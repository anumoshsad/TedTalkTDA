VI'm going to talk a little bit about strategy
p4
aVand its relationship with technology.
p5
aVWe tend to think of business strategy
p6
aVas being a rather abstract body
p7
aVof essentially economic thought,
p8
aVperhaps rather timeless.
p9
aVI'm going to argue that, in fact,
p10
aVbusiness strategy has always been premised
p11
aVon assumptions about technology,
p12
aVthat those assumptions are changing,
p13
aVand, in fact, changing quite dramatically,
p14
aVand that therefore what that will drive us to
p15
aVis a different concept of what we mean
p16
aVby business strategy.
p17
aa(lp18
VLet me start, if I may,
p19
aVwith a little bit of history.
p20
aVThe idea of strategy in business
p21
aVowes its origins to two intellectual giants:
p22
aVBruce Henderson, the founder of BCG,
p23
aVand Michael Porter, professor at the Harvard Business School.
p24
aVHenderson's central idea was what you might call
p25
aVthe Napoleonic idea of concentrating mass
p26
aVagainst weakness, of overwhelming the enemy.
p27
aVWhat Henderson recognized was that,
p28
aVin the business world,
p29
aVthere are many phenomena which are characterized
p30
aVby what economists would call increasing returns \u2014
p31
aVscale, experience.
p32
aVThe more you do of something,
p33
aVdisproportionately the better you get.
p34
aVAnd therefore he found a logic for investing
p35
aVin such kinds of overwhelming mass
p36
aVin order to achieve competitive advantage.
p37
aVAnd that was the first introduction
p38
aVof essentially a military concept of strategy
p39
aVinto the business world.
p40
aa(lp41
VPorter agreed with that premise,
p42
aVbut he qualified it.
p43
aVHe pointed out, correctly, that that's all very well,
p44
aVbut businesses actually have multiple steps to them.
p45
aVThey have different components,
p46
aVand each of those components might be driven
p47
aVby a different kind of strategy.
p48
aVA company or a business might actually be advantaged
p49
aVin some activities but disadvantaged in others.
p50
aVHe formed the concept of the value chain,
p51
aVessentially the sequence of steps with which
p52
aVa, shall we say, raw material, becomes a component,
p53
aVbecomes assembled into a finished product,
p54
aVand then is distributed, for example,
p55
aVand he argued that advantage accrued
p56
aVto each of those components,
p57
aVand that the advantage of the whole
p58
aVwas in some sense the sum or the average
p59
aVof that of its parts.
p60
aVAnd this idea of the value chain was predicated
p61
aVon the recognition that
p62
aVwhat holds a business together is transaction costs,
p63
aVthat in essence you need to coordinate,
p64
aVorganizations are more efficient at coordination
p65
aVthan markets, very often,
p66
aVand therefore the nature and role and boundaries
p67
aVof the cooperation are defined by transaction costs.
p68
aVIt was on those two ideas,
p69
aVHenderson's idea of increasing returns
p70
aVto scale and experience,
p71
aVand Porter's idea of the value chain,
p72
aVencompassing heterogenous elements,
p73
aVthat the whole edifice of business strategy
p74
aVwas subsequently erected.
p75
aa(lp76
VNow what I'm going to argue is
p77
aVthat those premises are, in fact, being invalidated.
p78
aVFirst of all, let's think about transaction costs.
p79
aVThere are really two components to transaction costs.
p80
aVOne is about processing information, and the other is about communication.
p81
aVThese are the economics of processing and communicating
p82
aVas they have evolved over a long period of time.
p83
aVAs we all know from so many contexts,
p84
aVthey have been radically transformed
p85
aVsince the days when Porter and Henderson
p86
aVfirst formulated their theories.
p87
aVIn particular, since the mid-'90s,
p88
aVcommunications costs have actually been falling
p89
aVeven faster than transaction costs,
p90
aVwhich is why communication, the Internet,
p91
aVhas exploded in such a dramatic fashion.
p92
aVNow, those falling transaction costs
p93
aVhave profound consequences,
p94
aVbecause if transaction costs are the glue
p95
aVthat hold value chains together, and they are falling,
p96
aVthere is less to economize on.
p97
aVThere is less need for vertically integrated organization,
p98
aVand value chains at least can break up.
p99
aVThey needn't necessarily, but they can.
p100
aVIn particular, it then becomes possible for
p101
aVa competitor in one business
p102
aVto use their position in one step of the value chain
p103
aVin order to penetrate or attack
p104
aVor disintermediate the competitor in another.
p105
aa(lp106
VThat is not just an abstract proposition.
p107
aVThere are many very specific stories
p108
aVof how that actually happened.
p109
aVA poster child example was the encyclopedia business.
p110
aVThe encyclopedia business
p111
aVin the days of leatherbound books
p112
aVwas basically a distribution business.
p113
aVMost of the cost was the commission to the salesmen.
p114
aVThe CD-ROM and then the Internet came along,
p115
aVnew technologies made the distribution of knowledge
p116
aVmany orders of magnitude cheaper,
p117
aVand the encyclopedia industry collapsed.
p118
aVIt's now, of course, a very familiar story.
p119
aVThis, in fact, more generally was the story
p120
aVof the first generation of the Internet economy.
p121
aVIt was about falling transaction costs
p122
aVbreaking up value chains
p123
aVand therefore allowing disintermediation,
p124
aVor what we call deconstruction.
p125
aa(lp126
VOne of the questions I was occasionally asked was,
p127
aVwell, what's going to replace the encyclopedia
p128
aVwhen Britannica no longer has a business model?
p129
aVAnd it was a while before the answer became manifest.
p130
aVNow, of course, we know what it is: it's the Wikipedia.
p131
aVNow what's special about the Wikipedia is not its distribution.
p132
aVWhat's special about the Wikipedia is the way it's produced.
p133
aVThe Wikipedia, of course, is an encyclopedia
p134
aVcreated by its users.
p135
aVAnd this, in fact, defines what you might call
p136
aVthe second decade of the Internet economy,
p137
aVthe decade in which the Internet as a noun
p138
aVbecame the Internet as a verb.
p139
aVIt became a set of conversations,
p140
aVthe era in which user-generated content and social networks
p141
aVbecame the dominant phenomenon.
p142
aVNow what that really meant
p143
aVin terms of the Porter-Henderson framework
p144
aVwas the collapse of certain kinds of economies of scale.
p145
aVIt turned out that tens of thousands
p146
aVof autonomous individuals writing an encyclopedia
p147
aVcould do just as good a job,
p148
aVand certainly a much cheaper job,
p149
aVthan professionals in a hierarchical organization.
p150
aVSo basically what was happening was that one layer
p151
aVof this value chain was becoming fragmented,
p152
aVas individuals could take over
p153
aVwhere organizations were no longer needed.
p154
aa(lp155
VBut there's another question that obviously this graph poses,
p156
aVwhich is, okay, we've gone through two decades \u2014
p157
aVdoes anything distinguish the third?
p158
aVAnd what I'm going to argue is that indeed
p159
aVsomething does distinguish the third,
p160
aVand it maps exactly on to the kind of
p161
aVPorter-Henderson logic that we've been talking about.
p162
aVAnd that is, about data.
p163
aVIf we go back to around 2000,
p164
aVa lot of people were talking about the information revolution,
p165
aVand it was indeed true that the world's stock of data
p166
aVwas growing, indeed growing quite fast.
p167
aVbut it was still at that point overwhelmingly analog.
p168
aVWe go forward to 2007,
p169
aVnot only had the world's stock of data exploded,
p170
aVbut there'd been this massive substitution
p171
aVof digital for analog.
p172
aVAnd more important even than that,
p173
aVif you look more carefully at this graph,
p174
aVwhat you will observe is that about a half
p175
aVof that digital data
p176
aVis information that has an I.P. address.
p177
aVIt's on a server or it's on a P.C.
p178
aVBut having an I.P. address means that it
p179
aVcan be connected to any other data
p180
aVthat has an I.P. address.
p181
aVIt means it becomes possible
p182
aVto put together half of the world's knowledge
p183
aVin order to see patterns,
p184
aVan entirely new thing.
p185
aVIf we run the numbers forward to today,
p186
aVit probably looks something like this.
p187
aVWe're not really sure.
p188
aVIf we run the numbers forward to 2020,
p189
aVwe of course have an exact number, courtesy of IDC.
p190
aVIt's curious that the future is so much more predictable than the present.
p191
aVAnd what it implies is a hundredfold multiplication
p192
aVin the stock of information that is connected
p193
aVvia an I.P. address.
p194
aVNow, if the number of connections that we can make
p195
aVis proportional to the number of pairs of data points,
p196
aVa hundredfold multiplication in the quantity of data
p197
aVis a ten-thousandfold multiplication
p198
aVin the number of patterns
p199
aVthat we can see in that data,
p200
aVthis just in the last 10 or 11 years.
p201
aVThis, I would submit, is a sea change,
p202
aVa profound change in the economics
p203
aVof the world that we live in.
p204
aa(lp205
VThe first human genome,
p206
aVthat of James Watson,
p207
aVwas mapped as the culmination of the Human Genome Project in the year 2000,
p208
aVand it took about 200 million dollars
p209
aVand about 10 years of work to map
p210
aVjust one person's genomic makeup.
p211
aVSince then, the costs of mapping the genome have come down.
p212
aVIn fact, they've come down in recent years
p213
aVvery dramatically indeed,
p214
aVto the point where the cost  is now below 1,000 dollars,
p215
aVand it's confidently predicted that by the year 2015
p216
aVit will be below 100 dollars \u2014
p217
aVa five or six order of magnitude drop
p218
aVin the cost of genomic mapping
p219
aVin just a 15-year period,
p220
aVan extraordinary phenomenon.
p221
aVNow, in the days when mapping a genome
p222
aVcost millions, or even tens of thousands,
p223
aVit was basically a research enterprise.
p224
aVScientists would gather some representative people,
p225
aVand they would see patterns, and they would try
p226
aVand make generalizations about human nature and disease
p227
aVfrom the abstract patterns they find
p228
aVfrom these particular selected individuals.
p229
aVBut when the genome can  be mapped for 100 bucks,
p230
aV99 dollars while you wait,
p231
aVthen what happens is, it becomes retail.
p232
aVIt becomes above all clinical.
p233
aVYou go the doctor with a cold,
p234
aVand if he or she hasn't done it already,
p235
aVthe first thing they do is map your genome,
p236
aVat which point what they're now doing
p237
aVis not starting from some abstract  knowledge of genomic medicine
p238
aVand trying to work out how it applies to you,
p239
aVbut they're starting from your particular genome.
p240
aVNow think of the power of that.
p241
aVThink of where that takes us
p242
aVwhen we can combine genomic data
p243
aVwith clinical data
p244
aVwith data about drug interactions
p245
aVwith the kind of ambient data that devices
p246
aVlike our phone and medical sensors
p247
aVwill increasingly be collecting.
p248
aVThink what happens when we collect all of that data
p249
aVand we can put it together
p250
aVin order to find patterns we wouldn't see before.
p251
aVThis, I would suggest, perhaps it will take a while,
p252
aVbut this will drive a revolution in medicine.
p253
aVFabulous, lots of people talk about this.
p254
aa(lp255
VBut there's one thing that doesn't get much attention.
p256
aVHow is that model of colossal sharing
p257
aVacross all of those kinds of databases
p258
aVcompatible with the business models
p259
aVof institutions and organizations and corporations
p260
aVthat are involved in this business today?
p261
aVIf your business is based on proprietary data,
p262
aVif your competitive advantage is defined by your data,
p263
aVhow on Earth is that company or is that society
p264
aVin fact going to achieve the value
p265
aVthat's implicit in the technology? They can't.
p266
aa(lp267
VSo essentially what's happening here,
p268
aVand genomics is merely one example of this,
p269
aVis that technology is driving
p270
aVthe natural scaling of the activity
p271
aVbeyond the institutional boundaries within which
p272
aVwe have been used to thinking about it,
p273
aVand in particular beyond the institutional boundaries
p274
aVin terms of which business strategy
p275
aVas a discipline is formulated.
p276
aVThe basic story here is that what used to be
p277
aVvertically integrated, oligopolistic competition
p278
aVamong essentially similar kinds of competitors
p279
aVis evolving, by one means or another,
p280
aVfrom a vertical structure to a horizontal one.
p281
aVWhy is that happening?
p282
aVIt's happening because transaction costs are plummeting
p283
aVand because scale is polarizing.
p284
aVThe plummeting of transaction costs
p285
aVweakens the glue that holds value chains together,
p286
aVand allows them to separate.
p287
aVThe polarization of scale economies
p288
aVtowards the very small \u2014 small is beautiful \u2014
p289
aVallows for scalable communities
p290
aVto substitute for conventional corporate production.
p291
aVThe scaling in the opposite direction,
p292
aVtowards things like big data,
p293
aVdrive the structure of business
p294
aVtowards the creation of new kinds of institutions
p295
aVthat can achieve that scale.
p296
aVBut either way, the typically vertical structure
p297
aVgets driven to becoming more horizontal.
p298
aa(lp299
VThe logic isn't just about big data.
p300
aVIf we were to look, for example, at the telecommunications industry,
p301
aVyou can tell the same story about fiber optics.
p302
aVIf we look at the pharmaceutical industry,
p303
aVor, for that matter, university research,
p304
aVyou can say exactly the same story
p305
aVabout so-called "big science."
p306
aVAnd in the opposite direction,
p307
aVif we look, say, at the energy sector,
p308
aVwhere all the talk is about how households
p309
aVwill be efficient producers of green energy
p310
aVand efficient conservers of energy,
p311
aVthat is, in fact, the reverse phenomenon.
p312
aVThat is the fragmentation of scale
p313
aVbecause the very small can substitute
p314
aVfor the traditional corporate scale.
p315
aa(lp316
VEither way, what we are driven to
p317
aVis this horizontalization of the structure of industries,
p318
aVand that implies fundamental changes
p319
aVin how we think about strategy.
p320
aVIt means, for example, that we need to think
p321
aVabout strategy as the curation
p322
aVof these kinds of horizontal structure,
p323
aVwhere things like business definition
p324
aVand even industry definition
p325
aVare actually the outcomes of strategy,
p326
aVnot something that the strategy presupposes.
p327
aVIt means, for example, we need to work out
p328
aVhow to accommodate collaboration
p329
aVand competition simultaneously.
p330
aVThink about the genome.
p331
aVWe need to accommodate the very large
p332
aVand the very small simultaneously.
p333
aVAnd we need industry structures
p334
aVthat will accommodate very, very different motivations,
p335
aVfrom the amateur motivations of people in communities
p336
aVto maybe the social motivations
p337
aVof infrastructure built by governments,
p338
aVor, for that matter, cooperative institutions
p339
aVbuilt by companies that are otherwise competing,
p340
aVbecause that is the only way that they can get to scale.
p341
aa(lp342
VThese kinds of transformations
p343
aVrender the traditional premises  of business strategy obsolete.
p344
aVThey drive us into a completely new world.
p345
aVThey require us, whether we are
p346
aVin the public sector or the private sector,
p347
aVto think very fundamentally differently
p348
aVabout the structure of business,
p349
aVand, at last, it makes strategy interesting again.
