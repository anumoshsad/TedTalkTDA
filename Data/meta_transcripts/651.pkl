VWhat we're really here to talk about is the "how."
p4
aVOkay, so how exactly do we create this
p5
aVworld-shattering, if you will, innovation?
p6
aVNow, I want to tell you a quick story.
p7
aVWe'll go back a little more than a year.
p8
aVIn fact, the date \u2014 I'm curious to know
p9
aVif any of you know what happened on this momentous date?
p10
aVIt was February 3rd, 2008.
p11
aVAnyone remember what happened,
p12
aVFebruary 3rd, 2008?
p13
aVSuper Bowl. I heard it over here. It was the date of the Super Bowl.
p14
aa(lp15
VAnd the reason that this date was so momentous
p16
aVis that what my colleagues, John King
p17
aVand Halee Fischer-Wright, and I noticed
p18
aVas we began to debrief various Super Bowl parties,
p19
aVis that it seemed to us
p20
aVthat across the United States,
p21
aVif you will, tribal councils had convened.
p22
aVAnd they had discussed things of great national importance.
p23
aVLike, "Do we like the Budweiser commercial?"
p24
aVand, "Do we like the nachos?" and, "Who is going to win?"
p25
aVBut they also talked about which candidate they were going to support.
p26
aa(lp27
VAnd if you go back in time to February 3rd,
p28
aVit looked like Hilary Clinton was going to get the Democratic nomination.
p29
aVAnd there were even some polls that were saying she was going to go all the way.
p30
aVBut when we talked to people,
p31
aVit appeared that a funnel effect had happened
p32
aVin these tribes all across the United States.
p33
aVNow what is a tribe? A tribe is a group of
p34
aVabout 20 \u2014 so kind of more than a team \u2014
p35
aV20 to about 150 people.
p36
aVAnd it's within these tribes that all of our work gets done.
p37
aVBut not just work. It's within these tribes
p38
aVthat societies get built,
p39
aVthat important things happen.
p40
aa(lp41
VAnd so as we surveyed the, if you will, representatives
p42
aVfrom various tribal councils that met,
p43
aValso known as Super Bowl parties,
p44
aVwe sent the following email off to 40 newspaper editors the following day.
p45
aVFebruary 4th, we posted it on our website. This was before Super Tuesday.
p46
aVWe said, "The tribes that we're in
p47
aVare saying it's going to be Obama."
p48
aVNow, the reason we knew that
p49
aVwas because we spent the previous 10 years
p50
aVstudying tribes, studying these naturally occurring groups.
p51
aa(lp52
VAll of you are members of tribes.
p53
aVIn walking around at the break,
p54
aVmany of you had met members of your tribe. And you were talking to them.
p55
aVAnd many of you were doing what great, if you will, tribal leaders do,
p56
aVwhich is to find someone
p57
aVwho is a member of a tribe,
p58
aVand to find someone else who is another member of a different tribe,
p59
aVand make introductions.
p60
aVThat is in fact what great tribal leaders do.
p61
aa(lp62
VSo here is the bottom line.
p63
aVIf you focus in on a group like this \u2014
p64
aVthis happens to be a USC game \u2014
p65
aVand you zoom in with one of those super satellite cameras
p66
aVand do magnification factors so you could see individual people,
p67
aVyou would in fact see not a single crowd,
p68
aVjust like there is not a single crowd here,
p69
aVbut you would see these tribes that are then coming together.
p70
aVAnd from a distance it appears that it's a single group.
p71
aVAnd so people form tribes.
p72
aVThey always have. They always will.
p73
aVJust as fish swim and birds fly,
p74
aVpeople form tribes. It's just what we do.
p75
aVBut here's the rub.
p76
aVNot all tribes are the same,
p77
aVand what makes the difference is the culture.
p78
aa(lp79
VNow here is the net out of this.
p80
aVYou're all a member of tribes.
p81
aVIf you can find a way to take the tribes that you're in
p82
aVand nudge them forward,
p83
aValong these tribal stages
p84
aVto what we call Stage Five, which is the top of the mountain.
p85
aVBut we're going to start with what we call Stage One.
p86
aVNow, this is the lowest of the stages.
p87
aVYou don't want this. Okay?
p88
aVThis is a bit of a difficult image to put up on the screen.
p89
aVBut it's one that I think we need to learn from.
p90
aa(lp91
VStage One produces people
p92
aVwho do horrible things.
p93
aVThis is the kid who shot up Virginia Tech.
p94
aVStage One is a group where people
p95
aVsystematically sever relationships from functional tribes,
p96
aVand then pool together
p97
aVwith people who think like they do.
p98
aVStage One is literally the culture of gangs
p99
aVand it is the culture of prisons.
p100
aVNow, again, we don't often deal with Stage One.
p101
aVAnd I want to make the point
p102
aVthat as members of society, we need to.
p103
aVIt's not enough to simply write people off.
p104
aa(lp105
VBut let's move on to Stage Two.
p106
aVNow, Stage One, you'll notice, says, in effect, "Life Sucks."
p107
aVSo, this other book that Steve mentioned,
p108
aVthat just came out, called "The Three Laws of Performance,"
p109
aVmy colleague, Steve Zaffron and I,
p110
aVargue that as people see the world, so they behave.
p111
aVWell, if people see the world in such a way that life sucks,
p112
aVthen their behavior will follow automatically from that.
p113
aVIt will be despairing hostility.
p114
aVThey'll do whatever it takes to survive,
p115
aVeven if that means undermining other people.
p116
aa(lp117
VNow, my birthday is coming up shortly,
p118
aVand my driver's license expires.
p119
aVAnd the reason that that's relevant is that very soon
p120
aVI will be walking into what we call
p121
aVa Stage Two tribe,
p122
aVwhich looks like this.
p123
aV(Laughter)
p124
aVNow, am I saying that in every Department of Motor Vehicles
p125
aVacross the land, you find a Stage Two culture?
p126
aVNo. But in the one near me,
p127
aVwhere I have to go in just a few days,
p128
aVwhat I will say when I'm standing in line is,
p129
aV"How can people be so dumb, and yet live?"
p130
aV(Laughter)
p131
aa(lp132
VNow, am I saying that there are dumb people working here?
p133
aVActually, no, I'm not.
p134
aVBut I'm saying the culture makes people dumb.
p135
aVSo in a Stage Two culture \u2014
p136
aVand we find these in all sorts of different places \u2014
p137
aVyou find them, in fact, in the best organizations in the world.
p138
aVYou find them in all places in society.
p139
aVI've come across them at the organizations
p140
aVthat everybody raves about as being best in class.
p141
aVBut here is the point. If you believe and you say
p142
aVto people in your tribe, in effect,
p143
aV"My life sucks.
p144
aVI mean, if I got to go to TEDx USC
p145
aVmy life wouldn't suck. But I don't. So it does."
p146
aVIf that's how you talked, imagine what kind of work would get done.
p147
aVWhat kind of innovation would get done?
p148
aVThe amount of world-changing behavior that would happen?
p149
aVIn fact it would be basically nil.
p150
aa(lp151
VNow when we go on to Stage Three: this is the one
p152
aVthat hits closest to home for many of us.
p153
aVBecause it is in Stage Three that many of us move.
p154
aVAnd we park. And we stay.
p155
aVStage Three says, "I'm great. And you're not."
p156
aV(Laughter)
p157
aVI'm great and you're not.
p158
aVNow imagine having a whole room of people
p159
aVsaying, in effect, "I'm great and you're not."
p160
aVOr, "I'm going to find some way to compete with you
p161
aVand come out on top as a result of that."
p162
aVA whole group of people communicating that way, talking that way.
p163
aa(lp164
VI know this sounds like a joke. Three doctors walk into a bar.
p165
aVBut, in this case, three doctors walk into an elevator.
p166
aVI happened to be in the elevator collecting data for this book.
p167
aVAnd one doctor said to the others, "Did you see my article
p168
aVin the New England Journal of Medicine?"
p169
aVAnd the other said, "No. That's great. Congratulations!"
p170
aa(lp171
VThe next one got kind of a wry smile on his face and said,
p172
aV"Well while you were, you know, doing your research," \u2014
p173
aVnotice the condescending tone \u2014
p174
aV"While you were off doing your research, I was off doing more surgeries
p175
aVthan anyone else in the department of surgery at this institution."
p176
aa(lp177
VAnd the third one got the same wry smile and said,
p178
aV"Well, while you were off doing your research,
p179
aVand you were off doing your monkey meatball surgery,
p180
aVthat eventually we'll train monkeys to do,
p181
aVor cells or robots, or maybe not even need to do it at all,
p182
aVI was off running the future of the residency program,
p183
aVwhich is really the future of medicine."
p184
aa(lp185
VAnd they all kind of laughed and they patted him on the back.
p186
aVAnd the elevator door opened, and they all walked out.
p187
aVThat is a meeting of a Stage Three tribe.
p188
aVNow, we find these in places
p189
aVwhere really smart, successful people show up.
p190
aVLike, oh, I don't know, TEDx USC.
p191
aV(Laughter)
p192
aa(lp193
VHere is the greatest challenge we face in innovation.
p194
aVIt is moving from Stage Three
p195
aVto Stage Four.
p196
aVLet's take a look at a quick video snippet.
p197
aVThis is from a company called Zappos, located outside Las Vegas.
p198
aVAnd my question on the other side is just going to be,
p199
aV"What do you think they value?"
p200
aVIt was not Christmas time. There was a Christmas tree.
p201
aVThis is their lobby.
p202
aVEmployees volunteer time in the advice booth.
p203
aVNotice it looks like something out of a Peanuts cartoon.
p204
aa(lp205
VOkay, we're going through the hallway here at Zappos.
p206
aVThis is a call center. Notice how it's decorated.
p207
aVNotice people are applauding for us.
p208
aVThey don't know who we are and they don't care. And if they did
p209
aVthey probably wouldn't applaud.
p210
aVBut you'll notice the level of excitement.
p211
aVNotice, again, how they decorate their office.
p212
aVNow, what's important to people at Zappos,
p213
aVthese may not be the things that are important to you.
p214
aVBut they value things like fun. And they value creativity.
p215
aVOne of their stated values is, "Be a little bit weird."
p216
aVAnd you'll notice they are a little bit weird.
p217
aa(lp218
VSo when individuals come together
p219
aVand find something that unites them
p220
aVthat's greater than their individual competence,
p221
aVthen something very important happens.
p222
aVThe group gels. And it changes
p223
aVfrom a group of highly motivated
p224
aVbut fairly individually-centric people
p225
aVinto something larger,
p226
aVinto a tribe that becomes aware of its own existence.
p227
aVStage Four tribes can do remarkable things.
p228
aVBut you'll notice we're not at the top of the mountain yet.
p229
aVThere is, in fact, another stage.
p230
aa(lp231
VNow, some of you may not recognize the scene that's up here.
p232
aVAnd if you take a look at the headline of Stage Five, which is "Life is Great,"
p233
aVthis may seem a little incongruous.
p234
aVThis is a scene or snippet
p235
aVfrom the Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa
p236
aVfor which Desmond Tutu won the Nobel Prize.
p237
aVNow think about that. South Africa,
p238
aVterrible atrocities had happened in the society.
p239
aVAnd people came together
p240
aVfocused only on those two values: truth and reconciliation.
p241
aVThere was no road map. No one had ever done
p242
aVanything like this before.
p243
aa(lp244
VAnd in this atmosphere, where the only guidance
p245
aVwas people's values and their noble cause,
p246
aVwhat this group accomplished was historic.
p247
aVAnd people, at the time, feared that South Africa
p248
aVwould end up going the way that Rwanda has gone,
p249
aVdescending into one skirmish after another
p250
aVin a civil war that seems to have no end.
p251
aVIn fact, South Africa has not gone down that road.
p252
aVLargely because people like Desmond Tutu
p253
aVset up a Stage Five process
p254
aVto involve the thousands and perhaps millions
p255
aVof tribes in the country, to bring everyone together.
p256
aVSo, people hear this and they conclude the following,
p257
aVas did we in doing the study.
p258
aa(lp259
VOkay, got it. I don't want to talk Stage One.
p260
aVThat's like, you know, "Life sucks." Who wants to talk that way?
p261
aVI don't want to talk like they do
p262
aVat the particular DMV that's close to where Dave lives.
p263
aVI really don't want to just say "I'm great,"
p264
aVbecause that kind of sounds narcissistic, and then I won't have any friends.
p265
aVSaying, "We're great" \u2014 that sounds pretty good.
p266
aVBut I should really talk Stage Five, right? "Life is great."
p267
aa(lp268
VWell, in fact, there are three somewhat counter-intuitive findings
p269
aVthat come out of all this.
p270
aVThe first one, if you look at the Declaration of Independence
p271
aVand actually read it,
p272
aVthe phrase that sticks in many of our minds
p273
aVis things about inalienable rights.
p274
aVI mean, that's Stage Five, right? Life is great,
p275
aVoriented only by our values,
p276
aVno other guidance.
p277
aVIn fact, most of the document is written at Stage Two.
p278
aV"My life sucks because I live under a tyrant,
p279
aValso known as King George.
p280
aVWe're great! Who is not great? England!"
p281
aVSorry. (Laughter)
p282
aa(lp283
VWell, what about other great leaders? What about Gandhi?
p284
aVWhat about Martin Luther King?
p285
aVI mean, surely these were just people who preached, "Life is great," right?
p286
aVJust one little bit of happiness and joy after another.
p287
aVIn fact, Martin Luther King's most famous line was at Stage Three.
p288
aVHe didn't say "We have a dream." He said, "I have a dream."
p289
aVWhy did he do that? Because most people
p290
aVare not at Stage Five.
p291
aa(lp292
VTwo percent are at Stage One.
p293
aVAbout 25 percent are at Stage Two,
p294
aVsaying, in effect, "My life sucks."
p295
aV48 percent of working tribes say, these are employed tribes,
p296
aVsay, "I'm great and you're not."
p297
aVAnd we have to duke it out every day, so we resort to politics.
p298
aVOnly about 22 percent of tribes
p299
aVare at Stage Four,
p300
aVoriented by our values, saying "We're great.
p301
aVAnd our values are beginning to unite us."
p302
aVOnly two percent, only two percent of tribes
p303
aVget to Stage Five.
p304
aVAnd those are the ones that change the world.
p305
aa(lp306
VSo the first little finding from this
p307
aVis that leaders need to be able to talk all the levels
p308
aVso that you can touch every person in society.
p309
aVBut you don't leave them where you found them. Okay?
p310
aVTribes can only hear one level above and below where they are.
p311
aVSo we have to have the ability to talk
p312
aVall the levels, to go to where they are.
p313
aVAnd then leaders nudge people
p314
aVwithin their tribes to the next level.
p315
aVI'd like to show you some examples of this.
p316
aa(lp317
VOne of the people we interviewed was Frank Jordan,
p318
aVformer Mayor of San Francisco. Before that
p319
aVhe was Chief of Police in San Francisco.
p320
aVAnd he grew up essentially in Stage One.
p321
aVAnd you know what changed his life? It was walking into
p322
aVone of these, a Boys and Girls Club.
p323
aVNow here is what happened to this person
p324
aVwho eventually became Mayor of San Francisco.
p325
aVHe went from being alive and passionate
p326
aVat Stage One \u2014 remember, "Life sucks,
p327
aVdespairing hostility, I will do whatever it takes to survive" \u2014
p328
aVto walking into a Boys and Girls Club,
p329
aVfolding his arms, sitting down in a chair,
p330
aVand saying, "Wow. My life really sucks.
p331
aVI don't know anybody.
p332
aVI mean, if I was into boxing, like they were,
p333
aVthen my life wouldn't suck. But I don't. So it does.
p334
aVSo I'm going to sit here in my chair and not do anything."
p335
aa(lp336
VIn fact, that's progress.
p337
aVWe move people from Stage One to Stage Two
p338
aVby getting them in a new tribe
p339
aVand then, over time, getting them connected.
p340
aVSo, what about moving
p341
aVfrom Stage Three to Stage Four?
p342
aVI want to argue that we're doing that right here.
p343
aVTED represents a set of values,
p344
aVand as we unite around these values,
p345
aVsomething really interesting begins to emerge.
p346
aa(lp347
VIf you want this experience to live on
p348
aVas something historic,
p349
aVthen at the reception tonight I'd like to encourage you to do something
p350
aVbeyond what people normally do
p351
aVand call networking.
p352
aVWhich is not just to meet new people
p353
aVand extend your reach, extend your influence,
p354
aVbut instead, find someone you don't know,
p355
aVand find someone else you don't know,
p356
aVand introduce them.
p357
aVThat's called a triadic relationship.
p358
aa(lp359
VSee, people who build world-changing tribes do that.
p360
aVThey extend the reach of their tribes
p361
aVby connecting them, not just to myself,
p362
aVso that my following is greater,
p363
aVbut I connect people who don't know each other
p364
aVto something greater than themselves.
p365
aVAnd ultimately that adds to their values.
p366
aa(lp367
VBut we're not done yet. Because then how do we go from Stage Four,
p368
aVwhich is great, to Stage Five?
p369
aVThe story that I like to end with is this. It comes out of
p370
aVa place called the Gallup Organization.
p371
aVYou know they do polls, right?
p372
aVSo it's Stage Four. We're great. Who is not great?
p373
aVPretty much everybody else who does polls.
p374
aVIf Gallup releases a poll on the same day that NBC releases a poll,
p375
aVpeople will pay attention to the Gallup poll. Okay, we understand that.
p376
aVSo, they were bored.
p377
aVThey wanted to change the world. So here is the question someone asked.
p378
aa(lp379
V"How could we,
p380
aVinstead of just polling what Asia thinks
p381
aVor what the United States thinks,
p382
aVor who thinks what about Obama
p383
aVversus McCain or something like that,
p384
aVwhat does the entire world think?"
p385
aVAnd they found a way to do the first-ever world poll.
p386
aVThey had people involved who were Nobel laureates
p387
aVin economics, who reported being bored.
p388
aVAnd suddenly they pulled out sheets of paper
p389
aVand were trying to figure out, "How do we survey the population
p390
aVof Sub-Saharan Africa?
p391
aVHow do we survey populations that don't have access to technology,
p392
aVand speak languages we don't speak,
p393
aVand we don't know anyone who speaks those languages. Because in order
p394
aVto achieve on this great mission,
p395
aVwe have to be able to do it.
p396
aVIncidentally, they did pull it off.
p397
aVAnd they released the first-ever world poll.
p398
aa(lp399
VSo I'd like to leave you with these thoughts.
p400
aVFirst of all: we all form tribes, all of us.
p401
aVYou're in tribes here. Hopefully you're extending the reach
p402
aVof the tribes that you have.
p403
aVBut the question on the table is this:
p404
aVWhat kind of an impact are the tribes
p405
aVthat you are in making?
p406
aVYou're hearing one presentation after another,
p407
aVoften representing a group of people, a tribe,
p408
aVabout how they have changed the world.
p409
aVIf you do what we've talked about, you listen
p410
aVfor how people actually communicate in the tribes that you're in.
p411
aVAnd you don't leave them where they are. You nudge them forward.
p412
aVYou remember to talk all five culture stages.
p413
aVBecause we've got people in all five, around us.
p414
aVAnd the question that I'd like to leave you with is this:
p415
aVWill your tribes change the world?
p416
aVThank you very much.
