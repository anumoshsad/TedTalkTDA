(lp3
VSo I'm a doctor, but I kind of slipped sideways into research,
p4
aVand now I'm an epidemiologist.
p5
aVAnd nobody really knows what epidemiology is.
p6
aVEpidemiology is the science of how we know in the real world
p7
aVif something is good for you or bad for you.
p8
aVAnd it's best understood through example
p9
aVas the science of those crazy, wacky newspaper headlines.
p10
aVAnd these are just some of the examples.
p11
aa(lp12
VThese are from the Daily Mail.
p13
aVEvery country in the world has a newspaper like this.
p14
aVIt has this bizarre, ongoing philosophical project
p15
aVof dividing all the inanimate objects in the world
p16
aVinto the ones that either cause or prevent cancer.
p17
aVHere are some of the things they said cause cancer:
p18
aVdivorce, Wi-Fi, toiletries and coffee.
p19
aVSome things they say prevent cancer:
p20
aVcrusts, red pepper, licorice and coffee.
p21
aVSo you can see there are contradictions.
p22
aVCoffee both causes and prevents cancer.
p23
aVAs you start to read on, you can see
p24
aVthat maybe there's some political valence behind some of this.
p25
aVFor women, housework prevents breast cancer,
p26
aVbut for men, shopping could make you impotent.
p27
aa(lp28
V(Laughter)
p29
aa(lp30
VSo we know that we need to start unpicking the science behind this.
p31
aVAnd what I hope to show is that unpicking the evidence behind dodgy claims
p32
aVisn't a kind of nasty, carping activity;
p33
aVit's socially useful.
p34
aVBut it's also an extremely valuable explanatory tool,
p35
aVbecause real science is about critically appraising the evidence
p36
aVfor somebody else's position.
p37
aVThat's what happens in academic journals,
p38
aVit's what happens at academic conferences \u2014
p39
aVthe Q&A session after a postdoc presents data is often a bloodbath.
p40
aVAnd nobody minds that; we actively welcome it.
p41
aVIt's like a consenting intellectual S&M activity.
p42
aa(lp43
V(Laughter)
p44
aa(lp45
VSo what I'm going to show you is all of the main things,
p46
aVall of the main features of my discipline, evidence-based medicine.
p47
aVAnd I will talk you through all of these and demonstrate how they work,
p48
aVexclusively using examples of people getting stuff wrong.
p49
aa(lp50
VWe'll start with the absolute weakest form of evidence known to man,
p51
aVand that is authority.
p52
aVIn science, we don't care how many letters you have after your name \u2014
p53
aVwe want to know what your reasons are for believing something.
p54
aVHow do you know that something is good for us or bad for us?
p55
aVBut we're also unimpressed by authority because it's so easy to contrive.
p56
aVThis is somebody called Dr. Gillian McKeith, PhD,
p57
aVor, to give her full medical title, Gillian McKeith.
p58
aa(lp59
V(Laughter)
p60
aa(lp61
VAgain, every country has somebody like this.
p62
aVShe is our TV diet guru.
p63
aVShe has five series of prime-time television,
p64
aVgiving out very lavish and exotic health advice.
p65
aVShe, it turns out, has a non-accredited correspondence course PhD
p66
aVfrom somewhere in America.
p67
aVShe also boasts that she's a certified professional member
p68
aVof the American Association of Nutritional Consultants,
p69
aVwhich sounds very glamorous; you get a certificate.
p70
aVThis one belongs to my dead cat, Hettie. She was a horrible cat.
p71
aVYou go to the website, fill out the form,
p72
aVgive them $60, it arrives in the post.
p73
aVThat's not the only reason we think this person is an idiot.
p74
aVShe also says things like eat lots of dark green leaves,
p75
aVthey contain chlorophyll and really oxygenate your blood.
p76
aVAnd anybody who's done school biology remembers
p77
aVthat chlorophyll and chloroplasts only make oxygen in sunlight,
p78
aVand it's quite dark in your bowels after you've eaten spinach.
p79
aa(lp80
VNext, we need proper science, proper evidence.
p81
aVSo: "Red wine can help prevent breast cancer."
p82
aVThis is a headline from The Daily Telegraph in the UK.
p83
aV"A glass of red wine a day could help prevent breast cancer."
p84
aVSo you find this paper, and find that it is a real piece of science.
p85
aVIt's a description of the changes in the behavior of one enzyme
p86
aVwhen you drip a chemical extracted from some red grape skin
p87
aVonto some cancer cells
p88
aVin a dish on a bench in a laboratory somewhere.
p89
aVAnd that's a really useful thing to describe in a scientific paper.
p90
aVBut on the question of your own personal risk of getting breast cancer
p91
aVif you drink red wine,
p92
aVit tells you absolutely bugger all.
p93
aVActually, it turns out that your risk of breast cancer
p94
aVincreases slightly with every amount of alcohol you drink.
p95
aVSo what we want are studies in real human people.
p96
aa(lp97
VAnd here's another example.
p98
aVThis is from Britain's "leading" diet nutritionist in the Daily Mirror,
p99
aVour second-biggest selling newspaper.
p100
aV"An Australian study in 2001 found that olive oil,
p101
aVin combination with fruits, vegetables and pulses,
p102
aVoffers measurable protection against skin wrinklings,"
p103
aVand give the advice:
p104
aV"If you eat olive oil and vegetables, you'll have fewer wrinkles."
p105
aVThey helpfully tell you how to find the paper,
p106
aVand what you find is an observational study.
p107
aVObviously, nobody has been able to go back to 1930,
p108
aVget all the people born in one maternity unit,
p109
aVand half of them eat lots of fruit and veg and olive oil,
p110
aVhalf of them eat McDonald's,
p111
aVand then we see how many wrinkles you've got later.
p112
aa(lp113
VYou have to take a snapshot of how people are now.
p114
aVAnd what you find is, of course:
p115
aVpeople who eat veg and olive oil have fewer wrinkles.
p116
aVBut that's because people who eat fruit and veg and olive oil are freaks \u2014
p117
aVthey're not normal, they're like you; they come to events like this.
p118
aa(lp119
V(Laughter)
p120
aa(lp121
VThey're posh, they're wealthy, less likely to have outdoor jobs,
p122
aVless likely to do manual labor,
p123
aVthey have better social support, are less likely to smoke;
p124
aVfor a host of fascinating, interlocking
p125
aVsocial, political and cultural reasons,
p126
aVthey're less likely to have wrinkles.
p127
aVThat doesn't mean it's the vegetables or olive oil.
p128
aa(lp129
V(Laughter)
p130
aa(lp131
VSo ideally, what you want to do is a trial.
p132
aVPeople think they're familiar with the idea of a trial.
p133
aVTrials are old; the first one was in the Bible, Daniel 1:12.
p134
aVIt's straightforward: take a bunch of people, split them in half,
p135
aVtreat one group one way, the other group, the other way.
p136
aVA while later, you see what happened to each of them.
p137
aVI'm going to tell you about one trial,
p138
aVwhich is probably the most well-reported trial
p139
aVin the UK news media over the past decade.
p140
aVThis is the trial of fish oil pills.
p141
aVThe claim: fish oil pills improve school performance and behavior
p142
aVin mainstream children.
p143
aVThey said, "We did a trial.
p144
aVAll the previous ones were positive, this one will be too."
p145
aVThat should ring alarm bells:
p146
aVif you know the answer to your trial, you shouldn't be doing one.
p147
aVEither you've rigged it by design,
p148
aVor you've got enough data so there's no need to randomize people anymore.
p149
aa(lp150
VSo this is what they were going to do in their trial:
p151
aVThey were taking 3,000 children,
p152
aVthey were going to give them these huge fish oil pills, six of them a day,
p153
aVand then, a year later, measure their school exam performance
p154
aVand compare their performance
p155
aVagainst what they predicted their exam performance would have been
p156
aVif they hadn't had the pills.
p157
aVNow, can anybody spot a flaw in this design?
p158
aa(lp159
V(Laughter)
p160
aa(lp161
VAnd no professors of clinical trial methodology
p162
aVare allowed to answer this question.
p163
aVSo there's no control group.
p164
aVBut that sounds really techie, right? That's a technical term.
p165
aVThe kids got the pills, and their performance improved.
p166
aa(lp167
VWhat else could it possibly be if it wasn't the pills?
p168
aVThey got older; we all develop over time.
p169
aVAnd of course, there's the placebo effect,
p170
aVone of the most fascinating things in the whole of medicine.
p171
aVIt's not just taking a pill and performance or pain improving;
p172
aVit's about our beliefs and expectations, the cultural meaning of a treatment.
p173
aVAnd this has been demonstrated in a whole raft of fascinating studies
p174
aVcomparing one kind of placebo against another.
p175
aVSo we know, for example,
p176
aVthat two sugar pills a day are a more effective treatment
p177
aVfor gastric ulcers
p178
aVthan one sugar pill.
p179
aVTwo sugar pills a day beats one a day.
p180
aVThat's an outrageous and ridiculous finding, but it's true.
p181
aVWe know from three different studies on three different types of pain
p182
aVthat a saltwater injection is a more effective treatment
p183
aVthan a sugar pill, a dummy pill with no medicine in it,
p184
aVnot because the injection or pills do anything physically to the body,
p185
aVbut because an injection feels like a much more dramatic intervention.
p186
aVSo we know that our beliefs and expectations can be manipulated,
p187
aVwhich is why we do trials where we control against a placebo,
p188
aVwhere one half of the people get the real treatment,
p189
aVand the other half get placebo.
p190
aa(lp191
VBut that's not enough.
p192
aVWhat I've just shown you are examples
p193
aVof the very simple and straightforward ways
p194
aVthat journalists and food supplement pill peddlers and naturopaths
p195
aVcan distort evidence for their own purposes.
p196
aVWhat I find really fascinating
p197
aVis that the pharmaceutical industry uses exactly the same kinds
p198
aVof tricks and devices,
p199
aVbut slightly more sophisticated versions of them,
p200
aVin order to distort the evidence they give to doctors and patients,
p201
aVand which we use to make vitally important decisions.
p202
aa(lp203
VSo firstly, trials against placebo:
p204
aVeverybody thinks a trial should be a comparison
p205
aVof your new drug against placebo.
p206
aVBut in a lot of situations that's wrong;
p207
aVoften, we already have a good treatment currently available.
p208
aVSo we don't want to know that your alternative new treatment
p209
aVis better than nothing,
p210
aVbut that it's better than the best available treatment we have.
p211
aVAnd yet, repeatedly, you consistently see people doing trials
p212
aVstill against placebo.
p213
aVAnd you can get licensed to bring your drug to market
p214
aVwith only data showing that it's better than nothing,
p215
aVwhich is useless for a doctor like me trying to make a decision.
p216
aa(lp217
VBut that's not the only way you can rig your data.
p218
aVYou can also rig your data
p219
aVby making the thing you compare your new drug against
p220
aVreally rubbish.
p221
aVYou can give the competing drug in too low a dose,
p222
aVso people aren't properly treated.
p223
aVYou can give the competing drug in too high a dose,
p224
aVso people get side effects.
p225
aVAnd this is exactly what happened
p226
aVwith antipsychotic medication for schizophrenia.
p227
aVTwenty years ago, a new generation of antipsychotic drugs were brought in;
p228
aVthe promise was they would have fewer side effects.
p229
aVSo people set about doing trials of the new drugs against the old drugs.
p230
aVBut they gave the old drugs in ridiculously high doses:
p231
aV20 milligrams a day of haloperidol.
p232
aVAnd it's a foregone conclusion if you give a drug at that high a dose,
p233
aVit will have more side effects, and your new drug will look better.
p234
aa(lp235
VTen years ago, history repeated itself,
p236
aVwhen risperidone, the first of the new-generation antipsychotic drugs,
p237
aVcame off copyright, so anybody could make copies.
p238
aVEverybody wanted to show their drug was better than risperidone,
p239
aVso you see trials comparing new antipsychotic drugs
p240
aVagainst risperidone at eight milligrams a day.
p241
aVAgain, not an insane dose, not an illegal dose,
p242
aVbut very much at the high end of normal.
p243
aVSo you're bound to make your new drug look better.
p244
aVAnd so it's no surprise that overall,
p245
aVindustry-funded trials are four times more likely
p246
aVto give a positive result
p247
aVthan independently sponsored trials.
p248
aa(lp249
VBut \u2014 and it's a big but \u2014
p250
aa(lp251
V(Laughter)
p252
aa(lp253
Vit turns out,
p254
aVwhen you look at the methods used by industry-funded trials,
p255
aVthat they're actually better than independently sponsored trials.
p256
aVAnd yet, they always manage to get the result that they want.
p257
aVSo how does this work?
p258
aa(lp259
V(Laughter)
p260
aa(lp261
VHow can we explain this strange phenomenon?
p262
aVWell, it turns out that what happens
p263
aVis the negative data goes missing in action;
p264
aVit's withheld from doctors and patients.
p265
aVAnd this is the most important aspect of the whole story.
p266
aVIt's at the top of the pyramid of evidence.
p267
aVWe need to have all of the data on a particular treatment
p268
aVto know whether or not it really is effective.
p269
aVThere are two different ways you can spot whether some data has gone missing.
p270
aVYou can use statistics or you can use stories.
p271
aVI prefer statistics, so that's what I'll do first.
p272
aa(lp273
VThis is a funnel plot.
p274
aVA funnel plot is a very clever way of spotting
p275
aVif small negative trials have disappeared, have gone missing in action.
p276
aVThis is a graph of all of the trials done on a particular treatment.
p277
aVAs you go up towards the top of the graph,
p278
aVwhat you see is each dot is a trial.
p279
aVAs you go up, those are bigger trials, so they've got less error;
p280
aVthey're less likely to be randomly false positives or negatives.
p281
aVSo they all cluster together.
p282
aVThe big trials are closer to the true answer.
p283
aVThen as you go further down at the bottom,
p284
aVwhat you can see is, on this side, spurious false negatives,
p285
aVand over on this side, spurious false positives.
p286
aVIf there is publication bias,
p287
aVif small negative trials have gone missing in action,
p288
aVyou can see it on one of these graphs.
p289
aVSo you see here that the small negative trials
p290
aVthat should be on the bottom left have disappeared.
p291
aVThis is a graph demonstrating the presence of publication bias
p292
aVin studies of publication bias.
p293
aVAnd I think that's the funniest epidemiology joke you will ever hear.
p294
aa(lp295
V(Laughter)
p296
aa(lp297
VThat's how you can prove it statistically.
p298
aVBut what about stories?
p299
aVWell, they're heinous, they really are.
p300
aVThis is a drug called reboxetine.
p301
aVThis is a drug which I, myself, have prescribed to patients.
p302
aVAnd I'm a very nerdy doctor.
p303
aVI hope I go out of my way
p304
aVto try and read and understand all the literature.
p305
aVI read the trials on this.
p306
aVThey were all positive, all well-conducted.
p307
aVI found no flaw.
p308
aVUnfortunately, it turned out, that many of these trials were withheld.
p309
aVIn fact, 76 percent of all of the trials that were done on this drug
p310
aVwere withheld from doctors and patients.
p311
aVNow if you think about it,
p312
aVif I tossed a coin a hundred times,
p313
aVand I'm allowed to withhold from you the answers half the times,
p314
aVthen I can convince you that I have a coin with two heads.
p315
aVIf we remove half of the data,
p316
aVwe can never know what the true effect size of these medicines is.
p317
aa(lp318
VAnd this is not an isolated story.
p319
aVAround half of all of the trial data on antidepressants has been withheld,
p320
aVbut it goes way beyond that.
p321
aVThe Nordic Cochrane Group were trying to get ahold of the data on that
p322
aVto bring it all together.
p323
aVThe Cochrane Groups are an international nonprofit collaboration
p324
aVthat produce systematic reviews
p325
aVof all of the data that has ever been shown.
p326
aVAnd they need to have access to all of the trial data.
p327
aVBut the companies withheld that data from them.
p328
aVSo did the European Medicines Agency \u2014
p329
aVfor three years.
p330
aa(lp331
VThis is a problem that is currently lacking a solution.
p332
aVAnd to show how big it goes, this is a drug called Tamiflu,
p333
aVwhich governments around the world
p334
aVhave spent billions and billions of dollars on.
p335
aVAnd they spend that money on the promise that this is a drug
p336
aVwhich will reduce the rate of complications with flu.
p337
aVWe already have the data
p338
aVshowing it reduces the duration of your flu by a few hours.
p339
aVBut I don't care about that, governments don't care.
p340
aVI'm sorry if you have the flu, I know it's horrible,
p341
aVbut we're not going to spend billions of dollars
p342
aVtrying to reduce the duration of your flu symptoms by half a day.
p343
aVWe prescribe these drugs.
p344
aVWe stockpile them for emergencies
p345
aVon the understanding they'll reduce the number of complications,
p346
aVwhich means pneumonia and death.
p347
aVThe infectious diseases Cochrane Group, which are based in Italy,
p348
aVhas been trying to get the full data in a usable form
p349
aVout of the drug companies,
p350
aVso they can make a full decision
p351
aVabout whether this drug is effective or not,
p352
aVand they've not been able to get that information.
p353
aVThis is undoubtedly the single biggest ethical problem
p354
aVfacing medicine today.
p355
aVWe cannot make decisions in the absence of all of the information.
p356
aa(lp357
VSo it's a little bit difficult from there
p358
aVto spin in some kind of positive conclusion.
p359
aVBut I would say this:
p360
aVI think that sunlight
p361
aVis the best disinfectant.
p362
aVAll of these things are happening in plain sight,
p363
aVand they're all protected by a force field of tediousness.
p364
aVAnd I think, with all of the problems in science,
p365
aVone of the best things that we can do
p366
aVis to lift up the lid, finger around at the mechanics
p367
aVand peer in.
p368
