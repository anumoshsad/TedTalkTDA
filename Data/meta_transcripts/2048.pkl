VI'd like to introduce you to an organism:
p4
aVa slime mold, Physarum polycephalum.
p5
aVIt's a mold with an identity crisis, because it's not a mold,
p6
aVso let's get that straight to start with.
p7
aVIt is one of 700 known slime molds
p8
aVbelonging to the kingdom of the amoeba.
p9
aVIt is a single-celled organism, a cell,
p10
aVthat joins together with other cells
p11
aVto form a mass super-cell
p12
aVto maximize its resources.
p13
aVSo within a slime mold you might find thousands
p14
aVor millions of nuclei,
p15
aVall sharing a cell wall,
p16
aVall operating as one entity.
p17
aVIn its natural habitat,
p18
aVyou might find the slime mold foraging in woodlands,
p19
aVeating rotting vegetation,
p20
aVbut you might equally find it
p21
aVin research laboratories,
p22
aVclassrooms, and even artists' studios.
p23
aa(lp24
VI first came across the slime mold about five years ago.
p25
aVA microbiologist friend of mine
p26
aVgave me a petri dish with a little yellow blob in it
p27
aVand told me to go home and play with it.
p28
aVThe only instructions I was given,
p29
aVthat it likes it dark and damp
p30
aVand its favorite food is porridge oats.
p31
aVI'm an artist who's worked for many years
p32
aVwith biology, with scientific processes,
p33
aVso living material is not uncommon for me.
p34
aVI've worked with plants, bacteria,
p35
aVcuttlefish, fruit flies.
p36
aVSo I was keen to get my new collaborator home
p37
aVto see what it could do.
p38
aVSo I took it home and I watched.
p39
aVI fed it a varied diet.
p40
aVI observed as it networked.
p41
aVIt formed a connection between food sources.
p42
aVI watched it leave a trail behind it,
p43
aVindicating where it had been.
p44
aVAnd I noticed that when it was fed up with one petri dish,
p45
aVit would escape and find a better home.
p46
aa(lp47
VI captured my observations
p48
aVthrough time-lapse photography.
p49
aVSlime mold grows at about one centimeter an hour,
p50
aVso it's not really ideal for live viewing
p51
aVunless there's some form of really extreme meditation,
p52
aVbut through the time lapse,
p53
aVI could observe some really interesting behaviors.
p54
aVFor instance, having fed on a nice pile of oats,
p55
aVthe slime mold goes off to explore new territories
p56
aVin different directions simultaneously.
p57
aVWhen it meets itself,
p58
aVit knows it's already there,
p59
aVit recognizes it's there,
p60
aVand instead retreats back
p61
aVand grows in other directions.
p62
aVI was quite impressed by this feat,
p63
aVat how what was essentially just a bag of cellular slime
p64
aVcould somehow map its territory,
p65
aVknow itself, and move with seeming intention.
p66
aa(lp67
VI found countless scientific studies,
p68
aVresearch papers, journal articles,
p69
aVall citing incredible work with this one organism,
p70
aVand I'm going to share a few of those with you.
p71
aVFor example, a team in Hokkaido University in Japan
p72
aVfilled a maze with slime mold.
p73
aVIt joined together and formed a mass cell.
p74
aVThey introduced food at two points,
p75
aVoats of course,
p76
aVand it formed a connection
p77
aVbetween the food.
p78
aVIt retracted from empty areas and dead ends.
p79
aVThere are four possible routes through this maze,
p80
aVyet time and time again,
p81
aVthe slime mold established the shortest
p82
aVand the most efficient route.
p83
aVQuite clever.
p84
aVThe conclusion from their experiment
p85
aVwas that the slime mold had a primitive form of intelligence.
p86
aVAnother study exposed cold air at regular intervals to the slime mold.
p87
aVIt didn't like it. It doesn't like it cold.
p88
aVIt doesn't like it dry.
p89
aVThey did this at repeat intervals,
p90
aVand each time, the slime mold
p91
aVslowed down its growth in response.
p92
aVHowever, at the next interval,
p93
aVthe researchers didn't put the cold air on,
p94
aVyet the slime mold slowed down in anticipation
p95
aVof it happening.
p96
aVIt somehow knew that it was about the time
p97
aVfor the cold air that it didn't like.
p98
aVThe conclusion from their experiment
p99
aVwas that the slime mold was able to learn.
p100
aVA third experiment:
p101
aVthe slime mold was invited
p102
aVto explore a territory covered in oats.
p103
aVIt fans out in a branching pattern.
p104
aVAs it goes, each food node it finds,
p105
aVit forms a network, a connection to,
p106
aVand keeps foraging.
p107
aVAfter 26 hours, it established
p108
aVquite a firm network
p109
aVbetween the different oats.
p110
aVNow there's nothing remarkable in this
p111
aVuntil you learn that the center oat that it started from
p112
aVrepresents the city of Tokyo,
p113
aVand the surrounding oats are suburban railway stations.
p114
aVThe slime mold had replicated
p115
aVthe Tokyo transport network
p116
aV\u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p117
aVa complex system developed over time
p118
aVby community dwellings, civil engineering, urban planning.
p119
aVWhat had taken us well over 100 years
p120
aVtook the slime mold just over a day.
p121
aVThe conclusion from their experiment
p122
aVwas that the slime mold can form efficient networks
p123
aVand solve the traveling salesman problem.
p124
aa(lp125
VIt is a biological computer.
p126
aVAs such, it has been mathematically modeled,
p127
aValgorithmically analyzed.
p128
aVIt's been sonified, replicated, simulated.
p129
aVWorld over, teams of researchers
p130
aVare decoding its biological principles
p131
aVto understand its computational rules
p132
aVand applying that learning to the fields of electronics,
p133
aVprogramming and robotics.
p134
aa(lp135
VSo the question is,
p136
aVhow does this thing work?
p137
aVIt doesn't have a central nervous system.
p138
aVIt doesn't have a brain,
p139
aVyet it can perform behaviors
p140
aVthat we associate with brain function.
p141
aVIt can learn, it can remember,
p142
aVit can solve problems, it can make decisions.
p143
aVSo where does that intelligence lie?
p144
aVSo this is a microscopy, a video I shot,
p145
aVand it's about 100 times magnification,
p146
aVsped up about 20 times,
p147
aVand inside the slime mold,
p148
aVthere is a rhythmic pulsing flow,
p149
aVa vein-like structure carrying
p150
aVcellular material, nutrients and chemical information
p151
aVthrough the cell,
p152
aVstreaming first in one direction and then back in another.
p153
aVAnd it is this continuous, synchronous oscillation
p154
aVwithin the cell that allows it to form
p155
aVquite a complex understanding of its environment,
p156
aVbut without any large-scale control center.
p157
aVThis is where its intelligence lies.
p158
aa(lp159
VSo it's not just academic researchers
p160
aVin universities that are interested in this organism.
p161
aVA few years ago, I set up SliMoCo,
p162
aVthe Slime Mould Collective.
p163
aVIt's an online, open, democratic network
p164
aVfor slime mold researchers and enthusiasts
p165
aVto share knowledge and experimentation
p166
aVacross disciplinary divides
p167
aVand across academic divides.
p168
aVThe Slime Mould Collective membership is self-selecting.
p169
aVPeople have found the collective
p170
aVas the slime mold finds the oats.
p171
aVAnd it comprises of scientists
p172
aVand computer scientists and researchers
p173
aVbut also artists like me,
p174
aVarchitects, designers, writers, activists, you name it.
p175
aVIt's a very interesting, eclectic membership.
p176
aVJust a few examples:
p177
aVan artist who paints with fluorescent Physarum;
p178
aVa collaborative team
p179
aVwho are combining biological and electronic design
p180
aVwith 3D printing technologies in a workshop;
p181
aVanother artist who is using the slime mold
p182
aVas a way of engaging a community
p183
aVto map their area.
p184
aVHere, the slime mold is being used directly
p185
aVas a biological tool, but metaphorically
p186
aVas a symbol for ways of talking
p187
aVabout social cohesion, communication
p188
aVand cooperation.
p189
aVOther public engagement activities,
p190
aVI run lots of slime mold workshops,
p191
aVa creative way of engaging with the organism.
p192
aVSo people are invited to come and learn
p193
aVabout what amazing things it can do,
p194
aVand they design their own petri dish experiment,
p195
aVan environment for the slime mold to navigate
p196
aVso they can test its properties.
p197
aVEverybody takes home a new pet
p198
aVand is invited to post their results
p199
aVon the Slime Mould Collective.
p200
aVAnd the collective has enabled me
p201
aVto form collaborations
p202
aVwith a whole array of interesting people.
p203
aVI've been working with filmmakers
p204
aVon a feature-length slime mold documentary,
p205
aVand I stress feature-length,
p206
aVwhich is in the final stages of edit
p207
aVand will be hitting your cinema screens very soon.
p208
aV(Laughter)
p209
aa(lp210
VIt's also enabled me to conduct what I think is
p211
aVthe world's first human slime mold experiment.
p212
aVThis is part of an exhibition in Rotterdam last year.
p213
aVWe invited people to become slime mold for half an hour.
p214
aVSo we essentially tied people together
p215
aVso they were a giant cell,
p216
aVand invited them to follow slime mold rules.
p217
aVYou have to communicate through oscillations,
p218
aVno speaking.
p219
aVYou have to operate as one entity, one mass cell,
p220
aVno egos,
p221
aVand the motivation for moving
p222
aVand then exploring the environment
p223
aVis in search of food.
p224
aVSo a chaotic shuffle ensued as this bunch of strangers
p225
aVtied together with yellow ropes wearing "Being Slime Mold" t-shirts
p226
aVwandered through the museum park.
p227
aVWhen they met trees, they had to reshape
p228
aVtheir connections and reform as a mass cell
p229
aVthrough not speaking.
p230
aVThis is a ludicrous experiment in many, many ways.
p231
aVThis isn't hypothesis-driven.
p232
aVWe're not trying to prove, demonstrate anything.
p233
aVBut what it did provide us was a way
p234
aVof engaging a broad section of the public
p235
aVwith ideas of intelligence, agency, autonomy,
p236
aVand provide a playful platform
p237
aVfor discussions about
p238
aVthe things that ensued.
p239
aVOne of the most exciting things
p240
aVabout this experiment
p241
aVwas the conversation that happened afterwards.
p242
aVAn entirely spontaneous symposium happened in the park.
p243
aVPeople talked about the human psychology,
p244
aVof how difficult it was to let go
p245
aVof their individual personalities and egos.
p246
aVOther people talked about bacterial communication.
p247
aVEach person brought in their own
p248
aVindividual interpretation,
p249
aVand our conclusion from this experiment was that
p250
aVthe people of Rotterdam were highly cooperative,
p251
aVespecially when given beer.
p252
aVWe didn't just give them oats.
p253
aVWe gave them beer as well.
p254
aa(lp255
VBut they weren't as efficient as the slime mold,
p256
aVand the slime mold, for me,
p257
aVis a fascinating subject matter.
p258
aVIt's biologically fascinating,
p259
aVit's computationally interesting,
p260
aVbut it's also a symbol,
p261
aVa way of engaging with ideas of community,
p262
aVcollective behavior, cooperation.
p263
aVA lot of my work draws on the scientific research,
p264
aVso this pays homage to the maze experiment
p265
aVbut in a different way.
p266
aVAnd the slime mold is also my working material.
p267
aVIt's a coproducer of photographs, prints, animations,
p268
aVparticipatory events.
p269
aVWhilst the slime mold doesn't choose
p270
aVto work with me, exactly,
p271
aVit is a collaboration of sorts.
p272
aVI can predict certain behaviors
p273
aVby understanding how it operates,
p274
aVbut I can't control it.
p275
aVThe slime mold has the final say
p276
aVin the creative process.
p277
aVAnd after all, it has its own internal aesthetics.
p278
aVThese branching patterns that we see
p279
aVwe see across all forms, scales of nature,
p280
aVfrom river deltas to lightning strikes,
p281
aVfrom our own blood vessels to neural networks.
p282
aVThere's clearly significant rules at play
p283
aVin this simple yet complex organism,
p284
aVand no matter what our disciplinary perspective or our mode of inquiry,
p285
aVthere's a great deal that we can learn
p286
aVfrom observing and engaging
p287
aVwith this beautiful, brainless blob.
p288
aa(lp289
VI give you Physarum polycephalum.
