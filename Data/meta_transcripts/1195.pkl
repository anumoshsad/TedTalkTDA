VIt is a dream of mankind to fly like a bird.
p4
aVBirds are very agile.
p5
aVThey fly, not with rotating components,
p6
aVso they fly only by flapping their wings.
p7
aVSo we looked at the birds,
p8
aVand we tried to make a model that is powerful, ultralight,
p9
aVand it must have excellent aerodynamic qualities
p10
aVthat would fly by its own and only by flapping its wings.
p11
aa(lp12
VSo what would be better than to use the herring gull, in its freedom,
p13
aVcircling and swooping over the sea,
p14
aVand to use this as a role model?
p15
aVSo we bring a team together.
p16
aVThere are generalists and also specialists in the field of aerodynamics,
p17
aVin the field of building gliders.
p18
aVAnd the task was to build an ultralight indoor-flying model
p19
aVthat is able to fly over your heads.
p20
aVSo be careful later on.
p21
aa(lp22
V(Laughter)
p23
aa(lp24
VAnd this was one issue:
p25
aVto build it that lightweight
p26
aVthat no one would be hurt if it fell down.
p27
aa(lp28
VSo why do we do all this?
p29
aVWe are a company in the field of automation,
p30
aVand we'd like to do very lightweight structures
p31
aVbecause that's energy efficient,
p32
aVand we'd like to learn more about pneumatics and air flow phenomena.
p33
aa(lp34
VSo I now would like you to put your seat belts on
p35
aVand put your hats on.
p36
aVSo maybe we'll try it once \u2014
p37
aVto fly a SmartBird.
p38
aa(lp39
VThank you.
p40
aa(lp41
V(Applause)
p42
aa(lp43
V(Cheers)
p44
aa(lp45
V(Applause)
p46
aa(lp47
V(Applause ends)
p48
aa(lp49
V(Applause)
p50
aa(lp51
VSo we can now look at the SmartBird.
p52
aVSo here is one without a skin.
p53
aVWe have a wingspan of about two meters.
p54
aVThe length is one meter and six,
p55
aVand the weight is only 450 grams.
p56
aVAnd it is all out of carbon fiber.
p57
aVIn the middle we have a motor,
p58
aVand we also have a gear in it,
p59
aVand we use the gear to transfer the circulation of the motor.
p60
aVSo within the motor, we have three Hall sensors,
p61
aVso we know exactly where the wing is.
p62
aVAnd if we now beat up and down \u2014
p63
aa(lp64
V(Mechanical sounds)
p65
aa(lp66
VWe have the possibility to fly like a bird.
p67
aVSo if you go down, you have the large area of propulsion,
p68
aVand if you go up,
p69
aVthe wings are not that large,
p70
aVand it is easier to get up.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo, the next thing we did,
p73
aVor the challenges we did,
p74
aVwas to coordinate this movement.
p75
aVWe have to turn it, go up and go down.
p76
aVWe have a split wing.
p77
aVWith the split wing,
p78
aVwe get the lift at the upper wing,
p79
aVand we get the propulsion at the lower wing.
p80
aVAlso, we see how we measure the aerodynamic efficiency.
p81
aVWe had knowledge about the electromechanical efficiency
p82
aVand then we can calculate the aerodynamic efficiency.
p83
aVSo therefore, it rises up from passive torsion to active torsion,
p84
aVfrom 30 percent up to 80 percent.
p85
aa(lp86
VNext thing we have to do,
p87
aVwe have to control and regulate the whole structure.
p88
aVOnly if you control and regulate it,
p89
aVyou will get that aerodynamic efficiency.
p90
aVSo the overall consumption of energy
p91
aVis about 25 watts at takeoff
p92
aVand 16 to 18 watts in flight.
p93
aa(lp94
VThank you.
p95
aa(lp96
V(Applause)
p97
aa(lp98
VBruno Giussani: Markus, we should fly it once more.
p99
aa(lp100
VMarkus Fischer: Yeah, sure.
p101
aa(lp102
V(Audience) Yeah!
p103
aa(lp104
