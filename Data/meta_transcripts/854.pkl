VI'm going to tell you two things today:
p4
aVOne is what we have lost,
p5
aVand two, a way to bring it back.
p6
aVAnd let me start with this.
p7
aVThis is my baseline:
p8
aVThis is the Mediterranean coast
p9
aVwith no fish, bare rock
p10
aVand lots of sea urchins that like to eat the algae.
p11
aVSomething like this is what I first saw
p12
aVwhen I jumped in the water for the first time
p13
aVin the Mediterranean coast off Spain.
p14
aVNow, if an alien came to earth \u2014
p15
aVlet's call him Joe \u2014
p16
aVwhat would Joe see?
p17
aVIf Joe jumped in a coral reef,
p18
aVthere are many things the alien could see.
p19
aVVery unlikely, Joe would jump
p20
aVon a pristine coral reef,
p21
aVa virgin coral reef with lots of coral, sharks, crocodiles,
p22
aVmanatees, groupers,
p23
aVturtles, etc.
p24
aVSo, probably, what Joe would see
p25
aVwould be in this part, in the greenish part of the picture.
p26
aVHere we have the extreme with dead corals,
p27
aVmicrobial soup and jellyfish.
p28
aVAnd where the diver is,
p29
aVthis is probably where most of the reefs of the world are now,
p30
aVwith very few corals, algae overgrowing the corals,
p31
aVlots of bacteria,
p32
aVand where the large animals are gone.
p33
aVAnd this is what most marine scientists have seen too.
p34
aVThis is their baseline. This is what they think is natural
p35
aVbecause we started modern science
p36
aVwith scuba diving long after
p37
aVwe started degrading marine ecosystems.
p38
aa(lp39
VSo I'm going to get us all on a time machine,
p40
aVand we're going to the left; we're going to go back to the past
p41
aVto see what the ocean was like.
p42
aVAnd let's start with this time machine, the Line Islands,
p43
aVwhere we have conducted a series
p44
aVof National Geographic expeditions.
p45
aVThis sea is an archipelago belonging to Kiribati
p46
aVthat spans across the equator
p47
aVand it has several uninhabited,
p48
aVunfished, pristine islands
p49
aVand a few inhabited islands.
p50
aVSo let's start with the first one: Christmas Island, over 5,000 people.
p51
aVMost of the reefs are dead,
p52
aVmost of the corals are dead \u2014 overgrown by algae \u2014
p53
aVand most of the fish are smaller than
p54
aVthe pencils we use to count them.
p55
aVWe did 250 hours of diving here
p56
aVin 2005.
p57
aVWe didn't see a single shark.
p58
aVThis is the place that Captain Cook discovered in 1777
p59
aVand he described a huge abundance of sharks
p60
aVbiting the rudders and the oars of their small boats
p61
aVwhile they were going ashore.
p62
aa(lp63
VLet's move the dial a little bit to the past.
p64
aVFanning Island, 2,500 people.
p65
aVThe corals are doing better here. Lots of small fish.
p66
aVThis is what many divers would consider paradise.
p67
aVThis is where you can see most
p68
aVof the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary.
p69
aVAnd many people think this is really, really beautiful,
p70
aVif this is your baseline.
p71
aVIf we go back to a place
p72
aVlike Palmyra Atoll,
p73
aVwhere I was with Jeremy Jackson a few years ago,
p74
aVthe corals are doing better and there are sharks.
p75
aVYou can see sharks in every single dive.
p76
aVAnd this is something that is very unusual in today's coral reefs.
p77
aVBut then, if we shift the dial
p78
aV200, 500 years back,
p79
aVthen we get to the places where the corals
p80
aVare absolutely healthy and gorgeous,
p81
aVforming spectacular structures,
p82
aVand where the predators
p83
aVare the most conspicuous thing,
p84
aVwhere you see between 25 and 50 sharks per dive.
p85
aa(lp86
VWhat have we learned from these places?
p87
aVThis is what we thought was natural.
p88
aVThis is what we call the biomass pyramid.
p89
aVIf we get all of the fish of a coral reef together and weigh them,
p90
aVthis is what we would expect.
p91
aVMost of the biomass is low on the food chain, the herbivores,
p92
aVthe parrotfish, the surgeonfish that eat the algae.
p93
aVThen the plankton feeders, these little damselfish,
p94
aVthe little animals floating in the water.
p95
aVAnd then we have a lower biomass of carnivores,
p96
aVand a lower biomass of top head,
p97
aVor the sharks, the large snappers, the large groupers.
p98
aVBut this is a consequence.
p99
aVThis view of the world is a consequence
p100
aVof having studied degraded reefs.
p101
aa(lp102
VWhen we went to pristine reefs,
p103
aVwe realized that the natural world
p104
aVwas upside down;
p105
aVthis pyramid was inverted.
p106
aVThe top head does account for most of the biomass,
p107
aVin some places up to 85 percent,
p108
aVlike Kingman Reef, which is now protected.
p109
aVThe good news is that, in addition to having more predators,
p110
aVthere's more of everything.
p111
aVThe size of these boxes is bigger.
p112
aVWe have more sharks, more biomass of snappers,
p113
aVmore biomass of herbivores, too,
p114
aVlike these parrot fish that are like marine goats.
p115
aVThey clean the reef; everything that grows enough to be seen,
p116
aVthey eat, and they keep the reef clean
p117
aVand allow the corals to replenish.
p118
aVNot only do these places \u2014
p119
aVthese ancient, pristine places \u2014 have lots of fish,
p120
aVbut they also have other important components
p121
aVof the ecosystem like the giant clams;
p122
aVpavements of giant clams in the lagoons,
p123
aVup to 20, 25 per square meter.
p124
aVThese have disappeared from every inhabited reef in the world,
p125
aVand they filter the water;
p126
aVthey keep the water clean from
p127
aVmicrobes and pathogens.
p128
aa(lp129
VBut still, now we have global warming.
p130
aVIf we don't have fishing because these reefs are protected by law
p131
aVor their remoteness, this is great.
p132
aVBut the water gets warmer for too long
p133
aVand the corals die.
p134
aVSo how are these fish,
p135
aVthese predators going to help?
p136
aVWell, what we have seen is that
p137
aVin this particular area
p138
aVduring El Nino, year '97, '98,
p139
aVthe water was too warm for too long,
p140
aVand many corals bleached
p141
aVand many died.
p142
aVIn Christmas, where the food web is really trimmed down,
p143
aVwhere the large animals are gone,
p144
aVthe corals have not recovered.
p145
aVIn Fanning Island, the corals are not recovered.
p146
aVBut you see here
p147
aVa big table coral that died and collapsed.
p148
aVAnd the fish have grazed the algae,
p149
aVso the turf of algae is a little lower.
p150
aVThen you go to Palmyra Atoll
p151
aVthat has more biomass of herbivores,
p152
aVand the dead corals are clean,
p153
aVand the corals are coming back.
p154
aVAnd when you go to the pristine side,
p155
aVdid this ever bleach?
p156
aVThese places bleached too, but they recovered faster.
p157
aVThe more intact, the more complete,
p158
aV[and] the more complex your food web,
p159
aVthe higher the resilience, [and] the more likely
p160
aVthat the system is going to recover
p161
aVfrom the short-term impacts of warming events.
p162
aVAnd that's good news, so we need to recover that structure.
p163
aVWe need to make sure that all of the pieces of the ecosystem are there
p164
aVso the ecosystem can adapt
p165
aVto the effects of global warming.
p166
aa(lp167
VSo if we have to reset the baseline,
p168
aVif we have to push the ecosystem back to the left,
p169
aVhow can we do it?
p170
aVWell, there are several ways.
p171
aVOne very clear way is the marine protected areas,
p172
aVespecially no-take reserves
p173
aVthat we set aside
p174
aVto allow for the recovery for marine life.
p175
aVAnd let me go back to that image
p176
aVof the Mediterranean.
p177
aVThis was my baseline. This is what I saw when I was a kid.
p178
aVAnd at the same time I was watching
p179
aVJacques Cousteau's shows on TV,
p180
aVwith all this richness and abundance and diversity.
p181
aVAnd I thought that this richness
p182
aVbelonged to tropical seas,
p183
aVand that the Mediterranean was a naturally poor sea.
p184
aVBut, little did I know,
p185
aVuntil I jumped for the first time in a marine reserve.
p186
aVAnd this is what I saw, lots of fish.
p187
aa(lp188
VAfter a few years, between five and seven years,
p189
aVfish come back, they eat the urchins,
p190
aVand then the algae grow again.
p191
aVSo you have this little algal forest,
p192
aVand in the size of a laptop
p193
aVyou can find more than 100 species of algae,
p194
aVmostly microscopic fit
p195
aVhundreds of species of little animals
p196
aVthat then feed the fish,
p197
aVso that the system recovers.
p198
aVAnd this particular place, the Medes Islands Marine Reserve,
p199
aVis only 94 hectares,
p200
aVand it brings 6 million euros to the local economy,
p201
aV20 times more than fishing,
p202
aVand it represents 88 percent
p203
aVof all the tourist revenue.
p204
aVSo these places not only help the ecosystem
p205
aVbut also help the people
p206
aVwho can benefit from the ecosystem.
p207
aa(lp208
VSo let me just give you a summary
p209
aVof what no-take reserves do.
p210
aVThese places, when we protect them,
p211
aVif we compare them to unprotected areas nearby, this is what happens.
p212
aVThe number of species increases 21 percent;
p213
aVso if you have 1,000 species
p214
aVyou would expect 200 more in a marine reserve.
p215
aVThis is very substantial.
p216
aVThe size of organisms increases a third,
p217
aVso your fish are now this big.
p218
aVThe abundance, how many fish you have per square meter,
p219
aVincreases almost 170 percent.
p220
aVAnd the biomass \u2014 this is the most spectacular change \u2014
p221
aV4.5 times greater biomass
p222
aVon average, just after five to seven years.
p223
aVIn some places up to 10 times
p224
aVlarger biomass inside the reserves.
p225
aa(lp226
VSo we have all these things
p227
aVinside the reserve that grow, and what do they do?
p228
aVThey reproduce. That's population biology 101.
p229
aVIf you don't kill the fish, they take a longer time to die,
p230
aVthey grow larger and they reproduce a lot.
p231
aVAnd same thing for invertebrates. This is the example.
p232
aVThese are egg cases
p233
aVlaid by a snail off the coast of Chile,
p234
aVand this is how many eggs they lay on the bottom.
p235
aVOutside the reserve,
p236
aVyou cannot even detect this.
p237
aVOne point three million eggs per square meter
p238
aVinside the marine reserve where these snails are very abundant.
p239
aVSo these organisms reproduce,
p240
aVthe little larvae juveniles spill over,
p241
aVthey all spill over,
p242
aVand then people can benefit from them outside too.
p243
aVThis is in the Bahamas: Nassau grouper.
p244
aVHuge abundance of groupers inside the reserve,
p245
aVand the closer you get to the reserve,
p246
aVthe more fish you have.
p247
aVSo the fishermen are catching more.
p248
aVYou can see where the limits of the reserve are
p249
aVbecause you see the boats lined up.
p250
aVSo there is spill over;
p251
aVthere are benefits beyond the boundaries of these reserves
p252
aVthat help people around them,
p253
aVwhile at the same time
p254
aVthe reserve is protecting
p255
aVthe entire habitat. It is building resilience.
p256
aa(lp257
VSo what we have now \u2014
p258
aVor a world without reserves \u2014
p259
aVis like a debit account
p260
aVwhere we withdraw all the time
p261
aVand we never make any deposit.
p262
aVReserves are like savings accounts.
p263
aVWe have this principal that we don't touch;
p264
aVthat produces returns,
p265
aVsocial, economic and ecological.
p266
aVAnd if we think about the increase of biomass inside the reserves,
p267
aVthis is like compound interest.
p268
aVTwo examples, again,
p269
aVof how these reserves can benefit people.
p270
aVThis is how much fishermen get
p271
aVeveryday in Kenya, fishing
p272
aVover a series of years,
p273
aVin a place where
p274
aVthere is no protection; it's a free-for-all.
p275
aVOnce the most degrading fishing gear,
p276
aVseine nets, were removed,
p277
aVthe fishermen were catching more.
p278
aVIf you fish less, you're actually catching more.
p279
aVBut if we add the no-take reserve on top of that,
p280
aVthe fishermen are still making more money
p281
aVby fishing less around an area that is protected.
p282
aa(lp283
VAnother example:
p284
aVNassau groupers in Belize in the Mesoamerican Reef.
p285
aVThis is grouper sex,
p286
aVand the groupers aggregate around the full moons
p287
aVof December and January for a week.
p288
aVThey used to aggregate up to the
p289
aVtens of thousands, 30,000 groupers about this big
p290
aVin one hectare, in one aggregation.
p291
aVFishermen knew about these things; they caught them, and they depleted them.
p292
aVWhen I went there for the first time in 2000,
p293
aVthere were only 3,000 groupers left.
p294
aVAnd the fishermen were authorized to catch 30 percent
p295
aVof the entire spawning population every year.
p296
aVSo we did a simple analysis,
p297
aVand it doesn't take rocket science
p298
aVto figure out that, if you take 30 percent every year,
p299
aVyour fishery is going to collapse very quickly.
p300
aVAnd with the fishery, the entire reproductive ability
p301
aVof the species goes extinct.
p302
aVIt happened in many places around the Caribbean.
p303
aVAnd they would make 4,000 dollars per year,
p304
aVtotal, for the entire fishery,
p305
aVseveral fishing boats.
p306
aVNow, if you do an economic analysis
p307
aVand project what would happen
p308
aVif the fish were not cut,
p309
aVif we brought just 20 divers
p310
aVone month per year,
p311
aVthe revenue would be more than 20 times higher
p312
aVand that would be sustainable over time.
p313
aa(lp314
VSo how much of this do we have?
p315
aVIf this is so good, if this is such a no-brainer, how much of this do we have?
p316
aVAnd you already heard that
p317
aVless than one percent of the ocean's protected.
p318
aVWe're getting closer to one percent now,
p319
aVthanks to the protections of the Chagos Archipelago,
p320
aVand only a fraction of this is fully protected from fishing.
p321
aVScientific studies recommend that at least 20 percent
p322
aVof the ocean should be protected.
p323
aVThe estimated range is between 20 and 50 percent
p324
aVfor a series of goals of biodiversity
p325
aVand fishery enhancement and resilience.
p326
aa(lp327
VNow, is this possible? People would ask: How much would that cost?
p328
aVWell, let's think about
p329
aVhow much we are paying now
p330
aVto subsidize fishing:
p331
aV35 billion dollars per year.
p332
aVMany of these subsidies go to destructive fishing practices.
p333
aVWell, there are a couple estimates
p334
aVof how much it would cost to create
p335
aVa network of protected areas
p336
aVcovering 20 percent of the ocean
p337
aVthat would be only a fraction
p338
aVof what we are now paying;
p339
aVthe government hands out to a fishery
p340
aVthat is collapsing.
p341
aVPeople are losing their jobs because the fisheries are collapsing.
p342
aVA creation of a network of reserves
p343
aVwould provide direct employment for more than a million people
p344
aVplus all the secondary jobs and all the secondary benefits.
p345
aa(lp346
VSo how can we do that?
p347
aVIf it's so clear that these savings accounts
p348
aVare good for the environment and for people,
p349
aVwhy don't we have 20, 50 percent of the ocean?
p350
aVAnd how can we reach that goal?
p351
aVWell, there are two ways of getting there.
p352
aVThe trivial solution is to create really large protected areas
p353
aVlike the Chagos Archipelago.
p354
aVThe problem is that we can create these large reserves
p355
aVonly in places where there are no people, where there is no social conflict,
p356
aVwhere the political cost is really low
p357
aVand the economic cost is also low.
p358
aVAnd a few of us, a few organizations in this room and elsewhere
p359
aVare working on this.
p360
aa(lp361
VBut what about the rest of the coast of the world,
p362
aVwhere people live and make a living out of fishing?
p363
aVWell, there are three main reasons why
p364
aVwe don't have tens of thousands of small reserves:
p365
aVThe first one is that people have no idea
p366
aVwhat marine reserves do,
p367
aVand fishermen tend to be really, really defensive
p368
aVwhen it comes to regulating or closing
p369
aVan area, even if it's small.
p370
aVSecond, the governance is not right
p371
aVbecause most coastal communities around the world
p372
aVdon't have the authority
p373
aVto monitor the resources to create the reserve and enforce it.
p374
aVIt's a top down hierarchical structure
p375
aVwhere people wait for
p376
aVgovernment agents to come
p377
aVand this is not effective. And the government doesn't have enough resources.
p378
aa(lp379
VWhich takes us to the third reason,
p380
aVwhy we don't have many more reserves,
p381
aVis that the funding models have been wrong.
p382
aVNGOs and governments
p383
aVspend a lot of time and energy and resources
p384
aVin a few small areas, usually.
p385
aVSo marine conservation and coastal protection
p386
aVhas become a sink for government or philanthropic money,
p387
aVand this is not sustainable.
p388
aVSo the solutions are just
p389
aVfixing these three issues.
p390
aVFirst, we need to develop a global awareness campaign
p391
aVto inspire local communities and governments
p392
aVto create no-take reserves
p393
aVthat are better than what we have now.
p394
aVIt's the savings accounts
p395
aVversus the debit accounts with no deposits.
p396
aVSecond, we need to redesign our governance
p397
aVso conservation efforts can be decentralized,
p398
aVso conservation efforts don't depend on
p399
aVwork from NGOs
p400
aVor from government agencies
p401
aVand can be created by the local communities,
p402
aVlike it happens in the Philippines and a few other places.
p403
aVAnd third, and very important,
p404
aVwe need to develop new business models.
p405
aVThe philanthropy sink as the only way to create reserves
p406
aVis not sustainable.
p407
aVWe really need to develop models, business models,
p408
aVwhere coastal conservation
p409
aVis an investment,
p410
aVbecause we already know
p411
aVthat these marine reserves provide
p412
aVsocial, ecological and economic benefits.
p413
aa(lp414
VAnd I'd like to finish with one thought,
p415
aVwhich is that no one
p416
aVorganization alone
p417
aVis going to save the ocean.
p418
aVThere has been a lot of competition in the past,
p419
aVand we need to develop
p420
aVa new model of partnership,
p421
aVtruly collaborative,
p422
aVwhere we are looking for complementing,
p423
aVnot substituting.
p424
aVThe stakes are just too high
p425
aVto continue the way we are going.
p426
aVSo let's do that. Thank you very much.
p427
aa(lp428
V(Applause)
p429
aa(lp430
VChris Anderson: Thank you Enric.
p431
aa(lp432
VEnric Sala: Thank you.
p433
aa(lp434
VCA: That was a masterful job
p435
aVof pulling things together.
p436
aVFirst of all, your pyramid, your inverted pyramid,
p437
aVshowing 85 percent biomass in the predators,
p438
aVthat seems impossible.
p439
aVHow could 85 percent
p440
aVsurvive on 15 percent?
p441
aa(lp442
VES: Well, imagine that you have two gears
p443
aVof a watch, a big one and a small one.
p444
aVThe big one is moving very slowly, and the small one is moving fast.
p445
aVThat's basically it.
p446
aVThe animals at the lower parts of the food chain,
p447
aVthey reproduce very fast; they grow really fast; they produce millions of eggs.
p448
aVUp there, you have sharks and large fish that live 25, 30 years.
p449
aVThey reproduce very slowly; they have a slow metabolism;
p450
aVand, basically, they just maintain their biomass.
p451
aVSo, basically, the production surplus of these guys down there
p452
aVis enough to maintain this biomass
p453
aVthat is not moving.
p454
aVThey are like capacitors of the system.
p455
aa(lp456
VCA: That's very fascinating.
p457
aVSo, really, our picture of a food pyramid
p458
aVis just \u2014 we have to change that completely.
p459
aa(lp460
VES: At least in the seas.
p461
aVWhat we found in coral reefs is that the inverted pyramid
p462
aVis the equivalent of the Serengeti,
p463
aVwith five lions per wildebeest.
p464
aVAnd on land, this cannot work.
p465
aVBut at least on coral reefs are systems
p466
aVwhere there is a bottom component with structure.
p467
aVWe think this is universal.
p468
aVBut we have started studying pristine reefs
p469
aVonly very recently.
p470
aa(lp471
VCA: So the numbers you presented really are astonishing.
p472
aVYou're saying we're spending 35 billion dollars
p473
aVnow on subsidies.
p474
aVIt would only cost 16 billion to set up
p475
aV20 percent of the ocean as
p476
aVmarine protected areas
p477
aVthat actually give new living choices
p478
aVto the fishermen as well.
p479
aVIf the world was a smarter place,
p480
aVwe could solve this problem for negative 19 billion dollars.
p481
aVWe've got 19 billion to spend on health care or something.
p482
aa(lp483
VES: And then we have the under-performance of fisheries
p484
aVthat is 50 billion dollars.
p485
aVSo again, one of the big solutions is
p486
aVhave the World Trade Organization shifting the subsidies
p487
aVto sustainable practices.
p488
aa(lp489
VCA: Okay, so there's a lot of examples that I'm hearing out there
p490
aVabout ending this subsidies madness.
p491
aVSo thank you for those numbers.
p492
aVThe last one's a personal question.
p493
aVA lot of the experience of people here
p494
aVwho've been in the oceans for a long time
p495
aVhas just been seeing this degradation, the places they saw that were beautiful
p496
aVgetting worse, depressing.
p497
aVTalk to me about the feeling that you must have experienced
p498
aVof going to these pristine areas
p499
aVand seeing things coming back.
p500
aa(lp501
VES: It is a spiritual experience.
p502
aVWe go there to try to understand the ecosystems,
p503
aVto try to measure or count fish and sharks
p504
aVand see how these places are different from the places we know.
p505
aVBut the best feeling
p506
aVis this biophilia that E.O. Wilson talks about,
p507
aVwhere humans have this sense of awe and wonder
p508
aVin front of untamed nature, of raw nature.
p509
aVAnd there, only there,
p510
aVyou really feel that you are part of a larger thing
p511
aVor of a larger global ecosystem.
p512
aVAnd if it were not for these places that show hope,
p513
aVI don't think I could continue doing this job.
p514
aVIt would be just too depressing.
p515
aa(lp516
VCA: Well, Enric, thank you so much for sharing
p517
aVsome of that spiritual experience with us all. Thank you.
p518
aa(lp519
VES: Thank you very much.
