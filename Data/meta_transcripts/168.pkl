VI have 18 minutes to tell you what happened
p4
aVover the past six million years.
p5
aVAll right.
p6
aVWe all have come from a long way,
p7
aVhere in Africa, and converged in this region of Africa,
p8
aVwhich is a place where 90 percent of our evolutionary process took place.
p9
aVAnd I say that not because I am African,
p10
aVbut it's in Africa that you find the earliest evidence
p11
aVfor human ancestors, upright walking traces,
p12
aVeven the first technologies in the form of stone tools.
p13
aVSo we all are Africans, and welcome home.
p14
aVAll right.
p15
aa(lp16
VI'm a paleoanthropologist, and my job is to define
p17
aVman's place in nature and explore what makes us human.
p18
aVAnd today, I will use Selam, the earliest child ever discovered,
p19
aVto tell you a story of all of us.
p20
aVSelam is our most complete skeleton of a three-year-old girl
p21
aVwho lived and died 3.3 million years ago.
p22
aVShe belongs to the species known as Australopithecus afarensis.
p23
aVYou don't need to remember that.
p24
aVThat's the Lucy species, and was found by my research team
p25
aVin December of 2000 in an area called Dikika.
p26
aVIt's in the northeastern part of Ethiopia.
p27
aVAnd Selam means peace in many Ethiopian languages.
p28
aVWe use that name to celebrate peace in the region and in the planet.
p29
aVAnd the fact that it was the cover story of all these famous magazines
p30
aVgives you already an idea of her significance, I think.
p31
aa(lp32
VAfter I was invited by TED, I did some digging,
p33
aVbecause that's what we do, to know about my host.
p34
aVYou don't just jump into an invitation.
p35
aVAnd I learned that the first technology appeared
p36
aVin the form of stone tools, 2.6 million years ago.
p37
aVFirst entertainment comes evidence from flutes that are 35,000 years old.
p38
aVAnd evidence for first design comes 75,000 years old \u2014 beads.
p39
aVAnd you can do the same with your genes and track them back in time.
p40
aVAnd DNA analysis of living humans and chimpanzees
p41
aVteaches us today that we diverged sometime around seven million years ago
p42
aVand that these two species share over 98 percent of the same genetic material.
p43
aVI think knowing this is a very useful context
p44
aVwithin which we can think of our ancestry.
p45
aa(lp46
VHowever, DNA analysis informs us only about
p47
aVthe beginning and the end, telling us nothing
p48
aVabout what happened in the middle.
p49
aVSo, for us, paleoanthropologists, our job is to find the hard evidence,
p50
aVthe fossil evidence, to fill in this gap
p51
aVand see the different stages of development.
p52
aVBecause it's only when you do that, that you can talk about \u2014
p53
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p54
aVit's only when you do that, [that] you can talk about
p55
aVhow we looked like and how we behaved at different times,
p56
aVand how those likes and looks and behaviors changed through time.
p57
aVThat then gives you an access
p58
aVto explore the biological mechanisms
p59
aVand forces that are responsible for this gradual change
p60
aVthat made us what we are today.
p61
aVBut finding the hard evidence is a very complicated endeavor.
p62
aVIt's a systematic and scientific approach,
p63
aVwhich takes you to places that are remote, hot, hostile and often with no access.
p64
aa(lp65
VJust to give you an example, when I went to Dikika,
p66
aVwhere Selam was found, in '99 \u2014 and it's about 500 kilometers
p67
aVfrom Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia.
p68
aVIt took us only seven hours to do the first 470 kilometers of the 500,
p69
aVbut took four, solid hours to do the last only 30 kilometers.
p70
aVWith the help of the locals and using just shovels and picks, I made my way.
p71
aVI was the first person to actually drive a car to the spot.
p72
aVWhen you get there, this is what you see,
p73
aVand it's the vastness of the place which makes you feel helpless and vulnerable.
p74
aVAnd once you make it there, the big question is where to start.
p75
aV(Laughter)
p76
aVAnd you find nothing for years and years.
p77
aa(lp78
VWhen I go to places like this, which are paleontological sites,
p79
aVit's like going to a game park, an extinct game park.
p80
aVBut what you find are not the human remains,
p81
aVsuch as Selam and Lucy, on a day-to-day basis.
p82
aVYou find elephants, rhinos, monkeys, pigs, etc.
p83
aVBut you could ask, how could these large mammals
p84
aVlive in this desert environment?
p85
aVOf course, they cannot, but I'm telling you already
p86
aVthat the environment and the carrying capacity
p87
aVof this region was drastically different from what we have today.
p88
aVA very important environmental lesson could be learned from this.
p89
aVAnyway, once we made it there, then it's a game park, as I said, an extinct game park.
p90
aVAnd our ancestors lived in that game park,
p91
aVbut were just the minorities. They were not as successful
p92
aVand as widespread as the Homo sapiens that we are.
p93
aa(lp94
VTo tell you just an example, an anecdote about their rarity,
p95
aVI was going to this place every year and would do fieldwork here,
p96
aVand the assistants, of course, helped me do the surveys.
p97
aVThey would find a bone and tell me, "Here is what you're looking for."
p98
aVI would say, "No, that's an elephant."
p99
aVAgain, another one, "That's a monkey." "That's a pig," etc.
p100
aVSo one of my assistants, who never went to school, said to me, "Listen, Zeray.
p101
aVYou either don't know what you're looking for,
p102
aVor you're looking in the wrong place," he said.
p103
aV(Laughter)
p104
aVAnd I said, "Why?" "Because there were elephants and lions,
p105
aVand the people were scared and went somewhere else.
p106
aVLet's go somewhere else."
p107
aVWell, he was very tired, and it's really tiring.
p108
aa(lp109
VIt was then, after such hard work and many frustrating years that we found Selam,
p110
aVand you see the face here covered by sandstone.
p111
aVAnd here is actually the spinal column
p112
aVand the whole torso encased in a sandstone block,
p113
aVbecause she was buried by a river.
p114
aVWhat you have here seems to be nothing,
p115
aVbut contains an incredible amount of scientific information
p116
aVthat helps us explore what makes us human.
p117
aVThis is the earliest and most complete juvenile human ancestor
p118
aVever found in the history of paleoanthropology,
p119
aVan amazing piece of our long, long history.
p120
aVThere were these three people and me, and I am taking the pictures,
p121
aVthat's why I am not in.
p122
aa(lp123
VHow would you feel if you were me? You have something extraordinary in your hand,
p124
aVbut you are in the middle of nowhere?
p125
aVThe feeling I had was a deep and quiet happiness and excitement,
p126
aVof course accompanied by a huge sense of responsibility,
p127
aVof making sure everything is safe.
p128
aa(lp129
VHere is a close-up of the fossil, after five years of cleaning,
p130
aVpreparation and description, which was very long,
p131
aVas I had to expose the bones from the sandstone block
p132
aVI just showed you in the previous slide.
p133
aVIt took five years.
p134
aVIn a way, this was like the second birth for the child, after 3.3 million years,
p135
aVbut the labor was very long.
p136
aVAnd here is full scale \u2014 it's a tiny bone.
p137
aVAnd in the middle is the minister of Ethiopian tourism,
p138
aVwho came to visit the National Museum of Ethiopia while I was working there.
p139
aVAnd you see me worried and trying to protect my child,
p140
aVbecause you don't leave anyone with this kind of child,
p141
aVeven a minister.
p142
aa(lp143
VSo then, once you've done that, the next stage is to know what it is.
p144
aV(Laughter)
p145
aVOnce that was done, then it was possible to compare.
p146
aVWe were able to tell that she belonged
p147
aVto the human family tree because the legs, the foot,
p148
aVand some features clearly showed that she walked upright,
p149
aVand upright walking is a hallmark in humanity.
p150
aVBut in addition, if you compare the skull
p151
aVwith a comparably aged chimpanzee and little George Bush here,
p152
aVyou see that you have vertical forehead.
p153
aVAnd you see that in humans, because of the development
p154
aVof the pre-frontal cortex, it's called.
p155
aVYou don't see that in chimpanzees,
p156
aVand you don't see this very projecting canine.
p157
aVSo she belongs to our family tree, but within that, of course,
p158
aVyou do detailed analysis, and we know now
p159
aVthat she belongs to the Lucy species,
p160
aVknown as Australopithecus afarensis.
p161
aa(lp162
VThe next exciting question is, girl or boy?
p163
aVAnd how old was she when she died?
p164
aVYou can determine the sex of the individual
p165
aVbased on the size of the teeth.
p166
aVHow?
p167
aVYou know, in primates, there is this phenomenon
p168
aVcalled sexual dimorphism, which simply means
p169
aVmales are larger than females and males have larger teeth
p170
aVthan the females.
p171
aVBut to do that, you need the permanent dentition,
p172
aVwhich you don't see here, because what you have here
p173
aVare the baby teeth.
p174
aVBut using the CT scanning technology,
p175
aVwhich is normally used for medical purposes,
p176
aVyou can go deep into the mouth and come up with this beautiful image
p177
aVshowing you both the baby teeth here
p178
aVand the still-growing adult teeth here.
p179
aVSo when you measure those teeth,
p180
aVit was clear that she turned out to be a girl
p181
aVwith very small canine teeth.
p182
aVAnd to know how old she was when she died, what you do is
p183
aVyou do an informed estimate, and you say, how much time would be required
p184
aVto form this amount of teeth, and the answer was three.
p185
aVSo, this girl died when she was about three,
p186
aV3.3 million years ago.
p187
aa(lp188
VSo, with all that information, the big question is \u2014
p189
aVwhat do we actually \u2014 what does she tell us?
p190
aVTo answer this question, we can phrase another question.
p191
aVWhat do we actually know about our ancestors?
p192
aVWe want to know how they looked like, how they behaved,
p193
aVhow they walked around,
p194
aVand how they lived and grew up.
p195
aVAnd among the answers that you can get from this skeleton
p196
aVare included: first, this skeleton documents,
p197
aVfor the first time, how infants looked over three million years ago.
p198
aa(lp199
VAnd second, she tells us that she walked upright,
p200
aVbut had some adaptation for tree climbing.
p201
aVAnd more interesting, however,
p202
aVis the brain in this child was still growing.
p203
aVAt age three, if you have a still-growing brain,
p204
aVit's a human behavior.
p205
aVIn chimps, by age three, the brain is formed over 90 percent.
p206
aVThat's why they can cope with their environment
p207
aVvery easily after birth \u2014 faster than us, anyway.
p208
aVBut in humans, we continue to grow our brains.
p209
aVThat's why we need care from our parents.
p210
aVBut that care means also you learn.
p211
aVYou spend more time with your parents.
p212
aVAnd that's very characteristic of humans and it's called childhood,
p213
aVwhich is this extended dependence of human children
p214
aVon their family or parents.
p215
aVSo, the still-growing brain in this individual
p216
aVtells us that childhood, which requires
p217
aVan incredible social organization,
p218
aVa very complex social organization,
p219
aVemerged over three million years ago.
p220
aa(lp221
VSo, by being at the cusp of our evolutionary history,
p222
aVSelam unites us all and gives us a unique account
p223
aVon what makes us human.
p224
aVBut not everything was human, and I will give you
p225
aVa very exciting example.
p226
aVThis is called the hyoid bone. It's a bone which is right here.
p227
aVIt supports your tongue from behind.
p228
aVIt's, in a way, your voice box.
p229
aVIt determines the type of voice you produce.
p230
aVIt was not known in the fossil record,
p231
aVand we have it in this skeleton.
p232
aVWhen we did the analysis of this bone, it was clear
p233
aVthat it looked very chimp-like, chimpanzee-like.
p234
aVSo if you were there 3.3 million years ago,
p235
aVto hear when this girl was crying out for her mother,
p236
aVshe would have sounded more like a chimpanzee than a human.
p237
aVMaybe you're wondering, "So, you see this ape feature, human feature, ape feature.
p238
aVWhat does that tell us?"
p239
aVYou know, that is very exciting for us,
p240
aVbecause it demonstrates that things were changing slowly and progressively,
p241
aVand that evolution is in the making.
p242
aa(lp243
VTo summarize the significance of this fossil,
p244
aVwe can say the following.
p245
aVUp to now, the knowledge that we had about our ancestors
p246
aVcame essentially from adult individuals
p247
aVbecause the fossils, the baby fossils, were missing.
p248
aVThey don't preserve well, as you know.
p249
aVSo the knowledge that we had about our ancestors,
p250
aVon how they looked like, how they behaved,
p251
aVwas kind of biased toward adults.
p252
aVImagine somebody coming from Mars
p253
aVand his job is to report on the type of people
p254
aVoccupying our planet Earth, and you hide all the babies,
p255
aVthe children, and he goes back and reports.
p256
aVCan you imagine how much biased his report would be?
p257
aVThat's what somehow we were doing so far
p258
aVin the absence of the fossil children,
p259
aVso I think the new fossil fixes this problem.
p260
aa(lp261
VSo, I think the most important question at the end is,
p262
aVwhat do we actually learn from specimens like this
p263
aVand from our past in general?
p264
aVOf course, in addition to extracting this huge amount
p265
aVof scientific information as to what makes us human,
p266
aVyou know, the many human ancestors that have existed
p267
aVover the past six million years \u2014 and there are more than 10 \u2014
p268
aVthey did not have the knowledge, the technology and sophistications
p269
aVthat we, Homo sapiens, have today.
p270
aVBut if this species, ancient species,
p271
aVwould travel in time and see us today,
p272
aVthey would very much be very proud of their legacy,
p273
aVbecause they became the ancestors of
p274
aVthe most successful species in the universe.
p275
aVAnd they were probably not aware of this future legacy,
p276
aVbut they did great.
p277
aVNow the question is, we Homo sapiens today
p278
aVare in a position to decide about the future of our planet, possibly more.
p279
aVSo the question is, are we up to the challenge?
p280
aVAnd can we really do better than these primitive,
p281
aVsmall-brained ancestors?
p282
aa(lp283
VAmong the most pressing challenges that our species
p284
aVis faced with today are the chronic problems of Africa.
p285
aVNeedless to list them here, and there are more competent people
p286
aVto talk about this.
p287
aVStill, in my opinion, we have two choices.
p288
aVOne is to continue to see a poor, ill, crying Africa,
p289
aVcarrying guns, that depends on other people forever,
p290
aVor to promote an Africa which is confident,
p291
aVpeaceful, independent, but cognizant of its huge problems
p292
aVand great values at the same time.
p293
aVI am for the second option, and I'm sure many of you are.
p294
aVAnd the key is to promote a positive African attitude towards Africa.
p295
aa(lp296
VThat's because we Africans concentrate \u2014
p297
aVI am from Ethiopia, by the way \u2014
p298
aVwe concentrate too much on how we are seen
p299
aVfrom elsewhere, or from outside.
p300
aVI think it's important to promote in a more positive way
p301
aVon how we see ourselves.
p302
aVThat's what I call positive African attitude.
p303
aVSo finally, I would like to say,
p304
aVso let's help Africa walk upright and forward,
p305
aVthen we all can be proud of our future legacy as a species.
p306
