VFrugal Digital is essentially a small research group at C.I.D.
p4
aVwhere we are looking to find
p5
aValternate visions of how to create a digitally inclusive society.
p6
aVThat's what we're after.
p7
aVAnd we do this because we actually believe
p8
aVthat silicon technology today is mostly about
p9
aVa culture of excess.
p10
aVIt's about the fastest and the most efficient
p11
aVand the most dazzling gadget you can have,
p12
aVwhile about two-thirds of the world
p13
aVcan hardly reach the most basic of this technology
p14
aVto even address fundamental needs in life,
p15
aVincluding health care, education
p16
aVand all these kinds of very fundamental issues.
p17
aa(lp18
VSo before I start, I want to talk about a little anecdote,
p19
aVa little story about a man I met once in Mumbai.
p20
aVSo this man, his name is Sathi Shri.
p21
aVHe is an outstanding person,
p22
aVbecause he's a small entrepreneur.
p23
aVHe runs a little shop
p24
aVin one of the back streets of Mumbai.
p25
aVHe has this little 10-square-meter store,
p26
aVwhere so much is being done.
p27
aVIt's incredible, because I couldn't believe my eyes
p28
aVwhen I once just happened to bump into him.
p29
aVBasically, what he does is, he has all these services
p30
aVfor micro-payments and booking tickets
p31
aVand all kinds of basic things that you would go online for,
p32
aVbut he does it for people offline
p33
aVand connects to the digital world.
p34
aVMore importantly, he makes his money
p35
aVby selling these mobile recharge coupons, you know,
p36
aVfor the prepaid subscriptions.
p37
aVBut then, in the backside, he's got this little nook
p38
aVwith a few of his employees
p39
aVwhere they can fix almost anything.
p40
aVAny cell phone, any gadget you can bring them, they can fix it.
p41
aVAnd it's pretty incredible because I took my iPhone there,
p42
aVand he was like, "Yeah, do you want an upgrade?"
p43
aV"Yes." (Laughter)
p44
aVI was a bit skeptical, but then, I decided
p45
aVto give him a Nokia instead. (Laughter)
p46
aa(lp47
VBut what I was amazed about is this reverse engineering
p48
aVand know-how that's built into this little two meters of space.
p49
aVThey have figured out everything that's required
p50
aVto dismantle, take things apart,
p51
aVrewrite the circuitry, re-flash the firmware,
p52
aVdo whatever you want to with the phone,
p53
aVand they can fix anything so quickly.
p54
aVYou can hand over a phone this morning
p55
aVand you can go pick it up after lunch,
p56
aVand it was quite incredible.
p57
aa(lp58
VBut then we were wondering whether this is
p59
aVa local phenomenon, or is truly global?
p60
aVAnd, over time, we started understanding
p61
aVand systematically researching
p62
aVwhat this tinkering ecosystem is about,
p63
aVbecause that is something that's happening
p64
aVnot just in one street corner in Mumbai.
p65
aVIt's actually happening in all parts of the country.
p66
aVIt's even happening in Africa, like, for example,
p67
aVin Cape Town we did extensive research on this.
p68
aVEven here in Doha I found this little nook
p69
aVwhere you can get alarm clocks and watches fixed,
p70
aVand it's a lot of tiny little parts. It's not easy.
p71
aVYou've got to try it on your own to believe it.
p72
aa(lp73
VBut what fuels this?
p74
aVIt's this entire ecosystem of low-cost parts
p75
aVand supplies that are produced all over the world, literally,
p76
aVand then redistributed to basically service this industry,
p77
aVand you can even buy salvaged parts.
p78
aVBasically, you don't have to necessarily buy
p79
aVbrand new things. You have condemned computers
p80
aVthat are stripped apart,
p81
aVand you can buy salvaged components
p82
aVand things that you can reassemble in a new configuration.
p83
aa(lp84
VBut what does this new, sort of, approach give us?
p85
aVThat's the real question, because this is something
p86
aVthat's been there, part of every society
p87
aVthat's deprived of enough resources.
p88
aVBut there's an interesting paradigm.
p89
aVThere's the traditional crafts,
p90
aVand then there's the technology crafts.
p91
aVWe call it the technology crafts because these are emerging.
p92
aVThey're not something that's been established.
p93
aVIt's not something that's institutionalized.
p94
aVIt's not taught in universities.
p95
aVIt's taught [by] word of mouth,
p96
aVand it's an informal education system around this.
p97
aa(lp98
VSo we said, "What can we get out of this?
p99
aVYou know, like, what are the key values that we can get out of this?"
p100
aVThe main thing is a fix-it-locally culture,
p101
aVwhich is fantastic because it means that your product
p102
aVor your service doesn't have to go through
p103
aVa huge bureaucratic system to get it fixed.
p104
aVIt also affords us cheap fabrication, which is fantastic,
p105
aVso it means that you can do a lot more with it.
p106
aVAnd then, the most important thing is,
p107
aVit gives us large math for low cost.
p108
aVSo it means that you can actually embed
p109
aVpretty clever algorithms and lots of other kinds
p110
aVof extendable ideas into really simple devices.
p111
aa(lp112
VSo, what we call this is a silicon cottage industry.
p113
aVIt's basically what was the system or the paradigm
p114
aVbefore the industrial revolution is now re-happening
p115
aVin a whole new way in small digital shops
p116
aVacross the planet in most developing countries.
p117
aa(lp118
VSo, we kind of toyed around with this idea,
p119
aVand we said, "What can we do with this?
p120
aVCan we make a little product or a service out of it?"
p121
aVSo one of the first things we did is this thing called
p122
aVa multimedia platform. We call it a lunch box.
p123
aVBasically one of the contexts that we studied was
p124
aVschools in very remote parts of India.
p125
aVSo there is this amazing concept called the one-teacher school,
p126
aVwhich is basically a single teacher who is a multitasker
p127
aVwho teaches this amazing little social setting.
p128
aVIt's an informal school,
p129
aVbut it's really about holistic education.
p130
aVThe only thing that they don't have
p131
aVis access to resources. They don't even have a textbook
p132
aVsometimes, and they don't even have a proper curriculum.
p133
aa(lp134
VSo we said, "What can we do to empower this teacher
p135
aVto do more?" How to access the digital world?
p136
aVInstead of being the sole guardian of information,
p137
aVbe a facilitator to all this information.
p138
aVSo we said, "What are the steps required to empower the teacher?"
p139
aVHow do you make this teacher into a digital gateway,
p140
aVand how do you design an inexpensive multimedia platform
p141
aVthat can be constructed locally and serviced locally?"
p142
aVSo we walked around.
p143
aVWe went and scavenged the nearby markets,
p144
aVand we tried to understand, "What can we pick up that will make this happen?"
p145
aa(lp146
VSo the thing that we got
p147
aVwas a little mobile phone with a little pico projector
p148
aVthat comes for about 60 dollars.
p149
aVWe went a bought a flashlight with a very big battery,
p150
aVand a bunch of small speakers.
p151
aVSo essentially, the mobile phone gives us
p152
aVa connected multimedia platform.
p153
aVIt allows us to get online and allows us to load up files
p154
aVof different formats and play them.
p155
aVThe flashlight gives us this really intense, bright L.E.D.,
p156
aVand six hours worth of rechargeable battery pack,
p157
aVand the lunch box is a nice little package
p158
aVin which you can put everything inside,
p159
aVand a bunch of mini speakers to sort of
p160
aVamplify the sound large enough.
p161
aVBelieve me, those little classrooms are really noisy.
p162
aVThey are kids who scream at the top of their voices,
p163
aVand you really have to get above that.
p164
aVAnd we took it back to this little tinkering setup
p165
aVof a mobile phone repair shop,
p166
aVand then the magic happens.
p167
aVWe dismantle the whole thing,
p168
aVwe reassemble it in a new configuration,
p169
aVand we do this hardware mashup,
p170
aVsystematically training the guy how to do this.
p171
aVOut comes this, a little lunch box \u2014 form factor.
p172
aa(lp173
V(Applause)
p174
aa(lp175
VAnd we systematically field tested,
p176
aVbecause in the field testing we learned some
p177
aVimportant lessons, and we went through many iterations.
p178
aVOne of the key issues was battery consumption and charging.
p179
aVLuminosity was an issue, when you have too much bright sunlight outside.
p180
aVOften the roofs are broken, so you don't have enough
p181
aVdarkness in the classroom to do these things.
p182
aa(lp183
VWe extended this idea. We tested it many times over,
p184
aVand the next version we came up with was a box
p185
aVthat kind of could trickle charge on solar energy,
p186
aVbut most importantly connect to a car battery,
p187
aVbecause a car battery is a ubiquitous source of power
p188
aVin places where there's not enough electricity
p189
aVor erratic electricity.
p190
aa(lp191
VAnd the other key thing that we did was
p192
aVmake this box run off a USB key, because we realized
p193
aVthat even though there was GPRS and all that on paper,
p194
aVat least, in theory, it was much more efficient
p195
aVto send the data on a little USB key by surface mail.
p196
aVIt might take a few days to get there,
p197
aVbut at least it gets there in high definition
p198
aVand in a reliable quality.
p199
aVSo we made this box, and we tested it again
p200
aVand again and again, and we're going through
p201
aVmultiple iterations to do these things.
p202
aa(lp203
VBut it's not limited to just education.
p204
aVThis kind of a technique or metrology
p205
aVcan actually be applied to other kinds of areas,
p206
aVand I'm going to tell you one more little story.
p207
aVIt's about this little device called a medi-meter.
p208
aVIt's basically a little health care screening tool that we developed.
p209
aa(lp210
VIn India, there is a context of these amazing people,
p211
aVthe health care workers called ASHA workers.
p212
aVThey are essentially foot soldiers for the health care system
p213
aVwho live in the local community and are trained
p214
aVwith basic tools and basic concepts of health care,
p215
aVand the main purpose is basically to inform people
p216
aVto basically, how to lead a better life, but also
p217
aVto divert or sort of make recommendations
p218
aVof what kind of health care should they approach?
p219
aVThey are basically referral services, essentially.
p220
aa(lp221
VBut the problem with that is that we realized
p222
aVafter a bunch of research that they are amazing
p223
aVat referring people to the nearest clinic
p224
aVor the public health care system, but what happens at the
p225
aVpublic health care system is this: these incredibly long lines
p226
aVand too many people who overload the system
p227
aVsimply because there's not enough doctors and facilities
p228
aVfor the population that's being referred.
p229
aVSo everything from a common cold
p230
aVto a serious case of malaria gets almost the same
p231
aVlevel of attention, and there's no priorities.
p232
aa(lp233
VSo we said, "Come on, there's got to be a better way
p234
aVof doing this for sure."
p235
aVSo we said, "What can we do with the ASHA worker
p236
aVthat'll allow this ASHA worker to become an interesting filter,
p237
aVbut not just a filter, a really well thought through referral
p238
aVsystem that allows load balancing of the network,
p239
aVand directs patients to different sources of health care
p240
aVbased on the severity or the criticalness of those situations?"
p241
aa(lp242
VSo the real key question was,
p243
aVhow do we empower this woman?
p244
aVHow do we empower her with simple tools
p245
aVthat's not diagnostic but more screening in nature
p246
aVso she at least knows how to advise the patients better?
p247
aVAnd that'll make such a huge difference on the system,
p248
aVbecause the amount of waiting time and the amount of
p249
aVdistances that people need to travel, often sometimes
p250
aVseven to 15 kilometers, sometimes by foot,
p251
aVto get a simple health check done, is very, very detrimental
p252
aVin the sense that it really dissuades people
p253
aVfrom getting access to health care.
p254
aVSo if there was something that she could do,
p255
aVthat would be amazing.
p256
aa(lp257
VSo what we did was that we converted this device
p258
aVinto a medical device.
p259
aVI want to demo this actually,
p260
aVbecause it's a very simple process.
p261
aa(lp262
VBruno, do you want to join us? (Cheers)
p263
aVCome along. (Applause)
p264
aa(lp265
VSo, what we're going to do is that
p266
aVwe're going to measure a few basic parameters on you,
p267
aVincluding your pulse rate and the amount of oxygen
p268
aVthat's there in your blood.
p269
aVSo you're going to put your thumb on top of this.
p270
aa(lp271
VBruno Giussani: Like this, works?
p272
aa(lp273
VVinay Venkatraman: Yeah. That's right. BG: Okay.
p274
aa(lp275
VVV: So I'm going to start it up. I hope it works.
p276
aV(Beeps) It even beeps, because it's an alarm clock, after all.
p277
aVSo ... (Laughter)
p278
aa(lp279
VSo I take it into the start position, and then
p280
aVI press the read button. (Beeps)
p281
aVSo it's taking a little reading from you. (Beeps)
p282
aVAnd then the pointer goes and points to three different options.
p283
aVLet's see what happens here.
p284
aV(Beeps) Oh Bruno, you can go home, actually.
p285
aa(lp286
VBG: Great. Good news. (Applause)
p287
aa(lp288
VVV: So ... (Applause)
p289
aa(lp290
VSo the thing about this is that
p291
aVif the pointer, unfortunately, had pointed to the red spot,
p292
aVwe would have to rush you to a hospital.
p293
aVLuckily, not today. And if it had pointed to the orange
p294
aVor the amber, it basically meant you had to have,
p295
aVsort of, more continuous care from the health care worker.
p296
aVSo that was a very simple three-step screening process
p297
aVthat could basically change the equation
p298
aVof how public health care works in so many different ways.
p299
aa(lp300
VBG: Thank you for the good news. VV: Yeah.
p301
aa(lp302
V(Applause)
p303
aVSo, very briefly, I'll just explain to you how this is done,
p304
aVbecause that's the more interesting part.
p305
aVSo essentially, the three things that are required
p306
aVto make this conversion from this guy to this guy
p307
aVis a cheap remote control for a television
p308
aVthat you can almost find in every home today,
p309
aVsome parts from a computer mouse, basically,
p310
aVsomething that you can scavenge for very low cost,
p311
aVand a few parts that have to be pre-programmed.
p312
aVBasically this is a micro-controller with a few
p313
aVextra components that can be shipped for very little cost
p314
aVacross the world, and that's what is all required
p315
aVwith a little bit of local tinkering talent
p316
aVto convert the device into something else.
p317
aVSo we are right now doing some systematic field tests
p318
aVto basically ascertain whether something like this actually
p319
aVmakes sense to the ASHA worker.
p320
aa(lp321
VWe are going through some reference tests to compare it
p322
aVagainst professional equipment to see if there's a degree
p323
aVof change in efficacy and if it actually makes an impact
p324
aVin people's lives. But most importantly,
p325
aVwhat we are trying to do right now
p326
aVis we are trying to scale this up, because there
p327
aVare over 250,000 ASHA workers on the ground
p328
aVwho are these amazing foot soldiers, and if we can
p329
aVgive at least a fraction of them the access to these things,
p330
aVit just changes the way the economics of public health care
p331
aVworks, and it changes the way systems actually function,
p332
aVnot just on a systematic planning level,
p333
aVbut also in a very grassroots, bottom-up level.
p334
aa(lp335
VSo that's it, and we hope to do this in a big way.
p336
aVThank you. (Applause)
