VI started juggling a long time ago,
p4
aVbut long before that, I was a golfer, and that's what I was, a golfer.
p5
aVAnd as a golfer and as a kid,
p6
aVone of the things that really sort of seeped into my pores,
p7
aVthat I sort of lived my whole life, is process.
p8
aVAnd it's the process of learning things.
p9
aVOne of the great things was that my father was an avid golfer, but he was lefty.
p10
aVAnd he had a real passion for golf,
p11
aVand he also created this whole mythology
p12
aVabout Ben Hogan and various things.
p13
aVWell, I learned a lot about interesting things
p14
aVthat I knew nothing about at the time, but grew to know stuff about.
p15
aVAnd that was the mythology of skill.
p16
aa(lp17
VSo, one of the things that I love to do is to explore skill.
p18
aVAnd since Richard put me on this whole thing with music \u2014
p19
aVI'm supposed to actually be doing a project with Tod Machover
p20
aVwith the MIT Media Lab \u2014 it relates a lot to music.
p21
aVBut Tod couldn't come and the project is sort of somewhere,
p22
aVI'm not sure whether it's happening the way we thought, or not.
p23
aVBut I'm going to explore skill, and juggling,
p24
aVand basically visual music, I guess.
p25
aVOK, you can start the music, thanks.
p26
aa(lp27
V(Music)
p28
aa(lp29
V(Applause)
p30
aa(lp31
VThanks. Thank you. Now, juggling can be a lot of fun;
p32
aVplay with skill and play with space, play with rhythm.
p33
aVAnd you can turn the mike on now. I'm going to do a couple of pieces.
p34
aVI do a big piece in a triangle
p35
aVand these are three sections from it.
p36
aVPart of the challenge was to try to understand rhythm and space
p37
aVusing not just my hands \u2014 because a lot of juggling is hand-oriented \u2014
p38
aVbut using the rhythm of my body and feet,
p39
aVand controlling the balls with my feet.
p40
aa(lp41
V(Applause)
p42
aa(lp43
VThanks. Now, this next section was an attempt to explore space.
p44
aVYou see, I think Richard said something about people that are against something.
p45
aVWell, a lot of people think jugglers defy gravity or do stuff.
p46
aVWell, I kind of, from my childhood and golf and all that,
p47
aVit's a process of joining with forces.
p48
aVAnd so what I'd like to do is try to figure out
p49
aVhow to join with the space through the technique.
p50
aVSo juggling gravity \u2014 up, down.
p51
aVIf you figure out what up and down really are,
p52
aVit's a complex physical set of skills
p53
aVto be able to throw a ball down and up and everything,
p54
aVbut then you add in sideways.
p55
aa(lp56
V(Applause)
p57
aa(lp58
VNow, I look at it somewhat as a way \u2014 when you learn juggling
p59
aVwhat you learn is how to feel with your eyes, and see with your hands
p60
aVbecause you're not looking at your hands,
p61
aVyou're looking at where the balls are or you're looking at the audience.
p62
aVSo this next part is really a way of understanding space and rhythm,
p63
aVwith the obvious reference to the feet,
p64
aVbut it's also time \u2014 where the feet were, where the balls were.
p65
aa(lp66
V(Applause)
p67
aa(lp68
VThanks. So, visual music: rhythm and complexity.
p69
aVI'm going to build towards complexity now.
p70
aVJuggling three balls is simple and normal.
p71
aa(lp72
V(Laughter)
p73
aa(lp74
VExcuse me.
p75
aa(lp76
V(Laughter)
p77
aa(lp78
VWe're jugglers, OK. And remember, you're transposing,
p79
aVyou're getting into a subculture here.
p80
aa(lp81
V(Laughter)
p82
aa(lp83
VAnd juggling \u2014 the balls cross and all that.
p84
aVOK, if you keep them in their assigned paths you get parallel lines
p85
aVof different heights, but then hopefully even rhythm.
p86
aVAnd you can change the rhythm \u2014 good, Michael.
p87
aVYou can change the rhythm, if you get out of the lights.
p88
aVOK? Change the rhythm, so it's even.
p89
aVOr you can go back and change the height. Now, skill.
p90
aVBut you're boxed in, if you can only do it up and down that way.
p91
aVSo, you've got to go after the space down there.
p92
aVOK, then you've got to combine them,
p93
aVbecause then you have the whole spatial palette in front of you.
p94
aVAnd then you get crazy.
p95
aa(lp96
V(Applause)
p97
aa(lp98
VNow, I'm actually going to ask you to try something,
p99
aVso you've got to pay attention. Complexity:
p100
aVif you spend enough time doing something, time slows down
p101
aVor your skill increases, so your perceptions change.
p102
aVIt's learning skills \u2014 like being in a high-speed car crash.
p103
aVThings slow down as you learn, as you learn, as you learn.
p104
aVYou may not be able to affect it, it almost drifts on you. It goes.
p105
aVBut that's the closest approximation I can have to it.
p106
aa(lp107
VSo, complexity. Now, how many here are jugglers?
p108
aVOK, so most of you are going to have a similar reaction to this.
p109
aVOK? And whoever laughed there \u2014
p110
aVyou understood it completely, right?
p111
aa(lp112
V(Laughter)
p113
aa(lp114
VNo, it looks like a mess. It looks like a mess with a guy there,
p115
aVwho's got his hands around that mess, OK.
p116
aVWell, that's what juggling is about, right?
p117
aVIt's being able to do something that other people can't do or can't understand.
p118
aVAll right. So, that's one way of doing it, which is five balls down.
p119
aVOK? Another way is the outside.
p120
aVAnd you could play with the rhythm.
p121
aVSame pattern.
p122
aVMake it faster and smaller.
p123
aVMake it wider.
p124
aVMake it narrower.
p125
aVBring it back up.
p126
aVOK. It's done. Thanks.
p127
aa(lp128
V(Applause)
p129
aa(lp130
VNow, what I wanted to get to is that you're all very bright, very tactile.
p131
aVI have no idea how computer-oriented or three-dimensionally-oriented you are,
p132
aVbut let's try something.
p133
aVOK, so since you all don't understand what the five-ball pattern is,
p134
aVI'm going to give you a little clue.
p135
aVEnough of a clue? So, you get the pattern, right? OK.
p136
aa(lp137
V(Laughter)
p138
aa(lp139
VYou're not getting off that easy. All right?
p140
aVNow, do me a favor: follow the ball that I ask you to follow.
p141
aVGreen.
p142
aVYellow.
p143
aVPink.
p144
aVWhite.
p145
aVOK, you can do that? Yeah? OK.
p146
aa(lp147
VNow, let's actually learn something.
p148
aVActually, let me put you in that area of learning, which is very insecure.
p149
aVYou want to do it? Yeah? OK.
p150
aVHands out in front of you. Palms up, together.
p151
aVWhat you're going to learn is this.
p152
aa(lp153
V(Laughter)
p154
aa(lp155
VOK? So what I want you to do is just listen to me and do it.
p156
aVIndex finger, middle finger, ring, little.
p157
aVLittle, ring, middle, index. And then open.
p158
aVFinger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger.
p159
aVA little bit faster.
p160
aVFinger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger.
p161
aVFinger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger.
p162
aa(lp163
V(Laughter)
p164
aa(lp165
VAll right. A lot of different learning processes going on in here.
p166
aa(lp167
V(Laughter)
p168
aa(lp169
VOne learning process that I see is this \u2014
p170
aa(lp171
V(Laughter)
p172
aa(lp173
VOK. Another learning process that I see is this \u2014
p174
aa(lp175
V(Laughter)
p176
aa(lp177
VOK. So, everybody take a deep breath in, breath out. OK.
p178
aVNow, one more time, and \u2014
p179
aVfinger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. Open.
p180
aVFinger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. OK.
p181
aVShake your hands out.
p182
aa(lp183
VNow, I assume a lot of you spend a lot of time at a computer.
p184
aVOK? So, what you're doing is, you're going la, la, la,
p185
aVand you're getting this. OK?
p186
aVSo that's exactly what I'm going to ask you to do,
p187
aVbut in a slightly different way. You're going to combine it.
p188
aVSo what I want you to do is \u2014 fingers.
p189
aVI'll tell you what to do with your fingers, same thing.
p190
aVBut I want you to do is also, with your eyes,
p191
aVis follow the colored ball that I ask you to follow.
p192
aa(lp193
V(Laughter)
p194
aa(lp195
VOK? Here we go.
p196
aVSo, we're going to start off looking at the white ball \u2014
p197
aVand I'm going to tell you which color,
p198
aVand I'm also going to tell you to go with your fingers. OK?
p199
aVSo white ball and \u2014
p200
aVfinger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. Pink.
p201
aVFinger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. Green.
p202
aVFinger, finger, finger, finger. Yellow.
p203
aVFinger, finger, finger, pink or finger.
p204
aVPink, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger.
p205
aVAll right.
p206
aa(lp207
V(Applause)
p208
aa(lp209
VHow did you do? Well? OK. The reason I wanted you to do this is
p210
aVbecause that's actually what most people face throughout their lives,
p211
aVa moment of learning, a moment of challenge.
p212
aVIt's a moment that you can't make sense of.
p213
aVWhy the hell should I learn this? OK?
p214
aVDoes it really have anything to do with anything in my life?
p215
aVYou know, I can't decipher \u2014 is it fun? Is it challenging? Am I supposed to cheat?
p216
aa(lp217
V(Laughter)
p218
aa(lp219
VYou know, what are you supposed to do?
p220
aVYou've got somebody up here who is the operative principle
p221
aVof doing that for his whole life. OK?
p222
aVTrying to figure that stuff out. But is it going to get you anywhere?
p223
aVIt's just a moment. That's all it is, a moment. OK?
p224
aVI'm going to change the script for one second. Just let me do this.
p225
aVI don't need music for it. Talking about time in a moment.
p226
aVThere's a piece that I recently developed which was all about that,
p227
aVa moment. And what I do as a creative artist
p228
aVis I develop vocabularies or languages of moving objects.
p229
aa(lp230
VWhat I've done for you here, I developed a lot of those tricks
p231
aVand I put the choreography together,
p232
aVbut they're not original techniques.
p233
aVNow, I'm going to start showing you some original techniques
p234
aVthat come from the work that I've developed. OK?
p235
aVSo, a moment, how would you define a moment?
p236
aVWell, as a juggler, what I wanted to do was create something
p237
aVthat was representational of a moment.
p238
aa(lp239
VAhhh.
p240
aVAll right, I'm going to get on my knees and do it.
p241
aVSo, a moment.
p242
aa(lp243
V(Rattling)
p244
aa(lp245
VOK? And then, what I did as a juggler was say,
p246
aVOK, what can I do to make that something
p247
aVthat is dependent on something else, another dynamic.
p248
aa(lp249
V(Rattling)
p250
aa(lp251
VSo, a moment.
p252
aa(lp253
V(Rattling)
p254
aa(lp255
VAnother moment.
p256
aa(lp257
V(Rattling)
p258
aa(lp259
VExcuse me, still getting there. A moment that travels.
p260
aa(lp261
V(Rattling)
p262
aa(lp263
VA moment \u2014 no, we'll try that again. It separates, and comes back together.
p264
aVTime. How can you look at time?
p265
aVAnd what do you dedicate it to, in exploring a particular thing?
p266
aVWell, obviously, there's something in here,
p267
aVand you can all have a guess as to what it is.
p268
aVThere's a mystery. There's a mystery in the moment.
p269
aVAnd it has to settle. And then it's dependent on something else.
p270
aVAnd then it comes to rest. Just a little thing about time.
p271
aa(lp272
VNow, this has expanded into a much bigger piece,
p273
aVbecause I use ramps of different parabolas that I roll the balls on
p274
aVwhile I'm keeping time with this.
p275
aVBut I just thought I'd talk about a moment.
p276
aa(lp277
V(Applause)
p278
aa(lp279
VAll right. OK. Can we show the video of the triangle?
p280
aVAre we ready to do that? Yes?
p281
aVThis is the piece that I told you about.
p282
aVIt's a much bigger piece that I do exploring the space of a geometric triangle.
p283
aa(lp284
V(Applause)
p285
aa(lp286
VThanks. The only thing I'll say about the last session is,
p287
aVyou ever try juggling and driving the car with your knees
p288
aVat 120 miles an hour?
p289
aa(lp290
V(Laughter)
p291
aa(lp292
VThe only other thing is, it was a real shock.
p293
aVI always drove motorcycles. And when I bought my first car, it shocked me
p294
aVthat it cost three times more than my parents' house. Interesting.
p295
aa(lp296
VAnyway, balance:
p297
aVconstant movement to find an approach to stillness.
p298
aVCheating.
p299
aa(lp300
V(Laughter)
p301
aa(lp302
VBalance: making up the rules so you can't cheat,
p303
aVso you learn to approach stillness with different parts of your body.
p304
aVTo have a conversation with it. To speak. To listen.
p305
aa(lp306
V(Laughter)
p307
aa(lp308
VHup. Now, it's dependent on rhythm,
p309
aVand keeping a center of balance. When it falls, going underneath.
p310
aVSo, there's a rhythm to it.
p311
aVThe rhythm can get much smaller.
p312
aVAs your skill increases, you learn to find those tinier spaces,
p313
aVthose tinier movements. Thanks.
p314
aa(lp315
V(Applause)
p316
aa(lp317
VNow, I'm going to show you the beginnings of a piece
p318
aVthat is about balance in some ways, and also \u2014
p319
aVoh, actually, if you're bored, not here, here's one use for it.
p320
aa(lp321
V(Laughter)
p322
aa(lp323
VYou can go with the "Sticks One" music.
p324
aa(lp325
V(Music)
p326
aa(lp327
V(Applause)
p328
aa(lp329
VThanks. That has a certain kind of balance to it, which is all about plumb.
p330
aVI apprenticed with a carpenter and learned about plumb, square and level.
p331
aVAnd they influenced that, and this next piece, which I'll do a little segment of.
p332
aV"Two Sticks," you can go with it. Thanks.
p333
aVWhich is again exploring space, or the lines in space.
p334
aa(lp335
V(Music)
p336
aa(lp337
V(Applause)
p338
aa(lp339
VWorking with space and the lines in space in a different way.
p340
aVOh, let's see here.
p341
aa(lp342
V(Applause)
p343
aa(lp344
VSo, I'll come back to that in a second. But working with one ball,
p345
aVnow, what if you attach something to it, or change it.
p346
aVThis is a little thing that I made
p347
aVbecause I really like the idea of curves and balls together.
p348
aVAnd then creating space and the rhythm of space,
p349
aVusing the surface of the balls, the surface of the arms.
p350
aVJust a little toy. Which leads me to the next thing,
p351
aVwhich is \u2014
p352
aVwhat have I got here? OK. All right.
p353
aa(lp354
VI'm actually leading up to something,
p355
aVthe newest thing that I'm working on. This is not it.
p356
aVThis is exploring geometry and the rhythm of shape.
p357
aa(lp358
V(Applause)
p359
aa(lp360
VNow, what I just did was I worked with the mathematics \u2014
p361
aVthe diameter and the circumference.
p362
aVSometimes these pieces are mathematical, in that way
p363
aVthat I look at a shape and say, what about if I use this and this and this.
p364
aVSometimes what happens in life affects my choice
p365
aVof objects that I try to work with.
p366
aa(lp367
VThe next piece that I'm going to do \u2014 which is the cylinders piece,
p368
aVif you want to get that up \u2014
p369
aVit has to do with cylinder seals from about 5,000 years ago,
p370
aVwhich were stones with designs that were used to roll over wet clay
p371
aVwith all sorts of great designs. I love ceramics and all of that.
p372
aVIt's a combination of that, the beauty of that, the shape,
p373
aVand the stories that were involved in it,
p374
aVas well as the fact that they protected the contents.
p375
aa(lp376
VThe second influence on this piece came from recycling
p377
aVand looking into a tin can recycling bin
p378
aVand seeing all that beautiful emptiness.
p379
aVSo, if you want to go with the music for cylinders.
p380
aa(lp381
V(Music)
p382
aa(lp383
V(Applause)
p384
aa(lp385
VTalking about geometry and everything,
p386
aVif you take the circle and you split it in half \u2014
p387
aVcan you run "S-Curve music?"
p388
aVI'm going to do just a short version of it.
p389
aVCircles split in half and rotated, and mythology.
p390
aa(lp391
V(Music)
p392
aa(lp393
V(Applause)
p394
aa(lp395
VAnyway, that piece also has a kinetic sculpture in the middle of it,
p396
aVand I dance around a small stage so \u2014
p397
aVtwo minutes, just to end? The latest piece that I'm working on \u2014
p398
aVwhat I love is that I never know what I'm working on, why I'm working on it.
p399
aVThey're not ideas, they're instincts.
p400
aVAnd the latest thing that I'm working on \u2014
p401
aa(lp402
V(Clattering) \u2014
p403
aa(lp404
Vis something really \u2014 I don't know what it is yet.
p405
aVAnd that's good. I like not to know for as long as possible.
p406
aVWell, because then it tells me the truth,
p407
aVinstead of me imposing the truth.
p408
aVAnd what it is, is working with both positive and negative space
p409
aVbut also with these curves.
p410
aVAnd what it involves,
p411
aVand I don't know if my hands are too beaten up to do it or not,
p412
aVbut I'll do a little bit of it.
p413
aa(lp414
VIt initially started off with me stacking these things,
p415
aVbunches of them, and then playing with the sense of space,
p416
aVof filling in the space. And then it started changing,
p417
aVand become folding on themselves.
p418
aVAnd then changing levels.
p419
aVBecause my attempt is to make visual instruments,
p420
aVnot to just make \u2014 I'll try one other thing.
p421
aVFor work in three dimensions, with your perceptions of space and time.
p422
aVNow, I don't know exactly where it's going,
p423
aVbut I've got a bit of effort involved in this thing.
p424
aVAnd it's going to change as I go through it.
p425
aVBut I really like it, it feels right.
p426
aVThis may not be the right shape, and \u2014 look at this shape,
p427
aVand then I'll show you the first design I ever put to it,
p428
aVjust to see, just to play,
p429
aVbecause I love all different kinds of things to play with.
p430
aVLet's see here.
p431
aVTo work with the positive and negative in a different way.
p432
aVAnd to change, and to change.
p433
aa(lp434
VSo, I'm off in my new direction with this to explore rhythm and space.
p435
aVWe'll see what I come up with. Thanks for having me.
