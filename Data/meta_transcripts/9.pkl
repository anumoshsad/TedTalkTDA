VAs you pointed out, every time you come here, you learn something.
p4
aVThis morning, the world's experts
p5
aVfrom I guess three or four different companies on building seats,
p6
aVI think concluded that ultimately, the solution is, people shouldn't sit down.
p7
aVI could have told them that.
p8
aV(Laughter)
p9
aVYesterday, the automotive guys gave us some new insights.
p10
aVThey pointed out that, I believe it was between 30 and 50 years from today,
p11
aVthey will be steering cars by wire,
p12
aVwithout all that mechanical stuff.
p13
aV(Laughter)
p14
aVThat's reassuring.
p15
aV(Applause)
p16
aVThey then pointed out that there'd be, sort of, the other controls by wire,
p17
aVto get rid of all that mechanical stuff.
p18
aVThat's pretty good, but why not get rid of the wires?
p19
aVThen you don't need anything to control the car, except thinking about it.
p20
aVI would love to talk about the technology,
p21
aVand sometime, in what's past the 15 minutes,
p22
aVI'll be happy to talk to all the techno-geeks around here
p23
aVabout what's in here.
p24
aVBut if I had one thing to say about this, before we get to first,
p25
aVit would be that from the time we started building this,
p26
aVthe big idea wasn't the technology.
p27
aVIt really was a big idea in technology when we started applying it
p28
aVin the iBOT for the disabled community.
p29
aVThe big idea here is, I think, a new piece of a solution
p30
aVto a fairly big problem in transportation.
p31
aVAnd maybe to put that in perspective: there's so much data on this,
p32
aVI'll be happy to give it to you in different forms.
p33
aVYou never know what strikes the fancy of whom,
p34
aVbut everybody is perfectly willing to believe the car changed the world.
p35
aVAnd Henry Ford, just about 100 years ago, started cranking out Model Ts.
p36
aVWhat I don't think most people think about
p37
aVis the context of how technology is applied.
p38
aVFor instance, in that time, 91 percent of America
p39
aVlived either on farms or in small towns.
p40
aVSo, the car \u2014
p41
aVthe horseless carriage that replaced the horse and carriage \u2014 was a big deal;
p42
aVit went twice as fast as a horse and carriage.
p43
aVIt was half as long.
p44
aVAnd it was an environmental improvement, because, for instance,
p45
aVin 1903 they outlawed horses and buggies in downtown Manhattan,
p46
aVbecause you can imagine what the roads look like
p47
aVwhen you have a million horses,
p48
aVand a million of them urinating and doing other things,
p49
aVand the typhoid and other problems created were almost unimaginable.
p50
aVSo the car was the clean environmental alternative to a horse and buggy.
p51
aVIt also was a way for people to get from their farm to a farm,
p52
aVor their farm to a town, or from a town to a city.
p53
aVIt all made sense, with 91 percent of the people living there.
p54
aVBy the 1950s, we started connecting all the towns together
p55
aVwith what a lot of people claim is the eighth wonder of the world, the highway system.
p56
aVAnd it is certainly a wonder.
p57
aVAnd by the way, as I take shots at old technologies,
p58
aVI want to assure everybody, and particularly the automotive industry \u2014
p59
aVwho's been very supportive of us \u2014
p60
aVthat I don't think this in any way competes with airplanes, or cars.
p61
aVBut think about where the world is today.
p62
aV50 percent of the global population now lives in cities.
p63
aVThat's 3.2 billion people.
p64
aVWe've solved all the transportation problems
p65
aVthat have changed the world to get it to where we are today.
p66
aV500 years ago, sailing ships started getting reliable enough;
p67
aVwe found a new continent.
p68
aV150 years ago, locomotives got efficient enough, steam power,
p69
aVthat we turned the continent into a country.
p70
aVOver the last hundred years, we started building cars,
p71
aVand then over the 50 years we've connected every city to every other city
p72
aVin an extraordinarily efficient way,
p73
aVand we have a very high standard of living as a consequence of that.
p74
aVBut during that entire process, more and more people have been born,
p75
aVand more and more people are moving to cities.
p76
aVChina alone is going to move four to six hundred million people
p77
aVinto cities in the next decade and a half.
p78
aVAnd so, nobody, I think, would argue that airplanes, in the last 50 years,
p79
aVhave turned the continent and the country now into a neighborhood.
p80
aVAnd if you just look at how technology has been applied,
p81
aVwe've solved all the long-range, high-speed, high-volume,
p82
aVlarge-weight problems of moving things around.
p83
aVNobody would want to give them up.
p84
aVAnd I certainly wouldn't want to give up my airplane,
p85
aVor my helicopter, or my Humvee, or my Porsche.
p86
aVI love them all. I don't keep any of them in my living room.
p87
aVThe fact is, the last mile is the problem,
p88
aVand half the world now lives in dense cities.
p89
aVAnd people spend, depending on who they are,
p90
aVbetween 90 and 95 percent of their energy getting around on foot.
p91
aVI think there's \u2014 I don't know what data would impress you,
p92
aVbut how about, 43 percent of the refined fuel produced in the world
p93
aVis consumed by cars in metropolitan areas in the United States.
p94
aVThree million people die every year in cities due to bad air,
p95
aVand almost all particulate pollution on this planet
p96
aVis produced by transportation devices, particularly sitting in cities.
p97
aVAnd again, I say that not to attack any industry,
p98
aVI think \u2014 I really do \u2014 I love my airplane,
p99
aVand cars on highways moving 60 miles an hour
p100
aVare extraordinarily efficient,
p101
aVboth from an engineering point of view,
p102
aVan energy consumption point of view, and a utility point of view.
p103
aVAnd we all love our cars, and I do.
p104
aVThe problem is, you get into the city and you want to go four blocks,
p105
aVit's neither fun nor efficient nor productive.
p106
aVIt's not sustainable.
p107
aVIf \u2014 in China, in the year 1998, 417 million people used bicycles;
p108
aV1.7 million people used cars.
p109
aVIf five percent of that population became, quote, middle class,
p110
aVand wanted to go the way we've gone in the last hundred years
p111
aVat the same time that 50 percent of their population are moving into cities
p112
aVof the size and density of Manhattan, every six weeks \u2014
p113
aVit isn't sustainable environmentally;
p114
aVit isn't sustainable economically \u2014 there just ain't enough oil \u2014
p115
aVand it's not sustainable politically.
p116
aVI mean, what are we fighting over right now?
p117
aVWe can make it complicated, but what's the world fighting over right now?
p118
aVSo it seemed to me that somebody had to work on that last mile,
p119
aVand it was dumb luck. We were working on iBOTs,
p120
aVbut once we made this, we instantly decided
p121
aVit could be a great alternative to jet skis. You don't need the water.
p122
aVOr snowmobiles. You don't need the snow.
p123
aVOr skiing. It's just fun, and people love to move around doing fun things.
p124
aVAnd every one of those industries, by the way \u2014
p125
aVjust golf carts alone is a multi-billion-dollar industry.
p126
aVBut rather than go license this off, which is what we normally do,
p127
aVit seemed to me that if we put all our effort not into the technology,
p128
aVbut into an understanding of a world that's solved all its other problems,
p129
aVbut has somehow come to accept that cities \u2014 which,
p130
aVright back from ancient Greece on, were meant to walk around,
p131
aVcities that were architected and built for people \u2014
p132
aVnow have a footprint that,
p133
aVwhile we've solved every other transportation problem \u2014
p134
aVand it's like Moore's law.
p135
aVI mean, look at the time it took to cross a continent in a Conestoga wagon,
p136
aVthen on a railroad, then an airplane.
p137
aVEvery other form of transportation's been improved.
p138
aVIn 5,000 years, we've gone backwards in getting around cities.
p139
aVThey've gotten bigger; they're spread out.
p140
aVThe most expensive real estate on this planet in every city \u2014
p141
aVWilshire Boulevard, or Fifth Avenue, or Tokyo, or Paris \u2014
p142
aVthe most expensive real estate is their downtowns.
p143
aV65 percent of the landmass of our cities are parked cars.
p144
aVThe 20 largest cities in the world.
p145
aVSo you wonder, what if cities could give to their pedestrians
p146
aVwhat we take for granted as we now go between cities?
p147
aVWhat if you could make them fun, attractive, clean,
p148
aVenvironmentally friendly?
p149
aVWhat if it would make it a little bit more palatable
p150
aVto have access via this, as that last link to mass transit,
p151
aVto get out to your cars so we can all live in the suburbs
p152
aVand use our cars the way we want,
p153
aVand then have our cities energized again?
p154
aVWe thought it would be really neat to do that,
p155
aVand one of the problems we really were worried about
p156
aVis: how do we get legal on the sidewalk?
p157
aVBecause technically I've got motors; I've got wheels \u2014 I'm a motor vehicle.
p158
aVI don't look like a motor vehicle.
p159
aVI have the same footprint as a pedestrian;
p160
aVI have the same unique capability
p161
aVto deal with other pedestrians in a crowded space.
p162
aVI took this down to Ground Zero,
p163
aVand knocked my way through crowds for an hour.
p164
aVI'm a pedestrian. But the law typically lags technology by a generation or two,
p165
aVand if we get told we don't belong on the sidewalk, we have two choices.
p166
aVWe're a recreational vehicle that doesn't really matter,
p167
aVand I don't spend my time doing that kind of stuff.
p168
aVOr maybe we should be out in the street
p169
aVin front of a Greyhound bus or a vehicle.
p170
aVWe've been so concerned about that,
p171
aVwe went to the Postmaster General of the United States,
p172
aVas the first person we ever showed on the outside,
p173
aVand said, "Put your people on it. Everybody trusts their postman.
p174
aVAnd they belong on the sidewalks, and they'll use it seriously."
p175
aVHe agreed. We went to a number of police departments
p176
aVthat want their police officers back in the neighborhood
p177
aVon the beat, carrying 70 pounds of stuff. They love it.
p178
aVAnd I can't believe a policeman is going to give themselves a ticket.
p179
aV(Laughter)
p180
aVSo we've been working really, really hard,
p181
aVbut we knew that the technology would not be as hard to develop
p182
aVas an attitude about what's important, and how to apply the technology.
p183
aVWe went out and we found some visionary people
p184
aVwith enough money to let us design and build these things,
p185
aVand in hopefully enough time to get them accepted.
p186
aVSo, I'm happy, really, I am happy to talk about this technology as much as you want.
p187
aVAnd yes, it's really fun, and yes, you should all go out and try it.
p188
aVBut if I could ask you to do one thing,
p189
aVit's not to think about it as a piece of technology,
p190
aVbut just imagine that, although we all understand somehow
p191
aVthat it's reasonable that we use our 4,000-pound machine,
p192
aVwhich can go 60 miles an hour,
p193
aVthat can bring you everywhere you want to go,
p194
aVand somehow it's also what we used for the last mile,
p195
aVand it's broken, and it doesn't work.
p196
aVOne of the more exciting things that occurred to us
p197
aVabout why it might get accepted, happened out here in California.
p198
aVA few weeks ago, after we launched it,
p199
aVwe were here with a news crew on Venice Beach, zipping up and back,
p200
aVand he's marveling at the technology,
p201
aVand meanwhile bicycles are zipping by,
p202
aVand skateboarders are zipping by,
p203
aVand a little old lady \u2014 I mean, if you looked in the dictionary,
p204
aVa little old lady \u2014 came by me \u2014
p205
aVand now that I'm on this, I'm the height of a normal adult now \u2014
p206
aVand she just stops, and the camera is there, and she looks up at me
p207
aVand says, "Can I try that?"
p208
aVAnd what was I \u2014 you know, how are you going to say anything?
p209
aVAnd so I said, "Sure."
p210
aVSo I get off, and she gets on, and with a little bit of the usual, ah,
p211
aVthen she turns around, and she goes about 20 feet,
p212
aVand she turns back around, and she's all smiles.
p213
aVAnd she comes back to me and she stops, and she says,
p214
aV"Finally, they made something for us."
p215
aVAnd the camera is looking down at her.
p216
aVI'm thinking, "Wow, that was great \u2014
p217
aV(Laughter)
p218
aV\u2014 please lady, don't say another word."
p219
aV(Laughter)
p220
aVAnd the camera is down at her,
p221
aVand this guy has to put the microphone in her face,
p222
aVsaid, "What do you mean by that?"
p223
aVAnd I figured, "It's all over now,"
p224
aVand she looks up and she says, "Well,"
p225
aVshe's still watching these guys go; she says, "I can't ride a bike," no,
p226
aVshe says, "I can't use a skateboard, and I've never used roller blades,"
p227
aVshe knew them by name;
p228
aVshe says, "And it's been 50 years since I rode a bicycle."
p229
aVThen she looks up, she's looking up, and she says,
p230
aV"And I'm 81 years old, and I don't drive a car anymore.
p231
aVI still have to get to the store, and I can't carry a lot of things."
p232
aVAnd it suddenly occurred to me, that among my many fears,
p233
aVwere not just that the bureaucracy and the regulators
p234
aVand the legislators might not get it \u2014
p235
aVit was that, fundamentally, you believe there's pressure among the people
p236
aVnot to invade the most precious little bit of space left,
p237
aVthe sidewalks in these cities.
p238
aVWhen you look at the 36 inches of legal requirement for sidewalk,
p239
aVthen the eight foot for the parked car, then the three lanes,
p240
aVand then the other eight feet \u2014 it's \u2014
p241
aVthat little piece is all that's there.
p242
aVBut she looks up and says this,
p243
aVand it occurs to me, well, kids aren't going to mind these things,
p244
aVand they don't vote, and business people and then young adults
p245
aVaren't going to mind these things \u2014 they're pretty cool \u2014
p246
aVso I guess subliminally I was worried
p247
aVthat it's the older population that's going to worry.
p248
aVSo, having seen this, and having worried about it for eight years,
p249
aVthe first thing I do is pick up my phone and ask our marketing and regulatory guys,
p250
aVcall AARP, get an appointment right away.
p251
aVWe've got to show them this thing.
p252
aVAnd they took it to Washington; they showed them;
p253
aVand they're going to be involved now,
p254
aVwatching how these things get absorbed in a number of cities,
p255
aVlike Atlanta, where we're doing trials to see if it really can, in fact,
p256
aVhelp re-energize their downtown.
p257
aV(Applause)
p258
aVThe bottom line is, whether you believe the United Nations,
p259
aVor any of the other think tanks \u2014
p260
aVin the next 20 years, all human population growth on this planet
p261
aVwill be in cities.
p262
aVIn Asia alone, it will be over a billion people.
p263
aVThey learned to start with cell phones.
p264
aVThey didn't have to take the 100-year trip we took.
p265
aVThey start at the top of the technology food chain.
p266
aVWe've got to start building cities and human environments
p267
aVwhere a 150-pound person can go a couple of miles
p268
aVin a dense, rich, green-space environment,
p269
aVwithout being in a 4,000-pound machine to do it.
p270
aVCars were not meant for parallel parking;
p271
aVthey're wonderful machines to go between cities, but just think about it:
p272
aVwe've solved all the long-range, high-speed problems.
p273
aVThe Greeks went from the theater of Dionysus to the Parthenon in their sandals.
p274
aVYou do it in your sneakers.
p275
aVNot much has changed.
p276
aVIf this thing goes only three times as fast as walking \u2014 three times \u2014
p277
aVa 30-minute walk becomes 10 minutes.
p278
aVYour choice, when living in a city, if it's now 10 minutes \u2014
p279
aVbecause at 30 minutes you want an alternative, whether it's a bus, a train \u2014
p280
aVwe've got to build an infrastructure \u2014 a light rail \u2014
p281
aVor you're going to keep parking those cars.
p282
aVBut if you could put a pin in most cities,
p283
aVand imagine how far you could, if you had the time, walk in one half-hour, it's the city.
p284
aVIf you could make it fun, and make it eight or 10 minutes,
p285
aVyou can't find your car, un-park your car, move your car,
p286
aVre-park your car and go somewhere;
p287
aVyou can't get to a cab or a subway.
p288
aVWe could change the way people allocate their resources,
p289
aVthe way this planet uses its energy,
p290
aVmake it more fun.
p291
aVAnd we're hoping to some extent history will say we were right.
p292
aVThat's Segway. This is a Stirling cycle engine;
p293
aVthis had been confused by a lot of things we're doing.
p294
aVThis little beast, right now, is producing a few hundred watts of electricity.
p295
aVYes, it could be attached to this,
p296
aVand yes, on a kilogram of propane,
p297
aVyou could drive from New York to Boston if you so choose.
p298
aVPerhaps more interesting about this little engine is it'll burn any fuel,
p299
aVbecause some of you might be skeptical
p300
aVabout the capability of this to have an impact,
p301
aVwhere most of the world you can't simply plug into your 120-volt outlet.
p302
aVWe've been working on this,
p303
aVactually, as an alternative energy source,
p304
aVstarting way back with Johnson & Johnson, to run an iBOT,
p305
aVbecause the best batteries you could get \u2014
p306
aV10 watt-hours per kilogram in lead,
p307
aV20 watt-hours per kilogram nickel-cadmium,
p308
aV40 watt-hours per kilogram in nickel-metal hydride,
p309
aV60 watt-hours per kilogram in lithium,
p310
aV8,750 watt-hours of energy in every kilogram of propane or gasoline \u2014
p311
aVwhich is why nobody drives electric cars.
p312
aVBut, in any event, if you can burn it with the same efficiency \u2014
p313
aVbecause it's external combustion \u2014 as your kitchen stove,
p314
aVif you can burn any fuel, it turns out to be pretty neat.
p315
aVIt makes just enough electricity to, for instance, do this,
p316
aVwhich at night is enough electricity, in the rest of the world,
p317
aVas Mr. Holly \u2014 Dr. Holly \u2014 pointed out,
p318
aVcan run computers and a light bulb.
p319
aVBut more interestingly, the thermodynamics of this say,
p320
aVyou're never going to get more than 20 percent efficiency.
p321
aVIt doesn't matter much \u2014 it says if you get 200 watts of electricity,
p322
aVyou'll get 700 or 800 watts of heat.
p323
aVIf you wanted to boil water and re-condense it at a rate of 10 gallons an hour,
p324
aVit takes about 25, a little over 25.3 kilowatt \u2014
p325
aV25,000 watts of continuous power \u2014 to do it.
p326
aVThat's so much energy, you couldn't afford to desalinate
p327
aVor clean water in this country that way.
p328
aVCertainly, in the rest of the world, your choice is to devastate the place,
p329
aVturning everything that will burn into heat, or drink the water that's available.
p330
aVThe number one cause of death on this planet among humans is bad water.
p331
aVDepending on whose numbers you believe,
p332
aVit's between 60 and 85,000 people per day.
p333
aVWe don't need sophisticated heart transplants around the world.
p334
aVWe need water.
p335
aVAnd women shouldn't have to spend four hours a day looking for it,
p336
aVor watching their kids die.
p337
aVWe figured out how to put a vapor-compression distiller on this thing,
p338
aVwith a counter-flow heat exchanger to take the waste heat,
p339
aVthen using a little bit of the electricity control that process,
p340
aVand for 450 watts, which is a little more than half of its waste heat,
p341
aVit will make 10 gallons an hour of distilled water
p342
aVfrom anything that comes into it to cool it.
p343
aVSo if we put this box on here in a few years,
p344
aVcould we have a solution to transportation, electricity,
p345
aVand communication, and maybe drinkable water
p346
aVin a sustainable package that weighs 60 pounds?
p347
aVI don't know, but we'll try it.
p348
aVI better shut up.
