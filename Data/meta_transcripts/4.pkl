VI want to start off by saying, Houston, we have a problem.
p4
aVWe're entering a second generation of no progress
p5
aVin terms of human flight in space. In fact, we've regressed.
p6
aVWe stand a very big chance of losing our ability to inspire our youth
p7
aVto go out and continue this very important thing
p8
aVthat we as a species have always done.
p9
aVAnd that is, instinctively we've gone out
p10
aVand climbed over difficult places, went to more hostile places,
p11
aVand found out later, maybe to our surprise, that that's the reason we survived.
p12
aVAnd I feel very strongly
p13
aVthat it's not good enough for us to have generations of kids
p14
aVthat think that it's OK to look forward to a better version
p15
aVof a cell phone with a video in it.
p16
aVThey need to look forward to exploration; they need to look forward to colonization;
p17
aVthey need to look forward to breakthroughs.
p18
aVWe need to inspire them, because they need to lead us
p19
aVand help us survive in the future.
p20
aa(lp21
VI'm particularly troubled that what NASA's doing right now with this new Bush doctrine
p22
aVto \u2014 for this next decade and a half \u2014 oh shoot, I screwed up.
p23
aVWe have real specific instructions here not to talk about politics.
p24
aa(lp25
V(Laughter)
p26
aa(lp27
VWhat we're looking forward to is \u2014
p28
aa(lp29
V(Applause)
p30
aa(lp31
Vwhat we're looking forward to
p32
aVis not only the inspiration of our children,
p33
aVbut the current plan right now is not really even allowing
p34
aVthe most creative people in this country \u2014 the Boeing's and Lockheed's
p35
aVspace engineers \u2014 to go out and take risks and try new stuff.
p36
aVWe're going to go back to the moon ... 50 years later?
p37
aVAnd we're going to do it very specifically planned to not learn anything new.
p38
aVI'm really troubled by that. But anyway that's \u2014
p39
aVthe basis of the thing that I want to share with you today, though,
p40
aVis that right back to where we inspire people
p41
aVwho will be our great leaders later.
p42
aVThat's the theme of my next 15 minutes here.
p43
aVAnd I think that the inspiration begins when you're very young:
p44
aVthree-year-olds, up to 12-, 14-year-olds.
p45
aVWhat they look at is the most important thing.
p46
aa(lp47
VLet's take a snapshot at aviation.
p48
aVAnd there was a wonderful little short four-year time period
p49
aVwhen marvelous things happened.
p50
aVIt started in 1908, when the Wright brothers flew in Paris, and everybody said,
p51
aV"Ooh, hey, I can do that." There's only a few people that have flown
p52
aVin early 1908. In four years, 39 countries had hundreds of airplanes,
p53
aVthousand of pilots. Airplanes were invented by natural selection.
p54
aVNow you can say that intelligent design designs our airplanes of today,
p55
aVbut there was no intelligent design really designing those early airplanes.
p56
aVThere were probably at least 30,000 different things tried,
p57
aVand when they crash and kill the pilot, don't try that again.
p58
aVThe ones that flew and landed OK
p59
aVbecause there were no trained pilots
p60
aVwho had good flying qualities by definition.
p61
aVSo we, by making a whole bunch of attempts, thousands of attempts,
p62
aVin that four-year time period, we invented the concepts
p63
aVof the airplanes that we fly today. And that's why they're so safe,
p64
aVas we gave it a lot of chance to find what's good.
p65
aVThat has not happened at all in space flying.
p66
aVThere's only been two concepts tried \u2014 two by the U.S. and one by the Russians.
p67
aa(lp68
VWell, who was inspired during that time period?
p69
aVAviation Week asked me to make a list of who I thought
p70
aVwere the movers and shakers of the first 100 years of aviation.
p71
aVAnd I wrote them down and I found out later that every one of them
p72
aVwas a little kid in that wonderful renaissance of aviation.
p73
aVWell, what happened when I was a little kid was \u2014 some pretty heavy stuff too.
p74
aVThe jet age started: the missile age started. Von Braun was on there
p75
aVshowing how to go to Mars \u2014 and this was before Sputnik.
p76
aVAnd this was at a time when Mars was a hell of a lot more interesting
p77
aVthan it is now. We thought there'd be animals there;
p78
aVwe knew there were plants there; the colors change, right?
p79
aVBut, you know, NASA screwed that up because they've sent these robots
p80
aVand they've landed it only in the deserts.
p81
aa(lp82
V(Laughter)
p83
aa(lp84
VIf you look at what happened \u2014 this little black line is as fast as man ever flew,
p85
aVand the red line is top-of-the-line military fighters
p86
aVand the blue line is commercial air transport.
p87
aVYou notice here's a big jump when I was a little kid \u2014
p88
aVand I think that had something to do with giving me the courage
p89
aVto go out and try something that other people weren't having the courage to try.
p90
aVWell, what did I do when I was a kid?
p91
aVI didn't do the hotrods and the girls and the dancing
p92
aVand, well, we didn't have drugs in those days. But I did competition model airplanes.
p93
aVI spent about seven years during the Vietnam War
p94
aVflight-testing airplanes for the Air Force.
p95
aVAnd then I went in and I had a lot of fun building airplanes
p96
aVthat people could build in their garages.
p97
aVAnd some 3,000 of those are flying. Of course, one of them
p98
aVis around the world Voyager. I founded another company in '82,
p99
aVwhich is my company now.
p100
aVAnd we have developed more than one new type of airplane every year since 1982.
p101
aVAnd there's a lot of them that I actually can't show you on this chart.
p102
aa(lp103
VThe most impressive airplane ever, I believe, was designed
p104
aVonly a dozen years after the first operational jet.
p105
aVStayed in service till it was too rusty to fly, taken out of service.
p106
aVWe retreated in '98 back to something that was developed in '56. What?
p107
aVThe most impressive spaceship ever, I believe,
p108
aVwas a Grumman Lunar Lander. It was a \u2014 you know, it landed on the moon,
p109
aVtake off of the moon, didn't need any maintenance guys \u2014
p110
aVthat's kind of cool.
p111
aVWe've lost that capability. We abandoned it in '72.
p112
aVThis thing was designed three years after Gagarin first flew in space in 1961.
p113
aVThree years, and we can't do that now. Crazy.
p114
aa(lp115
VTalk very briefly about innovation cycles, things that grow,
p116
aVhave a lot of activity; they die out when they're replaced by something else.
p117
aVThese things tend to happen every 25 years.
p118
aV40 years long, with an overlap. You can put that statement
p119
aVon all kinds of different technologies. The interesting thing \u2014
p120
aVby the way, the speed here, excuse me, higher-speed travel
p121
aVis the title of these innovation cycles. There is none here.
p122
aVThese two new airplanes are the same speed as the DC8 that was done in 1958.
p123
aVHere's the biggie, and that is, you don't have innovation cycles
p124
aVif the government develops and the government uses it.
p125
aVYou know, a good example, of course, is the DARPA net.
p126
aVComputers were used for artillery first, then IRS.
p127
aVBut when we got it, now you have all the level of activity,
p128
aVall the benefit from it. Private sector has to do it.
p129
aVKeep that in mind. I put down innovation \u2014
p130
aVI've looked for innovation cycles in space; I found none.
p131
aa(lp132
VThe very first year, starting when Gagarin went in space,
p133
aVand a few weeks later Alan Shepherd, there were five manned
p134
aVspace flights in the world \u2014 the very first year.
p135
aVIn 2003, everyone that the United States sent to space was killed.
p136
aVThere were only three or four flights in 2003.
p137
aVIn 2004, there were only two flights: two Russian Soyuz flights
p138
aVto the international manned station. And I had to fly three in Mojave
p139
aVwith my little group of a couple dozen people
p140
aVin order to get to a total of five,
p141
aVwhich was the number the same year back in 1961.
p142
aVThere is no growth. There's no activity. There's no nothing.
p143
aa(lp144
VThis is a picture here taken from SpaceShipOne.
p145
aVThis is a picture here taken from orbit.
p146
aVOur goal is to make it so that you can see this picture and really enjoy that.
p147
aVWe know how to do it for sub-orbital flying now, do it safe enough \u2014
p148
aVat least as safe as the early airlines \u2014 so that can be done.
p149
aVAnd I think I want to talk a little bit about why we had the courage
p150
aVto go out and try that as a small company.
p151
aa(lp152
VWell, first of all, what's going to happen next?
p153
aVThe first industry will be a high volume, a lot of players.
p154
aVThere's another one announced just last week.
p155
aVAnd it will be sub-orbital. And the reason it has to be sub-orbital
p156
aVis, there is not solutions for adequate safety
p157
aVto fly the public to orbit. The governments have been doing this \u2014
p158
aVthree governments have been doing this for 45 years,
p159
aVand still four percent of the people that have left the atmosphere have died.
p160
aVThat's \u2014 You don't want to run a business with that kind of a safety record.
p161
aVIt'll be very high volume; we think 100,000 people will fly by 2020.
p162
aVI can't tell you when this will start,
p163
aVbecause I don't want my competition to know my schedule.
p164
aVBut I think once it does, we will find solutions,
p165
aVand very quickly, you'll see those resort hotels in orbit.
p166
aVAnd that real easy thing to do, which is a swing around the moon
p167
aVso you have this cool view. And that will be really cool.
p168
aVBecause the moon doesn't have an atmosphere \u2014
p169
aVyou can do an elliptical orbit and miss it by 10 feet if you want.
p170
aVOh, it's going to be so much fun.
p171
aa(lp172
V(Laughter)
p173
aa(lp174
VOK. My critics say, "Hey, Rutan's just spending
p175
aVa lot of these billionaires' money for joyrides for billionaires.
p176
aVWhat's this? This is not a transportation system; it's just for fun."
p177
aVAnd I used to be bothered by that, and then I got to thinking,
p178
aVwell, wait a minute. I bought my first Apple computer in 1978
p179
aVand I bought it because I could say, "I got a computer at my house and you don't.
p180
aV'What do you use it for?' Come over. It does Frogger." OK.
p181
aa(lp182
V(Laughter)
p183
aa(lp184
VNot the bank's computer or Lockheed's computer,
p185
aVbut the home computer was for games.
p186
aVFor a whole decade it was for fun \u2014 we didn't even know what it was for.
p187
aVBut what happened, the fact that we had this big industry,
p188
aVbig development, big improvement and capability and so on,
p189
aVand they get out there in enough homes \u2014 we were ripe for a new invention.
p190
aVAnd the inventor is in this audience.
p191
aVAl Gore invented the Internet and because of that,
p192
aVsomething that we used for a whole year \u2014 excuse me \u2014
p193
aVa whole decade for fun, became everything \u2014 our commerce, our research,
p194
aVour communication and, if we let the Google guys
p195
aVthink for another couple weekends, we can add a dozen more things to the list. (Laughter)
p196
aVAnd it won't be very long before you won't be able to convince kids
p197
aVthat we didn't always have computers in our homes.
p198
aVSo fun is defendable.
p199
aa(lp200
VOK, I want to show you kind of a busy chart,
p201
aVbut in it is my prediction with what's going to happen.
p202
aVAnd in it also brings up another point, right here.
p203
aVThere's a group of people that have come forward \u2014
p204
aVand you don't know all of them \u2014 but the ones that have come forward
p205
aVwere inspired as young children, this little three- to 15-year-old age,
p206
aVby us going to orbit and going to the moon here,
p207
aVright in this time period.
p208
aVPaul Allen, Elan Musk, Richard Branson, Jeff Bezos, the Ansari family,
p209
aVwhich is now funding the Russians' sub-orbital thing,
p210
aVBob Bigelow, a private space station, and Carmack.
p211
aVThese people are taking money and putting it in an interesting area,
p212
aVand I think it's a lot better than they put it in an area
p213
aVof a better cell phone or something \u2014 but they're putting it in very \u2014
p214
aVareas and this will lead us into this kind of capability,
p215
aVand it will lead us into the next really big thing
p216
aVand it will allow us to explore. And I think eventually
p217
aVit will allow us to colonize and to keep us from going extinct.
p218
aa(lp219
VThey were inspired by big progress. But look at the progress that's going on after that.
p220
aVThere were a couple of examples here.
p221
aVThe military fighters had a \u2014 highest-performance military airplane
p222
aVwas the SR71. It went a whole life cycle, got too rusty to fly,
p223
aVand was taken out of service. The Concorde doubled the speed for airline travel.
p224
aVIt went a whole life cycle without competition,
p225
aVtook out of service. And we're stuck back here
p226
aVwith the same kind of capability for military fighters
p227
aVand commercial airline travel that we had back in the late '50s.
p228
aa(lp229
VBut something is out there to inspire our kids now.
p230
aVAnd I'm talking about if you've got a baby now,
p231
aVor if you've got a 10-year-old now.
p232
aVWhat's out there is there's something really interesting going to happen here.
p233
aVRelatively soon, you'll be able to buy a ticket
p234
aVand fly higher and faster than the highest-performance
p235
aVmilitary operational airplane. It's never happened before.
p236
aVThe fact that they have stuck here with this kind of performance
p237
aVhas been, well, you know, you win the war in 12 minutes;
p238
aVwhy do you need something better?
p239
aVBut I think when you guys start buying tickets and flying
p240
aVsub-orbital flights to space, very soon \u2014 wait a minute,
p241
aVwhat's happening here, we'll have military fighters
p242
aVwith sub-orbital capability, and I think very soon this.
p243
aVBut the interesting thing about it is the commercial guys are going to go first.
p244
aVOK, I look forward to a new "capitalist's space race," let's call it.
p245
aa(lp246
VYou remember the space race in the '60s was for national prestige,
p247
aVbecause we lost the first two milestones.
p248
aVWe didn't lose them technically. The fact that we had the hardware
p249
aVto put something in orbit when we let Von Braun fly it \u2014
p250
aVyou can argue that's not a technical loss.
p251
aVSputnik wasn't a technical loss, but it was a prestige loss.
p252
aVAmerica \u2014 the world saw America as not being the leader in technology,
p253
aVand that was a very strong thing.
p254
aVAnd then we flew Alan Shepherd weeks after Gagarin,
p255
aVnot months or decades, or whatever. So we had the capability.
p256
aVBut America lost. We lost. And because of that, we made a big jump to recover it.
p257
aa(lp258
VWell, again, what's interesting here is we've lost
p259
aVto the Russians on the first couple of milestones already.
p260
aVYou cannot buy a ticket commercially to fly into space in America \u2014
p261
aVcan't do it. You can buy it in Russia.
p262
aVYou can fly with Russian hardware. This is available
p263
aVbecause a Russian space program is starving,
p264
aVand it's nice for them to get 20 million here and there to take one of the seats.
p265
aVIt's commercial. It can be defined as space tourism. They are also offering a trip
p266
aVto go on this whip around the moon, like Apollo 8 was done.
p267
aV100 million bucks \u2014 hey, I can go to the moon.
p268
aVBut, you know, would you have thought back in the '60s,
p269
aVwhen the space race was going on,
p270
aVthat the first commercial capitalist-like thing to do
p271
aVto buy a ticket to go to the moon would be in Russian hardware?
p272
aVAnd would you have thought, would the Russians have thought,
p273
aVthat when they first go to the moon in their developed hardware,
p274
aVthe guys inside won't be Russians? Maybe it'll probably be a Japanese
p275
aVor an American billionaire? Well, that's weird: you know, it really is.
p276
aVBut anyway, I think we need to beat them again.
p277
aa(lp278
VI think what we'll do is we'll see a successful, very successful,
p279
aVprivate space flight industry. Whether we're first or not really doesn't matter.
p280
aVThe Russians actually flew a supersonic transport before the Concorde.
p281
aVAnd then they flew a few cargo flights, and took it out of service.
p282
aVI think you kind of see the same kind of parallel
p283
aVwhen the commercial stuff is offered.
p284
aa(lp285
VOK, we'll talk just a little bit about commercial development for human space flight.
p286
aVThis little thing says here: five times
p287
aVwhat NASA's doing by 2020. I want to tell you, already
p288
aVthere's about 1.5 billion to 1.7 billion
p289
aVinvestment in private space flight that is not government at all \u2014
p290
aValready, worldwide. If you read \u2014 if you Google it,
p291
aVyou'll find about half of that money, but there's twice of that
p292
aVbeing committed out there \u2014 not spent yet, but being committed
p293
aVand planned for the next few years. Hey, that's pretty big.
p294
aVI'm predicting, though, as profitable as this industry is going to be \u2014
p295
aVand it certainly is profitable when you fly people at 200,000 dollars
p296
aVon something that you can actually operate at a tenth of that cost,
p297
aVor less \u2014 this is going to be very profitable.
p298
aVI predict, also, that the investment that will flow into this
p299
aVwill be somewhere around half of what the U.S. taxpayer
p300
aVspends for NASA's manned spacecraft work.
p301
aVAnd every dollar that flows into that will be spent more efficiently
p302
aVby a factor of 10 to 15. And what that means is before we know it,
p303
aVthe progress in human space flight, with no taxpayer dollars,
p304
aVwill be at a level of about five times as much
p305
aVas the current NASA budgets for human space flight.
p306
aVAnd that is because it's us. It's private industry.
p307
aVYou should never depend on the government to do this sort of stuff \u2014
p308
aVand we've done it for a long time. The NACA, before NASA,
p309
aVnever developed an airliner and never ran an airline.
p310
aVBut NASA is developing the space liner, always has,
p311
aVand runs the only space line, OK. And we've shied away from it
p312
aVbecause we're afraid of it. But starting back in June of 2004,
p313
aVwhen I showed that a little group out there actually can do it,
p314
aVcan get a start with it, everything changed after that time.
