VSo there are a few things
p4
aVthat bring us humans together in the way that an election does.
p5
aVWe stand in elections; we vote in elections;
p6
aVwe observe elections.
p7
aVOur democracies rely on elections.
p8
aVWe all understand why we have elections,
p9
aVand we all leave the house on the same day
p10
aVto go and vote.
p11
aVWe cherish the opportunity to have our say,
p12
aVto help decide the future of the country.
p13
aVThe fundamental idea is that politicians
p14
aVare given mandate to speak for us,
p15
aVto make decisions on our behalf
p16
aVthat affect us all.
p17
aVWithout that mandate, they would be corrupt.
p18
aa(lp19
VWell unfortunately, power corrupts,
p20
aVand so people will do lots of things
p21
aVto get power and to stay in power,
p22
aVincluding doing bad things to elections.
p23
aVYou see, even if the idea
p24
aVof the election is perfect,
p25
aVrunning a countrywide election is a big project,
p26
aVand big projects are messy.
p27
aVWhenever there is an election,
p28
aVit seems like something always goes wrong,
p29
aVsomeone tries to cheat,
p30
aVor something goes accidentally awry \u2014
p31
aVa ballot box goes missing here,
p32
aVchads are left hanging over here.
p33
aa(lp34
VTo make sure as few things as possible go wrong,
p35
aVwe have all these procedures around the election.
p36
aVSo for example, you come to the polling station,
p37
aVand a poll station worker asks for your ID
p38
aVbefore giving you a ballot form
p39
aVand asking you to go into a voting booth
p40
aVto fill out your vote.
p41
aVWhen you come back out, you get to drop your vote
p42
aVinto the ballot box
p43
aVwhere it mixes with all the other votes,
p44
aVso that no one knows how you voted.
p45
aa(lp46
VWell, what I want us to think about for a moment
p47
aVis what happens after that,
p48
aVafter you drop your vote into the ballot box.
p49
aVAnd most people would go home
p50
aVand feel sure that their vote has been counted,
p51
aVbecause they trust
p52
aVthat the election system works.
p53
aVThey trust that election workers and election observers
p54
aVdo their jobs and do their jobs correctly.
p55
aVThe ballot boxes go to counting places.
p56
aVThey're unsealed and the votes are poured out
p57
aVand laboriously counted.
p58
aVMost of us have to trust
p59
aVthat that happens correctly for our own vote,
p60
aVand we all have to trust that that happens correctly
p61
aVfor all the votes in the election.
p62
aVSo we have to trust a lot of people.
p63
aVWe have to trust a lot of procedures.
p64
aVAnd sometimes we even have to trust computers.
p65
aVSo imagine hundreds of millions of voters
p66
aVcasting hundreds of millions of votes,
p67
aVall to be counted correctly
p68
aVand all the things that can possibly go wrong
p69
aVcausing all these bad headlines,
p70
aVand you cannot help but feel exhausted at the idea
p71
aVof trying to make elections better.
p72
aa(lp73
VWell in the face of all these bad headlines,
p74
aVresearchers have taken a step back
p75
aVand thought about how we can do elections differently.
p76
aVThey've zoomed out and looked at the big picture.
p77
aVAnd the big picture is this:
p78
aVelections should be verifiable.
p79
aVVoters should be able to check
p80
aVthat their votes are counted correctly,
p81
aVwithout breaking election secrecy,
p82
aVwhich is so very important.
p83
aVAnd that's the tough part.
p84
aVHow do we make an election system completely verifiable
p85
aVwhile keeping the votes
p86
aVabsolutely secret?
p87
aa(lp88
VWell, the way we've come up with
p89
aVuses computers
p90
aVbut doesn't depend on them.
p91
aVAnd the secret is the ballot form.
p92
aVAnd if you look closely at these ballot forms,
p93
aVyou'll notice that the candidate list
p94
aVis in a different order on each one.
p95
aVAnd that means, if you mark your choices on one of them
p96
aVand then remove the candidate list,
p97
aVI won't be able to tell from the bit remaining
p98
aVwhat your vote is for.
p99
aVAnd on each ballot form there is this encrypted value
p100
aVin the form of this 2D barcode
p101
aVon the right.
p102
aVAnd there's some complicated cryptography
p103
aVgoing on in there,
p104
aVbut what's not complicated
p105
aVis voting with one of these forms.
p106
aVSo we can let computers do all the complicated cryptography for us,
p107
aVand then we'll use the paper for verification.
p108
aa(lp109
VSo this is how you vote.
p110
aVYou get one of these ballot forms at random,
p111
aVand then you go into the voting booth,
p112
aVand you mark your choices,
p113
aVand you tear along a perforation.
p114
aVAnd you shred the candidate list.
p115
aVAnd the bit that remains, the one with your marks \u2014
p116
aVthis is your encrypted vote.
p117
aVSo you let a poll station worker
p118
aVscan your encrypted vote.
p119
aVAnd because it's encrypted,
p120
aVit can be submitted, stored
p121
aVand counted centrally
p122
aVand displayed on a website
p123
aVfor anyone to see, including you.
p124
aVSo you take this encrypted vote
p125
aVhome as your receipt.
p126
aVAnd after the close of the election,
p127
aVyou can check that your vote was counted
p128
aVby comparing your receipt
p129
aVto the vote on the website.
p130
aVAnd remember, the vote is encrypted
p131
aVfrom the moment you leave the voting booth,
p132
aVso if an election official wants to find out how you voted,
p133
aVthey will not be able to.
p134
aVIf the government wants to find out how you voted,
p135
aVthey won't be able to.
p136
aVNo hacker can break in
p137
aVand find out how you voted.
p138
aVNo hacker can break in and change your vote,
p139
aVbecause then it won't match your receipt.
p140
aVVotes can't go missing
p141
aVbecause then you won't find yours when you look for it.
p142
aa(lp143
VBut the election magic doesn't stop there.
p144
aVInstead, we want to make the whole process
p145
aVso transparent
p146
aVthat news media and international observers
p147
aVand anyone who wants to
p148
aVcan download all the election data
p149
aVand do the count themselves.
p150
aVThey can check that all the votes were counted correctly.
p151
aVThey can check
p152
aVthat the announced result of the election
p153
aVis the correct one.
p154
aVAnd these are elections
p155
aVby the people, for the people.
p156
aVSo the next step for our democracies
p157
aVare transparent
p158
aVand verifiable elections.
p159
