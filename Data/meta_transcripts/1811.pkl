VAh yes, those university days,
p4
aVa heady mix of Ph.D-level pure mathematics
p5
aVand world debating championships,
p6
aVor, as I like to say, "Hello, ladies. Oh yeah."
p7
aVDidn't get much sexier than the Spence
p8
aVat university, let me tell you.
p9
aa(lp10
VIt is such a thrill for a humble breakfast radio announcer
p11
aVfrom Sydney, Australia, to be here on the TED stage
p12
aVliterally on the other side of the world.
p13
aVAnd I wanted to let you know, a lot of the things you've heard
p14
aVabout Australians are true.
p15
aVFrom the youngest of ages, we display
p16
aVa prodigious sporting talent.
p17
aVOn the field of battle, we are brave and noble warriors.
p18
aVWhat you've heard is true.
p19
aVAustralians, we don't mind a bit of a drink,
p20
aVsometimes to excess, leading to embarrassing social situations. (Laughter)
p21
aVThis is my father's work Christmas party, December 1973.
p22
aVI'm almost five years old. Fair to say,
p23
aVI'm enjoying the day a lot more than Santa was.
p24
aa(lp25
VBut I stand before you today
p26
aVnot as a breakfast radio host,
p27
aVnot as a comedian, but as someone who was, is,
p28
aVand always will be a mathematician.
p29
aVAnd anyone who's been bitten by the numbers bug
p30
aVknows that it bites early and it bites deep.
p31
aa(lp32
VI cast my mind back when I was in second grade
p33
aVat a beautiful little government-run school
p34
aVcalled Boronia Park in the suburbs of Sydney,
p35
aVand as we came up towards lunchtime, our teacher,
p36
aVMs. Russell, said to the class,
p37
aV"Hey, year two. What do you want to do after lunch?
p38
aVI've got no plans."
p39
aVIt was an exercise in democratic schooling,
p40
aVand I am all for democratic schooling, but we were only seven.
p41
aVSo some of the suggestions we made as to what
p42
aVwe might want to do after lunch were a little bit impractical,
p43
aVand after a while, someone made a particularly silly suggestion
p44
aVand Ms. Russell patted them down with that gentle aphorism,
p45
aV"That wouldn't work.
p46
aVThat'd be like trying to put a square peg through a round hole."
p47
aa(lp48
VNow I wasn't trying to be smart.
p49
aVI wasn't trying to be funny.
p50
aVI just politely raised my hand,
p51
aVand when Ms. Russell acknowledged me, I said,
p52
aVin front of my year two classmates, and I quote,
p53
aV"But Miss,
p54
aVsurely if the diagonal of the square
p55
aVis less than the diameter of the circle,
p56
aVwell, the square peg will pass quite easily through the round hole."
p57
aV(Laughter)
p58
aV"It'd be like putting a piece of toast through a basketball hoop, wouldn't it?"
p59
aa(lp60
VAnd there was that same awkward silence
p61
aVfrom most of my classmates,
p62
aVuntil sitting next to me, one of my friends,
p63
aVone of the cool kids in class, Steven, leaned across
p64
aVand punched me really hard in the head.
p65
aV(Laughter)
p66
aVNow what Steven was saying was, "Look, Adam,
p67
aVyou are at a critical juncture in your life here, my friend.
p68
aVYou can keep sitting here with us.
p69
aVAny more of that sort of talk, you've got to go and sit
p70
aVover there with them."
p71
aa(lp72
VI thought about it for a nanosecond.
p73
aVI took one look at the road map of life,
p74
aVand I ran off down the street marked "Geek"
p75
aVas fast as my chubby, asthmatic little legs would carry me.
p76
aa(lp77
VI fell in love with mathematics from the earliest of ages.
p78
aVI explained it to all my friends. Maths is beautiful.
p79
aVIt's natural. It's everywhere.
p80
aVNumbers are the musical notes
p81
aVwith which the symphony of the universe is written.
p82
aVThe great Descartes said something quite similar.
p83
aVThe universe "is written in the mathematical language."
p84
aVAnd today, I want to show you one of those musical notes,
p85
aVa number so beautiful, so massive,
p86
aVI think it will blow your mind.
p87
aa(lp88
VToday we're going to talk about prime numbers.
p89
aVMost of you I'm sure remember that six is not prime
p90
aVbecause it's 2 x 3.
p91
aVSeven is prime because it's 1 x 7,
p92
aVbut we can't break it down into any smaller chunks,
p93
aVor as we call them, factors.
p94
aVNow a few things you might like to know about prime numbers.
p95
aVOne is not prime.
p96
aVThe proof of that is a great party trick
p97
aVthat admittedly only works at certain parties.
p98
aa(lp99
V(Laughter)
p100
aa(lp101
VAnother thing about primes, there is no final biggest prime number.
p102
aVThey keep going on forever.
p103
aVWe know there are an infinite number of primes
p104
aVdue to the brilliant mathematician Euclid.
p105
aVOver thousands of years ago, he proved that for us.
p106
aVBut the third thing about prime numbers,
p107
aVmathematicians have always wondered,
p108
aVwell at any given moment in time,
p109
aVwhat is the biggest prime that we know about?
p110
aa(lp111
VToday we're going to hunt for that massive prime.
p112
aVDon't freak out.
p113
aVAll you need to know, of all the mathematics
p114
aVyou've ever learned, unlearned, crammed, forgotten,
p115
aVnever understood in the first place,
p116
aVall you need to know is this:
p117
aVWhen I say 2 ^ 5,
p118
aVI'm talking about five little number twos next to each other
p119
aVall multiplied together,
p120
aV2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2.
p121
aVSo 2 ^ 5 is 2 x 2 = 4,
p122
aV8, 16, 32.
p123
aVIf you've got that, you're with me for the entire journey. Okay?
p124
aVSo 2 ^ 5,
p125
aVthose five little twos multiplied together.
p126
aV(2 ^ 5) - 1 = 31.
p127
aV31 is a prime number, and that five in the power
p128
aVis also a prime number.
p129
aVAnd the vast bulk of massive primes we've ever found
p130
aVare of that form:
p131
aVtwo to a prime number, take away one.
p132
aVI won't go into great detail as to why,
p133
aVbecause most of your eyes will bleed out of your head if I do,
p134
aVbut suffice to say, a number of that form
p135
aVis fairly easy to test for primacy.
p136
aVA random odd number is a lot harder to test.
p137
aVBut as soon as we go hunting for massive primes,
p138
aVwe realize it's not enough
p139
aVjust to put in any prime number in the power.
p140
aV(2 ^ 11) - 1 = 2,047,
p141
aVand you don't need me to tell you that's 23 x 89.
p142
aV(Laughter)
p143
aVBut (2 ^ 13) - 1, (2 ^ 17) - 1
p144
aV(2 ^ 19) - 1, are all prime numbers.
p145
aVAfter that point, they thin out a lot.
p146
aa(lp147
VAnd one of the things about the search for massive primes
p148
aVthat I love so much is some of the great mathematical minds
p149
aVof all time have gone on this search.
p150
aVThis is the great Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler.
p151
aVIn the 1700s, other mathematicians said
p152
aVhe is simply the master of us all.
p153
aVHe was so respected, they put him on European currency
p154
aVback when that was a compliment.
p155
aa(lp156
V(Laughter)
p157
aa(lp158
VEuler discovered at the time the world's biggest prime:
p159
aV(2 ^ 31) - 1.
p160
aVIt's over two billion.
p161
aVHe proved it was prime with nothing more
p162
aVthan a quill, ink, paper and his mind.
p163
aa(lp164
VYou think that's big.
p165
aVWe know that (2 ^ 127) - 1
p166
aVis a prime number.
p167
aVIt's an absolute brute.
p168
aVLook at it here: 39 digits long,
p169
aVproven to be prime in 1876
p170
aVby a mathematician called Lucas.
p171
aVWord up, L-Dog.
p172
aa(lp173
V(Laughter)
p174
aa(lp175
VBut one of the great things about the search for massive primes,
p176
aVit's not just finding the primes.
p177
aVSometimes proving another number not to be prime is just as exciting.
p178
aVLucas again, in 1876, showed us (2 ^ 67) - 1,
p179
aV21 digits long, was not prime.
p180
aVBut he didn't know what the factors were.
p181
aVWe knew it was like six, but we didn't know
p182
aVwhat are the 2 x 3 that multiply together
p183
aVto give us that massive number.
p184
aa(lp185
VWe didn't know for almost 40 years
p186
aVuntil Frank Nelson Cole came along.
p187
aVAnd at a gathering of prestigious American mathematicians,
p188
aVhe walked to the board, took up a piece of chalk,
p189
aVand started writing out the powers of two:
p190
aVtwo, four, eight, 16 \u2014
p191
aVcome on, join in with me, you know how it goes \u2014
p192
aV32, 64, 128, 256,
p193
aV512, 1,024, 2,048.
p194
aVI'm in geek heaven. We'll stop it there for a second.
p195
aVFrank Nelson Cole did not stop there.
p196
aVHe went on and on
p197
aVand calculated 67 powers of two.
p198
aVHe took away one and wrote that number on the board.
p199
aVA frisson of excitement went around the room.
p200
aVIt got even more exciting when he then wrote down
p201
aVthese two large prime numbers in your standard multiplication format \u2014
p202
aVand for the rest of the hour of his talk
p203
aVFrank Nelson Cole busted that out.
p204
aVHe had found the prime factors
p205
aVof (2 ^ 67) - 1.
p206
aVThe room went berserk \u2014
p207
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p208
aVas Frank Nelson Cole sat down,
p209
aVhaving delivered the only talk in the history of mathematics
p210
aVwith no words.
p211
aVHe admitted afterwards it wasn't that hard to do.
p212
aVIt took focus. It took dedication.
p213
aVIt took him, by his estimate,
p214
aV"three years of Sundays."
p215
aa(lp216
VBut then in the field of mathematics,
p217
aVas in so many of the fields that we've heard from in this TED,
p218
aVthe age of the computer goes along and things explode.
p219
aVThese are the largest prime numbers we knew
p220
aVdecade by decade, each one dwarfing the one before
p221
aVas computers took over and our power to calculate
p222
aVjust grew and grew.
p223
aa(lp224
VThis is the largest prime number we knew in 1996,
p225
aVa very emotional year for me.
p226
aVIt was the year I left university.
p227
aVI was torn between mathematics and media.
p228
aVIt was a tough decision. I loved university.
p229
aVMy arts degree was the best nine and a half years of my life.
p230
aa(lp231
V(Laughter)
p232
aa(lp233
VBut I came to a realization about my own ability.
p234
aVPut simply, in a room full of randomly selected people,
p235
aVI'm a maths genius.
p236
aVIn a roomful of maths Ph.Ds,
p237
aVI'm as dumb as a box of hammers.
p238
aVMy skill is not in the mathematics.
p239
aVIt is in telling the story of the mathematics.
p240
aa(lp241
VAnd during that time, since I've left university,
p242
aVthese numbers have got bigger and bigger,
p243
aVeach one dwarfing the last,
p244
aVuntil along came this man, Dr. Curtis Cooper,
p245
aVwho a few years ago held the record for the largest ever prime,
p246
aVonly to see it snatched away by a rival university.
p247
aVAnd then Curtis Cooper got it back.
p248
aVNot years ago, not months ago, days ago.
p249
aVIn an amazing moment of serendipity,
p250
aVI had to send TED a new slide
p251
aVto show you what this guy had done.
p252
aa(lp253
VI still remember \u2014 (Applause) \u2014
p254
aVI still remember when it happened.
p255
aVI was doing my breakfast radio show.
p256
aVI looked down on Twitter. There was a tweet:
p257
aV"Adam, have you seen the new largest prime number?"
p258
aVI shivered \u2014
p259
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p260
aVcontacted the women who produced my radio show out in the other room,
p261
aVand said "Girls, hold the front page.
p262
aVWe're not talking politics today.
p263
aVWe're not talking sport today.
p264
aVThey found another megaprime."
p265
aVThe girls just shook their heads,
p266
aVput them in their hands, and let me go my own way.
p267
aa(lp268
VIt's because of Curtis Cooper that we know,
p269
aVcurrently the largest prime number we know,
p270
aVis 2 ^ 57,885,161.
p271
aVDon't forget to subtract the one.
p272
aVThis number is almost 17 and a half million digits long.
p273
aVIf you typed it out on a computer and saved it as a text file,
p274
aVthat's 22 meg.
p275
aVFor the slightly less geeky of you,
p276
aVthink about the Harry Potter novels, okay?
p277
aVThis is the first Harry Potter novel.
p278
aVThis is all seven Harry Potter novels,
p279
aVbecause she did tend to faff on a bit near the end.
p280
aV(Laughter)
p281
aVWritten out as a book, this number would run
p282
aVthe length of the Harry Potter novels and half again.
p283
aVHere's a slide of the first 1,000 digits of this prime.
p284
aVIf, when TED had begun, at 11 o'clock on Tuesday,
p285
aVwe'd walked out and simply hit one slide every second,
p286
aVit would have taken five hours to show you that number.
p287
aVI was keen to do it, could not convince Bono.
p288
aVThat's the way it goes.
p289
aa(lp290
VThis number is 17 and a half thousand slides long,
p291
aVand we know it is prime as confidently
p292
aVas we know the number seven is prime.
p293
aVThat fills me with almost sexual excitement.
p294
aVAnd who am I kidding when I say almost?
p295
aa(lp296
V(Laughter)
p297
aa(lp298
VI know what you're thinking:
p299
aVAdam, we're happy that you're happy,
p300
aVbut why should we care?
p301
aVLet me give you just three reasons why this is so beautiful.
p302
aa(lp303
VFirst of all, as I explained, to ask a computer
p304
aV"Is that number prime?" to type it in its abbreviated form,
p305
aVand then only about six lines of code is the test for primacy,
p306
aVis a remarkably simple question to ask.
p307
aVIt's got a remarkably clear yes/no answer,
p308
aVand just requires phenomenal grunt.
p309
aVLarge prime numbers are a great way of testing
p310
aVthe speed and accuracy of computer chips.
p311
aa(lp312
VBut secondly, as Curtis Cooper was looking for that monster prime,
p313
aVhe wasn't the only guy searching.
p314
aVMy laptop at home was looking through
p315
aVfour potential candidate primes myself
p316
aVas part of a networked computer hunt around the world
p317
aVfor these large numbers.
p318
aVThe discovery of that prime is similar to the work
p319
aVpeople are doing in unraveling RNA sequences,
p320
aVin searching through data from SETI and other astronomical projects.
p321
aVWe live in an age where some of the great breakthroughs
p322
aVare not going to happen in the labs or the halls of academia
p323
aVbut on laptops, desktops,
p324
aVin the palms of people's hands
p325
aVwho are simply helping out for the search.
p326
aa(lp327
VBut for me it's amazing because it's a metaphor
p328
aVfor the time in which we live,
p329
aVwhen human minds and machines can conquer together.
p330
aVWe've heard a lot about robots in this TED.
p331
aVWe've heard a lot about what they can and can't do.
p332
aVIt is true, you can now download onto your smartphone
p333
aVan app that would beat most grandmasters at chess.
p334
aa(lp335
VYou think that's cool.
p336
aVHere's a machine doing something cool.
p337
aVThis is the CubeStormer II.
p338
aVIt can take a randomly shuffled Rubik's Cube.
p339
aVUsing the power of the smartphone,
p340
aVit can examine the cube and solve the cube
p341
aVin five seconds.
p342
aa(lp343
V(Applause)
p344
aa(lp345
VThat scares some people. That excites me.
p346
aVHow lucky are we to live in this age
p347
aVwhen mind and machine can work together?
p348
aa(lp349
VI was asked in an interview last year in my capacity
p350
aVas a lower-case "c" celebrity in Australia,
p351
aV"What was your highlight of 2012?"
p352
aVPeople were expecting me to talk about
p353
aVmy beloved Sydney Swans football team.
p354
aVIn our beautiful, indigenous sport of Australian football,
p355
aVthey won the equivalent of the Super Bowl.
p356
aVI was there. It was the most emotional, exciting day.
p357
aVIt wasn't my highlight of 2012.
p358
aVPeople thought it might have been an interview I'd done on my show.
p359
aVIt might have been a politician. It might have been a breakthrough.
p360
aVIt might have been a book I read, the arts. No, no, no.
p361
aVIt might have been something my two gorgeous daughters had done.
p362
aVNo, it wasn't. The highlight of 2012, so clearly,
p363
aVwas the discovery of the Higgs boson.
p364
aVGive it up for the fundamental particle
p365
aVthat bequeaths all other fundamental particles their mass.
p366
aa(lp367
V(Applause)
p368
aa(lp369
VAnd what was so gorgeous about this discovery was
p370
aV50 years ago Peter Higgs and his team
p371
aVconsidered one of the deepest of all questions:
p372
aVHow is it that the things that make us up have no mass?
p373
aVI've clearly got mass. Where does it come from?
p374
aVAnd he postulated a suggestion
p375
aVthat there's this infinite, incredibly small field
p376
aVstretching throughout the universe,
p377
aVand as other particles go through those particles
p378
aVand interact, that's where they get their mass.
p379
aVThe rest of the scientific community said,
p380
aV"Great idea, Higgsy.
p381
aVWe've got no idea if we could ever prove it.
p382
aVIt's beyond our reach."
p383
aVAnd within just 50 years,
p384
aVin his lifetime, with him sitting in the audience,
p385
aVwe had designed the greatest machine ever
p386
aVto prove this incredible idea
p387
aVthat originated just in a human mind.
p388
aa(lp389
VThat's what is so exciting for me about this prime number.
p390
aVWe thought it might be there,
p391
aVand we went and found it.
p392
aVThat is the essence of being human.
p393
aVThat is what we are all about.
p394
aVOr as my friend Descartes might put it,
p395
aVwe think,
p396
aVtherefore we are.
p397
