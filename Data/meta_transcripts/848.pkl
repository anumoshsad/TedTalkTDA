VHow do you explain when things don't go as we assume?
p4
aVOr better, how do you explain
p5
aVwhen others are able to achieve things that seem to defy all of the assumptions?
p6
aVFor example:
p7
aVWhy is Apple so innovative?
p8
aVYear after year, after year,
p9
aVthey're more innovative than all their competition.
p10
aVAnd yet, they're just a computer company.
p11
aVThey're just like everyone else.
p12
aVThey have the same access to the same talent,
p13
aVthe same agencies,
p14
aVthe same consultants, the same media.
p15
aVThen why is it that they seem to have something different?
p16
aVWhy is it that Martin Luther King led the Civil Rights Movement?
p17
aVHe wasn't the only man who suffered in pre-civil rights America,
p18
aVand he certainly wasn't the only great orator of the day.
p19
aVWhy him?
p20
aVAnd why is it that the Wright brothers
p21
aVwere able to figure out controlled, powered man flight
p22
aVwhen there were certainly other teams
p23
aVwho were better qualified, better funded \u2014
p24
aVand they didn't achieve powered man flight,
p25
aVand the Wright brothers beat them to it.
p26
aVThere's something else at play here.
p27
aa(lp28
VAbout three and a half years ago, I made a discovery.
p29
aVAnd this discovery profoundly changed my view on how I thought the world worked,
p30
aVand it even profoundly changed the way in which I operate in it.
p31
aVAs it turns out, there's a pattern.
p32
aVAs it turns out, all the great inspiring leaders and organizations in the world,
p33
aVwhether it's Apple or Martin Luther King or the Wright brothers,
p34
aVthey all think, act and communicate the exact same way.
p35
aVAnd it's the complete opposite to everyone else.
p36
aVAll I did was codify it,
p37
aVand it's probably the world's simplest idea.
p38
aVI call it the golden circle.
p39
aa(lp40
VWhy? How? What?
p41
aVThis little idea explains
p42
aVwhy some organizations and some leaders are able to inspire where others aren't.
p43
aVLet me define the terms really quickly.
p44
aVEvery single person, every single organization on the planet
p45
aVknows what they do, 100 percent.
p46
aVSome know how they do it,
p47
aVwhether you call it your differentiated value proposition
p48
aVor your proprietary process or your USP.
p49
aVBut very, very few people or organizations know why they do what they do.
p50
aVAnd by "why" I don't mean "to make a profit."
p51
aVThat's a result. It's always a result.
p52
aVBy "why," I mean: What's your purpose?
p53
aVWhat's your cause? What's your belief?
p54
aVWhy does your organization exist?
p55
aVWhy do you get out of bed in the morning?
p56
aVAnd why should anyone care?
p57
aVAs a result, the way we think, we act,
p58
aVthe way we communicate is from the outside in, it's obvious.
p59
aVWe go from the clearest thing to the fuzziest thing.
p60
aVBut the inspired leaders and the inspired organizations \u2014
p61
aVregardless of their size, regardless of their industry \u2014
p62
aVall think, act and communicate from the inside out.
p63
aa(lp64
VLet me give you an example.
p65
aVI use Apple because they're easy to understand and everybody gets it.
p66
aVIf Apple were like everyone else,
p67
aVa marketing message from them might sound like this:
p68
aV"We make great computers.
p69
aVThey're beautifully designed, simple to use and user friendly.
p70
aVWant to buy one?"
p71
aV"Meh."
p72
aVThat's how most of us communicate.
p73
aVThat's how most marketing and sales are done,
p74
aVthat's how we communicate interpersonally.
p75
aVWe say what we do,
p76
aVwe say how we're different or better
p77
aVand we expect some sort of a behavior,
p78
aVa purchase, a vote, something like that.
p79
aVHere's our new law firm:
p80
aVWe have the best lawyers with the biggest clients,
p81
aVwe always perform for our clients.
p82
aVHere's our new car:
p83
aVIt gets great gas mileage, it has leather seats.
p84
aVBuy our car.
p85
aVBut it's uninspiring.
p86
aa(lp87
VHere's how Apple actually communicates.
p88
aV"Everything we do, we believe in challenging the status quo.
p89
aVWe believe in thinking differently.
p90
aVThe way we challenge the status quo
p91
aVis by making our products beautifully designed,
p92
aVsimple to use and user friendly.
p93
aVWe just happen to make great computers.
p94
aVWant to buy one?"
p95
aVTotally different, right?
p96
aVYou're ready to buy a computer from me.
p97
aVI just reversed the order of the information.
p98
aVWhat it proves to us is that people don't buy what you do;
p99
aVpeople buy why you do it.
p100
aa(lp101
VThis explains why every single person in this room
p102
aVis perfectly comfortable buying a computer from Apple.
p103
aVBut we're also perfectly comfortable
p104
aVbuying an MP3 player from Apple, or a phone from Apple,
p105
aVor a DVR from Apple.
p106
aVAs I said before, Apple's just a computer company.
p107
aVNothing distinguishes them structurally from any of their competitors.
p108
aVTheir competitors are equally qualified to make all of these products.
p109
aVIn fact, they tried.
p110
aVA few years ago, Gateway came out with flat-screen TVs.
p111
aVThey're eminently qualified to make flat-screen TVs.
p112
aVThey've been making flat-screen monitors for years.
p113
aVNobody bought one.
p114
aVDell came out with MP3 players and PDAs,
p115
aVand they make great quality products,
p116
aVand they can make perfectly well-designed products \u2014
p117
aVand nobody bought one.
p118
aVIn fact, talking about it now, we can't even imagine
p119
aVbuying an MP3 player from Dell.
p120
aVWhy would you buy one from a computer company?
p121
aVBut we do it every day.
p122
aVPeople don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it.
p123
aVThe goal is not to do business with everybody who needs what you have.
p124
aVThe goal is to do business with people who believe what you believe.
p125
aa(lp126
VHere's the best part:
p127
aVNone of what I'm telling you is my opinion.
p128
aVIt's all grounded in the tenets of biology.
p129
aVNot psychology, biology.
p130
aVIf you look at a cross-section of the human brain,
p131
aVfrom the top down, the human brain is actually broken
p132
aVinto three major components
p133
aVthat correlate perfectly with the golden circle.
p134
aVOur newest brain, our Homo sapien brain,
p135
aVour neocortex,
p136
aVcorresponds with the "what" level.
p137
aVThe neocortex is responsible
p138
aVfor all of our rational and analytical thought and language.
p139
aVThe middle two sections make up our limbic brains,
p140
aVand our limbic brains are responsible for all of our feelings,
p141
aVlike trust and loyalty.
p142
aVIt's also responsible for all human behavior,
p143
aVall decision-making,
p144
aVand it has no capacity for language.
p145
aa(lp146
VIn other words, when we communicate from the outside in,
p147
aVyes, people can understand vast amounts of complicated information
p148
aVlike features and benefits and facts and figures.
p149
aVIt just doesn't drive behavior.
p150
aVWhen we can communicate from the inside out,
p151
aVwe're talking directly to the part of the brain
p152
aVthat controls behavior,
p153
aVand then we allow people to rationalize it with the tangible things we say and do.
p154
aVThis is where gut decisions come from.
p155
aVSometimes you can give somebody all the facts and figures,
p156
aVand they say, "I know what all the facts and details say,
p157
aVbut it just doesn't feel right."
p158
aVWhy would we use that verb, it doesn't "feel" right?
p159
aVBecause the part of the brain that controls decision-making
p160
aVdoesn't control language.
p161
aVThe best we can muster up is,
p162
aV"I don't know.  It just doesn't feel right."
p163
aVOr sometimes you say you're leading with your heart or soul.
p164
aVI hate to break it to you, those aren't other body parts
p165
aVcontrolling your behavior.
p166
aVIt's all happening here in your limbic brain,
p167
aVthe part of the brain that controls decision-making and not language.
p168
aa(lp169
VBut if you don't know why you do what you do,
p170
aVand people respond to why you do what you do,
p171
aVthen how will you ever get people
p172
aVto vote for you, or buy something from you,
p173
aVor, more importantly, be loyal
p174
aVand want to be a part of what it is that you do.
p175
aVThe goal is not just to sell to people who need what you have;
p176
aVthe goal is to sell to people who believe what you believe.
p177
aVThe goal is not just to hire people who need a job;
p178
aVit's to hire people who believe what you believe.
p179
aVI always say that, you know,
p180
aVif you hire people just because they can do a job, they'll work for your money,
p181
aVbut if they believe what you believe,
p182
aVthey'll work for you with blood and sweat and tears.
p183
aVNowhere else is there a better example than with the Wright brothers.
p184
aa(lp185
VMost people don't know about Samuel Pierpont Langley.
p186
aVAnd back in the early 20th century,
p187
aVthe pursuit of powered man flight was like the dot com of the day.
p188
aVEverybody was trying it.
p189
aVAnd Samuel Pierpont Langley had, what we assume,
p190
aVto be the recipe for success.
p191
aVEven now, you ask people,
p192
aV"Why did your product or why did your company fail?"
p193
aVand people always give you the same permutation
p194
aVof the same three things:
p195
aVunder-capitalized, the wrong people, bad market conditions.
p196
aVIt's always the same three things, so let's explore that.
p197
aVSamuel Pierpont Langley
p198
aVwas given 50,000 dollars by the War Department
p199
aVto figure out this flying machine.
p200
aVMoney was no problem.
p201
aVHe held a seat at Harvard
p202
aVand worked at the Smithsonian and was extremely well-connected;
p203
aVhe knew all the big minds of the day.
p204
aVHe hired the best minds money could find
p205
aVand the market conditions were fantastic.
p206
aVThe New York Times followed him around everywhere,
p207
aVand everyone was rooting for Langley.
p208
aVThen how come we've never heard of Samuel Pierpont Langley?
p209
aa(lp210
VA few hundred miles away in Dayton, Ohio,
p211
aVOrville and Wilbur Wright,
p212
aVthey had none of what we consider to be the recipe for success.
p213
aVThey had no money;
p214
aVthey paid for their dream with the proceeds from their bicycle shop.
p215
aVNot a single person on the Wright brothers' team
p216
aVhad a college education,
p217
aVnot even Orville or Wilbur.
p218
aVAnd The New York Times followed them around nowhere.
p219
aa(lp220
VThe difference was,
p221
aVOrville and Wilbur were driven by a cause, by a purpose, by a belief.
p222
aVThey believed that if they could figure out this flying machine,
p223
aVit'll change the course of the world.
p224
aVSamuel Pierpont Langley was different.
p225
aVHe wanted to be rich, and he wanted to be famous.
p226
aVHe was in pursuit of the result.
p227
aVHe was in pursuit of the riches.
p228
aVAnd lo and behold, look what happened.
p229
aVThe people who believed in the Wright brothers' dream
p230
aVworked with them with blood and sweat and tears.
p231
aVThe others just worked for the paycheck.
p232
aVThey tell stories of how every time the Wright brothers went out,
p233
aVthey would have to take five sets of parts,
p234
aVbecause that's how many times they would crash before supper.
p235
aa(lp236
VAnd, eventually, on December 17th, 1903,
p237
aVthe Wright brothers took flight,
p238
aVand no one was there to even experience it.
p239
aVWe found out about it a few days later.
p240
aVAnd further proof that Langley was motivated by the wrong thing:
p241
aVthe day the Wright brothers took flight,
p242
aVhe quit.
p243
aVHe could have said,
p244
aV"That's an amazing discovery, guys,
p245
aVand I will improve upon your technology," but he didn't.
p246
aVHe wasn't first, he didn't get rich, he didn't get famous, so he quit.
p247
aa(lp248
VPeople don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it.
p249
aVIf you talk about what you believe,
p250
aVyou will attract those who believe what you believe.
p251
aa(lp252
VBut why is it important to attract those who believe what you believe?
p253
aVSomething called the law of diffusion of innovation,
p254
aVif you don't know the law, you know the terminology.
p255
aVThe first 2.5% of our population are our innovators.
p256
aVThe next 13.5% of our population are our early adopters.
p257
aVThe next 34% are your early majority,
p258
aVyour late majority and your laggards.
p259
aVThe only reason these people buy touch-tone phones
p260
aVis because you can't buy rotary phones anymore.
p261
aa(lp262
V(Laughter)
p263
aa(lp264
VWe all sit at various places at various times on this scale,
p265
aVbut what the law of diffusion of innovation tells us
p266
aVis that if you want mass-market success or mass-market acceptance of an idea,
p267
aVyou cannot have it until you achieve this tipping point
p268
aVbetween 15 and 18 percent market penetration,
p269
aVand then the system tips.
p270
aVI love asking businesses, "What's your conversion on new business?"
p271
aVThey love to tell you, "It's about 10 percent," proudly.
p272
aVWell, you can trip over 10% of the customers.
p273
aVWe all have about 10% who just "get it."
p274
aVThat's how we describe them, right?
p275
aVThat's like that gut feeling, "Oh, they just get it."
p276
aa(lp277
VThe problem is: How do you find the ones that get it
p278
aVbefore doing business versus the ones who don't get it?
p279
aVSo it's this here, this little gap that you have to close,
p280
aVas Jeffrey Moore calls it, "Crossing the Chasm" \u2014
p281
aVbecause, you see, the early majority will not try something
p282
aVuntil someone else has tried it first.
p283
aVAnd these guys, the innovators and the early adopters,
p284
aVthey're comfortable making those gut decisions.
p285
aVThey're more comfortable making those intuitive decisions
p286
aVthat are driven by what they believe about the world
p287
aVand not just what product is available.
p288
aVThese are the people who stood in line for six hours
p289
aVto buy an iPhone when they first came out,
p290
aVwhen you could have bought one off the shelf the next week.
p291
aVThese are the people who spent 40,000 dollars
p292
aVon flat-screen TVs when they first came out,
p293
aVeven though the technology was substandard.
p294
aVAnd, by the way, they didn't do it because the technology was so great;
p295
aVthey did it for themselves.
p296
aVIt's because they wanted to be first.
p297
aVPeople don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it
p298
aVand what you do simply proves what you believe.
p299
aVIn fact, people will do the things that prove what they believe.
p300
aVThe reason that person bought the iPhone in the first six hours,
p301
aVstood in line for six hours,
p302
aVwas because of what they believed about the world,
p303
aVand how they wanted everybody to see them:
p304
aVthey were first.
p305
aVPeople don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it.
p306
aa(lp307
VSo let me give you a famous example,
p308
aVa famous failure and a famous success of the law of diffusion of innovation.
p309
aVFirst, the famous failure.
p310
aVIt's a commercial example.
p311
aVAs we said before, the recipe for success
p312
aVis money and the right people and the right market conditions.
p313
aVYou should have success then.
p314
aVLook at TiVo.
p315
aVFrom the time TiVo came out about eight or nine years ago
p316
aVto this current day,
p317
aVthey are the single highest-quality product on the market,
p318
aVhands down, there is no dispute.
p319
aVThey were extremely well-funded.
p320
aVMarket conditions were fantastic.
p321
aVI mean, we use TiVo as verb.
p322
aVI TiVo stuff on my piece-of-junk Time Warner DVR all the time.
p323
aa(lp324
V(Laughter)
p325
aa(lp326
VBut TiVo's a commercial failure.
p327
aVThey've never made money.
p328
aVAnd when they went IPO,
p329
aVtheir stock was at about 30 or 40 dollars
p330
aVand then plummeted, and it's never traded above 10.
p331
aVIn fact, I don't think it's even traded above six,
p332
aVexcept for a couple of little spikes.
p333
aa(lp334
VBecause you see, when TiVo launched their product,
p335
aVthey told us all what they had.
p336
aVThey said, "We have a product that pauses live TV,
p337
aVskips commercials, rewinds live TV and memorizes your viewing habits
p338
aVwithout you even asking."
p339
aVAnd the cynical majority said,
p340
aV"We don't believe you.
p341
aVWe don't need it. We don't like it.
p342
aVYou're scaring us."
p343
aa(lp344
VWhat if they had said,
p345
aV"If you're the kind of person who likes to have total control
p346
aVover every aspect of your life,
p347
aVboy, do we have a product for you.
p348
aVIt pauses live TV, skips commercials,
p349
aVmemorizes your viewing habits, etc., etc."
p350
aVPeople don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it,
p351
aVand what you do simply serves as the proof of what you believe.
p352
aa(lp353
VNow let me give you a successful example of the law of diffusion of innovation.
p354
aVIn the summer of 1963,
p355
aV250,000 people showed up on the mall in Washington
p356
aVto hear Dr. King speak.
p357
aVThey sent out no invitations,
p358
aVand there was no website to check the date.
p359
aVHow do you do that?
p360
aVWell, Dr. King wasn't the only man in America
p361
aVwho was a great orator.
p362
aVHe wasn't the only man in America who suffered
p363
aVin a pre-civil rights America.
p364
aVIn fact, some of his ideas were bad.
p365
aVBut he had a gift.
p366
aVHe didn't go around telling people what needed to change in America.
p367
aVHe went around and told people what he believed.
p368
aV"I believe, I believe, I believe," he told people.
p369
aVAnd people who believed what he believed
p370
aVtook his cause, and they made it their own, and they told people.
p371
aVAnd some of those people created structures
p372
aVto get the word out to even more people.
p373
aVAnd lo and behold, 250,000 people showed up
p374
aVon the right day at the right time to hear him speak.
p375
aa(lp376
VHow many of them showed up for him?
p377
aVZero.
p378
aVThey showed up for themselves.
p379
aVIt's what they believed about America
p380
aVthat got them to travel in a bus for eight hours
p381
aVto stand in the sun in Washington in the middle of August.
p382
aVIt's what they believed, and it wasn't about black versus white:
p383
aV25% of the audience was white.
p384
aa(lp385
VDr. King believed that there are two types of laws in this world:
p386
aVthose that are made by a higher authority and those that are made by men.
p387
aVAnd not until all the laws that are made by men
p388
aVare consistent with the laws made by the higher authority
p389
aVwill we live in a just world.
p390
aVIt just so happened that the Civil Rights Movement
p391
aVwas the perfect thing to help him bring his cause to life.
p392
aVWe followed, not for him, but for ourselves.
p393
aVBy the way, he gave the "I have a dream" speech,
p394
aVnot the "I have a plan" speech.
p395
aa(lp396
V(Laughter)
p397
aa(lp398
VListen to politicians now, with their comprehensive 12-point plans.
p399
aVThey're not inspiring anybody.
p400
aVBecause there are leaders and there are those who lead.
p401
aVLeaders hold a position of power or authority,
p402
aVbut those who lead inspire us.
p403
aVWhether they're individuals or organizations,
p404
aVwe follow those who lead, not because we have to,
p405
aVbut because we want to.
p406
aVWe follow those who lead, not for them, but for ourselves.
p407
aVAnd it's those who start with "why"
p408
aVthat have the ability to inspire those around them
p409
aVor find others who inspire them.
