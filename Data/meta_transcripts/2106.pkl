VThere is an entire genre of YouTube videos
p4
aVdevoted to an experience which
p5
aVI am certain that everyone in this room has had.
p6
aVIt entails an individual who,
p7
aVthinking they're alone,
p8
aVengages in some expressive behavior \u2014
p9
aVwild singing, gyrating dancing,
p10
aVsome mild sexual activity \u2014
p11
aVonly to discover that, in fact, they are not alone,
p12
aVthat there is a person watching and lurking,
p13
aVthe discovery of which causes them
p14
aVto immediately cease what they were doing
p15
aVin horror.
p16
aVThe sense of shame and humiliation
p17
aVin their face is palpable.
p18
aVIt's the sense of,
p19
aV"This is something I'm willing to do
p20
aVonly if no one else is watching."
p21
aa(lp22
VThis is the crux of the work
p23
aVon which I have been singularly focused
p24
aVfor the last 16 months,
p25
aVthe question of why privacy matters,
p26
aVa question that has arisen
p27
aVin the context of a global debate,
p28
aVenabled by the revelations of Edward Snowden
p29
aVthat the United States and its partners,
p30
aVunbeknownst to the entire world,
p31
aVhas converted the Internet,
p32
aVonce heralded as an unprecedented tool
p33
aVof liberation and democratization,
p34
aVinto an unprecedented zone
p35
aVof mass, indiscriminate surveillance.
p36
aa(lp37
VThere is a very common sentiment
p38
aVthat arises in this debate,
p39
aVeven among people who are uncomfortable
p40
aVwith mass surveillance, which says
p41
aVthat there is no real harm
p42
aVthat comes from this large-scale invasion
p43
aVbecause only people who are engaged in bad acts
p44
aVhave a reason to want to hide
p45
aVand to care about their privacy.
p46
aVThis worldview is implicitly grounded
p47
aVin the proposition that there are two kinds of people in the world,
p48
aVgood people and bad people.
p49
aVBad people are those who plot terrorist attacks
p50
aVor who engage in violent criminality
p51
aVand therefore have reasons to want to hide what they're doing,
p52
aVhave reasons to care about their privacy.
p53
aVBut by contrast, good people
p54
aVare people who go to work,
p55
aVcome home, raise their children, watch television.
p56
aVThey use the Internet not to plot bombing attacks
p57
aVbut to read the news or exchange recipes
p58
aVor to plan their kids' Little League games,
p59
aVand those people are doing nothing wrong
p60
aVand therefore have nothing to hide
p61
aVand no reason to fear
p62
aVthe government monitoring them.
p63
aa(lp64
VThe people who are actually saying that
p65
aVare engaged in a very extreme act
p66
aVof self-deprecation.
p67
aVWhat they're really saying is,
p68
aV"I have agreed to make myself
p69
aVsuch a harmless and unthreatening
p70
aVand uninteresting person that I actually don't fear
p71
aVhaving the government know what it is that I'm doing."
p72
aVThis mindset has found what I think
p73
aVis its purest expression
p74
aVin a 2009 interview with
p75
aVthe longtime CEO of Google, Eric Schmidt, who,
p76
aVwhen asked about all the different ways his company
p77
aVis causing invasions of privacy
p78
aVfor hundreds of millions of people around the world,
p79
aVsaid this: He said,
p80
aV"If you're doing something that you don't want
p81
aVother people to know,
p82
aVmaybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place."
p83
aa(lp84
VNow, there's all kinds of things to say about
p85
aVthat mentality,
p86
aVthe first of which is that the people who say that,
p87
aVwho say that privacy isn't really important,
p88
aVthey don't actually believe it,
p89
aVand the way you know that they don't actually believe it
p90
aVis that while they say with their words that privacy doesn't matter,
p91
aVwith their actions, they take all kinds of steps
p92
aVto safeguard their privacy.
p93
aVThey put passwords on their email
p94
aVand their social media accounts,
p95
aVthey put locks on their bedroom
p96
aVand bathroom doors,
p97
aVall steps designed to prevent other people
p98
aVfrom entering what they consider their private realm
p99
aVand knowing what it is that they don't want other people to know.
p100
aVThe very same Eric Schmidt, the CEO of Google,
p101
aVordered his employees at Google
p102
aVto cease speaking with the online
p103
aVInternet magazine CNET
p104
aVafter CNET published an article
p105
aVfull of personal, private information
p106
aVabout Eric Schmidt,
p107
aVwhich it obtained exclusively through Google searches
p108
aVand using other Google products. (Laughter)
p109
aVThis same division can be seen
p110
aVwith the CEO of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg,
p111
aVwho in an infamous interview in 2010
p112
aVpronounced that privacy is no longer
p113
aVa "social norm."
p114
aVLast year, Mark Zuckerberg and his new wife
p115
aVpurchased not only their own house
p116
aVbut also all four adjacent houses in Palo Alto
p117
aVfor a total of 30 million dollars
p118
aVin order to ensure that they enjoyed a zone of privacy
p119
aVthat prevented other people from monitoring
p120
aVwhat they do in their personal lives.
p121
aa(lp122
VOver the last 16 months, as I've debated this issue around the world,
p123
aVevery single time somebody has said to me,
p124
aV"I don't really worry about invasions of privacy
p125
aVbecause I don't have anything to hide."
p126
aVI always say the same thing to them.
p127
aVI get out a pen, I write down my email address.
p128
aVI say, "Here's my email address.
p129
aVWhat I want you to do when you get home
p130
aVis email me the passwords
p131
aVto all of your email accounts,
p132
aVnot just the nice, respectable work one in your name,
p133
aVbut all of them,
p134
aVbecause I want to be able to just troll through
p135
aVwhat it is you're doing online,
p136
aVread what I want to read and publish whatever I find interesting.
p137
aVAfter all, if you're not a bad person,
p138
aVif you're doing nothing wrong,
p139
aVyou should have nothing to hide."
p140
aa(lp141
VNot a single person has taken me up on that offer.
p142
aVI check and \u2014 (Applause)
p143
aVI check that email account religiously all the time.
p144
aVIt's a very desolate place.
p145
aVAnd there's a reason for that,
p146
aVwhich is that we as human beings,
p147
aVeven those of us who in words
p148
aVdisclaim the importance of our own privacy,
p149
aVinstinctively understand
p150
aVthe profound importance of it.
p151
aVIt is true that as human beings, we're social animals,
p152
aVwhich means we have a need for other people
p153
aVto know what we're doing and saying and thinking,
p154
aVwhich is why we voluntarily publish information about ourselves online.
p155
aVBut equally essential to what it means
p156
aVto be a free and fulfilled human being
p157
aVis to have a place that we can go
p158
aVand be free of the judgmental eyes of other people.
p159
aVThere's a reason why we seek that out,
p160
aVand our reason is that all of us \u2014
p161
aVnot just terrorists and criminals, all of us \u2014
p162
aVhave things to hide.
p163
aVThere are all sorts of things that we do and think
p164
aVthat we're willing to tell our physician
p165
aVor our lawyer or our psychologist or our spouse
p166
aVor our best friend that we would be mortified
p167
aVfor the rest of the world to learn.
p168
aVWe make judgments every single day
p169
aVabout the kinds of things that we say and think and do
p170
aVthat we're willing to have other people know,
p171
aVand the kinds of things that we say and think and do
p172
aVthat we don't want anyone else to know about.
p173
aVPeople can very easily in words claim
p174
aVthat they don't value their privacy,
p175
aVbut their actions negate the authenticity of that belief.
p176
aa(lp177
VNow, there's a reason why privacy is so craved
p178
aVuniversally and instinctively.
p179
aVIt isn't just a reflexive movement
p180
aVlike breathing air or drinking water.
p181
aVThe reason is that when we're in a state
p182
aVwhere we can be monitored, where we can be watched,
p183
aVour behavior changes dramatically.
p184
aVThe range of behavioral options that we consider
p185
aVwhen we think we're being watched
p186
aVseverely reduce.
p187
aVThis is just a fact of human nature
p188
aVthat has been recognized in social science
p189
aVand in literature and in religion
p190
aVand in virtually every field of discipline.
p191
aVThere are dozens of psychological studies
p192
aVthat prove that when somebody knows
p193
aVthat they might be watched,
p194
aVthe behavior they engage in
p195
aVis vastly more conformist and compliant.
p196
aVHuman shame is a very powerful motivator,
p197
aVas is the desire to avoid it,
p198
aVand that's the reason why people,
p199
aVwhen they're in a state of being watched, make decisions
p200
aVnot that are the byproduct of their own agency
p201
aVbut that are about the expectations
p202
aVthat others have of them
p203
aVor the mandates of societal orthodoxy.
p204
aa(lp205
VThis realization was exploited most powerfully
p206
aVfor pragmatic ends by the 18th- century philosopher Jeremy Bentham,
p207
aVwho set out to resolve an important problem
p208
aVushered in by the industrial age,
p209
aVwhere, for the first time, institutions had become
p210
aVso large and centralized
p211
aVthat they were no longer able to monitor
p212
aVand therefore control each one of their individual members,
p213
aVand the solution that he devised
p214
aVwas an architectural design
p215
aVoriginally intended to be implemented in prisons
p216
aVthat he called the panopticon,
p217
aVthe primary attribute of which was the construction
p218
aVof an enormous tower in the center of the institution
p219
aVwhere whoever controlled the institution
p220
aVcould at any moment watch any of the inmates,
p221
aValthough they couldn't watch all of them at all times.
p222
aVAnd crucial to this design
p223
aVwas that the inmates could not actually
p224
aVsee into the panopticon, into the tower,
p225
aVand so they never knew
p226
aVif they were being watched or even when.
p227
aVAnd what made him so excited about this discovery
p228
aVwas that that would mean that the prisoners
p229
aVwould have to assume that they were being watched
p230
aVat any given moment,
p231
aVwhich would be the ultimate enforcer
p232
aVfor obedience and compliance.
p233
aVThe 20th-century French philosopher Michel Foucault
p234
aVrealized that that model could be used
p235
aVnot just for prisons but for every institution
p236
aVthat seeks to control human behavior:
p237
aVschools, hospitals, factories, workplaces.
p238
aVAnd what he said was that this mindset,
p239
aVthis framework discovered by Bentham,
p240
aVwas the key means of societal control
p241
aVfor modern, Western societies,
p242
aVwhich no longer need
p243
aVthe overt weapons of tyranny \u2014
p244
aVpunishing or imprisoning or killing dissidents,
p245
aVor legally compelling loyalty to a particular party \u2014
p246
aVbecause mass surveillance creates
p247
aVa prison in the mind
p248
aVthat is a much more subtle
p249
aVthough much more effective means
p250
aVof fostering compliance with social norms
p251
aVor with social orthodoxy,
p252
aVmuch more effective
p253
aVthan brute force could ever be.
p254
aa(lp255
VThe most iconic work of literature about surveillance
p256
aVand privacy is the George Orwell novel "1984,"
p257
aVwhich we all learn in school, and therefore it's almost become a cliche.
p258
aVIn fact, whenever you bring it up in a debate about surveillance,
p259
aVpeople instantaneously dismiss it
p260
aVas inapplicable, and what they say is,
p261
aV"Oh, well in '1984,' there were monitors in people's homes,
p262
aVthey were being watched at every given moment,
p263
aVand that has nothing to do with the surveillance state that we face."
p264
aVThat is an actual fundamental misapprehension
p265
aVof the warnings that Orwell issued in "1984."
p266
aVThe warning that he was issuing
p267
aVwas about a surveillance state
p268
aVnot that monitored everybody at all times,
p269
aVbut where people were aware that they could
p270
aVbe monitored at any given moment.
p271
aVHere is how Orwell's narrator, Winston Smith,
p272
aVdescribed the surveillance system
p273
aVthat they faced:
p274
aV"There was, of course, no way of knowing
p275
aVwhether you were being watched at any given moment."
p276
aVHe went on to say,
p277
aV"At any rate, they could plug in your wire
p278
aVwhenever they wanted to.
p279
aVYou had to live, did live,
p280
aVfrom habit that became instinct,
p281
aVin the assumption that every sound you made
p282
aVwas overheard and except in darkness
p283
aVevery movement scrutinized."
p284
aa(lp285
VThe Abrahamic religions similarly posit
p286
aVthat there's an invisible, all-knowing authority
p287
aVwho, because of its omniscience,
p288
aValways watches whatever you're doing,
p289
aVwhich means you never have a private moment,
p290
aVthe ultimate enforcer
p291
aVfor obedience to its dictates.
p292
aa(lp293
VWhat all of these seemingly disparate works
p294
aVrecognize, the conclusion that they all reach,
p295
aVis that a society in which people
p296
aVcan be monitored at all times
p297
aVis a society that breeds conformity
p298
aVand obedience and submission,
p299
aVwhich is why every tyrant,
p300
aVthe most overt to the most subtle,
p301
aVcraves that system.
p302
aVConversely, even more importantly,
p303
aVit is a realm of privacy,
p304
aVthe ability to go somewhere where we can think
p305
aVand reason and interact and speak
p306
aVwithout the judgmental eyes of others being cast upon us,
p307
aVin which creativity and exploration
p308
aVand dissent exclusively reside,
p309
aVand that is the reason why,
p310
aVwhen we allow a society to exist
p311
aVin which we're subject to constant monitoring,
p312
aVwe allow the essence of human freedom
p313
aVto be severely crippled.
p314
aa(lp315
VThe last point I want to observe about this mindset,
p316
aVthe idea that only people who  are doing something wrong
p317
aVhave things to hide and therefore reasons to care about privacy,
p318
aVis that it entrenches two very destructive messages,
p319
aVtwo destructive lessons,
p320
aVthe first of which is that
p321
aVthe only people who care about privacy,
p322
aVthe only people who will seek out privacy,
p323
aVare by definition bad people.
p324
aVThis is a conclusion that we should have
p325
aVall kinds of reasons for avoiding,
p326
aVthe most important of which is that when you say,
p327
aV"somebody who is doing bad things,"
p328
aVyou probably mean things like plotting a terrorist attack
p329
aVor engaging in violent criminality,
p330
aVa much narrower conception
p331
aVof what people who wield power mean
p332
aVwhen they say, "doing bad things."
p333
aVFor them, "doing bad things" typically means
p334
aVdoing something that poses meaningful challenges
p335
aVto the exercise of our own power.
p336
aa(lp337
VThe other really destructive
p338
aVand, I think, even more insidious lesson
p339
aVthat comes from accepting this mindset
p340
aVis there's an implicit bargain
p341
aVthat people who accept this mindset have accepted,
p342
aVand that bargain is this:
p343
aVIf you're willing to render yourself
p344
aVsufficiently harmless,
p345
aVsufficiently unthreatening
p346
aVto those who wield political power,
p347
aVthen and only then can you be free
p348
aVof the dangers of surveillance.
p349
aVIt's only those who are dissidents,
p350
aVwho challenge power,
p351
aVwho have something to worry about.
p352
aVThere are all kinds of reasons why we should want to avoid that lesson as well.
p353
aVYou may be a person who, right now,
p354
aVdoesn't want to engage in that behavior,
p355
aVbut at some point in the future you might.
p356
aVEven if you're somebody who decides
p357
aVthat you never want to,
p358
aVthe fact that there are other people
p359
aVwho are willing to and able to resist
p360
aVand be adversarial to those in power \u2014
p361
aVdissidents and journalists
p362
aVand activists and a whole range of others \u2014
p363
aVis something that brings us all collective good
p364
aVthat we should want to preserve.
p365
aVEqually critical is that the measure
p366
aVof how free a society is
p367
aVis not how it treats its good,
p368
aVobedient, compliant citizens,
p369
aVbut how it treats its dissidents
p370
aVand those who resist orthodoxy.
p371
aVBut the most important reason
p372
aVis that a system of mass surveillance
p373
aVsuppresses our own freedom in all sorts of ways.
p374
aVIt renders off-limits
p375
aVall kinds of behavioral choices
p376
aVwithout our even knowing that it's happened.
p377
aVThe renowned socialist activist Rosa Luxemburg
p378
aVonce said, "He who does not move
p379
aVdoes not notice his chains."
p380
aVWe can try and render the chains
p381
aVof mass surveillance invisible or undetectable,
p382
aVbut the constraints that it imposes on us
p383
aVdo not become any less potent.
p384
aa(lp385
VThank you very much.
p386
aa(lp387
V(Applause)
p388
aa(lp389
VThank you.
p390
aa(lp391
V(Applause)
p392
aa(lp393
VThank you.
p394
aa(lp395
V(Applause)
p396
aa(lp397
VBruno Giussani: Glenn, thank you.
p398
aVThe case is rather convincing, I have to say,
p399
aVbut I want to bring you back
p400
aVto the last 16 months and to Edward Snowden
p401
aVfor a few questions, if you don't mind.
p402
aVThe first one is personal to you.
p403
aVWe have all read about the arrest of your partner,
p404
aVDavid Miranda in London, and other difficulties,
p405
aVbut I assume that
p406
aVin terms of personal engagement and risk,
p407
aVthat the pressure on you is not that easy
p408
aVto take on the biggest sovereign  organizations in the world.
p409
aVTell us a little bit about that.
p410
aa(lp411
VGlenn Greenwald: You know, I think one of the things that happens
p412
aVis that people's courage in this regard
p413
aVgets contagious,
p414
aVand so although I and the other journalists with whom I was working
p415
aVwere certainly aware of the risk \u2014
p416
aVthe United States continues to be the most powerful country in the world
p417
aVand doesn't appreciate it when you
p418
aVdisclose thousands of their secrets
p419
aVon the Internet at will \u2014
p420
aVseeing somebody who is a 29-year-old
p421
aVordinary person who grew up in
p422
aVa very ordinary environment
p423
aVexercise the degree of principled courage that Edward Snowden risked,
p424
aVknowing that he was going to go to prison for the rest of his life
p425
aVor that his life would unravel,
p426
aVinspired me and inspired other journalists
p427
aVand inspired, I think, people around the world,
p428
aVincluding future whistleblowers,
p429
aVto realize that they can engage in that kind of behavior as well.
p430
aa(lp431
VBG: I'm curious about your relationship with Ed Snowden,
p432
aVbecause you have spoken with him a lot,
p433
aVand you certainly continue doing so,
p434
aVbut in your book, you never call him Edward,
p435
aVnor Ed, you say "Snowden." How come?
p436
aa(lp437
VGG: You know, I'm sure that's something
p438
aVfor a team of psychologists to examine. (Laughter)
p439
aVI don't really know. The reason I think that,
p440
aVone of the important objectives that he actually had,
p441
aVone of his, I think, most important tactics,
p442
aVwas that he knew that one of the ways
p443
aVto distract attention from the substance of the revelations
p444
aVwould be to try and personalize the focus on him,
p445
aVand for that reason, he stayed out of the media.
p446
aVHe tried not to ever have his personal life
p447
aVsubject to examination,
p448
aVand so I think calling him Snowden
p449
aVis a way of just identifying him as this important historical actor
p450
aVrather than trying to personalize him in a way
p451
aVthat might distract attention from the substance.
p452
aa(lp453
VModerator: So his revelations, your analysis,
p454
aVthe work of other journalists,
p455
aVhave really developed the debate,
p456
aVand many governments, for example, have reacted,
p457
aVincluding in Brazil, with projects and programs
p458
aVto reshape a little bit the design of the Internet, etc.
p459
aVThere are a lot of things going on in that sense.
p460
aVBut I'm wondering, for you personally,
p461
aVwhat is the endgame?
p462
aVAt what point will you think,
p463
aVwell, actually, we've succeeded  in moving the dial?
p464
aa(lp465
VGG: Well, I mean, the endgame for me as a journalist
p466
aVis very simple, which is to make sure
p467
aVthat every single document that's newsworthy
p468
aVand that ought to be disclosed
p469
aVends up being disclosed,
p470
aVand that secrets that should never have been kept in the first place
p471
aVend up uncovered.
p472
aVTo me, that's the essence of journalism
p473
aVand that's what I'm committed to doing.
p474
aVAs somebody who finds mass surveillance odious
p475
aVfor all the reasons I just talked about and a lot more,
p476
aVI mean, I look at this as work that will never end
p477
aVuntil governments around the world
p478
aVare no longer able to subject entire populations
p479
aVto monitoring and surveillance
p480
aVunless they convince some court or some entity
p481
aVthat the person they've targeted
p482
aVhas actually done something wrong.
p483
aVTo me, that's the way that privacy can be rejuvenated.

VBG: So Snowden is very, as we've seen at TED,
p486
aVis very articulate in presenting and portraying himself
p487
aVas a defender of democratic values
p488
aVand democratic principles.
p489
aVBut then, many people really  find it difficult to believe
p490
aVthat those are his only motivations.
p491
aVThey find it difficult to believe
p492
aVthat there was no money involved,
p493
aVthat he didn't sell some of those secrets,
p494
aVeven to China and to Russia,
p495
aVwhich are clearly not the best friends
p496
aVof the United States right now.
p497
aVAnd I'm sure many people in the room
p498
aVare wondering the same question.
p499
aVDo you consider it possible there is
p500
aVthat part of Snowden we've not seen yet?
p501
aa(lp502
VGG: No, I consider that absurd and idiotic.
p503
aV(Laughter) If you wanted to,
p504
aVand I know you're just playing devil's advocate,
p505
aVbut if you wanted to sell
p506
aVsecrets to another country,
p507
aVwhich he could have done and become
p508
aVextremely rich doing so,
p509
aVthe last thing you would  do is take those secrets
p510
aVand give them to journalists and ask journalists to publish them,
p511
aVbecause it makes those secrets worthless.
p512
aVPeople who want to enrich themselves
p513
aVdo it secretly by selling  secrets to the government,
p514
aVbut I think there's one important point worth making,
p515
aVwhich is, that accusation comes from
p516
aVpeople in the U.S. government,
p517
aVfrom people in the media who are loyalists
p518
aVto these various governments,
p519
aVand I think a lot of times when people make accusations like that about other people \u2014
p520
aV"Oh, he can't really be doing this
p521
aVfor principled reasons,
p522
aVhe must have some corrupt, nefarious reason" \u2014
p523
aVthey're saying a lot more about themselves
p524
aVthan they are the target of their accusations,
p525
aVbecause \u2014 (Applause) \u2014
p526
aVthose people, the ones who make that accusation,
p527
aVthey themselves never act
p528
aVfor any reason other than corrupt reasons,
p529
aVso they assume
p530
aVthat everybody else is plagued by the same disease
p531
aVof soullessness as they are,
p532
aVand so that's the assumption.
