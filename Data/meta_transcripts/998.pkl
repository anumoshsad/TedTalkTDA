VI guess the story actually has to start
p4
aVmaybe back in the the 1960s,
p5
aVwhen I was seven or eight years old,
p6
aVwatching Jacques Cousteau documentaries on the living room floor
p7
aVwith my mask and flippers on.
p8
aVThen after every episode, I had to go up to the bathtub
p9
aVand swim around the bathtub and look at the drain,
p10
aVbecause that's all there was to look at.
p11
aVAnd by the time I turned 16,
p12
aVI pursued a career in marine science,
p13
aVin exploration and diving,
p14
aVand lived in underwater habitats, like this one off the Florida Keys,
p15
aVfor 30 days total.
p16
aVBrian Skerry took this shot. Thanks, Brian.
p17
aVAnd I've dived in deep-sea submersibles around the world.
p18
aVAnd this one is the deepest diving submarine in the world,
p19
aVoperated by the Japanese government.
p20
aa(lp21
VAnd Sylvia Earle and I
p22
aVwere on an expedition in this submarine
p23
aV20 years ago in Japan.
p24
aVAnd on my dive, I went down 18,000 feet,
p25
aVto an area that I thought
p26
aVwould be pristine wilderness area on the sea floor.
p27
aVBut when I got there, I found
p28
aVlots of plastic garbage and other debris.
p29
aVAnd it was really a turning point in my life,
p30
aVwhere I started to realize
p31
aVthat I couldn't just go have fun doing science and exploration.
p32
aVI needed to put it into a context.
p33
aVI needed to head towards conservation goals.
p34
aVSo I began to work
p35
aVwith National Geographic Society and others
p36
aVand led expeditions to Antarctica.
p37
aVI led three diving expeditions to Antarctica.
p38
aVTen years ago was a seminal trip,
p39
aVwhere we explored that big iceberg, B-15,
p40
aVthe largest iceberg in history, that broke off the Ross Ice Shelf.
p41
aVAnd we developed techniques
p42
aVto dive inside and under the iceberg,
p43
aVsuch as heating pads on our kidneys
p44
aVwith a battery that we dragged around,
p45
aVso that, as the blood flowed through our kidneys,
p46
aVit would get a little boost of warmth
p47
aVbefore going back into our bodies.
p48
aVBut after three trips to Antarctica,
p49
aVI decided that it might be nicer to work in warmer water.
p50
aVAnd that same year, 10 years ago,
p51
aVI headed north to the Phoenix Islands.
p52
aa(lp53
VAnd I'm going to tell you that story here in a moment.
p54
aVBut before I do, I just want you to ponder this graph for a moment.
p55
aVYou may have seen this in other forms,
p56
aVbut the top line is the amount of protected area
p57
aVon land, globally,
p58
aVand it's about 12 percent.
p59
aVAnd you can see that it kind of hockey sticks up
p60
aVaround the 1960s and '70s,
p61
aVand it's on kind of a nice trajectory right now.
p62
aVAnd that's probably because
p63
aVthat's when everybody got aware of the environment
p64
aVand Earth Day
p65
aVand all the stuff that happened in the '60s with the Hippies and everything
p66
aVreally did, I think, have an affect on global awareness.
p67
aVBut the ocean-protected area
p68
aVis basically flat line
p69
aVuntil right about now \u2014 it appears to be ticking up.
p70
aVAnd I do believe that we are at the hockey stick point
p71
aVof the protected area in the ocean.
p72
aVI think we would have gotten there a lot earlier
p73
aVif we could see what happens in the ocean
p74
aVlike we can see what happens on land.
p75
aVBut unfortunately, the ocean is opaque,
p76
aVand we can't see what's going on.
p77
aVAnd therefore we're way behind on protection.
p78
aVBut scuba diving, submersibles
p79
aVand all the work that we're setting about to do here
p80
aVwill help rectify that.
p81
aa(lp82
VSo where are the Phoenix Islands?
p83
aVThey were the world's largest marine-protected area
p84
aVup until last week
p85
aVwhen the Chagos Archipelago was declared.
p86
aVIt's in the mid-Pacific. It's about five days from anywhere.
p87
aVIf you want to get to the Phoenix Islands,
p88
aVit's five days from Fiji,
p89
aVit's five days from Hawaii, it's five days from Samoa.
p90
aVIt's out in the middle of the Pacific,
p91
aVright around the Equator.
p92
aVI had never heard of the islands 10 years ago,
p93
aVnor the country, Kiribati, that owns them,
p94
aVtill two friends of mine who run a liveaboard dive boat in Fiji
p95
aVsaid, "Greg, would you lead a scientific expedition up to these islands?
p96
aVThey've never been dived."
p97
aVAnd I said, "Yeah.
p98
aVBut tell me where they are and the country that owns them."
p99
aVSo that's when I first learned of the Islands
p100
aVand had no idea what I was getting into.
p101
aVBut I was in for the adventure.
p102
aVLet me give you a little peek here of the Phoenix Islands-protected area.
p103
aVIt's a very deep-water part of our planet.
p104
aVThe average depths are about 12,000 ft.
p105
aVThere's lots of seamounts in the Phoenix Islands,
p106
aVwhich are specifically part of the protected area.
p107
aVSeamounts are important for biodiversity.
p108
aVThere's actually more mountains in the ocean than there are on land.
p109
aVIt's an interesting fact.
p110
aVAnd the Phoenix Islands is very rich in those seamounts.
p111
aVSo it's a deep \u2014 think about it in a big three-dimensional space,
p112
aVvery deep three-dimensional space
p113
aVwith herds of tuna, whales,
p114
aVall kinds of deep sea marine life
p115
aVlike we've seen here before.
p116
aa(lp117
VThat's the vessel that we took up there
p118
aVfor these studies, early on,
p119
aVand that's what the Islands look like \u2014 you can see in the background.
p120
aVThey're very low to the water,
p121
aVand they're all uninhabited, except one island
p122
aVhas about 35 caretakers on it.
p123
aVAnd they've been uninhabited for most of time
p124
aVbecause even in the ancient days,
p125
aVthese islands were too far away
p126
aVfrom the bright lights of Fiji and Hawaii and Tahiti
p127
aVfor those ancient Polynesian mariners
p128
aVthat were traversing the Pacific so widely.
p129
aVBut we got up there,
p130
aVand I had the unique and wonderful scientific opportunity and personal opportunity
p131
aVto get to a place that had never been dived
p132
aVand just get to an island and go, "Okay, where are we going to dive?
p133
aVLet's try there,"
p134
aVand then falling into the water.
p135
aVBoth my personal and my professional life changed.
p136
aa(lp137
VSuddenly, I saw a world
p138
aVthat I had never seen before in the ocean \u2014
p139
aVschools of fish that were so dense
p140
aVthey dulled the penetration of sunlight from the surface,
p141
aVcoral reefs that were continuous
p142
aVand solid and colorful,
p143
aVlarge fish everywhere,
p144
aVmanta rays.
p145
aVIt was an ecosystem. Parrotfish spawning \u2014
p146
aVthis is about 5,000 longnose parrotfish spawning
p147
aVat the entrance to one of the Phoenix Islands.
p148
aVYou can see the fish are balled up
p149
aVand then there's a little cloudy area there
p150
aVwhere they're exchanging the eggs and sperm for reproduction \u2014
p151
aVevents that the ocean is supposed to do,
p152
aVbut struggles to do in many places now
p153
aVbecause of human activity.
p154
aVThe Phoenix Islands and all the equatorial parts of our planet
p155
aVare very important for tuna fisheries,
p156
aVespecially this yellowfin tuna that you see here.
p157
aVPhoenix Islands is a major tuna location.
p158
aVAnd sharks \u2014 we had sharks on our early dives,
p159
aVup to 150 sharks at once,
p160
aVwhich is an indication
p161
aVof a very, very healthy, very strong, system.
p162
aa(lp163
VSo I thought the scenes
p164
aVof never-ending wilderness
p165
aVwould go on forever,
p166
aVbut they did finally come to an end.
p167
aVAnd we explored the surface of the Islands as well \u2014
p168
aVvery important bird nesting site,
p169
aVsome of the most important bird-nesting sites in the Pacific, in the world.
p170
aVAnd we finished our trip.
p171
aVAnd that's the area again.
p172
aVYou can see the Islands \u2014 there are eight islands \u2014
p173
aVthat pop out of the water.
p174
aVThe peaks that don't come out of the water are the seamounts.
p175
aVRemember, a seamount turns into an island when it hits the surface.
p176
aa(lp177
VAnd what's the context of the Phoenix Islands?
p178
aVWhere do these exist?
p179
aVWell they exist in the Republic of Kiribati,
p180
aVand Kiribati is located in the Central Pacific
p181
aVin three island groups.
p182
aVIn the west we have the Gilbert Islands.
p183
aVIn the center we have the Phoenix Islands,
p184
aVwhich is the subject that I'm talking about.
p185
aVAnd then over to the east we have the Line Islands.
p186
aVIt's the largest atoll nation in the world.
p187
aVAnd they have
p188
aVabout 110,000 people
p189
aVspread out over 33 islands.
p190
aVThey control 3.4 million cubic miles of ocean,
p191
aVand that's between one and two percent
p192
aVof all the ocean water on the planet.
p193
aVAnd when I was first going up there,
p194
aVI barely knew the name of this country 10 years ago,
p195
aVand people would ask me,
p196
aV"Why are you going to this place called Kiribati?"
p197
aVAnd it reminded me of that old joke
p198
aVwhere the bank robber comes out of the courthouse handcuffed,
p199
aVand the reporter yells, "Hey, Willy. Why do you rob banks?"
p200
aVAnd he says, "cause that's where all the money is."
p201
aVAnd I would tell people, "Why do I go to Kiribati?
p202
aVBecause that's where all the ocean is."
p203
aVThey basically are one nation
p204
aVthat controls most of the equatorial waters
p205
aVof the Central Pacific Ocean.
p206
aa(lp207
VThey're also a country
p208
aVthat is in dire danger.
p209
aVSea levels are rising,
p210
aVand Kiribati, along with 42 other nations in the world,
p211
aVwill be under water within 50 to 100 years
p212
aVdue to climate change
p213
aVand the associated sea-level rise from thermal expansion
p214
aVand the melting of freshwater into the ocean.
p215
aVThe Islands rise only one to two meters
p216
aVabove the surface.
p217
aVSome of the islands have already gone under water.
p218
aVAnd these nations are faced with a real problem.
p219
aVWe as a world are faced with a problem.
p220
aVWhat do we do with displaced fellow Earthlings
p221
aVwho no longer have a home on the planet?
p222
aVThe president of the Maldives
p223
aVconducted a mock cabinet meeting
p224
aVunderwater recently
p225
aVto highlight the dire straits of these countries.
p226
aVSo it's something we need to focus on.
p227
aVBut back to the Phoenix Islands,
p228
aVwhich is the subject of this Talk.
p229
aa(lp230
VAfter I got back, I said,
p231
aVokay, this is amazing, what we found.
p232
aVI'd like to go back and share it with the government of Kiribati,
p233
aVwho are over in Tarawa,
p234
aVthe westernmost group.
p235
aVSo I started contacting them \u2014
p236
aVbecause they had actually given me a permit to do this \u2014
p237
aVand I said, "I want to come up and tell you what we found."
p238
aVAnd for some reason they didn't want me to come,
p239
aVor it was hard to find a time and a place, and it took a while,
p240
aVbut finally they said, "Okay, you can come.
p241
aVBut if you come, you have to buy lunch
p242
aVfor everybody who comes to the seminar."
p243
aVSo I said, "Okay, I'm happy to buy lunch.
p244
aVJust get whatever anybody wants."
p245
aVSo David Obura, a coral reef biologist, and I went to Tarawa,
p246
aVand we presented for two hours
p247
aVon the amazing findings of the Phoenix Islands.
p248
aVAnd the country never knew this. They never had any data from this area.
p249
aVThey'd never had any information from the Phoenix Islands.
p250
aVAfter the talk, the Minister of Fisheries walked up to me
p251
aVand he said, "Greg, do you realize
p252
aVthat you are the first scientist
p253
aVwho has ever come back
p254
aVand told us what they did?"
p255
aVHe said, "We often issue these permits
p256
aVto do research in our waters,
p257
aVbut usually we get a note two or three years later,
p258
aVor a reprint.
p259
aVBut you're the first one who's ever come back and told us what you did.
p260
aVAnd we really appreciate that. And we're buying you lunch today.
p261
aVAnd are you free for dinner?"
p262
aa(lp263
VAnd I was free for dinner,
p264
aVand I went out to dinner with the Minister of Fisheries in Kiribati.
p265
aVAnd over the course of dinner,
p266
aVI learned that Kiribati gains most of its revenue \u2014
p267
aVit's a very poor country \u2014
p268
aVbut it gains what revenue is has
p269
aVby selling access to foreign nations
p270
aVto take fish out of its waters,
p271
aVbecause Kiribati does not have the capacity
p272
aVto take the fish itself.
p273
aVAnd the deal that they strike
p274
aVis the extracting country
p275
aVgives Kiribati five percent
p276
aVof the landed value.
p277
aVSo if the United States
p278
aVremoves a million dollars'
p279
aVworth of lobsters from a reef,
p280
aVKiribati gets 50,000 dollars.
p281
aVAnd, you know, it didn't seem like a very good deal to me.
p282
aVSo I asked the Minister over dinner,
p283
aVI said, "Would you consider a situation
p284
aVwhere you would still get paid \u2014
p285
aVwe do the math and figure out what the value of the resource is \u2014
p286
aVbut you leave fish and the sharks
p287
aVand the shrimp in the water?"
p288
aVHe stopped, and he said, "Yes, we would like to do that
p289
aVto deal with our overfishing problem,
p290
aVand I think we would call it a reverse fishing license."
p291
aVHe coined the term "reverse fishing license."
p292
aVSo I said, "Yes, a 'reverse fishing license.'"
p293
aa(lp294
VSo we walked away from this dinner
p295
aVreally not knowing where to go at that point.
p296
aVI went back to the States and started looking around
p297
aVto see if I could find examples
p298
aVwhere reverse fishing licenses
p299
aVhad been issued,
p300
aVand it turned out there were none.
p301
aVThere were no oceanic deals
p302
aVwhere countries were compensated for not fishing.
p303
aVIt had occurred on land,
p304
aVin rainforests of South America and Africa,
p305
aVwhere landowners had been paid
p306
aVnot to cut the trees down.
p307
aVAnd Conservation International had struck some of those deals.
p308
aVSo I went to Conservation International
p309
aVand brought them in as a partner
p310
aVand went through the process
p311
aVof valuing the fishery resource,
p312
aVdeciding how much Kiribati should be compensated,
p313
aVwhat the range of the fishes were,
p314
aVbrought in a whole bunch of other partners \u2014
p315
aVthe government of Australia,
p316
aVthe government of New Zealand, the World Bank.
p317
aVThe Oak Foundation and National Geographic
p318
aVhave been big funders of this as well.
p319
aVAnd we basically founded the park
p320
aVon the idea of an endowment
p321
aVthat would pay the equivalent lost fishing license fees
p322
aVto this very poor country
p323
aVto keep the area intact.
p324
aa(lp325
VHalfway through this process, I met the president of Kiribati,
p326
aVPresident Anote Tong.
p327
aVHe's a really important leader,
p328
aVa real visionary, forward-thinking man,
p329
aVand he told me two things when I approached him.
p330
aVHe said, "Greg, there's two things I'd like you to do.
p331
aVOne is, remember I'm a politician,
p332
aVso you've got to go out and work with my ministers
p333
aVand convince the people of Kiribati that this is a good idea.
p334
aVSecondly, I'd like you to create principles
p335
aVthat will transcend my own presidency.
p336
aVI don't want to do something like this
p337
aVif it's going to go away after I'm voted out of office."
p338
aVSo we had very strong leadership, very good vision
p339
aVand a lot of science, a lot of lawyers involved.
p340
aVMany, many steps were taken to pull this off.
p341
aVAnd it was primarily because Kiribati realized
p342
aVthat this was in their own self-interest to do this.
p343
aVThey realized that this was a common cause
p344
aVthat they had found
p345
aVwith the conservation community.
p346
aa(lp347
VThen in 2002,
p348
aVwhen this was all going full-swing,
p349
aVa coral-bleaching event happened in the Phoenix Islands.
p350
aVHere's this resource that we're looking to save,
p351
aVand it turns out it's the hottest heating event
p352
aVthat we can find on record.
p353
aVThe ocean heated up as it does sometimes,
p354
aVand the hot spot formed and stalled
p355
aVright over the Phoenix Islands for six months.
p356
aVIt was over 32 degrees Celsius for six months
p357
aVand it basically killed
p358
aV60 percent of the coral.
p359
aVSo suddenly we had this area that we were protecting,
p360
aVbut now it appeared to be dead, at least in the coral areas.
p361
aVOf course the deep-sea areas and the open ocean areas were fine,
p362
aVbut the coral, which everybody likes to look at, was in trouble.
p363
aVWell, the good news is it's recovered
p364
aVand recovering fast,
p365
aVfaster than any reef we've seen.
p366
aVThis picture was just taken by Brian Skerry a few months ago
p367
aVwhen we returned to the Phoenix Islands
p368
aVand discovered that, because it is a protected area
p369
aVand has healthy fish populations
p370
aVthat keep the algae grazed down
p371
aVand keep the rest of the reef healthy,
p372
aVthe coral is booming, is just booming back.
p373
aVIt's almost like if a person
p374
aVhas multiple diseases,
p375
aVit's hard to get well, you might die,
p376
aVbut if you only have one disease to deal with, you can get better.
p377
aVAnd that's the story with climate-change heating.
p378
aVIt's the only threat,
p379
aVthe only influence that the reef had to deal with.
p380
aVThere was no fishing, there was no pollution, there was no coastal development,
p381
aVand the reef is on a full-bore recovery.
p382
aa(lp383
VNow I remember that dinner I had with the Minister of Fisheries 10 years ago
p384
aVwhen we first brought this up and I got quite animated during the dinner
p385
aVand said, "Well, I think that the conservation community
p386
aVmight embrace this idea, Minister."
p387
aVHe paused and put his hands together and said,
p388
aV"Yes, Greg,
p389
aVbut the devil will be in the details," he said.
p390
aVAnd it certainly was.
p391
aVThe last 10 years have been detail after detail
p392
aVranging from creating legislation
p393
aVto multiple research expeditions
p394
aVto communication plans,
p395
aVas I said, teams of lawyers,
p396
aVMOUs,
p397
aVcreating the Phoenix Islands Trust Board.
p398
aVAnd we are now in the process of raising the full endowment.
p399
aVKiribati has frozen extracting activities
p400
aVat its current state while we raise the endowment.
p401
aVWe just had our first PIPA Trust Board meeting three weeks ago.
p402
aVSo it's a fully functional
p403
aVup-and-running entity
p404
aVthat negotiates the reverse fishing license with the country.
p405
aVAnd the PIPA Trust Board holds that license
p406
aVand pays the country for this.
p407
aVSo it's a very solid, very well thought-out,
p408
aVvery well grounded system,
p409
aVand it was a bottom-up system,
p410
aVand that was very important with this work,
p411
aVfrom the bottom up to secure this.
p412
aVSo the conditions for success here are listed.
p413
aVYou can read them yourselves.
p414
aVBut I would say the most important one in my mind
p415
aVwas working within the market forces
p416
aVof the situation.
p417
aVAnd that insured that we could move this forward
p418
aVand it would have both the self-interest of Kiribati
p419
aVas well as the self-interest of the world.
p420
aa(lp421
VAnd I'll leave you with one final slide,
p422
aVthat is: how do we scale this up?
p423
aVHow do we realize Sylvia's dream?
p424
aVWhere eventually do we take this?
p425
aVHere's the Pacific
p426
aVwith large MPAs
p427
aVand large conservation zones on it.
p428
aVAnd as you can see,
p429
aVwe have a patchwork across this ocean.
p430
aVI've just described to you the one story
p431
aVbehind that rectangular area in the middle, the Phoenix Islands,
p432
aVbut every other green patch on that
p433
aVhas its own story.
p434
aVAnd what we need to do now
p435
aVis look at the whole Pacific Ocean
p436
aVin its entirety
p437
aVand make a network of MPAs
p438
aVacross the Pacific
p439
aVso that we have our world's largest ocean
p440
aVprotected and self-sustaining
p441
aVover time.
p442
aa(lp443
VThank you very much. (Applause)
