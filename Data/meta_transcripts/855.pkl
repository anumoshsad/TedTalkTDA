VCan I ask you to please recall a time
p4
aVwhen you really loved something \u2014
p5
aVa movie, an album, a song or a book \u2014
p6
aVand you recommended it wholeheartedly
p7
aVto someone you also really liked,
p8
aVand you anticipated that reaction, you waited for it,
p9
aVand it came back, and the person hated it?
p10
aVSo, by way of introduction,
p11
aVthat is the exact same state
p12
aVin which I spent every working day of the last six years. (Laughter)
p13
aVI teach high school math.
p14
aVI sell a product to a market
p15
aVthat doesn't want it, but is forced by law to buy it.
p16
aVI mean, it's just a losing proposition.
p17
aa(lp18
VSo there's a useful stereotype about students that I see,
p19
aVa useful stereotype about you all.
p20
aVI could give you guys
p21
aVan algebra-two final exam,
p22
aVand I would expect no higher
p23
aVthan a 25 percent pass rate.
p24
aVAnd both of these facts say less about you or my students
p25
aVthan they do about what we call math education
p26
aVin the U.S. today.
p27
aa(lp28
VTo start with, I'd like to break math down into two categories.
p29
aVOne is computation; this is the stuff you've forgotten.
p30
aVFor example, factoring quadratics with
p31
aVleading coefficients greater than one.
p32
aVThis stuff is also really easy to relearn,
p33
aVprovided you have a really strong grounding
p34
aVin reasoning. Math reasoning \u2014
p35
aVwe'll call it the application
p36
aVof math processes to the world around us \u2014
p37
aVthis is hard to teach.
p38
aVThis is what we would love students to retain,
p39
aVeven if they don't go into mathematical fields.
p40
aVThis is also something that, the way we teach it in the U.S.
p41
aVall but ensures they won't retain it.
p42
aVSo, I'd like to talk about why that is,
p43
aVwhy that's such a calamity for society, what we can do about it
p44
aVand, to close with, why this is an amazing time
p45
aVto be a math teacher.
p46
aa(lp47
VSo first, five symptoms
p48
aVthat you're doing math reasoning wrong
p49
aVin your classroom.
p50
aVOne is a lack of initiative; your students don't self-start.
p51
aVYou finish your lecture block
p52
aVand immediately you have five hands going up
p53
aVasking you to re-explain the entire thing at their desks.
p54
aVStudents lack perseverance.
p55
aVThey lack retention; you find yourself
p56
aVre-explaining concepts three months later, wholesale.
p57
aVThere's an aversion to word problems,
p58
aVwhich describes 99 percent of my students.
p59
aVAnd then the other one percent
p60
aVis eagerly looking for the formula
p61
aVto apply in that situation.
p62
aVThis is really destructive.
p63
aa(lp64
VDavid Milch, creator of "Deadwood" and other amazing TV shows,
p65
aVhas a really good description for this.
p66
aVHe swore off creating
p67
aVcontemporary drama,
p68
aVshows set in the present day,
p69
aVbecause he saw that when people fill their mind
p70
aVwith four hours a day of, for example, "Two and a Half Men," no disrespect,
p71
aVit shapes the neural pathways, he said,
p72
aVin such a way that they expect simple problems.
p73
aVHe called it, "an impatience with irresolution."
p74
aVYou're impatient with things that don't resolve quickly.
p75
aVYou expect sitcom-sized problems that wrap up in 22 minutes,
p76
aVthree commercial breaks and a laugh track.
p77
aVAnd I'll put it to all of you,
p78
aVwhat you already know, that no problem worth solving is that simple.
p79
aVI am very concerned about this
p80
aVbecause I'm going to retire in a world that my students will run.
p81
aVI'm doing bad things
p82
aVto my own future and well-being
p83
aVwhen I teach this way.
p84
aVI'm here to tell you that the way our textbooks \u2014 particularly
p85
aVmass-adopted textbooks \u2014 teach math reasoning
p86
aVand patient problem solving,
p87
aVit's functionally equivalent to turning on "Two and a Half Men" and calling it a day.
p88
aa(lp89
V(Laughter)
p90
aa(lp91
VIn all seriousness. Here's an example from a physics textbook.
p92
aVIt applies equally to math.
p93
aVNotice, first of all here,
p94
aVthat you have exactly three pieces of information there,
p95
aVeach of which will figure into a formula
p96
aVsomewhere, eventually,
p97
aVwhich the student will then compute.
p98
aVI believe in real life.
p99
aVAnd ask yourself, what problem have you solved, ever,
p100
aVthat was worth solving
p101
aVwhere you knew all of the given information in advance;
p102
aVwhere you didn't have a surplus of information and you had to filter it out,
p103
aVor you didn't have sufficient information
p104
aVand had to go find some.
p105
aVI'm sure we all agree that no problem worth solving is like that.
p106
aVAnd the textbook, I think, knows how it's hamstringing students
p107
aVbecause, watch this, this is the practice problem set.
p108
aVWhen it comes time to do the actual problem set,
p109
aVwe have problems like this right here
p110
aVwhere we're just swapping out numbers and tweaking the context a little bit.
p111
aVAnd if the student still doesn't recognize the stamp this was molded from,
p112
aVit helpfully explains to you
p113
aVwhat sample problem you can return to to find the formula.
p114
aVYou could literally, I mean this,
p115
aVpass this particular unit without knowing any physics,
p116
aVjust knowing how to decode a textbook. That's a shame.
p117
aa(lp118
VSo I can diagnose the problem a little more specifically in math.
p119
aVHere's a really cool problem. I like this.
p120
aVIt's about defining steepness and slope
p121
aVusing a ski lift.
p122
aVBut what you have here is actually four separate layers,
p123
aVand I'm curious which of you can see the four separate layers
p124
aVand, particularly, how when they're compressed together
p125
aVand presented to the student all at once,
p126
aVhow that creates this impatient problem solving.
p127
aVI'll define them here: You have the visual.
p128
aVYou also have the mathematical structure,
p129
aVtalking about grids, measurements, labels,
p130
aVpoints, axes, that sort of thing.
p131
aVYou have substeps, which all lead to what we really want to talk about:
p132
aVwhich section is the steepest.
p133
aa(lp134
VSo I hope you can see.
p135
aVI really hope you can see how what we're doing here
p136
aVis taking a compelling question, a compelling answer,
p137
aVbut we're paving a smooth, straight path
p138
aVfrom one to the other
p139
aVand congratulating our students for how well
p140
aVthey can step over the small cracks in the way.
p141
aVThat's all we're doing here.
p142
aVSo I want to put to you that if we can separate these in a different way
p143
aVand build them up with students,
p144
aVwe can have everything we're looking for in terms of patient problem solving.
p145
aa(lp146
VSo right here I start with the visual,
p147
aVand I immediately ask the question:
p148
aVWhich section is the steepest?
p149
aVAnd this starts conversation
p150
aVbecause the visual is created in such a way where you can defend two answers.
p151
aVSo you get people arguing against each other,
p152
aVfriend versus friend,
p153
aVin pairs, journaling, whatever.
p154
aVAnd then eventually we realize
p155
aVit's getting annoying to talk about
p156
aVthe skier in the lower left-hand side of the screen
p157
aVor the skier just above the mid line.
p158
aVAnd we realize how great would it be
p159
aVif we just had some A, B, C and D labels
p160
aVto talk about them more easily.
p161
aVAnd then as we start to define what does steepness mean,
p162
aVwe realize it would be nice to have some measurements
p163
aVto really narrow it down, specifically what that means.
p164
aVAnd then and only then,
p165
aVwe throw down that mathematical structure.
p166
aVThe math serves the conversation,
p167
aVthe conversation doesn't serve the math.
p168
aVAnd at that point, I'll put it to you that nine out of 10 classes
p169
aVare good to go on the whole slope, steepness thing.
p170
aVBut if you need to,
p171
aVyour students can then develop those substeps together.
p172
aa(lp173
VDo you guys see how this, right here, compared to that \u2014
p174
aVwhich one creates that patient problem solving, that math reasoning?
p175
aVIt's been obvious in my practice, to me.
p176
aVAnd I'll yield the floor here for a second to Einstein,
p177
aVwho, I believe, has paid his dues.
p178
aVHe talked about the formulation of a problem being so incredibly important,
p179
aVand yet in my practice, in the U.S. here,
p180
aVwe just give problems to students;
p181
aVwe don't involve them in the formulation of the problem.
p182
aa(lp183
VSo 90 percent of what I do
p184
aVwith my five hours of prep time per week
p185
aVis to take fairly compelling elements
p186
aVof problems like this from my textbook
p187
aVand rebuild them in a way that supports math reasoning and patient problem solving.
p188
aVAnd here's how it works.
p189
aVI like this question. It's about a water tank.
p190
aVThe question is: How long will it take you to fill it up?
p191
aVFirst things first, we eliminate all the substeps.
p192
aVStudents have to develop those,
p193
aVthey have to formulate those.
p194
aVAnd then notice that all the information written on there is stuff you'll need.
p195
aVNone of it's a distractor, so we lose that.
p196
aVStudents need to decide, "All right, well,
p197
aVdoes the height matter? Does the side of it matter?
p198
aVDoes the color of the valve matter? What matters here?"
p199
aVSuch an underrepresented question in math curriculum.
p200
aVSo now we have a water tank.
p201
aVHow long will it take you to fill it up? And that's it.
p202
aa(lp203
VAnd because this is the 21st century
p204
aVand we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms,
p205
aVnot in terms of line art or clip art
p206
aVthat you so often see in textbooks,
p207
aVwe go out and we take a picture of it.
p208
aVSo now we have the real deal.
p209
aVHow long will it take it to fill it up?
p210
aVAnd then even better is we take a video,
p211
aVa video of someone filling it up.
p212
aVAnd it's filling up slowly, agonizingly slowly.
p213
aVIt's tedious.
p214
aVStudents are looking at their watches, rolling their eyes,
p215
aVand they're all wondering at some point or another,
p216
aV"Man, how long is it going to take to fill up?"
p217
aV(Laughter)
p218
aVThat's how you know you've baited the hook, right?
p219
aa(lp220
VAnd that question, off this right here, is really fun for me
p221
aVbecause, like the intro,
p222
aVI teach kids \u2014 because of my inexperience \u2014
p223
aVI teach the kids that are the most remedial, all right?
p224
aVAnd I've got kids who will not join a conversation about math
p225
aVbecause someone else has the formula;
p226
aVsomeone else knows how to work the formula better than me,
p227
aVso I won't talk about it.
p228
aVBut here, every student is on a level playing field of intuition.
p229
aVEveryone's filled something up with water before,
p230
aVso I get kids answering the question, "How long will it take?"
p231
aVI've got kids who are mathematically and conversationally intimidated
p232
aVjoining the conversation.
p233
aVWe put names on the board, attach them to guesses,
p234
aVand kids have bought in here.
p235
aVAnd then we follow the process I've described.
p236
aVAnd the best part here, or one of the better parts
p237
aVis that we don't get our answer from the answer key
p238
aVin the back of the teacher's edition.
p239
aVWe, instead, just watch the end of the movie.
p240
aV(Laughter)
p241
aVAnd that's terrifying,
p242
aVbecause the theoretical models that always work out
p243
aVin the answer key in the back of a teacher's edition,
p244
aVthat's great, but
p245
aVit's scary to talk about sources of error
p246
aVwhen the theoretical does not match up with the practical.
p247
aVBut those conversations have been so valuable,
p248
aVamong the most valuable.
p249
aa(lp250
VSo I'm here to report some really fun games
p251
aVwith students who come pre-installed
p252
aVwith these viruses day one of the class.
p253
aVThese are the kids who now, one semester in,
p254
aVI can put something on the board,
p255
aVtotally new, totally foreign,
p256
aVand they'll have a conversation about it for three or four minutes more
p257
aVthan they would have at the start of the year,
p258
aVwhich is just so fun.
p259
aVWe're no longer averse to word problems,
p260
aVbecause we've redefined what a word problem is.
p261
aVWe're no longer intimidated by math,
p262
aVbecause we're slowly redefining what math is.
p263
aVThis has been a lot of fun.
p264
aa(lp265
VI encourage math teachers I talk to to use multimedia,
p266
aVbecause it brings the real world into your classroom
p267
aVin high resolution and full color;
p268
aVto encourage student intuition for that level playing field;
p269
aVto ask the shortest question you possibly can
p270
aVand let those more specific questions come out in conversation;
p271
aVto let students build the problem,
p272
aVbecause Einstein said so;
p273
aVand to finally, in total, just be less helpful,
p274
aVbecause the textbook is helping you in all the wrong ways:
p275
aVIt's buying you out of your obligation,
p276
aVfor patient problem solving and math reasoning, to be less helpful.
p277
aa(lp278
VAnd why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher right now
p279
aVis because we have the tools to create
p280
aVthis high-quality curriculum in our front pocket.
p281
aVIt's ubiquitous and fairly cheap,
p282
aVand the tools to distribute it
p283
aVfreely under open licenses
p284
aVhas also never been cheaper or more ubiquitous.
p285
aVI put a video series on my blog not so long ago
p286
aVand it got 6,000 views in two weeks.
p287
aVI get emails still from teachers in countries I've never visited
p288
aVsaying, "Wow, yeah. We had a good conversation about that.
p289
aVOh, and by the way, here's how I made your stuff better,"
p290
aVwhich, wow.
p291
aVI put this problem on my blog recently:
p292
aVIn a grocery store, which line do you get into,
p293
aVthe one that has one cart and 19 items
p294
aVor the line with four carts and three, five, two and one items.
p295
aVAnd the linear modeling involved in that was some good stuff for my classroom,
p296
aVbut it eventually got me on "Good Morning America" a few weeks later,
p297
aVwhich is just bizarre, right?
p298
aa(lp299
VAnd from all of this, I can only conclude
p300
aVthat people, not just students,
p301
aVare really hungry for this.
p302
aVMath makes sense of the world.
p303
aVMath is the vocabulary
p304
aVfor your own intuition.
p305
aVSo I just really encourage you, whatever your stake is in education \u2014
p306
aVwhether you're a student, parent, teacher, policy maker, whatever \u2014
p307
aVinsist on better math curriculum.
p308
aVWe need more patient problem solvers. Thank you. (Applause)
