VThis is my grandfather.
p4
aVAnd this is my son.
p5
aVMy grandfather taught me to work with wood
p6
aVwhen I was a little boy,
p7
aVand he also taught me the idea that
p8
aVif you cut down a tree to turn it into something,
p9
aVhonor that tree's life and make it as beautiful
p10
aVas you possibly can.
p11
aVMy little boy reminded me
p12
aVthat for all the technology and all the toys in the world,
p13
aVsometimes just a small block of wood,
p14
aVif you stack it up tall,
p15
aVactually is an incredibly inspiring thing.
p16
aVThese are my buildings.
p17
aVI build all around the world
p18
aVout of our office in Vancouver and New York.
p19
aVAnd we build buildings of different sizes and styles
p20
aVand different materials, depending on where we are.
p21
aVBut wood is the material that I love the most,
p22
aVand I'm going to tell you the story about wood.
p23
aVAnd part of the reason I love it is that every time
p24
aVpeople go into my buildings that are wood,
p25
aVI notice they react completely differently.
p26
aVI've never seen anybody walk into one of my buildings
p27
aVand hug a steel or a concrete column,
p28
aVbut I've actually seen that happen in a wood building.
p29
aVI've actually seen how people touch the wood,
p30
aVand I think there's a reason for it.
p31
aVJust like snowflakes, no two pieces of wood
p32
aVcan ever be the same anywhere on Earth.
p33
aVThat's a wonderful thing.
p34
aVI like to think that wood
p35
aVgives Mother Nature fingerprints in our buildings.
p36
aVIt's Mother Nature's fingerprints that make
p37
aVour buildings connect us to nature in the built environment.
p38
aVNow, I live in Vancouver, near a forest
p39
aVthat grows to 33 stories tall.
p40
aVDown the coast here in California, the redwood forest
p41
aVgrows to 40 stories tall.
p42
aVBut the buildings that we think about in wood
p43
aVare only four stories tall in most places on Earth.
p44
aVEven building codes actually limit the ability for us to build
p45
aVmuch taller than four stories in many places,
p46
aVand that's true here in the United States.
p47
aVNow there are exceptions,
p48
aVbut there needs to be some exceptions,
p49
aVand things are going to change, I'm hoping.
p50
aVAnd the reason I think that way is that
p51
aVtoday half of us live in cities,
p52
aVand that number is going to grow to 75 percent.
p53
aVCities and density mean that our buildings
p54
aVare going to continue to be big,
p55
aVand I think there's a role for wood to play in cities.
p56
aVAnd I feel that way because three billion people
p57
aVin the world today, over the next 20 years,
p58
aVwill need a new home.
p59
aVThat's 40 percent of the world that are going to need
p60
aVa new building built for them in the next 20 years.
p61
aVNow, one in three people living in cities today
p62
aVactually live in a slum.
p63
aVThat's one billion people in the world live in slums.
p64
aVA hundred million people in the world are homeless.
p65
aVThe scale of the challenge for architects
p66
aVand for society to deal with in building
p67
aVis to find a solution to house these people.
p68
aVBut the challenge is, as we move to cities,
p69
aVcities are built in these two materials,
p70
aVsteel and concrete, and they're great materials.
p71
aVThey're the materials of the last century.
p72
aVBut they're also materials with very high energy
p73
aVand very high greenhouse gas emissions in their process.
p74
aVSteel represents about three percent
p75
aVof man's greenhouse gas emissions,
p76
aVand concrete is over five percent.
p77
aVSo if you think about that, eight percent
p78
aVof our contribution to greenhouse gases today
p79
aVcomes from those two materials alone.
p80
aVWe don't think about it a lot, and unfortunately,
p81
aVwe actually don't even think about buildings, I think,
p82
aVas much as we should.
p83
aVThis is a U.S. statistic about the impact of greenhouse gases.
p84
aVAlmost half of our greenhouse gases are related to the building industry,
p85
aVand if we look at energy, it's the same story.
p86
aVYou'll notice that transportation's sort of second down that list,
p87
aVbut that's the conversation we mostly hear about.
p88
aVAnd although a lot of that is about energy,
p89
aVit's also so much about carbon.
p90
aVThe problem I see is that, ultimately,
p91
aVthe clash of how we solve that problem
p92
aVof serving those three billion people that need a home,
p93
aVand climate change, are a head-on collision
p94
aVabout to happen, or already happening.
p95
aVThat challenge means that we have to start thinking in new ways,
p96
aVand I think wood is going to be part of that solution,
p97
aVand I'm going to tell you the story of why.
p98
aVAs an architect, wood is the only material,
p99
aVbig material, that I can build with
p100
aVthat's already grown by the power of the sun.
p101
aVWhen a tree grows in the forest and gives off oxygen
p102
aVand soaks up carbon dioxide,
p103
aVand it dies and it falls to the forest floor,
p104
aVit gives that carbon dioxide back to the atmosphere or into the ground.
p105
aVIf it burns in a forest fire, it's going to give that carbon
p106
aVback to the atmosphere as well.
p107
aVBut if you take that wood and you put it into a building
p108
aVor into a piece of furniture or into that wooden toy,
p109
aVit actually has an amazing capacity
p110
aVto store the carbon and provide us with a sequestration.
p111
aVOne cubic meter of wood will store
p112
aVone tonne of carbon dioxide.
p113
aVNow our two solutions to climate are obviously
p114
aVto reduce our emissions and find storage.
p115
aVWood is the only major material building material
p116
aVI can build with that actually does both those two things.
p117
aVSo I believe that we have
p118
aVan ethic that the Earth grows our food,
p119
aVand we need to move to an ethic in this century
p120
aVthat the Earth should grow our homes.
p121
aVNow, how are we going to do that
p122
aVwhen we're urbanizing at this rate
p123
aVand we think about wood buildings only at four stories?
p124
aVWe need to reduce the concrete and steel and we need
p125
aVto grow bigger, and what we've been working on
p126
aVis 30-story tall buildings made of wood.
p127
aVWe've been engineering them with an engineer
p128
aVnamed Eric Karsh who works with me on it,
p129
aVand we've been doing this new work because
p130
aVthere are new wood products out there for us to use,
p131
aVand we call them mass timber panels.
p132
aVThese are panels made with young trees,
p133
aVsmall growth trees, small pieces of wood
p134
aVglued together to make panels that are enormous:
p135
aVeight feet wide, 64 feet long, and of various thicknesses.
p136
aVThe way I describe this best, I've found, is to say
p137
aVthat we're all used to two-by-four construction
p138
aVwhen we think about wood.
p139
aVThat's what people jump to as a conclusion.
p140
aVTwo-by-four construction is sort of like the little
p141
aVeight-dot bricks of Lego that we all played with as kids,
p142
aVand you can make all kinds of cool things out of Lego
p143
aVat that size, and out of two-by-fours.
p144
aVBut do remember when you were a kid,
p145
aVand you kind of sifted through the pile in your basement,
p146
aVand you found that big 24-dot brick of Lego,
p147
aVand you were kind of like,
p148
aV"Cool, this is awesome. I can build something really big,
p149
aVand this is going to be great."
p150
aVThat's the change.
p151
aVMass timber panels are those 24-dot bricks.
p152
aVThey're changing the scale of what we can do,
p153
aVand what we've developed is something we call FFTT,
p154
aVwhich is a Creative Commons solution
p155
aVto building a very flexible system
p156
aVof building with these large panels where we tilt up
p157
aVsix stories at a time if we want to.
p158
aVThis animation shows you how the building goes together
p159
aVin a very simple way, but these buildings are available
p160
aVfor architects and engineers now to build on
p161
aVfor different cultures in the world,
p162
aVdifferent architectural styles and characters.
p163
aVIn order for us to build safely,
p164
aVwe've engineered these buildings, actually,
p165
aVto work in a Vancouver context,
p166
aVwhere we're a high seismic zone,
p167
aVeven at 30 stories tall.
p168
aVNow obviously, every time I bring this up,
p169
aVpeople even, you know, here at the conference, say,
p170
aV"Are you serious? Thirty stories? How's that going to happen?"
p171
aVAnd there's a lot of really good questions that are asked
p172
aVand important questions that we spent quite a long time
p173
aVworking on the answers to as we put together
p174
aVour report and the peer reviewed report.
p175
aVI'm just going to focus on a few of them,
p176
aVand let's start with fire, because I think fire
p177
aVis probably the first one that you're all thinking about right now.
p178
aVFair enough.
p179
aVAnd the way I describe it is this.
p180
aVIf I asked you to take a match and light it
p181
aVand hold up a log and try to get that log to go on fire,
p182
aVit doesn't happen, right? We all know that.
p183
aVBut to build a fire, you kind of start with small pieces
p184
aVof wood and you work your way up,
p185
aVand eventually you can add the log to the fire,
p186
aVand when you do add the log to the fire, of course,
p187
aVit burns, but it burns slowly.
p188
aVWell, mass timber panels, these new products
p189
aVthat we're using, are much like the log.
p190
aVIt's hard to start them on fire, and when they do,
p191
aVthey actually burn extraordinarily predictably,
p192
aVand we can use fire science in order to predict
p193
aVand make these buildings as safe as concrete
p194
aVand as safe as steel.
p195
aVThe next big issue, deforestation.
p196
aVEighteen percent of our contribution
p197
aVto greenhouse gas emissions worldwide
p198
aVis the result of deforestation.
p199
aVThe last thing we want to do is cut down trees.
p200
aVOr, the last thing we want to do is cut down the wrong trees.
p201
aVThere are models for sustainable forestry
p202
aVthat allow us to cut trees properly,
p203
aVand those are the only trees appropriate
p204
aVto use for these kinds of systems.
p205
aVNow I actually think that these ideas
p206
aVwill change the economics of deforestation.
p207
aVIn countries with deforestation issues,
p208
aVwe need to find a way to provide
p209
aVbetter value for the forest
p210
aVand actually encourage people to make money
p211
aVthrough very fast growth cycles \u2014
p212
aV10-, 12-, 15-year-old trees that make these products
p213
aVand allow us to build at this scale.
p214
aVWe've calculated a 20-story building:
p215
aVWe'll grow enough wood in North America every 13 minutes.
p216
aVThat's how much it takes.
p217
aVThe carbon story here is a really good one.
p218
aVIf we built a 20-story building out of cement and concrete,
p219
aVthe process would result in the manufacturing
p220
aVof that cement and 1,200 tonnes of carbon dioxide.
p221
aVIf we did it in wood, in this solution,
p222
aVwe'd sequester about 3,100 tonnes,
p223
aVfor a net difference of 4,300 tonnes.
p224
aVThat's the equivalent of about 900 cars
p225
aVremoved from the road in one year.
p226
aVThink back to that three billion people
p227
aVthat need a new home,
p228
aVand maybe this is a contributor to reducing.
p229
aVWe're at the beginning of a revolution, I hope,
p230
aVin the way we build, because this is the first new way
p231
aVto build a skyscraper in probably 100 years or more.
p232
aVBut the challenge is changing society's perception
p233
aVof possibility, and it's a huge challenge.
p234
aVThe engineering is, truthfully, the easy part of this.
p235
aVAnd the way I describe it is this.
p236
aVThe first skyscraper, technically \u2014
p237
aVand the definition of a skyscraper is 10 stories tall, believe it or not \u2014
p238
aVbut the first skyscraper was this one in Chicago,
p239
aVand people were terrified to walk underneath this building.
p240
aVBut only four years after it was built,
p241
aVGustave Eiffel was building the Eiffel Tower,
p242
aVand as he built the Eiffel Tower,
p243
aVhe changed the skylines of the cities of the world,
p244
aVchanged and created a competition
p245
aVbetween places like New York City and Chicago,
p246
aVwhere developers started building bigger and bigger buildings
p247
aVand pushing the envelope up higher and higher
p248
aVwith better and better engineering.
p249
aVWe built this model in New York, actually,
p250
aVas a theoretical model on the campus
p251
aVof a technical university soon to come,
p252
aVand the reason we picked this site
p253
aVto just show you what these buildings may look like,
p254
aVbecause the exterior can change.
p255
aVIt's really just the structure that we're talking about.
p256
aVThe reason we picked it is because this is a technical university,
p257
aVand I believe that wood is the most
p258
aVtechnologically advanced material I can build with.
p259
aVIt just happens to be that Mother Nature holds the patent,
p260
aVand we don't really feel comfortable with it.
p261
aVBut that's the way it should be,
p262
aVnature's fingerprints in the built environment.
p263
aVI'm looking for this opportunity
p264
aVto create an Eiffel Tower moment, we call it.
p265
aVBuildings are starting to go up around the world.
p266
aVThere's a building in London that's nine stories,
p267
aVa new building that just finished in Australia
p268
aVthat I believe is 10 or 11.
p269
aVWe're starting to push the height up of these wood buildings,
p270
aVand we're hoping, and I'm hoping,
p271
aVthat my hometown of Vancouver actually potentially
p272
aVannounces the world's tallest at around 20 stories
p273
aVin the not-so-distant future.
p274
aVThat Eiffel Tower moment will break the ceiling,
p275
aVthese arbitrary ceilings of height,
p276
aVand allow wood buildings to join the competition.
p277
aVAnd I believe the race is ultimately on.
p278
aVThank you.
