VI'm here to talk about
p4
aVthe wonder and the mystery
p5
aVof conscious minds.
p6
aVThe wonder is about the fact
p7
aVthat we all woke up this morning
p8
aVand we had with it
p9
aVthe amazing return of our conscious mind.
p10
aVWe recovered minds with a complete sense of self
p11
aVand a complete sense of our own existence,
p12
aVyet we hardly ever pause to consider this wonder.
p13
aVWe should, in fact,
p14
aVbecause without having this possibility of conscious minds,
p15
aVwe would have no knowledge whatsoever
p16
aVabout our humanity;
p17
aVwe would have no knowledge whatsoever about the world.
p18
aVWe would have no pains, but also no joys.
p19
aVWe would have no access to love
p20
aVor to the ability to create.
p21
aVAnd of course, Scott Fitzgerald said famously
p22
aVthat "he who invented consciousness
p23
aVwould have a lot to be blamed for."
p24
aVBut he also forgot
p25
aVthat without consciousness,
p26
aVhe would have no access to true happiness
p27
aVand even the possibility of transcendence.
p28
aa(lp29
VSo much for the wonder, now for the mystery.
p30
aVThis is a mystery
p31
aVthat has really been extremely hard to elucidate.
p32
aVAll the way back into early philosophy
p33
aVand certainly throughout the history of neuroscience,
p34
aVthis has been one mystery
p35
aVthat has always resisted elucidation,
p36
aVhas got major controversies.
p37
aVAnd there are actually many people
p38
aVthat think we should not even touch it;
p39
aVwe should just leave it alone, it's not to be solved.
p40
aVI don't believe that,
p41
aVand I think the situation is changing.
p42
aVIt would be ridiculous to claim
p43
aVthat we know how we make consciousness
p44
aVin our brains,
p45
aVbut we certainly can begin
p46
aVto approach the question,
p47
aVand we can begin to see the shape of a solution.
p48
aa(lp49
VAnd one more wonder to celebrate
p50
aVis the fact that we have imaging technologies
p51
aVthat now allow us to go inside the human brain
p52
aVand be able to do, for example,
p53
aVwhat you're seeing right now.
p54
aVThese are images that come from Hanna Damasio's lab,
p55
aVand which show you, in a living brain,
p56
aVthe reconstruction of that brain.
p57
aVAnd this is a person who is alive.
p58
aVThis is not a person
p59
aVthat is being studied at autopsy.
p60
aVAnd even more \u2014
p61
aVand this is something that one can be really amazed about \u2014
p62
aVis what I'm going to show you next,
p63
aVwhich is going underneath the surface of the brain
p64
aVand actually looking in the living brain
p65
aVat real connections, real pathways.
p66
aVSo all of those colored lines
p67
aVcorrespond to bunches of axons,
p68
aVthe fibers that join cell bodies
p69
aVto synapses.
p70
aVAnd I'm sorry to disappoint you, they don't come in color.
p71
aVBut at any rate, they are there.
p72
aVThe colors are codes for the direction,
p73
aVfrom whether it is back to front
p74
aVor vice versa.
p75
aa(lp76
VAt any rate, what is consciousness?
p77
aVWhat is a conscious mind?
p78
aVAnd we could take a very simple view
p79
aVand say, well, it is that which we lose
p80
aVwhen we fall into deep sleep without dreams,
p81
aVor when we go under anesthesia,
p82
aVand it is what we regain
p83
aVwhen we recover from sleep
p84
aVor from anesthesia.
p85
aVBut what is exactly that stuff that we lose under anesthesia,
p86
aVor when we are in deep, dreamless sleep?
p87
aVWell first of all,
p88
aVit is a mind,
p89
aVwhich is a flow of mental images.
p90
aVAnd of course consider images
p91
aVthat can be sensory patterns,
p92
aVvisual, such as you're having right now
p93
aVin relation to the stage and me,
p94
aVor auditory images,
p95
aVas you are having now in relation to my words.
p96
aVThat flow of mental images
p97
aVis mind.
p98
aa(lp99
VBut there is something else
p100
aVthat we are all experiencing in this room.
p101
aVWe are not passive exhibitors
p102
aVof visual or auditory
p103
aVor tactile images.
p104
aVWe have selves.
p105
aVWe have a Me
p106
aVthat is automatically present
p107
aVin our minds right now.
p108
aVWe own our minds.
p109
aVAnd we have a sense that it's everyone of us
p110
aVthat is experiencing this \u2014
p111
aVnot the person who is sitting next to you.
p112
aVSo in order to have a conscious mind,
p113
aVyou have a self within the conscious mind.
p114
aVSo a conscious mind is a mind with a self in it.
p115
aVThe self introduces the subjective perspective in the mind,
p116
aVand we are only fully conscious
p117
aVwhen self comes to mind.
p118
aVSo what we need to know to even address this mystery
p119
aVis, number one, how are minds are put together in the brain,
p120
aVand, number two, how selves are constructed.
p121
aa(lp122
VNow the first part, the first problem,
p123
aVis relatively easy \u2014 it's not easy at all \u2014
p124
aVbut it is something that has been approached gradually in neuroscience.
p125
aVAnd it's quite clear that, in order to make minds,
p126
aVwe need to construct neural maps.
p127
aVSo imagine a grid, like the one I'm showing you right now,
p128
aVand now imagine, within that grid,
p129
aVthat two-dimensional sheet,
p130
aVimagine neurons.
p131
aVAnd picture, if you will,
p132
aVa billboard, a digital billboard,
p133
aVwhere you have elements
p134
aVthat can be either lit or not.
p135
aVAnd depending on how you create the pattern
p136
aVof lighting or not lighting,
p137
aVthe digital elements,
p138
aVor, for that matter, the neurons in the sheet,
p139
aVyou're going to be able to construct a map.
p140
aVThis, of course, is a visual map that I'm showing you,
p141
aVbut this applies to any kind of map \u2014
p142
aVauditory, for example, in relation to sound frequencies,
p143
aVor to the maps that we construct with our skin
p144
aVin relation to an object that we palpate.
p145
aa(lp146
VNow to bring home the point
p147
aVof how close it is \u2014
p148
aVthe relationship between the grid of neurons
p149
aVand the topographical arrangement
p150
aVof the activity of the neurons
p151
aVand our mental experience \u2014
p152
aVI'm going to tell you a personal story.
p153
aVSo if I cover my left eye \u2014
p154
aVI'm talking about me personally, not all of you \u2014
p155
aVif I cover my left eye,
p156
aVI look at the grid \u2014 pretty much like the one I'm showing you.
p157
aVEverything is nice and fine and perpendicular.
p158
aVBut sometime ago, I discovered
p159
aVthat if I cover my left eye,
p160
aVinstead what I get is this.
p161
aVI look at the grid and I see a warping
p162
aVat the edge of my central-left field.
p163
aa(lp164
VVery odd \u2014 I've analyzed this for a while.
p165
aVBut sometime ago,
p166
aVthrough the help of an opthamologist colleague of mine,
p167
aVCarmen Puliafito,
p168
aVwho developed a laser scanner of the retina,
p169
aVI found out the the following.
p170
aVIf I scan my retina
p171
aVthrough the horizontal plane that you see there in the little corner,
p172
aVwhat I get is the following.
p173
aVOn the right side, my retina is perfectly symmetrical.
p174
aVYou see the going down towards the fovea
p175
aVwhere the optic nerve begins.
p176
aVBut on my left retina there is a bump,
p177
aVwhich is marked there by the red arrow.
p178
aVAnd it corresponds to a little cyst
p179
aVthat is located below.
p180
aVAnd that is exactly what causes
p181
aVthe warping of my visual image.
p182
aa(lp183
VSo just think of this:
p184
aVyou have a grid of neurons,
p185
aVand now you have a plane mechanical change
p186
aVin the position of the grid,
p187
aVand you get a warping of your mental experience.
p188
aVSo this is how close
p189
aVyour mental experience
p190
aVand the activity of the neurons in the retina,
p191
aVwhich is a part of the brain located in the eyeball,
p192
aVor, for that matter, a sheet of visual cortex.
p193
aVSo from the retina
p194
aVyou go onto visual cortex.
p195
aVAnd of course, the brain adds on
p196
aVa lot of information
p197
aVto what is going on
p198
aVin the signals that come from the retina.
p199
aVAnd in that image there,
p200
aVyou see a variety of islands
p201
aVof what I call image-making regions in the brain.
p202
aVYou have the green for example,
p203
aVthat corresponds to tactile information,
p204
aVor the blue that corresponds to auditory information.
p205
aa(lp206
VAnd something else that happens
p207
aVis that those image-making regions
p208
aVwhere you have the plotting
p209
aVof all these neural maps,
p210
aVcan then provide signals
p211
aVto this ocean of purple that you see around,
p212
aVwhich is the association cortex,
p213
aVwhere you can make records of what went on
p214
aVin those islands of image-making.
p215
aVAnd the great beauty
p216
aVis that you can then go from memory,
p217
aVout of those association cortices,
p218
aVand produce back images
p219
aVin the very same regions that have perception.
p220
aVSo think about how wonderfully convenient and lazy
p221
aVthe brain is.
p222
aVSo it provides certain areas
p223
aVfor perception and image-making.
p224
aVAnd those are exactly the same
p225
aVthat are going to be used for image-making
p226
aVwhen we recall information.
p227
aa(lp228
VSo far the mystery of the conscious mind
p229
aVis diminishing a little bit
p230
aVbecause we have a general sense
p231
aVof how we make these images.
p232
aVBut what about the self?
p233
aVThe self is really the elusive problem.
p234
aVAnd for a long time,
p235
aVpeople did not even want to touch it,
p236
aVbecause they'd say,
p237
aV"How can you have this reference point, this stability,
p238
aVthat is required to maintain
p239
aVthe continuity of selves day after day?"
p240
aVAnd I thought about a solution to this problem.
p241
aVIt's the following.
p242
aVWe generate brain maps
p243
aVof the body's interior
p244
aVand use them as the reference for all other maps.
p245
aa(lp246
VSo let me tell you just a little bit about how I came to this.
p247
aVI came to this because,
p248
aVif you're going to have a reference that we know as self \u2014
p249
aVthe Me, the I
p250
aVin our own processing \u2014
p251
aVwe need to have something that is stable,
p252
aVsomething that does not deviate much
p253
aVfrom day to day.
p254
aVWell it so happens that we have a singular body.
p255
aVWe have one body, not two, not three.
p256
aVAnd so that is a beginning.
p257
aVThere is just one reference point, which is the body.
p258
aVBut then, of course, the body has many parts,
p259
aVand things grow at different rates,
p260
aVand they have different sizes and different people;
p261
aVhowever, not so with the interior.
p262
aVThe things that have to do
p263
aVwith what is known as our internal milieu \u2014
p264
aVfor example, the whole management
p265
aVof the chemistries within our body
p266
aVare, in fact, extremely maintained
p267
aVday after day
p268
aVfor one very good reason.
p269
aVIf you deviate too much
p270
aVin the parameters
p271
aVthat are close to the midline
p272
aVof that life-permitting survival range,
p273
aVyou go into disease or death.
p274
aVSo we have an in-built system
p275
aVwithin our own lives
p276
aVthat ensures some kind of continuity.
p277
aVI like to call it an almost infinite sameness from day to day.
p278
aVBecause if you don't have that sameness, physiologically,
p279
aVyou're going to be sick or you're going to die.
p280
aVSo that's one more element for this continuity.
p281
aa(lp282
VAnd the final thing
p283
aVis that there is a very tight coupling
p284
aVbetween the regulation of our body within the brain
p285
aVand the body itself,
p286
aVunlike any other coupling.
p287
aVSo for example, I'm making images of you,
p288
aVbut there's no physiological bond
p289
aVbetween the images I have of you as an audience
p290
aVand my brain.
p291
aVHowever, there is a close, permanently maintained bond
p292
aVbetween the body regulating parts of my brain
p293
aVand my own body.
p294
aa(lp295
VSo here's how it looks. Look at the region there.
p296
aVThere is the brain stem in between the cerebral cortex
p297
aVand the spinal cord.
p298
aVAnd it is within that region
p299
aVthat I'm going to highlight now
p300
aVthat we have this housing
p301
aVof all the life-regulation devices
p302
aVof the body.
p303
aVThis is so specific that, for example,
p304
aVif you look at the part that is covered in red
p305
aVin the upper part of the brain stem,
p306
aVif you damage that as a result of a stroke, for example,
p307
aVwhat you get is coma
p308
aVor vegetative state,
p309
aVwhich is a state, of course,
p310
aVin which your mind disappears,
p311
aVyour consciousness disappears.
p312
aVWhat happens then actually
p313
aVis that you lose the grounding of the self,
p314
aVyou have no longer access to any feeling of your own existence,
p315
aVand, in fact, there can be images going on,
p316
aVbeing formed in the cerebral cortex,
p317
aVexcept you don't know they're there.
p318
aVYou have, in effect, lost consciousness
p319
aVwhen you have damage to that red section of the brain stem.
p320
aa(lp321
VBut if you consider the green part of the brain stem,
p322
aVnothing like that happens.
p323
aVIt is that specific.
p324
aVSo in that green component of the brain stem,
p325
aVif you damage it, and often it happens,
p326
aVwhat you get is complete paralysis,
p327
aVbut your conscious mind is maintained.
p328
aVYou feel, you know, you have a fully conscious mind
p329
aVthat you can report very indirectly.
p330
aVThis is a horrific condition. You don't want to see it.
p331
aVAnd people are, in fact, imprisoned
p332
aVwithin their own bodies,
p333
aVbut they do have a mind.
p334
aVThere was a very interesting film,
p335
aVone of the rare good films done
p336
aVabout a situation like this,
p337
aVby Julian Schnabel some years ago
p338
aVabout a patient that was in that condition.
p339
aa(lp340
VSo now I'm going to show you a picture.
p341
aVI promise not to say anything about this,
p342
aVexcept this is to frighten you.
p343
aVIt's just to tell you
p344
aVthat in that red section of the brain stem,
p345
aVthere are, to make it simple,
p346
aVall those little squares that correspond to modules
p347
aVthat actually make brain maps
p348
aVof different aspects of our interior,
p349
aVdifferent aspects of our body.
p350
aVThey are exquisitely topographic
p351
aVand they are exquisitely interconnected
p352
aVin a recursive pattern.
p353
aVAnd it is out of this and out of this tight coupling
p354
aVbetween the brain stem and the body
p355
aVthat I believe \u2014 and I could be wrong,
p356
aVbut I don't think I am \u2014
p357
aVthat you generate this mapping of the body
p358
aVthat provides the grounding for the self
p359
aVand that comes in the form of feelings \u2014
p360
aVprimordial feelings, by the way.
p361
aa(lp362
VSo what is the picture that we get here?
p363
aVLook at "cerebral cortex," look at "brain stem,"
p364
aVlook at "body,"
p365
aVand you get the picture of the interconnectivity
p366
aVin which you have the brain stem providing the grounding for the self
p367
aVin a very tight interconnection with the body.
p368
aVAnd you have the cerebral cortex
p369
aVproviding the great spectacle of our minds
p370
aVwith the profusion of images
p371
aVthat are, in fact, the contents of our minds
p372
aVand that we normally pay most attention to,
p373
aVas we should, because that's really
p374
aVthe film that is rolling in our minds.
p375
aVBut look at the arrows.
p376
aVThey're not there for looks.
p377
aVThey're there because there's this very close interaction.
p378
aVYou cannot have a conscious mind
p379
aVif you don't have the interaction
p380
aVbetween cerebral cortex and brain stem.
p381
aVYou cannot have a conscious mind
p382
aVif you don't have the interaction
p383
aVbetween the brain stem and the body.
p384
aa(lp385
VAnother thing that is interesting
p386
aVis that the brain stem that we have
p387
aVis shared with a variety of other species.
p388
aVSo throughout vertebrates,
p389
aVthe design of the brain stem is very similar to ours,
p390
aVwhich is one of the reasons why I think
p391
aVthose other species have conscious minds like we do.
p392
aVExcept that they're not as rich as ours,
p393
aVbecause they don't have a cerebral cortex like we do.
p394
aVThat's where the difference is.
p395
aVAnd I strongly disagree with the idea
p396
aVthat consciousness should be considered
p397
aVas the great product of the cerebral cortex.
p398
aVOnly the wealth of our minds is,
p399
aVnot the very fact that we have a self
p400
aVthat we can refer
p401
aVto our own existence,
p402
aVand that we have any sense of person.
p403
aa(lp404
VNow there are three levels of self to consider \u2014
p405
aVthe proto, the core and the autobiographical.
p406
aVThe first two are shared
p407
aVwith many, many other species,
p408
aVand they are really coming out
p409
aVlargely of the brain stem
p410
aVand whatever there is of cortex in those species.
p411
aVIt's the autobiographical self
p412
aVwhich some species have, I think.
p413
aVCetaceans and primates have also
p414
aVan autobiographical self to a certain degree.
p415
aVAnd everybody's dogs at home
p416
aVhave an autobiographical self to a certain degree.
p417
aVBut the novelty is here.
p418
aa(lp419
VThe autobiographical self is built
p420
aVon the basis of past memories
p421
aVand memories of the plans that we have made;
p422
aVit's the lived past and the anticipated future.
p423
aVAnd the autobiographical self
p424
aVhas prompted extended memory, reasoning,
p425
aVimagination, creativity and language.
p426
aVAnd out of that came the instruments of culture \u2014
p427
aVreligions, justice,
p428
aVtrade, the arts, science, technology.
p429
aVAnd it is within that culture
p430
aVthat we really can get \u2014
p431
aVand this is the novelty \u2014
p432
aVsomething that is not entirely set by our biology.
p433
aVIt is developed in the cultures.
p434
aVIt developed in collectives of human beings.
p435
aVAnd this is, of course, the culture
p436
aVwhere we have developed something that I like to call
p437
aVsocio-cultural regulation.
p438
aa(lp439
VAnd finally, you could rightly ask,
p440
aVwhy care about this?
p441
aVWhy care if it is the brain stem or the cerebral cortex
p442
aVand how this is made?
p443
aVThree reasons. First, curiosity.
p444
aVPrimates are extremely curious \u2014
p445
aVand humans most of all.
p446
aVAnd if we are interested, for example,
p447
aVin the fact that anti-gravity
p448
aVis pulling galaxies away from the Earth,
p449
aVwhy should we not be interested in what is going on
p450
aVinside of human beings?
p451
aa(lp452
VSecond, understanding society and culture.
p453
aVWe should look
p454
aVat how society and culture
p455
aVin this socio-cultural regulation
p456
aVare a work in progress.
p457
aVAnd finally, medicine.
p458
aVLet's not forget that some of the worst diseases
p459
aVof humankind
p460
aVare diseases such as depression,
p461
aVAlzheimer's disease, drug addiction.
p462
aVThink of strokes that can devastate your mind
p463
aVor render you unconscious.
p464
aVYou have no prayer
p465
aVof treating those diseases effectively
p466
aVand in a non-serendipitous way
p467
aVif you do not know how this works.
p468
aVSo that's a very good reason
p469
aVbeyond curiosity
p470
aVto justify what we're doing,
p471
aVand to justify having some interest in what is going on in our brains.
p472
