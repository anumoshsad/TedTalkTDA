VToday I am going to teach you
p4
aVhow to play my favorite game:
p5
aVmassively multiplayer thumb-wrestling.
p6
aVIt's the only game in the world that I know of
p7
aVthat allows you, the player,
p8
aVthe opportunity to experience
p9
aV10 positive emotions in 60 seconds or less.
p10
aVThis is true, so if you play this game with me today
p11
aVfor just one single minute,
p12
aVyou will get to feel joy, relief, love, surprise,
p13
aVpride, curiosity, excitement, awe and wonder,
p14
aVcontentment, and creativity,
p15
aVall in the span of one minute.
p16
aa(lp17
VSo this sounds pretty good, right? Now you're willing to play.
p18
aVIn order to teach you this game,
p19
aVI'm going to need some volunteers
p20
aVto come up onstage really quickly,
p21
aVand we're going to do a little hands-on demo.
p22
aVWhile they're coming up, I should let you know,
p23
aVthis game was invented 10 years ago
p24
aVby an artists' collective in Austria named Monochrom.
p25
aVSo thank you, Monochrom.
p26
aVOkay, so most people are familiar
p27
aVwith traditional, two-person thumb-wrestling.
p28
aVSunni, let's just remind them.
p29
aVOne, two, three, four,  I declare a thumb war, and we wrestle,
p30
aVand of course Sunni beats me because she's the best.
p31
aa(lp32
VNow the first thing about massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling,
p33
aVwe're the gamer generation.
p34
aVThere are a billion gamers on the planet now,
p35
aVso we need more of a challenge.
p36
aVSo the first thing we need is more thumbs.
p37
aVSo Eric, come on over.
p38
aVSo we could get three thumbs together,
p39
aVand Peter could join us.
p40
aVWe could even have four thumbs together,
p41
aVand the way you win
p42
aVis you're the first person to pin someone else's thumb.
p43
aVThis is really important. You can't, like,
p44
aVwait while they fight it out and then swoop in at the last minute.
p45
aVThat is not how you win.
p46
aVAh, who did that? Eric you did that.
p47
aVSo Eric would have won. He was the first person to pin my thumb.
p48
aVOkay, so that's the first rule,
p49
aVand we can see that three or four
p50
aVis kind of the typical number of thumbs in a node,
p51
aVbut if you feel ambitious, you don't have to hold back.
p52
aVWe can really go for it.
p53
aVSo you can see up here.
p54
aVNow the only other rule you need to remember is,
p55
aVgamer generation, we like a challenge.
p56
aVI happen to notice you all have
p57
aVsome thumbs you're not using.
p58
aVSo I think we should kind of get some more involved.
p59
aVAnd if we had just four people,
p60
aVwe would do it just like this,
p61
aVand we would try and wrestle
p62
aVboth thumbs at the same time.
p63
aVPerfect.
p64
aa(lp65
VNow, if we had more people in the room,
p66
aVinstead of just wrestling in a closed node,
p67
aVwe might reach out and try and grab some other people.
p68
aVAnd in fact, that's what we're going to do right now.
p69
aVWe're going to try and get all, something like,
p70
aVI don't know, 1,500 thumbs in this room
p71
aVconnected in a single node.
p72
aVAnd we have to connect both levels,
p73
aVso if you're up there, you're going to be
p74
aVreaching down and reaching up.
p75
aa(lp76
VNow \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p77
aVbefore we get started \u2014
p78
aVThis is great. You're excited to play. \u2014
p79
aVbefore we get started, can I have the slides back up here really quick,
p80
aVbecause if you get good at this game,
p81
aVI want you to know there are some advanced levels.
p82
aVSo this is the kind of simple level, right?
p83
aVBut there are advanced configurations.
p84
aVThis is called the Death Star Configuration.
p85
aVAny Star Wars fans?
p86
aVAnd this one's called the Möbius Strip.
p87
aVAny science geeks, you get that one.
p88
aVThis is the hardest level. This is the extreme.
p89
aa(lp90
VSo we'll stick with the normal one for now,
p91
aVand I'm going to give you 30 seconds,
p92
aVevery thumb into the node,
p93
aVconnect the upper and the lower levels,
p94
aVyou guys go on down there.
p95
aVThirty seconds. Into the network. Make the node.
p96
aa(lp97
VStand up! It's easier if you stand up.
p98
aVEverybody, up up up up up!
p99
aVStand up, my friends.
p100
aVAll right.
p101
aVDon't start wrestling yet.
p102
aVIf you have a free thumb, wave it around,
p103
aVmake sure it gets connected.
p104
aVOkay. We need to do a last-minute thumb check.
p105
aVIf you have a free thumb, wave it around to make sure.
p106
aVGrab that thumb!
p107
aVReach behind you. There you go.
p108
aVAny other thumbs?
p109
aVOkay, on the count of three, you're going to go.
p110
aVTry to keep track. Grab, grab, grab it.
p111
aVOkay? One, two, three, go!
p112
aa(lp113
V(Laughter)
p114
aa(lp115
VDid you win? You got it? You got it? Excellent!
p116
aV(Applause)
p117
aVWell done. Thank you. Thank you very much.
p118
aa(lp119
VAll right.
p120
aVWhile you are basking in the glow
p121
aVof having won your first
p122
aVmassively multiplayer thumb-wrestling game,
p123
aVlet's do a quick recap on the positive emotions.
p124
aVSo curiosity.
p125
aVI said "massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling."
p126
aVYou were like, "What the hell is she talking about?"
p127
aVSo I provoked a little curiosity.
p128
aVCreativity: it took creativity to solve the problem
p129
aVof getting all the thumbs into the node.
p130
aVI'm reaching around and I'm reaching up.
p131
aVSo you used creativity. That was great.
p132
aVHow about surprise? The actual feeling
p133
aVof trying to wrestle two thumbs at once is pretty surprising.
p134
aVYou heard that sound go up in the room.
p135
aVWe had excitement. As you started to wrestle,
p136
aVmaybe you're starting to win or this person's, like, really into it,
p137
aVso you kind of get the excitement going.
p138
aVWe have relief. You got to stand up.
p139
aVYou've been sitting for awhile, so the physical relief,
p140
aVgetting to shake it out.
p141
aVWe had joy. You were laughing, smiling. Look at your faces. This room is full of joy.
p142
aVWe had some contentment.
p143
aVI didn't see anybody sending text messages or checking their email while we were playing,
p144
aVso you were totally content to be playing.
p145
aVThe most important three emotions,
p146
aVawe and wonder, we had everybody connected physically for a minute.
p147
aVWhen was the last time you were at TED
p148
aVand you got to connect physically with every single person in the room?
p149
aVAnd it's truly awesome and wondrous.
p150
aVAnd speaking of physical connection,
p151
aVyou guys know I love the hormone oxytocin,
p152
aVyou release oxytocin, you feel bonded to everyone in the room.
p153
aVYou guys know that the best way to release oxytocin quickly
p154
aVis to hold someone else's hand for at least six seconds.
p155
aVYou guys were all holding hands for way more than six seconds,
p156
aVso we are all now biochemically primed
p157
aVto love each other. That is great.
p158
aa(lp159
VAnd the last emotion of pride.
p160
aVHow many people are like me. Just admit it.
p161
aVYou lost both your thumbs.
p162
aVIt just didn't work out for you.
p163
aVThat's okay, because you learned a new skill today.
p164
aVYou learned, from scratch, a game you never knew before.
p165
aVNow you know how to play it. You can teach other people.
p166
aVSo congratulations.
p167
aVHow many of you won just won thumb?
p168
aVAll right. I have very good news for you.
p169
aVAccording to the official rules
p170
aVof massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling,
p171
aVthis makes you a grandmaster of the game.
p172
aVBecause there aren't that many people who know how to play,
p173
aVwe have to kind of accelerate the program
p174
aVmore than a game like chess.
p175
aVSo congratulations, grandmasters.
p176
aVWin one thumb once, you will become a grandmaster.
p177
aVDid anybody win both their thumbs?
p178
aVYes. Awesome. Okay.

p183
aVThe best way to become a legendary grandmaster,
p184
aVyou've got your two nodes going on.
p185
aVPick off the one that looks easiest.
p186
aVThey're not paying attention. They look kind of weak.
p187
aVFocus on that one and do something crazy
p188
aVwith this arm.
p189
aVAs soon as you win, suddenly stop.
p190
aVEverybody is thrown off. You go in for the kill.
