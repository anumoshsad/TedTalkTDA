VIn many patriarchal societies and tribal societies,
p4
aVfathers are usually known by their sons,
p5
aVbut I'm one of the few fathers
p6
aVwho is known by his daughter,
p7
aVand I am proud of it.

aa(lp11
VMalala started her campaign for education
p12
aVand stood for her rights in 2007,
p13
aVand when her efforts were honored in 2011,
p14
aVand she was given the national youth peace prize,
p15
aVand she became a very famous,
p16
aVvery popular young girl of her country.
p17
aVBefore that, she was my daughter,
p18
aVbut now I am her father.
p19
aVLadies and gentlemen,
p20
aVif we glance to human history,
p21
aVthe story of women
p22
aVis the story of injustice,
p23
aVinequality,
p24
aVviolence and exploitation.
p25
aVYou see,
p26
aVin patriarchal societies,
p27
aVright from the very beginning,
p28
aVwhen a girl is born,
p29
aVher birth is not celebrated.
p30
aVShe is not welcomed,
p31
aVneither by father nor by mother.
p32
aVThe neighborhood comes
p33
aVand commiserates with the mother,
p34
aVand nobody congratulates the father.
p35
aVAnd a mother is very uncomfortable
p36
aVfor having a girl child.
p37
aVWhen she gives birth to the first girl child,
p38
aVfirst daughter, she is sad.
p39
aVWhen she gives birth to the second daughter,
p40
aVshe is shocked,
p41
aVand in the expectation of a son,
p42
aVwhen she gives birth to a third daughter,
p43
aVshe feels guilty like a criminal.
p44
aa(lp45
VNot only the mother suffers,
p46
aVbut the daughter, the newly born daughter,
p47
aVwhen she grows old,
p48
aVshe suffers too.
p49
aVAt the age of five,
p50
aVwhile she should be going to school,
p51
aVshe stays at home
p52
aVand her brothers are admitted in a school.
p53
aVUntil the age of 12, somehow,
p54
aVshe has a good life.
p55
aVShe can have fun.
p56
aVShe can play with her friends in the streets,
p57
aVand she can move around in the streets
p58
aVlike a butterfly.
p59
aVBut when she enters her teens,
p60
aVwhen she becomes 13 years old,
p61
aVshe is forbidden to go out of her home
p62
aVwithout a male escort.
p63
aVShe is confined under the four walls of her home.
p64
aVShe is no more a free individual.
p65
aVShe becomes the so-called honor
p66
aVof her father and of her brothers
p67
aVand of her family,
p68
aVand if she transgresses
p69
aVthe code of that so-called honor,
p70
aVshe could even be killed.
p71
aa(lp72
VAnd it is also interesting that this so-called
p73
aVcode of honor,
p74
aVit does not only affect the life of a girl,
p75
aVit also affects the life
p76
aVof the male members of the family.
p77
aVI know a family of seven sisters and one brother,
p78
aVand that one brother,
p79
aVhe has migrated to the Gulf countries,
p80
aVto earn a living for his seven sisters
p81
aVand parents,
p82
aVbecause he thinks that it will be humiliating
p83
aVif his seven sisters learn a skill
p84
aVand they go out of the home
p85
aVand earn some livelihood.
p86
aVSo this brother,
p87
aVhe sacrifices the joys of his life
p88
aVand the happiness of his sisters
p89
aVat the altar of so-called honor.
p90
aa(lp91
VAnd there is one more norm
p92
aVof the patriarchal societies
p93
aVthat is called obedience.
p94
aVA good girl is supposed to be
p95
aVvery quiet, very humble
p96
aVand very submissive.
p97
aVIt is the criteria.
p98
aVThe role model good girl should be very quiet.
p99
aVShe is supposed to be silent
p100
aVand she is supposed to accept the decisions
p101
aVof her father and mother
p102
aVand the decisions of elders,
p103
aVeven if she does not like them.
p104
aVIf she is married to a man she doesn't like
p105
aVor if she is married to an old man,
p106
aVshe has to accept,
p107
aVbecause she does not want to be dubbed
p108
aVas disobedient.
p109
aVIf she is married very early,
p110
aVshe has to accept.
p111
aVOtherwise, she will be called disobedient.
p112
aVAnd what happens at the end?
p113
aVIn the words of a poetess,
p114
aVshe is wedded, bedded,
p115
aVand then she gives birth to more sons and daughters.
p116
aVAnd it is the irony of the situation
p117
aVthat this mother,
p118
aVshe teaches the same lesson of obedience
p119
aVto her daughter
p120
aVand the same lesson of honor to her sons.
p121
aVAnd this vicious cycle goes on, goes on.
p122
aa(lp123
VLadies and gentlemen,
p124
aVthis plight of millions of women
p125
aVcould be changed
p126
aVif we think differently,
p127
aVif women and men think differently,
p128
aVif men and women in the tribal and patriarchal societies
p129
aVin the developing countries,
p130
aVif they can break a few norms
p131
aVof family and society,
p132
aVif they can abolish the discriminatory laws
p133
aVof the systems in their states,
p134
aVwhich go against the basic human rights
p135
aVof the women.
p136
aa(lp137
VDear brothers and sisters, when Malala was born,
p138
aVand for the first time,
p139
aVbelieve me,
p140
aVI don't like newborn children, to be honest,
p141
aVbut when I went and I looked into her eyes,
p142
aVbelieve me,
p143
aVI got extremely honored.
p144
aVAnd long before she was born,
p145
aVI thought about her name,
p146
aVand I was fascinated with a heroic
p147
aVlegendary freedom fighter in Afghanistan.
p148
aVHer name was Malalai of Maiwand,
p149
aVand I named my daughter after her.
p150
aVA few days after Malala was born,
p151
aVmy daughter was born,
p152
aVmy cousin came \u2014
p153
aVand it was a coincidence \u2014
p154
aVhe came to my home
p155
aVand he brought a family tree,
p156
aVa family tree of the Yousafzai family,
p157
aVand when I looked at the family tree,
p158
aVit traced back to 300 years of our ancestors.
p159
aVBut when I looked, all were men,
p160
aVand I picked my pen,
p161
aVdrew a line from my name,
p162
aVand wrote, "Malala."
p163
aa(lp164
VAnd when she grow old,
p165
aVwhen she was four and a half years old,
p166
aVI admitted her in my school.
p167
aVYou will be asking, then, why should I mention about
p168
aVthe admission of a girl in a school?
p169
aVYes, I must mention it.
p170
aVIt may be taken for granted in Canada,
p171
aVin America, in many developed countries,
p172
aVbut in poor countries,
p173
aVin patriarchal societies, in tribal societies,
p174
aVit's a big event for the life of girl.
p175
aVEnrollment in a school means
p176
aVrecognition of her identity and her name.
p177
aVAdmission in a school means
p178
aVthat she has entered the world of dreams
p179
aVand aspirations
p180
aVwhere she can explore her potentials
p181
aVfor her future life.
p182
aVI have five sisters,
p183
aVand none of them could go to school,
p184
aVand you will be astonished,
p185
aVtwo weeks before,
p186
aVwhen I was filling out the Canadian visa form,
p187
aVand I was filling out the family part of the form,
p188
aVI could not recall
p189
aVthe surnames of some of my sisters.
p190
aVAnd the reason was
p191
aVthat I have never, never seen the names
p192
aVof my sisters written on any document.
p193
aVThat was the reason that
p194
aVI valued my daughter.
p195
aVWhat my father could not give to my sisters
p196
aVand to his daughters,
p197
aVI thought I must change it.
p198
aa(lp199
VI used to appreciate the intelligence
p200
aVand the brilliance of my daughter.
p201
aVI encouraged her to sit with me
p202
aVwhen my friends used to come.
p203
aVI encouraged her to go with me to different meetings.
p204
aVAnd all these good values,
p205
aVI tried to inculcate in her personality.
p206
aVAnd this was not only she, only Malala.
p207
aVI imparted all these good values
p208
aVto my school, girl students  and boy students as well.
p209
aVI used education for emancipation.
p210
aVI taught my girls,
p211
aVI taught my girl students,
p212
aVto unlearn the lesson of obedience.
p213
aVI taught my boy students
p214
aVto unlearn the lesson of so-called pseudo-honor.
p215
aa(lp216
VDear brothers and sisters,
p217
aVwe were striving for more rights for women,
p218
aVand we were struggling to have more,
p219
aVmore and more space for the women in society.
p220
aVBut we came across a new phenomenon.
p221
aVIt was lethal to human rights
p222
aVand particularly to women's rights.
p223
aVIt was called Talibanization.
p224
aVIt means a complete negation
p225
aVof women's participation
p226
aVin all political, economical and social activities.
p227
aVHundreds of schools were lost.
p228
aVGirls were prohibited from going to school.
p229
aVWomen were forced to wear veils
p230
aVand they were stopped from going to the markets.
p231
aVMusicians were silenced,
p232
aVgirls were flogged
p233
aVand singers were killed.
p234
aVMillions were suffering,
p235
aVbut few spoke,
p236
aVand it was the most scary thing
p237
aVwhen you have all around such people
p238
aVwho kill and who flog,
p239
aVand you speak for your rights.
p240
aVIt's really the most scary thing.
p241
aa(lp242
VAt the age of 10,
p243
aVMalala stood, and she stood for the right
p244
aVof education.
p245
aVShe wrote a diary for the BBC blog,
p246
aVshe volunteered herself
p247
aVfor the New York Times documentaries,
p248
aVand she spoke from every platform she could.
p249
aVAnd her voice was the most powerful voice.
p250
aVIt spread like a crescendo all around the world.
p251
aVAnd that was the reason the Taliban
p252
aVcould not tolerate her campaign,
p253
aVand on October 9 2012,
p254
aVshe was shot in the head at point blank range.
p255
aa(lp256
VIt was a doomsday for my family and for me.
p257
aVThe world turned into a big black hole.
p258
aVWhile my daughter was
p259
aVon the verge of life and death,
p260
aVI whispered into the ears of my wife,
p261
aV"Should I be blamed for what happened
p262
aVto my daughter and your daughter?"
p263
aa(lp264
VAnd she abruptly told me,
p265
aV"Please don't blame yourself.
p266
aVYou stood for the right cause.
p267
aVYou put your life at stake
p268
aVfor the cause of truth,
p269
aVfor the cause of peace,
p270
aVand for the cause of education,
p271
aVand your daughter in inspired from you
p272
aVand she joined you.
p273
aVYou both were on the right path
p274
aVand God will protect her."
p275
aa(lp276
VThese few words meant a lot to me,
p277
aVand I didn't ask this question again.
p278
aa(lp279
VWhen Malala was in the hospital,
p280
aVand she was going through the severe pains
p281
aVand she had had severe headaches
p282
aVbecause her facial nerve was cut down,
p283
aVI used to see a dark shadow
p284
aVspreading on the face of my wife.
p285
aVBut my daughter never complained.
p286
aVShe used to tell us,
p287
aV"I'm fine with my crooked smile
p288
aVand with my numbness in my face.
p289
aVI'll be okay. Please don't worry."
p290
aVShe was a solace for us,
p291
aVand she consoled us.
p292
aa(lp293
VDear brothers and sisters,
p294
aVwe learned from her how to be resilient
p295
aVin the most difficult times,
p296
aVand I'm glad to share with you
p297
aVthat despite being an icon
p298
aVfor the rights of children and women,
p299
aVshe is like any 16-year old girl.
p300
aVShe cries when her homework is incomplete.
p301
aVShe quarrels with her brothers,
p302
aVand I am very happy for that.
p303
aa(lp304
VPeople ask me,
p305
aVwhat special is in my mentorship
p306
aVwhich has made Malala so bold
p307
aVand so courageous and so vocal and poised?
p308
aVI tell them, don't ask me what I did.
p309
aVAsk me what I did not do.
p310
aVI did not clip her wings, and that's all.
p311
aa(lp312
VThank you very much.
p313
aa(lp314
V(Applause)
p315
aVThank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause)
