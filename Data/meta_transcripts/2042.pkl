VCould I protect my father
p4
aVfrom the Armed Islamic Group with a paring knife?
p5
aVThat was the question I faced
p6
aVone Tuesday morning in June of 1993,
p7
aVwhen I was a law student.
p8
aa(lp9
VI woke up early that morning
p10
aVin Dad's apartment
p11
aVon the outskirts of Algiers, Algeria,
p12
aVto an unrelenting pounding on the front door.
p13
aVIt was a season as described by a local paper
p14
aVwhen every Tuesday a scholar fell
p15
aVto the bullets of fundamentalist assassins.
p16
aVMy father's university teaching of Darwin
p17
aVhad already provoked a classroom visit
p18
aVfrom the head of the so-called Islamic Salvation Front,
p19
aVwho denounced Dad as an advocate of biologism
p20
aVbefore Dad had ejected the man,
p21
aVand now whoever was outside
p22
aVwould neither identify himself nor go away.
p23
aVSo my father tried to get the police on the phone,
p24
aVbut perhaps terrified by the rising tide
p25
aVof armed extremism that had already claimed
p26
aVthe lives of so many Algerian officers,
p27
aVthey didn't even answer.
p28
aVAnd that was when I went to the kitchen,
p29
aVgot out a paring knife,
p30
aVand took up a position inside the entryway.
p31
aVIt was a ridiculous thing to do, really,
p32
aVbut I couldn't think of anything else,
p33
aVand so there I stood.
p34
aa(lp35
VWhen I look back now, I think that that was the moment
p36
aVthat set me on the path was to writing a book
p37
aVcalled "Your Fatwa Does Not Apply Here:
p38
aVUntold Stories from the Fight Against Muslim Fundamentalism."
p39
aVThe title comes from a Pakistani play.
p40
aVI think it was actually that moment
p41
aVthat sent me on the journey
p42
aVto interview 300 people of Muslim heritage
p43
aVfrom nearly 30 countries,
p44
aVfrom Afghanistan to Mali,
p45
aVto find out how they fought fundamentalism
p46
aVpeacefully like my father did,
p47
aVand how they coped with the attendant risks.
p48
aa(lp49
VLuckily, back in June of 1993,
p50
aVour unidentified visitor went away,
p51
aVbut other families were so much less lucky,
p52
aVand that was the thought that motivated my research.
p53
aVIn any case, someone would return
p54
aVa few months later and leave a note
p55
aVon Dad's kitchen table,
p56
aVwhich simply said, "Consider yourself dead."
p57
aVSubsequently, Algeria's fundamentalist armed groups
p58
aVwould murder as many as 200,000 civilians
p59
aVin what came to be known
p60
aVas the dark decade of the 1990s,
p61
aVincluding every single one
p62
aVof the women that you see here.
p63
aVIn its harsh counterterrorist response,
p64
aVthe state resorted to torture
p65
aVand to forced disappearances,
p66
aVand as terrible as all of these events became,
p67
aVthe international community largely ignored them.
p68
aVFinally, my father, an Algerian peasant's son turned professor,
p69
aVwas forced to stop teaching at the university
p70
aVand to flee his apartment,
p71
aVbut what I will never forget
p72
aVabout Mahfoud Bennoune, my dad,
p73
aVwas that like so many other Algerian intellectuals,
p74
aVhe refused to leave the country
p75
aVand he continued to publish pointed criticisms,
p76
aVboth of the fundamentalists
p77
aVand sometimes of the government they battled.
p78
aVFor example, in a November 1994 series
p79
aVin the newspaper El Watan
p80
aVentitled "How Fundamentalism
p81
aVProduced a Terrorism without Precedent,"
p82
aVhe denounced what he called
p83
aVthe terrorists' radical break with the true Islam
p84
aVas it was lived by our ancestors.
p85
aVThese were words that could get you killed.
p86
aa(lp87
VMy father's country taught me
p88
aVin that dark decade of the 1990s that
p89
aVthe popular struggle against Muslim fundamentalism
p90
aVis one of the most important
p91
aVand overlooked human rights struggles
p92
aVin the world.
p93
aVThis remains true today, nearly 20 years later.
p94
aVYou see, in every country
p95
aVwhere you hear about armed jihadis
p96
aVtargeting civilians,
p97
aVthere are also unarmed people
p98
aVdefying those militants that you don't hear about,
p99
aVand those people need our support to succeed.
p100
aa(lp101
VIn the West, it's often assumed
p102
aVthat Muslims generally condone terrorism.
p103
aVSome on the right think this because they view
p104
aVMuslim culture as inherently violent,
p105
aVand some on the left imagine this
p106
aVbecause they view Muslim violence,
p107
aVfundamentalist violence,
p108
aVsolely as a product of legitimate grievances.
p109
aVBut both views are dead wrong.
p110
aVIn fact, many people of Muslim heritage
p111
aVaround the world are staunch opponents
p112
aVboth of fundamentalism and of terrorism,
p113
aVand often for very good reason.
p114
aVYou see, they're much more likely to be victims
p115
aVof this violence than its perpetrators.
p116
aVLet me just give you one example.
p117
aVAccording to a 2009 survey
p118
aVof Arabic language media resources,
p119
aVbetween 2004 and 2008,
p120
aVno more than 15 percent of al Qaeda's victims
p121
aVwere Westerners.
p122
aVThat's a terrible toll, but the vast majority
p123
aVwere people of Muslim heritage,
p124
aVkilled by Muslim fundamentalists.
p125
aa(lp126
VNow I've been talking for the last five minutes
p127
aVabout fundamentalism, and you have a right to know
p128
aVexactly what I mean.
p129
aVI cite the definition given by the Algerian sociologist
p130
aVMarieme Helie Lucas,
p131
aVand she says that fundamentalisms,
p132
aVnote the "s," so within all of the world's
p133
aVgreat religious traditions,
p134
aV"fundamentalisms are political movements of the extreme right
p135
aVwhich in a context of globalization
p136
aVmanipulate religion in order to achieve
p137
aVtheir political aims."
p138
aVSadia Abbas has called this the radical politicization
p139
aVof theology.
p140
aVNow I want to avoid projecting the notion
p141
aVthat there's sort of a monolith out there
p142
aVcalled Muslim fundamentalism that is the same everywhere,
p143
aVbecause these movements also have their diversities.
p144
aVSome use and advocate violence.
p145
aVSome do not, though they're often interrelated.
p146
aVThey take different forms.
p147
aVSome may be non-governmental organizations,
p148
aVeven here in Britain like Cageprisoners.
p149
aVSome may become political parties,
p150
aVlike the Muslim Brotherhood,
p151
aVand some may be openly armed groups
p152
aVlike the Taliban.
p153
aVBut in any case, these are all radical projects.
p154
aVThey're not conservative or traditional approaches.
p155
aVThey're most often about changing people's relationship with Islam
p156
aVrather than preserving it.
p157
aVWhat I am talking about is the Muslim extreme right,
p158
aVand the fact that its adherents are
p159
aVor purport to be Muslim
p160
aVmakes them no less offensive
p161
aVthan the extreme right anywhere else.
p162
aVSo in my view, if we consider ourselves
p163
aVliberal or left-wing,
p164
aVhuman rights-loving or feminist,
p165
aVwe must oppose these movements
p166
aVand support their grassroots opponents.
p167
aVNow let me be clear
p168
aVthat I support an effective struggle
p169
aVagainst fundamentalism,
p170
aVbut also a struggle that must itself
p171
aVrespect international law,
p172
aVso nothing I am saying should be taken
p173
aVas a justification for refusals
p174
aVto democratize,
p175
aVand here I send out a shout-out of support
p176
aVto the pro-democracy movement  in Algeria today, Barakat.
p177
aVNor should anything I say be taken
p178
aVas a justification of violations of human rights,
p179
aVlike the mass death sentences
p180
aVhanded out in Egypt earlier this week.
p181
aVBut what I am saying
p182
aVis that we must challenge these Muslim fundamentalist movements
p183
aVbecause they threaten human rights
p184
aVacross Muslim-majority contexts,
p185
aVand they do this in a range of ways,
p186
aVmost obviously with the direct attacks on civilians
p187
aVby the armed groups that carry those out.
p188
aVBut that violence is just the tip of the iceberg.
p189
aVThese movements as a whole purvey discrimination
p190
aVagainst religious minorities and sexual minorities.
p191
aVThey seek to curtail the freedom of religion
p192
aVof everyone who either practices in a different way
p193
aVor chooses not to practice.
p194
aVAnd most definingly, they lead an all-out war
p195
aVon the rights of women.
p196
aa(lp197
VNow, faced with these movements
p198
aVin recent years, Western discourse
p199
aVhas most often offered
p200
aVtwo flawed responses.
p201
aVThe first that one sometimes finds on the right
p202
aVsuggests that most Muslims are fundamentalist
p203
aVor something about Islam is inherently fundamentalist,
p204
aVand this is just offensive and wrong,
p205
aVbut unfortunately on the left one sometimes encounters
p206
aVa discourse that is too politically correct
p207
aVto acknowledge the problem of Muslim fundamentalism at all
p208
aVor, even worse, apologizes for it,
p209
aVand this is unacceptable as well.
p210
aVSo what I'm seeking is a new way
p211
aVof talking about this all together,
p212
aVwhich is grounded in the lived experiences
p213
aVand the hope of the people on the front lines.
p214
aVI'm painfully aware that there has been
p215
aVan increase in discrimination against Muslims in recent years
p216
aVin countries like the U.K. and the U.S.,
p217
aVand that too is a matter of grave concern,
p218
aVbut I firmly believe
p219
aVthat telling these counter-stereotypical stories
p220
aVof people of Muslim heritage
p221
aVwho have confronted the fundamentalists
p222
aVand been their primary victims
p223
aVis also a great way of countering that discrimination.
p224
aVSo now let me introduce you
p225
aVto four people whose stories
p226
aVI had the great honor of telling.
p227
aa(lp228
VFaizan Peerzada and the Rafi Peer Theatre
p229
aVworkshop named for his father
p230
aVhave for years promoted the performing arts
p231
aVin Pakistan.
p232
aVWith the rise of jihadist violence,
p233
aVthey began to receive threats
p234
aVto call off their events, which they refused to heed.
p235
aVAnd so a bomber struck their 2008
p236
aVeighth world performing arts festival in Lahore,
p237
aVproducing rain of glass
p238
aVthat fell into the venue
p239
aVinjuring nine people,
p240
aVand later that same night,
p241
aVthe Peerzadas made a very difficult decision:
p242
aVthey announced that their festival
p243
aVwould continue as planned the next day.
p244
aVAs Faizan said at the time,
p245
aVif we bow down to the Islamists,
p246
aVwe'll just be sitting in a dark corner.
p247
aVBut they didn't know what would happen.
p248
aVWould anyone come?
p249
aVIn fact, thousands of people came out the next day
p250
aVto support the performing arts in Lahore,
p251
aVand this simultaneously thrilled
p252
aVand terrified Faizan,
p253
aVand he ran up to a woman
p254
aVwho had come in with her two small children,
p255
aVand he said, "You do know there was a bomb here yesterday,
p256
aVand you do know there's a threat here today."
p257
aVAnd she said, "I know that,
p258
aVbut I came to your festival
p259
aVwith my mother when I was their age,
p260
aVand I still have those images in my mind.
p261
aVWe have to be here."
p262
aVWith stalwart audiences like this,
p263
aVthe Peerzadas were able to conclude
p264
aVtheir festival on schedule.
p265
aa(lp266
VAnd then the next year,
p267
aVthey lost all of their sponsors
p268
aVdue to the security risk.
p269
aVSo when I met them in 2010,
p270
aVthey were in the middle of the first subsequent event
p271
aVthat they were able to have in the same venue,
p272
aVand this was the ninth youth performing arts festival
p273
aVheld in Lahore in a year when that city
p274
aVhad already experienced 44 terror attacks.
p275
aVThis was a time when the Pakistani Taliban
p276
aVhad commenced their systematic targeting
p277
aVof girls' schools that would culminate
p278
aVin the attack on Malala Yousafzai.
p279
aVWhat did the Peerzadas do in that environment?
p280
aVThey staged girls' school theater.
p281
aVSo I had the privilege of watching "Naang Wal,"
p282
aVwhich was a musical in the Punjabi language,
p283
aVand the girls of Lahore Grammar School
p284
aVplayed all the parts.
p285
aVThey sang and danced,
p286
aVthey played the mice and the water buffalo,
p287
aVand I held my breath, wondering,
p288
aVwould we get to the end
p289
aVof this amazing show?
p290
aVAnd when we did, the whole audience
p291
aVcollectively exhaled,
p292
aVand a few people actually wept,
p293
aVand then they filled the auditorium
p294
aVwith the peaceful boom of their applause.
p295
aVAnd I remember thinking in that moment
p296
aVthat the bombers made headlines here
p297
aVtwo years before
p298
aVbut this night and these people
p299
aVare as important a story.
p300
aa(lp301
VMaria Bashir is the first and only
p302
aVwoman chief prosecutor in Afghanistan.
p303
aVShe's been in the post since 2008
p304
aVand actually opened an office to investigate
p305
aVcases of violence against women,
p306
aVwhich she says is the most important area
p307
aVin her mandate.
p308
aVWhen I meet her in her office in Herat,
p309
aVshe enters surrounded by
p310
aVfour large men with four huge guns.
p311
aVIn fact, she now has 23 bodyguards,
p312
aVbecause she has weathered bomb attacks
p313
aVthat nearly killed her kids,
p314
aVand it took the leg off of one of her guards.
p315
aa(lp316
VWhy does she continue?
p317
aVShe says with a smile that that is the question
p318
aVthat everyone asks\u2014
p319
aVas she puts it, "Why you risk not living?"
p320
aVAnd it is simply that for her,
p321
aVa better future for all the Maria Bashirs to come
p322
aVis worth the risk,
p323
aVand she knows that if people like her
p324
aVdo not take the risk,
p325
aVthere will be no better future.
p326
aVLater on in our interview,
p327
aVProsecutor Bashir tells me how worried she is
p328
aVabout the possible outcome
p329
aVof government negotiations with the Taliban,
p330
aVthe people who have been trying to kill her.
p331
aV"If we give them a place in the government,"
p332
aVshe asks, "Who will protect women's rights?"
p333
aVAnd she urges the international community
p334
aVnot to forget its promise about women
p335
aVbecause now they want peace with Taliban.
p336
aVA few weeks after I leave Afghanistan,
p337
aVI see a headline on the Internet.
p338
aVAn Afghan prosecutor has been assassinated.
p339
aVI google desperately,
p340
aVand thankfully that day I find out
p341
aVthat Maria was not the victim,
p342
aVthough sadly, another Afghan prosecutor
p343
aVwas gunned down on his way to work.
p344
aVAnd when I hear headlines like that now,
p345
aVI think that as international troops
p346
aVleave Afghanistan this year and beyond,
p347
aVwe must continue to care
p348
aVabout what happens to people there,
p349
aVto all of the Maria Bashirs.
p350
aVSometimes I still hear her voice in my head
p351
aVsaying, with no bravado whatsoever,
p352
aV"The situation of the women of Afghanistan
p353
aVwill be better someday.
p354
aVWe should prepare the ground for this,
p355
aVeven if we are killed."
p356
aa(lp357
VThere are no words adequate
p358
aVto denounce the al Shabaab terrorists
p359
aVwho attacked the Westgate Mall in Nairobi
p360
aVon the same day as a children's cooking competition
p361
aVin September of 2013.
p362
aVThey killed 67, including poets and pregnant women.
p363
aVFar away in the American Midwest,
p364
aVI had the good fortune of meeting Somali-Americans
p365
aVwho were working to counter the efforts of al Shabaab
p366
aVto recruit a small number of young people
p367
aVfrom their city of Minneapolis
p368
aVto take part in atrocities like Westgate.
p369
aVAbdirizak Bihi's studious
p370
aV17-year-old nephew Burhan Hassan
p371
aVwas recruited here in 2008,
p372
aVspirited to Somalia,
p373
aVand then killed when he tried to come home.
p374
aVSince that time, Mr. Bihi,
p375
aVwho directs the no-budget Somali Education and Advocacy Center,
p376
aVhas been vocally denouncing the recruitment
p377
aVand the failures of government
p378
aVand Somali-American institutions
p379
aVlike the Abubakar As-Saddique Islamic Center
p380
aVwhere he believes his nephew was radicalized
p381
aVduring a youth program.
p382
aVBut he doesn't just criticize the mosque.
p383
aVHe also takes on the government
p384
aVfor its failure to do more
p385
aVto prevent poverty in his community.
p386
aVGiven his own lack of financial resources,
p387
aVMr. Bihi has had to be creative.
p388
aVTo counter the efforts of al Shabaab
p389
aVto sway more disaffected youth,
p390
aVin the wake of the group's 2010 attack
p391
aVon World Cup viewers in Uganda,
p392
aVhe organized a Ramadan basketball tournament
p393
aVin Minneapolis in response.
p394
aVScores of Somali-American kids came out
p395
aVto embrace sport
p396
aVdespite the fatwa against it.
p397
aVThey played basketball
p398
aVas Burhan Hassan never would again.
p399
aVFor his efforts, Mr. Bihi has been ostracized
p400
aVby the leadership of the Abubakar As-Saddique Islamic Center,
p401
aVwith which he used to have good relations.
p402
aVHe told me, "One day we saw the imam on TV
p403
aVcalling us infidels and saying,
p404
aV'These families are trying to destroy the mosque.'"
p405
aVThis is at complete odds
p406
aVwith how Abdirizak Bihi understands
p407
aVwhat he is trying to do
p408
aVby exposing al Shabaab recruitment,
p409
aVwhich is to save the religion I love
p410
aVfrom a small number of extremists.
p411
aa(lp412
VNow I want to tell one last story,
p413
aVthat of a 22-year-old law student in Algeria
p414
aVnamed Amel Zenoune-Zouani
p415
aVwho had the same dreams of a legal career
p416
aVthat I did back in the '90s.
p417
aVShe refused to give up her studies,
p418
aVdespite the fact that the fundamentalists
p419
aVbattling the Algerian state back then
p420
aVthreatened all who continued their education.
p421
aVOn January 26, 1997, Amel boarded the bus
p422
aVin Algiers where she was studying
p423
aVto go home and spend a Ramadan evening
p424
aVwith her family,
p425
aVand would never finish law school.
p426
aVWhen the bus reached the outskirts
p427
aVof her hometown, it was stopped
p428
aVat a checkpoint manned by men
p429
aVfrom the Armed Islamic Group.
p430
aVCarrying her schoolbag,
p431
aVAmel was taken off the bus
p432
aVand killed in the street.
p433
aVThe men who cut her throat
p434
aVthen told everyone else,
p435
aV"If you go to university,
p436
aVthe day will come when we will kill all of you
p437
aVjust like this."
p438
aa(lp439
VAmel died at exactly 5:17 p.m.,
p440
aVwhich we know because when she fell in the street,
p441
aVher watch broke.
p442
aVHer mother showed me the watch
p443
aVwith the second hand still aimed
p444
aVoptimistically upward
p445
aVtowards a 5:18 that would never come.
p446
aVShortly before her death,
p447
aVAmel had said to her mother of herself
p448
aVand her sisters,
p449
aV"Nothing will happen to us, Inshallah, God willing,
p450
aVbut if something happens,
p451
aVyou must know that we are dead for knowledge.
p452
aVYou and father must keep your heads held high."
p453
aa(lp454
VThe loss of such a young woman is unfathomable,
p455
aVand so as I did my research
p456
aVI found myself searching for Amel's hope again
p457
aVand her name even means "hope" in Arabic.
p458
aVI think I found it in two places.
p459
aVThe first is in the strength of her family
p460
aVand all the other families to continue telling their stories
p461
aVand to go on with their lives despite the terrorism.
p462
aVIn fact, Amel's sister Lamia overcame her grief,
p463
aVwent to law school,
p464
aVand practices as a lawyer in Algiers today,
p465
aVsomething which is only possible
p466
aVbecause the armed fundamentalists
p467
aVwere largely defeated in the country.
p468
aVAnd the second place I found Amel's hope
p469
aVwas everywhere that women and men
p470
aVcontinue to defy the jihadis.
p471
aVWe must support all of those in honor of Amel
p472
aVwho continue this human rights struggle today,
p473
aVlike the Network of Women Living Under Muslim Laws.
p474
aVIt is not enough, as the victims rights advocate
p475
aVCherifa Kheddar told me in Algiers,
p476
aVit is not enough just to battle terrorism.
p477
aVWe must also challenge fundamentalism,
p478
aVbecause fundamentalism is the ideology
p479
aVthat makes the bed of this terrorism.
