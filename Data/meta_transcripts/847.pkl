VSo here it is. You can check: I am short, I'm French,
p4
aVI have a pretty strong French accent,
p5
aVso that's going to be clear in a moment.
p6
aa(lp7
VMaybe a sobering thought
p8
aVand something you all know about.
p9
aVAnd I suspect many of you gave
p10
aVsomething to the people of Haiti this year.
p11
aVAnd there is something else
p12
aVI believe in the back of your mind
p13
aVyou also know.
p14
aVThat is, every day,
p15
aV25,000 children die
p16
aVof entirely preventable causes.
p17
aVThat's a Haiti earthquake every eight days.
p18
aVAnd I suspect many of you probably gave something
p19
aVtowards that problem as well,
p20
aVbut somehow it doesn't happen
p21
aVwith the same intensity.
p22
aa(lp23
VSo why is that?
p24
aVWell, here is a thought experiment for you.
p25
aVImagine you have a few million dollars that you've raised \u2014
p26
aVmaybe you're a politician in a developing country
p27
aVand you have a budget to spend. You want to spend it on the poor:
p28
aVHow do you go about it?
p29
aVDo you believe the people who tell you
p30
aVthat all we need to do is to spend money?
p31
aVThat we know how to eradicate poverty,
p32
aVwe just need to do more?
p33
aVOr do you believe the people who tell you that
p34
aVaid is not going to help, on the contrary it might hurt,
p35
aVit might exacerbate corruption, dependence, etc.?
p36
aVOr maybe you turn to the past.
p37
aVAfter all, we have spent billions of dollars on aid.
p38
aVMaybe you look at the past and see.
p39
aVHas it done any good?
p40
aa(lp41
VAnd, sadly, we don't know.
p42
aVAnd worst of all, we will never know.
p43
aVAnd the reason is that \u2014 take Africa for example.
p44
aVAfricans have already got a lot of aid.
p45
aVThese are the blue bars.
p46
aVAnd the GDP in Africa is not making much progress.
p47
aVOkay, fine. How do you know what
p48
aVwould have happened without the aid?
p49
aVMaybe it would have been much worse,
p50
aVor maybe it would have been better.
p51
aVWe have no idea. We don't know what the counterfactual is.
p52
aVThere's only one Africa.
p53
aa(lp54
VSo what do you do?
p55
aVTo give the aid, and hope and pray that something comes out of it?
p56
aVOr do you focus on your everyday life
p57
aVand let the earthquake every eight days
p58
aVcontinue to happen?
p59
aVThe thing is, if we don't know
p60
aVwhether we are doing any good,
p61
aVwe are not any better
p62
aVthan the Medieval doctors and their leeches.
p63
aVSometimes the patient gets better, sometimes the patient dies.
p64
aVIs it the leeches? Is it something else?
p65
aVWe don't know.
p66
aa(lp67
VSo here are some other questions.
p68
aVThey're smaller questions,
p69
aVbut they are not that small.
p70
aVImmunization, that's the cheapest way
p71
aVto save a child's life.
p72
aVAnd the world has spent a lot of money on it:
p73
aVThe GAVI and the Gates Foundations
p74
aVare each pledging a lot of money towards it,
p75
aVand developing countries themselves have been doing a lot of effort.
p76
aVAnd yet, every year
p77
aVat least 25 million children
p78
aVdo not get the immunization they should get.
p79
aVSo this is what you call a "last mile problem."
p80
aVThe technology is there,
p81
aVthe infrastructure is there,
p82
aVand yet it doesn't happen.
p83
aVSo you have your million.
p84
aVHow do you use your million
p85
aVto solve this last mile problem?
p86
aa(lp87
VAnd here's another question:
p88
aVMalaria. Malaria kills almost
p89
aV900,000 people every year,
p90
aVmost of them in Sub-Saharan Africa,
p91
aVmost of them under five.
p92
aVIn fact, that is the leading cause of under-five mortality.
p93
aVWe already know how to kill malaria,
p94
aVbut some people come to you and say,
p95
aV"You have your millions. How about bed nets?"
p96
aVBed nets are very cheap.
p97
aVFor 10 dollars, you can manufacture and ship
p98
aVan insecticide treated bed net
p99
aVand you can teach someone to use them.
p100
aVAnd, not only do they protect the people who sleep under them,
p101
aVbut they have these great contagion benefits.
p102
aVIf half of a community sleeps under a net,
p103
aVthe other half also benefits
p104
aVbecause the contagion of the disease spread.
p105
aVAnd yet, only a quarter of kids at risk sleep under a net.
p106
aVSocieties should be willing to go out
p107
aVand subsidize the net, give them for free,
p108
aVor, for that matter, pay people to use them
p109
aVbecause of those contagion benefits.
p110
aV"Not so fast," say other people.
p111
aV"If you give the nets for free,
p112
aVpeople are not going to value them.
p113
aVThey're not going to use them,
p114
aVor at least they're not going to use them as bed nets,
p115
aVmaybe as fishing nets."
p116
aVSo, what do you do?
p117
aVDo you give the nets for free to maximize coverage,
p118
aVor do you make people pay
p119
aVin order to make sure that they really value them?
p120
aVHow do you know?
p121
aa(lp122
VAnd a third question: Education.
p123
aVMaybe that's the solution, maybe we should send kids to school.
p124
aVBut how do you do that?
p125
aVDo you hire teachers? Do you build more schools?
p126
aVDo you provide school lunch?
p127
aVHow do you know?
p128
aa(lp129
VSo here is the thing.
p130
aVI cannot answer the big question,
p131
aVwhether aid did any good or not.
p132
aVBut these three questions, I can answer them.
p133
aVIt's not the Middle Ages anymore,
p134
aVit's the 21st century.
p135
aVAnd in the 20th century,
p136
aVrandomized, controlled trials
p137
aVhave revolutionized medicine
p138
aVby allowing us to distinguish
p139
aVbetween drugs that work
p140
aVand drugs that don't work.
p141
aVAnd you can do the same
p142
aVrandomized, controlled trial for social policy.
p143
aVYou can put social innovation to the same
p144
aVrigorous, scientific tests
p145
aVthat we use for drugs.
p146
aVAnd in this way, you can take the guesswork
p147
aVout of policy-making
p148
aVby knowing what works,
p149
aVwhat doesn't work and why.
p150
aVAnd I'll give you some examples with those three questions.
p151
aa(lp152
VSo I start with immunization.
p153
aVHere's Udaipur District, Rajasthan. Beautiful.
p154
aVWell, when I started working there,
p155
aVabout one percent of children
p156
aVwere fully immunized.
p157
aVThat's bad, but there are places like that.
p158
aVNow, it's not because the vaccines are not there \u2014
p159
aVthey are there and they are free \u2014
p160
aVand it's not because parents do not care about their kids.
p161
aVThe same child that is not immunized against measles,
p162
aVif they do get measles, parents will spend
p163
aVthousands of rupees to help them.
p164
aVSo you get these empty village subcenters
p165
aVand crowded hospitals.
p166
aVSo what is the problem?
p167
aVWell, part of the problem, surely, is people do not fully understand.
p168
aVAfter all, in this country as well,
p169
aVall sorts of myths and misconceptions
p170
aVgo around immunization.
p171
aVSo if that's the case, that's difficult,
p172
aVbecause persuasion is really difficult.
p173
aVBut maybe there is another problem as well.
p174
aVIt's going from intention to action.
p175
aVImagine you are a mother
p176
aVin Udaipur District, Rajasthan.
p177
aVYou have to walk a few kilometers to get your kids immunized.
p178
aVAnd maybe when you get there, what you find is this:
p179
aVThe subcenter is closed. Ao you have to come back,
p180
aVand you are so busy and you have so many other things to do,
p181
aVyou will always tend to postpone and postpone,
p182
aVand eventually it gets too late.
p183
aVWell, if that's the problem, then that's much easier.
p184
aVBecause A, we can make it easy,
p185
aVand B, we can maybe
p186
aVgive people a reason to act today,
p187
aVrather than wait till tomorrow.
p188
aa(lp189
VSo these are simple ideas, but we didn't know.
p190
aVSo let's try them.
p191
aVSo what we did is we did a randomized, controlled trial
p192
aVin 134 villages in Udaipur Districts.
p193
aVSo the blue dots
p194
aVare selected randomly.
p195
aVWe made it easy \u2014 I'll tell you how in a moment.
p196
aVIn the red dots, we made it easy
p197
aVand gave people a reason to act now.
p198
aVThe white dots are comparisons, nothing changed.
p199
aVSo we make it easy by organizing
p200
aVthis monthly camp where people can
p201
aVget their kids immunized.
p202
aVAnd then you make it easy
p203
aVand give a reason to act now
p204
aVby adding a kilo of lentils for each immunization.
p205
aVNow, a kilo of lentils is tiny.
p206
aVIt's never going to convince anybody
p207
aVto do something that they don't want to do.
p208
aVOn the other hand, if your problem is you tend to postpone,
p209
aVthen it might give you a reason to act today
p210
aVrather than later.
p211
aa(lp212
VSo what do we find?
p213
aVWell, beforehand, everything is the same.
p214
aVThat's the beauty of randomization.
p215
aVAfterwards,
p216
aVthe camp \u2014 just having the camp \u2014
p217
aVincreases immunization from six percent to 17 percent.
p218
aVThat's full immunization.
p219
aVThat's not bad, that's a good improvement.
p220
aVAdd the lentils and you reach to 38 percent.
p221
aVSo here you've got your answer.
p222
aVMake it easy and give a kilo of lentils,
p223
aVyou multiply immunization rate by six.
p224
aVNow, you might say, "Well, but it's not sustainable.
p225
aVWe cannot keep giving lentils to people."
p226
aVWell, it turns out it's wrong economics,
p227
aVbecause it is cheaper
p228
aVto give lentils than not to give them.
p229
aVSince you have to pay for the nurse anyway,
p230
aVthe cost per immunization
p231
aVends up being cheaper if you give incentives than if you don't.
p232
aa(lp233
VHow about bed nets?
p234
aVShould you give them for free, or should you ask people to pay for them?
p235
aVSo the answer hinges
p236
aVon the answer to three simple questions.
p237
aVOne is: If people must pay for a bed net,
p238
aVare they going to purchase them?
p239
aVThe second one is:
p240
aVIf I give bed nets for free,
p241
aVare people going to use them?
p242
aVAnd the third one is:
p243
aVDo free bed nets discourage future purchase?
p244
aVThe third one is important
p245
aVbecause if we think people get used to handouts,
p246
aVit might destroy markets to distribute free bed nets.
p247
aVNow this is a debate that has generated
p248
aVa lot of emotion and angry rhetoric.
p249
aVIt's more ideological than practical,
p250
aVbut it turns out it's an easy question.
p251
aVWe can know the answer to this question.
p252
aVWe can just run an experiment.
p253
aVAnd many experiments have been run, and they all have the same results,
p254
aVso I'm just going to talk to you about one.
p255
aa(lp256
VAnd this one that was in Kenya,
p257
aVthey went around and distributed to people
p258
aVvouchers, discount vouchers.
p259
aVSo people with their voucher
p260
aVcould get the bed net in the local pharmacy.
p261
aVAnd some people get 100 percent discount,
p262
aVand some people get 20 percent discounts,
p263
aVand some people get 50 percent discount, etc.
p264
aVAnd now we can see what happens.
p265
aVSo, how about the purchasing?
p266
aVWell, what you can see is that
p267
aVwhen people have to pay for their bed nets,
p268
aVthe coverage rate really falls down a lot.
p269
aVSo even with partial subsidy,
p270
aVthree dollars is still not the full cost of a bed net,
p271
aVand now you only have 20 percent of the people with the bed nets,
p272
aVyou lose the health immunity, that's not great.
p273
aVSecond thing is, how about the use?
p274
aVWell, the good news is, people, if they have the bed nets,
p275
aVwill use the bed nets regardless of how they got it.
p276
aVIf they get it for free, they use it.
p277
aVIf they have to pay for it, they use it.
p278
aVHow about the long term?
p279
aVIn the long term,
p280
aVpeople who got the free bed nets,
p281
aVone year later, were offered the option
p282
aVto purchase a bed net at two dollars.
p283
aVAnd people who got the free one
p284
aVwere actually more likely to purchase the second one
p285
aVthan people who didn't get a free one.
p286
aVSo people do not get used to handouts; they get used to nets.
p287
aVMaybe we need to give them a little bit more credit.
p288
aa(lp289
VSo, that's for bed nets. So you will think, "That's great.
p290
aVYou know how to immunize kids, you know how to give bed nets."
p291
aVBut what politicians need is a range of options.
p292
aVThey need to know: Out of all the things I could do,
p293
aVwhat is the best way to achieve my goals?
p294
aVSo suppose your goal is to get kids into school.
p295
aVThere are so many things you could do. You could pay for uniforms,
p296
aVyou could eliminate fees, you could build latrines,
p297
aVyou could give girls sanitary pads, etc., etc.
p298
aVSo what's the best?
p299
aVWell, at some level, we think
p300
aVall of these things should work.
p301
aVSo, is that sufficient? If we think they should work intuitively,
p302
aVshould we go for them?
p303
aVWell, in business, that's certainly not the way we would go about it.
p304
aa(lp305
VConsider for example
p306
aVtransporting goods.
p307
aVBefore the canals were invented
p308
aVin Britain before the Industrial Revolution,
p309
aVgoods used to go on horse carts.
p310
aVAnd then canals were built,
p311
aVand with the same horseman and the same horse,
p312
aVyou could carry ten times as much cargo.
p313
aVSo should they have continued
p314
aVto carry the goods on the horse carts, on the ground,
p315
aVthat they would eventually get there?
p316
aVWell, if that had been the case,
p317
aVthere would have been no Industrial Revolution.
p318
aVSo why shouldn't we do the same with social policy?
p319
aVIn technology, we spend so much time
p320
aVexperimenting, fine-tuning,
p321
aVgetting the absolute cheapest way to do something,
p322
aVso why aren't we doing that with social policy?
p323
aa(lp324
VWell, with experiments, what you can do
p325
aVis answer a simple question.
p326
aVSuppose you have 100 dollars to spend
p327
aVon various interventions.
p328
aVHow many extra years of education
p329
aVdo you get for your hundred dollars?
p330
aVNow I'm going to show you
p331
aVwhat we get with various education interventions.
p332
aVSo the first ones are if you want the usual suspects,
p333
aVhire teachers, school meals,
p334
aVschool uniforms, scholarships.
p335
aVAnd that's not bad. For your hundred dollars,
p336
aVyou get between one and three extra years of education.
p337
aVThings that don't work so well is bribing parents,
p338
aVjust because so many kids are already going to school
p339
aVthat you end up spending a lot of money.
p340
aVAnd here are the most surprising results.
p341
aVTell people the benefits of education,
p342
aVthat's very cheap to do.
p343
aVSo for every hundred dollars you spend doing that,
p344
aVyou get 40 extra years of education.
p345
aVAnd, in places where there are worms,
p346
aVintestinal worms,
p347
aVcure the kids of their worms.
p348
aVAnd for every hundred dollars,
p349
aVyou get almost 30 extra years of education.
p350
aVSo this is not your intuition,
p351
aVthis is not what people would have gone for,
p352
aVand yet, these are the programs that work.
p353
aVWe need that kind of information, we need more of it,
p354
aVand then we need to guide policy.
p355
aa(lp356
VSo now, I started from the big problem, and I couldn't answer it.
p357
aVAnd I cut it into smaller questions,
p358
aVand I have the answer to these smaller questions.
p359
aVAnd they are good, scientific, robust answers.
p360
aa(lp361
VSo let's go back to Haiti for a moment.
p362
aVIn Haiti, about 200,000 people died \u2014
p363
aVactually, a bit more by the latest estimate.
p364
aVAnd the response of the world was great:
p365
aVTwo billion dollars got pledged just last month,
p366
aVso that's about 10,000 dollars per death.
p367
aVThat doesn't sound like that much when you think about it.
p368
aVBut if we were willing to spend 10,000 dollars
p369
aVfor every child under five who dies,
p370
aVthat would be 90 billion per year
p371
aVjust for that problem.
p372
aVAnd yet it doesn't happen.
p373
aVSo, why is that?
p374
aVWell, I think what part of the problem is that,
p375
aVin Haiti, although the problem is huge,
p376
aVsomehow we understand it, it's localized.
p377
aVYou give your money to Doctors Without Borders,
p378
aVyou give your money to Partners In Health,
p379
aVand they'll send in the doctors, and they'll send in the lumber,
p380
aVand they'll helicopter things out and in.
p381
aVAnd the problem of poverty is not like that.
p382
aVSo, first, it's mostly invisible;
p383
aVsecond, it's huge;
p384
aVand third, we don't know whether we are doing the right thing.
p385
aVThere's no silver bullet.
p386
aVYou cannot helicopter people out of poverty.
p387
aVAnd that's very frustrating.
p388
aa(lp389
VBut look what we just did today.
p390
aVI gave you three simple answers to three questions:
p391
aVGive lentils to immunize people,
p392
aVprovide free bed nets, deworm children.
p393
aVWith immunization or bed nets,
p394
aVyou can save a life for 300 dollars per life saved.
p395
aVWith deworming, you can get
p396
aVan extra year of education for three dollars.
p397
aVSo we cannot eradicate poverty just yet,
p398
aVbut we can get started.
p399
aVAnd maybe we can get started small
p400
aVwith things that we know are effective.
p401
aa(lp402
VHere's an example of how this can be powerful.
p403
aVDeworming.
p404
aVWorms have a little bit of a problem grabbing the headlines.
p405
aVThey are not beautiful and don't kill anybody.
p406
aVAnd yet, when the young global leader in Davos
p407
aVshowed the numbers I gave you,
p408
aVthey started Deworm the World.
p409
aVAnd thanks to Deworm the World,
p410
aVand the effort of many country governments and foundations,
p411
aV20 million school-aged children got dewormed in 2009.
p412
aVSo this evidence is powerful.
p413
aVIt can prompt action.
p414
aa(lp415
VSo we should get started now.
p416
aVIt's not going to be easy.
p417
aVIt's a very slow process.
p418
aVYou have to keep experimenting, and sometimes ideology
p419
aVhas to be trumped by practicality.
p420
aVAnd sometimes what works somewhere doesn't work elsewhere.
p421
aVSo it's a slow process,
p422
aVbut there is no other way.
p423
aVThese economics I'm proposing,
p424
aVit's like 20th century medicine.
p425
aVIt's a slow, deliberative process
p426
aVof discovery.
p427
aVThere is no miracle cure,
p428
aVbut modern medicine is saving
p429
aVmillions of lives every year,
p430
aVand we can do the same thing.
p431
aa(lp432
VAnd now, maybe, we can go back to the bigger question
p433
aVthat I started with at the beginning.
p434
aVI cannot tell you
p435
aVwhether the aid we have spent in the past has made a difference,
p436
aVbut can we come back here in 30 years
p437
aVand say, "What we have done,
p438
aVit really prompted a change for the better."
p439
aVI believe we can and I hope we will.
p440
