(lp3
VIt's a great time to be a molecular biologist. (Laughter)
p4
aVReading and writing DNA code is getting easier
p5
aVand cheaper.
p6
aVBy the end of this year, we'll be able to sequence
p7
aVthe three million bits of information
p8
aVin your genome in less than a day
p9
aVand for less than 1,000 euros.
p10
aVBiotech is probably the most powerful
p11
aVand the fastest-growing technology sector.
p12
aVIt has the power, potentially,
p13
aVto replace our fossil fuels,
p14
aVto revolutionize medicine,
p15
aVand to touch every aspect of our daily lives.
p16
aa(lp17
VSo who gets to do it?
p18
aVI think we'd all be pretty comfortable with
p19
aVthis guy doing it.
p20
aVBut what about
p21
aVthat guy? (Laughter)
p22
aV(Laughter)
p23
aa(lp24
VIn 2009, I first heard about DIYbio.
p25
aVIt's a movement that \u2014 it advocates making biotechnology
p26
aVaccessible to everyone,
p27
aVnot just scientists and people in government labs.
p28
aVThe idea is that if you open up the science
p29
aVand you allow diverse groups to participate,
p30
aVit could really stimulate innovation.
p31
aVPutting technology in the hands of the end user
p32
aVis usually a good idea because they've got the best idea
p33
aVof what their needs are.
p34
aVAnd here's this really sophisticated technology
p35
aVcoming down the road, all these associated
p36
aVsocial, moral, ethical questions,
p37
aVand we scientists are just lousy at explaining to the public
p38
aVjust exactly what it is we're doing in those labs.
p39
aVSo wouldn't it be nice
p40
aVif there was a place in your local neighborhood
p41
aVwhere you could go and learn about this stuff,
p42
aVdo it hands-on?
p43
aVI thought so.
p44
aa(lp45
VSo, three years ago, I got together
p46
aVwith some friends of mine who had similar aspirations
p47
aVand we founded Genspace.
p48
aVIt's a nonprofit, a community biotech lab
p49
aVin Brooklyn, New York,
p50
aVand the idea was people could come,
p51
aVthey could take classes and putter around in the lab
p52
aVin a very open, friendly atmosphere.
p53
aa(lp54
VNone of my previous experience prepared me
p55
aVfor what came next. Can you guess?
p56
aVThe press started calling us.
p57
aVAnd the more we talked about how great it was to increase
p58
aVscience literacy, the more they wanted to talk
p59
aVabout us creating the next Frankenstein,
p60
aVand as a result, for the next six months,
p61
aVwhen you Googled my name,
p62
aVinstead of getting my scientific papers, you got this.
p63
aV["Am I a biohazard?"]
p64
aV(Laughter)
p65
aVIt was pretty depressing.
p66
aVThe only thing that got us through that period
p67
aVwas that we knew that all over the world,
p68
aVthere were other people that were trying to do
p69
aVthe same thing that we were.
p70
aVThey were opening biohacker spaces, and some of them
p71
aVwere facing much greater challenges than we did,
p72
aVmore regulations, less resources.
p73
aVBut now, three years later, here's where we stand.
p74
aVIt's a vibrant, global community of hackerspaces,
p75
aVand this is just the beginning.
p76
aVThese are some of the biggest ones,
p77
aVand there are others opening every day.
p78
aVThere's one probably going to open up in Moscow,
p79
aVone in South Korea,
p80
aVand the cool thing is they each have their own
p81
aVindividual flavor
p82
aVthat grew out of the community they came out of.
p83
aa(lp84
VLet me take you on a little tour.
p85
aVBiohackers work alone.
p86
aVWe work in groups,
p87
aVin big cities \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p88
aVand in small villages.
p89
aVWe reverse engineer lab equipment.
p90
aVWe genetically engineer bacteria.
p91
aVWe hack hardware,
p92
aVsoftware,
p93
aVwetware,
p94
aVand, of course, the code of life.
p95
aVWe like to build things.
p96
aVThen we like to take things apart.
p97
aVWe make things grow.
p98
aVWe make things glow.
p99
aVAnd we make cells dance.
p100
aa(lp101
VThe spirit of these labs, it's open, it's positive,
p102
aVbut, you know, sometimes when people think of us,
p103
aVthe first thing that comes to mind is bio-safety,
p104
aVbio-security, all the dark side stuff.
p105
aVI'm not going to minimize those concerns.
p106
aVAny powerful technology is inherently dual use,
p107
aVand, you know, you get something like
p108
aVsynthetic biology, nanobiotechnology,
p109
aVit really compels you, you have to look at both
p110
aVthe amateur groups but also the professional groups,
p111
aVbecause they have better infrastructure,
p112
aVthey have better facilities,
p113
aVand they have access to pathogens.
p114
aa(lp115
VSo the United Nations did just that, and they recently
p116
aVissued a report on this whole area,
p117
aVand what they concluded was the power of this technology
p118
aVfor positive was much greater than the risk for negative,
p119
aVand they even looked specifically at the DIYbio community,
p120
aVand they noted, not surprisingly, that the press
p121
aVhad a tendency to consistently overestimate our capabilities
p122
aVand underestimate our ethics.
p123
aVAs a matter of fact, DIY people from all over the world,
p124
aVAmerica, Europe, got together last year,
p125
aVand we hammered out a common code of ethics.
p126
aVThat's a lot more than conventional science has done.
p127
aa(lp128
VNow, we follow state and local regulations.
p129
aVWe dispose of our waste properly, we follow
p130
aVsafety procedures, we don't work with pathogens.
p131
aVYou know, if you're working with a pathogen,
p132
aVyou're not part of the biohacker community,
p133
aVyou're part of the bioterrorist community, I'm sorry.
p134
aVAnd sometimes people ask me,
p135
aV"Well, what about an accident?"
p136
aVWell, working with the safe organisms that we normally
p137
aVwork with, the chance of an accident happening
p138
aVwith somebody accidentally creating, like,
p139
aVsome sort of superbug,
p140
aVthat's literally about as probable as a snowstorm
p141
aVin the middle of the Sahara Desert.
p142
aVNow, it could happen,
p143
aVbut I'm not going to plan my life around it.
p144
aa(lp145
VI've actually chosen to take a different kind of risk.
p146
aVI signed up for something called the Personal Genome Project.
p147
aVIt's a study at Harvard where, at the end of the study,
p148
aVthey're going to take my entire genomic sequence,
p149
aVall of my medical information, and my identity,
p150
aVand they're going to post it online for everyone to see.
p151
aVThere were a lot of risks involved that they talked about
p152
aVduring the informed consent portion.
p153
aVThe one I liked the best is,
p154
aVsomeone could download my sequence, go back to the lab,
p155
aVsynthesize some fake Ellen DNA,
p156
aVand plant it at a crime scene. (Laughter)
p157
aVBut like DIYbio, the positive outcomes and
p158
aVthe potential for good for a study like that
p159
aVfar outweighs the risk.
p160
aa(lp161
VNow, you might be asking yourself,
p162
aV"Well, you know, what would I do in a biolab?"
p163
aVWell, it wasn't that long ago we were asking, "Well,
p164
aVwhat would anyone do with a personal computer?"
p165
aVSo this stuff is just beginning.
p166
aVWe're only seeing just the tip of the DNA iceberg.
p167
aVLet me show you what you could do right now.
p168
aVA biohacker in Germany, a journalist, wanted to know
p169
aVwhose dog was leaving little presents on his street?
p170
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p171
aVYep, you guessed it. He threw tennis balls
p172
aVto all the neighborhood dogs, analyzed the saliva,
p173
aVidentified the dog, and confronted the dog owner.
p174
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p175
aVI discovered an invasive species in my own backyard.
p176
aVLooked like a ladybug, right?
p177
aVIt actually is a Japanese beetle.
p178
aVAnd the same kind of technology \u2014
p179
aVit's called DNA barcoding, it's really cool \u2014
p180
aVYou can use it to check if your caviar is really beluga,
p181
aVif that sushi is really tuna, or if that goat cheese
p182
aVthat you paid so much for is really goat's.
p183
aVIn a biohacker space, you can analyze your genome
p184
aVfor mutations.
p185
aVYou can analyze your breakfast cereal for GMO's,
p186
aVand you can explore your ancestry.
p187
aVYou can send weather balloons up into the stratosphere,
p188
aVcollect microbes, see what's up there.
p189
aVYou can make a biocensor out of yeast
p190
aVto detect pollutants in water.
p191
aVYou can make some sort of a biofuel cell.
p192
aVYou can do a lot of things.
p193
aVYou can also do an art science project. Some of these
p194
aVare really spectacular, and they look at social,
p195
aVecological problems from a completely different perspective.
p196
aVIt's really cool.
p197
aa(lp198
VSome people ask me, well, why am I involved?
p199
aVI could have a perfectly good career in mainstream science.
p200
aVThe thing is, there's something in these labs
p201
aVthat they have to offer society that you can't find
p202
aVanywhere else.
p203
aVThere's something sacred about a space where
p204
aVyou can work on a project, and you don't have to justify
p205
aVto anyone that it's going to make a lot of money,
p206
aVthat it's going to save mankind, or even that it's feasible.
p207
aVIt just has to follow safety guidelines.
p208
aVIf you had spaces like this all over the world,
p209
aVit could really change the perception
p210
aVof who's allowed to do biotech.
p211
aVIt's spaces like these that spawned personal computing.
p212
aVWhy not personal biotech?
p213
aVIf everyone in this room got involved,
p214
aVwho knows what we could do?
p215
aVThis is such a new area, and as we say back in Brooklyn,
p216
aVyou ain't seen nothin' yet. (Laughter)
