VIn the middle of my Ph.D.,
p4
aVI was hopelessly stuck.
p5
aVEvery research direction that I tried
p6
aVled to a dead end.
p7
aVIt seemed like my basic assumptions
p8
aVjust stopped working.
p9
aVI felt like a pilot flying through the mist,
p10
aVand I lost all sense of direction.
p11
aVI stopped shaving.
p12
aVI couldn't get out of bed in the morning.
p13
aVI felt unworthy
p14
aVof stepping across the gates of the university,
p15
aVbecause I wasn't like Einstein or Newton
p16
aVor any other scientist whose results
p17
aVI had learned about, because in science,
p18
aVwe just learn about the results, not the process.
p19
aVAnd so obviously, I couldn't be a scientist.
p20
aa(lp21
VBut I had enough support
p22
aVand I made it through
p23
aVand discovered something new about nature.
p24
aVThis is an amazing feeling of calmness,
p25
aVbeing the only person in the world
p26
aVwho knows a new law of nature.
p27
aVAnd I started the second project in my Ph.D,
p28
aVand it happened again.
p29
aVI got stuck and I made it through.
p30
aVAnd I started thinking,
p31
aVmaybe there's a pattern here.
p32
aVI asked the other graduate students, and they said,
p33
aV"Yeah, that's exactly what happened to us,
p34
aVexcept nobody told us about it."
p35
aVWe'd all studied science as if it's a series
p36
aVof logical steps between question and answer,
p37
aVbut doing research is nothing like that.
p38
aa(lp39
VAt the same time, I was also studying
p40
aVto be an improvisation theater actor.
p41
aVSo physics by day,
p42
aVand by night, laughing, jumping, singing,
p43
aVplaying my guitar.
p44
aVImprovisation theater,
p45
aVjust like science, goes into the unknown,
p46
aVbecause you have to make a scene onstage
p47
aVwithout a director, without a script,
p48
aVwithout having any idea what you'll portray
p49
aVor what the other characters will do.
p50
aVBut unlike science,
p51
aVin improvisation theater, they tell you from day one
p52
aVwhat's going to happen to you when you get onstage.
p53
aVYou're going to fail miserably.
p54
aVYou're going to get stuck.
p55
aVAnd we would practice staying creative
p56
aVinside that stuck place.
p57
aVFor example, we had an exercise
p58
aVwhere we all stood in a circle,
p59
aVand each person had to do the world's worst tap dance,
p60
aVand everybody else applauded
p61
aVand cheered you on,
p62
aVsupporting you onstage.
p63
aa(lp64
VWhen I became a professor
p65
aVand had to guide my own students
p66
aVthrough their research projects,
p67
aVI realized again,
p68
aVI don't know what to do.
p69
aVI'd studied thousands of hours of physics,
p70
aVbiology, chemistry,
p71
aVbut not one hour, not one concept
p72
aVon how to mentor, how to guide someone
p73
aVto go together into the unknown,
p74
aVabout motivation.
p75
aa(lp76
VSo I turned to improvisation theater,
p77
aVand I told my students from day one
p78
aVwhat's going to happen when you start research,
p79
aVand this has to do with our mental schema
p80
aVof what research will be like.
p81
aVBecause you see, whenever people do anything,
p82
aVfor example if I want to touch this blackboard,
p83
aVmy brain first builds up a schema,
p84
aVa prediction of exactly what my muscles will do
p85
aVbefore I even start moving my hand,
p86
aVand if I get blocked,
p87
aVif my schema doesn't match reality,
p88
aVthat causes extra stress called cognitive dissonance.
p89
aVThat's why your schemas had better match reality.
p90
aVBut if you believe the way science is taught,
p91
aVand if you believe textbooks, you're liable
p92
aVto have the following schema of research.
p93
aVIf A is the question,
p94
aVand B is the answer,
p95
aVthen research is a direct path.
p96
aVThe problem is that if an experiment doesn't work,
p97
aVor a student gets depressed,
p98
aVit's perceived as something utterly wrong
p99
aVand causes tremendous stress.
p100
aVAnd that's why I teach my students
p101
aVa more realistic schema.
p102
aVHere's an example
p103
aVwhere things don't match your schema.
p104
aV(Laughter)
p105
aV(Applause)
p106
aa(lp107
VSo I teach my students a different schema.
p108
aVIf A is the question,
p109
aVB is the answer,
p110
aVstay creative in the cloud,
p111
aVand you start going,
p112
aVand experiments don't work, experiments don't work,
p113
aVexperiments don't work, experiments don't work,
p114
aVuntil you reach a place linked with negative emotions
p115
aVwhere it seems like your basic assumptions
p116
aVhave stopped making sense,
p117
aVlike somebody yanked the carpet beneath your feet.
p118
aVAnd I call this place the cloud.
p119
aVNow you can be lost in the cloud
p120
aVfor a day, a week, a month, a year,
p121
aVa whole career,
p122
aVbut sometimes, if you're lucky enough
p123
aVand you have enough support,
p124
aVyou can see in the materials at hand,
p125
aVor perhaps meditating on the shape of the cloud,
p126
aVa new answer,
p127
aVC, and you decide to go for it.
p128
aVAnd experiments don't work, experiments don't work,
p129
aVbut you get there,
p130
aVand then you tell everyone about it
p131
aVby publishing a paper that reads A arrow C,
p132
aVwhich is a great way to communicate,
p133
aVbut as long as you don't forget the path
p134
aVthat brought you there.
p135
aa(lp136
VNow this cloud is an inherent part
p137
aVof research, an inherent part of our craft,
p138
aVbecause the cloud stands guard at the boundary.
p139
aVIt stands guard at the boundary
p140
aVbetween the known
p141
aVand the unknown,
p142
aVbecause in order to discover something truly new,
p143
aVat least one of your basic assumptions has to change,
p144
aVand that means that in science,
p145
aVwe do something quite heroic.
p146
aVEvery day, we try to bring ourselves
p147
aVto the boundary between the known and the unknown
p148
aVand face the cloud.
p149
aa(lp150
VNow notice that I put B
p151
aVin the land of the known,
p152
aVbecause we knew about it in the beginning,
p153
aVbut C is always more interesting
p154
aVand more important than B.
p155
aVSo B is essential in order to get going,
p156
aVbut C is much more profound,
p157
aVand that's the amazing thing about resesarch.
p158
aa(lp159
VNow just knowing that word, the cloud,
p160
aVhas been transformational in my research group,
p161
aVbecause students come to me and say,
p162
aV"Uri, I'm in the cloud,"
p163
aVand I say, "Great, you must be feeling miserable."
p164
aV(Laughter)
p165
aVBut I'm kind of happy,
p166
aVbecause we might be close to the boundary
p167
aVbetween the known and the unknown,
p168
aVand we stand a chance of discovering
p169
aVsomething truly new,
p170
aVsince the way our mind works,
p171
aVit's just knowing that the cloud
p172
aVis normal, it's essential,
p173
aVand in fact beautiful,
p174
aVwe can join the Cloud Appreciation Society,
p175
aVand it detoxifies the feeling that something
p176
aVis deeply wrong with me.
p177
aVAnd as a mentor, I know what to do,
p178
aVwhich is to step up my support for the student,
p179
aVbecause research in psychology shows
p180
aVthat if you're feeling fear and despair,
p181
aVyour mind narrows down
p182
aVto very safe and conservative ways of thinking.
p183
aVIf you'd like to explore the risky paths
p184
aVneeded to get out of the cloud,
p185
aVyou need other emotions \u2014
p186
aVsolidarity, support, hope \u2014
p187
aVthat come with your connection from somebody else,
p188
aVso like in improvisation theater,
p189
aVin science, it's best to walk into the unknown
p190
aVtogether.
p191
aa(lp192
VSo knowing about the cloud,
p193
aVyou also learn from improvisation theater
p194
aVa very effective way to have conversations
p195
aVinside the cloud.
p196
aVIt's based on the central principle
p197
aVof improvisation theater,
p198
aVso here improvisation theater
p199
aVcame to my help again.
p200
aVIt's called saying "Yes, and"
p201
aVto the offers made by other actors.
p202
aVThat means accepting the offers
p203
aVand building on them, saying, "Yes, and."
p204
aVFor example, if one actor says,
p205
aV"Here is a pool of water,"
p206
aVand the other actor says,
p207
aV"No, that's just a stage,"
p208
aVthe improvisation is over.
p209
aVIt's dead, and everybody feels frustrated.
p210
aVThat's called blocking.
p211
aVIf you're not mindful of communications,
p212
aVscientific conversations can have a lot of blocking.
p213
aa(lp214
VSaying "Yes, and" sounds like this.
p215
aa(lp216
V"Here is a pool of water." "Yeah, let's jump in."
p217
aa(lp218
V"Look, there's a whale! Let's grab it by its tail.
p219
aVIt's pulling us to the moon!"
p220
aa(lp221
VSo saying "Yes, and" bypasses our inner critic.
p222
aVWe all have an inner critic
p223
aVthat kind of guards what we say,
p224
aVso people don't think that we're obscene
p225
aVor crazy or unoriginal,
p226
aVand science is full of the fear
p227
aVof appearing unoriginal.
p228
aVSaying "Yes, and" bypasses the critic
p229
aVand unlocks hidden voices of creativity
p230
aVyou didn't even know that you had,
p231
aVand they often carry the answer
p232
aVabout the cloud.
p233
aa(lp234
VSo you see, knowing about the cloud
p235
aVand about saying "Yes, and"
p236
aVmade my lab very creative.
p237
aVStudents started playing off of each others' ideas,
p238
aVand we made surprising discoveries
p239
aVin the interface between physics and biology.
p240
aVFor example, we were stuck for a year
p241
aVtrying to understand the intricate
p242
aVbiochemical networks inside our cells,
p243
aVand we said, "We are deeply in the cloud,"
p244
aVand we had a playful conversation
p245
aVwhere my student Shai Shen Orr said,
p246
aV"Let's just draw this on a piece of paper, this network,"
p247
aVand instead of saying,
p248
aV"But we've done that so many times
p249
aVand it doesn't work,"
p250
aVI said, "Yes, and
p251
aVlet's use a very big piece of paper,"
p252
aVand then Ron Milo said,
p253
aV"Let's use a gigantic architect's
p254
aVblueprint kind of paper, and I know where to print it,"
p255
aVand we printed out the network and looked at it,
p256
aVand that's where we made our most important discovery,
p257
aVthat this complicated network is just made
p258
aVof a handful of simple, repeating interaction patterns
p259
aVlike motifs in a stained glass window.
p260
aVWe call them network motifs,
p261
aVand they're the elementary circuits
p262
aVthat help us understand
p263
aVthe logic of the way cells make decisions
p264
aVin all organisms, including our body.
p265
aa(lp266
VSoon enough, after this,
p267
aVI started being invited to give talks
p268
aVto thousands of scientists across the world,
p269
aVbut the knowledge about the cloud
p270
aVand saying "Yes, and"
p271
aVjust stayed within my own lab,
p272
aVbecause you see, in science, we don't talk about the process,
p273
aVanything subjective or emotional.
p274
aVWe talk about the results.
p275
aVSo there was no way to talk about it in conferences.
p276
aVThat was unthinkable.
p277
aVAnd I saw scientists in other groups get stuck
p278
aVwithout even having a word to describe
p279
aVwhat they're seeing,
p280
aVand their ways of thinking
p281
aVnarrowed down to very safe paths,
p282
aVtheir science didn't reach its full potential,
p283
aVand they were miserable.
p284
aVI thought, that's the way it is.
p285
aVI'll try to make my lab as creative as possible,
p286
aVand if everybody else does the same,
p287
aVscience will eventually become
p288
aVmore and more better and better.
p289
aa(lp290
VThat way of thinking got turned on its head
p291
aVwhen by chance I went to hear Evelyn Fox Keller
p292
aVgive a talk about her experiences
p293
aVas a woman in science.
p294
aVAnd she asked,
p295
aV"Why is it that we don't talk about the subjective
p296
aVand emotional aspects of doing science?
p297
aVIt's not by chance. It's a matter of values."
p298
aVYou see, science seeks knowledge
p299
aVthat's objective and rational.
p300
aVThat's the beautiful thing about science.
p301
aVBut we also have a cultural myth
p302
aVthat the doing of science,
p303
aVwhat we do every day to get that knowledge,
p304
aVis also only objective and rational,
p305
aVlike Mr. Spock.
p306
aVAnd when you label something
p307
aVas objective and rational,
p308
aVautomatically, the other side,
p309
aVthe subjective and emotional,
p310
aVbecome labeled as non-science
p311
aVor anti-science or threatening to science,
p312
aVand we just don't talk about it.
p313
aVAnd when I heard that,
p314
aVthat science has a culture,
p315
aVeverything clicked into place for me,
p316
aVbecause if science has a culture,
p317
aVculture can be changed,
p318
aVand I can be a change agent
p319
aVworking to change the culture of science wherever I could.
p320
aVAnd so the very next lecture I gave in a conference,
p321
aVI talked about my science,
p322
aVand then I talked about the importance
p323
aVof the subjective and emotional aspects of doing science
p324
aVand how we should talk about them,
p325
aVand I looked at the audience,
p326
aVand they were cold.
p327
aVThey couldn't hear what I was saying
p328
aVin the context of a 10 back-to-back
p329
aVPowerPoint presentation conference.
p330
aVAnd I tried again and again, conference after conference,
p331
aVbut I wasn't getting through.
p332
aVI was in the cloud.
p333
aa(lp334
VAnd eventually I managed to get out the cloud
p335
aVusing improvisation and music.
p336
aVSince then, every conference I go to,
p337
aVI give a science talk and a second, special talk
p338
aVcalled "Love and fear in the lab,"
p339
aVand I start it off by doing a song
p340
aVabout scientists' greatest fear,
p341
aVwhich is that we work hard,
p342
aVwe discover something new,
p343
aVand somebody else publishes it before we do.
p344
aVWe call it being scooped,
p345
aVand being scooped feels horrible.
p346
aVIt makes us afraid to talk to each other,
p347
aVwhich is no fun,
p348
aVbecause we came to science to share our ideas
p349
aVand to learn from each other,
p350
aVand so I do a blues song,
p351
aVwhich \u2014 (Applause) \u2014
p352
aVcalled "Scooped Again,"
p353
aVand I ask the audience to be my backup singers,
p354
aVand I tell them, "Your text is 'Scoop, Scoop.'"
p355
aVIt sounds like this: "Scoop, scoop!"
p356
aVSounds like this.
p357
aa(lp358
V\u266a I've been scooped again \u266a
p359
aa(lp360
V\u266a Scoop! Scoop! \u266a
p361
aa(lp362
VAnd then we go for it.
p363
aa(lp364
V\u266a I've been scooped again \u266a
p365
aa(lp366
V\u266a Scoop! Scoop! \u266a
p367
aa(lp368
V\u266a I've been scooped again \u266a
p369
aa(lp370
V\u266a Scoop! Scoop! \u266a
p371
aa(lp372
V\u266a I've been scooped again \u266a
p373
aa(lp374
V\u266a Scoop! Scoop! \u266a
p375
aa(lp376
V\u266a I've been scooped again \u266a
p377
aa(lp378
V\u266a Scoop! Scoop! \u266a
p379
aa(lp380
V\u266a Oh mama, can't you feel my pain \u266a
p381
aa(lp382
V\u266a Heavens help me, I've been scooped again \u266a
p383
aV(Applause)
p384
aa(lp385
VThank you.
p386
aVThank you for your backup singing.
p387
aa(lp388
VSo everybody starts laughing, starts breathing,
p389
aVnotices that there's other scientists around them
p390
aVwith shared issues,
p391
aVand we start talking about the emotional
p392
aVand subjective things that go on in research.
p393
aVIt feels like a huge taboo has been lifted.
p394
aVFinally, we can talk about this in a scientific conference.
p395
aVAnd scientists have gone on to form peer groups
p396
aVwhere they meet regularly
p397
aVand create a space to talk about the emotional
p398
aVand subjective things that happen as they're mentoring,
p399
aVas they're going into the unknown,
p400
aVand even started courses
p401
aVabout the process of doing science,
p402
aVabout going into the unknown together,
p403
aVand many other things.
p404
aa(lp405
VSo my vision is that,
p406
aVjust like every scientist knows the word "atom,"
p407
aVthat matter is made out of atoms,
p408
aVevery scientist would know the words
p409
aVlike "the cloud," saying "Yes, and,"
p410
aVand science will become much more creative,
p411
aVmake many, many more unexpected discoveries
p412
aVfor the benefit of us all,
p413
aVand would also be much more playful.
p414
aVAnd what I might ask you to remember from this talk
p415
aVis that next time you face
p416
aVa problem you can't solve
p417
aVin work or in life,
p418
aVthere's a word for what you're going to see:
p419
aVthe cloud.
p420
aVAnd you can go through the cloud
p421
aVnot alone but together
p422
aVwith someone who is your source of support
p423
aVto say "Yes, and" to your ideas,
p424
aVto help you say "Yes, and" to your own ideas,
p425
aVto increase the chance that,
p426
aVthrough the wisps of the cloud,
p427
aVyou'll find that moment of calmness
p428
aVwhere you get your first glimpse
p429
aVof your unexpected discovery,
p430
aVyour C.
p431
aa(lp432
VThank you.
