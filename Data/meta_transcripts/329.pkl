VNinety-nine percent of us have the dream of listeners.
p4
aVNot being the musicians \u2014 the listeners, right?
p5
aVAnd we crave one thing,
p6
aVeven though we kind of don't know it all the time.
p7
aVWe crave to be in the room with the musician
p8
aVthe day it was recorded, the day it was played.
p9
aVAnd we go to live concerts, and we get that as much as we can.
p10
aVBut then we listen to the other 99 percent of our stuff recorded.
p11
aVAnd it turns out the further back you go in history,
p12
aVthe little rougher it sounds.
p13
aVAnd so we said, there's a solution to this.
p14
aVLet's separate the performance, as a thing,
p15
aVout from the recording, which was how it was made.
p16
aVYou know, the thing with microphones in the room and all that day.
p17
aVBut the performance itself was how the musicians worked their fingers,
p18
aVand what instruments they were using.
p19
aVAnd it's the data hidden inside the recording.
p20
aVIn order to do this, it's a lot of hardware and software
p21
aVthat runs in a very high resolution.
p22
aVAnd Yamaha makes an incredible thing called the Disklavier Pro
p23
aVthat looks like a nice grand piano there.
p24
aVAnd you probably didn't realize it's going to do all these things \u2014
p25
aVbut full of solenoids, and fiber optics, and computers
p26
aVand all this kind of stuff. The highest resolution out of Japan.
p27
aVAnd this just didn't work until we could cross this line that says high-definition.
p28
aVAnd we were able to cross this line, called the uncanny valley,
p29
aVin terms of \u2014 artificial intelligence terms.
p30
aVWe have a process where we, you know,
p31
aVkind of put it into the computer and digitize it, and then a whole lot of analysis.
p32
aVAnd we look at every single note,
p33
aVand all the attributes of those notes:
p34
aVhow hard they were struck, and how they were held down,
p35
aVand how you move the fingers.
p36
aVSo we had to develop a whole new science of how you move your fingers.
p37
aVAnd, you know, it's a thing your piano teacher teaches you,
p38
aVbut we never had a science behind these kinds of things.
p39
aa(lp40
VI'm going to start with Glenn Gould.
p41
aVHe died 25 years ago this year, and was born 75 years ago this year.
p42
aVWas a beloved pianist, maybe the great cult pianist of the twentieth century.
p43
aVHe just got tired of being in front of an audience,
p44
aVand felt like \u2014 a performing monkey was, in fact, his term.
p45
aVSo he stepped back, and did nothing but the crafting of his work.
p46
aVAnd Gould's specialty was playing Bach.
p47
aVHis maybe most famous recording
p48
aVwas something called "The Goldberg Variations."
p49
aVBach only wrote themes and variations one time.
p50
aVHe wrote some early pieces,
p51
aVbut late in his life, in his mature period,
p52
aVhe said, "Here's a theme \u2014 30 variations."
p53
aVIn fact, the theme isn't even the melody, it's the bass line.
p54
aVAnd Gould recorded it in two major recordings that you may know about,
p55
aVone in mono, and one in stereo.
p56
aVAnd the one in mono, by the way, he used the pedal,
p57
aVand as he got older, he said, "No, no, wait a minute.
p58
aVI'm going to get very scientific about this, and not use the pedal."
p59
aVWhat I'd like you to hear live is the 1955 version,
p60
aVand we'll play the first couple pieces of it.
p61
aVGlenn Gould, 1955.
p62
aV(Music)
p63
aVHow about that?
p64
aV(Applause)
p65
aa(lp66
VSo let me tell you a little bit how this was done.
p67
aVFirst of all, let me get you to the end step.
p68
aVThis is \u2014 we have a fairly complex process
p69
aVthat, you know, software and musicians and so on,
p70
aVbut when we're all done, we know that the ear is the final arbiter.
p71
aVWe can play the original in one ear, and a new recording in the other.
p72
aVSo I'm going to do this for you right now, what you just heard.
p73
aVAnd in the right speaker is going to be the original recording,
p74
aVand the left speaker is going to be the new recording,
p75
aVactually of an instrument just like that one,
p76
aVand I'm going to play them together at the same time.
p77
aV(Music)
p78
aVThat's the original. [Unclear] That's the two together.
p79
aV(Music)
p80
aa(lp81
VBefore "Jurassic Park,"
p82
aVthere was no science for how skin hung off of muscle, right?
p83
aVSo, in the video world,
p84
aVwe've been able to invent, in our lifetimes, natural behavior.
p85
aVAnd this is kind of another example
p86
aVof putting a science behind natural behavior.
p87
aVAnd then you heard the original.
p88
aVUltimately, I started with the experience.
p89
aVAnd the experience is: I want to be in the room and hear the musicians.
p90
aVLots of you can afford to buy one of these.
p91
aVBut, if not, there is now high-definition surround sound.
p92
aVAnd I got to tell you, if you haven't heard high-definition surround,
p93
aVgo down to your audio dealer, your audiophile dealer.
p94
aVIt's so involving compared to regular stereo.
p95
aVBut if you don't have that, maybe you can listen on your headphones.
p96
aVAnd so on the same disk we have five recordings \u2014
p97
aVSony has five recordings.
p98
aVAnd you could listen in headphones
p99
aVwith this thing called binaural recording.
p100
aVAnd it's a dummy head that sits in front of the instrument,
p101
aVand it's got microphones where the ears are.
p102
aVAnd when you put on headphones, and you listen to this,
p103
aVyou're inside of Glenn Gould's body.
p104
aVAnd it is a chuckle until, you know, the musicians,
p105
aVwho are musicians who play the piano, listen to this, say,
p106
aV"I can't believe it! It's just what it's like to play the piano."
p107
aVExcept now you're inside Glenn Gould's body playing the piano,
p108
aVand it feels like your fingers are making the decisions
p109
aVand moving through the whole process.
p110
aVIt's a game changer.
p111
aa(lp112
VHere's now something we know in spectacular quality.
p113
aVThe whole process is very sensitive to temperature and humidity.
p114
aVWhat you heard today was not perfect.
p115
aVIt's an amalgam of wood, and cast iron, and felt,
p116
aVand steel strings, and all these,
p117
aVand they're all amazingly sensitive to temperature and humidity.
p118
aVSo when you go into the recording session,
p119
aVyou get to stop after every piece and rebuild the piano if you need to.
p120
aVThere's the whole action there, sitting, kind of, on the side,
p121
aVand the dummy head and our recording engineers
p122
aVstanding around while we rebuild the piano.
p123
aVWithout putting dates next to these things,
p124
aVstep-by-step music will be turned into data,
p125
aVlike every field that's occurred in the past 35 or 40 years.
p126
aVAudio has come very late to this game \u2014
p127
aVI'm not talking about digitizing, and bits, and re-mastering.
p128
aVI'm talking about turn it into the data that it was made from,
p129
aVwhich is how it was performed.
p130
aVAnd audio came very late because our ears are so hard to fool \u2014
p131
aVthey're high-resolution, and they're wired straight to our emotions,
p132
aVand you can't trick them very easily.
p133
aVYour eyes are pretty happy with some color and movement, you know.
p134
aa(lp135
VAll right, there's this episode of "Star Trek."
p136
aV(Laughter)
p137
aVI get it \u2014 it was all just laid in for me yesterday there.
p138
aVThe episode of "Star Trek" for me was James Daly played Methuselah \u2014
p139
aVremember this one?
p140
aVAnd at some point he's dancing with his \u2014
p141
aVand I won't ruin the episode for you, from 1967.
p142
aVRight, do you know where I'm going?
p143
aVAnd Nimoy, I'm sorry, Spock sits down at the piano,
p144
aVand he starts playing this Brahms waltz, and they all dance to it.
p145
aVAnd then Spock turns round, he goes,
p146
aV"James, I know all of the Brahms waltzes,
p147
aVand I don't believe this is one of them in the category."
p148
aVThat's where I'm at.
p149
aVI want to hear the waltzes Brahms didn't write.
p150
aVI want to hear the pieces that Horowitz didn't play.
p151
aVBut I believe we're on a path now, when we get to data,
p152
aVthat we can distill styles, and templates, and formulas, and all these kinds of things,
p153
aVagain, that you've seen happen in the computer graphics world.
p154
aVIt's now coming in this world.
p155
aVThe transition will be this one.
p156
aVIt says right now, we think music is notes and how they're played.
p157
aVAnd I believe this is coming.
p158
aVBecause what you've just heard was a computer playing data \u2014
p159
aVno Glenn Gould in the room.
p160
aVBut yet, it was human.
p161
aVAnd I believe you'll get to the next step, the real dream of listeners.
p162
aVEvery time you listen to a recording today,
p163
aVevery time you take out your iPod and whatever,
p164
aVevery time you listen to it, it's the same thing \u2014 it's frozen.
p165
aVWouldn't it be cool if every time you listened, it could be different?
p166
aVThis morning, you're sadder, you want to hear your song,
p167
aVthe same song, played sadder than you did yesterday.
p168
aVYou want to hear it played by different musicians.
p169
aVYou want to hear it in different rooms and whatever.
p170
aa(lp171
VWe've seen all these "Star Treks," and they're all holodeck episodes as well.
p172
aVEvery time I listen to that, I get goose bumps.
p173
aVIt's so amazing, it's so exciting.
p174
aVEvery time I listen to that recording it's like, "Oh my God,
p175
aVI can't believe I'm in the same room. I can't believe this is happening."
p176
aVIt's a way better experience
p177
aVthan whatever you're used to listening to, in whatever form.
p178
aVAnd lastly, I will wrap up with one minute of Art Tatum.
p179
aVSo I've really overshot my budget here.
p180
aVWe made a new recording of him
p181
aVplaying in the Shrine Auditorium in September.
p182
aVIt was a concert he recorded in the Shrine Auditorium in 1949.
p183
aVAnd I've got to tell you, we have this lab
p184
aVwhere we build and measure everything, back in Raleigh, North Carolina,
p185
aVand we flew out to Los Angeles.
p186
aVAnd as the president of the company,
p187
aVI didn't feel real comfortable about where we were.
p188
aVThat's a real uncomfortable feeling,
p189
aVwhen all the equipment's come out and a whole Sony team,
p190
aVand people are going to be sitting there in the audience.
p191
aVAnd we put the piano on the sweet spot of the stage in the Shrine,
p192
aVwhich has not changed since 1949, still seats 6,000 people.
p193
aVAnd on the sweet spot on the stage, Tatum starts playing ...
p194
aVand every note, every beat, every slur, every accent, every pedal
p195
aVwas perfect, because he played it for that room on that day.
p196
aVAnd we captured all that data all over again.
p197
aVAnd I want you to hear that right now.
p198
aVAnd fortunately, it's right in here.
p199
aVThis is an encore he used to do.
p200
aVIt's one minute long.
p201
aVIt's an Irish jig, and I want you to hear his humor.
p202
aV(Music)
p203
aV(Applause)
p204
aVAnd that's just what the live audience did.
p205
aV(Applause)
p206
aVSo thank you very much, Michael, thank you for the opportunity.
