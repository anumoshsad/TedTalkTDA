VI was 10 years old when I learned what the word "genocide" meant.
p4
aVIt was 2003,
p5
aVand my people were being brutally attacked because of their race \u2014
p6
aVhundreds of thousands murdered,
p7
aVmillions displaced,
p8
aVa nation torn apart at the hands of its own government.
p9
aa(lp10
VMy mother and father immediately began speaking out against the crisis.
p11
aVI didn't really understand it,
p12
aVexcept for the fact that it was destroying my parents.
p13
aVOne day, I walked in on my mother crying,
p14
aVand I asked her why we are burying so many people.
p15
aVI don't remember the words that she chose
p16
aVto describe genocide to her 10-year-old daughter,
p17
aVbut I remember the feeling.
p18
aVWe felt completely alone,
p19
aVas if no one could hear us,
p20
aVas if we were essentially invisible.
p21
aa(lp22
VThis is when I wrote my first poem about Darfur.
p23
aVI wrote poetry to convince people to hear and see us,
p24
aVand that's how I learned the thing that changed me.
p25
aVIt's easy to be seen.
p26
aVI mean, look at me \u2014 I'm a young African woman with a scarf around my head,
p27
aVan American accent on my tongue
p28
aVand a story that makes even the most brutal of Monday mornings seem inviting.
p29
aVBut it's hard to convince people that they deserve to be seen.
p30
aVI learned this in my high school classroom one day,
p31
aVwhen my teacher asked me to give a presentation about Darfur.
p32
aVI was setting up the projector when a classmate of mine said,
p33
aV"Why do you have to talk about this?
p34
aVCan't you think about us and how it will make us feel?"
p35
aa(lp36
V(Laughter)
p37
aa(lp38
VMy 14-year-old self didn't know what to say to her,
p39
aVor how to explain the pain that I felt in that moment,
p40
aVand in every moment that we were forced not to talk about "this."
p41
aVHer words took me back to the days and nights on the ground in Darfur,
p42
aVwhere we were forced to remain silent;
p43
aVwhere we didn't speak over morning tea
p44
aVbecause the warplanes overhead would swallow any and all noise;
p45
aVback to the days when we were told
p46
aVnot only that we don't deserve to be heard
p47
aVbut that we do not have a right to exist.
p48
aVAnd this is where the magic happened,
p49
aVin that classroom when all the students started taking their seats
p50
aVand I began to speak,
p51
aVdespite this renewed feeling that I didn't deserve to be there,
p52
aVthat I didn't belong there
p53
aVor have a right to break the silence.
p54
aa(lp55
VAs I talked,
p56
aVand my classmates listened,
p57
aVthe fear ebbed away.
p58
aVMy mind became calm,
p59
aVand I felt safe.
p60
aVIt was the sound of our grieving,
p61
aVthe feel of their arms around me,
p62
aVthe steady walls that held us together.
p63
aVIt felt nothing like a vacuum.
p64
aa(lp65
VI choose poetry because it's so visceral.
p66
aVWhen someone is standing in front of you, mind, body and soul,
p67
aVsaying "Witness me,"
p68
aVit's impossible not to become keenly aware of your own humanity.
p69
aVThis changed everything for me.
p70
aVIt gave me courage.
p71
aVEvery day I experience the power of witness,
p72
aVand because of that, I am whole.
p73
aVAnd so now I ask:
p74
aVWill you witness me?
p75
aa(lp76
VThey hand me the microphone
p77
aVas my shoulders sink under the weight of this stress.
p78
aa(lp79
VThe woman says,
p80
aV"The one millionth refugee just left South Sudan.
p81
aVCan you comment?"
p82
aa(lp83
VI feel my feet rock back and forth on the heels my mother bought,
p84
aa(lp85
Vbegging the question:
p86
aa(lp87
VDo we stay, or is it safer to choose flight?
p88
aa(lp89
VMy mind echoes the numbers:
p90
aa(lp91
Vone million gone,
p92
aa(lp93
Vtwo million displaced,
p94
aa(lp95
V400,000 dead in Darfur.
p96
aa(lp97
VAnd this lump takes over my throat,
p98
aa(lp99
Vas if each of those bodies just found a grave
p100
aa(lp101
Vright here in my esophagus.
p102
aa(lp103
VOur once country,
p104
aa(lp105
Vall north and south and east and west,
p106
aa(lp107
Vso restless the Nile couldn't hold us together,
p108
aa(lp109
Vand you ask me to summarize.
p110
aa(lp111
VThey talk about the numbers as if this isn't still happening,
p112
aa(lp113
Vas if 500,000 didn't just die in Syria,
p114
aa(lp115
Vas if 3,000 aren't still making their final stand
p116
aa(lp117
Vat the bottom of the Mediterranean,
p118
aa(lp119
Vas if there aren't entire volumes full of fact sheets about our genocides,
p120
aa(lp121
Vand now they want me to write one.
p122
aa(lp123
VFact:
p124
aa(lp125
Vwe never talked over breakfast,
p126
aa(lp127
Vbecause the warplanes would swallow our voices.
p128
aa(lp129
VFact:
p130
aa(lp131
Vmy grandfather didn't want to leave home,
p132
aa(lp133
Vso he died in a war zone.
p134
aa(lp135
VFact:
p136
aa(lp137
Va burning bush without God is just a fire.
p138
aa(lp139
VI measure the distance between what I know
p140
aa(lp141
Vand what is safe to say on a microphone.
p142
aa(lp143
VDo I talk about sorrow? Displacement?
p144
aa(lp145
VDo I mention the violence,
p146
aa(lp147
Vhow it's never as simple as what you see on TV,
p148
aa(lp149
Vhow there are weeks' worth of fear before the camera is on?
p150
aa(lp151
VDo I tell her about our bodies,
p152
aa(lp153
Vhow they are 60 percent water,
p154
aa(lp155
Vbut we still burn like driftwood,
p156
aa(lp157
Vmaking fuel of our sacrifice?
p158
aa(lp159
VDo I tell her the men died first, mothers forced to watch the slaughter?
p160
aa(lp161
VThat they came for our children,
p162
aa(lp163
Vscattering them across the continent until our homes sank?
p164
aa(lp165
VThat even castles sink at the bite of the bomb?
p166
aa(lp167
VDo I talk about the elderly,
p168
aVour heroes,
p169
aa(lp170
Vtoo weak to run, too expensive to shoot,
p171
aa(lp172
Vhow they would march them,
p173
aa(lp174
Vhands raised, rifles at their backs,
p175
aVinto the fire?
p176
aa(lp177
VHow their walking sticks kept the flames alive?
p178
aa(lp179
VIt feels too harsh for a bundle of wires and an audience to swallow.
p180
aa(lp181
VToo relentless,
p182
aa(lp183
Vlike the valley that filled with the putrid smoke of our deaths.
p184
aa(lp185
VIs it better in verse?
p186
aa(lp187
VCan a stanza become a burial shroud?
p188
aa(lp189
VWill it sting less if I say it softly?
p190
aa(lp191
VIf you don't see me cry, will you listen better?
p192
aa(lp193
VWill the pain leave when the microphone does?
p194
aa(lp195
VWhy does every word feel as if I'm saying my last?
p196
aa(lp197
VThirty seconds for the sound bite,
p198
aa(lp199
Vand now three minutes for the poem.
p200
aa(lp201
VMy tongue goes dry the same way we died,
p202
aa(lp203
Vbecoming ash, having never been coal.
p204
aa(lp205
VI feel my left leg go numb,
p206
aa(lp207
Vand I realize that I locked my knees,
p208
aVbracing for impact.
p209
aa(lp210
VI never wear shoes I can't run in.
p211
aa(lp212
VThank you.
p213
aa(lp214
V(Applause)
p215
aa(lp216
VSo, I wanted to leave on a positive note,
p217
aVbecause that's the paradox that this life has been:
p218
aVin the places where I learned to cry the most,
p219
aVI also learned how to smile after.
p220
aVSo, here goes.
p221
aa(lp222
V"You Have a Big Imagination
p223
aVor
p224
aV400,000 Ways to Cry."
p225
aa(lp226
VFor Zeinab.
p227
aa(lp228
VI am a sad girl,
p229
aa(lp230
Vbut my face makes other plans,
p231
aa(lp232
Vfocusing energy on this smile, so as not to waste it on pain.
p233
aa(lp234
VThe first thing they took was my sleep,
p235
aa(lp236
Veyes heavy but wide open,
p237
aa(lp238
Vthinking maybe I missed something,
p239
aa(lp240
Vmaybe the cavalry is still coming.
p241
aa(lp242
VThey didn't come,
p243
aa(lp244
Vso I bought bigger pillows.
p245
aa(lp246
V(Laughter)
p247
aa(lp248
VMy grandmother could cure anything
p249
aa(lp250
Vby talking the life out of it.
p251
aa(lp252
VAnd she said that I could make a thief in a silo laugh
p253
aVin the middle of our raging war.
p254
aa(lp255
VWar makes a broken marriage bed out of sorrow.
p256
aa(lp257
VYou want nothing more than to disappear,
p258
aa(lp259
Vbut your heart can't salvage enough remnants to leave.
p260
aa(lp261
VBut joy \u2014
p262
aa(lp263
Vjoy is the armor we carried across the borders of our broken homeland.
p264
aa(lp265
VA hasty mix of stories and faces
p266
aVthat lasts long after the flavor is gone.
p267
aa(lp268
VA muscle memory that overcomes even the most bitter of times,
p269
aa(lp270
Vmy memory is spotted with days of laughing until I cried,
p271
aa(lp272
Vor crying until I laughed.
p273
aa(lp274
VLaughter and tears are both involuntary human reactions,
p275
aa(lp276
Vtestaments to our capacity for expression.
p277
aa(lp278
VSo allow me to express
p279
aa(lp280
Vthat if I make you laugh,
p281
aVit's usually on purpose.
p282
aa(lp283
VAnd if I make you cry,
p284
aVI'll still think you are beautiful.
p285
aa(lp286
VThis is for my cousin Zeinab,
p287
aa(lp288
Vbedridden on a random afternoon.
p289
aa(lp290
VI hadn't seen her since the last time we were in Sudan together,
p291
aa(lp292
Vand there I was at her hospital bedside
p293
aa(lp294
Vin a 400-year-old building in France.
p295
aa(lp296
VZeinab wanted to hear poems.
p297
aa(lp298
VSuddenly, English, Arabic and French were not enough.
p299
aa(lp300
VEvery word I knew became empty noise,
p301
aa(lp302
Vand Zeinab said, "Well, get on with it."
p303
aa(lp304
V(Laughter)
p305
aa(lp306
VAnd I read her everything that I could,
p307
aVand we laughed,
p308
aVand we loved it,
p309
aa(lp310
Vand it was the most important stage that I've ever stood on,
p311
aa(lp312
Vsurrounded by family,
p313
aa(lp314
Vby remnants of a people who were given as a dowry to a relentless war
p315
aa(lp316
Vbut still managed to make pearls of this life;
p317
aa(lp318
Vby the ones who taught me to not only laugh,
p319
aa(lp320
Vbut to live in the face of death;
p321
aa(lp322
Vwho placed their hands across the sky,
p323
aa(lp324
Vmeasuring the distance to the sun and saying, "Smile;
p325
aVI'm gonna meet you there."
p326
aa(lp327
VAnd for Zeinab \u2014
p328
aa(lp329
VZeinab, who taught me love in a place like France,
p330
aa(lp331
VZeinab, who wanted to he.ar poems on her deathbed \u2014
p332
aa(lp333
VDilated fibromyalgia.
p334
aa(lp335
VHer heart muscles expanded
p336
aVuntil they couldn't function.
p337
aa(lp338
VAnd she held me, and she made me feel like gold.
p339
aa(lp340
VAnd I said, "Zeinab,
p341
aa(lp342
Visn't it strange that your only problem
p343
aa(lp344
Vis that your heart was too big?"
p345
aa(lp346
VThank you.
