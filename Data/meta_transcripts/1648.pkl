VSo, before I became a dermatologist,
p4
aVI started in general medicine,
p5
aVas most dermatologists do in Britain.
p6
aVAt the end of that time, I went off to Australia,
p7
aVabout 20 years ago.
p8
aVWhat you learn when you go to Australia
p9
aVis the Australians are very competitive.
p10
aVAnd they are not magnanimous in victory.
p11
aVAnd that happened a lot:
p12
aV"You pommies, you can't play cricket, rugby."
p13
aVI could accept that.
p14
aa(lp15
VBut moving into work \u2014
p16
aVand we have each week what's called a journal club,
p17
aVwhen you'd sit down with the other doctors
p18
aVand you'd study a scientific paper
p19
aVin relation to medicine.
p20
aVAnd after week one, it was about cardiovascular mortality,
p21
aVa dry subject \u2014 how many people die of heart disease,
p22
aVwhat the rates are.
p23
aVAnd they were competitive about this:
p24
aV"You pommies, your rates of heart disease are shocking."
p25
aa(lp26
VAnd of course, they were right.
p27
aVAustralians have about a third less heart disease than we do \u2014
p28
aVless deaths from heart attacks, heart failure, less strokes \u2014
p29
aVthey're generally a healthier bunch.
p30
aVAnd of course they said this was because of
p31
aVtheir fine moral standing, their exercise,
p32
aVbecause they're Australians and we're weedy pommies, and so on.
p33
aa(lp34
VBut it's not just Australia that has better health than Britain.
p35
aVWithin Britain, there is a gradient of health \u2014
p36
aVand this is what's called standardized mortality,
p37
aVbasically your chances of dying.
p38
aVThis is looking at data from the paper about 20 years ago,
p39
aVbut it's true today.
p40
aVComparing your rates of dying 50 degrees north \u2014
p41
aVthat's the South, that's London and places \u2014
p42
aVby latitude, and 55 degrees \u2014
p43
aVthe bad news is that's here, Glasgow.
p44
aVI'm from Edinburgh. Worse news, that's even Edinburgh.
p45
aa(lp46
V(Laughter)
p47
aa(lp48
VSo what accounts for this horrible space here
p49
aVbetween us up here in southern Scotland
p50
aVand the South?
p51
aVNow, we know about smoking,
p52
aVdeep-fried Mars bars, chips \u2014 the Glasgow diet.
p53
aVAll of these things.
p54
aVBut this graph is after taking into account
p55
aVall of these known risk factors.
p56
aVThis is after accounting for smoking, social class, diet,
p57
aVall those other known risk factors.
p58
aVWe are left with this missing space
p59
aVof increased deaths the further north you go.
p60
aa(lp61
VNow, sunlight, of course, comes into this.
p62
aVAnd vitamin D has had a great deal of press,
p63
aVand a lot of people get concerned about it.
p64
aVAnd we need vitamin D. It's now a requirement that children have a certain amount.
p65
aVMy grandmother grew up in Glasgow,
p66
aVback in the 1920s and '30s when rickets was a real problem
p67
aVand cod liver oil was brought in.
p68
aVAnd that really prevented the rickets that used to be common in this city.
p69
aVAnd I as a child was fed cod liver oil by my grandmother.
p70
aVI distinctly \u2014 nobody forgets cod liver oil.
p71
aa(lp72
VBut an association: The higher people's blood levels of vitamin D are,
p73
aVthe less heart disease they have, the less cancer.
p74
aVThere seems to be a lot of data suggesting that vitamin D is very good for you.
p75
aVAnd it is, to prevent rickets and so on.
p76
aVBut if you give people vitamin D supplements,
p77
aVyou don't change that high rate of heart disease.
p78
aVAnd the evidence for it preventing cancers is not yet great.
p79
aVSo what I'm going to suggest is that vitamin D is not the only story in town.
p80
aVIt's not the only reason preventing heart disease.
p81
aVHigh vitamin D levels, I think, are a marker for sunlight exposure,
p82
aVand sunlight exposure, in methods I'm going to show,
p83
aVis good for heart disease.
p84
aa(lp85
VAnyway, I came back from Australia,
p86
aVand despite the obvious risks to my health, I moved to Aberdeen.
p87
aV(Laughter)
p88
aVNow, in Aberdeen, I started my dermatology training.
p89
aVBut I also became interested in research,
p90
aVand in particular I became interested in this substance, nitric oxide.
p91
aVNow these three guys up here,
p92
aVFurchgott, Ignarro and Murad,
p93
aVwon the Nobel Prize for medicine back in 1998.
p94
aVAnd they were the first people to describe
p95
aVthis new chemical transmitter, nitric oxide.
p96
aVWhat nitric oxide does is it dilates blood vessels,
p97
aVso it lowers your blood pressure.
p98
aVIt also dilates the coronary arteries, so it stops angina.
p99
aa(lp100
VAnd what was remarkable about it
p101
aVwas in the past when we think of chemical messengers within the body,
p102
aVwe thought of complicated things like estrogen and insulin,
p103
aVor nerve transmission.
p104
aVVery complex processes with very complex chemicals
p105
aVthat fit into very complex receptors.
p106
aVAnd here's this incredibly simple molecule,
p107
aVa nitrogen and an oxygen that are stuck together,
p108
aVand yet these are hugely important for [unclear] our low blood pressure,
p109
aVfor neurotransmission, for many, many things,
p110
aVbut particularly cardiovascular health.
p111
aa(lp112
VAnd I started doing research, and we found, very excitingly,
p113
aVthat the skin produces nitric oxide.
p114
aVSo it's not just in the cardiovascular system it arises.
p115
aVIt arises in the skin.
p116
aVWell, having found that and published that,
p117
aVI thought, well, what's it doing?
p118
aVHow do you have low blood pressure in your skin?
p119
aVIt's not the heart. What do you do?
p120
aa(lp121
VSo I went off to the States, as many people do if they're going to do research,
p122
aVand I spent a few years in Pittsburgh. This is Pittsburgh.
p123
aVAnd I was interested in these really complex systems.
p124
aVWe thought that maybe nitric oxide affected cell death,
p125
aVand how cells survive, and their resistance to other things.
p126
aVAnd I first off started work in cell culture, growing cells,
p127
aVand then I was using knockout mouse models \u2014
p128
aVmice that couldn't make the gene.
p129
aVWe worked out a mechanism, which \u2014 NO was helping cells survive.
p130
aa(lp131
VAnd I then moved back to Edinburgh.
p132
aVAnd in Edinburgh, the experimental animal we use is the medical student.
p133
aVIt's a species close to human,
p134
aVwith several advantages over mice:
p135
aVThey're free, you don't shave them, they feed themselves,
p136
aVand nobody pickets your office saying,
p137
aV"Save the lab medical student."
p138
aVSo they're really an ideal model.
p139
aa(lp140
VBut what we found
p141
aVwas that we couldn't reproduce in man the data we had shown in mice.
p142
aVIt seemed we couldn't turn off the production
p143
aVof nitric oxide in the skin of humans.
p144
aVWe put on creams that blocked the enzyme that made it,
p145
aVwe injected things. We couldn't turn off the nitric oxide.
p146
aa(lp147
VAnd the reason for this, it turned out, after two or three years' work,
p148
aVwas that in the skin we have huge stores
p149
aVnot of nitric oxide, because nitric oxide is a gas,
p150
aVand it's released \u2014 (Poof!) \u2014 and in a few seconds it's away,
p151
aVbut it can be turned into these forms of nitric oxide \u2014
p152
aVnitrate, NO3; nitrite, NO2; nitrosothiols.
p153
aVAnd these are more stable,
p154
aVand your skin has got really large stores of NO.
p155
aVAnd we then thought to ourselves, with those big stores,
p156
aVI wonder if sunlight might activate those stores
p157
aVand release them from the skin,
p158
aVwhere the stores are about 10 times as big as what's in the circulation.
p159
aVCould the sun activate those stores into the circulation,
p160
aVand there in the circulation do its good things for your cardiovascular system?
p161
aa(lp162
VWell, I'm an experimental dermatologist,
p163
aVso what we did was we thought
p164
aVwe'd have to expose our experimental animals to sunlight.
p165
aVAnd so what we did was we took a bunch of volunteers
p166
aVand we exposed them to ultraviolet light.
p167
aVSo these are kind of sunlamps.
p168
aVNow, what we were careful to do was,
p169
aVvitamin D is made by ultraviolet B rays
p170
aVand we wanted to separate our story from the vitamin D story.
p171
aVSo we used ultraviolet A, which doesn't make vitamin D.
p172
aa(lp173
VWhen we put people under a lamp
p174
aVfor the equivalent of about 30 minutes of sunshine in summer in Edinburgh,
p175
aVwhat we produced was, we produced a rise
p176
aVin circulating nitric oxide.
p177
aVSo we put patients with these subjects under the UV,
p178
aVand their NO levels do go up,
p179
aVand their blood pressure goes down.
p180
aVNot by much, as an individual level,
p181
aVbut enough at a population level
p182
aVto shift the rates of heart disease in a whole population.
p183
aVAnd when we shone UV at them,
p184
aVor when we warmed them up to the same level as the lamps,
p185
aVbut didn't actually let the rays hit the skin, this didn't happen.
p186
aVSo this seems to be a feature of ultraviolet rays hitting the skin.
p187
aa(lp188
VNow, we're still collecting data.
p189
aVA few good things here:
p190
aVThis appeared to be more marked in older people.
p191
aVI'm not sure exactly how much.
p192
aVOne of the subjects here was my mother-in-law,
p193
aVand clearly I do not know her age.
p194
aVBut certainly in people older than my wife,
p195
aVthis appears to be a more marked effect.
p196
aVAnd the other thing I should mention
p197
aVwas there was no change in vitamin D.
p198
aVThis is separate from vitamin D.
p199
aVSo vitamin D is good for you \u2014 it stops rickets,
p200
aVit prevents calcium metabolism, important stuff.
p201
aVBut this is a separate mechanism from vitamin D.
p202
aa(lp203
VNow, one of the problems with looking at blood pressure
p204
aVis your body does everything it can
p205
aVto keep your blood pressure at the same place.
p206
aVIf your leg is chopped off and you lose blood,
p207
aVyour body will clamp down, increase the heart rate,
p208
aVdo everything it can to keep your blood pressure up.
p209
aVThat is an absolutely fundamental physiological principle.
p210
aa(lp211
VSo what we've next done
p212
aVis we've moved on to looking at blood vessel dilatation.
p213
aVSo we've measured \u2014 this is again,
p214
aVnotice no tail and hairless, this is a medical student.
p215
aVIn the arm, you can measure blood flow in the arm
p216
aVby how much it swells up as some blood flows into it.
p217
aVAnd what we've shown is that doing a sham irradiation \u2014
p218
aVthis is the thick line here \u2014
p219
aVthis is shining UV on the arm so it warms up
p220
aVbut keeping it covered so the rays don't hit the skin.
p221
aVThere is no change in blood flow, in dilatation of the blood vessels.
p222
aVBut the active irradiation,
p223
aVduring the UV and for an hour after it,
p224
aVthere is dilation of the blood vessels.
p225
aVThis is the mechanism by which you lower blood pressure,
p226
aVby which you dilate the coronary arteries also,
p227
aVto let the blood be supplied with the heart.
p228
aVSo here, further data that ultraviolet \u2014 that's sunlight \u2014
p229
aVhas benefits on the blood flow and the cardiovascular system.
p230
aa(lp231
VSo we thought we'd just kind of model \u2014
p232
aVDifferent amounts of UV hit different parts of the Earth at different times of year,
p233
aVso you can actually work out those stores of nitric oxide \u2014
p234
aVthe nitrates, nitrites, nitrosothiols in the skin \u2014
p235
aVcleave to release NO.
p236
aVDifferent wavelengths of light have different activities of doing that.
p237
aVSo you can look at the wavelengths of light that do that.
p238
aVAnd you can look \u2014 So, if you live on the equator, the sun comes straight overhead,
p239
aVit comes through a very thin bit of atmosphere.
p240
aVIn winter or summer, it's the same amount of light.
p241
aVIf you live up here, in summer
p242
aVthe sun is coming fairly directly down,
p243
aVbut in winter it's coming through a huge amount of atmosphere,
p244
aVand much of the ultraviolet is weeded out,
p245
aVand the range of wavelengths that hit the Earth
p246
aVare different from summer to winter.
p247
aVSo what you can do is you can multiply those data
p248
aVby the NO that's released
p249
aVand you can calculate how much nitric oxide
p250
aVwould be released from the skin into the circulation.
p251
aa(lp252
VNow, if you're on the equator here \u2014
p253
aVthat's these two lines here, the red line and the purple line \u2014
p254
aVthe amount of nitric oxide that's released is the area under the curve,
p255
aVit's the area in this space here.
p256
aVSo if you're on the equator, December or June,
p257
aVyou've got masses of NO being released from the skin.
p258
aVSo Ventura is in southern California.
p259
aVIn summer, you might as well be at the equator.
p260
aVIt's great. Lots of NO is released.
p261
aVVentura mid-winter, well, there's still a decent amount.
p262
aVEdinburgh in summer, the area beneath the curve is pretty good,
p263
aVbut Edinburgh in winter, the amount of NO that can be released
p264
aVis next to nothing, tiny amounts.
p265
aa(lp266
VSo what do we think?
p267
aVWe're still working at this story,
p268
aVwe're still developing it, we're still expanding it.
p269
aVWe think it's very important.
p270
aVWe think it probably accounts for a lot of the north-south health divide within Britain,
p271
aVIt's of relevance to us.
p272
aVWe think that the skin \u2014
p273
aVwell, we know that the skin has got very large stores
p274
aVof nitric oxide as these various other forms.
p275
aVWe suspect a lot of these come from diet,
p276
aVgreen leafy vegetables, beetroot, lettuce
p277
aVhas a lot of these nitric oxides that we think go to the skin.
p278
aVWe think they're then stored in the skin,
p279
aVand we think the sunlight releases this
p280
aVwhere it has generally beneficial effects.
p281
aa(lp282
VAnd this is ongoing work, but dermatologists \u2014
p283
aVI mean, I'm a dermatologist.
p284
aVMy day job is saying to people, "You've got skin cancer,
p285
aVit's caused by sunlight, don't go in the sun."
p286
aVI actually think a far more important message
p287
aVis that there are benefits as well as risks to sunlight.
p288
aVYes, sunlight is the major alterable risk factor for skin cancer,
p289
aVbut deaths from heart disease are a hundred times higher
p290
aVthan deaths from skin cancer.
p291
aVAnd I think that we need to be more aware of,
p292
aVand we need to find the risk-benefit ratio.
p293
aVHow much sunlight is safe,
p294
aVand how can we finesse this best for our general health?
p295
aa(lp296
VSo, thank you very much indeed.
