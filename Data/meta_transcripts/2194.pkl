VIn the mid-'90s,
p4
aVthe CDC and Kaiser Permanente
p5
aVdiscovered an exposure that dramatically increased the risk
p6
aVfor seven out of 10 of the leading causes of death in the United States.
p7
aVIn high doses, it affects brain development,
p8
aVthe immune system, hormonal systems,
p9
aVand even the way our DNA is read and transcribed.
p10
aVFolks who are exposed in very high doses
p11
aVhave triple the lifetime risk of heart disease and lung cancer
p12
aVand a 20-year difference in life expectancy.
p13
aVAnd yet, doctors today are not trained in routine screening or treatment.
p14
aVNow, the exposure I'm talking about is not a pesticide or a packaging chemical.
p15
aVIt's childhood trauma.
p16
aa(lp17
VOkay. What kind of trauma am I talking about here?
p18
aVI'm not talking about failing a test or losing a basketball game.
p19
aVI am talking about threats that are so severe or pervasive
p20
aVthat they literally get under our skin and change our physiology:
p21
aVthings like abuse or neglect,
p22
aVor growing up with a parent  who struggles with mental illness
p23
aVor substance dependence.
p24
aa(lp25
VNow, for a long time,
p26
aVI viewed these things in the way  I was trained to view them,
p27
aVeither as a social problem \u2014 refer to social services \u2014
p28
aVor as a mental health problem \u2014 refer to mental health services.
p29
aVAnd then something happened to make me rethink my entire approach.
p30
aVWhen I finished my residency,
p31
aVI wanted to go someplace where I felt really needed,
p32
aVsomeplace where I could make a difference.
p33
aVSo I came to work for California Pacific Medical Center,
p34
aVone of the best private hospitals in Northern California,
p35
aVand together, we opened a clinic in Bayview-Hunters Point,
p36
aVone of the poorest, most underserved neighborhoods in San Francisco.
p37
aVNow, prior to that point,
p38
aVthere had been only one pediatrician in all of Bayview
p39
aVto serve more than 10,000 children,
p40
aVso we hung a shingle, and we were able to provide top-quality care
p41
aVregardless of ability to pay.
p42
aVIt was so cool. We targeted the typical health disparities:
p43
aVaccess to care, immunization rates, asthma hospitalization rates,
p44
aVand we hit all of our numbers.
p45
aVWe felt very proud of ourselves.
p46
aa(lp47
VBut then I started noticing a disturbing trend.
p48
aVA lot of kids were being referred to me for ADHD,
p49
aVor Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,
p50
aVbut when I actually did a thorough history and physical,
p51
aVwhat I found was that for most of my patients,
p52
aVI couldn't make a diagnosis of ADHD.
p53
aVMost of the kids I was seeing had experienced such severe trauma
p54
aVthat it felt like something else was going on.
p55
aVSomehow I was missing something important.
p56
aa(lp57
VNow, before I did my residency, I did a master's degree in public health,
p58
aVand one of the things that they teach you in public health school
p59
aVis that if you're a doctor
p60
aVand you see 100 kids that all drink from the same well,
p61
aVand 98 of them develop diarrhea,
p62
aVyou can go ahead and write that prescription
p63
aVfor dose after dose after dose of antibiotics,
p64
aVor you can walk over and say, "What the hell is in this well?"
p65
aVSo I began reading everything that I could get my hands on
p66
aVabout how exposure to adversity
p67
aVaffects the developing brains and bodies of children.
p68
aa(lp69
VAnd then one day, my colleague walked into my office,
p70
aVand he said, "Dr. Burke, have you seen this?"
p71
aVIn his hand was a copy of a research study
p72
aVcalled the Adverse Childhood Experiences Study.
p73
aVThat day changed my clinical practice and ultimately my career.
p74
aa(lp75
VThe Adverse Childhood Experiences Study
p76
aVis something that everybody needs to know about.
p77
aVIt was done by Dr. Vince Felitti at Kaiser and Dr. Bob Anda at the CDC,
p78
aVand together, they asked 17,500 adults about their history of exposure
p79
aVto what they called "adverse  childhood experiences," or ACEs.
p80
aVThose include physical, emotional, or sexual abuse;
p81
aVphysical or emotional neglect;
p82
aVparental mental illness, substance dependence, incarceration;
p83
aVparental separation or divorce;
p84
aVor domestic violence.
p85
aVFor every yes, you would get a point on your ACE score.
p86
aVAnd then what they did
p87
aVwas they correlated these ACE scores against health outcomes.
p88
aVWhat they found was striking.
p89
aVTwo things:
p90
aVNumber one, ACEs are incredibly common.
p91
aVSixty-seven percent of the population had at least one ACE,
p92
aVand 12.6 percent, one in eight, had four or more ACEs.
p93
aVThe second thing that they found
p94
aVwas that there was a dose-response relationship
p95
aVbetween ACEs and health outcomes:
p96
aVthe higher your ACE score, the worse your health outcomes.
p97
aVFor a person with an ACE score of four or more,
p98
aVtheir relative risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
p99
aVwas two and a half times that of someone with an ACE score of zero.
p100
aVFor hepatitis, it was also two and a half times.
p101
aVFor depression, it was four and a half times.
p102
aVFor suicidality, it was 12 times.
p103
aVA person with an ACE score of seven or more
p104
aVhad triple the lifetime risk of lung cancer
p105
aVand three and a half times the risk of ischemic heart disease,
p106
aVthe number one killer in the United States of America.
p107
aa(lp108
VWell, of course this makes sense.
p109
aVSome people looked at this data and they said, "Come on.
p110
aVYou have a rough childhood, you're more likely to drink and smoke
p111
aVand do all these things that are going to ruin your health.
p112
aVThis isn't science. This is just bad behavior."
p113
aa(lp114
VIt turns out this is exactly where the science comes in.
p115
aVWe now understand better than we ever have before
p116
aVhow exposure to early adversity
p117
aVaffects the developing brains and bodies of children.
p118
aVIt affects areas like the nucleus accumbens,
p119
aVthe pleasure and reward center of the brain
p120
aVthat is implicated in substance dependence.
p121
aVIt inhibits the prefrontal cortex,
p122
aVwhich is necessary for impulse control and executive function,
p123
aVa critical area for learning.
p124
aVAnd on MRI scans,
p125
aVwe see measurable differences in the amygdala,
p126
aVthe brain's fear response center.
p127
aVSo there are real neurologic reasons
p128
aVwhy folks exposed to high doses of adversity
p129
aVare more likely to engage in high-risk behavior,
p130
aVand that's important to know.
p131
aa(lp132
VBut it turns out that even if you don't engage in any high-risk behavior,
p133
aVyou're still more likely to develop heart disease or cancer.
p134
aVThe reason for this has to do with the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis,
p135
aVthe brain's and body's stress response system
p136
aVthat governs our fight-or-flight response.
p137
aVHow does it work?
p138
aVWell, imagine you're walking in the forest and you see a bear.
p139
aVImmediately, your hypothalamus sends a signal to your pituitary,
p140
aVwhich sends a signal  to your adrenal gland that says,
p141
aV"Release stress hormones! Adrenaline! Cortisol!"
p142
aVAnd so your heart starts to pound,
p143
aVYour pupils dilate, your airways open up,
p144
aVand you are ready to either fight that bear or run from the bear.
p145
aVAnd that is wonderful
p146
aVif you're in a forest and there's a bear.
p147
aV(Laughter)
p148
aVBut the problem is what happens when the bear comes home every night,
p149
aVand this system is activated over and over and over again,
p150
aVand it goes from being adaptive, or life-saving,
p151
aVto maladaptive, or health-damaging.
p152
aVChildren are especially sensitive to this repeated stress activation,
p153
aVbecause their brains and bodies are just developing.
p154
aVHigh doses of adversity not only affect brain structure and function,
p155
aVthey affect the developing immune system,
p156
aVdeveloping hormonal systems,
p157
aVand even the way our DNA is read and transcribed.
p158
aa(lp159
VSo for me, this information threw my old training out the window,
p160
aVbecause when we understand the mechanism of a disease,
p161
aVwhen we know not only which pathways are disrupted, but how,
p162
aVthen as doctors, it is our job to use this science
p163
aVfor prevention and treatment.
p164
aVThat's what we do.
p165
aa(lp166
VSo in San Francisco, we created the Center for Youth Wellness
p167
aVto prevent, screen and heal the impacts of ACEs and toxic stress.
p168
aVWe started simply with routine screening of every one of our kids
p169
aVat their regular physical,
p170
aVbecause I know that if my patient  has an ACE score of 4,
p171
aVshe's two and a half times as likely to develop hepatitis or COPD,
p172
aVshe's four and half times as likely to become depressed,
p173
aVand she's 12 times as likely to attempt to take her own life
p174
aVas my patient with zero ACEs.
p175
aVI know that when she's in my exam room.
p176
aVFor our patients who do screen positive,
p177
aVwe have a multidisciplinary treatment team that works to reduce the dose of adversity
p178
aVand treat symptoms using best practices, including home visits, care coordination,
p179
aVmental health care, nutrition,
p180
aVholistic interventions, and yes, medication when necessary.
p181
aVBut we also educate parents about the impacts of ACEs and toxic stress
p182
aVthe same way you would for covering electrical outlets, or lead poisoning,
p183
aVand we tailor the care of our asthmatics and our diabetics
p184
aVin a way that recognizes that they may need more aggressive treatment,
p185
aVgiven the changes to their hormonal and immune systems.
p186
aa(lp187
VSo the other thing that happens when you understand this science
p188
aVis that you want to shout it from the rooftops,
p189
aVbecause this isn't just an issue for kids in Bayview.
p190
aVI figured the minute that everybody else heard about this,
p191
aVit would be routine screening, multi-disciplinary treatment teams,
p192
aVand it would be a race to the most effective clinical treatment protocols.
p193
aVYeah. That did not happen.
p194
aVAnd that was a huge learning for me.
p195
aVWhat I had thought of as simply best clinical practice
p196
aVI now understand to be a movement.
p197
aVIn the words of Dr. Robert Block,
p198
aVthe former President of the American Academy of Pediatrics,
p199
aV"Adverse childhood experiences
p200
aVare the single greatest unaddressed public health threat
p201
aVfacing our nation today."
p202
aVAnd for a lot of people, that's a terrifying prospect.
p203
aVThe scope and scale of the problem seems so large that it feels overwhelming
p204
aVto think about how we might approach it.
p205
aVBut for me, that's actually where the hopes lies,
p206
aVbecause when we have the right framework,
p207
aVwhen we recognize this to be a public health crisis,
p208
aVthen we can begin to use the right  tool kit to come up with solutions.
p209
aVFrom tobacco to lead poisoning  to HIV/AIDS,
p210
aVthe United States actually has quite a strong track record
p211
aVwith addressing public health problems,
p212
aVbut replicating those successes with ACEs and toxic stress
p213
aVis going to take determination and commitment,
p214
aVand when I look at what our nation's response has been so far,
p215
aVI wonder,
p216
aVwhy haven't we taken this more seriously?
p217
aa(lp218
VYou know, at first I thought that we marginalized the issue
p219
aVbecause it doesn't apply to us.
p220
aVThat's an issue for those kids in those neighborhoods.
p221
aVWhich is weird, because the data doesn't bear that out.
p222
aVThe original ACEs study was done in a population
p223
aVthat was 70 percent Caucasian,
p224
aV70 percent college-educated.
p225
aVBut then, the more I talked to folks,
p226
aVI'm beginning to think that maybe I had it completely backwards.
p227
aVIf I were to ask how many people in this room
p228
aVgrew up with a family member who suffered from mental illness,
p229
aVI bet a few hands would go up.
p230
aVAnd then if I were to ask how many folks had a parent who maybe drank too much,
p231
aVor who really believed that if you spare the rod, you spoil the child,
p232
aVI bet a few more hands would go up.
p233
aVEven in this room, this is an issue that touches many of us,
p234
aVand I am beginning to believe that we marginalize the issue
p235
aVbecause it does apply to us.
p236
aVMaybe it's easier to see in other zip codes
p237
aVbecause we don't want to look at it.
p238
aVWe'd rather be sick.
p239
aa(lp240
VFortunately, scientific advances and, frankly, economic realities
p241
aVmake that option less viable every day.
p242
aVThe science is clear:
p243
aVEarly adversity dramatically affects health across a lifetime.
p244
aVToday, we are beginning to understand how to interrupt the progression
p245
aVfrom early adversity to disease and early death,
p246
aVand 30 years from now,
p247
aVthe child who has a high ACE score
p248
aVand whose behavioral symptoms go unrecognized,
p249
aVwhose asthma management is not connected,
p250
aVand who goes on to develop high blood pressure
p251
aVand early heart disease or cancer
p252
aVwill be just as anomalous as a six-month mortality from HIV/AIDS.
p253
aVPeople will look at that situation and say, "What the heck happened there?"
p254
aVThis is treatable.
p255
aVThis is beatable.
p256
aVThe single most important thing that we need today
p257
aVis the courage to look this problem in the face
p258
aVand say, this is real and this is all of us.
p259
aVI believe that we are the movement.
