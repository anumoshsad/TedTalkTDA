VFor the last 10 years, I've been spending my time trying to figure out
p4
aVhow and why human beings
p5
aVassemble themselves into social networks.
p6
aVAnd the kind of social network I'm talking about
p7
aVis not the recent online variety,
p8
aVbut rather, the kind of social networks
p9
aVthat human beings have been assembling for hundreds of thousands of years,
p10
aVever since we emerged from the African savannah.
p11
aVSo, I form friendships and co-worker
p12
aVand sibling and relative relationships with other people
p13
aVwho in turn have similar relationships with other people.
p14
aVAnd this spreads on out endlessly into a distance.
p15
aVAnd you get a network that looks like this.
p16
aVEvery dot is a person.
p17
aVEvery line between them is a relationship between two people \u2014
p18
aVdifferent kinds of relationships.
p19
aVAnd you can get this kind of vast fabric of humanity,
p20
aVin which we're all embedded.
p21
aa(lp22
VAnd my colleague, James Fowler and I have been studying for quite sometime
p23
aVwhat are the mathematical, social,
p24
aVbiological and psychological rules
p25
aVthat govern how these networks are assembled
p26
aVand what are the similar rules
p27
aVthat govern how they operate, how they affect our lives.
p28
aVBut recently, we've been wondering
p29
aVwhether it might be possible to take advantage of this insight,
p30
aVto actually find ways to improve the world,
p31
aVto do something better,
p32
aVto actually fix things, not just understand things.
p33
aVSo one of the first things we thought we would tackle
p34
aVwould be how we go about predicting epidemics.
p35
aa(lp36
VAnd the current state of the art in predicting an epidemic \u2014
p37
aVif you're the CDC or some other national body \u2014
p38
aVis to sit in the middle where you are
p39
aVand collect data
p40
aVfrom physicians and laboratories in the field
p41
aVthat report the prevalence or the incidence of certain conditions.
p42
aVSo, so and so patients have been diagnosed with something,
p43
aVor other patients have been diagnosed,
p44
aVand all these data are fed into a central repository, with some delay.
p45
aVAnd if everything goes smoothly,
p46
aVone to two weeks from now
p47
aVyou'll know where the epidemic was today.
p48
aVAnd actually, about a year or so ago,
p49
aVthere was this promulgation
p50
aVof the idea of Google Flu Trends, with respect to the flu,
p51
aVwhere by looking at people's searching behavior today,
p52
aVwe could know where the flu \u2014
p53
aVwhat the status of the epidemic was today,
p54
aVwhat's the prevalence of the epidemic today.
p55
aa(lp56
VBut what I'd like to show you today
p57
aVis a means by which we might get
p58
aVnot just rapid warning about an epidemic,
p59
aVbut also actually
p60
aVearly detection of an epidemic.
p61
aVAnd, in fact, this idea can be used
p62
aVnot just to predict epidemics of germs,
p63
aVbut also to predict epidemics of all sorts of kinds.
p64
aVFor example, anything that spreads by a form of social contagion
p65
aVcould be understood in this way,
p66
aVfrom abstract ideas on the left
p67
aVlike patriotism, or altruism, or religion
p68
aVto practices
p69
aVlike dieting behavior, or book purchasing,
p70
aVor drinking, or bicycle-helmet [and] other safety practices,
p71
aVor products that people might buy,
p72
aVpurchases of electronic goods,
p73
aVanything in which there's kind of an interpersonal spread.
p74
aVA kind of a diffusion of innovation
p75
aVcould be understood and predicted
p76
aVby the mechanism I'm going to show you now.
p77
aa(lp78
VSo, as all of you probably know,
p79
aVthe classic way of thinking about this
p80
aVis the diffusion-of-innovation,
p81
aVor the adoption curve.
p82
aVSo here on the Y-axis, we have the percent of the people affected,
p83
aVand on the X-axis, we have time.
p84
aVAnd at the very beginning, not too many people are affected,
p85
aVand you get this classic sigmoidal,
p86
aVor S-shaped, curve.
p87
aVAnd the reason for this shape is that at the very beginning,
p88
aVlet's say one or two people
p89
aVare infected, or affected by the thing
p90
aVand then they affect, or infect, two people,
p91
aVwho in turn affect four, eight, 16 and so forth,
p92
aVand you get the epidemic growth phase of the curve.
p93
aVAnd eventually, you saturate the population.
p94
aVThere are fewer and fewer people
p95
aVwho are still available that you might infect,
p96
aVand then you get the plateau of the curve,
p97
aVand you get this classic sigmoidal curve.
p98
aVAnd this holds for germs, ideas,
p99
aVproduct adoption, behaviors,
p100
aVand the like.
p101
aVBut things don't just diffuse in human populations at random.
p102
aVThey actually diffuse through networks.
p103
aVBecause, as I said, we live our lives in networks,
p104
aVand these networks have a particular kind of a structure.
p105
aa(lp106
VNow if you look at a network like this \u2014
p107
aVthis is 105 people.
p108
aVAnd the lines represent \u2014 the dots are the people,
p109
aVand the lines represent friendship relationships.
p110
aVYou might see that people occupy
p111
aVdifferent locations within the network.
p112
aVAnd there are different kinds of relationships between the people.
p113
aVYou could have friendship relationships, sibling relationships,
p114
aVspousal relationships, co-worker relationships,
p115
aVneighbor relationships and the like.
p116
aVAnd different sorts of things
p117
aVspread across different sorts of ties.
p118
aVFor instance, sexually transmitted diseases
p119
aVwill spread across sexual ties.
p120
aVOr, for instance, people's smoking behavior
p121
aVmight be influenced by their friends.
p122
aVOr their altruistic or their charitable giving behavior
p123
aVmight be influenced by their coworkers,
p124
aVor by their neighbors.
p125
aVBut not all positions in the network are the same.
p126
aa(lp127
VSo if you look at this, you might immediately grasp
p128
aVthat different people have different numbers of connections.
p129
aVSome people have one connection, some have two,
p130
aVsome have six, some have 10 connections.
p131
aVAnd this is called the "degree" of a node,
p132
aVor the number of connections that a node has.
p133
aVBut in addition, there's something else.
p134
aVSo, if you look at nodes A and B,
p135
aVthey both have six connections.
p136
aVBut if you can see this image [of the network] from a bird's eye view,
p137
aVyou can appreciate that there's something very different
p138
aVabout nodes A and B.
p139
aVSo, let me ask you this \u2014 I can cultivate this intuition by asking a question \u2014
p140
aVwho would you rather be
p141
aVif a deadly germ was spreading through the network, A or B?
p142
aV(Audience: B.) Nicholas Christakis: B, it's obvious.
p143
aVB is located on the edge of the network.
p144
aVNow, who would you rather be
p145
aVif a juicy piece of gossip were spreading through the network?
p146
aVA. And you have an immediate appreciation
p147
aVthat A is going to be more likely
p148
aVto get the thing that's spreading and to get it sooner
p149
aVby virtue of their structural location within the network.
p150
aVA, in fact, is more central,
p151
aVand this can be formalized mathematically.
p152
aVSo, if we want to track something
p153
aVthat was spreading through a network,
p154
aVwhat we ideally would like to do is to set up sensors
p155
aVon the central individuals within the network,
p156
aVincluding node A,
p157
aVmonitor those people that are right there in the middle of the network,
p158
aVand somehow get an early detection
p159
aVof whatever it is that is spreading through the network.
p160
aa(lp161
VSo if you saw them contract a germ or a piece of information,
p162
aVyou would know that, soon enough,
p163
aVeverybody was about to contract this germ
p164
aVor this piece of information.
p165
aVAnd this would be much better
p166
aVthan monitoring six randomly chosen people,
p167
aVwithout reference to the structure of the population.
p168
aVAnd in fact, if you could do that,
p169
aVwhat you would see is something like this.
p170
aVOn the left-hand panel, again, we have the S-shaped curve of adoption.
p171
aVIn the dotted red line, we show
p172
aVwhat the adoption would be in the random people,
p173
aVand in the left-hand line, shifted to the left,
p174
aVwe show what the adoption would be
p175
aVin the central individuals within the network.
p176
aVOn the Y-axis is the cumulative instances of contagion,
p177
aVand on the X-axis is the time.
p178
aVAnd on the right-hand side, we show the same data,
p179
aVbut here with daily incidence.
p180
aVAnd what we show here is \u2014 like, here \u2014
p181
aVvery few people are affected, more and more and more and up to here,
p182
aVand here's the peak of the epidemic.
p183
aVBut shifted to the left is what's occurring in the central individuals.
p184
aVAnd this difference in time between the two
p185
aVis the early detection, the early warning we can get,
p186
aVabout an impending epidemic
p187
aVin the human population.
p188
aa(lp189
VThe problem, however,
p190
aVis that mapping human social networks
p191
aVis not always possible.
p192
aVIt can be expensive, not feasible,
p193
aVunethical,
p194
aVor, frankly, just not possible to do such a thing.
p195
aVSo, how can we figure out
p196
aVwho the central people are in a network
p197
aVwithout actually mapping the network?
p198
aVWhat we came up with
p199
aVwas an idea to exploit an old fact,
p200
aVor a known fact, about social networks,
p201
aVwhich goes like this:
p202
aVDo you know that your friends
p203
aVhave more friends than you do?
p204
aVYour friends have more friends than you do,
p205
aVand this is known as the friendship paradox.
p206
aVImagine a very popular person in the social network \u2014
p207
aVlike a party host who has hundreds of friends \u2014
p208
aVand a misanthrope who has just one friend,
p209
aVand you pick someone at random from the population;
p210
aVthey were much more likely to know the party host.
p211
aVAnd if they nominate the party host as their friend,
p212
aVthat party host has a hundred friends,
p213
aVtherefore, has more friends than they do.
p214
aVAnd this, in essence, is what's known as the friendship paradox.
p215
aVThe friends of randomly chosen people
p216
aVhave higher degree, and are more central
p217
aVthan the random people themselves.
p218
aa(lp219
VAnd you can get an intuitive appreciation for this
p220
aVif you imagine just the people at the perimeter of the network.
p221
aVIf you pick this person,
p222
aVthe only friend they have to nominate is this person,
p223
aVwho, by construction, must have at least two
p224
aVand typically more friends.
p225
aVAnd that happens at every peripheral node.
p226
aVAnd in fact, it happens throughout the network as you move in,
p227
aVeveryone you pick, when they nominate a random \u2014
p228
aVwhen a random person nominates a friend of theirs,
p229
aVyou move closer to the center of the network.
p230
aVSo, we thought we would exploit this idea
p231
aVin order to study whether we could predict phenomena within networks.
p232
aVBecause now, with this idea
p233
aVwe can take a random sample of people,
p234
aVhave them nominate their friends,
p235
aVthose friends would be more central,
p236
aVand we could do this without having to map the network.
p237
aa(lp238
VAnd we tested this idea with an outbreak of H1N1 flu
p239
aVat Harvard College
p240
aVin the fall and winter of 2009, just a few months ago.
p241
aVWe took 1,300 randomly selected undergraduates,
p242
aVwe had them nominate their friends,
p243
aVand we followed both the random students and their friends
p244
aVdaily in time
p245
aVto see whether or not they had the flu epidemic.
p246
aVAnd we did this passively by looking at whether or not they'd gone to university health services.
p247
aVAnd also, we had them [actively] email us a couple of times a week.
p248
aVExactly what we predicted happened.
p249
aVSo the random group is in the red line.
p250
aVThe epidemic in the friends group has shifted to the left, over here.
p251
aVAnd the difference in the two is 16 days.
p252
aVBy monitoring the friends group,
p253
aVwe could get 16 days advance warning
p254
aVof an impending epidemic in this human population.
p255
aa(lp256
VNow, in addition to that,
p257
aVif you were an analyst who was trying to study an epidemic
p258
aVor to predict the adoption of a product, for example,
p259
aVwhat you could do is you could pick a random sample of the population,
p260
aValso have them nominate their friends and follow the friends
p261
aVand follow both the randoms and the friends.
p262
aVAmong the friends, the first evidence you saw of a blip above zero
p263
aVin adoption of the innovation, for example,
p264
aVwould be evidence of an impending epidemic.
p265
aVOr you could see the first time the two curves diverged,
p266
aVas shown on the left.
p267
aVWhen did the randoms \u2014 when did the friends take off
p268
aVand leave the randoms,
p269
aVand [when did] their curve start shifting?
p270
aVAnd that, as indicated by the white line,
p271
aVoccurred 46 days
p272
aVbefore the peak of the epidemic.
p273
aVSo this would be a technique
p274
aVwhereby we could get more than a month-and-a-half warning
p275
aVabout a flu epidemic in a particular population.
p276
aa(lp277
VI should say that
p278
aVhow far advanced a notice one might get about something
p279
aVdepends on a host of factors.
p280
aVIt could depend on the nature of the pathogen \u2014
p281
aVdifferent pathogens,
p282
aVusing this technique, you'd get different warning \u2014
p283
aVor other phenomena that are spreading,
p284
aVor frankly, on the structure of the human network.
p285
aVNow in our case, although it wasn't necessary,
p286
aVwe could also actually map the network of the students.
p287
aa(lp288
VSo, this is a map of 714 students
p289
aVand their friendship ties.
p290
aVAnd in a minute now, I'm going to put this map into motion.
p291
aVWe're going to take daily cuts through the network
p292
aVfor 120 days.
p293
aVThe red dots are going to be cases of the flu,
p294
aVand the yellow dots are going to be friends of the people with the flu.
p295
aVAnd the size of the dots is going to be proportional
p296
aVto how many of their friends have the flu.
p297
aVSo bigger dots mean more of your friends have the flu.
p298
aVAnd if you look at this image \u2014 here we are now in September the 13th \u2014
p299
aVyou're going to see a few cases light up.
p300
aVYou're going to see kind of blooming of the flu in the middle.
p301
aVHere we are on October the 19th.
p302
aVThe slope of the epidemic curve is approaching now, in November.
p303
aVBang, bang, bang, bang, bang \u2014 you're going to see lots of blooming in the middle,
p304
aVand then you're going to see a sort of leveling off,
p305
aVfewer and fewer cases towards the end of December.
p306
aVAnd this type of a visualization
p307
aVcan show that epidemics like this take root
p308
aVand affect central individuals first,
p309
aVbefore they affect others.
p310
aa(lp311
VNow, as I've been suggesting,
p312
aVthis method is not restricted to germs,
p313
aVbut actually to anything that spreads in populations.
p314
aVInformation spreads in populations,
p315
aVnorms can spread in populations,
p316
aVbehaviors can spread in populations.
p317
aVAnd by behaviors, I can mean things like criminal behavior,
p318
aVor voting behavior, or health care behavior,
p319
aVlike smoking, or vaccination,
p320
aVor product adoption, or other kinds of behaviors
p321
aVthat relate to interpersonal influence.
p322
aVIf I'm likely to do something that affects others around me,
p323
aVthis technique can get early warning or early detection
p324
aVabout the adoption within the population.
p325
aVThe key thing is that for it to work,
p326
aVthere has to be interpersonal influence.
p327
aVIt cannot be because of some broadcast mechanism
p328
aVaffecting everyone uniformly.
p329
aa(lp330
VNow the same insights
p331
aVcan also be exploited \u2014 with respect to networks \u2014
p332
aVcan also be exploited in other ways,
p333
aVfor example, in the use of targeting
p334
aVspecific people for interventions.
p335
aVSo, for example, most of you are probably familiar
p336
aVwith the notion of herd immunity.
p337
aVSo, if we have a population of a thousand people,
p338
aVand we want to make the population immune to a pathogen,
p339
aVwe don't have to immunize every single person.
p340
aVIf we immunize 960 of them,
p341
aVit's as if we had immunized a hundred [percent] of them.
p342
aVBecause even if one or two of the non-immune people gets infected,
p343
aVthere's no one for them to infect.
p344
aVThey are surrounded by immunized people.
p345
aVSo 96 percent is as good as 100 percent.
p346
aVWell, some other scientists have estimated
p347
aVwhat would happen if you took a 30 percent random sample
p348
aVof these 1000 people, 300 people and immunized them.
p349
aVWould you get any population-level immunity?
p350
aVAnd the answer is no.
p351
aVBut if you took this 30 percent, these 300 people
p352
aVand had them nominate their friends
p353
aVand took the same number of vaccine doses
p354
aVand vaccinated the friends of the 300 \u2014
p355
aVthe 300 friends \u2014
p356
aVyou can get the same level of herd immunity
p357
aVas if you had vaccinated 96 percent of the population
p358
aVat a much greater efficiency, with a strict budget constraint.
p359
aa(lp360
VAnd similar ideas can be used, for instance,
p361
aVto target distribution of things like bed nets
p362
aVin the developing world.
p363
aVIf we could understand the structure of networks in villages,
p364
aVwe could target to whom to give the interventions
p365
aVto foster these kinds of spreads.
p366
aVOr, frankly, for advertising with all kinds of products.
p367
aVIf we could understand how to target,
p368
aVit could affect the efficiency
p369
aVof what we're trying to achieve.
p370
aVAnd in fact, we can use data
p371
aVfrom all kinds of sources nowadays [to do this].
p372
aa(lp373
VThis is a map of eight million phone users
p374
aVin a European country.
p375
aVEvery dot is a person, and every line represents
p376
aVa volume of calls between the people.
p377
aVAnd we can use such data, that's being passively obtained,
p378
aVto map these whole countries
p379
aVand understand who is located where within the network.
p380
aVWithout actually having to query them at all,
p381
aVwe can get this kind of a structural insight.
p382
aVAnd other sources of information, as you're no doubt aware
p383
aVare available about such features, from email interactions,
p384
aVonline interactions,
p385
aVonline social networks and so forth.
p386
aVAnd in fact, we are in the era of what I would call
p387
aV"massive-passive" data collection efforts.
p388
aVThey're all kinds of ways we can use massively collected data
p389
aVto create sensor networks
p390
aVto follow the population,
p391
aVunderstand what's happening in the population,
p392
aVand intervene in the population for the better.
p393
aVBecause these new technologies tell us
p394
aVnot just who is talking to whom,
p395
aVbut where everyone is,
p396
aVand what they're thinking based on what they're uploading on the Internet,
p397
aVand what they're buying based on their purchases.
p398
aVAnd all this administrative data can be pulled together
p399
aVand processed to understand human behavior
p400
aVin a way we never could before.
p401
aa(lp402
VSo, for example, we could use truckers' purchases of fuel.
p403
aVSo the truckers are just going about their business,
p404
aVand they're buying fuel.
p405
aVAnd we see a blip up in the truckers' purchases of fuel,
p406
aVand we know that a recession is about to end.
p407
aVOr we can monitor the velocity
p408
aVwith which people are moving with their phones on a highway,
p409
aVand the phone company can see,
p410
aVas the velocity is slowing down,
p411
aVthat there's a traffic jam.
p412
aVAnd they can feed that information back to their subscribers,
p413
aVbut only to their subscribers on the same highway
p414
aVlocated behind the traffic jam!
p415
aVOr we can monitor doctors prescribing behaviors, passively,
p416
aVand see how the diffusion of innovation with pharmaceuticals
p417
aVoccurs within [networks of] doctors.
p418
aVOr again, we can monitor purchasing behavior in people
p419
aVand watch how these types of phenomena
p420
aVcan diffuse within human populations.
p421
aa(lp422
VAnd there are three ways, I think,
p423
aVthat these massive-passive data can be used.
p424
aVOne is fully passive,
p425
aVlike I just described \u2014
p426
aVas in, for instance, the trucker example,
p427
aVwhere we don't actually intervene in the population in any way.
p428
aVOne is quasi-active,
p429
aVlike the flu example I gave,
p430
aVwhere we get some people to nominate their friends
p431
aVand then passively monitor their friends \u2014
p432
aVdo they have the flu, or not? \u2014 and then get warning.
p433
aVOr another example would be,
p434
aVif you're a phone company, you figure out who's central in the network
p435
aVand you ask those people, "Look, will you just text us your fever every day?
p436
aVJust text us your temperature."
p437
aVAnd collect vast amounts of information about people's temperature,
p438
aVbut from centrally located individuals.
p439
aVAnd be able, on a large scale,
p440

aVOr, finally, it can be more fully active \u2014

aVas I know subsequent speakers will also talk about today \u2014
p444
aVwhere people might globally participate in wikis,

VIn fact, the availability of these data, I think,
p451
aVheralds a kind of new era
p452
aVof what I and others would like to call

aV"computational social science."
p454
aVIt's sort of like when Galileo invented \u2014 or, didn't invent \u2014

p461
aVthat allow us to understand social processes

aVAnd actually, we can use these insights
p469
aVto improve society and improve human well-being.
