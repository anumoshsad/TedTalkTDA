VA few years ago,
p4
aVmy mom developed rheumatoid arthritis.
p5
aVHer wrists, knees and toes swelled up, causing crippling, chronic pain.
p6
aVShe had to file for disability.
p7
aVShe stopped attending our local mosque.
p8
aVSome mornings it was too painful for her to brush her teeth.
p9
aVI wanted to help.
p10
aVBut I didn't know how.
p11
aVI'm not a doctor.
p12
aa(lp13
VSo, what I am is a historian of medicine.
p14
aVSo I started to research the history of chronic pain.
p15
aVTurns out, UCLA has an entire history of pain collection
p16
aVin their archives.
p17
aVAnd I found a story \u2014 a fantastic story \u2014
p18
aVof a man who saved \u2014 rescued \u2014 millions of people from pain;
p19
aVpeople like my mom.
p20
aVYet, I had never heard of him.
p21
aVThere were no biographies of him, no Hollywood movies.
p22
aVHis name was John J. Bonica.
p23
aVBut when our story begins,
p24
aVhe was better known as Johnny "Bull" Walker.
p25
aa(lp26
VIt was a summer day in 1941.
p27
aVThe circus had just arrived in the tiny town of Brookfield, New York.
p28
aVSpectators flocked to see the wire-walkers, the tramp clowns \u2014
p29
aVif they were lucky, the human cannonball.
p30
aVThey also came to see the strongman, Johnny "Bull" Walker,
p31
aVa brawny bully who'd pin you for a dollar.
p32
aVYou know, on that particular day, a voice rang out
p33
aVover the circus P.A. system.
p34
aVThey needed a doctor urgently, in the live animal tent.
p35
aVSomething had gone wrong with the lion tamer.
p36
aVThe climax of his act had gone wrong,
p37
aVand his head was stuck inside the lion's mouth.
p38
aVHe was running out of air;
p39
aVthe crowd watched in horror
p40
aVas he struggled and then passed out.
p41
aVWhen the lion finally did relax its jaws,
p42
aVthe lion tamer just slumped to the ground, motionless.
p43
aVWhen he came to a few minutes later,
p44
aVhe saw a familiar figure hunched over him.
p45
aVIt was Bull Walker.
p46
aVThe strongman had given the lion tamer mouth-to-mouth, and saved his life.
p47
aa(lp48
VNow, the strongman hadn't told anyone,
p49
aVbut he was actually a third-year medical student.
p50
aVHe toured with the circus during summers to pay tuition,
p51
aVbut kept it a secret to protect his persona.
p52
aVHe was supposed to be a brute, a villain \u2014
p53
aVnot a nerdy do-gooder.
p54
aVHis medical colleagues didn't know his secret, either.
p55
aVAs he put it, "If you were an athlete, you were a dumb dodo."
p56
aVSo he didn't tell them about the circus,
p57
aVor about how he wrestled professionally on evenings and weekends.
p58
aVHe used a pseudonym like Bull Walker,
p59
aVor later, the Masked Marvel.
p60
aVHe even kept it a secret that same year,
p61
aVwhen he was crowned the Light Heavyweight Champion
p62
aVof the world.
p63
aa(lp64
VOver the years, John J. Bonica lived these parallel lives.
p65
aVHe was a wrestler;
p66
aVhe was a doctor.
p67
aVHe was a heel;
p68
aVhe was a hero.
p69
aVHe inflicted pain,
p70
aVand he treated it.
p71
aVAnd he didn\u2019t know it at the time, but over the next five decades,
p72
aVhe'd draw on these dueling identities
p73
aVto forge a whole new way to think about pain.
p74
aVIt'd change modern medicine so much so, that decades later,
p75
aVTime magazine would call him pain relief's founding father.
p76
aVBut that all happened later.
p77
aa(lp78
VIn 1942, Bonica graduated medical school and married Emma,
p79
aVhis sweetheart, whom he had met at one of his matches years before.
p80
aVHe still wrestled in secret \u2014 he had to.
p81
aVHis internship at New York's St. Vincent's Hospital paid nothing.
p82
aVWith his championship belt, he wrestled in big-ticket venues,
p83
aVlike Madison Square Garden,
p84
aVagainst big-time opponents,
p85
aVlike Everett "The Blonde Bear" Marshall,
p86
aVor three-time world champion, Angelo Savoldi.
p87
aa(lp88
VThe matches took a toll on his body;
p89
aVhe tore hip joints, fractured ribs.
p90
aVOne night, The Terrible Turk's big toe scratched a scar like Capone's
p91
aVdown the side of his face.
p92
aVThe next morning at work, he had to wear a surgical mask to hide it.
p93
aVTwice Bonica showed up to the O.R. with one eye so bruised,
p94
aVhe couldn't see out of it.
p95
aVBut worst of all were his mangled cauliflower ears.
p96
aVHe said they felt like two baseballs on the sides of his head.
p97
aVPain just kept accumulating in his life.
p98
aa(lp99
VNext, he watched his wife go into labor at his hospital.
p100
aVShe heaved and pushed, clearly in anguish.
p101
aVHer obstetrician called out to the intern on duty
p102
aVto give her a few drops of ether to ease her pain.
p103
aVBut the intern was a young guy, just three weeks on the job \u2014
p104
aVhe was jittery, and in applying the ether,
p105
aVirritated Emma's throat.
p106
aVShe vomited and choked, and started to turn blue.
p107
aVBonica, who was watching all this, pushed the intern out of the way,
p108
aVcleared her airway,
p109
aVand saved his wife and his unborn daughter.
p110
aVAt that moment, he decided to devote his life to anesthesiology.
p111
aVLater, he'd even go on to help develop the epidural, for delivering mothers.
p112
aVBut before he could focus on obstetrics,
p113
aVBonica had to report for basic training.
p114
aa(lp115
VRight around D-Day,
p116
aVBonica showed up to Madigan Army Medical Center,
p117
aVnear Tacoma.
p118
aVAt 7,700 beds, it was one of the largest army hospitals in America.
p119
aVBonica was in charge of all pain control there.
p120
aVHe was only 27.
p121
aVTreating so many patients, Bonica started noticing cases
p122
aVthat contradicted everything he had learned.
p123
aVPain was supposed to be a kind of alarm bell \u2014 in a good way \u2014
p124
aVa body's way of signaling an injury, like a broken arm.
p125
aVBut in some cases,
p126
aVlike after a patient had a leg amputated,
p127
aVthat patient might still complain of pain in that nonexistent leg.
p128
aVBut if the injury had been treated, why would the alarm bell keep ringing?
p129
aVThere were other cases in which there was no evidence of an injury whatsoever,
p130
aVand yet, still the patient hurt.
p131
aa(lp132
VBonica tracked down all the specialists at his hospital \u2014 surgeons,
p133
aVneurologists, psychiatrists, others.
p134
aVAnd he tried to get their opinions on his patients.
p135
aVIt took too long, so he started organizing group meetings over lunch.
p136
aVIt would be like a tag team of specialists going up against the patient's pain.
p137
aVNo one had ever focused on pain this way before.
p138
aa(lp139
VAfter that, he hit the books.
p140
aVHe read every medical textbook he could get his hands on,
p141
aVcarefully noting every mention of the word "pain."
p142
aVOut of the 14,000 pages he read,
p143
aVthe word "pain" was on 17 and a half of them.
p144
aVSeventeen and a half.
p145
aVFor the most basic, most common, most frustrating part of being a patient.
p146
aVBonica was shocked \u2014 I'm quoting him,
p147
aVhe said, "What the hell kind of conclusion can you come to there?
p148
aVThe most important thing from the patient's perspective,
p149
aVthey don't talk about."
p150
aa(lp151
VSo over the next eight years, Bonica would talk about it.
p152
aVHe'd write about it; he'd write those missing pages.
p153
aVHe wrote what would later be known as the Bible of Pain.
p154
aVIn it he proposed new strategies,
p155
aVnew treatments using nerve-block injections.
p156
aVHe proposed a new institution, the Pain Clinic,
p157
aVbased on those lunchtime meetings.
p158
aVBut the most important thing about his book
p159
aVwas that it was kind of an emotional alarm bell for medicine.
p160
aVA desperate plea to doctors to take pain seriously
p161
aVin patients' lives.
p162
aVHe recast the very purpose of medicine.
p163
aVThe goal wasn't to make patients better;
p164
aVit was to make patients feel better.
p165
aVHe pushed his pain agenda for decades,
p166
aVbefore it finally took hold in the mid-'70s.
p167
aVHundreds of pain clinics sprung up all over the world.
p168
aa(lp169
VBut as they did \u2014 a tragic twist.
p170
aVBonica's years of wrestling caught up to him.
p171
aVHe had been out of the ring for over 20 years,
p172
aVbut those 1,500 professional bouts had left a mark on his body.
p173
aVStill in his mid-50s, he suffered severe osteoarthritis.
p174
aVOver the next 20 years he'd have 22 surgeries,
p175
aVincluding four spine operations,
p176
aVand hip replacement after hip replacement.
p177
aVHe could barely raise his arm, turn his neck.
p178
aVHe needed aluminum crutches to walk.
p179
aVHis friends and former students became his doctors.
p180
aVOne recalled that he probably had more nerve-block injections
p181
aVthan anyone else on the planet.
p182
aVAlready a workaholic, he worked even more \u2014
p183
aV15- to 18-hour days.
p184
aVHealing others became more than just his job,
p185
aVit was his own most effective form of relief.
p186
aV"If I wasn't as busy as I am," he told a reporter at the time,
p187
aV"I would be a completely disabled guy."
p188
aa(lp189
VOn a business trip to Florida in the early 1980s,
p190
aVBonica got a former student to drive him to the Hyde Park area in Tampa.
p191
aVThey drove past palm trees and pulled up to an old mansion,
p192
aVwith giant silver howitzer cannons hidden in the garage.
p193
aVThe house belonged to the Zacchini family,
p194
aVwho were something like American circus royalty.
p195
aVDecades earlier, Bonica had watched them,
p196
aVclad in silver jumpsuits and goggles,
p197
aVdoing the act they pioneered \u2014 the Human Cannonball.
p198
aVBut now they were like him: retired.
p199
aVThat generation is all dead now, including Bonica,
p200
aVso there's no way to know exactly what they said that day.
p201
aVBut still, I love imagining it.
p202
aVThe strongman and the human cannonballs reunited,
p203
aVshowing off old scars, and new ones.
p204
aVMaybe Bonica gave them medical advice.
p205
aVMaybe he told them what he later said in an oral history,
p206
aVwhich is that his time in the circus and wrestling deeply molded his life.
p207
aa(lp208
VBonica saw pain close up.
p209
aVHe felt it. He lived it.
p210
aVAnd it made it impossible for him to ignore in others.
p211
aVOut of that empathy, he spun a whole new field,
p212
aVplayed a major role in getting medicine to acknowledge pain
p213
aVin and of itself.
p214
aa(lp215
VIn that same oral history,
p216
aVBonica claimed that pain
p217
aVis the most complex human experience.
p218
aVThat it involves your past life, your current life,
p219
aVyour interactions, your family.
p220
aVThat was definitely true for Bonica.
p221
aa(lp222
VBut it was also true for my mom.
p223
aVIt's easy for doctors to see my mom
p224
aVas a kind of professional patient,
p225
aVa woman who just spends her days in waiting rooms.
p226
aVSometimes I get stuck seeing her that same way.
p227
aVBut as I saw Bonica's pain \u2014
p228
aVa testament to his fully lived life \u2014
p229
aVI started to remember all the things that my mom's pain holds.
p230
aVBefore they got swollen and arthritic,
p231
aVmy mom's fingers clacked away
p232
aVin the hospital H.R. department where she worked.
p233
aVThey folded samosas for our entire mosque.
p234
aVWhen I was a kid, they cut my hair,
p235
aVwiped my nose,
p236
aVtied my shoes.
