VGood morning!
p4
aVAre you awake?
p5
aVThey took my name tag, but I wanted to ask you,
p6
aVdid anyone here write their name on the tag in Arabic?
p7
aVAnyone! No one? All right, no problem.
p8
aa(lp9
VOnce upon a time, not long ago,
p10
aVI was sitting in a restaurant with my friend, ordering food.
p11
aVSo I looked at the waiter and said,
p12
aV"Do you have a menu (Arabic)?"
p13
aVHe looked at me strangely, thinking that he misheard.
p14
aVHe said, "Sorry? (English)."
p15
aVI said, "The menu (Arabic), please."
p16
aVHe replied, "Don't you know what they call it?"
p17
aV"I do."
p18
aVHe said, "No! It's called "menu" (English), or "menu" (French)."
p19
aVIs the French pronunciation correct?
p20
aV"Come, come, take care of this one!" said the waiter.
p21
aVHe was disgusted when talking to me, as if he was saying to himself,
p22
aV"If this was the last girl on Earth, I wouldn't look at her!"
p23
aVWhat's the meaning of saying "menu" in Arabic?
p24
aVTwo words made a Lebanese young man judge a girl as being backward
p25
aVand ignorant.
p26
aVHow could she speak that way?
p27
aa(lp28
VAt that moment, I started thinking.
p29
aVIt made me mad.
p30
aVIt definitely hurts!
p31
aVI'm denied the right to speak my own language in my own country?
p32
aVWhere could this happen?
p33
aVHow did we get here?
p34
aa(lp35
VWell, while we are here, there are many people like me,
p36
aVwho would reach a stage in their lives, where they involuntarily give up
p37
aVeverything that has happened to them in the past,
p38
aVjust so they can say that they're modern
p39
aVand civilized.
p40
aVShould I forget all my culture, thoughts,
p41
aVintellect and all my memories?
p42
aVChildhood stories might be the best memories we have of the war!
p43
aVShould I forget everything I learned in Arabic, just to conform?
p44
aVTo be one of them?
p45
aVWhere's the logic in that?
p46
aVDespite all that, I tried to understand him.
p47
aVI didn't want to judge him with the same cruelty that he judged me.
p48
aa(lp49
VThe Arabic language doesn't satisfy today's needs.
p50
aVIt's not a language for science,
p51
aVresearch,
p52
aVa language we're used to in universities,
p53
aVa language we use in the workplace,
p54
aVa language we rely on if we were to perform an advanced research project,
p55
aVand it definitely isn't a language we use at the airport.
p56
aVIf we did so, they'd strip us of our clothes.
p57
aVWhere can I use it, then? We could all ask this question!
p58
aVSo, you want us to use Arabic. Where are we to do so?
p59
aVThis is one reality.
p60
aa(lp61
VBut we have another more important reality that we ought to think about.
p62
aVArabic is the mother tongue.
p63
aVResearch says that mastery of other languages
p64
aVdemands mastery of the mother tongue.
p65
aVMastery of the mother tongue is a prerequisite for creative expression in other languages.
p66
aa(lp67
VHow?
p68
aVGibran Khalil Gibran,
p69
aVwhen he first started writing, he used Arabic.
p70
aVAll his ideas, imagination and philosophy
p71
aVwere inspired by this little boy in the village
p72
aVwhere he grew up, smelling a specific smell,
p73
aVhearing a specific voice,
p74
aVand thinking a specific thought.
p75
aVSo, when he started writing in English, he had enough baggage.
p76
aVEven when he wrote in English,
p77
aVwhen you read his writings in English, you smell the same smell,
p78
aVsense the same feeling.
p79
aVYou can imagine that that's him writing in English,
p80
aVthe same boy who came from the mountain. From a village on Mount Lebanon.
p81
aVSo, this is an example no one can argue with.
p82
aa(lp83
VSecond, it's often said that if you want to kill a nation,
p84
aVthe only way to kill a nation,
p85
aVis to kill its language.
p86
aVThis is a reality that developed societies are aware of.
p87
aVThe Germans, French, Japanese and Chinese, all these nations are aware of this.
p88
aVThat's why they legislate to protect their language.
p89
aVThey make it sacred.
p90
aVThat's why they use it in production, they pay a lot of money to develop it.
p91
aVDo we know better than them?
p92
aa(lp93
VAll right,
p94
aVwe aren't from the developed world,
p95
aVthis advanced thinking hasn't reached us yet,
p96
aVand we would like to catch up with the civilized world.
p97
aVCountries that were once like us, but decided to strive for development,
p98
aVdo research,
p99
aVand catch up with those countries,
p100
aVsuch as Turkey, Malaysia and others,
p101
aVthey carried their language with them as they were climbing the ladder,
p102
aVprotected it like a diamond.
p103
aVThey kept it close to them.
p104
aVBecause if you get any product from Turkey or elsewhere
p105
aVand it's not labeled in Turkish,
p106
aVthen it isn't a local product.
p107
aVYou wouldn't believe it's a local product.
p108
aVThey'd go back to being consumers,
p109
aVclueless consumers, like we are most of the time.
p110
aVSo, in order for them to innovate and produce, they had to protect their language.
p111
aVIf I say, "Freedom, sovereignty, independence (Arabic),"
p112
aVwhat does this remind you of?
p113
aVIt doesn't ring a bell, does it?
p114
aVRegardless of the who, how and why.
p115
aa(lp116
VLanguage isn't just for conversing, just words coming out of our mouths.
p117
aVLanguage represents specific stages in our lives,
p118
aVand terminology that is linked to our emotions.
p119
aVSo when we say, "Freedom, sovereignty, independence,"
p120
aVeach one of you draws a specific image in their own mind,
p121
aVthere are specific feelings
p122
aVof a specific day in a specific historical period.
p123
aa(lp124
VLanguage isn't one, two or three words or letters put together.
p125
aVIt's an idea inside that relates to how we think,
p126
aVand how we see each other and how others see us.
p127
aVWhat is our intellect?
p128
aVHow do you say whether this guy understands or not?
p129
aVSo, if I say, "Freedom, sovereignty, independence (English),"
p130
aVor if your son came up to you and said,
p131
aV"Dad, have you lived through the period of the freedom (English) slogan?"
p132
aVHow would you feel?
p133
aVIf you don't see a problem,
p134
aVthen I'd better leave, and stop talking in vain.
p135
aa(lp136
VThe idea is that these expressions remind us of a specific thing.
p137
aVI have a francophone friend who's married to a French man.
p138
aVI asked her once how things were going.
p139
aVShe said, "Everything is fine,
p140
aVbut once, I spent a whole night asking and trying to translate
p141
aVthe meaning of the word 'toqborni' for him."
p142
aV(Laughter)
p143
aV(Applause)
p144
aVThe poor woman had mistakenly told him "toqborni,"
p145
aVand then spent the whole night trying to explain it to him.
p146
aVHe was puzzled by the thought: "How could anyone be this cruel?
p147
aVDoes she want to commit suicide?
p148
aV'Bury me?' (English)"
p149
aVThis is one of the few examples.
p150
aa(lp151
VIt made us feel that she's unable to tell that word to her husband,
p152
aVsince he won't understand,
p153
aVand he's right not to; his way of thinking is different.
p154
aVShe said to me, "He listens to Fairuz with me,
p155
aVand one night, I tried to translate for him
p156
aVso he can feel what I feel when I listen to Fairuz."
p157
aVThe poor woman tried to translate this for him:
p158
aV"From them I extended my hands and stole you \u2014"
p159
aV(Laughter)
p160
aVAnd here's the pickle:
p161
aV"And because you belong to them, I returned my hands and left you."
p162
aV(Laughter)
p163
aVTranslate that for me.
p164
aV(Applause)
p165
aa(lp166
VSo, what have we done to protect the Arabic language?
p167
aVWe turned this into a concern of the civil society,
p168
aVand we launched a campaign to preserve the Arabic language.
p169
aVEven though many people told me, "Why do you bother?
p170
aVForget about this headache and go have fun."
p171
aVNo problem!
p172
aVThe campaign to preserve Arabic launched a slogan that says,
p173
aV"I talk to you from the East, but you reply from the West."
p174
aVWe didn't say, "No! We do not accept this or that."
p175
aVWe didn't adopt this style because that way, we wouldn't be understood.
p176
aVAnd when someone talks to me that way, I hate the Arabic language.
p177
aVWe say\u2014
p178
aV(Applause)
p179
aa(lp180
VWe want to change our reality,
p181
aVand be convinced in a way that reflects our dreams, aspirations and day-to-day life.
p182
aVIn a way that dresses like us and thinks like we do.
p183
aVSo, "I talk to you from the East, but you reply from the West"
p184
aVhas hit the spot.
p185
aVSomething very easy, yet creative and persuasive.
p186
aVAfter that, we launched another campaign
p187
aVwith scenes of letters on the ground.
p188
aVYou've seen an example of it outside,
p189
aVa scene of a letter surrounded by black and yellow tape
p190
aVwith "Don't kill your language!" written on it.
p191
aVWhy? Seriously, don't kill your language.
p192
aVWe really shouldn't kill our language.
p193
aVIf we were to kill the language, we'd have to find an identity.
p194
aa(lp195
VWe'd have to find an existence.
p196
aVWe'd go back to the beginning.
p197
aVThis is beyond just missing our chance of being modern and civilized.
p198
aa(lp199
VAfter that we released photos of guys and girls wearing the Arabic letter.
p200
aVPhotos of "cool" guys and girls.
p201
aVWe are very cool!
p202
aVAnd to whoever might say, "Ha! You used an English word!"
p203
aVI say, "No! I adopt the word 'cool.'"
p204
aVLet them object however they want, but give me a word that's nicer
p205
aVand matches the reality better.
p206
aVI will keep on saying "Internet"
p207
aVI wouldn't say: "I'm going to the world wide web"
p208
aV(Laughs)
p209
aVBecause it doesn't fit! We shouldn't kid ourselves.
p210
aVBut to reach this point, we all have to be convinced
p211
aVthat we shouldn't allow anyone who is bigger
p212
aVor thinks they have any authority over us when it comes to language,
p213
aVto control us or make us think and feel what they want.
p214
aa(lp215
VCreativity is the idea.
p216
aVSo, if we can't reach space or build a rocket and so on,
p217
aVwe can be creative.
p218
aVAt this moment, every one of you is a creative project.
p219
aVCreativity in your mother tongue is the path.
p220
aVLet's start from this moment.
p221
aVLet's write a novel or produce a short film.
p222
aVA single novel could make us global again.
p223
aVIt could bring the Arabic language back to being number one.
p224
aVSo, it's not true that there's no solution; there is a solution!
p225
aVBut we have to know that, and be convinced that a solution exists,
p226
aVthat we have a duty to be part of that solution.
p227
aa(lp228
VIn conclusion, what can you do today?
p229
aVNow, tweets, who's tweeting?
p230
aVPlease, I beg of you, even though my time has finished,
p231
aVeither Arabic, English, French or Chinese.
p232
aVBut don't write Arabic with Latin characters mixed with numbers!
p233
aV(Applause)
p234
aVIt's a disaster! That's not a language.
p235
aVYou'd be entering a virtual world with a virtual language.
p236
aVIt's not easy to come back from such a place and rise.
p237
aVThat's the first thing we can do.
p238
aa(lp239
VSecond, there are many other things that we can do.
p240
aVWe're not here today to convince each other.
p241
aVWe're here to bring attention to the necessity of preserving this language.
p242
aVNow I will tell you a secret.
p243
aVA baby first identifies its father
p244
aVthrough language.
p245
aVWhen my daughter is born, I'll tell her, "This is your father, honey (Arabic)."
p246
aVI wouldn't say, "This is your dad, honey (English)."
p247
aVAnd in the supermarket, I promise my daughter Noor,
p248
aVthat if she says to me, "Thanks (Arabic),"
p249
aVI won't say, "Dis, 'Merci, Maman,'" and hope no one has heard her.
p250
aV(Applause)
p251
aa(lp252
VLet's get rid of this cultural cringe.
