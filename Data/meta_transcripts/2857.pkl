VSo, my mother's a pediatrician,
p4
aVand when I was young, she'd tell the craziest stories
p5
aVthat combined science with her overactive imagination.
p6
aVOne of the stories she told was that if you eat a lot of salt,
p7
aVall of the blood rushes up your legs,
p8
aVthrough your body,
p9
aVand shoots out the top of your head,
p10
aVkilling you instantly.
p11
aa(lp12
V(Laughter)
p13
aa(lp14
VShe called it "high blood pressure."
p15
aa(lp16
V(Laughter)
p17
aa(lp18
VThis was my first experience with science fiction,
p19
aVand I loved it.
p20
aVSo when I started to write my own science fiction and fantasy,
p21
aVI was surprised that it was considered un-African.
p22
aVSo naturally, I asked, what is African?
p23
aVAnd this is what I know so far:
p24
aVAfrica is important.
p25
aVAfrica is the future.
p26
aVIt is, though.
p27
aVAnd Africa is a serious place where only serious things happen.
p28
aa(lp29
VSo when I present my work somewhere, someone will always ask,
p30
aV"What's so important about it?
p31
aVHow does it deal with real African issues
p32
aVlike war, poverty, devastation or AIDS?"
p33
aVAnd it doesn't.
p34
aVMy work is about Nairobi pop bands that want to go to space
p35
aVor about seven-foot-tall robots
p36
aVthat fall in love.
p37
aVIt's nothing incredibly important.
p38
aVIt's just fun, fierce and frivolous,
p39
aVas frivolous as bubble gum \u2014
p40
aV"AfroBubbleGum."
p41
aa(lp42
VSo I'm not saying that agenda art isn't important;
p43
aVI'm the chairperson of a charity
p44
aVthat deals with films and theaters that write about HIV and radicalization
p45
aVand female genital mutilation.
p46
aVIt's vital and important art,
p47
aVbut it cannot be the only art that comes out of the continent.
p48
aVWe have to tell more stories
p49
aVthat are vibrant.
p50
aVThe danger of the single story is still being realized.
p51
aVAnd maybe it's because of the funding.
p52
aVA lot of art is still dependent on developmental aid.
p53
aVSo art becomes a tool for agenda.
p54
aVOr maybe it's because we've only seen one image of ourselves for so long
p55
aVthat that's all we know how to create.
p56
aVWhatever the reason, we need a new way,
p57
aVand AfroBubbleGum is one approach.
p58
aVIt's the advocacy of art for art's sake.
p59
aVIt's the advocacy of art that is not policy-driven
p60
aVor agenda-driven
p61
aVor based on education,
p62
aVjust for the sake of imagination:
p63
aVAfroBubbleGum art.
p64
aa(lp65
VAnd we can't all be AfroBubbleGumists.
p66
aVWe have to judge our work for its potential poverty porn pitfalls.
p67
aVWe have to have tests that are similar to the Bechdel test,
p68
aVand ask questions like:
p69
aVAre two or more Africans in this piece of fiction healthy?
p70
aVAre those same Africans financially stable and not in need of saving?
p71
aVAre they having fun and enjoying life?
p72
aVAnd if we can answer yes to two or more of these questions,
p73
aVthen surely we're AfroBubbleGumists.
p74
aa(lp75
V(Laughter)
p76
aa(lp77
V(Applause)
p78
aa(lp79
VAnd fun is political,
p80
aVbecause imagine if we have images of Africans who were vibrant
p81
aVand loving and thriving
p82
aVand living a beautiful, vibrant life.
p83
aVWhat would we think of ourselves then?
p84
aVWould we think that maybe we're worthy of more happiness?
p85
aVWould we think of our shared humanity through our shared joy?
p86
aVI think of these things when I create.
p87
aVI think of the people and the places that give me immeasurable joy,
p88
aVand I work to represent them.
p89
aVAnd that's why I write stories
p90
aVabout futuristic girls that risk everything to save plants
p91
aVor to race camels
p92
aVor even just to dance,
p93
aVto honor fun,
p94
aVbecause my world is mostly happy.
p95
aa(lp96
VAnd I know happiness is a privilege in this current splintered world
p97
aVwhere remaining hopeful requires diligence.
p98
aVBut maybe, if you join me in creating, curating and commissioning
p99
aVmore AfroBubbleGum art,
p100
aVthere might be hope for a different view of the world,
p101
aVa happy Africa view
p102
aVwhere children are strangely traumatized
p103
aVby their mother's dark sense of humor,
p104
aa(lp105
V(Laughter)
p106
aa(lp107
Vbut also they're claiming fun, fierce and frivolous art
p108
aVin the name of all things unseriously African.
p109
aVBecause we're AfroBubbleGumists
p110
aVand there's so many more of us than you can imagine.
p111
aa(lp112
VThank you so much.
