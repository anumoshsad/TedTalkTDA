VI should tell you that when I was asked to be here,
p4
aVI thought to myself that well, it's TED.
p5
aVAnd these TEDsters are \u2014 you know, as innocent as that name sounds \u2014
p6
aVthese are the philanthropists and artists and scientists who sort of shape our world.
p7
aVAnd what could I possibly have to say that would be distinguished enough
p8
aVto justify my participation in something like that?
p9
aVAnd so I thought perhaps a really civilized-sounding British accent
p10
aVmight help things a bit.
p11
aa(lp12
VAnd then I thought no, no. I should just get up there and be myself
p13
aVand just talk the way I really talk
p14
aVbecause, after all, this is the great unveiling.
p15
aVAnd so I thought I'd come up here and unveil my real voice to you.
p16
aVAlthough many of you already know that I do speak the Queen's English
p17
aVbecause I am from Queens, New York.
p18
aV(Laughter)
p19
aVBut the theme of this session, of course, is invention.
p20
aVAnd while I don't have any patents that I'm aware of,
p21
aVyou will be meeting a few of my inventions today.
p22
aVI suppose it's fair to say
p23
aVthat I am interested in the invention of self or selves.
p24
aVWe're all born into certain circumstances with particular physical traits,
p25
aVunique developmental experiences, geographical and historical contexts.
p26
aVBut then what?
p27
aVTo what extent do we self-construct, do we self-invent?
p28
aVHow do we self-identify and how mutable is that identity?
p29
aVLike, what if one could be anyone at any time?
p30
aVWell my characters, like the ones in my shows,
p31
aVallow me to play with the spaces between those questions.
p32
aVAnd so I've brought a couple of them with me.
p33
aVAnd well, they're very excited.
p34
aVWhat I should tell you \u2014
p35
aVwhat I should tell you is that they've each prepared their own little TED talks.
p36
aVSo feel free to think of this as Sarah University.
p37
aV(Laughter)
p38
aa(lp39
VOkay. Okay. Oh, well.
p40
aVOh, wonderful.
p41
aVGood evening everybody.
p42
aVThank you so very much for having me here today.
p43
aVAh, thank you very much. My name is Lorraine Levine.
p44
aVOh my! There's so many of you.
p45
aVHi sweetheart. Okay.
p46
aV(Laughter)
p47
aVAnyway, I am here because of a young girl, Sarah Jones.
p48
aVShe's a very nice, young black girl.
p49
aVWell you know, she calls herself black \u2014
p50
aVshe's really more like a caramel color if you look at her.
p51
aVBut anyway.
p52
aV(Laughter)
p53
aVShe has me here because she puts me in her show,
p54
aVwhat she calls her one-woman show.
p55
aVAnd you know what that means, of course.
p56
aVThat means she takes the credit and then makes us come out here and do all the work.
p57
aVBut I don't mind.
p58
aa(lp59
VFrankly, I'm kvelling just to be here
p60
aVwith all the luminaries you have attending something like this, you know.
p61
aVReally, it's amazing.
p62
aVNot only, of course, the scientists and all the wonderful giants of the industries
p63
aVbut the celebrities.
p64
aVThere are so many celebrities running around here.
p65
aVI saw \u2014 Glenn Close I saw earlier. I love her.
p66
aVAnd she was getting a yogurt in the Google cafe.
p67
aVIsn't that adorable?
p68
aV(Laughter)
p69
aVSo many others you see, they're just wonderful.
p70
aVIt's lovely to know they're concerned, you know.
p71
aVAnd \u2014 oh, I saw Goldie Hawn.
p72
aVOh, Goldie Hawn. I love her, too; she's wonderful. Yeah.
p73
aVYou know, she's only half Jewish.
p74
aVDid you know that about her?
p75
aVYeah. But even so, a wonderful talent. (Laughter)
p76
aVAnd I \u2014 you know, when I saw her, such a wonderful feeling.
p77
aVYeah, she's lovely.
p78
aVBut anyway, I should have started by saying just how lucky I feel.
p79
aVIt's such an eye-opening experience to be here.
p80
aVYou're all so responsible for this world that we live in today.
p81
aVYou know, I couldn't have dreamed of such a thing as a young girl.
p82
aVAnd you've all made these advancements happen in such a short time \u2014
p83
aVyou're all so young.
p84
aVYou know, your parents must be very proud.
p85
aa(lp86
VBut I \u2014 I also appreciate the diversity that you have here.
p87
aVI noticed it's very multicultural.
p88
aVYou know, when you're standing up here, you can see all the different people.
p89
aVIt's like a rainbow.
p90
aVIt's okay to say rainbow. Yeah.
p91
aVI just \u2014 I can't keep up with whether you can say, you know, the different things.
p92
aVWhat are you allowed to say or not say?
p93
aVI just \u2014 I don't want to offend anybody. You know.
p94
aVBut anyway, you know,
p95
aVI just think that to be here with all of you
p96
aVaccomplished young people \u2014
p97
aVliterally, some of you, the architects building our brighter future.
p98
aVYou know, it's heartening to me.
p99
aVEven though, quite frankly, some of your presentations are horrifying,
p100
aVabsolutely horrifying.
p101
aVIt's true. It's true.
p102
aVYou know, between the environmental degradation
p103
aVand the crashing of the world markets you're talking about.
p104
aVAnd of course, we know it's all because of the \u2014 all the ...
p105
aVWell, I don't know how else to say it to you, so I'll just say it my way:
p106
aVthe ganeyvish schticklich coming from the governments and the, you know,
p107
aVthe bankers and the Wall Street. You know it.
p108
aVAnyway.
p109
aV(Laughter)
p110
aa(lp111
VThe point is, I'm happy somebody has practical ideas
p112
aVto get us out of this mess.
p113
aVSo I salute each of you and your stellar achievements.
p114
aVThank you for all that you do.
p115
aVAnd congratulations on being such big makhers that you've become TED meisters.
p116
aVSo, happy continued success.
p117
aVCongratulations. Mazel tov.
p118
aV(Applause)
p119
aa(lp120
VHi. Hi.
p121
aVThank you everybody.
p122
aVSorry, this is such a wonderful opportunity and everything, to be here right now.
p123
aVMy name is Noraida. And I'm just \u2014
p124
aVI'm so thrilled to be part of like your TED conference
p125
aVthat you're doing and everything like that.
p126
aVI am Dominican-American.
p127
aVActually, you could say I grew up in the capital of Dominican Republic,
p128
aVotherwise known as Washington Heights in New York City.
p129
aVBut I don't know if there's any other Dominican people here,
p130
aVbut I know that Juan Enriquez, he was here yesterday.
p131
aVAnd I think he's Mexican, so that's \u2014
p132
aVhonestly, that's close enough for me right now. So \u2014
p133
aV(Laughter)
p134
aa(lp135
VI just \u2014 I'm sorry.
p136
aVI'm just trying not to be nervous because this is
p137
aVa very wonderful experience for me and everything.
p138
aVAnd I just \u2014 you know I'm not used to doing the public speaking.
p139
aVAnd whenever I get nervous I start to talk really fast.
p140
aVNobody can understand nothing I'm saying, which is very frustrating for me,
p141
aVas you can imagine.
p142
aVI usually have to just like try to calm down and take a deep breath.
p143
aVBut then on top of that, you know, Sarah Jones told me we only have 18 minutes.
p144
aVSo then I'm like, should I be nervous, you know, because maybe it's better.
p145
aVAnd I'm just trying not to panic and freak out. So I like, take a deep breath.
p146
aa(lp147
VOkay. Sorry. So anyway, what I was trying to say is that I really love TED.
p148
aVLike, I love everything about this. It's amazing.
p149
aVLike, it's \u2014 I can't get over this right now.
p150
aVAnd, like, people would not believe, seriously, where I'm from,
p151
aVthat this even exists.
p152
aVYou know, like even, I mean I love like the name, the \u2014 TED.
p153
aVI mean I know it's a real person and everything, but I'm just saying that like,
p154
aVyou know, I think it's very cool how it's also an acronym, you know,
p155
aVwhich is like, you know, is like very high concept and everything like that.
p156
aVI like that.
p157
aa(lp158
VAnd actually, I can relate to the whole like acronym thing and everything.
p159
aVBecause, actually, I'm a sophomore at college right now.
p160
aVAt my school \u2014 actually I was part of co-founding an organization,
p161
aVwhich is like a leadership thing,
p162
aVyou know, like you guys, you would really like it and everything.
p163
aVAnd the organization is called DA BOMB,
p164
aVA\u005cand DA BOMB \u2014 not like what you guys can build and everything \u2014
p165
aVit's like, DA BOMB, it means like Dominican \u2014 it's an acronym \u2014
p166
aVDominican-American Benevolent Organization for Mothers and Babies.
p167
aVSo, I know, see, like the name is like a little bit long,
p168
aVbut with the war on terror and everything,
p169
aVthe Dean of Student Activities has asked us to stop saying DA BOMB
p170
aVand use the whole thing so nobody would get the wrong idea, whatever.
p171
aVSo, basically like DA BOMB \u2014
p172
aVwhat Dominican-American Benevolent Organization for Mothers and Babies does
p173
aVis, basically, we try to advocate for students who show a lot of academic promise
p174
aVand who also happen to be mothers like me.
p175
aVI am a working mother, and I also go to school full-time.
p176
aVAnd, you know, it's like \u2014 it's so important to have like role models out there.
p177
aVI mean, I know sometimes our lifestyles are very different, whatever.
p178
aa(lp179
VBut like even at my job \u2014 like, I just got promoted.
p180
aVRight now it's very exciting actually for me
p181
aVbecause I'm the Junior Assistant to the Associate Director
p182
aVunder the Senior Vice President for Business Development \u2014
p183
aVthat's my new title.
p184
aVSo, but I think whether you own your own company or you're just starting out like me,
p185
aVlike something like this is so vital
p186
aVfor people to just continue expanding their minds and learning.
p187
aVAnd if everybody, like all people really had access to that,
p188
aVit would be a very different world out there, as I know you know.
p189
aVSo, I think all people, we need that,
p190
aVbut especially, I look at people like me, you know like,
p191
aVI mean, Latinos \u2014 we're about to be the majority, in like two weeks.
p192
aVSo, we deserve just as much to be part of the exchange of ideas as everybody else.
p193
aVSo, I'm very happy that you're, you know, doing this kind of thing,
p194
aVmaking the talks available online.
p195
aVThat's very good. I love that.
p196
aVAnd I just \u2014 I love you guys. I love TED.
p197
aVAnd if you don't mind, privately now, in the future, I'm going to think of TED
p198
aVas an acronym for Technology, Entertainment and Dominicans.
p199
aVThank you very much.
p200
aV(Laughter)
p201
aV(Applause)
p202
aa(lp203
VSo, that was Noraida,
p204
aVand just like Lorraine and everybody else you're meeting today,
p205
aVthese are folks who are based on real people from my real life:
p206
aVfriends, neighbors, family members.
p207
aVI come from a multicultural family.
p208
aVIn fact, the older lady you just met:
p209
aVvery, very loosely based on a great aunt on my mother's side.
p210
aVIt's a long story, believe me.
p211
aVBut on top of my family background,
p212
aVmy parents also sent me to the United Nations school,
p213
aVwhere I encountered a plethora of new characters,
p214
aVincluding Alexandre, my French teacher, okay.
p215
aa(lp216
VWell, you know, it was beginner French, that I am taking with her, you know.
p217
aVAnd it was Madame Bousson, you know, she was very [French].
p218
aVIt was like, you know, she was there in the class,
p219
aVyou know, she was kind of typically French.
p220
aVYou know, she was very chic, but she was very filled with ennui, you know.
p221
aVAnd she would be there, you know, kind of talking with the class, you know,
p222
aVtalking about the, you know, the existential futility of life, you know.
p223
aVAnd we were only 11 years old, so it was not appropriate. (Laughter)
p224
aa(lp225
VBut [German].
p226
aVYes, I took German for three years, [German],
p227
aVand it was quite the experience because I was the only black girl in the class,
p228
aVeven in the UN school.
p229
aVAlthough, you know, it was wonderful.
p230
aVThe teacher, Herr Schtopf, he never discriminated.
p231
aVNever. He always, always treated each of us,
p232
aVyou know, equally unbearably during the class.
p233
aa(lp234
VSo, there were the teachers and then there were my friends,
p235
aVclassmates from everywhere,
p236
aVmany of whom are still dear friends to this day.
p237
aVAnd they've inspired many characters as well.
p238
aVFor example, a friend of mine.
p239
aa(lp240
VWell, I just wanted to quickly say good evening.
p241
aVMy name is Praveen Manvi and thank you very much for this opportunity.
p242
aVOf course, TED, the reputation precedes itself all over the world.
p243
aVBut, you know, I am originally from India,
p244
aVand I wanted to start by telling you
p245
aVthat once Sarah Jones told me that we will be having the opportunity
p246
aVto come here to TED in California,
p247
aVoriginally, I was very pleased and, frankly, relieved
p248
aVbecause, you know, I am a human rights advocate.
p249
aVAnd usually my work, it takes me to Washington D.C.
p250
aVAnd there, I must attend these meetings, mingling with some tiresome politicians,
p251
aVtrying to make me feel comfortable
p252
aVby telling how often they are eating the curry in Georgetown. (Laughter)
p253
aVSo, you can just imagine \u2014 right.
p254
aVSo, but I'm thrilled to be joining all of you here.
p255
aVI wish we had more time together, but that's for another time. Okay? Great.
p256
aV(Applause)
p257
aa(lp258
VAnd, sadly, I don't think we'll have time for you to meet everybody I brought, but \u2014
p259
aVI'm trying to behave myself,
p260
aVit's my first time here.
p261
aVBut I do want to introduce you to a couple of folks you may recognize,
p262
aVif you saw "Bridge and Tunnel."
p263
aa(lp264
VUh, well, thank you.
p265
aVGood evening.
p266
aVMy name is Pauline Ning,
p267
aVand first I want to tell you that I'm \u2014
p268
aVof course I am a member of the Chinese community in New York.
p269
aVBut when Sarah Jones asked me to please come to TED,
p270
aVI said, well, you know, first, I don't know that, you know \u2014
p271
aVbefore two years ago, you would not find me in front of an audience of people,
p272
aVmuch less like this
p273
aVbecause I did not like to give speeches
p274
aVbecause I feel that, as an immigrant, I do not have good English skills for speaking.
p275
aVBut then, I decided, just like Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger,
p276
aVI try anyway.
p277
aV(Laughter)
p278
aVMy daughter \u2014 my daughter wrote that,
p279
aVshe told me, "Always start your speech with humor."
p280
aa(lp281
VBut my background \u2014
p282
aVI want to tell you story only briefly.
p283
aVMy husband and I, we brought our son and daughter here in 1980s
p284
aVto have the freedom we cannot have in China at that time.
p285
aVAnd we tried to teach our kids to be proud of their tradition, but it's very hard.
p286
aVYou know, as immigrant, I would speak Chinese to them,
p287
aVand they would always answer me back in English.
p288
aVThey love rock music, pop culture, American culture.
p289
aVBut when they got older,
p290
aVwhen the time comes for them to start think about getting married,
p291
aVthat's when we expect them to realize, a little bit more, their own culture.
p292
aVBut that's where we had some problems.
p293
aVMy son, he says he is not ready to get married.
p294
aVAnd he has a sweetheart, but she is American woman, not Chinese.
p295
aVIt's not that it's bad, but I told him, "What's wrong with a Chinese woman?"
p296
aVBut I think he will change his mind soon.
p297
aa(lp298
VSo, then I decide instead, I will concentrate on my daughter.
p299
aVThe daughter's marriage is very special to the mom.
p300
aVBut first, she said she's not interested.
p301
aVShe only wants to spend time with her friends.
p302
aVAnd then at college, it's like she never came home.
p303
aVAnd she doesn't want me to come and visit.
p304
aVSo I said, "What's wrong in this picture?"
p305
aVSo, I accused my daughter to have like a secret boyfriend.
p306
aVBut she told me, "Mom, you don't have to worry about boys
p307
aVbecause I don't like them."
p308
aV(Laughter)
p309
aVAnd I said, "Yes, men can be difficult, but all women have to get used to that."
p310
aVShe said, "No Mom. I mean, I don't like boys. I like girls.
p311
aVI am lesbian."
p312
aVSo, I always teach my kids to respect American ideas,
p313
aVbut I told my daughter that this is one exception \u2014
p314
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p315
aVthat she is not gay, she is just confused by this American problem.
p316
aVBut she told me, "Mom, it's not American."
p317
aVShe said she is in love \u2014 in love with a nice Chinese girl.
p318
aV(Laughter)
p319
aVSo, these are the words I am waiting to hear,
p320
aVbut from my son, not my daughter.
p321
aV(Laughter)
p322
aVBut at first I did not know what to do.
p323
aVBut then, over time, I have come to understand that this is who she is.
p324
aa(lp325
VSo, even though sometimes it's still hard,
p326
aVI will share with you that it helps me to realize
p327
aVsociety is more tolerant, usually because of places like this,
p328
aVbecause of ideas like this,
p329
aVand people like you, with an open mind.
p330
aVSo I think maybe TED, you impact people's lives
p331
aVin the ways maybe even you don't realize.
p332
aVSo, for my daughter's sake,
p333
aVI thank you for your ideas worth spreading.
p334
aVThank you. Xie xie.
p335
aV(Applause)
p336
aa(lp337
VGood evening. My name is Habbi Belahal.
p338
aVAnd I would like to first of all thank Sarah Jones
p339
aVfor putting all of the pressure on the only Arab who she brought with her
p340
aVto be last today.
p341
aVI am originally from Jordan.
p342
aVAnd I teach comparative literature at Queens College.
p343
aVIt is not Harvard.
p344
aVBut I feel a bit like a fish out of water.
p345
aVBut I am very proud of my students.
p346
aVAnd I see that a few of them did make it here to the conference.
p347
aVSo you will get the extra credit I promised you.
p348
aVBut, while I know that I may not look like the typical TED-izen, as you would say,
p349
aVI do like to make the point that we in global society,
p350
aVwe are never as different as the appearances may suggest.
p351
aa(lp352
VSo, if you will indulge me, I will share quickly with you a bit of verse,
p353
aVwhich I memorized as a young girl at 16 years of age.
p354
aVSo, back in the ancient times.
p355
aV[Arabic]
p356
aVAnd this roughly translates:
p357
aV"Please, let me hold your hand.
p358
aVI want to hold your hand.
p359
aVI want to hold your hand.
p360
aVAnd when I touch you, I feel happy inside.
p361
aVIt's such a feeling that my love, I can't hide, I can't hide, I can't hide."
p362
aVWell, so okay, but please, please, but please.
p363
aVIf it is sounding familiar, it is because I was at the same time in my life
p364
aVlistening to the Beatles.
p365
aVOn the radio [unclear], they were very popular.
p366
aa(lp367
VSo, all of that is to say that I like to believe
p368
aVthat for every word intended as to render us deaf to one another,
p369
aVthere is always a lyric connecting ears and hearts across the continents in rhyme.
p370
aVAnd I pray that this is the way that we will self-invent, in time.
p371
aVThat's all, shukran. Thank you very much for the opportunity.
p372
aVOkay? Great.
p373
aV(Applause)
p374
aa(lp375
VThank you all very much. It was lovely.
p376
aVThank you for having me.
p377
aV(Applause)
p378
aVThank you very, very much. I love you.
p379
aV(Applause)
p380
aVWell, you have to let me say this.
p381
aVI just \u2014 thank you.
p382
aVI want to thank Chris and Jacqueline, and just everyone for having me here.
p383
aVIt's been a long time coming, and I feel like I'm home.
p384
aVAnd I know I've performed for some of your companies
p385
aVor some of you have seen me elsewhere,
p386
aVbut this is honestly one of the best audiences I've ever experienced.
p387
aVThe whole thing is amazing, and so don't you all go reinventing yourselves any time soon.
