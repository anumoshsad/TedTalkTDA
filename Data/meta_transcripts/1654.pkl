VI'm here today to talk about a disturbing question,
p4
aVwhich has an equally disturbing answer.
p5
aVMy topic is the secrets of domestic violence,
p6
aVand the question I'm going to tackle
p7
aVis the one question everyone always asks:
p8
aVWhy does she stay?
p9
aVWhy would anyone stay with a man who beats her?
p10
aVI'm not a psychiatrist, a social worker
p11
aVor an expert in domestic violence.
p12
aVI'm just one woman with a story to tell.
p13
aa(lp14
VI was 22. I had just graduated from Harvard College.
p15
aVI had moved to New York City for my first job
p16
aVas a writer and editor at Seventeen magazine.
p17
aVI had my first apartment,
p18
aVmy first little green American Express card,
p19
aVand I had a very big secret.
p20
aVMy secret was that I had this gun
p21
aVloaded with hollow-point bullets pointed at my head
p22
aVby the man who I thought was my soulmate,
p23
aVmany, many times.
p24
aVThe man who I loved more than anybody on Earth
p25
aVheld a gun to my head and threatened to kill me
p26
aVmore times than I can even remember.
p27
aVI'm here to tell you the story of crazy love,
p28
aVa psychological trap disguised as love,
p29
aVone that millions of women and even a few men
p30
aVfall into every year.
p31
aVIt may even be your story.
p32
aa(lp33
VI don't look like a typical domestic violence survivor.
p34
aVI have a B.A. in English from Harvard College,
p35
aVan MBA in marketing from Wharton Business School.
p36
aVI've spent most of my career working for Fortune 500 companies
p37
aVincluding Johnson & Johnson, Leo Burnett and The Washington Post.
p38
aVI've been married for almost 20 years to my second husband
p39
aVand we have three kids together.
p40
aVMy dog is a black lab, and I drive a Honda Odyssey minivan.
p41
aV(Laughter)
p42
aa(lp43
VSo my first message for you is that domestic violence
p44
aVhappens to everyone \u2014
p45
aVall races, all religions, all income and education levels.
p46
aVIt's everywhere.
p47
aVAnd my second message is that everyone thinks
p48
aVdomestic violence happens to women,
p49
aVthat it's a women's issue.
p50
aVNot exactly.
p51
aVOver 85 percent of abusers are men, and domestic abuse
p52
aVhappens only in intimate, interdependent, long-term relationships,
p53
aVin other words, in families,
p54
aVthe last place we would want or expect to find violence,
p55
aVwhich is one reason domestic abuse is so confusing.
p56
aa(lp57
VI would have told you myself that I was the last person on Earth
p58
aVwho would stay with a man who beats me,
p59
aVbut in fact I was a very typical victim because of my age.
p60
aVI was 22, and in the United States,
p61
aVwomen ages 16 to 24 are three times as likely
p62
aVto be domestic violence victims
p63
aVas women of other ages,
p64
aVand over 500 women and girls this age
p65
aVare killed every year by abusive partners,
p66
aVboyfriends, and husbands in the United States.
p67
aa(lp68
VI was also a very typical victim because I knew nothing
p69
aVabout domestic violence, its warning signs or its patterns.
p70
aa(lp71
VI met Conor on a cold, rainy January night.
p72
aVHe sat next to me on the New York City subway,
p73
aVand he started chatting me up.
p74
aVHe told me two things.
p75
aVOne was that he, too, had just graduated from an Ivy League school,
p76
aVand that he worked at a very impressive Wall Street bank.
p77
aVBut what made the biggest impression on me that first meeting
p78
aVwas that he was smart and funny
p79
aVand he looked like a farm boy.
p80
aVHe had these big cheeks, these big apple cheeks
p81
aVand this wheat-blond hair,
p82
aVand he seemed so sweet.
p83
aa(lp84
VOne of the smartest things Conor did, from the very beginning,
p85
aVwas to create the illusion that I was the dominant partner in the relationship.
p86
aVHe did this especially at the beginning
p87
aVby idolizing me.
p88
aVWe started dating, and he loved everything about me,
p89
aVthat I was smart, that I'd gone to Harvard,
p90
aVthat I was passionate about helping teenage girls, and my job.
p91
aVHe wanted to know everything about my family
p92
aVand my childhood and my hopes and dreams.
p93
aVConor believed in me, as a writer and a woman,
p94
aVin a way that no one else ever had.
p95
aVAnd he also created a magical atmosphere of trust between us
p96
aVby confessing his secret,
p97
aVwhich was that, as a very young boy starting at age four,
p98
aVhe had been savagely and repeatedly physically abused
p99
aVby his stepfather,
p100
aVand the abuse had gotten so bad that he had had to drop out of school in eighth grade,
p101
aVeven though he was very smart,
p102
aVand he'd spent almost 20 years rebuilding his life.
p103
aVWhich is why that Ivy League degree
p104
aVand the Wall Street job and his bright shiny future
p105
aVmeant so much to him.
p106
aVIf you had told me
p107
aVthat this smart, funny, sensitive man who adored me
p108
aVwould one day dictate whether or not I wore makeup,
p109
aVhow short my skirts were,
p110
aVwhere I lived, what jobs I took,
p111
aVwho my friends were and where I spent Christmas,
p112
aVI would have laughed at you,
p113
aVbecause there was not a hint of violence or control
p114
aVor anger in Conor at the beginning.
p115
aVI didn't know that the first stage
p116
aVin any domestic violence relationship
p117
aVis to seduce and charm the victim.
p118
aa(lp119
VI also didn't know that the second step is to isolate the victim.
p120
aVNow, Conor did not come home one day and announce,
p121
aV"You know, hey, all this Romeo and Juliet stuff has been great,
p122
aVbut I need to move into the next phase
p123
aVwhere I isolate you and I abuse you" \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p124
aV"so I need to get you out of this apartment
p125
aVwhere the neighbors can hear you scream
p126
aVand out of this city where you have friends and family
p127
aVand coworkers who can see the bruises."
p128
aVInstead, Conor came home one Friday evening
p129
aVand he told me that he had quit his job that day,
p130
aVhis dream job,
p131
aVand he said that he had quit his job because of me,
p132
aVbecause I had made him feel so safe and loved
p133
aVthat he didn't need to prove himself on Wall Street anymore,
p134
aVand he just wanted to get out of the city
p135
aVand away from his abusive, dysfunctional family,
p136
aVand move to a tiny town in New England
p137
aVwhere he could start his life over with me by his side.
p138
aVNow, the last thing I wanted to do was leave New York,
p139
aVand my dream job,
p140
aVbut I thought you made sacrifices for your soulmate,
p141
aVso I agreed, and I quit my job,
p142
aVand Conor and I left Manhattan together.
p143
aVI had no idea I was falling into crazy love,
p144
aVthat I was walking headfirst into a carefully laid
p145
aVphysical, financial and psychological trap.
p146
aa(lp147
VThe next step in the domestic violence pattern
p148
aVis to introduce the threat of violence
p149
aVand see how she reacts.
p150
aVAnd here's where those guns come in.
p151
aVAs soon as we moved to New England \u2014 you know,
p152
aVthat place where Connor was supposed to feel so safe \u2014
p153
aVhe bought three guns.
p154
aVHe kept one in the glove compartment of our car.
p155
aVHe kept one under the pillows on our bed,
p156
aVand the third one he kept in his pocket at all times.
p157
aVAnd he said that he needed those guns
p158
aVbecause of the trauma he'd experienced as a young boy.
p159
aVHe needed them to feel protected.
p160
aVBut those guns were really a message for me,
p161
aVand even though he hadn't raised a hand to me,
p162
aVmy life was already in grave danger every minute of every day.
p163
aa(lp164
VConor first physically attacked me
p165
aVfive days before our wedding.
p166
aVIt was 7 a.m. I still had on my nightgown.
p167
aVI was working on my computer trying to finish a freelance writing assignment,
p168
aVand I got frustrated,
p169
aVand Conor used my anger as an excuse
p170
aVto put both of his hands around my neck
p171
aVand to squeeze so tightly that I could not breathe or scream,
p172
aVand he used the chokehold
p173
aVto hit my head repeatedly against the wall.
p174
aVFive days later, the ten bruises on my neck had just faded,
p175
aVand I put on my mother's wedding dress,
p176
aVand I married him.
p177
aa(lp178
VDespite what had happened,
p179
aVI was sure we were going to live happily ever after,
p180
aVbecause I loved him, and he loved me so much.
p181
aVAnd he was very, very sorry.
p182
aVHe had just been really stressed out by the wedding
p183
aVand by becoming a family with me.
p184
aVIt was an isolated incident,
p185
aVand he was never going to hurt me again.
p186
aa(lp187
VIt happened twice more on the honeymoon.
p188
aVThe first time, I was driving to find a secret beach
p189
aVand I got lost,
p190
aVand he punched me in the side of my head so hard
p191
aVthat the other side of my head repeatedly hit
p192
aVthe driver's side window.
p193
aVAnd then a few days later, driving home from our honeymoon,
p194
aVhe got frustrated by traffic,
p195
aVand he threw a cold Big Mac in my face.
p196
aVConor proceeded to beat me once or twice a week
p197
aVfor the next two and a half years of our marriage.
p198
aa(lp199
VI was mistaken in thinking that I was unique
p200
aVand alone in this situation.
p201
aVOne in three American women
p202
aVexperiences domestic violence or stalking at some point in her life,
p203
aVand the CDC reports that 15 million children
p204
aVare abused every year, 15 million.
p205
aVSo actually, I was in very good company.
p206
aa(lp207
VBack to my question:
p208
aVWhy did I stay?
p209
aVThe answer is easy.
p210
aVI didn't know he was abusing me.
p211
aVEven though he held those loaded guns to my head,
p212
aVpushed me down stairs,
p213
aVthreatened to kill our dog,
p214
aVpulled the key out of the car ignition as I drove down the highway,
p215
aVpoured coffee grinds on my head
p216
aVas I dressed for a job interview,
p217
aVI never once thought of myself as a battered wife.
p218
aVInstead, I was a very strong woman
p219
aVin love with a deeply troubled man,
p220
aVand I was the only person on Earth
p221
aVwho could help Conor face his demons.
p222
aa(lp223
VThe other question everybody asks is,
p224
aVwhy doesn't she just leave?
p225
aVWhy didn't I walk out? I could have left any time.
p226
aVTo me, this is the saddest and most painful question that people ask,
p227
aVbecause we victims know something you usually don't:
p228
aVIt's incredibly dangerous to leave an abuser.
p229
aVBecause the final step in the domestic violence pattern
p230
aVis kill her.
p231
aVOver 70 percent of domestic violence murders
p232
aVhappen after the victim has ended the relationship,
p233
aVafter she's gotten out,
p234
aVbecause then the abuser has nothing left to lose.
p235
aVOther outcomes include long-term stalking,
p236
aVeven after the abuser remarries;
p237
aVdenial of financial resources;
p238
aVand manipulation of the family court system
p239
aVto terrify the victim and her children,
p240
aVwho are regularly forced by family court judges
p241
aVto spend unsupervised time
p242
aVwith the man who beat their mother.
p243
aVAnd still we ask, why doesn't she just leave?
p244
aa(lp245
VI was able to leave,
p246
aVbecause of one final, sadistic beating
p247
aVthat broke through my denial.
p248
aVI realized that the man who I loved so much
p249
aVwas going to kill me if I let him.
p250
aVSo I broke the silence.
p251
aVI told everyone:
p252
aVthe police, my neighbors,
p253
aVmy friends and family, total strangers,
p254
aVand I'm here today because you all helped me.
p255
aa(lp256
VWe tend to stereotype victims
p257
aVas grisly headlines,
p258
aVself-destructive women, damaged goods.
p259
aVThe question, "Why does she stay?"
p260
aVis code for some people for, "It's her fault for staying,"
p261
aVas if victims intentionally choose to fall in love with men
p262
aVintent upon destroying us.
p263
aa(lp264
VBut since publishing "Crazy Love,"
p265
aVI have heard hundreds of stories from men and women
p266
aVwho also got out,
p267
aVwho learned an invaluable life lesson from what happened,
p268
aVand who rebuilt lives \u2014 joyous, happy lives \u2014
p269
aVas employees, wives and mothers,
p270
aVlives completely free of violence, like me.
p271
aVBecause it turns out that I'm actually a very typical domestic violence victim
p272
aVand a typical domestic violence survivor.
p273
aVI remarried a kind and gentle man,
p274
aVand we have those three kids.
p275
aVI have that black lab, and I have that minivan.
p276
aVWhat I will never have again,
p277
aVever,
p278
aVis a loaded gun held to my head
p279
aVby someone who says that he loves me.
p280
aa(lp281
VRight now, maybe you're thinking,
p282
aV"Wow, this is fascinating,"
p283
aVor, "Wow, how stupid was she,"
p284
aVbut this whole time, I've actually been talking about you.
p285
aVI promise you there are several people
p286
aVlistening to me right now
p287
aVwho are currently being abused
p288
aVor who were abused as children
p289
aVor who are abusers themselves.
p290
aVAbuse could be affecting your daughter,
p291
aVyour sister, your best friend right now.
p292
aa(lp293
VI was able to end my own crazy love story
p294
aVby breaking the silence.
p295
aVI'm still breaking the silence today.
p296
aVIt's my way of helping other victims,
p297
aVand it's my final request of you.
p298
aVTalk about what you heard here.
p299
aVAbuse thrives only in silence.
p300
aVYou have the power to end domestic violence
p301
aVsimply by shining a spotlight on it.
p302
aVWe victims need everyone.
p303
aVWe need every one of you to understand
p304
aVthe secrets of domestic violence.
p305
aVShow abuse the light of day by talking about it
p306
aVwith your children, your coworkers,
p307
aVyour friends and family.
p308
aVRecast survivors as wonderful, lovable people
p309
aVwith full futures.
p310
aVRecognize the early signs of violence
p311
aVand conscientiously intervene,
p312
aVdeescalate it, show victims a safe way out.
p313
aVTogether we can make our beds,
p314
aVour dinner tables and our families
p315
aVthe safe and peaceful oases they should be.
p316
aa(lp317
VThank you.
