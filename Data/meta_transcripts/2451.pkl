VThere we were,
p4
aVsouls and bodies packed into a Texas church
p5
aVon the last night of our lives.
p6
aVPacked into a room just like this,
p7
aVbut with creaky wooden pews draped in worn-down red fabric,
p8
aVwith an organ to my left and a choir at my back
p9
aVand a baptism pool built into the wall behind them.
p10
aVA room like this, nonetheless.
p11
aVWith the same great feelings of suspense,
p12
aVthe same deep hopes for salvation,
p13
aVthe same sweat in the palms
p14
aVand the same people in the back not paying attention.
p15
aa(lp16
V(Laughter)
p17
aa(lp18
VThis was December 31, 1999,
p19
aVthe night of the Second Coming of Christ,
p20
aVand the end of the world as I knew it.
p21
aVI had turned 12 that year
p22
aVand had reached the age of accountability.
p23
aVAnd once I stopped complaining
p24
aVabout how unfair it was that Jesus would return
p25
aVas soon as I had to be accountable for all that I had done,
p26
aVI figured I had better get my house in order very quickly.
p27
aa(lp28
VSo I went to church as often as I could.
p29
aVI listened for silence as anxiously as one might listen for noise,
p30
aVtrying to be sure that the Lord hadn't pulled a fast one on me
p31
aVand decided to come back early.
p32
aa(lp33
VAnd just in case he did,
p34
aVI built a backup plan,
p35
aVby reading the "Left Behind" books that were all the rage at the time.
p36
aVAnd I found in their pages
p37
aVthat if I was not taken in the rapture at midnight,
p38
aVI had another shot.
p39
aVAll I had to do was avoid taking the mark of the beast,
p40
aVfight off demons, plagues and the Antichrist himself.
p41
aVIt would be hard \u2014
p42
aa(lp43
V(Laughter)
p44
aa(lp45
Vbut I knew I could do it.
p46
aa(lp47
V(Laughter)
p48
aa(lp49
VBut planning time was over now.
p50
aVIt was 11:50pm.
p51
aVWe had 10 minutes left,
p52
aVand my pastor called us out of the pews and down to the altar
p53
aVbecause he wanted to be praying when midnight struck.
p54
aVSo every faction of the congregation
p55
aVtook its place.
p56
aVThe choir stayed in the choir stand,
p57
aVthe deacons and their wives \u2014
p58
aVor the Baptist Bourgeoisie as I like to call them \u2014
p59
aa(lp60
V(Laughter)
p61
aa(lp62
Vtook first position in front of the altar.
p63
aVYou see, in America,
p64
aVeven the Second Coming of Christ has a VIP section.
p65
aa(lp66
V(Laughter)
p67
aa(lp68
V(Applause)
p69
aa(lp70
VAnd right behind the Baptist Bourgeoisie
p71
aVwere the elderly \u2014
p72
aVthese men and women whose young backs had been bent under hot suns
p73
aVin the cotton fields of East Texas,
p74
aVand whose skin seemed to be burnt a creaseless noble brown,
p75
aVjust like the clay of East Texas,
p76
aVand whose hopes and dreams for what life might become
p77
aVoutside of East Texas
p78
aVhad sometimes been bent and broken
p79
aVeven further than their backs.
p80
aa(lp81
VYes, these men and women were the stars of the show for me.
p82
aVThey had waited their whole lives for this moment,
p83
aVjust as their medieval predecessors had longed for the end of the world,
p84
aVand just as my grandmother waited for the Oprah Winfrey Show
p85
aVto come on Channel 8 every day at 4 o'clock.
p86
aVAnd as she made her way to the altar,
p87
aVI snuck right in behind her,
p88
aVbecause I knew for sure
p89
aVthat my grandmother was going to heaven.
p90
aVAnd I thought that if I held on to her hand during this prayer,
p91
aVI might go right on with her.
p92
aa(lp93
VSo I held on
p94
aVand I closed my eyes
p95
aVto listen,
p96
aVto wait.
p97
aVAnd the prayers got louder.
p98
aVAnd the shouts of response to the call of the prayer
p99
aVwent up higher even still.
p100
aVAnd the organ rolled on in to add the dirge.
p101
aVAnd the heat came on to add to the sweat.
p102
aVAnd my hand gripped firmer,
p103
aVso I wouldn't be the one left in the field.
p104
aVMy eyes clenched tighter
p105
aVso I wouldn't see the wheat being separated from the chaff.
p106
aVAnd then a voice rang out above us:
p107
aV"Amen."
p108
aa(lp109
VIt was over.
p110
aVI looked at the clock.
p111
aVIt was after midnight.
p112
aVI looked at the elder believers
p113
aVwhose savior had not come,
p114
aVwho were too proud to show any signs of disappointment,
p115
aVwho had believed too much and for too long
p116
aVto start doubting now.
p117
aVBut I was upset on their behalf.
p118
aVThey had been duped,
p119
aVhoodwinked, bamboozled,
p120
aVand I had gone right along with them.
p121
aVI had prayed their prayers,
p122
aVI had yielded not to temptation as best I could.
p123
aVI had dipped my head not once, but twice
p124
aVin that snot-inducing baptism pool.
p125
aVI had believed.
p126
aVNow what?
p127
aa(lp128
VI got home just in time to turn on the television
p129
aVand watch Peter Jennings announce the new millennium
p130
aVas it rolled in around the world.
p131
aVIt struck me that it would have been strange anyway,
p132
aVfor Jesus to come back again and again
p133
aVbased on the different time zones.
p134
aa(lp135
V(Laughter)
p136
aa(lp137
VAnd this made me feel even more ridiculous \u2014
p138
aVhurt, really.
p139
aVBut there on that night, I did not stop believing.
p140
aVI just believed a new thing:
p141
aVthat it was possible not to believe.
p142
aVIt was possible the answers I had were wrong,
p143
aVthat the questions themselves were wrong.
p144
aVAnd now, where there was once a mountain of certitude,
p145
aVthere was, running right down to its foundation,
p146
aVa spring of doubt,
p147
aVa spring that promised rivers.
p148
aa(lp149
VI can trace the whole drama of my life
p150
aVback to that night in that church
p151
aVwhen my savior did not come for me;
p152
aVwhen the thing I believed most certainly
p153
aVturned out to be, if not a lie,
p154
aVthen not quite the truth.
p155
aVAnd even though most of you prepared for Y2K in a very different way,
p156
aVI'm convinced that you are here
p157
aVbecause some part of you has done the same thing that I have done
p158
aVsince the dawn of this new century,
p159
aVsince my mother left and my father stayed away
p160
aVand my Lord refused to come.
p161
aVAnd I held out my hand,
p162
aVreaching for something to believe in.
p163
aa(lp164
VI held on when I arrived at Yale at 18,
p165
aVwith the faith that my journey from Oak Cliff, Texas
p166
aVwas a chance to leave behind all the challenges I had known,
p167
aVthe broken dreams and broken bodies I had seen.
p168
aVBut when I found myself back home one winter break,
p169
aVwith my face planted in the floor,
p170
aVmy hands tied behind my back
p171
aVand a burglar's gun pressed to my head,
p172
aVI knew that even the best education couldn't save me.
p173
aa(lp174
VI held on when I showed up at Lehman Brothers
p175
aVas an intern in 2008.
p176
aa(lp177
V(Laughter)
p178
aa(lp179
VSo hopeful \u2014
p180
aa(lp181
V(Laughter)
p182
aa(lp183
Vthat I called home to inform my family
p184
aVthat we'd never be poor again.
p185
aa(lp186
V(Laughter)
p187
aa(lp188
VBut as I witnessed this temple of finance
p189
aVcome crashing down before my eyes,
p190
aVI knew that even the best job couldn't save me.
p191
aa(lp192
VI held on when I showed up in Washington DC as a young staffer,
p193
aVwho had heard a voice call out from Illinois,
p194
aVsaying, "It's been a long time coming,
p195
aVbut in this election, change has come to America."
p196
aVBut as the Congress ground to a halt
p197
aVand the country ripped at the seams
p198
aVand hope and change began to feel like a cruel joke,
p199
aVI knew that even the political second coming
p200
aVcould not save me.
p201
aa(lp202
VI had knelt faithfully at the altar of the American Dream,
p203
aVpraying to the gods of my time
p204
aVof success,
p205
aVand money,
p206
aVand power.
p207
aVBut over and over again,
p208
aVmidnight struck, and I opened my eyes
p209
aVto see that all of these gods were dead.
p210
aa(lp211
VAnd from that graveyard,
p212
aVI began the search once more,
p213
aVnot because I was brave,
p214
aVbut because I knew that I would either believe
p215
aVor I would die.
p216
aa(lp217
VSo I took a pilgrimage to yet another mecca,
p218
aVHarvard Business School \u2014
p219
aa(lp220
V(Laughter)
p221
aa(lp222
Vthis time, knowing that I could not simply accept the salvation
p223
aVthat it claimed to offer.
p224
aVNo, I knew there'd be more work to do.
p225
aa(lp226
VThe work began in the dark corner of a crowded party,
p227
aVin the late night of an early, miserable Cambridge winter,
p228
aVwhen three friends and I asked a question
p229
aVthat young folks searching for something real have asked
p230
aVfor a very long time:
p231
aV"What if we took a road trip?"
p232
aa(lp233
V(Laughter)
p234
aa(lp235
VWe didn't know where'd we go or how we'd get there,
p236
aVbut we knew we had to do it.
p237
aVBecause all our lives we yearned, as Jack Kerouac wrote,
p238
aVto "sneak out into the night and disappear somewhere,"
p239
aVand go find out what everybody was doing
p240
aVall over the country.
p241
aVSo even though there were other voices who said
p242
aVthat the risk was too great and the proof too thin,
p243
aVwe went on anyhow.
p244
aa(lp245
VWe went on 8,000 miles across America in the summer of 2013,
p246
aVthrough the cow pastures of Montana, through the desolation of Detroit,
p247
aVthrough the swamps of New Orleans,
p248
aVwhere we found and worked with men and women
p249
aVwho were building small businesses
p250
aVthat made purpose their bottom line.
p251
aVAnd having been trained at the West Point of capitalism,
p252
aVthis struck us as a revolutionary idea.
p253
aa(lp254
V(Laughter)
p255
aa(lp256
VAnd this idea spread,
p257
aVgrowing into a nonprofit called MBAs Across America,
p258
aVa movement that landed me here on this stage today.
p259
aVIt spread because we found a great hunger in our generation
p260
aVfor purpose, for meaning.
p261
aVIt spread because we found countless entrepreneurs
p262
aVin the nooks and crannies of America
p263
aVwho were creating jobs and changing lives
p264
aVand who needed a little help.
p265
aa(lp266
VBut if I'm being honest, it also spread
p267
aVbecause I fought to spread it.
p268
aVThere was no length to which I would not go
p269
aVto preach this gospel,
p270
aVto get more people to believe
p271
aVthat we could bind the wounds of a broken country,
p272
aVone social business at a time.
p273
aVBut it was this journey of evangelism
p274
aVthat led me to the rather different gospel
p275
aVthat I've come to share with you today.
p276
aa(lp277
VIt began one evening almost a year ago
p278
aVat the Museum of Natural History in New York City,
p279
aVat a gala for alumni of Harvard Business School.
p280
aVUnder a full-size replica of a whale,
p281
aVI sat with the titans of our time
p282
aVas they celebrated their peers and their good deeds.
p283
aVThere was pride in a room
p284
aVwhere net worth and assets under management
p285
aVsurpassed half a trillion dollars.
p286
aVWe looked over all that we had made,
p287
aVand it was good.
p288
aa(lp289
V(Laughter)
p290
aa(lp291
VBut it just so happened,
p292
aVtwo days later,
p293
aVI had to travel up the road to Harlem,
p294
aVwhere I found myself sitting in an urban farm
p295
aVthat had once been a vacant lot,
p296
aVlistening to a man named Tony tell me of the kids
p297
aVthat showed up there every day.
p298
aVAll of them lived below the poverty line.
p299
aVMany of them carried all of their belongings in a backpack
p300
aVto avoid losing them in a homeless shelter.
p301
aVSome of them came to Tony's program,
p302
aVcalled Harlem Grown,
p303
aVto get the only meal they had each day.
p304
aVTony told me that he started Harlem Grown with money from his pension,
p305
aVafter 20 years as a cab driver.
p306
aVHe told me that he didn't give himself a salary,
p307
aVbecause despite success, the program struggled for resources.
p308
aVHe told me that he would take any help
p309
aVthat he could get.
p310
aVAnd I was there as that help.
p311
aa(lp312
VBut as I left Tony, I felt the sting and salt of tears
p313
aVwelling up in my eyes.
p314
aVI felt the weight of revelation
p315
aVthat I could sit in one room on one night,
p316
aVwhere a few hundred people had half a trillion dollars,
p317
aVand another room, two days later,
p318
aVjust 50 blocks up the road,
p319
aVwhere a man was going without a salary
p320
aVto get a child her only meal of the day.
p321
aa(lp322
VAnd it wasn't the glaring inequality that made me want to cry,
p323
aVit wasn't the thought of hungry, homeless kids,
p324
aVit wasn't rage toward the one percent
p325
aVor pity toward the 99.
p326
aVNo, I was disturbed because I had finally realized
p327
aVthat I was the dialysis
p328
aVfor a country that needed a kidney transplant.
p329
aVI realized that my story stood in for all those
p330
aVwho were expected to pick themselves up by their bootstraps,
p331
aVeven if they didn't have any boots;
p332
aVthat my organization stood in
p333
aVfor all the structural, systemic help that never went to Harlem
p334
aVor Appalachia or the Lower 9th Ward;
p335
aVthat my voice stood in for all those voices
p336
aVthat seemed too unlearned, too unwashed, too unaccommodated.
p337
aa(lp338
VAnd the shame of that,
p339
aVthat shame washed over me
p340
aVlike the shame of sitting in front of the television,
p341
aVwatching Peter Jennings announce the new millennium
p342
aVagain
p343
aVand again
p344
aVand again.
p345
aVI had been duped,
p346
aVhoodwinked,
p347
aVbamboozled.
p348
aVBut this time, the false savior was me.
p349
aa(lp350
VYou see, I've come a long way  from that altar
p351
aVon the night I thought the world would end,
p352
aVfrom a world where people spoke in tongues
p353
aVand saw suffering as a necessary act of God
p354
aVand took a text to be infallible truth.
p355
aVYes, I've come so far
p356
aVthat I'm right back where I started.
p357
aa(lp358
VBecause it simply is not true to say
p359
aVthat we live in an age of disbelief \u2014
p360
aVno, we believe today just as much as any time that came before.
p361
aVSome of us may believe in the prophecy of Brené Brown
p362
aVor Tony Robbins.
p363
aVWe may believe in the bible of The New Yorker
p364
aVor the Harvard Business Review.
p365
aVWe may believe most deeply
p366
aVwhen we worship right here at the church of TED,
p367
aVbut we desperately want to believe,
p368
aVwe need to believe.
p369
aVWe speak in the tongues of charismatic leaders
p370
aVthat promise to solve all our problems.
p371
aVWe see suffering as a necessary act of the capitalism that is our god,
p372
aVwe take the text of technological progress
p373
aVto be infallible truth.
p374
aVAnd we hardly realize the human price we pay
p375
aVwhen we fail to question one brick,
p376
aVbecause we fear it might shake our whole foundation.
p377
aa(lp378
VBut if you are disturbed
p379
aVby the unconscionable things that we have come to accept,
p380
aVthen it must be questioning time.
p381
aVSo I have not a gospel of disruption or innovation
p382
aVor a triple bottom line.
p383
aVI do not have a gospel of faith to share with you today, in fact.
p384
aVI have and I offer a gospel of doubt.
p385
aVThe gospel of doubt does not ask that you stop believing,
p386
aVit asks that you believe a new thing:
p387
aVthat it is possible not to believe.
p388
aVIt is possible the answers we have are wrong,
p389
aVit is possible the questions themselves are wrong.
p390
aVYes, the gospel of doubt means that it is possible that we,
p391
aVon this stage, in this room,
p392
aVare wrong.
p393
aVBecause it raises the question, "Why?"
p394
aVWith all the power that we hold in our hands,
p395
aVwhy are people still suffering so bad?
p396
aa(lp397
VThis doubt leads me to share that we are putting my organization,
p398
aVMBAs Across America,
p399
aVout of business.
p400
aVWe have shed our staff and closed our doors
p401
aVand we will share our model freely
p402
aVwith anyone who sees their power to do this work
p403
aVwithout waiting for our permission.
p404
aVThis doubt compels me
p405
aVto renounce the role of savior
p406
aVthat some have placed on me,
p407
aVbecause our time is too short and our odds are too long
p408
aVto wait for second comings,
p409
aVwhen the truth is that there will be no miracles here.
p410
aa(lp411
VAnd this doubt, it fuels me,
p412
aVit gives me hope
p413
aVthat when our troubles overwhelm us,
p414
aVwhen the paths laid out for us seem to lead to our demise,
p415
aVwhen our healers bring no comfort to our wounds,
p416
aVit will not be our blind faith \u2014
p417
aVno, it will be our humble doubt
p418
aVthat shines a little light into the darkness of our lives
p419
aVand of our world
p420
aVand lets us raise our voice to whisper
p421
aVor to shout
p422
aVor to say simply,
p423
aVvery simply,
p424
aV"There must be another way."
p425
