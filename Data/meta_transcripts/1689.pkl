VSo raise your hand if you know someone
p4
aVin your immediate family or circle of friends
p5
aVwho suffers from some form of mental illness.
p6
aVYeah. I thought so. Not surprised.
p7
aa(lp8
VAnd raise your hand if you think that
p9
aVbasic research on fruit flies has anything to do
p10
aVwith understanding mental illness in humans.
p11
aVYeah. I thought so. I'm also not surprised.
p12
aVI can see I've got my work cut out for me here.
p13
aa(lp14
VAs we heard from Dr. Insel this morning,
p15
aVpsychiatric disorders like autism, depression and schizophrenia
p16
aVtake a terrible toll on human suffering.
p17
aVWe know much less about their treatment
p18
aVand the understanding of their basic mechanisms
p19
aVthan we do about diseases of the body.
p20
aVThink about it: In 2013,
p21
aVthe second decade of the millennium,
p22
aVif you're concerned about a cancer diagnosis
p23
aVand you go to your doctor, you get bone scans,
p24
aVbiopsies and blood tests.
p25
aVIn 2013, if you're concerned about a depression diagnosis,
p26
aVyou go to your doctor, and what do you get?
p27
aVA questionnaire.
p28
aVNow, part of the reason for this is that we have
p29
aVan oversimplified and increasingly outmoded view
p30
aVof the biological basis of psychiatric disorders.
p31
aVWe tend to view them \u2014
p32
aVand the popular press aids and abets this view \u2014
p33
aVas chemical imbalances in the brain,
p34
aVas if the brain were some kind of bag of chemical soup
p35
aVfull of dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine.
p36
aVThis view is conditioned by the fact
p37
aVthat many of the drugs that are prescribed to treat these disorders,
p38
aVlike Prozac, act by globally changing brain chemistry,
p39
aVas if the brain were indeed a bag of chemical soup.
p40
aVBut that can't be the answer,
p41
aVbecause these drugs actually don't work all that well.
p42
aVA lot of people won't take them, or stop taking them,
p43
aVbecause of their unpleasant side effects.
p44
aVThese drugs have so many side effects
p45
aVbecause using them to treat a complex psychiatric disorder
p46
aVis a bit like trying to change your engine oil
p47
aVby opening a can and pouring it all over the engine block.
p48
aVSome of it will dribble into the right place,
p49
aVbut a lot of it will do more harm than good.
p50
aa(lp51
VNow, an emerging view
p52
aVthat you also heard about from Dr. Insel this morning,
p53
aVis that psychiatric disorders are actually
p54
aVdisturbances of neural circuits that mediate
p55
aVemotion, mood and affect.
p56
aVWhen we think about cognition,
p57
aVwe analogize the brain to a computer. That's no problem.
p58
aVWell it turns out that the computer analogy
p59
aVis just as valid for emotion.
p60
aVIt's just that we don't tend to think about it that way.
p61
aVBut we know much less about the circuit basis
p62
aVof psychiatric disorders
p63
aVbecause of the overwhelming dominance
p64
aVof this chemical imbalance hypothesis.
p65
aa(lp66
VNow, it's not that chemicals are not important
p67
aVin psychiatric disorders.
p68
aVIt's just that they don't bathe the brain like soup.
p69
aVRather, they're released in very specific locations
p70
aVand they act on specific synapses
p71
aVto change the flow of information in the brain.
p72
aVSo if we ever really want to understand
p73
aVthe biological basis of psychiatric disorders,
p74
aVwe need to pinpoint these locations in the brain
p75
aVwhere these chemicals act.
p76
aVOtherwise, we're going to keep pouring oil all over our mental engines
p77
aVand suffering the consequences.
p78
aa(lp79
VNow to begin to overcome our ignorance
p80
aVof the role of brain chemistry in brain circuitry,
p81
aVit's helpful to work on what we biologists call
p82
aV"model organisms,"
p83
aVanimals like fruit flies and laboratory mice,
p84
aVin which we can apply powerful genetic techniques
p85
aVto molecularly identify and pinpoint
p86
aVspecific classes of neurons,
p87
aVas you heard about in Allan Jones's talk this morning.
p88
aVMoreover, once we can do that,
p89
aVwe can actually activate specific neurons
p90
aVor we can destroy or inhibit the activity of those neurons.
p91
aVSo if we inhibit a particular type of neuron,
p92
aVand we find that a behavior is blocked,
p93
aVwe can conclude that those neurons
p94
aVare necessary for that behavior.
p95
aVOn the other hand, if we activate a group of neurons
p96
aVand we find that that produces the behavior,
p97
aVwe can conclude that those neurons are sufficient for the behavior.
p98
aVSo in this way, by doing this kind of test,
p99
aVwe can draw cause and effect relationships
p100
aVbetween the activity of specific neurons
p101
aVin particular circuits and particular behaviors,
p102
aVsomething that is extremely difficult, if not impossible,
p103
aVto do right now in humans.
p104
aa(lp105
VBut can an organism like a fruit fly, which is \u2014
p106
aVit's a great model organism
p107
aVbecause it's got a small brain,
p108
aVit's capable of complex and sophisticated behaviors,
p109
aVit breeds quickly, and it's cheap.
p110
aVBut can an organism like this
p111
aVteach us anything about emotion-like states?
p112
aVDo these organisms even have emotion-like states,
p113
aVor are they just little digital robots?
p114
aa(lp115
VCharles Darwin believed that insects have emotion
p116
aVand express them in their behaviors, as he wrote
p117
aVin his 1872 monograph on the expression of the emotions in man and animals.
p118
aVAnd my eponymous colleague, Seymour Benzer, believed it as well.
p119
aVSeymour is the man that introduced the use of drosophila
p120
aVhere at CalTech in the '60s as a model organism
p121
aVto study the connection between genes and behavior.
p122
aVSeymour recruited me to CalTech in the late 1980s.
p123
aVHe was my Jedi and my rabbi while he was here,
p124
aVand Seymour taught me both to love flies
p125
aVand also to play with science.
p126
aa(lp127
VSo how do we ask this question?
p128
aVIt's one thing to believe that flies have emotion-like states,
p129
aVbut how do we actually find out whether that's true or not?
p130
aVNow, in humans we often infer emotional states,
p131
aVas you'll hear later today, from facial expressions.
p132
aVHowever, it's a little difficult to do that in fruit flies.
p133
aV(Laughter)
p134
aVIt's kind of like landing on Mars
p135
aVand looking out the window of your spaceship
p136
aVat all the little green men who are surrounding it
p137
aVand trying to figure out, "How do I find out
p138
aVif they have emotions or not?"
p139
aVWhat can we do? It's not so easy.
p140
aa(lp141
VWell, one of the ways that we can start
p142
aVis to try to come up with some general characteristics
p143
aVor properties of emotion-like states
p144
aVsuch as arousal, and see if we can identify
p145
aVany fly behaviors that might exhibit some of those properties.
p146
aVSo three important ones that I can think of
p147
aVare persistence, gradations in intensity, and valence.
p148
aVPersistence means long-lasting.
p149
aVWe all know that the stimulus that triggers an emotion
p150
aVcauses that emotion to last long after the stimulus is gone.
p151
aVGradations of intensity means what it sounds like.
p152
aVYou can dial up the intensity or dial down the intensity of an emotion.
p153
aVIf you're a little bit unhappy, the corners of your mouth
p154
aVturn down and you sniffle,
p155
aVand if you're very unhappy, tears pour down your face
p156
aVand you might sob.
p157
aVValence means good or bad, positive or negative.
p158
aa(lp159
VSo we decided to see if flies could be provoked into showing
p160
aVthe kind of behavior that you see
p161
aVby the proverbial wasp at the picnic table,
p162
aVyou know, the one that keeps coming back to your hamburger
p163
aVthe more vigorously you try to swat it away,
p164
aVand it seems to keep getting irritated.
p165
aVSo we built a device, which we call a puff-o-mat,
p166
aVin which we could deliver little brief air puffs to fruit flies
p167
aVin these plastic tubes in our laboratory bench
p168
aVand blow them away.
p169
aVAnd what we found is that if we gave these flies
p170
aVin the puff-o-mat several puffs in a row,
p171
aVthey became somewhat hyperactive
p172
aVand continued to run around for some time after the air puffs actually stopped
p173
aVand took a while to calm down.
p174
aVSo we quantified this behavior
p175
aVusing custom locomotor tracking software
p176
aVdeveloped with my collaborator Pietro Perona,
p177
aVwho's in the electrical engineering division here at CalTech.
p178
aVAnd what this quantification showed us is that,
p179
aVupon experiencing a train of these air puffs,
p180
aVthe flies appear to enter a kind of state of hyperactivity
p181
aVwhich is persistent, long-lasting,
p182
aVand also appears to be graded.
p183
aVMore puffs, or more intense puffs,
p184
aVmake the state last for a longer period of time.
p185
aa(lp186
VSo now we wanted to try to understand something
p187
aVabout what controls the duration of this state.
p188
aVSo we decided to use our puff-o-mat
p189
aVand our automated tracking software
p190
aVto screen through hundreds of lines of mutant fruit flies
p191
aVto see if we could find any that showed abnormal responses to the air puffs.
p192
aVAnd this is one of the great things about fruit flies.
p193
aVThere are repositories where you can just pick up the phone
p194
aVand order hundreds of vials of flies of different mutants
p195
aVand screen them in your assay and then find out
p196
aVwhat gene is affected in the mutation.
p197
aVSo doing the screen, we discovered one mutant
p198
aVthat took much longer than normal to calm down
p199
aVafter the air puffs,
p200
aVand when we examined the gene that was affected in this mutation,
p201
aVit turned out to encode a dopamine receptor.
p202
aVThat's right \u2014 flies, like people, have dopamine,
p203
aVand it acts on their brains and on their synapses
p204
aVthrough the same dopamine receptor molecules
p205
aVthat you and I have.
p206
aVDopamine plays a number of important functions in the brain,
p207
aVincluding in attention, arousal, reward,
p208
aVand disorders of the dopamine system have been linked
p209
aVto a number of mental disorders including drug abuse,
p210
aVParkinson's disease, and ADHD.
p211
aa(lp212
VNow, in genetics, it's a little counterintuitive.
p213
aVWe tend to infer the normal function of something
p214
aVby what doesn't happen when we take it away,
p215
aVby the opposite of what we see when we take it away.
p216
aVSo when we take away the dopamine receptor
p217
aVand the flies take longer to calm down,
p218
aVfrom that we infer that the normal function of this receptor and dopamine
p219
aVis to cause the flies to calm down faster after the puff.
p220
aVAnd that's a bit reminiscent of ADHD,
p221
aVwhich has been linked to disorders of the dopamine system in humans.
p222
aVIndeed, if we increase the levels of dopamine in normal flies
p223
aVby feeding them cocaine
p224
aVafter getting the appropriate DEA license
p225
aV\u2014 oh my God \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p226
aVwe find indeed that these cocaine-fed flies
p227
aVcalm down faster than normal flies do,
p228
aVand that's also reminiscent of ADHD,
p229
aVwhich is often treated with drugs like Ritalin
p230
aVthat act similarly to cocaine.
p231
aVSo slowly I began to realize that what started out
p232
aVas a rather playful attempt to try to annoy fruit flies
p233
aVmight actually have some relevance to a human psychiatric disorder.
p234
aa(lp235
VNow, how far does this analogy go?
p236
aVAs many of you know, individuals afflicted with ADHD
p237
aValso have learning disabilities.
p238
aVIs that true of our dopamine receptor mutant flies?
p239
aVRemarkably, the answer is yes.
p240
aVAs Seymour showed back in the 1970s,
p241
aVflies, like songbirds, as you just heard,
p242
aVare capable of learning.
p243
aVYou can train a fly to avoid an odor, shown here in blue,
p244
aVif you pair that odor with a shock.
p245
aVThen when you give those trained flies the chance to choose
p246
aVbetween a tube with the shock-paired odor and another odor,
p247
aVit avoids the tube containing the blue odor that was paired with shock.
p248
aVWell, if you do this test on dopamine receptor mutant flies,
p249
aVthey don't learn. Their learning score is zero.
p250
aVThey flunk out of CalTech.
p251
aa(lp252
VSo that means that these flies have two abnormalities,
p253
aVor phenotypes, as we geneticists call them,
p254
aVthat one finds in ADHD: hyperactivity and learning disability.
p255
aVNow what's the causal relationship, if anything, between these phenotypes?
p256
aVIn ADHD, it's often assumed that the hyperactivity
p257
aVcauses the learning disability.
p258
aVThe kids can't sit still long enough to focus, so they don't learn.
p259
aVBut it could equally be the case that it's the learning disabilities
p260
aVthat cause the hyperactivity.
p261
aVBecause the kids can't learn, they look for other things to distract their attention.
p262
aVAnd a final possibility is that there's no relationship at all
p263
aVbetween learning disabilities and hyperactivity,
p264
aVbut that they are caused by a common underlying mechanism in ADHD.
p265
aa(lp266
VNow people have been wondering about this for a long time
p267
aVin humans, but in flies we can actually test this.
p268
aVAnd the way that we do this is to delve deeply into the mind
p269
aVof the fly and begin to untangle its circuitry using genetics.
p270
aVWe take our dopamine receptor mutant flies
p271
aVand we genetically restore, or cure, the dopamine receptor
p272
aVby putting a good copy of the dopamine receptor gene
p273
aVback into the fly brain.
p274
aVBut in each fly, we put it back only into certain neurons
p275
aVand not in others, and then we test each of these flies
p276
aVfor their ability to learn and for hyperactivity.
p277
aa(lp278
VRemarkably, we find we can completely dissociate these two abnormalities.
p279
aVIf we put a good copy of the dopamine receptor back
p280
aVin this elliptical structure called the central complex,
p281
aVthe flies are no longer hyperactive, but they still can't learn.
p282
aVOn the other hand, if we put the receptor back in a different structure
p283
aVcalled the mushroom body,
p284
aVthe learning deficit is rescued, the flies learn well,
p285
aVbut they're still hyperactive.
p286
aVWhat that tells us is that dopamine
p287
aVis not bathing the brain of these flies like soup.
p288
aVRather, it's acting to control two different functions
p289
aVon two different circuits,
p290
aVso the reason there are two things wrong with our dopamine receptor flies
p291
aVis that the same receptor is controlling two different functions
p292
aVin two different regions of the brain.
p293
aVWhether the same thing is true in ADHD in humans
p294
aVwe don't know, but these kinds of results
p295
aVshould at least cause us to consider that possibility.
p296
aa(lp297
VSo these results make me and my colleagues more convinced than ever
p298
aVthat the brain is not a bag of chemical soup,
p299
aVand it's a mistake to try to treat complex psychiatric disorders
p300
aVjust by changing the flavor of the soup.
p301
aVWhat we need to do is to use our ingenuity and our scientific knowledge
p302
aVto try to design a new generation of treatments
p303
aVthat are targeted to specific neurons and specific regions of the brain
p304
aVthat are affected in particular psychiatric disorders.
p305
aVIf we can do that, we may be able to cure these disorders
p306
aVwithout the unpleasant side effects,
p307
aVputting the oil back in our mental engines,
p308
aVjust where it's needed. Thank you very much.
