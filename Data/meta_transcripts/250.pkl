VThe Value of Nothing: Out of Nothing Comes Something.
p4
aVThat was an essay I wrote when I was 11 years old
p5
aVand I got a B+. (Laughter)
p6
aVWhat I'm going to talk about: nothing out of something, and how we create.
p7
aVAnd I'm gonna try and do that within
p8
aVthe 18-minute time span that we were told to stay within,
p9
aVand to follow the TED commandments:
p10
aVthat is, actually, something that creates
p11
aVa near-death experience,
p12
aVbut near-death is good for creativity.
p13
aV(Laughter) OK.
p14
aa(lp15
VSo, I also want to explain,
p16
aVbecause Dave Eggers said he was going to heckle me
p17
aVif I said anything that was a lie, or not true to universal creativity.
p18
aVAnd I've done it this way for half the audience, who is scientific.
p19
aVWhen I say we, I don't mean you, necessarily;
p20
aVI mean me, and my right brain, my left brain
p21
aVand the one that's in between that is the censor
p22
aVand tells me what I'm saying is wrong.
p23
aVAnd I'm going do that also by looking at
p24
aVwhat I think is part of my creative process,
p25
aVwhich includes a number of things that happened, actually \u2014
p26
aVthe nothing started even earlier than the moment
p27
aVin which I'm creating something new.
p28
aVAnd that includes nature, and nurture,
p29
aVand what I refer to as nightmares.
p30
aa(lp31
VNow in the nature area, we look at whether or not
p32
aVwe are innately equipped with something, perhaps
p33
aVin our brains, some abnormal chromosome
p34
aVthat causes this muse-like effect.
p35
aVAnd some people would say that we're born with it in some other means.
p36
aVAnd others, like my mother,
p37
aVwould say that I get my material from past lives.
p38
aVSome people would also say that creativity
p39
aVmay be a function of some other neurological quirk \u2014
p40
aVvan Gogh syndrome \u2014 that you have a little bit of, you know, psychosis, or depression.
p41
aVI do have to say, somebody \u2014 I read recently
p42
aVthat van Gogh wasn't really necessarily psychotic,
p43
aVthat he might have had temporal lobe seizures,
p44
aVand that might have caused his spurt of creativity, and I don't \u2014
p45
aVI suppose it does something in some part of your brain.
p46
aVAnd I will mention that I actually developed
p47
aVtemporal lobe seizures a number of years ago,
p48
aVbut it was during the time I was writing my last book,
p49
aVand some people say that book is quite different.
p50
aa(lp51
VI think that part of it also begins with a sense of identity crisis:
p52
aVyou know, who am I, why am I this particular person,
p53
aVwhy am I not black like everybody else?
p54
aVAnd sometimes you're equipped with skills,
p55
aVbut they may not be the kind of skills that enable creativity.
p56
aVI used to draw. I thought I would be an artist.
p57
aVAnd I had a miniature poodle.
p58
aVAnd it wasn't bad, but it wasn't really creative.
p59
aVBecause all I could really do was represent in a very one-on-one way.
p60
aVAnd I have a sense that I probably copied this from a book.
p61
aVAnd then, I also wasn't really shining in a certain area that I wanted to be,
p62
aVand you know, you look at those scores, and it wasn't bad,
p63
aVbut it was not certainly predictive that I would one day make
p64
aVmy living out of the artful arrangement of words.
p65
aa(lp66
VAlso, one of the principles of creativity is to have a little childhood trauma.
p67
aVAnd I had the usual kind that I think a lot of people had,
p68
aVand that is that, you know, I had expectations placed on me.
p69
aVThat figure right there, by the way,
p70
aVfigure right there was a toy given to me when I was but nine years old,
p71
aVand it was to help me become a doctor from a very early age.
p72
aVI have some ones that were long lasting: from the age of five to 15,
p73
aVthis was supposed to be my side occupation,
p74
aVand it led to a sense of failure.
p75
aa(lp76
VBut actually, there was something quite real in my life
p77
aVthat happened when I was about 14.
p78
aVAnd it was discovered that my brother, in 1967, and then my father,
p79
aVsix months later, had brain tumors.
p80
aVAnd my mother believed that something had gone wrong,
p81
aVand she was gonna find out what it was, and she was gonna fix it.
p82
aVMy father was a Baptist minister, and he believed in miracles,
p83
aVand that God's will would take care of that.
p84
aVBut, of course, they ended up dying, six months apart.
p85
aVAnd after that, my mother believed that it was fate, or curses
p86
aV\u2014 she went looking through all the reasons in the universe
p87
aVwhy this would have happened.
p88
aVEverything except randomness. She did not believe in randomness.
p89
aVThere was a reason for everything.
p90
aVAnd one of the reasons, she thought, was that her mother,
p91
aVwho had died when she was very young, was angry at her.
p92
aVAnd so, I had this notion of death all around me,
p93
aVbecause my mother also believed that I would be next, and she would be next.
p94
aVAnd when you are faced with the prospect of death very soon,
p95
aVyou begin to think very much about everything.
p96
aVYou become very creative, in a survival sense.
p97
aa(lp98
VAnd this, then, led to my big questions.
p99
aVAnd they're the same ones that I have today.
p100
aVAnd they are: why do things happen, and how do things happen?
p101
aVAnd the one my mother asked: how do I make things happen?
p102
aVIt's a wonderful way to look at these questions, when you write a story.
p103
aVBecause, after all, in that framework, between page one and 300,
p104
aVyou have to answer this question of why things happen, how things happen,
p105
aVin what order they happen. What are the influences?
p106
aVHow do I, as the narrator, as the writer, also influence that?
p107
aVAnd it's also one that, I think, many of our scientists have been asking.
p108
aVIt's a kind of cosmology, and I have to develop a cosmology of my own universe,
p109
aVas the creator of that universe.
p110
aa(lp111
VAnd you see, there's a lot of back and forth
p112
aVin trying to make that happen, trying to figure it out
p113
aV\u2014 years and years, oftentimes.
p114
aVSo, when I look at creativity, I also think that it is this sense or this inability
p115
aVto repress, my looking at associations in practically anything in life.
p116
aVAnd I got a lot of them during what's been going on
p117
aVthroughout this conference,
p118
aValmost everything that's been going on.
p119
aa(lp120
VAnd so I'm going to use, as the metaphor, this association:
p121
aVquantum mechanics, which I really don't understand,
p122
aVbut I'm still gonna use it as the process
p123
aVfor explaining how it is the metaphor.
p124
aVSo, in quantum mechanics, of course, you have dark energy and dark matter.
p125
aVAnd it's the same thing in looking at these questions of how things happen.
p126
aVThere's a lot of unknown, and you often don't know what it is except by its absence.
p127
aVBut when you make those associations,
p128
aVyou want them to come together in a kind of synergy in the story,
p129
aVand what you're finding is what matters. The meaning.
p130
aVAnd that's what I look for in my work, a personal meaning.
p131
aa(lp132
VThere is also the uncertainty principle, which is part of quantum mechanics,
p133
aVas I understand it. (Laughter)
p134
aVAnd this happens constantly in the writing.
p135
aVAnd there's the terrible and dreaded observer effect,
p136
aVin which you're looking for something, and
p137
aVyou know, things are happening simultaneously,
p138
aVand you're looking at it in a different way,
p139
aVand you're trying to really look for the about-ness,
p140
aVor what is this story about. And if you try too hard,
p141
aVthen you will only write the about.
p142
aVYou won't discover anything.
p143
aVAnd what you were supposed to find,
p144
aVwhat you hoped to find in some serendipitous way,
p145
aVis no longer there.
p146
aVNow, I don't want to ignore
p147
aVthe other side of what happens in our universe,
p148
aVlike many of our scientists have.
p149
aVAnd so, I am going to just throw in string theory here,
p150
aVand just say that creative people are multidimensional,
p151
aVand there are 11 levels, I think, of anxiety.
p152
aV(Laughter) And they all operate at the same time.
p153
aa(lp154
VThere is also a big question of ambiguity.
p155
aVAnd I would link that to something called the cosmological constant.
p156
aVAnd you don't know what is operating, but something is operating there.
p157
aVAnd ambiguity, to me, is very uncomfortable
p158
aVin my life, and I have it. Moral ambiguity.
p159
aVIt is constantly there. And, just as an example,
p160
aVthis is one that recently came to me.
p161
aVIt was something I read in an editorial by a woman
p162
aVwho was talking about the war in Iraq. And she said,
p163
aV"Save a man from drowning, you are responsible to him for life."
p164
aVA very famous Chinese saying, she said.
p165
aVAnd that means because we went into Iraq, we should stay there
p166
aVuntil things were solved. You know, maybe even 100 years.
p167
aVSo, there was another one that I came across,
p168
aVand it's "saving fish from drowning."
p169
aVAnd it's what Buddhist fishermen say,
p170
aVbecause they're not supposed to kill anything.
p171
aVAnd they also have to make a living, and people need to be fed.
p172
aVSo their way of rationalizing that is they are saving the fish from drowning,
p173
aVand unfortunately, in the process the fish die.
p174
aa(lp175
VNow, what's encapsulated in both these drowning metaphors
p176
aV\u2014 actually, one of them is my mother's interpretation,
p177
aVand it is a famous Chinese saying, because she said it to me:
p178
aV"save a man from drowning, you are responsible to him for life."
p179
aVAnd it was a warning \u2014 don't get involved in other people's business,
p180
aVor you're going to get stuck.
p181
aVOK. I think if somebody really was drowning, she'd save them.
p182
aVBut, both of these sayings \u2014 saving a fish from drowning,
p183
aVor saving a man from drowning \u2014 to me they had to do with intentions.
p184
aa(lp185
VAnd all of us in life, when we see a situation, we have a response.
p186
aVAnd then we have intentions.
p187
aVThere's an ambiguity of what that should be that we should do,
p188
aVand then we do something.
p189
aVAnd the results of that may not match what our intentions had been.
p190
aVMaybe things go wrong. And so, after that, what are our responsibilities?
p191
aVWhat are we supposed to do?
p192
aVDo we stay in for life,
p193
aVor do we do something else and justify and say, well, my intentions were good,
p194
aVand therefore I cannot be held responsible for all of it?
p195
aVThat is the ambiguity in my life
p196
aVthat really disturbed me, and led me to write a book called
p197
aV"Saving Fish From Drowning."
p198
aa(lp199
VI saw examples of that. Once I identified this question, it was all over the place.
p200
aVI got these hints everywhere.
p201
aVAnd then, in a way, I knew that they had always been there.
p202
aVAnd then writing, that's what happens. I get these hints, these clues,
p203
aVand I realize that they've been obvious, and yet they have not been.
p204
aVAnd what I need, in effect, is a focus.
p205
aVAnd when I have the question, it is a focus.
p206
aVAnd all these things that seem to be flotsam and jetsam in life actually go through
p207
aVthat question, and what happens is those particular things become relevant.
p208
aVAnd it seems like it's happening all the time.
p209
aVYou think there's a sort of coincidence going on, a serendipity,
p210
aVin which you're getting all this help from the universe.
p211
aVAnd it may also be explained that now you have a focus.
p212
aVAnd you are noticing it more often.
p213
aa(lp214
VBut you apply this.
p215
aVYou begin to look at things having to do with your tensions.
p216
aVYour brother, who's fallen in trouble, do you take care of him?
p217
aVWhy or why not?
p218
aVIt may be something that is perhaps more serious
p219
aV\u2014 as I said, human rights in Burma.
p220
aVI was thinking that I shouldn't go because somebody said, if I did, it would show
p221
aVthat I approved of the military regime there.
p222
aVAnd then, after a while, I had to ask myself,
p223
aV"Why do we take on knowledge, why do we take on assumptions
p224
aVthat other people have given us?"
p225
aVAnd it was the same thing that I felt when I was growing up,
p226
aVand was hearing these rules of moral conduct from my father,
p227
aVwho was a Baptist minister.
p228
aVSo I decided that I would go to Burma for my own intentions,
p229
aVand still didn't know that if I went there,
p230
aVwhat the result of that would be, if I wrote a book \u2014
p231
aVand I just would have to face that later, when the time came.
p232
aa(lp233
VWe are all concerned with things that we see in the world that we are aware of.
p234
aVWe come to this point and say, what do I as an individual do?
p235
aVNot all of us can go to Africa, or work at hospitals,
p236
aVso what do we do, if we have this moral response, this feeling?
p237
aVAlso, I think one of the biggest things we are all looking at,
p238
aVand we talked about today, is genocide.
p239
aVThis leads to this question.
p240
aVWhen I look at all these things that are morally ambiguous and uncomfortable,
p241
aVand I consider what my intentions should be,
p242
aVI realize it goes back to this identity question that I had when I was a child
p243
aV\u2014 and why am I here, and what is the meaning of my life,
p244
aVand what is my place in the universe?
p245
aa(lp246
VIt seems so obvious, and yet it is not.
p247
aVWe all hate moral ambiguity in some sense,
p248
aVand yet it is also absolutely necessary.
p249
aVIn writing a story, it is the place where I begin.
p250
aVSometimes I get help from the universe, it seems.
p251
aVMy mother would say it was the ghost of my grandmother from the very first book,
p252
aVbecause it seemed I knew things I was not supposed to know.
p253
aVInstead of writing that the grandmother died accidentally,
p254
aVfrom an overdose of opium, while having too much of a good time,
p255
aVI actually put down in the story that the woman killed herself,
p256
aVand that actually was the way it happened.
p257
aVAnd my mother decided that that information must have come from my grandmother.
p258
aa(lp259
VThere are also things, quite uncanny,
p260
aVwhich bring me information that will help me in the writing of the book.
p261
aVIn this case, I was writing a story
p262
aVthat included some kind of detail, period of history, a certain location.
p263
aVAnd I needed to find something historically that would match that.
p264
aVAnd I took down this book, and I \u2014
p265
aVfirst page that I flipped it to was exactly the setting, and the time period,
p266
aVand the kind of character I needed \u2014 was the Taiping rebellion,
p267
aVhappening in the area near Guilin, outside of that,
p268
aVand a character who thought he was the son of God.
p269
aa(lp270
VYou wonder, are these things random chance?
p271
aVWell, what is random? What is chance? What is luck?
p272
aVWhat are things that you get from the universe that you can't really explain?
p273
aVAnd that goes into the story, too.
p274
aVThese are the things I constantly think about from day to day.
p275
aVEspecially when good things happen,
p276
aVand, in particular, when bad things happen.
p277
aVBut I do think there's a kind of serendipity,
p278
aVand I do want to know what those elements are,
p279
aVso I can thank them, and also try to find them in my life.
p280
aVBecause, again, I think that when I am aware of them, more of them happen.
p281
aa(lp282
VAnother chance encounter is when I went to a place
p283
aV\u2014 I just was with some friends, and we drove randomly to a different place,
p284
aVand we ended up in this non-tourist location,
p285
aVa beautiful village, pristine.
p286
aVAnd we walked three valleys beyond,
p287
aVand the third valley, there was something quite mysterious and ominous,
p288
aVa discomfort I felt. And then I knew that had to be [the] setting of my book.
p289
aVAnd in writing one of the scenes, it happened in that third valley.
p290
aVFor some reason I wrote about cairns \u2014 stacks of rocks \u2014 that a man was building.
p291
aVAnd I didn't know exactly why I had it, but it was so vivid.
p292
aVI got stuck, and a friend, when she asked if I would go for a walk with her dogs,
p293
aVthat I said, sure. And about 45 minutes later,
p294
aVwalking along the beach, I came across this.
p295
aVAnd it was a man, a Chinese man,
p296
aVand he was stacking these things, not with glue, not with anything.
p297
aVAnd I asked him, "How is it possible to do this?"
p298
aVAnd he said, "Well, I guess with everything in life, there's a place of balance."
p299
aVAnd this was exactly the meaning of my story at that point.
p300
aVI had so many examples \u2014 I have so many instances like this, when I'm writing a story,
p301
aVand I cannot explain it.
p302
aVIs it because I had the filter that I have such a strong coincidence
p303
aVin writing about these things?
p304
aVOr is it a kind of serendipity that we cannot explain, like the cosmological constant?
p305
aa(lp306
VA big thing that I also think about is accidents.
p307
aVAnd as I said, my mother did not believe in randomness.
p308
aVWhat is the nature of accidents?
p309
aVAnd how are we going to assign what the responsibility and the causes are,
p310
aVoutside of a court of law?
p311
aVI was able to see that in a firsthand way,
p312
aVwhen I went to beautiful Dong village, in Guizhou, the poorest province of China.
p313
aVAnd I saw this beautiful place. I knew I wanted to come back.
p314
aVAnd I had a chance to do that, when National Geographic asked me
p315
aVif I wanted to write anything about China.
p316
aVAnd I said yes, about this village of singing people, singing minority.
p317
aVAnd they agreed, and between the time I saw this place and the next time I went,
p318
aVthere was a terrible accident. A man, an old man, fell asleep,
p319
aVand his quilt dropped in a pan of fire that kept him warm.
p320
aV60 homes were destroyed, and 40 were damaged.
p321
aVResponsibility was assigned to the family.
p322
aVThe man's sons were banished to live three kilometers away, in a cowshed.
p323
aVAnd, of course, as Westerners, we say, "Well, it was an accident. That's not fair.
p324
aVIt's the son, not the father."
p325
aa(lp326
VWhen I go on a story, I have to let go of those kinds of beliefs.
p327
aVIt takes a while, but I have to let go of them and just go there, and be there.
p328
aVAnd so I was there on three occasions, different seasons.
p329
aVAnd I began to sense something different about the history,
p330
aVand what had happened before, and the nature of life in a very poor village,
p331
aVand what you find as your joys, and your rituals, your traditions, your links
p332
aVwith other families. And I saw how this had a kind of justice, in its responsibility.
p333
aVI was able to find out also about the ceremony that they were using,
p334
aVa ceremony they hadn't used in about 29 years. And it was to send some men
p335
aV\u2014 a Feng Shui master sent men down to the underworld on ghost horses.
p336
aVNow you, as Westerners, and I, as Westerners,
p337
aVwould say well, that's superstition. But after being there for a while,
p338
aVand seeing the amazing things that happened,
p339
aVyou begin to wonder whose beliefs are those that are in operation in the world,
p340
aVdetermining how things happen.
p341
aa(lp342
VSo I remained with them, and the more I wrote that story,
p343
aVthe more I got into those beliefs, and I think that's important for me
p344
aV\u2014 to take on the beliefs, because that is where the story is real,
p345
aVand that is where I'm gonna find the answers
p346
aVto how I feel about certain questions that I have in life.
p347
aVYears go by, of course, and the writing, it doesn't happen instantly,
p348
aVas I'm trying to convey it to you here at TED.
p349
aVThe book comes and it goes. When it arrives, it is no longer my book.
p350
aVIt is in the hands of readers, and they interpret it differently.
p351
aVBut I go back to this question of, how do I create something out of nothing?
p352
aVAnd how do I create my own life?
p353
aa(lp354
VAnd I think it is by questioning,
p355
aVand saying to myself that there are no absolute truths.
p356
aVI believe in specifics, the specifics of story,
p357
aVand the past, the specifics of that past,
p358
aVand what is happening in the story at that point.
p359
aVI also believe that in thinking about things \u2014
p360
aVmy thinking about luck, and fate, and coincidences and accidents,
p361
aVGod's will, and the synchrony of mysterious forces \u2014
p362
aVI will come to some notion of what that is, how we create.
p363
aVI have to think of my role. Where I am in the universe,
p364
aVand did somebody intend for me to be that way, or is it just something I came up with?
p365
aVAnd I also can find that by imagining fully, and becoming what is imagined \u2014
p366
aVand yet is in that real world, the fictional world.
p367
aVAnd that is how I find particles of truth, not the absolute truth, or the whole truth.
p368
aVAnd they have to be in all possibilities,
p369
aVincluding those I never considered before.
p370
aa(lp371
VSo, there are never complete answers.
p372
aVOr rather, if there is an answer, it is to remind
p373
aVmyself that there is uncertainty in everything,
p374
aVand that is good, because then I will discover something new.
p375
aVAnd if there is a partial answer, a more complete answer from me,
p376
aVit is to simply imagine.
p377
aVAnd to imagine is to put myself in that story,
p378
aVuntil there was only \u2014 there is a transparency between me and the story that I am creating.
p379
aa(lp380
VAnd that's how I've discovered that if I feel what is in the story
p381
aV\u2014 in one story \u2014 then I come the closest, I think,
p382
aVto knowing what compassion is, to feeling that compassion.
p383
