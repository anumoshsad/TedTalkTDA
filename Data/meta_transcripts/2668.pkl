VCybercrime is out of control.
p4
aVIt's everywhere.
p5
aVWe hear about it every single day.
p6
aVThis year,
p7
aVover two billion records lost or stolen.
p8
aVAnd last year, 100 million of us, mostly Americans,
p9
aVlost our health insurance data to thieves \u2014 myself included.
p10
aVWhat's particularly concerning about this is that in most cases,
p11
aVit was months before anyone even reported that these records were stolen.
p12
aa(lp13
VSo if you watch the evening news,
p14
aVyou would think that most of this is espionage or nation-state activity.
p15
aVAnd, well, some of it is.
p16
aVEspionage, you see, is an accepted international practice.
p17
aVBut in this case,
p18
aVit is only a small portion of the problem that we're dealing with.
p19
aVHow often do we hear about a breach
p20
aVfollowed by, "... it was the result of a sophisticated nation-state attack?"
p21
aVWell, often that is companies not being willing to own up
p22
aVto their own lackluster security practices.
p23
aVThere is also a widely held belief
p24
aVthat by blaming an attack on a nation-state,
p25
aVyou are putting regulators at bay \u2014
p26
aVat least for a period of time.
p27
aa(lp28
VSo where is all of this coming from?
p29
aVThe United Nations estimates that 80 percent of it
p30
aVis from highly organized and ultrasophisticated criminal gangs.
p31
aVTo date,
p32
aVthis represents one of the largest illegal economies in the world,
p33
aVtopping out at, now get this,
p34
aV445 billion dollars.
p35
aVLet me put that in perspective for all of you:
p36
aV445 billion dollars is larger than the GDP
p37
aVof 160 nations,
p38
aVincluding Ireland, Finland, Denmark and Portugal,
p39
aVto name a few.
p40
aa(lp41
VSo how does this work?
p42
aVHow do these criminals operate?
p43
aVWell, let me tell you a little story.
p44
aVAbout a year ago,
p45
aVour security researchers were tracking
p46
aVa somewhat ordinary but sophisticated banking Trojan called the Dyre Wolf.
p47
aVThe Dyre Wolf would get on your computer
p48
aVvia you clicking on a link in a phishing email
p49
aVthat you probably shouldn't have.
p50
aVIt would then sit and wait.
p51
aVIt would wait until you logged into your bank account.
p52
aVAnd when you did, the bad guys would reach in,
p53
aVsteal your credentials,
p54
aVand then use that to steal your money.
p55
aVThis sounds terrible,
p56
aVbut the reality is, in the security industry,
p57
aVthis form of attack is somewhat commonplace.
p58
aVHowever, the Dyre Wolf had two distinctly different personalities \u2014
p59
aVone for these small transactions,
p60
aVbut it took on an entirely different persona
p61
aVif you were in the business of moving large-scale wire transfers.
p62
aa(lp63
VHere's what would happen.
p64
aVYou start the process of issuing a wire transfer,
p65
aVand up in your browser would pop a screen from your bank,
p66
aVindicating that there's a problem with your account,
p67
aVand that you need to call the bank immediately,
p68
aValong with the number to the bank's fraud department.
p69
aVSo you pick up the phone and you call.
p70
aVAnd after going through the normal voice prompts,
p71
aVyou're met with an English-speaking operator.
p72
aV"Hello, Altoro Mutual Bank. How can I help you?"
p73
aVAnd you go through the process like you do every time you call your bank,
p74
aVof giving them your name and your account number,
p75
aVgoing through the security checks to verify you are who you said you are.
p76
aVMost of us may not know this,
p77
aVbut in many large-scale wire transfers,
p78
aVit requires two people to sign off on the wire transfer,
p79
aVso the operator then asks you to get the second person on the line,
p80
aVand goes through the same set of verifications and checks.
p81
aa(lp82
VSounds normal, right?
p83
aVOnly one problem:
p84
aVyou're not talking to the bank.
p85
aVYou're talking to the criminals.
p86
aVThey had built an English-speaking help desk,
p87
aVfake overlays to the banking website.
p88
aVAnd this was so flawlessly executed
p89
aVthat they were moving between a half a million
p90
aVand a million and a half dollars per attempt
p91
aVinto their criminal coffers.
p92
aa(lp93
VThese criminal organizations operate
p94
aVlike highly regimented, legitimate businesses.
p95
aVTheir employees work Monday through Friday.
p96
aVThey take the weekends off.
p97
aVHow do we know this?
p98
aVWe know this because our security researchers see
p99
aVrepeated spikes of malware on a Friday afternoon.
p100
aVThe bad guys, after a long weekend with the wife and kids,
p101
aVcome back in to see how well things went.
p102
aa(lp103
VThe Dark Web is where they spend their time.
p104
aVThat is a term used to describe the anonymous underbelly of the internet,
p105
aVwhere thieves can operate with anonymity
p106
aVand without detection.
p107
aVHere they peddle their attack software
p108
aVand share information on new attack techniques.
p109
aVYou can buy everything there,
p110
aVfrom a base-level attack to a much more advanced version.
p111
aVIn fact, in many cases, you even see
p112
aVgold, silver and bronze levels of service.
p113
aVYou can check references.
p114
aVYou can even buy attacks
p115
aVthat come with a money-back guarantee \u2014
p116
aa(lp117
V(Laughter)
p118
aa(lp119
Vif you're not successful.
p120
aVNow, these environments, these marketplaces \u2014
p121
aVthey look like an Amazon or an eBay.
p122
aVYou see products, prices, ratings and reviews.
p123
aVOf course, if you're going to buy an attack,
p124
aVyou're going to buy from a reputable criminal with good ratings, right?
p125
aa(lp126
V(Laughter)
p127
aa(lp128
VThis isn't any different
p129
aVthan checking on Yelp or TripAdvisor before going to a new restaurant.
p130
aVSo, here is an example.
p131
aVThis is an actual screenshot of a vendor selling malware.
p132
aVNotice they're a vendor level four,
p133
aVthey have a trust level of six.
p134
aVThey've had 400 positive reviews in the last year,
p135
aVand only two negative reviews in the last month.
p136
aVWe even see things like licensing terms.
p137
aVHere's an example of a site you can go to
p138
aVif you want to change your identity.
p139
aVThey will sell you a fake ID,
p140
aVfake passports.
p141
aVBut note the legally binding terms for purchasing your fake ID.
p142
aVGive me a break.
p143
aVWhat are they going to do \u2014 sue you if you violate them?
p144
aa(lp145
V(Laughter)
p146
aa(lp147
VThis occurred a couple of months ago.
p148
aVOne of our security researchers was looking
p149
aVat a new Android malware application that we had discovered.
p150
aVIt was called Bilal Bot.
p151
aVIn a blog post,
p152
aVshe positioned Bilal Bot as a new, inexpensive and beta alternative
p153
aVto the much more advanced GM Bot
p154
aVthat was commonplace in the criminal underground.
p155
aa(lp156
VThis review did not sit well with the authors of Bilal Bot.
p157
aVSo they wrote her this very email,
p158
aVpleading their case and making the argument
p159
aVthat they felt she had evaluated an older version.
p160
aVThey asked her to please update her blog with more accurate information
p161
aVand even offered to do an interview
p162
aVto describe to her in detail
p163
aVhow their attack software was now far better than the competition.
p164
aa(lp165
VSo look,
p166
aVyou don't have to like what they do,
p167
aVbut you do have to respect the entrepreneurial nature
p168
aVof their endeavors.
p169
aa(lp170
V(Laughter)
p171
aa(lp172
VSo how are we going to stop this?
p173
aVIt's not like we're going to be able to identify who's responsible \u2014
p174
aVremember, they operate with anonymity
p175
aVand outside the reach of the law.
p176
aVWe're certainly not going to be able to prosecute the offenders.
p177
aVI would propose that we need a completely new approach.
p178
aVAnd that approach needs to be centered on the idea
p179
aVthat we need to change the economics for the bad guys.
p180
aa(lp181
VAnd to give you a perspective on how this can work,
p182
aVlet's think of the response we see to a healthcare pandemic:
p183
aVSARS, Ebola, bird flu, Zika.
p184
aVWhat is the top priority?
p185
aVIt's knowing who is infected and how the disease is spreading.
p186
aVNow, governments, private institutions, hospitals, physicians \u2014
p187
aVeveryone responds openly and quickly.
p188
aVThis is a collective and altruistic effort
p189
aVto stop the spread in its tracks
p190
aVand to inform anyone not infected
p191
aVhow to protect or inoculate themselves.
p192
aa(lp193
VUnfortunately, this is not at all what we see in response to a cyber attack.
p194
aVOrganizations are far more likely to keep information on that attack
p195
aVto themselves.
p196
aVWhy?
p197
aVBecause they're worried about competitive advantage,
p198
aVlitigation
p199
aVor regulation.
p200
aVWe need to effectively democratize threat intelligence data.
p201
aVWe need to get all of these organizations to open up and share
p202
aVwhat is in their private arsenal of information.
p203
aVThe bad guys are moving fast;
p204
aVwe've got to move faster.
p205
aVAnd the best way to do that is to open up
p206
aVand share data on what's happening.
p207
aa(lp208
VLet's think about this in the construct of security professionals.
p209
aVRemember, they're programmed right into their DNA to keep secrets.
p210
aVWe've got to turn that thinking on its head.
p211
aVWe've got to get governments, private institutions
p212
aVand security companies
p213
aVwilling to share information at speed.
p214
aVAnd here's why:
p215
aVbecause if you share the information,
p216
aVit's equivalent to inoculation.
p217
aVAnd if you're not sharing,
p218
aVyou're actually part of the problem,
p219
aVbecause you're increasing the odds that other people could be impacted
p220
aVby the same attack techniques.
p221
aa(lp222
VBut there's an even bigger benefit.
p223
aVBy destroying criminals' devices closer to real time,
p224
aVwe break their plans.
p225
aVWe inform the people they aim to hurt
p226
aVfar sooner than they had ever anticipated.
p227
aVWe ruin their reputations,
p228
aVwe crush their ratings and reviews.
p229
aVWe make cybercrime not pay.
p230
aVWe change the economics for the bad guys.
p231
aVBut to do this, a first mover was required \u2014
p232
aVsomeone to change the thinking in the security industry overall.
p233
aa(lp234
VAbout a year ago,
p235
aVmy colleagues and I had a radical idea.
p236
aVWhat if IBM were to take our data \u2014
p237
aVwe had one of the largest threat intelligence databases in the world \u2014
p238
aVand open it up?
p239
aVIt had information not just on what had happened in the past,
p240
aVbut what was happening in near-real time.
p241
aVWhat if we were to publish it all openly on the internet?
p242
aVAs you can imagine, this got quite a reaction.
p243
aVFirst came the lawyers:
p244
aVWhat are the legal implications of doing that?
p245
aVThen came the business:
p246
aVWhat are the business implications of doing that?
p247
aVAnd this was also met with a good dose
p248
aVof a lot of people just asking if we were completely crazy.
p249
aa(lp250
VBut there was one conversation that kept floating to the surface
p251
aVin every dialogue that we would have:
p252
aVthe realization that if we didn't do this,
p253
aVthen we were part of the problem.
p254
aVSo we did something unheard of in the security industry.
p255
aVWe started publishing.
p256
aVOver 700 terabytes of actionable threat intelligence data,
p257
aVincluding information on real-time attacks
p258
aVthat can be used to stop cybercrime in its tracks.
p259
aVAnd to date,
p260
aVover 4,000 organizations are leveraging this data,
p261
aVincluding half of the Fortune 100.
p262
aVAnd our hope as a next step is to get all of those organizations
p263
aVto join us in the fight,
p264
aVand do the same thing
p265
aVand share their information
p266
aVon when and how they're being attacked as well.
p267
aa(lp268
VWe all have the opportunity to stop it,
p269
aVand we already all know how.
p270
aVAll we have to do is look to the response that we see
p271
aVin the world of health care,
p272
aVand how they respond to a pandemic.
p273
aVSimply put,
p274
aVwe need to be open and collaborative.
p275
aa(lp276
VThank you.
