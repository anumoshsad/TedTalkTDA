VIt was April 8, 2003.
p4
aVI was in Baghdad, covering the war in Iraq.
p5
aVThat day, Americans tanks started arriving in Baghdad.
p6
aVWe were just a few journalists in the Palestine Hotel,
p7
aVand, as happens in war,
p8
aVthe fighting began to approach outside our windows.
p9
aVBaghdad was covered in black smoke and oil.
p10
aVIt smelled awful.
p11
aVWe couldn't see a thing, but we knew what was happening.
p12
aa(lp13
VOf course, I was supposed to be writing an article,
p14
aVbut that's how it always goes \u2014
p15
aVyou're supposed to be writing and something big happens.
p16
aVSo I was in my room on the 16th floor,
p17
aVwriting and looking out the window every now and then
p18
aVto see what was happening.
p19
aVSuddenly, there was a huge explosion.
p20
aVDuring the previous three weeks,
p21
aVthere had been shelling with half-ton missiles,
p22
aVbut this time, the shock \u2014
p23
aVI felt it inside of me,
p24
aVand I thought, "It's very close.
p25
aVIt's very, very close."
p26
aa(lp27
VSo I went down to see what was happening.
p28
aVI went down to the 15th floor
p29
aVto take a look.
p30
aVAnd I saw people, journalists, screaming in the hallways.
p31
aVI walked into a room
p32
aVand realized that it had been hit by a missile.
p33
aVSomeone had been wounded.
p34
aVThere was a man near the window,
p35
aVa cameraman named Taras Protsyuk,
p36
aVlying face-down.
p37
aVHaving worked in a hospital before, I wanted to help out.
p38
aVSo I turned him over.
p39
aVAnd when I turned him over,
p40
aVI noticed that he was open from sternum to pubis,
p41
aVbut I couldn't see anything, nothing at all.
p42
aVAll I saw was a white, pearly, shiny spot that blinded me,
p43
aVand I didn't understand what was going on.
p44
aa(lp45
VOnce the spot disappeared and I could see his wound,
p46
aVwhich was very serious,
p47
aVmy buddies and I put a sheet underneath him,
p48
aVand we carried him onto an elevator that stopped at each of the 15 floors.
p49
aVWe put him in a car that took him to the hospital.
p50
aVHe died on the way to the hospital.
p51
aVThe Spanish cameraman José Couso, who was on the 14th floor and also hit \u2014
p52
aVbecause the shell had exploded between the two floors \u2014
p53
aVdied on the operating table.
p54
aVAs soon as the car left, I went back.
p55
aVThere was that article I was supposed to write \u2014
p56
aVwhich I had to write.
p57
aa(lp58
VAnd so \u2014
p59
aVI returned to the hotel lobby with my arms covered in blood,
p60
aVwhen one of the hotel gofers stopped me
p61
aVand asked me to pay the tax I hadn't paid for 10 days.
p62
aVI told him to get lost.
p63
aVAnd I said to myself: "Clear your head, put it all aside.
p64
aVIf you want to write, you need to put it all aside."
p65
aVAnd that's what I did.
p66
aVI went upstairs, wrote my article and sent it off.
p67
aa(lp68
VLater, aside from the feeling of having lost my colleagues,
p69
aVsomething else was bothering me.
p70
aVI kept seeing that shiny, pearly spot,
p71
aVand I couldn't understand what it meant.
p72
aVAnd then, the war was over.
p73
aa(lp74
VLater, I thought: "That's not possible. I can't just not know what happened."
p75
aVBecause it wasn't the first time, and it didn't only happen to me.
p76
aVI have seen things like that happen to others
p77
aVin my 20 to 35 years of reporting.
p78
aVI have seen things that had an effect on me too.
p79
aVFor example, there was this man I knew in Lebanon,
p80
aVa 25-year-old veteran who had been fighting for five years \u2014
p81
aVa real veteran \u2014 who we would follow everywhere.
p82
aVHe would crawl in the dark with confidence \u2014
p83
aVhe was a great soldier, a true soldier \u2014
p84
aVso we would follow him, knowing that we would be safe with him.
p85
aVAnd one day, as I was told \u2014
p86
aVand I've seen him again since \u2014
p87
aVhe was back in the camp, playing cards,
p88
aVwhen someone came in next door,
p89
aVand discharged their weapon.
p90
aVAs the gun went off,
p91
aVthat blast, that one shot, made him duck quickly under the table,
p92
aVlike a child.
p93
aVHe was shaking, panicking.
p94
aVAnd since then, he has never been able to get up and fight.
p95
aVHe ended up working as a croupier
p96
aVin a Beirut casino where I later found him,
p97
aVbecause he couldn't sleep, so it was quite a suitable job.
p98
aa(lp99
VSo I thought to myself,
p100
aV"What is this thing that can kill you
p101
aVwithout leaving any visible scars?
p102
aVHow does that happen?
p103
aVWhat is this unknown thing?"
p104
aVIt was too common to be coincidental.
p105
aa(lp106
VSo I started to investigate \u2014
p107
aVthat's all I know how to do.
p108
aVI started to investigate
p109
aVby looking through books,
p110
aVreaching out to psychiatrists,
p111
aVgoing to museums, libraries, etc.
p112
aVFinally, I discovered that some people knew about this \u2014
p113
aVoften military psychiatrists \u2014
p114
aVand that what we were dealing with was called trauma.
p115
aVAmericans call it PTSD or traumatic neurosis.
p116
aVIt was something
p117
aVthat existed,
p118
aVbut that we never spoke about.
p119
aa(lp120
VSo, this trauma \u2014
p121
aVwhat is it?
p122
aVWell, it's an encounter with death.
p123
aVI don't know if you've ever had an experience with death \u2014
p124
aVI'm not talking about dead bodies,
p125
aVor someone's grandfather lying in a hospital bed,
p126
aVor someone who got hit by a car.
p127
aVI'm talking about facing the void of death.
p128
aVAnd that is something no one is supposed to see.
p129
aVPeople used to say,
p130
aV"Neither the sun, nor death can be looked at with a steady eye."
p131
aVA human being should not have to face the void of death.
p132
aa(lp133
VBut when that happens,
p134
aVit can remain invisible for a while \u2014
p135
aVdays, weeks, months, sometimes years.
p136
aVAnd then, at some point,
p137
aVit explodes,
p138
aVbecause it's something that has entered your brain \u2014
p139
aVa sort of window between an image and your mind \u2014
p140
aVthat has penetrated your brain,
p141
aVstaying there and taking up all the space inside.
p142
aVAnd there are people \u2014 men, women,
p143
aVwho suddenly no longer sleep.
p144
aVAnd they experience horrible anxiety attacks \u2014
p145
aVpanic attacks, not just minor fears.
p146
aVThey suddenly don't want to sleep,
p147
aVbecause when they do, they have the same nightmare every night.
p148
aVThey see the same image every night.
p149
aVWhat type of image?
p150
aVFor example, a soldier who enters a building
p151
aVand comes face to face with another soldier aiming at him.
p152
aVHe looks at the gun, straight down the barrel.
p153
aVAnd this barrel suddenly becomes enormous, deformed.
p154
aVIt becomes fluffy, swallowing everything.
p155
aVAnd he says \u2014
p156
aVlater he will say, "I saw death.
p157
aVI saw myself dead, therefore I'm dead."
p158
aVAnd from then on, he knows he is dead.
p159
aVIt is not a perception \u2014 he is convinced that he is dead.
p160
aVIn reality, someone came in, the guy left or didn't shoot, whatever,
p161
aVand he didn't actually get shot \u2014
p162
aVbut to him, he died in that moment.
p163
aVOr it can be the smell of a mass grave \u2014
p164
aVI saw a lot of that in Rwanda.
p165
aVIt can be the voice of a friend calling,
p166
aVand they're being slaughtered and there's nothing you can do.
p167
aVYou hear that voice,
p168
aVand you wake up every night \u2014 for weeks, months \u2014
p169
aVin a trance-like state, anxious and terrified,
p170
aVlike a child.
p171
aVI have seen men cry \u2014
p172
aVjust like children \u2014
p173
aVfrom seeing the same image.
p174
aa(lp175
VSo having that image of horror in your brain,
p176
aVseeing the void of death \u2014
p177
aVthat analogue of horror which is hiding something \u2014
p178
aVwill completely take over.
p179
aVYou cannot do anything, anything at all.
p180
aVYou cannot work anymore,
p181
aVyou cannot love anymore.
p182
aVYou go home and don't recognize anyone.
p183
aVYou don't even recognize yourself.
p184
aVYou hide and don't leave the house, you lock yourself in, you become ill.
p185
aVI know people who placed small cans outside their house with coins inside,
p186
aVin case someone tried to get in.
p187
aVAll of a sudden, you feel like you want to die or kill
p188
aVor hide or run away.
p189
aVYou want to be loved, but you hate everyone.
p190
aVIt's a feeling that seizes you entirely
p191
aVday in and day out,
p192
aVand you suffer tremendously.
p193
aVAnd no one understands.
p194
aVThey say, "There's nothing wrong with you. You seem fine, you have no injuries.
p195
aVYou went to war, came back; you're fine."
p196
aVThese people suffer tremendously.
p197
aVSome commit suicide.
p198
aVAfter all, suicide is like updating your daily planner \u2014
p199
aVI'm already dead, I might as well commit suicide.
p200
aVPlus, there is no more pain.
p201
aVSome commit suicide, others end up under the bridge, drinking.
p202
aVEveryone remembers that grandfather or uncle or neighbor
p203
aVwho used to drink, never said a word,
p204
aValways in a bad mood, beat his wife
p205
aVand who would end up either sinking into alcoholism or dying.
p206
aa(lp207
VAnd why do we not talk about this?
p208
aVWe don't talk about it because it's taboo.
p209
aVIt's not like we don't have the words to express the void of death.
p210
aVBut others don't want hear it.
p211
aVThe first time I returned from an assignment,
p212
aVThey said, "Oh! He's back."
p213
aVThere was a fancy dinner \u2014 white tablecloth, candles, guests.
p214
aV"Tell us everything!"
p215
aVWhich I did.
p216
aVAfter 20 minutes, people were giving me dirty looks,
p217
aVthe hostess had her nose in the ashtray.
p218
aVIt was horrible and I realized I ruined the whole evening.
p219
aVSo I don't talk about it anymore.
p220
aVWe're just not ready to listen.
p221
aVPeople say outright: "Please, stop."
p222
aa(lp223
VIs that a rare occurrence?
p224
aVNo, it's extremely common.
p225
aVOne third of the soldiers who died in Iraq \u2014
p226
aVwell, not "died," let me re-phrase that \u2014
p227
aVone third of the US soldiers who went to Iraq
p228
aVsuffer from PTSD.
p229
aVIn 1939, there were still 200,000 soldiers from the First World War
p230
aVthat were being treated in British psychiatric hospitals.
p231
aVIn Vietnam, 54,000 people died \u2014
p232
aVAmericans.
p233
aVIn 1987, the US government identified 102,000 \u2014
p234
aVtwice as many \u2014
p235
aV102,000 veterans who died from committing suicide.
p236
aVTwice as many deaths by suicide than by combat in Vietnam.
p237
aVSo you see, this relates to everything,
p238
aVnot just modern warfare, but also ancient wars \u2014
p239
aVyou can read about it, the evidence is there.
p240
aVSo why do we not talk about it?
p241
aVWhy have we not talked about it?
p242
aVThe problem is that if you don't talk about it,
p243
aVyou're heading for disaster.
p244
aa(lp245
VThe only way to heal \u2014
p246
aVand the good news here is that this is treatable \u2014
p247
aVthink Munch's The Scream, Goya, etc. \u2014
p248
aVit's indeed treatable.
p249
aVThe only way to heal from this trauma,
p250
aVfrom this encounter with death that overwhelms, petrifies and kills you
p251
aVis to find a way to express it.
p252
aa(lp253
VPeople used to say,
p254
aV"Language is the only thing that holds all of us together."
p255
aVWithout language, we're nothing.
p256
aVIt's the thing that makes us human.
p257
aVIn the face of such a horrible image \u2014
p258
aVa wordless image of oblivion that obsesses us \u2014
p259
aVthe only way to cope with it
p260
aVis to put human words to it.
p261
aVBecause these people feel excluded from humanity.
p262
aVNo one wants to see them anymore and they don't want to see anyone.
p263
aVThey feel dirty, defiled, ashamed.
p264
aVSomeone said, "Doctor, I don't use the subway anymore
p265
aVbecause I'm afraid people will see the horror in my eyes."
p266
aVAnother guy thought he had a terrible skin disease
p267
aVand spent six months with dermatologists, going from doctor to doctor.
p268
aVAnd then one day, they sent him to a psychiatrist.
p269
aVDuring his second session, he told the psychiatrist
p270
aVhe had a terrible skin disease from head to toe.
p271
aVThe psychiatrist asked, "Why are you in this state?"
p272
aVAnd the man said, "Well, because I'm dead, so I must be rotting away."
p273
aa(lp274
VSo you see this is something that has a profound effect on people.
p275
aVIn order to heal, we need to talk about it.
p276
aVThe horror needs to be put into words \u2014
p277
aVhuman words, so we can organize it and talk about it again.
p278
aVWe have to look death in the face.
p279
aVAnd if we can do that, if we can talk about these things,
p280
aVthen step by step, by working it out verbally,
p281
aVwe can reclaim our place in humanity.
p282
aVAnd it is important.
p283
aVSilence kills us.
p284
aa(lp285
VSo what does this mean?
p286
aVIt means that after a trauma,
p287
aVwithout question, we lose our "unbearable lightness of being,"
p288
aVthat sense of immortality that keeps us here \u2014
p289
aVmeaning, if we're here, we almost feel like we're immortal, which we're not,
p290
aVbut if we didn't believe that, we'd say, "What's the point of it all?"
p291
aVBut trauma survivors have lost that feeling of immortality.
p292
aVThey've lost their lightness.
p293
aVBut they have found something else.
p294
aVSo this means that if we manage to look death in the face,
p295
aVand actually confront it, rather than keep quiet and hide,
p296
aVlike some of the men or women I know did,
p297
aVsuch as Michael from Rwanda, Carole from Iraq, Philippe from the Congo
p298
aVand other people I know,
p299
aVlike Sorj Chalandon, now a great writer,
p300
aVwho gave up field assignments after a trauma.
p301
aVFive friends of mine committed suicide,
p302
aVthey're the ones who did not survive the trauma.
p303
aa(lp304
VSo if we can look death in the face,
p305
aVif we, mortal humans, human mortals,
p306
aVunderstand that we are human and mortal, mortal and human,
p307
aVif we can confront death and identify it once again
p308
aVas the most mysterious place of all mysterious places,
p309
aVsince no one has ever seen it \u2014
p310
aVif we can give it back this meaning,
p311
aVyes, we may die,
p312
aVsurvive
p313
aVand come back to life,
p314
aVbut we'll come back stronger than before.
p315
aVMuch stronger.
p316
