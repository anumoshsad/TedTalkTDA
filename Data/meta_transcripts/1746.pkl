VThere's something that I'd like you to see.
p4
aa(lp5
V(Video) Reporter: It's a story that's deeply unsettled
p6
aVmillions in China:
p7
aVfootage of a two-year-old girl
p8
aVhit by a van and left bleeding in the street by passersby,
p9
aVfootage too graphic to be shown.
p10
aVThe entire accident is caught on camera.
p11
aVThe driver pauses after hitting the child,
p12
aVhis back wheels seen resting on her for over a second.
p13
aVWithin two minutes, three people pass two-year-old Wang Yue by.
p14
aVThe first walks around the badly injured toddler completely.
p15
aVOthers look at her before moving off.
p16
aa(lp17
VPeter Singer: There were other people
p18
aVwho walked past Wang Yue,
p19
aVand a second van ran over her legs
p20
aVbefore a street cleaner raised the alarm.
p21
aVShe was rushed to hospital, but it was too late. She died.
p22
aa(lp23
VI wonder how many of you, looking at that,
p24
aVsaid to yourselves just now, "I would not have done that.
p25
aVI would have stopped to help."
p26
aVRaise your hands if that thought occurred to you.
p27
aa(lp28
VAs I thought, that's most of you.
p29
aVAnd I believe you. I'm sure you're right.
p30
aVBut before you give yourself too much credit,
p31
aVlook at this.
p32
aVUNICEF reports that in 2011,
p33
aV6.9 million children under five
p34
aVdied from preventable, poverty-related diseases.
p35
aVUNICEF thinks that that's good news
p36
aVbecause the figure has been steadily coming down
p37
aVfrom 12 million in 1990. That is good.
p38
aVBut still, 6.9 million
p39
aVis 19,000 children dying every day.
p40
aVDoes it really matter
p41
aVthat we're not walking past them in the street?
p42
aVDoes it really matter that they're far away?
p43
aVI don't think it does make a morally relevant difference.
p44
aVThe fact that they're not right in front of us,
p45
aVthe fact, of course, that they're of a different nationality
p46
aVor race, none of that seems morally relevant to me.
p47
aVWhat is really important is,
p48
aVcan we reduce that death toll? Can we save
p49
aVsome of those 19,000 children dying every day?
p50
aa(lp51
VAnd the answer is, yes we can.
p52
aVEach of us spends money
p53
aVon things that we do not really need.
p54
aVYou can think what your own habit is,
p55
aVwhether it's a new car, a vacation
p56
aVor just something like buying bottled water
p57
aVwhen the water that comes out of the tap
p58
aVis perfectly safe to drink.
p59
aVYou could take the money you're spending
p60
aVon those unnecessary things
p61
aVand give it to this organization,
p62
aVthe Against Malaria Foundation,
p63
aVwhich would take the money you had given
p64
aVand use it to buy nets like this one
p65
aVto protect children like this one,
p66
aVand we know reliably that if we provide nets,
p67
aVthey're used, and they reduce the number of children
p68
aVdying from malaria,
p69
aVjust one of the many preventable diseases
p70
aVthat are responsible for some of those 19,000 children
p71
aVdying every day.
p72
aa(lp73
VFortunately, more and more people
p74
aVare understanding this idea,
p75
aVand the result is a growing movement:
p76
aVeffective altruism.
p77
aVIt's important because it combines both the heart and the head.
p78
aVThe heart, of course, you felt.
p79
aVYou felt the empathy for that child.
p80
aVBut it's really important to use the head as well
p81
aVto make sure that what you do is effective and well-directed,
p82
aVand not only that, but also I think reason helps us
p83
aVto understand that other people, wherever they are,
p84
aVare like us, that they can suffer as we can,
p85
aVthat parents grieve for the deaths of their children,
p86
aVas we do,
p87
aVand that just as our lives and our well-being matter to us,
p88
aVit matters just as much to all of these people.
p89
aVSo I think reason is not just some neutral tool
p90
aVto help you get whatever you want.
p91
aVIt does help us to put perspective on our situation.
p92
aVAnd I think that's why
p93
aVmany of the most significant people in effective altruism
p94
aVhave been people who have had backgrounds
p95
aVin philosophy or economics or math.
p96
aVAnd that might seem surprising,
p97
aVbecause a lot of people think,
p98
aV"Philosophy is remote from the real world;
p99
aVeconomics, we're told, just makes us more selfish,
p100
aVand we know that math is for nerds."
p101
aVBut in fact it does make a difference,
p102
aVand in fact there's one particular nerd
p103
aVwho has been a particularly effective altruist
p104
aVbecause he got this.
p105
aa(lp106
VThis is the website of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation,
p107
aVand if you look at the words on the top right-hand side,
p108
aVit says, "All lives have equal value."
p109
aVThat's the understanding,
p110
aVthe rational understanding of our situation in the world
p111
aVthat has led to these people
p112
aVbeing the most effective altruists in history,
p113
aVBill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett.
p114
aa(lp115
V(Applause)
p116
aa(lp117
VNo one, not Andrew Carnegie, not John D. Rockefeller,
p118
aVhas ever given as much to charity
p119
aVas each one of these three,
p120
aVand they have used their intelligence
p121
aVto make sure that it is highly effective.
p122
aVAccording to one estimate, the Gates Foundation
p123
aVhas already saved 5.8 million lives
p124
aVand many millions more, people, getting diseases
p125
aVthat would have made them very sick,
p126
aVeven if eventually they survived.
p127
aVOver the coming years, undoubtably the Gates Foundation
p128
aVis going to give a lot more,
p129
aVis going to save a lot more lives.
p130
aVWell, you might say, that's fine if you're a billionaire,
p131
aVyou can have that kind of impact.
p132
aVBut if I'm not, what can I do?
p133
aVSo I'm going to look at four questions that people ask
p134
aVthat maybe stand in the way of them giving.
p135
aa(lp136
VThey worry how much of a difference they can make.
p137
aVBut you don't have to be a billionaire.
p138
aVThis is Toby Ord. He's a research fellow in philosophy
p139
aVat the University of Oxford.
p140
aVHe became an effective altruist when he calculated
p141
aVthat with the money that he was likely to earn
p142
aVthroughout his career, an academic career,
p143
aVhe could give enough to cure 80,000 people of blindness
p144
aVin developing countries
p145
aVand still have enough left
p146
aVfor a perfectly adequate standard of living.
p147
aVSo Toby founded an organization
p148
aVcalled Giving What We Can to spread this information,
p149
aVto unite people who want to share some of their income,
p150
aVand to ask people to pledge to give 10 percent
p151
aVof what they earn over their lifetime
p152
aVto fighting global poverty.
p153
aVToby himself does better than that.
p154
aVHe's pledged to live on 18,000 pounds a year \u2014
p155
aVthat's less than 30,000 dollars \u2014
p156
aVand to give the rest to those organizations.
p157
aVAnd yes, Toby is married and he does have a mortgage.
p158
aa(lp159
VThis is a couple at a later stage of life,
p160
aVCharlie Bresler and Diana Schott,
p161
aVwho, when they were young, when they met,
p162
aVwere activists against the Vietnam War,
p163
aVfought for social justice,
p164
aVand then moved into careers, as most people do,
p165
aVdidn't really do anything very active about those values,
p166
aValthough they didn't abandon them.
p167
aVAnd then, as they got to the age at which many people
p168
aVstart to think of retirement, they returned to them,
p169
aVand they've decided to cut back on their spending,
p170
aVto live modestly, and to give both money and time
p171
aVto helping to fight global poverty.
p172
aa(lp173
VNow, mentioning time might lead you to think,
p174
aV"Well, should I abandon my career and put all of my time
p175
aVinto saving some of these 19,000 lives
p176
aVthat are lost every day?"
p177
aVOne person who's thought quite a bit about this issue
p178
aVof how you can have a career that will have
p179
aVthe biggest impact for good in the world is Will Crouch.
p180
aVHe's a graduate student in philosophy,
p181
aVand he's set up a website called 80,000 Hours,
p182
aVthe number of hours he estimates
p183
aVmost people spend on their career,
p184
aVto advise people on how to have the best,
p185
aVmost effective career.
p186
aVBut you might be surprised to know
p187
aVthat one of the careers that he encourages people to consider,
p188
aVif they have the right abilities and character,
p189
aVis to go into banking or finance.
p190
aVWhy? Because if you earn a lot of money,
p191
aVyou can give away a lot of money,
p192
aVand if you're successful in that career,
p193
aVyou could give enough to an aid organization
p194
aVso that it could employ, let's say, five aid workers
p195
aVin developing countries, and each one of them
p196
aVwould probably do about as much good
p197
aVas you would have done.
p198
aVSo you can quintuple the impact
p199
aVby leading that kind of career.
p200
aVHere's one young man who's taken this advice.
p201
aVHis name is Matt Weiger.
p202
aVHe was a student at Princeton in philosophy and math,
p203
aVactually won the prize for the best undergraduate philosophy thesis
p204
aVlast year when he graduated.
p205
aVBut he's gone into finance in New York.
p206
aVHe's already earning enough
p207
aVso that he's giving a six-figure sum to effective charities
p208
aVand still leaving himself with enough to live on.
p209
aVMatt has also helped me to set up an organization
p210
aVthat I'm working with that has the name taken
p211
aVfrom the title of a book I wrote,
p212
aV"The Life You Can Save,"
p213
aVwhich is trying to change our culture
p214
aVso that more people think that
p215
aVif we're going to live an ethical life,
p216
aVit's not enough just to follow the thou-shalt-nots
p217
aVand not cheat, steal, maim, kill,
p218
aVbut that if we have enough, we have to share some of that
p219
aVwith people who have so little.
p220
aVAnd the organization draws together people
p221
aVof different generations,
p222
aVlike Holly Morgan, who's an undergraduate,
p223
aVwho's pledged to give 10 percent
p224
aVof the little amount that she has,
p225
aVand on the right, Ada Wan,
p226
aVwho has worked directly for the poor, but has now
p227
aVgone to Yale to do an MBA to have more to give.
p228
aa(lp229
VMany people will think, though,
p230
aVthat charities aren't really all that effective.
p231
aVSo let's talk about effectiveness.
p232
aVToby Ord is very concerned about this,
p233
aVand he's calculated that some charities
p234
aVare hundreds or even thousands of times
p235
aVmore effective than others,
p236
aVso it's very important to find the effective ones.
p237
aVTake, for example, providing a guide dog for a blind person.
p238
aVThat's a good thing to do, right?
p239
aVWell, right, it is a good thing to do,
p240
aVbut you have to think what else you could do with the resources.
p241
aVIt costs about 40,000 dollars to train a guide dog
p242
aVand train the recipient so that the guide dog
p243
aVcan be an effective help to a blind person.
p244
aVIt costs somewhere between 20 and 50 dollars
p245
aVto cure a blind person in a developing country
p246
aVif they have trachoma.
p247
aVSo you do the sums, and you get something like that.
p248
aVYou could provide one guide dog
p249
aVfor one blind American,
p250
aVor you could cure between 400
p251
aVand 2,000 people of blindness.
p252
aVI think it's clear what's the better thing to do.
p253
aVBut if you want to look for effective charities,
p254
aVthis is a good website to go to.
p255
aVGiveWell exists to really assess the impact of charities,
p256
aVnot just whether they're well-run,
p257
aVand it's screened hundreds of charities
p258
aVand currently is recommending only three,
p259
aVof which the Against Malaria Foundation is number one.
p260
aVSo it's very tough. If you want to look for other recommendations,
p261
aVthelifeyoucansave.com and Giving What We Can
p262
aVboth have a somewhat broader list,
p263
aVbut you can find effective organizations,
p264
aVand not just in the area of saving lives from the poor.
p265
aVI'm pleased to say that there is now also a website
p266
aVlooking at effective animal organizations.
p267
aVThat's another cause that I've been concerned about
p268
aVall my life, the immense amount of suffering
p269
aVthat humans inflict
p270
aVon literally tens of billions of animals every year.
p271
aVSo if you want to look for effective organizations
p272
aVto reduce that suffering,
p273
aVyou can go to Effective Animal Activism.
p274
aVAnd some effective altruists think it's very important
p275
aVto make sure that our species survives at all.
p276
aVSo they're looking at ways to reduce the risk of extinction.
p277
aVHere's one risk of extinction that we all became aware of
p278
aVrecently, when an asteroid passed close to our planet.
p279
aVPossibly research could help us not only to predict
p280
aVthe path of asteroids that might collide with us,
p281
aVbut actually to deflect them.
p282
aVSo some people think that would be a good thing to give to.
p283
aVThere's many possibilities.
p284
aa(lp285
VMy final question is,
p286
aVsome people will think it's a burden to give.
p287
aVI don't really believe it is.
p288
aVI've enjoyed giving all of my life
p289
aVsince I was a graduate student.
p290
aVIt's been something fulfilling to me.
p291
aVCharlie Bresler said to me that he's not an altruist.
p292
aVHe thinks that the life he's saving is his own.
p293
aVAnd Holly Morgan told me that she used to battle depression
p294
aVuntil she got involved with effective altruism,
p295
aVand now is one of the happiest people she knows.
p296
aVI think one of the reasons for this
p297
aVis that being an effective altruist helps to overcome
p298
aVwhat I call the Sisyphus problem.
p299
aVHere's Sisyphus as portrayed by Titian,
p300
aVcondemned by the gods to push a huge boulder
p301
aVup to the top of the hill.
p302
aVJust as he gets there, the effort becomes too much,
p303
aVthe boulder escapes, rolls all the way down the hill,
p304
aVhe has to trudge back down to push it up again,
p305
aVand the same thing happens again and again
p306
aVfor all eternity.
p307
aVDoes that remind you of a consumer lifestyle,
p308
aVwhere you work hard to get money,
p309
aVyou spend that money on consumer goods
p310
aVwhich you hope you'll enjoy using?
p311
aVBut then the money's gone, you have to work hard
p312
aVto get more, spend more, and to maintain
p313
aVthe same level of happiness, it's kind of a hedonic treadmill.
p314
aVYou never get off, and you never really feel satisfied.
p315
aVBecoming an effective altruist gives you
p316
aVthat meaning and fulfillment.
p317
aVIt enables you to have a solid basis for self-esteem
p318
aVon which you can feel your life was really worth living.
p319
aa(lp320
VI'm going to conclude by telling you
p321
aVabout an email that I received
p322
aVwhile I was writing this talk just a month or so ago.
p323
aVIt's from a man named Chris Croy, who I'd never heard of.
p324
aVThis is a picture of him showing him recovering from surgery.
p325
aVWhy was he recovering from surgery?
p326
aa(lp327
VThe email began, "Last Tuesday,
p328
aVI anonymously donated my right kidney to a stranger.
p329
aVThat started a kidney chain
p330
aVwhich enabled four people to receive kidneys."
p331
aa(lp332
VThere's about 100 people each year in the U.S.
p333
aVand more in other countries who do that.
p334
aVI was pleased to read it. Chris went on to say
p335
aVthat he'd been influenced by my writings in what he did.
p336
aVWell, I have to admit, I'm also somewhat embarrassed by that,
p337
aVbecause I still have two kidneys.
p338
aVBut Chris went on to say that he didn't think
p339
aVthat what he'd done was all that amazing,
p340
aVbecause he calculated that the number of life-years
p341
aVthat he had added to people, the extension of life,
p342
aVwas about the same that you could achieve
p343
aVif you gave 5,000 dollars to the Against Malaria Foundation.
p344
aVAnd that did make me feel a little bit better,
p345
aVbecause I have given more than 5,000 dollars
p346
aVto the Against Malaria Foundation
p347
aVand to various other effective charities.
p348
aa(lp349
VSo if you're feeling bad
p350
aVbecause you still have two kidneys as well,
p351
aVthere's a way for you to get off the hook.
p352
aa(lp353
VThank you.
