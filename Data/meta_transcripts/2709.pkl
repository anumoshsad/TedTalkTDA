VToday I want to talk about the meaning of words,
p4
aVhow we define them
p5
aVand how they, almost as revenge,
p6
aVdefine us.
p7
aa(lp8
VThe English language is a magnificent sponge.
p9
aVI love the English language. I'm glad that I speak it.
p10
aVBut for all that, it has a lot of holes.
p11
aVIn Greek, there's a word, "lachesism"
p12
aVwhich is the hunger for disaster.
p13
aVYou know, when you see a thunderstorm on the horizon
p14
aVand you just find yourself rooting for the storm.
p15
aVIn Mandarin, they have a word "yù y\u012b" \u2014
p16
aVI'm not pronouncing that correctly \u2014
p17
aVwhich means the longing to feel intensely again
p18
aVthe way you did when you were a kid.
p19
aVIn Polish, they have a word "jouska"
p20
aVwhich is the kind of hypothetical conversation
p21
aVthat you compulsively play out in your head.
p22
aVAnd finally, in German, of course in German,
p23
aVthey have a word called "zielschmerz"
p24
aVwhich is the dread of getting what you want.
p25
aa(lp26
V(Laughter)
p27
aa(lp28
VFinally fulfilling a lifelong dream.
p29
aVI'm German myself, so I know exactly what that feels like.
p30
aa(lp31
VNow, I'm not sure if I would use any of these words
p32
aVas I go about my day,
p33
aVbut I'm really glad they exist.
p34
aVBut the only reason they exist is because I made them up.
p35
aa(lp36
VI am the author of "The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows,"
p37
aVwhich I've been writing for the last seven years.
p38
aVAnd the whole mission of the project
p39
aVis to find holes in the language of emotion
p40
aVand try to fill them
p41
aVso that we have a way of talking about all those human peccadilloes
p42
aVand quirks of the human condition
p43
aVthat we all feel but may not think to talk about
p44
aVbecause we don't have the words to do it.
p45
aa(lp46
VAnd about halfway through this project,
p47
aVI defined "sonder,"
p48
aVthe idea that we all think of ourselves as the main character
p49
aVand everyone else is just extras.
p50
aVBut in reality, we're all the main character,
p51
aVand you yourself are an extra in someone else's story.
p52
aVAnd so as soon as I published that,
p53
aVI got a lot of response from people
p54
aVsaying, "Thank you for giving voice to something I had felt all my life
p55
aVbut there was no word for that."
p56
aVSo it made them feel less alone.
p57
aVThat's the power of words,
p58
aVto make us feel less alone.
p59
aa(lp60
VAnd it was not long after that
p61
aVthat I started to notice sonder
p62
aVbeing used earnestly in conversations online,
p63
aVand not long after I actually noticed it,
p64
aVI caught it next to me in an actual conversation in person.
p65
aVThere is no stranger feeling than making up a word
p66
aVand then seeing it take on a mind of its own.
p67
aVI don't have a word for that yet, but I will.
p68
aa(lp69
V(Laughter)
p70
aa(lp71
VI'm working on it.
p72
aa(lp73
VI started to think about what makes words real,
p74
aVbecause a lot of people ask me,
p75
aVthe most common thing I got from people is,
p76
aV"Well, are these words made up? I don't really understand."
p77
aVAnd I didn't really know what to tell them
p78
aVbecause once sonder started to take off,
p79
aVwho am I to say what words are real and what aren't.
p80
aVAnd so I sort of felt like Steve Jobs, who described his epiphany
p81
aVas when he realized that most of us, as we go through the day,
p82
aVwe just try to avoid bouncing against the walls too much
p83
aVand just sort of get on with things.
p84
aVBut once you realize that people \u2014
p85
aVthat this world was built by people no smarter than you,
p86
aVthen you can reach out and touch those walls
p87
aVand even put your hand through them
p88
aVand realize that you have the power to change it.
p89
aa(lp90
VAnd when people ask me, "Are these words real?"
p91
aVI had a variety of answers that I tried out.
p92
aVSome of them made sense. Some of them didn't.
p93
aVBut one of them I tried out was,
p94
aV"Well, a word is real if you want it to be real."
p95
aVThe way that this path is real because people wanted it to be there.
p96
aa(lp97
V(Laughter)
p98
aa(lp99
VIt happens on college campuses all the time.
p100
aVIt's called a "desire path."
p101
aa(lp102
V(Laughter)
p103
aa(lp104
VBut then I decided, what people are really asking
p105
aVwhen they're asking if a word is real, they're really asking,
p106
aV"Well, how many brains will this give me access to?"
p107
aVBecause I think that's a lot of how we look at language.
p108
aVA word is essentially a key
p109
aVthat gets us into certain people's heads.
p110
aVAnd if it gets us into one brain,
p111
aVit's not really worth it,
p112
aVnot really worth knowing.
p113
aVTwo brains, eh, it depends on who it is.
p114
aVA million brains, OK, now we're talking.
p115
aVAnd so a real word is one that gets you access to as many brains as you can.
p116
aVThat's what makes it worth knowing.
p117
aa(lp118
VIncidentally, the realest word of all by this measure is this.
p119
aa(lp120
V[O.K.]
p121
aa(lp122
VThat's it.
p123
aVThe realest word we have.
p124
aVThat is the closest thing we have to a master key.
p125
aVThat's the most commonly understood word in the world,
p126
aVno matter where you are.
p127
aVThe problem with that is,
p128
aVno one seems to know what those two letters stand for.
p129
aa(lp130
V(Laughter)
p131
aa(lp132
VWhich is kind of weird, right?
p133
aVI mean, it could be a misspelling of "all correct," I guess,
p134
aVor "old kinderhook."
p135
aVNo one really seems to know, but the fact that it doesn't matter
p136
aVsays something about how we add meaning to words.
p137
aVThe meaning is not in the words themselves.
p138
aVWe're the ones that pour ourselves into it.
p139
aa(lp140
VAnd I think, when we're all searching for meaning in our lives,
p141
aVand searching for the meaning of life,
p142
aVI think words have something to do with that.
p143
aVAnd I think if you're looking for the meaning of something,
p144
aVthe dictionary is a decent place to start.
p145
aVIt brings a sense of order
p146
aVto a very chaotic universe.
p147
aVOur view of things is so limited
p148
aVthat we have to come up with patterns and shorthands
p149
aVand try to figure out a way to interpret it
p150
aVand be able to get on with our day.
p151
aVWe need words to contain us, to define ourselves.
p152
aa(lp153
VI think a lot of us feel boxed in
p154
aVby how we use these words.
p155
aVWe forget that words are made up.
p156
aVIt's not just my words. All words are made up,
p157
aVbut not all of them mean something.
p158
aVWe're all just sort of trapped in our own lexicons
p159
aVthat don't necessarily correlate with people who aren't already like us,
p160
aVand so I think I feel us drifting apart a little more every year,
p161
aVthe more seriously we take words.
p162
aa(lp163
VBecause remember, words are not real.
p164
aVThey don't have meaning. We do.
p165
aa(lp166
VAnd I'd like to leave you with a reading
p167
aVfrom one of my favorite philosophers,
p168
aVBill Watterson, who created "Calvin and Hobbes."
p169
aVHe said,
p170
aV"Creating a life that reflects your values and satisfies your soul
p171
aVis a rare achievement.
p172
aVTo invent your own life's meaning
p173
aVis not easy,
p174
aVbut it is still allowed,
p175
aVand I think you'll be happier for the trouble."
p176
aa(lp177
VThank you.
