VI am sorry I cannot show you my face,
p4
aVbecause if I do, the bad guys will come for me.
p5
aa(lp6
VMy journey started 14 years ago.
p7
aVI was a young reporter. I had just come out of college.
p8
aa(lp9
VThen I got a scoop.
p10
aVThe scoop was quite a very simple story.
p11
aVPolice officers were taking bribes
p12
aVfrom hawkers who were hawking on the streets.
p13
aVAs a young reporter, I thought that I should do it
p14
aVin a different way, so that it has a maximum impact,
p15
aVsince everybody knew that it was happening,
p16
aVand yet there was nothing that was keeping it out of the system.
p17
aa(lp18
VSo I decided to go there
p19
aVand act as a seller.
p20
aVAs part of selling, I was able to document
p21
aVthe hard core evidence.
p22
aVThe impact was great.
p23
aVIt was fantastic.
p24
aa(lp25
VThis was what many call immersion journalism,
p26
aVor undercover journalism.
p27
aVI am an undercover journalist.
p28
aVMy journalism is hinged on three basic principles:
p29
aVnaming, shaming and jailing.
p30
aVJournalism is about results.
p31
aVIt's about affecting your community or your society
p32
aVin the most progressive way.
p33
aVI have worked on this for over 14 years,
p34
aVand I can tell you, the results are very good.
p35
aa(lp36
VOne story that comes to mind
p37
aVin my undercover pieces
p38
aVis "Spirit Child."
p39
aVIt was about children who were born with deformities,
p40
aVand their parents felt that once they were born
p41
aVwith those deformities,
p42
aVthey were not good enough to live in the society,
p43
aVso they were given some concoction to take
p44
aVand as a result they died.
p45
aVSo I built a prosthetic baby,
p46
aVand I went into the village,
p47
aVpretended as though this baby had been born
p48
aVwith a deformity, and here was the guys who do the killing.
p49
aVThey got themselves ready.
p50
aVIn their bids to kill, I got the police on standby,
p51
aVand they came that fateful morning
p52
aVto come and kill the child.
p53
aVI recall how they were seriously boiling the concoction.
p54
aVThey put it on fire. It was boiling hot,
p55
aVgetting ready to give to the kids.
p56
aVWhilst this was going on, the police I had alerted,
p57
aVthey were on standby,
p58
aVand just as the concoction was ready,
p59
aVand they were about to give it to the kids,
p60
aVI phoned the police,
p61
aVand fortunately they came and busted them.
p62
aVAs I speak now, they are before the courts.
p63
aVDon't forget the key principles:
p64
aVnaming, shaming and jailing.
p65
aVThe court process is taking place,
p66
aVand I'm very sure at the end of the day
p67
aVwe will find them, and we will put them
p68
aVwhere they belong too.
p69
aa(lp70
VAnother key story that comes to mind,
p71
aVwhich relates to this spirit child phenomenon,
p72
aVis "The Spell of the Albinos."
p73
aVI'm sure most of you may have heard, in Tanzania,
p74
aVchildren who are born with albinism
p75
aVare sometimes considered as being unfit
p76
aVto live in society.
p77
aVTheir bodies are chopped up with machetes
p78
aVand are supposed to be used for some concoctions
p79
aVor some potions for people to get money \u2014
p80
aVor so many, many stories people would tell about it.
p81
aVIt was time to go undercover again.
p82
aVSo I went undercover as a man who was interested
p83
aVin this particular business, of course.
p84
aVAgain, a prosthetic arm was built.
p85
aVFor the first time, I filmed on hidden camera
p86
aVthe guys who do this, and they were ready to buy the arm
p87
aVand they were ready to use it to prepare
p88
aVthose potions for people.
p89
aa(lp90
VI am glad today the Tanzanian government has taken action,
p91
aVbut the key issue is that the Tanzanian government
p92
aVcould only take action because the evidence was available.
p93
aVMy journalism is about hard core evidence.
p94
aVIf I say you have stolen, I show you the evidence
p95
aVthat you have stolen.
p96
aVI show you how you stole it
p97
aVand when, or what you used
p98
aVwhat you had stolen to do.
p99
aVWhat is the essence of journalism if it doesn't benefit society?
p100
aa(lp101
VMy kind of journalism is a product
p102
aVof my society.
p103
aVI know that sometimes
p104
aVpeople have their own criticisms
p105
aVabout undercover journalism.
p106
aa(lp107
V(Video) Official: He brought out some money from his pockets
p108
aVand put it on the table,
p109
aVso that we should not be afraid.
p110
aVHe wants to bring the cocoa and send it to Cote d'Ivoire.
p111
aVSo with my hidden intention, I kept quiet.
p112
aVI didn't utter a word.
p113
aVBut my colleagues didn't know.
p114
aVSo after collecting the money,
p115
aVwhen he left, we were waiting for him to bring the goods.
p116
aVImmediately after he left, I told my colleagues that
p117
aVsince I was the leader of the group,
p118
aVI told my colleagues that if they come,
p119
aVwe will arrest them.
p120
aa(lp121
VSecond official: I don't even know the place called [unclear].
p122
aVI've never stepped there before.
p123
aVSo I'm surprised.
p124
aVYou see a hand counting money just in front of me.
p125
aVThe next moment, you see the money in my hands,
p126
aVcounting, whereas I have not come into contact with anybody.
p127
aVI have not done any business with anybody.
p128
aVReporter: When Metro News contacted investigative reporter
p129
aa(lp130
VAnas Aremeyaw Anas for his reaction,
p131
aVhe just smiled and gave this video extract
p132
aVhe did not use in the documentary recently shown onscreen.
p133
aVThe officer who earlier denied involvement
p134
aVpecks a calculator to compute the amount of money
p135
aVthey will charge on the cocoa to be smuggled.
p136
aa(lp137
VAnas Aremeyaw Anas: This was another story on anticorruption.
p138
aVAnd here was him, denying.
p139
aVBut you see, when you have the hard core evidence,
p140
aVyou are able to affect society.
p141
aVSometimes these are some of the headlines that come. (Music)

aa(lp170
VJohn Evans Atta Mills: What Anas says
p171
aVis not something which is unknown to many of us,
p172
aVbut please, those of you who are agents,
p173
aVand who are leading the customs officers into temptation,
p174
aVI'm telling you, Ghana is not going to say
p175
aVany good things to you about this.
p176
aa(lp177
VAAA: That was my president.
p178
aa(lp179
VI thought that I couldn't come here
p180
aVwithout giving you something special.
p181
aVI have a piece, and I'm excited that
p182
aVI'm sharing it for the first time with you here.
p183
aVI have been undercover in the prisons.
p184
aVI have been there for a long time.
p185
aVAnd I can tell you, what I saw is not nice.
p186
aVBut again, I can only affect society
p187
aVand affect government if I bring out the hard core evidence.
p188
aVMany times, the prison authorities have denied
p189
aVever having issues of drug abuse,
p190
aVissues of sodomy, so many issues they would deny
p191
aVthat it ever happens.
p192
aVHow can you obtain the hard core evidence?
p193
aa(lp194
VSo I was in the prison. ["Nsawan Prison"]
p195
aVNow, what you are seeing is a pile of dead bodies.
p196
aVNow, I happen to have followed one of my inmates,
p197
aVone of my friends, from his sick bed till death,
p198
aVand I can tell you it was not a nice thing at all.
p199
aVThere were issues of bad food being served
p200
aVas I recall that some of the food I ate
p201
aVis just not good for a human being.
p202
aVToilet facilities: very bad.
p203
aVI mean, you had to queue to get proper toilets to attend \u2014
p204
aVand that's what I call proper,
p205
aVwhen four of us are on a manhole.
p206
aVIt is something that if you narrate it to somebody,
p207
aVthe person wouldn't believe it.
p208
aVThe only way that you can let the person believe
p209
aVis when you show hard core evidence.
p210
aVOf course, drugs were abundant.
p211
aVIt was easier to get cannabis, heroin and cocaine,
p212
aVfaster even, in the prison than outside the prison.
p213
aa(lp214
VEvil in the society is an extreme disease.
p215
aVIf you have extreme diseases,
p216
aVyou need to get extreme remedies.
p217
aVMy kind of journalism might not fit in other continents
p218
aVor other countries,
p219
aVbut I can tell you, it works in my part of the continent
p220
aVof Africa, because usually, when people talk
p221
aVabout corruption, they ask, "Where is the evidence?
p222
aVShow me the evidence."
p223
aVI say, "This is the evidence."
p224
aVAnd that has aided in me putting a lot of people behind bars.
p225
aa(lp226
VYou see, we on the continent are able
p227
aVto tell the story better because we face the conditions
p228
aVand we see the conditions.
p229
aVThat is why I was particularly excited
p230
aVwhen we launched our "Africa Investigates" series
p231
aVwhere we investigated a lot of African countries.
p232
aVAs a result of the success of the "Africa Investigates" series,
p233
aVwe are moving on to World Investigates.
p234
aVBy the end of it, a lot more bad guys
p235
aVon our continent will be put behind bars.
p236
aa(lp237
VThis will not stop.
p238
aVI'm going to carry on with this kind of journalism,
p239
aVbecause I know that when evil men destroy,
p240
aVgood men must build and bind.
p241
aa(lp242
VThank you very much.
p243
aa(lp244
V(Applause)
p245
aa(lp246
VChris Anderson: Thank you. Thank you.
p247
aVI have some questions for you.
p248
aVHow did you end up in jail? This was just a few weeks ago, I believe, yeah?
p249
aa(lp250
VAAA: Sure. You know, undercover is all about
p251
aVsetting the priorities right, so we got people
p252
aVto take me to court.
p253
aVSo I went through the very legal process,
p254
aVbecause at the end of the day, the prison authorities
p255
aVwant to check whether indeed you have been there or not,
p256
aVand that's how I got in there.
p257
aa(lp258
VCA: So someone sued you in court,
p259
aVand they took you there, and you were in remand custody
p260
aVfor part of it, and you did that deliberately.
p261
aa(lp262
VAAA: Yes, yes.
p263
aa(lp264
VCA: Talk to me just about fear
p265
aVand how you manage that,
p266
aVbecause you're regularly putting your life at risk.
p267
aVHow do you do that?
p268
aa(lp269
VAAA: You see, undercover is always a last resort.
p270
aVBefore we go undercover, we follow the rules.
p271
aVAnd I'm only comfortable and I'm purged of fear
p272
aVwhenever I am sure that all the steps
p273
aVhave been taken. I don't do it alone. I have a backup team
p274
aVwho help ensure that the safety and all the systems
p275
aVare put in place, but you've got to take
p276
aVvery intelligent decisions whenever they are happening.
p277
aVIf you don't, you will end up losing your life.
p278
aVSo yes, when the backup systems are put in place,
p279
aVI'm okay, I go in. Risky, yes,
p280
aVbut it's a hazard of a profession.
p281
aVI mean, everybody has their hazard.
p282
aVAnd once you say that is yours,
p283
aVyou've got to take it, as and when it comes.
p284
aa(lp285
VCA: Well, you're an amazing human and you've done amazing work
p286
aVand you've taught us a story
p287
aVlike no story I think any of us have heard before.
p288
aVAnd we're appreciative. We salute you. Thank you so much, Anas.
p289
aa(lp290
VAAA: Thank you.
p291
aa(lp292
VCA: Thank you. Stay safe. (Applause)
