VWe are going to take a quick voyage
p4
aVover the cognitive history of the 20th century,
p5
aVbecause during that century,
p6
aVour minds have altered dramatically.
p7
aVAs you all know, the cars that people drove in 1900
p8
aVhave altered because the roads are better
p9
aVand because of technology.
p10
aVAnd our minds have altered, too.
p11
aVWe've gone from people who confronted a concrete world
p12
aVand analyzed that world primarily in terms
p13
aVof how much it would benefit them
p14
aVto people who confront a very complex world,
p15
aVand it's a world where we've had to develop
p16
aVnew mental habits, new habits of mind.
p17
aVAnd these include things like
p18
aVclothing that concrete world with classification,
p19
aVintroducing abstractions that we try to make
p20
aVlogically consistent,
p21
aVand also taking the hypothetical seriously,
p22
aVthat is, wondering about what might have been
p23
aVrather than what is.
p24
aa(lp25
VNow, this dramatic change was drawn to my attention
p26
aVthrough massive I.Q. gains over time,
p27
aVand these have been truly massive.
p28
aVThat is, we don't just get a few more questions right
p29
aVon I.Q. tests.
p30
aVWe get far more questions right on I.Q. tests
p31
aVthan each succeeding generation
p32
aVback to the time that they were invented.
p33
aVIndeed, if you score the people a century ago
p34
aVagainst modern norms,
p35
aVthey would have an average I.Q. of 70.
p36
aVIf you score us against their norms,
p37
aVwe would have an average I.Q. of 130.
p38
aVNow this has raised all sorts of questions.
p39
aVWere our immediate ancestors
p40
aVon the verge of mental retardation?
p41
aVBecause 70 is normally the score for mental retardation.
p42
aVOr are we on the verge of all being gifted?
p43
aVBecause 130 is the cutting line for giftedness.
p44
aa(lp45
VNow I'm going to try and argue for a third alternative
p46
aVthat's much more illuminating than either of those,
p47
aVand to put this into perspective,
p48
aVlet's imagine that a Martian came down to Earth
p49
aVand found a ruined civilization.
p50
aVAnd this Martian was an archaeologist,
p51
aVand they found scores, target scores,
p52
aVthat people had used for shooting.
p53
aVAnd first they looked at 1865,
p54
aVand they found that in a minute,
p55
aVpeople had only put one bullet in the bullseye.
p56
aVAnd then they found, in 1898,
p57
aVthat they'd put about five bullets in the bullseye in a minute.
p58
aVAnd then about 1918 they put a hundred bullets in the bullseye.
p59
aVAnd initially, that archaeologist would be baffled.
p60
aVThey would say, look, these tests were designed
p61
aVto find out how much people were steady of hand,
p62
aVhow keen their eyesight was,
p63
aVwhether they had control of their weapon.
p64
aVHow could these performances have escalated
p65
aVto this enormous degree?
p66
aVWell we now know, of course, the answer.
p67
aVIf that Martian looked at battlefields,
p68
aVthey would find that people had only muskets
p69
aVat the time of the Civil War
p70
aVand that they had repeating rifles
p71
aVat the time of the Spanish-American War,
p72
aVand then they had machine guns
p73
aVby the time of World War I.
p74
aVAnd, in other words, it was the equipment
p75
aVthat was in the hands of the average soldier
p76
aVthat was responsible, not greater keenness of eye
p77
aVor steadiness of hand.
p78
aa(lp79
VNow what we have to imagine is the mental artillery
p80
aVthat we have picked up over those hundred years,
p81
aVand I think again that another thinker will help us here,
p82
aVand that's Luria.
p83
aVLuria looked at people
p84
aVjust before they entered the scientific age,
p85
aVand he found that these people
p86
aVwere resistant to classifying the concrete world.
p87
aVThey wanted to break it up
p88
aVinto little bits that they could use.
p89
aVHe found that they were resistant
p90
aVto deducing the hypothetical,
p91
aVto speculating about what might be,
p92
aVand he found finally that they didn't deal well
p93
aVwith abstractions or using logic on those abstractions.
p94
aa(lp95
VNow let me give you a sample of some of his interviews.
p96
aVHe talked to the head man of a person
p97
aVin rural Russia.
p98
aVThey'd only had, as people had in 1900,
p99
aVabout four years of schooling.
p100
aVAnd he asked that particular person,
p101
aVwhat do crows and fish have in common?
p102
aVAnd the fellow said, "Absolutely nothing.
p103
aVYou know, I can eat a fish. I can't eat a crow.
p104
aVA crow can peck at a fish.
p105
aVA fish can't do anything to a crow."
p106
aVAnd Luria said, "But aren't they both animals?"
p107
aVAnd he said, "Of course not.
p108
aVOne's a fish.
p109
aVThe other is a bird."
p110
aVAnd he was interested, effectively,
p111
aVin what he could do with those concrete objects.
p112
aa(lp113
VAnd then Luria went to another person,
p114
aVand he said to them,
p115
aV"There are no camels in Germany.
p116
aVHamburg is a city in Germany.
p117
aVAre there camels in Hamburg?"
p118
aVAnd the fellow said,
p119
aV"Well, if it's large enough, there ought to be camels there."
p120
aVAnd Luria said, "But what do my words imply?"
p121
aVAnd he said, "Well, maybe it's a small village,
p122
aVand there's no room for camels."
p123
aVIn other words, he was unwilling to treat this
p124
aVas anything but a concrete problem,
p125
aVand he was used to camels being in villages,
p126
aVand he was quite unable to use the hypothetical,
p127
aVto ask himself what if there were no camels in Germany.
p128
aa(lp129
VA third interview was conducted
p130
aVwith someone about the North Pole.
p131
aVAnd Luria said, "At the North Pole, there is always snow.
p132
aVWherever there is always snow, the bears are white.
p133
aVWhat color are the bears at the North Pole?"
p134
aVAnd the response was, "Such a thing
p135
aVis to be settled by testimony.
p136
aVIf a wise person came from the North Pole
p137
aVand told me the bears were white,
p138
aVI might believe him,
p139
aVbut every bear that I have seen is a brown bear."
p140
aVNow you see again, this person has rejected
p141
aVgoing beyond the concrete world
p142
aVand analyzing it through everyday experience,
p143
aVand it was important to that person
p144
aVwhat color bears were \u2014
p145
aVthat is, they had to hunt bears.
p146
aVThey weren't willing to engage in this.
p147
aVOne of them said to Luria,
p148
aV"How can we solve things that aren't real problems?
p149
aVNone of these problems are real.
p150
aVHow can we address them?"
p151
aa(lp152
VNow, these three categories \u2014
p153
aVclassification,
p154
aVusing logic on abstractions,
p155
aVtaking the hypothetical seriously \u2014
p156
aVhow much difference do they make in the real world
p157
aVbeyond the testing room?
p158
aVAnd let me give you a few illustrations.
p159
aa(lp160
VFirst, almost all of us today get a high school diploma.
p161
aVThat is, we've gone from four to eight years of education
p162
aVto 12 years of formal education,
p163
aVand 52 percent of Americans
p164
aVhave actually experienced some type of tertiary education.
p165
aVNow, not only do we have much more education,
p166
aVand much of that education is scientific,
p167
aVand you can't do science without classifying the world.
p168
aVYou can't do science without proposing hypotheses.
p169
aVYou can't do science without making it logically consistent.
p170
aVAnd even down in grade school, things have changed.
p171
aVIn 1910, they looked at the examinations
p172
aVthat the state of Ohio gave to 14-year-olds,
p173
aVand they found that they were all
p174
aVfor socially valued concrete information.
p175
aVThey were things like,
p176
aVwhat are the capitals of the 44 or 45 states
p177
aVthat existed at that time?
p178
aVWhen they looked at the exams
p179
aVthat the state of Ohio gave in 1990,
p180
aVthey were all about abstractions.
p181
aVThey were things like,
p182
aVwhy is the largest city of a state rarely the capital?
p183
aVAnd you were supposed to think, well,
p184
aVthe state legislature was rural-controlled,
p185
aVand they hated the big city,
p186
aVso rather than putting the capital in a big city,
p187
aVthey put it in a county seat.
p188
aVThey put it in Albany rather than New York.
p189
aVThey put it in Harrisburg rather than Philadelphia.
p190
aVAnd so forth.
p191
aVSo the tenor of education has changed.
p192
aVWe are educating people to take the hypothetical seriously,
p193
aVto use abstractions, and to link them logically.
p194
aa(lp195
VWhat about employment?
p196
aVWell, in 1900, three percent of Americans
p197
aVpracticed professions that were cognitively demanding.
p198
aVOnly three percent were lawyers or doctors or teachers.
p199
aVToday, 35 percent of Americans
p200
aVpractice cognitively demanding professions,
p201
aVnot only to the professions proper like lawyer
p202
aVor doctor or scientist or lecturer,
p203
aVbut many, many sub-professions
p204
aVhaving to do with being a technician,
p205
aVa computer programmer.
p206
aVA whole range of professions now make cognitive demands.
p207
aVAnd we can only meet the terms of employment
p208
aVin the modern world by being cognitively
p209
aVfar more flexible.
p210
aVAnd it's not just that we have many more people
p211
aVin cognitively demanding professions.
p212
aVThe professions have been upgraded.
p213
aVCompare the doctor in 1900,
p214
aVwho really had only a few tricks up his sleeve,
p215
aVwith the modern general practitioner or specialist,
p216
aVwith years of scientific training.
p217
aVCompare the banker in 1900,
p218
aVwho really just needed a good accountant
p219
aVand to know who was trustworthy in the local community
p220
aVfor paying back their mortgage.
p221
aVWell, the merchant bankers who brought the world to their knees
p222
aVmay have been morally remiss,
p223
aVbut they were cognitively very agile.
p224
aVThey went far beyond that 1900 banker.
p225
aVThey had to look at computer projections
p226
aVfor the housing market.
p227
aVThey had to get complicated CDO-squared
p228
aVin order to bundle debt together
p229
aVand make debt look as if it were actually a profitable asset.
p230
aVThey had to prepare a case to get rating agencies
p231
aVto give it a AAA,
p232
aVthough in many cases, they had virtually bribed the rating agencies.
p233
aVAnd they also, of course, had to get people
p234
aVto accept these so-called assets
p235
aVand pay money for them
p236
aVeven though they were highly vulnerable.
p237
aVOr take a farmer today.
p238
aVI take the farm manager of today as very different
p239
aVfrom the farmer of 1900.
p240
aVSo it hasn't just been the spread
p241
aVof cognitively demanding professions.
p242
aVIt's also been the upgrading of tasks
p243
aVlike lawyer and doctor and what have you
p244
aVthat have made demands on our cognitive faculties.
p245
aa(lp246
VBut I've talked about education and employment.
p247
aVSome of the habits of mind that we have developed
p248
aVover the 20th century
p249
aVhave paid off in unexpected areas.
p250
aVI'm primarily a moral philosopher.
p251
aVI merely have a holiday in psychology,
p252
aVand what interests me in general is moral debate.
p253
aVNow over the last century,
p254
aVin developed nations like America,
p255
aVmoral debate has escalated
p256
aVbecause we take the hypothetical seriously,
p257
aVand we also take universals seriously
p258
aVand look for logical connections.
p259
aVWhen I came home in 1955 from university
p260
aVat the time of Martin Luther King,
p261
aVa lot of people came home at that time
p262
aVand started having arguments with their parents and grandparents.
p263
aVMy father was born in 1885,
p264
aVand he was mildly racially biased.
p265
aVAs an Irishman, he hated the English so much
p266
aVhe didn't have much emotion for anyone else.
p267
aV(Laughter)
p268
aVBut he did have a sense that black people were inferior.
p269
aVAnd when we said to our parents and grandparents,
p270
aV"How would you feel if tomorrow morning you woke up black?"
p271
aVthey said that is the dumbest thing you've ever said.
p272
aVWho have you ever known who woke up in the morning \u2014
p273
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p274
aVthat turned black?
p275
aa(lp276
VIn other words, they were fixed in the concrete
p277
aVmores and attitudes they had inherited.
p278
aVThey would not take the hypothetical seriously,
p279
aVand without the hypothetical,
p280
aVit's very difficult to get moral argument off the ground.
p281
aVYou have to say, imagine you were
p282
aVin Iran, and imagine that your relatives
p283
aVall suffered from collateral damage
p284
aVeven though they had done no wrong.
p285
aVHow would you feel about that?
p286
aVAnd if someone of the older generation says,
p287
aVwell, our government takes care of us,
p288
aVand it's up to their government to take care of them,
p289
aVthey're just not willing to take the hypothetical seriously.
p290
aVOr take an Islamic father whose daughter has been raped,
p291
aVand he feels he's honor-bound to kill her.
p292
aVWell, he's treating his mores
p293
aVas if they were sticks and stones and rocks that he had inherited,
p294
aVand they're unmovable in any way by logic.
p295
aVThey're just inherited mores.
p296
aVToday we would say something like,
p297
aVwell, imagine you were knocked unconscious and sodomized.
p298
aVWould you deserve to be killed?
p299
aVAnd he would say, well that's not in the Koran.
p300
aVThat's not one of the principles I've got.
p301
aVWell you, today, universalize your principles.
p302
aVYou state them as abstractions and you use logic on them.
p303
aVIf you have a principle such as,
p304
aVpeople shouldn't suffer unless they're guilty of something,
p305
aVthen to exclude black people
p306
aVyou've got to make exceptions, don't you?
p307
aVYou have to say, well, blackness of skin,
p308
aVyou couldn't suffer just for that.
p309
aVIt must be that blacks are somehow tainted.
p310
aVAnd then we can bring empirical evidence to bear, can't we,
p311
aVand say, well how can you consider all blacks tainted
p312
aVwhen St. Augustine was black and Thomas Sowell is black.
p313
aVAnd you can get moral argument off the ground, then,
p314
aVbecause you're not treating moral principles as concrete entities.
p315
aVYou're treating them as universals,
p316
aVto be rendered consistent by logic.
p317
aa(lp318
VNow how did all of this arise out of I.Q. tests?
p319
aVThat's what initially got me going on cognitive history.
p320
aVIf you look at the I.Q. test,
p321
aVyou find the gains have been greatest in certain areas.
p322
aVThe similarities subtest of the Wechsler
p323
aVis about classification,
p324
aVand we have made enormous gains
p325
aVon that classification subtest.
p326
aVThere are other parts of the I.Q. test battery
p327
aVthat are about using logic on abstractions.
p328
aVSome of you may have taken Raven's Progressive Matrices,
p329
aVand it's all about analogies.
p330
aVAnd in 1900, people could do simple analogies.
p331
aVThat is, if you said to them, cats are like wildcats.
p332
aVWhat are dogs like?
p333
aVThey would say wolves.
p334
aVBut by 1960, people could attack Raven's
p335
aVon a much more sophisticated level.
p336
aVIf you said, we've got two squares followed by a triangle,
p337
aVwhat follows two circles?
p338
aVThey could say a semicircle.
p339
aVJust as a triangle is half of a square,
p340
aVa semicircle is half of a circle.
p341
aVBy 2010, college graduates, if you said
p342
aVtwo circles followed by a semicircle,
p343
aVtwo sixteens followed by what,
p344
aVthey would say eight, because eight is half of 16.
p345
aVThat is, they had moved so far from the concrete world
p346
aVthat they could even ignore
p347
aVthe appearance of the symbols that were involved in the question.
p348
aa(lp349
VNow, I should say one thing that's very disheartening.
p350
aVWe haven't made progress on all fronts.
p351
aVOne of the ways in which we would like to deal
p352
aVwith the sophistication of the modern world
p353
aVis through politics,
p354
aVand sadly you can have humane moral principles,
p355
aVyou can classify, you can use logic on abstractions,
p356
aVand if you're ignorant of history and of other countries,
p357
aVyou can't do politics.
p358
aVWe've noticed, in a trend among young Americans,
p359
aVthat they read less history and less literature
p360
aVand less material about foreign lands,
p361
aVand they're essentially ahistorical.
p362
aVThey live in the bubble of the present.
p363
aVThey don't know the Korean War from the war in Vietnam.
p364
aVThey don't know who was an ally of America in World War II.
p365
aVThink how different America would be
p366
aVif every American knew that this is the fifth time
p367
aVWestern armies have gone to Afghanistan to put its house in order,
p368
aVand if they had some idea of exactly what had happened
p369
aVon those four previous occasions.
p370
aV(Laughter)
p371
aVAnd that is, they had barely left,
p372
aVand there wasn't a trace in the sand.
p373
aVOr imagine how different things would be
p374
aVif most Americans knew that we had been lied
p375
aVinto four of our last six wars.
p376
aVYou know, the Spanish didn't sink the battleship Maine,
p377
aVthe Lusitania was not an innocent vessel
p378
aVbut was loaded with munitions,
p379
aVthe North Vietnamese did not attack the Seventh Fleet,
p380
aVand, of course, Saddam Hussein hated al Qaeda
p381
aVand had nothing to do with it,
p382
aVand yet the administration convinced 45 percent of the people
p383
aVthat they were brothers in arms,
p384
aVwhen he would hang one from the nearest lamppost.
p385
aa(lp386
VBut I don't want to end on a pessimistic note.
p387
aVThe 20th century has shown enormous cognitive reserves
p388
aVin ordinary people that we have now realized,
p389
aVand the aristocracy was convinced
p390
aVthat the average person couldn't make it,
p391
aVthat they could never share their mindset
p392
aVor their cognitive abilities.
p393
aVLord Curzon once said
p394
aVhe saw people bathing in the North Sea,
p395
aVand he said, "Why did no one tell me
p396
aVwhat white bodies the lower orders have?"
p397
aVAs if they were a reptile.
p398
aVWell, Dickens was right and he was wrong. [Correction: Rudyard Kipling]
p399
aV[Kipling] said, "The colonel's lady and Judy O'Grady
p400
aVare sisters underneath the skin."
