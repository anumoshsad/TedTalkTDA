VSome of you have heard the story before,
p4
aVbut, in fact, there's somebody in the audience
p5
aVwho's never heard this story in front of an audience before,
p6
aVso I'm a little more nervous than I normally am telling this story.
p7
aVI used to be a photographer for many years.
p8
aVIn 1978, I was working for "TIME Magazine"
p9
aVand I was given a three-day assignment to photograph Amerasian children,
p10
aVchildren who had been fathered by American GIs all over Southeast Asia,
p11
aVand then abandoned \u2014 40,000 children all over Asia.
p12
aVI had never heard the word Amerasian before.
p13
aVI spent a few days photographing children in different countries,
p14
aVand like a lot of photographers and a lot of journalists,
p15
aVI always hoped that when my pictures are published,
p16
aVthey might actually have an effect on a situation,
p17
aVinstead of just documenting it.
p18
aa(lp19
VSo, I was so disturbed by what I saw
p20
aVand I was so unhappy with the article that ran afterwards,
p21
aVthat I decided I would take six months off.
p22
aVI was 28 years old.
p23
aVI decided I would find six children in different countries,
p24
aVand actually go spend some time with the kids,
p25
aVand try to tell their story a little bit better
p26
aVthan I thought I had done for Time magazine.
p27
aVIn the course of doing the story,
p28
aVI was looking for children who hadn't been photographed before,
p29
aVand the Pearl Buck Foundation told me that they worked with a lot of Americans
p30
aVwho were donating money to help some of these kids.
p31
aVAnd a man told me,
p32
aVwho ran the Pearl Buck Foundation in Korea,
p33
aVthat there was a young girl, who was 11 years old,
p34
aVbeing raised by her grandmother.
p35
aVAnd the grandmother had never let any Westerners see her.
p36
aVEvery time any Westerners came to the village, she hid the girl.
p37
aVOf course, I was immediately intrigued.
p38
aVI saw photographs of her and I thought I wanted to go.
p39
aVAnd the guy just told me,
p40
aV"This grandmother \u2014 there's no way she's ever going to let you
p41
aVmeet this girl that's she's raising."
p42
aa(lp43
VI took a translator with me and went to this village,
p44
aVfound the grandmother, sat down with her.
p45
aVAnd to my astonishment, she agreed to let me photograph her granddaughter.
p46
aVAnd I was paying for this myself, so I asked the translator
p47
aVif it would be OK if I stayed for the week.
p48
aVI had a sleeping bag.
p49
aVThe family had a small shed on the side of the house,
p50
aVso I said, "Could I sleep in my sleeping bag in the evenings?"
p51
aVAnd I just told the little girl, whose name was Eun-Sook Lee,
p52
aVthat if I ever did anything to embarrass her \u2014
p53
aVshe didn't speak a word of English, although she looked very American \u2014
p54
aVshe could put up her hand and say, "Stop," and I would stop taking pictures.
p55
aVThen my translator left. I couldn't speak a word of Korean.
p56
aVThis is the first night I met Eun-Sook.
p57
aVHer mother was still alive.
p58
aVShe was not raising her, her grandmother was raising her.
p59
aVAnd what struck me immediately
p60
aVwas how in love the two of these people were.
p61
aVThe grandmother was incredibly fond, deeply in love with this little girl.
p62
aVThey slept on the floor at night.
p63
aVThe way they heat their homes in Korea is to put bricks under the floors,
p64
aVso the heat radiates from underneath the floor.
p65
aVEun-Sook was 11 years old.
p66
aa(lp67
VI had photographed, as I said, a lot of these kids.
p68
aVEun-Sook was the fifth child that I found to photograph.
p69
aVAnd almost universally, amongst all the kids,
p70
aVthey were really psychologically damaged
p71
aVby having been made fun of, ridiculed, picked on and been rejected.
p72
aVAnd Korea was probably the place I found to be the worst for these kids.
p73
aVAnd what struck me immediately in meeting Eun-Sook
p74
aVwas how confident she appeared to be,
p75
aVhow happy she seemed to be in her own skin.
p76
aVAnd remember this picture,
p77
aVbecause I'm going to show you another picture later.
p78
aVShe looks much like her grandmother, although she looks so Western.
p79
aa(lp80
VI decided to follow her to school.
p81
aVThis is the first morning I stayed with her.
p82
aVThis is on the way to school.
p83
aVThis is the morning assembly outside her school.
p84
aVAnd I noticed that she was clowning around.
p85
aVWhen the teachers would ask questions,
p86
aVshe'd be the first person to raise her hand.
p87
aVAgain, not at all shy or withdrawn,
p88
aVor anything like the other children that I'd photographed.
p89
aVThe first one to go to the blackboard to answer questions.
p90
aVGetting in trouble for whispering into her best friend's ears.
p91
aVAnd one of the other things I said to her through the translator \u2014
p92
aVagain, this thing about saying stop \u2014 was to not pay attention to me.
p93
aVSo she really just completely ignored me most of the time.
p94
aVI noticed that at recess,
p95
aVshe was the girl who picked the other girls to be on her team.
p96
aVIt was very obvious, from the beginning, that she was a leader.
p97
aVThis is on the way home. And that's North Korea up along the hill.
p98
aVThis is up along the DMZ.
p99
aVThey would actually cover the windows every night,
p100
aVso that light couldn't be seen,
p101
aVbecause the South Korean government has said for years
p102
aVthat the North Koreans may invade at any time.
p103
aVSo the closer you were to North Korea, the more terrifying it was.
p104
aa(lp105
VVery often at school, I'd be taking pictures,
p106
aVand she would whisper into her girlfriends' ears,
p107
aVand then look at me and say, "Stop."
p108
aVAnd I would stand at attention, and all the girls would crack up,
p109
aVand it was sort of a little joke.
p110
aa(lp111
V(Laughter)
p112
aa(lp113
VThe end of the week came and my translator came back,
p114
aVbecause I'd asked her to come back,
p115
aVso I could formally thank the grandmother and Eun-Sook.
p116
aVAnd in the course of the grandmother talking to the translator,
p117
aVthe grandmother started crying.
p118
aVAnd I said to my translator, "What's going on, why is she crying?"
p119
aVAnd she spoke to the grandmother for a moment,
p120
aVand then she started getting tears in her eyes.
p121
aVAnd I said, "What did I do? Why is everyone crying?"
p122
aVAnd the translator said,
p123
aV"The grandmother says that she thinks she's dying,
p124
aVand she wants to know if you would take Eun-Sook to America with you."
p125
aVAnd I said, "I'm 28 years old and I live in hotels,
p126
aVand I'm not married."
p127
aVI mean, I had fallen in love with this girl,
p128
aVbut you know, emotionally I was about 12 years old.
p129
aVIf you know of photographers,
p130
aVthe joke is it's the finest form of delayed adolescence ever invented.
p131
aV"Sorry, I have to go on an assignment, I'll be back" \u2014
p132
aVand then you never come back.
p133
aa(lp134
VSo I asked the translator why she thought she was dying.
p135
aVCan I get her to a hospital? Could I pay to get her a doctor?
p136
aVAnd she refused any help at all.
p137
aVSo when I got outside, I gave the translator some money and said,
p138
aV"Go back and see if you can do something."
p139
aVAnd I gave the grandmother my business card.
p140
aVAnd I said, "If you're serious, I will try to find a family for her."
p141
aVAnd I immediately wrote a letter to my best friends in Atlanta, Georgia,
p142
aVwho had an 11-year-old son.
p143
aVAnd my best friend had mistakenly one day said something
p144
aVabout wishing he had another child.
p145
aVSo my friends Gene and Gayle had not heard from me in about a year,
p146
aVand suddenly I was calling,
p147
aVsaying "I'm in Korea and I've met this extraordinary girl."
p148
aVAnd I said, "The grandmother thinks she's sick,
p149
aVbut I think maybe we would have to bring the grandmother over also."
p150
aVAnd I said, "I'll pay for the ... " I mean, I had this whole sort of picture.
p151
aVSo anyway, I left.
p152
aVAnd my friends actually said they were very interested in adopting her.
p153
aVAnd I said, "Look, I think I'll scare the grandmother to death,
p154
aVif I tell her that you're willing to adopt her.
p155
aVI want to go back and talk to her." But I was off on assignment.
p156
aVI figured I'd come back in a couple of weeks
p157
aVand talk to the grandmother.
p158
aa(lp159
VAnd on Christmas Day, I was in Bangkok with a group of photographers
p160
aVand got a telegram \u2014 back in those days, you got telegrams \u2014
p161
aVfrom Time magazine saying someone in Korea had died
p162
aVand left their child in a will to me.
p163
aVDid I know anything about this?
p164
aVBecause I hadn't told them what I was doing,
p165
aVbecause I was so upset with the story they'd run.
p166
aVSo, I went back to Korea, and I went back to Eun-Sook's village,
p167
aVand she was gone.
p168
aVAnd the house that I had spent time in was empty.
p169
aVIt was incredibly cold.
p170
aVNo one in the village would tell me where Eun-Sook was,
p171
aVbecause the grandmother had always hidden her from Westerners.
p172
aVAnd they had no idea about this request that she'd made of me.
p173
aVSo I finally found Myung Sung,
p174
aVher best friend that she used to play with after school every day.
p175
aVAnd Myung Sung, under some pressure from me and the translator,
p176
aVgave us an address on the outside of Seoul.
p177
aVAnd I went to that address and knocked on the door,
p178
aVand a man answered the door.
p179
aVIt was not a very nice area of Seoul, there were mud streets outside of it.
p180
aVAnd I knocked on the door and Eun-Sook answered the door,
p181
aVand her eyes were bloodshot, and she seemed to be in shock.
p182
aVShe didn't recognize me \u2014 there was no recognition whatsoever.
p183
aVAnd this man came to the door and kind of barked something in Korean.
p184
aVAnd I said to the translator, "What did he say?"
p185
aVAnd she said, "He wants to know who you are."
p186
aVAnd I said, "Tell him that I am a photographer."
p187
aVI started explaining who I was, and he interrupted.
p188
aVAnd she said, "He says he knows who you are, what do you want?"
p189
aVI said, "Well, tell him that I was asked by this little girl's grandmother
p190
aVto find a family for her."
p191
aVAnd he said, "I'm her uncle, she's fine, you can leave now."
p192
aa(lp193
VSo I was \u2014
p194
aVThe door was being slammed in my face,
p195
aVit's incredibly cold, and I'm trying to think,
p196
aV"What would the hero do in a movie, if I was writing this as a movie script?"
p197
aVSo I said, "It's really cold, I've come a very long way,
p198
aVdo you mind if I come in for a minute? I'm freezing."
p199
aVSo the guy reluctantly let us in and we sat down on the floor.
p200
aVAnd as we started talking, I saw him yell something,
p201
aVand Eun-Sook came and brought us some food.
p202
aVAnd I had this whole mental picture of \u2014 sort of like Cinderella.
p203
aVI sort of had this picture of this incredibly wonderful,
p204
aVbright, happy little child,
p205
aVwho now appeared to be very withdrawn, being enslaved by this family.
p206
aVAnd I was really appalled, and I couldn't figure out what to do.
p207
aVAnd the more I tried talking to him, the less friendly he was getting.
p208
aVSo finally I said "Look," \u2014 this is all through the translator,
p209
aVbecause, you know, I don't speak a word of Korean \u2014
p210
aVand I said, "Look, I'm really glad that Eun-Sook has a family to live with.
p211
aVI was very worried about her.
p212
aVI made a promise to her grandmother, your mother, that I would find a family,
p213
aVand I'm so happy that you're going to take care of her.
p214
aVBut I bought an airline ticket and I'm stuck here for a week.
p215
aVI'm staying in a hotel downtown.
p216
aVWould you like to come and have lunch tomorrow?
p217
aVAnd you can practice your English."
p218
aVBecause he told me \u2014 I was trying to ask him questions about himself.
p219
aa(lp220
VAnd so I went to the hotel, and I found two older Amerasians.
p221
aVA girl whose mother had been a prostitute,
p222
aVand she was a prostitute,
p223
aVand a boy who'd been in and out of jail.
p224
aVAnd I said to them, "Look, there's a little girl
p225
aVwho has a tiny chance of getting out of here
p226
aVand going to America.
p227
aVI don't know if it's the right decision or not,
p228
aVbut I would like you to come to lunch tomorrow
p229
aVand tell the uncle what it's like to walk down the street,
p230
aVwhat people say to you, what you do for a living.
p231
aVI want him to understand what happens if she stays here.
p232
aVAnd I could be wrong, I don't know, but I wish you would come tomorrow."
p233
aa(lp234
VSo, these two came to lunch and we got thrown out of the restaurant.
p235
aVThey were yelling at him, it got to be really ugly.
p236
aVWe went outside, and he was just furious.
p237
aVAnd I knew I had totally blown this thing.
p238
aVHere I was again, trying to figure out what to do.
p239
aVAnd he started yelling at me, and I said to the translator,
p240
aV"Tell him to calm down, what is he saying?"
p241
aVAnd she said, "He's saying, 'Who the hell are you to walk into my house,
p242
aVsome rich American with your cameras around your neck,
p243
aVaccusing me of enslaving my niece?
p244
aVThis is my niece, I love her, she's my sister's daughter.
p245
aVWho the hell are you to accuse me of something like this?'"
p246
aVAnd I said, you know, "Look, you're absolutely right.
p247
aVI don't pretend to understand what's going on here.
p248
aVAll I know is, I've been photographing a lot of these children.
p249
aVI'm in love with your niece,
p250
aVI think she's an incredibly special child."
p251
aVAnd I said, "Look, I will fly my friends over here from the United States
p252
aVif you want to meet them, to see if you approve of them.
p253
aVI just think that \u2014 what little I know about the situation,
p254
aVshe has very little chance here of having the kind of life
p255
aVthat you probably would like her to have."
p256
aa(lp257
VSo, everyone told me afterwards that inviting the prospective parents over
p258
aVwas, again, the stupidest thing I could have possibly done,
p259
aVbecause who's ever good enough for your relative?
p260
aVBut he invited me to come to a ceremony they were having that day
p261
aVfor her grandmother.
p262
aVAnd they actually take items of clothing and photographs,
p263
aVand they burn them as part of the ritual.
p264
aVAnd you can see how different she looks just in three months.
p265
aVThis was now, I think, early February.
p266
aVAnd the pictures before were taken in September.
p267
aVWell, there was an American Maryknoll priest
p268
aVthat I had met in the course of doing the story,
p269
aVwho had 75 children living in his house.
p270
aVHe had three women helping him take care of these kids.
p271
aVAnd so I suggested to the uncle that we go down and meet Father Keane
p272
aVto find out how the adoption process worked.
p273
aVBecause I wanted him to feel
p274
aVlike this was all being done very much above board.
p275
aa(lp276
VSo, this is on the way down to the orphanage.
p277
aVThis is Father Keane. He's just a wonderful guy.
p278
aVHe had kids from all over Korea living there,
p279
aVand he would find families for these kids.
p280
aVThis is a social worker interviewing Eun-Sook.
p281
aVNow, I had always thought she was completely untouched by all of this,
p282
aVbecause the grandmother, to me,
p283
aVappeared to be sort of the village wise woman \u2014
p284
aVthroughout the day, I noticed people kept coming to visit her grandmother.
p285
aVAnd I always had this mental picture
p286
aVthat even though they may have been one of the poorer families in the village,
p287
aVthey were one of the most respected.
p288
aVAnd I always felt that the grandmother had kind of demanded, and insisted,
p289
aVthat the villagers treat Eun-Sook with the same respect they treated her.
p290
aVEun-Sook stayed at Father Keane's,
p291
aVand her uncle agreed to let her stay there until the adoption went through.
p292
aVHe actually agreed to the adoption.
p293
aa(lp294
VAnd I went off on assignment and came back a week later,
p295
aVand Father Keane said, "I've got to talk to you about Eun-Sook."
p296
aVI said, "Oh God, now what?"
p297
aVAnd he takes me into this room, closes the door and says,
p298
aV"I have 75 children here in the orphanage, and it's total bedlam."
p299
aVThere's clothes, there's kids.
p300
aVThree adults and 75 kids \u2014 you can imagine.
p301
aVAnd he said, "The second day she was here she made up a list
p302
aVof all of the names of the older kids and the younger kids.
p303
aVAnd she assigned one of the older kids to each of the younger kids.
p304
aVAnd then she set up a work detail list of who cleaned the orphanage on what day."
p305
aVAnd he said, "She's telling me that I'm messy
p306
aVand I have to clean up my room."
p307
aVAnd he said, "I don't know who raised her, but she's running the orphanage,
p308
aVand she's been here three days."
p309
aa(lp310
V(Laughter)
p311
aa(lp312
VThis was movie day that she organized where all the kids went to the movies.
p313
aVA lot of the kids who had been adopted wrote back to the other kids,
p314
aVtelling them what their life was like with their new families.
p315
aVSo it was a really big deal when the letters showed up.
p316
aVThis is a woman who is now working at the orphanage,
p317
aVwhose son had been adopted.
p318
aVGene and Gayle started studying Korean
p319
aVthe moment they had gotten my first letter.
p320
aVThey really wanted to be able to welcome Eun-Sook into their family.
p321
aVAnd one of the things Father Keane told me
p322
aVwhen I came back from one of these trips \u2014
p323
aVEun-Sook had chosen the name Natasha,
p324
aVwhich I understood was from her watching a "Rocky and Bullwinkle" cartoon
p325
aVon the American Air Force station.
p326
aVThis may be one of those myth-buster things
p327
aVthat we'll have to clear up here, in a minute.
p328
aa(lp329
VSo, my friend Gene flew over with his son, Tim.
p330
aVGayle couldn't come.
p331
aVAnd they spent a lot of time huddled over a dictionary.
p332
aVAnd this was Gene showing the uncle
p333
aVwhere Atlanta was on the map, where he lived.
p334
aVThis is the uncle signing the adoption papers.
p335
aVNow, we went out to dinner that night to celebrate.
p336
aVThe uncle went back to his family
p337
aVand Natasha and Tim and Gene and I went out to dinner.
p338
aVAnd Gene was showing Natasha how to use a knife and fork,
p339
aVand then Natasha was returning the utensil lessons.
p340
aVWe went back to our hotel room,
p341
aVand Gene was showing Natasha also where Atlanta was.
p342
aVThis is the third night we were in Korea.
p343
aVThe first night we'd gotten a room for the kids right next to us.
p344
aa(lp345
VI'd been staying in this room for about three months \u2014
p346
aVit was a little 15-story Korean hotel.
p347
aVThe second night, we didn't keep the kids' room,
p348
aVbecause we slept on the floor with all the kids at the orphanage.
p349
aVAnd the third night, we came back \u2014
p350
aVwe'd just gone out to dinner, where you saw the pictures \u2014
p351
aVand we got to the front desk, and the guy said,
p352
aV"There's no other free rooms on your floor tonight,
p353
aVyou can put the kids five floors below you."
p354
aVAnd Gene and I looked at each other and said,
p355
aV"We don't want two 11-year-olds five floors away."
p356
aVSo his son said, "I have a sleeping bag, I'll sleep on the floor."
p357
aVAnd I said, "I have one too." So Tim and I slept on the floor,
p358
aVNatasha got one bed, Gene got the other \u2014 kids pass out,
p359
aVit's been very exciting for three days.
p360
aa(lp361
VWe're lying in bed, and Gene and I are talking about how cool we are.
p362
aVWe said, "That was so great, we saved this little girl's life."
p363
aVWe were just like, you know, just full of ourselves.
p364
aVAnd we fall asleep \u2014
p365
aVand I've been in this room for a couple of months now.
p366
aVAnd they always overheat the hotels in Korea terribly,
p367
aVso during the day I always left the window open.
p368
aVAnd then about midnight, they turn the heat off in the hotel.
p369
aVSo at 1am, the whole room would be like 20 below zero, and I'd get up.
p370
aVI'd been doing this every night I'd been there.
p371
aVSo, sure enough, it's one o'clock, room's freezing,
p372
aVI go to close the window and I hear people shouting outside,
p373
aVand I thought, "Oh, the bars must have just gotten out."
p374
aVI don't speak Korean, but I'm hearing these voices,
p375
aVand I'm not hearing anger, I'm hearing terror.
p376
aVSo I open the window and I look out,
p377
aVand there's flames coming up the side of our hotel,
p378
aVand the hotel's on fire.
p379
aVSo I run over to Gene and I wake him up,
p380
aVand I say, "Don't freak out, I think the hotel's on fire."
p381
aVAnd now there's smoke and flames coming by our windows \u2014
p382
aVwe're on the 11th floor.
p383
aVSo the two of us were just like, "Oh my God, oh my God."
p384
aa(lp385
VSo we're trying to get Natasha up, and we can't talk to her.
p386
aVYou know what kids are like when they've been asleep for like an hour,
p387
aVit's like they took five Valiums \u2014 they're all over the place.
p388
aVAnd we can't talk to her.
p389
aVHis son had the L.L.Bean bootlaces, and we're trying to do up his laces.
p390
aVSo we try to get to the door, we run to the door, we open the door,
p391
aVand it's like walking into a blast furnace.
p392
aVThere's people screaming, the sound of glass breaking, weird thumps.
p393
aVAnd the whole room filled with smoke in about two seconds.
p394
aVAnd Gene turns around and says, "We're not going to make it."
p395
aVAnd he closes the door, and the whole room is now filled with smoke.
p396
aVWe're all choking, and there's smoke
p397
aVpouring through the vents, under the doors.
p398
aVThere's people screaming.
p399
aVI just remember this unbelievable \u2014 just utter chaos.
p400
aa(lp401
VI remember sitting near the bed, and I had two overwhelming feelings.
p402
aVOne was absolute terror. "Oh, please God, I just want to wake up.
p403
aVThis has got to be a nightmare, this can't be happening.
p404
aVPlease, I just want to wake up."
p405
aVAnd the other is unbelievable guilt.
p406
aVHere I've been playing God with my friends' lives,
p407
aVmy friends' son, with Natasha's life,
p408
aVand this what you get when you try playing God, is you hurt people.
p409
aVI remember just being so frightened and terrified.
p410
aVAnd Gene, who's lying on the floor, says,
p411
aV"We've got to soak towels." I said, "What?"
p412
aV"We've got to soak towels. We're going to die from the smoke."
p413
aVSo got towels and put them over our faces and the kids' faces.
p414
aVThen he said, "Do you have gaffer's tape?"
p415
aV"What?" "Do you have gaffer's tape?"
p416
aVI said, "Somewhere in my Halliburton."
p417
aVHe says, "We've got to stop the smoke. That's all we can do."
p418
aVI mean, Gene \u2014 thank God for Gene.
p419
aVSo we put the room service menus over the vents in the wall,
p420
aVwe put blankets at the bottom of the door,
p421
aVwe put the kids on the windowsill to try to get some air.
p422
aVAnd there was a new building, going up,
p423
aVthat was being built right across the street from our hotel.
p424
aVAnd there, in the building, were photographers,
p425
aVwaiting for people to jump.
p426
aVEleven people ended up dying in the fire.
p427
aVFive people jumped and died, other people were killed by the smoke.
p428
aVAnd there's this loud thumping on the door after about 45 minutes in all this,
p429
aVand people were shouting in Korean.
p430
aVAnd I remember \u2014
p431
aVNatasha didn't want us opening the door \u2014
p432
aVsorry, I was trying not to open the door,
p433
aVbecause we'd spent so much time barricading the room.
p434
aVI didn't know who it was, I didn't know what they wanted,
p435
aVand Natasha could tell they were firemen trying to get us out.
p436
aVI remember a sort of a tussle at the door, trying to get the door open.
p437
aa(lp438
VIn any case, 12 hours later \u2014 I mean, they put us in the lobby.
p439
aVGene ended up using his coat, and his fist in the coat,
p440
aVto break open a liquor cabinet.
p441
aVPeople were lying on the floor.
p442
aVIt was one of just the most horrifying nights.
p443
aVAnd then 12 hours later, we rented a car, as we had planned to,
p444
aVand drove back to Natasha's village.
p445
aVAnd we kept saying, "Do you realize we were dying in a hotel fire,
p446
aVlike eight hours ago?"
p447
aVIt's so weird how life just goes on.
p448
aVNatasha wanted to introduce her brother and father to all the villagers,
p449
aVand the day we showed up turned out to be a 60-year-old man's birthday.
p450
aVThis guy's 60 years old.
p451
aVSo it turned into a dual celebration,
p452
aVbecause Natasha was the first person from this village
p453
aVever to go to the United States.
p454
aVSo, these are the greenhouse tents.
p455
aVThis is the elders teaching Gene their dances.
p456
aVWe drank a lot of rice wine.
p457
aVWe were both so drunk, I couldn't believe it.
p458
aa(lp459
VThis is the last picture before Gene and Tim headed back.
p460
aVThe adoption people told us
p461
aVit was going to take a year for the adoption to go through.
p462
aVLike, what could you do for a year?
p463
aVSo I found out the name of every official on both the Korean and American side,
p464
aVand I photographed them,
p465
aVand told them how famous they were going to be when this book was done.
p466
aVAnd four months later, the adoption papers came through.
p467
aVThis is saying goodbye to everybody at the orphanage.
p468
aVThis is Father Keane with Natasha at the bus stop.
p469
aVHer great aunt at the airport.
p470
aVI had a wonderful deal with Cathay Pacific airlines for many years,
p471
aVwhere they gave me free passes on all their airlines
p472
aVin return for photography.
p473
aVIt was like the ultimate perk.
p474
aVAnd the pilot, I actually knew \u2014
p475
aVbecause they used to let me sit in the jump seat,
p476
aVto tell you how long ago this was.
p477
aVThis is a TriStar, and so they let Natasha actually sit in the jump seat.
p478
aVAnd the pilot, Jeff Cowley, actually went back
p479
aVand adopted one of the other kids at the orphanage after meeting Natasha.
p480
aa(lp481
VThis is 28 hours later in Atlanta.
p482
aVIt's a very long flight.
p483
aVJust to make things even crazier, Gayle, Natasha's new mom,
p484
aVwas three days away from giving birth to her own daughter.
p485
aVYou know, if you were writing this, you'd say,
p486
aV"No, we've got to write the script differently."
p487
aVThis is the first night showing Natasha her new cousins and uncles and aunts.
p488
aVGene and Gayle know everyone in Atlanta \u2014 they're the most social couple imaginable.
p489
aVSo, at this point, Natasha doesn't speak a word of English,
p490
aVother than what little Father Keane taught her.
p491
aVThis is Kylie, her sister, who's now a doctor, on the right.
p492
aVThis is a deal I had with Natasha, which is that when we got to Atlanta
p493
aVshe could cut off my beard.
p494
aVShe never liked it very much.
p495
aa(lp496
VShe learned English in three months.
p497
aVShe entered seventh grade at her own age level.
p498
aVPledge of Allegiance for the first time.
p499
aVThis is her cooking teacher.
p500
aVNatasha told me a lot of the kids thought she was stuck up,
p501
aVbecause they would talk to her and she wouldn't answer,
p502
aVand they didn't realize she didn't speak English very well.
p503
aVBut what I noticed, again as an observer,
p504
aVwas she was choosing who was going to be on her team,
p505
aVand seemed to be very popular very, very quickly.
p506
aVNow, remember the picture,
p507
aVhow much she looked like her grandmother, at the beginning?
p508
aVPeople were always telling Natasha how much she looks like her mother, Gayle.
p509
aa(lp510
V(Laughter)
p511
aa(lp512
VThis is a tense moment in the first football game, I think.
p513
aVAnd Kylie \u2014 I mean, it was almost like Kylie was her own child.
p514
aVShe's being baptized.
p515
aVNow, a lot of parents, when they adopt,
p516
aVactually want to erase their children's history.
p517
aVAnd Gayle and Gene did the complete opposite.
p518
aVThey were studying Korean; they bought Korean clothes.
p519
aVGene even did a little tile work in the kitchen,
p520
aVwhich was that, "Once upon a time, there was a beautiful girl
p521
aVthat came from the hills of Korea to live happily ever after in Atlanta."
p522
aa(lp523
VShe hates this picture \u2014 it was her first job.
p524
aVShe bought a bright red Karmann Ghia
p525
aVwith the money she made working at Burger King.
p526
aVThe captain of the cheerleaders.
p527
aVBeauty pageant.
p528
aVUsed to do their Christmas card every year.
p529
aVGene's been restoring this car for a million years.
p530
aa(lp531
VKodak hired Natasha to be a translator for them at the Olympics in Korea.
p532
aVHer future husband, Jeff, was working for Canon cameras,
p533
aVand met Natasha at the Olympic Village.
p534
aVThis is her first trip back to Korea. So there's her uncle.
p535
aVThis is her half sister.
p536
aVShe went back to the village.
p537
aVThat's her best friend's mother.
p538
aVAnd I always thought that was a very Annie Hall kind of outfit.
p539
aa(lp540
V(Laughter)
p541
aa(lp542
VIt's just, you know, it was just so interesting, just to watch \u2014
p543
aVthis is her mother in the background there.
p544
aVThis is Natasha's wedding day.
p545
aVGene is looking a little older.
p546
aVThis is Sydney, who's going to be three years old in a couple of days.
p547
aVAnd there's Evan.
p548
aa(lp549
VAnd Natasha, would you just come up, for a second,
p550
aVjust maybe to say hello to everybody?
p551
aa(lp552
V(Applause)
p553
aa(lp554
VNatasha's actually never heard me tell the story.
p555
aVYou know, we've looked at the pictures together.
p556
aa(lp557
VNatasha: I've seen pictures millions of times,
p558
aVbut today was the first time I'm actually seeing him give the whole presentation.
p559
aVI started crying.
p560
aa(lp561
VRick Smolan: There's about 40 things she's going to tell me,
p562
aV"That wasn't what happened." Natasha: I'll tell you that later.
p563
aa(lp564
VRS: Anyway, thank you, Mike and Richard, so much for letting us tell the story.
p565
aa(lp566
VThank you, all of you.
