VI have a tough job to do.
p4
aVYou know, when I looked at the profile of the audience here,
p5
aVwith their connotations and design, in all its forms,
p6
aVand with so much and so many people working
p7
aVon collaborative and networks, and so on, that I wanted to tell you,
p8
aVI wanted to build an argument for primary education
p9
aVin a very specific context.
p10
aVIn order to do that in 20 minutes, I have to bring out four ideas \u2014
p11
aVit's like four pieces of a puzzle.
p12
aVAnd if I succeed in doing that,
p13
aVmaybe you would go back with the thought
p14
aVthat you could build on, and perhaps help me do my work.
p15
aa(lp16
VThe first piece of the puzzle is remoteness
p17
aVand the quality of education.
p18
aVNow, by remoteness, I mean two or three different kinds of things.
p19
aVOf course, remoteness in its normal sense, which means
p20
aVthat as you go further and further away
p21
aVfrom an urban center, you get to remoter areas.
p22
aVWhat happens to education?
p23
aVThe second, or a different kind of remoteness
p24
aVis that within the large metropolitan areas all over the world,
p25
aVyou have pockets, like slums, or shantytowns, or poorer areas,
p26
aVwhich are socially and economically remote
p27
aVfrom the rest of the city, so it's us and them.
p28
aVWhat happens to education in that context?
p29
aVSo keep both of those ideas of remoteness.
p30
aa(lp31
VWe made a guess. The guess was that schools in remote areas
p32
aVdo not have good enough teachers.
p33
aVIf they do have, they cannot retain those teachers.
p34
aVThey do not have good enough infrastructure.
p35
aVAnd if they had some infrastructure,
p36
aVthey have difficulty maintaining it.
p37
aVBut I wanted to check if this is true. So what I did last year was
p38
aVwe hired a car, looked up on Google,
p39
aVfound a route into northern India from New Delhi
p40
aVwhich, you know, which did not cross any big cities
p41
aVor any big metropolitan centers. Drove out about 300 kilometers,
p42
aVand wherever we found a school, administered a set of standard tests,
p43
aVand then took those test results and plotted them on a graph.
p44
aVThe graph was interesting, although you need to consider it carefully.
p45
aVI mean, this is a very small sample; you should not generalize from it.
p46
aVBut it was quite obvious, quite clear,
p47
aVthat for this particular route that I had taken,
p48
aVthe remoter the school was, the worse its results seemed to be.
p49
aVThat seemed a little damning,
p50
aVand I tried to correlate it with things like infrastructure,
p51
aVor with the availability of electricity, and things like that.
p52
aa(lp53
VTo my surprise, it did not correlate.
p54
aVIt did not correlate with the size of classrooms.
p55
aVIt did not correlate with the quality of the infrastructure.
p56
aVIt did not correlate with the poverty levels. It did not correlate.
p57
aVBut what happened was that when I administered a questionnaire
p58
aVto each of these schools, with one single question for the teachers \u2014 which was,
p59
aV"Would you like to move to an urban, metropolitan area?" \u2014
p60
aV69 percent of them said yes. And as you can see from that,
p61
aVthey say yes just a little bit out of Delhi,
p62
aVand they say no when you hit the rich suburbs of Delhi \u2014
p63
aVbecause, you know, those are relatively better off areas \u2014
p64
aVand then from 200 kilometers out of Delhi, the answer is consistently yes.
p65
aVI would imagine that a teacher who comes or walks into class
p66
aVevery day thinking that, I wish I was in some other school,
p67
aVprobably has a deep impact on what happens to the results.
p68
aVSo it looked as though teacher motivation and teacher migration
p69
aVwas a powerfully correlated thing with what was happening in primary schools,
p70
aVas opposed to whether the children have enough to eat,
p71
aVand whether they are packed tightly into classrooms
p72
aVand that sort of thing. It appears that way.
p73
aa(lp74
VWhen you take education and technology, then I find in the literature that,
p75
aVyou know, things like websites, collaborative environments \u2014
p76
aVyou've been listening to all that in the morning \u2014
p77
aVit's always piloted first in the best schools, the best urban schools,
p78
aVand, according to me, biases the result.
p79
aVThe literature \u2014 one part of it, the scientific literature \u2014
p80
aVconsistently blames ET as being over-hyped and under-performing.
p81
aVThe teachers always say, well, it's fine, but it's too expensive for what it does.
p82
aVBecause it's being piloted in a school where the students are already getting,
p83
aVlet's say, 80 percent of whatever they could do.
p84
aVYou put in this new super-duper technology, and now they get 83 percent.
p85
aVSo the principal looks at it and says,
p86
aV3 percent for 300,000 dollars? Forget it.
p87
aVIf you took the same technology and piloted it into one of those remote schools,
p88
aVwhere the score was 30 percent, and, let's say, took that up to 40 percent \u2014
p89
aVthat will be a completely different thing.
p90
aVSo the relative change that ET, Educational Technology, would make,
p91
aVwould be far greater at the bottom of the pyramid than at the top,
p92
aVbut we seem to be doing it the other way about.
p93
aa(lp94
VSo I came to this conclusion that ET should reach
p95
aVthe underprivileged first, not the other way about.
p96
aVAnd finally came the question of, how do you tackle teacher perception?
p97
aVWhenever you go to a teacher and show them some technology,
p98
aVthe teacher's first reaction is,
p99
aVyou cannot replace a teacher with a machine \u2014 it's impossible.
p100
aVI don't know why it's impossible, but, even for a moment,
p101
aVif you did assume that it's impossible \u2014 I have a quotation from Sir Arthur C. Clarke,
p102
aVthe science fiction writer whom I met in Colombo,
p103
aVand he said something which completely solves this problem.
p104
aVHe said a teacher than can be replaced by a machine, should be.
p105
aVSo, you know, it puts the teacher into a tough bind, you have to think.
p106
aVAnyway, so I'm proposing that an alternative primary education,
p107
aVwhatever alternative you want, is required where schools don't exist,
p108
aVwhere schools are not good enough, where teachers are not available
p109
aVor where teachers are not good enough, for whatever reason.
p110
aVIf you happen to live in a part of the world where none of this applies,
p111
aVthen you don't need an alternative education.
p112
aVSo far I haven't come across such an area, except for one case. I won't name the area,
p113
aVbut somewhere in the world people said, we don't have this problem,
p114
aVbecause we have perfect teachers and perfect schools.
p115
aVThere are such areas, but \u2014 anyway, I'd never heard that anywhere else.
p116
aa(lp117
VI'm going to talk about children and self-organization,
p118
aVand a set of experiments which sort of led to this idea
p119
aVof what might an alternative education be like.
p120
aVThey're called the hole-in-the-wall experiments.
p121
aVI'll have to really rush through this. They're a set of experiments.
p122
aVThe first one was done in New Delhi in 1999.
p123
aVAnd what we did over there was pretty much simple.
p124
aVI had an office in those days which bordered a slum, an urban slum,
p125
aVso there was a dividing wall between our office and the urban slum.
p126
aVThey cut a hole inside that wall \u2014
p127
aVwhich is how it has got the name hole-in-the-wall \u2014
p128
aVand put a pretty powerful PC into that hole, sort of embedded into the wall
p129
aVso that its monitor was sticking out at the other end,
p130
aVa touchpad similarly embedded into the wall,
p131
aVput it on high-speed Internet, put the Internet Explorer there,
p132
aVput it on Altavista.com \u2014 in those days \u2014 and just left it there.
p133
aa(lp134
VAnd this is what we saw.
p135
aVSo that was my office in IIT. Here's the hole-in-the-wall.
p136
aVAbout eight hours later, we found this kid.
p137
aVTo the right is this eight-year-old child who \u2014
p138
aVand to his left is a six-year-old girl, who is not very tall.
p139
aVAnd what he was doing was, he was teaching her to browse.
p140
aVSo it sort of raised more questions than it answered.
p141
aVIs this real? Does the language matter,
p142
aVbecause he's not supposed to know English?
p143
aVWill the computer last, or will they break it and steal it
p144
aV\u2014 and did anyone teach them?
p145
aVThe last question is what everybody said, but you know,
p146
aVI mean, they must have poked their head over the wall
p147
aVand asked the people in your office,
p148
aVcan you show me how to do it, and then somebody taught him.
p149
aa(lp150
VSo I took the experiment out of Delhi and repeated it,
p151
aVthis time in a city called Shivpuri in the center of India,
p152
aVwhere I was assured that nobody had ever taught anybody anything.
p153
aV(Laughter)
p154
aVSo it was a warm day, and the hole in the wall
p155
aVwas on that decrepit old building. This is the first kid who came there;
p156
aVhe later on turned out to be a 13-year-old school dropout.
p157
aVHe came there and he started to fiddle around with the touchpad.
p158
aVVery quickly, he noticed that when he moves his finger on the touchpad
p159
aVsomething moves on the screen \u2014
p160
aVand later on he told me, "I have never seen a television
p161
aVwhere you can do something."
p162
aVSo he figured that out. It took him over two minutes
p163
aVto figure out that he was doing things to the television.
p164
aVAnd then, as he was doing that, he made an accidental click
p165
aVby hitting the touchpad \u2014 you'll see him do that.
p166
aVHe did that, and the Internet Explorer changed page.
p167
aVEight minutes later, he looked from his hand to the screen,
p168
aVand he was browsing: he was going back and forth.
p169
aVWhen that happened, he started calling all the neighborhood children,
p170
aVlike, children would come and see what's happening over here.
p171
aVAnd by the evening of that day, 70 children were all browsing.
p172
aVSo eight minutes and an embedded computer
p173
aVseemed to be all that we needed there.
p174
aa(lp175
VSo we thought that this is what was happening:
p176
aVthat children in groups can self-instruct themselves
p177
aVto use a computer and the Internet. But under what circumstances?
p178
aVAt this time there was a \u2014 the main question was about English.
p179
aVPeople said, you know, you really ought to have this in Indian languages.
p180
aVSo I said, have what, shall I translate the Internet
p181
aVinto some Indian language? That's not possible.
p182
aVSo, it has to be the other way about.
p183
aVBut let's see, how do the children tackle the English language?
p184
aVI took the experiment out to northeastern India,
p185
aVto a village called Madantusi,
p186
aVwhere, for some reason, there was no English teacher,
p187
aVso the children had not learned English at all.
p188
aVAnd I built a similar hole-in-the-wall.
p189
aVOne big difference in the villages, as opposed to the urban slums:
p190
aVthere were more girls than boys who came to the kiosk.
p191
aVIn the urban slums, the girls tend to stay away.
p192
aVI left the computer there with lots of CDs \u2014 I didn't have any Internet \u2014
p193
aVand came back three months later.
p194
aVSo when I came back there, I found these two kids,
p195
aVeight- and 12-year-olds, who were playing a game on the computer.
p196
aVAnd as soon as they saw me they said,
p197
aV"We need a faster processor and a better mouse."
p198
aV(Laughter)
p199
aVI was real surprised.
p200
aVYou know, how on earth did they know all this?
p201
aVAnd they said, "Well, we've picked it up from the CDs."
p202
aVSo I said, "But how did you understand what's going on over there?"
p203
aVSo they said, "Well, you've left this machine
p204
aVwhich talks only in English, so we had to learn English."
p205
aVSo then I measured, and they were using 200 English words with each other
p206
aV\u2014 mispronounced, but correct usage \u2014
p207
aVwords like exit, stop, find, save, that kind of thing,
p208
aVnot only to do with the computer but in their day-to-day conversations.
p209
aVSo, Madantusi seemed to show that language is not a barrier;
p210
aVin fact they may be able to teach themselves the language
p211
aVif they really wanted to.
p212
aa(lp213
VFinally, I got some funding to try this experiment out
p214
aVto see if these results are replicable, if they happen everywhere else.
p215
aVIndia is a good place to do such an experiment in,
p216
aVbecause we have all the ethnic diversities, all the \u2014 you know,
p217
aVthe genetic diversity, all the racial diversities,
p218
aVand also all the socio-economic diversities.
p219
aVSo, I could actually choose samples to cover a cross section
p220
aVthat would cover practically the whole world.
p221
aVSo I did this for almost five years, and this experiment
p222
aVreally took us all the way across the length and breadth of India.
p223
aVThis is the Himalayas. Up in the north, very cold.
p224
aVI also had to check or invent an engineering design
p225
aVwhich would survive outdoors, and I was using regular, normal PCs,
p226
aVso I needed different climates, for which India is also great,
p227
aVbecause we have very cold, very hot, and so on.
p228
aVThis is the desert to the west. Near the Pakistan border.
p229
aVAnd you see here a little clip of \u2014 one of these villages \u2014
p230
aVthe first thing that these children did was to find a website
p231
aVto teach themselves the English alphabet.
p232
aa(lp233
VThen to central India \u2014 very warm, moist, fishing villages,
p234
aVwhere humidity is a very big killer of electronics.
p235
aVSo we had to solve all the problems we had
p236
aVwithout air conditioning and with very poor power,
p237
aVso most of the solutions that came out used little blasts of air
p238
aVput at the right places to keep the machines running.
p239
aVI want to just cut this short. We did this over and over again.
p240
aVThis sequence is also nice. This is a small child, a six-year-old,
p241
aVtelling his eldest sister what to do.
p242
aVAnd this happens very often with these computers,
p243
aVthat the younger children are found teaching the older ones.
p244
aa(lp245
VWhat did we find? We found that six- to 13-year-olds can self-instruct
p246
aVin a connected environment,
p247
aVirrespective of anything that we could measure.
p248
aVSo if they have access to the computer, they will teach themselves, including intelligence.
p249
aVI couldn't find a single correlation with anything, but it had to be in groups.
p250
aVAnd that may be of great, you know, interest to this group,
p251
aVbecause all of you are talking about groups.
p252
aVSo here was the power of what a group of children can do,
p253
aVif you lift the adult intervention.
p254
aa(lp255
VJust a quick idea of the measurements.
p256
aVWe took standard statistical techniques, so I'm going to not talk about that.
p257
aVBut we got a clean learning curve,
p258
aValmost exactly the same as what you would get in a school.
p259
aVI'll leave it at that,
p260
aVbecause, I mean, it sort of says it all, doesn't it?
p261
aVWhat could they learn to do?
p262
aVBasic Windows functions, browsing, painting, chatting and email,
p263
aVgames and educational material, music downloads, playing video.
p264
aVIn short, what all of us do.
p265
aVAnd over 300 children will become computer literate
p266
aVand be able to do all of these things in six months with one computer.
p267
aa(lp268
VSo, how do they do that?
p269
aVIf you calculated the actual time of access,
p270
aVit would work out to minutes per day,
p271
aVso that's not how it's happening.
p272
aVWhat you have, actually, is there is one child operating the computer.
p273
aVAnd surrounding him are usually three other children,
p274
aVwho are advising him on what they should do.
p275
aVIf you test them, all four will get the same scores in whatever you ask them.
p276
aVAround these four are usually a group of about 16 children,
p277
aVwho are also advising, usually wrongly,
p278
aVabout everything that's going on on the computer.
p279
aVAnd all of them also will clear a test given on that subject.
p280
aVSo they are learning as much by watching as they learn by doing.
p281
aVIt seems counter-intuitive to adult learning,
p282
aVbut remember, eight-year-olds live in a society
p283
aVwhere most of the time they are told, don't do this,
p284
aVyou know, don't touch the whiskey bottle.
p285
aVSo what does the eight-year-old do?
p286
aVHe observes very carefully how a whiskey bottle should be touched.
p287
aVAnd if you tested him,
p288
aVhe would answer every question correctly on that topic.
p289
aVSo, they seem to be able to acquire very quickly.
p290
aa(lp291
VSo what was the conclusion over the six years of work?
p292
aVIt was that primary education can happen on its own,
p293
aVor parts of it can happen on its own.
p294
aVIt does not have to be imposed from the top downwards.
p295
aVIt could perhaps be a self-organizing system, so that was
p296
aVthe second bit that I wanted to tell you,
p297
aVthat children can self-organize and attain an educational objective.
p298
aa(lp299
VThe third piece was on values, and again, to put it very briefly,
p300
aVI conducted a test over 500 children spread across all over India,
p301
aVand asked them \u2014 I gave them about 68 different
p302
aVvalues-oriented questions and simply asked them their opinions.
p303
aVWe got all sorts of opinions. Yes, no or I don't know.
p304
aVI simply took those questions where I got 50 percent yeses and 50 percent noes \u2014
p305
aVso I was able to get a collection of 16 such statements.
p306
aVThese were areas where the children were clearly confused,
p307
aVbecause half said yes and half said no.
p308
aVA typical example being, "Sometimes it is necessary to tell lies."
p309
aVThey don't have a way to determine which way to answer this question;
p310
aVperhaps none of us do.
p311
aVSo I leave you with this third question.
p312
aVCan technology alter the acquisition of values?
p313
aVFinally, self-organizing systems,
p314
aVabout which, again, I won't say too much
p315
aVbecause you've been hearing all about it.
p316
aVNatural systems are all self-organizing:
p317
aVgalaxies, molecules, cells, organisms, societies \u2014
p318
aVexcept for the debate about an intelligent designer.
p319
aVBut at this point in time, as far as science goes,
p320
aVit's self-organization.
p321
aVBut other examples are traffic jams, stock market, society
p322
aVand disaster recovery, terrorism and insurgency.
p323
aVAnd you know about the Internet-based self-organizing systems.
p324
aa(lp325
VSo here are my four sentences then.
p326
aVRemoteness affects the quality of education.
p327
aVEducational technology should be introduced into remote areas first,
p328
aVand other areas later.
p329
aVValues are acquired; doctrine and dogma are imposed \u2014
p330
aVthe two opposing mechanisms.
p331
aVAnd learning is most likely a self-organizing system.
p332
aVIf you put all the four together, then it gives \u2014 according to me \u2014
p333
aVit gives us a goal, a vision, for educational technology.
p334
aVAn educational technology and pedagogy that is digital, automatic,
p335
aVfault-tolerant, minimally invasive, connected and self-organized.
p336
aVAs educationists, we have never asked for technology; we keep borrowing it.
p337
aVPowerPoint is supposed to be considered a great educational technology,
p338
aVbut it was not meant for education, it was meant for making boardroom presentations.
p339
aVWe borrowed it. Video conferencing. The personal computer itself.
p340
aVI think it's time that the educationists made their own specs,
p341
aVand I have such a set of specs. This is a brief look at that.
p342
aVAnd such a set of specs should produce the technology
p343
aVto address remoteness, values and violence.
p344
aVSo I thought I'd give it a name \u2014 why don't we call it "outdoctrination."
p345
aVAnd could this be a goal for educational technology in the future?
p346
aVSo I want to leave that as a thought with you.
p347
