VAs a singer-songwriter,
p4
aVpeople often ask me about my influences or, as I like to call them,
p5
aVmy sonic lineages.
p6
aVAnd I could easily tell you
p7
aVthat I was shaped by the jazz and hip hop that I grew up with,
p8
aVby the Ethiopian heritage of my ancestors,
p9
aVor by the 1980s pop on my childhood radio stations.
p10
aVBut beyond genre, there is another question:
p11
aVhow do the sounds we hear every day influence the music that we make?
p12
aVI believe that everyday soundscape
p13
aVcan be the most unexpected inspiration for songwriting,
p14
aVand to look at this idea a little bit more closely,
p15
aVI'm going to talk today about three things:
p16
aVnature, language and silence \u2014
p17
aVor rather, the impossibility of true silence.
p18
aVAnd through this I hope to give you a sense of a world
p19
aValready alive with musical expression,
p20
aVwith each of us serving as active participants,
p21
aVwhether we know it or not.
p22
aa(lp23
VI'm going to start today with nature, but before we do that,
p24
aVlet's quickly listen to this snippet of an opera singer warming up.
p25
aVHere it is.
p26
aa(lp27
V(Singing)
p28
aa(lp29
V(Singing ends)
p30
aa(lp31
VIt's beautiful, isn't it?
p32
aVGotcha!
p33
aVThat is actually not the sound of an opera singer warming up.
p34
aVThat is the sound of a bird
p35
aVslowed down to a pace
p36
aVthat the human ear mistakenly recognizes as its own.
p37
aVIt was released as part of Peter Szöke's 1987 Hungarian recording
p38
aV"The Unknown Music of Birds,"
p39
aVwhere he records many birds and slows down their pitches
p40
aVto reveal what's underneath.
p41
aVLet's listen to the full-speed recording.
p42
aa(lp43
V(Bird singing)
p44
aa(lp45
VNow, let's hear the two of them together
p46
aVso your brain can juxtapose them.
p47
aa(lp48
V(Bird singing at slow then full speed)
p49
aa(lp50
V(Singing ends)
p51
aa(lp52
VIt's incredible.
p53
aVPerhaps the techniques of opera singing were inspired by birdsong.
p54
aVAs humans, we intuitively understand birds to be our musical teachers.
p55
aa(lp56
VIn Ethiopia, birds are considered an integral part
p57
aVof the origin of music itself.
p58
aVThe story goes like this:
p59
aV1,500 years ago, a young man was born in the Empire of Aksum,
p60
aVa major trading center of the ancient world.
p61
aVHis name was Yared.
p62
aVWhen Yared was seven years old his father died,
p63
aVand his mother sent him to go live with an uncle, who was a priest
p64
aVof the Ethiopian Orthodox tradition,
p65
aVone of the oldest churches in the world.
p66
aVNow, this tradition has an enormous amount of scholarship and learning,
p67
aVand Yared had to study and study and study and study,
p68
aVand one day he was studying under a tree,
p69
aVwhen three birds came to him.
p70
aVOne by one, these birds became his teachers.
p71
aVThey taught him music \u2014 scales, in fact.
p72
aVAnd Yared, eventually recognized as Saint Yared,
p73
aVused these scales to compose five volumes of chants and hymns
p74
aVfor worship and celebration.
p75
aVAnd he used these scales to compose and to create
p76
aVan indigenous musical notation system.
p77
aVAnd these scales evolved into what is known as kiñit,
p78
aVthe unique, pentatonic, five-note, modal system that is very much alive
p79
aVand thriving and still evolving in Ethiopia today.
p80
aa(lp81
VNow, I love this story because it's true at multiple levels.
p82
aVSaint Yared was a real, historical figure,
p83
aVand the natural world can be our musical teacher.
p84
aVAnd we have so many examples of this:
p85
aVthe Pygmies of the Congo tune their instruments
p86
aVto the pitches of the birds in the forest around them.
p87
aVMusician and natural soundscape expert Bernie Krause describes
p88
aVhow a healthy environment has animals and insects
p89
aVtaking up low, medium and high-frequency bands,
p90
aVin exactly the same way as a symphony does.
p91
aVAnd countless works of music were inspired by bird and forest song.
p92
aVYes, the natural world can be our cultural teacher.
p93
aa(lp94
VSo let's go now to the uniquely human world of language.
p95
aVEvery language communicates with pitch to varying degrees,
p96
aVwhether it's Mandarin Chinese,
p97
aVwhere a shift in melodic inflection gives the same phonetic syllable
p98
aVan entirely different meaning,
p99
aVto a language like English,
p100
aVwhere a raised pitch at the end of a sentence ...
p101
aV(Going up in pitch) implies a question?
p102
aa(lp103
V(Laughter)
p104
aa(lp105
VAs an Ethiopian-American woman,
p106
aVI grew up around the language of Amharic, Amhariña.
p107
aVIt was my first language, the language of my parents,
p108
aVone of the main languages of Ethiopia.
p109
aVAnd there are a million reasons to fall in love with this language:
p110
aVits depth of poetics, its double entendres,
p111
aVits wax and gold, its humor,
p112
aVits proverbs that illuminate the wisdom and follies of life.
p113
aVBut there's also this melodicism, a musicality built right in.
p114
aVAnd I find this distilled most clearly
p115
aVin what I like to call emphatic language \u2014
p116
aVlanguage that's meant to highlight or underline
p117
aVor that springs from surprise.
p118
aVTake, for example, the word: "indey."
p119
aVNow, if there are Ethiopians in the audience,
p120
aVthey're probably chuckling to themselves,
p121
aVbecause the word means something like "No!"
p122
aVor "How could he?" or "No, he didn't."
p123
aVIt kind of depends on the situation.
p124
aVBut when I was a kid, this was my very favorite word,
p125
aVand I think it's because it has a pitch.
p126
aVIt has a melody.
p127
aVYou can almost see the shape as it springs from someone's mouth.
p128
aV"Indey" \u2014 it dips, and then raises again.
p129
aVAnd as a musician and composer, when I hear that word,
p130
aVsomething like this is floating through my mind.
p131
aa(lp132
V(Music and singing "Indey")
p133
aa(lp134
V(Music ends)
p135
aa(lp136
VOr take, for example, the phrase for "It is right" or "It is correct" \u2014
p137
aV"Lickih nehu ... Lickih nehu."
p138
aVIt's an affirmation, an agreement.
p139
aV"Lickih nehu."
p140
aVWhen I hear that phrase,
p141
aVsomething like this starts rolling through my mind.
p142
aa(lp143
V(Music and singing "Lickih nehu")
p144
aa(lp145
V(Music ends)
p146
aa(lp147
VAnd in both of those cases, what I did was I took the melody
p148
aVand the phrasing of those words and phrases
p149
aVand I turned them into musical parts to use in these short compositions.
p150
aVAnd I like to write bass lines,
p151
aVso they both ended up kind of as bass lines.
p152
aa(lp153
VNow, this is based on the work of Jason Moran and others
p154
aVwho work intimately with music and language,
p155
aVbut it's also something I've had in my head since I was a kid,
p156
aVhow musical my parents sounded
p157
aVwhen they were speaking to each other and to us.
p158
aVIt was from them and from Amhariña that I learned
p159
aVthat we are awash in musical expression
p160
aVwith every word, every sentence that we speak,
p161
aVevery word, every sentence that we receive.
p162
aVPerhaps you can hear it in the words I'm speaking even now.
p163
aa(lp164
VFinally, we go to the 1950s United States
p165
aVand the most seminal work of 20th century avant-garde composition:
p166
aVJohn Cage's "4:33,"
p167
aVwritten for any instrument or combination of instruments.
p168
aVThe musician or musicians are invited to walk onto the stage
p169
aVwith a stopwatch and open the score,
p170
aVwhich was actually purchased by the Museum of Modern Art \u2014
p171
aVthe score, that is.
p172
aVAnd this score has not a single note written
p173
aVand there is not a single note played
p174
aVfor four minutes and 33 seconds.
p175
aVAnd, at once enraging and enrapturing,
p176
aVCage shows us that even when there are no strings
p177
aVbeing plucked by fingers or hands hammering piano keys,
p178
aVstill there is music, still there is music,
p179
aVstill there is music.
p180
aVAnd what is this music?
p181
aVIt was that sneeze in the back.
p182
aa(lp183
V(Laughter)
p184
aa(lp185
VIt is the everyday soundscape that arises from the audience themselves:
p186
aVtheir coughs, their sighs, their rustles, their whispers, their sneezes,
p187
aVthe room, the wood of the floors and the walls
p188
aVexpanding and contracting, creaking and groaning
p189
aVwith the heat and the cold,
p190
aVthe pipes clanking and contributing.
p191
aVAnd controversial though it was, and even controversial though it remains,
p192
aVCage's point is that there is no such thing as true silence.
p193
aVEven in the most silent environments, we still hear and feel the sound
p194
aVof our own heartbeats.
p195
aVThe world is alive with musical expression.
p196
aVWe are already immersed.
p197
aa(lp198
VNow, I had my own moment of, let's say, remixing John Cage
p199
aVa couple of months ago
p200
aVwhen I was standing in front of the stove cooking lentils.
p201
aVAnd it was late one night and it was time to stir,
p202
aVso I lifted the lid off the cooking pot,
p203
aVand I placed it onto the kitchen counter next to me,
p204
aVand it started to roll back and forth
p205
aVmaking this sound.
p206
aa(lp207
V(Sound of metal lid clanking against a counter)
p208
aa(lp209
V(Clanking ends)
p210
aa(lp211
VAnd it stopped me cold.
p212
aVI thought, "What a weird, cool swing that cooking pan lid has."
p213
aVSo when the lentils were ready and eaten,
p214
aVI hightailed it to my backyard studio,
p215
aVand I made this.
p216
aa(lp217
V(Music, including the sound of the lid, and singing)
p218
aa(lp219
V(Music ends)
p220
aa(lp221
VNow, John Cage wasn't instructing musicians
p222
aVto mine the soundscape for sonic textures to turn into music.
p223
aVHe was saying that on its own,
p224
aVthe environment is musically generative,
p225
aVthat it is generous, that it is fertile,
p226
aVthat we are already immersed.
p227
aa(lp228
VMusician, music researcher, surgeon and human hearing expert Charles Limb
p229
aVis a professor at Johns Hopkins University
p230
aVand he studies music and the brain.
p231
aVAnd he has a theory
p232
aVthat it is possible \u2014 it is possible \u2014
p233
aVthat the human auditory system actually evolved to hear music,
p234
aVbecause it is so much more complex than it needs to be for language alone.
p235
aVAnd if that's true,
p236
aVit means that we're hard-wired for music,
p237
aVthat we can find it anywhere,
p238
aVthat there is no such thing as a musical desert,
p239
aVthat we are permanently hanging out at the oasis,
p240
aVand that is marvelous.
p241
aVWe can add to the soundtrack, but it's already playing.
p242
aa(lp243
VAnd it doesn't mean don't study music.
p244
aVStudy music, trace your sonic lineages and enjoy that exploration.
p245
aVBut there is a kind of sonic lineage to which we all belong.
p246
aVSo the next time you are seeking percussion inspiration,
p247
aVlook no further than your tires, as they roll over the unusual grooves
p248
aVof the freeway,
p249
aVor the top-right burner of your stove
p250
aVand that strange way that it clicks
p251
aVas it is preparing to light.
p252
aVWhen seeking melodic inspiration,
p253
aVlook no further than dawn and dusk avian orchestras
p254
aVor to the natural lilt of emphatic language.
p255
aVWe are the audience and we are the composers
p256
aVand we take from these pieces
p257
aVwe are given.
p258
aVWe make, we make, we make, we make,
p259
aVknowing that when it comes to nature or language or soundscape,
p260
aVthere is no end to the inspiration \u2014
p261
aVif we are listening.
p262
