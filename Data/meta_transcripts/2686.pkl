VMost of you can probably relate to what I'm feeling right now.
p4
aVMy heart is racing in my chest.
p5
aVMy palms are a little bit clammy.
p6
aVI'm sweating.
p7
aVAnd my breath is a little bit shallow.
p8
aVNow, these familiar sensations are obviously the result
p9
aVof standing up in front of a thousand of you
p10
aVand giving a talk that might be streamed online
p11
aVto perhaps a million more.
p12
aVBut the physical sensations I'm experiencing right now
p13
aVare actually the result of a much more basic mind-body mechanism.
p14
aVMy nervous system is sending a flood of hormones
p15
aVlike cortisol and adrenaline into my bloodstream.
p16
aVIt's a very old and very necessary response that sends blood and oxygen
p17
aVto the organs and muscles that I might need
p18
aVto respond quickly to a potential threat.
p19
aa(lp20
VBut there's a problem with this response,
p21
aVand that is, it can get over-activated.
p22
aVIf I face these kinds of stressors on a daily basis,
p23
aVparticularly over an extended period of time,
p24
aVmy system can get overloaded.
p25
aVSo basically, if this response happens infrequently: super-necessary
p26
aVfor my well-being and survival.
p27
aVBut if it happens too much,
p28
aVit can actually make me sick.
p29
aa(lp30
VThere's a growing body of research examining the relationship
p31
aVbetween chronic stress and illness.
p32
aVThings like heart disease and even cancer
p33
aVare being shown to have a relationship to stress.
p34
aVAnd that's because, over time, too much activation from stress
p35
aVcan interfere with my body's processes that keep me healthy.
p36
aa(lp37
VNow, let's imagine for a moment that I was pregnant.
p38
aVWhat might this kind of stress,
p39
aVparticularly over the length of my pregnancy,
p40
aVwhat kind of impact might that have
p41
aVon the health of my developing fetus?
p42
aVYou probably won't be surprised when I tell you
p43
aVthat this kind of stress during pregnancy is not good.
p44
aVIt can even cause the body to initiate labor too early,
p45
aVbecause in a basic sense, the stress communicates
p46
aVthat the womb is no longer a safe place for the child.
p47
aVStress during pregnancy is linked with things like high blood pressure
p48
aVand low infant birth weight,
p49
aVand it can begin a cascade of health challenges
p50
aVthat make birth much more dangerous
p51
aVfor both parent and child.
p52
aa(lp53
VNow of course stress, particularly in our modern lifestyle,
p54
aVis a somewhat universal experience, right?
p55
aVMaybe you've never stood up to give a TED Talk,
p56
aVbut you've faced a big presentation at work,
p57
aVa sudden job loss,
p58
aVa big test,
p59
aVa heated conflict with a family member or friend.
p60
aVBut it turns out that the kind of stress we experience
p61
aVand whether we're able to stay in a relaxed state long enough
p62
aVto keep our bodies working properly
p63
aVdepends a lot on who we are.
p64
aVThere's also a growing body of research
p65
aVshowing that people who experience more discrimination
p66
aVare more likely to have poor health.
p67
aVEven the threat of discrimination,
p68
aVlike worrying you might be stopped by police while driving your car,
p69
aVcan have a negative impact on your health.
p70
aVHarvard Professor Dr. David Williams,
p71
aVthe person who pioneered the tools that have proven these linkages,
p72
aVsays that the more marginalized groups in our society
p73
aVexperience more discrimination and more impacts on their health.
p74
aa(lp75
VI've been interested in these issues for over a decade.
p76
aVI became interested in maternal health
p77
aVwhen a failed premed trajectory instead sent me down a path
p78
aVlooking for other ways to help pregnant people.
p79
aVI became a doula,
p80
aVa lay person trained to provide support
p81
aVto people during pregnancy and childbirth.
p82
aVAnd because I'm Latina and a Spanish speaker,
p83
aVin my first volunteer doula gig at a public hospital in North Carolina,
p84
aVI saw clearly how race and class impacted the experiences
p85
aVof the women that I supported.
p86
aa(lp87
VIf we take a look at the statistics about the rates of illness
p88
aVduring pregnancy and childbirth,
p89
aVwe see clearly the pattern outlined by Dr. Williams.
p90
aVAfrican-American women in particular
p91
aVhave an entirely different experience than white women
p92
aVwhen it comes to whether their babies are born healthy.
p93
aVIn certain parts of the country, particularly the Deep South,
p94
aVthe rates of mother and infant death for black women
p95
aVactually approximate those rates in Sub-Saharan African.
p96
aVIn those same communities,
p97
aVthe rates for white women are near zero.
p98
aa(lp99
VEven nationally, black women are four times more likely
p100
aVto die during pregnancy and childbirth
p101
aVthan white women.
p102
aVFour times more likely to die.
p103
aVThey're also twice as likely for their infants to die
p104
aVbefore the first year of life
p105
aVthan white infants,
p106
aVand two to three times more likely
p107
aVto give birth too early or too skinny \u2014
p108
aVa sign of insufficient development.
p109
aVNative women are also more likely to have higher rates of these problems
p110
aVthan white women,
p111
aVas are some groups of Latinas.
p112
aVFor the last decade as a doula turned journalist and blogger,
p113
aVI've been trying to raise the alarm
p114
aVabout just how different the experiences of women of color,
p115
aVbut particularly black women,
p116
aVare when it comes to pregnancy and birth in the US.
p117
aa(lp118
VBut when I tell people about these appalling statistics,
p119
aVI'm usually met with an assumption that it's about either poverty
p120
aVor lack of access to care.
p121
aVBut it turns out, neither of these things tell the whole story.
p122
aVEven middle-class black women still have much worse outcomes
p123
aVthan their middle-class white counterparts.
p124
aVThe gap actually widens among this group.
p125
aVAnd while access to care is definitely still a problem,
p126
aVeven women of color who receive the recommended prenatal care
p127
aVstill suffer from these high rates.
p128
aa(lp129
VAnd so we come back to the path
p130
aVfrom discrimination to stress to poor health,
p131
aVand it begins to paint a picture that many people of color know to be true:
p132
aVracism is actually making us sick.
p133
aVStill sound like a stretch?
p134
aVConsider this: immigrants, particularly black and Latina immigrants,
p135
aVactually have better health when they first arrive in the United States.
p136
aVBut the longer they stay in this country, the worse their health becomes.
p137
aVPeople like me, born in the United States to Cuban immigrant parents,
p138
aVare actually more likely to have worse health than my grandparents did.
p139
aVIt's what researchers call "the immigrant paradox,"
p140
aVand it further illustrates
p141
aVthat there's something in the US environment
p142
aVthat is making us sick.
p143
aa(lp144
VBut here's the thing:
p145
aVthis problem, that racism is making people of color,
p146
aVbut especially black women and babies, sick, is vast.
p147
aVI could spend all of my time with you talking about it,
p148
aVbut I won't, because I want to make sure to tell you about one solution.
p149
aVAnd the good news is, it's a solution that isn't particularly expensive,
p150
aVand doesn't require any fancy drug treatments
p151
aVor new technologies.
p152
aVThe solution is called, "The JJ Way."
p153
aa(lp154
VMeet Jennie Joseph.
p155
aVShe's a midwife in the Orlando, Florida area
p156
aVwho has been serving pregnant women for over a decade.
p157
aVIn what she calls her easy-access clinics,
p158
aVJennie and her team provide prenatal care to over 600 women per year.
p159
aVHer clients, most of whom are black, Haitian and Latina,
p160
aVdeliver at the local hospital.
p161
aVBut by providing accessible and respectful prenatal care,
p162
aVJennie has achieved something remarkable:
p163
aValmost all of her clients give birth to healthy, full-term babies.
p164
aa(lp165
VHer method is deceptively simple.
p166
aVJennie says that all of her appointments start at the front desk.
p167
aVEvery member of her team, and every moment a women is at her clinic,
p168
aVis as supportive as possible.
p169
aVNo one is turned away due to lack of funds.
p170
aVThe JJ Way is to make the finances work no matter what the hurdles.
p171
aVNo one is chastised for showing up late to their appointments.
p172
aVNo one is talked down to or belittled.
p173
aVJennie's waiting room feels more like your aunt's living room than a clinic.
p174
aVShe calls this space "a classroom in disguise."
p175
aVWith the plush chairs arranged in a circle,
p176
aVwomen wait for their appointments in one-on-one chats
p177
aVwith a staff educator,
p178
aVor in group prenatal classes.
p179
aa(lp180
VWhen you finally are called back to your appointment,
p181
aVyou are greeted by Alexis or Trina,
p182
aVtwo of Jennie's medical assistants.
p183
aVBoth are young, African-American and moms themselves.
p184
aVTheir approach is casual and friendly.
p185
aVDuring one visit I observed,
p186
aVTrina chatted with a young soon-to-be mom
p187
aVwhile she took her blood pressure.
p188
aVThis Latina mom was having trouble keeping food down due to nausea.
p189
aVAs Trina deflated the blood pressure cuff,
p190
aVshe said, "We'll see about changing your prescription, OK?
p191
aVWe can't have you not eating."
p192
aVThat "we" is actually a really crucial aspect of Jennie's model.
p193
aVShe sees her staff as part of a team that, alongside the woman and her family,
p194
aVhas one goal:
p195
aVget mom to term with a healthy baby.
p196
aa(lp197
VJennie says that Trina and Alexis are actually the center of her care model,
p198
aVand that her role as a provider is just to support their work.
p199
aVTrina spends a lot of her day on her cell phone,
p200
aVtexting with clients about all sorts of things.
p201
aVOne woman texted to ask if a medication she was prescribed at the hospital
p202
aVwas OK to take while pregnant.
p203
aVThe answer was no.
p204
aVAnother woman texted with pictures of an infant born under Jennie's care.
p205
aVLastly, when you finally are called back to see the provider,
p206
aVyou've already taken your own weight in the waiting room,
p207
aVand done your own pee test in the bathroom.
p208
aa(lp209
VThis is a big departure from the traditional medical model,
p210
aVbecause it places responsibility and information
p211
aVback in the woman's hands.
p212
aVSo rather than a medical setting where you might be chastised
p213
aVfor not keeping up with provider recommendations \u2014
p214
aVthe kind of settings often available to low-income women \u2014
p215
aVJennie's model is to be as supportive as possible.
p216
aVAnd that support provides a crucial buffer
p217
aVto the stress of racism and discrimination facing these women every day.
p218
aa(lp219
VBut here's the best thing about Jennie's model:
p220
aVit's been incredibly successful.
p221
aVRemember those statistics I told you,
p222
aVthat black women are more likely to give birth too early,
p223
aVto give birth to low birth weight babies,
p224
aVto even die due to complications of pregnancy and childbirth?
p225
aVWell, The JJ Way has almost entirely eliminated those problems,
p226
aVstarting with what Jennie calls "skinny babies."
p227
aVShe's been able to get almost all her clients to term
p228
aVwith healthy, chunky babies like this one.
p229
aa(lp230
VAudience: Aw!
p231
aa(lp232
VMiriam Zoila Pérez: This is a baby girl
p233
aVborn to a client of Jennie's this past June.
p234
aa(lp235
VA similar demographic of women in Jennie's area
p236
aVwho gave birth at the same hospital her clients did
p237
aVwere three times more likely to give birth
p238
aVto a baby below a healthy weight.
p239
aVJennie is making headway into what has been seen for decades
p240
aVas an almost intractable problem.
p241
aVSome of you might be thinking,
p242
aVall this one-on-one attention that The JJ Way requires
p243
aVmust be too expensive to scale.
p244
aVWell, you'd be wrong.
p245
aVThe visit with the provider is not the center of Jennie's model,
p246
aVand for good reason.
p247
aVThose visits are expensive, and in order to maintain her model,
p248
aVshe's got to see a lot of clients to cover costs.
p249
aVBut Jennie doesn't have to spend a ton of time with each woman,
p250
aVif all of the members of her team can provide the support, information
p251
aVand care that her clients need.
p252
aVThe beauty of Jennie's model is that she actually believes
p253
aVit can be implemented in pretty much any health care setting.
p254
aVIt's a revolution in care just waiting to happen.
p255
aa(lp256
VThese problems I've been sharing with you are big.
p257
aVThey come from long histories of racism, classism,
p258
aVa society based on race and class stratification.
p259
aVThey involve elaborate physiological mechanisms
p260
aVmeant to protect us,
p261
aVthat, when overstimulated, actually make us sick.
p262
aVBut if there's one thing I've learned from my work as a doula,
p263
aVit's that a little bit of unconditional support can go a really long way.
p264
aVHistory has shown that people are incredibly resilient,
p265
aVand while we can't eradicate racism
p266
aVor the stress that results from it overnight,
p267
aVwe might just be able to create environments that provide a buffer
p268
aVto what people of color experience on a daily basis.
p269
aVAnd during pregnancy, that buffer can be an incredible tool
p270
aVtowards shifting the impact of racism
p271
aVfor generations to come.
