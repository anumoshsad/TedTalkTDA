VSome of my most wonderful memories of childhood
p4
aVare of spending time with my grandmother, Mamar,
p5
aVin our four-family home in Brooklyn, New York.
p6
aVHer apartment was an oasis.
p7
aVIt was a place where I could sneak a cup of coffee,
p8
aVwhich was really warm milk  with just a touch of caffeine.
p9
aVShe loved life.
p10
aVAnd although she worked in a factory,
p11
aVshe saved her pennies and she traveled to Europe.
p12
aVAnd I remember poring over those pictures with her
p13
aVand then dancing with her to her favorite music.
p14
aa(lp15
VAnd then, when I was eight and she was 60,
p16
aVsomething changed.
p17
aVShe no longer worked or traveled.
p18
aVShe no longer danced.
p19
aVThere were no more coffee times.
p20
aVMy mother missed work and took her to doctors
p21
aVwho couldn't make a diagnosis.
p22
aVAnd my father, who worked at night,  would spend every afternoon with her,
p23
aVjust to make sure she ate.
p24
aa(lp25
VHer care became all-consuming for our family.
p26
aVAnd by the time a diagnosis was made,
p27
aVshe was in a deep spiral.
p28
aa(lp29
VNow many of you will recognize her symptoms.
p30
aVMy grandmother had depression.
p31
aVA deep, life-altering depression,
p32
aVfrom which she never recovered.
p33
aVAnd back then, so little  was known about depression.
p34
aa(lp35
VBut even today, 50 years later,
p36
aVthere's still so much more to learn.
p37
aVToday, we know that women  are 70 percent more likely
p38
aVto experience depression over their lifetimes
p39
aVcompared with men.
p40
aVAnd even with this high prevalence,
p41
aVwomen are misdiagnosed between  30 and 50 percent of the time.
p42
aa(lp43
VNow we know that women are more likely
p44
aVto experience the symptoms  of fatigue, sleep disturbance,
p45
aVpain and anxiety compared with men.
p46
aVAnd these symptoms are often overlooked
p47
aVas symptoms of depression.
p48
aa(lp49
VAnd it isn't only depression in which  these sex differences occur,
p50
aVbut they occur across so many diseases.
p51
aa(lp52
VSo it's my grandmother's struggles
p53
aVthat have really led me on a lifelong quest.
p54
aVAnd today, I lead a center in which the mission
p55
aVis to discover why these sex differences occur
p56
aVand to use that knowledge
p57
aVto improve the health of women.
p58
aa(lp59
VToday, we know that every cell has a sex.
p60
aVNow, that's a term coined  by the Institute of Medicine.
p61
aVAnd what it means is that  men and women are different
p62
aVdown to the cellular and molecular levels.
p63
aVIt means that we're different  across all of our organs.
p64
aVFrom our brains to our hearts, our lungs, our joints.
p65
aa(lp66
VNow, it was only 20 years ago
p67
aVthat we hardly had any data on women's health
p68
aVbeyond our reproductive functions.
p69
aVBut then in 1993,
p70
aVthe NIH Revitalization Act was signed into law.
p71
aVAnd what this law did was it mandated
p72
aVthat women and minorities  be included in clinical trials
p73
aVthat were funded by the National Institutes of Health.
p74
aVAnd in many ways, the law has worked.
p75
aVWomen are now routinely  included in clinical studies,
p76
aVand we've learned that there are major differences
p77
aVin the ways that women and men
p78
aVexperience disease.
p79
aVBut remarkably,
p80
aVwhat we have learned about these  differences is often overlooked.
p81
aa(lp82
VSo, we have to ask ourselves the question:
p83
aVWhy leave women's health to chance?
p84
aVAnd we're leaving it to chance in two ways.
p85
aVThe first is that there is so much more to learn
p86
aVand we're not making the investment
p87
aVin fully understanding the extent  of these sex differences.
p88
aVAnd the second is that we aren't  taking what we have learned,
p89
aVand routinely applying it in clinical care.
p90
aVWe are just not doing enough.
p91
aa(lp92
VSo, I'm going to share with you three examples
p93
aVof where sex differences have  impacted the health of women,
p94
aVand where we need to do more.
p95
aa(lp96
VLet's start with heart disease.
p97
aVIt's the number one killer of women  in the United States today.
p98
aVThis is the face of heart disease.
p99
aVLinda is a middle-aged woman,
p100
aVwho had a stent placed in one of the arteries
p101
aVgoing to her heart.
p102
aVWhen she had recurring symptoms  she went back to her doctor.
p103
aVHer doctor did the gold standard test:
p104
aVa cardiac catheterization.
p105
aVIt showed no blockages.
p106
aVLinda's symptoms continued.
p107
aVShe had to stop working.
p108
aVAnd that's when she found us.
p109
aVWhen Linda came to us, we did  another cardiac catheterization
p110
aVand this time, we found clues.
p111
aVBut we needed another test
p112
aVto make the diagnosis.
p113
aVSo we did a test called an intracoronary ultrasound,
p114
aVwhere you use soundwaves to look at the artery
p115
aVfrom the inside out.
p116
aa(lp117
VAnd what we found
p118
aVwas that Linda's disease didn't look like
p119
aVthe typical male disease.
p120
aVThe typical male disease looks like this.
p121
aVThere's a discrete blockage or stenosis.
p122
aVLinda's disease, like the disease of so many women,
p123
aVlooks like this.
p124
aVThe plaque is laid down more evenly, more diffusely
p125
aValong the artery, and it's harder to see.
p126
aVSo for Linda, and for so many women,
p127
aVthe gold standard test wasn't gold.
p128
aa(lp129
VNow, Linda received the right treatment.
p130
aVShe went back to her life and, fortunately, today
p131
aVshe is doing well.
p132
aVBut Linda was lucky.
p133
aVShe found us, we found her disease.
p134
aa(lp135
VBut for too many women, that's not the case.
p136
aVWe have the tools.
p137
aVWe have the technology to make the diagnosis.
p138
aVBut it's all too often that these sex diffferences
p139
aVare overlooked.
p140
aa(lp141
VSo what about treatment?
p142
aVA landmark study that was published two years ago
p143
aVasked the very important question:
p144
aVWhat are the most effective treatments  for heart disease in women?
p145
aVThe authors looked at papers  written over a 10-year period,
p146
aVand hundreds had to be thrown out.
p147
aVAnd what they found out was that  of those that were tossed out,
p148
aV65 percent were excluded
p149
aVbecause even though women  were included in the studies,
p150
aVthe analysis didn't differentiate  between women and men.
p151
aVWhat a lost opportunity.
p152
aVThe money had been spent
p153
aVand we didn't learn how women fared.
p154
aVAnd these studies could not contribute one iota
p155
aVto the very, very important question,
p156
aVwhat are the most effective treatments
p157
aVfor heart disease in women?
p158
aa(lp159
VI want to introduce you to  Hortense, my godmother,
p160
aVHung Wei, a relative of a colleague,
p161
aVand somebody you may recognize \u2014
p162
aVDana, Christopher Reeve's wife.
p163
aVAll three women have something  very important in common.
p164
aVAll three were diagnosed with lung cancer,
p165
aVthe number one cancer killer of women
p166
aVin the United States today.
p167
aVAll three were nonsmokers.
p168
aVSadly, Dana and Hung Wei died of their disease.
p169
aVToday, what we know is that women who are nonsmokers are three times more likely
p170
aVto be diagnosed with lung cancer than are men
p171
aVwho are nonsmokers.
p172
aVNow interestingly, when women are  diagnosed with lung cancer,
p173
aVtheir survival tends to be better than that of men.
p174
aVNow, here are some clues.
p175
aVOur investigators have found that there are
p176
aVcertain genes in the lung tumor  cells of both women and men.
p177
aVAnd these genes are activated
p178
aVmainly by estrogen.
p179
aVAnd when these genes are over-expressed,
p180
aVit's associated with improved survival
p181
aVonly in young women.
p182
aVNow this is a very early finding
p183
aVand we don't yet know whether it has relevance
p184
aVto clinical care.
p185
aVBut it's findings like this that may provide hope
p186
aVand may provide an opportunity to save lives
p187
aVof both women and men.
p188
aa(lp189
VNow, let me share with you an example
p190
aVof when we do consider sex differences, it can drive the science.
p191
aVSeveral years ago a new lung cancer drug
p192
aVwas being evaluated,
p193
aVand when the authors looked  at whose tumors shrank,
p194
aVthey found that 82 percent were women.
p195
aVThis led them to ask the question: Well, why?
p196
aVAnd what they found
p197
aVwas that the genetic mutations  that the drug targeted
p198
aVwere far more common in women.
p199
aVAnd what this has led to
p200
aVis a more personalized approach
p201
aVto the treatment of lung cancer  that also includes sex.
p202
aa(lp203
VThis is what we can accomplish
p204
aVwhen we don't leave women's health to chance.
p205
aVWe know that when you invest in research,
p206
aVyou get results.
p207
aVTake a look at the death rate  from breast cancer over time.
p208
aVAnd now take a look at the death rates
p209
aVfrom lung cancer in women over time.
p210
aVNow let's look at the dollars  invested in breast cancer \u2014
p211
aVthese are the dollars invested per death \u2014
p212
aVand the dollars invested in lung cancer.
p213
aVNow, it's clear that our investment in breast cancer
p214
aVhas produced results.
p215
aVThey may not be fast enough,
p216
aVbut it has produced results.
p217
aVWe can do the same
p218
aVfor lung cancer and for every other disease.
p219
aa(lp220
VSo let's go back to depression.
p221
aVDepression is the number one cause
p222
aVof disability in women in the world today.
p223
aVOur investigators have found
p224
aVthat there are differences in the brains
p225
aVof women and men
p226
aVin the areas that are connected with mood.
p227
aVAnd when you put men and women
p228
aVin a functional MRI scanner \u2014
p229
aVthat's the kind of scanner that shows how the brain is functioning when it's activated \u2014
p230
aVso you put them in the scanner  and you expose them to stress.
p231
aVYou can actually see the difference.
p232
aVAnd it's findings like this
p233
aVthat we believe hold some of the clues
p234
aVfor why we see these very significant sex differences
p235
aVin depression.
p236
aa(lp237
VBut even though we know
p238
aVthat these differences occur,
p239
aV66 percent
p240
aVof the brain research that begins in animals
p241
aVis done in either male animals
p242
aVor animals in whom the sex is not identified.
p243
aa(lp244
VSo, I think we have to ask again the question:
p245
aVWhy leave women's health to chance?
p246
aVAnd this is a question that haunts those of us
p247
aVin science and medicine
p248
aVwho believe that we are on the verge  of being able to dramatically improve
p249
aVthe health of women.
p250
aVWe know that every cell has a sex.
p251
aVWe know that these differences  are often overlooked.
p252
aVAnd therefore we know that women  are not getting the full benefit
p253
aVof modern science and medicine today.
p254
aVWe have the tools
p255
aVbut we lack the collective will and momentum.
p256
aa(lp257
VWomen's health is an equal rights issue
p258
aVas important as equal pay.
p259
aVAnd it's an issue of the quality
p260
aVand the integrity of science and medicine.
p261
aV(Applause)
p262
aVSo imagine the momentum we could achieve
p263
aVin advancing the health of women
p264
aVif we considered whether these  sex differences were present
p265
aVat the very beginning of designing research.
p266
aVOr if we analyzed our data by sex.
p267
aa(lp268
VSo, people often ask me:
p269
aVWhat can I do?
p270
aVAnd here's what I suggest:
p271
aVFirst, I suggest that you think about women's health
p272
aVin the same way
p273
aVthat you think and care about other  causes that are important to you.
p274
aVAnd second, and equally as important,
p275
aVthat as a woman,
p276
aVyou have to ask your doctor
p277
aVand the doctors who are caring  for those who you love:
p278
aVIs this disease or treatment different in women?
p279
aVNow, this is a profound question  because the answer is likely yes,
p280
aVbut your doctor may not know  the answer, at least not yet.
p281
aVBut if you ask the question,  your doctor will very likely
p282
aVgo looking for the answer.
p283
aVAnd this is so important,
p284
aVnot only for ourselves,
p285
aVbut for all of those whom we love.
p286
aVWhether it be a mother, a daughter, a sister,
p287
aVa friend or a grandmother.
p288
aa(lp289
VIt was my grandmother's suffering
p290
aVthat inspired my work
p291
aVto improve the health of women.
p292
aVThat's her legacy.
p293
aVOur legacy can be to improve the health of women
p294
aVfor this generation
p295
aVand for generations to come.
p296
aa(lp297
VThank you.
