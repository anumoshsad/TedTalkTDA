VI grew up in Bihar, India's poorest state,
p4
aVand I remember when I was six years old,
p5
aVI remember coming home one day to find a cart
p6
aVfull of the most delicious sweets at our doorstep.
p7
aVMy brothers and I dug in,
p8
aVand that's when my father came home.
p9
aVHe was livid, and I still remember how we cried
p10
aVwhen that cart with our half-eaten sweets
p11
aVwas pulled away from us.
p12
aa(lp13
VLater, I understood why my father got so upset.
p14
aVThose sweets were a bribe
p15
aVfrom a contractor who was trying to get my father
p16
aVto award him a government contract.
p17
aVMy father was responsible for building roads in Bihar,
p18
aVand he had developed a firm stance against corruption,
p19
aVeven though he was harassed and threatened.
p20
aVHis was a lonely struggle, because Bihar
p21
aVwas also India's most corrupt state,
p22
aVwhere public officials were enriching themselves,
p23
aV[rather] than serving the poor who had no means
p24
aVto express their anguish if their children
p25
aVhad no food or no schooling.
p26
aa(lp27
VAnd I experienced this most viscerally
p28
aVwhen I traveled to remote villages to study poverty.
p29
aVAnd as I went village to village,
p30
aVI remember one day, when I was famished and exhausted,
p31
aVand I was almost collapsing
p32
aVin a scorching heat under a tree,
p33
aVand just at that time, one of the poorest men in that village
p34
aVinvited me into his hut and graciously fed me.
p35
aVOnly I later realized that what he fed me
p36
aVwas food for his entire family for two days.
p37
aVThis profound gift of generosity
p38
aVchallenged and changed the very purpose of my life.
p39
aVI resolved to give back.
p40
aa(lp41
VLater, I joined the World Bank, which sought to fight
p42
aVsuch poverty by transferring aid from rich to poor countries.
p43
aVMy initial work focused on Uganda, where I focused
p44
aVon negotiating reforms with the Finance Ministry of Uganda
p45
aVso they could access our loans.
p46
aVBut after we disbursed the loans, I remember
p47
aVa trip in Uganda where I found newly built schools
p48
aVwithout textbooks or teachers,
p49
aVnew health clinics without drugs,
p50
aVand the poor once again without any voice or recourse.
p51
aVIt was Bihar all over again.
p52
aa(lp53
VBihar represents the challenge of development:
p54
aVabject poverty surrounded by corruption.
p55
aVGlobally, 1.3 billion people live on less than
p56
aV$1.25 a day, and the work I did in Uganda
p57
aVrepresents the traditional approach to these problems
p58
aVthat has been practiced since 1944,
p59
aVwhen winners of World War II, 500 founding fathers,
p60
aVand one lonely founding mother,
p61
aVgathered in New Hampshire, USA,
p62
aVto establish the Bretton Woods institutions,
p63
aVincluding the World Bank.
p64
aVAnd that traditional approach to development
p65
aVhad three key elements. First, transfer of resources
p66
aVfrom rich countries in the North
p67
aVto poorer countries in the South,
p68
aVaccompanied by reform prescriptions.
p69
aVSecond, the development institutions that channeled
p70
aVthese transfers were opaque, with little transparency
p71
aVof what they financed or what results they achieved.
p72
aVAnd third, the engagement in developing countries
p73
aVwas with a narrow set of government elites
p74
aVwith little interaction with the citizens, who are
p75
aVthe ultimate beneficiaries of development assistance.
p76
aa(lp77
VToday, each of these elements is opening up
p78
aVdue to dramatic changes in the global environment.
p79
aVOpen knowledge, open aid, open governance,
p80
aVand together, they represent three key shifts
p81
aVthat are transforming development
p82
aVand that also hold greater hope for the problems
p83
aVI witnessed in Uganda and in Bihar.
p84
aa(lp85
VThe first key shift is open knowledge.
p86
aVYou know, developing countries today will not simply
p87
aVaccept solutions that are handed down to them
p88
aVby the U.S., Europe or the World Bank.
p89
aVThey get their inspiration, their hope,
p90
aVtheir practical know-how,
p91
aVfrom successful emerging economies in the South.
p92
aVThey want to know how China lifted 500 million people
p93
aVout of poverty in 30 years,
p94
aVhow Mexico's Oportunidades program
p95
aVimproved schooling and nutrition for millions of children.
p96
aVThis is the new ecosystem of open-knowledge flows,
p97
aVnot just traveling North to South, but South to South,
p98
aVand even South to North,
p99
aVwith Mexico's Oportunidades today inspiring New York City.
p100
aa(lp101
VAnd just as these North-to-South transfers are opening up,
p102
aVso too are the development institutions
p103
aVthat channeled these transfers.
p104
aVThis is the second shift: open aid.
p105
aVRecently, the World Bank opened its vault of data
p106
aVfor public use, releasing 8,000 economic and social indicators
p107
aVfor 200 countries over 50 years,
p108
aVand it launched a global competition to crowdsource
p109
aVinnovative apps using this data.
p110
aVDevelopment institutions today are also opening
p111
aVfor public scrutiny the projects they finance.
p112
aVTake GeoMapping. In this map from Kenya,
p113
aVthe red dots show where all the schools financed by donors
p114
aVare located, and the darker the shade of green,
p115
aVthe more the number of out-of-school children.
p116
aVSo this simple mashup reveals that donors
p117
aVhave not financed any schools in the areas
p118
aVwith the most out-of-school children,
p119
aVprovoking new questions. Is development assistance
p120
aVtargeting those who most need our help?
p121
aVIn this manner, the World Bank has now GeoMapped
p122
aV30,000 project activities in 143 countries,
p123
aVand donors are using a common platform
p124
aVto map all their projects.
p125
aVThis is a tremendous leap forward in transparency
p126
aVand accountability of aid.
p127
aa(lp128
VAnd this leads me to the third, and in my view,
p129
aVthe most significant shift in development:
p130
aVopen governance. Governments today are opening up
p131
aVjust as citizens are demanding voice and accountability.
p132
aVFrom the Arab Spring to the Anna Hazare movement in India,
p133
aVusing mobile phones and social media
p134
aVnot just for political accountability
p135
aVbut also for development accountability.
p136
aVAre governments delivering services to the citizens?
p137
aVSo for instance, several governments in Africa
p138
aVand Eastern Europe are opening their budgets to the public.
p139
aa(lp140
VBut, you know, there is a big difference between a budget
p141
aVthat's public and a budget that's accessible.
p142
aVThis is a public budget. (Laughter)
p143
aVAnd as you can see, it's not really accessible
p144
aVor understandable to an ordinary citizen
p145
aVthat is trying to understand how the government is spending its resources.
p146
aVTo tackle this problem, governments are using new tools
p147
aVto visualize the budget so it's more understandable
p148
aVto the public.
p149
aVIn this map from Moldova, the green color shows
p150
aVthose districts that have low spending on schools
p151
aVbut good educational outcomes,
p152
aVand the red color shows the opposite.
p153
aVTools like this help turn a shelf full of inscrutable documents
p154
aVinto a publicly understandable visual,
p155
aVand what's exciting is that with this openness,
p156
aVthere are today new opportunities for citizens
p157
aVto give feedback and engage with government.
p158
aVSo in the Philippines today, parents and students
p159
aVcan give real-time feedback on a website,
p160
aVCheckmyschool.org, or using SMS, whether teachers
p161
aVand textbooks are showing up in school,
p162
aVthe same problems I witnessed in Uganda and in Bihar.
p163
aVAnd the government is responsive. So for instance,
p164
aVwhen it was reported on this website that 800 students
p165
aVwere at risk because school repairs had stalled
p166
aVdue to corruption, the Department of Education
p167
aVin the Philippines took swift action.
p168
aa(lp169
VAnd you know what's exciting is that this innovation
p170
aVis now spreading South to South, from the Philippines
p171
aVto Indonesia, Kenya, Moldova and beyond.
p172
aVIn Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, even an impoverished
p173
aVcommunity was able to use these tools
p174
aVto voice its aspirations.
p175
aVThis is what the map of Tandale looked like
p176
aVin August, 2011. But within a few weeks,
p177
aVuniversity students were able to use mobile phones
p178
aVand an open-source platform to dramatically map
p179
aVthe entire community infrastructure.
p180
aVAnd what is very exciting is that citizens were then
p181
aVable to give feedback as to which health or water points
p182
aVwere not working, aggregated
p183
aVin the red bubbles that you see,
p184
aVwhich together provides a graphic visual
p185
aVof the collective voices of the poor.
p186
aVToday, even Bihar is turning around and opening up
p187
aVunder a committed leadership that is making government
p188
aVtransparent, accessible and responsive to the poor.
p189
aa(lp190
VBut, you know, in many parts of the world,
p191
aVgovernments are not interested in opening up
p192
aVor in serving the poor, and it is a real challenge
p193
aVfor those who want to change the system.
p194
aVThese are the lonely warriors
p195
aVlike my father and many, many others,
p196
aVand a key frontier of development work
p197
aVis to help these lonely warriors join hands
p198
aVso they can together overcome the odds.
p199
aVSo for instance, today, in Ghana, courageous reformers
p200
aVfrom civil society, Parliament and government,
p201
aVhave forged a coalition for transparent contracts
p202
aVin the oil sector, and, galvanized by this,
p203
aVreformers in Parliament are now investigating dubious contracts.
p204
aVThese examples give new hope, new possibility
p205
aVto the problems I witnessed in Uganda
p206
aVor that my father confronted in Bihar.
p207
aa(lp208
VTwo years ago, on April 8th, 2010, I called my father.
p209
aVIt was very late at night, and at age 80,
p210
aVhe was typing a 70-page public interest litigation
p211
aVagainst corruption in a road project.
p212
aVThough he was no lawyer, he argued the case in court
p213
aVhimself the next day. He won the ruling,
p214
aVbut later that very evening,
p215
aVhe fell, and he died.
p216
aVHe fought till the end, increasingly passionate
p217
aVthat to combat corruption and poverty,
p218
aVnot only did government officials need to be honest,
p219
aVbut citizens needed to join together
p220
aVto make their voices heard.
p221
aVThese became the two bookends of his life,
p222
aVand the journey he traveled in between
p223
aVmirrored the changing development landscape.
p224
aa(lp225
VToday, I'm inspired by these changes, and I'm excited
p226
aVthat at the World Bank, we are embracing
p227
aVthese new directions, a significant departure
p228
aVfrom my work in Uganda 20 years ago.
p229
aVWe need to radically open up development
p230
aVso knowledge flows in multiple directions,
p231
aVinspiring practitioners, so aid becomes transparent,
p232
aVaccountable and effective, so governments open up
p233
aVand citizens are engaged and empowered
p234
aVwith reformers in government.
p235
aVWe need to accelerate these shifts.
p236
aVIf we do, we will find that the collective voices
p237
aVof the poor will be heard in Bihar,
p238
aVin Uganda, and beyond.
p239
aVWe will find that textbooks and teachers
p240
aVwill show up in schools for their children.
p241
aVWe will find that these children, too,
p242
aVhave a real chance of breaking their way out of poverty.
p243
aVThank you. (Applause)
