VJose Antonio Abreu: My dear friends, ladies and gentlemen,
p9
aVI am overjoyed today
p10
aVat being awarded the TED Prize
p11
aVon behalf of all
p12
aVthe distinguished music teachers,
p13
aVartists and educators from Venezuela
p14
aVwho have selflessly and loyally accompanied me for 35 years
p15
aVin founding, growing and developing in Venezuela
p16
aVthe National System of Youth and Children's Orchestras and Choirs.
p17
aa(lp18
VSince I was a boy,
p19
aVin my early childhood,
p20
aVI always wanted to be a musician,
p21
aVand, thank God, I made it.
p22
aVFrom my teachers, my family and my community,
p23
aVI had all the necessary support to become a musician.
p24
aVAll my life I've dreamed
p25
aVthat all Venezuelan children
p26
aVhave the same opportunity that I had.
p27
aVFrom that desire and from my heart
p28
aVstemmed the idea to make music
p29
aVa deep and global reality for my country.
p30
aa(lp31
VFrom the very first rehearsal, I saw the bright future ahead.
p32
aVBecause the rehearsal meant a great challenge to me.
p33
aVI had received a donation of 50 music stands
p34
aVto be used by 100 boys in that rehearsal.
p35
aVWhen I arrived at the rehearsal, only 11 kids had shown up,
p36
aVand I said to myself,
p37
aV"Do I close the program or multiply these kids?"
p38
aVI decided to face the challenge, and on that same night,
p39
aVI promised those 11 children I'd turn our orchestra
p40
aVinto one of the leading orchestras in the world.
p41
aVTwo months ago, I remembered that promise I made,
p42
aVwhen a distinguished English critic
p43
aVpublished an article in the London Times,
p44
aVasking who could be the winner of the Orchestra World Cup.
p45
aVHe mentioned four great world orchestras,
p46
aVand the fifth one was Venezuela's Youth Symphony Orchestra.
p47
aVToday we can say
p48
aVthat art in Latin America
p49
aVis no longer a monopoly of elites
p50
aVand that it has become a social right,
p51
aVa right for all the people.
p52
aa(lp53
VChild: There is no difference here between classes,
p54
aVnor white or black, nor if you have money or not.
p55
aVSimply, if you are talented,
p56
aVif you have the vocation and the will to be here,
p57
aVyou get in. You share with us and make music.
p58
aa(lp59
VJA: During the recent tour
p60
aVby the Simon Bolivar Youth Orchestra of Venezuela
p61
aVof U.S. and Europe,
p62
aVwe saw how our music moved young audiences
p63
aVto the bottom of their souls,
p64
aVhow children and adolescents rushed up to the stage
p65
aVto receive the jackets from our musicians,
p66
aVhow the standing ovations, sometimes 30 minutes long,
p67
aVseemed to last forever,
p68
aVand how the public, after the concert was over,
p69
aVwent out into the street to greet our young people in triumph.
p70
aVThis meant not only an artistic triumph,
p71
aVbut also a profound emotional sympathy
p72
aVbetween the public of the most advanced nations of the world
p73
aVand the musical youth of Latin America,
p74
aVas seen in Venezuela,
p75
aVgiving these audiences a message of music, vitality, energy,
p76
aVenthusiasm and strength.
p77
aa(lp78
VIn its essence, the orchestra and the choir
p79
aVare much more than artistic structures.
p80
aVThey are examples and schools of social life,
p81
aVbecause to sing and to play together
p82
aVmeans to intimately coexist
p83
aVtoward perfection and excellence,
p84
aVfollowing a strict discipline of organization and coordination
p85
aVin order to seek the harmonic interdependence
p86
aVof voices and instruments.
p87
aVThat's how they build a spirit of solidarity
p88
aVand fraternity among them,
p89
aVdevelop their self-esteem
p90
aVand foster the ethical and aesthetical values
p91
aVrelated to the music in all its senses.
p92
aVThis is why music is immensely important
p93
aVin the awakening of sensibility, in the forging of values
p94
aVand in the training of youngsters
p95
aVto teach other kids.
p96
aa(lp97
VChild: After all this time here,
p98
aVmusic is life.
p99
aVNothing else.
p100
aVMusic is life.
p101
aa(lp102
VJA: Each teenager and child in El Sistema has his own story,
p103
aVand they are all important and of great significance to me.
p104
aVLet me mention the case of Edicson Ruiz.
p105
aVHe is a boy from a parish in Caracas
p106
aVwho passionately attended to his double bass lessons
p107
aVat the San Agustin's Junior Orchestra.
p108
aVWith his effort,
p109
aVand the support of his mother, his family and his community,
p110
aVhe became a principal member
p111
aVin the double bass segment of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra.
p112
aVWe have another well-known case \u2014 Gustavo Dudamel.
p113
aVHe started as a boy member of the children's orchestra
p114
aVin his hometown, Barquisimeto.
p115
aVThere, he grew as a violinist and as a conductor.
p116
aVHe became the conductor of Venezuela's junior orchestras,
p117
aVand today conducts the world's greatest orchestras.
p118
aVHe is the musical director of Los Angeles Philharmonic,
p119
aVand is still the overall leader of Venezuela's junior orchestras.
p120
aVHe was the conductor of the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra,
p121
aVand he's an unbeatable example
p122
aVfor young musicians in Latin America and the world.
p123
aa(lp124
VThe structure of El Sistema
p125
aVis based on a new and flexible managing style
p126
aVadapted to the features of each community and region,
p127
aVand today attends to 300,000 children of the lower and middle class
p128
aVall over Venezuela.
p129
aVIt's a program of social rescue
p130
aVand deep cultural transformation
p131
aVdesigned for the whole Venezuelan society
p132
aVwith absolutely no distinctions whatsoever,
p133
aVbut emphasizing the vulnerable and endangered social groups.
p134
aa(lp135
VThe effect of El Sistema is felt in three fundamental circles:
p136
aVin the personal/social circle,
p137
aVin the family circle and in the community.
p138
aVIn the personal/social circle,
p139
aVthe children in the orchestras and choirs
p140
aVdevelop their intellectual and emotional side.
p141
aVThe music becomes a source
p142
aVfor developing the dimensions of the human being,
p143
aVthus elevating the spirit
p144
aVand leading man to a full development of his personality.
p145
aVSo, the emotional and intellectual profits are huge \u2014
p146
aVthe acquisition of leadership, teaching and training principles,
p147
aVthe sense of commitment, responsibility,
p148
aVgenerosity and dedication to others,
p149
aVand the individual contribution to achieve great collective goals.
p150
aVAll this leads to the development of self-esteem and confidence.
p151
aa(lp152
VMother Teresa of Calcutta
p153
aVinsisted on something that always impressed me:
p154
aVthe most miserable and tragic thing about poverty
p155
aVis not the lack of bread or roof,
p156
aVbut the feeling of being no-one \u2014
p157
aVthe feeling of not being anyone,
p158
aVthe lack of identification,
p159
aVthe lack of public esteem.
p160
aVThat's why the child's development
p161
aVin the orchestra and the choir
p162
aVprovides him with a noble identity
p163
aVand makes him a role model for his family and community.
p164
aVIt makes him a better student at school
p165
aVbecause it inspires in him a sense of responsibility,
p166
aVperseverance and punctuality that will greatly help him at school.
p167
aa(lp168
VWithin the family, the parents' support is unconditional.
p169
aVThe child becomes a role model for both his parents,
p170
aVand this is very important for a poor child.
p171
aVOnce the child discovers he is important to his family,
p172
aVhe begins to seek new ways of improving himself
p173
aVand hopes better for himself and his community.
p174
aVAlso, he hopes for social and economic improvements for his own family.
p175
aVAll this makes up a constructive and ascending social dynamic.
p176
aVThe large majority of our children belong, as I already mentioned,
p177
aVto the most vulnerable strata of the Venezuelan population.
p178
aVThat encourages them to embrace new dreams, new goals,
p179
aVand progress in the various opportunities
p180
aVthat music has to offer.
p181
aa(lp182
VFinally, in the circle of the community,
p183
aVthe orchestras prove to be the creative spaces of culture
p184
aVand sources of exchange and new meanings.
p185
aVThe spontaneity music has
p186
aVexcludes it as a luxury item and makes it a patrimony of society.
p187
aVIt's what makes a child play a violin at home,
p188
aVwhile his father works in his carpentry.
p189
aVIt's what makes a little girl play the clarinet at home,
p190
aVwhile her mother does the housework.
p191
aVThe idea is that the families join with pride and joy
p192
aVin the activities of the orchestras and the choirs
p193
aVthat their children belong to.
p194
aVThe huge spiritual world that music produces in itself,
p195
aVwhich also lies within itself,
p196
aVends up overcoming material poverty.
p197
aVFrom the minute a child's taught how to play an instrument,
p198
aVhe's no longer poor.
p199
aVHe becomes a child in progress heading for a professional level,
p200
aVwho'll later become a full citizen.
p201
aVNeedless to say that music is the number one prevention
p202
aVagainst prostitution, violence, bad habits,
p203
aVand everything degrading in the life of a child.
p204
aa(lp205
VA few years ago, historian Arnold Toynbee
p206
aVsaid that the world was suffering a huge spiritual crisis.
p207
aVNot an economic or social crisis, but a spiritual one.
p208
aVI believe that to confront such a crisis,
p209
aVonly art and religion can give proper answers to humanity,
p210
aVto mankind's deepest aspirations,
p211
aVand to the historic demands of our times.
p212
aVEducation \u2014 the synthesis of wisdom and knowledge \u2014
p213
aVis the means to strive for a more perfect, more aware,
p214
aVmore noble and more just society.
p215
aa(lp216
VWith passion and enthusiasm we pay profound respects to TED
p217
aVfor its outstanding humanism, the scope of its principles,
p218
aVfor its open and generous promotion of young values.
p219
aVWe hope that TED can contribute in a full and fundamental way
p220
aVto the building of this new era in the teaching of music,
p221
aVin which the social, communal, spiritual and vindicatory aims
p222
aVof the child and the adolescent
p223
aVbecome a beacon and a goal for a vast social mission.
p224
aVNo longer putting society at the service of art,
p225
aVand much less at the services of monopolies of the elite,
p226
aVbut instead art at the service of society,
p227
aVat the service of the weakest, at the service of the children,
p228
aVat the service of the sick, at the service of the vulnerable,
p229
aVand at the service of all those who cry for vindication
p230
aVthrough the spirit of their human condition
p231
aVand the raising up of their dignity.
