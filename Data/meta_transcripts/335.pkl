VMy mission in life since I was a kid was,
p4
aVand is, to take the rest of you into space.
p5
aVIt's during our lifetime that we're going to take the Earth,
p6
aVtake the people of Earth and transition off, permanently. And that's exciting.
p7
aVIn fact, I think it is a moral imperative
p8
aVthat we open the space frontier.
p9
aVYou know, it's the first time that we're going to have a chance
p10
aVto have planetary redundancy,
p11
aVa chance to, if you would, back up the biosphere.
p12
aVAnd if you think about space,
p13
aVeverything we hold of value on this planet \u2014
p14
aVmetals and minerals and real estate and energy \u2014 is in infinite quantities in space.
p15
aa(lp16
VIn fact, the Earth is a crumb in a supermarket filled with resources.
p17
aVThe analogy for me is Alaska. You know, we bought Alaska.
p18
aVWe Americans bought Alaska in the 1850s. It's called Seward's folly.
p19
aVWe valued it as the number of seal pelts we could kill.
p20
aVAnd then we discovered these things \u2014 gold and oil and fishing and timber \u2014
p21
aVand it became, you know, a trillion-dollar economy,
p22
aVand now we take our honeymoons there. The same thing will happen in space.
p23
aVWe are on the verge of the greatest exploration
p24
aVthat the human race has ever known.
p25
aa(lp26
VWe explore for three reasons,
p27
aVthe weakest of which is curiosity.
p28
aVYou know, it's funded NASA's budget up until now.
p29
aVSome images from Mars, 1997.
p30
aVIn fact, I think in the next decade, without any question,
p31
aVwe will discover life on Mars and find that it is literally ubiquitous
p32
aVunder the soils and different parts of that planet.
p33
aa(lp34
VThe stronger motivator, the much stronger motivator, is fear.
p35
aVIt drove us to the moon. We \u2014 literally in fear \u2014 with the Soviet Union
p36
aVraced to the moon. And we have these huge rocks,
p37
aVyou know, killer-sized rocks in the hundreds of thousands or millions out there,
p38
aVand while the probability is very small,
p39
aVthe impact, figured in literally,
p40
aVof one of these hitting the Earth is so huge
p41
aVthat to spend a small fraction looking, searching,
p42
aVpreparing to defend, is not unreasonable.
p43
aa(lp44
VAnd of course, the third motivator,
p45
aVone near and dear to my heart as an entrepreneur, is wealth.
p46
aVIn fact, the greatest wealth. If you think about these other asteroids,
p47
aVthere's a class of the nickel iron,
p48
aVwhich in platinum-group metal markets alone
p49
aVare worth something like 20 trillion dollars,
p50
aVif you can go out and grab one of these rocks.
p51
aVMy plan is to actually buy puts on the precious metal market,
p52
aVand then actually claim that I'm going to go out and get one.
p53
aVAnd that will fund the actual mission to go and get one.
p54
aVBut fear, curiosity and greed have driven us.
p55
aVAnd for me, this is \u2014 I'm the short kid on the right.
p56
aVThis was \u2014 my motivation was actually during Apollo.
p57
aa(lp58
VAnd Apollo was one of the greatest motivators ever.
p59
aVIf you think about what happened at the turn of \u2014 early 1960s,
p60
aVon May 25, JFK said, "We're going to go to the moon."
p61
aVAnd people left their jobs and they went to obscure locations
p62
aVto go and be part of this amazing mission.
p63
aVAnd we knew nothing about going to space.
p64
aVWe went from having literally put Alan Shepard in suborbital flight
p65
aVto going to the moon in eight years,
p66
aVand the average age of the people that got us there was 26 years old.
p67
aVThey didn't know what couldn't be done.
p68
aVThey had to make up everything.
p69
aVAnd that, my friend, is amazing motivation.
p70
aVThis is Gene Cernan, a good friend of mine, saying,
p71
aV"If I can go to the moon" \u2014 this is the last human on the moon so far \u2014
p72
aV"nothing, nothing is impossible." But of course,
p73
aVwe've thought about the government always as the person taking us there.
p74
aa(lp75
VBut I put forward here, the government is not going to get us there.
p76
aVThe government is unable to take the risks required to open up this precious frontier.
p77
aVThe shuttle is costing a billion dollars a launch.
p78
aVThat's a pathetic number. It's unreasonable.
p79
aVWe shouldn't be happy in standing for that.
p80
aVOne of the things that we did with the Ansari X PRIZE
p81
aVwas take the challenge on that risk is OK, you know.
p82
aVAs we are going out there and taking on a new frontier,
p83
aVwe should be allowed to risk.
p84
aVIn fact, anyone who says we shouldn't, you know,
p85
aVjust needs to be put aside, because, as we go forward,
p86
aVin fact, the greatest discoveries we will ever know is ahead of us.
p87
aVThe entrepreneurs in the space business are the furry mammals,
p88
aVand clearly the industrial-military complex \u2014
p89
aVwith Boeing and Lockheed and NASA \u2014 are the dinosaurs.
p90
aVThe ability for us to access these resources
p91
aVto gain planetary redundancy \u2014
p92
aVwe can now gather all the information, the genetic codes,
p93
aVyou know, everything stored on our databases,
p94
aVand back them up off the planet,
p95
aVin case there would be one of those disastrous situations.
p96
aa(lp97
VThe difficulty is getting there, and clearly, the cost to orbit is key.
p98
aVOnce you're in orbit, you are two thirds of the way, energetically, to anywhere \u2014
p99
aVthe moon, to Mars. And today,
p100
aVthere's only three vehicles \u2014 the U.S. shuttle, the Russian Soyuz
p101
aVand the Chinese vehicle \u2014 that gets you there.
p102
aVArguably, it's about 100 million dollars a person on the space shuttle.
p103
aVOne of the companies I started, Space Adventures, will sell you a ticket.
p104
aVWe've done two so far. We'll be announcing two more on the Soyuz
p105
aVto go up to the space station for 20 million dollars.
p106
aVBut that's expensive and to understand what the potential is \u2014
p107
aa(lp108
V(Laughter) \u2014
p109
aa(lp110
Vit is expensive. But people are willing to pay that!
p111
aVYou know, one \u2014 we have a very unique period in time today.
p112
aVFor the first time ever, we have enough wealth
p113
aVconcentrated in the hands of few individuals
p114
aVand the technology accessible
p115
aVthat will allow us to really drive space exploration.
p116
aVBut how cheap could it get? I want to give you the end point.
p117
aVWe know \u2014 20 million dollars today, you can go and buy a ticket,
p118
aVbut how cheap could it get?
p119
aa(lp120
VLet's go back to high school physics here.
p121
aVIf you calculate the amount of potential energy, mgh,
p122
aVto take you and your spacesuit up to a couple hundred miles,
p123
aVand then you accelerate yourself to 17,500 miles per hour \u2014
p124
aVremember, that one half MV squared \u2014 and you figure it out.
p125
aVIt's about 5.7 gigajoules of energy.
p126
aVIf you expended that over an hour, it's about 1.6 megawatts.
p127
aVIf you go to one of Vijay's micro-power sources,
p128
aVand they sell it to you for seven cents a kilowatt hour \u2014
p129
aVanybody here fast in math?
p130
aVHow much will it cost you and your spacesuit to go to orbit?
p131
aV100 bucks. That's the price-improvement curve that \u2014
p132
aVwe need some breakthroughs in physics along the way,
p133
aVI'll grant you that.
p134
aa(lp135
V(Laughter)
p136
aa(lp137
VBut guys, if history has taught us anything,
p138
aVit's that if you can imagine it, you will get there eventually.
p139
aVI have no question that the physics,
p140
aVthe engineering to get us down to the point
p141
aVwhere all of us can afford orbital space flight is around the corner.
p142
aVThe difficulty is that there needs to be a real marketplace to drive the investment.
p143
aVToday, the Boeings and the Lockheeds don't spend a dollar
p144
aVof their own money in R&D.
p145
aVIt's all government research dollars, and very few of those.
p146
aVAnd in fact, the large corporations,
p147
aVthe governments, can't take the risk.
p148
aVSo we need what I call an exothermic economic reaction in space.
p149
aVToday's commercial markets worldwide, global commercial launch market?
p150
aV12 to 15 launches per year.
p151
aVNumber of commercial companies out there? 12 to 15 companies.
p152
aVOne per company. That's not it. There's only one marketplace,
p153
aVand I call them self-loading carbon payloads.
p154
aVThey come with their own money. They're easy to make.
p155
aVIt's people. The Ansari X PRIZE was my solution,
p156
aVreading about Lindbergh for creating the vehicles to get us there.
p157
aa(lp158
VWe offered 10 million dollars in cash for the first reusable ship,
p159
aVcarry three people up to 100 kilometers,
p160
aVcome back down, and within two weeks, make the trip again.
p161
aVTwenty-six teams from seven countries entered the competition,
p162
aVspending between one to 25 million dollars each.
p163
aVAnd of course, we had beautiful SpaceShipOne,
p164
aVwhich made those two flights and won the competition.
p165
aVAnd I'd like to take you there, to that morning,
p166
aVfor just a quick video.
p167
aa(lp168
V(Video) Pilot: Release our fire.
p169
aa(lp170
VRichard Searfoss: Good luck.
p171
aa(lp172
V(Applause)
p173
aa(lp174
VRS: We've got an altitude call of 368,000 feet.
p175
aa(lp176
V(Applause)
p177
aa(lp178
VRS: So in my official capacity as the chief judge
p179
aVof the Ansari X PRIZE competition,
p180
aVI declare that Mojave Aerospace Ventures
p181
aVhas indeed earned the Ansari X PRIZE.
p182
aa(lp183
V(Applause)
p184
aa(lp185
VPeter Diamandis: Probably the most difficult thing that I had to do
p186
aVwas raise the capital for this. It was literally impossible.
p187
aVWe went \u2014 I went to 100, 200 CEOs, CMOs.
p188
aVNo one believed it was done. Everyone said, "Oh, what does NASA think?
p189
aVWell, people are going to die,
p190
aVhow can you possibly going to put this forward?"
p191
aVI found a visionary family, the Ansari family, and Champ Car,
p192
aVand raised part of the money, but not the full 10 million.
p193
aa(lp194
VAnd what I ended up doing was going out to the insurance industry
p195
aVand buying a hole-in-one insurance policy.
p196
aVSee, the insurance companies went to Boeing and Lockheed,
p197
aVand said, "Are you going to compete?" No.
p198
aV"Are you going to compete?" No. "No one's going to win this thing."
p199
aVSo, they took a bet that no one would win by January of '05,
p200
aVand I took a bet that someone would win.
p201
aa(lp202
V(Applause)
p203
aa(lp204
VSo \u2014 and the best thing is they paid off and the check didn't bounce.
p205
aa(lp206
V(Laughter)
p207
aa(lp208
VWe've had a lot of accomplishments
p209
aVand it's been a tremendous success.
p210
aVOne of the things I'm most happy about is that the SpaceShipOne
p211
aVis going to hang in Air and Space Museum,
p212
aVnext to the Spirit of St. Louis and the Wright Flyer.
p213
aVIsn't that great? (Applause)
p214
aVSo a little bit about the future, steps to space, what's available for you.
p215
aVToday, you can go and experience weightless flights.
p216
aVBy '08, suborbital flights, the price tag for that, you know, on Virgin,
p217
aVis going to be about 200,000.
p218
aVThere are three or four other serious efforts that will bring the price down very rapidly,
p219
aVI think, to about 25,000 dollars for a suborbital flight.
p220
aVOrbital flights \u2014 we can take you to the space station.
p221
aa(lp222
VAnd then I truly believe, once a group is in orbit around the Earth \u2014
p223
aVI know if they don't do it, I am \u2014
p224
aVwe're going to stockpile some fuel,
p225
aVmake a beeline for the moon and grab some real estate.
p226
aa(lp227
V(Laughter)
p228
aa(lp229
VQuick moment for the designers in the audience.
p230
aVWe spent 11 years getting FAA approval to do zero gravity flights.
p231
aVHere are some fun images. Here's Burt Rutan
p232
aVand my good friend Greg Meronek inside a zero gravity \u2014
p233
aVpeople think a zero gravity room,
p234
aVthere's a switch on there that turns it off \u2014
p235
aVbut it's actually parabolic flight of an airplane.
p236
aVAnd turns out 7-Up has just done a little commercial that's airing this month.
p237
aVIf we can get the audio up?
p238
aa(lp239
V(Video) Narrator: For a chance to win the first free ticket to space,
p240
aVlook for specially marked packages of Diet 7-Up.
p241
aVWhen you want the taste that won't weigh you down,
p242
aVthe only way to go is up.
p243
aa(lp244
VPD: That was filmed inside our airplane, and so, you can now do this.
p245
aVWe're based down in Florida.
p246
aVLet me talk about the other thing I'm excited about.
p247
aVThe future of prizes. You know, prizes are a very old idea.
p248
aVI had the pleasure of borrowing from the Longitude Prize
p249
aVand the Orteig Prize that put Lindbergh forward.
p250
aVAnd we have made a decision in the X PRIZE Foundation
p251
aVto actually carry that concept forward into other technology areas,
p252
aVand we just took on a new mission statement:
p253
aV"to bring about radical breakthroughs in space
p254
aVand other technologies for the benefit of humanity."
p255
aVAnd this is something that we're very excited about.
p256
aVI showed this slide to Larry Page, who just joined our board.
p257
aa(lp258
VAnd you know, when you give to a nonprofit,
p259
aVyou might have 50 cents on the dollar.
p260
aVIf you have a matching grant, it's typically two or three to one.
p261
aVIf you put up a prize, you can get literally a 50 to one leverage on your dollars.
p262
aVAnd that's huge. And then he turned around and said,
p263
aV"Well, if you back a prize institute that runs a 10 prize, you get 500 to one."
p264
aVI said, "Well, that's great."
p265
aVSo, we have actually \u2014 are looking to turn the X PRIZE
p266
aVinto a world-class prize institute.
p267
aVThis is what happens when you put up a prize,
p268
aVwhen you announce it and teams start to begin doing trials.
p269
aVYou get publicity increase, and when it's won,
p270
aVpublicity shoots through the roof \u2014 if it's properly managed \u2014
p271
aVand that's part of the benefits to a sponsor.
p272
aVThen, when the prize is actually won, after it's moving,
p273
aVyou get societal benefits, you know, new technology, new capability.
p274
aVAnd the benefit to the sponsors
p275
aVis the sum of the publicity and societal benefits over the long term.
p276
aVThat's our value proposition in a prize.
p277
aa(lp278
VIf you were going to go and try to create SpaceShipOne,
p279
aVor any kind of a new technology,
p280
aVyou have to fund that from the beginning
p281
aVand maintain that funding with an uncertain outcome.
p282
aVIt may or may not happen. But if you put up a prize,
p283
aVthe beautiful thing is, you know, it's a very small maintenance fee,
p284
aVand you pay on success.
p285
aVOrteig didn't pay a dime out to the nine teams that went across \u2014
p286
aVtried to go across the Atlantic,
p287
aVand we didn't pay a dime until someone won the Ansari X PRIZE.
p288
aVSo, prizes work great.
p289
aVYou know, innovators, the entrepreneurs out there,
p290
aVyou know that when you're going for a goal,
p291
aVthe first thing you have to do is believe
p292
aVthat you can do it yourself.
p293
aVThen, you've got to, you know, face potential public ridicule
p294
aVof \u2014 that's a crazy idea, it'll never work.
p295
aVAnd then you have to convince others,
p296
aVso that they can, in fact, help you raise the funds,
p297
aVand then you've got to deal with the fact that you've got government bureaucracies
p298
aVand institutions that don't want you to move those things forward,
p299
aVand you have to deal with failures. What a prize does,
p300
aVwhat we've experienced a prize doing,
p301
aVis literally help to short-circuit or support all of these things,
p302
aVbecause a prize credentials the idea that this is a good idea.
p303
aVWell, it must be a good idea.
p304
aVSomeone's offering 10 million dollars to go and do this thing.
p305
aa(lp306
VAnd each of these areas was something that we found
p307
aVthe Ansari X PRIZE helped short-circuit these for innovation.
p308
aVSo, as an organization, we put together a prize discovery process
p309
aVof how to come up with prizes and write the rules,
p310
aVand we're actually looking at creating prizes
p311
aVin a number of different categories.
p312
aVWe're looking at attacking energy, environment, nanotechnology \u2014
p313
aVand I'll talk about those more in a moment.
p314
aVAnd the way we're doing that is we're creating prize teams
p315
aVwithin the X PRIZE. We have a space prize team.
p316
aVWe're going after an orbital prize.
p317
aa(lp318
VWe are looking at a number of energy prizes.
p319
aVCraig Venter has just joined our board
p320
aVand we're doing a rapid genome sequencing prize with him,
p321
aVwe'll be announcing later this fall,
p322
aVabout \u2014 imagine being able to sequence anybody's DNA
p323
aVfor under 1,000 dollars, revolutionize medicine.
p324
aVAnd clean water, education, medicine and even looking at social entrepreneurship.
p325
aVSo my final slide here is, the most critical tool
p326
aVfor solving humanity's grand challenges \u2014 it isn't technology,
p327
aVit isn't money, it's only one thing \u2014
p328
aVit's the committed, passionate human mind.
