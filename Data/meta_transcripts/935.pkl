VI was one of the founding members of the Axis of Evil Comedy Tour.
p4
aVThe other founding members included Ahmed Ahmed,
p5
aVwho is an Egyptian-American, who actually had the idea
p6
aVto go to the Middle East and try it out before we went out as a tour.
p7
aVHe went out solo and did it first.
p8
aVThen there was Aron Kader, who was the Palestinian-American.
p9
aVAnd then there was me, the Iranian-American of the group.
p10
aVNow, being Iranian-American presents its own set of problems,
p11
aVas you know.
p12
aVThose two countries aren't getting along these days.
p13
aVSo it causes a lot of inner conflict, you know,
p14
aVlike part of me likes me, part of me hates me.
p15
aa(lp16
V(Laughter)
p17
aa(lp18
VPart of me thinks I should have a nuclear program,
p19
aVthe other part thinks I can't be trusted with one.
p20
aVThese are dilemmas I have every day.
p21
aa(lp22
VBut I was born in Iran; I'm now an American citizen,
p23
aVwhich means I have the American passport,
p24
aVwhich means I can travel.
p25
aVBecause if you only have the Iranian passport,
p26
aVyou're kind of limited to the countries you can go to with open arms,
p27
aVyou know \u2014 Syria, Venezuela, North Korea.
p28
aa(lp29
V(Laughter)
p30
aa(lp31
VSo, anyone who's gotten their passport in America will tell you,
p32
aVwhen you get it, it still says what country you were born in.
p33
aVSo I remember getting my American passport.
p34
aVI was like, "Woo-hoo! I'm going to travel."
p35
aVAnd I opened it up, it said, "Born in Iran." I'm like, "Oh, come on, man!"
p36
aa(lp37
V(Laughter)
p38
aa(lp39
V"I'm trying to go places."
p40
aa(lp41
V(Laughter)
p42
aa(lp43
VBut what's interesting is,
p44
aVI've never had trouble in any Western countries with my American passport,
p45
aVeven though it says, "Born in Iran" \u2014 no problems.
p46
aVWhere I've had problems is in some of the Arab countries.
p47
aVI guess some of the Arab countries aren't getting along with Iran either.
p48
aVSo I was in Kuwait recently, doing a comedy show
p49
aVwith some other American comedians.
p50
aVThey all went through.
p51
aVThen the border patrol saw my American passport: "Ah-ha! American, great."
p52
aVThen he opened it up. "Born in Iran? Wait."
p53
aa(lp54
V(Laughter)
p55
aa(lp56
VAnd he started asking me questions.
p57
aVHe said, "What is your father's name?"
p58
aVI said, "Well, he's passed away, but his name was Khosro."
p59
aVHe goes, "What is your grandfather's name?"
p60
aVI said, "He passed away a long time ago.
p61
aVHis name was Jabbar."
p62
aVHe says, "You wait. I'll be back," and he walked away.
p63
aVAnd I started freaking out,
p64
aVbecause I don't know what kind of crap my grandfather was into.
p65
aa(lp66
V(Laughter)
p67
aa(lp68
VThought the guy was going to come back and be like,
p69
aV"We've been looking for you for 200 years."
p70
aa(lp71
V(Laughter)
p72
aa(lp73
V"Your grandfather has a parking violation. It's way overdue.
p74
aVYou owe us two billion dollars."
p75
aa(lp76
V(Laughter)
p77
aa(lp78
VBut as you can see, when I talk, I speak with an American accent,
p79
aVwhich you would think, as an Iranian-American actor,
p80
aVI should be able to play any part, good, bad, what have you.
p81
aVBut a lot of times in Hollywood,
p82
aVwhen casting directors find out you're of Middle Eastern descent,
p83
aVthey go, "Oh, you're Iranian. Great!
p84
aVCan you say 'I will kill you in the name of Allah?'"
p85
aVI go, "I could say that, but what if I were to say,
p86
aV'Hello. I'm your doctor'?"
p87
aVThey go, "Great! And then you hijack the hospital."
p88
aa(lp89
V(Laughter)
p90
aa(lp91
VLike, I think you're missing the point here.
p92
aVDon't get me wrong, I don't mind playing bad guys.
p93
aVI want to play a bad guy. I want to rob a bank.
p94
aVI want to rob a bank in a film,
p95
aVbut do it with a gun, not with a bomb strapped around me, right?
p96
aa(lp97
V(Laughter)
p98
aa(lp99
VBecause I imagine the director: "Maz, I think your character
p100
aVwould rob the bank with a bomb around him."
p101
aV"Why would I do that?
p102
aVIf I want the money, why would I kill myself?"
p103
aa(lp104
V(Laughter)
p105
aa(lp106
VRight?
p107
aa(lp108
V(Applause)
p109
aV"Gimme all your money, or I'll blow myself up!"
p110
aa(lp111
V(Laughter)
p112
aa(lp113
V"Well, then blow yourself up.
p114
aa(lp115
V(Laughter)
p116
aa(lp117
VJust do it outside, please."
p118
aa(lp119
V(Laughter)
p120
aa(lp121
VBut the fact is, there's good people everywhere.
p122
aVThat's what I try and show in my stand-up, good people everywhere.
p123
aVAll it takes in one person to mess it up.
p124
aVLike a couple months ago in Times Square in New York,
p125
aVthere was a Pakistani Muslim guy who tried to blow up a car bomb.
p126
aVNow, I happened to be in Times Square that night doing a comedy show.
p127
aVAnd a few months before that, there was a white American guy in Austin, Texas
p128
aVwho flew his airplane into the IRS building,
p129
aVand I happened to be in Austin that day doing a stand-up comedy show.
p130
aVNow I'll tell you, as a Middle-Eastern male,
p131
aVwhen you show up around a lot of these activities,
p132
aVyou start feeling guilty at one point.
p133
aa(lp134
V(Laughter)
p135
aa(lp136
VI was watching the news. I'm like, "Am I involved in this crap?"
p137
aa(lp138
V(Laughter)
p139
aa(lp140
V"I didn't get the memo. What's going on?"
p141
aa(lp142
V(Laughter)
p143
aa(lp144
VBut what was interesting was,
p145
aVthe Pakistani Muslim guy \u2014 see, he gives a bad name to Muslims
p146
aVand Middle Easterners and Pakistanis from all over the world.
p147
aVAnd one thing that happened there was also the Pakistani Taliban
p148
aVtook credit for that failed car bombing.
p149
aVMy question is: Why would you take credit for a failed car bombing?
p150
aV"We just want to say:
p151
aVwe tried."
p152
aa(lp153
V(Laughter)
p154
aa(lp155
V"And furthermore ...
p156
aa(lp157
V(Laughter)
p158
aa(lp159
Vit is the thought that counts."
p160
aa(lp161
V(Laughter)
p162
aa(lp163
V(Applause)
p164
aa(lp165
V"And in conclusion, win some, lose some."
p166
aa(lp167
V(Laughter)
p168
aa(lp169
VBut what happened was, when the white guy flew his plane into the building,
p170
aVI know all my Middle Eastern and Muslim friends in the States
p171
aVwere watching TV, going,
p172
aV"Please, don't be Middle Eastern. Don't be Hassan or Hussein."
p173
aVAnd the name came out: Jack. I'm like, "Woooo! That's not one of us!"
p174
aVBut I kept watching the news in case they came back,
p175
aVand were like, "Before he did it, he converted to Islam."
p176
aV"Damn it! Why Jack? Why?"
p177
aa(lp178
VBut the fact is, I've been lucky
p179
aVto get a chance to perform all over the world,
p180
aVand I did a lot of shows in the Middle East.
p181
aVI just did a seven-country solo tour.
p182
aVI was in Oman, and I was in Saudi Arabia.
p183
aVI was in Dubai.
p184
aVAnd it's great, there's good people everywhere.
p185
aVAnd you learn great things about these places.
p186
aVI encourage people always to go visit these places.
p187
aVFor example, Dubai \u2014 cool place.
p188
aVThey're obsessed with having the biggest, tallest, longest, as we all know.
p189
aVThey have a mall there, the Dubai Mall.
p190
aVIt is so big, they have taxis in the mall.
p191
aVI was walking. I heard, "Beep! Beep!" I'm like, "What are you doing here?"
p192
aVHe goes, "I'm going to the Zara store. It's three miles away.
p193
aVOut of my way. Out of my way. Out of my way."
p194
aa(lp195
V(Laughter)
p196
aa(lp197
VAnd what's crazy \u2014 there's a recession going on, even in Dubai,
p198
aVbut you wouldn't know by the prices.
p199
aVLike in the Dubai Mall, they sell frozen yogurt by the gram.
p200
aVIt's like a drug deal.
p201
aVI was walking by. The guy goes, "Psst! Habibi, my friend."
p202
aa(lp203
V(Laughter)
p204
aa(lp205
V"You want some frozen yogurt?
p206
aa(lp207
V(Laughter)
p208
aa(lp209
VCome here. Come here. Come here.
p210
aVI have one gram, five gram, 10 gram. How many gram do you want?"
p211
aa(lp212
V(Laughter)
p213
aa(lp214
VI bought five grams. 10 dollars. 10 dollars! I said, "What's in this?"
p215
aVHe's like, "Good stuff, man. Colombian. Top of the line."
p216
aa(lp217
V(Laughter)
p218
aa(lp219
VThe other thing you learn when you travel in these countries,
p220
aVin the Middle East, Latin American, South American countries,
p221
aVa lot of times when they build stuff, there's no rules and regulations.
p222
aVFor example, I took my two-year-old son to the playground at the Dubai Mall.
p223
aVAnd I've taken him to playgrounds all over the United States.
p224
aVAnd when you put your two-year-old on a slide in the United States,
p225
aVthey put something on the slide
p226
aVto slow the kid down as he comes down the slide.
p227
aVNot in the Middle East.
p228
aa(lp229
V(Laughter)
p230
aa(lp231
VI put my two-year-old on the slide, he went whoosh! He took off!
p232
aa(lp233
V(Laughter)
p234
aa(lp235
VI went down and, "Where's my son?" "On the third floor, sir. Third floor."
p236
aa(lp237
V(Laughter)
p238
aa(lp239
V"You take a taxi. You go to Zara. Make a left."
p240
aa(lp241
V(Laughter)
p242
aa(lp243
V"Try the yogurt. It's very good. Little expensive."
p244
aa(lp245
V(Laughter)
p246
aa(lp247
VBut one thing I try to do with my stand-up is break stereotypes.
p248
aVAnd I've been guilty of stereotyping as well.
p249
aVI was in Dubai. And there's a lot of Indians who work in Dubai.
p250
aVAnd they don't get paid that well.
p251
aVAnd I got it in my head that all the Indians must be workers.
p252
aVI forgot there's obviously successful Indians in Dubai too.
p253
aVI was doing a show, and they said, "We'll send a driver to pick you up."
p254
aVI went down to the lobby, and saw this Indian guy.
p255
aVI go, "He must be my driver,"
p256
aVsince he's standing there in a cheap suit, thin mustache, staring at me.
p257
aVI say, "Excuse me, are you my driver?"
p258
aVHe goes, "No, sir. I own the hotel."
p259
aa(lp260
V(Laughter)
p261
aa(lp262
VI go, "I'm sorry! Why were you staring at me?"
p263
aVHe goes, "I thought you were my driver."
p264
aa(lp265
V(Laughter)
p266
aa(lp267
V(Applause)
p268
aa(lp269
V(Laughter)
p270
aa(lp271
VI'll leave you with this: I try, with my stand-up, to break stereotypes,
p272
aVpresent Middle Easterners and Muslims in a positive light.
p273
aVI hope that in the coming years,
p274
aVmore film and television programs come out of Hollywood,
p275
aVpresenting us in a positive light.
p276
aVWho knows? Maybe one day, we'll even have our own James Bond. Right?
p277
aV"My name is Bond.
p278
aVJamal Bond."
p279
aa(lp280
V(Laughter)
p281
aa(lp282
VTil then, I'll keep telling jokes. Hope you keep laughing.
p283
aVHave a good day. Thank you.
