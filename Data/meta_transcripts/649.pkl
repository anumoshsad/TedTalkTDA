VI run a design studio in New York.
p4
aVEvery seven years, I close it for one year
p5
aVto pursue
p6
aVsome little experiments, things that
p7
aVare always difficult to accomplish
p8
aVduring the regular working year.
p9
aVIn that year, we are not available
p10
aVfor any of our clients.
p11
aVWe are totally closed.
p12
aVAnd as you can imagine,
p13
aVit is a lovely and very energetic time.
p14
aa(lp15
VI originally had opened the studio in New York
p16
aVto combine my two loves, music and design.
p17
aVAnd we created videos and packaging
p18
aVfor many musicians that you know,
p19
aVand for even more that you've never heard of.
p20
aVAs I realized, just like with many many things in my life
p21
aVthat I actually love,
p22
aVI adapt to it.
p23
aVAnd I get, over time, bored by them.
p24
aVAnd for sure, in our case,
p25
aVour work started to look the same.
p26
aVYou see here a glass eye in a die cut of a book.
p27
aVQuite the similar idea, then, a perfume packaged
p28
aVin a book, in a die cut.
p29
aVSo I decided to close it down for one year.
p30
aa(lp31
VAlso is the knowledge that
p32
aVright now we spend about
p33
aVin the first 25 years of our lives learning,
p34
aVthen there is another 40 years
p35
aVthat's really reserved for working.
p36
aVAnd then tacked on at the end of it
p37
aVare about 15 years for retirement.
p38
aVAnd I thought it might be helpful
p39
aVto basically cut off five of those retirement years
p40
aVand intersperse them in between those working years.
p41
aV(Applause)
p42
aVThat's clearly enjoyable for myself.
p43
aVBut probably even more important is
p44
aVthat the work that comes out of these years
p45
aVflows back into the company
p46
aVand into society at large,
p47
aVrather than just benefiting a grandchild or two.
p48
aa(lp49
VThere is a fellow TEDster who spoke two years ago,
p50
aVJonathan Haidt,
p51
aVwho defined his work into three different levels.
p52
aVAnd they rang very true for me.
p53
aVI can see my work as a job. I do it for money.
p54
aVI likely already look forward to the weekend on Thursdays.
p55
aVAnd I probably will need a hobby as a leveling mechanism.
p56
aVIn a career I'm definitely more engaged.
p57
aVBut at the same time, there will be periods when I think
p58
aVis all that really hard work really worth my while?
p59
aVWhile in the third one, in the calling,
p60
aVvery much likely I would do it also
p61
aVif I wouldn't be financially compensated for it.
p62
aa(lp63
VI am not a religious person myself,
p64
aVbut I did look for nature.
p65
aVI had spent my first sabbatical in New York City.
p66
aVLooked for something different for the second one.
p67
aVEurope and the U.S. didn't really feel enticing
p68
aVbecause I knew them too well. So Asia it was.
p69
aVThe most beautiful landscapes I had seen in Asia
p70
aVwere Sri Lanka and Bali.
p71
aVSri Lanka still had the civil war going on, so Bali it was.
p72
aVIt's a wonderful, very craft-oriented society.
p73
aa(lp74
VI arrived there in September 2008,
p75
aVand pretty much started to work right away.
p76
aVThere is wonderful inspiration coming from the area itself.
p77
aVHowever the first thing that I needed was
p78
aVmosquito repellent typography
p79
aVbecause they were definitely around heavily.
p80
aVAnd then I needed some sort of way
p81
aVto be able to get back to all the wild dogs
p82
aVthat surround my house,
p83
aVand attacked me during my morning walks.
p84
aVSo we created this series of 99 portraits on tee shirts.
p85
aVEvery single dog on one tee shirt.
p86
aVAs a little retaliation
p87
aVwith a just ever so slightly menacing message
p88
aV(Laughter)
p89
aVon the back of the shirt.
p90
aV(Laughter)
p91
aa(lp92
VJust before I left New York
p93
aVI decided I could actually renovate my studio.
p94
aVAnd then just leave it all to them.
p95
aVAnd I don't have to do anything.
p96
aVSo I looked for furniture.
p97
aVAnd it turned out that
p98
aVall the furniture that I really liked,
p99
aVI couldn't afford.
p100
aVAnd all the stuff I could afford, I didn't like.
p101
aVSo one of the things that we pursued in Bali
p102
aVwas pieces of furniture.
p103
aVThis one, of course, still works with the wild dogs.
p104
aVIt's not quite finished yet.
p105
aVAnd I think by the time this lamp came about,
p106
aV(Laughter)
p107
aVI had finally made peace with those dogs.
p108
aV(Laughter)
p109
aa(lp110
VThen there is a coffee table. I also did a coffee table.
p111
aVIt's called Be Here Now.
p112
aVIt includes 330 compasses.
p113
aVAnd we had custom espresso cups made
p114
aVthat hide a magnet inside,
p115
aVand make those compasses go crazy,
p116
aValways centering on them.
p117
aVThen this is a fairly talkative, verbose kind of chair.
p118
aVI also started meditating for the first time in my life in Bali.
p119
aVAnd at the same time, I'm extremely aware
p120
aVhow boring it is to hear about other people's happinesses.
p121
aVSo I will not really go too far into it.
p122
aa(lp123
VMany of you will know this TEDster,
p124
aVDanny Gilbert, whose book, actually,
p125
aVI got it through the TED book club.
p126
aVI think it took me four years
p127
aVto finally read it, while on sabbatical.
p128
aVAnd I was pleased to see
p129
aVthat he actually wrote the book while he was on sabbatical.
p130
aVAnd I'll show you a couple of people
p131
aVthat did well by pursuing sabbaticals.
p132
aa(lp133
VThis is Ferran Adria. Many people think
p134
aVhe is right now the best chef in the world
p135
aVwith his restaurant north of Barcelona, El Bulli.
p136
aVHis restaurant is open seven months every year.
p137
aVHe closes it down for five months
p138
aVto experiment with a full kitchen staff.
p139
aVHis latest numbers are fairly impressive.
p140
aVHe can seat, throughout the year,
p141
aVhe can seat 8,000 people.
p142
aVAnd he has 2.2 million requests for reservations.
p143
aa(lp144
VIf I look at my cycle, seven years, one year sabbatical,
p145
aVit's 12.5 percent of my time.
p146
aVAnd if I look at companies that are actually more successful than mine,
p147
aV3M since the 1930s
p148
aVis giving all their engineers
p149
aV15 percent to pursue whatever they want.
p150
aVThere is some good successes.
p151
aVScotch tape came out of this program,
p152
aVas well as Art Fry developed
p153
aVsticky notes from during his personal time for 3M.
p154
aVGoogle, of course, very famously
p155
aVgives 20 percent for their software engineers
p156
aVto pursue their own personal projects.
p157
aa(lp158
VAnybody in here has actually ever conducted a sabbatical?
p159
aVThat's about five percent of everybody.
p160
aVSo I'm not sure if you saw your neighbor putting their hand up.
p161
aVTalk to them about if it was successful or not.
p162
aVI've found that
p163
aVfinding out about what I'm going to like in the future,
p164
aVmy very best way is to talk to people
p165
aVwho have actually done it
p166
aVmuch better than myself envisioning it.
p167
aa(lp168
VWhen I had the idea of doing one,
p169
aVthe process was I made the decision and I put it into my daily planner book.
p170
aVAnd then I told as many, many people as I possibly could about it
p171
aVso that there was no way that I could chicken out later on.
p172
aV(Laughter)
p173
aa(lp174
VIn the beginning, on the first sabbatical,
p175
aVit was rather disastrous.
p176
aVI had thought that I should do this without any plan,
p177
aVthat this vacuum of time somehow would
p178
aVbe wonderful and enticing
p179
aVfor idea generation. It was not.
p180
aVI just, without a plan, I just reacted
p181
aVto little requests, not work requests,
p182
aVthose I all said no to, but other little requests.
p183
aVSending mail to Japanese design magazines and things like that.
p184
aVSo I became my own intern.
p185
aV(Laughter)
p186
aa(lp187
VAnd I very quickly
p188
aVmade a list of the things I was interested in,
p189
aVput them in a hierarchy, divided them into chunks of time
p190
aVand then made a plan, very much like in grade school.
p191
aVWhat does it say here? Monday, 8 to 9: story writing;
p192
aV9 to 10: future thinking.
p193
aVWas not very successful. And so on and so forth.
p194
aVAnd that actually, specifically as a starting point
p195
aVof the first sabbatical, worked really well for me.
p196
aVWhat came out of it?
p197
aVI really got close to design again.
p198
aVI had fun.
p199
aVFinancially, seen over the long term, it was actually successful.
p200
aVBecause of the improved quality, we could ask for higher prices.
p201
aa(lp202
VAnd probably most importantly,
p203
aVbasically everything we've done
p204
aVin the seven years following the first sabbatical
p205
aVcame out of thinking of that one single year.
p206
aVAnd I'll show you a couple of projects
p207
aVthat came out of the seven years following that sabbatical.
p208
aVOne of the strands of thinking I was involved in was
p209
aVthat sameness is so incredibly overrated.
p210
aVThis whole idea that everything needs to be exactly the same
p211
aVworks for a very very few strand of companies,
p212
aVand not for everybody else.
p213
aa(lp214
VWe were asked to design an identity for Casa da Musica,
p215
aVthe Rem Koolhaas-built music center
p216
aVin Porto, in Portugal.
p217
aVAnd even though I desired to do an identity
p218
aVthat doesn't use the architecture,
p219
aVI failed at that.
p220
aVAnd mostly also because I realized
p221
aVout of a Rem Koolhaas presentation to the city of Porto, where
p222
aVhe talked about a conglomeration of various layers of meaning.
p223
aVWhich I understood after I
p224
aVtranslated it from architecture speech
p225
aVin to regular English,
p226
aVbasically as logo making.
p227
aVAnd I understood that the building itself was a logo.
p228
aa(lp229
VSo then it became quite easy.
p230
aVWe put a mask on it,
p231
aVlooked at it deep down in the ground,
p232
aVchecked it out from all sides,
p233
aVwest, north, south, east,
p234
aVtop and bottom.
p235
aVColored them in a very particular way
p236
aVby having a friend of mine write a piece of software,
p237
aVthe Casa da Musica Logo Generator.
p238
aVThat's connected to a scanner.
p239
aVYou put any image in there, like that Beethoven image.
p240
aVAnd the software, in a second,
p241
aVwill give you the Casa da Musica Beethoven logo.
p242
aVWhich, when you actually have to design a Beethoven poster,
p243
aVcomes in handy, because the visual information of the logo
p244
aVand the actual poster is exactly the same.
p245
aa(lp246
VSo it will always fit together, conceptually, of course.
p247
aVIf Zappa's music is performed, it gets its own logo.
p248
aVOr Philip Glass or Lou Reed or the Chemical Brothers,
p249
aVwho all performed there, get their own
p250
aVCasa da Musica logo.
p251
aVIt works the same internally with the president or the musical director,
p252
aVwhose Casa da Musica portraits wind up on their business cards.
p253
aVThere is a full-blown orchestra
p254
aVliving inside the building.
p255
aVIt has a more transparent identity.
p256
aVThe truck they go on tour with.
p257
aVOr there's a smaller contemporary orchestra,
p258
aV12 people that remixes its own title.
p259
aa(lp260
VAnd one of the handy things that came about
p261
aVwas that you could take the logo type
p262
aVand create advertising out of it.
p263
aVLike this Donna Toney poster,
p264
aVor Chopin, or Mozart,
p265
aVor La Monte Young.
p266
aVYou can take the shape and make typography out of it.
p267
aVYou can grow it underneath the skin.
p268
aVYou can have a poster for a family event in front of the house,
p269
aVor a rave underneath the house
p270
aVor a weekly program,
p271
aVas well as educational services.
p272
aa(lp273
VSecond insight. So far, until that point I had
p274
aVbeen mostly involved
p275
aVor used the language of design
p276
aVfor promotional purposes,
p277
aVwhich was fine with me.
p278
aVOn one hand I have nothing against selling.
p279
aVMy parents are both salespeople.
p280
aVBut I did feel that
p281
aVI spent so much time learning this language,
p282
aVwhy do I only promote with it?
p283
aVThere must be something else.
p284
aVAnd the whole series of work came out of it.
p285
aVSome of you might have seen it.
p286
aVI showed some of it
p287
aVat earlier TEDs before,
p288
aVunder the title "Things I've Learned in My Life So Far."
p289
aVI'll just show two now.
p290
aa(lp291
VThis is a whole wall of bananas
p292
aVat different ripenesses
p293
aVon the opening day in this gallery in New York.
p294
aVIt says, "Self-confidence produces fine results."
p295
aVThis is after a week.
p296
aVAfter two weeks,
p297
aVthree weeks, four weeks, five weeks.
p298
aVAnd you see the self confidence almost comes back,
p299
aVbut not quite.
p300
aVThese are some pictures visitors sent to me.
p301
aV(Laughter)
p302
aa(lp303
VAnd then the city of Amsterdam
p304
aVgave us a plaza and asked us to do something.
p305
aVWe used the stone plates as a grid
p306
aVfor our little piece.
p307
aVWe got 250,000 coins from the central bank,
p308
aVat different darknesses.
p309
aVSo we got brand new ones, shiny ones,
p310
aVmedium ones, and very old, dark ones.
p311
aVAnd with the help of 100 volunteers, over a week,
p312
aVcreated this fairly floral typography
p313
aVthat spelled, "Obsessions make my life worse
p314
aVand my work better."
p315
aa(lp316
VAnd the idea of course was to
p317
aVmake the type so precious
p318
aVthat as an audience
p319
aVyou would be in between,
p320
aV"Should I really take as much money as I can?
p321
aVOr should I leave the piece intact as it is right now?"
p322
aVWhile we built all this up
p323
aVduring that week, with the 100 volunteers,
p324
aVa good number of the neighbors surrounding the plaza
p325
aVgot very close to it and quite loved it.
p326
aVSo when it was finally done,
p327
aVand in the first night
p328
aVa guy came with big plastic bags
p329
aVand scooped up as many coins as he could possibly carry,
p330
aVone of the neighbors called the police.
p331
aa(lp332
VAnd the Amsterdam police
p333
aVin all their wisdom,
p334
aVcame, saw,
p335
aVand they wanted to protect the artwork.
p336
aVAnd they swept it all up and put it into custody
p337
aVat police headquarters.
p338
aV(Laughter)
p339
aVI think you see, you see them sweeping. You see them sweeping right here.
p340
aVThat's the police, getting rid of it all.
p341
aVSo after eight hours
p342
aVthat's pretty much all that was left
p343
aVof the whole thing.
p344
aV(Laughter)
p345
aa(lp346
VWe are also working on the start of a bigger project in Bali.
p347
aVIt's a movie about happiness.
p348
aVAnd here we asked some nearby pigs
p349
aVto do the titles for us.
p350
aVThey weren't quite slick enough.
p351
aVSo we asked the goose to do it again,
p352
aVand hoped she would do somehow,
p353
aVa more elegant or pretty job.
p354
aVAnd I think she overdid it.
p355
aVJust a bit too ornamental.
p356
aVAnd my studio is very close to the monkey forest.
p357
aVAnd the monkeys in that monkey forest
p358
aVlooked, actually, fairly happy.
p359
aVSo we asked those guys to do it again.
p360
aVThey did a fine job, but had
p361
aVa couple of readability problems.
p362
aVSo of course whatever you don't really do yourself
p363
aVdoesn't really get done properly.
p364
aa(lp365
VThat film we'll be working on for the next two years.
p366
aVSo it's going to be a while.
p367
aVAnd of course you might think that
p368
aVdoing a film on happiness
p369
aVmight not really be worthwhile.
p370
aVThen you can of course always
p371
aVgo and see this guy.
p372
aa(lp373
VVideo: (Laughter)
p374
aVAnd I'm happy I'm alive.
p375
aVI'm happy I'm alive. I'm happy I'm alive.
