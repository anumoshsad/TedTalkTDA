VHow many of you have used an electronic spreadsheet,
p4
aVlike Microsoft Excel?
p5
aVVery good.
p6
aVNow, how many of you have run a business with a spreadsheet by hand,
p7
aVlike my dad did for his small printing business in Philadelphia?
p8
aVA lot less.
p9
aa(lp10
VWell, that's the way it was done for hundreds of years.
p11
aVIn early 1978, I started working on an idea
p12
aVthat eventually became VisiCalc.
p13
aVAnd the next year it shipped
p14
aVrunning on something new called an Apple II personal computer.
p15
aVYou could tell that things had really changed when, six years later,
p16
aVthe Wall Street Journal ran an editorial
p17
aVthat assumed you knew what VisiCalc was and maybe even were using it.
p18
aa(lp19
VSteve Jobs back in 1990
p20
aVsaid that "spreadsheets propelled the industry forward."
p21
aV"VisiCalc propelled the success of Apple more than any other single event."
p22
aVOn a more personal note,
p23
aVSteve said, "If VisiCalc had been written for some other computer,
p24
aVyou'd be interviewing somebody else right now."
p25
aa(lp26
VSo, VisiCalc was instrumental in getting personal computers on business desks.
p27
aVHow did it come about?
p28
aVWhat was it? What did I go through to make it be what it was?
p29
aVWell, I first learned to program back in 1966, when I was 15 \u2014
p30
aVjust a couple months after this photo was taken.
p31
aVFew high schoolers had access to computers in those days.
p32
aVBut through luck and an awful lot of perseverance,
p33
aVI was able to get computer time around the city.
p34
aa(lp35
VAfter sleeping in the mud at Woodstock, I went off to MIT to go to college,
p36
aVwhere to make money, I worked on the Multics Project.
p37
aVMultics was a trailblazing interactive time-sharing system.
p38
aVHave you heard of the Linux and Unix operating systems?
p39
aVThey came from Multics.
p40
aVI worked on the Multics versions
p41
aVof what are known as interpreted computer languages,
p42
aVthat are used by people in noncomputer fields
p43
aVto do their calculations while seated at a computer terminal.
p44
aa(lp45
VAfter I graduated from MIT,
p46
aVI went to work for Digital Equipment Corporation.
p47
aVAt DEC, I worked on software
p48
aVfor the new area of computerized typesetting.
p49
aVI helped newspapers replace their reporters' typewriters
p50
aVwith computer terminals.
p51
aVI'd write software
p52
aVand then I'd go out in the field to places like the Kansas City Star,
p53
aVwhere I would train users and get feedback.
p54
aVThis was real-world experience
p55
aVthat is quite different than what I saw in the lab at MIT.
p56
aa(lp57
VAfter that, I was project leader
p58
aVof the software for DEC's first word processor, again a new field.
p59
aVLike with typesetting, the important thing was crafting a user interface
p60
aVthat was both natural and efficient for noncomputer people to use.
p61
aVAfter I was at DEC, I went to work for a small company
p62
aVthat made microprocessor-based electronic cash registers for the fast-food industry.
p63
aVBut I had always wanted to start a company with my friend Bob Frankston
p64
aVthat I met on the Multics project at MIT.
p65
aa(lp66
VSo I decided to go back to school to learn as much as I could about business.
p67
aVAnd in the fall of 1977,
p68
aVI entered the MBA program at Harvard Business School.
p69
aVI was one of the few percentage of students
p70
aVwho had a background in computer programming.
p71
aVThere's a picture of me from the yearbook sitting in the front row.
p72
aa(lp73
V(Laughter)
p74
aa(lp75
VNow, at Harvard, we learned by the case method.
p76
aVWe'd do about three cases a day.
p77
aVCases consist of up to a few dozen pages describing particular business situations.
p78
aVThey often have exhibits, and exhibits often have words and numbers
p79
aVlaid out in ways that make sense for the particular situation.
p80
aVThey're usually all somewhat different.
p81
aVHere's my homework.
p82
aVAgain, numbers, words, laid out in ways that made sense.
p83
aVLots of calculations \u2014 we got really close to our calculators.
p84
aVIn fact, here's my calculator.
p85
aVFor Halloween, I went dressed up as a calculator.
p86
aa(lp87
V(Laughter)
p88
aa(lp89
VAt the beginning of each class, the professor would call on somebody
p90
aVto present the case.
p91
aVWhat they would do is they would explain what was going on
p92
aVand then dictate information that the professor would transcribe
p93
aVonto the many motorized blackboards in the front of the class,
p94
aVand then we'd have a discussion.
p95
aVOne of the really frustrating things is when you've done all your homework,
p96
aVyou come in the next day only to find out that you made an error
p97
aVand all of the other numbers you did were wrong.
p98
aVAnd you couldn't participate as well.
p99
aVAnd we were marked by class participation.
p100
aa(lp101
VSo, sitting there with 87 other people in the class, I got to daydream a lot.
p102
aVMost programmers in those days worked on mainframes,
p103
aVbuilding things like inventory systems, payroll systems and bill-paying systems.
p104
aVBut I had worked on interactive word processing
p105
aVand on-demand personal computation.
p106
aVInstead of thinking about paper printouts and punch cards,
p107
aVI imagined a magic blackboard
p108
aVthat if you erased one number and wrote a new thing in,
p109
aVall of the other numbers would automatically change,
p110
aVlike word processing with numbers.
p111
aVI imagined that my calculator had mouse hardware on the bottom of it
p112
aVand a head-up display, like in a fighter plane.
p113
aVAnd I could type some numbers in, and circle it, and press the sum button.
p114
aVAnd right in the middle of a negotiation I'd be able to get the answer.
p115
aVNow I just had to take my fantasy and turn it into reality.
p116
aa(lp117
VMy father taught me about prototyping.
p118
aVHe showed me mock-ups
p119
aVthat he'd make to figure out the placement on the page
p120
aVfor the things for brochures that he was printing.
p121
aVAnd he'd use it to get feedback from customers
p122
aVand OKs before he sent the job off to the presses.
p123
aVThe act of making a simple, working version of what you're trying to build
p124
aVforces you to uncover key problems.
p125
aVAnd it lets you find solutions to those problems much less expensively.
p126
aa(lp127
VSo I decided to build a prototype.
p128
aVI went to a video terminal connected to Harvard's time-sharing system
p129
aVand got to work.
p130
aVOne of the first problems that I ran into was:
p131
aVHow do you represent values in formulas?
p132
aVLet me show you what I mean.
p133
aVI thought that you would point somewhere,
p134
aVtype in some words, then type in some somewhere else,
p135
aVput in some numbers and some more numbers, point where you want the answer.
p136
aVAnd then point to the first, press minus, point to the second,
p137
aVand get the result.
p138
aVThe problem was: What should I put in the formula?
p139
aVIt had to be something the computer knew what to put in.
p140
aVAnd if you looked at the formula,
p141
aVyou needed to know where on the screen it referred to.
p142
aVThe first thing I thought was the programmer way of doing it.
p143
aVThe first time you pointed to somewhere,
p144
aVthe computer would ask you to type in a unique name.
p145
aVIt became pretty clear pretty fast that that was going to be too tedious.
p146
aVThe computer had to automatically make up the name and put it inside.
p147
aVSo I thought, why not make it be the order in which you create them?
p148
aVI tried that. Value 1, value 2.
p149
aVPretty quickly I saw that if you had more than a few values
p150
aVyou'd never remember on the screen where things were.
p151
aa(lp152
VThen I said, why not instead of allowing you to put values anywhere,
p153
aVI'll restrict you to a grid?
p154
aVThen when you pointed to a cell,
p155
aVthe computer could put the row and column in as a name.
p156
aVAnd, if I did it like a map and put ABC across the top and numbers along the side,
p157
aVif you saw B7 in a formula,
p158
aVyou'd know exactly where it was on the screen.
p159
aVAnd if you had to type the formula in yourself, you'd know what to do.
p160
aVRestricting you to a grid helped solve my problem.
p161
aVIt also opened up new capabilities, like the ability to have ranges of cells.
p162
aVBut it wasn't too restrictive \u2014
p163
aVyou could still put any value, any formula, in any cell.
p164
aVAnd that's the way we do it to this day, almost 40 years later.
p165
aa(lp166
VMy friend Bob and I decided that we were going to build this product together.
p167
aVI did more work figuring out exactly how the program was supposed to behave.
p168
aVI wrote a reference card to act as documentation.
p169
aVIt also helped me ensure that the user interface I was defining
p170
aVcould be explained concisely and clearly to regular people.
p171
aVBob worked in the attic of the apartment he rented in Arlington, Massachusetts.
p172
aVThis is the inside of the attic.
p173
aVBob bought time on the MIT Multics System
p174
aVto write computer code on a terminal like this.
p175
aVAnd then he would download test versions to a borrowed Apple II
p176
aVover a phone line using an acoustic coupler,
p177
aVand then we would test.
p178
aa(lp179
VFor one of these tests I prepared for this case about the Pepsi Challenge.
p180
aVPrint wasn't working yet, so I had to copy everything down.
p181
aVSave wasn't working, so every time it crashed,
p182
aVI had to type in all of the formulas again, over and over again.
p183
aVThe next day in class, I raised my hand; I got called on, and I presented the case.
p184
aVI did five-year projections. I did all sorts of different scenarios.
p185
aVI aced the case. VisiCalc was already useful.
p186
aa(lp187
VThe professor said, "How did you do it?"
p188
aVWell, I didn't want to tell him about our secret program.
p189
aa(lp190
V(Laughter)
p191
aa(lp192
VSo I said, "I took this and added this
p193
aVand multiplied by this and subtracted that."
p194
aa(lp195
VHe said, "Well, why didn't you use a ratio?"
p196
aa(lp197
VI said, "Hah! A ratio \u2014 that wouldn't have been as exact!"
p198
aVWhat I didn't say was, "Divide isn't working yet."
p199
aa(lp200
V(Laughter)
p201
aa(lp202
VEventually, though, we did finish enough of VisiCalc
p203
aVto be able to show it to the public.
p204
aVMy dad printed up a sample reference card
p205
aVthat we could use as marketing material.
p206
aa(lp207
VIn June of 1979, our publisher announced VisiCalc to the world,
p208
aVin a small booth at the giant National Computer Conference in New York City.
p209
aVThe New York Times had a humorous article about the conference.
p210
aV"The machines perform what seem religious rites ...
p211
aVEven as the believers gather,
p212
aVthe painters in the Coliseum sign room are adding to the pantheon,
p213
aVcarefully lettering 'VISICALC' in giant black on yellow.
p214
aVAll hail VISICALC!"
p215
aV(Gasp) New York Times: "All hail VISICALC."
p216
aa(lp217
V(Laughter)
p218
aa(lp219
VThat was the last mention of the electronic spreadsheet
p220
aVin the popular business press for about two years.
p221
aVMost people didn't get it yet.
p222
aVBut some did.
p223
aa(lp224
VIn October of 1979, we shipped VisiCalc.
p225
aVIt came in packaging that looked like this.
p226
aVAnd it looked like this running on the Apple II.
p227
aVAnd the rest, as they say, is history.
p228
aa(lp229
VNow, there's an awful lot more to this story,
p230
aVbut that'll have to wait for another day.
p231
aVOne thing, though, Harvard remembers.
p232
aVHere's that classroom.
p233
aVThey put up a plaque to commemorate what happened there.
p234
aa(lp235
V(Applause)
p236
aa(lp237
VBut it also serves as a reminder
p238
aVthat you, too, should take your unique backgrounds, skills and needs
p239
aVand build prototypes to discover and work out the key problems,
p240
aVand through that, change the world.
p241

VThank you.
