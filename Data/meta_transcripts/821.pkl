VThank you. I have two missions here today.
p4
aVThe first is to tell you something about pollen, I hope,
p5
aVand to convince you that it's more than just something that gets up your nose.
p6
aVAnd, secondly, to convince you
p7
aVthat every home really ought to have a scanning electron microscope.
p8
aV(Laughter)
p9
aVPollen is a flower's way of making more flowers.
p10
aVIt carries male sex cells
p11
aVfrom one flower to another.
p12
aVThis gives us genetic diversity,
p13
aVor at least it gives the plants genetic diversity.
p14
aVAnd it's really rather better not to mate with yourself.
p15
aVThat's probably true of humans as well, mostly.
p16
aa(lp17
VPollen is produced by the anthers of flowers.
p18
aVEach anther can carry up to 100,000 grains of pollen,
p19
aVso, it's quite prolific stuff.
p20
aVAnd it isn't just bright flowers
p21
aVthat have pollen; it's also trees and grasses.
p22
aVAnd remember that all our cereal crops are grasses as well.
p23
aa(lp24
VHere is a scanning electron micrograph of a grain of pollen.
p25
aVThe little hole in the middle, we'll come to a bit later,
p26
aVbut that's for the pollen tube
p27
aVto come out later on. A very tiny tube.
p28
aVSo, that's 20 micrometers across,
p29
aVthat pollen grain there.
p30
aVThat's about a 50th of a millimeter.
p31
aVBut not all pollen is quite so simple looking.
p32
aa(lp33
VThis is Morina. This is a plant \u2014
p34
aVwhich I've always thought to be rather tedious \u2014
p35
aVnamed after Morin,
p36
aVwho was an enterprising French gardener,
p37
aVwho issued the first seed catalog
p38
aVin 1621.
p39
aVBut anyway, take a look at its pollen.
p40
aVThis is amazing, I think.
p41
aVThat little hole in the middle there is for the pollen tube,
p42
aVand when the pollen finds its special female spot
p43
aVin another Morina flower,
p44
aVjust on the right species, what happens?
p45
aVLike I said, pollen carries the male sex cells.
p46
aVIf you actually didn't realize that plants have sex,
p47
aVthey have rampant, promiscuous
p48
aVand really quite interesting and curious sex. Really.
p49
aV(Laughter) A lot.
p50
aa(lp51
VMy story is actually not about plant propagation,
p52
aVbut about pollen itself.
p53
aV"So, what are pollen's properties?" I hear you ask.
p54
aVFirst of all, pollen is tiny. Yes we know that.
p55
aVIt's also very biologically active,
p56
aVas anyone with hay fever will understand.
p57
aVNow, pollen from plants, which are wind-dispersed \u2014
p58
aVlike trees and grasses and so on \u2014
p59
aVtend to cause the most hay fever.
p60
aVAnd the reason for that is they've got to chuck out
p61
aVmasses and masses of pollen to have any chance
p62
aVof the pollen reaching another plant of the same species.
p63
aa(lp64
VHere are some examples \u2014
p65
aVthey're very smooth if you look at them \u2014
p66
aVof tree pollen that is meant to be carried by the wind.
p67
aVAgain \u2014 this time, sycamore \u2014 wind-dispersed.
p68
aVSo, trees: very boring flowers,
p69
aVnot really trying to attract insects.
p70
aVCool pollen, though.
p71
aVThis one I particularly like.
p72
aVThis is the Monterey Pine, which has little air sacks
p73
aVto make the pollen carry even further.
p74
aVRemember, that thing is just about 30 micrometers across.
p75
aa(lp76
VNow, it's much more efficient if you can get insects to do your bidding.
p77
aVThis is a bee's leg
p78
aVwith the pollen glommed onto it from a mallow plant.
p79
aVAnd this is the outrageous and beautiful
p80
aVflower of the mangrove palm.
p81
aVVery showy, to attract lots of insects to do its bidding.
p82
aVThe pollen has little barbs on it,
p83
aVif we look.
p84
aVNow, those little barbs
p85
aVobviously stick to the insects well,
p86
aVbut there is something else that we can tell from this photograph,
p87
aVand that is that you might be able to see a fracture line
p88
aVacross what would be the equator of this, if it was the Earth.
p89
aVThat tells me that it's actually been fossilized, this pollen.
p90
aVAnd I'm rather proud to say
p91
aVthat this was found just near London, and that 55 million years ago
p92
aVLondon was full of mangroves.
p93
aVIsn't that cool?
p94
aV(Laughter)
p95
aa(lp96
VOkay, so this is another species evolved to be dispersed by insects.
p97
aVYou can tell that from the little barbs on there.
p98
aVAll these pictures were taken with a scanning electron microscope,
p99
aVactually in the lab at Kew Laboratories.
p100
aVNo coincidence that these were taken
p101
aVby Rob Kesseler, who is an artist,
p102
aVand I think it's someone with a design and artistic eye
p103
aVlike him that has managed to bring out the best in pollen.
p104
aV(Laughter)
p105
aa(lp106
VNow, all this diversity
p107
aVmeans that you can look at a pollen grain
p108
aVand tell what species it came from,
p109
aVand that's actually quite handy if you
p110
aVmaybe have a sample and you want to see where it came from.
p111
aVSo, different species of plants
p112
aVgrow in different places,
p113
aVand some pollen carries further than others.
p114
aVSo, if you have a pollen sample,
p115
aVthen in principle, you should be able to tell
p116
aVwhere that sample came from.
p117
aVAnd this is where it gets interesting for forensics.
p118
aa(lp119
VPollen is tiny. It gets on to things, and it sticks to them.
p120
aVSo, not only does each type of pollen look different,
p121
aVbut each habitat has a different combination of plants.
p122
aVA different pollen signature, if you like,
p123
aVor a different pollen fingerprint.
p124
aVBy looking at the proportions and combinations
p125
aVof different kinds of pollen in a sample,
p126
aVyou can tell very precisely where it came from.
p127
aVThis is some pollen embedded in a cotton shirt,
p128
aVsimilar to the one that I'm wearing now.
p129
aVNow, much of the pollen will still be there
p130
aVafter repeated washings.
p131
aVWhere has it been?
p132
aVFour very different habitats might look similar,
p133
aVbut they've got very different pollen signatures.
p134
aVActually this one is particularly easy, these pictures were all taken
p135
aVin different countries.
p136
aa(lp137
VBut pollen forensics can be very subtle.
p138
aVIt's being used now to track
p139
aVwhere counterfeit drugs have been made,
p140
aVwhere banknotes have come from,
p141
aVto look at the provenance of antiques
p142
aVand see that they really did come from the place
p143
aVthe seller said they did.
p144
aVAnd murder suspects have been tracked
p145
aVusing their clothing,
p146
aVcertainly in the U.K., to within an area
p147
aVthat's small enough that you can send in tracker dogs
p148
aVto find the murder victim.
p149
aVSo, you can tell from a piece of clothing
p150
aVto within about a kilometer or so,
p151
aVwhere that piece of clothing has been recently
p152
aVand then send in dogs.
p153
aVAnd finally, in a rather grizzly way,
p154
aVthe Bosnia war crimes;
p155
aVsome of the people brought to trial were brought to trial
p156
aVbecause of the evidence from pollen,
p157
aVwhich showed that bodies had been buried,
p158
aVexhumed and then reburied somewhere else.
p159
aa(lp160
VI hope I've opened your eyes,
p161
aVif you'll excuse the visual pun, (Laughter)
p162
aVto some of pollen's secrets.
p163
aVThis is a horse chestnut.
p164
aVThere is an invisible beauty all around us,
p165
aVeach grain with a story to tell ...
p166
aVeach of us, in fact, with a story to tell
p167
aVfrom the pollen fingerprint that's upon us.
p168
aVThank you to the colleagues at Kew,
p169
aVand thank you to palynologists everywhere.
