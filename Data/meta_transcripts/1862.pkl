VSo why do we learn mathematics?
p4
aVEssentially, for three reasons:
p5
aVcalculation,
p6
aVapplication,
p7
aVand last, and unfortunately least
p8
aVin terms of the time we give it,
p9
aVinspiration.
p10
aa(lp11
VMathematics is the science of patterns,
p12
aVand we study it to learn how to think logically,
p13
aVcritically and creatively,
p14
aVbut too much of the mathematics that we learn in school
p15
aVis not effectively motivated,
p16
aVand when our students ask,
p17
aV"Why are we learning this?"
p18
aVthen they often hear that they'll need it
p19
aVin an upcoming math class or on a future test.
p20
aVBut wouldn't it be great
p21
aVif every once in a while we did mathematics
p22
aVsimply because it was fun or beautiful
p23
aVor because it excited the mind?
p24
aVNow, I know many people have not
p25
aVhad the opportunity to see how this can happen,
p26
aVso let me give you a quick example
p27
aVwith my favorite collection of numbers,
p28
aVthe Fibonacci numbers. (Applause)
p29
aa(lp30
VYeah! I already have Fibonacci fans here.
p31
aVThat's great.
p32
aa(lp33
VNow these numbers can be appreciated
p34
aVin many different ways.
p35
aVFrom the standpoint of calculation,
p36
aVthey're as easy to understand
p37
aVas one plus one, which is two.
p38
aVThen one plus two is three,
p39
aVtwo plus three is five, three plus five is eight,
p40
aVand so on.
p41
aVIndeed, the person we call Fibonacci
p42
aVwas actually named Leonardo of Pisa,
p43
aVand these numbers appear in his book "Liber Abaci,"
p44
aVwhich taught the Western world
p45
aVthe methods of arithmetic that we use today.
p46
aVIn terms of applications,
p47
aVFibonacci numbers appear in nature
p48
aVsurprisingly often.
p49
aVThe number of petals on a flower
p50
aVis typically a Fibonacci number,
p51
aVor the number of spirals on a sunflower
p52
aVor a pineapple
p53
aVtends to be a Fibonacci number as well.
p54
aa(lp55
VIn fact, there are many more applications of Fibonacci numbers,
p56
aVbut what I find most inspirational about them
p57
aVare the beautiful number patterns they display.
p58
aVLet me show you one of my favorites.
p59
aVSuppose you like to square numbers,
p60
aVand frankly, who doesn't? (Laughter)
p61
aa(lp62
VLet's look at the squares
p63
aVof the first few Fibonacci numbers.
p64
aVSo one squared is one,
p65
aVtwo squared is four, three squared is nine,
p66
aVfive squared is 25, and so on.
p67
aVNow, it's no surprise
p68
aVthat when you add consecutive Fibonacci numbers,
p69
aVyou get the next Fibonacci number. Right?
p70
aVThat's how they're created.
p71
aVBut you wouldn't expect anything special
p72
aVto happen when you add the squares together.
p73
aVBut check this out.
p74
aVOne plus one gives us two,
p75
aVand one plus four gives us five.
p76
aVAnd four plus nine is 13,
p77
aVnine plus 25 is 34,
p78
aVand yes, the pattern continues.
p79
aa(lp80
VIn fact, here's another one.
p81
aVSuppose you wanted to look at
p82
aVadding the squares of the first few Fibonacci numbers.
p83
aVLet's see what we get there.
p84
aVSo one plus one plus four is six.
p85
aVAdd nine to that, we get 15.
p86
aVAdd 25, we get 40.
p87
aVAdd 64, we get 104.
p88
aVNow look at those numbers.
p89
aVThose are not Fibonacci numbers,
p90
aVbut if you look at them closely,
p91
aVyou'll see the Fibonacci numbers
p92
aVburied inside of them.
p93
aa(lp94
VDo you see it? I'll show it to you.
p95
aVSix is two times three, 15 is three times five,
p96
aV40 is five times eight,
p97
aVtwo, three, five, eight, who do we appreciate?
p98
aa(lp99
V(Laughter)
p100
aa(lp101
VFibonacci! Of course.
p102
aa(lp103
VNow, as much fun as it is to discover these patterns,
p104
aVit's even more satisfying to understand
p105
aVwhy they are true.
p106
aVLet's look at that last equation.
p107
aVWhy should the squares of one, one, two, three, five and eight
p108
aVadd up to eight times 13?
p109
aVI'll show you by drawing a simple picture.
p110
aVWe'll start with a one-by-one square
p111
aVand next to that put another one-by-one square.
p112
aVTogether, they form a one-by-two rectangle.
p113
aVBeneath that, I'll put a two-by-two square,
p114
aVand next to that, a three-by-three square,
p115
aVbeneath that, a five-by-five square,
p116
aVand then an eight-by-eight square,
p117
aVcreating one giant rectangle, right?
p118
aa(lp119
VNow let me ask you a simple question:
p120
aVwhat is the area of the rectangle?
p121
aVWell, on the one hand,
p122
aVit's the sum of the areas
p123
aVof the squares inside it, right?
p124
aVJust as we created it.
p125
aVIt's one squared plus one squared
p126
aVplus two squared plus three squared
p127
aVplus five squared plus eight squared. Right?
p128
aVThat's the area.
p129
aVOn the other hand, because it's a rectangle,
p130
aVthe area is equal to its height times its base,
p131
aVand the height is clearly eight,
p132
aVand the base is five plus eight,
p133
aVwhich is the next Fibonacci number, 13. Right?
p134
aVSo the area is also eight times 13.
p135
aVSince we've correctly calculated the area
p136
aVtwo different ways,
p137
aVthey have to be the same number,
p138
aVand that's why the squares of one, one, two, three, five and eight
p139
aVadd up to eight times 13.
p140
aa(lp141
VNow, if we continue this process,
p142
aVwe'll generate rectangles of the form 13 by 21,
p143
aV21 by 34, and so on.
p144
aa(lp145
VNow check this out.
p146
aVIf you divide 13 by eight,
p147
aVyou get 1.625.
p148
aVAnd if you divide the larger number by the smaller number,
p149
aVthen these ratios get closer and closer
p150
aVto about 1.618,
p151
aVknown to many people as the Golden Ratio,
p152
aVa number which has fascinated mathematicians,
p153
aVscientists and artists for centuries.
p154
aa(lp155
VNow, I show all this to you because,
p156
aVlike so much of mathematics,
p157
aVthere's a beautiful side to it
p158
aVthat I fear does not get enough attention
p159
aVin our schools.
p160
aVWe spend lots of time learning about calculation,
p161
aVbut let's not forget about application,
p162
aVincluding, perhaps, the most important application of all,
p163
aVlearning how to think.
p164
aa(lp165
VIf I could summarize this in one sentence,
p166
aVit would be this:
p167
aVMathematics is not just solving for x,
p168
aVit's also figuring out why.
p169
aa(lp170
VThank you very much.
