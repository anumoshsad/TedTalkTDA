VWe've been told to go out on a limb and say something surprising.
p4
aVSo I'll try and do that,
p5
aVbut I want to start with two things that everyone already knows.
p6
aVAnd the first one, in fact, is something that has been known
p7
aVfor most of recorded history,
p8
aVand that is, that the planet Earth, or the solar system,
p9
aVor our environment or whatever,
p10
aVis uniquely suited to sustain our evolution \u2014
p11
aVor creation, as it used to be thought \u2014
p12
aVand our present existence, and most important, our future survival.
p13
aa(lp14
VNowadays, this idea has a dramatic name: Spaceship Earth.
p15
aVAnd the idea there is that outside the spaceship,
p16
aVthe universe is implacably hostile,
p17
aVand inside is all we have, all we depend on,
p18
aVand we only get the one chance: if we mess up our spaceship,
p19
aVwe've got nowhere else to go.
p20
aVNow, the second thing that everyone already knows
p21
aVis that, contrary to what was believed for most of human history,
p22
aVhuman beings are not, in fact, the hub of existence.
p23
aVAs Stephen Hawking famously said,
p24
aVwe're just a chemical scum on the surface of a typical planet
p25
aVthat's in orbit around a typical star,
p26
aVwhich is on the outskirts of a typical galaxy, and so on.
p27
aa(lp28
VNow, the first of those two things that everyone knows is kind of saying
p29
aVthat we're at a very un-typical place, uniquely suited and so on,
p30
aVand the second one is saying that we're at a typical place.
p31
aVAnd, especially if you regard these two as deep truths to live by
p32
aVand to inform your life decisions,
p33
aVthen they seem a little bit to conflict with each other.
p34
aVBut that doesn't prevent them from both being completely false.
p35
aa(lp36
V(Laughter)
p37
aa(lp38
VAnd they are.
p39
aVSo let me start with the second one:
p40
aV"Typical." Well, is this a typical place?
p41
aVWell, let's look around, you know, look in a random direction,
p42
aVand we see a wall, and chemical scum \u2014
p43
aa(lp44
V(Laughter)
p45
aa(lp46
Vand that's not typical of the universe at all.
p47
aVAll you've got to do is go a few hundred miles in that same direction
p48
aVand look back,
p49
aVand you won't see any walls or chemical scum at all \u2014
p50
aVall you see is a blue planet.
p51
aVAnd if you go further than that,
p52
aVyou'll see the Sun, the solar system and the stars and so on,
p53
aVbut that's still not typical of the universe,
p54
aVbecause stars come in galaxies.
p55
aVAnd most places in the universe, a typical place in the universe,
p56
aVis nowhere near any galaxies.
p57
aa(lp58
VSo let's go out further, till we're outside the galaxy, and look back,
p59
aVand yeah, there's the huge galaxy with spiral arms laid out in front of us.
p60
aVAnd at this point, we've come 100,000 light-years from here.
p61
aVBut we're still nowhere near a typical place in the universe.
p62
aVTo get to a typical place,
p63
aVyou've got to go 1,000 times as far as that,
p64
aVinto intergalactic space.
p65
aVAnd so, what does that look like \u2014 "typical?"
p66
aVWhat does a "typical" place in the universe look like?
p67
aVWell, at enormous expense, TED has arranged
p68
aVa high-resolution immersion virtual reality rendering
p69
aVof the view from intergalactic space.
p70
aVCan we have the lights off, please, so we can see it?
p71
aa(lp72
VWell, not quite, not quite perfect.
p73
aa(lp74
VYou see, intergalactic space is completely dark, pitch dark.
p75
aVIt's so dark,
p76
aVthat if you were to be looking at the nearest star to you,
p77
aVand that star were to explode as a supernova,
p78
aVand you were to be staring directly at it at the moment when its light reached you,
p79
aVyou still wouldn't be able to see even a glimmer.
p80
aVThat's how big and how dark the universe is.
p81
aVAnd that's despite the fact that a supernova is so bright,
p82
aVso brilliant an event,
p83
aVthat it would kill you stone dead at a range of several light-years.
p84
aa(lp85
V(Laughter)
p86
aa(lp87
VAnd yet, from intergalactic space,
p88
aVit's so far away you wouldn't even see it.
p89
aVIt's also very cold out there \u2014
p90
aVless than three degrees above absolute zero.
p91
aVAnd it's very empty.
p92
aVThe vacuum there is one million times less dense than the highest vacuum
p93
aVthat our best technology on Earth can currently create.
p94
aVSo that's how different a typical place is from this place.
p95
aVAnd that is how un-typical this place is.
p96
aVSo can we have the lights back on please? Thank you.
p97
aa(lp98
VNow, how do we know about an environment that's so far away and so different
p99
aVand so alien from anything we're used to?
p100
aVWell, the Earth \u2014 our environment, in the form of us \u2014
p101
aVis creating knowledge.
p102
aVWell, what does that mean?
p103
aVWell, look out even further than we've just been \u2014
p104
aVI mean from here, with a telescope \u2014
p105
aVand you'll see things that look like stars, they're called quasars.
p106
aV"Quasars" originally meant "quasi-stellar object,"
p107
aVwhich means "things that look a bit like stars."
p108
aa(lp109
V(Laughter)
p110
aa(lp111
VBut they're not stars.
p112
aVAnd we know what they are.
p113
aVBillions of years ago and billions of light-years away,
p114
aVthe material at the center of a galaxy collapsed
p115
aVtowards a super-massive black hole.
p116
aVAnd then intense magnetic fields
p117
aVdirected some of the energy of that gravitational collapse
p118
aVand some of the matter
p119
aVback out in the form of tremendous jets,
p120
aVwhich illuminated lobes
p121
aVwith the brilliance of \u2014 I think it's a trillion \u2014 suns.
p122
aa(lp123
VNow, the physics of the human brain could hardly be more unlike
p124
aVthe physics of such a jet.
p125
aVWe couldn't survive for an instant in it.
p126
aVLanguage breaks down when trying to describe
p127
aVwhat it would be like in one of those jets.
p128
aVIt would be a bit like experiencing a supernova explosion,
p129
aVbut at point-blank range and for millions of years at a time.
p130
aa(lp131
V(Laughter)
p132
aa(lp133
VAnd yet, that jet happened in precisely such a way
p134
aVthat billions of years later, on the other side of the universe,
p135
aVsome bit of chemical scum could accurately describe
p136
aVand model and predict and explain, above all \u2014
p137
aVthere's your reference \u2014
p138
aVwhat was happening there, in reality.
p139
aVThe one physical system, the brain, contains an accurate working model
p140
aVof the other, the quasar.
p141
aVNot just a superficial image of it, though it contains that as well,
p142
aVbut an explanatory model,
p143
aVembodying the same mathematical relationships
p144
aVand the same causal structure.
p145
aa(lp146
VNow, that is knowledge.
p147
aVAnd if that weren't amazing enough,
p148
aVthe faithfulness with which the one structure resembles the other
p149
aVis increasing with time.
p150
aVThat is the growth of knowledge.
p151
aVSo, the laws of physics have this special property,
p152
aVthat physical objects as unlike each other as they could possibly be,
p153
aVcan nevertheless embody the same mathematical and causal structure
p154
aVand to do it more and more so over time.
p155
aa(lp156
VSo we are a chemical scum that is different.
p157
aVThis chemical scum has universality.
p158
aVIts structure contains, with ever-increasing precision,
p159
aVthe structure of everything.
p160
aVThis place, and not other places in the universe,
p161
aVis a hub which contains within itself the structural and causal essence
p162
aVof the whole of the rest of physical reality.
p163
aVAnd so, far from being insignificant,
p164
aVthe fact that the laws of physics allow this
p165
aVor even mandate that this can happen,
p166
aVis one of the most important things about the physical world.
p167
aa(lp168
VNow how does the solar system \u2014 our environment, in the form of us \u2014
p169
aVacquire this special relationship with the rest of the universe?
p170
aVWell, one thing that's true about Stephen Hawking's remark \u2014
p171
aVI mean, it is true, but it's the wrong emphasis.
p172
aVOne thing that's true about it is that it doesn't do it with any special physics,
p173
aVthere's no special dispensation, no miracles involved.
p174
aVIt does it simply with three things that we have here in abundance.
p175
aVOne of them is matter,
p176
aVbecause the growth of knowledge is a form of information processing.
p177
aVInformation processing is computation, computation requires a computer \u2014
p178
aVthere's no known way of making a computer without matter.
p179
aVWe also need energy to make the computer, and most important,
p180
aVto make the media, in effect, onto which we record
p181
aVthe knowledge that we discover.
p182
aa(lp183
VAnd then thirdly, less tangible but just as essential
p184
aVfor the open-ended creation of knowledge, of explanations,
p185
aVis evidence.
p186
aVNow, our environment is inundated with evidence.
p187
aVWe happen to get round to testing, let's say, Newton's Law of Gravity,
p188
aVabout 300 years ago.
p189
aVBut the evidence that we used to do that
p190
aVwas falling down on every square meter of the Earth
p191
aVfor billions of years before that,
p192
aVand will continue to fall for billions of years afterwards.
p193
aVAnd the same is true for all the other sciences.
p194
aVAs far as we know, evidence to discover the most fundamental truths
p195
aVof all the sciences is here just for the taking, on our planet.
p196
aa(lp197
VOur location is saturated with evidence
p198
aVand also with matter and energy.
p199
aVOut in intergalactic space,
p200
aVthose three prerequisites for the open-ended creation of knowledge
p201
aVare at their lowest possible supply \u2014
p202
aVas I said, it's empty, it's cold and it's dark out there.
p203
aVOr is it?
p204
aVNow actually, that's just another parochial misconception.
p205
aa(lp206
V(Laughter)
p207
aa(lp208
VBecause imagine a cube out there in intergalactic space,
p209
aVthe same size as our home, the solar system.
p210
aVNow that cube is very empty by human standards,
p211
aVbut that still means that it contains over a million tons of matter.
p212
aVAnd a million tons is enough to make, say, a self-contained space station,
p213
aVon which there's a colony of scientists
p214
aVthat are devoted to creating an open-ended stream of knowledge, and so on.
p215
aa(lp216
VNow, it's way beyond present technology
p217
aVto even gather the hydrogen from intergalactic space
p218
aVand form it into other elements and so on.
p219
aVBut the thing is, in a comprehensible universe,
p220
aVif something isn't forbidden by the laws of physics,
p221
aVthen what could possibly prevent us from doing it, other than knowing how?
p222
aVIn other words, it's a matter of knowledge, not resources.
p223
aVIf we could do that, we'd automatically have an energy supply,
p224
aVbecause this transmutation would be a fusion reactor.
p225
aa(lp226
VAnd evidence?
p227
aVWell, again, it's dark out there to human senses,
p228
aVbut all you've got to do is take a telescope,
p229
aVeven one of present-day design,
p230
aVlook out, and you'll see the same galaxies as we do from here.
p231
aVAnd with a more powerful telescope,
p232
aVyou'll be able to see stars and planets in those galaxies,
p233
aVyou'll be able to do astrophysics and learn the laws of physics.
p234
aVAnd locally there you could build particle accelerators,
p235
aVand learn elementary particle physics and chemistry, and so on.
p236
aVProbably the hardest science to do would be biology field trips \u2014
p237
aa(lp238
V(Laughter)
p239
aa(lp240
Vbecause it would take several hundred million years
p241
aVto get to the nearest life-bearing planet and back.
p242
aVBut I have to tell you \u2014 and sorry, Richard \u2014
p243
aVbut I never did like biology field trips much,
p244
aa(lp245
V(Laughter)
p246
aa(lp247
Vand I think we can just about make do
p248
aVwith one every few hundred million years.
p249
aa(lp250
V(Laughter)
p251
aa(lp252
VSo in fact, intergalactic space does contain all the prerequisites
p253
aVfor the open-ended creation of knowledge.
p254
aVAny such cube anywhere in the universe
p255
aVcould become the same kind of hub that we are,
p256
aVif the knowledge of how to do so were present there.
p257
aVSo, we're not in a uniquely hospitable place.
p258
aVIf intergalactic space is capable of creating
p259
aVan open-ended stream of explanations,
p260
aVthen so is almost every other environment,
p261
aVso is the Earth.
p262
aVSo is a polluted Earth.
p263
aVAnd the limiting factor, there and here,
p264
aVis not resources, because they're plentiful,
p265
aVbut knowledge, which is scarce.
p266
aa(lp267
VNow this cosmic knowledge-based view may \u2014 and I think ought to \u2014
p268
aVmake us feel very special.
p269
aVBut it should also make us feel vulnerable,
p270
aVbecause it means that without the specific knowledge
p271
aVthat's needed to survive the ongoing challenges of the universe,
p272
aVwe won't survive them.
p273
aVAll it takes is for a supernova to go off a few light-years away,
p274
aVand we'll all be dead!
p275
aa(lp276
VMartin Rees has recently written a book
p277
aVabout our vulnerability to all sorts of things,
p278
aVfrom astrophysics, to scientific experiments gone wrong,
p279
aVand most importantly, to terrorism with weapons of mass destruction.
p280
aVAnd he thinks that civilization has only a 50 percent chance
p281
aVof surviving this century.
p282
aVI think he's going to talk about that later in the conference.
p283
aa(lp284
VNow, I don't think that probability is the right category
p285
aVto discuss this issue in,
p286
aVbut I do agree with him about this:
p287
aVWe can survive and we can fail to survive.
p288
aVBut it depends not on chance,
p289
aVbut on whether we create the relevant knowledge in time.
p290
aVThe danger is not at all unprecedented.
p291
aVSpecies go extinct all the time.
p292
aVCivilizations end.
p293
aVThe overwhelming majority of all species and all civilizations
p294
aVthat have ever existed are now history.
p295
aVAnd if we want to be the exception to that,
p296
aVthen logically, our only hope is to make use of the one feature
p297
aVthat distinguishes our species and civilization from all the others \u2014
p298
aVnamely, our special relationship with the laws of physics,
p299
aVour ability to create new explanations, new knowledge \u2014
p300
aVto be a hub of existence.
p301
aa(lp302
VSo let me now apply this to a current controversy,
p303
aVnot because I want to advocate any particular solution,
p304
aVbut just to illustrate the kind of thing I mean.
p305
aVAnd the controversy is global warming.
p306
aVNow, I'm a physicist, but I'm not the right kind of physicist.
p307
aVIn regard to global warming, I'm just a layman.
p308
aVAnd the rational thing for a layman to do
p309
aVis to take seriously the prevailing scientific theory.
p310
aVAnd according to that theory, it's already too late to avoid a disaster,
p311
aVbecause if it's true that our best option at the moment is to prevent CO2 emissions
p312
aVwith something like the Kyoto Protocol,
p313
aVwith its constraints on economic activity and its enormous cost
p314
aVof hundreds of billions of dollars, or whatever it is,
p315
aVthen that is already a disaster by any reasonable measure.
p316
aVAnd the actions that are advocated are not even purported to solve the problem,
p317
aVmerely to postpone it by a little.
p318
aVSo it's already too late to avoid it,
p319
aVand it probably has been too late to avoid it
p320
aVever since before anyone realized the danger.
p321
aVIt was probably already too late in the 1970s,
p322
aVwhen the best available scientific theory was telling us
p323
aVthat industrial emissions were about to precipitate a new ice age,
p324
aVin which billions would die.
p325
aa(lp326
VNow, the lesson of that seems clear to me,
p327
aVand I don't know why it isn't informing public debate.
p328
aVIt is that we can't always know.
p329
aVWhen we know of an impending disaster,
p330
aVand how to solve it at a cost less than the cost of the disaster itself,
p331
aVthen there's not going to be much argument, really.
p332
aVBut no precautions and no precautionary principle
p333
aVcan avoid problems that we do not yet foresee.
p334
aa(lp335
VHence, we need a stance of problem-fixing,
p336
aVnot just problem-avoidance.
p337
aVAnd it's true that an ounce of prevention equals a pound of cure,
p338
aVbut that's only if we know what to prevent.
p339
aVIf you've been punched on the nose,
p340
aVthen the science of medicine does not consist of teaching you
p341
aVhow to avoid punches.
p342
aa(lp343
V(Laughter)
p344
aa(lp345
VIf medical science stopped seeking cures and concentrated on prevention only,
p346
aVthen it would achieve very little of either.
p347
aa(lp348
VThe world is buzzing at the moment
p349
aVwith plans to force reductions in gas emissions at all costs.
p350
aVIt ought to be buzzing with plans to reduce the temperature,
p351
aVand with plans to live at the higher temperature \u2014
p352
aVand not at all costs, but efficiently and cheaply.
p353
aVAnd some such plans exist,
p354
aVthings like swarms of mirrors in space to deflect the sunlight away,
p355
aVand encouraging aquatic organisms to eat more carbon dioxide.
p356
aVAt the moment, these things are fringe research;
p357
aVthey're not central to the human effort to face this problem,
p358
aVor problems in general.
p359
aVAnd with problems that we are not aware of yet,
p360
aVthe ability to put right \u2014 not the sheer good luck of avoiding indefinitely \u2014
p361
aVis our only hope, not just of solving problems,
p362
aVbut of survival.
p363
aa(lp364
VSo take two stone tablets, and carve on them.
p365
aVOn one of them, carve: "Problems are soluble."
p366
aVAnd on the other one, carve: "Problems are inevitable."
