VI was in New York during Hurricane Sandy,
p4
aVand this little white dog called Maui
p5
aVwas staying with me.
p6
aVHalf the city was dark because of a power cut,
p7
aVand I was living on the dark side.
p8
aVNow, Maui was terrified of the dark,
p9
aVso I had to carry him up the stairs,
p10
aVactually down the stairs first, for his walk,
p11
aVand then bring him back up.
p12
aVI was also hauling gallons of bottles of water
p13
aVup to the seventh floor every day.
p14
aVAnd through all of this,
p15
aVI had to hold a torch between my teeth.
p16
aVThe stores nearby were out of flashlights
p17
aVand batteries and bread.
p18
aVFor a shower, I walked 40 blocks
p19
aVto a branch of my gym.
p20
aa(lp21
VBut these were not the major preoccupations of my day.
p22
aVIt was just as critical for me to be the first person in
p23
aVat a cafe nearby with extension cords and chargers
p24
aVto juice my multiple devices.
p25
aVI started to prospect under the benches of bakeries
p26
aVand the entrances of pastry shops for plug points.
p27
aVI wasn't the only one.
p28
aVEven in the rain, people stood between Madison and 5th Avenue
p29
aVunder their umbrellas charging their cell phones
p30
aVfrom outlets on the street.
p31
aVNature had just reminded us
p32
aVthat it was stronger than all our technology,
p33
aVand yet here we were, obsessed about being wired.
p34
aa(lp35
VI think there's nothing like a crisis
p36
aVto tell you what's really important and what's not,
p37
aVand Sandy made me realize that our devices
p38
aVand their connectivity matter to us
p39
aVright up there with food and shelter.
p40
aVThe self as we once knew it no longer exists,
p41
aVand I think that an abstract, digital universe
p42
aVhas become a part of our identity,
p43
aVand I want to talk to you about what I think that means.
p44
aa(lp45
VI'm a novelist, and I'm interested in the self
p46
aVbecause the self and fiction have a lot in common.
p47
aVThey're both stories, interpretations.
p48
aVYou and I can experience things without a story.
p49
aVWe might run up the stairs too quickly
p50
aVand we might get breathless.
p51
aVBut the larger sense that we have of our lives,
p52
aVthe slightly more abstract one, is indirect.
p53
aVOur story of our life is based on direct experience,
p54
aVbut it's embellished.
p55
aVA novel needs scene after scene to build,
p56
aVand the story of our life needs an arc as well.
p57
aVIt needs months and years.
p58
aVDiscrete moments from our lives are its chapters.
p59
aVBut the story is not about these chapters.
p60
aVIt's the whole book.
p61
aVIt's not only about the heartbreak and the happiness,
p62
aVthe victories and the disappointments,
p63
aVbut it's because how because of these,
p64
aVand sometimes, more importantly, in spite of these,
p65
aVwe find our place in the world
p66
aVand we change it and we change ourselves.
p67
aVOur story, therefore, needs two dimensions of time:
p68
aVa long arc of time that is our lifespan,
p69
aVand the timeframe of direct experience
p70
aVthat is the moment.
p71
aVNow the self that experiences directly
p72
aVcan only exist in the moment,
p73
aVbut the one that narrates needs several moments,
p74
aVa whole sequence of them,
p75
aVand that's why our full sense of self
p76
aVneeds both immersive experience
p77
aVand the flow of time.
p78
aVNow, the flow of time is embedded in everything,
p79
aVin the erosion of a grain of sand,
p80
aVin the budding of a little bud into a rose.
p81
aVWithout it, we would have no music.
p82
aVOur own emotions and state of mind
p83
aVoften encode time,
p84
aVregret or nostalgia about the past,
p85
aVhope or dread about the future.
p86
aa(lp87
VI think that technology has altered that flow of time.
p88
aVThe overall time that we have for our narrative,
p89
aVour lifespan, has been increasing,
p90
aVbut the smallest measure, the moment, has shrunk.
p91
aVIt has shrunk because our instruments enable us
p92
aVin part to measure smaller and smaller units of time,
p93
aVand this in turn has given us a more granular understanding
p94
aVof the material world,
p95
aVand this granular understanding
p96
aVhas generated reams of data
p97
aVthat our brains can no longer comprehend
p98
aVand for which we need more and more complicated computers.
p99
aVAll of this to say that the gap
p100
aVbetween what we can perceive and what we can measure
p101
aVis only going to widen.
p102
aVScience can do things with and in a picosecond,
p103
aVbut you and I are never going to have the inner experience
p104
aVof a millionth of a millionth of a second.
p105
aVYou and I answer only to nature's rhythm and flow,
p106
aVto the sun, the moon and the seasons,
p107
aVand this is why we need that long arc of time
p108
aVwith the past, the present and the future
p109
aVto see things for what they are,
p110
aVto separate signal from noise
p111
aVand the self from sensations.
p112
aVWe need time's arrow to understand cause and effect,
p113
aVnot just in the material world,
p114
aVbut in our own intentions and our motivations.
p115
aVWhat happens when that arrow goes awry?
p116
aVWhat happens when time warps?
p117
aa(lp118
VSo many of us today have the sensation
p119
aVthat time's arrow is pointing everywhere
p120
aVand nowhere at once.
p121
aVThis is because time doesn't flow in the digital world
p122
aVin the same way that it does in the natural one.
p123
aVWe all know that the Internet has shrunk space
p124
aVas well as time.
p125
aVFar away over there is now here.
p126
aVNews from India is a stream on my smartphone app
p127
aVwhether I'm in New York or New Delhi.
p128
aVAnd that's not all.
p129
aVYour last job, your dinner reservations from last year,
p130
aVyour former friends, lie on a flat plain with today's friends,
p131
aVbecause the Internet also archives,
p132
aVand it warps the past.
p133
aVWith no distinction left between the past,
p134
aVthe present and the future, and the here or there,
p135
aVwe are left with this moment everywhere,
p136
aVthis moment that I'll call the digital now.
p137
aa(lp138
VJust how can we prioritize
p139
aVin the landscape of the digital now?
p140
aVThis digital now is not the present,
p141
aVbecause it's always a few seconds ahead,
p142
aVwith Twitter streams that are already trending
p143
aVand news from other time zones.
p144
aVThis isn't the now of a shooting pain in your foot
p145
aVor the second that you bite into a pastry
p146
aVor the three hours that you lose yourself in a great book.
p147
aVThis now bears very little physical
p148
aVor psychological reference to our own state.
p149
aVIts focus, instead, is to distract us
p150
aVat every turn on the road.
p151
aVEvery digital landmark is an invitation
p152
aVto leave what you are doing now to go somewhere else
p153
aVand do something else.
p154
aVAre you reading an interview by an author?
p155
aVWhy not buy his book? Tweet it. Share it.
p156
aVLike it. Find other books exactly like his.
p157
aVFind other people reading those books.
p158
aVTravel can be liberating,
p159
aVbut when it is incessant, we become
p160
aVpermanent exiles without repose.
p161
aVChoice is freedom, but not when it's constantly
p162
aVfor its own sake.
p163
aa(lp164
VNot just is the digital now far from the present,
p165
aVbut it's in direct competition with it,
p166
aVand this is because not just am I absent from it,
p167
aVbut so are you.
p168
aVNot just are we absent from it, but so is everyone else.
p169
aVAnd therein lies its greatest convenience and horror.
p170
aVI can order foreign language books in the middle of the night,
p171
aVshop for Parisian macarons,
p172
aVand leave video messages that get picked up later.
p173
aVAt all times, I can operate
p174
aVat a different rhythm and pace from you,
p175
aVwhile I sustain the illusion
p176
aVthat I'm tapped into you in real time.
p177
aa(lp178
VSandy was a reminder
p179
aVof how such an illusion can shatter.
p180
aVThere were those with power and water,
p181
aVand those without.
p182
aVThere are those who went back to their lives,
p183
aVand those who are still displaced
p184
aVafter so many months.
p185
aVFor some reason, technology seems to perpetuate
p186
aVthe illusion for those who have it that everyone does,
p187
aVand then, like an ironic slap in the face,
p188
aVit makes it true.
p189
aVFor example, it's said that there are more people
p190
aVin India with access to cell phones than toilets.
p191
aVNow if this rift, which is already so great
p192
aVin many parts of the world,
p193
aVbetween the lack of infrastructure and the spread of technology,
p194
aVisn't somehow bridged,
p195
aVthere will be ruptures between the digital
p196
aVand the real.
p197
aVFor us as individuals who live in the digital now
p198
aVand spend most of our waking moments in it,
p199
aVthe challenge is to live in two streams of time
p200
aVthat are parallel and almost simultaneous.
p201
aVHow does one live inside distraction?
p202
aa(lp203
VWe might think that those younger than us,
p204
aVthose who are born into this, will adapt more naturally.
p205
aVPossibly, but I remember my childhood.
p206
aVI remember my grandfather revising
p207
aVthe capitals of the world with me.
p208
aVBuda and Pest were separated by the Danube,
p209
aVand Vienna had a Spanish riding school.
p210
aVIf I were a child today, I could easily learn this information
p211
aVwith apps and hyperlinks,
p212
aVbut it really wouldn't be the same,
p213
aVbecause much later, I went to Vienna,
p214
aVand I went to the Spanish riding school,
p215
aVand I could feel my grandfather right beside me.
p216
aVNight after night, he took me up on the terrace,
p217
aVon his shoulders, and pointed out Jupiter
p218
aVand Saturn and the Great Bear to me.
p219
aVAnd even here, when I look at the Great Bear,
p220
aVI get back that feeling of being a child,
p221
aVhanging onto his head and trying to balance myself
p222
aVon his shoulder,
p223
aVand I can get back that feeling of being a child again.
p224
aVWhat I had with my grandfather was wrapped
p225
aVso often in information and knowledge and fact,
p226
aVbut it was about so much more
p227
aVthan information or knowledge or fact.
p228
aVTime-warping technology challenges
p229
aVour deepest core,
p230
aVbecause we are able to archive the past
p231
aVand some of it becomes hard to forget,
p232
aVeven as the current moment
p233
aVis increasingly unmemorable.
p234
aVWe want to clutch, and we are left instead
p235
aVclutching at a series of static moments.
p236
aVThey're like soap bubbles that disappear when we touch them.
p237
aa(lp238
VBy archiving everything, we think that we can store it,
p239
aVbut time is not data.
p240
aVIt cannot be stored.
p241
aVYou and I know exactly what it means like
p242
aVto be truly present in a moment.
p243
aVIt might have happened while we were
p244
aVplaying an instrument,
p245
aVor looking into the eyes of someone we've known
p246
aVfor a very long time.
p247
aVAt such moments, our selves are complete.
p248
aVThe self that lives in the long narrative arc
p249
aVand the self that experiences the moment
p250
aVbecome one.
p251
aVThe present encapsulates the past
p252
aVand a promise for the future.
p253
aVThe present joins a flow of time
p254
aVfrom before and after.
p255
aa(lp256
VI first experienced these feelings with my grandmother.
p257
aVI wanted to learn to skip, and she found an old rope
p258
aVand she tucked up her sari
p259
aVand she jumped over it.
p260
aVI wanted to learn to cook, and she kept me in the kitchen,
p261
aVcutting, cubing and chopping for a whole month.
p262
aVMy grandmother taught me that things happen
p263
aVin the time they take, that time can't be fought,
p264
aVand because it will pass and it will move,
p265
aVwe owe the present moment our full attention.
p266
aVAttention is time.
p267
aVOne of my yoga instructors once said
p268
aVthat love is attention,
p269
aVand definitely from my grandmother,
p270
aVlove and attention were one and the same thing.
p271
aVThe digital world cannibalizes time,
p272
aVand in doing so, I want to suggest
p273
aVthat what it threatens
p274
aVis the completeness of ourselves.
p275
aVIt threatens the flow of love.
p276
aVBut we don't need to let it.
p277
aVWe can choose otherwise.
p278
aVWe've seen again and again
p279
aVjust how creative technology can be,
p280
aVand in our lives and in our actions,
p281
aVwe can choose those solutions and those innovations
p282
aVand those moments that restore the flow of time
p283
aVinstead of fragmenting it.
p284
aVWe can slow down and we can tune in
p285
aVto the ebb and flow of time.
p286
aVWe can choose to take time back.
p287
