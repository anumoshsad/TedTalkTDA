aV["The Long Reach of Reason"]
p6
aVCabbie: Twenty-two dollars. Steven Pinker: Okay.
p7
aVRebecca Newberger Goldstein: Reason  appears to have fallen on hard times:
p8
aVPopular culture plumbs new depths of dumbth
p9
aVand political discourse has become a race
p10
aVto the bottom.
p11
aVWe're living in an era of scientific creationism,
p12
aV9/11 conspiracy theories, psychic hotlines,
p13
aVand a resurgence of religious fundamentalism.
p14
aVPeople who think too well
p15
aVare often accused of elitism,
p16
aVand even in the academy,
p17
aVthere are attacks on logocentrism,
p18
aVthe crime of letting logic dominate our thinking.
p19
aa(lp20
VSP: But is this necessarily a bad thing?
p21
aVPerhaps reason is overrated.
p22
aVMany pundits have argued that a good heart
p23
aVand steadfast moral clarity
p24
aVare superior to triangulations of overeducated policy wonks,
p25
aVlike the best and brightest and that dragged us
p26
aVinto the quagmire of Vietnam.
p27
aVAnd wasn't it reason that gave us the means
p28
aVto despoil the planet
p29
aVand threaten our species with weapons of mass destruction?
p30
aVIn this way of thinking,  it's character and conscience,
p31
aVnot cold-hearted calculation, that will save us.
p32
aVBesides, a human being is not a brain on a stick.
p33
aVMy fellow psychologists have shown that we're led
p34
aVby our bodies and our emotions
p35
aVand use our puny powers of reason
p36
aVmerely to rationalize our gut feelings after the fact.
p37
aa(lp38
VRNG: How could a reasoned argument logically entail
p39
aVthe ineffectiveness of reasoned arguments?
p40
aVLook, you're trying to persuade us of reason's impotence.
p41
aVYou're not threatening us or bribing us,
p42
aVsuggesting that we resolve the issue
p43
aVwith a show of hands or a beauty contest.
p44
aVBy the very act of trying to reason us into your position,
p45
aVyou're conceding reason's potency.
p46
aVReason isn't up for grabs here. It can't be.
p47
aVYou show up for that debate
p48
aVand you've already lost it.
p49
aa(lp50
VSP: But can reason lead us in directions
p51
aVthat are good or decent or moral?
p52
aVAfter all, you pointed out that reason
p53
aVis just a means to an end,
p54
aVand the end depends on the reasoner's passions.
p55
aVReason can lay out a road map to peace and harmony
p56
aVif the reasoner wants peace and harmony,
p57
aVbut it can also lay out a road map to conflict and strife
p58
aVif the reasoner delights in conflict and strife.
p59
aVCan reason force the reasoner to want
p60
aVless cruelty and waste?
p61
aa(lp62
VRNG: All on its own, the answer is no,
p63
aVbut it doesn't take much to switch it to yes.
p64
aVYou need two conditions:
p65
aVThe first is that reasoners all care
p66
aVabout their own well-being.
p67
aVThat's one of the passions that has to be present
p68
aVin order for reason to go to work,
p69
aVand it's obviously present in all of us.
p70
aVWe all care passionately
p71
aVabout our own well-being.
p72
aVThe second condition is that reasoners
p73
aVare members of a community of reasoners
p74
aVwho can affect one another's well-being,
p75
aVcan exchange messages,
p76
aVand comprehend each other's reasoning.
p77
aVAnd that's certainly true of our gregarious
p78
aVand loquatious species,
p79
aVwell endowed with the instinct for language.
p80
aa(lp81
VSP: Well, that sounds good in theory,
p82
aVbut has it worked that way in practice?
p83
aVIn particular, can it explain
p84
aVa momentous historical development
p85
aVthat I spoke about five years ago here at TED?
p86
aVNamely, we seem to be getting more humane.
p87
aVCenturies ago, our ancestors would burn cats alive
p88
aVas a form of popular entertainment.
p89
aVKnights waged constant war on each other
p90
aVby trying to kill as many of each other's peasants as possible.
p91
aVGovernments executed people for frivolous reasons,
p92
aVlike stealing a cabbage
p93
aVor criticizing the royal garden.
p94
aVThe executions were designed to be as prolonged
p95
aVand as painful as possible, like crucifixion,
p96
aVdisembowelment, breaking on the wheel.
p97
aVRespectable people kept slaves.
p98
aVFor all our flaws, we have abandoned
p99
aVthese barbaric practices.
p100
aa(lp101
VRNG: So, do you think it's human nature that's changed?
p102
aa(lp103
VSP: Not exactly. I think we still harbor instincts
p104
aVthat can erupt in violence,
p105
aVlike greed, tribalism, revenge, dominance, sadism.
p106
aVBut we also have instincts that can steer us away,
p107
aVlike self-control, empathy, a sense of fairness,
p108
aVwhat Abraham Lincoln called
p109
aVthe better angels of our nature.
p110
aa(lp111
VRNG: So if human nature didn't change,
p112
aVwhat invigorated those better angels?
p113
aa(lp114
VSP: Well, among other things,
p115
aVour circle of empathy expanded.
p116
aVYears ago, our ancestors would feel the pain
p117
aVonly of their family and people in their village.
p118
aVBut with the expansion of literacy and travel,
p119
aVpeople started to sympathize
p120
aVwith wider and wider circles,
p121
aVthe clan, the tribe, the nation, the race,
p122
aVand perhaps eventually, all of humanity.
p123
aa(lp124
VRNG: Can hard-headed scientists
p125
aVreally give so much credit to soft-hearted empathy?
p126
aa(lp127
VSP: They can and do.
p128
aVNeurophysiologists have found neurons in the brain
p129
aVthat respond to other people's actions
p130
aVthe same way they respond to our own.
p131
aVEmpathy emerges early in life,
p132
aVperhaps before the age of one.
p133
aVBooks on empathy have become bestsellers,
p134
aVlike "The Empathic Civilization"
p135
aVand "The Age of Empathy."
p136
aa(lp137
VRNG: I'm all for empathy. I mean, who isn't?
p138
aVBut all on its own, it's a feeble instrument
p139
aVfor making moral progress.
p140
aVFor one thing, it's innately biased
p141
aVtoward blood relations, babies
p142
aVand warm, fuzzy animals.
p143
aVAs far as empathy is concerned,
p144
aVugly outsiders can go to hell.
p145
aVAnd even our best attempts to work up sympathy
p146
aVfor those who are unconnected with us
p147
aVfall miserably short, a sad truth about human nature
p148
aVthat was pointed out by Adam Smith.
p149
aa(lp150
VAdam Smith: Let us suppose that the great empire
p151
aVof China was suddenly swallowed up by an earthquake,
p152
aVand let us consider how a  man of humanity in Europe
p153
aVwould react on receiving intelligence
p154
aVof this dreadful calamity.
p155
aVHe would, I imagine, first of all express very strongly
p156
aVhis sorrow for the misfortune of that unhappy people.
p157
aVHe would make many melancholy reflections
p158
aVupon the precariousness of human life,
p159
aVand when all these humane sentiments
p160
aVhad been once fairly expressed,
p161
aVhe would pursue his business or his pleasure
p162
aVwith the same ease and tranquility
p163
aVas if no such accident had happened.
p164
aVIf he was to lose his little finger tomorrow,
p165
aVhe would not sleep tonight,
p166
aVbut provided he never saw them,
p167
aVhe would snore with the most profound security
p168
aVover the ruin of a hundred million of his brethren.
p169
aa(lp170
VSP: But if empathy wasn't enough to make us more humane,
p171
aVwhat else was there?
p172
aa(lp173
VRNG: Well, you didn't mention what might be
p174
aVone of our most effective better angels: reason.
p175
aVReason has muscle.
p176
aVIt's reason that provides the push to widen
p177
aVthat circle of empathy.
p178
aVEvery one of the humanitarian developments
p179
aVthat you mentioned originated with thinkers
p180
aVwho gave reasons for why some practice
p181
aVwas indefensible.
p182
aVThey demonstrated that the way people treated
p183
aVsome particular group of others
p184
aVwas logically inconsistent
p185
aVwith the way they insisted on being treated themselves.
p186
aa(lp187
VSP: Are you saying that reason
p188
aVcan actually change people's minds?
p189
aVDon't people just stick with whatever conviction
p190
aVserves their interests
p191
aVor conforms to the culture that they grew up in?
p192
aa(lp193
VRNG: Here's a fascinating fact about us:
p194
aVContradictions bother us,
p195
aVat least when we're forced to confront them,
p196
aVwhich is just another way of saying
p197
aVthat we are susceptible to reason.
p198
aVAnd if you look at the history of moral progress,
p199
aVyou can trace a direct pathway from reasoned arguments
p200
aVto changes in the way that we actually feel.
p201
aVTime and again, a thinker would lay out an argument
p202
aVas to why some practice was indefensible,
p203
aVirrational, inconsistent with values already held.
p204
aVTheir essay would go viral,
p205
aVget translated into many languages,
p206
aVget debated at pubs and coffee houses and salons,
p207
aVand at dinner parties,
p208
aVand influence leaders, legislators,
p209
aVpopular opinion.
p210
aVEventually their conclusions get absorbed
p211
aVinto the common sense of decency,
p212
aVerasing the tracks of the original argument
p213
aVthat had gotten us there.
p214
aVFew of us today feel any need to put forth
p215
aVa rigorous philosophical argument
p216
aVas to why slavery is wrong
p217
aVor public hangings or beating children.
p218
aVBy now, these things just feel wrong.
p219
aVBut just those arguments had to be made,
p220
aVand they were, in centuries past.
p221
aa(lp222
VSP: Are you saying that people needed
p223
aVa step-by-step argument to grasp
p224
aVwhy something might be a wee bit wrong
p225
aVwith burning heretics at the stake?
p226
aa(lp227
VRNG: Oh, they did. Here's the French theologian
p228
aVSebastian Castellio making the case.
p229
aa(lp230
VSebastian Castellio: Calvin says that he's certain,
p231
aVand other sects say that they are.
p232
aVWho shall be judge?
p233
aVIf the matter is certain, to whom is it so? To Calvin?
p234
aVBut then, why does he write so many books about manifest truth?
p235
aVIn view of the uncertainty, we must define heretics
p236
aVsimply as one with whom we disagree.
p237
aVAnd if then we are going to kill heretics,
p238
aVthe logical outcome will be a war of extermination,
p239
aVsince each is sure of himself.
p240
aa(lp241
VSP: Or with hideous punishments
p242
aVlike breaking on the wheel?
p243
aa(lp244
VRNG: The prohibition in our constitution
p245
aVof cruel and unusual punishments
p246
aVwas a response to a pamphlet circulated in 1764
p247
aVby the Italian jurist Cesare Beccaria.
p248
aa(lp249
VCesare Beccaria: As punishments become more cruel,
p250
aVthe minds of men, which like fluids
p251
aValways adjust to the level of the objects
p252
aVthat surround them, become hardened,
p253
aVand after a hundred years of cruel punishments,
p254
aVbreaking on the wheel causes no more fear
p255
aVthan imprisonment previously did.
p256
aVFor a punishment to achieve its objective,
p257
aVit is only necessary that the harm that it inflicts
p258
aVoutweighs the benefit that derives from the crime,
p259
aVand into this calculation ought to be factored
p260
aVthe certainty of punishment
p261
aVand the loss of the good
p262
aVthat the commission of the crime will produce.
p263
aVEverything beyond this is superfluous,
p264
aVand therefore tyrannical.
p265
aa(lp266
VSP: But surely antiwar movements depended
p267
aVon mass demonstrations
p268
aVand catchy tunes by folk singers
p269
aVand wrenching photographs of the human costs of war.
p270
aa(lp271
VRNG: No doubt, but modern anti-war movements
p272
aVreach back to a long chain of thinkers
p273
aVwho had argued as to why we ought to mobilize
p274
aVour emotions against war,
p275
aVsuch as the father of modernity, Erasmus.
p276
aa(lp277
VErasmus: The advantages derived from peace
p278
aVdiffuse themselves far and wide,
p279
aVand reach great numbers,
p280
aVwhile in war, if anything turns out happily,
p281
aVthe advantage redounds only to a few,
p282
aVand those unworthy of reaping it.
p283
aVOne man's safety is owing to the destruction of another.
p284
aVOne man's prize is derived from the plunder of another.
p285
aVThe cause of rejoicings made by one side
p286
aVis to the other a cause of mourning.
p287
aVWhatever is unfortunate in war,
p288
aVis severely so indeed,
p289
aVand whatever, on the contrary,
p290
aVis called good fortune,
p291
aVis a savage and a cruel good fortune,
p292
aVan ungenerous happiness deriving its existence from another's woe.
p293
aa(lp294
VSP: But everyone knows that the movement
p295
aVto abolish slavery depended on faith and emotion.
p296
aVIt was a movement spearheaded by the Quakers,
p297
aVand it only became popular when Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel
p298
aV"Uncle Tom's Cabin" became a bestseller.
p299
aa(lp300
VRNG: But the ball got rolling a century before.
p301
aVJohn Locke bucked the tide of millennia
p302
aVthat had regarded the practice as perfectly natural.
p303
aVHe argued that it was inconsistent
p304
aVwith the principles of rational government.
p305
aa(lp306
VJohn Locke: Freedom of men under government
p307
aVis to have a standing rule to live by
p308
aVcommon to everyone of that society
p309
aVand made by the legislative power erected in it,
p310
aVa liberty to follow my own will in all things
p311
aVwhere that rule prescribes not,
p312
aVnot to be subject to the inconstant,
p313
aVuncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man,
p314
aVas freedom of nature is to be under no other restraint
p315
aVbut the law of nature.
p316
aa(lp317
VSP: Those words sound familiar.
p318
aVWhere have I read them before? Ah, yes.
p319
aa(lp320
VMary Astell: If absolute sovereignty  be not necessary
p321
aVin a state, how comes it to be so in a family?
p322
aVOr if in a family, why not in a state?
p323
aVSince no reason can be alleged for the one
p324
aVthat will not hold more strongly for the other,
p325
aVif all men are born free,
p326
aVhow is it that all women are born slaves,
p327
aVas they must be if being subjected
p328
aVto the inconstant, uncertain,
p329
aVunknown, arbitrary will of men
p330
aVbe the perfect condition of slavery?
p331
aa(lp332
VRNG: That sort of co-option
p333
aVis all in the job description of reason.
p334
aVOne movement for the expansion of rights
p335
aVinspires another because the logic is the same,
p336
aVand once that's hammered home,
p337
aVit becomes increasingly uncomfortable
p338
aVto ignore the inconsistency.
p339
aVIn the 1960s, the Civil Rights Movement
p340
aVinspired the movements for women's rights,
p341
aVchildren's rights, gay rights and even animal rights.
p342
aVBut fully two centuries before,
p343
aVthe Enlightenment thinker Jeremy Bentham
p344
aVhad exposed the indefensibility
p345
aVof customary practices such as
p346
aVthe cruelty to animals.
p347
aa(lp348
VJeremy Bentham: The question is not, can they reason,
p349
aVnor can they talk, but can they suffer?
p350
aa(lp351
VRNG: And the persecution of homosexuals.
p352
aa(lp353
VJB: As to any primary mischief,
p354
aVit's evident that it produces no pain in anyone.
p355
aVOn the contrary, it produces pleasure.
p356
aVThe partners are both willing.
p357
aVIf either of them be unwilling,
p358
aVthe act is an offense,
p359
aVtotally different in its nature of effects.
p360
aVIt's a personal injury. It's a kind of rape.
p361
aVAs to the any danger exclusive of pain,
p362
aVthe danger, if any, much consist
p363
aVin the tendency of the example.
p364
aVBut what is the tendency of this example?
p365
aVTo dispose others to engage in the same practices.
p366
aVBut this practice produces not pain of any kind
p367
aVto anyone.
p368
aa(lp369
VSP: Still, in every case, it took at least a century
p370
aVfor the arguments of these great thinkers
p371
aVto trickle down and infiltrate the population as a whole.
p372
aVIt kind of makes you wonder about our own time.
p373
aVAre there practices that we engage in
p374
aVwhere the arguments against them are there for all to see
p375
aVbut nonetheless we persist in them?
p376
aa(lp377
VRNG: When our great grandchildren look back at us,
p378
aVwill they be as appalled by some of our practices
p379
aVas we are by our slave-owning, heretic-burning,
p380
aVwife-beating, gay-bashing ancestors?
p381
aa(lp382
VSP: I'm sure everyone here could think of an example.
p383
aa(lp384
VRNG: I opt for the mistreatment of animals
p385
aVin factory farms.
p386
aa(lp387
VSP: The imprisonment of nonviolent drug offenders
p388
aVand the toleration of rape in our nation's prisons.
p389
aa(lp390
VRNG: Scrimping on donations to life-saving charities
p391
aVin the developing world.
p392
aa(lp393
VSP: The possession of nuclear weapons.
p394
aa(lp395
VRNG: The appeal to religion to justify
p396
aVthe otherwise unjustifiable,
p397
aVsuch as the ban on contraception.
p398
aa(lp399
VSP: What about religious faith in general?
p400
aa(lp401
VRNG: Eh, I'm not holding my breath.
p402
aa(lp403
VSP: Still, I have become convinced
p404
aVthat reason is a better angel
p405
aVthat deserves the greatest credit
p406
aVfor the moral progress our species has enjoyed
p407
aVand that holds out the greatest hope
p408
aVfor continuing moral progress in the future.
p409
aa(lp410
VRNG: And if, our friends,
p411
aVyou detect a flaw in this argument,
p412
aVjust remember you'll be depending on reason
p413
aVto point it out.
