VAlec Soth: So about 10 years ago, I got a call from a woman in Texas,
p4
aVStacey Baker,
p5
aVand she'd seen some of my photographs in an art exhibition
p6
aVand was wondering if she could commission me to take a portrait of her parents.
p7
aVNow, at the time I hadn't met Stacey, and I thought this was some sort of
p8
aVwealthy oil tycoon and I'd struck it rich,
p9
aVbut it was only later that I found out
p10
aVshe'd actually taken out a loan to make this happen.
p11
aa(lp12
VI took the picture of her parents,
p13
aVbut I was actually more excited about photographing Stacey.
p14
aVThe picture I made that day
p15
aVended up becoming one of my best-known portraits.
p16
aVAt the time I made this picture, Stacey was working as an attorney
p17
aVfor the State of Texas.
p18
aVNot long after, she left her job to study photography in Maine,
p19
aVand while she was there, she ended up meeting
p20
aVthe director of photography at the New York Times Magazine
p21
aVand was actually offered a job.
p22
aVStacey Baker: In the years since, Alec and I have done
p23
aVa number of magazine projects together,
p24
aVand we've become friends.
p25
aa(lp26
VA few months ago, I started talking to Alec about a fascination of mine.
p27
aVI've always been obsessed with how couples meet.
p28
aVI asked Alec how he and his wife Rachel met,
p29
aVand he told me the story of a high school football game
p30
aVwhere she was 16 and he was 15,
p31
aVand he asked her out.
p32
aVHe liked her purple hair.
p33
aVShe said yes, and that was it.
p34
aVI then asked Alec if he'd be interested in doing a photography project
p35
aVexploring this question.
p36
aa(lp37
VAS: And I was interested in the question, but I was actually much more interested
p38
aVin Stacey's motivation for asking it,
p39
aVparticularly since I'd never known Stacey to have a boyfriend.
p40
aVSo as part of this project, I thought it'd be interesting
p41
aVif she tried to meet someone.
p42
aVSo my idea was to have Stacey here go speed dating
p43
aVin Las Vegas on Valentine's Day.
p44
aV(Laughter) (Applause) (Music)
p45
aa(lp46
VSB: We ended up at what was advertised as the world's largest speed dating event.
p47
aVI had 19 dates
p48
aVand each date lasted three minutes.
p49
aVParticipants were given a list of ice- breaker questions to get the ball rolling,
p50
aVthings like, "If you could be any kind of animal, what would you be?"
p51
aVThat sort of thing.
p52
aa(lp53
VMy first date was Colin.
p54
aVHe's from England,
p55
aVand he once married a woman he met after placing an ad for a Capricorn.
p56
aVAlec and I saw him at the end of the evening,
p57
aVand he said he'd kissed a woman in line at one of the concession stands.
p58
aa(lp59
VZack and Chris came to the date-a-thon together.
p60
aa(lp61
VThis is Carl.
p62
aVI asked Carl, "What's the first thing you notice about a woman?"
p63
aVHe said, "Tits."
p64
aV(Laughter)
p65
aa(lp66
VMatthew is attracted to women with muscular calves.
p67
aVWe talked about running. He does triathlons, I run half-marathons.
p68
aVAlec actually liked his eyes and asked if I was attracted to him, but I wasn't,
p69
aVand I don't think he was attracted to me either.
p70
aa(lp71
VAustin and Mike came together.
p72
aVMike asked me a hypothetical question.
p73
aVHe said, "You're in an elevator running late for a meeting.
p74
aVSomeone makes a dash for the elevator.
p75
aVDo you hold it open for them?"
p76
aVAnd I said I would not.
p77
aV(Laughter)
p78
aa(lp79
VCliff said the first thing he notices about a woman is her teeth,
p80
aVand we complimented each other's teeth.
p81
aVBecause he's an open mouth sleeper,
p82
aVhe says he has to floss more to help prevent gum disease,
p83
aVand so I asked him how often he flosses,
p84
aVand he said, "Every other day."
p85
aV(Laughter)
p86
aVNow, as someone who flosses twice a day,
p87
aVI wasn't really sure that that was flossing more
p88
aVbut I don't think I said that out loud.
p89
aa(lp90
VBill is an auditor,
p91
aVand we talked the entire three minutes about auditing. (Laughter)
p92
aa(lp93
VThe first thing Spencer notices about a woman is her complexion.
p94
aVHe feels a lot of women wear too much makeup,
p95
aVand that they should only wear enough to accentuate the features that they have.
p96
aVI told him I didn't wear any makeup at all
p97
aVand he seemed to think that that was a good thing.
p98
aVCraig told me he didn't think I was willing to be vulnerable.
p99
aVHe was also frustrated when I couldn't remember my most embarrassing moment.
p100
aVHe thought I was lying, but I wasn't.
p101
aVI didn't think he liked me at all, but at the end of the night,
p102
aVhe came back to me and he gave me a box of chocolates.
p103
aa(lp104
VWilliam was really difficult to talk to.
p105
aVI think he was drunk.
p106
aV(Laughter)
p107
aa(lp108
VActor Chris McKenna was the MC of the event.
p109
aVHe used to be on "The Young and the Restless."
p110
aVI didn't actually go on a date with him.
p111
aVAlec said he saw several women give their phone numbers to him.
p112
aa(lp113
VNeedless to say, I didn't fall in love.
p114
aVI didn't feel a particular connection with any of the men that I went on dates with,
p115
aVand I didn't feel like they felt a particular connection with me either.
p116
aa(lp117
VAS: Now, the most beautiful thing to me \u2014
p118
aV(Laughter) \u2014 as a photographer is the quality of vulnerability.
p119
aVThe physical exterior reveals a crack in which you can get a glimpse
p120
aVat a more fragile interior.
p121
aVAt this date-a-thon event, I saw so many examples of that,
p122
aVbut as I watched Stacey's dates and talked to her about them,
p123
aVI realized how different photographic love is from real love.
p124
aa(lp125
VWhat is real love? How does it work?
p126
aVIn order to work on this question and to figure out how someone goes
p127
aVfrom meeting on a date to having a life together,
p128
aVStacey and I went to Sun City Summerlin,
p129
aVwhich is the largest retirement community in Las Vegas.
p130
aVOur contact there was George, who runs the community's photography club.
p131
aVHe arranged for us to meet other couples in their makeshift photo studio.
p132
aVSB: After 45 years of marriage, Anastasia's husband died two years ago,
p133
aa(lp134
Vso we asked if she had an old wedding picture.
p135
aVShe met her husband when she was a 15-year-old waitress
p136
aVat a small barbecue place in Michigan.
p137
aVHe was 30.
p138
aVShe'd lied about her age.
p139
aVHe was the first person she'd dated.
p140
aa(lp141
VDean had been named photographer of the year in Las Vegas two years in a row,
p142
aVand this caught Alec's attention,
p143
aVas did the fact  that he met his wife, Judy,
p144
aVat the same age when Alec met Rachel.
p145
aVDean admitted that he likes to look at beautiful women,
p146
aVbut he's never questioned his decision to marry Judy.
p147
aa(lp148
VAS: George met Josephine at a parish dance.
p149
aVHe was 18, she was 15.
p150
aVLike a lot of the couples we met, they weren't especially philosophical
p151
aVabout their early choices.
p152
aVGeorge said something that really stuck with me.
p153
aVHe said, "When you get that feeling, you just go with it."
p154
aa(lp155
VBob and Trudy met on a blind date when she was still in high school.
p156
aVThey said they weren't particularly attracted to each other
p157
aVwhen the first met.
p158
aVNevertheless, they were married soon after.
p159
aa(lp160
VSB: The story that stayed with me the most
p161
aVwas that of George, the photography club president, and his wife, Mary.
p162
aVThis was George and Mary's second marriage.
p163
aVThey met at a country-western club in Louisville, Kentucky called the Sahara.
p164
aVHe was there alone drinking and she was with friends.
p165
aVWhen they started dating, he owed the IRS 9,000 dollars in taxes,
p166
aVand she offered to help him get out of debt,
p167
aVso for the next year, he turned his paychecks over to Mary,
p168
aVand she got him out of debt.
p169
aVGeorge was actually an alcoholic when they married, and Mary knew it.
p170
aVAt some point in their marriage, he says he consumed
p171
aV54 beers in one day.
p172
aVAnother time, when he was drunk, he threatened to kill Mary
p173
aVand her two kids,
p174
aVbut they escaped and a SWAT team was called to the house.
p175
aVAmazingly, Mary took him back,
p176
aVand eventually things got better.
p177
aVGeorge has been involved in Alcoholics Anonymous
p178
aVand hasn't had a drink in 36 years.
p179
aa(lp180
V(Music)
p181
aa(lp182
VAt the end of the day, after we left Sun City,
p183
aVI told Alec that I didn't actually think
p184
aVthat the stories of how these couples met were all that interesting.
p185
aVWhat was more interesting
p186
aVwas how they managed to stay together.
p187
aa(lp188
VAS: They all had this beautiful quality of endurance,
p189
aVbut that was true of the singles, too.
p190
aVThe world is hard, and the singles were out there
p191
aVtrying to connect with other people,
p192
aVand the couples were holding onto each other
p193
aVafter all these decades.
p194
aa(lp195
VMy favorite pictures on this trip were of Joe and Roseanne.
p196
aVNow, by the time we met Joe and Roseanne,
p197
aVwe'd gotten in the habit of asking couples if they had an old wedding photograph.
p198
aVIn their case, they simultaneously pulled out of their wallets
p199
aVthe exact same photograph.
p200
aVWhat's more beautiful, I thought to myself,
p201
aVthis image of a young couple who has just fallen in love
p202
aVor the idea of these two people holding onto this image for decades?
p203
aa(lp204
VThank you.
