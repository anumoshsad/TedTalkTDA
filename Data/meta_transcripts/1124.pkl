VSo I was privileged to train in transplantation
p4
aVunder two great surgical pioneers:
p5
aVThomas Starzl,
p6
aVwho performed the world's first successful liver transplant
p7
aVin 1967,
p8
aVand Sir Roy Calne,
p9
aVwho performed the first liver transplant in the U.K.
p10
aVin the following year.
p11
aVI returned to Singapore
p12
aVand, in 1990,
p13
aVperformed Asia's first successful
p14
aVcadaveric liver transplant procedure,
p15
aVbut against all odds.
p16
aVNow when I look back,
p17
aVthe transplant was actually the easiest part.
p18
aVNext, raising the money to fund the procedure.
p19
aVBut perhaps the most challenging part
p20
aVwas to convince the regulators \u2014
p21
aVa matter which was debated in the parliament \u2014
p22
aVthat a young female surgeon
p23
aVbe allowed the opportunity
p24
aVto pioneer for her country.
p25
aVBut 20 years on,
p26
aVmy patient, Surinder,
p27
aVis Asia's longest surviving
p28
aVcadaveric liver transplant to date.
p29
aV(Applause)
p30
aVAnd perhaps more important,
p31
aVI am the proud godmother
p32
aVto her 14 year-old son.
p33
aa(lp34
V(Applause)
p35
aa(lp36
VBut not all patients on the transplant wait list
p37
aVare so fortunate.
p38
aVThe truth is,
p39
aVthere are just simply not enough donor organs
p40
aVto go around.
p41
aVAs the demand for donor organs
p42
aVcontinues to rise,
p43
aVin large part due to the aging population,
p44
aVthe supply has remained relatively constant.
p45
aVIn the United States alone,
p46
aV100,000 men, women and children
p47
aVare on the waiting list for donor organs,
p48
aVand more than a dozen die each day
p49
aVbecause of a lack of donor organs.
p50
aVThe transplant community
p51
aVhas actively campaigned in organ donation.
p52
aVAnd the gift of life
p53
aVhas been extended
p54
aVfrom brain-dead donors
p55
aVto living, related donors \u2014
p56
aVrelatives who might donate an organ
p57
aVor a part of an organ,
p58
aVlike a split liver graft,
p59
aVto a relative or loved one.
p60
aa(lp61
VBut as there was still a dire shortage of donor organs,
p62
aVthe gift of life was then extended
p63
aVfrom living, related donors
p64
aVto now living, unrelated donors.
p65
aVAnd this then has given rise
p66
aVto unprecedented and unexpected
p67
aVmoral controversy.
p68
aVHow can one distinguish
p69
aVa donation that is voluntary and altruistic
p70
aVfrom one that is forced or coerced
p71
aVfrom, for example,
p72
aVa submissive spouse, an in-law,
p73
aVa servant, a slave,
p74
aVan employee?
p75
aVWhere and how can we draw the line?
p76
aVIn my part of the world,
p77
aVtoo many people live below the poverty line.
p78
aVAnd in some areas,
p79
aVthe commercial gifting of an organ
p80
aVin exchange for monetary reward
p81
aVhas led to a flourishing trade
p82
aVin living, unrelated donors.
p83
aa(lp84
VShortly after I performed the first liver transplant,
p85
aVI received my next assignment,
p86
aVand that was to go to the prisons
p87
aVto harvest organs
p88
aVfrom executed prisoners.
p89
aVI was also pregnant at the time.
p90
aVPregnancies are meant
p91
aVto be happy and fulfilling moments
p92
aVin any woman's life.
p93
aVBut my joyful period
p94
aVwas marred by solemn and morbid thoughts \u2014
p95
aVthoughts of walking through
p96
aVthe prison's high-security death row,
p97
aVas this was the only route
p98
aVto take me to the makeshift operating room.
p99
aVAnd at each time,
p100
aVI would feel the chilling stares
p101
aVof condemned prisoners' eyes follow me.
p102
aVAnd for two years,
p103
aVI struggled with the dilemma
p104
aVof waking up at 4:30 am
p105
aVon a Friday morning,
p106
aVdriving to the prison,
p107
aVgetting down, gloved and scrubbed,
p108
aVready to receive the body
p109
aVof an executed prisoner,
p110
aVremove the organs
p111
aVand then transport these organs
p112
aVto the recipient hospital
p113
aVand then graft the gift of life
p114
aVto a recipient the same afternoon.
p115
aVNo doubt, I was informed,
p116
aVthe consent had been obtained.
p117
aa(lp118
VBut, in my life,
p119
aVthe one fulfilling skill that I had
p120
aVwas now invoking feelings of conflict \u2014
p121
aVconflict ranging
p122
aVfrom extreme sorrow and doubt at dawn
p123
aVto celebratory joy
p124
aVat engrafting the gift of life at dusk.
p125
aVIn my team,
p126
aVthe lives of one or two of my colleagues
p127
aVwere tainted by this experience.
p128
aVSome of us may have been sublimated,
p129
aVbut really none of us remained the same.
p130
aVI was troubled
p131
aVthat the retrieval of organs from executed prisoners
p132
aVwas at least as morally controversial
p133
aVas the harvesting of stem cells
p134
aVfrom human embryos.
p135
aVAnd in my mind,
p136
aVI realized as a surgical pioneer
p137
aVthat the purpose of my position of influence
p138
aVwas surely to speak up
p139
aVfor those who have no influence.
p140
aVIt made me wonder
p141
aVif there could be a better way \u2014
p142
aVa way to circumvent death
p143
aVand yet deliver the gift of life
p144
aVthat might exponentially impact
p145
aVmillions of patients worldwide.
p146
aa(lp147
VNow just about that time,
p148
aVthe practice of surgery evolved
p149
aVfrom big to small,
p150
aVfrom wide open incisions
p151
aVto keyhole procedures,
p152
aVtiny incisions.
p153
aVAnd in transplantation, concepts shifted
p154
aVfrom whole organs to cells.
p155
aVIn 1988, at the University of Minnesota,
p156
aVI participated in a small series
p157
aVof whole organ pancreas transplants.
p158
aVI witnessed the technical difficulty.
p159
aVAnd this inspired in my mind
p160
aVa shift from transplanting whole organs
p161
aVto perhaps transplanting cells.
p162
aVI thought to myself,
p163
aVwhy not take the individual cells
p164
aVout of the pancreas \u2014
p165
aVthe cells that secrete insulin to cure diabetes \u2014
p166
aVand transplant these cells? \u2014
p167
aVtechnically a much simpler procedure
p168
aVthan having to grapple with the complexities
p169
aVof transplanting a whole organ.
p170
aa(lp171
VAnd at that time,
p172
aVstem cell research
p173
aVhad gained momentum,
p174
aVfollowing the isolation of the world's first
p175
aVhuman embryonic stem cells
p176
aVin the 1990s.
p177
aVThe observation that stem cells, as master cells,
p178
aVcould give rise
p179
aVto a whole variety of different cell types \u2014
p180
aVheart cells, liver cells,
p181
aVpancreatic islet cells \u2014
p182
aVcaptured the attention of the media
p183
aVand the imagination of the public.
p184
aVI too was fascinated
p185
aVby this new and disruptive cell technology,
p186
aVand this inspired a shift in my mindset,
p187
aVfrom transplanting whole organs
p188
aVto transplanting cells.
p189
aVAnd I focused my research on stem cells
p190
aVas a possible source
p191
aVfor cell transplants.
p192
aa(lp193
VToday we realize
p194
aVthat there are many different types of stem cells.
p195
aVEmbryonic stem cells
p196
aVhave occupied center stage,
p197
aVchiefly because of their pluripotency \u2014
p198
aVthat is their ease in differentiating
p199
aVinto a variety of different cell types.
p200
aVBut the moral controversy
p201
aVsurrounding embryonic stem cells \u2014
p202
aVthe fact that these cells are derived
p203
aVfrom five-day old human embryos \u2014
p204
aVhas encouraged research
p205
aVinto other types of stem cells.
p206
aa(lp207
VNow to the ridicule of my colleagues,
p208
aVI inspired my lab
p209
aVto focus on what I thought
p210
aVwas the most non-controversial source of stem cells,
p211
aVadipose tissue, or fat, yes fat \u2014
p212
aVnowadays available in abundant supply \u2014
p213
aVyou and I, I think, would be very happy to get rid of anyway.
p214
aVFat-derived stem cells
p215
aVare adult stem cells.
p216
aVAnd adult stem cells
p217
aVare found in you and me \u2014
p218
aVin our blood, in our bone marrow,
p219
aVin our fat, our skin and other organs.
p220
aVAnd as it turns out,
p221
aVfat is one of the best sources
p222
aVof adult stem cells.
p223
aVBut adult stem cells
p224
aVare not embryonic stem cells.
p225
aVAnd here is the limitation:
p226
aVadult stem cells are mature cells,
p227
aVand, like mature human beings,
p228
aVthese cells are more restricted in their thought
p229
aVand more restricted in their behavior
p230
aVand are unable to give rise
p231
aVto the wide variety of specialized cell types,
p232
aVas embryonic stem cells [can].
p233
aa(lp234
VBut in 2007,
p235
aVtwo remarkable individuals,
p236
aVShinya Yamanaka of Japan
p237
aVand Jamie Thomson of the United States,
p238
aVmade an astounding discovery.
p239
aVThey discovered
p240
aVthat adult cells, taken from you and me,
p241
aVcould be reprogrammed
p242
aVback into embryonic-like cells,
p243
aVwhich they termed IPS cells,
p244
aVor induced pluripotent stem cells.
p245
aVAnd so guess what,
p246
aVscientists around the world and in the labs
p247
aVare racing
p248
aVto convert aging adult cells \u2014
p249
aVaging adult cells from you and me \u2014
p250
aVthey are racing to reprogram these cells
p251
aVback into more useful IPS cells.
p252
aVAnd in our lab,
p253
aVwe are focused on taking fat
p254
aVand reprogramming
p255
aVmounds of fat
p256
aVinto fountains of youthful cells \u2014
p257
aVcells that we may use
p258
aVto then form other,
p259
aVmore specialized, cells,
p260
aVwhich one day may be used as cell transplants.
p261
aVIf this research is successful,
p262
aVit may then reduce the need
p263
aVto research and sacrifice
p264
aVhuman embryos.
p265
aa(lp266
VIndeed, there is a lot of hype, but also hope
p267
aVthat the promise of stem cells
p268
aVwill one day provide cures
p269
aVfor a whole range of conditions.
p270
aVHeart disease, stroke, diabetes,
p271
aVspinal cord injury, muscular dystrophy,
p272
aVretinal eye diseases \u2014
p273
aVare any of these conditions
p274
aVrelevant, personally, to you?
p275
aa(lp276
VIn May 2006,
p277
aVsomething horrible happened to me.
p278
aVI was about to start a robotic operation,
p279
aVbut stepping out of the elevator
p280
aVinto the bright and glaring lights of the operating room,
p281
aVI realized
p282
aVthat my left visual field
p283
aVwas fast collapsing into darkness.
p284
aVEarlier that week,
p285
aVI had taken a rather hard knock
p286
aVduring late spring skiing \u2014 yes, I fell.
p287
aVAnd I started to see floaters and stars,
p288
aVwhich I casually dismissed
p289
aVas too much high-altitude sun exposure.
p290
aVWhat happened to me
p291
aVmight have been catastrophic,
p292
aVif not for the fact
p293
aVthat I was in reach of good surgical access.
p294
aVAnd I had my vision restored,
p295
aVbut not before a prolonged period of convalescence \u2014
p296
aVthree months \u2014
p297
aVin a head down position.
p298
aVThis experience
p299
aVtaught me to empathize more with my patients,
p300
aVand especially those with retinal diseases.
p301
aa(lp302
V37 million people worldwide
p303
aVare blind,
p304
aVand 127 million more
p305
aVsuffer from impaired vision.
p306
aVStem cell-derived retinal transplants,
p307
aVnow in a research phase,
p308
aVmay one day restore vision,
p309
aVor part vision,
p310
aVto millions of patients with retinal diseases worldwide.
p311
aVIndeed, we live
p312
aVin both challenging
p313
aVas well as exciting times.
p314
aVAs the world population ages,
p315
aVscientists are racing
p316
aVto discover new ways
p317
aVto enhance the power of the body
p318
aVto heal itself through stem cells.
p319
aa(lp320
VIt is a fact
p321
aVthat when our organs or tissues are injured,
p322
aVour bone marrow
p323
aVreleases stem cells
p324
aVinto our circulation.
p325
aVAnd these stem cells
p326
aVthen float in the bloodstream
p327
aVand hone in to damaged organs
p328
aVto release growth factors
p329
aVto repair the damaged tissue.
p330
aVStem cells may be used as building blocks
p331
aVto repair damaged scaffolds within our body,
p332
aVor to provide new liver cells
p333
aVto repair damaged liver.
p334
aVAs we speak, there are 117 or so clinical trials
p335
aVresearching the use of stem cells
p336
aVfor liver diseases.
p337
aa(lp338
VWhat lies ahead?
p339
aVHeart disease
p340
aVis the leading cause of death worldwide.
p341
aV1.1 million Americans
p342
aVsuffer heart attacks yearly.
p343
aV4.8 million
p344
aVsuffer cardiac failure.
p345
aVStem cells may be used
p346
aVto deliver growth factors
p347
aVto repair damaged heart muscle
p348
aVor be differentiated
p349
aVinto heart muscle cells
p350
aVto restore heart function.
p351
aVThere are 170 clinical trials
p352
aVinvestigating the role of stem cells in heart disease.
p353
aVWhile still in a research phase,
p354
aVstem cells may one day herald
p355
aVa quantum leap in the field of cardiology.
p356
aa(lp357
VStem cells provide hope for new beginnings \u2014
p358
aVsmall, incremental steps,
p359
aVcells rather than organs,
p360
aVrepair rather than replacement.
p361
aVStem cell therapies
p362
aVmay one day reduce the need for donor organs.
p363
aVPowerful new technologies
p364
aValways present enigmas.
p365
aVAs we speak,
p366
aVthe world's first human embryonic stem cell trial for spinal cord injury
p367
aVis currently underway
p368
aVfollowing the USFDA approval.
p369
aVAnd in the U.K.,
p370
aVneural stem cells to treat stroke
p371
aVare being investigated in a phase one trial.
p372
aa(lp373
VThe research success that we celebrate today
p374
aVhas been made possible
p375
aVby the curiosity and contribution and commitment
p376
aVof individual scientists
p377
aVand medical pioneers.
p378
aVEach one has his story.
p379
aVMy story has been about my journey
p380
aVfrom organs to cells \u2014
p381
aVa journey through controversy,
p382
aVinspired by hope \u2014
p383
aVhope that, as we age,
p384
aVyou and I may one day celebrate longevity
p385
aVwith an improved quality of life.
