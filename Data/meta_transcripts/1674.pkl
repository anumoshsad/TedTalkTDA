VI grew up watching Star Trek. I love Star Trek.
p4
aVStar Trek made me want to see alien creatures,
p5
aVcreatures from a far-distant world.
p6
aVBut basically, I figured out that I could find
p7
aVthose alien creatures right on Earth.
p8
aa(lp9
VAnd what I do is I study insects.
p10
aVI'm obsessed with insects, particularly insect flight.
p11
aVI think the evolution of insect flight is perhaps
p12
aVone of the most important events in the history of life.
p13
aVWithout insects, there'd be no flowering plants.
p14
aVWithout flowering plants, there would be no
p15
aVclever, fruit-eating primates giving TED Talks.
p16
aa(lp17
V(Laughter)
p18
aa(lp19
VNow,
p20
aVDavid and Hidehiko and Ketaki
p21
aVgave a very compelling story about
p22
aVthe similarities between fruit flies and humans,
p23
aVand there are many similarities,
p24
aVand so you might think that if humans are similar to fruit flies,
p25
aVthe favorite behavior of a fruit fly might be this, for example \u2014
p26
aV(Laughter)
p27
aVbut in my talk, I don't want to emphasize on the similarities
p28
aVbetween humans and fruit flies, but rather the differences,
p29
aVand focus on the behaviors that I think fruit flies excel at doing.
p30
aa(lp31
VAnd so I want to show you a high-speed video sequence
p32
aVof a fly shot at 7,000 frames per second in infrared lighting,
p33
aVand to the right, off-screen, is an electronic looming predator
p34
aVthat is going to go at the fly.
p35
aVThe fly is going to sense this predator.
p36
aVIt is going to extend its legs out.
p37
aVIt's going to sashay away
p38
aVto live to fly another day.
p39
aVNow I have carefully cropped this sequence
p40
aVto be exactly the duration of a human eye blink,
p41
aVso in the time that it would take you to blink your eye,
p42
aVthe fly has seen this looming predator,
p43
aVestimated its position, initiated a motor pattern to fly it away,
p44
aVbeating its wings at 220 times a second as it does so.
p45
aVI think this is a fascinating behavior
p46
aVthat shows how fast the fly's brain can process information.
p47
aa(lp48
VNow, flight \u2014 what does it take to fly?
p49
aVWell, in order to fly, just as in a human aircraft,
p50
aVyou need wings that can generate sufficient aerodynamic forces,
p51
aVyou need an engine sufficient to generate the power required for flight,
p52
aVand you need a controller,
p53
aVand in the first human aircraft, the controller was basically
p54
aVthe brain of Orville and Wilbur sitting in the cockpit.
p55
aa(lp56
VNow, how does this compare to a fly?
p57
aVWell, I spent a lot of my early career trying to figure out
p58
aVhow insect wings generate enough force to keep the flies in the air.
p59
aVAnd you might have heard how engineers proved
p60
aVthat bumblebees couldn't fly.
p61
aVWell, the problem was in thinking that the insect wings
p62
aVfunction in the way that aircraft wings work. But they don't.
p63
aVAnd we tackle this problem by building giant,
p64
aVdynamically scaled model robot insects
p65
aVthat would flap in giant pools of mineral oil
p66
aVwhere we could study the aerodynamic forces.
p67
aVAnd it turns out that the insects flap their wings
p68
aVin a very clever way, at a very high angle of attack
p69
aVthat creates a structure at the leading edge of the wing,
p70
aVa little tornado-like structure called a leading edge vortex,
p71
aVand it's that vortex that actually enables the wings
p72
aVto make enough force for the animal to stay in the air.
p73
aVBut the thing that's actually most \u2014 so, what's fascinating
p74
aVis not so much that the wing has some interesting morphology.
p75
aVWhat's clever is the way the fly flaps it,
p76
aVwhich of course ultimately is controlled by the nervous system,
p77
aVand this is what enables flies to perform
p78
aVthese remarkable aerial maneuvers.
p79
aa(lp80
VNow, what about the engine?
p81
aVThe engine of the fly is absolutely fascinating.
p82
aVThey have two types of flight muscle:
p83
aVso-called power muscle, which is stretch-activated,
p84
aVwhich means that it activates itself and does not need to be controlled
p85
aVon a contraction-by-contraction basis by the nervous system.
p86
aVIt's specialized to generate the enormous power required for flight,
p87
aVand it fills the middle portion of the fly,
p88
aVso when a fly hits your windshield,
p89
aVit's basically the power muscle that you're looking at.
p90
aVBut attached to the base of the wing
p91
aVis a set of little, tiny control muscles
p92
aVthat are not very powerful at all, but they're very fast,
p93
aVand they're able to reconfigure the hinge of the wing
p94
aVon a stroke-by-stroke basis,
p95
aVand this is what enables the fly to change its wing
p96
aVand generate the changes in aerodynamic forces
p97
aVwhich change its flight trajectory.
p98
aVAnd of course, the role of the nervous system is to control all this.
p99
aa(lp100
VSo let's look at the controller.
p101
aVNow flies excel in the sorts of sensors
p102
aVthat they carry to this problem.
p103
aVThey have antennae that sense odors and detect wind detection.
p104
aVThey have a sophisticated eye which is
p105
aVthe fastest visual system on the planet.
p106
aVThey have another set of eyes on the top of their head.
p107
aVWe have no idea what they do.
p108
aVThey have sensors on their wing.
p109
aVTheir wing is covered with sensors, including sensors
p110
aVthat sense deformation of the wing.
p111
aVThey can even taste with their wings.
p112
aVOne of the most sophisticated sensors a fly has
p113
aVis a structure called the halteres.
p114
aVThe halteres are actually gyroscopes.
p115
aVThese devices beat back and forth about 200 hertz during flight,
p116
aVand the animal can use them to sense its body rotation
p117
aVand initiate very, very fast corrective maneuvers.
p118
aVBut all of this sensory information has to be processed
p119
aVby a brain, and yes, indeed, flies have a brain,
p120
aVa brain of about 100,000 neurons.
p121
aa(lp122
VNow several people at this conference
p123
aVhave already suggested that fruit flies could serve neuroscience
p124
aVbecause they're a simple model of brain function.
p125
aVAnd the basic punchline of my talk is,
p126
aVI'd like to turn that over on its head.
p127
aVI don't think they're a simple model of anything.
p128
aVAnd I think that flies are a great model.
p129
aVThey're a great model for flies.
p130
aV(Laughter)
p131
aa(lp132
VAnd let's explore this notion of simplicity.
p133
aVSo I think, unfortunately, a lot of neuroscientists,
p134
aVwe're all somewhat narcissistic.
p135
aVWhen we think of brain, we of course imagine our own brain.
p136
aVBut remember that this kind of brain,
p137
aVwhich is much, much smaller
p138
aV\u2014 instead of 100 billion neurons, it has 100,000 neurons \u2014
p139
aVbut this is the most common form of brain on the planet
p140
aVand has been for 400 million years.
p141
aVAnd is it fair to say that it's simple?
p142
aVWell, it's simple in the sense that it has fewer neurons,
p143
aVbut is that a fair metric?
p144
aVAnd I would propose it's not a fair metric.
p145
aVSo let's sort of think about this. I think we have to compare \u2014
p146
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p147
aVwe have to compare the size of the brain
p148
aVwith what the brain can do.
p149
aVSo I propose we have a Trump number,
p150
aVand the Trump number is the ratio of this man's
p151
aVbehavioral repertoire to the number of neurons in his brain.
p152
aVWe'll calculate the Trump number for the fruit fly.
p153
aVNow, how many people here think the Trump number
p154
aVis higher for the fruit fly?
p155
aa(lp156
V(Applause)
p157
aa(lp158
VIt's a very smart, smart audience.
p159
aVYes, the inequality goes in this direction, or I would posit it.
p160
aa(lp161
VNow I realize that it is a little bit absurd
p162
aVto compare the behavioral repertoire of a human to a fly.
p163
aVBut let's take another animal just as an example. Here's a mouse.
p164
aVA mouse has about 1,000 times as many neurons as a fly.
p165
aVI used to study mice. When I studied mice,
p166
aVI used to talk really slowly.
p167
aVAnd then something happened when I started to work on flies.
p168
aV(Laughter)
p169
aVAnd I think if you compare the natural history of flies and mice,
p170
aVit's really comparable. They have to forage for food.
p171
aVThey have to engage in courtship.
p172
aVThey have sex. They hide from predators.
p173
aVThey do a lot of the similar things.
p174
aVBut I would argue that flies do more.
p175
aVSo for example, I'm going to show you a sequence,
p176
aVand I have to say, some of my funding comes from the military,
p177
aVso I'm showing this classified sequence
p178
aVand you cannot discuss it outside of this room. Okay?
p179
aVSo I want you to look at the payload
p180
aVat the tail of the fruit fly.
p181
aVWatch it very closely,
p182
aVand you'll see why my six-year-old son
p183
aVnow wants to be a neuroscientist.
p184
aVWait for it.
p185
aVPshhew.
p186
aVSo at least you'll admit that if fruit flies are not as clever as mice,
p187
aVthey're at least as clever as pigeons. (Laughter)
p188
aa(lp189
VNow, I want to get across that it's not just a matter of numbers
p190
aVbut also the challenge for a fly to compute
p191
aVeverything its brain has to compute with such tiny neurons.
p192
aVSo this is a beautiful image of a visual interneuron from a mouse
p193
aVthat came from Jeff Lichtman's lab,
p194
aVand you can see the wonderful images of brains
p195
aVthat he showed in his talk.
p196
aVBut up in the corner, in the right corner, you'll see,
p197
aVat the same scale, a visual interneuron from a fly.
p198
aVAnd I'll expand this up.
p199
aVAnd it's a beautifully complex neuron.
p200
aVIt's just very, very tiny, and there's lots of biophysical challenges
p201
aVwith trying to compute information with tiny, tiny neurons.
p202
aa(lp203
VHow small can neurons get? Well, look at this interesting insect.
p204
aVIt looks sort of like a fly. It has wings, it has eyes,
p205
aVit has antennae, its legs, complicated life history,
p206
aVit's a parasite, it has to fly around and find caterpillars
p207
aVto parasatize,
p208
aVbut not only is its brain the size of a salt grain,
p209
aVwhich is comparable for a fruit fly,
p210
aVit is the size of a salt grain.
p211
aVSo here's some other organisms at the similar scale.
p212
aVThis animal is the size of a paramecium and an amoeba,
p213
aVand it has a brain of 7,000 neurons that's so small \u2014
p214
aVyou know these things called cell bodies you've been hearing about,
p215
aVwhere the nucleus of the neuron is?
p216
aVThis animal gets rid of them because they take up too much space.
p217
aVSo this is a session on frontiers in neuroscience.
p218
aVI would posit that one frontier in neuroscience is to figure out how the brain of that thing works.
p219
aa(lp220
VBut let's think about this. How can you make a small number of neurons do a lot?
p221
aVAnd I think, from an engineering perspective,
p222
aVyou think of multiplexing.
p223
aVYou can take a hardware and have that hardware
p224
aVdo different things at different times,
p225
aVor have different parts of the hardware doing different things.
p226
aVAnd these are the two concepts I'd like to explore.
p227
aVAnd they're not concepts that I've come up with,
p228
aVbut concepts that have been proposed by others in the past.
p229
aa(lp230
VAnd one idea comes from lessons from chewing crabs.
p231
aVAnd I don't mean chewing the crabs.
p232
aVI grew up in Baltimore, and I chew crabs very, very well.
p233
aVBut I'm talking about the crabs actually doing the chewing.
p234
aVCrab chewing is actually really fascinating.
p235
aVCrabs have this complicated structure under their carapace
p236
aVcalled the gastric mill
p237
aVthat grinds their food in a variety of different ways.
p238
aVAnd here's an endoscopic movie of this structure.
p239
aVThe amazing thing about this is that it's controlled
p240
aVby a really tiny set of neurons, about two dozen neurons
p241
aVthat can produce a vast variety of different motor patterns,
p242
aVand the reason it can do this is that this little tiny ganglion
p243
aVin the crab is actually inundated by many, many neuromodulators.
p244
aVYou heard about neuromodulators earlier.
p245
aVThere are more neuromodulators
p246
aVthat alter, that innervate this structure than actually neurons in the structure,
p247
aVand they're able to generate a complicated set of patterns.
p248
aVAnd this is the work by Eve Marder and her many colleagues
p249
aVwho've been studying this fascinating system
p250
aVthat show how a smaller cluster of neurons
p251
aVcan do many, many, many things
p252
aVbecause of neuromodulation that can take place on a moment-by-moment basis.
p253
aVSo this is basically multiplexing in time.
p254
aVImagine a network of neurons with one neuromodulator.
p255
aVYou select one set of cells to perform one sort of behavior,
p256
aVanother neuromodulator, another set of cells,
p257
aVa different pattern, and you can imagine
p258
aVyou could extrapolate to a very, very complicated system.
p259
aa(lp260
VIs there any evidence that flies do this?
p261
aVWell, for many years in my laboratory and other laboratories around the world,
p262
aVwe've been studying fly behaviors in little flight simulators.
p263
aVYou can tether a fly to a little stick.
p264
aVYou can measure the aerodynamic forces it's creating.
p265
aVYou can let the fly play a little video game
p266
aVby letting it fly around in a visual display.
p267
aVSo let me show you a little tiny sequence of this.
p268
aVHere's a fly
p269
aVand a large infrared view of the fly in the flight simulator,
p270
aVand this is a game the flies love to play.
p271
aVYou allow them to steer towards the little stripe,
p272
aVand they'll just steer towards that stripe forever.
p273
aVIt's part of their visual guidance system.
p274
aVBut very, very recently, it's been possible
p275
aVto modify these sorts of behavioral arenas for physiologies.
p276
aVSo this is the preparation that one of my former post-docs,
p277
aVGaby Maimon, who's now at Rockefeller, developed,
p278
aVand it's basically a flight simulator
p279
aVbut under conditions where you actually can stick an electrode
p280
aVin the brain of the fly and record
p281
aVfrom a genetically identified neuron in the fly's brain.
p282
aVAnd this is what one of these experiments looks like.
p283
aVIt was a sequence taken from another post-doc in the lab,
p284
aVBettina Schnell.
p285
aVThe green trace at the bottom is the membrane potential
p286
aVof a neuron in the fly's brain,
p287
aVand you'll see the fly start to fly, and the fly is actually
p288
aVcontrolling the rotation of that visual pattern itself
p289
aVby its own wing motion,
p290
aVand you can see this visual interneuron
p291
aVrespond to the pattern of wing motion as the fly flies.
p292
aVSo for the first time we've actually been able to record
p293
aVfrom neurons in the fly's brain while the fly
p294
aVis performing sophisticated behaviors such as flight.
p295
aVAnd one of the lessons we've been learning
p296
aVis that the physiology of cells that we've been studying
p297
aVfor many years in quiescent flies
p298
aVis not the same as the physiology of those cells
p299
aVwhen the flies actually engage in active behaviors
p300
aVlike flying and walking and so forth.
p301
aVAnd why is the physiology different?
p302
aVWell it turns out it's these neuromodulators,
p303
aVjust like the neuromodulators in that little tiny ganglion in the crabs.
p304
aVSo here's a picture of the octopamine system.
p305
aVOctopamine is a neuromodulator
p306
aVthat seems to play an important role in flight and other behaviors.
p307
aVBut this is just one of many neuromodulators
p308
aVthat's in the fly's brain.
p309
aVSo I really think that, as we learn more,
p310
aVit's going to turn out that the whole fly brain
p311
aVis just like a large version of this stomatogastric ganglion,
p312
aVand that's one of the reasons why it can do so much with so few neurons.
p313
aa(lp314
VNow, another idea, another way of multiplexing
p315
aVis multiplexing in space,
p316
aVhaving different parts of a neuron
p317
aVdo different things at the same time.
p318
aVSo here's two sort of canonical neurons
p319
aVfrom a vertebrate and an invertebrate,
p320
aVa human pyramidal neuron from Ramon y Cajal,
p321
aVand another cell to the right, a non-spiking interneuron,
p322
aVand this is the work of Alan Watson and Malcolm Burrows many years ago,
p323
aVand Malcolm Burrows came up with a pretty interesting idea
p324
aVbased on the fact that this neuron from a locust
p325
aVdoes not fire action potentials.
p326
aVIt's a non-spiking cell.
p327
aVSo a typical cell, like the neurons in our brain,
p328
aVhas a region called the dendrites that receives input,
p329
aVand that input sums together
p330
aVand will produce action potentials
p331
aVthat run down the axon and then activate
p332
aVall the output regions of the neuron.
p333
aVBut non-spiking neurons are actually quite complicated
p334
aVbecause they can have input synapses and output synapses
p335
aVall interdigitated, and there's no single action potential
p336
aVthat drives all the outputs at the same time.
p337
aVSo there's a possibility that you have computational compartments
p338
aVthat allow the different parts of the neuron
p339
aVto do different things at the same time.
p340
aa(lp341
VSo these basic concepts of multitasking in time
p342
aVand multitasking in space,
p343
aVI think these are things that are true in our brains as well,
p344
aVbut I think the insects are the true masters of this.
p345
aVSo I hope you think of insects a little bit differently next time,
p346
aVand as I say up here, please think before you swat.
