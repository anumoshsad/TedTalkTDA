VSo I'm an artist,
p4
aVbut a little bit of a peculiar one.
p5
aVI don't paint.
p6
aVI can't draw.
p7
aVMy shop teacher in high school wrote that I was a menace
p8
aVon my report card.
p9
aVYou probably don't really want to see my photographs.
p10
aVBut there is one thing I know how to do:
p11
aVI know how to program a computer.
p12
aVI can code.
p13
aa(lp14
VAnd people will tell me that 100 years ago,
p15
aVfolks like me didn't exist,
p16
aVthat it was impossible,
p17
aVthat art made with data is a new thing,
p18
aVit's a product of our age,
p19
aVit's something that's really important
p20
aVto think of as something that's very "now."
p21
aVAnd that's true.
p22
aa(lp23
VBut there is an art form that's been around for a very long time
p24
aVthat's really about using information,
p25
aVabstract information,
p26
aVto make emotionally resonant pieces.
p27
aVAnd it's called music.
p28
aVWe've been making music for tens of thousands of years, right?
p29
aVAnd if you think about what music is \u2014
p30
aVnotes and chords and keys and harmonies and melodies \u2014
p31
aVthese things are algorithms.
p32
aVThese things are systems
p33
aVthat are designed to unfold over time,
p34
aVto make us feel.
p35
aVI came to the arts through music.
p36
aVI was trained as a composer,
p37
aVand about 15 years ago, I started making pieces
p38
aVthat were designed to look at the intersection
p39
aVbetween sound and image,
p40
aVto use an image to unveil a musical structure
p41
aVor to use a sound to show you something interesting
p42
aVabout something that's usually pictorial.
p43
aa(lp44
VSo what you're seeing on the screen is literally being drawn
p45
aVby the musical structure of the musicians onstage,
p46
aVand there's no accident that it looks like a plant,
p47
aVbecause the underlying algorithmic biology of the plant
p48
aVis what informed the musical structure in the first place.
p49
aVSo once you know how to do this, once you know how to code with media,
p50
aVyou can do some pretty cool stuff.
p51
aa(lp52
VThis is a project I did for the Sundance Film Festival.
p53
aVReally simple idea: you take every Academy Award Best Picture,
p54
aVyou speed it up to one minute each
p55
aVand string them all together.
p56
aVAnd so in 75 minutes, I can show you the history of Hollywood cinema.
p57
aVAnd what it really shows you is the history of editing
p58
aVin Hollywood cinema.
p59
aVSo on the left, we've got Casablanca; on the right, we've got Chicago.
p60
aVAnd you can see that Casablanca is a little easier to read.
p61
aVThat's because the average length of a cinematic shot in the 1940s
p62
aVwas 26 seconds,
p63
aVand now it's around six seconds.
p64
aa(lp65
VThis is a project that was inspired
p66
aVby some work that was funded by the US Federal Government
p67
aVin the early 2000s,
p68
aVto look at video footage and find a specific actor in any video.
p69
aVAnd so I repurposed this code to train a system on one person
p70
aVin our culture who would never need to be surveilled in that manner,
p71
aVwhich is Britney Spears.
p72
aVI downloaded 2,000 paparazzi photos of Britney Spears
p73
aVand trained my computer to find her face
p74
aVand her face alone.
p75
aVI can run any footage of her through it and will center her eyes in the frame,
p76
aVand this sort of is a little double commentary
p77
aVabout surveillance in our society.
p78
aVWe are very fraught with anxiety about being watched,
p79
aVbut then we obsess over celebrity.
p80
aa(lp81
VWhat you're seeing on the screen here is a collaboration I did
p82
aVwith an artist named Lián Amaris.
p83
aVWhat she did is very simple to explain and describe,
p84
aVbut very hard to do.
p85
aVShe took 72 minutes of activity,
p86
aVgetting ready for a night out on the town,
p87
aVand stretched it over three days
p88
aVand performed it on a traffic island in slow motion in New York City.
p89
aVI was there, too, with a film crew.
p90
aVWe filmed the whole thing,
p91
aVand then we reversed the process, speeding it up to 72 minutes again,
p92
aVso it looks like she's moving normally
p93
aVand the whole world is flying by.
p94
aa(lp95
VAt a certain point, I figured out
p96
aVthat what I was doing was making portraits.
p97
aVWhen you think about portraiture, you tend to think about stuff like this.
p98
aVThe guy on the left is named Gilbert Stuart.
p99
aVHe's sort of the first real portraitist of the United States.
p100
aVAnd on the right is his portrait of George Washington from 1796.
p101
aVThis is the so-called Lansdowne portrait.
p102
aVAnd if you look at this painting, there's a lot of symbolism, right?
p103
aVWe've got a rainbow out the window. We've got a sword.
p104
aVWe've got a quill on the desk.
p105
aVAll of these things are meant to evoke
p106
aVGeorge Washington as the father of the nation.
p107
aa(lp108
VThis is my portrait of George Washington.
p109
aVAnd this is an eye chart,
p110
aVonly instead of letters, they're words.
p111
aVAnd what the words are is the 66 words
p112
aVin George Washington's State of the Union addresses
p113
aVthat he uses more than any other president.
p114
aVSo "gentlemen" has its own symbolism and its own rhetoric.
p115
aVAnd it's really kind of significant that that's the word he used the most.
p116
aVThis is the eye chart for George W. Bush,
p117
aVwho was president when I made this piece.
p118
aVAnd how you get there,
p119
aVfrom "gentlemen" to "terror" in 43 easy steps,
p120
aVtells us a lot about American history,
p121
aVand gives you a different insight
p122
aVthan you would have looking at a series of paintings.
p123
aVThese pieces provide a history lesson of the United States
p124
aVthrough the political rhetoric of its leaders.
p125
aVRonald Reagan spent a lot of time talking about deficits.
p126
aVBill Clinton spent a lot of time
p127
aVtalking about the century in which he would no longer be president,
p128
aVbut maybe his wife would be.
p129
aVLyndon Johnson was the first President
p130
aVto give his State of the Union addresses on prime-time television;
p131
aVhe began every paragraph with the word "tonight."
p132
aVAnd Richard Nixon, or more accurately, his speechwriter,
p133
aVa guy named William Safire,
p134
aVspent a lot of time thinking about language
p135
aVand making sure that his boss portrayed a rhetoric of honesty.
p136
aa(lp137
VThis project is shown as a series of monolithic sculptures.
p138
aVIt's an outdoor series of light boxes.
p139
aVAnd it's important to note that they're to scale,
p140
aVso if you stand 20 feet back and you can read between those two black lines,
p141
aVyou have 20/20 vision.
p142
aa(lp143
V(Laughter)
p144
aa(lp145
VThis is a portrait. And there's a lot of these.
p146
aVThere's a lot of ways to do this with data.
p147
aVI started looking for a way
p148
aVto think about how I can do a more democratic form of portraiture,
p149
aVsomething that's more about my country and how it works.
p150
aVEvery 10 years, we make a census in the United States.
p151
aVWe literally count people,
p152
aVfind out who lives where, what kind of jobs we've got,
p153
aVthe language we speak at home.
p154
aVAnd this is important stuff \u2014 really important stuff.
p155
aVBut it doesn't really tell us who we are.
p156
aVIt doesn't tell us about our dreams and our aspirations.
p157
aa(lp158
VAnd so in 2010, I decided to make my own census.
p159
aVAnd I started looking for a corpus of data
p160
aVthat had a lot of descriptions written by ordinary Americans.
p161
aVAnd it turns out
p162
aVthat there is such a corpus of data
p163
aVthat's just sitting there for the taking.
p164
aVIt's called online dating.
p165
aa(lp166
VSo in 2010, I joined 21 different online dating services,
p167
aVas a gay man, a straight man, a gay woman and a straight woman,
p168
aVin every zip code in America
p169
aVand downloaded about 19 million people's dating profiles \u2014
p170
aVabout 20 percent of the adult population of the United States.
p171
aVI have obsessive-compulsive disorder.
p172
aVThis is going to become really freaking obvious. Just go with me.
p173
aa(lp174
V(Laughter)
p175
aa(lp176
VSo what I did was I sorted all this stuff by zip code.
p177
aVAnd I looked at word analysis.
p178
aVThese are some dating profiles from 2010
p179
aVwith the word "lonely" highlighted.
p180
aVIf you look at these things topographically,
p181
aVif you imagine dark colors to light colors are more use of the word,
p182
aVyou can see that Appalachia is a pretty lonely place.
p183
aVYou can also see that Nebraska ain't that funny.
p184
aVThis is the kinky map, so what this is showing you
p185
aVis that the women in Alaska need to get together
p186
aVwith the men in southern New Mexico,
p187
aVand have a good time.
p188
aVAnd I have this at a pretty granular level,
p189
aVso I can tell you that the men in the eastern half of Long Island
p190
aVare way more interested in being spanked
p191
aVthan men in the western half of Long Island.
p192
aVThis will be your one takeaway from this whole conference.
p193
aVYou're going to remember that fact for, like, 30 years.
p194
aa(lp195
V(Laughter)
p196
aa(lp197
VWhen you bring this down to a cartographic level,
p198
aVyou can make maps and do the same trick I was doing with the eye charts.
p199
aVYou can replace the name of every city in the United States
p200
aVwith the word people use more in that city than anywhere else.
p201
aVIf you've ever dated anyone from Seattle, this makes perfect sense.
p202
aVYou've got "pretty." You've got "heartbreak."
p203
aVYou've got "gig." You've got "cigarette."
p204
aVThey play in a band and they smoke.
p205
aVAnd right above that you can see "email."
p206
aVThat's Redmond, Washington,
p207
aVwhich is the headquarters of the Microsoft Corporation.
p208
aVSome of these you can guess \u2014 so, Los Angeles is "acting"
p209
aVand San Francisco is "gay."
p210
aVSome are a little bit more heartbreaking.
p211
aVIn Baton Rouge, they talk about being curvy;
p212
aVdownstream in New Orleans, they still talk about the flood.
p213
aVFolks in the American capital will say they're interesting.
p214
aVPeople in Baltimore, Maryland, will say they're afraid.
p215
aVThis is New Jersey.
p216
aVI grew up somewhere between "annoying" and "cynical."
p217
aa(lp218
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p219
aa(lp220
VAnd New York City's number one word is "now,"
p221
aVas in, "Now I'm working as a waiter, but actually I'm an actor."
p222
aa(lp223
V(Laughter)
p224
aa(lp225
VOr, "Now I'm a professor of engineering at NYU, but actually I'm an artist."
p226
aVIf you go upstate, you see "dinosaur."
p227
aVThat's Syracuse.
p228
aVThe best place to eat in Syracuse, New York,
p229
aVis a Hell's Angels barbecue joint called Dinosaur Barbecue.
p230
aVThat's where you would take somebody on a date.
p231
aVI live somewhere between "unconditional" and "midsummer," in Midtown Manhattan.
p232
aVAnd this is gentrified North Brooklyn,
p233
aVso you've got "DJ" and "glamorous" and "hipsters" and "urbane."
p234
aVSo that's maybe a more democratic portrait.
p235
aVAnd the idea was, what if we made red-state and blue-state maps
p236
aVbased on what we want to do on a Friday night?
p237
aa(lp238
VThis is a self-portrait.
p239
aVThis is based on my email,
p240
aVabout 500,000 emails sent over 20 years.
p241
aVYou can think of this as a quantified selfie.
p242
aVSo what I'm doing is running a physics equation
p243
aVbased on my personal data.
p244
aVYou have to imagine everybody I've ever corresponded with.
p245
aVIt started out in the middle and it exploded with a big bang.
p246
aVAnd everybody has gravity to one another,
p247
aVgravity based on how much they've been emailing,
p248
aVwho they've been emailing with.
p249
aVAnd it also does sentimental analysis,
p250
aVso if I say "I love you," you're heavier to me.
p251
aVAnd you attract to my email addresses in the middle,
p252
aVwhich act like mainline stars.
p253
aVAnd all the names are handwritten.
p254
aa(lp255
VSometimes you do this data and this work with real-time data
p256
aVto illuminate a specific problem in a specific city.
p257
aVThis is a Walther PPK 9mm semiautomatic handgun
p258
aVthat was used in a shooting in the French Quarter of New Orleans
p259
aVabout two years ago on Valentine's Day in an argument over parking.
p260
aVThose are my cigarettes.
p261
aVThis is the house where the shooting took place.
p262
aVThis project involved a little bit of engineering.
p263
aVI've got a bike chain rigged up as a cam shaft,
p264
aVwith a computer driving it.
p265
aVThat computer and the mechanism are buried in a box.
p266
aVThe gun's on top welded to a steel plate.
p267
aVThere's a wire going through to the trigger,
p268
aVand the computer in the box is online.
p269
aVIt's listening to the 911 feed of the New Orleans Police Department,
p270
aVso that anytime there's a shooting reported in New Orleans,
p271
aa(lp272
V(Gunshot sound)
p273
aa(lp274
Vthe gun fires.
p275
aVNow, there's a blank, so there's no bullet.
p276
aVThere's big light, big noise
p277
aVand most importantly, there's a casing.
p278
aVThere's about five shootings a day in New Orleans,
p279
aVso over the four months this piece was installed,
p280
aVthe case filled up with bullets.
p281
aVYou guys know what this is \u2014 you call this "data visualization."
p282
aVWhen you do it right, it's illuminating.
p283
aVWhen you do it wrong, it's anesthetizing.
p284
aVIt reduces people to numbers.
p285
aVSo watch out.
p286
aa(lp287
VOne last piece for you.
p288
aVI spent the last summer as the artist in residence
p289
aVfor Times Square.
p290
aVAnd Times Square in New York is literally the crossroads of the world.
p291
aVOne of the things people don't notice about it
p292
aVis it's the most Instagrammed place on Earth.
p293
aVAbout every five seconds, someone commits a selfie
p294
aVin Times Square.
p295
aVThat's 17,000 a day, and I have them all.
p296
aa(lp297
V(Laughter)
p298
aa(lp299
VThese are some of them with their eyes centered.
p300
aa(lp301
VEvery civilization,
p302
aVwill use the maximum level of technology available to make art.
p303
aVAnd it's the responsibility of the artist to ask questions
p304
aVabout what that technology means
p305
aVand how it reflects our culture.
p306
aa(lp307
VSo I leave you with this: we're more than numbers.
p308
aVWe're people, and we have dreams and ideas.
p309
aVAnd reducing us to statistics is something that's done
p310
aVat our peril.
p311
aa(lp312
VThank you very much.
