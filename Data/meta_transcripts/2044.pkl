VWhen I was preparing for this talk,
p4
aVI went to search for a couple of quotes
p5
aVthat I can share with you.
p6
aVGood news: I found three
p7
aVthat I particularly liked,
p8
aVthe first by Samuel Johnson, who said,
p9
aV"When making your choice in life,
p10
aVdo not forget to live,"
p11
aVthe second by Aeschylus, who reminded us that
p12
aV"happiness is a choice that requires effort,"
p13
aVand the third is one by Groucho Marx
p14
aVwho said, "I wouldn't want to choose to belong
p15
aVto any club that would have me as a member."
p16
aa(lp17
VNow, bad news:
p18
aVI didn't know which one of these quotes
p19
aVto choose and share with you.
p20
aVThe sweet anxiety of choice.
p21
aa(lp22
VIn today's times of post-industrial capitalism,
p23
aVchoice, together with individual freedom
p24
aVand the idea of self-making,
p25
aVhas been elevated to an ideal.
p26
aVNow, together with this, we also have a belief
p27
aVin endless progress.
p28
aVBut the underside of this ideology
p29
aVhas been an increase of anxiety,
p30
aVfeelings of guilt,
p31
aVfeelings of being inadequate,
p32
aVfeeling that we are failing in our choices.
p33
aVSadly, this ideology of individual choice
p34
aVhas prevented us from thinking about social changes.
p35
aVIt appears that this ideology was actually
p36
aVvery efficient in pacifying us
p37
aVas political and social thinkers.
p38
aVInstead of making social critiques,
p39
aVwe are more and more engaging in self-critique,
p40
aVsometimes to the point of self-destruction.
p41
aa(lp42
VNow, how come that ideology of choice
p43
aVis still so powerful,
p44
aVeven among people who have
p45
aVnot many things to choose among?
p46
aVHow come that even people who are poor
p47
aVvery much still identify with the idea of choice,
p48
aVthe kind of rational idea of choice
p49
aVwhich we embrace?
p50
aa(lp51
VNow, the ideology of choice is very successful
p52
aVin opening for us a space to think
p53
aVabout some imagined future.
p54
aVLet me give you an example.
p55
aVMy friend Manya,
p56
aVwhen she was a student at university in California,
p57
aVwas earning money
p58
aVby working for a car dealer.
p59
aVNow, Manya, when she encountered
p60
aVthe typical customer, would debate with him
p61
aVabout his lifestyle,
p62
aVhow much he wants to spend,
p63
aVhow many children he has,
p64
aVwhat does he need the car for?
p65
aVThey would usually come to a good conclusion
p66
aVwhat would be a perfect car.
p67
aVNow, before Manya's customer would go home
p68
aVand think things through,
p69
aVshe would say to him,
p70
aV"The car that you are buying now is perfect,
p71
aVbut in a few year's time,
p72
aVwhen your kids will be already out of the house,
p73
aVwhen you will have a little bit more money,
p74
aVthat other car will be ideal.
p75
aVBut what you are buying now is great."
p76
aVNow, the majority of Manya's customers
p77
aVwho came back the next day
p78
aVbought that other car,
p79
aVthe car they did not need,
p80
aVthe car that cost far too much money.
p81
aVNow, Manya became so successful in selling cars
p82
aVthat soon she moved on to selling airplanes.
p83
aV(Laughter)
p84
aVAnd knowing so much about the psychology of people
p85
aVprepared her well for her current job,
p86
aVwhich is that of a psychoanalyst.
p87
aa(lp88
VNow, why were Manya's customers so irrational?
p89
aVManya's success was that she was able
p90
aVto open in their heads an image
p91
aVof an idealized future,
p92
aVan image of themselves
p93
aVwhen they are already more successful, freer,
p94
aVand for them, choosing that other car
p95
aVwas as if they are coming closer to this ideal
p96
aVin which it was as if Manya already saw them.
p97
aa(lp98
VNow, we rarely make really totally rational choices.
p99
aVChoices are influenced by our unconscious,
p100
aVby our community.
p101
aVWe're often choosing
p102
aVby guessing, what would other people
p103
aVthink about our choice?
p104
aVAlso we are choosing
p105
aVby looking at what others are choosing.
p106
aVWe're also guessing what is socially acceptable choice.
p107
aVNow, because of this, we actually
p108
aVeven after we have already chosen,
p109
aVlike bought a car,
p110
aVendlessly read reviews about cars,
p111
aVas if we still want to convince ourselves
p112
aVthat we made the right choice.
p113
aa(lp114
VNow, choices are anxiety-provoking.
p115
aVThey are linked to risks, losses.
p116
aVThey are highly unpredictable.
p117
aVNow, because of this,
p118
aVpeople have now more and more problems
p119
aVthat they are not choosing anything.
p120
aVNot long ago, I was at a wedding reception,
p121
aVand I met a young, beautiful woman
p122
aVwho immediately started telling me about her anxiety over choice.
p123
aVShe said to me, "I needed one month
p124
aVto decide which dress to wear."
p125
aVThen she said, "For weeks I was researching
p126
aVwhich hotel to stay for this one night.
p127
aVAnd now, I need to choose a sperm donor."
p128
aV(Laughter)
p129
aVI looked at this woman in shock.
p130
aV"Sperm donor? What's the rush?"
p131
aVShe said, "I'm turning 40 at the end of this year,
p132
aVand I've been so bad in choosing men in my life."
p133
aa(lp134
VNow choice, because it's linked to risk,
p135
aVis anxiety-provoking,
p136
aVand it was already the famous
p137
aVDanish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard
p138
aVwho pointed out that anxiety
p139
aVis linked to the possibility of possibility.
p140
aVNow, we think today that we can prevent these risks.
p141
aVWe have endless market analysis,
p142
aVprojections of the future earnings.
p143
aVEven with market, which is about chance,
p144
aVrandomness, we think we can predict rationally
p145
aVwhere it's going.
p146
aa(lp147
VNow, chance is actually becoming very traumatic.
p148
aVLast year, my friend Bernard Harcourt
p149
aVat the University of Chicago organized an event,
p150
aVa conference on the idea of chance.
p151
aVHe and I were together on the panel,
p152
aVand just before delivering our papers \u2014
p153
aVwe didn't know each other's papers \u2014
p154
aVwe decided to take chance seriously.
p155
aVSo we informed our audience
p156
aVthat what they will just now hear
p157
aVwill be a random paper,
p158
aVa mixture of the two papers
p159
aVwhich we didn't know what each was writing.
p160
aVNow, we delivered the conference in such a way.
p161
aVBernard read his first paragraph,
p162
aVI read my first paragraph,
p163
aVBernard read his second paragraph,
p164
aVI read my second paragraph,
p165
aVin this way towards the end of our papers.
p166
aVNow, you will be surprised
p167
aVthat a majority of our audience
p168
aVdid not think that what they'd just listened to
p169
aVwas a completely random paper.
p170
aVThey couldn't believe that
p171
aVspeaking from the position of authority
p172
aVlike two professors we were,
p173
aVwe would take chance seriously.
p174
aVThey thought we prepared the papers together
p175
aVand were just joking that it's random.
p176
aa(lp177
VNow, we live in times with a lot of information,
p178
aVbig data,
p179
aVa lot of knowledge about the insides of our bodies.
p180
aVWe decoded our genome.
p181
aVWe know about our brains more than before.
p182
aVBut surprisingly, people are more and more
p183
aVturning a blind eye in front of this knowledge.
p184
aVIgnorance and denial are on the rise.
p185
aVNow, in regard to the current economic crisis,
p186
aVwe think that we will just wake up again
p187
aVand everything will be the same as before,
p188
aVand no political or social changes are needed.
p189
aVIn regard to ecological crisis,
p190
aVwe think nothing needs to be done just now,
p191
aVor others need to act before us.
p192
aVOr even when ecological crisis already happens,
p193
aVlike a catastrophe in Fukushima,
p194
aVoften we have people living in the same environment
p195
aVwith the same amount of information,
p196
aVand half of them will be anxious about radiation
p197
aVand half of them will ignore it.
p198
aa(lp199
VNow, psychoanalysts know very well
p200
aVthat people surprisingly don't have
p201
aVpassion for knowledge
p202
aVbut passion for ignorance.
p203
aVNow, what does that mean?
p204
aVLet's say when we are facing
p205
aVa life-threatening illness,
p206
aVa lot of people don't want to know that.
p207
aVThey'd rather prefer denying the illness,
p208
aVwhich is why it's not so wise to inform them
p209
aVif they don't ask.
p210
aVSurprisingly, research shows that sometimes
p211
aVpeople who deny their illness
p212
aVlive longer than those who are rationally choosing
p213
aVthe best treatment.
p214
aa(lp215
VNow, this ignorance, however,
p216
aVis not very helpful on the level of the social.
p217
aVWhen we are ignorant about where we are heading,
p218
aVa lot of social damage can be caused.
p219
aa(lp220
VNow, on top of facing ignorance,
p221
aVwe are also facing today
p222
aVsome kind of an obviousness.
p223
aVNow, it was French philosopher
p224
aVLouis Althusser who pointed out
p225
aVthat ideology functions in such a way
p226
aVthat it creates a veil of obviousness.
p227
aVBefore we do any social critique,
p228
aVit is necessary really to lift that veil of obviousness
p229
aVand to think through a little bit differently.
p230
aVIf we go back to this ideology
p231
aVof individual, rational choice
p232
aVwe often embrace,
p233
aVit's necessary precisely here
p234
aVto lift this obviousness
p235
aVand to think a little bit differently.
p236
aa(lp237
VNow for me, a question often is
p238
aVwhy we still embrace this idea of a self-made man
p239
aVon which capitalism relied from its beginning?
p240
aVWhy do we think that we are really such masters
p241
aVof our lives that we can rationally
p242
aVmake the best ideal choices,
p243
aVthat we don't accept losses and risks?
p244
aVAnd for me, it's very shocking to see sometimes very poor people,
p245
aVfor example, not supporting the idea
p246
aVof the rich being taxed more.
p247
aVQuite often here they still identify
p248
aVwith a certain kind of a lottery mentality.
p249
aVOkay, maybe they don't think that they will make it
p250
aVin the future, but maybe they think,
p251
aVmy son might become the next Bill Gates.
p252
aVAnd who would want to tax one's son?
p253
aVOr, a question for me is also,
p254
aVwhy would people who have no health insurance
p255
aVnot embrace universal healthcare?
p256
aVSometimes they don't embrace it,
p257
aVagain identifying with the idea of choice,
p258
aVbut they have nothing to choose from.
p259
aa(lp260
VNow, Margaret Thatcher famously said
p261
aVthat there is nothing like a society.
p262
aVSociety doesn't exist, it is only individuals
p263
aVand their families.
p264
aVSadly, this ideology still functions very well,
p265
aVwhich is why people who are poor might feel
p266
aVashamed for their poverty.
p267
aVWe might endlessly feel guilty that we are
p268
aVnot making the right choices,
p269
aVand that's why we didn't succeed.
p270
aVWe are anxious that we are not good enough.
p271
aVThat's why we work very hard,
p272
aVlong hours at the workplace
p273
aVand equally long hours on remaking ourselves.
p274
aVNow, when we are anxious over choices,
p275
aVsometimes we easily give our power of choice away.
p276
aVWe identify with the guru
p277
aVwho tells us what to do,
p278
aVself-help therapist,
p279
aVor we embrace a totalitarian leader
p280
aVwho appears to have no doubts about choices,
p281
aVwho sort of knows.
p282
aa(lp283
VNow, often people ask me,
p284
aV"What did you learn by studying choice?"
p285
aVAnd there is an important message that I did learn.
p286
aVWhen thinking about choices,
p287
aVI stopped taking choices too seriously, personally.
p288
aVFirst, I realized a lot of choice I make
p289
aVis not rational.
p290
aVIt's linked to my unconscious,
p291
aVmy guesses of what others are choosing,
p292
aVor what is a socially embraced choice.
p293
aVI also embrace the idea
p294
aVthat we should go beyond
p295
aVthinking about individual choices,
p296
aVthat it's very important to rethink social choices,
p297
aVsince this ideology of individual choice has pacified us.
p298
aVIt really prevented us to think about social change.
p299
aVWe spend so much time choosing things for ourselves
p300
aVand barely reflect on
p301
aVcommunal choices we can make.
p302
aa(lp303
VNow, we should not forget that choice
p304
aVis always linked to change.
p305
aVWe can make individual changes,
p306
aVbut we can make social changes.
p307
aVWe can choose to have more wolves.
p308
aVWe can choose to change our environment
p309
aVto have more bees.
p310
aVWe can choose to have different rating agencies.
p311
aVWe can choose to control corporations
p312
aVinstead of allowing corporations to control us.
p313
aVWe have a possibility to make changes.
p314
aa(lp315
VNow, I started with a quote from Samuel Johnson,
p316
aVwho said that when we make choice in life,
p317
aVwe shouldn't forget to live.
p318
aVFinally, you can see
p319
aVI did have a choice
p320
aVto choose one of the three quotes
p321
aVwith which I wanted to start my lecture.
p322
aVI did have a choice,
p323
aVsuch as nations, as people,
p324
aVwe have choices too to rethink
p325
aVin what kind of society we want to live in the future.
p326
aa(lp327
VThank you.
