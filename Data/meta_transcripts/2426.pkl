VHello.
p4
aVMy name is Matthew Williams,
p5
aVand I am a champion.
p6
aVI have won medals in three different sports
p7
aVand national games in Canada,
p8
aVcompeted at the international level in basketball
p9
aVand was proud to represent Canada
p10
aVon the world stage.
p11
aa(lp12
V(Applause)
p13
aa(lp14
VI train five days a week for basketball and speed skating,
p15
aVwork with top quality coaches
p16
aVand mental performance consultants
p17
aVto be at my best in my sport.
p18
aVBy the way, all that is through Special Olympics.
p19
aVDoes that change the way you think of me
p20
aVand my accomplishments?
p21
aa(lp22
VThe world does not see all people like me as champions.
p23
aVNot long ago, people like me were shunned and hidden away.
p24
aVThere has been lots of change since Special Olympics began in 1968,
p25
aVbut in too many cases,
p26
aVpeople with intellectual disabilities
p27
aVare invisible to the wider population.
p28
aVPeople use the r-word in front of me, and they think it doesn't matter.
p29
aVThat's the word "retard" or "retarded"
p30
aVused in a derogatory manner.
p31
aVThey're not thinking about how much it hurts me and my friends.
p32
aa(lp33
VI don't want you to think I'm here because I'm a charity case.
p34
aVI am here because there is still a big problem with the way
p35
aVmany people see individuals with intellectual disabilities,
p36
aVor, too often,
p37
aVhow they don't see them at all.
p38
aa(lp39
VDid you know the World Games happened this year?
p40
aVI was one of over 6,500 athletes with intellectual disabilities
p41
aVfrom 165 countries who competed in LA.
p42
aVThere was over 62,000 spectators watching opening ceremonies,
p43
aVand there was live coverage on TSN and ESPN.
p44
aVDid you even know that happened?
p45
aa(lp46
VWhat do you think of when you see someone like me?
p47
aVI am here today to challenge you
p48
aVto look at us as equals.
p49
aa(lp50
VSpecial Olympics transforms the self-identity of athletes
p51
aVwith intellectual disabilities
p52
aVand the perceptions of everyone watching.
p53
aVFor those of you who aren't familiar,
p54
aVSpecial Olympics is for athletes with intellectual disabilities.
p55
aVSpecial Olympics is separate from the Paralympics and Olympics.
p56
aVWe offer high-quality, year round sports programs
p57
aVfor people with intellectual disabilities
p58
aVthat changes lives and perceptions.
p59
aVThis movement has changed my life
p60
aVand those of so many others.
p61
aVAnd it has changed the way
p62
aVthe world sees people with intellectual disabilities.
p63
aa(lp64
VI was born with epilepsy and an intellectual disability.
p65
aVGrowing up, I played hockey until I was 12 years old.
p66
aVThe older I got, the more I felt
p67
aVit was harder to keep up with everyone else,
p68
aVand I was angry and frustrated.
p69
aVFor a while, I did not play any sports,
p70
aVdidn't have many friends
p71
aVand felt left out and sad.
p72
aa(lp73
VThere was a time when people with intellectual disabilities
p74
aVwere hidden away from society.
p75
aVNo one thought they could participate in sports,
p76
aVlet alone be a valued member of society.
p77
aVIn the 1960s, Dr. Frank Hayden,
p78
aVa scientist at the University of Toronto,
p79
aVwas studying the effects of regular exercise
p80
aVon the fitness levels of children with intellectual disabilities.
p81
aVUsing rigorous scientific research,
p82
aVDr. Hayden and other researchers
p83
aVcame to the conclusion
p84
aVthat it was simply the lack of opportunity to participate
p85
aVthat caused their fitness levels to suffer.
p86
aa(lp87
VLots of people doubted that people with intellectual disabilities
p88
aVcould benefit from fitness programs
p89
aVand sports competition opportunities.
p90
aVBut pioneers like Dr. Hayden and Eunice Kennedy Shriver,
p91
aVthe founder of Special Olympics,
p92
aVpersevered,
p93
aVand Special Olympics athletes have proved them right
p94
aVfour and a half million times over.
p95
aa(lp96
V(Applause)
p97
aa(lp98
VBefore I joined Special Olympics,
p99
aVI was nervous
p100
aVbecause I was young, shy, not confident
p101
aVand didn't have many friends.
p102
aVWhen I got there, though, everyone was very encouraging,
p103
aVsupportive, and let me be myself
p104
aVwithout being judged.
p105
aVNow, I am a basketball player and speed skater
p106
aVwho has competed at provincial, national games,
p107
aVand this year made it all the way to the World Summer Games in LA,
p108
aVwhere I was part of the first ever Canadian basketball team
p109
aVto compete at World Games.
p110
aa(lp111
V(Applause)
p112
aa(lp113
VI am one of more than four and a half million athletes around the globe,
p114
aVand I've heard so many similar stories.
p115
aVBeing Special Olympics athletes
p116
aVrestores our pride and dignity.
p117
aa(lp118
VSpecial Olympics also addresses critical health needs.
p119
aVStudies have shown that, on average,
p120
aVmen with intellectual disabilities
p121
aVdie 13 years younger than men without,
p122
aVand women with intellectual disabilities
p123
aVdie 20 years younger than women without.
p124
aVSpecial Olympics keeps us healthy
p125
aVby getting us active
p126
aVand participating in sport.
p127
aVAlso, our coaches teach us about nutrition and health.
p128
aVSpecial Olympics also provides free health screening
p129
aVfor athletes who have difficulty communicating with their doctor
p130
aVor accessing health care.
p131
aa(lp132
VAt the 2015 World Summer Games,
p133
aVmy Team Canada teammates and I played the Nigerian basketball team.
p134
aVThe day before our game,
p135
aVthe Nigerian basketball team went to the World Games Healthy Athlete screening,
p136
aVwhere seven of 10 members
p137
aVwere given hearing aids for free
p138
aVand got to hear clearly for the first time.
p139
aa(lp140
V(Applause)
p141
aa(lp142
VThe change in them was amazing.
p143
aVThey were more excited, happy and confident,
p144
aVbecause their coach could vocally communicate with them.
p145
aVAnd they were emotional
p146
aVbecause they could hear the sounds of the basketball,
p147
aVthe sounds of the whistle
p148
aVand the cheering fans in the stands \u2014
p149
aVsounds that we take for granted.
p150
aVSpecial Olympics is transforming more than just the athlete in their sport.
p151
aVSpecial Olympics is transforming their lives off the field.
p152
aVThis year, research findings showed
p153
aVthat nearly half of the adults in the US
p154
aVdon't know a single person with an intellectual disability,
p155
aVand the 44 percent of Americans
p156
aVwho don't have personal contact with intellectual disabilities
p157
aVare significantly less accepting and positive.
p158
aa(lp159
VThen there's the r-word,
p160
aVproving that people with intellectual disabilities
p161
aVare still invisible
p162
aVto far too many people.
p163
aVPeople use it as a casual term or an insult.
p164
aVIt was tweeted more than nine million times last year,
p165
aVand it is deeply hurtful
p166
aVto me and my four and a half million fellow athletes around the planet.
p167
aVPeople don't think it's insulting,
p168
aVbut it is.
p169
aVAs my fellow athlete and global messenger John Franklin Stephens wrote
p170
aVin an open letter to a political pundit
p171
aVwho used the r-word as an insult,
p172
aV"Come join us someday at Special Olympics.
p173
aVSee if you walk away with your heart unchanged."
p174
aa(lp175
V(Applause)
p176
aa(lp177
VThis year, at the 2015 World Summer Games,
p178
aVpeople lined up for hours
p179
aVto get into the final night of powerlifting competition.
p180
aVSo it was standing room only when my teammate Jackie Barrett,
p181
aVthe Newfoundland Moose,
p182
aVdeadlifted 655 pounds
p183
aVand lifted 611 pounds in the squat \u2014
p184
aa(lp185
V(Applause)
p186
aa(lp187
Vsetting huge new records for Special Olympics.
p188
aVJackie is a record holder among all powerlifters in Newfoundland \u2014
p189
aVnot just Special Olympics, all powerlifters.
p190
aVJackie was a huge star in LA,
p191
aVand ESPN live-tweeted his record-breaking lifts
p192
aVand were wowed by his performance.
p193
aa(lp194
VFifty years ago, few imagined individuals with intellectual disabilities
p195
aVcould do anything like that.
p196
aVThis year, 60,000 spectators filled the famous LA Memorial Coliseum
p197
aVto watch the opening ceremonies of World Games
p198
aVand cheer athletes from 165 countries
p199
aVaround the world.
p200
aVFar from being hidden away,
p201
aVwe were cheered and celebrated.
p202
aVSpecial Olympics teaches athletes
p203
aVto be confident and proud of themselves.
p204
aVSpecial Olympics teaches the world
p205
aVthat people with intellectual disabilities
p206
aVdeserve respect and inclusion.
p207
aa(lp208
V(Applause)
p209
aa(lp210
VNow, I have dreams and achievements in my sport,
p211
aVgreat coaches,
p212
aVrespect and dignity,
p213
aVbetter health,
p214
aVand I am pursuing a career as a personal trainer.
p215
aa(lp216
V(Applause)
p217
aa(lp218
VI am no longer hidden, bullied
p219
aVand I am here doing a TED Talk.
p220
aa(lp221
V(Applause)
p222
aa(lp223
VThe world is a different place because of Special Olympics,
p224
aVbut there is still farther to go.
p225
aVSo the next time you see someone with an intellectual disability,
p226
aVI hope you will see their ability.
p227
aVThe next time someone uses the r-word near you,
p228
aVI hope you will tell them how much it hurts.
p229
aVI hope you will think about getting involved with Special Olympics.
p230
aa(lp231
V(Applause)
p232
aa(lp233
VI would like to leave you with one final thought.
p234
aVNelson Mandela said,
p235
aV"Sports has the power to change the world."
p236
aVSpecial Olympics is changing the world
p237
aVby transforming four and a half million athletes
p238
aVand giving us a place to be confident,
p239
aVmeet friends,
p240
aVnot be judged
p241
aVand get to feel like and be champions.
