VDo you ever think about how important the oceans are in our daily lives?
p4
aVThe oceans cover two-thirds of our planet.
p5
aVThey provide half the oxygen we breathe.
p6
aVThey moderate our climate.
p7
aVAnd they provide jobs and medicine and food
p8
aVincluding 20 percent of protein to feed the entire world population.
p9
aVPeople used to think that the oceans were so vast
p10
aVthat they wouldn't be affected by human activities.
p11
aa(lp12
VWell today I'm going to tell you about a serious reality
p13
aVthat is changing our oceans called ocean acidification,
p14
aVor the evil twin of climate change.
p15
aVDid you know that the oceans have absorbed 25 percent of all of the carbon dioxide
p16
aVthat we have emitted to the atmosphere?
p17
aVNow this is just another great service provided by the oceans
p18
aVsince carbon dioxide is one of the greenhouse gases
p19
aVthat's causing climate change.
p20
aVBut as we keep pumping more and more and more
p21
aVcarbon dioxide into the atmosphere
p22
aVmore is dissolving into the oceans.
p23
aVAnd this is what's changing our ocean chemistry.
p24
aVWhen carbon dioxide dissolves in seawater,
p25
aVit undergoes a number of chemical reactions.
p26
aa(lp27
VNow lucky for you,
p28
aVI don't have time to get into the details of the chemistry for today.
p29
aVBut I'll tell you as more carbon dioxide enters the ocean,
p30
aVthe seawater pH goes down.
p31
aVAnd this basically means that there is an increase in ocean acidity.
p32
aVAnd this whole process is called ocean acidification.
p33
aVAnd it's happening alongside climate change.
p34
aVScientists have been monitoring ocean acidification for over two decades.
p35
aVThis figure is an important time series in Hawaii,
p36
aVand the top line shows steadily increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide,
p37
aVor CO2 gas, in the atmosphere.
p38
aVAnd this is directly as a result of human activities.
p39
aVThe line underneath shows the increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide
p40
aVthat is dissolved in the surface of the ocean
p41
aVwhich you can see is increasing at the same rate
p42
aVas carbon dioxide in the atmosphere since measurements began.
p43
aVThe line on the bottom shows then shows the change in chemistry.
p44
aVAs more carbon dioxide has entered the ocean,
p45
aVthe seawater pH has gone down,
p46
aVwhich basically means there has been an increase in ocean acidity.
p47
aVNow in Ireland, scientists are also monitoring ocean acidification \u2014
p48
aVscientists at the Marine Institute and NUI Galway.
p49
aVAnd we, too, are seeing acidification at the same rate
p50
aVas these main ocean time-series sites around the world.
p51
aVSo it's happening right at our doorstep.
p52
aa(lp53
VNow I'd like to give you an example of just how we collect our data
p54
aVto monitor a changing ocean.
p55
aVFirstly we collect a lot of our samples in the middle of winter.
p56
aVSo as you can imagine, in the North Atlantic
p57
aVwe get hit with some seriously stormy conditions \u2014
p58
aVso not for any of you who get a little motion sickness,
p59
aVbut we are collecting some very valuable data.
p60
aVSo we lower this instrument over the side of the ship,
p61
aVand there are sensors that are mounted on the bottom
p62
aVthat can tell us information about the surrounding water,
p63
aVsuch as temperature or dissolved oxygen.
p64
aVAnd then we can collect our seawater samples in these large bottles.
p65
aVSo we start at the bottom, which can be over four kilometers deep
p66
aVjust off our continental shelf,
p67
aVand we take samples at regular intervals right up to the surface.
p68
aVWe take the seawater back on the deck,
p69
aVand then we can either analyze them on the ship
p70
aVor back in the laboratory for the different chemicals parameters.
p71
aa(lp72
VBut why should we care?
p73
aVHow is ocean acidification going to affect all of us?
p74
aVWell, here are the worrying facts.
p75
aVThere has already been an increase in ocean acidity of 26 percent
p76
aVsince pre-industrial times, which is directly due to human activities.
p77
aVUnless we can start slowing down our carbon dioxide emissions,
p78
aVwe're expecting an increase in ocean acidity of 170 percent
p79
aVby the end of this century.
p80
aVI mean this is within our children's lifetime.
p81
aVThis rate of acidification is 10 times faster
p82
aVthan any acidification in our oceans for over 55 million years.
p83
aVSo our marine life have never, ever experienced
p84
aVsuch a fast rate of change before.
p85
aVSo we literally could not know how they're going to cope.
p86
aa(lp87
VNow there was a natural acidification event millions of years ago,
p88
aVwhich was much slower than what we're seeing today.
p89
aVAnd this coincided with a mass extinction of many marine species.
p90
aVSo is that what we're headed for?
p91
aVWell, maybe.
p92
aVStudies are showing some species are actually doing quite well
p93
aVbut many are showing a negative response.
p94
aVOne of the big concerns is as ocean acidity increases,
p95
aVthe concentration of carbonate ions in seawater decrease.
p96
aVNow these ions are basically the building blocks
p97
aVfor many marine species to make their shells,
p98
aVfor example crabs or mussels, oysters.
p99
aa(lp100
VAnother example are corals.
p101
aVThey also need these carbonate ions in seawater
p102
aVto make their coral structure in order to build coral reefs.
p103
aVAs ocean acidity increases
p104
aVand the concentration of carbonate ions decrease,
p105
aVthese species first find it more difficult to make their shells.
p106
aVAnd at even even lower levels, they can actually begin to dissolve.
p107
aa(lp108
VThis here is a pteropod, it's called a sea butterfly.
p109
aVAnd it's an important food source in the ocean for many species,
p110
aVfrom krill to salmon right up to whales.
p111
aVThe shell of the pteropod was placed into seawater
p112
aVat a pH that we're expecting by the end of this century.
p113
aVAfter only 45 days at this very realistic pH,
p114
aVyou can see the shell has almost completely dissolved.
p115
aVSo ocean acidification could affect right up through the food chain \u2014
p116
aVand right onto our dinner plates.
p117
aVI mean who here likes shellfish? Or salmon?
p118
aVOr many other fish species
p119
aVwhose food source in the ocean could be affected?
p120
aa(lp121
VThese are cold-water corals.
p122
aVAnd did you know we actually have cold-water corals in Irish waters,
p123
aVjust off our continental shelf?
p124
aVAnd they support rich biodiversity, including some very important fisheries.
p125
aVIt's projected that by the end of this century,
p126
aV70 percent of all known cold-water corals in the entire ocean
p127
aVwill be surrounded by seawater that is dissolving their coral structure.
p128
aVThe last example I have are these healthy tropical corals.
p129
aVThey were placed in seawater at a pH we're expecting by the year 2100.
p130
aVAfter six months, the coral has almost completely dissolved.
p131
aVNow coral reefs support
p132
aV25 percent of all marine life in the entire ocean.
p133
aVAll marine life.
p134
aa(lp135
VSo you can see: ocean acidification is a global threat.
p136
aVI have an eight-month-old baby boy.
p137
aVUnless we start now to slow this down,
p138
aVI dread to think what our oceans will look like when he's a grown man.
p139
aVWe will see acidification.
p140
aVWe have already put too much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
p141
aVBut we can slow this down.
p142
aVWe can prevent the worst-case scenario.
p143
aVThe only way of doing that
p144
aVis by reducing our carbon dioxide emissions.
p145
aVThis is important for both you and I, for industry, for governments.
p146
aa(lp147
VWe need to work together, slow down global warming
p148
aVslow down ocean acidification
p149
aVand help to maintain a healthy ocean and a healthy planet
p150
aVfor our generation and for generations to come.
