VSo, has everybody heard of CRISPR?
p4
aVI would be shocked if you hadn't.
p5
aa(lp6
VThis is a technology \u2014 it's for genome editing \u2014
p7
aVand it's so versatile and so controversial
p8
aVthat it's sparking all sorts of really interesting conversations.
p9
aVShould we bring back the woolly mammoth?
p10
aVShould we edit a human embryo?
p11
aVAnd my personal favorite:
p12
aVHow can we justify wiping out an entire species
p13
aVthat we consider harmful to humans
p14
aVoff the face of the Earth,
p15
aVusing this technology?
p16
aa(lp17
VThis type of science is moving much faster
p18
aVthan the regulatory mechanisms that govern it.
p19
aVAnd so, for the past six years,
p20
aVI've made it my personal mission
p21
aVto make sure that as many people as possible understand
p22
aVthese types of technologies and their implications.
p23
aa(lp24
VNow, CRISPR has been the subject of a huge media hype,
p25
aVand the words that are used most often are "easy" and "cheap."
p26
aVSo what I want to do is drill down a little bit deeper
p27
aVand look into some of the myths and the realities around CRISPR.
p28
aa(lp29
VIf you're trying to CRISPR a genome,
p30
aVthe first thing that you have to do is damage the DNA.
p31
aVThe damage comes in the form of a double-strand break
p32
aVthrough the double helix.
p33
aVAnd then the cellular repair processes kick in,
p34
aVand then we convince those repair processes
p35
aVto make the edit that we want,
p36
aVand not a natural edit.
p37
aVThat's how it works.
p38
aVIt's a two-part system.
p39
aVYou've got a Cas9 protein and something called a guide RNA.
p40
aVI like to think of it as a guided missile.
p41
aVSo the Cas9 \u2014 I love to anthropomorphize \u2014
p42
aVso the Cas9 is kind of this Pac-Man thing
p43
aVthat wants to chew DNA,
p44
aVand the guide RNA is the leash that's keeping it out of the genome
p45
aVuntil it finds the exact spot where it matches.
p46
aVAnd the combination of those two is called CRISPR.
p47
aVIt's a system that we stole
p48
aVfrom an ancient, ancient bacterial immune system.
p49
aa(lp50
VThe part that's amazing about it is that the guide RNA,
p51
aVonly 20 letters of it,
p52
aVare what target the system.
p53
aVThis is really easy to design,
p54
aVand it's really cheap to buy.
p55
aVSo that's the part that is modular in the system;
p56
aVeverything else stays the same.
p57
aVThis makes it a remarkably easy and powerful system to use.
p58
aa(lp59
VThe guide RNA and the Cas9 protein complex together
p60
aVgo bouncing along the genome,
p61
aVand when they find a spot where the guide RNA matches,
p62
aVthen it inserts between the two strands of the double helix,
p63
aVit rips them apart,
p64
aVthat triggers the Cas9 protein to cut,
p65
aVand all of a sudden,
p66
aVyou've got a cell that's in total panic
p67
aVbecause now it's got a piece of DNA that's broken.
p68
aa(lp69
VWhat does it do?
p70
aVIt calls its first responders.
p71
aVThere are two major repair pathways.
p72
aVThe first just takes the DNA and shoves the two pieces back together.
p73
aVThis isn't a very efficient system,
p74
aVbecause what happens is sometimes a base drops out
p75
aVor a base is added.
p76
aVIt's an OK way to maybe, like, knock out a gene,
p77
aVbut it's not the way that we really want to do genome editing.
p78
aa(lp79
VThe second repair pathway is a lot more interesting.
p80
aVIn this repair pathway,
p81
aVit takes a homologous piece of DNA.
p82
aVAnd now mind you, in a diploid organism like people,
p83
aVwe've got one copy of our genome from our mom and one from our dad,
p84
aVso if one gets damaged,
p85
aVit can use the other chromosome to repair it.
p86
aVSo that's where this comes from.
p87
aVThe repair is made,
p88
aVand now the genome is safe again.
p89
aa(lp90
VThe way that we can hijack this
p91
aVis we can feed it a false piece of DNA,
p92
aVa piece that has homology on both ends
p93
aVbut is different in the middle.
p94
aVSo now, you can put whatever you want in the center
p95
aVand the cell gets fooled.
p96
aVSo you can change a letter,
p97
aVyou can take letters out,
p98
aVbut most importantly, you can stuff new DNA in,
p99
aVkind of like a Trojan horse.
p100
aa(lp101
VCRISPR is going to be amazing,
p102
aVin terms of the number of different scientific advances
p103
aVthat it's going to catalyze.
p104
aVThe thing that's special about it is this modular targeting system.
p105
aVI mean, we've been shoving DNA into organisms for years, right?
p106
aVBut because of the modular targeting system,
p107
aVwe can actually put it exactly where we want it.
p108
aa(lp109
VThe thing is that there's a lot of talk about it being cheap
p110
aVand it being easy.
p111
aVAnd I run a community lab.
p112
aVI'm starting to get emails from people that say stuff like,
p113
aa(lp114
V"Hey, can I come to your open night
p115
aVand, like, maybe use CRISPR and engineer my genome?"
p116
aa(lp117
V(Laugher)
p118
aa(lp119
VLike, seriously.
p120
aa(lp121
VI'm, "No, you can't."
p122
aa(lp123
V(Laughter)
p124
aa(lp125
V"But I've heard it's cheap. I've heard it's easy."
p126
aa(lp127
VWe're going to explore that a little bit.
p128
aVSo, how cheap is it?
p129
aVYeah, it is cheap in comparison.
p130
aVIt's going to take the cost of the average materials for an experiment
p131
aVfrom thousands of dollars to hundreds of dollars,
p132
aVand it cuts the time a lot, too.
p133
aVIt can cut it from weeks to days.
p134
aVThat's great.
p135
aVYou still need a professional lab to do the work in;
p136
aVyou're not going to do anything meaningful outside of a professional lab.
p137
aVI mean, don't listen to anyone who says
p138
aVyou can do this sort of stuff on your kitchen table.
p139
aVIt's really not easy to do this kind of work.
p140
aVNot to mention, there's a patent battle going on,
p141
aVso even if you do invent something,
p142
aVthe Broad Institute and UC Berkeley are in this incredible patent battle.
p143
aVIt's really fascinating to watch it happen,
p144
aVbecause they're accusing each other of fraudulent claims
p145
aVand then they've got people saying,
p146
aV"Oh, well, I signed my notebook here or there."
p147
aVThis isn't going to be settled for years.
p148
aVAnd when it is,
p149
aVyou can bet you're going to pay someone a really hefty licensing fee
p150
aVin order to use this stuff.
p151
aVSo, is it really cheap?
p152
aVWell, it's cheap if you're doing basic research and you've got a lab.
p153
aa(lp154
VHow about easy? Let's look at that claim.
p155
aVThe devil is always in the details.
p156
aVWe don't really know that much about cells.
p157
aVThey're still kind of black boxes.
p158
aVFor example, we don't know why some guide RNAs work really well
p159
aVand some guide RNAs don't.
p160
aVWe don't know why some cells want to do one repair pathway
p161
aVand some cells would rather do the other.
p162
aa(lp163
VAnd besides that,
p164
aVthere's the whole problem of getting the system into the cell
p165
aVin the first place.
p166
aVIn a petri dish, that's not that hard,
p167
aVbut if you're trying to do it on a whole organism,
p168
aVit gets really tricky.
p169
aVIt's OK if you use something like blood or bone marrow \u2014
p170
aVthose are the targets of a lot of research now.
p171
aa(lp172
VThere was a great story of some little girl
p173
aVwho they saved from leukemia
p174
aVby taking the blood out, editing it, and putting it back
p175
aVwith a precursor of CRISPR.
p176
aVAnd this is a line of research that people are going to do.
p177
aVBut right now, if you want to get into the whole body,
p178
aVyou're probably going to have to use a virus.
p179
aVSo you take the virus, you put the CRISPR into it,
p180
aVyou let the virus infect the cell.
p181
aVBut now you've got this virus in there,
p182
aVand we don't know what the long-term effects of that are.
p183
aVPlus, CRISPR has some off-target effects,
p184
aVa very small percentage, but they're still there.
p185
aVWhat's going to happen over time with that?
p186
aa(lp187
VThese are not trivial questions,
p188
aVand there are scientists that are trying to solve them,
p189
aVand they will eventually, hopefully, be solved.
p190
aVBut it ain't plug-and-play, not by a long shot.
p191
aVSo: Is it really easy?
p192
aVWell, if you spend a few years working it out in your particular system,
p193
aVyes, it is.
p194
aa(lp195
VNow the other thing is,
p196
aVwe don't really know that much about how to make a particular thing happen
p197
aVby changing particular spots in the genome.
p198
aVWe're a long way away from figuring out
p199
aVhow to give a pig wings, for example.
p200
aVOr even an extra leg \u2014 I'd settle for an extra leg.
p201
aVThat would be kind of cool, right?
p202
aVBut what is happening
p203
aVis that CRISPR is being used by thousands and thousands of scientists
p204
aVto do really, really important work,
p205
aVlike making better models of diseases in animals, for example,
p206
aVor for taking pathways that produce valuable chemicals
p207
aVand getting them into industrial production in fermentation vats,
p208
aVor even doing really basic research on what genes do.
p209
aa(lp210
VThis is the story of CRISPR we should be telling,
p211
aVand I don't like it that the flashier aspects of it
p212
aVare drowning all of this out.
p213
aVLots of scientists did a lot of work to make CRISPR happen,
p214
aVand what's interesting to me
p215
aVis that these scientists are being supported by our society.
p216
aa(lp217
VThink about it.
p218
aVWe've got an infrastructure that allows a certain percentage of people
p219
aVto spend all their time doing research.
p220
aVThat makes us all the inventors of CRISPR,
p221
aVand I would say that makes us all the shepherds of CRISPR.
p222
aVWe all have a responsibility.
p223
aa(lp224
VSo I would urge you to really learn about these types of technologies,
p225
aVbecause, really, only in that way
p226
aVare we going to be able to guide the development of these technologies,
p227
aVthe use of these technologies
p228
aVand make sure that, in the end, it's a positive outcome \u2014
p229
aVfor both the planet and for us.
p230
