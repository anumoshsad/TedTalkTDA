VAs a conceptual artist,
p4
aVI'm constantly looking for creative ways to spark challenging conversations.
p5
aVI do this though painting, sculpture, video and performance.
p6
aVBut regardless of the format,
p7
aVtwo of my favorite materials are history and dialogue.
p8
aa(lp9
VIn 2007, I created "Lotus,"
p10
aVa seven-and-a-half-foot diameter,
p11
aV600-pound glass depiction of a lotus blossom.
p12
aVIn Buddhism, the lotus is a symbol for transcendence
p13
aVand for purity of mind and spirit.
p14
aVBut a closer look at this lotus
p15
aVreveals each petal to be the cross-section of a slave ship.
p16
aVThis iconic diagram was taken from a British slaving manual
p17
aVand later used by abolitionists to show the atrocities of slavery.
p18
aVIn America, we don't like to talk about slavery,
p19
aVnor do we look at it as a global industry.
p20
aVBut by using this Buddhist symbol,
p21
aVI hope to universalize and transcend
p22
aVthe history and trauma of black America
p23
aVand encourage discussions about our shared past.
p24
aa(lp25
VTo create "Lotus," we carved over 6,000 figures.
p26
aVAnd this later led to a commission by the City of New York
p27
aVto create a 28-foot version in steel
p28
aVas a permanent installation at the Eagle Academy for Young Men,
p29
aVa school for black and latino students,
p30
aVthe two groups most affected by this history.
p31
aVThe same two groups are very affected by a more recent phenomenon,
p32
aVbut let me digress.
p33
aa(lp34
VI've been collecting wooden African figures
p35
aVfrom tourist shops and flea markets around the world.
p36
aVThe authenticity and origin of them is completely debatable,
p37
aVbut people believe these to be imbued with power,
p38
aVor even magic.
p39
aVOnly recently have I figured out how to use this in my own work.
p40
aa(lp41
V(Gun shots)
p42
aa(lp43
VSince 2012, the world has witnessed the killings of Trayvon Martin,
p44
aVMichael Brown, Eric Garner, Sandra Bland, Tamir Rice
p45
aVand literally countless other unarmed black citizens
p46
aVat the hands of the police,
p47
aVwho frequently walk away with no punishment at all.
p48
aVIn consideration of these victims
p49
aVand the several times that even I,
p50
aVa law-abiding, Ivy League professor,
p51
aVhave been targeted and harassed at gunpoint by the police.
p52
aVI created this body of work simply entitled "BAM."
p53
aa(lp54
VIt was important to erase the identity of each of these figures,
p55
aVto make them all look the same and easier to disregard.
p56
aVTo do this, I dip them in a thick, brown wax
p57
aVbefore taking them to a shooting range
p58
aVwhere I re-sculpted them using bullets.
p59
aVAnd it was fun,
p60
aVplaying with big guns and high-speed video cameras.
p61
aVBut my reverence for these figures kept me from actually pulling the trigger,
p62
aVsomehow feeling as if I would be shooting myself.
p63
aVFinally, my cameraman, Raul, fired the shots.
p64
aVI then took the fragments of these
p65
aVand created molds, and cast them first in wax,
p66
aVand finally in bronze like the image you see here,
p67
aVwhich bears the marks of its violent creation
p68
aVlike battle wounds or scars.
p69
aa(lp70
VWhen I showed this work recently in Miami,
p71
aVa woman told me she felt every gun shot to her soul.
p72
aVBut she also felt that these artworks
p73
aVmemorialized the victims of these killings
p74
aVas well as other victims of racial violence throughout US history.
p75
aa(lp76
VBut "Lotus" and "BAM" are larger than just US history.
p77
aVWhile showing in Berlin last year,
p78
aVa philosophy student asked me what prompted these recent killings.
p79
aVI showed him a photo of a lynching postcard
p80
aVfrom the early 1900s
p81
aVand reminded him that these killings have been going on for over 500 years.
p82
aVBut it's only through questions like his
p83
aVand more thoughtful dialogue about history and race
p84
aVcan we evolve as individuals and society.
p85
aa(lp86
VI hope my artwork creates a safe space
p87
aVfor this type of honest exchange
p88
aVand an opportunity for people to engage one another
p89
aVin real and necessary conversation.

VThank you.
