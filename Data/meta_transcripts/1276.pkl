VI'd like to apologize, first of all, to all of you
p4
aVbecause I have no form
p5
aVof PowerPoint presentation.
p6
aVSo what I'm going to do
p7
aVis, every now and again, I will make this gesture,
p8
aVand in a moment of PowerPoint democracy,
p9
aVyou can imagine what you'd like to see.
p10
aa(lp11
VI do a radio show.
p12
aVThe radio show is called "The Infinite Monkey Cage."
p13
aVIt's about science, it's about rationalism.
p14
aVSo therefore, we get a lot of complaints
p15
aVevery single week \u2014
p16
aVcomplaints including one we get very often,
p17
aVwhich is to say the very title, "Infinite Monkey Cage,"
p18
aVcelebrates the idea of vivisection.
p19
aVWe have made it quite clear to these people
p20
aVthat an infinite monkey cage is roomy.
p21
aa(lp22
V(Laughter)
p23
aa(lp24
VWe also had someone else who said,
p25
aV"'The Infinite Monkey Cage' idea is ridiculous.
p26
aVAn infinite number of monkeys
p27
aVcould never write the works of Shakespeare.
p28
aVWe know this because they did an experiment."
p29
aVYes, they gave 12 monkeys a typewriter for a week,
p30
aVand after a week, they only used it as a bathroom.
p31
aa(lp32
V(Laughter)
p33
aa(lp34
VSo the main element though, the main complaint we get \u2014
p35
aVand one that I find most worrying \u2014
p36
aVis that people say, "Oh, why do you insist
p37
aVon ruining the magic?
p38
aVYou bring in science, and it ruins the magic."
p39
aVNow I'm an arts graduate;
p40
aVI love myth and magic
p41
aVand existentialism and self-loathing.
p42
aVThat's what I do.
p43
aVBut I also don't understand
p44
aVhow it does ruin the magic.
p45
aVAll of the magic, I think,
p46
aVthat may well be taken away by science
p47
aVis then replaced by something as wonderful.
p48
aa(lp49
VAstrology, for instance:
p50
aVlike many rationalists, I'm a Pisces.
p51
aV(Laughter)
p52
aVNow astrology \u2014
p53
aVwe remove the banal idea
p54
aVthat your life could be predicted;
p55
aVthat you'll, perhaps today, meet a lucky man
p56
aVwho's wearing a hat.
p57
aVThat is gone.
p58
aVBut if we want to look at the sky and see predictions, we still can.
p59
aVWe can see predictions of galaxies forming,
p60
aVof galaxies colliding into each other, of new solar systems.
p61
aVThis is a wonderful thing.
p62
aVIf the Sun could one day \u2014 and indeed the Earth, in fact \u2014
p63
aVif the Earth could read its own astrological, astronomical chart,
p64
aVone day it would say,
p65
aV"Not a good day for making plans.
p66
aVYou'll been engulfed by a red giant."
p67
aa(lp68
VAnd that to me as well,
p69
aVthat if you think I'm worried about losing worlds,
p70
aVwell Many Worlds theory \u2014
p71
aVone of the most beautiful, fascinating,
p72
aVsometimes terrifying ideas
p73
aVfrom the quantum interpretation \u2014
p74
aVis a wonderful thing.
p75
aVThat every person here, every decision that you've made today,
p76
aVevery decision you've made in your life,
p77
aVyou've not really made that decision,
p78
aVbut in fact, every single permutation of those decisions
p79
aVis made, each one going off into a new universe.
p80
aVThat is a wonderful idea.
p81
aVIf you ever think that your life is rubbish,
p82
aValways remember
p83
aVthere's another you that's made much worse decisions than that.
p84
aV(Laughter)
p85
aVIf you ever think, "Ah, I want to end it all,"
p86
aVdon't end it all.
p87
aVRemember that in the majority of universes,
p88
aVyou don't even exist in the first place.
p89
aVThis to me, in its own strange way,
p90
aVis very, very comforting.
p91
aa(lp92
VNow reincarnation, that's another thing gone \u2014 the afterlife.
p93
aVBut it's not gone.
p94
aVScience actually says
p95
aVwe will live forever.
p96
aVWell, there is one proviso.
p97
aVWe won't actually live forever. You won't live forever.
p98
aVYour consciousness, the you-ness of you, the me-ness of me \u2014
p99
aVthat gets this one go.
p100
aVBut every single thing that makes us,
p101
aVevery atom in us,
p102
aVhas already created a myriad of different things
p103
aVand will go on to create a myriad of new things.
p104
aVWe have been mountains
p105
aVand apples and pulsars
p106
aVand other people's knees.
p107
aVWho knows, maybe one of your atoms was once Napoleon's knee.
p108
aVThat is a good thing.
p109
aVUnlike the occupants of the universe,
p110
aVthe universe itself is not wasteful.
p111
aVWe are all totally recyclable.
p112
aVAnd when we die,
p113
aVwe don't even have to be placed in different refuse sacs.
p114
aVThis is a wonderful thing.
p115
aa(lp116
VUnderstanding, to me,
p117
aVdoes not remove the wonder and the joy.
p118
aVFor instance, my wife could turn to me and she may say,
p119
aV"Why do you love me?"
p120
aVAnd I can with all honesty
p121
aVlook her in the eye and say,
p122
aV"Because our pheromones
p123
aVmatched our olfactory receptors."
p124
aV(Laughter)
p125
aVThough I'll probably also say something
p126
aVabout her hair and personality as well.
p127
aVAnd that is a wonderful thing there.
p128
aVLove does not die because of that thing.
p129
aa(lp130
VPain doesn't go away either.
p131
aVThis is a terrible thing, even though I understand pain.
p132
aVIf someone punches me \u2014
p133
aVand because of my personality,
p134
aVthis is recently a regular occurrence \u2014
p135
aVI understand where the pain comes from.
p136
aVIt is basically momentum to energy
p137
aVwhere the four-vector is constant \u2014 that's what it is.
p138
aVBut at no point can I react and go,
p139
aV"Ha! Is that the best momentum-to-energy fourth vector constant you've got?"
p140
aVNo, I just spit out a tooth.
p141
aa(lp142
V(Laughter)
p143
aa(lp144
VAnd that is all of these different things \u2014 the love for my child.
p145
aVI have a son. His name is Archie.
p146
aVI'm very lucky,
p147
aVbecause he's better than all the other children.
p148
aVNow I know you don't think that.
p149
aVYou may well have your own children
p150
aVand think, "Oh no, my child's best."
p151
aVThat's the wonderful thing about evolution \u2014
p152
aVthe predilection to believe
p153
aVthat our child is best.
p154
aVNow in many ways, that's just a survival thing.
p155
aVThe fact we see here is the vehicle for our genes,
p156
aVand therefore we love it.
p157
aVBut we don't notice that bit; we just unconditionally love.
p158
aVThat is a wonderful thing.
p159
aVThough I should say that my son is best
p160
aVand is better than your children.
p161
aVI've done some tests.
p162
aa(lp163
VAnd all of these things to me
p164
aVgive such joy and excitement and wonder.
p165
aVEven quantum mechanics can give you an excuse
p166
aVfor bad housework, for instance.
p167
aVPerhaps you've been at home for a week on your own.
p168
aVYou house is in a terrible state.
p169
aVYour partner is about to return.
p170
aVYou think, what should I do?
p171
aVDo nothing.
p172
aVAll you have to do
p173
aVis, when she walks in, using a quantum interpretation,
p174
aVsay, "I'm so sorry.
p175
aVI stopped observing the house for a moment,
p176
aVand when I started observing again,
p177
aVeverything had happened."
p178
aV(Laughter)
p179
aVThat's the strong anthropic principle of vacuuming.
p180
aa(lp181
VFor me, it's a very, very important thing.
p182
aVEven on my journey up here \u2014
p183
aVthe joy that I have on my journey up here every single time.
p184
aVIf you actually think, you remove the myth and there is still something wonderful.
p185
aVI'm sitting on a train.
p186
aVEvery time I breathe in,
p187
aVI'm breathing in a million-billion-billion
p188
aVatoms of oxygen.
p189
aVI'm sitting on a chair.
p190
aVEven though I know the chair is made of atoms
p191
aVand therefore actually in many ways empty space,
p192
aVI find it comfortable.
p193
aVI look out the window, and I realize
p194
aVthat every single time we stop and I look out that window,
p195
aVframed in that window,
p196
aVwherever we are,
p197
aVI am observing more life
p198
aVthan there is in the rest of the known universe
p199
aVbeyond the planet Earth.
p200
aVIf you go to the safari parks
p201
aVon Saturn or Jupiter,
p202
aVyou will be disappointed.
p203
aVAnd I realize I'm observing this
p204
aVwith the brain, the human brain,
p205
aVthe most complex thing in the known universe.
p206
aVThat, to me, is an incredible thing.
p207
aVAnd do you know what, that might be enough.
p208
aa(lp209
VSteven Weinberg, the Nobel laureate, once said,
p210
aV"The more the universe seems comprehensible,
p211
aVthe more it seems pointless."
p212
aVNow for some people,
p213
aVthat seems to lead to an idea of nihilism.
p214
aVBut for me, it doesn't. That is a wonderful thing.
p215
aVI'm glad the universe is pointless.
p216
aVIt means if I get to the end of my life,
p217
aVthe universe can't turn to me and go, "What have you been doing, you idiot?
p218
aVThat's not the point."
p219
aVI can make my own purpose.
p220
aVYou can make your own purpose.
p221
aVWe have the individual power
p222
aVto go, "This is what I want to do."
p223
aVAnd in a pointless universe, that, to me, is a wonderful thing.
p224
aVI have chosen to make silly jokes
p225
aVabout quantum mechanics and the Copenhagen interpretation.
p226
aVYou, I imagine, can do much better things with your time.
p227
aa(lp228
VThank you very much. Goodbye.
