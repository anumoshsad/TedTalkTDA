VDo you worry about what is going to kill you?
p4
aVHeart disease, cancer,
p5
aVa car accident?
p6
aVMost of us worry about things we can't control,
p7
aVlike war, terrorism,
p8
aVthe tragic earthquake that just occurred in Haiti.
p9
aVBut what really threatens humanity?
p10
aVA few years ago, Professor Vaclav Smil
p11
aVtried to calculate the probability
p12
aVof sudden disasters
p13
aVlarge enough to change history.
p14
aVHe called these,
p15
aV"massively fatal discontinuities,"
p16
aVmeaning that they could kill
p17
aVup to 100 million people
p18
aVin the next 50 years.
p19
aVHe looked at the odds of another world war,
p20
aVof a massive volcanic eruption,
p21
aVeven of an asteroid hitting the Earth.
p22
aVBut he placed the likelihood of one such event
p23
aVabove all others
p24
aVat close to 100 percent,
p25
aVand that is a severe flu pandemic.
p26
aVNow, you might think of flu
p27
aVas just a really bad cold,
p28
aVbut it can be a death sentence.
p29
aVEvery year, 36,000 people in the United States
p30
aVdie of seasonal flu.
p31
aVIn the developing world, the data is much sketchier
p32
aVbut the death toll is almost
p33
aVcertainly higher.
p34
aVYou know, the problem is if
p35
aVthis virus occasionally mutates
p36
aVso dramatically,
p37
aVit essentially is a new virus
p38
aVand then we get a pandemic.
p39
aa(lp40
VIn 1918, a new virus appeared
p41
aVthat killed some 50 to 100 million people.
p42
aVIt spread like wildfire
p43
aVand some died within hours of developing symptoms.
p44
aVAre we safer today?
p45
aVWell, we seem to have dodged
p46
aVthe deadly pandemic this year
p47
aVthat most of us feared,
p48
aVbut this threat could reappear at any time.
p49
aVThe good news is that
p50
aVwe're at a moment in time
p51
aVwhen science, technology, globalization is converging
p52
aVto create an unprecedented possibility:
p53
aVthe possibility to make history
p54
aVby preventing infectious diseases
p55
aVthat still account for one-fifth of all deaths
p56
aVand countless misery on Earth.
p57
aVWe can do this.
p58
aVWe're already preventing millions of deaths
p59
aVwith existing vaccines,
p60
aVand if we get these to more people,
p61
aVwe can certainly save more lives.
p62
aVBut with new or better vaccines
p63
aVfor malaria, TB, HIV,
p64
aVpneumonia, diarrhea, flu,
p65
aVwe could end suffering
p66
aVthat has been on the Earth since the beginning of time.
p67
aa(lp68
VSo, I'm here to trumpet vaccines for you.
p69
aVBut first, I have to explain why they're important
p70
aVbecause vaccines, the power of them,
p71
aVis really like a whisper.
p72
aVWhen they work, they can make history,
p73
aVbut after a while
p74
aVyou can barely hear them.
p75
aVNow, some of us are old enough
p76
aVto have a small, circular scar on our arms
p77
aVfrom an inoculation we received as children.
p78
aVBut when was the last time you worried about smallpox,
p79
aVa disease that killed half a billion people last century
p80
aVand no longer is with us?
p81
aVOr polio? How many of you remember the iron lung?
p82
aVWe don't see scenes like this anymore
p83
aVbecause of vaccines.
p84
aa(lp85
VNow, it's interesting
p86
aVbecause there are 30-odd diseases
p87
aVthat can be treated with vaccines now,
p88
aVbut we're still threatened by things like HIV and flu.
p89
aVWhy is that?
p90
aVWell, here's the dirty little secret.
p91
aVUntil recently, we haven't had to know
p92
aVexactly how a vaccine worked.
p93
aVWe knew they worked through old-fashioned trial and error.
p94
aVYou took a pathogen, you modified it,
p95
aVyou injected it into a person or an animal
p96
aVand you saw what happened.
p97
aVThis worked well for most pathogens,
p98
aVsomewhat well for crafty bugs like flu,
p99
aVbut not at all for HIV,
p100
aVfor which humans have no natural immunity.
p101
aa(lp102
VSo let's explore how vaccines work.
p103
aVThey basically create a cache
p104
aVof weapons for your immune system
p105
aVwhich you can deploy when needed.
p106
aVNow, when you get a viral infection,
p107
aVwhat normally happens is it takes days or weeks
p108
aVfor your body to fight back
p109
aVat full strength,
p110
aVand that might be too late.
p111
aVWhen you're pre-immunized,
p112
aVwhat happens is you have forces in your body
p113
aVpre-trained to recognize
p114
aVand defeat specific foes.
p115
aVSo that's really how vaccines work.
p116
aVNow, let's take a look at a video
p117
aVthat we're debuting at TED, for the first time,
p118
aVon how an effective HIV vaccine might work.
p119
aa(lp120
V(Music)
p121
aa(lp122
VNarrator: A vaccine trains the body in advance
p123
aVhow to recognize and neutralize
p124
aVa specific invader.
p125
aVAfter HIV penetrates the body's mucosal barriers,
p126
aVit infects immune cells to replicate.
p127
aVThe invader draws the attention
p128
aVof the immune system's front-line troops.
p129
aVDendritic cells, or macrophages,
p130
aVcapture the virus and display pieces of it.
p131
aVMemory cells generated by the HIV vaccine
p132
aVare activated when they learn
p133
aVHIV is present from the front-line troops.
p134
aVThese memory cells immediately deploy
p135
aVthe exact weapons needed.
p136
aVMemory B cells turn into plasma cells,
p137
aVwhich produce wave after wave
p138
aVof the specific antibodies
p139
aVthat latch onto HIV
p140
aVto prevent it from infecting cells,
p141
aVwhile squadrons of killer T cells
p142
aVseek out and destroy cells
p143
aVthat are already HIV infected.
p144
aVThe virus is defeated.
p145
aVWithout a vaccine,
p146
aVthese responses would have taken more than a week.
p147
aVBy that time, the battle against HIV
p148
aVwould already have been lost.
p149
aa(lp150
VSeth Berkley: Really cool video, isn't it?
p151
aVThe antibodies you just saw in this video,
p152
aVin action, are the ones that make most vaccines work.
p153
aVSo the real question then is:
p154
aVHow do we ensure that your body makes
p155
aVthe exact ones that we need to protect
p156
aVagainst flu and HIV?
p157
aVThe principal challenge for both of these viruses
p158
aVis that they're always changing.
p159
aVSo let's take a look at the flu virus.
p160
aVIn this rendering of the flu virus,
p161
aVthese different colored spikes are what it uses to infect you.
p162
aVAnd also, what the antibodies use is a handle
p163
aVto essentially grab and neutralize the virus.
p164
aVWhen these mutate, they change their shape,
p165
aVand the antibodies don't know what they're looking at anymore.
p166
aVSo that's why every year
p167
aVyou can catch a slightly different strain of flu.
p168
aVIt's also why in the spring,
p169
aVwe have to make a best guess
p170
aVat which three strains are going to prevail the next year,
p171
aVput those into a single vaccine
p172
aVand rush those into production for the fall.
p173
aa(lp174
VEven worse,
p175
aVthe most common influenza \u2014 influenza A \u2014
p176
aValso infects animals
p177
aVthat live in close proximity to humans,
p178
aVand they can recombine
p179
aVin those particular animals.
p180
aVIn addition, wild aquatic birds
p181
aVcarry all known strains
p182
aVof influenza.
p183
aVSo, you've got this situation:
p184
aVIn 2003,
p185
aVwe had an H5N1 virus
p186
aVthat jumped from birds into humans
p187
aVin a few isolated cases
p188
aVwith an apparent mortality rate of 70 percent.
p189
aVNow luckily, that particular virus,
p190
aValthough very scary at the time,
p191
aVdid not transmit from person to person
p192
aVvery easily.
p193
aVThis year's H1N1 threat
p194
aVwas actually a human, avian, swine mixture
p195
aVthat arose in Mexico.
p196
aVIt was easily transmitted,
p197
aVbut, luckily, was pretty mild.
p198
aVAnd so, in a sense,
p199
aVour luck is holding out,
p200
aVbut you know, another wild bird could fly over at anytime.
p201
aa(lp202
VNow let's take a look at HIV.
p203
aVAs variable as flu is,
p204
aVHIV makes flu
p205
aVlook like the Rock of Gibraltar.
p206
aVThe virus that causes AIDS
p207
aVis the trickiest pathogen
p208
aVscientists have ever confronted.
p209
aVIt mutates furiously,
p210
aVit has decoys to evade the immune system,
p211
aVit attacks the very cells that are trying to fight it
p212
aVand it quickly hides itself
p213
aVin your genome.
p214
aVHere's a slide looking at
p215
aVthe genetic variation of flu
p216
aVand comparing that to HIV,
p217
aVa much wilder target.
p218
aVIn the video a moment ago,
p219
aVyou saw fleets of new viruses launching from infected cells.
p220
aVNow realize that in a recently infected person,
p221
aVthere are millions of these ships;
p222
aVeach one is just slightly different.
p223
aVFinding a weapon that recognizes
p224
aVand sinks all of them
p225
aVmakes the job that much harder.
p226
aa(lp227
VNow, in the 27 years since HIV
p228
aVwas identified as the cause of AIDS,
p229
aVwe've developed more drugs to treat HIV
p230
aVthan all other viruses put together.
p231
aVThese drugs aren't cures,
p232
aVbut they represent a huge triumph of science
p233
aVbecause they take away the automatic death sentence
p234
aVfrom a diagnosis of HIV,
p235
aVat least for those who can access them.
p236
aVThe vaccine effort though is really quite different.
p237
aVLarge companies moved away from it
p238
aVbecause they thought the science was so difficult
p239
aVand vaccines were seen as poor business.
p240
aVMany thought that it was just impossible to make an AIDS vaccine,
p241
aVbut today, evidence tells us otherwise.
p242
aa(lp243
VIn September,
p244
aVwe had surprising but exciting findings
p245
aVfrom a clinical trial that took place in Thailand.
p246
aVFor the first time, we saw an AIDS vaccine work in humans \u2014
p247
aValbeit, quite modestly \u2014
p248
aVand that particular vaccine was made
p249
aValmost a decade ago.
p250
aVNewer concepts and early testing now
p251
aVshow even greater promise in the best of our animal models.
p252
aVBut in the past few months, researchers have also isolated
p253
aVseveral new broadly neutralizing antibodies
p254
aVfrom the blood of an HIV infected individual.
p255
aVNow, what does this mean?
p256
aVWe saw earlier that HIV
p257
aVis highly variable,
p258
aVthat a broad neutralizing antibody
p259
aVlatches on and disables
p260
aVmultiple variations of the virus.
p261
aVIf you take these and you put them
p262
aVin the best of our monkey models,
p263
aVthey provide full protection from infection.
p264
aVIn addition, these researchers found
p265
aVa new site on HIV
p266
aVwhere the antibodies can grab onto,
p267
aVand what's so special about this spot
p268
aVis that it changes very little
p269
aVas the virus mutates.
p270
aVIt's like, as many times
p271
aVas the virus changes its clothes,
p272
aVit's still wearing the same socks,
p273
aVand now our job is to make sure
p274
aVwe get the body to really hate those socks.
p275
aa(lp276
VSo what we've got is a situation.
p277
aVThe Thai results tell us
p278
aVwe can make an AIDS vaccine,
p279
aVand the antibody findings
p280
aVtell us how we might do that.
p281
aVThis strategy, working backwards
p282
aVfrom an antibody to create a vaccine candidate,
p283
aVhas never been done before in vaccine research.
p284
aVIt's called retro-vaccinology,
p285
aVand its implications extend
p286
aVway beyond that of just HIV.
p287
aVSo think of it this way.
p288
aVWe've got these new antibodies we've identified,
p289
aVand we know that they latch onto many, many variations of the virus.
p290
aVWe know that they have to latch onto a specific part,
p291
aVso if we can figure out the precise structure of that part,
p292
aVpresent that through a vaccine,
p293
aVwhat we hope is we can prompt
p294
aVyour immune system to make these matching antibodies.
p295
aVAnd that would create
p296
aVa universal HIV vaccine.
p297
aVNow, it sounds easier than it is
p298
aVbecause the structure actually looks more like
p299
aVthis blue antibody diagram
p300
aVattached to its yellow binding site,
p301
aVand as you can imagine, these three-dimensional structures
p302
aVare much harder to work on.
p303
aVAnd if you guys have ideas to help us solve this,
p304
aVwe'd love to hear about it.
p305
aa(lp306
VBut, you know, the research that has occurred from HIV now
p307
aVhas really helped with innovation with other diseases.
p308
aVSo for instance, a biotechnology company
p309
aVhas now found broadly neutralizing
p310
aVantibodies to influenza,
p311
aVas well as a new antibody target on the flu virus.
p312
aVThey're currently making a cocktail \u2014
p313
aVan antibody cocktail \u2014 that can be used to treat
p314
aVsevere, overwhelming cases of flu.
p315
aVIn the longer term, what they can do
p316
aVis use these tools of retro-vaccinology
p317
aVto make a preventive flu vaccine.
p318
aVNow, retro-vaccinology is just one technique
p319
aVwithin the ambit of so-called rational vaccine design.
p320
aa(lp321
VLet me give you another example.
p322
aVWe talked about before the H and N spikes
p323
aVon the surface of the flu virus.
p324
aVNotice these other, smaller protuberances.
p325
aVThese are largely hidden from the immune system.
p326
aVNow it turns out that these spots
p327
aValso don't change much when the virus mutates.
p328
aVIf you can cripple these with specific antibodies,
p329
aVyou could cripple all versions of the flu.
p330
aVSo far, animal tests indicate
p331
aVthat such a vaccine could prevent severe disease,
p332
aValthough you might get a mild case.
p333
aVSo if this works in humans, what we're talking about
p334
aVis a universal flu vaccine,
p335
aVone that doesn't need to change every year
p336
aVand would remove the threat of death.
p337
aVWe really could think of flu, then,
p338
aVas just a bad cold.
p339
aa(lp340
VOf course, the best vaccine imaginable
p341
aVis only valuable to the extent
p342
aVwe get it to everyone who needs it.
p343
aVSo to do that, we have to combine
p344
aVsmart vaccine design with smart production methods
p345
aVand, of course, smart delivery methods.
p346
aVSo I want you to think back a few months ago.
p347
aVIn June, the World Health Organization
p348
aVdeclared the first global
p349
aVflu pandemic in 41 years.
p350
aVThe U.S. government promised
p351
aV150 million doses of vaccine
p352
aVby October 15th for the flu peak.
p353
aVVaccines were promised to developing countries.
p354
aVHundreds of millions of dollars were spent
p355
aVand flowed to accelerating vaccine manufacturing.
p356
aVSo what happened?
p357
aa(lp358
VWell, we first figured out
p359
aVhow to make flu vaccines, how to produce them,
p360
aVin the early 1940s.
p361
aVIt was a slow, cumbersome process
p362
aVthat depended on chicken eggs,
p363
aVmillions of living chicken eggs.
p364
aVViruses only grow in living things,
p365
aVand so it turned out that, for flu,
p366
aVchicken eggs worked really well.
p367
aVFor most strains, you could get one to two doses
p368
aVof vaccine per egg.
p369
aVLuckily for us,
p370
aVwe live in an era of breathtaking
p371
aVbiomedical advances.
p372
aVSo today, we get our flu vaccines from ...
p373
aVchicken eggs,
p374
aV(Laughter)
p375
aVhundreds of millions of chicken eggs.
p376
aVAlmost nothing has changed.
p377
aVThe system is reliable
p378
aVbut the problem is you never know how well
p379
aVa strain is going to grow.
p380
aVThis year's swine flu strain
p381
aVgrew very poorly in early production:
p382
aVbasically .6 doses per egg.
p383
aVSo, here's an alarming thought.
p384
aVWhat if that wild bird flies by again?
p385
aVYou could see an avian strain
p386
aVthat would infect the poultry flocks,
p387
aVand then we would have no eggs for our vaccines.
p388
aVSo, Dan [Barber], if you want
p389
aVbillions of chicken pellets
p390
aVfor your fish farm,
p391
aVI know where to get them.
p392
aVSo right now, the world can produce
p393
aVabout 350 million doses
p394
aVof flu vaccine for the three strains,
p395
aVand we can up that to about 1.2 billion doses
p396
aVif we want to target a single variant
p397
aVlike swine flu.
p398
aVBut this assumes that our factories are humming
p399
aVbecause, in 2004,
p400
aVthe U.S. supply was cut in half
p401
aVby contamination at one single plant.
p402
aVAnd the process still takes
p403
aVmore than half a year.
p404
aa(lp405
VSo are we better prepared
p406
aVthan we were in 1918?
p407
aVWell, with the new technologies emerging now,
p408
aVI hope we can say definitively, "Yes."
p409
aVImagine we could produce enough flu vaccine
p410
aVfor everyone in the entire world
p411
aVfor less than half of what we're currently spending
p412
aVnow in the United States.
p413
aVWith a range of new technologies, we could.
p414
aVHere's an example:
p415
aVA company I'm engaged with has found
p416
aVa specific piece of the H spike of flu
p417
aVthat sparks the immune system.
p418
aVIf you lop this off and attach it
p419
aVto the tail of a different bacterium,
p420
aVwhich creates a vigorous immune response,
p421
aVthey've created a very powerful flu fighter.
p422
aVThis vaccine is so small
p423
aVit can be grown in a common bacteria, E. coli.
p424
aVNow, as you know, bacteria reproduce quickly \u2014
p425
aVit's like making yogurt \u2014
p426
aVand so we could produce enough swine origin flu
p427
aVfor the entire world in a few factories, in a few weeks,
p428
aVwith no eggs,
p429
aVfor a fraction of the cost of current methods.
p430
aa(lp431
V(Applause)
p432
aa(lp433
VSo here's a comparison of several of these new vaccine technologies.
p434
aVAnd, aside from the radically increased production
p435
aVand huge cost savings \u2014
p436
aVfor example, the E. coli method I just talked about \u2014
p437
aVlook at the time saved: this would be lives saved.
p438
aVThe developing world,
p439
aVmostly left out of the current response,
p440
aVsees the potential of these alternate technologies
p441
aVand they're leapfrogging the West.
p442
aVIndia, Mexico and others are already
p443
aVmaking experimental flu vaccines,
p444
aVand they may be the first place
p445
aVwe see these vaccines in use.
p446
aVBecause these technologies are so efficient
p447
aVand relatively cheap,
p448
aVbillions of people can have access to lifesaving vaccines
p449
aVif we can figure out how to deliver them.
p450
aa(lp451
VNow think of where this leads us.
p452
aVNew infectious diseases
p453
aVappear or reappear
p454
aVevery few years.
p455
aVSome day, perhaps soon,
p456
aVwe'll have a virus that is going to threaten all of us.
p457
aVWill we be quick enough to react
p458
aVbefore millions die?
p459
aVLuckily, this year's flu was relatively mild.
p460
aVI say, "luckily" in part
p461
aVbecause virtually no one in the developing world
p462
aVwas vaccinated.
p463
aVSo if we have the political and financial foresight
p464
aVto sustain our investments,
p465
aVwe will master these and new tools of vaccinology,
p466
aVand with these tools we can produce
p467
aVenough vaccine for everyone at low cost
p468
aVand ensure healthy productive lives.
p469
aVNo longer must flu have to kill half a million people a year.
p470
aVNo longer does AIDS
p471
aVneed to kill two million a year.
p472
aVNo longer do the poor and vulnerable
p473
aVneed to be threatened by infectious diseases,
p474
aVor indeed, anybody.
p475
aVInstead of having Vaclav Smil's
p476
aV"massively fatal discontinuity" of life,
p477
aVwe can ensure
p478
aVthe continuity of life.
p479
aVWhat the world needs now are these new vaccines,
p480
aVand we can make it happen.
p481
aa(lp482
VThank you very much.
p483
aa(lp484
V(Applause)
p485
aa(lp486
VChris Anderson: Thank you.
p487
aV(Applause)
p488
aVThank you.
p489
aVSo, the science is changing.
p490
aVIn your mind, Seth \u2014 I mean, you must dream about this \u2014
p491
aVwhat is the kind of time scale
p492
aVon, let's start with HIV,
p493
aVfor a game-changing vaccine that's actually out there and usable?
p494
aa(lp495
VSB: The game change can come at any time,
p496
aVbecause the problem we have now is
p497
aVwe've shown we can get a vaccine to work in humans;
p498
aVwe just need a better one.
p499
aVAnd with these types of antibodies, we know humans can make them.
p500
aVSo, if we can figure out how to do that,
p501
aVthen we have the vaccine,
p502
aVand what's interesting is there already is
p503
aVsome evidence that we're beginning to crack that problem.
p504
aVSo, the challenge is full speed ahead.
p505
aa(lp506
VCA: In your gut, do you think it's probably going to be at least another five years?
p507
aa(lp508
VSB: You know, everybody says it's 10 years,
p509
aVbut it's been 10 years every 10 years.
p510
aVSo I hate to put a timeline
p511
aVon scientific innovation,
p512
aVbut the investments that have occurred are now paying dividends.
p513
aa(lp514
VCA: And that's the same with universal flu vaccine, the same kind of thing?
p515
aa(lp516
VSB: I think flu is different. I think what happened with flu is
p517
aVwe've got a bunch \u2014 I just showed some of this \u2014
p518
aVa bunch of really cool and useful technologies that are ready to go now.
p519
aVThey look good. The problem has been that,
p520
aVwhat we did is we invested in traditional technologies
p521
aVbecause that's what we were comfortable with.
p522
aVYou also can use adjuvants, which are chemicals you mix.
p523
aVThat's what Europe is doing, so we could have diluted out
p524
aVour supply of flu and made more available,
p525
aVbut, going back to what Michael Specter said,
p526
aVthe anti-vaccine crowd didn't really want that to happen.
p527
aa(lp528
VCA: And malaria's even further behind?
p529
aa(lp530
VSB: No, malaria, there is a candidate
p531
aVthat actually showed efficacy in an earlier trial
p532
aVand is currently in phase three trials now.
p533
aVIt probably isn't the perfect vaccine, but it's moving along.
p534
aa(lp535
VCA: Seth, most of us do work where every month,
p536
aVwe produce something;
p537
aVwe get that kind of gratification.
p538
aVYou've been slaving away at this for more than a decade,
p539
aVand I salute you and your colleagues for what you do.
p540
aVThe world needs people like you. Thank you.
p541
aa(lp542
VSB: Thank you.
