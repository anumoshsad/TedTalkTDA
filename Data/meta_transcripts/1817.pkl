VThis is Charley Williams.
p4
aVHe was 94 when this photograph was taken.
p5
aVIn the 1930s, Roosevelt put
p6
aVthousands and thousands of Americans back to work
p7
aVby building bridges and infrastructure and tunnels,
p8
aVbut he also did something interesting,
p9
aVwhich was to hire a few hundred writers
p10
aVto scour America to capture the stories of ordinary Americans.
p11
aVCharley Williams, a poor sharecropper,
p12
aVwouldn't ordinarily be the subject of a big interview,
p13
aVbut Charley had actually been a slave
p14
aVuntil he was 22 years old.
p15
aVAnd the stories that were captured of his life
p16
aVmake up one of the crown jewels
p17
aVof histories, of human-lived experiences
p18
aVfilled with ex-slaves.
p19
aa(lp20
VAnna Deavere Smith famously said that
p21
aVthere's a literature inside of each of us,
p22
aVand three generations later, I was part of a project
p23
aVcalled StoryCorps,
p24
aVwhich set out to capture
p25
aVthe stories of ordinary Americans
p26
aVby setting up a soundproof booth in public spaces.
p27
aVThe idea is very, very simple.
p28
aVYou go into these booths, you interview your grandmother
p29
aVor relative, you leave with a copy of the interview
p30
aVand an interview goes into the Library of Congress.
p31
aVIt's essentially a way to make a national oral histories archive
p32
aVone conversation at a time.
p33
aVAnd the question is, who do you want to remember \u2014
p34
aVif you had just 45 minutes with your grandmother?
p35
aVWhat's interesting, in conversations with the founder, Dave Isay,
p36
aVwe always actually talked about this
p37
aVas a little bit of a subversive project,
p38
aVbecause when you think about it,
p39
aVit's actually not really about the stories that are being told,
p40
aVit's about listening,
p41
aVand it's about the questions that you get to ask,
p42
aVquestions that you may not have permission to
p43
aVon any other day.
p44
aVI'm going to play you just a couple of quick excerpts from the project.
p45
aa(lp46
V[Jesus Melendez talking about poet Pedro Pietri's final moments]
p47
aa(lp48
VJesus Melendez: We took off, and as we were ascending,
p49
aVbefore we had leveled off,
p50
aVour level-off point was 45,000 feet,
p51
aVso before we had leveled off,
p52
aVPedro began leaving us,
p53
aVand the beauty about it
p54
aVis that I believe that there's something after life.
p55
aVYou can see it in Pedro.
p56
aa(lp57
V[Danny Perasa to his wife Annie Perasa married 26 years]
p58
aa(lp59
VDanny Perasa: See, the thing of it is,
p60
aVI always feel guilty when I say "I love you" to you,
p61
aVand I say it so often. I say it to remind you
p62
aVthat as dumpy as I am, it's coming from me,
p63
aVit's like hearing a beautiful song from a busted old radio,
p64
aVand it's nice of you to keep the radio around the house.
p65
aa(lp66
V(Laughter)
p67
aa(lp68
V[Michael Wolmetz with his girlfriend Debora Brakarz]
p69
aa(lp70
VMichael Wolmetz: So this is the ring that my father gave to my mother,
p71
aVand we can leave it there.
p72
aVAnd he saved up and he purchased this,
p73
aVand he proposed to my mother with this,
p74
aVand so I thought that I would give it to you
p75
aVso that he could be with us for this also.
p76
aVSo I'm going to share a mic with you right now, Debora.
p77
aVWhere's the right finger?
p78
aVDebora Brakarz: (Crying)
p79
aVMW: Debora, will you please marry me?
p80
aVDB: Yes. Of course. I love you.
p81
aV(Kissing)
p82
aVMW: So kids, this is how your mother and I got married,
p83
aVin a booth in Grand Central Station with my father's ring.
p84
aVMy grandfather was a cab driver for 40 years.
p85
aVHe used to pick people up here every day.
p86
aVSo it seems right.
p87
aa(lp88
VJake Barton: So I have to say
p89
aVI did not actually choose those individual samples to make you cry
p90
aVbecause they all make you cry.
p91
aVThe entire project is predicated on this act of love
p92
aVwhich is listening itself.
p93
aVAnd that motion of building an institution
p94
aVout of a moment of conversation and listening
p95
aVis actually a lot of what my firm, Local Projects,
p96
aVis doing with our engagements in general.
p97
aVSo we're a media design firm, and we're working
p98
aVwith a broad array of different institutions
p99
aVbuilding media installations for museums and public spaces.
p100
aa(lp101
VOur latest engagement is the Cleveland Museum of Art,
p102
aVwhich we've created an engagement called Gallery One for.
p103
aVAnd Gallery One is an interesting project
p104
aVbecause it started with this massive, $350 million expansion
p105
aVfor the Cleveland Museum of Art,
p106
aVand we actually brought in this piece
p107
aVspecifically to grow new capacity, new audiences,
p108
aVat the same time that the museum itself is growing.
p109
aa(lp110
VGlenn Lowry, the head of MoMA, put it best when he said,
p111
aV"We want visitors to actually cease being visitors.
p112
aVVisitors are transient. We want people who live here,
p113
aVpeople who have ownership."
p114
aa(lp115
VAnd so what we're doing is making a broad array
p116
aVof different ways for people to actually engage
p117
aVwith the material inside of these galleries,
p118
aVso you can still have a traditional gallery experience,
p119
aVbut if you're interested, you can actually engage
p120
aVwith any individual artwork and see the original context
p121
aVfrom where it's from, or manipulate the work itself.
p122
aVSo, for example, you can click on this individual lion head,
p123
aVand this is where it originated from, 1300 B.C.
p124
aVOr this individual piece here,
p125
aVyou can see the actual bedroom. It really changes the way
p126
aVyou think about this type of a tempera painting.
p127
aVThis is one of my favorites because you see the studio itself.
p128
aVThis is Rodin's bust. You get the sense
p129
aVof this incredible factory for creativity.
p130
aVAnd it makes you think about literally the hundreds
p131
aVor thousands of years of human creativity and how
p132
aVeach individual artwork stands in for part of that story.
p133
aVThis is Picasso,
p134
aVof course embodying so much of it from the 20th century.
p135
aa(lp136
VAnd so our next interface, which I'll show you,
p137
aVactually leverages that idea of this lineage of creativity.
p138
aVIt's an algorithm that actually allows you to browse
p139
aVthe actual museum's collection using facial recognition.
p140
aVSo this person's making different faces,
p141
aVand it's actually drawing forth different objects
p142
aVfrom the collection that connect with exactly how she's looking.
p143
aVAnd so you can imagine that, as people are performing
p144
aVinside of the museum itself, you get this sense
p145
aVof this emotional connection,
p146
aVthis way in which our face connects with the thousands
p147
aVand tens of thousands of years.
p148
aVThis is an interface that actually allows you to draw
p149
aVand then draws forth objects using those same shapes.
p150
aVSo more and more we're trying to find ways
p151
aVfor people to actually author things inside of the museums themselves,
p152
aVto be creative even as they're looking
p153
aVat other people's creativity and understanding them.
p154
aa(lp155
VSo in this wall, the collections wall,
p156
aVyou can actually see all 3,000 artworks all at the same time,
p157
aVand you can actually author your own
p158
aVindividual walking tours of the museum, so you can share them,
p159
aVand someone can take a tour with the museum director
p160
aVor a tour with their little cousin.
p161
aa(lp162
VBut all the while that we've been working
p163
aVon this engagement for Cleveland,
p164
aVwe've also been working in the background
p165
aVon really our largest engagement to date,
p166
aVand that's the 9/11 Memorial and Museum.
p167
aa(lp168
VSo we started in 2006
p169
aVas part of a team with Thinc Design
p170
aVto create the original master plan for the museum,
p171
aVand then we've done all the media design
p172
aVboth for the museum and the memorial and then the media production.
p173
aVSo the memorial opened in 2011,
p174
aVand the museum's going to open next year in 2014.
p175
aVAnd you can see from these images,
p176
aVthe site is so raw and almost archaeological.
p177
aVAnd of course the event itself is so recent,
p178
aVsomewhere between history and current events,
p179
aVit was a huge challenge to imagine
p180
aVhow do you actually live up to a space like this,
p181
aVan event like this, to actually tell that story.
p182
aa(lp183
VAnd so what we started with
p184
aVwas really a new way of thinking about building an institution,
p185
aVthrough a project called Make History,
p186
aVwhich we launched in 2009.
p187
aVSo it's estimated that a third of the world
p188
aVwatched 9/11 live,
p189
aVand a third of the world
p190
aVheard about it within 24 hours,
p191
aVmaking it really by nature of when it happened,
p192
aVthis unprecedented moment of global awareness.
p193
aVAnd so we launched this to capture the stories
p194
aVfrom all around the world,
p195
aVthrough video, through photos,
p196
aVthrough written history,
p197
aVand so people's experiences on that day,
p198
aVwhich was, in fact, this huge risk for the institution
p199
aVto make its first move this open platform.
p200
aVBut that was coupled together with this oral histories booth,
p201
aVreally the simplest we've ever made,
p202
aVwhere you locate yourself on a map.
p203
aVIt's in six languages, and you can tell your own story
p204
aVabout what happened to you on that day.
p205
aVAnd when we started seeing the incredible images
p206
aVand stories that came forth
p207
aVfrom all around the world \u2014
p208
aVthis is obviously part of the landing gear \u2014
p209
aVwe really started to understand
p210
aVthat there was this amazing symmetry
p211
aVbetween the event itself,
p212
aVbetween the way that people were telling the stories of the event,
p213
aVand how we ourselves needed to tell that story.
p214
aa(lp215
VThis image in particular really captured
p216
aVour attention at the time,
p217
aVbecause it so much sums up that event.
p218
aVThis is a shot from the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel.
p219
aVThere's a firefighter that's stuck, actually, in traffic,
p220
aVand so the firefighters themselves are running
p221
aVa mile and a half to the site itself
p222
aVwith upwards of 70 pounds of gear on their back.
p223
aVAnd we got this amazing email that said,
p224
aV"While viewing the thousands of photos on the site,
p225
aVI unexpectedly found a photo of my son.
p226
aVIt was a shock emotionally, yet a blessing to find this photo,"
p227
aVand he was writing because he said,
p228
aV"I'd like to personally thank the photographer
p229
aVfor posting the photo,
p230
aVas it meant more than words can describe to me
p231
aVto have access to what is probably
p232
aVthe last photo ever taken of my son."
p233
aa(lp234
VAnd it really made us recognize
p235
aVwhat this institution needed to be
p236
aVin order to actually tell that story.
p237
aVWe can't have just a historian or a curator narrating
p238
aVobjectively in the third person about an event like that,
p239
aVwhen you have the witnesses to history
p240
aVwho are going to make their way
p241
aVthrough the actual museum itself.
p242
aa(lp243
VAnd so we started imagining the museum,
p244
aValong with the creative team at the museum and the curators,
p245
aVthinking about how the first voice that you would hear
p246
aVinside the museum would actually be of other visitors.
p247
aVAnd so we created this idea of an opening gallery
p248
aVcalled We Remember.
p249
aVAnd I'll just play you part of a mockup of it,
p250
aVbut you get a sense of what it's like to actually enter
p251
aVinto that moment in time
p252
aVand be transported back in history.
p253
aa(lp254
V(Video) Voice 1: I was in Honolulu, Hawaii. Voice 2: I was in Cairo, Egypt.
p255
aa(lp256
VVoice 3: Sur les Champs-Élysées, à Paris. Voice 4: In college, at U.C. Berkeley.
p257
aa(lp258
VVoice 5: I was in Times Square. Voice 6: São Paolo, Brazil.
p259
aa(lp260
V(Multiple voices)
p261
aa(lp262
VVoice 7: It was probably about 11 o'clock at night.
p263
aa(lp264
VVoice 8: I was driving to work at 5:45 local time in the morning.
p265
aa(lp266
VVoice 9: We were actually in a meeting
p267
aVwhen someone barged in and said,
p268
aV"Oh my God, a plane has just crashed into the World Trade Center."
p269
aa(lp270
VVoice 10: Trying to frantically get to a radio.
p271
aa(lp272
VVoice 11: When I heard it over the radio \u2014
p273
aa(lp274
VVoice 12: Heard it on the radio.
p275
aa(lp276
V(Multiple voices)
p277
aa(lp278
VVoice 13: I got a call from my father. Voice 14: The phone rang, it woke me up.
p279
aVMy business partner told me to turn on the television.
p280
aa(lp281
VVoice 15: So I switched on the television.
p282
aa(lp283
VVoice 16: All channels in Italy were displaying the same thing.
p284
aa(lp285
VVoice 17: The Twin Towers. Voice 18: The Twin Towers.
p286
aa(lp287
VJB: And you move from there
p288
aVinto that open, cavernous space.
p289
aVThis is the so-called slurry wall.
p290
aVIt's the original, excavated wall at the base of the World Trade Center
p291
aVthat withstood the actual pressure from the Hudson River
p292
aVfor a full year after the event itself.
p293
aVAnd so we thought about carrying that sense of authenticity,
p294
aVof presence of that moment
p295
aVinto the actual exhibition itself.
p296
aVAnd we tell the stories of being inside the towers
p297
aVthrough that same audio collage,
p298
aVso you're hearing people literally talking about
p299
aVseeing the planes as they make their way into the building,
p300
aVor making their way down the stairwells.
p301
aVAnd as you make your way into the exhibition
p302
aVwhere it talks about the recovery,
p303
aVwe actually project directly onto these moments
p304
aVof twisted steel all of the experiences from people
p305
aVwho literally excavated on top of the pile itself.
p306
aVAnd so you can hear oral histories \u2014
p307
aVso people who were actually working the so-called bucket brigades
p308
aVas you're seeing literally the thousands of experiences
p309
aVfrom that moment.
p310
aa(lp311
VAnd as you leave that storytelling moment
p312
aVunderstanding about 9/11,
p313
aVwe then turn the museum back into a moment of listening
p314
aVand actually talk to the individual visitors
p315
aVand ask them their own experiences about 9/11.
p316
aVAnd we ask them questions that are actually
p317
aVnot really answerable, the types of questions
p318
aVthat 9/11 itself draws forth for all of us.
p319
aVAnd so these are questions like,
p320
aV"How can a democracy balance freedom and security?"
p321
aV"How could 9/11 have happened?"
p322
aV"And how did the world change after 9/11?"
p323
aa(lp324
VAnd so these oral histories,
p325
aVwhich we've actually been capturing already for years,
p326
aVare then mixed together with interviews
p327
aVthat we're doing with people like Donald Rumsfeld,
p328
aVBill Clinton, Rudy Giuliani,
p329
aVand you mix together these different players
p330
aVand these different experiences,
p331
aVthese different reflection points about 9/11.
p332
aVAnd suddenly the institution, once again,
p333
aVturns into a listening experience.
p334
aVSo I'll play you just a short excerpt
p335
aVof a mockup that we made of a couple of these voices,
p336
aVbut you really get a sense
p337
aVof the poetry of everyone's reflection on the event.
p338
aa(lp339
V(Video) Voice 1: 9/11 was not just a New York experience.
p340
aa(lp341
VVoice 2: It's something that we shared, and it's something that united us.
p342
aa(lp343
VVoice 3: And I knew when I saw that,
p344
aVpeople who were there that day who immediately
p345
aVwent to help people known and unknown to them
p346
aVwas something that would pull us through.
p347
aa(lp348
VVoice 4: All the outpouring of affection and emotion
p349
aVthat came from our country was something really
p350
aVthat will forever, ever stay with me.
p351
aa(lp352
VVoice 5: Still today I pray and think about those
p353
aVwho lost their lives,
p354
aVand those who gave their lives to help others,
p355
aVbut I'm also reminded of the fabric of this country,
p356
aVthe love, the compassIon, the strength,
p357
aVand I watched a nation come together
p358
aVin the middle of a terrible tragedy.
p359
aa(lp360
VJB: And so as people make their way out of the museum,
p361
aVreflecting on the experience, reflecting on their own thoughts of it,
p362
aVthey then move into the actual space of the memorial itself,
p363
aVbecause they've gone back up to grade,
p364
aVand we actually got involved in the memorial
p365
aVafter we'd done the museum for a few years.
p366
aVThe original designer of the memorial, Michael Arad,
p367
aVhad this image in his mind of all the names appearing
p368
aVundifferentiated, almost random,
p369
aVreally a poetic reflection on top of the nature
p370
aVof a terrorism event itself,
p371
aVbut it was a huge challenge for the families, for the foundation,
p372
aVcertainly for the first responders,
p373
aVand there was a negotiation that went forth
p374
aVand a solution was found
p375
aVto actually create not an order in terms of chronology,
p376
aVor in terms of alphabetical,
p377
aVbut through what's called meaningful adjacency.
p378
aVSo these are groupings of the names themselves
p379
aVwhich appear undifferentiated but actually have an order,
p380
aVand we, along with Jer Thorp, created an algorithm
p381
aVto take massive amounts of data
p382
aVto actually start to connect together all these different names themselves.
p383
aVSo this is an image of the actual algorithm itself
p384
aVwith the names scrambled for privacy,
p385
aVbut you can see that these blocks of color
p386
aVare actually the four different flights,
p387
aVthe two different towers, the first responders,
p388
aVand you can actually see within that different floors,
p389
aVand then the green lines are the interpersonal connections
p390
aVthat were requested by the families themselves.
p391
aVAnd so when you go to the memorial,
p392
aVyou can actually see the overarching organization
p393
aVinside of the individual pools themselves.
p394
aVYou can see the way that the geography of the event
p395
aVis reflected inside of the memorial,
p396
aVand you can search for an individual name,
p397
aVor in this case an employer, Cantor Fitzgerald,
p398
aVand see the way in which all of those names,
p399
aVthose hundreds of names, are actually organized
p400
aVonto the memorial itself,
p401
aVand use that to navigate the memorial.
p402
aVAnd more importantly, when you're actually at the site
p403
aVof the memorial, you can see those connections.
p404
aVYou can see the relationships between the different names themselves.
p405
aVSo suddenly what is this undifferentiated, anonymous
p406
aVgroup of names springs into reality as an individual life.
p407
aVIn this case, Harry Ramos,
p408
aVwho was the head trader at an investment bank,
p409
aVwho stopped to aid Victor Wald on the 55th floor of the South Tower.
p410
aVAnd Ramos told Wald, according to witnesses,
p411
aV"I'm not going to leave you."
p412
aVAnd Wald's widow requested that they be listed next to each other.
p413
aa(lp414
VThree generations ago, we had to actually get people
p415
aVto go out and capture the stories for common people.
p416
aVToday, of course, there's an unprecedented amount of stories
p417
aVfor all of us that are being captured for future generations.
p418
aVAnd this is our hope, that's there's poetry inside of each of our stories.
p419
