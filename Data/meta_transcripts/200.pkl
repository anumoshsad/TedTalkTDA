VYou know, I'm struck by how one of the implicit themes of TED
p4
aVis compassion, these very moving demonstrations we've just seen:
p5
aVHIV in Africa, President Clinton last night.
p6
aVAnd I'd like to do a little collateral thinking, if you will,
p7
aVabout compassion and bring it from the global level to the personal.
p8
aVI'm a psychologist, but rest assured,
p9
aVI will not bring it to the scrotal.
p10
aa(lp11
V(Laughter)
p12
aa(lp13
VThere was a very important study done a while ago
p14
aVat Princeton Theological Seminary that speaks to why it is
p15
aVthat when all of us have so many opportunities to help,
p16
aVwe do sometimes, and we don't other times.
p17
aVA group of divinity students at the Princeton Theological Seminary
p18
aVwere told that they were going to give a practice sermon
p19
aVand they were each given a sermon topic.
p20
aVHalf of those students were given, as a topic,
p21
aVthe parable of the Good Samaritan:
p22
aVthe man who stopped the stranger in \u2014
p23
aVto help the stranger in need by the side of the road.
p24
aVHalf were given random Bible topics.
p25
aVThen one by one, they were told they had to go to another building
p26
aVand give their sermon.
p27
aVAs they went from the first building to the second,
p28
aVeach of them passed a man who was bent over and moaning,
p29
aVclearly in need. The question is: Did they stop to help?
p30
aa(lp31
VThe more interesting question is:
p32
aVDid it matter they were contemplating the parable
p33
aVof the Good Samaritan? Answer: No, not at all.
p34
aVWhat turned out to determine whether someone would stop
p35
aVand help a stranger in need
p36
aVwas how much of a hurry they thought they were in \u2014
p37
aVwere they feeling they were late, or were they absorbed
p38
aVin what they were going to talk about.
p39
aVAnd this is, I think, the predicament of our lives:
p40
aVthat we don't take every opportunity to help
p41
aVbecause our focus is in the wrong direction.
p42
aa(lp43
VThere's a new field in brain science, social neuroscience.
p44
aVThis studies the circuitry in two people's brains
p45
aVthat activates while they interact.
p46
aVAnd the new thinking about compassion from social neuroscience
p47
aVis that our default wiring is to help.
p48
aVThat is to say, if we attend to the other person,
p49
aVwe automatically empathize, we automatically feel with them.
p50
aVThere are these newly identified neurons, mirror neurons,
p51
aVthat act like a neuro Wi-Fi, activating in our brain
p52
aVexactly the areas activated in theirs. We feel "with" automatically.
p53
aVAnd if that person is in need, if that person is suffering,
p54
aVwe're automatically prepared to help. At least that's the argument.
p55
aa(lp56
VBut then the question is: Why don't we?
p57
aVAnd I think this speaks to a spectrum
p58
aVthat goes from complete self-absorption,
p59
aVto noticing, to empathy and to compassion.
p60
aVAnd the simple fact is, if we are focused on ourselves,
p61
aVif we're preoccupied, as we so often are throughout the day,
p62
aVwe don't really fully notice the other.
p63
aVAnd this difference between the self and the other focus
p64
aVcan be very subtle.
p65
aa(lp66
VI was doing my taxes the other day, and I got to the point
p67
aVwhere I was listing all of the donations I gave,
p68
aVand I had an epiphany, it was \u2014 I came to my check
p69
aVto the Seva Foundation and I noticed that I thought,
p70
aVboy, my friend Larry Brilliant would really be happy
p71
aVthat I gave money to Seva.
p72
aVThen I realized that what I was getting from giving
p73
aVwas a narcissistic hit \u2014 that I felt good about myself.
p74
aVThen I started to think about the people in the Himalayas
p75
aVwhose cataracts would be helped, and I realized
p76
aVthat I went from this kind of narcissistic self-focus
p77
aVto altruistic joy, to feeling good
p78
aVfor the people that were being helped. I think that's a motivator.
p79
aa(lp80
VBut this distinction between focusing on ourselves
p81
aVand focusing on others
p82
aVis one that I encourage us all to pay attention to.
p83
aVYou can see it at a gross level in the world of dating.
p84
aVI was at a sushi restaurant a while back
p85
aVand I overheard two women talking about the brother of one woman,
p86
aVwho was in the singles scene. And this woman says,
p87
aV"My brother is having trouble getting dates,
p88
aVso he's trying speed dating." I don't know if you know speed dating?
p89
aVWomen sit at tables and men go from table to table,
p90
aVand there's a clock and a bell, and at five minutes, bingo,
p91
aVthe conversation ends and the woman can decide
p92
aVwhether to give her card or her email address to the man
p93
aVfor follow up. And this woman says,
p94
aV"My brother's never gotten a card, and I know exactly why.
p95
aVThe moment he sits down, he starts talking non-stop about himself;
p96
aVhe never asks about the woman."
p97
aa(lp98
VAnd I was doing some research in the Sunday Styles section
p99
aVof The New York Times, looking at the back stories of marriages \u2014
p100
aVbecause they're very interesting \u2014 and I came to the marriage
p101
aVof Alice Charney Epstein. And she said
p102
aVthat when she was in the dating scene,
p103
aVshe had a simple test she put people to.
p104
aVThe test was: from the moment they got together,
p105
aVhow long it would take the guy to ask her a question
p106
aVwith the word "you" in it.
p107
aVAnd apparently Epstein aced the test, therefore the article.
p108
aa(lp109
V(Laughter)
p110
aa(lp111
VNow this is a \u2014 it's a little test
p112
aVI encourage you to try out at a party.
p113
aVHere at TED there are great opportunities.
p114
aVThe Harvard Business Review recently had an article called
p115
aV"The Human Moment," about how to make real contact
p116
aVwith a person at work. And they said, well,
p117
aVthe fundamental thing you have to do is turn off your BlackBerry,
p118
aVclose your laptop, end your daydream
p119
aVand pay full attention to the person.
p120
aVThere is a newly coined word in the English language
p121
aVfor the moment when the person we're with whips out their BlackBerry
p122
aVor answers that cell phone, and all of a sudden we don't exist.
p123
aVThe word is "pizzled": it's a combination of puzzled and pissed off.
p124
aa(lp125
V(Laughter)
p126
aa(lp127
VI think it's quite apt. It's our empathy, it's our tuning in
p128
aVwhich separates us from Machiavellians or sociopaths.
p129
aVI have a brother-in-law who's an expert on horror and terror \u2014
p130
aVhe wrote the Annotated Dracula, the Essential Frankenstein \u2014
p131
aVhe was trained as a Chaucer scholar,
p132
aVbut he was born in Transylvania
p133
aVand I think it affected him a little bit.
p134
aVAt any rate, at one point my brother-in-law, Leonard,
p135
aVdecided to write a book about a serial killer.
p136
aVThis is a man who terrorized the very vicinity we're in
p137
aVmany years ago. He was known as the Santa Cruz strangler.
p138
aVAnd before he was arrested, he had murdered his grandparents,
p139
aVhis mother and five co-eds at UC Santa Cruz.
p140
aa(lp141
VSo my brother-in-law goes to interview this killer
p142
aVand he realizes when he meets him
p143
aVthat this guy is absolutely terrifying.
p144
aVFor one thing, he's almost seven feet tall.
p145
aVBut that's not the most terrifying thing about him.
p146
aVThe scariest thing is that his IQ is 160: a certified genius.
p147
aVBut there is zero correlation between IQ and emotional empathy,
p148
aVfeeling with the other person.
p149
aVThey're controlled by different parts of the brain.
p150
aa(lp151
VSo at one point, my brother-in-law gets up the courage
p152
aVto ask the one question he really wants to know the answer to,
p153
aVand that is: how could you have done it?
p154
aVDidn't you feel any pity for your victims?
p155
aVThese were very intimate murders \u2014 he strangled his victims.
p156
aVAnd the strangler says very matter-of-factly,
p157
aV"Oh no. If I'd felt the distress, I could not have done it.
p158
aVI had to turn that part of me off. I had to turn that part of me off."
p159
aa(lp160
VAnd I think that that is very troubling,
p161
aVand in a sense, I've been reflecting on turning that part of us off.
p162
aVWhen we focus on ourselves in any activity,
p163
aVwe do turn that part of ourselves off if there's another person.
p164
aVThink about going shopping and think about the possibilities
p165
aVof a compassionate consumerism.
p166
aVRight now, as Bill McDonough has pointed out,
p167
aVthe objects that we buy and use have hidden consequences.
p168
aVWe're all unwitting victims of a collective blind spot.
p169
aVWe don't notice and don't notice that we don't notice
p170
aVthe toxic molecules emitted by a carpet or by the fabric on the seats.
p171
aVOr we don't know if that fabric is a technological
p172
aVor manufacturing nutrient; it can be reused
p173
aVor does it just end up at landfill? In other words,
p174
aVwe're oblivious to the ecological and public health
p175
aVand social and economic justice consequences
p176
aVof the things we buy and use.
p177
aVIn a sense, the room itself is the elephant in the room,
p178
aVbut we don't see it. And we've become victims
p179
aVof a system that points us elsewhere. Consider this.
p180
aa(lp181
VThere's a wonderful book called
p182
aVStuff: The Hidden Life of Everyday Objects.
p183
aVAnd it talks about the back story of something like a t-shirt.
p184
aVAnd it talks about where the cotton was grown
p185
aVand the fertilizers that were used and the consequences
p186
aVfor soil of that fertilizer. And it mentions, for instance,
p187
aVthat cotton is very resistant to textile dye;
p188
aVabout 60 percent washes off into wastewater.
p189
aVAnd it's well known by epidemiologists that kids
p190
aVwho live near textile works tend to have high rates of leukemia.
p191
aVThere's a company, Bennett and Company, that supplies Polo.com,
p192
aVVictoria's Secret \u2014 they, because of their CEO, who's aware of this,
p193
aVin China formed a joint venture with their dye works
p194
aVto make sure that the wastewater
p195
aVwould be properly taken care of before it returned to the groundwater.
p196
aVRight now, we don't have the option to choose the virtuous t-shirt
p197
aVover the non-virtuous one. So what would it take to do that?
p198
aa(lp199
VWell, I've been thinking. For one thing,
p200
aVthere's a new electronic tagging technology that allows any store
p201
aVto know the entire history of any item on the shelves in that store.
p202
aVYou can track it back to the factory. Once you can track it
p203
aVback to the factory, you can look at the manufacturing processes
p204
aVthat were used to make it, and if it's virtuous,
p205
aVyou can label it that way. Or if it's not so virtuous,
p206
aVyou can go into \u2014 today, go into any store,
p207
aVput your scanner on a palm onto a barcode,
p208
aVwhich will take you to a website.
p209
aVThey have it for people with allergies to peanuts.
p210
aVThat website could tell you things about that object.
p211
aVIn other words, at point of purchase,
p212
aVwe might be able to make a compassionate choice.
p213
aa(lp214
VThere's a saying in the world of information science:
p215
aVultimately everybody will know everything.
p216
aVAnd the question is: will it make a difference?
p217
aVSome time ago when I was working for The New York Times,
p218
aVit was in the '80s, I did an article
p219
aVon what was then a new problem in New York \u2014
p220
aVit was homeless people on the streets.
p221
aVAnd I spent a couple of weeks going around with a social work agency
p222
aVthat ministered to the homeless. And I realized seeing the homeless
p223
aVthrough their eyes that almost all of them were psychiatric patients
p224
aVthat had nowhere to go. They had a diagnosis. It made me \u2014
p225
aVwhat it did was to shake me out of the urban trance where,
p226
aVwhen we see, when we're passing someone who's homeless
p227
aVin the periphery of our vision, it stays on the periphery.
p228
aVWe don't notice and therefore we don't act.
p229
aa(lp230
VOne day soon after that \u2014 it was a Friday \u2014 at the end of the day,
p231
aVI went down \u2014 I was going down to the subway. It was rush hour
p232
aVand thousands of people were streaming down the stairs.
p233
aVAnd all of a sudden as I was going down the stairs
p234
aVI noticed that there was a man slumped to the side,
p235
aVshirtless, not moving, and people were just stepping over him \u2014
p236
aVhundreds and hundreds of people.
p237
aVAnd because my urban trance had been somehow weakened,
p238
aVI found myself stopping to find out what was wrong.
p239
aVThe moment I stopped, half a dozen other people
p240
aVimmediately ringed the same guy.
p241
aVAnd we found out that he was Hispanic, he didn't speak any English,
p242
aVhe had no money, he'd been wandering the streets for days, starving,
p243
aVand he'd fainted from hunger.
p244
aVImmediately someone went to get orange juice,
p245
aVsomeone brought a hotdog, someone brought a subway cop.
p246
aVThis guy was back on his feet immediately.
p247
aVBut all it took was that simple act of noticing,
p248
aVand so I'm optimistic.
p249
aa(lp250
VThank you very much.
