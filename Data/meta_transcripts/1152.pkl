VSo I think data can actually make us more human.
p4
aVWe're collecting and creating all kinds of data about how we're living our lives,
p5
aVand it's enabling us to tell some amazing stories.
p6
aVRecently, a wise media theorist Tweeted,
p7
aV"The 19th century culture was defined by the novel,
p8
aVthe 20th century culture was defined by the cinema,
p9
aVand the culture of the 21st century
p10
aVwill be defined by the interface."
p11
aVAnd I believe this is going to prove true.
p12
aVOur lives are being driven by data,
p13
aVand the presentation of that data is an opportunity
p14
aVfor us to make some amazing interfaces that tell great stories.
p15
aVSo I'm going to show you a few of the projects
p16
aVthat I've been working on over the last couple years
p17
aVthat reflect on our lives and our systems.
p18
aa(lp19
VThis is a project called Flight Patterns.
p20
aVWhat you're looking at is airplane traffic
p21
aVover North America for a 24-hour period.
p22
aVAs you see, everything starts to fade to black,
p23
aVand you see people going to sleep.
p24
aVFollowed by that, you see on the West coast
p25
aVplanes moving across, the red-eye flights to the East coast.
p26
aVAnd you'll see everybody waking up on the East coast,
p27
aVfollowed by European flights coming in the upper right-hand corner.
p28
aVEverybody's moving from the East coast to the West coast.
p29
aVYou see San Francisco and Los Angeles
p30
aVstart to make their journeys down to Hawaii in the lower left-hand corner.
p31
aa(lp32
VI think it's one thing to say there's 140,000 planes
p33
aVbeing monitored by the federal government at any one time,
p34
aVand it's another thing to see that system as it ebbs and flows.
p35
aVThis is a time-lapse image of that exact same data,
p36
aVbut I've color-coded it by type,
p37
aVso you can see the diversity of aircraft that are in the skies above us.
p38
aVAnd I started making these, and I put them into Google Maps
p39
aVand allow you to zoom in and see individual airports
p40
aVand the patterns that are occurring there.
p41
aVSo here we can see the white represents low altitudes,
p42
aVand the blue are higher altitudes.
p43
aVAnd you can zoom in. This is taking a look at Atlanta.
p44
aVYou can see this is a major shipping airport,
p45
aVand there's all kinds of activity there.
p46
aVYou can also toggle between altitude
p47
aVfor model and manufacturer.
p48
aVSee again, the diversity.
p49
aVAnd you can scroll around and see
p50
aVsome of the different airports and the different patterns that they have.
p51
aVThis is scrolling up the East coast.
p52
aVYou can see some of the chaos that's happening in New York
p53
aVwith the air traffic controllers
p54
aVhaving to deal with all those major airports next to each other.
p55
aa(lp56
VSo zooming back out real quick,
p57
aVwe see, again, the U.S. \u2014 you get Florida down in the right-hand corner.
p58
aVMoving across to the West coast,
p59
aVyou see San Francisco and Los Angeles \u2014
p60
aVbig low-traffic zones
p61
aVacross Nevada and Arizona.
p62
aVAnd that's us down there in L.A. and Long Beach on the bottom.
p63
aVI started taking a look as well at different perimeters,
p64
aVbecause you can choose what you want to pull out from the data.
p65
aVThis is looking at ascending versus descending flights.
p66
aVAnd you can see, over time, the ways the airports change.
p67
aVYou see the holding patterns that start to develop
p68
aVin the bottom of the screen.
p69
aVAnd you can see, eventually the airport actually flips directions.
p70
aa(lp71
VSo this is another project that I worked on with the Sensible Cities Lab at MIT.
p72
aVThis is visualizing international communications.
p73
aVSo it's how New York communicates
p74
aVwith other international cities.
p75
aVAnd we set this up as a live globe in the Museum of Modern Art in New York
p76
aVfor the Design the Elastic Mind exhibition.
p77
aVAnd it had a live feed with a 24-hour offset,
p78
aVso you could see the changing relationship
p79
aVand some demographic info
p80
aVcoming through AT&T's data and revealing itself.
p81
aVThis is another project I worked on with Sensible Cities Lab
p82
aVand CurrentCity.org.
p83
aVAnd it's visualizing SMS messages being sent in the city of Amsterdam.
p84
aVSo you're seeing the daily ebb and flow
p85
aVof people sending SMS messages from different parts of the city,
p86
aVuntil we approach New Year's Eve, where everybody says, "Happy New Year!"
p87
aa(lp88
V(Laughter)
p89
aa(lp90
VSo this is an interactive tool
p91
aVthat you can move around and see different parts of the city.
p92
aVThis is looking at another event. This is called Queen's Day.
p93
aVSo again, you get this daily ebb and flow
p94
aVof people sending SMS messages from different parts of the city.
p95
aVAnd then you're going to see people start to gather in the center of the city
p96
aVto celebrate the night before,
p97
aVwhich happens right here.
p98
aVAnd then you can see people celebrating the next day.
p99
aVAnd you can pause it and step back and forth and see different phases.
p100
aa(lp101
VSo now on to something completely different.
p102
aVSome of you may recognize this.
p103
aVThis is Baron Wolfgang von Kempelen's mechanical chess playing machine.
p104
aVAnd it's this amazing robot that plays chess extremely well,
p105
aVexcept for one thing: it's not a robot at all.
p106
aVThere's actually a legless man that sits in that box
p107
aVand controls this chess player.
p108
aVThis was the inspiration for a web service by Amazon
p109
aVcalled the Mechanical Turk \u2014 named after this guy.
p110
aVAnd it's based on the premise that there are certain things
p111
aVthat are easy for people, but really difficult for computers.
p112
aVSo they made this web service and said,
p113
aV"Any programmer can write a piece of software
p114
aVand tap into the minds of thousands of people."
p115
aVThe nerdy side of me thought, "Wow, this is amazing.
p116
aVI can tap into thousands of people's minds."
p117
aVAnd the other nerdy side of me thought,
p118
aV"This is horrible. This is completely bizarre.
p119
aVWhat does this mean for the future of mankind,
p120
aVwhere we're all plugged into this borg?"
p121
aVI was probably being a little extreme.
p122
aVBut what does this mean when we have no context for what it is that we're working on,
p123
aVand we're just doing these little labors?
p124
aa(lp125
VSo I created this drawing tool.
p126
aVI asked people to draw a sheep facing to the left.
p127
aVAnd I said, "I'll pay you two cents for your contribution."
p128
aVAnd I started collecting sheep.
p129
aVAnd I collected a lot, a lot of different sheep.
p130
aVLots of sheep.
p131
aVI took the first 10,000 sheep that I collected,
p132
aVand I put them on a website called TheSheepMarket.com
p133
aVwhere you can actually buy collections of 20 sheep.
p134
aVYou can't pick individual sheep,
p135
aVbut you can buy a single plate block of stamps as a commodity.
p136
aVAnd juxtaposed against this grid,
p137
aVyou see actually, by rolling over each individual one,
p138
aVthe humanity behind this hugely mechanical process.
p139
aVI think there's something really interesting
p140
aVto watching people as they go through this creative toil \u2014
p141
aVsomething we can all relate to,
p142
aVthis creative process of trying to come up with something from nothing.
p143
aVI think it was really interesting to juxtapose this humanity
p144
aVversus this massive distributed grid.
p145
aVKind of amazing what some people did.
p146
aa(lp147
VSo here's a few statistics from the project.
p148
aVApproximate collection rate of 11 sheep per hour,
p149
aVwhich would make a working wage of 69 cents per hour.
p150
aVThere were 662 rejected sheep
p151
aVthat didn't meet "sheep-like" criteria and were thrown out of the flock.
p152
aV(Laughter)
p153
aVThe amount of time spent drawing ranged from four seconds to 46 minutes.
p154
aVThat gives you an idea of the different types of motivations and dedication.
p155
aVAnd there were 7,599 people that contributed to the project,
p156
aVor were unique IP addresses \u2014
p157
aVso about how many people contributed.
p158
aVBut only one of them out of the 7,599 said this.
p159
aV(Laughter)
p160
aVWhich I was pretty surprised by.
p161
aVI expected people to be wondering, "Why did I draw a sheep?"
p162
aVAnd I think it's a pretty valid question.
p163
aa(lp164
VAnd there's a lot of reasons why I chose sheep.
p165
aVSheep were the first animal
p166
aVto be raised from mechanically processed byproducts,
p167
aVthe first to be selectively bred for production traits,
p168
aVthe first animal to be cloned.
p169
aVObviously, we think of sheep as followers.
p170
aVAnd there's this reference to "Le Petit Prince"
p171
aVwhere the narrator asks the prince to draw a sheep.
p172
aVHe draws sheep after sheep.
p173
aVThe narrator's only appeased when he draws a box.
p174
aVAnd he says, "It's not about a scientific rendering of a sheep.
p175
aVIt's about your own interpretation and doing something different."
p176
aVAnd I like that.
p177
aa(lp178
VSo this is a clip from Charlie Chaplin's "Modern Times."
p179
aVIt's showing Charlie Chaplin dealing with some of the major changes
p180
aVduring the Industrial Revolution.
p181
aVSo there were no longer shoe makers,
p182
aVbut now there are people slapping soles on people's shoes.
p183
aVAnd the whole idea of one's relationship to their work changed a lot.
p184
aVSo I thought this was an interesting clip
p185
aVto divide into 16 pieces
p186
aVand feed into the Mechanical Turk with a drawing tool.
p187
aVThis basically allowed \u2014 what you see on the left side is the original frame,
p188
aVand on the right side you see that frame
p189
aVas interpreted by 16 people
p190
aVwho have no idea what it is they're doing.
p191
aa(lp192
VAnd this was the inspiration for a project
p193
aVthat I worked on with my friend Takashi Kawashima.
p194
aVWe decided to use the Mechanical Turk for exactly what it was meant for,
p195
aVwhich is making money.
p196
aVSo we took a hundred dollar bill and divided it into 10,000 teeny pieces,
p197
aVand we fed those into the Mechanical Turk.
p198
aVWe asked people to draw what it was that they saw.
p199
aVBut here there was no sheep-like criteria.
p200
aVPeople, if they drew a stick figure or a smiley face,
p201
aVit actually made it into the bill.
p202
aVSo what you see is actually a representation of how well people did
p203
aVwhat it was they were asked to do.
p204
aVSo we took these hundred dollar bills,
p205
aVand we put them on a website called TenThousandsCents.com,
p206
aVwhere you can browse through and see all the individual contributions.
p207
aVAnd you can also trade real hundred-dollar bills for fake hundred-dollar bills
p208
aVand make a donation to the Hundred Dollar Laptop Project,
p209
aVwhich is now known as One Laptop Per Child.
p210
aVThis is again showing all the different contributions.
p211
aVYou see some people did beautiful stipple renderings,
p212
aVlike this one on top \u2014
p213
aVspent a long time making realistic versions.
p214
aVAnd other people would draw stick figures or smiley faces.
p215
aVHere on the right-hand side in the middle
p216
aVyou see this one guy writing, "$0.01!!! Really?"
p217
aVThat's all I'm getting paid for this?
p218
aa(lp219
V(Laughter)
p220
aa(lp221
VSo the last Mechanical Turk project I'm going to talk to you about
p222
aVis called Bicycle Built for 2000.
p223
aVThis is a collaboration with my friend Daniel Massey.
p224
aVYou may recognize these two guys.
p225
aVThis is Max Mathews and John Kelly from Bell Labs in the '60s,
p226
aVwhere they created the song "Daisy Bell,"
p227
aVwhich was the world's first singing computer.
p228
aVYou may recognize it from "2001: A Space Odyssey."
p229
aVWhen HAL's dying at the end of the film he starts singing this song,
p230
aVas a reference to when computers became human.
p231
aVSo we resynthesized this song.
p232
aVThis is what that sounded like.
p233
aVWe broke down all the individual notes
p234
aVin the singing as well as the phonemes in the singing.
p235
aa(lp236
VDaisy Bell: \u266b Daisy, Daisy ... \u266b
p237
aa(lp238
VAaron Koblin: And we took all of those individual pieces,
p239
aVand we fed them into another Turk request.
p240
aVThis is what it would look like if you went to the site.
p241
aVYou type in your code,
p242
aVbut you first test your mic.
p243
aVYou'd be fed a simple audio clip.
p244
aV(Honk)
p245
aVAnd then you'd do your best to recreate that with your own voice.
p246
aVAfter previewing it and confirming it's what you submitted,
p247
aVyou could submit it into the Mechanical Turk with no other context.
p248
aVAnd this is what we first got back from the very first set of submissions.
p249
aa(lp250
VRecording: \u266b Daisy, Daisy \u266b
p251
aV\u266b give me your answer do \u266b
p252
aV\u266b I'm half crazy \u266b
p253
aV\u266b all for the love of you \u266b
p254
aV\u266b It can't be a stylish marriage \u266b
p255
aV\u266b I can't afford a carriage \u266b
p256
aV\u266b But you'll look sweet upon the seat \u266b
p257
aV\u266b of a bicycle built for two \u266b
p258
aa(lp259
VAK: So James Surowieki has this idea of the wisdom of crowds,
p260
aVthat says that a whole bunch of people are smarter than any individual.
p261
aVWe wanted to see how this applies to collaborative, distributed music making,
p262
aVwhere nobody has any idea what it is they're working on.
p263
aVSo if you go to the BicycleBuiltforTwoThousand.com
p264
aVyou can actually hear what all this sounds like together.
p265
aVI'm sorry for this.
p266
aa(lp267
V(Noise)
p268
aa(lp269
VChorus: \u266b Daisy, Daisy \u266b
p270
aV\u266b Give me your answer do \u266b
p271
aV\u266b I'm half crazy \u266b
p272
aV\u266b all for the love of you \u266b
p273
aV\u266b It can't be a stylish marriage \u266b
p274
aV\u266b I can't afford a carriage \u266b
p275
aV\u266b But you'd look sweet upon the seat \u266b
p276
aV\u266b of a bicycle built for two \u266b
p277
aa(lp278
VAK: So stepping back for a quick second,
p279
aVwhen I was at UCLA going to grad school,
p280
aVI was also working at a place called the Center for Embedded Network Sensing.
p281
aVAnd I was writing software to visualize laser scanners.
p282
aVSo basically motion through 3D space.
p283
aVAnd this was seen by a director in L.A. named James Frost
p284
aVwho said, "Wait a minute.
p285
aVYou mean we can shoot a music video without actually using any video?"
p286
aVSo we did exactly that.
p287
aVWe made a music video for one of my favorite bands, Radiohead.
p288
aVAnd I think one of my favorite parts of this project
p289
aVwas not just shooting a video with lasers,
p290
aVbut we also open sourced it,
p291
aVand we made it released as a Google Code project,
p292
aVwhere people could download a bunch of the data and some source code
p293
aVto build their own versions of it.
p294
aVAnd people were making some amazing things.
p295
aVThis is actually two of my favorites:
p296
aVthe pin-board Thom Yorke and a LEGO Thom Yorke.
p297
aVA whole YouTube channel of people submitting really interesting content.
p298
aVMore recently, somebody even 3D-printed Thom Yorke's head,
p299
aVwhich is a little creepy, but pretty cool.
p300
aa(lp301
VSo with everybody making so much amazing stuff
p302
aVand actually understanding what it was they were working on,
p303
aVI was really interested in trying to make a collaborative project
p304
aVwhere people were working together to build something.
p305
aVAnd I met a music video director named Chris Milk.
p306
aVAnd we started bouncing around ideas
p307
aVto make a collaborative music video project.
p308
aVBut we knew we really needed the right person
p309
aVto kind of rally behind and build something for.
p310
aVSo we put the idea on the back burner for a few months.
p311
aVAnd he ended up talking to Rick Rubin,
p312
aVwho was finishing up Johnny Cash's final album
p313
aVcalled "Ain't No Grave."
p314
aVThe lyrics to the leading track are "Ain't no grave can hold my body down."
p315
aVSo we thought this was the perfect
p316
aVproject to build a collaborative memorial
p317
aVand a virtual resurrection for Johnny Cash.
p318
aa(lp319
VSo I teamed up with my good friend Ricardo Cabello, also known as Mr. doob,
p320
aVwho's a much better programmer than I am,
p321
aVand he made this amazing Flash drawing tool.
p322
aVAs you know,
p323
aVan animation is a series of images.
p324
aVSo what we did was cross-cut a bunch of archival footage of Johnny Cash,
p325
aVand at eight frames a second,
p326
aVwe allowed individuals to draw a single frame
p327
aVthat would get woven into
p328
aVthis dynamically changing music video.
p329
aVSo I don't have time to play the entire thing for you,
p330
aVbut I want to show you two short clips.
p331
aVOne is the beginning of the music video.
p332
aVAnd that's going to be followed by a short clip
p333
aVof people who have already contributed to the project
p334
aVtalking about it briefly.
p335
aa(lp336
V(Music)
p337
aa(lp338
V(Video) Johnny Cash: \u266b There ain't no grave \u266b
p339
aV\u266b can hold my body down \u266b
p340
aV\u266b There ain't no grave \u266b
p341
aV\u266b can hold body down \u266b
p342
aV\u266b When I hear the trumpet sound \u266b
p343
aV\u266b I'm going to ride right out of the ground \u266b
p344
aV\u266b Ain't no grave \u266b
p345
aV\u266b can hold my body ... \u266b
p346
aa(lp347
V(Applause)
p348
aa(lp349
VAK: What better way to pay tribute to the man
p350
aVthan to make something for one of his songs.
p351
aa(lp352
VCollaborator: I felt really sad when he died.
p353
aVAnd I just thought it'd be wonderful,
p354
aVit'd be really nice to contribute something to his memory.
p355
aa(lp356
VCollaborator Two: It really allows
p357
aVthis last recording of his
p358
aVto be a living, breathing memorial.
p359
aa(lp360
VCollaborator Three: For all of the frames to be drawn by fans,
p361
aVeach individual frame,
p362
aVit's got a very powerful feeling to it.
p363
aa(lp364
VCollaborator Four: I've seen everybody
p365
aVfrom Japan, Venezuela, to the States,
p366
aVto Knoxville, Tennessee.
p367
aa(lp368
VCollaborator Five: As much as is different from frame to frame,
p369
aVit really is personal.
p370
aVCollaborator Six: Watching the video in my room,
p371
aVI could see me not understanding at the beginning of it.
p372
aVAnd I just worked and worked through problems,
p373
aVuntil my little wee battles that I was fighting within the picture
p374
aVall began to resolve themselves.
p375
aVYou can actually see the point when I know what I'm doing,
p376
aVand a lot of light and dark comes into it.
p377
aVAnd in a weird way,
p378
aVthat's what I actually like about Johnny Cash's music as well.
p379
aVIt's the sum total of his life,
p380
aVall the things that had happened \u2014
p381
aVthe bad things, the good things.
p382
aVYou're hearing a person's life.
p383
aa(lp384
VAK: So if you go to the website JohnnyCashProject.com,
p385
aVwhat you'll see is the video playing above.
p386
aVAnd below it are all the individual frames
p387
aVthat people have been submitting to the project.
p388
aVSo this isn't finished at all,
p389
aVbut it's an ongoing project where people can continue to collaborate.
p390
aVIf you roll over any one of those individual thumbnails,
p391
aVyou can see the person who drew that individual thumbnail
p392
aVand where they were located.
p393
aVAnd if you find one that you're interested in,
p394
aVyou can actually click on it and open up an information panel
p395
aVwhere you're able to rate that frame,
p396
aVwhich helps it bubble up to the top.
p397
aVAnd you can also see the way that it was drawn.
p398
aVAgain, you can get the playback and personal contribution.
p399
aVIn addition to that, it's listed, the artist's name, the location,
p400
aVhow long they spent drawing it.
p401
aVAnd you can pick a style. So this one was tagged "Abstract."
p402
aVBut there's a bunch of different styles.
p403
aVAnd you can sort the video a number of different ways.
p404
aVYou can say, "I want to see the pointillist version
p405
aVor the sketchy version or the realistic version.
p406
aVAnd then this is, again, the abstract version,
p407
aVwhich ends up getting a little bit crazy.
p408
aa(lp409
VSo the last project I want to talk to you about is another collaboration with Chris Milk.
p410
aVAnd this is called "The Wilderness Downtown."
p411
aVIt's an online music video for the Arcade Fire.
p412
aVChris and I were really amazed
p413
aVby the potential now with modern web browsers,
p414
aVwhere you have HTML5 audio and video
p415
aVand the power of JavaScript to render amazingly fast.
p416
aVAnd we wanted to push the idea of the music video that was meant for the Web
p417

aVand try to make it play out and choreograph throughout the screen.
p419
aVBut most importantly, I think,
p420
aVwe really wanted to make an experience that was unlike the Johnny Cash Project,
p421
aVwhere you had a small group of people spending a lot of time
p422
aVto contribute something for everyone.
p423
aVWhat if we had a very low commitment,
p424
aVbut delivered something individually unique to each person who contributed?
p425
aa(lp426
VSo the project starts off by asking you to enter the address
p427
aVof the home where you grew up.
p428
aVAnd you type in the address \u2014
p429
aVit actually creates a music video specifically for you,
p430
aVpulling in Google maps and Streetview images
p431
aVinto the experience itself.
p432
aVSo this should really be seen at home with you typing in your own address,
p433
aVbut I'm going to give you a little preview of what you can expect.

VAK: So I think, if there's one thing to take away from my talk today,
p450
aVit's that an interface can be a powerful narrative device.
p451
aVAnd as we collect more and more personally and socially relevant data,
p452
aVwe have an opportunity, and maybe even an obligation,
p453
aVto maintain the humanity and tell some amazing stories
p454
aVas we explore and collaborate together.
