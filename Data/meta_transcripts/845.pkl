VMost of the talks
p4
aVthat you've heard in the last several fabulous days
p5
aVhave been from people who have the characteristic
p6
aVthat they have thought about something,
p7
aVthey are experts, they know what's going on.
p8
aVAll of you know about the topic
p9
aVthat I'm supposed to talk about.
p10
aVThat is, you know what simplicity is,
p11
aVyou know what complexity is.
p12
aVThe trouble is, I don't.
p13
aVAnd what I'm going to do is share with you
p14
aVmy ignorance on this subject.
p15
aa(lp16
VI want you to read this,
p17
aVbecause we're going to come back to it in a moment.
p18
aVThe quote is from
p19
aVthe fabled Potter Stewart
p20
aVopinion on pornography.
p21
aVAnd let me just read it,
p22
aVthe important details here:
p23
aV"Shorthand description, ['hardcore pornography'];
p24
aVand perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly defining it.
p25
aVBut I know it when I see it."
p26
aVI'm going to come back to that in a moment.
p27
aa(lp28
VSo, what is simplicity?
p29
aVIt's good to start with some examples.
p30
aVA coffee cup \u2014 we don't think about coffee cups,
p31
aVbut it's much more interesting than one might think \u2014
p32
aVa coffee cup is a device,
p33
aVwhich has a container and a handle.
p34
aVThe handle enables you to hold it
p35
aVwhen the container is filled with hot liquid.
p36
aVWhy is that important?
p37
aVWell, it enables you to drink coffee.
p38
aVBut also, by the way, the coffee is hot,
p39
aVthe liquid is sterile;
p40
aVyou're not likely to get cholera that way.
p41
aVSo the coffee cup, or the cup with a handle,
p42
aVis one of the tools used by society
p43
aVto maintain public health.
p44
aVScissors are your clothes,
p45
aVglasses enable you to see things
p46
aVand keep you from being eaten by cheetahs
p47
aVor run down by automobiles,
p48
aVand books are, after all, your education.
p49
aa(lp50
VBut there's another class of simple things,
p51
aVwhich are also very important.
p52
aVSimple in function,
p53
aVbut not at all simple in how they're constructed.
p54
aVAnd the two here are just examples.
p55
aVOne is the cellphone, which we use every day.
p56
aVAnd it rests on a complexity,
p57
aVwhich has some characteristics
p58
aVvery different from those that my friend
p59
aVBenoit Mandelbrot discussed,
p60
aVbut are very interesting.
p61
aVAnd the other, of course, is a birth control pill,
p62
aVwhich, in a very simple way,
p63
aVfundamentally changed the structure of society
p64
aVby changing the role of women in it
p65
aVby providing to them
p66
aVthe opportunity to make reproductive choices.
p67
aa(lp68
VSo, there are two ways of thinking about this word, I think.
p69
aVAnd here I've corrupted
p70
aVthe Potter Stewart quotation
p71
aVby saying that we can think about something \u2014
p72
aVwhich spans all the way from scissors
p73
aVto the cell phone,
p74
aVInternet and birth control pills \u2014
p75
aVby saying that they're simple,
p76
aVthe functions are simple,
p77
aVand we recognize what that simplicity is
p78
aVwhen we see it.
p79
aa(lp80
VOr there may be another way of doing it,
p81
aVwhich is to think about the problem in terms of what \u2014
p82
aVif you associate with moral philosophers \u2014
p83
aVis called the teapot problem.
p84
aVThe teapot problem I'll pose this way.
p85
aVSuppose you see a teapot,
p86
aVand the teapot is
p87
aVfilled with hot water.
p88
aVAnd you then ask the question:
p89
aVWhy is the water hot?
p90
aVAnd that's a simple question.
p91
aVIt's like, what is simplicity?
p92
aVOne answer would be:
p93
aVbecause the kinetic energy of the water molecules is high
p94
aVand they bounce against things rapidly \u2014
p95
aVthat's a kind of physical science argument.
p96
aVA second argument would be:
p97
aVbecause it was sitting on a stove with the flame on \u2014
p98
aVthat's an historical argument.
p99
aVA third is that I wanted hot water
p100
aVfor tea \u2014
p101
aVthat's an intentional argument.
p102
aVAnd, since this is coming from a moral philosopher,
p103
aVthe fourth would be that it's part of God's plan for the universe.
p104
aVAll of these are possibilities.
p105
aa(lp106
VThe point is that you get into trouble
p107
aVwhen you ask a single question
p108
aVwith a single box for an answer,
p109
aVin which that single question actually is many questions
p110
aVwith quite different meanings,
p111
aVbut with the same words.
p112
aVAsking, "What is simplicity?" I think falls in that category.
p113
aVWhat is the state of science?
p114
aVAnd, interestingly, complexity
p115
aVis very highly evolved.
p116
aVWe have a lot of interesting information
p117
aVabout what complexity is.
p118
aVSimplicity, for reasons
p119
aVthat are a little bit obscure,
p120
aVis almost not pursued,
p121
aVat least in the academic world.
p122
aa(lp123
VWe academics \u2014 I am an academic \u2014
p124
aVwe love complexity.
p125
aVYou can write papers about complexity,
p126
aVand the nice thing about complexity is
p127
aVit's fundamentally intractable in many ways,
p128
aVso you're not responsible for outcomes. (Laughter)
p129
aVSimplicity \u2014 all of you really would like
p130
aVyour Waring Blender in the morning
p131
aVto make whatever a Waring Blender does,
p132
aVbut not explode or play Beethoven.
p133
aVYou're not interested in the limits of these things.
p134
aVSo what one is interested in
p135
aVhas a lot to do with the rewards of the system.
p136
aVAnd there's a lot of rewards in thinking
p137
aVabout complexity and emergence,
p138
aVnot so much in thinking about simplicity.
p139
aVOne of the things I want to do
p140
aVis to help you with a very important task \u2014
p141
aVwhich you may not know that you have very often \u2014
p142
aVwhich is to understand
p143
aVhow to sit next to a physicist at a dinner party
p144
aVand have a conversation. (Laughter)
p145
aVAnd the words that I would like you to focus on
p146
aVare complexity and emergence,
p147
aVbecause these will enable you to start the conversation
p148
aVand then daydream about other things.
p149
aa(lp150
V(Laughter)
p151
aa(lp152
VAll right, what is complexity in this view of things,
p153
aVand what is emergence?
p154
aVWe have, actually, a pretty good working definition of complexity.
p155
aVIt is a system, like traffic,
p156
aVwhich has components.
p157
aVThe components interact with one another.
p158
aVThese are cars and drivers. They dissipate energy.
p159
aVIt turns out that, whenever you have that system,
p160
aVweird stuff happens,
p161
aVand you in Los Angeles
p162
aVprobably know this better than anyone.
p163
aVHere's another example,
p164
aVwhich I put up because
p165
aVit's an example of really important current science.
p166
aVYou can't possibly read that. It's not intended that you read it,
p167
aVbut that's a tiny part
p168
aVof the chemical reactions going on
p169
aVin each of your cells at any given moment.
p170
aVAnd it's like the traffic that you see.
p171
aVThe amazing thing about the cell is that
p172
aVit actually does maintain a fairly stable
p173
aVworking relationship with other cells,
p174
aVbut we don't know why.
p175
aVAnyone who tells you that we understand life,
p176
aVwalk away.
p177
aa(lp178
VAnd let me reduce this to the simplest level.
p179
aVWe've heard from Bill Gates recently.
p180
aVAll of us, to some extent, study
p181
aVthis thing called a Bill Gates.
p182
aVTerrific. You learn everything you can about that.
p183
aVAnd then there's another kind of thing that you might study,
p184
aVand you study that hard.
p185
aVThat's a Bono, this is a Bono.
p186
aVBut then, if you know everything you can know about those two things,
p187
aVand you put them together,
p188
aVwhat can you say about this combination?
p189
aVThe answer is, not a lot.
p190
aVAnd that's complexity.
p191
aVNow, imagine building that up to a city, or to a society,
p192
aVand you've got, obviously, an interesting problem.
p193
aa(lp194
VAll right, so let me give you an example
p195
aVof simplicity
p196
aVof a particular kind.
p197
aVAnd I want to introduce a word
p198
aVthat I think is very useful,
p199
aVwhich is stacking.
p200
aVAnd I'm going to use stacking for a kind of simplicity
p201
aVthat has the characteristic
p202
aVthat it is so simple
p203
aVand so reliable
p204
aVthat I can build things with it.
p205
aVOr I'm going to use simple to mean
p206
aVreliable, predictable, repeatable.
p207
aVAnd I'm going to use as an example the Internet,
p208
aVbecause it's a particularly good example
p209
aVof stacked simplicity.
p210
aVWe call it a complex system, which it is,
p211
aVbut it's also something else.
p212
aa(lp213
VThe Internet starts with mathematics,
p214
aVit starts with binary.
p215
aVAnd if you look at the list of things on the bottom,
p216
aVwe are familiar with the Arabic numbers
p217
aVone to 10 and so on.
p218
aVIn binary, one is 0001,
p219
aVseven is 0111.
p220
aVThe question is: Why is binary
p221
aVsimpler than Arabic?
p222
aVAnd the answer is, simply,
p223
aVthat if I hold up three fingers, you can count that easily,
p224
aVbut if I hold up this,
p225
aVit's sort of hard to say that I just did seven.
p226
aVThe virtue of binary is that it's the simplest possible way
p227
aVof representing numbers.
p228
aVAnything else is more complicated.
p229
aVYou can catch errors with it,
p230
aVit's unambiguous in its reading,
p231
aVthere are lots of good things about binary.
p232
aVSo it is very, very simple
p233
aVonce you learn how to read it.
p234
aVNow, if you like to represent
p235
aVthis zero and one of binary,
p236
aVyou need a device.
p237
aVAnd think of things in your life
p238
aVthat are binary,
p239
aVone of them is light switches.
p240
aVThey can be on and off. That's binary.
p241
aa(lp242
VNow wall switches, we all know, fail.
p243
aVBut our friends who are condensed matter physicists
p244
aVmanaged to come up, some 50 years ago,
p245
aVwith a very nice device, shown under that bell jar,
p246
aVwhich is a transistor.
p247
aVA transistor is nothing more than a wall switch.
p248
aVIt turns things on and off,
p249
aVbut it does so without moving parts
p250
aVand it doesn't fail, basically, for a very long period of time.
p251
aVSo the second layer of simplicity
p252
aVwas the transistor in the Internet.
p253
aVSo, since the transistor is so simple,
p254
aVyou can put lots of them together.
p255
aVAnd you put lots of them together and you come with
p256
aVsomething called integrated circuits.
p257
aVAnd a current integrated circuit
p258
aVmight have in each one of these chips
p259
aVsomething like a billion transistors,
p260
aVall of which have to work perfectly every time.
p261
aVSo that's the next layer of simplicity,
p262
aVand, in fact, integrated circuits
p263
aVare really simple in the sense that they,
p264
aVin general, work really well.
p265
aa(lp266
VWith integrated circuits, you can build cellphones.
p267
aVYou all are accustomed to having your cellphones work
p268
aVthe large majority of the time.
p269
aVIn Boston ... Boston is a little bit like Namibia
p270
aVin its cell phone coverage, (Laughter)
p271
aVso that we're not accustomed to that all the time,
p272
aVbut some of the time.
p273
aVBut, in fact, if you have cell phones,
p274
aVyou can now go to this nice lady
p275
aVwho's somewhere like Namibia,
p276
aVand who is extremely happy with the fact
p277
aVthat although she does not have
p278
aVan master's degree in
p279
aVelectrical engineering from MIT,
p280
aVshe's nonetheless able to hack her cell phone
p281
aVto get power in some funny way.
p282
aVAnd from that comes the Internet.
p283
aVAnd this is a map of bitflows across the continent.
p284
aVThe two blobs that are light in the middle there
p285
aVare the United States and Europe.
p286
aa(lp287
VAnd then back to simplicity again.
p288
aVSo here we have what I think is one of the great ideas,
p289
aVwhich is Google.
p290
aVWhich, in this simple portal
p291
aVmakes the claim
p292
aVthat it makes accessible
p293
aVall of the world's information.
p294
aVBut the point is that
p295
aVthat extraordinary simple idea
p296
aVrests on layers of simplicity
p297
aVeach compounded into a complexity
p298
aVthat is itself simple,
p299
aVin the sense that it is completely reliable.
p300
aa(lp301
VAll right, let me then finish off
p302
aVwith four general statements,
p303
aVan example and two aphorisms.
p304
aVThe characteristics, which I think
p305
aVare useful to think about for simple things:
p306
aVFirst, they are predictable.
p307
aVTheir behavior is predictable.
p308
aVNow, one of the nice characteristics
p309
aVof simple things
p310
aVis you know what it's going to do, in general.
p311
aVSo simplicity and predictability
p312
aVare characteristics of simple things.
p313
aVThe second is, and this is a real world statement,
p314
aVthey're cheap.
p315
aVIf you have things that are cheap enough,
p316
aVpeople will find uses for them,
p317
aVeven if they seem very primitive.
p318
aVSo, for example, stones.
p319
aVYou can build cathedrals out of stones,
p320
aVyou just have to know what it does.
p321
aVYou carve them in blocks and then you
p322
aVpile them on top of one another,
p323
aVand they support weight.
p324
aa(lp325
VSo there has to be function, the function has to be predictable
p326
aVand the cost has to be low.
p327
aVWhat that means is
p328
aVthat you have to have a high performance
p329
aVor value for cost.
p330
aVAnd then I would propose
p331
aVas this last component
p332
aVthat they serve, or have the potential to serve,
p333
aVas building blocks.
p334
aVThat is, you can stack them.
p335
aVAnd stack can mean this way, or it can mean this way,
p336
aVor it can mean in some arbitrary n-dimensional space.
p337
aVBut if you have something that has a function,
p338
aVand it's really cheap,
p339
aVpeople will find new ways of putting it together
p340
aVto make new things.
p341
aVCheap, functional, reliable things
p342
aVunleash the creativity of people
p343
aVwho then build stuff that you could not imagine.
p344
aVThere's no way of predicting the Internet
p345
aVbased on the first transistor.
p346
aVIt just is not possible.
p347
aVSo these are the components.
p348
aa(lp349
VNow, the example
p350
aVis something that I want to give you
p351
aVfrom the work that we ourselves do.
p352
aVWe are very interested in
p353
aVdelivering health care in the developing world,
p354
aVand one of the things that we wish to do in this particular business
p355
aVis to find a way of doing medical diagnosis
p356
aVat as close to zero cost
p357
aVas we can manage.
p358
aVSo, how does one do that?
p359
aVThis is a world in which there's no electricity,
p360
aVthere's no money, there's no medical competence.
p361
aVAnd I don't want to spend your time in going through the details,
p362
aVbut in the lower right-hand corner,
p363
aVyou see an example of the kind of thing that we have.
p364
aVIt's a little paper chip.
p365
aVIt has a few things printed on it
p366
aVusing the same technology
p367
aVthat you use for making comic books,
p368
aVwhich was the inspiration for this particular idea.
p369
aVAnd you put a drop, in this case, of urine at the bottom.
p370
aVIt wicks its way up into these little branches.
p371
aVYou know, no power required.
p372
aVIt turns colors. In this particular case,
p373
aVyou're reading kidney function.
p374
aVAnd, since the health care worker
p375
aVof much of this part of the world
p376
aVis an 18 year-old with an AK-47,
p377
aVwho happens to be out of work and is willing
p378
aVto go around and do this sort of thing,
p379
aVhe can take a picture of it with his cellphone,
p380
aVsend the picture back to where there is a doctor,
p381
aVand the doctor can look at it.
p382
aa(lp383
VSo what you've done is to take a technology,
p384
aVwhich is available everywhere,
p385
aVmake a device, which is extremely cheap,
p386
aVand make it in such a fashion
p387
aVthat it is very, very reliable.
p388
aVIf we can pull this off,
p389
aVif we can build more function,
p390
aVit will be stackable.
p391
aVThat is to say, if we can make the basic technology
p392
aVof one or two things work,
p393
aVit will be applicable to a very, very
p394
aVlarge variety of human conditions,
p395
aVand hence, extendable in both
p396
aVvertical and horizontal directions.
p397
aVPart of my interest in this, I have to say,
p398
aVis that I would like to \u2014 how do I put this politely? \u2014
p399
aVchange the way, or maybe eviscerate,
p400
aVthe capital structure of the U.S. health care system,
p401
aVwhich I think is fundamentally broken.
p402
aa(lp403
VSo, let me close \u2014
p404
aV(Applause)
p405
aa(lp406
VLet me close with my two aphorisms.
p407
aVOne of them is from Mr. Einstein,
p408
aVand he says, "Everything should be made
p409
aVas simple as possible, but not simpler."
p410
aVAnd I think that's a very good way of thinking about the problem.
p411
aVIf you take too much out
p412
aVof something that's simple, you lose function.
p413
aVYou have to have low cost,
p414
aVbut you also have to have a function.
p415
aVSo you can't make it too simple.
p416
aVAnd the second is a design issue,
p417
aVand it's not directly relevant, but it's a nice statement.
p418
aa(lp419
VThis is by de Saint-Exupery.
p420
aVAnd he says, "You know you've achieved perfection in design,
p421
aVnot when you have nothing more to add,
p422
aVbut when you have nothing more to take away."
p423
aVAnd that certainly is going in the right direction.
p424
aVSo, what I think one can begin to do
p425
aVwith this kind of
p426
aVcut at the word simplicity,
p427
aVwhich doesn't cover Brancusi,
p428
aVit doesn't answer the question of
p429
aVwhy Mondrian is better or worse
p430
aVor simpler or less simpler than Van Gogh,
p431
aVand certainly doesn't address the question
p432
aVof whether Mozart is simpler than Bach.
p433
aa(lp434
VBut it does make a point \u2014
p435
aVwhich is one which, in a sense,
p436
aVdifferentiates the real world of people who make things,
p437
aVand the world of people who think about things,
p438
aVwhich is, there is an intellectual merit
p439
aVto asking: How do we make things
p440
aVas simple as we can,
p441
aVas cheap as we can, as functional as we can
p442
aVand as freely interconnectable as we can?
p443
aVIf we make that kind of simplicity in our technology
p444
aVand then give it to you guys,
p445
aVyou can go off and do all kinds of fabulous things with it.
p446
aa(lp447
VThank you very much.
p448
aa(lp449
V(Applause)
p450
aa(lp451
VChris Anderson: Quick question.
p452
aVSo can you picture
p453
aVthat a science of simplicity
p454
aVmight get to the point where
p455
aVyou could look out at various systems \u2014
p456
aVsay a financial system or a legal system, health system \u2014 and say,
p457
aV"That has got to the point of danger
p458
aVor dysfunctionality for the following reasons,
p459
aVand this is how we might simplify it"?
p460
aa(lp461
VGeorge Whitesides: Yes, I think you could. Because if you look
p462
aVat the components from which the system is made
p463
aVand examine their fragility, or their stability,
p464
aVyou can probably build a kind of risk assessment based on that basis.
p465
aa(lp466
VCA: Have you started to do that?
p467
aVI mean, with the health system, you got a sort of
p468
aVradical solution on the cost side,
p469
aVbut in terms of the system itself?
p470
aa(lp471
VGW: Well, no.
p472
aVHow do I put that simply? No.
p473
aa(lp474
