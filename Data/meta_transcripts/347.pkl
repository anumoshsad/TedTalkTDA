VWhen I knew I was going to come to speak to you, I thought,
p4
aV"I gotta call my mother."
p5
aVI have a little Cuban mother \u2014 she's about that big.
p6
aVFour feet. Nothing larger than the sum of her figurative parts.
p7
aVYou still with me? (Laughter)
p8
aVI called her up.
p9
aV"Hello, how're you doing, baby?"
p10
aV"Hey, ma, I got to talk to you."
p11
aV"You're talking to me already. What's the matter?"
p12
aVI said, "I've got to talk to a bunch of nice people."
p13
aV"You're always talking to nice people, except when you went
p14
aVto the White House."
p15
aV"Ma, don't start!"
p16
aVAnd I told her I was coming to TED, and she said,
p17
aV"What's the problem?"
p18
aVAnd I said, "Well, I'm not sure."
p19
aVI said, "I have to talk to them about stories.
p20
aVIt's 'Technology, Entertainment and Design.'"
p21
aVAnd she said, "Well, you design a story when you make it up,
p22
aVit's entertainment when you tell it,
p23
aVand you're going to use a microphone."
p24
aV(Laughter)
p25
aVI said, "You're a peach, ma. Pop there?"
p26
aV"What's the matter? The pearls of wisdom
p27
aVleaping from my lips like lemmings is no good for you?"
p28
aV(Laughter)
p29
aVThen my pop got on there.
p30
aVMy pop, he's one of the old souls, you know \u2014
p31
aVold Cuban man from Camaguey.
p32
aVCamaguey is a province in Cuba.
p33
aVHe's from Florida.
p34
aVHe was born there in 1924.
p35
aVHe grew up in a bohio of dirt floors,
p36
aVand the structure was the kind used by the Tainos,
p37
aVour old Arawak ancestors.
p38
aVMy father is at once quick-witted, wickedly funny,
p39
aVand then poignancy turns on a dime and leaves you breathless.
p40
aV"Papi, help."
p41
aV"I already heard your mother. I think she's right."
p42
aV(Laughter)
p43
aV"After what I just told you?"
p44
aVMy whole life, my father's been there.
p45
aVSo we talked for a few minutes, and he said,
p46
aV"Why don't you tell them what you believe?"
p47
aVI love that, but we don't have the time.
p48
aVGood storytelling is crafting a story that someone wants to listen to.
p49
aVGreat story is the art of letting go.
p50
aVSo I'm going to tell you a little story.
p51
aVRemember, this tradition comes to us
p52
aVnot from the mists of Avalon, back in time, but further still,
p53
aVbefore we were scratching out these stories on papyrus,
p54
aVor we were doing the pictographs on walls in moist, damp caves.
p55
aVBack then, we had an urge, a need, to tell the story.
p56
aVWhen Lexus wants to sell you a car, they're telling you a story.
p57
aVHave you been watching the commercials?
p58
aVBecause every one of us has this desire, for once \u2014 just once \u2014
p59
aVto tell our story and have it heard.
p60
aVThere are stories you tell from stages.
p61
aVThere's stories that you may tell
p62
aVin a small group of people with some good wine.
p63
aVAnd there's stories you tell late at night to a friend,
p64
aVmaybe once in your life.
p65
aVAnd then there are stories that we whisper into a Stygian darkness.
p66
aVI'm not telling you that story.
p67
aVI'm telling you this one.
p68
aVIt's called, "You're Going to Miss Me."
p69
aVIt's about human connection.
p70
aVMy Cuban mother, which I just briefly introduced you to
p71
aVin that short character sketch,
p72
aVcame to the United States one thousand years ago.
p73
aVI was born in 19 \u2014 I forget, and I came to this country
p74
aVwith them in the aftermath of the Cuban revolution.
p75
aVWe went from Havana, Cuba to Decatur, Georgia.
p76
aVAnd Decatur, Georgia's a small Southern town.
p77
aVAnd in that little Southern town, I grew up,
p78
aVand grew up hearing these stories.
p79
aVBut this story only happened a few years ago.
p80
aVI called my mom.
p81
aVIt was a Saturday morning.
p82
aVAnd I was calling about how to make ajiaco. It's a Cuban meal.
p83
aVIt's delicious. It's savory.
p84
aVIt makes spit froth in the little corners of your mouth \u2014
p85
aVis that enough? It makes your armpits juicy, you know?
p86
aVThat kind of food, yeah.
p87
aVThis is the sensory part of the program, people.
p88
aVI called my mother, and she said, "Carmen, I need you to come, please.
p89
aVI need to go to the mall, and you know your father now,
p90
aVhe takes a nap in the afternoon, and I got to go.
p91
aVI got an errand to run."
p92
aVLet me parenthetically pause here and tell you \u2014
p93
aVEsther, my mother, had stopped driving several years ago,
p94
aVto the collective relief of the entire city of Atlanta.
p95
aVAny vehicular outing with that woman from the time I was a young child,
p96
aVguys, naturally included flashing, blue lights.
p97
aVBut she'd become adept at dodging the boys in blue,
p98
aVand when she did meet them, oh, she had wonderful, well, rapport.
p99
aV"Ma'am, did you know that was a light you just ran?"
p100
aV(Spanish)
p101
aV"You don't speak English?"
p102
aV"No."
p103
aV(Laughter)
p104
aVBut eventually, every dog has its day,
p105
aVand she ended up in traffic court,
p106
aVwhere she bartered with the judge for a discount.
p107
aVThere's a historical marker.
p108
aVBut now she was a septuagenarian, she'd stopped driving.
p109
aVAnd that meant that everyone in the family had to sign up
p110
aVto take her to have her hair dyed, you know,
p111
aVthat peculiar color of blue that matches her polyester pants suit,
p112
aVyou know, same color as the Buick.
p113
aVAnybody? All right.
p114
aVLittle picks on the legs, where she does her needlepoint, and leaves little loops.
p115
aVRockports \u2014 they're for this.
p116
aVThat's why they call them that.
p117
aV(Laughter)
p118
aVThis is her ensemble.
p119
aVAnd this is the woman that wants me to come on a Saturday morning
p120
aVwhen I have a lot to do, but it doesn't take long because Cuban guilt is a weighty thing.
p121
aVI'm not going political on you but ... And so, I go to my mother's.
p122
aVI show up. She's in the carport.
p123
aVOf course, they have a carport.
p124
aVThe kind with the corrugated roof, you know.
p125
aVThe Buick's parked outside,
p126
aVand she's jingling, jangling a pair of keys.
p127
aV"I got a surprise for you, baby!"
p128
aV"We taking your car?"
p129
aV"Not we, I."
p130
aVAnd she reaches into her pocket and pulls out a catastrophe.
p131
aVSomebody's storytelling. Interactive art. You can talk to me.
p132
aVOh, a driver's license, a perfectly valid driver's license.
p133
aVIssued, evidently, by the DMV in her own county of Gwinnett.
p134
aVBlithering fucking idiots.
p135
aV(Laughter)
p136
aVI said, "Is that thing real?"
p137
aV"I think so."
p138
aV"Can you even see?"
p139
aV"I guess I must."
p140
aV"Oh, Jesus."
p141
aVShe gets into the car \u2014 she's sitting on two phone books.
p142
aVI can't even make this part up because she's that tiny.
p143
aVShe's engineered an umbrella so she can \u2014 bam! \u2014 slam the door.
p144
aVHer daughter, me, the village idiot with the ice cream cone
p145
aVin the middle of her forehead, is still standing there, slack-jawed.
p146
aV"You coming? You no coming?"
p147
aV"Oh, my God." I said, "OK, fine. Does pop know you're driving?"
p148
aV"Are you kidding me?"
p149
aV"How are you doing it?"
p150
aV"He's got to sleep sometime."
p151
aVAnd so we left my father fast asleep, because I knew he'd kill me
p152
aVif I let her go by herself, and we get in the car.
p153
aVPuts it in reverse. Fifty-five out of the driveway, in reverse.
p154
aVI am buckling in seatbelts from the front.
p155
aVI'm yanking them in from the back. I'm doing double knots.
p156
aVI mean, I've got a mouth as dry as the Kalahari Desert.
p157
aVI've got a white-knuckle grip on the door. You know what I'm talking about?
p158
aVAnd she's whistling, and finally I do the kind of
p159
aVbirth breathing \u2014 you know, that one?
p160
aVOnly a couple of women are going uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. Right.
p161
aVAnd I said, "Ma, would you slow down?"
p162
aVBecause now she's picked up the Highway 285,
p163
aVthe perimeter around Atlanta, which encompasses now \u2014
p164
aVthere's seven lanes, she's on all of them, y'all.
p165
aVI said, "Ma, pick a lane!"
p166
aV"They give you seven lanes, they expect you to use them."
p167
aVAnd there she goes, right.
p168
aVI don't believe for a minute she has been out and not been stopped.
p169
aVSo, I think, hey, we can talk. It'll be a diversion.
p170
aVIt'll help my breathing. It'll do something for my pulse, maybe.
p171
aV"Mommy, I know you have been stopped."
p172
aV"No, no, what you talking about?"
p173
aV"You have a license. How long have you been driving?"
p174
aV"Four or five days."
p175
aV"Yeah. And you haven't been stopped?"
p176
aV"I did not get a ticket."
p177
aVI said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, but come on, come on, come on."
p178
aV"OK, so I stopped at a light
p179
aVand there's a guy, you know, in the back."
p180
aV"Would this guy have, like, a blue uniform
p181
aVand a terrified look on his face?"
p182
aV"You weren't there, don't start."
p183
aV"Come on. You got a ticket?"
p184
aV"No." She explained,
p185
aV"The man" \u2014 I have to tell you as she did,
p186
aVbecause it loses something if I don't, you know \u2014
p187
aV"he come to the window, and he does a thing like this,
p188
aVwhich tells me he's pretty old, you know.
p189
aVSo I look up and I'm thinking,
p190
aVmaybe he's still going to think I'm kind of cute."
p191
aV"Ma, are you still doing that?"
p192
aV"If it works, it works, baby.
p193
aVSo, I say, 'Perdon, yo no hablo ingles.'
p194
aVWell, wouldn't you know, he had been in Honduras for the Peace Corps."
p195
aV(Laughter)
p196
aVSo he's talking to her, and at some point she says,
p197
aV"Then, you know, it was it. That was it. It was done."
p198
aV"Yeah? What?
p199
aVHe gave you a ticket? He didn't give you a ticket? What?"
p200
aV"No, I look up, and the light, she change."
p201
aV(Laughter)
p202
aVYou should be terrified.
p203
aVNow, I don't know if she's toying with me,
p204
aVkind of like a cat batting back a mouse, batting back a mouse \u2014
p205
aVleft paw, right paw, left paw, right paw \u2014
p206
aVbut by now, we've reached the mall.
p207
aVNow, you have all been at a mall during the holidays, yes?
p208
aVTalk to me. Yes. Yes. You can say yes.
p209
aVAudience: Yes.
p210
aVCarmen Agra Deedy: All right, then you know that you have now entered parking lot purgatory,
p211
aVpraying to that saint of perpetual availability
p212
aVthat as you join that serpentine line of cars crawling along,
p213
aVsome guy's going to turn on the brake lights
p214
aVjust as you pull up behind him.
p215
aVBut that doesn't happen most of the time, right?
p216
aVSo, first I say, "Ma, why are we here?"
p217
aV"You mean, like, in the car?"
p218
aV"No, don't \u2014 why are we here today?
p219
aVIt's Saturday. It's the holidays."
p220
aV"Because I have to exchange your father's underwear."
p221
aVNow, see, this is the kind of Machiavellian thinking,
p222
aVthat you really have to \u2014 you know, in my mind, it's a rabbit's warren,
p223
aVthis woman's mind.
p224
aVDo I want to walk in, because unless I have Ariadne's thread to anchor \u2014
p225
aVenough metaphors for you? \u2014 somewhere, I may not get out.
p226
aVBut you know.
p227
aV(Laughter)
p228
aV"Why do we have to take pop's underwear back now?
p229
aVAnd why? What is wrong with his underwear?"
p230
aV"It will upset you."
p231
aV"It won't upset me. Why? What? Is something wrong with him?"
p232
aV"No, no, no. The only thing with him is, he's an idiot.
p233
aVI sent him to the store, which was my first mistake,
p234
aVand he went to buy underwear, and he bought the grippers,
p235
aVand he's supposed to buy the boxers."
p236
aV"Why?"
p237
aV"I read it on the Intersnet. You cannot have children."
p238
aV"Oh, my God!"
p239
aV(Laughter)
p240
aVOlivia? Huh? Huh?
p241
aVBy now, we have now crawled another four feet,
p242
aVand my mother finally says to me, "I knew it, I knew it.
p243
aVI'm an immigrant. We make a space. What I tell you? Right there."
p244
aVAnd she points out the passenger window, and I look out,
p245
aVand three \u2014 three \u2014 aisles down,
p246
aV"Look, the Chevy."
p247
aVYou want to laugh, but you don't know \u2014
p248
aVyou're that politically corrected, have you noticed?
p249
aVCorrect the other direction now, it's OK.
p250
aV"Look, the Chevy \u2014 he's coming this way."
p251
aV"Mama, mama, mama, wait, wait, wait. The Chevy is three aisles away."
p252
aVShe looks at me like I'm her, you know, her moron child,
p253
aVthe cretin, the one she's got to speak to very slowly and distinctly.
p254
aV"I know that, honey. Get out of the car
p255
aVand go stand in the parking space till I get there."
p256
aVOK, I want a vote. Come on, come on. No, no.
p257
aVHow many of you once in your \u2014 you were a kid, you were an adult \u2014
p258
aVyou stood in a parking space to hold it for someone?
p259
aVSee, we're a secret club with a secret handshake.
p260
aV(Laughter)
p261
aVAnd years of therapy later, we're doing great.
p262
aVWe're doing great. We're doing fine.
p263
aVWell, I stood up to her.
p264
aVThis is \u2014 you know, you'd think by now I'm \u2014 and still holding?
p265
aVI said, "No way, ma, you have embarrassed me my entire life."
p266
aVOf course, her comeback is, "When have I embarrassed you?"
p267
aV(Spanish)
p268
aVAnd she's still talking while she puts the car in park,
p269
aVhits the emergency brake, opens the door,
p270
aVand with a spryness astounding in a woman her age,
p271
aVshe jumps out of the car, knocks out the phone books,
p272
aVand then she walks around \u2014
p273
aVshe's carrying her cheap Kmart purse with her \u2014
p274
aVaround the front of the car.
p275
aVShe has amazing land speed for a woman her age, too.
p276
aVBefore I know it, she has skiddled across the parking lot
p277
aVand in between the cars, and people behind me, with that kind of
p278
aVusual religious charity that the holidays bring us, wah-wah wah-wah.
p279
aV"I'm coming." Italian hand signals follow.
p280
aVI scoot over. I close the door. I leave the phone books.
p281
aVThis is new and fast, just so you \u2014 are you still with us?
p282
aVWe'll wait for the slow ones. OK.
p283
aVI start, and this is where a child says to me \u2014
p284
aVand the story doesn't work if I tell you about her before,
p285
aVbecause this is my laconic child.
p286
aVA brevity, brevity of everything with this child.
p287
aVYou know, she eats small portions.
p288
aVLanguage is something to be meted out
p289
aVin small phonemes, you know \u2014 just little hmm, hmm-hmm.
p290
aVShe carries a mean spiral notebook and a pen.
p291
aVShe wields great power.
p292
aVShe listens, because that's what people who tell stories do first.
p293
aVBut she pauses occasionally and says,
p294
aV"How do you spell that? What year? OK."
p295
aVWhen she writes the expose in about 20 years,
p296
aVdon't believe a word of it.
p297
aVBut this is my daughter, Lauren, my remarkable daughter,
p298
aVmy borderline Asperger's kid.
p299
aVBless you, Dr. Watson.
p300
aVShe says, "Ma, you got to look!"
p301
aVNow, when this kid says I got to look, you know.
p302
aVBut it isn't like I haven't seen this crime scene before.
p303
aVI grew up with this woman.
p304
aVI said, "Lauren, you know what, give me a play-by-play. I can't."
p305
aV"No, mama, you got to look."
p306
aVI got to look. You got to look.
p307
aVDon't you want to look?
p308
aVThere she is.
p309
aVI look in bewildered awe:
p310
aVshe's standing, those Rockports slightly apart, but grounded.
p311
aVShe's holding out that cheap Kmart purse, and she is wielding it.
p312
aVShe's holding back tons of steel with the sheer force
p313
aVof her little personality, in that crone-ish voice, saying things like,
p314
aV"Back it up, buddy! No, it's reserved!"
p315
aV(Laughter)
p316
aVReady? Brace yourselves. Here it comes.
p317
aV"No, my daughter, she's coming in the Buick.
p318
aVHoney, sit up so they can see you."
p319
aVOh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus.
p320
aVI finally come \u2014 and now, it's the South.
p321
aVI don't know what part of the country you live in.
p322
aVI think we all secretly love stories.
p323
aVWe all secretly want our blankie and our Boo Bear.
p324
aVWe want to curl up and say, "Tell it to me, tell it to me.
p325
aVCome on, honey, tell it to me."
p326
aVBut in the South, we love a good story.
p327
aVPeople have pulled aside,
p328
aVI mean, they've come out of that queue line,
p329
aVthey have popped their trunks, pulled out lawn chairs and cool drinks.
p330
aVBets are placed.
p331
aV"I'm with the little lady. Damn!"
p332
aV(Laughter)
p333
aVAnd she's bringing me in with a slight salsa movement.
p334
aVShe is, after all, Cuban.
p335
aVI'm thinking, "Accelerator, break. Accelerator, break."
p336
aVLike you've never thought that in your life? Right? Yeah.
p337
aVI pull in. I put the car in park.
p338
aVEngine's still running \u2014 mine, not the car.
p339
aVI jump out next to her going, "Don't you move!"
p340
aV"I'm not going anywhere."
p341
aVShe's got front seat in a Greek tragedy.
p342
aVI come out, and there's Esther.
p343
aVShe's hugging the purse.
p344
aV"Que?" Which means "what," and so much more.
p345
aV(Laughter)
p346
aV"Ma, have you no shame?
p347
aVPeople are watching us all around," right?
p348
aVNow, some of them you've got to make up, people.
p349
aVSecret of the trade.
p350
aVGuess what? Some of these stories I sculpt a little, here and there.
p351
aVSome, they're just right there, right there. Put them right there.
p352
aVShe says this to me.
p353
aVAfter I say \u2014 let me refresh you \u2014
p354
aV"have you no shame?"
p355
aV"No. I gave it up with pantyhose \u2014 they're both too binding."
p356
aV(Laughter)
p357
aV(Applause)
p358
aVYeah, you can clap, but then you're about 30 seconds from the end.
p359
aVI'm about to snap like a brittle twig, when suddenly someone taps me on the shoulder.
p360
aVIntrepid soul.
p361
aVI'm thinking, "This is my kid. How dare she?
p362
aVShe jumped out of that car."
p363
aVThat's OK, because my mother yells at me, I yell at her.
p364
aVIt's a beautiful hierarchy, and it works.
p365
aV(Laughter)
p366
aVI turn around, but it's not a child. It's a young woman,
p367
aVa little taller than I, pale green, amused eyes.
p368
aVWith her is a young man \u2014 husband, brother, lover, it's not my job.
p369
aVAnd she says, "Pardon me, ma'am" \u2014 that's how we talk down there \u2014
p370
aV"is that your mother?"
p371
aVI said, "No, I follow little old women around parking lots
p372
aVto see if they'll stop. Yes, it's my mother!"
p373
aVThe boy, now, he says. "Well, what my sister meant" \u2014
p374
aVthey look at each other, it's a knowing glance \u2014 "God, she's crazy!"
p375
aVI said, (Spanish), and the young girl and the young boy say,
p376
aV"No, no, honey, we just want to know one more thing."
p377
aVI said, "Look, please, let me take care of her, OK,
p378
aVbecause I know her, and believe me, she's like a small atomic weapon,
p379
