VI've always written primarily about architecture,
p4
aVabout buildings, and writing about architecture
p5
aVis based on certain assumptions.
p6
aVAn architect designs a building, and it becomes a place,
p7
aVor many architects design many buildings, and it becomes
p8
aVa city, and regardless of this complicated mix of forces
p9
aVof politics and culture and economics that shapes
p10
aVthese places, at the end of the day, you can go
p11
aVand you can visit them. You can walk around them.
p12
aVYou can smell them. You can get a feel for them.
p13
aVYou can experience their sense of place.
p14
aa(lp15
VBut what was striking to me over the last several years
p16
aVwas that less and less was I going out into the world,
p17
aVand more and more, I was sitting in front of my computer screen.
p18
aVAnd especially since about 2007, when I got an iPhone,
p19
aVI was not only sitting in front of my screen all day,
p20
aVbut I was also getting up at the end of the day
p21
aVand looking at this little screen that I carried in my pocket.
p22
aVAnd what was surprising to me was how quickly
p23
aVmy relationship to the physical world had changed.
p24
aVIn this very short period of time, you know, whether you
p25
aVcall it the last 15 years or so of being online, or the last,
p26
aVyou know, four or five years of being online all the time,
p27
aVour relationship to our surroundings had changed in that
p28
aVour attention is constantly divided. You know,
p29
aVwe're both looking inside the screens and we're looking
p30
aVout in the world around us.
p31
aa(lp32
VAnd what was even more striking to me, and what I really
p33
aVgot hung up on, was that the world inside the screen
p34
aVseemed to have no physical reality of its own.
p35
aVIf you went and looked for images of the Internet,
p36
aVthis was all that you found, this famous image by Opte
p37
aVof the Internet as the kind of Milky Way, this infinite expanse
p38
aVwhere we don't seem to be anywhere on it.
p39
aVWe can never seem to grasp it in its totality.
p40
aVIt's always reminded me of the Apollo image of the Earth,
p41
aVthe blue marble picture, and it's similarly meant to suggest,
p42
aVI think, that we can't really understand it as a whole.
p43
aVWe're always sort of small in the face of its expanse.
p44
aa(lp45
VSo if there was this world and this screen, and if there was
p46
aVthe physical world around me, I couldn't ever get them
p47
aVtogether in the same place.
p48
aa(lp49
VAnd then this happened.
p50
aVMy Internet broke one day, as it occasionally does,
p51
aVand the cable guy came to fix it, and he started with
p52
aVthe dusty clump of cables behind the couch,
p53
aVand he followed it to the front of my building and into the basement and out to the back yard,
p54
aVand there was this big jumble of cables against the wall.
p55
aVAnd then he saw a squirrel running along the wire,
p56
aVand he said, "There's your problem.
p57
aVA squirrel is chewing on your Internet." (Laughter)
p58
aVAnd this seemed astounding. The Internet is
p59
aVa transcendent idea. It's a set of protocols that has changed
p60
aVeverything from shopping to dating to revolutions.
p61
aVIt was unequivocally not something
p62
aVa squirrel could chew on. (Laughter)
p63
aVBut that in fact seemed to be the case.
p64
aVA squirrel had in fact chewed on my Internet. (Laughter)
p65
aVAnd then I got this image in my head of what would happen
p66
aVif you yanked the wire from the wall and if you started
p67
aVto follow it. Where would it go?
p68
aVWas the Internet actually a place that you could visit?
p69
aVCould I go there? Who would I meet?
p70
aVYou know, was there something actually out there?
p71
aa(lp72
VAnd the answer, by all accounts, was no.
p73
aVThis was the Internet, this black box with a red light on it,
p74
aVas represented in the sitcom "The IT Crowd."
p75
aVNormally it lives on the top of Big Ben,
p76
aVbecause that's where you get the best reception,
p77
aVbut they had negotiated that their colleague could borrow it
p78
aVfor the afternoon to use in an office presentation.
p79
aVThe elders of the Internet were willing to part with it
p80
aVfor a short while, and she looks at it and she says,
p81
aV"This is the Internet? The whole Internet? Is it heavy?"
p82
aVThey say, "Of course not, the Internet doesn't weigh anything."
p83
aa(lp84
VAnd I was embarrassed. I was looking for this thing
p85
aVthat only fools seem to look for.
p86
aVThe Internet was that amorphous blob, or it was a silly
p87
aVblack box with a blinking red light on it.
p88
aVIt wasn't a real world out there.
p89
aa(lp90
VBut, in fact, it is. There is a real world of the Internet out there,
p91
aVand that's what I spent about two years visiting,
p92
aVthese places of the Internet. I was in large data centers
p93
aVthat use as much power as the cities in which they sit,
p94
aVand I visited places like this, 60 Hudson Street in New York,
p95
aVwhich is one of the buildings in the world,
p96
aVone of a very short list of buildings, about a dozen buildings,
p97
aVwhere more networks of the Internet connect to each other
p98
aVthan anywhere else.
p99
aVAnd that connection is an unequivocally physical process.
p100
aVIt's about the router of one network, a Facebook or
p101
aVa Google or a B.T. or a Comcast or a Time Warner, whatever it is,
p102
aVconnecting with usually a yellow fiber optic cable up into
p103
aVthe ceiling and down into the router of another network,
p104
aVand that's unequivocally physical, and it's surprisingly intimate.
p105
aVA building like 60 Hudson, and a dozen or so others,
p106
aVhas 10 times more networks connecting within it
p107
aVthan the next tier of buildings.
p108
aVThere's a very short list of these places.
p109
aVAnd 60 Hudson in particular is interesting because it's home
p110
aVto about a half a dozen very important networks,
p111
aVwhich are the networks which serve the undersea cables
p112
aVthat travel underneath the ocean
p113
aVthat connect Europe and America and connect all of us.
p114
aVAnd it's those cables in particular that I want to focus on.
p115
aa(lp116
VIf the Internet is a global phenomenon, if we live
p117
aVin a global village, it's because there are cables underneath
p118
aVthe ocean, cables like this.
p119
aVAnd in this dimension, they are incredibly small.
p120
aVYou can you hold them in your hand. They're like a garden hose.
p121
aVBut in the other dimension they are incredibly expansive,
p122
aVas expansive as you can imagine.
p123
aVThey stretch across the ocean. They're three or five
p124
aVor eight thousand miles in length, and
p125
aVif the material science and the computational technology
p126
aVis incredibly complicated, the basic physical process
p127
aVis shockingly simple. Light goes in on one end of the ocean
p128
aVand comes out on the other, and it usually comes
p129
aVfrom a building called a landing station that's often
p130
aVtucked away inconspicuously in a little seaside neighborhood,
p131
aVand there are amplifiers that sit on the ocean floor
p132
aVthat look kind of like bluefin tuna, and every 50 miles
p133
aVthey amplify the signal, and since the rate of transmission
p134
aVis incredibly fast, the basic unit is a 10-gigabit-per-second
p135
aVwavelength of light, maybe a thousand times your own
p136
aVconnection, or capable of carrying 10,000 video streams,
p137
aVbut not only that, but you'll put not just one wavelength of light
p138
aVthrough one of the fibers, but you'll put maybe
p139
aV50 or 60 or 70 different wavelengths or colors of light
p140
aVthrough a single fiber, and then you'll have maybe
p141
aVeight fibers in a cable, four going in each direction.
p142
aVAnd they're tiny. They're the thickness of a hair.
p143
aa(lp144
VAnd then they connect to the continent somewhere.
p145
aVThey connect in a manhole like this. Literally,
p146
aVthis is where the 5,000-mile cable plugs in.
p147
aVThis is in Halifax, a cable that stretches from Halifax to Ireland.
p148
aVAnd the landscape is changing. Three years ago,
p149
aVwhen I started thinking about this, there was one cable
p150
aVdown the Western coast of Africa, represented
p151
aVin this map by Steve Song as that thin black line.
p152
aVNow there are six cables and more coming, three down each coast.
p153
aVBecause once a country gets plugged in by one cable,
p154
aVthey realize that it's not enough. If they're going to build
p155
aVan industry around it, they need to know that their connection
p156
aVisn't tenuous but permanent, because if a cable breaks,
p157
aVyou have to send a ship out into the water, throw
p158
aVa grappling hook over the side, pick it up, find the other end,
p159
aVand then fuse the two ends back together and then dump it over.
p160
aVIt's an intensely, intensely physical process.
p161
aa(lp162
VSo this is my friend Simon Cooper, who until very recently
p163
aVworked for Tata Communications, the communications wing
p164
aVof Tata, the big Indian industrial conglomerate.
p165
aVAnd I've never met him. We've only communicated
p166
aVvia this telepresence system, which always makes me
p167
aVthink of him as the man inside the Internet. (Laughter)
p168
aVAnd he is English. The undersea cable industry
p169
aVis dominated by Englishmen, and they all seem to be 42.
p170
aV(Laughter) Because they all started at the same time
p171
aVwith the boom about 20 years ago.
p172
aVAnd Tata had gotten its start as a communications business
p173
aVwhen they bought two cables, one across the Atlantic
p174
aVand one across the Pacific, and proceeded to add pieces
p175
aVonto them, until they had built a belt around the world,
p176
aVwhich means they will send your bits to the East or the West.
p177
aVThey have \u2014 this is literally a beam of light around the world,
p178
aVand if a cable breaks in the Pacific, it'll send it around
p179
aVthe other direction. And then having done that,
p180
aVthey started to look for places to wire next.
p181
aVThey looked for the unwired places, and that's meant
p182
aVNorth and South, primarily these cables to Africa.
p183
aVBut what amazes me is Simon's incredible geographic imagination.
p184
aVHe thinks about the world with this incredible expansiveness.
p185
aa(lp186
VAnd I was particularly interested because I wanted to see
p187
aVone of these cables being built. See, you know, all the time
p188
aVonline we experience these fleeting moments of connection,
p189
aVthese sort of brief adjacencies, a tweet or a Facebook post
p190
aVor an email, and it seemed like there was a physical corollary to that.
p191
aVIt seemed like there was a moment when the continent
p192
aVwas being plugged in, and I wanted to see that.
p193
aVAnd Simon was working on a new cable,
p194
aVWACS, the West Africa Cable System, that stretched
p195
aVfrom Lisbon down the west coast of Africa,
p196
aVto Cote d'Ivoire, to Ghana, to Nigeria, to Cameroon.
p197
aVAnd he said there was coming soon, depending
p198
aVon the weather, but he'd let me know when,
p199
aVand so with about four days notice, he said to go
p200
aVto this beach south of Lisbon, and a little after 9,
p201
aVthis guy will walk out of the water. (Laughter)
p202
aVAnd he'll be carrying a green nylon line, a lightweight line,
p203
aVcalled a messenger line, and that was the first link
p204
aVbetween sea and land, this link that would then be
p205
aVleveraged into this 9,000-mile path of light.
p206
aVThen a bulldozer began to pull the cable in from this
p207
aVspecialized cable landing ship, and it was floated
p208
aVon these buoys until it was in the right place.
p209
aVThen you can see the English engineers looking on.
p210
aVAnd then, once it was in the right place, he got back
p211
aVin the water holding a big knife, and he cut each buoy off,
p212
aVand the buoy popped up into the air, and the cable
p213
aVdropped to the sea floor, and he did that all the way out
p214
aVto the ship, and when he got there,
p215
aVthey gave him a glass of juice and a cookie,
p216
aVand then he jumped back in, and he swam back to shore,
p217
aVand then he lit a cigarette. (Laughter)
p218
aa(lp219
VAnd then once that cable was on shore,
p220
aVthey began to prepare to connect it to the other side,
p221
aVfor the cable that had been brought down from the landing station.
p222
aVAnd first they got it with a hacksaw, and then they start
p223
aVsort of shaving away at this plastic interior with a \u2014
p224
aVsort of working like chefs, and then finally they're working
p225
aVlike jewelers to get these hair-thin fibers to line up
p226
aVwith the cable that had come down,
p227
aVand with this hole-punch machine they fuse it together.
p228
aVAnd when you see these guys going at this cable with a hacksaw,
p229
aVyou stop thinking about the Internet as a cloud.
p230
aVIt starts to seem like an incredibly physical thing.
p231
aVAnd what surprised me as well was that as much as this
p232
aVis based on the most sophisticated technology, as much
p233
aVas this is an incredibly new thing, the physical process
p234
aVitself has been around for a long time, and the culture is the same.
p235
aVYou see the local laborers. You see the English engineer
p236
aVgiving directions in the background. And more importantly,
p237
aVthe places are the same. These cables still connect
p238
aVthese classic port cities, places like Lisbon, Mombasa,
p239
aVMumbai, Singapore, New York.
p240
aa(lp241
VAnd then the process on shore takes around three or four days,
p242
aVand then, when it's done, they put the manhole cover
p243
aVback on top, and they push the sand over that,
p244
aVand we all forget about it.
p245
aa(lp246
VAnd it seems to me that we talk a lot about the cloud,
p247
aVbut every time we put something on the cloud,
p248
aVwe give up some responsibility for it.
p249
aVWe are less connected to it. We let other people worry about it.
p250
aVAnd that doesn't seem right.
p251
aVThere's a great Neal Stephenson line where he says
p252
aVthat wired people should know something about wires.
p253
aVAnd we should know, I think, we should know
p254
aVwhere our Internet comes from, and we should know
p255
aVwhat it is that physically, physically connects us all.
p256
aVThank you. (Applause)
