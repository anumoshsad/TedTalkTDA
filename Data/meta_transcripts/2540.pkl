VImagine you are a part of a crew of astronauts
p4
aVtraveling to Mars or some distant planet.
p5
aVThe travel time could take a year
p6
aVor even longer.
p7
aVThe space on board and the resources
p8
aVwould be limited.
p9
aVSo you and the crew would have to figure out how to produce food
p10
aVwith minimal inputs.
p11
aVWhat if you could bring with you just a few packets of seeds,
p12
aVand grow crops in a matter of hours?
p13
aVAnd what if those crops would then make more seeds,
p14
aVenabling you to feed the entire crew
p15
aVwith just those few packets of seeds for the duration of the trip?
p16
aa(lp17
VWell, the scientists at NASA actually figured out a way to do this.
p18
aVWhat they came up with was actually quite interesting.
p19
aVIt involved microorganisms,
p20
aVwhich are single-celled organisms.
p21
aVAnd they also used hydrogen from water.
p22
aVThe types of microbes that they used were called hydrogenotrophs,
p23
aVand with these hydrogenotrophs, you can create a virtuous carbon cycle
p24
aVthat would sustain life onboard a spacecraft.
p25
aVAstronauts would breathe out carbon dioxide,
p26
aVthat carbon dioxide would then be captured by the microbes
p27
aVand converted into a nutritious, carbon-rich crop.
p28
aVThe astronauts would then eat that carbon-rich crop
p29
aVand exhale the carbon out in the form of carbon dioxide,
p30
aVwhich would then be captured by the microbes,
p31
aVto create a nutritious crop,
p32
aVwhich then would be exhaled in the form of carbon dioxide
p33
aVby the astronauts.
p34
aVSo in this way, a closed-loop carbon cycle is created.
p35
aa(lp36
VSo why is this important?
p37
aVWe need carbon to survive as humans,
p38
aVand we get our carbon from food.
p39
aVOn a long space journey,
p40
aVyou simply wouldn't be able to pick up any carbon along the way,
p41
aVso you'd have to figure out how to recycle it on board.
p42
aa(lp43
VThis is a clever solution, right?
p44
aVBut the thing is, that research didn't really go anywhere.
p45
aVWe haven't yet gone to Mars. We haven't yet gone to another planet.
p46
aVAnd this was actually done in the '60s and '70s.
p47
aVSo a colleague of mine, Dr. John Reed, and I,
p48
aVwere interested, actually, in carbon recycling here on Earth.
p49
aVWe wanted to come up with technical solutions
p50
aVto address climate change.
p51
aVAnd we discovered this research
p52
aVby reading some papers published in the '60s \u2014 1967 and later \u2014
p53
aVarticles about this work.
p54
aVAnd we thought it was a really good idea.
p55
aVSo we said, well, Earth is actually like a spaceship.
p56
aVWe have limited space and limited resources,
p57
aVand on Earth, we really do need to figure out
p58
aVhow to recycle our carbon better.
p59
aa(lp60
VSo we had the idea,
p61
aVcan we take some of these NASA-type ideas and apply them
p62
aVto our carbon problem here on Earth?
p63
aVCould we cultivate these NASA-type microbes
p64
aVin order to make valuable products here on Earth?
p65
aVWe started a company to do it.
p66
aVAnd in that company, we discovered that these hydrogenotrophs \u2014
p67
aVwhich I'll actually call nature's supercharged carbon recyclers \u2014
p68
aVwe found that they are a powerful class of microbes
p69
aVthat had been largely overlooked and understudied,
p70
aVand that they could make some really valuable products.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo we began cultivating these products, these microbes, in our lab.
p73
aVWe found that we can make essential amino acids from carbon dioxide
p74
aVusing these microbes.
p75
aVAnd we even made a protein-rich meal
p76
aVthat has an amino acid profile similar to what you might find
p77
aVin some animal proteins.
p78
aVWe began cultivating them even further,
p79
aVand we found that we can make oil.
p80
aVOils are used to manufacture many products.
p81
aVWe made an oil that was similar to a citrus oil,
p82
aVwhich can be used for flavoring and for fragrances,
p83
aVbut it also can be used as a biodegradable cleaner
p84
aVor even as a jet fuel.
p85
aVAnd we made an oil that's similar to palm oil.
p86
aVPalm oil is used to manufacture
p87
aVa wide range of consumer and industrial goods.
p88
aa(lp89
VWe began working with manufacturers to scale up this technology,
p90
aVand we're currently working with them
p91
aVto bring some of these products to market.
p92
aVWe believe this type of technology can indeed help us
p93
aVprofitably recycle carbon dioxide into valuable products \u2014
p94
aVsomething that's beneficial for the planet
p95
aVbut also beneficial for business.
p96
aVThat's what we're doing today.
p97
aVBut tomorrow, this type of technology and using these types of microbes
p98
aVactually could help us do something even greater
p99
aVif we take it to the next level.
p100
aVWe believe that this type of technology
p101
aVcan actually help us address an issue with agriculture
p102
aVand allow us to create a type of agriculture that's sustainable,
p103
aVthat will allow us to scale to meet the demands of tomorrow.
p104
aa(lp105
VAnd why might we need a sustainable agriculture?
p106
aVWell, actually, it is estimated
p107
aVthat the population will reach about 10 billion by 2050,
p108
aVand we're projecting that we will need to increase food production
p109
aVby 70 percent.
p110
aVIn addition, we will need many more resources and raw materials
p111
aVto make consumer goods and industrial goods.
p112
aVSo how will we scale to meet that demand?
p113
aa(lp114
VWell, modern agriculture simply cannot sustainably scale to meet that demand.
p115
aVThere are a number of reasons why.
p116
aVOne of them is that modern agriculture is one of the largest emitters
p117
aVof greenhouse gases.
p118
aVIn fact, it emits more greenhouse gases
p119
aVthan our cars, our trucks, our planes
p120
aVand our trains combined.
p121
aVAnother reason is that modern ag simply takes up a whole lot of land.
p122
aVWe have cleared 19.4 million square miles for crops and livestock.
p123
aVWhat does that look like?
p124
aVWell, that's roughly the size of South America and Africa combined.
p125
aa(lp126
VLet me give you a specific example.
p127
aVIn Indonesia, an amount of virgin rainforest was cleared
p128
aVtotaling the size of approximately Ireland,
p129
aVbetween 2000 and 2012.
p130
aVJust think of all of the species, the diversity,
p131
aVthat was removed in the process,
p132
aVwhether plant life, insects or animal life.
p133
aVAnd a natural carbon sink was also removed.
p134
aa(lp135
VSo let me make this real for you.
p136
aVThis clearing happened primarily to make room for palm plantations.
p137
aVAnd as I mentioned before,
p138
aVpalm oil is used to manufacture many products.
p139
aVIn fact, it is estimated that over 50 percent of consumer products
p140
aVare manufactured using palm oil.
p141
aVAnd that includes things like ice cream, cookies ...
p142
aVIt includes cooking oils.
p143
aVIt also includes detergents, lotions, soaps.
p144
aVYou and I both probably have numerous items
p145
aVin our kitchens and our bathrooms
p146
aVthat were manufactured using palm oil.
p147
aVSo you and I are direct beneficiaries of removed rainforests.
p148
aa(lp149
VModern ag has some problems,
p150
aVand we need solutions if we want to scale sustainably.
p151
aVI believe that microbes can be a part of the answer \u2014
p152
aVspecifically, these supercharged carbon recyclers.
p153
aVThese supercharged carbon recyclers,
p154
aVlike plants, serve as the natural recyclers
p155
aVin their ecosystems where they thrive.
p156
aVAnd they thrive in exotic places on Earth,
p157
aVlike hydrothermal vents and hot springs.
p158
aVIn those ecosystems, they take carbon and recycle it
p159
aVinto the nutrients needed for those ecosystems.
p160
aVAnd they're rich in nutrients,
p161
aVsuch as oils and proteins, minerals and carbohydrates.
p162
aa(lp163
VAnd actually, microbes are already an integral part of our everyday lives.
p164
aVIf you enjoy a glass of pinot noir on a Friday night,
p165
aVafter a long, hard work week,
p166
aVthen you are enjoying a product of microbes.
p167
aVIf you enjoy a beer from your local microbrewery \u2014
p168
aVa product of microbes.
p169
aVOr bread, or cheese, or yogurt.
p170
aVThese are all products of microbes.
p171
aVBut the beauty and power associated with these supercharged carbon recyclers
p172
aVlies in the fact that they can actually produce in a matter of hours
p173
aVversus months.
p174
aVThat means we can make crops
p175
aVmuch faster than we're making them today.
p176
aVThey grow in the dark,
p177
aVso they can grow in any season
p178
aVand in any geography and any location.
p179
aVThey can grow in containers that require minimal space.
p180
aVAnd we can get to a type of vertical agriculture.
p181
aVInstead of our traditional horizontal agriculture
p182
aVthat requires so much land,
p183
aVwe can scale vertically,
p184
aVand as a result produce much more product per area.
p185
aa(lp186
VIf we implement this type of approach and use these carbon recyclers,
p187
aVthen we wouldn't have to remove any more rainforests
p188
aVto make the food and the goods that we consume.
p189
aVBecause, at a large scale,
p190
aVyou can actually make 10,000 times more output per land area
p191
aVthan you could \u2014 for instance, if you used soybeans \u2014
p192
aVif you planted soybeans on that same area of land
p193
aVover a period of a year.
p194
aVTen thousand times over a period of a year.
p195
aVSo this is what I mean by a new type of agriculture.
p196
aVAnd this is what I mean by developing a system
p197
aVthat allows us to sustainably scale to meet the demands of 10 billion.
p198
aa(lp199
VAnd what would be the products of this new type of agriculture?
p200
aVWell, we've already made a protein meal,
p201
aVso you can imagine something similar to a soybean meal,
p202
aVor even cornmeal, or wheat flour.
p203
aVWe've already made oils,
p204
aVso you can imagine something similar to coconut oil
p205
aVor olive oil or soybean oil.
p206
aVSo this type of crop can actually produce the nutrients
p207
aVthat would give us pasta and bread,
p208
aVcakes, nutritional items of many sorts.
p209
aVFurthermore, since oil is used to manufacture multiple other goods,
p210
aVindustrial products and consumer products,
p211
aVyou can imagine being able to make detergents, soaps, lotions, etc.,
p212
aVusing these types of crops.
p213
aa(lp214
VNot only are we running out of space,
p215
aVbut if we continue to operate under the status quo
p216
aVwith modern agriculture,
p217
aVwe run the risk of robbing our progeny of a beautiful planet.
p218
aVBut it doesn't have to be this way.
p219
aVWe can imagine a future of abundance.
p220
aVLet us create systems that keep planet Earth, our spaceship,
p221
aVnot only from not crashing,
p222
aVbut let us also develop systems and ways of living
p223
aVthat will be beneficial to the lives of ourselves
p224
aVand the 10 billion that will be on this planet by 2050.
