VThis story begins in 1985,
p4
aVwhen at age 22,
p5
aVI became the World Chess Champion
p6
aVafter beating Anatoly Karpov.
p7
aVEarlier that year,
p8
aVI played what is called simultaneous exhibition
p9
aVagainst 32 of the world's best chess-playing machines
p10
aVin Hamburg, Germany.
p11
aVI won all the games,
p12
aVand then it was not considered much of a surprise
p13
aVthat I could beat 32 computers at the same time.
p14
aVTo me, that was the golden age.
p15
aa(lp16
V(Laughter)
p17
aa(lp18
VMachines were weak,
p19
aVand my hair was strong.
p20
aa(lp21
V(Laughter)
p22
aa(lp23
VJust 12 years later,
p24
aVI was fighting for my life against just one computer
p25
aVin a match
p26
aVcalled by the cover of "Newsweek"
p27
aV"The Brain's Last Stand."
p28
aVNo pressure.
p29
aa(lp30
V(Laughter)
p31
aa(lp32
VFrom mythology to science fiction,
p33
aVhuman versus machine
p34
aVhas been often portrayed as a matter of life and death.
p35
aVJohn Henry,
p36
aVcalled the steel-driving man
p37
aVin the 19th century African American folk legend,
p38
aVwas pitted in a race
p39
aVagainst a steam-powered hammer
p40
aVbashing a tunnel through mountain rock.
p41
aVJohn Henry's legend is a part of a long historical narrative
p42
aVpitting humanity versus technology.
p43
aVAnd this competitive rhetoric is standard now.
p44
aVWe are in a race against the machines,
p45
aVin a fight or even in a war.
p46
aVJobs are being killed off.
p47
aVPeople are being replaced as if they had vanished from the Earth.
p48
aVIt's enough to think that the movies like "The Terminator" or "The Matrix"
p49
aVare nonfiction.
p50
aa(lp51
VThere are very few instances of an arena
p52
aVwhere the human body and mind can compete on equal terms
p53
aVwith a computer or a robot.
p54
aVActually, I wish there were a few more.
p55
aVInstead,
p56
aVit was my blessing and my curse
p57
aVto literally become the proverbial man
p58
aVin the man versus machine competition
p59
aVthat everybody is still talking about.
p60
aVIn the most famous human-machine competition since John Henry,
p61
aVI played two matches
p62
aVagainst the IBM supercomputer, Deep Blue.
p63
aVNobody remembers that I won the first match \u2014
p64
aa(lp65
V(Laughter)
p66
aa(lp67
V(Applause)
p68
aa(lp69
VIn Philadelphia, before losing the rematch the following year in New York.
p70
aVBut I guess that's fair.
p71
aVThere is no day in history, special calendar entry
p72
aVfor all the people who failed to climb Mt. Everest
p73
aVbefore Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay
p74
aVmade it to the top.
p75
aVAnd in 1997, I was still the world champion
p76
aVwhen chess computers finally came of age.
p77
aVI was Mt. Everest,
p78
aVand Deep Blue reached the summit.
p79
aVI should say of course, not that Deep Blue did it,
p80
aVbut its human creators \u2014
p81
aVAnantharaman, Campbell, Hoane, Hsu.
p82
aVHats off to them.
p83
aVAs always, machine's triumph was a human triumph,
p84
aVsomething we tend to forget when humans are surpassed by our own creations.
p85
aa(lp86
VDeep Blue was victorious,
p87
aVbut was it intelligent?
p88
aVNo, no it wasn't,
p89
aVat least not in the way Alan Turing and other founders of computer science
p90
aVhad hoped.
p91
aVIt turned out that chess could be crunched by brute force,
p92
aVonce hardware got fast enough
p93
aVand algorithms got smart enough.
p94
aVAlthough by the definition of the output,
p95
aVgrandmaster-level chess,
p96
aVDeep Blue was intelligent.
p97
aVBut even at the incredible speed,
p98
aV200 million positions per second,
p99
aVDeep Blue's method
p100
aVprovided little of the dreamed-of insight into the mysteries of human intelligence.
p101
aa(lp102
VSoon,
p103
aVmachines will be taxi drivers
p104
aVand doctors and professors,
p105
aVbut will they be "intelligent?"
p106
aVI would rather leave these definitions
p107
aVto the philosophers and to the dictionary.
p108
aVWhat really matters is how we humans
p109
aVfeel about living and working with these machines.
p110
aa(lp111
VWhen I first met Deep Blue in 1996 in February,
p112
aVI had been the world champion for more than 10 years,
p113
aVand I had played 182 world championship games
p114
aVand hundreds of games against other top players in other competitions.
p115
aVI knew what to expect from my opponents
p116
aVand what to expect from myself.
p117
aVI was used to measure their moves
p118
aVand to gauge their emotional state
p119
aVby watching their body language and looking into their eyes.
p120
aa(lp121
VAnd then I sat across the chessboard from Deep Blue.
p122
aVI immediately sensed something new,
p123
aVsomething unsettling.
p124
aVYou might experience a similar feeling
p125
aVthe first time you ride in a driverless car
p126
aVor the first time your new computer manager issues an order at work.
p127
aVBut when I sat at that first game,
p128
aVI couldn't be sure
p129
aVwhat is this thing capable of.
p130
aVTechnology can advance in leaps, and IBM had invested heavily.
p131
aVI lost that game.
p132
aVAnd I couldn't help wondering,
p133
aVmight it be invincible?
p134
aVWas my beloved game of chess over?
p135
aVThese were human doubts, human fears,
p136
aVand the only thing I knew for sure
p137
aVwas that my opponent Deep Blue had no such worries at all.
p138
aa(lp139
V(Laughter)
p140
aa(lp141
VI fought back
p142
aVafter this devastating blow
p143
aVto win the first match,
p144
aVbut the writing was on the wall.
p145
aVI eventually lost to the machine
p146
aVbut I didn't suffer the fate of John Henry
p147
aVwho won but died with his hammer in his hand.
p148
aVIt turned out that the world of chess
p149
aVstill wanted to have a human chess champion.
p150
aVAnd even today,
p151
aVwhen a free chess app on the latest mobile phone
p152
aVis stronger than Deep Blue,
p153
aVpeople are still playing chess,
p154
aVeven more than ever before.
p155
aVDoomsayers predicted that nobody would touch the game
p156
aVthat could be conquered by the machine,
p157
aVand they were wrong, proven wrong,
p158
aVbut doomsaying has always been a popular pastime
p159
aVwhen it comes to technology.
p160
aa(lp161
VWhat I learned from my own experience
p162
aVis that we must face our fears
p163
aVif we want to get the most out of our technology,
p164
aVand we must conquer those fears
p165
aVif we want to get the best out of our humanity.
p166
aVWhile licking my wounds,
p167
aVI got a lot of inspiration
p168
aVfrom my battles against Deep Blue.
p169
aVAs the old Russian saying goes, if you can't beat them, join them.
p170
aVThen I thought,
p171
aVwhat if I could play with a computer \u2014
p172
aVtogether with a computer at my side, combining our strengths,
p173
aVhuman intuition plus machine's calculation,
p174
aVhuman strategy, machine tactics,
p175
aVhuman experience, machine's memory.
p176
aVCould it be the perfect game ever played?
p177
aa(lp178
VMy idea came to life
p179
aVin 1998 under the name of Advanced Chess
p180
aVwhen I played this human-plus-machine competition against another elite player.
p181
aVBut in this first experiment,
p182
aVwe both failed to combine human and machine skills effectively.
p183
aVAdvanced Chess found its home on the internet,
p184
aVand in 2005, a so-called freestyle chess tournament
p185
aVproduced a revelation.
p186
aVA team of grandmasters and top machines participated,
p187
aVbut the winners were not grandmasters,
p188
aVnot a supercomputer.
p189
aVThe winners were a pair of amateur American chess players
p190
aVoperating three ordinary PCs at the same time.
p191
aVTheir skill of coaching their machines
p192
aVeffectively counteracted the superior chess knowledge
p193
aVof their grandmaster opponents
p194
aVand much greater computational power of others.
p195
aVAnd I reached this formulation.
p196
aVA weak human player plus a machine
p197
aVplus a better process is superior
p198
aVto a very powerful machine alone,
p199
aVbut more remarkably, is superior to a strong human player
p200
aVplus machine
p201
aVand an inferior process.
p202
aVThis convinced me that we would need
p203
aVbetter interfaces to help us coach our machines
p204
aVtowards more useful intelligence.
p205
aa(lp206
VHuman plus machine isn't the future,
p207
aVit's the present.
p208
aVEverybody that's used online translation
p209
aVto get the gist of a news article from a foreign newspaper,
p210
aVknowing its far from perfect.
p211
aVThen we use our human experience
p212
aVto make sense out of that,
p213
aVand then the machine learns from our corrections.
p214
aVThis model is spreading and investing in medical diagnosis, security analysis.
p215
aVThe machine crunches data,
p216
aVcalculates probabilities,
p217
aVgets 80 percent of the way, 90 percent,
p218
aVmaking it easier for analysis
p219
aVand decision-making of the human party.
p220
aVBut you are not going to send your kids
p221
aVto school in a self-driving car with 90 percent accuracy,
p222
aVeven with 99 percent.
p223
aVSo we need a leap forward
p224
aVto add a few more crucial decimal places.
p225
aa(lp226
VTwenty years after my match with Deep Blue,
p227
aVsecond match,
p228
aVthis sensational "The Brain's Last Stand" headline
p229
aVhas become commonplace
p230
aVas intelligent machines
p231
aVmove
p232
aVin every sector, seemingly every day.
p233
aVBut unlike in the past,
p234
aVwhen machines replaced
p235
aVfarm animals, manual labor,
p236
aVnow they are coming after people with college degrees
p237
aVand political influence.
p238
aVAnd as someone who fought machines and lost,
p239
aVI am here to tell you this is excellent, excellent news.
p240
aVEventually, every profession
p241
aVwill have to feel these pressures
p242
aVor else it will mean humanity has ceased to make progress.
p243
aVWe don't
p244
aVget to choose
p245
aVwhen and where technological progress stops.
p246
aVWe cannot
p247
aVslow down.
p248
aVIn fact,
p249
aVwe have to speed up.
p250
aVOur technology excels at removing
p251
aVdifficulties and uncertainties from our lives,
p252
aVand so we must seek out
p253
aVever more difficult,
p254
aVever more uncertain challenges.
p255
aVMachines have
p256
aVcalculations.
p257
aVWe have understanding.
p258
aVMachines have instructions.
p259
aVWe have purpose.
p260
aVMachines have
p261
aVobjectivity.
p262
aVWe have passion.
p263
aVWe should not worry about what our machines can do today.
p264
aVInstead, we should worry about what they still cannot do today,
p265
aVbecause we will need the help of the new, intelligent machines
p266
aVto turn our grandest dreams into reality.
p267
aVAnd if we fail,
p268
aVif we fail, it's not because our machines are too intelligent,
p269
aVor not intelligent enough.
p270
aVIf we fail, it's because we grew complacent
p271
aVand limited our ambitions.
p272
aVOur humanity is not defined by any skill,
p273
aVlike swinging a hammer or even playing chess.
p274
aa(lp275
VThere's one thing only a human can do.
p276
aVThat's dream.
p277
aVSo let us dream big.
p278
