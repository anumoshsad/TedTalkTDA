VSo let me ask for a show of hands.
p4
aVHow many people here are over the age of 48?
p5
aVWell, there do seem to be a few.
p6
aa(lp7
VWell, congratulations,
p8
aVbecause if you look at this particular slide of U.S. life expectancy,
p9
aVyou are now in excess of the average life span
p10
aVof somebody who was born in 1900.
p11
aa(lp12
VBut look what happened in the course of that century.
p13
aVIf you follow that curve,
p14
aVyou'll see that it starts way down there.
p15
aVThere's that dip there for the 1918 flu.
p16
aVAnd here we are at 2010,
p17
aVaverage life expectancy of a child born today, age 79,
p18
aVand we are not done yet.
p19
aVNow, that's the good news.
p20
aVBut there's still a lot of work to do.
p21
aa(lp22
VSo, for instance, if you ask,
p23
aVhow many diseases do we now know
p24
aVthe exact molecular basis?
p25
aVTurns out it's about 4,000, which is pretty amazing,
p26
aVbecause most of those molecular discoveries
p27
aVhave just happened in the last little while.
p28
aVIt's exciting to see that in terms of what we've learned,
p29
aVbut how many of those 4,000 diseases
p30
aVnow have treatments available?
p31
aVOnly about 250.
p32
aVSo we have this huge challenge, this huge gap.
p33
aa(lp34
VYou would think this wouldn't be too hard,
p35
aVthat we would simply have the ability
p36
aVto take this fundamental information that we're learning
p37
aVabout how it is that basic biology teaches us
p38
aVabout the causes of disease
p39
aVand build a bridge across this yawning gap
p40
aVbetween what we've learned about basic science
p41
aVand its application,
p42
aVa bridge that would look maybe something like this,
p43
aVwhere you'd have to put together a nice shiny way
p44
aVto get from one side to the other.
p45
aa(lp46
VWell, wouldn't it be nice if it was that easy?
p47
aVUnfortunately, it's not.
p48
aVIn reality, trying to go from fundamental knowledge
p49
aVto its application is more like this.
p50
aVThere are no shiny bridges.
p51
aVYou sort of place your bets.
p52
aVMaybe you've got a swimmer and a rowboat
p53
aVand a sailboat and a tugboat
p54
aVand you set them off on their way,
p55
aVand the rains come and the lightning flashes,
p56
aVand oh my gosh, there are sharks in the water
p57
aVand the swimmer gets into trouble,
p58
aVand, uh oh, the swimmer drowned
p59
aVand the sailboat capsized,
p60
aVand that tugboat, well, it hit the rocks,
p61
aVand maybe if you're lucky, somebody gets across.
p62
aa(lp63
VWell, what does this really look like?
p64
aVWell, what is it to make a therapeutic, anyway?
p65
aVWhat's a drug? A drug is made up
p66
aVof a small molecule of hydrogen, carbon,
p67
aVoxygen, nitrogen, and a few other atoms
p68
aVall cobbled together in a shape,
p69
aVand it's those shapes that determine whether, in fact,
p70
aVthat particular drug is going to hit its target.
p71
aVIs it going to land where it's supposed to?
p72
aVSo look at this picture here \u2014 a lot of shapes dancing around for you.
p73
aVNow what you need to do, if you're trying to develop
p74
aVa new treatment for autism
p75
aVor Alzheimer's disease or cancer
p76
aVis to find the right shape in that mix
p77
aVthat will ultimately provide benefit and will be safe.
p78
aVAnd when you look at what happens to that pipeline,
p79
aVyou start out maybe with thousands,
p80
aVtens of thousands of compounds.
p81
aVYou weed down through various steps
p82
aVthat cause many of these to fail.
p83
aVUltimately, maybe you can run a clinical trial with four or five of these,
p84
aVand if all goes well, 14 years after you started,
p85
aVyou will get one approval.
p86
aVAnd it will cost you upwards of a billion dollars
p87
aVfor that one success.
p88
aa(lp89
VSo we have to look at this pipeline the way an engineer would,
p90
aVand say, "How can we do better?"
p91
aVAnd that's the main theme of what I want to say to you this morning.
p92
aVHow can we make this go faster?
p93
aVHow can we make it more successful?
p94
aa(lp95
VWell, let me tell you about a few examples
p96
aVwhere this has actually worked.
p97
aVOne that has just happened in the last few months
p98
aVis the successful approval of a drug for cystic fibrosis.
p99
aVBut it's taken a long time to get there.
p100
aVCystic fibrosis had its molecular cause discovered in 1989
p101
aVby my group working with another group in Toronto,
p102
aVdiscovering what the mutation was in a particular gene
p103
aVon chromosome 7.
p104
aVThat picture you see there?
p105
aVHere it is. That's the same kid.
p106
aVThat's Danny Bessette, 23 years later,
p107
aVbecause this is the year,
p108
aVand it's also the year where Danny got married,
p109
aVwhere we have, for the first time, the approval by the FDA
p110
aVof a drug that precisely targets the defect in cystic fibrosis
p111
aVbased upon all this molecular understanding.
p112
aVThat's the good news.
p113
aVThe bad news is, this drug doesn't actually treat all cases of cystic fibrosis,
p114
aVand it won't work for Danny, and we're still waiting
p115
aVfor that next generation to help him.
p116
aa(lp117
VBut it took 23 years to get this far. That's too long.
p118
aVHow do we go faster?
p119
aa(lp120
VWell, one way to go faster is to take advantage of technology,
p121
aVand a very important technology that we depend on
p122
aVfor all of this is the human genome,
p123
aVthe ability to be able to look at a chromosome,
p124
aVto unzip it, to pull out all the DNA,
p125
aVand to be able to then read out the letters in that DNA code,
p126
aVthe A's, C's, G's and T's
p127
aVthat are our instruction book and the instruction book for all living things,
p128
aVand the cost of doing this,
p129
aVwhich used to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars,
p130
aVhas in the course of the last 10 years
p131
aVfallen faster than Moore's Law, down to the point
p132
aVwhere it is less than 10,000 dollars today to have your genome sequenced, or mine,
p133
aVand we're headed for the $1,000 genome fairly soon.
p134
aVWell, that's exciting.
p135
aVHow does that play out in terms of application to a disease?
p136
aa(lp137
VI want to tell you about another disorder.
p138
aVThis one is a disorder which is quite rare.
p139
aVIt's called Hutchinson-Gilford progeria,
p140
aVand it is the most dramatic form of premature aging.
p141
aVOnly about one in every four million kids has this disease,
p142
aVand in a simple way, what happens is,
p143
aVbecause of a mutation in a particular gene,
p144
aVa protein is made that's toxic to the cell
p145
aVand it causes these individuals to age
p146
aVat about seven times the normal rate.
p147
aa(lp148
VLet me show you a video of what that does to the cell.
p149
aVThe normal cell, if you looked at it under the microscope,
p150
aVwould have a nucleus sitting in the middle of the cell,
p151
aVwhich is nice and round and smooth in its boundaries
p152
aVand it looks kind of like that.
p153
aVA progeria cell, on the other hand,
p154
aVbecause of this toxic protein called progerin,
p155
aVhas these lumps and bumps in it.
p156
aVSo what we would like to do after discovering this
p157
aVback in 2003
p158
aVis to come up with a way to try to correct that.
p159
aVWell again, by knowing something about the molecular pathways,
p160
aVit was possible to pick
p161
aVone of those many, many compounds that might have been useful
p162
aVand try it out.
p163
aVIn an experiment done in cell culture
p164
aVand shown here in a cartoon,
p165
aVif you take that particular compound
p166
aVand you add it to that cell that has progeria,
p167
aVand you watch to see what happened,
p168
aVin just 72 hours, that cell becomes,
p169
aVfor all purposes that we can determine,
p170
aValmost like a normal cell.
p171
aa(lp172
VWell that was exciting, but would it actually work in a real human being?
p173
aVThis has led, in the space of only four years
p174
aVfrom the time the gene was discovered to the start of a clinical trial,
p175
aVto a test of that very compound.
p176
aVAnd the kids that you see here
p177
aVall volunteered to be part of this,
p178
aV28 of them,
p179
aVand you can see as soon as the picture comes up
p180
aVthat they are in fact a remarkable group of young people
p181
aVall afflicted by this disease,
p182
aVall looking quite similar to each other.
p183
aVAnd instead of telling you more about it,
p184
aVI'm going to invite one of them, Sam Berns from Boston,
p185
aVwho's here this morning, to come up on the stage
p186
aVand tell us about his experience
p187
aVas a child affected with progeria.
p188
aVSam is 15 years old. His parents, Scott Berns and Leslie Gordon,
p189
aVboth physicians, are here with us this morning as well.
p190
aVSam, please have a seat.
p191
aa(lp192
V(Applause)
p193
aa(lp194
VSo Sam, why don't you tell these folks
p195
aVwhat it's like being affected with this condition called progeria?
p196
aa(lp197
VSam Burns: Well, progeria limits me in some ways.
p198
aVI cannot play sports or do physical activities,
p199
aVbut I have been able to take interest in things
p200
aVthat progeria, luckily, does not limit.
p201
aVBut when there is something that I really do want to do
p202
aVthat progeria gets in the way of, like marching band
p203
aVor umpiring, we always find a way to do it,
p204
aVand that just shows that progeria isn't in control of my life.
p205
aa(lp206
V(Applause)
p207
aa(lp208
VFrancis Collins: So what would you like to say to researchers
p209
aVhere in the auditorium and others listening to this?
p210
aVWhat would you say to them both about research on progeria
p211
aVand maybe about other conditions as well?
p212
aa(lp213
VSB: Well, research on progeria has come so far
p214
aVin less than 15 years,
p215
aVand that just shows the drive that researchers can have
p216
aVto get this far, and it really means a lot
p217
aVto myself and other kids with progeria,
p218
aVand it shows that if that drive exists,
p219
aVanybody can cure any disease,
p220
aVand hopefully progeria can be cured in the near future,
p221
aVand so we can eliminate those 4,000 diseases
p222
aVthat Francis was talking about.
p223
aa(lp224
VFC: Excellent. So Sam took the day off from school today
p225
aVto be here, and he is \u2014 (Applause) \u2014
p226
aVHe is, by the way, a straight-A+ student in the ninth grade
p227
aVin his school in Boston.
p228
aVPlease join me in thanking and welcoming Sam.
p229
aVSB: Thank you very much. FC: Well done. Well done, buddy.
p230
aV(Applause)
p231
aa(lp232
VSo I just want to say a couple more things
p233
aVabout that particular story, and then try to generalize
p234
aVhow could we have stories of success
p235
aVall over the place for these diseases, as Sam says,
p236
aVthese 4,000 that are waiting for answers.
p237
aVYou might have noticed that the drug
p238
aVthat is now in clinical trial for progeria
p239
aVis not a drug that was designed for that.
p240
aVIt's such a rare disease, it would be hard for a company
p241
aVto justify spending hundreds of millions of dollars to generate a drug.
p242
aVThis is a drug that was developed for cancer.
p243
aVTurned out, it didn't work very well for cancer,
p244
aVbut it has exactly the right properties, the right shape,
p245
aVto work for progeria, and that's what's happened.
p246
aVWouldn't it be great if we could do that more systematically?
p247
aVCould we, in fact, encourage all the companies that are out there
p248
aVthat have drugs in their freezers
p249
aVthat are known to be safe in humans
p250
aVbut have never actually succeeded in terms
p251
aVof being effective for the treatments they were tried for?
p252
aVNow we're learning about all these new molecular pathways \u2014
p253
aVsome of those could be repositioned or repurposed,
p254
aVor whatever word you want to use, for new applications,
p255
aVbasically teaching old drugs new tricks.
p256
aVThat could be a phenomenal, valuable activity.
p257
aVWe have many discussions now between NIH and companies
p258
aVabout doing this that are looking very promising.
p259
aa(lp260
VAnd you could expect quite a lot to come from this.
p261
aVThere are quite a number of success stories one can point to
p262
aVabout how this has led to major advances.
p263
aVThe first drug for HIV/AIDS
p264
aVwas not developed for HIV/AIDS.
p265
aVIt was developed for cancer. It was AZT.
p266
aVIt didn't work very well for cancer, but became
p267
aVthe first successful antiretroviral,
p268
aVand you can see from the table there are others as well.
p269
aa(lp270
VSo how do we actually make that a more generalizable effort?
p271
aVWell, we have to come up with a partnership
p272
aVbetween academia, government, the private sector,
p273
aVand patient organizations to make that so.
p274
aVAt NIH, we have started this new
p275
aVNational Center for Advancing Translational Sciences.
p276
aVIt just started last December, and this is one of its goals.
p277
aa(lp278
VLet me tell you another thing we could do.
p279
aVWouldn't it be nice to be able to a test a drug
p280
aVto see if it's effective and safe
p281
aVwithout having to put patients at risk,
p282
aVbecause that first time you're never quite sure?
p283
aVHow do we know, for instance, whether drugs are safe
p284
aVbefore we give them to people? We test them on animals.
p285
aVAnd it's not all that reliable, and it's costly,
p286
aVand it's time-consuming.
p287
aVSuppose we could do this instead on human cells.
p288
aVYou probably know, if you've been paying attention
p289
aVto some of the science literature
p290
aVthat you can now take a skin cell
p291
aVand encourage it to become a liver cell
p292
aVor a heart cell or a kidney cell or a brain cell for any of us.
p293
aVSo what if you used those cells as your test
p294
aVfor whether a drug is going to work and whether it's going to be safe?
p295
aa(lp296
VHere you see a picture of a lung on a chip.
p297
aVThis is something created by the Wyss Institute in Boston,
p298
aVand what they have done here, if we can run the little video,
p299
aVis to take cells from an individual,
p300
aVturn them into the kinds of cells that are present in the lung,
p301
aVand determine what would happen
p302
aVif you added to this various drug compounds
p303
aVto see if they are toxic or safe.
p304
aVYou can see this chip even breathes.
p305
aVIt has an air channel. It has a blood channel.
p306
aVAnd it has cells in between
p307
aVthat allow you to see what happens when you add a compound.
p308
aVAre those cells happy or not?
p309
aVYou can do this same kind of chip technology
p310
aVfor kidneys, for hearts, for muscles,
p311
aVall the places where you want to see whether a drug
p312
aVis going to be a problem, for the liver.
p313
aa(lp314
VAnd ultimately, because you can do this for the individual,
p315
aVwe could even see this moving to the point
p316
aVwhere the ability to develop and test medicines
p317
aVwill be you on a chip, what we're trying to say here is
p318
aVthe individualizing of the process of developing drugs
p319
aVand testing their safety.
p320
aa(lp321
VSo let me sum up.
p322
aVWe are in a remarkable moment here.
p323
aVFor me, at NIH now for almost 20 years,
p324
aVthere has never been a time where there was more excitement
p325
aVabout the potential that lies in front of us.
p326
aVWe have made all these discoveries
p327
aVpouring out of laboratories across the world.
p328
aVWhat do we need to capitalize on this? First of all, we need resources.
p329
aVThis is research that's high-risk, sometimes high-cost.
p330
aVThe payoff is enormous, both in terms of health
p331
aVand in terms of economic growth. We need to support that.
p332
aVSecond, we need new kinds of partnerships
p333
aVbetween academia and government and the private sector
p334
aVand patient organizations, just like the one I've been describing here,
p335
aVin terms of the way in which we could go after repurposing new compounds.
p336
aVAnd third, and maybe most important, we need talent.
p337
aVWe need the best and the brightest
p338
aVfrom many different disciplines to come and join this effort \u2014
p339
aVall ages, all different groups \u2014
p340
aVbecause this is the time, folks.
p341
aVThis is the 21st-century biology that you've been waiting for,
p342
aVand we have the chance to take that
p343
aVand turn it into something which will, in fact,
p344
aVknock out disease. That's my goal.
p345
aVI hope that's your goal.
p346
aVI think it'll be the goal of the poets and the muppets
p347
aVand the surfers and the bankers
p348
aVand all the other people who join this stage
p349
aVand think about what we're trying to do here
p350
aVand why it matters.
p351
aVIt matters for now. It matters as soon as possible.
p352
aVIf you don't believe me, just ask Sam.
p353
aa(lp354
VThank you all very much.
