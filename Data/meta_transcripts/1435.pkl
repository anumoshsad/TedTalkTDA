VUsually I like working in my shop,
p4
aVbut when it's raining and the driveway outside turns into a river,
p5
aVthen I just love it.
p6
aVAnd I'll cut some wood and drill some holes and watch the water,
p7
aVand maybe I'll have to walk around and look for washers.
p8
aVYou have no idea how much time I spend.
p9
aa(lp10
VThis is the "Double Raindrop."
p11
aVOf all my sculptures, it's the most talkative.
p12
aVIt adds together the interference pattern
p13
aVfrom two raindrops that land near each other.
p14
aVInstead of expanding circles, they're expanding hexagons.
p15
aa(lp16
VAll the sculptures move by mechanical means.
p17
aVDo you see how there's three peaks to the yellow sine wave?
p18
aVRight here I'm adding a sine wave with four peaks and turning it on.
p19
aa(lp20
VEight hundred two-liter soda bottles \u2014
p21
aVoh yea.
p22
aV(Laughter)
p23
aVFour hundred aluminum cans.
p24
aa(lp25
VTule is a reed that's native to California,
p26
aVand the best thing about working with it is that it smells just delicious.
p27
aVA single drop of rain
p28
aVincreasing amplitude.
p29
aVThe spiral eddy that trails a paddle on a rafting trip.
p30
aa(lp31
VThis adds together four different waves.
p32
aVAnd here I'm going to pull out the double wavelengths
p33
aVand increase the single.
p34
aVThe mechanism that drives it has nine motors
p35
aVand about 3,000 pulleys.
p36
aa(lp37
VFour hundred and forty-five strings in a three-dimensional weave.
p38
aVTransferred to a larger scale \u2014
p39
aVactually a lot larger, with a lot of help \u2014
p40
aV14,064 bicycle reflectors \u2014
p41
aVa 20-day install.
p42
aa(lp43
V"Connected" is a collaboration
p44
aVwith choreographer Gideon Obarzanek.
p45
aVStrings attached to dancers.
p46
aVThis is very early rehearsal footage,
p47
aVbut the finished work's on tour
p48
aVand is actually coming through L.A. in a couple weeks.
p49
aa(lp50
VA pair of helices and 40 wooden slats.
p51
aVTake your finger and draw this line.
p52
aVSummer, fall, winter, spring,
p53
aVnoon, dusk, dark, dawn.
p54
aVHave you ever seen those stratus clouds
p55
aVthat go in parallel stripes across the sky?
p56
aVDid you know that's a continuous sheet of cloud
p57
aVthat's dipping in and out of the condensation layer?
p58
aVWhat if every seemingly isolated object
p59
aVwas actually just where the continuous wave of that object
p60
aVpoked through into our world?
p61
aVThe Earth is neither flat nor round.
p62
aVIt's wavy.
p63
aa(lp64
VIt sounds good, but I'll bet you know in your gut that it's not the whole truth,
p65
aVand I'll tell you why.
p66
aVI have a two-year-old daughter who's the best thing ever.
p67
aVAnd I'm just going to come out and say it:
p68
aVMy daughter is not a wave.
p69
aVAnd you might say, "Surely, Rueben, if you took even just the slightest step back,
p70
aVthe cycles of hunger and eating,
p71
aVwaking and sleeping, laughing and crying
p72
aVwould emerge as pattern."
p73
aVBut I would say, "If I did that,
p74
aVtoo much would be lost."
p75
aa(lp76
VThis tension between the need to look deeper
p77
aVand the beauty and immediacy of the world,
p78
aVwhere if you even try to look deeper you've already missed what you're looking for,
p79
aVthis tension is what makes the sculptures move.
p80
aVAnd for me, the path between these two extremes
p81
aVtakes the shape of a wave.
p82
aa(lp83
VLet me show you one more.
p84
aVThank you very much. Thanks.
p85
aV(Applause)
p86
aa(lp87
VThanks.
p88
aa(lp89
V(Applause)

aa(lp91
VJune Cohen: Looking at each of your sculptures,
p92
aVthey evoke so many different images.
p93
aVSome of them are like the wind and some are like waves,
p94
aVand sometimes they look alive and sometimes they seem like math.
p95
aVIs there an actual inspiration behind each one?
p96
aVAre you thinking of something physical or somthing tangible as you design it?
p97
aa(lp98
VRM: Well some of them definitely have a direct observation \u2014
p99
aVlike literally two raindrops falling,
p100
aVand just watching that pattern is so stunning.
p101
aVAnd then just trying to figure out how to make that using stuff.
p102
aVI like working with my hands.
p103
aVThere's nothing better than cutting a piece of wood
p104
aVand trying to make it move.
p105
aa(lp106
VJC: And does it ever change?
p107
aVDo you think you're designing one thing,
p108
aVand then when it's produced it looks like something else?
p109
aa(lp110
VRM: The "Double Raindrop" I worked on for nine months,
p111
aVand when I finally turned it on,
p112
aVI actually hated it.
p113
aVThe very moment I turned it on, I hated it.
p114
aVIt was like a really deep-down gut reaction, and I wanted to throw it out.
p115
aVAnd I happened to have a friend who was over,
p116
aVand he said, "Why don't you just wait."
p117
aVAnd I waited, and the next day I liked it a bit better,
p118
aVthe next day I liked it a bit better, and now I really love it.
p119
aVAnd so I guess, one, the gut reactions a little bit wrong sometimes,
p120
aVand two, it does not look like as expected.
p121
aa(lp122
VJC: The relationship evolves over time.
p123
aVWell thank you so much. That was a gorgeous treat for us.
p124
aa(lp125
VRM: Thanks. (JC: Thank you, Reuben.)
