VHow would you like to be better than you are?
p4
aVSuppose I said
p5
aVthat, with just a few changes in your genes,
p6
aVyou could get a better memory \u2014
p7
aVmore precise,
p8
aVmore accurate and quicker.
p9
aVOr maybe you'd like to be more fit, stronger,
p10
aVwith more stamina.
p11
aVWould you like to be more attractive and self-confident?
p12
aVHow about living longer with good health?
p13
aVOr perhaps you're one of those
p14
aVwho's always yearned for more creativity.
p15
aVWhich one would you like the most?
p16
aVWhich would you like, if you could have just one?
p17
aV(Audience Member: Creativity.)
p18
aVCreativity.
p19
aVHow many people would choose creativity?
p20
aVRaise your hands. Let me see.
p21
aVA few. Probably about as many as there are creative people here.
p22
aV(Laughter) That's very good.
p23
aVHow many would opt for memory?
p24
aVQuite a few more.
p25
aVHow about fitness?
p26
aVA few less.
p27
aVWhat about longevity?
p28
aVAh, the majority. That makes me feel very good as a doctor.
p29
aVIf you could have any one of these,
p30
aVit would be a very different world.
p31
aVIs it just imaginary?
p32
aVOr, is it, perhaps, possible?
p33
aa(lp34
VEvolution has been a perennial topic
p35
aVhere at the TED Conference,
p36
aVbut I want to give you today
p37
aVone doctor's take on the subject.
p38
aVThe great 20th-century geneticist,
p39
aVT.G. Dobzhansky,
p40
aVwho was also a communicant
p41
aVin the Russian Orthodox Church,
p42
aVonce wrote an essay that he titled
p43
aV"Nothing in Biology Makes Sense
p44
aVExcept in the Light of Evolution."
p45
aVNow if you are one of those
p46
aVwho does not accept the evidence for biological evolution,
p47
aVthis would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid,
p48
aVtake out your personal communications device \u2014
p49
aVI give you permission \u2014
p50
aVand perhaps take another look at Kathryn Schultz's book on being wrong,
p51
aVbecause nothing in the rest of this talk
p52
aVis going to make any sense whatsoever to you.
p53
aV(Laughter)
p54
aVBut if you do accept
p55
aVbiological evolution,
p56
aVconsider this:
p57
aVis it just about the past,
p58
aVor is it about the future?
p59
aVDoes it apply to others,
p60
aVor does it apply to us?
p61
aa(lp62
VThis is another look at the tree of life.
p63
aVIn this picture,
p64
aVI've put a bush with a center branching out in all directions,
p65
aVbecause if you look at the edges
p66
aVof the tree of life,
p67
aVevery existing species
p68
aVat the tips of those branches
p69
aVhas succeeded in evolutionary terms:
p70
aVit has survived;
p71
aVit has demonstrated a fitness
p72
aVto its environment.
p73
aVThe human part of this branch,
p74
aVway out on one end,
p75
aVis, of course, the one that we are most interested in.
p76
aVWe branch off of a common ancestor
p77
aVto modern chimpanzees
p78
aVabout six or eight million years ago.
p79
aVIn the interval,
p80
aVthere have been perhaps 20 or 25
p81
aVdifferent species of hominids.
p82
aVSome have come and gone.
p83
aVWe have been here for about 130,000 years.
p84
aVIt may seem like we're quite remote
p85
aVfrom other parts of this tree of life,
p86
aVbut actually, for the most part,
p87
aVthe basic machinery of our cells
p88
aVis pretty much the same.
p89
aa(lp90
VDo you realize that we can take advantage
p91
aVand commandeer the machinery of a common bacterium
p92
aVto produce the protein of human insulin
p93
aVused to treat diabetics?
p94
aVThis is not like human insulin;
p95
aVthis is the same protein
p96
aVthat is chemically indistinguishable
p97
aVfrom what comes out of your pancreas.
p98
aVAnd speaking of bacteria,
p99
aVdo you realize that each of us carries in our gut
p100
aVmore bacteria
p101
aVthan there are cells in the rest of our body?
p102
aVMaybe 10 times more.
p103
aVI mean think of it,
p104
aVwhen Antonio Damasio asks about your self-image,
p105
aVdo you think about the bacteria?
p106
aVOur gut is a wonderfully hospitable environment
p107
aVfor those bacteria.
p108
aVIt's warm, it's dark, it's moist,
p109
aVit's very cozy.
p110
aVAnd you're going to provide all the nutrition that they could possibly want
p111
aVwith no effort on their part.
p112
aVIt's really like an Easy Street for bacteria,
p113
aVwith the occasional interruption
p114
aVof the unintended forced rush to the exit.
p115
aVBut otherwise,
p116
aVyou are a wonderful environment for those bacteria,
p117
aVjust as they are essential to your life.
p118
aVThey help in the digestion of essential nutrients,
p119
aVand they protect you against certain diseases.
p120
aa(lp121
VBut what will come in the future?
p122
aVAre we at some kind of evolutionary equipoise
p123
aVas a species?
p124
aVOr, are we destined
p125
aVto become something different \u2014
p126
aVsomething, perhaps, even better adapted
p127
aVto the environment?
p128
aVNow let's take a step back in time
p129
aVto the Big Bang, 14 billion years ago \u2014
p130
aVthe Earth, the solar system,
p131
aVabout four and a half billion years \u2014
p132
aVthe first signs of proto-life,
p133
aVmaybe three to four billion years ago on Earth \u2014
p134
aVthe first multi-celled organisms,
p135
aVperhaps as much
p136
aVas 800 or a billion years ago \u2014
p137
aVand then the human species,
p138
aVfinally emerging
p139
aVin the last 130,000 years.
p140
aVIn this vast unfinished symphony of the universe,
p141
aVlife on Earth is like a brief measure;
p142
aVthe animal kingdom,
p143
aVlike a single measure;
p144
aVand human life,
p145
aVa small grace note.
p146
aVThat was us.
p147
aVThat also constitutes the entertainment portion of this talk,
p148
aVso I hope you enjoyed it.
p149
aa(lp150
V(Laughter)
p151
aa(lp152
VNow when I was a freshman in college,
p153
aVI took my first biology class.
p154
aVI was fascinated
p155
aVby the elegance and beauty of biology.
p156
aVI became enamored of the power of evolution,
p157
aVand I realized something very fundamental:
p158
aVin most of the existence of life
p159
aVin single-celled organisms,
p160
aVeach cell simply divides,
p161
aVand all of the genetic energy of that cell
p162
aVis carried on in both daughter cells.
p163
aVBut at the time multi-celled organisms come online,
p164
aVthings start to change.
p165
aVSexual reproduction enters the picture.
p166
aVAnd very importantly,
p167
aVwith the introduction of sexual reproduction
p168
aVthat passes on the genome,
p169
aVthe rest of the body
p170
aVbecomes expendable.
p171
aVIn fact, you could say
p172
aVthat the inevitability of the death of our bodies
p173
aVenters in evolutionary time
p174
aVat the same moment
p175
aVas sexual reproduction.
p176
aa(lp177
VNow I have to confess,
p178
aVwhen I was a college undergraduate,
p179
aVI thought, okay, sex/death, sex/death, death for sex \u2014
p180
aVit seemed pretty reasonable at the time,
p181
aVbut with each passing year,
p182
aVI've come to have increasing doubts.
p183
aVI've come to understand the sentiments of George Burns,
p184
aVwho was performing still in Las Vegas
p185
aVwell into his 90s.
p186
aVAnd one night, there's a knock at his hotel room door.
p187
aVHe answers the door.
p188
aVStanding before him is a gorgeous, scantily clad showgirl.
p189
aVShe looks at him and says,
p190
aV"I'm here for super sex."
p191
aV"That's fine," says George, "I'll take the soup."
p192
aa(lp193
V(Laughter)
p194
aa(lp195
VI came to realize,
p196
aVas a physician,
p197
aVthat I was working toward a goal
p198
aVwhich was different from the goal of evolution \u2014
p199
aVnot necessarily contradictory, just different.
p200
aVI was trying to preserve the body.
p201
aVI wanted to keep us healthy.
p202
aVI wanted to restore health from disease.
p203
aVI wanted us to live long and healthy lives.
p204
aVEvolution is all about passing on the genome
p205
aVto the next generation,
p206
aVadapting and surviving
p207
aVthrough generation after generation.
p208
aVFrom an evolutionary point of view,
p209
aVyou and I are like the booster rockets
p210
aVdesigned to send the genetic payload
p211
aVinto the next level of orbit
p212
aVand then drop off into the sea.
p213
aVI think we would all understand the sentiment that Woody Allen expressed
p214
aVwhen he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work.
p215
aVI want to achieve it through not dying."
p216
aa(lp217
V(Laughter)
p218
aa(lp219
VEvolution does not necessarily
p220
aVfavor the longest-lived.
p221
aVIt doesn't necessarily favor the biggest
p222
aVor the strongest or the fastest,
p223
aVand not even the smartest.
p224
aVEvolution favors
p225
aVthose creatures best adapted
p226
aVto their environment.
p227
aVThat is the sole test
p228
aVof survival and success.
p229
aVAt the bottom of the ocean,
p230
aVbacteria that are thermophilic
p231
aVand can survive at the steam vent heat
p232
aVthat would otherwise produce, if fish were there,
p233
aVsous-vide cooked fish,
p234
aVnevertheless, have managed
p235
aVto make that a hospitable environment for them.
p236
aa(lp237
VSo what does this mean,
p238
aVas we look back at what has happened in evolution,
p239
aVand as we think about the place again
p240
aVof humans in evolution,
p241
aVand particularly as we look ahead
p242
aVto the next phase,
p243
aVI would say
p244
aVthat there are a number of possibilities.
p245
aVThe first is that we will not evolve.
p246
aVWe have reached
p247
aVa kind of equipoise.
p248
aVAnd the reasoning behind that would be,
p249
aVfirst, we have, through medicine,
p250
aVmanaged to preserve a lot of genes
p251
aVthat would otherwise be selected out
p252
aVand be removed from the population.
p253
aVAnd secondly, we as a species
p254
aVhave so configured our environment
p255
aVthat we have managed to make it adapt to us
p256
aVas well as we adapt to it.
p257
aVAnd by the way, we immigrate and circulate
p258
aVand intermix so much
p259
aVthat you can't any longer
p260
aVhave the isolation that is necessary
p261
aVfor evolution to take place.
p262
aa(lp263
VA second possibility
p264
aVis that there will be evolution of the traditional kind,
p265
aVnatural, imposed by the forces of nature.
p266
aVAnd the argument here would be
p267
aVthat the wheels of evolution grind slowly,
p268
aVbut they are inexorable.
p269
aVAnd as far as isolation goes,
p270
aVwhen we as a species
p271
aVdo colonize distant planets,
p272
aVthere will be the isolation and the environmental changes
p273
aVthat could produce evolution
p274
aVin the natural way.
p275
aa(lp276
VBut there's a third possibility,
p277
aVan enticing, intriguing and frightening possibility.
p278
aVI call it neo-evolution \u2014
p279
aVthe new evolution
p280
aVthat is not simply natural,
p281
aVbut guided and chosen
p282
aVby us as individuals
p283
aVin the choices that we will make.
p284
aVNow how could this come about?
p285
aVHow could it be possible that we would do this?
p286
aVConsider, first, the reality
p287
aVthat people today, in some cultures,
p288
aVare making choices about their offspring.
p289
aVThey're, in some cultures,
p290
aVchoosing to have more males than females.
p291
aVIt's not necessarily good for the society,
p292
aVbut it's what the individual and the family are choosing.
p293
aa(lp294
VThink also,
p295
aVif it were possible ever
p296
aVfor you to choose, not simply to choose the sex of your child,
p297
aVbut for you in your body
p298
aVto make the genetic adjustments
p299
aVthat would cure or prevent diseases.
p300
aVWhat if you could make the genetic changes
p301
aVto eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's
p302
aVor reduce the risk of cancer
p303
aVor eliminate stroke?
p304
aVWouldn't you want
p305
aVto make those changes
p306
aVin your genes?
p307
aVIf we look ahead,
p308
aVthese kind of changes
p309
aVare going to be increasingly possible.
p310
aa(lp311
VThe Human Genome Project
p312
aVstarted in 1990,
p313
aVand it took 13 years.
p314
aVIt cost 2.7 billion dollars.
p315
aVThe year after it was finished in 2004,
p316
aVyou could do the same job
p317
aVfor 20 million dollars in three to four months.
p318
aVToday, you can have a complete sequence
p319
aVof the three billion base pairs in the human genome
p320
aVat a cost of about 20,000 dollars
p321
aVand in the space of about a week.
p322
aVIt won't be very long
p323
aVbefore the reality will be
p324
aVthe 1,000-dollar human genome,
p325
aVand it will be increasingly available for everyone.
p326
aVJust a week ago,
p327
aVthe National Academy of Engineering
p328
aVawarded its Draper Prize
p329
aVto Francis Arnold and Willem Stemmer,
p330
aVtwo scientists who independently developed techniques
p331
aVto encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster
p332
aVand to lead to desirable proteins
p333
aVin a more efficient way \u2014
p334
aVwhat Frances Arnold calls "directed evolution."
p335
aVA couple of years ago, the Lasker Prize
p336
aVwas awarded to the scientist Shinya Yamanaka
p337
aVfor his research
p338
aVin which he took an adult skin cell,
p339
aVa fibroblast,
p340
aVand by manipulating just four genes,
p341
aVhe induced that cell
p342
aVto revert to a pluripotential stem cell \u2014
p343
aVa cell potentially capable
p344
aVof becoming any cell in your body.
p345
aa(lp346
VThese changes are coming.
p347
aVThe same technology
p348
aVthat has produced the human insulin in bacteria
p349
aVcan make viruses
p350
aVthat will not only protect you against themselves,
p351
aVbut induce immunity against other viruses.
p352
aVBelieve it or not,
p353
aVthere's an experimental trial going on
p354
aVwith vaccine against influenza
p355
aVthat has been grown in the cells of a tobacco plant.
p356
aVCan you imagine something good coming out of tobacco?
p357
aa(lp358
VThese are all reality today,
p359
aVand [in] the future, will be evermore possible.
p360
aVImagine then
p361
aVjust two other little changes.
p362
aVYou can change the cells in your body,
p363
aVbut what if you could change the cells in your offspring?
p364
aVWhat if you could change the sperm and the ova,
p365
aVor change the newly fertilized egg,
p366
aVand give your offspring a better chance
p367
aVat a healthier life \u2014
p368
aVeliminate the diabetes, eliminate the hemophilia,
p369
aVreduce the risk of cancer?
p370
aVWho doesn't want healthier children?
p371
aVAnd then, that same analytic technology,
p372
aVthat same engine of science
p373
aVthat can produce
p374
aVthe changes to prevent disease,
p375
aVwill also enable us
p376
aVto adopt super-attributes,
p377
aVhyper-capacities \u2014
p378
aVthat better memory.
p379
aVWhy not have the quick wit
p380
aVof a Ken Jennings,
p381
aVespecially if you can augment it
p382
aVwith the next generation of the Watson machine?
p383
aVWhy not have the quick twitch muscle
p384
aVthat will enable you to run faster and longer?
p385
aVWhy not live longer?
p386
aVThese will be irresistible.
p387
aa(lp388
VAnd when we are at a position
p389
aVwhere we can pass it on to the next generation,
p390
aVand we can adopt the attributes we want,
p391
aVwe will have converted
p392
aVold-style evolution
p393
aVinto neo-evolution.
p394
aVWe'll take a process
p395
aVthat normally might require 100,000 years,
p396
aVand we can compress it down to a thousand years \u2014
p397
aVand maybe even in the next 100 years.
p398
aVThese are choices
p399
aVthat your grandchildren,
p400
aVor their grandchildren,
p401
aVare going to have before them.
p402
aVWill we use these choices
p403
aVto make a society that is better,
p404
aVthat is more successful, that is kinder?
p405
aVOr, will we selectively choose different attributes
p406
aVthat we want for some of us
p407
aVand not for others of us?
p408
aVWill we make a society
p409
aVthat is more boring and more uniform,
p410
aVor more robust and more versatile?
p411
aVThese are the kinds of questions
p412
aVthat we will have to face.
p413
aa(lp414
VAnd most profoundly of all,
p415
aVwill we ever be able to develop the wisdom,
p416
aVand to inherit the wisdom,
p417
aVthat we'll need to make these choices wisely?
p418
aVFor better or worse,
p419
aVand sooner than you may think,
p420
aVthese choices will be up to us.
