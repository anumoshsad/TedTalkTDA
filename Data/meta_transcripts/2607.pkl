VToday I stand before you as a man who lives life to the full
p4
aVin the here and now.
p5
aVBut for a long time,
p6
aVI lived for death.
p7
aa(lp8
VI was a young man who believed
p9
aVthat jihad is to be understood in the language of force and violence.
p10
aVI tried to right wrongs through power and aggression.
p11
aVI had deep concerns for the suffering of others
p12
aVand a strong desire to help and bring relief to them.
p13
aVI thought violent jihad was noble,
p14
aVchivalrous
p15
aVand the best way to help.
p16
aa(lp17
VAt a time when so many of our people \u2014
p18
aVyoung people especially \u2014
p19
aVare at risk of radicalization
p20
aVthrough groups like al-Qaeda,
p21
aVIslamic State and others,
p22
aVwhen these groups are claiming
p23
aVthat their horrific brutality and violence are true jihad,
p24
aVI want to say that their idea of jihad is wrong \u2014
p25
aVcompletely wrong \u2014
p26
aVas was mine, then.
p27
aa(lp28
VJihad means to strive to one's utmost.
p29
aVIt includes exertion and spirituality,
p30
aVself-purification
p31
aVand devotion.
p32
aVIt refers to positive transformation
p33
aVthrough learning, wisdom and remembrance of God.
p34
aVThe word jihad stands for all those meanings as a whole.
p35
aVJihad may at times take the form of fighting,
p36
aVbut only sometimes,
p37
aVunder strict conditions,
p38
aVwithin rules and limits.
p39
aa(lp40
VIn Islam,
p41
aVthe benefit of an act must outweigh the harm or hardship it entails.
p42
aVMore importantly,
p43
aVthe verses in the Koran that are connected to jihad or fighting
p44
aVdo not cancel out the verses that talk about forgiveness,
p45
aVbenevolence
p46
aVor patience.
p47
aa(lp48
VBut now I believe that there are no circumstances on earth
p49
aVwhere violent jihad is permissible,
p50
aVbecause it will lead to greater harm.
p51
aVBut now the idea of jihad has been hijacked.
p52
aVIt has been perverted to mean violent struggle
p53
aVwherever Muslims are undergoing difficulties,
p54
aVand turned into terrorism
p55
aVby fascistic Islamists like al-Qaeda,
p56
aVIslamic State and others.
p57
aVBut I have come to understand
p58
aVthat true jihad means striving to the utmost
p59
aVto strengthen and live those qualities which God loves:
p60
aVhonesty, trustworthiness,
p61
aVcompassion, benevolence,
p62
aVreliability, respect,
p63
aVtruthfulness \u2014
p64
aVhuman values that so many of us share.
p65
aa(lp66
VI was born in Bangladesh,
p67
aVbut grew up mostly in England.
p68
aVAnd I went to school here.
p69
aVMy father was an academic,
p70
aVand we were in the UK through his work.
p71
aa(lp72
VIn 1971 we were in Bangladesh when everything changed.
p73
aVThe War of Independence impacted upon us terribly,
p74
aVpitting family against family,
p75
aVneighbor against neighbor.
p76
aVAnd at the age of 12 I experienced war,
p77
aVdestitution in my family,
p78
aVthe deaths of 22 of my relatives in horrible ways,
p79
aVas well as the murder of my elder brother.
p80
aVI witnessed killing ...
p81
aVanimals feeding on corpses in the streets,
p82
aVstarvation all around me,
p83
aVwanton, horrific violence \u2014
p84
aVsenseless violence.
p85
aVI was a young man,
p86
aVteenager, fascinated by ideas.
p87
aVI wanted to learn,
p88
aVbut I could not go to school for four years.
p89
aa(lp90
VAfter the War of Independence,
p91
aVmy father was put in prison for two and a half years,
p92
aVand I used to visit him every week in prison,
p93
aVand homeschooled myself.
p94
aVMy father was released in 1973
p95
aVand he fled to England as a refugee,
p96
aVand we soon followed him.
p97
aVI was 17.
p98
aa(lp99
VSo these experiences gave me
p100
aVa sharp awareness of the atrocities and injustices in the world.
p101
aVAnd I had a strong desire \u2014
p102
aVa very keen, deep desire \u2014
p103
aVto right wrongs
p104
aVand help the victims of oppression.
p105
aa(lp106
VWhile studying at college in the UK,
p107
aVI met others who showed me how I could channel that desire
p108
aVand help through my religion.
p109
aVAnd I was radicalized \u2014
p110
aVenough to consider violence correct,
p111
aVeven a virtue under certain circumstances.
p112
aa(lp113
VSo I became involved in the jihad in Afghanistan.
p114
aVI wanted to protect the Muslim Afghan population against the Soviet army.
p115
aVAnd I thought that was jihad:
p116
aVmy sacred duty,
p117
aVwhich would be rewarded by God.
p118
aa(lp119
VI became a preacher.
p120
aVI was one of the pioneers of violent jihad in the UK.
p121
aVI recruited,
p122
aVI raised funds, I trained.
p123
aVI confused true jihad
p124
aVwith this perversion as presented by the fascist Islamists \u2014
p125
aVthese people who use the idea of jihad
p126
aVto justify their lust for power, authority and control on earth:
p127
aVa perversion perpetuated today by fascist Islamist groups
p128
aVlike al-Qaeda, Islamic State and others.
p129
aa(lp130
VFor a period of around 15 years,
p131
aVI fought for short periods of time
p132
aVin Kashmir and Burma,
p133
aVbesides Afghanistan.
p134
aVOur aim was to remove the invaders,
p135
aVto bring relief to the oppressed victims
p136
aVand of course to establish an Islamic state,
p137
aVa caliphate for God's rule.
p138
aVAnd I did this openly.
p139
aVI didn't break any laws.
p140
aVI was proud and grateful to be British \u2014
p141
aVI still am.
p142
aVAnd I bore no hostility against this, my country,
p143
aVnor enmity towards the non-Muslim citizens,
p144
aVand I still don't.
p145
aa(lp146
VDuring one battle in Afghanistan,
p147
aVsome British men and I formed a special bond
p148
aVwith a 15-year-old Afghani boy,
p149
aVAbdullah,
p150
aVan innocent, loving and lovable kid
p151
aVwho was always eager to please.
p152
aVHe was poor.
p153
aVAnd boys like him did menial tasks in the camp.
p154
aVAnd he seemed happy enough,
p155
aVbut I couldn't help wonder \u2014
p156
aVhis parents must have missed him dearly.
p157
aVAnd they must have dreamt about a better future for him.
p158
aVA victim of circumstance caught up in a war,
p159
aVcruelly thrust upon him
p160
aVby the cruel circumstances of the time.
p161
aa(lp162
VOne day I picked up this unexploded mortar shell in a trench,
p163
aVand I had it deposited in a makeshift mud hut lab.
p164
aVAnd I went out on a short, pointless skirmish \u2014
p165
aValways pointless,
p166
aVAnd I came back a few hours later to discover he was dead.
p167
aVHe had tried to recover explosives from that shell.
p168
aVIt exploded, and he died a violent death,
p169
aVblown to bits by the very same device that had proved harmless to me.
p170
aVSo I started to question.
p171
aVHow did his death serve any purpose?
p172
aVWhy did he die and I lived?
p173
aa(lp174
VI carried on.
p175
aVI fought in Kashmir.
p176
aVI also recruited for the Philippines,
p177
aVBosnia and Chechnya.
p178
aVAnd the questions grew.
p179
aa(lp180
VLater in Burma,
p181
aVI came across Rohingya fighters,
p182
aVwho were barely teenagers,
p183
aVborn and brought up in the jungle,
p184
aVcarrying machine guns and grenade launchers.
p185
aVI met two 13-year-olds with soft manners and gentle voices.
p186
aVLooking at me,
p187
aVthey begged me to take them away to England.
p188
aVThey simply wanted to go to school \u2014
p189
aVthat was their dream.
p190
aVMy family \u2014
p191
aVmy children of the same age \u2014
p192
aVwere living at home in the UK,
p193
aVgoing to school,
p194
aVliving a safe life.
p195
aVAnd I couldn't help wonder
p196
aVhow much these young boys must have spoken to one another
p197
aVabout their dreams for such a life.
p198
aVVictims of circumstances:
p199
aVthese two young boys,
p200
aVsleeping rough on the ground, looking up at the stars,
p201
aVcynically exploited by their leaders
p202
aVfor their personal lust for glory and power.
p203
aa(lp204
VI soon witnessed boys like them killing one another
p205
aVin conflicts between rival groups.
p206
aVAnd it was the same everywhere ...
p207
aVAfghanistan, Kashmir, Burma,
p208
aVPhilippines, Chechnya;
p209
aVpetty warlords got the young and vulnerable to kill one another
p210
aVin the name of jihad.
p211
aVMuslims against Muslims.
p212
aVNot protecting anyone against invaders or occupiers;
p213
aVnot bringing relief to the oppressed.
p214
aVChildren being used,
p215
aVcynically exploited;
p216
aVpeople dying in conflicts
p217
aVwhich I was supporting in the name of jihad.
p218
aVAnd it still carries on today.
p219
aa(lp220
VRealizing that the violent jihad
p221
aVI had engaged in abroad
p222
aVwas so different \u2014
p223
aVsuch a chasm between what I had experienced
p224
aVand what I thought was sacred duty \u2014
p225
aVI had to reflect on my activities here in the UK.
p226
aVI had to consider my preaching,
p227
aVrecruiting, fund-raising,
p228
aVtraining,
p229
aVbut most importantly, radicalizing \u2014
p230
aVsending young people to fight and die
p231
aVas I was doing \u2014
p232
aVall totally wrong.
p233
aa(lp234
VSo I got involved in violent jihad in the mid '80s,
p235
aVstarting with Afghanistan.
p236
aVAnd by the time I finished it was in the year 2000.
p237
aVI was completely immersed in it.
p238
aVAll around me people supported,
p239
aVapplauded,
p240
aVeven celebrated what we were doing in their name.
p241
aVBut by the time I learned to get out,
p242
aVcompletely disillusioned in the year 2000,
p243
aV15 years had passed.
p244
aa(lp245
VSo what goes wrong?
p246
aVWe were so busy talking about virtue,
p247
aVand we were blinded by a cause.
p248
aVAnd we did not give ourselves a chance to develop a virtuous character.
p249
aVWe told ourselves we were fighting for the oppressed,
p250
aVbut these were unwinnable wars.
p251
aVWe became the very instrument through which more deaths occurred,
p252
aVcomplicit in causing further misery
p253
aVfor the selfish benefit of the cruel few.
p254
aa(lp255
VSo over time,
p256
aVa very long time,
p257
aVI opened my eyes.
p258
aVI began to dare
p259
aVto face the truth,
p260
aVto think,
p261
aVto face the hard questions.
p262
aVI got in touch with my soul.
p263
aa(lp264
VWhat have I learned?
p265
aVThat people who engage in violent jihadism,
p266
aVthat people who are drawn to these types of extremisms,
p267
aVare not that different to everyone else.
p268
aVBut I believe such people can change.
p269
aVThey can regain their hearts and restore them
p270
aVby filling them with human values that heal.
p271
aa(lp272
VWhen we ignore the realities,
p273
aVwe discover that we accept what we are told without critical reflection.
p274
aVAnd we ignore the gifts and advantages that many of us would cherish
p275
aVeven for a single moment in their lives.
p276
aVI engaged in actions I thought were correct.
p277
aVBut now I began to question how I knew what I knew.
p278
aVI endlessly told others to accept the truth,
p279
aVbut I failed to give doubt its rightful place.
p280
aa(lp281
VThis conviction that people can change is rooted in my experience,
p282
aVmy own journey.
p283
aVThrough wide reading,
p284
aVreflecting,
p285
aVcontemplation, self-knowledge,
p286
aVI discovered,
p287
aVI realized that Islamists' world of us and them is false and unjust.
p288
aVThrough considering the uncertainties in all that we had asserted,
p289
aVto the inviolable truths,
p290
aVincontestable truths,
p291
aVI developed a more nuanced understanding.
p292
aa(lp293
VI realized that in a world crowded with variation and contradiction,
p294
aVfoolish preachers,
p295
aVonly foolish preachers like I used to be,
p296
aVsee no paradox in the myths and fictions they use to assert authenticity.
p297
aVSo I understood the vital importance of self-knowledge,
p298
aVpolitical awareness
p299
aVand the necessity for a deep and wide understanding
p300
aVof our commitments and our actions,
p301
aVhow they affect others.
p302
aa(lp303
VSo my plea today to everyone,
p304
aVespecially those who sincerely believe in Islamist jihadism ...
p305
aVrefuse dogmatic authority;
p306
aVlet go of anger, hatred and violence;
p307
aVlearn to right wrongs
p308
aVwithout even attempting to justify cruel, unjust and futile behavior.
p309
aVInstead create a few beautiful and useful things
p310
aVthat outlive us.
p311
aVApproach the world, life,
p312
aVwith love.
p313
aVLearn to develop
p314
aVor cultivate your hearts
p315
aVto see goodness, beauty and truth in others and in the world.
p316
aVThat way we do matter more to ourselves ...
p317
aVto each other,
p318
aVto our communities
p319
aVand, for me, to God.
p320
aVThis is jihad \u2014
p321
aVmy true jihad.
p322
aa(lp323
VThank you.
