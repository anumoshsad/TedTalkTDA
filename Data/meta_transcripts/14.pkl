VImagine spending seven years at MIT and research laboratories,
p4
aVonly to find out that you're a performance artist.

aa(lp8
VI'm also a software engineer,
p9
aVand I make lots of different kinds of art with the computer.
p10
aVAnd I think the main thing that I'm interested in
p11
aVis trying to find a way of
p12
aVmaking the computer into a personal mode of expression.
p13
aVAnd many of you out there are the heads of Macromedia and Microsoft,
p14
aVand in a way those are my bane:
p15
aVI think there's a great homogenizing force
p16
aVthat software imposes on people and limits the way they think
p17
aVabout what's possible on the computer.
p18
aVOf course, it's also a great liberating force that makes possible,
p19
aVyou know, publishing and so forth, and standards, and so on.
p20
aVBut, in a way, the computer makes possible much more
p21
aVthan what most people think, and my art has just been about
p22
aVtrying to find a personal way of using the computer,
p23
aVand so I end up writing software to do that.
p24
aa(lp25
VChris has asked me to do a short performance,
p26
aVand so I'm going to take just this time \u2014 maybe 10 minutes \u2014
p27
aVto do that, and hopefully at the end have just a moment
p28
aVto show you a couple of my other projects in video form.
p29
aa(lp30
VThank you.
p31
aa(lp32
V(Applause)
p33
aa(lp34
VWe've got about a minute left.
p35
aVI'd just like to show a clip from a most recent project.
p36
aVI did a performance with two singers
p37
aVwho specialize in making strange noises with their mouths.
p38
aVAnd this just came off last September at ARS Electronica;
p39
aVwe repeated it in England.
p40
aVAnd the idea is to visualize their speech and song behind them
p41
aVwith a large screen.
p42
aVWe used a computer vision tracking system
p43
aVin order to know where they were.
p44
aVAnd since we know where their heads are,
p45
aVand we have a wireless mic on them
p46
aVthat we're processing the sound from,
p47
aVwe're able to create visualizations
p48
aVwhich are linked very tightly to what they're doing with their speech.
p49
aVThis will take about 30 seconds or so.
p50
aVHe's making a, kind of, cheek-flapping sound.
p51
aa(lp52
VWell, suffice it to say it's not all like that, but that's part of it.
p53
aa(lp54
VThanks very much. There's always lots more.
p55
aVI'm overtime, so I just wanted to say you can, if you're in New York,
p56
aVyou can check out my work at the Whitney Biennial next week,
p57
aVand also at Bitforms Gallery in Chelsea.
p58
aVAnd with that, I think I should give up the stage,
p59
aVso, thank you so much.
