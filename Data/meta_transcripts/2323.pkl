VChris Anderson: You were something of a mathematical phenom.
p4
aVYou had already taught at Harvard and MIT at a young age.
p5
aVAnd then the NSA came calling.
p6
aVWhat was that about?
p7
aa(lp8
VJim Simons: Well the NSA \u2014 that's the National Security Agency \u2014
p9
aVthey didn't exactly come calling.
p10
aVThey had an operation at Princeton, where they hired mathematicians
p11
aVto attack secret codes and stuff like that.
p12
aVAnd I knew that existed.
p13
aVAnd they had a very good policy,
p14
aVbecause you could do half your time at your own mathematics,
p15
aVand at least half your time working on their stuff.
p16
aVAnd they paid a lot.
p17
aVSo that was an irresistible pull.
p18
aVSo, I went there.
p19
aa(lp20
VCA: You were a code-cracker.
p21
aa(lp22
VJS: I was.
p23
aa(lp24
VCA: Until you got fired.
p25
aa(lp26
VJS: Well, I did get fired. Yes.
p27
aa(lp28
VCA: How come?
p29
aa(lp30
VJS: Well, how come?
p31
aVI got fired because, well, the Vietnam War was on,
p32
aVand the boss of bosses in my organization was a big fan of the war
p33
aVand wrote a New York Times article, a magazine section cover story,
p34
aVabout how we would win in Vietnam.
p35
aVAnd I didn't like that war, I thought it was stupid.
p36
aVAnd I wrote a letter to the Times, which they published,
p37
aVsaying not everyone who works for Maxwell Taylor,
p38
aVif anyone remembers that name, agrees with his views.
p39
aVAnd I gave my own views ...
p40
aa(lp41
VCA: Oh, OK. I can see that would \u2014
p42
aa(lp43
VJS: ... which were different from General Taylor's.
p44
aVBut in the end, nobody said anything.
p45
aVBut then, I was 29 years old at this time, and some kid came around
p46
aVand said he was a stringer from Newsweek magazine
p47
aVand he wanted to interview me and ask what I was doing about my views.
p48
aVAnd I told him, "I'm doing mostly mathematics now,
p49
aVand when the war is over, then I'll do mostly their stuff."
p50
aVThen I did the only intelligent thing I'd done that day \u2014
p51
aVI told my local boss that I gave that interview.
p52
aVAnd he said, "What'd you say?"
p53
aVAnd I told him what I said.
p54
aVAnd then he said, "I've got to call Taylor."
p55
aVHe called Taylor; that took 10 minutes.
p56
aVI was fired five minutes after that.
p57
aa(lp58
VCA: OK.
p59
aa(lp60
VJS: But it wasn't bad.
p61
aa(lp62
VCA: It wasn't bad, because you went on to Stony Brook
p63
aVand stepped up your mathematical career.
p64
aVYou started working with this man here.
p65
aVWho is this?
p66
aa(lp67
VJS: Oh, [Shiing-Shen] Chern.
p68
aVChern was one of the great mathematicians of the century.
p69
aVI had known him when I was a graduate student at Berkeley.
p70
aVAnd I had some ideas,
p71
aVand I brought them to him and he liked them.
p72
aVTogether, we did this work which you can easily see up there.
p73
aVThere it is.
p74
aa(lp75
VCA: It led to you publishing a famous paper together.
p76
aVCan you explain at all what that work was?
p77
aa(lp78
VJS: No.
p79
aa(lp80
V(Laughter)
p81
aa(lp82
VJS: I mean, I could explain it to somebody.
p83
aa(lp84
V(Laughter)
p85
aa(lp86
VCA: How about explaining this?
p87
aa(lp88
VJS: But not many. Not many people.
p89
aa(lp90
VCA: I think you told me it had something to do with spheres,
p91
aVso let's start here.
p92
aa(lp93
VJS: Well, it did, but I'll say about that work \u2014
p94
aVit did have something to do with that, but before we get to that \u2014
p95
aVthat work was good mathematics.
p96
aVI was very happy with it; so was Chern.
p97
aVIt even started a little sub-field that's now flourishing.
p98
aVBut, more interestingly, it happened to apply to physics,
p99
aVsomething we knew nothing about \u2014 at least I knew nothing about physics,
p100
aVand I don't think Chern knew a heck of a lot.
p101
aVAnd about 10 years after the paper came out,
p102
aVa guy named Ed Witten in Princeton started applying it to string theory
p103
aVand people in Russia started applying it to what's called "condensed matter."
p104
aVToday, those things in there called Chern-Simons invariants
p105
aVhave spread through a lot of physics.
p106
aVAnd it was amazing.
p107
aVWe didn't know any physics.
p108
aVIt never occurred to me that it would be applied to physics.
p109
aVBut that's the thing about mathematics \u2014 you never know where it's going to go.
p110
aa(lp111
VCA: This is so incredible.
p112
aVSo, we've been talking about how evolution shapes human minds
p113
aVthat may or may not perceive the truth.
p114
aVSomehow, you come up with a mathematical theory,
p115
aVnot knowing any physics,
p116
aVdiscover two decades later that it's being applied
p117
aVto profoundly describe the actual physical world.
p118
aVHow can that happen?
p119
aa(lp120
VJS: God knows.
p121
aa(lp122
V(Laughter)
p123
aa(lp124
VBut there's a famous physicist named [Eugene] Wigner,
p125
aVand he wrote an essay on the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics.
p126
aVSomehow, this mathematics, which is rooted in the real world
p127
aVin some sense \u2014 we learn to count, measure, everyone would do that \u2014
p128
aVand then it flourishes on its own.
p129
aVBut so often it comes back to save the day.
p130
aVGeneral relativity is an example.
p131
aV[Hermann] Minkowski had this geometry, and Einstein realized,
p132
aV"Hey! It's the very thing in which I can cast general relativity."
p133
aVSo, you never know. It is a mystery.
p134
aVIt is a mystery.
p135
aa(lp136
VCA: So, here's a mathematical piece of ingenuity.
p137
aVTell us about this.
p138
aa(lp139
VJS: Well, that's a ball \u2014 it's a sphere, and it has a lattice around it \u2014
p140
aVyou know, those squares.
p141
aVWhat I'm going to show here was originally observed by [Leonhard] Euler,
p142
aVthe great mathematician, in the 1700s.
p143
aVAnd it gradually grew to be a very important field in mathematics:
p144
aValgebraic topology, geometry.
p145
aVThat paper up there had its roots in this.
p146
aVSo, here's this thing:
p147
aVit has eight vertices, 12 edges, six faces.
p148
aVAnd if you look at the difference \u2014 vertices minus edges plus faces \u2014
p149
aVyou get two.
p150
aVOK, well, two. That's a good number.
p151
aVHere's a different way of doing it \u2014 these are triangles covering \u2014
p152
aVthis has 12 vertices and 30 edges
p153
aVand 20 faces, 20 tiles.
p154
aVAnd vertices minus edges plus faces still equals two.
p155
aVAnd in fact, you could do this any which way \u2014
p156
aVcover this thing with all kinds of polygons and triangles
p157
aVand mix them up.
p158
aVAnd you take vertices minus edges plus faces \u2014 you'll get two.
p159
aVHere's a different shape.
p160
aVThis is a torus, or the surface of a doughnut: 16 vertices
p161
aVcovered by these rectangles, 32 edges, 16 faces.
p162
aVVertices minus edges comes out to be zero.
p163
aVIt'll always come out to zero.
p164
aVEvery time you cover a torus with squares or triangles
p165
aVor anything like that, you're going to get zero.
p166
aVSo, this is called the Euler characteristic.
p167
aVAnd it's what's called a topological invariant.
p168
aVIt's pretty amazing.
p169
aVNo matter how you do it, you're always get the same answer.
p170
aVSo that was the first sort of thrust, from the mid-1700s,
p171
aVinto a subject which is now called algebraic topology.
p172
aa(lp173
VCA: And your own work took an idea like this and moved it
p174
aVinto higher-dimensional theory,
p175
aVhigher-dimensional objects, and found new invariances?
p176
aa(lp177
VJS: Yes. Well, there were already higher-dimensional invariants:
p178
aVPontryagin classes \u2014 actually, there were Chern classes.
p179
aVThere were a bunch of these types of invariants.
p180
aVI was struggling to work on one of them
p181
aVand model it sort of combinatorially,
p182
aVinstead of the way it was typically done,
p183
aVand that led to this work and we uncovered some new things.
p184
aVBut if it wasn't for Mr. Euler \u2014
p185
aVwho wrote almost 70 volumes of mathematics
p186
aVand had 13 children,
p187
aVwho he apparently would dandle on his knee while he was writing \u2014
p188
aVif it wasn't for Mr. Euler, there wouldn't perhaps be these invariants.
p189
aa(lp190
VCA: OK, so that's at least given us a flavor of that amazing mind in there.
p191
aVLet's talk about Renaissance.
p192
aVBecause you took that amazing mind and having been a code-cracker at the NSA,
p193
aVyou started to become a code-cracker in the financial industry.
p194
aVI think you probably didn't buy efficient market theory.
p195
aVSomehow you found a way of creating astonishing returns over two decades.
p196
aVThe way it's been explained to me,
p197
aVwhat's remarkable about what you did wasn't just the size of the returns,
p198
aVit's that you took them with surprisingly low volatility and risk,
p199
aVcompared with other hedge funds.
p200
aVSo how on earth did you do this, Jim?
p201
aa(lp202
VJS: I did it by assembling a wonderful group of people.
p203
aVWhen I started doing trading, I had gotten a little tired of mathematics.
p204
aVI was in my late 30s, I had a little money.
p205
aVI started trading and it went very well.
p206
aVI made quite a lot of money with pure luck.
p207
aVI mean, I think it was pure luck.
p208
aVIt certainly wasn't mathematical modeling.
p209
aVBut in looking at the data, after a while I realized:
p210
aVit looks like there's some structure here.
p211
aVAnd I hired a few mathematicians, and we started making some models \u2014
p212
aVjust the kind of thing we did back at IDA [Institute for Defense Analyses].
p213
aVYou design an algorithm, you test it out on a computer.
p214
aVDoes it work? Doesn't it work? And so on.
p215
aa(lp216
VCA: Can we take a look at this?
p217
aVBecause here's a typical graph of some commodity.
p218
aVI look at that, and I say, "That's just a random, up-and-down walk \u2014
p219
aVmaybe a slight upward trend over that whole period of time."
p220
aVHow on earth could you trade looking at that,
p221
aVand see something that wasn't just random?
p222
aa(lp223
VJS: In the old days \u2014 this is kind of a graph from the old days,
p224
aVcommodities or currencies had a tendency to trend.
p225
aVNot necessarily the very light trend you see here, but trending in periods.
p226
aVAnd if you decided, OK, I'm going to predict today,
p227
aVby the average move in the past 20 days \u2014
p228
aVmaybe that would be a good prediction, and I'd make some money.
p229
aVAnd in fact, years ago, such a system would work \u2014
p230
aVnot beautifully, but it would work.
p231
aVYou'd make money, you'd lose money, you'd make money.
p232
aVBut this is a year's worth of days,
p233
aVand you'd make a little money during that period.
p234
aVIt's a very vestigial system.
p235
aa(lp236
VCA: So you would test a bunch of lengths of trends in time
p237
aVand see whether, for example,
p238
aVa 10-day trend or a 15-day trend was predictive of what happened next.
p239
aa(lp240
VJS: Sure, you would try all those things and see what worked best.
p241
aVTrend-following would have been great in the '60s,
p242
aVand it was sort of OK in the '70s.
p243
aVBy the '80s, it wasn't.
p244
aa(lp245
VCA: Because everyone could see that.
p246
aVSo, how did you stay ahead of the pack?
p247
aa(lp248
VJS: We stayed ahead of the pack by finding other approaches \u2014
p249
aVshorter-term approaches to some extent.
p250
aVThe real thing was to gather a tremendous amount of data \u2014
p251
aVand we had to get it by hand in the early days.
p252
aVWe went down to the Federal Reserve and copied interest rate histories
p253
aVand stuff like that, because it didn't exist on computers.
p254
aVWe got a lot of data.
p255
aVAnd very smart people \u2014 that was the key.
p256
aVI didn't really know how to hire people to do fundamental trading.
p257
aVI had hired a few \u2014 some made money, some didn't make money.
p258
aVI couldn't make a business out of that.
p259
aVBut I did know how to hire scientists,
p260
aVbecause I have some taste in that department.
p261
aVSo, that's what we did.
p262
aVAnd gradually these models got better and better,
p263
aVand better and better.
p264
aa(lp265
VCA: You're credited with doing something remarkable at Renaissance,
p266
aVwhich is building this culture, this group of people,
p267
aVwho weren't just hired guns who could be lured away by money.
p268
aVTheir motivation was doing exciting mathematics and science.
p269
aa(lp270
VJS: Well, I'd hoped that might be true.
p271
aVBut some of it was money.
p272
aa(lp273
VCA: They made a lot of money.
p274
aa(lp275
VJS: I can't say that no one came because of the money.
p276
aVI think a lot of them came because of the money.
p277
aVBut they also came because it would be fun.
p278
aa(lp279
VCA: What role did machine learning play in all this?
p280
aa(lp281
VJS: In a certain sense, what we did was machine learning.
p282
aVYou look at a lot of data, and you try to simulate different predictive schemes,
p283
aVuntil you get better and better at it.
p284
aVIt doesn't necessarily feed back on itself the way we did things.
p285
aVBut it worked.
p286
aa(lp287
VCA: So these different predictive schemes can be really quite wild and unexpected.
p288
aVI mean, you looked at everything, right?
p289
aVYou looked at the weather, length of dresses, political opinion.
p290
aa(lp291
VJS: Yes, length of dresses we didn't try.
p292
aa(lp293
VCA: What sort of things?
p294
aa(lp295
VJS: Well, everything.
p296
aVEverything is grist for the mill \u2014 except hem lengths.
p297
aVWeather, annual reports,
p298
aVquarterly reports, historic data itself, volumes, you name it.
p299
aVWhatever there is.
p300
aVWe take in terabytes of data a day.
p301
aVAnd store it away and massage it and get it ready for analysis.
p302
aVYou're looking for anomalies.
p303
aVYou're looking for \u2014 like you said,
p304
aVthe efficient market hypothesis is not correct.
p305
aa(lp306
VCA: But any one anomaly might be just a random thing.
p307
aVSo, is the secret here to just look at multiple strange anomalies,
p308
aVand see when they align?
p309
aa(lp310
VJS: Any one anomaly might be a random thing;
p311
aVhowever, if you have enough data you can tell that it's not.
p312
aVYou can see an anomaly that's persistent for a sufficiently long time \u2014
p313
aVthe probability of it being random is not high.
p314
aVBut these things fade after a while; anomalies can get washed out.
p315
aVSo you have to keep on top of the business.
p316
aa(lp317
VCA: A lot of people look at the hedge fund industry now
p318
aVand are sort of ... shocked by it,
p319
aVby how much wealth is created there,
p320
aVand how much talent is going into it.
p321
aVDo you have any worries about that industry,
p322
aVand perhaps the financial industry in general?
p323
aVKind of being on a runaway train that's \u2014
p324
aVI don't know \u2014 helping increase inequality?
p325
aVHow would you champion what's happening in the hedge fund industry?
p326
aa(lp327
VJS: I think in the last three or four years,
p328
aVhedge funds have not done especially well.
p329
aVWe've done dandy,
p330
aVbut the hedge fund industry as a whole has not done so wonderfully.
p331
aVThe stock market has been on a roll, going up as everybody knows,
p332
aVand price-earnings ratios have grown.
p333
aVSo an awful lot of the wealth that's been created in the last \u2014
p334
aVlet's say, five or six years \u2014 has not been created by hedge funds.
p335
aVPeople would ask me, "What's a hedge fund?"
p336
aVAnd I'd say, "One and 20."
p337
aVWhich means \u2014 now it's two and 20 \u2014
p338
aVit's two percent fixed fee and 20 percent of profits.
p339
aVHedge funds are all different kinds of creatures.
p340
aa(lp341
VCA: Rumor has it you charge slightly higher fees than that.
p342
aa(lp343
VJS: We charged the highest fees in the world at one time.
p344
aVFive and 44, that's what we charge.
p345
aa(lp346
VCA: Five and 44.
p347
aVSo five percent flat, 44 percent of upside.
p348
aVYou still made your investors spectacular amounts of money.
p349
aa(lp350
VJS: We made good returns, yes.
p351
aVPeople got very mad: "How can you charge such high fees?"
p352
aVI said, "OK, you can withdraw."
p353
aVBut "How can I get more?" was what people were \u2014
p354
aa(lp355
V(Laughter)
p356
aa(lp357
VBut at a certain point, as I think I told you,
p358
aVwe bought out all the investors because there's a capacity to the fund.
p359
aa(lp360
VCA: But should we worry about the hedge fund industry
p361
aVattracting too much of the world's great mathematical and other talent
p362
aVto work on that, as opposed to the many other problems in the world?
p363
aa(lp364
VJS: Well, it's not just mathematical.
p365
aVWe hire astronomers and physicists and things like that.
p366
aVI don't think we should worry about it too much.
p367
aVIt's still a pretty small industry.
p368
aVAnd in fact, bringing science into the investing world
p369
aVhas improved that world.
p370
aVIt's reduced volatility. It's increased liquidity.
p371
aVSpreads are narrower because people are trading that kind of stuff.
p372
aVSo I'm not too worried about Einstein going off and starting a hedge fund.
p373
aa(lp374
VCA: You're at a phase in your life now where you're actually investing, though,
p375
aVat the other end of the supply chain \u2014
p376
aVyou're actually boosting mathematics across America.
p377
aVThis is your wife, Marilyn.
p378
aVYou're working on philanthropic issues together.
p379
aVTell me about that.
p380
aa(lp381
VJS: Well, Marilyn started \u2014
p382
aVthere she is up there, my beautiful wife \u2014
p383
aVshe started the foundation about 20 years ago.
p384
aVI think '94.
p385
aVI claim it was '93, she says it was '94,
p386
aVbut it was one of those two years.
p387
aa(lp388
V(Laughter)
p389
aa(lp390
VWe started the foundation, just as a convenient way to give charity.
p391
aVShe kept the books, and so on.
p392
aVWe did not have a vision at that time, but gradually a vision emerged \u2014
p393
aVwhich was to focus on math and science, to focus on basic research.
p394
aVAnd that's what we've done.
p395
aVSix years ago or so, I left Renaissance and went to work at the foundation.
p396
aVSo that's what we do.
p397
aa(lp398
VCA: And so Math for America is basically investing
p399
aVin math teachers around the country,
p400
aVgiving them some extra income, giving them support and coaching.
p401
aVAnd really trying to make that more effective
p402
aVand make that a calling to which teachers can aspire.
p403
aa(lp404
VJS: Yeah \u2014 instead of beating up the bad teachers,
p405
aVwhich has created morale problems all through the educational community,
p406
aVin particular in math and science,
p407
aVwe focus on celebrating the good ones and giving them status.
p408
aVYeah, we give them extra money, 15,000 dollars a year.
p409
aVWe have 800 math and science teachers in New York City in public schools today,
p410
aVas part of a core.
p411
aVThere's a great morale among them.
p412
aVThey're staying in the field.
p413
aVNext year, it'll be 1,000 and that'll be 10 percent
p414
aVof the math and science teachers in New York [City] public schools.
p415
aa(lp416
V(Applause)
p417
aa(lp418
VCA: Jim, here's another project that you've supported philanthropically:
p419
aVResearch into origins of life, I guess.
p420
aVWhat are we looking at here?
p421
aVJS: Well, I'll save that for a second.
p422
aVAnd then I'll tell you what you're looking at.
p423
aVOrigins of life is a fascinating question.
p424
aVHow did we get here?
p425
aVWell, there are two questions:
p426
aVOne is, what is the route from geology to biology \u2014
p427
aVhow did we get here?
p428
aVAnd the other question is, what did we start with?
p429
aVWhat material, if any, did we have to work with on this route?
p430
aVThose are two very, very interesting questions.
p431
aVThe first question is a tortuous path from geology up to RNA
p432
aVor something like that \u2014 how did that all work?
p433
aVAnd the other, what do we have to work with?
p434
aVWell, more than we think.
p435
aVSo what's pictured there is a star in formation.
p436
aVNow, every year in our Milky Way, which has 100 billion stars,
p437
aVabout two new stars are created.
p438
aVDon't ask me how, but they're created.
p439
aVAnd it takes them about a million years to settle out.
p440
aVSo, in steady state,
p441
aVthere are about two million stars in formation at any time.
p442
aVThat one is somewhere along this settling-down period.
p443
aVAnd there's all this crap sort of circling around it,
p444
aVdust and stuff.
p445
aVAnd it'll form probably a solar system, or whatever it forms.
p446
aVBut here's the thing \u2014
p447
aVin this dust that surrounds a forming star
p448
aVhave been found, now, significant organic molecules.
p449
aVMolecules not just like methane, but formaldehyde and cyanide \u2014
p450
aVthings that are the building blocks \u2014 the seeds, if you will \u2014 of life.
p451
aVSo, that may be typical.
p452
aVAnd it may be typical that planets around the universe
p453
aVstart off with some of these basic building blocks.
p454
aVNow does that mean there's going to be life all around?
p455
aVMaybe.
p456
aVBut it's a question of how tortuous this path is
p457
aVfrom those frail beginnings, those seeds, all the way to life.
p458
aVAnd most of those seeds will fall on fallow planets.
p459
aa(lp460
VCA: So for you, personally,
p461
aVfinding an answer to this question of where we came from,
p462
aVof how did this thing happen, that is something you would love to see.
p463
aa(lp464
VJS: Would love to see.
p465
aVAnd like to know \u2014
p466
aVif that path is tortuous enough, and so improbable,
p467
aVthat no matter what you start with, we could be a singularity.
p468
aVBut on the other hand,
p469
aVgiven all this organic dust that's floating around,
p470
aVwe could have lots of friends out there.
p471
aVIt'd be great to know.

aa(lp473
VCA: Jim, a couple of years ago, I got the chance to speak with Elon Musk,
p474
aVand I asked him the secret of his success,
p475
aVand he said taking physics seriously was it.
p476
aVListening to you, what I hear you saying is taking math seriously,
p477
aVthat has infused your whole life.
p478
aVIt's made you an absolute fortune, and now it's allowing you to invest
p479
aVin the futures of thousands and thousands of kids across America and elsewhere.
p480
aVCould it be that science actually works?
p481
aVThat math actually works?
p482
aa(lp483
VJS: Well, math certainly works. Math certainly works.
p484
aVBut this has been fun.
p485
aVWorking with Marilyn and giving it away has been very enjoyable.
p486
aa(lp487
VCA: I just find it \u2014 it's an inspirational thought to me,
p488
aVthat by taking knowledge seriously, so much more can come from it.
p489
aVSo thank you for your amazing life, and for coming here to TED.
