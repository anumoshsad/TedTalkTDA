VI want to talk about the transformed media landscape,
p4
aVand what it means for anybody who has a message that they want to get out
p5
aVto anywhere in the world.
p6
aVAnd I want to illustrate that by telling a couple of stories
p7
aVabout that transformation.
p8
aa(lp9
VI'll start here. Last November there was a presidential election.
p10
aVYou probably read something about it in the papers.
p11
aVAnd there was some concern that in some parts of the country
p12
aVthere might be voter suppression.
p13
aVAnd so a plan came up to video the vote.
p14
aVAnd the idea was that individual citizens
p15
aVwith phones capable of taking photos or making video
p16
aVwould document their polling places,
p17
aVon the lookout for any kind of voter suppression techniques,
p18
aVand would upload this to a central place.
p19
aVAnd that this would operate as a kind of citizen observation \u2014
p20
aVthat citizens would not be there just to cast individual votes,
p21
aVbut also to help ensure the sanctity of the vote overall.
p22
aa(lp23
VSo this is a pattern that assumes we're all in this together.
p24
aVWhat matters here
p25
aVisn't technical capital,
p26
aVit's social capital.
p27
aVThese tools don't get socially interesting
p28
aVuntil they get technologically boring.
p29
aVIt isn't when the shiny new tools show up
p30
aVthat their uses start permeating society.
p31
aVIt's when everybody is able to take them for granted.
p32
aVBecause now that media is increasingly social,
p33
aVinnovation can happen anywhere
p34
aVthat people can take for granted the idea that we're all in this together.
p35
aa(lp36
VAnd so we're starting to see a media landscape
p37
aVin which innovation is happening everywhere,
p38
aVand moving from one spot to another.
p39
aVThat is a huge transformation.
p40
aVNot to put too fine a point on it, the moment we're living through \u2014
p41
aVthe moment our historical generation is living through \u2014
p42
aVis the largest increase in expressive capability
p43
aVin human history.
p44
aVNow that's a big claim. I'm going to try to back it up.
p45
aa(lp46
VThere are only four periods in the last 500 years
p47
aVwhere media has changed enough to qualify for the label "revolution."
p48
aVThe first one is the famous one, the printing press:
p49
aVmovable type, oil-based inks, that whole complex of innovations
p50
aVthat made printing possible
p51
aVand turned Europe upside-down, starting in the middle of the 1400s.
p52
aVThen, a couple of hundred years ago,
p53
aVthere was innovation in two-way communication,
p54
aVconversational media: first the telegraph, then the telephone.
p55
aVSlow, text-based conversations,
p56
aVthen real-time voice based conversations.
p57
aVThen, about 150 years ago,
p58
aVthere was a revolution in recorded media other than print:
p59
aVfirst photos, then recorded sound,
p60
aVthen movies, all encoded onto physical objects.
p61
aVAnd finally, about 100 years ago, the harnessing of electromagnetic spectrum
p62
aVto send sound and images through the air \u2014 radio and television.
p63
aVThis is the media landscape as we knew it in the 20th century.
p64
aVThis is what those of us of a certain age
p65
aVgrew up with, and are used to.
p66
aa(lp67
VBut there is a curious asymmetry here.
p68
aVThe media that is good at creating conversations
p69
aVis no good at creating groups.
p70
aVAnd the media that's good at creating groups
p71
aVis no good at creating conversations.
p72
aVIf you want to have a conversation
p73
aVin this world, you have it with one other person.
p74
aVIf you want to address a group, you get the same message
p75
aVand you give it to everybody in the group,
p76
aVwhether you're doing that with a broadcasting tower or a printing press.
p77
aVThat was the media landscape
p78
aVas we had it in the twentieth century.
p79
aa(lp80
VAnd this is what changed.
p81
aVThis thing that looks like a peacock hit a windscreen
p82
aVis Bill Cheswick's map of the Internet.
p83
aVHe traces the edges of the individual networks
p84
aVand then color codes them.
p85
aVThe Internet is the first medium in history
p86
aVthat has native support for groups
p87
aVand conversation at the same time.
p88
aVWhereas the phone gave us the one-to-one pattern,
p89
aVand television, radio, magazines, books,
p90
aVgave us the one-to-many pattern,
p91
aVthe Internet gives us the many-to-many pattern.
p92
aVFor the first time,
p93
aVmedia is natively good at supporting these kinds of conversations.
p94
aVThat's one of the big changes.
p95
aa(lp96
VThe second big change
p97
aVis that, as all media gets digitized,
p98
aVthe Internet also becomes the mode of carriage
p99
aVfor all other media,
p100
aVmeaning that phone calls migrate to the Internet,
p101
aVmagazines migrate to the Internet, movies migrate to the Internet.
p102
aVAnd that means that every medium
p103
aVis right next door to every other medium.
p104
aVPut another way,
p105
aVmedia is increasingly less just a source of information,
p106
aVand it is increasingly more a site of coordination,
p107
aVbecause groups that see or hear or watch or listen to something
p108
aVcan now gather around and talk to each other as well.
p109
aa(lp110
VAnd the third big change
p111
aVis that members of the former audience, as Dan Gilmore calls them,
p112
aVcan now also be producers and not consumers.
p113
aVEvery time a new consumer
p114
aVjoins this media landscape
p115
aVa new producer joins as well,
p116
aVbecause the same equipment \u2014
p117
aVphones, computers \u2014
p118
aVlet you consume and produce.
p119
aVIt's as if, when you bought a book, they threw in the printing press for free;
p120
aVit's like you had a phone that could turn into a radio
p121
aVif you pressed the right buttons.
p122
aVThat is a huge change
p123
aVin the media landscape we're used to.
p124
aVAnd it's not just Internet or no Internet.
p125
aVWe've had the Internet in its public form
p126
aVfor almost 20 years now,
p127
aVand it's still changing
p128
aVas the media becomes more social.
p129
aVIt's still changing patterns
p130
aVeven among groups who know how to deal with the Internet well.
p131
aa(lp132
VSecond story.
p133
aVLast May, China in the Sichuan province
p134
aVhad a terrible earthquake, 7.9 magnitude,
p135
aVmassive destruction in a wide area, as the Richter Scale has it.
p136
aVAnd the earthquake was reported as it was happening.
p137
aVPeople were texting from their phones. They were taking photos of buildings.
p138
aVThey were taking videos of buildings shaking.
p139
aVThey were uploading it to QQ, China's largest Internet service.
p140
aVThey were Twittering it.
p141
aVAnd so as the quake was happening
p142
aVthe news was reported.
p143
aVAnd because of the social connections,
p144
aVChinese students coming elsewhere, and going to school,
p145
aVor businesses in the rest of the world opening offices in China \u2014
p146
aVthere were people listening all over the world, hearing this news.
p147
aVThe BBC got their first wind of the Chinese quake from Twitter.
p148
aVTwitter announced the existence of the quake
p149
aVseveral minutes before the US Geological Survey
p150
aVhad anything up online for anybody to read.
p151
aVThe last time China had a quake of that magnitude
p152
aVit took them three months to admit that it had happened.
p153
aa(lp154
V(Laughter)
p155
aa(lp156
VNow they might have liked to have done that here,
p157
aVrather than seeing these pictures go up online.
p158
aVBut they weren't given that choice,
p159
aVbecause their own citizens beat them to the punch.
p160
aVEven the government learned of the earthquake from their own citizens,
p161
aVrather than from the Xinhua News Agency.
p162
aVAnd this stuff rippled like wildfire.
p163
aVFor a while there
p164
aVthe top 10 most clicked links on Twitter,
p165
aVthe global short messaging service \u2014
p166
aVnine of the top 10 links were about the quake.
p167
aVPeople collating information,
p168
aVpointing people to news sources,
p169
aVpointing people to the US geological survey.
p170
aVThe 10th one was kittens on a treadmill, but that's the Internet for you.
p171
aa(lp172
V(Laughter)
p173
aa(lp174
VBut nine of the 10 in those first hours.
p175
aVAnd within half a day donation sites were up,
p176
aVand donations were pouring in from all around the world.
p177
aVThis was an incredible, coordinated global response.
p178
aVAnd the Chinese then, in one of their periods of media openness,
p179
aVdecided that they were going to let it go,
p180
aVthat they were going to let this citizen reporting fly.
p181
aVAnd then this happened.
p182
aVPeople began to figure out, in the Sichuan Provence,
p183
aVthat the reason so many school buildings had collapsed \u2014
p184
aVbecause tragically the earthquake happened during a school day \u2014
p185
aVthe reason so many school buildings collapsed
p186
aVis that corrupt officials had taken bribes
p187
aVto allow those building to be built to less than code.
p188
aVAnd so they started, the citizen journalists started
p189
aa(lp190
Vreporting that as well. And there was an incredible picture.
p191
aVYou may have seen in on the front page of the New York Times.
p192
aVA local official literally prostrated himself in the street,
p193
aVin front of these protesters,
p194
aVin order to get them to go away.
p195
aVEssentially to say, "We will do anything to placate you,
p196
aVjust please stop protesting in public."
p197
aa(lp198
VBut these are people who have been radicalized,
p199
aVbecause, thanks to the one child policy,
p200
aVthey have lost everyone in their next generation.
p201
aVSomeone who has seen the death of a single child
p202
aVnow has nothing to lose.
p203
aVAnd so the protest kept going.
p204
aVAnd finally the Chinese cracked down.
p205
aVThat was enough of citizen media.
p206
aVAnd so they began to arrest the protesters.
p207
aVThey began to shut down the media that the protests were happening on.
p208
aa(lp209
VChina is probably the most successful
p210
aVmanager of Internet censorship in the world,
p211
aVusing something that is widely described as the Great Firewall of China.
p212
aVAnd the Great Firewall of China
p213
aVis a set of observation points
p214
aVthat assume that media is produced by professionals,
p215
aVit mostly comes in from the outside world,
p216
aVit comes in relatively sparse chunks,
p217
aVand it comes in relatively slowly.
p218
aVAnd because of those four characteristics
p219
aVthey are able to filter it as it comes into the country.
p220
aVBut like the Maginot Line,
p221
aVthe great firewall of China was facing in the wrong direction
p222
aVfor this challenge,
p223
aVbecause not one of those four things was true in this environment.
p224
aVThe media was produced locally. It was produced by amateurs.
p225
aVIt was produced quickly. And it was produced at such an incredible abundance
p226
aVthat there was no way to filter it as it appeared.
p227
aVAnd so now the Chinese government, who for a dozen years,
p228
aVhas quite successfully filtered the web,
p229
aVis now in the position of having to decide
p230
aVwhether to allow or shut down entire services,
p231
aVbecause the transformation to amateur media
p232
aVis so enormous that they can't deal with it any other way.
p233
aa(lp234
VAnd in fact that is happening this week.
p235
aVOn the 20th anniversary of Tiananmen
p236
aVthey just, two days ago, announced
p237
aVthat they were simply shutting down access to Twitter,
p238
aVbecause there was no way to filter it other than that.
p239
aVThey had to turn the spigot entirely off.
p240
aVNow these changes don't just affect people who want to censor messages.
p241
aVThey also affect people who want to send messages,
p242
aa(lp243
Vbecause this is really a transformation of the ecosystem as a whole,
p244
aVnot just a particular strategy.
p245
aVThe classic media problem, from the 20th century
p246
aVis, how does an organization have a message
p247
aVthat they want to get out
p248
aVto a group of people distributed at the edges of a network.
p249
aVAnd here is the twentieth century answer.
p250
aVBundle up the message. Send the same message to everybody.
p251
aVNational message. Targeted individuals.
p252
aVRelatively sparse number of producers.
p253
aVVery expensive to do,
p254
aVso there is not a lot of competition.
p255
aVThis is how you reach people.
p256
aVAll of that is over.
p257
aa(lp258
VWe are increasingly in a landscape where media is global,
p259
aVsocial, ubiquitous and cheap.
p260
aVNow most organizations that are trying to send messages
p261
aVto the outside world, to the distributed collection of the audience,
p262
aVare now used to this change.
p263
aVThe audience can talk back.
p264
aVAnd that's a little freaky. But you can get used to it after a while, as people do.
p265
aa(lp266
VBut that's not the really crazy change that we're living in the middle of.
p267
aVThe really crazy change is here:
p268
aVit's the fact that they are no longer disconnected from each other,
p269
aVthe fact that former consumers are now producers,
p270
aVthe fact that the audience can talk directly to one another;
p271
aVbecause there is a lot more amateurs than professionals,
p272
aVand because the size of the network,
p273
aVthe complexity of the network is actually the square
p274
aVof the number of participants,
p275
aVmeaning that the network, when it grows large,
p276
aVgrows very, very large.
p277
aa(lp278
VAs recently at last decade,
p279
aVmost of the media that was available for public consumption
p280
aVwas produced by professionals.
p281
aVThose days are over, never to return.
p282
aVIt is the green lines now, that are the source of the free content,
p283
aVwhich brings me to my last story.
p284
aVWe saw some of the most imaginative use
p285
aVof social media during the Obama campaign.
p286
aa(lp287
VAnd I don't mean most imaginative use in politics \u2014
p288
aVI mean most imaginative use ever.
p289
aVAnd one of the things Obama did, was they famously,
p290
aVthe Obama campaign did, was they famously put up
p291
aVMyBarackObama.com, myBO.com
p292
aVAnd millions of citizens rushed in to participate,
p293
aVand to try and figure out how to help.
p294
aVAn incredible conversation sprung up there.
p295
aVAnd then, this time last year,
p296
aVObama announced that he was going to change his vote on FISA,
p297
aVThe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.
p298
aVHe had said, in January, that he would not sign a bill
p299
aVthat granted telecom immunity for possibly warrantless spying
p300
aVon American persons.
p301
aVBy the summer, in the middle of the general campaign,
p302
aVHe said, "I've thought about the issue more. I've changed my mind.
p303
aVI'm going to vote for this bill."
p304
aVAnd many of his own supporters
p305
aVon his own site went very publicly berserk.
p306
aa(lp307
VIt was Senator Obama when they created it. They changed the name later.
p308
aV"Please get FISA right."
p309
aVWithin days of this group being created
p310
aVit was the fastest growing group on myBO.com;
p311
aVwithin weeks of its being created it was the largest group.
p312
aVObama had to issue a press release.
p313
aVHe had to issue a reply.
p314
aVAnd he said essentially, "I have considered the issue.
p315
aVI understand where you are coming from.
p316
aVBut having considered it all, I'm still going to vote the way I'm going to vote.
p317
aVBut I wanted to reach out to you and say, I understand that you disagree with me,
p318
aVand I'm going to take my lumps on this one."
p319
aa(lp320
VThis didn't please anybody. But then a funny thing happened in the conversation.
p321
aVPeople in that group realized
p322
aVthat Obama had never shut them down.
p323
aVNobody in the Obama campaign had ever tried to hide the group
p324
aVor make it harder to join,
p325
aVto deny its existence, to delete it,
p326
aVto take to off the site.
p327
aVThey had understood that their role
p328
aVwith myBO.com was to convene their supporters
p329
aVbut not to control their supporters.
p330
aa(lp331
VAnd that is the kind of discipline
p332
aVthat it takes to make really mature use
p333
aVof this media.
p334
aVMedia, the media landscape that we knew,
p335
aVas familiar as it was, as easy conceptually as it was
p336
aVto deal with the idea that professionals broadcast
p337
aVmessages to amateurs,
p338
aVis increasingly slipping away.
p339
aVIn a world where media is global, social, ubiquitous and cheap,
p340
aVin a world of media where the former audience
p341
aVare now increasingly full participants,
p342
aVin that world, media is less and less often
p343
aVabout crafting a single message
p344
aVto be consumed by individuals.
p345
aVIt is more and more often
p346
aVa way of creating an environment for convening
p347
aVand supporting groups.
p348
aa(lp349
VAnd the choice we face,
p350
aVI mean anybody who has a message they want to have heard
p351
aVanywhere in the world,
p352
aVisn't whether or not that is the media environment we want to operate in.
p353
aVThat's the media environment we've got.
p354
aVThe question we all face now is,
p355
aV"How can we make best use of this media?
p356
aVEven though it means changing the way we've always done it."
p357
aVThank you very much.
