VBy 2010, Detroit had become the poster child
p4
aVfor an American city in crisis.
p5
aVThere was a housing collapse,
p6
aVan auto industry collapse,
p7
aVand the population had plummeted by 25 percent
p8
aVbetween 2000 and 2010,
p9
aVand many people were beginning to write it off,
p10
aVas it had topped the list of American shrinking cities.
p11
aVBy 2010, I had also been asked by
p12
aVthe Kresge Foundation and the city of Detroit
p13
aVto join them in leading a citywide planning process
p14
aVfor the city to create a shared vision for its future.
p15
aVI come to this work
p16
aVas an architect and an urban planner,
p17
aVand I've spent my career working in other contested cities,
p18
aVlike Chicago, my hometown;
p19
aVHarlem, which is my current home;
p20
aVWashington, D.C.; and Newark, New Jersey.
p21
aVAll of these cities, to me, still had a number
p22
aVof unresolved issues related to urban justice,
p23
aVissues of equity, inclusion and access.
p24
aa(lp25
VNow by 2010, as well,
p26
aVpopular design magazines were also beginning
p27
aVto take a closer look at cities like Detroit,
p28
aVand devoting whole issues to "fixing the city."
p29
aVI was asked by a good friend, Fred Bernstein,
p30
aVto do an interview for the October issue
p31
aVof Architect magazine,
p32
aVand he and I kind of had a good chuckle
p33
aVwhen we saw the magazine released with the title,
p34
aV"Can This Planner Save Detroit?"
p35
aVSo I'm smiling with a little bit of embarrassment right now,
p36
aVbecause obviously, it's completely absurd
p37
aVthat a single person, let alone a planner,
p38
aVcould save a city.
p39
aVBut I'm also smiling because I thought it represented
p40
aVa sense of hopefulness that our profession
p41
aVcould play a role in helping the city to think about
p42
aVhow it would recover from its severe crisis.
p43
aVSo I'd like to spend a little bit of time this afternoon
p44
aVand tell you a little bit about our process
p45
aVfor fixing the city, a little bit about Detroit,
p46
aVand I want to do that through the voices of Detroiters.
p47
aa(lp48
VSo we began our process in September of 2010.
p49
aVIt's just after a special mayoral election,
p50
aVand word has gotten out that there is going to be
p51
aVthis citywide planning process,
p52
aVwhich brings a lot of anxiety and fears
p53
aVamong Detroiters.
p54
aVWe had planned to hold a number of community meetings in rooms like this
p55
aVto introduce the planning process,
p56
aVand people came out from all over the city,
p57
aVincluding areas that were stable neighborhoods,
p58
aVas well as areas that were beginning to see
p59
aVa lot of vacancy.
p60
aVAnd most of our audience was representative
p61
aVof the 82 percent African-American population
p62
aVin the city at that time.
p63
aVSo obviously, we have a Q&A portion of our program,
p64
aVand people line up to mics to ask questions.
p65
aVMany of them step very firmly to the mic,
p66
aVput their hands across their chest, and go,
p67
aV"I know you people are trying to move me out of my house, right?"
p68
aa(lp69
VSo that question is really powerful,
p70
aVand it was certainly powerful to us in the moment,
p71
aVwhen you connect it to the stories
p72
aVthat some Detroiters had,
p73
aVand actually a lot of African-Americans'
p74
aVfamilies have had
p75
aVthat are living in Midwestern cities like Detroit.
p76
aVMany of them told us the stories about
p77
aVhow they came to own their home
p78
aVthrough their grandparents or great-grandparents,
p79
aVwho were one of 1.6 million people who migrated
p80
aVfrom the rural South to the industrial North,
p81
aVas depicted in this painting by Jacob Lawrence,
p82
aV"The Great Migration."
p83
aVThey came to Detroit for a better way of life.
p84
aVMany found work in the automobile industry,
p85
aVthe Ford Motor Company, as depicted in this mural
p86
aVby Diego Rivera in the Detroit Institute of Art.
p87
aVThe fruits of their labors would afford them a home,
p88
aVfor many the first piece of property that they would ever know,
p89
aVand a community with other first-time
p90
aVAfrican-American home buyers.
p91
aVThe first couple of decades of their life in the North
p92
aVis quite well, up until about 1950,
p93
aVwhich coincides with the city's peak population
p94
aVat 1.8 million people.
p95
aVNow it's at this time that Detroit begins to see
p96
aVa second kind of migration,
p97
aVa migration to the suburbs.
p98
aVBetween 1950 and 2000,
p99
aVthe region grows by 30 percent.
p100
aVBut this time, the migration leaves
p101
aVAfrican-Americans in place,
p102
aVas families and businesses flee the city,
p103
aVleaving the city pretty desolate of people
p104
aVas well as jobs.
p105
aVDuring that same period, between 1950 and 2000, 2010,
p106
aVthe city loses 60 percent of its population,
p107
aVand today it hovers at above 700,000.
p108
aa(lp109
VThe audience members who come and talk to us that night
p110
aVtell us the stories of what it's like to live in a city
p111
aVwith such depleted population.
p112
aVMany tell us that they're one of only a few homes
p113
aVon their block that are occupied,
p114
aVand that they can see several abandoned homes
p115
aVfrom where they sit on their porches.
p116
aVCitywide, there are 80,000 vacant homes.
p117
aVThey can also see vacant property.
p118
aVThey're beginning to see illegal activities
p119
aVon these properties, like illegal dumping,
p120
aVand they know that because the city has lost so much population,
p121
aVtheir costs for water, electricity, gas are rising,
p122
aVbecause there are not enough people to pay property taxes
p123
aVto help support the services that they need.
p124
aVCitywide, there are about 100,000 vacant parcels.
p125
aa(lp126
VNow, to quickly give you all a sense of a scale,
p127
aVbecause I know that sounds like a big number,
p128
aVbut I don't think you quite understand until you look at the city map.
p129
aVSo the city is 139 square miles.
p130
aVYou can fit Boston, San Francisco,
p131
aVand the island of Manhattan
p132
aVwithin its footprint.
p133
aVSo if we take all of that vacant and abandoned property
p134
aVand we smush it together,
p135
aVit looks like about 20 square miles,
p136
aVand that's roughly equivalent to the size
p137
aVof the island we're sitting on today, Manhattan,
p138
aVat 22 square miles.
p139
aVSo it's a lot of vacancy.
p140
aa(lp141
VNow some of our audience members
p142
aValso tell us about some of the positive things
p143
aVthat are happening in their communities,
p144
aVand many of them are banding together
p145
aVto take control of some of the vacant lots,
p146
aVand they're starting community gardens,
p147
aVwhich are creating a great sense of community stewardship,
p148
aVbut they're very, very clear to tell us
p149
aVthat this is not enough,
p150
aVthat they want to see their neighborhoods
p151
aVreturn to the way that their grandparents had found them.
p152
aa(lp153
VNow there's been a lot of speculation since 2010
p154
aVabout what to do with the vacant property,
p155
aVand a lot of that speculation has been around community gardening,
p156
aVor what we call urban agriculture.
p157
aVSo many people would say to us,
p158
aV"What if you just take all that vacant land and you could make it farmland?
p159
aVIt can provide fresh foods,
p160
aVand it can put Detroiters back to work too."
p161
aVWhen I hear that story,
p162
aVI always imagine the folks from the Great Migration
p163
aVrolling over in their graves,
p164
aVbecause you can imagine that they didn't sacrifice
p165
aVmoving from the South to the North
p166
aVto create a better life for their families,
p167
aVonly to see their great-grandchildren return to an agrarian lifestyle,
p168
aVespecially in a city where they came
p169
aVwith little less than a high school education
p170
aVor even a grammar school education
p171
aVand were able to afford the basic elements
p172
aVof the American dream:
p173
aVsteady work and a home that they owned.
p174
aa(lp175
VNow, there's a third wave of migration
p176
aVhappening in Detroit:
p177
aVa new ascendant of cultural entrepreneurs.
p178
aVThese folks see that same vacant land
p179
aVand those same abandoned homes
p180
aVas opportunity for new,
p181
aVentrepreneurial ideas and profit,
p182
aVso much so that former models
p183
aVcan move to Detroit,
p184
aVbuy property, start successful
p185
aVbusinesses and restaurants,
p186
aVand become successful community activists in their neighborhood,
p187
aVbringing about very positive change.
p188
aVSimilarly, we have small manufacturing companies
p189
aVmaking conscious decisions to relocate to the city.
p190
aVThis company, Shinola, which is a luxury watch
p191
aVand bicycle company,
p192
aVdeliberately chose to relocate to Detroit,
p193
aVand they quote themselves by saying
p194
aVthey were drawn to the global brand  of Detroit's innovation.
p195
aVAnd they also knew that  they can tap into a workforce
p196
aVthat was still very skilled in how to make things.
p197
aVNow we have community stewardship
p198
aVhappening in neighborhoods,
p199
aVwe have cultural entrepreneurs making decisions
p200
aVto move to the city and create enterprises,
p201
aVand we have businesses relocating,
p202
aVand this is all in the context
p203
aVof what is no secret to us all,
p204
aVa city that's under the control
p205
aVof an emergency manager,
p206
aVand just this July filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy.
p207
aa(lp208
VSo 2010, we started this process, and by 2013,
p209
aVwe released Detroit Future City,
p210
aVwhich was our strategic plan to guide the city
p211
aVinto a better and more prosperous
p212
aVand more sustainable existence \u2014
p213
aVnot what it was, but what it could be,
p214
aVlooking at new ways of economic growth,
p215
aVnew forms of land use,
p216
aVmore sustainable and denser neighborhoods,
p217
aVa reconfigured infrastructure and city service system,
p218
aVand a heightened capacity for civic leaders
p219
aVto take action and implement change.
p220
aVThree key imperatives were really important
p221
aVto our work.
p222
aVOne was that the city itself wasn't necessarily too large,
p223
aVbut the economy was too small.
p224
aVThere are only 27 jobs per 100 people in Detroit,
p225
aVvery different from a Denver or an Atlanta or a Philadelphia
p226
aVthat are anywhere between  35 to 70 jobs per 100 people.
p227
aVSecondly, there had to be an acceptance
p228
aVthat we were not going to be able to use
p229
aVall of this vacant land in the way that we had before
p230
aVand maybe for some time to come.
p231
aVIt wasn't going to be our traditional residential neighborhoods
p232
aVas we had before,
p233
aVand urban agriculture, while a very productive
p234
aVand successful intervention happening in Detroit,
p235
aVwas not the only answer,
p236
aVthat what we had to do is look at these areas
p237
aVwhere we had significant vacancy
p238
aVbut still had a significant number of population
p239
aVof what could be new, productive, innovative,
p240
aVand entrepreneurial uses
p241
aVthat could stabilize those communities,
p242
aVwhere still nearly 300,000 residents lived.
p243
aa(lp244
VSo we came up with one neighborhood typology \u2014
p245
aVthere are several \u2014 called a live-make neighborhood,
p246
aVwhere folks could reappropriate
p247
aVabandoned structures
p248
aVand turn them into entrepreneurial enterprises,
p249
aVwith a specific emphasis on looking at the, again,
p250
aVmajority 82 percent African-American population.
p251
aVSo they, too, could take businesses
p252
aVthat they maybe were doing out of their home
p253
aVand grow them to more prosperous industries
p254
aVand actually acquire property so they were actually
p255
aVproperty owners as well as business owners
p256
aVin the communities with which they resided.
p257
aVThen we also wanted to look at other ways
p258
aVof using land in addition to growing food
p259
aVand transforming landscape into
p260
aVmuch more productive uses,
p261
aVso that it could be used for storm water management, for example,
p262
aVby using surface lakes and retention ponds,
p263
aVthat created neighborhood amenities,
p264
aVplaces of recreation,
p265
aVand actually helped to elevate
p266
aVadjacent property levels.
p267
aVOr we could use it as research plots,
p268
aVwhere we can use it to remediate contaminated soils,
p269
aVor we could use it to generate energy.
p270
aa(lp271
VSo the descendants of the Great Migration
p272
aVcould either become precision watchmakers at Shinola,
p273
aVlike Willie H., who was featured in one of their ads last year,
p274
aVor they can actually grow a business
p275
aVthat would service companies like Shinola.
p276
aVThe good news is, there is a future
p277
aVfor the next generation of Detroiters,
p278
aVboth those there now and those that want to come.
p279
aa(lp280
VSo no thank you, Mayor Menino,
p281
aVwho recently was quoted as saying,
p282
aV"I'd blow up the place and start over."
p283
aVThere are very important people,
p284
aVbusiness and land assets in Detroit,
p285
aVand there are real opportunities there.
p286
aVSo while Detroit might not be what it was,
p287
aVDetroit will not die.
p288
aa(lp289
VThank you.
