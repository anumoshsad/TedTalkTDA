VSo, about three years ago I was in London,
p4
aVand somebody called Howard Burton came to me and said,
p5
aVI represent a group of people,
p6
aVand we want to start an institute in theoretical physics.
p7
aVWe have about 120 million dollars, and we want to do it well.
p8
aVWe want to be in the forefront fields,
p9
aVand we want to do it differently.
p10
aVWe want to get out of this thing
p11
aVwhere the young people have all the ideas, and the old people have all the power
p12
aVand decide what science gets done.
p13
aVIt took me about 25 seconds to decide that that was a good idea.
p14
aa(lp15
VThree years later, we have the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics
p16
aVin Waterloo, Ontario. It\u2019s the most exciting job I\u2019ve ever had.
p17
aVAnd it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve had a job where I\u2019m afraid to go away
p18
aVbecause of everything that\u2019s going to happen in this week when I\u2019m here.
p19
aV(Laughter)
p20
aVBut in any case, what I\u2019m going to do in my little bit of time
p21
aVis take you on a quick tour of some of the things
p22
aVthat we talk about and we think about.
p23
aVSo, we think a lot about what really makes science work?
p24
aVThe first thing that anybody who knows science,
p25
aVand has been around science,
p26
aVis that the stuff you learn in school as a scientific method
p27
aVis wrong. There is no method.
p28
aVOn the other hand, somehow we manage to reason together
p29
aVas a community, from incomplete evidence
p30
aVto conclusions that we all agree about.
p31
aVAnd this is, by the way, something that a democratic society also has to do.
p32
aa(lp33
VSo how does it work?
p34
aVWell, my belief is that it works
p35
aVbecause scientists are a community bound together by an ethics.
p36
aVAnd here are some of the ethical principles.
p37
aVI\u2019m not going to read them all to you because I\u2019m not in teacher mode.
p38
aVI\u2019m in entertain, amaze mode.
p39
aV(Laughter)
p40
aa(lp41
VBut one of the principles is that everybody
p42
aVwho is part of the community gets to fight and argue
p43
aVas hard as they can for what they believe.
p44
aVBut we\u2019re all disciplined by the understanding
p45
aVthat the only people who are going to decide, you know,
p46
aVwhether I\u2019m right or somebody else is right,
p47
aVare the people in our community in the next generation,
p48
aVin 30 and 50 years.
p49
aVSo it\u2019s this combination of respect
p50
aVfor the tradition and community we\u2019re in,
p51
aVand rebellion that the community requires to get anywhere,
p52
aVthat makes science work.
p53
aVAnd being in this process of being in a community
p54
aVthat reasons from shared evidence to conclusions,
p55
aVI believe, teaches us about democracy.
p56
aVNot only is there a relationship between the ethics of science
p57
aVand the ethics of being a citizen in democracy,
p58
aVbut there has been, historically, a relationship
p59
aVbetween how people think about space and time, and what the cosmos is,
p60
aVand how people think about the society that they live in.
p61
aa(lp62
VAnd I want to talk about three stages in that evolution.
p63
aVThe first science of cosmology that was anything like science
p64
aVwas Aristotelian science, and that was hierarchical.
p65
aVThe earth is in the center, then there are these crystal spheres,
p66
aVthe sun, the moon, the planets and finally the celestial sphere,
p67
aVwhere the stars are. And everything in this universe has a place.
p68
aVAnd Aristotle\u2019s law of motion was that everything
p69
aVgoes to its natural place, which was of course,
p70
aVthe rule of the society that Aristotle lived in,
p71
aVand more importantly, the medieval society that, through Christianity,
p72
aVembraced Aristotle and blessed it.
p73
aVAnd the idea is that everything is defined.
p74
aVWhere something is, is defined with respect to this last sphere,
p75
aVthe celestial sphere, outside of which is this eternal,
p76
aVperfect realm, where lives God,
p77
aVwho is the ultimate judge of everything.
p78
aa(lp79
VSo that is both Aristotelian cosmology,
p80
aVand in a certain sense, medieval society.
p81
aVNow, in the 17th century there was a revolution in thinking about
p82
aVspace and time and motion and so forth of Newton.
p83
aVAnd at the same time there was a revolution in social thought
p84
aVof John Locke and his collaborators.
p85
aVAnd they were very closely associated.
p86
aVIn fact, Newton and Locke were friends.
p87
aVTheir way of thinking about space and time and motion on the one hand,
p88
aVand a society on the other hand, were closely related.
p89
aa(lp90
VAnd let me show you.
p91
aVIn a Newtonian universe, there\u2019s no center \u2014 thank you.
p92
aVThere are particles and they move around
p93
aVwith respect to a fixed, absolute framework of space and time.
p94
aVIt\u2019s meaningful to say absolutely where something is in space,
p95
aVbecause that\u2019s defined, not with respect to say, where other things are,
p96
aVbut with respect to this absolute notion of space,
p97
aVwhich for Newton was God.
p98
aa(lp99
VNow, similarly, in Locke\u2019s society there are individuals
p100
aVwho have certain rights, properties in a formal sense,
p101
aVand those are defined with respect to some absolute,
p102
aVabstract notions of rights and justice, and so forth,
p103
aVwhich are independent of what else has happened in the society.
p104
aVOf who else there is, of the history and so forth.
p105
aVThere is also an omniscient observer
p106
aVwho knows everything, who is God,
p107
aVwho is in a certain sense outside the universe,
p108
aVbecause he has no role in anything that happens,
p109
aVbut is in a certain sense everywhere,
p110
aVbecause space is just the way that God knows
p111
aVwhere everything is, according to Newton, OK?
p112
aa(lp113
VSo this is the foundations of what\u2019s called, traditionally,
p114
aVliberal political theory and Newtonian physics.
p115
aVNow, in the 20th century we had a revolution
p116
aVthat was initiated at the beginning of the 20th century,
p117
aVand which is still going on.
p118
aVIt was begun with the invention
p119
aVof relativity theory and quantum theory.
p120
aVAnd merging them together to make the final quantum theory
p121
aVof space and time and gravity, is the culmination of that,
p122
aVsomething that\u2019s going on right now.
p123
aVAnd in this universe there\u2019s nothing fixed and absolute. Zilch, OK.
p124
aVThis universe is described by being a network of relationships.
p125
aa(lp126
VSpace is just one aspect, so there\u2019s no meaning to say
p127
aVabsolutely where something is.
p128
aVThere\u2019s only where it is relative to everything else that is.
p129
aVAnd this network of relations is ever-evolving.
p130
aVSo we call it a relational universe.
p131
aVAll properties of things are about these kinds of relationships.
p132
aVAnd also, if you\u2019re embedded in such a network of relationships,
p133
aVyour view of the world has to do with what information
p134
aVcomes to you through the network of relations.
p135
aVAnd there\u2019s no place for an omniscient observer
p136
aVor an outside intelligence knowing everything and making everything.
p137
aVSo this is general relativity, this is quantum theory.
p138
aVThis is also, if you talk to legal scholars,
p139
aVthe foundations of new ideas in legal thought.
p140
aVThey\u2019re thinking about the same things.
p141
aVAnd not only that, they make the analogy
p142
aVto relativity theory and cosmology often.
p143
aVSo there\u2019s an interesting discussion going on there.
p144
aVThis last view of cosmology is called the relational view.
p145
aa(lp146
VSo the main slogan here is that there\u2019s nothing outside the universe,
p147
aVwhich means that there\u2019s no place
p148
aVto put an explanation for something outside.
p149
aVSo in such a relational universe,
p150
aVif you come upon something that\u2019s ordered and structured,
p151
aVlike this device here, or that device there,
p152
aVor something beautiful, like all the living things,
p153
aVall of you guys in the room \u2014
p154
aV"guys" in physics, by the way, is a generic term: men and women.
p155
aV(Laughter)
p156
aa(lp157
VThen you want to know, you\u2019re a person,
p158
aVyou want to know how is it made.
p159
aVAnd in a relational universe the only possible explanation was, somehow it made itself.
p160
aVThere must be mechanisms of self-organization
p161
aVinside the universe that make things.
p162
aVBecause there\u2019s no place to put a maker outside,
p163
aVas there was in the Aristotelian and the Newtonian universe.
p164
aVSo in a relational universe we must have processes of self-organization.
p165
aa(lp166
VNow, Darwin taught us that there are processes of self-organization
p167
aVthat suffice to explain all of us and everything we see.
p168
aVSo it works. But not only that,
p169
aVif you think about how natural selection works,
p170
aVthen it turns out that natural selection
p171
aVwould only make sense in such a relational universe.
p172
aVThat is, natural selection works on properties,
p173
aVlike fitness, which are about relationships
p174
aVof some species to some other species.
p175
aVDarwin wouldn\u2019t make sense in an Aristotelian universe,
p176
aVand wouldn\u2019t really make sense in a Newtonian universe.
p177
aa(lp178
VSo a theory of biology based on natural selection
p179
aVrequires a relational notion of
p180
aVwhat are the properties of biological systems.
p181
aVAnd if you push that all the way down, really,
p182
aVit makes the best sense in a relational universe
p183
aVwhere all properties are relational.
p184
aVNow, not only that, but Einstein taught us
p185
aVthat gravity is the result of the world being relational.
p186
aVIf it wasn\u2019t for gravity, there wouldn\u2019t be life,
p187
aVbecause gravity causes stars to form and live for a very long time,
p188
aVkeeping pieces of the world, like the surface of the Earth,
p189
aVout of thermal equilibrium for billions of years so life can evolve.
p190
aa(lp191
VIn the 20th century,
p192
aVwe saw the independent development of two big themes in science.
p193
aVIn the biological sciences, they explored
p194
aVthe implications of the notion that order and complexity
p195
aVand structure arise in a self-organized way.
p196
aVThat was the triumph of Neo-Darwinism and so forth.
p197
aVAnd slowly, that idea is leaking out to the cognitive sciences,
p198
aVthe human sciences, economics, et cetera.
p199
aVAt the same time, we physicists
p200
aVhave been busy trying to make sense of
p201
aVand build on and integrate the discoveries
p202
aVof quantum theory and relativity.
p203
aa(lp204
VAnd what we\u2019ve been working out is the implications, really,
p205
aVof the idea that the universe is made up of relations.
p206
aV21st-century science is going to be driven
p207
aVby the integration of these two ideas:
p208
aVthe triumph of relational ways of thinking
p209
aVabout the world, on the one hand,
p210
aVand self-organization or Darwinian ways of thinking about the world,
p211
aVon the other hand.
p212
aVAnd also, is that in the 21st century
p213
aVour thinking about space and time and cosmology,
p214
aVand our thinking about society are both going to continue to evolve.
p215
aVAnd what they\u2019re evolving towards is the union
p216
aVof these two big ideas, Darwinism and relationalism.
p217
aa(lp218
VNow, if you think about democracy from this perspective,
p219
aVa new pluralistic notion of democracy would be one that recognizes
p220
aVthat there are many different interests, many different agendas,
p221
aVmany different individuals, many different points of view.
p222
aVEach one is incomplete, because you\u2019re embedded
p223
aVin a network of relationships.
p224
aVAny actor in a democracy is embedded
p225
aVin a network of relationships.
p226
aVAnd you understand some things better than other things,
p227
aVand because of that there\u2019s a continual jostling
p228
aVand give and take, which is politics.
p229
aVAnd politics is, in the ideal sense,
p230
aVthe way in which we continually address
p231
aVour network of relations in order to achieve
p232
aVa better life and a better society.
p233
aa(lp234
VAnd I also think that science will never go away and \u2014
p235
aVI\u2019m finishing on this line.
p236
aV(Laughter)
p237
aVIn fact, I\u2019m finished. Science will never go away.
