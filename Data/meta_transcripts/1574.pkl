VAs it turns out, when tens of millions of people are unemployed
p4
aVor underemployed,
p5
aVthere's a fair amount of interest in what technology might be doing
p6
aVto the labor force.
p7
aVAnd as I look at the conversation,
p8
aVit strikes me that it's focused on exactly the right topic,
p9
aVand at the same time, it's missing the point entirely.
p10
aVThe topic that it's focused on,
p11
aVthe question is whether or not all these digital technologies are affecting
p12
aVpeople's ability to earn a living,
p13
aVor, to say it a little bit different way,
p14
aVare the droids taking our jobs?
p15
aVAnd there's some evidence that they are.
p16
aa(lp17
VThe Great Recession ended when American GDP resumed
p18
aVits kind of slow, steady march upward,
p19
aVand some other economic indicators also started to rebound,
p20
aVand they got kind of healthy kind of quickly.
p21
aVCorporate profits are quite high;
p22
aVin fact, if you include bank profits,
p23
aVthey're higher than they've ever been.
p24
aVAnd business investment in gear \u2014 in equipment
p25
aVand hardware and software \u2014 is at an all-time high.
p26
aVSo the businesses are getting out their checkbooks.
p27
aVWhat they're not really doing is hiring.
p28
aVSo this red line
p29
aVis the employment-to-population ratio,
p30
aVin other words, the percentage of working-age people in America
p31
aVwho have work.
p32
aVAnd we see that it cratered during the Great Recession,
p33
aVand it hasn't started to bounce back at all.
p34
aa(lp35
VBut the story is not just a recession story.
p36
aVThe decade that we've just been through had
p37
aVrelatively anemic job growth all throughout,
p38
aVespecially when we compare it to other decades,
p39
aVand the 2000s are the only time we have on record
p40
aVwhere there were fewer people working at the end of the decade
p41
aVthan at the beginning.
p42
aVThis is not what you want to see.
p43
aVWhen you graph the number of potential employees
p44
aVversus the number of jobs in the country,
p45
aVyou see the gap gets bigger and bigger over time,
p46
aVand then, during the Great Recession, it opened up in a huge way.
p47
aa(lp48
VI did some quick calculations.
p49
aVI took the last 20 years of GDP growth
p50
aVand the last 20 years of labor-productivity growth
p51
aVand used those in a fairly straightforward way
p52
aVto try to project how many jobs the economy was going to need
p53
aVto keep growing,
p54
aVand this is the line that I came up with.
p55
aVIs that good or bad?
p56
aVThis is the government's projection
p57
aVfor the working-age population going forward.
p58
aVSo if these predictions are accurate, that gap is not going to close.
p59
aa(lp60
VThe problem is, I don't think these projections are accurate.
p61
aVIn particular, I think my projection is way too optimistic,
p62
aVbecause when I did it,
p63
aVI was assuming that the future was kind of going to look like the past,
p64
aVwith labor productivity growth,
p65
aVand that's actually not what I believe.
p66
aVBecause when I look around,
p67
aVI think that we ain't seen nothing yet
p68
aVwhen it comes to technology's impact on the labor force.
p69
aa(lp70
VJust in the past couple years, we've seen digital tools
p71
aVdisplay skills and abilities that they never, ever had before,
p72
aVand that kind of eat deeply into what we human beings
p73
aVdo for a living.
p74
aVLet me give you a couple examples.
p75
aa(lp76
VThroughout all of history,
p77
aVif you wanted something translated from one language into another,
p78
aVyou had to involve a human being.
p79
aVNow we have multi-language, instantaneous,
p80
aVautomatic translation services available for free
p81
aVvia many of our devices, all the way down to smartphones.
p82
aVAnd if any of us have used these,
p83
aVwe know that they're not perfect, but they're decent.
p84
aa(lp85
VThroughout all of history, if you wanted something written,
p86
aVa report or an article, you had to involve a person.
p87
aVNot anymore.
p88
aVThis is an article that appeared in Forbes online a while back,
p89
aVabout Apple's earnings.
p90
aVIt was written by an algorithm.
p91
aVAnd it's not decent \u2014 it's perfect.
p92
aa(lp93
VA lot of people look at this and they say,
p94
aV"OK, but those are very specific, narrow tasks,
p95
aVand most knowledge workers are actually generalists.
p96
aVAnd what they do is sit on top of a very large body of expertise and knowledge
p97
aVand they use that to react on the fly to kind of unpredictable demands,
p98
aVand that's very, very hard to automate."
p99
aVOne of the most impressive knowledge workers in recent memory
p100
aVis a guy named Ken Jennings.
p101
aVHe won the quiz show "Jeopardy!" 74 times in a row.
p102
aVTook home three million dollars.
p103
aVThat's Ken on the right, getting beat three-to-one
p104
aVby Watson, the Jeopardy-playing supercomputer from IBM.
p105
aVSo when we look at what technology can do to general knowledge workers,
p106
aVI start to think there might not be something so special
p107
aVabout this idea of a generalist,
p108
aVparticularly when we start doing things like hooking Siri up to Watson,
p109
aVand having technologies that can understand what we're saying
p110
aVand repeat speech back to us.
p111
aa(lp112
VNow, Siri is far from perfect, and we can make fun of her flaws,
p113
aVbut we should also keep in mind
p114
aVthat if technologies like Siri and Watson improve along a Moore's law trajectory,
p115
aVwhich they will,
p116
aVin six years, they're not going to be two times better or four times better,
p117
aVthey'll be 16 times better than they are right now.
p118
aVSo I start to think a lot of knowledge work is going to be affected by this.
p119
aa(lp120
VAnd digital technologies are not just impacting knowledge work,
p121
aVthey're starting to flex their muscles in the physical world as well.
p122
aVI had the chance a little while back to ride in the Google autonomous car,
p123
aVwhich is as cool as it sounds.
p124
aa(lp125
V(Laughter)
p126
aa(lp127
VAnd I will vouch that it handled the stop-and-go traffic on US 101
p128
aVvery smoothly.
p129
aVThere are about three and a half million people who drive trucks for a living
p130
aVin the United States;
p131
aVI think some of them are going to be affected by this technology.
p132
aVAnd right now, humanoid robots are still incredibly primitive.
p133
aVThey can't do very much.
p134
aVBut they're getting better quite quickly
p135
aVand DARPA, which is the investment arm of the Defense Department,
p136
aVis trying to accelerate their trajectory.
p137
aa(lp138
VSo, in short, yeah, the droids are coming for our jobs.
p139
aVIn the short term, we can stimulate job growth
p140
aVby encouraging entrepreneurship
p141
aVand by investing in infrastructure,
p142
aVbecause the robots today still aren't very good at fixing bridges.
p143
aVBut in the not-too-long-term,
p144
aVI think within the lifetimes of most of the people in this room,
p145
aVwe're going to transition into an economy that is very productive,
p146
aVbut that just doesn't need a lot of human workers.
p147
aVAnd managing that transition is going to be the greatest challenge
p148
aVthat our society faces.
p149
aVVoltaire summarized why; he said,
p150
aV"Work saves us from three great evils: boredom, vice and need."
p151
aa(lp152
VBut despite this challenge \u2014
p153
aVpersonally, I'm still a huge digital optimist,
p154
aVand I am supremely confident
p155
aVthat the digital technologies that we're developing now
p156
aVare going to take us into a Utopian future,
p157
aVnot a dystopian future.
p158
aVAnd to explain why,
p159
aVI want to pose a ridiculously broad question.
p160
aVI want to ask:
p161
aVwhat have been the most important developments in human history?
p162
aa(lp163
VNow, I want to share some of the answers that I've gotten
p164
aVin response to this question.
p165
aVIt's a wonderful question to ask and start an endless debate about,
p166
aVbecause some people are going to bring up
p167
aVsystems of philosophy in both the West and the East
p168
aVthat have changed how a lot of people think about the world.
p169
aVAnd then other people will say,
p170
aV"No, actually, the big stories, the big developments
p171
aVare the founding of the world's major religions,
p172
aVwhich have changed civilizations and have changed and influenced
p173
aVhow countless people are living their lives."
p174
aVAnd then some other folk will say,
p175
aV"Actually, what changes civilizations,
p176
aVwhat modifies them and what changes people's lives are empires,
p177
aVso the great developments in human history
p178
aVare stories of conquest and of war."
p179
aVAnd then some cheery soul usually always pipes up and says,
p180
aV"Hey, don't forget about plagues!"
p181
aa(lp182
V(Laughter)
p183
aa(lp184
VThere are some optimistic answers to this question,
p185
aVso some people will bring up the Age of Exploration
p186
aVand the opening up of the world.
p187
aVOthers will talk about intellectual achievements in disciplines like math
p188
aVthat have helped us get a better handle on the world,
p189
aVand other folk will talk about periods when there was a deep flourishing
p190
aVof the arts and sciences.
p191
aVSo this debate will go on and on.
p192
aVIt's an endless debate
p193
aVand there's no conclusive, single answer to it.
p194
aVBut if you're a geek like me,
p195
aVyou say, "Well, what do the data say?"
p196
aVAnd you start to do things
p197
aVlike graph things that we might be interested in \u2014
p198
aVthe total worldwide population, for example,
p199
aVor some measure of social development
p200
aVor the state of advancement of a society.
p201
aVAnd you start to plot the data, because, by this approach,
p202
aVthe big stories, the big developments in human history,
p203
aVare the ones that will bend these curves a lot.
p204
aa(lp205
VSo when you do this and when you plot the data,
p206
aVyou pretty quickly come to some weird conclusions.
p207
aVYou conclude, actually,
p208
aVthat none of these things have mattered very much.
p209
aa(lp210
V(Laughter)
p211
aa(lp212
VThey haven't done a darn thing to the curves.
p213
aVThere has been one story, one development in human history
p214
aVthat bent the curve, bent it just about 90 degrees,
p215
aVand it is a technology story.
p216
aa(lp217
VThe steam engine and the other associated technologies
p218
aVof the Industrial Revolution
p219
aVchanged the world and influenced human history so much,
p220
aVthat in the words of the historian Ian Morris,
p221
aV"... they made mockery out of all that had come before."
p222
aVAnd they did this by infinitely multiplying the power of our muscles,
p223
aVovercoming the limitations of our muscles.
p224
aVNow, what we're in the middle of now
p225
aVis overcoming the limitations of our individual brains
p226
aVand infinitely multiplying our mental power.
p227
aVHow can this not be as big a deal
p228
aVas overcoming the limitations of our muscles?
p229
aa(lp230
VSo at the risk of repeating myself a little bit,
p231
aVwhen I look at what's going on with digital technology these days,
p232
aVwe are not anywhere near through with this journey.
p233
aVAnd when I look at what is happening to our economies and our societies,
p234
aVmy single conclusion is that we ain't seen nothing yet.
p235
aVThe best days are really ahead.
p236
aa(lp237
VLet me give you a couple examples.
p238
aVEconomies don't run on energy.
p239
aVThey don't run on capital, they don't run on labor.
p240
aVEconomies run on ideas.
p241
aVSo the work of innovation, the work of coming up with new ideas,
p242
aVis some of the most powerful, most fundamental work that we can do
p243
aVin an economy.
p244
aVAnd this is kind of how we used to do innovation.
p245
aVWe'd find a bunch of fairly similar-looking people ...
p246
aa(lp247
V(Laughter)
p248
aa(lp249
VWe'd take them out of elite institutions,
p250
aVwe'd put them into other elite institutions
p251
aVand we'd wait for the innovation.
p252
aVNow \u2014
p253
aa(lp254
V(Laughter)
p255
aa(lp256
Vas a white guy who spent his whole career at MIT and Harvard,
p257
aVI've got no problem with this.
p258
aa(lp259
V(Laughter)
p260
aa(lp261
VBut some other people do,
p262
aVand they've kind of crashed the party
p263
aVand loosened up the dress code of innovation.
p264
aa(lp265
V(Laughter)
p266
aa(lp267
VSo here are the winners of a Topcoder programming challenge,
p268
aVand I assure you that nobody cares
p269
aVwhere these kids grew up, where they went to school,
p270
aVor what they look like.
p271
aVAll anyone cares about is the quality of the work, the quality of the ideas.
p272
aa(lp273
VAnd over and over again, we see this happening
p274
aVin the technology-facilitated world.
p275
aVThe work of innovation is becoming more open,
p276
aVmore inclusive, more transparent and more merit-based,
p277
aVand that's going to continue no matter what MIT and Harvard think of it,
p278
aVand I couldn't be happier about that development.
p279
aa(lp280
VI hear once in a while, "OK, I'll grant you that,
p281
aVbut technology is still a tool for the rich world,
p282
aVand what's not happening,
p283
aVthese digital tools are not improving the lives
p284
aVof people at the bottom of the pyramid."
p285
aVAnd I want to say to that very clearly: nonsense.
p286
aVThe bottom of the pyramid is benefiting hugely from technology.
p287
aVThe economist Robert Jensen did this wonderful study a while back
p288
aVwhere he watched, in great detail,
p289
aVwhat happened to the fishing villages of Kerala, India,
p290
aVwhen they got mobile phones for the very first time.
p291
aVAnd when you write for the Quarterly Journal of Economics,
p292
aVyou have to use very dry and very circumspect language.
p293
aVBut when I read his paper,
p294
aVI kind of feel Jensen is trying to scream at us
p295
aVand say, "Look, this was a big deal.
p296
aVPrices stabilized, so people could plan their economic lives.
p297
aVWaste was not reduced \u2014 it was eliminated.
p298
aVAnd the lives of both the buyers and the sellers
p299
aVin these villages measurably improved."
p300
aa(lp301
VNow, what I don't think is that Jensen got extremely lucky
p302
aVand happened to land in the one set of villages
p303
aVwhere technology made things better.
p304
aVWhat happened instead is he very carefully documented
p305
aVwhat happens over and over again when technology comes for the first time
p306
aVto an environment and a community:
p307
aVthe lives of people, the welfares of people, improve dramatically.
p308
aa(lp309
VSo as I look around at all the evidence
p310
aVand I think about the room that we have ahead of us,
p311
aVI become a huge digital optimist
p312
aVand I start to think that this wonderful statement from the physicist Freeman Dyson
p313
aVis actually not hyperbole.
p314
aVThis is an accurate assessment of what's going on.
p315
aVOur technologies are great gifts,
p316
aVand we, right now, have the great good fortune
p317
aVto be living at a time when digital technology is flourishing,
p318
aVwhen it is broadening and deepening and becoming more profound
p319
aVall around the world.
p320
aa(lp321
VSo, yeah, the droids are taking our jobs,
p322
aVbut focusing on that fact misses the point entirely.
p323
aVThe point is that then we are freed up to do other things,
p324
aVand what we're going to do, I am very confident,
p325
aVwhat we're going to do is reduce poverty
p326
aVand drudgery and misery around the world.
p327
aVI'm very confident we're going to learn to live more lightly on the planet,
p328
aVand I am extremely confident that what we're going to do
p329
aVwith our new digital tools
p330
aVis going to be so profound and so beneficial
p331
aVthat it's going to make a mockery out of everything that came before.
p332
aVI'm going to leave the last word
p333
aVto a guy who had a front-row seat for digital progress,
p334
aVour old friend Ken Jennings.
p335
aVI'm with him; I'm going to echo his words:
p336
aV"I, for one, welcome our new computer overlords."
p337
aa(lp338
V(Laughter)
p339
aa(lp340
VThanks very much.
