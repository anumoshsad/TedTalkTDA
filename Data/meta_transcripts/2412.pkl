VI believe that the secret to producing extremely drought-tolerant crops,
p4
aVwhich should go some way to providing food security in the world,
p5
aVlies in resurrection plants,
p6
aVpictured here, in an extremely droughted state.
p7
aVYou might think that these plants look dead,
p8
aVbut they're not.
p9
aVGive them water,
p10
aVand they will resurrect, green up, start growing, in 12 to 48 hours.
p11
aa(lp12
VNow, why would I suggest
p13
aVthat producing drought-tolerant crops will go towards providing food security?
p14
aVWell, the current world population is around 7 billion.
p15
aVAnd it's estimated that by 2050,
p16
aVwe'll be between 9 and 10 billion people,
p17
aVwith the bulk of this growth happening in Africa.
p18
aa(lp19
VThe food and agricultural organizations of the world
p20
aVhave suggested that we need a 70 percent increase
p21
aVin current agricultural practice
p22
aVto meet that demand.
p23
aVGiven that plants are at the base of the food chain,
p24
aVmost of that's going to have to come from plants.
p25
aa(lp26
VThat percentage of 70 percent
p27
aVdoes not take into consideration the potential effects of climate change.
p28
aa(lp29
VThis is taken from a study by Dai published in 2011,
p30
aVwhere he took into consideration
p31
aVall the potential effects of climate change
p32
aVand expressed them \u2014 amongst other things \u2014
p33
aVincreased aridity due to lack of rain or infrequent rain.
p34
aVThe areas in red shown here,
p35
aVare areas that until recently
p36
aVhave been very successfully used for agriculture,
p37
aVbut cannot anymore because of lack of rainfall.
p38
aVThis is the situation that's predicted to happen in 2050.
p39
aVMuch of Africa, in fact, much of the world,
p40
aVis going to be in trouble.
p41
aVWe're going to have to think of some very smart ways of producing food.
p42
aVAnd preferably among them, some drought-tolerant crops.
p43
aa(lp44
VThe other thing to remember about Africa is
p45
aVthat most of their agriculture is rainfed.
p46
aa(lp47
VNow, making drought-tolerant crops is not the easiest thing in the world.
p48
aVAnd the reason for this is water.
p49
aVWater is essential to life on this planet.
p50
aVAll living, actively metabolizing organisms,
p51
aVfrom microbes to you and I,
p52
aVare comprised predominately of water.
p53
aVAll life reactions happen in water.
p54
aVAnd loss of a small amount of water results in death.
p55
aVYou and I are 65 percent water \u2014
p56
aVwe lose one percent of that, we die.
p57
aVBut we can make behavioral changes to avoid that.
p58
aVPlants can't.
p59
aVThey're stuck in the ground.
p60
aVAnd so in the first instance they have a little bit more water than us,
p61
aVabout 95 percent water,
p62
aVand they can lose a little bit more than us,
p63
aVlike 10 to about 70 percent, depending on the species,
p64
aVbut for short periods only.
p65
aa(lp66
VMost of them will either try to resist or avoid water loss.
p67
aVSo extreme examples of resistors can be found in succulents.
p68
aVThey tend to be small, very attractive,
p69
aVbut they hold onto their water at such great cost
p70
aVthat they grow extremely slowly.
p71
aVExamples of avoidance of water loss are found in trees and shrubs.
p72
aVThey send down very deep roots,
p73
aVmine subterranean water supplies
p74
aVand just keep flushing it through them at all times,
p75
aVkeeping themselves hydrated.
p76
aa(lp77
VThe one on the right is called a baobab.
p78
aVIt's also called the upside-down tree,
p79
aVsimply because the proportion of roots to shoots is so great
p80
aVthat it looks like the tree has been planted upside down.
p81
aVAnd of course the roots are required for hydration of that plant.
p82
aa(lp83
VAnd probably the most common strategy of avoidance is found in annuals.
p84
aVAnnuals make up the bulk of our plant food supplies.
p85
aVUp the west coast of my country,
p86
aVfor much of the year you don't see much vegetation growth.
p87
aVBut come the spring rains, you get this:
p88
aVflowering of the desert.
p89
aa(lp90
VThe strategy in annuals,
p91
aVis to grow only in the rainy season.
p92
aVAt the end of that season they produce a seed,
p93
aVwhich is dry, eight to 10 percent water,
p94
aVbut very much alive.
p95
aVAnd anything that is that dry and still alive,
p96
aVwe call desiccation-tolerant.
p97
aa(lp98
VIn the desiccated state,
p99
aVwhat seeds can do is lie in extremes of environment
p100
aVfor prolonged periods of time.
p101
aVThe next time the rainy season comes,
p102
aVthey germinate and grow,
p103
aVand the whole cycle just starts again.
p104
aa(lp105
VIt's widely believed that the evolution of desiccation-tolerant seeds
p106
aVallowed the colonization and the radiation
p107
aVof flowering plants, or angiosperms, onto land.
p108
aa(lp109
VBut back to annuals as our major form of food supplies.
p110
aVWheat, rice and maize form 95 percent of our plant food supplies.
p111
aVAnd it's been a great strategy
p112
aVbecause in a short space of time you can produce a lot of seed.
p113
aVSeeds are energy-rich so there's a lot of food calories,
p114
aVyou can store it in times of plenty for times of famine,
p115
aVbut there's a downside.
p116
aVThe vegetative tissues,
p117
aVthe roots and leaves of annuals,
p118
aVdo not have much
p119
aVby way of inherent resistance, avoidance or tolerance characteristics.
p120
aVThey just don't need them.
p121
aVThey grow in the rainy season
p122
aVand they've got a seed to help them survive the rest of the year.
p123
aa(lp124
VAnd so despite concerted efforts in agriculture
p125
aVto make crops with improved properties
p126
aVof resistance, avoidance and tolerance \u2014
p127
aVparticularly resistance and avoidance
p128
aVbecause we've had good models to understand how those work \u2014
p129
aVwe still get images like this.
p130
aVMaize crop in Africa,
p131
aVtwo weeks without rain
p132
aVand it's dead.
p133
aa(lp134
VThere is a solution:
p135
aVresurrection plants.
p136
aVThese plants can lose 95 percent of their cellular water,
p137
aVremain in a dry, dead-like state for months to years,
p138
aVand give them water,
p139
aVthey green up and start growing again.
p140
aVLike seeds, these are desiccation-tolerant.
p141
aVLike seeds, these can withstand extremes of environmental conditions.
p142
aVAnd this is a really rare phenomenon.
p143
aVThere are only 135 flowering plant species that can do this.
p144
aa(lp145
VI'm going to show you a video
p146
aVof the resurrection process of these three species
p147
aVin that order.
p148
aVAnd at the bottom,
p149
aVthere's a time axis so you can see how quickly it happens.
p150
aa(lp151
V(Applause)
p152
aa(lp153
VPretty amazing, huh?
p154
aa(lp155
VSo I've spent the last 21 years trying to understand how they do this.
p156
aVHow do these plants dry without dying?
p157
aVAnd I work on a variety of different resurrection plants,
p158
aVshown here in the hydrated and dry states,
p159
aVfor a number of reasons.
p160
aa(lp161
VOne of them is that each of these plants serves as a model
p162
aVfor a crop that I'd like to make drought-tolerant.
p163
aa(lp164
VSo on the extreme top left, for example, is a grass,
p165
aVit's called Eragrostis nindensis,
p166
aVit's got a close relative called Eragrostis tef \u2014
p167
aVa lot of you might know it as "teff" \u2014
p168
aVit's a staple food in Ethiopia,
p169
aVit's gluten-free,
p170
aVand it's something we would like to make drought-tolerant.
p171
aa(lp172
VThe other reason for looking at a number of plants,
p173
aVis that, at least initially,
p174
aVI wanted to find out: do they do the same thing?
p175
aVDo they all use the same mechanisms
p176
aVto be able to lose all that water and not die?
p177
aa(lp178
VSo I undertook what we call a systems biology approach
p179
aVin order to get a comprehensive understanding
p180
aVof desiccation tolerance,
p181
aVin which we look at everything
p182
aVfrom the molecular to the whole plant, ecophysiological level.
p183
aa(lp184
VFor example we look at things like
p185
aVchanges in the plant anatomy as they dried out
p186
aVand their ultrastructure.
p187
aVWe look at the transcriptome, which is just a term for a technology
p188
aVin which we look at the genes
p189
aVthat are switched on or off, in response to drying.
p190
aVMost genes will code for proteins, so we look at the proteome.
p191
aVWhat are the proteins made in response to drying?
p192
aVSome proteins would code for enzymes which make metabolites,
p193
aVso we look at the metabolome.
p194
aa(lp195
VNow, this is important because plants are stuck in the ground.
p196
aVThey use what I call a highly tuned chemical arsenal
p197
aVto protect themselves from all the stresses of their environment.
p198
aVSo it's important that we look
p199
aVat the chemical changes involved in drying.
p200
aa(lp201
VAnd at the last study that we do at the molecular level,
p202
aVwe look at the lipidome \u2014
p203
aVthe lipid changes in response to drying.
p204
aVAnd that's also important
p205
aVbecause all biological membranes are made of lipids.
p206
aVThey're held as membranes because they're in water.
p207
aVTake away the water, those membranes fall apart.
p208
aVLipids also act as signals to turn on genes.
p209
aa(lp210
VThen we use physiological and biochemical studies
p211
aVto try and understand the function of the putative protectants
p212
aVthat we've actually discovered in our other studies.
p213
aVAnd then use all of that to try and understand
p214
aVhow the plant copes with its natural environment.
p215
aa(lp216
VI've always had the philosophy that I needed a comprehensive understanding
p217
aVof the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance
p218
aVin order to make a meaningful suggestion for a biotic application.
p219
aa(lp220
VI'm sure some of you are thinking,
p221
aV"By biotic application,
p222
aVdoes she mean she's going to make genetically modified crops?"
p223
aVAnd the answer to that question is:
p224
aVdepends on your definition of genetic modification.
p225
aa(lp226
VAll of the crops that we eat today, wheat, rice and maize,
p227
aVare highly genetically modified from their ancestors,
p228
aVbut we don't consider them GM
p229
aVbecause they're being produced by conventional breeding.
p230
aVIf you mean, am I going to put resurrection plant genes into crops,
p231
aVyour answer is yes.
p232
aa(lp233
VIn the essence of time, we have tried that approach.
p234
aVMore appropriately, some of my collaborators at UCT,
p235
aVJennifer Thomson, Suhail Rafudeen,
p236
aVhave spearheaded that approach
p237
aVand I'm going to show you some data soon.
p238
aa(lp239
VBut we're about to embark upon an extremely ambitious approach,
p240
aVin which we aim to turn on whole suites of genes
p241
aVthat are already present in every crop.
p242
aVThey're just never turned on under extreme drought conditions.
p243
aVI leave it up to you to decide
p244
aVwhether those should be called GM or not.
p245
aa(lp246
VI'm going to now just give you some of the data from that first approach.
p247
aVAnd in order to do that
p248
aVI have to explain a little bit about how genes work.
p249
aa(lp250
VSo you probably all know
p251
aVthat genes are made of double-stranded DNA.
p252
aVIt's wound very tightly into chromosomes
p253
aVthat are present in every cell of your body or in a plant's body.
p254
aVIf you unwind that DNA, you get genes.
p255
aVAnd each gene has a promoter,
p256
aVwhich is just an on-off switch,
p257
aVthe gene coding region,
p258
aVand then a terminator,
p259
aVwhich indicates that this is the end of this gene, the next gene will start.
p260
aa(lp261
VNow, promoters are not simple on-off switches.
p262
aVThey normally require a lot of fine-tuning,
p263
aVlots of things to be present and correct before that gene is switched on.
p264
aVSo what's typically done in biotech studies
p265
aVis that we use an inducible promoter,
p266
aVwe know how to switch it on.
p267
aVWe couple that to genes of interest
p268
aVand put that into a plant and see how the plant responds.
p269
aa(lp270
VIn the study that I'm going to talk to you about,
p271
aVmy collaborators used a drought-induced promoter,
p272
aVwhich we discovered in a resurrection plant.
p273
aVThe nice thing about this promoter is that we do nothing.
p274
aVThe plant itself senses drought.
p275
aVAnd we've used it to drive antioxidant genes from resurrection plants.
p276
aVWhy antioxidant genes?
p277
aVWell, all stresses, particularly drought stress,
p278
aVresults in the formation of free radicals,
p279
aVor reactive oxygen species,
p280
aVwhich are highly damaging and can cause crop death.
p281
aVWhat antioxidants do is stop that damage.
p282
aa(lp283
VSo here's some data from a maize strain that's very popularly used in Africa.
p284
aVTo the left of the arrow are plants without the genes,
p285
aVto the right \u2014
p286
aVplants with the antioxidant genes.
p287
aVAfter three weeks without watering,
p288
aVthe ones with the genes do a hell of a lot better.
p289
aa(lp290
VNow to the final approach.
p291
aVMy research has shown that there's considerable similarity
p292
aVin the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance in seeds and resurrection plants.
p293
aVSo I ask the question,
p294
aVare they using the same genes?
p295
aVOr slightly differently phrased,
p296
aVare resurrection plants using genes evolved in seed desiccation tolerance
p297
aVin their roots and leaves?
p298
aVHave they retasked these seed genes
p299
aVin roots and leaves of resurrection plants?
p300
aa(lp301
VAnd I answer that question,
p302
aVas a consequence of a lot of research from my group
p303
aVand recent collaborations from a group of Henk Hilhorst in the Netherlands,
p304
aVMel Oliver in the United States
p305
aVand Julia Buitink in France.
p306
aVThe answer is yes,
p307
aVthat there is a core set of genes that are involved in both.
p308
aa(lp309
VAnd I'm going to illustrate this very crudely for maize,
p310
aVwhere the chromosomes below the off switch
p311
aVrepresent all the genes that are required for desiccation tolerance.
p312
aVSo as maize seeds dried out at the end of their period of development,
p313
aVthey switch these genes on.
p314
aVResurrection plants switch on the same genes
p315
aVwhen they dry out.
p316
aVAll modern crops, therefore,
p317
aVhave these genes in their roots and leaves,
p318
aVthey just never switch them on.
p319
aVThey only switch them on in seed tissues.
p320
aa(lp321
VSo what we're trying to do right now
p322
aVis to understand the environmental and cellular signals
p323
aVthat switch on these genes in resurrection plants,
p324
aVto mimic the process in crops.
p325
aa(lp326
VAnd just a final thought.
p327
aVWhat we're trying to do very rapidly
p328
aVis to repeat what nature did in the evolution of resurrection plants
p329
aVsome 10 to 40 million years ago.
