VRecently, I flew over a crowd
p4
aVof thousands of people in Brazil
p5
aVplaying music by George Frideric Handel.
p6
aVI also drove along the streets of Amsterdam,
p7
aVagain playing music by this same composer.
p8
aVLet's take a look.

p13
aV(In Dutch) I live there on the corner.
p14
aVI actually live there, around the corner.
p15
aVand you'd be really welcome.

aa(lp23
VDaria van den Bercken: All this was a real
p24
aVmagical experience for hundreds of reasons.
p25
aa(lp26
VNow you may ask, why have I done these things?
p27
aVThey're not really typical for a musician's
p28
aVday-to-day life.
p29
aVWell, I did it because I fell in love with the music
p30
aVand I wanted to share it with as many people
p31
aVas possible.
p32
aa(lp33
VIt started a couple of years ago.
p34
aVI was sitting at home on the couch with the flu
p35
aVand browsing the Internet a little,
p36
aVwhen I found out that Handel had written works
p37
aVfor the keyboard.
p38
aVWell, I was surprised. I did not know this.
p39
aVSo I downloaded the sheet music and started playing.
p40
aVAnd what happened next was
p41
aVthat I entered this state of pure,
p42
aVunprejudiced amazement.
p43
aVIt was an experience
p44
aVof being totally in awe of the music,
p45
aVand I had not felt that in a long time.
p46
aVIt might be easier to relate to this when you hear it.
p47
aVThe first piece that I played through
p48
aVstarted like this.
p49
aa(lp50
V(Music)
p51
aa(lp52
VWell this sounds very melancholic, doesn't it?
p53
aVAnd I turned the page and what came next
p54
aVwas this.
p55
aa(lp56
V(Music)
p57
aa(lp58
VWell, this sounds very energetic, doesn't it?
p59
aVSo within a couple of minutes,
p60
aVand the piece isn't even finished yet,
p61
aVI experienced two very contrasting characters:
p62
aVbeautiful melancholy and sheer energy.
p63
aVAnd I consider these two elements to be
p64
aVvital human expressions.
p65
aVAnd the purity of the music makes you hear it
p66
aVvery effectively.
p67
aa(lp68
VI've given a lot of children's concerts
p69
aVfor children of seven and eight years old,
p70
aVand whatever I play, whether it's Bach, Beethoven,
p71
aVeven Stockhausen,
p72
aVor some jazzy music,
p73
aVthey are open to hear it,
p74
aVreally willing to listen,
p75
aVand they are comfortable doing so.
p76
aVAnd when classes come in
p77
aVwith children who are just a few years older,
p78
aV11, 12, I felt that I sometimes already had trouble
p79
aVin reaching them like that.
p80
aVThe complexity of the music does become an issue,
p81
aVand actually the opinions of others \u2014
p82
aVparents, friends, media \u2014 they start to count.
p83
aVBut the young ones, they don't question
p84
aVtheir own opinion.
p85
aVThey are in this constant state of wonder,
p86
aVand I do firmly believe that we can keep listening
p87
aVlike these seven-year-old children,
p88
aVeven when growing up.
p89
aVAnd that is why I have played
p90
aVnot only in the concert hall
p91
aVbut also on the street, online, in the air:
p92
aVto feel that state of wonder,
p93
aVto truly listen,
p94
aVand to listen without prejudice.
p95
aVAnd I would like to invite you
p96
aVto do so now.
