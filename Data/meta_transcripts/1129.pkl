VI would like to talk today
p4
aVabout what I think is one of the greatest adventures
p5
aVhuman beings have embarked upon,
p6
aVwhich is the quest to understand the universe
p7
aVand our place in it.
p8
aVMy own interest in this subject, and my passion for it,
p9
aVbegan rather accidentally.
p10
aVI had bought a copy of this book,
p11
aV"The Universe and Dr. Einstein" \u2014
p12
aVa used paperback from a secondhand bookstore in Seattle.
p13
aVA few years after that, in Bangalore,
p14
aVI was finding it hard to fall asleep one night,
p15
aVand I picked up this book,
p16
aVthinking it would put me to sleep in 10 minutes.
p17
aVAnd as it happened,
p18
aVI read it from midnight to five in the morning in one shot.
p19
aVAnd I was left with this intense feeling
p20
aVof awe and exhilaration
p21
aVat the universe
p22
aVand our own ability to understand as much as we do.
p23
aVAnd that feeling hasn't left me yet.
p24
aa(lp25
VThat feeling was the trigger for me
p26
aVto actually change my career \u2014
p27
aVfrom being a software engineer to become a science writer \u2014
p28
aVso that I could partake in the joy of science,
p29
aVand also the joy of communicating it to others.
p30
aVAnd that feeling also led me
p31
aVto a pilgrimage of sorts,
p32
aVto go literally to the ends of the earth
p33
aVto see telescopes, detectors,
p34
aVinstruments that people are building, or have built,
p35
aVin order to probe the cosmos
p36
aVin greater and greater detail.
p37
aVSo it took me from places like Chile \u2014
p38
aVthe Atacama Desert in Chile \u2014
p39
aVto Siberia,
p40
aVto underground mines
p41
aVin the Japanese Alps, in Northern America,
p42
aVall the way to Antarctica
p43
aVand even to the South Pole.
p44
aa(lp45
VAnd today I would like to share with you
p46
aVsome images, some stories of these trips.
p47
aVI have been basically spending the last few years
p48
aVdocumenting the efforts
p49
aVof some extremely intrepid men and women
p50
aVwho are putting,
p51
aVliterally at times, their lives at stake
p52
aVworking in some very remote and very hostile places
p53
aVso that they may gather the faintest signals from the cosmos
p54
aVin order for us to understand this universe.
p55
aa(lp56
VAnd I first begin with a pie chart \u2014
p57
aVand I promise this is the only pie chart
p58
aVin the whole presentation \u2014
p59
aVbut it sets up the state of our knowledge of the cosmos.
p60
aVAll the theories in physics that we have today
p61
aVproperly explain what is called normal matter \u2014
p62
aVthe stuff that we're all made of \u2014
p63
aVand that's four percent of the universe.
p64
aVAstronomers and cosmologists and physicists think
p65
aVthat there is something called dark matter in the universe,
p66
aVwhich makes up 23 percent of the universe,
p67
aVand something called dark energy,
p68
aVwhich permeates the fabric of space-time,
p69
aVthat makes up another 73 percent.
p70
aVSo if you look at this pie chart, 96 percent of the universe,
p71
aVat this point in our exploration of it,
p72
aVis unknown or not well understood.
p73
aVAnd most of the experiments, telescopes that I went to see
p74
aVare in some way addressing this question,
p75
aVthese two twin mysteries of dark matter and dark energy.
p76
aa(lp77
VI will take you first to an underground mine
p78
aVin Northern Minnesota
p79
aVwhere people are looking
p80
aVfor something called dark matter.
p81
aVAnd the idea here is that they are looking for a sign
p82
aVof a dark matter particle hitting one of their detectors.
p83
aVAnd the reason why they have to go underground
p84
aVis that, if you did this experiment on the surface of the Earth,
p85
aVthe same experiment would be swamped by signals
p86
aVthat could be created by things like cosmic rays,
p87
aVambient radio activity,
p88
aVeven our own bodies. You might not believe it,
p89
aVbut even our own bodies are radioactive enough to disturb this experiment.
p90
aVSo they go deep inside mines
p91
aVto find a kind of environmental silence
p92
aVthat will allow them to hear
p93
aVthe ping of a dark matter particle hitting their detector.
p94
aa(lp95
VAnd I went to see one of these experiments,
p96
aVand this is actually \u2014 you can barely see it,
p97
aVand the reason for that is it's entirely dark in there \u2014
p98
aVthis is a cavern that was left behind by the miners
p99
aVwho left this mine in 1960.
p100
aVAnd physicists came and started using it
p101
aVsometime in the 1980s.
p102
aVAnd the miners in the early part of the last century
p103
aVworked, literally, in candlelight.
p104
aVAnd today, you would see this inside the mine,
p105
aVhalf a mile underground.
p106
aVThis is one of the largest underground labs in the world.
p107
aVAnd, among other things, they're looking for dark matter.
p108
aa(lp109
VThere is another way to search for dark matter,
p110
aVwhich is indirectly.
p111
aVIf dark matter exists in our universe,
p112
aVin our galaxy,
p113
aVthen these particles should be smashing together
p114
aVand producing other particles that we know about \u2014
p115
aVone of them being neutrinos.
p116
aVAnd neutrinos you can detect
p117
aVby the signature they leave
p118
aVwhen they hit water molecules.
p119
aVWhen a neutrino hits a water molecule
p120
aVit emits a kind of blue light,
p121
aVa flash of blue light,
p122
aVand by looking for this blue light,
p123
aVyou can essentially understand something about the neutrino
p124
aVand then, indirectly, something about the dark matter
p125
aVthat might have created this neutrino.
p126
aVBut you need very, very large volumes of water
p127
aVin order to do this.
p128
aVYou need something like tens of megatons of water \u2014
p129
aValmost a gigaton of water \u2014
p130
aVin order to have any chance of catching this neutrino.
p131
aVAnd where in the world would you find such water?
p132
aVWell the Russians have a tank in their own backyard.
p133
aa(lp134
VThis is Lake Baikal.
p135
aVIt is the largest lake in the world. It's 800 km long.
p136
aVIt's about 40 to 50 km wide
p137
aVin most places,
p138
aVand one to two kilometers deep.
p139
aVAnd what the Russians are doing
p140
aVis they're building these detectors
p141
aVand immersing them about a kilometer beneath the surface of the lake
p142
aVso that they can watch for these flashes of blue light.
p143
aVAnd this is the scene that greeted me when I landed there.
p144
aVThis is Lake Baikal
p145
aVin the peak of the Siberian winter.
p146
aVThe lake is entirely frozen.
p147
aVAnd the line of black dots
p148
aVthat you see in the background,
p149
aVthat's the ice camp where the physicists are working.
p150
aVThe reason why they have to work in winter
p151
aVis because they don't have the money to work in summer and spring,
p152
aVwhich, if they did that,
p153
aVthey would need ships and submersibles to do their work.
p154
aVSo they wait until winter \u2014
p155
aVthe lake is completely frozen over \u2014
p156
aVand they use this meter-thick ice
p157
aVas a platform on which to establish their ice camp and do their work.
p158
aa(lp159
VSo this is the Russians working on the ice
p160
aVin the peak of the Siberian winter.
p161
aVThey have to drill holes in the ice,
p162
aVdive down into the water \u2014 cold, cold water \u2014
p163
aVto get hold of the instrument, bring it up,
p164
aVdo any repairs and maintenance that they need to do,
p165
aVput it back and get out before the ice melts.
p166
aVBecause that phase of solid ice lasts for two months
p167
aVand it's full of cracks.
p168
aVAnd you have to imagine, there's an entire sea-like lake
p169
aVunderneath, moving.
p170
aVI still don't understand this one Russian man
p171
aVworking in his bare chest,
p172
aVbut that tells you how hard he was working.
p173
aVAnd these people, a handful of people,
p174
aVhave been working for 20 years,
p175
aVlooking for particles that may or may not exist.
p176
aVAnd they have dedicated their lives to it.
p177
aVAnd just to give you an idea,
p178
aVthey have spent 20 million over 20 years.
p179
aVIt's very harsh conditions.
p180
aVThey work on a shoestring budget.
p181
aVThe toilets there are literally holes in the ground
p182
aVcovered with a wooden shack.
p183
aVAnd it's that basic,
p184
aVbut they do this every year.
p185
aa(lp186
VFrom Siberia to the Atacama Desert in Chile,
p187
aVto see something called The Very Large Telescope.
p188
aVThe Very Large Telescope
p189
aVis one of these things that astronomers do \u2014
p190
aVthey name their telescopes rather unimaginatively.
p191
aVI can tell you for a fact,
p192
aVthat the next one that they're planning is called The Extremely Large Telescope.
p193
aV(Laughter)
p194
aVAnd you wouldn't believe it,
p195
aVbut the one after that is going to be called The Overwhelmingly Large Telescope.
p196
aVBut nonetheless,
p197
aVit's an extraordinary piece of engineering.
p198
aVThese are four 8.2 meter telescopes.
p199
aVAnd these telescopes, among other things,
p200
aVthey're being used to study
p201
aVhow the expansion of the universe is changing with time.
p202
aVAnd the more you understand that,
p203
aVthe better you would understand
p204
aVwhat this dark energy that the universe is made of is all about.
p205
aa(lp206
VAnd one piece of engineering that I want to leave you with
p207
aVas regards this telescope
p208
aVis the mirror.
p209
aVEach mirror, there are four of them,
p210
aVis made of a single piece of glass,
p211
aVa monolithic piece of high-tech ceramic,
p212
aVthat has been ground down and polished to such accuracy
p213
aVthat the only way to understand what that is
p214
aVis [to] imagine a city like Paris,
p215
aVwith all its buildings and the Eiffel Tower,
p216
aVif you grind down Paris to that kind of accuracy,
p217
aVyou would be left with bumps that are one millimeter high.
p218
aVAnd that's the kind of polishing that these mirrors have endured.
p219
aVAn extraordinary set of telescopes.
p220
aVHere's another view of the same.
p221
aVThe reason why you have to build these telescopes
p222
aVin places like the Atacama Desert
p223
aVis because of the high altitude desert.
p224
aVThe dry air is really good for telescopes,
p225
aVand also, the cloud cover is below the summit of these mountains
p226
aVso that the telescopes have
p227
aVabout 300 days of clear skies.
p228
aa(lp229
VFinally, I want to take you to Antarctica.
p230
aVI want to spend most of my time on this part of the world.
p231
aVThis is cosmology's final frontier.
p232
aVSome of the most amazing experiments,
p233
aVsome of the most extreme experiments,
p234
aVare being done in Antarctica.
p235
aVI was there to view something called a long-duration balloon flight,
p236
aVwhich basically takes telescopes and instruments
p237
aVall the way to the upper atmosphere,
p238
aVthe upper stratosphere, 40 km up.
p239
aVAnd that's where they do their experiments,
p240
aVand then the balloon, the payload, is brought down.
p241
aVSo this is us landing on the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica.
p242
aVThat's an American C-17 cargo plane
p243
aVthat flew us from New Zealand
p244
aVto McMurdo in Antarctica.
p245
aVAnd here we are about to board our bus.
p246
aVAnd I don't know if you can read the lettering,
p247
aVbut it says, "Ivan the Terribus."
p248
aVAnd that's taking us to McMurdo.
p249
aa(lp250
VAnd this is the scene that greets you in McMurdo.
p251
aVAnd you barely might be able to make out
p252
aVthis hut here.
p253
aVThis hut was built by Robert Falcon Scott and his men
p254
aVwhen they first came to Antarctica
p255
aVon their first expedition to go to the South Pole.
p256
aVBecause it's so cold,
p257
aVthe entire contents of that hut is still as they left it,
p258
aVwith the remnants of the last meal they cooked still there.
p259
aVIt's an extraordinary place.
p260
aVThis is McMurdo itself. About a thousand people work here in summer,
p261
aVand about 200 in winter
p262
aVwhen it's completely dark for six months.
p263
aa(lp264
VI was here to see the launch
p265
aVof this particular type of instrument.
p266
aVThis is a cosmic ray experiment
p267
aVthat has been launched all the way to the upper-stratosphere
p268
aVto an altitude of 40 km.
p269
aVWhat I want you to imagine is this is two tons in weight.
p270
aVSo you're using a balloon
p271
aVto carry something that is two tons
p272
aVall the way to an altitude of 40 km.
p273
aVAnd the engineers, the technicians, the physicists
p274
aVhave all got to assemble on the Ross Ice Shelf,
p275
aVbecause Antarctica \u2014 I won't go into the reasons why \u2014
p276
aVbut it's one of the most favorable places for doing these balloon launches,
p277
aVexcept for the weather.
p278
aVThe weather, as you can imagine,
p279
aVthis is summer, and you're standing on 200 ft of ice.
p280
aVAnd there's a volcano behind,
p281
aVwhich has glaciers at the very top.
p282
aVAnd what they have to do
p283
aVis they have to assemble the entire balloon \u2014
p284
aVthe fabric, parachute and everything \u2014 on the ice
p285
aVand then fill it up with helium.
p286
aVAnd that process takes about two hours.
p287
aa(lp288
VAnd the weather can change as they're putting together this whole assembly.
p289
aVFor instance, here they are laying down the balloon fabric behind,
p290
aVwhich is eventually going to be filled up with helium.
p291
aVThose two trucks you see at the very end
p292
aVcarry 12 tanks each of compressed helium.
p293
aVNow, in case the weather changes before the launch,
p294
aVthey have to actually pack everything back up into their boxes
p295
aVand take it out back to McMurdo Station.
p296
aVAnd this particular balloon,
p297
aVbecause it has to launch two tons of weight,
p298
aVis an extremely huge balloon.
p299
aVThe fabric alone weighs two tons.
p300
aVIn order to minimize the weight,
p301
aVit's very thin, it's as thin as a sandwich wrapper.
p302
aVAnd if they have to pack it back,
p303
aVthey have to put it into boxes
p304
aVand stamp on it so that it fits into the box again \u2014
p305
aVexcept, when they did it first,
p306
aVit would have been done in Texas.
p307
aVHere, they can't do it with the kind shoes they're wearing,
p308
aVso they have to take their shoes off,
p309
aVget barefoot into the boxes, in this cold,
p310
aVand do that kind of work.
p311
aVThat's the kind of dedication these people have.
p312
aa(lp313
VHere's the balloon being filled up with helium,
p314
aVand you can see it's a gorgeous sight.
p315
aVHere's a scene
p316
aVthat shows you the balloon and the payload end-to-end.
p317
aVSo the balloon is being filled up with helium on the left-hand side,
p318
aVand the fabric actually runs all the way to the middle
p319
aVwhere there's a piece of electronics and explosives
p320
aVbeing connected to a parachute,
p321
aVand then the parachute is then connected to the payload.
p322
aVAnd remember, all this wiring is being done
p323
aVby people in extreme cold, in sub-zero temperatures.
p324
aVThey're wearing about 15 kg of clothing and stuff,
p325
aVbut they have to take their gloves off in order to do that.
p326
aVAnd I would like to share with you a launch.
p327
aa(lp328
V(Video) Radio: Okay, release the balloon,
p329
aVrelease the balloon, release the balloon.
p330
aa(lp331
VAnil Ananthaswamy: And I'll finally like to leave you with two images.
p332
aVThis is an observatory in the Himalayas, in Ladakh in India.
p333
aVAnd the thing I want you to look at here
p334
aVis the telescope on the right-hand side.
p335
aVAnd on the far left there
p336
aVis a 400 year-old Buddhist monastery.
p337
aVThis is a close-up of the Buddhist monastery.
p338
aVAnd I was struck by the juxtaposition
p339
aVof these two enormous disciplines that humanity has.
p340
aVOne is exploring the cosmos on the outside,
p341
aVand the other one is exploring our interior being.
p342
aVAnd both require silence of some sort.
p343
aa(lp344
VAnd what struck me was
p345
aVevery place that I went to to see these telescopes,
p346
aVthe astronomers and cosmologists
p347
aVare in search of a certain kind of silence,
p348
aVwhether it's silence from radio pollution
p349
aVor light pollution or whatever.
p350
aVAnd it was very obvious
p351
aVthat, if we destroy these silent places on Earth,
p352
aVwe will be stuck on a planet without the ability to look outwards,
p353
aVbecause we will not be able to understand the signals that come from outer space.
p354
