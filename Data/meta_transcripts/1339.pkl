VWe do not invest in victims,
p4
aVwe invest in survivors.
p5
aVAnd in ways both big and small,
p6
aVthe narrative of the victim
p7
aVshapes the way we see women.
p8
aVYou can't count what you don't see.
p9
aVAnd we don't invest in what's invisible to us.
p10
aVBut this is the face
p11
aVof resilience.
p12
aa(lp13
VSix years ago,
p14
aVI started writing about women entrepreneurs
p15
aVduring and after conflict.
p16
aVI set out to write a compelling economic story,
p17
aVone that had great characters, that no one else was telling,
p18
aVand one that I thought mattered.
p19
aVAnd that turned out to be women.
p20
aa(lp21
VI had left ABC news and a career I loved at the age of 30
p22
aVfor business school,
p23
aVa path I knew almost nothing about.
p24
aVNone of the women I had grown up with in Maryland
p25
aVhad graduated from college,
p26
aVlet alone considered business school.
p27
aVBut they had hustled to feed their kids
p28
aVand pay their rent.
p29
aVAnd I saw from a young age
p30
aVthat having a decent job and earning a good living
p31
aVmade the biggest difference
p32
aVfor families who were struggling.
p33
aa(lp34
VSo if you're going to talk about jobs,
p35
aVthen you have to talk about entrepreneurs.
p36
aVAnd if you're talking about entrepreneurs
p37
aVin conflict and post-conflict settings,
p38
aVthen you must talk about women,
p39
aVbecause they are the population you have left.
p40
aVRwanda in the immediate aftermath of the genocide
p41
aVwas 77 percent female.
p42
aVI want to introduce you
p43
aVto some of those entrepreneurs I've met
p44
aVand share with you some of what they've taught me over the years.
p45
aa(lp46
VI went to Afghanistan in 2005
p47
aVto work on a Financial Times piece,
p48
aVand there I met Kamila,
p49
aVa young women who told me she had just turned down
p50
aVa job with the international community
p51
aVthat would have paid her nearly $2,000 a month \u2014
p52
aVan astronomical sum in that context.
p53
aVAnd she had turned it down, she said,
p54
aVbecause she was going to start her next business,
p55
aVan entrepreneurship consultancy
p56
aVthat would teach business skills
p57
aVto men and women all around Afghanistan.
p58
aVBusiness, she said,
p59
aVwas critical to her country's future.
p60
aVBecause long after this round of internationals left,
p61
aVbusiness would help keep her country
p62
aVpeaceful and secure.
p63
aVAnd she said business was even more important for women
p64
aVbecause earning an income earned respect
p65
aVand money was power for women.
p66
aa(lp67
VSo I was amazed.
p68
aVI mean here was a girl who had never lived in peace time
p69
aVwho somehow had come to sound like a candidate from "The Apprentice."
p70
aV(Laughter)
p71
aVSo I asked her, "How in the world do you know this much about business?
p72
aVWhy are you so passionate?"
p73
aVShe said, "Oh Gayle, this is actually my third business.
p74
aVMy first business was a dressmaking business
p75
aVI started under the Taliban.
p76
aVAnd that was actually an excellent business,
p77
aVbecause we provided jobs for women all around our neighborhood.
p78
aVAnd that's really how I became an entrepreneur."
p79
aa(lp80
VThink about this:
p81
aVHere were girls who braved danger
p82
aVto become breadwinners
p83
aVduring years in which they couldn't even be on their streets.
p84
aVAnd at a time of economic collapse
p85
aVwhen people sold baby dolls and shoe laces
p86
aVand windows and doors
p87
aVjust to survive,
p88
aVthese girls made the difference
p89
aVbetween survival and starvation
p90
aVfor so many.
p91
aVI couldn't leave the story, and I couldn't leave the topic either,
p92
aVbecause everywhere I went I met more of these women
p93
aVwho no one seemed to know about,
p94
aVor even wish to.
p95
aa(lp96
VI went on to Bosnia,
p97
aVand early on in my interviews I met with an IMF official
p98
aVwho said, "You know, Gayle,
p99
aVI don't think we actually have women in business in Bosnia,
p100
aVbut there is a lady selling cheese nearby
p101
aVon the side of the road.
p102
aVSo maybe you could interview her."
p103
aVSo I went out reporting
p104
aVand within a day I met Narcisa Kavazovic
p105
aVwho at that point was opening a new factory
p106
aVon the war's former front lines in Sarajevo.
p107
aVShe had started her business
p108
aVsquatting in an abandoned garage,
p109
aVsewing sheets and pillow cases
p110
aVshe would take to markets all around the city
p111
aVso that she could support
p112
aVthe 12 or 13 family members
p113
aVwho were counting on her for survival.
p114
aVBy the time we met, she had 20 employees,
p115
aVmost of them women,
p116
aVwho were sending their boys and their girls to school.
p117
aVAnd she was just the start.
p118
aVI met women running essential oils businesses,
p119
aVwineries
p120
aVand even the country's largest advertising agency.
p121
aa(lp122
VSo these stories together
p123
aVbecame the Herald Tribune business cover.
p124
aVAnd when this story posted,
p125
aVI ran to my computer to send it to the IMF official.
p126
aVAnd I said, "Just in case you're looking for entrepreneurs
p127
aVto feature at your next investment conference,
p128
aVhere are a couple of women."
p129
aa(lp130
V(Applause)
p131
aa(lp132
VBut think about this.
p133
aVThe IMF official is hardly the only person
p134
aVto automatically file women under micro.
p135
aVThe biases, whether intentional or otherwise,
p136
aVare pervasive,
p137
aVand so are the misleading mental images.
p138
aVIf you see the word "microfinance,"
p139
aVwhat comes to mind?
p140
aVMost people say women.
p141
aVAnd if you see the word "entrepreneur,"
p142
aVmost people think men.
p143
aVWhy is that?
p144
aVBecause we aim low and we think small
p145
aVwhen it comes to women.
p146
aa(lp147
VMicrofinance is an incredibly powerful tool
p148
aVthat leads to self-sufficiency and self-respect,
p149
aVbut we must move beyond micro-hopes
p150
aVand micro-ambitions for women,
p151
aVbecause they have so much greater hopes for themselves.
p152
aVThey want to move from micro to medium and beyond.
p153
aVAnd in many places,
p154
aVthey're there.
p155
aVIn the U.S., women-owned businesses
p156
aVwill create five and a half million new jobs by 2018.
p157
aVIn South Korea and Indonesia,
p158
aVwomen own nearly half a million firms.
p159
aVChina, women run 20 percent
p160
aVof all small businesses.
p161
aVAnd in the developing world overall,
p162
aVThat figure is 40 to 50 percent.
p163
aa(lp164
VNearly everywhere I go,
p165
aVI meet incredibly interesting entrepreneurs
p166
aVwho are seeking access to finance, access to markets
p167
aVand established business networks.
p168
aVThey are often ignored
p169
aVbecause they're harder to help.
p170
aVIt is much riskier to give a 50,000 dollar loan
p171
aVthan it is to give a 500 dollar loan.
p172
aVAnd as the World Bank recently noted,
p173
aVwomen are stuck in a productivity trap.
p174
aVThose in small businesses
p175
aVcan't get the capital they need to expand
p176
aVand those in microbusiness
p177
aVcan't grow out of them.
p178
aa(lp179
VRecently I was at the State Department in Washington
p180
aVand I met an incredibly passionate entrepreneur from Ghana.
p181
aVShe sells chocolates.
p182
aVAnd she had come to Washington,
p183
aVnot seeking a handout and not seeking a microloan.
p184
aVShe had come seeking serious investment dollars
p185
aVso that she could build the factory
p186
aVand buy the equipment she needs
p187
aVto export her chocolates
p188
aVto Africa, Europe, the Middle East
p189
aVand far beyond \u2014
p190
aVcapital that would help her to employ
p191
aVmore than the 20 people
p192
aVthat she already has working for her,
p193
aVand capital that would fuel her own country's
p194
aVeconomic climb.
p195
aa(lp196
VThe great news is
p197
aVwe already know what works.
p198
aVTheory and empirical evidence
p199
aVHave already taught us.
p200
aVWe don't need to invent solutions because we have them \u2014
p201
aVcash flow loans
p202
aVbased in income rather than assets,
p203
aVloans that use secure contracts rather than collateral,
p204
aVbecause women often don't own land.
p205
aVAnd Kiva.org, the microlender,
p206
aVis actually now experimenting with crowdsourcing
p207
aVsmall and medium sized loans.
p208
aVAnd that's just to start.
p209
aa(lp210
VRecently it has become very much in fashion
p211
aVto call women "the emerging market of the emerging market."
p212
aVI think that is terrific.
p213
aVYou know why?
p214
aVBecause \u2014 and I say this as somebody who worked in finance \u2014
p215
aV500 billion dollars at least
p216
aVhas gone into the emerging markets in the past decade.
p217
aVBecause investors saw the potential for return
p218
aVat a time of slowing economic growth,
p219
aVand so they created financial products
p220
aVand financial innovation
p221
aVtailored to the emerging markets.
p222
aa(lp223
VHow wonderful would it be
p224
aVif we were prepared to replace all of our lofty words
p225
aVwith our wallets
p226
aVand invest 500 billion dollars
p227
aVunleashing women's economic potential?
p228
aVJust think of the benefits
p229
aVwhen it comes to jobs, productivity,
p230
aVemployment, child nutrition,
p231
aVmaternal mortality, literacy
p232
aVand much, much more.
p233
aVBecause, as the World Economic Forum noted,
p234
aVsmaller gender gaps are directly correlated
p235
aVwith increased economic competitiveness.
p236
aVAnd not one country in all the world
p237
aVhas eliminated its economic participation gap \u2014
p238
aVnot one.
p239
aa(lp240
VSo the great news
p241
aVis this is an incredible opportunity.
p242
aVWe have so much room to grow.
p243
aVSo you see,
p244
aVthis is not about doing good,
p245
aVthis is about global growth
p246
aVand global employment.
p247
aVIt is about how we invest
p248
aVand it's about how we see women.
p249
aVAnd women can no longer be
p250
aVboth half the population
p251
aVand a special interest group.
p252
aa(lp253
V(Applause)
p254
aa(lp255
VOftentimes I get into very interesting discussions with reporters
p256
aVwho say to me, "Gayle, these are great stories,
p257
aVbut you're really writing about the exceptions."
p258
aVNow that makes me pause for just a couple reasons.
p259
aVFirst of all, for exceptions,
p260
aVthere are a lot of them
p261
aVand they're important.
p262
aVSecondly, when we talk about men who are succeeding,
p263
aVwe rightly consider them
p264
aVicons or pioneers or innovators
p265
aVto be emulated.
p266
aVAnd when we talk about women,
p267
aVthey are either exceptions to be dismissed
p268
aVor aberrations to be ignored.
p269
aVAnd finally,
p270
aVthere is no society anywhere in all the world
p271
aVthat is not changed
p272
aVexcept by its most exceptional.
p273
aVSo why wouldn't we celebrate and elevate
p274
aVthese change makers and job creators
p275
aVrather than overlook them?
p276
aa(lp277
VThis topic of resilience is very personal to me
p278
aVand in many ways has shaped my life.
p279
aVMy mom was a single mom
p280
aVwho worked at the phone company during the day
p281
aVand sold Tupperware at night
p282
aVso that I could have every opportunity possible.
p283
aVWe shopped double coupons
p284
aVand layaway and consignment stores,
p285
aVand when she got sick with stage four breast cancer
p286
aVand could no longer work,
p287
aVwe even applied for food stamps.
p288
aVAnd when I would feel sorry for myself
p289
aVas nine or 10 year-old girls do,
p290
aVshe would say to me, "My dear, on a scale of major world tragedies,
p291
aVyours is not a three."
p292
aa(lp293
V(Laughter)
p294
aa(lp295
VAnd when I was applying to business school
p296
aVand felt certain I couldn't do it
p297
aVand nobody I knew had done it,
p298
aVI went to my aunt who survived years of beatings at the hand of her husband
p299
aVand escaped a marriage of abuse
p300
aVwith only her dignity intact.
p301
aVAnd she told me,
p302
aV"Never import other people's limitations."
p303
aa(lp304
VAnd when I complained to my grandmother,
p305
aVa World War II veteran
p306
aVwho worked in film for 50 years
p307
aVand who supported me from the age of 13,
p308
aVthat I was terrified
p309
aVthat if I turned down a plum assignment at ABC
p310
aVfor a fellowship overseas,
p311
aVI would never ever, ever find another job,
p312
aVshe said, "Kiddo, I'm going to tell you two things.
p313
aVFirst of all, no one turns down a Fulbright,
p314
aVand secondly, McDonald's is always hiring."
p315
aV(Laughter)
p316
aV"You will find a job. Take the leap."
p317
aa(lp318
VThe women in my family
p319
aVare not exceptions.
p320
aVThe women in this room and watching in L.A.
p321
aVand all around the world
p322
aVare not exceptions.
p323
aVWe are not a special interest group.
p324
aVWe are the majority.
p325
aVAnd for far too long,
p326
aVwe have underestimated ourselves
p327
aVand been undervalued by others.
p328
aVIt is time for us to aim higher
p329
aVwhen it comes to women,
p330
aVto invest more and to deploy our dollars
p331
aVto benefit women all around the world.
p332
aa(lp333
VWe can make a difference,
p334
aVand make a difference, not just for women,
p335
aVbut for a global economy
p336
aVthat desperately needs their contributions.
p337
aVTogether we can make certain
p338
aVthat the so-called exceptions
p339
aVbegin to rule.
p340
aVWhen we change the way we see ourselves,
p341
aVothers will follow.
p342
aVAnd it is time for all of us
p343
aVto think bigger.
p344
