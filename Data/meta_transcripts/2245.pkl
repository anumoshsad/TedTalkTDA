VYou may not realize this,
p4
aVbut there are more bacteria in your body than stars in our entire galaxy.
p5
aVThis fascinating universe of bacteria inside of us
p6
aVis an integral part of our health,
p7
aVand our technology is evolving so rapidly
p8
aVthat today we can program these bacteria like we program computers.
p9
aa(lp10
VNow, the diagram that you see here,
p11
aVI know it looks like some kind of sports play,
p12
aVbut it is actually a blueprint of the first bacterial program I developed.
p13
aVAnd like writing software, we can print and write DNA
p14
aVinto different algorithms and programs inside of bacteria.
p15
aVWhat this program does is produces fluorescent proteins
p16
aVin a rhythmic fashion
p17
aVand generates a small molecule
p18
aVthat allows bacteria to communicate and synchronize,
p19
aVas you're seeing in this movie.
p20
aVThe growing colony of bacteria that you see here
p21
aVis about the width of a human hair.
p22
aVNow, what you can't see is that our genetic program
p23
aVinstructs these bacteria to each produce small molecules,
p24
aVand these molecules travel between the thousands of individual bacteria
p25
aVtelling them when to turn on and off.
p26
aVAnd the bacteria synchronize quite well at this scale,
p27
aVbut because the molecule that synchronizes them together can only travel so fast,
p28
aVin larger colonies of bacteria, this results in traveling waves
p29
aVbetween bacteria that are far away from each other,
p30
aVand you can see these waves going from right to left across the screen.
p31
aa(lp32
VNow, our genetic program relies on a natural phenomenon
p33
aVcalled quorum sensing,
p34
aVin which bacteria trigger coordinated and sometimes virulent behaviors
p35
aVonce they reach a critical density.
p36
aVYou can observe quorum sensing in action in this movie,
p37
aVwhere a growing colony of bacteria only begins to glow
p38
aVonce it reaches a high or critical density.
p39
aVOur genetic program
p40
aVcontinues producing these rhythmic patterns of fluorescent proteins
p41
aVas the colony grows outwards.
p42
aVThis particular movie and experiment we call The Supernova,
p43
aVbecause it looks like an exploding star.
p44
aa(lp45
VNow, besides programming these beautiful patterns,
p46
aVI wondered, what else can we get these bacteria to do?
p47
aVAnd I decided to explore how we can program bacteria
p48
aVto detect and treat diseases in our bodies like cancer.
p49
aVOne of the surprising facts about bacteria
p50
aVis that they can naturally grow inside of tumors.
p51
aVThis happens because typically tumors
p52
aVare areas where the immune system has no access,
p53
aVand so bacteria find these tumors
p54
aVand use them as a safe haven to grow and thrive.
p55
aVWe started using probiotic bacteria
p56
aVwhich are safe bacteria that have a health benefit,
p57
aVand found that when orally delivered to mice,
p58
aVthese probiotics would selectively grow inside of liver tumors.
p59
aVWe realized that the most convenient way
p60
aVto highlight the presence of the probiotics,
p61
aVand hence, the presence of the tumors,
p62
aVwas to get these bacteria to produce a signal
p63
aVthat would be detectable in the urine,
p64
aVand so we specifically programmed these probiotics
p65
aVto make a molecule that would change the color of your urine
p66
aVto indicate the presence of cancer.
p67
aVWe went on to show that this technology
p68
aVcould sensitively and specifically detect liver cancer,
p69
aVone that is challenging to detect otherwise.
p70
aa(lp71
VNow, since these bacteria specifically localize to tumors,
p72
aVwe've been programming them to not only detect cancer
p73
aVbut also to treat cancer
p74
aVby producing therapeutic molecules from within the tumor environment
p75
aVthat shrink the existing tumors,
p76
aVand we've been doing this using quorum sensing programs
p77
aVlike you saw in the previous movies.
p78
aa(lp79
VAltogether, imagine in the future taking a programmed probiotic
p80
aVthat could detect and treat cancer,
p81
aVor even other diseases.
p82
aVOur ability to program bacteria
p83
aVand program life
p84
aVopens up new horizons in cancer research,
p85
aVand to share this vision, I worked with artist Vik Muniz
p86
aVto create the symbol of the universe,
p87
aVmade entirely out of bacteria or cancer cells.
p88
aVUltimately, my hope is that the beauty and purpose of this microscopic universe
p89
aVcan inspire new and creative approaches for the future of cancer research.
