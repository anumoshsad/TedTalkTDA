VThere's a beautiful statement on the screen that says,
p4
aV"Light creates ambiance, light makes the feel of a space,
p5
aVand light is also the expression of structure."
p6
aVWell, that was not by me.
p7
aVThat was, of course, by Le Corbusier, the famous architect.
p8
aVAnd here you can see what he meant in one of his beautiful buildings \u2014
p9
aVthe chapel Notre Dame Du Haut De Ronchamp \u2014
p10
aVwhere he creates this light that he could only make because there's also dark.
p11
aVAnd I think that is the quintessence of this 18-minute talk \u2014
p12
aVthat there is no good lighting that is healthy and for our well-being
p13
aVwithout proper darkness.
p14
aa(lp15
VSo this is how we normally would light our offices.
p16
aVWe have codes and standards that tell us that the lights should be so much Lux
p17
aVand of great uniformity.
p18
aVThis is how we create uniform lighting from one wall to the other
p19
aVin a regular grid of lamps.
p20
aVAnd that is quite different from what I just showed you
p21
aVfrom Le Corbusier.
p22
aVIf we would apply these codes and standards
p23
aVto the Pantheon in Rome,
p24
aVit would never have looked like this,
p25
aVbecause this beautiful light feature that goes around there all by itself
p26
aVcan only appear because there is also darkness in that same building.
p27
aVAnd the same is more or less what Santiago Calatrava said
p28
aVwhen he said, "Light: I make it in my buildings for comfort."
p29
aVAnd he didn't mean the comfort of a five-course dinner
p30
aVas opposed to a one-course meal,
p31
aVbut he really meant the comfort
p32
aVof the quality of the building for the people.
p33
aVHe meant that you can see the sky and that you can experience the sun.
p34
aVAnd he created these gorgeous buildings where you can see the sky,
p35
aVand where you can experience the sun,
p36
aVthat give us a better life in the built environment,
p37
aVjust because of the relevance of light in its brightness and also in its shadows.
p38
aa(lp39
VAnd what it all boils down to is, of course, the sun.
p40
aVAnd this image of the Sun may suggest
p41
aVthat the Sun is something evil and aggressive,
p42
aVbut we should not forget
p43
aVthat all energy on this planet actually comes from the Sun,
p44
aVand light is only a manifestation of that energy.
p45
aa(lp46
VThe sun is for dynamics, for color changes.
p47
aVThe sun is for beauty in our environment,
p48
aVlike in this building \u2014 the High Museum in Atlanta,
p49
aVwhich has been created by Renzo Piano from Italy,
p50
aVtogether with Arup Lighting, a brilliant team of lighting designers,
p51
aVwho created a very subtle modulation of light across the space,
p52
aVresponding to what the sun does outside,
p53
aVjust because of all these beautiful openings in the roof.
p54
aVSo in an indirect way, you can see the sun.
p55
aVAnd what they did is they created an integral building element
p56
aVto improve the quality of the space that surrounds the visitors of the museum.
p57
aVThey created this shade that you can see here,
p58
aVwhich actually covers the sun,
p59
aVbut opens up to the good light from the sky.
p60
aVAnd here you can see how they really crafted a beautiful design process
p61
aVwith physical models,
p62
aVwith quantitative as well as qualitative methods,
p63
aVto come to a final solution that is truly integrated
p64
aVand completely holistic with the architecture.
p65
aVThey allowed themselves a few mistakes along the way.
p66
aVAs you can see here, there's some direct light on the floor,
p67
aVbut they could easily figure out where that comes from.
p68
aVAnd they allow people in that building to really enjoy the sun,
p69
aVthe good part of the sun.
p70
aa(lp71
VAnd enjoying the sun can be in many different ways, of course.
p72
aVIt can be just like this,
p73
aVor maybe like this, which is rather peculiar,
p74
aVbut this is in 1963 \u2014
p75
aVthe viewing of a sun eclipse in the United States.
p76
aVAnd it's just a bit bright up there,
p77
aVso these people have found a very intriguing solution.
p78
aVThis is, I think, a very illustrative image of what I try to say \u2014
p79
aVthat the beautiful dynamics of sun, bringing these into the building,
p80
aVcreates a quality of our built environment that truly enhances our lives.
p81
aVAnd this is all about darkness
p82
aVas much as it is about lightness, of course,
p83
aVbecause otherwise you don't see these dynamics.
p84
aa(lp85
VAs opposed to the first office
p86
aVthat I showed you in the beginning of the talk,
p87
aVthis is a well-known office, which is the Weidt Group.
p88
aVThey are in green energy consulting, or something like that.
p89
aVAnd they really practice what they preach
p90
aVbecause this office doesn't have any electric lighting at all.
p91
aVIt has only, on one side, this big, big glass window
p92
aVthat helps to let the sunlight enter deep into the space
p93
aVand create a beautiful quality there and a great dynamic range.
p94
aVSo it can be very dim over there, and you do your work,
p95
aVand it can be very bright over there, and you do your work.
p96
aVBut actually, the human eye turns out to be remarkably adaptable
p97
aVto all these different light conditions that together create an environment
p98
aVthat is never boring and that is never dull,
p99
aVand therefore helps us to enhance our lives.
p100
aa(lp101
VI really owe a short introduction of this man to you.
p102
aVThis is Richard Kelly who was born 100 years ago,
p103
aVwhich is the reason I bring him up now, because it's kind of an anniversary year.
p104
aVIn the 1930s, Richard Kelly was the first person to really describe
p105
aVa methodology of modern lighting design.
p106
aVAnd he coined three terms,
p107
aVwhich are "focal glow," "ambient luminescence"
p108
aVand "play of the brilliants" \u2014
p109
aVthree very distinctly different ideas about light in architecture
p110
aVthat all together make up this beautiful experience.
p111
aa(lp112
VSo to begin with, focal glow.
p113
aVHe meant something like this \u2014
p114
aVwhere the light gives direction to the space
p115
aVand helps you to get around.
p116
aVOr something like this,
p117
aVwhich is the lighting design he did for General Motors,
p118
aVfor the car showroom.
p119
aVAnd you enter that space,
p120
aVand you feel like, "Wow! This is so impressive,"
p121
aVjust because of this focal point, this huge light source in the middle.
p122
aVTo me, it is something from theater,
p123
aVand I will get back to that a little bit later.
p124
aVIt's the spotlight on the artist that helps you to focus.
p125
aVIt could also be the sunlight that breaks through the clouds
p126
aVand lights up a patch of the land,
p127
aVhighlighting it compared to the dim environment.
p128
aVOr it can be in today's retail, in the shopping environment \u2014
p129
aVlighting the merchandise and creating accents that help you to get around.
p130
aa(lp131
VAmbient luminescence is something very different.
p132
aVRichard Kelly saw it as something infinite,
p133
aVsomething without any focus,
p134
aVsomething where all details actually dissolve in infinity.
p135
aVAnd I see it as a very comfortable kind of light that really helps us to relax
p136
aVand to contemplate.
p137
aVIt could also be something like this:
p138
aVthe National Museum of Science in London,
p139
aVwhere this blue is embracing all the exhibitions and galleries
p140
aVin one large gesture.
p141
aa(lp142
VAnd then finally,
p143
aVKelly's play of brilliants added to that
p144
aVreally some play, I think, of the skyline of Hong Kong,
p145
aVor perhaps the chandelier in the opera house,
p146
aVor in the theater here,
p147
aVwhich is the decoration, the icing on the cake, something playful,
p148
aVsomething that is just an addition to the architectural environment,
p149
aVI would say.
p150
aVThese three distinct elements, together,
p151
aVmake a lighting environment that helps us to feel better.
p152
aVAnd we can only create these out of darkness.
p153
aVAnd I will explain that further.
p154
aVAnd I guess that is something that Richard Kelly, here on the left,
p155
aVwas explaining to Ludwig Mies van Der Rohe.
p156
aVAnd behind them, you see that Seagram Building
p157
aVthat later turned into an icon of modern lighting design.
p158
aa(lp159
VThose times, there were some early attempts
p160
aValso for light therapy already.
p161
aVYou can see here a photo
p162
aVfrom the United States Library of Medicine,
p163
aVwhere people are put in the sun to get better.
p164
aVIt's a little bit of a different story, this health aspect of light,
p165
aVthan what I'm telling you today.
p166
aVIn today's modern medicine,
p167
aVthere is a real understanding of light in an almost biochemical way.
p168
aVAnd there is the idea that, when we look at things,
p169
aVit is the yellow light that helps us the most,
p170
aVthat we are the most sensitive for.
p171
aVBut our circadian rhythms,
p172
aVwhich are the rhythms that help us to wake and sleep
p173
aVand be alert and relaxed and so forth and so on,
p174
aVthey are much more triggered by blue light.
p175
aVAnd by modulating the amount of blue in our environment,
p176
aVwe can help people to relax, or to be alert,
p177
aVto fall asleep, or to stay awake.
p178
aa(lp179
VAnd that is how, maybe in the near future, light can help hospitals
p180
aVto make people better sooner, recover them quicker.
p181
aVMaybe in the airplane, we can overcome jet lag like that.
p182
aVPerhaps in school, we can help children to learn better
p183
aVbecause they concentrate more on their work.
p184
aVAnd you can imagine a lot more applications.
p185
aVBut I would like to talk further
p186
aVabout the combination of light and darkness
p187
aVas a quality in our life.
p188
aa(lp189
VSo light is, of course, for social interaction also \u2014
p190
aVto create relationships with all the features around us.
p191
aVIt is the place where we gather around
p192
aVwhen we have to say something to each other.
p193
aVAnd it is all about this planet.
p194
aVBut when you look at this planet at night,
p195
aVit looks like this.
p196
aVAnd I think this is the most shocking image in my talk today.
p197
aVBecause all this light here goes up to the sky.
p198
aVIt never reaches the ground where it was meant for.
p199
aVIt never is to the benefit of people.
p200
aVIt only spoils the darkness.
p201
aVSo at a global scale, it looks like this.
p202
aVAnd, I mean, that is quite amazing, what you see here \u2014
p203
aVhow much light goes up into the sky and never reaches the ground.
p204
aVBecause if we look at the Earth the way it should be,
p205
aVit would be something like this very inspiring image
p206
aVwhere darkness is for our imagination and for contemplation
p207
aVand to help us to relate to everything.
p208
aa(lp209
VThe world is changing though,
p210
aVand urbanization is a big driver of everything.
p211
aVI took this photo two weeks ago in Guangzhou,
p212
aVand I realized that 10 years ago,
p213
aVthere was nothing like this, of these buildings.
p214
aVIt was just a much smaller city,
p215
aVand the pace of urbanization is incredible and enormous.
p216
aVAnd we have to understand these main questions:
p217
aVHow do people move through these new urban spaces?
p218
aVHow do they share their culture?
p219
aVHow do we tackle things like mobility?
p220
aVAnd how can light help there?
p221
aVBecause the new technologies,
p222
aVthey seem to be in a really interesting position
p223
aVto contribute to the solutions of urbanization
p224
aVand to provide us with better environments.
p225
aa(lp226
VIt's not that long ago
p227
aVthat our lighting was just done with these kinds of lamps.
p228
aVAnd of course, we had the metal-halide lamps
p229
aVand fluorescent lamps and things like that.
p230
aVNow we have LED,
p231
aVbut here you see the latest one, and you see how incredibly small it is.
p232
aVAnd this is exactly what offers us a unique opportunity,
p233
aVbecause this tiny, tiny size allows us
p234
aVto put the light wherever we really need it.
p235
aVAnd we can actually leave it out where it's not needed at all
p236
aVand where we can preserve darkness.
p237
aVSo that is a really interesting proposition, I think,
p238
aVand a new way of lighting the architectural environment
p239
aVwith our well-being in mind.
p240
aVThe problem is, though, that I wanted to explain to you how this really works \u2014
p241
aVbut I can have four of these on my finger,
p242
aVso you would not be able to really see them.
p243
aVSo I asked our laboratory to do something about it,
p244
aVand they said, "Well, we can do something."
p245
aVThey created for me the biggest LED in the world
p246
aVespecially for TEDx in Amsterdam.
p247
aa(lp248
VSo here it is.
p249
aVIt's the same thing as you can see over there \u2014
p250
aVjust 200 times bigger.
p251
aVAnd I will very quickly show you how it works.
p252
aVSo just to explain.
p253
aVNow, every LED that is made these days gives blue light.
p254
aVNow, this is not very pleasant and comfortable.
p255
aVAnd for that reason, we cover the LED with a phosphor cap.
p256
aVAnd the phosphor is excited by the blue
p257
aVand makes the light white and warm and pleasant.
p258
aVAnd then when you add the lens to that,
p259
aVyou can bundle the light and send it wherever you need it
p260
aVwithout any need to spill any light to the sky or anywhere else.
p261
aVSo you can preserve the darkness and make the light.
p262
aVI just wanted to show that to you so you understand how this works.
p263
aa(lp264
V(Applause)
p265
aa(lp266
VThank you.
p267
aa(lp268
V(Applause)
p269
aa(lp270
VWe can go further.
p271
aVSo we have to rethink the way we light our cities.
p272
aVWe have to think again about light as a default solution.
p273
aVWhy are all these motorways permanently lit?
p274
aVIs it really needed?
p275
aVCan we maybe be much more selective
p276
aVand create better environments that also benefit from darkness?
p277
aVCan we be much more gentle with light?
p278
aVLike here \u2014 this is a very low light level actually.
p279
aVCan we engage people more in the lighting projects that we create,
p280
aVso they really want to connect with it, like here?
p281
aVOr can we create simply sculptures
p282
aVthat are very inspiring to be in and to be around?
p283
aVAnd can we preserve the darkness?
p284
aVBecause to find a place like this today on Earth
p285
aVis really very, very challenging.
p286
aVAnd to find a starry sky like this is even more difficult.
p287
aa(lp288
VEven in the oceans, we are creating a lot of light
p289
aVthat we could actually ban
p290
aValso for animal life to have a much greater well-being.
p291
aVAnd it's known that migrating birds, for example, get very disoriented
p292
aVbecause of these offshore platforms.
p293
aVAnd we discovered that when we make those lights green,
p294
aVthe birds, they actually go the right way.
p295
aVThey are not disturbed anymore.
p296
aVAnd it turns out once again
p297
aVthat spectral sensitivity is very important here.
p298
aa(lp299
VIn all of these examples, I think,
p300
aVwe should start making the light out of darkness,
p301
aVand use the darkness as a canvas \u2014 like the visual artists do,
p302
aVlike Edward Hopper in this painting.
p303
aVI think that there is a lot of suspense in this painting.
p304
aVI think, when I see it, I start to think, who are those people?
p305
aVWhere have they come from? Where are they going?
p306
aVWhat just happened?
p307
aVWhat will be happening in the next five minutes?
p308
aVAnd it only embodies all these stories and all this suspense
p309
aVbecause of the darkness and the light.
p310
aa(lp311
VEdward Hopper was a real master
p312
aVin creating the narration by working with light and dark.
p313
aVAnd we can learn from that
p314
aVand create more interesting and inspiring architectural environments.
p315
aVWe can do that in commercial spaces like this.
p316
aVAnd you can still also go outside
p317
aVand enjoy the greatest show in the universe,
p318
aVwhich is, of course, the universe itself.
p319
aVSo I give you this wonderful, informative image of the sky,
p320
aVranging from the inner city,
p321
aVwhere you may see one or two stars and nothing else,
p322
aVall the way to the rural environments,
p323
aVwhere you can enjoy this great and gorgeous and beautiful performance
p324
aVof the constellations and the stars.
p325
aa(lp326
VIn architecture, it works just the same.
p327
aVBy appreciating the darkness when you design the light,
p328
aVyou create much more interesting environments
p329
aVthat truly enhance our lives.
p330
aVThis is the most well-known example, Tadao Ando's Church of the Light.
p331
aVBut I also think of Peter Zumthor's spa in Vals,
p332
aVwhere light and dark, in very gentle combinations,
p333
aValter each other to define the space.
p334
aVOr Richard MacCormac's Southwark tube station in London,
p335
aVwhere you can really see the sky, even though you are under the ground.
p336
aa(lp337
VAnd finally, I want to point out
p338
aVthat a lot of this inspiration comes from theater.
p339
aVAnd I think it's fantastic that we are today experiencing TEDx
p340
aVin a theater for the first time
p341
aVbecause I think we really owe to the theater a big thanks.
p342
aVIt wouldn't be such an inspiring scenography
p343
aVwithout this theater.
p344
aVAnd I think the theater is a place where we truly enhance life with light.
p345
aa(lp346
VThank you very much.
