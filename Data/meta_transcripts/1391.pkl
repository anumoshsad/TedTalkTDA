(lp3
VI'm going to tell you a little bit about my TEDxHouston Talk.
p4
aVI woke up the morning after I gave that talk
p5
aVwith the worst vulnerability hangover of my life.
p6
aVAnd I actually didn't leave my house for about three days.
p7
aa(lp8
VThe first time I left was to meet a friend for lunch.
p9
aVAnd when I walked in, she was already at the table.
p10
aVI sat down, and she said, "God, you look like hell."
p11
aVI said, "Thanks. I feel really \u2014
p12
aVI'm not functioning."
p13
aVAnd she said, "What's going on?"
p14
aVAnd I said, "I just told 500 people
p15
aVthat I became a researcher to avoid vulnerability.
p16
aVAnd that when being vulnerable emerged from my data,
p17
aVas absolutely essential to whole-hearted living,
p18
aVI told these 500 people that I had a breakdown.
p19
aVI had a slide that said 'Breakdown.'
p20
aVAt what point did I think that was a good idea?"
p21
aa(lp22
V(Laughter)
p23
aa(lp24
VAnd she said, "I saw your talk live-streamed.
p25
aVIt was not really you.
p26
aVIt was a little different than what you usually do.
p27
aVBut it was great."
p28
aVAnd I said,
p29
aV"This can't happen.
p30
aVYouTube, they're putting this thing on YouTube.
p31
aVAnd we're going to be talking about 600, 700 people."
p32
aa(lp33
V(Laughter)
p34
aa(lp35
VAnd she said, "Well, I think it's too late."
p36
aa(lp37
VAnd I said, "Let me ask you something."
p38
aVAnd she said, "Yeah."
p39
aVI said, "Do you remember when we were in college,
p40
aVreally wild and kind of dumb?"
p41
aVShe said, "Yeah."
p42
aVI said, "Remember when we'd leave a really bad message
p43
aVon our ex-boyfriend's answering machine?
p44
aVThen we'd have to break into his dorm room and then erase the tape?"
p45
aa(lp46
V(Laughter)
p47
aa(lp48
VAnd she goes, "Uh... no."
p49
aa(lp50
V(Laughter)
p51
aa(lp52
VOf course, the only thing I could say at that point was,
p53
aV"Yeah, me neither.
p54
aVYeah \u2014 me neither."
p55
aa(lp56
VAnd I'm thinking to myself,
p57
aV"Brené, what are you doing?
p58
aVWhy did you bring this up?
p59
aVHave you lost your mind?
p60
aVYour sisters would be perfect for this."
p61
aa(lp62
V(Laughter)
p63
aa(lp64
VSo I looked back up and she said,
p65
aV"Are you really going to try to break in and steal the video
p66
aVbefore they put it on YouTube?"
p67
aa(lp68
V(Laughter)
p69
aa(lp70
VAnd I said, "I'm just thinking about it a little bit."
p71
aa(lp72
V(Laughter)
p73
aa(lp74
VShe said, "You're like the worst vulnerability role model ever."
p75
aa(lp76
V(Laughter)
p77
aa(lp78
VThen I looked at her and I said something
p79
aVthat at the time felt a little dramatic,
p80
aVbut ended up being more prophetic than dramatic.
p81
aV"If 500 turns into 1,000
p82
aVor 2,000,
p83
aVmy life is over."
p84
aa(lp85
V(Laughter)
p86
aa(lp87
VI had no contingency plan for four million.
p88
aa(lp89
V(Laughter)
p90
aa(lp91
VAnd my life did end when that happened.
p92
aVAnd maybe the hardest part about my life ending
p93
aVis that I learned something hard about myself,
p94
aVand that was that,
p95
aVas much as I would be frustrated
p96
aVabout not being able to get my work out to the world,
p97
aVthere was a part of me that was working very hard
p98
aVto engineer staying small,
p99
aVstaying right under the radar.
p100
aVBut I want to talk about what I've learned.
p101
aa(lp102
VThere's two things that I've learned in the last year.
p103
aVThe first is:
p104
aVvulnerability is not weakness.
p105
aVAnd that myth is profoundly dangerous.
p106
aVLet me ask you honestly \u2014
p107
aVand I'll give you this warning,
p108
aVI'm trained as a therapist,
p109
aVso I can out-wait you uncomfortably \u2014
p110
aVso if you could just raise your hand that would be awesome \u2014
p111
aVhow many of you honestly,
p112
aVwhen you're thinking about doing or saying something vulnerable
p113
aVthink, "God, vulnerability is weakness."
p114
aVHow many of you think of vulnerability and weakness synonymously?
p115
aVThe majority of people.
p116
aVNow let me ask you this question:
p117
aVThis past week at TED,
p118
aVhow many of you, when you saw vulnerability up here,
p119
aVthought it was pure courage?
p120
aVVulnerability is not weakness.
p121
aVI define vulnerability as emotional risk,
p122
aVexposure, uncertainty.
p123
aVIt fuels our daily lives.
p124
aVAnd I've come to the belief \u2014
p125
aVthis is my 12th year doing this research \u2014
p126
aVthat vulnerability is our most accurate measurement of courage \u2014
p127
aVto be vulnerable, to let ourselves be seen,
p128
aVto be honest.
p129
aa(lp130
VOne of the weird things that's happened is, after the TED explosion,
p131
aVI got a lot of offers to speak all over the country \u2014
p132
aVeveryone from schools and parent meetings
p133
aVto Fortune 500 companies.
p134
aVAnd so many of the calls went like this,
p135
aV"Dr. Brown, we loved your TED talk.
p136
aVWe'd like you to come in and speak.
p137
aVWe'd appreciate it
p138
aVif you wouldn't mention vulnerability or shame."
p139
aa(lp140
V(Laughter)
p141
aa(lp142
VWhat would you like for me to talk about?
p143
aVThere's three big answers.
p144
aVThis is mostly, to be honest with you, from the business sector:
p145
aVinnovation, creativity and change.
p146
aa(lp147
V(Laughter)
p148
aa(lp149
VSo let me go on the record and say,
p150
aVvulnerability is the birthplace of innovation, creativity and change.
p151
aa(lp152
V(Applause)
p153
aa(lp154
VTo create is to make something that has never existed before.
p155
aVThere's nothing more vulnerable than that.
p156
aVAdaptability to change is all about vulnerability.
p157
aa(lp158
VThe second thing,
p159
aVin addition to really finally understanding
p160
aVthe relationship between vulnerability and courage,
p161
aVthe second thing I learned, is this:
p162
aVWe have to talk about shame.
p163
aVAnd I'm going to be really honest with you.
p164
aVWhen I became a "vulnerability researcher"
p165
aVand that became the focus because of the TED talk \u2014
p166
aVand I'm not kidding.
p167
aa(lp168
VI'll give you an example.
p169
aVAbout three months ago, I was in a sporting goods store
p170
aVbuying goggles and shin guards
p171
aVand all the things that parents buy at the sporting goods store.
p172
aVAbout from a hundred feet away, this is what I hear:
p173
aV"Vulnerability TED! Vulnerability TED!"
p174
aa(lp175
V(Laughter)
p176
aa(lp177
V(Laughter ends)
p178
aa(lp179
VI'm a fifth-generation Texan.
p180
aVOur family motto is "Lock and load."
p181
aVI am not a natural vulnerability researcher.
p182
aVSo I'm like,
p183
aVjust keep walking, she's on my six.
p184
aa(lp185
V(Laughter)
p186
aa(lp187
VAnd then I hear, "Vulnerability TED!"
p188
aVI turn around, I go, "Hi."
p189
aVShe's right here and she said,
p190
aV"You're the shame researcher who had the breakdown."
p191
aa(lp192
V(Laughter)
p193
aa(lp194
VAt this point, parents are, like, pulling their children close.
p195
aa(lp196
V(Laughter)
p197
aa(lp198
V"Look away."
p199
aVAnd I'm so worn out at this point in my life,
p200
aVI look at her and I actually say,
p201
aV"It was a fricking spiritual awakening."
p202
aa(lp203
V(Laughter)
p204
aa(lp205
V(Applause)
p206
aa(lp207
VAnd she looks back and does this,
p208
aV"I know."
p209
aa(lp210
V(Laughter)
p211
aa(lp212
VAnd she said,
p213
aV"We watched your TED talk in my book club.
p214
aVThen we read your book and we renamed ourselves
p215
aV'The Breakdown Babes.'"
p216
aa(lp217
V(Laughter)
p218
aa(lp219
VAnd she said, "Our tagline is:
p220
aV'We're falling apart and it feels fantastic.'"
p221
aa(lp222
V(Laughter)
p223
aa(lp224
VYou can only imagine what it's like for me in a faculty meeting.
p225
aa(lp226
V(Sighs)
p227
aa(lp228
VSo when I became Vulnerability TED,
p229
aVlike an action figure \u2014
p230
aVLike Ninja Barbie, but I'm Vulnerability TED \u2014
p231
aVI thought, I'm going to leave that shame stuff behind,
p232
aVbecause I spent six years studying shame
p233
aVbefore I started writing and talking about vulnerability.
p234
aVAnd I thought, thank God, because shame is this horrible topic,
p235
aVno one wants to talk about it.
p236
aVIt's the best way to shut people down on an airplane.
p237
aV"What do you do?" "I study shame." "Oh."
p238
aa(lp239
V(Laughter)
p240
aa(lp241
VAnd I see you.
p242
aa(lp243
V(Laughter)
p244
aa(lp245
VBut in surviving this last year,
p246
aVI was reminded of a cardinal rule \u2014
p247
aVnot a research rule,
p248
aVbut a moral imperative from my upbringing \u2014
p249
aV"you've got to dance with the one who brung ya".
p250
aVAnd I did not learn about vulnerability
p251
aVand courage and creativity and innovation
p252
aVfrom studying vulnerability.
p253
aVI learned about these things from studying shame.
p254
aVAnd so I want to walk you in to shame.
p255
aVJungian analysts call shame the swampland of the soul.
p256
aVAnd we're going to walk in.
p257
aVAnd the purpose is not to walk in
p258
aVand construct a home and live there.
p259
aVIt is to put on some galoshes \u2014
p260
aVand walk through and find our way around.
p261
aVHere's why.
p262
aa(lp263
VWe heard the most compelling call ever to have a conversation in this country,
p264
aVand I think globally, around race, right?
p265
aVYes? We heard that.
p266
aVYes?
p267
aVCannot have that conversation without shame.
p268
aVBecause you cannot talk about race without talking about privilege.
p269
aVAnd when people start talking about privilege,
p270
aVthey get paralyzed by shame.
p271
aVWe heard a brilliant simple solution to not killing people in surgery,
p272
aVwhich is, have a checklist.
p273
aVYou can't fix that problem without addressing shame,
p274
aVbecause when they teach those folks how to suture,
p275
aVthey also teach them how to stitch their self-worth
p276
aVto being all-powerful.
p277
aVAnd all-powerful folks don't need checklists.
p278
aa(lp279
VAnd I had to write down the name of this TED Fellow
p280
aVso I didn't mess it up here.
p281
aVMyshkin Ingawale,
p282
aVI hope I did right by you.
p283
aa(lp284
V(Applause)
p285
aa(lp286
VI saw the TED Fellows my first day here.
p287
aVAnd he got up and he explained how he was driven to create
p288
aVsome technology to help test for anemia,
p289
aVbecause people were dying unnecessarily.
p290
aVAnd he said, "I saw this need.
p291
aVSo you know what I did? I made it."
p292
aVAnd everybody just burst into applause, and they were like "Yes!"
p293
aVAnd he said, "And it didn't work.
p294
aa(lp295
V(Laughter)
p296
aa(lp297
VAnd then I made it 32 more times,
p298
aVand then it worked."
p299
aa(lp300
VYou know what the big secret about TED is?
p301
aVI can't wait to tell people this.
p302
aVI guess I'm doing it right now.
p303
aa(lp304
V(Laughter)
p305
aa(lp306
VThis is like the failure conference.
p307
aa(lp308
V(Laughter)
p309
aa(lp310
VNo, it is.
p311
aa(lp312
V(Applause)
p313
aa(lp314
VYou know why this place is amazing?
p315
aVBecause very few people here are afraid to fail.
p316
aVAnd no one who gets on the stage, so far that I've seen, has not failed.
p317
aVI've failed miserably, many times.
p318
aVI don't think the world understands that,
p319
aVbecause of shame.
p320
aa(lp321
VThere's a great quote that saved me this past year
p322
aVby Theodore Roosevelt.
p323
aVA lot of people refer to it as the "Man in the Arena" quote.
p324
aVAnd it goes like this:
p325
aV"It is not the critic who counts.
p326
aVIt is not the man who sits and points out
p327
aVhow the doer of deeds could have done things better
p328
aVand how he falls and stumbles.
p329
aVThe credit goes to the man in the arena
p330
aVwhose face is marred with dust and blood and sweat.
p331
aVBut when he's in the arena,
p332
aVat best, he wins,
p333
aVand at worst, he loses,
p334
aVbut when he fails, when he loses,
p335
aVhe does so daring greatly."
p336
aa(lp337
VAnd that's what this conference, to me, is about.
p338
aVLife is about daring greatly, about being in the arena.
p339
aVWhen you walk up to that arena and you put your hand on the door,
p340
aVand you think, "I'm going in and I'm going to try this,"
p341
aVshame is the gremlin
p342
aVwho says, "Uh, uh.
p343
aVYou're not good enough.
p344
aVYou never finished that MBA. Your wife left you.
p345
aVI know your dad really wasn't in Luxembourg,
p346
aVhe was in Sing Sing.
p347
aVI know those things that happened to you growing up.
p348
aVI know you don't think
p349
aVthat you're pretty, smart, talented or powerful enough.
p350
aVI know your dad never paid attention, even when you made CFO."
p351
aVShame is that thing.
p352
aa(lp353
VAnd if we can quiet it down and walk in
p354
aVand say, "I'm going to do this,"
p355
aVwe look up and the critic that we see pointing and laughing,
p356
aV99 percent of the time is who?
p357
aVUs.
p358
aVShame drives two big tapes \u2014
p359
aV"never good enough" \u2014
p360
aVand, if you can talk it out of that one,
p361
aV"who do you think you are?"
p362
aVThe thing to understand about shame is, it's not guilt.
p363
aVShame is a focus on self, guilt is a focus on behavior.
p364
aVShame is "I am bad."
p365
aVGuilt is "I did something bad."
p366
aVHow many of you,
p367
aVif you did something that was hurtful to me,
p368
aVwould be willing to say, "I'm sorry. I made a mistake?"
p369
aVHow many of you would be willing to say that?
p370
aVGuilt: I'm sorry. I made a mistake.
p371
aVShame: I'm sorry. I am a mistake.
p372
aa(lp373
VThere's a huge difference between shame and guilt.
p374
aVAnd here's what you need to know.
p375
aVShame is highly, highly correlated
p376
aVwith addiction, depression, violence, aggression,
p377
aVbullying, suicide, eating disorders.
p378
aVAnd here's what you even need to know more.
p379
aVGuilt, inversely correlated with those things.
p380
aVThe ability to hold something we've done or failed to do
p381
aVup against who we want to be is incredibly adaptive.
p382
aVIt's uncomfortable, but it's adaptive.
p383
aa(lp384
VThe other thing you need to know about shame
p385
aVis it's absolutely organized by gender.
p386
aVIf shame washes over me and washes over Chris,
p387
aVit's going to feel the same.
p388
aVEveryone sitting in here knows the warm wash of shame.
p389
aVWe're pretty sure that the only people who don't experience shame
p390
aVare people who have no capacity for connection or empathy.
p391
aVWhich means, yes, I have a little shame;
p392
aVno, I'm a sociopath.
p393
aVSo I would opt for, yes, you have a little shame.
p394
aVShame feels the same for men and women,
p395
aVbut it's organized by gender.
p396
aa(lp397
VFor women,
p398
aVthe best example I can give you is Enjoli, the commercial.
p399
aV"I can put the wash on the line, pack the lunches, hand out the kisses
p400
aVand be at work at five to nine.
p401
aVI can bring home the bacon, fry it up in the pan
p402
aVand never let you forget you're a man."
p403
aVFor women, shame is, do it all,
p404
aVdo it perfectly
p405
aVand never let them see you sweat.
p406
aVI don't know how much perfume that commercial sold,
p407
aVbut I guarantee you,
p408
aVit moved a lot of antidepressants and anti-anxiety meds.
p409
aa(lp410
V(Laughter)
p411
aa(lp412
VShame, for women, is this web
p413
aVof unobtainable, conflicting, competing expectations
p414
aVabout who we're supposed to be.
p415
aVAnd it's a straight-jacket.
p416
aa(lp417
VFor men,
p418
aVshame is not a bunch of competing, conflicting expectations.
p419
aVShame is one,
p420
aVdo not be perceived as what?
p421
aVWeak.
p422
aVI did not interview men for the first four years of my study.
p423
aVIt wasn't until a man looked at me after a book signing, and said,
p424
aV"I love what say about shame,
p425
aVI'm curious why you didn't mention men."
p426
aVAnd I said, "I don't study men."
p427
aVAnd he said, "That's convenient."
p428
aa(lp429
V(Laughter)
p430
aa(lp431
VAnd I said, "Why?"
p432
aVAnd he said, "Because you say to reach out,
p433
aVtell our story,
p434
aVbe vulnerable.
p435
aVBut you see those books you just signed for my wife and my three daughters?"
p436
aVI said, "Yeah."
p437
aV"They'd rather me die on top of my white horse
p438
aVthan watch me fall down.
p439
aVWhen we reach out and be vulnerable,
p440
aVwe get the shit beat out of us.
p441
aVAnd don't tell me
p442
aVit's from the guys and the coaches and the dads.
p443
aVBecause the women in my life are harder on me than anyone else."
p444
aa(lp445
VSo I started interviewing men and asking questions.
p446
aVAnd what I learned is this:
p447
aVYou show me a woman who can actually sit with a man
p448
aVin real vulnerability and fear,
p449
aVI'll show you a woman who's done incredible work.
p450
aVYou show me a man who can sit with a woman
p451
aVwho's just had it,
p452
aVshe can't do it all anymore,
p453
aVand his first response is not,
p454
aV"I unloaded the dishwasher!"
p455
aa(lp456
V(Laughter)
p457
aa(lp458
VBut he really listens \u2014
p459
aVbecause that's all we need \u2014
p460
aVI'll show you a guy who's done a lot of work.
p461
aa(lp462
VShame is an epidemic in our culture.
p463
aVAnd to get out from underneath it \u2014
p464
aVto find our way back to each other,
p465
aVwe have to understand how it affects us
p466
aVand how it affects the way we're parenting,
p467
aVthe way we're working, the way we're looking at each other.
p468
aVVery quickly, some research by Mahalik at Boston College.
p469
aVHe asked, what do women need to do to conform to female norms?
p470
aVThe top answers in this country:
p471
aVnice, thin, modest
p472
aVand use all available resources for appearance.
p473
aa(lp474
V(Laughter)
p475
aa(lp476
VWhen he asked about men,
p477
aVwhat do men in this country need to do to conform with male norms,
p478
aVthe answers were:
p479
aValways show emotional control,
p480
aVwork is first,
p481
aVpursue status and violence.
p482
aa(lp483
VIf we're going to find our way back to each other,
p484
aVwe have to understand and know empathy,
p485
aVbecause empathy's the antidote to shame.
p486
aVIf you put shame in a Petri dish,
p487
aVit needs three things to grow exponentially:
p488
aVsecrecy, silence and judgment.
p489
aVIf you put the same amount in a Petri dish and douse it with empathy,
p490
aVit can't survive.
p491
aVThe two most powerful words when we're in struggle:
p492
aVme too.
p493
aa(lp494
VAnd so I'll leave you with this thought.
p495

aVAnd I know it's seductive to stand outside the arena,
p498
aVbecause I think I did it my whole life,
p499
aVand think to myself,
p500
aVI'm going to go in there and kick some ass
p501
aVwhen I'm bulletproof and when I'm perfect.
p502
aVAnd that is seductive.
p503
aVBut the truth is, that never happens.
p504
aVAnd even if you got as perfect as you could
p505
aVand as bulletproof as you could possibly muster
p506
aVwhen you got in there,

aVWe want you to go in.
p509
aVWe want to be with you and across from you.
p510
aVAnd we just want,
p511
aVfor ourselves and the people we care about
p512
aVand the people we work with,
p513
aVto dare greatly.
