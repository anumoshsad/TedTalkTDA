VI'm a medical illustrator,
p4
aVand I come from a slightly different point of view.
p5
aVI've been watching, since I grew up,
p6
aVthe expressions of truth and beauty in the arts
p7
aVand truth and beauty in the sciences.
p8
aVAnd while these are both wonderful things in their own right \u2014
p9
aVthey both have very wonderful things going for them \u2014
p10
aVtruth and beauty as ideals that can be looked at by the sciences
p11
aVand by math are almost like the ideal conjoined twins
p12
aVthat a scientist would want to date.
p13
aV(Laughter)
p14
aVThese are expressions of truth as awe-full things,
p15
aVby meaning they are things you can worship.
p16
aVThey are ideals that are powerful. They are irreducible.
p17
aVThey are unique. They are useful \u2014
p18
aVsometimes, often a long time after the fact.
p19
aVAnd you can actually roll some of the pictures now,
p20
aVbecause I don't want to look at me on the screen.
p21
aa(lp22
VTruth and beauty are things
p23
aVthat are often opaque to people who are not in the sciences.
p24
aVThey are things that describe beauty in a way
p25
aVthat is often only accessible if you understand the language
p26
aVand the syntax of the person
p27
aVwho studies the subject in which truth and beauty is expressed.
p28
aVIf you look at the math, E=mc squared,
p29
aVif you look at the cosmological constant,
p30
aVwhere there's an anthropic ideal, where you see that life had to evolve
p31
aVfrom the numbers that describe the universe \u2014
p32
aVthese are things that are really difficult to understand.
p33
aa(lp34
VAnd what I've tried to do
p35
aVsince I had my training as a medical illustrator \u2014
p36
aVsince I was taught animation by my father,
p37
aVwho was a sculptor and my visual mentor \u2014
p38
aVI wanted to figure out a way to help people
p39
aVunderstand truth and beauty in the biological sciences
p40
aVby using animation, by using pictures, by telling stories
p41
aVso that the things that are not necessarily evident to people
p42
aVcan be brought forth, and can be taught, and can be understood.
p43
aa(lp44
VStudents today are often immersed in an environment
p45
aVwhere what they learn is subjects that have truth and beauty
p46
aVembedded in them, but the way they're taught is compartmentalized
p47
aVand it's drawn down to the point where the truth and beauty
p48
aVare not always evident.
p49
aVIt's almost like that old recipe for chicken soup
p50
aVwhere you boil the chicken until the flavor is just gone.
p51
aVWe don't want to do that to our students.
p52
aVSo we have an opportunity to really open up education.
p53
aa(lp54
VAnd I had a telephone call from Robert Lue at Harvard,
p55
aVin the Molecular and Cellular Biology Department,
p56
aVa couple of years ago. He asked me if my team and I
p57
aVwould be interested and willing to really change
p58
aVhow medical and scientific education is done at Harvard.
p59
aVSo we embarked on a project that would explore the cell \u2014
p60
aVthat would explore the truth and beauty inherent
p61
aVin molecular and cellular biology
p62
aVso that students could understand a larger picture
p63
aVthat they could hang all of these facts on.
p64
aVThey could have a mental image of the cell
p65
aVas a large, bustling, hugely complicated city
p66
aVthat's occupied by micro-machines.
p67
aa(lp68
VAnd these micro-machines really are at the heart of life.
p69
aVThese micro-machines,
p70
aVwhich are the envy of nanotechnologists the world over,
p71
aVare self-directed, powerful, precise, accurate devices
p72
aVthat are made out of strings of amino acids.
p73
aVAnd these micro-machines power how a cell moves.
p74
aVThey power how a cell replicates. They power our hearts.
p75
aVThey power our minds.
p76
aa(lp77
VAnd so what we wanted to do was to figure out
p78
aVhow we could make this story into an animation
p79
aVthat would be the centerpiece of BioVisions at Harvard,
p80
aVwhich is a website that Harvard has
p81
aVfor its molecular and cellular biology students
p82
aVthat will \u2014 in addition to all the textual information,
p83
aVin addition to all the didactic stuff \u2014
p84
aVput everything together visually, so that these students
p85
aVwould have an internalized view of what a cell really is
p86
aVin all of its truth and beauty, and be able to study
p87
aVwith this view in mind, so that their imaginations would be sparked,
p88
aVso that their passions would be sparked
p89
aVand so that they would be able to go on
p90
aVand use these visions in their head to make new discoveries
p91
aVand to be able to find out, really, how life works.
p92
aa(lp93
VSo we set out by looking at how these molecules are put together.
p94
aVWe worked with a theme, which is, you've got macrophages
p95
aVthat are streaming down a capillary,
p96
aVand they're touching the surface of the capillary wall,
p97
aVand they're picking up information from cells
p98
aVthat are on the capillary wall, and they are given this information
p99
aVthat there's an inflammation somewhere outside,
p100
aVwhere they can't see and sense.
p101
aVBut they get the information that causes them to stop,
p102
aVcauses them to internalize that they need to make
p103
aVall of the various parts that will cause them to change their shape,
p104
aVand try to get out of this capillary and find out what's going on.
p105
aa(lp106
VSo these molecular motors \u2014 we had to work
p107
aVwith the Harvard scientists and databank models
p108
aVof the atomically accurate molecules
p109
aVand figure out how they moved, and figure out what they did.
p110
aVAnd figure out how to do this in a way
p111
aVthat was truthful in that it imparted what was going on,
p112
aVbut not so truthful that the compact crowding in a cell
p113
aVwould prevent the vista from happening.
p114
aa(lp115
VAnd so what I'm going to show you is a three-minute
p116
aVReader's Digest version of the first aspect of this film
p117
aVthat we produced. It's an ongoing project
p118
aVthat's going to go another four or five years.
p119
aVAnd I want you to look at this
p120
aVand see the paths that the cell manufactures \u2014
p121
aVthese little walking machines, they're called kinesins \u2014
p122
aVthat take these huge loads
p123
aVthat would challenge an ant in relative size.
p124
aVRun the movie, please.
p125
aa(lp126
VBut these machines that power the inside of the cells
p127
aVare really quite amazing, and they really are the basis of all life
p128
aVbecause all of these machines interact with each other.
p129
aVThey pass information to each other.
p130
aVThey cause different things to happen inside the cell.
p131
aVAnd the cell will actually manufacture the parts that it needs
p132
aVon the fly, from information
p133
aVthat's brought from the nucleus by molecules that read the genes.
p134
aVNo life, from the smallest life to everybody here,
p135
aVwould be possible without these little micro-machines.
p136
aVIn fact, it would really, in the absence of these machines,
p137
aVhave made the attendance here, Chris, really quite sparse.
p138
aV(Laughter)
p139
aV(Music)
p140
aa(lp141
VThis is the FedEx delivery guy of the cell.
p142
aVThis little guy is called the kinesin,
p143
aVand he pulls a sack that's full of brand new manufactured proteins
p144
aVto wherever it's needed in the cell \u2014
p145
aVwhether it's to a membrane, whether it's to an organelle,
p146
aVwhether it's to build something or repair something.
p147
aVAnd each of us has about 100,000 of these things
p148
aVrunning around, right now,
p149
aVinside each one of your 100 trillion cells.
p150
aVSo no matter how lazy you feel,
p151
aVyou're not really intrinsically doing nothing.
p152
aV(Laughter)
p153
aa(lp154
VSo what I want you to do when you go home
p155
aVis think about this, and think about how powerful our cells are.
p156
aVAnd think about some of the things
p157
aVthat we're learning about cellular mechanics.
p158
aVOnce we figure out all that's going on \u2014
p159
aVand believe me, we know almost a percent of what's going on \u2014
p160
aVonce we figure out what's going on,
p161
aVwe're really going to be able to have a lot of control
p162
aVover what we do with our health,
p163
aVwith what we do with future generations,
p164
aVand how long we're going to live.
p165
aVAnd hopefully we'll be able to use this
p166
aVto discover more truth, and more beauty.
p167
aV(Music)
p168
aa(lp169
VBut it's really quite amazing that these cells, these micro-machines,
p170
aVare aware enough of what the cell needs that they do their bidding.
p171
aVThey work together. They make the cell do what it needs to do.
p172
aVAnd their working together helps our bodies \u2014
p173
aVhuge entities that they will never see \u2014 function properly.
p174
aVEnjoy the rest of the show. Thank you.
