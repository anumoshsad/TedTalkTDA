VDo we live in a borderless world?
p4
aVBefore you answer that, have a look at this map.
p5
aVContemporary political map shows
p6
aVthat we have over 200 countries in the world today.
p7
aVThat's probably more than at any time in centuries.
p8
aVNow, many of you will object.
p9
aVFor you this would be a more appropriate map.
p10
aVYou could call it TEDistan.
p11
aVIn TEDistan, there are no borders,
p12
aVjust connected spaces and unconnected spaces.
p13
aVMost of you probably reside in one of the 40 dots
p14
aVon this screen, of the many more
p15
aVthat represent 90 percent of the world economy.
p16
aa(lp17
VBut let's talk about the 90 percent of the world population
p18
aVthat will never leave the place in which they were born.
p19
aVFor them, nations, countries, boundaries, borders still matter a great deal,
p20
aVand often violently.
p21
aVNow here at TED, we're solving some of the great
p22
aVriddles of science and mysteries of the universe.
p23
aVWell here is a fundamental problem we have not solved:
p24
aVour basic political geography.
p25
aVHow do we distribute ourselves around the world?
p26
aa(lp27
VNow this is important, because border conflicts
p28
aVjustify so much of the world's military-industrial complex.
p29
aVBorder conflicts can derail
p30
aVso much of the progress that we hope to achieve here.
p31
aVSo I think we need a deeper understanding
p32
aVof how people, money, power,
p33
aVreligion, culture, technology
p34
aVinteract to change the map of the world.
p35
aVAnd we can try to anticipate those changes,
p36
aVand shape them in a more constructive direction.
p37
aa(lp38
VSo we're going to look at some maps of the past,
p39
aVthe present and some maps you haven't seen
p40
aVin order to get a sense of where things are going.
p41
aVLet's start with the world of 1945.
p42
aV1945 there were just 100 countries in the world.
p43
aVAfter World War II, Europe was devastated,
p44
aVbut still held large overseas colonies:
p45
aVFrench West Africa, British East Africa, South Asia, and so forth.
p46
aVThen over the late '40s,
p47
aV'50s, '60s, '70s and '80s,
p48
aVwaves of decolonization took place.
p49
aVOver 50 new countries were born.
p50
aVYou can see that Africa has been fragmented.
p51
aVIndia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, South East Asian nations created.
p52
aVThen came the end of the Cold War.
p53
aVThe end of the Cold War and the disintegration of the Soviet Union.
p54
aVYou had the creation of new states in Eastern Europe,
p55
aVthe former Yugoslav republics and the Balkans,
p56
aVand the 'stans of central Asia.
p57
aa(lp58
VToday we have 200 countries in the world.
p59
aVThe entire planet is covered
p60
aVby sovereign, independent nation-states.
p61
aVDoes that mean that someone's gain has to be someone else's loss?
p62
aVLet's zoom in on one of the most strategic areas of the world,
p63
aVEastern Eurasia.
p64
aVAs you can see on this map,
p65
aVRussia is still the largest country in the world.
p66
aVAnd as you know, China is the most populous.
p67
aVAnd they share a lengthy land border.
p68
aa(lp69
VWhat you don't see on this map
p70
aVis that most of Russia's 150 million people
p71
aVare concentrated in its western provinces
p72
aVand areas that are close to Europe.
p73
aVAnd only 30 million people are in its eastern areas.
p74
aVIn fact, the World Bank predicts
p75
aVthat Russia's population is declining
p76
aVtowards about 120 million people
p77
aa(lp78
VAnd there is another thing that you don't see on this map.
p79
aVStalin, Khrushchev and other Soviet leaders
p80
aVforced Russians out to the far east
p81
aVto be in gulags, labor camps,
p82
aVnuclear cities, whatever the case was.
p83
aVBut as oil prices rose,
p84
aVRussian governments have invested in infrastructure
p85
aVto unite the country, east and west.
p86
aVBut nothing has more perversely impacted
p87
aVRussia's demographic distribution,
p88
aVbecause the people in the east, who never wanted to be there anyway,
p89
aVhave gotten on those trains and roads
p90
aVand gone back to the west.
p91
aVAs a result, in the Russian far east today,
p92
aVwhich is twice the size of India,
p93
aVyou have exactly six million Russians.
p94
aa(lp95
VSo let's get a sense of what is happening in this part of the world.
p96
aVWe can start with Mongolia, or as some call it, Mine-golia.
p97
aVWhy do they call it that?
p98
aVBecause in Mine-golia, Chinese firms operate
p99
aVand own most of the mines \u2014 copper, zinc, gold \u2014
p100
aVand they truck the resources south and east into mainland China.
p101
aVChina isn't conquering Mongolia.
p102
aVIt's buying it.
p103
aVColonies were once conquered. Today countries are bought.
p104
aa(lp105
VSo let's apply this principle to Siberia.
p106
aVSiberia most of you probably think of
p107
aVas a cold, desolate, unlivable place.
p108
aVBut in fact, with global warming and rising temperatures,
p109
aVall of a sudden you have vast wheat fields
p110
aVand agribusiness, and grain being produced in Siberia.
p111
aVBut who is it going to feed?
p112
aVWell, just on the other side of the Amo River,
p113
aVin the Heilongjiang and Harbin provinces of China,
p114
aVyou have over 100 million people.
p115
aVThat's larger than the entire population of Russia.
p116
aa(lp117
VEvery single year, for at least a decade or more,
p118
aV[60,000] of them have been voting with their feet,
p119
aVcrossing, moving north and inhabiting this desolate terrain.
p120
aVThey set up their own bazaars and medical clinics.
p121
aVThey've taken over the timber industry
p122
aVand been shipping the lumber east, back into China.
p123
aVAgain, like Mongolia,
p124
aVChina isn't conquering Russia. It's just leasing it.
p125
aVThat's what I call globalization Chinese style.
p126
aa(lp127
VNow maybe this is what the map of the region
p128
aVmight look like in 10 to 20 years.
p129
aVBut hold on. This map is 700 years old.
p130
aVThis is the map of the Yuan Dynasty,
p131
aVled by Kublai Khan, the grandson of Genghis Khan.
p132
aVSo history doesn't necessarily repeat itself,
p133
aVbut it does rhyme.
p134
aa(lp135
VThis is just to give you a taste of what's happening in this part of the world.
p136
aVAgain, globalization Chinese style.
p137
aVBecause globalization opens up all kinds of ways for us to
p138
aVundermine and change the way we think about political geography.
p139
aVSo, the history of East Asia in fact,
p140
aVpeople don't think about nations and borders.
p141
aVThey think more in terms of empires and hierarchies,
p142
aVusually Chinese or Japanese.
p143
aa(lp144
VWell it's China's turn again.
p145
aVSo let's look at how China is re-establishing
p146
aVthat hierarchy in the far East.
p147
aVIt starts with the global hubs.
p148
aVRemember the 40 dots on the nighttime map
p149
aVthat show the hubs of the global economy?
p150
aVEast Asia today has more of those global hubs
p151
aVthan any other region in the world.
p152
aVTokyo, Seoul, Beijing, Shanghai,
p153
aVHong Kong, Singapore and Sidney.
p154
aVThese are the filters and funnels of global capital.
p155
aVTrillions of dollars a year are being brought into the region,
p156
aVso much of it being invested into China.
p157
aa(lp158
VThen there is trade.
p159
aVThese vectors and arrows represent ever stronger
p160
aVtrade relationships that China has
p161
aVwith every country in the region.
p162
aVSpecifically, it targets Japan
p163
aVand Korea and Australia,
p164
aVcountries that are strong allies of the United States.
p165
aVAustralia, for example, is heavily dependent
p166
aVon exporting iron ore and natural gas to China.
p167
aVFor poorer countries, China reduces tariffs
p168
aVso that Laos and Cambodia can sell their goods more cheaply
p169
aVand become dependent on exporting to China as well.
p170
aa(lp171
VAnd now many of you have been reading in the news
p172
aVhow people are looking to China
p173
aVto lead the rebound, the economic rebound, not just in Asia, but potentially for the world.
p174
aVThe Asian free trade zone, almost free trade zone, that's emerging
p175
aVnow has a greater trade volume than trade across the Pacific.
p176
aVSo China is becoming the anchor of the economy in the region.
p177
aa(lp178
VAnother pillar of this strategy is diplomacy.
p179
aVChina has signed military agreements with many countries in the region.
p180
aVIt has become the hub of diplomatic institutions
p181
aVsuch as the East Asian Community.
p182
aVSome of these organizations don't even have
p183
aVthe United States as a member.
p184
aVThere is a treaty of nonaggression between countries,
p185
aVsuch that if there were a conflict between China and the United States,
p186
aVmost countries vow to just sit it out,
p187
aVincluding American allies like Korea and Australia.
p188
aa(lp189
VAnother pillar of the strategy,
p190
aVlike Russia, is demographic.
p191
aVChina exports business people, nannies, students,
p192
aVteachers to teach Chinese around the region,
p193
aVto intermarry and to occupy ever greater
p194
aVcommanding heights of the economies.
p195
aVAlready ethnic Chinese people
p196
aVin Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia
p197
aVare the real key factors and drivers
p198
aVin the economies there.
p199
aVChinese pride is resurgent in the region
p200
aVas a result.
p201
aVSingapore, for example, used to ban Chinese language education.
p202
aVNow it encourages it.
p203
aa(lp204
VIf you add it all up what do you get?
p205
aVWell, if you remember before World War II,
p206
aVJapan had a vision
p207
aVfor a greater Japanese co-prosperity sphere.
p208
aVWhat's emerging today is what you might call
p209
aVa greater Chinese co-prosperity sphere.
p210
aVSo no matter what the lines on the map tell you
p211
aVin terms of nations and borders,
p212
aVwhat you really have emerging in the far east
p213
aVare national cultures,
p214
aVbut in a much more fluid, imperial zone.
p215
aVAll of this is happening without firing a shot.
p216
aa(lp217
VThat's most certainly not the case in the Middle East
p218
aVwhere countries are still very uncomfortable
p219
aVin the borders left behind by European colonialists.
p220
aVSo what can we do to think about borders differently in this part of the world?
p221
aVWhat lines on the map should we focus on?
p222
aVWhat I want to present to you is what I call
p223
aVstate building, day by day.
p224
aa(lp225
VLet's start with Iraq.
p226
aVSix years after the U.S. invasion of Iraq,
p227
aVthe country still exists more on a map than it does in reality.
p228
aVOil used to be one of the forces holding Iraq together;
p229
aVnow it is the most significant cause of the country's disintegration.
p230
aVThe reason is Kurdistan.
p231
aVThe Kurds for 3,000 years
p232
aVhave been waging a struggle for independence,
p233
aVand now is their chance to finally have it.
p234
aVThese are pipeline routes, which emerge from Kurdistan,
p235
aVwhich is an oil-rich region.
p236
aa(lp237
VAnd today, if you go to Kurdistan,
p238
aVyou'll see that Kurdish Peshmerga guerillas
p239
aVare squaring off against the Sunni Iraqi army.
p240
aVBut what are they guarding?
p241
aVIs it really a border on the map?
p242
aVNo. It's the pipelines.
p243
aVIf the Kurds can control their pipelines, they can set the terms
p244
aVof their own statehood.
p245
aVNow should we be upset about this, about the potential disintegration of Iraq?
p246
aVI don't believe we should.
p247
aVIraq will still be the second largest oil producer in the world,
p248
aVbehind Saudi Arabia.
p249
aVAnd we'll have a chance to solve a 3,000 year old dispute.
p250
aVNow remember Kurdistan is landlocked.
p251
aVIt has no choice but to behave.
p252
aVIn order to profit from its oil
p253
aVit has to export it through Turkey or Syria,
p254
aVand other countries, and Iraq itself.
p255
aVAnd therefore it has to have amicable relations with them.
p256
aa(lp257
VNow lets look at a perennial conflict in the region.
p258
aVThat is, of course, in Palestine.
p259
aVPalestine is something of a cartographic anomaly
p260
aVbecause it's two parts Palestinian, one part Israel.
p261
aV30 years of rose garden diplomacy
p262
aVhave not delivered us peace in this conflict.
p263
aVWhat might? I believe that what might
p264
aVsolve the problem is infrastructure.
p265
aVToday donors are spending billions of dollars on this.
p266
aVThese two arrows are an arc,
p267
aVan arc of commuter railroads and other infrastructure
p268
aVthat link the West Bank and Gaza.
p269
aa(lp270
VIf Gaza can have a functioning port
p271
aVand be linked to the West Bank, you can have a viable Palestinian state,
p272
aVPalestinian economy.
p273
aVThat, I believe, is going to bring peace to this particular conflict.
p274
aVThe lesson from Kurdistan and from Palestine
p275
aVis that independence alone, without infrastructure,
p276
aVis futile.
p277
aa(lp278
VNow what might this entire region look like
p279
aVif in fact we focus on other lines on the map besides borders,
p280
aVwhen the insecurities might abate?
p281
aVThe last time that was the case was actually
p282
aVa century ago, during the Ottoman Empire.
p283
aVThis is the Hejaz Railway.
p284
aVThe Hejaz Railway ran from Istanbul to Medina via Damascus.
p285
aVIt even had an offshoot running to Haifa
p286
aVin what is today Israel, on the Mediterranean Sea.
p287
aVBut today the Hejaz Railway lies in tatters, ruins.
p288
aVIf we were to focus on reconstructing these curvy lines on the map,
p289
aVinfrastructure, that cross the straight lines, the borders,
p290
aVI believe the Middle East would be a far more peaceful region.
p291
aa(lp292
VNow let's look at another part of the world,
p293
aVthe former Soviet Republics of Central Asia, the 'stans.
p294
aVThese countries' borders originate from Stalin's decrees.
p295
aVHe purposely did not want these countries to make sense.
p296
aVHe wanted ethnicities to mingle
p297
aVin ways that would allow him to divide and rule.
p298
aVFortunately for them, most of their oil and gas resources
p299
aVwere discovered after the Soviet Union collapsed.
p300
aa(lp301
VNow I know some of you may be thinking, "Oil, oil, oil.
p302
aVWhy is it all he's talking about is oil?"
p303
aVWell, there is a big difference in the way we used to talk about oil
p304
aVand the way we're talking about it now.
p305
aVBefore it was, how do we control their oil?
p306
aVNow it's their oil for their own purposes.
p307
aVAnd I assure you it's every bit as important to them
p308
aVas it might have been to colonizers and imperialists.
p309
aVHere are just some of the pipeline projections
p310
aVand possibilities and scenarios
p311
aVand routes that are being mapped out for the next several decades.
p312
aVA great deal of them.
p313
aa(lp314
VFor a number of countries in this part of the world,
p315
aVhaving pipelines is the ticket to becoming part of the global economy
p316
aVand for having some meaning
p317
aVbesides the borders that they are not loyal to themselves.
p318
aVJust take Azerbaijan.
p319
aVAzerbaijan was a forgotten corner of the Caucuses,
p320
aVbut now with the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline into Turkey,
p321
aVit has rebranded itself as the frontier of the west.
p322
aa(lp323
VThen there is Turkmenistan, which most people think of
p324
aVas a frozen basket case.
p325
aVBut now it's contributing gas across the Caspian Sea
p326
aVto provide for Europe,
p327
aVand even a potentially Turkmen-
p328
aVAfghan-Pakistan-India pipeline as well.
p329
aa(lp330
VThen there is Kazakhstan, which didn't even have a name before.
p331
aVIt was more considered South Siberia during the Soviet Union.
p332
aVToday most people recognize Kazakhstan
p333
aVas an emerging geopolitical player. Why?
p334
aVBecause it has shrewdly designed pipelines to flow across the Caspian,
p335
aVnorth through Russia, and even east to China.
p336
aVMore pipelines means more silk roads, instead of the Great Game.
p337
aVThe Great Game connotes dominance of one over the other.
p338
aVSilk road connotes independence and mutual trust.
p339
aVThe more pipelines we have, the more silk roads we'll have,
p340
aVand the less of a dominant Great Game competition
p341
aVwe'll have in the 21st century.
p342
aa(lp343
VNow let's look at the only part of the world that really has brought down its borders,
p344
aVand how that has enhanced its strength.
p345
aVAnd that is, of course, Europe.
p346
aVThe European Union began as just the coal and steel community of six countries,
p347
aVand their main purpose was really to keep the rehabilitation of Germany
p348
aVto happen in a peaceful way.
p349
aVBut then eventually it grew into 12 countries,
p350
aVand those are the 12 stars on the European flag.
p351
aVThe E.U. also became a currency block,
p352
aVand is now the most powerful trade block in the entire world.
p353
aVOn average, the E.U. has grown by one country per year
p354
aVsince the end of the Cold War.
p355
aVIn fact most of that happened on just one day.
p356
aVIn 2004, 15 new countries joined the E.U.
p357
aVand now you have what most people consider
p358
aVa zone of peace spanning 27 countries
p359
aVand 450 million people.
p360
aa(lp361
VSo what is next? What is the future of the European Union?
p362
aVWell in light blue, you see the zones
p363
aVor the regions that are at least two-thirds
p364
aVor more dependent on the European Union
p365
aVfor trade and investment.
p366
aVWhat does that tell us? Trade and investment tell us
p367
aVthat Europe is putting its money where its mouth is.
p368
aVEven if these regions aren't part of the E.U.,
p369
aVthey are becoming part of its sphere of influence.
p370
aVJust take the Balkans. Croatia, Serbia
p371
aVBosnia, they're not members of the E.U. yet.
p372
aVBut you can get on a German ICE train
p373
aVand make it almost to Albania.
p374
aVIn Bosnia you use the Euro currency already,
p375
aVand that's the only currency they're probably ever going to have.
p376
aa(lp377
VSo, looking at other parts of Europe's periphery, such as North Africa.
p378
aVOn average, every year or two,
p379
aVa new oil or gas pipeline opens up under the Mediterranean,
p380
aVconnecting North Africa to Europe.
p381
aVThat not only helps Europe diminish its reliance
p382
aVon Russia for energy,
p383
aVbut if you travel to North Africa today, you'll hear more and more people saying
p384
aVthat they don't really think of their region as the Middle East.
p385
aVSo in other words, I believe that President Sarkozy of France
p386
aVis right when he talks about a Mediterranean union.
p387
aa(lp388
VNow let's look at Turkey and the Caucasus.
p389
aVI mentioned Azerbaijan before.
p390
aVThat corridor of Turkey and the Caucasus
p391
aVhas become the conduit for 20 percent
p392
aVof Europe's energy supply.
p393
aVSo does Turkey really have to be a member of the European Union?
p394
aVI don't think it does. I think it's already part of
p395
aVa Euro-Turkish superpower.
p396
aa(lp397
VSo what's next? Where are we going to see borders change
p398
aVand new countries born?
p399
aVWell, South Central Asia, South West Asia
p400
aVis a very good place to start.
p401
aVEight years after the U.S. invaded Afghanistan
p402
aVthere is still a tremendous amount of instability.
p403
aVPakistan and Afghanistan are still so fragile
p404
aVthat neither of them have dealt constructively
p405
aVwith the problem of Pashtun nationalism.
p406
aVThis is the flag that flies in the minds
p407
aVof 20 million Pashtuns
p408
aVwho live on both sides of the Afghan and Pakistan border.
p409
aa(lp410
VLet's not neglect the insurgency just to the south,
p411
aVBalochistan. Two weeks ago,
p412
aVBalochi rebels attacked a Pakistani military garrison,
p413
aVand this was the flag that they raised over it.
p414
aVThe post-colonial entropy
p415
aVthat is happening around the world is accelerating,
p416
aVand I expect more such changes to occur in the map
p417
aVas the states fragment.
p418
aa(lp419
VOf course, we can't forget Africa.
p420
aV53 countries, and by far the most number
p421
aVof suspiciously straight lines on the map.
p422
aVIf we were to look at all of Africa
p423
aVwe could most certainly acknowledge far more,
p424
aVtribal divisions and so forth.
p425
aVBut let's just look at Sudan, the second-largest country in Africa.
p426
aVIt has three ongoing civil wars,
p427
aVthe genocide in Darfur, which you all know about,
p428
aVthe civil war in the east of the country,
p429
aVand south Sudan.
p430
aVSouth Sudan is going to be having a referendum in 2011
p431
aVin which it is very likely to vote itself independence.
p432
aa(lp433
VNow let's go up to the Arctic Circle.
p434
aVThere is a great race on for energy resources
p435
aVunder the Arctic seabed.
p436
aVWho will win? Canada? Russia? The United States?
p437
aVActually Greenland.
p438
aVSeveral weeks ago Greenland's [60,000] people
p439
aVvoted themselves self-governance rights
p440
aVfrom Denmark.
p441
aVSo Denmark is about to get a whole lot smaller.
p442
aa(lp443
VWhat is the lesson from all of this?
p444
aVGeopolitics is a very unsentimental discipline.
p445
aVIt's constantly morphing and changing the world,
p446
aVlike climate change.
p447
aVAnd like our relationship with the ecosystem
p448
