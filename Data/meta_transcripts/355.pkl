VWhat I want to tell you about today is how I see robots invading our lives
p4
aVat multiple levels, over multiple timescales.
p5
aVAnd when I look out in the future, I can't imagine a world, 500 years from now,
p6
aVwhere we don't have robots everywhere.
p7
aVAssuming \u2014 despite all the dire predictions from many people about our future \u2014
p8
aVassuming we're still around, I can't imagine the world not being populated with robots.
p9
aVAnd then the question is, well, if they're going to be here in 500 years,
p10
aVare they going to be everywhere sooner than that?
p11
aVAre they going to be around in 50 years?
p12
aVYeah, I think that's pretty likely \u2014 there's going to be lots of robots everywhere.
p13
aVAnd in fact I think that's going to be a lot sooner than that.
p14
aVI think we're sort of on the cusp of robots becoming common,
p15
aVand I think we're sort of around 1978 or 1980 in personal computer years,
p16
aVwhere the first few robots are starting to appear.
p17
aa(lp18
VComputers sort of came around through games and toys.
p19
aVAnd you know, the first computer most people had in the house
p20
aVmay have been a computer to play Pong,
p21
aVa little microprocessor embedded,
p22
aVand then other games that came after that.
p23
aVAnd we're starting to see that same sort of thing with robots:
p24
aVLEGO Mindstorms, Furbies \u2014 who here \u2014 did anyone here have a Furby?
p25
aVYeah, there's 38 million of them sold worldwide.
p26
aVThey are pretty common. And they're a little tiny robot,
p27
aVa simple robot with some sensors,
p28
aVa little bit of processing actuation.
p29
aa(lp30
VOn the right there is another robot doll, who you could get a couple of years ago.
p31
aVAnd just as in the early days,
p32
aVwhen there was a lot of sort of amateur interaction over computers,
p33
aVyou can now get various hacking kits, how-to-hack books.
p34
aVAnd on the left there is a platform from Evolution Robotics,
p35
aVwhere you put a PC on, and you program this thing with a GUI
p36
aVto wander around your house and do various stuff.
p37
aVAnd then there's a higher price point sort of robot toys \u2014
p38
aVthe Sony Aibo. And on the right there, is one that the NEC developed,
p39
aVthe PaPeRo, which I don't think they're going to release.
p40
aVBut nevertheless, those sorts of things are out there.
p41
aa(lp42
VAnd we've seen, over the last two or three years, lawn-mowing robots,
p43
aVHusqvarna on the bottom, Friendly Robotics on top there, an Israeli company.
p44
aVAnd then in the last 12 months or so
p45
aVwe've started to see a bunch of home-cleaning robots appear.
p46
aVThe top left one is a very nice home-cleaning robot
p47
aVfrom a company called Dyson, in the U.K. Except it was so expensive \u2014
p48
aV3,500 dollars \u2014 they didn't release it.
p49
aa(lp50
VBut at the bottom left, you see Electrolux, which is on sale.
p51
aVAnother one from Karcher.
p52
aVAt the bottom right is one that I built in my lab
p53
aVabout 10 years ago, and we finally turned that into a product.
p54
aVAnd let me just show you that.
p55
aVWe're going to give this away I think, Chris said, after the talk.
p56
aVThis is a robot that you can go out and buy, and that will clean up your floor.
p57
aVAnd it starts off sort of just going around in ever-increasing circles.
p58
aVIf it hits something \u2014 you people see that?
p59
aVNow it's doing wall-following, it's following around my feet
p60
aVto clean up around me. Let's see, let's \u2014
p61
aVoh, who stole my Rice Krispies? They stole my Rice Krispies!
p62
aV(Laughter)
p63
aVDon't worry, relax, no, relax, it's a robot, it's smart!
p64
aV(Laughter)
p65
aVSee, the three-year-old kids, they don't worry about it.
p66
aVIt's grown-ups that get really upset.
p67
aV(Laughter)
p68
aVWe'll just put some crap here.
p69
aV(Laughter)
p70
aVOkay.
p71
aV(Laughter)
p72
aVI don't know if you see \u2014 so, I put a bunch of Rice Krispies there,
p73
aVI put some pennies, let's just shoot it at that, see if it cleans up.
p74
aVYeah, OK. So \u2014
p75
aVwe'll leave that for later.
p76
aV(Applause)
p77
aa(lp78
VPart of the trick was building a better cleaning mechanism, actually;
p79
aVthe intelligence on board was fairly simple.
p80
aVAnd that's true with a lot of robots.
p81
aVWe've all, I think, become, sort of computational chauvinists,
p82
aVand think that computation is everything,
p83
aVbut the mechanics still matter.
p84
aVHere's another robot, the PackBot,
p85
aVthat we've been building for a bunch of years.
p86
aVIt's a military surveillance robot, to go in ahead of troops \u2014
p87
aVlooking at caves, for instance.
p88
aVBut we had to make it fairly robust,
p89
aVmuch more robust than the robots we build in our labs.
p90
aV(Laughter)
p91
aVOn board that robot is a PC running Linux.
p92
aVIt can withstand a 400G shock. The robot has local intelligence:
p93
aVit can flip itself over, can get itself into communication range,
p94
aVcan go upstairs by itself, et cetera.
p95
aVOkay, so it's doing local navigation there.
p96
aVA soldier gives it a command to go upstairs, and it does.
p97
aVThat was not a controlled descent.
p98
aV(Laughter)
p99
aVNow it's going to head off.
p100
aVAnd the big breakthrough for these robots, really, was September 11th.
p101
aVWe had the robots down at the World Trade Center late that evening.
p102
aVCouldn't do a lot in the main rubble pile,
p103
aVthings were just too \u2014 there was nothing left to do.
p104
aVBut we did go into all the surrounding buildings that had been evacuated,
p105
aVand searched for possible survivors in the buildings
p106
aVthat were too dangerous to go into.
p107
aVLet's run this video.
p108
aVReporter: ...battlefield companions are helping to reduce the combat risks.
p109
aVNick Robertson has that story.
p110
aVRodney Brooks: Can we have another one of these?
p111
aVOkay, good.
p112
aVSo, this is a corporal who had seen a robot two weeks previously.
p113
aVHe's sending robots into caves, looking at what's going on.
p114
aVThe robot's being totally autonomous.
p115
aVThe worst thing that's happened in the cave so far
p116
aVwas one of the robots fell down ten meters.
p117
aa(lp118
VSo one year ago, the US military didn't have these robots.
p119
aVNow they're on active duty in Afghanistan every day.
p120
aVAnd that's one of the reasons they say a robot invasion is happening.
p121
aVThere's a sea change happening in how \u2014 where technology's going.
p122
aVThanks.
p123
aVAnd over the next couple of months,
p124
aVwe're going to be sending robots in production
p125
aVdown producing oil wells to get that last few years of oil out of the ground.
p126
aVVery hostile environments, 150\u02da C, 10,000 PSI.
p127
aVAutonomous robots going down, doing this sort of work.
p128
aVBut robots like this, they're a little hard to program.
p129
aVHow, in the future, are we going to program our robots
p130
aVand make them easier to use?
p131
aVAnd I want to actually use a robot here \u2014
p132
aVa robot named Chris \u2014 stand up. Yeah. Okay.
p133
aVCome over here. Now notice, he thinks robots have to be a bit stiff.
p134
aVHe sort of does that. But I'm going to \u2014
p135
aVChris Anderson: I'm just British. RB: Oh.
p136
aV(Laughter)
p137
aV(Applause)
p138
aVI'm going to show this robot a task. It's a very complex task.
p139
aVNow notice, he nodded there, he was giving me some indication
p140
aVhe was understanding the flow of communication.
p141
aVAnd if I'd said something completely bizarre
p142
aVhe would have looked askance at me, and regulated the conversation.
p143
aVSo now I brought this up in front of him.
p144
aVI'd looked at his eyes, and I saw his eyes looked at this bottle top.
p145
aVAnd I'm doing this task here, and he's checking up.
p146
aVHis eyes are going back and forth up to me, to see what I'm looking at \u2014
p147
aVso we've got shared attention.
p148
aVAnd so I do this task, and he looks, and he looks to me
p149
aVto see what's happening next. And now I'll give him the bottle,
p150
aVand we'll see if he can do the task. Can you do that?
p151
aV(Laughter)
p152
aVOkay. He's pretty good. Yeah. Good, good, good.
p153
aVI didn't show you how to do that.
p154
aVNow see if you can put it back together.
p155
aV(Laughter)
p156
aVAnd he thinks a robot has to be really slow.
p157
aVGood robot, that's good.
p158
aa(lp159
VSo we saw a bunch of things there.
p160
aVWe saw when we're interacting,
p161
aVwe're trying to show someone how to do something, we direct their visual attention.
p162
aVThe other thing communicates their internal state to us,
p163
aVwhether he's understanding or not, regulates a social interaction.
p164
aVThere was shared attention looking at the same sort of thing,
p165
aVand recognizing socially communicated reinforcement at the end.
p166
aVAnd we've been trying to put that into our lab robots
p167
aVbecause we think this is how you're going to want to interact with robots in the future.
p168
aVI just want to show you one technical diagram here.
p169
aVThe most important thing for building a robot that you can interact with socially
p170
aVis its visual attention system.
p171
aVBecause what it pays attention to is what it's seeing
p172
aVand interacting with, and what you're understanding what it's doing.
p173
aVSo in the videos I'm about to show you,
p174
aVyou're going to see a visual attention system on a robot
p175
aVwhich has \u2014 it looks for skin tone in HSV space,
p176
aVso it works across all human colorings.
p177
aVIt looks for highly saturated colors, from toys.
p178
aVAnd it looks for things that move around.
p179
aVAnd it weights those together into an attention window,
p180
aVand it looks for the highest-scoring place \u2014
p181
aVthe stuff where the most interesting stuff is happening \u2014
p182
aVand that is what its eyes then segue to.
p183
aVAnd it looks right at that.
p184
aVAt the same time, some top-down sort of stuff:
p185
aVmight decide that it's lonely and look for skin tone,
p186
aVor might decide that it's bored and look for a toy to play with.
p187
aVAnd so these weights change.
p188
aa(lp189
VAnd over here on the right,
p190
aVthis is what we call the Steven Spielberg memorial module.
p191
aVDid people see the movie "AI"? (Audience: Yes.)
p192
aa(lp193
VRB: Yeah, it was really bad, but \u2014
p194
aa(lp195
Vremember, especially when Haley Joel Osment, the little robot,
p196
aVlooked at the blue fairy for 2,000 years without taking his eyes off it?
p197
aVWell, this gets rid of that,
p198
aVbecause this is a habituation Gaussian that gets negative,
p199
aVand more and more intense as it looks at one thing.
p200
aVAnd it gets bored, so it will then look away at something else.
p201
aVSo, once you've got that \u2014 and here's a robot, here's Kismet,
p202
aVlooking around for a toy. You can tell what it's looking at.
p203
aVYou can estimate its gaze direction from those eyeballs covering its camera,
p204
aVand you can tell when it's actually seeing the toy.
p205
aVAnd it's got a little bit of an emotional response here.
p206
aV(Laughter)
p207
aVBut it's still going to pay attention
p208
aVif something more significant comes into its field of view \u2014
p209
aVsuch as Cynthia Breazeal, the builder of this robot, from the right.
p210
aVIt sees her, pays attention to her.
p211
aVKismet has an underlying, three-dimensional emotional space,
p212
aVa vector space, of where it is emotionally.
p213
aVAnd at different places in that space, it expresses \u2014
p214
aVcan we have the volume on here?
p215
aVCan you hear that now, out there? (Audience: Yeah.)
p216
aa(lp217
VKismet: Do you really think so? Do you really think so?
p218
aVDo you really think so?
p219
aa(lp220
VRB: So it's expressing its emotion through its face
p221
aVand the prosody in its voice.
p222
aVAnd when I was dealing with my robot over here,
p223
aVChris, the robot, was measuring the prosody in my voice,
p224
aVand so we have the robot measure prosody for four basic messages
p225
aVthat mothers give their children pre-linguistically.
p226
aVHere we've got naive subjects praising the robot:
p227
aa(lp228
VVoice: Nice robot.
p229
aVYou're such a cute little robot.
p230
aV(Laughter)
p231
aVRB: And the robot's reacting appropriately.
p232
aa(lp233
VVoice: ...very good, Kismet.
p234
aV(Laughter)
p235
aa(lp236
VVoice: Look at my smile.
p237
aa(lp238
VRB: It smiles. She imitates the smile. This happens a lot.
p239
aVThese are naive subjects.
p240
aVHere we asked them to get the robot's attention
p241
aVand indicate when they have the robot's attention.
p242
aa(lp243
VVoice: Hey, Kismet, ah, there it is.
p244
aa(lp245
VRB: So she realizes she has the robot's attention.
p246
aVVoice: Kismet, do you like the toy? Oh.
p247
aa(lp248
VRB: Now, here they're asked to prohibit the robot,
p249
aVand this first woman really pushes the robot into an emotional corner.
p250
aa(lp251
VVoice: No. No. You're not to do that. No.
p252
aV(Laughter)
p253
aa(lp254
VNot appropriate. No. No.
p255
aV(Laughter)
p256
aa(lp257
VRB: I'm going to leave it at that.
p258
aa(lp259
VWe put that together. Then we put in turn taking.
p260
aVWhen we talk to someone, we talk.
p261
aVThen we sort of raise our eyebrows, move our eyes,
p262
aVgive the other person the idea it's their turn to talk.
p263
aVAnd then they talk, and then we pass the baton back and forth between each other.
p264
aVSo we put this in the robot.
p265
aVWe got a bunch of naive subjects in,
p266
aVwe didn't tell them anything about the robot,
p267
aVsat them down in front of the robot and said, talk to the robot.
p268
aVNow what they didn't know was,
p269
aVthe robot wasn't understanding a word they said,
p270
aVand that the robot wasn't speaking English.
p271
aVIt was just saying random English phonemes.
p272
aVAnd I want you to watch carefully, at the beginning of this,
p273
aVwhere this person, Ritchie, who happened to talk to the robot for 25 minutes \u2014
p274
aV(Laughter)
p275
aV\u2014 says, "I want to show you something.
p276
aVI want to show you my watch."
p277
aVAnd he brings the watch center, into the robot's field of vision,
p278
aVpoints to it, gives it a motion cue,
p279
aVand the robot looks at the watch quite successfully.
p280
aVWe don't know whether he understood or not that the robot \u2014
p281
aVNotice the turn-taking.
p282
aVRitchie: OK, I want to show you something. OK, this is a watch
p283
aVthat my girlfriend gave me.
p284
aVRobot: Oh, cool.
p285
aVRitchie: Yeah, look, it's got a little blue light in it too. I almost lost it this week.
p286
aV(Laughter)
p287
aVRB: So it's making eye contact with him, following his eyes.
p288
aVRitchie: Can you do the same thing? Robot: Yeah, sure.
p289
aVRB: And they successfully have that sort of communication.
p290
aa(lp291
VAnd here's another aspect of the sorts of things that Chris and I were doing.
p292
aVThis is another robot, Cog.
p293
aVThey first make eye contact, and then, when Christie looks over at this toy,
p294
aVthe robot estimates her gaze direction
p295
aVand looks at the same thing that she's looking at.
p296
aV(Laughter)
p297
aVSo we're going to see more and more of this sort of robot
p298
aVover the next few years in labs.
p299
aVBut then the big questions, two big questions that people ask me are:
p300
aVif we make these robots more and more human-like,
p301
aVwill we accept them, will we \u2014 will they need rights eventually?
p302
aVAnd the other question people ask me is, will they want to take over?
p303
aV(Laughter)
p304
aVAnd on the first \u2014 you know, this has been a very Hollywood theme
p305
aVwith lots of movies. You probably recognize these characters here \u2014
p306
aVwhere in each of these cases, the robots want more respect.
p307
aVWell, do you ever need to give robots respect?
p308
aVThey're just machines, after all.
p309
aVBut I think, you know, we have to accept that we are just machines.
p310
aVAfter all, that's certainly what modern molecular biology says about us.
p311
aVYou don't see a description of how, you know,
p312
aVMolecule A, you know, comes up and docks with this other molecule.
p313
aVAnd it's moving forward, you know, propelled by various charges,
p314
aVand then the soul steps in and tweaks those molecules so that they connect.
p315
aVIt's all mechanistic. We are mechanism.
p316
aVIf we are machines, then in principle at least,
p317
aVwe should be able to build machines out of other stuff,
p318
aVwhich are just as alive as we are.
p319
aVBut I think for us to admit that,
p320
aVwe have to give up on our special-ness, in a certain way.
p321
aVAnd we've had the retreat from special-ness
p322
aVunder the barrage of science and technology many times
p323
aVover the last few hundred years, at least.
p324
aV500 years ago we had to give up the idea
p325
aVthat we are the center of the universe
p326
aVwhen the earth started to go around the sun;
p327
aV150 years ago, with Darwin, we had to give up the idea we were different from animals.
p328
aVAnd to imagine \u2014 you know, it's always hard for us.
p329
aVRecently we've been battered with the idea that maybe
p330
aVwe didn't even have our own creation event, here on earth,
p331
aVwhich people didn't like much. And then the human genome said,
p332
aVmaybe we only have 35,000 genes. And that was really \u2014
p333
aVpeople didn't like that, we've got more genes than that.
p334
aVWe don't like to give up our special-ness, so, you know,
p335
aVhaving the idea that robots could really have emotions,
p336
aVor that robots could be living creatures \u2014
p337
aVI think is going to be hard for us to accept.
p338
aVBut we're going to come to accept it over the next 50 years or so.
p339
aa(lp340
VAnd the second question is, will the machines want to take over?
p341
aVAnd here the standard scenario is that we create these things,
p342
aVthey grow, we nurture them, they learn a lot from us,
p343
aVand then they start to decide that we're pretty boring, slow.
p344
aVThey want to take over from us.
p345
aVAnd for those of you that have teenagers, you know what that's like.
p346
aV(Laughter)
p347
aVBut Hollywood extends it to the robots.
p348
aVAnd the question is, you know,
p349
aVwill someone accidentally build a robot that takes over from us?
p350
aVAnd that's sort of like this lone guy in the backyard,
p351
aVyou know \u2014 "I accidentally built a 747."
p352
aVI don't think that's going to happen.
p353
aVAnd I don't think \u2014
p354
aV(Laughter)
p355
aV\u2014 I don't think we're going to deliberately build robots
p356
aVthat we're uncomfortable with.
p357
aVWe'll \u2014 you know, they're not going to have a super bad robot.
p358
aVBefore that has to come to be a mildly bad robot,
p359
aVand before that a not so bad robot.
p360
aV(Laughter)
p361
aVAnd we're just not going to let it go that way.
p362
aV(Laughter)
p363
aVSo, I think I'm going to leave it at that: the robots are coming,
p364
aVwe don't have too much to worry about, it's going to be a lot of fun,
p365
aVand I hope you all enjoy the journey over the next 50 years.
