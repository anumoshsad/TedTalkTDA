VMost people don't know that when I went to high school in this country \u2014
p4
aVI applied for university at a time when I was convinced
p5
aVI was going to be an artist and be a sculptor.
p6
aVAnd I came from a very privileged background. I was very lucky.
p7
aVMy family was wealthy, and my father believed in one thing,
p8
aVand that was to give us all as much education as we wanted.
p9
aVAnd I announced I wanted to be a sculptor in Paris.
p10
aVAnd he was a clever man. He sort of said,
p11
aV"Well, that's OK, but you've done very well in your math SATs."
p12
aVIn fact, I'd got an 800. And he thought I did very well \u2014 and I did, too \u2014 in the arts:
p13
aVthis was my passion.
p14
aVAnd he said "If you go to MIT," to which I had been given early admission,
p15
aV"I will pay for every year you're at MIT,
p16
aVin graduate or undergraduate \u2014 as much as you want \u2014
p17
aVI will pay for an equal number of years for you to live in Paris."
p18
aVAnd I thought that was the best deal in town, so I accepted it immediately.
p19
aVAnd I decided that if I was good in art, and I was good in mathematics,
p20
aVI'd study architecture, which was the blending of the two.
p21
aa(lp22
VI went and told my headmaster that, at prep school.
p23
aVAnd I said to him what I was doing, that I was going to go study architecture
p24
aVbecause it was art and mathematics put together.
p25
aVHe said to me something that just went completely over my head.
p26
aVHe said, "You know, I like grey suits, and I like pin-striped suits,
p27
aVbut I don't like grey pin-striped suits."
p28
aVAnd I thought, "What a turkey this guy is," and I went off to MIT.
p29
aVI studied architecture, then did a second degree in architecture,
p30
aVand then actually quickly realized that it wasn't architecture.
p31
aVThat really, the mixing of art and science was computers,
p32
aVand that that really was the place to bring both, and enjoyed a career doing that.
p33
aa(lp34
VAnd probably, if I were to fill out Jim Citrin's scale,
p35
aVI'd put 100 percent on the side of the equation
p36
aVwhere you spend time making it possible for others to be creative.
p37
aVAnd after doing this for a long time, and the Media Lab passing the baton on,
p38
aVI thought, "Well, maybe it's time for me to do a project.
p39
aVSomething that would be important, but also something
p40
aVthat would take advantage of all of these privileges that one had."
p41
aVAnd in the case of the Media Lab, knowing a lot of people,
p42
aVknowing people who were either executives or wealthy,
p43
aVand also not having, in my own case, a career to worry about anymore.
p44
aVMy career, I mean, I'd done my career.
p45
aVDidn't have to worry about earning money.
p46
aVDidn't have to worry about what people thought about me.
p47
aVAnd I said, "Boy, let's really do something that takes advantage of all these features,"
p48
aVand thought that if we could address education, by leveraging the children,
p49
aVand bringing to the world the access of the computers,
p50
aVthat that was really the thing we should do.
p51
aVNever shown this picture before, and probably going to be sued for it.
p52
aVIt's taken at three o'clock in the morning, without the permission of the company.
p53
aVIt's about two weeks old. There they are, folks.
p54
aa(lp55
V(Applause)
p56
aa(lp57
VIf you look at the picture, you'll see they're stacked up.
p58
aVThose are conveyor belts that go around.
p59
aVThis is one of the conveyor belts with the thing going by,
p60
aVbut then you'll see the ones up above.
p61
aVWhat happens is, they burn into flash memory the software,
p62
aVand then test them for a few hours.
p63
aVBut you've got to have the thing moving on the assembly line, because it's constant.
p64
aVSo they go around in this loop, which is why you see them up there.
p65
aVSo this was great for us because it was a real turning point. But it goes back.
p66
aVThis picture was taken in 1982, just before the IBM PC was even announced.
p67
aVSeymour Papert and I were bringing computers to schools
p68
aVand developing nations at a time when it was way ahead of itself.
p69
aVBut one thing we learned was that these kids can absolutely jump into it
p70
aVjust the same way as our kids do here.
p71
aa(lp72
VAnd when people tell me, "Who's going to teach the teachers to teach the kids?"
p73
aVI say to myself, "What planet do you come from?"
p74
aVOkay, there's not a person in this room \u2014 I don't care how techie you are \u2014
p75
aVthere's not a person in this room that doesn't give their laptop or cell phone to a kid
p76
aVto help them debug it. OK?
p77
aVWe all need help, even those of us who are very seasoned.
p78
aVThis picture of Seymour \u2014 25 years ago. Seymour made a very simple
p79
aVobservation in 1968, and then basically presented it in 1970 \u2014
p80
aVApril 11 to be precise \u2014 called "Teaching Children Thinking."
p81
aVWhat he observed was that kids who write computer programs
p82
aVunderstand things differently, and when they debug the programs,
p83
aVthey come the closest to learning about learning.
p84
aVThat was very important, and in some sense, we've lost that.
p85
aVKids don't program enough and boy,
p86
aVif there's anything I hope this brings back, it's programming to kids.
p87
aa(lp88
VIt's really important. Using applications is OK,
p89
aVbut programming is absolutely fundamental.
p90
aVThis is being launched with three languages in it: Squeak, Logo, and
p91
aVa third, that I've never even seen before.
p92
aVThe point being, this is going to be very, very intensive on the programming side.
p93
aVThis photograph is very important because it's much later.
p94
aVThis is in the early 2000s. My son, Dimitri \u2014 who's here,
p95
aVmany of you know Dimitri \u2014 went to Cambodia, set up this school
p96
aVthat we had built, just as the school connected it to the Internet.
p97
aVAnd these kids had their laptops. But it was really what spirited this,
p98
aVplus the influence of Joe and others. We started One Laptop per Child.
p99
aVThis is the same village in Cambodia, just a couple of months ago.
p100
aVThese kids are real pros. There were just 7,000 machines out there
p101
aVbeing tested by kids. Being a nonprofit is absolutely fundamental.
p102
aa(lp103
VEverybody advised me not to be a nonprofit, but they were all wrong.
p104
aVAnd the reason being a nonprofit is important is actually twofold.
p105
aVThere are many reasons, but the two that merit the little bit of time is:
p106
aVone, the clarity of purpose is there. The moral purpose is clear.
p107
aVI can see any head of state, any executive I want, at any time, because
p108
aVI'm not selling laptops. OK? I have no shareholders.
p109
aVWhether we sell, it doesn't make any difference whatsoever.
p110
aVThe clarity of purpose is absolutely critical. And the second is very counterintuitive \u2014
p111
aVyou can get the best people in the world.
p112
aVIf you look at our professional services, including search firms,
p113
aVincluding communications, including legal services, including banking,
p114
aVthey're all pro bono. And it's not to save money.
p115
aVWe've got money in the bank. It's because you get the best people.
p116
aVYou get the people who are doing it because they believe in the mission,
p117
aVand they're the best people.
p118
aa(lp119
VWe couldn't afford to hire a CFO. We put out a job description for a CFO at zero salary,
p120
aVand we had a queue of people.
p121
aVIt allows you to team up with people. The U.N.'s not going to be
p122
aVour partner if we're profit making. So announcing this with Kofi Annan
p123
aVwas very important, and the U.N. allowed us
p124
aVto basically reach all the countries. And this was the machine we were showing
p125
aVbefore I met Yves Behar.
p126
aVAnd while this machine in some sense is silly,
p127
aVin retrospect, it actually served a very important purpose.
p128
aVThat pencil-yellow crank was remembered by everybody.
p129
aVEverybody remembered the pencil-yellow crank. It's different.
p130
aVIt was getting its power in a different way. It's kind of childlike.
p131
aVEven though this wasn't the direction we went because the crank \u2014
p132
aVit really is stupid to have it on board, by the way.
p133
aVIn spite of what some people in the press don't get it, didn't understand it,
p134
aVwe didn't take it off because we didn't want to do \u2014
p135
aVhaving it on the laptop itself is really not what you want.
p136
aVYou want a separate thing, like the AC adaptor.
p137
aVI didn't bring one with me, but they really work much better off-board.
p138
aVAnd then, I could tell you lots about the laptop, but I decided on just four things.
p139
aa(lp140
VJust keep in mind \u2014 because there are other people, including Bill Gates,
p141
aVwho said, "Gee, you've got a real computer."
p142
aVThat computer is unlike anything you've had, and does things \u2014
p143
aVthere are four of them \u2014
p144
aVthat you don't come close to. And it's very important to be low power,
p145
aVand I hope that's picked up more by the industry.
p146
aVThat the reason that you want to be below two watts is
p147
aVthat's roughly what you can generate with your upper body.
p148
aVDual-mode display \u2014 that sunlight display's fantastic.
p149
aVWe were using it at lunch today in the sunlight, and the more sunlight the better.
p150
aVAnd that was really critical. The mesh network, it'll become commonplace.
p151
aVAnd of course, "rugged" goes without saying.
p152
aVAnd the reason I think design matters isn't because I wanted to go to art school.
p153
aa(lp154
VAnd by the way, when I graduated from MIT,
p155
aVI thought the worst and silliest thing to do would be to go to Paris for six years. (Laughter)
p156
aVSo, I didn't do that. But design matters for a number of reasons.
p157
aVThe most important being that it is the best way to make an inexpensive product.
p158
aVMost people make inexpensive products by taking cheap design,
p159
aVcheap labor, cheap components, and making a cheap laptop.
p160
aVAnd, in English, the word "cheap" has
p161
aVa double meaning, which is really appropriate,
p162
aVbecause it's cheap, in the pejorative sense, as well as inexpensive.
p163
aVBut if you take a different approach, and you think of very large-scale integration,
p164
aVvery advanced materials, very advanced manufacturing \u2014
p165
aVso you're pouring chemicals in one end, iPods are spewing out the other \u2014
p166
aVand really cool design, that's what we wanted to do.
p167
aa(lp168
VAnd I can race through these and save a lot of time because
p169
aVYves and I obviously didn't compare notes.
p170
aVThese are his slides, and so I don't have to talk about them.
p171
aVBut it was really, to us, very important as a strategy.
p172
aVIt wasn't just to kind of make it cute, because somebody \u2014
p173
aVyou know, good design is very important.
p174
aVYves showed one of the power-generating devices.
p175
aVThe mesh network, the reason I \u2014 and I won't go into it in great detail \u2014
p176
aVbut when we deliver laptops to kids in the remotest and poorest parts of the world,
p177
aVthey're connected. There's not just laptops.
p178
aVAnd so, we have to drop in satellite dishes. We put in generators.
p179
aVIt's a lot of stuff that goes behind these. These can talk to each other.
p180
aVIf you're in a desert, they can talk to each other about two kilometers apart.
p181
aVIf you're in the jungle, it's about 500 meters. So if a kid bicycles home,
p182
aVor walks a few miles, they're going to be off the grid, so to speak.
p183
aVThey're not going to be near another laptop,
p184
aVso you have to nail these onto a tree, and sort of, get it.
p185
aa(lp186
VYou don't call Verizon or Sprint. You build your own network.
p187
aVAnd that's very important, the user interface.
p188
aVWe are launching with 18 keyboards. English is by far the minority.
p189
aVLatin is relatively rare, too. You just look at some of the languages.
p190
aVI'm willing to suspect some of you hadn't even heard of them before.
p191
aVIs there anybody in the room, one person, unless you work with OLPC,
p192
aVis there anybody in the room that can tell me what language
p193
aVthe keyboard is that's on the screen? There's only one hand \u2014 so you get it.
p194
aVYes, you're right. He's right. It's Amharic,
p195
aVit's Ethiopian. In Ethiopia, there's never been a keyboard.
p196
aVThere is no keyboard standard because there's no market.
p197
aVAnd this is the big difference.
p198
aa(lp199
VAgain, when you're a nonprofit, you look at children as a mission, not as a market.
p200
aVSo we went to Ethiopia, and we helped them make a keyboard.
p201
aVAnd this will become the standard Ethiopian keyboard.
p202
aVSo what I want to end with is sort of what we're doing to roll it out.
p203
aVAnd we changed strategy completely. I decided at the beginning \u2014
p204
aVit was a pretty good thing to decide in the beginning,
p205
aVit's not what we're doing now \u2014 is to go to six countries.
p206
aVBig countries, one of them is not so big, but it's rich.
p207
aVHere's the six. We went to the six,
p208
aVand in each case the head of state said he would do it, he'd do a million.
p209
aVIn the case of Gaddafi, he'd do 1.2 million, and that they would launch it.
p210
aVWe thought, this is exactly the right strategy, get it out,
p211
aVand then the little countries could sort of piggyback on these big countries.
p212
aa(lp213
VAnd so I went to each of those countries
p214
aVat least six times, met with the head of state probably two or three times.
p215
aVIn each case, got the ministers, went through a lot of the stuff.
p216
aVThis was a period in my life where I was traveling 330 days per year.
p217
aVNot something you'd envy or want to do.
p218
aVIn the case of Libya, it was a lot of fun meeting Gaddafi in his tent.
p219
aVThe camel smells were unbelievable.
p220
aVAnd it was 45 degrees C. I mean, this was not
p221
aVwhat you'd call a cool experience. And former countries \u2014
p222
aVI say former, because none of them really came through this summer \u2014
p223
aVthere was a big difference between getting a head of state
p224
aVto have a photo opportunity, make a press release.
p225
aVSo we went to smaller ones. Uruguay, bless their hearts.
p226
aVSmall country, not so rich. President said he'd do it, and guess what?
p227
aVHe did do it. The tender had nothing in it that related to us,
p228
aVnothing specific about sunlight-readable, mesh-network, low-power,
p229
aVbut just a vanilla laptop proposal.
p230
aVAnd guess what? We won it hands down.
p231
aVWhen it was announced that they were going to do every child in Uruguay,
p232
aVthe first 100,000, boom, went to OLPC.
p233
aVThe next day \u2014 the next day, not even 24 hours had passed \u2014 in Peru,
p234
aVthe president of Peru said, "We'll do 250." And boom, a little domino effect.
p235
aa(lp236
VThe president of Rwanda stepped in and said he would do it.
p237
aVThe president of Ethiopia said he would do it.
p238
aVAnd boom, boom, boom. The president of Mongolia.
p239
aVAnd so what happens is, these things start to happen with these countries \u2014
p240
aVstill not enough.
p241
aVAdd up all those countries, it didn't quite get to thing, so we said,
p242
aV"Let's start a program in the United States." So, end of August, early September,
p243
aVwe decide to do this. We announced it near the middle, end \u2014
p244
aVjust when the Clinton Initiative was taking place.
p245
aVWe thought that was a good time to announce it.
p246
aVLaunched it on the 12 of November.
p247
aVWe said it would be just for a short period until the 26. We've extended it until the 31.
p248
aVAnd the "Give One, Get One" program is really important because
p249
aVit got a lot of people absolutely interested.
p250
aa(lp251
VThe first day it was just wild. And then we said,
p252
aV"Well, let's get people to give many. Not just one, and get one,
p253
aVbut maybe give 100, give 1,000." And that's where you come in.
p254
aVAnd that's where I think it's very important. I don't want you all to go out and
p255
aVbuy 400 dollars worth of laptops. Okay? Do it, but that's not going to help. Okay?
p256
aVIf everybody in this room goes out tonight and orders one of these things for 400 dollars,
p257
aVwhatever it is, 300 people in the room doing it \u2014 yeah, great.
p258
aVI want you do something else.
p259
aVAnd it's not to go out and buy 100 or 1,000, though,
p260
aVI invite you to do that, and 10,000 would be even better.
p261
aa(lp262
VTell people about it! It's got to become viral, OK?
p263
aVUse your mailing lists. People in this room have extraordinary mailing lists.
p264
aVGet your friends to give one, get one.
p265
aVAnd if each one of you sends it to 300 or 400 people, that would be fantastic.
p266
aVI won't dwell on the pricing at all.
p267
aVJust to say that when you do the "Give One, Get One,"
p268
aVa lot of press is a bit about, "They didn't make it, it's 188 dollars, it's not 100."
p269
aVIt will be 100 in two years. It will go below 100.
p270
aVWe've pledged not to add features, but to bring that price down.
p271
aVBut it was the countries that wanted it to go up, and
p272
aVwe let them push it up for all sorts of reasons. So what you can do \u2014
p273
aVI've just said it. Don't just give one, get one.
p274
aa(lp275
VI just want to end with one last one. This one is not even
p276
aV24-hours old, or maybe it's 24-hours.
p277
aVThe first kids got their laptops. They got them by ship,
p278
aVand I'm talking now about 7,000, 8,000 at a time went out this week.
p279
aVThey went to Uruguay, Peru, Mexico.
p280
aVAnd it's been slow coming, and we're only making about 5,000 a week,
p281
aVbut we hope, we hope, sometime in next year,
p282
aVmaybe by the middle of the year,
p283
aVto hit a million a month. Now put that number,
p284
aVand a million isn't so much. It's not a big number.
p285
aVWe're selling a billion cell phones worldwide this year.
p286
aVBut a million a month in laptop-land is a big number.
p287
aVAnd the world production today, everybody combined, making laptops,
p288
aVis five million a month. So I'm standing here telling you that sometime next year,
p289
aVwe're going to make 20 percent of the world production.
p290
aVAnd if we do that, there are going to be a lot of lucky kids out there.
p291
aVAnd we hope if you have EG two years from now,
p292
aVor whenever you have it again,
p293
aVI won't have bad breath, and I will be invited back,
p294
aVand will have, hopefully by then, maybe 100 million out there to children.
p295
aVThank you.
