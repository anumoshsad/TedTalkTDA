VOne out of two of you women
p4
aVwill be impacted by cardiovascular disease
p5
aVin your lifetime.
p6
aVSo this is the leading killer of women.
p7
aVIt's a closely held secret
p8
aVfor reasons I don't know.
p9
aVIn addition to making this personal \u2014
p10
aVso we're going to talk about your relationship with your heart
p11
aVand all women's relationship with their heart \u2014
p12
aVwe're going to wax into the politics.
p13
aVBecause the personal, as you know, is political.
p14
aVAnd not enough is being done about this.
p15
aVAnd as we have watched women
p16
aVconquer breast cancer
p17
aVthrough the breast cancer campaign,
p18
aVthis is what we need to do now with heart.
p19
aa(lp20
VSince 1984,
p21
aVmore women die in the U.S. than men.
p22
aVSo where we used to think of heart disease
p23
aVas being a man's problem primarily \u2014
p24
aVwhich that was never true,
p25
aVbut that was kind of how everybody thought in the 1950s and '60s,
p26
aVand it was in all the textbooks.
p27
aVIt's certainly what I learned when I was training.
p28
aVIf we were to remain sexist, and that was not right,
p29
aVbut if we were going to go forward and be sexist,
p30
aVit's actually a woman's disease.
p31
aVSo it's a woman's disease now.
p32
aa(lp33
VAnd one of the things that you see
p34
aVis that male line,
p35
aVthe mortality is going down, down, down, down, down.
p36
aVAnd you see the female line since 1984,
p37
aVthe gap is widening.
p38
aVMore and more women, two, three, four times more women,
p39
aVdying of heart disease than men.
p40
aVAnd that's too short of a time period
p41
aVfor all the different risk factors that we know
p42
aVto change.
p43
aVSo what this really suggested to us
p44
aVat the national level
p45
aVwas that diagnostic and therapeutic strategies,
p46
aVwhich had been developed in men, by men, for men
p47
aVfor the last 50 years \u2014
p48
aVand they work pretty well in men, don't they? \u2014
p49
aVweren't working so well for women.
p50
aVSo that was a big wake-up call
p51
aVin the 1980's.
p52
aa(lp53
VHeart disease kills more women
p54
aVat all ages
p55
aVthan breast cancer.
p56
aVAnd the breast cancer campaign \u2014
p57
aVagain, this is not a competition.
p58
aVWe're trying to be as good as the breast cancer campaign.
p59
aVWe need to be as good as the breast cancer campaign
p60
aVto address this crisis.
p61
aVNow sometimes when people see this,
p62
aVI hear this gasp.
p63
aVWe can all think of someone,
p64
aVoften a young woman,
p65
aVwho has been impacted by breast cancer.
p66
aVWe often can't think of a young woman
p67
aVwho has heart disease.
p68
aVI'm going to tell you why.
p69
aVHeart disease kills people,
p70
aVoften very quickly.
p71
aVSo the first time heart disease strikes in women and men,
p72
aVhalf of the time it's sudden cardiac death \u2014
p73
aVno opportunity to say good-bye,
p74
aVno opportunity to take her to the chemotherapy,
p75
aVno opportunity to help her pick out a wig.
p76
aa(lp77
VBreast cancer,
p78
aVmortality is down to four percent.
p79
aVAnd that is the 40 years
p80
aVthat women have advocated.
p81
aVBetty Ford, Nancy Reagan stood up
p82
aVand said, "I'm a breast cancer survivor,"
p83
aVand it was okay to talk about it.
p84
aVAnd then physicians have gone to bat.
p85
aVWe've done the research.
p86
aVWe have effective therapies now.
p87
aVWomen are living longer than ever.
p88
aVThat has to happen in heart disease, and it's time.
p89
aVIt's not happening, and it's time.
p90
aa(lp91
VWe owe an incredible debt of gratitude
p92
aVto these two women.
p93
aVAs Barbara depicted
p94
aVin one of her amazing movies, "Yentl,"
p95
aVshe portrayed a young woman
p96
aVwho wanted an education.
p97
aVAnd she wanted to study the Talmud.
p98
aVAnd so how did she get educated then?
p99
aVShe had to impersonate a man.
p100
aVShe had to look like a man.
p101
aVShe had to make other people believe that she looked like a man
p102
aVand she could have the same rights
p103
aVthat the men had.
p104
aVBernadine Healy, Dr. Healy,
p105
aVwas a cardiologist.
p106
aVAnd right around that time, in the 1980's,
p107
aVthat we saw women and heart disease deaths
p108
aVgoing up, up, up, up, up,
p109
aVshe wrote an editorial
p110
aVin the New England Journal of Medicine
p111
aVand said, the Yentl syndrome.
p112
aVWomen are dying of heart disease,
p113
aVtwo, three, four times more than men.
p114
aVMortality is not going down, it's going up.
p115
aVAnd she questioned,
p116
aVshe hypothesized,
p117
aVis this a Yentl syndrome?
p118
aa(lp119
VAnd here's what the story is.
p120
aVIs it because women don't look like men,
p121
aVthey don't look like that male-pattern heart disease
p122
aVthat we've spent the last 50 years understanding
p123
aVand getting really good diagnostics
p124
aVand really good therapeutics,
p125
aVand therefore, they're not recognized for their heart disease.
p126
aVAnd they're just passed.
p127
aVThey don't get treated, they don't get detected,
p128
aVthey don't get the benefit of all the modern medicines.
p129
aa(lp130
VDoctor Healy then subsequently became
p131
aVthe first female director
p132
aVof our National Institutes of Health.
p133
aVAnd this is the biggest biomedical enterprise research
p134
aVin the world.
p135
aVAnd it funds a lot of my research.
p136
aVIt funds research all over the place.
p137
aVIt was a very big deal
p138
aVfor her to become director.
p139
aVAnd she started,
p140
aVin the face of a lot of controversy,
p141
aVthe Women's Health Initiative.
p142
aVAnd every woman in the room here
p143
aVhas benefited from that Women's Health Initiative.
p144
aVIt told us about hormone replacement therapy.
p145
aVIt's informed us about osteoporosis.
p146
aVIt informed us about breast cancer, colon cancer in women.
p147
aVSo a tremendous fund of knowledge
p148
aVdespite, again,
p149
aVthat so many people told her not to do it,
p150
aVit was too expensive.
p151
aVAnd the under-reading was women aren't worth it.
p152
aVShe was like, "Nope. Sorry. Women are worth it."
p153
aa(lp154
VWell there was a little piece of that Women's Health Initiative
p155
aVthat went to National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute,
p156
aVwhich is the cardiology part of the NIH.
p157
aVAnd we got to do the WISE study \u2014
p158
aVand the WISE stands for Women's Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation \u2014
p159
aVand I have chaired this study for the last 15 years.
p160
aVIt was a study to specifically ask,
p161
aVwhat's going on with women?
p162
aVWhy are more and more women dying
p163
aVof ischemic heart disease?
p164
aVSo in the WISE, 15 years ago,
p165
aVwe started out and said, "Well wow, there's a couple of key observations
p166
aVand we should probably follow up on that."
p167
aVAnd our colleagues in Washington, D.C.
p168
aVhad recently published
p169
aVthat when women have heart attacks and die,
p170
aVcompared to men who have heart attacks and die \u2014
p171
aVand again, this is millions of people,
p172
aVhappening every day \u2014
p173
aVwomen, in their fatty plaque \u2014
p174
aVand this is their coronary artery,
p175
aVso the main blood supply going into the heart muscle \u2014
p176
aVwomen erode,
p177
aVmen explode.
p178
aVYou're going to find some interesting analogies
p179
aVin this physiology.
p180
aa(lp181
V(Laughter)
p182
aa(lp183
VSo I'll describe the male-pattern heart attack first.
p184
aVHollywood heart attack. Ughhhh.
p185
aVHorrible chest pain.
p186
aVEKG goes pbbrrhh,
p187
aVso the doctors can see this hugely abnormal EKG.
p188
aVThere's a big clot in the middle of the artery.
p189
aVAnd they go up to the cath lab
p190
aVand boom, boom, boom get rid of the clot.
p191
aVThat's a man heart attack.
p192
aVSome women have those heart attacks,
p193
aVbut a whole bunch of women have this kind of heart attack,
p194
aVwhere it erodes,
p195
aVdoesn't completely fill with clot, symptoms are subtle,
p196
aVEKG findings are different \u2014
p197
aVfemale-pattern.
p198
aVSo what do you think happens to these gals?
p199
aVThey're often not recognized, sent home.
p200
aVI'm not sure what it was. Might have been gas.
p201
aa(lp202
VSo we picked up on that
p203
aVand we said, "You know, we now have the ability
p204
aVto look inside human beings
p205
aVwith these special catheters called IVUS:
p206
aVintravascular ultrasound."
p207
aVAnd we said, "We're going to hypothesize
p208
aVthat the fatty plaque in women
p209
aVis actually probably different,
p210
aVand deposited differently, than men."
p211
aVAnd because of the common knowledge
p212
aVof how women and men get fat.
p213
aVWhen we watch people become obese,
p214
aVwhere do men get fat?
p215
aVRight here, it's just a focal \u2014 right there.
p216
aVWhere do women get fat?
p217
aVAll over.
p218
aVCellulite here, cellulite here.
p219
aVSo we said, "Look, women look like they're pretty good
p220
aVabout putting kind of the garbage away,
p221
aVsmoothly putting it away.
p222
aVMen just have to dump it in a single area."
p223
aVSo we said, "Let's look at these."
p224
aa(lp225
VAnd so the yellow is the fatty plaque,
p226
aVand panel A is a man.
p227
aVAnd you can see, it's lumpy bumpy.
p228
aVHe's got a beer belly in his coronary arteries.
p229
aVPanel B is the woman, very smooth.
p230
aVShe's just laid it down nice and tidy.
p231
aV(Laughter)
p232
aVAnd if you did that angiogram,
p233
aVwhich is the red,
p234
aVyou can see the man's disease.
p235
aVSo 50 years
p236
aVof honing and crafting these angiograms,
p237
aVwe easily recognize
p238
aVmale-pattern disease.
p239
aVKind of hard to see that female-pattern disease.
p240
aVSo that was a discovery.
p241
aVNow what are the implications of that?
p242
aVWell once again, women get the angiogram
p243
aVand nobody can tell that they have a problem.
p244
aa(lp245
VSo we are working now on a non-invasive \u2014
p246
aVagain, these are all invasive studies.
p247
aVIdeally you would love to do all this non-invasively.
p248
aVAnd again, 50 years
p249
aVof good non-invasive stress testing,
p250
aVwe're pretty good at recognizing male-pattern disease
p251
aVwith stress tests.
p252
aVSo this is cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.
p253
aVWe're doing this at the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute
p254
aVin the Women's Heart Center.
p255
aVWe selected this for the research.
p256
aVThis is not in your community hospital,
p257
aVbut we would hope to translate this.
p258
aVAnd we're about two and a half years
p259
aVinto a five-year study.
p260
aa(lp261
VThis was the only modality
p262
aVthat can see the inner lining of the heart.
p263
aVAnd if you look carefully, you can see
p264
aVthat there's a black blush right there.
p265
aVAnd that is microvascular obstruction.
p266
aVThe syndrome, the female-pattern
p267
aVnow is called microvascular coronary dysfunction, or obstruction.
p268
aVThe second reason we really liked MRI
p269
aVis that there's no radiation.
p270
aVSo unlike the CAT scans, X-rays, thalliums,
p271
aVfor women
p272
aVwhose breast is in the way
p273
aVof looking at the heart,
p274
aVevery time we order something that has even a small amount of radiation,
p275
aVwe say, "Do we really need that test?"
p276
aVSo we're very excited about M.R.
p277
aVYou can't go and order it yet,
p278
aVbut this is an area of active inquiry
p279
aVwhere actually studying women
p280
aVis going to advance the field for women and men.
p281
aa(lp282
VWhat are the downstream consequences
p283
aVthen, when female-pattern heart disease
p284
aVis not recognized?
p285
aVThis is a figure
p286
aVfrom an editorial that I published
p287
aVin the European Heart Journal this last summer.
p288
aVAnd it was just a pictogram
p289
aVto sort of show
p290
aVwhy more women are dying of heart disease,
p291
aVdespite these good treatments
p292
aVthat we know and we have work.
p293
aVAnd when the woman
p294
aVhas male-pattern disease \u2014
p295
aVso she looks like Barbara in the movie \u2014
p296
aVthey get treated.
p297
aVAnd when you have female-pattern and you look like a woman,
p298
aVas Barbara does here with her husband,
p299
aVthey don't get the treatment.
p300
aVThese are our life-saving treatments.
p301
aVAnd those little red boxes are deaths.
p302
aVSo those are the consequences.
p303
aVAnd that is female-pattern
p304
aVand why we think the Yentl syndrome
p305
aVactually is explaining
p306
aVa lot of these gaps.
p307
aa(lp308
VThere's been wonderful news also
p309
aVabout studying women,
p310
aVfinally, in heart disease.
p311
aVAnd one of the the cutting-edge areas
p312
aVthat we're just incredibly excited about
p313
aVis stem cell therapy.
p314
aVIf you ask, what is the big difference
p315
aVbetween women and men physiologically?
p316
aVWhy are there women and men?
p317
aVBecause women bring new life into the world.
p318
aVThat's all stem cells.
p319
aVSo we hypothesized
p320
aVthat female stem cells might be better
p321
aVat identifying the injury,
p322
aVdoing some cellular repair
p323
aVor even producing new organs,
p324
aVwhich is one of the things
p325
aVthat we're trying to do with stem cell therapy.
p326
aVThese are female and male stem cells.
p327
aVAnd if you had an injured organ,
p328
aVif you had a heart attack
p329
aVand we wanted to repair that injured area,
p330
aVdo you want those robust,
p331
aVplentiful stem cells on the top?
p332
aVOr do you want these guys,
p333
aVthat look like they're out to lunch?
p334
aa(lp335
V(Laughter)
p336
aa(lp337
VAnd some of our investigative teams
p338
aVhave demonstrated
p339
aVthat female stem cells \u2014
p340
aVand this is in animals
p341
aVand increasingly we're showing this in humans \u2014
p342
aVthat female stem cells,
p343
aVwhen put even into a male body,
p344
aVdo better than male stem cells
p345
aVgoing into a male body.
p346
aVOne of the things that we say
p347
aVabout all of this female physiology \u2014
p348
aVbecause again, as much as we're talking about women and heart disease,
p349
aVwomen do, on average,
p350
aVhave better longevity than men \u2014
p351
aVis that unfolding the secrets of female physiology
p352
aVand understanding that
p353
aVis going to help men and women.
p354
aVSo this is not a zero-sum game in anyway.
p355
aa(lp356
VOkay, so here's where we started.
p357
aVAnd remember, paths crossed in 1984,
p358
aVand more and more women
p359
aVwere dying of cardiovascular disease.
p360
aVWhat has happened in the last 15 years with this work?
p361
aVWe are bending the curve.
p362
aVWe're bending the curve.
p363
aVSo just like the breast cancer story,
p364
aVdoing research, getting awareness going,
p365
aVit works, you just have to get it going.
p366
aVNow are we happy with this?
p367
aVWe still have two to three more women dying for every man.
p368
aa(lp369
VAnd I would propose,
p370
aVwith the better longevity
p371
aVthat women have overall,
p372
aVthat women probably should theoretically do better,
p373
aVif we could just get treated.
p374
aVSo this is where we are,
p375
aVbut we have a long row to hoe.
p376
aVWe've worked on this for 15 years.
p377
aVAnd I've told you, we've been working on male-pattern heart disease
p378
aVfor 50 years.
p379
aVSo we're 35 years behind.
p380
aVAnd we'd like to think it's not going to take 35 years.
p381
aVAnd in fact, it probably won't.
p382
aVBut we cannot stop now.
p383
aVToo many lives are at stake.
p384
aa(lp385
VSo what do we need to do?
p386
aVYou now, hopefully, have a more personal relationship
p387
aVwith your heart.
p388
aVWomen have heard the call
p389
aVfor breast cancer
p390
aVand they have come out
p391
aVfor awareness campaigns.
p392
aVThe women are very good about getting mammograms now.
p393
aVAnd women do fundraising.
p394
aVWomen participate.
p395
aVThey have put their money where their mouth is
p396
aVand they have done advocacy and they have joined campaigns.
p397
aVThis is what we need to do with heart disease now.
p398
aa(lp399
VAnd it's political.
p400
aVWomen's health, from a federal funding standpoint,
p401
aVsometimes it's popular,
p402
aVsometimes it's not so popular.
p403
aVSo we have these feast and famine cycles.
p404
aVSo I implore you
p405
aVto join the Red Dress Campaign
p406
aVin this fundraising.
p407
aVBreast cancer, as we said,
p408
aVkills women,
p409
aVbut heart disease kills a whole bunch more.
p410
aVSo if we can be as good as breast cancer
p411
aVand give women this new charge,
p412
aVwe have a lot of lives to save.
p413
aa(lp414
VSo thank you for your attention.
