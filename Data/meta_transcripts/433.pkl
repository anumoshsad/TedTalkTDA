VThis is a wheat bread, a whole wheat bread,
p4
aVand it's made with a new technique
p5
aVthat I've been playing around with,
p6
aVand developing and writing about which, for lack of a better name,
p7
aVwe call the epoxy method.
p8
aVAnd I call it an epoxy method because \u2014
p9
aVit's not very appetizing. I understand that \u2014
p10
aVbut \u2014 but
p11
aVif you think about epoxy, what's epoxy?
p12
aVIt's two resins that are, sort of,
p13
aVin and of themselves \u2014 neither of which can make glue,
p14
aVbut when you put the two together,
p15
aVsomething happens. A bond takes place,
p16
aVand you get this very strong, powerful
p17
aVadhesive.
p18
aVWell, in this technique,
p19
aVwhat I've tried to do is kind of
p20
aVgather all of the knowledge that the bread-baking world,
p21
aVthe artisan bread-baking community,
p22
aVhas been trying to accumulate over the last 20 years or so \u2014
p23
aVsince we've been engaged in a bread renaissance in America \u2014
p24
aVand put it together to come up with a method
p25
aVthat would help to take whole-grain breads.
p26
aVAnd let's face it, everyone's trying to move towards whole grains.
p27
aVWe finally, after 40 years of knowing
p28
aVthat wholegrain was a healthier option,
p29
aVwe're finally getting to the point where we actually are tipping over
p30
aVand attempting to actually eat them.
p31
aa(lp32
V(Laughter)
p33
aa(lp34
VThe challenge, though, for a wholegrain baker is,
p35
aVyou know, how do you make it taste good?
p36
aVBecause whole grain \u2014 it's easy with white flour
p37
aVto make a good-tasting bread. White flour is sweet.
p38
aVIt's mainly starch, and starch, when you break it down \u2014
p39
aVwhat is starch? It's \u2014 thank you \u2014 sugar, yes.
p40
aVSo a baker, and a good baker,
p41
aVknows how to pull or draw forth
p42
aVthe inherent sugar trapped in the starch.
p43
aVWith whole grain bread, you have other obstacles.
p44
aVYou've got bran, which is probably the healthiest part of the bread for us,
p45
aVor the fiber for us because it is just loaded with fiber,
p46
aVfor the bran is fiber.
p47
aVIt's got germ. Those are the good things,
p48
aVbut those aren't the tastiest parts of the wheat.
p49
aVSo whole grain breads historically
p50
aVhave had sort of this onus of being health food breads,
p51
aVand people don't like to eat,
p52
aVquote, health food. They like to eat healthy and healthily,
p53
aVbut when we think of something as a health food,
p54
aVwe think of it as something we eat out of obligation,
p55
aVnot out of passion and love for the flavor.
p56
aa(lp57
VAnd ultimately, the challenge of the baker,
p58
aVthe challenge of every culinary student, of every chef,
p59
aVis to deliver flavor.
p60
aVFlavor is king. Flavor rules.
p61
aVI call it the flavor rule. Flavor rules.
p62
aVAnd \u2014 and
p63
aVyou can get somebody to eat something that's good for them once,
p64
aVbut they won't eat it again if they don't like it, right?
p65
aVSo, this is the challenge for this bread.
p66
aVWe're going to try this at lunch, and
p67
aVI'll explain a bit more about it,
p68
aVbut it's made not only with two types of pre-doughs \u2014
p69
aVthis attempt, again, at bringing out flavor
p70
aVis to make a piece of dough
p71
aVthe day before that is not leavened.
p72
aVIt's just dough that is wet.
p73
aVIt's hydrated dough we call "the soaker" \u2014
p74
aVthat helps to start enzyme activity.
p75
aVAnd enzymes are the secret, kind of, ingredient in dough
p76
aVthat brings out flavor.
p77
aVIt starts to release the sugars trapped in the starch.
p78
aVThat's what enzymes are doing.
p79
aVAnd so, if we can release some of those,
p80
aVthey become accessible to us in our palate.
p81
aVThey become accessible to the yeast as food.
p82
aVThey become accessible to the oven for caramelization
p83
aVto give us a beautiful crust.
p84
aa(lp85
VThe other pre-dough
p86
aVthat we make is fermented \u2014 our pre-ferment.
p87
aVAnd it's made \u2014 it can be a sourdough starter, or what we call a "biga"
p88
aVor any other kind of pre-fermented dough with a little yeast in it,
p89
aVand that starts to develop flavor also.
p90
aVAnd on day two, we put those two pieces together. That's the epoxy.
p91
aVAnd we're hoping that, sort of, the
p92
aVenzyme piece of dough
p93
aVbecomes the fuel pack for the leavened piece of dough,
p94
aVand when we put them together and add the final ingredients,
p95
aVwe can create a bread that does evoke
p96
aVthe full potential of flavor trapped in the grain.
p97
aVThat's the challenge. Okay, so, now, what we \u2014
p98
aVin the journey of wheat, let's go back and look at these 12 stages.
p99
aa(lp100
VI'm going to go through them very quickly and then revisit them.
p101
aVOkay, we're going to start with the first stage.
p102
aVAnd this is what every student has to begin with.
p103
aVEveryone who works in the culinary world knows that
p104
aVthe first stage of cooking is "mise en place,"
p105
aVwhich is just a French way of saying, "get organized."
p106
aVEverything in its place. First stage.
p107
aVSo in baking we call it scaling \u2014 weighing out the ingredients.
p108
aVStage two is mixing. We take the ingredients and we mix them.
p109
aVWe have to develop the gluten.
p110
aVThere's no gluten in flour. There's only the potential for gluten.
p111
aVHere's another kind of prefiguring of epoxy
p112
aVbecause we've got glutenin and gliadin,
p113
aVneither of which are strong enough to make a good bread.
p114
aVBut when they get hydrated and they bond to each other,
p115
aVthey create a stronger molecule, a stronger protein we call gluten.
p116
aVAnd so we, in the mixing process,
p117
aVhave to develop the gluten,
p118
aVwe have to activate the leaven or the yeast,
p119
aVand we have to essentially distribute all the ingredients evenly.
p120
aa(lp121
VThen we get into fermentation, the third stage,
p122
aVwhich is really where the flavor develops.
p123
aVThe yeast comes alive and starts eating the sugars,
p124
aVcreating carbon dioxide and alcohol \u2014
p125
aVessentially it's burping and sweating, which is what bread is.
p126
aVIt's yeast burps and sweat.
p127
aVAnd somehow, this is transformed \u2014
p128
aVthe yeast burps and sweats are later transformed \u2014
p129
aVand this is really getting to the heart of what makes bread so special
p130
aVis that it is a transformational food,
p131
aVand we're going to explore that in a minute.
p132
aVBut then, quickly through the next few stages.
p133
aVWe, after it's fermented and it's developed,
p134
aVstarted to develop flavor and character,
p135
aVwe divide it into smaller units.
p136
aVAnd then we take those units and we shape them. We give them a little pre-shape,
p137
aVusually a round or a little torpedo shape, sometimes.
p138
aVThat's called "rounding."
p139
aa(lp140
VAnd there's a short rest period. It can be for a few seconds.
p141
aVIt can be for 20 or 30 minutes. We call that resting or benching.
p142
aVThen we go into final shaping,
p143
aV"panning" \u2014 which means putting the shaped loaf on a pan.
p144
aVThis takes a second, but it's a distinctive stage.
p145
aVIt can be in a basket. It can be in a loaf pan, but we pan it.
p146
aVAnd then, stage nine.
p147
aVThe fermentation which started at stage three is continuing
p148
aVthrough all these other stages. Again, developing more flavor.
p149
aVThe final fermentation takes place in stage nine.
p150
aVWe call it "proofing."
p151
aVProofing means to prove that the dough is alive.
p152
aVAnd at stage nine we get the dough to the final shape,
p153
aVand it goes into the oven \u2014 stage 10.
p154
aVThree transformations take place in the oven.
p155
aVThe sugars in the dough caramelize in the crust.
p156
aVThey give us that beautiful brown crust.
p157
aVOnly the crust can caramelize. It's the only place that gets hot enough.
p158
aVInside, the proteins \u2014
p159
aVthis gluten \u2014 coagulates.
p160
aVWhen it gets to about 160 degrees,
p161
aVthe proteins all line up  and they create structure,
p162
aVthe gluten structure \u2014
p163
aVwhat ultimately we will call the crumb of the bread.
p164
aVAnd the starches, when they reach about 180 degrees,
p165
aVgelatinize.
p166
aa(lp167
VAnd gelatinization is yet another
p168
aVoven transformation.
p169
aVCoagulation, caramelization and gelatinization \u2014
p170
aVwhen the starch is thick and they absorb all the moisture that's around them,
p171
aVthey \u2014 they kind of swell, and then they burst.
p172
aVAnd they burst, and they spill their guts into the bread.
p173
aVSo basically now we're eating yeast sweats \u2014
p174
aVsweat, burps and starch guts.
p175
aVAgain, transformed in stage 10 in the oven
p176
aVbecause what went into the oven as dough
p177
aVcomes out in stage 11 as bread.
p178
aVAnd stage 11, we call it cooling \u2014
p179
aVbecause we never really eat the bread right away.
p180
aVThere's a little carry-over baking.
p181
aVThe proteins have to set up, strengthen and firm up.
p182
aVAnd then we have stage 12, which the textbooks call "packaging,"
p183
aVbut my students call "eating."
p184
aVAnd so, we're going to be on our own journey today from wheat to eat,
p185
aVand in a few minutes we will try this,
p186
aVand see if we have succeeded
p187
aVin fulfilling this baker's mission of pulling out flavor.
p188
aa(lp189
VBut I want to go back now and revisit these steps,
p190
aVand talk about it from the standpoint of transformation,
p191
aVbecause I really believe that
p192
aVall things can be understood \u2014
p193
aVand this is not my own idea. This goes back to the Scholastics and to the Ancients \u2014
p194
aVthat all things can be understood on four levels:
p195
aVthe literal, the metaphoric or poetic level,
p196
aVthe political or ethical level.
p197
aVAnd ultimately, the mystical or sometimes called the "anagogical" level.
p198
aVIt's hard to get to those levels unless you go through the literal.
p199
aVIn fact, Dante says you can't understand the three deeper levels
p200
aVunless you first understand the literal level,
p201
aVso that's why we're talking literally about bread.
p202
aVBut let's kind of look at these stages again
p203
aVfrom the standpoint of connections to possibly a deeper level \u2014
p204
aVall in my quest for answering the question,
p205
aV"What is it about bread that's so special?"
p206
aVAnd fulfilling this mission of evoking the full potential of flavor.
p207
aa(lp208
VBecause what happens is,
p209
aVbread begins as wheat or any other grain.
p210
aVBut what's wheat? Wheat is a grass
p211
aVthat grows in the field.
p212
aVAnd, like all grasses, at a certain point it puts out seeds.
p213
aVAnd we harvest those seeds, and those are the wheat kernels.
p214
aVNow, in order to harvest it \u2014 I mean, what's harvesting?
p215
aVIt's just a euphemism for killing, right?
p216
aVI mean, that's what's harvest \u2014 we say we harvest the pig, you know?
p217
aVYes, we slaughter, you know. Yes, that's life.
p218
aVWe harvest the wheat,
p219
aVand in harvesting it, we kill it.
p220
aVNow, wheat is alive,
p221
aVand as we harvest it, it gives up its seeds.
p222
aVNow, at least with seeds we have the potential for future life.
p223
aVWe can plant those in the ground.
p224
aVAnd we save some of those for the next generation.
p225
aVBut most of those seeds get crushed
p226
aVand turned into flour.
p227
aVAnd at that point, the wheat has suffered the ultimate indignity.
p228
aVIt's not only been killed,
p229
aVbut it's been denied any potential for creating future life.
p230
aVSo we turn it into flour.
p231
aa(lp232
VSo as I said, I think bread is a transformational food.
p233
aVThe first transformation \u2014 and, by the way,
p234
aVthe definition of transformation for me is
p235
aVa radical change from one thing into something else.
p236
aVO.K.? Radical, not subtle.
p237
aVNot like hot water made cold,
p238
aVor cold water turned hot,
p239
aVbut water boiled off and becoming steam.
p240
aVThat's a transformation, two different things.
p241
aVWell, in this case, the first transformation
p242
aVis alive to dead.
p243
aVI'd call that radical.
p244
aVSo, we've got now this flour.
p245
aVAnd what do we do? We add some water.
p246
aVIn stage one, we weigh it.
p247
aVIn stage two, we add water and salt to it, mix it together,
p248
aVand we create something that we call "clay."
p249
aVIt's like clay.
p250
aVAnd we infuse that clay
p251
aVwith an ingredient that we call "leaven."
p252
aVIn this case, it's yeast, but yeast is leaven. What does leaven mean?
p253
aVLeaven comes from the root word that means enliven \u2014
p254
aVto vivify, to bring to life.
p255
aVBy the way, what's the Hebrew word for clay? Adam.
p256
aVYou see, the baker, in this moment,
p257
aVhas become, in a sense,
p258
aVsort of, the God of his dough, you know, and his dough, well,
p259
aVwhile it's not an intelligent life form, is now alive.
p260
aVAnd we know it's alive because in stage three,
p261
aVit grows. Growth is the proof of life.
p262
aa(lp263
VAnd while it's growing, all these
p264
aVliteral transformations are taking place.
p265
aVEnzymes are breaking forth sugars.
p266
aVYeast is eating sugar and
p267
aVturning it into carbon dioxide and alcohol.
p268
aVBacteria is in there, eating the same sugars,
p269
aVturning them into acids.
p270
aVIn other words, personality and character's being developed in this dough
p271
aVunder the watchful gaze of the baker.
p272
aVAnd the baker's choices all along the way
p273
aVdetermine the outcome of the product.
p274
aVA subtle change in temperature \u2014 a subtle change in time \u2014
p275
aVit's all about a balancing act between time, temperature
p276
aVand ingredients. That's the art of baking.
p277
aVSo all these things are determined by the baker,
p278
aVand the bread goes through some stages, and characters develop.
p279
aVAnd then we divide it, and this one big piece of dough
p280
aVis divided into smaller units, and each of those units
p281
aVare given shape by the baker.
p282
aVAnd as they're shaped, they're raised again,
p283
aVall along proving that they're alive,
p284
aVand developing character.
p285
aa(lp286
VAnd at stage 10, we take it to the oven.
p287
aVIt's still dough. Nobody eats bread dough \u2014
p288
aVa few people do, I think, but not too many.
p289
aVI've met some dough eaters, but \u2014
p290
aVit's not the staff of life, right? Bread is the staff of life.
p291
aVBut dough is what we're working with,
p292
aVand we take that dough to the oven,
p293
aVand it goes into the oven. As soon as the interior temperature of that dough
p294
aVcrosses the threshold of 140 degrees,
p295
aVit passes what we call the "thermal death point."
p296
aVStudents love that TDP. They think it's the name of a video game.
p297
aVBut it's the thermal death point \u2014 all life ceases there.
p298
aVThe yeast, whose mission it has been up till now to raise the dough,
p299
aVto enliven it, to vivify it,
p300
aVin order to complete its mission,
p301
aVwhich is also to turn this dough into bread,
p302
aVhas to give up its life.
p303
aVSo you see the symbolism at work? It's starting to come forth a little bit, you know.
p304
aVIt's starting to make sense to me \u2014
p305
aVwhat goes in is dough,
p306
aVwhat comes out is bread \u2014
p307
aVor it goes in alive,
p308
aVcomes out dead.
p309
aVThird transformation. First transformation, alive to dead.
p310
aVSecond transformation, dead brought back to life.
p311
aVThird transformation, alive to dead \u2014
p312
aVbut dough to bread.
p313
aa(lp314
VOr another analogy would be,
p315
aVa caterpillar has been turned into a butterfly.
p316
aVAnd it's what comes out of the oven
p317
aVthat is what we call the staff of life.
p318
aVThis is the product
p319
aVthat
p320
aVeveryone in the world eats, that is so difficult to give up.
p321
aVIt's so
p322
aVdeeply embedded in our psyches that
p323
aVbread is used as a symbol for life.
p324
aVIt's used as a symbol for transformation.
p325
aVAnd so, as we get to stage 12 and we partake of that,
p326
aVagain completing the life cycle,
p327
aVyou know, we have a chance to essentially ingest that \u2014
p328
aVit nurtures us, and we continue to carry on
p329
aVand have opportunities to ponder
p330
aVthings like this.
p331
aVSo this is what I've learned from bread.
p332
aVThis is what bread has taught me in my journey.
p333
aVAnd what we're going to attempt to do
p334
aVwith this bread here, again,
p335
aVis to use, in addition to everything we talked about,
p336
aVthis bread we're going to call "spent grain bread"
p337
aVbecause, as you know, bread-making is very similar to beer-making.
p338
aVBeer is basically liquid bread,
p339
aVor bread is solid beer.
p340
aVAnd \u2014
p341
aV(Laughter)
p342
aVthey \u2014 they're invented around the same time. I think beer came first.
p343
aVAnd the Egyptian who was tending the beer fell asleep
p344
aVin the hot, Egyptian sun, and it turned into bread.
p345
aa(lp346
VBut we've got this bread,
p347
aVand what I did here is to try to, again,
p348
aVevoke even more flavor from this grain,
p349
aVwas we've added into it the spent grain from beer-making.
p350
aVAnd if you make this bread, you can use any kind of spent grain from any type of beer.
p351
aVI like dark spent grain. Today we're using a light spent grain
p352
aVthat's actually from, like, some kind of a lager of some sort \u2014
p353
aVa light lager or an ale \u2014 that is wheat and barley that's been toasted.
p354
aVIn other words, the beer-maker knows also how to evoke flavor from the grains
p355
aVby using sprouting and malting and roasting.
p356
aVWe're going to take some of that, and put it into the bread.
p357
aVSo now we not only have a high-fiber bread,
p358
aVbut now fiber on top of fiber.
p359
aVAnd so this is, again, hopefully
p360
aVnot only a healthy bread,
p361
aVbut a bread that you will enjoy.
p362
aVSo, if I, kind of, break this bread,
p363
aVmaybe we can share this now a little bit here.
p364
aVWe'll start a little piece here,
p365
aVand I'm going to take a little piece here \u2014
p366
aVI think I'd better taste it myself before you have it at lunch.
p367
aVI'll leave you
p368
aVwith what I call the baker's blessing.
p369
aVMay your crust be crisp,
p370
aVand your bread always rise.
p371
aVThank you.
