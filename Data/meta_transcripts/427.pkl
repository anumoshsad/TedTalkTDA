(lp3
VI'm kind of tired of talking about simplicity, actually,
p4
aVso I thought I'd make my life more complex, as a serious play.
p5
aVSo, I'm going to, like, go through some slides
p6
aVfrom way back when,
p7
aVand walk through them to give you a sense of how I end up here.
p8
aa(lp9
VSo, basically it all began with
p10
aVthis whole idea of a computer.
p11
aVWho has a computer? Yeah.
p12
aVO.K., so, everyone has a computer.
p13
aVEven a mobile phone, it's a computer.
p14
aVAnd \u2014 anyone remember this workbook,
p15
aV"Instant Activities for Your Apple" \u2014
p16
aVfree poster in each book?
p17
aVThis was how computing began.
p18
aVDon't forget: a computer came out; it had no software.
p19
aVYou'd buy that thing, you'd bring it home, you'd plug it in,
p20
aVand it would do absolutely nothing at all.
p21
aVSo, you had to program it,
p22
aVand there were great programming, like, tutorials, like this.
p23
aVI mean, this was great.
p24
aVIt's, like, you know, Herbie the Apple II.
p25
aVIt's such a great way to \u2014
p26
aVI mean, they should make Java books like this,
p27
aVand we've have no problem learning a program.
p28
aVBut this was a great, grand time of the computer,
p29
aVwhen it was just a raw, raw, what is it? kind of an era.
p30
aVAnd, you see,
p31
aVthis era coincided with my own childhood.
p32
aa(lp33
VI grew up in a tofu factory in Seattle.
p34
aVWho of you grew up in a family business,
p35
aVsuffered the torture? Yes, yes.
p36
aVThe torture was good. Wasn't it good torture?
p37
aVIt was just life-changing, you know. And so, in my life, you know, I was in the tofu;
p38
aVit was a family business.
p39
aVAnd my mother was a kind of a designer, also.
p40
aVShe'd make this kind of, like, wall of tofu cooking,
p41
aVand it would confuse the customers,
p42
aVbecause they all thought it was a restaurant.
p43
aVA bad sort of branding thing, or whatever.
p44
aVBut, anyway, that's where I grew up,
p45
aVin this little tofu factory in Seattle,
p46
aVand it was kind of like this:
p47
aVa small room where I kind of grew up. I'm big there in that picture.
p48
aa(lp49
VThat's my dad. My dad was kind of like MacGyver, really:
p50
aVhe would invent, like, ways to make things heavy.
p51
aVLike back here, there's like, concrete block technology here,
p52
aVand he would need the concrete blocks to press the tofu,
p53
aVbecause tofu is actually kind of a liquidy type of thing,
p54
aVand so you have to have heavy stuff
p55
aVto push out the liquid and make it hard.
p56
aVTofu comes out in these big batches,
p57
aVand my father would sort of cut them by hand.
p58
aVI can't tell you \u2014 family business story: you'd understand this \u2014
p59
aVmy father was the most sincere man possible.
p60
aVHe walked into a Safeway once on a rainy day,
p61
aVslipped, broke his arm, rushed out:
p62
aVhe didn't want to inconvenience Safeway.
p63
aVSo, instead, you know, my father's, like, arm's broken
p64
aVfor two weeks in the store, and that week \u2014
p65
aVnow, those two weeks were when my older brother and I
p66
aVhad to do everything.
p67
aVAnd that was torture, real torture.
p68
aVBecause, you see, we'd seen my father
p69
aVtaking the big block of tofu and cutting it,
p70
aVlike, knife in, zap, zap, zap. We thought, wow.
p71
aVSo, the first time I did that, I went, like, whoa! Like this.
p72
aVBad blocks. But anyways,
p73
aVthe tofu to me was kind of my origin, basically.
p74
aVAnd because working in a store was so hard,
p75
aVI liked going to school; it was like heaven.
p76
aVAnd I was really good at school.
p77
aa(lp78
VSo, when I got to MIT, you know,
p79
aVas most of you who are creatives,
p80
aVyour parents all told you not to be creative, right?
p81
aVSo, same way, you know,
p82
aVI was good at art and good at math, and my father says, he's \u2014
p83
aVJohn's good at math.
p84
aVI went to MIT, did my math,
p85
aVbut I had this wonderful opportunity,
p86
aVbecause computers had just become visual.
p87
aVThe Apple \u2014 Macintosh just came out;
p88
aVI had a Mac in hand when I went to MIT.
p89
aVAnd it was a time when a guy who, kind of,
p90
aVcould cross the two sides \u2014
p91
aVit was a good time.
p92
aa(lp93
VAnd so, I remember that my first major piece of software
p94
aVwas on a direct copy of then-Aldus PageMaker.
p95
aVI made a desktop publishing system way back when,
p96
aVand that was, kind of, my first step into figuring out how to \u2014
p97
aVoh, these two sides are kind of fun to mix.
p98
aVAnd the problem when you're younger \u2014
p99
aVfor all you students out there \u2014
p100
aVis, your head gets kind of big really easy.
p101
aVAnd when I was making icons, I was, like,
p102
aVthe icon master,
p103
aVand I was, like, yeah, I'm really good at this, you know.
p104
aVAnd then luckily, you know,
p105
aVI had the fortune of going to something called a library,
p106
aVand in the library I came upon this very book.
p107
aVI found this book. It's called,
p108
aV"Thoughts on Design," by a man named Paul Rand.
p109
aVIt's a little slim volume; I'm not sure if you've seen this.
p110
aVIt's a very nice little book. It's about this guy, Paul Rand,
p111
aVwho was one of the greatest graphic designers,
p112
aVand also a great writer as well.
p113
aVAnd when I saw this man's work,
p114
aVI realized how bad I was at design,
p115
aVor whatever I called it back then,
p116
aVand I suddenly had a kind of career goal,
p117
aVkind of in hot pursuit.
p118
aa(lp119
VSo I kind of switched. I went to MIT, finished.
p120
aVI got my masters, and then went to art school after that.
p121
aVAnd just began to design stuff,
p122
aVlike chopstick wrappers, napkins, menus \u2014 whatever I could get a handle on:
p123
aVsort of wheel-and-deal, move up in the design world, whatever.
p124
aVAnd isn't it that strange moment when you publish your design?
p125
aVRemember that moment \u2014 publishing your designs?
p126
aVRemember that moment? It felt so good, didn't it?
p127
aVSo, I was published, you know,
p128
aVso, wow, my design's in a book, you know?
p129
aVAfter that, things kind of got strange,
p130
aVand I got thinking about the computer,
p131
aVbecause the computer to me always, kind of, bothered me.
p132
aVI didn't quite get it. And Paul Rand
p133
aVwas a kind of crusty designer,
p134
aVyou know, a crusty designer, like a good \u2014 kind of like a good French bread?
p135
aVYou know, he wrote in one of his books:
p136
aV"A Yale student once said,
p137
aV'I came here to learn how to design, not how to use a computer.'
p138
aVDesign schools take heed."
p139
aVThis is in the '80s,
p140
aVin the great clash of computer/non-computer people.
p141
aVA very difficult time, actually.
p142
aVAnd this to me was an important message from Rand.
p143
aa(lp144
VAnd so I began to sort of mess with the computer at the time.
p145
aVThis is the first sort of play thing I did, my own serious play.
p146
aVI built a working version of an Adobe Illustrator-ish thing.
p147
aVIt looks like Illustrator; it can, like, draw.
p148
aVIt was very hard to make this, actually.
p149
aVIt took a month to make this part.
p150
aVAnd then I thought, what if I added this feature,
p151
aVwhere I can say, this point,
p152
aVyou can fly like a bird. You're free, kind of thing.
p153
aVSo I could, sort of, change the kind of stability
p154
aVwith a little control there on the dial,
p155
aVand I can sort of watch it flip around.
p156
aVAnd this is in 1993.
p157
aVAnd when my professors saw this, they were very upset at me.
p158
aVThey were saying, Why's it moving?
p159
aVThey were saying, Make it stop now.
p160
aVNow, I was saying, Well, that's the whole point: it's moving.
p161
aVAnd he says, Well, when's it going to stop?
p162
aVAnd I said, Never.
p163
aVAnd he said, Even worse. Stop it now.
p164
aVI started studying this whole idea,
p165
aVof like, what is this computer? It's a strange medium.
p166
aVIt's not like print. It's not like video.
p167
aVIt lasts forever. It's a very strange medium.
p168
aVSo, I went off with this,
p169
aVand began to look for things even more.
p170
aa(lp171
VAnd so in Japan, I began to experiment with people.
p172
aVThis is actually bad: human experiments.
p173
aVI would do these things where I'd have students become pens:
p174
aVthere's blue pen, red pen, green pen, black pen.
p175
aVAnd someone sits down and draws a picture.
p176
aVThey're laughing because he said,
p177
aVdraw from the middle-right to the middle, and he kind of messed up.
p178
aVSee, humans don't know how to take orders;
p179
aVthe computer's so good at it.
p180
aVThis guy figured out how to get the computer to draw with two pens at once:
p181
aVyou know, you, pen, do this, and you, pen, do this.
p182
aVAnd so began to have multiple pens on the page \u2014
p183
aVagain, hard to do with our hands.
p184
aVAnd then someone discovered this "a-ha moment"
p185
aVwhere you could use coordinate systems.
p186
aVWe thought, ah, this is when it's going to happen.
p187
aVIn the end, he drew a house. It was the most boring thing.
p188
aVIt became computerish; we began to think computerish \u2014
p189
aVthe X, Y system \u2014 and so that was kind of a revelation.
p190
aa(lp191
VAnd after this I wanted to build a computer out of people,
p192
aVcalled a human-powered computer.
p193
aVSo, this happened in 1993.
p194
aVSound down, please.
p195
aVIt's a computer where the people are the parts.
p196
aVI have behind this wall a disk drive, a CPU,
p197
aVa graphics card, a memory system.
p198
aVThey're picking up a giant floppy disk made of cardboard.
p199
aVIt's put inside the computer.
p200
aVAnd that little program's on that cardboard disk.
p201
aVSo, she wears the disk,
p202
aVand reads the data off the sectors of the disk,
p203
aVand the computer starts up; it sort of boots up, really.
p204
aVAnd it's a sort of a working computer. And when I built this computer,
p205
aVI had a moment of \u2014 what is it called? \u2014
p206
aVthe epiphany where I realized that the computer's just so fast.
p207
aVThis computer appears to be fast - she's working pretty hard,
p208
aVand people are running around, and we think, wow, this is happening at a fast rate.
p209
aVAnd this computer's programmed to do only one thing, which is,
p210
aVif you move your mouse, the mouse changes on the screen.
p211
aVOn the computer, when you move your mouse, that arrow moves around.
p212
aVOn this computer, if you move the mouse, it takes half an hour
p213
aVfor the mouse cursor to change.
p214
aVTo give you a sense of the speed, the scale:
p215
aVthe computer is just so amazingly fast, O.K.?
p216
aa(lp217
VAnd so, after this I began to do experiments for different companies.
p218
aVThis is something I did for Sony in 1996.
p219
aVIt was three Sony "H" devices
p220
aVthat responded to sound.
p221
aVSo, if you talk into the mike,
p222
aVyou'll hear some music in your headphones;
p223
aVif you talk in the phone, then video would happen.
p224
aVSo, I began to experiment with industry in different ways
p225
aVwith this kind of mixture of skills.
p226
aVI did this ad. I don't believe in this kind of alcohol, but I do drink sometimes.
p227
aVAnd Chanel. So, getting to do different projects.
p228
aa(lp229
VAnd also, one thing I realized is that
p230
aVI like to make things.
p231
aVWe like to make things. It's fun to make things.
p232
aVAnd so I never developed the ability to have a staff.
p233
aVI have no staff; it's all kind of made by hand \u2014
p234
aVthese sort of broken hands.
p235
aVAnd these hands were influenced
p236
aVby this man, Mr. Inami Naomi.
p237
aVThis guy was my kind of like mentor.
p238
aVHe was the first digital media producer in Tokyo.
p239
aVHe's the guy that kind of discovered me,
p240
aVand kind of got me going in digital media.
p241
aVHe was such an inspirational guy.
p242
aVI remember, like, we'd be in his studio, like, at 2 a.m.,
p243
aVand then he'd show up from some client meeting.
p244
aVHe'd come in and say, you know,
p245
aVIf I am here, everything is okay.
p246
aVAnd you'd feel so much better, you know.
p247
aVAnd I'll never forget how, like, but \u2014 I'll never forget how, like,
p248
aVhe had a sudden situation with his \u2014 he had an aneurysm.
p249
aVHe went into a coma.
p250
aVAnd so, for three years he was out, and he could only blink,
p251
aVand so I realized at this moment, I thought, wow \u2014
p252
aVhow fragile is this thing we're wearing,
p253
aVthis body and mind we're wearing,
p254
aVand so I thought, How do you go for it more?
p255
aVHow do you take that time you have left and go after it?
p256
aVSo, Naomi was pivotal in that.
p257
aa(lp258
VAnd so, I began to think more carefully about the computer.
p259
aVThis was a moment where I was thinking about,
p260
aVso, you have a computer program,
p261
aVit responds to motion \u2014 X and Y \u2014
p262
aVand I realized that each computer program
p263
aVhas all these images inside the program.
p264
aVSo, if you can see here, you know,
p265
aVthat program you're seeing in the corner,
p266
aVif you spread it out, it's all these things all at once.
p267
aVIt's real simultaneity. It's nothing we're used to working with.
p268
aVWe're so used to working in one vector.
p269
aVThis is all at the same time.
p270
aVThe computer lives in so many dimensions.
p271
aVAnd also, at the same time I was frustrated,
p272
aVbecause I would go to all these art and design schools everywhere,
p273
aVand there were these, like, "the computer lab," you know,
p274
aVand this is, like, in the late 1990s,
p275
aVand this is in Basel,
p276
aVa great graphic design school.
p277
aVAnd here's this, like, dirty, kind of, shoddy,
p278
aVkind of, dark computer room.
p279
aVAnd I began to wonder, Is this the goal?
p280
aVIs this what we want, you know?
p281
aa(lp282
VAnd also, I began to be fascinated by machines \u2014
p283
aVyou know, like copy machines \u2014 and so this is actually in Basel.
p284
aVI noticed how we spent so much time on making it interactive \u2014
p285
aVthis is, like, a touch screen \u2014
p286
aVand I noticed how you can only touch five places,
p287
aVand so, "why are we wasting so much interactivity everywhere?"
p288
aVbecame a question. And also, the sound:
p289
aVI discovered I can make my ThinkPad pretend it's a telephone.
p290
aVYou get it? No? O.K.
p291
aVAnd also, I discovered in Logan airport,
p292
aVthis was, like, calling out to me.
p293
aVDo you hear that? It's like cows. This is at 4 a.m. at Logan.
p294
aa(lp295
VSo, I was wondering, like,
p296
aVwhat is this thing in front of me, this computer thing?
p297
aVIt didn't make any sense.
p298
aVSo, I began to make things again. This is another series of objects
p299
aVmade of old computers from my basement.
p300
aVI made \u2014 I took my old Macintoshes
p301
aVand made different objects out of them from Tokyo.
p302
aVI began to be very disinterested in computers themselves,
p303
aVso I began to make paintings out of PalmPilots.
p304
aVI made this series of works.
p305
aVThey're paintings I made and put a PalmPilot in the middle
p306
aVas a kind of display that's sort of thinking,
p307
aVI'm abstract art. What am I? I'm abstract.
p308
aVAnd so it keeps thinking out loud of its own abstraction.
p309
aa(lp310
VI began to be fascinated by plastic,
p311
aVso I spent four months making eight plastic blocks
p312
aVperfectly optically transparent,
p313
aVas a kind of release of stress.
p314
aVBecause of that, I became interested in blue tape,
p315
aVso in San Francisco, at C.C., I had a whole exhibition on blue tape.
p316
aVI made a whole installation out of blue tape \u2014 blue painters' tape.
p317
aVAnd at this point my wife kind of got worried about me,
p318
aVso I stopped doing blue tape and began to think,
p319
aVWell, what else is there in life?
p320
aVAnd so computers, as you know,
p321
aVthese big computers, there are now tiny computers.
p322
aVThey're littler computers, so the one-chip computers,
p323
aVI began to program one-chip computers
p324
aVand make objects out of P.C. boards, LEDs.
p325
aVI began to make LED sculptures
p326
aVthat would live inside little boxes out of MDF.
p327
aVThis is a series of light boxes I made for a show in Italy.
p328
aVVery simple boxes: you just press one button and some LED interaction occurs.
p329
aVThis is a series of lamps I made. This is a Bento box lamp:
p330
aVit's sort of a plastic rice lamp;
p331
aVit's very friendly.
p332
aVI did a show in London last year made out of iPods \u2014
p333
aVI used iPods as a material.
p334
aVSo I took 16 iPod Nanos
p335
aVand made a kind of a Nano fish, basically.
p336
aVRecently, this is for Reebok.
p337
aVI've done shoes for Reebok as well,
p338
aVas a kind of a hobby for apparel.
p339
aa(lp340
VSo anyways, there are all these things you can do,
p341
aVbut the thing I love the most is to
p342
aVexperience, taste the world.
p343
aVThe world is just so tasty.
p344
aVWe think we'll go to a museum; that's where all the tastes are.
p345
aVNo, they're all out there.
p346
aVSo, this is, like, in front of the Eiffel Tower, really,
p347
aVactually, around the Louvre area.
p348
aVThis I found, where nature had made a picture for me.
p349
aVThis is a perfect 90-degree angle by nature.
p350
aVIn this strange moment where, like, these things kind of appeared.
p351
aVWe all are creative people.
p352
aVWe have this gene defect in our mind.
p353
aVWe can't help but stop, right? This feeling's a wonderful thing.
p354
aVIt's the forever-always-on museum.
p355
aVThis is from the Cape last year.
p356
aVI discovered that I had to find the equation of art and design,
p357
aVwhich we know as circle-triangle-square.
p358
aVIt's everywhere on the beach, I discovered.
p359
aVI began to collect every instance of circle-triangle-square.
p360
aVI put these all back, by the way.
p361
aVAnd I also discovered how .
p362
aVsome rocks are twins separated at birth.
p363
aVThis is also out there, you know.
p364
aVI'm, like, how did this happen, kind of thing?
p365
aVI brought you guys together again.
p366
aa(lp367
VSo, three years ago I discovered, the letters M-I-T
p368
aVoccurring in simplicity and complexity.
p369
aVMy alma mater, MIT, and I had this moment \u2014
p370
aVa kind of M. Night Shayamalan moment \u2014
p371
aVwhere I thought, Whoa! I have to do this.
p372
aVAnd I went after it with passion.
p373
aVHowever, recently this RISD opportunity kind of arose \u2014
p374
aVgoing to RISD \u2014 and I couldn't reconcile this real easy,
p375
aVbecause the letters had told me, MIT forever.
p376
aVBut I discovered in the French word raison d'être.
p377
aVI was, like, aha, wait a second.
p378
aVAnd there RISD appeared.
p379
aVAnd so I realized it was O.K. to go.
p380
aa(lp381
VSo, I'm going to RISD, actually.
p382
aVWho's a RISD alum out there?
p383
aVRISD alums? Yeah, RISD. There we go, RISD. Woo, RISD.
p384
aVI'm sorry, I'm sorry, Art Center \u2014 Art Center is good, too.
p385
aVRISD is kind of my new kind of passion,
p386
aVand I'll tell you a little bit about that.
p387
aVSo, RISD is \u2014
p388
aVI was outside RISD,
p389
aVand some student wrote this on some block, and I thought,
p390
aVWow, RISD wants to know what itself is.
p391
aVAnd I have no idea what RISD should be, actually,
p392
aVor what it wants to be, but one thing I have to tell you is that
p393
aValthough I'm a technologist, I don't like technology very much.
p394
aVIt's a, kind of, the qi thing, or whatever.
p395
aVPeople say,
p396
aVAre you going to bring RISD into the future?
p397
aVAnd I say, well, I'm going to bring the future back to RISD.
p398
aa(lp399
