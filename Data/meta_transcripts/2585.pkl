VHow much do you get paid?
p4
aVDon't answer that out loud.
p5
aVBut put a number in your head.
p6
aVNow: How much do you think the person sitting next to you gets paid?
p7
aVAgain, don't answer out loud.
p8
aa(lp9
V(Laughter)
p10
aa(lp11
VAt work, how much do you think
p12
aVthe person sitting in the cubicle or the desk next to you gets paid?
p13
aVDo you know?
p14
aVShould you know?
p15
aa(lp16
VNotice, it's a little uncomfortable for me to even ask you those questions.
p17
aVBut admit it \u2014 you kind of want to know.
p18
aVMost of us are uncomfortable with the idea of broadcasting our salary.
p19
aVWe're not supposed to tell our neighbors,
p20
aVand we're definitely not supposed to tell our office neighbors.
p21
aVThe assumed reason is that if everybody knew what everybody got paid,
p22
aVthen all hell would break loose.
p23
aVThere'd be arguments, there'd be fights,
p24
aVthere might even be a few people who quit.
p25
aVBut what if secrecy is actually the reason for all that strife?
p26
aVAnd what would happen if we removed that secrecy?
p27
aVWhat if openness actually increased the sense of fairness and collaboration
p28
aVinside a company?
p29
aVWhat would happen if we had total pay transparency?
p30
aa(lp31
VFor the past several years,
p32
aVI've been studying the corporate and entrepreneurial leaders
p33
aVwho question the conventional wisdom about how to run a company.
p34
aVAnd the question of pay keeps coming up.
p35
aVAnd the answers keep surprising.
p36
aa(lp37
VIt turns out that pay transparency \u2014
p38
aVsharing salaries openly across a company \u2014
p39
aVmakes for a better workplace for both the employee
p40
aVand for the organization.
p41
aVWhen people don't know how their pay compares to their peers',
p42
aVthey're more likely to feel underpaid
p43
aVand maybe even discriminated against.
p44
aVDo you want to work at a place that tolerates the idea
p45
aVthat you feel underpaid or discriminated against?
p46
aVBut keeping salaries secret does exactly that,
p47
aVand it's a practice as old as it is common,
p48
aVdespite the fact that in the United States,
p49
aVthe law protects an employee's right to discuss their pay.
p50
aa(lp51
VIn one famous example from decades ago,
p52
aVthe management of Vanity Fair magazine
p53
aVactually circulated a memo entitled:
p54
aV"Forbidding Discussion Among Employees of Salary Received."
p55
aV"Forbidding" discussion among employees of salary received.
p56
aVNow that memo didn't sit well with everybody.
p57
aVNew York literary figures Dorothy Parker,
p58
aVRobert Benchley and Robert Sherwood,
p59
aVall writers in the Algonquin Round Table,
p60
aVdecided to stand up for transparency
p61
aVand showed up for work the next day
p62
aVwith their salary written on signs hanging from their neck.
p63
aa(lp64
V(Laughter)
p65
aa(lp66
VImagine showing up for work
p67
aVwith your salary just written across your chest for all to see.
p68
aa(lp69
VBut why would a company even want to discourage salary discussions?
p70
aVWhy do some people go along with it, while others revolt against it?
p71
aVIt turns out that in addition to the assumed reasons,
p72
aVpay secrecy is actually a way to save a lot of money.
p73
aVYou see, keeping salaries secret
p74
aVleads to what economists call "information asymmetry."
p75
aVThis is a situation where, in a negotiation,
p76
aVone party has loads more information than the other.
p77
aVAnd in hiring or promotion or annual raise discussions,
p78
aVan employer can use that secrecy to save a lot of money.
p79
aVImagine how much better you could negotiate for a raise
p80
aVif you knew everybody's salary.
p81
aa(lp82
VEconomists warn that information asymmetry
p83
aVcan cause markets to go awry.
p84
aVSomeone leaves a pay stub on the copier,
p85
aVand suddenly everybody is shouting at each other.
p86
aVIn fact, they even warn
p87
aVthat information asymmetry can lead to a total market failure.
p88
aVAnd I think we're almost there.
p89
aVHere's why:
p90
aVfirst, most employees have no idea how their pay compares to their peers'.
p91
aVIn a 2015 survey of 70,000 employees,
p92
aVtwo-thirds of everyone who is paid at the market rate
p93
aVsaid that they felt they were underpaid.
p94
aVAnd of everybody who felt that they were underpaid,
p95
aV60 percent said that they intended to quit,
p96
aVregardless of where they were \u2014 underpaid, overpaid
p97
aVor right at the market rate.
p98
aVIf you were part of this survey, what would you say?
p99
aVAre you underpaid?
p100
aVWell, wait \u2014 how do you even know,
p101
aVbecause you're not allowed to talk about it?
p102
aa(lp103
VNext, information asymmetry, pay secrecy,
p104
aVmakes it easier to ignore the discrimination
p105
aVthat's already present in the market today.
p106
aVIn a 2011 report from the Institute for Women's Policy Research,
p107
aVthe gender wage gap between men and women
p108
aVwas 23 percent.
p109
aVThis is where that 77 cents on the dollar comes from.
p110
aVBut in the Federal Government,
p111
aVwhere salaries are pinned to certain levels
p112
aVand everybody knows what those levels are,
p113
aVthe gender wage gap shrinks to 11 percent \u2014
p114
aVand this is before controlling for any of the factors
p115
aVthat economists argue over whether or not to control for.
p116
aa(lp117
VIf we really want to close the gender wage gap,
p118
aVmaybe we should start by opening up the payroll.
p119
aVIf this is what total market failure looks like,
p120
aVthen openness remains the only way to ensure fairness.
p121
aa(lp122
VNow, I realize that letting people know what you make
p123
aVmight feel uncomfortable,
p124
aVbut isn't it less uncomfortable
p125
aVthan always wondering if you're being discriminated against,
p126
aVor if your wife or your daughter or your sister is being paid unfairly?
p127
aVOpenness remains the best way to ensure fairness,
p128
aVand pay transparency does that.
p129
aa(lp130
VThat's why entrepreneurial leaders and corporate leaders
p131
aVhave been experimenting with sharing salaries for years.
p132
aVLike Dane Atkinson.
p133
aVDane is a serial entrepreneur who started many companies
p134
aVin a pay secrecy condition
p135
aVand even used that condition to pay two equally qualified people
p136
aVdramatically different salaries,
p137
aVdepending on how well they could negotiate.
p138
aVAnd Dane saw the strife that happened as a result of this.
p139
aVSo when he started his newest company, SumAll,
p140
aVhe committed to salary transparency from the beginning.
p141
aVAnd the results have been amazing.
p142
aVAnd in study after study,
p143
aVwhen people know how they're being paid
p144
aVand how that pay compares to their peers',
p145
aVthey're more likely to work hard to improve their performance,
p146
aVmore likely to be engaged, and they're less likely to quit.
p147
aa(lp148
VThat's why Dane's not alone.
p149
aVFrom technology start-ups like Buffer,
p150
aVto the tens of thousands of employees at Whole Foods,
p151
aVwhere not only is your salary available for everyone to see,
p152
aVbut the performance data for the store and for your department
p153
aVis available on the company intranet
p154
aVfor all to see.
p155
aa(lp156
VNow, pay transparency takes a lot of forms.
p157
aVIt's not one size fits all.
p158
aVSome post their salaries for all to see.
p159
aVSome only keep it inside the company.
p160
aVSome post the formula for calculating pay,
p161
aVand others post the pay levels
p162
aVand affix everybody to that level.
p163
aVSo you don't have to make signs
p164
aVfor all of your employees to wear around the office.
p165
aVAnd you don't have to be the only one wearing a sign
p166
aVthat you made at home.
p167
aVBut we can all take greater steps towards pay transparency.
p168
aVFor those of you that have the authority
p169
aVto move forward towards transparency:
p170
aVit's time to move forward.
p171
aVAnd for those of you that don't have that authority:
p172
aVit's time to stand up for your right to.
p173
aa(lp174
VSo how much do you get paid?
p175
aVAnd how does that compare to the people you work with?
p176
aVYou should know.
p177
aVAnd so should they.
p178
aa(lp179
VThank you.
