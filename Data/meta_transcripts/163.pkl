VImages like this, from the Auschwitz concentration camp,
p4
aVhave been seared into our consciousness during the twentieth century
p5
aVand have given us a new understanding of who we are,
p6
aVwhere we've come from and the times we live in.
p7
aVDuring the twentieth century, we witnessed the atrocities
p8
aVof Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Pol Pot, Rwanda and other genocides,
p9
aVand even though the twenty-first century is only seven years old,
p10
aVwe have already witnessed an ongoing genocide in Darfur
p11
aVand the daily horrors of Iraq.
p12
aVThis has led to a common understanding of our situation,
p13
aVnamely that modernity has brought us terrible violence, and perhaps
p14
aVthat native peoples lived in a state of harmony that we have departed from, to our peril.
p15
aa(lp16
VHere is an example
p17
aVfrom an op-ed on Thanksgiving, in the Boston Globe
p18
aVa couple of years ago, where the writer wrote, "The Indian life
p19
aVwas a difficult one, but there were no employment problems,
p20
aVcommunity harmony was strong, substance abuse unknown,
p21
aVcrime nearly non-existent, what warfare there was between tribes
p22
aVwas largely ritualistic and seldom resulted in indiscriminate
p23
aVor wholesale slaughter." Now, you're all familiar with this treacle.
p24
aVWe teach it to our children. We hear it on television
p25
aVand in storybooks. Now, the original title of this session
p26
aVwas, "Everything You Know Is Wrong," and I'm going to present evidence
p27
aVthat this particular part of our common understanding is wrong,
p28
aVthat, in fact, our ancestors were far more violent than we are,
p29
aVthat violence has been in decline for long stretches of time,
p30
aVand that today we are probably living in the most peaceful time in our species' existence.
p31
aa(lp32
VNow, in the decade of Darfur and Iraq,
p33
aVa statement like that might seem somewhere between hallucinatory
p34
aVand obscene. But I'm going to try to convince you
p35
aVthat that is the correct picture. The decline of violence
p36
aVis a fractal phenomenon. You can see it over millennia,
p37
aVover centuries, over decades and over years,
p38
aValthough there seems to have been a tipping point at the onset
p39
aVof the Age of Reason in the sixteenth century. One sees it
p40
aVall over the world, although not homogeneously.
p41
aVIt's especially evident in the West, beginning with England
p42
aVand Holland around the time of the Enlightenment.
p43
aa(lp44
VLet me take you on a journey of several powers of 10 \u2014
p45
aVfrom the millennium scale to the year scale \u2014
p46
aVto try to persuade you of this. Until 10,000 years ago, all humans
p47
aVlived as hunter-gatherers, without permanent settlements
p48
aVor government. And this is the state that's commonly thought
p49
aVto be one of primordial harmony. But the archaeologist
p50
aVLawrence Keeley, looking at casualty rates
p51
aVamong contemporary hunter-gatherers, which is our best source
p52
aVof evidence about this way of life, has shown a rather different conclusion.
p53
aa(lp54
VHere is a graph that he put together
p55
aVshowing the percentage of male deaths due to warfare
p56
aVin a number of foraging, or hunting and gathering societies.
p57
aVThe red bars correspond to the likelihood that a man will die
p58
aVat the hands of another man, as opposed to passing away
p59
aVof natural causes, in a variety of foraging societies
p60
aVin the New Guinea Highlands and the Amazon Rainforest.
p61
aVAnd they range from a rate of almost a 60 percent chance that a man will die
p62
aVat the hands of another man to, in the case of the Gebusi,
p63
aVonly a 15 percent chance. The tiny, little blue bar in the lower
p64
aVleft-hand corner plots the corresponding statistic from United States
p65
aVand Europe in the twentieth century, and includes all the deaths
p66
aVof both World Wars. If the death rate in tribal warfare had prevailed
p67
aVduring the 20th century, there would have been two billion deaths rather than 100 million.
p68
aa(lp69
VAlso at the millennium scale, we can look
p70
aVat the way of life of early civilizations such as the ones described
p71
aVin the Bible. And in this supposed source of our moral values,
p72
aVone can read descriptions of what was expected in warfare,
p73
aVsuch as the following from Numbers 31: "And they warred
p74
aVagainst the Midianites as the Lord commanded Moses,
p75
aVand they slew all the males. And Moses said unto them,
p76
aV'Have you saved all the women alive? Now, therefore, kill every male
p77
aVamong the little ones and kill every woman that hath known man
p78
aVby lying with him, but all the women children that have not know a man
p79
aVby lying with him keep alive for yourselves.'" In other words,
p80
aVkill the men; kill the children; if you see any virgins,
p81
aVthen you can keep them alive so that you can rape them.
p82
aVYou can find four or five passages in the Bible of this ilk.
p83
aVAlso in the Bible, one sees that the death penalty
p84
aVwas the accepted punishment for crimes such as homosexuality,
p85
aVadultery, blasphemy, idolatry, talking back to your parents \u2014
p86
aV(Laughter) \u2014 and picking up sticks on the Sabbath.
p87
aVWell, let's click the zoom lens
p88
aVdown one order of magnitude, and look at the century scale.
p89
aVAlthough we don't have statistics for warfare throughout
p90
aVthe Middle Ages to modern times,
p91
aVwe know just from conventional history \u2014 the evidence
p92
aVwas under our nose all along that there has been a reduction
p93
aVin socially sanctioned forms of violence.
p94
aa(lp95
VFor example, any social history will reveal that mutilation and torture
p96
aVwere routine forms of criminal punishment. The kind of infraction
p97
aVtoday that would give you a fine, in those days would result in
p98
aVyour tongue being cut out, your ears being cut off, you being blinded,
p99
aVa hand being chopped off and so on.
p100
aVThere were numerous ingenious forms of sadistic capital punishment:
p101
aVburning at the stake, disemboweling, breaking on the wheel,
p102
aVbeing pulled apart by horses and so on.
p103
aVThe death penalty was a sanction for a long list of non-violent crimes:
p104
aVcriticizing the king, stealing a loaf of bread. Slavery, of course,
p105
aVwas the preferred labor-saving device, and cruelty was
p106
aVa popular form of entertainment. Perhaps the most vivid example
p107
aVwas the practice of cat burning, in which a cat was hoisted
p108
aVon a stage and lowered in a sling into a fire,
p109
aVand the spectators shrieked in laughter as the cat, howling in pain,
p110
aVwas burned to death.
p111
aa(lp112
VWhat about one-on-one murder? Well, there, there are good statistics,
p113
aVbecause many municipalities recorded the cause of death.
p114
aVThe criminologist Manuel Eisner
p115
aVscoured all of the historical records across Europe
p116
aVfor homicide rates in any village, hamlet, town, county
p117
aVthat he could find, and he supplemented them
p118
aVwith national data, when nations started keeping statistics.
p119
aVHe plotted on a logarithmic scale, going from 100 deaths
p120
aVper 100,000 people per year, which was approximately the rate
p121
aVof homicide in the Middle Ages. And the figure plummets down
p122
aVto less than one homicide per 100,000 people per year
p123
aVin seven or eight European countries. Then, there is a slight uptick
p124
aVin the 1960s. The people who said that rock 'n' roll would lead
p125
aVto the decline of moral values actually had a grain of truth to that.
p126
aVBut there was a decline from at least two orders of magnitude
p127
aVin homicide from the Middle Ages to the present,
p128
aVand the elbow occurred in the early sixteenth century.
p129
aa(lp130
VLet's click down now to the decade scale.
p131
aVAccording to non-governmental organizations
p132
aVthat keep such statistics, since 1945, in Europe and the Americas,
p133
aVthere has been a steep decline in interstate wars,
p134
aVin deadly ethnic riots or pogroms, and in military coups,
p135
aVeven in South America. Worldwide, there's been a steep decline
p136
aVin deaths in interstate wars. The yellow bars here show the number
p137
aVof deaths per war per year from 1950 to the present.
p138
aVAnd, as you can see, the death rate goes down from 65,000 deaths
p139
aVper conflict per year in the 1950s to less than 2,000 deaths
p140
aVper conflict per year in this decade, as horrific as it is.
p141
aVEven in the year scale, one can see a decline of violence.
p142
aVSince the end of the Cold War, there have been fewer civil wars,
p143
aVfewer genocides \u2014 indeed, a 90 percent reduction since post-World War II highs \u2014
p144
aVand even a reversal of the 1960s uptick in homicide and violent crime.
p145
aVThis is from the FBI Uniform Crime Statistics. You can see
p146
aVthat there is a fairly low rate of violence in the '50s and the '60s,
p147
aVthen it soared upward for several decades, and began
p148
aVa precipitous decline, starting in the 1990s, so that it went back
p149
aVto the level that was last enjoyed in 1960.
p150
aVPresident Clinton, if you're here, thank you.
p151
aV(Laughter)
p152
aa(lp153
VSo the question is, why are so many people so wrong
p154
aVabout something so important? I think there are a number of reasons.
p155
aVOne of them is we have better reporting. The Associated Press
p156
aVis a better chronicler of wars over the surface of the Earth
p157
aVthan sixteenth-century monks were.
p158
aVThere's a cognitive illusion. We cognitive psychologists know that the easier it is
p159
aVto recall specific instances of something,
p160
aVthe higher the probability that you assign to it.
p161
aVThings that we read about in the paper with gory footage
p162
aVburn into memory more than reports of a lot more people dying
p163
aVin their beds of old age. There are dynamics in the opinion
p164
aVand advocacy markets: no one ever attracted observers, advocates
p165
aVand donors by saying
p166
aVthings just seem to be getting better and better.
p167
aV(Laughter)
p168
aa(lp169
VThere's guilt about our treatment of native peoples
p170
aVin modern intellectual life, and an unwillingness to acknowledge
p171
aVthere could be anything good about Western culture.
p172
aVAnd of course, our change in standards can outpace the change
p173
aVin behavior. One of the reasons violence went down
p174
aVis that people got sick of the carnage and cruelty in their time.
p175
aVThat's a process that seems to be continuing,
p176
aVbut if it outstrips behavior by the standards of the day,
p177
aVthings always look more barbaric than they would have been
p178
aVby historic standards. So today, we get exercised \u2014 and rightly so \u2014
p179
aVif a handful of murderers get executed by lethal injection
p180
aVin Texas after a 15-year appeal process. We don't consider
p181
aVthat a couple of hundred years ago, they may have been burned
p182
aVat the stake for criticizing the king after a trial
p183
aVthat lasted 10 minutes, and indeed, that that would have been repeated
p184
aVover and over again. Today, we look at capital punishment
p185
aVas evidence of how low our behavior can sink,
p186
aVrather than how high our standards have risen.
p187
aa(lp188
VWell, why has violence declined? No one really knows,
p189
aVbut I have read four explanations, all of which, I think,
p190
aVhave some grain of plausibility. The first is, maybe
p191
aVThomas Hobbes got it right. He was the one who said
p192
aVthat life in a state of nature was "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish
p193
aVand short." Not because, he argued,
p194
aVhumans have some primordial thirst for blood
p195
aVor aggressive instinct or territorial imperative,
p196
aVbut because of the logic of anarchy. In a state of anarchy,
p197
aVthere's a constant temptation to invade your neighbors preemptively,
p198
aVbefore they invade you. More recently, Thomas Schelling
p199
aVgives the analogy of a homeowner who hears a rustling
p200
aVin the basement. Being a good American, he has a pistol
p201
aVin the nightstand, pulls out his gun, and walks down the stairs.
p202
aVAnd what does he see but a burglar with a gun in his hand.
p203
aVNow, each one of them is thinking,
p204
aV"I don't really want to kill that guy, but he's about to kill me.
p205
aVMaybe I had better shoot him, before he shoots me,
p206
aVespecially since, even if he doesn't want to kill me,
p207
aVhe's probably worrying right now that I might kill him
p208
aVbefore he kills me." And so on.
p209
aVHunter-gatherer peoples explicitly go through this train of thought,
p210
aVand will often raid their neighbors out of fear of being raided first.
p211
aa(lp212
VNow, one way of dealing with this problem is by deterrence.
p213
aVYou don't strike first, but you have a publicly announced policy
p214
aVthat you will retaliate savagely if you are invaded.
p215
aVThe only thing is that it's
p216
aVliable to having its bluff called, and therefore can only work
p217
aVif it's credible. To make it credible, you must avenge all insults
p218
aVand settle all scores, which leads to the cycles of bloody vendetta.
p219
aVLife becomes an episode of "The Sopranos." Hobbes' solution,
p220
aVthe "Leviathan," was that if authority for the legitimate use
p221
aVof violence was vested in a single democratic agency \u2014 a leviathan \u2014
p222
aVthen such a state can reduce the temptation of attack,
p223
aVbecause any kind of aggression will be punished,
p224
aVleaving its profitability as zero. That would remove the temptation
p225
aVto invade preemptively, out of fear of them attacking you first.
p226
aVIt removes the need for a hair trigger for retaliation
p227
aVto make your deterrent threat credible. And therefore, it would lead
p228
aVto a state of peace. Eisner \u2014 the man who plotted the homicide rates
p229
aVthat you failed to see in the earlier slide \u2014
p230
aVargued that the timing of the decline of homicide in Europe
p231
aVcoincided with the rise of centralized states.
p232
aVSo that's a bit of a support for the leviathan theory.
p233
aVAlso supporting it is the fact that we today see eruptions of violence
p234
aVin zones of anarchy, in failed states, collapsed empires,
p235
aVfrontier regions, mafias, street gangs and so on.
p236
aa(lp237
VThe second explanation is that in many times and places,
p238
aVthere is a widespread sentiment that life is cheap.
p239
aVIn earlier times, when suffering and early death were common
p240
aVin one's own life, one has fewer compunctions about inflicting them
p241
aVon others. And as technology and economic efficiency make life
p242
aVlonger and more pleasant, one puts a higher value on life in general.
p243
aVThis was an argument from the political scientist James Payne.
p244
aa(lp245
VA third explanation invokes the concept of a nonzero-sum game,
p246
aVand was worked out in the book "Nonzero" by the journalist
p247
aVRobert Wright. Wright points out that in certain circumstances,
p248
aVcooperation or non-violence can benefit both parties
p249
aVin an interaction, such as gains in trade when two parties trade
p250
aVtheir surpluses and both come out ahead, or when two parties
p251
aVlay down their arms and split the so-called peace dividend
p252
aVthat results in them not having to fight the whole time.
p253
aVWright argues that technology has increased the number
p254
aVof positive-sum games that humans tend to be embroiled in,
p255
aVby allowing the trade of goods, services and ideas
p256
aVover longer distances and among larger groups of people.
p257
aVThe result is that other people become more valuable alive than dead,
p258
aVand violence declines for selfish reasons. As Wright put it,
p259
aV"Among the many reasons that I think that we should not bomb
p260
aVthe Japanese is that they built my mini-van."
p261
aV(Laughter)
p262
aa(lp263
VThe fourth explanation is captured in the title of a book
p264
aVcalled "The Expanding Circle," by the philosopher Peter Singer,
p265
aVwho argues that evolution bequeathed humans with a sense
p266
aVof empathy, an ability to treat other peoples' interests
p267
aVas comparable to one's own. Unfortunately, by default
p268
aVwe apply it only to a very narrow circle of friends and family.
p269
aVPeople outside that circle are treated as sub-human,
p270
aVand can be exploited with impunity. But, over history,
p271
aVthe circle has expanded. One can see, in historical record,
p272
aVit expanding from the village, to the clan, to the tribe,
p273
aVto the nation, to other races, to both sexes,
p274
aVand, in Singer's own arguments, something that we should extend
p275
aVto other sentient species. The question is,
p276
aVif this has happened, what has powered that expansion?
p277
aa(lp278
VAnd there are a number of possibilities, such as increasing circles
p279
aVof reciprocity in the sense that Robert Wright argues for.
p280
aVThe logic of the golden rule \u2014 the more you think about and interact
p281
aVwith other people, the more you realize that it is untenable
p282
aVto privilege your interests over theirs,
p283
aVat least not if you want them to listen to you. You can't say
p284
aVthat my interests are special compared to yours,
p285
aVanymore than you can say that the particular spot
p286
aVthat I'm standing on is a unique part of the universe
p287
aVbecause I happen to be standing on it that very minute.
p288
aVIt may also be powered by cosmopolitanism, by histories,
p289
aVand journalism, and memoirs, and realistic fiction, and travel,
p290
aVand literacy, which allows you to project yourself into the lives
p291
aVof other people that formerly you may have treated as sub-human,
p292
aVand also to realize the accidental contingency of your own station
p293
aVin life, the sense that "there but for fortune go I."
p294
aa(lp295
VWhatever its causes, the decline of violence, I think,
p296
aVhas profound implications. It should force us to ask not just, why
p297
aVis there war? But also, why is there peace? Not just,
p298
aVwhat are we doing wrong? But also, what have we been doing right?
p299
aVBecause we have been doing something right,
p300
aVand it sure would be good to find out what it is.
p301
aVThank you very much.
p302
aV(Applause).
p303
aa(lp304
VChris Anderson: I loved that talk. I think a lot of people here in the room would say
p305
aVthat that expansion of \u2014 that you were talking about,
p306
aVthat Peter Singer talks about, is also driven by, just by technology,
p307
aVby greater visibility of the other, and the sense that the world
p308
aVis therefore getting smaller. I mean, is that also a grain of truth?
p309
aa(lp310
VSteven Pinker: Very much. It would fit both in Wright's theory,
p311
aVthat it allows us to enjoy the benefits of cooperation
p312
aVover larger and larger circles. But also, I think it helps us
p313
aVimagine what it's like to be someone else. I think when you read
p314
aVthese horrific tortures that were common in the Middle Ages, you think,
p315
aVhow could they possibly have done it,
p316
aVhow could they have not have empathized with the person
p317
aVthat they're disemboweling? But clearly,
p318
aVas far as they're concerned, this is just an alien being
p319
aVthat does not have feelings akin to their own. Anything, I think,
p320
aVthat makes it easier to imagine trading places
p321
aVwith someone else means that it increases your moral consideration
p322
aVto that other person.
p323
aa(lp324
VCA: Well, Steve, I would love every news media owner to hear that talk
p325
aVat some point in the next year. I think it's really important. Thank you so much.
