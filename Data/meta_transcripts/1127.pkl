VI'm very fortunate to be here.
p4
aVI feel so fortunate.
p5
aVI've been so impressed by the kindness expressed to me.
p6
aVI called my wife Leslie,
p7
aVand I said, "You know, there's so many good people
p8
aVtrying to do so much good.
p9
aVIt feels like I've landed in a colony of angels."
p10
aVIt's a true feeling.
p11
aVBut let me get to the talk \u2014 I see the clock is running.
p12
aa(lp13
VI'm a public school teacher,
p14
aVand I just want to share a story of my superintendent.
p15
aVHer name is Pam Moran
p16
aVin Albemarle County, Virginia,
p17
aVthe foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains.
p18
aVAnd she's a very high-tech superintendent.
p19
aVShe uses smart boards, she blogs,
p20
aVshe Tweets, she does Facebook,
p21
aVshe does all this sort of high-tech stuff.
p22
aVShe's a technology leader and instructional leader.
p23
aVBut in her office,
p24
aVthere's this old wooden, weather-worn table, kitchen table \u2014
p25
aVpeeling green paint, it's kind of rickety.
p26
aVAnd I said, "Pam, you're such a modern, cutting-edge person.
p27
aVWhy is this old table in your office?"
p28
aa(lp29
VAnd she told me, she said,
p30
aV"You know, I grew up in Southwestern Virginia,
p31
aVin the coal mines and the farmlands of rural Virginia,
p32
aVand this table was in my grandfather's kitchen.
p33
aVAnd we'd come in from playing, he'd come in from plowing and working,
p34
aVand we'd sit around that table every night.
p35
aVAnd as I grew up, I heard so much knowledge
p36
aVand so many insights and so much wisdom
p37
aVcome out around this table,
p38
aVI began to call it the wisdom table.
p39
aVAnd when he passed on, I took this table with me and brought it to my office,
p40
aVand it reminds me of him.
p41
aVIt reminds me of what goes on around an empty space sometimes."
p42
aVThe project I'm going to tell you about
p43
aVis called the World Peace Game,
p44
aVand essentially it is also an empty space.
p45
aVAnd I'd like to think of it
p46
aVas a 21st century wisdom table, really.
p47
aa(lp48
VIt all started back in 1977.
p49
aVI was a young man,
p50
aVand I had been dropping in and out of college.
p51
aVAnd my parents were very patient,
p52
aVbut I had been doing intermittent sojourns to India
p53
aVon a mystical quest.
p54
aVAnd I remember the last time I came back from India \u2014
p55
aVin my long white flowing robes
p56
aVand my big beard and my John Lennon glasses \u2014
p57
aVand I said to my father,
p58
aV"Dad, I think I've just about found spiritual enlightenment."
p59
aVHe said, "Well there's one more thing you need to find."
p60
aVI said, "What is that, dad?" "A job."
p61
aV(Laughter)
p62
aVAnd so they pleaded with me to get a degree in something.
p63
aVSo I got a degree
p64
aVand it turned out to be education.
p65
aVIt was an experimental education program.
p66
aVIt could have been dentistry, but the word "experimental" was in it,
p67
aVand so that's what I had to go for.
p68
aa(lp69
VAnd I went in for a job interview
p70
aVin the Richmond Public Schools in Virginia, the capital city,
p71
aVbought a three-piece suit \u2014 my concession to convention \u2014
p72
aVkept my long beard and my afro
p73
aVand my platform shoes \u2014 at the time it was the '70s \u2014
p74
aVand I walked in, and I sat down and had an interview.
p75
aVAnd I guess they were hard up for teachers
p76
aVbecause the supervisor, her name was Anna Aro,
p77
aVsaid I had the job teaching gifted children.
p78
aVAnd I was so shocked, so stunned,
p79
aVI got up and said, "Well, thank you, but what do I do?"
p80
aV(Laughter)
p81
aVGifted education hadn't really taken hold too much.
p82
aVThere weren't really many materials or things to use.
p83
aVAnd I said, "What do I do?"
p84
aVAnd her answer shocked me. It stunned me.
p85
aVHer answer set the template
p86
aVfor the entire career I was to have after that.
p87
aVShe said, "What do you want to do?"
p88
aVAnd that question cleared the space.
p89
aVThere was no program directive, no manual to follow,
p90
aVno standards in gifted education
p91
aVin that way.
p92
aVAnd she cleared such a space
p93
aVthat I endeavored from then on
p94
aVto clear a space for my students, an empty space,
p95
aVwhereby they could create and make meaning
p96
aVout of their own understanding.
p97
aa(lp98
VSo this happened in 1978,
p99
aVand I was teaching many years later,
p100
aVand a friend of mine introduced me to a young filmmaker.
p101
aVHis name is Chris Farina.
p102
aVChris Farina is here today at his own cost.
p103
aVChris, could you stand up and let them see you \u2014
p104
aVa young, visionary filmmaker who's made a film.
p105
aV(Applause)
p106
aVThis film is called "World Peace and Other 4th Grade Achievements."
p107
aVHe proposed the film to me \u2014 it's a great title.
p108
aVHe proposed the film to me,
p109
aVand I said, "Yeah, maybe it'll be on local TV,
p110
aVand we can say hi to our friends."
p111
aVBut the film has really gone places.
p112
aVNow it's still in debt, but Chris has managed, through his own sacrifice,
p113
aVto get this film out.
p114
aVSo we made a film
p115
aVand it turns out to be more than a story about me,
p116
aVmore than a story about one teacher.
p117
aVIt's a story that's a testament to teaching and teachers.
p118
aVAnd it's a beautiful thing.
p119
aa(lp120
VAnd the strange thing is, when I watch the film \u2014
p121
aVI have the eerie sensation of seeing it \u2014
p122
aVI saw myself literally disappear.
p123
aVWhat I saw
p124
aVwas my teachers coming through me.
p125
aVI saw my geometry teacher in high school, Mr. Rucell's
p126
aVwry smile under his handlebar mustache.
p127
aVThat's the smile I use \u2014 that's his smile.
p128
aVI saw Jan Polo's flashing eyes.
p129
aVAnd they weren't flashing in anger,
p130
aVthey were flashing in love, intense love for her students.
p131
aVAnd I have that kind of flash sometimes.
p132
aVAnd I saw Miss Ethel J. Banks
p133
aVwho wore pearls and high-heels to elementary school every day.
p134
aVAnd you know, she had that old-school teacher stare.
p135
aVYou know the one.
p136
aV(Laughter)
p137
aV"And I'm not even talking about you behind me,
p138
aVbecause I've got eyes in the back of my head."
p139
aV(Laughter)
p140
aVYou know that teacher?
p141
aVI didn't use that stare very often,
p142
aVbut I do have it in my repertoire.
p143
aVAnd Miss Banks was there as a great mentor for me.
p144
aa(lp145
VAnd then I saw
p146
aVmy own parents, my first teachers.
p147
aVMy father, very inventive, spatial thinker.
p148
aVThat's my brother Malcolm there on the right.
p149
aVAnd my mother,
p150
aVwho taught me in fourth grade
p151
aVin segregated schools in Virginia,
p152
aVwho was my inspiration.
p153
aVAnd really, I feel as though,
p154
aVwhen I see the film \u2014
p155
aVI have a gesture she does, like this \u2014
p156
aVI feel like I am a continuation of her gesture.
p157
aVI am one of her teaching gestures.
p158
aVAnd the beautiful thing was,
p159
aVI got to teach my daughter in elementary school, Madeline.
p160
aVAnd so that gesture of my mother's
p161
aVcontinues through many generations.
p162
aVIt's an amazing feeling
p163
aVto have that lineage.
p164
aVAnd so I'm here standing on the shoulders of many people.
p165
aVI'm not here alone.
p166
aVThere are many people on this stage right now.
p167
aa(lp168
VAnd so this World Peace Game I'd like to tell you about.
p169
aVIt started out like this:
p170
aVit's just a four-foot by five-foot plywood board
p171
aVin an inner-city urban school, 1978.
p172
aVI was creating a lesson for students on Africa.
p173
aVWe put all the problems of the world there,
p174
aVand I thought, let's let them solve it.
p175
aVI didn't want to lecture or have just book reading.
p176
aVI wanted to have them be immersed
p177
aVand learn the feeling of learning through their bodies.
p178
aVSo I thought, well they like to play games.
p179
aVI'll make something \u2014 I didn't say interactive;
p180
aVwe didn't have that term in 1978 \u2014
p181
aVbut something interactive.
p182
aVAnd so we made the game,
p183
aVand it has since evolved
p184
aVto a four-foot by four-foot by four-foot
p185
aVPlexiglass structure.
p186
aVAnd it has four Plexiglass layers.
p187
aa(lp188
VThere's an outer space layer
p189
aVwith black holes and satellites
p190
aVand research satellites and asteroid mining.
p191
aVThere's an air and space level
p192
aVwith clouds that are big puffs of cotton we push around
p193
aVand territorial air spaces and air forces,
p194
aVa ground and sea level with thousands of game pieces on it \u2014
p195
aVeven an undersea level
p196
aVwith submarines and undersea mining.
p197
aVThere are four countries around the board.
p198
aVThe kids make up the names of the countries \u2014 some are rich; some are poor.
p199
aVThey have different assets, commercial and military.
p200
aVAnd each country has a cabinet.
p201
aVThere's a Prime Minister, Secretary of State, Minister of Defense
p202
aVand a CFO, or Comptroller.
p203
aVI choose the Prime Minister based on my relationship with them.
p204
aVI offer them the job, they can turn it down,
p205
aVand then they choose their own cabinet.
p206
aVThere's a World Bank, arms dealers and a United Nations.
p207
aVThere's also a weather goddess
p208
aVwho controls a random stock market and random weather.
p209
aa(lp210
V(Laughter)
p211
aa(lp212
VThat's not all.
p213
aVAnd then there's a 13-page crisis document
p214
aVwith 50 interlocking problems.
p215
aVSo that, if one thing changes, everything else changes.
p216
aVI throw them into this complex matrix,
p217
aVand they trust me because we have a deep, rich relationship together.
p218
aVAnd so with all these crises,
p219
aVwe have \u2014 let's see \u2014 ethnic and minority tensions;
p220
aVwe have chemical and nuclear spills,
p221
aVnuclear proliferation.
p222
aVThere's oil spills, environmental disasters,
p223
aVwater rights disputes, breakaway republics,
p224
aVfamine, endangered species and global warming.
p225
aVIf Al Gore is here,
p226
aVI'm going to send my fourth-graders from Agnor-Hurt and Venable schools to you
p227
aVbecause they solved global warming in a week.
p228
aV(Laughter)
p229
aV(Applause)
p230
aVAnd they've done it several times too.
p231
aa(lp232
V(Laughter)
p233
aa(lp234
VSo I also have in the game a saboteur \u2014
p235
aVsome child \u2014 it's basically a troublemaker \u2014
p236
aVand I have my troublemaker put to use
p237
aVbecause they, on the surface,
p238
aVare trying to save the world and their position in the game.
p239
aVBut they're also trying to undermine everything in the game.
p240
aVAnd they do it secretly through misinformation
p241
aVand ambiguities and irrelevancies,
p242
aVtrying to cause everyone to think more deeply.
p243
aVThe saboteur is there,
p244
aVand we also read from Sun Tzu's "The Art of War."
p245
aVFourth-graders understand it \u2014 nine years old \u2014
p246
aVand they handle that and use that
p247
aVto understand how to, not follow \u2014
p248
aVat first they do \u2014
p249
aVthe paths to power and destruction,
p250
aVthe path to war.
p251
aVThey learn to overlook short-sighted reactions
p252
aVand impulsive thinking,
p253
aVto think in a long-term, more consequential way.
p254
aa(lp255
VStewart Brand is here, and one of the ideas for this game came from him
p256
aVwith a CoEvolution Quarterly article
p257
aVon a peace force.
p258
aVAnd in the game, sometimes students actually form a peace force.
p259
aVI'm just a clock watcher.
p260
aVI'm just a clarifier. I'm just a facilitator.
p261
aVThe students run the game.
p262
aVI have no chance to make any policy whatsoever
p263
aVonce they start playing.
p264
aVSo I'll just share with you ...
p265
aa(lp266
V(Video) Boy: The World Peace Game is serious.
p267
aVYou're actually getting taught something like how to take care of the world.
p268
aVSee, Mr. Hunter is doing that
p269
aVbecause he says his time has messed up a lot,
p270
aVand he's trying to tell us
p271
aVhow to fix that problem.
p272
aa(lp273
VJohn Hunter: I offered them a \u2014
p274
aV(Applause)
p275
aVActually, I can't tell them anything because I don't know the answer.
p276
aVAnd I admit the truth to them right up front: I don't know.
p277
aVAnd because I don't know, they've got to dig up the answer.
p278
aVAnd so I apologize to them as well.
p279
aVI say, "I'm so sorry, boys and girls,
p280
aVbut the truth is
p281
aVwe have left this world to you in such a sad and terrible shape,
p282
aVand we hope you can fix it for us,
p283
aVand maybe this game will help you learn how to do it."
p284
aVIt's a sincere apology,
p285
aVand they take it very seriously.
p286
aa(lp287
VNow you may be wondering what all this complexity looks like.
p288
aVWell when we have the game start, here's what you see.
p289
aa(lp290
V(Video) JH: All right, we're going into negotiations as of now. Go.
p291
aV(Chatter)
p292
aa(lp293
VJH: My question to you is, who's in charge of that classroom?
p294
aVIt's a serious question: who is really in charge?
p295
aVI've learned to cede control of the classroom
p296
aVover to the students over time.
p297
aVThere's a trust and an understanding
p298
aVand a dedication to an ideal
p299
aVthat I simply don't have to do
p300
aVwhat I thought I had to do as a beginning teacher:
p301
aVcontrol every conversation and response in the classroom.
p302
aVIt's impossible. Their collective wisdom
p303
aVis much greater than mine,
p304
aVand I admit it to them openly.
p305
aVSo I'll just share with you some stories very quickly
p306
aVof some magical things that have happened.
p307
aa(lp308
VIn this game we had a little girl,
p309
aVand she was the Defense Minister of the poorest nation.
p310
aVAnd the Defense Minister \u2014 she had the tank corps and Air Force and so forth.
p311
aVAnd she was next door to a very wealthy, oil-rich neighbor.
p312
aVWithout provocation,
p313
aVsuddenly she attacked, against her Prime Minister's orders,
p314
aVthe next-door neighbor's oil fields.
p315
aVShe marched into the oil field reserves,
p316
aVsurrounded it, without firing a shot,
p317
aVand secured it and held it.
p318
aVAnd that neighbor was unable to conduct any military operations
p319
aVbecause their fuel supply was locked up.
p320
aa(lp321
VWe were all upset with her, "Why are you doing this?
p322
aVThis is the World Peace Game. What is wrong with you?"
p323
aV(Laughter)
p324
aVThis was a little girl and, at nine years old,
p325
aVshe held her pieces and said, "I know what I'm doing."
p326
aVTo her girlfriends she said that.
p327
aVThat's a breach there.
p328
aVAnd we learned in this, you don't really ever want to cross
p329
aVa nine year-old girl with tanks.
p330
aV(Laughter)
p331
aVThey are the toughest opponents.
p332
aVAnd we were very upset.
p333
aVI thought I was failing as a teacher. Why would she do this?
p334
aa(lp335
VBut come to find out, a few game days later \u2014
p336
aVand there are turns where we take negotiation from a team \u2014
p337
aVactually there's a negotiation period with all teams,
p338
aVand each team takes a turn,
p339
aVthen we go back in negotiation, around and around,
p340
aVso each turn around is one game day.
p341
aVSo a few game days later it came to light
p342
aVthat we found out this major country
p343
aVwas planning a military offensive
p344
aVto dominate the entire world.
p345
aVHad they had their fuel supplies, they would have done it.
p346
aVShe was able to see the vectors and trend lines and intentions
p347
aVlong before any of us
p348
aVand understand what was going to happen
p349
aVand made a philosophical decision
p350
aVto attack in a peace game.
p351
aa(lp352
VNow she used a small war to avert a larger war,
p353
aVso we stopped and had a very good philosophical discussion
p354
aVabout whether that was right,
p355
aVconditional good, or not right.
p356
aVThat's the kind of thinking that we put them in, the situations.
p357
aVI could not have designed that in teaching it.
p358
aVIt came about spontaneously through their collective wisdom.
p359
aa(lp360
V(Applause)
p361
aa(lp362
VAnother example, a beautiful thing happened.
p363
aVWe have a letter in the game.
p364
aVIf you're a military commander and you wage troops \u2014
p365
aVthe little plastic toys on the board \u2014 and you lose them,
p366
aVI put in a letter.
p367
aVYou have to write a letter to their parents \u2014
p368
aVthe fictional parents of your fictional troops \u2014
p369
aVexplaining what happened and offering your condolences.
p370
aVSo you have a little bit more thought
p371
aVbefore you commit to combat.
p372
aVAnd so we had this situation come up \u2014
p373
aVlast summer actually,
p374
aVat Agnor-Hurt School in Albemarle County \u2014
p375
aVand one of our military commanders got up to read that letter
p376
aVand one of the other kids said, "Mr. Hunter,
p377
aVlet's ask \u2014 there's a parent over there."
p378
aVThere was a parent visiting that day, just sitting in the back of the room.
p379
aV"Let's ask that mom to read the letter.
p380
aVIt'll be more realer if she reads it."
p381
aVSo we did, we asked her, and she gamely picked up the letter.
p382
aV"Sure." She started reading. She read one sentence.
p383
aVShe read two sentences.
p384
aVBy the third sentence, she was in tears.
p385
aVI was in tears.
p386
aVEverybody understood
p387
aVthat when we lose somebody, the winners are not gloating.
p388
aVWe all lose.
p389
aVAnd it was an amazing occurrence and an amazing understanding.
p390
aa(lp391
VI'll show you what my friend David says about this.
p392
aVHe's been in many battles.
p393
aa(lp394
V(Video) David: We've really had enough of people attacking.
p395
aVI mean, we've been lucky [most of] the time.
p396
aVBut now I'm feeling really weird
p397
aVbecause I'm living what Sun Tzu said one week.
p398
aVOne week he said,
p399
aV"Those who go into battle and win
p400
aVwill want to go back,
p401
aVand those who lose in battle
p402
aVwill want to go back and win."
p403
aVAnd so I've been winning battles,
p404
aVso I'm going into battles, more battles.
p405
aVAnd I think it's sort of weird to be living
p406
aVwhat Sun Tzu said.
p407
aa(lp408
VJH: I get chills every time I see that.
p409
aVThat's the kind of engagement you want to have happen.
p410
aVAnd I can't design that, I can't plan that,
p411
aVand I can't even test that.
p412
aVBut it's self-evident assessment.
p413
aVWe know that's an authentic assessment of learning.
p414
aVWe have a lot of data, but I think sometimes we go beyond data
p415
aVwith the real truth of what's going on.
p416
aa(lp417
VSo I'll just share a third story.
p418
aVThis is about my friend Brennan.
p419
aVWe had played the game one session after school
p420
aVfor many weeks, about seven weeks,
p421
aVand we had essentially solved all 50 of the interlocking crises.
p422
aVThe way the game is won is all 50 problems have to be solved
p423
aVand every country's asset value
p424
aVhas to be increased above its starting point.
p425
aVSome are poor, some are wealthy. There are billions.
p426
aVThe World Bank president was a third-grader one time.
p427
aVHe says, "How many zeros in a trillion? I've got to calculate that right away."
p428
aVBut he was setting fiscal policy in that game
p429
aVfor high school players who were playing with him.
p430
aa(lp431
VSo the team that was the poorest
p432
aVhad gotten even poorer.
p433
aVThere was no way they could win.
p434
aVAnd we were approaching four o'clock, our cut-off time \u2014
p435
aVthere was about a minute left \u2014
p436
aVand despair just settled over the room.
p437
aVI thought, I'm failing as a teacher.
p438
aVI should have gotten it so they could have won.
p439
aVThey shouldn't be failing like this.
p440
aVI've failed them.
p441
aVAnd I was just feeling so sad and dejected.
p442
aVAnd suddenly, Brennan walked over to my chair
p443
aVand he grabbed the bell, the bell I ring
p444
aVto signal a change or a reconvening of cabinets,
p445
aVand he ran back to his seat, rang the bell.
p446
aVEverybody ran to his chair: there was screaming;
p447
aVthere was yelling, waving of their dossiers.
p448
aVThey get these dossiers full of secret documents.
p449
aVThey were gesticulating; they were running around.
p450
aVI didn't know what they were doing. I'd lost control of my classroom.
p451
aVPrincipal walks in, I'm out of a job.
p452
aVThe parents were looking in the window.
p453
aa(lp454
VAnd Brennan runs back to his seat. Everybody runs back to their seat.
p455
aVHe rings the bell again. He says, "We have" \u2014
p456
aVand there's 12 seconds left on the clock \u2014
p457
aV"we have, all nations, pooled all our funds together.
p458
aVAnd we've got 600 billion dollars.
p459
aVWe're going to offer it as a donation to this poor country.
p460
aVAnd if they accept it, it'll raise their asset value and we can win the game.
p461
aVWill you accept it?"
p462
aVAnd there are three seconds left on the clock.
p463
aVEverybody looks at this prime minister of that country,
p464
aVand he says, "Yes."
p465
aVAnd the game is won.
p466
aVSpontaneous compassion
p467
aVthat could not be planned for,
p468
aVthat was unexpected and unpredictable.
p469
aa(lp470
VEvery game we play is different.
p471
aVSome games are more about social issues,
p472
aVsome are more about economic issues.
p473
aVSome games are more about warfare.
p474
aVBut I don't try to deny them that reality of being human.
p475
aVI allow them to go there
p476
aVand, through their own experience, learn, in a bloodless way,
p477
aVhow not to do what they consider to be the wrong thing.
p478
aVAnd they find out what is right
p479
aVtheir own way, their own selves.
p480
aVAnd so in this game,
p481
aVI've learned so much from it,
p482
aVbut I would say
p483
aVthat if only
p484
aVthey could pick up a critical thinking tool
p485
aVor creative thinking tool
p486
aVfrom this game
p487
aVand leverage something good for the world,
p488
aVthey may save us all.
p489
aVIf only.
p490
aa(lp491
VAnd on behalf of all of my teachers
