VThe story starts: I was at a friend's house,
p4
aVand she had on her shelf a copy of the DSM manual,
p5
aVwhich is the manual of mental disorders.
p6
aVIt lists every known mental disorder.
p7
aVAnd it used to be, back in the '50s, a very slim pamphlet.
p8
aVAnd then it got bigger and bigger and bigger,
p9
aVand now it's 886 pages long.
p10
aVAnd it lists currently 374 mental disorders.
p11
aa(lp12
VSo I was leafing through it,
p13
aVwondering if I had any mental disorders,
p14
aVand it turns out I've got 12.
p15
aa(lp16
V(Laughter)
p17
aa(lp18
VI've got generalized anxiety disorder,
p19
aVwhich is a given.
p20
aVI've got nightmare disorder,
p21
aVwhich is categorized
p22
aVif you have recurrent dreams of being pursued or declared a failure,
p23
aVand all my dreams involve people chasing me down the street
p24
aVgoing, "You're a failure!"
p25
aa(lp26
V(Laughter)
p27
aa(lp28
VI've got parent-child relational problems,
p29
aVwhich I blame my parents for.
p30
aa(lp31
V(Laughter)
p32
aa(lp33
VI'm kidding. I'm not kidding.
p34
aVI'm kidding.
p35
aVAnd I've got malingering.
p36
aVAnd I think it's actually quite rare
p37
aVto have both malingering and generalized anxiety disorder,
p38
aVbecause malingering tends to make me feel very anxious.
p39
aa(lp40
VAnyway, I was looking through this book,
p41
aVwondering if I was much crazier than I thought I was,
p42
aVor maybe it's not a good idea to diagnose yourself with a mental disorder
p43
aVif you're not a trained professional,
p44
aVor maybe the psychiatry profession has a kind of strange desire
p45
aVto label what's essentially normal human behavior as a mental disorder.
p46
aVI didn't know which of these was true, but I thought it was kind of interesting,
p47
aVand I thought maybe I should meet a critic of psychiatry
p48
aVto get their view,
p49
aVwhich is how I ended up having lunch with the Scientologists.
p50
aa(lp51
V(Laughter)
p52
aa(lp53
VIt was a man called Brian, who runs a crack team of Scientologists
p54
aVwho are determined to destroy psychiatry wherever it lies.
p55
aVThey're called the CCHR.
p56
aVAnd I said to him, "Can you prove to me
p57
aVthat psychiatry is a pseudo-science that can't be trusted?"
p58
aVAnd he said, "Yes, we can prove it to you."
p59
aVAnd I said, "How?"
p60
aVAnd he said, "We're going to introduce you to Tony."
p61
aVAnd I said, "Who's Tony?"
p62
aVAnd he said, "Tony's in Broadmoor."
p63
aVNow, Broadmoor is Broadmoor Hospital.
p64
aVIt used to be known as the Broadmoor Asylum for the Criminally Insane.
p65
aVIt's where they send the serial killers,
p66
aVand the people who can't help themselves.
p67
aVAnd I said to Brian, "Well, what did Tony do?"
p68
aVAnd he said, "Hardly anything.
p69
aVHe beat someone up or something,
p70
aVand he decided to fake madness to get out of a prison sentence.
p71
aVBut he faked it too well, and now he's stuck in Broadmoor
p72
aVand nobody will believe he's sane.
p73
aVDo you want us to try and get you into Broadmoor to meet Tony?"
p74
aVSo I said, "Yes, please."
p75
aa(lp76
VSo I got the train to Broadmoor.
p77
aVI began to yawn uncontrollably around Kempton Park,
p78
aVwhich apparently is what dogs also do when anxious,
p79
aVthey yawn uncontrollably.
p80
aVAnd we got to Broadmoor.
p81
aVAnd I got taken through gate after gate after gate after gate
p82
aVinto the wellness center, which is where you get to meet the patients.
p83
aVIt looks like a giant Hampton Inn.
p84
aVIt's all peach and pine and calming colors.
p85
aVAnd the only bold colors are the reds of the panic buttons.
p86
aVAnd the patients started drifting in.
p87
aVAnd they were quite overweight and wearing sweatpants,
p88
aVand quite docile-looking.
p89
aVAnd Brian the Scientologist whispered to me,
p90
aV"They're medicated,"
p91
aVwhich, to the Scientologists, is like the worst evil in the world,
p92
aVbut I'm thinking it's probably a good idea.
p93
aa(lp94
V(Laughter)
p95
aa(lp96
VAnd then Brian said, "Here's Tony."
p97
aVAnd a man was walking in.
p98
aVAnd he wasn't overweight, he was in very good physical shape.
p99
aVAnd he wasn't wearing sweatpants,
p100
aVhe was wearing a pinstripe suit.
p101
aVAnd he had his arm outstretched
p102
aVlike someone out of The Apprentice.
p103
aVHe looked like a man who wanted to wear an outfit
p104
aVthat would convince me that he was very sane.
p105
aa(lp106
VAnd he sat down.
p107
aVAnd I said, "So is it true that you faked your way in here?"
p108
aVAnd he said, "Yep. Yep. Absolutely. I beat someone up when I was 17.
p109
aVAnd I was in prison awaiting trial,
p110
aVand my cellmate said to me,
p111
aV'You know what you have to do?
p112
aVFake madness.
p113
aVTell them you're mad, you'll get sent to some cushy hospital.
p114
aVNurses will bring you pizzas, you'll have your own PlayStation.'"
p115
aVI said, "Well, how did you do it?"
p116
aVHe said, "Well, I asked to see the prison psychiatrist.
p117
aVAnd I'd just seen a film called 'Crash,'
p118
aVin which people get sexual pleasure from crashing cars into walls.
p119
aVSo I said to the psychiatrist,
p120
aV'I get sexual pleasure from crashing cars into walls.'"
p121
aVAnd I said, "What else?"
p122
aVHe said, "Oh, yeah. I told the psychiatrist
p123
aVthat I wanted to watch women as they died,
p124
aVbecause it would make me feel more normal."
p125
aVI said, "Where'd you get that from?"
p126
aVHe said, "Oh, from a biography of Ted Bundy that they had
p127
aVat the prison library."
p128
aa(lp129
VAnyway, he faked madness too well, he said.
p130
aVAnd they didn't send him to some cushy hospital.
p131
aVThey sent him to Broadmoor.
p132
aVAnd the minute he got there,
p133
aVsaid he took one look at the place, asked to see the psychiatrist,
p134
aVsaid, "There's been a terrible misunderstanding.
p135
aVI'm not mentally ill."
p136
aVI said, "How long have you been here for?"
p137
aVHe said, "Well, if I'd just done my time in prison
p138
aVfor the original crime, I'd have got five years.
p139
aVI've been in Broadmoor for 12 years."
p140
aa(lp141
VTony said that it's a lot harder to convince people you're sane
p142
aVthan it is to convince them you're crazy.
p143
aVHe said, "I thought the best way to seem normal
p144
aVwould be to talk to people normally about normal things
p145
aVlike football or what's on TV.
p146
aVI subscribe to New Scientist,
p147
aVand recently they had an article
p148
aVabout how the U.S. Army was training bumblebees to sniff out explosives.
p149
aVSo I said to a nurse,
p150
aV'Did you know that the U.S. Army is training bumblebees
p151
aVto sniff out explosives?'
p152
aVWhen I read my medical notes, I saw they'd written:
p153
aV'Believes bees can sniff out explosives.'"
p154
aa(lp155
V(Laughter)
p156
aa(lp157
VHe said, "You know, they're always looking out for nonverbal clues
p158
aVto my mental state.
p159
aVBut how do you sit in a sane way?
p160
aVHow do you cross your legs in a sane way?
p161
aVIt's just impossible."
p162
aVWhen Tony said that to me,
p163
aVI thought to myself, "Am I sitting like a journalist?
p164
aVAm I crossing my legs like a journalist?"
p165
aa(lp166
VHe said, "You know, I've got the Stockwell Strangler on one side of me,
p167
aVand I've got the 'Tiptoe Through the Tulips' rapist
p168
aVon the other side of me.
p169
aVSo I tend to stay in my room a lot because I find them quite frightening.
p170
aVAnd they take that as a sign of madness.
p171
aVThey say it proves that I'm aloof and grandiose."
p172
aVSo, only in Broadmoor would not wanting to hang out with serial killers
p173
aVbe a sign of madness.
p174
aVAnyway, he seemed completely normal to me, but what did I know?
p175
aa(lp176
VAnd when I got home I emailed his clinician, Anthony Maden.
p177
aVI said, "What's the story?"
p178
aVAnd he said, "Yep. We accept that Tony faked madness
p179
aVto get out of a prison sentence, because his hallucinations \u2014
p180
aVthat had seemed quite cliche to begin with \u2014
p181
aVjust vanished the minute he got to Broadmoor.
p182
aVHowever, we have assessed him,
p183
aVand we've determined that what he is
p184
aVis a psychopath."
p185
aVAnd in fact, faking madness
p186
aVis exactly the kind of cunning and manipulative act of a psychopath.
p187
aVIt's on the checklist: cunning, manipulative.
p188
aVSo, faking your brain going wrong
p189
aVis evidence that your brain has gone wrong.
p190
aVAnd I spoke to other experts,
p191
aVand they said the pinstripe suit \u2014 classic psychopath \u2014
p192
aVspeaks to items one and two on the checklist:
p193
aVglibness, superficial charm and grandiose sense of self-worth.
p194
aVAnd I said, "Well, but why didn't he hang out with the other patients?"
p195
aVClassic psychopath \u2014 it speaks to grandiosity and also lack of empathy.
p196
aVSo all the things that had seemed most normal about Tony
p197
aVwas evidence, according to his clinician,
p198
aVthat he was mad in this new way.
p199
aVHe was a psychopath.
p200
aa(lp201
VAnd his clinician said to me, "If you want to know more about psychopaths,
p202
aVyou can go on a psychopath-spotting course
p203
aVrun by Robert Hare, who invented the psychopath checklist."
p204
aVSo I did.
p205
aVI went on a psychopath-spotting course,
p206
aVand I am now a certified \u2014
p207
aVand I have to say, extremely adept \u2014 psychopath spotter.
p208
aa(lp209
VSo, here's the statistics:
p210
aVOne in a hundred regular people is a psychopath.
p211
aVSo there's 1,500 people in his room.
p212
aVFifteen of you are psychopaths.
p213
aVAlthough that figure rises to four percent of CEOs and business leaders,
p214
aVso I think there's a very good chance
p215
aVthere's about 30 or 40 psychopaths in this room.
p216
aVIt could be carnage by the end of the night.
p217
aa(lp218
V(Laughter)
p219
aa(lp220
VHare said the reason why is because capitalism at its most ruthless
p221
aVrewards psychopathic behavior \u2014
p222
aVthe lack of empathy, the glibness,
p223
aVcunning, manipulative.
p224
aVIn fact, capitalism, perhaps at its most remorseless,
p225
aVis a physical manifestation of psychopathy.
p226
aVIt's like a form of psychopathy that's come down to affect us all.
p227
aVHare said, "You know what? Forget about some guy at Broadmoor
p228
aVwho may or may not have faked madness.
p229
aVWho cares? That's not a big story.
p230
aVThe big story," he said, "is corporate psychopathy.
p231
aVYou want to go and interview yourself some corporate psychopaths."
p232
aa(lp233
VSo I gave it a try. I wrote to the Enron people.
p234
aVI said, "Could I come and interview you in prison,
p235
aVto find out it you're psychopaths?"
p236
aa(lp237
V(Laughter)
p238
aa(lp239
VAnd they didn't reply.
p240
aa(lp241
V(Laughter)
p242
aa(lp243
VSo I changed tack.
p244
aVI emailed "Chainsaw Al" Dunlap,
p245
aVthe asset stripper from the 1990s.
p246
aVHe would come into failing businesses
p247
aVand close down 30 percent of the workforce,
p248
aVjust turn American towns into ghost towns.
p249
aVAnd I emailed him and I said,
p250
aV"I believe you may have a very special brain anomaly
p251
aVthat makes you ... special,
p252
aVand interested in the predatory spirit, and fearless.
p253
aVCan I come and interview you about your special brain anomaly?"
p254
aVAnd he said, "Come on over!"
p255
aa(lp256
V(Laughter)
p257
aa(lp258
VSo I went to Al Dunlap's grand Florida mansion.
p259
aVIt was filled with sculptures of predatory animals.
p260
aVThere were lions and tigers \u2014 he was taking me through the garden \u2014
p261
aVthere were falcons and eagles,
p262
aVhe was saying, "Over there you've got sharks and \u2014"
p263
aVhe was saying this in a less effeminate way \u2014
p264
aV"You've got more sharks and you've got tigers."
p265
aVIt was like Narnia.
p266
aa(lp267
V(Laughter)
p268
aa(lp269
VAnd then we went into his kitchen.
p270
aVNow, Al Dunlap would be brought in to save failing companies,
p271
aVhe'd close down 30 percent of the workforce.
p272
aVAnd he'd quite often fire people with a joke.
p273
aVLike, for instance, one famous story about him,
p274
aVsomebody came up to him and said, "I've just bought myself a new car."
p275
aVAnd he said, "Well, you may have a new car,
p276
aVbut I'll tell you what you don't have \u2014 a job."
p277
aa(lp278
VSo in his kitchen \u2014
p279
aVhe was in there with his wife, Judy, and his bodyguard, Sean \u2014
p280
aVand I said, "You know how I said in my email
p281
aVthat you might have a special brain anomaly that makes you special?"
p282
aVHe said, "Yeah, it's an amazing theory, it's like Star Trek.
p283
aVYou're going where no man has gone before."
p284
aVAnd I said, "Well \u2014" (Clears throat)
p285
aa(lp286
V(Laughter)
p287
aa(lp288
VSome psychologists might say
p289
aVthat this makes you \u2014" (Mumbles)
p290
aa(lp291
V(Laughter)
p292
aa(lp293
VAnd he said, "What?"
p294
aVAnd I said, "A psychopath."
p295
aVAnd I said, "I've got a list of psychopathic traits in my pocket.
p296
aVCan I go through them with you?"
p297
aa(lp298
VAnd he looked intrigued despite himself,
p299
aVand he said, "Okay, go on."
p300
aVAnd I said, "Okay. Grandiose sense of self-worth."
p301
aVWhich I have to say, would have been hard for him to deny,
p302
aVbecause he was standing under a giant oil painting of himself.
p303
aa(lp304
V(Laughter)
p305
aa(lp306
VHe said, "Well, you've got to believe in you!"
p307
aVAnd I said, "Manipulative."
p308
aVHe said, "That's leadership."
p309
aa(lp310
V(Laughter)
p311
aa(lp312
VAnd I said, "Shallow affect,
p313
aVan inability to experience a range of emotions."
p314
aVHe said, "Who wants to be weighed down by some nonsense emotions?"
p315
aVSo he was going down the psychopath checklist,
p316
aVbasically turning it into "Who Moved My Cheese?"
p317
aa(lp318
V(Laughter)
p319
aa(lp320
VBut I did notice something happening to me the day I was with Al Dunlap.
p321
aVWhenever he said anything to me that was kind of normal \u2014
p322
aVlike he said "no" to juvenile delinquency,
p323
aVhe said he got accepted into West Point,
p324
aVand they don't let delinquents in West Point.
p325
aVHe said "no" to many short-term marital relationships.
p326
aVHe's only ever been married twice.
p327
aVAdmittedly, his first wife cited in her divorce papers
p328
aVthat he once threatened her with a knife
p329
aVand said he always wondered what human flesh tasted like,
p330
aVbut people say stupid things to each other
p331
aVin bad marriages in the heat of an argument,
p332
aVand his second marriage has lasted 41 years.
p333
aVSo whenever he said anything to me that just seemed kind of non-psychopathic,
p334
aVI thought to myself, well I'm not going to put that in my book.
p335
aVAnd then I realized that becoming a psychopath spotter
p336
aVhad kind of turned me a little bit psychopathic.
p337
aVBecause I was desperate to shove him in a box marked "Psychopath."
p338
aVI was desperate to define him by his maddest edges.
p339
aa(lp340
VAnd I realized, my God \u2014
p341
aVthis is what I've been doing for 20 years.
p342
aVIt's what all journalists do.
p343
aVWe travel across the world with our notepads in our hands,
p344
aVand we wait for the gems.
p345
aVAnd the gems are always the outermost aspects
p346
aVof our interviewee's personality.
p347
aVAnd we stitch them together like medieval monks,
p348
aVand we leave the normal stuff on the floor.
p349
aVAnd you know, this is a country that over-diagnoses
p350
aVcertain mental disorders hugely.
p351
aVChildhood bipolar \u2014
p352
aVchildren as young as four are being labeled bipolar
p353
aVbecause they have temper tantrums,
p354
aVwhich scores them high on the bipolar checklist.
p355
aa(lp356
VWhen I got back to London, Tony phoned me.
p357
aVHe said, "Why haven't you been returning my calls?"
p358
aVI said, "Well, they say that you're a psychopath."
p359
aVAnd he said, "I'm not a psychopath."
p360
aVHe said, "You know what?
p361
aVOne of the items on the checklist is lack of remorse,
p362
aVbut another item on the checklist is cunning, manipulative.
p363
aVSo when you say you feel remorse for your crime,
p364
aVthey say, 'Typical of the psychopath
p365
aVto cunningly say he feels remorse when he doesn't.'
p366
aVIt's like witchcraft, they turn everything upside-down."
p367
aVHe said, "I've got a tribunal coming up.
p368
aVWill you come to it?"
p369
aVSo I said okay.
p370
aa(lp371
VSo I went to his tribunal.
p372
aVAnd after 14 years in Broadmoor, they let him go.
p373
aVThey decided that he shouldn't be held indefinitely
p374
aVbecause he scores high on a checklist that might mean
p375
aVthat he would have a greater than average chance of recidivism.
p376
aVSo they let him go.
p377
aVAnd outside in the corridor he said to me,
p378
aV"You know what, Jon?
p379
aVEveryone's a bit psychopathic."
p380
aVHe said, "You are, I am. Well, obviously I am."
p381
aVI said, "What are you going to do now?"
p382
aVHe said, "I'm going to go to Belgium.
p383
aVThere's a woman there that I fancy.
p384
aVBut she's married, so I'm going to have to get her split up from her husband."
p385
aa(lp386
V(Laughter)
p387
aa(lp388
VAnyway, that was two years ago,
p389
aVand that's where my book ended.
p390
aVAnd for the last 20 months, everything was fine.
p391
aVNothing bad happened.
p392
aVHe was living with a girl outside London.
p393
aVHe was, according to Brian the Scientologist,
p394
aVmaking up for lost time, which I know sounds ominous,
p395
aVbut isn't necessarily ominous.
p396
aVUnfortunately, after 20 months,
p397
aVhe did go back to jail for a month.
p398
aVHe got into a "fracas" in a bar, he called it.
p399
aVEnded up going to jail for a month, which I know is bad,
p400
aVbut at least a month implies that whatever the fracas was,
p401
aVit wasn't too bad.
p402
aa(lp403
VAnd then he phoned me.
p404
aVAnd you know what, I think it's right that Tony is out.
p405
aVBecause you shouldn't define people by their maddest edges.
p406
aVAnd what Tony is, is he's a semi-psychopath.
p407
aVHe's a gray area in a world that doesn't like gray areas.
p408
aVBut the gray areas are where you find the complexity.
p409
aVIt's where you find the humanity,
p410
aVand it's where you find the truth.
p411
aVAnd Tony said to me,
p412
aV"Jon, could I buy you a drink in a bar?
p413
aVI just want to thank you for everything you've done for me."
p414
aVAnd I didn't go.
p415
aVWhat would you have done?
p416
aa(lp417
VThank you.
