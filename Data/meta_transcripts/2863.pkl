V[Yoruba: Freeborn Ijebu-Ode son,]
p4
aV[of true Ogbogbo Clan,]
p5
aV[whose wealth and resources surpass all that Europe ever had,]
p6
aV[whose altar is filled with gold.]
p7
aa(lp8
VThis chant is called the oríkì.
p9
aVMy grandmother used to sing it to me when I was a child in Nigeria.
p10
aVSee, an oríkì is the song of praise of the Yoruba people,
p11
aVand this particularly speaks of treasures that the West does not have.
p12
aa(lp13
VMama \u2014 that's what I call my grandmother \u2014
p14
aVtold me many stories about Yoruba mythology.
p15
aVYou see, the Yorubas are an ethnic group from the southwestern part of Nigeria,
p16
aVand I was always fascinated by these stories.
p17
aVI was always intrigued.
p18
aVAnd Yoruba culture has inspired my art since I was a child.
p19
aVYou see, African art is not just what you buy at Harlem markets in New York.
p20
aVEvery artist has a name,
p21
aVand every artist has a story.
p22
aVThis is my story.
p23
aa(lp24
VSee, mama had tattoos on her arms and her legs.
p25
aVAs a child, I thought she was born with them,
p26
aVwith beautiful black lines and detailed symbols.
p27
aVAnd then she told me
p28
aVthat they were actually symbols from the Yoruba mythology.
p29
aVI never knew how this was going to influence the artist that I am today.
p30
aVYou see, as a young child, I saw art everywhere.
p31
aVI remember the house we lived in in Ilorin, in Stadium Road.
p32
aVWe had marble floors,
p33
aVand you know, I would look at the marble floors,
p34
aVand I would see all sorts of patterns and designs in it,
p35
aVand I thought everybody could see them.
p36
aVSo I would call my brother, and I would be like,
p37
aV"Ikeolu, come and see this marble design, see this pattern, see this mask."
p38
aVAnd he would tell me, "Laolu, I don't see anything."
p39
aVSo I would use ink, and I would trace out what I saw on the floor.
p40
aVAnd then when my mom noticed, she got really upset.
p41
aa(lp42
V(Laughter)
p43
aa(lp44
VBut that didn't stop me.
p45
aVI switched from ink to chalk,
p46
aVbecause I got in trouble a lot with my teachers and my parents.
p47
aVSo I remember my mom said, "Laolu, we are Christians.
p48
aVWhy don't you draw like other people?
p49
aVWhy don't you draw landscapes or maybe you draw chairs or furniture,
p50
aVor maybe even draw Jesus?"
p51
aa(lp52
VYou know, I could paint the whole house if I had a chance,
p53
aVbut when I grew up, I knew being an artist was not an option,
p54
aVso I wanted to be the person my parents wanted me to be,
p55
aVso I went to law school.
p56
aVOf course, that's my dad there. He was so proud that day.
p57
aVAnd this was what my notebooks looked like in law school.
p58
aa(lp59
V(Laughter)
p60
aa(lp61
VOf course I would miss classes,
p62
aVand I would make up excuses why I wasn't going to class.
p63
aa(lp64
VBut when I started working at the Human Rights Commission
p65
aVas a human rights attorney,
p66
aVmy mind was elsewhere.
p67
aVI saw a very tough reality.
p68
aVI worked with children
p69
aVwho had to choose between getting an education
p70
aVand actually being forced into marriage.
p71
aVI was so frustrated seeing all the injustice around me,
p72
aVand my only outlet was art,
p73
aVso I started painting.
p74
aa(lp75
VThis piece is called "Dreamscape."
p76
aVSo when you zoom into this piece,
p77
aVyou're going to see a girl child
p78
aVand the accidental birth,
p79
aVthe fact that our future is controlled by where we are born.
p80
aVNow, the next one you see a man and a man holding hands,
p81
aVa woman and a woman holding hands.
p82
aVYou see, in Nigeria, same-sex relationship is criminalized.
p83
aVYou can actually get 14 years for that.
p84
aa(lp85
VWith my art, I like to tell stories.
p86
aVThrough my art, I like to start a conversation.
p87
aVSo in this one, you see the map of Africa,
p88
aVyou see the questions, you see crying,
p89
aVand there you see syringes plugged into Africa
p90
aVand the natural resources being drained out.
p91
aVSo I asked myself, where does it go?
p92
aVWho benefits from all of this?
p93
aVYou see, with my art,
p94
aVthe way I weave my art around the patterns, the masks, the stories,
p95
aVand the way I use my lines,
p96
aVit's all from the Yoruba culture.
p97
aa(lp98
VSo in 2013, I made a big gamble.
p99
aVI quit my job and I moved to New York City to practice art full time.
p100
aVOf course, my parents were like,
p101
aV"Oh, [it's just a phase.] He'll come back."
p102
aVBut life as an artist in New York was not easy,
p103
aVbecause I was broke,
p104
aVno money, no gallery agents, no representation,
p105
aVso no gallery would show my work.
p106
aVSo I thought to myself, I need to survive.
p107
aVSo I started painting on clothes to make a living.
p108
aVI started painting on shoes.
p109
aVI started customizing things for people.
p110
aVAnd then soon I realized the power,
p111
aVbecause people were so proud to wear their stories.
p112
aVSo I started painting on everything.
p113
aVI painted on guitars,
p114
aVI started doing murals,
p115
aVanything I could find my hand on I painted,
p116
aVand everything became my canvas.
p117
aa(lp118
VSo one day, I was just going on my Instagram feed,
p119
aVand I saw this picture.
p120
aVIt was Reign. She took a picture standing in front my art,
p121
aVand the moment I saw that photo,
p122
aVsomething happened in that moment.
p123
aVI could actually see my artwork go into her and come out of her literally,
p124
aVand that's how I started painting on human bodies.
p125
aVAs a child I saw art on the marble floors,
p126
aVI saw art on walls,
p127
aVbut now I see art on people's faces and people's bodies.
p128
aVI remember my grandmother,
p129
aVand I realized that most of my creative instincts
p130
aVwere actually based on my childhood memories
p131
aVand the art on my grandmother's skin.
p132
aa(lp133
VNow I look at all the people I painted, and I think to myself, like,
p134
aVwhat would it look like if we all walked around
p135
aVlike gods and goddesses from Yoruba mythology?
p136
aVAnd boom, that's how The Sacred Art of the Ori was born.
p137
aVYou see, Ori in Yoruba mythology
p138
aVmeans your soul, it means your essence, it means your instincts.
p139
aVAnd I realized that only when you tap into your Ori,
p140
aVthen you can actually move mountains.
p141
aVSo there's something so immediate about painting on human bodies.
p142
aVIt's like art in motion.
p143
aVIt's like a 3D experience.
p144
aa(lp145
VSo one day, I was just doing my regular work in Brooklyn,
p146
aVand I got an email that said,
p147
aV"Hi, I'm a big fan of your work.
p148
aVWould you like to paint for my music video?
p149
aVSigned, Beyoncé."
p150
aVLike, Beyoncé emailed me.
p151
aVI was like, what?
p152
aa(lp153
V(Laughter)
p154
aa(lp155
VI was like, what, how did she even know me?
p156
aVI thought this can't be true. Of course I thought it was a scam.
p157
aVThe Nigerian in me was like, nah.
p158
aa(lp159
V(Laughter)
p160
aa(lp161
V(Applause)
p162
aa(lp163
VBut incredibly enough, it was real, it was true,
p164
aVand things happened really fast.
p165
aVYou see, Beyoncé wanted to pay homage to New Orleans,
p166
aVand my art reminded her of her creole origins.
p167
aVSo when "Lemonade" dropped, of course,
p168
aVboom, everything just went from zero to 100 real fast.
p169
aVPeople featured me in magazines,
p170
aVinterviews.
p171
aVPeople stopped me in the street.
p172
aVPeople knew my name, like \u2014
p173
aVAnd sometimes I had to step back
p174
aVand just chill, and, like, take everything in.
p175
aVYou know, as artists, we work so hard all our lives
p176
aVfor our art to be recognized,
p177
aVand for this I feel blessed.
p178
aVHowever, the attorney in me is still there,
p179
aVso I use my art to fight for what I believe in.
p180
aVMy Yoruba heritage is always there.
p181
aa(lp182
VI'd like to share with you tonight some of my art in motion.
p183
aVPlease, welcome with me on stage.
p184
aa(lp185
V(Music)
p186
aa(lp187
V(Applause)
p188
aa(lp189
VNow, this is Geli, and this is Reign.
p190
aVThese are the first two people I ever painted in my life,
p191
aVand I spent the past day painting on them.
p192
aVTonight, they represent my hopes and my fears.
p193
aVNow, I put my fears on the back.
p194
aVI put my hopes in front.
p195
aVWhat are my hopes?
p196
aVI hope that people know
p197
aVthat Africa is not just one huge, nameless continent
p198
aVthat is all the same.
p199
aVI also hope that people know
p200
aVthat in Nigeria, we have over 350 ethnic groups and languages,
p201
aVand I am just one artist from one of them.
p202
aa(lp203
V(Applause)
p204
aa(lp205
VI also hope that you know that I hope I will be able to change
p206
aVthe way people talk about African art on the continent and here,
p207
aVand I hope you know that African art
p208
aVis not just what you buy at Harlem markets in New York
p209
aVand that every piece of art you see has a story,
p210
aVand every artist has a name.
p211
aa(lp212
VThank you very much.
