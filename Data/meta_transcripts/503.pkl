VI was asked by Wilsonart International,
p4
aVa plastic laminate company, which is
p5
aVthe largest plastic laminate company in the world \u2014
p6
aVthey asked me to design
p7
aVa trade show booth
p8
aVfor exhibition at the International Contemporary Furniture Fair
p9
aVin New York, in 2000.
p10
aa(lp11
VSo looking at their three main markets
p12
aVfor their product which were basically
p13
aVtransportation design,
p14
aVinteriors and furniture,
p15
aVwe came up with the solution of taking
p16
aVan old Airstream trailer and gutting it,
p17
aVand trying to portray laminate,
p18
aVand a trailer, in kind of a
p19
aVfresh, new contemporary look.
p20
aVWhen this trailer showed up at my shop
p21
aVin Berkeley, I'd actually never stepped foot in
p22
aVan Airstream trailer, or any other trailer.
p23
aVSo I can be somebody that can look at this
p24
aVin a totally fresh perspective and see if I can
p25
aVoptimize it in its most idealistic fashion.
p26
aVI decided I had to do some research
p27
aVand really figure out what had gone wrong
p28
aVsomewhere along the history of Airstream.
p29
aVWhat I discovered in these interiors is that
p30
aVthere was a disconnect between the exterior shell
p31
aVand the interior architecture of the pieces.
p32
aVIn that the shell was originally conceived
p33
aVas a lightweight, modern, futuristic,
p34
aVhigh-tech pod for hurtling down the freeway, and
p35
aVthe interiors were completely out of sync with that.
p36
aVIn fact it appeared like they
p37
aVreferenced a mountain cabin.
p38
aa(lp39
VThat seemed really like a crisis to me,
p40
aVthat they had never been able to
p41
aVdevelop a vocabulary
p42
aVabout escape, and about travel, and modernity
p43
aVin this trailer that was consistent with the shell.
p44
aVWe really needed to do some archeology
p45
aVin the trailer itself to figure out what's authentic
p46
aVin an Airstream trailer,
p47
aVand what feels like it has true purpose and utility.
p48
aVWe stripped out all the vinyl
p49
aVand zolatone paint that was covering up
p50
aVthis just fantastic aluminum shell.
p51
aVWe took off all the visible hardware and trim
p52
aVthat was kind of doing the country cabin thing.
p53
aVI literally drew on the walls of the trailer,
p54
aVmocked it up in cardboard,
p55
aVwe'd come in and cut, decide things were wrong,
p56
aVpull it out, put it back in.
p57
aa(lp58
VThe main goal was to smooth out the interior,
p59
aVand begin to speak about motion,
p60
aVand mobility, and independence.
p61
aVThe biggest difficulty on one of these trailers
p62
aVis that when you're designing there's actually no
p63
aVlogical place to stop and start materials
p64
aVbecause of the continuous form of the trailer.
p65
aVThere's no such things as two walls and a ceiling
p66
aVcoming together, where you can change materials and shapes.
p67
aVSo that became a challenge.
p68
aVCompounding that,
p69
aVthe material of choice, laminate,
p70
aVthat I was trying to highlight,
p71
aVonly bends in two dimensions.
p72
aVIt's a compound curve interior.
p73
aVWhat I had to devise was
p74
aVa way of fooling the eye
p75
aVinto believing that all these panels
p76
aVare curved with the shell.
p77
aa(lp78
VWhat I came up with was
p79
aVa series of second skins
p80
aVthat basically float over the aluminum shell.
p81
aVAnd what I was trying to do there was
p82
aVdirect your eye in the space,
p83
aVso that you would perceive the geometry in a different way,
p84
aVand that the casework wouldn't break up the space.
p85
aVThey also gave us a way to run power
p86
aVand rewire the trailer without tearing out the skin,
p87
aVso they function as an electrical chase.
p88
aVThat's the trailer, pretty much finished.
p89
aa(lp90
VThat trailer led to another commission,
p91
aVto participate in whats called Tokyo Designers Block.
p92
aVIts a week of furniture design events in Tokyo, in October.
p93
aVTeruo Kurosaki, who owns a furniture company called Idee,
p94
aVhe asked me to ship him two trailers to Tokyo.
p95
aVHe said one he would like to
p96
aVmake a real trailer, functioning, and we would sell that one.
p97
aVTrailer number two, you have a blank slate, you can to anything you want.
p98
aa(lp99
VWe came up with a fantasy scenario
p100
aVof a DJ traveling around the States,
p101
aVthat would collect records and go on tours.
p102
aVThis trailer housed two turntables,
p103
aVmixer, wet bar, fridge, integrated sound system.
p104
aVIt's got a huge couch, fits quite a few people,
p105
aVand basically we'd had a great time with this.
p106
aVAnd so in this trailer I took it upon myself to think about travel,
p107
aVand escape, in an idiosyncratic sense.
p108
aVA lot of these ideas migrated into
p109
aVthe production trailers for Airstream.
p110
aa(lp111
VThis brings us up to the time that I started consulting to Airstream.
p112
aVThey came to me and said,
p113
aV"Well, what can we do to freshen this thing up?
p114
aVAnd do you think kids, you know, skateboarders, surfers,
p115
aVrock climbers, would use these things?"
p116
aVAnd I said, "Well, not in that interior."
p117
aV(Laughter)
p118
aVAnyway, I went out to Airstream
p119
aVabout six times during the process of building this prototype,
p120
aVand it's called the Bambi prototype.
p121
aVI thought, "Finally, oh yeah great,
p122
aVbig company, I'm gonna work with somebody with money
p123
aVfor tooling and molding."
p124
aVAnd I walked in their prototype facility, and
p125
aVit's exactly like my shop, only bigger \u2014
p126
aVsame tools, same things.
p127
aVSo the problem became \u2014 and they set this dilemma to me \u2014
p128
aVthat you have to design the interior using only our existing technology,
p129
aVand there's no money for tooling or molding.
p130
aVThe trailers themselves are actually hand-built.
p131
aVAll the casework is hand-scribed in, uniquely,
p132
aVso you can't just cut 100 parts for 100 trailers,
p133
aVyou have to cut them big, and every single one is hand-fit.
p134
aVThey didn't want to go to a componentized system.
p135
aVAnd there it is, that's the Bambi 16.
