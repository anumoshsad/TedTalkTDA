VCome with me to the bottom of the world,
p4
aVAntarctica,
p5
aVthe highest, driest, windiest,
p6
aVand yes, coldest region on Earth \u2014
p7
aVmore arid than the Sahara
p8
aVand, in parts, colder than Mars.
p9
aVThe ice of Antarctica glows
p10
aVwith a light so dazzling,
p11
aVit blinds the unprotected eye.
p12
aVEarly explorers rubbed cocaine in their eyes
p13
aVto kill the pain of it.
p14
aVThe weight of the ice is such that the entire continent
p15
aVsags below sea level, beneath its weight.
p16
aVYet, the ice of Antarctica
p17
aVis a calendar of climate change.
p18
aVIt records the annual rise and fall
p19
aVof greenhouse gases and temperatures
p20
aVgoing back before the onset of the last ice ages.
p21
aVNowhere on Earth
p22
aVoffers us such a perfect record.
p23
aVAnd here, scientists are drilling
p24
aVinto the past of our planet
p25
aVto find clues to the future
p26
aVof climate change.
p27
aa(lp28
VThis past January,
p29
aVI traveled to a place called WAIS Divide,
p30
aVabout 600 miles from the South Pole.
p31
aVIt is the best place on the planet, many say,
p32
aVto study the history of climate change.
p33
aVThere, about 45 scientists from the University of Wisconsin,
p34
aVthe Desert Research Institute in Nevada and others
p35
aVhave been working to answer a central question
p36
aVabout global warming.
p37
aVWhat is the exact relationship
p38
aVbetween levels of greenhouse gases
p39
aVand planetary temperatures?
p40
aVIt's urgent work. We know that temperatures are rising.
p41
aVThis past May was the warmest worldwide on record.
p42
aVAnd we know that levels of greenhouse gases are rising too.
p43
aVWhat we don't know
p44
aVis the exact, precise, immediate
p45
aVimpact of these changes
p46
aVon natural climate patterns \u2014
p47
aVwinds, ocean currents,
p48
aVprecipitation rates, cloud formation,
p49
aVthings that bear on the health and well-being
p50
aVof billions of people.
p51
aa(lp52
VTheir entire camp, every item of gear,
p53
aVwas ferried 885 miles
p54
aVfrom McMurdo Station,
p55
aVthe main U.S. supply base
p56
aVon the coast of Antarctica.
p57
aVWAIS Divide itself though,
p58
aVis a circle of tents in the snow.
p59
aVIn blizzard winds, the crew sling ropes between the tents
p60
aVso that people can feel their way safely
p61
aVto the nearest ice house
p62
aVand to the nearest outhouse.
p63
aVIt snows so heavily there,
p64
aVthe installation was almost immediately buried.
p65
aVIndeed, the researchers picked this site
p66
aVbecause ice and snow accumulates here
p67
aV10 times faster than anywhere else in Antarctica.
p68
aVThey have to dig themselves out every day.
p69
aVIt makes for an exotic
p70
aVand chilly commute.
p71
aa(lp72
V(Laughter)
p73
aa(lp74
VBut under the surface
p75
aVis a hive of industrial activity
p76
aVcentered around an eight-million-dollar drill assembly.
p77
aVPeriodically, this drill, like a biopsy needle,
p78
aVplunges thousands of feet deep into the ice
p79
aVto extract a marrow of gases
p80
aVand isotopes for analysis.
p81
aVTen times a day, they extract
p82
aVthe 10-foot long cylinder of compressed ice crystals
p83
aVthat contain the unsullied air and trace chemicals
p84
aVlaid down by snow,
p85
aVseason after season for thousands of years.
p86
aVIt's really a time machine.
p87
aVAt the peak of activity earlier this year,
p88
aVthe researchers lowered the drill
p89
aVan extra hundred feet deeper into the ice every day
p90
aVand another 365 years
p91
aVdeeper into the past.
p92
aVPeriodically, they remove
p93
aVa cylinder of ice,
p94
aVlike gamekeepers popping a spent shotgun shell
p95
aVfrom the barrel of a drill.
p96
aVThey inspect it, they check it for cracks,
p97
aVfor drill damage, for spalls, for chips.
p98
aa(lp99
VMore importantly,
p100
aVthey prepare it for inspection and analysis
p101
aVby 27 independent laboratories
p102
aVin the United States and Europe,
p103
aVwho will examine it for 40 different trace chemicals
p104
aVrelated to climate,
p105
aVsome in parts per quadrillion.
p106
aVYes, I said that with a Q, quadrillion.
p107
aVThey cut the cylinders up into three-foot sections
p108
aVfor easier handling and shipment
p109
aVback to these labs,
p110
aVsome 8,000 miles from the drill site.
p111
aVEach cylinder
p112
aVis a parfait of time.
p113
aa(lp114
VThis ice formed as snow
p115
aV15,800 years ago,
p116
aVwhen our ancestors were daubing themselves with paint
p117
aVand considering the radical new technology
p118
aVof the alphabet.
p119
aVBathed in polarized light
p120
aVand cut in cross-section,
p121
aVthis ancient ice reveals itself
p122
aVas a mosaic of colors,
p123
aVeach one showing how conditions at depth in the ice
p124
aVhave affected this material
p125
aVat depths where pressures can reach
p126
aVa ton per square inch.
p127
aVEvery year, it begins with a snowflake,
p128
aVand by digging into fresh snow,
p129
aVwe can see how this process is ongoing today.
p130
aVThis wall of undisturbed snow,
p131
aVback-lit by sunlight,
p132
aVshows the striations of winter and summer snow,
p133
aVlayer upon layer.
p134
aVEach storm scours the atmosphere,
p135
aVwashing out dust, soot,
p136
aVtrace chemicals,
p137
aVand depositing them on the snow pack
p138
aVyear after year,
p139
aVmillennia after millennia,
p140
aVcreating a kind of periodic table of elements
p141
aVthat at this point
p142
aVis more than 11,000 feet thick.
p143
aVFrom this, we can detect an extraordinary number of things.
p144
aVWe can see the calcium
p145
aVfrom the world's deserts,
p146
aVsoot from distant wildfires,
p147
aVmethane as an indicator of the strength of a Pacific monsoon,
p148
aVall wafted on winds from warmer latitudes
p149
aVto this remote and very cold place.
p150
aa(lp151
VMost importantly,
p152
aVthese cylinders and this snow
p153
aVtrap air.
p154
aVEach cylinder is about 10 percent ancient air,
p155
aVa pristine time capsule
p156
aVof greenhouse gases \u2014 carbon dioxide,
p157
aVmethane, nitrous oxide \u2014
p158
aVall unchanged from the day that snow formed
p159
aVand first fell.
p160
aVAnd this is the object of their scrutiny.
p161
aVBut don't we already know
p162
aVwhat we need to know about greenhouse gases?
p163
aVWhy do we need to study this anymore?
p164
aVDon't we already know how they affect temperatures?
p165
aVDon't we already know the consequences
p166
aVof a changing climate on our settled civilization?
p167
aVThe truth is, we only know the outlines,
p168
aVand what we don't completely understand,
p169
aVwe can't properly fix.
p170
aVIndeed, we run the risk of making things worse.
p171
aa(lp172
VConsider, the single most successful
p173
aVinternational environmental effort of the 20th century,
p174
aVthe Montreal Protocol,
p175
aVin which the nations of Earth banded together to protect the planet
p176
aVfrom the harmful effects of ozone-destroying chemicals
p177
aVused at that time
p178
aVin air conditioners, refrigerators and other cooling devices.
p179
aVWe banned those chemicals,
p180
aVand we replaced them, unknowingly,
p181
aVwith other substances
p182
aVthat, molecule per molecule,
p183
aVare a hundred times more potent
p184
aVas heat-trapping, greenhouse gases
p185
aVthan carbon dioxide.
p186
aa(lp187
VThis process requires
p188
aVextraordinary precautions.
p189
aVThe scientists must insure
p190
aVthat the ice is not contaminated.
p191
aVMoreover, in this 8,000-mile journey,
p192
aVthey have to insure this ice doesn't melt.
p193
aVImagine juggling a snowball across the tropics.
p194
aVThey have to, in fact,
p195
aVmake sure this ice never gets warmer
p196
aVthan about 20 degrees below zero,
p197
aVotherwise, the key gases inside it will dissipate.
p198
aVSo, in the coldest place on Earth,
p199
aVthey work inside a refrigerator.
p200
aVAs they handle the ice, in fact,
p201
aVthey keep an extra pair of gloves warming in an oven,
p202
aVso that, when their work gloves freeze
p203
aVand their fingers stiffen,
p204
aVthey can don a fresh pair.
p205
aVThey work against the clock and against the thermometer.
p206
aa(lp207
VSo far, they've packed up
p208
aVabout 4,500 feet of ice cores
p209
aVfor shipment back to the United States.
p210
aVThis past season,
p211
aVthey manhandled them across the ice
p212
aVto waiting aircraft.
p213
aVThe 109th Air National Guard
p214
aVflew the most recent shipment of ice
p215
aVback to the coast of Antarctica,
p216
aVwhere it was boarded onto a freighter,
p217
aVshipped across the tropics to California,
p218
aVunloaded, put on a truck,
p219
aVdriven across the desert
p220
aVto the National Ice Core Laboratory in Denver, Colorado,
p221
aVwhere, as we speak,
p222
aVscientists are now slicing this material up
p223
aVfor samples, for analysis,
p224
aVto be distributed
p225
aVto the laboratories around the country
p226
aVand in Europe.
p227
aa(lp228
VAntarctica was this planet's
p229
aVlast empty quarter \u2014
p230
aVthe blind spot
p231
aVin our expanding vision of the world.
p232
aVEarly explorers
p233
aVsailed off the edge of the map,
p234
aVand they found a place
p235
aVwhere the normal rules of time and temperature
p236
aVseem suspended.
p237
aVHere, the ice seems a living presence.
p238
aVThe wind that rubs against it
p239
aVgives it voice.
p240
aVIt is a voice of experience.
p241
aVIt is a voice we should heed.
