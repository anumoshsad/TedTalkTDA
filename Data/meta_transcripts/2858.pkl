VSomeday, we may have robots as smart as people,
p4
aVartificial intelligence, AI.
p5
aVHow could that happen?
p6
aVOne route is that we'll just keep accumulating better software,
p7
aVlike we've been doing for 70 years.
p8
aVAt past rates of progress, that may take centuries.
p9
aVSome say it'll happen a lot faster
p10
aVas we discover grand new powerful theories of intelligence.
p11
aVI'm skeptical.
p12
aa(lp13
VBut a third scenario
p14
aVis what I'm going to talk about today.
p15
aVThe idea is to port the software from the human brain.
p16
aVTo do this, we're going to need three technologies to be good enough,
p17
aVand none of them are there yet.
p18
aVFirst, we're going to need lots of cheap, fast, parallel computers.
p19
aVSecond, we're going to need to scan individual human brains
p20
aVin fine spatial and chemical detail,
p21
aVto see exactly what cells are where, connected to what, of what type.
p22
aVAnd third, we're going to need computer models
p23
aVof how each kind of brain cell works \u2014
p24
aVtaking input signals, changing interval state
p25
aVand sending output signals.
p26
aVIf we have good enough models of all the kinds of brain cells
p27
aVand a good enough model of the brain,
p28
aVwe can put it together to make a good enough model of an entire brain,
p29
aVand that model would have the same input-output behavior as the original.
p30
aVSo if you talk to it, it might talk back.
p31
aVIf you ask it to do things, it might do them.
p32
aVAnd if we could do that, everything would change.
p33
aa(lp34
VPeople have been talking about this idea for decades,
p35
aVunder the name of "uploads."
p36
aVI'm going to call them "ems."
p37
aVWhen they talk about it, they say,
p38
aV"Is this even possible?
p39
aVIf you made one, would it be conscious? Or is it just an empty machine?
p40
aVIf you made one of me, is that me or someone else?"
p41
aVThese are all fascinating questions that I'm going to ignore ...
p42
aa(lp43
V(Laughter)
p44
aa(lp45
Vbecause I see a neglected question:
p46
aVWhat would actually happen?
p47
aVI became obsessed with this question.
p48
aVI spent four years trying to analyze it,
p49
aVusing standard academic tools, to guess what would happen,
p50
aVand I'm here to tell you what I found.
p51
aVBut be warned \u2014
p52
aVI'm not offering inspiration, I'm offering analysis.
p53
aVI see my job as telling you what's most likely to happen
p54
aVif we did the least to avoid it.
p55
aVIf you aren't at least a bit disturbed by something I tell you here,
p56
aVyou're just not paying attention.
p57
aa(lp58
V(Laughter)
p59
aa(lp60
VOK, the first thing I can tell you
p61
aVis that ems spend most of their life in virtual reality.
p62
aVThis is what you might look like if you were using virtual reality.
p63
aVAnd this is what you might see:
p64
aVsunlight glinting off of water, you might hear gulls flying above,
p65
aVyou might even feel the wind on your cheeks or smell seawater,
p66
aVwith advanced hardware.
p67
aVNow, if you were to spend a lot of time here,
p68
aVyou might want a dashboard
p69
aVwhere you could do things like make a phone call,
p70
aVmove to a new virtual world,
p71
aVcheck your bank account.
p72
aa(lp73
VNow, while this is what you would look like in virtual reality,
p74
aVthis is what an em would look like in virtual reality.
p75
aVIt's computer hardware sitting in a server rack somewhere.
p76
aVBut still, it could see and experience the same thing.
p77
aVBut some things are different for ems.
p78
aVFirst, while you'll probably always notice that virtual reality isn't entirely real,
p79
aVto an em, it can feel as real to them as this room feels to you now
p80
aVor as anything ever feels.
p81
aVAnd ems also have some more action possibilities.
p82
aa(lp83
VFor example, your mind just always runs at the same speed,
p84
aVbut an em can add more or less computer hardware to run faster or slower,
p85
aVand therefore, if the world around them seems to be going too fast,
p86
aVthey can just speed up their mind,
p87
aVand the world around them would seem to slow down.
p88
aa(lp89
VIn addition, an em can make a copy of itself at that moment.
p90
aVThis copy would remember everything the same,
p91
aVand if it starts out with the same speed, looking at the same speed,
p92
aVit might even need to be told, "You are the copy."
p93
aVAnd em could make archive copies,
p94
aVand with enough archives,
p95
aVan em can be immortal \u2014
p96
aVin principle, though not usually in practice.
p97
aVAnd an em can move its brain, the computer that represents its brain,
p98
aVfrom one physical location to another.
p99
aVEms can actually move around the world at the speed of light,
p100
aVand by moving to a new location,
p101
aVthey can interact more quickly with ems near that new location.
p102
aa(lp103
VSo far, I've been talking about what ems can do.
p104
aVWhat do ems choose to do?
p105
aVTo understand that, we'll need to understand three key facts.
p106
aVFirst, ems by definition do what the human they emulate would do
p107
aVin the same situation.
p108
aVSo their lives and behavior are very human.
p109
aVThey're mainly different because they're living in a different world.
p110
aVSecond, ems need real resources to survive.
p111
aVYou need food and shelter or you'll die.
p112
aVAlso, ems need computer hardware, energy, cooling, or they can't exist.
p113
aVFor every subjective minute that an em experiences,
p114
aVsomeone, usually that em, had to work to pay for it.
p115
aVThird, ems are poor.
p116
aa(lp117
V(Laughter)
p118
aa(lp119
VThe em population can grow quicker than the em economy,
p120
aVso that means wages fall down to em subsistence levels.
p121
aVThat means ems have to be working most of the time.
p122
aVSo that means this is what ems usually see:
p123
aVbeautiful and luxurious, but desks \u2014
p124
aVthey're working most of the time.
p125
aVNow, a subsistence wage scenario, you might think, is exotic and strange,
p126
aVbut it's actually the usual case in human history,
p127
aVand it's how pretty much all wild animals have ever lived,
p128
aVso we know what humans do in this situation.
p129
aVHumans basically do what it takes to survive,
p130
aVand this is what lets me say so much about the em world.
p131
aVWhen creatures are rich, like you,
p132
aVyou have to know a lot about what they want
p133
aVto figure out what they do.
p134
aVWhen creatures are poor,
p135
aVyou know that they mostly do what it takes to survive.
p136
aa(lp137
VSo we've been talking about the em world from the point of view of the ems \u2014
p138
aVnow, let's step back and look at their whole world.
p139
aVFirst, the em world grows much faster than ours,
p140
aVroughly a hundred times faster.
p141
aVSo the amount of change we would experience in a century or two,
p142
aVthey would experience in a year or two.
p143
aVAnd I'm not really willing to project this age much beyond that,
p144
aVbecause plausibly by then something else will happen, I don't know what.
p145
aVSecond, the typical emulation runs even faster,
p146
aVroughly a thousand times human speed.
p147
aVSo for them, they experience thousands of years in this year or two,
p148
aVand for them, the world around them is actually changing more slowly
p149
aVthan your world seems to change for you.
p150
aVThird, ems are crammed together in a small number of very dense cities.
p151
aVThis is not only how they see themselves in virtual reality,
p152
aVit's also how they actually are physically crammed together.
p153
aVSo at em speeds, physical travel feels really painfully slow,
p154
aVso most em cities are self-sufficient,
p155
aVmost war is cyber war,
p156
aVand most of the rest of the earth away from the em cities
p157
aVis left to the humans, because the ems really aren't that interested in it.
p158
aa(lp159
VSpeaking of humans,
p160
aVyou were wanting to hear about that.
p161
aVHumans must retire, at once, for good.
p162
aVThey just can't compete.
p163
aVNow, humans start out owning all of the capital in this world.
p164
aVThe economy grows very fast, their wealth grows very fast.
p165
aVHumans get rich, collectively.
p166
aVAs you may know, most humans today don't actually own that much
p167
aVbesides their ability to work,
p168
aVso between now and then, they need to acquire sufficient assets,
p169
aVinsurance or sharing arrangements,
p170
aVor they may starve.
p171
aVI highly recommend avoiding this outcome.
p172
aa(lp173
V(Laughter)
p174
aa(lp175
VNow, you might wonder,
p176
aVwhy would ems let humans exist?
p177
aVWhy not kill them, take their stuff?
p178
aVBut notice we have many unproductive retirees around us today,
p179
aVand we don't kill them and take their stuff.
p180
aa(lp181
V(Laughter)
p182
aa(lp183
VIn part, that's because it would disrupt the institutions we share with them.
p184
aVOther groups would wonder who's next,
p185
aVso plausibly, ems may well let humans retire in peace during the age of em.
p186
aVYou should worry more that the age of em only lasts a year or two
p187
aVand you don't know what happens next.
p188
aa(lp189
VEms are very much like humans,
p190
aVbut they are not like the typical human.
p191
aVThe typical em is a copy of the few hundred most productive humans.
p192
aVSo in fact, they are as elite, compared to the typical human,
p193
aVas the typical billionaire, Nobel Prize winner,
p194
aVOlympic gold medalist, head of state.
p195
aVEms look on humans perhaps with nostalgia and gratitude,
p196
aVbut not so much respect,
p197
aVwhich is, if you think about it, how you think about your ancestors.
p198
aVWe know many things about how humans differ in terms of productivity.
p199
aVWe can just use those to predict features of ems \u2014
p200
aVfor example, they tend to be smart, conscientious, hard-working,
p201
aVmarried, religious, middle-aged.
p202
aVThese are features of ems.
p203
aa(lp204
VEm world also contains enormous variety.
p205
aVNot only does it continue on with most of the kinds of variety that humans do,
p206
aVincluding variety of industry and profession,
p207
aVthey also have many new kinds of variety,
p208
aVand one of the most important is mind speed.
p209
aVEms can plausibly go from human speed
p210
aVup to a million times faster than human speed,
p211
aVand down to a billion times slower than human speed.
p212
aVFaster ems tend to have markers of high status.
p213
aVThey embody more wealth. They win arguments.
p214
aVThey sit at premium locations.
p215
aVSlower ems are mostly retirees,
p216
aVand they are like the ghosts of our literature.
p217
aVIf you recall, ghosts are all around us \u2014
p218
aVyou can interact with them if you pay the price.
p219
aVBut they don't know much, they can't influence much,
p220
aVand they're obsessed with the past, so what's the point?
p221
aa(lp222
V(Laughter)
p223
aa(lp224
VEms also have more variety in the structure of their lives.
p225
aVThis is your life: you start and you end, really simple.
p226
aVThis is the life of an em,
p227
aVwho every day splits off some short-term copies
p228
aVto do short-term tasks and then end.
p229
aVWe'll talk more about those short term versions in a moment,
p230
aVbut they are much more efficient
p231
aVbecause they don't have to rest for the next day.
p232
aVThis em is more opportunistic.
p233
aVThey make more copies of themselves when there's more demand for that.
p234
aVThey don't know which way the future's going.
p235
aa(lp236
VThis is an em designer,
p237
aVwho conceives of a large system
p238
aVand then breaks recursively into copies who elaborate that,
p239
aVso ems can implement larger, more coherent designs.
p240
aVThis an emulation plumber
p241
aVwho remembers that every day, for the last 20 years,
p242
aVthey only ever worked two hours a day, a life of leisure.
p243
aVBut what really happened is, every day they had a thousand copies,
p244
aVeach of whom did a two-hour plumbing job,
p245
aVand only one of them went on to the next day.
p246
aVObjectively, they're working well over 99 percent of the time.
p247
aVSubjectively, they remember a life of leisure.
p248
aa(lp249
V(Laughter)
p250
aa(lp251
VThis, again, is you. You start and you end.
p252
aVThis could be you if at the start of party,
p253
aVyou took a drug that meant you would not remember that party
p254
aVever after that day.
p255
aVSome people do this, I'm told.
p256
aVToward the end of the party,
p257
aVwill you say to yourself, "I'm about to die, this is terrible.
p258
aVThat person tomorrow isn't me, because they won't remember what I do."
p259
aVOr you could say, "I will go on tomorrow. I just won't remember what I did."
p260
aVThis is an em who splits off a short-term copy
p261
aVto do a short-term task and then end.
p262
aVThey have the same two attitude possibilities.
p263
aVThey can say, "I'm a new short-term creature with a short life. I hate this."
p264
aVOr "I'm a part of a larger creature who won't remember this part."
p265
aVI predict they'll have that second attitude,
p266
aVnot because it's philosophically correct, but because it helps them get along.
p267
aa(lp268
VToday, if the president says we must invade Iraq,
p269
aVand you say, "Why?"
p270
aVand they say, "State secret,"
p271
aVyou're not sure if you can trust them,
p272
aVbut for ems, a copy of the president and a copy of you can go inside a safe,
p273
aVexplain all their secret reasons,
p274
aVand then one bit comes out from your copy to yourself,
p275
aVtelling you if you were convinced.
p276
aVSo now you can know there is a good reason.
p277
aa(lp278
VI know you guys are all eager to evaluate this world.
p279
aVYou're eager to decide if you love it or hate it.
p280
aVBut think: your ancestors from thousands of years ago
p281
aVwould have loved or hated your world
p282
aVbased on the first few things they heard about it,
p283
aVbecause your world is really just weird.
p284
aVSo before judging a strange future world, you should really learn a lot about it,
p285
aVmaybe read a whole book about it,
p286
aVand then, if you don't like it, work to change it.
p287
aa(lp288
VThank you.
