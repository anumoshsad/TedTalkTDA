VProbably a lot of you know the story of the two salesmen
p4
aVwho went down to Africa in the 1900s.
p5
aVThey were sent down to find if there was any opportunity
p6
aVfor selling shoes,
p7
aVand they wrote telegrams back to Manchester.
p8
aVAnd one of them wrote,
p9
aV"Situation hopeless. Stop. They don't wear shoes."
p10
aVAnd the other one wrote,
p11
aV"Glorious opportunity. They don't have any shoes yet."
p12
aa(lp13
V(Laughter)
p14
aa(lp15
VNow, there's a similar situation in the classical music world,
p16
aVbecause there are some people who think that classical music is dying.
p17
aVAnd there are some of us who think you ain't seen nothing yet.
p18
aVAnd rather than go into statistics and trends,
p19
aVand tell you about all the orchestras that are closing,
p20
aVand the record companies that are folding,
p21
aVI thought we should do an experiment tonight.
p22
aVActually, it's not really an experiment, because I know the outcome.
p23
aa(lp24
V(Laughter)
p25
aa(lp26
VBut it's like an experiment.
p27
aVNow, before we start \u2014
p28
aa(lp29
V(Laughter)
p30
aa(lp31
VBefore we start, I need to do two things.
p32
aVOne is I want to remind you of what a seven-year-old child
p33
aVsounds like when he plays the piano.
p34
aVMaybe you have this child at home.
p35
aVHe sounds something like this.
p36
aa(lp37
V(Music)
p38
aa(lp39
V(Music ends)
p40
aa(lp41
VI see some of you recognize this child.
p42
aVNow, if he practices for a year and takes lessons, he's now eight
p43
aVand he sounds like this.
p44
aa(lp45
V(Music)
p46
aa(lp47
V(Music ends)
p48
aa(lp49
VHe practices for another year and takes lessons \u2014 he's nine.
p50
aa(lp51
V(Music)
p52
aa(lp53
V(Music ends)
p54
aa(lp55
VThen he practices for another year and takes lessons \u2014 now he's 10.
p56
aa(lp57
V(Music)
p58
aa(lp59
V(Music ends)
p60
aa(lp61
VAt that point, they usually give up.
p62
aa(lp63
V(Laughter)
p64
aa(lp65
V(Applause)
p66
aa(lp67
VNow, if you'd waited for one more year, you would have heard this.
p68
aa(lp69
V(Music)
p70
aa(lp71
V(Music ends)
p72
aa(lp73
VNow, what happened was not maybe what you thought,
p74
aVwhich is, he suddenly became passionate, engaged,
p75
aVinvolved, got a new teacher, he hit puberty, or whatever it is.
p76
aVWhat actually happened was the impulses were reduced.
p77
aVYou see, the first time, he was playing with an impulse on every note.
p78
aa(lp79
V(Music)
p80
aa(lp81
VAnd the second, with an impulse every other note.
p82
aa(lp83
V(Music)
p84
aa(lp85
VYou can see it by looking at my head.
p86
aa(lp87
V(Laughter)
p88
aa(lp89
VThe nine-year-old put an impulse on every four notes.
p90
aa(lp91
V(Music)
p92
aa(lp93
VThe 10-year-old, on every eight notes.
p94
aa(lp95
V(Music)
p96
aa(lp97
VAnd the 11-year-old, one impulse on the whole phrase.
p98
aa(lp99
V(Music)
p100
aa(lp101
VI don't know how we got into this position.
p102
aa(lp103
V(Laughter)
p104
aa(lp105
VI didn't say, "I'm going to move my shoulder over, move my body."
p106
aVNo, the music pushed me over,
p107
aVwhich is why I call it one-buttock playing.
p108
aa(lp109
V(Music)
p110
aa(lp111
VIt can be the other buttock.
p112
aa(lp113
V(Music)
p114
aa(lp115
VYou know, a gentleman was once watching a presentation I was doing,
p116
aVwhen I was working with a young pianist.
p117
aVHe was the president of a corporation in Ohio.
p118
aVI was working with this young pianist, and said,
p119
aV"The trouble with you is you're a two-buttock player.
p120
aVYou should be a one-buttock player."
p121
aVI moved his body while he was playing.
p122
aVAnd suddenly, the music took off. It took flight.
p123
aVThe audience gasped when they heard the difference.
p124
aVThen I got a letter from this gentleman.
p125
aVHe said, "I was so moved.
p126
aVI went back and I transformed my entire company
p127
aVinto a one-buttock company."
p128
aa(lp129
V(Laughter)
p130
aa(lp131
VNow, the other thing I wanted to do is to tell you about you.
p132
aVThere are 1,600 people, I believe.
p133
aVMy estimation is that probably 45 of you
p134
aVare absolutely passionate about classical music.
p135
aVYou adore classical music. Your FM is always on that classical dial.
p136
aVYou have CDs in your car, and you go to the symphony,
p137
aVyour children are playing instruments.
p138
aVYou can't imagine your life without classical music.
p139
aVThat's the first group, quite small.
p140
aVThen there's another bigger group.
p141
aVThe people who don't mind classical music.
p142
aa(lp143
V(Laughter)
p144
aa(lp145
VYou know, you've come home from a long day,
p146
aVand you take a glass of wine, and you put your feet up.
p147
aVA little Vivaldi in the background doesn't do any harm.
p148
aVThat's the second group.
p149
aVNow comes the third group:
p150
aVpeople who never listen to classical music.
p151
aVIt's just simply not part of your life.
p152
aVYou might hear it like second-hand smoke at the airport ...
p153
aa(lp154
V(Laughter)
p155
aa(lp156
V\u2014 and maybe a little bit of a march from "Aida"
p157
aVwhen you come into the hall.
p158
aVBut otherwise, you never hear it.
p159
aVThat's probably the largest group.
p160
aa(lp161
VAnd then there's a very small group.
p162
aVThese are the people who think they're tone-deaf.
p163
aVAmazing number of people think they're tone-deaf.
p164
aVActually, I hear a lot, "My husband is tone-deaf."
p165
aa(lp166
V(Laughter)
p167
aa(lp168
VActually, you cannot be tone-deaf.
p169
aVNobody is tone-deaf.
p170
aVIf you were tone-deaf, you couldn't change the gears
p171
aVon your car, in a stick shift car.
p172
aVYou couldn't tell the difference between
p173
aVsomebody from Texas and somebody from Rome.
p174
aVAnd the telephone. The telephone.
p175
aVIf your mother calls
p176
aVon the miserable telephone, she calls and says, "Hello,"
p177
aVyou not only know who it is, you know what mood she's in.
p178
aVYou have a fantastic ear. Everybody has a fantastic ear.
p179
aVSo nobody is tone-deaf.
p180
aa(lp181
VBut I tell you what.
p182
aVIt doesn't work for me to go on with this thing,
p183
aVwith such a wide gulf between those who understand,
p184
aVlove and are passionate about classical music,
p185
aVand those who have no relationship to it at all.
p186
aVThe tone-deaf people, they're no longer here.
p187
aVBut even between those three categories,
p188
aVit's too wide a gulf.
p189
aVSo I'm not going to go on until every single person in this room,
p190
aVdownstairs and in Aspen, and everybody else looking,
p191
aVwill come to love and understand classical music.
p192
aVSo that's what we're going to do.
p193
aa(lp194
VNow, you notice that there is not the slightest doubt in my mind
p195
aVthat this is going to work, if you look at my face, right?
p196
aVIt's one of the characteristics of a leader that he not doubt
p197
aVfor one moment the capacity of the people he's leading
p198
aVto realize whatever he's dreaming.
p199
aVImagine if Martin Luther King had said, "I have a dream.
p200
aVOf course, I'm not sure they'll be up to it."
p201
aa(lp202
V(Laughter)
p203
aa(lp204
VAll right. So I'm going to take a piece of Chopin.
p205
aVThis is a beautiful prelude by Chopin.
p206
aVSome of you will know it.
p207
aa(lp208
V(Music)
p209
aa(lp210
VDo you know what I think probably happened here?
p211
aVWhen I started, you thought, "How beautiful that sounds."
p212
aa(lp213
V(Music)
p214
aa(lp215
V"I don't think we should go to the same place
p216
aVfor our summer holidays next year."
p217
aa(lp218
V(Laughter)
p219
aa(lp220
VIt's funny, isn't it?
p221
aVIt's funny how those thoughts kind of waft into your head.
p222
aVAnd of course \u2014
p223
aa(lp224
V(Applause)
p225
aa(lp226
VOf course, if the piece is long and you've had a long day,
p227
aVyou might actually drift off.
p228
aVThen your companion will dig you in the ribs
p229
aVand say, "Wake up! It's culture!" And then you feel even worse.
p230
aa(lp231
V(Laughter)
p232
aa(lp233
VBut has it ever occurred to you that the reason you feel sleepy
p234
aVin classical music is not because of you, but because of us?
p235
aVDid anybody think while I was playing,
p236
aV"Why is he using so many impulses?"
p237
aVIf I'd done this with my head you certainly would have thought it.
p238
aa(lp239
V(Music)
p240
aa(lp241
V(Music ends)
p242
aa(lp243
VAnd for the rest of your life, every time you hear classical music,
p244
aVyou'll always be able to know if you hear those impulses.
p245
aa(lp246
VSo let's see what's really going on here.
p247
aVWe have a B. This is a B.
p248
aVThe next note is a C.
p249
aVAnd the job of the C is to make the B sad.
p250
aVAnd it does, doesn't it?
p251
aa(lp252
V(Laughter)
p253
aa(lp254
VComposers know that.
p255
aVIf they want sad music, they just play those two notes.
p256
aa(lp257
V(Music)
p258
aa(lp259
VBut basically, it's just a B, with four sads.
p260
aa(lp261
V(Laughter)
p262
aa(lp263
VNow, it goes down to A.
p264
aVNow to G.
p265
aVAnd then to F.
p266
aVSo we have B, A, G, F.
p267
aVAnd if we have B, A, G, F,
p268
aVwhat do we expect next?
p269
aa(lp270
V(Music)
p271
aa(lp272
VThat might have been a fluke.
p273
aVLet's try it again.
p274
aa(lp275
V(Music)
p276
aa(lp277
VOh, the TED choir.
p278
aa(lp279
V(Laughter)
p280
aa(lp281
VAnd you notice nobody is tone-deaf, right?
p282
aVNobody is.
p283
aVYou know, every village in Bangladesh
p284
aVand every hamlet in China \u2014 everybody knows:
p285
aVda, da, da, da \u2014 da.
p286
aVEverybody knows, who's expecting that E.
p287
aa(lp288
VChopin didn't want to reach the E there,
p289
aVbecause what will have happened?
p290
aVIt will be over, like Hamlet. Do you remember?
p291
aVAct One, scene three,
p292
aVhe finds out his uncle killed his father.
p293
aVHe keeps on going up to his uncle and almost killing him.
p294
aVAnd then he backs away, he goes up to him again, almost kills him.
p295
aVThe critics sitting in the back row there,
p296
aVthey have to have an opinion, so they say, "Hamlet is a procrastinator."
p297
aVOr they say, "Hamlet has an Oedipus complex."
p298
aVNo, otherwise the play would be over, stupid.
p299
aa(lp300
V(Laughter)
p301
aa(lp302
VThat's why Shakespeare puts all that stuff in Hamlet \u2014
p303
aVOphelia going mad, the play within the play,
p304
aVand Yorick's skull, and the gravediggers.
p305
aVThat's in order to delay \u2014
p306
aVuntil Act Five, he can kill him.
p307
aa(lp308
VIt's the same with the Chopin.
p309
aVHe's just about to reach the E,
p310
aVand he says, "Oops, better go back up and do it again."
p311
aVSo he does it again.
p312
aVNow, he gets excited.
p313
aa(lp314
V(Music)
p315
aa(lp316
VThat's excitement, don't worry about it.
p317
aVNow, he gets to F-sharp, and finally he goes down to E,
p318
aVbut it's the wrong chord \u2014
p319
aVbecause the chord he's looking for is this one,
p320
aVand instead he does ...
p321
aVNow, we call that a deceptive cadence,
p322
aVbecause it deceives us.
p323
aVI tell my students, "If you have a deceptive cadence,
p324
aVraise your eyebrows, and everybody will know."
p325
aa(lp326
V(Laughter)
p327
aa(lp328
V(Applause)
p329
aa(lp330
VRight.
p331
aVHe gets to E, but it's the wrong chord.
p332
aVNow, he tries E again.
p333
aVThat chord doesn't work.
p334
aVNow, he tries the E again. That chord doesn't work.
p335
aVNow, he tries E again, and that doesn't work.
p336
aVAnd then finally ...
p337
aVThere was a gentleman in the front row who went, "Mmm."
p338
aa(lp339
V(Laughter)
p340
aa(lp341
VIt's the same gesture he makes when he comes home
p342
aVafter a long day, turns off the key in his car and says,
p343
aV"Aah, I'm home."
p344
aVBecause we all know where home is.
p345
aa(lp346
VSo this is a piece which goes from away to home.
p347
aVI'm going to play it all the way through and you're going to follow.
p348
aVB, C, B, C, B, C, B \u2014
p349
aVdown to A, down to G, down to F.
p350
aVAlmost goes to E, but otherwise the play would be over.
p351
aVHe goes back up to B, he gets very excited.
p352
aVGoes to F-sharp. Goes to E.
p353
aVIt's the wrong chord. It's the wrong chord.
p354
aVAnd finally goes to E, and it's home.
p355
aVAnd what you're going to see is one-buttock playing.
p356
aa(lp357
V(Laughter)
p358
aa(lp359
VBecause for me, to join the B to the E,
p360
aVI have to stop thinking about every single note along the way,
p361
aVand start thinking about the long, long line from B to E.
p362
aa(lp363
VYou know, we were just in South Africa, and you can't go to South Africa
p364
aVwithout thinking of Mandela in jail for 27 years.
p365
aVWhat was he thinking about? Lunch?
p366
aVNo, he was thinking about the vision for South Africa
p367
aVand for human beings.
p368
aVThis is about vision. This is about the long line.
p369
aVLike the bird who flies over the field
p370
aVand doesn't care about the fences underneath, all right?
p371
aVSo now, you're going to follow the line all the way from B to E.
p372
aVAnd I've one last request before I play this piece all the way through.
p373
aVWould you think of somebody who you adore,
p374
aVwho's no longer there?
p375
aVA beloved grandmother, a lover \u2014
p376
aVsomebody in your life who you love with all your heart,
p377
aVbut that person is no longer with you.
p378
aVBring that person into your mind,
p379
aVand at the same time,
p380
aVfollow the line all the way from B to E,
p381
aVand you'll hear everything that Chopin had to say.
p382
aa(lp383
V(Music)
p384
aa(lp385
V(Music ends)
p386
aa(lp387
V(Applause)
p388
aa(lp389
VNow, you may be wondering \u2014
p390
aa(lp391
V(Applause)
p392
aa(lp393
V(Applause ends)
p394
aa(lp395
VYou may be wondering why I'm clapping.
p396
aVWell, I did this at a school in Boston
p397
aVwith about 70 seventh graders, 12-year-olds.
p398
aVI did exactly what I did with you,
p399
aVand I explained the whole thing.
p400
aVAt the end, they went crazy, clapping.
p401
aVI was clapping. They were clapping.
p402
aVFinally, I said, "Why am I clapping?"
p403
aVAnd one of them said, "Because we were listening."
p404
aa(lp405
V(Laughter)
p406
aa(lp407
VThink of it. 1,600 people, busy people,
p408
aVinvolved in all sorts of different things,
p409
aVlistening, understanding and being moved
p410
aVby a piece by Chopin.
p411
aVNow, that is something.
p412
aVAm I sure that every single person followed that,
p413
aVunderstood it, was moved by it?
p414
aVOf course, I can't be sure.
p415
aa(lp416
VBut I'll tell you what happened to me in Ireland
p417
aVduring the Troubles, 10 years ago,
p418
aVand I was working with some Catholic and Protestant kids
p419
aVon conflict resolution.
p420
aVAnd I did this with them \u2014
p421
aVa risky thing to do, because they were street kids.
p422
aVAnd one of them came to me the next morning
p423
aVand he said,
p424
aV"You know, I've never listened to classical music in my life,
p425
aVbut when you played that shopping piece ..."
p426
aa(lp427
V(Laughter)
p428
aa(lp429
VHe said, "My brother was shot last year and I didn't cry for him.
p430
aVBut last night, when you played that piece,
p431
aVhe was the one I was thinking about.
p432
aVAnd I felt the tears streaming down my face.
p433
aVAnd it felt really good to cry for my brother."
p434
aVSo I made up my mind at that moment
p435
aVthat classical music is for everybody.
p436
aVEverybody.
p437
aa(lp438
VNow, how would you walk \u2014
p439
aVmy profession, the music profession doesn't see it that way.
p440
aVThey say three percent of the population likes classical music.
p441
aVIf only we could move it to four percent, our problems would be over.
p442
aa(lp443
V(Laughter)
p444
aa(lp445
VHow would you walk? How would you talk? How would you be?
p446
aVIf you thought, "Three percent of the population likes classical music,
p447
aVif only we could move it to four percent."
p448
aVHow would you walk or talk? How would you be?
p449
aVIf you thought, "Everybody loves classical music \u2014
p450
aVthey just haven't found out about it yet."
p451
aVSee, these are totally different worlds.
p452
aa(lp453
VNow, I had an amazing experience.
p454
aVI was 45 years old,
p455
aVI'd been conducting for 20 years,
p456
aVand I suddenly had a realization.
p457
aVThe conductor of an orchestra doesn't make a sound.
p458
aVMy picture appears on the front of the CD \u2014
p459
aa(lp460
V(Laughter)
p461
aa(lp462
VBut the conductor doesn't make a sound.
p463
aVHe depends, for his power,
p464
aVon his ability to make other people powerful.
p465
aVAnd that changed everything for me.
p466
aVIt was totally life-changing.
p467
aVPeople in my orchestra said,
p468
aV"Ben, what happened?" That's what happened.
p469
aVI realized my job was to awaken possibility in other people.
p470
aVAnd of course, I wanted to know whether I was doing that.
p471
aVHow do you find out?
p472
aVYou look at their eyes.
p473
aVIf their eyes are shining, you know you're doing it.
p474
aVYou could light up a village with this guy's eyes.
p475
aa(lp476
V(Laughter)
p477
aa(lp478
VRight. So if the eyes are shining, you know you're doing it.
p479
aVIf the eyes are not shining, you get to ask a question.
p480
aVAnd this is the question:
p481
aVwho am I being
p482
aVthat my players' eyes are not shining?
p483
aVWe can do that with our children, too.
p484
aVWho am I being,
p485
aVthat my children's eyes are not shining?
p486
aVThat's a totally different world.
p487
aa(lp488
VNow, we're all about to end this magical, on-the-mountain week,
p489
aVwe're going back into the world.
p490
aVAnd I say, it's appropriate for us to ask the question,
p491
aVwho are we being as we go back out into the world?
p492
aVAnd you know, I have a definition of success.
p493
aVFor me, it's very simple.
p494
aVIt's not about wealth and fame and power.
p495
aVIt's about how many shining eyes I have around me.
p496
aa(lp497
VSo now, I have one last thought,
p498
aVwhich is that it really makes a difference what we say \u2014
p499
aVthe words that come out of our mouth.
p500
aVI learned this from a woman who survived Auschwitz,
p501
aVone of the rare survivors.
p502
aVShe went to Auschwitz when she was 15 years old.
p503
aVAnd ...
p504
aVAnd her brother was eight,
p505
aVand the parents were lost.
p506
aVAnd she told me this, she said,
p507
aV"We were in the train going to Auschwitz,
p508
aVand I looked down and saw my brother's shoes were missing.
p509
aVI said, 'Why are you so stupid, can't you keep your things together
p510
aVfor goodness' sake?'"
p511
aVThe way an elder sister might speak to a younger brother.
p512
aVUnfortunately, it was the last thing she ever said to him,
p513
aVbecause she never saw him again.
p514
aVHe did not survive.
p515
aVAnd so when she came out of Auschwitz, she made a vow.
p516
aVShe told me this.
p517
aVShe said, "I walked out of Auschwitz into life
p518
aVand I made a vow.
p519
aVAnd the vow was,
p520
aV"I will never say anything that couldn't stand as the last thing I ever say."
p521
aVNow, can we do that? No.
p522
aVAnd we'll make ourselves wrong and others wrong.
p523
aVBut it is a possibility to live into.
