VHi, my name is Marcin \u2014
p4
aVfarmer, technologist.
p5
aVI was born in Poland, now in the U.S.
p6
aVI started a group called Open Source Ecology.
p7
aVWe've identified the 50 most important machines
p8
aVthat we think it takes for modern life to exist \u2014
p9
aVthings from tractors,
p10
aVbread ovens, circuit makers.
p11
aVThen we set out to create
p12
aVan open source, DIY, do it yourself version
p13
aVthat anyone can build and maintain
p14
aVat a fraction of the cost.
p15
aVWe call this the Global Village Construction Set.
p16
aa(lp17
VSo let me tell you a story.
p18
aVSo I finished my 20s
p19
aVwith a Ph.D. in fusion energy,
p20
aVand I discovered I was useless.
p21
aVI had no practical skills.
p22
aVThe world presented me with options,
p23
aVand I took them.
p24
aVI guess you can call it the consumer lifestyle.
p25
aVSo I started a farm in Missouri
p26
aVand learned about the economics of farming.
p27
aVI bought a tractor \u2014 then it broke.
p28
aVI paid to get it repaired \u2014
p29
aVthen it broke again.
p30
aVThen pretty soon,
p31
aVI was broke too.
p32
aa(lp33
VI realized
p34
aVthat the truly appropriate, low-cost tools that I needed
p35
aVto start a sustainable farm and settlement
p36
aVjust didn't exist yet.
p37
aVI needed tools that were robust, modular,
p38
aVhighly efficient and optimized,
p39
aVlow-cost,
p40
aVmade from local and recycled materials that would last a lifetime,
p41
aVnot designed for obsolescence.
p42
aVI found that I would have to build them myself.
p43
aVSo I did just that.
p44
aVAnd I tested them.
p45
aVAnd I found that industrial productivity
p46
aVcan be achieved on a small scale.
p47
aa(lp48
VSo then I published the 3D designs,
p49
aVschematics,
p50
aVinstructional videos and budgets
p51
aVon a wiki.
p52
aVThen contributors from all over the world
p53
aVbegan showing up, prototyping new machines
p54
aVduring dedicated project visits.
p55
aVSo far, we have prototyped eight of the 50 machines.
p56
aVAnd now the project
p57
aVis beginning to grow on its own.
p58
aa(lp59
VWe know that open source has succeeded
p60
aVwith tools for managing knowledge and creativity.
p61
aVAnd the same is starting to happen with hardware too.
p62
aVWe're focusing on hardware
p63
aVbecause it is hardware that can change people's lives
p64
aVin such tangible material ways.
p65
aVIf we can lower the barriers to farming, building, manufacturing,
p66
aVthen we can unleash just massive amounts of human potential.
p67
aa(lp68
VThat's not only in the developing world.
p69
aVOur tools are being made
p70
aVfor the American farmer, builder, entrepreneur, maker.
p71
aVWe've seen lots of excitement from these people,
p72
aVwho can now start a construction business,
p73
aVparts manufacturing,
p74
aVorganic CSA
p75
aVor just selling power back to the grid.
p76
aVOur goal is a repository of published designs
p77
aVso clear, so complete,
p78
aVthat a single burned DVD
p79
aVis effectively a civilization starter kit.
p80
aa(lp81
VI've planted a hundred trees in a day.
p82
aVI've pressed 5,000 bricks in one day
p83
aVfrom the dirt beneath my feet
p84
aVand built a tractor in six days.
p85
aVFrom what I've seen, this is only the beginning.
p86
aa(lp87
VIf this idea is truly sound,
p88
aVthen the implications are significant.
p89
aVA greater distribution of the means of production,
p90
aVenvironmentally sound supply chains,
p91
aVand a newly relevant DIY maker culture
p92
aVcan hope to transcend
p93
aVartificial scarcity.
p94
aVWe're exploring the limits
p95
aVof what we all can do to make a better world
p96
aVwith open hardware technology.
p97
aa(lp98
VThank you.
