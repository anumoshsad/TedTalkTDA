VChris Anderson: Julian, welcome.
p4
aVIt's been reported that WikiLeaks, your baby,
p5
aVhas, in the last few years
p6
aVhas released more classified documents
p7
aVthan the rest of the world's media combined.
p8
aVCan that possibly be true?
p9
aa(lp10
VJulian Assange: Yeah, can it possibly be true?
p11
aVIt's a worry \u2014 isn't it? \u2014 that the rest of the world's media
p12
aVis doing such a bad job
p13
aVthat a little group of activists
p14
aVis able to release more
p15
aVof that type of information
p16
aVthan the rest of the world press combined.
p17
aa(lp18
VCA: How does it work?
p19
aVHow do people release the documents?
p20
aVAnd how do you secure their privacy?
p21
aa(lp22
VJA: So these are \u2014 as far as we can tell \u2014
p23
aVclassical whistleblowers,
p24
aVand we have a number of ways for them
p25
aVto get information to us.
p26
aVSo we use this state-of-the-art encryption
p27
aVto bounce stuff around the Internet, to hide trails,
p28
aVpass it through legal jurisdictions
p29
aVlike Sweden and Belgium
p30
aVto enact those legal protections.
p31
aVWe get information in the mail,
p32
aVthe regular postal mail,
p33
aVencrypted or not,
p34
aVvet it like a regular news organization, format it \u2014
p35
aVwhich is sometimes something that's quite hard to do,
p36
aVwhen you're talking about
p37
aVgiant databases of information \u2014
p38
aVrelease it to the public
p39
aVand then defend ourselves
p40
aVagainst the inevitable legal and political attacks.
p41
aa(lp42
VCA: So you make an effort to ensure
p43
aVthe documents are legitimate,
p44
aVbut you actually
p45
aValmost never know who the identity of the source is?
p46
aa(lp47
VJA: That's right, yeah. Very rarely do we ever know,
p48
aVand if we find out at some stage
p49
aVthen we destroy that information as soon as possible.
p50
aV(Phone ring) God damn it.
p51
aa(lp52
V(Laughter)
p53
aa(lp54
VCA: I think that's the CIA asking what the code is
p55
aVfor a TED membership.
p56
aa(lp57
V(Laughter)
p58
aa(lp59
VSo let's take [an] example, actually.
p60
aVThis is something
p61
aVyou leaked a few years ago.
p62
aVIf we can have this document up ...
p63
aVSo this was a story in Kenya a few years ago.
p64
aVCan you tell us what you leaked and what happened?
p65
aa(lp66
VJA: So this is the Kroll Report.
p67
aVThis was a secret intelligence report
p68
aVcommissioned by the Kenyan government
p69
aVafter its election in 2004.
p70
aVPrior to 2004, Kenya was ruled
p71
aVby Daniel arap Moi
p72
aVfor about 18 years.
p73
aVHe was a soft dictator of Kenya.
p74
aVAnd when Kibaki got into power \u2014
p75
aVthrough a coalition of forces that were trying
p76
aVto clean up corruption in Kenya \u2014
p77
aVthey commissioned this report,
p78
aVspent about two million pounds
p79
aVon this and an associated report.
p80
aVAnd then the government sat on it
p81
aVand used it for political leverage on Moi,
p82
aVwho was the richest man \u2014
p83
aVstill is the richest man \u2014 in Kenya.
p84
aVIt's the Holy Grail of Kenyan journalism.
p85
aVSo I went there in 2007,
p86
aVand we managed to get hold of this
p87
aVjust prior to the election \u2014
p88
aVthe national election, December 28.
p89
aVWhen we released that report,
p90
aVwe did so three days after the new president, Kibaki,
p91
aVhad decided to pal up with
p92
aVthe man that he was going to clean out,
p93
aVDaniel arap Moi,
p94
aVso this report then
p95
aVbecame a dead albatross
p96
aVaround President Kibaki's neck.
p97
aa(lp98
VCA: And \u2014 I mean, to cut a long story short \u2014
p99
aVword of the report leaked into Kenya,
p100
aVnot from the official media, but indirectly,
p101
aVand in your opinion, it actually shifted the election.
p102
aVJA: Yeah. So this became front page of the Guardian
p103
aVand was then printed in all the surrounding countries of Kenya,
p104
aVin Tanzanian and South African press.
p105
aVAnd so it came in from the outside.
p106
aVAnd that, after a couple of days,
p107
aVmade the Kenyan press feel safe to talk about it.
p108
aVAnd it ran for 20 nights straight on Kenyan TV,
p109
aVshifted the vote by 10 percent,
p110
aVaccording to a Kenyan intelligence report,
p111
aVwhich changed the result of the election.
p112
aa(lp113
VCA: Wow, so your leak
p114
aVreally substantially changed the world?
p115
aa(lp116
VJA: Yep.
p117
aa(lp118
V(Applause)
p119
aa(lp120
VCA: Here's \u2014 We're going to just show
p121
aVa short clip from this
p122
aVBaghdad airstrike video.
p123
aVThe video itself is longer,
p124
aVbut here's a short clip.
p125
aVThis is \u2014 this is intense material, I should warn you.
p126
aa(lp127
VRadio: ... just fuckin', once you get on 'em just open 'em up.
p128
aVI see your element, uh, got about four Humvees, uh, out along ...
p129
aVYou're clear. All right. Firing.
p130
aVLet me know when you've got them. Let's shoot.
p131
aVLight 'em all up.
p132
aVC'mon, fire!
p133
aV(Machine gun fire)
p134
aVKeep shoot 'n. Keep shoot 'n.
p135
aV(Machine gun fire)
p136
aVKeep shoot 'n.
p137
aVHotel ... Bushmaster Two-Six, Bushmaster Two-Six,
p138
aVwe need to move, time now!
p139
aVAll right, we just engaged all eight individuals.
p140
aVYeah, we see two birds [helicopters], and we're still firing.
p141
aVRoger. I got 'em.
p142
aVTwo-Six, this is Two-Six, we're mobile.
p143
aVOops, I'm sorry. What was going on?
p144
aVGod damn it, Kyle. All right, hahaha. I hit 'em.
p145
aa(lp146
VCA: So, what was the impact of that?
p147
aa(lp148
VJA: The impact on the people who worked on it
p149
aVwas severe.
p150
aVWe ended up sending two people to Baghdad
p151
aVto further research that story.
p152
aVSo this is just the first of three attacks
p153
aVthat occurred in that scene.
p154
aa(lp155
VCA: So, I mean, 11 people died in that attack, right,
p156
aVincluding two Reuters employees?
p157
aa(lp158
VJA: Yeah. Two Reuters employees,
p159
aVtwo young children were wounded.
p160
aVThere were between 18 and 26 people killed all together.
p161
aa(lp162
VCA: And releasing this caused
p163
aVwidespread outrage.
p164
aVWhat was the key element of this
p165
aVthat actually caused the outrage, do you think?
p166
aa(lp167
VJA: I don't know. I guess people can see
p168
aVthe gross disparity in force.
p169
aVYou have guys walking in a relaxed way down the street,
p170
aVand then an Apache helicopter sitting up at one kilometer
p171
aVfiring 30-millimeter cannon shells
p172
aVon everyone \u2014
p173
aVlooking for any excuse to do so \u2014
p174
aVand killing people rescuing the wounded.
p175
aVAnd there was two journalists involved that clearly weren't insurgents
p176
aVbecause that's their full-time job.
p177
aa(lp178
VCA: I mean, there's been this U.S. intelligence analyst,
p179
aVBradley Manning, arrested,
p180
aVand it's alleged that he confessed in a chat room
p181
aVto have leaked this video to you,
p182
aValong with 280,000
p183
aVclassified U.S. embassy cables.
p184
aVI mean, did he?
p185
aa(lp186
VJA: We have denied receiving those cables.
p187
aVHe has been charged,
p188
aVabout five days ago,
p189
aVwith obtaining 150,000 cables
p190
aVand releasing 50.
p191
aVNow, we had released,
p192
aVearly in the year,
p193
aVa cable from the Reykjavik U.S. embassy,
p194
aVbut this is not necessarily connected.
p195
aVI mean, I was a known visitor of that embassy.
p196
aa(lp197
VCA: I mean, if you did receive thousands
p198
aVof U.S. embassy diplomatic cables ...
p199
aa(lp200
VJA: We would have released them. (CA: You would?)
p201
aa(lp202
VJA: Yeah. (CA: Because?)
p203
aa(lp204
VJA: Well, because these sort of things
p205
aVreveal what the true state
p206
aVof, say,
p207
aVArab governments are like,
p208
aVthe true human-rights abuses in those governments.
p209
aVIf you look at declassified cables,
p210
aVthat's the sort of material that's there.
p211
aa(lp212
VCA: So let's talk a little more broadly about this.
p213
aVI mean, in general, what's your philosophy?
p214
aVWhy is it right
p215
aVto encourage leaking of secret information?
p216
aa(lp217
VJA: Well, there's a question as to what sort of information is important in the world,
p218
aVwhat sort of information
p219
aVcan achieve reform.
p220
aVAnd there's a lot of information.
p221
aVSo information that organizations
p222
aVare spending economic effort into concealing,
p223
aVthat's a really good signal
p224
aVthat when the information gets out,
p225
aVthere's a hope of it doing some good \u2014
p226
aVbecause the organizations that know it best,
p227
aVthat know it from the inside out,
p228
aVare spending work to conceal it.
p229
aVAnd that's what we've found in practice,
p230
aVand that's what the history of journalism is.
p231
aa(lp232
VCA: But are there risks with that,
p233
aVeither to the individuals concerned
p234
aVor indeed to society at large,
p235
aVwhere leaking can actually have
p236
aVan unintended consequence?
p237
aa(lp238
VJA: Not that we have seen with anything we have released.
p239
aVI mean, we have a harm immunization policy.
p240
aVWe have a way of dealing with information
p241
aVthat has sort of personal \u2014
p242
aVpersonally identifying information in it.
p243
aVBut there are legitimate secrets \u2014
p244
aVyou know, your records with your doctor;
p245
aVthat's a legitimate secret \u2014
p246
aVbut we deal with whistleblowers that are coming forward
p247
aVthat are really sort of well-motivated.
p248
aa(lp249
VCA: So they are well-motivated.
p250
aVAnd what would you say to, for example,
p251
aVthe, you know, the parent of someone
p252
aVwhose son is out serving the U.S. military,
p253
aVand he says, "You know what,
p254
aVyou've put up something that someone had an incentive to put out.
p255
aVIt shows a U.S. soldier laughing
p256
aVat people dying.
p257
aVThat gives the impression, has given the impression,
p258
aVto millions of people around the world
p259
aVthat U.S. soldiers are inhuman people.
p260
aVActually, they're not. My son isn't. How dare you?"
p261
aVWhat would you say to that?
p262
aa(lp263
VJA: Yeah, we do get a lot of that.
p264
aVBut remember, the people in Baghdad,
p265
aVthe people in Iraq, the people in Afghanistan \u2014
p266
aVthey don't need to see the video;
p267
aVthey see it every day.
p268
aVSo it's not going to change their opinion. It's not going to change their perception.
p269
aVThat's what they see every day.
p270
aVIt will change the perception and opinion
p271
aVof the people who are paying for it all,
p272
aVand that's our hope.
p273
aa(lp274
VCA: So you found a way to shine light
p275
aVinto what you see
p276
aVas these sort of dark secrets in companies and in government.
p277
aVLight is good.
p278
aVBut do you see any irony in the fact that,
p279
aVin order for you to shine that light,
p280
aVyou have to, yourself,
p281
aVcreate secrecy around your sources?
p282
aa(lp283
VJA: Not really. I mean, we don't have
p284
aVany WikiLeaks dissidents yet.
p285
aVWe don't have sources who are dissidents on other sources.
p286
aVShould they come forward, that would be a tricky situation for us,
p287
aVbut we're presumably acting in such a way
p288
aVthat people feel
p289
aVmorally compelled
p290
aVto continue our mission, not to screw it up.
p291
aa(lp292
VCA: I'd actually be interested, just based on what we've heard so far \u2014
p293
aVI'm curious as to the opinion in the TED audience.
p294
aVYou know, there might be a couple of views
p295
aVof WikiLeaks and of Julian.
p296
aVYou know, hero \u2014 people's hero \u2014
p297
aVbringing this important light.
p298
aVDangerous troublemaker.
p299
aVWho's got the hero view?
p300
aVWho's got the dangerous troublemaker view?
p301
aa(lp302
VJA: Oh, come on. There must be some.
p303
aa(lp304
VCA: It's a soft crowd, Julian, a soft crowd.
p305
aVWe have to try better. Let's show them another example.
p306
aVNow here's something that you haven't yet leaked,
p307
aVbut I think for TED you are.
p308
aVI mean it's an intriguing story that's just happened, right?
p309
aVWhat is this?
p310
aa(lp311
VJA: So this is a sample of what we do
p312
aVsort of every day.
p313
aVSo late last year \u2014 in November last year \u2014
p314
aVthere was a series of well blowouts
p315
aVin Albania,
p316
aVlike the well blowout in the Gulf of Mexico,
p317
aVbut not quite as big.
p318
aVAnd we got a report \u2014
p319
aVa sort of engineering analysis into what happened \u2014
p320
aVsaying that, in fact, security guards
p321
aVfrom some rival, various competing oil firms
p322
aVhad, in fact, parked trucks there and blown them up.
p323
aVAnd part of the Albanian government was in this, etc., etc.
p324
aVAnd the engineering report
p325
aVhad nothing on the top of it,
p326
aVso it was an extremely difficult document for us.
p327
aVWe couldn't verify it because we didn't know
p328
aVwho wrote it and knew what it was about.
p329
aVSo we were kind of skeptical that maybe it was
p330
aVa competing oil firm just sort of playing the issue up.
p331
aVSo under that basis, we put it out and said,
p332
aV"Look, we're skeptical about this thing.
p333
aVWe don't know, but what can we do?
p334
aVThe material looks good, it feels right,
p335
aVbut we just can't verify it."
p336
aVAnd we then got a letter
p337
aVjust this week
p338
aVfrom the company who wrote it,
p339
aVwanting to track down the source \u2014
p340
aV(Laughter)
p341
aVsaying, "Hey, we want to track down the source."
p342
aVAnd we were like, "Oh, tell us more.
p343
aVWhat document is it, precisely, you're talking about?
p344
aVCan you show that you had legal authority over that document?
p345
aVIs it really yours?"
p346
aVSo they sent us this screen shot
p347
aVwith the author
p348
aVin the Microsoft Word ID.
p349
aVYeah.
p350
aV(Applause)
p351
aVThat's happened quite a lot though.
p352
aVThis is like one of our methods
p353
aVof identifying, of verifying, what a material is,
p354
aVis to try and get these guys to write letters.
p355
aa(lp356
VCA: Yeah. Have you had information
p357
aVfrom inside BP?
p358
aa(lp359
VJA: Yeah, we have a lot, but I mean, at the moment,
p360
aVwe are undergoing a sort of serious fundraising and engineering effort.
p361
aVSo our publication rate
p362
aVover the past few months
p363
aVhas been sort of minimized
p364
aVwhile we're re-engineering our back systems
p365
aVfor the phenomenal public interest that we have.
p366
aVThat's a problem.
p367
aVI mean, like any sort of growing startup organization,
p368
aVwe are sort of overwhelmed
p369
aVby our growth,
p370
aVand that means we're getting enormous quantity
p371
aVof whistleblower disclosures
p372
aVof a very high caliber
p373
aVbut don't have enough people to actually
p374
aVprocess and vet this information.
p375
aa(lp376
VCA: So that's the key bottleneck,
p377
aVbasically journalistic volunteers
p378
aVand/or the funding of journalistic salaries?
p379
aa(lp380
VJA: Yep. Yeah, and trusted people.
p381
aVI mean, we're an organization
p382
aVthat is hard to grow very quickly
p383
aVbecause of the sort of material we deal with,
p384
aVso we have to restructure
p385
aVin order to have people
p386
aVwho will deal with the highest national security stuff,
p387
aVand then lower security cases.
p388
aa(lp389
VCA: So help us understand a bit about you personally
p390
aVand how you came to do this.
p391
aVAnd I think I read that as a kid
p392
aVyou went to 37 different schools.
p393
aVCan that be right?
p394
aa(lp395
VJA: Well, my parents were in the movie business
p396
aVand then on the run from a cult,
p397
aVso the combination between the two ...
p398
aa(lp399
V(Laughter)
p400
aa(lp401
VCA: I mean, a psychologist might say
p402
aVthat's a recipe for breeding paranoia.
p403
aa(lp404
VJA: What, the movie business?
p405
aa(lp406
V(Laughter)
p407
aa(lp408
V(Applause)
p409
aa(lp410
VCA: And you were also \u2014 I mean,
p411
aVyou were also a hacker at an early age
p412
aVand ran into the authorities early on.
p413
aVJA: Well, I was a journalist.
p414
aVYou know, I was a very young journalist activist at an early age.
p415
aVI wrote a magazine,
p416
aVwas prosecuted for it when I was a teenager.
p417
aVSo you have to be careful with hacker.
p418
aVI mean there's like \u2014 there's a method
p419
aVthat can be deployed for various things.
p420
aVUnfortunately, at the moment,
p421
aVit's mostly deployed by the Russian mafia
p422
aVin order to steal your grandmother's bank accounts.
p423
aVSo this phrase is not,
p424
aVnot as nice as it used to be.
p425
aa(lp426
VCA: Yeah, well, I certainly don't think
p427
aVyou're stealing anyone's grandmother's bank account,
p428
aVbut what about
p429
aVyour core values?
p430
aVCan you give us a sense of what they are
p431
aVand maybe some incident in your life
p432
aVthat helped determine them?
p433
aa(lp434
VJA: I'm not sure about the incident.
p435
aVBut the core values:
p436
aVwell, capable, generous men
p437
aVdo not create victims;
p438
aVthey nurture victims.
p439
aVAnd that's something from my father
p440
aVand something from other capable, generous men
p441
aVthat have been in my life.
p442
aa(lp443
VCA: Capable, generous men do not create victims;
p444
aVthey nurture victims?
p445
aa(lp446
VJA: Yeah. And you know,
p447
aVI'm a combative person,
p448
aVso I'm not actually so big on the nurture,
p449
aVbut some way \u2014
p450
aVthere is another way of nurturing victims,
p451
aVwhich is to police perpetrators
p452
aVof crime.
p453
aVAnd so that is something
p454
aVthat has been in my character
p455
aVfor a long time.
p456
aa(lp457
VCA: So just tell us, very quickly in the last minute, the story:
p458
aVwhat happened in Iceland?
p459
aVYou basically published something there,
p460
aVran into trouble with a bank,
p461
aVthen the news service there
p462
aVwas injuncted from running the story.
p463
aVInstead, they publicized your side.
p464
aVThat made you very high-profile in Iceland. What happened next?
p465
aa(lp466
VJA: Yeah, this is a great case, you know.
p467
aVIceland went through this financial crisis.
p468
aVIt was the hardest hit of any country in the world.
p469
aVIts banking sector was 10 times the GDP
p470
aVof the rest of the economy.
p471
aVAnyway, so we release this report
p472
aVin July last year.
p473
aVAnd the national TV station was injuncted
p474
aVfive minutes before it went on air,
p475
aVlike out of a movie: injunction landed on the news desk,
p476
aVand the news reader was like,
p477
aV"This has never happened before. What do we do?"
p478
aVWell, we just show the website instead,
p479
aVfor all that time, as a filler,
p480
aVand we became very famous in Iceland,
p481
aVwent to Iceland and spoke about this issue.
p482
aVAnd there was a feeling in the community
p483
aVthat that should never happen again,
p484
aVand as a result,
p485
aVworking with Icelandic politicians
p486
aVand some other international legal experts,
p487
aVwe put together a new sort of
p488
aVpackage of legislation for Iceland
p489
aVto sort of become an offshore haven
p490
aVfor the free press,
p491
aVwith the strongest journalistic protections in the world,
p492
aVwith a new Nobel Prize
p493
aVfor freedom of speech.
p494
aVIceland's a Nordic country,
p495
aVso, like Norway, it's able to tap into the system.
p496
aVAnd just a month ago,
p497
aVthis was passed by the Icelandic parliament unanimously.

aVBig Brother exerting more control,
p507
aVmore secrecy,
p508
aVor us watching
p509
aVBig Brother,
p510
aVor it's just all to be played for either way?
p511
aa(lp512
VJA: I'm not sure which way it's going to go.
p513
aVI mean, there's enormous pressures
p514
aVto harmonize freedom of speech legislation
p515
aVand transparency legislation around the world \u2014
p516
aVwithin the E.U.,
p517
aVbetween China and the United States.
p518
aVWhich way is it going to go? It's hard to see.
p519
aVThat's why it's a very interesting time to be in \u2014
p520
aVbecause with just a little bit of effort,
p521
aVwe can shift it one way or the other.
