VAs a magician, I try to create images that make people stop and think.
p4
aVI also try to challenge myself
p5
aVto do things that doctors say are not possible.
p6
aVI was buried alive in New York City in a coffin,
p7
aVburied alive in a coffin in April, 1999, for a week.
p8
aVI lived there with nothing but water.
p9
aVAnd it ended up being so much fun
p10
aVthat I decided I could pursue doing more of these things.
p11
aVThe next one is I froze myself in a block of ice
p12
aVfor three days and three nights in New York City.
p13
aVThat one was way more difficult than I had expected.
p14
aVThe one after that, I stood on top of a hundred-foot pillar
p15
aVfor 36 hours.
p16
aVI began to hallucinate so hard
p17
aVthat the buildings that were behind me started to look like big animal heads.
p18
aa(lp19
VSo, next I went to London.
p20
aVIn London I lived in a glass box for 44 days
p21
aVwith nothing but water.
p22
aVIt was, for me, one of the most difficult things I'd ever done,
p23
aVbut it was also the most beautiful.
p24
aVThere was so many skeptics, especially the press in London,
p25
aVthat they started flying cheeseburgers on helicopters around my box to tempt me.
p26
aa(lp27
V(Laughter)
p28
aa(lp29
VSo, I felt very validated
p30
aVwhen the New England Journal of Medicine actually used the research for science.
p31
aa(lp32
VMy next pursuit was I wanted to see how long I could go without breathing,
p33
aVlike how long I could survive with nothing, not even air.
p34
aVI didn't realize that it would become the most amazing journey of my life.
p35
aa(lp36
VAs a young magician,
p37
aVI was obsessed with Houdini and his underwater challenges.
p38
aVSo, I began, early on, competing against the other kids,
p39
aVseeing how long I could stay underwater while they went up and down to breathe,
p40
aVyou know, five times, while I stayed under on one breath.
p41
aVBy the time I was a teenager,
p42
aVI was able to hold my breath for three minutes and 30 seconds.
p43
aVI would later find out that was Houdini's personal record.
p44
aa(lp45
VIn 1987 I heard of a story
p46
aVabout a boy that fell through ice and was trapped under a river.
p47
aVHe was underneath, not breathing for 45 minutes.
p48
aVWhen the rescue workers came,
p49
aVthey resuscitated him and there was no brain damage.
p50
aVHis core temperature had dropped to 77 degrees.
p51
aVAs a magician, I think everything is possible.
p52
aVAnd I think if something is done by one person,
p53
aVit can be done by others.
p54
aVI started to think,
p55
aVif the boy could survive without breathing for that long,
p56
aVthere must be a way that I could do it.
p57
aa(lp58
VSo, I met with a top neurosurgeon.
p59
aVAnd I asked him, how long is it possible to go without breathing,
p60
aVlike how long could I go without air?
p61
aVAnd he said to me that anything over six minutes
p62
aVyou have a serious risk of hypoxic brain damage.
p63
aVSo, I took that as a challenge, basically.
p64
aa(lp65
V(Laughter)
p66
aa(lp67
VMy first try, I figured that I could do something similar,
p68
aVand I created a water tank,
p69
aVand I filled it with ice and freezing cold water.
p70
aVAnd I stayed inside of that water tank
p71
aVhoping my core temperature would start to drop.
p72
aVAnd I was shivering.
p73
aVIn my first attempt to hold my breath, I couldn't even last a minute.
p74
aVSo, I realized that was completely not going to work.
p75
aa(lp76
VI went to talk to a doctor friend \u2014
p77
aVand I asked him, "How could I do that?"
p78
aV"I want to hold my breath for a really long time. How could it be done?"
p79
aVAnd he said, "David, you're a magician,
p80
aVcreate the illusion of not breathing, it will be much easier."
p81
aa(lp82
V(Laughter)
p83
aa(lp84
VSo, he came up with this idea of creating a rebreather,
p85
aVwith a CO2 scrubber,
p86
aVwhich was basically a tube from Home Depot,
p87
aVwith a balloon duct-taped to it,
p88
aVthat he thought we could put inside of me,
p89
aVand somehow be able to circulate the air and rebreathe
p90
aVwith this thing in me.
p91
aVThis is a little hard to watch.
p92
aVBut this is that attempt.
p93
aVSo, that clearly wasn't going to work.
p94
aa(lp95
V(Laughter)
p96
aa(lp97
VThen I actually started thinking about liquid breathing.
p98
aVThere is a chemical that's called perflubron.
p99
aVAnd it's so high in oxygen levels that in theory you could breathe it.
p100
aVSo, I got my hands on that chemical,
p101
aVfilled the sink up with it, and stuck my face in the sink
p102
aVand tried to breathe that in, which was really impossible.
p103
aVIt's basically like trying to breathe, as a doctor said,
p104
aVwhile having an elephant standing on your chest.
p105
aVSo, that idea disappeared.
p106
aa(lp107
VThen I started thinking,
p108
aVwould it be possible to hook up a heart/lung bypass machine
p109
aVand have a surgery where it was a tube going into my artery,
p110
aVand then appear to not breathe while they were oxygenating my blood?
p111
aVWhich was another insane idea, obviously.
p112
aa(lp113
VThen I thought about the craziest idea of all the ideas:
p114
aVto actually do it.
p115
aa(lp116
V(Laughter)
p117
aa(lp118
VTo actually try to hold my breath past the point
p119
aVthat doctors would consider you brain dead.
p120
aVSo, I started researching into pearl divers.
p121
aVYou know, because they go down for four minutes on one breath.
p122
aVAnd when I was researching pearl divers, I found the world of free-diving.
p123
aVIt was the most amazing thing that I ever discovered, pretty much.
p124
aVThere is many different aspects to free-diving.
p125
aVThere is depth records, where people go as deep as they can.
p126
aVAnd then there is static apnea.
p127
aVThat's holding your breath as long as you can
p128
aVin one place without moving.
p129
aVThat was the one that I studied.
p130
aa(lp131
VThe first thing that I learned is when you're holding your breath,
p132
aVyou should never move at all; that wastes energy.
p133
aVAnd that depletes oxygen,
p134
aVand it builds up CO2 in your blood.
p135
aVSo, I learned never to move.
p136
aVAnd I learned how to slow my heart rate down.
p137
aVI had to remain perfectly still and just relax
p138
aVand think that I wasn't in my body, and just control that.
p139
aVAnd then I learned how to purge.
p140
aVPurging is basically hyperventilating.
p141
aVYou blow in and out \u2014
p142
aa(lp143
V(Breathing loudly)
p144
aa(lp145
VYou do that, you get lightheaded, you get tingling.
p146
aVAnd you're really ridding your body of CO2.
p147
aVSo, when you hold your breath, it's infinitely easier.
p148
aVThen I learned that you have to take a huge breath,
p149
aVand just hold and relax and never let any air out,
p150
aVand just hold and relax through all the pain.
p151
aa(lp152
VEvery morning, this is for months,
p153
aVI would wake up and the first thing that I would do
p154
aVis I would hold my breath
p155
aVfor, out of 52 minutes, I would hold my breath for 44 minutes.
p156
aVSo, basically what that means is I would purge,
p157
aVI'd breathe really hard for a minute.
p158
aVAnd I would hold, immediately after, for five and a half minutes.
p159
aVThen I would breathe again for a minute, purging as hard as I can,
p160
aVthen immediately after that I would hold again for five and a half minutes.
p161
aVI would repeat this process eight times in a row.
p162
aVOut of 52 minutes, you're only breathing for eight minutes.
p163
aVAt the end of that you're completely fried, your brain.
p164
aVYou feel like you're walking around in a daze.
p165
aVAnd you have these awful headaches.
p166
aVBasically, I'm not the best person to talk to when I'm doing that stuff.
p167
aa(lp168
VI started learning about the world-record holder.
p169
aVHis name is Tom Sietas.
p170
aVAnd this guy is perfectly built for holding his breath.
p171
aVHe's six foot four. He's 160 pounds.
p172
aVAnd his total lung capacity is twice the size of an average person.
p173
aVI'm six foot one, and fat.
p174
aVWe'll say big-boned.
p175
aa(lp176
V(Laughter)
p177
aa(lp178
VI had to drop 50 pounds in three months.
p179
aVSo, everything that I put into my body, I considered as medicine.
p180
aVEvery bit of food was exactly what it was for its nutritional value.
p181
aVI ate really small controlled portions throughout the day.
p182
aVAnd I started to really adapt my body.
p183
aa(lp184
V[Individual results may vary]
p185
aa(lp186
V(Laughter)
p187
aa(lp188
VThe thinner I was, the longer I was able to hold my breath.
p189
aVAnd by eating so well and training so hard,
p190
aVmy resting heart-rate dropped to 38 beats per minute.
p191
aVWhich is lower than most Olympic athletes.
p192
aVIn four months of training,
p193
aVI was able to hold my breath for over seven minutes.
p194
aVI wanted to try holding my breath everywhere.
p195
aVI wanted to try it in the most extreme situations
p196
aVto see if I could slow my heart rate down under duress.
p197
aa(lp198
V(Laughter)
p199
aa(lp200
VI decided that I was going to break the world record
p201
aVlive on prime-time television.
p202
aVThe world record was eight minutes and 58 seconds,
p203
aVheld by Tom Sietas, that guy with the whale lungs I told you about.
p204
aVI assumed that I could put a water tank at Lincoln Center
p205
aVand if I stayed there a week not eating,
p206
aVI would get comfortable in that situation and I would slow my metabolism,
p207
aVwhich I was sure would help me hold my breath
p208
aVlonger than I had been able to do it.
p209
aVI was completely wrong.
p210
aa(lp211
VI entered the sphere a week before the scheduled air date.
p212
aVAnd I thought everything seemed to be on track.
p213
aVTwo days before my big breath-hold attempt, for the record,
p214
aVthe producers of my television special
p215
aVthought that just watching somebody holding their breath, and almost drowning,
p216
aVis too boring for television.
p217
aa(lp218
V(Laughter)
p219
aa(lp220
VSo, I had to add handcuffs, while holding my breath, to escape from.
p221
aVThis was a critical mistake.
p222
aVBecause of the movement, I was wasting oxygen.
p223
aVAnd by seven minutes I had gone into these awful convulsions.
p224
aVBy 7:08, I started to black out.
p225
aVAnd by seven minutes and 30 seconds,
p226
aVthey had to pull my body out and bring me back.
p227
aVI had failed on every level.
p228
aa(lp229
V(Laughter)
p230
aa(lp231
VSo, naturally, the only way out of the slump that I could think of was,
p232
aVI decided to call Oprah.
p233
aa(lp234
V(Laughter)
p235
aa(lp236
VI told her that I wanted to up the ante
p237
aVand hold my breath longer than any human being ever had.
p238
aVThis was a different record.
p239
aVThis was a pure O2 static apnea record
p240
aVthat Guinness had set the world record at 13 minutes.
p241
aVSo, basically you breathe pure O2 first, oxygenating your body, flushing out CO2,
p242
aVand you are able to hold much longer.
p243
aVI realized that my real competition was the beaver.
p244
aa(lp245
V(Laughter)
p246
aa(lp247
V(Laughter ends)
p248
aa(lp249
VIn January of '08,
p250
aVOprah gave me four months to prepare and train.
p251
aVSo, I would sleep in a hypoxic tent every night.
p252
aVA hypoxic tent is a tent that simulates altitude at 15,000 feet.
p253
aVSo, it's like base camp, Everest.
p254
aVWhat that does is, you start building up the red bloodcell count in your body,
p255
aVwhich helps you carry oxygen better.
p256
aVEvery morning, again, after getting out of that tent,
p257
aVyour brain is completely wiped out.
p258
aVMy first attempt on pure O2, I was able to go up to 15 minutes.
p259
aVSo, it was a pretty big success.
p260
aa(lp261
VThe neurosurgeon pulled me out of the water
p262
aVbecause in his mind, at 15 minutes your brain is done, you're brain dead.
p263
aVSo, he pulled me up, and I was fine.
p264
aVThere was one person there that was definitely not impressed.
p265
aVIt was my ex-girlfriend.
p266
aVWhile I was breaking the record underwater for the first time,
p267
aVshe was sifting through my Blackberry, checking all my messages.
p268
aa(lp269
V(Laughter)
p270
aa(lp271
VMy brother had a picture of it. It is really \u2014
p272
aa(lp273
V(Laughter)
p274
aa(lp275
V(Laughter ends)
p276
aa(lp277
VI then announced that I was going to go for Sietas' record, publicly.
p278
aVAnd what he did in response, is he went on Regis and Kelly,
p279
aVand broke his old record.
p280
aVThen his main competitor went out and broke his record.
p281
aVSo, he suddenly pushed the record up to 16 minutes and 32 seconds.
p282
aVWhich was three minutes longer than I had prepared.
p283
aVIt was longer than the record.
p284
aa(lp285
VI wanted to get the Science Times to document this.
p286
aVI wanted to get them to do a piece on it.
p287
aVSo, I did what any person
p288
aVseriously pursuing scientific advancement would do.
p289
aVI walked into the New York Times offices and did card tricks to everybody.
p290
aa(lp291
V(Laughter)
p292
aa(lp293
VSo, I don't know if it was the magic or the lure of the Cayman Islands,
p294
aVbut John Tierney flew down
p295
aVand did a piece on the seriousness of breath-holding.
p296
aa(lp297
VWhile he was there, I tried to impress him, of course.
p298
aVAnd I did a dive down to 160 feet,
p299
aVwhich is basically the height of a 16 story building,
p300
aVand as I was coming up, I blacked out underwater,
p301
aVwhich is really dangerous; that's how you drown.
p302
aVLuckily, Kirk had seen me and he swam over and pulled me up.
p303
aa(lp304
VSo, I started full focus.
p305
aVI completely trained to get my breath-hold time up
p306
aVfor what I needed to do.
p307
aVBut there was no way to prepare for the live television aspect of it,
p308
aVbeing on Oprah.
p309
aVBut in practice, I would do it face down, floating on the pool.
p310
aVBut for TV they wanted me to be upright so they could see my face, basically.
p311
aVThe other problem was the suit was so buoyant
p312
aVthat they had to strap my feet in to keep me from floating up.
p313
aVSo, I had to use my legs to hold my feet into the straps that were loose,
p314
aVwhich was a real problem for me.
p315
aVThat made me extremely nervous, raising the heart rate.
p316
aa(lp317
VThen, what they also did was,
p318
aVwhich we never did before, is there was a heart-rate monitor.
p319
aVAnd it was right next to the sphere.
p320
aVSo, every time my heart would beat, I'd hear the beep-beep-beep-beep,
p321
aVyou know, the ticking, really loud.
p322
aVWhich was making me more nervous.
p323
aVAnd there was no way to slow my heart rate down.
p324
aVNormally, I would start at 38 beats per minute,
p325
aVand while holding my breath, it would drop to 12 beats per minute,
p326
aVwhich is pretty unusual.
p327
aa(lp328
V(Laughter)
p329
aa(lp330
VThis time it started at 120 beats, and it never went down.
p331
aVI spent the first five minutes underwater
p332
aVdesperately trying to slow my heart rate down.
p333
aVI was just sitting there thinking,
p334
aV"I've got to slow this down. I'm going to fail."
p335
aVAnd I was getting more nervous.
p336
aVAnd the heart rate just kept going up and up,
p337
aVall the way up to 150 beats.
p338
aVBasically it's the same thing that created my downfall at Lincoln Center.
p339
aVIt was a waste of O2.
p340
aVWhen I made it to the halfway mark, at eight minutes,
p341
aVI was 100 percent certain
p342
aVthat I was not going to be able to make this.
p343
aVThere was no way for me to do it.
p344
aa(lp345
VI figured, Oprah had dedicated an hour
p346
aVto doing this breath-hold thing, if I had cracked early,
p347
aVit would be a whole show about how depressed I am.
p348
aa(lp349
V(Laughter)
p350
aa(lp351
VSo, I figured I'm better off just fighting and staying there until I black out,
p352
aVat least then they can pull me out and take care of me and all that.
p353
aa(lp354
V(Laughter)
p355
aa(lp356
VI kept pushing to 10 minutes.
p357
aVAt 10 minutes you start getting all these really strong tingling sensations
p358
aVin your fingers and toes.
p359
aVAnd I knew that that was blood shunting,
p360
aVwhen the blood rushes away from your extremities
p361
aVto provide oxygen to your vital organs.
p362
aVAt 11 minutes I started feeling throbbing sensations in my legs,
p363
aVand my lips started to feel really strange.
p364
aa(lp365
VAt minute 12 I started to have ringing in my ears,
p366
aVand I started to feel my arm going numb.
p367
aVAnd I'm a hypochondriac, and I remember arm numb means heart attack.
p368
aVSo, I started to really get really paranoid.
p369
aVThen at 13 minutes, maybe because of the hypochondria,
p370
aVI started feeling pains all over my chest.
p371
aVIt was awful.
p372
aa(lp373
V(Laughter)
p374
aa(lp375
VAt 14 minutes, I had these awful contractions,
p376
aVlike this urge to breathe.
p377
aa(lp378
V(Laughter)
p379
aa(lp380
V(Laughter ends)
p381
aa(lp382
VAt 15 minutes I was suffering major O2 deprivation to the heart.
p383
aVAnd I started having ischemia to the heart.
p384
aVMy heartbeat would go from 120 to 50,
p385
aVto 150, to 40, to 20, to 150 again.
p386
aVIt would skip a beat.
p387
aVIt would start. It would stop. And I felt all this.
p388
aVAnd I was sure that I was going to have a heart attack.
p389
aa(lp390
VSo, at 16 minutes what I did is I slid my feet out
p391
aVbecause I knew that if I did go out, if I did have a heart attack,
p392
aVthey'd have to jump into the binding and take my feet out
p393
aVbefore pulling me up.
p394
aVI was really nervous.
p395
aVI let my feet out, and I started floating to the top.
p396
aVAnd I didn't take my head out.
p397
aVBut I was just floating there waiting for my heart to stop,
p398
aVjust waiting.
p399
aa(lp400
VThey had doctors with the "Pst," you know, sitting there waiting.
p401
aVAnd then suddenly I hear screaming.
p402
aVAnd I think that there is some weird thing \u2014
p403
aVthat I had died or something had happened.
p404
aVAnd then I realized that I had made it to 16:32.
p405
aVSo, with the energy of everybody that was there,
p406
aVI decided to keep pushing.
p407
aVAnd I went to 17 minutes and four seconds.
p408
aa(lp409
V(Applause)
p410
aa(lp411
V(Applause ends)
p412
aa(lp413
VAs though that wasn't enough, what I did immediately after
p414
aVis I went to Quest Labs
p415
aVand had them take every blood sample that they could
p416
aVto test for everything and to see where my levels were,
p417
aVso the doctors could use it, once again.
p418
aVI also didn't want anybody to question it.
p419
aVI had the world record and I wanted to make sure it was legitimate.
p420
aa(lp421
VSo, I get to New York City the next day,
p422
aVI'm walking out of the Apple store,
p423
aVand this kid walks up to me he's like, "Yo, D!"
p424
aVI'm like "Yeah?"
p425
aVHe said, "If you really held your breath that long,
p426
aVwhy'd you come out of the water dry?"
p427
aVI was like "What?"
p428
aa(lp429
V(Laughter)
p430
aa(lp431
VAnd that's my life. So \u2014
p432
aa(lp433
V(Laughter)
p434
aa(lp435
VAs a magician, I try to show things to people
p436
aVthat seem impossible.
p437
aVAnd I think magic,
p438
aVwhether I'm holding my breath or shuffling a deck of cards,
p439
aVis pretty simple.
p440
aVIt's practice, it's training, and it's \u2014 (Sobs)
p441
aVIt's practice, it's training and experimenting,
p442
aa(lp443
V(Sobs)
p444
aa(lp445
Vwhile pushing through the pain to be the best that I can be.
p446
aVAnd that's what magic is to me, so, thank you.
