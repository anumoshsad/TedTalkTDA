VIn 2007,
p4
aVI decided that we needed to reconceptualize
p5
aVhow we thought about economic development.
p6
aVOur new goal should be
p7
aVthat when every family thinks about where they want to live and work,
p8
aVthey should be able to choose between
p9
aVat least a handful
p10
aVof different cities
p11
aVthat were all competing to attract new residents.
p12
aVNow we're a long way away from that goal right now.
p13
aVThere are billions of people in developing countries
p14
aVwho don't have even a single city that would be willing to welcome them.
p15
aVBut the amazing thing about cities
p16
aVis they're worth so much more
p17
aVthan it costs to build them.
p18
aVSo we could easily supply the world
p19
aVwith dozens, maybe hundreds,
p20
aVof new cities.
p21
aa(lp22
VNow this might sound preposterous to you
p23
aVif you've never thought about new cities.
p24
aVBut just substitute apartment building for cities.
p25
aVImagine half the people who wanted to be in apartments already had them;
p26
aVthe other half aren't there yet.
p27
aVYou could try and expand the capacity
p28
aVby doing additions on all the existing apartments.
p29
aVBut you know what you'd run into
p30
aVis those apartments and the surrounding areas
p31
aVhave rules to avoid discomfort
p32
aVand the distractions of construction.
p33
aVSo it's extremely hard to do all of those additions.
p34
aVBut you could go out someplace brand new,
p35
aVbuild a brand new apartment building,
p36
aVas long as the rules there
p37
aVwere ones that facilitated construction
p38
aVrather than getting in the way.
p39
aVSo I proposed
p40
aVthat governments create new reform zones
p41
aVbig enough to hold cities
p42
aVand gave them a name: charter cities.
p43
aa(lp44
VLater I learned that at about this same time,
p45
aVJavier and Octavio
p46
aVwere thinking about the challenge of reform
p47
aVin Honduras.
p48
aVThey knew that about 75,000 Hondurans every year
p49
aVwould leave to go to the United States,
p50
aVand they wanted to ask, what could they do
p51
aVto make sure that those people could stay
p52
aVand do the same things in Honduras.
p53
aVAt one point, Javier said to Octavio,
p54
aV"What if we took some of our empty land \u2014
p55
aVwhat if we just gave it to an embassy \u2014
p56
aVgive some to the U.S. embassy; give some to the Canadian embassy \u2014
p57
aVand then if people want to go work
p58
aVunder the rules of Canada or under the rules of the United States,
p59
aVthey can go get jobs,
p60
aVdo everything they do on those embassy grounds
p61
aVthat they would otherwise have to go to Canada or the U.S. to do?"
p62
aa(lp63
VIn the summer of 2009,
p64
aVHonduras went through a wrenching constitutional crisis.
p65
aVAt the next regularly scheduled election,
p66
aVPepe Lobo won in a landslide
p67
aVon a platform that promised reform,
p68
aVbut reconciliation as well.
p69
aVHe asked Octavio to be his chief of staff.
p70
aVMeanwhile, I was getting ready
p71
aVto give a talk at TEDGlobal.
p72
aVThrough a process of refinement,
p73
aVtrial and error, a lot of user testing,
p74
aVI tried to boil this complicated concept of charter city
p75
aVdown to the bare essentials.
p76
aVThe first point was the importance of rules,
p77
aVlike those rules that say
p78
aVyou can't come in and disturb all the existing apartment holders.
p79
aVWe pay a lot of attention to new technologies,
p80
aVbut it takes technologies and rules to get progress,
p81
aVand it's usually the rules that hold us back.
p82
aa(lp83
VIn the fall of 2010, a friend from Guatemala
p84
aVsent Octavio a link to the TEDTalk.
p85
aVHe showed it to Javier.
p86
aVThey called me.
p87
aVThey said, "Let's present this to the leaders of our country."
p88
aVSo in December we met in Miami,
p89
aVin a hotel conference room.
p90
aVI tried to explain this point
p91
aVabout how valuable cities are,
p92
aVhow much more valuable they are than they cost.
p93
aVAnd I used this slide
p94
aVshowing how valuable the raw land is
p95
aVin a place like New York City:
p96
aVnotice, land that's worth thousands of dollars, in some cases,
p97
aVper square meter.
p98
aVBut it was a fairly abstract discussion,
p99
aVand at some point when there was a pause,
p100
aVOctavio said,
p101
aV"Paul, maybe we could watch the TEDTalk."
p102
aa(lp103
V(Laughing)
p104
aa(lp105
VSo the TEDTalk laid out in very simple terms,
p106
aVa charter city is a place
p107
aVwhere you start with uninhabited land,
p108
aVa charter that specifies the rules that will apply there
p109
aVand then a chance for people to opt in,
p110
aVto go live under those rules or not.
p111
aVSo I was asked by the president of Honduras
p112
aVwho said that we need to do this project,
p113
aVthis is important,
p114
aVthis could be the way forward for our country.
p115
aVI was asked to come to Tegucigalpa
p116
aVand talk again on January fourth and fifth.
p117
aVSo I presented
p118
aVanother fact-filled lecture
p119
aVthat included a slide like this,
p120
aVwhich tried to make the point that, if you want to create a lot of value in a city,
p121
aVit has to be very big.
p122
aVThis is a picture of Denver,
p123
aVand the outline is the new airport that was built in Denver.
p124
aVThis airport alone
p125
aVcovers more than 100 square kilometers.
p126
aVSo I was trying to persuade the Hondurans,
p127
aVif you build a new city,
p128
aVyou've got to start with a site that's at least 1,000 square kilometers.
p129
aVThat's more than 250 hundred-thousand acres.
p130
aVEverybody applauded politely.
p131
aVThe faces in the audience
p132
aVwere very serious and attentive.
p133
aVThe leader of the congress came up on stage and said,
p134
aV"Professor Romer, thank you very much for your lecture,
p135
aVbut maybe we could watch the TEDTalk.
p136
aVI've got it here on my laptop."
p137
aVSo I sat down, and they played the TEDTalk.
p138
aa(lp139
VAnd it got to the essence,
p140
aVwhich is that a new city could offer new choices for people.
p141
aVThere would be a choice of a city which you could go to
p142
aVwhich could be in Honduras,
p143
aVinstead of hundreds of miles away in the North.
p144
aVAnd it also involved new choices for leaders.
p145
aVBecause the leaders in the government there in Honduras
p146
aVwould need help from partner countries,
p147
aVwho could benefit from partner countries
p148
aVwho help them set up the rules in this charter and the enforcement,
p149
aVso everybody can trust
p150
aVthat the charter really will be enforced.
p151
aVAnd the insight of President Lobo
p152
aVwas that that assurance of enforcement
p153
aVthat I was thinking about
p154
aVas a way to get the foreign investors to come in and build the city
p155
aVcould be equally important for all the different parties in Honduras
p156
aVwho had suffered for so many years
p157
aVfrom fear and distrust.
p158
aa(lp159
VWe went and looked at a site.
p160
aVThis picture's from there.
p161
aVIt easily could hold a thousand square kilometers.
p162
aVAnd shortly thereafter, on January 19th,
p163
aVthey voted in the congress to amend their constitution
p164
aVto have a constitutional provision
p165
aVthat allows for special development regions.
p166
aVIn a country which had just gone through this wrenching crisis,
p167
aVthe vote in the congress in favor of this constitutional amendment
p168
aVwas 124 to one.
p169
aVAll parties, all factions in society, backed this.
p170
aVTo be part of the constitution, you actually have to pass it twice in the congress.
p171
aVOn February 17th they passed it again
p172
aVwith another vote of 114 to one.
p173
aa(lp174
VImmediately after that vote,
p175
aVon February 21st to the 24th,
p176
aVa delegation of about 30 Hondurans
p177
aVwent to the two places in the world
p178
aVthat are most interested in getting into the city building business.
p179
aVOne is South Korea.
p180
aVThis is a picture of a big, new city center
p181
aVthat's being built in South Korea \u2014
p182
aVbigger than downtown Boston.
p183
aVEverything you see there was built in four years,
p184
aVafter they spent four years getting the permits.
p185
aVThe other place that's very interested in city building is Singapore.
p186
aVThey've actually built two cities already in China
p187
aVand are preparing the third.
p188
aa(lp189
VSo if you think about this practically,
p190
aVhere's where we are.
p191
aVThey've got a site; they're already thinking about this site for the second city.
p192
aVThey're putting in place a legal system
p193
aVthat could allow for managers to come in,
p194
aVand also an external legal system.
p195
aVOne country has already volunteered to let its supreme court
p196
aVbe the court of final appeal for the new judicial system there.
p197
aVThere's designers and builders of cities
p198
aVwho are very interested.
p199
aVThey even can bring with them some financing.
p200
aVBut the one thing you know they've already solved
p201
aVis that there's lots of tenants.
p202
aVThere's lots of businesses that would like to locate in the Americas,
p203
aVespecially in a place with a free trade zone,
p204
aVand there's lots of people who'd like to go there.
p205
aVAround the world, there's 700 million people
p206
aVwho say they'd like to move permanently someplace else right now.
p207
aa(lp208
VThere's a million a year
p209
aVwho leave Latin America to go to the United States.
p210
aVMany of these are a father
p211
aVwho has to leave his family behind to go get a job \u2014
p212
aVsometimes a single mother
p213
aVwho has to get enough money to even pay for food or clothing.
p214
aVSadly, sometimes there are even children
p215
aVwho are trying to get reunited with their parents
p216
aVthat they haven't seen, in some cases, for a decade.
p217
aa(lp218
VSo what kind of an idea is it
p219
aVto think about building a brand new city in Honduras?
p220
aVOr to build a dozen of these,
p221
aVor a hundred of these, around the world?
p222
aVWhat kind of an idea is it
p223
aVto think about insisting
p224
aVthat every family have a choice of several cities
p225
aVthat are competing to attract new residents?
p226
aVThis is an idea worth spreading.
p227
aVAnd my friends from Honduras
p228
aVasked me to say thank you, TED.
