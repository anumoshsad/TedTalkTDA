VWhen my first children's book was published
p4
aVin 2001,
p5
aVI returned to my old elementary school
p6
aVto talk to the students about being an author
p7
aVand an illustrator,
p8
aVand when I was setting up my slide projector
p9
aVin the cafetorium,
p10
aVI looked across the room,
p11
aVand there she was:
p12
aVmy old lunch lady.
p13
aVShe was still there at the school
p14
aVand she was busily preparing lunches for the day.
p15
aVSo I approached her to say hello,
p16
aVand I said, "Hi, Jeannie! How are you?"
p17
aVAnd she looked at me, and I could tell
p18
aVthat she recognized me,
p19
aVbut she couldn't quite place me, and she looked at me and she said,
p20
aV"Stephen Krosoczka?"
p21
aVAnd I was amazed that she knew I was a Krosoczka,
p22
aVbut Stephen is my uncle who is 20 years older than I am,
p23
aVand she had been his lunch lady when he was a kid.
p24
aVAnd she started telling me about her grandkids,
p25
aVand that blew my mind.
p26
aVMy lunch lady had grandkids,
p27
aVand therefore kids,
p28
aVand therefore left school at the end of the day?
p29
aVI thought she lived in the cafeteria
p30
aVwith the serving spoons.
p31
aVI had never thought about any of that before.
p32
aa(lp33
VWell, that chance encounter inspired my imagination,
p34
aVand I created the Lunch Lady graphic novel series,
p35
aVa series of comics about a lunch lady
p36
aVwho uses her fish stick nunchucks
p37
aVto fight off evil cyborg substitutes,
p38
aVa school bus monster, and mutant mathletes,
p39
aVand the end of every book,
p40
aVthey get the bad guy with their hairnet,
p41
aVand they proclaim, "Justice is served!"
p42
aa(lp43
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p44
aa(lp45
VAnd it's been amazing, because the series
p46
aVwas so welcomed into the reading lives of children,
p47
aVand they sent me the most amazing letters
p48
aVand cards and artwork.
p49
aVAnd I would notice as I would visit schools,
p50
aVthe lunch staff would be involved in the programming
p51
aVin a very meaningful way.
p52
aVAnd coast to coast,
p53
aVall of the lunch ladies told me the same thing:
p54
aV"Thank you for making a superhero in our likeness."
p55
aVBecause the lunch lady has not been treated
p56
aVvery kindly in popular culture over time.
p57
aVBut it meant the most to Jeannie.
p58
aVWhen the books were first published,
p59
aVI invited her to the book launch party,
p60
aVand in front of everyone there,
p61
aVeveryone she had fed over the years,
p62
aVI gave her a piece of artwork and some books.
p63
aVAnd two years after this photo was taken,
p64
aVshe passed away,
p65
aVand I attended her wake,
p66
aVand nothing could have prepared me for what I saw there,
p67
aVbecause next to her casket was this painting,
p68
aVand her husband told me it meant so much to her
p69
aVthat I had acknowledged her hard work,
p70
aVI had validated what she did.
p71
aa(lp72
VAnd that inspired me to create a day
p73
aVwhere we could recreate that feeling
p74
aVin cafeterias across the country:
p75
aVSchool Lunch Hero Day, a day where kids
p76
aVcan make creative projects for their lunch staff.
p77
aVAnd I partnered with the School Nutrition Association,
p78
aVand did you know that a little over 30 million kids
p79
aVparticipate in school lunch programs every day.
p80
aVThat equals up to a little over five billion lunches
p81
aVmade every school year.
p82
aa(lp83
VAnd the stories of heroism go well beyond
p84
aVjust a kid getting a few extra chicken nuggets
p85
aVon their lunch tray.
p86
aVThere is Ms. Brenda in California,
p87
aVwho keeps a close eye on every student that comes through her line
p88
aVand then reports back to the guidance counselor
p89
aVif anything is amiss.
p90
aVThere are the lunch ladies in Kentucky
p91
aVwho realized that 67 percent of their students
p92
aVrelied on those meals every day,
p93
aVand they were going without food over the summer,
p94
aVso they retrofitted a school bus
p95
aVto create a mobile feeding unit,
p96
aVand they traveled around the neighborhoods
p97
aVfeedings 500 kids a day during the summer.
p98
aa(lp99
VAnd kids made the most amazing projects.
p100
aVI knew they would.
p101
aVKids made hamburger cards
p102
aVthat were made out of construction paper.
p103
aVThey took photos of their lunch lady's head
p104
aVand plastered it onto my cartoon lunch lady
p105
aVand fixed that to a milk carton
p106
aVand presented them with flowers.
p107
aVAnd they made their own comics,
p108
aVstarring the cartoon lunch lady
p109
aValongside their actual lunch ladies.
p110
aVAnd they made thank you pizzas,
p111
aVwhere every kid signed a different topping
p112
aVof a construction paper pizza.
p113
aa(lp114
VFor me, I was so moved by the response
p115
aVthat came from the lunch ladies,
p116
aVbecause one woman said to me, she said,
p117
aV"Before this day, I felt like I was
p118
aVat the end of the planet at this school.
p119
aVI didn't think that anyone noticed us down here."
p120
aVAnother woman said to me,
p121
aV"You know, what I got out of this
p122
aVis that what I do is important."
p123
aa(lp124
VAnd of course what she does is important.
p125
aVWhat they all do is important.
p126
aVThey're feeding our children every single day,
p127
aVand before a child can learn,
p128
aVtheir belly needs to be full,
p129
aVand these women and men
p130
aVare working on the front lines to create
p131
aVan educated society.
p132
aa(lp133
VSo I hope that
p134
aVyou don't wait for School Lunch Hero Day
p135
aVto say thank you to your lunch staff,
p136
aVand I hope that you remember
p137
aVhow powerful a thank you can be.
p138
aVA thank you can change a life.
p139
aVIt changes the life of the person who receives it,
p140
aVand it changes the life of the person
p141
aVwho expresses it.
p142
aa(lp143
VThank you.
