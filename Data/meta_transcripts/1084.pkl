VTen years ago exactly,
p4
aVI was in Afghanistan.
p5
aVI was covering the war in Afghanistan,
p6
aVand I witnessed, as a reporter for Al Jazeera,
p7
aVthe amount of suffering and destruction
p8
aVthat emerged out of a war like that.
p9
aVThen, two years later,
p10
aVI covered another war \u2014 the war in Iraq.
p11
aVI was placed at the center of that war
p12
aVbecause I was covering the war
p13
aVfrom the northern part of Iraq.
p14
aVAnd the war ended
p15
aVwith a regime change,
p16
aVlike the one in Afghanistan.
p17
aVAnd that regime
p18
aVthat we got rid of
p19
aVwas actually a dictatorship,
p20
aVan authoritarian regime,
p21
aVthat for decades
p22
aVcreated a great sense of paralysis
p23
aVwithin the nation, within the people themselves.
p24
aVHowever,
p25
aVthe change that came through foreign intervention
p26
aVcreated even worse circumstances for the people
p27
aVand deepened the sense
p28
aVof paralysis and inferiority
p29
aVin that part of the world.
p30
aa(lp31
VFor decades,
p32
aVwe have lived under authoritarian regimes \u2014
p33
aVin the Arab world, in the Middle East.
p34
aVThese regimes
p35
aVcreated something within us during this period.
p36
aVI'm 43 years old right now.
p37
aVFor the last 40 years,
p38
aVI have seen almost the same faces
p39
aVfor kings and presidents ruling us \u2014
p40
aVold, aged, authoritarian,
p41
aVcorrupt situations \u2014
p42
aVregimes that we have seen around us.
p43
aVAnd for a moment I was wondering,
p44
aVare we going to live in order to see
p45
aVreal change happening on the ground,
p46
aVa change that does not come through foreign intervention,
p47
aVthrough the misery of occupation,
p48
aVthrough nations invading our land
p49
aVand deepening the sense of inferiority sometimes?
p50
aVThe Iraqis: yes, they got rid of Saddam Hussein,
p51
aVbut when they saw
p52
aVtheir land occupied by foreign forces
p53
aVthey felt very sad,
p54
aVthey felt that their dignity had suffered.
p55
aVAnd this is why they revolted.
p56
aVThis is why they did not accept.
p57
aVAnd actually other regimes, they told their citizens,
p58
aV"Would you like to see the situation of Iraq?
p59
aVWould you like to see civil war, sectarian killing?
p60
aVWould you like to see destruction?
p61
aVWould you like to see foreign troops on your land?"
p62
aVAnd the people thought for themselves,
p63
aV"Maybe we should live with
p64
aVthis kind of authoritarian situation that we find ourselves in,
p65
aVinstead of having the second scenario."
p66
aVThat was one of the worst nightmares that we have seen.
p67
aa(lp68
VFor 10 years,
p69
aVunfortunately we have found ourselves
p70
aVreporting images of destruction,
p71
aVimages of killing,
p72
aVof sectarian conflicts,
p73
aVimages of violence,
p74
aVemerging from a magnificent piece of land,
p75
aVa region that one day was the source
p76
aVof civilizations and art and culture
p77
aVfor thousands of years.
p78
aVNow I am here to tell you
p79
aVthat the future
p80
aVthat we were dreaming for
p81
aVhas eventually arrived.
p82
aVA new generation,
p83
aVwell-educated,
p84
aVconnected,
p85
aVinspired by universal values
p86
aVand a global understanding,
p87
aVhas created a new reality for us.
p88
aVWe have found a new way
p89
aVto express our feelings
p90
aVand to express our dreams:
p91
aVthese young people
p92
aVwho have restored self-confidence
p93
aVin our nations in that part of the world,
p94
aVwho have given us
p95
aVnew meaning for freedom
p96
aVand empowered us to go down to the streets.
p97
aVNothing happened. No violence. Nothing.
p98
aVJust step out of your house,
p99
aVraise your voice
p100
aVand say, "We would like to see the end of the regime."
p101
aa(lp102
VThis is what happened in Tunisia.
p103
aVOver a few days,
p104
aVthe Tunisian regime that invested billions of dollars
p105
aVin the security agencies,
p106
aVbillions of dollars
p107
aVin maintaining, trying to maintain,
p108
aVits prisons,
p109
aVcollapsed, disappeared,
p110
aVbecause of the voices of the public.
p111
aVPeople who were inspired to go down to the streets
p112
aVand to raise their voices,
p113
aVthey tried to kill.
p114
aVThe intelligence agencies wanted to arrest people.
p115
aVThey found something called Facebook.
p116
aVThey found something called Twitter.
p117
aVThey were surprised by all of these kinds of issues.
p118
aVAnd they said,
p119
aV"These kids are misled."
p120
aVTherefore, they asked their parents
p121
aVto go down to the streets
p122
aVand collect them, bring them back home.
p123
aVThis is what they were telling. This is their propaganda.
p124
aV"Bring these kids home
p125
aVbecause they are misled."
p126
aVBut yes,
p127
aVthese youth
p128
aVwho have been inspired
p129
aVby universal values,
p130
aVwho are idealistic enough
p131
aVto imagine a magnificent future
p132
aVand, at the same time, realistic enough
p133
aVto balance this kind of imagination
p134
aVand the process leading to it \u2014
p135
aVnot using violence,
p136
aVnot trying to create chaos \u2014
p137
aVthese young people,
p138
aVthey did not go home.
p139
aVParents actually went to the streets
p140
aVand they supported them.
p141
aVAnd this is how the revolution was born in Tunisia.
p142
aa(lp143
VWe in Al Jazeera
p144
aVwere banned from Tunisia for years,
p145
aVand the government did not allow
p146
aVany Al Jazeera reporter to be there.
p147
aVBut we found that these people in the street,
p148
aVall of them are our reporters,
p149
aVfeeding our newsroom
p150
aVwith pictures, with videos
p151
aVand with news.
p152
aVAnd suddenly that newsroom in Doha
p153
aVbecame a center
p154
aVthat received all this kind of input from ordinary people \u2014
p155
aVpeople who are connected and people who have ambition
p156
aVand who have liberated themselves
p157
aVfrom the feeling of inferiority.
p158
aVAnd then we took that decision:
p159
aVWe are unrolling the news.
p160
aVWe are going to be the voice for these voiceless people.
p161
aVWe are going to spread the message.
p162
aVYes, some of these young people
p163
aVare connected to the Internet,
p164
aVbut the connectivity in the Arab world
p165
aVis very little, is very small,
p166
aVbecause of many problems that we are suffering from.
p167
aVBut Al Jazeera took the voice from these people
p168
aVand we amplified [it].
p169
aVWe put it in every sitting room in the Arab world \u2014
p170
aVand internationally, globally,
p171
aVthrough our English channel.
p172
aa(lp173
VAnd then people started to feel
p174
aVthat there's something new happening.
p175
aVAnd then Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali
p176
aVdecided to leave.
p177
aVAnd then Egypt started,
p178
aVand Hosni Mubarak decided to leave.
p179
aVAnd now Libya as you see it.
p180
aVAnd then you have Yemen.
p181
aVAnd you have many other countries trying to see
p182
aVand to rediscover that feeling
p183
aVof, "How do we imagine a future
p184
aVwhich is magnificent and peaceful and tolerant?"
p185
aVI want to tell you something,
p186
aVthat the Internet and connectivity
p187
aVhas created [a] new mindset.
p188
aVBut this mindset
p189
aVhas continued to be faithful
p190
aVto the soil and to the land
p191
aVthat it emerged from.
p192
aVAnd while this was the major difference
p193
aVbetween many initiatives before
p194
aVto create change,
p195
aVbefore we thought, and governments told us \u2014
p196
aVand even sometimes it was true \u2014
p197
aVthat change was imposed on us,
p198
aVand people rejected that,
p199
aVbecause they thought that it is alien to their culture.
p200
aVAlways, we believed
p201
aVthat change will spring from within,
p202
aVthat change should be a reconciliation
p203
aVwith culture, cultural diversity,
p204
aVwith our faith in our tradition
p205
aVand in our history,
p206
aVbut at the same time,
p207
aVopen to universal values, connected with the world,
p208
aVtolerant to the outside.
p209
aVAnd this is the moment
p210
aVthat is happening right now in the Arab world.
p211
aVThis is the right moment, and this is the actual moment
p212
aVthat we see all of these meanings meet together
p213
aVand then create the beginning
p214
aVof this magnificent era
p215
aVthat will emerge from the region.
p216
aa(lp217
VHow did the elite deal with that \u2014
p218
aVthe so-called political elite?
p219
aVIn front of Facebook,
p220
aVthey brought the camels in Tahrir Square.
p221
aVIn front of Al Jazeera,
p222
aVthey started creating tribalism.
p223
aVAnd then when they failed,
p224
aVthey started speaking about conspiracies
p225
aVthat emerged from Tel Aviv and Washington
p226
aVin order to divide the Arab world.
p227
aVThey started telling the West,
p228
aV"Be aware of Al-Qaeda.
p229
aVAl-Qaeda is taking over our territories.
p230
aVThese are Islamists
p231
aVtrying to create new Imaras.
p232
aVBe aware of these people
p233
aVwho [are] coming to you
p234
aVin order to ruin your great civilization."
p235
aVFortunately,
p236
aVpeople right now cannot be deceived.
p237
aVBecause this corrupt elite
p238
aVin that region
p239
aVhas lost even the power of deception.
p240
aVThey could not, and they cannot, imagine
p241
aVhow they could really deal with this reality.
p242
aVThey have lost.
p243
aVThey have been detached
p244
aVfrom their people, from the masses,
p245
aVand now we are seeing them collapsing
p246
aVone after the other.
p247
aa(lp248
VAl Jazeera is not
p249
aVa tool of revolution.
p250
aVWe do not create revolutions.
p251
aVHowever,
p252
aVwhen something of that magnitude happens,
p253
aVwe are at the center of the coverage.
p254
aVWe were banned from Egypt,
p255
aVand our correspondents,
p256
aVsome of them were arrested.
p257
aVBut most of our camera people
p258
aVand our journalists,
p259
aVthey went underground in Egypt \u2014 voluntarily \u2014
p260
aVto report what happened in Tahrir Square.
p261
aVFor 18 days,
p262
aVour cameras were broadcasting, live,
p263
aVthe voices of the people in Tahrir Square.
p264
aVI remember one night
p265
aVwhen someone phoned me on my cellphone \u2014
p266
aVordinary person who I don't know \u2014 from Tahrir Square.
p267
aVHe told me, "We appeal to you
p268
aVnot to switch off the cameras.
p269
aVIf you switch off the cameras tonight,
p270
aVthere will be a genocide.
p271
aVYou are protecting us
p272
aVby showing what is happening at Tahrir Square."
p273
aVI felt the responsibility
p274
aVto phone our correspondents there
p275
aVand to phone our newsroom
p276
aVand to tell them, "Make your best
p277
aVnot to switch off the cameras at night,
p278
aVbecause the guys there really feel confident
p279
aVwhen someone is reporting their story \u2014
p280
aVand they feel protected as well."
p281
aa(lp282
VSo we have a chance
p283
aVto create a new future
p284
aVin that part of the world.
p285
aVWe have a chance
p286
aVto go and to think of the future
p287
aVas something which is open to the world.
p288
aVLet us not repeat the mistake of Iran,
p289
aVof [the] Mosaddeq revolution.
p290
aVLet us free ourselves \u2014 especially in the West \u2014
p291
aVfrom thinking about that part of the world
p292
aVbased on oil interest,
p293
aVor based on interests
p294
aVof the illusion of stability and security.
p295
aVThe stability and security
p296
aVof authoritarian regimes
p297
aVcannot create
p298
aVbut terrorism and violence and destruction.
p299
aVLet us accept the choice of the people.
p300
aVLet us not pick and choose
p301
aVwho we would like to rule their future.
p302
aVThe future should be ruled
p303
aVby people themselves,
p304
aVeven sometimes if they are voices
p305
aVthat might now scare us.
p306
aVBut the values of democracy
p307
aVand the freedom of choice
p308
aVthat is sweeping the Middle East at this moment in time
p309
aVis the best opportunity for the world,
p310
aVfor the West and the East,
p311
aVto see stability and to see security
p312
aVand to see friendship and to see tolerance
p313
aVemerging from the Arab world,
p314
aVrather than the images of violence and terrorism.
p315
aVLet us support these people.
p316
aVLet us stand for them.
p317
aVAnd let us give up
p318
aVour narrow selfishness
p319
aVin order to embrace change,
p320
aVand in order to celebrate with the people of that region
p321
aVa great future
p322
aVand hope and tolerance.
p323
aVThe future has arrived,
p324
aVand the future is now.
p325
aVI thank you very much.
p326
aa(lp327
V(Applause)
p328
aa(lp329
VThank you very much.
p330
aa(lp331
V(Applause)
p332
aa(lp333
VChris Anderson: I just have a couple of questions for you.
p334
aVThank you for coming here.
p335
aVHow would you characterize the historical significance
p336
aVof what's happened?
p337
aVIs this a story-of-the-year, a story-of-the-decade
p338
aVor something more?
p339
aa(lp340
VWadah Khanfar: Actually, this may be the biggest story that we have ever covered.
p341
aVWe have covered many wars.
p342
aVWe have covered a lot of tragedies, a lot of problems,
p343
aVa lot of conflict zones, a lot of hot spots in the region,
p344
aVbecause we were centered at the middle of it.
p345
aVBut this is a story \u2014 it is a great story; it is beautiful.
p346
aVIt is not something that you only cover
p347
aVbecause you have to cover a great incident.
p348
aVYou are witnessing change in history.
p349
aVYou are witnessing the birth of a new era.
p350
aVAnd this is what the story's all about.
p351
aa(lp352
VCA: There are a lot of people in the West
p353
aVwho are still skeptical,
p354
aVor think this may just be an intermediate stage
p355
aVbefore much more alarming chaos.
p356
aVYou really believe
p357
aVthat if there are democratic elections in Egypt now,
p358
aVthat a government could emerge
p359
aVthat espouses some of the values you've spoken about so inspiringly?
p360
aa(lp361
VWK: And people actually,
p362
aVafter the collapse of the Hosni Mubarak regime,
p363
aVthe youth who have organized themselves
p364
aVin certain groups and councils,
p365
aVthey are guarding the transformation
p366
aVand they are trying to put it on a track
p367
aVin order to satisfy
p368
aVthe values of democracy,
p369
aVbut at the same time
p370
aValso to make it reasonable
p371
aVand to make it rational,
p372
aVnot to go out of order.
p373
aVIn my opinion, these people are much more wiser
p374
aVthan, not only the political elite,
p375
aVeven the intellectual elite, even opposition leaders
p376
aVincluding political parties.
p377
aVAt this moment in time, the youth in the Arab world
p378
aVare much more wiser
p379
aVand capable of creating the change
p380
aVthan the old \u2014
p381
aVincluding the political and cultural
p382
aVand ideological
p383
aVold regimes.
p384
aa(lp385
V(Applause)
p386
aa(lp387
VCA: We are not to get involved politically and interfere in that way.
p388
aVWhat should people here at TED,
p389
aVhere in the West,
p390
aVdo if they want to connect or make a difference
p391
aVand they believe in what's happening here?
p392
aa(lp393
VWK: I think we have discovered a very important issue in the Arab world \u2014
p394
aVthat people care,
p395
aVpeople care about this great transformation.
p396
aVMohamed Nanabhay who's sitting with us,
p397
aVthe head of Aljazeera.net,
p398
aVhe told me that a 2,500 percent increase
p399
aVof accessing our website
p400
aVfrom various parts of the world.
p401
aVFifty percent of it is coming from America.
p402
aVBecause we discovered that people care,
p403
aVand people would like to know \u2014
p404
aVthey are receiving the stream through our Internet.
p405
aVUnfortunately in the United States,
p406
aVwe are not covering but Washington D.C. at this moment in time
p407
aVfor Al Jazeera English.
p408
aVBut I can tell you, this is the moment to celebrate
p409
aVthrough connecting ourselves
p410
aVwith those people in the street
p411
aVand expressing our support to them
p412
aVand expressing this kind of feeling, universal feeling,
p413
aVof supporting the weak and the oppressed
p414
aVto create a much better future for all of us.
p415
aa(lp416
VCA: Well Wadah, a group of members of the TED community,
p417
aVTEDxCairo,

aVare meeting as we speak.
p419
aVThey've had some speakers there.
