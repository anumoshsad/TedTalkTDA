VWhat makes a great leader today?
p4
aVMany of us carry this image
p5
aVof this all-knowing superhero
p6
aVwho stands and commands
p7
aVand protects his followers.
p8
aVBut that's kind of an image from another time,
p9
aVand what's also outdated
p10
aVare the leadership development programs
p11
aVthat are based on success models
p12
aVfor a world that was, not a world that is
p13
aVor that is coming.
p14
aa(lp15
VWe conducted a study of 4,000 companies,
p16
aVand we asked them, let's see the effectiveness
p17
aVof your leadership development programs.
p18
aVFifty-eight percent of the companies
p19
aVcited significant talent gaps
p20
aVfor critical leadership roles.
p21
aVThat means that despite corporate training programs,
p22
aVoff-sites, assessments, coaching, all of these things,
p23
aVmore than half the companies
p24
aVhad failed to grow enough great leaders.
p25
aVYou may be asking yourself,
p26
aVis my company helping me to prepare
p27
aVto be a great 21st-century leader?
p28
aVThe odds are, probably not.
p29
aa(lp30
VNow, I've spent 25 years of my professional life
p31
aVobserving what makes great leaders.
p32
aVI've worked inside Fortune 500 companies,
p33
aVI've advised over 200 CEOs,
p34
aVand I've cultivated more leadership pipelines
p35
aVthan you can imagine.
p36
aVBut a few years ago, I noticed a disturbing trend
p37
aVin leadership preparation.
p38
aVI noticed that, despite all the efforts,
p39
aVthere were familiar stories that kept resurfacing
p40
aVabout individuals.
p41
aVOne story was about Chris,
p42
aVa high-potential, superstar leader
p43
aVwho moves to a new unit and fails,
p44
aVdestroying unrecoverable value.
p45
aVAnd then there were stories like Sidney, the CEO,
p46
aVwho was so frustrated
p47
aVbecause her company is cited
p48
aVas a best company for leaders,
p49
aVbut only one of the top 50 leaders is equipped
p50
aVto lead their crucial initiatives.
p51
aVAnd then there were stories
p52
aVlike the senior leadership team
p53
aVof a once-thriving business
p54
aVthat's surprised by a market shift,
p55
aVfinds itself having to force the company
p56
aVto reduce its size in half
p57
aVor go out of business.
p58
aa(lp59
VNow, these recurring stories
p60
aVcause me to ask two questions.
p61
aVWhy are the leadership gaps widening
p62
aVwhen there's so much more investment
p63
aVin leadership development?
p64
aVAnd what are the great leaders doing
p65
aVdistinctly different to thrive and grow?
p66
aVOne of the things that I did,
p67
aVI was so consumed by these questions
p68
aVand also frustrated by those stories,
p69
aVthat I left my job
p70
aVso that I could study this full time,
p71
aVand I took a year to travel
p72
aVto different parts of the world
p73
aVto learn about effective and ineffective
p74
aVleadership practices in companies,
p75
aVcountries and nonprofit organizations.
p76
aVAnd so I did things like travel to South Africa,
p77
aVwhere I had an opportunity to understand
p78
aVhow Nelson Mandela was ahead of his time
p79
aVin anticipating and navigating
p80
aVhis political, social and economic context.
p81
aVI also met a number of nonprofit leaders
p82
aVwho, despite very limited financial resources,
p83
aVwere making a huge impact in the world,
p84
aVoften bringing together seeming adversaries.
p85
aVAnd I spent countless hours in presidential libraries
p86
aVtrying to understand how the environment
p87
aVhad shaped the leaders,
p88
aVthe moves that they made,
p89
aVand then the impact of those moves
p90
aVbeyond their tenure.
p91
aVAnd then, when I returned to work full time,
p92
aVin this role, I joined with wonderful colleagues
p93
aVwho were also interested in these questions.
p94
aa(lp95
VNow, from all this, I distilled
p96
aVthe characteristics of leaders who are thriving
p97
aVand what they do differently,
p98
aVand then I also distilled
p99
aVthe preparation practices that enable people
p100
aVto grow to their potential.
p101
aVI want to share some of those with you now.
p102
aa(lp103
V("What makes a great leader in the 21st century?")
p104
aa(lp105
VIn a 21st-century world, which is more global,
p106
aVdigitally enabled and transparent,
p107
aVwith faster speeds of information  flow and innovation,
p108
aVand where nothing big gets done
p109
aVwithout some kind of a complex matrix,
p110
aVrelying on traditional development practices
p111
aVwill stunt your growth as a leader.
p112
aVIn fact, traditional assessments
p113
aVlike narrow 360 surveys or outdated performance criteria
p114
aVwill give you false positives,
p115
aVlulling you into thinking that you are more prepared
p116
aVthan you really are.
p117
aVLeadership in the 21st century is defined
p118
aVand evidenced by three questions.
p119
aa(lp120
VWhere are you looking
p121
aVto anticipate the next change
p122
aVto your business model or your life?
p123
aVThe answer to this question is on your calendar.
p124
aVWho are you spending time with? On what topics?
p125
aVWhere are you traveling? What are you reading?
p126
aVAnd then how are you distilling this
p127
aVinto understanding potential discontinuities,
p128
aVand then making a decision to do something
p129
aVright now so that you're prepared and ready?
p130
aVThere's a leadership team that does a practice
p131
aVwhere they bring together each member
p132
aVcollecting, here are trends that impact me,
p133
aVhere are trends that impact another team member,
p134
aVand they share these,
p135
aVand then make decisions, to course-correct a strategy
p136
aVor to anticipate a new move.
p137
aVGreat leaders are not head-down.
p138
aVThey see around corners,
p139
aVshaping their future, not just reacting to it.
p140
aa(lp141
VThe second question is,
p142
aVwhat is the diversity measure
p143
aVof your personal and professional stakeholder network?
p144
aVYou know, we hear often about  good ol' boy networks
p145
aVand they're certainly alive and  well in many institutions.
p146
aVBut to some extent, we all have a network
p147
aVof people that we're comfortable with.
p148
aVSo this question is about your capacity
p149
aVto develop relationships with people
p150
aVthat are very different than you.
p151
aVAnd those differences can be biological,
p152
aVphysical, functional, political,  cultural, socioeconomic.
p153
aVAnd yet, despite all these differences,
p154
aVthey connect with you
p155
aVand they trust you enough
p156
aVto cooperate with you
p157
aVin achieving a shared goal.
p158
aVGreat leaders understand
p159
aVthat having a more diverse network
p160
aVis a source of pattern identification
p161
aVat greater levels and also of solutions,
p162
aVbecause you have people that are thinking
p163
aVdifferently than you are.
p164
aa(lp165
VThird question: are you courageous enough
p166
aVto abandon a practice that has  made you successful in the past?
p167
aVThere's an expression: Go along to get along.
p168
aVBut if you follow this advice,
p169
aVchances are as a leader,
p170
aVyou're going to keep doing what's familiar and comfortable.
p171
aVGreat leaders dare to be different.
p172
aVThey don't just talk about risk-taking,
p173
aVthey actually do it.
p174
aVAnd one of the leaders shared with me the fact that
p175
aVthe most impactful development comes
p176
aVwhen you are able to build the emotional stamina
p177
aVto withstand people telling you that your new idea
p178
aVis naïve or reckless or just plain stupid.
p179
aVNow interestingly, the people who will join you
p180
aVare not your usual suspects in your network.
p181
aVThey're often people that think differently
p182
aVand therefore are willing to join you
p183
aVin taking a courageous leap.
p184
aVAnd it's a leap, not a step.
p185
aVMore than traditional leadership programs,
p186
aVanswering these three questions
p187
aVwill determine your effectiveness
p188
aVas a 21st-century leader.
p189
aa(lp190
VSo what makes a great leader in the 21st century?
p191
aVI've met many, and they stand out.
p192
aVThey are women and men
p193
aVwho are preparing themselves
p194
aVnot for the comfortable predictability of yesterday
p195
aVbut also for the realities of today
p196
aVand all of those unknown possibilities of tomorrow.
p197
