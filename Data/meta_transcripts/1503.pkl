VI'm going to start with a little story.
p4
aVSo, I grew up in this neighborhood. When I was 15 years old,
p5
aVI went from being what I think was a strapping young athlete,
p6
aVover four months, slowly wasting away until
p7
aVI was basically a famine victim
p8
aVwith an unquenchable thirst.
p9
aVI had basically digested away my body.
p10
aVAnd this all came to a head when I was on a backpacking trip,
p11
aVmy first one ever actually, on Old Rag Mountain
p12
aVin West Virginia, and was putting my face into puddles
p13
aVof water and drinking like a dog.
p14
aa(lp15
VThat night, I was taken into the emergency room
p16
aVand diagnosed as a type 1 diabetic in full-blown ketoacidosis.
p17
aVAnd I recovered, thanks to the miracles of modern medicine,
p18
aVinsulin and other things, and gained all my weight back and more.
p19
aa(lp20
VAnd something festered inside me after this happened.
p21
aVWhat I thought about was, what caused the diabetes?
p22
aVYou see, diabetes is an autoimmune disease
p23
aVwhere your body fights itself, and at the time people thought
p24
aVthat somehow maybe exposure to a pathogen
p25
aVhad triggered my immune system to fight the pathogen
p26
aVand then kill the cells that make insulin.
p27
aVAnd this is what I thought for a long period of time,
p28
aVand that's in fact what medicine and people have focused on quite a bit,
p29
aVthe microbes that do bad things.
p30
aVAnd that's where I need my assistant here now.
p31
aVYou may recognize her.
p32
aa(lp33
VSo, I went yesterday, I apologize, I skipped a few of the talks,
p34
aVand I went over to the National Academy of Sciences building,
p35
aVand they sell toys, giant microbes.
p36
aVAnd here we go!
p37
aVSo you have caught flesh-eating disease if you caught that one.
p38
aVI gotta get back out my baseball ability here.
p39
aa(lp40
V(Laughter)
p41
aa(lp42
VSo, unfortunately or not surprisingly, most of the microbes
p43
aVthey sell at the National Academy building are pathogens.
p44
aVEverybody focuses on the things that kill us,
p45
aVand that's what I was focusing on.
p46
aVAnd it turns out that we are covered in a cloud of microbes,
p47
aVand those microbes actually do us good much of the time,
p48
aVrather than killing us.
p49
aVAnd so, we've known about this for some period of time.
p50
aVPeople have used microscopes to look at the microbes that cover us,
p51
aVI know you're not paying attention to me, but ...
p52
aa(lp53
V(Laughter)
p54
aa(lp55
VThe microbes that cover us.
p56
aVAnd if you look at them in the microscope,
p57
aVyou can see that we actually have 10 times as many cells
p58
aVof microbes on us as we have human cells.
p59
aVThere's more mass in the microbes than the mass of our brain.
p60
aa(lp61
VWe are literally a teeming ecosystem of microorganisms.
p62
aVAnd unfortunately, if you want to learn about the microorganisms,
p63
aVjust looking at them in a microscope is not sufficient.
p64
aVAnd so we just heard about the DNA sequencing.
p65
aVIt turns out that one of the best ways to look at microbes
p66
aVand to understand them is to look at their DNA.
p67
aVAnd that's what I've been doing for 20 years,
p68
aVusing DNA sequencing, collecting samples from various places,
p69
aVincluding the human body, reading the DNA sequence
p70
aVand then using that DNA sequencing to tell us about
p71
aVthe microbes that are in a particular place.
p72
aa(lp73
VAnd what's amazing, when you use this technology,
p74
aVfor example, looking at humans, we're not just covered
p75
aVin a sea of microbes.
p76
aVThere are thousands upon thousands of different kinds of microbes on us.
p77
aVWe have millions of genes of microbes in our human
p78
aVmicrobiome covering us.
p79
aVAnd so this microbial diversity differs between people,
p80
aVand what people have been thinking about in the last 10,
p81
aVmaybe 15 years is, maybe these microbes,
p82
aVthis microbial cloud in and on us,
p83
aVand the variation between us, may be responsible
p84
aVfor some of the health and illness differences between us.
p85
aa(lp86
VAnd that comes back to the diabetes story I was telling you.
p87
aVIt turns out that people now think that one of the triggers
p88
aVfor type 1 diabetes is not fighting a pathogen,
p89
aVbut is in fact trying to \u2014 miscommunicating with the microbes
p90
aVthat live in and on you.
p91
aVAnd somehow maybe the microbial community that's
p92
aVin and on me got off, and then this triggered some sort
p93
aVof immune response and led to me killing the cells
p94
aVthat make insulin in my body.
p95
aa(lp96
VAnd so what I want to tell you about for a few minutes is,
p97
aVwhat people have learned using DNA sequencing techniques
p98
aVin particular, to study the microbial cloud
p99
aVthat lives in and on us.
p100
aVAnd I want to tell you a story about a personal project.
p101
aVMy first personal experience with studying the microbes
p102
aVon the human body actually came from a talk that I gave,
p103
aVright around the corner from here at Georgetown.
p104
aa(lp105
VI gave a talk, and a family friend who happened to be
p106
aVthe Dean of Georgetown Medical School was at the talk,
p107
aVand came up to me afterwards saying, they were doing
p108
aVa study of ileal transplants in people.
p109
aVAnd they wanted to look at the microbes after the transplants.
p110
aa(lp111
VAnd so I started a collaboration with this person,
p112
aVMichael Zasloff and Thomas Fishbein, to look at the microbes
p113
aVthat colonized these ilea after they were transplanted into a recipient.
p114
aVAnd I can tell you all the details about the microbial study
p115
aVthat we did there, but the reason I want to tell you this story
p116
aVis something really striking that they did at the beginning
p117
aVof this project.
p118
aVThey take the donor ileum, which is filled with microbes from a donor
p119
aVand they have a recipient who might have a problem
p120
aVwith their microbial community, say Crohn's disease,
p121
aVand they sterilized the donor ileum.
p122
aVCleaned out all the microbes, and then put it in the recipient.
p123
aVThey did this because this was common practice
p124
aVin medicine, even though it was obvious
p125
aVthat this was not a good idea.
p126
aa(lp127
VAnd fortunately, in the course of this project,
p128
aVthe transplant surgeons and the other people
p129
aVdecided, forget common practice. We have to switch.
p130
aVSo they actually switched to leaving some of the microbial
p131
aVcommunity in the ileum. They leave the microbes with the donor,
p132
aVand theoretically that might help the people who are
p133
aVreceiving this ileal transplant.
p134
aa(lp135
VAnd so, people \u2014 this is a study that I did now.
p136
aVIn the last few years there's been a great expansion
p137
aVin using DNA technology to study the microbes in and on people.
p138
aVThere's something called the Human Microbiome Project
p139
aVthat's going on in the United States,
p140
aVand MetaHIT going on in Europe, and a lot of other projects.
p141
aa(lp142
VAnd when people have done a variety of studies,
p143
aVthey have learned things such as, when a baby is
p144
aVborn, during vaginal delivery you get colonized by the
p145
aVmicrobes from your mother.
p146
aVThere are risk factors associated with cesarean sections,
p147
aVsome of those risk factors may be due to mis-colonization
p148
aVwhen you carve a baby out of its mother
p149
aVrather than being delivered through the birth canal.
p150
aVAnd a variety of other studies have shown that the
p151
aVmicrobial community that lives in and on us
p152
aVhelps in development of the immune system,
p153
aVhelps in fighting off pathogens, helps in our metabolism,
p154
aVand determining our metabolic rate, probably
p155
aVdetermines our odor, and may even shape our behavior
p156
aVin a variety of ways.
p157
aa(lp158
VAnd so, these studies have documented or suggested
p159
aVout of a variety of important functions for the microbial community,
p160
aVthis cloud, the non-pathogens that live in and on us.
p161
aVAnd one area that I think is very interesting,
p162
aVwhich many of you may have now that we've thrown
p163
aVmicrobes into the crowd, is something that I would call "germophobia."
p164
aVSo people are really into cleanliness, right?
p165
aVWe have antibiotics in our kitchen counters,
p166
aVpeople are washing every part of them all of the time,
p167
aVwe pump antibiotics into our food, into our communities,
p168
aVwe take antibiotics excessively.
p169
aa(lp170
VAnd killing pathogens is a good thing if you're sick,
p171
aVbut we should understand that when we pump chemicals
p172
aVand antibiotics into our world, that we're also killing
p173
aVthe cloud of microbes that live in and on us.
p174
aVAnd excessive use of antibiotics, in particular in children,
p175
aVhas been shown to be associated with, again, risk factors
p176
aVfor obesity, for autoimmune diseases, for a variety
p177
aVof problems that are probably due to disruption
p178
aVof the microbial community.
p179
aa(lp180
VSo the microbial community can go wrong
p181
aVwhether we want it to or not,
p182
aVor we can kill it with antibiotics,
p183
aVbut what can we do to restore it?
p184
aVI'm sure many people here have heard about probiotics.
p185
aVProbiotics are one thing that you can try and do to restore
p186
aVthe microbial community that is in and on you.
p187
aVAnd they definitely have been shown to be effective in some cases.
p188
aVThere's a project going on at UC Davis where people are using
p189
aVprobiotics to try and treat, prevent,
p190
aVnecrotizing enterocolitis in premature infants.
p191
aVPremature infants have real problems with their microbial community.
p192
aVAnd it may be that probiotics can help prevent
p193
aVthe development of this horrible necrotizing enterocolitis
p194
aVin these premature infants.
p195
aa(lp196
VBut probiotics are sort of a very, very simple solution.
p197
aVMost of the pills that you can take or the yogurts that you can eat
p198
aVhave one or two species in them, maybe five species in them,
p199
aVand the human community is thousands upon thousands of species.
p200
aVSo what can we do to restore our microbial community
p201
aVwhen we have thousands and thousands of species on us?
p202
aa(lp203
VWell, one thing that animals seem to do is,
p204
aVthey eat poo \u2014 coprophagia.
p205
aVAnd it turns out that many veterinarians,
p206
aVold school veterinarians in particular,
p207
aVhave been doing something called "poo tea,"
p208
aVnot booty, but poo tea, to treat colic and other
p209
aVailments in horses and cows and things like that,
p210
aVwhere you make tea from the poo from a healthy
p211
aVindividual animal and you feed it to a sick animal.
p212
aVAlthough, unless you have a fistulated cow with a big hole in its side,
p213
aVand you can put your hand into its rumen,
p214
aVit's hard to imagine that the delivery of microbes
p215
aVdirectly into the mouth and through the entire
p216
aVtop of the digestive tract is the best delivery system,
p217
aVso you may have heard in people they are now doing
p218
aVfecal transplants, where rather than delivering
p219
aVa couple of probiotic microbes through the mouth,
p220
aVthey are delivering a community of probiotics,
p221
aVa community of microbes from a healthy donor,
p222
aVthrough the other end.
p223
aa(lp224
VAnd this has turned out to be very effective in fighting
p225
aVcertain intransigent infectious diseases
p226
aVlike Clostridium difficile infections that can stay
p227
aVwith people for years and years and years.
p228
aVTransplants of the feces, of the microbes from the feces,
p229
aVfrom a healthy donor has actually been shown to cure
p230
aVsystemic C. dif infections in some people.
p231
aa(lp232
VNow what these transplants, these fecal transplants, or
p233
aVthe poo tea suggest to me, and many other people
p234
aVhave come up with this same idea, is that
p235
aVthe microbial community in and on us, it's an organ.
p236
aVWe should view it as a functioning organ, part of ourselves.
p237
aVWe should treat it carefully and with respect,
p238
aVand we do not want to mess with it, say by C-sections
p239
aVor by antibiotics or excessive cleanliness,
p240
aVwithout some real good justification.
p241
aa(lp242
VAnd what the DNA sequencing technologies are allowing people to do now
p243
aVis do detailed studies of, say, 100 patients who have Crohn's disease
p244
aVand 100 people who don't have Crohn's disease.
p245
aVOr 100 people who took antibiotics when they were little,
p246
aVand 100 people who did not take antibiotics.
p247
aVAnd we can now start to compare the community of microbes
p248
aVand their genes and see if there are differences.
p249
aVAnd eventually we may be able to understand if they're not
p250
aVjust correlative differences, but causative.
p251
aVStudies in model systems like mouse and other animals
p252
aVare also helping do this, but people are now using
p253
aVthese technologies because they've gotten very cheap,
p254
aVto study the microbes in and on a variety of people.
p255
aa(lp256
VSo, in wrapping up, what I want to tell you about is,
p257
aVI didn't tell you a part of the story of coming down with diabetes.
p258
aVIt turns out that my father was an M.D.,
p259
aVactually studied hormones. I told him many times
p260
aVthat I was tired, thirsty, not feeling very good.
p261
aVAnd he shrugged it off, I think he either thought
p262
aVI was just complaining a lot, or it was the typical
p263
aVM.D. "nothing can be wrong with my children."
p264
aVWe even went to the International Society of Endocrinology
p265
aVmeeting as family in Quebec.
p266
aVAnd I was getting up every five minutes to pee,
p267
aVand drinking everybody's water at the table,
p268
aVand I think they all thought I was a druggie.
p269
aa(lp270
V(Laughter)
p271
aa(lp272
VBut the reason I'm telling you this is that
p273
aVthe medical community, my father as an example,
p274
aVsometimes doesn't see what's right in front of their eyes.
p275
aVThe microbial cloud, it is right in front of us.
p276
aVWe can't see it most of the time. It's invisible.
p277
aVThey're microbes. They're tiny.
p278
aVBut we can see them through their DNA,
p279
aVwe can see them through the effects that they have on people.
p280
aa(lp281
VAnd what we need now
p282
aVis to start thinking about this microbial community in the context
p283
aVof everything in human medicine.
p284
aVIt doesn't mean that it affects every part of us,
p285
aVbut it might.
p286
aVWhat we need is a full field guide to the microbes
p287
aVthat live in and on people, so that we can understand
p288
aVwhat they're doing to our lives.
p289
aVWe are them. They are us.
p290
aa(lp291
VThank you.
