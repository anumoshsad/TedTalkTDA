VSo I've been "futuring," which is a term I made up \u2014
p4
aa(lp5
V(Laughter)
p6
aa(lp7
Vabout three seconds ago.
p8
aVI've been futuring for about 20 years,
p9
aVand when I first started, I would sit down with people,
p10
aVand say, "Hey, let's talk 10, 20 years out."
p11
aVAnd they'd say, "Great."
p12
aVAnd I've been seeing that time horizon
p13
aVget shorter and shorter
p14
aVand shorter,
p15
aVso much so that I met with a CEO two months ago
p16
aVand I said \u2014 we started our initial conversation.
p17
aVHe goes, "I love what you do. I want to talk about the next six months."
p18
aa(lp19
V(Laughter)
p20
aa(lp21
VWe have a lot of problems that we are facing.
p22
aVThese are civilizational-scale problems.
p23
aVThe issue though is,
p24
aVwe can't solve them
p25
aVusing the mental models that we use right now
p26
aVto try and solve these problems.
p27
aVYes, a lot of great technical work is being done,
p28
aVbut there is a problem that we need to solve for a priori, before,
p29
aVif we want to really move the needle on those big problems.
p30
aV"Short-termism."
p31
aVRight? There's no marches. There's no bracelets.
p32
aVThere's no petitions that you can sign to be against short-termism.
p33
aVI tried to put one up, and no one signed.
p34
aVIt was weird.
p35
aa(lp36
V(Laughter)
p37
aa(lp38
VBut it prevents us from doing so much.
p39
aVShort-termism, for many reasons,
p40
aVhas pervaded every nook and cranny of our reality.
p41
aVI just want you to take a second
p42
aVand just think about an issue that you're thinking, working on.
p43
aVIt could be personal, it could be at work
p44
aVor it could be move-the-needle world stuff,
p45
aVand think about how far out you tend to think
p46
aVabout the solution set for that.
p47
aa(lp48
VBecause short-termism prevents the CEO
p49
aVfrom buying really expensive safety equipment.
p50
aVIt'll hurt the bottom line.
p51
aVSo we get the Deepwater Horizon.
p52
aVShort-termism prevents teachers
p53
aVfrom spending quality one-on-one time with their students.
p54
aVSo right now in America,
p55
aVa high school student drops out every 26 seconds.
p56
aVShort-termism prevents Congress \u2014
p57
aVsorry if there's anyone in here from Congress \u2014
p58
aa(lp59
V(Laughter)
p60
aa(lp61
Vor not really that sorry \u2014
p62
aa(lp63
V(Laughter)
p64
aa(lp65
Vfrom putting money into a real infrastructure bill.
p66
aVSo what we get is the I-35W bridge collapse
p67
aVover the Mississippi a few years ago,
p68
aV13 killed.
p69
aVIt wasn't always like this. We did the Panama Canal.
p70
aVWe pretty much have eradicated global polio.
p71
aVWe did the transcontinental railroad, the Marshall Plan.
p72
aVAnd it's not just big, physical infrastructure problems and issues.
p73
aVWomen's suffrage, the right to vote.
p74
aVBut in our short-termist time,
p75
aVwhere everything seems to happen right now
p76
aVand we can only think out past the next tweet or timeline post,
p77
aVwe get hyper-reactionary.
p78
aa(lp79
VSo what do we do?
p80
aVWe take people who are fleeing their war-torn country,
p81
aVand we go after them.
p82
aVWe take low-level drug offenders, and we put them away for life.
p83
aVAnd then we build McMansions without even thinking
p84
aVabout how people are going to get between them and their job.
p85
aVIt's a quick buck.
p86
aa(lp87
VNow, the reality is, for a lot of these problems,
p88
aVthere are some technical fixes,
p89
aVa lot of them.
p90
aVI call these technical fixes sandbag strategies.
p91
aVSo you know there's a storm coming,
p92
aVthe levee is broken, no one's put any money into it,
p93
aVyou surround your home with sandbags.
p94
aVAnd guess what? It works.
p95
aVStorm goes away, the water level goes down,
p96
aVyou get rid of the sandbags,
p97
aVand you do this storm after storm after storm.
p98
aVAnd here's the insidious thing.
p99
aVA sandbag strategy
p100
aVcan get you reelected.
p101
aVA sandbag strategy
p102
aVcan help you make your quarterly numbers.
p103
aa(lp104
VNow, if we want to move forward
p105
aVinto a different future than the one we have right now,
p106
aVbecause I don't think we've hit \u2014
p107
aV2016 is not peak civilization.
p108
aa(lp109
V(Laughter)
p110
aa(lp111
VThere's some more we can do.
p112
aVBut my argument is that unless we shift our mental models and our mental maps
p113
aVon how we think about the short,
p114
aVit's not going to happen.
p115
aa(lp116
VSo what I've developed is something called "longpath,"
p117
aVand it's a practice.
p118
aVAnd longpath isn't a kind of one-and-done exercise.
p119
aVI'm sure everyone here at some point has done an off-site
p120
aVwith a lot of Post-It notes and whiteboards,
p121
aVand you do \u2014
p122
aVno offense to the consultants in here who do that \u2014
p123
aVand you do a long-term plan,
p124
aVand then two weeks later, everyone forgets about it.
p125
aVRight? Or a week later. If you're lucky, three months.
p126
aVIt's a practice because it's not necessarily a thing that you do.
p127
aVIt's a process where you have to revisit different ways of thinking
p128
aVfor every major decision that you're working on.
p129
aVSo I want to go through those three ways of thinking.
p130
aa(lp131
VSo the first: transgenerational thinking.
p132
aVI love the philosophers:
p133
aVPlato, Socrates, Habermas, Heidegger.
p134
aVI was raised on them.
p135
aVBut they all did one thing
p136
aVthat didn't actually seem like a big deal
p137
aVuntil I really started kind of looking into this.
p138
aVAnd they all took,
p139
aVas a unit of measure for their entire reality
p140
aVof what it meant to be virtuous and good,
p141
aVthe single lifespan,
p142
aVfrom birth to death.
p143
aVBut here's a problem with these issues:
p144
aVthey stack up on top of us,
p145
aVbecause the only way we know how to do something good in the world
p146
aVis if we do it between our birth and our death.
p147
aVThat's what we're programmed to do.
p148
aVIf you go to the self-help section in any bookstore,
p149
aVit's all about you.
p150
aVWhich is great,
p151
aVunless you're dealing with some of these major issues.
p152
aVAnd so with transgenerational thinking,
p153
aVwhich is really kind of transgenerational ethics,
p154
aVyou're able to expand how you think about these problems,
p155
aVwhat is your role in helping to solve them.
p156
aa(lp157
VNow, this isn't something that just has to be done at the Security Council chamber.
p158
aVIt's something that you can do in a very kind of personal way.
p159
aVSo every once in a while, if I'm lucky, my wife and I like to go out to dinner,
p160
aVand we have three children under the age of seven.
p161
aVSo you can imagine it's a very peaceful, quiet meal.
p162
aa(lp163
V(Laughter)
p164
aa(lp165
VSo we sit down and literally all I want to do is just eat and chill,
p166
aVand my kids have a completely and totally different idea
p167
aVof what we're going to be doing.
p168
aVAnd so my first idea
p169
aVis my sandbag strategy, right?
p170
aVIt's to go into my pocket and take out the iPhone
p171
aVand give them "Frozen"
p172
aVor some other bestselling game thing.
p173
aVAnd then I stop
p174
aVand I have to kind of put on this transgenerational thinking cap.
p175
aVI don't do this in the restaurant, because it would be bizarre,
p176
aVbut I have to \u2014
p177
aVI did it once, and that's how I learned it was bizarre.
p178
aa(lp179
V(Laughter)
p180
aa(lp181
VAnd you have to kind of think, "OK, I can do this."
p182
aVBut what is this teaching them?
p183
aVSo what does it mean if I actually bring some paper
p184
aVor engage with them in conversation?
p185
aVIt's hard. It's not easy, and I'm making this very personal.
p186
aVIt's actually more traumatic
p187
aVthan some of the big issues that I work on in the world \u2014
p188
aVentertaining my kids at dinner.
p189
aVBut what it does is it connects them here in the present with me,
p190
aVbut it also \u2014
p191
aVand this is the crux of transgenerational thinking ethics \u2014
p192
aVit sets them up to how they're going to interact with their kids
p193
aVand their kids and their kids.
p194
aa(lp195
VSecond, futures thinking.
p196
aVWhen we think about the future,
p197
aV10, 15 years out,
p198
aVgive me a vision of what the future is.
p199
aVYou don't have to give it to me, but think in your head.
p200
aVAnd what you're probably going to see
p201
aVis the dominant cultural lens
p202
aVthat dominates our thinking about the future right now:
p203
aVtechnology.
p204
aVSo when we think about the problems,
p205
aVwe always put it through a technological lens,
p206
aVa tech-centric, a techno-utopia, and there's nothing wrong with that,
p207
aVbut it's something that we have to really think deeply about
p208
aVif we're going to move on these major issues,
p209
aVbecause it wasn't always like this. Right?
p210
aVThe ancients had their way of thinking
p211
aVabout what the future was.
p212
aVThe Church definitely had their idea of what the future could be,
p213
aVand you could actually pay your way into that future. Right?
p214
aVAnd luckily for humanity,
p215
aVwe got the scientific revolution.
p216
aVFrom there, we got the technology,
p217
aVbut what has happened \u2014
p218
aVAnd by the way, this is not a critique.
p219
aVI love technology.
p220
aVEverything in my house talks back to me,
p221
aVfrom my children to my speakers to everything.
p222
aa(lp223
V(Laughter)
p224
aa(lp225
VBut we've abdicated the future from the high priests in Rome
p226
aVto the high priests of Silicon Valley.
p227
aVSo when we think, well, how are we going to deal with climate
p228
aVor with poverty or homelessness,
p229
aVour first reaction is to think about it through a technology lens.
p230
aVAnd look, I'm not advocating that we go to this guy.
p231
aVI love Joel, don't get me wrong,
p232
aVbut I'm not saying we go to Joel.
p233
aVWhat I'm saying is we have to rethink
p234
aVour base assumption about only looking at the future in one way,
p235
aVonly looking at it through the dominant lens.
p236
aVBecause our problems are so big and so vast
p237
aVthat we need to open ourselves up.
p238
aa(lp239
VSo that's why I do everything in my power not to talk about the future.
p240
aVI talk about futures.
p241
aVIt opens the conversation again.
p242
aVSo when you're sitting and thinking
p243
aVabout how do we move forward on this major issue \u2014
p244
aVit could be at home,
p245
aVit could be at work,
p246
aVit could be again on the global stage \u2014
p247
aVdon't cut yourself off from thinking about something beyond technology as a fix
p248
aVbecause we're more concerned about technological evolution right now
p249
aVthan we are about moral evolution.
p250
aVAnd unless we fix for that,
p251
aVwe're not going to be able to get out of short-termism
p252
aVand get to where we want to be.
p253
aa(lp254
VThe final, telos thinking. This comes from the Greek root.
p255
aVUltimate aim and ultimate purpose.
p256
aVAnd it's really asking one question:
p257
aVto what end?
p258
aVWhen was the last time you asked yourself: To what end?
p259
aVAnd when you asked yourself that, how far out did you go?
p260
aVBecause long isn't long enough anymore.
p261
aVThree, five years doesn't cut it.
p262
aVIt's 30, 40, 50, 100 years.
p263
aa(lp264
VIn Homer's epic, "The Odyssey,"
p265
aVOdysseus had the answer to his "what end."
p266
aVIt was Ithaca.
p267
aVIt was this bold vision of what he wanted \u2014
p268
aVto return to Penelope.
p269
aVAnd I can tell you, because of the work that I'm doing,
p270
aVbut also you know it intuitively \u2014 we have lost our Ithaca.
p271
aVWe have lost our "to what end," so we stay on this hamster wheel.
p272
aVAnd yes, we're trying to solve these problems,
p273
aVbut what comes after we solve the problem?
p274
aVAnd unless you define what comes after, people aren't going to move.
p275
aVThe businesses \u2014 this isn't just about business \u2014
p276
aVbut the businesses that do consistently, who break out of short-termism
p277
aVnot surprisingly are family-run businesses.
p278
aVThey're transgenerational. They're telos. They think about the futures.
p279
aVAnd this is an ad for Patek Philippe. They're 175 years old,
p280
aVand what's amazing is that they literally embody
p281
aVthis kind of longpathian sense in their brand,
p282
aVbecause, by the way, you never actually own a Patek Philippe,
p283
aVand I definitely won't \u2014
p284
aa(lp285
V(Laughter)
p286
aa(lp287
Vunless somebody wants to just throw 25,000 dollars on the stage.
p288
aVYou merely look after it for the next generation.
p289
aa(lp290
VSo it's important that we remember,
p291
aVthe future, we treat it like a noun.
p292
aVIt's not. It's a verb.
p293
aVIt requires action.
p294
aVIt requires us to push into it.
p295
aVIt's not this thing that washes over us.
p296
aVIt's something that we actually have total control over.
p297
aVBut in a short-term society, we end up feeling like we don't.
p298
aVWe feel like we're trapped.
p299
aVWe can push through that.
p300
aa(lp301
VNow I'm getting more comfortable
p302
aVin the fact that at some point
p303
aVin the inevitable future,
p304
aVI will die.
p305
aVBut because of these new ways of thinking and doing,
p306
aVboth in the outside world and also with my family at home,
p307
aVand what I'm leaving my kids, I get more comfortable in that fact.
p308
aVAnd it's something that a lot of us are really uncomfortable with,
p309
aVbut I'm telling you,
p310
aVthink it through.
p311
aVApply this type of thinking and you can push yourself past
p312
aVwhat's inevitably very, very uncomfortable.
p313
aa(lp314
VAnd it all begins really with yourself asking this question:
p315
aVWhat is your longpath?
p316
aVBut I ask you, when you ask yourself that
p317
aVnow or tonight or behind a steering wheel
p318
aVor in the boardroom or the situation room:
p319
aVpush past the longpath,
p320
aVquick, oh, what's my longpath the next three years or five years?
p321
aVTry and push past your own life if you can
p322
aVbecause it makes you do things a little bit bigger
p323
aVthan you thought were possible.
p324
aa(lp325
VYes, we have huge, huge problems out there.
p326
aVWith this process, with this thinking,
p327
aVI think we can make a difference.
p328
aVI think you can make a difference,
p329
aVand I believe in you guys.
p330
aa(lp331
VThank you.
