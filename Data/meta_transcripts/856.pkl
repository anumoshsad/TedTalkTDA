VI have a daughter, Mulan.
p4
aVAnd when she was eight, last year,
p5
aVshe was doing a report for school
p6
aVor she had some homework about frogs.
p7
aVAnd we were at this restaurant,
p8
aVand she said, "So, basically,
p9
aVfrogs lay eggs
p10
aVand the eggs turn into tadpoles,
p11
aVand tadpoles turn into frogs."
p12
aa(lp13
VAnd I said, "Yeah. You know, I'm not really up on my frog reproduction that much.
p14
aVIt's the females, I think, that lay the eggs,
p15
aVand then the males fertilize them.
p16
aVAnd then they become tadpoles and frogs."
p17
aa(lp18
VAnd she says, "What? Only the females have eggs?"
p19
aa(lp20
VAnd I said, "Yeah."
p21
aa(lp22
VAnd she goes, "And what's this fertilizing?"
p23
aa(lp24
VSo I kind of said, "Oh, it's this extra ingredient,
p25
aVyou know, that you need
p26
aVto create a new frog
p27
aVfrom the mom and dad frog." (Laughter)
p28
aa(lp29
VAnd she said, "Oh, so is that true for humans too?"
p30
aa(lp31
VAnd I thought, "Okay, here we go."
p32
aVI didn't know it would happen so quick, at eight.
p33
aVI was trying to remember all the guidebooks,
p34
aVand all I could remember was,
p35
aV"Only answer the question they're asking.
p36
aVDon't give any more information." (Laughter)
p37
aVSo I said, "Yes."
p38
aa(lp39
VAnd she said, "And where do, um,
p40
aVwhere do human women,
p41
aVlike, where do women lay their eggs?"
p42
aa(lp43
VAnd I said, "Well,
p44
aVfunny you should ask. (Laughter)
p45
aVWe have evolved to have our own pond.
p46
aVWe have our very own pond inside our bodies.
p47
aVAnd we lay our eggs there,
p48
aVwe don't have to worry about other eggs or anything like that.
p49
aVIt's our own pond. And that's how it happens."
p50
aa(lp51
VAnd she goes, "Then how do they get fertilized?"
p52
aa(lp53
VAnd I said, "Well,
p54
aVMen, through their penis,
p55
aVthey fertilize the eggs by the sperm coming out.
p56
aVAnd you go through the woman's vagina."
p57
aa(lp58
VAnd so we're just eating, and her jaw just drops,
p59
aVand she goes, "Mom!
p60
aVLike, where you go to the bathroom?"
p61
aa(lp62
VAnd I said, "I know.
p63
aVI know."
p64
aV(Laughter)
p65
aVThat's how we evolved. It does seem odd.
p66
aVIt is a little bit like having a waste treatment plant
p67
aVright next to an amusement park ...
p68
aVBad zoning, but ..." (Laughter)
p69
aa(lp70
VShe's like, "What?" And she goes, "But Mom,
p71
aVbut men and women can't ever see each other naked, Mom.
p72
aVSo how could that ever happen?"
p73
aa(lp74
VAnd then I go, "Well," and then I put my Margaret Mead hat on.
p75
aV"Human males and females
p76
aVdevelop a special bond,
p77
aVand when they're much older, much, much older than you,
p78
aVand they have a very special feeling,
p79
aVthen they can be naked together."
p80
aa(lp81
VAnd she said, "Mom,
p82
aVhave you done this before?"
p83
aa(lp84
VAnd I said, "Yes."
p85
aa(lp86
VAnd she said, "But Mom, you can't have kids."
p87
aVBecause she knows that I adopted her and that I can't have kids.
p88
aa(lp89
VAnd I said, "Yes."
p90
aa(lp91
VAnd she said, "Well, you don't have to do that again."
p92
aa(lp93
VAnd I said, "..."
p94
aa(lp95
VAnd then she said, "But how does it happen when a man and woman are together?
p96
aVLike, how do they know that's the time?
p97
aVMom, does the man just say,
p98
aV'Is now the time to take off my pants?'"
p99
aa(lp100
V(Laughter)
p101
aa(lp102
VAnd I said, "Yes."
p103
aV(Laughter)
p104
aV"That is exactly right.
p105
aVThat's exactly how it happens."
p106
aa(lp107
VSo we're driving home and she's looking out the window, and she goes,
p108
aV"Mom. What if two just people saw each other on the street,
p109
aVlike a man and a woman, they just started doing it. Would that ever happen?"
p110
aa(lp111
VAnd I said, "Oh, no. Humans are so private.
p112
aVOh ..."
p113
aa(lp114
VAnd then she goes, "What if there was like a party,
p115
aVand there was just like a whole bunch of girls and a whole bunch of boys,
p116
aVand there was a bunch of men and women and they just started doing it, Mom?
p117
aVWould that ever happen?"
p118
aa(lp119
VAnd I said, "Oh, no, no.
p120
aVThat's not how we do it."
p121
aa(lp122
VThen we got home and we see the cat. And she goes,
p123
aV"Mom, how do cats do it?"
p124
aa(lp125
VAnd I go, "Oh, it's the same. It's basically the same."
p126
aa(lp127
VAnd then she got all caught up in the legs. "But how would the legs go, Mom?
p128
aVI don't understand the legs."
p129
aVShe goes, "Mom, everyone can't do the splits."
p130
aa(lp131
VAnd I go, "I know, but the legs ..."
p132
aVand I'm probably like, "The legs get worked out."
p133
aa(lp134
VAnd she goes, "But I just can't understand it."
p135
aa(lp136
VSo I go, "You know, why don't we go on the Internet,
p137
aVand maybe we can see ... like on Wikipedia." (Laughter)
p138
aa(lp139
VSo we go online, and we put in "cats mating."
p140
aVAnd, unfortunately, on YouTube, there's many cats mating videos.
p141
aVAnd we watched them and I'm so thankful,
p142
aVbecause she's just like, "Wow! This is so amazing."
p143
aVShe goes, "What about dogs?"
p144
aVSo we put in dogs mating, and,
p145
aVyou know, we're watching it, and she's totally absorbed.
p146
aa(lp147
VAnd then she goes, "Mom,
p148
aVdo you think they would have, on the Internet,
p149
aVany humans mating?"
p150
aV(Laughter)
p151
aVAnd then I realized that
p152
aVI had taken my little eight year old's hand,
p153
aVand taken her right into Internet porn. (Laughter)
p154
aa(lp155
VAnd I looked into this
p156
aVtrusting, loving face,
p157
aVand I said,
p158
aV"Oh, no.
p159
aVThat would never happen."
p160
aa(lp161
VThank you.
p162
aa(lp163
V(Applause)
p164
aa(lp165
VThank you.
p166
aa(lp167
V(Applause)
p168
aa(lp169
VThank you. I'm so happy to be here.
