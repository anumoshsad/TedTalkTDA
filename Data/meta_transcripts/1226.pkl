VLet's talk about billions.
p4
aVLet's talk about
p5
aVpast and future billions.
p6
aVWe know
p7
aVthat about 106 billion people
p8
aVhave ever lived.
p9
aVAnd we know that most of them are dead.
p10
aVAnd we also know
p11
aVthat most of them live or lived in Asia.
p12
aVAnd we also know
p13
aVthat most of them were or are very poor \u2014
p14
aVdid not live for very long.
p15
aVLet's talk about billions.
p16
aVLet's talk about
p17
aVthe 195,000 billion dollars of wealth
p18
aVin the world today.
p19
aVWe know that most of that wealth
p20
aVwas made after the year 1800.
p21
aVAnd we know that most of it
p22
aVis currently owned
p23
aVby people we might call Westerners:
p24
aVEuropeans, North Americans, Australasians.
p25
aV19 percent of the world's population today,
p26
aVWesterners own two-thirds of its wealth.
p27
aa(lp28
VEconomic historians
p29
aVcall this "The Great Divergence."
p30
aVAnd this slide here
p31
aVis the best simplification
p32
aVof the Great Divergence story
p33
aVI can offer you.
p34
aVIt's basically two ratios
p35
aVof per capita GDP,
p36
aVper capita gross domestic product,
p37
aVso average income.
p38
aVOne, the red line,
p39
aVis the ratio of British to Indian
p40
aVper capita income.
p41
aVAnd the blue line
p42
aVis the ratio of American to Chinese.
p43
aVAnd this chart goes back to 1500.
p44
aVAnd you can see here
p45
aVthat there's an exponential Great Divergence.
p46
aVThey start off pretty close together.
p47
aVIn fact, in 1500,
p48
aVthe average Chinese was richer than the average North American.
p49
aVWhen you get to the 1970s,
p50
aVwhich is where this chart ends,
p51
aVthe average Briton is more than 10 times richer
p52
aVthan the average Indian.
p53
aVAnd that's allowing
p54
aVfor differences in the cost of living.
p55
aVIt's based on purchasing power parity.
p56
aVThe average American
p57
aVis nearly 20 times richer
p58
aVthan the average Chinese
p59
aVby the 1970s.
p60
aa(lp61
VSo why?
p62
aVThis wasn't just an economic story.
p63
aVIf you take the 10 countries
p64
aVthat went on to become
p65
aVthe Western empires,
p66
aVin 1500 they were really quite tiny \u2014
p67
aVfive percent of the world's land surface,
p68
aV16 percent of its population,
p69
aVmaybe 20 percent of its income.
p70
aVBy 1913,
p71
aVthese 10 countries, plus the United States,
p72
aVcontrolled vast global empires \u2014
p73
aV58 percent of the world's territory,
p74
aVabout the same percentage of its population,
p75
aVand a really huge, nearly three-quarters share
p76
aVof global economic output.
p77
aVAnd notice, most of that went to the motherland,
p78
aVto the imperial metropoles,
p79
aVnot to their colonial possessions.
p80
aa(lp81
VNow you can't just blame this on imperialism \u2014
p82
aVthough many people have tried to do so \u2014
p83
aVfor two reasons.
p84
aVOne, empire was the least original thing
p85
aVthat the West did after 1500.
p86
aVEverybody did empire.
p87
aVThey beat preexisting Oriental empires
p88
aVlike the Mughals and the Ottomans.
p89
aVSo it really doesn't look like empire is a great explanation
p90
aVfor the Great Divergence.
p91
aVIn any case, as you may remember,
p92
aVthe Great Divergence reaches its zenith in the 1970s,
p93
aVsome considerable time after decolonization.
p94
aVThis is not a new question.
p95
aa(lp96
VSamuel Johnson,
p97
aVthe great lexicographer,
p98
aV[posed] it through his character Rasselas
p99
aVin his novel "Rasselas, Prince of Abissinia,"
p100
aVpublished in 1759.
p101
aV"By what means are the Europeans thus powerful;
p102
aVor why, since they can so easily visit Asia and Africa
p103
aVfor trade or conquest,
p104
aVcannot the Asiaticks and Africans
p105
aVinvade their coasts,
p106
aVplant colonies in their ports,
p107
aVand give laws to their natural princes?
p108
aVThe same wind that carries them back
p109
aVwould bring us thither?"
p110
aa(lp111
VThat's a great question.
p112
aVAnd you know what,
p113
aVit was also being asked at roughly the same time
p114
aVby the Resterners \u2014 by the people in the rest of the world \u2014
p115
aVlike Ibrahim Muteferrika,
p116
aVan Ottoman official,
p117
aVthe man who introduced printing, very belatedly,
p118
aVto the Ottoman Empire \u2014
p119
aVwho said in a book published in 1731,
p120
aV"Why do Christian nations which were so weak in the past
p121
aVcompared with Muslim nations
p122
aVbegin to dominate so many lands in modern times
p123
aVand even defeat the once victorious Ottoman armies?"
p124
aVUnlike Rasselas,
p125
aVMuteferrika had an answer to that question,
p126
aVwhich was correct.
p127
aVHe said it was "because they have laws and rules
p128
aVinvented by reason."
p129
aVIt's not geography.
p130
aa(lp131
VYou may think we can explain the Great Divergence
p132
aVin terms of geography.
p133
aVWe know that's wrong,
p134
aVbecause we conducted two great natural experiments in the 20th century
p135
aVto see if geography mattered more than institutions.
p136
aVWe took all the Germans,
p137
aVwe divided them roughly in two,
p138
aVand we gave the ones in the East communism,
p139
aVand you see the result.
p140
aVWithin an incredibly short period of time,
p141
aVpeople living in the German Democratic Republic
p142
aVproduced Trabants, the Trabbi,
p143
aVone of the world's worst ever cars,
p144
aVwhile people in the West produced the Mercedes Benz.
p145
aVIf you still don't believe me,
p146
aVwe conducted the experiment also in the Korean Peninsula.
p147
aVAnd we decided we'd take Koreans
p148
aVin roughly the same geographical place
p149
aVwith, notice, the same basic traditional culture,
p150
aVand we divided them in two, and we gave the Northerners communism.
p151
aVAnd the result is an even bigger divergence
p152
aVin a very short space of time
p153
aVthan happened in Germany.
p154
aVNot a big divergence in terms of uniform design for border guards admittedly,
p155
aVbut in almost every other respect,
p156
aVit's a huge divergence.
p157
aVWhich leads me to think
p158
aVthat neither geography nor national character,
p159
aVpopular explanations for this kind of thing,
p160
aVare really significant.
p161
aa(lp162
VIt's the ideas.
p163
aVIt's the institutions.
p164
aVThis must be true
p165
aVbecause a Scotsman said it.
p166
aVAnd I think I'm the only Scotsman here at the Edinburgh TED.
p167
aVSo let me just explain to you
p168
aVthat the smartest man ever was a Scotsman.
p169
aVHe was Adam Smith \u2014
p170
aVnot Billy Connolly, not Sean Connery \u2014
p171
aVthough he is very smart indeed.
p172
aV(Laughter)
p173
aVSmith \u2014 and I want you to go
p174
aVand bow down before his statue in the Royal Mile;
p175
aVit's a wonderful statue \u2014
p176
aVSmith, in the "Wealth of Nations"
p177
aVpublished in 1776 \u2014
p178
aVthat's the most important thing that happened that year ...
p179
aV(Laughter)
p180
aVYou bet.
p181
aVThere was a little local difficulty in some of our minor colonies, but ...
p182
aa(lp183
V(Laughter)
p184
aa(lp185
V"China seems to have been long stationary,
p186
aVand probably long ago acquired that full complement of riches
p187
aVwhich is consistent with the nature of its laws and institutions.
p188
aVBut this complement may be much inferior
p189
aVto what, with other laws and institutions,
p190
aVthe nature of its soil, climate, and situation
p191
aVmight admit of."
p192
aVThat is so right and so cool.
p193
aVAnd he said it such a long time ago.
p194
aa(lp195
VBut you know, this is a TED audience,
p196
aVand if I keep talking about institutions,
p197
aVyou're going to turn off.
p198
aVSo I'm going to translate this into language that you can understand.
p199
aVLet's call them the killer apps.
p200
aVI want to explain to you that there were six killer apps
p201
aVthat set the West apart from the rest.
p202
aVAnd they're kind of like the apps on your phone,
p203
aVin the sense that they look quite simple.
p204
aVThey're just icons; you click on them.
p205
aVBut behind the icon, there's complex code.
p206
aVIt's the same with institutions.
p207
aVThere are six
p208
aVwhich I think explain the Great Divergence.
p209
aVOne, competition.
p210
aVTwo, the scientific revolution.
p211
aVThree, property rights.
p212
aVFour, modern medicine.
p213
aVFive, the consumer society.
p214
aVAnd six, the work ethic.
p215
aVYou can play a game and try and think of one I've missed at,
p216
aVor try and boil it down to just four,
p217
aVbut you'll lose.
p218
aa(lp219
V(Laughter)
p220
aa(lp221
VLet me very briefly tell you what I mean by this,
p222
aVsynthesizing the work of many economic historians
p223
aVin the process.
p224
aVCompetition means,
p225
aVnot only were there a hundred different political units in Europe in 1500,
p226
aVbut within each of these units,
p227
aVthere was competition between corporations as well as sovereigns.
p228
aVThe ancestor of the modern corporation, the City of London Corporation,
p229
aVexisted in the 12th century.
p230
aVNothing like this existed in China,
p231
aVwhere there was one monolithic state
p232
aVcovering a fifth of humanity,
p233
aVand anyone with any ambition
p234
aVhad to pass one standardized examination,
p235
aVwhich took three days and was very difficult
p236
aVand involved memorizing vast numbers of characters
p237
aVand very complex Confucian essay writing.
p238
aa(lp239
VThe scientific revolution was different
p240
aVfrom the science that had been achieved in the Oriental world
p241
aVin a number of crucial ways,
p242
aVthe most important being
p243
aVthat, through the experimental method,
p244
aVit gave men control over nature in a way that had not been possible before.
p245
aVExample: Benjamin Robins's extraordinary application
p246
aVof Newtonian physics to ballistics.
p247
aVOnce you do that,
p248
aVyour artillery becomes accurate.
p249
aVThink of what that means.
p250
aVThat really was a killer application.
p251
aV(Laughter)
p252
aVMeanwhile, there's no scientific revolution anywhere else.
p253
aVThe Ottoman Empire's not that far from Europe,
p254
aVbut there's no scientific revolution there.
p255
aVIn fact, they demolish Taqi al-Din's observatory,
p256
aVbecause it's considered blasphemous
p257
aVto inquire into the mind of God.
p258
aa(lp259
VProperty rights: It's not the democracy, folks;
p260
aVit's having the rule of law based on private property rights.
p261
aVThat's what makes the difference
p262
aVbetween North America and South America.
p263
aVYou could turn up in North America
p264
aVhaving signed a deed of indenture
p265
aVsaying, "I'll work for nothing for five years.
p266
aVYou just have to feed me."
p267
aVBut at the end of it, you've got a hundred acres of land.
p268
aVThat's the land grant
p269
aVon the bottom half of the slide.
p270
aVThat's not possible in Latin America
p271
aVwhere land is held onto
p272
aVby a tiny elite descended from the conquistadors.
p273
aVAnd you can see here the huge divergence
p274
aVthat happens in property ownership between North and South.
p275
aVMost people in rural North America
p276
aVowned some land by 1900.
p277
aVHardly anyone in South America did.
p278
aVThat's another killer app.
p279
aa(lp280
VModern medicine in the late 19th century
p281
aVbegan to make major breakthroughs
p282
aVagainst the infectious diseases that killed a lot of people.
p283
aVAnd this was another killer app \u2014
p284
aVthe very opposite of a killer,
p285
aVbecause it doubled, and then more than doubled, human life expectancy.
p286
aVIt even did that
p287
aVin the European empires.
p288
aVEven in places like Senegal,
p289
aVbeginning in the early 20th century,
p290
aVthere were major breakthroughs in public health,
p291
aVand life expectancy began to rise.
p292
aVIt doesn't rise any faster
p293
aVafter these countries become independent.
p294
aVThe empires weren't all bad.
p295
aa(lp296
VThe consumer society is what you need
p297
aVfor the Industrial Revolution to have a point.
p298
aVYou need people to want to wear tons of clothes.
p299
aVYou've all bought an article of clothing in the last month;
p300
aVI guarantee it.
p301
aVThat's the consumer society,
p302
aVand it propels economic growth
p303
aVmore than even technological change itself.
p304
aVJapan was the first non-Western society
p305
aVto embrace it.
p306
aVThe alternative,
p307
aVwhich was proposed by Mahatma Gandhi,
p308
aVwas to institutionalize and make poverty permanent.
p309
aVVery few Indians today
p310
aVwish that India had gone down
p311
aVMahatma Gandhi's road.
p312
aa(lp313
VFinally, the work ethic.
p314
aVMax Weber thought that was peculiarly Protestant.
p315
aVHe was wrong.
p316
aVAny culture can get the work ethic
p317
aVif the institutions are there
p318
aVto create the incentive to work.
p319
aVWe know this
p320
aVbecause today the work ethic
p321
aVis no longer a Protestant, Western phenomenon.
p322
aVIn fact, the West has lost its work ethic.
p323
aVToday, the average Korean
p324
aVworks a thousand hours more a year
p325
aVthan the average German \u2014
p326
aVa thousand.
p327
aVAnd this is part
p328
aVof a really extraordinary phenomenon,
p329
aVand that is the end of the Great Divergence.
p330
aa(lp331
VWho's got the work ethic now?
p332
aVTake a look at mathematical attainment
p333
aVby 15 year-olds.
p334
aVAt the top of the international league table
p335
aVaccording to the latest PISA study,
p336
aVis the Shanghai district of China.
p337
aVThe gap between Shanghai
p338
aVand the United Kingdom and the United States
p339
aVis as big as the gap between the U.K. and the U.S.
p340
aVand Albania and Tunisia.
p341
aVYou probably assume
p342
aVthat because the iPhone was designed in California
p343
aVbut assembled in China
p344
aVthat the West still leads in terms of technological innovation.
p345
aVYou're wrong.
p346
aVIn terms of patents,
p347
aVthere's no question that the East is ahead.
p348
aVNot only has Japan been ahead for some time,
p349
aVSouth Korea has gone into third place,
p350
aVand China is just about to overtake Germany.
p351
aVWhy?
p352
aVBecause the killer apps can be downloaded.
p353
aVIt's open source.
p354
aVAny society can adopt these institutions,
p355
aVand when they do,
p356
aVthey achieve what the West achieved after 1500 \u2014
p357
aVonly faster.
p358
aa(lp359
VThis is the Great Reconvergence,
p360
aVand it's the biggest story of your lifetime.
p361
aVBecause it's on your watch that this is happening.
p362
aVIt's our generation
p363
aVthat is witnessing the end of Western predominance.
p364
aVThe average American used to be more than 20 times richer
p365
aVthan the average Chinese.
p366
aVNow it's just five times,
p367
aVand soon it will be 2.5 times.
p368
aa(lp369
VSo I want to end with three questions
p370
aVfor the future billions,
p371
aVjust ahead of 2016,
p372
aVwhen the United States will lose its place
p373
aVas number one economy to China.
p374
aVThe first is, can you delete these apps,
p375
aVand are we in the process of doing so
p376
aVin the Western world?
p377
aVThe second question is,
p378
aVdoes the sequencing of the download matter?
p379
aVAnd could Africa get that sequencing wrong?
p380
aVOne obvious implication of modern economic history
p381
aVis that it's quite hard to transition to democracy
p382
aVbefore you've established
p383
aVsecure private property rights.
p384
aVWarning: that may not work.
p385
aVAnd third, can China do without
p386
aVkiller app number three?
p387
aVThat's the one that John Locke systematized
p388
aVwhen he said that freedom was rooted in private property rights
p389
aVand the protection of law.
p390
aVThat's the basis
p391
aVfor the Western model
p392
aVof representative government.
p393
aVNow this picture shows the demolition
p394
aVof the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei's studio
p395
aVin Shanghai earlier this year.
p396
aVHe's now free again,
p397
aVhaving been detained, as you know, for some time.
p398
aVBut I don't think his studio has been rebuilt.
p399
aa(lp400
VWinston Churchill once defined civilization
p401
aVin a lecture he gave in the fateful year of 1938.
p402
aVAnd I think these words really nail it:
p403
aV"It means a society based upon the opinion of civilians.
p404
aVIt means that violence, the rule of warriors and despotic chiefs,
p405
aVthe conditions of camps and warfare, of riot and tyranny,
p406
aVgive place to parliaments where laws are made,
p407
aVand independent courts of justice
p408
aVin which over long periods those laws are maintained.
p409
aVThat is civilization \u2014
p410
aVand in its soil grow continually
p411
aVfreedom, comfort and culture,"
p412
aVwhat all TEDsters care about most.
p413
aV"When civilization reigns in any country,
p414
aVa wider and less harassed life
p415
aVis afforded to the masses of the people."
p416
aVThat's so true.
p417
aa(lp418
VI don't think the decline of Western civilization
p419
aVis inevitable,
p420
aVbecause I don't think history operates
p421
aVin this kind of life-cycle model,
p422
aVbeautifully illustrated by Thomas Cole's
p423
aV"Course of Empire" paintings.
p424
aVThat's not the way history works.
p425
aVThat's not the way the West rose,
p426
aVand I don't think it's the way the West will fall.
p427
aVThe West may collapse very suddenly.
p428
aVComplex civilizations do that,
p429
aVbecause they operate, most of the time,
p430
aVon the edge of chaos.
p431
aVThat's one of the most profound insights
p432
aVto come out of the historical study of complex institutions
p433
aVlike civilizations.
p434
aVNo, we may hang on,
p435
aVdespite the huge burdens of debt that we've accumulated,
p436
aVdespite the evidence that we've lost our work ethic
p437
aVand other parts of our historical mojo.
p438
aVBut one thing is for sure,
p439
aVthe Great Divergence
p440
aVis over, folks.
p441
aa(lp442
VThanks very much.
p443
aa(lp444
V(Applause)
p445
aa(lp446
VBruno Giussani: Niall,
p447
aVI am just curious
p448
aVabout your take on the other region of the world that's booming,
p449
aVwhich is Latin America.
p450
aVWhat's your view on that?
p451
aa(lp452
VNiall Ferguson: Well I really am not just talking
p453
aVabout the rise of the East;
p454
aVI'm talking about the rise of the Rest,
p455
aVand that includes South America.
p456
aVI once asked one of my colleagues at Harvard,
p457
aV"Hey, is South America part of the West?"
p458
aVHe was an expert in Latin American history.
p459
aVHe said, "I don't know; I'll have to think about that."
p460
aVThat tells you something really important.
p461
aVI think if you look at what is happening in Brazil in particular,
p462
aVbut also Chile,
p463
aVwhich was in many ways the one that led the way
p464
aVin transforming the institutions of economic life,
p465
aVthere's a very bright future indeed.
p466
aVSo my story really is
p467
aVas much about that convergence in the Americas
p468
aVas it's a convergence story in Eurasia.
p469
aa(lp470
VBG: And there is this impression
p471
aVthat North America and Europe
p472
aVare not really paying attention
p473
aVto these trends.
p474
aVMostly they're worried about each other.
p475
aVThe Americans think that the European model is going to crumble tomorrow.
p476
aVThe Europeans think that the American budget is going to explode tomorrow.
p477
aVAnd that's all we seem to be caring about recently.
p478
aa(lp479
VNF: I think the fiscal crisis
p480
aVthat we see in the developed World right now \u2014 both sides of the Atlantic \u2014
p481
aVis essentially the same thing
p482
