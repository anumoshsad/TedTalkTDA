VThis may sound strange,
p4
aVbut I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
p5
aVThe first concrete blocks were manufactured in 1868
p6
aVwith a very simple idea:
p7
aVmodules made of cement of a fixed measurement
p8
aVthat fit together.
p9
aVVery quickly concrete blocks became
p10
aVthe most-used construction unit in the world.
p11
aVThey enabled us to to build things that were larger than us,
p12
aVbuildings, bridges,
p13
aVone brick at a time.
p14
aVEssentially concrete blocks had become
p15
aVthe building block of our time.
p16
aa(lp17
VAlmost a hundred years later in 1947,
p18
aVLEGO came up with this.
p19
aVIt was called the Automatic Binding Brick.
p20
aVAnd in a few short years,
p21
aVLEGO bricks took place in every household.
p22
aVIt's estimated that over 400 billion bricks have been produced \u2014
p23
aVor 75 bricks for every person on the planet.
p24
aVYou don't have to be an engineer
p25
aVto make beautiful houses, beautiful bridges, beautiful buildings.
p26
aVLEGO made it accessible.
p27
aVLEGO has essentially taken the concrete block, the building block of the world,
p28
aVand made it into the building block
p29
aVof our imagination.
p30
aa(lp31
VMeanwhile the exact same year,
p32
aVat Bell Labs the next revolution was about to be announced,
p33
aVthe next building block.
p34
aVThe transistor was a small plastic unit
p35
aVthat would take us from a world
p36
aVof static bricks piled on top of each other
p37
aVto a world where everything was interactive.
p38
aVLike the concrete block,
p39
aVthe transistor allows you to build
p40
aVmuch larger, more complex circuits, one brick at a time.
p41
aa(lp42
VBut there's a main difference:
p43
aVThe transistor was only for experts.
p44
aVI personally don't accept this,
p45
aVthat the building block of our time
p46
aVis reserved for experts,
p47
aVso I decided to change that.
p48
aVEight years ago when I was at the Media Lab,
p49
aVI started exploring this idea
p50
aVof how to put the power of engineers
p51
aVin the hands of artists and designers.
p52
aa(lp53
VA few years ago I started developing littleBits.
p54
aVLet me show you how they work.
p55
aVLittleBits are electronic modules
p56
aVwith each one specific function.
p57
aVThey're pre-engineered
p58
aVto be light, sound,
p59
aVmotors and sensors.
p60
aVAnd the best part about it
p61
aVis they snap together with magnets.
p62
aVSo you can't put them the wrong way.
p63
aVThe bricks are color-coded.
p64
aVGreen is output, blue is power,
p65
aVpink is input and orange is wire.
p66
aVSo all you need to do is snap a blue to a green
p67
aVand very quickly you can start making larger circuits.
p68
aVYou put a blue to a green,
p69
aVyou can make light.
p70
aVYou can put a knob in between
p71
aVand now you've made a little dimmer.
p72
aVSwitch out the knob
p73
aVfor a pulse module,
p74
aVwhich is here,
p75
aVand now you've made a little blinker.
p76
aVAdd this buzzer
p77
aVfor some extra punch
p78
aVand you've created a noise machine.
p79
aVI'm going to stop that.
p80
aa(lp81
VSo beyond simple play,
p82
aVlittleBits are actually pretty powerful.
p83
aVInstead of having to program, to wire, to solder,
p84
aVlittleBits allow you to program
p85
aVusing very simple intuitive gestures.
p86
aVSo to make this blink faster or slower,
p87
aVyou would just turn this knob
p88
aVand basically make it pulse faster or slower.
p89
aVThe idea behind littleBits
p90
aVis that it's a growing library.
p91
aVWe want to make every single interaction in the world
p92
aVinto a ready-to-use brick.
p93
aVLights, sounds, solar panels, motors \u2014
p94
aVeverything should be accessible.
p95
aa(lp96
VWe've been giving littleBits to kids and seeing them play with them.
p97
aVAnd it's been an incredible experience.
p98
aVThe nicest thing is how they start to understand
p99
aVthe electronics around them from everyday
p100
aVthat they don't learn at schools.
p101
aVFor example, how a nightlight works,
p102
aVor why an elevator door stays open,
p103
aVor how an iPod responds to touch.
p104
aVWe've also been taking littleBits to design schools.
p105
aVSo for example, we've had designers
p106
aVwith no experience with electronics whatsoever
p107
aVstart to play with littleBits as a material.
p108
aVHere you see, with felt and paper water bottles,
p109
aVwe have Geordie making ...

aa(lp115
VA few weeks ago we took littleBits to RISD
p116
aVand gave them to some designers
p117
aVwith no experience in engineering whatsoever \u2014
p118
aVjust cardboard, wood and paper \u2014 and told them "Make something."
p119
aVHere's an example of a project they made,
p120
aVa motion-activated confetti canon ball.
p121
aV(Laughter)
p122
aVBut wait, this is actually my favorite project.
p123
aVIt's a lobster made of playdough
p124
aVthat's afraid of the dark.
p125
aa(lp126
V(Laughter)
p127
aa(lp128
VTo these non-engineers, littleBits became another material,
p129
aVelectronics became just another material.
p130
aVAnd we want to make this material accessible to everyone.
p131
aVSo littleBits is open-source.
p132
aVYou can go on the website, download all the design files, make them yourself.
p133
aVWe want to encourage a world
p134
aVof creators, of inventors, of contributors,
p135
aVbecause this world that we live in,
p136
aVthis interactive world, is ours.
p137
aVSo go ahead and start inventing.
