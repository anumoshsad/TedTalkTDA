VAs a culture, we tell ourselves lots of stories
p4
aVabout the future,
p5
aVand where we might move forward from this point.
p6
aVSome of those stories are that
p7
aVsomebody is just going to sort everything out for us.
p8
aVOther stories are that everything is on the verge of unraveling.
p9
aa(lp10
VBut I want to tell you a different story here today.
p11
aVLike all stories, it has a beginning.
p12
aVMy work, for a long time, has been involved in education,
p13
aVin teaching people practical skills
p14
aVfor sustainability,
p15
aVteaching people how to take responsibility
p16
aVfor growing some of their own food,
p17
aVhow to build buildings using local materials,
p18
aVhow to generate their own energy, and so on.
p19
aa(lp20
VI lived in Ireland, built the first straw-bale houses in Ireland,
p21
aVand some cob buildings and all this kind of thing.
p22
aVBut all my work for many years was focused
p23
aVaround the idea that sustainability
p24
aVmeans basically looking at
p25
aVthe globalized economic growth model,
p26
aVand moderating what comes in at one end,
p27
aVand moderating the outputs at the other end.
p28
aVAnd then I came into contact with a way of looking at things
p29
aVwhich actually changed that profoundly.
p30
aa(lp31
VAnd in order to introduce you to that,
p32
aVI've got something here that I'm going to unveil,
p33
aVwhich is one of the great marvels of the modern age.
p34
aVAnd it's something so astounding and so astonishing
p35
aVthat I think maybe as I remove this cloth
p36
aVa suitable gasp of amazement might be appropriate.
p37
aVIf you could help me with that it would be fantastic.
p38
aV(Laughter)
p39
aVThis is a liter of oil.
p40
aa(lp41
VThis bottle of oil,
p42
aVdistilled over a hundred million years of geological time,
p43
aVancient sunlight,
p44
aVcontains the energy equivalent of about five weeks
p45
aVhard human manual labor \u2014
p46
aVequivalent to about 35 strong people
p47
aVcoming round and working for you.
p48
aVWe can turn it into a dazzling array of materials,
p49
aVmedicine, modern clothing,
p50
aVlaptops, a whole range of different things.
p51
aVIt gives us an energy return that's unimaginable, historically.
p52
aVWe've based the design of our settlements,
p53
aVour business models, our transport plans,
p54
aVeven the idea of economic growth, some would argue,
p55
aVon the assumption that we will have this in perpetuity.
p56
aa(lp57
VYet, when we take a step back,
p58
aVand look over the span of history,
p59
aVat what we might call the petroleum interval,
p60
aVit's a short period in history
p61
aVwhere we've discovered this extraordinary material,
p62
aVand then based a whole way of life around it.
p63
aVBut as we straddle the top of this energy mountain, at this stage,
p64
aVwe move from a time where our economic success,
p65
aVour sense of individual prowess and well-being
p66
aVis directly linked to how much of this we consume,
p67
aVto a time when actually our degree of oil dependency
p68
aVis our degree of vulnerability.
p69
aa(lp70
VAnd it's increasingly clear that we
p71
aVaren't going to be able to rely on the fact that
p72
aVwe're going to have this at our disposal forever.
p73
aVFor every four barrels of oil that we consume,
p74
aVwe only discover one.
p75
aVAnd that gap continues to widen.
p76
aVThere is also the fact that the amount of energy
p77
aVthat we get back from the oil that we discover is falling.
p78
aVIn the 1930s we got 100 units of energy back
p79
aVfor every one that we put in to extract it.
p80
aVCompletely unprecedented, historically.
p81
aVAlready that's fallen to about 11.
p82
aVAnd that's why, now,
p83
aVthe new breakthroughs, the new frontiers
p84
aVin terms of oil extraction are scrambling about in Alberta,
p85
aVor at the bottom of the oceans.
p86
aa(lp87
VThere are 98 oil-producing nations in the world.
p88
aVBut of those, 65 have already passed their peak.
p89
aVThe moment when the world on average passes this peak,
p90
aVpeople wonder when that's going to happen.
p91
aVAnd there is an emerging case
p92
aVthat maybe that was what happened last July
p93
aVwhen the oil prices were so high.
p94
aa(lp95
VBut are we to assume that the same brilliance
p96
aVand creativity and adaptability
p97
aVthat got us up to the top of that energy mountain in the first place
p98
aVis somehow mysteriously going to evaporate
p99
aVwhen we have to design a creative way back down the other side?
p100
aVNo. But the thinking that we have to come up with
p101
aVhas to be based on a realistic assessment
p102
aVof where we are.
p103
aa(lp104
VThere is also the issue of climate change,
p105
aVis the other thing that underpins this transition approach.
p106
aVBut the thing that I notice, as I talk to climate scientists,
p107
aVis the increasingly terrified look they have in their eyes,
p108
aVas the data that's coming in,
p109
aVwhich is far ahead of what the IPCC are talking about.
p110
aVSo the IPCC said
p111
aVthat we might see significant breakup
p112
aVof the arctic ice in 2100, in their worst case scenario.
p113
aVActually, if current trends continue,
p114
aVit could all be gone in five or 10 years' time.
p115
aVIf just three percent of the carbon locked up in the arctic permafrost
p116
aVis released as the world warms,
p117
aVit would offset all the savings that we need to make,
p118
aVin carbon, over the next 40 years to avoid runaway climate change.
p119
aVWe have no choice other than deep and urgent decarbonization.
p120
aa(lp121
VBut I'm always very interested to think about
p122
aVwhat might the stories be
p123
aVthat the generations further down the slope from us
p124
aVare going to tell about us.
p125
aV"The generation that lived at the top of the mountain,
p126
aVthat partied so hard, and so abused its inheritance."
p127
aVAnd one of the ways I like to do that
p128
aVis to look back at the stories people used to tell
p129
aVbefore we had cheap oil, before we had fossil fuels,
p130
aVand people relied on their own muscle, animal muscle energy,
p131
aVor a little bit of wind, little bit of water energy.
p132
aa(lp133
VWe had stories like "The Seven-League Boots":
p134
aVthe giant who had these boots, where, once you put them on,
p135
aVwith every stride you could cover seven leagues, or 21 miles,
p136
aVa kind of travel completely unimaginable
p137
aVto people without that kind of energy at their disposal.
p138
aa(lp139
VStories like The Magic Porridge Pot,
p140
aVwhere you had a pot where if you knew the magic words,
p141
aVthis pot would just make as much food as you liked,
p142
aVwithout you having to do any work,
p143
aVprovided you could remember the other magic word to stop it making porridge.
p144
aVOtherwise you'd flood your entire town with warm porridge.
p145
aa(lp146
VThere is the story of "The Elves and the Shoemaker."
p147
aVThe people who make shoes go to sleep, wake up in the morning,
p148
aVand all the shoes are magically made for them.
p149
aVIt's something that was unimaginable to people then.
p150
aa(lp151
VNow we have the seven-league boots
p152
aVin the form of Ryanair and Easyjet.
p153
aVWe have the magic porridge pot
p154
aVin the form of Walmart and Tesco.
p155
aVAnd we have the elves in the form of China.
p156
aVBut we don't appreciate what an astonishing
p157
aVthing that has been.
p158
aa(lp159
VAnd what are the stories that we tell ourselves now,
p160
aVas we look forward about where we're going to go.
p161
aVAnd I would argue that there are four. There is the idea of business as usual,
p162
aVthat the future will be like the present, just more of it.
p163
aVBut as we've seen over the last year, I think that's an idea
p164
aVthat is increasingly coming into question.
p165
aVAnd in terms of climate change,
p166
aVis something that is not actually feasible.
p167
aa(lp168
VThere is the idea of hitting the wall,
p169
aVthat actually somehow everything is so fragile
p170
aVthat it might just all unravel and collapse.
p171
aVThis is a popular story in some places.
p172
aVThe third story is the idea that technology can solve everything,
p173
aVthat technology can somehow get us through this completely.
p174
aa(lp175
VAnd it's an idea that I think is very prevalent at these TED Talks,
p176
aVthe idea that we can invent our way out of a profound
p177
aVeconomic and energy crisis,
p178
aVthat a move to a knowledge economy
p179
aVcan somehow neatly sidestep those energy constraints,
p180
aVthe idea that we'll discover some fabulous new source of energy
p181
aVthat will mean we can sweep all concerns
p182
aVabout energy security to one side,
p183
aVthe idea that we can step off neatly
p184
aVonto a completely renewable world.
p185
aa(lp186
VBut the world isn't Second Life.
p187
aVWe can't create new land and new energy systems at the click of a mouse.
p188
aVAnd as we sit, exchanging free ideas with each other,
p189
aVthere are still people mining coal
p190
aVin order to power the servers, extracting the minerals
p191
aVto make all of those things.
p192
aVThe breakfast that we eat as we sit down
p193
aVto check our email in the morning
p194
aVis still transported at great distances,
p195
aVusually at the expense of the local, more resilient
p196
aVfood systems that would have supplied that in the past,
p197
aVwhich we've so effectively devalued and dismantled.
p198
aa(lp199
VWe can be astonishingly inventive and creative.
p200
aVBut we also live in a world with very real constraints and demands.
p201
aVEnergy and technology are not the same thing.
p202
aVWhat I'm involved with is the transition response.
p203
aVAnd this is really about looking the challenges
p204
aVof peak oil and climate change square in the face,
p205
aVand responding with a creativity and an adaptability
p206
aVand an imagination that we really need.
p207
aVIt's something which has spread incredibly fast.
p208
aVAnd it is something which has several characteristics.
p209
aa(lp210
VIt's viral. It seems to spread under the radar very, very quickly.
p211
aVIt's open source. It's something which everybody who's involved with it
p212
aVdevelops and passes on as they work with it.
p213
aVIt's self-organizing. There is no great central organization
p214
aVthat pushes this; people just pick up an idea
p215
aVand they run with it, and they implement it where they are.
p216
aVIt's solutions-focused. It's very much looking at what people can do
p217
aVwhere they are, to respond to this.
p218
aVIt's sensitive to place and to scale.
p219
aa(lp220
VTransitional is completely different.
p221
aVTransition groups in Chile, transition groups in the U.S., transition groups here,
p222
aVwhat they're doing looks very different in every place that you go to.
p223
aVIt learns very much from its mistakes.
p224
aVAnd it feels historic. It tries to create a sense
p225
aVthat this is a historic opportunity
p226
aVto do something really extraordinary.
p227
aVAnd it's a process which is really joyful.
p228
aVPeople have a huge amount of fun doing this,
p229
aVreconnecting with other people as they do it.
p230
aVOne of the things that underpins it is this idea of resilience.
p231
aa(lp232
VAnd I think, in many ways, the idea of resilience
p233
aVis a more useful concept than the idea of sustainability.
p234
aVThe idea of resilience comes from the study of ecology.
p235
aVAnd it's really about how systems,
p236
aVsettlements, withstand shock from the outside.
p237
aVWhen they encounter shock from the outside
p238
aVthat they don't just unravel and fall to pieces.
p239
aVAnd I think it's a more useful concept than sustainability, as I said.
p240
aa(lp241
VWhen our supermarkets have only two or three days' worth of food in them
p242
aVat any one time, often sustainability tends to focus on
p243
aVthe energy efficiency of the freezers
p244
aVand on the packaging that the lettuces are wrapped up in.
p245
aVLooking through the lens of resilience,
p246
aVwe really question how we've let ourselves get into a situation
p247
aVthat's so vulnerable.
p248
aVResilience runs much deeper:
p249
aVit's about building modularity into what we do,
p250
aVbuilding surge breakers into how we organize the basic things that support us.
p251
aa(lp252
VThis is a photograph of the Bristol and District
p253
aVMarket Gardeners Association, in 1897.
p254
aVThis is at a time when the city of Bristol,
p255
aVwhich is quite close to here,
p256
aVwas surrounded by commercial market gardens,
p257
aVwhich provided a significant amount of the food
p258
aVthat was consumed in the town, and created a lot of employment for people, as well.
p259
aVThere was a degree of resilience, if you like, at that time,
p260
aVwhich we can now only look back on with envy.
p261
aa(lp262
VSo how does this transition idea work?
p263
aVSo basically, you have a group of people who are excited by the idea.
p264
aVThey pick up some of the tools that we've developed.
p265
aVThey start to run an awareness-raising program
p266
aVlooking at how this might actually work in the town.
p267
aVThey show films, they give talks, and so on.
p268
aVIt's a process which is playful and creative
p269
aVand informative.
p270
aVThen they start to form working groups, looking at different aspects of this,
p271
aVand then from that, there emerge a whole lot of projects
p272
aVwhich then the transition project itself
p273
aVstarts to support and enable.
p274
aa(lp275
VSo it started out with some work I was involved in in Ireland,
p276
aVwhere I was teaching, and has since spread.
p277
aVThere are now over 200 formal transition projects.
p278
aVAnd there are thousands of others who are at what we call the mulling stage.
p279
aVThey are mulling whether they're going to take it further.
p280
aVAnd actually a lot of them are doing huge amounts of stuff.
p281
aVBut what do they actually do? You know, it's a kind of nice idea,
p282
aVbut what do they actually do on the ground?
p283
aa(lp284
VWell, I think it's really important to make the point that actually
p285
aVyou know, this isn't something which is going to do everything on its own.
p286
aVWe need international legislation from Copenhagen and so on.
p287
aVWe need national responses. We need local government responses.
p288
aVBut all of those things are going to be much easier
p289
aVif we have communities that are vibrant and coming up with ideas
p290
aVand leading from the front, making unelectable policies electable,
p291
aVover the next 5 to 10 years.
p292
aa(lp293
VSome of the things that emerge from it are local food projects,
p294
aVlike community-supported agriculture schemes,
p295
aVurban food production, creating local food directories, and so on.
p296
aVA lot of places now are starting to set up their own energy companies,
p297
aVcommunity-owned energy companies,
p298
aVwhere the community can invest money into itself,
p299
aVto start putting in place
p300
aVthe kind of renewable energy infrastructure that we need.
p301
aVA lot of places are working with their local schools.
p302
aVNewent in the Forest of Dean: big polytunnel they built for the school;
p303
aVthe kids are learning how to grow food.
p304
aVPromoting recycling, things like garden-share,
p305
aVthat matches up people who don't have a garden
p306
aVwho would like to grow food, with people who have gardens they aren't using anymore.
p307
aVPlanting productive trees throughout urban spaces.
p308
aVAnd also starting to play around with the idea of
p309
aValternative currencies.
p310
aa(lp311
VThis is Lewes in Sussex,
p312
aVwho have recently launched the Lewes Pound,
p313
aVa currency that you can only spend within the town,
p314
aVas a way of starting to cycle money within the local economy.
p315
aVYou take it anywhere else, it's not worth anything.
p316
aVBut actually within the town you start to create these economic
p317
aVcycles much more effectively.
p318
aa(lp319
VAnother thing that they do is what we call an energy descent plan,
p320
aVwhich is basically to develop a plan B for the town.
p321
aVMost of our local authorities, when they sit down to plan
p322
aVfor the next five, 10, 15, 20 years of a community,
p323
aVstill start by assuming that there will be more energy,
p324
aVmore cars, more housing,
p325
aVmore jobs, more growth, and so on.
p326
aVWhat does it look like if that's not the case? And how can we embrace that
p327
aVand actually come up with something that was actually more likely
p328
aVto sustain everybody?
p329
aVAs a friend of mine says, "Life is a series of things you're not quite ready for."
p330
aVAnd that's certainly been my experience with transition.
p331
aVFrom three years ago, it just being an idea,
p332
aVthis has become something that has virally swept around the world.
p333
aVWe're getting a lot of interest from government. Ed Miliband,
p334
aVthe energy minister of this country, was invited to come to our recent conference
p335
aVas a keynote listener.
p336
aVWhich he did \u2014
p337
aV(Laughter)
p338
aV(Applause) \u2014
p339
aVand has since become a great advocate of the whole idea.
p340
aa(lp341
VThere are now two local authorities in this country
p342
aVwho have declared themselves transitional local authorities,
p343
aVLeicestershire and Somerset. And in Stroud,
p344
aVthe transition group there, in effect, wrote the local government's food plan.
p345
aVAnd the head of the council said,
p346
aV"If we didn't have Transition Stroud, we would have to invent
p347
aVall of that community infrastructure for the first time."
p348
aVAs we see the spread of it, we see national hubs emerging.
p349
aa(lp350
VIn Scotland, the Scottish government's climate change fund
p351
aVhas funded Transition Scotland
p352
aVas a national organization supporting the spread of this.
p353
aVAnd we see it all over the place as well now.
p354
aVBut the key to transition is thinking not that we have to change everything now,
p355
aVbut that things are already inevitably changing,
p356
aVand what we need to do is to work creatively with that,
p357
aVbased on asking the right questions.
p358
aa(lp359
VI think I'd like to just return at the end
p360
aVto the idea of stories.
p361
aVBecause I think stories are vital here.
p362
aVAnd actually the stories that we tell ourselves,
p363
aVwe have a huge dearth of stories about how to move forward creatively from here.
p364
aVAnd one of the key things that transition does
p365
aVis to pull those stories out of what people are doing.
p366
aVStories about the community that's produced
p367
aVits own 21 pound note, for example,
p368
aVthe school that's turned its car park into a food garden,
p369
aVthe community that's founded its own energy company.
p370
aVAnd for me, one of the great stories recently
p371
aVwas the Obamas digging up the south lawn of the White House
p372
aVto create a vegetable garden. Because the last time that was done,
p373
aVwhen Eleanor Roosevelt did it,
p374
aVit led to the creation of 20 million vegetable gardens across the United States.
p375
aa(lp376
VSo the question I'd like to leave you with, really,
p377
aVis \u2014 for all aspects of the things that your community needs
p378
aVin order to thrive,
p379
aVhow can it be done in such a way
p380
aVthat drastically reduces its carbon emissions,
p381
aVwhile also building resilience?
p382
aa(lp383
VPersonally, I feel enormously grateful
p384
aVto have lived through the age of cheap oil.
p385
aVI've been astonishingly lucky, we've been astonishingly lucky.
p386
aVBut let us honor what it has bought us,
p387
aVand move forward from this point.
p388
aVBecause if we cling to it, and continue to assume
p389
aVthat it can underpin our choices,
p390
aVthe future that it presents to us is one which is really unmanageable.
p391
aVAnd by loving and leaving all that oil has done for us,
p392
aVand that the Oil Age has done for us,
p393
aVwe are able to then begin the creation
p394
aVof a world which is more resilient,
p395
aVmore nourishing,
p396
aVand in which, we find ourselves fitter, more skilled
p397
aVand more connected to each other.
p398
aVThank you very much.
