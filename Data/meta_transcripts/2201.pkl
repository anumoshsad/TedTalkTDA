VWe humans have always been very concerned about the health of our bodies,
p4
aVbut we haven't always been that good at figuring out what's important.
p5
aVTake the ancient Egyptians, for example:
p6
aVvery concerned about the body parts they thought they'd need in the afterlife,
p7
aVbut they left some parts out.
p8
aVThis part, for example.
p9
aVAlthough they very carefully  preserved the stomach, the lungs,
p10
aVthe liver, and so forth,
p11
aVthey just mushed up the brain, drained it out through the nose,
p12
aVand threw it away,
p13
aVwhich makes sense, really,
p14
aVbecause what does a brain do for us anyway?
p15
aVBut imagine if there were a kind of neglected organ in our bodies
p16
aVthat weighed just as much as the brain
p17
aVand in some ways was just as important to who we are,
p18
aVbut we knew so little about and treated with such disregard.
p19
aVAnd imagine if, through new scientific advances,
p20
aVwe were just beginning to understand
p21
aVits importance to how we think of ourselves.
p22
aVWouldn't you want to know more about it?
p23
aa(lp24
VWell, it turns out that we do have something just like that:
p25
aVour gut,
p26
aVor rather, its microbes.
p27
aVBut it's not just the microbes in our gut that are important.
p28
aVMicrobes all over our body
p29
aVturn out to be really critical to a whole range of differences
p30
aVthat make different people who we are.
p31
aVSo for example, have you ever noticed
p32
aVhow some people get bitten by mosquitos way more often than others?
p33
aa(lp34
VIt turns out that everyone's anecdotal experience out camping is actually true.
p35
aVFor example, I seldom get bitten by mosquitos,
p36
aVbut my partner Amanda attracts them in droves,
p37
aVand the reason why is that we have different microbes on our skin
p38
aVthat produce different chemicals that the mosquitos detect.
p39
aa(lp40
VNow, microbes are also really important in the field of medicine.
p41
aVSo, for example, what microbes you have in your gut
p42
aVdetermine whether particular painkillers are toxic to your liver.
p43
aVThey also determine whether or not other drugs will work for your heart condition.
p44
aVAnd, if you're a fruit fly, at least,
p45
aVyour microbes determine who you want to have sex with.
p46
aVWe haven't demonstrated this in humans yet
p47
aVbut maybe it's just a matter of time before we find out. (Laughter)
p48
aa(lp49
VSo microbes are performing a huge range of functions.
p50
aVThey help us digest our food.
p51
aVThey help educate our immune system.
p52
aVThey help us resist disease,
p53
aVand they may even be affecting our behavior.
p54
aVSo what would a map of all these microbial communities look like?
p55
aVWell, it wouldn't look exactly like this,
p56
aVbut it's a helpful guide for understanding biodiversity.
p57
aVDifferent parts of the world have different landscapes of organisms
p58
aVthat are immediately characteristic of one place or another
p59
aVor another.
p60
aVWith microbiology, it's kind of the same, although I've got to be honest with you:
p61
aVAll the microbes essentially look the same under a microscope.
p62
aVSo instead of trying to identify them visually,
p63
aVwhat we do is we look at their DNA sequences,
p64
aVand in a project called the Human Microbiome Project,
p65
aVNIH funded this $173 million project
p66
aVwhere hundreds  of researchers came together
p67
aVto map out all the A's, T's, G's, and C's,
p68
aVand all of these microbes in the human body.
p69
aVSo when we take them together, they look like this.
p70
aVIt's a bit more difficult to tell who lives where now, isn't it?
p71
aa(lp72
VWhat my lab does is develop computational techniques that allow us
p73
aVto take all these terabytes of sequence data
p74
aVand turn them into something that's a bit more useful as a map,
p75
aVand so when we do that with the human microbiome data
p76
aVfrom 250 healthy volunteers,
p77
aVit looks like this.
p78
aVEach point here represents all the complex microbes
p79
aVin an entire microbial community.
p80
aVSee, I told you they basically all look the same.
p81
aVSo what we're looking at is each point represents one microbial community
p82
aVfrom one body site of one healthy volunteer.
p83
aVAnd so you can see that there's different parts of the map in different colors,
p84
aValmost like separate continents.
p85
aVAnd what it turns out to be
p86
aVis that those, as the different regions of the body,
p87
aVhave very different microbes in them.
p88
aVSo what we have is we have the oral community up there in green.
p89
aVOver on the other side, we have the skin community in blue,
p90
aVthe vaginal community in purple,
p91
aVand then right down at the bottom, we have the fecal community in brown.
p92
aVAnd we've just over the last few years
p93
aVfound out that the microbes in different parts of the body
p94
aVare amazingly different from one another.
p95
aVSo if I look at just one person's microbes
p96
aVin the mouth and in the gut,
p97
aVit turns out that the difference between those two microbial communities
p98
aVis enormous.
p99
aVIt's bigger than the difference between the microbes in this reef
p100
aVand the microbes in this prairie.
p101
aVSo this is incredible when you think about it.
p102
aVWhat it means is that a few feet of difference in the human body
p103
aVmakes more of a difference to your microbial ecology
p104
aVthan hundreds of miles on Earth.
p105
aa(lp106
VAnd this is not to say that two people  look basically the same
p107
aVin the same body habitat, either.
p108
aVSo you probably heard
p109
aVthat we're pretty much all the same in terms of our human DNA.
p110
aVYou're 99.99 percent identical in terms of your human DNA
p111
aVto the person sitting next to you.
p112
aVBut that's not true of your gut microbes:
p113
aVyou might only share 10 percent similarity
p114
aVwith the person sitting next to you in terms of your gut microbes.
p115
aVSo that's as different as the bacteria on this prairie
p116
aVand the bacteria in this forest.
p117
aa(lp118
VSo these different microbes
p119
aVhave all these different kinds  of functions that I told you about,
p120
aVeverything from digesting food
p121
aVto involvement in different kinds of diseases,
p122
aVmetabolizing drugs, and so forth.
p123
aVSo how do they do all this stuff?
p124
aVWell, in part it's because
p125
aValthough there's just three pounds of those microbes in our gut,
p126
aVthey really outnumber us.
p127
aVAnd so how much do they outnumber us?
p128
aVWell, it depends on what you think of as our bodies.
p129
aVIs it our cells?
p130
aVWell, each of us consists of about 10 trillion human cells,
p131
aVbut we harbor as many as 100 trillion microbial cells.
p132
aVSo they outnumber us 10 to one.
p133
aVNow, you might think, well, we're human because of our DNA,
p134
aVbut it turns out that each of us has about 20,000 human genes,
p135
aVdepending on what you count exactly,
p136
aVbut as many as two million to 20 million microbial genes.
p137
aVSo whichever way we look at it, we're vastly outnumbered
p138
aVby our microbial symbionts.
p139
aVAnd it turns out that in addition  to traces of our human DNA,
p140
aVwe also leave traces of our microbial DNA
p141
aVon everything we touch.
p142
aVWe showed in a study a few years ago
p143
aVthat you can actually match the palm of someone's hand up
p144
aVto the computer mouse that they use routinely
p145
aVwith up to 95 percent accuracy.
p146
aVSo this came out in a scientific journal a few years ago,
p147
aVbut more importantly, it was featured on "CSI: Miami,"
p148
aVso you really know it's true.
p149
aV(Laughter)
p150
aa(lp151
VSo where do our microbes come from in the first place?
p152
aVWell if, as I do, you have dogs or kids,
p153
aVyou probably have some dark suspicions about that,
p154
aVall of which are true, by the way.
p155
aVSo just like we can match you to your computer equipment
p156
aVby the microbes you share,
p157
aVwe can also match you up to your dog.
p158
aVBut it turns out that in adults,
p159
aVmicrobial communities are relatively stable,
p160
aVso even if you live together with someone,
p161
aVyou'll maintain your separate microbial identity
p162
aVover a period of weeks, months, even years.
p163
aa(lp164
VIt turns out that our first microbial communities
p165
aVdepend a lot on how we're born.
p166
aVSo babies that come out the regular way,
p167
aVall of their microbes are basically like the vaginal community,
p168
aVwhereas babies that are delivered by C-section,
p169
aVall of their microbes instead look like skin.
p170
aVAnd this might be associated with some of the differences
p171
aVin health associated with Cesarean birth,
p172
aVsuch as more asthma, more allergies, even more obesity,
p173
aVall of which have been linked to microbes now,
p174
aVand when you think about it, until recently, every surviving mammal
p175
aVhad been delivered by the birth canal,
p176
aVand so the lack of those protective microbes
p177
aVthat we've co-evolved with might be really important
p178
aVfor a lot of these different conditions that we now know involve the microbiome.
p179
aa(lp180
VWhen my own daughter was born a couple of years ago
p181
aVby emergency C-section,
p182
aVwe took matters into our own hands
p183
aVand made sure she was coated with those vaginal microbes
p184
aVthat she would have gotten naturally.
p185
aVNow, it's really difficult to tell whether this has had an effect
p186
aVon her health specifically, right?
p187
aVWith a sample size of just one child, no matter how much we love her,
p188
aVyou don't really have enough of a sample size
p189
aVto figure out what happens on average,
p190
aVbut at two years old, she hasn't had an ear infection yet,
p191
aVso we're keeping our fingers crossed on that one.
p192
aVAnd what's more, we're starting to do clinical trials with more children
p193
aVto figure out whether this has a protective effect generally.
p194
aa(lp195
VSo how we're born has a tremendous effect on what microbes we have initially,
p196
aVbut where do we go after that?
p197
aVWhat I'm showing you again here is this map
p198
aVof the Human Microbiome Project Data,
p199
aVso each point represents a sample from one body site
p200
aVfrom one of 250 healthy adults.
p201
aVAnd you've seen children develop physically.
p202
aVYou've seen them develop mentally.
p203
aVNow, for the first time, you're going to see
p204
aVone of my colleague's children develop microbially.
p205
aVSo what we are going to look at
p206
aVis we're going to look  at this one baby's stool,
p207
aVthe fecal community, which represents the gut,
p208
aVsampled every week for almost two and a half years.
p209
aVAnd so we're starting on day one.
p210
aVWhat's going to happen is that the infant is going to start off as this yellow dot,
p211
aVand you can see that he's starting off basically in the vaginal community,
p212
aVas we would expect from his delivery mode.
p213
aVAnd what's going to happen over these two and a half years
p214
aVis that he's going to travel  all the way down
p215
aVto resemble the adult fecal community from healthy volunteers down at the bottom.
p216
aVSo I'm just going to start this going and we'll see how that happens.
p217
aa(lp218
VWhat you can see, and remember each step in this is just one week,
p219
aVwhat you can see is that week to week,
p220
aVthe change in the microbial community of the feces of this one child,
p221
aVthe differences week to week are much greater
p222
aVthan the differences between individual healthy adults
p223
aVin the Human Microbiome Project cohort,
p224
aVwhich are those brown dots down at the bottom.
p225
aVAnd you can see he's starting to approach the adult fecal community.
p226
aVThis is up to about two years.
p227
aVBut something amazing is about to happen here.
p228
aVSo he's getting antibiotics for an ear infection.
p229
aVWhat you can see is this huge change in the community,
p230
aVfollowed by a relatively rapid recovery.
p231
aVI'll just rewind that for you.
p232
aVAnd what we can see is that just over these few weeks,
p233
aVwe have a much more radical change,
p234
aVa setback of many months  of normal development,
p235
aVfollowed by a relatively rapid recovery,
p236
aVand by the time he reaches day 838,
p237
aVwhich is the end of this video,
p238
aVyou can see that he has essentially reached the healthy adult stool community,
p239
aVdespite that antibiotic intervention.
p240
aa(lp241
VSo this is really interesting because it raises fundamental questions
p242
aVabout what happens when we intervene at different ages in a child's life.
p243
aVSo does what we do early on, where the microbiome is changing so rapidly,
p244
aVactually matter,
p245
aVor is it like throwing a stone into a stormy sea,
p246
aVwhere the ripples will just be lost?
p247
aVWell, fascinatingly, it turns out that if you give children antibiotics
p248
aVin the first six months of life,
p249
aVthey're more likely to become obese later on
p250
aVthan if they don't get antibiotics then or only get them later,
p251
aVand so what we do early on may have profound impacts
p252
aVon the gut microbial community and on later health
p253
aVthat we're only beginning to understand.
p254
aVSo this is fascinating, because one day, in addition to the effects
p255
aVthat antibiotics have on antibiotic-resistant bacteria,
p256
aVwhich are very important,
p257
aVthey may also be degrading our gut microbial ecosystems,
p258
aVand so one day we may come to regard antibiotics with the same horror
p259
aVthat we currently reserve for those metal tools
p260
aVthat the Egyptians used to use to mush up the brains
p261
aVbefore they drained them out for embalming.
p262
aa(lp263
VSo I mentioned that microbes have all these important functions,
p264
aVand they've also now, just over the past few years,
p265
aVbeen connected to a whole range of different diseases,
p266
aVincluding inflammatory bowel disease,
p267
aVheart disease, colon cancer,
p268
aVand even obesity.
p269
aVObesity has a really  large effect, as it turns out,
p270
aVand today, we can tell whether you're lean or obese
p271
aVwith 90 percent accuracy
p272
aVby looking at the microbes in your gut.
p273
aVNow, although that might sound impressive,
p274
aVin some ways it's a little bit problematic as a medical test,
p275
aVbecause you can probably tell which of these people is obese
p276
aVwithout knowing anything about their gut microbes,
p277
aVbut it turns out that even if we sequence their complete genomes
p278
aVand had all their human DNA,
p279
aVwe could only predict which one was obese with about 60 percent accuracy.
p280
aVSo that's amazing, right?
p281
aVWhat it means that the three pounds of microbes that you carry around with you
p282
aVmay be more important for some health conditions
p283
aVthan every single gene in your genome.
p284
aa(lp285
VAnd then in mice, we can do a lot more.
p286
aVSo in mice, microbes have been linked to all kinds of additional conditions,
p287
aVincluding things like multiple sclerosis,
p288
aVdepression, autism, and again, obesity.
p289
aVBut how can we tell whether these microbial differences
p290
aVthat correlate with disease are cause or effect?
p291
aVWell, one thing we can do is we can raise some mice
p292
aVwithout any microbes of their own in a germ-free bubble.
p293
aVThen we can add in some microbes that we think are important,
p294
aVand see what happens.
p295
aVWhen we take the microbes from an obese mouse
p296
aVand transplant them into a genetically normal mouse
p297
aVthat's been raised in a bubble with no microbes of its own,
p298
aVit becomes fatter than if it got them  from a regular mouse.
p299
aVWhy this happens is absolutely amazing, though.
p300
aVSometimes what's going on is that the microbes
p301
aVare helping them digest food more efficiently from the same diet,
p302
aVso they're taking more energy from their food,
p303
aVbut other times, the microbes are actually affecting their behavior.
p304
aVWhat they're doing is they're eating more than the normal mouse,
p305
aVso they only get fat if we let them  eat as much as they want.
p306
aa(lp307
VSo this is really remarkable, right?
p308
aVThe implication is that microbes can affect mammalian behavior.
p309
aVSo you might be wondering whether we can  also do this sort of thing across species,
p310
aVand it turns out that if you take microbes from an obese person
p311
aVand transplant them into mice you've raised germ-free,
p312
aVthose mice will also become fatter
p313
aVthan if they received the microbes from a lean person,
p314
aVbut we can design a microbial community that we inoculate them with
p315
aVthat prevents them from gaining this weight.
p316
aa(lp317
VWe can also do this for malnutrition.
p318
aVSo in a project funded by the Gates Foundation,
p319
aVwhat we're looking at is children in Malawi
p320
aVwho have kwashiorkor, a profound form of malnutrition,
p321
aVand mice that get the kwashiorkor community transplanted into them
p322
aVlose 30 percent of their body mass
p323
aVin just three weeks,
p324
aVbut we can restore their health by using  the same peanut butter-based supplement
p325
aVthat is used for  the children in the clinic,
p326
aVand the mice that receive the community
p327
aVfrom the healthy identical twins of the kwashiorkor children do fine.
p328
aVThis is truly amazing because it suggests that we can pilot therapies
p329
aVby trying them out in a whole bunch of different mice
p330
aVwith individual people's gut communities
p331
aVand perhaps tailor those therapies all the way down to the individual level.
p332
aa(lp333
VSo I think it's really important that everyone has a chance
p334
aVto participate in this discovery.
p335
aVSo, a couple of years ago,
p336
aVwe started this project called American Gut,
p337
aVwhich allows you to claim a place  for yourself on this microbial map.
p338
aVThis is now the largest crowd-funded science project that we know of \u2014
p339
aVover 8,000 people have signed up at this point.
p340
aVWhat happens is, they send in their samples,
p341
aVwe sequence the DNA of their microbes and then release the results back to them.
p342
aVWe also release them, de-identified, to scientists, to educators,
p343
aVto interested members of the general public, and so forth,
p344
aVso anyone can have access to the data.
p345
aVOn the other hand,
p346
aVwhen we do tours of our lab at the BioFrontiers Institute,
p347
aVand we explain that we use robots and lasers to look at poop,
p348
aVit turns out that not everyone wants to know.
p349
aV(Laughter)
p350
aVBut I'm guessing that many of you do,
p351
aVand so I brought some kits here if you're interested
p352
aVin trying this out for yourself.
p353
aa(lp354
VSo why might we want to do this?
p355
aVWell, it turns out that microbes are not just important
p356
aVfor finding out where we are in terms of our health,
p357
aVbut they can actually cure disease.
p358
aVThis is one of the newest things we've been able to visualize
p359
aVwith colleagues  at the University of Minnesota.
p360
aVSo here's that map of the human microbiome again.
p361
aVWhat we're looking at now \u2014
p362
aVI'm going to add in the community of some people with C. diff.
p363
aVSo, this is a terrible form of diarrhea
p364
aVwhere you have to go up to 20 times a day,
p365
aVand these people have failed antibiotic therapy for two years
p366
aVbefore they're eligible for this trial.
p367
aVSo what would happen if we transplanted some of the stool from a healthy donor,
p368
aVthat star down at the bottom,
p369
aVinto these patients.
p370
aVWould the good microbes do battle with the bad microbes
p371
aVand help to restore their health?
p372
aVSo let's watch exactly what happens there.
p373
aVFour of those patients are about to get a transplant
p374
aVfrom that healthy donor at the bottom,
p375
aVand what you can see is that immediately,
p376
aVyou have this radical change in the gut community.
p377
aVSo one day after you do that transplant,
p378
aVall those symptoms clear up,
p379
aVthe diarrhea vanishes,
p380
aVand they're essentially healthy again, coming to resemble the donor's community,
p381
aVand they stay there.
p382
aV(Applause)
p383
aa(lp384
VSo we're just at the beginning of this discovery.
p385
aVWe're just finding out that microbes have implications
p386
aVfor all these different kinds of diseases,
p387
aVranging from inflammatory  bowel disease to obesity,
p388
aVand perhaps even autism and depression.
p389
aVWhat we need to do, though,
p390
aVis we need to develop a kind of microbial GPS,
p391
aVwhere we don't just know where we are currently
p392
aVbut also where we want to go and what we need to do
p393
aVin order to get there,
p394
aVand we need to be able to make this simple enough
p395
aVthat even a child can use it. (Laughter)
