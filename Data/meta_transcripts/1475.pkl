(lp3
VSo my freshman year of college
p4
aVI signed up for an internship in the housing unit
p5
aVat Greater Boston Legal Services.
p6
aVShowed up the first day
p7
aVready to make coffee and photocopies,
p8
aVbut was paired with this righteous, deeply inspired attorney
p9
aVnamed Jeff Purcell,
p10
aVwho thrust me onto the front lines
p11
aVfrom the very first day.
p12
aa(lp13
VAnd over the course of nine months
p14
aVI had the chance
p15
aVto have dozens of conversations
p16
aVwith low-income families in Boston
p17
aVwho would come in presenting with housing issues,
p18
aVbut always had an underlying health issue.
p19
aVSo I had a client who came in,
p20
aVabout to be evicted because he hasn't paid his rent.
p21
aVBut he hasn't paid his rent, of course,
p22
aVbecause he's paying for his HIV medication
p23
aVand just can't afford both.
p24
aVWe had moms who would come in,
p25
aVdaughter has asthma,
p26
aVwakes up covered in cockroaches every morning.
p27
aVAnd one of our litigation strategies
p28
aVwas actually to send me into the home of these clients
p29
aVwith these large glass bottles.
p30
aVAnd I would collect the cockroaches,
p31
aVhot glue-gun them to this poster board
p32
aVthat we'd bring to court for our cases.
p33
aVAnd we always won
p34
aVbecause the judges were just so grossed out.
p35
aVFar more effective, I have to say,
p36
aVthan anything I later learned in law school.
p37
aa(lp38
VBut over the course of these nine months,
p39
aVI grew frustrated with feeling
p40
aVlike we were intervening too far downstream
p41
aVin the lives of our clients \u2014
p42
aVthat by the time they came to us,
p43
aVthey were already in crisis.
p44
aVAnd at the end of my freshman year of college,
p45
aVI read an article about the work
p46
aVthat Dr. Barry Zuckerman was doing
p47
aVas Chair of Pediatrics
p48
aVat Boston Medical Center.
p49
aVAnd his first hire was a legal services attorney
p50
aVto represent the patients.
p51
aa(lp52
VSo I called Barry,
p53
aVand with his blessing, in October 1995
p54
aVwalked into the waiting room
p55
aVof the pediatrics clinic at Boston Medical Center.
p56
aVI'll never forget,
p57
aVthe TVs played this endless reel of cartoons.
p58
aVAnd the exhaustion of mothers
p59
aVwho had taken two, three, sometimes four buses
p60
aVto bring their child to the doctor
p61
aVwas just palpable.
p62
aa(lp63
VThe doctors, it seemed,
p64
aVnever really had enough time for all the patients,
p65
aVtry as they might.
p66
aVAnd over the course of six months,
p67
aVI would corner them in the hallway
p68
aVand ask them a sort of naive but fundamental question:
p69
aV"If you had unlimited resources,
p70
aVwhat's the one thing you would give your patients?"
p71
aa(lp72
VAnd I heard the same story again and again,
p73
aVa story we've heard hundreds of times since then.
p74
aVThey said, "Every day we have patients that come into the clinic \u2014
p75
aVchild has an ear infection,
p76
aVI prescribe antibiotics.
p77
aVBut the real issue is there's no food at home.
p78
aVThe real issue
p79
aVis that child is living with 12 other people
p80
aVin a two-bedroom apartment.
p81
aVAnd I don't even ask about those issues
p82
aVbecause there's nothing I can do.
p83
aVI have 13 minutes with each patient.
p84
aVPatients are piling up in the clinic waiting room.
p85
aVI have no idea where the nearest food pantry is.
p86
aVAnd I don't even have any help."
p87
aVIn that clinic, even today,
p88
aVthere are two social workers
p89
aVfor 24,000 pediatric patients,
p90
aVwhich is better than a lot of the clinics out there.
p91
aa(lp92
VSo Health Leads was born of these conversations \u2014
p93
aVa simple model
p94
aVwhere doctors and nurses
p95
aVcan prescribe nutritious food,
p96
aVheat in the winter
p97
aVand other basic resources for their patients
p98
aVthe same way they prescribe medication.
p99
aVPatients then take their prescriptions
p100
aVto our desk in the clinic waiting room
p101
aVwhere we have a core of well-trained college student advocates
p102
aVwho work side by side with these families
p103
aVto connect them out
p104
aVto the existing landscape of community resources.
p105
aa(lp106
VSo we began with a card table in the clinic waiting room \u2014
p107
aVtotally lemonade stand style.
p108
aVBut today we have a thousand college student advocates
p109
aVwho are working to connect nearly 9,000 patients and their families
p110
aVwith the resources that they need to be healthy.
p111
aa(lp112
VSo 18 months ago
p113
aVI got this email that changed my life.
p114
aVAnd the email was from Dr. Jack Geiger,
p115
aVwho had written to congratulate me on Health Leads
p116
aVand to share, as he said,
p117
aVa bit of historical context.
p118
aVIn 1965 Dr. Geiger founded
p119
aVone of the first two community health centers in this country,
p120
aVin a brutally poor area in the Mississippi Delta.
p121
aVAnd so many of his patients came in
p122
aVpresenting with malnutrition
p123
aVthat be began prescribing food for them.
p124
aVAnd they would take these prescriptions to the local supermarket,
p125
aVwhich would fill them
p126
aVand then charge the pharmacy budget of the clinic.
p127
aVAnd when the Office of Economic Opportunity in Washington, D.C. \u2014
p128
aVwhich was funding Geiger's clinic \u2014
p129
aVfound out about this,
p130
aVthey were furious.
p131
aVAnd they sent this bureaucrat down
p132
aVto tell Geiger that he was expected to use their dollars
p133
aVfor medical care \u2014
p134
aVto which Geiger famously and logically responded,
p135
aV"The last time I checked my textbooks,
p136
aVthe specific therapy for malnutrition was food."
p137
aa(lp138
V(Laughter)
p139
aa(lp140
VSo when I got this email from Dr. Geiger,
p141
aVI knew I was supposed to be proud
p142
aVto be part of this history.
p143
aVBut the truth is
p144
aVI was devastated.
p145
aVHere we are,
p146
aV45 years after Geiger has prescribed food for his patients,
p147
aVand I have doctors telling me,
p148
aV"On those issues, we practice a 'don't ask, don't tell' policy."
p149
aVForty-five years after Geiger,
p150
aVHealth Leads has to reinvent
p151
aVthe prescription for basic resources.
p152
aVSo I have spent hours upon hours
p153
aVtrying to make sense of this weird Groundhog Day.
p154
aVHow is it that if for decades
p155
aVwe had a pretty straightforward tool for keeping patients,
p156
aVand especially low-income patients, healthy,
p157
aVthat we didn't use it?
p158
aVIf we know what it takes to have a healthcare system
p159
aVrather than a sick-care system,
p160
aVwhy don't we just do it?
p161
aa(lp162
VThese questions, in my mind,
p163
aVare not hard because the answers are complicated,
p164
aVthey are hard because they require that we be honest with ourselves.
p165
aVMy belief is that it's almost too painful
p166
aVto articulate our aspirations for our healthcare system,
p167
aVor even admit that we have any at all.
p168
aVBecause if we did,
p169
aVthey would be so removed
p170
aVfrom our current reality.
p171
aVBut that doesn't change my belief
p172
aVthat all of us, deep inside,
p173
aVhere in this room and across this country,
p174
aVshare a similar set of desires.
p175
aVThat if we are honest with ourselves
p176
aVand listen quietly,
p177
aVthat we all harbor
p178
aVone fiercely held aspiration for our healthcare:
p179
aVthat it keep us healthy.
p180
aa(lp181
VThis aspiration that our healthcare keep us healthy
p182
aVis an enormously powerful one.
p183
aVAnd the way I think about this
p184
aVis that healthcare is like any other system.
p185
aVIt's just a set of choices that people make.
p186
aVWhat if we decided
p187
aVto make a different set of choices?
p188
aVWhat if we decided to take all the parts of healthcare
p189
aVthat have drifted away from us
p190
aVand stand firm and say, "No.
p191
aVThese things are ours.
p192
aVThey will be used for our purposes.
p193
aVThey will be used to realize
p194
aVour aspiration"?
p195
aVWhat if everything we needed
p196
aVto realize our aspiration for healthcare
p197
aVwas right there in front of us
p198
aVjust waiting to be claimed?
p199
aa(lp200
VSo that's where Health Leads began.
p201
aVWe started with the prescription pad \u2014
p202
aVa very ordinary piece of paper \u2014
p203
aVand we asked, not what do patients need to get healthy \u2014
p204
aVantibiotics, an inhaler, medication \u2014
p205
aVbut what do patients need to be healthy,
p206
aVto not get sick in the first place?
p207
aVAnd we chose to use the prescription
p208
aVfor that purpose.
p209
aVSo just a few miles from here
p210
aVat Children's National Medical Center,
p211
aVwhen patients come into the doctor's office,
p212
aVthey're asked a few questions.
p213
aVThey're asked, "Are you running out of food at the end of the month?
p214
aVDo you have safe housing?"
p215
aVAnd when the doctor begins the visit,
p216
aVshe knows height, weight, is there food at home,
p217
aVis the family living in a shelter.
p218
aVAnd that not only leads to a better set of clinical choices,
p219
aVbut the doctor can also prescribe those resources for the patient,
p220
aVusing Health Leads like any other sub-specialty referral.
p221
aa(lp222
VThe problem is,
p223
aVonce you get a taste of what it's like
p224
aVto realize your aspiration for healthcare,
p225
aVyou want more.
p226
aVSo we thought,
p227
aVif we can get individual doctors
p228
aVto prescribe these basic resources for their patients,
p229
aVcould we get an entire healthcare system
p230
aVto shift its presumption?
p231
aVAnd we gave it a shot.
p232
aa(lp233
VSo now at Harlem Hospital Center
p234
aVwhen patients come in with an elevated body mass index,
p235
aVthe electronic medical record
p236
aVautomatically generates a prescription for Health Leads.
p237
aVAnd our volunteers can then work with them
p238
aVto connect patients to healthy food and excercise programs
p239
aVin their communities.
p240
aVWe've created a presumption
p241
aVthat if you're a patient at that hospital
p242
aVwith an elevated BMI,
p243
aVthe four walls of the doctor's office
p244
aVprobably aren't going to give you everything
p245
aVyou need to be healthy.
p246
aVYou need more.
p247
aa(lp248
VSo on the one hand,
p249
aVthis is just a basic recoding
p250
aVof the electronic medical record.
p251
aVAnd on the other hand,
p252
aVit's a radical transformation
p253
aVof the electronic medical record
p254
aVfrom a static repository of diagnostic information
p255
aVto a health promotion tool.
p256
aVIn the private sector,
p257
aVwhen you squeeze that kind of additional value
p258
aVout of a fixed-cost investment,
p259
aVit's called a billion-dollar company.
p260
aVBut in my world,
p261
aVit's called reduced obesity and diabetes.
p262
aVIt's called healthcare \u2014
p263
aVa system where doctors can prescribe solutions
p264
aVto improve health,
p265
aVnot just manage disease.
p266
aa(lp267
VSame thing in the clinic waiting room.
p268
aVSo every day in this country
p269
aVthree million patients
p270
aVpass through about 150,000 clinic waiting rooms in this country.
p271
aVAnd what do they do when they're there?
p272
aVThey sit, they watch the goldfish in the fish tank,
p273
aVthey read extremely old copies
p274
aVof Good Housekeeping magazine.
p275
aVBut mostly we all just sit there forever, waiting.
p276
aVHow did we get here
p277
aVwhere we devote hundreds of acres and thousands of hours
p278
aVto waiting?
p279
aVWhat if we had a waiting room
p280
aVwhere you don't just sit when you're sick,
p281
aVbut where you go to get healthy.
p282
aVIf airports can become shopping malls
p283
aVand McDonald's can become playgrounds,
p284
aVsurely we can reinvent the clinic waiting room.
p285
aa(lp286
VAnd that's what Health Leads has tried to do,
p287
aVto reclaim that real estate and that time
p288
aVand to use it as a gateway
p289
aVto connect patients
p290
aVto the resources they need to be healthy.
p291
aVSo it's a brutal winter in the Northeast,
p292
aVyour kid has asthma, your heat just got turned off,
p293
aVand of course you're in the waiting room of the ER,
p294
aVbecause the cold air triggered your child's asthma.
p295
aVBut what if instead of waiting for hours anxiously,
p296
aVthe waiting room became the place
p297
aVwhere Health Leads turned your heat back on?
p298
aa(lp299
VAnd of course all of this requires
p300
aVa broader workforce.
p301
aVBut if we're creative, we already have that too.
p302
aVWe know that our doctors and nurses
p303
aVand even social workers
p304
aVaren't enough,
p305
aVthat the ticking minutes of health care
p306
aVare too constraining.
p307
aVHealth just takes more time.
p308
aVIt requires a non-clinical army
p309
aVof community health workers and case managers
p310
aVand many others.
p311
aa(lp312
VWhat if a small part of that next healthcare workforce
p313
aVwere the 11 million college students in this country?
p314
aVUnencumbered by clinical responsibilities,
p315
aVunwilling to take no for an answer
p316
aVfrom those bureaucracies
p317
aVthat tend to crush patients,
p318
aVand with an unparalleled ability
p319
aVfor information retrieval
p320
aVhoned through years of using Google.
p321
aa(lp322
VNow lest you think it improbable
p323
aVthat a college volunteer
p324
aVcan make this kind of commitment,
p325
aVI have two words for you:
p326
aVMarch Madness.
p327
aVThe average NCAA Division I men's basketball player
p328
aVdedicates 39 hours a week to his sport.
p329
aVNow we may think that's good or bad,
p330
aVbut in either case it's real.
p331
aVAnd Health Leads is based on the presumption
p332
aVthat for too long
p333
aVwe have asked too little of our college students
p334
aVwhen it comes to real impact in vulnerable communities.
p335
aVCollege sports teams say,
p336
aV"We're going to take dozens of hours
p337
aVat some field across campus at some ungodly hour of the morning
p338
aVand we're going to measure your performance, and your team's performance,
p339
aVand if you don't measure up or you don't show up,
p340
aVwe're going to cut you off the team.
p341
aVBut we'll make huge investments
p342
aVin your training and development,
p343
aVand we'll give you an extraordinary community of peers."
p344
aVAnd people line up out the door
p345
aVjust for the chance to be part of it.
p346
aa(lp347
VSo our feeling is,
p348
aVif it's good enough for the rugby team,
p349
aVit's good enough for health and poverty.
p350
aVHealth Leads too recruits competitively,
p351
aVtrains intensively,
p352
aVcoaches professionally,
p353
aVdemands significant time,
p354
aVbuilds a cohesive team
p355
aVand measures results \u2014
p356
aVa kind of Teach for America for healthcare.
p357
aa(lp358
VNow in the top 10 cities in the U.S.
p359
aVwith the largest number of Medicaid patients,
p360
aVeach of those has at least 20,000 college students.
p361
aVNew York alone has half a million college students.
p362
aVAnd this isn't just a sort of short-term workforce
p363
aVto connect patients to basic resources,
p364
aVit's a next generation healthcare leadership pipeline
p365
aVwho've spent two, three, four years
p366
aVin the clinic waiting room
p367
aVtalking to patients about their most basic health needs.
p368
aVAnd they leave with the conviction,
p369
aVthe ability and the efficacy
p370
aVto realize our most basic aspirations for health care.
p371
aVAnd the thing is, there's thousands of these folks already out there.
p372
aa(lp373
VSo Mia Lozada is Chief Resident of Internal Medicine
p374
aVat UCSF Medical Center,
p375
aVbut for three years as an undergraduate
p376
aVshe was a Health Leads volunteer
p377
aVin the clinic waiting room at Boston Medical Center.
p378
aVMia says, "When my classmates write a prescription,
p379
aVthey think their work is done.
p380
aVWhen I write a prescription,
p381
aVI think, can the family read the prescription?
p382
aVDo they have transportation to the pharmacy?
p383
aVDo they have food to take with the prescription?
p384
aVDo they have insurance to fill the prescription?
p385
aVThose are the questions I learned at Health Leads,
p386
aVnot in medical school."
p387
aa(lp388
VNow none of these solutions \u2014
p389
aVthe prescription pad, the electronic medical record,
p390
aVthe waiting room,
p391
aVthe army of college students \u2014
p392
aVare perfect.
p393
aVBut they are ours for the taking \u2014
p394
aVsimple examples
p395
aVof the vast under-utilized healthcare resources
p396
aVthat, if we reclaimed and redeployed,
p397
aVcould realize our most basic aspiration
p398
aVof healthcare.
p399
aa(lp400
VSo I had been at Legal Services for about nine months
p401
aVwhen this idea of Health Leads started percolating in my mind.
p402
aVAnd I knew I had to tell Jeff Purcell, my attorney,
p403
aVthat I needed to leave.
p404
aVAnd I was so nervous,
p405
aVbecause I thought he was going to be disappointed in me
p406
aVfor abandoning our clients for some crazy idea.
p407
aVAnd I sat down with him and I said,
p408
aV"Jeff, I have this idea
p409
aVthat we could mobilize college students
p410
aVto address patients' most basic health needs."
p411
aVAnd I'll be honest,
p412
aVall I wanted was for him to not be angry at me.
p413
aVBut he said this,
p414
aV"Rebecca, when you have a vision,
p415
aVyou have an obligation to realize that vision.
p416
aVYou must pursue that vision."
p417
aVAnd I have to say, I was like "Whoa.
p418
aVThat's a lot of pressure."
p419
aVI just wanted a blessing,
p420
aVI didn't want some kind of mandate.
p421
aVBut the truth is
p422
aVI've spent every waking minute nearly since then
p423
aVchasing that vision.
p424
aa(lp425
VI believe that we all have a vision
p426
aVfor healthcare in this country.
p427
aVI believe that at the end of the day
p428
aVwhen we measure our healthcare,
p429
aVit will not be by the diseases cured,
p430
aVbut by the diseases prevented.
p431
aVIt will not be by the excellence of our technologies
p432
aVor the sophistication of our specialists,
p433
aVbut by how rarely we needed them.
p434
aVAnd most of all,
p435
aVI believe that when we measure healthcare,
p436
aVit will be, not by what the system was,
p437
aVbut by what we chose it to be.
p438
