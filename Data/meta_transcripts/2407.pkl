VWelcome to Bayeku,
p4
aVa riverine community in Ikorodu, Lagos \u2014
p5
aVa vivid representation of several riverine communities across Nigeria,
p6
aVcommunities whose waterways have been infested
p7
aVby an invasive aquatic weed;
p8
aVcommunities where economic livelihoods have been hampered:
p9
aVfishing, marine transportation
p10
aVand trading;
p11
aVcommunities where fish yields have diminished;
p12
aVcommunities where schoolchildren are unable to go to school
p13
aVfor days, sometimes weeks, on end.
p14
aVWho would have thought that this plant
p15
aVwith round leaves, inflated stems, and showy, lavender flowers
p16
aVwould cause such havoc in these communities.
p17
aa(lp18
VThe plant is known as water hyacinth
p19
aVand its botanical name, Eichhornia crassipes.
p20
aVInterestingly, in Nigeria, the plant is also known by other names,
p21
aVnames associated with historical events,
p22
aVas well as myths.
p23
aVIn some places, the plant is called Babangida.
p24
aVWhen you hear Babangida, you remember the military and military coups.
p25
aVAnd you think: fear, restraint.
p26
aVIn parts of Nigeria in the Niger Delta, the plant is also known as Abiola.
p27
aVWhen you hear Abiola, you remember annulled elections
p28
aVand you think: dashed hopes.
p29
aVIn the southwestern part of Nigeria,
p30
aVthe plant is known as Gbe'borun.
p31
aVGbe'borun is a Yoruba phrase
p32
aVwhich translates to "gossip," or "talebearer."
p33
aVWhen you think of gossip, you think: rapid reproduction, destruction.
p34
aVAnd in the Igala-speaking part of Nigeria,
p35
aVthe plant is known as A Kp'iye Kp'oma,
p36
aVAnd when you hear that, you think of death.
p37
aVIt literally translates to "death to mother and child."
p38
aa(lp39
VI personally had my encounter with this plant in the year 2009.
p40
aVIt was shortly after I had relocated from the US to Nigeria.
p41
aVI'd quit my job in corporate America
p42
aVand decided to take this big leap of faith,
p43
aVa leap of faith that came out of a deep sense of conviction
p44
aVthat there was a lot of work to do in Nigeria
p45
aVin the area of sustainable development.
p46
aVAnd so here I was in the year 2009,
p47
aVactually, at the end of 2009,
p48
aVin Lagos on the Third Mainland Bridge.
p49
aa(lp50
VAnd I looked to my left and saw this very arresting image.
p51
aVIt was an image of fishing boats
p52
aVthat had been hemmed in by dense mats of water hyacinth.
p53
aVAnd I was really pained by what I saw
p54
aVbecause I thought to myself,
p55
aV"These poor fisherfolk,
p56
aVhow are they going to go about their daily activities
p57
aVwith these restrictions."
p58
aVAnd then I thought, "There's got to be a better way."
p59
aVA win-win solution whereby the environment is taken care of
p60
aVby the weeds being cleared out of the way
p61
aVand then this being turned into an economic benefit
p62
aVfor the communities whose lives are impacted the most
p63
aVby the infestation of the weed.
p64
aVThat, I would say, was my spark moment.
p65
aa(lp66
VAnd so I did further research to find out more
p67
aVabout the beneficial uses of this weed.
p68
aVOut of the several, one struck me the most.
p69
aVIt was the use of the plant for handicrafts.
p70
aVAnd I thought, "What a great idea."
p71
aVPersonally, I love handicrafts,
p72
aVespecially handicrafts that are woven around a story.
p73
aVAnd so I thought, "This could be easily deployed within the communities
p74
aVwithout the requirement of technical skills."
p75
aVAnd I thought to myself, "Three simple steps to a mega solution."
p76
aa(lp77
VFirst step: Get out into the waterways and harvest the water hyacinth.
p78
aVThat way, you create access.
p79
aa(lp80
VSecondly, you dry the water hyacinth stems.
p81
aa(lp82
VAnd thirdly, you weave the water hyacinth into products.
p83
aa(lp84
VThe third step was a challenge.
p85
aVSee, I'm a computer scientist by background
p86
aVand not someone in the creative arts.
p87
aVAnd so I began my quest
p88
aVto find out how I can learn how to weave.
p89
aa(lp90
VAnd this quest took me to a community in Ibadan, where I lived,
p91
aVcalled Sabo.
p92
aVSabo translates to "strangers' quarters."
p93
aVAnd the community is predominantly made up of people
p94
aVfrom the northern part of the country.
p95
aVSo I literally took my dried weeds in hand,
p96
aVthere were several more of them,
p97
aVand went knocking from door to door to find out who could teach me
p98
aVhow to weave these water hyacinth stems into ropes.
p99
aVAnd I was directed to the shed of Malam Yahaya.
p100
aVThe problem, though, is that Malam Yahaya doesn't speak English
p101
aVand neither did I speak Hausa.
p102
aVBut some little kids came to the rescue
p103
aVand helped translate.
p104
aVAnd that began my journey of learning how to weave
p105
aVand transform these dried water hyacinth stems
p106
aVinto long ropes.
p107
aa(lp108
VWith my long ropes in hand,
p109
aVI was now equipped to make products.
p110
aVAnd that was the beginning of partnerships.
p111
aVWorking with rattan basket makers to come up with products.
p112
aVSo with this in hand, I felt confident
p113
aVthat I would be able to take this knowledge
p114
aVback into the riverine communities
p115
aVand help them to transform their adversity into prosperity.
p116
aVSo taking these weeds and actually weaving them
p117
aVinto products that can be sold.
p118
aVSo we have pens, we have tableware,
p119
aVwe have purses, we have tissue boxes.
p120
aVThereby, helping the communities
p121
aVto see water hyacinth in a different light.
p122
aVSeeing water hyacinth as being valuable,
p123
aVbeing aesthetic, being durable, tough, resilient.
p124
aVChanging names, changing livelihoods.
p125
aa(lp126
VFrom Gbe'borun, gossip,
p127
aVto Olusotan, storyteller.
p128
aVAnd from A Kp'iye Kp'oma, which is "killer of mother and child,"
p129
aVto Ya du j'ewn w'Iye kp'Oma,
p130
aV"provider of food for mother and child."
p131
aa(lp132
VAnd I'd like to end with a quote by Michael Margolis.
p133
aVHe said, "If you want to learn about a culture, listen to the stories.
p134
aVAnd if you want to change a culture, change the stories."
p135
aa(lp136
VAnd so, from Makoko community, to Abobiri, to Ewoi,
p137
aVto Kolo, to Owahwa, Esaba,
p138
aVwe have changed the story.
p139
aa(lp140
VThank you for listening.
