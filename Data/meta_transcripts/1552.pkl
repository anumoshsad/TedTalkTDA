VSydney. I had been waiting my whole life to get to Sydney.
p4
aVI got to the airport, to the hotel, checked in,
p5
aVand, sitting there in the lobby, was a brochure
p6
aVfor the Sydney Festival. I thumbed through it,
p7
aVand I came across a show called "Minto: Live."
p8
aVThe description read: "The suburban streets of Minto
p9
aVbecome the stage for performances
p10
aVcreated by international artists
p11
aVin collaboration with the people of Minto."
p12
aa(lp13
VWhat was this place called Minto?
p14
aVSydney, as I would learn, is a city of suburbs,
p15
aVand Minto lies southwest, about an hour away.
p16
aVI have to say, it wasn't exactly what I had in mind
p17
aVfor my first day down under.
p18
aVI mean, I'd thought about the Harbour Bridge or Bondi Beach,
p19
aVbut Minto? But still, I'm a producer,
p20
aVand the lure of a site-specific theater project
p21
aVwas more than I could resist. (Laughter)
p22
aa(lp23
VSo, off I went into Friday afternoon traffic,
p24
aVand I'll never forget what I saw when I got there.
p25
aVFor the performance, the audience walked
p26
aVaround the neighborhood from house to house,
p27
aVand the residents, who were the performers,
p28
aVthey came out of their houses, and they performed
p29
aVthese autobiographical dances on their lawns,
p30
aVon their driveways. (Laughter)
p31
aVThe show is a collaboration with a U.K.-based
p32
aVperformance company called Lone Twin.
p33
aVLone Twin had come to Minto and worked
p34
aVwith the residents, and they had created these dances.
p35
aa(lp36
VThis Australian-Indian girl, she came out and started
p37
aVto dance on her front lawn,
p38
aVand her father peered out the window to see
p39
aVwhat all the noise and commotion was about,
p40
aVand he soon joined her.
p41
aVAnd he was followed by her little sister.
p42
aVAnd soon they were all dancing this joyous,
p43
aVexuberant dance right there on their lawn. (Laughter)
p44
aa(lp45
VAnd as I walked through the neighborhood,
p46
aVI was amazed and I was moved by the incredible
p47
aVsense of ownership this community clearly felt
p48
aVabout this event.
p49
aV"Minto: Live" brought Sydneysiders into dialogue
p50
aVwith international artists, and really celebrated
p51
aVthe diversity of Sydney on its own terms.
p52
aa(lp53
VThe Sydney Festival which produced "Minto: Live" I think
p54
aVrepresents a new kind of 21st-century arts festival.
p55
aVThese festivals are radically open.
p56
aVThey can transform cities and communities.
p57
aa(lp58
VTo understand this, I think it kind of makes sense
p59
aVto look where we've come from.
p60
aVModern arts festivals were born
p61
aVin the rubble of World War II.
p62
aVCivic leaders created these annual events
p63
aVto celebrate culture as the highest
p64
aVexpression of the human spirit.
p65
aVIn 1947, the Edinburgh Festival was born
p66
aVand Avignon was born and hundreds of others
p67
aVwould follow in their wake.
p68
aVThe work they did was very, very high art,
p69
aVand stars came along like Laurie Anderson
p70
aVand Merce Cunningham and Robert Lepage
p71
aVwho made work for this circuit,
p72
aVand you had these seminal shows like "The Mahabharata"
p73
aVand the monumental "Einstein on the Beach."
p74
aa(lp75
VBut as the decades passed,
p76
aVthese festivals, they really became the establishment,
p77
aVand as the culture and capital accelerated,
p78
aVthe Internet brought us all together,
p79
aVhigh and low kind of disappeared,
p80
aVa new kind of festival emerged.
p81
aa(lp82
VThe old festivals, they continued to thrive, but
p83
aVfrom Brighton to Rio to Perth, something new was emerging,
p84
aVand these festivals were really different.
p85
aVThey're open, these festivals, because, like in Minto,
p86
aVthey understand that the dialogue
p87
aVbetween the local and the global is essential.
p88
aVThey're open because they ask the audience to be a player,
p89
aVa protagonist, a partner, rather than a passive spectator,
p90
aVand they're open because they know that imagination
p91
aVcannot be contained in buildings,
p92
aVand so much of the work they do
p93
aVis site-specific or outdoor work.
p94
aa(lp95
VSo, the new festival, it asks the audience to play
p96
aVan essential role in shaping the performance.
p97
aVCompanies like De La Guarda, which I produce, and Punchdrunk
p98
aVcreate these completely immersive experiences
p99
aVthat put the audience at the center of the action,
p100
aVbut the German performance company Rimini Protokoll
p101
aVtakes this all to a whole new level.
p102
aVIn a series of shows that includes "100 Percent Vancouver,"
p103
aV"100 Percent Berlin," Rimini Protokoll makes shows
p104
aVthat actually reflect society.
p105
aVRimini Protokoll chooses 100 people that represent that city
p106
aVat that moment in terms of race and gender and class,
p107
aVthrough a careful process that begins three months before,
p108
aVand then those 100 people share stories about
p109
aVthemselves and their lives, and the whole thing
p110
aVbecomes a snapshot of that city at that moment.
p111
aVLIFT has always been a pioneer in the use of venues.
p112
aVThey understand that theater and performance
p113
aVcan happen anywhere.
p114
aVYou can do a show in a schoolroom,
p115
aVin an airport, \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p116
aVin a department store window.
p117
aa(lp118
VArtists are explorers. Who better to show us the city anew?
p119
aVArtists can take us to a far-flung part of the city
p120
aVthat we haven't explored, or they can take us into
p121
aVthat building that we pass every day but we never went into.
p122
aa(lp123
VAn artist, I think, can really show us people
p124
aVthat we might overlook in our lives.
p125
aVBack to Back is an Australian company of people
p126
aVwith intellectual disabilities. I saw their amazing show
p127
aVin New York at the Staten Island Ferry Terminal
p128
aVat rush hour.
p129
aVWe, the audience, were given headsets and seated
p130
aVon one side of the terminal.
p131
aVThe actors were right there in front of us,
p132
aVright there among the commuters,
p133
aVand we could hear them,
p134
aVbut we might not have otherwise seen them.
p135
aVSo Back to Back takes site-specific theater and uses it
p136
aVto gently remind us about who and what we choose
p137
aVto edit out of our daily lives.
p138
aa(lp139
VSo, the dialogue with the local and the global,
p140
aVthe audience as participant and player and protagonist,
p141
aVthe innovative use of site, all of these things
p142
aVcome to play in the amazing work
p143
aVof the fantastic French company Royal de Luxe.
p144
aVRoyal de Luxe's giant puppets come into a city
p145
aVand they live there for a few days.
p146
aa(lp147
VFor "The Sultan's Elephant," Royal de Luxe
p148
aVcame to central London and brought it to a standstill
p149
aVwith their story of a giant little girl and her friend,
p150
aVa time-traveling elephant.
p151
aVFor a few days, they transformed a massive city
p152
aVinto a community where endless possibility reigned.
p153
aVThe Guardian wrote, "If art is about transformation,
p154
aVthen there can be no more transformative experience.
p155
aVWhat 'The Sultan's Elephant' represents is no less
p156
aVthan an artistic occupation of the city
p157
aVand a reclamation of the streets for the people."
p158
aa(lp159
VWe can talk about the economic impacts of these festivals
p160
aVon their cities, but I'm much [more] interested in many more things,
p161
aVlike how a festival helps a city to express itself,
p162
aVhow it lets it come into its own.
p163
aVFestivals promote diversity,
p164
aVthey bring neighbors into dialogue,
p165
aVthey increase creativity,
p166
aVthey offer opportunities for civic pride,
p167
aVthey improve our general psychological well-being.
p168
aVIn short, they make cities better places to live.
p169
aa(lp170
VCase in point:
p171
aVWhen "The Sultan's Elephant" came to London
p172
aVjust nine months after 7/7, a Londoner wrote,
p173
aV"For the first time since the London bombings,
p174
aVmy daughter called up with that sparkle back in her voice.
p175
aVShe had gathered with others
p176
aVto watch 'The Sultan's Elephant,' and, you know,
p177
aVit just made all the difference."
p178
aVLyn Gardner in The Guardian has written
p179
aVthat a great festival can show us a map of the world,
p180
aVa map of the city and a map of ourselves,
p181
aVbut there is no one fixed festival model.
p182
aVI think what's so brilliant about the festivals,
p183
aVthe new festivals, is that they are really fully capturing
p184
aVthe complexity and the excitement
p185
aVof the way we all live today.
p186
aVThank you very much. (Applause)
