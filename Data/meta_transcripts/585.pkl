VI want to help you re-perceive what philanthropy is,
p4
aVwhat it could be,
p5
aVand what your relationship to it is.
p6
aVAnd in doing that, I want to offer you a vision,
p7
aVan imagined future, if you will,
p8
aVof how, as the poet Seamus Heaney has put it,
p9
aV"Once in a lifetime
p10
aVthe longed-for tidal wave of justice can rise up,
p11
aVand hope and history rhyme."
p12
aa(lp13
VI want to start with these word pairs here.
p14
aVWe all know which side of these we'd like to be on.
p15
aVWhen philanthropy was reinvented a century ago,
p16
aVwhen the foundation form was actually invented,
p17
aVthey didn't think of themselves on the wrong side of these either.
p18
aVIn fact they would never have thought of themselves
p19
aVas closed and set in their ways,
p20
aVas slow to respond to new challenges,
p21
aVas small and risk-averse.
p22
aVAnd in fact they weren't. They were reinventing charity in those times,
p23
aVwhat Rockefeller called "the business of benevolence."
p24
aVBut by the end of the 20th century,
p25
aVa new generation of critics and reformers
p26
aVhad come to see philanthropy just this way.
p27
aa(lp28
VThe thing to watch for
p29
aVas a global philanthropy industry comes about \u2014
p30
aVand that's exactly what is happening \u2014
p31
aVis how the aspiration is to flip
p32
aVthese old assumptions,
p33
aVfor philanthropy to become open and big
p34
aVand fast and connected, in service of the long term.
p35
aVThis entrepreneurial energy
p36
aVis emerging from many quarters.
p37
aVAnd it's driven and propelled forward by new leaders, like many of the people here,
p38
aVby new tools, like the ones we've seen here,
p39
aVand by new pressures.
p40
aa(lp41
VI've been following this change for quite a while now, and participating in it.
p42
aVThis report is our main public report.
p43
aVWhat it tells is the story of how today
p44
aVactually could be as historic
p45
aVas 100 years ago.
p46
aVWhat I want to do is share some of the coolest things
p47
aVthat are going on with you.
p48
aVAnd as I do that, I'm not going to dwell much
p49
aVon the very large philanthropy that everybody already knows about \u2014
p50
aVthe Gates or the Soros or the Google.
p51
aVInstead, what I want to do
p52
aVis talk about the philanthropy of all of us:
p53
aVthe democratization of philanthropy.
p54
aVThis is a moment in history when the average person
p55
aVhas more power than at any time.
p56
aa(lp57
VWhat I'm going to do is look at five categories of experiments,
p58
aVeach of which challenges an old assumption of philanthropy.
p59
aVThe first is mass collaboration, represented here by Wikipedia.
p60
aVNow, this may surprise you.
p61
aVBut remember, philanthropy is about giving of time and talent, not just money.
p62
aVClay Shirky, that great chronicler of everything networked,
p63
aVhas captured the assumption that this challenges
p64
aVin such a beautiful way.
p65
aVHe said, "We have lived in this world
p66
aVwhere little things are done for love
p67
aVand big things for money.
p68
aVNow we have Wikipedia.
p69
aVSuddenly big things can be done for love."
p70
aa(lp71
VWatch, this spring, for Paul Hawken's new book \u2014
p72
aVAuthor and entrepreneur many of you may know about.
p73
aVThe book is called "Blessed Unrest."
p74
aVAnd when it comes out, a series of wiki sites
p75
aVunder the label WISER, are going to launch at the same time.
p76
aVWISER stands for World Index
p77
aVfor Social and Environmental Responsibility.
p78
aVWISER sets out to document, link and empower
p79
aVwhat Paul calls the largest movement,
p80
aVand fastest-growing movement in human history:
p81
aVhumanity's collective immune response
p82
aVto today's threats.
p83
aVNow, all of these big things for love \u2014 experiments \u2014
p84
aVaren't going to take off.
p85
aVBut the ones that do
p86
aVare going to be the biggest, the most open,
p87
aVthe fastest, the most connected form of philanthropy in human history.
p88
aa(lp89
VSecond category is online philanthropy marketplaces.
p90
aVThis is, of course, to philanthropy
p91
aVwhat eBay and Amazon are to commerce.
p92
aVThink of it as peer-to-peer philanthropy.
p93
aVAnd this challenges yet another assumption,
p94
aVwhich is that organized philanthropy is only for the very wealthy.
p95
aVTake a look, if you haven't, at DonorsChoose.
p96
aVOmidyar Network has made a big investment in DonorsChoose.
p97
aVIt's one of the best known of these new marketplaces
p98
aVwhere a donor can go straight into a classroom
p99
aVand connect with what a teacher says they need.
p100
aVTake a look at Changing the Present,
p101
aVstarted by a TEDster, next time you need a wedding present or a holiday present.
p102
aVGiveIndia is for a whole country.
p103
aVAnd it goes on and on.
p104
aa(lp105
VThe third category is represented by Warren Buffet,
p106
aVwhich I call aggregated giving.
p107
aVIt's not just that Warren Buffet was so amazingly generous
p108
aVin that historic act last summer.
p109
aVIt's that he challenged another assumption,
p110
aVthat every giver should have his or her own
p111
aVfund or foundation.
p112
aVThere are now, today, so many new funds
p113
aVthat are aggregating giving and investing,
p114
aVbringing together people
p115
aVaround a common goal, to think bigger.
p116
aVOne of the best known is Acumen Fund, led by Jacqueline Novogratz,
p117
aVa TEDster who got a big boost here at TED.
p118
aVBut there are many others: New Profit in Cambridge,
p119
aVNew School's Venture Fund in Silicon Valley,
p120
aVVenture Philanthropy Partners in Washington,
p121
aVGlobal Fund for Women in San Francisco.
p122
aVTake a look at these.
p123
aVThese funds are to philanthropy
p124
aVwhat venture capital, private equity, and eventually mutual funds
p125
aVare to investing,
p126
aVbut with a twist \u2014
p127
aVbecause often a community forms around these funds,
p128
aVas it has at Acumen and other places.
p129
aa(lp130
VNow, imagine for a second
p131
aVthese first three types of experiments:
p132
aVmass collaboration, online marketplaces, aggregated giving.
p133
aVAnd understand how they help us re-perceive
p134
aVwhat organized philanthropy is.
p135
aVIt's not about foundations necessarily; it's about the rest of us.
p136
aVAnd imagine the mash-up, if you will, of these things, in the future,
p137
aVwhen these things come together in the experiments of the future \u2014
p138
aVimagine that somebody puts up, say,
p139
aV100 million dollars
p140
aVfor an inspiring goal \u2014
p141
aVthere were 21 gifts of 100 million dollars or more in the US last year,
p142
aVnot out of the question \u2014
p143
aVbut only puts it up if it's matched
p144
aVby millions of small gifts from around the globe,
p145
aVthereby engaging lots of people,
p146
aVand building visibility and engaging people
p147
aVin the goal that's stated.
p148
aa(lp149
VI'm going to look quickly at the fourth and fifth categories,
p150
aVwhich are innovation, competitions and social investing.
p151
aVThey're betting a visible competition, a prize,
p152
aVcan attract talent and money to some of the most difficult issues,
p153
aVand thereby speed the solution.
p154
aVThis tackles yet another assumption,
p155
aVthat the giver and the organization is at the center,
p156
aVas opposed to putting the problem at the center.
p157
aVYou can look to these innovators
p158
aVto help us especially with things that require
p159
aVtechnological or scientific solution.
p160
aa(lp161
VThat leaves the final category, social investing,
p162
aVwhich is really, anyway, the biggest of them all,
p163
aVrepresented here by Xigi.net.
p164
aVAnd this, of course, tackles the biggest assumption of all,
p165
aVthat business is business,
p166
aVand philanthropy is the vehicle of people who want to create change in the world.
p167
aVXigi is a new community site
p168
aVthat's built by the community,
p169
aVlinking and mapping this new social capital market.
p170
aVIt lists already 1,000 entities
p171
aVthat are offering debt and equity for social enterprise.
p172
aVSo we can look to these innovators
p173
aVto help us remember
p174
aVthat if we can leverage even a small amount of the capital
p175
aVthat seeks a return,
p176
aVthe good that can be driven could be astonishing.
p177
aa(lp178
VNow, what's really interesting here
p179
aVis that we're not thinking our way
p180
aVinto a new way of acting;
p181
aVwe're acting our way into a new way of thinking.
p182
aVPhilanthropy is reorganizing itself
p183
aVbefore our very eyes.
p184
aVAnd even though all of the experiments and all of the big givers
p185
aVdon't yet fulfill this aspiration,
p186
aVI think this is the new zeitgeist:
p187
aVopen, big, fast, connected,
p188
aVand, let us also hope, long.
p189
aVWe have got to realize that it is going to take a long time to do these things.
p190
aVIf we don't develop the stamina to stick with things \u2014
p191
aVwhatever it is you pick, stick with it \u2014
p192
aVall of this stuff is just going to be, you know, a fad.
p193
aa(lp194
VBut I'm really hopeful.
p195
aVAnd I'm hopeful because it's not only philanthropy
p196
aVthat's reorganizing itself,
p197
aVit's also whole other portions of the social sector,
p198
aVand of business,
p199
aVthat are busy challenging "business as usual."
p200
aVAnd everywhere I go, including here at TED,
p201
aVI feel that there is a new moral hunger
p202
aVthat is growing.
p203
aVWhat we're seeing is people really wrestling
p204
aVto describe what is this new thing that's happening.
p205
aVWords like "philanthrocapitalism,"
p206
aVand "natural capitalism," and "philanthroentrepreneur,"
p207
aVand "venture philanthropy."
p208
aVWe don't have a language for it yet.
p209
aVWhatever we call it,
p210
aVit's new, it's beginning,
p211
aVand I think it's gong to quite significant.
p212
aa(lp213
VAnd that's where my imagined future comes in,
p214
aVwhich I am going to call the social singularity.
p215
aVMany of you will realize that I'm ripping a bit off of the science fiction writer
p216
aVVernor Vinge's notion of a technological singularity,
p217
aVwhere a number of trends accelerate and converge
p218
aVand come together to create, really, a shockingly new reality.
p219
aVIt may be that the social singularity
p220
aVahead is the one that we fear the most:
p221
aVa convergence of catastrophes,
p222
aVof environmental degradation,
p223
aVof weapons of mass destruction, of pandemics,
p224
aVof poverty.
p225
aVThat's because
p226
aVour ability to confront the problems that we face
p227
aVhas not kept pace with our ability to create them.
p228
aVAnd as we've heard here,
p229
aVit is no exaggeration to say
p230
aVthat we hold the future of our civilization in our hands
p231
aVas never before.
p232
aa(lp233
VThe question is, is there a positive social singularity?
p234
aVIs there a frontier for us
p235
aVof how we live together?
p236
aVOur future doesn't have to be imagined.
p237
aVWe can create a future where hope and history rhyme.
p238
aVBut we have a problem.
p239
aVOur experience to date, both individually and collectively,
p240
aVhasn't prepared us for what we're going to need to do,
p241
aVor who we're going to need to be.
p242
aVWe are going to need
p243
aVa new generation of citizen leaders
p244
aVwilling to commit ourselves to growing and changing and learning
p245
aVas rapidly as possible.
p246
aVThat's why I have one last thing I want to show you.
p247
aa(lp248
VThis is a photograph taken about 100 years ago
p249
aVof my grandfather and great-grandfather.
p250
aVThis is a newspaper publisher and a banker.
p251
aVAnd they were great community leaders.
p252
aVAnd, yes, they were great philanthropists.
p253
aVI keep this photograph close by to me \u2014
p254
aVit's in my office \u2014
p255
aVbecause I've always felt a mystical connection to these two men,
p256
aVboth of whom I never knew.
p257
aVAnd so, in their honor,
p258
aVI want to offer you this blank slide.
p259
aVAnd I want you to imagine
p260
aVthat this a photograph of you.
p261
aVAnd I want you to think about the community
p262
aVthat you want to be part of creating.
p263
aVWhatever that means to you.
p264
aVAnd I want you to imagine
p265
aVthat it's 100 years from now,
p266
aVand your grandchild, or great-grandchild,
p267
aVor niece or nephew or god-child,
p268
aVis looking at this photograph of you.
p269
aVWhat is the story you most want for them to tell?
p270
aVThank you very much.
