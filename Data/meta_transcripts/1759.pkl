(lp2
(lp3
VThe writer George Eliot cautioned us that,
p4
aVamong all forms of mistake,
p5
aVprophesy is the most gratuitous.
p6
aVThe person that we would all acknowledge
p7
aVas her 20th-century counterpart, Yogi Berra, agreed.
p8
aVHe said, "It's tough to make predictions,
p9
aVespecially about the future."
p10
aa(lp11
VI'm going to ignore their cautions
p12
aVand make one very specific forecast.
p13
aVIn the world that we are creating very quickly,
p14
aVwe're going to see more and more things
p15
aVthat look like science fiction,
p16
aVand fewer and fewer things that look like jobs.
p17
aVOur cars are very quickly going to start driving themselves,
p18
aVwhich means we're going to need fewer truck drivers.
p19
aVWe're going to hook Siri up to Watson
p20
aVand use that to automate a lot of the work
p21
aVthat's currently done by customer service reps
p22
aVand troubleshooters and diagnosers,
p23
aVand we're already taking R2D2,
p24
aVpainting him orange, and putting him to work
p25
aVcarrying shelves around warehouses,
p26
aVwhich means we need a lot fewer people
p27
aVto be walking up and down those aisles.
p28
aa(lp29
VNow, for about 200 years,
p30
aVpeople have been saying exactly what I'm telling you \u2014
p31
aVthe age of technological unemployment is at hand \u2014
p32
aVstarting with the Luddites smashing looms in Britain
p33
aVjust about two centuries ago,
p34
aVand they have been wrong.
p35
aVOur economies in the developed world have coasted along
p36
aVon something pretty close to full employment.
p37
aa(lp38
VWhich brings up a critical question:
p39
aVWhy is this time different, if it really is?
p40
aVThe reason it's different is that, just in the past few years,
p41
aVour machines have started demonstrating skills
p42
aVthey have never, ever had before:
p43
aVunderstanding, speaking, hearing, seeing,
p44
aVanswering, writing, and they're still acquiring new skills.
p45
aVFor example, mobile humanoid robots
p46
aVare still incredibly primitive,
p47
aVbut the research arm of the Defense Department
p48
aVjust launched a competition
p49
aVto have them do things like this,
p50
aVand if the track record is any guide,
p51
aVthis competition is going to be successful.
p52
aVSo when I look around, I think the day is not too far off at all
p53
aVwhen we're going to have androids
p54
aVdoing a lot of the work that we are doing right now.
p55
aVAnd we're creating a world where there is going to be
p56
aVmore and more technology and fewer and fewer jobs.
p57
aVIt's a world that Erik Brynjolfsson and I are calling
p58
aV"the new machine age."
p59
aa(lp60
VThe thing to keep in mind is that
p61
aVthis is absolutely great news.
p62
aVThis is the best economic news on the planet these days.
p63
aVNot that there's a lot of competition, right?
p64
aVThis is the best economic news we have these days
p65
aVfor two main reasons.
p66
aVThe first is, technological progress is what allows us
p67
aVto continue this amazing recent run that we're on
p68
aVwhere output goes up over time,
p69
aVwhile at the same time, prices go down,
p70
aVand volume and quality just continue to explode.
p71
aVNow, some people look at this and talk about
p72
aVshallow materialism,
p73
aVbut that's absolutely the wrong way to look at it.
p74
aVThis is abundance, which is exactly
p75
aVwhat we want our economic system to provide.
p76
aVThe second reason that the new machine age
p77
aVis such great news is that, once the androids
p78
aVstart doing jobs, we don't have to do them anymore,
p79
aVand we get freed up from drudgery and toil.
p80
aa(lp81
VNow, when I talk about this with my friends
p82
aVin Cambridge and Silicon Valley, they say,
p83
aV"Fantastic. No more drudgery, no more toil.
p84
aVThis gives us the chance to imagine
p85
aVan entirely different kind of society,
p86
aVa society where the creators and the discoverers
p87
aVand the performers and the innovators
p88
aVcome together with their patrons and their financiers
p89
aVto talk about issues, entertain, enlighten,
p90
aVprovoke each other."
p91
aVIt's a society really, that looks a lot like the TED Conference.
p92
aVAnd there's actually a huge amount of truth here.
p93
aVWe are seeing an amazing flourishing taking place.
p94
aVIn a world where it is just about as easy
p95
aVto generate an object as it is to print a document,
p96
aVwe have amazing new possibilities.
p97
aVThe people who used to be craftsmen and hobbyists
p98
aVare now makers, and they're responsible
p99
aVfor massive amounts of innovation.
p100
aVAnd artists who were formerly constrained
p101
aVcan now do things that were never, ever possible
p102
aVfor them before.
p103
aVSo this is a time of great flourishing,
p104
aVand the more I look around, the more convinced I become
p105
aVthat this quote, from the physicist Freeman Dyson,
p106
aVis not hyperbole at all.
p107
aVThis is just a plain statement of the facts.
p108
aVWe are in the middle of an astonishing period.
p109
aa(lp110
V["Technology is a gift of God. After the gift of life it is perhaps the greatest of God's gifts. It is the mother of civilizations, of arts and of sciences." \u2014 Freeman Dyson]
p111
aa(lp112
VWhich brings up another great question:
p113
aVWhat could possibly go wrong in this new machine age?
p114
aVRight? Great, hang up, flourish, go home.
p115
aVWe're going to face two really thorny sets of challenges
p116
aVas we head deeper into the future that we're creating.
p117
aa(lp118
VThe first are economic, and they're really nicely summarized
p119
aVin an apocryphal story about a back-and-forth
p120
aVbetween Henry Ford II and Walter Reuther,
p121
aVwho was the head of the auto workers union.
p122
aVThey were touring one of the new modern factories,
p123
aVand Ford playfully turns to Reuther and says,
p124
aV"Hey Walter, how are you going to get these robots
p125
aVto pay union dues?"
p126
aVAnd Reuther shoots back, "Hey Henry,
p127
aVhow are you going to get them to buy cars?"
p128
aa(lp129
VReuther's problem in that anecdote
p130
aVis that it is tough to offer your labor to an economy
p131
aVthat's full of machines,
p132
aVand we see this very clearly in the statistics.
p133
aVIf you look over the past couple decades
p134
aVat the returns to capital \u2014 in other words, corporate profits \u2014
p135
aVwe see them going up,
p136
aVand we see that they're now at an all-time high.
p137
aVIf we look at the returns to labor, in other words
p138
aVtotal wages paid out in the economy,
p139
aVwe see them at an all-time low
p140
aVand heading very quickly in the opposite direction.
p141
aa(lp142
VSo this is clearly bad news for Reuther.
p143
aVIt looks like it might be great news for Ford,
p144
aVbut it's actually not. If you want to sell
p145
aVhuge volumes of somewhat expensive goods to people,
p146
aVyou really want a large, stable, prosperous middle class.
p147
aVWe have had one of those in America
p148
aVfor just about the entire postwar period.
p149
aVBut the middle class is clearly under huge threat right now.
p150
aVWe all know a lot of the statistics,
p151
aVbut just to repeat one of them,
p152
aVmedian income in America has actually gone down
p153
aVover the past 15 years,
p154
aVand we're in danger of getting trapped
p155
aVin some vicious cycle where inequality and polarization
p156
aVcontinue to go up over time.
p157
aa(lp158
VThe societal challenges that come along
p159
aVwith that kind of inequality deserve some attention.
p160
aVThere are a set of societal challenges
p161
aVthat I'm actually not that worried about,
p162
aVand they're captured by images like this.
p163
aVThis is not the kind of societal problem
p164
aVthat I am concerned about.
p165
aVThere is no shortage of dystopian visions
p166
aVabout what happens when our machines become self-aware,
p167
aVand they decide to rise up and coordinate attacks against us.
p168
aVI'm going to start worrying about those
p169
aVthe day my computer becomes aware of my printer.
p170
aa(lp171
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p172
aa(lp173
VSo this is not the set of challenges we really need to worry about.
p174
aVTo tell you the kinds of societal challenges
p175
aVthat are going to come up in the new machine age,
p176
aVI want to tell a story about two stereotypical American workers.
p177
aVAnd to make them really stereotypical,
p178
aVlet's make them both white guys.
p179
aVAnd the first one is a college-educated
p180
aVprofessional, creative type, manager,
p181
aVengineer, doctor, lawyer, that kind of worker.
p182
aVWe're going to call him "Ted."
p183
aVHe's at the top of the American middle class.
p184
aVHis counterpart is not college-educated
p185
aVand works as a laborer, works as a clerk,
p186
aVdoes low-level white collar or blue collar work in the economy.
p187
aVWe're going to call that guy "Bill."
p188
aa(lp189
VAnd if you go back about 50 years,
p190
aVBill and Ted were leading remarkably similar lives.
p191
aVFor example, in 1960 they were both very likely
p192
aVto have full-time jobs, working at least 40 hours a week.
p193
aVBut as the social researcher Charles Murray has documented,
p194
aVas we started to automate the economy,
p195
aVand 1960 is just about when computers started to be used by businesses,
p196
aVas we started to progressively inject technology
p197
aVand automation and digital stuff into the economy,
p198
aVthe fortunes of Bill and Ted diverged a lot.
p199
aVOver this time frame, Ted has continued
p200
aVto hold a full-time job. Bill hasn't.
p201
aVIn many cases, Bill has left the economy entirely,
p202
aVand Ted very rarely has.
p203
aVOver time, Ted's marriage has stayed quite happy.
p204
aVBill's hasn't.
p205
aVAnd Ted's kids have grown up in a two-parent home,
p206
aVwhile Bill's absolutely have not over time.
p207
aVOther ways that Bill is dropping out of society?
p208
aVHe's decreased his voting in presidential elections,
p209
aVand he's started to go to prison a lot more often.
p210
aVSo I cannot tell a happy story about these social trends,
p211
aVand they don't show any signs of reversing themselves.
p212
aVThey're also true no matter which ethnic group
p213
aVor demographic group we look at,
p214
aVand they're actually getting so severe
p215
aVthat they're in danger of overwhelming
p216
aVeven the amazing progress we made with the Civil Rights Movement.
p217
aa(lp218
VAnd what my friends in Silicon Valley
p219
aVand Cambridge are overlooking is that they're Ted.
p220
aVThey're living these amazingly busy, productive lives,
p221
aVand they've got all the benefits to show from that,
p222
aVwhile Bill is leading a very different life.
p223
aVThey're actually both proof of how right Voltaire was
p224
aVwhen he talked about the benefits of work,
p225
aVand the fact that it saves us from not one but three great evils.
p226
aa(lp227
V["Work saves a man from three great evils: boredom, vice and need." \u2014 Voltaire]
p228
aa(lp229
VSo with these challenges, what do we do about them?
p230
aa(lp231
VThe economic playbook is surprisingly clear,
p232
aVsurprisingly straightforward, in the short term especially.
p233
aVThe robots are not going to take all of our jobs in the next year or two,
p234
aVso the classic Econ 101 playbook is going to work just fine:
p235
aVEncourage entrepreneurship,
p236
aVdouble down on infrastructure,
p237
aVand make sure we're turning out people
p238
aVfrom our educational system with the appropriate skills.
p239
aa(lp240
VBut over the longer term, if we are moving into an economy
p241
aVthat's heavy on technology and light on labor,
p242
aVand we are, then we have to consider
p243
aVsome more radical interventions,
p244
aVfor example, something like a guaranteed minimum income.
p245
aVNow, that's probably making some folk in this room uncomfortable,
p246
aVbecause that idea is associated with the extreme left wing
p247
aVand with fairly radical schemes for redistributing wealth.
p248
aVI did a little bit of research on this notion,
p249
aVand it might calm some folk down to know that
p250
aVthe idea of a net guaranteed minimum income
p251
aVhas been championed by those frothing-at-the-mouth socialists
p252
aVFriedrich Hayek, Richard Nixon and Milton Friedman.
p253
aVAnd if you find yourself worried
p254
aVthat something like a guaranteed income
p255
aVis going to stifle our drive to succeed
p256
aVand make us kind of complacent,
p257
aVyou might be interested to know that social mobility,
p258
aVone of the things we really pride ourselves on in the United States,
p259
aVis now lower than it is in the northern European countries
p260
aVthat have these very generous social safety nets.
p261
aVSo the economic playbook is actually pretty straightforward.
p262
aa(lp263
VThe societal one is a lot more challenging.
p264
aVI don't know what the playbook is
p265
aVfor getting Bill to engage and stay engaged throughout life.
p266
aa(lp267
VI do know that education is a huge part of it.
p268
aVI witnessed this firsthand.
p269
aVI was a Montessori kid for the first few years of my education,
p270
aVand what that education taught me
p271
aVis that the world is an interesting place
p272
aVand my job is to go explore it.
p273
aVThe school stopped in third grade,
p274
aVso then I entered the public school system,
p275
aVand it felt like I had been sent to the Gulag.
p276
aVWith the benefit of hindsight, I now know the job
p277
aVwas to prepare me for life as a clerk or a laborer,
p278
aVbut at the time it felt like the job was to kind of
p279
aVbore me into some submission with what was going on around me.
p280
aVWe have to do better than this.
p281
aVWe cannot keep turning out Bills.
p282
aa(lp283
VSo we see some green shoots that things are getting better.
p284
aVWe see technology deeply impacting education
p285
aVand engaging people, from our youngest learners
p286
aVup to our oldest ones.
p287
aVWe see very prominent business voices telling us
p288
aVwe need to rethink some of the things that we've been holding dear for a while.
p289
aVAnd we see very serious and sustained
p290
aVand data-driven efforts to understand
p291
aVhow to intervene in some of the most troubled communities that we have.
p292
aa(lp293
VSo the green shoots are out there.
p294
aVI don't want to pretend for a minute
p295
aVthat what we have is going to be enough.
p296
aVWe're facing very tough challenges.
p297
aVTo give just one example, there are about five million Americans
p298
aVwho have been unemployed for at least six months.
p299
aVWe're not going to fix things for them
p300
aVby sending them back to Montessori.
p301
aVAnd my biggest worry is that we're creating a world
p302
aVwhere we're going to have glittering technologies
p303
aVembedded in kind of a shabby society
p304
aVand supported by an economy that generates inequality
p305
aVinstead of opportunity.
p306
aa(lp307
VBut I actually don't think that's what we're going to do.
p308
aVI think we're going to do something a lot better
p309
aVfor one very straightforward reason:
p310
aVThe facts are getting out there.
p311
aVThe realities of this new machine age
p312
aVand the change in the economy are becoming more widely known.
p313
aVIf we wanted to accelerate that process, we could do things
p314
aVlike have our best economists and policymakers
p315
aVplay "Jeopardy!" against Watson.
p316
aVWe could send Congress on an autonomous car road trip.
p317
aVAnd if we do enough of these kinds of things,
p318
aVthe awareness is going to sink in that things are going to be different.
p319
aVAnd then we're off to the races,
p320
aVbecause I don't believe for a second
p321
aVthat we have forgotten how to solve tough challenges
p322
aVor that we have become too apathetic or hard-hearted to even try.
p323
aa(lp324
VI started my talk with quotes from wordsmiths
p325
aVwho were separated by an ocean and a century.
p326
aVLet me end it with words from politicians
p327
aVwho were similarly distant.
p328
aa(lp329
VWinston Churchill came to my home of MIT in 1949,
p330
aVand he said, "If we are to bring the broad masses
p331
aVof the people in every land to the table of abundance,
p332
aVit can only be by the tireless improvement
p333
aVof all of our means of technical production."
p334
aa(lp335
VAbraham Lincoln realized there was one other ingredient.
p336
aVHe said, "I am a firm believer in the people.
p337
aVIf given the truth, they can be depended upon
p338
aVto meet any national crisis.
p339
aVThe great point is to give them the plain facts."
p340
aa(lp341
VSo the optimistic note, great point that I want to leave you with
p342
aVis that the plain facts of the machine age are becoming clear,
p343
aVand I have every confidence that we're going to use them
p344
aVto chart a good course into the challenging,
p345
aVabundant economy that we're creating.
p346
aa(lp347
