VSo, I've known a lot of fish in my life.
p4
aVI've loved only two.
p5
aVThat first one,
p6
aVit was more like a passionate affair.
p7
aVIt was a beautiful fish:
p8
aVflavorful, textured, meaty,
p9
aVa bestseller on the menu.
p10
aVWhat a fish.
p11
aV(Laughter)
p12
aVEven better,
p13
aVit was farm-raised to the supposed highest standards
p14
aVof sustainability.
p15
aVSo you could feel good about selling it.
p16
aa(lp17
VI was in a relationship with this beauty
p18
aVfor several months.
p19
aVOne day, the head of the company called
p20
aVand asked if I'd speak at an event
p21
aVabout the farm's sustainability.
p22
aV"Absolutely," I said.
p23
aVHere was a company trying to solve
p24
aVwhat's become this unimaginable problem for us chefs:
p25
aVHow do we keep fish on our menus?
p26
aa(lp27
VFor the past 50 years,
p28
aVwe've been fishing the seas
p29
aVlike we clear-cut forests.
p30
aVIt's hard to overstate the destruction.
p31
aVNinety percent of large fish, the ones we love \u2014
p32
aVthe tunas, the halibuts, the salmons, swordfish \u2014
p33
aVthey've collapsed.
p34
aVThere's almost nothing left.
p35
aVSo, for better or for worse,
p36
aVaquaculture, fish farming, is going to be a part of our future.
p37
aVA lot of arguments against it:
p38
aVFish farms pollute \u2014 most of them do anyway \u2014
p39
aVand they're inefficient. Take tuna,
p40
aVa major drawback.
p41
aVIt's got a feed conversion ratio
p42
aVof 15 to one.
p43
aVThat means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish
p44
aVto get you one pound of farm tuna.
p45
aVNot very sustainable.
p46
aVIt doesn't taste very good either.
p47
aa(lp48
VSo here, finally,
p49
aVwas a company trying to do it right.
p50
aVI wanted to support them.
p51
aVThe day before the event,
p52
aVI called the head of P.R. for the company.
p53
aVLet's call him Don.
p54
aa(lp55
V"Don," I said, "just to get the facts straight, you guys are famous
p56
aVfor farming so far out to sea, you don't pollute."
p57
aa(lp58
V"That's right," he said. "We're so far out,
p59
aVthe waste from our fish gets distributed,
p60
aVnot concentrated."
p61
aVAnd then he added,
p62
aV"We're basically a world unto ourselves.
p63
aVThat feed conversion ratio? 2.5 to one," he said.
p64
aV"Best in the business."
p65
aa(lp66
V2.5 to one, great.
p67
aV"2.5 what? What are you feeding?"
p68
aa(lp69
V"Sustainable proteins," he said.
p70
aa(lp71
V"Great," I said. Got off the phone.
p72
aVAnd that night, I was lying in bed, and I thought:
p73
aVWhat the hell is a sustainable protein?
p74
aV(Laughter)
p75
aa(lp76
VSo the next day, just before the event, I called Don.
p77
aVI said, "Don, what are some examples of sustainable proteins?"
p78
aa(lp79
VHe said he didn't know. He would ask around.
p80
aVWell, I got on the phone with a few people in the company;
p81
aVno one could give me a straight answer
p82
aVuntil finally, I got on the phone
p83
aVwith the head biologist.
p84
aVLet's call him Don too.
p85
aV(Laughter)
p86
aa(lp87
V"Don," I said,
p88
aV"what are some examples of sustainable proteins?"
p89
aa(lp90
VWell, he mentioned some algaes
p91
aVand some fish meals,
p92
aVand then he said chicken pellets.
p93
aVI said, "Chicken pellets?"
p94
aa(lp95
VHe said, "Yeah, feathers, skin,
p96
aVbone meal, scraps,
p97
aVdried and processed into feed."
p98
aa(lp99
VI said, "What percentage
p100
aVof your feed is chicken?"
p101
aVThinking, you know, two percent.
p102
aa(lp103
V"Well, it's about 30 percent," he said.
p104
aa(lp105
VI said, "Don, what's sustainable
p106
aVabout feeding chicken to fish?"
p107
aV(Laughter)
p108
aa(lp109
VThere was a long pause on the line,
p110
aVand he said, "There's just too much chicken in the world."
p111
aV(Laughter)
p112
aa(lp113
VI fell out of love with this fish.
p114
aV(Laughter)
p115
aVNo, not because I'm some self-righteous,
p116
aVgoody-two shoes foodie.
p117
aVI actually am.
p118
aV(Laughter)
p119
aVNo, I actually fell out of love with this fish because, I swear to God,
p120
aVafter that conversation, the fish tasted like chicken.
p121
aV(Laughter)
p122
aa(lp123
VThis second fish,
p124
aVit's a different kind of love story.
p125
aVIt's the romantic kind,
p126
aVthe kind where the more you get to know your fish,
p127
aVyou love the fish.
p128
aVI first ate it at a restaurant
p129
aVin southern Spain.
p130
aVA journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time.
p131
aVShe kind of set us up.
p132
aV(Laughter)
p133
aVIt came to the table
p134
aVa bright, almost shimmering, white color.
p135
aVThe chef had overcooked it.
p136
aVLike twice over.
p137
aVAmazingly, it was still delicious.
p138
aa(lp139
VWho can make a fish taste good
p140
aVafter it's been overcooked?
p141
aVI can't,
p142
aVbut this guy can.
p143
aVLet's call him Miguel \u2014
p144
aVactually his name is Miguel.
p145
aV(Laughter)
p146
aVAnd no, he didn't cook the fish, and he's not a chef,
p147
aVat least in the way that you and I understand it.
p148
aVHe's a biologist
p149
aVat Veta La Palma.
p150
aVIt's a fish farm in the southwestern corner of Spain.
p151
aVIt's at the tip of the Guadalquivir river.
p152
aa(lp153
VUntil the 1980s,
p154
aVthe farm was in the hands of the Argentinians.
p155
aVThey raised beef cattle
p156
aVon what was essentially wetlands.
p157
aVThey did it by draining the land.
p158
aVThey built this intricate series of canals,
p159
aVand they pushed water off the land and out into the river.
p160
aVWell, they couldn't make it work,
p161
aVnot economically.
p162
aVAnd ecologically, it was a disaster.
p163
aVIt killed like 90 percent of the birds,
p164
aVwhich, for this place, is a lot of birds.
p165
aVAnd so in 1982,
p166
aVa Spanish company with an environmental conscience
p167
aVpurchased the land.
p168
aa(lp169
VWhat did they do?
p170
aVThey reversed the flow of water.
p171
aVThey literally flipped the switch.
p172
aVInstead of pushing water out,
p173
aVthey used the channels to pull water back in.
p174
aVThey flooded the canals.
p175
aVThey created a 27,000-acre fish farm \u2014
p176
aVbass, mullet,
p177
aVshrimp, eel \u2014
p178
aVand in the process, Miguel and this company
p179
aVcompletely reversed the ecological destruction.
p180
aVThe farm's incredible.
p181
aVI mean, you've never seen anything like this.
p182
aVYou stare out at a horizon
p183
aVthat is a million miles away,
p184
aVand all you see are flooded canals
p185
aVand this thick, rich marshland.
p186
aa(lp187
VI was there not long ago with Miguel.
p188
aVHe's an amazing guy,
p189
aVlike three parts Charles Darwin and one part Crocodile Dundee.
p190
aV(Laughter)
p191
aVOkay? There we are slogging through the wetlands,
p192
aVand I'm panting and sweating, got mud up to my knees,
p193
aVand Miguel's calmly conducting a biology lecture.
p194
aVHere, he's pointing out a rare Black-shouldered Kite.
p195
aVNow, he's mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplankton.
p196
aVAnd here, here he sees a grouping pattern
p197
aVthat reminds him of the Tanzanian Giraffe.
p198
aa(lp199
VIt turns out, Miguel spent the better part of his career
p200
aVin the Mikumi National Park in Africa.
p201
aVI asked him how he became
p202
aVsuch an expert on fish.
p203
aa(lp204
VHe said, "Fish? I didn't know anything about fish.
p205
aVI'm an expert in relationships."
p206
aVAnd then he's off, launching into more talk
p207
aVabout rare birds and algaes
p208
aVand strange aquatic plants.
p209
aa(lp210
VAnd don't get me wrong, that was really fascinating, you know,
p211
aVthe biotic community unplugged, kind of thing.
p212
aVIt's great, but I was in love.
p213
aVAnd my head was swooning over that
p214
aVovercooked piece of delicious fish I had the night before.
p215
aVSo I interrupted him. I said,
p216
aV"Miguel, what makes your fish taste so good?"
p217
aa(lp218
VHe pointed at the algae.
p219
aa(lp220
V"I know, dude, the algae, the phytoplankton,
p221
aVthe relationships: It's amazing.
p222
aVBut what are your fish eating?
p223
aVWhat's the feed conversion ratio?"
p224
aa(lp225
VWell, he goes on to tell me
p226
aVit's such a rich system
p227
aVthat the fish are eating what they'd be eating in the wild.
p228
aVThe plant biomass, the phytoplankton,
p229
aVthe zooplankton, it's what feeds the fish.
p230
aVThe system is so healthy,
p231
aVit's totally self-renewing.
p232
aVThere is no feed.
p233
aVEver heard of a farm that doesn't feed its animals?
p234
aa(lp235
VLater that day, I was driving around this property with Miguel,
p236
aVand I asked him, I said, "For a place that seems so natural,
p237
aVunlike like any farm I'd ever been at,
p238
aVhow do you measure success?"
p239
aa(lp240
VAt that moment, it was as if
p241
aVa film director called for a set change.
p242
aVAnd we rounded the corner
p243
aVand saw the most amazing sight:
p244
aVthousands and thousands of pink flamingos,
p245
aVa literal pink carpet for as far as you could see.
p246
aa(lp247
V"That's success," he said.
p248
aV"Look at their bellies, pink.
p249
aVThey're feasting."
p250
aVFeasting? I was totally confused.
p251
aa(lp252
VI said, "Miguel, aren't they feasting on your fish?"
p253
aV(Laughter)
p254
aa(lp255
V"Yes," he said.
p256
aV(Laughter)
p257
aV"We lose 20 percent of our fish
p258
aVand fish eggs to birds.
p259
aVWell, last year, this property
p260
aVhad 600,000 birds on it,
p261
aVmore than 250 different species.
p262
aVIt's become, today, the largest
p263
aVand one of the most important
p264
aVprivate bird sanctuaries in all of Europe."
p265
aa(lp266
VI said, "Miguel, isn't a thriving bird population
p267
aVlike the last thing you want on a fish farm?"
p268
aV(Laughter)
p269
aVHe shook his head, no.
p270
aa(lp271
VHe said, "We farm extensively,
p272
aVnot intensively.
p273
aVThis is an ecological network.
p274
aVThe flamingos eat the shrimp.
p275
aVThe shrimp eat the phytoplankton.
p276
aVSo the pinker the belly,
p277
aVthe better the system."
p278
aa(lp279
VOkay, so let's review:
p280
aVa farm that doesn't feed its animals,
p281
aVand a farm that measures its success
p282
aVon the health of its predators.
p283
aVA fish farm, but also a bird sanctuary.
p284
aVOh, and by the way, those flamingos,
p285
aVthey shouldn't even be there in the first place.
p286
aVThey brood in a town
p287
aV150 miles away,
p288
aVwhere the soil conditions
p289
aVare better for building nests.
p290
aVEvery morning, they fly
p291
aV150 miles into the farm.
p292
aVAnd every evening, they fly 150 miles back.
p293
aV(Laughter)
p294
aVThey do that because they're able to follow
p295
aVthe broken white line
p296
aVof highway A92.
p297
aV(Laughter)
p298
aVNo kidding.
p299
aa(lp300
VI was imagining a "March of the Penguins" thing,
p301
aVso I looked at Miguel.
p302
aVI said, "Miguel, do they fly
p303
aV150 miles to the farm,
p304
aVand then do they fly
p305
aV150 miles back at night?
p306
aVDo they do that for the children?"
p307
aa(lp308
VHe looked at me like I had just quoted a Whitney Houston song.
p309
aV(Laughter)
p310
aVHe said, "No; they do it because the food's better."
p311
aV(Laughter)
p312
aa(lp313
VI didn't mention the skin of my beloved fish,
p314
aVwhich was delicious \u2014 and I don't like fish skin;
p315
aVI don't like it seared, I don't like it crispy.
p316
aVIt's that acrid, tar-like flavor.
p317
aVI almost never cook with it.
p318
aVYet, when I tasted it at that restaurant in southern Spain,
p319
aVit tasted not at all like fish skin.
p320
aVIt tasted sweet and clean,
p321
aVlike you were taking a bite of the ocean.
p322
aVI mentioned that to Miguel, and he nodded.
p323
aVHe said, "The skin acts like a sponge.
p324
aVIt's the last defense before anything enters the body.
p325
aVIt evolved to soak up impurities."
p326
aVAnd then he added,
p327
aV"But our water has no impurities."
p328
aa(lp329
VOK. A farm that doesn't feed its fish,
p330
aVa farm that measures its success
p331
aVby the success of its predators.
p332
aVAnd then I realized when he says,
p333
aV"A farm that has no impurities,"
p334
aVhe made a big understatement,
p335
aVbecause the water that flows through that farm
p336
aVcomes in from the Guadalquivir River.
p337
aVIt's a river that carries with it
p338
aVall the things that rivers tend to carry these days:
p339
aVchemical contaminants,
p340
aVpesticide runoff.
p341
aVAnd when it works its way through the system
p342
aVand leaves,
p343
aVthe water is cleaner than when it entered.
p344
aVThe system is so healthy, it purifies the water.
p345
aVSo, not just a farm that doesn't feed its animals,
p346
aVnot just a farm that measures its success
p347
aVby the health of its predators,
p348
aVbut a farm that's literally a water purification plant \u2014
p349
aVand not just for those fish,
p350
aVbut for you and me as well.
p351
aVBecause when that water leaves, it dumps out into the Atlantic.
p352
aVA drop in the ocean, I know,
p353
aVbut I'll take it, and so should you,
p354
aVbecause this love story,
p355
aVhowever romantic,
p356
aVis also instructive.
p357
aVYou might say it's a recipe
p358
aVfor the future of good food,
p359
aVwhether we're talking about bass or beef cattle.
p360
aa(lp361
VWhat we need now is
p362
aVa radically new conception of agriculture,
p363
aVone in which the food actually tastes good.
p364
aV(Laughter)
p365
aV(Applause)
p366
aVBut for a lot people,
p367
aVthat's a bit too radical.
p368
aVWe're not realists, us foodies;
p369
aVwe're lovers.
p370
aVWe love farmers' markets,
p371
aVwe love small family farms,
p372
aVwe talk about local food,
p373
aVwe eat organic.
p374
aVAnd when you suggest these are the things
p375
aVthat will ensure the future of good food,
p376
aVsomeone, somewhere stands up and says,
p377
aV"Hey guy, I love pink flamingos,
p378
aVbut how are you going to feed the world?"
p379
aVHow are you going to feed the world?
p380
aa(lp381
VCan I be honest?
p382
aVI don't love that question.
p383
aVNo, not because we already produce
p384
aVenough calories to more than feed the world.
p385
aVOne billion people will go hungry today.
p386
aVOne billion \u2014 that's more than ever before \u2014
p387
aVbecause of gross inequalities in distribution,
p388
aVnot tonnage.
p389
aVNow, I don't love this question because it's determined the logic
p390
aVof our food system for the last 50 years.
p391
aa(lp392
VFeed grain to herbivores,
p393
aVpesticides to monocultures, chemicals to soil,
p394
aVchicken to fish,
p395
aVand all along agribusiness
p396
aVhas simply asked,
p397
aV"If we're feeding more people more cheaply,
p398
aVhow terrible could that be?"
p399
aVThat's been the motivation,
p400
aVit's been the justification:
p401
aVit's been the business plan
p402
aVof American agriculture.
p403
aVWe should call it what it is:
p404
aVa business in liquidation,
p405
aVa business that's quickly eroding
p406
aVecological capital that makes that very production possible.
p407
aVThat's not a business,
p408
aVand it isn't agriculture.
p409
aa(lp410
VOur breadbasket is threatened today,
p411
aVnot because of diminishing supply,
p412
aVbut because of diminishing resources.
p413
aVNot by the latest combine and tractor invention,
p414
aVbut by fertile land;
p415
aVnot by pumps, but by fresh water;
p416
aVnot by chainsaws, but by forests;
p417
aVand not by fishing boats and nets, but by fish in the sea.
p418
aa(lp419
VWant to feed the world?
p420
aVLet's start by asking: How are we going to feed ourselves?
p421
aVOr better: How can we create conditions
p422
aVthat enable every community
p423
aVto feed itself?
p424
aV(Applause)
p425
aVTo do that,
p426
aVdon't look at the agribusiness model for the future.
p427
aVIt's really old, and it's tired.
p428
aVIt's high on capital, chemistry and machines,
p429
aVand it's never produced anything really good to eat.
p430
aVInstead, let's look to the ecological model.
p431
aVThat's the one that relies on two billion years
p432
aVof on-the-job experience.
p433
aa(lp434
VLook to Miguel,
p435
aVfarmers like Miguel.
p436
aVFarms that aren't worlds unto themselves;
p437
aVfarms that restore instead of deplete;
p438
aVfarms that farm extensively
p439
aVinstead of just intensively;
p440
aVfarmers that are not just producers,
p441
aVbut experts in relationships.
p442
aVBecause they're the ones
p443
aVthat are experts in flavor, too.
p444
aVAnd if I'm going to be really honest,
p445
aVthey're a better chef than I'll ever be.
p446
aVYou know, I'm okay with that,
p447
aVbecause if that's the future of good food, it's going to be delicious.
p448
