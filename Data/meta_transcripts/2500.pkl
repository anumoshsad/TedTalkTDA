VToday, I am going to show you
p4
aVhow this tablet and this virtual-reality headset that I'm wearing
p5
aVare going to completely revolutionize science education.
p6
aVAnd I'm also going to show you
p7
aVhow it can make any science teacher more than twice as effective.
p8
aVBut before I show you how all of this is possible,
p9
aVlet's talk briefly about why improving the quality of science education
p10
aVis so vitally important.
p11
aa(lp12
VIf you think about it,
p13
aVthe world is growing incredibly fast.
p14
aVAnd with that growth comes a whole list of growing challenges,
p15
aVchallenges such as dealing with global warming,
p16
aVsolving starvation and water shortages
p17
aVand curing diseases,
p18
aVto name just a few.
p19
aa(lp20
VAnd who, exactly, is going to help us solve all of these great challenges?
p21
aVWell, to a very last degree, it is these young students.
p22
aVThis is the next generation of young, bright scientists.
p23
aVAnd in many ways, we all rely on them
p24
aVfor coming up with new, great innovations
p25
aVto help us solve all these challenges ahead of us.
p26
aVAnd so a couple of years back,
p27
aVmy cofounder and I were teaching university students just like these,
p28
aVonly the students we were teaching looked a little bit more like this here.
p29
aa(lp30
V(Laughter)
p31
aa(lp32
VAnd yes, this is really the reality out there
p33
aVin way too many universities around the world:
p34
aVstudents that are bored, disengaged
p35
aVand sometimes not even sure why they're learning about a topic
p36
aVin the first place.
p37
aa(lp38
VSo we started looking around for new, innovative teaching methods,
p39
aVbut what we found was quite disappointing.
p40
aVWe saw that books were being turned into e-books,
p41
aVblackboards were being turned into YouTube videos
p42
aVand lecture hall monologues were being turned into MOOCs \u2014
p43
aVmassive online open courses.
p44
aVAnd if you think about it,
p45
aVall we're really doing here is taking the same content
p46
aVand the same format,
p47
aVand bringing it out to more students \u2014
p48
aVwhich is great, don't get me wrong, that is really great \u2014
p49
aVbut the teaching method is still more or less the same,
p50
aVno real innovation there.
p51
aa(lp52
VSo we started looking elsewhere.
p53
aVWhat we found was that flight simulators had been proven over and over again
p54
aVto be far more effective
p55
aVwhen used in combination with real, in-flight training to train the pilots.
p56
aVAnd so we thought to ourselves:
p57
aVWhy not just apply that to science?
p58
aVWhy not build a virtual laboratory simulator?
p59
aa(lp60
VWell, we did it.
p61
aVWe basically set out to create
p62
aVa fully simulated, one-to-one, virtual reality laboratory simulator,
p63
aVwhere the students could perform experiments
p64
aVwith mathematical equations
p65
aVthat would simulate what would happen in a real-world lab.
p66
aVBut not just simple simulations \u2014
p67
aVwe would also create advanced simulations
p68
aVwith top universities like MIT,
p69
aVto bring out cutting-edge cancer research to these students.
p70
aVAnd suddenly, the universities could save millions of dollars
p71
aVby letting the students perform virtual experiments
p72
aVbefore they go into the real laboratory.
p73
aVAnd not only that; now, they could also understand \u2014
p74
aVeven on a molecular level inside the machine \u2014
p75
aVwhat is happening to the machines.
p76
aVAnd then they could suddenly perform
p77
aVdangerous experiments in the labs as well.
p78
aVFor instance also here,
p79
aVlearning about salmonella bacteria, which is an important topic
p80
aVthat many schools cannot teach for good safety reasons.
p81
aVAnd we, of course, quiz the students
p82
aVand then give the teachers a full dashboard,
p83
aVso they fully understand where the students are at.
p84
aa(lp85
VBut we didn't stop there,
p86
aVbecause we had seen just how important meaning is
p87
aVfor the students' engagement in the class.
p88
aVSo we brought in game designers
p89
aVto create fun and engaging stories.
p90
aVFor instance, here in this case,
p91
aVwhere the students have to solve a mysterious CSI murder case
p92
aVusing their core science skills.
p93
aa(lp94
VAnd the feedback we got when we launched all of this
p95
aVwas quite overwhelmingly positive.
p96
aVHere we have 300 students,
p97
aVall passionately solving CSI murder cases
p98
aVwhile learning core science skills.
p99
aVAnd what I love the most about this
p100
aVis really when the students come up to me sometimes afterwards,
p101
aVall surprised and a little confused,
p102
aVand say, "I just spent two hours in this virtual lab,
p103
aVand ... and I didn't check Facebook."
p104
aa(lp105
V(Laughter)
p106
aa(lp107
VThat's how engaging and immersive this really is for the students.
p108
aa(lp109
VAnd so, to investigate whether this really worked,
p110
aVa learning psychologist did a study with 160 students \u2014
p111
aVthat was from Stanford University and Technical University of Denmark.
p112
aVAnd what they did is split the students into two groups.
p113
aVOne group would only use the virtual laboratory simulations,
p114
aVthe other group would only use traditional teaching methods,
p115
aVand they had the same amount of time.
p116
aVThen, interestingly,
p117
aVthey gave the students a test before and after the experiment,
p118
aVso they could clearly measure the learning impact of the students.
p119
aVAnd what they found
p120
aVwas a surprisingly high 76 percent increase in the learning effectiveness
p121
aVwhen using virtual laboratories over traditional teaching methods.
p122
aa(lp123
VBut even more interestingly,
p124
aVthe second part of this study investigated
p125
aVwhat the teacher's impact was on the learning.
p126
aVAnd what they found
p127
aVwas that when you combined the virtual laboratories
p128
aVwith teacher-led coaching and mentoring,
p129
aVthen we saw a total 101 percent increase in the learning effectiveness,
p130
aVwhich effectively doubles the science teacher's impact
p131
aVwith the same amount of time spent.
p132
aVSo a couple of months back,
p133
aVwe started asking ourselves \u2014
p134
aVwe have a wonderful team now of learning psychologists
p135
aVand teachers and scientists and game developers \u2014
p136
aVand we started asking ourselves:
p137
aVHow can we keep ourselves to our promise
p138
aVof constantly reimagining education?
p139
aa(lp140
VAnd today, I am really excited to be presenting what we came up with
p141
aVand have been working incredibly hard to create.
p142
aVI will explain briefly what this is.
p143
aVBasically, I take my mobile phone \u2014
p144
aVmost students already have these, smartphones \u2014
p145
aVand I plug it into this virtual-reality headset, a low-cost headset.
p146
aVAnd now what I can effectively do is,
p147
aVI can literally step into this virtual world.
p148
aVWe'll have some of you in the audience also get to try this,
p149
aVbecause it is really something that you have to try
p150
aVto fully feel how immersive it really is.
p151
aVIt literally feels like I just stepped inside this virtual lab.
p152
aVDo you see me up on the screen?
p153
aa(lp154
VAudience: Yes.
p155
aa(lp156
VMichael Bodekaer: Great! Awesome.
p157
aa(lp158
VSo basically, I have just turned my mobile phone
p159
aVinto a fully simulated, million-dollar Ivy League laboratory
p160
aVwith all this amazing equipment that I can interact with.
p161
aVI can, for instance, pick up the pipette and do experiments with it.
p162
aVI have my E-Ggel, my PCR and \u2014 oh, look there,
p163
aVI have my next-generation sequencing machine,
p164
aVand there I even have my electron microscope.
p165
aVI mean, who's carrying around an electron microscope in their pocket?
p166
aVAnd here I have my machine,
p167
aVI can do different experiments on the machine.
p168
aVAnd over here I have the door,
p169
aVI can go into other experiments,
p170
aVI can perform in the laboratories.
p171
aVAnd here, I have my learning tablet.
p172
aVThis is an intelligent tablet
p173
aVthat allows me to read about relevant theory.
p174
aVAs you can see, I can interact with it.
p175
aVI can watch videos and see content that is relevant
p176
aVto the experiment that I'm performing right now.
p177
aVThen over here, I have Marie.
p178
aVShe is my teacher \u2014 my lab assistant \u2014
p179
aVand what she does is guides me through this whole laboratory.
p180
aVAnd very soon,
p181
aVthe teachers will be able to literally teleport themselves
p182
aVinto this virtual world that I'm in right now
p183
aVand help me, guide me, through this whole experiment.
p184
aa(lp185
VAnd now before I finalize this,
p186
aVI want to show you an even cooler thing, I think \u2014
p187
aVsomething you cannot even do in real laboratories.
p188
aVThis is a PCR machine.
p189
aVI'm now going to start this experiment.
p190
aVAnd what I just did is literally shrunk myself a million times
p191
aVinto the size of a molecule \u2014
p192
aVand it really feels like it, you have to try this.
p193
aVSo now it feels like I'm standing inside the machine
p194
aVand I'm seeing all the DNA, and I see the molecules.
p195
aVI see the polymerase and the enzymes and so forth.
p196
aVAnd I can see how in this case,
p197
aVDNA is being replicated millions of times,
p198
aVjust like it's happening inside your body right now.
p199
aVAnd I can really feel and understand how all of this works.
p200
aa(lp201
VNow, I hope that gives you a little bit of a sense
p202
aVof the possibilities in these new teaching methods.
p203
aVAnd I want to also emphasize
p204
aVthat everything you just saw also works on iPads and laptops
p205
aVwithout the headsets.
p206
aVI say that for a very important reason.
p207
aVIn order for us to really empower and inspire
p208
aVthe next generation of scientists,
p209
aVwe really need teachers to drive the adoption
p210
aVof new technologies in the classroom.
p211
aVAnd so in many ways,
p212
aVI believe that the next big, quantum leap in science education
p213
aVlies no longer with the technology,
p214
aVbut rather with the teachers' decision
p215
aVto push forward and adopt these technologies
p216
aVinside the classrooms.
p217
aVAnd so it is our hope that more universities and schools and teachers
p218
aVwill collaborate with technology companies
p219
aVto realize this full potential.
p220
aa(lp221
VAnd so,
p222
aVlastly, I'd like to leave you with a little story
p223
aVthat really inspires me.
p224
aVAnd that is the story of Jack Andraka.
p225
aVSome of you might already know him.
p226
aVJack invented a new, groundbreaking low-cost test for pancreatic cancer
p227
aVat the age 15.
p228
aVAnd when Jack shares his story of how he did this huge breakthrough,
p229
aVhe also explains that one thing almost prevented him
p230
aVfrom making this breakthrough.
p231
aVAnd that was that he did not have access to real laboratories,
p232
aVbecause he was too inexperienced
p233
aVto be allowed in.
p234
aa(lp235
VNow, imagine if we could bring
p236
aVIvy League, million-dollar virtual laboratories
p237
aVout to all these students just like Jack,
p238
aVall over the world,
p239
aVand give them the latest, greatest, most fancy machines you can imagine
p240
aVthat would quite literally make any scientist in here
p241
aVjump up and down out of pure excitement.
p242
aVAnd then imagine how that would empower and inspire
p243
aVa whole new generation of young and bright scientists,
p244
aVready to innovate and change the world.
p245
aa(lp246
VThank you very much.
