VI wanted to just start by asking everyone a question:
p4
aVHow many of you are completely comfortable
p5
aVwith calling yourselves a leader?
p6
aVI've asked that question all across the country,
p7
aVand everywhere I ask it, no matter where,
p8
aVthere's a huge portion of the audience that won't put up their hand.
p9
aVAnd I've come to realize that we have made leadership
p10
aVinto something bigger than us; something beyond us.
p11
aVWe've made it about changing the world.
p12
aVWe've taken this title of "leader"
p13
aVand treat it as something that one day we're going to deserve.
p14
aVBut to give it to ourselves right now
p15
aVmeans a level of arrogance or cockiness that we're not comfortable with.
p16
aVAnd I worry sometimes that we spend so much time
p17
aVcelebrating amazing things that hardly anybody can do,
p18
aVthat we've convinced ourselves those are the only things worth celebrating.
p19
aVWe start to devalue the things we can do every day,
p20
aVWe take moments where we truly are a leader
p21
aVand we don't let ourselves take credit for it, or feel good about it.
p22
aVI've been lucky enough over the last 10 years
p23
aVto work with amazing people who've helped me redefine leadership
p24
aVin a way that I think has made me happier.
p25
aVWith my short time today,
p26
aVI want to share with you the one story that is probably most responsible
p27
aVfor that redefinition.
p28
aa(lp29
VI went to a little school
p30
aVcalled Mount Allison University in Sackville, New Brunswick.
p31
aVAnd on my last day there, a girl came up to me and said,
p32
aV"I remember the first time I met you."
p33
aVAnd she told me a story that had happened four years earlier.
p34
aVShe said, "On the day before I started university,
p35
aVI was in the hotel room with my mom and dad,
p36
aVand I was so scared and so convinced that I couldn't do this,
p37
aVthat I wasn't ready for university, that I just burst into tears.
p38
aVMy mom and dad were amazing.
p39
aVThey were like, "We know you're scared, but let's just go tomorrow,
p40
aVgo to the first day, and if at any point you feel as if you can't do this,
p41
aVthat's fine; tell us, and we'll take you home.
p42
aVWe love you no matter what.'"
p43
aa(lp44
VShe says, "So I went the next day.
p45
aVI was in line for registration,
p46
aVand I looked around and just knew I couldn't do it; I wasn't ready.
p47
aVI knew I had to quit.
p48
aVI made that decision and as soon as I made it,
p49
aVan incredible feeling of peace came over me.
p50
aVI turned to my mom and dad to tell them we needed to go home,
p51
aVand at that moment, you came out of the student union building
p52
aVwearing the stupidest hat I've ever seen in my life."
p53
aa(lp54
V(Laughter)
p55
aa(lp56
V"It was awesome.
p57
aVAnd you had a big sign promoting Shinerama," \u2014
p58
aVwhich is Students Fighting Cystic Fibrosis,
p59
aVa charity I've worked with for years \u2014
p60
aV"And you had a bucketful of lollipops.
p61
aVYou were handing the lollipops out to people in line,
p62
aVand talking about Shinerama.
p63
aVAll of the sudden, you got to me, and you just stopped.
p64
aVAnd you stared. It was creepy."
p65
aa(lp66
V(Laughter)
p67
aa(lp68
VThis girl knows what I'm talking about.
p69
aa(lp70
V(Laughter)
p71
aa(lp72
V"Then you looked at the guy next to me, smiled, reached into your bucket,
p73
aVpulled out a lollipop, held it out to him and said,
p74
aV'You need to give a lollipop to the beautiful woman next to you.'"
p75
aVShe said, "I've never seen anyone get more embarrassed faster in my life.
p76
aVHe turned beet red, he wouldn't even look at me.
p77
aVHe just kind of held the lollipop out like this."
p78
aa(lp79
V(Laughter)
p80
aa(lp81
V"I felt so bad for this dude that I took the lollipop.
p82
aVAs soon as I did, you got this incredibly severe look on your face,
p83
aVlooked at my mom and dad and said, 'Look at that! Look at that!
p84
aVFirst day away from home,
p85
aVand already she's taking candy from a stranger?'"
p86
aa(lp87
V(Laughter)
p88
aa(lp89
VShe said, "Everybody lost it.
p90
aVTwenty feet in every direction, everyone started to howl.
p91
aVI know this is cheesy, and I don't know why I'm telling you this,
p92
aVbut in that moment when everyone was laughing, I knew I shouldn't quit.
p93
aVI knew I was where I was supposed to be; I knew I was home.
p94
aVAnd I haven't spoken to you once in the four years since that day.
p95
aVBut I heard that you were leaving, and I had to come and tell you
p96
aVyou've been an incredibly important person in my life.
p97
aVI'm going to miss you. Good luck."
p98
aa(lp99
VAnd she walks away, and I'm flattened.
p100
aVShe gets six feet away, turns around, smiles and goes,
p101
aV"You should probably know this, too:
p102
aVI'm still dating that guy, four years later."
p103
aa(lp104
V(Laughter)
p105
aa(lp106
VA year and a half after I moved to Toronto,
p107
aVI got an invitation to their wedding.
p108
aa(lp109
V(Laughter)
p110
aa(lp111
VHere's the kicker: I don't remember that.
p112
aVI have no recollection of that moment.
p113
aVI've searched my memory banks,
p114
aVbecause that is funny and I should remember doing it and I don't.
p115
aVThat was such an eye-opening, transformative moment for me,
p116
aVto think that maybe the biggest impact I'd ever had on anyone's life,
p117
aVa moment that had a woman walk up to a stranger four years later and say,
p118
aV"You've been an important person in my life,"
p119
aVwas a moment that I didn't even remember.
p120
aa(lp121
VHow many of you guys have a lollipop moment,
p122
aVa moment where someone said or did something
p123
aVthat you feel fundamentally made your life better?
p124
aVAll right. How many of you have told that person they did it?
p125
aVSee, why not?
p126
aVWe celebrate birthdays,
p127
aVwhere all you have to do is not die for 365 days \u2014
p128
aa(lp129
V(Laughter)
p130
aa(lp131
VYet we let people who have made our lives better
p132
aVwalk around without knowing it.
p133
aVEvery single one of you has been the catalyst
p134
aVfor a lollipop moment.
p135
aVYou've made someone's life better by something you said or did.
p136
aVIf you think you haven't,
p137
aVthink of all the hands that didn't go up when I asked.
p138
aVYou're just one of the people who hasn't been told.
p139
aa(lp140
VIt's scary to think of ourselves as that powerful,
p141
aVfrightening to think we can matter that much to other people.
p142
aVAs long as we make leadership something bigger than us,
p143
aVas long as we keep leadership beyond us
p144
aVand make it about changing the world,
p145
aVwe give ourselves an excuse not to expect it every day,
p146
aVfrom ourselves and from each other.
p147
aa(lp148
VMarianne Williamson said, "Our greatest fear is not that we are inadequate.
p149
aV[It] is that we are powerful beyond measure.
p150
aVIt is our light and not our darkness that frightens us."
p151
aVMy call to action today is that we need to get over our fear
p152
aVof how extraordinarily powerful we can be in each other's lives.
p153
aVWe need to get over it so we can move beyond it,
p154
aVand our little brothers and sisters and one day our kids \u2014
p155
aVor our kids right now \u2014 can watch and start to value
p156
aVthe impact we can have on each other's lives,
p157
aVmore than money and power and titles and influence.
p158
aVWe need to redefine leadership as being about lollipop moments \u2014
p159
aVhow many of them we create, how many we acknowledge,
p160
aVhow many of them we pay forward and how many we say thank you for.
p161
aVBecause we've made leadership about changing the world,
p162
aVand there is no world.
p163
aVThere's only six billion understandings of it.
p164
aa(lp165
VAnd if you change one person's understanding of it,
p166
aVunderstanding of what they're capable of,
p167
aVunderstanding of how much people care about them,
p168
aVunderstanding of how powerful an agent for change
p169
aVthey can be in this world,
p170
aVyou've changed the whole thing.
p171
aa(lp172
VAnd if we can understand leadership like that,
p173
aVI think if we can redefine leadership like that,
p174
aVI think we can change everything.
p175
aVAnd it's a simple idea, but I don't think it's a small one.
p176
aVI want to thank you so much for letting me share it with you today.
