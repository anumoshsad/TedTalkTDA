VThis is me building a prototype
p4
aVfor six hours straight.
p5
aVThis is slave labor to my own project.
p6
aVThis is what the DIY and maker movements really look like.
p7
aVAnd this is an analogy for today's construction and manufacturing world
p8
aVwith brute-force assembly techniques.
p9
aVAnd this is exactly why I started studying
p10
aVhow to program physical materials to build themselves.
p11
aa(lp12
VBut there is another world.
p13
aVToday at the micro- and nanoscales,
p14
aVthere's an unprecedented revolution happening.
p15
aVAnd this is the ability to program physical and biological materials
p16
aVto change shape, change properties
p17
aVand even compute outside of silicon-based matter.
p18
aVThere's even a software called cadnano
p19
aVthat allows us to design three-dimensional shapes
p20
aVlike nano robots or drug delivery systems
p21
aVand use DNA to self-assemble those functional structures.
p22
aa(lp23
VBut if we look at the human scale,
p24
aVthere's massive problems that aren't being addressed
p25
aVby those nanoscale technologies.
p26
aVIf we look at construction and manufacturing,
p27
aVthere's major inefficiencies, energy consumption
p28
aVand excessive labor techniques.
p29
aVIn infrastructure, let's just take one example.
p30
aVTake piping.
p31
aVIn water pipes, we have fixed-capacity water pipes
p32
aVthat have fixed flow rates, except for expensive pumps and valves.
p33
aVWe bury them in the ground.
p34
aVIf anything changes \u2014 if the environment changes,
p35
aVthe ground moves, or demand changes \u2014
p36
aVwe have to start from scratch and take them out and replace them.
p37
aa(lp38
VSo I'd like to propose that we can combine those two worlds,
p39
aVthat we can combine the world of the nanoscale programmable adaptive materials
p40
aVand the built environment.
p41
aVAnd I don't mean automated machines.
p42
aVI don't just mean smart machines that replace humans.
p43
aVBut I mean programmable materials that build themselves.
p44
aVAnd that's called self-assembly,
p45
aVwhich is a process by which disordered parts build an ordered structure
p46
aVthrough only local interaction.
p47
aa(lp48
VSo what do we need if we want to do this at the human scale?
p49
aVWe need a few simple ingredients.
p50
aVThe first ingredient is materials and geometry,
p51
aVand that needs to be tightly coupled with the energy source.
p52
aVAnd you can use passive energy \u2014
p53
aVso heat, shaking, pneumatics, gravity, magnetics.
p54
aVAnd then you need smartly designed interactions.
p55
aVAnd those interactions allow for error correction,
p56
aVand they allow the shapes to go from one state to another state.
p57
aa(lp58
VSo now I'm going to show you a number of projects that we've built,
p59
aVfrom one-dimensional, two-dimensional, three-dimensional
p60
aVand even four-dimensional systems.
p61
aVSo in one-dimensional systems \u2014
p62
aVthis is a project called the self-folding proteins.
p63
aVAnd the idea is that you take the three-dimensional structure of a protein \u2014
p64
aVin this case it's the crambin protein \u2014
p65
aVyou take the backbone \u2014 so no cross-linking, no environmental interactions \u2014
p66
aVand you break that down into a series of components.
p67
aVAnd then we embed elastic.
p68
aVAnd when I throw this up into the air and catch it,
p69
aVit has the full three-dimensional structure of the protein, all of the intricacies.
p70
aVAnd this gives us a tangible model
p71
aVof the three-dimensional protein and how it folds
p72
aVand all of the intricacies of the geometry.
p73
aVSo we can study this as a physical, intuitive model.
p74
aVAnd we're also translating that into two-dimensional systems \u2014
p75
aVso flat sheets that can self-fold into three-dimensional structures.
p76
aa(lp77
VIn three dimensions, we did a project last year at TEDGlobal
p78
aVwith Autodesk and Arthur Olson
p79
aVwhere we looked at autonomous parts \u2014
p80
aVso individual parts not pre-connected that can come together on their own.
p81
aVAnd we built 500 of these glass beakers.
p82
aVThey had different molecular structures inside
p83
aVand different colors that could be mixed and matched.
p84
aVAnd we gave them away to all the TEDsters.
p85
aVAnd so these became intuitive models
p86
aVto understand how molecular self-assembly works at the human scale.
p87
aVThis is the polio virus.
p88
aVYou shake it hard and it breaks apart.
p89
aVAnd then you shake it randomly
p90
aVand it starts to error correct and built the structure on its own.
p91
aVAnd this is demonstrating that through random energy,
p92
aVwe can build non-random shapes.
p93
aa(lp94
VWe even demonstrated that we can do this at a much larger scale.
p95
aVLast year at TED Long Beach,
p96
aVwe built an installation that builds installations.
p97
aVThe idea was, could we self-assemble furniture-scale objects?
p98
aVSo we built a large rotating chamber,
p99
aVand people would come up and spin the chamber faster or slower,
p100
aVadding energy to the system
p101
aVand getting an intuitive understanding of how self-assembly works
p102
aVand how we could use this
p103
aVas a macroscale construction or manufacturing technique for products.
p104
aa(lp105
VSo remember, I said 4D.
p106
aVSo today for the first time, we're unveiling a new project,
p107
aVwhich is a collaboration with Stratasys,
p108
aVand it's called 4D printing.
p109
aVThe idea behind 4D printing
p110
aVis that you take multi-material 3D printing \u2014
p111
aVso you can deposit multiple materials \u2014
p112
aVand you add a new capability,
p113
aVwhich is transformation,
p114
aVthat right off the bed,
p115
aVthe parts can transform from one shape to another shape directly on their own.
p116
aVAnd this is like robotics without wires or motors.
p117
aVSo you completely print this part,
p118
aVand it can transform into something else.
p119
aa(lp120
VWe also worked with Autodesk on a software they're developing called Project Cyborg.
p121
aVAnd this allows us to simulate this self-assembly behavior
p122
aVand try to optimize which parts are folding when.
p123
aVBut most importantly, we can use this same software
p124
aVfor the design of nanoscale self-assembly systems
p125
aVand human scale self-assembly systems.
p126
aVThese are parts being printed with multi-material properties.
p127
aVHere's the first demonstration.
p128
aVA single strand dipped in water
p129
aVthat completely self-folds on its own
p130
aVinto the letters M I T.
p131
aVI'm biased.
p132
aVThis is another part, single strand, dipped in a bigger tank
p133
aVthat self-folds into a cube, a three-dimensional structure, on its own.
p134
aVSo no human interaction.
p135
aVAnd we think this is the first time
p136
aVthat a program and transformation
p137
aVhas been embedded directly into the materials themselves.
p138
aVAnd it also might just be the manufacturing technique
p139
aVthat allows us to produce more adaptive infrastructure in the future.
p140
aa(lp141
VSo I know you're probably thinking,
p142
aVokay, that's cool, but how do we use any of this stuff for the built environment?
p143
aVSo I've started a lab at MIT,
p144
aVand it's called the Self-Assembly Lab.
p145
aVAnd we're dedicated to trying to develop programmable materials
p146
aVfor the built environment.
p147
aVAnd we think there's a few key sectors
p148
aVthat have fairly near-term applications.
p149
aVOne of those is in extreme environments.
p150
aVThese are scenarios where it's difficult to build,
p151
aVour current construction techniques don't work,
p152
aVit's too large, it's too dangerous, it's expensive, too many parts.
p153
aVAnd space is a great example of that.
p154
aVWe're trying to design new scenarios for space
p155
aVthat have fully reconfigurable and self-assembly structures
p156
aVthat can go from highly functional systems from one to another.
p157
aa(lp158
VLet's go back to infrastructure.
p159
aVIn infrastructure, we're working with a company out of Boston called Geosyntec.
p160
aVAnd we're developing a new paradigm for piping.
p161
aVImagine if water pipes could expand or contract
p162
aVto change capacity or change flow rate,
p163
aVor maybe even undulate like peristaltics to move the water themselves.
p164
aVSo this isn't expensive pumps or valves.
p165
aVThis is a completely programmable and adaptive pipe on its own.
p166
aa(lp167
VSo I want to remind you today
p168
aVof the harsh realities of assembly in our world.
p169
aVThese are complex things built with complex parts
p170
aVthat come together in complex ways.
p171
aVSo I would like to invite you from whatever industry you're from
p172
aVto join us in reinventing and reimagining the world,
p173
aVhow things come together from the nanoscale to the human scale,
p174
aVso that we can go from a world like this
p175
aVto a world that's more like this.
