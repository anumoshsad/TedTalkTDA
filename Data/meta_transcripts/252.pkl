VOne way to change our genes is to make new ones,
p4
aVas Craig Venter has so elegantly shown.
p5
aVAnother is to change our lifestyles.
p6
aVAnd what we're learning is how powerful and dynamic these changes can be,
p7
aVthat you don't have to wait very long to see the benefits.
p8
aVWhen you eat healthier, manage stress, exercise and love more,
p9
aVyour brain actually gets more blood flow and more oxygen.
p10
aVBut more than that, your brain gets measurably bigger.
p11
aVThings that were thought impossible just a few years ago
p12
aVcan actually be measured now.
p13
aVThis was figured out by Robin Williams
p14
aVa few years before the rest of us.
p15
aa(lp16
VNow, there's some things that you can do
p17
aVto make your brain grow new brain cells.
p18
aVSome of my favorite things, like chocolate and tea, blueberries,
p19
aValcohol in moderation, stress management
p20
aVand cannabinoids found in marijuana.
p21
aVI'm just the messenger.
p22
aV(Laughter)
p23
aVWhat were we just talking about?
p24
aV(Laughter)
p25
aVAnd other things that can make it worse,
p26
aVthat can cause you to lose brain cells.
p27
aVThe usual suspects, like saturated fat and sugar,
p28
aVnicotine, opiates, cocaine, too much alcohol and chronic stress.
p29
aa(lp30
VYour skin gets more blood flow when you change your lifestyle,
p31
aVso you age less quickly. Your skin doesn't wrinkle as much.
p32
aVYour heart gets more blood flow.
p33
aVWe've shown that you can actually reverse heart disease.
p34
aVThat these clogged arteries that you see on the upper left,
p35
aVafter only a year become measurably less clogged.
p36
aVAnd the cardiac PET scan shown on the lower left,
p37
aVthe blue means no blood flow.
p38
aVA year later \u2014 orange and white is maximum blood flow.
p39
aVWe've shown you may be able to stop and reverse the progression
p40
aVof early prostate cancer and, by extension, breast cancer,
p41
aVsimply by making these changes.
p42
aVWe've found that tumor growth in vitro was inhibited
p43
aV70 percent in the group that made these changes,
p44
aVwhereas only nine percent in the comparison group.
p45
aa(lp46
VThese differences were highly significant.
p47
aVEven your sexual organs get more blood flow,
p48
aVso you increase sexual potency.
p49
aVOne of the most effective anti-smoking ads was done
p50
aVby the Department of Health Services,
p51
aVshowing that nicotine, which constricts your arteries,
p52
aVcan cause a heart attack or a stroke,
p53
aVbut it also causes impotence.
p54
aVHalf of guys who smoke are impotent.
p55
aVHow sexy is that?
p56
aa(lp57
VNow we're also about to publish a study \u2014
p58
aVthe first study showing you can change gene expression in men with prostate cancer.
p59
aVThis is what's called a heat map \u2014
p60
aVand the different colors \u2014 and along the side, on the right, are different genes.
p61
aVAnd we found that over 500 genes were favorably changed \u2014
p62
aVin effect, turning on the good genes, the disease-preventing genes,
p63
aVturning off the disease-promoting genes.
p64
aa(lp65
VAnd so these findings I think are really very powerful,
p66
aVgiving many people new hope and new choices.
p67
aVAnd companies like Navigenics and DNA Direct and 23andMe,
p68
aVthat are giving you your genetic profiles,
p69
aVare giving some people a sense of, "Gosh, well, what can I do about it?"
p70
aVWell, our genes are not our fate, and if we make these changes \u2014
p71
aVthey're a predisposition \u2014 but if we make bigger changes
p72
aVthan we might have made otherwise,
p73
aVwe can actually change how our genes are expressed.
p74
aVThank you.
