VI'm a gamer, so I like to have goals.
p4
aVI like special missions and secret objectives.
p5
aVSo here's my special mission for this talk:
p6
aVI'm going to try to increase the life span of every single person in this room
p7
aVby seven and a half minutes.
p8
aVLiterally, you will live seven and a half minutes longer
p9
aVthan you would have otherwise,
p10
aVjust because you watched this talk.
p11
aa(lp12
VSome of you are looking a little bit skeptical.
p13
aVThat's okay, because check it out \u2014
p14
aVI have math to prove that it is possible.
p15
aVIt won't make much sense now.
p16
aVI'll explain it all later,
p17
aVjust pay attention to the number at the bottom:
p18
aV+7.68245837 minutes.
p19
aVThat will be my gift to you if I'm successful in my mission.
p20
aa(lp21
VNow, you have a secret mission too.
p22
aVYour mission is to figure out how you want to spend
p23
aVyour extra seven and a half minutes.
p24
aVAnd I think you should do something unusual with them,
p25
aVbecause these are bonus minutes.
p26
aVYou weren't going to have them anyway.
p27
aa(lp28
VNow, because I'm a game designer, you might be thinking to yourself,
p29
aVI know what she wants us to do with those minutes,
p30
aVshe wants us to spend them playing games.
p31
aVNow this is a totally reasonable assumption,
p32
aVgiven that I have made quite a habit of encouraging people
p33
aVto spend more time playing games.
p34
aVFor example, in my first TED Talk,
p35
aVI did propose that we should spend 21 billion hours a week,
p36
aVas a planet, playing video games.
p37
aa(lp38
VNow, 21 billion hours, it's a lot of time.
p39
aVIt's so much time, in fact, that the number one unsolicited comment
p40
aVthat I have heard from people all over the world
p41
aVsince I gave that talk, is this:
p42
aVJane, games are great and all, but on your deathbed,
p43
aVare you really going to wish you spent more time playing Angry Birds?
p44
aa(lp45
V(Laughter)
p46
aa(lp47
VThis idea is so pervasive \u2014
p48
aVthat games are a waste of time that we will come to regret \u2014
p49
aVthat I hear it literally everywhere I go.
p50
aVFor example, true story:
p51
aVJust a few weeks ago,
p52
aVthis cab driver, upon finding out that a friend and I were in town
p53
aVfor a game developers' conference,
p54
aVturned around and said \u2014 and I quote \u2014
p55
aV"I hate games. Waste of life.
p56
aVImagine getting to the end of your life and regretting all that time."
p57
aa(lp58
VNow, I want to take this problem seriously.
p59
aVI want games to be a force for good in the world.
p60
aVI don't want gamers to regret the time they spent playing,
p61
aVtime that I encouraged them to spend.
p62
aVSo I have been thinking about this question a lot lately.
p63
aVWhen we're on our deathbeds,
p64
aVwill we regret the time we spent playing games?
p65
aa(lp66
VNow, this may surprise you, but it turns out
p67
aVthere is actually some scientific research on this question.
p68
aVIt's true.
p69
aVHospice workers,
p70
aVthe people who take care of us at the end of our lives,
p71
aVrecently issued a report on the most frequently expressed regrets
p72
aVthat people say when they are literally on their deathbeds.
p73
aVAnd that's what I want to share with you today \u2014
p74
aVthe top five regrets of the dying.
p75
aa(lp76
VNumber one:
p77
aVI wish I hadn't worked so hard.
p78
aVNumber two:
p79
aVI wish I had stayed in touch with my friends.
p80
aVNumber three:
p81
aVI wish I had let myself be happier.
p82
aVNumber four:
p83
aVI wish I'd had the courage to express my true self.
p84
aVAnd number five:
p85
aVI wish I'd lived a life true to my dreams,
p86
aVinstead of what others expected of me.
p87
aa(lp88
VNow, as far as I know, no one ever told one of the hospice workers,
p89
aV"I wish I'd spent more time playing video games,"
p90
aVbut when I hear these top five regrets of the dying,
p91
aVI can't help but hear five deep human cravings
p92
aVthat games actually help us fulfill.
p93
aa(lp94
VFor example, I wish I hadn't worked so hard.
p95
aVFor many people, this means, I wish I'd spent more time
p96
aVwith my family, with my kids when they were growing up.
p97
aVWell, we know that playing games together has tremendous family benefits.
p98
aVA recent study from Brigham Young University School of Family Life
p99
aVreported that parents who spend more time playing video games with their kids
p100
aVhave much stronger real-life relationships with them.
p101
aa(lp102
V"I wish I'd stayed in touch with my friends."
p103
aVHundreds of millions of people
p104
aVuse social games like FarmVille or Words With Friends
p105
aVto stay in daily contact with real-life friends and family.
p106
aVA recent study from the University of Michigan
p107
aVshowed that these games are incredibly powerful relationship-management tools.
p108
aVThey help us stay connected with people in our social network
p109
aVthat we would otherwise grow distant from,
p110
aVif we weren't playing games together.
p111
aa(lp112
V"I wish I'd let myself be happier."
p113
aVWell, here I can't help but think of the groundbreaking clinical trials
p114
aVrecently conducted at East Carolina University
p115
aVthat showed that online games can outperform
p116
aVpharmaceuticals for treating clinical anxiety and depression.
p117
aVJust 30 minutes of online game play a day
p118
aVwas enough to create dramatic boosts in mood
p119
aVand long-term increases in happiness.
p120
aa(lp121
V"I wish I'd had the courage to express my true self."
p122
aVWell, avatars are a way to express our true selves,
p123
aVour most heroic, idealized version of who we might become.
p124
aVYou can see that in this alter ego portrait by Robbie Cooper
p125
aVof a gamer with his avatar.
p126
aVAnd Stanford University has been doing research for five years now
p127
aVto document how playing a game with an idealized avatar
p128
aVchanges how we think and act in real life,
p129
aVmaking us more courageous, more ambitious,
p130
aVmore committed to our goals.
p131
aa(lp132
V"I wish I'd led a life true to my dreams,
p133
aVand not what others expected of me."
p134
aVAre games doing this yet?
p135
aVI'm not sure, so I've left a Super Mario question mark.
p136
aVWe're going to come back to this one.
p137
aa(lp138
VBut in the meantime, perhaps you're wondering,
p139
aVwho is this game designer to be talking to us
p140
aVabout deathbed regrets?
p141
aVAnd it's true, I've never worked in a hospice,
p142
aVI've never been on my deathbed.
p143
aVBut recently I did spend three months in bed, wanting to die.
p144
aVReally wanting to die.
p145
aa(lp146
VNow let me tell you that story.
p147
aVIt started two years ago, when I hit my head and got a concussion.
p148
aVThe concussion didn't heal properly,
p149
aVand after 30 days, I was left with symptoms like nonstop headaches,
p150
aVnausea, vertigo, memory loss, mental fog.
p151
aVMy doctor told me that in order to heal my brain,
p152
aVI had to rest it.
p153
aVSo I had to avoid everything that triggered my symptoms.
p154
aVFor me that meant no reading, no writing, no video games,
p155
aVno work or email, no running, no alcohol, no caffeine.
p156
aVIn other words \u2014 and I think you see where this is going \u2014
p157
aVno reason to live.
p158
aa(lp159
V(Laughter)
p160
aa(lp161
VOf course it's meant to be funny,
p162
aVbut in all seriousness, suicidal ideation is quite common
p163
aVwith traumatic brain injuries.
p164
aVIt happens to one in three, and it happened to me.
p165
aVMy brain started telling me, "Jane, you want to die."
p166
aVIt said, "You're never going to get better."
p167
aVIt said, "The pain will never end."
p168
aa(lp169
VAnd these voices became so persistent and so persuasive
p170
aVthat I started to legitimately fear for my life,
p171
aVwhich is the time that I said to myself after 34 days \u2014
p172
aVand I will never forget this moment \u2014
p173
aVI said, "I am either going to kill myself
p174
aVor I'm going to turn this into a game."
p175
aa(lp176
VNow, why a game?
p177
aVI knew from researching the psychology of games for more than a decade
p178
aVthat when we play a game \u2014
p179
aVand this is in the scientific literature \u2014
p180
aVwe tackle tough challenges with more creativity,
p181
aVmore determination, more optimism,
p182
aVand we're more likely to reach out to others for help.
p183
aVI wanted to bring these gamer traits to my real-life challenge,
p184
aVso I created a role-playing recovery game
p185
aVcalled Jane the Concussion Slayer.
p186
aa(lp187
VNow this became my new secret identity,
p188
aVand the first thing I did as a slayer was call my twin sister \u2014
p189
aVI have an identical twin sister named Kelly \u2014
p190
aVand tell her, "I'm playing a game to heal my brain,
p191
aVand I want you to play with me."
p192
aVThis was an easier way to ask for help.
p193
aa(lp194
VShe became my first ally in the game,
p195
aVmy husband Kiyash joined next,
p196
aVand together we identified and battled the bad guys.
p197
aVNow this was anything that could trigger my symptoms
p198
aVand therefore slow down the healing process,
p199
aVthings like bright lights and crowded spaces.
p200
aVWe also collected and activated power-ups.
p201
aVThis was anything I could do on even my worst day
p202
aVto feel just a little bit good,
p203
aVjust a little bit productive.
p204
aVThings like cuddling my dog for 10 minutes,
p205
aVor getting out of bed and walking around the block just once.
p206
aa(lp207
VNow the game was that simple:
p208
aVAdopt a secret identity, recruit your allies,
p209
aVbattle the bad guys, activate the power-ups.
p210
aVBut even with a game so simple,
p211
aVwithin just a couple days of starting to play,
p212
aVthat fog of depression and anxiety went away.
p213
aVIt just vanished. It felt like a miracle.
p214
aVNow it wasn't a miracle cure for the headaches
p215
aVor the cognitive symptoms.
p216
aVThat lasted for more than a year,
p217
aVand it was the hardest year of my life by far.
p218
aVBut even when I still had the symptoms,
p219
aVeven while I was still in pain, I stopped suffering.
p220
aa(lp221
VNow what happened next with the game surprised me.
p222
aVI put up some blog posts and videos online,
p223
aVexplaining how to play.
p224
aVBut not everybody has a concussion, obviously,
p225
aVnot everyone wants to be "the slayer,"
p226
aVso I renamed the game SuperBetter.
p227
aa(lp228
VAnd soon, I started hearing from people all over the world
p229
aVwho were adopting their own secret identity,
p230
aVrecruiting their own allies, and they were getting "super better,"
p231
aVfacing challenges like cancer and chronic pain,
p232
aVdepression and Crohn's disease.
p233
aVEven people were playing it for terminal diagnoses like ALS.
p234
aVAnd I could tell from their messages and their videos
p235
aVthat the game was helping them in the same ways that it helped me.
p236
aVThey talked about feeling stronger and braver.
p237
aVThey talked about feeling better understood by their friends and family.
p238
aVAnd they even talked about feeling happier,
p239
aVeven though they were in pain,
p240
aVeven though they were tackling the toughest challenge of their lives.
p241
aa(lp242
VNow at the time, I'm thinking to myself, what is going on here?
p243
aVI mean, how could a game so trivial intervene so powerfully
p244
aVin such serious, and in some cases life-and-death, circumstances?
p245
aVI mean, if it hadn't worked for me,
p246
aVthere's no way I would have believed it was possible.
p247
aVWell, it turns out there's some science here, too.
p248
aVSome people get stronger and happier after a traumatic event.
p249
aVAnd that's what was happening to us.
p250
aa(lp251
VThe game was helping us experience
p252
aVwhat scientists call post-traumatic growth,
p253
aVwhich is not something we usually hear about.
p254
aVWe usually hear about post-traumatic stress disorder.
p255
aVBut scientists now know that a traumatic event
p256
aVdoesn't doom us to suffer indefinitely.
p257
aVInstead, we can use it as a springboard
p258
aVto unleash our best qualities and lead happier lives.
p259
aa(lp260
VHere are the top five things that people with post-traumatic growth say:
p261
aV"My priorities have changed."
p262
aV"I'm not afraid to do what makes me happy."
p263
aV"I feel closer to my friends and family."
p264
aV"I understand myself better. I know who I really am now."
p265
aV"I have a new sense of meaning and purpose in my life."
p266
aV"I'm better able to focus on my goals and dreams."
p267
aa(lp268
VNow, does this sound familiar?
p269
aVIt should, because the top five traits of post-traumatic growth
p270
aVare essentially the direct opposite of the top five regrets of the dying.
p271
aVNow this is interesting, right?
p272
aVIt seems that somehow, a traumatic event
p273
aVcan unlock our ability to lead a life with fewer regrets.
p274
aa(lp275
VBut how does it work?
p276
aVHow do you get from trauma to growth?
p277
aVOr better yet, is there a way to get all the benefits
p278
aVof post-traumatic growth without the trauma,
p279
aVwithout having to hit your head in the first place?
p280
aVThat would be good, right?
p281
aa(lp282
VI wanted to understand the phenomenon better,
p283
aVso I devoured the scientific literature, and here's what I learned.
p284
aVThere are four kinds of strength, or resilience,
p285
aVthat contribute to post-traumatic growth,
p286
aVand there are scientifically validated activities
p287
aVthat you can do every day to build up these four kinds of resilience,
p288
aVand you don't need a trauma to do it.
p289
aa(lp290
VI could tell you what these four types of strength are,
p291
aVbut I'd rather you experience them firsthand.
p292
aVI'd rather we all start building them up together right now.
p293
aVHere's what we're going to do.
p294
aVWe'll play a quick game together.
p295
aVThis is where you earn the seven and a half minutes
p296
aVof bonus life that I promised you earlier.
p297
aVAll you have to do is successfully complete
p298
aVthe first four SuperBetter quests.
p299
aVAnd I feel like you can do it. I have confidence in you.
p300
aa(lp301
VSo, everybody ready?
p302
aVThis is your first quest. Here we go.
p303
aVPick one: Stand up and take three steps,
p304
aVor make your hands into fists, raise them over your head
p305
aVas high as you can for five seconds, go!
p306
aVAll right, I like the people doing both.
p307
aVYou are overachievers. Very good.
p308
aa(lp309
V(Laughter)
p310
aa(lp311
VWell done, everyone.
p312
aVThat is worth +1 physical resilience,
p313
aVwhich means that your body can withstand more stress
p314
aVand heal itself faster.
p315
aVWe know from the research
p316
aVthat the number one thing you can do to boost your physical resilience
p317
aVis to not sit still.
p318
aVThat's all it takes.
p319
aVEvery single second that you are not sitting still,
p320
aVyou are actively improving the health of your heart,
p321
aVand your lungs and brains.
p322
aa(lp323
VEverybody ready for your next quest?
p324
aVI want you to snap your fingers exactly 50 times,
p325
aVor count backwards from 100 by seven, like this: 100, 93...
p326
aVGo!
p327
aa(lp328
V(Snapping)
p329
aa(lp330
VDon't give up.
p331
aa(lp332
V(Snapping)
p333
aa(lp334
VDon't let the people counting down from 100
p335
aVinterfere with your counting to 50.
p336
aa(lp337
V(Snapping)
p338
aa(lp339
V(Laughter)
p340
aa(lp341
VNice. Wow. That's the first time I've ever seen that.
p342
aVBonus physical resilience. Well done, everyone.
p343
aVNow that's worth +1 mental resilience,
p344
aVwhich means you have more mental focus, more discipline,
p345
aVdetermination and willpower.
p346
aVWe know from the scientific research
p347
aVthat willpower actually works like a muscle.
p348
aVIt gets stronger the more you exercise it.
p349
aVSo tackling a tiny challenge without giving up,
p350
aVeven one as absurd as snapping your fingers exactly 50 times
p351
aVor counting backwards from 100 by seven
p352
aVis actually a scientifically validated way to boost your willpower.
p353
aa(lp354
VSo good job. Quest number three.
p355
aVPick one: Because of the room, fate's really determined this for you,
p356
aVbut here are the two options.
p357
aVIf you're inside, find a window and look out of it.
p358
aVIf you're outside, find a window and look in.
p359
aVOr do a quick YouTube or Google image search
p360
aVfor "baby [your favorite animal.]"
p361
aa(lp362
VDo it on your phones, or just shout out some baby animals,
p363
aVand I'll put them on the screen.
p364
aVSo, what do we want to see?
p365
aVSloth, giraffe, elephant, snake. Okay, let's see what we got.
p366
aVBaby dolphin and baby llamas. Everybody look.
p367
aVGot that?
p368
aVOkay, one more. Baby elephant.
p369
aa(lp370
V(Audience) Oh!
p371
aa(lp372
VWe're clapping for that?
p373
aVThat's amazing.
p374
aa(lp375
V(Laughter)
p376
aa(lp377
VAll right, what we're just feeling there is plus-one emotional resilience,
p378
aVwhich means you have the ability to provoke powerful,
p379
aVpositive emotions like curiosity or love,
p380
aVwhich we feel looking at baby animals,
p381
aVwhen you need them most.
p382
aa(lp383
VHere's a secret from the scientific literature for you.
p384
aVIf you can manage to experience three positive emotions
p385
aVfor every one negative emotion
p386
aVover the course of an hour, a day, a week,
p387
aVyou dramatically improve your health
p388
aVand your ability to successfully tackle any problem you're facing.
p389
aVAnd this is called the three-to-one positive emotion ratio.
p390
aVIt's my favorite SuperBetter trick, so keep it up.
p391
aa(lp392
VAll right, pick one, last quest:
p393
aVShake someone's hand for six seconds,
p394
aVor send someone a quick thank you
p395
aVby text, email, Facebook or Twitter. Go!
p396
aa(lp397
V(Chatting)
p398
aa(lp399
VLooking good, looking good.
p400
aVNice, nice.
p401
aVKeep it up.
p402
aVI love it!
p403
aVAll right, everybody, that is +1 social resilience,
p404
aVwhich means you actually get more strength from your friends,
p405
aVyour neighbors, your family, your community.
p406
aVNow, a great way to boost social resilience is gratitude.
p407
aVTouch is even better.
p408
aa(lp409
VHere's one more secret for you:
p410
aVShaking someone's hand for six seconds
p411
aVdramatically raises the level of oxytocin in your bloodstream,
p412
aVnow that's the trust hormone.
p413
aVThat means that all of you who just shook hands
p414
aVare biochemically primed to like and want to help each other.
p415
aVThis will linger during the break,
p416
aVso take advantage of the networking opportunities.
p417
aa(lp418
V(Laughter)
p419
aa(lp420
VWell, you have successfully completed your four quests,
p421
aVlet's see if I've successfully completed my mission
p422
aVto give you seven and a half minutes of bonus life.
p423
aVNow I get to share one more little bit of science with you.
p424
aVIt turns out that people who regularly boost these four types of resilience \u2014
p425
aVphysical, mental, emotional and social \u2014
p426
aVlive 10 years longer than everyone else.
p427
aVSo this is true.
p428
aVIf you are regularly achieving the three-to-one positive emotion ratio,
p429
aVif you are never sitting still for more than an hour at a time,
p430
aVif you are reaching out to one person you care about every single day,
p431
aVif you are tackling tiny goals to boost your willpower,
p432
aVyou will live 10 years longer than everyone else,
p433
aVand here's where that math I showed you earlier comes in.
p434
aa(lp435
VSo, the average life expectancy in the U.S. and the U.K. is 78.1 years,
p436
aVbut we know from more than 1,000 peer-reviewed scientific studies
p437
aVthat you can add 10 years of life by boosting your four types of resilience.
p438
aVSo every single year that you are boosting your four types of resilience,
p439
aVyou're actually earning .128 more years of life
p440
aVor 46 more days of life, or 67,298 more minutes of life,
p441
aVwhich means every single day, you are earning 184 minutes of life,
p442
aVor every single hour that you are boosting your four types of resilience,
p443
aVlike we just did together, you are earning 7.68245837
p444
aVmore minutes of life.
p445
aa(lp446
VCongratulations, those seven and a half minutes are all yours.
p447
aVYou totally earned them.
p448
aa(lp449
VYeah!
p450
aa(lp451
V(Applause)
p452
aa(lp453
VAwesome.
p454
