VOn the path that American children  travel to adulthood,
p4
aVtwo institutions oversee the journey.
p5
aVThe first is the one we hear  a lot about: college.
p6
aVSome of you may remember the excitement that you felt
p7
aVwhen you first set off for college.
p8
aVSome of you may be in college right now
p9
aVand you're feeling this excitement at this very moment.
p10
aa(lp11
VCollege has some shortcomings.
p12
aVIt's expensive; it leaves young people in debt.
p13
aVBut all in all, it's a pretty good path.
p14
aVYoung people emerge from college with pride and with great friends
p15
aVand with a lot of knowledge  about the world.
p16
aVAnd perhaps most importantly,
p17
aVa better chance in the labor market than they had before they got there.
p18
aa(lp19
VToday I want to talk about the second institution
p20
aVoverseeing the journey from childhood to adulthood in the United States.
p21
aVAnd that institution is prison.
p22
aVYoung people on this journey are meeting with probation officers
p23
aVinstead of with teachers.
p24
aVThey're going to court dates instead of to class.
p25
aVTheir junior year abroad is instead a trip to a state correctional facility.
p26
aVAnd they're emerging from their 20s
p27
aVnot with degrees in business and English,
p28
aVbut with criminal records.
p29
aa(lp30
VThis institution is also costing us a lot,
p31
aVabout 40,000 dollars a year
p32
aVto send a young person to prison in New Jersey.
p33
aVBut here, taxpayers are footing the bill
p34
aVand what kids are getting is a cold prison cell
p35
aVand a permanent mark against them when they come home
p36
aVand apply for work.
p37
aa(lp38
VThere are more and more kids on this journey to adulthood
p39
aVthan ever before in the United States and that's because in the past 40 years,
p40
aVour incarceration rate  has grown by 700 percent.
p41
aVI have one slide for this talk.
p42
aVHere it is.
p43
aVHere's our incarceration rate,
p44
aVabout 716 people per 100,000 in the population.
p45
aVHere's the OECD countries.
p46
aa(lp47
VWhat's more, it's poor kids that we're sending to prison,
p48
aVtoo many drawn from African-American and Latino communities
p49
aVso that prison now stands firmly between the young people trying to make it
p50
aVand the fulfillment of the American Dream.
p51
aVThe problem's actually  a bit worse than this
p52
aV'cause we're not just sending  poor kids to prison,
p53
aVwe're saddling poor kids with court fees,
p54
aVwith probation and parole restrictions,
p55
aVwith low-level warrants,
p56
aVwe're asking them to live  in halfway houses and on house arrest,
p57
aVand we're asking them  to negotiate a police force
p58
aVthat is entering poor communities of color,
p59
aVnot for the purposes  of promoting public safety,
p60
aVbut to make arrest counts, to line city coffers.
p61
aa(lp62
VThis is the hidden underside to our historic experiment in punishment:
p63
aVyoung people worried that at any moment, they will be stopped, searched and seized.
p64
aVNot just in the streets,  but in their homes,
p65
aVat school and at work.
p66
aa(lp67
VI got interested in this  other path to adulthood
p68
aVwhen I was myself a college student
p69
aVattending the University of Pennsylvania
p70
aVin the early 2000s.
p71
aVPenn sits within a historic  African-American neighborhood.
p72
aVSo you've got these two parallel journeys going on simultaneously:
p73
aVthe kids attending  this elite, private university,
p74
aVand the kids from  the adjacent neighborhood,
p75
aVsome of whom are making it to college,
p76
aVand many of whom  are being shipped to prison.
p77
aa(lp78
VIn my sophomore year, I started tutoring a young woman who was in high school
p79
aVwho lived about 10 minutes away from the university.
p80
aVSoon, her cousin came home  from a juvenile detention center.
p81
aVHe was 15, a freshman in high school.
p82
aVI began to get to know him  and his friends and family,
p83
aVand I asked him what he thought  about me writing about his life
p84
aVfor my senior thesis in college.
p85
aVThis senior thesis became a dissertation at Princeton
p86
aVand now a book.
p87
aa(lp88
VBy the end of my sophomore year,
p89
aVI moved into the neighborhood and I spent the next six years
p90
aa(lp91
Vtrying to understand what young people were facing as they came of age.
p92
aVThe first week I spent in this neighborhood,
p93
aVI saw two boys, five and seven years old,
p94
aVplay this game of chase,
p95
aVwhere the older boy ran after the other boy.
p96
aVHe played the cop.
p97
aVWhen the cop caught up to the younger boy,
p98
aVhe pushed him down,
p99
aVhandcuffed him with imaginary handcuffs,
p100
aVtook a quarter out of  the other child's pocket,
p101
aVsaying, "I'm seizing that."
p102
aVHe asked the child if  he was carrying any drugs
p103
aVor if he had a warrant.
p104
aVMany times, I saw this game repeated,
p105
aVsometimes children would  simply give up running,
p106
aVand stick their bodies flat  against the ground
p107
aVwith their hands above their heads, or flat up against a wall.
p108
aVChildren would yell at each other,
p109
aV"I'm going to lock you up,
p110
aVI'm going to lock you up and you're never coming home!"
p111
aVOnce I saw a six-year-old child pull another child's pants down
p112
aVand try to do a cavity search.
p113
aa(lp114
VIn the first 18 months that I lived in this neighborhood,
p115
aVI wrote down every time I saw any contact between police
p116
aVand people that were my neighbors.
p117
aVSo in the first 18 months,
p118
aVI watched the police stop  pedestrians or people in cars,
p119
aVsearch people, run people's names,
p120
aVchase people through the streets,
p121
aVpull people in for questioning,
p122
aVor make an arrest every single day, with five exceptions.
p123
aVFifty-two times, I watched the police break down doors,
p124
aVchase people through houses
p125
aVor make an arrest of someone in their home.
p126
aVFourteen times in this first year and a half,
p127
aVI watched the police punch, choke, kick, stomp on or beat young men
p128
aVafter they had caught them.
p129
aa(lp130
VBit by bit, I got to know two brothers,
p131
aVChuck and Tim.
p132
aVChuck was 18 when we met, a senior in high school.
p133
aVHe was playing on the basketball team and making C's and B's.
p134
aVHis younger brother, Tim, was 10.
p135
aVAnd Tim loved Chuck; he followed him around a lot,
p136
aVlooked to Chuck to be a mentor.
p137
aVThey lived with their mom and grandfather
p138
aVin a two-story row home  with a front lawn and a back porch.
p139
aVTheir mom was struggling with addiction all while the boys were growing up.
p140
aVShe never really was able  to hold down a job for very long.
p141
aVIt was their grandfather's pension that supported the family,
p142
aVnot really enough to pay for food and clothes
p143
aVand school supplies for growing boys.
p144
aVThe family was really struggling.
p145
aa(lp146
VSo when we met, Chuck was a senior in high school.
p147
aVHe had just turned 18.
p148
aVThat winter, a kid in the schoolyard
p149
aVcalled Chuck's mom a crack whore.
p150
aVChuck pushed the kid's face into the snow
p151
aVand the school cops charged him  with aggravated assault.
p152
aVThe other kid was fine the next day,
p153
aVI think it was his pride that was injured more than anything.
p154
aa(lp155
VBut anyway, since Chuck was 18,
p156
aVthis agg. assault case sent him  to adult county jail
p157
aVon State Road in northeast Philadelphia,
p158
aVwhere he sat, unable to pay the bail \u2014 he couldn't afford it \u2014
p159
aVwhile the trial dates  dragged on and on and on
p160
aVthrough almost his entire senior year.
p161
aVFinally, near the end of this season,
p162
aVthe judge on this assault case threw out most of the charges
p163
aVand Chuck came home
p164
aVwith only a few hundred dollars' worth of court fees hanging over his head.
p165
aVTim was pretty happy that day.
p166
aa(lp167
VThe next fall, Chuck tried  to re-enroll as a senior,
p168
aVbut the school secretary told him that
p169
aVhe was then 19 and too old  to be readmitted.
p170
aVThen the judge on his assault case issued him a warrant for his arrest
p171
aVbecause he couldn't pay  the 225 dollars in court fees
p172
aVthat came due a few weeks after the case ended.
p173
aVThen he was a high school dropout living on the run.
p174
aa(lp175
VTim's first arrest came later that year
p176
aVafter he turned 11.
p177
aVChuck had managed to get his warrant lifted
p178
aVand he was on a payment plan for the court fees
p179
aVand he was driving Tim to school in his girlfriend's car.
p180
aVSo a cop pulls them over, runs the car,
p181
aVand the car comes up  as stolen in California.
p182
aVChuck had no idea where in the history of this car it had been stolen.
p183
aVHis girlfriend's uncle bought it from a used car auction
p184
aVin northeast Philly.
p185
aVChuck and Tim had never been outside of the tri-state,
p186
aVlet alone to California.
p187
aVBut anyway, the cops down at the precinct
p188
aVcharged Chuck with  receiving stolen property.
p189
aVAnd then a juvenile judge,  a few days later,
p190
aVcharged Tim, age 11,
p191
aVwith accessory to receiving a stolen property
p192
aVand then he was placed on  three years of probation.
p193
aVWith this probation sentence  hanging over his head,
p194
aa(lp195
VChuck sat his little brother down
p196
aVand began teaching him how to run from the police.
p197
aVThey would sit side by side  on their back porch
p198
aVlooking out into the shared alleyway
p199
aVand Chuck would coach Tim how to spot undercover cars,
p200
aVhow to negotiate a late-night police raid, how and where to hide.
p201
aa(lp202
VI want you to imagine for a second
p203
aVwhat Chuck and Tim's lives would be like
p204
aVif they were living in a neighborhood where kids were going to college,
p205
aVnot prison.
p206
aVA neighborhood like the one  I got to grow up in.
p207
aVOkay, you might say.
p208
aVBut Chuck and Tim, kids like them, they're committing crimes!
p209
aVDon't they deserve to be in prison?
p210
aVDon't they deserve to be  living in fear of arrest?
p211
aVWell, my answer would be no.
p212
aVThey don't.
p213
aVAnd certainly not for the same things  that other young people
p214
aVwith more privilege are doing with impunity.
p215
aVIf Chuck had gone to my high school,
p216
aVthat schoolyard fight  would have ended there,
p217
aVas a schoolyard fight.
p218
aVIt never would have become an aggravated assault case.
p219
aVNot a single kid that I went to college with
p220
aVhas a criminal record right now.
p221
aVNot a single one.
p222
aVBut can you imagine how many might have if the police had stopped those kids
p223
aVand searched their pockets for drugs as they walked to class?
p224
aVOr had raided their frat parties in the middle of the night?
p225
aa(lp226
VOkay, you might say.
p227
aVBut doesn't this high incarceration rate
p228
aVpartly account for our  really low crime rate?
p229
aVCrime is down. That's a good thing.
p230
aVTotally, that is a good thing. Crime is down.
p231
aVIt dropped precipitously in the '90s and through the 2000s.
p232
aVBut according to a committee of academics
p233
aVconvened by the National Academy of Sciences last year,
p234
aVthe relationship between our historically high incarceration rates
p235
aVand our low crime rate is pretty shaky.
p236
aVIt turns out that the crime rate goes up and down
p237
aVirrespective of how many young people we send to prison.
p238
aa(lp239
VWe tend to think about justice in a pretty narrow way:
p240
aVgood and bad, innocent and guilty.
p241
aVInjustice is about being  wrongfully convicted.
p242
aVSo if you're convicted  of something you did do,
p243
aVyou should be punished for it.
p244
aVThere are innocent and guilty people,
p245
aVthere are victims and  there are perpetrators.
p246
aVMaybe we could think a little bit more broadly than that.
p247
aa(lp248
VRight now, we're asking kids who live in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods,
p249
aVwho have the least amount of family resources,
p250
aVwho are attending  the country's worst schools,
p251
aVwho are facing the toughest time in the labor market,
p252
aVwho are living in neighborhoods where violence is an everyday problem,
p253
aVwe're asking these kids to walk the thinnest possible line \u2014
p254
aVto basically never do anything wrong.
p255
aa(lp256
VWhy are we not providing support to young kids facing these challenges?
p257
aVWhy are we offering only handcuffs, jail time and this fugitive existence?
p258
aVCan we imagine something better?
p259
aVCan we imagine a criminal justice system that prioritizes recovery,
p260
aVprevention, civic inclusion,
p261
aVrather than punishment?
p262
aV(Applause)
p263
aVA criminal justice system  that acknowledges
p264
aVthe legacy of exclusion that poor people of color in the U.S. have faced
p265
aVand that does not promote and perpetuate those exclusions.
p266
aV(Applause)
p267
aVAnd finally, a criminal justice system that believes in black young people,
p268
aVrather than treating black young people  as the enemy to be rounded up.
p269
aV(Applause)
p270
aa(lp271
VThe good news is that we already are.
p272
aVA few years ago, Michelle Alexander wrote "The New Jim Crow,"
p273
aVwhich got Americans to see  incarceration as a civil rights issue
p274
aVof historic proportions in a way they had not seen it before.
p275
aVPresident Obama and Attorney General  Eric Holder have come out very strongly
p276
aVon sentencing reform,
p277
aVon the need to address  racial disparity in incarceration.
p278
aVWe're seeing states throw out Stop and Frisk
p279
aVas the civil rights violation that it is.
p280
aVWe're seeing cities and states decriminalize possession of marijuana.
p281
aVNew York, New Jersey and California
p282
aVhave been dropping their  prison populations, closing prisons,
p283
aVwhile also seeing a big drop in crime.
p284
aVTexas has gotten into the game now,
p285
aValso closing prisons,  investing in education.
p286
aVThis curious coalition is building  from the right and the left,
p287
aVmade up of former prisoners and fiscal conservatives,
p288
aVof civil rights activists and libertarians,
p289
aVof young people taking to the streets to protest police violence
p290
aVagainst unarmed black teenagers,
p291
aVand older, wealthier people \u2014
p292
aVsome of you are here in the audience \u2014
p293
aVpumping big money into  decarceration initiatives
p294
aVIn a deeply divided Congress,
p295
aVthe work of reforming  our criminal justice system
p296
aVis just about the only thing that the right and the left
p297
aVare coming together on.
p298
aa(lp299
VI did not think I would see this political moment in my lifetime.
p300
aVI think many of the people who have been working tirelessly
p301
aVto write about the causes and consequences
p302
aVof our historically  high incarceration rates
p303
aVdid not think we would see this moment in our lifetime.
p304
aVThe question for us now is, how much can we make of it?
p305
aVHow much can we change?
p306
aa(lp307
VI want to end with a call to young people,
p308
aVthe young people attending college
p309
aVand the young people struggling to stay out of prison
p310
aVor to make it through prison and return home.
p311
aVIt may seem like these paths to adulthood are worlds apart,
p312
aVbut the young people participating in these two institutions
p313
aVconveying us to adulthood,
p314
aVthey have one thing in common:
p315
aVBoth can be leaders in the work of reforming our criminal justice system.
p316
aVYoung people have always been leaders in the fight for equal rights,
p317
aVthe fight for more people  to be granted dignity
p318
aVand a fighting chance at freedom.
p319
aVThe mission for the generation  of young people
p320
aVcoming of age in this, a sea-change moment, potentially,
p321
aVis to end mass incarceration and  build a new criminal justice system,
p322
aVemphasis on the word justice.
p323
