VOkay, this morning I'm speaking
p4
aVon the question of corruption.
p5
aVAnd corruption is defined
p6
aVas the abuse of a position of trust
p7
aVfor the benefit of yourself \u2014 or, in the case of our context,
p8
aVyour friends, your family or your financiers.
p9
aVOkay? Friends, family and financiers.
p10
aVBut we need to understand what we understand about corruption,
p11
aVand we need to understand that
p12
aVwe have been miseducated about it, and we have to admit that.
p13
aVWe have to have the courage to admit that
p14
aVto start changing how we deal with it.
p15
aa(lp16
VThe first thing is that the big myth, number one,
p17
aVis that in fact it's not really a crime.
p18
aVWhen we get together with friends and family
p19
aVand we discuss crime in our country,
p20
aVcrime in Belmont or crime in Diego or crime in Marabella,
p21
aVnobody's speaking about corruption.
p22
aVThat's the honest truth.
p23
aVWhen the Commissioner of Police comes on TV to talk about crime,
p24
aVhe isn't speaking about corruption.
p25
aVAnd we know for sure when the Minister of National Security
p26
aVis speaking about crime, he's not talking about corruption either.
p27
aVThe point I'm making is that it is a crime.
p28
aVIt is an economic crime, because we're involving the looting of taxpayers' money.
p29
aVPublic and private corruption is a reality.
p30
aVAs somebody who comes from the private sector,
p31
aVI can tell you there's a massive amount of corruption
p32
aVin the private sector that has nothing to do with government.
p33
aVThe same bribes and backhanders and things that take place under the table,
p34
aVit all takes place in the private sector.
p35
aVToday, I'm focusing on public sector corruption,
p36
aVwhich the private sector also participates in.
p37
aa(lp38
VThe second important myth to understand \u2014
p39
aVbecause we have to destroy these myths,
p40
aVdismantle them and destroy them and ridicule them \u2014
p41
aVthe second important myth to understand
p42
aVis the one that says
p43
aVthat in fact corruption is only a small problem \u2014
p44
aVif it is a problem, it's only a small problem,
p45
aVthat in fact it's only a little 10 or 15 percent,
p46
aVit's been going on forever, it probably will continue forever,
p47
aVand there's no point passing any laws, because there's little we can do about it.
p48
aVAnd I want to demonstrate that that, too,
p49
aVis a dangerous myth, very dangerous.
p50
aVIt's a piece of public mischief.
p51
aa(lp52
VAnd I want to speak a little bit,
p53
aVtake us back about 30 years.
p54
aVWe're coming out today from Trinidad and Tobago,
p55
aVa resource-rich, small Caribbean country,
p56
aVand in the early 1970s we had a massive increase in the country's wealth,
p57
aVand that increase was caused by the increase in world oil prices.
p58
aVWe call them petrodollars. The treasury was bursting with money.
p59
aVAnd it's ironic, because
p60
aVwe're standing today in the Central Bank.
p61
aVYou see, history's rich in irony.
p62
aVWe're standing today in the Central Bank,
p63
aVand the Central Bank is responsible for a lot of the things I'm going to be speaking about.
p64
aVOkay? We're talking about irresponsibility in public office.
p65
aVWe're speaking about the fact that across the terrace,
p66
aVthe next tower is the Ministry of Finance,
p67
aVand there's a lot of connection with us today,
p68
aVso we're speaking within your temple today. Okay?
p69
aa(lp70
V(Applause)
p71
aa(lp72
VThe first thing I want to talk about is that
p73
aVwhen all of this money flowed into our country about 40 years ago,
p74
aVwe embarked, the government of the day embarked
p75
aVon a series of government-to-government arrangements
p76
aVto have rapidly develop the country.
p77
aVAnd some of the largest projects in the country
p78
aVwere being constructed through government-to-government arrangements
p79
aVwith some of the leading countries in the world,
p80
aVthe United States and Britain and France and so on and so on.
p81
aVAs I said, even this building we're standing in \u2014 that's one of the ironies \u2014
p82
aVthis building was part of that series of complexes,
p83
aVwhat they called the Twin Towers.
p84
aVIt became so outrageous, the whole situation,
p85
aVthat in fact a commission of inquiry was appointed,
p86
aVand it reported in 1982, 30 years ago it reported \u2014
p87
aVthe Ballah Report \u2014 30 years ago,
p88
aVand immediately the government-to-government arrangements were stopped.
p89
aVThe then-Prime Minister went to Parliament
p90
aVto give a budget speech, and he said some things that I'll never forget.
p91
aVThey went right in here. I was a young man at the time.
p92
aVIt went right into my heart.
p93
aVAnd he said that, in fact \u2014 Let me see if this thing works.
p94
aVAre we getting a, yeah?\u2014
p95
aVThat's what he told us.
p96
aVHe told us that, in fact,
p97
aVtwo out of every three dollars of our petrodollars
p98
aVthat we spent, the taxpayers' money,
p99
aVwas wasted or stolen.
p100
aVSo the 10 or 15 percent is pure mischief.
p101
aVAs we say, it's a nancy-story. Forget it.
p102
aVThat's for little children. We are big people,
p103
aVand we're trying to deal with what's happening in our society.
p104
aVOkay? This is the size of the problem.
p105
aVOkay? Two thirds of the money stolen or wasted.
p106
aVThat was 30 years ago. 1982 was Ballah.
p107
aa(lp108
VSo what has changed?
p109
aVI don't like to bring up embarrassing secrets
p110
aVto an international audience, but I have to.
p111
aVFour months ago, we suffered a constitutional outrage in this country.
p112
aVWe call it the Section 34 fiasco, the Section 34 fiasco,
p113
aVa suspicious piece of law, and I'm going to say it like it is,
p114
aVa suspicious piece of law
p115
aVwas passed at a suspicious time
p116
aVto free some suspects. (Laughter)
p117
aVAnd it was called, those people are called
p118
aVthe Piarco Airport accused.
p119
aVI'm going to have my own lexicon speaking here today.
p120
aVThey are the Piarco Airport accused.
p121
aVIt was a constitutional outrage of the first order,
p122
aVand I have labeled it the Plot to Pervert Parliament.
p123
aVOur highest institution in our country was perverted.
p124
aVWe are dealing with perverts here
p125
aVof an economic and financial nature.
p126
aVDo you get how serious this problem is?
p127
aVThere was massive protest. A lot of us in this room
p128
aVtook part in the protest in different forms.
p129
aVMost importantly, the American embassy complained,
p130
aVso Parliament was swiftly reconvened,
p131
aVand the law was reversed, it was repealed.
p132
aVThat's the word lawyers use. It was repealed.
p133
aVBut the point is
p134
aVthat Parliament was outwitted in the whole course of events,
p135
aVbecause what really happened is that,
p136
aVbecause of the suspicious passage of that law,
p137
aVthe law was actually passed into effect
p138
aVon the weekend we celebrated our 50th anniversary of independence,
p139
aVour jubilee of independence.
p140
aVSo that is the kind of outrage of the thing.
p141
aVIt was kind of a nasty way to get maturation, but we got it,
p142
aVbecause we all understood it,
p143
aVand for the first time that I could remember,
p144
aVthere were mass protests against this corruption.
p145
aVAnd that gave me a lot of hope. Okay?
p146
aVThose of us who are, sometimes you feel like
p147
aVyou're a little bit on your own doing some of this work.
p148
aVThat passage of the law and the repeal of the law
p149
aVfortified the case of the Piarco Airport accused.
p150
aVSo it was one of those really superior double bluff kind of things that took place.
p151
aa(lp152
VBut what were they accused of?
p153
aVWhat was it that they were accused of?
p154
aVI'm being a bit mysterious for those of you out there. What were they accused of?
p155
aVWe were trying to build, or reconstruct largely,
p156
aVan airport that had grown outdated.
p157
aVThe entire project cost about 1.6 billion dollars,
p158
aVTrinidad and Tobago dollars,
p159
aVand in fact, we had a lot of bid-rigging
p160
aVand suspicious activity, corrupt activity took place.
p161
aVAnd to get an idea of what it consisted of,
p162
aVand to put it in context in relationship to this whole
p163
aVsecond myth about it being no big thing,
p164
aVwe can look at this second slide here.
p165
aVAnd what we have here \u2014 I am not saying so,
p166
aVthis is the Director of Public Prosecutions in a written statement. He said so.
p167
aVAnd he's telling us that for the $1.6 billion cost of the project,
p168
aVone billion dollars has been traced
p169
aVto offshore bank accounts.
p170
aVOne billion dollars of our taxpayers' money
p171
aVhas been located in offshore bank accounts.
p172
aa(lp173
VBeing the kind of suspicious person I am,
p174
aVI am outraged at that, and I'm going to pause here,
p175
aVI'm going to pause now and again and bring in different things.
p176
aVI'm going to pause here and bring in something I saw
p177
aVin November last year at Wall Street. I was at Zuccotti Park.
p178
aVIt was autumn. It was cool. It was damp. It was getting dark.
p179
aVAnd I was walking around with the protesters
p180
aVlooking at the One Wall Street, Occupy Wall Street movement walking around.
p181
aVAnd there was a lady with a sign, a very simple sign,
p182
aVa kind of battered-looking blonde lady,
p183
aVand the sign was made out of Bristol board, as we say in these parts,
p184
aVand it was made with a marker.
p185
aVAnd what it said on that sign hit me right in the center.
p186
aVIt said, "If you're not outraged, you haven't been paying attention."
p187
aVIf you're not outraged by all of this, you haven't been paying attention.
p188
aVSo listen up, because we're getting into even deeper waters.
p189
aa(lp190
VMy brain started thinking.
p191
aVWell, what if \u2014
p192
aVbecause I'm suspicious like that. I read a lot of spy novels and stuff.
p193
aVWhat if \u2014 (Laughter)
p194
aVBut to make it in these wrongs,
p195
aVyou have to read a lot of spy novels
p196
aVand follow some of that stuff, right? (Laughter)
p197
aVBut what if this wasn't the first time?
p198
aVWhat if this is just the first time
p199
aVthat the so-and-sos had been caught?
p200
aVWhat if it had happened before? How would I find out?
p201
aVNow, the previous two examples I gave
p202
aVwere to do with construction sector corruption, okay?
p203
aVAnd I have the privilege at this time
p204
aVto lead the Joint Consultative Council, which is a not-for-profit.
p205
aVWe're at jcc.org.tt, and we have the \u2014 we are the leaders
p206
aVin the struggle to produce a new public procurement system
p207
aVabout how public money is transacted.
p208
aVSo those of you interested in finding out more about it,
p209
aVor joining us or signing up on any of our petitions, please get involved.
p210
aa(lp211
VBut I'm going to segue to another thing that relates,
p212
aVbecause one of my private campaigns I've been conducting
p213
aVfor over three and a half years
p214
aVis for transparency and accountability
p215
aVaround the bailout of CL Financial.
p216
aVCL Financial is the Caribbean's largest ever conglomerate, okay?
p217
aVAnd without getting into all of the details,
p218
aVit is said to have collapsed \u2014 I'm using my words very carefully \u2014
p219
aVit's said to have collapsed in January of '09,
p220
aVwhich is just coming up to nearly four years.
p221
aVIn an unprecedented fit of generosity \u2014
p222
aVand you have to be very suspicious about these people \u2014
p223
aVin an unprecedented \u2014 and I'm using that word carefully \u2014
p224
aVunprecedented fit of generosity, the government of the day
p225
aVsigned, made a written commitment, to repay all of the creditors.
p226
aVAnd I can tell you without fear of contradiction
p227
aVthat hasn't happened anywhere else on the planet.
p228
aVLet's understand, because we lack context.
p229
aVPeople are telling us it's just like Wall Street. It's not just like Wall Street.
p230
aVTrinidad and Tobago is like a place with different laws of physics or biology or something.
p231
aVIt's not just like anywhere. (Applause)
p232
aVIt's not just like anywhere. It's not just like anywhere.
p233
aVHere is here, and out there is out there. Okay?
p234
aVI'm serious now.
p235
aVListen. They've had bailouts on Wall Street.
p236
aVThey've had bailouts in London.
p237
aVThey've had bailouts in Europe.
p238
aVIn Africa, they've had bailouts. In Nigeria, six of the major
p239
aVcommercial banks collapsed at the same time as ours, eh?
p240
aVIt's interesting to parallel how the Nigerian experience has \u2014
p241
aVhow they've treated it, and they've treated it
p242
aVvery well compared to us.
p243
aVNowhere on the planet
p244
aVhave all the creditors been bailed out
p245
aVin excess of what their statutory entitlements were.
p246
aVOnly here. So what was the reason for the generosity?
p247
aVIs our government that generous? And maybe they are.
p248
aVLet's look at it. Let's look into it.
p249
aa(lp250
VSo I started digging and writing and so and so on,
p251
aVand that work can be found, my personal work
p252
aVcan be found at AfraRaymond.com, which is my name.
p253
aVIt's a not-for-profit blog that I run.
p254
aVNot as popular as some of the other people, but there you go.
p255
aV(Laughter)
p256
aVBut the point is that the bitter experience of Section 34,
p257
aVthat plot to pervert Parliament, that bitter experience
p258
aVthat took place in August,
p259
aVwhen we were supposed to be celebrating our independence,
p260
aVgoing into September, forced me to check myself
p261
aVand recalculate my bearings,
p262
aVand to go back into some of the work, some of the stuff I'd written
p263
aVand some of the exchanges I'd had with the officials
p264
aVto see what was really what.
p265
aVAs we say in Trinidad and Tobago, who is who and what is what?
p266
aVOkay? We want to try to recalculate.
p267
aa(lp268
VAnd I made a Freedom of Information application
p269
aVin May this year to the Ministry of Finance.
p270
aVThe Ministry of Finance is the next tower over.
p271
aVThis is the other context.
p272
aVThe Ministry of Finance, we are told,
p273
aVis subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.
p274
aVI'm going to take you through a worked example of whether that's really so.
p275
aVThe Central Bank in which we stand this morning
p276
aVis immune from the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.
p277
aVSo in fact, you can't ask them anything,
p278
aVand they don't have to answer anything.
p279
aVThat is the law since 1999.
p280
aa(lp281
VSo I plunged into this struggle, and I asked four questions.
p282
aVAnd I'll relate the questions to you in the short form with the reply,
p283
aVso you could understand, as I said, where we are.
p284
aVHere is not like anywhere else.
p285
aa(lp286
VQuestion number one:
p287
aVI asked to see the accounts of CL Financial,
p288
aVand if you can't show me the accounts \u2014
p289
aVthe Minister of Finance is making statements,
p290
aVpassing new laws and giving speeches and so on.
p291
aVWhat are the figures he's relying on?
p292
aVIt's like that joke: I want whatever he's drinking.
p293
aVAnd they wrote back and said to me,
p294
aVwell what do you really mean?
p295
aVSo they hit my question with a question.
p296
aa(lp297
VSecond point: I want to see
p298
aVwho are the creditors of the group who have been repaid?
p299
aVLet me pause here to point out to you all
p300
aVthat 24 billion dollars of our money has been spent on this.
p301
aVThat is about three and a half billion U.S. dollars
p302
aVcoming out of a small \u2014 we used to be resource-rich \u2014
p303
aVCaribbean country. Okay?
p304
aVAnd I asked the question,
p305
aVwho was getting that three and a half billion dollars?
p306
aa(lp307
VAnd I want to pause again to bring up context,
p308
aVbecause context helps us to get clarity understanding this thing.
p309
aVThere's a particular individual who is in the government now.
p310
aVThe name of the person doesn't matter.
p311
aVAnd that person made a career
p312
aVout of using the Freedom of Information Act
p313
aVto advance his political cause.
p314
aVOkay? His name isn't important.
p315
aVI wouldn't dignify it. I'm on a point.
p316
aVThe point is, that person made a career out of using
p317
aVthe Freedom of Information Act to advance his cause.
p318
aVAnd the most famous case
p319
aVwas what we came to call the Secret Scholarship Scandal,
p320
aVwhere in fact there was about 60 million dollars in government money
p321
aVthat had been dispersed in a series of scholarships,
p322
aVand the scholarships hadn't been advertised, and so and so on and so on.
p323
aVAnd he was able to get the court, using that act of Parliament,
p324
aVFreedom of Information Act,
p325
aVto release the information,
p326
aVand I thought that was excellent.
p327
aVFantastic.
p328
aVBut you see, the question is this:
p329
aVIf it's right and proper for us to use the Freedom of Information Act
p330
aVand to use the court
p331
aVto force a disclosure about 60 million dollars in public money,
p332
aVit must be right and proper
p333
aVfor us to force a disclosure about 24 billion dollars.
p334
aVYou see? But the Ministry of Finance,
p335
aVthe Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance,
p336
aVwrote me and said to me, that information is exempt too.
p337
aVYou see? This is what we're dealing with, okay?
p338
aa(lp339
VThe third thing I will tell you
p340
aVis that I also asked
p341
aVfor the directors of CL Financial,
p342
aVwhether in fact they were making filings under our Integrity in Public Life Act.
p343
aVWe have an Integrity in Public Life Act
p344
aVas part of our framework supposed to safeguard the nation's interest.
p345
aVAnd public officials are supposed to file
p346
aVto say what it is they have in terms of assets and liabilities.
p347
aVAnd of course I've since discovered that they're not filing,
p348
aVand in fact the Minister of Finance has not even asked them to file.
p349
aVSo here we have it. We have a situation where
p350
aVthe basic safeguards of integrity and accountability
p351
aVand transparency have all been discarded.
p352
aVI've asked the question in the legal and required fashion.
p353
aVIt's been ignored.
p354
aa(lp355
VThe sort of thing that motivated us around Section 34,
p356
aVwe need to continue to work on that. We can't forget it.
p357
aVI have defined this as the single largest expenditure in the country's history.
p358
aVIt's also the single largest example
p359
aVof public corruption according to this equation.
p360
aa(lp361
VAnd this is my reality check.
p362
aVWhere you have an expenditure of public money
p363
aVand it is without accountability
p364
aVand it's without transparency,
p365
aVit will always be equal to corruption,
p366
aVwhether you're in Russia or Nigeria or Alaska,
p367
aVit will always be equal to corruption, and that is what we are dealing with here.
p368
aa(lp369
VI'm going to continue the work
p370
aVto press on, to get some resolution
p371
aVof those matters at the Ministry of Finance.
p372
aVIf it is I have to go to court personally, I will do that.
p373
aVWe will continue to press on.
p374
aVWe will continue to work within JCC.
p375
aa(lp376
VBut I want to step back from the Trinidad and Tobago context
p377
aVand bring something new to the table
p378
aVin terms of an international example.
p379
aVWe had the journalist [Heather] Brooke speaking
p380
aVabout her battle against government corruption,
p381
aVand she introduced me to this website, Alaveteli.com.
p382
aVAnd Alaveteli.com is a way for us to have an open database
p383
aVfor Freedom of Information applications,
p384
aVand speak with each other.
p385
aVI could see what you're applying for.
p386
aVYou could see what I applied for and what replies I got.
p387
aVWe can work on it together. We need to build a collective database
p388
aVand a collective understanding of where we are to go to the next point.
p389
aVWe need to increase the consciousness.
p390
aa(lp391
VThe final thing I want to say is in relation to this one,
p392
aVwhich is a lovely website from India
p393
aVcalled IPaidABribe.com.
p394
aVThey have international branches,
p395
aVand it's important for us to tune into this one.
p396
aVIPaidABribe.com is really important,
p397
aVa good one to log on to and see.
p398
aa(lp399
VI'm going to pause there. I'm going to ask you for your courage.
p400
aVDiscard the first myth; it is a crime.
p401
aVDiscard the second myth; it is a big thing.
p402
aVIt's a huge problem. It's an economic crime.
p403
aVAnd let us continue working together
p404
aVto betterment in this situation,
p405
aVstability and sustainability in our society. Thank you.
