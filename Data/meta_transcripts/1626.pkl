VI'd like to show you a video of some of the models
p4
aVI work with.
p5
aVThey're all the perfect size, and they don't have an ounce of fat.
p6
aVDid I mention they're gorgeous?
p7
aVAnd they're scientific models? (Laughs)
p8
aa(lp9
VAs you might have guessed, I'm a tissue engineer,
p10
aVand this is a video of some of the beating heart
p11
aVthat I've engineered in the lab.
p12
aVAnd one day we hope that these tissues
p13
aVcan serve as replacement parts for the human body.
p14
aVBut what I'm going to tell you about today
p15
aVis how these tissues make awesome models.
p16
aa(lp17
VWell, let's think about the drug screening process for a moment.
p18
aVYou go from drug formulation, lab testing, animal testing,
p19
aVand then clinical trials, which you might call human testing,
p20
aVbefore the drugs get to market.
p21
aVIt costs a lot of money, a lot of time,
p22
aVand sometimes, even when a drug hits the market,
p23
aVit acts in an unpredictable way and actually hurts people.
p24
aVAnd the later it fails, the worse the consequences.
p25
aa(lp26
VIt all boils down to two issues. One, humans are not rats,
p27
aVand two, despite our incredible similarities to one another,
p28
aVactually those tiny differences between you and I
p29
aVhave huge impacts with how we metabolize drugs
p30
aVand how those drugs affect us.
p31
aa(lp32
VSo what if we had better models in the lab
p33
aVthat could not only mimic us better than rats
p34
aVbut also reflect our diversity?
p35
aVLet's see how we can do it with tissue engineering.
p36
aa(lp37
VOne of the key technologies that's really important
p38
aVis what's called induced pluripotent stem cells.
p39
aVThey were developed in Japan pretty recently.
p40
aVOkay, induced pluripotent stem cells.
p41
aVThey're a lot like embryonic stem cells
p42
aVexcept without the controversy.
p43
aVWe induce cells, okay, say, skin cells,
p44
aVby adding a few genes to them, culturing them,
p45
aVand then harvesting them.
p46
aVSo they're skin cells that can be tricked,
p47
aVkind of like cellular amnesia, into an embryonic state.
p48
aVSo without the controversy, that's cool thing number one.
p49
aVCool thing number two, you can grow any type of tissue
p50
aVout of them: brain, heart, liver, you get the picture,
p51
aVbut out of your cells.
p52
aVSo we can make a model of your heart, your brain
p53
aVon a chip.
p54
aa(lp55
VGenerating tissues of predictable density and behavior
p56
aVis the second piece, and will be really key towards
p57
aVgetting these models to be adopted for drug discovery.
p58
aVAnd this is a schematic of a bioreactor we're developing in our lab
p59
aVto help engineer tissues in a more modular, scalable way.
p60
aVGoing forward, imagine a massively parallel version of this
p61
aVwith thousands of pieces of human tissue.
p62
aVIt would be like having a clinical trial on a chip.
p63
aa(lp64
VBut another thing about these induced pluripotent stem cells
p65
aVis that if we take some skin cells, let's say,
p66
aVfrom people with a genetic disease
p67
aVand we engineer tissues out of them,
p68
aVwe can actually use tissue-engineering techniques
p69
aVto generate models of those diseases in the lab.
p70
aVHere's an example from Kevin Eggan's lab at Harvard.
p71
aVHe generated neurons
p72
aVfrom these induced pluripotent stem cells
p73
aVfrom patients who have Lou Gehrig's Disease,
p74
aVand he differentiated them into neurons, and what's amazing
p75
aVis that these neurons also show symptoms of the disease.
p76
aVSo with disease models like these, we can fight back
p77
aVfaster than ever before and understand the disease better
p78
aVthan ever before, and maybe discover drugs even faster.
p79
aVThis is another example of patient-specific stem cells
p80
aVthat were engineered from someone with retinitis pigmentosa.
p81
aVThis is a degeneration of the retina.
p82
aVIt's a disease that runs in my family, and we really hope
p83
aVthat cells like these will help us find a cure.
p84
aa(lp85
VSo some people think that these models sound well and good,
p86
aVbut ask, "Well, are these really as good as the rat?"
p87
aVThe rat is an entire organism, after all,
p88
aVwith interacting networks of organs.
p89
aVA drug for the heart can get metabolized in the liver,
p90
aVand some of the byproducts may be stored in the fat.
p91
aVDon't you miss all that with these tissue-engineered models?
p92
aVWell, this is another trend in the field.
p93
aVBy combining tissue engineering techniques with microfluidics,
p94
aVthe field is actually evolving towards just that,
p95
aVa model of the entire ecosystem of the body,
p96
aVcomplete with multiple organ systems to be able to test
p97
aVhow a drug you might take for your blood pressure
p98
aVmight affect your liver or an antidepressant might affect your heart.
p99
aVThese systems are really hard to build, but we're just starting to be able to get there,
p100
aVand so, watch out.
p101
aa(lp102
VBut that's not even all of it, because once a drug is approved,
p103
aVtissue engineering techniques can actually help us develop more personalized treatments.
p104
aVThis is an example that you might care about someday,
p105
aVand I hope you never do,
p106
aVbecause imagine if you ever get that call
p107
aVthat gives you that bad news that you might have cancer.
p108
aVWouldn't you rather test to see if those cancer drugs
p109
aVyou're going to take are going to work on your cancer?
p110
aVThis is an example from Karen Burg's lab, where they're
p111
aVusing inkjet technologies to print breast cancer cells
p112
aVand study its progressions and treatments.
p113
aVAnd some of our colleagues at Tufts are mixing models
p114
aVlike these with tissue-engineered bone to see how cancer
p115
aVmight spread from one part of the body to the next,
p116
aVand you can imagine those kinds of multi-tissue chips
p117
aVto be the next generation of these kinds of studies.
p118
aa(lp119
VAnd so thinking about the models that we've just discussed,
p120
aVyou can see, going forward, that tissue engineering
p121
aVis actually poised to help revolutionize drug screening
p122
aVat every single step of the path:
p123
aVdisease models making for better drug formulations,
p124
aVmassively parallel human tissue models helping to revolutionize lab testing,
p125
aVreduce animal testing and human testing in clinical trials,
p126
aVand individualized therapies that disrupt
p127
aVwhat we even consider to be a market at all.
p128
aVEssentially, we're dramatically speeding up that feedback
p129
aVbetween developing a molecule and learning about
p130
aVhow it acts in the human body.
p131
aVOur process for doing this is essentially transforming
p132
aVbiotechnology and pharmacology into an information technology,
p133
aVhelping us discover and evaluate drugs faster,
p134
aVmore cheaply and more effectively.
p135
aVIt gives new meaning to models against animal testing, doesn't it?
p136
aVThank you. (Applause)
