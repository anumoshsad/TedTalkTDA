VLet me tell you a story
p4
aVabout a little girl named Naghma.
p5
aVNaghma lived in a refugee camp
p6
aVwith her parents and her eight brothers and sisters.
p7
aVEvery morning, her father would wake up
p8
aVin the hopes he'd be picked for construction work,
p9
aVand on a good month he would earn 50 dollars.
p10
aVThe winter was very harsh,
p11
aVand unfortunately, Naghma's brother died
p12
aVand her mother became very ill.
p13
aVIn desperation, her father went to a neighbor
p14
aVto borrow 2,500 dollars.
p15
aVAfter several months of waiting,
p16
aVthe neighbor became very impatient,
p17
aVand he demanded that he be paid back.
p18
aVUnfortunately, Naghma's father didn't have the money,
p19
aVand so the two men agreed to a jirga.
p20
aVSo simply put, a jirga is a form of mediation
p21
aVthat's used in Afghanistan's  informal justice system.
p22
aVIt's usually presided over by religious leaders
p23
aVand village elders,
p24
aVand jirgas are often used in rural countries like Afghanistan,
p25
aVwhere there's deep-seated resentment
p26
aVagainst the formal system.
p27
aVAt the jirga, the men sat together
p28
aVand they decided that the  best way to satisfy the debt
p29
aVwould be if Naghma married the neighbor's 21-year-old son.
p30
aVShe was six.
p31
aa(lp32
VNow, stories like Naghma's unfortunately
p33
aVare all too common,
p34
aVand from the comforts of our home,
p35
aVwe may look at these stories as another
p36
aVcrushing blow to women's rights.
p37
aVAnd if you watched Afghanistan on the news,
p38
aVyou may have this view that it's a failed state.
p39
aVHowever, Afghanistan does have a legal system,
p40
aVand while jirgas are built on long-standing tribal customs,
p41
aVeven in jirgas, laws are supposed to be followed,
p42
aVand it goes without saying
p43
aVthat giving a child to satisfy a debt
p44
aVis not only grossly immoral, it's illegal.
p45
aa(lp46
VIn 2008, I went to Afghanistan
p47
aVfor a justice funded program,
p48
aVand I went there originally  on this nine-month program
p49
aVto train Afghan lawyers.
p50
aVIn that nine months, I went around the country
p51
aVand I talked to hundreds of people that were locked up,
p52
aVand I talked to many businesses
p53
aVthat were also operating in Afghanistan.
p54
aVAnd within these conversations,
p55
aVI started hearing the connections
p56
aVbetween the businesses and the people,
p57
aVand how laws that were meant to protect them
p58
aVwere being underused,
p59
aVwhile gross and illegal punitive measures were overused.
p60
aVAnd so this put me on a quest for justness,
p61
aVand what justness means to me
p62
aVis using laws for their intended purpose,
p63
aVwhich is to protect.
p64
aVThe role of laws is to protect.
p65
aVSo as a result, I decided to  open up a private practice,
p66
aVand I became the first foreigner to litigate
p67
aVin Afghan courts.
p68
aVThroughout this time, I also studied many laws,
p69
aVI talked to many people,
p70
aVI read up on many cases,
p71
aVand I found that the lack of justness
p72
aVis not just a problem in Afghanistan,
p73
aVbut it's a global problem.
p74
aVAnd while I originally shied away from
p75
aVrepresenting human rights cases
p76
aVbecause I was really concerned about how it would
p77
aVaffect me both professionally and personally,
p78
aVI decided that the need for justness was so great
p79
aVthat I couldn't continue to ignore it.
p80
aVAnd so I started representing people like Naghma
p81
aVpro bono also.
p82
aa(lp83
VNow, since I've been in Afghanistan
p84
aVand since I've been an attorney for over 10 years,
p85
aVI've represented from CEOs  of Fortune 500 companies
p86
aVto ambassadors to little girls like Naghma,
p87
aVand with much success.
p88
aVAnd the reason for my success is very simple:
p89
aVI work the system from the inside out
p90
aVand use the laws in the ways
p91
aVthat they're intended to be used.
p92
aa(lp93
VI find that
p94
aVachieving justness in places like Afghanistan
p95
aVis difficult, and there's three reasons.
p96
aVThe first reason is that simply put,
p97
aVpeople are very uneducated as to what their legal rights were,
p98
aVand I find that this is a global problem.
p99
aVThe second issue
p100
aVis that even with laws on the books,
p101
aVit's often superseded or ignored
p102
aVby tribal customs, like in the first jirga
p103
aVthat sold Naghma off.
p104
aVAnd the third problem with achieving justness
p105
aVis that even with good, existing laws on the books,
p106
aVthere aren't people or lawyers  that are willing to fight
p107
aVfor those laws.
p108
aVAnd that's what I do: I use existing laws,
p109
aVoften unused laws,
p110
aVand I work those to the benefits of my clients.
p111
aVWe all need to create a global culture
p112
aVof human rights
p113
aVand be investors in a global  human rights economy,
p114
aVand by working in this mindset,
p115
aVwe can significantly improve justice globally.
p116
aa(lp117
VNow let's get back to Naghma.
p118
aVSeveral people heard about this story,
p119
aVand so they contacted me because they wanted
p120
aVto pay the $2,500 debt.
p121
aVAnd it's not just that simple;
p122
aVyou can't just throw money at this problem
p123
aVand think that it's going to disappear.
p124
aVThat's not how it works in Afghanistan.
p125
aVSo I told them I'd get involved,
p126
aVbut in order to get involved,  what needed to happen
p127
aVis a second jirga needed to be called,
p128
aVa jirga of appeals.
p129
aVAnd so in order for that to happen,
p130
aVwe needed to get the village elders together,
p131
aVwe needed to get the tribal leaders together,
p132
aVthe religious leaders.
p133
aVNaghma's father needed to agree,
p134
aVthe neighbor needed to agree,
p135
aVand also his son needed to agree.
p136
aVAnd I thought, if I'm going to  get involved in this thing,
p137
aVthen they also need to agree  that I preside over it.
p138
aa(lp139
VSo, after hours of talking
p140
aVand tracking them down,
p141
aVand about 30 cups of tea,
p142
aVthey finally agreed that we could sit down
p143
aVfor a second jirga, and we did.
p144
aVAnd what was different about the second jirga
p145
aVis this time, we put the law at the center of it,
p146
aVand it was very important for me
p147
aVthat they all understood that Naghma
p148
aVhad a right to be protected.
p149
aVAnd at the end of this jirga,
p150
aVit was ordered by the judge
p151
aVthat the first decision was erased,
p152
aVand that the $2,500 debt was satisfied,
p153
aVand we all signed a written order
p154
aVwhere all the men acknowledged
p155
aVthat what they did was illegal,
p156
aVand if they did it again, that  they would go to prison.
p157
aVMost \u2014
p158
aV(Applause)
p159
aVThanks.
p160
aVAnd most importantly,
p161
aVthe engagement was terminated
p162
aVand Naghma was free.
p163
aVProtecting Naghma and her right to be free
p164
aVprotects us.
p165
aa(lp166
VNow, with my job, there's above-average
p167
aVamount of risks that are involved.
p168
aVI've been temporarily detained.
p169
aVI've been accused of running a brothel,
p170
aVaccused of being a spy.
p171
aVI've had a grenade thrown at my office.
p172
aVIt didn't go off, though.
p173
aVBut I find that with my job,
p174
aVthat the rewards far outweigh the risks,
p175
aVand as many risks as I take,
p176
aVmy clients take far greater risks,
p177
aVbecause they have a lot more to lose
p178
aVif their cases go unheard,
p179
aVor worse, if they're penalized for having me as their lawyer.
p180
aVWith every case that I take,
p181
aVI realize that as much as I'm standing behind my clients,
p182
aVthat they're also standing behind me,
p183
aVand that's what keeps me going.
p184
aa(lp185
VLaw as a point of leverage
p186
aVis crucial in protecting all of us.
p187
aVJournalists are very vital in making sure
p188
aVthat that information is given to the public.
p189
aVToo often, we receive information from journalists
p190
aVbut we forget how that information was given.
p191
aVThis picture is a picture of the
p192
aVBritish press corps in Afghanistan.
p193
aVIt was taken a couple of years ago by my friend David Gill.
p194
aVAccording to the Committee to Protect Journalists,
p195
aVsince 2010, there have been  thousands of journalists
p196
aVwho have been threatened, injured,
p197
aVkilled, detained.
p198
aVToo often, when we get this information,
p199
aVwe forget who it affects
p200
aVor how that information is given to us.
p201
aVWhat many journalists do,  both foreign and domestic,
p202
aVis very remarkable, especially in places like Afghanistan,
p203
aVand it's important that we never forget that,
p204
aVbecause what they're protecting
p205
aVis not only our right to receive that information
p206
aVbut also the freedom of the press, which is vital
p207
aVto a democratic society.
p208
aa(lp209
VMatt Rosenberg is a journalist in Afghanistan.
p210
aVHe works for The New York Times,
p211
aVand unfortunately, a few months ago
p212
aVhe wrote an article that displeased
p213
aVpeople in the government.
p214
aVAs a result, he was temporarily detained
p215
aVand he was illegally exiled out of the country.
p216
aVI represent Matt,
p217
aVand after dealing with the government,
p218
aVI was able to get legal acknowledgment
p219
aVthat in fact he was illegally exiled,
p220
aVand that freedom of the press does exist in Afghanistan,
p221
aVand there's consequences if that's not followed.
p222
aVAnd I'm happy to say that
p223
aVas of a few days ago,
p224
aVthe Afghan government
p225
aVformally invited him back into the country
p226
aVand they reversed their exile order of him.
p227
aa(lp228
V(Applause)
p229
aa(lp230
VIf you censor one journalist,  then it intimidates others,
p231
aVand soon nations are silenced.
p232
aVIt's important that we protect our journalists
p233
aVand freedom of the press,
p234
aVbecause that makes governments more accountable to us
p235
aVand more transparent.
p236
aVProtecting journalists and our right
p237
aVto receive information protects us.
p238
aa(lp239
VOur world is changing. We live in a different world now,
p240
aVand what were once individual problems
p241
aVare really now global problems for all of us.
p242
aVTwo weeks ago, Afghanistan had its first
p243
aVdemocratic transfer of power
p244
aVand elected president Ashraf Ghani, which is huge,
p245
aVand I'm very optimistic about him,
p246
aVand I'm hopeful that he'll give Afghanistan
p247
aVthe changes that it needs,
p248
aVespecially within the legal sector.
p249
aVWe live in a different world.
p250
aVWe live in a world where my  eight-year-old daughter
p251
aVonly knows a black president.
p252
aVThere's a great possibility that our next president
p253
aVwill be a woman,
p254
aVand as she gets older, she may question,
p255
aVcan a white guy be president?
p256
aV(Laughter)
p257
aV(Applause)
p258
aa(lp259
VOur world is changing, and  we need to change with it,
p260
aVand what were once individual problems
p261
aVare problems for all of us.
p262
aVAccording to UNICEF,
p263
aVthere are currently over 280 million
p264
aVboys and girls who are married
p265
aVunder the age of 15.
p266
aVTwo hundred and eighty million.
p267
aVChild marriages prolong the vicious cycle
p268
aVof poverty, poor health, lack of education.
p269
aa(lp270
VAt the age of 12, Sahar was married.
p271
aVShe was forced into this marriage
p272
aVand sold by her brother.
p273
aVWhen she went to her in-laws' house,
p274
aVthey forced her into prostitution.
p275
aVBecause she refused, she was tortured.
p276
aVShe was severely beaten with metal rods.
p277
aVThey burned her body.
p278
aVThey tied her up in a basement and starved her.
p279
aVThey used pliers to take out her fingernails.
p280
aVAt one point,
p281
aVshe managed to escape from this torture chamber
p282
aVto a neighbor's house,
p283
aVand when she went there, instead of protecting her,
p284
aVthey dragged her back
p285
aVto her husband's house,
p286
aVand she was tortured even worse.
p287
aa(lp288
VWhen I met first Sahar, thankfully,
p289
aVWomen for Afghan Women
p290
aVgave her a safe haven to go to.
p291
aVAs a lawyer, I try to be very strong
p292
aVfor all my clients,
p293
aVbecause that's very important to me,
p294
aVbut seeing her,
p295
aVhow broken and very weak as she was,
p296
aVwas very difficult.
p297
aVIt took weeks for us to really get to
p298
aVwhat happened to her
p299
aVwhen she was in that house,
p300
aVbut finally she started opening up to me,
p301
aVand when she opened up,
p302
aVwhat I heard was
p303
aVshe didn't know what her rights were,
p304
aVbut she did know she had  a certain level of protection
p305
aVby her government that failed her,
p306
aVand so we were able to talk about
p307
aVwhat her legal options were.
p308
aa(lp309
VAnd so we decided to take this case
p310
aVto the Supreme Court.
p311
aVNow, this is extremely significant,
p312
aVbecause this is the first time
p313
aVthat a victim of domestic violence in Afghanistan
p314
aVwas being represented by a lawyer,
p315
aVa law that's been on the  books for years and years,
p316
aVbut until Sahar, had never been used.
p317
aVIn addition to this, we also decided
p318
aVto sue for civil damages,
p319
aVagain using a law that's never been used,
p320
aVbut we used it for her case.
p321
aVSo there we were at the Supreme Court
p322
aVarguing in front of 12 Afghan justices,
p323
aVme as an American female lawyer,
p324
aVand Sahar, a young woman
p325
aVwho when I met her couldn't  speak above a whisper.
p326
aVShe stood up,
p327
aVshe found her voice,
p328
aVand my girl told them that she wanted justice,
p329
aVand she got it.
p330
aVAt the end of it all, the court unanimously agreed
p331
aVthat her in-laws should be arrested for what they did to her,
p332
aVher fucking brother should also be arrested
p333
aVfor selling her \u2014
p334
aV(Applause) \u2014
p335
aVand they agreed that she did have a right
p336
aVto civil compensation.
p337
aVWhat Sahar has shown us is that we can attack
p338
aVexisting bad practices by using the laws
p339
aVin the ways that they're intended to be used,
p340
aVand by protecting Sahar,
p341
aVwe are protecting ourselves.
p342
aa(lp343
VAfter having worked in Afghanistan
p344
aVfor over six years now,
p345
aVa lot of my family and friends think
p346
aVthat what I do looks like this.
p347
aV(Laughter)
p348
aVBut in all actuality, what I do looks like this.
p349
aVNow, we can all do something.
p350
aVI'm not saying we should all buy a plane ticket and go to Afghanistan,
p351
aVbut we can all be contributors
p352
aVto a global human rights economy.
p353
aVWe can create a culture of transparency
p354
aVand accountability to the laws,
p355
aVand make governments more accountable to us,
p356
aVas we are to them.
p357
aa(lp358
VA few months ago, a South African lawyer
p359
aVvisited me in my office
p360
aVand he said, "I wanted to meet you.
p361
aVI wanted to see what a crazy person looked like."
p362
aVThe laws are ours,
p363
aVand no matter what your ethnicity,
p364
aVnationality, gender, race,
p365
aVthey belong to us,
p366
aVand fighting for justice is not an act of insanity.
p367
aVBusinesses also need to get with the program.
p368
aVA corporate investment in human rights
p369
aVis a capital gain on your businesses,
p370
aVand whether you're a business, an NGO,
p371
aVor a private citizen, rule  of law benefits all of us.
p372
aVAnd by working together with a concerted mindset,
p373
aVthrough the people, public and private sector,
p374
aVwe can create a global human rights economy
p375
aVand all become global investors in human rights.
p376
aVAnd by doing this,
p377
aVwe can achieve justness together.
p378
