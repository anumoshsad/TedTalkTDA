VI'm a relationship builder.
p4
aVWhen you think of a relationship builder,
p5
aVdon't you just automatically think "architect?"
p6
aVProbably not.
p7
aVThat's because most people think architects design buildings and cities,
p8
aVbut what we really design are relationships,
p9
aVbecause cities are about people.
p10
aVThey're places where people come together for all kinds of exchange.
p11
aVAnd besides, skylines are highly specific urban habitats
p12
aVwith their own insects, plants and animals,
p13
aVand even their own weather.
p14
aa(lp15
VBut today, urban habitats are out of balance.
p16
aVClimate change, together with political and economic troubles,
p17
aVare having an impact;
p18
aVthey're adding up and stressing out cities and us,
p19
aVthe people who live in them.
p20
aa(lp21
VFor me, the field of ecology has provided important insight,
p22
aVbecause ecologists don't just look at individual species on their own,
p23
aVthey look at the relationships between living things
p24
aVand their environment.
p25
aVThey look at how all the diverse parts of the ecosystem are interconnected,
p26
aVand it's actually this balance, this web of life, that sustains life.
p27
aVMy team and I have been applying insights from ecology to architecture
p28
aVto see how physical space can help build stronger relationships.
p29
aVThe projects I'm going to show you today
p30
aVuse the idea of building relationships as the key driver for design.
p31
aa(lp32
VHere's an example of what I mean.
p33
aVRecently, we were asked to design a center for social justice leadership
p34
aVcalled the Arcus Center.
p35
aVThey asked us for a building that could break down traditional barriers
p36
aVbetween different groups
p37
aVand in doing so, create possibilities for meaningful conversations
p38
aVaround social justice.
p39
aVThe students wanted a place for cultural exchange.
p40
aVThey thought a place for preparing food together could do that.
p41
aVAnd they wanted to be welcoming to the outside community.
p42
aVThey thought a fireplace could draw people in
p43
aVand help start conversations.
p44
aVAnd everybody wanted the work of social justice to be visible
p45
aVto the outside world.
p46
aVThere really wasn't a precedent for this kind of space,
p47
aVso we looked around the globe and found examples
p48
aVof community meeting houses.
p49
aVCommunity meeting houses are places
p50
aVwhere there's very specific relationships between people,
p51
aVlike this one in Mali, where the elders gather.
p52
aVThe low roof keeps everybody seated and at equal eye level.
p53
aVIt's very egalitarian.
p54
aVI mean, you can't stand up and take over the meeting.
p55
aVYou'd actually bump your head.
p56
aa(lp57
V(Laughter)
p58
aa(lp59
VIn meeting houses, there's always a central space
p60
aVwhere you can sit around a circle and see each other.
p61
aVSo we designed a space just like that
p62
aVright in the middle of the Arcus Center,
p63
aVand we anchored it with a fireplace and a kitchen.
p64
aVIt's pretty hard to get a kitchen and a fireplace in a building like this
p65
aVwith the building codes,
p66
aVbut it was so important to the concept, we got it done.
p67
aVAnd now the central space works for big social gatherings
p68
aVand a place to meet one-on-one for the very first time.
p69
aVIt's almost like this three-way intersection
p70
aVthat encourages bumping into people and starting a conversation.
p71
aVNow you can always pass the kitchen and see something going on.
p72
aVYou can sit by the fireplace and share stories.
p73
aVYou can study together in big groups or in small ones,
p74
aVbecause the architecture sets up these opportunities.
p75
aa(lp76
VEven the construction is about building relationships.
p77
aVIt's made of cordwood masonry,
p78
aVwhich is using logs the way you would use bricks.
p79
aVIt's super low-tech and easy to do and anyone can do it \u2014
p80
aVand that's the entire point.
p81
aVThe act of making is a social activity.
p82
aa(lp83
VAnd it's good for the planet, too:
p84
aVthe trees absorbed carbon when they were growing up,
p85
aVand they gave off oxygen,
p86
aVand now that carbon is trapped inside the walls
p87
aVand it's not being released into the atmosphere.
p88
aVSo making the walls is equivalent to taking cars right off the road.
p89
aVWe chose the building method
p90
aVbecause it connects people to each other and to the environment.
p91
aa(lp92
VBut is it working?
p93
aVIs it creating relationships and nurturing them?
p94
aVHow can we know?
p95
aVWell, more and more people are coming here, for one,
p96
aVand as a result of the fireside chats
p97
aVand a full calendar of programming,
p98
aVpeople are applying for the Arcus Fellowships.
p99
aVIn fact, applications have increased tenfold for the Arcus Fellowship
p100
aVsince the building opened.
p101
aVIt's working. It's bringing people together.
p102
aa(lp103
VSo I've shown how architecture can connect people
p104
aVon this kind of horizontal campus scale.
p105
aVBut we wondered if social relationships could be scaled up \u2014
p106
aVor rather, upward \u2014 in tall buildings.
p107
aVTall buildings don't necessarily lend themselves to being social buildings.
p108
aVThey can seem isolating and inward.
p109
aVYou might only see people in those awkward elevator rides.
p110
aVBut in several major cities, I've been designing tall buildings
p111
aVthat are based on creating relationships between people.
p112
aa(lp113
VThis is Aqua.
p114
aVIt's a residential high-rise in Chicago
p115
aVaimed at young urban professionals and empty nesters,
p116
aVmany of them new to the city.
p117
aVWith over 700 apartments, we wanted to see if we could use architecture
p118
aVto help people get to know their neighbors,
p119
aVeven when their homes are organized in the vertical dimension.
p120
aVSo we invented a way to use balconies as the new social connectors.
p121
aVThe shapes of the floor slabs vary slightly and they transition
p122
aVas you go up the tower.
p123
aVThe result of this is that you can actually see people
p124
aVfrom your balcony.
p125
aVThe balconies are misregistered.
p126
aVYou can lean over your balcony and say, "Hey!"
p127
aVjust like you would across the backyard.
p128
aVTo make the balconies more comfortable
p129
aVfor a longer period of time during the year,
p130
aVwe studied the wind with digital simulations,
p131
aVso the effect of the balcony shapes breaks up the wind
p132
aVand confuses the wind
p133
aVand makes the balconies more comfortable and less windy.
p134
aa(lp135
VNow, just by being able to go outside on your balcony
p136
aVor on the third floor roof terrace,
p137
aVyou can be connected to the outdoors,
p138
aVeven when you're way above the ground plane.
p139
aVSo the building acts to create community
p140
aVwithin the building and the city at the same time.
p141
aVIt's working.
p142
aVAnd people are starting to meet each other on the building surface
p143
aVand we've heard \u2014
p144
aa(lp145
V(Laughter)
p146
aa(lp147
Vthey've even starting getting together as couples.
p148
aVBut besides romantic relationships,
p149
aVthe building has a positive social effect
p150
aVon the community,
p151
aVas evidenced by people starting groups together
p152
aVand starting big projects together,
p153
aVlike this organic community garden on the building's roof terrace.
p154
aa(lp155
VSo I've shown how tall buildings can be social connectors,
p156
aVbut what about public architecture?
p157
aVHow can we create better social cohesion in public buildings
p158
aVand civic spaces,
p159
aVand why is it important?
p160
aVPublic architecture is just not as successful
p161
aVif it comes from the top down.
p162
aa(lp163
VAbout 15 years ago in Chicago,
p164
aVthey started to replace old police stations,
p165
aVand they built this identical model all over the city.
p166
aVAnd even though they had good intentions
p167
aVof treating all neighborhoods equally,
p168
aVthe communities didn't feel invested in the process
p169
aVor feel a sense of ownership of these buildings.
p170
aVIt was equality in the sense that everybody gets the same police station,
p171
aVbut it wasn't equity in the sense of responding
p172
aVto each community's individual needs.
p173
aVAnd equity is the key issue here.
p174
aa(lp175
VYou know, in my field, there's a debate
p176
aVabout whether architecture can even do anything
p177
aVto improve social relationships.
p178
aVBut I believe that we need architecture and every tool in our tool kit
p179
aVto improve these relationships.
p180
aVIn the US, policy reforms have been recommended
p181
aVin order to rebuild trust.
p182
aVBut my team and I wondered
p183
aVif design and a more inclusive design process
p184
aVcould help add something positive to this policy conversation.
p185
aVWe asked ourselves simply:
p186
aVCan design help rebuild trust?
p187
aa(lp188
VSo we reached out to community members and police officers in North Lawndale;
p189
aVit's a neighborhood in Chicago
p190
aVwhere the police station is perceived as a scary fortress
p191
aVsurrounded by a parking lot.
p192
aVIn North Lawndale, people are afraid of police
p193
aVand of going anywhere near the police station,
p194
aVeven to report a crime.
p195
aVSo we organized this brainstorming session
p196
aVwith both groups participating,
p197
aVand we came up with this whole new idea for the police station.
p198
aVIt's called "Polis Station."
p199
aV"Polis" is a Greek word that means a place with a sense of community.
p200
aVIt's based on the idea
p201
aVthat if you can increase opportunities for positive social interactions
p202
aVbetween police and community members,
p203
aVyou can rebuild that relationship
p204
aVand activate the neighborhood at the same time.
p205
aa(lp206
VInstead of the police station as a scary fortress,
p207
aVyou get highly active spaces on the public side of the station \u2014
p208
aVplaces that spark conversation,
p209
aVlike a barbershop, a coffee shop
p210
aVor sports courts as well.
p211
aVBoth cops and kids said they love sports.
p212
aVThese insights came directly from the community members
p213
aVand the police officers themselves,
p214
aVand as designers, our role was just to connect the dots
p215
aVand suggest the first step.
p216
aVSo with the help of the city and the parks,
p217
aVwe were able to raise funds and design and build a half-court,
p218
aVright on the police station parking lot.
p219
aa(lp220
VIt's a start.
p221
aVBut is it rebuilding trust?
p222
aVThe people in North Lawndale say the kids are using the courts every day
p223
aVand they even organize tournaments like this one shown here,
p224
aVand once in a while an officer joins in.
p225
aVBut now, they even have basketballs inside the station
p226
aVthat kids can borrow.
p227
aVAnd recently they've asked us to expand the courts
p228
aVand build a park on the site.
p229
aVAnd parents report something astonishing.
p230
aVBefore, there was fear of going anywhere the station, and now they say
p231
aVthere's a sense that the court is safer than other courts nearby,
p232
aVand they prefer their kids to play here.
p233
aa(lp234
VSo maybe in the future,
p235
aVon the public side of the station,
p236
aVyou might be able to drop in for a haircut at the barbershop
p237
aVor reserve the community room for a birthday party
p238
aVor renew your driver's license
p239
aVor get money out of an ATM.
p240
aVIt can be a place for neighbors to meet each other
p241
aVand to get to know the officers, and vice versa.
p242
aVThis is not a utopian fantasy.
p243
aVIt's about how do you design to rebuild trust,
p244
aVtrusting relationships?
p245
aa(lp246
VYou know, every city has parks, libraries, schools
p247
aVand other public buildings
p248
aVthat have the potential to be reimagined as social connectors.
p249
aVBut reimagining the buildings for the future is going to require
p250
aVengaging the people who live there.
p251
aVEngaging the public can be intimidating, and I've felt that, too.
p252
aVBut maybe that's because in architecture school,
p253
aVwe don't really learn how to engage the public in the act of design.
p254
aVWe're taught to defend our design against criticism.
p255
aVBut I think that can change, too.
p256
aa(lp257
VSo if we can focus the design mind
p258
aVon creating positive, reinforcing relationships
p259
aVin architecture and through architecture,
p260
aVI believe we can do much more than create individual buildings.
p261
aVWe can reduce the stress and the polarization
p262
aVin our urban habitats.
p263
aVWe can create relationships.
p264
aVWe can help steady this planet we all share.
p265
aa(lp266
VSee?
p267
aVArchitects really are relationship builders.
p268
aa(lp269
