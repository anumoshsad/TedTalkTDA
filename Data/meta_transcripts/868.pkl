VToday, I want you to look at
p4
aVchildren who become suicide bombers
p5
aVthrough a completely different lens.
p6
aVIn 2009, there were 500
p7
aVbomb blasts across Pakistan.
p8
aVI spent the year working
p9
aVwith children
p10
aVwho were training to become suicide bombers
p11
aVand with Taliban recruiters,
p12
aVtrying to understand how the Taliban
p13
aVwere converting these children
p14
aVinto live ammunition
p15
aVand why these children were actively
p16
aVsigning up to their cause.
p17
aa(lp18
VI want you to watch a short video
p19
aVfrom my latest documentary film, "Children of the Taliban."
p20
aa(lp21
V(Singing)
p22
aa(lp23
VThe Taliban now run their own schools.
p24
aVThey target poor families
p25
aVand convince the parents to send their children.
p26
aVIn return, they provide free food and shelter
p27
aVand sometimes pay the families a monthly stipend.
p28
aVWe've obtained a propaganda video
p29
aVmade by the Taliban.
p30
aVYoung boys are taught justifications
p31
aVfor suicide attacks
p32
aVand the execution of spies.
p33
aa(lp34
VI made contact with a child from Swat
p35
aVwho studied in a madrassa like this.
p36
aVHazrat Ali is from a
p37
aVpoor farming family in Swat.
p38
aVHe joined the Taliban a year ago
p39
aVwhen he was 13.
p40
aa(lp41
VHow do the Taliban in your area get people to join them?
p42
aa(lp43
VHazrat Ali: They first call us to the mosque and preach to us.
p44
aVThen they take us to a madrassa
p45
aVand teach us things from the Koran.
p46
aa(lp47
VSharmeen Obaid Chinoy: He tells me that children
p48
aVare then given months of military training.
p49
aa(lp50
VHA: They teach us to use machine guns, Kalashnikov,
p51
aVrocket launchers, grenades, bombs.
p52
aVThey ask us to use them only against the infidels.
p53
aVThen they teach us to do a suicide attack.
p54
aa(lp55
VSOC: Would you like to carry out a suicide attack?
p56
aa(lp57
VHA: If God gives me strength.
p58
aa(lp59
VSOC: I, in my research,
p60
aVhave seen that the Taliban have perfected
p61
aVthe way in which they recruit
p62
aVand train children,
p63
aVand I think it's a five-step process.
p64
aVStep one is that the Taliban prey
p65
aVon families that are large, that are poor,
p66
aVthat live in rural areas.
p67
aVThey separate the parents from the children
p68
aVby promising to provide food, clothing,
p69
aVshelter to these children.
p70
aVThen they ship them off, hundreds of miles away
p71
aVto hard-line schools
p72
aVthat run along the Taliban agenda.
p73
aa(lp74
VStep two:
p75
aVThey teach the children the Koran, which is Islam's holiest book,
p76
aVin Arabic, a language these children do not understand
p77
aVand cannot speak.
p78
aVThey rely very heavily on teachers,
p79
aVwho I have personally seen
p80
aVdistort the message to these children
p81
aVas and when it suits their purpose to.
p82
aVThese children are explicitly forbidden
p83
aVfrom reading newspapers, listening to radio,
p84
aVreading any books
p85
aVthat the teachers do not prescribe them.
p86
aVIf any child is found violating these rules,
p87
aVhe is severely reprimanded.
p88
aVEffectively, the Taliban create
p89
aVa complete blackout
p90
aVof any other source of information for these children.
p91
aa(lp92
VStep three: The Taliban want these children
p93
aVto hate the world that they currently live in.
p94
aVSo they beat these children \u2014
p95
aVI have seen it;
p96
aVthey feed them twice a day dried bread and water;
p97
aVthey rarely allow them to play games;
p98
aVthey tell them that, for eight hours at a time,
p99
aVall they have to do is read the Koran.
p100
aVThe children are virtual prisoners;
p101
aVthey cannot leave, they cannot go home.
p102
aVTheir parents are so poor,
p103
aVthey have no resources to get them back.
p104
aa(lp105
VStep four: The older members of the Taliban,
p106
aVthe fighters,
p107
aVstart talking to the younger boys
p108
aVabout the glories of martyrdom.
p109
aVThey talk to them about how when they die,
p110
aVthey will be received up
p111
aVwith lakes of honey and milk,
p112
aVhow there will be 72 virgins
p113
aVwaiting for them in paradise,
p114
aVhow there will be unlimited food,
p115
aVand how this glory
p116
aVis going to propel them to become
p117
aVheroes in their neighborhoods.
p118
aVEffectively, this is the brainwashing process
p119
aVthat has begun.
p120
aa(lp121
VStep five: I believe the Taliban have
p122
aVone of the most effective
p123
aVmeans of propaganda.
p124
aVTheir videos that they use
p125
aVare intercut with photographs
p126
aVof men and women and children
p127
aVdying in Iraq and Afghanistan
p128
aVand in Pakistan.
p129
aVAnd the basic message is that the Western powers
p130
aVdo not care about civilian deaths,
p131
aVso those people who live
p132
aVin areas and support governments
p133
aVthat work with Western powers are fair game.
p134
aVThat's why Pakistani civilians,
p135
aVover 6,000 of whom have been killed in the last two years alone,
p136
aVare fair game.
p137
aVNow these children are primed
p138
aVto become suicide bombers.
p139
aVThey're ready to go out and fight
p140
aVbecause they've been told that this is
p141
aVeffectively their only way
p142
aVto glorify Islam.
p143
aa(lp144
VI want you to watch another excerpt from the film.
p145
aa(lp146
VThis boy is called Zenola.
p147
aVHe blew himself up, killing six.
p148
aVThis boy is called Sadik.
p149
aVHe killed 22.
p150
aVThis boy is called Messoud.
p151
aVHe killed 28.
p152
aVThe Taliban are running suicide schools,
p153
aVpreparing a generation of boys
p154
aVfor atrocities against civilians.
p155
aa(lp156
VDo you want to carry out a suicide attack?
p157
aa(lp158
VBoy: I would love to.
p159
aVBut only if I get permission from my dad.
p160
aVWhen I look at suicide bombers younger than me, or my age,
p161
aVI get so inspired by their terrific attacks.
p162
aa(lp163
VSOC: What blessing would you get
p164
aVfrom carrying out a suicide attack?
p165
aa(lp166
VBoy: On the day of judgment, God will ask me,
p167
aV"Why did you do that?"
p168
aVI will answer, "My Lord! Only to make you happy!
p169
aVI have laid down my life fighting the infidels."
p170
aVThen God will look at my intention.
p171
aVIf my intention was to eradicate evil for Islam,
p172
aVthen I will be rewarded with paradise.
p173
aa(lp174
VSinger: \u266b On the day of judgment \u266b
p175
aV\u266b My God will call me \u266b
p176
aV\u266b My body will be put back together \u266b
p177
aV\u266b And God will ask me why I did this \u266b
p178
aa(lp179
VSOC: I leave you all with this thought:
p180
aVIf you grew up in these circumstances,
p181
aVfaced with these choices,
p182
aVwould you choose to live in this world
p183
aVor in the glorious afterlife?
p184
aVAs one Taliban recruiter told me,
p185
aV"There will always be sacrificial lambs in this war."
p186
aa(lp187
VThank you.
