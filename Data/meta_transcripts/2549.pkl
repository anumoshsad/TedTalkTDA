VImagine that you are a product designer.
p4
aVAnd you've designed a product,
p5
aVa new type of product, called the human immune system.
p6
aVYou're pitching this product
p7
aVto a skeptical, strictly no-nonsense manager.
p8
aVLet's call him Bob.
p9
aVI think we all know at least one Bob, right?
p10
aVHow would that go?
p11
aa(lp12
VBob, I've got this incredible idea
p13
aVfor a completely new type of personal health product.
p14
aVIt's called the human immune system.
p15
aVI can see from your face that you're having some problems with this.
p16
aVDon't worry. I know it's very complicated.
p17
aVI don't want to take you through the gory details,
p18
aVI just want to tell you about some of the amazing features of this product.
p19
aVFirst of all, it cleverly uses redundancy
p20
aVby having millions of copies of each component \u2014
p21
aVleukocytes, white blood cells \u2014
p22
aVbefore they're actually needed,
p23
aVto create a massive buffer against the unexpected.
p24
aVAnd it cleverly leverages diversity
p25
aVby having not just leukocytes but B cells, T cells,
p26
aVnatural killer cells, antibodies.
p27
aVThe components don't really matter.
p28
aVThe point is that together,
p29
aVthis diversity of different approaches can cope with more or less anything
p30
aVthat evolution has been able to throw up.
p31
aVAnd the design is completely modular.
p32
aVYou have the surface barrier of the human skin,
p33
aVyou have the very rapidly reacting innate immune system
p34
aVand then you have the highly targeted adaptive immune system.
p35
aVThe point is, that if one system fails, another can take over,
p36
aVcreating a virtually foolproof system.
p37
aa(lp38
VI can see I'm losing you, Bob, but stay with me,
p39
aVbecause here is the really killer feature.
p40
aVThe product is completely adaptive.
p41
aVIt's able to actually develop targeted antibodies
p42
aVto threats that it's never even met before.
p43
aVIt actually also does this with incredible prudence,
p44
aVdetecting and reacting to every tiny threat,
p45
aVand furthermore, remembering every previous threat,
p46
aVin case they are ever encountered again.
p47
aVWhat I'm pitching you today is actually not a stand-alone product.
p48
aVThe product is embedded in the larger system of the human body,
p49
aVand it works in complete harmony with that system,
p50
aVto create this unprecedented level of biological protection.
p51
aVSo Bob, just tell me honestly, what do you think of my product?
p52
aa(lp53
VAnd Bob may say something like,
p54
aVI sincerely appreciate the effort and passion
p55
aVthat have gone into your presentation,
p56
aVblah blah blah \u2014
p57
aa(lp58
V(Laughter)
p59
aa(lp60
VBut honestly, it's total nonsense.
p61
aVYou seem to be saying that the key selling points of your product
p62
aVare that it is inefficient and complex.
p63
aVDidn't they teach you 80-20?
p64
aVAnd furthermore, you're saying that this product is siloed.
p65
aVIt overreacts,
p66
aVmakes things up as it goes along
p67
aVand is actually designed for somebody else's benefit.
p68
aVI'm sorry to break it to you, but I don't think this one is a winner.
p69
aa(lp70
VIf we went with Bob's philosophy,
p71
aVI think we'd actually end up with a more efficient immune system.
p72
aVAnd efficiency is always important in the short term.
p73
aVLess complex, more efficient, more bang for the buck.
p74
aVWho could say no to that?
p75
aVUnfortunately, there's one very tiny problem,
p76
aVand that is that the user of this product, you or I,
p77
aVwould probably die within one week of the next winter,
p78
aVwhen we encountered a new strain of the influenza virus.
p79
aa(lp80
VI first became interested in biology and business,
p81
aVand longevity and resilience,
p82
aVwhen I was asked a very unusual question
p83
aVby the CEO of a global tech company.
p84
aVAnd the question was:
p85
aVWhat do we have to do to make sure that our company lasts 100 years?
p86
aVA seemingly innocent question,
p87
aVbut actually, it's a little trickier than you might think,
p88
aVconsidering that the average US public company now
p89
aVcan expect a life span of only 30 years.
p90
aVThat is less than half of the life span
p91
aVthat its employees can expect to enjoy.
p92
aa(lp93
VNow, if you were the CEO of such a company,
p94
aVbadgered by investors and buffeted by change,
p95
aVwe might forgive you for not even worrying too much
p96
aVabout what happens 30 years out.
p97
aVBut here's something that should keep you awake at night:
p98
aVthe probability that your company will not be around in five year's time,
p99
aVon average, is now a staggering 32 percent.
p100
aVThat's a one in three chance that your company will be taken over
p101
aVor will fail within just five years.
p102
aa(lp103
VLet's come back to our tech CEO's question.
p104
aVWhere better to turn for advice than nature,
p105
aVthat's been in the business of life and death
p106
aVfor longer than any company?
p107
aVAs a lapsed biologist,
p108
aVI decided to immediately call a real biologist,
p109
aVmy friend Simon Levin,
p110
aVProfessor of Biology and Mathematics at Princeton University.
p111
aVTogether, we looked at a variety of biological systems,
p112
aVranging from natural tropical rainforests
p113
aVthrough to managed forests and fisheries.
p114
aVAnd we asked ourselves the question:
p115
aVWhat makes these systems resilient and enduring?
p116
aa(lp117
VAnd what we found was that the same six principles
p118
aVthat we saw underpinning the miracle of the human immune system
p119
aVactually cropped up again and again,
p120
aVfrom redundancy through to embeddedness.
p121
aVIn fact, we saw these principles not only in biologically enduring systems,
p122
aVwe also found them being very characteristic
p123
aVof long-lived social systems,
p124
aVlike the Roman Empire and the Catholic Church,
p125
aVbelieve it or not.
p126
aVWe also went on to look at business,
p127
aVand found that these very same properties also characterized businesses
p128
aVthat were resilient and long-lived,
p129
aVand we noted their absence from ones which were short-lived.
p130
aa(lp131
VLet's first take a look at what happens when the corporate immune system
p132
aVcollapses.
p133
aVThis beautiful building is part of the Shitennoji Temple Complex
p134
aVin Osaka, Japan.
p135
aVIn fact, it's one of the oldest temples in Japan.
p136
aVIt was built by a Korean artisan,
p137
aVbecause at the time, Japan was not yet building temples.
p138
aVAnd this Korean artisan went on to found a temple-building company.
p139
aVAmazingly, his company, Kong\u014d Gumi,
p140
aVwas still around 1,428 years later.
p141
aVIn fact, it became the oldest continuously operating company
p142
aVin the world.
p143
aa(lp144
VSo how is Kong\u014d Gumi doing today?
p145
aVNot too well, I'm afraid.
p146
aVIt borrowed very heavily
p147
aVduring the bubble period of the Japanese economy,
p148
aVto invest in real estate.
p149
aVAnd when the bubble burst, it couldn't refinance its loans.
p150
aVThe company failed,
p151
aVand it was taken over by a major construction company.
p152
aVTragically, after 40 generations of very careful stewardship
p153
aVby the Kong\u014d family,
p154
aVKong\u014d Gumi succumbed to a spectacular lapse
p155
aVin the ability to apply a principle of prudence.
p156
aa(lp157
VSpeaking of company failures:
p158
aVwe're all familiar with the failure of Kodak,
p159
aVthe company that declared bankruptcy
p160
aVin January 2012.
p161
aVMuch more interesting, however, is the question:
p162
aVWhy did Fujifilm \u2014
p163
aVsame product, same pressures from digital technology, same time \u2014
p164
aVwhy was Fujifilm able to survive and flourish?
p165
aa(lp166
VFujifilm used its capabilities in chemistry, material science and optics
p167
aVto diversify into a number of areas,
p168
aVranging from cosmetics to pharmaceuticals,
p169
aVto medical systems to biomaterials.
p170
aVSome of these diversification attempts failed.
p171
aVBut in aggregate,
p172
aVit was able to adapt its portfolio sufficiently
p173
aVto survive and flourish.
p174
aVAs the CEO, Mr. Komori, put it,
p175
aVthe strategy succeeded because it had "more pockets and drawers"
p176
aVthan the rivals.
p177
aVHe meant, of course,
p178
aVthat they were able to create more options than the rivals.
p179
aVFujifilm survived because it applied the principles of prudence,
p180
aVdiversity
p181
aVand adaptation.
p182
aa(lp183
VA catastrophic factory fire, like the one we see here,
p184
aVcompletely wiped out, in one evening,
p185
aVthe only plant which supplied Toyota with valves for car-braking systems.
p186
aVThe ultimate test of resilience.
p187
aVCar production ground to a screeching halt.
p188
aVHow was it, then, that Toyota was able to recover car production?
p189
aVCan you imagine how long it took?
p190
aVJust five days.
p191
aVFrom having no braking valves to complete recovery in five days.
p192
aVHow was this possible?
p193
aVToyota managed its network of suppliers in such a collaborative manner
p194
aVthat it could work very quickly and smoothly with suppliers
p195
aVto repurpose production,
p196
aVfill the missing braking valve capacity
p197
aVand have car production come online again.
p198
aVToyota applied the principles of modularity of its supply network,
p199
aVembeddedness in an integrated system
p200
aVand the functional redundancy to be able to repurpose, smoothly,
p201
aVexisting capacity.
p202
aa(lp203
VNow fortunately, few companies succumb to catastrophic fires.
p204
aVBut we do read in the newspaper every day about companies
p205
aVsuccumbing to the disruption of technology.
p206
aVHow is it, then, that the consumer optics giant Essilor
p207
aVis able to avoid technology disruption, and even profit from it?
p208
aVAnd yes, technology disruption is not only a big deal
p209
aVin software and electronics.
p210
aVEssilor carefully scans the competitive environment
p211
aVfor potentially disruptive technologies.
p212
aVIt acquires those technologies very early,
p213
aVbefore they've become expensive or competitors have mobilized around them,
p214
aVand it then develops those technologies itself,
p215
aVeven at the risk of failure
p216
aVor the risk of self-disruption.
p217
aVEssilor stays ahead of its game,
p218
aVand has delivered spectacular performance
p219
aVfor over 40 years,
p220
aVby using the principles of prudence and adaptation.
p221
aa(lp222
VOK, if these principles are so powerful, you might be thinking,
p223
aVwhy are they not commonplace in business?
p224
aVWhy do we not use these words every day?
p225
aVWell, change has to first start in the mind.
p226
aVIf we think back to our pitch to Bob,
p227
aVin order to apply the principles
p228
aVthat underpin the miracle of the human immune system,
p229
aVwe first need to think differently
p230
aVabout business.
p231
aVNow typically, when we think about business,
p232
aVwe use what I call "mechanical thinking."
p233
aVWe set goals,
p234
aVwe analyze problems,
p235
aVwe construct and we adhere to plans,
p236
aVand more than anything else,
p237
aVwe stress efficiency and short-term performance.
p238
aVNow, don't get me wrong \u2014
p239
aVthis is a splendidly practical and effective way
p240
aVof addressing relatively simple challenges
p241
aVin relatively stable environments.
p242
aVIt's the way that Bob \u2014 and probably many of us, myself included \u2014
p243
aVprocess most business problems we're faced with every day.
p244
aVIn fact, it was a pretty good mental model for business \u2014
p245
aVoverall \u2014
p246
aVuntil about the mid-1980s,
p247
aVwhen the conjunction of globalization
p248
aVand a revolution in technology and telecommunications
p249
aVmade business far more dynamic and unpredictable.
p250
aa(lp251
VBut what about those more dynamic and unpredictable situations
p252
aVthat we now increasingly face?
p253
aVI think in addition to the mechanical thinking,
p254
aVwe now need to master the art of biological thinking,
p255
aVas embodied by our six principles.
p256
aVIn other words, we need to think more modestly and subtly
p257
aVabout when and how
p258
aVwe can shape, rather than control,
p259
aVunpredictable and complex situations.
p260
aVIt's a little like the difference between throwing a ball
p261
aVand releasing a bird.
p262
aVThe ball would head in a straight line,
p263
aVprobably towards the intended target,
p264
aVand the bird certainly would not.
p265
aa(lp266
VSo what do you think?
p267
aVSounds a little impractical, a little theoretical, perhaps?
p268
aVNot at all.
p269
aVEvery small entrepreneurial company
p270
aVnaturally thinks and acts biologically.
p271
aVWhy?
p272
aVBecause it lacks the resources to shape its environment
p273
aVthrough brute force.
p274
aVIt lacks the scale to buffer change,
p275
aVand it's constantly thinking about the tough odds
p276
aVfor a start-up to survive.
p277
aVNow, the irony is, of course,
p278
aVthat every large company started off as a small, entrepreneurial company.
p279
aVBut along the way somewhere,
p280
aVmany have lost this ability to think and act biologically.
p281
aVThey need to rejuvenate their ability to think biologically
p282
aVin order to survive and thrive in today's environment.
p283
aa(lp284
VSo let's not just think about short-term performance.
p285
aVEvery company I know spends plenty of time
p286
aVthinking about the central question of strategy:
p287
aVHow good is our competitive game?
p288
aVIn addition, let's also consider
p289
aVthe second, more biological and equally important question:
p290
aVHow long will that game last?
p291
aa(lp292
VThank you very much.
