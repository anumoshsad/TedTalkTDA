(lp3
VThank you very much.
p4
aa(lp5
VI moved to America 12 years ago with my wife Terry and our two kids.
p6
aVActually, truthfully, we moved to Los Angeles \u2014
p7
aa(lp8
V(Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
Vthinking we were moving to America, but anyway \u2014
p11
aa(lp12
V(Laughter)
p13
aa(lp14
VIt's a short plane ride from Los Angeles to America.
p15
aa(lp16
V(Laughter)
p17
aa(lp18
VI got here 12 years ago,
p19
aVand when I got here, I was told various things,
p20
aVlike, "Americans don't get irony."
p21
aa(lp22
V(Laughter)
p23
aa(lp24
VHave you come across this idea?
p25
aVIt's not true.
p26
aVI've traveled the whole length and breadth of this country.
p27
aVI have found no evidence that Americans don't get irony.
p28
aVIt's one of those cultural myths,
p29
aVlike, "The British are reserved."
p30
aa(lp31
V(Laughter)
p32
aa(lp33
VI don't know why people think this.
p34
aVWe've invaded every country we've encountered.
p35
aa(lp36
V(Laughter)
p37
aa(lp38
VBut it's not true Americans don't get irony,
p39
aVbut I just want you to know that that's what people
p40
aVare saying about you behind your back.
p41
aVYou know, so when you leave living rooms in Europe,
p42
aVpeople say, thankfully, nobody was ironic in your presence.
p43
aa(lp44
V(Laughter)
p45
aa(lp46
VBut I knew that Americans get irony
p47
aVwhen I came across that legislation, "No Child Left Behind."
p48
aa(lp49
V(Laughter)
p50
aa(lp51
VBecause whoever thought of that title gets irony.
p52
aa(lp53
V(Laughter)
p54
aa(lp55
VDon't they?
p56
aa(lp57
V(Applause)
p58
aa(lp59
VBecause it's leaving millions of children behind.
p60
aVNow I can see that's not a very attractive name for legislation:
p61
aV"Millions of Children Left Behind."
p62
aVI can see that.
p63
aVWhat's the plan?
p64
aVWe propose to leave millions of children behind,
p65
aVand here's how it's going to work.
p66
aa(lp67
VAnd it's working beautifully.
p68
aa(lp69
V(Laughter)
p70
aa(lp71
VIn some parts of the country,
p72
aV60 percent of kids drop out of high school.
p73
aVIn the Native American communities,
p74
aVit's 80 percent of kids.
p75
aVIf we halved that number,
p76
aVone estimate is it would create a net gain to the U.S. economy
p77
aVover 10 years, of nearly a trillion dollars.
p78
aVFrom an economic point of view,
p79
aVthis is good math, isn't it, that we should do this?
p80
aVIt actually costs an enormous amount
p81
aVto mop up the damage from the dropout crisis.
p82
aa(lp83
VBut the dropout crisis is just the tip of an iceberg.
p84
aVWhat it doesn't count are all the kids who are in school
p85
aVbut being disengaged from it, who don't enjoy it,
p86
aVwho don't get any real benefit from it.
p87
aa(lp88
VAnd the reason is not that we're not spending enough money.
p89
aVAmerica spends more money on education than most other countries.
p90
aVClass sizes are smaller than in many countries.
p91
aVAnd there are hundreds of initiatives every year
p92
aVto try and improve education.
p93
aVThe trouble is, it's all going in the wrong direction.
p94
aVThere are three principles on which human life flourishes,
p95
aVand they are contradicted by the culture of education
p96
aVunder which most teachers have to labor
p97
aVand most students have to endure.
p98
aa(lp99
VThe first is this, that human beings are naturally different and diverse.
p100
aVCan I ask you, how many of you have got children of your own?
p101
aVOkay. Or grandchildren.
p102
aVHow about two children or more? Right.
p103
aVAnd the rest of you have seen such children.
p104
aa(lp105
V(Laughter)
p106
aa(lp107
VSmall people wandering about.
p108
aa(lp109
V(Laughter)
p110
aa(lp111
VI will make you a bet,
p112
aVand I am confident that I will win the bet.
p113
aVIf you've got two children or more,
p114
aVI bet you they are completely different from each other.
p115
aVAren't they?
p116
aa(lp117
V(Applause)
p118
aa(lp119
VYou would never confuse them, would you?
p120
aVLike, "Which one are you? Remind me."
p121
aa(lp122
V(Laughter)
p123
aa(lp124
V"Your mother and I need some color-coding system
p125
aVso we don't get confused."
p126
aa(lp127
VEducation under "No Child Left Behind"
p128
aVis based on not diversity but conformity.
p129
aVWhat schools are encouraged to do is to find out
p130
aVwhat kids can do across a very narrow spectrum of achievement.
p131
aVOne of the effects of "No Child Left Behind"
p132
aVhas been to narrow the focus onto the so-called STEM disciplines.
p133
aVThey're very important.
p134
aVI'm not here to argue against science and math.
p135
aVOn the contrary, they're necessary but they're not sufficient.
p136
aVA real education has to give equal weight
p137
aVto the arts, the humanities, to physical education.
p138
aVAn awful lot of kids, sorry, thank you \u2014
p139
aa(lp140
V(Applause)
p141
aa(lp142
VOne estimate in America currently is that something like 10 percent of kids,
p143
aVgetting on that way,
p144
aVare being diagnosed with various conditions
p145
aVunder the broad title of attention deficit disorder.
p146
aVADHD.
p147
aVI'm not saying there's no such thing.
p148
aVI just don't believe it's an epidemic like this.
p149
aVIf you sit kids down, hour after hour,
p150
aVdoing low-grade clerical work,
p151
aVdon't be surprised if they start to fidget, you know?
p152
aa(lp153
V(Laughter)
p154
aa(lp155
V(Applause)
p156
aa(lp157
VChildren are not, for the most part, suffering from a psychological condition.
p158
aVThey're suffering from childhood.
p159
aa(lp160
V(Laughter)
p161
aa(lp162
VAnd I know this because I spent my early life as a child.
p163
aVI went through the whole thing.
p164
aVKids prosper best with a broad curriculum that celebrates their various talents,
p165
aVnot just a small range of them.
p166
aVAnd by the way, the arts aren't just important
p167
aVbecause they improve math scores.
p168
aVThey're important because they speak to parts of children's being
p169
aVwhich are otherwise untouched.
p170
aa(lp171
VThe second, thank you \u2014
p172
aa(lp173
V(Applause)
p174
aa(lp175
VThe second principle that drives human life flourishing
p176
aVis curiosity.
p177
aVIf you can light the spark of curiosity in a child,
p178
aVthey will learn without any further assistance, very often.
p179
aVChildren are natural learners.
p180
aVIt's a real achievement to put that particular ability out,
p181
aVor to stifle it.
p182
aVCuriosity is the engine of achievement.
p183
aVNow the reason I say this
p184
aVis because one of the effects of the current culture here,
p185
aVif I can say so,
p186
aVhas been to de-professionalize teachers.
p187
aVThere is no system in the world or any school in the country
p188
aVthat is better than its teachers.
p189
aVTeachers are the lifeblood of the success of schools.
p190
aVBut teaching is a creative profession.
p191
aVTeaching, properly conceived, is not a delivery system.
p192
aVYou know, you're not there just to pass on received information.
p193
aVGreat teachers do that,
p194
aVbut what great teachers also do is mentor,
p195
aVstimulate, provoke, engage.
p196
aVYou see, in the end, education is about learning.
p197
aVIf there's no learning going on, there's no education going on.
p198
aVAnd people can spend an awful lot of time
p199
aVdiscussing education without ever discussing learning.
p200
aVThe whole point of education is to get people to learn.
p201
aa(lp202
VAn old friend of mine \u2014 actually very old, he's dead.
p203
aa(lp204
V(Laughter)
p205
aa(lp206
VThat's as old as it gets, I'm afraid.
p207
aa(lp208
V(Laughter)
p209
aa(lp210
VBut a wonderful guy he was, wonderful philosopher.
p211
aVHe used to talk about the difference
p212
aVbetween the task and achievement senses of verbs.
p213
aVYou can be engaged in the activity of something,
p214
aVbut not really be achieving it, like dieting.
p215
aa(lp216
V(Laughter)
p217
aa(lp218
VIt's a very good example.
p219
aVThere he is. He's dieting.
p220
aVIs he losing any weight? Not really.
p221
aa(lp222
V(Laughter)
p223
aa(lp224
VTeaching is a word like that.
p225
aVYou can say, "There's Deborah, she's in room 34, she's teaching."
p226
aVBut if nobody's learning anything,
p227
aVshe may be engaged in the task of teaching but not actually fulfilling it.
p228
aa(lp229
VThe role of a teacher is to facilitate learning.
p230
aVThat's it.
p231
aVAnd part of the problem is, I think,
p232
aVthat the dominant culture of education has come to focus
p233
aVon not teaching and learning, but testing.
p234
aVNow, testing is important.
p235
aVStandardized tests have a place.
p236
aVBut they should not be the dominant culture of education.
p237
aVThey should be diagnostic. They should help.
p238
aa(lp239
V(Applause)
p240
aa(lp241
VIf I go for a medical examination, I want some standardized tests.
p242
aVI do.
p243
aVI want to know what my cholesterol level is
p244
aVcompared to everybody else's on a standard scale.
p245
aVI don't want to be told on some scale my doctor invented in the car.
p246
aa(lp247
V(Laughter)
p248
aa(lp249
V"Your cholesterol is what I call Level Orange."
p250
aa(lp251
V"Really?"
p252
aa(lp253
V(Laughter)
p254
aa(lp255
V"Is that good?" "We don't know."
p256
aa(lp257
V(Laughter)
p258
aa(lp259
VBut all that should support learning.
p260
aVIt shouldn't obstruct it, which of course it often does.
p261
aVSo in place of curiosity, what we have is a culture of compliance.
p262
aVOur children and teachers are encouraged to follow routine algorithms
p263
aVrather than to excite that power of imagination and curiosity.
p264
aVAnd the third principle is this: that human life is inherently creative.
p265
aVIt's why we all have different résumés.
p266
aVWe create our lives,
p267
aVand we can recreate them as we go through them.
p268
aVIt's the common currency of being a human being.
p269
aVIt's why human culture is so interesting and diverse and dynamic.
p270
aVI mean, other animals may well have imaginations and creativity,
p271
aVbut it's not so much in evidence, is it, as ours?
p272
aVI mean, you may have a dog.
p273
aVAnd your dog may get depressed.
p274
aVYou know, but it doesn't listen to Radiohead, does it?
p275
aa(lp276
V(Laughter)
p277
aa(lp278
VAnd sit staring out the window with a bottle of Jack Daniels.
p279
aa(lp280
V(Laughter)
p281
aa(lp282
V"Would you like to come for a walk?"
p283
aV"No, I'm fine."
p284
aa(lp285
V(Laughter)
p286
aa(lp287
V"You go. I'll wait. But take pictures."
p288
aa(lp289
V(Laughter)
p290
aa(lp291
VWe all create our own lives through this restless process
p292
aVof imagining alternatives and possibilities,
p293
aVand one of the roles of education
p294
aVis to awaken and develop these powers of creativity.
p295
aVInstead, what we have is a culture of standardization.
p296
aa(lp297
VNow, it doesn't have to be that way.
p298
aVIt really doesn't.
p299
aVFinland regularly comes out on top in math, science and reading.
p300
aVNow, we only know that's what they do well at,
p301
aVbecause that's all that's being tested.
p302
aVThat's one of the problems of the test.
p303
aVThey don't look for other things that matter just as much.
p304
aVThe thing about work in Finland is this:
p305
aVthey don't obsess about those disciplines.
p306
aVThey have a very broad approach to education,
p307
aVwhich includes humanities, physical education, the arts.
p308
aa(lp309
VSecond, there is no standardized testing in Finland.
p310
aVI mean, there's a bit,
p311
aVbut it's not what gets people up in the morning,
p312
aVwhat keeps them at their desks.
p313
aa(lp314
VThe third thing \u2014 and I was at a meeting recently
p315
aVwith some people from Finland, actual Finnish people,
p316
aVand somebody from the American system was saying to the people in Finland,
p317
aV"What do you do about the drop-out rate in Finland?"
p318
aa(lp319
VAnd they all looked a bit bemused, and said,
p320
aV"Well, we don't have one.
p321
aVWhy would you drop out?
p322
aVIf people are in trouble, we get to them quite quickly
p323
aVand we help and support them."
p324
aa(lp325
VNow people always say,
p326
aV"Well, you know, you can't compare Finland to America."
p327
aVNo. I think there's a population of around five million in Finland.
p328
aVBut you can compare it to a state in America.
p329
aVMany states in America have fewer people in them than that.
p330
aVI mean, I've been to some states in America
p331
aVand I was the only person there.
p332
aa(lp333
V(Laughter)
p334
aa(lp335
VReally. Really.
p336
aVI was asked to lock up when I left.
p337
aa(lp338
V(Laughter)
p339
aa(lp340
VBut what all the high-performing systems in the world do
p341
aVis currently what is not evident, sadly,
p342
aVacross the systems in America \u2014
p343
aVI mean, as a whole.
p344
aVOne is this:
p345
aVthey individualize teaching and learning.
p346
aVThey recognize that it's students who are learning
p347
aVand the system has to engage them,
p348
aVtheir curiosity, their individuality, and their creativity.
p349
aVThat's how you get them to learn.
p350
aa(lp351
VThe second is that they attribute a very high status
p352
aVto the teaching profession.
p353
aVThey recognize that you can't improve education
p354
aVif you don't pick great people to teach and keep giving them
p355
aVconstant support and professional development.
p356
aVInvesting in professional development is not a cost.
p357
aVIt's an investment,
p358
aVand every other country that's succeeding well knows that,
p359
aVwhether it's Australia, Canada,
p360
aVSouth Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong or Shanghai.
p361
aVThey know that to be the case.
p362
aa(lp363
VAnd the third is,
p364
aVthey devolve responsibility to the school level
p365
aVfor getting the job done.
p366
aVYou see, there's a big difference here
p367
aVbetween going into a mode of command and control in education \u2014
p368
aVThat's what happens in some systems.
p369
aVCentral or state governments decide,
p370
aVthey know best and they're going to tell you what to do.
p371
aVThe trouble is that education doesn't go on
p372
aVin the committee rooms of our legislative buildings.
p373
aVIt happens in classrooms and schools,
p374
aVand the people who do it are the teachers and the students,
p375
aVand if you remove their discretion, it stops working.
p376
aVYou have to put it back to the people.
p377
aa(lp378
V(Applause)
p379
aa(lp380
VThere is wonderful work happening in this country.
p381
aVBut I have to say it's happening
p382
aVin spite of the dominant culture of education,
p383
aVnot because of it.
p384
aVIt's like people are sailing into a headwind all the time.
p385
aVAnd the reason I think is this:
p386
aVthat many of the current policies
p387
aVare based on mechanistic conceptions of education.
p388
aVIt's like education is an industrial process
p389
aVthat can be improved just by having better data,
p390
aVand somewhere in the back of the mind of some policy makers
p391
aVis this idea that if we fine-tune it well enough, if we just get it right,
p392
aVit will all hum along perfectly into the future.
p393
aVIt won't, and it never did.
p394
aa(lp395
VThe point is that education is not a mechanical system.
p396
aVIt's a human system.
p397
aVIt's about people,
p398
aVpeople who either do want to learn or don't want to learn.
p399
aVEvery student who drops out of school has a reason for it
p400
aVwhich is rooted in their own biography.
p401
aVThey may find it boring.
p402
aVThey may find it irrelevant.
p403
aVThey may find that it's at odds with the life they're living outside of school.
p404
aVThere are trends, but the stories are always unique.
p405
aVI was at a meeting recently in Los Angeles of \u2014
p406
aVthey're called alternative education programs.
p407
aVThese are programs designed to get kids back into education.
p408
aVThey have certain common features.
p409
aVThey're very personalized.
p410
aVThey have strong support for the teachers,
p411
aVclose links with the community and a broad and diverse curriculum,
p412
aVand often programs which involve students outside school as well as inside school.
p413
aVAnd they work.
p414
aVWhat's interesting to me is, these are called "alternative education."
p415
aa(lp416
V(Laughter)
p417
aa(lp418
VYou know?
p419
aVAnd all the evidence from around the world is,
p420
aVif we all did that, there'd be no need for the alternative.
p421
aa(lp422
V(Applause)
p423
aa(lp424
V(Applause ends)
p425
aa(lp426
VSo I think we have to embrace a different metaphor.
p427
aVWe have to recognize that it's a human system,
p428
aVand there are conditions under which people thrive,
p429
aVand conditions under which they don't.
p430
aVWe are after all organic creatures,
p431
aVand the culture of the school is absolutely essential.
p432
aVCulture is an organic term, isn't it?
p433
aa(lp434
VNot far from where I live is a place called Death Valley.
p435
aVDeath Valley is the hottest, driest place in America,
p436
aVand nothing grows there.
p437
aVNothing grows there because it doesn't rain.
p438
aVHence, Death Valley.
p439
aVIn the winter of 2004, it rained in Death Valley.
p440
aVSeven inches of rain fell over a very short period.
p441
aVAnd in the spring of 2005, there was a phenomenon.
p442
aVThe whole floor of Death Valley was carpeted in flowers for a while.
p443
aVWhat it proved is this:
p444
aVthat Death Valley isn't dead.
p445
aVIt's dormant.
p446
aVRight beneath the surface are these seeds of possibility
p447
aVwaiting for the right conditions to come about,
p448
aVand with organic systems, if the conditions are right,
p449
aVlife is inevitable.
p450
aVIt happens all the time.
p451
aVYou take an area, a school, a district,
p452
aVyou change the conditions, give people a different sense of possibility,
p453
aVa different set of expectations, a broader range of opportunities,
p454
aVyou cherish and value the relationships between teachers and learners,
p455
aVyou offer people the discretion to be creative
p456
aVand to innovate in what they do,
p457
aVand schools that were once bereft spring to life.
p458
aa(lp459
VGreat leaders know that.
p460
aVThe real role of leadership in education \u2014
p461
aVand I think it's true at the national level,
p462
aVthe state level, at the school level \u2014
p463
aVis not and should not be command and control.
p464
aVThe real role of leadership is climate control,
p465
aVcreating a climate of possibility.
p466
aVAnd if you do that, people will rise to it
p467
aVand achieve things that you completely did not anticipate
p468
aVand couldn't have expected.
p469
aa(lp470
VThere's a wonderful quote from Benjamin Franklin.
p471
aV"There are three sorts of people in the world:
p472
aVThose who are immovable,
p473
aVpeople who don't get it,
p474
aVor don't want to do anything about it;
p475
aVthere are people who are movable,
p476
aVpeople who see the need for change
p477
aVand are prepared to listen to it;
p478
aVand there are people who move,
p479
aVpeople who make things happen."
p480
aVAnd if we can encourage more people, that will be a movement.
p481
aVAnd if the movement is strong enough,
p482
aVthat's, in the best sense of the word, a revolution.
p483
aVAnd that's what we need.
p484
aa(lp485
VThank you very much.
