VLet's talk about trust.
p4
aVWe all know trust is fundamental,
p5
aVbut when it comes to trusting people,
p6
aVsomething profound is happening.
p7
aa(lp8
VPlease raise your hand
p9
aVif you have ever been a host or a guest on Airbnb.
p10
aVWow. That's a lot of you.
p11
aa(lp12
VWho owns Bitcoin?
p13
aVStill a lot of you. OK.
p14
aa(lp15
VAnd please raise your hand if you've ever used Tinder
p16
aVto help you find a mate.
p17
aa(lp18
V(Laughter)
p19
aa(lp20
VThis one's really hard to count because you're kind of going like this.
p21
aa(lp22
V(Laughter)
p23
aa(lp24
VThese are all examples of how technology
p25
aVis creating new mechanisms
p26
aVthat are enabling us to trust unknown people, companies and ideas.
p27
aVAnd yet at the same time,
p28
aVtrust in institutions \u2014
p29
aVbanks, governments and even churches \u2014
p30
aVis collapsing.
p31
aVSo what's happening here,
p32
aVand who do you trust?
p33
aa(lp34
VLet's start in France with a platform \u2014 with a company, I should say \u2014
p35
aVwith a rather funny-sounding name,
p36
aVBlaBlaCar.
p37
aVIt's a platform that matches drivers and passengers
p38
aVwho want to share long-distance journeys together.
p39
aVThe average ride taken is 320 kilometers.
p40
aVSo it's a good idea to choose your fellow travelers wisely.
p41
aVSocial profiles and reviews help people make a choice.
p42
aVYou can see if someone's a smoker, you can see what kind of music they like,
p43
aVyou can see if they're going to bring their dog along for the ride.
p44
aVBut it turns out that the key social identifier
p45
aVis how much you're going to talk in the car.
p46
aa(lp47
V(Laughter)
p48
aa(lp49
VBla, not a lot,
p50
aVbla bla, you want a nice bit of chitchat,
p51
aVand bla bla bla, you're not going to stop talking the entire way
p52
aVfrom London to Paris.
p53
aa(lp54
V(Laughter)
p55
aa(lp56
VIt's remarkable, right, that this idea works at all,
p57
aVbecause it's counter to the lesson most of us were taught as a child:
p58
aVnever get in a car with a stranger.
p59
aVAnd yet, BlaBlaCar transports more than four million people
p60
aVevery single month.
p61
aVTo put that in context, that's more passengers
p62
aVthan the Eurostar or JetBlue airlines carry.
p63
aVBlaBlaCar is a beautiful illustration of how technology is enabling
p64
aVmillions of people across the world to take a trust leap.
p65
aa(lp66
VA trust leap happens when we take the risk to do something new or different
p67
aVto the way that we've always done it.
p68
aVLet's try to visualize this together.
p69
aVOK. I want you to close your eyes.
p70
aVThere is a man staring at me with his eyes wide open.
p71
aVI'm on this big red circle. I can see.
p72
aVSo close your eyes.
p73
aa(lp74
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p75
aa(lp76
VI'll do it with you.
p77
aVAnd I want you to imagine there exists a gap
p78
aVbetween you and something unknown.
p79
aVThat unknown can be someone you've just met.
p80
aVIt can be a place you've never been to.
p81
aVIt can be something you've never tried before.
p82
aVYou got it?
p83
aVOK. You can open your eyes now.
p84
aVFor you to leap from a place of certainty,
p85
aVto take a chance on that someone or something unknown,
p86
aVyou need a force to pull you over the gap,
p87
aVand that remarkable force is trust.
p88
aa(lp89
VTrust is an elusive concept,
p90
aVand yet we depend on it for our lives to function.
p91
aVI trust my children
p92
aVwhen they say they're going to turn the lights out at night.
p93
aVI trusted the pilot who flew me here to keep me safe.
p94
aVIt's a word we use a lot,
p95
aVwithout always thinking about what it really means
p96
aVand how it works in different contexts of our lives.
p97
aa(lp98
VThere are, in fact, hundreds of definitions of trust,
p99
aVand most can be reduced to some kind of risk assessment
p100
aVof how likely it is that things will go right.
p101
aVBut I don't like this definition of trust,
p102
aVbecause it makes trust sound rational and predictable,
p103
aVand it doesn't really get to the human essence
p104
aVof what it enables us to do
p105
aVand how it empowers us
p106
aVto connect with other people.
p107
aa(lp108
VSo I define trust a little differently.
p109
aVI define trust as a confident relationship to the unknown.
p110
aVNow, when you view trust through this lens,
p111
aVit starts to explain why it has the unique capacity
p112
aVto enable us to cope with uncertainty,
p113
aVto place our faith in strangers,
p114
aVto keep moving forward.
p115
aa(lp116
VHuman beings are remarkable
p117
aVat taking trust leaps.
p118
aVDo you remember the first time you put your credit card details
p119
aVinto a website?
p120
aVThat's a trust leap.
p121
aVI distinctly remember telling my dad
p122
aVthat I wanted to buy a navy blue secondhand Peugeot on eBay,
p123
aVand he rightfully pointed out
p124
aVthat the seller's name was "Invisible Wizard"
p125
aVand that this probably was not such a good idea.
p126
aa(lp127
V(Laughter)
p128
aa(lp129
VSo my work, my research focuses on how technology
p130
aVis transforming the social glue of society,
p131
aVtrust between people,
p132
aVand it's a fascinating area to study,
p133
aVbecause there's still so much we do not know.
p134
aVFor instance, do men and women trust differently in digital environments?
p135
aVDoes the way we build trust face-to-face translate online?
p136
aVDoes trust transfer?
p137
aVSo if you trust finding a mate on Tinder,
p138
aVare you more likely to trust finding a ride on BlaBlaCar?
p139
aa(lp140
VBut from studying hundreds of networks and marketplaces,
p141
aVthere is a common pattern that people follow,
p142
aVand I call it "climbing the trust stack."
p143
aVLet me use BlaBlaCar as an example to bring it to life.
p144
aVOn the first level,
p145
aVyou have to trust the idea.
p146
aVSo you have to trust
p147
aVthe idea of ride-sharing is safe and worth trying.
p148
aVThe second level is about having confidence in the platform,
p149
aVthat BlaBlaCar will help you if something goes wrong.
p150
aVAnd the third level is about using little bits of information
p151
aVto decide whether the other person is trustworthy.
p152
aa(lp153
VNow, the first time we climb the trust stack,
p154
aVit feels weird, even risky,
p155
aVbut we get to a point where these ideas seem totally normal.
p156
aVOur behaviors transform,
p157
aVoften relatively quickly.
p158
aVIn other words, trust enables change and innovation.
p159
aa(lp160
VSo an idea that intrigued me, and I'd like you to consider,
p161
aVis whether we can better understand
p162
aVmajor waves of disruption and change in individuals in society
p163
aVthrough the lens of trust.
p164
aVWell, it turns out that trust has only evolved
p165
aVin three significant chapters throughout the course of human history:
p166
aVlocal, institutional
p167
aVand what we're now entering, distributed.
p168
aa(lp169
VSo for a long time,
p170
aVuntil the mid-1800s,
p171
aVtrust was built around tight-knit relationships.
p172
aVSo say I lived in a village
p173
aVwith the first five rows of this audience,
p174
aVand we all knew one another,
p175
aVand say I wanted to borrow money.
p176
aVThe man who had his eyes wide open, he might lend it to me,
p177
aVand if I didn't pay him back,
p178
aVyou'd all know I was dodgy.
p179
aVI would get a bad reputation,
p180
aVand you would refuse to do business with me in the future.
p181
aVTrust was mostly local and accountability-based.
p182
aa(lp183
VIn the mid-19th century,
p184
aVsociety went through a tremendous amount of change.
p185
aVPeople moved to fast-growing cities such as London and San Francisco,
p186
aVand a local banker here was replaced by large corporations
p187
aVthat didn't know us as individuals.
p188
aVWe started to place our trust
p189
aVinto black box systems of authority,
p190
aVthings like legal contracts and regulation and insurance,
p191
aVand less trust directly in other people.
p192
aVTrust became institutional and commission-based.
p193
aa(lp194
VIt's widely talked about how trust in institutions and many corporate brands
p195
aVhas been steadily declining and continues to do so.
p196
aVI am constantly stunned by major breaches of trust:
p197
aVthe News Corp phone hacking,
p198
aVthe Volkswagen emissions scandal,
p199
aVthe widespread abuse in the Catholic Church,
p200
aVthe fact that only one measly banker
p201
aVwent to jail after the great financial crisis,
p202
aVor more recently the Panama Papers
p203
aVthat revealed how the rich can exploit offshore tax regimes.
p204
aVAnd the thing that really surprises me
p205
aVis why do leaders find it so hard
p206
aVto apologize, I mean sincerely apologize,
p207
aVwhen our trust is broken?
p208
aa(lp209
VIt would be easy to conclude that institutional trust isn't working
p210
aVbecause we are fed up
p211
aVwith the sheer audacity of dishonest elites,
p212
aVbut what's happening now
p213
aVruns deeper than the rampant questioning of the size and structure of institutions.
p214
aVWe're starting to realize
p215
aVthat institutional trust
p216
aVwasn't designed for the digital age.
p217
aVConventions of how trust is built,
p218
aVmanaged, lost and repaired \u2014
p219
aVin brands, leaders and entire systems \u2014
p220
aVis being turned upside down.
p221
aa(lp222
VNow, this is exciting,
p223
aVbut it's frightening,
p224
aVbecause it forces many of us to have to rethink
p225
aVhow trust is built and destroyed with our customers, with our employees,
p226
aVeven our loved ones.
p227
aa(lp228
VThe other day, I was talking to the CEO of a leading international hotel brand,
p229
aVand as is often the case, we got onto the topic of Airbnb.
p230
aVAnd he admitted to me that he was perplexed by their success.
p231
aVHe was perplexed at how a company
p232
aVthat depends on the willingness of strangers to trust one another
p233
aVcould work so well across 191 countries.
p234
aVSo I said to him that I had a confession to make,
p235
aVand he looked at me a bit strangely,
p236
aVand I said \u2014
p237
aVand I'm sure many of you do this as well \u2014
p238
aVI don't always bother to hang my towels up
p239
aVwhen I'm finished in the hotel,
p240
aVbut I would never do this as a guest on Airbnb.
p241
aVAnd the reason why I would never do this as a guest on Airbnb
p242
aVis because guests know that they'll be rated by hosts,
p243
aVand that those ratings are likely to impact their ability
p244
aVto transact in the future.
p245
aVIt's a simple illustration of how online trust will change our behaviors
p246
aVin the real world,
p247
aVmake us more accountable
p248
aVin ways we cannot yet even imagine.
p249
aa(lp250
VI am not saying we do not need hotels
p251
aVor traditional forms of authority.
p252
aVBut what we cannot deny
p253
aVis that the way trust flows through society is changing,
p254
aVand it's creating this big shift
p255
aVaway from the 20th century
p256
aVthat was defined by institutional trust
p257
aVtowards the 21st century
p258
aVthat will be fueled by distributed trust.
p259
aVTrust is no longer top-down.
p260
aVIt's being unbundled and inverted.
p261
aVIt's no longer opaque and linear.
p262
aVA new recipe for trust is emerging
p263
aVthat once again is distributed amongst people
p264
aVand is accountability-based.
p265
aa(lp266
VAnd this shift is only going to accelerate
p267
aVwith the emergence of the blockchain,
p268
aVthe innovative ledger technology underpinning Bitcoin.
p269
aVNow let's be honest,
p270
aVgetting our heads around the way blockchain works
p271
aVis mind-blowing.
p272
aVAnd one of the reasons why is it involves processing
p273
aVsome pretty complicated concepts
p274
aVwith terrible names.
p275
aVI mean, cryptographic algorithms and hash functions,
p276
aVand people called miners, who verify transactions \u2014
p277
aVall that was created by this mysterious person
p278
aVor persons called Satoshi Nakamoto.
p279
aVNow, that is a massive trust leap that hasn't happened yet.
p280
aa(lp281
V(Applause)
p282
aa(lp283
VBut let's try to imagine this.
p284
aVSo "The Economist" eloquently described the blockchain
p285
aVas the great chain of being sure about things.
p286
aVThe easiest way I can describe it is imagine the blocks as spreadsheets,
p287
aVand they are filled with assets.
p288
aVSo that could be a property title.
p289
aVIt could be a stock trade.
p290
aVIt could be a creative asset, such as the rights to a song.
p291
aVEvery time something moves
p292
aVfrom one place on the register to somewhere else,
p293
aVthat asset transfer is time-stamped
p294
aVand publicly recorded on the blockchain.
p295
aVIt's that simple. Right.
p296
aa(lp297
VSo the real implication of the blockchain
p298
aVis that it removes the need for any kind of third party,
p299
aVsuch as a lawyer,
p300
aVor a trusted intermediary, or maybe not a government intermediary
p301
aVto facilitate the exchange.
p302
aVSo if we go back to the trust stack,
p303
aVyou still have to trust the idea,
p304
aVyou have to trust the platform,
p305
aVbut you don't have to trust the other person
p306
aVin the traditional sense.
p307
aa(lp308
VThe implications are huge.
p309
aVIn the same way the internet blew open the doors to an age of information
p310
aVavailable to everyone,
p311
aVthe blockchain will revolutionize trust on a global scale.
p312
aa(lp313
VNow, I've waited to the end intentionally to mention Uber,
p314
aVbecause I recognize that it is a contentious
p315
aVand widely overused example,
p316
aVbut in the context of a new era of trust, it's a great case study.
p317
aVNow, we will see cases of abuse of distributed trust.
p318
aVWe've already seen this, and it can go horribly wrong.
p319
aVI am not surprised that we are seeing protests from taxi associations
p320
aVall around the world
p321
aVtrying to get governments to ban Uber based on claims that it is unsafe.
p322
aVI happened to be in London the day that these protests took place,
p323
aVand I happened to notice a tweet
p324
aVfrom Matt Hancock, who is a British minister for business.
p325
aa(lp326
VAnd he wrote,
p327
aV"Does anyone have details of this #Uber app everyone's talking about?
p328
aa(lp329
V(Laughter)
p330
aa(lp331
VI'd never heard of it until today."
p332
aa(lp333
VNow, the taxi associations,
p334
aVthey legitimized the first layer of the trust stack.
p335
aVThey legitimized the idea that they were trying to eliminate,
p336
aVand sign-ups increased by 850 percent in 24 hours.
p337
aVNow, this is a really strong illustration
p338
aVof how once a trust shift has happened around a behavior or an entire sector,
p339
aVyou cannot reverse the story.
p340
aVEvery day, five million people will take a trust leap
p341
aVand ride with Uber.
p342
aVIn China, on Didi, the ride-sharing platform,
p343
aV11 million rides taken every day.
p344
aVThat's 127 rides per second,
p345
aVshowing that this is a cross-cultural phenomenon.
p346
aa(lp347
VAnd the fascinating thing is that both drivers and passengers report
p348
aVthat seeing a name
p349
aVand seeing someone's photo and their rating
p350
aVmakes them feel safer,
p351
aVand as you may have experienced,
p352
aVeven behave a little more nicely in the taxi cab.
p353
aVUber and Didi are early but powerful examples
p354
aVof how technology is creating trust between people
p355
aVin ways and on a scale never possible before.
p356
aa(lp357
VToday, many of us are comfortable getting into cars driven by strangers.
p358
aVWe meet up with someone we swiped right to be matched with.
p359
aVWe share our homes with people we do not know.
p360
aa(lp361
VThis is just the beginning,
p362
aVbecause the real disruption happening
p363
aVisn't technological.
p364
aVIt's the trust shift it creates,
p365
aVand for my part, I want to help people understand this new era of trust
p366
aVso that we can get it right
p367
aVand we can embrace the opportunities to redesign systems
p368
aVthat are more transparent, inclusive and accountable.
p369
aa(lp370
VThank you very much.
p371
aa(lp372
V(Applause)
p373
aa(lp374
