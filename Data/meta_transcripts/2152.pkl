VWhile preparing for my talk
p4
aVI was reflecting on my life and trying to figure out
p5
aVwhere exactly was that moment when my journey began.
p6
aVA long time passed by, and I simply couldn't figure out
p7
aVthe beginning or the middle or the end of my story.
p8
aVI always used to think that my beginning
p9
aVwas one afternoon in my community when my mother had told me
p10
aVthat I had escaped three arranged marriages by the time I was two.
p11
aVOr one evening when electricity had failed for eight hours in our community,
p12
aVand my dad sat, surrounded by all of us,
p13
aVtelling us stories of when he was a little kid struggling to go to school
p14
aVwhile his father, who was a farmer, wanted him to work in the fields with him.
p15
aVOr that dark night when I was 16
p16
aVwhen three little kids had come to me and they whispered in my ear
p17
aVthat my friend was murdered in something called the honor killings.
p18
aa(lp19
VBut then I realized that,
p20
aVas much as I know that these moments have contributed on my journey,
p21
aVthey have influenced my journey
p22
aVbut they have not been the beginning of it,
p23
aVbut the true beginning of my journey was in front of a mud house
p24
aVin upper Sindh of Pakistan,
p25
aVwhere my father held the hand of my 14-year-old mother
p26
aVand they decided to walk out of the village
p27
aVto go to a town where they could send their kids to school.
p28
aVIn a way, I feel like my life
p29
aVis kind of a result of some wise choices and decisions they've made.
p30
aa(lp31
VAnd just like that, another of their decisions
p32
aVwas to keep me and my siblings connected to our roots.
p33
aVWhile we were living in a community I fondly remember as called Ribabad,
p34
aVwhich means community of the poor,
p35
aVmy dad made sure that we also had a house in our rural homeland.
p36
aVI come from an indigenous tribe in the mountains of Balochistan
p37
aVcalled Brahui.
p38
aVBrahui, or Brohi, means mountain dweller, and it is also my language.
p39
aVThanks to my father's very strict rules about connecting to our customs,
p40
aVI had to live a beautiful life of songs,  cultures, traditions, stories, mountains,
p41
aVand a lot of sheep.
p42
aVBut then, living in two extremes
p43
aVbetween the traditions  of my culture, of my village,
p44
aVand then modern education in my school wasn't easy.
p45
aVI was aware that I was the only girl who got to have such freedom,
p46
aVand I was guilty of it.
p47
aVWhile going to school in Karachi and Hyderabad,
p48
aVa lot of my cousins and childhood friends were getting married off,
p49
aVsome to older men, some in exchange,
p50
aVsome even as second wives.
p51
aVI got to see the beautiful tradition and its magic fade in front of me
p52
aVwhen I saw that the birth of a girl child was celebrated with sadness,
p53
aVwhen women were told to have patience as their main virtue.
p54
aa(lp55
VUp until I was 16,
p56
aVI healed my sadness by crying,
p57
aVmostly at nights  when everyone would sleep
p58
aVand I would sob in my pillow,
p59
aVuntil that one night  when I found out my friend was killed
p60
aVin the name of honor.
p61
aa(lp62
VHonor killings is a custom
p63
aVwhere men and women are suspected of having relationships
p64
aVbefore or outside of the marriage,
p65
aVand they're killed by their family for it.
p66
aVUsually the killer is the brother or father or the uncle in the family.
p67
aVThe U.N. reports there are about 1,000 honor murders every year in Pakistan,
p68
aVand these are only the reported cases.
p69
aa(lp70
VA custom that kills did not make any sense to me,
p71
aVand I knew I had to do something about it this time.
p72
aVI was not going to cry myself to sleep.
p73
aVI was going to do something, anything, to stop it.
p74
aVI was 16 \u2014 I started writing poetry
p75
aVand going door to door telling everybody about honor killings
p76
aVand why it happens, why it should be stopped,
p77
aVand raising awareness about it
p78
aVuntil I actually found a much, much  better way to handle this issue.
p79
aa(lp80
VIn those days, we were living in a very small, one-roomed house in Karachi.
p81
aVEvery year, during the monsoon seasons, our house would flood up with water \u2014
p82
aVrainwater and sewage \u2014
p83
aVand my mom and dad would be taking the water out.
p84
aVIn those days, my dad brought home a huge machine, a computer.
p85
aVIt was so big it looked as if it was going to take up half of the only room we had,
p86
aVand had so many pieces and wires that needed to be connected.
p87
aVBut it was still the most exciting thing
p88
aVthat has ever happened to me and my sisters.
p89
aVMy oldest brother Ali got to be in charge of taking care of the computer,
p90
aVand all of us were given 10 to 15 minutes every day to use it.
p91
aVBeing the oldest of eight kids,
p92
aVI got to use it the last,
p93
aVand that was after I had washed the dishes,
p94
aVcleaned the house, made dinner with my mom,
p95
aVand put blankets on the floor for everyone to sleep,
p96
aVand after that,  I would run to the computer,
p97
aVconnect it to the Internet,
p98
aVand have pure joy and wonder for 10 to 15 minutes.
p99
aa(lp100
VIn those days, I had discovered a website called Joogle.
p101
aV[Google] (Laughter)
p102
aVIn my frantic wish to do something about this custom,
p103
aVI made use of Google and discovered Facebook,
p104
aVa website where people can connect to anyone around the world,
p105
aVand so, from my very tiny, cement-roofed room in Karachi,
p106
aVI connected with people in the U.K., the U.S., Australia and Canada,
p107
aVand created a campaign called
p108
aVWAKE UP Campaign against Honor Killings.
p109
aVIt became enormous in just a few months.
p110
aVI got a lot of support from all around the world.
p111
aVMedia was connecting to us.
p112
aVA lot of people were reaching out trying to raise awareness with us.
p113
aVIt became so big that it went from online to the streets of my hometown,
p114
aVwhere we would do rallies and strikes
p115
aVtrying to change the policies  in Pakistan for women's support.
p116
aVAnd while I thought everything was perfect,
p117
aVmy team \u2014 which was basically my friends and neighbors at that time \u2014
p118
aVthought everything was going so well,
p119
aVwe had no idea a big opposition was coming to us.
p120
aa(lp121
VMy community stood up against us,
p122
aVsaying we were spreading un-Islamic behavior.
p123
aVWe were challenging centuries-old customs in those communities.
p124
aVI remember my father receiving anonymous letters
p125
aVsaying, "Your daughter  is spreading Western culture
p126
aVin the honorable societies."
p127
aVOur car was stoned at one point.
p128
aVOne day I went to the office and found our metal signboard
p129
aVwrinkled and broken as if a lot of people had been hitting it with something heavy.
p130
aVThings got so bad that I had to hide myself in many ways.
p131
aVI would put up the windows of the car,
p132
aVveil my face, not speak while I was in public,
p133
aVbut eventually situations got worse when my life was threatened,
p134
aVand I had to leave, back to Karachi, and our actions stopped.
p135
aa(lp136
VBack in Karachi, as an 18-year-old,
p137
aVI thought this was the biggest failure of my entire life.
p138
aVI was devastated.
p139
aVAs a teenager, I was blaming myself for everything that happened.
p140
aVAnd it turns out, when we started reflecting,
p141
aVwe did realize that it was actually me and my team's fault.
p142
aa(lp143
VThere were two big reasons why our campaign had failed big time.
p144
aVOne of those, the first reason,
p145
aVis we were standing against core values of people.
p146
aVWe were saying no to something that was very important to them,
p147
aVchallenging their code of honor,
p148
aVand hurting them deeply in the process.
p149
aVAnd number two, which was very important for me to learn,
p150
aVand amazing, and surprising for me to learn,
p151
aVwas that we were not including the true heroes
p152
aVwho should be fighting for themselves.
p153
aVThe women in the villages had no idea we were fighting for them in the streets.
p154
aVEvery time I would go back,
p155
aVI would find my cousins and friends with scarves on their faces,
p156
aVand I would ask, "What happened?"
p157
aVAnd they'd be like,  "Our husbands beat us."
p158
aVBut we are working in the streets for you!
p159
aVWe are changing the policies.
p160
aVHow is that not impacting their life?
p161
aa(lp162
VSo then we found out something which was very amazing for us.
p163
aVThe policies of a country
p164
aVdo not necessarily always affect the tribal and rural communities.
p165
aVIt was devastating \u2014 like, oh, we can't actually do something about this?
p166
aVAnd we found out there's a huge gap
p167
aVwhen it comes to official policies and the real truth on the ground.
p168
aa(lp169
VSo this time, we were like, we are going to do something different.
p170
aVWe are going to use strategy,
p171
aVand we are going to go back and apologize.
p172
aVYes, apologize.
p173
aVWe went back to the communities
p174
aVand we said we are  very ashamed of what we did.
p175
aVWe are here to apologize, and in fact, we are here to make it up to you.
p176
aVHow do we do that?
p177
aVWe are going to promote three of your main cultures.
p178
aVWe know that it's music, language, and embroidery.
p179
aa(lp180
VNobody believed us.
p181
aVNobody wanted to work with us.
p182
aVIt took a lot of convincing and discussions with these communities
p183
aVuntil they agreed that we are going to promote their language
p184
aVby making a booklet of their stories, fables and old tales in the tribe,
p185
aVand we would promote their music
p186
aVby making a CD of the songs from the tribe, and some drumbeating.
p187
aVAnd the third, which was my favorite,
p188
aVwas we would promote their embroidery by making a center in the village
p189
aVwhere women would come every day to make embroidery.
p190
aa(lp191
VAnd so it began.
p192
aVWe worked with one village, and we started our first center.
p193
aVIt was a beautiful day.
p194
aVWe started the center.
p195
aVWomen were coming to make embroidery,
p196
aVand going through a life-changing process of education,
p197
aVlearning about their rights, what Islam says about their rights,
p198
aVand enterprise development, how they can create money,
p199
aVand then how they can create money from money,
p200
aVhow they can fight the customs that have been destroying their lives
p201
aVfrom so many centuries,
p202
aVbecause in Islam, in reality,
p203
aVwomen are supposed to be shoulder to shoulder with men.
p204
aVWomen have so much status that we have not been hearing,
p205
aVthat they have not been hearing,
p206
aVand we needed to tell them that they need to know
p207
aVwhere their rights are and how to take them by themselves,
p208
aVbecause they can do it and we can't.
p209
aa(lp210
VSo this was the model which actually came out \u2014 very amazing.
p211
aVThrough embroidery we were promoting their traditions.
p212
aVWe went into the village. We would mobilize the community.
p213
aVWe would make a center inside where 30 women will come
p214
aVfor six months to learn about value addition of traditional embroidery,
p215
aVenterprise development, life skills and basic education,
p216
aVand about their rights and how to say no to those customs
p217
aVand how to stand as leaders for themselves and the society.
p218
aVAfter six months, we would connect these women to loans and to markets
p219
aVwhere they can become local entrepreneurs in their communities.
p220
aa(lp221
VWe soon called this project Sughar.
p222
aVSughar is a local word used in many, many languages in Pakistan.
p223
aVIt means skilled and confident women.
p224
aVI truly believe, to create women leaders, there's only one thing you have to do:
p225
aVJust let them know that they have what it takes to be a leader.
p226
aVThese women you see here,
p227
aVthey have strong skills and potential to be leaders.
p228
aVAll we had to do was remove the barriers that surrounded them,
p229
aVand that's what we decided to do.
p230
aa(lp231
VBut then while we were thinking everything was going well,
p232
aVonce again everything was fantastic,
p233
aVwe found our next setback:
p234
aVA lot of men started seeing the visible changes in their wife.
p235
aVShe's speaking more, she's making decisions \u2014
p236
aVoh my gosh, she's handling  everything in the house.
p237
aVThey stopped them from coming to the centers,
p238
aVand this time, we were like, okay, time for strategy two.
p239
aVWe went to the fashion  industry in Pakistan
p240
aVand decided to do research about what happens there.
p241
aVTurns out the fashion industry in Pakistan is very strong and growing day by day,
p242
aVbut there is less contribution from the tribal areas
p243
aVand to the tribal areas, especially women.
p244
aa(lp245
VSo we decided to launch our first ever tribal women's very own fashion brand,
p246
aVwhich is now called Nomads.
p247
aVAnd so women started earning more,
p248
aVthey started contributing more financially to the house,
p249
aVand men had to think again before saying no to them
p250
aVwhen they were coming to the centers.
p251
aa(lp252
V(Applause)
p253
aVThank you, thank you.
p254
aa(lp255
VIn 2013, we launched our first Sughar Hub instead of a center.
p256
aVWe partnered with TripAdvisor
p257
aVand created a cement hall in the middle of a village
p258
aVand invited so many other organizations to work over there.
p259
aVWe created this platform for the nonprofits
p260
aVso they can touch and work on the other issues
p261
aVthat Sughar is not working on,
p262
aVwhich would be an easy place  for them to give trainings,
p263
aVuse it as a farmer school, even as a marketplace,
p264
aVand anything they want to use it for,
p265
aVand they have been doing really amazingly.
p266
aVAnd so far, we have been able to support 900 women
p267
aVin 24 villages around Pakistan.
p268
aV(Applause)
p269
aa(lp270
VBut that's actually not what I want.
p271
aVMy dream is to reach out to one million women in the next 10 years,
p272
aVand to make sure that happens,
p273
aVthis year we launched Sughar Foundation in the U.S.
p274
aVIt is not just going to fund Sughar but many other organizations in Pakistan
p275
aVto replicate the idea
p276
aVand to find even more innovative ways
p277
aVto unleash the rural women's potential in Pakistan.
p278
aa(lp279
VThank you so much.
p280
aa(lp281
V(Applause)
p282
aVThank you. Thank you. Thank you.
p283
aa(lp284
VChris Anderson: Khalida, you are quite the force of nature.
p285
aVI mean, this story, in many ways, just seems beyond belief.
p286
aVIt's incredible that someone so young could do achieve this much
p287
aVthrough so much force and ingenuity.
p288
aVSo I guess one question:
p289
aVThis is a spectacular dream to reach out and empower a million women \u2014
p290
aVhow much of the current  success depends on you,
p291
aVthe force of this magnetic personality?
p292
aVHow does it scale?
p293
aa(lp294
VKhalida Brohi: I think my job is to give the inspiration out,
p295
aVgive my dream out.
p296
aVI can't teach how to do it, because there are so many different ways.
p297
aVWe have been experimenting with three ways only.
p298
aVThere are a hundred different ways to unleash potential in women.
p299
aVI would just give the inspiration and that's my job.
p300
aVI will keep doing it. Sughar will still be growing.
p301
aVWe are planning to reach out to two more villages,
p302
aVand soon I believe  we will be scaling out of Pakistan
p303
aVinto South Asia and beyond.
p304
aa(lp305
VCA: I love that when you talked about your team in the talk,
p306
aVI mean, you were all 18 at the time.
p307
aVWhat did this team look like?
p308
aVThis was school friends, right?
p309
aa(lp310
VKB: Do people here believe that I'm at an age
p311
aVwhere I'm supposed to be a grandmother in my village?
p312
aVMy mom was married at nine, and I am the oldest woman not married
p313
aVand not doing anything in my life in my village.
p314
aa(lp315
VCA: Wait, wait, wait, not doing anything?
p316
aa(lp317
VKB: No. CA: You're right.
p318
aa(lp319
VKB: People feel sorry for me, a lot of times.
p320
aa(lp321
VCA: But how much time are you spending now actually back in Balochistan?
p322
aVKB: I live over there.
p323
aVWe live between, still, Karachi and Balochistan.
p324
aVMy siblings are all going to school.
p325
aVI am still the oldest of eight siblings.
p326
aa(lp327
VCA: But what you're doing is definitely threatening to some people there.
p328
aVHow do you handle safety? Do you feel safe?
p329
aVAre there issues there?
p330
aa(lp331
VKB: This question has come to me a lot of times before,
p332
aVand I feel like the word "fear" just comes to me and then drops,
p333
aVbut there is one fear that I have that is different from that.
p334
aVThe fear is that if I get killed, what would happen to the people
p335
aVwho love me so much?
p336
aVMy mom waits for me till late at night that I should come home.
p337
aVMy sisters want to learn so much from me,
p338
aVand there are many, many girls in my community who want to talk to me
p339
aVand ask me different things,
p340
aVand I recently got engaged. (Laughs)
p341
aV(Applause)
p342
aa(lp343
VCA: Is he here? You've got to stand up.
p344
aV(Applause)
p345
aa(lp346
VKB: Escaping arranged marriages, I chose my own husband
p347
aVacross the world in L.A., a really different world.
p348
aVI had to fight for a whole year. That's totally a different story.
p349
aVBut I think that's the only thing that I'm afraid of,
p350
aVand I don't want my mom to not see anyone when she waits in the night.
p351
aa(lp352
VCA: So people who want to help you on their way,
p353
aVthey can go on, they can maybe buy some of these clothes
p354
aVthat you're bringing over
p355
aVthat are actually made, the embroidery is done back in Balochistan?
p356
aa(lp357
VKB: Yeah.
p358
aa(lp359
VCA: Or they can get involved in the foundation.
p360
aa(lp361
VKB: Definitely. We are looking for as many people as we can,
p362
aVbecause now that the foundation's in the beginning process,
p363
aVI am trying to learn a lot about how to operate,
p364
aVhow to get funding or reach out to more organizations,
p365
aVand especially in the e-commerce, which is very new for me.
p366
aVI mean, I am not a fashion person, believe me.
p367
aa(lp368
VCA: Well, it's been incredible to have you here.
p369
aVPlease go on being courageous, go on being smart, and please stay safe.
p370
aa(lp371
VKB: Thank you so much. CA: Thank you, Khalida. (Applause)
