VWhen we park in a big parking lot,
p4
aVhow do we remember where we parked our car?
p5
aVHere's the problem facing Homer.
p6
aVAnd we're going to try to understand
p7
aVwhat's happening in his brain.
p8
aa(lp9
VSo we'll start with the hippocampus, shown in yellow,
p10
aVwhich is the organ of memory.
p11
aVIf you have damage there, like in Alzheimer's,
p12
aVyou can't remember things including where you parked your car.
p13
aVIt's named after Latin for "seahorse,"
p14
aVwhich it resembles.
p15
aVAnd like the rest of the brain, it's made of neurons.
p16
aa(lp17
VSo the human brain
p18
aVhas about a hundred billion neurons in it.
p19
aVAnd the neurons communicate with each other
p20
aVby sending little pulses or spikes of electricity
p21
aVvia connections to each other.
p22
aVThe hippocampus is formed of two sheets of cells,
p23
aVwhich are very densely interconnected.
p24
aVAnd scientists have begun to understand
p25
aVhow spatial memory works
p26
aVby recording from individual neurons
p27
aVin rats or mice
p28
aVwhile they forage or explore an environment
p29
aVlooking for food.
p30
aa(lp31
VSo we're going to imagine we're recording from a single neuron
p32
aVin the hippocampus of this rat here.
p33
aVAnd when it fires a little spike of electricity,
p34
aVthere's going to be a red dot and a click.
p35
aVSo what we see
p36
aVis that this neuron knows
p37
aVwhenever the rat has gone into one particular place in its environment.
p38
aVAnd it signals to the rest of the brain
p39
aVby sending a little electrical spike.
p40
aVSo we could show the firing rate of that neuron
p41
aVas a function of the animal's location.
p42
aVAnd if we record from lots of different neurons,
p43
aVwe'll see that different neurons fire
p44
aVwhen the animal goes in different parts of its environment,
p45
aVlike in this square box shown here.
p46
aVSo together they form a map
p47
aVfor the rest of the brain,
p48
aVtelling the brain continually,
p49
aV"Where am I now within my environment?"
p50
aa(lp51
VPlace cells are also being recorded in humans.
p52
aVSo epilepsy patients sometimes need
p53
aVthe electrical activity in their brain monitoring.
p54
aVAnd some of these patients played a video game
p55
aVwhere they drive around a small town.
p56
aVAnd place cells in their hippocampi would fire, become active,
p57
aVstart sending electrical impulses
p58
aVwhenever they drove through a particular location in that town.
p59
aa(lp60
VSo how does a place cell know
p61
aVwhere the rat or person is within its environment?
p62
aVWell these two cells here
p63
aVshow us that the boundaries of the environment
p64
aVare particularly important.
p65
aVSo the one on the top
p66
aVlikes to fire sort of midway between the walls
p67
aVof the box that their rat's in.
p68
aVAnd when you expand the box, the firing location expands.
p69
aVThe one below likes to fire
p70
aVwhenever there's a wall close by to the south.
p71
aVAnd if you put another wall inside the box,
p72
aVthen the cell fires in both place
p73
aVwherever there's a wall to the south
p74
aVas the animal explores around in its box.
p75
aVSo this predicts
p76
aVthat sensing the distances and directions of boundaries around you \u2014
p77
aVextended buildings and so on \u2014
p78
aVis particularly important for the hippocampus.
p79
aVAnd indeed, on the inputs to the hippocampus,
p80
aVcells are found which project into the hippocampus,
p81
aVwhich do respond exactly
p82
aVto detecting boundaries or edges
p83
aVat particular distances and directions
p84
aVfrom the rat or mouse
p85
aVas it's exploring around.
p86
aa(lp87
VSo the cell on the left, you can see,
p88
aVit fires whenever the animal gets near
p89
aVto a wall or a boundary to the east,
p90
aVwhether it's the edge or the wall of a square box
p91
aVor the circular wall of the circular box
p92
aVor even the drop at the edge of a table, which the animals are running around.
p93
aVAnd the cell on the right there
p94
aVfires whenever there's a boundary to the south,
p95
aVwhether it's the drop at the edge of the table or a wall
p96
aVor even the gap between two tables that are pulled apart.
p97
aVSo that's one way in which we think
p98
aVplace cells determine where the animal is as it's exploring around.
p99
aa(lp100
VWe can also test where we think objects are,
p101
aVlike this goal flag, in simple environments \u2014
p102
aVor indeed, where your car would be.
p103
aVSo we can have people explore an environment
p104
aVand see the location they have to remember.
p105
aVAnd then, if we put them back in the environment,
p106
aVgenerally they're quite good at putting a marker down
p107
aVwhere they thought that flag or their car was.
p108
aVBut on some trials,
p109
aVwe could change the shape and size of the environment
p110
aVlike we did with the place cell.
p111
aa(lp112
VIn that case, we can see
p113
aVhow where they think the flag had been changes
p114
aVas a function of how you change the shape and size of the environment.
p115
aVAnd what you see, for example,
p116
aVif the flag was where that cross was in a small square environment,
p117
aVand then if you ask people where it was,
p118
aVbut you've made the environment bigger,
p119
aVwhere they think the flag had been
p120
aVstretches out in exactly the same way
p121
aVthat the place cell firing stretched out.
p122
aVIt's as if you remember where the flag was
p123
aVby storing the pattern of firing across all of your place cells
p124
aVat that location,
p125
aVand then you can get back to that location
p126
aVby moving around
p127
aVso that you best match the current pattern of firing of your place cells
p128
aVwith that stored pattern.
p129
aVThat guides you back to the location that you want to remember.
p130
aa(lp131
VBut we also know where we are through movement.
p132
aVSo if we take some outbound path \u2014
p133
aVperhaps we park and we wander off \u2014
p134
aVwe know because our own movements,
p135
aVwhich we can integrate over this path
p136
aVroughly what the heading direction is to go back.
p137
aVAnd place cells also get this kind of path integration input
p138
aVfrom a kind of cell called a grid cell.
p139
aa(lp140
VNow grid cells are found, again,
p141
aVon the inputs to the hippocampus,
p142
aVand they're a bit like place cells.
p143
aVBut now as the rat explores around,
p144
aVeach individual cell fires
p145
aVin a whole array of different locations
p146
aVwhich are laid out across the environment
p147
aVin an amazingly regular triangular grid.
p148
aVAnd if you record from several grid cells \u2014
p149
aVshown here in different colors \u2014
p150
aVeach one has a grid-like firing pattern across the environment,
p151
aVand each cell's grid-like firing pattern is shifted slightly
p152
aVrelative to the other cells.
p153
aVSo the red one fires on this grid
p154
aVand the green one on this one and the blue on on this one.
p155
aa(lp156
VSo together, it's as if the rat
p157
aVcan put a virtual grid of firing locations
p158
aVacross its environment \u2014
p159
aVa bit like the latitude and longitude lines that you'd find on a map,
p160
aVbut using triangles.
p161
aVAnd as it moves around,
p162
aVthe electrical activity can pass
p163
aVfrom one of these cells to the next cell
p164
aVto keep track of where it is,
p165
aVso that it can use its own movements
p166
aVto know where it is in its environment.
p167
aa(lp168
VDo people have grid cells?
p169
aVWell because all of the grid-like firing patterns
p170
aVhave the same axes of symmetry,
p171
aVthe same orientations of grid, shown in orange here,
p172
aVit means that the net activity
p173
aVof all of the grid cells in a particular part of the brain
p174
aVshould change
p175
aVaccording to whether we're running along these six directions
p176
aVor running along one of the six directions in between.
p177
aVSo we can put people in an MRI scanner
p178
aVand have them do a little video game
p179
aVlike the one I showed you
p180
aVand look for this signal.
p181
aVAnd indeed, you do see it in the human entorhinal cortex,
p182
aVwhich is the same part of the brain that you see grid cells in rats.
p183
aa(lp184
VSo back to Homer.
p185
aVHe's probably remembering where his car was
p186
aVin terms of the distances and directions
p187
aVto extended buildings and boundaries
p188
aVaround the location where he parked.
p189
aVAnd that would be represented
p190
aVby the firing of boundary-detecting cells.
p191
aVHe's also remembering the path he took out of the car park,
p192
aVwhich would be represented in the firing of grid cells.
p193
aVNow both of these kinds of cells
p194
aVcan make the place cells fire.
p195
aVAnd he can return to the location where he parked
p196
aVby moving so as to find where it is
p197
aVthat best matches the firing pattern
p198
aVof the place cells in his brain currently
p199
aVwith the stored pattern where he parked his car.
p200
aVAnd that guides him back to that location
p201
aVirrespective of visual cues
p202
aVlike whether his car's actually there.
p203
aVMaybe it's been towed.
p204
aVBut he knows where it was, so he knows to go and get it.
p205
aa(lp206
VSo beyond spatial memory,
p207
aVif we look for this grid-like firing pattern
p208
aVthroughout the whole brain,
p209
aVwe see it in a whole series of locations
p210
aVwhich are always active
p211
aVwhen we do all kinds of autobiographical memory tasks,
p212
aVlike remembering the last time you went to a wedding, for example.
p213
aVSo it may be that the neural mechanisms
p214
aVfor representing the space around us
p215
aVare also used for generating visual imagery
p216
aVso that we can recreate the spatial scene, at least,
p217
aVof the events that have happened to us when we want to imagine them.
p218
aa(lp219
VSo if this was happening,
p220
aVyour memories could start by place cells activating each other
p221
aVvia these dense interconnections
p222
aVand then reactivating boundary cells
p223
aVto create the spatial structure
p224
aVof the scene around your viewpoint.
p225
aVAnd grid cells could move this viewpoint through that space.
p226
aVAnother kind of cell, head direction cells,
p227
aVwhich I didn't mention yet,
p228
aVthey fire like a compass according to which way you're facing.
p229
aVThey could define the viewing direction
p230
aVfrom which you want to generate an image for your visual imagery,
p231
aVso you can imagine what happened when you were at this wedding, for example.
p232
aa(lp233
VSo this is just one example
p234
aVof a new era really
p235
aVin cognitive neuroscience
p236
aVwhere we're beginning to understand
p237
aVpsychological processes
p238
aVlike how you remember or imagine or even think
p239
aVin terms of the actions
p240
aVof the billions of individual neurons that make up our brains.
