VMobility in developing world cities
p4
aVis a very peculiar challenge,
p5
aVbecause different from health
p6
aVor education or housing,
p7
aVit tends to get worse as societies become richer.
p8
aVClearly, a unsustainable model.
p9
aVMobility, as most other developing country problems,
p10
aVmore than a matter of money or technology,
p11
aVis a matter of equality, equity.
p12
aVThe great inequality in developing countries
p13
aVmakes it difficult to see, for example,
p14
aVthat in terms of transport,
p15
aVan advanced city is not one
p16
aVwhere even the poor use cars,
p17
aVbut rather one where even the rich
p18
aVuse public transport.
p19
aVOr bicycles: For example, in Amsterdam,
p20
aVmore than 30 percent of the population
p21
aVuses bicycles,
p22
aVdespite the fact that the Netherlands has
p23
aVa higher income per capita than the United States.
p24
aVThere is a conflict in developing world cities
p25
aVfor money, for government investment.
p26
aVIf more money is invested in highways,
p27
aVof course there is less money for housing,
p28
aVfor schools, for hospitals,
p29
aVand also there is a conflict for space.
p30
aVThere is a conflict for space between
p31
aVthose with cars and those without them.
p32
aVMost of us accept today
p33
aVthat private property and a market economy
p34
aVis the best way to manage most of society's resources.
p35
aVHowever, there is a problem with that,
p36
aVthat market economy needs
p37
aVinequality of income in order to work.
p38
aVSome people must make more money,
p39
aVsome others less.
p40
aVSome companies succeed. Others fail.
p41
aVThen what kind of equality
p42
aVcan we hope for today
p43
aVwith a market economy?
p44
aa(lp45
VI would propose two kinds
p46
aVwhich both have much to do with cities.
p47
aVThe first one is equality of quality of life,
p48
aVespecially for children,
p49
aVthat all children should have,
p50
aVbeyond the obvious health and education,
p51
aVaccess to green spaces, to sports facilities,
p52
aVto swimming pools, to music lessons.
p53
aVAnd the second kind of equality
p54
aVis one which we could call "democratic equality."
p55
aVThe first article in every constitution states
p56
aVthat all citizens are equal before the law.
p57
aVThat is not just poetry.
p58
aVIt's a very powerful principle.
p59
aVFor example, if that is true,
p60
aVa bus with 80 passengers
p61
aVhas a right to 80 times more road space
p62
aVthan a car with one.
p63
aa(lp64
VWe have been so used to inequality, sometimes,
p65
aVthat it's before our noses and we do not see it.
p66
aVLess than 100 years ago,
p67
aVwomen could not vote,
p68
aVand it seemed normal,
p69
aVin the same way that it seems normal today
p70
aVto see a bus in traffic.
p71
aVIn fact, when I became mayor,
p72
aVapplying that democratic principle
p73
aVthat public good prevails over private interest,
p74
aVthat a bus with 100 people
p75
aVhas a right to 100 times more road space than a car,
p76
aVwe implemented a mass transit system
p77
aVbased on buses in exclusive lanes.
p78
aVWe called it TransMilenio, in order to make buses sexier.
p79
aVAnd one thing is that it is also a very beautiful democratic symbol, because as buses zoom by,
p80
aVexpensive cars stuck in traffic,
p81
aVit clearly is almost a picture of democracy at work.
p82
aVIn fact, it's not just a matter of equity.
p83
aVIt doesn't take Ph.D.'s.
p84
aVA committee of 12-year-old children
p85
aVwould find out in 20 minutes
p86
aVthat the most efficient way to use scarce road space
p87
aVis with exclusive lanes for buses.
p88
aVIn fact, buses are not sexy,
p89
aVbut they are the only possible means
p90
aVto bring mass transit to all areas
p91
aVof fast growing developing cities.
p92
aVThey also have great capacity.
p93
aVFor example, this system in Guangzhou
p94
aVis moving more passengers our direction
p95
aVthan all subway lines in China,
p96
aVexcept for one line in Beijing,
p97
aVat a fraction of the cost.
p98
aa(lp99
VWe fought not just for space for buses,
p100
aVbut we fought for space for people,
p101
aVand that was even more difficult.
p102
aVCities are human habitats,
p103
aVand we humans are pedestrians.
p104
aVJust as fish need to swim or birds need to fly
p105
aVor deer need to run, we need to walk.
p106
aVThere is a really enormous conflict,
p107
aVwhen we are talking about developing country cities,
p108
aVbetween pedestrians and cars.
p109
aVHere, what you see is a picture that shows
p110
aVinsufficient democracy.
p111
aVWhat this shows is that people who walk
p112
aVare third-class citizens
p113
aVwhile those who go in cars
p114
aVare first-class citizens.
p115
aVIn terms of transport infrastructure,
p116
aVwhat really makes a difference
p117
aVbetween advanced and backward cities
p118
aVis not highways or subways
p119
aVbut quality sidewalks.
p120
aVHere they made a flyover, probably very useless,
p121
aVand they forgot to make a sidewalk.
p122
aVThis is prevailing all over the world.
p123
aVNot even schoolchildren are more important than cars.
p124
aa(lp125
VIn my city of Bogotá,
p126
aVwe fought a very difficult battle
p127
aVin order to take space from cars,
p128
aVwhich had been parking on sidewalks for decades,
p129
aVin order to make space for people that should reflect
p130
aVdignity of human beings,
p131
aVand to make space for protected bikeways.
p132
aVFirst of all, I had black hair before that.
p133
aV(Laughter)
p134
aVAnd I was almost impeached in the process.
p135
aVIt is a very difficult battle.
p136
aVHowever, it was possible, finally,
p137
aVafter very difficult battles, to make a city
p138
aVthat would reflect some respect for human dignity,
p139
aVthat would show that those who walk are equally
p140
aVimportant to those who have cars.
p141
aVIndeed, a very important ideological and political issue anywhere
p142
aVis how to distribute that most valuable resource
p143
aVof a city, which is road space.
p144
aVA city could find oil or diamonds underground
p145
aVand it would not be so valuable as road space.
p146
aVHow to distribute it between pedestrians,
p147
aVbicycles, public transport and cars?
p148
aVThis is not a technological issue,
p149
aVand we should remember that in no constitution
p150
aVparking is a constitutional right
p151
aVwhen we make that distribution.
p152
aa(lp153
VWe also built, and this was 15 years ago,
p154
aVbefore there were bikeways in New York
p155
aVor in Paris or in London,
p156
aVit was a very difficult battle as well,
p157
aVmore than 350 kilometers of protected bicycle ways.
p158
aVI don't think protected bicycle ways
p159
aVare a cute architectural feature.
p160
aVThey are a right, just as sidewalks are,
p161
aVunless we believe that only those
p162
aVwith access to a motor vehicle
p163
aVhave a right to safe mobility,
p164
aVwithout the risk of getting killed.
p165
aVAnd just as busways are,
p166
aVprotected bikeways also are
p167
aVa powerful symbol of democracy,
p168
aVbecause they show that a citizen on a $30 bicycle
p169
aVis equally important
p170
aVto one in a $30,000 car.
p171
aa(lp172
VAnd we are living in a unique moment in history.
p173
aVIn the next 50 years, more than half of those cities
p174
aVwhich will exist in the year 2060 will be built.
p175
aVIn many developing country cities,
p176
aVmore than 80 and 90 percent
p177
aVof the city which will exist in 2060
p178
aVwill be built over the next four or five decades.
p179
aa(lp180
VBut this is not just a matter for developing country cities.
p181
aVIn the United States, for example,
p182
aVmore than 70 million new homes
p183
aVmust be built over the next 40 or 50 years.
p184
aVThat's more than all the homes that today exist
p185
aVin Britain, France and Canada put together.
p186
aVAnd I believe that our cities today
p187
aVhave severe flaws,
p188
aVand that different, better ones could be built.
p189
aa(lp190
VWhat is wrong with our cities today?
p191
aVWell, for example, if we tell any three-year-old child
p192
aVwho is barely learning to speak
p193
aVin any city in the world today,
p194
aV"Watch out, a car,"
p195
aVthe child will jump in fright,
p196
aVand with a very good reason, because there are
p197
aVmore than 10,000 children who are killed
p198
aVby cars every year in the world.
p199
aVWe have had cities for 8,000 years,
p200
aVand children could walk out of home and play.
p201
aVIn fact, only very recently,
p202
aVtowards 1900, there were no cars.
p203
aVCars have been here for really less than 100 years.
p204
aVThey completely changed cities.
p205
aVIn 1900, for example,
p206
aVnobody was killed by cars in the United States.
p207
aVOnly 20 years later,
p208
aVbetween 1920 and 1930,
p209
aValmost 200,000 people
p210
aVwere killed by cars in the United States.
p211
aVOnly in 1925, almost 7,000 children
p212
aVwere killed by cars in the United States.
p213
aVSo we could make different cities,
p214
aVcities that will give more priority to human beings
p215
aVthan to cars, that will give more public space
p216
aVto human beings than to cars,
p217
aVcities which show great respect
p218
aVfor those most vulnerable citizens,
p219
aVsuch as children or the elderly.
p220
aa(lp221
VI will propose to you a couple of ingredients
p222
aVwhich I think would make cities much better,
p223
aVand it would be very simple to implement them
p224
aVin the new cities which are only being created.
p225
aVHundreds of kilometers of greenways
p226
aVcriss-crossing cities in all directions.
p227
aVChildren will walk out of homes into safe spaces.
p228
aVThey could go for dozens of kilometers safely
p229
aVwithout any risk in wonderful greenways,
p230
aVsort of bicycle highways,
p231
aVand I would invite you to imagine the following:
p232
aVa city in which every other street would be
p233
aVa street only for pedestrians and bicycles.
p234
aVIn new cities which are going to be built,
p235
aVthis would not be particularly difficult.
p236
aVWhen I was mayor of Bogotá,
p237
aVin only three years, we were able to create
p238
aV70 kilometers,
p239
aVin one of the most dense cities in the world,
p240
aVof these bicycle highways.
p241
aVAnd this changes the way people live,
p242
aVmove, enjoy the city.
p243
aVIn this picture, you see in one of the very poor neighborhoods,
p244
aVwe have a luxury pedestrian bicycle street,
p245
aVand the cars still in the mud.
p246
aVOf course, I would love to pave this street for cars.
p247
aVBut what do we do first?
p248
aVNinety-nine percent of the people in those neighborhoods don't have cars.
p249
aVBut you see, when a city is only being created,
p250
aVit's very easy to incorporate
p251
aVthis kind of infrastructure.
p252
aVThen the city grows around it.
p253
aVAnd of course this is just a glimpse
p254
aVof something which could be much better
p255
aVif we just create it,
p256
aVand it changes the way of life.
p257
aa(lp258
VAnd the second ingredient, which would solve mobility,
p259
aVthat very difficult challenge in developing countries,
p260
aVin a very low-cost and simple way,
p261
aVwould be to have hundreds of kilometers
p262
aVof streets only for buses,
p263
aVbuses and bicycles and pedestrians.
p264
aVThis would be, again, a very low-cost solution
p265
aVif implemented from the start,
p266
aVlow cost, pleasant transit
p267
aVwith natural sunlight.
p268
aa(lp269
VBut unfortunately, reality is not as good
p270
aVas my dreams.
p271
aVBecause of private property of land
p272
aVand high land prices,
p273
aVall developing country cities have a large problem of slums.
p274
aVIn my country of Colombia, almost half the homes
p275
aVin cities initially were illegal developments.
p276
aVAnd of course it's very difficult to have
p277
aVmass transit or to use bicycles in such environments.
p278
aVBut even legal developments
p279
aVhave also been located in the wrong places,
p280
aVvery far from the city centers
p281
aVwhere it's impossible to provide
p282
aVlow-cost, high-frequency public transport.
p283
aVAs a Latin American, and Latin America
p284
aVwas the most recently organized region in the world,
p285
aVI would recommend, respectfully, passionately,
p286
aVto those countries which are yet to urbanize \u2014
p287
aVLatin America went from 40 percent urban in 1950
p288
aVto 80 percent urban in 2010 \u2014
p289
aVI would recommend Asian and African countries
p290
aVwhich are yet to urbanize,
p291
aVsuch as India which is only 33 percent urban now,
p292
aVthat governments should acquire all land around cities.
p293
aVIn this way, their cities could grow in the right places
p294
aVwith the right spaces, with the parks,
p295
aVwith the greenways, with the busways.
p296
aa(lp297
VThe cities we are going to build
p298
aVover the next 50 years
p299
aVwill determine quality of life and even happiness
p300
aVfor billions of people towards the future.
p301
aVWhat a fantastic opportunity for leaders
p302
aVand many young leaders to come,
p303
aVespecially in the developing countries.
p304
aVThey can create a much happier life
p305
aVfor billions towards the future.
p306
aVI am sure, I am optimistic,
p307
aVthat they will make cities better
p308
aVthan our most ambitious dreams.
