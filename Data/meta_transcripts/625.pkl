(lp3
VIt's hard to believe that it's less than a year since the extraordinary moment
p4
aVwhen the finance, the credit, which drives our economies froze.
p5
aVA massive cardiac arrest.
p6
aVThe effect, the payback, perhaps, for years of vampire predators like Bernie Madoff,
p7
aVwhom we saw earlier.
p8
aVAbuse of steroids, binging and so on.
p9
aVAnd it's only a few months since governments
p10
aVinjected enormous sums of money to try and keep the whole system afloat.
p11
aVAnd we're now in a very strange sort of twilight zone,
p12
aVwhere no one quite knows what's worked, or what doesn't.
p13
aVWe don't have any very clear maps, any compass to guide us.
p14
aVWe don't know which experts to believe anymore.
p15
aa(lp16
VWhat I'm going to try and do is to give some pointers
p17
aVto what I think is the landscape on the other side of the crisis,
p18
aVwhat things we should be looking out for
p19
aVand how we can actually use the crisis.
p20
aVThere's a definition of leadership which says,
p21
aV"It's the ability to use the smallest possible crisis
p22
aVfor the biggest possible effect."
p23
aVAnd I want to talk about how we ensure that this crisis,
p24
aVwhich is by no means small, really is used to the full.
p25
aa(lp26
VI want to start just by saying a bit about where I'm coming from.
p27
aVI've got a very confused background
p28
aVwhich perhaps makes me appropriate for confused times.
p29
aVI've got a Ph.D. in Telecoms, as you can see.
p30
aVI trained briefly as a Buddhist monk under this guy.
p31
aVI've been a civil servant,
p32
aVand I've been in charge of policy for this guy as well.
p33
aa(lp34
VBut what I want to talk about begins when I was at this city, this university, as a student.
p35
aVAnd then as now, it was a beautiful place of balls and punts, beautiful people,
p36
aVmany of whom took to heart Ronald Reagan's comment
p37
aVthat, "even if they say hard work doesn't do you any harm,
p38
aVwhy risk it?"
p39
aa(lp40
VBut when I was here,
p41
aVa lot of my fellow teenagers were in a very different situation,
p42
aVleaving school at a time then of rapidly growing youth unemployment,
p43
aVand essentially hitting a brick wall in terms of their opportunities.
p44
aVAnd I spent quite a lot of time with them rather than in punts.
p45
aVAnd they were people who were not short of wit, or grace or energy,
p46
aVbut they had no hope, no jobs, no prospects.
p47
aVAnd when people aren't allowed to be useful,
p48
aVthey soon think that they're useless.
p49
aVAnd although that was great for the music business at the time,
p50
aVit wasn't much good for anything else.
p51
aVAnd ever since then, I've wondered why it is that capitalism
p52
aVis so amazingly efficient at some things, but so inefficient at others,
p53
aVwhy it's so innovative in some ways and so un-innovative in others.
p54
aa(lp55
VNow, since that time,
p56
aVwe've actually been through an extraordinary boom,
p57
aVthe longest boom ever in the history of this country.
p58
aVUnprecedented wealth and prosperity,
p59
aVbut that growth hasn't always delivered what we needed.
p60
aVH.L. Mencken once said that, "to every complex problem,
p61
aVthere is a simple solution and it's wrong."
p62
aVBut I'm not saying growth is wrong,
p63
aVbut it's very striking that throughout the years of growth,
p64
aVmany things didn't get better.
p65
aVRates of depression carried on up, right across the Western world.
p66
aVIf you look at America, the proportion of Americans
p67
aVwith no one to talk to about important things
p68
aVwent up from a tenth to a quarter.
p69
aVWe commuted longer to work, but as you can see from this graph,
p70
aVthe longer you commute the less happy you're likely to be.
p71
aVAnd it became ever clearer that economic growth
p72
aVdoesn't automatically translate into social growth or human growth.
p73
aa(lp74
VWe're now at another moment
p75
aVwhen another wave of teenagers are entering a cruel job market.
p76
aVThere will be a million unemployed young people here
p77
aVby the end of the year,
p78
aVthousands losing their jobs everyday in America.
p79
aVWe've got to do whatever we can to help them,
p80
aVbut we've also got to ask, I think, a more profound question
p81
aVof whether we use this crisis to jump forward
p82
aVto a different kind of economy that's more suited to human needs,
p83
aVto a better balance of economy and society.
p84
aa(lp85
VAnd I think one of the lessons of history is that
p86
aVeven the deepest crises can be moments of opportunity.
p87
aVThey bring ideas from the margins into the mainstream.
p88
aVThey often lead to the acceleration of much-needed reforms.
p89
aVAnd you saw that in the '30s,
p90
aVwhen the Great Depression paved the way
p91
aVfor Bretton Woods, welfare states and so on.
p92
aVAnd I think you can see around us now,
p93
aVsome of the green shoots of a very different kind of economy and capitalism
p94
aVwhich could grow.
p95
aVYou can see it in daily life.
p96
aVWhen times are hard, people have to do things for themselves,
p97
aVand right across the world, Oxford, Omaha, Omsk,
p98
aVyou can see an extraordinary explosion of urban farming,
p99
aVpeople taking over land, taking over roofs,
p100
aVturning barges into temporary farms.
p101
aa(lp102
VAnd I'm a very small part of this.
p103
aVI have 60,000 of these things in my garden.
p104
aVA few of these. This is Atilla the hen.
p105
aVAnd I'm a very small part of a very large movement,
p106
aVwhich for some people is about survival,
p107
aVbut is also about values, about a different kind of economy,
p108
aVwhich isn't so much about consumption and credit,
p109
aVbut about things which matter to us.
p110
aVAnd everywhere too, you can see a proliferation of time banks
p111
aVand parallel currencies,
p112
aVpeople using smart technologies to link up
p113
aVall the resources freed up by the market \u2014 people, buildings, land \u2014
p114
aVand linking them to whomever has got the most compelling needs.
p115
aa(lp116
VThere's a similar story, I think, for governments.
p117
aVRonald Reagan, again, said the two funniest sentences
p118
aVin the English language are,
p119
aV"I'm from the government. And I'm here to help."
p120
aVBut I think last year when governments did step in,
p121
aVpeople were quite glad that they were there, that they did act.
p122
aVBut now, a few months on,
p123
aVhowever good politicians are at swallowing frogs
p124
aVwithout pulling a face, as someone once put it,
p125
aVthey can't hide their uncertainty.
p126
aVBecause it's already clear
p127
aVhow much of the enormous amount of money they put into the economy,
p128
aVreally went into fixing the past, bailing out the banks, the car companies,
p129
aVnot preparing us for the future.
p130
aVHow much of the money is going into concrete and boosting consumption,
p131
aVnot into solving the really profound problems we have to solve.
p132
aa(lp133
VAnd everywhere, as people think about the unprecedented sums
p134
aVwhich are being spent of our money and our children's money,
p135
aVnow, in the depth of this crisis, they're asking:
p136
aVSurely, we should be using this with a longer-term vision
p137
aVto accelerate the shift to a green economy,
p138
aVto prepare for aging, to deal with some of the inequalities
p139
aVwhich scar countries like this and the United States
p140
aVrather than just giving the money to the incumbents?
p141
aVSurely, we should be giving the money to entrepreneurs, to civil society,
p142
aVfor people able to create the new,
p143
aVnot to the big, well-connected companies,
p144
aVbig, clunky government programs.
p145
aVAnd, after all this, as the great Chinese sage Lao Tzu said,
p146
aV"Governing a great country is like cooking a small fish.
p147
aVDon't overdo it."
p148
aa(lp149
VAnd I think more and more people are also asking:
p150
aVWhy boost consumption, rather than change what we consume?
p151
aVLike the mayor of São Paulo who's banned advertising billboards,
p152
aVor the many cities like San Francisco
p153
aVputting in infrastructures for electric cars.
p154
aVYou can see a bit of the same thing happening in the business world.
p155
aVSome, I think some of the bankers
p156
aVwho have appear to have learned nothing and forgotten nothing.
p157
aVBut ask yourselves: What will be the biggest sectors of the economy
p158
aVin 10, 20, 30 years time? It won't be the ones lining up for handouts,
p159
aVlike cars and aerospace and so on.
p160
aa(lp161
VThe biggest sector, by far, will be health \u2014
p162
aValready 18 percent of the American economy,
p163
aVpredicted to grow to 30, even 40 percent by mid-century.
p164
aVElder care, child care, already much bigger employers than cars.
p165
aVEducation: six, seven, eight percent of the economy and growing.
p166
aVEnvironmental services, energy services, the myriad of green jobs,
p167
aVthey're all pointing to a very different kind of economy
p168
aVwhich isn't just about products, but is using distributed networks,
p169
aVand it's founded above all on care, on relationships,
p170
aVon what people do to other people, often one to one,
p171
aVrather than simply selling them a product.
p172
aa(lp173
VAnd I think that what connects the challenge for civil society,
p174
aVthe challenge for governments and the challenge for business now
p175
aVis, in a way, a very simple one, but quite a difficult one.
p176
aVWe know our societies have to radically change.
p177
aVWe know we can't go back to where we were before the crisis.
p178
aVBut we also know it's only through experiment
p179
aVthat we'll discover exactly how to run a low carbon city,
p180
aVhow to care for a much older population,
p181
aVhow to deal with drug addiction and so on.
p182
aa(lp183
VAnd here's the problem.
p184
aVIn science, we do experiments systematically.
p185
aVOur societies now spend two, three, four percent of GDP
p186
aVto invest systematically in new discovery, in science, in technology,
p187
aVto fuel the pipeline of brilliant inventions
p188
aVwhich illuminate gatherings like this.
p189
aVIt's not that our scientists are necessarily much smarter
p190
aVthan they were a hundred years ago, maybe they are,
p191
aVbut they have a hell of a lot more backing than they ever did.
p192
aVAnd what's striking though,
p193
aVis that in society there's almost nothing comparable,
p194
aVno comparable investment,
p195
aVno systematic experiment, in the things capitalism isn't very good at,
p196
aVlike compassion, or empathy, or relationships or care.
p197
aa(lp198
VNow, I didn't really understand that until I met this guy
p199
aVwho was then an 80-year-old, slightly shambolic man
p200
aVwho lived on tomato soup and thought ironing was very overrated.
p201
aVHe had helped shape Britain's post-war institutions,
p202
aVits welfare state, its economy,
p203
aVbut had sort of reinvented himself as a social entrepreneur,
p204
aVbecame an inventor of many, many different organizations.
p205
aVSome famous ones like the Open University, which has 110,000 students,
p206
aVthe University of the Third Age, which has nearly half a million older people
p207
aVteaching other older people,
p208
aVas well as strange things like DIY garages and language lines
p209
aVand schools for social entrepreneurs.
p210
aVAnd he ended his life selling companies to venture capitalists.
p211
aa(lp212
VHe believed if you see a problem, you shouldn't tell someone to act,
p213
aVyou should act on it yourself, and he lived long enough
p214
aVand saw enough of his ideas first scorned and then succeed
p215
aVthat he said you should always take no as a question and not as an answer.
p216
aVAnd his life was a systematic experiment to find better social answers,
p217
aVnot from a theory, but from experiment, and experiment involving the people
p218
aVwith the best intelligence on social needs,
p219
aVwhich were usually the people living with those needs.
p220
aVAnd he believed we live with others, we share the world with others
p221
aVand therefore our innovation must be done with others too,
p222
aVnot doing things at people, for them, and so on.
p223
aa(lp224
VNow, what he did didn't used to have a name,
p225
aVbut I think it's rapidly becoming quite mainstream.
p226
aVIt's what we do in the organization named after him
p227
aVwhere we try and invent, create, launch new ventures,
p228
aVwhether it's schools, web companies, health organizations and so on.
p229
aVAnd we find ourselves part of a very rapidly growing global movement
p230
aVof institutions working on social innovation,
p231
aVusing ideas from design or technology or community organizing
p232
aVto develop the germs of a future world, but through practice and through demonstration
p233
aVand not through theory.
p234
aVAnd they're spreading from Korea to Brazil to India to the USA
p235
aVand across Europe.
p236
aVAnd they've been given new momentum by the crisis, by the need for better answers
p237
aVto joblessness, community breakdown and so on.
p238
aa(lp239
VSome of the ideas are strange.
p240
aVThese are complaints choirs.
p241
aVPeople come together to sing about the things that really bug them.
p242
aV(Laughter)
p243
aVOthers are much more pragmatic: health coaches, learning mentors, job clubs.
p244
aVAnd some are quite structural, like social impact bonds
p245
aVwhere you raise money to invest in diverting teenagers from crime
p246
aVor helping old people keep out of hospital,
p247
aVand you get paid back according to how successful your projects are.
p248
aa(lp249
VNow, the idea that all of this represents,
p250
aVI think, is rapidly becoming a common sense
p251
aVand part of how we respond to the crisis,
p252
aVrecognizing the need to invest in innovation for social progress
p253
aVas well as technological progress.
p254
aVThere were big health innovation funds
p255
aVlaunched earlier this year in this country,
p256
aVas well as a public service innovation lab.
p257
aVAcross northern Europe, many governments
p258
aVnow have innovation laboratories within them.
p259
aVAnd just a few months ago, President Obama
p260
aVlaunched the Office of Social Innovation in the White House.
p261
aa(lp262
VAnd what people are beginning to ask is:
p263
aVSurely, just as we invest in R and D, two, three, four percent,
p264
aVof our GDP, of our economy,
p265
aVwhat if we put, let's say, one percent of public spending
p266
aVinto social innovation, into elder care, new kinds of education,
p267
aVnew ways of helping the disabled?
p268
aVPerhaps we'd achieve similar productivity gains in society
p269
aVto those we've had in the economy and in technology.
p270
aa(lp271
VAnd if, a generation or two ago, the big challenges
p272
aVwere ones like getting a man on the moon,
p273
aVperhaps the challenges we need to set ourselves now
p274
aVare ones like eliminating child malnutrition, stopping trafficking,
p275
aVor one, I think closer to home for America or Europe,
p276
aVwhy don't we set ourselves the goal
p277
aVof achieving a billion extra years of life for today's citizens.
p278
aVNow those are all goals which could be achieved within a decade,
p279
aVbut only with radical and systematic experiment,
p280
aVnot just with technologies, but also with lifestyles and culture
p281
aVand policies and institutions too.
p282
aa(lp283
VNow, I want to end by saying a little bit about what I think this means for capitalism.
p284
aVI think what this is all about, this whole movement
p285
aVwhich is growing from the margins, remains quite small.
p286
aVNothing like the resources of a CERN or a DARPA or an IBM or a Dupont.
p287
aVWhat it's telling us is that capitalism is going to become more social.
p288
aVIt's already immersed in social networks.
p289
aVIt will become more involved in social investment, and social care
p290
aVand in industries where the value comes from what you do with others,
p291
aVnot just from what you sell to them,
p292
aVand from relationships as well as from consumption.
p293
aVBut interestingly too, it implies a future where society learns a few tricks from capitalism
p294
aVabout how you embed the DNA of restless continual innovation
p295
aVinto society, trying things out and then growing and scaling the ones that work.
p296
aa(lp297
VNow, I think this future will be quite surprising to many people.
p298
aVIn recent years, a lot of intelligent people thought that capitalism had basically won.
p299
aVHistory was over
p300
aVand society would inevitably have to take second place to economy.
p301
aVBut I've been struck with a parallel in how people often talk about capitalism today
p302
aVand how they talked about the monarchy 200 years ago,
p303
aVjust after the French Revolution and the restoration of the monarchy in France.
p304
aa(lp305
VThen, people said monarchy dominated everywhere
p306
aVbecause it was rooted in human nature.
p307
aVWe were naturally deferential. We needed hierarchy.
p308
aVJust as today, the enthusiasts of unrestrained capitalism
p309
aVsay it's rooted in human nature,
p310
aVonly now it's individualism, inquisitiveness, and so on.
p311
aVThen monarchy had seen off its big challenger, mass democracy,
p312
aVwhich was seen as a well-intentioned but doomed experiment,
p313
aVjust as capitalism has seen off socialism.
p314
aVEven Fidel Castro now says that the only thing worse
p315
aVthan being exploited by multinational capitalism
p316
aVis not being exploited by multinational capitalism.
p317
aVAnd whereas then monarchies, palaces and forts dominated every city skyline
p318
aVand looked permanent and confident,
p319
aVtoday it's the gleaming towers of the banks which dominate every big city.
p320
aa(lp321
VI'm not suggesting the crowds are about to storm the barricades
p322
aVand string up every investment banker from the nearest lamppost,
p323
aVthough that might be quite tempting.
p324
aVBut I do think we're on the verge of a period when,
p325
aVjust as happened to the monarchy and, interestingly, the military too,
p326
aVthe central position of finance capital is going to come to an end,
p327
aVand it's going to steadily move to the sides, the margins of our society,
p328
aVtransformed from being a master into a servant,
p329
aVa servant to the productive economy and of human needs.
p330
aa(lp331
VAnd as that happens,
p332
aVwe will remember something very simple and obvious about capitalism,
p333
aVwhich is that, unlike what you read in economics textbooks,
p334
aVit's not a self-sufficient system.
p335
aVIt depends on other systems,
p336
aVon ecology, on family, on community,
p337
aVand if these aren't replenished, capitalism suffers too.
p338
aVAnd our human nature isn't just selfish, it's also compassionate.
p339
aVIt's not just competitive, it's also caring.
p340
aVBecause of the depth of the crisis, I think we are at a moment of choice.
p341
aa(lp342
VThe crisis is almost certainly deepening around us.
p343
aVIt will be worse at the end of this year,
p344
aVquite possibly worse in a year's time than it is today.
p345
aVBut this is one of those very rare moments
p346
aVwhen we have to choose whether we're just pedaling furiously
p347
aVto get back to where we were a year or two ago,
p348
aVand a very narrow idea of what the economy is for,
p349
aVor whether this is a moment to jump ahead, to reboot
p350
aVand to do some of the things we probably should have been doing anyway.
p351
