VTonight, I want to have a conversation about
p4
aVthis incredible global issue
p5
aVthat's at the intersection of land use, food and environment,
p6
aVsomething we can all relate to,
p7
aVand what I've been calling the other inconvenient truth.
p8
aa(lp9
VBut first, I want to take you on a little journey.
p10
aVLet's first visit our planet, but at night,
p11
aVand from space.
p12
aVThis is what our planet looks like from outer space
p13
aVat nighttime, if you were to take a satellite and travel
p14
aVaround the planet. And the thing you would notice first,
p15
aVof course, is how dominant the human presence
p16
aVon our planet is.
p17
aVWe see cities, we see oil fields,
p18
aVyou can even make out fishing fleets in the sea,
p19
aVthat we are dominating much of our planet,
p20
aVand mostly through the use of energy
p21
aVthat we see here at night.
p22
aVBut let's go back and drop it a little deeper
p23
aVand look during the daytime.
p24
aVWhat we see during the day is our landscapes.
p25
aa(lp26
VThis is part of the Amazon Basin, a place called Rondônia
p27
aVin the south-center part of the Brazilian Amazon.
p28
aVIf you look really carefully in the upper right-hand corner,
p29
aVyou're going to see a thin white line,
p30
aVwhich is a road that was built in the 1970s.
p31
aVIf we come back to the same place in 2001,
p32
aVwhat we're going to find is that these roads
p33
aVspurt off more roads, and more roads after that,
p34
aVat the end of which is a small clearing in the rainforest
p35
aVwhere there are going to be a few cows.
p36
aVThese cows are used for beef. We're going to eat these cows.
p37
aVAnd these cows are eaten basically in South America,
p38
aVin Brazil and Argentina. They're not being shipped up here.
p39
aVBut this kind of fishbone pattern of deforestation
p40
aVis something we notice a lot of around the tropics,
p41
aVespecially in this part of the world.
p42
aa(lp43
VIf we go a little bit further south in our little tour of the world,
p44
aVwe can go to the Bolivian edge of the Amazon,
p45
aVhere also in 1975, and if you look really carefully,
p46
aVthere's a thin white line through that kind of seam,
p47
aVand there's a lone farmer out there
p48
aVin the middle of the primeval jungle.
p49
aVLet's come back again a few years later, here in 2003,
p50
aVand we'll see that that landscape actually looks
p51
aVa lot more like Iowa than it does like a rainforest.
p52
aVIn fact, what you're seeing here are soybean fields.
p53
aVThese soybeans are being shipped to Europe and to China
p54
aVas animal feed, especially after the mad cow disease scare
p55
aVabout a decade ago, where we don't want to feed animals
p56
aVanimal protein anymore, because that can transmit disease.
p57
aVInstead, we want to feed them more vegetable proteins.
p58
aVSo soybeans have really exploded,
p59
aVshowing how trade and globalization are
p60
aVreally responsible for the connections to rainforests
p61
aVand the Amazon \u2014 an incredibly strange
p62
aVand interconnected world that we have today.
p63
aa(lp64
VWell, again and again, what we find as we look
p65
aVaround the world in our little tour of the world
p66
aVis that landscape after landscape after landscape
p67
aVhave been cleared and altered for growing food
p68
aVand other crops.
p69
aa(lp70
VSo one of the questions we've been asking is,
p71
aVhow much of the world is used to grow food,
p72
aVand where is it exactly, and how can we change that
p73
aVinto the future, and what does it mean?
p74
aVWell, our team has been looking at this on a global scale,
p75
aVusing satellite data and ground-based data kind of to track
p76
aVfarming on a global scale.
p77
aVAnd this is what we found, and it's startling.
p78
aVThis map shows the presence of agriculture
p79
aVon planet Earth.
p80
aVThe green areas are the areas we use to grow crops,
p81
aVlike wheat or soybeans or corn or rice or whatever.
p82
aVThat's 16 million square kilometers' worth of land.
p83
aVIf you put it all together in one place,
p84
aVit'd be the size of South America.
p85
aVThe second area, in brown, is the world's pastures
p86
aVand rangelands, where our animals live.
p87
aVThat area's about 30 million square kilometers,
p88
aVor about an Africa's worth of land,
p89
aVa huge amount of land, and it's the best land, of course,
p90
aVis what you see. And what's left is, like,
p91
aVthe middle of the Sahara Desert, or Siberia,
p92
aVor the middle of a rain forest.
p93
aVWe're using a planet's worth of land already.
p94
aVIf we look at this carefully, we find it's about 40 percent
p95
aVof the Earth's land surface is devoted to agriculture,
p96
aVand it's 60 times larger
p97
aVthan all the areas we complain about,
p98
aVour suburban sprawl and our cities where we mostly live.
p99
aVHalf of humanity lives in cities today,
p100
aVbut a 60-times-larger area is used to grow food.
p101
aVSo this is an amazing kind of result,
p102
aVand it really shocked us when we looked at that.
p103
aa(lp104
VSo we're using an enormous amount of land for agriculture,
p105
aVbut also we're using a lot of water.
p106
aVThis is a photograph flying into Arizona,
p107
aVand when you look at it, you're like,
p108
aV"What are they growing here?" It turns out
p109
aVthey're growing lettuce in the middle of the desert
p110
aVusing water sprayed on top.
p111
aVNow, the irony is, it's probably sold
p112
aVin our supermarket shelves in the Twin Cities.
p113
aVBut what's really interesting is, this water's got to come
p114
aVfrom some place, and it comes from here,
p115
aVthe Colorado River in North America.
p116
aVWell, the Colorado on a typical day in the 1950s,
p117
aVthis is just, you know, not a flood, not a drought,
p118
aVkind of an average day, it looks something like this.
p119
aVBut if we come back today, during a normal condition
p120
aVto the exact same location, this is what's left.
p121
aVThe difference is mainly irrigating the desert for food,
p122
aVor maybe golf courses in Scottsdale, you take your pick.
p123
aVWell, this is a lot of water, and again, we're mining water
p124
aVand using it to grow food,
p125
aVand today, if you travel down further down the Colorado,
p126
aVit dries up completely and no longer flows into the ocean.
p127
aVWe've literally consumed an entire river in North America
p128
aVfor irrigation.
p129
aa(lp130
VWell, that's not even the worst example in the world.
p131
aVThis probably is: the Aral Sea.
p132
aVNow, a lot you will remember this from your geography classes.
p133
aVThis is in the former Soviet Union
p134
aVin between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan,
p135
aVone of the great inland seas of the world.
p136
aVBut there's kind of a paradox here, because it looks like
p137
aVit's surrounded by desert. Why is this sea here?
p138
aVThe reason it's here is because, on the right-hand side,
p139
aVyou see two little rivers kind of coming down
p140
aVthrough the sand, feeding this basin with water.
p141
aVThose rivers are draining snowmelt from mountains
p142
aVfar to the east, where snow melts, it travels down the river
p143
aVthrough the desert, and forms the great Aral Sea.
p144
aVWell, in the 1950s, the Soviets decided to divert that water
p145
aVto irrigate the desert to grow cotton, believe it or not,
p146
aVin Kazakhstan, to sell cotton to the international markets
p147
aVto bring foreign currency into the Soviet Union.
p148
aVThey really needed the money.
p149
aVWell, you can imagine what happens. You turn off
p150
aVthe water supply to the Aral Sea, what's going to happen?
p151
aVHere it is in 1973,
p152
aV1986,
p153
aV1999,
p154
aV2004,
p155
aVand about 11 months ago.
p156
aVIt's pretty extraordinary.
p157
aVNow a lot of us in the audience here live in the Midwest.
p158
aVImagine that was Lake Superior.
p159
aVImagine that was Lake Huron.
p160
aVIt's an extraordinary change.
p161
aa(lp162
VThis is not only a change in water and
p163
aVwhere the shoreline is, this is a change in the fundamentals
p164
aVof the environment of this region.
p165
aVLet's start with this.
p166
aVThe Soviet Union didn't really have a Sierra Club.
p167
aVLet's put it that way.
p168
aVSo what you find in the bottom of the Aral Sea ain't pretty.
p169
aVThere's a lot of toxic waste, a lot of things
p170
aVthat were dumped there that are now becoming airborne.
p171
aVOne of those small islands that was remote
p172
aVand impossible to get to was a site
p173
aVof Soviet biological weapons testing.
p174
aVYou can walk there today.
p175
aVWeather patterns have changed.
p176
aVNineteen of the unique 20 fish species found only
p177
aVin the Aral Sea are now wiped off the face of the Earth.
p178
aVThis is an environmental disaster writ large.
p179
aa(lp180
VBut let's bring it home.
p181
aVThis is a picture that Al Gore gave me a few years ago
p182
aVthat he took when he was in the Soviet Union
p183
aVa long, long time ago,
p184
aVshowing the fishing fleets of the Aral Sea.
p185
aVYou see the canal they dug?
p186
aVThey were so desperate to try to, kind of, float the boats into
p187
aVthe remaining pools of water, but they finally had to give up
p188
aVbecause the piers and the moorings simply couldn't
p189
aVkeep up with the retreating shoreline.
p190
aVI don't know about you, but I'm terrified that future
p191
aVarchaeologists will dig this up and write stories about
p192
aVour time in history, and wonder, "What were you thinking?"
p193
aVWell, that's the future we have to look forward to.
p194
aa(lp195
VWe already use about 50 percent of the Earth's fresh water
p196
aVthat's sustainable, and agriculture alone
p197
aVis 70 percent of that.
p198
aVSo we use a lot of water, a lot of land for agriculture.
p199
aVWe also use a lot of the atmosphere for agriculture.
p200
aVUsually when we think about the atmosphere,
p201
aVwe think about climate change and greenhouse gases,
p202
aVand mostly around energy,
p203
aVbut it turns out agriculture is one of the biggest emitters
p204
aVof greenhouse gases too.
p205
aVIf you look at carbon dioxide from
p206
aVburning tropical rainforest,
p207
aVor methane coming from cows and rice,
p208
aVor nitrous oxide from too many fertilizers,
p209
aVit turns out agriculture is 30 percent of the greenhouse
p210
aVgases going into the atmosphere from human activity.
p211
aVThat's more than all our transportation.
p212
aVIt's more than all our electricity.
p213
aVIt's more than all other manufacturing, in fact.
p214
aVIt's the single largest emitter of greenhouse gases
p215
aVof any human activity in the world.
p216
aVAnd yet, we don't talk about it very much.
p217
aa(lp218
VSo we have this incredible presence today of agriculture
p219
aVdominating our planet,
p220
aVwhether it's 40 percent of our land surface,
p221
aV70 percent of the water we use,
p222
aV30 percent of our greenhouse gas emissions.
p223
aVWe've doubled the flows of nitrogen and phosphorus
p224
aVaround the world simply by using fertilizers,
p225
aVcausing huge problems of water quality from rivers,
p226
aVlakes, and even oceans, and it's also the single biggest
p227
aVdriver of biodiversity loss.
p228
aVSo without a doubt, agriculture is
p229
aVthe single most powerful force unleashed on this planet
p230
aVsince the end of the ice age. No question.
p231
aVAnd it rivals climate change in importance.
p232
aVAnd they're both happening at the same time.
p233
aa(lp234
VBut what's really important here to remember is that
p235
aVit's not all bad. It's not that agriculture's a bad thing.
p236
aVIn fact, we completely depend on it.
p237
aVIt's not optional. It's not a luxury. It's an absolute necessity.
p238
aVWe have to provide food and feed and, yeah,
p239
aVfiber and even biofuels to something like seven billion people
p240
aVin the world today, and if anything,
p241
aVwe're going to have the demands on agriculture
p242
aVincrease into the future. It's not going to go away.
p243
aVIt's going to get a lot bigger, mainly because of
p244
aVgrowing population. We're seven billion people today
p245
aVheading towards at least nine,
p246
aVprobably nine and a half before we're done.
p247
aVMore importantly, changing diets.
p248
aVAs the world becomes wealthier as well as more populous,
p249
aVwe're seeing increases in dietary consumption of meat,
p250
aVwhich take a lot more resources than a vegetarian diet does.
p251
aVSo more people, eating more stuff, and richer stuff,
p252
aVand of course having an energy crisis at the same time,
p253
aVwhere we have to replace oil with other energy sources
p254
aVthat will ultimately have to include some kinds of biofuels
p255
aVand bio-energy sources.
p256
aVSo you put these together. It's really hard to see
p257
aVhow we're going to get to the rest of the century
p258
aVwithout at least doubling global agricultural production.
p259
aa(lp260
VWell, how are we going to do this? How are going to
p261
aVdouble global ag production around the world?
p262
aa(lp263
VWell, we could try to farm more land.
p264
aVThis is an analysis we've done, where on the left is where
p265
aVthe crops are today, on the right is where they could be
p266
aVbased on soils and climate, assuming climate change
p267
aVdoesn't disrupt too much of this,
p268
aVwhich is not a good assumption.
p269
aVWe could farm more land, but the problem is
p270
aVthe remaining lands are in sensitive areas.
p271
aVThey have a lot of biodiversity, a lot of carbon,
p272
aVthings we want to protect.
p273
aVSo we could grow more food by expanding farmland,
p274
aVbut we'd better not,
p275
aVbecause it's ecologically a very, very dangerous thing to do.
p276
aa(lp277
VInstead, we maybe want to freeze the footprint
p278
aVof agriculture and farm the lands we have better.
p279
aVThis is work that we're doing to try to highlight places
p280
aVin the world where we could improve yields
p281
aVwithout harming the environment.
p282
aVThe green areas here show where corn yields,
p283
aVjust showing corn as an example,
p284
aVare already really high, probably the maximum you could
p285
aVfind on Earth today for that climate and soil,
p286
aVbut the brown areas and yellow areas are places where
p287
aVwe're only getting maybe 20 or 30 percent of the yield
p288
aVyou should be able to get.
p289
aVYou see a lot of this in Africa, even Latin America,
p290
aVbut interestingly, Eastern Europe, where Soviet Union
p291
aVand Eastern Bloc countries used to be,
p292
aVis still a mess agriculturally.
p293
aVNow, this would require nutrients and water.
p294
aVIt's going to either be organic or conventional
p295
aVor some mix of the two to deliver that.
p296
aVPlants need water and nutrients.
p297
aVBut we can do this, and there are opportunities to make this work.
p298
aa(lp299
VBut we have to do it in a way that is sensitive
p300
aVto meeting the food security needs of the future
p301
aVand the environmental security needs of the future.
p302
aVWe have to figure out how to make this tradeoff between
p303
aVgrowing food and having a healthy environment work better.
p304
aa(lp305
VRight now, it's kind of an all-or-nothing proposition.
p306
aVWe can grow food in the background \u2014
p307
aVthat's a soybean field \u2014
p308
aVand in this flower diagram, it shows we grow a lot of food,
p309
aVbut we don't have a lot clean water, we're not storing
p310
aVa lot of carbon, we don't have a lot of biodiversity.
p311
aVIn the foreground, we have this prairie
p312
aVthat's wonderful from the environmental side,
p313
aVbut you can't eat anything. What's there to eat?
p314
aVWe need to figure out how to bring both of those together
p315
aVinto a new kind of agriculture that brings them all together.
p316
aa(lp317
VNow, when I talk about this, people often tell me,
p318
aV"Well, isn't blank the answer?" \u2014 organic food,
p319
aVlocal food, GMOs, new trade subsidies, new farm bills \u2014
p320
aVand yeah, we have a lot of good ideas here,
p321
aVbut not any one of these is a silver bullet.
p322
aVIn fact, what I think they are is more like silver buckshot.
p323
aVAnd I love silver buckshot. You put it together
p324
aVand you've got something really powerful,
p325
aVbut we need to put them together.
p326
aa(lp327
VSo what we have to do, I think, is invent a new kind
p328
aVof agriculture that blends the best ideas
p329
aVof commercial agriculture and the green revolution
p330
aVwith the best ideas of organic farming and local food
p331
aVand the best ideas of environmental conservation,
p332
aVnot to have them fighting each other but to have them
p333
aVcollaborating together to form a new kind of agriculture,
p334
aVsomething I call "terraculture," or farming for a whole planet.
p335
aa(lp336
VNow, having this conversation has been really hard,
p337
aVand we've been trying very hard to bring these key points
p338
aVto people to reduce the controversy,
p339
aVto increase the collaboration.
p340
aVI want to show you a short video that does kind of show
p341
aVour efforts right now to bring these sides together
p342
aVinto a single conversation. So let me show you that.
p343
aV(Music)
p344
aV("Institute on the Environment, University of Minnesota: Driven to Discover")
p345
aV(Music)
p346
aV("The world population is growing
p347
aVby 75 million people each year.
p348
aVThat's almost the size of Germany.
p349
aVToday, we're nearing 7 billion people.
p350
aVAt this rate, we'll reach 9 billion people by 2040.
p351
aVAnd we all need food.
p352
aVBut how?
p353
aVHow do we feed a growing world without destroying the planet?
p354
aVWe already know climate change is a big problem.
p355
aVBut it's not the only problem.
p356
aVWe need to face 'the other inconvenient truth.'
p357
aVA global crisis in agriculture.
p358
aVPopulation growth + meat consumption + dairy consumption + energy costs + bioenergy production = stress on natural resources.
p359
aVMore than 40% of Earth's land has been cleared for agriculture.
p360
aVGlobal croplands cover 16 million km².
p361
aVThat's almost the size of South America.
p362
aVGlobal pastures cover 30 million km².
p363
aVThat's the size of Africa.
p364
aVAgriculture uses 60 times more land than urban and suburban areas combined.
p365
aVIrrigation is the biggest use of water on the planet.
p366
aVWe use 2,800 cubic kilometers of water on crops every year.
p367
aVThat's enough to fill 7,305 Empire State Buildings every day.
p368
aVToday, many large rivers have reduced flows.
p369
aVSome dry up altogether.
p370
aVLook at the Aral Sea, now turned to desert.
p371
aVOr the Colorado River, which no longer flows to the ocean.
p372
aVFertilizers have more than doubled the phosphorus and nitrogen in the environment.
p373
aVThe consequence?
p374
aVWidespread water pollution
p375
aVand massive degradation of lakes and rivers.
p376
aVSurprisingly, agriculture is the biggest contributor to climate change.
p377
aVIt generates 30% of greenhouse gas emissions.
p378
aVThat's more than the emissions from all electricity and industry,
p379
aVor from all the world's planes, trains and automobiles.
p380
aVMost agricultural emissions come from tropical deforestation,
p381
aVmethane from animals and rice fields,
p382
aVand nitrous oxide from over-fertilizing.
p383
aVThere is nothing we do that transforms the world more than agriculture.
p384
aVAnd there's nothing we do that is more crucial to our survival.
p385
aVHere's the dilemma...
p386
aVAs the world grows by several billion more people,
p387
aVWe'll need to double, maybe even triple, global food production.
p388
aVSo where do we go from here?
p389
aVWe need a bigger conversation, an international dialogue.
p390
aVWe need to invest in real solutions:
p391
aVincentives for farmers, precision agriculture, new crop varieties, drip irrigation,
p392
aVgray water recycling, better tillage practices, smarter diets.
p393
aVWe need everyone at the table.
p394
aVAdvocates of commercial agriculture,
p395
aVenvironmental conservation,
p396
aVand organic farming...
p397
aVmust work together.
p398
aVThere is no single solution.
p399
aVWe need collaboration,
p400
aVimagination,
p401
aVdetermination,
p402
aVbecause failure is not an option.
p403
aVHow do we feed the world without destroying it?
p404
aVYeah, so we face one of the greatest grand challenges
p405
aVin all of human history today:
p406
aVthe need to feed nine billion people
p407
aVand do so sustainably and equitably and justly,
p408
aVat the same time protecting our planet
p409
aVfor this and future generations.
p410
aVThis is going to be one of the hardest things
p411
aVwe ever have done in human history,
p412
aVand we absolutely have to get it right,
p413
aVand we have to get it right on our first and only try.
