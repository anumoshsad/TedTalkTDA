VYou all know this story.
p4
aVIn the summer of 1950,
p5
aVEnrico Fermi, the Italian-American physicist
p6
aVand atomic-pile builder,
p7
aVwent to lunch at Los Alamos National Laboratory
p8
aVand joined some colleagues there, and asked them a question:
p9
aV"Where is everybody?"
p10
aVThis confused his colleagues, obviously,
p11
aVbecause they were sitting right there with him.
p12
aVAnd then he had to clarify that he wasn't talking about them.
p13
aVHe was talking about the space aliens.
p14
aa(lp15
VYou see, this was only a few years after
p16
aVthe supposed flying saucer crash
p17
aVat Roswell, New Mexico.
p18
aVAnd even though that turned out to be nothing,
p19
aVnothing at all \u2014
p20
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p21
aVmerely a downed weather balloon
p22
aVpiloted by small hairless men
p23
aVwith slits for mouths ...
p24
aVStill, America had gone saucer-mad,
p25
aVeven famous scientists
p26
aVwho were eating lunch.
p27
aVFermi's reasoning, if I may paraphrase badly,
p28
aVis that the universe is so vast
p29
aVthat it stands to reason,
p30
aVthere should be other intelligent life out there.
p31
aVAnd the universe is so old
p32
aVthat unless we were the very first civilization ever to evolve,
p33
aVwe should have some evidence of their existence by now.
p34
aVAnd yet, to the best of our knowledge, we are alone.
p35
aa(lp36
V"Where is everybody?" asked Fermi,
p37
aVand his colleagues had no answer.
p38
aVFermi then went on with the same blunt logic
p39
aVto disprove fairies,
p40
aVSasquatch, God,
p41
aVthe possibility of love \u2014
p42
aVand thereafter, as you know,
p43
aVEnrico Fermi ate alone.
p44
aV(Laughter)
p45
aVNow,
p46
aVI am not a scientist.
p47
aVI have never built an atomic pile.
p48
aVAlthough, I might argue that, technically,
p49
aVevery pile is atomic.
p50
aa(lp51
V(Laughter)
p52
aa(lp53
VHowever, with respect, I might point out two possibilities
p54
aVthat Enrico Fermi perhaps did not consider.
p55
aVOne is that the aliens might be
p56
aVvery far away.
p57
aVPerhaps, I dare say,
p58
aVeven on other planets.
p59
aVThe other possibility \u2014
p60
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p61
aVis, perhaps, Enrico Fermi himself
p62
aVwas an alien.
p63
aa(lp64
V(Laughter)
p65
aa(lp66
VThink about it.
p67
aVIsn't it a little convenient
p68
aVthat in the midst of the World War, out of nowhere,
p69
aVsuddenly an Italian scientist showed up
p70
aVwith an amazing new technology
p71
aVthat would transform everything in the world
p72
aVand darken the history of the human species forever after?
p73
aVAnd isn't it a little strange
p74
aVthat he required no payment for this?
p75
aVThat he asked for only one thing \u2014
p76
aVa gift of two healthy sperm whales?
p77
aVThat's \u2014 that's not true.
p78
aVBut it is strange.
p79
aa(lp80
V(Laughter)
p81
aa(lp82
VAnd if Enrico Fermi were indeed a space alien,
p83
aVwouldn't he be the first to have tried to convince
p84
aVhis fellow scientists
p85
aVthat the space aliens are not already here?
p86
aVFor it is given in certain UFO-ology
p87
aVor UFOlogy circles,
p88
aVthat the aliens are already here and have been for millennia;
p89
aVthat they have walked among us in disguise,
p90
aVobserving us, guiding our evolution
p91
aVfrom ape to man \u2014
p92
aVif you believe in that sort of thing \u2014
p93
aVand, occasionally, kidnapping us in their flying saucers
p94
aVand taking us away to have sex with us in pyramids.
p95
aa(lp96
V(Laughter)
p97
aa(lp98
VIt's a difficult theory to discount,
p99
aVI think you'll agree.
p100
aa(lp101
V(Laughter)
p102
aa(lp103
VFor even in my own life,
p104
aVthere are memories I have
p105
aVthat are difficult to explain \u2014
p106
aVhappenings that are so odd and unaccountably weird,
p107
aVthat it is difficult to imagine
p108
aVthey were not the result
p109
aVof prolonged and frequent contact with aliens throughout my life.
p110
aVFor how else will you explain
p111
aVthe amazing and absolutely true
p112
aVclose encounters that I had
p113
aVand will describe to you now?
p114
aVEncounter one: Ocean City, New Jersey, 1980.
p115
aVThis was the summer when the special edition of
p116
aV"Close Encounters of the Third Kind" was released.
p117
aVAnd I went on vacation with my parents to the Jersey shore.
p118
aVWithin 12 hours, I was horribly sunburned,
p119
aVjust like Richard Dreyfuss in the movie.
p120
aa(lp121
V(Laughter)
p122
aa(lp123
VAnd so I spent the rest of the vacation
p124
aVlargely sitting outside our little rental house at night,
p125
aVthe sidewalk still warm from the sun,
p126
aVwatching the skies for UFOs.
p127
aVWhat did I see? Stars, satellites,
p128
aVblinking airplanes \u2014 typical sky junk.
p129
aVOccasionally, kids would come and
p130
aVjoin me and watch,
p131
aVbut their necks soon got sore, and they would go off to the boardwalk
p132
aVto play video games and mingle with humans.
p133
aVI was pretty good at the video games. I was not very good at the other part,
p134
aVso I stayed alone with the cosmos.
p135
aa(lp136
VAnd that's when it happened.
p137
aVAn elderly couple came walking down the street.
p138
aVI would say they were in their late seventies,
p139
aVand I would say that they were on a date,
p140
aVbecause he was wearing a very neat little suit
p141
aVwith a yellow tie \u2014 a brown suit.
p142
aVAnd she was wearing a cardigan, because it was now fully night
p143
aVand a chill was coming in off the ocean.
p144
aVI remember, for some reason,
p145
aVthat they were exactly the same height.
p146
aVAnd then they stopped, and the man turned to me
p147
aVand said,
p148
aV"What are you looking for,
p149
aVflying saucers?"
p150
aa(lp151
V(Laughter)
p152
aa(lp153
VYou have to admit, that's a pretty boss piece of detective work
p154
aVfor an old man on a date.
p155
aVBut what was stranger still \u2014
p156
aVand even I realized it at the time,
p157
aVas a nine-year-old child \u2014
p158
aVwas that they stopped at all.
p159
aVThat this old man would interrupt his moonlight stroll
p160
aVwith his sweetheart with the precise reason
p161
aVof making fun of a child.
p162
aV"Oh," he said,
p163
aV"little green men."
p164
aVAnd then his girlfriend joined in, too.
p165
aV"There's no such thing as space men," she said.
p166
aV"There's no such thing."
p167
aVAnd then they both laughed. "Ha, ha, ha."
p168
aVI looked around.
p169
aVThe street was entirely empty.
p170
aVI had stopped hearing the sound of the ocean.
p171
aVIt was as though time had stopped.
p172
aVI did not know why they were teasing me.
p173
aVI looked into their strangely angry faces,
p174
aVand I remember wondering,
p175
aVare they wearing rubber masks?
p176
aa(lp177
V(Laughter)
p178
aa(lp179
VAnd what would be behind those rubber masks, if they were?
p180
aVGiant, almond-shaped, unblinking eyes?
p181
aVSlits for mouths?
p182
aVThe old man crooked his finger as though he were firing a gun,
p183
aVand then he made laser sounds.
p184
aV"Kew, kew, kew \u2014
p185
aVwatch out."
p186
aVAnd they turned at once and walked away.
p187
aVThe old man reached out
p188
aVhis knobbly claw
p189
aVfor the woman's hand,
p190
aVand found it, and left me alone.
p191
aVNow, you could describe this as a simple misunderstanding \u2014
p192
aVa strange encounter among humans.
p193
aVMaybe it was swamp gas, but \u2014
p194
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p195
aVI know what I saw.
p196
aa(lp197
VClose encounter two: Brookline, Massachusetts, 1984.
p198
aVI went to see the movie "Dune,"
p199
aVand a girl talked to me. Now, on its face \u2014
p200
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p201
aVthis is impossible on its face, I realize \u2014
p202
aVbut it is absolutely true.
p203
aVIt was opening night, naturally.
p204
aVI went with my friend Tim McGonigal, who sat on my left.
p205
aVOn my right was the girl in question.
p206
aVShe had long, curly black hair, a blue jean jacket.
p207
aVI remember, she had some sort of injury to her ankle,
p208
aVan Ace bandage, and she had crutches.
p209
aVShe was very tall, I would say.
p210
aVI was starting high school at the time. I would say she was a junior,
p211
aVbut I had never seen her before. She didn't go to my school.
p212
aVI didn't know her name, and I never will.
p213
aVShe was sitting with someone who I presume was her mother,
p214
aVand they were talking about the novel, "Dune."
p215
aVThey were both big fans, mother and daughter \u2014
p216
aVvery unusual.
p217
aVThey were talking about how their favorite characters
p218
aVwere the giant sandworms.
p219
aVAnd then it got stranger.
p220
aVThat's when she turned to me and said,
p221
aV"Are you looking forward to seeing the movie?"
p222
aa(lp223
V(Laughter)
p224
aa(lp225
VFirst of all, I was embarrassed
p226
aVbecause I had not read the novel "Dune" at that time.
p227
aVI was merely a connoisseur of movies
p228
aVfeaturing desert planets, as I still am.
p229
aa(lp230
V(Laughter)
p231
aVBut it was also the tone of how she asked the question:
p232
aVapropos of nothing, like she didn't even care about the answer,
p233
aVas though she just wanted to talk to me.
p234
aVI did not know what to say. I said, "Yes."
p235
aVI did not even turn my head.
p236
aVThe movie began.
p237
aVI need not remind you that this was David Lynch's version of "Dune,"
p238
aVin which all of the characters
p239
aVwere sexy and deformed at the same time.
p240
aa(lp241
V(Laughter)
p242
aa(lp243
VThere was a character called the Third-Stage Guild Navigator,
p244
aVwhich was a kind of giant, floating fetus-creature
p245
aVthat lived in a giant tank with this orange mist
p246
aVof psychedelic spice
p247
aVswirling around him,
p248
aVallowing him to bend space and time.
p249
aVHe could never leave the tank
p250
aVor interact with the outside world.
p251
aVHe had become, in his isolation,
p252
aVso deformed and so sexy,
p253
aVthat he had to talk through a kind of old-timey radio
p254
aVto the outside world, and could never touch them.
p255
aVI mean, I liked him a lot better than the sandworms.
p256
aVThe sandworms were fine, but your favorite character?
p257
aVPlease.
p258
aa(lp259
VWhen the movie ended,
p260
aVeveryone seemed very happy
p261
aVto get up and get out of the theatre as soon as possible.
p262
aVExcept for the girl.
p263
aVAs I walked out, her pace slowed.
p264
aVPerhaps it was the crutches,
p265
aVbut it seemed \u2014
p266
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p267
aVit seemed as though she might want to talk to me again.
p268
aVWhen I say it out loud, it sounds so ridiculous,
p269
aVbut I can only come to the conclusion
p270
aVthat it was what, in the alien abductee community,
p271
aVthey call a "screen memory":
p272
aVa ridiculous false recollection designed by their brain
p273
aVto cover up some trauma \u2014 say, of being kidnapped
p274
aVand flown off to a sex pyramid.
p275
aa(lp276
V(Laughter)
p277
aa(lp278
VAnd so I sure am glad
p279
aVI did not slow down to talk to her.
p280
aVI sure am glad I never saw her again.
p281
aa(lp282
VClose encounter three: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
p283
aV1989.
p284
aVIn the mid-to-late '80s,
p285
aVthe novelist Whitley Strieber wrote a book called "Communion,"
p286
aVin which he described his own lifelong experiences
p287
aVbeing abducted by aliens.
p288
aVAnd he also described the phenomenon known in this community
p289
aVas "lost time,"
p290
aVwhere Whitley Strieber would suddenly become aware
p291
aVthat he could not remember the previous ten minutes,
p292
aVor the previous ten hours, or the previous ten days.
p293
aVAnd would come to the conclusion that that was when the aliens
p294
aVwere taking him and giving him rectal probes.
p295
aa(lp296
V(Laughter)
p297
aa(lp298
VThis book became, naturally, an enormous best-seller.
p299
aVThis image by Ted Joseph was from that book,
p300
aVand was his, sort of, police sketch
p301
aVof what the creatures looked like
p302
aVthat Whitley Strieber had described to him.
p303
aVAnd it was so successful that they made it into a movie.
p304
aVAnd in 1989, the way I remember it,
p305
aVI was in Philadelphia
p306
aVvisiting my girlfriend, and we decided,
p307
aVapropos of nothing, to go see this movie.
p308
aVAnd the way I remember it, the movie featured these details.
p309
aVOne: Whitley Strieber
p310
aVwas played by Christopher Walken.
p311
aVTwo: the alien was played by a rubber puppet.
p312
aa(lp313
V(Laughter)
p314
aa(lp315
VThree: there was a surprisingly long
p316
aVsequence of the film in which the rubber puppet
p317
aVgives Christopher Walken a rectal probe.
p318
aVFour: this was being shown
p319
aVin a regular movie theater in Center City, Philadelphia.
p320
aVFive: all of which is to say,
p321
aVthey made a movie out of the book, "Communion,"
p322
aVand it starred Christopher Walken.
p323
aVDoes something seem strange about this to you?
p324
aVSomething odd? Something off? Something wrong with this picture?
p325
aVThink about it. Yes. The answer is:
p326
aVI had a girlfriend. What?
p327
aa(lp328
V(Laughter)
p329
aa(lp330
VHow did this happen? When did this happen?
p331
aVI remember walking out of the theater
p332
aVand becoming suddenly aware of this fact,
p333
aVas we walked hand in hand,
p334
aVand pondering these very same questions.
p335
aVAnd to this day, I have no answer for you.
p336
aVClose encounter four: the Algarve,
p337
aVPortugal, 1991.
p338
aVSome years later, I and this woman \u2014
p339
aVwe'll call her "Catherine Fletcher" \u2014
p340
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p341
aVwent traveling through the south of Portugal together.
p342
aVWe stayed in old, crumbling, walled cities,
p343
aVin tiny little hotels,
p344
aVand we would climb up to the roof and drink Vinho Verde
p345
aVand watch the sun set and play checkers.
p346
aVWhat? Did we do this? Really? Does anyone do this?
p347
aVWe went to some topless beaches.
p348
aVExcuse me? No, not in my life.
p349
aVFor what it's worth, we went to Sagres,
p350
aVwhich was considered, at the time, to be the end of the world.
p351
aVAnd there I was chased by a pack of feral dogs on the dock,
p352
aVand the lead dog bit me on the ass,
p353
aVrequiring me to go to a strange Portuguese clinic
p354
aVand receive an ass shot.
p355
aVMake of that what you will.
p356
aa(lp357
V(Laughter)
p358
aa(lp359
VOur last day in Portugal,
p360
aVwe were in the district capital of Faro,
p361
aVand Catherine decided that she wanted to go to the beach
p362
aVone last time.
p363
aVNow, Faro is a bustling little city,
p364
aVand to get to the beach, she explained, you would have to take
p365
aVa bus and then a boat.
p366
aVAnd did I want to come with?
p367
aVBut I was exhausted and dog-bitten, and so I said, "No."
p368
aVI remember what she looked like before she left.
p369
aVThe freckles had grown
p370
aVand multiplied on her face and shoulders,
p371
aVclustering into a kind of a tan.
p372
aVA tan, we were both tan \u2014
p373
aVis this true?
p374
aVHer eyes were extra bright and extra blue, as a result.
p375
aVShe was smiling.
p376
aVShe was a single woman about to go alone into a country,
p377
aVnot even speaking the language,
p378
aVto travel alone by bus and boat
p379
aVto go to a beach she did not know
p380
aVor had never seen.
p381
aVI loved her, and then she went out
p382
aVinto that strange, alien land.
p383
aa(lp384
VIt took me some time to come to my senses.
p385
aVI had my own "lost time" moment,
p386
aVwhere I woke up and suddenly realized
p387
aVit was very late in the day, almost dinnertime,
p388
aVand she had not come back.
p389
aVNervous, I went down to the street to look for her.
p390
aVNow, I did not speak Portuguese.
p391
aVI did not know where the beach was.
p392
aVI could not call her on a cell phone because this was 1991,
p393
aVand the aliens had not given us that technology yet.
p394
aa(lp395
V(Laughter)
p396
aa(lp397
VI realized that the day would only have
p398
aVtwo possible outcomes:
p399
aVeither Catherine would come back to the hotel,
p400
aVor she would never come back to the hotel.
p401
aVAnd so I sat down to wait.
p402
aVI did not watch the skies, but the very end of the street
p403
aVwhere the buses and cars and pedestrians
p404
aVand little scooters were moving along.
p405
aVAnd I watched those constellations shift,
p406
aVhoping that they would part and I would see her face.
p407
aVIt was at that moment,
p408
aVin that very small town of 30,000 or so,
p409
aVthat I truly appreciated the vastness of the universe
p410
aVand the searching we might do in it.
p411
aVAnd that's when the Liberians came along.
p412
aVFive young men \u2014 all laughing, happy, traveling together,
p413
aVcoming back to this hotel where they were staying.
p414
aa(lp415
VOne of them was named Joseph, and he asked me
p416
aVwhat was I doing, and I explained.
p417
aVAnd he said, "Don't worry." He was sure that Catherine would be safe.
p418
aVBut he did not seem so very sure,
p419
aVfor he sat down to wait with me.
p420
aVAnd for the next two hours, they all waited with me:
p421
aVtaking turns, going up to their room, coming back,
p422
aVtelling me jokes, distracting me.
p423
aVTwo hours, they gave me a message.
p424
aVWe are not alone.
p425
aa(lp426
VAnd then, in the middle of a sentence, at the very birth of twilight,
p427
aVI turned and looked down the street.
p428
aVThe stars aligned, and she came back.
p429
aVShe was smiling. She did not understand why I was so worried.
p430
aVNeither did the Liberians,
p431
aValthough there was a huge amount of relief in their laughter
p432
aVas they clapped us on the back, and went back up to their room
p433
aVand left us alone in the street, holding hands.
p434
aVAn event like this leaves a scar on the memory,
p435
aVmuch like a piece of alien technology
p436
aVthat has been inserted into your buttocks
p437
aVby a "Portuguese doctor."
p438
aa(lp439
V(Laughter)
p440
aa(lp441
VAnd even now, a decade and a half later,
p442
aVeven now that we are married,
p443
aVI look for her still, whenever she is not in the room.
p444
aVAnd even though, I think you'll agree, it is probable
p445
aVthat during the time she was away,
p446
aVshe was kidnapped and replaced by an alien clone,
p447
aVI love her and wait for her still.
p448
aa(lp449
VThank you for your kind attention.
