VSo, I have an overlooked but potentially lucrative
p4
aVinvestment opportunity for you.
p5
aVOver the past 10 years in the UK,
p6
aVthe return on burial plots has outperformed the UK property market
p7
aVby a ratio of around three to one.
p8
aVThere are private cemeteries being set up with plots for sale to investors,
p9
aVand they start at around 3,900 pounds.
p10
aVAnd they're projected to achieve about 40 percent growth.
p11
aVThe biggest advantage is that this is a market with continuous demand.
p12
aa(lp13
VNow, this is a real proposition,
p14
aVand there are companies out there that really are offering this investment,
p15
aVbut my interest in it is quite different.
p16
aVI'm an architect and urban designer,
p17
aVand for the past year and a half,
p18
aVI've been looking at approaches to death and dying
p19
aVand at how they've shaped our cities and the buildings within them.
p20
aa(lp21
VSo in the summer, I did my first exhibition
p22
aVon death and architecture in Venice,
p23
aVand it was called "Death in Venice."
p24
aVAnd because death is a subject
p25
aVthat many of us find quite uncomfortable to talk about,
p26
aVthe exhibition was designed to be quite playful,
p27
aVso that people would literally engage with it.
p28
aVSo one of our exhibits was an interactive map of London
p29
aVwhich showed just how much of the real estate in the city
p30
aVis given over to death.
p31
aVAs you wave your hand across the map,
p32
aVthe name of the piece of real estate \u2014 the building or the cemetery \u2014
p33
aVis revealed.
p34
aVAnd those white shapes that you can see,
p35
aVthey're all of the hospitals and hospices
p36
aVand mortuaries and cemeteries in the city.
p37
aVIn fact, the majority are cemeteries.
p38
aVWe wanted to show that, even though death and burial are things
p39
aVthat we might not think about,
p40
aVthey're all around us, and they're important parts of our cities.
p41
aa(lp42
VSo about half a million people die in the UK each year,
p43
aVand of those, around a quarter will want to be buried.
p44
aVBut the UK, like many Western European countries,
p45
aVis running out of burial space,
p46
aVespecially in the major cities.
p47
aVAnd the Greater London Authority has been aware of this for a while,
p48
aVand the main causes are population growth,
p49
aVthe fact that existing cemeteries are almost full.
p50
aVThere's a custom in the UK that graves are considered to be occupied forever,
p51
aVand there's also development pressure \u2014 people want to use that same land
p52
aVto build houses or offices or shops.
p53
aa(lp54
VSo they came up with a few solutions.
p55
aVThey were like, well, maybe we can reuse those graves after 50 years.
p56
aVOr maybe we can bury people, like, four deep,
p57
aVso that four people can be buried in the same plot,
p58
aVand we can make more efficient use of the land that way,
p59
aVand in that way, hopefully London will still have space to bury people
p60
aVin the near future.
p61
aa(lp62
VBut, traditionally, cemeteries haven't been taken care of
p63
aVby the local authority.
p64
aVIn fact, the surprising thing is that there's no legal obligation
p65
aVon anyone in the UK to provide burial space.
p66
aVTraditionally, it's been done by private and religious organizations,
p67
aVlike churches and mosques and synagogues.
p68
aVBut there's also occasionally been a for-profit group
p69
aVwho has wanted to get in on the act.
p70
aVAnd, you know, they look at the small size of a burial plot
p71
aVand that high cost,
p72
aVand it looks like there's serious money to be made.
p73
aa(lp74
VSo, actually, if you want to go out and start your own cemetery,
p75
aVyou kind of can.
p76
aVThere was this couple in South Wales,
p77
aVand they had a farmhouse and a load of fields next to it,
p78
aVand they wanted to develop the land.
p79
aVThey had a load of ideas.
p80
aVThey first thought about making a caravan park,
p81
aVbut the council said no.
p82
aVAnd then they wanted to make a fish farm
p83
aVand again the council said no.
p84
aVThen they hit on the idea of making a cemetery
p85
aVand they calculated that by doing this,
p86
aVthey could increase the value of their land
p87
aVfrom about 95,000 pounds to over one million pounds.
p88
aa(lp89
VBut just to come back to this idea of making profit from cemeteries,
p90
aVlike, it's kind of ludicrous, right?
p91
aVThe thing is that the high cost of those burial plots
p92
aVis actually very misleading.
p93
aVThey look like they're expensive,
p94
aVbut that cost reflects the fact that you need to maintain the burial plot \u2014
p95
aVlike, someone has to cut the grass for the next 50 years.
p96
aVThat means it's very difficult to make money from cemeteries.
p97
aVAnd it's the reason that normally they're run by the council
p98
aVor by a not-for-profit group.
p99
aVBut anyway, the council granted these people permission,
p100
aVand they're now trying to build their cemetery.
p101
aa(lp102
VSo just to explain to you kind of how this works:
p103
aVIf I want to build something in the UK,
p104
aVlike a cemetery for example,
p105
aVthen I have to apply for planning permission first.
p106
aVSo if I want to build a new office building for a client
p107
aVor if I want to extend my home
p108
aVor, you know, if I have a shop and I want to convert it into an office,
p109
aVI have to do a load of drawings,
p110
aVand I submit them to the council for permission.
p111
aVAnd they'll look at things like how it fits in the surroundings.
p112
aVSo they'll look at what it looks like.
p113
aVBut they'll also think about things like what impact is it going to have
p114
aVon the local environment?
p115
aVAnd they'll be thinking about things like,
p116
aVis this thing going to cause pollution
p117
aVor is there going to be a lot of traffic
p118
aVthat wants to go to this thing that I've built?
p119
aVBut also good things.
p120
aVIs it going to add local services like shops to the neighborhood
p121
aVthat local people would like to use?
p122
aVAnd they'll weigh up the advantages and the disadvantages
p123
aVand they'll make a decision.
p124
aa(lp125
VSo that's how it works if I want to build a large cemetery.
p126
aVBut what if I've got a piece of land
p127
aVand I just want to bury a few people, like five or six?
p128
aVWell, then \u2014 actually, I don't need permission from anyone!
p129
aVThere's actually almost no regulation in the UK around burial,
p130
aVand the little bit that there is, is about not polluting water courses,
p131
aVlike not polluting rivers or groundwater.
p132
aVSo actually, if you want to go and make your own mini-cemetery,
p133
aVthen you can.
p134
aa(lp135
VBut I mean, like \u2014 really, who does this? Right?
p136
aVWell, if you're an aristocratic family and you have a large estate,
p137
aVthen there's a chance that you'll have a mausoleum on it,
p138
aVand you'll bury your family there.
p139
aVBut the really weird thing
p140
aVis that you don't need to have a piece of land of a certain size
p141
aVbefore you're allowed to start burying people on it.
p142
aVAnd so that means that, technically,
p143
aVthis applies to, like, the back garden of your house in the suburbs.
p144
aa(lp145
V(Laughter)
p146
aa(lp147
VSo what if you wanted to try this yourself at home?
p148
aVWell, there's a few councils that have guidance on their website
p149
aVwhich can help you.
p150
aa(lp151
VSo, the first thing that they tell you
p152
aVis that you need to have a certificate of burial before you can go ahead \u2014
p153
aVyou're not allowed to just murder people and put them under the patio.
p154
aa(lp155
V(Laughter)
p156
aa(lp157
VThey also tell you that you need to keep a record of where the grave is.
p158
aVBut that's pretty much it for formal requirements.
p159
aVNow, they do warn you that your neighbors might not like this,
p160
aVbut, legally speaking, there's almost nothing that they can do about it.
p161
aVAnd just in case any of you still had that profit idea in your mind
p162
aVabout how much those burial plots cost
p163
aVand how much money you might be able to make,
p164
aVthey also warn that it might cause the value of your house
p165
aVto drop by 20 percent.
p166
aVAlthough, actually, it's more likely
p167
aVthat no one will want to buy your house at all after that.
p168
aa(lp169
VSo what I find fascinating about this
p170
aVis the fact that it kind of sums up many of our attitudes towards death.
p171
aVIn the UK, and I think that the figures across Europe are probably similar,
p172
aVonly about 30 percent of people have ever talked to anyone
p173
aVabout their wishes around death,
p174
aVand even for people over 75,
p175
aVonly 45 percent of people have ever talked about this.
p176
aVAnd the reasons that people give ... you know,
p177
aVthey think that their death is far off
p178
aVor they think that they're going to make people uncomfortable
p179
aVby talking about it.
p180
aVAnd you know, to a certain extent,
p181
aVthere are other people out there who are taking care of things for us.
p182
aVThe government has all this regulation and bureaucracy around things
p183
aVlike burying a death, for example,
p184
aVand there's people like funeral directors
p185
aVwho devote their entire working lives to this issue.
p186
aVBut when it comes to our cities
p187
aVand thinking about how death fits in our cities,
p188
aVthere's much less regulation and design and thought
p189
aVthan we might imagine.
p190
aa(lp191
VSo we're not thinking about this,
p192
aVbut all of the people we imagine are thinking about it \u2014
p193
aVthey're not taking care of it either.
p194
aa(lp195
VThank you.
