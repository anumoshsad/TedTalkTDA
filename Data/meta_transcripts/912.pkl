VI still remember the day in school
p4
aVwhen our teacher told us
p5
aVthat the world population had become
p6
aVthree billion people,
p7
aVand that was in 1960.
p8
aVI'm going to talk now about
p9
aVhow world population has changed from that year
p10
aVand into the future,
p11
aVbut I will not use digital technology,
p12
aVas I've done during my first five TEDTalks.
p13
aVInstead, I have progressed,
p14
aVand I am, today, launching
p15
aVa brand new analog teaching technology
p16
aVthat I picked up from IKEA:
p17
aVthis box.
p18
aa(lp19
VThis box contains one billion people.
p20
aVAnd our teacher told us
p21
aVthat the industrialized world, 1960,
p22
aVhad one billion people.
p23
aVIn the developing world, she said,
p24
aVthey had two billion people.
p25
aVAnd they lived away then.
p26
aVThere was a big gap between
p27
aVthe one billion in the industrialized world
p28
aVand the two billion in the developing world.
p29
aVIn the industrialized world,
p30
aVpeople were healthy,
p31
aVeducated, rich,
p32
aVand they had small families.
p33
aVAnd their aspiration
p34
aVwas to buy a car.
p35
aVAnd in 1960, all Swedes were saving
p36
aVto try to buy a Volvo like this.
p37
aVThis was the economic level at which Sweden was.
p38
aVBut in contrast to this,
p39
aVin the developing world, far away,
p40
aVthe aspiration of the average family there
p41
aVwas to have food for the day.
p42
aVThey were saving
p43
aVto be able to buy a pair of shoes.
p44
aVThere was an enormous gap in the world
p45
aVwhen I grew up.
p46
aVAnd this gap between the West and the rest
p47
aVhas created a mindset of the world,
p48
aVwhich we still use linguistically
p49
aVwhen we talk about "the West"
p50
aVand "the Developing World."
p51
aVBut the world has changed,
p52
aVand it's overdue to upgrade that mindset
p53
aVand that taxonomy of the world, and to understand it.
p54
aa(lp55
VAnd that's what I'm going to show you,
p56
aVbecause since 1960
p57
aVwhat has happened in the world up to 2010
p58
aVis that a staggering
p59
aVfour billion people
p60
aVhave been added to the world population.
p61
aVJust look how many.
p62
aVThe world population has doubled
p63
aVsince I went to school.
p64
aVAnd of course, there's been economic growth in the West.
p65
aVA lot of companies have happened to grow the economy,
p66
aVso the Western population moved over to here.
p67
aVAnd now their aspiration is not only to have a car.
p68
aVNow they want to have a holiday on a very remote destination
p69
aVand they want to fly.
p70
aVSo this is where they are today.
p71
aVAnd the most successful of the developing countries,
p72
aVthey have moved on, you know,
p73
aVand they have become emerging economies, we call them.
p74
aVThey are now buying cars.
p75
aVAnd what happened a month ago
p76
aVwas that the Chinese company, Geely,
p77
aVthey acquired the Volvo company,
p78
aVand then finally the Swedes understood that
p79
aVsomething big had happened in the world.
p80
aV(Laughter)
p81
aa(lp82
VSo there they are.
p83
aVAnd the tragedy is that the two billion over here
p84
aVthat is struggling for food and shoes,
p85
aVthey are still almost as poor
p86
aVas they were 50 years ago.
p87
aVThe new thing is that
p88
aVwe have the biggest pile of billions, the three billions here,
p89
aVwhich are also becoming emerging economies,
p90
aVbecause they are quite healthy, relatively well-educated,
p91
aVand they already also have two to three children
p92
aVper woman, as those [richer also] have.
p93
aVAnd their aspiration now
p94
aVis, of course, to buy a bicycle,
p95
aVand then later on they would like to have a motorbike also.
p96
aVBut this is the world
p97
aVwe have today,
p98
aVno longer any gap.
p99
aVBut the distance from the poorest here, the very poorest,
p100
aVto the very richest over here is wider than ever.
p101
aVBut there is a continuous world
p102
aVfrom walking, biking,
p103
aVdriving, flying \u2014
p104
aVthere are people on all levels,
p105
aVand most people tend to be somewhere in the middle.
p106
aVThis is the new world we have today
p107
aVin 2010.
p108
aa(lp109
VAnd what will happen in the future?
p110
aVWell, I'm going to project
p111
aVinto 2050.
p112
aVI was in Shanghai recently,
p113
aVand I listened to what's happening in China,
p114
aVand it's pretty sure that they will catch up,
p115
aVjust as Japan did.
p116
aVAll the projections [say that] this one [billion] will [only] grow with
p117
aVone to two or three percent.
p118
aV[But this second] grows with seven, eight percent, and then they will end up here.
p119
aVThey will start flying.
p120
aVAnd these
p121
aVlower or middle income countries, the emerging income countries,
p122
aVthey will also forge forwards economically.
p123
aVAnd if,
p124
aVbut only if,
p125
aVwe invest in the right green technology \u2014
p126
aVso that we can avoid severe climate change,
p127
aVand energy can still be relatively cheap \u2014
p128
aVthen they will move all the way up here.
p129
aVAnd they will start to buy
p130
aVelectric cars.
p131
aVThis is what we will find there.
p132
aa(lp133
VSo what about the poorest two billion?
p134
aVWhat about the poorest two billion here?
p135
aVWill they move on?
p136
aVWell, here population [growth] comes in
p137
aVbecause there [among emerging economies] we already have two to three children per woman,
p138
aVfamily planning is widely used,
p139
aVand population growth is coming to an end.
p140
aVHere [among the poorest], population is growing.
p141
aVSo these [poorest] two billion will, in the next decades,
p142
aVincrease to three billion,
p143
aVand they will thereafter
p144
aVincrease to four billion.
p145
aVThere is nothing \u2014
p146
aVbut a nuclear war of a kind we've never seen \u2014
p147
aVthat can stop this [growth] from happening.
p148
aVBecause we already have this [growth] in process.
p149
aVBut if, and only if,
p150
aV[the poorest] get out of poverty,
p151
aVthey get education, they get improved child survival,
p152
aVthey can buy a bicycle and a cell phone and come [to live] here,
p153
aVthen population growth
p154
aVwill stop in 2050.
p155
aVWe cannot have people on this level
p156
aVlooking for food and shoes
p157
aVbecause then we get continued population growth.
p158
aa(lp159
VAnd let me show you why
p160
aVby converting back to the old-time
p161
aVdigital technology.
p162
aVHere I have on the screen
p163
aVmy country bubbles.
p164
aVEvery bubble is a country. The size is population.
p165
aVThe colors show the continent.
p166
aVThe yellow on there is the Americas;
p167
aVdark blue is Africa; brown is Europe;
p168
aVgreen is the Middle East
p169
aVand this light blue is South Asia.
p170
aVThat's India and this is China. Size is population.
p171
aVHere I have children per woman:
p172
aVtwo children, four children, six children, eight children \u2014
p173
aVbig families, small families.
p174
aVThe year is 1960.
p175
aVAnd down here, child survival,
p176
aVthe percentage of children surviving childhood
p177
aVup to starting school:
p178
aV60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent, 90,
p179
aVand almost 100 percent, as we have today
p180
aVin the wealthiest and healthiest countries.
p181
aVBut look, this is the world my teacher talked about in 1960:
p182
aVone billion Western world here \u2014
p183
aVhigh child-survival, small families \u2014
p184
aVand all the rest,
p185
aVthe rainbow of developing countries,
p186
aVwith very large families
p187
aVand poor child survival.
p188
aa(lp189
VWhat has happened? I start the world. Here we go.
p190
aVCan you see, as the years pass by, child survival is increasing?
p191
aVThey get soap, hygiene, education,
p192
aVvaccination, penicillin
p193
aVand then family planning. Family size is decreasing.
p194
aV[When] they get up to 90-percent child survival, then families decrease,
p195
aVand most of the Arab countries in the Middle East
p196
aVis falling down there [to small families].
p197
aVLook, Bangladesh catching up with India.
p198
aVThe whole emerging world
p199
aVjoins the Western world
p200
aVwith good child survival
p201
aVand small family size,
p202
aVbut we still have the poorest billion.
p203
aVCan you see the poorest billion,
p204
aVthose [two] boxes I had over here?
p205
aVThey are still up here.
p206
aVAnd they still have a child survival
p207
aVof only 70 to 80 percent,
p208
aVmeaning that if you have six children born,
p209
aVthere will be at least four who survive
p210
aVto the next generation.
p211
aVAnd the population will double in one generation.
p212
aa(lp213
VSo the only way
p214
aVof really getting world population [growth] to stop
p215
aVis to continue to improve child survival
p216
aVto 90 percent.
p217
aVThat's why investments by Gates Foundation,
p218
aVUNICEF and aid organizations,
p219
aVtogether with national government in the poorest countries,
p220
aVare so good;
p221
aVbecause they are actually
p222
aVhelping us to reach
p223
aVa sustainable population size of the world.
p224
aVWe can stop at nine billion if we do the right things.
p225
aVChild survival is the new green.
p226
aVIt's only by child survival
p227
aVthat we will stop population growth.
p228
aVAnd will it happen?
p229
aVWell, I'm not an optimist,
p230
aVneither am I a pessimist.
p231
aVI'm a very serious "possibilist."
p232
aVIt's a new category where we take emotion apart,
p233
aVand we just work analytically with the world.
p234
aVIt can be done.
p235
aVWe can have a much more just world.
p236
aVWith green technology
p237
aVand with investments to alleviate poverty,
p238
aVand global governance,
p239
aVthe world can become like this.
p240
aa(lp241
VAnd look at the position of the old West.
p242
aVRemember when this blue box was all alone,
p243
aVleading the world, living its own life.
p244
aVThis will not happen [again].
p245
aVThe role of the old West in the new world
p246
aVis to become the foundation
p247
aVof the modern world \u2014
p248
aVnothing more, nothing less.
p249
aVBut it's a very important role.
p250
aVDo it well and get used to it.
p251
