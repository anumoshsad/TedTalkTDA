VToday, I am going to talk about anger.
p4
aVWhen I was 11,
p5
aVseeing some of my friends  leaving the school
p6
aVbecause their parents  could not afford textbooks
p7
aVmade me angry.
p8
aVWhen I was 27,
p9
aVhearing the plight of a desperate slave father
p10
aVwhose daughter was  about to be sold to a brothel
p11
aVmade me angry.
p12
aVAt the age of 50,
p13
aVlying on the street, in a pool of blood,
p14
aValong with my own son,
p15
aVmade me angry.
p16
aa(lp17
VDear friends, for centuries we were taught anger is bad.
p18
aVOur parents, teachers, priests \u2014
p19
aVeveryone taught us how to control  and suppress our anger.
p20
aVBut I ask why?
p21
aVWhy can't we convert our anger for the larger good of society?
p22
aVWhy can't we use our anger
p23
aVto challenge and change the evils of the world?
p24
aVThat I tried to do.
p25
aa(lp26
VFriends,
p27
aVmost of the brightest ideas came to my mind out of anger.
p28
aVLike when I was 35 and sat  in a locked-up, tiny prison.
p29
aVThe whole night, I was angry.
p30
aVBut it has given birth to a new idea.
p31
aVBut I will come to that later on.
p32
aVLet me begin with the story of how I got a name for myself.
p33
aa(lp34
VI had been a big admirer  of Mahatma Gandhi since my childhood.
p35
aVGandhi fought and lead  India's freedom movement.
p36
aVBut more importantly,
p37
aVhe taught us how to treat  the most vulnerable sections,
p38
aVthe most deprived people,  with dignity and respect.
p39
aVAnd so, when India was celebrating
p40
aVMahatma Gandhi's  birth centenary in 1969 \u2014
p41
aVat that time I was 15 \u2014
p42
aVan idea came to my mind.
p43
aVWhy can't we celebrate it differently?
p44
aVI knew, as perhaps many of you might know,
p45
aVthat in India, a large number of people are born in the lowest segment of caste.
p46
aVAnd they are treated as untouchables.
p47
aVThese are the people \u2014
p48
aVforget about allowing them  to go to the temples,
p49
aVthey cannot even go into the houses  and shops of high-caste people.
p50
aa(lp51
VSo I was very impressed with  the leaders of my town
p52
aVwho were speaking very highly against the caste system and untouchability
p53
aVand talking of Gandhian ideals.
p54
aVSo inspired by that, I thought, let us set an example
p55
aVby inviting these people to eat food cooked and served
p56
aVby the untouchable community.
p57
aVI went to some low-caste, so-called untouchable, people,
p58
aVtried to convince them, but it was unthinkable for them.
p59
aVThey told me, "No, no. It's not possible. It never happened."
p60
aVI said, "Look at these leaders,
p61
aVthey are so great,  they are against untouchability.
p62
aVThey will come. If nobody comes,  we can set an example."
p63
aVThese people thought that I was too naive.
p64
aVFinally, they were convinced.
p65
aa(lp66
VMy friends and I took our bicycles and invited political leaders.
p67
aVAnd I was so thrilled, rather, empowered
p68
aVto see that each one of them  agreed to come.
p69
aVI thought, "Great idea. We can set an example.
p70
aVWe can bring about change in the society."
p71
aa(lp72
VThe day has come.
p73
aVAll these untouchables, three women and two men,
p74
aVthey agreed to come.
p75
aVI could recall that they had used  the best of their clothes.
p76
aVThey brought new utensils.
p77
aVThey had taken baths  hundreds of times
p78
aVbecause it was unthinkable for them to do.
p79
aVIt was the moment of change.
p80
aVThey gathered. Food was cooked.
p81
aVIt was 7 o'clock.
p82
aVBy 8 o'clock, we kept on waiting,
p83
aVbecause it's not very uncommon  that the leaders become late,
p84
aVfor an hour or so.
p85
aa(lp86
VSo after 8 o'clock, we took our bicycles and went to these leaders' homes,
p87
aVjust to remind them.
p88
aVOne of the leader's wives told me,
p89
aV"Sorry, he is having some headache, perhaps he cannot come."
p90
aVI went to another leader
p91
aVand his wife told me,  "Okay, you go, he will definitely join."
p92
aVSo I thought that the dinner will take place,
p93
aVthough not at that large a scale.
p94
aa(lp95
VI went back to the venue, which was a newly built Mahatma Gandhi Park.
p96
aVIt was 10 o'clock.
p97
aVNone of the leaders showed up.
p98
aVThat made me angry.
p99
aVI was standing, leaning against Mahatma Gandhi's statue.
p100
aVI was emotionally drained, rather exhausted.
p101
aVThen I sat down where  the food was lying.
p102
aVI kept my emotions on hold.
p103
aVBut then, when I took the first bite,
p104
aVI broke down in tears.
p105
aVAnd suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder.
p106
aVAnd it was the healing, motherly touch  of an untouchable woman.
p107
aVAnd she told me, "Kailash, why are you crying?
p108
aVYou have done your bit.
p109
aVYou have eaten the food cooked by untouchables,
p110
aVwhich has never happened in our memory."
p111
aVShe said, "You won today."
p112
aVAnd my friends, she was right.
p113
aa(lp114
VI came back home, a little after midnight,
p115
aVshocked to see that several  high-caste elderly people
p116
aVwere sitting in my courtyard.
p117
aVI saw my mother and  elderly women were crying
p118
aVand they were pleading  to these elderly people
p119
aVbecause they had threatened  to outcaste my whole family.
p120
aVAnd you know, outcasting the family is the biggest social punishment
p121
aVone can think of.
p122
aVSomehow they agreed to punish only me, and the punishment was purification.
p123
aVThat means I had to go 600 miles away from my hometown
p124
aVto the River Ganges to take a holy dip.
p125
aVAnd after that, I should organize a feast for priests, 101 priests,
p126
aVwash their feet and drink that water.
p127
aa(lp128
VIt was total nonsense,
p129
aVand I refused to accept that punishment.
p130
aVHow did they punish me?
p131
aVI was barred from entering into my own  kitchen and my own dining room,
p132
aVmy utensils were separated.
p133
aVBut the night when I was angry, they wanted to outcaste me.
p134
aVBut I decided to outcaste  the entire caste system.
p135
aV(Applause)
p136
aa(lp137
VAnd that was possible because the beginning would have been
p138
aVto change the family name, or surname,
p139
aVbecause in India, most of the family names are caste names.
p140
aVSo I decided to drop my name.
p141
aVAnd then, later on, I gave  a new name to myself: Satyarthi,
p142
aVthat means, "seeker of truth."
p143
aV(Applause)
p144
aVAnd that was the beginning  of my transformative anger.
p145
aa(lp146
VFriends, maybe one of you can tell me,
p147
aVwhat was I doing before becoming a children's rights activist?
p148
aVDoes anybody know?
p149
aVNo.
p150
aVI was an engineer, an electrical engineer.
p151
aVAnd then I learned how the energy
p152
aVof burning fire, coal,
p153
aVthe nuclear blast inside the chambers,
p154
aVraging river currents,
p155
aVfierce winds,
p156
aVcould be converted into the light  and lives of millions.
p157
aVI also learned how the most uncontrollable form of energy
p158
aVcould be harnessed for good  and making society better.
p159
aa(lp160
VSo I'll come back to the story of when I was caught in the prison:
p161
aVI was very happy freeing  a dozen children from slavery,
p162
aVhanding them over to their parents.
p163
aVI cannot explain my joy  when I free a child.
p164
aVI was so happy.
p165
aVBut when I was waiting for my train to come back to my hometown, Delhi,
p166
aVI saw that dozens of children  were arriving;
p167
aVthey were being trafficked by someone.
p168
aVI stopped them, those people.
p169
aVI complained to the police.
p170
aVSo the policemen, instead of helping me,
p171
aVthey threw me in this small,  tiny shell, like an animal.
p172
aVAnd that was the night of anger
p173
aVwhen one of the brightest  and biggest ideas was born.
p174
aVI thought that if I keep on freeing 10  children, and 50 more will join,
p175
aVthat's not done.
p176
aVAnd I believed in the power of consumers,
p177
aVand let me tell you that this was the first time
p178
aVwhen a campaign was launched by me or anywhere in the world,
p179
aVto educate and sensitize the consumers
p180
aVto create a demand for child-labor-free rugs.
p181
aVIn Europe and America,  we have been successful.
p182
aVAnd it has resulted  in a fall in child labor
p183
aVin South Asian countries by 80 percent.
p184
aV(Applause)
p185
aa(lp186
VNot only that, but this first-ever  consumer's power, or consumer's campaign
p187
aVhas grown in other countries and other industries,
p188
aVmaybe chocolate, maybe apparel,  maybe shoes \u2014 it has gone beyond.
p189
aVMy anger at the age of 11,
p190
aVwhen I realized how important education is for every child,
p191
aVI got an idea to collect used books and help the poorest children.
p192
aVI created a book bank at the age of 11.
p193
aVBut I did not stop.
p194
aVLater on, I cofounded
p195
aVthe world's single largest civil society campaign for education
p196
aVthat is the Global Campaign for Education.
p197
aVThat has helped in changing  the whole thinking towards education
p198
aVfrom the charity mode to the human rights mode,
p199
aVand that has concretely helped  the reduction of out-of-school children
p200
aVby half in the last 15 years.
p201
aV(Applause)
p202
aa(lp203
VMy anger at the age of 27,
p204
aVto free that girl who was about to be sold to a brothel,
p205
aVhas given me an idea
p206
aVto go for a new strategy of raid and rescue,
p207
aVfreeing children from slavery.
p208
aVAnd I am so lucky and proud to say that it is not one or 10 or 20,
p209
aVbut my colleagues and I have been able to physically liberate 83,000 child slaves
p210
aVand hand them over back to their families and mothers.
p211
aV(Applause)
p212
aa(lp213
VI knew that we needed global policies.
p214
aVWe organized the worldwide marches against child labor
p215
aVand that has also resulted in  a new international convention
p216
aVto protect the children who are in the worst forms.
p217
aVAnd the concrete result was that the number of child laborers globally
p218
aVhas gone down by one third  in the last 15 years.
p219
aV(Applause)
p220
aa(lp221
VSo, in each case,
p222
aVit began from anger,
p223
aVturned into an idea,
p224
aVand action.
p225
aVSo anger, what next?
p226
aVIdea, and \u2014
p227
aVAudience: Action
p228
aVKailash Satyarthi: Anger, idea, action. Which I tried to do.
p229
aa(lp230
VAnger is a power, anger is an energy,
p231
aVand the law of nature is that energy
p232
aVcan never be created and never  be vanished, can never be destroyed.
p233
aVSo why can't the energy of anger be translated and harnessed
p234
aVto create a better and beautiful world, a more just and equitable world?
p235
aa(lp236
VAnger is within each one of you,
p237
aVand I will share a secret for a few seconds:
p238
aVthat if we are confined in  the narrow shells of egos,
p239
aVand the circles of selfishness,
p240
aVthen the anger will turn out to be hatred, violence, revenge, destruction.
p241
aVBut if we are able to break the circles,
p242
aVthen the same anger could turn  into a great power.
p243
aVWe can break the circles  by using our inherent compassion
p244
aVand connect with the world through  compassion to make this world better.
p245
aVThat same anger could be transformed into it.
p246
aa(lp247
VSo dear friends, sisters and brothers, again, as a Nobel Laureate,
p248
aVI am urging you to become angry.
p249
aVI am urging you to become angry.
p250
aVAnd the angriest among us
p251
aVis the one who can transform his anger  into idea and action.
p252
aa(lp253
VThank you so much.
p254
aa(lp255
V(Applause)
p256
aa(lp257
VChris Anderson: For many years,  you've been an inspiration to others.
p258
aVWho or what inspires you and why?
p259
aa(lp260
VKS: Good question.
p261
aVChris, let me tell you,  and that is the truth,
p262
aVeach time when I free a child,
p263
aVthe child who has lost all his hope that he will ever come back to his mother,
p264
aVthe first smile of freedom,
p265
aVand the mother who has lost all hope
p266
aVthat the son or daughter  can ever come back and sit in her lap,
p267
aVthey become so emotional
p268
aVand the first tear of joy  rolls down on her cheek,
p269
aVI see the glimpse of God in it \u2014 this is my biggest inspiration.
p270
aVAnd I am so lucky that not once, as I said before, but thousands of times,
p271
aVI have been able to witness my God in the faces of those children
p272
aVand they are my biggest inspirations.
p273
aVThank you.
