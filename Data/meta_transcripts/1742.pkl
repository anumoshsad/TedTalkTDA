V"Don't talk to strangers."
p4
aa(lp5
VYou have heard that phrase uttered
p6
aVby your friends, family, schools and the media for decades.
p7
aVIt's a norm. It's a social norm.
p8
aVBut it's a special kind of social norm,
p9
aVbecause it's a social norm that wants to tell us
p10
aVwho we can relate to and who we shouldn't relate to.
p11
aV"Don't talk to strangers" says,
p12
aV"Stay from anyone who's not familiar to you.
p13
aVStick with the people you know.
p14
aVStick with people like you."
p15
aa(lp16
VHow appealing is that?
p17
aVIt's not really what we do, is it, when we're at our best?
p18
aVWhen we're at our best, we reach out to people
p19
aVwho are not like us,
p20
aVbecause when we do that, we learn from people
p21
aVwho are not like us.
p22
aa(lp23
VMy phrase for this value of being with "not like us"
p24
aVis "strangeness,"
p25
aVand my point is that in today's digitally intensive world,
p26
aVstrangers are quite frankly not the point.
p27
aVThe point that we should be worried about is,
p28
aVhow much strangeness are we getting?
p29
aa(lp30
VWhy strangeness? Because our social relations
p31
aVare increasingly mediated by data,
p32
aVand data turns our social relations into digital relations,
p33
aVand that means that our digital relations
p34
aVnow depend extraordinarily on technology
p35
aVto bring to them a sense of robustness,
p36
aVa sense of discovery,
p37
aVa sense of surprise and unpredictability.
p38
aVWhy not strangers?
p39
aVBecause strangers are part of a world
p40
aVof really rigid boundaries.
p41
aVThey belong to a world of people I know
p42
aVversus people I don't know,
p43
aVand in the context of my digital relations,
p44
aVI'm already doing things with people I don't know.
p45
aVThe question isn't whether or not I know you.
p46
aVThe question is, what can I do with you?
p47
aVWhat can I learn with you?
p48
aVWhat can we do together that benefits us both?
p49
aa(lp50
VI spend a lot of time thinking about
p51
aVhow the social landscape is changing,
p52
aVhow new technologies create new constraints
p53
aVand new opportunities for people.
p54
aVThe most important changes facing us today
p55
aVhave to do with data and what data is doing
p56
aVto shape the kinds of digital relations
p57
aVthat will be possible for us in the future.
p58
aVThe economies of the future depend on that.
p59
aVOur social lives in the future depend on that.
p60
aVThe threat to worry about isn't strangers.
p61
aVThe threat to worry about is whether or not
p62
aVwe're getting our fair share of strangeness.
p63
aa(lp64
VNow, 20th-century psychologists and sociologists
p65
aVwere thinking about strangers,
p66
aVbut they weren't thinking so dynamically about human relations,
p67
aVand they were thinking about strangers
p68
aVin the context of influencing practices.
p69
aVStanley Milgram from the '60s and '70s,
p70
aVthe creator of the small-world experiments,
p71
aVwhich became later popularized as six degrees of separation,
p72
aVmade the point that any two arbitrarily selected people
p73
aVwere likely connected from between five to seven intermediary steps.
p74
aVHis point was that strangers are out there.
p75
aVWe can reach them. There are paths
p76
aVthat enable us to reach them.
p77
aVMark Granovetter, Stanford sociologist, in 1973
p78
aVin his seminal essay "The Strength of Weak Ties,"
p79
aVmade the point that these weak ties
p80
aVthat are a part of our networks, these strangers,
p81
aVare actually more effective at diffusing information to us
p82
aVthan are our strong ties, the people closest to us.
p83
aVHe makes an additional indictment of our strong ties
p84
aVwhen he says that these people who are so close to us,
p85
aVthese strong ties in our lives,
p86
aVactually have a homogenizing effect on us.
p87
aVThey produce sameness.
p88
aa(lp89
VMy colleagues and I at Intel have spent the last few years
p90
aVlooking at the ways in which digital platforms
p91
aVare reshaping our everyday lives,
p92
aVwhat kinds of new routines are possible.
p93
aVWe've been looking specifically at the kinds
p94
aVof digital platforms that have enabled us
p95
aVto take our possessions, those things that used to be
p96
aVvery restricted to us and to our friends in our houses,
p97
aVand to make them available to people we don't know.
p98
aVWhether it's our clothes, whether it's our cars,
p99
aVwhether it's our bikes, whether it's our books or music,
p100
aVwe are able to take our possessions now
p101
aVand make them available to people we've never met.
p102
aVAnd we concluded a very important insight,
p103
aVwhich was that as people's relationships
p104
aVto the things in their lives change,
p105
aVso do their relations with other people.
p106
aVAnd yet recommendation system
p107
aVafter recommendation system continues to miss the boat.
p108
aVIt continues to try to predict what I need
p109
aVbased on some past characterization of who I am,
p110
aVof what I've already done.
p111
aVSecurity technology after security technology
p112
aVcontinues to design data protection
p113
aVin terms of threats and attacks,
p114
aVkeeping me locked into really rigid kinds of relations.
p115
aa(lp116
VCategories like "friends" and "family"
p117
aVand "contacts" and "colleagues"
p118
aVdon't tell me anything about my actual relations.
p119
aVA more effective way to think about my relations
p120
aVmight be in terms of closeness and distance,
p121
aVwhere at any given point in time, with any single person,
p122
aVI am both close and distant from that individual,
p123
aVall as a function of what I need to do right now.
p124
aVPeople aren't close or distant.
p125
aVPeople are always a combination of the two,
p126
aVand that combination is constantly changing.
p127
aa(lp128
VWhat if technologies could intervene
p129
aVto disrupt the balance of certain kinds of relationships?
p130
aVWhat if technologies could intervene
p131
aVto help me find the person that I need right now?
p132
aVStrangeness is that calibration
p133
aVof closeness and distance
p134
aVthat enables me to find the people that I need right now,
p135
aVthat enables me to find the sources of intimacy,
p136
aVof discovery, and of inspiration that I need right now.
p137
aVStrangeness is not about meeting strangers.
p138
aVIt simply makes the point that we need
p139
aVto disrupt our zones of familiarity.
p140
aVSo jogging those zones of familiarity is one way to think about strangeness,
p141
aVand it's a problem faced not just by individuals today,
p142
aVbut also by organizations,
p143
aVorganizations that are trying to embrace massively new opportunities.
p144
aVWhether you're a political party
p145
aVinsisting to your detriment on a very rigid notion
p146
aVof who belongs and who does not,
p147
aVwhether you're the government
p148
aVprotecting social institutions like marriage
p149
aVand restricting access of those institutions to the few,
p150
aVwhether you're a teenager in her bedroom
p151
aVwho's trying to jostle her relations with her parents,
p152
aVstrangeness is a way to think about how we pave the way
p153
aVto new kinds of relations.
p154
aVWe have to change the norms.
p155
aVWe have to change the norms in order to enable
p156
aVnew kinds of technologies
p157
aVas a basis for new kinds of businesses.
p158
aa(lp159
VWhat interesting questions lie ahead for us
p160
aVin this world of no strangers?
p161
aVHow might we think differently about our relations with people?
p162
aVHow might we think differently about our relations
p163
aVwith distributed groups of people?
p164
aVHow might we think differently about our relations with technologies,
p165
aVthings that effectively become social participants
p166
aVin their own right?
p167
aVThe range of digital relations is extraordinary.
p168
aVIn the context of this broad range of digital relations,
p169
aVsafely seeking strangeness might very well be
p170
aVa new basis for that innovation.
