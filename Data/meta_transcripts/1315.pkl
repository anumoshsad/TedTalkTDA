VThere's currently over a thousand TED Talks on the TED website.
p4
aVAnd I guess many of you here think that this is quite fantastic,
p5
aVexcept for me, I don't agree with this.
p6
aVI think we have a situation here.
p7
aVBecause if you think about it, 1,000 TED Talks,
p8
aVthat's over 1,000 ideas worth spreading.
p9
aVHow on earth are you going to spread a thousand ideas?
p10
aVEven if you just try to get all of those ideas into your head
p11
aVby watching all those thousand TED videos,
p12
aVit would actually currently take you over 250 hours to do so.
p13
aVAnd I did a little calculation of this.
p14
aVThe damage to the economy for each one who does this is around $15,000.
p15
aVSo having seen this danger to the economy,
p16
aVI thought, we need to find a solution to this problem.
p17
aa(lp18
VHere's my approach to it all.
p19
aVIf you look at the current situation, you have a thousand TED Talks.
p20
aVEach of those TED Talks has an average length of about 2,300 words.
p21
aVNow take this together, and you end up with 2.3 million words of TED Talks,
p22
aVwhich is about three Bibles-worth of content.
p23
aa(lp24
V(Laughter)
p25
aa(lp26
VThe obvious question here is, does a TED Talk really need 2,300 words?
p27
aVIsn't there something shorter?
p28
aVI mean, if you have an idea worth spreading,
p29
aVsurely you can put it into something shorter than 2,300 words.
p30
aVThe only question is, how short can you get?
p31
aVWhat's the minimum amount of words you would need to do a TED Talk?
p32
aa(lp33
VWhile I was pondering this question,
p34
aVI came across this urban legend about Ernest Hemingway,
p35
aVwho allegedly said that these six words here:
p36
aV"For sale: baby shoes, never worn,"
p37
aVwere the best novel he had ever written.
p38
aVAnd I also encountered a project called Six-Word Memoirs
p39
aVwhere people were asked, take your whole life
p40
aVand please sum this up into six words, such as these here:
p41
aV"Found true love, married someone else."
p42
aVOr "Living in existential vacuum; it sucks."
p43
aVI actually like that one.
p44
aVSo if a novel can be put into six words
p45
aVand a whole memoir can be put into six words,
p46
aVyou don't need more than six words for a TED Talk.
p47
aVWe could have been done by lunch here.
p48
aa(lp49
V(Laughter)
p50
aa(lp51
VAnd if you did this for all thousand TED Talks,
p52
aVyou would get from 2.3 million words down to 6,000.
p53
aVSo I thought this was quite worthwhile.
p54
aa(lp55
VSo I started asking all my friends,
p56
aVplease take your favorite TED Talk and put that into six words.
p57
aVSo here are some of the results that I received.
p58
aVI think they're quite nice.
p59
aVFor example, Dan Pink's talk on motivation, which was pretty good,
p60
aVif you haven't seen it: "Drop carrot. Drop stick. Bring meaning."
p61
aVIt's what he's basically talking about in those 18,5 minutes.
p62
aVOr some even included references to the speakers,
p63
aVsuch as Nathan Myhrvold's speaking style, or the one of Tim Ferriss,
p64
aVwhich might be considered a bit strenuous at times.
p65
aa(lp66
VThe challenge here is, if I try to systematically do this,
p67
aVI would probably end up with a lot of summaries,
p68
aVbut not with many friends in the end.
p69
aVSo I had to find a different method, preferably involving total strangers.
p70
aVAnd luckily, there's a website for that, called Mechanical Turk,
p71
aVwhich is a website where you can post tasks
p72
aVthat you don't want to do yourself,
p73
aVsuch as "Please summarize this text for me in six words."
p74
aVAnd I didn't allow any low-cost countries to work on this,
p75
aVbut I found out I could get a six-word summary for just 10 cents,
p76
aVwhich I think is a pretty good price.
p77
aa(lp78
VEven then, unfortunately,
p79
aVit's not possible to summarize each TED Talk individually.
p80
aVBecause if you do the math, you have a thousand TED Talks,
p81
aVyou pay 10 cents each;
p82
aVyou have to do more than one summary for each of those talks,
p83
aVbecause some of them will probably be, or are, really bad.
p84
aVSo I would end up paying hundreds of dollars.
p85
aVSo I thought of a different way,
p86
aVby thinking, well, the talks revolve around certain themes.
p87
aVSo what if I don't let people summarize individual TED Talks to six words,
p88
aVbut give them 10 TED Talks at the same time
p89
aVand say, "Please do a six-word summary for that one."
p90
aVI would cut my costs by 90 percent.
p91
aVSo for $60,
p92
aVI could summarize a thousand TED Talks into just 600 summaries,
p93
aVwhich would actually be quite nice.
p94
aa(lp95
VSome of you might actually right now be thinking,
p96
aVit's downright crazy to have 10 TED Talks summarized into just six words.
p97
aVBut it's actually not,
p98
aVbecause there's an example by statistics professor Hans Rosling.
p99
aVI guess many of you have seen one or more of his talks.
p100
aVHe's got eight talks online,
p101
aVand those can basically be summed up into just four words,
p102
aVbecause that's all he's basically showing us, our intuition is really bad.
p103
aVHe always proves us wrong.
p104
aa(lp105
VSo people on the Internet, some didn't do so well.
p106
aVAnd when I asked them to summarize the 10 TED Talks at the same time,
p107
aVsome took the easy route out.
p108
aVThey just had some general comment.
p109
aVThere were others \u2014 and I found this quite cheeky \u2014
p110
aVThey used their six words to talk back to me
p111
aVand ask me if I'd been too much on Google lately.
p112
aa(lp113
V(Laughter)
p114
aa(lp115
VAnd finally also, I never understood this,
p116
aVsome people really came up with their own version of the truth.
p117
aVI don't know any TED Talk that contains this.
p118
aa(lp119
VBut, oh well.
p120
aVIn the end, however, and this is really amazing,
p121
aVfor each of those 10 TED Talk clusters that I submitted,
p122
aVI actually received meaningful summaries.
p123
aVHere are some of my favorites.
p124
aVFor example, for the TED Talks about food,
p125
aVsomeone summed this up into: "Food shaping body, brains and environment,"
p126
aVwhich I think is pretty good.
p127
aVOr happiness: "Striving toward happiness = moving toward unhappiness."
p128
aa(lp129
VSo here I was.
p130
aVI had started out with a thousand TED Talks
p131
aVand I had 600 six-word summaries for those.
p132
aVActually, it sounded nice in the beginning,
p133
aVbut when you look at 600 summaries, it's quite a lot, it's a huge list.
p134
aa(lp135
V(Laughter)
p136
aa(lp137
VSo I thought, I probably have to take this one step further here
p138
aVand create summaries of the summaries, and this is exactly what I did.
p139
aVSo I took the 600 summaries that I had, put them into nine groups
p140
aVaccording to the ratings that the talks had originally received on TED.com
p141
aVand asked people to do summaries of those.
p142
aVAgain, there were some misunderstandings.
p143
aVFor example, when I had a cluster of all the "Beautiful" talks,
p144
aVsomeone thought I was just trying to find the ultimate pick-up line.
p145
aVBut in the end, amazingly,
p146
aVagain, people were able to do it.
p147
aVFor example, all the courageous TED Talks:
p148
aV"People dying" or "People suffering" was also one,
p149
aV"with easy solutions around."
p150
aVOr the recipe for the ultimate jaw-dropping TED Talk:
p151
aV"Flickr photos of intergalactic classical composer."
p152
aVI mean that's the essence of it all.
p153
aa(lp154
VNow I had my nine groups, but, I mean, it's already quite a reduction.
p155
aVBut of course, once you are that far, you're not really satisfied.
p156
aVI wanted to go all the way, all the way down the distillery,
p157
aVstarting out with a thousand TED Talks.
p158
aVI wanted to have a thousand TED Talks summarized into just six words \u2014
p159
aVwhich would be a 99.9997 percent reduction in content.
p160
aVAnd I would only pay $99.50 \u2014
p161
aVso stay even below $100 for it.
p162
aa(lp163
VSo I had 50 overall summaries done.
p164
aVThis time I paid 25 cents
p165
aVbecause I thought the task was a bit harder.
p166
aVAnd unfortunately, when I first received the answers \u2014
p167
aVand here, you'll see six of the answers \u2014 I was a bit disappointed.
p168
aVBecause I think you'll agree, they all summarize some aspect of TED,
p169
aVbut to me, they felt a bit bland,
p170
aVor they just had a certain aspect of TED in them.
p171
aVSo I was almost ready to give up
p172
aVwhen one night, I played around with these sentences
p173
aVand found out that there's actually a beautiful solution in here.
p174
aVSo here it is,
p175
aVa crowd-sourced, six-word summary of a thousand TED Talks
p176
aVat the value of $99.50:
p177
aV"Why the worry? I'd rather wonder."
p178
aa(lp179
VThank you very much.
