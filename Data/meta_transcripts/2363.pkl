VWhen I was a kid, my parents would tell me,
p4
aV"You can make a mess, but you have to clean up after yourself."
p5
aVSo freedom came with responsibility.
p6
aVBut my imagination would take me to all these wonderful places,
p7
aVwhere everything was possible.
p8
aVSo I grew up in a bubble of innocence \u2014
p9
aVor a bubble of ignorance, I should say,
p10
aVbecause adults would lie to us to protect us from the ugly truth.
p11
aVAnd growing up, I found out that adults make a mess,
p12
aVand they're not very good at cleaning up after themselves.
p13
aa(lp14
VFast forward, I am an adult now,
p15
aVand I teach citizen science and invention at the Hong Kong Harbour School.
p16
aVAnd it doesn't take too long
p17
aVbefore my students walk on a beach and stumble upon piles of trash.
p18
aVSo as good citizens, we clean up the beaches \u2014
p19
aVand no, he is not drinking alcohol, and if he is, I did not give it to him.
p20
aa(lp21
V(Laughter)
p22
aa(lp23
VAnd so it's sad to say,
p24
aVbut today more than 80 percent  of the oceans have plastic in them.
p25
aVIt's a horrifying fact.
p26
aVAnd in past decades,
p27
aVwe've been taking those big ships out and those big nets,
p28
aVand we collect those plastic bits that we look at under a microscope,
p29
aVand we sort them,
p30
aVand then we put this data onto a map.
p31
aVBut that takes forever, it's very expensive,
p32
aVand so it's quite risky to take those big boats out.
p33
aa(lp34
VSo with my students, ages six to 15,
p35
aVwe've been dreaming of inventing a better way.
p36
aVSo we've transformed our tiny Hong Kong classroom into a workshop.
p37
aVAnd so we started building this small workbench,
p38
aVwith different heights, so even really short kids can participate.
p39
aVAnd let me tell you, kids with power tools are awesome and safe.
p40
aa(lp41
V(Laughter)
p42
aa(lp43
VNot really.
p44
aVAnd so, back to plastic.
p45
aVWe collect this plastic and we grind it to the size we find it in the ocean,
p46
aVwhich is very small because it breaks down.
p47
aVAnd so this is how we work.
p48
aVI let the imaginations of my students run wild.
p49
aVAnd my job is to try to collect the best of each kid's idea
p50
aVand try to combine it into something that hopefully would work.
p51
aVAnd so we have agreed that instead of collecting plastic bits,
p52
aVwe are going to collect only the data.
p53
aVSo we're going to get an image of the plastic with a robot \u2014
p54
aVso robots, kids get very excited.
p55
aVAnd the next thing we do \u2014 we do what we call "rapid prototyping."
p56
aVWe are so rapid at prototyping
p57
aVthat the lunch is still in the lunchbox when we're hacking it.
p58
aa(lp59
V(Laughter)
p60
aa(lp61
VAnd we hack table lamps and webcams, into plumbing fixtures
p62
aVand we assemble that into a floating robot that will be slowly moving through water
p63
aVand through the plastic that we have there \u2014
p64
aVand this is the image that we get in the robot.
p65
aVSo we see the plastic pieces floating slowly through the sensor,
p66
aVand the computer on board will process this image,
p67
aVand measure the size of each particle,
p68
aVso we have a rough estimate of how much plastic there is in the water.
p69
aa(lp70
VSo we documented this invention step by step
p71
aVon a website for inventors called Instructables,
p72
aVin the hope that somebody would make it even better.
p73
aa(lp74
VWhat was really cool about this project was that the students saw a local problem,
p75
aVand boom \u2014 they are trying to immediately address it.
p76
aa(lp77
V[I can investigate my local problem]
p78
aa(lp79
VBut my students in Hong Kong are hyperconnected kids.
p80
aVAnd they watch the news, they watch the Internet,
p81
aVand they came across this image.
p82
aVThis was a child, probably under 10, cleaning up an oil spill bare-handed,
p83
aVin the Sundarbans, which is the world's largest mangrove forest in Bangladesh.
p84
aVSo they were very shocked,
p85
aVbecause this is the water they drink, this is the water they bathe in,
p86
aVthis is the water they fish in \u2014 this is the place where they live.
p87
aVAnd also you can see the water is brown, the mud is brown and oil is brown,
p88
aVso when everything is mixed up,
p89
aVit's really hard to see what's in the water.
p90
aVBut, there's a technology that's rather simple,
p91
aVthat's called spectrometry,
p92
aVthat allows you see what's in the water.
p93
aVSo we built a rough prototype of a spectrometer,
p94
aVand you can shine light through different substances
p95
aVthat produce different spectrums,
p96
aVso that can help you identify what's in the water.
p97
aVSo we packed this prototype of a sensor,
p98
aVand we shipped it to Bangladesh.
p99
aVSo what was cool about this project
p100
aVwas that beyond addressing a local problem,
p101
aVor looking at a local problem,
p102
aVmy students used their empathy and their sense of being creative
p103
aVto help, remotely, other kids.
p104
aa(lp105
V[I can investigate a remote problem]
p106
aa(lp107
VSo I was very compelled by doing the second experiments,
p108
aVand I wanted to take it even further \u2014
p109
aVmaybe addressing an even harder problem, and it's also closer to my heart.
p110
aa(lp111
VSo I'm half Japanese and half French,
p112
aVand maybe you remember in 2011 there was a massive earthquake in Japan.
p113
aVIt was so violent that it triggered several giant waves \u2014
p114
aVthey are called tsunami \u2014
p115
aVand those tsunami destroyed many cities on the eastern coast of Japan.
p116
aVMore than 14,000 people died in an instant.
p117
aVAlso, it damaged the nuclear power plant of Fukushima,
p118
aVthe nuclear power plant just by the water.
p119
aVAnd today, I read the reports
p120
aVand an average of 300 tons
p121
aVare leaking from the nuclear power plant into the Pacific Ocean.
p122
aVAnd today the whole Pacific Ocean has traces of contamination of cesium-137.
p123
aVIf you go outside on the West Coast, you can measure Fukushima everywhere.
p124
aVBut if you look at the map, it can look like most of the radioactivity
p125
aVhas been washed away from the Japanese coast,
p126
aVand most of it is now \u2014 it looks like it's safe, it's blue.
p127
aVWell, reality is a bit more complicated than this.
p128
aa(lp129
VSo I've been going to Fukushima every year since the accident,
p130
aVand I measure independently and with other scientists,
p131
aVon land, in the river \u2014
p132
aVand this time we wanted to take the kids.
p133
aVSo of course we didn't take the kids, the parents wouldn't allow that to happen.
p134
aa(lp135
V(Laughter)
p136
aa(lp137
VBut every night we would report to "Mission Control" \u2014
p138
aVdifferent masks they're wearing.
p139
aVIt could look like they didn't take the work seriously, but they really did
p140
aVbecause they're going to have to live with radioactivity their whole life.
p141
aVAnd so what we did with them
p142
aVis that we'd discuss the data we collected that day,
p143
aVand talk about where we should be going next \u2014
p144
aVstrategy, itinerary, etc...
p145
aVAnd to do this, we built a very rough topographical map
p146
aVof the region around the nuclear power plant.
p147
aVAnd so we built the elevation map,
p148
aVwe sprinkled pigments to represent real-time data for radioactivity,
p149
aVand we sprayed water to simulate the rainfall.
p150
aVAnd with this we could see that the radioactive dust
p151
aVwas washing from the top of the mountain into the river system,
p152
aVand leaking into the ocean.
p153
aVSo it was a rough estimate.
p154
aa(lp155
VBut with this in mind, we organized this expedition,
p156
aVwhich was the closest civilians have been to the nuclear power plant.
p157
aVWe are sailing 1.5 kilometers away from the nuclear power plant,
p158
aVand with the help of the local fisherman,
p159
aVwe are collecting sediment from the seabed
p160
aVwith a custom sediment sampler we've invented and built.
p161
aVWe pack the sediment into small bags,
p162
aVwe then dispatch them to hundreds of small bags
p163
aVthat we send to different universities,
p164
aVand we produce the map of the seabed radioactivity,
p165
aVespecially in estuaries where the fish will reproduce,
p166
aVand I will hope that we will have improved
p167
aVthe safety of the local fishermen and of your favorite sushi.
p168
aa(lp169
V(Laughter)
p170
aa(lp171
VYou can see a progression here \u2014
p172
aVwe've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
p173
aVAnd it's been super exciting to work at these different scales,
p174
aVwith also very simple, open-source technologies.
p175
aVBut at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating
p176
aVbecause we have only started to measure the damage that we have done.
p177
aVWe haven't even started to try to solve the problems.
p178
aVAnd so I wonder if we should just take a leap
p179
aVand try to invent better ways to do all these things.
p180
aa(lp181
VAnd so the classroom started to feel a little bit small,
p182
aVso we found an industrial site in Hong Kong,
p183
aVand we turned it into the largest mega-space
p184
aVfocused on social and environmental impact.
p185
aVIt's in central Hong Kong,
p186
aVand it's a place we can work with wood, metal, chemistry,
p187
aVa bit of biology, a bit of optics,
p188
aVbasically you can build pretty much everything there.
p189
aVAnd its a place where adults and kids can play together.
p190
aVIt's a place where kids' dreams can come true,
p191
aVwith the help of adults,
p192
aVand where adults can be kids again.
p193
aa(lp194
VStudent: Acceleration! Acceleration!
p195
aa(lp196
VCesar Harada: We're asking questions such as,
p197
aVcan we invent the future of mobility with renewable energy?
p198
aVFor example.
p199
aVOr, can we help the mobility of the aging population
p200
aVby transforming very standard wheelchairs into cool, electric vehicles?
p201
aa(lp202
VSo plastic, oil and radioactivity are horrible, horrible legacies,
p203
aVbut the very worst legacy that we can leave our children is lies.
p204
aVWe can no longer afford to shield the kids from the ugly truth
p205
aVbecause we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
p206
aa(lp207
VSo citizen scientists, makers, dreamers \u2014
p208
aVwe must prepare the next generation
p209
aVthat cares about the environment and people,
p210
aVand that can actually do something about it.
p211
