VJoseph Keller used to jog around the Stanford campus,
p4
aVand he was struck by all the women jogging there as well.
p5
aVWhy did their ponytails swing from side to side like that?
p6
aVBeing a mathematician, he set out to understand why.
p7
aa(lp8
V(Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
VProfessor Keller was curious about many things:
p11
aVwhy teapots dribble
p12
aVor how earthworms wriggle.
p13
aVUntil a few months ago, I hadn't heard of Joseph Keller.
p14
aVI read about him in the New York Times,
p15
aVin the obituaries.
p16
aVThe Times had half a page of editorial dedicated to him,
p17
aVwhich you can imagine is premium space for a newspaper of their stature.
p18
aa(lp19
VI read the obituaries almost every day.
p20
aVMy wife understandably thinks I'm rather morbid
p21
aVto begin my day with scrambled eggs and a "Let's see who died today."
p22
aa(lp23
V(Laughter)
p24
aa(lp25
VBut if you think about it,
p26
aVthe front page of the newspaper is usually bad news,
p27
aVand cues man's failures.
p28
aVAn instance where bad news cues accomplishment
p29
aVis at the end of the paper, in the obituaries.
p30
aa(lp31
VIn my day job,
p32
aVI run a company that focuses on future insights
p33
aVthat marketers can derive from past data \u2014
p34
aVa kind of rearview-mirror analysis.
p35
aVAnd we began to think:
p36
aVWhat if we held a rearview mirror to obituaries from the New York Times?
p37
aVWere there lessons on how you could get your obituary featured \u2014
p38
aVeven if you aren't around to enjoy it?
p39
aa(lp40
V(Laughter)
p41
aa(lp42
VWould this go better with scrambled eggs?
p43
aa(lp44
V(Laughter)
p45
aa(lp46
VAnd so, we looked at the data.
p47
aV2,000 editorial, non-paid obituaries
p48
aVover a 20-month period between 2015 and 2016.
p49
aVWhat did these 2,000 deaths \u2014 rather, lives \u2014 teach us?
p50
aa(lp51
VWell, first we looked at words.
p52
aVThis here is an obituary headline.
p53
aVThis one is of the amazing Lee Kuan Yew.
p54
aVIf you remove the beginning and the end,
p55
aVyou're left with a beautifully worded descriptor
p56
aVthat tries to, in just a few words, capture an achievement or a lifetime.
p57
aVJust looking at these is fascinating.
p58
aVHere are a few famous ones, people who died in the last two years.
p59
aVTry and guess who they are.
p60
aa(lp61
V[An Artist who Defied Genre]
p62
aVThat's Prince.
p63
aa(lp64
V[Titan of Boxing and the 20th Century]
p65
aVOh, yes.
p66
aa(lp67
V[Muhammad Ali]
p68
aa(lp69
V[Groundbreaking Architect]
p70
aVZaha Hadid.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo we took these descriptors
p73
aVand did what's called natural language processing,
p74
aVwhere you feed these into a program,
p75
aVit throws out the superfluous words \u2014
p76
aV"the," "and," \u2014 the kind of words you can mime easily in "Charades," \u2014
p77
aVand leaves you with the most significant words.
p78
aVAnd we did it not just for these four,
p79
aVbut for all 2,000 descriptors.
p80
aVAnd this is what it looks like.
p81
aVFilm, theatre, music, dance and of course, art, are huge.
p82
aVOver 40 percent.
p83
aVYou have to wonder why in so many societies
p84
aVwe insist that our kids pursue engineering or medicine or business or law
p85
aVto be construed as successful.
p86
aVAnd while we're talking profession,
p87
aVlet's look at age \u2014
p88
aVthe average age at which they achieved things.
p89
aVThat number is 37.
p90
aVWhat that means is, you've got to wait 37 years ...
p91
aVbefore your first significant achievement that you're remembered for \u2014
p92
aVon average \u2014
p93
aV44 years later, when you die at the age of 81 \u2014
p94
aVon average.
p95
aa(lp96
V(Laughter)
p97
aa(lp98
VTalk about having to be patient.
p99
aa(lp100
V(Laughter)
p101
aa(lp102
VOf course, it varies by profession.
p103
aVIf you're a sports star,
p104
aVyou'll probably hit your stride in your 20s.
p105
aVAnd if you're in your 40s like me,
p106
aVyou can join the fun world of politics.
p107
aa(lp108
V(Laughter)
p109
aa(lp110
VPoliticians do their first and sometimes only commendable act in their mid-40s.
p111
aa(lp112
V(Laughter)
p113
aa(lp114
VIf you're wondering what "others" are,
p115
aVhere are some examples.
p116
aVIsn't it fascinating, the things people do
p117
aVand the things they're remembered for?
p118
aa(lp119
V(Laughter)
p120
aa(lp121
VOur curiosity was in overdrive,
p122
aVand we desired to analyze more than just a descriptor.
p123
aVSo, we ingested the entire first paragraph of all 2,000 obituaries,
p124
aVbut we did this separately for two groups of people:
p125
aVpeople that are famous and people that are not famous.
p126
aVFamous people \u2014 Prince, Ali, Zaha Hadid \u2014
p127
aVpeople who are not famous are people like Jocelyn Cooper,
p128
aVReverend Curry
p129
aVor Lorna Kelly.
p130
aVI'm willing to bet you haven't heard of most of their names.
p131
aVAmazing people, fantastic achievements, but they're not famous.
p132
aVSo what if we analyze these two groups separately \u2014
p133
aVthe famous and the non-famous?
p134
aVWhat might that tell us?
p135
aa(lp136
VTake a look.
p137
aVTwo things leap out at me.
p138
aVFirst:
p139
aV"John."
p140
aa(lp141
V(Laughter)
p142
aa(lp143
VAnyone here named John should thank your parents \u2014
p144
aa(lp145
V(Laughter)
p146
aa(lp147
Vand remind your kids to cut out your obituary when you're gone.
p148
aVAnd second:
p149
aV"help."
p150
aa(lp151
VWe uncovered, many lessons from lives well-led,
p152
aVand what those people immortalized in print could teach us.
p153
aVThe exercise was a fascinating testament to the kaleidoscope that is life,
p154
aVand even more fascinating
p155
aVwas the fact that the overwhelming majority of obituaries
p156
aVfeatured people famous and non-famous,
p157
aVwho did seemingly extraordinary things.
p158
aVThey made a positive dent in the fabric of life.
p159
aVThey helped.
p160
aa(lp161
VSo ask yourselves as you go back to your daily lives:
p162
aVHow am I using my talents to help society?
p163
aVBecause the most powerful lesson here is,
p164
aVif more people lived their lives trying to be famous in death,
p165
aVthe world would be a much better place.
p166
aa(lp167
VThank you.
