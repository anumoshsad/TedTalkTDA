VFifteen years ago, it was widely assumed
p4
aVthat the vast majority of brain development
p5
aVtakes place in the first few years of life.
p6
aVBack then, 15 years ago, we didn't have the ability
p7
aVto look inside the living human brain
p8
aVand track development across the lifespan.
p9
aVIn the past decade or so, mainly due to advances
p10
aVin brain imaging technology
p11
aVsuch as magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI,
p12
aVneuroscientists have started to look inside the living
p13
aVhuman brain of all ages, and to track changes
p14
aVin brain structure and brain function,
p15
aVso we use structural MRI if you'd like to take a snapshot,
p16
aVa photograph, at really high resolution of the inside
p17
aVof the living human brain, and we can ask questions like,
p18
aVhow much gray matter does the brain contain,
p19
aVand how does that change with age?
p20
aVAnd we also use functional MRI, called fMRI,
p21
aVto take a video, a movie, of brain activity
p22
aVwhen participants are taking part in some kind of task
p23
aVlike thinking or feeling or perceiving something.
p24
aa(lp25
VSo many labs around the world are involved in this kind
p26
aVof research, and we now have a really rich
p27
aVand detailed picture of how the living human brain develops,
p28
aVand this picture has radically changed the way
p29
aVwe think about human brain development
p30
aVby revealing that it's not all over in early childhood,
p31
aVand instead, the brain continues to develop
p32
aVright throughout adolescence and into the '20s and '30s.
p33
aa(lp34
VSo adolescence is defined as the period of life that starts
p35
aVwith the biological, hormonal, physical changes of puberty
p36
aVand ends at the age at which an individual attains
p37
aVa stable, independent role in society.
p38
aV(Laughter)
p39
aVIt can go on a long time. (Laughter)
p40
aVOne of the brain regions that changes most dramatically
p41
aVduring adolescence is called prefrontal cortex.
p42
aVSo this is a model of the human brain,
p43
aVand this is prefrontal cortex, right at the front.
p44
aVPrefrontal cortex is an interesting brain area.
p45
aVIt's proportionally much bigger in humans than
p46
aVin any other species, and it's involved in a whole range of
p47
aVhigh level cognitive functions, things like decision-making,
p48
aVplanning, planning what you're going to do tomorrow
p49
aVor next week or next year, inhibiting
p50
aVinappropriate behavior, so stopping yourself saying
p51
aVsomething really rude or doing something really stupid.
p52
aVIt's also involved in social interaction,
p53
aVunderstanding other people, and self-awareness.
p54
aa(lp55
VSo MRI studies looking at the development of this region
p56
aVhave shown that it really undergoes dramatic development
p57
aVduring the period of adolescence.
p58
aVSo if you look at gray matter volume, for example,
p59
aVgray matter volume across age from age four to 22 years
p60
aVincreases during childhood, which is what you can see
p61
aVon this graph. It peaks in early adolescence.
p62
aVThe arrows indicate peak gray matter volume
p63
aVin prefrontal cortex. You can see that that peak happens
p64
aVa couple of years later in boys relative to girls,
p65
aVand that's probably because boys go through puberty
p66
aVa couple of years later than girls on average,
p67
aVand then during adolescence, there's a significant decline
p68
aVin gray matter volume in prefrontal cortex.
p69
aVNow that might sound bad, but actually this is
p70
aVa really important developmental process, because
p71
aVgray matter contains cell bodies and connections
p72
aVbetween cells, the synapses, and this decline
p73
aVin gray matter volume during prefrontal cortex
p74
aVis thought to correspond to synaptic pruning,
p75
aVthe elimination of unwanted synapses.
p76
aVThis is a really important process. It's partly dependent
p77
aVon the environment that the animal or the human is in,
p78
aVand the synapses that are being used are strengthened,
p79
aVand synapses that aren't being used
p80
aVin that particular environment are pruned away.
p81
aVYou can think of it a bit like pruning a rosebush.
p82
aVYou prune away the weaker branches so that
p83
aVthe remaining, important branches, can grow stronger,
p84
aVand this process, which effectively fine-tunes brain tissue
p85
aVaccording to the species-specific environment,
p86
aVis happening in prefrontal cortex and in other brain regions
p87
aVduring the period of human adolescence.
p88
aa(lp89
VSo a second line of inquiry that we use to track changes
p90
aVin the adolescent brain is using functional MRI
p91
aVto look at changes in brain activity across age.
p92
aVSo I'll just give you an example from my lab.
p93
aVSo in my lab, we're interested in the social brain, that is
p94
aVthe network of brain regions that we use to understand
p95
aVother people and to interact with other people.
p96
aVSo I like to show a photograph of a soccer game
p97
aVto illustrate two aspects of how your social brains work.
p98
aVSo this is a soccer game. (Laughter)
p99
aVMichael Owen has just missed a goal, and he's lying
p100
aVon the ground, and the first aspect of the social brain
p101
aVthat this picture really nicely illustrates is how automatic
p102
aVand instinctive social emotional responses are,
p103
aVso within a split second of Michael Owen missing this goal,
p104
aVeveryone is doing the same thing with their arms
p105
aVand the same thing with their face, even Michael Owen
p106
aVas he slides along the grass, is doing the same thing
p107
aVwith his arms, and presumably has a similar
p108
aVfacial expression, and the only people who don't
p109
aVare the guys in yellow at the back \u2014 (Laughs) \u2014
p110
aVand I think they're on the wrong end of the stadium,
p111
aVand they're doing another social emotional response
p112
aVthat we all instantly recognize, and that's the second aspect
p113
aVof the social brain that this picture really nicely illustrates,
p114
aVhow good we are at reading other people's behavior,
p115
aVtheir actions, their gestures, their facial expressions,
p116
aVin terms of their underlying emotions and mental states.
p117
aVSo you don't have to ask any of these guys.
p118
aVYou have a pretty good idea of what they're feeling
p119
aVand thinking at this precise moment in time.
p120
aa(lp121
VSo that's what we're interested in looking at in my lab.
p122
aVSo in my lab, we bring adolescents and adults into the lab
p123
aVto have a brain scan, we give them some kind of task
p124
aVthat involves thinking about other people, their minds,
p125
aVtheir mental states, their emotions, and one of the findings
p126
aVthat we've found several times now, as have other labs
p127
aVaround the world, is part of the prefrontal cortex called
p128
aVmedial prefrontal cortex, which is shown in blue on the slide,
p129
aVand it's right in the middle of prefrontal cortex
p130
aVin the midline of your head.
p131
aVThis region is more active in adolescents when they make
p132
aVthese social decisions and think about other people
p133
aVthan it is in adults, and this is actually a meta-analysis
p134
aVof nine different studies in this area from labs around
p135
aVthe world, and they all show the same thing, that activity
p136
aVin this medial prefrontal cortex area decreases
p137
aVduring the period of adolescence.
p138
aVAnd we think that might be because adolescents and adults
p139
aVuse a different mental approach, a different
p140
aVcognitive strategy, to make social decisions,
p141
aVand one way of looking at that is to do behavioral studies
p142
aVwhereby we bring people into the lab and we give them
p143
aVsome kind of behavioral task, and I'll just give you
p144
aVanother example of the kind of task that we use in my lab.
p145
aa(lp146
VSo imagine that you're the participant in one of our
p147
aVexperiments. You come into the lab,
p148
aVyou see this computerized task.
p149
aVIn this task, you see a set of shelves.
p150
aVNow, there are objects on these shelves, on some of them,
p151
aVand you'll notice there's a guy standing behind the set
p152
aVof shelves, and there are some objects that he can't see.
p153
aVThey're occluded, from his point of view, with a kind of
p154
aVgray piece of wood.
p155
aVThis is the same set of shelves from his point of view.
p156
aVNotice that there are only some objects that he can see,
p157
aVwhereas there are many more objects that you can see.
p158
aVNow your task is to move objects around.
p159
aVThe director, standing behind the set of shelves,
p160
aVis going to direct you to move objects around,
p161
aVbut remember, he's not going to ask you to move objects
p162
aVthat he can't see. This introduces a really interesting
p163
aVcondition whereby there's a kind of conflict
p164
aVbetween your perspective and the director's perspective.
p165
aVSo imagine he tells you to move the top truck left.
p166
aVThere are three trucks there. You're going to instinctively
p167
aVgo for the white truck, because that's the top truck
p168
aVfrom your perspective, but then you have to remember,
p169
aV"Oh, he can't see that truck, so he must mean
p170
aVme to move the blue truck," which is the top truck
p171
aVfrom his perspective. Now believe it or not,
p172
aVnormal, healthy, intelligent adults like you make errors
p173
aVabout 50 percent of the time on that kind of trial.
p174
aVThey move the white truck instead of the blue truck.
p175
aVSo we give this kind of task to adolescents and adults,
p176
aVand we also have a control condition
p177
aVwhere there's no director and instead we give people a rule.
p178
aVWe tell them, okay, we're going to do exactly the same thing
p179
aVbut this time there's no director. Instead you've got to
p180
aVignore objects with the dark gray background.
p181
aVYou'll see that this is exactly the same condition, only
p182
aVin the no-director condition they just have to remember
p183
aVto apply this somewhat arbitrary rule, whereas
p184
aVin the director condition, they have to remember
p185
aVto take into account the director's perspective
p186
aVin order to guide their ongoing behavior.
p187
aa(lp188
VOkay, so if I just show you the percentage errors
p189
aVin a large developmental study we did,
p190
aVthis is in a study ranging from age seven to adulthood,
p191
aVand what you're going to see is the percentage errors
p192
aVin the adult group in both conditions,
p193
aVso the gray is the director condition, and you see
p194
aVthat our intelligent adults are making errors about 50 percent
p195
aVof the time, whereas they make far fewer errors
p196
aVwhen there's no director present, when they just have
p197
aVto remember that rule of ignoring the gray background.
p198
aVDevelopmentally, these two conditions develop
p199
aVin exactly the same way. Between late childhood
p200
aVand mid-adolescence, there's an improvement,
p201
aVin other words a reduction of errors, in both of these trials,
p202
aVin both of these conditions.
p203
aVBut it's when you compare the last two groups,
p204
aVthe mid-adolescent group and the adult group
p205
aVwhere things get really interesting, because there, there is
p206
aVno continued improvement in the no-director condition.
p207
aVIn other words, everything you need to do in order to
p208
aVremember the rule and apply it seems to be fully developed
p209
aVby mid-adolescence, whereas in contrast,
p210
aVif you look at the last two gray bars, there's still
p211
aVa significant improvement in the director condition
p212
aVbetween mid-adolescence and adulthood, and what
p213
aVthis means is that the ability to take into account someone
p214
aVelse's perspective in order to guide ongoing behavior,
p215
aVwhich is something, by the way, that we do in everyday life all
p216
aVthe time, is still developing in mid-to-late adolescence.
p217
aVSo if you have a teenage son or a daughter and you
p218
aVsometimes think they have problems taking other people's
p219
aVperspectives, you're right. They do. And this is why.
p220
aa(lp221
VSo we sometimes laugh about teenagers.
p222
aVThey're parodied, sometimes even demonized in the media
p223
aVfor their kind of typical teenage behavior. They take risks,
p224
aVthey're sometimes moody, they're very self-conscious.
p225
aVI have a really nice anecdote from a friend of mine
p226
aVwho said that the thing he noticed most
p227
aVabout his teenage daughters before and after puberty
p228
aVwas their level of embarrassment in front of him.
p229
aVSo, he said, "Before puberty, if my two daughters
p230
aVwere messing around in a shop, I'd say, 'Hey,
p231
aVstop messing around and I'll sing your favorite song,'
p232
aVand instantly they'd stop messing around and he'd sing
p233
aVtheir favorite song. After puberty, that became the threat.
p234
aV(Laughter)
p235
aVThe very notion of their dad singing in public
p236
aVwas enough to make them behave.
p237
aa(lp238
VSo people often ask,
p239
aV"Well, is adolescence a kind of recent phenomenon?
p240
aVIs it something we've invented recently in the West?"
p241
aVAnd actually, the answer is probably not. There are lots
p242
aVof descriptions of adolescence in history that sound
p243
aVvery similar to the descriptions we use today.
p244
aa(lp245
VSo there's a famous quote by Shakespeare from "The Winter's Tale"
p246
aVwhere he describes adolescence as follows:
p247
aV"I would there were no age between ten and
p248
aVthree-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the rest;
p249
aVfor there is nothing in the between but getting wenches
p250
aVwith child, wronging the ancientry, stealing, fighting." (Laughter)
p251
aVHe then goes on to say, "Having said that, would any
p252
aVbut these boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty
p253
aVhunt in this weather?" (Laughter)
p254
aVSo almost 400 years ago, Shakespeare was portraying
p255
aVadolescents in a very similar light to the light that we
p256
aVportray them in today, but today we try to understand
p257
aVtheir behavior in terms of the underlying changes
p258
aVthat are going on in their brain.
p259
aa(lp260
VSo for example, take risk-taking. We know that adolescents
p261
aVhave a tendency to take risks. They do.
p262
aVThey take more risks than children or adults,
p263
aVand they are particularly prone to taking risks
p264
aVwhen they're with their friends. There's an important drive
p265
aVto become independent from one's parents
p266
aVand to impress one's friends in adolescence.
p267
aVBut now we try to understand that in terms of
p268
aVthe development of a part of their brain called the limbic system,
p269
aVso I'm going to show you the limbic system in red
p270
aVin the slide behind me, and also on this brain.
p271
aVSo the limbic system is right deep inside the brain,
p272
aVand it's involved in things like emotion processing
p273
aVand reward processing. It gives you the rewarding feeling
p274
aVout of doing fun things, including taking risks.
p275
aVIt gives you the kick out of taking risks.
p276
aVAnd this region, the regions within the limbic system,
p277
aVhave been found to be hypersensitive to the rewarding
p278
aVfeeling of risk-taking in adolescents compared with adults,
p279
aVand at the very same time, the prefrontal cortex,
p280
aVwhich you can see in blue in the slide here,
p281
aVwhich stops us taking excessive risks,
p282
aVis still very much in development in adolescents.
p283
aa(lp284
VSo brain research has shown that the adolescent brain
p285
aVundergoes really quite profound development,
p286
aVand this has implications for education, for rehabilitation,
p287
aVand intervention. The environment, including teaching,
p288
aVcan and does shape the developing adolescent brain,
p289
aVand yet it's only relatively recently that we have been
p290
aVroutinely educating teenagers in the West.
p291
aVAll four of my grandparents, for example, left school
p292
aVin their early adolescence. They had no choice.
p293
aVAnd that's still the case for many, many teenagers
p294
aVaround the world today. Forty percent of teenagers
p295
aVdon't have access to secondary school education.
p296
aVAnd yet, this is a period of life where the brain is
p297
aVparticularly adaptable and malleable.
p298
aVIt's a fantastic opportunity for learning and creativity.
p299
aa(lp300
VSo what's sometimes seen as the problem
p301
aVwith adolescents \u2014 heightened risk-taking, poor impulse
p302
aVcontrol, self-consciousness \u2014 shouldn't be stigmatized.
p303
aVIt actually reflects changes in the brain that provide
p304
aVan excellent opportunity for education
p305
aVand social development. Thank you. (Applause)
