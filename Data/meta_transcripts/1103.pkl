VToday I want to talk about design,
p4
aVbut not design as we usually think about it.
p5
aVI want to talk about what is happening now
p6
aVin our scientific, biotechnological culture,
p7
aVwhere, for really the first time in history,
p8
aVwe have the power to design bodies,
p9
aVto design animal bodies,
p10
aVto design human bodies.
p11
aVIn the history of our planet,
p12
aVthere have been three great waves of evolution.
p13
aa(lp14
VThe first wave of evolution
p15
aVis what we think of as Darwinian evolution.
p16
aVSo, as you all know,
p17
aVspecies lived in particular ecological niches
p18
aVand particular environments,
p19
aVand the pressures of those environments
p20
aVselected which changes,
p21
aVthrough random mutation in species,
p22
aVwere going to be preserved.
p23
aVThen human beings stepped out
p24
aVof the Darwinian flow of evolutionary history
p25
aVand created the second great wave of evolution,
p26
aVwhich was we changed the environment
p27
aVin which we evolved.
p28
aVWe altered our ecological niche
p29
aVby creating civilization.
p30
aVAnd that has been the second great \u2014
p31
aVcouple 100,000 years, 150,000 years \u2014
p32
aVflow of our evolution.
p33
aVBy changing our environment,
p34
aVwe put new pressures
p35
aVon our bodies to evolve.
p36
aVWhether it was through settling down in agricultural communities,
p37
aVall the way through modern medicine,
p38
aVwe have changed our own evolution.
p39
aVNow we're entering a third great wave
p40
aVof evolutionary history,
p41
aVwhich has been called many things:
p42
aV"intentional evolution,"
p43
aV"evolution by design" \u2014
p44
aVvery different than intelligent design \u2014
p45
aVwhereby we are actually now
p46
aVintentionally designing and altering
p47
aVthe physiological forms that inhabit our planet.
p48
aa(lp49
VSo I want to take you through a kind of whirlwind tour of that
p50
aVand then at the end talk a little bit
p51
aVabout what some of the implications are for us
p52
aVand for our species, as well as our cultures,
p53
aVbecause of this change.
p54
aVNow we actually have been doing it for a long time.
p55
aVWe started selectively breeding animals
p56
aVmany, many thousands of years ago.
p57
aVAnd if you think of dogs for example,
p58
aVdogs are now intentionally-designed creatures.
p59
aVThere isn't a dog on this earth that's a natural creature.
p60
aVDogs are the result
p61
aVof selectively breeding traits that we like.
p62
aVBut we had to do it the hard way in the old days
p63
aVby choosing offspring that looked a particular way
p64
aVand then breeding them.
p65
aVWe don't have to do it that way anymore.
p66
aa(lp67
VThis is a beefalo.
p68
aVA beefalo is a buffalo-cattle hybrid.
p69
aVAnd they are now making them,
p70
aVand someday, perhaps pretty soon,
p71
aVyou will have beefalo patties
p72
aVin your local supermarket.
p73
aVThis is a geep,
p74
aVa goat-sheep hybrid.
p75
aVThe scientists that made this cute little creature
p76
aVended up slaughtering it and eating it afterwards.
p77
aVI think they said it tasted like chicken.
p78
aVThis is a cama.
p79
aVA cama is a camel-llama hybrid,
p80
aVcreated to try to get the hardiness of a camel
p81
aVwith some of the personality traits
p82
aVof a llama.
p83
aVAnd they are now using these in certain cultures.
p84
aVThen there's the liger.
p85
aVThis is the largest cat in the world \u2014
p86
aVthe lion-tiger hybrid.
p87
aVIt's bigger than a tiger.
p88
aVAnd in the case of the liger,
p89
aVthere actually have been one or two that have been seen in the wild.
p90
aVBut these were created by scientists
p91
aVusing both selective breeding and genetic technology.
p92
aVAnd then finally, everybody's favorite,
p93
aVthe zorse.
p94
aVNone of this is Photoshopped. These are real creatures.
p95
aVAnd so one of the things we've been doing
p96
aVis using genetic enhancement,
p97
aVor genetic manipulation,
p98
aVof normal selective breeding
p99
aVpushed a little bit through genetics.
p100
aVAnd if that were all this was about,
p101
aVthen it would be an interesting thing.
p102
aVBut something much, much more powerful
p103
aVis happening now.
p104
aa(lp105
VThese are normal mammalian cells
p106
aVgenetically engineered with a bioluminescent gene
p107
aVtaken out of deep-sea jellyfish.
p108
aVWe all know that some deep-sea creatures glow.
p109
aVWell, they've now taken that gene, that bioluminescent gene,
p110
aVand put it into mammal cells.
p111
aVThese are normal cells.
p112
aVAnd what you see here
p113
aVis these cells glowing in the dark
p114
aVunder certain wavelengths of light.
p115
aVOnce they could do that with cells, they could do it with organisms.
p116
aVSo they did it with mouse pups,
p117
aVkittens.
p118
aVAnd by the way, the reason the kittens here are orange and these are green
p119
aVis because that's a bioluminescent gene from coral,
p120
aVwhile this is from jellyfish.
p121
aVThey did it with pigs.
p122
aVThey did it with puppies.
p123
aVAnd, in fact,
p124
aVthey did it with monkeys.
p125
aVAnd if you can do it with monkeys \u2014
p126
aVthough the great leap in trying to genetically manipulate
p127
aVis actually between monkeys and apes \u2014
p128
aVif they can do it in monkeys,
p129
aVthey can probably figure out how to do it in apes,
p130
aVwhich means they can do it in human beings.
p131
aVIn other words, it is theoretically possible
p132
aVthat before too long we will be biotechnologically capable
p133
aVof creating human beings
p134
aVthat glow in the dark.
p135
aVBe easier to find us at night.
p136
aa(lp137
VAnd in fact, right now in many states,
p138
aVyou can go out and you can buy bioluminescent pets.
p139
aVThese are zebra fish. They're normally black and silver.
p140
aVThese are zebra fish that have been genetically engineered
p141
aVto be yellow, green, red,
p142
aVand they are actually available now in certain states.
p143
aVOther states have banned them.
p144
aVNobody knows what to do with these kinds of creatures.
p145
aVThere is no area of the government \u2014 not the EPA or the FDA \u2014
p146
aVthat controls genetically-engineered pets.
p147
aVAnd so some states have decided to allow them,
p148
aVsome states have decided to ban them.
p149
aa(lp150
VSome of you may have read
p151
aVabout the FDA's consideration right now
p152
aVof genetically-engineered salmon.
p153
aVThe salmon on top
p154
aVis a genetically engineered Chinook salmon,
p155
aVusing a gene from these salmon
p156
aVand from one other fish that we eat,
p157
aVto make it grow much faster
p158
aVusing a lot less feed.
p159
aVAnd right now the FDA is trying to make a final decision
p160
aVon whether, pretty soon, you could be eating this fish \u2014
p161
aVit'll be sold in the stores.
p162
aVAnd before you get too worried about it,
p163
aVhere in the United States,
p164
aVthe majority of food you buy in the supermarket
p165
aValready has genetically-modified components to it.
p166
aVSo even as we worry about it,
p167
aVwe have allowed it to go on in this country \u2014 much different in Europe \u2014
p168
aVwithout any regulation,
p169
aVand even without any identification on the package.
p170
aa(lp171
VThese are all the first cloned animals
p172
aVof their type.
p173
aVSo in the lower right here,
p174
aVyou have Dolly, the first cloned sheep \u2014
p175
aVnow happily stuffed in a museum in Edinburgh;
p176
aVRalph the rat, the first cloned rat;
p177
aVCC the cat, for cloned cat;
p178
aVSnuppy, the first cloned dog \u2014
p179
aVSnuppy for Seoul National University puppy \u2014
p180
aVcreated in South Korea
p181
aVby the very same man that some of you may remember
p182
aVhad to end up resigning in disgrace
p183
aVbecause he claimed he had cloned a human embryo, which he had not.
p184
aVHe actually was the first person
p185
aVto clone a dog, which is a very difficult thing to do,
p186
aVbecause dog genomes are very plastic.
p187
aVThis is Prometea, the first cloned horse.
p188
aVIt's a Haflinger horse cloned in Italy,
p189
aVa real "gold ring" of cloning,
p190
aVbecause there are many horses that win important races
p191
aVwho are geldings.
p192
aVIn other words, the equipment to put them out to stud
p193
aVhas been removed.
p194
aVBut if you can clone that horse,
p195
aVyou can have both the advantage of having a gelding run in the race
p196
aVand his identical genetic duplicate
p197
aVcan then be put out to stud.
p198
aVThese were the first cloned calves,
p199
aVthe first cloned grey wolves,
p200
aVand then, finally,
p201
aVthe first cloned piglets:
p202
aVAlexis, Chista, Carrel, Janie and Dotcom.
p203
aa(lp204
V(Laughter)
p205
aa(lp206
VIn addition, we've started to use cloning technology
p207
aVto try to save endangered species.
p208
aVThis is the use of animals now
p209
aVto create drugs and other things in their bodies
p210
aVthat we want to create.
p211
aVSo with antithrombin in that goat \u2014
p212
aVthat goat has been genetically modified
p213
aVso that the molecules of its milk
p214
aVactually include the molecule of antithrombin
p215
aVthat GTC Genetics wants to create.
p216
aVAnd then in addition, transgenic pigs, knockout pigs,
p217
aVfrom the National Institute of Animal Science in South Korea,
p218
aVare pigs that they are going to use, in fact,
p219
aVto try to create all kinds of drugs
p220
aVand other industrial types of chemicals
p221
aVthat they want the blood and the milk
p222
aVof these animals
p223
aVto produce for them,
p224
aVinstead of producing them in an industrial way.
p225
aa(lp226
VThese are two creatures
p227
aVthat were created
p228
aVin order to save endangered species.
p229
aVThe guar
p230
aVis an endangered Southeast Asian ungulate.
p231
aVA somatic cell, a body cell,
p232
aVwas taken from its body,
p233
aVgestated in the ovum of a cow,
p234
aVand then that cow gave birth to a guar.
p235
aVSame thing happened with the mouflon,
p236
aVwhere it's an endangered species of sheep.
p237
aVIt was gestated in a regular sheep body,
p238
aVwhich actually raises an interesting biological problem.
p239
aVWe have two kinds of DNA in our bodies.
p240
aVWe have our nucleic DNA
p241
aVthat everybody thinks of as our DNA,
p242
aVbut we also have DNA in our mitochondria,
p243
aVwhich are the energy packets of the cell.
p244
aVThat DNA is passed down through our mothers.
p245
aVSo really, what you end up having here
p246
aVis not a guar and not a mouflon,
p247
aVbut a guar
p248
aVwith cow mitochondria,
p249
aVand therefore cow mitochondrial DNA,
p250
aVand a mouflon with another species of sheep's
p251
aVmitochondrial DNA.
p252
aVThese are really hybrids, not pure animals.
p253
aVAnd it raises the question of how we're going to define animal species
p254
aVin the age of biotechnology \u2014
p255
aVa question that we're not really sure yet
p256
aVhow to solve.
p257
aa(lp258
VThis lovely creature
p259
aVis an Asian cockroach.
p260
aVAnd what they've done here
p261
aVis they've put electrodes in its ganglia and its brain
p262
aVand then a transmitter on top,
p263
aVand it's on a big computer tracking ball.
p264
aVAnd now, using a joystick,
p265
aVthey can send this creature
p266
aVaround the lab
p267
aVand control whether it goes left or right,
p268
aVforwards or backwards.
p269
aVThey've created a kind of insect bot,
p270
aVor bugbot.
p271
aVIt gets worse than that \u2014 or perhaps better than that.
p272
aVThis actually is one of DARPA's very important \u2014
p273
aVDARPA is the Defense Research Agency \u2014
p274
aVone of their projects.
p275
aVThese goliath beetles
p276
aVare wired in their wings.
p277
aVThey have a computer chip strapped to their backs,
p278
aVand they can fly these creatures around the lab.
p279
aVThey can make them go left, right. They can make them take off.
p280
aVThey can't actually make them land.
p281
aVThey put them about one inch above the ground,
p282
aVand then they shut everything off and they go pfft.
p283
aVBut it's the closest they can get to a landing.
p284
aa(lp285
VAnd in fact, this technology has gotten so developed
p286
aVthat this creature \u2014
p287
aVthis is a moth \u2014
p288
aVthis is the moth in its pupa stage,
p289
aVand that's when they put the wires in
p290
aVand they put in the computer technology,
p291
aVso that when the moth actually emerges as a moth,
p292
aVit is already prewired.
p293
aVThe wires are already in its body,
p294
aVand they can just hook it up to their technology,
p295
aVand now they've got these bugbots
p296
aVthat they can send out for surveillance.
p297
aVThey can put little cameras on them
p298
aVand perhaps someday deliver
p299
aVother kinds of ordinance
p300
aVto warzones.
p301
aa(lp302
VIt's not just insects.
p303
aVThis is the ratbot, or the robo-rat
p304
aVby Sanjiv Talwar at SUNY Downstate.
p305
aVAgain, it's got technology \u2014
p306
aVit's got electrodes going into its left and right hemispheres;
p307
aVit's got a camera on top of its head.
p308
aVThe scientists can make this creature
p309
aVgo left, right.
p310
aVThey have it running through mazes, controlling where it's going.
p311
aVThey've now created an organic robot.
p312
aVThe graduate students
p313
aVin Sanjiv Talwar's lab
p314
aVsaid, "Is this ethical?
p315
aVWe've taken away the autonomy of this animal."
p316
aVI'll get back to that in a minute.
p317
aa(lp318
VThere's also been work done with monkeys.
p319
aVThis is Miguel Nicolelis of Duke.
p320
aVHe took owl monkeys,
p321
aVwired them up
p322
aVso that a computer watched their brains while they moved,
p323
aVespecially looking at the movement of their right arm.
p324
aVThe computer learned what the monkey brain did
p325
aVto move its arm in various ways.
p326
aVThey then hooked it up to a prosthetic arm,
p327
aVwhich you see here in the picture,
p328
aVput the arm in another room.
p329
aVPretty soon, the computer learned, by reading the monkey's brainwaves,
p330
aVto make that arm in the other room
p331
aVdo whatever the monkey's arm did.
p332
aVThen he put a video monitor
p333
aVin the monkey's cage
p334
aVthat showed the monkey this prosthetic arm,
p335
aVand the monkey got fascinated.
p336
aVThe monkey recognized that whatever she did with her arm,
p337
aVthis prosthetic arm would do.
p338
aVAnd eventually she was moving it and moving it,
p339
aVand eventually stopped moving her right arm
p340
aVand, staring at the screen,
p341
aVcould move the prosthetic arm in the other room
p342
aVonly with her brainwaves \u2014
p343
aVwhich means that monkey
p344
aVbecame the first primate in the history of the world
p345
aVto have three independent functional arms.
p346
aa(lp347
VAnd it's not just technology
p348
aVthat we're putting into animals.
p349
aVThis is Thomas DeMarse at the University of Florida.
p350
aVHe took 20,000 and then 60,000
p351
aVdisaggregated rat neurons \u2014
p352
aVso these are just individual neurons from rats \u2014
p353
aVput them on a chip.
p354
aVThey self-aggregated into a network,
p355
aVbecame an integrated chip.
p356
aVAnd he used that
p357
aVas the IT piece
p358
aVof a mechanism which ran a flight simulator.
p359
aVSo now we have organic computer chips
p360
aVmade out of living, self-aggregating neurons.
p361
aVFinally, Mussa-Ivaldi of Northwestern
p362
aVtook a completely intact,
p363
aVindependent lamprey eel brain.
p364
aVThis is a brain from a lamprey eel.
p365
aVIt is living \u2014
p366
aVfully-intact brain in a nutrient medium
p367
aVwith these electrodes going off to the sides,
p368
aVattached photosensitive sensors to the brain,
p369
aVput it into a cart \u2014
p370
aVhere's the cart, the brain is sitting there in the middle \u2014
p371
aVand using this brain as the sole processor for this cart,
p372
aVwhen you turn on a light and shine it at the cart,
p373
aVthe cart moves toward the light;
p374
aVwhen you turn it off, it moves away.
p375
aVIt's photophilic.
p376
aVSo now we have a complete
p377
aVliving lamprey eel brain.
p378
aVIs it thinking lamprey eel thoughts,
p379
aVsitting there in its nutrient medium?
p380
aVI don't know,
p381
aVbut in fact it is a fully living brain
p382
aVthat we have managed to keep alive
p383
aVto do our bidding.
p384
aa(lp385
VSo, we are now at the stage
p386
aVwhere we are creating creatures
p387
aVfor our own purposes.
p388
aVThis is a mouse created by Charles Vacanti
p389
aVof the University of Massachusetts.
p390
aVHe altered this mouse
p391
aVso that it was genetically engineered
p392
aVto have skin that was less immunoreactive to human skin,
p393
aVput a polymer scaffolding of an ear under it
p394
aVand created an ear that could then be taken off the mouse
p395
aVand transplanted onto a human being.
p396
aVGenetic engineering
p397
aVcoupled with polymer physiotechnology
p398
aVcoupled with xenotransplantation.
p399
aVThis is where we are in this process.
p400
aa(lp401
VFinally, not that long ago,
p402
aVCraig Venter created the first artificial cell,
p403
aVwhere he took a cell, took a DNA synthesizer,
p404
aVwhich is a machine,
p405
aVcreated an artificial genome,
p406
aVput it in a different cell \u2014
p407
aVthe genome was not of the cell he put it in \u2014
p408
aVand that cell then reproduced
p409
aVas the other cell.
p410
aVIn other words,
p411
aVthat was the first creature in the history of the world
p412
aVthat had a computer as its parent \u2014
p413
aVit did not have an organic parent.
p414
aVAnd so, asks The Economist:
p415
aV"The first artificial organism and its consequences."
p416
aa(lp417
VSo you may have thought
p418
aVthat the creation of life
p419
aVwas going to happen in something that looked like that.
p420
aV(Laughter)
p421
aVBut in fact, that's not what Frankenstein's lab looks like.
p422
aVThis is what Frankenstein's lab looks like.
p423
aVThis is a DNA synthesizer,
p424
aVand here at the bottom
p425
aVare just bottles of A, T, C and G \u2014
p426
aVthe four chemicals
p427
aVthat make up our DNA chain.
p428
aa(lp429
VAnd so, we need to ask ourselves some questions.
p430
aVFor the first time in the history of this planet,
p431
aVwe are able to directly design organisms.
p432
aVWe can manipulate the plasmas of life
p433
aVwith unprecedented power,
p434
aVand it confers on us a responsibility.
p435
aVIs everything okay?
p436
aVIs it okay to manipulate and create
p437
aVwhatever creatures we want?
p438
aVDo we have free reign
p439
aVto design animals?
p440
aVDo we get to go someday to Pets 'R' Us
p441
aVand say, "Look, I want a dog.
p442
aVI'd like it to have the head of a Dachshund,
p443
aVthe body of a retriever,
p444
aVmaybe some pink fur,
p445
aVand let's make it glow in the dark"?
p446
aVDoes industry get to create creatures
p447
aVwho, in their milk, in their blood, and in their saliva
p448
aVand other bodily fluids,
p449
aVcreate the drugs and industrial molecules we want
p450
aVand then warehouse them
p451
aVas organic manufacturing machines?
p452
aVDo we get to create organic robots,
p453
aVwhere we remove the autonomy from these animals
p454
aVand turn them just into our playthings?
p455
aa(lp456
VAnd then the final step of this,
p457
aVonce we perfect these technologies in animals
p458
aVand we start using them in human beings,
p459
aVwhat are the ethical guidelines
p460
aVthat we will use then?
p461
aVIt's already happening. It's not science fiction.
p462
aVWe are not only already using these things in animals,
p463
aVsome of them we're already beginning to use
p464
aVon our own bodies.
p465
aa(lp466
VWe are now taking control of our own evolution.
p467
aVWe are directly designing
p468
aVthe future of the species of this planet.
p469
aVIt confers upon us an enormous responsibility
p470
aVthat is not just the responsibility
p471
aVof the scientists and the ethicists
