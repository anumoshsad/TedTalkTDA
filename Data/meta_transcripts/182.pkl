VWhat I am always thinking about
p4
aVis what this session is about, which is called simplicity.
p5
aVAnd almost, I would almost call it being simple-minded,
p6
aVbut in the best sense of the word.
p7
aVI'm trying to figure out two very simple things:
p8
aVhow to live and how to die, period.
p9
aVThat's all I'm trying to do, all day long.
p10
aVAnd I'm also trying to have some meals, and have some snacks,
p11
aVand, you know, and yell at my children, and do all the normal things
p12
aVthat keep you grounded.
p13
aa(lp14
VSo, I was fortunate enough to be born a very dreamy child.
p15
aVMy older sister was busy torturing my parents,
p16
aVand they were busy torturing her.
p17
aVI was lucky enough to be completely ignored,
p18
aVwhich is a fabulous thing, actually, I want to tell you.
p19
aVSo, I was able to completely daydream my way through my life.
p20
aVAnd I finally daydreamed my way into NYU, at a very good time, in 1967,
p21
aVwhere I met a man who was trying to blow up the math building of NYU.
p22
aVAnd I was writing terrible poetry and knitting sweaters for him.
p23
aVAnd feminists hated us, and the whole thing was wretched
p24
aVfrom beginning to end.
p25
aVBut I kept writing bad poetry, and he didn't blow up the math building,
p26
aVbut he went to Cuba.
p27
aVBut I gave him the money, because I was from Riverdale
p28
aVso I had more money than he did.
p29
aV(Laughter)
p30
aVAnd that was a good thing to help, you know, the cause.
p31
aVBut, then he came back, and things happened,
p32
aVand I decided I really hated my writing,
p33
aVthat it was awful, awful, purple prose.
p34
aVAnd I decided that I wanted to tell \u2014
p35
aVbut I still wanted to tell a narrative story
p36
aVand I still wanted to tell my stories.
p37
aVSo I decided that I would start to draw. How hard could that be?
p38
aVAnd so what happened was that I started
p39
aVjust becoming an editorial illustrator through, you know,
p40
aVsheer whatever, sheer ignorance.
p41
aa(lp42
VAnd we started a studio.
p43
aVWell, Tibor really started the studio, called M&Co.
p44
aVAnd the premise of M&Co was, we don't know anything,
p45
aVbut that's all right, we're going to do it anyway.
p46
aVAnd as a matter of fact, it's better not to know anything,
p47
aVbecause if you know too much, you're stymied.
p48
aVSo, the premise in the studio was,
p49
aVthere are no boundaries, there is no fear.
p50
aVAnd I \u2014 and my full-time job, I landed the best job on Earth,
p51
aVwas to daydream, and to actually come up with absurd ideas
p52
aVthat \u2014 fortunately, there were enough people there,
p53
aVand it was a team, it was a collective,
p54
aVit was not just me coming up with crazy ideas.
p55
aVBut the point was that I was there as myself, as a dreamer.
p56
aVAnd so some of the things \u2014 I mean, it was a long history of M&Co,
p57
aVand clearly we also needed to make some money,
p58
aVso we decided we would create a series of products.
p59
aVAnd some of the watches there,
p60
aVattempting to be beautiful and humorous \u2014
p61
aVmaybe not attempting, hopefully succeeding.
p62
aVThat to be able to talk about content,
p63
aVto break apart what you normally expect, to use humor and surprise,
p64
aVelegance and humanity in your work was really important to us.
p65
aVIt was a very high, it was a very impersonal time in design
p66
aVand we wanted to say, the content is what's important,
p67
aVnot the package, not the wrapping.
p68
aVYou really have to be journalists, you have to be inventors,
p69
aVyou have to use your imagination more importantly than anything.
p70
aa(lp71
VSo, the good news is that I have a dog
p72
aVand, though I don't know if I believe in luck \u2014
p73
aVI don't know what I believe in, it's a very complicated question,
p74
aVbut I do know that before I go away, I crank his tail seven times.
p75
aVSo, whenever he sees a suitcase in the house,
p76
aVbecause everybody's always, you know, leaving,
p77
aVthey're always cranking this wonderful dog's tail,
p78
aVand he runs to the other room.
p79
aVBut I am able to make the transition from working for children and \u2014
p80
aVfrom working for adults to children, and back and forth,
p81
aVbecause, you know, I can say that I'm immature,
p82
aVand in a way, that's true.
p83
aVI don't really \u2014 I mean, I could tell you that I didn't understand,
p84
aVI'm not proud of it, but I didn't understand
p85
aVlet's say 95 percent of the talks at this conference.
p86
aVBut I have been taking beautiful notes of drawings
p87
aVand I have a gorgeous onion from Murray Gell-Mann's talk.
p88
aVAnd I have a beautiful page of doodles from Jonathan Woodham's talk.
p89
aVSo, good things come out of, you know, incomprehension \u2014
p90
aV(Laughter)
p91
aV\u2014 which I will do a painting of, and then it will end up in my work.
p92
aVSo, I'm open to the possibilities of not knowing
p93
aVand finding out something new.
p94
aa(lp95
VSo, in writing for children, it seems simple, and it is.
p96
aVYou have to condense a story into 32 pages, usually.
p97
aVAnd what you have to do is, you really have to edit down to what you want to say.
p98
aVAnd hopefully, you're not talking down to kids
p99
aVand you're not talking in such a way that you,
p100
aVyou know, couldn't stand reading it after one time.
p101
aVSo, I hopefully am writing, you know,
p102
aVbooks that are good for children and for adults.
p103
aVBut the painting reflects \u2014
p104
aVI don't think differently for children than I do for adults.
p105
aVI try to use the same kind of imagination, the same kind of whimsy,
p106
aVthe same kind of love of language.
p107
aVSo, you know, and I have lots of wonderful-looking friends.
p108
aa(lp109
VThis is Andrew Gatz, and he walked in through the door and I said,
p110
aV"You! Sit down there." You know, I take lots of photos.
p111
aVAnd the Bertoia chair in the background is my favorite chair.
p112
aVSo, I get to put in all of the things that I love.
p113
aVHopefully, a dialog between adults and children will happen on many different levels,
p114
aVand hopefully different kinds of humor will evolve.
p115
aVAnd the books are really journals of my life.
p116
aVI never \u2014 I don't like plots.
p117
aVI don't know what a plot means.
p118
aVI can't stand the idea of anything that starts in the beginning,
p119
aVyou know, beginning, middle and end. It really scares me,
p120
aVbecause my life is too random and too confused,
p121
aVand I enjoy it that way.
p122
aa(lp123
VBut anyway, so we were in Venice,
p124
aVand this is our room. And I had this dream
p125
aVthat I was wearing this fantastic green gown,
p126
aVand I was looking out the window,
p127
aVand it was really a beautiful thing.
p128
aVAnd so, I was able to put that into this story, which is an alphabet,
p129
aVand hopefully go on to something else.
p130
aVThe letter C had other things in it.
p131
aVI was fortunate also, to meet the man who's sitting on the bed,
p132
aVthough I gave him hair over here and he doesn't have hair.
p133
aVWell, he has some hair but \u2014 well, he used to have hair.
p134
aVAnd with him, I was able to do a project that was really fantastic.
p135
aVI work for the New Yorker, and I do covers, and 9/11 happened
p136
aVand it was, you know, a complete and utter end of the world as we knew it.
p137
aa(lp138
VAnd Rick and I were on our way to a party in the Bronx,
p139
aVand somebody said Bronxistan,
p140
aVand somebody said Ferreristan,
p141
aVand we came up with this New Yorker cover,
p142
aVwhich we were able to \u2014 we didn't know what we were doing.
p143
aVWe weren't trying to be funny, we weren't trying to be \u2014
p144
aVwell, we were trying to be funny actually, that's not true.
p145
aVWe hoped we'd be funny, but we didn't know it would be a cover,
p146
aVand we didn't know that that image, at the moment that it happened,
p147
aVwould be something that would be so wonderful for a lot of people.
p148
aVAnd it really became the \u2014 I don't know, you know,
p149
aVit was one of those moments people started laughing at what was going on.
p150
aVAnd from, you know, Fattushis, to Taxistan to, you know,
p151
aVfor the Fashtoonks, Botoxia, Pashmina, Khlintunisia, you know,
p152
aVwe were able to take the city
p153
aVand make fun of this completely foreign, who are \u2014 what's going on over here?
p154
aVWho are these people? What are these tribes?
p155
aVAnd David Remnick, who was really wonderful about it,
p156
aVhad one problem. He didn't like Al Zheimers,
p157
aVbecause he thought it would insult people with Alzheimer's.
p158
aVBut you know, we said, "David, who's going to know?
p159
aVThey're not."
p160
aV(Laughter)
p161
aVSo it stayed in, and it was, and, you know, it was a good thing.
p162
aVYou know, in the course of my life, I never know what's going to happen
p163
aVand that's kind of the beauty part.
p164
aa(lp165
VAnd we were on Cape Cod, a place, obviously, of great inspiration,
p166
aVand I picked up this book, "The Elements of Style," at a yard sale.
p167
aVAnd I didn't \u2014 and I'd never used it in school,
p168
aVbecause I was too busy writing poems, and flunking out,
p169
aVand I don't know what, sitting in cafes.
p170
aVBut I picked it up and I started reading it and I thought, this book is amazing.
p171
aVI said, people should know about this book.
p172
aV(Laughter)
p173
aVSo I decided it needed a few \u2014 it needed a lift, it needed a few illustrations.
p174
aVAnd basically, I called the, you know, I convinced the White Estate,
p175
aVand what an intersection of like, you know,
p176
aVPolish Jew, you know, main WASP family. Here I am, saying,
p177
aVI'd like to do something to this book.
p178
aVAnd they said yes, and they left me completely alone,
p179
aVwhich was a gorgeous, wonderful thing.
p180
aVAnd I took the examples that they gave,
p181
aVand just did 56 paintings, basically.
p182
aVSo, this is, I don't know if you can read this.
p183
aV"Well, Susan, this is a fine mess you are in."
p184
aVAnd when you're dealing with grammar,
p185
aVwhich is, you know, incredibly dry,
p186
aVE.B. White wrote such wonderful, whimsical \u2014 and actually, Strunk \u2014
p187
aVand then you come to the rules and, you know,
p188
aVthere are lots of grammar things. "Do you mind me asking a question?
p189
aVDo you mind my asking a question?"
p190
aV"Would, could, should, or would, should, could."
p191
aVAnd "would" is Coco Chanel's lover, "should" is Edith Sitwell,
p192
aVand "could" is an August Sander subject.
p193
aVAnd, "He noticed a large stain in the center of the rug."
p194
aV(Laughter)
p195
aa(lp196
VSo, there's a kind of British understatement, murder-mystery theme
p197
aVthat I really love very much.
p198
aVAnd then, "Be obscure clearly! Be wild of tongue in a way we can understand."
p199
aVE.B. White wrote us a number of rules,
p200
aVwhich can either paralyze you and make you loathe him
p201
aVfor the rest of time, or you can ignore them, which I do,
p202
aVor you can, I don't know what, you know, eat a sandwich.
p203
aVSo, what I did when I was painting was I started singing,
p204
aVbecause I really adore singing,
p205
aVand I think that music is the highest form of all art.
p206
aVSo, I commissioned a wonderful composer, Nico Muhly,
p207
aVwho wrote nine songs using the text,
p208
aVand we performed this fantastic evening of \u2014
p209
aVhe wrote music for both amateurs and professionals.
p210
aVI played the clattering teacup and the slinky
p211
aVin the main reading room of the New York Public Library,
p212
aVwhere you're supposed to be very, very quiet,
p213
aVand it was a phenomenally wonderful event,
p214
aVwhich we hopefully will do some more.
p215
aa(lp216
VWho knows? The New York TimesSelect, the op-ed page,
p217
aVasked me to do a column, and they said, you can do whatever you want.
p218
aVSo, once a month for the last year,
p219
aVI've been doing a column called "The Principles of Uncertainty,"
p220
aVwhich, you know, I don't know who Heisenberg is,
p221
aVbut I know I can throw that around now. You know,
p222
aVit's the principles of uncertainty, so, you know.
p223
aVI'm going to read quickly \u2014 and probably I'm going to edit some,
p224
aVbecause I don't have that much time left \u2014 a few of the columns.
p225
aVAnd basically, I was so, you know, it was so amusing,
p226
aVbecause I said, "Well, how much space do I have?"
p227
aVAnd they said, "Well, you know, it's the Internet."
p228
aVAnd I said, "Yes, but how much space do I have?"
p229
aVAnd they said, "It's unlimited, it's unlimited."
p230
aVOK. So, the first one I was very timid, and I'll begin.
p231
aV"How can I tell you everything that is in my heart?
p232
aVImpossible to begin. Enough. No. Begin with the hapless dodo."
p233
aVAnd I talk about the dodo, and how the dodo became extinct,
p234
aVand then I talk about Spinoza.
p235
aV"As the last dodo was dying, Spinoza was looking for a rational explanation
p236
aVfor everything, called eudaemonia.
p237
aVAnd then he breathed his last, with loved ones around him,
p238
aVand I know that he had chicken soup also, as his last meal."
p239
aVI happen to know it for a fact.
p240
aVAnd then he died, and there was no more Spinoza. Extinct.
p241
aa(lp242
VAnd then, we don't have a stuffed Spinoza,
p243
aVbut we do have a stuffed Pavlov's dog,
p244
aVand I visited him in the Museum of Hygiene in St. Petersburg, in Russia.
p245
aVAnd there he is, with this horrible electrical box on his rump
p246
aVin this fantastic, decrepit palace.
p247
aV"And I think it must have been a very, very dark day
p248
aVwhen the Bolsheviks arrived.
p249
aVMaybe amongst themselves they had a few good laughs,
p250
aVbut Stalin was a paranoid man, even more than my father."
p251
aV(Laughter)
p252
aVYou don't even know.
p253
aV"And decided his top people had to be extinctified."
p254
aVWhich I think I made up, which is a good thing.
p255
aVAnd so, this is a chart of, you know, just a small chart,
p256
aVbecause the chart would go on forever of all the people that he killed.
p257
aVSo, shot dead, smacked over the head, you know, thrown away.
p258
aV"Nabokov's family fled Russia. How could the young Nabokov,
p259
aVsitting innocently and elegantly in a red chair,
p260
aVleafing through a book and butterflies,
p261
aVimagine such displacement, such loss?"
p262
aVAnd then I want to tell you that this is a map.
p263
aa(lp264
VSo, "My beautiful mother's family fled Russia as well.
p265
aVToo many pogroms.
p266
aVLeaving the shack, the wild blueberry woods, the geese, the River Sluch,
p267
aVthey went to Palestine and then America."
p268
aVAnd my mother drew this map for me of the United States of America,
p269
aVand that is my DNA over here, because that person who I grew up with
p270
aVhad no use for facts whatsoever.
p271
aVFacts were actually banished from our home.
p272
aVAnd so, if you see that Texas \u2014 you know, Texas and California
p273
aVare under Canada, and that South Carolina is on top of North Carolina,
p274
aVthis is the home that I grew up in, OK?
p275
aVSo, it's a miracle that I'm here today.
p276
aVBut actually, it's not. It's actually a wonderful thing.
p277
aVBut then she says Tel Aviv and Lenin,
p278
aVwhich is the town they came from, and, "Sorry, the rest unknown, thank you."
p279
aVBut in her lexicon, "sorry, the rest unknown, thank you" is
p280
aV"sorry, the rest unknown, go to hell,"
p281
aVbecause she couldn't care less.
p282
aV(Laughter)
p283
aa(lp284
V"The Impossibility of February"
p285
aVis that February's a really wretched month in New York
p286
aVand the images for me conjure up these really awful things.
p287
aVWell, not so awful.
p288
aVI received a box in the mail and it was wrapped with newspaper
p289
aVand there was the picture of the man on the newspaper and he was dead.
p290
aVAnd I say, "I hope he's not really dead,
p291
aVjust enjoying a refreshing lie-down in the snow,
p292
aVbut the caption says he is dead."
p293
aVAnd actually, he was. I think he's dead, though I don't know,
p294
aVmaybe he's not dead.
p295
aV"And this woman leans over in anguish, not about that man,
p296
aVbut about all sad things. It happens quite often in February."
p297
aVThere's consoling.
p298
aVThis man is angry because somebody threw onions all over the staircase,
p299
aVand basically \u2014 you know, I guess onions are a theme here.
p300
aVAnd he says, "It is impossible not to lie.
p301
aVIt is February and not lying is impossible."
p302
aVAnd I really spend a lot of time wondering,
p303
aVhow much truth do we tell?
p304
aVWhat is it that we're actually \u2014 what story are we actually telling?
p305
aVHow do we know when we are ourselves?
p306
aVHow do we actually know that these sentences coming out of our mouths
p307
aVare real stories, you know, are real sentences?
p308
aVOr are they fake sentences that we think we ought to be saying?
p309
aa(lp310
VI'm going to quickly go through this.
p311
aVA quote by Bertrand Russell,
p312
aV"All the labor of all the ages, all the devotion, all the inspiration,
p313
aVall the noonday brightness of human genius
p314
aVare destined to extinction.
p315
aVSo now, my friends, if that is true,
p316
aVand it is true, what is the point?"
p317
aVA complicated question.
p318
aVAnd so, you know, I talk to my friends
p319
aVand I go to plays where they're singing Russian songs.
p320
aVOh my God, you know what?
p321
aVCould we have \u2014 no, we don't have time.
p322
aVI taped my aunt. I taped my aunt singing a song in Russian from the \u2014
p323
aVyou know, could we have it for a second?
p324
aVDo you have that?
p325
aV(Music)
p326
aVOK. I taped my \u2014 my aunt used to swim in the ocean
p327
aVevery day of the year until she was about 85.
p328
aVSo \u2014 and that's a song about how everybody's miserable
p329
aVbecause, you know, we're from Russia.
p330
aV(Laughter)
p331
aa(lp332
VI went to visit Kitty Carlisle Hart, and she is 96,
p333
aVand when I brought her a copy of "The Elements of Style,"
p334
aVshe said she would treasure it.
p335
aVAnd then I said \u2014 oh, and she was talking about Moss Hart, and I said,
p336
aV"When you met him, you knew it was him."
p337
aVAnd she said, "I knew it was he."
p338
aV(Laughter)
p339
aVSo, I was the one who should have kept the book, but it was a really wonderful moment.
p340
aVAnd she dated George Gershwin, so, you know, get out.
p341
aVGershwin died at the age of 38.
p342
aVHe's buried in the same cemetery as my husband.
p343
aVI don't want to talk about that now.
p344
aVI do want to talk \u2014 the absolute icing on this cemetery cake
p345
aVis the Barricini family mausoleum nearby.
p346
aVI think the Barricini family should open a store there and sell chocolate.
p347
aV(Laughter)
p348
aVAnd I would like to run it for them.
p349
aVAnd I went to visit Louise Bourgeoise,
p350
aVwho's also still working, and I looked at her sink,
p351
aVwhich is really amazing, and left.
p352
aVAnd then I photograph and do a painting of a sofa on the street.
p353
aVAnd a woman who lives on our street, Lolita.
p354
aVAnd then I go and have some tea.
p355
aVAnd then my Aunt Frances dies, and before she died,
p356
aVshe tried to pay with Sweet'N Low packets for her bagel.
p357
aV(Laughter)
p358
aVAnd I wonder what the point is and then I know, and I see
p359
aVthat Hy Meyerowitz, Rick Meyerowitz's father,
p360
aVa dry-cleaning supply salesman from the Bronx,
p361
aVwon the Charlie Chaplin look-alike contest in 1931.
p362
aVThat's actually Hy.
p363
aVAnd I look at a beautiful bowl of fruit,
p364
aVand I look at a dress that I sewed for friends of mine.
p365
aVAnd it says, "Ich habe genug," which is a Bach cantata,
p366
aVwhich I once thought meant "I've had it, I can't take it anymore,
p367
aVgive me a break," but I was wrong.
p368
aVIt means "I have enough." And that is utterly true.
p369
aVI happen to be alive, end of discussion. Thank you.
