VToday I have just one request.
p4
aVPlease don't tell me I'm normal.
p5
aa(lp6
VNow I'd like to introduce you to my brothers.
p7
aVRemi is 22,
p8
aVtall and very handsome.
p9
aVHe's speechless, but he communicates joy
p10
aVin a way that some of the best orators cannot.
p11
aVRemi knows what love is.
p12
aVHe shares it unconditionally and he shares it regardless.
p13
aVHe's not greedy. He doesn't see skin color.
p14
aVHe doesn't care about religious differences, and get this:
p15
aVHe has never told a lie.
p16
aVWhen he sings songs from our childhood,
p17
aVattempting words that not even I could remember,
p18
aVhe reminds me of one thing:
p19
aVhow little we know about the mind, and how wonderful
p20
aVthe unknown must be.
p21
aa(lp22
VSamuel is 16. He's tall. He's very handsome.
p23
aVHe has the most impeccable memory.
p24
aVHe has a selective one, though.
p25
aVHe doesn't remember if he stole my chocolate bar,
p26
aVbut he remembers the year of release for every song on my iPod,
p27
aVconversations we had when he was four,
p28
aVweeing on my arm on the first ever episode of Teletubbies,
p29
aVand Lady Gaga's birthday.
p30
aa(lp31
VDon't they sound incredible?
p32
aVBut most people don't agree.
p33
aVAnd in fact, because their minds don't fit
p34
aVinto society's version of normal,
p35
aVthey're often bypassed and misunderstood.
p36
aa(lp37
VBut what lifted my heart and strengthened my soul
p38
aVwas that even though this was the case,
p39
aValthough they were not seen as ordinary,
p40
aVthis could only mean one thing:
p41
aVthat they were extraordinary \u2014
p42
aVautistic and extraordinary.
p43
aa(lp44
VNow, for you who may be less familiar with the term "autism,"
p45
aVit's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication,
p46
aVlearning and sometimes physical skills.
p47
aVIt manifests in each individual differently,
p48
aVhence why Remi is so different from Sam.
p49
aVAnd across the world, every 20 minutes, one new person
p50
aVis diagnosed with autism, and although it's one of
p51
aVthe fastest-growing developmental disorders in the world,
p52
aVthere is no known cause or cure.
p53
aa(lp54
VAnd I cannot remember the first moment I encountered autism,
p55
aVbut I cannot recall a day without it.
p56
aVI was just three years old when my brother came along,
p57
aVand I was so excited that
p58
aVI had a new being in my life.
p59
aVAnd after a few months went by,
p60
aVI realized that he was different.
p61
aVHe screamed a lot.
p62
aVHe didn't want to play like the other babies did,
p63
aVand in fact, he didn't seem
p64
aVvery interested in me whatsoever.
p65
aVRemi lived and reigned in his own world, with his own rules,
p66
aVand he found pleasure in the smallest things,
p67
aVlike lining up cars around the room
p68
aVand staring at the washing machine
p69
aVand eating anything that came in between.
p70
aVAnd as he grew older, he grew more different,
p71
aVand the differences became more obvious.
p72
aVYet beyond the tantrums and the frustration
p73
aVand the never-ending hyperactivity
p74
aVwas something really unique:
p75
aVa pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world
p76
aVwithout prejudice, a human who had never lied.
p77
aVExtraordinary.
p78
aa(lp79
VNow, I cannot deny that there have been
p80
aVsome challenging moments in my family,
p81
aVmoments where I've wished that they were just like me.
p82
aVBut I cast my mind back to the things that they've taught me
p83
aVabout individuality and communication and love,
p84
aVand I realize that these are things that
p85
aVI wouldn't want to change with normality.
p86
aVNormality overlooks the beauty that differences give us,
p87
aVand the fact that we are different doesn't mean that one of us is wrong.
p88
aVIt just means that there's a different kind of right.
p89
aVAnd if I could communicate just one thing to Remi
p90
aVand to Sam
p91
aVand to you,
p92
aVit would be that you don't have to be normal.
p93
aVYou can be extraordinary.
p94
aVBecause autistic or not,
p95
aVthe differences that we have \u2014
p96
aVWe've got a gift! Everyone's got a gift inside of us,
p97
aVand in all honesty, the pursuit of normality
p98
aVis the ultimate sacrifice of potential.
p99
aVThe chance for greatness, for progress and for change
p100
aVdies the moment we try to be like someone else.
p101
aa(lp102
VPlease \u2014 don't tell me I'm normal.
p103
aVThank you. (Applause)
