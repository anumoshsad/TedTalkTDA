VAs a boy,
p4
aVI loved cars.
p5
aVWhen I turned 18,
p6
aVI lost my best friend to a car accident.
p7
aVLike this.
p8
aVAnd then I decided I'd dedicate my life
p9
aVto saving one million people
p10
aVevery year.
p11
aVNow I haven't succeeded, so this is just a progress report,
p12
aVbut I'm here to tell you a little bit about self-driving cars.
p13
aa(lp14
VI saw the concept first
p15
aVin the DARPA Grand Challenges
p16
aVwhere the U.S. government issued a prize
p17
aVto build a self-driving car that could navigate a desert.
p18
aVAnd even though a hundred teams were there,
p19
aVthese cars went nowhere.
p20
aVSo we decided at Stanford to build a different self-driving car.
p21
aVWe built the hardware and the software.
p22
aVWe made it learn from us,
p23
aVand we set it free in the desert.
p24
aVAnd the unimaginable happened:
p25
aVit became the first car
p26
aVto ever return from a DARPA Grand Challenge,
p27
aVwinning Stanford 2 million dollars.
p28
aVYet I still hadn't saved a single life.
p29
aa(lp30
VSince, our work has focused
p31
aVon building driving cars
p32
aVthat can drive anywhere by themselves \u2014
p33
aVany street in California.
p34
aVWe've driven 140,000 miles.
p35
aVOur cars have sensors
p36
aVby which they magically can see
p37
aVeverything around them
p38
aVand make decisions
p39
aVabout every aspect of driving.
p40
aVIt's the perfect driving mechanism.
p41
aVWe've driven in cities,
p42
aVlike in San Francisco here.
p43
aVWe've driven from San Francisco to Los Angeles on Highway 1.
p44
aa(lp45
VWe've encountered joggers,
p46
aVbusy highways, toll booths,
p47
aVand this is without a person in the loop;
p48
aVthe car just drives itself.
p49
aVIn fact, while we drove 140,000 miles,
p50
aVpeople didn't even notice.
p51
aVMountain roads,
p52
aVday and night,
p53
aVand even crooked Lombard Street
p54
aVin San Francisco.
p55
aV(Laughter)
p56
aVSometimes our cars get so crazy,
p57
aVthey even do little stunts.
p58
aa(lp59
V(Video) Man: Oh, my God.
p60
aVWhat?
p61
aVSecond Man: It's driving itself.
p62
aa(lp63
VSebastian Thrun: Now I can't get my friend Harold back to life,
p64
aVbut I can do something for all the people who died.
p65
aVDo you know that driving accidents
p66
aVare the number one cause of death for young people?
p67
aVAnd do you realize that almost all of those
p68
aVare due to human error
p69
aVand not machine error,
p70
aVand can therefore be prevented by machines?
p71
aa(lp72
VDo you realize
p73
aVthat we could change the capacity of highways
p74
aVby a factor of two or three
p75
aVif we didn't rely on human precision
p76
aVon staying in the lane \u2014
p77
aVimprove body position
p78
aVand therefore drive a little bit closer together
p79
aVon a little bit narrower lanes,
p80
aVand do away with all traffic jams on highways?
p81
aVDo you realize that you, TED users,
p82
aVspend an average
p83
aVof 52 minutes per day
p84
aVin traffic,
p85
aVwasting your time
p86
aVon your daily commute?
p87
aVYou could regain this time.
p88
aVThis is four billion hours
p89
aVwasted in this country alone.
p90
aVAnd it's 2.4 billion gallons of gasoline wasted.
p91
aa(lp92
VNow I think there's a vision here, a new technology,
p93
aVand I'm really looking forward to a time
p94
aVwhen generations after us look back at us
p95
aVand say how ridiculous it was that humans were driving cars.
p96
aa(lp97
VThank you.
