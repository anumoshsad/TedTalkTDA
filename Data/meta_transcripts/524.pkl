VI'm going to read a few strips.
p4
aVThese are, most of these are
p5
aVfrom a monthly page I do
p6
aVin and architecture and design magazine
p7
aVcalled Metropolis.
p8
aa(lp9
VAnd the first story is called
p10
aV"The Faulty Switch."
p11
aa(lp12
VAnother beautifully designed new building
p13
aVruined by the sound of a common wall light switch.
p14
aVIt's fine during the day
p15
aVwhen the main rooms are flooded with sunlight.
p16
aVBut at dusk
p17
aVeverything changes.
p18
aa(lp19
VThe architect spent hundreds of hours
p20
aVdesigning the burnished brass switchplates
p21
aVfor his new office tower.
p22
aVAnd then left it to a contractor
p23
aVto install these 79-cent switches behind them.
p24
aa(lp25
VWe know instinctively where to reach
p26
aVwhen we enter a dark room.
p27
aVWe automatically throw the little nub of plastic upward.
p28
aVBut the sound we are greeted with,
p29
aVas the room is bathed in the simulated glow
p30
aVof late-afternoon light,
p31
aVrecalls to mind
p32
aVa dirty men's room
p33
aVin the rear of a Greek coffee shop.
p34
aV(Laughter)
p35
aa(lp36
VThis sound colors our first impression of any room;
p37
aVit can't be helped.
p38
aVBut where does this sound,
p39
aVcommonly described as a click, come from?
p40
aVIs it simply the byproduct of a
p41
aVcrude mechanical action?
p42
aVOr is it an imitation
p43
aVof one half the set of sounds we make
p44
aVto express disappointment?
p45
aVThe often dental consonant
p46
aVof no Indo-European language.
p47
aa(lp48
VOr is it the amplified sound
p49
aVof a synapse firing
p50
aVin the brain of a cockroach?
p51
aVIn the 1950s they tried their best
p52
aVto muffle this sound
p53
aVwith mercury switches
p54
aVand silent knob controls.
p55
aa(lp56
VBut today these improvements
p57
aVseem somehow inauthentic.
p58
aVThe click is the modern
p59
aVtriumphal clarion
p60
aVproceeding us through life,
p61
aVannouncing our entry into every lightless room.
p62
aa(lp63
VThe sound made flicking a wall switch off
p64
aVis of a completely different nature.
p65
aVIt has a deep melancholy ring.
p66
aVChildren don't like it.
p67
aVIt's why they leave lights on around the house. (Laughter)
p68
aVAdults find it comforting.
p69
aa(lp70
VBut wouldn't it be an easy matter
p71
aVto wire a wall switch
p72
aVso that it triggers the muted horn of a steam ship?
p73
aVOr the recorded crowing of a rooster?
p74
aVOr the distant peel of thunder?
p75
aa(lp76
VThomas Edison went through
p77
aVthousands of unlikely substances
p78
aVbefore he came upon the right one
p79
aVfor the filament of his electric light bulb.
p80
aVWhy have we settled so quickly
p81
aVfor the sound of its switch?
p82
aVThat's the end of that.
p83
aV(Applause)
p84
aa(lp85
VThe next story is called
p86
aV"In Praise of the Taxpayer."
p87
aa(lp88
VThat so many of the city's most venerable taxpayers
p89
aVhave survived yet another commercial building boom,
p90
aVis cause for celebration.
p91
aa(lp92
VThese one or two story structures,
p93
aVdesigned to yield only enough income
p94
aVto cover the taxes on the land
p95
aVon which they stand,
p96
aVwere not meant to be permanent buildings.
p97
aVYet for one reason or another
p98
aVthey have confounded the efforts of developers
p99
aVto be combined into lots
p100
aVsuitable for high-rise construction.
p101
aa(lp102
VAlthough they make no claim to architectural beauty,
p103
aVthey are, in their perfect temporariness,
p104
aVa delightful alternative
p105
aVto the large-scale structures
p106
aVthat might someday take their place.
p107
aVThe most perfect examples
p108
aVoccupy corner lots.
p109
aVThey offer a pleasant respite
p110
aVfrom the high-density development around them.
p111
aVA break of light and air,
p112
aVan architectural biding of time.
p113
aa(lp114
VSo buried in signage
p115
aVare these structures,
p116
aVthat it often takes a moment
p117
aVto distinguish the modern
p118
aVspecially constructed taxpayer
p119
aVfrom its neighbor:
p120
aVthe small commercial building
p121
aVfrom an earlier century,
p122
aVwhose upper floors have been sealed,
p123
aVand whose groundfloor space
p124
aVnow functions as a taxpayer.
p125
aVThe few surfaces not covered by signs
p126
aVare often clad in a distinctive, dark
p127
aVgreen-gray, striated aluminum siding.
p128
aVTake-out sandwich shops,
p129
aVfilm processing drop-offs,
p130
aVpeep-shows and necktie stores.
p131
aa(lp132
VNow these provisional structures have,
p133
aVin some cases,
p134
aVremained standing
p135
aVfor the better part of a human lifetime.
p136
aVThe temporary building
p137
aVis a triumph of modern industrial organization,
p138
aVa healthy sublimation
p139
aVof the urge to build,
p140
aVand proof that not every
p141
aVarchitectural idea
p142
aVneed be set in stone.
p143
aVThat's the end.
p144
aV(Laughter)
p145
aa(lp146
VAnd the next story is called, "On the Human Lap."
p147
aVFor the ancient Egyptians
p148
aVthe lap was a platform
p149
aVupon which to place
p150
aVthe earthly possessions of the dead \u2014
p151
aV30 cubits from foot to knee.
p152
aa(lp153
VIt was not until the 14th century
p154
aVthat an Italian painter
p155
aVrecognized the lap
p156
aVas a Grecian temple,
p157
aVupholstered in flesh and cloth.
p158
aVOver the next 200 years
p159
aVwe see the infant Christ
p160
aVgo from a sitting to a standing position
p161
aVon the Virgin's lap,
p162
aVand then back again.
p163
aVEvery child recapitulates this ascension,
p164
aVstraddling one or both legs,
p165
aVsitting sideways,
p166
aVor leaning against the body.
p167
aa(lp168
VFrom there, to the modern ventriloquist's dummy,
p169
aVis but a brief moment in history.
p170
aVYou were late for school again this morning.
p171
aVThe ventriloquist must first make us believe
p172
aVthat a small boy is sitting on his lap.
p173
aVThe illusion of speech follows incidentally.
p174
aVWhat have you got to say for yourself, Jimmy?
p175
aa(lp176
VAs adults we admire the lap
p177
aVfrom a nostalgic distance.
p178
aVWe have fading memories
p179
aVof that provisional temple,
p180
aVerected each time an adult sat down.
p181
aVOn a crowded bus there was always a lap to sit on.
p182
aVIt is children and teenage girls
p183
aVwho are most keenly aware
p184
aVof its architectural beauty.
p185
aVThey understand the structural integrity
p186
aVof a deep avuncular lap,
p187
aVas compared to the shaky arrangement
p188
aVof a neurotic niece in high heels.
p189
aa(lp190
VThe relationship between the lap and its owner
p191
aVis direct and intimate.
p192
aVI envision a 36-story,
p193
aV450-unit residential high-rise \u2014
p194
aVa reason to consider the mental health
p195
aVof any architect before granting
p196
aVan important commission.
p197
aVThe bathrooms and kitchens will,
p198
aVof course, have no windows.
p199
aVThe lap of luxury
p200
aVis an architectural construct of childhood,
p201
aVwhich we seek, in vain,
p202
aVas adults, to employ.
p203
aVThat's the end.
p204
aV(Laughter)
p205
aa(lp206
VThe next story is called "The Haverpiece Collection"
p207
aVA nondescript warehouse,
p208
aVvisible for a moment
p209
aVfrom the northbound lanes of the Prykushko Expressway,
p210
aVserves as the temporary resting place
p211
aVfor the Haverpiece collection
p212
aVof European dried fruit.
p213
aa(lp214
VThe profound convolutions
p215
aVon the surface of a dried cherry.
p216
aVThe foreboding sheen of an extra-large date.
p217
aa(lp218
VDo you remember wandering as a child
p219
aVthrough those dark wooden
p220
aVstorefront galleries?
p221
aVWhere everything was displayed
p222
aVin poorly labeled roach-proof bins.
p223
aa(lp224
VPears dried in the form
p225
aVof genital organs.
p226
aVApricot halves
p227
aVlike the ears of cherubim.
p228
aa(lp229
VIn 1962 the unsold stock
p230
aVwas purchased by Maurice Haverpiece,
p231
aVa wealthy prune juice bottler,
p232
aVand consolidated to form the core collection.
p233
aVAs an art form it lies somewhere between
p234
aVstill-life painting and plumbing.
p235
aa(lp236
VUpon his death in 1967,
p237
aVa quarter of the items were sold off for compote
p238
aVto a high-class hotel restaurant.
p239
aV(Laughter)
p240
aVUnsuspecting guests were served
p241
aVstewed turn-of-the-century
p242
aVTurkish figs for breakfast.
p243
aV(Laughter)
p244
aa(lp245
VThe rest of the collection remains here,
p246
aVstored in plain brown paper bags
p247
aVuntil funds can be raised
p248
aVto build a permanent museum
p249
aVand study center.
