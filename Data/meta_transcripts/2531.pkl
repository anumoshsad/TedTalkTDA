VWhen we're designing new products,
p4
aVservices or businesses,
p5
aVthe only time you'll know if they're any good,
p6
aVif the designs are good,
p7
aVis to see how they're used in the real world, in context.
p8
aa(lp9
VI'm reminded of that every time I walk past Highbury Fields
p10
aVin north London.
p11
aVIt's absolutely beautiful.
p12
aVThere's a big open green space.
p13
aVThere's Georgian buildings around the side.
p14
aVBut then there's this mud trap that cuts across the middle.
p15
aVPeople clearly don't want to walk all the way around the edge.
p16
aVInstead, they want to take the shortcut,
p17
aVand that shortcut is self-reinforcing.
p18
aa(lp19
VNow, this shortcut is called a desire path,
p20
aVand it's often the path of least resistance.
p21
aVI find them fascinating,
p22
aVbecause they're often the point where design and user experience diverge.
p23
aa(lp24
VNow at this point, I should apologize,
p25
aVbecause you guys are going to start seeing these everywhere.
p26
aVBut today, I'm going to pick three I find interesting
p27
aVand share what actually it reminds me
p28
aVabout launching new products and services.
p29
aVThe first is in the capital city of Brazil \u2014 Brasilia.
p30
aVAnd it reminds me that sometimes,
p31
aVyou have to just focus on designing for a real need
p32
aVat low friction.
p33
aVNow, Brasilia is fascinating.
p34
aVIt was designed by Niemeyer in the '50s.
p35
aVIt was the golden age of flying,
p36
aVso he laid it out like a plane, as you can see there.
p37
aVSlightly worryingly,
p38
aVhe put most of the important government buildings in the cockpit.
p39
aVBut if you zoom in, in the very center of Brasilia,
p40
aVjust where the point is there,
p41
aVyou see it's littered with desire paths.
p42
aVThey're absolutely everywhere.
p43
aa(lp44
VNow, they thought that they had future-proofed this design.
p45
aVThey thought in the future we wouldn't need to walk anywhere \u2014
p46
aVwe'd be able to drive \u2014
p47
aVso there was little need for walkways or pavements.
p48
aVBut as you can see, there's a real need.
p49
aVThese are very dangerous desire paths.
p50
aVIf we just pick one, in the middle,
p51
aVyou can see it crosses 15 lanes of traffic.
p52
aVIt won't surprise you guys
p53
aVthat Brasilia has five times the pedestrian accident rate
p54
aVof your average US city.
p55
aVPeople are resourceful.
p56
aVThey'll always find the low-friction route
p57
aVto save money, save time.
p58
aa(lp59
VNot all these desire paths are dangerous,
p60
aVI was reminded flying here when I was in Heathrow.
p61
aVMany of us get frustrated when we're confronted
p62
aVwith the obligatory walk through duty-free.
p63
aVIt was amazing to me
p64
aVhow many people refused to take the long, meandering path to the left,
p65
aVand just cut through to the right,
p66
aVcut through the desire path.
p67
aa(lp68
VThe question that's interesting is:
p69
aVWhat do designers think when they see our behavior here?
p70
aVDo they think we're stupid?
p71
aVDo they think we're lazy?
p72
aVOr do they accept that this is the only truth?
p73
aVThis is their product.
p74
aVWe're effectively co-designing their product.
p75
aVSo our job is to design for real needs at low friction,
p76
aVbecause if you don't, the customer will, anyway.
p77
aa(lp78
VThe second desire path I wanted to share
p79
aVis at the University of California.
p80
aVAnd it reminds me
p81
aVthat sometimes the best way to come up with a great design
p82
aVis just to launch it.
p83
aVNow, university campuses are fantastic for spotting desire paths.
p84
aVI think it's because students are always late and they're pretty smart.
p85
aVSo they're dashing to lectures.
p86
aVThey'll always find the shortcut.
p87
aVAnd the designers here knew that.
p88
aVSo they built the buildings
p89
aVand then they waited a few months for the paths to form.
p90
aVThey then paved them.
p91
aV(Laughter)
p92
aVIncredibly smart approach.
p93
aVIn fact, often, just launching the straw man of a service
p94
aVcan teach you what people really want.
p95
aa(lp96
VFor example, Ayr Muir in Boston knew he wanted to open a restaurant.
p97
aVBut where should it be?
p98
aVWhat should the menu be?
p99
aVHe launched a service,
p100
aVin this case a food truck,
p101
aVand he changed the location each day.
p102
aVHe'd write a different menu on the side in a whiteboard marker
p103
aVto figure out what people wanted.
p104
aVHe now has a chain of restaurants.
p105
aVSo it can be incredibly efficient
p106
aVto launch something to spot the desire paths.
p107
aa(lp108
VThe third and final desire path I wanted to share with you
p109
aVis the UNIH.
p110
aVIt reminds me that the world's in flux,
p111
aVand we have to respond to those changes.
p112
aVSo as you'll guess, this is a hospital.
p113
aVI've marked for you on the left the Oncology Department.
p114
aVThe patients would usually stay in the hotels down on the bottom right.
p115
aVThis was a patient-centered organization,
p116
aVso they laid on cars for their patients.
p117
aVBut what they realized when they started offering chemotherapy
p118
aVis the patients rarely wanted to get in cars.
p119
aVThey were too nauseous, so they'd walk back to their hotels.
p120
aVThis desire path that you see diagonally, formed.
p121
aVThe patients even called it "The Chemo Trail."
p122
aVNow, when the hospital saw this originally,
p123
aVthey tried to lay turf back over it, ignore it.
p124
aVBut after a while, they realized it was an important need
p125
aVthey were meeting for their patients,
p126
aVso they paved it.
p127
aa(lp128
VAnd I think our job is often to pave these emerging desire paths.
p129
aVIf we look back at the one in North London again,
p130
aVthat desire path hasn't always been there.
p131
aVThe reason it sprung up
p132
aVis people were traveling to the mighty Arsenal Football Club stadium
p133
aVon game days,
p134
aVfrom the Underground station you see on the bottom right.
p135
aVSo you see the desire path.
p136
aVIf we just wind the clock back a few years,
p137
aVwhen the stadium was being constructed,
p138
aVthere is no desire path.
p139
aa(lp140
VSo our job is to watch for these desire paths emerging,
p141
aVand, where appropriate, pave them,
p142
aVas someone did here.
p143
aVSomeone installed a barrier,
p144
aVpeople started walking across and round the bottom as you see,
p145
aVand they paved it.
p146
aa(lp147
V(Laughter)
p148
aa(lp149
VBut I think this is a wonderful reminder as well,
p150
aVthat, actually, the world is in flux.
p151
aVIt's constantly changing,
p152
aVbecause if you look at the top of this image,
p153
aVthere's another desire path forming.
p154
aa(lp155
VSo these three desire paths remind me
p156
aVwe need to design for real human needs.
p157
aVI think empathy for what your customers want
p158
aVis probably the biggest leading indicator of business success.
p159
aVDesign for real needs
p160
aVand design them in low friction,
p161
aVbecause if you don't offer them in low friction,
p162
aVsomeone else will, often the customer.
p163
aa(lp164
VSecondly, often the best way to learn what people really want
p165
aVis to launch your service.
p166
aVThe answer is rarely inside the building.
p167
aVGet out there and see what people really want.
p168
aa(lp169
VAnd finally, in part because of technology,
p170
aVthe world is incredibly flux at the moment.
p171
aVIt's changing constantly.
p172
aVThese desire paths are going to spring up faster than ever.
p173
aVOur job is to pick the appropriate ones
p174
aVand pave over them.
p175
aa(lp176
VThank you very much.
