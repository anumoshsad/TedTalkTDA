VI will always remember
p4
aVthe first time I met the girl in the blue uniform.
p5
aVI was eight at the time,
p6
aVliving in the village with my grandmother,
p7
aVwho was raising me and other children.
p8
aVFamine had hit my country of Zimbabwe,
p9
aVand we just didn't have enough to eat.
p10
aVWe were hungry.
p11
aVAnd that's when the girl in the blue uniform
p12
aVcame to my village with the United Nations
p13
aVto feed the children.
p14
aa(lp15
VAs she handed me my porridge,
p16
aVI asked her why she was there,
p17
aVand without hesitation, she said,
p18
aV"As Africans, we must uplift all the people of Africa."
p19
aVI had absolutely no idea what she meant.
p20
aa(lp21
V(Laughter)
p22
aa(lp23
VBut her words stuck with me.
p24
aa(lp25
VTwo years later,
p26
aVfamine hit my country for the second time.
p27
aVMy grandmother had no choice but to send me to the city
p28
aVto live with an aunt I had never met before.
p29
aVSo at the age of 10,
p30
aVI found myself in school for the very first time.
p31
aVAnd there, at the city school,
p32
aVI would experience what it was to be unequal.
p33
aVYou see, in the village,
p34
aVwe were all equal.
p35
aVBut in the eyes and the minds of the other kids,
p36
aVI was not their equal.
p37
aVI couldn't speak English,
p38
aVand I was way behind in terms of reading and writing.
p39
aVBut this feeling of inequality would get even more complex.
p40
aVEvery school holiday
p41
aVspent back in the village with my grandmother
p42
aVmade me consciously aware
p43
aVof the inequalities this incredible opportunity
p44
aVhad created within my own family.
p45
aVSuddenly, I had much more than the rest of my village.
p46
aVAnd in their eyes, I was no longer their equal.
p47
aa(lp48
VI felt guilty.
p49
aVBut I thought about the girl in the blue uniform,
p50
aVand I remember thinking,
p51
aV"That's who I want to be \u2014
p52
aVsomeone like her,
p53
aVsomeone who uplifts other people."
p54
aVThis childhood experience led me to the United Nations,
p55
aVand to my current role with UN Women,
p56
aVwhere we are addressing one of the greatest inequalities
p57
aVthat affects more than half of the world's population \u2014
p58
aVwomen and girls.
p59
aa(lp60
VToday, I want to share with you
p61
aVa simple idea that seeks to uplift all of us together.
p62
aVEight months ago,
p63
aVunder the visionary leadership of Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka,
p64
aVhead of UN Women,
p65
aVwe launched a groundbreaking initiative
p66
aVcalled HeForShe,
p67
aVinviting men and boys from around the world
p68
aVto stand in solidarity with each other and with women,
p69
aVto create a shared vision for gender equality.
p70
aVThis is an invitation for those who believe in equality
p71
aVfor women and men,
p72
aVand those who don't yet know that they believe.
p73
aa(lp74
VThe initiative is based on a simple idea:
p75
aVthat what we share is much more powerful
p76
aVthan what divides us.
p77
aVWe all feel the same things.
p78
aVWe all want the same things,
p79
aVeven when those things sometimes remain unspoken.
p80
aVHeForShe is about uplifting all of us,
p81
aVwomen and men together.
p82
aVIt's moving us towards an inflection point for gender equality.
p83
aa(lp84
VImagine a blank page
p85
aVwith one horizontal line splitting it in half.
p86
aVNow imagine that women are represented here,
p87
aVand men are represented here.
p88
aVIn our current population,
p89
aVHeForShe is about moving the 3.2 billion men,
p90
aVone man at a time,
p91
aVacross that line,
p92
aVso that ultimately, men can stand alongside women
p93
aVand be on the right side of history,
p94
aVmaking gender equality a reality in the 21st century.
p95
aa(lp96
VHowever, engaging men in the movement would prove quite controversial.
p97
aVWhy invite men? They are the problem.
p98
aa(lp99
V(Laughter)
p100
aa(lp101
VIn fact, men don't care, we were told.
p102
aa(lp103
VBut something incredible happened when we launched HeForShe.
p104
aVIn just three days, more than 100,000 men
p105
aVhad signed up and committed to be agents of change for equality.
p106
aVWithin that first week, at least one man in every single country in the world
p107
aVstood up to be counted,
p108
aVand within that same week,
p109
aVHeForShe created more than 1.2 billion conversations on social media.
p110
aVAnd that's when the emails started pouring in,
p111
aVsometimes as many as a thousand a day.
p112
aVWe heard from a man out of Zimbabwe,
p113
aVwho, after hearing about HeForShe,
p114
aVcreated a "husband school."
p115
aa(lp116
V(Laughter)
p117
aa(lp118
VHe literally went around his village,
p119
aVhand-picking all of the men that were abusive to their partners,
p120
aVand committed to turn them into better husbands and fathers.
p121
aVIn Pune, India, a youth advocate organized an innovative bicycle rally,
p122
aVmobilizing 700 cyclists
p123
aVto share the HeForShe messages within their own community.
p124
aa(lp125
VIn another impact story,
p126
aVa man sent a very personal note
p127
aVof something that had happened in his own community.
p128
aVHe wrote,
p129
aV"Dear Madam,
p130
aVI have lived all of my life
p131
aVnext door to a man who continuously beats up his wife.
p132
aVTwo weeks ago,
p133
aVI was listening to my radio,
p134
aVand your voice came on,
p135
aVand you spoke about something called the HeForShe,
p136
aVand the need for men to play their role.
p137
aVWithin a few hours, I heard the woman cry again next door,
p138
aVbut for the first time,
p139
aVI didn't just sit there.
p140
aVI felt compelled to do something,
p141
aVso I went over and I confronted the husband.
p142
aVMadam, it has been two weeks,
p143
aVand the woman has not cried since.
p144
aVThank you for giving me a voice."
p145
aa(lp146
V(Applause)
p147
aa(lp148
VPersonal impact stories such as these
p149
aVshow that we are tapping into something within men,
p150
aVbut getting to a world where women and men are equal
p151
aVis not just a matter of bringing men to the cause.
p152
aVWe want concrete, systematic, structural change that can equalize
p153
aVthe political, economic and social realities for women and men.
p154
aVWe are asking men to make concrete actions,
p155
aVcalling them to intervene at a personal level,
p156
aVto change their behavior.
p157
aVWe are calling upon governments, businesses, universities,
p158
aVto change their policies.
p159
aVWe want male leaders to become role models
p160
aVand change agents within their own institutions.
p161
aa(lp162
VAlready, a number of prominent men and leaders have stepped up
p163
aVand made some concrete HeForShe commitments.
p164
aVIn a few early success stories,
p165
aVa leading French hospitality company, Accor,
p166
aVhas committed to eliminate the pay gap
p167
aVfor all of its 180,000 employees by 2020.
p168
aa(lp169
V(Applause)
p170
aa(lp171
VThe government of Sweden,
p172
aVunder its current feminist government,
p173
aVhas committed to close both the employment and the pay gap
p174
aVfor all of its citizens within the current electoral term.
p175
aVIn Japan, the University of Nagoya
p176
aVis building, as part of their HeForShe commitments,
p177
aVwhat will become one of Japan's leading gender-research centers.
p178
aa(lp179
VNow, eight months later,
p180
aVa movement is building.
p181
aVWe are seeing men sign up from every single walk of life,
p182
aVand from every single corner in the world,
p183
aVfrom the United Nations' own Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon
p184
aVto the Secretary-Generals of NATO and the EU Council,
p185
aVfrom the prime minister of Bhutan
p186
aVto the president of Sierra Leone.
p187
aa(lp188
VIn Europe alone, all the male EU Commissioners
p189
aVand the members of Parliament of the Swedish and Iceland governments
p190
aVhave signed up to be HeForShe.
p191
aVIn fact, one in 20 men in Iceland has joined the movement.
p192
aVThe rallying call of our passionate goodwill ambassador, Emma Watson,
p193
aVhas garnered more than five billion media impressions,
p194
aVmobilizing hundreds and thousands of students around the world
p195
aVto create more than a hundred HeForShe student associations.
p196
aa(lp197
VNow this is the beginning of the vision that HeForShe has
p198
aVfor the world that we want to see.
p199
aVEinstein once said,
p200
aV"A human being is part of the whole ...
p201
aVbut he experiences himself,
p202
aVhis thoughts and feelings,
p203
aVas something separate from the rest ...
p204
aVThis delusion is a kind of prison for us ...
p205
aVOur task must be to free ourselves from this prison
p206
aVby widening our circle of compassion."
p207
aa(lp208
VIf women and men are part of a greater whole,
p209
aVas Einstein suggests,
p210
aVit is my hope that HeForShe can help free us to realize
p211
aVthat it is not our gender that defines us,
p212
aVbut ultimately, our shared humanity.
p213
aVHeForShe is tapping into women's and men's dreams,
p214
aVthe dreams that we have for ourselves,
p215
aVand the dreams that we have for our families, our children,
p216
aVfriends, communities.
p217
aa(lp218
VSo that's what it is about.
p219
aVHeForShe is about uplifting all of us together.
p220
aa(lp221
VThank you.
