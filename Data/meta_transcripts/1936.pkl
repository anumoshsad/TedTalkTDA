VHere are some images of clusters of galaxies.
p4
aVThey're exactly what they sound like.
p5
aVThey are these huge collections of galaxies,
p6
aVbound together by their mutual gravity.
p7
aVSo most of the points that you see on the screen
p8
aVare not individual stars,
p9
aVbut collections of stars, or galaxies.
p10
aa(lp11
VNow, by showing you some of these images,
p12
aVI hope that you will quickly see that
p13
aVgalaxy clusters are these beautiful objects,
p14
aVbut more than that,
p15
aVI think galaxy clusters are mysterious,
p16
aVthey are surprising,
p17
aVand they're useful.
p18
aVUseful as the universe's most massive laboratories.
p19
aVAnd as laboratories, to describe galaxy clusters
p20
aVis to describe the experiments
p21
aVthat you can do with them.
p22
aa(lp23
VAnd I think there are four major types,
p24
aVand the first type that I want to describe
p25
aVis probing the very big.
p26
aVSo, how big?
p27
aVWell, here is an image of a particular galaxy cluster.
p28
aVIt is so massive that the light passing through it
p29
aVis being bent, it's being distorted
p30
aVby the extreme gravity of this cluster.
p31
aVAnd, in fact, if you look very carefully
p32
aVyou'll be able to see rings around this cluster.
p33
aVNow, to give you a number,
p34
aVthis particular galaxy cluster
p35
aVhas a mass of over one million billion suns.
p36
aVIt's just mind-boggling how  massive these systems can get.
p37
aVBut more than their mass,
p38
aVthey have this additional feature.
p39
aVThey are essentially isolated systems,
p40
aVso if we like, we can think of them
p41
aVas a scaled-down version of the entire universe.
p42
aVAnd many of the questions that we might have
p43
aVabout the universe at large scales,
p44
aVsuch as, how does gravity work?
p45
aVmight be answered by studying these systems.
p46
aa(lp47
VSo that was very big.
p48
aVThe second things is very hot.
p49
aVOkay, if I take an image of a galaxy cluster,
p50
aVand I subtract away all of the starlight,
p51
aVwhat I'm left with is this big, blue blob.
p52
aVThis is in false color.
p53
aVIt's actually X-ray light that we're seeing.
p54
aVAnd the question is, if it's not galaxies,
p55
aVwhat is emitting this light?
p56
aVThe answer is hot gas,
p57
aVmillion-degree gas \u2014
p58
aVin fact, it's plasma.
p59
aVAnd the reason why it's so hot
p60
aVgoes back to the previous slide.
p61
aVThe extreme gravity of these systems
p62
aVis accelerating particles of gas to great speeds,
p63
aVand great speeds means great temperatures.
p64
aVSo this is the main idea,
p65
aVbut science is a rough draft.
p66
aVThere are many basic properties about this plasma
p67
aVthat still confuse us,
p68
aVstill puzzle us,
p69
aVand still push our understanding
p70
aVof the physics of the very hot.
p71
aa(lp72
VThird thing: probing the very small.
p73
aVNow, to explain this, I need to tell you
p74
aVa very disturbing fact.
p75
aVMost of the universe's matter
p76
aVis not made up of atoms.
p77
aVYou were lied to.
p78
aVMost of it is made up of something  very, very mysterious,
p79
aVwhich we call dark matter.
p80
aVDark matter is something that  doesn't like to interact very much,
p81
aVexcept through gravity,
p82
aVand of course we would like to learn more about it.
p83
aVIf you're a particle physicist,
p84
aVyou want to know what happens  when we smash things together.
p85
aVAnd dark matter is no exception.
p86
aa(lp87
VWell, how do we do this?
p88
aVTo answer that question,
p89
aVI'm going to have to ask another one,
p90
aVwhich is, what happens when galaxy clusters collide?
p91
aVHere is an image.
p92
aVSince galaxy clusters are representative
p93
aVslices of the universe, scaled-down versions.
p94
aVThey are mostly made up of dark matter,
p95
aVand that's what you see in this bluish purple.
p96
aVThe red represents the hot gas,
p97
aVand, of course, you can see many galaxies.
p98
aVWhat's happened is a particle accelerator
p99
aVat a huge, huge scale.
p100
aVAnd this is very important,
p101
aVbecause what it means is that very, very small
p102
aVeffects that might be difficult to detect in the lab,
p103
aVmight be compounded and compounded
p104
aVinto something that we could  possibly observe in nature.
p105
aVSo, it's very funny.
p106
aVThe reason why galaxy clusters
p107
aVcan teach us about dark matter,
p108
aVthe reason why galaxy clusters
p109
aVcan teach us about the physics of the very small,
p110
aVis precisely because they are so very big.
p111
aa(lp112
VFourth thing: the physics of the very strange.
p113
aVCertainly what I've said so far is crazy.
p114
aVOkay, if there's anything stranger
p115
aVI think it has to be dark energy.
p116
aVIf I throw a ball into the air,
p117
aVI expect it to go up.
p118
aVWhat I don't expect is that it go up
p119
aVat an ever-increasing rate.
p120
aVSimilarly, cosmologists understand why
p121
aVthe universe is expanding.
p122
aVThey don't understand why it's expanding
p123
aVat an ever-increasing rate.
p124
aVThey give the cause of this
p125
aVaccelerated expansion a name,
p126
aVand they call it dark energy.
p127
aVAnd, again, we want to learn more about it.
p128
aa(lp129
VSo, one particular question that we have is,
p130
aVhow does dark energy affect the universe
p131
aVat the largest scales?
p132
aVDepending on how strong it is,
p133
aVmaybe structure forms faster or slower.
p134
aVWell, the problem with the large-scale structure
p135
aVof the universe is that it's horribly complicated.
p136
aVHere is a computer simulation.
p137
aVAnd we need a way to simplify it.
p138
aVWell, I like to think about this using an analogy.
p139
aVIf I want to understand the sinking of the Titanic,
p140
aVthe most important thing to do
p141
aVis not to model the little positions
p142
aVof every single little piece of the boat that broke off.
p143
aVThe most important thing to do is
p144
aVto track the two biggest parts.
p145
aVSimilarly, I can learn a lot about the universe
p146
aVat the largest scales
p147
aVby tracking its biggest pieces
p148
aVand those biggest pieces are clusters of galaxies.
p149
aa(lp150
VSo, as I come to a close,
p151
aVyou might feel slightly cheated.
p152
aVI mean, I began by talking about
p153
aVhow galaxy clusters are useful,
p154
aVand I've given some reasons,
p155
aVbut what is their use really?
p156
aVWell, to answer this,
p157
aVI want to give you a quote by Henry Ford
p158
aVwhen he was asked about cars.
p159
aVHe had this to say:
p160
aV"If I had asked people what they wanted,
p161
aVthey would have said faster horses."
p162
aVToday, we as a society are faced
p163
aVwith many, many difficult problems.
p164
aVAnd the solutions to these  problems are not obvious.
p165
aVThey are not faster horses.
p166
aVThey will require an enormous amount of
p167
aVscientific ingenuity.
p168
aa(lp169
VSo, yes, we need to focus,
p170
aVyes, we need to concentrate,
p171
aVbut we also need to remember that
p172
aVinnovation, ingenuity, inspiration \u2014
p173
aVthese things come
p174
aVwhen we broaden our field of vision
p175
aVwhen we step back
p176
aVwhen we zoom out.
p177
aVAnd I can't think of a better way to do this than
p178
aVby studying the universe around us. Thanks.
