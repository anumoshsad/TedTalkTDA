VVision is the most important
p4
aVand prioritized sense that we have.
p5
aVWe are constantly looking
p6
aVat the world around us,
p7
aVand quickly we identify and make sense
p8
aVof what it is that we see.
p9
aa(lp10
VLet's just start with an example
p11
aVof that very fact.
p12
aVI'm going to show you a photograph of a person,
p13
aVjust for a second or two,
p14
aVand I'd like for you to identify
p15
aVwhat emotion is on his face.
p16
aVReady?
p17
aVHere you go. Go with your gut reaction.
p18
aVOkay. What did you see?
p19
aVWell, we actually surveyed
p20
aVover 120 individuals,
p21
aVand the results were mixed.
p22
aVPeople did not agree
p23
aVon what emotion they saw on his face.
p24
aVMaybe you saw discomfort.
p25
aVThat was the most frequent response
p26
aVthat we received.
p27
aVBut if you asked the person on your left,
p28
aVthey might have said regret or skepticism,
p29
aVand if you asked somebody on your right,
p30
aVthey might have said something entirely different,
p31
aVlike hope or empathy.
p32
aVSo we are all looking
p33
aVat the very same face again.
p34
aVWe might see something
p35
aVentirely different,
p36
aVbecause perception is subjective.
p37
aVWhat we think we see
p38
aVis actually filtered
p39
aVthrough our own mind's eye.
p40
aa(lp41
VOf course, there are many other examples
p42
aVof how we see the world through own mind's eye.
p43
aVI'm going to give you just a few.
p44
aVSo dieters, for instance,
p45
aVsee apples as larger
p46
aVthan people who are not counting calories.
p47
aVSoftball players see the ball as smaller
p48
aVif they've just come out of a slump,
p49
aVcompared to people who  had a hot night at the plate.
p50
aVAnd actually, our political beliefs also
p51
aVcan affect the way we see other people,
p52
aVincluding politicians.
p53
aVSo my research team and I decided to test this question.
p54
aVIn 2008, Barack Obama was running for president
p55
aVfor the very first time,
p56
aVand we surveyed hundreds of Americans
p57
aVone month before the election.
p58
aVWhat we found in this survey
p59
aVwas that some people, some Americans,
p60
aVthink photographs like these
p61
aVbest reflect how Obama really looks.
p62
aVOf these people, 75 percent
p63
aVvoted for Obama in the actual election.
p64
aVOther people, though, thought photographs like these
p65
aVbest reflect how Obama really looks.
p66
aV89 percent of these people
p67
aVvoted for McCain.
p68
aVWe presented many photographs of Obama
p69
aVone at a time,
p70
aVso people did not realize that what we were changing
p71
aVfrom one photograph to the next
p72
aVwas whether we had artificially lightened
p73
aVor darkened his skin tone.
p74
aa(lp75
VSo how is that possible?
p76
aVHow could it be that when I look at a person,
p77
aVan object, or an event,
p78
aVI see something very different
p79
aVthan somebody else does?
p80
aVWell, the reasons are many,
p81
aVbut one reason requires that we understand
p82
aVa little bit more about how our eyes work.
p83
aVSo vision scientists know
p84
aVthat the amount of information
p85
aVthat we can see
p86
aVat any given point in time,
p87
aVwhat we can focus on, is actually relatively small.
p88
aVWhat we can see with great sharpness
p89
aVand clarity and accuracy
p90
aVis the equivalent
p91
aVof the surface area of our thumb
p92
aVon our outstretched arm.
p93
aVEverything else around that is blurry,
p94
aVrendering much of what is presented
p95
aVto our eyes as ambiguous.
p96
aVBut we have to clarify
p97
aVand make sense of what it is that we see,
p98
aVand it's our mind that helps us fill in that gap.
p99
aVAs a result, perception is a subjective experience,
p100
aVand that's how we end up seeing
p101
aVthrough our own mind's eye.
p102
aa(lp103
VSo, I'm a social psychologist,
p104
aVand it's questions like these
p105
aVthat really intrigue me.
p106
aVI am fascinated by those times
p107
aVwhen people do not see eye to eye.
p108
aVWhy is it that somebody might
p109
aVliterally see the glass as half full,
p110
aVand somebody literally sees it
p111
aVas half empty?
p112
aVWhat is it about what one person is thinking and feeling
p113
aVthat leads them to see the world
p114
aVin an entirely different way?
p115
aVAnd does that even matter?
p116
aVSo to begin to tackle these questions,
p117
aVmy research team and I decided to delve deeply
p118
aVinto an issue that has received
p119
aVinternational attention:
p120
aVour health and fitness.
p121
aVAcross the world,
p122
aVpeople are struggling to manage their weight,
p123
aVand there is a variety of strategies
p124
aVthat we have to help us keep the pounds off.
p125
aVFor instance, we set the best of intentions
p126
aVto exercise after the holidays,
p127
aVbut actually, the majority of Americans
p128
aVfind that their New Year's resolutions
p129
aVare broken by Valentine's Day.
p130
aVWe talk to ourselves
p131
aVin very encouraging ways,
p132
aVtelling ourselves this is our year
p133
aVto get back into shape,
p134
aVbut that is not enough to bring us back
p135
aVto our ideal weight.
p136
aVSo why?
p137
aVOf course, there is no simple answer,
p138
aVbut one reason, I argue,
p139
aVis that our mind's eye
p140
aVmight work against us.
p141
aVSome people may literally see exercise
p142
aVas more difficult,
p143
aVand some people might literally
p144
aVsee exercise as easier.
p145
aa(lp146
VSo, as a first step to testing these questions,
p147
aVwe gathered objective measurements
p148
aVof individuals' physical fitness.
p149
aVWe measured the  circumference of their waist,
p150
aVcompared to the  circumference of their hips.
p151
aVA higher waist-to-hip ratio
p152
aVis an indicator of being less physically fit
p153
aVthan a lower waist-to-hip ratio.
p154
aVAfter gathering these measurements,
p155
aVwe told our participants that
p156
aVthey would walk to a finish line
p157
aVwhile carrying extra weight
p158
aVin a sort of race.
p159
aVBut before they did that,
p160
aVwe asked them to estimate the distance
p161
aVto the finish line.
p162
aVWe thought that the physical states of their body
p163
aVmight change how they perceived the distance.
p164
aVSo what did we find?
p165
aVWell, waist-to-hip ratio
p166
aVpredicted perceptions of distance.
p167
aVPeople who were out of shape and unfit
p168
aVactually saw the distance to the finish line
p169
aVas significantly greater
p170
aVthan people who were in better shape.
p171
aVPeople's states of their own body
p172
aVchanged how they perceived the environment.
p173
aVBut so too can our mind.
p174
aVIn fact, our bodies and our minds
p175
aVwork in tandem
p176
aVto change how we see the world around us.
p177
aa(lp178
VThat led us to think that maybe people
p179
aVwith strong motivations
p180
aVand strong goals to exercise
p181
aVmight actually see the finish line as closer
p182
aVthan people who have weaker motivations.
p183
aVSo to test whether motivations
p184
aVaffect our perceptual experiences in this way,
p185
aVwe conducted a second study.
p186
aVAgain, we gathered objective measurements
p187
aVof people's physical fitness,
p188
aVmeasuring the circumference of their waist
p189
aVand the circumference of their hips,
p190
aVand we had them do a  few other tests of fitness.
p191
aVBased on feedback that we gave them,
p192
aVsome of our participants told us
p193
aVthey're not motivated to exercise any more.
p194
aVThey felt like they already met their fitness goals
p195
aVand they weren't going to do anything else.
p196
aVThese people were not motivated.
p197
aVOther people, though,  based on our feedback,
p198
aVtold us they were highly  motivated to exercise.
p199
aVThey had a strong goal to make it to the finish line.
p200
aVBut again, before we had them walk to the finish line,
p201
aVwe had them estimate the distance.
p202
aVHow far away was the finish line?
p203
aVAnd again, like the previous study,
p204
aVwe found that waist-to-hip ratio
p205
aVpredicted perceptions of distance.
p206
aVUnfit individuals saw the distance as farther,
p207
aVsaw the finish line as farther away,
p208
aVthan people who were in better shape.
p209
aVImportantly, though, this only happened
p210
aVfor people who were not motivated
p211
aVto exercise.
p212
aVOn the other hand,
p213
aVpeople who were highly motivated to exercise
p214
aVsaw the distance as short.
p215
aVEven the most out of shape individuals
p216
aVsaw the finish line
p217
aVas just as close,
p218
aVif not slightly closer,
p219
aVthan people who were in better shape.
p220
aa(lp221
VSo our bodies can change
p222
aVhow far away that finish line looks,
p223
aVbut people who had committed to a manageable goal
p224
aVthat they could accomplish in the near future
p225
aVand who believed that they were capable
p226
aVof meeting that goal
p227
aVactually saw the exercise as easier.
p228
aVThat led us to wonder,
p229
aVis there a strategy that we could use
p230
aVand teach people that would help
p231
aVchange their perceptions of the distance,
p232
aVhelp them make exercise look easier?
p233
aa(lp234
VSo we turned to the vision science literature
p235
aVto figure out what should we do,
p236
aVand based on what we read, we came up with a strategy
p237
aVthat we called, "Keep  your eyes on the prize."
p238
aVSo this is not the slogan
p239
aVfrom an inspirational poster.
p240
aVIt's an actual directive
p241
aVfor how to look around your environment.
p242
aVPeople that we trained in this strategy,
p243
aVwe told them to focus their attention on the finish line,
p244
aVto avoid looking around,
p245
aVto imagine a spotlight
p246
aVwas shining on that goal,
p247
aVand that everything around it was blurry
p248
aVand perhaps difficult to see.
p249
aVWe thought that this strategy
p250
aVwould help make the exercise look easier.
p251
aVWe compared this group
p252
aVto a baseline group.
p253
aVTo this group we said,
p254
aVjust look around the environment
p255
aVas you naturally would.
p256
aVYou will notice the finish line,
p257
aVbut you might also notice
p258
aVthe garbage can off to the right,
p259
aVor the people and the  lamp post off to the left.
p260
aVWe thought that people who used this strategy
p261
aVwould see the distance as farther.
p262
aa(lp263
VSo what did we find?
p264
aVWhen we had them estimate the distance,
p265
aVwas this strategy successful
p266
aVfor changing their perceptual experience?
p267
aVYes.
p268
aVPeople who kept their eyes on the prize
p269
aVsaw the finish line as 30 percent closer
p270
aVthan people who looked around
p271
aVas they naturally would.
p272
aVWe thought this was great.
p273
aVWe were really excited because it meant
p274
aVthat this strategy helped make
p275
aVthe exercise look easier,
p276
aVbut the big question was,
p277
aVcould this help make exercise
p278
aVactually better?
p279
aVCould it improve the quality
p280
aVof exercise as well?
p281
aa(lp282
VSo next, we told our participants,
p283
aVyou are going to walk to the finish line
p284
aVwhile wearing extra weight.
p285
aVWe added weights to their ankles
p286
aVthat amounted to 15 percent of their body weight.
p287
aVWe told them to lift their knees up high
p288
aVand walk to the finish line quickly.
p289
aVWe designed this exercise in particular
p290
aVto be moderately challenging
p291
aVbut not impossible,
p292
aVlike most exercises
p293
aVthat actually improve our fitness.
p294
aa(lp295
VSo the big question, then:
p296
aVDid keeping your eyes on the prize
p297
aVand narrowly focusing on the finish line
p298
aVchange their experience of the exercise?
p299
aVIt did.
p300
aVPeople who kept their eyes on the prize
p301
aVtold us afterward that it required
p302
aV17 percent less exertion
p303
aVfor them to do this exercise
p304
aVthan people who looked around naturally.
p305
aVIt changed their subjective experience
p306
aVof the exercise.
p307
aVIt also changed the objective nature
p308
aVof their exercise.
p309
aVPeople who kept their eyes on the prize
p310
aVactually moved 23 percent faster
p311
aVthan people who looked around naturally.
p312
aVTo put that in perspective,
p313
aVa 23 percent increase
p314
aVis like trading in your 1980 Chevy Citation
p315
aVfor a 1980 Chevrolet Corvette.
p316
aa(lp317
VWe were so excited by this,
p318
aVbecause this meant that a strategy
p319
aVthat costs nothing,
p320
aVthat is easy for people to use,
p321
aVregardless of whether they're in shape
p322
aVor struggling to get there,
p323
aVhad a big effect.
p324
aVKeeping your eyes on the prize
p325
aVmade the exercise look and feel easier
p326
aVeven when people were working harder
p327
aVbecause they were moving faster.
p328
aVNow, I know there's more to good health
p329
aVthan walking a little bit faster,
p330
aVbut keeping your eyes on the prize
p331
aVmight be one additional strategy
p332
aVthat you can use to help promote
p333
aVa healthy lifestyle.
p334
aa(lp335
VIf you're not convinced yet
p336
aVthat we all see the world through our own mind's eye,
p337
aVlet me leave you with one final example.
p338
aVHere's a photograph of a beautiful  street in Stockholm, with two cars.
p339
aVThe car in the back looks much larger
p340
aVthan the car in the front.
p341
aVHowever, in reality,
p342
aVthese cars are the same size,
p343
aVbut that's not how we see it.
p344
aVSo does this mean that
p345
aVour eyes have gone haywire
p346
aVand that our brains are a mess?
p347
aVNo, it doesn't mean that at all.
p348
aVIt's just how our eyes work.
p349
aVWe might see the world in a different way,
p350
aVand sometimes that might not
p351
aVline up with reality,
p352
aVbut it doesn't mean that one of us is right
p353
aVand one of us is wrong.
p354
aVWe all see the world through our mind's eye,
p355
aVbut we can teach ourselves to see it differently.
p356
aa(lp357
VSo I can think of days
p358
aVthat have gone horribly wrong for me.
p359
aVI'm fed up, I'm grumpy, I'm tired,
p360
aVand I'm so behind,
p361
aVand there's a big black cloud
p362
aVhanging over my head,
p363
aVand on days like these,
p364
aVit looks like everyone around me
p365
aVis down in the dumps too.
p366
aVMy colleague at work looks annoyed
p367
aVwhen I ask for an extension on a deadline,
p368
aVand my friend looks frustrated
p369
aVwhen I show up late for lunch because a meeting ran long,
p370
aVand at the end of the day,
p371
aVmy husband looks disappointed
p372
aVbecause I'd rather go to  bed than go to the movies.
p373
aVAnd on days like these, when everybody looks
p374
aVupset and angry to me,
p375
aVI try to remind myself that there are other ways of seeing them.
p376
aVPerhaps my colleague was confused,
p377
aVperhaps my friend was concerned,
p378
aVand perhaps my husband was  feeling empathy instead.
p379
aVSo we all see the world
p380
aVthrough our own mind's eye,
p381
aVand on some days, it might look
p382
aVlike the world is a dangerous
p383
aVand challenging and insurmountable place,
p384
aVbut it doesn't have to look that way all the time.
p385
aVWe can teach ourselves to see it differently,
p386
aVand when we find a way to make the world
p387
aVlook nicer and easier,
p388
aVit might actually become so.
