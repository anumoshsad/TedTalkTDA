VOne day in 1819,
p4
aV3,000 miles off the coast of Chile,
p5
aVin one of the most remote regions of the Pacific Ocean,
p6
aV20 American sailors watched their ship flood with seawater.
p7
aVThey'd been struck by a sperm whale, which had ripped
p8
aVa catastrophic hole in the ship's hull.
p9
aVAs their ship began to sink beneath the swells,
p10
aVthe men huddled together in three small whaleboats.
p11
aVThese men were 10,000 miles from home,
p12
aVmore than 1,000 miles from the nearest scrap of land.
p13
aVIn their small boats, they carried only
p14
aVrudimentary navigational equipment
p15
aVand limited supplies of food and water.
p16
aVThese were the men of the whaleship Essex,
p17
aVwhose story would later inspire parts of "Moby Dick."
p18
aa(lp19
VEven in today's world, their situation would be really dire,
p20
aVbut think about how much worse it would have been then.
p21
aVNo one on land had any idea that anything had gone wrong.
p22
aVNo search party was coming to look for these men.
p23
aVSo most of us have never experienced a situation
p24
aVas frightening as the one in which these sailors found themselves,
p25
aVbut we all know what it's like to be afraid.
p26
aVWe know how fear feels,
p27
aVbut I'm not sure we spend enough time thinking about
p28
aVwhat our fears mean.
p29
aa(lp30
VAs we grow up, we're often encouraged to think of fear
p31
aVas a weakness, just another childish thing to discard
p32
aVlike baby teeth or roller skates.
p33
aVAnd I think it's no accident that we think this way.
p34
aVNeuroscientists have actually shown that human beings
p35
aVare hard-wired to be optimists.
p36
aVSo maybe that's why we think of fear, sometimes,
p37
aVas a danger in and of itself.
p38
aV"Don't worry," we like to say to one another. "Don't panic."
p39
aVIn English, fear is something we conquer.
p40
aVIt's something we fight. It's something we overcome.
p41
aVBut what if we looked at fear in a fresh way?
p42
aVWhat if we thought of fear as an amazing act of the imagination,
p43
aVsomething that can be as profound and insightful
p44
aVas storytelling itself?
p45
aa(lp46
VIt's easiest to see this link between fear and the imagination
p47
aVin young children, whose fears are often extraordinarily vivid.
p48
aVWhen I was a child, I lived in California,
p49
aVwhich is, you know, mostly a very nice place to live,
p50
aVbut for me as a child, California could also be a little scary.
p51
aVI remember how frightening it was to see the chandelier
p52
aVthat hung above our dining table swing back and forth
p53
aVduring every minor earthquake,
p54
aVand I sometimes couldn't sleep at night, terrified
p55
aVthat the Big One might strike while we were sleeping.
p56
aVAnd what we say about kids who have fears like that
p57
aVis that they have a vivid imagination.
p58
aVBut at a certain point, most of us learn
p59
aVto leave these kinds of visions behind and grow up.
p60
aVWe learn that there are no monsters hiding under the bed,
p61
aVand not every earthquake brings buildings down.
p62
aVBut maybe it's no coincidence that some of our most creative minds
p63
aVfail to leave these kinds of fears behind as adults.
p64
aVThe same incredible imaginations that produced "The Origin of Species,"
p65
aV"Jane Eyre" and "The Remembrance of Things Past,"
p66
aValso generated intense worries that haunted the adult lives
p67
aVof Charles Darwin, Charlotte Bront\u0102\u0164 and Marcel Proust.
p68
aVSo the question is, what can the rest of us learn about fear
p69
aVfrom visionaries and young children?
p70
aa(lp71
VWell let's return to the year 1819 for a moment,
p72
aVto the situation facing the crew of the whaleship Essex.
p73
aVLet's take a look at the fears that their imaginations
p74
aVwere generating as they drifted in the middle of the Pacific.
p75
aVTwenty-four hours had now passed since the capsizing of the ship.
p76
aVThe time had come for the men to make a plan,
p77
aVbut they had very few options.
p78
aVIn his fascinating account of the disaster,
p79
aVNathaniel Philbrick wrote that these men were just about
p80
aVas far from land as it was possible to be anywhere on Earth.
p81
aVThe men knew that the nearest islands they could reach
p82
aVwere the Marquesas Islands, 1,200 miles away.
p83
aVBut they'd heard some frightening rumors.
p84
aVThey'd been told that these islands,
p85
aVand several others nearby, were populated by cannibals.
p86
aVSo the men pictured coming ashore only to be murdered
p87
aVand eaten for dinner.
p88
aVAnother possible destination was Hawaii,
p89
aVbut given the season, the captain was afraid
p90
aVthey'd be struck by severe storms.
p91
aVNow the last option was the longest, and the most difficult:
p92
aVto sail 1,500 miles due south in hopes of reaching
p93
aVa certain band of winds that could eventually
p94
aVpush them toward the coast of South America.
p95
aVBut they knew that the sheer length of this journey
p96
aVwould stretch their supplies of food and water.
p97
aVTo be eaten by cannibals, to be battered by storms,
p98
aVto starve to death before reaching land.
p99
aVThese were the fears that danced in the imaginations of these poor men,
p100
aVand as it turned out, the fear they chose to listen to
p101
aVwould govern whether they lived or died.
p102
aa(lp103
VNow we might just as easily call these fears by a different name.
p104
aVWhat if instead of calling them fears,
p105
aVwe called them stories?
p106
aVBecause that's really what fear is, if you think about it.
p107
aVIt's a kind of unintentional storytelling
p108
aVthat we are all born knowing how to do.
p109
aVAnd fears and storytelling have the same components.
p110
aVThey have the same architecture.
p111
aVLike all stories, fears have characters.
p112
aVIn our fears, the characters are us.
p113
aVFears also have plots. They have beginnings and middles and ends.
p114
aVYou board the plane. The plane takes off. The engine fails.
p115
aVOur fears also tend to contain imagery that can be
p116
aVevery bit as vivid as what you might find in the pages of a novel.
p117
aVPicture a cannibal, human teeth
p118
aVsinking into human skin,
p119
aVhuman flesh roasting over a fire.
p120
aVFears also have suspense.
p121
aVIf I've done my job as a storyteller today,
p122
aVyou should be wondering what happened
p123
aVto the men of the whaleship Essex.
p124
aVOur fears provoke in us a very similar form of suspense.
p125
aVJust like all great stories, our fears focus our attention
p126
aVon a question that is as important in life as it is in literature:
p127
aVWhat will happen next?
p128
aVIn other words, our fears make us think about the future.
p129
aVAnd humans, by the way, are the only creatures capable
p130
aVof thinking about the future in this way,
p131
aVof projecting ourselves forward in time,
p132
aVand this mental time travel is just one more thing
p133
aVthat fears have in common with storytelling.
p134
aa(lp135
VAs a writer, I can tell you that a big part of writing fiction
p136
aVis learning to predict how one event in a story
p137
aVwill affect all the other events,
p138
aVand fear works in that same way.
p139
aVIn fear, just like in fiction, one thing always leads to another.
p140
aVWhen I was writing my first novel, "The Age Of Miracles,"
p141
aVI spent months trying to figure out what would happen
p142
aVif the rotation of the Earth suddenly began to slow down.
p143
aVWhat would happen to our days? What would happen to our crops?
p144
aVWhat would happen to our minds?
p145
aVAnd then it was only later that I realized how very similar
p146
aVthese questions were to the ones I used to ask myself
p147
aVas a child frightened in the night.
p148
aVIf an earthquake strikes tonight, I used to worry,
p149
aVwhat will happen to our house? What will happen to my family?
p150
aVAnd the answer to those questions always took the form of a story.
p151
aVSo if we think of our fears as more than just fears
p152
aVbut as stories, we should think of ourselves
p153
aVas the authors of those stories.
p154
aVBut just as importantly, we need to think of ourselves
p155
aVas the readers of our fears, and how we choose
p156
aVto read our fears can have a profound effect on our lives.
p157
aa(lp158
VNow, some of us naturally read our fears more closely than others.
p159
aVI read about a study recently of successful entrepreneurs,
p160
aVand the author found that these people shared a habit
p161
aVthat he called "productive paranoia," which meant that
p162
aVthese people, instead of dismissing their fears,
p163
aVthese people read them closely, they studied them,
p164
aVand then they translated that fear into preparation and action.
p165
aVSo that way, if their worst fears came true,
p166
aVtheir businesses were ready.
p167
aa(lp168
VAnd sometimes, of course, our worst fears do come true.
p169
aVThat's one of the things that is so extraordinary about fear.
p170
aVOnce in a while, our fears can predict the future.
p171
aVBut we can't possibly prepare for all of the fears
p172
aVthat our imaginations concoct.
p173
aVSo how can we tell the difference between
p174
aVthe fears worth listening to and all the others?
p175
aVI think the end of the story of the whaleship Essex
p176
aVoffers an illuminating, if tragic, example.
p177
aVAfter much deliberation, the men finally made a decision.
p178
aVTerrified of cannibals, they decided to forgo the closest islands
p179
aVand instead embarked on the longer
p180
aVand much more difficult route to South America.
p181
aVAfter more than two months at sea, the men ran out of food
p182
aVas they knew they might,
p183
aVand they were still quite far from land.
p184
aVWhen the last of the survivors were finally picked up
p185
aVby two passing ships, less than half of the men were left alive,
p186
aVand some of them had resorted to their own form of cannibalism.
p187
aVHerman Melville, who used this story as research for "Moby Dick,"
p188
aVwrote years later, and from dry land, quote,
p189
aV"All the sufferings of these miserable men of the Essex
p190
aVmight in all human probability have been avoided
p191
aVhad they, immediately after leaving the wreck,
p192
aVsteered straight for Tahiti.
p193
aVBut," as Melville put it, "they dreaded cannibals."
p194
aVSo the question is, why did these men dread cannibals
p195
aVso much more than the extreme likelihood of starvation?
p196
aVWhy were they swayed by one story
p197
aVso much more than the other?
p198
aVLooked at from this angle,
p199
aVtheirs becomes a story about reading.
p200
aVThe novelist Vladimir Nabokov said that the best reader
p201
aVhas a combination of two very different temperaments,
p202
aVthe artistic and the scientific.
p203
aVA good reader has an artist's passion,
p204
aVa willingness to get caught up in the story,
p205
aVbut just as importantly, the readers also needs
p206
aVthe coolness of judgment of a scientist,
p207
aVwhich acts to temper and complicate
p208
aVthe reader's intuitive reactions to the story.
p209
aVAs we've seen, the men of the Essex had no trouble with the artistic part.
p210
aVThey dreamed up a variety of horrifying scenarios.
p211
aVThe problem was that they listened to the wrong story.
p212
aVOf all the narratives their fears wrote,
p213
aVthey responded only to the most lurid, the most vivid,
p214
aVthe one that was easiest for their imaginations to picture:
p215
aVcannibals.
p216
aVBut perhaps if they'd been able to read their fears
p217
aVmore like a scientist, with more coolness of judgment,
p218
aVthey would have listened instead to the less violent
p219
aVbut the more likely tale, the story of starvation,
p220
aVand headed for Tahiti, just as Melville's sad commentary suggests.
p221
aa(lp222
VAnd maybe if we all tried to read our fears,
p223
aVwe too would be less often swayed
p224
aVby the most salacious among them.
p225
aVMaybe then we'd spend less time worrying about
p226
aVserial killers and plane crashes,
p227
aVand more time concerned with the subtler
p228
aVand slower disasters we face:
p229
aVthe silent buildup of plaque in our arteries,
p230
aVthe gradual changes in our climate.
p231
aVJust as the most nuanced stories in literature are often the richest,
p232
aVso too might our subtlest fears be the truest.
p233
aVRead in the right way, our fears are an amazing gift
p234
aVof the imagination, a kind of everyday clairvoyance,
p235
aVa way of glimpsing what might be the future
p236
aVwhen there's still time to influence how that future will play out.
p237
aVProperly read, our fears can offer us something as precious
p238
aVas our favorite works of literature:
p239
aVa little wisdom, a bit of insight
p240
aVand a version of that most elusive thing \u2014
p241
aVthe truth.
p242
aVThank you. (Applause)
