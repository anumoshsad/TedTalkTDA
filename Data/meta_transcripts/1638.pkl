VSo a friend of mine who's a political scientist,
p4
aVhe told me several months ago
p5
aVexactly what this month would be like.
p6
aVHe said, you know, there's this fiscal cliff coming,
p7
aVit's going to come at the beginning of 2013.
p8
aVBoth parties absolutely need to resolve it,
p9
aVbut neither party wants to be seen as the first to resolve it.
p10
aVNeither party has any incentive to solve it a second before it's due,
p11
aVso he said, December, you're just going to see lots of
p12
aVangry negotiations, negotiations breaking apart,
p13
aVreports of phone calls that aren't going well,
p14
aVpeople saying nothing's happening at all,
p15
aVand then sometime around Christmas or New Year's,
p16
aVwe're going to hear, "Okay, they resolved everything."
p17
aVHe told me that a few months ago. He said he's 98 percent positive they're going to resolve it,
p18
aVand I got an email from him today saying, all right,
p19
aVwe're basically on track, but now I'm 80 percent positive
p20
aVthat they're going to resolve it.
p21
aa(lp22
VAnd it made me think. I love studying
p23
aVthese moments in American history
p24
aVwhen there was this frenzy of partisan anger,
p25
aVthat the economy was on the verge of total collapse.
p26
aa(lp27
VThe most famous early battle was Alexander Hamilton
p28
aVand Thomas Jefferson over what the dollar would be
p29
aVand how it would be backed up, with Alexander Hamilton
p30
aVsaying, "We need a central bank, the First Bank of the United States,
p31
aVor else the dollar will have no value.
p32
aVThis economy won't work,"
p33
aVand Thomas Jefferson saying, "The people won't trust that.
p34
aVThey just fought off a king. They're not going to accept some central authority."
p35
aVThis battle defined the first 150 years of the U.S. economy,
p36
aVand at every moment, different partisans saying,
p37
aV"Oh my God, the economy's about to collapse,"
p38
aVand the rest of us just going about, spending our bucks
p39
aVon whatever it is we wanted to buy.
p40
aa(lp41
VTo give you a quick primer on where we are,
p42
aVa quick refresher on where we are.
p43
aVSo the fiscal cliff, I was told
p44
aVthat that's too partisan a thing to say,
p45
aValthough I can't remember which party it's supporting or attacking.
p46
aVPeople say we should call it the fiscal slope,
p47
aVor we should call it an austerity crisis,
p48
aVbut then other people say, no, that's even more partisan.
p49
aVSo I just call it the self-imposed, self-destructive
p50
aVarbitrary deadline about resolving an inevitable problem.
p51
aVAnd this is what the inevitable problem looks like.
p52
aVSo this is a projection of U.S. debt as a percentage
p53
aVof our overall economy, of GDP.
p54
aVThe light blue dotted line represents
p55
aVthe Congressional Budget Office's best guess
p56
aVof what will happen if Congress really doesn't do anything,
p57
aVand as you can see, sometime around 2027,
p58
aVwe reach Greek levels of debt,
p59
aVsomewhere around 130 percent of GDP,
p60
aVwhich tells you that some time in the next 20 years,
p61
aVif Congress does absolutely nothing,
p62
aVwe're going to hit a moment where the world's investors,
p63
aVthe world's bond buyers, are going to say,
p64
aV"We don't trust America anymore. We're not going to lend them any money,
p65
aVexcept at really high interest rates."
p66
aVAnd at that moment our economy collapses.
p67
aVBut remember, Greece is there today.
p68
aVWe're there in 20 years. We have lots and lots of time
p69
aVto avoid that crisis,
p70
aVand the fiscal cliff was just one more attempt
p71
aVat trying to force the two sides to resolve the crisis.
p72
aa(lp73
VHere's another way to look at exactly the same problem.
p74
aVThe dark blue line is how much the government spends.
p75
aVThe light blue line is how much the government gets in.
p76
aVAnd as you can see, for most of recent history,
p77
aVexcept for a brief period, we have consistently spent
p78
aVmore than we take in. Thus the national debt.
p79
aVBut as you can also see, projected going forward,
p80
aVthe gap widens a bit and raises a bit,
p81
aVand this graph is only through 2021.
p82
aVIt gets really, really ugly out towards 2030.
p83
aa(lp84
VAnd this graph sort of sums up what the problem is.
p85
aVThe Democrats, they say, well, this isn't a big deal.
p86
aVWe can just raise taxes a bit and close that gap,
p87
aVespecially if we raise taxes on the rich.
p88
aVThe Republicans say, hey, no, no, we've got a better idea.
p89
aVWhy don't we lower both lines?
p90
aVWhy don't we lower government spending and lower government taxes,
p91
aVand then we'll be on an even more favorable
p92
aVlong-term deficit trajectory?
p93
aVAnd behind this powerful disagreement between
p94
aVhow to close that gap,
p95
aVthere's the worst kind of cynical party politics,
p96
aVthe worst kind of insider baseball, lobbying, all of that stuff,
p97
aVbut there's also this powerfully interesting,
p98
aVrespectful disagreement between
p99
aVtwo fundamentally different economic philosophies.
p100
aa(lp101
VAnd I like to think, when I picture how Republicans
p102
aVsee the economy, what I picture is just some amazingly
p103
aVwell-engineered machine, some perfect machine.
p104
aVUnfortunately, I picture it made in Germany or Japan,
p105
aVbut this amazing machine that's constantly scouring
p106
aVevery bit of human endeavor and taking resources,
p107
aVmoney, labor, capital, machinery,
p108
aVaway from the least productive parts and towards the more productive parts,
p109
aVand while this might cause temporary dislocation,
p110
aVwhat it does is it builds up the more productive areas
p111
aVand lets the less productive areas fade away and die,
p112
aVand as a result the whole system is so much more efficient,
p113
aVso much richer for everybody.
p114
aVAnd this view generally believes that there is a role for government,
p115
aVa small role, to set the rules so people aren't lying
p116
aVand cheating and hurting each other,
p117
aVmaybe, you know, have a police force and a fire department
p118
aVand an army, but to have a very limited reach
p119
aVinto the mechanisms of this machinery.
p120
aa(lp121
VAnd when I picture how Democrats and Democratic-leaning
p122
aVeconomists picture this economy,
p123
aVmost Democratic economists are, you know, they're capitalists,
p124
aVthey believe, yes, that's a good system a lot of the time.
p125
aVIt's good to let markets move resources to their more productive use.
p126
aVBut that system has tons of problems.
p127
aVWealth piles up in the wrong places.
p128
aVWealth is ripped away from people who shouldn't be called unproductive.
p129
aVThat's not going to create an equitable, fair society.
p130
aVThat machine doesn't care about the environment,
p131
aVabout racism, about all these issues
p132
aVthat make this life worse for all of us,
p133
aVand so the government does have a role to take resources
p134
aVfrom more productive uses, or from richer sources,
p135
aVand give them to other sources.
p136
aVAnd when you think about the economy through these two different lenses,
p137
aVyou understand why this crisis is so hard to solve,
p138
aVbecause the worse the crisis gets, the higher the stakes are,
p139
aVthe more each side thinks they know the answer
p140
aVand the other side is just going to ruin everything.
p141
aa(lp142
VAnd I can get really despairing. I've spent a lot
p143
aVof the last few years really depressed about this,
p144
aVuntil this year, I learned something that
p145
aVI felt really excited about. I feel like it's really good news,
p146
aVand it's so shocking, I don't like saying it, because I think
p147
aVpeople won't believe me.
p148
aVBut here's what I learned.
p149
aVThe American people, taken as a whole,
p150
aVwhen it comes to these issues, to fiscal issues,
p151
aVare moderate, pragmatic centrists.
p152
aVAnd I know that's hard to believe, that the American people
p153
aVare moderate, pragmatic centrists.
p154
aVBut let me explain what I'm thinking.
p155
aa(lp156
VWhen you look at how the federal government spends money,
p157
aVso this is the battle right here,
p158
aV55 percent, more than half, is on Social Security,
p159
aVMedicare, Medicaid, a few other health programs,
p160
aV20 percent defense, 19 percent discretionary,
p161
aVand six percent interest.
p162
aVSo when we're talking about cutting government spending,
p163
aVthis is the pie we're talking about,
p164
aVand Americans overwhelmingly, and it doesn't matter
p165
aVwhat party they're in, overwhelmingly like
p166
aVthat big 55 percent chunk.
p167
aVThey like Social Security. They like Medicare.
p168
aVThey even like Medicaid, even though that goes to the poor and indigent,
p169
aVwhich you might think would have less support.
p170
aVAnd they do not want it fundamentally touched,
p171
aValthough the American people are remarkably comfortable,
p172
aVand Democrats roughly equal to Republicans,
p173
aVwith some minor tweaks to make the system more stable.
p174
aa(lp175
VSocial Security is fairly easy to fix.
p176
aVThe rumors of its demise are always greatly exaggerated.
p177
aVSo gradually raise Social Security retirement age,
p178
aVmaybe only on people not yet born.
p179
aVAmericans are about 50/50,
p180
aVwhether they're Democrats or Republicans.
p181
aa(lp182
VReduce Medicare for very wealthy seniors,
p183
aVseniors who make a lot of money. Don't even eliminate it. Just reduce it.
p184
aVPeople generally are comfortable with it, Democrats and Republicans.
p185
aa(lp186
VRaise medical health care contributions?
p187
aVEveryone hates that equally, but Republicans
p188
aVand Democrats hate that together.
p189
aa(lp190
VAnd so what this tells me is, when you look at
p191
aVthe discussion of how to resolve our fiscal problems,
p192
aVwe are not a nation that's powerfully divided on the major, major issue.
p193
aVWe're comfortable with it needing some tweaks, but we want to keep it.
p194
aVWe're not open to a discussion of eliminating it.
p195
aa(lp196
VNow there is one issue that is hyper-partisan,
p197
aVand where there is one party that is just spend, spend, spend,
p198
aVwe don't care, spend some more,
p199
aVand that of course is Republicans
p200
aVwhen it comes to military defense spending.
p201
aVThey way outweigh Democrats.
p202
aVThe vast majority want to protect military defense spending.
p203
aVThat's 20 percent of the budget,
p204
aVand that presents a more difficult issue.
p205
aVI should also note that the [discretionary] spending,
p206
aVwhich is about 19 percent of the budget,
p207
aVthat is Democratic and Republican issues,
p208
aVso you do have welfare, food stamps, other programs
p209
aVthat tend to be popular among Democrats,
p210
aVbut you also have the farm bill and all sorts of Department of Interior
p211
aVinducements for oil drilling and other things,
p212
aVwhich tend to be popular among Republicans.
p213
aa(lp214
VNow when it comes to taxes, there is more disagreement.
p215
aVThat's a more partisan area.
p216
aVYou have Democrats overwhelmingly supportive
p217
aVof raising the income tax on people who make 250,000 dollars a year,
p218
aVRepublicans sort of against it, although if you break it out by income,
p219
aVRepublicans who make less than 75,000 dollars a year like this idea.
p220
aVSo basically Republicans who make more than 250,000 dollars a year don't want to be taxed.
p221
aVRaising taxes on investment income, you also see
p222
aVabout two thirds of Democrats but only one third of Republicans
p223
aVare comfortable with that idea.
p224
aa(lp225
VThis brings up a really important point, which is that
p226
aVwe tend in this country to talk about Democrats
p227
aVand Republicans and think there's this little group
p228
aVover there called independents that's, what, two percent?
p229
aVIf you add Democrats, you add Republicans,
p230
aVyou've got the American people.
p231
aVBut that is not the case at all.
p232
aVAnd it has not been the case for most of modern American history.
p233
aVRoughly a third of Americans say that they are Democrats.
p234
aVAround a quarter say that they are Republicans.
p235
aVA tiny little sliver call themselves libertarians, or socialists,
p236
aVor some other small third party,
p237
aVand the largest block, 40 percent, say they're independents.
p238
aVSo most Americans are not partisan,
p239
aVand most of the people in the independent camp
p240
aVfall somewhere in between, so even though we have
p241
aVtremendous overlap between the views on these fiscal issues
p242
aVof Democrats and Republicans,
p243
aVwe have even more overlap when you add in the independents.
p244
aVNow we get to fight about all sorts of other issues.
p245
aVWe get to hate each other on gun control
p246
aVand abortion and the environment,
p247
aVbut on these fiscal issues, these important fiscal issues,
p248
aVwe just are not anywhere nearly as divided as people say.
p249
aa(lp250
VAnd in fact, there's this other group of people
p251
aVwho are not as divided as people might think,
p252
aVand that group is economists.
p253
aVI talk to a lot of economists, and back in the '70s
p254
aVand '80s it was ugly being an economist.
p255
aVYou were in what they called the saltwater camp,
p256
aVmeaning Harvard, Princeton, MIT, Stanford, Berkeley,
p257
aVor you were in the freshwater camp, University of Chicago,
p258
aVUniversity of Rochester.
p259
aVYou were a free market capitalist economist
p260
aVor you were a Keynesian liberal economist,
p261
aVand these people didn't go to each other's weddings,
p262
aVthey snubbed each other at conferences.
p263
aVIt's still ugly to this day, but in my experience,
p264
aVit is really, really hard to find an economist under 40
p265
aVwho still has that kind of way of seeing the world.
p266
aVThe vast majority of economists \u2014 it is so uncool
p267
aVto call yourself an ideologue of either camp.
p268
aVThe phrase that you want, if you're a graduate student
p269
aVor a postdoc or you're a professor,
p270
aVa 38-year-old economics professor, is, "I'm an empiricist.
p271
aVI go by the data."
p272
aVAnd the data is very clear.
p273
aVNone of these major theories have been completely successful.
p274
aVThe 20th century, the last hundred years,
p275
aVis riddled with disastrous examples
p276
aVof times that one school or the other tried to explain
p277
aVthe past or predict the future
p278
aVand just did an awful, awful job,
p279
aVso the economics profession has acquired some degree of modesty.
p280
aVThey still are an awfully arrogant group of people, I will assure you,
p281
aVbut they're now arrogant about their impartiality,
p282
aVand they, too, see a tremendous range of potential outcomes.
p283
aa(lp284
VAnd this nonpartisanship is something that exists,
p285
aVthat has existed in secret
p286
aVin America for years and years and years.
p287
aVI've spent a lot of the fall talking to the three major
p288
aVorganizations that survey American political attitudes:
p289
aVPew Research,
p290
aVthe University of Chicago's National Opinion Research Center,
p291
aVand the most important but the least known
p292
aVis the American National Election Studies group
p293
aVthat is the world's longest, most respected poll of political attitudes.
p294
aVThey've been doing it since 1948,
p295
aVand what they show consistently throughout
p296
aVis that it's almost impossible to find Americans
p297
aVwho are consistent ideologically,
p298
aVwho consistently support, "No we mustn't tax,
p299
aVand we must limit the size of government,"
p300
aVor, "No, we must encourage government to play a larger role
p301
aVin redistribution and correcting the ills of capitalism."
p302
aVThose groups are very, very small.
p303
aVThe vast majority of people, they pick and choose,
p304
aVthey see compromise and they change over time
p305
aVwhen they hear a better argument or a worse argument.
p306
aVAnd that part of it has not changed.
p307
aVWhat has changed is how people respond to vague questions.
p308
aVIf you ask people vague questions, like,
p309
aV"Do you think there should be more government or less government?"
p310
aV"Do you think government should" \u2014 especially if you use loaded language \u2014
p311
aV"Do you think the government should provide handouts?"
p312
aVOr, "Do you think the government should redistribute?"
p313
aVThen you can see radical partisan change.
p314
aVBut when you get specific, when you actually ask
p315
aVabout the actual taxing and spending issues under consideration,
p316
aVpeople are remarkably centrist,
p317
aVthey're remarkably open to compromise.
p318
aa(lp319
VSo what we have, then, when you think about the fiscal cliff,
p320
aVdon't think of it as the American people fundamentally
p321
aVcan't stand each other on these issues
p322
aVand that we must be ripped apart
p323
aVinto two separate warring nations.
p324
aVThink of it as a tiny, tiny number of ancient economists
p325
aVand misrepresentative ideologues have captured the process.
p326
aVAnd they've captured the process through familiar ways,
p327
aVthrough a primary system which encourages
p328
aVthat small group of people's voices,
p329
aVbecause that small group of people,
p330
aVthe people who answer all yeses or all noes
p331
aVon those ideological questions,
p332
aVthey might be small but every one of them has a blog,
p333
aVevery one of them has been on Fox or MSNBC in the last week.
p334
aVEvery one of them becomes a louder and louder voice,
p335
aVbut they don't represent us.
p336
aVThey don't represent what our views are.
p337
aa(lp338
VAnd that gets me back to the dollar,
p339
aVand it gets me back to reminding myself that
p340
aVwe know this experience.
p341
aVWe know what it's like
p342
aVto have these people on TV, in Congress,
p343
aVyelling about how the end of the world is coming
p344
aVif we don't adopt their view completely,
p345
aVbecause it's happened about the dollar
p346
aVever since there's been a dollar.
p347
aVWe had the battle between Jefferson and Hamilton.
p348
aVIn 1913, we had this ugly battle over the Federal Reserve,
p349
aVwhen it was created, with vicious, angry arguments
p350
aVover how it would be constituted,
p351
aVand a general agreement that the way it was constituted
p352
aVwas the worst possible compromise,
p353
aVa compromise guaranteed to destroy this valuable thing,
p354
aVthis dollar, but then everyone agreeing, okay,
p355
aVso long as we're on the gold standard, it should be okay.
p356
aVThe Fed can't mess it up so badly.
p357
aVBut then we got off the gold standard for individuals
p358
aVduring the Depression and we got off the gold standard
p359
aVas a source of international currency coordination
p360
aVduring Richard Nixon's presidency.
p361
aVEach of those times, we were on the verge of complete collapse.
p362
aVAnd nothing happened at all.
p363
aVThroughout it all, the dollar has been
p364
aVone of the most long-standing,
p365
aVstable, reasonable currencies,
p366
aVand we all use it every single day,
p367
aVno matter what the people screaming about tell us,
p368
aVno matter how scared we're supposed to be.
p369
aa(lp370
VAnd this long-term fiscal picture that we're in right now,
p371
aVI think what is most maddening about it is,
p372
aVif Congress were simply able
p373
aVto show not that they agree with each other,
p374
aVnot that they're able to come up with the best possible compromise,
p375
aVbut that they are able to just begin the process
p376
aVtowards compromise, we all instantly are better off.
p377
aVThe fear is that the world is watching.
p378
aVThe fear is that the longer we delay any solution,
p379
aVthe more the world will look to the U.S.
p380
aVnot as the bedrock of stability in the global economy,
p381
aVbut as a place that can't resolve its own fights,
p382
aVand the longer we put that off, the more we make the world nervous,
p383
aVthe higher interest rates are going to be,
p384
aVthe quicker we're going to have to face a day
p385
aVof horrible calamity.
p386
aVAnd so just the act of compromise itself,
p387
aVand sustained, real compromise,
p388
aVwould give us even more time,
p389
aVwould allow both sides even longer to spread out the pain
p390
aVand reach even more compromise down the road.
p391
aa(lp392
VSo I'm in the media. I feel like my job to make this happen
p393
aVis to help foster the things that seem to lead to compromise,
p394
aVto not talk about this in those vague and scary terms
p395
aVthat do polarize us,
p396
aVbut to just talk about it like what it is,
p397
aVnot an existential crisis,
p398
aVnot some battle between two fundamentally different religious views,
p399
aVbut a math problem, a really solvable math problem,
p400
aVone where we're not all going to get what we want
p401
aVand one where, you know, there's going to be a little pain to spread around.
p402
aVBut the more we address it as a practical concern,
p403
aVthe sooner we can resolve it,
p404
aVand the more time we have to resolve it, paradoxically.
p405
aVThank you. (Applause)
