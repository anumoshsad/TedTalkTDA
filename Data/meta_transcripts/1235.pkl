V\u266b I don't understand myself, \u266b
p6
aV\u266b why they keep talking of love, \u266b
p7
aV\u266b if they come near me, \u266b
p8
aV\u266b if they look into my eyes and kiss my hand. \u266b
p9
aV\u266b I don't understand myself, \u266b
p10
aV\u266b why they talk of magic, \u266b
p11
aV\u266b that no one withstands, \u266b
p12
aV\u266b if he sees me, if he passes by. \u266b
p13
aV\u266b But if the red light is on \u266b
p14
aV\u266b in the middle of the night \u266b
p15
aV\u266b and everybody listens to my song, \u266b
p16
aV\u266b then it is plain to see. \u266b
p17
aV\u266b My lips, they give so fiery a kiss, \u266b
p18
aV\u266b my limbs, they are supple and soft. \u266b
p19
aV\u266b It is written for me in the stars, \u266b
p20
aV\u266b thou shalt kiss, thou shalt love. \u266b
p21
aV\u266b My feet, they glide and float, \u266b
p22
aV\u266b my eyes, they lure and glow. \u266b
p23
aV\u266b And I dance as if entranced, 'cause I know, \u266b
p24
aV\u266b my lips give so fiery a kiss. \u266b
p25
aV\u266b In my veins, \u266b
p26
aV\u266b runs a dancer's blood, \u266b
p27
aV\u266b because my beautiful mother \u266b
p28
aV\u266b was the Queen of dance \u266b
p29
aV\u266b in the gilded Alcazar. \u266b
p30
aV\u266b She was so very beautiful, \u266b
p31
aV\u266b I often saw her in my dreams. \u266b
p32
aV\u266b If she beat the tambourine \u266b
p33
aV\u266b to her beguiling dance, all eyes were glowing admiringly. \u266b
p34
aV\u266b She reawakened in me, \u266b
p35
aV\u266b mine is the same lot. \u266b
p36
aV\u266b I dance like her at midnight \u266b
p37
aV\u266b and from deep within I feel: \u266b
p38
aV\u266b My lips, they give so fiery a kiss, \u266b
p39
aV\u266b my limbs, they are supple and soft. \u266b
p40
aV\u266b It is written for me in the stars, \u266b
p41
aV\u266b thou shalt kiss, thou shalt love. \u266b
p42
aV\u266b And I dance as if entranced,  'cause I know, \u266b
p43
aV\u266b my lips give so fiery a kiss. \u266b
