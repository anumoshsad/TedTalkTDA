(lp2
(lp3
VHi everybody. So my name is Mac.
p4
aVMy job is that I lie to children,
p5
aVbut they're honest lies.
p6
aa(lp7
VI write children's books,
p8
aVand there's a quote from Pablo Picasso,
p9
aV"We all know that Art is not truth.
p10
aVArt is a lie that makes us realize truth
p11
aVor at least the truth that is  given us to understand.
p12
aVThe artist must know the manner whereby
p13
aVto convince others of the  truthfulness of his lies."
p14
aa(lp15
VI first heard this when I was a kid,
p16
aVand I loved it,
p17
aVbut I had no idea what it meant.
p18
aV(Laughter)
p19
aa(lp20
VSo I thought, you know what, it's what I'm here
p21
aVto talk to you today about, though,
p22
aVtruth and lies, fiction and reality.
p23
aVSo how could I untangle
p24
aVthis knotted bunch of sentences?
p25
aVAnd I said, I've got PowerPoint. Let's do a Venn diagram.
p26
aV["Truth. Lies."] (Laughter)
p27
aVSo there it is, right there, boom.
p28
aVWe've got truth and lies
p29
aVand then there's this little space,
p30
aVthe edge, in the middle.
p31
aVThat liminal space, that's art.
p32
aVAll right. Venn diagram. (Laughter) (Applause)
p33
aa(lp34
VBut that's actually not very helpful either.
p35
aVThe thing that made me understand
p36
aVthat quote and really kind of what art,
p37
aVat least the art of fiction, was,
p38
aVwas working with kids.
p39
aVI used to be a summer camp counselor.
p40
aVI would do it on my summers off from college,
p41
aVand I loved it.
p42
aVIt was a sports summer camp
p43
aVfor four- to six-year-olds.
p44
aVI was in charge of the four-year-olds,
p45
aVwhich is good, because
p46
aVfour-year-olds can't play  sports, and neither can I.
p47
aV(Laughter)
p48
aVI play sports at a four-year-old level,
p49
aVso what would happen is the kids would
p50
aVdribble around some cones, and then got hot,
p51
aVand then they would go sit underneath the tree
p52
aVwhere I was already sitting \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p53
aVand I would just make up stories and tell them to them
p54
aVand I would tell them stories about my life.
p55
aVI would tell them about how, on the weekends,
p56
aVI would go home and I would spy for the Queen of England.
p57
aVAnd soon, other kids
p58
aVwho weren't even in my group of kids,
p59
aVthey would come up to me, and they would say,
p60
aV"You're Mac Barnett, right?
p61
aVYou're the guy who spies for the Queen of England."
p62
aVAnd I had been waiting my whole life for strangers
p63
aVto come up and ask me that question.
p64
aVIn my fantasy, they were svelte Russian women,
p65
aVbut, you know, four-year-olds \u2014
p66
aVyou take what you can get in Berkeley, California.
p67
aa(lp68
VAnd I realized that the stories that I was telling
p69
aVwere real in this way that was familiar to me
p70
aVand really exciting.
p71
aVI think the pinnacle of this for  me \u2014 I'll never forget this \u2014
p72
aVthere was this little girl  named Riley. She was tiny,
p73
aVand she used to always take  out her lunch every day
p74
aVand she would throw out her fruit.
p75
aVShe would just take her fruit,
p76
aVher mom packed her a melon every day,
p77
aVand she would just throw it in the ivy
p78
aVand then she would eat fruit snacks
p79
aVand pudding cups, and I was like, "Riley,
p80
aVyou can't do that, you  have to eat the fruit."
p81
aVAnd she was like, "Why?"
p82
aVAnd I was like, "Well, when you throw the fruit in the ivy,
p83
aVpretty soon, it's going to be overgrown with melons,"
p84
aVwhich is why I think I ended up
p85
aVtelling stories to children and not being a nutritionist for children.
p86
aVAnd so Riley was like, "That will never happen.
p87
aVThat's not going to happen."
p88
aVAnd so, on the last day of camp,
p89
aVI got up early and I got a big cantaloupe
p90
aVfrom the grocery store
p91
aVand I hid it in the ivy,
p92
aVand then at lunchtime, I was like,
p93
aV"Riley, why don't you go over there and see what you've done."
p94
aVAnd \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p95
aVshe went trudging through  the ivy, and then her eyes
p96
aVjust got so wide, and she pointed out this melon
p97
aVthat was bigger than her head,
p98
aVand then all the kids ran over  there and rushed around her,
p99
aVand one of the kids was like, "Hey,
p100
aVwhy is there a sticker on this?"
p101
aV(Laughter)
p102
aVAnd I was like, "That is also why I say
p103
aVdo not throw your stickers in the ivy.
p104
aVPut them in the trash can. It ruins nature when you do this."
p105
aVAnd Riley carried that melon around with her all day,
p106
aVand she was so proud.
p107
aa(lp108
VAnd Riley knew she didn't  grow a melon in seven days,
p109
aVbut she also knew that she did,
p110
aVand it's a weird place,
p111
aVbut it's not just a place that kids can get to.
p112
aVIt's anything. Art can get us to that place.
p113
aVShe was right in that place in the middle,
p114
aVthat place which you could call art or fiction.
p115
aVI'm going to call it wonder.
p116
aVIt's what Coleridge called the willing suspension of disbelief
p117
aVor poetic faith,
p118
aVfor those moments where a story, no matter how strange,
p119
aVhas some semblance of the truth,
p120
aVand then you're able to believe it.
p121
aVIt's not just kids who can get there.
p122
aVAdults can too, and we get there when we read.
p123
aVIt's why in two days, people will be
p124
aVdescending on Dublin to take the walking tour
p125
aVof Bloomsday and see everything that happened in "Ulysses,"
p126
aVeven though none of that happened.
p127
aVOr people go to London and they visit Baker Street
p128
aVto see Sherlock Holmes' apartment,
p129
aVeven though 221B is just a number that was painted
p130
aVon a building that never  actually had that address.
p131
aVWe know these characters aren't real,
p132
aVbut we have real feelings about them,
p133
aVand we're able to do that.
p134
aVWe know these characters aren't real,
p135
aVand yet we also know that they are.
p136
aa(lp137
VKids can get there a lot more easily than adults can,
p138
aVand that's why I love writing for kids.
p139
aVI think kids are the best audience
p140
aVfor serious literary fiction.
p141
aVWhen I was a kid,
p142
aVI was obsessed with secret door novels,
p143
aVthings like "Narnia,"
p144
aVwhere you would open a wardrobe and go through to a magical land.
p145
aVAnd I was convinced that secret doors really did exist
p146
aVand I would look for them and try to go through them.
p147
aVI wanted to live and cross over into  that fictional world, which is \u2014
p148
aVI would always just open people's closet doors.  (Laughter)
p149
aVI would just go through my mom's boyfriend's closet,
p150
aVand there was not a secret magical land there.
p151
aVThere was some other weird stuff that I think my mom should know about.
p152
aV(Laughter)
p153
aVAnd I was happy to tell her all about it.
p154
aa(lp155
VAfter college, my first job was working
p156
aVbehind one of these secret doors.
p157
aVThis is a place called 826 Valencia.
p158
aVIt's at 826 Valencia Street
p159
aVin the Mission in San Francisco,
p160
aVand when I worked there, there was a publishing company
p161
aVheadquartered there called McSweeney's,
p162
aVa nonprofit writing center called 826 Valencia,
p163
aVbut then the front of it
p164
aVwas a strange shop.
p165
aVYou see, this place was zoned retail,
p166
aVand in San Francisco, they were not going to give us a variance,
p167
aVand so the writer who founded it, a writer named Dave Eggers,
p168
aVto come into compliance  with code, he said, "Fine,
p169
aVI'm just going to build a pirate supply store."
p170
aVAnd that's what he did. (Laughter)
p171
aVAnd it's beautiful. It's all wood.
p172
aVThere's drawers you can pull out and get citrus
p173
aVso you don't get scurvy.
p174
aVThey have eyepatches in lots of colors,
p175
aVbecause when it's springtime, pirates want to go wild.
p176
aVYou don't know. Black is boring. Pastel.
p177
aVOr eyes, also in lots of colors,
p178
aVjust glass eyes, depending on how you want
p179
aVto deal with that situation.
p180
aVAnd the store, strangely,
p181
aVpeople came to them and bought things,
p182
aVand they ended up paying the rent
p183
aVfor our tutoring center, which was behind it,
p184
aVbut to me, more important was the fact
p185
aVthat I think the quality of work you do,
p186
aVkids would come and get instruction in writing,
p187
aVand when you have to walk this weird, liminal, fictional space like this to go do your writing,
p188
aVit's going to affect the kind of work that you make.
p189
aVIt's a secret door that you can walk through.
p190
aa(lp191
VSo I ran the 826 in Los Angeles,
p192
aVand it was my job to build the store down there.
p193
aVSo we have The Echo Park Time Travel Mart.
p194
aVThat's our motto: "Whenever you are, we're already then."
p195
aV(Laughter)
p196
aVAnd it's on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles.
p197
aVOur friendly staff is ready to help you.
p198
aVThey're from all eras,
p199
aVincluding just the 1980s, that guy on the end,
p200
aVhe's from the very recent past.
p201
aVThere's our Employees of the Month,
p202
aVincluding Genghis Khan, Charles Dickens.
p203
aVSome great people have come up through our ranks.
p204
aVThis is our kind of pharmacy section.
p205
aVWe have some patent medicines,
p206
aVCanopic jars for your organs,
p207
aVcommunist soap that says,
p208
aV"This is your soap for the year." (Laughter)
p209
aVOur slushy machine broke
p210
aVon the opening night and  we didn't know what to do.
p211
aVOur architect was covered in red syrup.
p212
aVIt looked like he had just murdered somebody,
p213
aVwhich it was not out of the question
p214
aVfor this particular architect,
p215
aVand we didn't know what to do.
p216
aVIt was going to be the highlight of our store.
p217
aVSo we just put that sign on it that said,
p218
aV"Out of order. Come back yesterday." (Laughter)
p219
aVAnd that ended up being a better joke than slushies,
p220
aVso we just left it there forever.
p221
aVMammoth Chunks. These things weigh, like, seven pounds each.
p222
aVBarbarian repellent. It's full of salad
p223
aVand potpourri \u2014 things that barbarians hate.
p224
aVDead languages.
p225
aV(Laughter)
p226
aVLeeches, nature's tiny doctors.
p227
aVAnd Viking Odorant, which comes in lots of great scents:
p228
aVtoenails, sweat and rotten vegetables, pyre ash.
p229
aVBecause we believe that Axe Body Spray
p230
aVis something that you should only find on the battlefield,
p231
aVnot under your arms. (Laughter)
p232
aVAnd these are robot emotion chips,
p233
aVso robots can feel love or fear.
p234
aVOur biggest seller is Schadenfreude,
p235
aVwhich we did not expect.
p236
aV(Laughter)
p237
aVWe did not think that was going to happen.
p238
aVBut there's a nonprofit behind it,
p239
aVand kids go through a door that says "Employees Only"
p240
aVand they end up in this space
p241
aVwhere they do homework and write stories
p242
aVand make films and this is a book release party
p243
aVwhere kids will read.
p244
aVThere's a quarterly that's published
p245
aVwith just writing that's done by the kids
p246
aVwho come every day after school,
p247
aVand we have release parties
p248
aVand they eat cake and read for their parents
p249
aVand drink milk out of champagne glasses.
p250
aVAnd it's a very special space,
p251
aVbecause it's this weird space in the front.
p252
aVThe joke isn't a joke.
p253
aVYou can't find the seams on the fiction,
p254
aVand I love that. It's this little bit of fiction
p255
aVthat's colonized the real world.
p256
aVI see it as kind of a book in three dimensions.
p257
aa(lp258
VThere's a term called metafiction,
p259
aVand that's just stories about stories,
p260
aVand meta's having a moment now.
p261
aVIts last big moment was probably in the 1960s
p262
aVwith novelists like John Barth and William Gaddis,
p263
aVbut it's been around.
p264
aVIt's almost as old as storytelling itself.
p265
aVAnd one metafictive technique
p266
aVis breaking the fourth wall. Right?
p267
aVIt's when an actor will turn to the audience
p268
aVand say, "I am an actor,
p269
aVthese are just rafters."
p270
aVAnd even that supposedly honest moment,
p271
aVI would argue, is in service of the lie,
p272
aVbut it's supposed to foreground the artificiality
p273
aVof the fiction.
p274
aVFor me, I kind of prefer the opposite.
p275
aVIf I'm going to break down the fourth wall,
p276
aVI want fiction to escape
p277
aVand come into the real world.
p278
aVI want a book to be a secret door that opens
p279
aVand lets the stories out into reality.
p280
aa(lp281
VAnd so I try to do this in my books.
p282
aVAnd here's just one example.
p283
aVThis is the first book that I ever made.
p284
aVIt's called "Billy Twitters and his Blue Whale Problem."
p285
aVAnd it's about a kid who gets a blue whale as a pet
p286
aVbut it's a punishment
p287
aVand it ruins his life.
p288
aVSo it's delivered overnight by FedUp.
p289
aV(Laughter)
p290
aVAnd he has to take it to school with him.
p291
aVHe lives in San Francisco \u2014
p292
aVvery tough city to own a blue whale in.
p293
aVA lot of hills, real estate is at a premium.
p294
aVThis market's crazy, everybody.
p295
aVBut underneath the jacket is this case,
p296
aVand that's the cover underneath the book, the jacket,
p297
aVand there's an ad
p298
aVthat offers a free 30-day risk-free trial
p299
aVfor a blue whale.
p300
aVAnd you can just send in a self-addressed stamped envelope
p301
aVand we'll send you a whale.
p302
aVAnd kids do write in.
p303
aa(lp304
VSo here's a letter. It says, "Dear people,
p305
aVI bet you 10 bucks you won't send me a blue whale.
p306
aVEliot Gannon (age 6)."
p307
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p308
aa(lp309
VSo what Eliot and the other kids
p310
aVwho send these in get back
p311
aVis a letter in very small print from a Norwegian law firm \u2014
p312
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p313
aVthat says that due to a change in customs laws,
p314
aVtheir whale has been held up in Sognefjord,
p315
aVwhich is a very lovely fjord,
p316
aVand then it just kind of talks about Sognefjord
p317
aVand Norwegian food for  a little while. It digresses.
p318
aV(Laughter)
p319
aVBut it finishes off by saying that
p320
aVyour whale would love to hear from you.
p321
aVHe's got a phone number,
p322
aVand you can call and leave him a message.
p323
aVAnd when you call and leave him a message,
p324
aVyou just, on the outgoing message,
p325
aVit's just whale sounds and then a beep,
p326
aVwhich actually sounds a lot like a whale sound.
p327
aVAnd they get a picture of their whale too.
p328
aVSo this is Randolph,
p329
aVand Randolph belongs to a kid named Nico
p330
aVwho was one of the first kids to ever call in,
p331
aVand I'll play you some of Nico's message.
p332
aVThis is the first message I ever got from Nico.
p333
aa(lp334
V(Audio) Nico: Hello, this is Nico.
p335
aVI am your owner, Randolph. Hello.
p336
aVSo this is the first time I can ever talk to you,
p337
aVand I might talk to you soon another day. Bye.
p338
aa(lp339
VMac Barnett: So Nico called back, like, an hour later.
p340
aV(Laughter)
p341
aVAnd here's another one of Nico's messages.
p342
aa(lp343
V(Audio) Nico: Hello, Randolph, this is Nico.
p344
aVI haven't talked to you for a long time,
p345
aVbut I talked to you on Saturday or Sunday,
p346
aVyeah, Saturday or Sunday,
p347
aVso now I'm calling you again
p348
aVto say hello and I wonder what you're doing right now,
p349
aVand I'm going to probably call you again
p350
aVtomorrow or today,
p351
aVso I'll talk to you later. Bye.
p352
aa(lp353
VMB: So he did, he called back that day again.
p354
aVHe's left over 25 messages for Randolph
p355
aVover four years.
p356
aVYou find out all about him
p357
aVand the grandma that he loves
p358
aVand the grandma that  he likes a little bit less \u2014
p359
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p360
aVand the crossword puzzles that he does,
p361
aVand this is \u2014 I'll play you one  more message from Nico.
p362
aVThis is the Christmas message from Nico.
p363
aa(lp364
V[Beep] (Audio) Nico: Hello, Randolph,
p365
aVsorry I haven't talked to you in a long time.
p366
aVIt's just that I've been so busy
p367
aVbecause school started,
p368
aVas you might not know, probably,
p369
aVsince you're a whale, you don't know,
p370
aVand I'm calling you to just say,
p371
aVto wish you a merry Christmas.
p372
aVSo have a nice Christmas,
p373
aVand bye-bye, Randolph. Goodbye.
p374
aVMB: I actually got Nico,
p375
aVI hadn't heard from in 18 months,
p376
aVand he just left a message two days ago.
p377
aVHis voice is completely different,
p378
aVbut he put his babysitter on the phone,
p379
aVand she was very nice to Randolph as well.
p380
aa(lp381
VBut Nico's the best reader I could hope for.
p382
aVI would want anyone I was writing for
p383
aVto be in that place emotionally
p384
aVwith the things that I create.
p385
aVI feel lucky. Kids like Nico are the best readers,
p386
aVand they deserve the best stories we can give them.
p387
aa(lp388
VThank you very much.
