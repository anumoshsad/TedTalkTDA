p4
aa(lp5
VIt's really quite an honor to be here tonight,
p6
aVand I'm really glad that I stayed here and listened
p7
aVbecause I've really been inspired.
p8
aVAnd I'm going to play some songs for you tonight
p9
aVthat are, literally, world premieres.
p10
aVI've been working on my new record
p11
aVand I've never played these songs for anybody
p12
aVexcept the microphone.
p13
aa(lp14
VThis is a song that I wrote
p15
aVabout the meaning of technology,
p16
aVwhich goes perfectly with this gathering.
p17
aVI started thinking about \u2014 when I was in college,
p18
aVespecially as a blind person,
p19
aVdoing a research paper was a major undertaking.
p20
aVYou had to go to the library,
p21
aVsee if you could get them to find the books for you,
p22
aVyou know, footnotes and all that.
p23
aVNow you can just go on Google. Just look it up.
p24
aVI wish I had that when I was in college.
p25
aVAnyway, this is a song about:
p26
aVwe have all this, but what are we going to do with it?
p27
aVIt's called "All the Answers."

p36
aa(lp37
V\u266b Why do memories of you linger \u266b
p38
aa(lp39
V\u266b when I'm trying to reach my goal? \u266b
p40
aa(lp41
V\u266b And why must I move my fingers \u266b
p42
aa(lp43
V\u266b to the music in my soul? \u266b
p44

p70
aa(lp71
V\u266b back in 1964? \u266b
p72
aa(lp73
V\u266b And why did Shakespeare create Iago \u266b
p74
aa(lp75
V\u266b to tear apart a love so pure? \u266b
p76
aa(lp77
V\u266b How can my dreams be so vivid \u266b
p78
aa(lp79
V\u266b in a psychosonic way? \u266b

V(Applause)
p166
aa(lp167
VThank you.
p168
aVWhew! It's a miracle I didn't make any mistakes on that song.
p169
aVThat's the first time I've ever played it.
p170
aV(Applause)
p171
aVIt's a "feel the fear and do it anyway" kind of thing.
p172
aVThis next song is a song
p173
aa(lp174
Vthat started out as a dream \u2014 a childhood dream.
p175
aVIt was one of the titles
p176
aVthat I was sort of thinking about calling my record,
p177
aVexcept there's a couple of problems.
p178
aVOne thing is, it's unpronounceable.
p179
aVAnd it's a made-up word.
p180
aVIt's called "Tembererana."
p181
aVAnd the song is based on
p182
aVwhat I think was my first
p183
aVchildhood attempts
p184
aVto think about invisible forces.
p185
aVSo "tembererana" was these dreams,
p186
aVin which I would be running away
p187
aVfrom bad feelings \u2014 is the only way I can put it.
p188
aVSo this is called "Tembererana."
p189
aVIt's based on an Argentinian rhythm
p190
aVcalled "carnivalito."
p191
aa(lp192
V\u266b A dream within a dream, \u266b
p193
aa(lp194
V\u266b a world within a world, \u266b
p195
aa(lp196
V\u266b the sound of a primal scream \u266b
p197
aa(lp198
V\u266b travels out across the land. \u266b
p199
aa(lp200
V\u266b Images flickering, \u266b
p201
aa(lp202
V\u266b the sound of the war machine, \u266b
p203
aa(lp204
V\u266b a procession of limousines \u266b
p205
aa(lp206
V\u266b travels slowly across the land. \u266b
p207
aa(lp208
V\u266b Another child could use a hand. \u266b
p209
aa(lp210
V\u266b Reaching out from within \u266b
p211
aa(lp212
V\u266b tembererana, hey, tembererana ... \u266b
p213
aa(lp214

p215
aa(lp216
V\u266b The earth is an open tomb. \u266b
p217
aa(lp218
V\u266b The sound of the final boom \u266b
p219
aa(lp220
V\u266b rumbles fiercely across the land. \u266b
p221
aa(lp222
V\u266b Fear, you're the enemy. \u266b
p223
aa(lp224
V\u266b Obliterating all but thee. \u266b
p225
aa(lp226
V\u266b You see what you want to see. \u266b
p227
aa(lp228
V\u266b Before I'm blinded, I will toast \u266b
p229
aa(lp230
V\u266b the shade of power that I love most, \u266b
p231
aa(lp232
V\u266b the power of creation. \u266b
p233
aa(lp234
V\u266b Tembererana, hey, tembererana ... \u266b

p237
aa(lp238
V\u266b Da, da, da, da, da, da, da \u266b
p239
aa(lp240
V\u266b As a child, alone and afraid, \u266b
p241
aa(lp242
V\u266b escaping the impressions every feeling made, \u266b
p243
aa(lp244
V\u266b I would run, run away \u266b
p245
aa(lp246
V\u266b into a world where the good was the aim of the game \u266b
p247
aa(lp248
V\u266b and the sum of invisible power \u266b
p249
aa(lp250
V\u266b had a name. \u266b
p251
aa(lp252
V\u266b It's the same name. \u266b
