VAbout a year and a half ago,
p4
aVStephen Lawler, who also gave a talk
p5
aVhere at TED in 2007 on Virtual Earth,
p6
aVbrought me over to become the architect of Bing Maps,
p7
aVwhich is Microsoft's online-mapping effort.
p8
aVIn the past two and a half, we've been very hard at work
p9
aVon redefining the way maps work online.
p10
aVAnd we really are seeing this in very different terms
p11
aVfrom the kind of mapping and direction site
p12
aVthat one is used to.
p13
aa(lp14
VSo, the first thing that you might notice about the mapping site
p15
aVis just the fluidity of the zooming and the panning,
p16
aVwhich, if you're familiar at all with Seadragon,
p17
aVthat's where it comes from.
p18
aa(lp19
VMapping is, of course,
p20
aVnot just about cartography,
p21
aVit's also about imagery.
p22
aVSo, as we zoom-in beyond a certain level
p23
aVthis resolves into a kind of Sim City-like
p24
aVvirtual view at 45 degrees.
p25
aVThis can be viewed from any of the cardinal directions
p26
aVto show you the 3D structure of the city, all the facades.
p27
aVNow, we see this space, this three-dimensional environment,
p28
aVas being a canvas on which
p29
aVall sorts of applications can play out,
p30
aVand map's directions are really just one of them.
p31
aa(lp32
VIf you click on this, you'll see
p33
aVsome of the ones that we've put out, just in the past couple of months
p34
aVsince we've launched.
p35
aVSo, for example, a couple of days after the disaster in Haiti,
p36
aVwe had an earthquake map that showed
p37
aVbefore and after pictures from the sky.
p38
aVThis wonderful one which I don't have time to show you
p39
aVis taking hyper-local blogs in real time
p40
aVand mapping those stories, those entries
p41
aVto the places that are referred to on the blogs.
p42
aVIt's wonderful.
p43
aa(lp44
VBut I'm going to show you some more candy sort of stuff.
p45
aa(lp46
VSo, we see the imagery, of course,
p47
aVnot stopping at the sky.
p48
aVThese little green bubbles represent
p49
aVphotosynths that users have made.
p50
aVI'm not going to dive into them either, but photosynths are integrated into the map.
p51
aVEverything that's cased in blue
p52
aVis an area where we've taken imagery on the ground as well.
p53
aa(lp54
VAnd so, when you fly down \u2014
p55
aa(lp56
V(Applause)
p57
aa(lp58
VThank you. When you fly down to the ground,
p59
aVand you see this kind of panoramic imagery,
p60
aVthe first thing that you might notice is that it's not just a picture,
p61
aVthere's just as much three-dimensional understanding of this environment
p62
aVas there is of the three-dimensional city from above,
p63
aVso if I click on something to get a closer view of it,
p64
aVthen, the fact that that transition looks as it does,
p65
aVis a function of all of that geometry,
p66
aVall of that 3D understanding behind this model.
p67
aa(lp68
VNow, I'll show you a fun app
p69
aVthat \u2014 we've been working on a collaboration with our friends at Flickr.
p70
aVThis takes Flickr, georegistered imagery
p71
aVand uses photosynth-like processes
p72
aVto connect that imagery to our imagery, so \u2014
p73
aVI'm not sure if that's the one I actually meant to pull up, but \u2014
p74
aa(lp75
V(Laughter)
p76
aa(lp77
VBut notice \u2014 this is, of course, a popular tourist site,
p78
aVand there are lots of photos around here,
p79
aVand these photos are all taken at different times.
p80
aVSo this one was taken around five.
p81
aVSo that's the Flickr photo,
p82
aVthat's our imagery.
p83
aVSo you really see how this kind of crowd-sourced imagery
p84
aVis integrating, in a very deep way, into the map itself.
p85
aa(lp86
V(Applause)
p87
aa(lp88
VThank you.
p89
aa(lp90
V(Applause)
p91
aa(lp92
VThere are several reasons why this is interesting
p93
aVand one of them, of course, is time travel.
p94
aVAnd I'm not going to show you some of the wonderful historic imagery in here,
p95
aVbut there are some with horses and carriages and so on as well.
p96
aVBut what's cool about this is that, not only is it augmenting
p97
aVthis visual representation of the world
p98
aVwith things that are coming in from users,
p99
aVbut it also is the foundation for augmented reality,
p100
aVand that's something that I'll be showing you more of in just a moment.
p101
aa(lp102
VNow I just made a transition indoors. That's also interesting.
p103
aVOK, notice there's now a roof above us.
p104
aVWe're inside the Pike Place Market.
p105
aVAnd this is something that we're able to do with a backpack camera,
p106
aVso, we're now not only imaging in the street
p107
aVwith this camera on tops of cars,
p108
aVbut we're also imaging inside.
p109
aVAnd from here, we're able to do the same sorts of registration,
p110
aVnot only of still images, but also of video.
p111
aa(lp112
VSo this is something that we're now going to try
p113
aVfor the first time, live,
p114
aVand this is really, truly, very frightening.
p115
aa(lp116
V(Laughter)
p117
aa(lp118
VOK.
p119
aa(lp120
V(Ringing)
p121
aa(lp122
VAll right, guys, are you there?
p123
aa(lp124
V(Noise)
p125
aa(lp126
VAll right. I'm hitting it. I'm punching play.
p127
aVI'm live. All right. There we go.
p128
aVSo, these are our friends in Pike Place Market, the lab.
p129
aa(lp130
V(Applause)
p131
aa(lp132
VSo they're broadcasting this live.
p133
aVOK, George, can you pan back over to the corner market?
p134
aVBecause I want to show points of interest.
p135
aVNo, no. The other way.
p136
aVYeah, yeah, back to the corner, back to the corner.
p137
aVI don't want to see you guys yet.
p138
aVOK, OK, back to the corner, back to the corner, back to the corner.
p139
aVOK, never mind.
p140
aa(lp141
VWhat I wanted to show you was these points of interest
p142
aVover here on top of the image
p143
aVbecause what that gives you a sense of is the way,
p144
aVif you're actually on the spot,
p145
aVyou can think about this \u2014
p146
aVthis is taking a step in addition to augmented reality.
p147
aa(lp148
VWhat the hell are you guys \u2014 oh, sorry.
p149
aa(lp150
V(Laughter)
p151
aa(lp152
VWe're doing two different \u2014
p153
aVOK, I'm hanging up now.
p154
aVWe're doing two different things here.
p155
aVOne of them is to take that real ...
p156
aa(lp157
V(Laughter)
p158
aa(lp159
VAll right, let me just take a moment and thank the team.
p160
aVThey've done a fantastic job of pulling this together.
p161
aa(lp162
V(Applause)
p163
aa(lp164
VI'm going to abandon them now and walk back outside.
p165
aVAnd while I walk outside, I'll just mention that
p166
aVhere we're using this for telepresence,
p167
aVbut you can equally well use this
p168
aVon the spot, for augmented reality.
p169
aVWhen you use it on the spot, it means that
p170
aVyou're able to bring all of that metadata
p171
aVand information about the world to you.
p172
aVSo here, we're taking the extra step of also broadcasting it.
p173
aVThat was being broadcast, by the way, on a 4G network
p174
aVfrom the market.
p175
aa(lp176
VAll right, and now there's one last TED talk
p177
aVthat Microsoft has given in the past several years.
p178
aVAnd that's Curtis Wong, WorldWide Telescope.
p179
aVSo, we're going to head over to the dumpsters,
p180
aVwhere it's traditional, after a long day at the market,
p181
aVto go out for a break, but also stare up at the sky.
p182
aVThis is the integration
p183
aVof WorldWide Telescope into our maps.
p184
aa(lp185
V(Applause)
p186
aa(lp187
VThis is the current \u2014 thank you \u2014
p188
aVthis is the current time. If we scrub the time,
p189
aVthen we can see how the sky will look at different times,
p190
aVand we can get all of this very detailed
p191
aVinformation about different times, different dates:
p192
aVLet's move the moon a little higher in the sky,
p193
aVmaybe change the date.
p194
aVI would like to kind of zoom in on the moon.
p195
aVSo, this is an astronomically complete
p196
aVrepresentation of the sky
p197
aVintegrated right into the Earth.
p198
aa(lp199
VAll right now, I've overrun my time,
p200
aVso I've got to stop.
p201
aVThank you all very much.
