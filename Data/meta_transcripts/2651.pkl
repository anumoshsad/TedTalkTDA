VSo what if I could make for you
p4
aVa designer baby?
p5
aVWhat if you as a parent-to-be
p6
aVand I as a scientist decided to go down that road together?
p7
aa(lp8
VWhat if we didn't?
p9
aVWhat if we thought, "That's a bad idea,"
p10
aVbut many of our family, friends and coworkers
p11
aVdid make that decision?
p12
aa(lp13
VLet's fast-forward just 15 years from now.
p14
aVLet's pretend it's the year 2030,
p15
aVand you're a parent.
p16
aVYou have your daughter, Marianne, next to you,
p17
aVand in 2030, she is what we call a natural
p18
aVbecause she has no genetic modifications.
p19
aVAnd because you and your partner consciously made that decision,
p20
aVmany in your social circle, they kind of look down on you.
p21
aVThey think you're, like, a Luddite or a technophobe.
p22
aa(lp23
VMarianne's best friend Jenna, who lives right next door,
p24
aVis a very different story.
p25
aVShe was born a genetically modified designer baby with numerous upgrades.
p26
aVYeah. Upgrades.
p27
aVAnd these enhancements were introduced
p28
aVusing a new genetic modification technology
p29
aVthat goes by the funny name CRISPR,
p30
aVyou know, like something's crisp,
p31
aVthis is CRISPR.
p32
aVThe scientist that Jenna's parents hired to do this
p33
aVfor several million dollars
p34
aVintroduced CRISPR into a whole panel of human embryos.
p35
aVAnd then they used genetic testing,
p36
aVand they predicted that that little tiny embryo, Jenna's embryo,
p37
aVwould be the best of the bunch.
p38
aVAnd now, Jenna is an actual, real person.
p39
aVShe's sitting on the carpet in your living room
p40
aVplaying with your daughter Marianne.
p41
aVAnd your families have known each other for years now,
p42
aVand it's become very clear to you
p43
aVthat Jenna is extraordinary.
p44
aVShe's incredibly intelligent.
p45
aVIf you're honest with yourself, she's smarter than you,
p46
aVand she's five years old.
p47
aVShe's beautiful, tall, athletic,
p48
aVand the list goes on and on.
p49
aVAnd in fact, there's a whole new generation
p50
aVof these GM kids like Jenna.
p51
aVAnd so far it looks like
p52
aVthey're healthier than their parents' generation,
p53
aVthan your generation.
p54
aVAnd they have lower health care costs.
p55
aVThey're immune to a host of health conditions,
p56
aVincluding HIV/AIDS and genetic diseases.
p57
aa(lp58
VIt all sounds so great,
p59
aVbut you can't help but have this sort of unsettling feeling,
p60
aVa gut feeling, that there's something just not quite right about Jenna,
p61
aVand you've had the same feeling about other GM kids that you've met.
p62
aVYou were also reading in the newspaper earlier this week
p63
aVthat a study of these children who were born as designer babies
p64
aVindicates they may have some issues,
p65
aVlike increased aggressiveness and narcissism.
p66
aVBut more immediately on your mind
p67
aVis some news that you just got from Jenna's family.
p68
aVShe's so smart,
p69
aVshe's now going to be going to a special school,
p70
aVa different school than your daughter Marianne,
p71
aVand this is kind of throwing your family into a disarray.
p72
aVMarianne's been crying,
p73
aVand last night when you took her to bed to kiss her goodnight,
p74
aVshe said, "Daddy, will Jenna even be my friend anymore?"
p75
aa(lp76
VSo now, as I've been telling you this imagined 2030 story,
p77
aVI have a feeling that I may have put some of you
p78
aVinto this sci-fi frame of reference. Right?
p79
aVYou think you're reading a sci-fi book.
p80
aVOr maybe, like, in Halloween mode of thinking.
p81
aVBut this is really a possible reality for us,
p82
aVjust 15 years from now.
p83
aa(lp84
VI'm a stem cell and genetics researcher
p85
aVand I can see this new CRISPR technology
p86
aVand its potential impact.
p87
aVAnd we may find ourselves in that reality,
p88
aVand a lot will depend on what we decide to do today.
p89
aVAnd if you're still kind of thinking in sci-fi mode,
p90
aVconsider that the world of science had a huge shock earlier this year,
p91
aVand the public largely doesn't even know about it.
p92
aVResearchers in China just a few months ago
p93
aVreported the creation of genetically modified human embryos.
p94
aVThis was the first time in history.
p95
aVAnd they did it using this new CRISPR technology.
p96
aVIt didn't work perfectly,
p97
aVbut I still think they sort of cracked the door ajar
p98
aVon a Pandora's box here.
p99
aVAnd I think some people are going to run with this technology
p100
aVand try to make designer babies.
p101
aa(lp102
VNow, before I go on, some of you may hold up your hands and say,
p103
aV"Stop, Paul, wait a minute.
p104
aVWouldn't that be illegal?
p105
aVYou can't just go off and create a designer baby."
p106
aVAnd in fact, to some extent, you're right.
p107
aVIn some countries, you couldn't do that.
p108
aVBut in many other countries, including my country, the US,
p109
aVthere's actually no law on this, so in theory, you could do it.
p110
aVAnd there was another development this year that resonates in this area,
p111
aVand that happened not so far from here over in the UK.
p112
aVAnd the UK traditionally has been the strictest country
p113
aVwhen it comes to human genetic modification.
p114
aVIt was illegal there,
p115
aVbut just a few months ago,
p116
aVthey carved out an exception to that rule.
p117
aVThey passed a new law
p118
aVallowing the creation of genetically modified humans
p119
aVwith the noble goal of trying to prevent a rare kind of genetic disease.
p120
aVBut still I think in combination these events are pushing us
p121
aVfurther towards an acceptance
p122
aVof human genetic modification.
p123
aa(lp124
VSo I've been talking about this CRISPR technology.
p125
aVWhat actually is CRISPR?
p126
aVSo if you think about the GMOs that we're all more familiar with,
p127
aVlike GMO tomatoes and wheat
p128
aVand things like that,
p129
aVthis technology is similar to the technologies
p130
aVthat were used to make those,
p131
aVbut it's dramatically better,
p132
aVcheaper and faster.
p133
aa(lp134
VSo what is it?
p135
aVIt's actually like a genetic Swiss army knife.
p136
aVWe can pretend this is a Swiss army knife
p137
aVwith different tools in it,
p138
aVand one of the tools is kind of like a magnifying glass
p139
aVor a GPS for our DNA,
p140
aVso it can home in on a certain spot.
p141
aVAnd the next tool is like scissors
p142
aVthat can cut the DNA right in that spot.
p143
aVAnd finally we have a pen
p144
aVwhere we can literally rewrite the genetic code in that location.
p145
aVIt's really that simple.
p146
aa(lp147
VAnd this technology, which came on the scene just three years ago,
p148
aVhas taken science by storm.
p149
aVIt's evolving so fast, and it's so freaking exciting to scientists,
p150
aVand I admit I'm fascinated by it and we use it in my own lab,
p151
aVthat I think someone is going to go that extra step
p152
aVand continue the GM human embryo work
p153
aVand maybe make designer babies.
p154
aVThis is so ubiquitous now.
p155
aVIt just came on the scene three years ago.
p156
aVThousands of labs literally have this in hand today,
p157
aVand they're doing important research.
p158
aVMost of them are not interested in designer babies.
p159
aVThey're studying human disease
p160
aVand other important elements of science.
p161
aVSo there's a lot of good research going on with CRISPR.
p162
aVAnd the fact that we can now do genetic modifications
p163
aVthat used to take years and cost millions of dollars
p164
aVin a few weeks for a couple thousand bucks,
p165
aVto me as a scientist that's fantastic,
p166
aVbut again, at the same time,
p167
aVit opens the door to people going too far.
p168
aVAnd I think for some people
p169
aVthe focus is not going to be so much on science.
p170
aVThat's not what's going to be driving them.
p171
aVIt's going to be ideology or the chase for a profit.
p172
aVAnd they're going to go for designer babies.
p173
aa(lp174
VSo why should we be concerned about this?
p175
aVWe know from Darwin, if we go back two centuries,
p176
aVthat evolution and genetics profoundly have impacted humanity,
p177
aVwho we are today.
p178
aVAnd some think there's like a social Darwinism at work in our world,
p179
aVand maybe even a eugenics as well.
p180
aVImagine those trends, those forces,
p181
aVwith a booster rocket of this CRISPR technology
p182
aVthat is so powerful and so ubiquitous.
p183
aVAnd in fact, we can just go back one century to the last century
p184
aVto see the power that eugenics can have.
p185
aa(lp186
VSo my father, Peter Knoepfler,
p187
aVwas actually born right here in Vienna.
p188
aVHe was Viennese, and he was born here in 1929.
p189
aVAnd when my grandparents had little baby Peter,
p190
aVthe world was very different. Right?
p191
aVIt was a different Vienna.
p192
aVThe United States was different.
p193
aVThe world was different.
p194
aVThere was a eugenics rising,
p195
aVand my grandparents realized,
p196
aVpretty quickly I think,
p197
aVthat they were on the wrong side of the eugenics equation.
p198
aVAnd so despite this being their home
p199
aVand their whole extended family's home,
p200
aVand this area being their family's home for generations,
p201
aVthey decided because of eugenics
p202
aVthat they had to leave.
p203
aVAnd they survived, but they were heartbroken,
p204
aVand I'm not sure my dad ever really got over leaving Vienna.
p205
aVHe left when he was just eight years old
p206
aVin 1938.
p207
aa(lp208
VSo today, I see a new eugenics
p209
aVkind of bubbling to the surface.
p210
aVIt's supposed to be a kinder, gentler, positive eugenics,
p211
aVdifferent than all that past stuff.
p212
aVBut I think even though it's focused on trying to improve people,
p213
aVit could have negative consequences,
p214
aVand it really worries me
p215
aVthat some of the top proponents of this new eugenics,
p216
aVthey think CRISPR is the ticket to make it happen.
p217
aa(lp218
VSo I have to admit, you know,
p219
aVeugenics, we talk about making better people.
p220
aVIt's a tough question.
p221
aVWhat is better when we're talking about a human being?
p222
aVBut I admit I think maybe a lot of us
p223
aVcould agree that human beings,
p224
aVmaybe we could use a little betterment.
p225
aVLook at our politicians
p226
aVhere, you know, back in the US \u2014
p227
aVGod forbid we go there right now.
p228
aVMaybe even if we just look in the mirror,
p229
aVthere might be ways we think we could be better.
p230
aVI might wish, honestly, that I had more hair here, instead of baldness.
p231
aVSome people might wish they were taller,
p232
aVhave a different weight, a different face.
p233
aVIf we could do those things, we could make those things happen,
p234
aVor we could make them happen in our children,
p235
aVit would be very seductive.
p236
aVAnd yet coming with it would be these risks.
p237
aVI talked about eugenics,
p238
aVbut there would be risks to individuals as well.
p239
aVSo if we forget about enhancing people
p240
aVand we just try to make them healthier using genetic modification,
p241
aVthis technology is so new
p242
aVand so powerful,
p243
aVthat by accident we could make them sicker.
p244
aVThat easily could happen.
p245
aVAnd there's another risk,
p246
aVand that is that all of the legitimate, important genetic modification research
p247
aVgoing on just in the lab \u2014
p248
aVagain, no interest in designer babies \u2014
p249
aVa few people going the designer baby route,
p250
aVthings go badly,
p251
aVthat entire field could be damaged.
p252
aa(lp253
VI also think it's not that unlikely
p254
aVthat governments might start taking an interest in genetic modification.
p255
aVSo for example our imagined GM Jenna child
p256
aVwho is healthier,
p257
aVif there's a generation that looks like they have lower health care costs,
p258
aVit's possible that governments may start trying to compel their citizens
p259
aVto go the GM route.
p260
aVLook at China's one-child policy.
p261
aVIt's thought that that prevented the birth of 400 million human beings.
p262
aVSo it's not beyond the realm of possible
p263
aVthat genetic modification could be something that governments push.
p264
aVAnd if designer babies become popular,
p265
aVin our digital age \u2014
p266
aVviral videos, social media \u2014
p267
aVwhat if designer babies are thought to be fashionable,
p268
aVand they kind of become the new glitterati,
p269
aVthe new Kardashians or something?
p270
aa(lp271
V(Laughter)
p272
aa(lp273
VYou know, are those trends that we really could control?
p274
aVI'm not convinced that we could.
p275
aa(lp276
VSo again, today it's Halloween
p277
aVand when we talk about genetic modification,
p278
aVthere's one Halloween-associated character
p279
aVthat is talked about or invoked more than anything else,
p280
aVand that is Frankenstein.
p281
aVMostly that's been Frankenfoods and all this other stuff.
p282
aVBut if we think about this now and we think about it in the human context
p283
aVon a day like Halloween,
p284
aVif parents can in essence costume their children genetically,
p285
aVare we going to be talking about a Frankenstein 2.0 kind of situation?
p286
aVI don't think so. I don't think it's going to get to that extreme.
p287
aVBut when we are going about hacking the human code,
p288
aVI think all bets are off in terms of what might come of that.
p289
aVThere would still be dangers.
p290
aVAnd we can look in the past
p291
aVto other elements of transformative science
p292
aVand see how they can basically go out of control
p293
aVand permeate society.
p294
aa(lp295
VSo I'll just give you one example, and that is in vitro fertilization.
p296
aVAlmost exactly 40 years ago,
p297
aVtest tube baby number one Louise Brown was born,
p298
aVand that's a great thing,
p299
aVand I think since then five million IVF babies have been born,
p300
aVbringing immeasurable happiness.
p301
aVA lot of parents now can love those kids.
p302
aVBut if you think about it, in four decades,
p303
aVfive million babies being born from a new technology
p304
aVis pretty remarkable,
p305
aVand the same kind of thing could happen
p306
aVwith human genetic modification and designer babies.
p307
aVSo depending on the decisions we make in the next few months,
p308
aVthe next year or so,
p309
aVif designer baby number one is born,
p310
aVwithin a few decades,
p311
aVthere could well be millions of genetically modified humans.
p312
aVAnd there's a difference there too, because if we, you in the audience, or I,
p313
aVif we decide to have a designer baby,
p314
aVthen their children will also be genetically modified, and so on,
p315
aVbecause it's heritable.
p316
aVSo that's a big difference.
p317
aa(lp318
VSo with all of this in mind,
p319
aVwhat should we do?
p320
aVThere's actually going to be a meeting
p321
aVa month from tomorrow in Washington, D.C.
p322
aVby the US National Academy of Sciences
p323
aVto tackle that exact question.
p324
aVWhat is the right path forward with human genetic modification?
p325
aVI believe at this time
p326
aVwe need a moratorium.
p327
aVWe have to ban this.
p328
aVWe should not allow creating genetically modified people,
p329
aVbecause it's just too dangerous and too unpredictable.
p330
aVBut there's a lot of people \u2014
p331
aa(lp332
V(Applause)
p333
aa(lp334
VThanks.
p335
aa(lp336
V(Applause)
p337
aa(lp338
VAnd let me say, just as a scientist,
p339
aVit's a little bit scary for me to say that in public,
p340
aVbecause science generally doesn't like self-regulation and things like that.
p341
aVSo I think we need to put a hold on this,
p342
aVbut there are many people who not only disagree with me,
p343
aVthey feel the exact opposite.
p344
aVThey're like, step on the gas, full speed ahead,
p345
aVlet's make designer babies.
p346
aVAnd so in the meeting in December
p347
aVand other meetings that are likely to follow in the next few months,
p348
aVit's very possible there may be no moratorium.
p349
aVAnd I think part of the problem that we have
p350
aVis that all of this trend,
p351
aVthis revolution in genetic modification applying to humans,
p352
aVthe public hasn't known about it.
p353
aVNobody has been saying,
p354
aVlook, this is a big deal, this is a revolution,
p355
aVand this could affect you in very personal ways.
p356
aVAnd so part of my goal is actually to change that
p357
aVand to educate and engage with the public
p358
aVand get you guys talking about this.
p359
aVAnd so I hope at these meetings that there will be a role for the public
p360
aVto bring their voice to bear as well.
p361
aa(lp362
VSo if we kind of circle back now to 2030 again, that imagined story,
p363
aVand depending on the decisions we make, again, today \u2014
p364
aVliterally we don't have a lot of time \u2014
p365
aVin the next few months, the next year or so,
p366
aVbecause this technology is spreading like wildfire.
p367
aVLet's pretend we're back in that reality.
p368
aVWe're at a park,
p369
aVand our kid is swinging on the swing.
p370
aVIs that kid a regular old kid,
p371
aVor did we decide to have a designer baby?
p372
aVAnd let's say we went the sort of traditional route,
p373
aVand there's our kid swinging on the swing,
p374
aVand frankly, they're kind of a mess.
p375
aVTheir hair is all over the place like mine.
p376
aVThey have a stuffy nose.
p377
aVThey're not the best student in the world.
p378
aVThey're adorable, you love them,
p379
aVbut there on the swing next to them,
p380
aVtheir best friend is a GM kid,
p381
aVand the two of them are kind of swinging like this,
p382
aVand you can't help but compare them, right?
p383
aVAnd the GM kid is swinging higher,
p384
aVthey look better, they're a better student,
p385
aVthey don't have that stuffy nose you need to wipe.
p386
aVHow is that going to make you feel
p387
aVand what decision might you make next time?
p388
aa(lp389
