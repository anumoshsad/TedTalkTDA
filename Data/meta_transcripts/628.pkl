VMost of the time, art and science stare at each other
p4
aVacross a gulf of mutual incomprehension.
p5
aVThere is great confusion when the two look at each other.
p6
aVArt, of course, looks at the world through the psyche,
p7
aVthe emotions \u2014 the unconscious at times \u2014 and of course the aesthetic.
p8
aVScience tends to look at the world through the rational, the quantitative \u2014
p9
aVthings that can be measured and described \u2014
p10
aVbut it gives art a terrific context of understanding.
p11
aa(lp12
VIn the Extreme Ice Survey,
p13
aVwe're dedicated to bringing those two parts of human understanding together,
p14
aVto merging the art and science
p15
aVto the end of helping us understand nature
p16
aVand humanity's relationship with nature better.
p17
aVSpecifically, I as a person
p18
aVwho's been a professional nature photographer my whole adult life,
p19
aVam firmly of the belief that photography, video, film
p20
aVhave tremendous powers for helping us understand
p21
aVand shape the way we think about nature
p22
aVand about ourselves in relationship to nature.
p23
aa(lp24
VIn this project, we're specifically interested, of course, in ice.
p25
aVI'm fascinated by the beauty of it, the mutability of it,
p26
aVthe malleability of it,
p27
aVand the fabulous shapes in which it can carve itself.
p28
aVThese first images are from Greenland.
p29
aVBut ice has another meaning.
p30
aVIce is the canary in the global coal mine.
p31
aVIt's the place where we can see and touch and hear and feel climate change in action.
p32
aa(lp33
VClimate change is a really abstract thing in most of the world.
p34
aVWhether or not you believe in it is based on your sense of
p35
aVis it raining more or is it raining less?
p36
aVIs it getting hotter or is it getting colder?
p37
aVWhat do the computer models say about this, that and the other thing?
p38
aVAll of that, strip it away. In the world of the arctic and alpine environments,
p39
aVwhere the ice is, it's real and it's present.
p40
aVThe changes are happening. They're very visible.
p41
aVThey're photographable. They're measurable.
p42
aa(lp43
V95 percent of the glaciers in the world are retreating or shrinking.
p44
aVThat's outside Antarctica.
p45
aV95 percent of the glaciers in the world are retreating or shrinking,
p46
aVand that's because the precipitation patterns and the temperature patterns are changing.
p47
aVThere is no significant scientific dispute about that.
p48
aVIt's been observed, it's measured, it's bomb-proof information.
p49
aVAnd the great irony and tragedy of our time
p50
aVis that a lot of the general public thinks that science is still arguing about that.
p51
aVScience is not arguing about that.
p52
aVIn these images we see ice from enormous glaciers,
p53
aVice sheets that are hundreds of thousands of years old
p54
aVbreaking up into chunks, and chunk by chunk by chunk,
p55
aViceberg by iceberg, turning into global sea level rise.
p56
aa(lp57
VSo, having seen all of this in the course of a 30-year career,
p58
aVI was still a skeptic about climate change until about 10 years ago,
p59
aVbecause I thought the story of climate change was based on computer models.
p60
aVI hadn't realized it was based on concrete measurements
p61
aVof what the paleoclimates \u2014 the ancient climates \u2014 were,
p62
aVas recorded in the ice sheets, as recorded in deep ocean sediments,
p63
aVas recorded in lake sediments, tree rings,
p64
aVand a lot of other ways of measuring temperature.
p65
aa(lp66
VWhen I realized that climate change was real, and it was not based on computer models,
p67
aVI decided that one day I would do a project
p68
aVlooking at trying to manifest climate change photographically.
p69
aVAnd that led me to this project.
p70
aVInitially, I was working on a National Geographic assignment \u2014
p71
aVconventional, single frame, still photography.
p72
aVAnd one crazy day, I got the idea that I should \u2014
p73
aVafter that assignment was finished \u2014
p74
aVI got the idea that I should shoot in time-lapse photography,
p75
aVthat I should station a camera or two at a glacier
p76
aVand let it shoot every 15 minutes, or every hour or whatever
p77
aVand watch the progression of the landscape over time.
p78
aa(lp79
VWell, within about three weeks,
p80
aVI incautiously turned that idea of a couple of time-lapse cameras
p81
aVinto 25 time-lapse cameras.
p82
aVAnd the next six months of my life were the hardest time in my career,
p83
aVtrying to design, build and deploy out in the field these 25 time-lapse cameras.
p84
aVThey are powered by the sun. Solar panels power them.
p85
aVPower goes into a battery. There is a custom made computer
p86
aVthat tells the camera when to fire.
p87
aVAnd these cameras are positioned on rocks on the sides of the glaciers,
p88
aVand they look in on the glacier from permanent, bedrock positions,
p89
aVand they watch the evolution of the landscape.
p90
aVWe just had a number of cameras out on the Greenland Ice Sheet.
p91
aVWe actually drilled holes into the ice, way deep down below the thawing level,
p92
aVand had some cameras out there for the past month and a half or so.
p93
aVActually, there's still a camera out there right now.
p94
aVIn any case, the cameras shoot roughly every hour.
p95
aVSome of them shoot every half hour, every 15 minutes, every five minutes.
p96
aa(lp97
VHere's a time lapse of one of the time-lapse units being made.
p98
aV(Laughter)
p99
aVI personally obsessed about every nut, bolt and washer in these crazy things.
p100
aVI spent half my life at our local hardware store
p101
aVduring the months when we built these units originally.
p102
aa(lp103
VWe're working in most of the major glaciated regions of the northern hemisphere.
p104
aVOur time-lapse units are in Alaska, the Rockies, Greenland and Iceland,
p105
aVand we have repeat photography positions,
p106
aVthat is places we just visit on an annual basis,
p107
aVin British Columbia, the Alps and Bolivia.
p108
aa(lp109
VIt's a big undertaking. I stand here before you tonight
p110
aVas an ambassador for my whole team.
p111
aVThere's a lot of people working on this right now.
p112
aVWe've got 33 cameras out this moment.
p113
aVWe just had 33 cameras shoot about half an hour ago
p114
aVall across the northern hemisphere, watching what's happened.
p115
aVAnd we've spent a lot of time in the field. It's been a fantastic amount of work.
p116
aVWe've been out for two and a half years,
p117
aVand we've got about another two and a half years yet to go.
p118
aa(lp119
VThat's only half our job.
p120
aVThe other half of our job is to tell the story to the global public.
p121
aVYou know, scientists have collected this kind of information
p122
aVoff and on over the years, but a lot of it stays within the science community.
p123
aVSimilarly, a lot of art projects stay in the art community,
p124
aVand I feel very much a responsibility through mechanisms like TED,
p125
aVand like our relationship with the Obama White House,
p126
aVwith the Senate, with John Kerry, to influence policy
p127
aVas much as possible with these pictures as well.
p128
aVWe've done films. We've done books. We have more coming.
p129
aVWe have a site on Google Earth
p130
aVthat Google Earth was generous enough to give us,
p131
aVand so forth, because we feel very much the need to tell this story,
p132
aVbecause it is such an immediate evidence of ongoing climate change right now.
p133
aa(lp134
VNow, one bit of science before we get into the visuals.
p135
aVIf everybody in the developed world understood this graph,
p136
aVand emblazoned it on the inside of their foreheads,
p137
aVthere would be no further societal argument about climate change
p138
aVbecause this is the story that counts.
p139
aVEverything else you hear is just propaganda and confusion.
p140
aVKey issues: this is a 400,000 year record.
p141
aVThis exact same pattern is seen going back now
p142
aValmost a million years before our current time.
p143
aVAnd several things are important.
p144
aa(lp145
VNumber one: temperature and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
p146
aVgo up and down basically in sync.
p147
aVYou can see that from the orange line and the blue line.
p148
aVNature naturally has allowed carbon dioxide to go up to 280 parts per million.
p149
aVThat's the natural cycle.
p150
aVGoes up to 280 and then drops
p151
aVfor various reasons that aren't important to discuss right here.
p152
aVBut 280 is the peak.
p153
aVRight now, if you look at the top right part of that graph,
p154
aVwe're at 385 parts per million.
p155
aVWe are way, way outside the normal, natural variability.
p156
aVEarth is having a fever.
p157
aVIn the past hundred years, the temperature of the Earth
p158
aVhas gone up 1.3 degrees Fahrenheit, .75 degrees Celsius,
p159
aVand it's going to keep going up
p160
aVbecause we keep dumping fossil fuels into the atmosphere.
p161
aVAt the rate of about two and a half parts per million per year.
p162
aVIt's been a remorseless, steady increase.
p163
aa(lp164
VWe have to turn that around.
p165
aVThat's the crux, and someday I hope to emblazon that
p166
aVacross Times Square in New York and a lot of other places.
p167
aVBut anyway, off to the world of ice.
p168
aa(lp169
VWe're now at the Columbia Glacier in Alaska.
p170
aVThis is a view of what's called the calving face.
p171
aVThis is what one of our cameras saw over the course of a few months.
p172
aVYou see the glacier flowing in from the right,
p173
aVdropping off into the sea, camera shooting every hour.
p174
aVIf you look in the middle background,
p175
aVyou can see the calving face bobbing up and down like a yo-yo.
p176
aVThat means that glacier's floating and it's unstable,
p177
aVand you're about to see the consequences of that floating.
p178
aVTo give you a little bit of a sense of scale,
p179
aVthat calving face in this picture
p180
aVis about 325 feet tall. That's 32 stories.
p181
aVThis is not a little cliff. This is like a major office building in an urban center.
p182
aVThe calving face is the wall where the visible ice breaks off,
p183
aVbut in fact, it goes down below sea level another couple thousand feet.
p184
aVSo there's a wall of ice a couple thousand feet deep
p185
aVgoing down to bedrock if the glacier's grounded on bedrock,
p186
aVand floating if it isn't.
p187
aa(lp188
VHere's what Columbia's done. This is in south central Alaska.
p189
aVThis was an aerial picture I did one day in June three years ago.
p190
aVThis is an aerial picture we did this year.
p191
aVThat's the retreat of this glacier.
p192
aVThe main stem, the main flow of the glacier is coming from the right
p193
aVand it's going very rapidly up that stem.
p194
aVWe're going to be up there in just a few more weeks,
p195
aVand we expect that it's probably retreated another half a mile,
p196
aVbut if I got there and discovered that it had collapsed
p197
aVand it was five miles further back, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised.
p198
aa(lp199
VNow it's really hard to grasp the scale of these places,
p200
aVbecause as the glaciers \u2014
p201
aVone of the things is that places like Alaska and Greenland are huge,
p202
aVthey're not normal landscapes \u2014
p203
aVbut as the glaciers are retreating, they're also deflating,
p204
aVlike air is being let out of a balloon.
p205
aVAnd so, there are features on this landscape.
p206
aVThere's a ridge right in the middle of the picture, up above where that arrow comes in,
p207
aVthat shows you that a little bit.
p208
aVThere's a marker line called the trim line
p209
aVabove our little red illustration there.
p210
aVThis is something no self-respecting photographer would ever do \u2014
p211
aVyou put some cheesy illustration on your shot, right? \u2014
p212
aVand yet you have to do it sometimes to narrate these points.
p213
aVBut, in any case, the deflation of this glacier since 1984
p214
aVhas been higher than the Eiffel Tower, higher than the Empire State Building.
p215
aa(lp216
VA tremendous amount of ice has been let out of these valleys
p217
aVas it's retreated and deflated, gone back up valley.
p218
aVThese changes in the alpine world are accelerating.
p219
aVIt's not static.
p220
aVParticularly in the world of sea ice,
p221
aVthe rate of natural change is outstripping predictions of just a few years ago,
p222
aVand the processes either are accelerating
p223
aVor the predictions were too low to begin with.
p224
aVBut in any case, there are big, big changes happening as we speak.
p225
aa(lp226
VSo, here's another time-lapse shot of Columbia.
p227
aVAnd you see where it ended in these various spring days,
p228
aVJune, May, then October.
p229
aVNow we turn on our time lapse.
p230
aVThis camera was shooting every hour.
p231
aVGeologic process in action here.
p232
aVAnd everybody says, well don't they advance in the winter time?
p233
aVNo. It was retreating through the winter because it's an unhealthy glacier.
p234
aVFinally catches up to itself, it advances.
p235
aa(lp236
VAnd you can look at these pictures over and over again
p237
aVbecause there's such a strange, bizarre fascination in seeing
p238
aVthese things you don't normally get to see come alive.
p239
aVWe've been talking about "seeing is believing "
p240
aVand seeing the unseen at TED Global.
p241
aVThat's what you see with these cameras.
p242
aVThe images make the invisible visible.
p243
aVThese huge crevasses open up.
p244
aVThese great ice islands break off \u2014
p245
aVand now watch this.
p246
aVThis has been the springtime this year \u2014
p247
aVa huge collapse. That happened in about a month,
p248
aVthe loss of all that ice.
p249
aa(lp250
VSo that's where we started three years ago,
p251
aVway out on the left, and that's where we were a few months ago, the
p252
aVlast time we went into Columbia.
p253
aVTo give you a feeling for the scale of the retreat,
p254
aVwe did another cheesy illustration,
p255
aVwith British double-decker buses.
p256
aVIf you line up 295 of those nose to tail, that's about how far back that was.
p257
aVIt's a long way.
p258
aa(lp259
VOn up to Iceland.
p260
aVOne of my favorite glaciers, the Sólheimajökull.
p261
aVAnd here, if you watch, you can see the terminus retreating.
p262
aVYou can see this river being formed.
p263
aVYou can see it deflating.
p264
aVWithout the photographic process, you would never see this. This is invisible.
p265
aVYou can stand up there your whole life and you would never see this,
p266
aVbut the camera records it.
p267
aa(lp268
VSo we wind time backwards now.
p269
aVWe go back a couple years in time.
p270
aVThat's where it started.
p271
aVThat's where it ended a few months ago.
p272
aa(lp273
VAnd on up to Greenland.
p274
aVThe smaller the ice mass, the faster it responds to climate.
p275
aVGreenland took a little while to start reacting
p276
aVto the warming climate of the past century,
p277
aVbut it really started galloping along about 20 years ago.
p278
aVAnd there's been a tremendous increase in the temperature up there.
p279
aa(lp280
VIt's a big place. That's all ice.
p281
aVAll those colors are ice and it goes up to about two miles thick,
p282
aVjust a gigantic dome that comes in from the coast and rises in the middle.
p283
aVThe one glacier up in Greenland
p284
aVthat puts more ice into the global ocean
p285
aVthan all the other glaciers in the northern hemisphere combined
p286
aVis the Ilulissat Glacier.
p287
aa(lp288
VWe have some cameras on the south edge of the Ilulissat,
p289
aVwatching the calving face as it goes through this dramatic retreat.
p290
aVHere's a two-year record of what that looks like.
p291
aVHelicopter in front of the calving face for scale, quickly dwarfed.
p292
aVThe calving face is four and a half miles across,
p293
aVand in this shot, as we pull back, you're only seeing about a mile and a half.
p294
aVSo, imagine how big this is
p295
aVand how much ice is charging out.
p296
aVThe interior of Greenland is to the right.
p297
aVIt's flowing out to the Atlantic Ocean on the left.
p298
aVIcebergs, many, many, many, many times the size of this building, are roaring out to sea.
p299
aa(lp300
VWe just downloaded these pictures a couple weeks ago,
p301
aVas you can see. June 25th,
p302
aVmonster calving events happened.
p303
aVI'll show you one of those in a second.
p304
aa(lp305
VThis glacier has doubled its flow speed in the past 15 years.
p306
aVIt now goes at 125 feet a day, dumping all this ice into the ocean.
p307
aVIt tends to go in these pulses, about every three days,
p308
aVbut on average, 125 feet a day,
p309
aVtwice the rate it did 20 years ago.
p310
aa(lp311
VOkay. We had a team out watching this glacier,
p312
aVand we recorded the biggest calving event that's ever been put on film.
p313
aVWe had nine cameras going.
p314
aVThis is what a couple of the cameras saw.
p315
aVA 400-foot-tall calving face breaking off.
p316
aVHuge icebergs rolling over.
p317
aVOkay, how big was that? It's hard to get it.
p318
aVSo an illustration again, gives you a feeling for scale.
p319
aVA mile of retreat in 75 minutes
p320
aVacross the calving face, in that particular event, three miles wide.
p321
aVThe block was three-fifths of a mile deep,
p322
aVand if you compare the expanse of the calving face
p323
aVto the Tower Bridge in London, about 20 bridges wide.
p324
aVOr if you take an American reference, to the U.S. Capitol Building
p325
aVand you pack 3,000 Capitol Buildings into that block,
p326
aVit would be equivalent to how large that block was.
p327
aV75 minutes.
p328
aa(lp329
VNow I've come to the conclusion
p330
aVafter spending a lot of time in this climate change world
p331
aVthat we don't have a problem of economics, technology and public policy.
p332
aVWe have a problem of perception.
p333
aVThe policy and the economics and the technology are serious enough issues,
p334
aVbut we actually can deal with them.
p335
aVI'm certain that we can.
p336
aVBut what we have is a perception problem
p337
aVbecause not enough people really get it yet.
p338
aVYou're an elite audience. You get it.
p339
aVFortunately, a lot of the political leaders in the major countries of the world
p340
aVare an elite audience that for the most part gets it now.
p341
aVBut we still need to bring a lot of people along with us.
p342
aVAnd that's where I think organizations like TED,
p343
aVlike the Extreme Ice Survey can have a terrific impact
p344
aVon human perception and bring us along.
p345
aVBecause I believe we have an opportunity right now.
p346
aa(lp347
VWe are nearly on the edge of a crisis,
p348
aVbut we still have an opportunity to face the greatest challenge
p349
aVof our generation and, in fact, of our century.
p350
aVThis is a terrific, terrific call to arms
p351
aVto do the right thing for ourselves and for the future.
p352
aVI hope that we have the wisdom to let the angels of our better nature
p353
aVrise to the occasion and do what needs to be done. Thank you.
