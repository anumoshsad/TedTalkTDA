VNow, since this is TEDGlobal,
p4
aVwho can tell me what this is called in French?
p5
aVI see you're all up on the history of hurdy-gurdy \u2014
p6
aV"vielle à roue."
p7
aVAnd in Spanish, "zanfona."
p8
aVAnd in Italian, "ghironda," okay?
p9
aVHurdy-gurdy, or wheel fiddle.
p10
aa(lp11
VSo, these are the different kinds and shapes of the hurdy-gurdy.
p12
aVThe hurdy-gurdy is the only musical instrument
p13
aVthat uses a crank to turn a wheel
p14
aVto rub strings, like the bow of a violin,
p15
aVto produce music.
p16
aVIt has three different kinds of strings.
p17
aVThe first string is the drone string,
p18
aVwhich plays a continuous sound like the bagpipe.
p19
aVThe second string is a melody string,
p20
aVwhich is played with a wooden keyboard tuned like a piano.
p21
aVAnd the third string is pretty innovative.
p22
aVIt's also the only instrument
p23
aVthat uses this kind of technique.
p24
aVIt activates what's called the buzzing bridge, or the dog.
p25
aVWhen I turn the crank and I apply pressure,
p26
aVit makes a sound like a barking dog.
p27
aVSo all of this is pretty innovative,
p28
aVif you consider
p29
aVthat the hurdy-gurdy appeared about a thousand years ago
p30
aVand it took two people to play it;
p31
aVone to turn the crank,
p32
aVand another person \u2014 yes \u2014 to play the melody
p33
aVby physically pulling up large wooden pegs.
p34
aVLuckily, all of this changed a couple of centuries later.
p35
aVSo, one person could actually play
p36
aVand almost \u2014 this is pretty heavy \u2014
p37
aVcarry the hurdy-gurdy.
p38
aa(lp39
VThe hurdy-gurdy has been used, historically, through the centuries
p40
aVin mostly dance music
p41
aVbecause of the uniqueness of the melody
p42
aVcombined with the acoustic boombox here.
p43
aVAnd today, the hurdy-gurdy is used in all sorts of music \u2014
p44
aVtraditional folk music,
p45
aVdance, contemporary
p46
aVand world music \u2014
p47
aVin the U.K., in France, in Spain
p48
aVand in Italy.
p49
aVAnd this kind of hurdy-gurdy takes anywhere from three to five years [to order and receive it].
p50
aVIt's made by specialized luthiers,
p51
aValso in Europe.
p52
aVAnd it's very difficult to tune.
p53
