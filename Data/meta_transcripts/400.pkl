VMy name is Ursus Wehrli, and I would like to talk to you this morning
p4
aVabout my project, Tidying Up Art.
p5
aVFirst of all \u2014 any questions so far?
p6
aVFirst of all, I have to say I'm not from around here.
p7
aVI'm from a completely different cultural area, maybe you noticed?
p8
aVI mean, I'm wearing a tie, first. And then secondly, I'm a little bit nervous
p9
aVbecause I'm speaking in a foreign language,
p10
aVand I want to apologize in advance, for any mistakes I might make.
p11
aVBecause I'm from Switzerland, and I just don't hope you think this is Swiss German
p12
aVI'm speaking now here. This is just what it sounds like
p13
aVif we Swiss try to speak American.
p14
aVBut don't worry \u2014 I don't have trouble with English, as such.
p15
aVI mean, it's not my problem, it's your language after all.
p16
aV(Laughter)
p17
aVI am fine. After this presentation here at TED, I can simply go back to Switzerland,
p18
aVand you have to go on talking like this all the time.
p19
aV(Laughter)
p20
aa(lp21
VSo I've been asked by the organizers to read from my book.
p22
aVIt's called "Tidying Up Art" and it's, as you can see,
p23
aVit's more or less a picture book.
p24
aVSo the reading would be over very quickly.
p25
aVBut since I'm here at TED, I decided to hold my talk here in a more modern way,
p26
aVin the spirit of TED here, and I managed to do some slides here for you.
p27
aVI'd like to show them around so we can just, you know \u2014
p28
aV(Laughter)
p29
aVActually, I managed to prepare for you some enlarged pictures \u2014 even better.
p30
aa(lp31
VSo Tidying Up Art, I mean, I have to say, that's a relatively new term.
p32
aVYou won't be familiar with it.
p33
aVI mean, it's a hobby of mine that I've been indulging in for the last few years,
p34
aVand it all started out with this picture of the American artist, Donald Baechler
p35
aVI had hanging at home. I had to look at it every day
p36
aVand after a while I just couldn't stand the mess anymore
p37
aVthis guy was looking at all day long.
p38
aVYeah, I kind of felt sorry for him.
p39
aVAnd it seemed to me even he felt really bad
p40
aVfacing these unorganized red squares day after day.
p41
aVSo I decided to give him a little support,
p42
aVand brought some order into neatly stacking the blocks on top of each other.
p43
aV(Laughter)
p44
aVYeah. And I think he looks now less miserable.
p45
aVAnd it was great. With this experience, I started to look more closely
p46
aVat modern art. Then I realized how, you know, the world of modern art
p47
aVis particularly topsy-turvy.
p48
aa(lp49
VAnd I can show here a very good example.
p50
aVIt's actually a simple one, but it's a good one to start with.
p51
aVIt's a picture by Paul Klee.
p52
aVAnd we can see here very clearly, it's a confusion of color.
p53
aV(Laughter)
p54
aVYeah. The artist doesn't really seem to know where to put the different colors.
p55
aVThe various pictures here of the various elements of the picture \u2014
p56
aVthe whole thing is unstructured.
p57
aVWe don't know, maybe Mr. Klee was probably in a hurry, I mean \u2014
p58
aV(Laughter)
p59
aV\u2014 maybe he had to catch a plane, or something.
p60
aVWe can see here he started out with orange,
p61
aVand then he already ran out of orange,
p62
aVand here we can see he decided to take a break for a square.
p63
aVAnd I would like to show you here my tidied up version of this picture.
p64
aV(Laughter)
p65
aVWe can see now what was barely recognizable in the original:
p66
aV17 red and orange squares are juxtaposed with just two green squares.
p67
aVYeah, that's great.
p68
aVSo I mean, that's just tidying up for beginners.
p69
aVI would like to show you here a picture which is a bit more advanced.
p70
aV(Laughter)
p71
aa(lp72
VWhat can you say? What a mess.
p73
aVI mean, you see, everything seems to have been scattered aimlessly around the space.
p74
aVIf my room back home had looked like this,
p75
aVmy mother would have grounded me for three days.
p76
aVSo I'd like to \u2014 I wanted to reintroduce some structure into that picture.
p77
aVAnd that's really advanced tidying up.
p78
aV(Applause)
p79
aVYeah, you're right. Sometimes people clap at this point,
p80
aVbut that's actually more in Switzerland.
p81
aV(Laughter)
p82
aVWe Swiss are famous for chocolate and cheese. Our trains run on time.
p83
aVWe are only happy when things are in order.
p84
aa(lp85
VBut to go on, here is a very good example to see.
p86
aVThis is a picture by Joan Miro.
p87
aVAnd yeah, we can see the artist has drawn a few lines and shapes
p88
aVand dropped them any old way onto a yellow background.
p89
aVAnd yeah, it's the sort of thing you produce when you're doodling on the phone.
p90
aV(Laughter)
p91
aVAnd this is my \u2014
p92
aV(Laughter)
p93
aV\u2014 you can see now the whole thing takes up far less space.
p94
aVIt's more economical and also more efficient.
p95
aVWith this method Mr. Miro could have saved canvas for another picture.
p96
aa(lp97
VBut I can see in your faces that you're still a little bit skeptical.
p98
aVSo that you can just appreciate how serious I am about all this,
p99
aVI brought along the patents, the specifications for some of these works,
p100
aVbecause I've had my working methods patented
p101
aVat the Eidgenössische Amt für Geistiges Eigentum in Bern, Switzerland.
p102
aV(Laughter)
p103
aVI'll just quote from the specification.
p104
aV"Laut den Kunstprüfer Dr. Albrecht \u2014"
p105
aVIt's not finished yet.
p106
aV"Laut den Kunstprüfer Dr. Albrecht Götz von Ohlenhusen
p107
aVwird die Verfahrensweise rechtlich geschützt welche die Kunst
p108
aVdurch spezifisch aufgeräumte Regelmässigkeiten
p109
aVdes allgemeinen Formenschatzes
p110
aVneue Wirkungen zu erzielen möglich wird."
p111
aa(lp112
VJa, well I could have translated that, but you would have been none the wiser.
p113
aVI'm not sure myself what it means but it sounds good anyway.
p114
aVI just realized it's important how one introduces new ideas to people,
p115
aVthat's why these patents are sometimes necessary.
p116
aVI would like to do a short test with you.
p117
aVEveryone is sitting in quite an orderly fashion here this morning.
p118
aVSo I would like to ask you all to raise your right hand. Yeah.
p119
aVThe right hand is the one we write with, apart from the left-handers.
p120
aVAnd now, I'll count to three. I mean, it still looks very orderly to me.
p121
aVNow, I'll count to three, and on the count of three
p122
aVI'd like you all to shake hands with the person behind you. OK?
p123
aVOne, two, three.
p124
aV(Laughter)
p125
aa(lp126
VYou can see now, that's a good example: even behaving in an orderly, systematic way
p127
aVcan sometimes lead to complete chaos.
p128
aVSo we can also see that very clearly in this next painting.
p129
aVThis is a painting by the artist, Niki de Saint Phalle.
p130
aVAnd I mean, in the original it's completely unclear to see
p131
aVwhat this tangle of colors and shapes is supposed to depict.
p132
aVBut in the tidied up version, it's plain to see that it's a sunburnt woman playing volleyball.
p133
aV(Laughter)
p134
aVYeah, it's a \u2014 this one here, that's much better.
p135
aVThat's a picture by Keith Haring.
p136
aV(Laughter)
p137
aVI think it doesn't matter.
p138
aVSo, I mean, this picture has not even got a proper title.
p139
aVIt's called "Untitled" and I think that's appropriate.
p140
aa(lp141
VSo, in the tidied-up version we have a sort of Keith Haring spare parts shop.
p142
aV(Laughter)
p143
aVThis is Keith Haring looked at statistically.
p144
aVOne can see here quite clearly,
p145
aVyou can see we have 25 pale green elements,
p146
aVof which one is in the form of a circle.
p147
aVOr here, for example, we have 27 pink squares with only one pink curve.
p148
aVI mean, that's interesting. One could extend this sort of statistical analysis
p149
aVto cover all Mr. Haring's various works,
p150
aVin order to establish in which period the artist favored pale green circles or pink squares.
p151
aVAnd the artist himself could also benefit from this sort of listing procedure
p152
aVby using it to estimate how many pots of paint he's likely to need in the future.
p153
aV(Laughter)
p154
aa(lp155
VOne can obviously also make combinations.
p156
aVFor example, with the Keith Haring circles and Kandinsky's dots.
p157
aVYou can add them to all the squares of Paul Klee.
p158
aVIn the end, one has a list with which one then can arrange.
p159
aVThen you categorize it, then you file it, put that file in a filing cabinet,
p160
aVput it in your office and you can make a living doing it.
p161
aV(Laughter)
p162
aVYeah, from my own experience. So I'm \u2014
p163
aV(Laughter)
p164
aVActually, I mean, here we have some artists that are a bit more structured. It's not too bad.
p165
aVThis is Jasper Johns. We can see here he was practicing with his ruler.
p166
aV(Laughter)
p167
aa(lp168
VBut I think it could still benefit from more discipline.
p169
aVAnd I think the whole thing adds up much better if you do it like this.
p170
aV(Laughter)
p171
aVAnd here, that's one of my favorites.
p172
aVTidying up Rene Magritte \u2014 this is really fun.
p173
aVYou know, there is a \u2014
p174
aV(Laughter)
p175
aVI'm always being asked what inspired me to embark on all this.
p176
aVIt goes back to a time when I was very often staying in hotels.
p177
aVSo once I had the opportunity to stay in a ritzy, five-star hotel.
p178
aVAnd you know, there you had this little sign \u2014
p179
aVI put this little sign outside the door every morning that read,
p180
aV"Please tidy room." I don't know if you have them over here.
p181
aVSo actually, my room there hasn't been tidied once daily, but three times a day.
p182
aVSo after a while I decided to have a little fun,
p183
aVand before leaving the room each day I'd scatter a few things around the space.
p184
aVLike books, clothes, toothbrush, etc. And it was great.
p185
aVBy the time I returned everything had always been neatly returned to its place.
p186
aVBut then one morning, I hang the same little sign onto that picture by Vincent van Gogh.
p187
aV(Laughter)
p188
aVAnd you have to say this room hadn't been tidied up since 1888.
p189
aVAnd when I returned it looked like this.
p190
aV(Laughter)
p191
aVYeah, at least it is now possible to do some vacuuming.
p192
aV(Laughter)
p193
aa(lp194
VOK, I mean, I can see there are always people
p195
aVthat like reacting that one or another picture
p196
aVhasn't been properly tidied up. So we can make a short test with you.
p197
aVThis is a picture by Rene Magritte,
p198
aVand I'd like you all to inwardly \u2014 like in your head, that is \u2014
p199
aVto tidy that up. So it's possible that some of you would make it like this.
p200
aV(Laughter)
p201
aVYeah? I would actually prefer to do it more this way.
p202
aVSome people would make apple pie out of it.
p203
aVBut it's a very good example to see that the whole work
p204
aVwas more of a handicraft endeavor that involved the very time-consuming job
p205
aVof cutting out the various elements and sticking them back in new arrangements.
p206
aVAnd it's not done, as many people imagine, with the computer,
p207
aVotherwise it would look like this.
p208
aV(Laughter)
p209
aa(lp210
VSo now I've been able to tidy up pictures that I've wanted to tidy up for a long time.
p211
aVHere is a very good example. Take Jackson Pollock, for example.
p212
aVIt's \u2014 oh, no, it's \u2014 that's a really hard one.
p213
aVBut after a while, I just decided here to go all the way
p214
aVand put the paint back into the cans.
p215
aV(Applause)
p216
aVOr you could go into three-dimensional art.
p217
aVHere we have the fur cup by Meret Oppenheim.
p218
aVHere I just brought it back to its original state.
p219
aV(Laughter)
p220
aVBut yeah, and it's great, you can even go, you know \u2014
p221
aVOr we have this pointillist movement for those of you who are into art.
p222
aVThe pointillist movement is that kind of paintings
p223
aVwhere everything is broken down into dots and pixels.
p224
aVAnd then I \u2014 this sort of thing is ideal for tidying up.
p225
aV(Laughter)
p226
aa(lp227
VSo I once applied myself to the work of the inventor of that method, Georges Seurat,
p228
aVand I collected together all his dots.
p229
aVAnd now they're all in here.
p230
aV(Laughter)
p231
aVYou can count them afterwards, if you like.
p232
aVYou see, that's the wonderful thing about the tidy up art idea:
p233
aVit's new. So there is no existing tradition in it.
p234
aVThere is no textbooks, I mean, not yet, anyway.
p235
aVI mean, it's "the future we will create."
p236
aV(Laughter)
p237
aVBut to round things up I would like to show you just one more.
p238
aVThis is the village square by Pieter Bruegel.
p239
aVThat's how it looks like when you send everyone home.
p240
aV(Laughter)
p241
aVYeah, maybe you're asking yourselves
p242
aVwhere old Bruegel's people went?
p243
aVOf course, they're not gone. They're all here.
p244
aV(Laughter)
p245
aVI just piled them up.
p246
aV(Laughter)
p247
aa(lp248
VSo I'm \u2014 yeah, actually I'm kind of finished at that moment.
p249
aVAnd for those who want to see more, I've got my book downstairs in the bookshop.
p250
aVAnd I'm happy to sign it for you with any name of any artist.
p251
aV(Laughter)
p252
aVBut before leaving I would like to show you,
p253
aVI'm working right now on another \u2014 in a related field
p254
aVwith my tidying up art method. I'm working in a related field.
p255
aVAnd I started to bring some order into some flags.
p256
aVHere \u2014 that's just my new proposal here for the Union Jack.
p257
aV(Laughter)
p258
aVAnd then maybe before I leave you ...
p259
aVyeah, I think, after you have seen that I have to leave anyway.
p260
aV(Laughter)
p261
aVYeah, that was a hard one. I couldn't find a way to tidy that up properly,
p262
aVso I just decided to make it a little bit more simpler.
p263
aV(Laughter)
p264
aVThank you very much.
