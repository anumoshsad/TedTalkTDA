VI've been playing TED for nearly a decade,
p4
aVand I've very rarely played
p5
aVany new songs of my own.
p6
aVAnd that was largely because there weren't any.
p7
aa(lp8
V(Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
VSo I've been busy with a couple of projects,
p11
aVand one of them was this:
p12
aVThe Nutmeg.
p13
aVA 1930s ship's lifeboat,
p14
aVwhich I've been restoring in the garden
p15
aVof my beach house in England.
p16
aVAnd, so now,
p17
aVwhen the polar ice caps melt,
p18
aVmy recording studio will rise up like an ark,
p19
aVand I'll float off into the drowned world
p20
aVlike a character from a J.G. Ballard novel.
p21
aVDuring the day,
p22
aVthe Nutmeg collects energy
p23
aVfrom solar panels on the roof of the wheelhouse,
p24
aVand from a 450 watt turbine
p25
aVup the mast.
p26
aVSo that when it gets dark,
p27
aVI've got plenty of power.
p28
aVAnd I can light up the Nutmeg like a beacon.
p29
aVAnd so I go in there until the early hours of the morning,
p30
aVand I work on new songs.
p31
aVI'd like to play to you guys,
p32
aVif you're willing to be the first audience to hear it.
p33
aa(lp34
V(Applause)
p35
aa(lp36
VIt's about Billie Holiday.
p37
aVAnd it appears that,
p38
aVsome night in 1947
p39
aVshe left her physical space
p40
aVand was missing all night,
p41
aVuntil she reappeared in the morning.
p42
aVBut I know where she was.
p43
aVShe was with me on my lifeboat.
p44
aVAnd she was hot.
