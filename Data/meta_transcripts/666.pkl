VI'm sure that, throughout the hundred-thousand-odd years
p4
aVof our species' existence,
p5
aVand even before,
p6
aVour ancestors looked up at the night sky,
p7
aVand wondered what stars are.
p8
aVWondering, therefore,
p9
aVhow to explain what they saw
p10
aVin terms of things unseen.
p11
aa(lp12
VOkay, so, most people
p13
aVonly wondered that occasionally, like today,
p14
aVin breaks from whatever
p15
aVnormally preoccupied them.
p16
aVBut what normally preoccupied them
p17
aValso involved yearning to know.
p18
aVThey wished they knew
p19
aVhow to prevent their food supply
p20
aVfrom sometimes failing,
p21
aVand how they could rest when they were tired
p22
aVwithout risking starvation,
p23
aVbe warmer, cooler, safer,
p24
aVin less pain.
p25
aVI bet those prehistoric cave artists
p26
aVwould have loved to know
p27
aVhow to draw better.
p28
aa(lp29
VIn every aspect of their lives,
p30
aVthey wished for progress, just as we do.
p31
aVBut they failed, almost completely, to make any.
p32
aVThey didn't know how to.
p33
aVDiscoveries like fire
p34
aVhappened so rarely, that from an individual's point of view,
p35
aVthe world never improved.
p36
aVNothing new was learned.
p37
aa(lp38
VThe first clue to the origin of starlight
p39
aVhappened as recently as 1899: radioactivity.
p40
aVWithin 40 years,
p41
aVphysicists discovered the whole explanation,
p42
aVexpressed, as usual, in elegant symbols.
p43
aVBut never mind the symbols.
p44
aVThink how many discoveries
p45
aVthey represent.
p46
aVNuclei and nuclear reactions, of course.
p47
aVBut isotopes, particles of electricity,
p48
aVantimatter,
p49
aVneutrinos,
p50
aVthe conversion of mass to energy \u2014 that's E=mc^2 \u2014
p51
aVgamma rays,
p52
aVtransmutation.
p53
aVThat ancient dream that had always eluded the alchemists
p54
aVwas achieved through these same theories
p55
aVthat explained starlight
p56
aVand other ancient mysteries,
p57
aVand new, unexpected phenomena.
p58
aa(lp59
VThat all that, discovered in 40 years,
p60
aVhad not been in the previous hundred thousand,
p61
aVwas not for lack of thinking
p62
aVabout stars, and all those other urgent problems they had.
p63
aVThey even arrived at answers,
p64
aVsuch as myths,
p65
aVthat dominated their lives,
p66
aVyet bore almost no resemblance
p67
aVto the truth.
p68
aVThe tragedy of that protracted stagnation
p69
aVisn't sufficiently recognized, I think.
p70
aVThese were people with brains of
p71
aVessentially the same design
p72
aVthat eventually did discover all those things.
p73
aVBut that ability to make progress
p74
aVremained almost unused,
p75
aVuntil the event that
p76
aVrevolutionized the human condition
p77
aVand changed the universe.
p78
aa(lp79
VOr so we should hope.
p80
aVBecause that event was the
p81
aVScientific Revolution,
p82
aVever since which our knowledge
p83
aVof the physical world,
p84
aVand of how to adapt it to our wishes,
p85
aVhas been growing relentlessly.
p86
aVNow, what had changed?
p87
aVWhat were people now doing for the first time
p88
aVthat made that difference
p89
aVbetween stagnation
p90
aVand rapid, open-ended discovery?
p91
aVHow to make that difference
p92
aVis surely the most important universal truth
p93
aVthat it is possible to know.
p94
aVWorryingly, there is no consensus about what it is.
p95
aVSo, I'll tell you.
p96
aVBut I'll have to backtrack a little first.
p97
aa(lp98
VBefore the Scientific Revolution,
p99
aVthey believed that everything important, knowable,
p100
aVwas already known,
p101
aVenshrined in ancient writings, institutions,
p102
aVand in some genuinely useful rules of thumb \u2014
p103
aVwhich were, however, entrenched as dogmas,
p104
aValong with many falsehoods.
p105
aVSo they believed that knowledge came from authorities
p106
aVthat actually knew very little.
p107
aVAnd therefore progress
p108
aVdepended on learning how to reject
p109
aVthe authority of learned men,
p110
aVpriests, traditions and rulers.
p111
aVWhich is why the Scientific Revolution
p112
aVhad to have a wider context.
p113
aa(lp114
VThe Enlightenment, a revolution in how
p115
aVpeople sought knowledge,
p116
aVtrying not to rely on authority.
p117
aV"Take no one's word for it."
p118
aVBut that can't be what made the difference.
p119
aVAuthorities had been rejected before, many times.
p120
aVAnd that rarely, if ever,
p121
aVcaused anything like the Scientific Revolution.
p122
aVAt the time, what they thought
p123
aVdistinguished science
p124
aVwas a radical idea about things unseen,
p125
aVknown as empiricism.
p126
aVAll knowledge derives from the senses.
p127
aVWell, we've seen that that can't be true.
p128
aVIt did help by promoting
p129
aVobservation and experiment.
p130
aVBut, from the outset, it was obvious
p131
aVthat there was something horribly wrong with it.
p132
aa(lp133
VKnowledge comes from the senses.
p134
aVIn what language? Certainly not the language of mathematics,
p135
aVin which, Galileo rightly said,
p136
aVthe book of nature is written.
p137
aVLook at the world. You don't see equations
p138
aVcarved on to the mountainsides.
p139
aVIf you did, it would be because people
p140
aVhad carved them.
p141
aVBy the way, why don't we do that?
p142
aVWhat's wrong with us?
p143
aV(Laughter)
p144
aa(lp145
VEmpiricism is inadequate
p146
aVbecause, well,
p147
aVscientific theories explain the seen in terms of the unseen.
p148
aVAnd the unseen, you have to admit,
p149
aVdoesn't come to us through the senses.
p150
aVWe don't see those nuclear reactions in stars.
p151
aVWe don't see the origin of species.
p152
aVWe don't see the curvature of space-time,
p153
aVand other universes.
p154
aVBut we know about those things.
p155
aVHow?
p156
aa(lp157
VWell, the classic empiricist answer is induction.
p158
aVThe unseen resembles the seen.
p159
aVBut it doesn't.
p160
aVYou know what the clinching evidence was
p161
aVthat space-time is curved?
p162
aVIt was a photograph, not of space-time,
p163
aVbut of an eclipse, with a dot there rather than there.
p164
aVAnd the evidence for evolution?
p165
aVSome rocks and some finches.
p166
aVAnd parallel universes? Again: dots there,
p167
aVrather than there, on a screen.
p168
aVWhat we see, in all these cases,
p169
aVbears no resemblance to the reality
p170
aVthat we conclude is responsible \u2014
p171
aVonly a long chain of theoretical reasoning
p172
aVand interpretation connects them.
p173
aa(lp174
V"Ah!" say creationists.
p175
aV"So you admit it's all interpretation.
p176
aVNo one has ever seen evolution.
p177
aVWe see rocks.
p178
aVYou have your interpretation. We have ours.
p179
aVYours comes from guesswork,
p180
aVours from the Bible."
p181
aVBut what creationist and empiricists both ignore
p182
aVis that, in that sense,
p183
aVno one has ever seen a bible either,
p184
aVthat the eye only detects light, which we don't perceive.
p185
aVBrains only detect nerve impulses.
p186
aVAnd they don't perceive even those as what they really are,
p187
aVnamely electrical crackles.
p188
aVSo we perceive nothing as what it really is.
p189
aa(lp190
VOur connection to reality
p191
aVis never just perception.
p192
aVIt's always, as Karl Popper put it,
p193
aVtheory-laden.
p194
aVScientific knowledge isn't derived from anything.
p195
aVIt's like all knowledge. It's conjectural, guesswork,
p196
aVtested by observation,
p197
aVnot derived from it.
p198
aVSo, were testable conjectures
p199
aVthe great innovation that opened the intellectual prison gates?
p200
aVNo. Contrary to what's usually said,
p201
aVtestability is common,
p202
aVin myths and all sorts of other irrational modes of thinking.
p203
aVAny crank claiming the sun will go out next Tuesday
p204
aVhas got a testable prediction.
p205
aa(lp206
VConsider the ancient Greek myth
p207
aVexplaining seasons.
p208
aVHades, God of the Underworld,
p209
aVkidnaps Persephone, the Goddess of Spring,
p210
aVand negotiates a forced marriage contract,
p211
aVrequiring her to return regularly, and lets her go.
p212
aVAnd each year,
p213
aVshe is magically compelled to return.
p214
aVAnd her mother, Demeter,
p215
aVGoddess of the Earth,
p216
aVis sad, and makes it cold and barren.
p217
aVThat myth is testable.
p218
aVIf winter is caused by Demeter's sadness,
p219
aVthen it must happen everywhere on Earth simultaneously.
p220
aVSo if the ancient Greeks had only known that Australia
p221
aVis at its warmest when Demeter is at her saddest,
p222
aVthey'd have known that their theory is false.
p223
aa(lp224
VSo what was wrong with that myth,
p225
aVand with all pre-scientific thinking,
p226
aVand what, then, made that momentous difference?
p227
aVI think there is one thing you have to care about.
p228
aVAnd that implies
p229
aVtestability, the scientific method,
p230
aVthe Enlightenment, and everything.
p231
aVAnd here is the crucial thing.
p232
aVThere is such a thing as a defect in a story.
p233
aVI don't just mean a logical defect. I mean a bad explanation.
p234
aVWhat does that mean? Well, explanation
p235
aVis an assertion about what's there, unseen,
p236
aVthat accounts for what's seen.
p237
aa(lp238
VBecause the explanatory role
p239
aVof Persephone's marriage contract
p240
aVcould be played equally well
p241
aVby infinitely many other
p242
aVad hoc entities.
p243
aVWhy a marriage contract and not any other reason
p244
aVfor regular annual action?
p245
aVHere is one. Persephone wasn't released.
p246
aVShe escaped, and returns every spring
p247
aVto take revenge on Hades,
p248
aVwith her Spring powers.
p249
aVShe cools his domain with Spring air,
p250
aVventing heat up to the surface, creating summer.
p251
aVThat accounts for the same phenomena as the original myth.
p252
aVIt's equally testable.
p253
aVYet what it asserts about reality
p254
aVis, in many ways, the opposite.
p255
aVAnd that is possible because
p256
aVthe details of the original myth
p257
aVare unrelated to seasons,
p258
aVexcept via the myth itself.
p259
aa(lp260
VThis easy variability
p261
aVis the sign of a bad explanation,
p262
aVbecause, without a functional reason to prefer
p263
aVone of countless variants,
p264
aVadvocating one of them, in preference to the others,
p265
aVis irrational.
p266
aVSo, for the essence of what
p267
aVmakes the difference to enable progress,
p268
aVseek good explanations,
p269
aVthe ones that can't be easily varied,
p270
aVwhile still explaining the phenomena.
p271
aa(lp272
VNow, our current explanation of seasons
p273
aVis that the Earth's axis is tilted like that,
p274
aVso each hemisphere tilts toward the sun for half the year,
p275
aVand away for the other half.
p276
aVBetter put that up.
p277
aV(Laughter)
p278
aVThat's a good explanation: hard to vary,
p279
aVbecause every detail plays a functional role.
p280
aVFor instance, we know, independently of seasons,
p281
aVthat surfaces tilted away
p282
aVfrom radiant heat are heated less,
p283
aVand that a spinning sphere, in space,
p284
aVpoints in a constant direction.
p285
aVAnd the tilt also explains
p286
aVthe sun's angle of elevation at different times of year,
p287
aVand predicts that the seasons
p288
aVwill be out of phase in the two hemispheres.
p289
aVIf they'd been observed in phase,
p290
aVthe theory would have been refuted.
p291
aVBut now, the fact that it's also a good explanation,
p292
aVhard to vary, makes the crucial difference.
p293
aa(lp294
VIf the ancient Greeks had found out
p295
aVabout seasons in Australia,
p296
aVthey could have easily varied their myth
p297
aVto predict that.
p298
aVFor instance, when Demeter is upset,
p299
aVshe banishes heat from her vicinity,
p300
aVinto the other hemisphere, where it makes summer.
p301
aVSo, being proved wrong by observation,
p302
aVand changing their theory accordingly,
p303
aVstill wouldn't have got the ancient Greeks
p304
aVone jot closer to understanding seasons,
p305
aVbecause their explanation was bad: easy to vary.
p306
aVAnd it's only when an explanation is good
p307
aVthat it even matters whether it's testable.
p308
aVIf the axis-tilt theory had been refuted,
p309
aVits defenders would have had nowhere to go.
p310
aVNo easily implemented change
p311
aVcould make that tilt
p312
aVcause the same seasons in both hemispheres.
p313
aa(lp314
VThe search for hard-to-vary explanations
p315
aVis the origin of all progress.
p316
aVIt's the basic regulating principle
p317
aVof the Enlightenment.
p318
aVSo, in science, two false approaches blight progress.
p319
aVOne is well known: untestable theories.
p320
aVBut the more important one is explanationless theories.
p321
aVWhenever you're told that some existing statistical trend will continue,
p322
aVbut you aren't given a hard-to-vary account
p323
aVof what causes that trend,
p324
aVyou're being told a wizard did it.
p325
aa(lp326
VWhen you are told that carrots have human rights
p327
aVbecause they share half our genes \u2014
p328
aVbut not how gene percentages confer rights \u2014 wizard.
p329
aVWhen someone announces that the nature-nurture debate
p330
aVhas been settled because there is evidence
p331
aVthat a given percentage of our
p332
aVpolitical opinions are genetically inherited,
p333
aVbut they don't explain how genes cause opinions,
p334
aVthey've settled nothing. They are saying that our
p335
aVopinions are caused by wizards,
p336
aVand presumably so are their own.
p337
aVThat the truth consists of
p338
aVhard to vary assertions about reality
p339
aVis the most important fact
p340
aVabout the physical world.
p341
aVIt's a fact that is, itself, unseen,
p342
aVyet impossible to vary. Thank you.
