VI'm going to talk today
p4
aVabout the pleasures of everyday life.
p5
aVBut I want to begin with a story
p6
aVof an unusual and terrible man.
p7
aVThis is Hermann Goering.
p8
aVGoering was Hitler's second in command in World War II,
p9
aVhis designated successor.
p10
aVAnd like Hitler,
p11
aVGoering fancied himself a collector of art.
p12
aVHe went through Europe, through World War II,
p13
aVstealing, extorting and occasionally buying
p14
aVvarious paintings for his collection.
p15
aVAnd what he really wanted was something by Vermeer.
p16
aVHitler had two of them, and he didn't have any.
p17
aVSo he finally found an art dealer,
p18
aVa Dutch art dealer named Han van Meegeren,
p19
aVwho sold him a wonderful Vermeer
p20
aVfor the cost of what would now be 10 million dollars.
p21
aVAnd it was his favorite artwork ever.
p22
aa(lp23
VWorld War II came to an end,
p24
aVand Goering was captured, tried at Nuremberg
p25
aVand ultimately sentenced to death.
p26
aVThen the Allied forces went through his collections
p27
aVand found the paintings
p28
aVand went after the people who sold it to him.
p29
aVAnd at some point the Dutch police came into Amsterdam
p30
aVand arrested Van Meegeren.
p31
aVVan Meegeren was charged with the crime of treason,
p32
aVwhich is itself punishable by death.
p33
aVSix weeks into his prison sentence,
p34
aVvan Meegeren confessed.
p35
aVBut he didn't confess to treason.
p36
aVHe said, "I did not sell a great masterpiece
p37
aVto that Nazi.
p38
aVI painted it myself; I'm a forger."
p39
aVNow nobody believed him.
p40
aVAnd he said, "I'll prove it.
p41
aVBring me a canvas and some paint,
p42
aVand I will paint a Vermeer much better
p43
aVthan I sold that disgusting Nazi.
p44
aVI also need alcohol and morphine, because it's the only way I can work."
p45
aV(Laughter)
p46
aVSo they brought him in.
p47
aVHe painted a beautiful Vermeer.
p48
aVAnd then the charges of treason were dropped.
p49
aVHe had a lesser charge of forgery,
p50
aVgot a year sentence
p51
aVand died a hero to the Dutch people.
p52
aVThere's a lot more to be said about van Meegeren,
p53
aVbut I want to turn now to Goering,
p54
aVwho's pictured here being interrogated at Nuremberg.
p55
aa(lp56
VNow Goering was, by all accounts, a terrible man.
p57
aVEven for a Nazi, he was a terrible man.
p58
aVHis American interrogators described him
p59
aVas an amicable psychopath.
p60
aVBut you could feel sympathy
p61
aVfor the reaction he had
p62
aVwhen he was told that his favorite painting
p63
aVwas actually a forgery.
p64
aVAccording to his biographer,
p65
aV"He looked as if for the first time
p66
aVhe had discovered there was evil in the world."
p67
aV(Laughter)
p68
aVAnd he killed himself soon afterwards.
p69
aVHe had discovered after all
p70
aVthat the painting he thought was this
p71
aVwas actually that.
p72
aVIt looked the same,
p73
aVbut it had a different origin, it was a different artwork.
p74
aa(lp75
VIt wasn't just him who was in for a shock.
p76
aVOnce van Meegeren was on trial, he couldn't stop talking.
p77
aVAnd he boasted about all the great masterpieces
p78
aVthat he himself had painted
p79
aVthat were attributed to other artists.
p80
aVIn particular, "The Supper at Emmaus"
p81
aVwhich was viewed as Vermeer's finest masterpiece, his best work \u2014
p82
aVpeople would come [from] all over the world to see it \u2014
p83
aVwas actually a forgery.
p84
aVIt was not that painting, but that painting.
p85
aVAnd when that was discovered,
p86
aVit lost all its value and was taken away from the museum.
p87
aa(lp88
VWhy does this matter?
p89
aVI'm a psychologists \u2014 why do origins matter so much?
p90
aVWhy do we respond so much
p91
aVto our knowledge of where something comes from?
p92
aVWell there's an answer that many people would give.
p93
aVMany sociologists like Veblen and Wolfe
p94
aVwould argue that the reason why we take origins so seriously
p95
aVis because we're snobs, because we're focused on status.
p96
aVAmong other things,
p97
aVif you want to show off how rich you are, how powerful you are,
p98
aVit's always better to own an original than a forgery
p99
aVbecause there's always going to be fewer originals than forgeries.
p100
aVI don't doubt that that plays some role,
p101
aVbut what I want to convince you of today
p102
aVis that there's something else going on.
p103
aVI want to convince you
p104
aVthat humans are, to some extent, natural born essentialists.
p105
aVWhat I mean by this
p106
aVis we don't just respond to things as we see them,
p107
aVor feel them, or hear them.
p108
aVRather, our response is conditioned on our beliefs,
p109
aVabout what they really are, what they came from,
p110
aVwhat they're made of, what their hidden nature is.
p111
aVI want to suggest that this is true,
p112
aVnot just for how we think about things,
p113
aVbut how we react to things.
p114
aa(lp115
VSo I want to suggest that pleasure is deep \u2014
p116
aVand that this isn't true
p117
aVjust for higher level pleasures like art,
p118
aVbut even the most seemingly simple pleasures
p119
aVare affected by our beliefs about hidden essences.
p120
aVSo take food.
p121
aVWould you eat this?
p122
aVWell, a good answer is, "It depends. What is it?"
p123
aVSome of you would eat it if it's pork, but not beef.
p124
aVSome of you would eat it if it's beef, but not pork.
p125
aVFew of you would eat it if it's a rat
p126
aVor a human.
p127
aVSome of you would eat it only if it's a strangely colored piece of tofu.
p128
aVThat's not so surprising.
p129
aa(lp130
VBut what's more interesting
p131
aVis how it tastes to you
p132
aVwill depend critically on what you think you're eating.
p133
aVSo one demonstration of this was done with young children.
p134
aVHow do you make children
p135
aVnot just be more likely to eat carrots and drink milk,
p136
aVbut to get more pleasure from eating carrots and drinking milk \u2014
p137
aVto think they taste better?
p138
aVIt's simple, you tell them they're from McDonald's.
p139
aVThey believe McDonald's food is tastier,
p140
aVand it leads them to experience it as tastier.
p141
aa(lp142
VHow do you get adults to really enjoy wine?
p143
aVIt's very simple:
p144
aVpour it from an expensive bottle.
p145
aVThere are now dozens, perhaps hundreds of studies showing
p146
aVthat if you believe you're drinking the expensive stuff,
p147
aVit tastes better to you.
p148
aVThis was recently done with a neuroscientific twist.
p149
aVThey get people into a fMRI scanner,
p150
aVand while they're lying there, through a tube,
p151
aVthey get to sip wine.
p152
aVIn front of them on a screen is information about the wine.
p153
aVEverybody, of course,
p154
aVdrinks exactly the same wine.
p155
aVBut if you believe you're drinking expensive stuff,
p156
aVparts of the brain associated with pleasure and reward
p157
aVlight up like a Christmas tree.
p158
aVIt's not just that you say it's more pleasurable, you say you like it more,
p159
aVyou really experience it in a different way.
p160
aa(lp161
VOr take sex.
p162
aVThese are stimuli I've used in some of my studies.
p163
aVAnd if you simply show people these pictures,
p164
aVthey'll say these are fairly attractive people.
p165
aVBut how attractive you find them,
p166
aVhow sexually or romantically moved you are by them,
p167
aVrests critically on who you think you're looking at.
p168
aVYou probably think the picture on the left is male,
p169
aVthe one on the right is female.
p170
aVIf that belief turns out to be mistaken, it will make a difference.
p171
aV(Laughter)
p172
aVIt will make a difference if they turn out to be
p173
aVmuch younger or much older than you think they are.
p174
aVIt will make a difference if you were to discover
p175
aVthat the person you're looking at with lust
p176
aVis actually a disguised version of your son or daughter,
p177
aVyour mother or father.
p178
aVKnowing somebody's your kin typically kills the libido.
p179
aVMaybe one of the most heartening findings
p180
aVfrom the psychology of pleasure
p181
aVis there's more to looking good than your physical appearance.
p182
aVIf you like somebody, they look better to you.
p183
aVThis is why spouses in happy marriages
p184
aVtend to think that their husband or wife
p185
aVlooks much better than anyone else thinks that they do.
p186
aa(lp187
V(Laughter)
p188
aa(lp189
VA particularly dramatic example of this
p190
aVcomes from a neurological disorder known as Capgras syndrome.
p191
aVSo Capgras syndrome is a disorder
p192
aVwhere you get a specific delusion.
p193
aVSufferers of Capgras syndrome
p194
aVbelieve that the people they love most in the world
p195
aVhave been replaced by perfect duplicates.
p196
aVNow often, a result of Capgras syndrome is tragic.
p197
aVPeople have murdered those that they loved,
p198
aVbelieving that they were murdering an imposter.
p199
aVBut there's at least one case
p200
aVwhere Capgras syndrome had a happy ending.
p201
aVThis was recorded in 1931.
p202
aV"Research described a woman with Capgras syndrome
p203
aVwho complained about her poorly endowed and sexually inadequate lover."
p204
aVBut that was before she got Capgras syndrome.
p205
aVAfter she got it, "She was happy to report
p206
aVthat she has discovered that he possessed a double
p207
aVwho was rich, virile, handsome and aristocratic."
p208
aVOf course, it was the same man,
p209
aVbut she was seeing him in different ways.
p210
aa(lp211
VAs a third example,
p212
aVconsider consumer products.
p213
aVSo one reason why you might like something is its utility.
p214
aVYou can put shoes on your feet; you can play golf with golf clubs;
p215
aVand chewed up bubble gum doesn't do anything at all for you.
p216
aVBut each of these three objects has value
p217
aVabove and beyond what it can do for you
p218
aVbased on its history.
p219
aVThe golf clubs were owned by John F. Kennedy
p220
aVand sold for three-quarters of a million dollars at auction.
p221
aVThe bubble gum was chewed up by pop star Britney Spears
p222
aVand sold for several hundreds of dollars.
p223
aVAnd in fact, there's a thriving market
p224
aVin the partially eaten food of beloved people.
p225
aV(Laughter)
p226
aVThe shoes are perhaps the most valuable of all.
p227
aVAccording to an unconfirmed report,
p228
aVa Saudi millionaire offered 10 million dollars
p229
aVfor this pair of shoes.
p230
aVThey were the ones thrown at George Bush
p231
aVat an Iraqi press conference several years ago.
p232
aa(lp233
V(Applause)
p234
aa(lp235
VNow this attraction to objects
p236
aVdoesn't just work for celebrity objects.
p237
aVEach one of us, most people,
p238
aVhave something in our life that's literally irreplaceable,
p239
aVin that it has value because of its history \u2014
p240
aVmaybe your wedding ring, maybe your child's baby shoes \u2014
p241
aVso that if it was lost, you couldn't get it back.
p242
aVYou could get something that looked like it or felt like it,
p243
aVbut you couldn't get the same object back.
p244
aVWith my colleagues George Newman and Gil Diesendruck,
p245
aVwe've looked to see what sort of factors, what sort of history, matters
p246
aVfor the objects that people like.
p247
aVSo in one of our experiments,
p248
aVwe asked people to name a famous person who they adored,
p249
aVa living person they adored.
p250
aa(lp251
VSo one answer was George Clooney.
p252
aVThen we asked them,
p253
aV"How much would you pay for George Clooney's sweater?"
p254
aVAnd the answer is a fair amount \u2014
p255
aVmore than you would pay for a brand new sweater
p256
aVor a sweater owned by somebody who you didn't adore.
p257
aVThen we asked other groups of subjects \u2014
p258
aVwe gave them different restrictions
p259
aVand different conditions.
p260
aVSo for instance, we told some people,
p261
aV"Look, you can buy the sweater,
p262
aVbut you can't tell anybody you own it,
p263
aVand you can't resell it."
p264
aVThat drops the value of it,
p265
aVsuggesting that that's one reason why we like it.
p266
aVBut what really causes an effect
p267
aVis you tell people, "Look, you could resell it, you could boast about it,
p268
aVbut before it gets to you,
p269
aVit's thoroughly washed."
p270
aVThat causes a huge drop in the value.
p271
aVAs my wife put it, "You've washed away the Clooney cooties."
p272
aa(lp273
V(Laughter)
p274
aa(lp275
VSo let's go back to art.
p276
aVI would love a Chagall. I love the work of Chagall.
p277
aVIf people want to get me something at the end of the conference,
p278
aVyou could buy me a Chagall.
p279
aVBut I don't want a duplicate,
p280
aVeven if I can't tell the difference.
p281
aVThat's not because, or it's not simply because,
p282
aVI'm a snob and want to boast about having an original.
p283
aVRather, it's because I want something that has a specific history.
p284
aVIn the case of artwork,
p285
aVthe history is special indeed.
p286
aVThe philosopher Denis Dutton
p287
aVin his wonderful book "The Art Instinct"
p288
aVmakes the case that, "The value of an artwork
p289
aVis rooted in assumptions about the human performance underlying its creation."
p290
aVAnd that could explain the difference
p291
aVbetween an original and a forgery.
p292
aVThey may look alike, but they have a different history.
p293
aVThe original is typically the product of a creative act,
p294
aVthe forgery isn't.
p295
aVI think this approach can explain differences
p296
aVin people's taste in art.
p297
aa(lp298
VThis is a work by Jackson Pollock.
p299
aVWho here likes the work of Jackson Pollock?
p300
aVOkay. Who here, it does nothing for them?
p301
aVThey just don't like it.
p302
aVI'm not going to make a claim about who's right,
p303
aVbut I will make an empirical claim
p304
aVabout people's intuitions,
p305
aVwhich is that, if you like the work of Jackson Pollock,
p306
aVyou'll tend more so than the people who don't like it
p307
aVto believe that these works are difficult to create,
p308
aVthat they require a lot of time and energy
p309
aVand creative energy.
p310
aVI use Jackson Pollock on purpose as an example
p311
aVbecause there's a young American artist
p312
aVwho paints very much in the style of Jackson Pollock,
p313
aVand her work was worth
p314
aVmany tens of thousands of dollars \u2014
p315
aVin large part because she's a very young artist.
p316
aa(lp317
VThis is Marla Olmstead
p318
aVwho did most of her work when she was three years old.
p319
aVThe interesting thing about Marla Olmstead
p320
aVis her family made the mistake
p321
aVof inviting the television program 60 Minutes II into their house
p322
aVto film her painting.
p323
aVAnd they then reported that her father was coaching her.
p324
aVWhen this came out on television,
p325
aVthe value of her art dropped to nothing.
p326
aVIt was the same art, physically,
p327
aVbut the history had changed.
p328
aa(lp329
VI've been focusing now on the visual arts,
p330
aVbut I want to give two examples from music.
p331
aVThis is Joshua Bell, a very famous violinist.
p332
aVAnd the Washington Post reporter Gene Weingarten
p333
aVdecided to enlist him for an audacious experiment.
p334
aVThe question is: How much would people like Joshua Bell,
p335
aVthe music of Joshua Bell,
p336
aVif they didn't know they were listening to Joshua Bell?
p337
aVSo he got Joshua Bell to take his million dollar violin
p338
aVdown to a Washington D.C. subway station
p339
aVand stand in the corner and see how much money he would make.
p340
aVAnd here's a brief clip of this.
p341
aV(Violin music)
p342
aVAfter being there for three-quarters of an hour,
p343
aVhe made 32 dollars.
p344
aVNot bad. It's also not good.
p345
aVApparently to really enjoy the music of Joshua Bell,
p346
aVyou have to know you're listening to Joshua Bell.
p347
aVHe actually made 20 dollars more than that,
p348
aVbut he didn't count it.
p349
aVBecause this woman comes up \u2014
p350
aVyou see at the end of the video \u2014 she comes up.
p351
aVShe had heard him at the Library of Congress a few weeks before
p352
aVat this extravagant black-tie affair.
p353
aVSo she's stunned that he's standing in a subway station.
p354
aVSo she's struck with pity.
p355
aVShe reaches into her purse and hands him a 20.
p356
aa(lp357
V(Laughter)
p358
aa(lp359
V(Applause)
p360
aa(lp361
VThe second example from music
p362
aVis from John Cage's modernist composition,
p363
aV"4'33"."
p364
aVAs many of you know,
p365
aVthis is the composition where the pianist sits at a bench,
p366
aVopens up the piano
p367
aVand sits and does nothing for four minutes and 33 seconds \u2014
p368
aVthat period of silence.
p369
aVAnd people have different views on this.
p370
aVBut what I want to point out
p371
aVis you can buy this from iTunes.
p372
aV(Laughter)
p373
aVFor a dollar 99,
p374
aVyou can listen to that silence,
p375
aVwhich is different than other forms of silence.
p376
aa(lp377
V(Laughter)
p378
aa(lp379
VNow I've been talking so far about pleasure,
p380
aVbut what I want to suggest
p381
aVis that everything I've said applies as well to pain.
p382
aVAnd how you think about what you're experiencing,
p383
aVyour beliefs about the essence of it,
p384
aVaffect how it hurts.
p385
aVOne lovely experiment
p386
aVwas done by Kurt Gray and Dan Wegner.
p387
aVWhat they did was they hooked up Harvard undergraduates
p388
aVto an electric shock machine.
p389
aVAnd they gave them a series of painful electric shocks.
p390
aVSo it was a series of five painful shocks.
p391
aVHalf of them are told that they're being given the shocks
p392
aVby somebody in another room,
p393
aVbut the person in the other room doesn't know they're giving them shocks.
p394
aVThere's no malevolence, they're just pressing a button.
p395
aVThe first shock is recorded as very painful.
p396
aVThe second shock feels less painful, because you get a bit used to it.
p397
aVThe third drops, the fourth, the fifth.
p398
aVThe pain gets less.
p399
aVIn the other condition,
p400
aVthey're told that the person in the next room
p401
aVis shocking them on purpose \u2014 knows they're shocking them.
p402
aVThe first shock hurts like hell.
p403
aVThe second shock hurts just as much,
p404
aVand the third and the fourth and the fifth.
p405
aVIt hurts more
p406
aVif you believe somebody is doing it to you on purpose.
p407
aa(lp408
VThe most extreme example of this
p409
aVis that in some cases,
p410
aVpain under the right circumstances
p411
aVcan transform into pleasure.
p412
aVHumans have this extraordinarily interesting property
p413
aVthat will often seek out low-level doses of pain
p414
aVin controlled circumstances
p415
aVand take pleasure from it \u2014
p416
aVas in the eating of hot chili peppers
p417
aVand roller coaster rides.
p418
aVThe point was nicely summarized
p419
aVby the poet John Milton
p420
aVwho wrote, "The mind is its own place,
p421
aVand in itself can make a heaven of hell,
p422
aVa hell of heaven."
p423
aa(lp424
VAnd I'll end with that. Thank you.
