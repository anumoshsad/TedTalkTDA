VI once said,
p4
aV"If you want to liberate a society,
p5
aVall you need is the Internet."
p6
aVI was wrong.
p7
aa(lp8
VI said those words back in 2011,
p9
aVwhen a Facebook page I anonymously created
p10
aVhelped spark the Egyptian revolution.
p11
aVThe Arab Spring revealed social media's greatest potential,
p12
aVbut it also exposed its greatest shortcomings.
p13
aVThe same tool that united us to topple dictators
p14
aVeventually tore us apart.
p15
aVI would like to share my own experience in using social media for activism,
p16
aVand talk about some of the challenges I have personally faced
p17
aVand what we could do about them.
p18
aa(lp19
VIn the early 2000s,
p20
aVArabs were flooding the web.
p21
aVThirsty for knowledge, for opportunities,
p22
aVfor connecting with the rest of the people around the globe,
p23
aVwe escaped our frustrating political realities
p24
aVand lived a virtual, alternative life.
p25
aVJust like many of them, I was completely apolitical until 2009.
p26
aVAt the time, when I logged into social media,
p27
aVI started seeing more and more Egyptians
p28
aVaspiring for political change in the country.
p29
aVIt felt like I was not alone.
p30
aa(lp31
VIn June 2010,
p32
aVInternet changed my life forever.
p33
aVWhile browsing Facebook,
p34
aVI saw a photo, a terrifying photo, of a tortured, dead body
p35
aVof a young Egyptian guy.
p36
aVHis name was Khaled Said.
p37
aVKhaled was a 29-year-old Alexandrian who was killed by police.
p38
aVI saw myself in his picture.
p39
aVI thought, "I could be Khaled."
p40
aa(lp41
VI could not sleep that night, and I decided to do something.
p42
aVI anonymously created a Facebook page
p43
aVand called it "We are all Khaled Said."
p44
aVIn just three days, the page had over 100,000 people,
p45
aVfellow Egyptians who shared the same concern.
p46
aVWhatever was happening had to stop.
p47
aa(lp48
VI recruited my co-admin, AbdelRahman Mansour.
p49
aVWe worked together for hours and hours.
p50
aVWe were crowdsourcing ideas from the people.
p51
aVWe were engaging them.
p52
aVWe were calling collectively for actions,
p53
aVand sharing news that the regime did not want Egyptians to know.
p54
aVThe page became the most followed page
p55
aVin the Arab world.
p56
aVIt had more fans than established media organizations
p57
aVand even top celebrities.
p58
aa(lp59
VOn January 14, 2011,
p60
aVBen Ali fled out of Tunisia
p61
aVafter mounting protests against his regime.
p62
aVI saw a spark of hope.
p63
aVEgyptians on social media were wondering,
p64
aV"If Tunisia did it, why can't we?"
p65
aVI posted an event on Facebook and called it
p66
aV"A Revolution against Corruption, Injustice and Dictatorship."
p67
aVI posed a question to the 300,000 users of the page at the time:
p68
aV"Today is the 14th of January.
p69
aVThe 25th of January is Police Day.
p70
aVIt's a national holiday.
p71
aVIf 100,000 of us take to the streets of Cairo,
p72
aVno one is going to stop us.
p73
aVI wonder if we could do it."
p74
aa(lp75
VIn just a few days, the invitation reached over a million people,
p76
aVand over 100,000 people confirmed attendance.
p77
aVSocial media was crucial for this campaign.
p78
aVIt helped a decentralized movement arise.
p79
aVIt made people realize that they were not alone.
p80
aVAnd it made it impossible for the regime to stop it.
p81
aVAt the time, they didn't even understand it.
p82
aVAnd on January 25th, Egyptians flooded the streets of Cairo and other cities,
p83
aVcalling for change,
p84
aVbreaking the barrier of fear
p85
aVand announcing a new era.
p86
aa(lp87
VThen came the consequences.
p88
aVA few hours before the regime cut off the Internet and telecommunications,
p89
aVI was walking in a dark street in Cairo, around midnight.
p90
aVI had just tweeted, "Pray for Egypt.
p91
aVThe government must be planning a massacre tomorrow."
p92
aa(lp93
VI was hit hard on my head.
p94
aVI lost my balance and fell down,
p95
aVto find four armed men surrounding me.
p96
aVOne covered my mouth and the others paralyzed me.
p97
aVI knew I was being kidnapped by state security.
p98
aa(lp99
VI found myself in a cell,
p100
aVhandcuffed, blindfolded.
p101
aVI was terrified.
p102
aVSo was my family,
p103
aVwho started looking for me
p104
aVin hospitals, police stations and even morgues.
p105
aa(lp106
VAfter my disappearance,
p107
aVa few of my fellow colleagues who knew I was the admin of the page
p108
aVtold the media about my connection with that page,
p109
aVand that I was likely arrested by state security.
p110
aVMy colleagues at Google started a search campaign trying to find me,
p111
aVand the fellow protesters in the square demanded my release.
p112
aa(lp113
VAfter 11 days of complete darkness,
p114
aVI was set free.
p115
aVAnd three days later,
p116
aVMubarak was forced to step down.
p117
aVIt was the most inspiring and empowering moment of my life.
p118
aVIt was a time of great hope.
p119
aVEgyptians lived a utopia for 18 days during the revolution.
p120
aVThey all shared the belief
p121
aVthat we could actually live together despite our differences,
p122
aVthat Egypt after Mubarak would be for all.
p123
aa(lp124
VBut unfortunately,
p125
aVthe post-revolution events were like a punch in the gut.
p126
aVThe euphoria faded,
p127
aVwe failed to build consensus,
p128
aVand the political struggle led to intense polarization.
p129
aVSocial media only amplified that state,
p130
aVby facilitating the spread of misinformation, rumors,
p131
aVecho chambers and hate speech.
p132
aVThe environment was purely toxic.
p133
aVMy online world became a battleground filled with trolls, lies, hate speech.
p134
aVI started to worry about the safety of my family.
p135
aVBut of course, this wasn't just about me.
p136
aVThe polarization reached its peak between the two main powers \u2014
p137
aVthe army supporters and the Islamists.
p138
aVPeople in the center, like me,
p139
aVstarted feeling helpless.
p140
aVBoth groups wanted you to side with them;
p141
aVyou were either with them or against them.
p142
aVAnd on the 3rd of July 2013,
p143
aVthe army ousted Egypt's first democratically elected president,
p144
aVafter three days of popular protest that demanded his resignation.
p145
aa(lp146
VThat day I made a very hard decision.
p147
aVI decided to go silent, completely silent.
p148
aVIt was a moment of defeat.
p149
aVI stayed silent for more than two years,
p150
aVand I used the time to reflect on everything that happened,
p151
aVtrying to understand why did it happen.
p152
aVIt became clear to me
p153
aVthat while it's true that polarization is primarily driven
p154
aVby our human behavior,
p155
aVsocial media shapes this behavior and magnifies its impact.
p156
aVSay you want to say something that is not based on a fact,
p157
aVpick a fight or ignore someone that you don't like.
p158
aVThese are all natural human impulses,
p159
aVbut because of technology,
p160
aVacting on these impulses is only one click away.
p161
aa(lp162
VIn my view, there are five critical challenges
p163
aVfacing today's social media.
p164
aa(lp165
VFirst, we don't know how to deal with rumors.
p166
aVRumors that confirm people's biases
p167
aVare now believed and spread among millions of people.
p168
aa(lp169
VSecond, we create our own echo chambers.
p170
aVWe tend to only communicate with people that we agree with,
p171
aVand thanks to social media,
p172
aVwe can mute, un-follow and block everybody else.
p173
aa(lp174
VThird, online discussions quickly descend into angry mobs.
p175
aVAll of us probably know that.
p176
aVIt's as if we forget
p177
aVthat the people behind screens are actually real people
p178
aVand not just avatars.
p179
aa(lp180
VAnd fourth, it became really hard to change our opinions.
p181
aVBecause of the speed and brevity of social media,
p182
aVwe are forced to jump to conclusions
p183
aVand write sharp opinions in 140 characters
p184
aVabout complex world affairs.
p185
aVAnd once we do that, it lives forever on the Internet,
p186
aVand we are less motivated to change these views,
p187
aVeven when new evidence arises.
p188
aa(lp189
VFifth \u2014 and in my point of view, this is the most critical \u2014
p190
aVtoday, our social media experiences are designed in a way
p191
aVthat favors broadcasting over engagements,
p192
aVposts over discussions,
p193
aVshallow comments over deep conversations.
p194
aVIt's as if we agreed that we are here to talk at each other
p195
aVinstead of talking with each other.
p196
aa(lp197
VI witnessed how these critical challenges contributed
p198
aVto an already polarized Egyptian society,
p199
aVbut this is not just about Egypt.
p200
aVPolarization is on the rise in the whole world.
p201
aVWe need to work hard on figuring out
p202
aVhow technology could be part of the solution,
p203
aVrather than part of the problem.
p204
aa(lp205
VThere's a lot of debate today on how to combat online harassment
p206
aVand fight trolls.
p207
aVThis is so important.
p208
aVNo one could argue against that.
p209
aVBut we need to also think about how to design social media experiences
p210
aVthat promote civility and reward thoughtfulness.
p211
aVI know for a fact
p212
aVif I write a post that is more sensational,
p213
aVmore one-sided, sometimes angry and aggressive,
p214
aVI get to have more people see that post.
p215
aVI will get more attention.
p216
aa(lp217
VBut what if we put more focus on quality?
p218
aVWhat is more important:
p219
aVthe total number of readers of a post you write,
p220
aVor who are the people who have impact that read what you write?
p221
aVCouldn't we just give people more incentives to engage in conversations,
p222
aVrather than just broadcasting opinions all the time?
p223
aVOr reward people for reading
p224
aVand responding to views that they disagree with?
p225
aVAnd also, make it socially acceptable that we change our minds,
p226
aVor probably even reward that?
p227
aVWhat if we have a matrix that says how many people changed their minds,
p228
aVand that becomes part of our social media experience?
p229
aVIf I could track how many people are changing their minds,
p230
aVI'd probably write more thoughtfully, trying to do that,
p231
aVrather than appealing to the people who already agree with me
p232
aVand "liking" because I just confirmed their biases.
p233
aa(lp234
VWe also need to think about effective crowdsourcing mechanisms,
p235
aVto fact-check widely spread online information,
p236
aVand reward people who take part in that.
p237
aVIn essence, we need to rethink today's social media ecosystem
p238
aVand redesign its experiences
p239
aVto reward thoughtfulness, civility and mutual understanding.
p240
aa(lp241
VAs a believer in the Internet, I teamed up with a few friends,
p242
aVstarted a new project,
p243
aVtrying to find answers and explore possibilities.
p244
aVOur first product is a new media platform for conversations.
p245
aVWe're hosting conversations that promote mutual understanding
p246
aVand hopefully change minds.
p247
aVWe don't claim to have the answers,
p248
aVbut we started experimenting with different discussions
p249
aVabout very divisive issues,
p250
aVsuch as race, gun control, the refugee debate,
p251
aVrelationship between Islam and terrorism.
p252
aVThese are conversations that matter.
p253
aa(lp254
VToday, at least one out of three people on the planet
p255
aVhave access to the Internet.
p256
aVBut part of this Internet is being held captive
p257
aVby the less noble aspects of our human behavior.
p258
aa(lp259
VFive years ago, I said,
p260
aV"If you want to liberate society,
p261
aVall you need is the Internet."
p262
aa(lp263
VToday, I believe if we want to liberate society,
p264
aVwe first need to liberate the Internet.
p265
aa(lp266
VThank you very much.
