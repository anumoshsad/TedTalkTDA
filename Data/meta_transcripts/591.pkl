VLast year at TED we aimed to try to clarify
p4
aVthe overwhelming complexity
p5
aVand richness that we experience at the conference
p6
aVin a project called Big Viz.
p7
aVAnd the Big Viz is a collection of 650 sketches
p8
aVthat were made by two visual artists.
p9
aVDavid Sibbet from The Grove,
p10
aVand Kevin Richards, from Autodesk,
p11
aVmade 650 sketches that strive to capture
p12
aVthe essence of each presenter's ideas.
p13
aVAnd the consensus was: it really worked.
p14
aVThese sketches brought to life the key ideas,
p15
aVthe portraits, the magic moments
p16
aVthat we all experienced last year.
p17
aa(lp18
VThis year we were thinking, "Why does it work?"
p19
aVWhat is it about animation,
p20
aVgraphics, illustrations, that create meaning?
p21
aVAnd this is an important question to ask and answer
p22
aVbecause the more we understand how the brain creates meaning,
p23
aVthe better we can communicate,
p24
aVand, I also think, the better we can think and collaborate together.
p25
aVSo this year we're going to visualize how
p26
aVthe brain visualizes.
p27
aa(lp28
VCognitive psychologists now tell us that the brain
p29
aVdoesn't actually see the world as it is,
p30
aVbut instead, creates a series of mental models
p31
aVthrough a collection of "Ah-ha moments,"
p32
aVor moments of discovery, through various processes.
p33
aa(lp34
VThe processing, of course, begins with the eyes.
p35
aVLight enters, hits the back of the retina, and is circulated,
p36
aVmost of which is streamed to the very back of the brain,
p37
aVat the primary visual cortex.
p38
aVAnd primary visual cortex sees just simple geometry,
p39
aVjust the simplest of shapes.
p40
aVBut it also acts like a kind of relay station
p41
aVthat re-radiates and redirects information
p42
aVto many other parts of the brain.
p43
aVAs many as 30 other parts that selectively make more sense,
p44
aVcreate more meaning through the kind of "Ah-ha" experiences.
p45
aVWe're only going to talk about three of them.
p46
aa(lp47
VSo the first one is called the ventral stream.
p48
aVIt's on this side of the brain.
p49
aVAnd this is the part of the brain that will recognize what something is.
p50
aVIt's the "what" detector.
p51
aVLook at a hand. Look at a remote control. Chair. Book.
p52
aVSo that's the part of the brain that is activated
p53
aVwhen you give a word to something.
p54
aa(lp55
VA second part of the brain is called the dorsal stream.
p56
aVAnd what it does is locates the object
p57
aVin physical body space.
p58
aVSo if you look around the stage here
p59
aVyou'll create a kind of mental map of the stage.
p60
aVAnd if you closed your eyes you'd be able to mentally navigate it.
p61
aVYou'd be activating the dorsal stream if you did that.
p62
aa(lp63
VThe third part that I'd like to talk about
p64
aVis the limbic system.
p65
aVAnd this is deep inside of the brain. It's very old, evolutionarily.
p66
aVAnd it's the part that feels.
p67
aVIt's the kind of gut center, where you see an image
p68
aVand you go, "Oh! I have a strong
p69
aVor emotional reaction to whatever I'm seeing."
p70
aa(lp71
VSo the combination of these processing centers
p72
aVhelp us make meaning in very different ways.
p73
aVSo what can we learn about this? How can we apply this insight?
p74
aVWell, again, the schematic view
p75
aVis that the eye visually interrogates what we look at.
p76
aVThe brain processes this in parallel, the figments of information
p77
aVasking a whole bunch of questions
p78
aVto create a unified mental model.
p79
aa(lp80
VSo, for example, when you look at this image
p81
aVa good graphic invites the eye to dart around,
p82
aVto selectively create a visual logic.
p83
aVSo the act of engaging, and looking at the image creates the meaning.
p84
aVIt's the selective logic.
p85
aVNow we've augmented this and spatialized this information.
p86
aVMany of you may remember the magic wall that we built
p87
aVin conjunction with Perceptive Pixel
p88
aVwhere we quite literally create an infinite wall.
p89
aVAnd so we can compare and contrast the big ideas.
p90
aVSo the act of engaging and creating interactive imagery
p91
aVenriches meaning.
p92
aVIt activates a different part of the brain.
p93
aVAnd then the limbic system
p94
aVis activated when we see motion, when we see color,
p95
aVand there are primary shapes and pattern detectors
p96
aVthat we've heard about before.
p97
aa(lp98
VSo the point of this is what?
p99
aVWe make meaning by seeing,
p100
aVby an act of visual interrogation.
p101
aVThe lessons for us are three-fold.
p102
aVFirst, use images to clarify what we're trying to communicate.
p103
aVSecondly make those images interactive
p104
aVso that we engage much more fully.
p105
aVAnd the third is to augment memory
p106
aVby creating a visual persistence.
p107
aVThese are techniques that can be used to be \u2014
p108
aVthat can be applied in a wide range of problem solving.
p109
aa(lp110
VSo the low-tech version looks like this.
p111
aVAnd, by the way, this is the way in which
p112
aVwe develop and formulate
p113
aVstrategy within Autodesk,
p114
aVin some of our organizations and some of our divisions.
p115
aVWhat we literally do is have the teams
p116
aVdraw out the entire strategic plan
p117
aVon one giant wall.
p118
aVAnd it's very powerful because everyone gets to see everything else.
p119
aVThere's always a room, always a place
p120
aVto be able to make sense of all of the components
p121
aVin the strategic plan.
p122
aa(lp123
VThis is a time-lapse view of it.
p124
aVYou can ask the question, "Who's the boss?"
p125
aVYou'll be able to figure that out. (Laughter)
p126
aVSo the act of collectively and collaboratively
p127
aVbuilding the image
p128
aVtransforms the collaboration.
p129
aVNo Powerpoint is used in two days.
p130
aVBut instead the entire team
p131
aVcreates a shared mental model
p132
aVthat they can all agree on and move forward on.
p133
aa(lp134
VAnd this can be enhanced and augmented with
p135
aVsome emerging digital technology.
p136
aVAnd this is our great unveiling for today.
p137
aVAnd this is an emerging set of technologies
p138
aVthat use large-screen displays
p139
aVwith intelligent calculation in the background
p140
aVto make the invisible visible.
p141
aVHere what we can do is look at sustainability, quite literally.
p142
aVSo a team can actually look at
p143
aVall the key components that heat the structure
p144
aVand make choices and then see the end result
p145
aVthat is visualized on this screen.
p146
aa(lp147
VSo making images meaningful has three components.
p148
aVThe first again, is making ideas clear by visualizing them.
p149
aVSecondly, making them interactive.
p150
aVAnd then thirdly, making them persistent.
p151
aVAnd I believe that these three principles
p152
aVcan be applied to solving some of the very tough problems
p153
aVthat we face in the world today. Thanks so much.
