VBack in 1992, I started working for a company
p4
aVcalled Interval Research,
p5
aVwhich was just then being founded
p6
aVby David Lidell and Paul Allen
p7
aVas a for-profit research enterprise in Silicon Valley.
p8
aa(lp9
VI met with David
p10
aVto talk about what I might do in his company.
p11
aVI was just coming out of a failed virtual reality business
p12
aVand supporting myself by being on the speaking circuit
p13
aVand writing books \u2014
p14
aVafter twenty years or so in the computer game industry
p15
aVhaving ideas that people didn't think they could sell.
p16
aa(lp17
VAnd David and I discovered
p18
aVthat we had a question in common,
p19
aVthat we really wanted the answer to,
p20
aVand that was,
p21
aV"Why hasn't anybody built any computer games for little girls?"
p22
aVWhy is that?
p23
aVIt can't just be a giant sexist conspiracy.
p24
aVThese people aren't that smart.
p25
aVThere's six billion dollars on the table.
p26
aVThey would go for it if they could figure out how.
p27
aa(lp28
VSo, what is the deal here?
p29
aVAnd as we thought about our goals \u2014
p30
aVI should say that Interval is really a humanistic institution,
p31
aVin the classical sense
p32
aVthat humanism, at its best,
p33
aVfinds a way to combine clear-eyed empirical research
p34
aVwith a set of core values
p35
aVthat fundamentally love and respect people.
p36
aVThe basic idea of humanism
p37
aVis the improvable quality of life;
p38
aVthat we can do good things,
p39
aVthat there are things worth doing
p40
aVbecause they're good things to do,
p41
aVand that clear-eyed empiricism
p42
aVcan help us figure out how to do them.
p43
aa(lp44
VSo, contrary to popular belief,
p45
aVthere is not a conflict of interest between empiricism and values.
p46
aVAnd Interval Research is kind of the living example
p47
aVof how that can be true.
p48
aVSo David and I decided to go find out,
p49
aVthrough the best research we could muster,
p50
aVwhat it would take to get a little girl
p51
aVto put her hands on a computer,
p52
aVto achieve the level of comfort and ease with the technology
p53
aVthat little boys have because they play video games.
p54
aa(lp55
VWe spent two and a half years conducting research;
p56
aVwe spent another year and a half in advance development.
p57
aVThen we formed a spin-off company.
p58
aVIn the research phase of the project at Interval,
p59
aVwe partnered with a company called Cheskin Research,
p60
aVand these people \u2014 Davis Masten and Christopher Ireland \u2014
p61
aVchanged my mind entirely about what market research was
p62
aVand what it could be.
p63
aVThey taught me how to look and see,
p64
aVand they did not do the incredibly stupid thing
p65
aVof saying to a child,
p66
aV"Of all these things we already make you,
p67
aVwhich do you like best?" \u2014
p68
aVwhich gives you zero answers that are usable.
p69
aa(lp70
VSo, what we did for the first two and a half years
p71
aVwas four things:
p72
aVWe did an extensive review of the literature
p73
aVin related fields, like cognitive psychology,
p74
aVspatial cognition, gender studies,
p75
aVplay theory, sociology, primatology.
p76
aVThank you Frans de Waal, wherever you are,
p77
aVI love you and I'd give anything to meet you.
p78
aa(lp79
VAfter we had done that with a pretty large team of people
p80
aVand discovered what we thought the salient issues were
p81
aVwith girls and boys and playing \u2014
p82
aVbecause, after all, that's really what this is about \u2014
p83
aVwe moved to the second phase of our work,
p84
aVwhere we interviewed adult experts
p85
aVin academia, some of the people
p86
aVwho'd produced the literature that we found relevant.
p87
aVAlso, we did focus groups with people who were on the ground with kids every day,
p88
aVlike playground supervisors. We talked to them,
p89
aVconfirmed some hypotheses and identified some serious questions
p90
aVabout gender difference and play.
p91
aa(lp92
VThen we did what I consider to be the heart of the work:
p93
aVinterviewed 1,100 children, boys and girls,
p94
aVages seven to 12, all over the United States \u2014
p95
aVexcept for Silicon Valley, Boston and Austin
p96
aVbecause we knew that their little families would have millions of computers in them
p97
aVand they wouldn't be a representative sample.
p98
aa(lp99
VAnd at the end of those remarkable conversations
p100
aVwith kids and their best friends across the United States,
p101
aVafter two years, we pulled together some survey data from another 10,000 children,
p102
aVdrew up a set up of what we thought were the key findings of our research,
p103
aVand spent another year transforming them into design heuristics,
p104
aVfor designing computer-based products \u2014
p105
aVand, in fact, any kind of products \u2014 for little girls, ages eight to 12.
p106
aVAnd we spent that time designing interactive prototypes for computer software
p107
aVand testing them with little girls.
p108
aVIn 1996, in November, we formed the company Purple Moon
p109
aVwhich was a spinoff of Interval Research,
p110
aVand our chief investors were Interval Research, Vulcan Northwest,
p111
aVInstitutional Venture Partners and Allen and Company.
p112
aa(lp113
VWe launched a website on September 2nd
p114
aVthat has now served 25 million pages,
p115
aVand has 42,000 registered young girl users.
p116
aVThey visit an average of one and a half times a day,
p117
aVspend an average of 35 minutes a visit,
p118
aVand look at 50 pages a visit.
p119
aVSo we feel that we've formed a successful online community with girls.
p120
aa(lp121
VWe launched two titles in October \u2014
p122
aV"Rockett's New School" \u2014 the first of a series
p123
aVof products \u2014 is about a character called Rockett beginning her first day of school
p124
aVin eighth grade at a brand new place, with a blank slate,
p125
aVwhich allows girls to play with the question of, "What will I be like when I'm older?"
p126
aV"What's it going to be like to be in high school or junior high school?
p127
aVWho are my friends?";
p128
aVto exercise the love of social complexity
p129
aVand the narrative intelligence that drives most of their play behavior;
p130
aVand which embeds in it values about noticing that we have lots of choices
p131
aVin our lives and the ways that we conduct ourselves.
p132
aa(lp133
VThe other title that we launched is called "Secret Paths in the Forest,"
p134
aVwhich addresses the more fantasy-oriented, inner lives of girls.
p135
aVThese two titles both showed up in the top 50 entertainment titles in PC Data \u2014
p136
aVentertainment titles in PC Data
p137
aVin December, right up there with "John Madden Football,"
p138
aVwhich thrills me to death.
p139
aVSo, we're real,
p140
aVand we've touched several hundreds of thousands of little girls.
p141
aVWe've made half-a-billion impressions
p142
aVwith marketing and PR for this brand, Purple Moon.
p143
aVNinety-six percent of them, roughly, have been positive;
p144
aVfour percent of them have been "other."
p145
aVI want to talk about the other,
p146
aVbecause the politics of this enterprise, in a way,
p147
aVhave been the most fascinating part of it, for me.
p148
aa(lp149
VThere are really two kinds of negative reviews that we've received.
p150
aVOne kind of reviewer is a male gamer
p151
aVwho thinks he knows what games ought to be,
p152
aVand won't show the product to little girls.
p153
aVThe other kind of reviewer is a certain flavor of feminist
p154
aVwho thinks they know what little girls ought to be.
p155
aVAnd so it's funny to me that these interesting, odd bedfellows
p156
aVhave one thing in common:
p157
aVthey don't listen to little girls.
p158
aVThey haven't looked at children
p159
aVand they're certainly not demonstrating any love for them.
p160
aVI'd like to play you some voices of little girls
p161
aVfrom the two-and-a-half years of research that we did \u2014
p162
aVactually, some of the voices are more recent.
p163
aVAnd these voices will be accompanied by photographs
p164
aVthat they took for us of their lives,
p165
aVof the things that they value and care about.
p166
aVThese are pictures the girls themselves never saw, but they gave to us
p167
aVThis is the stuff those reviewers don't know about and aren't listening to
p168
aVand this is the kind of research I recommend to those
p169
aVwho want to do humanistic work.
p170
aa(lp171
VGirl 1: Yeah, my character is usually a tomboy.
p172
aVHers is more into boys.
p173
aa(lp174
VGirl 2: Uh, yeah.
p175
aa(lp176
VGirl 1: We have \u2014 in the very beginning of the whole game, always we do this:
p177
aVwe each have a piece of paper; we write down our name, our age \u2014
p178
aVare we rich, very rich, not rich, poor, medium, wealthy,
p179
aVboyfriends, dogs, pets \u2014 what else \u2014 sisters, brothers, and all those.
p180
aa(lp181
VGirl 2: Divorced \u2014 parents divorced, maybe.
p182
aa(lp183
VGirl 3: This is my pretend [unclear] one.
p184
aa(lp185
VGirl 4: We make a school newspaper on the computer.
p186
aa(lp187
VGirl 5: For a girl's game also usually they'll have really pretty scenery
p188
aVwith clouds and flowers.
p189
aVGirl 6: Like, if you were a girl and you were really adventurous and a real big tomboy,
p190
aVyou would think that girls' games were kinda sissy.
p191
aa(lp192
VGirl 7: I run track, I played soccer,
p193
aVI play basketball, and I love a lot of things to do.
p194
aVAnd sometimes I feel like I can't really enjoy myself unless it's like a vacation,
p195
aVlike when I get Mondays and all those days off.
p196
aa(lp197
VGirl 8: Well, sometimes there is a lot of stuff going on
p198
aVbecause I have music lessons and I'm on swim team \u2014
p199
aVall this different stuff that I have to do,
p200
aVand sometimes it gets overwhelming.
p201
aVGirl 9: My friend Justine
p202
aVkinda took my friend Kelly, and now they're being mean to me.
p203
aa(lp204
VGirl 10: Well, sometimes it gets annoying when your brothers and sisters,
p205
aVor brother or sister, when they copy you and you get your idea first
p206
aVand they take your idea and they do it themselves.
p207
aa(lp208
VGirl 11: Because my older sister, she gets everything
p209
aVand, like, when I ask my mom for something, she'll say, "No" \u2014 all the time.
p210
aVBut she gives my sister everything.
p211
aa(lp212
VBrenda Laurel: I want to show you, real quickly, just a minute
p213
aVof "Rockett's Tricky Decision," which went gold two days ago.
p214
aVLet's hope it's really stable.
p215
aVThis is the second day in Rockett's life.
p216
aVThe reason I'm showing you this
p217
aVis I'm hoping that the scene that I'm going to show you will look familiar
p218
aVand sound familiar, now that you've listened to some girls' voices.
p219
aVAnd you can see how we've tried to incorporate the issues that matter to them
p220
aVin the game that we've created.
p221
aa(lp222
VMiko: Hey Rockett! C'mere!
p223
aa(lp224
VRockett: Hi Miko! What's going on?
p225
aa(lp226
VMiko: Did you hear about Nakilia's big Halloween party this weekend?
p227
aVShe asked me to make sure you knew about it.
p228
aVNakilia invited Reuben too, but \u2014
p229
aa(lp230
VRockett: But what? Isn't he coming?
p231
aa(lp232
VMiko: I don't think so.
p233
aVI mean, I heard his band is playing at another party the same night.
p234
aa(lp235
VRockett: Really? What other party?
p236
aa(lp237
VGirl: Max's party is going to be so cool, Whitney.
p238
aVHe's invited all the best people.
p239
aa(lp240
VBL: I'm going to fast-forward to the decision point
p241
aVbecause I know I don't have a lot of time.
p242
aVAfter this awful event occurs, Rocket gets to decide how she feels about it.
p243
aa(lp244
VRockett: Who'd want to show up at that party anyway?
p245
aVI could get invited to that party any day if I wanted to.
p246
aVGee, I doubt I'll make Max's best people list.
p247
aa(lp248
VBL: OK, so we're going to emotionally navigate.
p249
aVIf we were playing the game, that's what we'd do.
p250
aVIf at any time during the game we want to learn more about the characters,
p251
aVwe can go into this hidden hallway,
p252
aVand I'll quickly just show you the interface.
p253
aVWe can, for example, go find Miko's locker
p254
aVand get some more information about her.
p255
aVOops, I turned the wrong way.
p256
aVBut you get the general idea of the product.
p257
aa(lp258
VI wanted to show you the ways, innocuous as they seem,
p259
aVin which we're incorporating what we've learned about girls \u2014
p260
aVtheir desires to experience greater emotional flexibility,
p261
aVand to play around with the social complexity of their lives.
p262
aVI want to make the point that what we're giving girls, I think, through this effort,
p263
aVis a kind of validation,
p264
aVa sense of being seen.
p265
aVAnd a sense of the choices that are available in their lives.
p266
aVWe love them.
p267
aVWe see them.
p268
aVWe're not trying to tell them who they ought to be.
p269
aVBut we're really, really happy about who they are.
p270
aVIt turns out they're really great.
p271
aa(lp272
VI want to close by showing you a videotape
p273
aVthat's a version of a future game in the Rockett series
p274
aVthat our graphic artists and design people put together,
p275
aVthat we feel would please that four percent of reviewers.
p276
aV"Rockett 28!"
p277
aa(lp278
VRockett: It's like I'm just waking up, you know?
p279
aa(lp280
