VSo we all have our own biases.
p4
aVFor example, some of us tend to think
p5
aVthat it's very difficult to transform failing government systems.
p6
aVWhen we think of government systems,
p7
aVwe tend to think that they're archaic, set in their ways,
p8
aVand perhaps, the leadership is just too bureaucratic
p9
aVto be able to change things.
p10
aVWell, today, I want to challenge that theory.
p11
aVI want to tell you a story of a very large government system
p12
aVthat has not only put itself on the path of reform
p13
aVbut has also shown fairly spectacular results
p14
aVin less than three years.
p15
aa(lp16
VThis is what a classroom in a public school in India looks like.
p17
aVThere are 1 million such schools in India.
p18
aVAnd even for me, who's lived in India all her life,
p19
aVwalking into one of these schools is fairly heartbreaking.
p20
aVBy the time kids are 11,
p21
aV50 percent of them have fallen so far behind in their education
p22
aVthat they have no hope to recover.
p23
aV11-year-olds cannot do simple addition,
p24
aVthey cannot construct a grammatically correct sentence.
p25
aVThese are things that you and I would expect an 8-year-old
p26
aVto be able to do.
p27
aVBy the time kids are 13 or 14,
p28
aVthey tend to drop out of schools.
p29
aVIn India, public schools not only offer free education \u2014
p30
aVthey offer free textbooks, free workbooks, free meals,
p31
aVsometimes even cash scholarships.
p32
aVAnd yet, 40 percent of the parents today
p33
aVare choosing to pull their children out of public schools
p34
aVand pay out of their pockets to put them in private schools.
p35
aVAs a comparison, in a far richer country, the US,
p36
aVthat number is only 10 percent.
p37
aVThat's a huge statement on how broken the Indian public education system is.
p38
aa(lp39
VSo it was with that background that I got a call in the summer of 2013
p40
aVfrom an absolutely brilliant lady called Surina Rajan.
p41
aVShe was, at that time, the head of the Department of School Education
p42
aVin a state called Haryana in India.
p43
aVSo she said to us, "Look, I've been heading this department
p44
aVfor the last two years.
p45
aVI've tried a number of things, and nothing seems to work.
p46
aVCan you possibly help?"
p47
aa(lp48
VLet me describe Haryana a little bit to you.
p49
aVHaryana is a state which has 30 million people.
p50
aVIt has 15,000 public schools
p51
aVand 2 million plus children in those public schools.
p52
aVSo basically, with that phone call,
p53
aVI promised to help a state and system
p54
aVwhich was as large as that of Peru or Canada transform itself.
p55
aVAs I started this project, I was very painfully aware of two things.
p56
aVOne, that I had never done anything like this before.
p57
aVAnd two, many others had, perhaps without too much success.
p58
aVAs my colleagues and I looked across the country
p59
aVand across the world,
p60
aVwe couldn't find another example
p61
aVthat we could just pick up and replicate in Haryana.
p62
aVWe knew that we had to craft our own journey.
p63
aa(lp64
VBut anyway, we jumped right in and as we jumped in,
p65
aVall sorts of ideas started flying at us.
p66
aVPeople said, "Let's change the way we recruit teachers,
p67
aVlet's hire new principals and train them
p68
aVand send them on international learning tours,
p69
aVlet's put technology inside classrooms."
p70
aVBy the end of week one, we had 50 ideas on the table,
p71
aVall amazing, all sounded right.
p72
aVThere was no way we were going to be able to implement 50 things.
p73
aa(lp74
VSo I said, "Hang on, stop.
p75
aVLet's first at least decide what is it we're trying to achieve."
p76
aVSo with a lot of push and pull and debate,
p77
aVHaryana set itself a goal which said: by 2020,
p78
aVwe want 80 percent of our children to be at grade-level knowledge.
p79
aVNow the specifics of the goal don't matter here,
p80
aVbut what matters is how specific the goal is.
p81
aVBecause it really allowed us to take all those ideas
p82
aVwhich were being thrown at us
p83
aVand say which ones we were going to implement.
p84
aVDoes this idea support this goal? If yes, let's keep it.
p85
aVBut if it doesn't or we're not sure, then let's put it aside.
p86
aVAs simple as it sounds, having a very specific goal right up front
p87
aVhas really allowed us to be very sharp and focused
p88
aVin our transformation journey.
p89
aVAnd looking back over the last two and a half years,
p90
aVthat has been a huge positive for us.
p91
aa(lp92
VSo we had the goal,
p93
aVand now we needed to figure out what are the issues, what is broken.
p94
aVBefore we went into schools, a lot of people told us
p95
aVthat education quality is poor
p96
aVbecause either the teachers are lazy, they don't come into schools,
p97
aVor they're incapable, they actually don't know how to teach.
p98
aVWell, when we went inside schools, we found something completely different.
p99
aVOn most days, most teachers were actually inside schools.
p100
aVAnd when you spoke with them,
p101
aVyou realized they were perfectly capable of teaching elementary classes.
p102
aVBut they were not teaching.
p103
aVI went to a school
p104
aVwhere the teachers were getting the construction of a classroom
p105
aVand a toilet supervised.
p106
aVI went to another school
p107
aVwhere two of the teachers had gone to a nearby bank branch
p108
aVto deposit scholarship money into kids' accounts.
p109
aVAt lunchtime, most teachers were spending all of their time
p110
aVgetting the midday meal cooking, supervised and served to the students.
p111
aa(lp112
VSo we asked the teachers,
p113
aV"What's going on, why are you not teaching?"
p114
aVAnd they said, "This is what's expected of us.
p115
aVWhen a supervisor comes to visit us,
p116
aVthese are exactly the things that he checks.
p117
aVHas the toilet been made, has the meal been served.
p118
aVWhen my principal goes to a meeting at headquarters,
p119
aVthese are exactly the things which are discussed."
p120
aa(lp121
VYou see, what had happened was, over the last two decades,
p122
aVIndia had been fighting the challenge of access, having enough schools,
p123
aVand enrollment, bringing children into the schools.
p124
aVSo the government launched a whole host of programs
p125
aVto address these challenges,
p126
aVand the teachers became the implicit executors of these programs.
p127
aVNot explicitly, but implicitly.
p128
aVAnd now, what was actually needed was not to actually train teachers further
p129
aVor to monitor their attendance
p130
aVbut to tell them that what is most important
p131
aVis for them to go back inside classrooms and teach.
p132
aVThey needed to be monitored and measured and awarded
p133
aVon the quality of teaching
p134
aVand not on all sorts of other things.
p135
aa(lp136
VSo as we went through the education system,
p137
aVas we delved into it deeper, we found a few such core root causes
p138
aVwhich were determining, which were shaping how people behaved in the system.
p139
aVAnd we realized that unless we change those specific things,
p140
aVwe could do a number of other things.
p141
aVWe could train, we could put technology into schools,
p142
aVbut the system wouldn't change.
p143
aVAnd addressing these non-obvious core issues
p144
aVbecame a key part of the program.
p145
aa(lp146
VSo, we had the goal and we had the issues,
p147
aVand now we needed to figure out what the solutions were.
p148
aVWe obviously did not want to recreate the wheel,
p149
aVso we said, "Let's look around and see what we can find."
p150
aVAnd we found these beautiful, small pilot experiments
p151
aVall over the country and all over the world.
p152
aVSmall things being done by NGOs, being done by foundations.
p153
aVBut what was also interesting was that none of them actually scaled.
p154
aVAll of them were limited to 50, 100 or 500 schools.
p155
aVAnd here, we were looking for a solution for 15,000 schools.
p156
aa(lp157
VSo we looked into why,
p158
aVif these things actually work, why don't they actually scale?
p159
aVWhat happens is that when a typical NGO comes in,
p160
aVthey not only bring in their expertise
p161
aVbut they also bring in additional resources.
p162
aVSo they might bring in money,
p163
aVthey might bring in people,
p164
aVthey might bring in technology.
p165
aVAnd in the 50 or 100 schools that they actually operate in,
p166
aVthose additional resources actually create a difference.
p167
aVBut now imagine that the head of this NGO
p168
aVgoes to the head of the School Education Department
p169
aVand says, "Hey, now let's do this for 15,000 schools."
p170
aVWhere is that guy or girl going to find the money
p171
aVto actually scale this up to 15,000 schools?
p172
aVHe doesn't have the additional money,
p173
aVhe doesn't have the resources.
p174
aVAnd hence, innovations don't scale.
p175
aVSo right at the beginning of the project, what we said was,
p176
aV"Whatever we have to do has to be scalable,
p177
aVit has to work in all 15,000 schools."
p178
aVAnd hence, it has to work within the existing budgets
p179
aVand resources that the state actually has.
p180
aVMuch easier said than done.
p181
aV(Laughter)
p182
aa(lp183
VI think this was definitely the point in time
p184
aVwhen my team hated me.
p185
aVWe spent a lot of long hours in office, in cafés,
p186
aVsometimes even in bars,
p187
aVscratching out heads and saying,
p188
aV"Where are the solutions, how are we going to solve this problem?"
p189
aa(lp190
VIn the end, I think we did find solutions to many of the issues.
p191
aVI'll give you an example.
p192
aVIn the context of effective learning,
p193
aVone of the things people talk about is hands-on learning.
p194
aVChildren shouldn't memorize things from books,
p195
aVthey should do activities,
p196
aVand that's a more effective way to learn.
p197
aVWhich basically means giving students things
p198
aVlike beads, learning rods, abacuses.
p199
aVBut we did not have the budgets to give that
p200
aVto 15,000 schools, 2 million children.
p201
aVWe needed another solution.
p202
aVWe couldn't think of anything.
p203
aVOne day, one of our team members went to a school
p204
aVand saw a teacher pick up sticks and stones from the garden outside
p205
aVand take them into the classroom
p206
aVand give them to the students.
p207
aVThat was a huge eureka moment for us.
p208
aVSo what happens now in the textbooks in Haryana
p209
aVis that after every concept, we have a little box
p210
aVwhich are instructions for the teachers which say,
p211
aV"To teach this concept, here's an activity that you can do.
p212
aVAnd by the way, in order to actually do this activity,
p213
aVhere are things that you can use from your immediate environment,
p214
aVwhether it be the garden outside or the classroom inside,
p215
aVwhich can be used as learning aids for kids."
p216
aVAnd we see teachers all over Haryana
p217
aVusing lots of innovative things to be able to teach students.
p218
aVSo in this way, whatever we designed,
p219
aVwe were actually able to implement it
p220
aVacross all 15,000 schools from day one.
p221
aa(lp222
VNow, this brings me to my last point.
p223
aVHow do you implement something across 15,000 schools
p224
aVand 100,000 teachers?
p225
aVThe department used to have a process
p226
aVwhich is very interesting.
p227
aVI like to call it "The Chain of Hope."
p228
aVThey would write a letter from the headquarters
p229
aVand send it to the next level,
p230
aVwhich was the district offices.
p231
aVThey would hope that in each of these district offices,
p232
aVan officer would get the letter, would open it, read it
p233
aVand then forward it to the next level,
p234
aVwhich was the block offices.
p235
aVAnd then you would hope that at the block office,
p236
aVsomebody else got the letter,
p237
aVopened it, read it and forwarded it eventually to the 15,000 principals.
p238
aVAnd then one would hope that the principals
p239
aVgot the letter, received it, understood it
p240
aVand started implementing it.
p241
aVIt was a little bit ridiculous.
p242
aVNow, we knew technology was the answer,
p243
aVbut we also knew that most of these schools
p244
aVdon't have a computer or email.
p245
aVHowever, what the teachers do have are smartphones.
p246
aVThey're constantly on SMS, on Facebook and on WhatsApp.
p247
aa(lp248
VSo what now happens in Haryana is,
p249
aVall principals and teachers are divided into hundreds of WhatsApp groups
p250
aVand anytime something needs to be communicated,
p251
aVit's just posted across all WhatsApp groups.
p252
aVIt spreads like wildfire.
p253
aVYou can immediately check who has received it,
p254
aVwho has read it.
p255
aVTeachers can ask clarification questions instantaneously.
p256
aVAnd what's interesting is,
p257
aVit's not just the headquarters who are answering these questions.
p258
aVAnother teacher from a completely different part of the state
p259
aVwill stand up and answer the question.
p260
aVEverybody's acting as everybody's peer group,
p261
aVand things are getting implemented.
p262
aVSo today, when you go to a school in Haryana,
p263
aVthings look different.
p264
aVThe teachers are back inside classrooms,
p265
aVthey're teaching.
p266
aVOften with innovative techniques.
p267
aVWhen a supervisor comes to visit the classroom,
p268
aVhe or she not only checks the construction of the toilet
p269
aVbut also what is the quality of teaching.
p270
aVOnce a quarter, all students across the state
p271
aVare assessed on their learning outcomes
p272
aVand schools which are doing well are rewarded.
p273
aVAnd schools which are not doing so well
p274
aVfind themselves having difficult conversations.
p275
aVOf course, they also get additional support
p276
aVto be able to do better in the future.
p277
aVIn the context of education,
p278
aVit's very difficult to see results quickly.
p279
aa(lp280
VWhen people talk about systemic, large-scale change,
p281
aVthey talk about periods of 7 years and 10 years.
p282
aVBut not in Haryana.
p283
aVIn the last one year, there have been three independent studies,
p284
aVall measuring student learning outcomes,
p285
aVwhich indicate that something fundamental,
p286
aVsomething unique is happening in Haryana.
p287
aVLearning levels of children have stopped declining,
p288
aVand they have started going up.
p289
aVHaryana is one of the few states in the country
p290
aVwhich is showing an improvement,
p291
aVand certainly the one that is showing the fastest rate of improvement.
p292
aVThese are still early signs,
p293
aVthere's a long way to go,
p294
aVbut this gives us a lot of hope for the future.
p295
aVI recently went to a school,
p296
aVand as I was leaving,
p297
aVI ran into a lady,
p298
aVher name was Parvati,
p299
aVshe was the mother of a child,
p300
aVand she was smiling.
p301
aVAnd I said, "Why are you smiling, what's going on?"
p302
aVAnd she said, "I don't know what's going on,
p303
aVbut what I do know is that my children are learning,
p304
aVthey're having fun,
p305
aVand for the time being, I'll stop my search for a private school
p306
aVto send them to."
p307
aa(lp308
VSo I go back to where I started:
p309
aVCan government systems transform?
p310
aVI certainly believe so.
p311
aVI think if you give them the right levers,
p312
aVthey can move mountains.
