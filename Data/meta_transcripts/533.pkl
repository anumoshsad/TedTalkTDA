VWhat I want to do today is to spend
p4
aVsome time talking about some stuff that's
p5
aVsort of giving me a little bit of
p6
aVexistential angst, for lack of a better word,
p7
aVover the past couple of years, and
p8
aVbasically, these three quotes
p9
aVtell what's going on.
p10
aV"When God made the color purple,
p11
aVGod was just showing off," Alice Walker
p12
aVwrote in "The Color Purple," and
p13
aVZora Neale Hurston wrote in
p14
aV"Dust Tracks On A Road,"
p15
aV"Research is a formalized curiosity.
p16
aVIt's poking and prying with a purpose."
p17
aVAnd then finally,
p18
aVwhen I think about the near future,
p19
aVyou know, we have this attitude, well,
p20
aVwhatever happens, happens. Right?
p21
aVSo that goes along with the Chesire Cat
p22
aVsaying, "If you don't care much
p23
aVwhere you want to get to,
p24
aVit doesn't much matter which way you go."
p25
aVBut I think it does matter
p26
aVwhich way we go, and what road we take,
p27
aVbecause when I think about design in the
p28
aVnear future, what I think are the most
p29
aVimportant issues, what's really
p30
aVcrucial and vital is that we need
p31
aVto revitalize the arts and sciences
p32
aVright now in 2002.
p33
aV(Applause)
p34
aVIf we describe the near future
p35
aVas 10, 20, 15 years from now,
p36
aVthat means that what we do today
p37
aVis going to be critically important,
p38
aVbecause in the year 2015,
p39
aVand the year 2020, 2025, the world
p40
aVour society is going to be building on,
p41
aVthe basic knowledge and abstract ideas,
p42
aVthe discoveries that we came up with today,
p43
aVjust as all these wonderful things we're
p44
aVhearing about here at the TED conference
p45
aVthat we take for granted in the world
p46
aVright now, were really knowledge
p47
aVand ideas that came up
p48
aVin the '50s, the '60s, and the '70s.
p49
aVThat's the substrate that we're exploiting
p50
aVtoday, whether it's the internet,
p51
aVgenetic engineering, laser scanners,
p52
aVguided missiles, fiber optics, high-definition
p53
aVtelevision, sensing, remote-sensing
p54
aVfrom space and the wonderful
p55
aVremote-sensing photos that we see in
p56
aV3D weaving, TV programs like Tracker,
p57
aVand Enterprise, CD rewrite drives,
p58
aVflatscreen, Alvin Ailey's Suite Otis,
p59
aVor Sarah Jones' "Your Revolution Will Not
p60
aVBe Between These Thighs," which
p61
aVby the way was banned by the FCC,
p62
aVor ska, all of these things
p63
aVwithout question, almost without exception,
p64
aVare really based on ideas
p65
aVand abstract and creativity
p66
aVfrom years before,
p67
aVso we have to ask ourselves,
p68
aVwhat are we contributing to that legacy
p69
aVright now? And when I think about it,
p70
aVI'm really worried. To be quite frank,
p71
aVI'm concerned. I'm skeptical
p72
aVthat we're doing very much of anything.
p73
aVWe're, in a sense, failing to act
p74
aVin the future. We're purposefully,
p75
aVconsciously being laggards.
p76
aVWe're lagging behind.
p77
aVFrantz Fanon, who was a psychiatrist
p78
aVfrom Martinique, said, "Each generation
p79
aVmust, out of relative obscurity,
p80
aVdiscover its mission, and fulfill or betray it."
p81
aVWhat is our mission? What do we have
p82
aVto do? I think our mission is
p83
aVto reconcile, to reintegrate
p84
aVscience and the arts, because right now
p85
aVthere's a schism that exists
p86
aVin popular culture. You know,
p87
aVpeople have this idea that science
p88
aVand the arts are really separate.
p89
aVWe think of them as separate
p90
aVand different things, and this idea was
p91
aVprobably introduced centuries ago,
p92
aVbut it's really becoming critical now,
p93
aVbecause we're making decisions about our
p94
aVsociety every day that,
p95
aVif we keep thinking that the arts
p96
aVare separate from the sciences,
p97
aVand we keep thinking it's cute to say,
p98
aV"I don't understand anything about this one,
p99
aVI don't understand anything about the other
p100
aVone," then we're going to have problems.
p101
aVNow I know no one here at TED
p102
aVthinks this. All of us, we already know
p103
aVthat they're very connected, but I'm going
p104
aVto let you know that some folks
p105
aVin the outside world, believe it or not,
p106
aVthey think it's neat when they say,
p107
aV"You know, scientists and science is not
p108
aVcreative. Maybe scientists are ingenious,
p109
aVbut they're not creative.
p110
aVAnd then we have this tendency, the career
p111
aVcounselors and various people say things
p112
aVlike, "Artists are not analytical.
p113
aVThey're ingenious, perhaps,
p114
aVbut not analytical," and
p115
aVwhen these concepts underly our teaching
p116
aVand what we think about the world,
p117
aVthen we have a problem, because we
p118
aVstymie support for everything.
p119
aVBy accepting this dichotomy,
p120
aVwhether it's tongue-in-cheek, when
p121
aVwe attempt to accommodate it in our world,
p122
aVand we try to build our foundation
p123
aVfor the world, we're messing up the future,
p124
aVbecause, who wants to be uncreative?
p125
aVWho wants to be illogical?
p126
aVTalent would run from either of these fields
p127
aVif you said you had to choose either.
p128
aVThen they're going to go to something
p129
aVwhere they think, "Well, I can be creative
p130
aVand logical at the same time."
p131
aVNow I grew up in the '60s and I'll admit it,
p132
aVactually, my childhood spanned the '60s,
p133
aVand I was a wannabe hippie and I always
p134
aVresented the fact that I wasn't really
p135
aVold enough to be a hippie.
p136
aVAnd I know there are people here, the
p137
aVyounger generation who want to be hippies,
p138
aVbut people talk about the '60s all the time,
p139
aVand they talk about the anarchy
p140
aVthat was there, but when I think about
p141
aVthe '60s, what I took away from it was
p142
aVthat there was hope for the future.
p143
aVWe thought everyone could participate.
p144
aVThere were wonderful, incredible ideas
p145
aVthat were always percolating,
p146
aVand so much of what's cool or hot today
p147
aVis really based on some of those concepts,
p148
aVwhether it's, you know, people trying to
p149
aVuse the prime directive from Star Trek
p150
aVbeing involved in things, or again that
p151
aVthree-dimensional weaving and
p152
aVfax machines that I read about in my
p153
aVweekly readers that the technology
p154
aVand engineering was just getting started.
p155
aVBut the '60s left me with a problem.
p156
aVYou see, I always assumed I would go
p157
aVinto space, because I followed all of this,
p158
aVbut I also loved the arts and sciences.
p159
aVYou see, when I was growing up as
p160
aVa little girl and as a teenager,
p161
aVI loved designing and making dogs' clothes
p162
aVand wanting to be a fashion designer.
p163
aVI took art and ceramics. I loved dance.
p164
aVLola Falana. Alvin Ailey. Jerome Robbins.
p165
aVAnd I also avidly followed the Gemini
p166
aVand the Apollo programs.
p167
aVI had science projects and tons of astronomy
p168
aVbooks. I took calculus and philosophy.
p169
aVI wondered about the infinity
p170
aVand the Big Bang theory.
p171
aVAnd when I was at Stanford,
p172
aVI found myself, my senior year,
p173
aVchemical engineering major, half the folks
p174
aVthought I was a political science and
p175
aVperforming arts major, which was sort of
p176
aVtrue because I was Black Student Union President
p177
aVand I did major in some other things,
p178
aVand I found myself the last quarter juggling
p179
aVchemical engineering separation processes,
p180
aVlogic classes, nuclear magnetic resonance
p181
aVspectroscopy, and also producing
p182
aVand choreographing a dance production,
p183
aVand I had to do the lighting and the
p184
aVdesign work, and I was trying to figure out,
p185
aVdo I go to New York City
p186
aVto try to become a professional dancer,
p187
aVor do I go to medical school?
p188
aVNow, my mother helped me figure
p189
aVthat one out. (Laughter)
p190
aVBut when I went into space,
p191
aVwhen I went into space I carried a number
p192
aVof things up with me. I carried a poster
p193
aVby Alvin Ailey, which you can figure out
p194
aVnow, I love the dance company.
p195
aVAn Alvin Ailey poster of Judith Jamison
p196
aVperforming the dance "Cry," dedicated to all
p197
aVblack women everywhere. A Bundu statue,
p198
aVwhich was from the Women's Society
p199
aVin Sierra Leone, and a certificate for the
p200
aVChicago Public School students to work to
p201
aVimprove their science and math,
p202
aVand folks asked me,
p203
aV"Why did you take up what you took up?"
p204
aVAnd I had to say,
p205
aV"Because it represents human creativity,
p206
aVthe creativity that allowed us, that we were
p207
aVrequired to have to conceive and build
p208
aVand launch the space shuttle, springs from
p209
aVthe same source as the imagination and
p210
aVanalysis it took to carve a Bundu statue,
p211
aVor the ingenuity it took to design,
p212
aVchoreograph, and stage "Cry."
p213
aVEach one of them are different
p214
aVmanifestations, incarnations, of creativity,
p215
aVavatars of human creativity,
p216
aVand that's what we have to reconcile
p217
aVin our minds, how these things fit together.
p218
aVThe difference between arts and sciences
p219
aVis not analytical versus intuitive, right?
p220
aVE=MC squared required
p221
aVan intuitive leap, and then you had
p222
aVto do the analysis afterwards.
p223
aVEinstein said, in fact, "The most beautiful
p224
aVthing we can experience is the mysterious.
p225
aVIt is the source of all true art and science."
p226
aVDance requires us to express and want
p227
aVto express the jubilation in life, but then you
p228
aVhave to figure out, exactly
p229
aVwhat movement do I do to make sure
p230
aVthat it comes across correctly?
p231
aVThe difference between arts and sciences
p232
aVis also not constructive versus
p233
aVdeconstructive, right? A lot of people
p234
aVthink of the sciences as deconstructive.
p235
aVYou have to pull things apart.
p236
aVAnd yeah, sub-atomic physics
p237
aVis deconstructive. You literally try to
p238
aVtear atoms apart to understand
p239
aVwhat's inside of them. But sculpture, from
p240
aVwhat I understand from great sculptors,
p241
aVis deconstructive, because you see a piece
p242
aVand you remove what doesn't
p243
aVneed to be there.
p244
aVBiotechnology is constructive.
p245
aVOrchestral arranging is constructive.
p246
aVSo in fact we use constructive and
p247
aVdeconstructive techniques in everything.
p248
aVThe difference between science
p249
aVand the arts is not that they
p250
aVare different sides of the same coin, even,
p251
aVor even different parts
p252
aVof the same continuum, but rather
p253
aVthey're manifestations of the same thing.
p254
aVDifferent quantum states of an atom?
p255
aVOr maybe if I want to be more 21st century
p256
aVI could say that they are different harmonic
p257
aVresonances of a superstring.
p258
aVBut we'll leave that alone. (Laughter)
p259
aVThey spring from the same source.
p260
aVThe arts and sciences are avatars of
p261
aVhuman creativity. It's our attempt
p262
aVas humans to build an understanding
p263
aVof the universe, the world around us.
p264
aVIt's our attempt to influence things,
p265
aVthe universe internal to ourselves
p266
aVand external to us.
p267
aVThe sciences, to me, are manifestations
p268
aVof our attempt to express
p269
aVor share our understanding,
p270
aVour experience, to influence the universe
p271
aVexternal to ourselves.
p272
aVIt doesn't rely on us as individuals.
p273
aVIt's the universe, as experienced
p274
aVby everyone, and the arts manifest
p275
aVour desire, our attempt to share
p276
aVor influence others through experiences
p277
aVthat are peculiar to us as individuals.
p278
aVLet me say it again another way:
p279
aVscience provides an understanding
p280
aVof a universal experience, and
p281
aVarts provides a universal understanding
p282
aVof a personal experience.
p283
aVThat's what we have to think about,
p284
aVthat they're all part of us, they're
p285
aVall part of a continuum.
p286
aVIt's not just the tools, it's not just
p287
aVthe sciences, you know, the mathematics
p288
aVand the numerical stuff and the statistics,
p289
aVbecause we heard, very much on this
p290
aVstage, people talked about music
p291
aVbeing mathematical. Right? Arts don't just
p292
aVuse clay, aren't the only ones that use clay,
p293
aVlight and sound and movement.
p294
aVThey use analysis as well.
p295
aVSo people might say, well,
p296
aVI still like that intuitive versus analytical
p297
aVthing, because everybody wants to do the
p298
aVright brain, left brain thing, right?
p299
aVWe've all been accused of being
p300
aVright-brained or left-brained at some point
p301
aVin time, depending on who
p302
aVwe disagreed with. (Laughter)
p303
aVYou know, people say intuitive, you know
p304
aVthat's like you're in touch with nature,
p305
aVin touch with yourself and relationships.
p306
aVAnalytical: you put your mind to work, and
p307
aVI'm going to tell you a little secret. You all
p308
aVknow this though, but sometimes people
p309
aVuse this analysis idea, that things are
p310
aVoutside of ourselves, to be, say, that this
p311
aVis what we're going to elevate
p312
aVas the true, most important sciences, right?
p313
aVAnd then you have artists, and you all
p314
aVknow this is true as well,
p315
aVartists will say things about scientists
p316
aVbecause they say they're too concrete,
p317
aVthey're disconnected with the world.
p318
aVBut, we've even had that here on stage,
p319
aVso don't act like you don't know
p320
aVwhat I'm talking about. (Laughter)
p321
aVWe had folks talking about the Flat Earth
p322
aVSociety and flower arrangers, so there's
p323
aVthis whole dichotomy that we continue
p324
aVto carry along, even when we know better.
p325
aVAnd folks say we need to choose either or.
p326
aVBut it would really be foolish to choose
p327
aVeither one, right?
p328
aVIntuitive versus analytical?
p329
aVThat's a foolish choice. It's foolish,
p330
aVjust like trying to choose between
p331
aVbeing realistic or idealistic.
p332
aVYou need both in life. Why do people
p333
aVdo this? I'm just gonna quote
p334
aVa molecular biologist, Sydney Brenner,
p335
aVwho's 70 years old so he can say this. He said,
p336
aV"It's always important to distinguish
p337
aVbetween chastity and impotence."
p338
aVNow... (Laughter)
p339
aVI want to share with you
p340
aVa little equation, okay?
p341
aVHow do understanding science
p342
aVand the arts fit into our lives
p343
aVand what's going on and the things
p344
aVthat we're talking about here
p345
aVat the design conference, and this is
p346
aVa little thing I came up with, understanding
p347
aVand our resources and our will
p348
aVcause us to have outcomes.
p349
aVOur understanding is our science, our arts,
p350
aVour religion, how we see the universe
p351
aVaround us, our resources, our money,
p352
aVour labor, our minerals, those things
p353
aVthat are out there in the world we have
p354
aVto work with.
p355
aVBut more importantly, there's our will.
p356
aVThis is our vision, our aspirations
p357
aVof the future, our hopes, our dreams,
p358
aVour struggles and our fears.
p359
aVOur successes and our failures influence
p360
aVwhat we do with all of those, and to me,
p361
aVdesign and engineering, craftsmanship and
p362
aVskilled labor, are all the things that work on
p363
aVthis to have our outcome,
p364
aVwhich is our human quality of life.
p365
aVWhere do we want the world to be?
p366
aVAnd guess what?
p367
aVRegardless of how we look at this, whether
p368
aVwe look at arts and sciences are separate
p369
aVor different, they're both being influenced
p370
aVnow and they're both having problems.
p371
aVI did a project called S.E.E.ing the Future:
p372
aVScience, Engineering and Education, and
p373
aVit was looking at how to shed light on
p374
aVmost effective use of government funding.
p375
aVWe got a bunch of scientists in all stages
p376
aVof their careers. They came to Dartmouth
p377
aVCollege, where I was teaching, and they
p378
aVtalked about with theologians and financiers,
p379
aVwhat are some of the issues of public
p380
aVfunding for science and engineering
p381
aVresearch? What's most important about it?
p382
aVThere are some ideas that emerged that
p383
aVI think have really powerful parallels
p384
aVto the arts. The first thing they said was that
p385
aVthe circumstances that we find ourselves in
p386
aVtoday in the sciences and engineering that
p387
aVmade us world leaders is very different
p388
aVthan the '40s, the '50s, and the '60s
p389
aVand the '70s when we emerged
p390
aVas world leaders, because we're no longer
p391
aVin competition with fascism, with
p392
aVSoviet-style communism, and by the way
p393
aVthat competition wasn't just military,
p394
aVit included social competition
p395
aVand political competition as well,
p396
aVthat allowed us to look at space
p397
aVas one of those platforms to prove
p398
aVthat our social system was better.
p399
aVAnother thing they talked about was the
p400
aVinfrastructure that supports the sciences
p401
aVis becoming obsolete. We look at
p402
aVuniversities and colleges, small, mid-sized
p403
aVcommunity colleges across the country,
p404
aVtheir laboratories are becoming obsolete,
p405
aVand this is where we train most of our
p406
aVscience workers and our researchers,
p407
aVand our teachers, by the way,
p408
aVand then that there's a media that doesn't
p409
aVsupport the dissemination of any more than
p410
aVthe most mundane and inane of information.
p411
aVThere's pseudo-science, crop circles,
p412
aValien autopsy, haunted houses,
p413
aVor disasters. And that's what we see.
p414
aVAnd this isn't really the information
p415
aVyou need to operate in everyday life
p416
aVand figure out how to participate in this
p417
aVdemocracy and determine what's going on.
p418
aVThey also said that there's a change
p419
aVin the corporate mentality. Whereas
p420
aVgovernment money had always been there
p421
aVfor basic science and engineering research,
p422
aVwe also counted on some companies to do
p423
aVsome basic research, but what's happened
p424
aVnow is companies put more energy into
p425
aVshort-term product development
p426
aVthan they do in basic engineering
p427
aVand science research.
p428
aVAnd education is not keeping up.
p429
aVIn K through 12, people are taking out
p430
aVwet labs. They think if we put a computer
p431
aVin the room it's going to take the place
p432
aVof actually, we're mixing the acids,
p433
aVwe're growing the potatoes.
p434
aVAnd government funding is decreasing
p435
aVin spending and then they're saying,
p436
aVlet's have corporations take over,
p437
aVand that's not true. Government funding
p438
aVshould at least do things like recognize
p439
aVcost-benefits of basic science and
p440
aVengineering research. We have to know
p441
aVthat we have a responsibility
p442
aVas global citizens in this world.
p443
aVWe have to look at the education
p444
aVof humans. We need to build our resources
p445
aVtoday to make sure that they're trained so
p446
aVthat they understand the importance of
p447
aVthese things, and we have to support
p448
aVthe vitality of science, and that doesn't
p449
aVmean that everything has to have one thing
p450
aVthat's going to go on, or we know
p451
aVexactly what's going to be the outcome of it,
p452
aVbut that we support the vitality and the
p453
aVintellectual curiosity that goes along,
p454
aVand if you think about those parallels
p455
aVto the arts, the competition
p456
aVwith the Bolshoi Ballet spurred
p457
aVthe Joffrey and the New York City Ballet
p458
aVto become better.
p459
aVInfrastructure museums, theaters,
p460
aVmovie houses across the country
p461
aVare disappearing. We have more
p462
aVtelevision stations with less to watch,
p463
aVwe have more money spent on
p464
aVrewrites to get old television programs
p465
aVin the movies.
p466
aVWe have corporate funding now that,
p467
aVwhen it goes to some company, when it
p468
aVgoes to support the arts, it almost requires
p469
aVthat the product be part of the picture
p470
aVthat the artist draws, and we have
p471
aVstadiums that are named over and over
p472
aVagain by corporations.
p473
aVIn Houston, we're trying to figure out
p474
aVwhat to do with that Enron Stadium thing.
p475
aV(Laughter) And fine arts and education
p476
aVin the schools is disappearing, and we have
p477
aVa government that seems like it's gutting
p478
aVthe NEA and other programs,
p479
aVso we have to really stop and think,
p480
aVwhat are we trying to do
p481
aVwith the sciences and the arts?
p482
aVThere's a need to revitalize them.
p483
aVWe have to pay attention to it. I just want
p484
aVto tell you really quickly what I'm doing.
p485
aV(Applause)
p486
aVI want to tell you what I've been doing
p487
aVa little bit since... I feel this need
p488
aVto sort of integrate some of the ideas
p489
aVthat I've had and run across over time.
p490
aVOne of the things that I found out
p491
aVis that there's a need to repair
p492
aVthe dichotomy between the mind and body
p493
aVas well. My mother always told me,
p494
aVyou have to be observant, know what's
p495
aVgoing on in your mind and your body,
p496
aVand as a dancer I had this tremendous
p497
aVfaith in my ability to know my body,
p498
aVjust as I knew how to sense colors.
p499
aVThen I went to medical school, and I was
p500
aVsupposed to just go on
p501
aVwhat the machine said about bodies.
p502
aVYou know, you would ask patients
p503
aVquestions and some people would tell you,
p504
aV"Don't, don't, don't listen to what
p505
aVthe patients said." We know that patients
p506
aVknow and understand their bodies better,
p507
aVbut these days we're trying to divorce them
p508
aVfrom that idea. We have to reconcile the
p509
aVpatient's knowledge of their body
p510
aVwith physician's measurements.
p511
aVWe had someone talk about
p512
aVmeasuring emotions and getting machines
p513
aVto figure out what, to keep us
p514
aVfrom acting crazy. Right?
p515
aVNo, we shouldn't measure,
p516
aVwe shouldn't use machines
p517
aVto measure road rage and then do
p518
aVsomething to keep us from engaging in it.
p519
aVMaybe we can have machines help us
p520
aVto recognize that we have road rage and
p521
aVthen we need to know how to control that
p522
aVwithout the machines. We even need to be
p523
aVable to recognize that without the machines.
p524
aVWhat I'm very concerned about
p525
aVis how do we bolster our self-awareness
p526
aVas humans, as biological organisms?
p527
aVMichael Moschen spoke of having to teach
p528
aVand learn how to feel with my eyes,
p529
aVto see with my hands.
p530
aVWe have all kinds of possibilities to use
p531
aVour senses by, and that's
p532
aVwhat we have to do.
p533
aVThat's what I want to do, is to try to use
p534
aVbioinstrumentation, those kind of things
p535
aVto help our senses in what we do,
p536
aVand that's the work I've been doing now as
p537
aVa company called BioSentient Corporation.
p538
aVI figured I'd have to do that ad, because
p539
aVI'm an entrepreneur, because entrepreneur
p540
aVsays that that's somebody who does what
p541
aVthey want to do because they're not broke
p542
aVenough that they have to get a real job.
p543
aV(Laughter) But that's the work I'm doing
p544
aVwith BioSentient Corporation trying to figure
p545
aVout how do we integrate these things?
p546
aVLet me finish by saying that
p547
aVmy personal design issue for the future
p548
aVis really about integrating, to think about
p549
aVthat intuitive and that analytical.
p550
aVThe arts and sciences are not separate.
p551
aVHigh school physics lesson before you
p552
aVleave. High school physics teacher used to
p553
aVhold up a ball. She would say this ball
p554
aVhas potential energy, but nothing
p555
aVwill happen to it, it can't do any work
p556
aVuntil I drop it and it changes states.
p557
aVI like to think of ideas as potential energy.
p558
aVThey're really wonderful, but nothing
p559
aVwill happen until we risk
p560
aVputting them into action.
p561
aVThis conference is filled
p562
aVwith wonderful ideas.
p563
aVWe're going to share lots of things
p564
aVwith people, but nothing's going to happen
p565
aVuntil we risk putting those ideas into action.
p566
aVWe need to revitalize the arts and sciences
p567
aVof today, we need to take responsibility
p568
aVfor the future. We can't hide behind saying
p569
aVit's just for company profits,
p570
aVor it's just a business, or I'm an artist
p571
aVor an academician.
p572
aVHere's how you judge what you're doing.
p573
aVI talked about that balance between
p574
aVintuitive, analytical.
p575
aVFran Lebowitz, my favorite cynic,
p576
aVshe said the three questions
p577
aVof greatest concern, now I'm going to
p578
aVadd on to design, is,
p579
aV"Is it attractive?"
p580
aVThat's the intuitive.
p581
aV"Is it amusing?" The analytical.
p582
aV"And does it know its place?"
p583
aVThe balance. Thank you very much.
