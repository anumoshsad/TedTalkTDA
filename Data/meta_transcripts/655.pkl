VThe substance of things unseen.
p4
aVCities, past and future.
p5
aVIn Oxford, perhaps we can use Lewis Carroll
p6
aVand look in the looking glass that is New York City
p7
aVto try and see our true selves,
p8
aVor perhaps pass through to another world.
p9
aVOr, in the words of F. Scott Fitzgerald,
p10
aV"As the moon rose higher,
p11
aVthe inessential houses began to melt away
p12
aVuntil gradually I became aware of the old island
p13
aVhere that once flowered for Dutch sailors' eyes,
p14
aVa fresh green breast of the new world."
p15
aa(lp16
VMy colleagues and I have been working for 10 years
p17
aVto rediscover this lost world
p18
aVin a project we call The Mannahatta Project.
p19
aVWe're trying to discover what Henry Hudson would have seen
p20
aVon the afternoon of September 12th, 1609,
p21
aVwhen he sailed into New York harbor.
p22
aVAnd I'd like to tell you the story in three acts,
p23
aVand if I have time still, an epilogue.
p24
aa(lp25
VSo, Act I: A Map Found.
p26
aVSo, I didn't grow up in New York.
p27
aVI grew up out west in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, like you see here,
p28
aVin the Red Rock Canyon.
p29
aVAnd from these early experiences as a child
p30
aVI learned to love landscapes.
p31
aVAnd so when it became time for me to do my graduate studies,
p32
aVI studied this emerging field of landscape ecology.
p33
aVLandscape ecology concerns itself
p34
aVwith how the stream and the meadow and the forest and the cliffs
p35
aVmake habitats for plants and animals.
p36
aVThis experience and this training
p37
aVlead me to get a wonderful job with the Wildlife Conservation Society,
p38
aVwhich works to save wildlife and wild places all over the world.
p39
aVAnd over the last decade,
p40
aVI traveled to over 40 countries
p41
aVto see jaguars and bears and elephants
p42
aVand tigers and rhinos.
p43
aa(lp44
VBut every time I would return from my trips I'd return back to New York City.
p45
aVAnd on my weekends I would go up, just like all the other tourists,
p46
aVto the top of the Empire State Building,
p47
aVand I'd look down on this landscape, on these ecosystems,
p48
aVand I'd wonder, "How does this landscape
p49
aVwork to make habitat for plants and animals?
p50
aVHow does it work to make habitat for animals like me?"
p51
aVI'd go to Times Square and I'd look at the amazing ladies on the wall,
p52
aVand wonder why nobody is looking at the historical figures just behind them.
p53
aVI'd go to Central Park and see the rolling topography of Central Park
p54
aVcome up against the abrupt and sheer
p55
aVtopography of midtown Manhattan.
p56
aa(lp57
VI started reading about the history and the geography in New York City.
p58
aVI read that New York City was the first mega-city,
p59
aVa city of 10 million people or more, in 1950.
p60
aVI started seeing paintings like this.
p61
aVFor those of you who are from New York,
p62
aVthis is 125th street under the West Side Highway.
p63
aV(Laughter)
p64
aVIt was once a beach. And this painting
p65
aVhas John James Audubon, the painter, sitting on the rock.
p66
aVAnd it's looking up on the wooded heights of Washington Heights
p67
aVto Jeffrey's Hook, where the George Washington Bridge goes across today.
p68
aa(lp69
VOr this painting, from the 1740s, from Greenwich Village.
p70
aVThose are two students at King's College \u2014 later Columbia University \u2014
p71
aVsitting on a hill, overlooking a valley.
p72
aVAnd so I'd go down to Greenwich Village and I'd look for this hill,
p73
aVand I couldn't find it. And I couldn't find that palm tree.
p74
aVWhat's that palm tree doing there?
p75
aV(Laughter)
p76
aa(lp77
VSo, it was in the course of these investigations that I ran into a map.
p78
aVAnd it's this map you see here.
p79
aVIt's held in a geographic information system
p80
aVwhich allows me to zoom in.
p81
aVThis map isn't from Hudson's time, but from the American Revolution,
p82
aV170 years later, made by British military cartographers
p83
aVduring the occupation of New York City.
p84
aVAnd it's a remarkable map. It's in the National Archives here in Kew.
p85
aVAnd it's 10 feet long and three and a half feet wide.
p86
aa(lp87
VAnd if I zoom in to lower Manhattan
p88
aVyou can see the extent of New York City as it was,
p89
aVright at the end of the American Revolution.
p90
aVHere's Bowling Green. And here's Broadway.
p91
aVAnd this is City Hall Park.
p92
aVSo the city basically extended to City Hall Park.
p93
aVAnd just beyond it you can see features
p94
aVthat have vanished, things that have disappeared.
p95
aVThis is the Collect Pond, which was the fresh water source for New York City
p96
aVfor its first 200 years,
p97
aVand for the Native Americans for thousands of years before that.
p98
aVYou can see the Lispenard Meadows
p99
aVdraining down through here, through what is TriBeCa now,
p100
aVand the beaches that come up from the Battery,
p101
aVall the way to 42nd St.
p102
aa(lp103
VThis map was made for military reasons.
p104
aVThey're mapping the roads, the buildings, these fortifications
p105
aVthat they built.
p106
aVBut they're also mapping things of ecological interest,
p107
aValso military interest: the hills,
p108
aVthe marshes, the streams.
p109
aVThis is Richmond Hill, and Minetta Water,
p110
aVwhich used to run its way through Greenwich Village.
p111
aVOr the swamp at Gramercy Park, right here.
p112
aVOr Murray Hill. And this is the Murrays' house
p113
aVon Murray Hill, 200 years ago.
p114
aVHere is Times Square,
p115
aVthe two streams that came together to make a wetland
p116
aVin Times Square, as it was at the end of the American Revolution.
p117
aa(lp118
VSo I saw this remarkable map in a book.
p119
aVAnd I thought to myself, "You know, if I could georeference this map,
p120
aVif I could place this map in the grid of the city today,
p121
aVI could find these lost features
p122
aVof the city,
p123
aVin the block-by-block geography that people know,
p124
aVthe geography of where people go to work, and where they go to live,
p125
aVand where they like to eat."
p126
aVSo, after some work we were able to georeference it,
p127
aVwhich allows us to put the modern streets on the city,
p128
aVand the buildings, and the open spaces,
p129
aVso that we can zoom in to where the Collect Pond is.
p130
aVWe can digitize the Collect Pond and the streams,
p131
aVand see where they actually are in the geography of the city today.
p132
aVSo this is fun for finding where things are
p133
aVrelative to the old topography.
p134
aa(lp135
VBut I had another idea about this map.
p136
aVIf we take away the streets, and if we take away the buildings,
p137
aVand if we take away the open spaces,
p138
aVthen we could take this map.
p139
aVIf we pull off the 18th century features
p140
aVwe could drive it back in time.
p141
aVWe could drive it back to its ecological fundamentals:
p142
aVto the hills, to the streams,
p143
aVto the basic hydrology and shoreline, to the beaches,
p144
aVthe basic aspects that make the ecological landscape.
p145
aa(lp146
VThen, if we added maps like the geology, the bedrock geology,
p147
aVand the surface geology, what the glaciers leave,
p148
aVif we make the soil map,
p149
aVwith the 17 soil classes,
p150
aVthat are defined by the National Conservation Service,
p151
aVif we make a digital elevation model
p152
aVof the topography that tells us how high the hills were,
p153
aVthen we can calculate the slopes.
p154
aVWe can calculate the aspect.
p155
aVWe can calculate the winter wind exposure \u2014
p156
aVso, which way the winter winds blow across the landscape.
p157
aVThe white areas on this map are the places protected from the winter winds.
p158
aa(lp159
VWe compiled all the information about where the Native Americans were, the Lenape.
p160
aVAnd we built a probability map of where they might have been.
p161
aVSo, the red areas on this map indicate the places
p162
aVthat are best for human sustainability on Manhattan,
p163
aVplaces that are close to water,
p164
aVplaces that are near the harbor to fish,
p165
aVplaces protected from the winter winds.
p166
aVWe know that there was a Lenape settlement
p167
aVdown here by the Collect Pond.
p168
aVAnd we knew that they planted a kind of horticulture,
p169
aVthat they grew these beautiful gardens of corn, beans, and squash,
p170
aVthe "Three Sisters" garden.
p171
aa(lp172
VSo, we built a model that explains where those fields might have been.
p173
aVAnd the old fields, the successional fields that go.
p174
aVAnd we might think of these as abandoned.
p175
aVBut, in fact, they're grassland habitats
p176
aVfor grassland birds and plants.
p177
aVAnd they have become successional shrub lands,
p178
aVand these then mix in to a map of all the ecological communities.
p179
aVAnd it turns out that Manhattan had 55 different ecosystem types.
p180
aVYou can think of these as neighborhoods,
p181
aVas distinctive as TriBeCa and the Upper East Side and Inwood \u2014
p182
aVthat these are the forest and the wetlands
p183
aVand the marine communities, the beaches.
p184
aa(lp185
VAnd 55 is a lot. On a per-area basis,
p186
aVManhattan had more ecological communities
p187
aVper acre than Yosemite does,
p188
aVthan Yellowstone, than Amboseli.
p189
aVIt was really an extraordinary landscape
p190
aVthat was capable of supporting an extraordinary biodiversity.
p191
aa(lp192
VSo, Act II: A Home Reconstructed.
p193
aVSo, we studied the fish and the frogs and the birds and the bees,
p194
aVthe 85 different kinds of fish that were on Manhattan,
p195
aVthe Heath hens, the species that aren't there anymore,
p196
aVthe beavers on all the streams, the black bears,
p197
aVand the Native Americans, to study how they used
p198
aVand thought about their landscape.
p199
aVWe wanted to try and map these. And to do that what we did
p200
aVwas we mapped their habitat needs.
p201
aa(lp202
VWhere do they get their food?
p203
aVWhere do they get their water? Where do they get their shelter?
p204
aVWhere do they get their reproductive resources?
p205
aVTo an ecologist, the intersection of these is habitat,
p206
aVbut to most people, the intersection of these is their home.
p207
aVSo, we would read in field guides, the standard field guides
p208
aVthat maybe you have on your shelves,
p209
aVyou know, what beavers need is, "A slowly meandering stream
p210
aVwith aspen trees and alders and willows,
p211
aVnear the water." That's the best thing for a beaver.
p212
aa(lp213
VSo we just started making a list.
p214
aVHere is the beaver. And here is the stream,
p215
aVand the aspen and the alder and the willow.
p216
aVAs if these were the maps that we would need
p217
aVto predict where you would find the beaver.
p218
aVOr the bog turtle, needing wet meadows and insects and sunny places.
p219
aVOr the bobcat, needing rabbits and beavers and den sites.
p220
aVAnd rapidly we started to realize that beavers can be
p221
aVsomething that a bobcat needs.
p222
aVBut a beaver also needs things. And that having it
p223
aVon either side means that we can link it together,
p224
aVthat we can create the network
p225
aVof the habitat relationships for these species.
p226
aa(lp227
VMoreover, we realized that you can start out
p228
aVas being a beaver specialist,
p229
aVbut you can look up what an aspen needs.
p230
aVAn aspen needs fire and dry soils.
p231
aVAnd you can look at what a wet meadow needs.
p232
aVAnd it need beavers to create the wetlands,
p233
aVand maybe some other things.
p234
aVBut you can also talk about sunny places.
p235
aVSo, what does a sunny place need? Not habitat per se.
p236
aVBut what are the conditions that make it possible?
p237
aVOr fire. Or dry soils.
p238
aVAnd that you can put these on a grid that's 1,000 columns long
p239
aVacross the top and 1,000 rows down the other way.
p240
aVAnd then we can visualize this data like a network,
p241
aVlike a social network.
p242
aa(lp243
VAnd this is the network of all the habitat relationships
p244
aVof all the plants and animals on Manhattan,
p245
aVand everything they needed,
p246
aVgoing back to the geology,
p247
aVgoing back to time and space at the very core of the web.
p248
aVWe call this the Muir Web. And if you zoom in on it it looks like this.
p249
aVEach point is a different species
p250
aVor a different stream or a different soil type.
p251
aVAnd those little gray lines are the connections that connect them together.
p252
aVThey are the connections that actually make nature resilient.
p253
aVAnd the structure of this is what makes nature work,
p254
aVseen with all its parts.
p255
aVWe call these Muir Webs after the Scottish-American naturalist
p256
aVJohn Muir, who said, "When we try to pick out anything by itself,
p257
aVwe find that it's bound fast by a thousand invisible cords
p258
aVthat cannot be broken, to everything in the universe."
p259
aa(lp260
VSo then we took the Muir webs and we took them back to the maps.
p261
aVSo if we wanted to go between 85th and 86th,
p262
aVand Lex and Third,
p263
aVmaybe there was a stream in that block.
p264
aVAnd these would be the kind of trees that might have been there,
p265
aVand the flowers and the lichens and the mosses,
p266
aVthe butterflies, the fish in the stream,
p267
aVthe birds in the trees.
p268
aVMaybe a timber rattlesnake lived there.
p269
aVAnd perhaps a black bear walked by. And maybe Native Americans were there.
p270
aVAnd then we took this data.
p271
aa(lp272
VYou can see this for yourself on our website.
p273
aVYou can zoom into any block on Manhattan,
p274
aVand see what might have been there 400 years ago.
p275
aVAnd we used it to try and reveal a landscape
p276
aVhere in Act III.
p277
aVWe used the tools they use in Hollywood
p278
aVto make these fantastic landscapes that we all see in the movies.
p279
aa(lp280
VAnd we tried to use it to visualize Third Avenue.
p281
aVSo we would take the landscape and we would build up the topography.
p282
aVWe'd lay on top of that the soils and the waters, and illuminate the landscape.
p283
aVWe would lay on top of that the map of the ecological communities.
p284
aVAnd feed into that the map of the species.
p285
aVSo that we would actually take a photograph,
p286
aVflying above Times Square, looking toward the Hudson River,
p287
aVwaiting for Hudson to come.
p288
aVUsing this technology, we can make these
p289
aVfantastic georeferenced views.
p290
aVWe can basically take a picture out of any window
p291
aVon Manhattan and see what that landscape looked like 400 years ago.
p292
aa(lp293
VThis is the view from the East River, looking up Murray Hill
p294
aVat where the United Nations is today.
p295
aVThis is the view looking down the Hudson River,
p296
aVwith Manhattan on the left, and New Jersey out on the right,
p297
aVlooking out toward the Atlantic Ocean.
p298
aVThis is the view over Times Square,
p299
aVwith the beaver pond there, looking out toward the east.
p300
aVSo we can see the Collect Pond, and Lispenard Marshes back behind.
p301
aVWe can see the fields that the Native Americans made.
p302
aVAnd we can see this in the geography of the city today.
p303
aVSo when you're watching "Law and Order," and the lawyers walk up the steps
p304
aVthey could have walked back down those steps
p305
aVof the New York Court House, right into the Collect Pond,
p306
aV400 years ago.
p307
aa(lp308
VSo these images are the work of my friend and colleague,
p309
aVMark Boyer, who is here in the audience today.
p310
aVAnd I'd just like, if you would give him a hand,
p311
aVto call out for his fine work.
p312
aV(Applause)
p313
aa(lp314
VThere is such power in bringing science and visualization together,
p315
aVthat we can create images like this,
p316
aVperhaps looking on either side of a looking glass.
p317
aVAnd even though I've only had a brief time to speak,
p318
aVI hope you appreciate that Mannahatta was a very special place.
p319
aVThe place that you see here on the left side
p320
aVwas interconnected. It was based on this diversity.
p321
aVIt had this resilience that is what we need in our modern world.
p322
aa(lp323
VBut I wouldn't have you think that I don't like the place
p324
aVon the right, which I quite do. I've come to love the city
p325
aVand its kind of diversity, and its resilience,
p326
aVand its dependence on density and how we're connected together.
p327
aVIn fact, that I see them as reflections of each other,
p328
aVmuch as Lewis Carroll did in "Through the Looking Glass."
p329
aVWe can compare these two and hold them in our minds at the same time,
p330
aVthat they really are the same place,
p331
aVthat there is no way that cities can escape from nature.
p332
aVAnd I think this is what we're learning about building cities in the future.
p333
aa(lp334
VSo if you'll allow me a brief epilogue, not about the past,
p335
aVbut about 400 years from now,
p336
aVwhat we're realizing is that
p337
aVcities are habitats for people,
p338
aVand need to supply what people need:
p339
aVa sense of home, food, water, shelter,
p340
aVreproductive resources, and a sense of meaning.
p341
aVThis is the particular additional habitat requirement of humanity.
p342
aVAnd so many of the talks here at TED are about meaning,
p343
aVabout bringing meaning to our lives
p344
aVin all kinds of different ways, through technology,
p345
aVthrough art, through science,
p346
aVso much so that I think we focus so much on
p347
aVthat side of our lives, that we haven't given enough
p348
aVattention to the food and the water and the shelter,
p349
aVand what we need to raise the kids.
p350
aa(lp351
VSo, how can we envision the city of the future?
p352
aVWell, what if we go to Madison Square Park,
p353
aVand we imagine it without all the cars,
p354
aVand bicycles instead
p355
aVand large forests, and streams instead of sewers and storm drains?
p356
aVWhat if we imagined the Upper East Side
p357
aVwith green roofs, and streams winding through the city,
p358
aVand windmills supplying the power we need?
p359
aVOr if we imagine the New York City metropolitan area,
p360
aVcurrently home to 12 million people,
p361
aVbut 12 million people in the future, perhaps living at the density of Manhattan,
p362
aVin only 36 percent of the area,
p363
aVwith the areas in between covered by farmland,
p364
aVcovered by wetlands,
p365
aVcovered by the marshes we need.
p366
aa(lp367
VThis is the kind of future I think we need,
p368
aVis a future that has the same diversity
p369
aVand abundance and dynamism of Manhattan,
p370
aVbut that learns from the sustainability of the past,
p371
aVof the ecology, the original ecology, of nature with all its parts.
p372
aVThank you very much.
