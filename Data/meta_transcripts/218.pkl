aa(lp7
VThank you. Ooh, I'm like, "Phew, phew, calm down. Get back into my body now." (Laughter)
p8
aa(lp9
VUsually when I play out, the first thing that happens is
p10
aVpeople scream out, "What's she doing?!"
p11
aVI'll play at these rock shows, be on stage
p12
aVstanding completely still, and they're like,
p13
aV"What's she doing?! What's she doing?!"
p14
aVAnd then I'll kind of be like \u2014 (Vvvwow!) \u2014 and then they're like, "Whoa!"
p15
aV(Laughter)
p16
aa(lp17
VI'm sure you're trying to figure out,
p18
aV"Well, how does this thing work?"
p19
aVWell, what I'm doing is
p20
aVcontrolling the pitch with my left hand.
p21
aVSee, the closer I get to this antenna, the higher the note gets \u2014
p22
aV(Portamento) \u2014
p23
aVand you can get it really low.
p24
aVAnd with this hand I'm controlling the volume,
p25
aVso the further away my right hand gets, the louder it gets.
p26
aV(Tones)
p27
aVSo basically, with both of your hands
p28
aVyou're controlling pitch and volume and kind of
p29
aVtrying to create the illusion that you're doing separate notes,
p30
aVwhen really it's continuously going ...
p31
aV(Flourish ... Beep)
p32
aV(Laughter)
p33
aa(lp34
VSometimes I startle myself: I'll forget that I have it on,
p35
aVand I'll lean over to pick up something,
p36
aVand then it goes like \u2014 (Blip) \u2014 "Oh!"
p37
aVAnd it's like a funny sound effect that follows you around
p38
aVif you don't turn the thing off.
p39
aV(Laughter)
p40
aa(lp41
VMaybe we'll go into the next tune,
p42
aVbecause I totally lost where this is going.
p43
aVWe're going to do a song by David Mash called "Listen: the Words Are Gone,"
p44
aVand maybe I'll have words come back into me afterwards if I can relax.

aa(lp50
VSo, I'm trying to think of some of the questions
p51
aVthat are commonly asked; there are so many.
p52
aVAnd ... Well, I guess I could tell you
p53
aVa little of the history of the theremin.
p54
aVIt was invented around the 1920s, and the inventor, Léon Theremin
p55
aV\u2014 he also was a musician besides an inventor \u2014
p56
aVhe came up with the idea for making the theremin,
p57
aVI think, when he was working on some shortwave radios.
p58
aVAnd there'd be that sound in the signal \u2014 it's like (Screeching) \u2014
p59
aVand he thought, "Oh, what if I could control that sound
p60
aVand turn it into an instrument, because there are pitches in it."
p61
aVAnd so somehow through developing that,
p62
aVhe eventually came to make the theremin the way it is now.
p63
aa(lp64
VAnd a lot of times, even kids nowadays,
p65
aVthey'll make reference to a theremin by going, "Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo,"
p66
aVbecause in the '50s it was used in the sci-fi horror movies,
p67
aVthat sound that's like ... (Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo)
p68
aV(Laughter)
p69
aVIt's kind of a funny, goofy sound to do.
p70
aa(lp71
VAnd sometimes if I have too much coffee,
p72
aVthen my vibrato gets out of hand.
p73
aVYou're really sensitive to your body and its functions
p74
aVwhen you're behind this thing.
p75
aVYou have to stay so still if you want to have the most control.
p76
aVIt reminds me of the balancing act earlier on \u2014 what Michael was doing \u2014
p77
aVbecause you're fighting so hard to keep the balance
p78
aVwith what you're playing with and stay in tune, and at the same time
p79
aVyou don't want to focus so much on being in tune all the time;
p80
aVyou want to be feeling the music.
p81
aa(lp82
VAnd then also, you're trying to stay very, very, very still
p83
aVbecause little movements with other parts of your body
p84
aVwill affect the pitch, or sometimes if you're holding a low note \u2014 (Tone rising out of key) \u2014
p85
aVand breathing will make it ...
p86
aa(lp87
V(Laughter)
p88
aa(lp89
VIf I pass out on the next song ...
p90
aV(Laughter)
p91
aa(lp92
VI think of it almost like
p93
aVlike a yoga instrument because it makes you so aware
p94
aVof every little crazy thing your body is doing,
p95
aVor just aware of what you don't want it to be doing
p96
aVwhile you're playing; you don't want to have any sudden movements.
p97
aVAnd if I go to a club and play a gig, people are like,
p98
aV"Here, have some drinks on us!"
p99
aVAnd it's like, "Well, I'm about to go on soon;
p100
aVI don't want to be like \u2014 (Teetering tones) \u2014 you know?"
p101
aa(lp102
VIt really does reflect the mood that you're in also,
p103
aVif you're ...
p104
aVit's similar to being a vocalist, except
p105
aVinstead of it coming out of your throat,
p106
aVyou're controlling it just in the air
p107
aVand you don't really have a point of reference;
p108
aVyou're always relying on your ears and adjusting constantly.
p109
aVYou just have to always adjust to what's happening
p110
aVand realize you'll have bummer notes come here and there
p111
aVand listen to it, adjust it, and just move on,
p112
aVor else you'll get too tied up and go crazy. Like me.
p113
aa(lp114
VI think we will play another tune now.
p115
aVI'm going to do "Lush Life." It's one of my favorite tunes to play.
