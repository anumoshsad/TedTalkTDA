VSo I am a pediatric cancer doctor
p4
aVand stem-cell researcher at Stanford University
p5
aVwhere my clinical focus has been bone marrow transplantation.
p6
aVNow, inspired by Jill Bolte Taylor last year,
p7
aVI didn't bring a human brain,
p8
aVbut I did bring a liter of bone marrow.
p9
aVAnd bone marrow is actually what we use
p10
aVto save the lives of tens of thousands of patients,
p11
aVmost of whom have advanced malignancies like leukemia and lymphoma
p12
aVand some other diseases.
p13
aa(lp14
VSo, a few years ago, I'm doing my transplant fellowship at Stanford.
p15
aVI'm in the operating room. We have Bob here,
p16
aVwho is a volunteer donor.
p17
aVWe're sending his marrow across the country to save the life
p18
aVof a child with leukemia.
p19
aVSo actually how do we harvest this bone marrow?
p20
aVWell we have a whole O.R. team, general anesthesia, nurses,
p21
aVand another doctor across from me.
p22
aVBob's on the table, and we take this sort of small needle,
p23
aVyou know, not too big.
p24
aVAnd the way we do this is we basically
p25
aVplace this through the soft tissue,
p26
aVand kind of punch it into the hard bone,
p27
aVinto the tuchus \u2014 that's a technical term \u2014
p28
aVand aspirate about 10 mls of bone marrow out,
p29
aVeach time, with a syringe.
p30
aVAnd hand it off to the nurse. She squirts it into a tin.
p31
aVHands it back to me. And we do that again and again.
p32
aVAbout 200 times usually.
p33
aVAnd by the end of this my arm is sore, I've got a callus on my hand,
p34
aVlet alone Bob,
p35
aVwhose rear end looks something more like this,
p36
aVlike Swiss cheese.
p37
aa(lp38
VSo I'm thinking, you know, this procedure hasn't changed in about 40 years.
p39
aVAnd there is probably a better way to do this.
p40
aVSo I thought of a minimally invasive approach,
p41
aVand a new device that we call the Marrow Miner.
p42
aVThis is it.
p43
aVAnd the Marrow Miner, the way it works is shown here.
p44
aa(lp45
VOur standard see-through patient.
p46
aVInstead of entering the bone dozens of times,
p47
aVwe enter just once, into the front of the hip or the back of the hip.
p48
aVAnd we have a flexible, powered catheter
p49
aVwith a special wire loop tip that stays inside the crunchy part of the marrow
p50
aVand follows the contours of the hip, as it moves around.
p51
aVSo it enables you to very rapidly aspirate,
p52
aVor suck out, rich bone marrow very quickly through one hole.
p53
aVWe can do multiple passes through that same entry.
p54
aVNo robots required.
p55
aVAnd, so, very quickly, Bob can just get one puncture, local anesthesia,
p56
aVand do this harvest as an outpatient.
p57
aa(lp58
VSo I did a few prototypes. I got a small little grant at Stanford.
p59
aVAnd played around with this a little bit.
p60
aVAnd our team members developed this technology.
p61
aVAnd eventually we got two large animals, and pig studies.
p62
aVAnd we found, to our surprise, that we not only got bone marrow out,
p63
aVbut we got 10 times the stem cell activity
p64
aVin the marrow from the Marrow Miner, compared to the normal device.
p65
aVThis device was just FDA approved in the last year.
p66
aa(lp67
VHere is a live patient. You can see it following the flexible curves around.
p68
aVThere will be two passes here, in the same patient, from the same hole.
p69
aVThis was done under local anesthesia, as an outpatient.
p70
aVAnd we got, again, about three to six times more stem cells
p71
aVthan the standard approach done on the same patient.
p72
aa(lp73
VSo why should you care? Bone marrow is a very rich source of adult stem cells.
p74
aVYou all know about embryonic stem cells.
p75
aVThey've got great potential but haven't yet entered clinical trials.
p76
aVAdult stem cells are throughout our body,
p77
aVincluding the blood-forming stem cells in our bone marrow,
p78
aVwhich we've been using as a form of stem-cell therapy
p79
aVfor over 40 years.
p80
aVIn the last decade there's been an explosion of use
p81
aVof bone marrow stem cells to treat the patient's other diseases
p82
aVsuch as heart disease, vascular disease,
p83
aVorthopedics, tissue engineering,
p84
aVeven in neurology to treat Parkinson's
p85
aVand diabetes.
p86
aa(lp87
VWe've just come out, we're commercializing, this year,
p88
aVgeneration 2.0 of the Marrow Miner.
p89
aVThe hope is that this gets more stem cells out,
p90
aVwhich translates to better outcomes.
p91
aVIt may encourage more people to sign up to be
p92
aVpotential live-saving bone marrow donors.
p93
aVIt may even enable you to bank
p94
aVyour own marrow stem cells, when you're younger and healthier,
p95
aVto use in the future should you need it.
p96
aVAnd ultimately \u2014 and here's a picture of our
p97
aVbone marrow transplant survivors,
p98
aVwho come together for a reunion each year at Stanford.
p99
aVHopefully this technology will let us
p100
aVhave more of these survivors in the future.
p101
aVThanks.
