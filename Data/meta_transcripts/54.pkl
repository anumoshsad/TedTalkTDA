VI'm going to take you on a journey very quickly.
p4
aVTo explain the wish, I'm going to have to take you somewhere
p5
aVwhere many people haven't been, and that's around the world.
p6
aVWhen I was about 24 years old, Kate Stohr and myself started an organization
p7
aVto get architects and designers involved in humanitarian work,
p8
aVnot only about responding to natural disasters,
p9
aVbut involved in systemic issues.
p10
aVWe believe that where the resources and expertise are scarce,
p11
aVinnovative, sustainable design can really make a difference in people's lives.
p12
aa(lp13
VSo I started my life as an architect, or training as an architect,
p14
aVand I was always interested in socially responsible design,
p15
aVand how you can really make an impact.
p16
aVBut when I went to architecture school,
p17
aVit seemed that I was a black sheep in the family.
p18
aVMany architects seemed to think that when you design,
p19
aVyou design a jewel, and it's a jewel that you try and crave for;
p20
aVwhereas I felt that when you design,
p21
aVyou either improve or you create a detriment
p22
aVto the community in which you're designing.
p23
aVSo you're not just doing a building for the residents
p24
aVor for the people who are going to use it, but for the community as a whole.
p25
aa(lp26
VAnd in 1999, we started by responding to the issue of the housing crisis
p27
aVfor returning refugees in Kosovo.
p28
aVAnd I didn't know what I was doing \u2014 like I said, mid-20s \u2014
p29
aVand I'm the Internet generation, so we started a website.
p30
aVWe put a call out there, and to my surprise, in a couple of months,
p31
aVwe had hundreds of entries from around the world.
p32
aVThat led to a number of prototypes being built
p33
aVand really experimenting with some ideas.
p34
aVTwo years later we started doing a project
p35
aVon developing mobile health clinics in sub-Saharan Africa,
p36
aVresponding to the HIV/AIDS pandemic.
p37
aVThat led to 550 entries from 53 countries.
p38
aVWe also have designers from around the world that participate.
p39
aVAnd we had an exhibit of work that followed that.
p40
aV2004 was the tipping point for us.
p41
aVWe started responding to natural disasters
p42
aVand getting involved in Iran, in Bam,
p43
aValso following up on our work in Africa.
p44
aa(lp45
VWorking within the United States \u2014
p46
aVmost people look at poverty and they see the face of a foreigner.
p47
aVBut I live in Bozeman, Montana \u2014
p48
aVgo up to the north plains on the reservations,
p49
aVor go down to Alabama or Mississippi, pre-Katrina,
p50
aVand I could have shown you places that have far worse conditions
p51
aVthan many developing countries that I've been to.
p52
aVSo we got involved in and worked in inner cities and elsewhere;
p53
aa(lp54
Vand also, I will go into some more projects.
p55
aV2005: Mother Nature kicked our ass.
p56
aVI think we can pretty much assume that 2005 was a horrific year
p57
aVwhen it comes to natural disasters.
p58
aVAnd because of the Internet,
p59
aVand because of connections to blogs and so forth,
p60
aVwithin literally hours of the tsunami, we were already raising funds,
p61
aVgetting involved, working with people on the ground.
p62
aVWe run from a couple of laptops, and in the first couple of days,
p63
aVI had 4,000 emails from people needing help.
p64
aVSo we began to get involved in projects there,
p65
aVand I'll talk about some others.
p66
aVAnd then of course, this year we've been responding to Katrina,
p67
aVas well as following up on our reconstruction work.
p68
aa(lp69
VSo this is a brief overview.
p70
aVIn 2004, I really couldn't manage the number of people who wanted to help,
p71
aVor the number of requests that I was getting.
p72
aVIt was all coming into my laptop and cell phone.
p73
aVSo we decided to embrace an open-source model of business \u2014
p74
aVso that anyone, anywhere in the world, could start a local chapter,
p75
aVand they can get involved in local problems.
p76
aVBecause I believe there is no such thing as Utopia.
p77
aVAll problems are local. All solutions are local.
p78
aVSo that means, you know, somebody who's based in Mississippi
p79
aVknows more about Mississippi than I do.
p80
aVSo what happened is, we used Meetup and all these other Internet tools,
p81
aVand we ended up having 40 chapters starting up,
p82
aVthousands of architects in 104 countries.
p83
aVSo the bullet point \u2014 sorry, I never do a suit,
p84
aVso I knew that I was going to take this off.
p85
aVOK, because I'm going to do it very quick.
p86
aa(lp87
VThis isn't just about nonprofit.
p88
aVWhat it showed me is that there's a grassroots movement going on,
p89
aVof socially responsible designers who really believe
p90
aVthat this world has got a lot smaller, and that we have the opportunity \u2014
p91
aVnot the responsibility, but the opportunity \u2014
p92
aVto really get involved in making change.
p93
aa(lp94
V(Laughter)
p95
aa(lp96
V(Laughter)
p97
aa(lp98
VI'm adding that to my time.
p99
aa(lp100
V(Laughter)
p101
aa(lp102
VSo what you don't know is,
p103
aVwe've got these thousands of designers working around the world,
p104
aVconnected basically by a website, and we have a staff of three.
p105
aVThe fact that nobody told us we couldn't do it, we did it.
p106
aVAnd so there's something to be said about naïveté.
p107
aVSo seven years later, we've developed
p108
aVso that we've got advocacy, instigation and implementation.
p109
aVWe advocate for good design, not only through student workshops
p110
aVand lectures and public forums, op-eds;
p111
aVwe have a book on humanitarian work;
p112
aVbut also disaster mitigation and dealing with public policy.
p113
aVWe can talk about FEMA, but that's another talk.
p114
aVInstigation, developing ideas with communities and NGOs,
p115
aVdoing open-source design competitions.
p116
aVReferring, matchmaking with communities.
p117
aVAnd then implementing \u2014 actually going out there and doing the work,
p118
aVbecause when you invent, it's never a reality until it's built.
p119
aVSo it's really important that if we're designing
p120
aVand trying to create change, we build that change.
p121
aa(lp122
VSo here's a select number of projects.
p123
aVKosovo.
p124
aVThis is Kosovo in '99.
p125
aVWe did an open design competition, like I said.
p126
aVIt led to a whole variety of ideas.
p127
aVAnd this wasn't about emergency shelter,
p128
aVbut transitional shelter that would last five to 10 years,
p129
aVthat would be placed next to the land the resident lived in,
p130
aVand that they would rebuild their own home.
p131
aVThis wasn't imposing an architecture on a community;
p132
aVthis was giving them the tools and the space
p133
aVto allow them to rebuild and regrow the way they want to.
p134
aVWe had from the sublime to the ridiculous, but they worked.
p135
aVThis is an inflatable hemp house. It was built; it works.
p136
aa(lp137
VThis is a shipping container.
p138
aVBuilt and works.
p139
aVAnd a whole variety of ideas
p140
aVthat not only dealt with architectural building,
p141
aVbut also the issues of governance,
p142
aVand the idea of creating communities through complex networks.
p143
aa(lp144
VSo we've engaged not just designers,
p145
aVbut also a whole variety of technology-based professionals.
p146
aVUsing rubble from destroyed homes to create new homes.
p147
aVUsing straw bale construction, creating heat walls.
p148
aVAnd then something remarkable happened in '99.
p149
aa(lp150
VWe went to Africa originally to look at the housing issue.
p151
aVWithin three days, we realized the problem was not housing;
p152
aVit was the growing pandemic of HIV/AIDS.
p153
aVAnd it wasn't doctors telling us this;
p154
aVit was actual villagers that we were staying with.
p155
aVAnd so we came up with the bright idea
p156
aVthat instead of getting people to walk 10, 15 kilometers to see doctors,
p157
aVyou get the doctors to the people.
p158
aVAnd we started engaging the medical community,
p159
aVand you know, we thought we were real bright sparks \u2014
p160
aV"We've come up with this great idea:
p161
aVmobile health clinics, widely distributed throughout sub-Saharan Africa."
p162
aVAnd the medical community there said,
p163
aV"We've said this for the last decade.
p164
aVWe know this. We just don't know how to show this."
p165
aVSo in a way, we had taken pre-existing needs and shown solutions.
p166
aVAnd so again, we had a whole variety of ideas that came in.
p167
aa(lp168
VThis one I personally love,
p169
aVbecause the idea is that architecture is not just about solutions,
p170
aVbut about raising awareness.
p171
aVThis is a kenaf clinic.
p172
aVYou get seed and you grow it in a plot of land,
p173
aVand it grows 14 feet in a month.
p174
aVAnd on the fourth week, the doctors come and they mow out an area,
p175
aVput a tensile structure on the top,
p176
aVand when the doctors have finished treating
p177
aVand seeing patients and villagers,
p178
aVyou cut down the clinic and you eat it.
p179
aVIt's an eat-your-own-clinic.
p180
aa(lp181
VSo it's dealing with the fact that if you have AIDS,
p182
aVyou also need to have nutrition rates,
p183
aVand the idea of nutrition is as important
p184
aVas getting antiretrovirals out there.
p185
aVSo you know, this is a serious solution.
p186
aVThis one I love.
p187
aVThe idea is it's not just a clinic, it's a community center.
p188
aVThis looked at setting up trade routes
p189
aVand economic engines within the community,
p190
aVso it can be a self-sustaining project.
p191
aa(lp192
VEvery one of these projects is sustainable.
p193
aVThat's not because I'm a tree-hugging green person.
p194
aVIt's because when you live on four dollars a day,
p195
aVyou're living on survival and you have to be sustainable.
p196
aVYou have to know where your energy is coming from,
p197
aVyou have to know where your resource is coming from,
p198
aVand you have to keep the maintenance down.
p199
aVSo this is about getting an economic engine,
p200
aVand then at night, it turns into a movie theater.
p201
aVSo it's not an AIDS clinic. It's a community center.
p202
aVSo you can see ideas.
p203
aVAnd these ideas developed into prototypes,
p204
aVand they were eventually built.
p205
aVAnd currently, as of this year,
p206
aVthere are clinics rolling out in Nigeria and Kenya.
p207
aa(lp208
VFrom that, we also developed Siyathemba.
p209
aVThe community came to us and said,
p210
aV"The problem is that the girls don't have education."
p211
aVAnd we're working in an area
p212
aVwhere young women between the ages of 16 and 24
p213
aVhave a 50 percent HIV/AIDS rate.
p214
aVAnd that's not because they're promiscuous,
p215
aVit's because there's no knowledge.
p216
aa(lp217
VAnd so we decided to look at the idea of sports,
p218
aVand create a youth sports center
p219
aVthat doubled as an HIV/AIDS outreach center,
p220
aVand the coaches of the girls' team were also trained doctors.
p221
aVSo that there would be a very slow way of developing confidence in health care.
p222
aVAnd we picked nine finalists,
p223
aVand then those nine finalists were distributed throughout the entire region,
p224
aVand then the community picked their design.
p225
aVThey said, this is our design,
p226
aVbecause it's not only about engaging a community;
p227
aVit's about empowering a community,
p228
aVand about getting them to be a part of the rebuilding process.
p229
aa(lp230
VSo, the winning design is here.
p231
aVAnd then, of course, we actually go and work
p232
aVwith the community and the clients.
p233
aa(lp234
VSo this is the designer.
p235
aVHe's out there working with the first ever women's soccer team
p236
aVin KwaZulu-Natal, Siyathemba.
p237
aVAnd they can tell it better.
p238
aa(lp239
V(A cappella singing in a South African language)
p240
aa(lp241
VVideo: Well, my name is Cee Cee Mkhonza.
p242
aVI work at the Africa Centre, I'm an IT user consultant.
p243
aVI'm also the national football player for South Africa, Banyana Banyana.
p244
aVAnd I also play in the Vodacom League, for the team called Tembisa,
p245
aVwhich has now changed to Siyathemba.
p246
aVThis is our home ground.
p247
aa(lp248
VCameron Sinclair: I'm going to show that later because I'm running out of time.
p249
aVI can see Chris looking at me slyly.
p250
aa(lp251
VThis was a connection, just a meeting with somebody
p252
aVwho wanted to develop Africa's first telemedicine center, in Tanzania.
p253
aVAnd we met, literally, a couple of months ago.
p254
aVWe've already developed a design.
p255
aVThe team is over there, working in partnership.
p256
aVThis was a matchmaking, thanks to a couple of TEDsters \u2014
p257
aVSun [Microsystems], Cheryl Heller and Andrew Zolli,
p258
aVwho connected me with this amazing African woman.
p259
aVAnd we start construction in June, and it will be opened by TEDGlobal.
p260
aVSo when you come to TEDGlobal, you can check it out.
p261
aa(lp262
VBut what we're known probably most for is dealing with disasters and development,
p263
aVand we've been involved in a lot of issues,
p264
aVsuch as the tsunami and also things like Hurricane Katrina.
p265
aVThis is a 370-dollar shelter that can be easily assembled.
p266
aVThis is a community-designed community center.
p267
aVAnd what that means is we actually live and work with the community,
p268
aVand they're part of the design process.
p269
aVThe kids actually get involved in mapping out
p270
aVwhere the community center should be.
p271
aVAnd then eventually, the community, through skills training,
p272
aVend up building the building with us.
p273
aa(lp274
VHere is another school.
p275
aVThis is what the UN gave these guys for six months \u2014 12 plastic tarps.
p276
aVThis was in August.
p277
aVThis was the replacement; that's supposed to last for two years.
p278
aVWhen the rain comes down, you can't hear a thing,
p279
aVand in the summer, it's about 140 degrees inside.
p280
aVSo we said, if the rain's coming down, let's get fresh water.
p281
aVSo every one of our schools has a rainwater collection system.
p282
aVVery low cost: three classrooms and rainwater collection is 5,000 dollars.
p283
aVThis was raised by hot chocolate sales in Atlanta.
p284
aVIt's built by the parents of the kids.
p285
aVThe kids are out there on-site, building the buildings.
p286
aVAnd it opened a couple of weeks ago,
p287
aVand there's 600 kids that are now using the schools.
p288
aa(lp289
V(Applause)
p290
aa(lp291
VSo, disaster hits home.
p292
aVWe see the bad stories on CNN and Fox and all that,
p293
aVbut we don't see the good stories.
p294
aVHere is a community that got together, and they said "no" to waiting.
p295
aVThey formed a partnership, a diverse partnership of players,
p296
aVto actually map out East Biloxi,
p297
aVto figure out who's getting involved.
p298
aVWe've had over 1,500 volunteers rebuilding, rehabbing homes.
p299
aVFiguring out what FEMA regulations are,
p300
aVnot waiting for them to dictate to us how you should rebuild.
p301
aVWorking with residents,
p302
aVgetting them out of their homes, so they don't get ill.
p303
aVThis is what they're cleaning up on their own.
p304
aVDesigning housing.
p305
aVThis house is going in in a couple of weeks.
p306
aVThis is a rehabbed home, done in four days.
p307
aVThis is a utility room for a woman who is on a walker.
p308
aVShe's 70 years old. This is what FEMA gave her.
p309
aV600 bucks, happened two days ago.
p310
aVWe put together, very quickly, a washroom.
p311
aVIt's built, it's running and she just started a business today,
p312
aVwhere she's washing other people's clothes.
p313
aa(lp314
VThese are the Calhouns.
p315
aVThey're photographers who had documented the Lower Ninth for the last 40 years.
p316
aVThat was their home, and these are the photographs they took.
p317
aVAnd we're helping, working with them to create a new building.
p318
aVProjects we've done.
p319
aVProjects we've been a part of, support.
p320
aVWhy don't aid agencies do this?
p321
aVThis is the UN tent.
p322
aVThis is the new UN tent, just introduced this year.
p323
aVQuick to assemble.
p324
aVIt's got a flap \u2014 that's the invention.
p325
aVIt took 20 years to design this and get it implemented in the field.
p326
aVI was 12 years old.
p327
aVThere's a problem here.
p328
aa(lp329
VLuckily, we're not alone.
p330
aVThere are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
p331
aVand hundreds of architects and designers and inventors
p332
aVaround the world that are getting involved in humanitarian work.
p333
aVMore hemp houses \u2014 it's a theme in Japan, apparently.
p334
aVI'm not sure what they're smoking.
p335
aa(lp336
V(Laughter)
p337
aa(lp338
VThis is a Grip Clip, designed by somebody who said,
p339
aV"All you need is some way to attach membrane structures
p340
aVto physical support beams."
p341
aVThis guy designed for NASA, is now doing housing.
p342
aVI'm going to whip through this quickly,
p343
aVbecause I know I've got only a couple of minutes.
p344
aa(lp345
VSo this is all done in the last two years.
p346
aVI showed you something that took 20 years to do.
p347
aVAnd this is just a selection of things
p348
aVthat were built in the last couple of years.
p349
aVFrom Brazil to India,
p350
aVMexico,
p351
aVAlabama,
p352
aVChina,
p353
aVIsrael,
p354
aVPalestine,
p355
aVVietnam.
p356
aa(lp357
VThe average age of a designer who gets involved in this project is 32 \u2014
p358
aVthat's how old I am.
p359
aVSo it's a young \u2014
p360
aVI just have to stop here, because Arup is in the room,
p361
aVand this is the best-designed toilet in the world.
p362
aVIf you're ever, ever in India, go use this toilet.
p363
aa(lp364
V(Laughter)
p365
aa(lp366
VChris Luebkeman will tell you why.
p367
aVI'm sure that's how he wanted to spend the party.
p368
aVBut the future is not going to be the sky-scraping cities of New York,
p369
aVbut this.
p370
aVAnd when you look at this, you see crisis.
p371
aVWhat I see is many, many inventors.
p372
aVOne billion people live in abject poverty.
p373
aVWe hear about them all the time.
p374
aVFour billion live in growing but fragile economies.
p375
aVOne in seven live in unplanned settlements.
p376
aVIf we do nothing about the housing crisis that's about to happen,
p377
aVin 20 years, one in three people will live in an unplanned settlement
p378
aVor a refugee camp.
p379
aVLook left, look right: one of you will be there.
p380
aVHow do we improve the living standards of five billion people?
p381
aVWith 10 million solutions.
p382
aa(lp383
VSo I wish to develop a community
p384
aVthat actively embraces innovative and sustainable design
p385
aVto improve the living conditions for everyone.
p386
aa(lp387
VChris Anderson: Wait a sec \u2014 that's your wish?
p388
aa(lp389
VCS: That's my wish.
p390
aa(lp391
VCA: That's his wish!
p392
aa(lp393
V(Applause)
p394
aa(lp395
VCS: We started Architecture for Humanity with 700 dollars and a website.
p396
aVSo Chris somehow decided to give me 100,000.
p397
aVSo why not this many people?
p398
aVOpen-source architecture is the way to go.
p399
aVYou have a diverse community of participants \u2014
p400
aVand we're not just talking about inventors and designers,
p401
aVbut we're talking about the funding model.
p402
aVMy role is not as a designer;
p403
aVit's as a conduit between the design world and the humanitarian world.
p404
aVAnd what we need is something that replicates me globally,
p405
aVbecause I haven't slept in seven years.
p406
aa(lp407
V(Laughter)
p408
aa(lp409
VSecondly, what will this thing be?
p410
aVDesigners want to respond to issues of humanitarian crisis,
p411
aVbut they don't want some company in the West
p412
aVtaking their idea and basically profiting from it.
p413
aVSo Creative Commons has developed the Developing Nations license.
p414
aVAnd what that means is that a designer can \u2014
p415
aVThe Siyathemba project I showed
p416
aVwas the first ever building to have a Creative Commons license on it.
p417
aVAs soon as that is built, anyone in Africa or any developing nation
p418
aVcan take the construction documents and replicate it for free.
p419
aa(lp420
V(Applause)
p421
aa(lp422
VSo why not allow designers the opportunity to do this,
p423
aVbut still protect their rights here?
p424
aVWe want to have a community where you can upload ideas,
p425
aVand those ideas can be tested in an earthquake, in flood,
p426
aVin all sorts of austere environments.
p427
aVThe reason that's important
p428
aVis I don't want to wait for the next Katrina
p429
aVto find out if my house works.
p430
aVThat's too late, we need to do it now.
p431
aVSo doing that globally \u2014
p432
aVand I want this whole thing to work multi-lingually.
p433
aVWhen you look at the face of an architect, most people think a gray-haired white guy.
p434
aVI don't see that; I see the face of the world.
p435
aVSo I want everyone from all over the planet
p436
aVto be able to be a part of this design and development.
p437
aVThe idea of needs-based competitions \u2014
p438
aVXPRIZE for the other 98 percent, if you want to call it that.
p439
aa(lp440
VWe also want to look at ways of matchmaking
p441
aVand putting funding partners together,
p442
aVand the idea of integrating manufacturers \u2014
p443
aVfab labs in every country.
p444
aVWhen I hear about the $100 laptop and it's going to educate every child \u2014
p445
aVeducate every designer in the world.
p446
aVPut one in every favela, every slum settlement.
p447
aVBecause you know what? Innovation will happen.
p448
aVAnd I need to know that. It's called the leap-back.
p449
aVWe talk about leapfrog technologies.
p450
aa(lp451
VI write with Worldchanging,
p452
aVand the one thing we've been talking about is,
p453
aVI learn more on the ground than I've ever learned here.
p454
aVSo let's take those ideas, adapt them, and we can use them.
p455
aVThese ideas are supposed to be adaptable;
p456
aVthey should have the potential for evolution;
p457
aVthey should be developed by every nation in the world
p458
aVand useful for every nation in the world.
p459
aVWhat will it take?
p460
aa(lp461
VThere should be a sheet.
p462
aVI don't have time to read this, because I'm going to be yanked off.
p463
aa(lp464
VCA: Let's just leave it up for a sec.
p465
aa(lp466
VCS: Well, what will it take? You guys are smart.
p467
aVSo it's going to take a lot of computing power,
p468
aVbecause I want the idea that any laptop anywhere in the world
p469
aVcan plug into the system
p470
aVand be able to not only participate in developing these designs,
p471
aVbut utilize the designs.
p472
aVAlso, a process of reviewing the designs.
p473
aVI want every Arup engineer in the world to check and make sure
p474
aVthat we're doing stuff that's standing,
p475
aVbecause those guys are the best in the world.
p476
aVPlug.
p477
aVAnd so, you know, I want these \u2014
p478
aa(lp479
VI just should note: I have two laptops and one of them is there,
p480
aVand that has 3000 designs on it.
p481
aVIf I drop that laptop ...
p482
aVWhat happens?
p483
aVSo it's important to have these proven ideas put up there,
p484
aVeasy to use, easy to get ahold of.
p485
aVMy mom once said, "There's nothing worse than being all mouth and no trousers."
p486
aa(lp487
V(Laughter)
p488
aa(lp489
VI'm fed up of talking about making change.
p490
aVYou only make it by doing it.
p491
aVWe've changed FEMA guidelines; we've changed public policy;
p492
aVwe've changed international response \u2014 based on building things.
p493
aVSo for me, it's important that we create a real conduit for innovation,
p494
aVand that it's free innovation.
p495
aVThink of free culture \u2014 this is free innovation.
p496
aVSomebody said this a couple of years back.
p497
aVI will give points for those who know it.
p498
aVBut I think the man was maybe 25 years too early.
p499
aa(lp500
VSo let's do it.
p501
aa(lp502
VThank you.
