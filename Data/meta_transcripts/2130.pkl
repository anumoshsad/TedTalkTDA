VWhat has the War on Drugs  done to the world?
p4
aVLook at the murder and mayhem in Mexico,
p5
aVCentral America, so many  other parts of the planet,
p6
aVthe global black market estimated
p7
aVat 300 billion dollars a year,
p8
aVprisons packed in the  United States and elsewhere,
p9
aVpolice and military drawn  into an unwinnable war
p10
aVthat violates basic rights,  and ordinary citizens
p11
aVjust hope they don't get  caught in the crossfire,
p12
aVand meanwhile, more people using
p13
aVmore drugs than ever.
p14
aVIt's my country's history  with alcohol prohibition
p15
aVand Al Capone, times 50.
p16
aa(lp17
VWhich is why it's  particularly galling to me
p18
aVas an American that we've  been the driving force
p19
aVbehind this global drug war.
p20
aVAsk why so many countries criminalize
p21
aVdrugs they'd never heard of,
p22
aVwhy the U.N. drug treaties emphasize
p23
aVcriminalization over health,
p24
aVeven why most of the money worldwide
p25
aVfor dealing with drug abuse goes not
p26
aVto helping agencies but those that punish,
p27
aVand you'll find the good old U.S. of A.
p28
aa(lp29
VWhy did we do this?
p30
aVSome people, especially in Latin America,
p31
aVthink it's not really about drugs.
p32
aVIt's just a subterfuge for advancing
p33
aVthe realpolitik interests of the U.S.
p34
aVBut by and large, that's not it.
p35
aVWe don't want gangsters and guerrillas
p36
aVfunded with illegal drug money
p37
aVterrorizing and taking over other nations.
p38
aVNo, the fact is, America really is crazy
p39
aVwhen it comes to drugs.
p40
aVI mean, don't forget, we're  the ones who thought
p41
aVthat we could prohibit alcohol.
p42
aVSo think about our global drug war
p43
aVnot as any sort of rational policy,
p44
aVbut as the international projection
p45
aVof a domestic psychosis.
p46
aV(Applause)
p47
aa(lp48
VBut here's the good news.
p49
aVNow it's the Russians leading the Drug War and not us.
p50
aVMost politicians in my country
p51
aVwant to roll back the Drug War now,
p52
aVput fewer people behind bars, not more,
p53
aVand I'm proud to say as an American
p54
aVthat we now lead the world
p55
aVin reforming marijuana policies.
p56
aVIt's now legal for medical purposes
p57
aVin almost half our 50 states,
p58
aVmillions of people can  purchase their marijuana,
p59
aVtheir medicine, in government- licensed dispensaries,
p60
aVand over half my fellow  citizens now say it's time
p61
aVto legally regulate and tax marijuana
p62
aVmore or less like alcohol.
p63
aVThat's what Colorado and  Washington are doing,
p64
aVand Uruguay, and others  are sure to follow.
p65
aa(lp66
VSo that's what I do:
p67
aVwork to end the Drug War.
p68
aVI think it all started growing up
p69
aVin a fairly religious, moral family,
p70
aVeldest son of a rabbi,
p71
aVgoing off to university where I
p72
aVsmoked some marijuana
p73
aVand I liked it. (Laughter)
p74
aVAnd I liked drinking too, but it was obvious
p75
aVthat alcohol was really the more dangerous of the two,
p76
aVbut my friends and I could get busted
p77
aVfor smoking a joint.
p78
aa(lp79
VNow, that hypocrisy kept bugging me,
p80
aVso I wrote my Ph.D dissertation on international drug control.
p81
aVI talked my way into the State Department.
p82
aVI got a security clearance.
p83
aVI interviewed hundreds of DEA and other law enforcement agents
p84
aVall around Europe and the Americas,
p85
aVand I'd ask them,
p86
aV"What do you think the answer is?"
p87
aVWell, in Latin America, they'd say to me,
p88
aV"You can't really cut off the supply.
p89
aVThe answer lies back in the U.S.,
p90
aVin cutting off the demand."
p91
aVSo then I go back home and I talk to people
p92
aVinvolved in anti-drug efforts there, and they'd say,
p93
aV"You know, Ethan, you can't  really cut off the demand.
p94
aVThe answer lies over there. You've got to cut off the supply."
p95
aVThen I'd go and talk  to the guys in customs
p96
aVtrying to stop drugs at the borders,
p97
aVand they'd say, "You're  not going to stop it here.
p98
aVThe answer lies over there,
p99
aVin cutting off supply and demand."
p100
aVAnd it hit me:
p101
aVEverybody involved in this
p102
aVthought the answer lay in that area
p103
aVabout which they knew the least.
p104
aa(lp105
VSo that's when I started  reading everything I could
p106
aVabout psychoactive drugs:  the history, the science,
p107
aVthe politics, all of it,
p108
aVand the more one read,
p109
aVthe more it hit you how a thoughtful,
p110
aVenlightened, intelligent  approach took you over here,
p111
aVwhereas the politics and laws of my country
p112
aVwere taking you over here.
p113
aVAnd that disparity struck me as this incredible
p114
aVintellectual and moral puzzle.
p115
aa(lp116
VThere's probably never been
p117
aVa drug-free society.
p118
aVVirtually every society
p119
aVhas ingested psychoactive substances
p120
aVto deal with pain, increase  our energy, socialize,
p121
aVeven commune with God.
p122
aVOur desire to alter our consciousness
p123
aVmay be as fundamental as our desires
p124
aVfor food, companionship and sex.
p125
aVSo our true challenge
p126
aVis to learn how to live with drugs
p127
aVso they cause the least possible harm
p128
aVand in some cases the  greatest possible benefit.
p129
aa(lp130
VI'll tell you something else I learned,
p131
aVthat the reason some drugs  are legal and others not
p132
aVhas almost nothing to do  with science or health
p133
aVor the relative risk of drugs,
p134
aVand almost everything to do with who uses
p135
aVand who is perceived  to use particular drugs.
p136
aVIn the late 19th century,
p137
aVwhen most of the drugs that are now illegal were legal,
p138
aVthe principal consumers  of opiates in my country
p139
aVand others were middle-aged white women,
p140
aVusing them to alleviate aches and pains
p141
aVwhen few other analgesics were available.
p142
aVAnd nobody thought about  criminalizing it back then
p143
aVbecause nobody wanted to  put Grandma behind bars.
p144
aVBut when hundreds of thousands of Chinese
p145
aVstarted showing up in my country,
p146
aVworking hard on the railroads and the mines
p147
aVand then kicking back in the evening
p148
aVjust like they had in the old country
p149
aVwith a few puffs on that opium pipe,
p150
aVthat's when you saw the  first drug prohibition laws
p151
aVin California and Nevada,
p152
aVdriven by racist fears of Chinese
p153
aVtransforming white women
p154
aVinto opium-addicted sex slaves.
p155
aVThe first cocaine prohibition  laws, similarly prompted
p156
aVby racist fears of black men  sniffing that white powder
p157
aVand forgetting their proper place
p158
aVin Southern society.
p159
aVAnd the first marijuana prohibition laws,
p160
aVall about fears of Mexican migrants
p161
aVin the West and the Southwest.
p162
aVAnd what was true in my country,
p163
aVis true in so many others as well,
p164
aVwith both the origins of these laws
p165
aVand their implementation.
p166
aVPut it this way,
p167
aVand I exaggerate only slightly:
p168
aVIf the principal smokers of cocaine
p169
aVwere affluent older white men
p170
aVand the principal consumers of Viagra
p171
aVwere poor young black men,
p172
aVthen smokable cocaine would be easy to get with a prescription from your doctor
p173
aVand selling Viagra would get you  five to 10 years behind bars.
p174
aV(Applause)
p175
aa(lp176
VI used to be a professor teaching about this.
p177
aVNow I'm an activist, a human rights activist,
p178
aVand what drives me is my shame
p179
aVat living in an otherwise great nation
p180
aVthat has less than five percent of the world's population
p181
aVbut almost 25 percent of the world's incarcerated population.
p182
aVIt's the people I meet  who have lost someone
p183
aVthey love to drug-related  violence or prison
p184
aVor overdose or AIDS
p185
aVbecause our drug policies emphasize
p186
aVcriminalization over health.
p187
aVIt's good people who have lost their jobs,
p188
aVtheir homes, their freedom,  even their children
p189
aVto the state, not because they hurt anyone
p190
aVbut solely because they chose to use one drug
p191
aVinstead of another.
p192
aa(lp193
VSo is legalization the answer?
p194
aVOn that, I'm torn:
p195
aVthree days a week I think yes, three days a week I think no,
p196
aVand on Sundays I'm agnostic.
p197
aVBut since today is Tuesday,
p198
aVlet me just say that legally  regulating and taxing
p199
aVmost of the drugs that  are now criminalized
p200
aVwould radically reduce  the crime, violence,
p201
aVcorruption and black markets,
p202
aVand the problems of adulterated and unregulated drugs,
p203
aVand improve public safety,
p204
aVand allow taxpayer resources to be developed
p205
aVto more useful purposes.
p206
aVI mean, look, the markets  in marijuana, cocaine,
p207
aVheroin and methamphetamine
p208
aVare global commodities markets
p209
aVjust like the global markets  in alcohol, tobacco,
p210
aVcoffee, sugar, and so many other things.
p211
aVWhere there is a demand,
p212
aVthere will be a supply.
p213
aVKnock out one source and another
p214
aVinevitably emerges.
p215
aVPeople tend to think of prohibition
p216
aVas the ultimate form of regulation
p217
aVwhen in fact it represents  the abdication of regulation
p218
aVwith criminals filling the void.
p219
aVWhich is why putting criminal laws and police
p220
aVfront and center in trying to control
p221
aVa dynamic global commodities market
p222
aVis a recipe for disaster.
p223
aVAnd what we really need to do
p224
aVis to bring the underground drug markets
p225
aVas much as possible aboveground
p226
aVand regulate them as  intelligently as we can
p227
aVto minimize both the harms of drugs
p228
aVand the harms of prohibitionist policies.
p229
aa(lp230
VNow, with marijuana, that obviously means
p231
aVlegally regulating and  taxing it like alcohol.
p232
aVThe benefits of doing so are enormous, the risks minimal.
p233
aVWill more people use marijuana?
p234
aVMaybe, but it's not  going to be young people,
p235
aVbecause it's not going to  be legalized for them,
p236
aVand quite frankly, they already have
p237
aVthe best access to marijuana.
p238
aVI think it's going to be older people.
p239
aVIt's going to be people in their 40s and 60s
p240
aVand 80s who find they prefer a little marijuana
p241
aVto that drink in the evening or the sleeping pill
p242
aVor that it helps with  their arthritis or diabetes
p243
aVor maybe helps spice up a  long-term marriage. (Laughter)
p244
aVAnd that just might be a  net public health benefit.
p245
aa(lp246
VAs for the other drugs,
p247
aVlook at Portugal, where  nobody goes to jail
p248
aVfor possessing drugs,
p249
aVand the government's made  a serious commitment
p250
aVto treating addiction as a health issue.
p251
aVLook at Switzerland,  Germany, the Netherlands,
p252
aVDenmark, England, where people who have
p253
aVbeen addicted to heroin for many years
p254
aVand repeatedly tried to quit and failed
p255
aVcan get pharmaceutical  heroin and helping services
p256
aVin medical clinics, and  the results are in:
p257
aVIllegal drug abuse and disease
p258
aVand overdoses and crime  and arrests all go down,
p259
aVhealth and well-being improve,
p260
aVtaxpayers benefit,
p261
aVand many drug users even put their addictions behind them.
p262
aa(lp263
VLook at New Zealand, which  recently enacted a law
p264
aVallowing certain recreational  drugs to be sold legally
p265
aVprovided their safety had been established.
p266
aVLook here in Brazil, and some other countries,
p267
aVwhere a remarkable psychoactive substance,
p268
aVayahuasca, can be legally  bought and consumed
p269
aVprovided it's done so  within a religious context.
p270
aVLook in Bolivia and Peru,
p271
aVwhere all sorts of products  made from the coca leaf,
p272
aVthe source of cocaine,
p273
aVare sold legally over the counter
p274
aVwith no apparent harm to people's public health.
p275
aVI mean, don't forget, Coca-Cola had cocaine in it until 1900,
p276
aVand so far as we know was no more addictive
p277
aVthan Coca-Cola is today.
p278
aa(lp279
VConversely, think about cigarettes:
p280
aVNothing can both hook you  and kill you like cigarettes.
p281
aVWhen researchers ask heroin addicts
p282
aVwhat's the toughest drug to  quit, most say cigarettes.
p283
aVYet in my country and many others,
p284
aVhalf of all the people who  were ever addicted
p285
aVto cigarettes have quit
p286
aVwithout anyone being  arrested or put in jail
p287
aVor sent to a "treatment program"
p288
aVby a prosecutor or a judge.
p289
aVWhat did it were higher taxes
p290
aVand time and place  restrictions on sale and use
p291
aVand effective anti-smoking campaigns.
p292
aVNow, could we reduce smoking even more
p293
aVby making it totally illegal? Probably.
p294
aVBut just imagine the drug war nightmare
p295
aVthat would result.
p296
aa(lp297
VSo the challenges we face today
p298
aVare twofold.
p299
aVThe first is the policy challenge
p300
aVof designing and implementing alternatives
p301
aVto ineffective prohibitionist policies,
p302
aVeven as we need to get  better at regulating
p303
aVand living with the drugs  that are now legal.
p304
aVBut the second challenge is tougher,
p305
aVbecause it's about us.
p306
aVThe obstacles to reform  lie not just out there
p307
aVin the power of the  prison industrial complex
p308
aVor other vested interests  that want to keep things
p309
aVthe way they are,
p310
aVbut within each and every one of us.
p311
aVIt's our fears and our lack of knowledge
p312
aVand imagination that stands  in the way of real reform.
p313
aVAnd ultimately, I think that  boils down to the kids,
p314
aVand to every parent's desire to put our baby in a bubble,
p315
aVand the fear that somehow drugs will pierce that bubble
p316
aVand put our young ones at risk.
p317
aVIn fact, sometimes it  seems like the entire
p318
aVWar on Drugs gets justified
p319
aVas one great big child protection act,
p320
aVwhich any young person  can tell you it's not.
p321
aa(lp322
VSo here's what I say to teenagers.
p323
aVFirst, don't do drugs.
p324
aVSecond, don't do drugs.
p325
aVThird, if you do do drugs,
p326
aVthere's some things I want you to know,
p327
aVbecause my bottom line as your parent is,
p328
aVcome home safely at the end of the night
p329
aVand grow up and lead a  healthy and good adulthood.
p330
aVThat's my drug education  mantra: Safety first.
p331
aa(lp332
VSo this is what I've dedicated my life to,
p333
aVto building an organization and a movement
p334
aVof people who believe we  need to turn our backs
p335
aVon the failed prohibitions of the past
p336
aVand embrace new drug  policies grounded in science,
p337
aVcompassion, health and human rights,
p338
aVwhere people who come from across the political spectrum
p339
aVand every other spectrum as well,
p340
aVwhere people who love our drugs,
p341
aVpeople who hate drugs,
p342
aVand people who don't give  a damn about drugs,
p343
aVbut every one of us believes  that this War on Drugs,
p344
aVthis backward, heartless,  disastrous War on Drugs,
p345
aVhas got to end.
p346
aa(lp347
VThank you.
p348
aa(lp349
V(Applause)
p350
aa(lp351
VThank you. Thank you.
p352
aa(lp353
VChris Anderson: Ethan,
p354
aVcongrats \u2014 quite the reaction.
p355
aVThat was a powerful talk.
p356
aVNot quite a complete standing O, though,
p357
aVand I'm guessing that some people here
p358
aVand maybe a few watching online,
p359
aVmaybe someone knows a teenager or a friend
p360
aVor whatever who got sick,
p361
aVmaybe died from some drug overdose.
p362
aVI'm sure you've had these people approach you before.
p363
aVWhat do you say to them?
p364
aa(lp365
VEthan Nadelmann: Chris, the most amazing thing that's happened of late
p366
aVis that I've met a growing number of people
p367
aVwho have actually  lost a sibling or a child
p368
aVto a drug overdose,
p369
aVand 10 years ago, those  people just wanted to say,
p370
aVlet's line up all the drug  dealers and shoot them
p371
aVand that will solve it.
p372
aVAnd what they've come to understand
p373
aVis that the Drug War did  nothing to protect their kids.
p374
aVIf anything, it made it more likely
p375
aVthat those kids were put at risk.
p376
aVAnd so they're now becoming part of this
p377
aVdrug policy reform movement.
p378
aVThere's other people who have kids,
p379
aVone's addicted to alcohol, the other one's addicted to cocaine or heroin,
p380
aVand they ask themselves the question:
p381
aVWhy does this kid get to  take one step at a time
p382
aVand try to get better
p383
aVand that one's got to deal with jail
p384
aVand police and criminals all the time?
p385
aVSo everybody's understanding,
p386
aVthe Drug War's not protecting anybody.
p387
aa(lp388
VCA: Certainly in the U.S.,  you've got political gridlock
p389
aVon most issues.
p390
aVIs there any realistic chance of anything
p391
aVactually shifting on this  issue in the next five years?
p392
aa(lp393
VEN: I'd say it's quite remarkable.  I'm getting all these calls
p394
aVfrom journalists now who are saying to me,
p395
aV"Ethan, it seems like the only two issues
p396
aVadvancing politically in America right now
p397
aVare marijuana law reform and gay marriage.
p398
aVWhat are you doing right?"
p399
aVAnd then you're looking at  bipartisanship breaking out
p400
aVwith, actually, Republicans in the Congress
p401
aVand state legislatures  allowing bills to be enacted
p402
aVwith majority Democratic support,
p403
aVso we've gone from being sort of the third rail,
p404
aVthe most fearful issue of American politics,
p405
aVto becoming one of the most successful.
p406
aa(lp407
VCA: Ethan, thank you so much for coming to TEDGlobal. EN: Chris, thanks so much.
