VThis is Pleurobot.
p4
aVPleurobot is a robot that we designed to closely mimic a salamander species
p5
aVcalled Pleurodeles waltl.
p6
aVPleurobot can walk, as you can see here,
p7
aVand as you'll see later, it can also swim.
p8
aa(lp9
VSo you might ask, why did we design this robot?
p10
aVAnd in fact, this robot has been designed as a scientific tool for neuroscience.
p11
aVIndeed, we designed it together with neurobiologists
p12
aVto understand how animals move,
p13
aVand especially how the spinal cord controls locomotion.
p14
aVBut the more I work in biorobotics,
p15
aVthe more I'm really impressed by animal locomotion.
p16
aVIf you think of a dolphin swimming or a cat running or jumping around,
p17
aVor even us as humans,
p18
aVwhen you go jogging or play tennis,
p19
aVwe do amazing things.
p20
aVAnd in fact, our nervous system solves a very, very complex control problem.
p21
aVIt has to coordinate more or less 200 muscles perfectly,
p22
aVbecause if the coordination is bad, we fall over or we do bad locomotion.
p23
aVAnd my goal is to understand how this works.
p24
aa(lp25
VThere are four main components behind animal locomotion.
p26
aVThe first component is just the body,
p27
aVand in fact we should never underestimate
p28
aVto what extent the biomechanics already simplify locomotion in animals.
p29
aVThen you have the spinal cord,
p30
aVand in the spinal cord you find reflexes,
p31
aVmultiple reflexes that create a sensorimotor coordination loop
p32
aVbetween neural activity in the spinal cord and mechanical activity.
p33
aVA third component are central pattern generators.
p34
aVThese are very interesting circuits in the spinal cord of vertebrate animals
p35
aVthat can generate, by themselves,
p36
aVvery coordinated rhythmic patterns of activity
p37
aVwhile receiving only very simple input signals.
p38
aVAnd these input signals
p39
aVcoming from descending modulation from higher parts of the brain,
p40
aVlike the motor cortex, the cerebellum, the basal ganglia,
p41
aVwill all modulate activity of the spinal cord
p42
aVwhile we do locomotion.
p43
aVBut what's interesting is to what extent just a low-level component,
p44
aVthe spinal cord, together with the body,
p45
aValready solve a big part of the locomotion problem.
p46
aVYou probably know it by the fact that you can cut the head off a chicken,
p47
aVit can still run for a while,
p48
aVshowing that just the lower part, spinal cord and body,
p49
aValready solve a big part of locomotion.
p50
aa(lp51
VNow, understanding how this works is very complex,
p52
aVbecause first of all,
p53
aVrecording activity in the spinal cord is very difficult.
p54
aVIt's much easier to implant electrodes in the motor cortex
p55
aVthan in the spinal cord, because it's protected by the vertebrae.
p56
aVEspecially in humans, very hard to do.
p57
aVA second difficulty is that locomotion is really due to a very complex
p58
aVand very dynamic interaction between these four components.
p59
aVSo it's very hard to find out what's the role of each over time.
p60
aVThis is where biorobots like Pleurobot and mathematical models
p61
aVcan really help.
p62
aa(lp63
VSo what's biorobotics?
p64
aVBiorobotics is a very active field of research in robotics
p65
aVwhere people want to take inspiration from animals
p66
aVto make robots to go outdoors,
p67
aVlike service robots or search and rescue robots
p68
aVor field robots.
p69
aVAnd the big goal here is to take inspiration from animals
p70
aVto make robots that can handle complex terrain \u2014
p71
aVstairs, mountains, forests,
p72
aVplaces where robots still have difficulties
p73
aVand where animals can do a much better job.
p74
aVThe robot can be a wonderful scientific tool as well.
p75
aVThere are some very nice projects where robots are used,
p76
aVlike a scientific tool for neuroscience, for biomechanics or for hydrodynamics.
p77
aVAnd this is exactly the purpose of Pleurobot.
p78
aVSo what we do in my lab is to collaborate with neurobiologists
p79
aVlike Jean-Marie Cabelguen, a neurobiologist in Bordeaux in France,
p80
aVand we want to make spinal cord models and validate them on robots.
p81
aVAnd here we want to start simple.
p82
aa(lp83
VSo it's good to start with simple animals
p84
aVlike lampreys, which are very primitive fish,
p85
aVand then gradually go toward more complex locomotion,
p86
aVlike in salamanders,
p87
aVbut also in cats and in humans,
p88
aVin mammals.
p89
aVAnd here, a robot becomes an interesting tool
p90
aVto validate our models.
p91
aVAnd in fact, for me, Pleurobot is a kind of dream becoming true.
p92
aVLike, more or less 20 years ago I was already working on a computer
p93
aVmaking simulations of lamprey and salamander locomotion
p94
aVduring my PhD.
p95
aVBut I always knew that my simulations were just approximations.
p96
aVLike, simulating the physics in water or with mud or with complex ground,
p97
aVit's very hard to simulate that properly on a computer.
p98
aVWhy not have a real robot and real physics?
p99
aVSo among all these animals, one of my favorites is the salamander.
p100
aVYou might ask why, and it's because as an amphibian,
p101
aVit's a really key animal from an evolutionary point of view.
p102
aVIt makes a wonderful link between swimming,
p103
aVas you find it in eels or fish,
p104
aVand quadruped locomotion, as you see in mammals, in cats and humans.
p105
aVAnd in fact, the modern salamander
p106
aVis very close to the first terrestrial vertebrate,
p107
aVso it's almost a living fossil,
p108
aVwhich gives us access to our ancestor,
p109
aVthe ancestor to all terrestrial tetrapods.
p110
aa(lp111
VSo the salamander swims
p112
aVby doing what's called an anguilliform swimming gait,
p113
aVso they propagate a nice traveling wave of muscle activity from head to tail.
p114
aVAnd if you place the salamander on the ground,
p115
aVit switches to what's called a walking trot gait.
p116
aVIn this case, you have nice periodic activation of the limbs
p117
aVwhich are very nicely coordinated
p118
aVwith this standing wave undulation of the body,
p119
aVand that's exactly the gait that you are seeing here on Pleurobot.
p120
aVNow, one thing which is very surprising and fascinating in fact
p121
aVis the fact that all this can be generated just by the spinal cord and the body.
p122
aVSo if you take a decerebrated salamander \u2014
p123
aVit's not so nice but you remove the head \u2014
p124
aVand if you electrically stimulate the spinal cord,
p125
aVat low level of stimulation this will induce a walking-like gait.
p126
aVIf you stimulate a bit more, the gait accelerates.
p127
aVAnd at some point, there's a threshold,
p128
aVand automatically, the animal switches to swimming.
p129
aVThis is amazing.
p130
aVJust changing the global drive,
p131
aVas if you are pressing the gas pedal
p132
aVof descending modulation to your spinal cord,
p133
aVmakes a complete switch between two very different gaits.
p134
aVAnd in fact, the same has been observed in cats.
p135
aVIf you stimulate the spinal cord of a cat,
p136
aVyou can switch between walk, trot and gallop.
p137
aVOr in birds, you can make a bird switch between walking,
p138
aVat a low level of stimulation,
p139
aVand flapping its wings at high-level stimulation.
p140
aVAnd this really shows that the spinal cord
p141
aVis a very sophisticated locomotion controller.
p142
aa(lp143
VSo we studied salamander locomotion in more detail,
p144
aVand we had in fact access to a very nice X-ray video machine
p145
aVfrom Professor Martin Fischer in Jena University in Germany.
p146
aVAnd thanks to that, you really have an amazing machine
p147
aVto record all the bone motion in great detail.
p148
aVThat's what we did.
p149
aVSo we basically figured out which bones are important for us
p150
aVand collected their motion in 3D.
p151
aVAnd what we did is collect a whole database of motions,
p152
aVboth on ground and in water,
p153
aVto really collect a whole database of motor behaviors
p154
aVthat a real animal can do.
p155
aVAnd then our job as roboticists was to replicate that in our robot.
p156
aVSo we did a whole optimization process to find out the right structure,
p157
aVwhere to place the motors, how to connect them together,
p158
aVto be able to replay these motions as well as possible.
p159
aVAnd this is how Pleurobot came to life.
p160
aa(lp161
VSo let's look at how close it is to the real animal.
p162
aVSo what you see here is almost a direct comparison
p163
aVbetween the walking of the real animal and the Pleurobot.
p164
aVYou can see that we have almost a one-to-one exact replay
p165
aVof the walking gait.
p166
aVIf you go backwards and slowly, you see it even better.
p167
aVBut even better, we can do swimming.
p168
aVSo for that we have a dry suit that we put all over the robot \u2014
p169
aa(lp170
V(Laughter)
p171
aa(lp172
Vand then we can go in water and start replaying the swimming gaits.
p173
aVAnd here, we were very happy, because this is difficult to do.
p174
aVThe physics of interaction are complex.
p175
aVOur robot is much bigger than a small animal,
p176
aVso we had to do what's called dynamic scaling of the frequencies
p177
aVto make sure we had the same interaction physics.
p178
aVBut you see at the end, we have a very close match,
p179
aVand we were very, very happy with this.
p180
aVSo let's go to the spinal cord.
p181
aVSo here what we did with Jean-Marie Cabelguen
p182
aVis model the spinal cord circuits.
p183
aVAnd what's interesting is that the salamander
p184
aVhas kept a very primitive circuit,
p185
aVwhich is very similar to the one we find in the lamprey,
p186
aVthis primitive eel-like fish,
p187
aVand it looks like during evolution,
p188
aVnew neural oscillators have been added to control the limbs,
p189
aVto do the leg locomotion.
p190
aVAnd we know where these neural oscillators are
p191
aVbut what we did was to make a mathematical model
p192
aVto see how they should be coupled
p193
aVto allow this transition between the two very different gaits.
p194
aVAnd we tested that on board of a robot.
p195
aa(lp196
VAnd this is how it looks.
p197
aVSo what you see here is a previous version of Pleurobot
p198
aVthat's completely controlled by our spinal cord model
p199
aVprogrammed on board of the robot.
p200
aVAnd the only thing we do
p201
aVis send to the robot through a remote control
p202
aVthe two descending signals it normally should receive
p203
aVfrom the upper part of the brain.
p204
aVAnd what's interesting is, by playing with these signals,
p205
aVwe can completely control speed, heading and type of gait.
p206
aVFor instance,
p207
aVwhen we stimulate at a low level, we have the walking gait,
p208
aVand at some point, if we stimulate a lot,
p209
aVvery rapidly it switches to the swimming gait.
p210
aVAnd finally, we can also do turning very nicely
p211
aVby just stimulating more one side of the spinal cord than the other.
p212
aVAnd I think it's really beautiful
p213
aVhow nature has distributed control
p214
aVto really give a lot of responsibility to the spinal cord
p215
aVso that the upper part of the brain doesn't need to worry about every muscle.
p216
aVIt just has to worry about this high-level modulation,
p217
aVand it's really the job of the spinal cord to coordinate all the muscles.
p218
aa(lp219
VSo now let's go to cat locomotion and the importance of biomechanics.
p220
aVSo this is another project
p221
aVwhere we studied cat biomechanics,
p222
aVand we wanted to see how much the morphology helps locomotion.
p223
aVAnd we found three important criteria in the properties,
p224
aVbasically, of the limbs.
p225
aVThe first one is that a cat limb
p226
aVmore or less looks like a pantograph-like structure.
p227
aVSo a pantograph is a mechanical structure
p228
aVwhich keeps the upper segment and the lower segments always parallel.
p229
aVSo a simple geometrical system that kind of coordinates a bit
p230
aVthe internal movement of the segments.
p231
aVA second property of cat limbs is that they are very lightweight.
p232
aVMost of the muscles are in the trunk,
p233
aVwhich is a good idea, because then the limbs have low inertia
p234
aVand can be moved very rapidly.
p235
aVThe last final important property is this very elastic behavior of the cat limb,
p236
aVso to handle impacts and forces.
p237
aVAnd this is how we designed Cheetah-Cub.
p238
aa(lp239
VSo let's invite Cheetah-Cub onstage.
p240
aVSo this is Peter Eckert, who does his PhD on this robot,
p241
aVand as you see, it's a cute little robot.
p242
aVIt looks a bit like a toy,
p243
aVbut it was really used as a scientific tool
p244
aVto investigate these properties of the legs of the cat.
p245
aVSo you see, it's very compliant, very lightweight,
p246
aVand also very elastic,
p247
aVso you can easily press it down and it will not break.
p248
aVIt will just jump, in fact.
p249
aVAnd this very elastic property is also very important.
p250
aVAnd you also see a bit these properties
p251
aVof these three segments of the leg as pantograph.
p252
aa(lp253
VNow, what's interesting is that this quite dynamic gait
p254
aVis obtained purely in open loop,
p255
aVmeaning no sensors, no complex feedback loops.
p256
aVAnd that's interesting, because it means
p257
aVthat just the mechanics already stabilized this quite rapid gait,
p258
aVand that really good mechanics already basically simplify locomotion.
p259
aVTo the extent that we can even disturb a bit locomotion,
p260
aVas you will see in the next video,
p261
aVwhere we can for instance do some exercise where we have the robot go down a step,
p262
aVand the robot will not fall over,
p263
aVwhich was a surprise for us.
p264
aVThis is a small perturbation.
p265
aVI was expecting the robot to immediately fall over,
p266
aVbecause there are no sensors, no fast feedback loop.
p267
aVBut no, just the mechanics stabilized the gait,
p268
aVand the robot doesn't fall over.
p269
aVObviously, if you make the step bigger, and if you have obstacles,
p270
aVyou need the full control loops and reflexes and everything.
p271
aVBut what's important here is that just for small perturbation,
p272
aVthe mechanics are right.
p273
aVAnd I think this is a very important message
p274
aVfrom biomechanics and robotics to neuroscience,
p275
aVsaying don't underestimate to what extent the body already helps locomotion.
p276
aa(lp277
VNow, how does this relate to human locomotion?
p278
aVClearly, human locomotion is more complex than cat and salamander locomotion,
p279
aVbut at the same time, the nervous system of humans is very similar
p280
aVto that of other vertebrates.
p281
aVAnd especially the spinal cord
p282
aVis also the key controller for locomotion in humans.
p283
aVThat's why, if there's a lesion of the spinal cord,
p284
aVthis has dramatic effects.
p285
aVThe person can become paraplegic or tetraplegic.
p286
aVThis is because the brain loses this communication
p287
aVwith the spinal cord.
p288
aVEspecially, it loses this descending modulation
p289
aVto initiate and modulate locomotion.
p290
aVSo a big goal of neuroprosthetics
p291
aVis to be able to reactivate that communication
p292
aVusing electrical or chemical stimulations.
p293
aVAnd there are several teams in the world that do exactly that,
p294
aVespecially at EPFL.
p295
aVMy colleagues Grégoire Courtine and Silvestro Micera,
p296
aVwith whom I collaborate.
p297
aa(lp298
VBut to do this properly, it's very important to understand
p299
aVhow the spinal cord works,
p300
aVhow it interacts with the body,
p301
aVand how the brain communicates with the spinal cord.
p302
aVThis is where the robots and models that I've presented today
p303
aVwill hopefully play a key role
p304
aVtowards these very important goals.
p305
aa(lp306
VThank you.
p307
aa(lp308
V(Applause)
p309
aa(lp310
VBruno Giussani: Auke, I've seen in your lab other robots
p311
aVthat do things like swim in pollution
p312
aVand measure the pollution while they swim.
p313
aVBut for this one,
p314
aVyou mentioned in your talk, like a side project,
p315
aVsearch and rescue,
p316
aVand it does have a camera on its nose.
p317
aa(lp318
VAuke Ijspeert: Absolutely. So the robot \u2014
p319
aVWe have some spin-off projects
p320
aVwhere we would like to use the robots to do search and rescue inspection,
p321
aVso this robot is now seeing you.
p322
aVAnd the big dream is to, if you have a difficult situation
p323
aVlike a collapsed building or a building that is flooded,
p324
aVand this is very dangerous for a rescue team or even rescue dogs,
p325
aVwhy not send in a robot that can crawl around, swim, walk,
p326
aVwith a camera onboard to do inspection and identify survivors
p327
aVand possibly create a communication link with the survivor.
p328
aa(lp329
VBG: Of course, assuming the survivors don't get scared by the shape of this.
p330
aa(lp331
VAI: Yeah, we should probably change the appearance quite a bit,
p332
aVbecause here I guess a survivor might die of a heart attack
p333
aVjust of being worried that this would feed on you.
p334
aVBut by changing the appearance and it making it more robust,
p335
aVI'm sure we can make a good tool out of it.
p336
aa(lp337
VBG: Thank you very much. Thank you and your team.
