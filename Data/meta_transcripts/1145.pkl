VI decided when I was asked to do this
p4
aVthat what I really wanted to talk about was my friend, Richard Feynman.
p5
aVI was one of the fortunate few that really did get to know him
p6
aVand enjoyed his presence.
p7
aVAnd I'm going to tell you about the Richard Feynman that I knew.
p8
aVI'm sure there are people here who could tell you
p9
aVabout the Richard Feynman they knew,
p10
aVand it would probably be a different Richard Feynman.
p11
aa(lp12
VRichard Feynman was a very complex man.
p13
aVHe was a man of many, many parts.
p14
aVHe was, of course, foremost, a very, very, very great scientist.
p15
aVHe was an actor. You saw him act.
p16
aVI also had the good fortune to be in those lectures,
p17
aVup in the balcony.
p18
aVThey were fantastic.
p19
aVHe was a philosopher.
p20
aVHe was a drum player.
p21
aVHe was a teacher par excellence.
p22
aVRichard Feynman was also a showman,
p23
aVan enormous showman.
p24
aVHe was brash, irreverent.
p25
aVHe was full of macho, a kind of macho one-upmanship.
p26
aVHe loved intellectual battle.
p27
aVHe had a gargantuan ego.
p28
aVBut the man had, somehow,
p29
aVa lot of room at the bottom.
p30
aVAnd what I mean by that is a lot of room, in my case \u2014
p31
aVI can't speak for anybody else, but in my case \u2014
p32
aVa lot of room for another big ego.
p33
aVWell, not as big as his,
p34
aVbut fairly big.
p35
aVI always felt good with Dick Feynman.
p36
aa(lp37
VIt was always fun to be with him.
p38
aVHe always made me feel smart.
p39
aVHow can somebody like that make you feel smart?
p40
aVSomehow he did.
p41
aVHe made me feel smart. He made me feel he was smart.
p42
aVHe made me feel we were both smart,
p43
aVand the two of us could solve any problem whatever.
p44
aVAnd in fact, we did sometimes do physics together.
p45
aVWe never published a paper together,
p46
aVbut we did have a lot of fun.
p47
aa(lp48
VHe loved to win,
p49
aVwin these little macho games we would sometimes play.
p50
aVAnd he didn't only play them with me, but with all sorts of people.
p51
aVHe would almost always win.
p52
aVBut when he didn't win, when he lost,
p53
aVhe would laugh and seem to have just as much fun
p54
aVas if he had won.
p55
aa(lp56
VI remember once he told me a story
p57
aVabout a joke the students played on him.
p58
aVI think it was for his birthday \u2014
p59
aVthey took him for lunch
p60
aVto a sandwich place in Pasadena.
p61
aVIt may still exist; I don't know.
p62
aVCelebrity sandwiches was their thing.
p63
aVYou could get a Marilyn Monroe sandwich.
p64
aVYou could get a Humphrey Bogart sandwich.
p65
aVThe students went there in advance,
p66
aVand arranged that they'd all order Feynman sandwiches.
p67
aVOne after another, they came in and ordered Feynman sandwiches.
p68
aVFeynman loved this story.
p69
aVHe told me this story, and he was really happy and laughing.
p70
aVWhen he finished the story, I said to him,
p71
aV"Dick, I wonder what would be the difference
p72
aVbetween a Feynman sandwich and a Susskind sandwich."
p73
aVAnd without skipping a beat at all,
p74
aVhe said, "Well, they'd be about the same.
p75
aVThe only difference is a Susskind sandwich would have a lot more ham."
p76
aV"Ham" as in bad actor.
p77
aa(lp78
V(Laughter)
p79
aa(lp80
VWell, I happened to have been very quick that day,
p81
aVand I said, "Yeah, but a lot less baloney."
p82
aa(lp83
V(Laughter)
p84
aa(lp85
V(Applause)
p86
aa(lp87
VThe truth of the matter
p88
aVis that a Feynman sandwich had a load of ham,
p89
aVbut absolutely no baloney.
p90
aVWhat Feynman hated worse than anything else
p91
aVwas intellectual pretense \u2014
p92
aVphoniness,
p93
aVfalse sophistication, jargon.
p94
aVI remember sometime during the mid-'80s,
p95
aVDick and I and Sidney Coleman would meet a couple of times
p96
aVup in San Francisco \u2014 at some very rich guy's house \u2014
p97
aVup in San Francisco for dinner.
p98
aVAnd the last time the rich guy invited us,
p99
aVhe also invited a couple of philosophers.
p100
aVThese guys were philosophers of mind.
p101
aVTheir specialty was the philosophy of consciousness.
p102
aVAnd they were full of all kinds of jargon.
p103
aVI'm trying to remember the words \u2014
p104
aV"monism," "dualism," categories all over the place.
p105
aVI didn't know what those meant, neither did Dick or Sydney, for that matter.
p106
aa(lp107
VAnd what did we talk about?
p108
aVWell, what do you talk about when you talk about minds?
p109
aVThere's one obvious thing to talk about:
p110
aVCan a machine become a mind?
p111
aVCan you build a machine
p112
aVthat thinks like a human being that is conscious?
p113
aVWe sat around and talked about this \u2014 we of course never resolved it.
p114
aVBut the trouble with the philosophers
p115
aVis that they were philosophizing
p116
aVwhen they should have been science-ophizing.
p117
aVIt's a scientific question, after all.
p118
aVAnd this was a very, very dangerous thing to do
p119
aVaround Dick Feynman.
p120
aa(lp121
V(Laughter)
p122
aa(lp123
VFeynman let them have it \u2014 both barrels, right between the eyes.
p124
aVIt was brutal; it was funny \u2014 ooh, it was funny.
p125
aVBut it was really brutal.
p126
aVHe really popped their balloon.
p127
aVBut the amazing thing was \u2014 Feynman had to leave a little early;
p128
aVhe wasn't feeling too well, so he left a little bit early.
p129
aVAnd Sidney and I were left there with the two philosophers.
p130
aVAnd the amazing thing is these guys were flying.
p131
aVThey were so happy.
p132
aVThey had met the great man;
p133
aVthey had been instructed by the great man;
p134
aVthey had an enormous amount of fun
p135
aVhaving their faces shoved in the mud ...
p136
aVAnd it was something special.
p137
aVI realized there was something just extraordinary about Feynman,
p138
aVeven when he did what he did.
p139
aa(lp140
VDick \u2014 he was my friend; I did call him Dick \u2014
p141
aVDick and I had a little bit of a rapport.
p142
aVI think it may have been a special rapport that he and I had.
p143
aVWe liked each other; we liked the same kind of things.
p144
aVI also like the intellectual macho games.
p145
aVSometimes I would win, mostly he would win,
p146
aVbut we both enjoyed them.
p147
aVAnd Dick became convinced at some point
p148
aVthat he and I had some kind of similarity of personality.
p149
aVI don't think he was right.
p150
aVI think the only point of similarity between us
p151
aVis we both like to talk about ourselves.
p152
aVBut he was convinced of this.
p153
aVAnd the man was incredibly curious.
p154
aVAnd he wanted to understand what it was and why it was
p155
aVthat there was this funny connection.
p156
aa(lp157
VAnd one day, we were walking.
p158
aVWe were in France, in Les Houches.
p159
aVWe were up in the mountains, 1976.
p160
aVAnd Feynman said to me, "Leonardo ..."
p161
aVThe reason he called me "Leonardo" is because we were in Europe,
p162
aVand he was practicing his French.
p163
aa(lp164
V(Laughter)
p165
aa(lp166
VAnd he said, "Leonardo,
p167
aVwere you closer to your mother or your father when you were a kid?"
p168
aVI said, "Well, my real hero was my father.
p169
aVHe was a working man,
p170
aVhad a fifth-grade education.
p171
aVHe was a master mechanic, and he taught me how to use tools.
p172
aVHe taught me all sorts of things about mechanical things.
p173
aVHe even taught me the Pythagorean theorem.
p174
aVHe didn't call it the hypotenuse,
p175
aVhe called it the shortcut distance."
p176
aa(lp177
VAnd Feynman's eyes just opened up.
p178
aVHe went off like a lightbulb.
p179
aVAnd he said that he had had
p180
aVbasically exactly the same relationship with his father.
p181
aVIn fact, he had been convinced at one time
p182
aVthat to be a good physicist,
p183
aVit was very important to have had that kind of relationship
p184
aVwith your father.
p185
aVI apologize for the sexist conversation here,
p186
aVbut this is the way it really happened.
p187
aa(lp188
VHe said he had been absolutely convinced that this was necessary,
p189
aVa necessary part of the growing up of a young physicist.
p190
aVBeing Dick, he, of course, wanted to check this.
p191
aVHe wanted to go out and do an experiment.
p192
aa(lp193
V(Laughter)
p194
aa(lp195
VWell, he did.
p196
aVHe went out and did an experiment.
p197
aVHe asked all his friends that he thought were good physicists,
p198
aV"Was it your mom or your pop that influenced you?"
p199
aVThey were all men,
p200
aVand to a man, every single one of them said,
p201
aV"My mother."
p202
aa(lp203
V(Laughter)
p204
aa(lp205
VThere went that theory, down the trash can of history.
p206
aa(lp207
V(Laughter)
p208
aa(lp209
VBut he was very excited that he had finally met somebody
p210
aVwho had the same experience with his father
p211
aVas he had with his father.
p212
aVAnd for some time, he was convinced this was the reason we got along so well.
p213
aVI don't know. Maybe. Who knows?
p214
aa(lp215
VBut let me tell you a little bit about Feynman the physicist.
p216
aVFeynman's style \u2014 no, "style" is not the right word.
p217
aV"Style" makes you think of the bow tie he might have worn,
p218
aVor the suit he was wearing.
p219
aVIt's something much deeper than that,
p220
aVbut I can't think of another word for it.
p221
aVFeynman's scientific style was always to look for the simplest,
p222
aVmost elementary solution to a problem that was possible.
p223
aVIf it wasn't possible, you had to use something fancier.
p224
aVNo doubt, part of this was his great joy and pleasure
p225
aVin showing people that he could think more simply than they could.
p226
aVBut he also deeply believed, he truly believed,
p227
aVthat if you couldn't explain something simply,
p228
aVyou didn't understand it.
p229
aVIn the 1950s, people were trying to figure out
p230
aVhow superfluid helium worked.
p231
aa(lp232
VThere was a theory.
p233
aVIt was due to a Russian mathematical physicist.
p234
aVIt was a complicated theory;
p235
aVI'll tell you what it was soon enough.
p236
aVIt was a terribly complicated theory,
p237
aVfull of very difficult integrals and formulas
p238
aVand mathematics and so forth.
p239
aVAnd it sort of worked, but it didn't work very well.
p240
aVThe only way it worked
p241
aVis when the helium atoms were very, very far apart.
p242
aVAnd unfortunately,
p243
aVthe helium atoms in liquid helium are right on top of each other.
p244
aa(lp245
VFeynman decided, as a sort of amateur helium physicist,
p246
aVthat he would try to figure it out.
p247
aVHe had an idea, a very clear idea.
p248
aVHe would try to figure out
p249
aVwhat the quantum wave function of this huge number of atoms looked like.
p250
aVHe would try to visualize it,
p251
aVguided by a small number of simple principles.
p252
aVThe small number of simple principles were very, very simple.
p253
aVThe first one was that when helium atoms touch each other,
p254
aVthey repel.
p255
aVThe implication of that is that the wave function has to go to zero,
p256
aVit has to vanish when the helium atoms touch each other.
p257
aVThe other fact is that in the ground state \u2014
p258
aVthe lowest energy state of a quantum system \u2014
p259
aVthe wave function is always very smooth;
p260
aVit has the minimum number of wiggles.
p261
aa(lp262
VSo he sat down \u2014
p263
aVand I imagine he had nothing more
p264
aVthan a simple piece of paper and a pencil \u2014
p265
aVand he tried to write down, and did write down,
p266
aVthe simplest function that he could think of,
p267
aVwhich had the boundary conditions
p268
aVthat the wave function vanish when things touch
p269
aVand is smooth in between.
p270
aVHe wrote down a simple thing \u2014 so simple, in fact,
p271
aVthat I suspect a really smart high-school student
p272
aVwho didn't even have calculus
p273
aVcould understand what he wrote down.
p274
aVThe thing was, that simple thing that he wrote down
p275
aVexplained everything that was known at the time about liquid helium,
p276
aVand then some.
p277
aa(lp278
VI've always wondered whether the professionals \u2014
p279
aVthe real professional helium physicists \u2014
p280
aVwere just a little bit embarrassed by this.
p281
aVThey had their super-powerful technique,
p282
aVand they couldn't do as well.
p283
aVIncidentally, I'll tell you what that super-powerful technique was.
p284
aVIt was the technique of Feynman diagrams.
p285
aa(lp286
V(Laughter)
p287
aa(lp288
VHe did it again in 1968.
p289
aVIn 1968, in my own university \u2014 I wasn't there at the time \u2014
p290
aVthey were exploring the structure of the proton.
p291
aVThe proton is obviously made of a whole bunch of little particles;
p292
aVthis was more or less known.
p293
aVAnd the way to analyze it was, of course, Feynman diagrams.
p294
aVThat's what Feynman diagrams were constructed for \u2014
p295
aVto understand particles.
p296
aVThe experiments that were going on were very simple:
p297
aVyou simply take the proton,
p298
aVand you hit it really sharply with an electron.
p299
aVThis was the thing the Feynman diagrams were for.
p300
aa(lp301
VThe only problem was that Feynman diagrams are complicated.
p302
aVThey're difficult integrals.
p303
aVIf you could do all of them, you would have a very precise theory,
p304
aVbut you couldn't \u2014 they were just too complicated.
p305
aVPeople were trying to do them.
p306
aVYou could do a one-loop diagram. Don't worry about one loop.
p307
aVOne loop, two loops \u2014 maybe you could do a three-loop diagram,
p308
aVbut beyond that, you couldn't do anything.
p309
aa(lp310
VFeynman said, "Forget all of that.
p311
aVJust think of the proton
p312
aVas an assemblage, a swarm, of little particles."
p313
aVHe called them "partons."
p314
aVHe said, "Just think of it as a swarm of partons moving real fast."
p315
aVBecause they're moving real fast,
p316
aVrelativity says the internal motions go very slow.
p317
aVThe electron hits it suddenly \u2014
p318
aVit's like taking a very sudden snapshot of the proton.
p319
aVWhat do you see?
p320
aVYou see a frozen bunch of partons.
p321
aVThey don't move,
p322
aVand because they don't move during the course of the experiment,
p323
aVyou don't have to worry about how they're moving.
p324
aVYou don't have to worry about the forces between them.
p325
aVYou just get to think of it as a population of frozen partons."
p326
aVThis was the key to analyzing these experiments.
p327
aVExtremely effective.
p328
aVSomebody said the word "revolution" is a bad word.
p329
aVI suppose it is, so I won't say "revolution,"
p330
aVbut it certainly evolved very, very deeply our understanding of the proton,
p331
aVand of particles beyond that.
p332
aa(lp333
VWell, I had some more that I was going to tell you
p334
aVabout my connection with Feynman,
p335
aVwhat he was like,
p336
aVbut I see I have exactly half a minute.
p337
aVSo I think I'll just finish up by saying:
p338
aVI actually don't think Feynman would have liked this event.
p339
aVI think he would have said, "I don't need this."
p340
aVBut ...
p341
aa(lp342
V(Laughter)
p343
aa(lp344
VHow should we honor Feynman?
p345
aVHow should we really honor Feynman?
p346
aVI think the answer is we should honor Feynman
p347
aVby getting as much baloney out of our own sandwiches
p348
aVas we can.
p349
aa(lp350
VThank you.
