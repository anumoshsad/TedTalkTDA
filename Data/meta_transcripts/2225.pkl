VWhen I was a kid,
p4
aVthe disaster we worried about most  was a nuclear war.
p5
aVThat's why we had a barrel like this down in our basement,
p6
aVfilled with cans of food and water.
p7
aVWhen the nuclear attack came,
p8
aVwe were supposed to go downstairs, hunker down, and eat out of that barrel.
p9
aa(lp10
VToday the greatest risk  of global catastrophe
p11
aVdoesn't look like this.
p12
aVInstead, it looks like this.
p13
aVIf anything kills over 10 million people in the next few decades,
p14
aVit's most likely to be  a highly infectious virus
p15
aVrather than a war.
p16
aVNot missiles, but microbes.
p17
aVNow, part of the reason for this is that
p18
aVwe've invested a huge amount in nuclear deterrents.
p19
aVBut we've actually invested very little  in a system to stop an epidemic.
p20
aVWe're not ready for the next epidemic.
p21
aa(lp22
VLet's look at Ebola.
p23
aVI'm sure all of you read about it  in the newspaper,
p24
aVlots of tough challenges.
p25
aVI followed it carefully  through the case analysis tools
p26
aVwe use to track polio eradication.
p27
aVAnd as you look at what went on,
p28
aVthe problem wasn't that there was a system that didn't work well enough,
p29
aVthe problem was that we  didn't have a system at all.
p30
aVIn fact, there's some pretty obvious key missing pieces.
p31
aa(lp32
VWe didn't have a group of epidemiologists  ready to go, who would have gone,
p33
aVseen what the disease was, seen how far it had spread.
p34
aVThe case reports came in on paper.
p35
aVIt was very delayed before they were put online
p36
aVand they were extremely inaccurate.
p37
aVWe didn't have a medical team ready to go.
p38
aVWe didn't have a way of preparing people.
p39
aVNow, Médecins Sans Frontières  did a great job orchestrating volunteers.
p40
aVBut even so, we were far slower than we should have been
p41
aVgetting the thousands of workers into these countries.
p42
aVAnd a large epidemic would require us to have hundreds of thousands of workers.
p43
aVThere was no one there  to look at treatment approaches.
p44
aVNo one to look at the diagnostics.
p45
aVNo one to figure out  what tools should be used.
p46
aVAs an example, we could have  taken the blood of survivors,
p47
aVprocessed it, and put that plasma back in people to protect them.
p48
aVBut that was never tried.
p49
aa(lp50
VSo there was a lot that was missing.
p51
aVAnd these things  are really a global failure.
p52
aVThe WHO is funded to monitor epidemics, but not to do these things I talked about.
p53
aVNow, in the movies it's quite different.
p54
aVThere's a group of handsome epidemiologists ready to go,
p55
aVthey move in, they save the day, but that's just pure Hollywood.
p56
aa(lp57
VThe failure to prepare  could allow the next epidemic
p58
aVto be dramatically  more devastating than Ebola
p59
aVLet's look at the progression  of Ebola over this year.
p60
aVAbout 10,000 people died,
p61
aVand nearly all were in the three West African countries.
p62
aVThere's three reasons why it didn't spread more.
p63
aVThe first is that there was a lot  of heroic work by the health workers.
p64
aVThey found the people and they  prevented more infections.
p65
aVThe second is the nature of the virus.
p66
aVEbola does not spread through the air.
p67
aVAnd by the time you're contagious,
p68
aVmost people are so sick  that they're bedridden.
p69
aVThird, it didn't get into many urban areas.
p70
aVAnd that was just luck.
p71
aVIf it had gotten into a lot  more urban areas,
p72
aVthe case numbers  would have been much larger.
p73
aa(lp74
VSo next time, we might not be so lucky.
p75
aVYou can have a virus where people  feel well enough while they're infectious
p76
aVthat they get on a plane or they go to a market.
p77
aVThe source of the virus could be  a natural epidemic like Ebola,
p78
aVor it could be bioterrorism.
p79
aVSo there are things that would literally make things a thousand times worse.
p80
aa(lp81
VIn fact, let's look at a model of a virus spread through the air,
p82
aVlike the Spanish Flu back in 1918.
p83
aVSo here's what would happen:
p84
aVIt would spread throughout the world very, very quickly.
p85
aVAnd you can see over 30 million people died from that epidemic.
p86
aVSo this is a serious problem.
p87
aVWe should be concerned.
p88
aa(lp89
VBut in fact, we can build a really good response system.
p90
aVWe have the benefits of all the science and technology that we talk about here.
p91
aVWe've got cell phones
p92
aVto get information from the public  and get information out to them.
p93
aVWe have satellite maps where we can see where people are and where they're moving.
p94
aVWe have advances in biology
p95
aVthat should dramatically change  the turnaround time to look at a pathogen
p96
aVand be able to make drugs and vaccines that fit for that pathogen.
p97
aVSo we can have tools,
p98
aVbut those tools need to be put into an overall global health system.
p99
aVAnd we need preparedness.
p100
aa(lp101
VThe best lessons, I think,  on how to get prepared
p102
aVare again, what we do for war.
p103
aVFor soldiers, we have full-time, waiting to go.
p104
aVWe have reserves that can scale  us up to large numbers.
p105
aVNATO has a mobile unit  that can deploy very rapidly.
p106
aVNATO does a lot of war games  to check, are people well trained?
p107
aVDo they understand  about fuel and logistics
p108
aVand the same radio frequencies?
p109
aVSo they are absolutely ready to go.
p110
aVSo those are the kinds of things we need to deal with an epidemic.
p111
aa(lp112
VWhat are the key pieces?
p113
aVFirst, we need strong health systems in poor countries.
p114
aVThat's where mothers  can give birth safely,
p115
aVkids can get all their vaccines.
p116
aVBut, also where we'll see  the outbreak very early on.
p117
aVWe need a medical reserve corps:
p118
aVlots of people who've got  the training and background
p119
aVwho are ready to go, with the expertise.
p120
aVAnd then we need to pair those medical people with the military.
p121
aVtaking advantage of the military's ability to move fast, do logistics
p122
aVand secure areas.
p123
aVWe need to do simulations,
p124
aVgerm games, not war games, so that we see where the holes are.
p125
aVThe last time a germ game  was done in the United States
p126
aVwas back in 2001,  and it didn't go so well.
p127
aVSo far the score is germs: 1, people: 0.
p128
aVFinally, we need lots of advanced R&D in areas of vaccines and diagnostics.
p129
aVThere are some big breakthroughs,  like the Adeno-associated virus,
p130
aVthat could work very, very quickly.
p131
aa(lp132
VNow I don't have an exact budget for what this would cost,
p133
aVbut I'm quite sure it's very modest compared to the potential harm.
p134
aVThe World Bank estimates that  if we have a worldwide flu epidemic,
p135
aVglobal wealth will go down by over three trillion dollars
p136
aVand we'd have millions and millions of deaths.
p137
aVThese investments  offer significant benefits
p138
aVbeyond just being ready for the epidemic.
p139
aVThe primary healthcare, the R&D,
p140
aVthose things would reduce  global health equity
p141
aVand make the world more just  as well as more safe.
p142
aa(lp143
VSo I think this should absolutely be a priority.
p144
aVThere's no need to panic.
p145
aVWe don't have to hoard cans of spaghetti or go down into the basement.
p146
aVBut we need to get going, because time is not on our side.
p147
aa(lp148
VIn fact, if there's one positive thing that can come out of the Ebola epidemic,
p149
aVit's that it can serve as an early  warning, a wake-up call, to get ready.
p150
aVIf we start now, we can be ready  for the next epidemic.
p151
