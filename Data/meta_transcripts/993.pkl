VSustainability represents
p4
aVthe what, the where and the how
p5
aVof what is caught.
p6
aVThe who and the why are what's important to me.
p7
aVI want to know the people behind my dinner choices.
p8
aVI want to know how I impact them.
p9
aVI want to know how they impact me.
p10
aVI want to know why they fish.
p11
aVI want to know how they rely on the water's bounty
p12
aVfor their living.
p13
aVUnderstanding all of this enables us
p14
aVto shift our perception of seafood
p15
aVaway from a commodity
p16
aVto an opportunity
p17
aVto restore our ecosystem.
p18
aVIt allows for us to celebrate the seafood
p19
aVthat we're also so fortunate to eat.
p20
aa(lp21
VSo what do we call this?
p22
aVI think we call it restorative seafood.
p23
aVWhere sustainability is the capacity
p24
aVto endure and maintain,
p25
aVrestorative is the ability to replenish and progress.
p26
aVRestorative seafood allows for an evolving and dynamic system
p27
aVand acknowledges our relationship with the ocean
p28
aVas a resource,
p29
aVsuggesting that we engage to replenish the ocean
p30
aVand to encourage its resiliency.
p31
aVIt is a more hopeful, it is a more human,
p32
aVand is a more useful way of understanding our environment.
p33
aa(lp34
VWallet guides \u2014 standard issue
p35
aVby lots in the marine conservation world \u2014
p36
aVare very handy; they're a wonderful tool.
p37
aVGreen, yellow and red lists [of] seafood species.
p38
aVThe association is very easy: buy green, don't buy red,
p39
aVthink twice about yellow.
p40
aVBut in my mind, it's really not enough
p41
aVto just eat green list.
p42
aVWe can't sustain this without the measure of our success
p43
aVreally changing the fate of the species
p44
aVin the yellow and the red.
p45
aVBut what if we eat only in the green list?
p46
aVYou've got pole-caught yellowfin tuna here \u2014
p47
aVcomes from sustainable stocks.
p48
aVPole caught \u2014 no bycatch.
p49
aVGreat for fishermen. Lots of money. Supporting local economies.
p50
aVBut it's a lion of the sea. It's a top predator.
p51
aa(lp52
VWhat's the context of this meal?
p53
aVAm I sitting down in a steakhouse to a 16-ounce portion of this?
p54
aVDo I do this three times a week?
p55
aVI might still be in the green list,
p56
aVbut I'm not doing myself, or you,
p57
aVor the oceans any favors.
p58
aVThe point is that we have to have a context,
p59
aVa gauge for our actions in all this.
p60
aVExample: I've heard that red wine is great for my health \u2014
p61
aVantioxidants and minerals \u2014 heart healthy.
p62
aVThat's great! I love red wine!
p63
aVI'm going to drink so much of it. I'm going to be so healthy.
p64
aVWell, how many bottles is it
p65
aVbefore you tell me that I have a problem?
p66
aVWell folks, we have a protein problem.
p67
aVWe have lost this sensibility
p68
aVwhen it regards our food,
p69
aVand we are paying a cost.
p70
aVThe problem is we are hiding that cost beneath the waves.
p71
aVWe are hiding that cost
p72
aVbehind the social acceptance of expanding waistlines.
p73
aVAnd we are hiding that cost behind monster profits.
p74
aa(lp75
VSo the first thing about this idea of restorative seafood
p76
aVis that it really takes into account our needs.
p77
aVRestorative seafood might best be represented
p78
aVnot by Jaws, or by Flipper, or the Gordon's fisherman,
p79
aVbut rather, by the Jolly Green Giant.
p80
aVVegetables:
p81
aVthey might yet save the oceans.
p82
aVSylvia likes to say that blue is the new green.
p83
aVWell I'd like to respectfully submit
p84
aVthat broccoli green might then be the new blue.
p85
aVWe must continue to eat
p86
aVthe best seafood possible, if at all.
p87
aVBut we also must eat it with a ton of vegetables.
p88
aVThe best part about restorative seafood though
p89
aVis that it comes on the half-shell
p90
aVwith a bottle of Tabasco and lemon wedges.
p91
aVIt comes in a five-ounce portion of tilapia
p92
aVbreaded with Dijon mustard and crispy, broiled breadcrumbs
p93
aVand a steaming pile of pecan quinoa pilaf
p94
aVwith crunchy, grilled broccoli
p95
aVso soft and sweet and charred and smoky on the outside
p96
aVwith just a hint of chili flake.
p97
aVWhooo!
p98
aVThis is an easy sell.
p99
aVAnd the best part is all of those ingredients are available
p100
aVto every family at the neighborhood Walmart.
p101
aa(lp102
VJamie Oliver is campaigning
p103
aVto save America from the way we eat.
p104
aVSylvia is campaigning to save the oceans
p105
aVfrom the way we eat.
p106
aVThere's a pattern here.
p107
aVForget nuclear holocaust;
p108
aVit's the fork that we have to worry about.
p109
aVWe have ravaged our Earth
p110
aVand then used the food that we've sourced
p111
aVto handicap ourselves in more ways than one.
p112
aVSo I think we have this whole eating thing wrong.
p113
aVAnd so I think it's time
p114
aVwe change what we expect from our food.
p115
aVSustainability is complicated
p116
aVbut dinner is a reality that we all very much understand.
p117
aVSo let's start there.
p118
aa(lp119
VThere's been a lot of movement recently in greening our food systems.
p120
aVDan Barber and Alice Waters
p121
aVare leading passionately the green food Delicious Revolution.
p122
aVBut green foods often represent
p123
aVa way for us to disregard
p124
aVthe responsibility as eaters.
p125
aVJust because it comes from a green source
p126
aVdoesn't mean we can treat it with disregard on the plate.
p127
aVWe have eco-friendly shrimp.
p128
aVWe can make them; we have that technology.
p129
aVBut we can never have any eco-friendly all-you-can-eat shrimp buffet.
p130
aVIt doesn't work.
p131
aVHeart-healthy dinner is a very important part
p132
aVof restorative seafood.
p133
aVWhile we try to manage declining marine populations,
p134
aVthe media's recommending increased consumption of seafood.
p135
aVStudies say that tens of thousands
p136
aVof American grandmothers, grandfathers, mothers and fathers
p137
aVmight be around for another birthday
p138
aVif we included more seafood.
p139
aVThat's a reward I am not willing to pass up.
p140
aVBut it's not all about the seafood.
p141
aVIt's about the way that we look at our plates.
p142
aa(lp143
VAs a chef, I realize the easiest thing for me to do
p144
aVis reduce the portion sizes on my plate.
p145
aVA couple things happened.
p146
aVI made more money.
p147
aVPeople started buying appetizers and salads,
p148
aVbecause they knew they weren't going to fill up on the entrees alone.
p149
aVPeople spent more time engaging in their meals,
p150
aVengaging with each other over their meals.
p151
aVPeople got, in short, more of what they came there for
p152
aVeven though they got less protein.
p153
aVThey got more calories over the course of a diversified meal.
p154
aVThey got healthier. I made more money.
p155
aVThis is great.
p156
aVEnvironmental consideration was served with every plate,
p157
aVbut it was served with a heaping mound
p158
aVof consideration for human interests at the same time.
p159
aa(lp160
VOne of the other things we did
p161
aVwas begin to diversify the species that we served \u2014
p162
aVsmall silverfish, anchovies, mackerel, sardines were uncommon.
p163
aVShellfish, mussels, oysters,
p164
aVclams, tilapia, char \u2014 these were the common species.
p165
aVWe were directing tastes
p166
aVtowards more resilience, more restorative options.
p167
aVThis is what we need to favor.
p168
aVThis is what the green list says.
p169
aVBut this is also how we can actually begin to restore our environment.
p170
aa(lp171
VBut what of those big predators,
p172
aVthose fashionable species,
p173
aVthat green list tuna that I was talking about earlier?
p174
aVWell, if you must, I have a recipe for you.
p175
aVIt pretty much works with any big fish in the ocean,
p176
aVso here we go.
p177
aVStart with a 16-ounce portion of big fish.
p178
aVGet a knife. Cut it into four portions.
p179
aVPut it on four plates.
p180
aVMound up those four plates with vegetables
p181
aVand then open up the very best bottle of Burgundy you have,
p182
aVlight the candles and celebrate it.
p183
aVCelebrate the opportunity you have to eat this.
p184
aVInvite your friends and neighbors over
p185
aVand repeat once a year,
p186
aVmaybe.
p187
aa(lp188
VI expect a lot from food.
p189
aVI expect health
p190
aVand joy and family and community.
p191
aVI expect that producing ingredients,
p192
aVpreparing dishes and eating meals
p193
aVis all part of the communion of human interests.
p194
aVI was lucky enough that my father was a fantastic cook.
p195
aVAnd he taught me very early on
p196
aVabout the privilege that eating represents.
p197
aVI remember well the meals of my childhood.
p198
aVThey were reasonable portions of protein
p199
aVserved with copious quantities of vegetables
p200
aVand small amounts of starch, usually rice.
p201
aVThis is still how I largely eat today.
p202
aVI get sick when I go to steakhouses.
p203
aVI get the meat sweats.
p204
aVIt's like a hangover from protein.
p205
aVIt's disgusting.
p206
aVBut of all the dire news that you'll hear
p207
aVand that you have heard about the state of our oceans,
p208
aVI have the unfortunate burden of delivering to you
p209
aVpossibly the very worst of it
p210
aVand that is this whole time
p211
aVyour mother was right.
p212
aVEat your vegetables.
p213
aVIt's pretty straightforward.
p214
aa(lp215
VSo what are we looking for in a meal?
p216
aVWell for health, I'm looking for wholesome ingredients
p217
aVthat are good for my body.
p218
aVFor joy, I'm looking for butter and salt
p219
aVand sexy things that make things taste less like penance.
p220
aVFor family, I'm looking for recipes
p221
aVthat genuflect to my own personal histories.
p222
aVFor community though, we start at the very beginning.
p223
aVThere's no escaping the fact
p224
aVthat everything we eat has a global impact.
p225
aVSo try and learn as best you can what that impact is
p226
aVand then take the first step to minimize it.
p227
aVWe've seen an image of our blue planet,
p228
aVour world bank.
p229
aVBut it is more than just a repository of our resources;
p230
aVit's also the global geography
p231
aVof the communion we call dinner.
p232
aVSo if we all take only what we need,
p233
aVthen we can begin to share the rest,
p234
aVwe can begin to celebrate,
p235
aVwe can begin to restore.
p236
aVWe need to savor vegetables.
p237
aVWe need to savor smaller portions of seafood.
p238
aVAnd we need to save dinner.
p239
