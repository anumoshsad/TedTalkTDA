VKhan Academy is most known for its collection of videos,
p4
aVso before I go any further,
p5
aVlet me show you a little bit of a montage.
p6
aa(lp7
V(Video) Salman Khan: So the hypotenuse is now going to be five.
p8
aVThis animal's fossils are only found in this area of South America \u2014
p9
aVa nice clean band here \u2014
p10
aVand this part of Africa.
p11
aVWe can integrate over the surface,
p12
aVand the notation usually is a capital sigma.
p13
aVNational Assembly: They create the Committee of Public Safety,
p14
aVwhich sounds like a very nice committee.
p15
aVNotice, this is an aldehyde, and it's an alcohol.
p16
aVStart differentiating into effector and memory cells.
p17
aVA galaxy. Hey! There's another galaxy. Oh, look! There's another galaxy.
p18
aVAnd for dollars, is their 30 million,
p19
aVplus the 20 million dollars from the American manufacturer.
p20
aVIf this does not blow your mind,
p21
aVthen you have no emotion.
p22
aa(lp23
V(Laughter)
p24
aa(lp25
V(Applause)
p26
aa(lp27
V(Live) SK: We now have on the order of 2,200 videos,
p28
aVcovering everything from basic arithmetic, all the way to vector calculus,
p29
aVand some of the stuff that you saw up there.
p30
aVWe have a million students a month using the site,
p31
aVwatching on the order of 100 to 200,000 videos a day.
p32
aVBut what we're going to talk about in this is how we're going to the next level.
p33
aVBut before I do that,
p34
aVI want to talk a little bit about really just how I got started.
p35
aVAnd some of you all might know,
p36
aVabout five years ago, I was an analyst at a hedge fund,
p37
aVand I was in Boston,
p38
aVand I was tutoring my cousins in New Orleans, remotely.
p39
aVAnd I started putting the first YouTube videos up,
p40
aVreally just as a kind of nice-to-have,
p41
aVjust kind of a supplement for my cousins,
p42
aVsomething that might give them a refresher or something.
p43
aa(lp44
VAnd as soon as I put those first YouTube videos up,
p45
aVsomething interesting happened.
p46
aVActually, a bunch of interesting things happened.
p47
aVThe first was the feedback from my cousins.
p48
aVThey told me that they preferred me on YouTube than in person.
p49
aa(lp50
V(Laughter)
p51
aa(lp52
VAnd once you get over the backhanded nature of that,
p53
aVthere was actually something very profound there.
p54
aVThey were saying that they preferred the automated version of their cousin
p55
aVto their cousin.
p56
aVAt first it's very unintuitive,
p57
aVbut when you think about it from their point of view, it makes a ton of sense.
p58
aVYou have this situation where now they can pause and repeat their cousin,
p59
aVwithout feeling like they're wasting my time.
p60
aVIf they have to review something
p61
aVthat they should have learned a couple of weeks ago,
p62
aVor maybe a couple of years ago,
p63
aVthey don't have to be embarrassed and ask their cousin.
p64
aVThey can just watch those videos; if they're bored, they can go ahead.
p65
aVThey can watch at their own time and pace.
p66
aVProbably the least-appreciated aspect of this
p67
aVis the notion that the very first time
p68
aVthat you're trying to get your brain around a new concept,
p69
aVthe very last thing you need
p70
aVis another human being saying, "Do you understand this?"
p71
aVAnd that's what was happening
p72
aVwith the interaction with my cousins before,
p73
aVand now they can just do it in the intimacy of their own room.
p74
aa(lp75
VThe other thing that happened is \u2014
p76
aVI put them on YouTube just \u2014
p77
aVI saw no reason to make it private,
p78
aVso I let other people watch it,
p79
aVand then people started stumbling on it,
p80
aVand I started getting some comments and some letters
p81
aVand all sorts of feedback
p82
aVfrom random people around the world.
p83
aVThese are just a few.
p84
aVThis is actually from one of the original calculus videos.
p85
aVSomeone wrote it on YouTube, it was a YouTube comment:
p86
aV"First time I smiled doing a derivative."
p87
aa(lp88
V(Laughter)
p89
aa(lp90
VLet's pause here.
p91
aVThis person did a derivative,
p92
aVand then they smiled.
p93
aa(lp94
V(Laughter)
p95
aa(lp96
VIn response to that same comment \u2014
p97
aVthis is on the thread, you can go on YouTube and look at the comments \u2014
p98
aVsomeone else wrote: "Same thing here.
p99
aVI actually got a natural high and a good mood for the entire day,
p100
aVsince I remember seeing all of this matrix text in class,
p101
aVand here I'm all like, 'I know kung fu.'"
p102
aa(lp103
V(Laughter)
p104
aa(lp105
VWe get a lot of feedback along those lines.
p106
aVThis clearly was helping people.
p107
aVBut then, as the viewership kept growing and kept growing,
p108
aVI started getting letters from people,
p109
aVand it was starting to become clear
p110
aVthat it was more than just a nice-to-have.
p111
aVThis is just an excerpt from one of those letters:
p112
aV"My 12 year-old son has autism,
p113
aVand has had a terrible time with math.
p114
aVWe have tried everything,
p115
aVviewed everything, bought everything.
p116
aVWe stumbled on your video on decimals, and it got through.
p117
aVThen we went on to the dreaded fractions.
p118
aVAgain, he got it.
p119
aVWe could not believe it.
p120
aVHe is so excited."
p121
aVAnd so you can imagine,
p122
aVhere I was, an analyst at a hedge fund \u2014
p123
aVit was very strange for me to do something of social value.
p124
aa(lp125
V(Laughter)
p126
aa(lp127
V(Applause)
p128
aa(lp129
VBut I was excited, so I kept going.
p130
aVAnd then a few other things started to dawn on me;
p131
aVthat not only would it help my cousins right now,
p132
aVor these people who were sending letters,
p133
aVbut that this content will never grow old,
p134
aVthat it could help their kids or their grandkids.
p135
aVIf Isaac Newton had done YouTube videos on calculus,
p136
aVI wouldn't have to.
p137
aa(lp138
V(Laughter)
p139
aa(lp140
VAssuming he was good. We don't know.
p141
aa(lp142
V(Laughter)
p143
aa(lp144
VThe other thing that happened \u2014 and even at this point, I said,
p145
aV"OK, maybe it's a good supplement. It's good for motivated students.
p146
aVIt's good for maybe home-schoolers."
p147
aVBut I didn't think it would somehow penetrate the classroom.
p148
aVThen I started getting letters from teachers,
p149
aVand the teachers would write, saying,
p150
aV"We've used your videos to flip the classroom.
p151
aVYou've given the lectures, so now what we do \u2014"
p152
aVAnd this could happen in every classroom in America tomorrow \u2014
p153
aV"what I do is I assign the lectures for homework,
p154
aVand what used to be homework,
p155
aVI now have the students doing in the classroom."
p156
aa(lp157
VAnd I want to pause here \u2014
p158
aa(lp159
V(Applause)
p160
aa(lp161
VI want to pause here, because there's a couple of interesting things.
p162
aVOne, when those teachers are doing that,
p163
aVthere's the obvious benefit \u2014
p164
aVthe benefit that now their students
p165
aVcan enjoy the videos in the way that my cousins did,
p166
aVthey can pause, repeat at their own pace, at their own time.
p167
aVBut the more interesting thing \u2014 and this is the unintuitive thing
p168
aVwhen you talk about technology in the classroom \u2014
p169
aVby removing the one-size-fits-all lecture from the classroom,
p170
aVand letting students have a self-paced lecture at home,
p171
aVthen when you go to the classroom,
p172
aVletting them do work, having the teacher walk around,
p173
aVhaving the peers actually be able to interact with each other,
p174
aVthese teachers have used technology to humanize the classroom.
p175
aVThey took a fundamentally dehumanizing experience \u2014
p176
aV30 kids with their fingers on their lips,
p177
aVnot allowed to interact with each other.
p178
aVA teacher, no matter how good,
p179
aVhas to give this one-size-fits-all lecture to 30 students \u2014
p180
aVblank faces, slightly antagonistic \u2014
p181
aVand now it's a human experience,
p182
aVnow they're actually interacting with each other.
p183
aa(lp184
VSo once the Khan Academy \u2014
p185
aVI quit my job,
p186
aVand we turned into a real organization \u2014
p187
aVwe're a not-for-profit \u2014
p188
aVthe question is, how do we take this to the next level?
p189
aVHow do we take what those teachers were doing to its natural conclusion?
p190
aVAnd so, what I'm showing over here,
p191
aVthese are actual exercises
p192
aVthat I started writing for my cousins.
p193
aVThe ones I started were much more primitive.
p194
aVThis is a more competent version of it.
p195
aVBut the paradigm here is, we'll generate as many questions as you need,
p196
aVuntil you get that concept, until you get 10 in a row.
p197
aVAnd the Khan Academy videos are there.
p198
aVYou get hints, the actual steps for that problem,
p199
aVif you don't know how to do it.
p200
aVThe paradigm here seems like a very simple thing:
p201
aV10 in a row, you move on.
p202
aVBut it's fundamentally different
p203
aVthan what's happening in classrooms right now.
p204
aa(lp205
VIn a traditional classroom,
p206
aVyou have homework, lecture, homework, lecture,
p207
aVand then you have a snapshot exam.
p208
aVAnd that exam, whether you get a 70 percent, an 80 percent,
p209
aVa 90 percent or a 95 percent,
p210
aVthe class moves on to the next topic.
p211
aVAnd even that 95 percent student \u2014
p212
aVwhat was the five percent they didn't know?
p213
aVMaybe they didn't know what happens when you raise something to the zeroth power.
p214
aVThen you build on that in the next concept.
p215
aVThat's analogous to \u2014 imagine learning to ride a bicycle.
p216
aVMaybe I give you a lecture ahead of time,
p217
aVand I give you a bicycle for two weeks, then I come back after two weeks,
p218
aVand say, "Well, let's see. You're having trouble taking left turns.
p219
aVYou can't quite stop. You're an 80 percent bicyclist."
p220
aVSo I put a big "C" stamp on your forehead \u2014
p221
aa(lp222
V(Laughter)
p223
aa(lp224
Vand then I say, "Here's a unicycle."
p225
aa(lp226
V(Laughter)
p227
aa(lp228
VBut as ridiculous as that sounds,
p229
aVthat's exactly what's happening in our classrooms right now.
p230
aVAnd the idea is you fast forward
p231
aVand good students start failing algebra all of the sudden,
p232
aVand start failing calculus all of the sudden,
p233
aVdespite being smart, despite having good teachers,
p234
aVand it's usually because they have these Swiss cheese gaps
p235
aVthat kept building throughout their foundation.
p236
aVSo our model is: learn math the way you'd learn anything,
p237
aVlike riding a bicycle.
p238
aVStay on that bicycle. Fall off that bicycle.
p239
aVDo it as long as necessary, until you have mastery.
p240
aVThe traditional model,
p241
aVit penalizes you for experimentation and failure,
p242
aVbut it does not expect mastery.
p243
aVWe encourage you to experiment. We encourage you to fail.
p244
aVBut we do expect mastery.
p245
aa(lp246
VThis is just another one of the modules.
p247
aVThis is trigonometry.
p248
aVThis is shifting and reflecting functions.
p249
aVAnd they all fit together.
p250
aVWe have about 90 of these right now.
p251
aVYou can go to the site right now,
p252
aVit's all free, not trying to sell anything.
p253
aVBut the general idea is that they all fit into this knowledge map.
p254
aVThat top node right there, that's literally single-digit addition,
p255
aVit's like one plus one is equal to two.
p256
aVThe paradigm is, once you get 10 in a row on that,
p257
aVit keeps forwarding you to more and more advanced modules.
p258
aa(lp259
VFurther down the knowledge map,
p260
aVwe're getting into more advanced arithmetic.
p261
aVFurther down, you start getting into pre-algebra and early algebra.
p262
aVFurther down, you start getting into algebra one, algebra two,
p263
aVa little bit of precalculus.
p264
aVAnd the idea is, from this we can actually teach everything \u2014
p265
aVwell, everything that can be taught in this type of a framework.
p266
aVSo you can imagine \u2014 and this is what we are working on \u2014
p267
aVfrom this knowledge map, you have logic, you have computer programming,
p268
aVyou have grammar, you have genetics,
p269
aVall based off of that core of, if you know this and that,
p270
aVnow you're ready for this next concept.
p271
aVNow that can work well for an individual learner,
p272
aVand I encourage you to do it with your kids,
p273
aVbut I also encourage everyone in the audience to do it yourself.
p274
aVIt'll change what happens at the dinner table.
p275
aa(lp276
VBut what we want to do
p277
aVis use the natural conclusion of the flipping of the classroom
p278
aVthat those early teachers had emailed me about.
p279
aVAnd so what I'm showing you here,
p280
aVthis is data from a pilot in the Los Altos school district,
p281
aVwhere they took two fifth-grade classes and two seventh-grade classes,
p282
aVand completely gutted their old math curriculum.
p283
aVThese kids aren't using textbooks, or getting one-size-fits-all lectures.
p284
aVThey're doing Khan Academy, that software, for roughly half of their math class.
p285
aVI want to be clear: we don't view this as a complete math education.
p286
aVWhat it does is \u2014 this is what's happening in Los Altos \u2014
p287
aVit frees up time \u2014 it's the blocking and tackling,
p288
aVmaking sure you know how to move through a system of equations,
p289
aVand it frees up time for the simulations, for the games,
p290
aVfor the mechanics, for the robot-building,
p291
aVfor the estimating how high that hill is based on its shadow.
p292
aa(lp293
VAnd so the paradigm is the teacher walks in every day,
p294
aVevery kid works at their own pace \u2014
p295
aVthis is actually a live dashboard from the Los Altos school district \u2014
p296
aVand they look at this dashboard.
p297
aVEvery row is a student.
p298
aVEvery column is one of those concepts.
p299
aVGreen means the student's already proficient.
p300
aVBlue means they're working on it \u2014 no need to worry.
p301
aVRed means they're stuck.
p302
aVAnd what the teacher does is literally just say,
p303
aV"Let me intervene on the red kids."
p304
aVOr even better, "Let me get one of the green kids,
p305
aVwho are already proficient in that concept,
p306
aVto be the first line of attack, and actually tutor their peer."
p307
aa(lp308
V(Applause)
p309
aa(lp310
VNow, I come from a very data-centric reality,
p311
aVso we don't want that teacher to even go and intervene
p312
aVand have to ask the kid awkward questions:
p313
aV"What don't you understand? What do you understand?" and all the rest.
p314
aVSo our paradigm is to arm teachers with as much data as possible \u2014
p315
aVdata that, in any other field, is expected,
p316
aVin finance, marketing, manufacturing \u2014
p317
aVso the teachers can diagnose what's wrong with the students
p318
aVso they can make their interaction as productive as possible.
p319
aVNow teachers know exactly what the students have been up to,
p320
aVhow long they've spent each day, what videos they've watched,
p321
aVwhen did they pause the videos, what did they stop watching,
p322
aVwhat exercises are they using, what have they focused on?
p323
aVThe outer circle shows what exercises they were focused on.
p324
aVThe inner circle shows the videos they're focused on.
p325
aVThe data gets pretty granular,
p326
aVso you can see the exact problems the student got right or wrong.
p327
aVRed is wrong, blue is right.
p328
aVThe leftmost question is the first one the student attempted.
p329
aVThey watched the video over there.
p330
aVAnd you can see, eventually they were able to get 10 in a row.
p331
aVIt's almost like you can see them learning over those last 10 problems.
p332
aVThey also got faster \u2014 the height is how long it took them.
p333
aa(lp334
VWhen you talk about self-paced learning, it makes sense for everyone \u2014
p335
aVin education-speak, "differentiated learning" \u2014
p336
aVbut it's kind of crazy, what happens when you see it in a classroom.
p337
aVBecause every time we've done this, in every classroom we've done,
p338
aVover and over again, if you go five days into it,
p339
aVthere's a group of kids who've raced ahead
p340
aVand a group who are a little bit slower.
p341
aVIn a traditional model, in a snapshot assessment,
p342
aVyou say, "These are the gifted kids, these are the slow kids.
p343
aVMaybe they should be tracked differently.
p344
aVMaybe we should put them in different classes."
p345
aVBut when you let students work at their own pace \u2014
p346
aVwe see it over and over again \u2014
p347
aVyou see students who took a little bit extra time
p348
aVon one concept or the other,
p349
aVbut once they get through that concept,
p350
aVthey just race ahead.
p351
aVAnd so the same kids that you thought were slow six weeks ago,
p352
aVyou now would think are gifted.
p353
aVAnd we're seeing it over and over again.
p354
aVIt makes you really wonder
p355
aVhow much all of the labels maybe a lot of us have benefited from
p356
aVwere really just due to a coincidence of time.
p357
aa(lp358
VNow as valuable as something like this is in a district like Los Altos,
p359
aVour goal is to use technology
p360
aVto humanize, not just in Los Altos, but on a global scale,
p361
aVwhat's happening in education.
p362
aVAnd that brings up an interesting point.
p363
aVA lot of the effort in humanizing the classroom
p364
aVis focused on student-to-teacher ratios.
p365
aVIn our mind, the relevant metric is:
p366
aVstudent-to-valuable-human-time- with-the-teacher ratio.
p367
aVSo in a traditional model, most of the teacher's time
p368
aVis spent doing lectures and grading and whatnot.
p369
aVMaybe five percent of their time is sitting next to students
p370
aVand working with them.
p371
aVNow, 100 percent of their time is.
p372
aVSo once again, using technology, not just flipping the classroom,
p373
aVyou're humanizing the classroom, I'd argue,
p374
aVby a factor of five or 10.
p375
aa(lp376
VAs valuable as that is in Los Altos,
p377
aVimagine what it does to the adult learner,
p378
aVwho's embarrassed to go back and learn stuff
p379
aVthey should have known before going back to college.
p380
aVImagine what it does to a street kid in Calcutta,
p381
aVwho has to help his family during the day,
p382
aVand that's the reason he or she can't go to school.
p383
aVNow they can spend two hours a day and remediate,
p384
aVor get up to speed and not feel embarrassed
p385
aVabout what they do or don't know.
p386
aVNow imagine what happens where \u2014
p387
aVwe talked about the peers teaching each other
p388
aVinside of a classroom.
p389
aVBut this is all one system.
p390
aVThere's no reason why you can't have that peer-to-peer tutoring
p391
aVbeyond that one classroom.
p392
aVImagine what happens if that student in Calcutta
p393
aVall of the sudden can tutor your son,
p394
aVor your son can tutor that kid in Calcutta.
p395
aVAnd I think what you'll see emerging
p396
aVis this notion of a global one-world classroom.
p397
aVAnd that's essentially what we're trying to build.
p398
aa(lp399
VThank you.
p400
aa(lp401
V(Applause)
p402
aa(lp403
VBill Gates: I'll ask about two or three questions.
p404
aa(lp405
VSalman Khan: Oh, OK.
p406
aa(lp407
V(Applause continues)
p408
aa(lp409
V(Applause ends)
p410
aa(lp411
VBG: I've seen some things you're doing in the system,
p412
aVthat have to do with motivation and feedback \u2014
p413
aVenergy points, merit badges.
p414
aVTell me what you're thinking there.
p415
aa(lp416
VSK: Oh yeah. No, we have an awesome team working on it.
p417
aVI have to be clear, it's not just me anymore.
p418
aVI'm still doing all the videos,
p419
aVbut we have a rock-star team doing the software.
p420
aVWe've put a bunch of game mechanics in there, where you get badges,
p421
aVwe're going to start having leader boards by area, you get points.
p422
aVIt's actually been pretty interesting.
p423
aVJust the wording of the badging,
p424
aVor how many points you get for doing something,
p425
aVwe see on a system-wide basis,
p426
aVlike tens of thousands of fifth-graders or sixth-graders
p427
aVgoing one direction or another, depending what badge you give them.
p428
aa(lp429
V(Laughter)
p430
aa(lp431
VBG: And the collaboration you're doing with Los Altos,
p432
aVhow did that come about?
p433
aa(lp434
VSK: Los Altos, it was kind of crazy.
p435
aVOnce again, I didn't expect it to be used in classrooms.
p436
aVSomeone from their board came and said,
p437
aV"What would you do if you had carte Blanche in a classroom?"
p438
aVI said, "Well, every student would work at their own pace,
p439
aVon something like this, we'd give a dashboard."
p440
aVThey said, "This is kind of radical. We have to think about it."
p441
aVMe and the rest of the team were like, "They're never going to want to do this."
p442
aVBut literally the next day they were like, "Can you start in two weeks?"
p443
aa(lp444
V(Laughter)
p445
aa(lp446
VBG: So fifth-grade math is where that's going on right now?
p447
aa(lp448
VSK: It's two fifth-grade classes and two seventh-grade classes.
p449
aVThey're doing it at the district level.
p450
aVI think what they're excited about is they can follow these kids,
p451
aVnot only in school; on Christmas, we saw some of the kids were doing it.
p452
aVWe can track everything, track them as they go through the entire district.
p453
aVThrough the summers, as they go from one teacher to the next,
p454
aVyou have this continuity of data that even at the district level, they can see.
p455
aa(lp456
VBG: So some of those views we saw were for the teacher
p457
aVto go in and track actually what's going on with those kids.
p458
aVSo you're getting feedback on those teacher views
p459
aVto see what they think they need?
p460
aa(lp461
VSK: Oh yeah. Most of those were specs by the teachers.
p462
aVWe made some of those for students so they could see their data,
p463
aVbut we have a very tight design loop with the teachers themselves.
p464
aVAnd they're saying, "Hey, this is nice, but \u2014"
p465
aVLike that focus graph, a lot of the teachers said,
p466
aV"I have a feeling a lot of the kids are jumping around
p467
aVand not focusing on one topic."
p468
aVSo we made that focus diagram.
p469
aVSo it's all been teacher-driven. It's been pretty crazy.
p470
aa(lp471
VBG: Is this ready for prime time?
p472
aVDo you think a lot of classes next school year should try this thing out?
p473
aa(lp474
VSK: Yeah, it's ready.
p475
aVWe've got a million people on the site already,
p476
aVso we can handle a few more.
p477
aa(lp478
V(Laughter)
p479
aa(lp480
VNo, no reason why it really can't happen
p481
aVin every classroom in America tomorrow.
p482
aa(lp483
VBG: And the vision of the tutoring thing.
p484
aVThe idea there is, if I'm confused about a topic,
p485
aVsomehow right in the user interface,
p486
aVI'd find people who are volunteering,
p487
aVmaybe see their reputation,
p488
aVand I could schedule and connect up with those people?
p489
aa(lp490
VSK: Absolutely. And this is something I recommend everyone in this audience do.
p491
aVThose dashboards the teachers have, you can go log in right now
p492
aVand you can essentially become a coach
p493
aVfor your kids, your nephews, your cousins,
p494
aVor maybe some kids at the Boys and Girls Club.
p495
aVAnd yeah, you can start becoming a mentor, a tutor,
p496
aVreally immediately.
p497
aVBut yeah, it's all there.
p498
aa(lp499
VBG: Well, it's amazing.
p500
aVI think you just got a glimpse of the future of education.
p501
aa(lp502
VBG: Thank you. SK: Thank you.
