VI, like many of you,
p4
aVam one of the two billion people on Earth who live in cities.
p5
aVAnd there are days \u2014 I don't know about the rest of you \u2014
p6
aVbut there are days when I palpably feel
p7
aVhow much I rely on other people
p8
aVfor pretty much everything in my life.
p9
aVAnd some days, that can even be a little scary.
p10
aVBut what I'm here to talk to you about today
p11
aVis how that same interdependence
p12
aVis actually an extremely powerful social infrastructure
p13
aVthat we can actually harness
p14
aVto help heal some of our deepest civic issues,
p15
aVif we apply open-source collaboration.
p16
aa(lp17
VA couple of years ago,
p18
aVI read an article by New York Times writer Michael Pollan,
p19
aVin which he argued that growing even some of our own food
p20
aVis one of the best things that we can do for the environment.
p21
aVNow at the time that I was reading this,
p22
aVit was the middle of the winter
p23
aVand I definitely did not have room for a lot of dirt
p24
aVin my New York City apartment.
p25
aVSo I was basically just willing to settle
p26
aVfor just reading the next Wired magazine
p27
aVand finding out how the experts were going to figure out
p28
aVhow to solve all these problems for us in the future.
p29
aVBut that was actually exactly the point
p30
aVthat Michael Pollan was making in this article \u2014
p31
aVit's precisely when we hand over
p32
aVthe responsibility for all these things to specialists
p33
aVthat we cause the kind of messes that we see with the food system.
p34
aa(lp35
VSo, I happen to know a little bit from my own work
p36
aVabout how NASA has been using hydroponics
p37
aVto explore growing food in space.
p38
aVAnd that you can actually get optimal nutritional yield
p39
aVby running a kind of high-quality liquid soil over plants' root systems.
p40
aVNow to a vegetable plant,
p41
aVmy apartment has got to be about as foreign as outer space.
p42
aVBut I can offer some natural light
p43
aVand year-round climate control.
p44
aa(lp45
VFast-forward two years later:
p46
aVwe now have window farms,
p47
aVwhich are vertical, hydroponic platforms
p48
aVfor food-growing indoors.
p49
aVAnd the way it works is that there's a pump at the bottom,
p50
aVwhich periodically sends this liquid nutrient solution up to the top,
p51
aVwhich then trickles down through plants' root systems
p52
aVthat are suspended in clay pellets \u2014
p53
aVso there's no dirt involved.
p54
aVNow light and temperature vary with each window's microclimate,
p55
aVso a window farm requires a farmer,
p56
aVand she must decide
p57
aVwhat kind of crops she is going to put in her window farm,
p58
aVand whether she is going to feed her food organically.
p59
aa(lp60
VBack at the time,
p61
aVa window farm was no more than a technically complex idea
p62
aVthat was going to require a lot of testing.
p63
aVAnd I really wanted it to be an open project,
p64
aVbecause hydroponics
p65
aVis one of the fastest growing areas of patenting
p66
aVin the United States right now,
p67
aVand could possibly become another area like Monsanto,
p68
aVwhere we have a lot of corporate intellectual property
p69
aVin the way of people's food.
p70
aVSo I decided that, instead of creating a product,
p71
aVwhat I was going to do
p72
aVwas open this up to a whole bunch of codevelopers.
p73
aa(lp74
VThe first few systems that we created, they kind of worked.
p75
aVWe were actually able to grow about a salad a week
p76
aVin a typical New York City apartment window.
p77
aVAnd we were able to grow cherry tomatoes
p78
aVand cucumbers, all kinds of stuff.
p79
aVBut the first few systems
p80
aVwere these leaky, loud power-guzzlers
p81
aVthat Martha Stewart would definitely never have approved.
p82
aa(lp83
V(Laughter)
p84
aa(lp85
VSo to bring on more codevelopers,
p86
aVwhat we did was we created a social media site
p87
aVon which we published the designs,
p88
aVwe explained how they worked,
p89
aVand we even went so far
p90
aVas to point out everything that was wrong with these systems.
p91
aVAnd then we invited people all over the world
p92
aVto build them and experiment with us.
p93
aVSo actually now on this website,
p94
aVwe have 18,000 people.
p95
aVAnd we have window farms all over the world.
p96
aa(lp97
VWhat we're doing is what NASA or a large corporation
p98
aVwould call R&D, or research and development.
p99
aVBut what we call it is R&D-I-Y,
p100
aVor "research and develop it yourself."
p101
aa(lp102
V(Laughter)
p103
aa(lp104
VSo, for example, Jackson came along
p105
aVand suggested that we use air pumps instead of water pumps.
p106
aVIt took building a whole bunch of systems to get it right,
p107
aVbut once we did, we were able to cut our carbon footprint nearly in half.
p108
aVTony in Chicago has been taking on growing experiments,
p109
aVlike lots of other window farmers,
p110
aVand he's been able to get his strawberries to fruit
p111
aVfor nine months of the year in low-light conditions
p112
aVby simply changing out the organic nutrients.
p113
aVAnd window farmers in Finland have been customizing their window farms
p114
aVfor the dark days of the Finnish winters
p115
aVby outfitting them with LED grow lights
p116
aVthat they're now making open source and part of the project.
p117
aa(lp118
VSo window farms have been evolving
p119
aVthrough a rapid versioning process similar to software.
p120
aVAnd with every open source project,
p121
aVthe real benefit is the interplay
p122
aVbetween the specific concerns of people customizing their systems
p123
aVfor their own particular concerns,
p124
aVand the universal concerns.
p125
aVSo my core team and I
p126
aVare able to concentrate on the improvements
p127
aVthat really benefit everyone.
p128
aVAnd we're able to look out for the needs of newcomers.
p129
aa(lp130
VSo for do-it-yourselfers,
p131
aVwe provide free, very well-tested instructions
p132
aVso that anyone, anywhere around the world,
p133
aVcan build one of these systems for free.
p134
aVAnd there's a patent pending on these systems as well
p135
aVthat's held by the community.
p136
aVAnd to fund the project,
p137
aVwe partner to create products
p138
aVthat we then sell to schools and to individuals
p139
aVwho don't have time to build their own systems.
p140
aa(lp141
VNow within our community, a certain culture has appeared.
p142
aVIn our culture, it is better to be a tester
p143
aVwho supports someone else's idea
p144
aVthan it is to be just the idea guy.
p145
aVWhat we get out of this project is support for our own work,
p146
aVas well as an experience of actually contributing
p147
aVto the environmental movement
p148
aVin a way other than just screwing in new light bulbs.
p149
aVBut I think that Eleen expresses best
p150
aVwhat we really get out of this,
p151
aVwhich is the actual joy of collaboration.
p152
aVSo she expresses here what it's like
p153
aVto see someone halfway across the world
p154
aVhaving taken your idea, built upon it
p155
aVand then acknowledging you for contributing.
p156
aVIf we really want to see the kind of wide consumer behavior change
p157
aVthat we're all talking about as environmentalists and food people,
p158
aVmaybe we just need to ditch the term "consumer"
p159
aVand get behind the people who are doing stuff.
p160
aa(lp161
VOpen source projects tend to have a momentum of their own.
p162
aVAnd what we're seeing is that R&D-I-Y
p163
aVhas moved beyond just window farms and LEDs
p164
aVinto solar panels and aquaponic systems.
p165
aVAnd we're building upon innovations of generations who went before us.
p166
aVAnd we're looking ahead at generations
p167
aVwho really need us to retool our lives now.
p168
aVSo we ask that you join us
p169
aVin rediscovering the value of citizens united,
p170
aVand to declare that we are all still pioneers.
