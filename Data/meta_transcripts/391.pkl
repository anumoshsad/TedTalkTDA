p6
aa(lp7
VThank you for being here.
p8
aVAnd I say "thank you for being here" because I was silent for 17 years.
p9
aVAnd the first words that I spoke were in Washington, D.C.,
p10
aVon the 20th anniversary of Earth Day.
p11
aVAnd my family and friends had gathered there to hear me speak.
p12
aVAnd I said, "Thank you for being here."
p13
aVMy mother, out in the audience, she jumped up,
p14
aV"Hallelujah, Johnny\u2019s talking!"
p15
aa(lp16
V(Laughter)
p17
aa(lp18
VImagine if you were quiet for 17 years
p19
aVand your mother was out in the audience, say.
p20
aVMy dad said to me, "That\u2019s one" \u2014
p21
aVI\u2019ll explain that.
p22
aVBut I turned around because I didn\u2019t recognize where my voice was coming from.
p23
aVI hadn\u2019t heard my voice in 17 years,
p24
aVso I turned around and I looked and I said,
p25
aV"God, who's saying what I\u2019m thinking?"
p26
aVAnd then I realized it was me, you know, and I kind of laughed.
p27
aVAnd I could see my father: "Yeah, he really is crazy."
p28
aVWell, I want to take you on this journey.
p29
aVAnd the journey, I believe, is a metaphor for all of our journeys.
p30
aVEven though this one is kind of unusual,
p31
aVI want you to think about your own journey.
p32
aa(lp33
VMy journey began in 1971
p34
aVwhen I witnessed two oil tankers collide beneath the Golden Gate,
p35
aVand a half a million gallons of oil spilled into the bay.
p36
aVIt disturbed me so much
p37
aVthat I decided that I was going to give up riding and driving in motorized vehicles.
p38
aVThat\u2019s a big thing in California.
p39
aVAnd it was a big thing in my little community of Point Reyes Station
p40
aVin Inverness, California, because there were only
p41
aVabout 350 people there in the winter \u2013 this was back in '71 now.
p42
aVAnd so when I came in and I started walking around, people \u2014
p43
aVthey just knew what was going on.
p44
aVAnd people would drive up next to me
p45
aVand say, "John, what are you doing?"
p46
aVAnd I\u2019d say, "Well, I\u2019m walking for the environment."
p47
aVAnd they said, "No, you\u2019re walking to make us look bad, right?
p48
aVYou\u2019re walking to make us feel bad."
p49
aVAnd maybe there was some truth to that,
p50
aVbecause I thought that if I started walking, everyone would follow.
p51
aVBecause of the oil, everybody talked about the polllution.
p52
aVAnd so I argued with people about that, I argued and I argued.
p53
aVI called my parents up.
p54
aVI said, "I\u2019ve given up riding and driving in cars."
p55
aVMy dad said, "Why didn\u2019t you do that when you were 16?"
p56
aa(lp57
V(Laughter)
p58
aa(lp59
VI didn\u2019t know about the environment then.
p60
aVThey\u2019re back in Philadelphia.
p61
aVAnd so I told my mother, "I\u2019m happy though, I\u2019m really happy."
p62
aVShe said, "If you were happy, son, you wouldn\u2019t have to say it."
p63
aVMothers are like that.
p64
aa(lp65
VAnd so, on my 27th birthday I decided, because I argued so much
p66
aVand I talk so much, that I was going to stop speaking
p67
aVfor just one day \u2014 one day \u2014 to give it a rest.
p68
aVAnd so I did.
p69
aVI got up in the morning and I didn\u2019t say a word.
p70
aVAnd I have to tell you, it was a very moving experience,
p71
aVbecause for the first time, I began listening \u2014 in a long time.
p72
aVAnd what I heard, it kind of disturbed me.
p73
aVBecause what I used to do, when I thought I was listening,
p74
aVwas I would listen just enough to hear what people had to say
p75
aVand think that I could \u2014 I knew what they were going to say,
p76
aVand so I stopped listening.
p77
aVAnd in my mind, I just kind of raced ahead
p78
aVand thought of what I was going to say back,
p79
aVwhile they were still finishing up.
p80
aVAnd then I would launch in.
p81
aVWell, that just ended communication.
p82
aa(lp83
VSo on this first day I actually listened.
p84
aVAnd it was very sad for me,
p85
aVbecause I realized that for those many years I had not been learning.
p86
aVI was 27. I thought I knew everything.
p87
aVI didn\u2019t.
p88
aVAnd so I decided I\u2019d better do this for another day,
p89
aVand another day, and another day until finally,
p90
aVI promised myself for a year I would keep quiet
p91
aVbecause I started learning more and more and I needed to learn more.
p92
aVSo for a year I said I would keep quiet,
p93
aVand then on my birthday I would reassess what I had learned
p94
aVand maybe I would talk again.
p95
aVWell, that lasted 17 years.
p96
aa(lp97
VNow during that time \u2014 those 17 years \u2014 I walked and I played the banjo
p98
aVand I painted and I wrote in my journal, and
p99
aVI tried to study the environment by reading books.
p100
aVAnd I decided that I was going to go to school. So I did.
p101
aVI walked up to Ashland, Oregon,
p102
aVwhere they were offering an environmental studies degree.
p103
aVIt\u2019s only 500 miles.
p104
aVAnd I went into the Registrar\u2019s office and \u2014
p105
aV"What, what, what?"
p106
aVI had a newspaper clipping.
p107
aV"Oh, so you really want to go to school here?
p108
aVYou don\u2019t \u2026?
p109
aVWe have a special program for you." They did.
p110
aVAnd in those two years, I graduated with my first degree \u2014 a bachelor\u2019s degree.
p111
aVAnd my father came out, he was so proud.
p112
aVHe said, "Listen, we\u2019re really proud of you son,
p113
aVbut what are you going to do with a bachelor\u2019s degree?
p114
aVYou don\u2019t ride in cars, you don\u2019t talk \u2014
p115
aVyou\u2019re going to have to do those things."
p116
aa(lp117
V(Laughter)
p118
aa(lp119
VI hunched my shoulder, I picked my backpack up again
p120
aVand I started walking.
p121
aVI walked all the way up to Port Townsend, Washington, where I built a wooden boat,
p122
aVrode it across Puget Sound
p123
aVand walked across Washington [to] Idaho and down to Missoula, Montana.
p124
aVI had written the University of Montana two years earlier
p125
aVand said I'd like to go to school there.
p126
aVI said I'd be there in about two years.
p127
aa(lp128
V(Laughter)
p129
aa(lp130
VAnd I was there. I showed up in two years and they \u2014
p131
aVI tell this story because they really helped me.
p132
aVThere are two stories in Montana.
p133
aVThe first story is I didn\u2019t have any money \u2014 that\u2019s a sign I used a lot.
p134
aVAnd they said,"Don't worry about that."
p135
aVThe director of the program said, "Come back tomorrow."
p136
aVHe gave me 150 dollars,
p137
aVand he said, "Register for one credit.
p138
aVYou\u2019re going to go to South America, aren\u2019t you?"
p139
aVAnd I said \u2014
p140
aVRivers and lakes, the hydrological systems, South America.
p141
aVSo I did that.
p142
aVHe came back; he said to me,
p143
aV"OK John, now that you've registered for that one credit,
p144
aVyou can have a key to an office, you can matriculate \u2014
p145
aVyou\u2019re matriculating, so you can use the library.
p146
aVAnd what we\u2019re going to do
p147
aVis, we\u2019re going to have all of the professors allow you to go to class.
p148
aVThey\u2019re going to save your grade,
p149
aVand when we figure out how to get you the rest of the money,
p150
aVthen you can register for that class and they\u2019ll give you the grade."
p151
aVWow, they don\u2019t do that in graduate schools, I don\u2019t think.
p152
aVBut I use that story because they really wanted to help me.
p153
aVThey saw that I was really interested in the environment,
p154
aVand they really wanted to help me along the way.
p155
aa(lp156
VAnd during that time, I actually taught classes without speaking.
p157
aVI had 13 students when I first walked into the class.
p158
aVI explained, with a friend who could interpret my sign language,
p159
aVthat I was John Francis, I was walking around the world,
p160
aVI didn\u2019t talk and this was the last time
p161
aVthis person\u2019s going to be here interpreting for me.
p162
aVAll the students sat around and they went ...
p163
aa(lp164
V(Laughter)
p165
aa(lp166
VI could see they were looking for the schedule,
p167
aVto see when they could get out.
p168
aVThey had to take that class with me.
p169
aVTwo weeks later, everyone was trying to get into our class.
p170
aa(lp171
VAnd I learned in that class \u2014 because I would do things like this ...
p172
aVand they were all gathered around, going, "What's he trying to say?"
p173
aV"I don't know, I think he's talking about clear cutting." "Yeah, clear cutting."
p174
aV"No, no, no, that's not clear cutting, that\u2019s \u2014 he's using a handsaw."
p175
aV"Well, you can\u2019t clearcut with a ..."
p176
aV"Yes, you can clear cut ..."
p177
aV"No, I think he\u2019s talking about selective forestry."
p178
aVNow this was a discussion class and we were having a discussion.
p179
aVI just backed out of that, you know, and I just kind of kept the fists from flying.
p180
aVBut what I learned was that sometimes I would make a sign
p181
aVand they said things that I absolutely did not mean,
p182
aVbut I should have.
p183
aVAnd so what came to me is, if you were a teacher
p184
aVand you were teaching, if you weren\u2019t learning
p185
aVyou probably weren\u2019t teaching very well.
p186
aVAnd so I went on.
p187
aa(lp188
VMy dad came out to see me graduate
p189
aVand, you know, I did the deal,
p190
aVand my father said, "We\u2019re really proud of you son, but ... "
p191
aVYou know what went on,
p192
aVhe said, "You\u2019ve got to start riding and driving and start talking.
p193
aVWhat are you going to do with a master\u2019s degree?"
p194
aVI hunched my shoulder, I got my backpack
p195
aVand I went on to the University of Wisconsin.
p196
aa(lp197
VI spent two years there writing on oil spills.
p198
aVNo one was interested in oil spills.
p199
aVBut something happened \u2014
p200
aVExxon Valdez.
p201
aVAnd I was the only one in the United States writing on oil spills.
p202
aVMy dad came out again.
p203
aVHe said, "I don't know how you do this, son \u2014
p204
aVI mean, you don't ride in cars, you don\u2019t talk.
p205
aVMy sister said maybe I should leave you alone,
p206
aVbecause you seem to be doing a lot better
p207
aVwhen you\u2019re not saying anything."
p208
aa(lp209
V(Laughter)
p210
aa(lp211
VWell, I put on my backpack again.
p212
aVI put my banjo on and I walked all the way to the East Coast,
p213
aVput my foot in the Atlantic Ocean \u2014
p214
aVit was seven years and one day it took me to walk across the United States.
p215
aa(lp216
VAnd on Earth Day, 1990 \u2014
p217
aVthe 20th anniversary of Earth Day \u2014 that\u2019s when I began to speak.
p218
aVAnd that\u2019s why I said, "Thank you for being here."
p219
aVBecause it's sort of like that tree in the forest falling;
p220
aVand if there's no one there to hear, does it really make a sound?
p221
aVAnd I\u2019m thanking you, and I'm thanking my family
p222
aVbecause they had come to hear me speak.
p223
aVAnd that\u2019s communication.
p224
aVAnd they also taught me about listening \u2014 that they listened to me.
p225
aVAnd it\u2019s one of those things that came out of the silence,
p226
aVthe listening to each other.
p227
aVReally, very important \u2014
p228
aVwe need to listen to each other.
p229
aVWell, my journey kept going on.
p230
aVMy dad said, "That\u2019s one,"
p231
aVand I still didn\u2019t let that go.
p232
aa(lp233
VI worked for the Coastguard, was made a U.N. Goodwill Ambassador.
p234
aVI wrote regulations for the United States \u2014
p235
aVI mean, I wrote oil spill regulations.
p236
aV20 years ago, if someone had said to me,
p237
aV"John, do you really want to make a difference?"
p238
aV"Yeah, I want to make a difference."
p239
aVHe said, "You just start walking east;
p240
aVget out of your car and just start walking east."
p241
aVAnd as I walked off a little bit, they'd say, "Yeah, and shut up, too."
p242
aa(lp243
V(Laughter)
p244
aa(lp245
V"You\u2019re going to make a difference, buddy."
p246
aVHow could that be, how could that be?
p247
aVHow could doing such a simple thing like walking and not talking
p248
aVmake a difference?
p249
aa(lp250
VWell, my time at the Coast Guard was a really good time.
p251
aVAnd after that \u2014 I only worked one year \u2014
p252
aVI said, "That's enough. One year's enough for me to do that."
p253
aVI got on a sailboat and I sailed down to the Caribbean,
p254
aVand walked through all of the islands, and to Venezuela.
p255
aVAnd you know, I forgot the most important thing,
p256
aVwhich is why I started talking, which I have to tell you.
p257
aVI started talking because I had studied environment.
p258
aVI\u2019d studied environment at this formal level,
p259
aVbut there was this informal level.
p260
aVAnd the informal level \u2014
p261
aVI learned about people, and what we do and how we are.
p262
aVAnd environment changed from just being about trees and birds
p263
aVand endangered species to being about how we treated each other.
p264
aVBecause if we are the environment,
p265
aVthen all we need to do is look around us
p266
aVand see how we treat ourselves and how we treat each other.
p267
aVAnd so that\u2019s the message that I had.
p268
aVAnd I said, "Well, I'm going to have to spread that message."
p269
aVAnd I got in my sailboat, sailed all the way through the Caribbean \u2014
p270
aVit wasn't really my sailboat, I kind of worked on that boat \u2014
p271
aVgot to Venezuela and I started walking.
p272
aa(lp273
VThis is the last part of this story, because it\u2019s how I got here,
p274
aVbecause I still didn't ride in motorized vehicles.
p275
aVI was walking through El Dorado \u2014 it's a prison town, famous prison,
p276
aVor infamous prison \u2014 in Venezuela, and I don\u2019t know what possessed me,
p277
aVbecause this was not like me.
p278
aVThere I am, walking past the guard gate and the guard stops and says,
p279
aV"Pasaporte, pasaporte," and with an M16 pointed at me.
p280
aVAnd I looked at him and I said, "Passport, huh?
p281
aVI don't need to show you my passport. It\u2019s in the back of my pack.
p282
aVI'm Dr. Francis; I'm a U.N. Ambassador and I'm walking around the world."
p283
aVAnd I started walking off.
p284
aVWhat possessed me to say this thing?
p285
aVThe road turned into the jungle.
p286
aVI didn\u2019t get shot.
p287
aVAnd I got to \u2014 I start saying, "Free at last \u2014
p288
aVthank God Almighty, I\u2019m free at last."
p289
aV"What was that about," I\u2019m saying. What was that about?
p290
aa(lp291
VIt took me 100 miles to figure out that, in my heart, in me,
p292
aVI had become a prisoner.
p293
aVI was a prisoner and I needed to escape.
p294
aVThe prison that I was in was the fact that I did not drive
p295
aVor use motorized vehicles.
p296
aVNow how could that be?
p297
aVBecause when I started, it seemed very appropriate to me
p298
aVnot to use motorized vehicles.
p299
aVBut the thing that was different
p300
aVwas that every birthday, I asked myself about silence,
p301
aVbut I never asked myself about my decision to just use my feet.
p302
aVI had no idea I was going to become a U.N. Ambassador.
p303
aVI had no idea I would have a Ph.D.
p304
aa(lp305
VAnd so I realized that I had a responsibility to more than just me,
p306
aVand that I was going to have to change.
p307
aVYou know, we can do it.
p308
aVI was going to have to change.
p309
aVAnd I was afraid to change,
p310
aVbecause I was so used to the guy who only just walked.
p311
aVI was so used to that person that I didn\u2019t want to stop.
p312
aVI didn\u2019t know who I would be if I changed.
p313
aVBut I know I needed to.
p314
aVI know I needed to change, because it would be the only way
p315
aVthat I could be here today.
p316
aVAnd I know that a lot of times
p317
aVwe find ourselves in this wonderful place where we\u2019ve gotten to,
p318
aVbut there\u2019s another place for us to go.
p319
aVAnd we kind of have to leave behind the security of who we\u2019ve become,
p320
aVand go to the place of who we are becoming.
p321
aVAnd so, I want to encourage you to go to that next place,
p322
aVto let yourself out of any prison that you might find yourself in,
p323
aVas comfortable as it may be, because we have to do something now.
p324
aVWe have to change now.
p325
aVAs our former Vice President said,
p326
aVwe have to become activists.
p327
aVSo if my voice can touch you,
p328
aVif my actions can touch you, if my being here can touch you,
p329
aVplease let it be.
p330
aVAnd I know that all of you have touched me
p331
aVwhile I\u2019ve been here.
p332
aa(lp333
VSo, let\u2019s go out into the world
p334
aVand take this caring, this love, this respect
p335
aVthat we\u2019ve shown each other right here at TED,
p336
aVand take this out into the world.
p337
aVBecause we are the environment,
p338
aVand how we treat each other
p339
aVis really how we\u2019re going to treat the environment.
p340
aVSo I want to thank you for being here
p341
aVand I want to end this in five seconds of silence.
p342
aa(lp343
VThank you.
