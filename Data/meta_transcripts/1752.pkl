VI'm almost like a crazy evangelical.
p4
aVI've always known that the age of design is upon us,
p5
aValmost like a rapture.
p6
aVIf the day is sunny, I think,
p7
aV"Oh, the gods have had a good design day."
p8
aVOr, I go to a show and I see a beautiful piece by an artist,
p9
aVparticularly beautiful, I say
p10
aVhe's so good because he clearly looked to design
p11
aVto understand what he needed to do.
p12
aa(lp13
VSo I really do believe that design
p14
aVis the highest form of creative expression.
p15
aVThat's why I'm talking to you today about the age of design,
p16
aVand the age of design is the age in which design
p17
aVis still cute furniture, is still posters,
p18
aVis still fast cars, what you see at MoMA today.
p19
aVBut in truth, what I really would like to explain
p20
aVto the public and to the audiences of MoMA is that
p21
aVthe most interesting chairs are the ones
p22
aVthat are actually made by a robot,
p23
aVlike this beautiful chair by Dirk Vander Kooij,
p24
aVwhere a robot deposits a toothpaste-like slur
p25
aVof recycled refrigerator parts,
p26
aVas if he were a big candy, and makes a chair out of it.
p27
aVOr good design is digital fonts that we use all the time
p28
aVand that become part of our identity.
p29
aVI want people to understand
p30
aVthat design is so much more than cute chairs,
p31
aVthat it is first and foremost everything that is around us
p32
aVin our life.
p33
aa(lp34
VAnd it's interesting how so much of what we're talking about
p35
aVtonight is not simply design but interaction design.
p36
aVAnd in fact, interaction design is what I've been trying
p37
aVto insert in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art
p38
aVfor a few years, starting not very timidly
p39
aVbut just pointedly with works, for instance,
p40
aVby Martin Wattenberg \u2014 the way a machine
p41
aVplays chess with itself, that you see here,
p42
aVor Lisa Strausfeld and her partners, the Sugar interface
p43
aVfor One Laptop Per Child,
p44
aVToshio Iwai's Tenori-On musical instruments,
p45
aVand Philip Worthington's Shadow Monsters,
p46
aVand John Maeda's Reactive Books,
p47
aVand also Jonathan Harris and Sep Kamvar's I Want You To Want Me.
p48
aVThese were some of the first acquisitions that really
p49
aVintroduced the idea of interaction design to the public.
p50
aa(lp51
VBut more recently, I've been trying really to go even deeper
p52
aVinto interaction design with examples
p53
aVthat are emotionally really suggestive
p54
aVand that really explain interaction design at a level
p55
aVthat is almost undeniable.
p56
aVThe Wind Map, by Wattenberg and Fernanda Viégas,
p57
aVI don't know if you've ever seen it \u2014 it's really fantastic.
p58
aVIt looks at the territory of the United States
p59
aVas if it were a wheat field that is procured by the winds
p60
aVand that is really giving you a pictorial image
p61
aVof what's going on with the winds in the United States.
p62
aa(lp63
VBut also, more recently, we started acquiring video games,
p64
aVand that's where all hell broke loose
p65
aVin a really interesting way. (Laughter)
p66
aVThere are still people that believe that there's a high and there's a low.
p67
aVAnd that's really what I find so intriguing
p68
aVabout the reactions that we've had to the anointment
p69
aVof video games in the MoMA collection.
p70
aVWe've \u2014 No, first of all, New York Magazine always gets it.
p71
aVI love them. So we are in the right quadrant.
p72
aVWe are in the Highbrow \u2014 that's daring, that's courageous \u2014
p73
aVand Brilliant, which is great.
p74
aVTimidly, we've been higher on the diagonal in other situations,
p75
aVbut it's okay. It's good. It's good. It's good. (Laughter)
p76
aa(lp77
VBut here comes the art critic. Oh, that was fantastic.
p78
aa(lp79
VSo the first was Jonathan Jones from The Guardian.
p80
aV"Sorry, MoMA, video games are not art."
p81
aVDid I ever say they were art? I was talking about interaction design. Excuse me.
p82
aV"Exhibiting Pac-Man and Tetris alongside Picasso and Van Gogh" \u2014
p83
aVThey're two floors away. (Laughter) \u2014
p84
aV"will mean game over for any real understanding of art."
p85
aVI'm bringing in the end of the world. You know?
p86
aVWe were talking about the rapture? It's coming.
p87
aVAnd Jonathan Jones is making it happen.
p88
aa(lp89
VSo the same Guardian rebuts,
p90
aV"Are video games art: the debate that shouldn't be.
p91
aVLast week, Guardian art critic blah blah suggested
p92
aVthat games cannot qualify as art. But is he right?
p93
aVAnd does it matter?" Thank you. Does it matter?
p94
aa(lp95
VYou know, it's like once again there's this whole problem
p96
aVof design being often misunderstood for art,
p97
aVor the idea that is so diffuse that designers want to
p98
aVaspire to, would like to be called, artists.
p99
aVNo. Designers aspire to be really great designers.
p100
aVThank you very much. And that's more than enough.
p101
aa(lp102
VSo my knight in shining armor, John Maeda,
p103
aVwithout any prompt, came out with this big declaration
p104
aVon why video games belong in the MoMA.
p105
aVAnd that was fantastic. And I thought that was it.
p106
aa(lp107
VBut then there was another wonderfully pretentious article
p108
aVthat came out in The New Republic, so pretentious,
p109
aVby Liel Leibovitz, and it said, "MoMA has mistaken video games for art." Again.
p110
aV"The museum is putting Pac-Man alongside Picasso." Again.
p111
aV"That misses the point."
p112
aVExcuse me. You're missing the point.
p113
aVAnd here, look, the above question is put bluntly:
p114
aV"Are video games art? No. Video games aren't art
p115
aVbecause they are quite thoroughly something else: code."
p116
aVOh, so Picasso is not art because it's oil paint. Right?
p117
aa(lp118
VSo it's so fantastic to see
p119
aVhow these feathers that were ruffled,
p120
aVand these reactions, were so vehement.
p121
aVAnd you know what?
p122
aVThe International Cat Video Film Festival
p123
aVdidn't have that much of a reaction. (Laughter)
p124
aVI think this was truly fantastic.
p125
aVWe were talking about dancing ponies, but I was really jealous
p126
aVof the Walker Arts Center for putting up this festival,
p127
aVbecause it's very, very wonderful.
p128
aVAnd there's this Flaubert quote that I love:
p129
aV"I have always tried to live in an ivory tower,
p130
aVbut a tide of shit is beating at its walls,
p131
aVthreatening to undermine it."
p132
aVI consider myself the tide of shit.
p133
aa(lp134
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p135
aa(lp136
VYou know, we have to go through that.
p137
aVEven in the 1930s, my colleagues
p138
aVthat were trying to put together an abstract art show
p139
aVhad all of these works stopped by the customs officers
p140
aVthat decided they were not art.
p141
aVSo it's happened before, and it will happen in the future,
p142
aVbut right now I can tell you that I am so, so proud
p143
aVto be able to call Pac-Man part of the MoMA collection.
p144
aVAnd the same with, for instance, Tetris, original version, the Soviet one.
p145
aVAnd you know, the amount of work \u2014
p146
aVyeah, Alexey Pajitnov was working for the Soviet government
p147
aVand that's how he developed Tetris,
p148
aVand Alexey himself reconstructed the whole game
p149
aVand even gave us a simulation of the cathode ray tube
p150
aVthat makes it look slightly bombed.
p151
aVAnd it's fantastic.
p152
aa(lp153
VSo behind these acquisitions is an enormous amount of work,
p154
aVbecause we're still the Museum of Modern Art,
p155
aVso even when we tackle popular culture,
p156
aVwe tackle it as a form of interaction design
p157
aVand as something that has to go into the collection at MoMA,
p158
aVtherefore, has to be researched.
p159
aVSo to get to choosing Eric Chahi's
p160
aVwonderful Another World, amongst others,
p161
aVwe put together a panel of experts,
p162
aVand we worked on this acquisition,
p163
aVand it's mostly myself and Kate Carmody and Paul Galloway.
p164
aVWe worked on it for a year and a half.
p165
aVSo many people helped us \u2014 designers of games,
p166
aVyou might know Jamin Warren
p167
aVand his collaborators at Kill Screen magazine,
p168
aVand you know, Kevin Slavin. You name it.
p169
aVWe bugged everybody, because we knew that we were ignorant.
p170
aVWe were not real gamers enough,
p171
aVso we had to really talk to them.
p172
aVAnd so we decided, of course, to have Sim City 2000,
p173
aVnot the other Sim City, that one in particular,
p174
aVso the criteria that we developed along the way
p175
aVwere really strong, and were not only criteria of selection.
p176
aVThey were also criteria of exhibition and of preservation.
p177
aVThat's what makes this acquisition more than a little game
p178
aVor a little joke. It's truly a way to think of how to preserve
p179
aVand show artifacts that will more and more
p180
aVbecome part of our lives in the future.
p181
aVWe live today, as you know very well, not in the digital,
p182
aVnot in the physical, but in the kind of minestrone
p183
aVthat our mind makes of the two.
p184
aa(lp185
VAnd that's really where interaction lies,
p186
aVand that's the importance of interaction.
p187
aVAnd in order to explain interaction, we need to really
p188
aVbring people in and make them realize
p189
aVhow interaction is part of their lives.
p190
aVSo when I talk about it, I don't talk only about video games,
p191
aVwhich are in a way the purest form of interaction,
p192
aVunadulterated by any kind of function or finality.
p193
aVI also talk about the MetroCard vending machine,
p194
aVwhich I consider a masterpiece of interaction.
p195
aVI mean, that interface is beautiful.
p196
aVIt looks like a burly MTA guy coming out of the tunnel.
p197
aVYou know, with your mitt you can actually paw
p198
aVthe MetroCard, and I talk about how bad
p199
aVATM machines usually are.
p200
aVSo I let people understand that it's up to them
p201
aVto know how to judge interaction
p202
aVso as to know when it's good or when it's bad.
p203
aVSo when I show The Sims,
p204
aVI try to make people really feel what it meant
p205
aVto have an interaction with The Sims,
p206
aVnot only the fun but also the responsibility
p207
aVthat came with the Tamagotchi.
p208
aa(lp209
VYou know, video games can be truly deep
p210
aVeven when they're completely mindless.
p211
aVI'm sure that all of you know Katamari Damacy.
p212
aVIt's about rolling a ball and picking up as many objects as you can
p213
aVin a finite amount of time
p214
aVand hopefully you'll be able to make it into a planet.
p215
aVI've never made it into a planet, but that's it.
p216
aVOr, you know, Vib-Ribbon was not distributed here in the United States.
p217
aVIt was a PlayStation game, but mostly for Japan.
p218
aVAnd it was one of the first video games
p219
aVin which you could choose your own music.
p220
aVSo you would put into the PlayStation,
p221
aVyou would put your own CD,
p222
aVand then the game would change alongside your music. So really fantastic.
p223
aa(lp224
VNot to mention Eve Online.
p225
aVEve Online is an artificial universe, if you wish,
p226
aVbut one of the diplomats that was killed in Benghazi,
p227
aVnot Ambassador Stevens, but one of his collaborators,
p228
aVwas a really big shot in Eve Online,
p229
aVso here you have a diplomat in the real world
p230
aVthat spends his time in Eve Online
p231
aVto kind of test, maybe, all of his ideas about diplomacy
p232
aVand about universe-building, and to the point that
p233
aVthe first announcement of the bombing
p234
aVwas actually given on Eve Online,
p235
aVand after his death, several parts of the universe
p236
aVwere named after him.
p237
aVAnd I was just recently at the Eve Online fan festival
p238
aVin Reykjavík that was quite amazing.
p239
aVI mean, we're talking about an experience
p240
aVthat of course can seem weird to many,
p241
aVbut that is very educational.
p242
aVOf course, there are games that are even more educational.
p243
aa(lp244
VDwarf Fortress is like the holy grail
p245
aVof this kind of massive multiplayer online game,
p246
aVand in fact the two Adams brothers were in Reykjavík,
p247
aVand they were greeted
p248
aVby a standing ovation by all the Eve Online fans.
p249
aVIt was amazing to see. And it's a beautiful game.
p250
aVSo you start seeing here that
p251
aVthe aesthetics that are so important
p252
aVto a museum collection like MoMA's
p253
aVare kept alive also by the selection of these games.
p254
aa(lp255
VAnd you know, Valve \u2014 you know, Portal \u2014
p256
aVis an example of a video game in which
p257
aVyou have a certain type of violence
p258
aVwhich also leads me to talk about
p259
aVone of the biggest issues that we had to discuss
p260
aVwhen we acquired the video games, what to do with violence.
p261
aVRight? We had to make decisions.
p262
aVAt MoMA, interestingly, there's a lot of violence
p263
aVdepicted in the art part of the collection,
p264
aVbut when I came to MoMA 19 years ago, and as an Italian,
p265
aVI said, "You know what, we need a Beretta."
p266
aVAnd I was told, "No. No guns in the design collection."
p267
aVAnd I was like, "Why?"
p268
aVInterestingly, I learned that it's considered
p269
aVthat in design and in the design collection,
p270
aVwhat you see is what you get.
p271
aVSo when you see a gun, it's an instrument for killing in the design collection.
p272
aVIf it's in the art collection,
p273
aVit might be a critique of the killing instrument.
p274
aVSo it's very interesting.
p275
aVBut we are acquiring our critical dimension also in design,
p276
aVso maybe one day we'll be able to acquire also the guns.
p277
aVBut here, in this particular case, we decided,
p278
aVyou know, with Kate and Paul,
p279
aVthat we would have no gratuitous violence.
p280
aVSo we have Portal because you shoot walls
p281
aVin order to create new spaces.
p282
aVWe have Street Fighter II, because martial arts are good.
p283
aV(Laughter)
p284
aVBut we don't have GTA because,
p285
aVmaybe it's my own reflection,
p286
aVI've never been able to do anything but crashing cars
p287
aVand shooting prostitutes and pimps.
p288
aVSo it was not very constructive. (Laughter)
p289
aVSo, I'm making fun of it, but we discussed this
p290
aVfor so many days. You have no idea.
p291
aVAnd to this day, I am ambivalent,
p292
aVbut when you have instead games like Flow, there's no doubt.
p293
aVIt's like, it's about serenity and it's about sublime.
p294
aVIt's about experiencing what it means to be a sea creature.
p295
aVThen we have a few also side-scrollers \u2014 classical ones.
p296
aVSo it's quite a hefty collection.
p297
aa(lp298
VAnd right now, we started with the first 14,
p299
aVbut we have several that are coming up,
p300
aVand the reason why we haven't acquired them yet
p301
aVis because you don't acquire just the game.
p302
aVYou acquire the relationship with the company.
p303
aVWhat we want, what we aspire to, is the code.
p304
aVIt's very hard to get, of course.
p305
aVBut that's what would enable us to preserve
p306
aVthe video games for a really long time,
p307
aVand that's what museums do.
p308
aVThey also preserve artifacts for posterity.
p309
aVIn absence of the code, because, you know,
p310
aVvideo game companies are not very forthcoming in some cases,
p311
aVin absence of that, we acquire the relationship with the company.
p312
aVWe're going to stay with them forever.
p313
aVThey're not going to get rid of us.
p314
aVAnd one day, we'll get that code. (Laughter)
p315
aa(lp316
VBut I want to explain to you the criteria that we chose
p317
aVfor interaction design. Aesthetics are really important.
p318
aVAnd I'm showing you Core War here,
p319
aVwhich is an early game that takes advantage aesthetically
p320
aVof the limitations of the processor.
p321
aVSo the kind of interferences that you see here
p322
aVthat look like beautiful barriers in the game
p323
aVare actually a consequence of the processor's limitedness,
p324
aVwhich is fantastic. So aesthetics is always important.
p325
aa(lp326
VAnd so is space, the spatial aspect of games.
p327
aVYou know, I feel that the best video games
p328
aVare the ones that have really savvy architects
p329
aVthat are behind them, and if they're not architects,
p330
aVbona fide trained in architecture, they have that feeling.
p331
aVBut the spatial evolution in video games is extremely important.
p332
aa(lp333
VTime. The way we experience time in video games,
p334
aVas in other forms of interaction design,
p335
aVis really quite amazing.
p336
aVIt can be real time or it can be the time within the game,
p337
aVas is in Animal Crossing, where seasons
p338
aVfollow each other at their own pace.
p339
aa(lp340
VSo time, space, aesthetics,
p341
aVand then, most important, behavior.
p342
aVThe real core issue of interaction design is behavior.
p343
aVDesigners that deal with interaction design behaviors
p344
aVthat go to influence the rest of our lives.
p345
aVThey're not just limited to our interaction with the screen.
p346
aVIn this case, I'm showing you Marble Madness,
p347
aVwhich is a beautiful game
p348
aVin which the controller is a big sphere that vibrates with you,
p349
aVso you have a sphere that's moving in this landscape,
p350
aVand the sphere, the controller itself, gives you a sense of the movement.
p351
aVIn a way, you can see how video games
p352
aVare the purest aspect of interaction design
p353
aVand are very useful to explain what interaction is.
p354
aa(lp355
VWe don't want to show the video games
p356
aVwith the paraphernalia. No arcade nostalgia.
p357
aVIf anything, we want to show the code,
p358
aVand here you see Ben Fry's distellamap of Pac-Man,
p359
aVof the Pac-Man code.
p360
aa(lp361
VSo the way we acquired the games is very interesting
p362
aVand very unorthodox. You see them here
p363
aVdisplayed alongside other examples of design,
p364
aVfurniture and other parts,
p365
aVbut there's no paraphernalia, no nostalagia,
p366
aVonly the screen and a little shelf with the controllers.
p367
aVThe controllers are, of course, part of the experience,
p368
aVso you cannot do away with it.
p369
aVBut interestingly, this choice was not condemned
p370
aVtoo vehemently by gamers.
p371
aVI was afraid that they would kill us,
p372
aVand instead they understood, especially
p373
aVwhen I told them that I was trying to apply the same stratagem
p374
aVthat Philip Johnson applied in 1934
p375
aVwhen he wanted to make people understand
p376
aVthe importance of design, and he took propeller blades
p377
aVand pieces of machinery and
p378
aVin the MoMA galleries he put them on white pedestals
p379
aVagainst white walls, as if they were Brancusi sculptures.
p380
aVHe created this strange distance, this shock,
p381
aVthat made people realize how gorgeous formally,
p382
aVand also important functionally, design pieces were.
p383
aVI would like to do the same with video games.
p384
aVBy getting rid of the sticky carpets and the cigarette butts
p385
aVand everything else that we might remember from our childhood,
p386
aVI want people to understand
p387
aVthat those are important forms of design.
p388
aVAnd in a way, the video games, the fonts and everything else
p389
aVlead us to make people understand
p390
aVa wider meaning for design.
p391
aa(lp392
VOne of my dream acquisitions,
p393
aVwhich has been on hold for a few years
p394
aVbut now will come back on the front burner,
p395
aVis a 747.
p396
aVI would like to acquire it, but without owning it.
p397
aVI don't want it to be at MoMA and possessed by MoMA.
p398
aVI want it to keep flying.
p399
aVSo it's an acquisition where MoMA makes an arrangement
p400
aVwith an airline and keeps the Boeing 747 flying.
p401
aa(lp402
VAnd the same with the "@" sign that we acquired a few years ago.
p403
aVIt was the first example of an acquisition of something
p404
aVthat is in the public domain.
p405
aVAnd what I say to people, it's almost as if
p406
aVa butterfly were flying by
p407
aVand we captured the shadow on the wall,
p408
aVand just we're showing the shadow.
p409
aVSo in a way, we're showing a manifestation
p410
aVof something that is truly important
p411
aVand that is part of our identity but that nobody can have.
p412
aVAnd it's too long to explain the acquisition,
p413
aVbut if you want to go on the MoMA blog,
p414
aVthere's a long post where I explain why
p415
aVit's such a great example of design.
p416
aa(lp417
VAlong the way, I've had to burn a few chairs. You know?
p418
aVI've had to do away with a few concepts of design past.
p419
aVBut I see that people are coming along,
p420
aVthat the audiences, paradoxically,
p421
aVare much more responsive and much more understanding
p422
aVof this expansion of design than some of my colleagues are.
p423
aVDesign is truly everywhere,
p424
aVand design is as important as anything,
p425
aVand I'm so glad that, because of its diversity
p426
aVand because of its centrality to our lives,
p427
aVmany more people are coming to it
p428
aVas a profession, as a passion,
p429
aVand as, very simply, part of their own culture.
p430
aa(lp431
