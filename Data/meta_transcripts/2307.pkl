VSeventy-thousand years ago, our ancestors were insignificant animals.
p4
aVThe most important thing to know about prehistoric humans
p5
aVis that they were unimportant.
p6
aVTheir impact on the world was not much greater than that of jellyfish
p7
aVor fireflies or woodpeckers.
p8
aVToday, in contrast, we control this planet.
p9
aVAnd the question is:
p10
aVHow did we come from there to here?
p11
aVHow did we turn ourselves from insignificant apes,
p12
aVminding their own business in a corner of Africa,
p13
aVinto the rulers of planet Earth?
p14
aa(lp15
VUsually, we look for the difference between us and all the other animals
p16
aVon the individual level.
p17
aVWe want to believe \u2014 I want to believe \u2014
p18
aVthat there is something special about me,
p19
aVabout my body, about my brain,
p20
aVthat makes me so superior to a dog or a pig, or a chimpanzee.
p21
aVBut the truth is that, on the individual level,
p22
aVI'm embarrassingly similar to a chimpanzee.
p23
aVAnd if you take me and a chimpanzee and put us together on some lonely island,
p24
aVand we had to struggle for survival to see who survives better,
p25
aVI would definitely place my bet on the chimpanzee, not on myself.
p26
aVAnd this is not something wrong with me personally.
p27
aVI guess if they took almost any one of you, and placed you alone
p28
aVwith a chimpanzee on some island,
p29
aVthe chimpanzee would do much better.
p30
aa(lp31
VThe real difference between humans and all other animals
p32
aVis not on the individual level;
p33
aVit's on the collective level.
p34
aVHumans control the planet because they are the only animals
p35
aVthat can cooperate both flexibly and in very large numbers.
p36
aVNow, there are other animals \u2014
p37
aVlike the social insects, the bees, the ants \u2014
p38
aVthat can cooperate in large numbers, but they don't do so flexibly.
p39
aVTheir cooperation is very rigid.
p40
aVThere is basically just one way in which a beehive can function.
p41
aVAnd if there's a new opportunity or a new danger,
p42
aVthe bees cannot reinvent the social system overnight.
p43
aVThey cannot, for example, execute the queen
p44
aVand establish a republic of bees,
p45
aVor a communist dictatorship of worker bees.
p46
aa(lp47
VOther animals, like the social mammals \u2014
p48
aVthe wolves, the elephants, the dolphins, the chimpanzees \u2014
p49
aVthey can cooperate much more flexibly,
p50
aVbut they do so only in small numbers,
p51
aVbecause cooperation among chimpanzees
p52
aVis based on intimate knowledge, one of the other.
p53
aVI'm a chimpanzee and you're a chimpanzee,
p54
aVand I want to cooperate with you.
p55
aVI need to know you personally.
p56
aVWhat kind of chimpanzee are you?
p57
aVAre you a nice chimpanzee?
p58
aVAre you an evil chimpanzee?
p59
aVAre you trustworthy?
p60
aVIf I don't know you, how can I cooperate with you?
p61
aa(lp62
VThe only animal that can combine the two abilities together
p63
aVand cooperate both flexibly and still do so in very large numbers
p64
aVis us, Homo sapiens.
p65
aVOne versus one, or even 10 versus 10,
p66
aVchimpanzees might be better than us.
p67
aVBut, if you pit 1,000 humans against 1,000 chimpanzees,
p68
aVthe humans will win easily, for the simple reason
p69
aVthat a thousand chimpanzees cannot cooperate at all.
p70
aVAnd if you now try to cram 100,000 chimpanzees
p71
aVinto Oxford Street, or into Wembley Stadium,
p72
aVor Tienanmen Square or the Vatican,
p73
aVyou will get chaos, complete chaos.
p74
aVJust imagine Wembley Stadium with 100,000 chimpanzees.
p75
aVComplete madness.
p76
aa(lp77
VIn contrast, humans normally gather there in tens of thousands,
p78
aVand what we get is not chaos, usually.
p79
aVWhat we get is extremely sophisticated and effective networks of cooperation.
p80
aVAll the huge achievements of humankind throughout history,
p81
aVwhether it's building the pyramids or flying to the moon,
p82
aVhave been based not on individual abilities,
p83
aVbut on this ability to cooperate flexibly in large numbers.
p84
aa(lp85
VThink even about this very talk that I'm giving now:
p86
aVI'm standing here in front of an audience of about 300 or 400 people,
p87
aVmost of you are complete strangers to me.
p88
aVSimilarly, I don't really know all the people who have organized
p89
aVand worked on this event.
p90
aVI don't know the pilot and the crew members of the plane
p91
aVthat brought me over here, yesterday, to London.
p92
aVI don't know the people who invented and manufactured
p93
aVthis microphone and these cameras, which are recording what I'm saying.
p94
aVI don't know the people who wrote all the books and articles
p95
aVthat I read in preparation for this talk.
p96
aVAnd I certainly don't know all the people
p97
aVwho might be watching this talk over the Internet,
p98
aVsomewhere in Buenos Aires or in New Delhi.
p99
aa(lp100
VNevertheless, even though we don't know each other,
p101
aVwe can work together to create this global exchange of ideas.
p102
aVThis is something chimpanzees cannot do.
p103
aVThey communicate, of course,
p104
aVbut you will never catch a chimpanzee traveling to some distant chimpanzee band
p105
aVto give them a talk about bananas or about elephants,
p106
aVor anything else that might interest chimpanzees.
p107
aVNow cooperation is, of course, not always nice;
p108
aVall the horrible things humans have been doing throughout history \u2014
p109
aVand we have been doing some very horrible things \u2014
p110
aVall those things are also based on large-scale cooperation.
p111
aVPrisons are a system of cooperation;
p112
aVslaughterhouses are a system of cooperation;
p113
aVconcentration camps are a system of cooperation.
p114
aVChimpanzees don't have slaughterhouses and prisons and concentration camps.
p115
aa(lp116
VNow suppose I've managed to convince you perhaps that yes,
p117
aVwe control the world because we can cooperate flexibly in large numbers.
p118
aVThe next question that immediately arises
p119
aVin the mind of an inquisitive listener is:
p120
aVHow, exactly, do we do it?
p121
aVWhat enables us alone, of all the animals, to cooperate in such a way?
p122
aVThe answer is our imagination.
p123
aVWe can cooperate flexibly with countless numbers of strangers,
p124
aVbecause we alone, of all the animals on the planet,
p125
aVcan create and believe fictions, fictional stories.
p126
aVAnd as long as everybody believes in the same fiction,
p127
aVeverybody obeys and follows the same rules,
p128
aVthe same norms, the same values.
p129
aa(lp130
VAll other animals use their communication system
p131
aVonly to describe reality.
p132
aVA chimpanzee may say, "Look! There's a lion, let's run away!"
p133
aVOr, "Look! There's a banana tree over there! Let's go and get bananas!"
p134
aVHumans, in contrast, use their language not merely to describe reality,
p135
aVbut also to create new realities, fictional realities.
p136
aVA human can say, "Look, there is a god above the clouds!
p137
aVAnd if you don't do what I tell you to do,
p138
aVwhen you die, God will punish you and send you to hell."
p139
aVAnd if you all believe this story that I've invented,
p140
aVthen you will follow the same norms and laws and values,
p141
aVand you can cooperate.
p142
aVThis is something only humans can do.
p143
aVYou can never convince a chimpanzee to give you a banana
p144
aVby promising him, "... after you die, you'll go to chimpanzee heaven ..."
p145
aV(Laughter)
p146
aV"... and you'll receive lots and lots of bananas for your good deeds.
p147
aVSo now give me this banana."
p148
aVNo chimpanzee will ever believe such a story.
p149
aVOnly humans believe such stories,
p150
aVwhich is why we control the world,
p151
aVwhereas the chimpanzees are locked up in zoos and research laboratories.
p152
aa(lp153
VNow you may find it acceptable that yes,
p154
aVin the religious field, humans cooperate by believing in the same fictions.
p155
aVMillions of people come together to build a cathedral or a mosque
p156
aVor fight in a crusade or a jihad, because they all believe in the same stories
p157
aVabout God and heaven and hell.
p158
aVBut what I want to emphasize is that exactly the same mechanism
p159
aVunderlies all other forms of mass-scale human cooperation,
p160
aVnot only in the religious field.
p161
aa(lp162
VTake, for example, the legal field.
p163
aVMost legal systems today in the world are based on a belief in human rights.
p164
aVBut what are human rights?
p165
aVHuman rights, just like God and heaven, are just a story that we've invented.
p166
aVThey are not an objective reality;
p167
aVthey are not some biological effect about homo sapiens.
p168
aVTake a human being, cut him open, look inside,
p169
aVyou will find the heart, the kidneys, neurons, hormones, DNA,
p170
aVbut you won't find any rights.
p171
aVThe only place you find rights are in the stories
p172
aVthat we have invented and spread around over the last few centuries.
p173
aVThey may be very positive stories, very good stories,
p174
aVbut they're still just fictional stories that we've invented.
p175
aa(lp176
VThe same is true of the political field.
p177
aVThe most important factors in modern politics are states and nations.
p178
aVBut what are states and nations?
p179
aVThey are not an objective reality.
p180
aVA mountain is an objective reality.
p181
aVYou can see it, you can touch it, you can even smell it.
p182
aVBut a nation or a state,
p183
aVlike Israel or Iran or France or Germany,
p184
aVthis is just a story that we've invented
p185
aVand became extremely attached to.
p186
aa(lp187
VThe same is true of the economic field.
p188
aVThe most important actors today in the global economy
p189
aVare companies and corporations.
p190
aVMany of you today, perhaps, work for a corporation,
p191
aVlike Google or Toyota or McDonald's.
p192
aVWhat exactly are these things?
p193
aVThey are what lawyers call legal fictions.
p194
aVThey are stories invented and maintained
p195
aVby the powerful wizards we call lawyers.
p196
aV(Laughter)
p197
aVAnd what do corporations do all day?
p198
aVMostly, they try to make money.
p199
aVYet, what is money?
p200
aVAgain, money is not an objective reality; it has no objective value.
p201
aVTake this green piece of paper, the dollar bill.
p202
aVLook at it \u2014 it has no value.
p203
aVYou cannot eat it, you cannot drink it,
p204
aVyou cannot wear it.
p205
aVBut then came along these master storytellers \u2014
p206
aVthe big bankers,
p207
aVthe finance ministers,
p208
aVthe prime ministers \u2014
p209
aVand they tell us a very convincing story:
p210
aV"Look, you see this green piece of paper?
p211
aVIt is actually worth 10 bananas."
p212
aVAnd if I believe it, and you believe it,
p213
aVand everybody believes it,
p214
aVit actually works.
p215
aVI can take this worthless piece of paper,
p216
aVgo to the supermarket,
p217
aVgive it to a complete stranger whom I've never met before,
p218
aVand get, in exchange, real bananas which I can actually eat.
p219
aVThis is something amazing.
p220
aVYou could never do it with chimpanzees.
p221
aVChimpanzees trade, of course:
p222
aV"Yes, you give me a coconut, I'll give you a banana."
p223
aVThat can work.
p224
aVBut, you give me a worthless piece of paper
p225
aVand you except me to give you a banana?
p226
aVNo way!
p227
aVWhat do you think I am, a human?
p228
aV(Laughter)
p229
aa(lp230
VMoney, in fact, is the most successful story
p231
aVever invented and told by humans,
p232
aVbecause it is the only story everybody believes.
p233
aVNot everybody believes in God,
p234
aVnot everybody believes in human rights,
p235
aVnot everybody believes in nationalism,
p236
aVbut everybody believes in money, and in the dollar bill.
p237
aVTake, even, Osama Bin Laden.
p238
aVHe hated American politics and American religion
p239
aVand American culture,
p240
aVbut he had no objection to American dollars.
p241
aVHe was quite fond of them, actually.
p242
aV(Laughter)
p243
aa(lp244
VTo conclude, then:
p245
aVWe humans control the world because we live in a dual reality.
p246
aVAll other animals live in an objective reality.
p247
aVTheir reality consists of objective entities,
p248
aVlike rivers and trees and lions and elephants.
p249
aVWe humans, we also live in an objective reality.
p250
aVIn our world, too, there are rivers and trees and lions and elephants.
p251
aVBut over the centuries,
p252
aVwe have constructed on top of this objective reality
p253
aVa second layer of fictional reality,
p254
aVa reality made of fictional entities,
p255
aVlike nations, like gods, like money, like corporations.
p256
aVAnd what is amazing is that as history unfolded,
p257
aVthis fictional reality became more and more powerful
p258
aVso that today, the most powerful forces in the world
p259
aVare these fictional entities.
p260
aVToday, the very survival of rivers and trees and lions and elephants
p261
aVdepends on the decisions and wishes of fictional entities,
p262
aVlike the United States, like Google, like the World Bank \u2014
p263
aVentities that exist only in our own imagination.
p264
aa(lp265
VThank you.
p266
aV(Applause)
p267
aa(lp268
VBruno Giussani: Yuval, you have a new book out.
p269
aVAfter Sapiens, you wrote another one,
p270
aVand it's out in Hebrew, but not yet translated into ...
p271
aa(lp272
VYuval Noah Harari: I'm working on the translation as we speak.
p273
aa(lp274
VBG: In the book, if I understand it correctly,
p275
aVyou argue that the amazing breakthroughs that we are experiencing right now
p276
aVnot only will potentially make our lives better,
p277
aVbut they will create \u2014 and I quote you \u2014
p278
aV"... new classes and new class struggles, just as the industrial revolution did."
p279
aVCan you elaborate for us?
p280
aa(lp281
VYNH: Yes. In the industrial revolution,
p282
aVwe saw the creation of a new class of the urban proletariat.
p283
aVAnd much of the political and social history of the last 200 years involved
p284
aVwhat to do with this class, and the new problems and opportunities.
p285
aVNow, we see the creation of a new massive class of useless people.
p286
aV(Laughter)
p287
aVAs computers become better and better in more and more fields,
p288
aVthere is a distinct possibility that computers will out-perform us
p289
aVin most tasks and will make humans redundant.
p290
aVAnd then the big political and economic question
p291
aVof the 21st century will be,
p292
aV"What do we need humans for?",
p293
aVor at least, "What do we need so many humans for?"
p294
aa(lp295
VBG: Do you have an answer in the book?
p296
aa(lp297
VYNH: At present, the best guess we have is to keep them happy
p298
aVwith drugs and computer games ...
p299
aV(Laughter)
p300
aVbut this doesn't sound like a very appealing future.
p301
aa(lp302
VBG: Ok, so you're basically saying in the book and now,
p303
aVthat for all the discussion about the growing evidence
p304
aVof significant economic inequality, we are just kind of at the beginning
p305
aVof the process?
p306
aa(lp307
VYNH: Again, it's not a prophecy;
p308
aVit's seeing all kinds of possibilities before us.
p309
aVOne possibility is this creation of a new massive class of useless people.
p310
aVAnother possibility is the division of humankind
p311
aVinto different biological castes,
p312
aVwith the rich being upgraded into virtual gods,
p313
aVand the poor being degraded to this level of useless people.
p314
aa(lp315
VBG: I feel there is another TED talk coming up in a year or two.
p316
aVThank you, Yuval, for making the trip.
p317
aa(lp318
VYNH: Thanks!
