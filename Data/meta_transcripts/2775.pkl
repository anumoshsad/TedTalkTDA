VGetting a college education
p4
aVis a 20-year investment.
p5
aVWhen you're growing up poor,
p6
aVyou're not accustomed to thinking that far ahead.
p7
aVInstead, you're thinking about where you're going to get your next meal
p8
aVand how your family is going to pay rent that month.
p9
aVBesides, my parents and my friends' parents
p10
aVseemed to be doing just fine driving taxis and working as janitors.
p11
aVIt wasn't until I was a teenager
p12
aVwhen I realized I didn't want to do those things.
p13
aVBy then, I was two-thirds of the way through my education,
p14
aVand it was almost too late to turn things around.
p15
aa(lp16
VWhen you grow up poor, you want to be rich.
p17
aVI was no different.
p18
aVI'm the second-oldest of seven,
p19
aVand was raised by a single mother on government aid
p20
aVin Queens, New York.
p21
aVBy virtue of growing up low-income,
p22
aVmy siblings and I went to some of New York City's
p23
aVmost struggling public schools.
p24
aVI had over 60 absences when I was in seventh grade,
p25
aVbecause I didn't feel like going to class.
p26
aVMy high school had a 55 percent graduation rate,
p27
aVand even worse,
p28
aVonly 20 percent of the kids graduating
p29
aVwere college-ready.
p30
aa(lp31
VWhen I actually did make it to college,
p32
aVI told my friend Brennan
p33
aVhow our teachers would always ask us to raise our hands
p34
aVif we were going to college.
p35
aVI was taken aback when Brennan said,
p36
aV"Karim, I've never been asked that question before."
p37
aVIt was always, "What college are you going to?"
p38
aVJust the way that question is phrased
p39
aVmade it unacceptable for him not to have gone to college.
p40
aa(lp41
VNowadays I get asked a different question.
p42
aV"How were you able to make it out?"
p43
aVFor years I said I was lucky,
p44
aVbut it's not just luck.
p45
aVWhen my older brother and I graduated from high school
p46
aVat the very same time
p47
aVand he later dropped out of a two-year college,
p48
aVI wanted to understand why he dropped out
p49
aVand I kept studying.
p50
aVIt wasn't until I got to Cornell as a Presidential Research Scholar
p51
aVthat I started to learn about the very real educational consequences
p52
aVof being raised by a single mother on government aid
p53
aVand attending the schools that I did.
p54
aVThat's when my older brother's trajectory began to make complete sense to me.
p55
aa(lp56
VI also learned that our most admirable education reformers,
p57
aVpeople like Arne Duncan, the former US Secretary of Education,
p58
aVor Wendy Kopp, the founder of Teach For America,
p59
aVhad never attended an inner city public school like I had.
p60
aVSo much of our education reform is driven by a sympathetic approach,
p61
aVwhere people are saying,
p62
aV"Let's go and help these poor inner city kids,
p63
aVor these poor black and Latino kids,"
p64
aVinstead of an empathetic approach,
p65
aVwhere someone like me, who had grown up in this environment, could say,
p66
aV"I know the adversities that you're facing
p67
aVand I want to help you overcome them."
p68
aa(lp69
VToday when I get questions about how I made it out,
p70
aVI share that one of the biggest reasons
p71
aVis that I wasn't ashamed to ask for help.
p72
aVIn a typical middle class or affluent household,
p73
aVif a kid is struggling,
p74
aVthere's a good chance that a parent or a teacher will come to their rescue
p75
aVeven if they don't ask for help.
p76
aVHowever, if that same kid is growing up poor
p77
aVand doesn't ask for help,
p78
aVthere's a good chance that no one will help them.
p79
aVThere are virtually no social safety nets available.
p80
aa(lp81
VSo seven years ago,
p82
aVI started to reform our public education system
p83
aVshaped by my firsthand perspective.
p84
aVAnd I started with summer school.
p85
aVResearch tells us that two-thirds of the achievement gap,
p86
aVwhich is the disparity in educational attainment
p87
aVbetween rich kids and poor kids
p88
aVor black kids and white kids,
p89
aVcould be directly attributed to the summer learning loss.
p90
aVIn low-income neighborhoods, kids forget almost three months
p91
aVof what they learned during the school year
p92
aVover the summer.
p93
aVThey return to school in the fall,
p94
aVand their teachers spend another two months
p95
aVreteaching them old material.
p96
aVThat's five months.
p97
aVThe school year in the United States is only 10 months.
p98
aVIf kids lose five months of learning every single year,
p99
aVthat's half of their education.
p100
aVHalf.
p101
aa(lp102
VIf kids were in school over the summer, then they couldn't regress,
p103
aVbut traditional summer school is poorly designed.
p104
aVFor kids it feels like punishment,
p105
aVand for teachers it feels like babysitting.
p106
aVBut how can we expect principals to execute an effective summer program
p107
aVwhen the school year ends the last week of June
p108
aVand then summer school starts just one week later?
p109
aVThere just isn't enough time to find the right people,
p110
aVsort out the logistics,
p111
aVand design an engaging curriculum that excites kids and teachers.
p112
aa(lp113
VBut what if we created a program over the summer
p114
aVthat empowered teachers as teaching coaches
p115
aVto develop aspiring educators?
p116
aVWhat if we empowered college-educated role models
p117
aVas teaching fellows
p118
aVto help kids realize their college ambitions?
p119
aVWhat if empowered high-achieving kids
p120
aVas mentors to tutor their younger peers
p121
aVand inspire them to invest in their education?
p122
aVWhat if we empowered all kids as scholars,
p123
aVasked them what colleges they were going to,
p124
aVdesigned a summer school they want to attend
p125
aVto completely eliminate the summer learning loss
p126
aVand close two-thirds of the achievement gap?
p127
aa(lp128
VBy this summer, my team will have served over 4,000 low-income children,
p129
aVtrained over 300 aspiring teachers
p130
aVand created more than 1,000 seasonal jobs
p131
aVacross some of New York City's most disadvantaged neighborhoods.
p132
aa(lp133
V(Applause)
p134
aa(lp135
VAnd our kids are succeeding.
p136
aVTwo years of independent evaluations
p137
aVtell us that our kids eliminate the summer learning loss
p138
aVand make growth of one month in math
p139
aVand two months in reading.
p140
aVSo instead of returning to school in the fall three months behind,
p141
aVthey now go back four months ahead in math
p142
aVand five months ahead in reading.
p143

p145
aa(lp146
VTen years ago, if you would have told me
p147
aVthat I'd graduate in the top 10 percent of my class from an Ivy League institution
p148
aVand have an opportunity to make a dent on our public education system
p149
aVjust by tackling two months of the calendar year,
p150
aVI would have said,
p151
aV"Nah. No way."
p152
aVWhat's even more exciting
p153
aVis that if we can prevent five months of lost time
p154
aVjust by redesigning two months,
p155
aVimagine the possibilities that we can unlock
p156
aVby tackling the rest of the calendar year.
p157
aa(lp158
