VI've always had a fascination for computers and technology,
p4
aVand I made a few apps for the iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad.
p5
aVI'd like to share a couple with you today.
p6
aVMy first app was a unique fortune teller called "Earth Fortune"
p7
aVthat would display different colors of Earth
p8
aVdepending on what your fortune was.
p9
aVMy favorite and most successful app
p10
aVis "Bustin Jieber," which is \u2014
p11
aa(lp12
V(Laughter)
p13
aa(lp14
Vwhich is a Justin Bieber whack-a-mole.
p15
aa(lp16
V(Laughter)
p17
aa(lp18
VI created it because a lot of people at school
p19
aVdisliked Justin Bieber a little bit,
p20
aVso I decided to make the app.
p21
aVSo I went to work programming it,
p22
aVand I released it just before the holidays in 2010.
p23
aVA lot of people ask me, how did I make these?
p24
aVA lot of times it's because the person who asked the question
p25
aVwants to make an app also.
p26
aVA lot of kids these days like to play games,
p27
aVbut now they want to make them, and it's difficult,
p28
aVbecause not many kids know where to go to find out how to make a program.
p29
aVI mean, for soccer, you could go to a soccer team.
p30
aVFor violin, you could get lessons for a violin.
p31
aVBut what if you want to make an app?
p32
aVAnd the kid's parents might have done some of these things when they were young,
p33
aVbut not many parents have written apps.
p34
aa(lp35
V(Laughter)
p36
aa(lp37
VWhere do you go to find out how to make an app?
p38
aVWell, this is how I approached it, this is what I did.
p39
aVFirst of all, I've been programming in multiple other programming languages
p40
aVto get the basics down,
p41
aVsuch as Python, C, Java, etc.
p42
aVAnd then Apple released the iPhone,
p43
aVand with it, the iPhone software development kit,
p44
aVand the software development kit is a suite of tools
p45
aVfor creating and programming an iPhone app.
p46
aVThis opened up a whole new world of possibilities for me,
p47
aVand after playing with the software development kit a little bit,
p48
aVI made a couple of apps, I made some test apps.
p49
aVOne of them happened to be "Earth Fortune,"
p50
aVand I was ready to put "Earth Fortune" on the App Store,
p51
aVand so I persuaded my parents to pay the 99 dollar fee
p52
aVto be able to put my apps on the App Store.
p53
aVThey agreed, and now I have apps on the App Store.
p54
aVI've gotten a lot of interest and encouragement
p55
aVfrom my family, friends, teachers and even people at the Apple Store,
p56
aVand that's been a huge help to me.
p57
aa(lp58
VI've gotten a lot of inspiration from Steve Jobs,
p59
aVand I've started an app club at school,
p60
aVand a teacher at my school is kindly sponsoring my app club.
p61
aVAny student at my school can come and learn how to design an app.
p62
aVThis is so I can share my experiences with others.
p63
aVThere's these programs called the iPad Pilot Program,
p64
aVand some districts have them.
p65
aVI'm fortunate enough to be part of one.
p66
aVA big challenge is, how should the iPads be used,
p67
aVand what apps should we put on the iPads?
p68
aVSo we're getting feedback from teachers at the school
p69
aVto see what kind of apps they'd like.
p70
aVWhen we design the app and we sell it,
p71
aVit will be free to local districts; and other districts that we sell to \u2014
p72
aVall the money from that will go into the local ed foundations.
p73
aa(lp74
VThese days, students usually know a little bit more than teachers
p75
aVwith the technology.
p76
aa(lp77
V(Laughter)
p78
aa(lp79
VSo \u2014
p80
aa(lp81
V(Laughter)
p82
aa(lp83
VSorry.
p84
aa(lp85
V(Laughter)
p86
aa(lp87
VSo this is a resource to teachers,
p88
aVand educators should recognize this resource and make good use of it.
p89
aa(lp90
V(Laughter)
p91
aa(lp92
VI'd like to finish up by saying what I'd like to do in the future.
p93
aVFirst of all, I'd like to create more apps, more games.
p94
aVI'm working with a third party company to make an app.
p95
aVI'd like to get into Android programming and development,
p96
aVand I'd like to continue my app club,
p97
aVand find other ways for students to share knowledge with others.
p98
aa(lp99
VThank you.
