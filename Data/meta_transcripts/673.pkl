VOne of my favorite cartoon characters is Snoopy.
p4
aVI love the way he sits and lies on his kennel and contemplates the great things of life.
p5
aVSo when I thought about compassion,
p6
aVmy mind immediately went to one of the cartoon strips,
p7
aVwhere he's lying there and he says,
p8
aV"I really understand, and I really appreciate
p9
aVhow one should love one's neighbor as one love's oneself.
p10
aVThe only trouble is the people next door; I can't stand them."
p11
aVThis, in a way, is one of the challenges
p12
aVof how to interpret a really good idea.
p13
aa(lp14
VWe all, I think, believe in compassion.
p15
aVIf you look at all the world religions, all the main world religions,
p16
aVyou'll find within them some teaching concerning compassion.
p17
aVSo in Judaism, we have, from our Torah,
p18
aVthat you should love your neighbor as you love yourself.
p19
aVAnd within Jewish teachings, the rabbinic teachings, we have Hillel,
p20
aVwho taught that you shouldn't do to others what you don't like being done to yourself.
p21
aVAnd all the main religions have similar teachings.
p22
aVAnd again, within Judaism,
p23
aVwe have a teaching about God,
p24
aVwho is called the compassionate one, Ha-rachaman.
p25
aVAfter all, how could the world exist without God being compassionate?
p26
aVAnd we, as taught within the Torah that we are made in the image of God,
p27
aVso we too have to be compassionate.
p28
aVBut what does it mean? How does it impact on our everyday life?
p29
aVSometimes, of course, being compassionate
p30
aVcan produce feelings within us that are very difficult to control.
p31
aa(lp32
VI know there are many times when I've gone and conducted a funeral,
p33
aVor when I have been sitting with the bereaved, or with people who are dying,
p34
aVand I am overwhelmed by the sadness, by the difficulty,
p35
aVthe challenge that is there for the family, for the person.
p36
aVAnd I'm touched, so that tears come to my eyes.
p37
aVAnd yet, if I just allowed myself to be overwhelmed by these feelings,
p38
aVI wouldn't be doing my job \u2014
p39
aVbecause I have to actually be there for them
p40
aVand make sure that rituals happen, that practicalities are seen to.
p41
aVAnd yet, on the other hand, if I didn't feel this compassion,
p42
aVthen I feel that it would be time for me to hang up my robe
p43
aVand give up being a rabbi.
p44
aa(lp45
VAnd these same feelings are there for all of us as we face the world.
p46
aVWho cannot be touched by compassion
p47
aVwhen we see the terrible horrors of the results of war,
p48
aVor famine, or earthquakes, or tsunamis?
p49
aVI know some people who say
p50
aV"Well, you know there's just so much out there \u2014 I can't do anything,
p51
aVI'm not going to even begin to try."
p52
aVAnd there are some charity workers who call this compassion fatigue.
p53
aVThere are others who feel they can't confront compassion anymore,
p54
aVand so they turn off the television and don't watch.
p55
aVIn Judaism, though, we tend to always say, there has to be a middle way.
p56
aa(lp57
VYou have to, of course, be aware of the needs of others,
p58
aVbut you have to be aware in such a way that you can carry on with your life
p59
aVand be of help to people.
p60
aVSo part of compassion has to be an understanding of what makes people tick.
p61
aVAnd, of course, you can't do that unless you understand yourself a bit more.
p62
aa(lp63
VAnd there's a lovely rabbinic interpretation of the beginnings of creation,
p64
aVwhich says that when God created the world,
p65
aVGod thought that it would be best to create the world
p66
aVonly with the divine attribute of justice.
p67
aVBecause, after all, God is just.
p68
aVTherefore, there should be justice throughout the world.
p69
aVAnd then God looked to the future and realized,
p70
aVif the world was created just with justice, the world couldn't exist.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo, God thought, "Nope, I'm going to create the world just with compassion."
p73
aVAnd then God looked to the future and realized that,
p74
aVin fact, if the world were just filled with compassion,
p75
aVthere would be anarchy and chaos.
p76
aVThere had to be limits to all things.
p77
aVThe rabbis describe this as being like a king
p78
aVwho has a beautiful, fragile glass bowl.
p79
aVIf you put too much cold water in, it will shatter.
p80
aVIf you put boiling water in, it will shatter.
p81
aVWhat do you have to do? Put in a mixture of the two.
p82
aVAnd so God put both of these possibilities into the world.
p83
aa(lp84
VThere is something more though that has to be there.
p85
aVAnd that is the translation of the feelings
p86
aVthat we may have about compassion
p87
aVinto the wider world, into action.
p88
aVSo, like Snoopy, we can't just lie there
p89
aVand think great thoughts about our neighbors.
p90
aVWe actually have to do something about it.
p91
aVAnd so there is also, within Judaism, this notion of love and kindness
p92
aVthat becomes very important: "chesed."
p93
aa(lp94
VAll these three things, then, have to be melded together.
p95
aVThe idea of justice, which gives boundaries to our lives
p96
aVand gives us a feeling of what's right about life, what's right about living,
p97
aVwhat should we be doing, social justice.
p98
aVThere has to be a willingness to do good deeds,
p99
aVbut not, of course, at the expense of our own sanity.
p100
aVYou know, there's no way that you can do anything for anyone
p101
aVif you overdo things.
p102
aVAnd balancing them all in the middle is this notion of compassion,
p103
aVwhich has to be there, if you like, at our very roots.
p104
aa(lp105
VThis idea of compassion comes to us
p106
aVbecause we're made in the image of God,
p107
aVwho is ultimately the compassionate one.
p108
aVWhat does this compassion entail?
p109
aVIt entails understanding the pain of the other.
p110
aVBut even more than that,
p111
aVit means understanding one's connection to the whole of creation:
p112
aVunderstanding that one is part of that creation,
p113
aVthat there is a unity that underlies all that we see,
p114
aVall that we hear, all that we feel.
p115
aVI call that unity God.
p116
aVAnd that unity is something that connects all of creation.
p117
aa(lp118
VAnd, of course, in the modern world, with the environmental movement,
p119
aVwe're becoming even more aware of the connectivity of things,
p120
aVthat something I do here actually does matter in Africa,
p121
aVthat if I use too much of my carbon allowance,
p122
aVit seems to be that we are causing
p123
aVa great lack of rain in central and eastern Africa.
p124
aVSo there is a connectivity,
p125
aVand I have to understand that \u2014 as part of the creation,
p126
aVas part of me being made in the image of God.
p127
aVAnd I have to understand that my needs
p128
aVsometimes have to be sublimated to other needs.
p129
aa(lp130
VThis "18 minutes" business, I find quite fascinating.
p131
aVBecause in Judaism, the number 18, in Hebrew letters,
p132
aVstands for life \u2014 the word "life."
p133
aVSo, in a sense, the 18 minutes is challenging me to say,
p134
aV"In life, this is what's important in terms of compassion."
p135
aVBut, something else as well:
p136
aVactually, 18 minutes is important.
p137
aVBecause at Passover, when we have to eat unleavened bread,
p138
aVthe rabbis say, what is the difference between dough that is made into bread,
p139
aVand dough that is made into unleavened bread, or "matzah"?
p140
aVAnd they say "It's 18 minutes."
p141
aVBecause that's how long they say it takes for this dough to become leaven.
p142
aVWhat does it mean, "dough becomes leaven"?
p143
aVIt means it gets filled with hot air.
p144
aVWhat's matzah? What's unleavened bread? You don't get it.
p145
aa(lp146
VSymbolically, what the rabbis say is that at Passover,
p147
aVwhat we have to do is try to get rid of our hot air \u2014 our pride,
p148
aVour feeling that we are the most important people in the whole entire world,
p149
aVand that everything should revolve round us.
p150
aVSo we try and get rid of those,
p151
aVand so doing, try to get rid of the habits, the emotions, the ideas
p152
aVthat enslave us, that make our eyes closed, give us tunnel vision
p153
aVso we don't see the needs of others \u2014
p154
aVand free ourselves and free ourselves from that.
p155
aVAnd that too is a basis for having compassion,
p156
aVfor understanding our place in the world.
p157
aa(lp158
VNow there is, in Judaism, a gorgeous story
p159
aVof a rich man who sat in synagogue one day.
p160
aVAnd, as many people do, he was dozing off during the sermon.
p161
aVAnd as he was dozing off, they were reading from the book of Leviticus in the Torah.
p162
aVAnd they were saying that in the ancient times in the temple in Jerusalem,
p163
aVthe priests used to have bread,
p164
aVwhich they used to place into a special table in the temple in Jerusalem.
p165
aVThe man was asleep, but he heard the words bread, temple, God, and he woke up.
p166
aVHe said, "God wants bread. That's it. God wants bread. I know what God wants."
p167
aa(lp168
VAnd he rushed home. And after the Sabbath, he made 12 loaves of bread,
p169
aVtook them to the synagogue, went into the synagogue,
p170
aVopened the ark and said, "God, I don't know why you want this bread, but here you are."
p171
aVAnd he put it in the ark with the scrolls of the Torah.
p172
aVThen he went home.
p173
aa(lp174
VThe cleaner came into the synagogue.
p175
aV"Oh God, I'm in such trouble. I've got children to feed.
p176
aVMy wife's ill. I've got no money. What can I do?"
p177
aVHe goes into the synagogue. "God, will you please help me?
p178
aVAh, what a wonderful smell."
p179
aVHe goes to the ark. He opens the ark.
p180
aV"There's bread! God, you've answered my plea. You've answered my question."
p181
aVTakes the bread and goes home.
p182
aa(lp183
VMeanwhile, the rich man thinks to himself,
p184
aV"I'm an idiot. God wants bread?
p185
aVGod, the one who rules the entire universe, wants my bread?"
p186
aVHe rushes to the synagogue. "I'll get it out of the ark before anybody finds it."
p187
aVHe goes in there, and it's not there.
p188
aVAnd he says, "God, you really did want it. You wanted my bread.
p189
aVNext week, with raisins."
p190
aa(lp191
VThis went on for years.
p192
aVEvery week, the man would bring bread with raisins,
p193
aVwith all sorts of good things, put it into the ark.
p194
aVEvery week, the cleaner would come. "God you've answered my plea again."
p195
aVTake the bread. Take it home.
p196
aa(lp197
VWent on until a new rabbi came. Rabbis always spoil things.
p198
aVThe rabbi came in and saw what was going on.
p199
aVAnd he called the two of them to his office.
p200
aVAnd he said, you know, "This is what's happening."
p201
aa(lp202
VAnd the rich man \u2014 oh, dear \u2014 crestfallen.
p203
aV"You mean God didn't want my bread?"
p204
aa(lp205
VAnd the poor man said, "And you mean God didn't answer my pleas?"
p206
aa(lp207
VAnd the rabbi said, "You've misunderstood me.
p208
aVYou've misunderstood totally," he said.
p209
aV"Of course, what you are doing," he said to the rich man,
p210
aV"is answering God's plea that we should be compassionate.
p211
aVAnd God," he said to the poor man, "is answering your plea
p212
aVthat people should be compassionate and give."
p213
aVHe looked at the rich man. He held the rich man's hands and said,
p214
aV"Don't you understand?" He said, "These are the hands of God."
p215
aa(lp216
VSo that is the way I feel:
p217
aVthat I can only try to approach this notion of being compassionate,
p218
aVof understanding that there is a connectivity, that there is a unity in this world;
p219
aVthat I want to try and serve that unity,
p220
aVand that I can try and do that by understanding, I hope,
p221
aVtrying to understand something of the pain of others;
p222
aVbut understanding that there are limits, that people have to bear responsibility
p223
aVfor some of the problems that come upon them;
p224
aVand that I have to understand that there are limits to my energy,
p225
aVto the giving I can give.
p226
aVI have to reevaluate them,
p227
aVtry and separate out the material things
p228
aVand my emotions that may be enslaving me,
p229
aVso that I can see the world clearly.
p230
aa(lp231
VAnd then I have to try to see in what ways
p232
aVI can make these the hands of God.
p233
aVAnd so try to bring compassion to life in this world.
