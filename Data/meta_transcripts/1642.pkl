VSo if you've been following the news,
p4
aVyou've heard that there's a pack of giant asteroids
p5
aVheaded for the United States,
p6
aVall scheduled to strike within the next 50 years.
p7
aVNow I don't mean actual asteroids made of rock and metal.
p8
aVThat actually wouldn't be such a problem,
p9
aVbecause if we were really all going to die,
p10
aVwe would put aside our differences, we'd spend whatever it took,
p11
aVand we'd find a way to deflect them.
p12
aVI'm talking instead about threats that are headed our way,
p13
aVbut they're wrapped in a special energy field
p14
aVthat polarizes us, and therefore paralyzes us.
p15
aa(lp16
VLast March, I went to the TED conference,
p17
aVand I saw Jim Hansen speak, the NASA scientist
p18
aVwho first raised the alarm about global warming in the 1980s,
p19
aVand it seems that the predictions he made back then
p20
aVare coming true.
p21
aVThis is where we're headed in terms of global temperature rises,
p22
aVand if we keep on going the way we're going,
p23
aVwe get a four- or five-degree-Centigrade temperature rise
p24
aVby the end of this century.
p25
aVHansen says we can expect about a five-meter rise in sea levels.
p26
aVThis is what a five-meter rise in sea levels would look like.
p27
aVLow-lying cities all around the world will disappear
p28
aVwithin the lifetime of children born today.
p29
aVHansen closed his talk by saying,
p30
aV"Imagine a giant asteroid on a collision course with Earth.
p31
aVThat is the equivalent of what we face now.
p32
aVYet we dither, taking no action to deflect the asteroid,
p33
aVeven though the longer we wait,
p34
aVthe more difficult and expensive it becomes."
p35
aVOf course, the left wants to take action,
p36
aVbut the right denies that there's any problem.
p37
aa(lp38
VAll right, so I go back from TED,
p39
aVand then the following week, I'm invited to a dinner party
p40
aVin Washington, D.C., where I know that I'll be meeting
p41
aVa number of conservative intellectuals, including Yuval Levin,
p42
aVand to prepare for the meeting, I read this article by Levin
p43
aVin National Affairs called "Beyond the Welfare State."
p44
aVLevin writes that all over the world,
p45
aVnations are coming to terms with the fact
p46
aVthat the social democratic welfare state
p47
aVis turning out to be untenable and unaffordable,
p48
aVdependent upon dubious economics
p49
aVand the demographic model of a bygone era.
p50
aa(lp51
VAll right, now this might not sound as scary as an asteroid,
p52
aVbut look at these graphs that Levin showed.
p53
aVThis graph shows the national debt
p54
aVas a percentage of America's GDP, and as you see,
p55
aVif you go all the way back to the founding,
p56
aVwe borrowed a lot of money to fight the Revolutionary War.
p57
aVWars are expensive. But then we'd pay it off, pay it off, pay it off,
p58
aVand then, oh, what's this? The Civil War. Even more expensive.
p59
aVBorrow a lot of money, pay it off, pay it off, pay it off,
p60
aVget down to near zero, and bang! \u2014 World War I.
p61
aVOnce again, the same process repeats.
p62
aVNow then we get the Great Depression and World War II.
p63
aVWe rise to an astronomical level, around 118 percent of GDP,
p64
aVreally unsustainable, really dangerous.
p65
aVBut we pay it off, pay it off, pay it off, and then, what's this?
p66
aVWhy has it been rising since the '70s?
p67
aVIt's partly due to tax cuts that were unfunded,
p68
aVbut it's due primarily to the rise of entitlement spending,
p69
aVespecially Medicare.
p70
aVWe're approaching the levels of indebtedness we had at World War II,
p71
aVand the baby boomers haven't even retired yet,
p72
aVand when they do, this is what will happen.
p73
aVThis is data from the Congressional Budget Office
p74
aVshowing its most realistic forecast of what would happen
p75
aVif current situations and expectations and trends are extended.
p76
aa(lp77
VAll right, now what you might notice is that these two graphs
p78
aVare actually identical, not in terms of the x- and y-axes,
p79
aVor in terms of the data they present,
p80
aVbut in terms of their moral and political implications, they say the same thing.
p81
aVLet me translate for you.
p82
aa(lp83
V"We are doomed unless we start acting now.
p84
aVWhat's wrong with you people on the other side in the other party?
p85
aVCan't you see reality? If you won't help, then get the hell out of the way."
p86
aa(lp87
VWe can deflect both of these asteroids.
p88
aVThese problems are both technically solvable.
p89
aVOur problem and our tragedy is that in these hyper-partisan times,
p90
aVthe mere fact that one side says, "Look, there's an asteroid,"
p91
aVmeans that the other side's going to say, "Huh? What?
p92
aVNo, I'm not even going to look up. No."
p93
aa(lp94
VTo understand why this is happening to us,
p95
aVand what we can do about it, we need to learn more about moral psychology.
p96
aVSo I'm a social psychologist, and I study morality,
p97
aVand one of the most important principles of morality
p98
aVis that morality binds and blinds.
p99
aVIt binds us into teams that circle around sacred values
p100
aVbut thereby makes us go blind to objective reality.
p101
aa(lp102
VThink of it like this.
p103
aVLarge-scale cooperation is extremely rare on this planet.
p104
aVThere are only a few species that can do it.
p105
aVThat's a beehive. That's a termite mound, a giant termite mound.
p106
aVAnd when you find this in other animals, it's always the same story.
p107
aVThey're always all siblings who are children of a single queen,
p108
aVso they're all in the same boat.
p109
aVThey rise or fall, they live or die, as one.
p110
aVThere's only one species on the planet that can do this
p111
aVwithout kinship, and that, of course, is us.
p112
aVThis is a reconstruction of ancient Babylon,
p113
aVand this is Tenochtitlan.
p114
aa(lp115
VNow how did we do this? How did we go
p116
aVfrom being hunter-gatherers 10,000 years ago
p117
aVto building these gigantic cities in just a few thousand years?
p118
aVIt's miraculous, and part of the explanation
p119
aVis this ability to circle around sacred values.
p120
aVAs you see, temples and gods play a big role in all ancient civilizations.
p121
aVThis is an image of Muslims circling the Kaaba in Mecca.
p122
aVIt's a sacred rock, and when people circle something together,
p123
aVthey unite, they can trust each other, they become one.
p124
aVIt's as though you're moving an electrical wire
p125
aVthrough a magnetic field that generates current.
p126
aVWhen people circle together, they generate a current.
p127
aVWe love to circle around things.
p128
aVWe circle around flags, and then we can trust each other.
p129
aVWe can fight as a team, as a unit.
p130
aVBut even as morality binds people together into a unit,
p131
aVinto a team, the circling blinds them.
p132
aVIt causes them to distort reality.
p133
aVWe begin separating everything into good versus evil.
p134
aVNow that process feels great. It feels really satisfying.
p135
aVBut it is a gross distortion of reality.
p136
aa(lp137
VYou can see the moral electromagnet operating in the U.S. Congress.
p138
aVThis is a graph that shows the degree to which voting
p139
aVin Congress falls strictly along the left-right axis,
p140
aVso that if you know how liberal or conservative someone is,
p141
aVyou know exactly how they voted on all the major issues.
p142
aVAnd what you can see is that,
p143
aVin the decades after the Civil War,
p144
aVCongress was extraordinarily polarized,
p145
aVas you would expect, about as high as can be.
p146
aVBut then, after World War I, things dropped,
p147
aVand we get this historically low level of polarization.
p148
aVThis was a golden age of bipartisanship,
p149
aVat least in terms of the parties' ability to work together
p150
aVand solve grand national problems.
p151
aVBut in the 1980s and '90s, the electromagnet turns back on.
p152
aVPolarization rises.
p153
aVIt used to be that conservatives and moderates and liberals
p154
aVcould all work together in Congress.
p155
aVThey could rearrange themselves, form bipartisan committees,
p156
aVbut as the moral electromagnet got cranked up,
p157
aVthe force field increased,
p158
aVDemocrats and Republicans were pulled apart.
p159
aVIt became much harder for them to socialize,
p160
aVmuch harder for them to cooperate.
p161
aVRetiring members nowadays say that it's become like gang warfare.
p162
aVDid anybody notice that in two of the three debates,
p163
aVObama wore a blue tie and Romney wore a red tie?
p164
aVDo you know why they do this?
p165
aVIt's so that the Bloods and the Crips will know which side to vote for. (Laughter)
p166
aa(lp167
VThe polarization is strongest among our political elites.
p168
aVNobody doubts that this is happening in Washington.
p169
aVBut for a while, there was some doubt as to whether it was happening among the people.
p170
aVWell, in the last 12 years it's become
p171
aVmuch more apparent that it is.
p172
aVSo look at this data. This is from the American National Elections Survey.
p173
aVAnd what they do on that survey is they ask
p174
aVwhat's called a feeling thermometer rating.
p175
aVSo, how warm or cold do you feel about, you know,
p176
aVNative Americans, or the military, the Republican Party,
p177
aVthe Democratic Party, all sorts of groups in American life.
p178
aVThe blue line shows how warmly Democrats feel
p179
aVabout Democrats, and they like them.
p180
aVYou know, ratings in the 70s on a 100-point scale.
p181
aVRepublicans like Republicans. That's not a surprise.
p182
aVBut when you look at cross-party ratings,
p183
aVyou find, well, that it's lower, but actually,
p184
aVwhen I first saw this data, I was surprised.
p185
aVThat's actually not so bad. If you go back to the Carter and even Reagan administrations,
p186
aVthey were rating the other party 43, 45. It's not terrible.
p187
aVIt drifts downwards very slightly,
p188
aVbut now look what happens under George W. Bush and Obama.
p189
aVIt plummets. Something is going on here.
p190
aVThe moral electromagnet is turning back on,
p191
aVand nowadays, just very recently,
p192
aVDemocrats really dislike Republicans.
p193
aVRepublicans really dislike the Democrats. We're changing.
p194
aVIt's as though the moral electromagnet is affecting us too.
p195
aVIt's like put out in the two oceans and it's pulling the whole country apart,
p196
aVpulling left and right into their own territories
p197
aVlike the Bloods and the Crips.
p198
aa(lp199
VNow, there are many reasons why this is happening to us,
p200
aVand many of them we cannot reverse.
p201
aVWe will never again have a political class
p202
aVthat was forged by the experience of fighting together
p203
aVin World War II against a common enemy.
p204
aVWe will never again have just three television networks,
p205
aVall of which are relatively centrist.
p206
aVAnd we will never again have a large group of conservative southern Democrats
p207
aVand liberal northern Republicans making it easy,
p208
aVmaking there be a lot of overlap for bipartisan cooperation.
p209
aVSo for a lot of reasons, those decades after the Second World War
p210
aVwere an historically anomalous time.
p211
aVWe will never get back to those low levels of polarization, I believe.
p212
aa(lp213
VBut there's a lot that we can do. There are dozens
p214
aVand dozens of reforms we can do that will make things better,
p215
aVbecause a lot of our dysfunction can be traced directly
p216
aVto things that Congress did to itself in the 1990s
p217
aVthat created a much more polarized and dysfunctional institution.
p218
aVThese changes are detailed in many books.
p219
aVThese are two that I strongly recommend,
p220
aVand they list a whole bunch of reforms.
p221
aVI'm just going to group them into three broad classes here.
p222
aa(lp223
VSo if you think about this as the problem of a dysfunctional,
p224
aVhyper-polarized institution, well, the first step is,
p225
aVdo what you can so that fewer hyper-partisans get elected in the first place,
p226
aVand when you have closed party primaries,
p227
aVand only the most committed Republicans and Democrats are voting,
p228
aVyou're nominating and selecting the most extreme hyper-partisans.
p229
aVSo open primaries would make that problem much, much less severe.
p230
aa(lp231
VBut the problem isn't primarily that we're electing bad people to Congress.
p232
aVFrom my experience, and from what I've heard from Congressional insiders,
p233
aVmost of the people going to Congress are good, hard-working,
p234
aVintelligent people who really want to solve problems,
p235
aVbut once they get there, they find that they are forced
p236
aVto play a game that rewards hyper-partisanship
p237
aVand that punishes independent thinking.
p238
aVYou step out of line, you get punished.
p239
aVSo there are a lot of reforms we could do
p240
aVthat will counteract this.
p241
aa(lp242
VFor example, this "Citizens United" ruling is a disaster,
p243
aVbecause it means there's like a money gun aimed at your head,
p244
aVand if you step out of line, if you try to reach across the aisle,
p245
aVthere's a ton of money waiting to be given to your opponent
p246
aVto make everybody think that you are a terrible person through negative advertising.
p247
aa(lp248
VBut the third class of reforms is that we've got to change
p249
aVthe nature of social relationships in Congress.
p250
aVThe politicians I've met are generally very extroverted,
p251
aVfriendly, very socially skillful people,
p252
aVand that's the nature of politics. You've got to make relationships,
p253
aVmake deals, you've got to cajole, please, flatter,
p254
aVyou've got to use your personal skills,
p255
aVand that's the way politics has always worked.
p256
aVBut beginning in the 1990s, first the House of Representatives
p257
aVchanged its legislative calendar
p258
aVso that all business is basically done in the middle of the week.
p259
aVNowadays, Congressmen fly in on Tuesday morning,
p260
aVthey do battle for two days, then they fly home Thursday afternoon.
p261
aVThey don't move their families to the District.
p262
aVThey don't meet each other's spouses or children.
p263
aVThere's no more relationship there.
p264
aVAnd trying to run Congress without human relationships
p265
aVis like trying to run a car without motor oil.
p266
aVShould we be surprised when the whole thing freezes up
p267
aVand descends into paralysis and polarization?
p268
aVA simple change to the legislative calendar,
p269
aVsuch as having business stretch out for three weeks
p270
aVand then they get a week off to go home,
p271
aVthat would change the fundamental relationships in Congress.
p272
aa(lp273
VSo there's a lot we can do, but who's going to push them to do it?
p274
aVThere are a number of groups that are working on this.
p275
aVNo Labels and Common Cause, I think,
p276
aVhave very good ideas for changes we need to do
p277
aVto make our democracy more responsive and our Congress more effective.
p278
aa(lp279
VBut I'd like to supplement their work
p280
aVwith a little psychological trick, and the trick is this.
p281
aVNothing pulls people together like a common threat
p282
aVor a common attack, especially an attack from a foreign enemy,
p283
aVunless of course that threat hits on our polarized psychology,
p284
aVin which case, as I said before, it can actually pull us apart.
p285
aVSometimes a single threat can polarize us, as we saw.
p286
aVBut what if the situation we face is not a single threat
p287
aVbut is actually more like this,
p288
aVwhere there's just so much stuff coming in,
p289
aVit's just, "Start shooting, come on, everybody,
p290
aVwe've got to just work together, just start shooting."
p291
aVBecause actually, we do face this situation.
p292
aVThis is where we are as a country.
p293
aa(lp294
VSo here's another asteroid.
p295
aVWe've all seen versions of this graph, right,
p296
aVwhich shows the changes in wealth since 1979,
p297
aVand as you can see, almost all the gains in wealth
p298
aVhave gone to the top 20 percent, and especially the top one percent.
p299
aVRising inequality like this is associated
p300
aVwith so many problems for a democracy.
p301
aVEspecially, it destroys our ability to trust each other,
p302
aVto feel that we're all in the same boat, because it's obvious we're not.
p303
aVSome of us are sitting there safe and sound in gigantic private yachts.
p304
aVOther people are clinging to a piece of driftwood.
p305
aVWe're not all in the same boat, and that means
p306
aVnobody's willing to sacrifice for the common good.
p307
aVThe left has been screaming about this asteroid for 30 years now,
p308
aVand the right says, "Huh, what? Hmm? No problem. No problem."
p309
aa(lp310
VNow,
p311
aVwhy is that happening to us? Why is the inequality rising?
p312
aVWell, one of the largest causes, after globalization,
p313
aVis actually this fourth asteroid,
p314
aVrising non-marital births.
p315
aVThis graph shows the steady rise of out-of-wedlock births
p316
aVsince the 1960s.
p317
aVMost Hispanic and black children are now born to unmarried mothers.
p318
aVWhites are headed that way too.
p319
aVWithin a decade or two, most American children
p320
aVwill be born into homes with no father.
p321
aVThis means that there's much less money coming into the house.
p322
aVBut it's not just money. It's also stability versus chaos.
p323
aVAs I know from working with street children in Brazil,
p324
aVMom's boyfriend is often a really, really dangerous person for kids.
p325
aa(lp326
VNow the right has been screaming about this asteroid since the 1960s,
p327
aVand the left has been saying, "It's not a problem. It's not a problem."
p328
aVThe left has been very reluctant to say
p329
aVthat marriage is actually good for women and for children.
p330
aVNow let me be clear. I'm not blaming the women here.
p331
aVI'm actually more critical of the men
p332
aVwho won't take responsibility for their own children
p333
aVand of an economic system that makes it difficult
p334
aVfor many men to earn enough money to support those children.
p335
aVBut even if you blame nobody, it still is a national problem,
p336
aVand one side has been more concerned about it than the other.
p337
aVThe New York Times finally noticed this asteroid
p338
aVwith a front-page story last July
p339
aVshowing how the decline of marriage contributes to inequality.
p340
aa(lp341
VWe are becoming a nation of just two classes.
p342
aVWhen Americans go to college and marry each other,
p343
aVthey have very low divorce rates.
p344
aVThey earn a lot of money, they invest that money in their kids,
p345
aVsome of them become tiger mothers,
p346
aVthe kids rise to their full potential,
p347
aVand the kids go on to become
p348
aVthe top two lines in this graph.
p349
aVAnd then there's everybody else:
p350
aVthe children who don't benefit from a stable marriage,
p351
aVwho don't have as much invested in them,
p352
aVwho don't grow up in a stable environment,
p353
aVand who go on to become the bottom three lines in that graph.
p354
aa(lp355
VSo once again, we see that these two graphs are actually saying the same thing.
p356
aVAs before, we've got a problem, we've got to start working on this,
p357
aVwe've got to do something,
p358
aVand what's wrong with you people that you don't see my threat?
p359
aa(lp360
VBut if everybody could just take off their partisan blinders,
p361
aVwe'd see that these two problems actually
p362
aVare best addressed together.
p363
aVBecause if you really care about income inequality,
p364
aVyou might want to talk to some evangelical Christian groups
p365
aVthat are working on ways to promote marriage.
p366
aVBut then you're going to run smack into the problem
p367
aVthat women don't generally want to marry someone
p368
aVwho doesn't have a job.
p369
aVSo if you really care about strengthening families,
p370
aVyou might want to talk to some liberal groups
p371
aVwho are working on promoting educational equality,
p372
aVwho are working on raising the minimum wage,
p373
aVwho are working on finding ways to stop so many men
p374
aVfrom being sucked into the criminal justice system and
p375
aVtaken out of the marriage market for their whole lives.
p376
aa(lp377
VSo to conclude, there are at least four asteroids headed our way.
p378
aVHow many of you can see all four?
p379
aVPlease raise your hand right now if you're willing to admit
p380
aVthat all four of these are national problems.
p381
aVPlease raise your hands.
p382
aVOkay, almost all of you.
p383
aa(lp384
VWell, congratulations, you guys are the inaugural members
p385
aVof the Asteroids Club, which is a club
p386
aVfor all Americans who are willing to admit
p387
aVthat the other side actually might have a point.
p388
aVIn the Asteroids Club, we don't start by looking for common ground.
p389
aVCommon ground is often very hard to find.
p390
aVNo, we start by looking for common threats
p391
aVbecause common threats make common ground.
p392
aa(lp393
VNow, am I being naive? Is it naive to think
p394
aVthat people could ever lay down their swords,
p395
aVand left and right could actually work together?
p396
aVI don't think so, because it happens,
p397
aVnot all that often, but there are a variety of examples that point the way.
p398
aVThis is something we can do.
p399
aVBecause Americans on both sides care about the decline in civility,
p400
aVand they've formed dozens of organizations,
p401
aVat the national level, such as this one,
p402
aVdown to many local organizations,
p403
aVsuch as To The Village Square in Tallahassee, Florida,
p404
aVwhich tries to bring state leaders together to help facilitate
p405
aVthat sort of working together human relationship
p406
aVthat's necessary to solve Florida's problems.
p407
aVAmericans on both sides care about global poverty and AIDS,
p408
aVand on so many humanitarian issues,
p409
aVliberals and evangelicals are actually natural allies,
p410
aVand at times they really have worked together
p411
aVto solve these problems.
p412
aVAnd most surprisingly to me, they sometimes can even see
p413
aVeye to eye on criminal justice.
p414
aVFor example, the incarceration rate, the prison population
