VSo in 1885, Karl Benz invented the automobile.
p4
aVLater that year, he took it out for the first public test drive,
p5
aVand \u2014 true story \u2014 crashed into a wall.
p6
aVFor the last 130 years,
p7
aVwe've been working around that least reliable part of the car, the driver.
p8
aVWe've made the car stronger.
p9
aVWe've added seat belts, we've added air bags,
p10
aVand in the last decade, we've actually started trying to make the car smarter
p11
aVto fix that bug, the driver.
p12
aa(lp13
VNow, today I'm going to talk to you a little bit about the difference
p14
aVbetween patching around the problem with driver assistance systems
p15
aVand actually having fully self-driving cars
p16
aVand what they can do for the world.
p17
aVI'm also going to talk to you a little bit about our car
p18
aVand allow you to see how it sees the world and how it reacts and what it does,
p19
aVbut first I'm going to talk a little bit about the problem.
p20
aVAnd it's a big problem:
p21
aV1.2 million people are killed on the world's roads every year.
p22
aVIn America alone, 33,000 people are killed each year.
p23
aVTo put that in perspective,
p24
aVthat's the same as a 737 falling out of the sky every working day.
p25
aVIt's kind of unbelievable.
p26
aVCars are sold to us like this,
p27
aVbut really, this is what driving's like.
p28
aVRight? It's not sunny, it's rainy,
p29
aVand you want to do anything other than drive.
p30
aVAnd the reason why is this:
p31
aVTraffic is getting worse.
p32
aVIn America, between 1990 and 2010,
p33
aVthe vehicle miles traveled increased by 38 percent.
p34
aVWe grew by six percent of roads,
p35
aVso it's not in your brains.
p36
aVTraffic really is substantially worse than it was not very long ago.
p37
aa(lp38
VAnd all of this has a very human cost.
p39
aVSo if you take the average commute time in America, which is about 50 minutes,
p40
aVyou multiply that by the 120 million workers we have,
p41
aVthat turns out to be about six billion minutes
p42
aVwasted in commuting every day.
p43
aVNow, that's a big number, so let's put it in perspective.
p44
aVYou take that six billion minutes
p45
aVand you divide it by the average life expectancy of a person,
p46
aVthat turns out to be 162 lifetimes
p47
aVspent every day, wasted,
p48
aVjust getting from A to B.
p49
aVIt's unbelievable.
p50
aVAnd then, there are those of us who don't have the privilege
p51
aVof sitting in traffic.
p52
aVSo this is Steve.
p53
aVHe's an incredibly capable guy,
p54
aVbut he just happens to be blind,
p55
aVand that means instead of a 30-minute drive to work in the morning,
p56
aVit's a two-hour ordeal of piecing together bits of public transit
p57
aVor asking friends and family for a ride.
p58
aVHe doesn't have that same freedom that you and I have to get around.
p59
aVWe should do something about that.
p60
aa(lp61
VNow, conventional wisdom would say
p62
aVthat we'll just take these driver assistance systems
p63
aVand we'll kind of push them and incrementally improve them,
p64
aVand over time, they'll turn into self-driving cars.
p65
aVWell, I'm here to tell you that's like me saying
p66
aVthat if I work really hard at jumping, one day I'll be able to fly.
p67
aVWe actually need to do something a little different.
p68
aVAnd so I'm going to talk to you about three different ways
p69
aVthat self-driving systems are different than driver assistance systems.
p70
aVAnd I'm going to start with some of our own experience.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo back in 2013,
p73
aVwe had the first test of a self-driving car
p74
aVwhere we let regular people use it.
p75
aVWell, almost regular \u2014 they were 100 Googlers,
p76
aVbut they weren't working on the project.
p77
aVAnd we gave them the car and we allowed them to use it in their daily lives.
p78
aVBut unlike a real self-driving car, this one had a big asterisk with it:
p79
aVThey had to pay attention,
p80
aVbecause this was an experimental vehicle.
p81
aVWe tested it a lot, but it could still fail.
p82
aVAnd so we gave them two hours of training,
p83
aVwe put them in the car, we let them use it,
p84
aVand what we heard back was something awesome,
p85
aVas someone trying to bring a product into the world.
p86
aVEvery one of them told us they loved it.
p87
aVIn fact, we had a Porsche driver who came in and told us on the first day,
p88
aV"This is completely stupid. What are we thinking?"
p89
aVBut at the end of it, he said, "Not only should I have it,
p90
aVeveryone else should have it, because people are terrible drivers."
p91
aVSo this was music to our ears,
p92
aVbut then we started to look at what the people inside the car were doing,
p93
aVand this was eye-opening.
p94
aVNow, my favorite story is this gentleman
p95
aVwho looks down at his phone and realizes the battery is low,
p96
aVso he turns around like this in the car and digs around in his backpack,
p97
aVpulls out his laptop,
p98
aVputs it on the seat,
p99
aVgoes in the back again,
p100
aVdigs around, pulls out the charging cable for his phone,
p101
aVfutzes around, puts it into the laptop, puts it on the phone.
p102
aVSure enough, the phone is charging.
p103
aVAll the time he's been doing 65 miles per hour down the freeway.
p104
aVRight? Unbelievable.
p105
aVSo we thought about this and we said, it's kind of obvious, right?
p106
aVThe better the technology gets,
p107
aVthe less reliable the driver is going to get.
p108
aVSo by just making the cars incrementally smarter,
p109
aVwe're probably not going to see the wins we really need.
p110
aa(lp111
VLet me talk about something a little technical for a moment here.
p112
aVSo we're looking at this graph, and along the bottom
p113
aVis how often does the car apply the brakes when it shouldn't.
p114
aVYou can ignore most of that axis,
p115
aVbecause if you're driving around town, and the car starts stopping randomly,
p116
aVyou're never going to buy that car.
p117
aVAnd the vertical axis is how often the car is going to apply the brakes
p118
aVwhen it's supposed to to help you avoid an accident.
p119
aVNow, if we look at the bottom left corner here,
p120
aVthis is your classic car.
p121
aVIt doesn't apply the brakes for you, it doesn't do anything goofy,
p122
aVbut it also doesn't get you out of an accident.
p123
aVNow, if we want to bring a driver assistance system into a car,
p124
aVsay with collision mitigation braking,
p125
aVwe're going to put some package of technology on there,
p126
aVand that's this curve, and it's going to have some operating properties,
p127
aVbut it's never going to avoid all of the accidents,
p128
aVbecause it doesn't have that capability.
p129
aVBut we'll pick some place along the curve here,
p130
aVand maybe it avoids half of accidents that the human driver misses,
p131
aVand that's amazing, right?
p132
aVWe just reduced accidents on our roads by a factor of two.
p133
aVThere are now 17,000 less people dying every year in America.
p134
aa(lp135
VBut if we want a self-driving car,
p136
aVwe need a technology curve that looks like this.
p137
aVWe're going to have to put more sensors in the vehicle,
p138
aVand we'll pick some operating point up here
p139
aVwhere it basically never gets into a crash.
p140
aVThey'll happen, but very low frequency.
p141
aVNow you and I could look at this and we could argue
p142
aVabout whether it's incremental, and I could say something like "80-20 rule,"
p143
aVand it's really hard to move up to that new curve.
p144
aVBut let's look at it from a different direction for a moment.
p145
aVSo let's look at how often the technology has to do the right thing.
p146
aVAnd so this green dot up here is a driver assistance system.
p147
aVIt turns out that human drivers
p148
aVmake mistakes that lead to traffic accidents
p149
aVabout once every 100,000 miles in America.
p150
aVIn contrast, a self-driving system is probably making decisions
p151
aVabout 10 times per second,
p152
aVso order of magnitude,
p153
aVthat's about 1,000 times per mile.
p154
aVSo if you compare the distance between these two,
p155
aVit's about 10 to the eighth, right?
p156
aVEight orders of magnitude.
p157
aVThat's like comparing how fast I run
p158
aVto the speed of light.
p159
aVIt doesn't matter how hard I train, I'm never actually going to get there.
p160
aVSo there's a pretty big gap there.
p161
aa(lp162
VAnd then finally, there's how the system can handle uncertainty.
p163
aVSo this pedestrian here might be stepping into the road, might not be.
p164
aVI can't tell, nor can any of our algorithms,
p165
aVbut in the case of a driver assistance system,
p166
aVthat means it can't take action, because again,
p167
aVif it presses the brakes unexpectedly, that's completely unacceptable.
p168
aVWhereas a self-driving system can look at that pedestrian and say,
p169
aVI don't know what they're about to do,
p170
aVslow down, take a better look, and then react appropriately after that.
p171
aa(lp172
VSo it can be much safer than a driver assistance system can ever be.
p173
aVSo that's enough about the differences between the two.
p174
aVLet's spend some time talking about how the car sees the world.
p175
aa(lp176
VSo this is our vehicle.
p177
aVIt starts by understanding where it is in the world,
p178
aVby taking a map and its sensor data and aligning the two,
p179
aVand then we layer on top of that what it sees in the moment.
p180
aVSo here, all the purple boxes you can see are other vehicles on the road,
p181
aVand the red thing on the side over there is a cyclist,
p182
aVand up in the distance, if you look really closely,
p183
aVyou can see some cones.
p184
aVThen we know where the car is in the moment,
p185
aVbut we have to do better than that: we have to predict what's going to happen.
p186
aVSo here the pickup truck in top right is about to make a left lane change
p187
aVbecause the road in front of it is closed,
p188
aVso it needs to get out of the way.
p189
aVKnowing that one pickup truck is great,
p190
aVbut we really need to know what everybody's thinking,
p191
aVso it becomes quite a complicated problem.
p192
aVAnd then given that, we can figure out how the car should respond in the moment,
p193
aVso what trajectory it should follow, how quickly it should slow down or speed up.
p194
aVAnd then that all turns into just following a path:
p195
aVturning the steering wheel left or right, pressing the brake or gas.
p196
aVIt's really just two numbers at the end of the day.
p197
aVSo how hard can it really be?
p198
aa(lp199
VBack when we started in 2009,
p200
aVthis is what our system looked like.
p201
aVSo you can see our car in the middle and the other boxes on the road,
p202
aVdriving down the highway.
p203
aVThe car needs to understand where it is and roughly where the other vehicles are.
p204
aVIt's really a geometric understanding of the world.
p205
aVOnce we started driving on neighborhood and city streets,
p206
aVthe problem becomes a whole new level of difficulty.
p207
aVYou see pedestrians crossing in front of us, cars crossing in front of us,
p208
aVgoing every which way,
p209
aVthe traffic lights, crosswalks.
p210
aVIt's an incredibly complicated problem by comparison.
p211
aVAnd then once you have that problem solved,
p212
aVthe vehicle has to be able to deal with construction.
p213
aVSo here are the cones on the left forcing it to drive to the right,
p214
aVbut not just construction in isolation, of course.
p215
aVIt has to deal with other people moving through that construction zone as well.
p216
aVAnd of course, if anyone's breaking the rules, the police are there
p217
aVand the car has to understand that that flashing light on the top of the car
p218
aVmeans that it's not just a car, it's actually a police officer.
p219
aVSimilarly, the orange box on the side here,
p220
aVit's a school bus,
p221
aVand we have to treat that differently as well.
p222
aa(lp223
VWhen we're out on the road, other people have expectations:
p224
aVSo, when a cyclist puts up their arm,
p225
aVit means they're expecting the car to yield to them and make room for them
p226
aVto make a lane change.
p227
aVAnd when a police officer stood in the road,
p228
aVour vehicle should understand that this means stop,
p229
aVand when they signal to go, we should continue.
p230
aa(lp231
VNow, the way we accomplish this is by sharing data between the vehicles.
p232
aVThe first, most crude model of this
p233
aVis when one vehicle sees a construction zone,
p234
aVhaving another know about it so it can be in the correct lane
p235
aVto avoid some of the difficulty.
p236
aVBut we actually have a much deeper understanding of this.
p237
aVWe could take all of the data that the cars have seen over time,
p238
aVthe hundreds of thousands of pedestrians, cyclists,
p239
aVand vehicles that have been out there
p240
aVand understand what they look like
p241
aVand use that to infer what other vehicles should look like
p242
aVand other pedestrians should look like.
p243
aVAnd then, even more importantly, we could take from that a model
p244
aVof how we expect them to move through the world.
p245
aVSo here the yellow box is a pedestrian crossing in front of us.
p246
aVHere the blue box is a cyclist and we anticipate
p247
aVthat they're going to nudge out and around the car to the right.
p248
aVHere there's a cyclist coming down the road
p249
aVand we know they're going to continue to drive down the shape of the road.
p250
aVHere somebody makes a right turn,
p251
aVand in a moment here, somebody's going to make a U-turn in front of us,
p252
aVand we can anticipate that behavior and respond safely.
p253
aa(lp254
VNow, that's all well and good for things that we've seen,
p255
aVbut of course, you encounter lots of things that you haven't
p256
aVseen in the world before.
p257
aVAnd so just a couple of months ago,
p258
aVour vehicles were driving through Mountain View,
p259
aVand this is what we encountered.
p260
aVThis is a woman in an electric wheelchair
p261
aVchasing a duck in circles on the road. (Laughter)
p262
aVNow it turns out, there is nowhere in the DMV handbook
p263
aVthat tells you how to deal with that,
p264
aVbut our vehicles were able to encounter that,
p265
aVslow down, and drive safely.
p266
aVNow, we don't have to deal with just ducks.
p267
aVWatch this bird fly across in front of us. The car reacts to that.
p268
aVHere we're dealing with a cyclist
p269
aVthat you would never expect to see anywhere other than Mountain View.
p270
aVAnd of course, we have to deal with drivers,
p271
aVeven the very small ones.
p272
aVWatch to the right as someone jumps out of this truck at us.
p273
aVAnd now, watch the left as the car with the green box decides
p274
aVhe needs to make a right turn at the last possible moment.
p275
aVHere, as we make a lane change, the car to our left decides
p276
aVit wants to as well.
p277
aVAnd here, we watch a car blow through a red light
p278
aVand yield to it.
p279
aVAnd similarly, here, a cyclist blowing through that light as well.
p280
aVAnd of course, the vehicle responds safely.
p281
aVAnd of course, we have people who do I don't know what
p282
aVsometimes on the road, like this guy pulling out between two self-driving cars.
p283
aVYou have to ask, "What are you thinking?"
p284
aV(Laughter)
p285
aa(lp286
VNow, I just fire-hosed you with a lot of stuff there,
p287
aVso I'm going to break one of these down pretty quickly.
p288
aVSo what we're looking at is the scene with the cyclist again,
p289
aVand you might notice in the bottom, we can't actually see the cyclist yet,
p290
aVbut the car can: it's that little blue box up there,
p291
aVand that comes from the laser data.
p292
aVAnd that's not actually really easy to understand,
p293
aVso what I'm going to do is I'm going to turn that laser data and look at it,
p294
aVand if you're really good at looking at laser data, you can see
p295
aVa few dots on the curve there,
p296
aVright there, and that blue box is that cyclist.
p297
aVNow as our light is red,
p298
aVthe cyclist's light has turned yellow already,
p299
aVand if you squint, you can see that in the imagery.
p300
aVBut the cyclist, we see, is going to proceed through the intersection.
p301
aVOur light has now turned green, his is solidly red,
p302
aVand we now anticipate that this bike is going to come all the way across.
p303
aVUnfortunately the other drivers next to us were not paying as much attention.
p304
aVThey started to pull forward, and fortunately for everyone,
p305
aVthis cyclists reacts, avoids,
p306
aVand makes it through the intersection.
p307
aVAnd off we go.
p308
aa(lp309
VNow, as you can see, we've made some pretty exciting progress,
p310
aVand at this point we're pretty convinced
p311
aVthis technology is going to come to market.
p312
aVWe do three million miles of testing in our simulators every single day,
p313
aVso you can imagine the experience that our vehicles have.
p314
aVWe are looking forward to having this technology on the road,
p315
aVand we think the right path is to go through the self-driving
p316
aVrather than driver assistance approach
p317
aVbecause the urgency is so large.
p318
aVIn the time I have given this talk today,
p319
aV34 people have died on America's roads.
p320
aa(lp321
VHow soon can we bring it out?
p322
aVWell, it's hard to say because it's a really complicated problem,
p323
aVbut these are my two boys.
p324
aVMy oldest son is 11, and that means in four and a half years,
p325
aVhe's going to be able to get his driver's license.
p326
aVMy team and I are committed to making sure that doesn't happen.
p327
aa(lp328
VThank you.
p329
aa(lp330
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p331
aVChris Anderson: Chris, I've got a question for you.
p332
aa(lp333
VChris Urmson: Sure.
p334
aa(lp335
VCA: So certainly, the mind of your cars is pretty mind-boggling.
p336
aVOn this debate between driver-assisted and fully driverless \u2014
p337
aVI mean, there's a real debate going on out there right now.
p338
aVSo some of the companies, for example, Tesla,
p339
aVare going the driver-assisted route.
p340
aVWhat you're saying is that that's kind of going to be a dead end
p341
aVbecause you can't just keep improving that route and get to fully driverless
p342
aVat some point, and then a driver is going to say, "This feels safe,"
p343
aVand climb into the back, and something ugly will happen.
p344
aa(lp345
VCU: Right. No, that's exactly right, and it's not to say
p346
aVthat the driver assistance systems aren't going to be incredibly valuable.
p347
aVThey can save a lot of lives in the interim,
p348
aVbut to see the transformative opportunity to help someone like Steve get around,
p349
aVto really get to the end case in safety,
p350
aVto have the opportunity to change our cities
p351
aVand move parking out and get rid of these urban craters we call parking lots,
p352
aVit's the only way to go.
p353
aa(lp354
VCA: We will be tracking your progress with huge interest.
p355
aVThanks so much, Chris. CU: Thank you. (Applause)
