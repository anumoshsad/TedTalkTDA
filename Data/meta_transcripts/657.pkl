VI'm Dr. David Hanson, and I build robots with character.
p4
aVAnd by that, I mean
p5
aVthat I develop robots that are characters,
p6
aVbut also robots that will eventually
p7
aVcome to empathize with you.
p8
aVSo we're starting with a variety of technologies
p9
aVthat have converged into these conversational character robots
p10
aVthat can see faces, make eye contact with you,
p11
aVmake a full range of facial expressions, understand speech
p12
aVand begin to model how you're feeling
p13
aVand who you are, and build a relationship with you.
p14
aa(lp15
VI developed a series of technologies
p16
aVthat allowed the robots to make more realistic facial expressions
p17
aVthan previously achieved, on lower power,
p18
aVwhich enabled the walking biped robots, the first androids.
p19
aVSo, it's a full range of facial expressions
p20
aVsimulating all the major muscles in the human face,
p21
aVrunning on very small batteries,
p22
aVextremely lightweight.
p23
aa(lp24
VThe materials that allowed the battery-operated facial expressions
p25
aVis a material that we call Frubber,
p26
aVand it actually has three major innovations
p27
aVin the material that allow this to happen.
p28
aVOne is hierarchical pores,
p29
aVand the other is a macro-molecular nanoscale porosity in the material.
p30
aa(lp31
VThere he's starting to walk.
p32
aVThis is at the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology.
p33
aVI built the head. They built the body.
p34
aVSo the goal here is to achieve sentience in machines,
p35
aVand not just sentience, but empathy.
p36
aa(lp37
VWe're working with the Machine Perception Laboratory
p38
aVat the U.C. San Diego.
p39
aVThey have this really remarkable facial expression technology
p40
aVthat recognizes facial expressions,
p41
aVwhat facial expressions you're making.
p42
aVIt also recognizes where you're looking, your head orientation.
p43
aVWe're emulating all the major facial expressions,
p44
aVand then controlling it with the software
p45
aVthat we call the Character Engine.
p46
aVAnd here is a little bit of the technology that's involved in that.
p47
aa(lp48
VIn fact, right now \u2014 plug it from here, and then plug it in here,
p49
aVand now let's see if it gets my facial expressions.
p50
aVOkay. So I'm smiling.
p51
aV(Laughter)
p52
aVNow I'm frowning.
p53
aVAnd this is really heavily backlit.
p54
aVOkay, here we go.
p55
aVOh, it's so sad.
p56
aVOkay, so you smile, frowning.
p57
aVSo his perception of your emotional states
p58
aVis very important for machines to effectively become empathetic.
p59
aa(lp60
VMachines are becoming devastatingly capable
p61
aVof things like killing. Right?
p62
aVThose machines have no place for empathy.
p63
aVAnd there is billions of dollars being spent on that.
p64
aVCharacter robotics could plant the seed
p65
aVfor robots that actually have empathy.
p66
aVSo, if they achieve human level intelligence
p67
aVor, quite possibly, greater than human levels of intelligence,
p68
aVthis could be the seeds of hope for our future.
p69
aa(lp70
VSo, we've made 20 robots in the last eight years, during the course of getting my Ph.D.
p71
aVAnd then I started Hanson Robotics,
p72
aVwhich has been developing these things for mass manufacturing.
p73
aVThis is one of our robots
p74
aVthat we showed at Wired NextFest a couple of years ago.
p75
aVAnd it sees multiple people in a scene,
p76
aVremembers where individual people are,
p77
aVand looks from person to person, remembering people.
p78
aa(lp79
VSo, we're involving two things.
p80
aVOne, the perception of people,
p81
aVand two, the natural interface,
p82
aVthe natural form of the interface,
p83
aVso that it's more intuitive for you to interact with the robot.
p84
aVYou start to believe that it's alive and aware.
p85
aa(lp86
VSo one of my favorite projects was bringing all this stuff together
p87
aVin an artistic display of an android portrait
p88
aVof science-fiction writer Philip K. Dick,
p89
aVwho wrote great works like, "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"
p90
aVwhich was the basis of the movie "Bladerunner."
p91
aVIn these stories, robots often think
p92
aVthat they're human, and they sort of come to life.
p93
aVSo we put his writings, letters,
p94
aVhis interviews, correspondences,
p95
aVinto a huge database of thousands of pages,
p96
aVand then used some natural language processing
p97
aVto allow you to actually have a conversation with him.
p98
aVAnd it was kind of spooky, because he would say these things
p99
aVthat just sounded like they really understood you.
p100
aa(lp101
VAnd this is one of the most exciting projects that we're developing,
p102
aVwhich is a little character that's a spokesbot
p103
aVfor friendly artificial intelligence, friendly machine intelligence.
p104
aVAnd we're getting this mass-manufactured.
p105
aVWe specked it out to actually be doable
p106
aVwith a very, very low-cost bill of materials,
p107
aVso that it can become a childhood companion for kids.
p108
aVInterfacing with the Internet, it gets smarter over the years.
p109
aVAs artificial intelligence evolves, so does his intelligence.
