VI want to start out by asking you to think back to when you were a kid,
p4
aVplaying with blocks.
p5
aVAs you figured out how to reach out and grasp,
p6
aVpick them up and move them around,
p7
aVyou were actually learning how to think and solve problems
p8
aVby understanding and manipulating spatial relationships.
p9
aVSpatial reasoning is deeply connected
p10
aVto how we understand a lot of the world around us.
p11
aa(lp12
VSo, as a computer scientist
p13
aVinspired by this utility of our interactions with physical objects \u2014
p14
aValong with my adviser Pattie, and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi \u2014
p15
aVI started to wonder \u2014 what if when we used a computer,
p16
aVinstead of having this one mouse cursor that was a like a digital fingertip
p17
aVmoving around a flat desktop,
p18
aVwhat if we could reach in with both hands and grasp information physically,
p19
aVarranging it the way we wanted?
p20
aVThis question was so compelling that we decided to explore the answer,
p21
aVby building Siftables.
p22
aa(lp23
VIn a nutshell, a Siftable is an interactive computer
p24
aVthe size of a cookie.
p25
aVThey're able to be moved around by hand,
p26
aVthey can sense each other, they can sense their motion,
p27
aVand they have a screen and a wireless radio.
p28
aVMost importantly, they're physical,
p29
aVso like the blocks, you can move them just by reaching out and grasping.
p30
aVAnd Siftables are an example of a new ecosystem
p31
aVof tools for manipulating digital information.
p32
aVAnd as these tools become more physical,
p33
aVmore aware of their motion, aware of each other,
p34
aVand aware of the nuance of how we move them,
p35
aVwe can start to explore some new and fun interaction styles.
p36
aVSo, I'm going to start with some simple examples.
p37
aa(lp38
VThis Siftable is configured to show video,
p39
aVand if I tilt it in one direction, it'll roll the video this way;
p40
aVif I tilt it the other way it rolls it backwards.
p41
aVAnd these interactive portraits are aware of each other.
p42
aVSo if I put them next to each other, they get interested.
p43
aVIf they get surrounded, they notice that too,
p44
aVthey might get a little flustered.
p45
aVAnd they can also sense their motion and tilt.
p46
aa(lp47
VOne of the interesting implications on interaction, we started to realize,
p48
aVwas that we could use everyday gestures on data,
p49
aVlike pouring a color the way we might pour a liquid.
p50
aVSo in this case, we've got three Siftables configured to be paint buckets
p51
aVand I can use them to pour color into that central one,
p52
aVwhere they get mixed.
p53
aVIf we overshoot, we can pour a little bit back.
p54
aa(lp55
VThere are also some neat possibilities for education,
p56
aVlike language, math and logic games
p57
aVwhere we want to give people the ability to try things quickly,
p58
aVand view the results immediately.
p59
aVSo here I'm \u2014
p60
aV(Applause)
p61
aVThis is a Fibonacci sequence that I'm making with a simple equation program.
p62
aa(lp63
VHere we have a word game that's kind of like a mash-up between Scrabble and Boggle.
p64
aVBasically, in every round
p65
aVyou get a randomly assigned letter on each Siftable,
p66
aVand as you try to make words it checks against a dictionary.
p67
aVThen, after about 30 seconds, it reshuffles,
p68
aVand you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try.
p69
aa(lp70
V(Applause)
p71
aVThank you.
p72
aV(Applause)
p73
aa(lp74
VSo these are some kids that came on a field trip to the Media Lab,
p75
aVand I managed to get them to try it out, and shoot a video.
p76
aVThey really loved it.
p77
aVAnd, one of the interesting things about this kind of application
p78
aVis that you don't have to give people many instructions.
p79
aVAll you have to say is, "Make words,"
p80
aVand they know exactly what to do.
p81
aa(lp82
VSo here's another few people trying it out.
p83
aVThat's our youngest beta tester, down there on the right.
p84
aVTurns out, all he wanted to do was to stack the Siftables up.
p85
aVSo to him, they were just blocks.
p86
aVNow, this is an interactive cartoon application.
p87
aVAnd we wanted to build a learning tool for language learners.
p88
aVAnd this is Felix, actually.
p89
aVAnd he can bring new characters into the scene,
p90
aVjust by lifting the Siftables off the table that have that character shown on them.
p91
aVHere, he's bringing the sun out.
p92
aa(lp93
VVideo: The sun is rising.
p94
aa(lp95
VDavid Merrill: Now he's brought a tractor into the scene.
p96
aa(lp97
VVideo: The orange tractor.
p98
aVGood job! Yeah!
p99
aa(lp100
VDM: So by shaking the Siftables and putting them next to each other
p101
aVhe can make the characters interact \u2014
p102
aa(lp103
VVideo: Woof!
p104
aa(lp105
VDM: inventing his own narrative.
p106
aa(lp107
VVideo: Hello!
p108
aa(lp109
VDM: It's an open-ended story,
p110
aVand he gets to decide how it unfolds.
p111
aa(lp112
VVideo: Fly away, cat.
p113
aa(lp114
VDM: So, the last example I have time to show you today
p115
aVis a music sequencing and live performance tool
p116
aVthat we've built recently,
p117
aVin which Siftables act as sounds
p118
aVlike lead, bass and drums.
p119
aVEach of these has four different variations,
p120
aVyou get to choose which one you want to use.
p121
aVAnd you can inject these sounds into a sequence
p122
aVthat you can assemble into the pattern that you want.
p123
aVAnd you inject it by just bumping up the sound Siftable against a sequence Siftable.
p124
aVThere are effects that you can control live, like reverb and filter.
p125
aVYou attach it to a particular sound and then tilt to adjust it.
p126
aVAnd then, overall effects like tempo and volume
p127
aVthat apply to the entire sequence.
p128
aVSo let's have a look.
p129
aa(lp130
VVideo: (Music)
p131
aa(lp132
VDM: We'll start by putting a lead
p133
aVinto two sequence Siftables, arrange them into a series,
p134
aVextend it, add a little more lead.
p135
aVNow I put a bass line in.
p136
aa(lp137
VVideo: (Music)
p138
aVDM: Now I'll put some percussion in.
p139
aVVideo: (Music)
p140
aa(lp141
VDM: And now I'll attach the filter to the drums, so I can control the effect live.
p142
aa(lp143
VVideo: (Music)
p144
aa(lp145
VDM: I can speed up the whole sequence
p146
aVby tilting the tempo one way or the other.
p147
aa(lp148
VVideo: (Music)
p149
aa(lp150
VDM: And now I'll attach the filter to the bass for some more expression.
p151
aa(lp152
VVideo: (Music)
p153
aa(lp154
VDM: I can rearrange the sequence while it plays.
p155
aVSo I don't have to plan it out in advance, but I can improvise,
p156
aVmaking it longer or shorter as I go.
p157
aVAnd now, finally, I can fade the whole sequence out
p158
aVusing the volume Siftable, tilted to the left.
p159
aa(lp160
V(Applause)
p161
aVThank you.
p162
aa(lp163
VSo, as you can see,
p164
aVmy passion is for making new human-computer interfaces
p165
aVthat are a better match to the ways our brains and bodies work.
p166
aVAnd today, I had time to show you one point in this new design space,
p167
aVand a few of the possibilities that we're working to bring out of the laboratory.
p168
aVSo the thought I want to leave you with
p169
aVis that we're on the cusp of this new generation of tools
p170
aVfor interacting with digital media
p171
aVthat are going to bring information into our world
p172
aVon our terms.
p173
aVThank you very much.
p174
aVI look forward to talking with all of you.
