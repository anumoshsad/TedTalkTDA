VSteve Ramirez: My first year of grad school,
p4
aVI found myself in my bedroom
p5
aVeating lots of Ben & Jerry's
p6
aVwatching some trashy TV
p7
aVand maybe, maybe listening to Taylor Swift.
p8
aVI had just gone through a breakup.
p9
aV(Laughter)
p10
aVSo for the longest time, all I would do
p11
aVis recall the memory of this person over and over again,
p12
aVwishing that I could get rid of that gut-wrenching,
p13
aVvisceral "blah" feeling.
p14
aVNow, as it turns out, I'm a neuroscientist,
p15
aVso I knew that the memory of that person
p16
aVand the awful, emotional undertones that color in that memory,
p17
aVare largely mediated by separate brain systems.
p18
aVAnd so I thought, what if we could go into the brain
p19
aVand edit out that nauseating feeling
p20
aVbut while keeping the memory of that person intact?
p21
aVThen I realized, maybe that's a little bit lofty for now.
p22
aVSo what if we could start off by going into the brain
p23
aVand just finding a single memory to begin with?
p24
aVCould we jump-start that memory back to life,
p25
aVmaybe even play with the contents of that memory?
p26
aVAll that said, there is one person in the entire world right now
p27
aVthat I really hope is not watching this talk.
p28
aV(Laughter)
p29
aVSo there is a catch. There is a catch.
p30
aVThese ideas probably remind you of "Total Recall,"
p31
aV"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"
p32
aVor of "Inception."
p33
aVBut the movie stars that we work with
p34
aVare the celebrities of the lab.
p35
aVXu Liu: Test mice.
p36
aV(Laughter)
p37
aVAs neuroscientists, we work in the lab with mice
p38
aVtrying to understand how memory works.
p39
aVAnd today, we hope to convince you that now
p40
aVwe are actually able to activate a memory in the brain
p41
aVat the speed of light.
p42
aVTo do this, there's only two simple steps to follow.
p43
aVFirst, you find and label a memory in the brain,
p44
aVand then you activate it with a switch.
p45
aVAs simple as that.
p46
aV(Laughter)
p47
aVSR: Are you convinced?
p48
aVSo, turns out finding a memory in the brain isn't all that easy.
p49
aVXL: Indeed. This is way more difficult than, let's say,
p50
aVfinding a needle in a haystack,
p51
aVbecause at least, you know, the needle is still something
p52
aVyou can physically put your fingers on.
p53
aVBut memory is not.
p54
aVAnd also, there's way more cells in your brain
p55
aVthan the number of straws in a typical haystack.
p56
aVSo yeah, this task does seem to be daunting.
p57
aVBut luckily, we got help from the brain itself.
p58
aVIt turned out that all we need to do is basically
p59
aVto let the brain form a memory,
p60
aVand then the brain will tell us which cells are involved
p61
aVin that particular memory.
p62
aVSR: So what was going on in my brain
p63
aVwhile I was recalling the memory of an ex?
p64
aVIf you were to just completely ignore human ethics for a second
p65
aVand slice up my brain right now,
p66
aVyou would see that there was an amazing number
p67
aVof brain regions that were active while recalling that memory.
p68
aVNow one brain region that would be robustly active
p69
aVin particular is called the hippocampus,
p70
aVwhich for decades has been implicated in processing
p71
aVthe kinds of memories that we hold near and dear,
p72
aVwhich also makes it an ideal target to go into
p73
aVand to try and find and maybe reactivate a memory.
p74
aVXL: When you zoom in into the hippocampus,
p75
aVof course you will see lots of cells,
p76
aVbut we are able to find which cells are involved
p77
aVin a particular memory,
p78
aVbecause whenever a cell is active,
p79
aVlike when it's forming a memory,
p80
aVit will also leave a footprint that will later allow us to know
p81
aVthese cells are recently active.
p82
aVSR: So the same way that building lights at night
p83
aVlet you know that somebody's probably working there at any given moment,
p84
aVin a very real sense, there are biological sensors
p85
aVwithin a cell that are turned on
p86
aVonly when that cell was just working.
p87
aVThey're sort of biological windows that light up
p88
aVto let us know that that cell was just active.
p89
aVXL: So we clipped part of this sensor,
p90
aVand attached that to a switch to control the cells,
p91
aVand we packed this switch into an engineered virus
p92
aVand injected that into the brain of the mice.
p93
aVSo whenever a memory is being formed,
p94
aVany active cells for that memory
p95
aVwill also have this switch installed.
p96
aVSR: So here is what the hippocampus looks like
p97
aVafter forming a fear memory, for example.
p98
aVThe sea of blue that you see here
p99
aVare densely packed brain cells,
p100
aVbut the green brain cells,
p101
aVthe green brain cells are the ones that are holding on
p102
aVto a specific fear memory.
p103
aVSo you are looking at the crystallization
p104
aVof the fleeting formation of fear.
p105
aVYou're actually looking at the cross-section of a memory right now.
p106
aVXL: Now, for the switch we have been talking about,
p107
aVideally, the switch has to act really fast.
p108
aVIt shouldn't take minutes or hours to work.
p109
aVIt should act at the speed of the brain, in milliseconds.
p110
aVSR: So what do you think, Xu?
p111
aVCould we use, let's say, pharmacological drugs
p112
aVto activate or inactivate brain cells?
p113
aVXL: Nah. Drugs are pretty messy. They spread everywhere.
p114
aVAnd also it takes them forever to act on cells.
p115
aVSo it will not allow us to control a memory in real time.
p116
aVSo Steve, how about let's zap the brain with electricity?
p117
aVSR: So electricity is pretty fast,
p118
aVbut we probably wouldn't be able to target it
p119
aVto just the specific cells that hold onto a memory,
p120
aVand we'd probably fry the brain.
p121
aVXL: Oh. That's true. So it looks like, hmm,
p122
aVindeed we need to find a better way
p123
aVto impact the brain at the speed of light.
p124
aVSR: So it just so happens that light travels at the speed of light.
p125
aVSo maybe we could activate or inactive memories
p126
aVby just using light \u2014
p127
aVXL: That's pretty fast.
p128
aVSR: \u2014 and because normally brain cells
p129
aVdon't respond to pulses of light,
p130
aVso those that would respond to pulses of light
p131
aVare those that contain a light-sensitive switch.
p132
aVNow to do that, first we need to trick brain cells
p133
aVto respond to laser beams.
p134
aVXL: Yep. You heard it right.
p135
aVWe are trying to shoot lasers into the brain.
p136
aV(Laughter)
p137
aVSR: And the technique that lets us do that is optogenetics.
p138
aVOptogenetics gave us this light switch that we can use
p139
aVto turn brain cells on or off,
p140
aVand the name of that switch is channelrhodopsin,
p141
aVseen here as these green dots attached to this brain cell.
p142
aVYou can think of channelrhodopsin as a sort of light-sensitive switch
p143
aVthat can be artificially installed in brain cells
p144
aVso that now we can use that switch
p145
aVto activate or inactivate the brain cell simply by clicking it,
p146
aVand in this case we click it on with pulses of light.
p147
aVXL: So we attach this light-sensitive switch of channelrhodopsin
p148
aVto the sensor we've been talking about
p149
aVand inject this into the brain.
p150
aVSo whenever a memory is being formed,
p151
aVany active cell for that particular memory
p152
aVwill also have this light-sensitive switch installed in it
p153
aVso that we can control these cells
p154
aVby the flipping of a laser just like this one you see.
p155
aVSR: So let's put all of this to the test now.
p156
aVWhat we can do is we can take our mice
p157
aVand then we can put them in a box that looks exactly like this box here,
p158
aVand then we can give them a very mild foot shock
p159
aVso that they form a fear memory of this box.
p160
aVThey learn that something bad happened here.
p161
aVNow with our system, the cells that are active
p162
aVin the hippocampus in the making of this memory,
p163
aVonly those cells will now contain channelrhodopsin.
p164
aVXL: When you are as small as a mouse,
p165
aVit feels as if the whole world is trying to get you.
p166
aVSo your best response of defense
p167
aVis trying to be undetected.
p168
aVWhenever a mouse is in fear,
p169
aVit will show this very typical behavior
p170
aVby staying at one corner of the box,
p171
aVtrying to not move any part of its body,
p172
aVand this posture is called freezing.
p173
aVSo if a mouse remembers that something bad happened in this box,
p174
aVand when we put them back into the same box,
p175
aVit will basically show freezing
p176
aVbecause it doesn't want to be detected
p177
aVby any potential threats in this box.
p178
aVSR: So you can think of freezing as,
p179
aVyou're walking down the street minding your own business,
p180
aVand then out of nowhere you almost run into
p181
aVan ex-girlfriend or ex-boyfriend,
p182
aVand now those terrifying two seconds
p183
aVwhere you start thinking, "What do I do? Do I say hi?
p184
aVDo I shake their hand? Do I turn around and run away?
p185
aVDo I sit here and pretend like I don't exist?"
p186
aVThose kinds of fleeting thoughts that physically incapacitate you,
p187
aVthat temporarily give you that deer-in-headlights look.
p188
aVXL: However, if you put the mouse in a completely different
p189
aVnew box, like the next one,
p190
aVit will not be afraid of this box
p191
aVbecause there's no reason that it will be afraid of this new environment.
p192
aVBut what if we put the mouse in this new box
p193
aVbut at the same time, we activate the fear memory
p194
aVusing lasers just like we did before?
p195
aVAre we going to bring back the fear memory
p196
aVfor the first box into this completely new environment?
p197
aVSR: All right, and here's the million-dollar experiment.
p198
aVNow to bring back to life the memory of that day,
p199
aVI remember that the Red Sox had just won,
p200
aVit was a green spring day,
p201
aVperfect for going up and down the river
p202
aVand then maybe going to the North End
p203
aVto get some cannolis, #justsaying.
p204
aVNow Xu and I, on the other hand,
p205
aVwere in a completely windowless black room
p206
aVnot making any ocular movement that even remotely resembles an eye blink
p207
aVbecause our eyes were fixed onto a computer screen.
p208
aVWe were looking at this mouse here trying to activate a memory
p209
aVfor the first time using our technique.
p210
aVXL: And this is what we saw.
p211
aVWhen we first put the mouse into this box,
p212
aVit's exploring, sniffing around, walking around,
p213
aVminding its own business,
p214
aVbecause actually by nature,
p215
aVmice are pretty curious animals.
p216
aVThey want to know, what's going on in this new box?
p217
aVIt's interesting.
p218
aVBut the moment we turned on the laser, like you see now,
p219
aVall of a sudden the mouse entered this freezing mode.
p220
aVIt stayed here and tried not to move any part of its body.
p221
aVClearly it's freezing.
p222
aVSo indeed, it looks like we are able to bring back
p223
aVthe fear memory for the first box
p224
aVin this completely new environment.
p225
aVWhile watching this, Steve and I
p226
aVare as shocked as the mouse itself.
p227
aV(Laughter)
p228
aVSo after the experiment, the two of us just left the room
p229
aVwithout saying anything.
p230
aVAfter a kind of long, awkward period of time,
p231
aVSteve broke the silence.
p232
aVSR: "Did that just work?"
p233
aVXL: "Yes," I said. "Indeed it worked!"
p234
aVWe're really excited about this.
p235
aVAnd then we published our findings
p236
aVin the journal Nature.
p237
aVEver since the publication of our work,
p238
aVwe've been receiving numerous comments
p239
aVfrom all over the Internet.
p240
aVMaybe we can take a look at some of those.
p241
aV["OMGGGGG FINALLY... so much more to come, virtual reality, neural manipulation, visual dream emulation... neural coding, 'writing and re-writing of memories', mental illnesses. Ahhh the future is awesome"]
p242
aVSR: So the first thing that you'll notice is that people
p243
aVhave really strong opinions about this kind of work.
p244
aVNow I happen to completely agree with the optimism
p245
aVof this first quote,
p246
aVbecause on a scale of zero to Morgan Freeman's voice,
p247
aVit happens to be one of the most evocative accolades
p248
aVthat I've heard come our way.
p249
aV(Laughter)
p250
aVBut as you'll see, it's not the only opinion that's out there.
p251
aV["This scares the hell out of me... What if they could do that easily in humans in a couple of years?! OH MY GOD WE'RE DOOMED"]
p252
aVXL: Indeed, if we take a look at the second one,
p253
aVI think we can all agree that it's, meh,
p254
aVprobably not as positive.
p255
aVBut this also reminds us that,
p256
aValthough we are still working with mice,
p257
aVit's probably a good idea to start thinking and discussing
p258
aVabout the possible ethical ramifications
p259
aVof memory control.
p260
aVSR: Now, in the spirit of the third quote,
p261
aVwe want to tell you about a recent project that we've been
p262
aVworking on in lab that we've called Project Inception.
p263
aV["They should make a movie about this. Where they plant ideas into peoples minds, so they can control them for their own personal gain. We'll call it: Inception."]
p264
aVSo we reasoned that now that we can reactivate a memory,
p265
aVwhat if we do so but then begin to tinker with that memory?
p266
aVCould we possibly even turn it into a false memory?
p267
aVXL: So all memory is sophisticated and dynamic,
p268
aVbut if just for simplicity, let's imagine memory
p269
aVas a movie clip.
p270
aVSo far what we've told you is basically we can control
p271
aVthis "play" button of the clip
p272
aVso that we can play this video clip any time, anywhere.
p273
aVBut is there a possibility that we can actually get
p274
aVinside the brain and edit this movie clip
p275
aVso that we can make it different from the original?
p276
aVYes we can.
p277
aVTurned out that all we need to do is basically
p278
aVreactivate a memory using lasers just like we did before,
p279
aVbut at the same time, if we present new information
p280
aVand allow this new information to incorporate into this old memory,
p281
aVthis will change the memory.
p282
aVIt's sort of like making a remix tape.
p283
aVSR: So how do we do this?
p284
aVRather than finding a fear memory in the brain,
p285
aVwe can start by taking our animals,
p286
aVand let's say we put them in a blue box like this blue box here
p287
aVand we find the brain cells that represent that blue box
p288
aVand we trick them to respond to pulses of light
p289
aVexactly like we had said before.
p290
aVNow the next day, we can take our animals and place them
p291
aVin a red box that they've never experienced before.
p292
aVWe can shoot light into the brain to reactivate
p293
aVthe memory of the blue box.
p294
aVSo what would happen here if, while the animal
p295
aVis recalling the memory of the blue box,
p296
aVwe gave it a couple of mild foot shocks?
p297
aVSo here we're trying to artificially make an association
p298
aVbetween the memory of the blue box
p299
aVand the foot shocks themselves.
p300
aVWe're just trying to connect the two.
p301
aVSo to test if we had done so,
p302
aVwe can take our animals once again
p303
aVand place them back in the blue box.
p304
aVAgain, we had just reactivated the memory of the blue box
p305
aVwhile the animal got a couple of mild foot shocks,
p306
aVand now the animal suddenly freezes.
p307
aVIt's as though it's recalling being mildly shocked in this environment
p308
aVeven though that never actually happened.
p309
aVSo it formed a false memory,
p310
aVbecause it's falsely fearing an environment
p311
aVwhere, technically speaking,
p312
aVnothing bad actually happened to it.
p313
aVXL: So, so far we are only talking about
p314
aVthis light-controlled "on" switch.
p315
aVIn fact, we also have a light-controlled "off" switch,
p316
aVand it's very easy to imagine that
p317
aVby installing this light-controlled "off" switch,
p318
aVwe can also turn off a memory, any time, anywhere.
p319
aVSo everything we've been talking about today
p320
aVis based on this philosophically charged principle of neuroscience
p321
aVthat the mind, with its seemingly mysterious properties,
p322
aVis actually made of physical stuff that we can tinker with.
p323
aVSR: And for me personally,
p324
aVI see a world where we can reactivate
p325
aVany kind of memory that we'd like.
p326
aVI also see a world where we can erase unwanted memories.
p327
aVNow, I even see a world where editing memories
p328
aVis something of a reality,
p329
aVbecause we're living in a time where it's possible
p330
aVto pluck questions from the tree of science fiction
p331
aVand to ground them in experimental reality.
p332
aVXL: Nowadays, people in the lab
p333
aVand people in other groups all over the world
p334
aVare using similar methods to activate or edit memories,
p335
aVwhether that's old or new, positive or negative,
p336
aVall sorts of memories so that we can understand
p337
aVhow memory works.
p338
aVSR: For example, one group in our lab
p339
aVwas able to find the brain cells that make up a fear memory
p340
aVand converted them into a pleasurable memory, just like that.
p341
aVThat's exactly what I mean about editing these kinds of processes.
p342
aVNow one dude in lab was even able to reactivate
p343
aVmemories of female mice in male mice,
p344
aVwhich rumor has it is a pleasurable experience.
p345
aVXL: Indeed, we are living in a very exciting moment
p346
aVwhere science doesn't have any arbitrary speed limits
p347
aVbut is only bound by our own imagination.
p348
aVSR: And finally, what do we make of all this?
p349
aVHow do we push this technology forward?
p350
aVThese are the questions that should not remain
p351
aVjust inside the lab,
p352
aVand so one goal of today's talk was to bring everybody
p353
aVup to speed with the kind of stuff that's possible
p354
aVin modern neuroscience,
p355
aVbut now, just as importantly,
p356
aVto actively engage everybody in this conversation.
p357
aVSo let's think together as a team about what this all means
p358
aVand where we can and should go from here,
p359
aVbecause Xu and I think we all have
p360
aVsome really big decisions ahead of us.
p361
aVThank you. XL: Thank you.
