VWe're here today to announce
p4
aVthe first synthetic cell,
p5
aVa cell made by
p6
aVstarting with the digital code in the computer,
p7
aVbuilding the chromosome
p8
aVfrom four bottles of chemicals,
p9
aVassembling that chromosome in yeast,
p10
aVtransplanting it into
p11
aVa recipient bacterial cell
p12
aVand transforming that cell
p13
aVinto a new bacterial species.
p14
aVSo this is the first self-replicating species
p15
aVthat we've had on the planet
p16
aVwhose parent is a computer.
p17
aVIt also is the first species
p18
aVto have its own website
p19
aVencoded in its genetic code.
p20
aVBut we'll talk more about
p21
aVthe watermarks in a minute.
p22
aa(lp23
VThis is a project that had its inception
p24
aV15 years ago
p25
aVwhen our team then \u2014
p26
aVwe called the institute TIGR \u2014
p27
aVwas involved in sequencing
p28
aVthe first two genomes in history.
p29
aVWe did Haemophilus influenzae
p30
aVand then the smallest genome of a self-replicating organism,
p31
aVthat of Mycoplasma genitalium.
p32
aVAnd as soon as
p33
aVwe had these two sequences
p34
aVwe thought, if this is supposed to be the smallest genome
p35
aVof a self-replicating species,
p36
aVcould there be even a smaller genome?
p37
aVCould we understand the basis of cellular life
p38
aVat the genetic level?
p39
aVIt's been a 15-year quest
p40
aVjust to get to the starting point now
p41
aVto be able to answer those questions,
p42
aVbecause it's very difficult to eliminate
p43
aVmultiple genes from a cell.
p44
aVYou can only do them one at a time.
p45
aVWe decided early on
p46
aVthat we had to take a synthetic route,
p47
aVeven though nobody had been there before,
p48
aVto see if we could synthesize
p49
aVa bacterial chromosome
p50
aVso we could actually vary the gene content
p51
aVto understand the essential genes for life.
p52
aVThat started our 15-year quest
p53
aVto get here.
p54
aa(lp55
VBut before we did the first experiments,
p56
aVwe actually asked
p57
aVArt Caplan's team at the University of Pennsylvania
p58
aVto undertake a review
p59
aVof what the risks, the challenges,
p60
aVthe ethics around creating new
p61
aVspecies in the laboratory were
p62
aVbecause it hadn't been done before.
p63
aVThey spent about two years
p64
aVreviewing that independently
p65
aVand published their results in Science in 1999.
p66
aVHam and I took two years off
p67
aVas a side project to sequence the human genome,
p68
aVbut as soon as that was done
p69
aVwe got back to the task at hand.
p70
aa(lp71
VIn 2002, we started
p72
aVa new institute,
p73
aVthe Institute for Biological Energy Alternatives,
p74
aVwhere we set out two goals:
p75
aVOne, to understand
p76
aVthe impact of our technology on the environment,
p77
aVand how to understand the environment better,
p78
aVand two, to start down this process
p79
aVof making synthetic life
p80
aVto understand basic life.
p81
aVIn 2003,
p82
aVwe published our first success.
p83
aVSo Ham Smith and Clyde Hutchison
p84
aVdeveloped some new methods
p85
aVfor making error-free DNA
p86
aVat a small level.
p87
aVOur first task was
p88
aVa 5,000-letter code bacteriophage,
p89
aVa virus that attacks only E. coli.
p90
aVSo that was
p91
aVthe phage phi X 174,
p92
aVwhich was chosen for historical reasons.
p93
aVIt was the first DNA phage,
p94
aVDNA virus, DNA genome
p95
aVthat was actually sequenced.
p96
aVSo once we realized
p97
aVthat we could make 5,000-base pair
p98
aVviral-sized pieces,
p99
aVwe thought, we at least have the means
p100
aVthen to try and make serially lots of these pieces
p101
aVto be able to eventually assemble them together
p102
aVto make this mega base chromosome.
p103
aVSo, substantially larger than
p104
aVwe even thought we would go initially.
p105
aa(lp106
VThere were several steps to this. There were two sides:
p107
aVWe had to solve the chemistry
p108
aVfor making large DNA molecules,
p109
aVand we had to solve the biological side
p110
aVof how, if we had this new chemical entity,
p111
aVhow would we boot it up, activate it
p112
aVin a recipient cell.
p113
aVWe had two teams working in parallel:
p114
aVone team on the chemistry,
p115
aVand the other on trying to
p116
aVbe able to transplant
p117
aVentire chromosomes
p118
aVto get new cells.
p119
aVWhen we started this out, we thought the synthesis would be the biggest problem,
p120
aVwhich is why we chose the smallest genome.
p121
aa(lp122
VAnd some of you have noticed that we switched from the smallest genome
p123
aVto a much larger one.
p124
aVAnd we can walk through the reasons for that,
p125
aVbut basically the small cell
p126
aVtook on the order of
p127
aVone to two months to get results from,
p128
aVwhereas the larger, faster-growing cell
p129
aVtakes only two days.
p130
aVSo there's only so many cycles we could go through
p131
aVin a year at six weeks per cycle.
p132
aVAnd you should know that basically
p133
aV99, probably 99 percent plus
p134
aVof our experiments failed.
p135
aVSo this was a debugging,
p136
aVproblem-solving scenario from the beginning
p137
aVbecause there was no recipe
p138
aVof how to get there.
p139
aa(lp140
VSo, one of the most important publications we had
p141
aVwas in 2007.
p142
aVCarole Lartigue led the effort
p143
aVto actually transplant a bacterial chromosome
p144
aVfrom one bacteria to another.
p145
aVI think philosophically, that was one of the most important papers
p146
aVthat we've ever done
p147
aVbecause it showed how dynamic life was.
p148
aVAnd we knew, once that worked,
p149
aVthat we actually had a chance
p150
aVif we could make the synthetic chromosomes
p151
aVto do the same with those.
p152
aVWe didn't know that it was going to take us
p153
aVseveral years more to get there.
p154
aa(lp155
VIn 2008,
p156
aVwe reported the complete synthesis
p157
aVof the Mycoplasma genitalium genome,
p158
aVa little over 500,000 letters of genetic code,
p159
aVbut we have not yet succeeded in booting up that chromosome.
p160
aVWe think in part, because of its slow growth
p161
aVand, in part,
p162
aVcells have all kinds of unique defense mechanisms
p163
aVto keep these events from happening.
p164
aVIt turned out the cell that we were trying to transplant into
p165
aVhad a nuclease, an enzyme that chews up DNA on its surface,
p166
aVand was happy to eat
p167
aVthe synthetic DNA that we gave it
p168
aVand never got transplantations.
p169
aVBut at the time, that was the largest
p170
aVmolecule of a defined structure
p171
aVthat had been made.
p172
aa(lp173
VAnd so both sides were progressing,
p174
aVbut part of the synthesis
p175
aVhad to be accomplished or was able to be accomplished
p176
aVusing yeast, putting the fragments in yeast
p177
aVand yeast would assemble these for us.
p178
aVIt's an amazing step forward,
p179
aVbut we had a problem because now we had
p180
aVthe bacterial chromosomes growing in yeast.
p181
aVSo in addition to doing the transplant,
p182
aVwe had to find out how to get a bacterial chromosome
p183
aVout of the eukaryotic yeast
p184
aVinto a form where we could transplant it
p185
aVinto a recipient cell.
p186
aa(lp187
VSo our team developed new techniques
p188
aVfor actually growing, cloning
p189
aVentire bacterial chromosomes in yeast.
p190
aVSo we took the same mycoides genome
p191
aVthat Carole had initially transplanted,
p192
aVand we grew that in yeast
p193
aVas an artificial chromosome.
p194
aVAnd we thought this would be a great test bed
p195
aVfor learning how to get chromosomes out of yeast
p196
aVand transplant them.
p197
aVWhen we did these experiments, though,
p198
aVwe could get the chromosome out of yeast
p199
aVbut it wouldn't transplant and boot up a cell.
p200
aVThat little issue took the team two years to solve.
p201
aa(lp202
VIt turns out, the DNA in the bacterial cell
p203
aVwas actually methylated,
p204
aVand the methylation protects it from the restriction enzyme,
p205
aVfrom digesting the DNA.
p206
aVSo what we found is if we took the chromosome
p207
aVout of yeast and methylated it,
p208
aVwe could then transplant it.
p209
aVFurther advances came
p210
aVwhen the team removed the restriction enzyme genes
p211
aVfrom the recipient capricolum cell.
p212
aVAnd once we had done that, now we can take
p213
aVnaked DNA out of yeast and transplant it.
p214
aa(lp215
VSo last fall
p216
aVwhen we published the results of that work in Science,
p217
aVwe all became overconfident
p218
aVand were sure we were only
p219
aVa few weeks away
p220
aVfrom being able to now boot up
p221
aVa chromosome out of yeast.
p222
aVBecause of the problems with
p223
aVMycoplasma genitalium and its slow growth
p224
aVabout a year and a half ago,
p225
aVwe decided to synthesize
p226
aVthe much larger chromosome, the mycoides chromosome,
p227
aVknowing that we had the biology worked out on that
p228
aVfor transplantation.
p229
aVAnd Dan led the team for the synthesis
p230
aVof this over one-million-base pair chromosome.
p231
aVBut it turned out it wasn't going to be as simple in the end,
p232
aVand it set us back three months
p233
aVbecause we had one error
p234
aVout of over a million base pairs in that sequence.
p235
aa(lp236
VSo the team developed new debugging software,
p237
aVwhere we could test each synthetic fragment
p238
aVto see if it would grow in a background
p239
aVof wild type DNA.
p240
aVAnd we found that 10 out of the 11
p241
aV100,000-base pair pieces we synthesized
p242
aVwere completely accurate
p243
aVand compatible with
p244
aVa life-forming sequence.
p245
aVWe narrowed it down to one fragment;
p246
aVwe sequenced it
p247
aVand found just one base pair had been deleted
p248
aVin an essential gene.
p249
aVSo accuracy is essential.
p250
aVThere's parts of the genome
p251
aVwhere it cannot tolerate even a single error,
p252
aVand then there's parts of the genome
p253
aVwhere we can put in large blocks of DNA,
p254
aVas we did with the watermarks,
p255
aVand it can tolerate all kinds of errors.
p256
aVSo it took about three months to find that error
p257
aVand repair it.
p258
aVAnd then early one morning, at 6 a.m.
p259
aVwe got a text from Dan
p260
aVsaying that, now, the first blue colonies existed.
p261
aa(lp262
VSo, it's been a long route to get here:
p263
aV15 years from the beginning.
p264
aVWe felt
p265
aVone of the tenets of this field
p266
aVwas to make absolutely certain
p267
aVwe could distinguish synthetic DNA
p268
aVfrom natural DNA.
p269
aVEarly on, when you're working in a new area of science,
p270
aVyou have to think about all the pitfalls
p271
aVand things that could lead you
p272
aVto believe that you had done something when you hadn't,
p273
aVand, even worse, leading others to believe it.
p274
aVSo, we thought the worst problem would be
p275
aVa single molecule contamination
p276
aVof the native chromosome,
p277
aVleading us to believe that we actually had
p278
aVcreated a synthetic cell,
p279
aVwhen it would have been just a contaminant.
p280
aa(lp281
VSo early on, we developed the notion
p282
aVof putting in watermarks in the DNA
p283
aVto absolutely make clear
p284
aVthat the DNA was synthetic.
p285
aVAnd the first chromosome we built
p286
aVin 2008 \u2014
p287
aVthe 500,000-base pair one \u2014
p288
aVwe simply assigned
p289
aVthe names of the authors of the chromosome
p290
aVinto the genetic code,
p291
aVbut it was using just amino acid
p292
aVsingle letter translations,
p293
aVwhich leaves out certain letters of the alphabet.
p294
aVSo the team actually developed a new code
p295
aVwithin the code within the code.
p296
aVSo it's a new code
p297
aVfor interpreting and writing messages in DNA.
p298
aVNow, mathematicians have been hiding and writing
p299
aVmessages in the genetic code for a long time,
p300
aVbut it's clear they were mathematicians and not biologists
p301
aVbecause, if you write long messages
p302
aVwith the code that the mathematicians developed,
p303
aVit would more than likely lead to
p304
aVnew proteins being synthesized
p305
aVwith unknown functions.
p306
aa(lp307
VSo the code that Mike Montague and the team developed
p308
aVactually puts frequent stop codons,
p309
aVso it's a different alphabet
p310
aVbut allows us to use
p311
aVthe entire English alphabet
p312
aVwith punctuation and numbers.
p313
aVSo, there are four major watermarks
p314
aVall over 1,000 base pairs of genetic code.
p315
aVThe first one actually contains within it
p316
aVthis code for interpreting
p317
aVthe rest of the genetic code.
p318
aVSo in the remaining information,
p319
aVin the watermarks,
p320
aVcontain the names of, I think it's
p321
aV46 different authors
p322
aVand key contributors
p323
aVto getting the project to this stage.
p324
aVAnd we also built in
p325
aVa website address
p326
aVso that if somebody decodes the code
p327
aVwithin the code within the code,
p328
aVthey can send an email to that address.
p329
aVSo it's clearly distinguishable
p330
aVfrom any other species,
p331
aVhaving 46 names in it,
p332
aVits own web address.
p333
aVAnd we added three quotations,
p334
aVbecause with the first genome
p335
aVwe were criticized for not trying to say something more profound
p336
aVthan just signing the work.
p337
aa(lp338
VSo we won't give the rest of the code,
p339
aVbut we will give the three quotations.
p340
aVThe first is,
p341
aV"To live, to err,
p342
aVto fall, to triumph
p343
aVand to recreate life out of life."
p344
aVIt's a James Joyce quote.
p345
aVThe second quotation is, "See things not as they are,
p346
aVbut as they might be."
p347
aVIt's a quote from the "American Prometheus"
p348
aVbook on Robert Oppenheimer.
p349
aVAnd the last one is a Richard Feynman quote:
p350
aV"What I cannot build,
p351
aVI cannot understand."
p352
aVSo, because this is as much a philosophical advance
p353
aVas a technical advance in science,
p354
aVwe tried to deal with both the philosophical
p355
aVand the technical side.
p356
aa(lp357
VThe last thing I want to say before turning it over to questions
p358
aVis that the extensive work
p359
aVthat we've done \u2014
p360
aVasking for ethical review,
p361
aVpushing the envelope
p362
aVon that side as well as the technical side \u2014
p363
aVthis has been broadly discussed in the scientific community,
p364
aVin the policy community
p365
aVand at the highest levels of the federal government.
p366
aVEven with this announcement,
p367
aVas we did in 2003 \u2014
p368
aVthat work was funded by the Department of Energy,
p369
aVso the work was reviewed
p370
aVat the level of the White House,
p371
aVtrying to decide whether to classify the work or publish it.
p372
aVAnd they came down on the side of open publication,
p373
aVwhich is the right approach \u2014
p374
aVwe've briefed the White House,
p375
aVwe've briefed members of Congress,
p376
aVwe've tried to take and push
p377
aVthe policy issues
p378
aVin parallel with the scientific advances.
p379
aa(lp380
VSo with that, I would like
p381
aVto open it first to the floor for questions.
p382
aVYes, in the back.
p383
aa(lp384
VReporter: Could you explain, in layman's terms,
p385
aVhow significant a breakthrough this is please?
p386
aa(lp387
VCraig Venter: Can we explain how significant this is?
p388
aVI'm not sure we're the ones that should be explaining how significant it is.
p389
aVIt's significant to us.
p390
aVPerhaps it's a giant philosophical change
p391
aVin how we view life.
p392
aVWe actually view it as a baby step in terms of,
p393
aVit's taken us 15 years to be able
p394
aVto do the experiment
p395
aVwe wanted to do 15 years ago
p396
aVon understanding life at its basic level.
p397
aVBut we actually believe
p398
aVthis is going to be a very powerful set of tools
p399
aVand we're already starting
p400
aVin numerous avenues
p401
aVto use this tool.
p402
aa(lp403
VWe have, at the Institute,
p404
aVongoing funding now from NIH
p405
aVin a program with Novartis
p406
aVto try and use these new
p407
aVsynthetic DNA tools
p408
aVto perhaps make the flu vaccine
p409
aVthat you might get next year.
p410
aVBecause instead of taking weeks to months to make these,
p411
aVDan's team can now make these
p412
aVin less than 24 hours.
p413
aVSo when you see how long it took to get an H1N1 vaccine out,
p414
aVwe think we can shorten that process
p415
aVquite substantially.
p416
aVIn the vaccine area,
p417
aVSynthetic Genomics and the Institute
p418
aVare forming a new vaccine company
p419
aVbecause we think these tools can affect vaccines
p420
aVto diseases that haven't been possible to date,
p421
aVthings where the viruses rapidly evolve,
p422
aVsuch with rhinovirus.
p423
aVWouldn't it be nice to have something that actually blocked common colds?
p424
aVOr, more importantly, HIV,
p425
aVwhere the virus evolves so quickly
p426
aVthe vaccines that are made today
p427
aVcan't keep up
p428
aVwith those evolutionary changes.
p429
aa(lp430
VAlso, at Synthetic Genomics,
p431
aVwe've been working
p432
aVon major environmental issues.
p433
aVI think this latest oil spill in the Gulf
p434
aVis a reminder.
p435
aVWe can't see CO2 \u2014
p436
aVwe depend on scientific measurements for it
p437
aVand we see the beginning results
p438
aVof having too much of it \u2014
p439
aVbut we can see pre-CO2 now
p440
aVfloating on the waters
p441
aVand contaminating the beaches in the Gulf.
p442
aVWe need some alternatives
p443
aVfor oil.
p444
aVWe have a program with Exxon Mobile
p445
aVto try and develop new strains of algae
p446
aVthat can efficiently capture carbon dioxide
p447
aVfrom the atmosphere or from concentrated sources,
p448
aVmake new hydrocarbons that can go into their refineries
p449
aVto make normal gasoline
p450
aVand diesel fuel out of CO2.
p451
aa(lp452
VThose are just a couple of the approaches
p453
aVand directions that we're taking.
