VWhen we use the word "architect" or "designer,"
p4
aVwhat we usually mean is a professional,
p5
aVsomeone who gets paid,
p6
aVand we tend to assume that it's those professionals
p7
aVwho are going to be the ones to help us solve
p8
aVthe really big, systemic design challenges that we face
p9
aVlike climate change, urbanization and social inequality.
p10
aVThat's our kind of working presumption.
p11
aVAnd I think it's wrong, actually.
p12
aa(lp13
VIn 2008, I was just about to graduate from architecture school
p14
aVafter several years, and go out and get a job,
p15
aVand this happened.
p16
aVThe economy ran out of jobs.
p17
aVAnd a couple of things struck me about this.
p18
aVOne, don't listen to career advisers.
p19
aVAnd two, actually this is a fascinating paradox for architecture,
p20
aVwhich is that, as a society, we've never needed design thinking more,
p21
aVand yet architecture was literally becoming unemployed.
p22
aVIt strikes me that we talk very deeply about design,
p23
aVbut actually there's an economics behind architecture
p24
aVthat we don't talk about, and I think we need to.
p25
aa(lp26
VAnd a good place to start is your own paycheck.
p27
aVSo, as a bottom-of-the-rung architecture graduate,
p28
aVI might expect to earn about 24,000 pounds.
p29
aVThat's about 36,000, 37,000 dollars.
p30
aVNow in terms of the whole world's population,
p31
aVthat already puts me in the top 1.95 richest people,
p32
aVwhich raises the question of, who is it I'm working for?
p33
aVThe uncomfortable fact is that
p34
aVactually almost everything that we call architecture today
p35
aVis actually the business of designing
p36
aVfor about the richest one percent of the world's population,
p37
aVand it always has been.
p38
aVThe reason why we forgot that
p39
aVis because the times in history when architecture
p40
aVdid the most to transform society were those times
p41
aVwhen, actually, the one percent would build
p42
aVon behalf of the 99 percent, for various different reasons,
p43
aVwhether that was through philanthropy in the 19th century,
p44
aVcommunism in the early 20th,
p45
aVthe welfare state, and most recently, of course,
p46
aVthrough this inflated real estate bubble.
p47
aVAnd all of those booms, in their own various ways,
p48
aVhave now kicked the bucket,
p49
aVand we're back in this situation
p50
aVwhere the smartest designers and architects in the world
p51
aVare only really able to work for one percent of the population.
p52
aa(lp53
VNow it's not just that that's bad for democracy,
p54
aVthough I think it probably is,
p55
aVit's actually not a very clever business strategy, actually.
p56
aVI think the challenge facing the next generation of architects
p57
aVis, how are we going to turn our client
p58
aVfrom the one percent to the 100 percent?
p59
aVAnd I want to offer three slightly counterintuitive ideas
p60
aVfor how it might be done.
p61
aa(lp62
VThe first is, I think we need to question this idea
p63
aVthat architecture is about making buildings.
p64
aVActually, a building is about the most expensive solution
p65
aVyou can think of to almost any given problem.
p66
aVAnd fundamentally, design should be much, much more interested
p67
aVin solving problems and creating new conditions.
p68
aVSo here's a story.
p69
aVThe office was working with a school,
p70
aVand they had an old Victorian school building.
p71
aa(lp72
VAnd they said to the architects, "Look,
p73
aVour corridors are an absolute nightmare.
p74
aVThey're far too small. They get congested between classes.
p75
aVThere's bullying. We can't control them.
p76
aVSo what we want you to do is re-plan our entire building,
p77
aVand we know it's going to cost several million pounds,
p78
aVbut we're reconciled to the fact."
p79
aa(lp80
VAnd the team thought about this, and they went away,
p81
aVand they said, "Actually, don't do that.
p82
aVInstead, get rid of the school bell.
p83
aVAnd instead of having one school bell that goes off once,
p84
aVhave several smaller school bells that go off
p85
aVin different places and different times,
p86
aVdistribute the traffic through the corridors."
p87
aVIt solves the same problem,
p88
aVbut instead of spending several million pounds,
p89
aVyou spend several hundred pounds.
p90
aVNow, it looks like you're doing yourself out of a job,
p91
aVbut you're not. You're actually making yourself more useful.
p92
aVArchitects are actually really, really good
p93
aVat this kind of resourceful, strategic thinking.
p94
aVAnd the problem is that, like a lot of design professions,
p95
aVwe got fixated on the idea of providing
p96
aVa particular kind of consumer product,
p97
aVand I don't think that needs to be the case anymore.
p98
aa(lp99
VThe second idea worth questioning is this 20th-century thing
p100
aVthat mass architecture is about big \u2014
p101
aVbig buildings and big finance.
p102
aVActually, we've got ourselves locked into this
p103
aVIndustrial Era mindset which says that
p104
aVthe only people who can make cities are large organizations
p105
aVor corporations who build on our behalf,
p106
aVprocuring whole neighborhoods
p107
aVin single, monolithic projects, and of course,
p108
aVform follows finance.
p109
aVSo what you end up with are single, monolithic neighborhoods
p110
aVbased on this kind of one-size-fits-all model.
p111
aVAnd a lot of people can't even afford them.
p112
aVBut what if, actually, it's possible now for cities
p113
aVto be made not just by the few with a lot
p114
aVbut also by the many with a bit?
p115
aVAnd when they do, they bring with them
p116
aVa completely different set of values about the place that they want to live.
p117
aVAnd it raises really interesting questions about,
p118
aVhow will we plan cities? How will finance development?
p119
aVHow will we sell design services?
p120
aVWhat would it mean for democratic societies
p121
aVto offer their citizens a right to build?
p122
aVAnd in a way it should be kind of obvious, right,
p123
aVthat in the 21st century, maybe cities can be developed by citizens.
p124
aa(lp125
VAnd thirdly, we need to remember that,
p126
aVfrom a strictly economic point of view,
p127
aVdesign shares a category with sex and care of the elderly \u2014
p128
aVmostly it's done by amateurs.
p129
aVAnd that's a good thing.
p130
aVMost of the work takes place outside of the monetary economy
p131
aVin what's called the social economy or the core economy,
p132
aVwhich is people doing it for themselves.
p133
aVAnd the problem is that, up until now,
p134
aVit was the monetary economy which had
p135
aVall the infrastructure and all the tools.
p136
aa(lp137
VSo the challenge we face is, how are we going
p138
aVto build the tools, the infrastructure and the institutions
p139
aVfor architecture's social economy?
p140
aVAnd that began with open-source software.
p141
aVAnd over the last few years, it's been moving
p142
aVinto the physical world with open-source hardware,
p143
aVwhich are freely shared blueprints
p144
aVthat anyone can download and make for themselves.
p145
aVAnd that's where 3D printing gets really, really interesting.
p146
aVRight? When suddenly you had a 3D printer
p147
aVthat was open-source, the parts for which
p148
aVcould be made on another 3D printer.
p149
aVOr the same idea here, which is for a CNC machine,
p150
aVwhich is like a large printer that can cut sheets of plywood.
p151
aVWhat these technologies are doing is radically
p152
aVlowering the thresholds of time and cost and skill.
p153
aVThey're challenging the idea that
p154
aVif you want something to be affordable it's got to be one-size-fits-all.
p155
aVAnd they're distributing massively
p156
aVreally complex manufacturing capabilities.
p157
aVWe're moving into this future where the factory is everywhere,
p158
aVand increasingly that means
p159
aVthat the design team is everyone.
p160
aVThat really is an industrial revolution.
p161
aVAnd when we think that the major ideological conflicts
p162
aVthat we inherited were all based around this question
p163
aVof who should control the means of production,
p164
aVand these technologies are coming back with a solution:
p165
aVactually, maybe no one. All of us.
p166
aa(lp167
VAnd we were fascinated by
p168
aVwhat that might mean for architecture.
p169
aVSo about a year and a half ago,
p170
aVwe started working on a project called WikiHouse,
p171
aVand WikiHouse is an open-source construction system.
p172
aVAnd the idea is to make it possible for anyone
p173
aVto go online, access a freely shared library
p174
aVof 3D models which they can download and adapt in,
p175
aVat the moment, SketchUp, because it's free, and it's easy to use,
p176
aVand almost at the click of a switch
p177
aVthey can generate a set of cutting files
p178
aVwhich allow them, in effect,
p179
aVto print out the parts from a house using a CNC machine
p180
aVand a standard sheet material like plywood.
p181
aVAnd the parts are all numbered,
p182
aVand basically what you end up with is a really big IKEA kit.
p183
aV(Laughter)
p184
aVAnd it goes together without any bolts.
p185
aVIt uses wedge and peg connections.
p186
aVAnd even the mallets to make it
p187
aVcan be provided on the cutting sheets as well.
p188
aVAnd a team of about two or three people,
p189
aVworking together, can build this.
p190
aVThey don't need any traditional construction skills.
p191
aVThey don't need a huge array of power tools or anything like that,
p192
aVand they can build a small house of about this size
p193
aVin about a day.
p194
aa(lp195
V(Applause)
p196
aa(lp197
VAnd what you end up with is just the basic chassis of a house
p198
aVonto which you can then apply systems like windows
p199
aVand cladding and insulation and services
p200
aVbased on what's cheap and what's available.
p201
aVOf course, the house is never finished.
p202
aVWe're shifting our heads here, so the house is not a finished product.
p203
aVWith the CNC machine, you can make new parts for it
p204
aVover its life or even use it to make the house next door.
p205
aVSo we can begin to see the seed of a completely open-source,
p206
aVcitizen-led urban development model, potentially.
p207
aa(lp208
VAnd we and others have built a few prototypes around the world now,
p209
aVand some really interesting lessons here.
p210
aVOne of them is that it's always incredibly sociable.
p211
aVPeople get confused between construction work and having fun.
p212
aVBut the principles of openness go right down
p213
aVinto the really mundane, physical details.
p214
aVLike, never designing a piece that can't be lifted up.
p215
aVOr, when you're designing a piece,
p216
aVmake sure you either can't put it in the wrong way round,
p217
aVor, if you do, it doesn't matter, because it's symmetrical.
p218
aVProbably the principal which runs deepest with us
p219
aVis the principal set out by Linus Torvalds,
p220
aVthe open-source pioneer,
p221
aVwhich was that idea of, "Be lazy like a fox."
p222
aVDon't reinvent the wheel every time.
p223
aVTake what already works, and adapt it for your own needs.
p224
aVContrary to almost everything that you might get taught
p225
aVat an architecture school, copying is good.
p226
aa(lp227
VWhich is appropriate, because actually,
p228
aVthis approach is not innovative.
p229
aVIt's actually how we built buildings
p230
aVfor hundreds of years before the Industrial Revolution
p231
aVin these sorts of community barn-raisings.
p232
aVThe only difference between traditional
p233
aVvernacular architecture and open-source architecture
p234
aVmight be a web connection,
p235
aVbut it's a really, really big difference.
p236
aVWe shared the whole of WikiHouse
p237
aVunder a Creative Commons license,
p238
aVand now what's just beginning to happen
p239
aVis that groups around the world are beginning to take it
p240
aVand use it and hack it and tinker with it, and it's amazing.
p241
aVThere's a cool group over in Christchurch in New Zealand
p242
aVlooking at post-earthquake development housing,
p243
aVand thanks to the TED city Prize,
p244
aVwe're working with an awesome group in one of Rio's favelas
p245
aVto set up a kind of community factory
p246
aVand micro-university.
p247
aVThese are very, very small beginnings,
p248
aVand actually there's more people in the last week
p249
aVwho have got in touch and they're not even on this map.
p250
aVI hope next time you see it, you won't even be able to see the map.
p251
aa(lp252
VWe're aware that WikiHouse is a very, very small answer,
p253
aVbut it's a small answer to a really, really big question,
p254
aVwhich is that globally, right now, the fastest-growing cities
p255
aVare not skyscraper cities.
p256
aVThey're self-made cities in one form or another.
p257
aVIf we're talking about the 21st-century city,
p258
aVthese are the guys who are going to be making it.
p259
aVYou know, like it or not, welcome to the world's biggest design team.
p260
aa(lp261
VSo if we're serious about problems
p262
aVlike climate change, urbanization and health,
p263
aVactually, our existing development models aren't going to do it.
p264
aVAs I think Robert Neuwirth said, there isn't a bank
p265
aVor a corporation or a government or an NGO
p266
aVwho's going to be able to do it
p267
aVif we treat citizens only as consumers.
p268
aVHow extraordinary would it be, though, if collectively
p269
aVwe were to develop solutions not just to the problem
p270
aVof structure that we've been working on,
p271
aVbut to infrastructure problems like solar-powered air conditioning,
p272
aVoff-grid energy, off-grid sanitation \u2014
p273
aVlow-cost, open-source, high-performance solutions
p274
aVthat anyone can very, very easily make,
p275
aVand to put them all into a commons
p276
aVwhere they're owned by everyone and they're accessible by everyone?
p277
aVA kind of Wikipedia for stuff?
p278
aVAnd once something's in the commons,
p279
aVit will always be there.
p280
aVHow much would that change the rules?
p281
aVAnd I think the technology's on our side.
p282
aa(lp283
VIf design's great project in the 20th century
p284
aVwas the democratization of consumption \u2014
p285
aVthat was Henry Ford, Levittown, Coca-Cola, IKEA \u2014
p286
aVI think design's great project in the 21st century
p287
aVis the democratization of production.
p288
aVAnd when it comes to architecture in cities,
p289
aVthat really matters.
p290
aVThank you very much.
