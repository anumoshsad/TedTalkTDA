VI would like to talk to you about
p4
aVa very special group of animals.
p5
aa(lp6
VThere are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
p7
aVVultures are amongst the most threatened group of birds.
p8
aVWhen you see a vulture like this, the first thing
p9
aVthat comes to your mind is, these are disgusting, ugly,
p10
aVgreedy creatures that are just after your flesh,
p11
aVassociated with politicians. (Laughter) (Applause)
p12
aVI want to change that perception. I want to change
p13
aVthose feelings you have for these birds, because
p14
aVthey need our sympathy. They really do. (Laughter)
p15
aVAnd I'll tell you why.
p16
aa(lp17
VFirst of all, why do they have such a bad press?
p18
aVWhen Charles Darwin went across the Atlantic in 1832
p19
aVon the Beagle, he saw the turkey vulture,
p20
aVand he said, "These are disgusting birds
p21
aVwith bald scarlet heads that are formed to revel in putridity." (Laughter)
p22
aVYou could not get a worse insult, and that from Charles Darwin. (Laughter)
p23
aVYou know, he changed his mind when he came back,
p24
aVand I'll tell you why.
p25
aVThey've also be associated with Disney \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p26
aVpersonified as goofy, dumb, stupid characters.
p27
aa(lp28
VMore recently, if you've been following the Kenyan press
p29
aV\u2014 (Laughter) (Applause) (Cheers) \u2014
p30
aVthese are the attributes that they associated
p31
aVthe Kenyan MPs with. But I want to challenge that.
p32
aVI want to challenge that. Do you know why?
p33
aVBecause MPs
p34
aVdo not keep the environment clean. (Laughter)
p35
aVMPs do not help to prevent the spread of diseases.
p36
aVThey are hardly monogamous. (Laughter) (Applause)
p37
aVThey are far from being extinct. (Laughter)
p38
aVAnd, my favorite is, vultures are better looking. (Applause) (Laughter)
p39
aa(lp40
VSo there's two types of vultures in this planet.
p41
aVThere are the New World vultures that are mainly found
p42
aVin the Americas, like the condors and the caracaras,
p43
aVand then the Old World vultures, where we have
p44
aV16 species. From these 16, 11 of them are facing
p45
aVa high risk of extinction.
p46
aa(lp47
VSo why are vultures important? First of all,
p48
aVthey provide vital ecological services. They clean up.
p49
aVThey're our natural garbage collectors.
p50
aVThey clean up carcasses right to the bone.
p51
aVThey help to kill all the bacteria. They help absorb anthrax
p52
aVthat would otherwise spread and cause
p53
aVhuge livestock losses and diseases in other animals.
p54
aVRecent studies have shown that in areas where there are
p55
aVno vultures, carcasses take up to three to four times
p56
aVto decompose, and this has huge ramifications
p57
aVfor the spread of diseases.
p58
aa(lp59
VVultures also have tremendous historical significance.
p60
aVThey have been associated in ancient Egyptian culture.
p61
aVNekhbet was the symbol of the protector
p62
aVand the motherhood, and together with the cobra,
p63
aVsymbolized the unity between Upper and Lower Egypt.
p64
aVIn Hindu mythology, Jatayu was the vulture god,
p65
aVand he risked his life in order to save the goddess Sita
p66
aVfrom the 10-headed demon Ravana.
p67
aVIn Tibetan culture, they are performing very important
p68
aVsky burials. In places like Tibet, there are no places
p69
aVto bury the dead, or wood to cremate them,
p70
aVso these vultures provide a natural disposal system.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo what is the problem with vultures?
p73
aVWe have eight species of vultures that occur in Kenya,
p74
aVof which six are highly threatened with extinction.
p75
aVThe reason is that they're getting poisoned, and the reason
p76
aVthat they're getting poisoned is because there's
p77
aVhuman-wildlife conflicts. The pastoral communities
p78
aVare using this poison to target predators,
p79
aVand in return, the vultures are falling victim to this.
p80
aa(lp81
VIn South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan,
p82
aVfour species of vultures are listed as critically endangered,
p83
aVwhich means they have less than 10 or 15 years to go extinct,
p84
aVand the reason is because they are falling prey
p85
aVby consuming livestock that has been treated
p86
aVwith a painkilling drug like Diclofenac.
p87
aVThis drug has now been banned for veterinary use in India,
p88
aVand they have taken a stand.
p89
aVBecause there are no vultures, there's been a spread
p90
aVin the numbers of feral dogs at carcass dump sites,
p91
aVand when you have feral dogs, you have a huge time bomb
p92
aVof rabies. The number of cases of rabies
p93
aVhas increased tremendously in India.
p94
aa(lp95
VKenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Africa:
p96
aV353 wind turbines are going to be up at Lake Turkana.
p97
aVI am not against wind energy, but we need to work
p98
aVwith the governments, because wind turbines
p99
aVdo this to birds. They slice them in half.
p100
aVThey are bird-blending machines.
p101
aVIn West Africa, there's a horrific trade
p102
aVof dead vultures to serve the witchcraft and the fetish market.
p103
aa(lp104
VSo what's being done? Well, we're conducting research
p105
aVon these birds. We're putting transmitters on them.
p106
aVWe're trying to determine their basic ecology,
p107
aVand see where they go.
p108
aVWe can see that they travel different countries, so
p109
aVif you focus on a problem locally, it's not going to help you.
p110
aVWe need to work with governments in regional levels.
p111
aVWe're working with local communities.
p112
aVWe're talking to them about appreciating vultures,
p113
aVabout the need from within to appreciate these
p114
aVwonderful creatures and the services that they provide.
p115
aa(lp116
VHow can you help? You can become active,
p117
aVmake noise. You can write a letter to your government
p118
aVand tell them that we need to focus on these very
p119
aVmisunderstood creatures. Volunteer your time
p120
aVto spread the word. Spread the word.
p121
aVWhen you walk out of this room, you will be informed
p122
aVabout vultures, but speak to your families, to your children,
p123
aVto your neighbors about vultures.
p124
aa(lp125
VThey are very graceful. Charles Darwin said
p126
aVhe changed his mind because he watched them fly
p127
aVeffortlessly without energy in the skies.
p128
aVKenya, this world, will be much poorer
p129
aVwithout these wonderful species.
p130
aVThank you very much. (Applause)
