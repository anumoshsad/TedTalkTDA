VThis is my first time at TED. Normally, as an advertising man,
p4
aVI actually speak at TED Evil, which is TED's secret sister
p5
aVthat pays all the bills.
p6
aVIt's held every two years in Burma.
p7
aVAnd I particularly remember a really good speech
p8
aVby Kim Jong Il on how to get teens smoking again.
p9
aV(Laughter)
p10
aa(lp11
VBut, actually, it's suddenly come to me after years working in the business,
p12
aVthat what we create in advertising,
p13
aVwhich is intangible value \u2014 you might call it perceived value,
p14
aVyou might call it badge value, subjective value,
p15
aVintangible value of some kind \u2014
p16
aVgets rather a bad rap.
p17
aVIf you think about it, if you want to live in a world in the future
p18
aVwhere there are fewer material goods, you basically have two choices.
p19
aVYou can either live in a world which is poorer,
p20
aVwhich people in general don't like.
p21
aVOr you can live in a world where actually intangible value
p22
aVconstitutes a greater part of overall value,
p23
aVthat actually intangible value, in many ways
p24
aVis a very, very fine substitute
p25
aVfor using up labor or limited resources
p26
aVin the creation of things.
p27
aa(lp28
VHere is one example. This is a train which goes from London to Paris.
p29
aVThe question was given to a bunch of engineers,
p30
aVabout 15 years ago, "How do we make the journey to Paris better?"
p31
aVAnd they came up with a very good engineering solution,
p32
aVwhich was to spend six billion pounds
p33
aVbuilding completely new tracks
p34
aVfrom London to the coast,
p35
aVand knocking about 40 minutes off a three-and-half-hour journey time.
p36
aVNow, call me Mister Picky. I'm just an ad man ...
p37
aV... but it strikes me as a slightly unimaginative way of improving a train journey
p38
aVmerely to make it shorter.
p39
aVNow what is the hedonic opportunity cost
p40
aVon spending six billion pounds on those railway tracks?
p41
aa(lp42
VHere is my naive advertising man's suggestion.
p43
aVWhat you should in fact do is employ all of the world's top male
p44
aVand female supermodels,
p45
aVpay them to walk the length of the train, handing out free Chateau Petrus
p46
aVfor the entire duration of the journey.
p47
aV(Laughter)
p48
aV(Applause)
p49
aVNow, you'll still have about three billion pounds left in change,
p50
aVand people will ask for the trains to be slowed down.
p51
aV(Laughter)
p52
aa(lp53
VNow, here is another naive advertising man's question again.
p54
aVAnd this shows that engineers,
p55
aVmedical people, scientific people,
p56
aVhave an obsession with solving the problems of reality,
p57
aVwhen actually most problems, once you reach a basic level of wealth
p58
aVin society, most problems are actually problems of perception.
p59
aVSo I'll ask you another question.
p60
aVWhat on earth is wrong with placebos?
p61
aVThey seem fantastic to me. They cost very little to develop.
p62
aVThey work extraordinarily well.
p63
aVThey have no side effects,
p64
aVor if they do, they're imaginary, so you can safely ignore them.
p65
aV(Laughter)
p66
aa(lp67
VSo I was discussing this. And I actually went to the Marginal Revolution blog
p68
aVby Tyler Cowen. I don't know if anybody knows it.
p69
aVSomeone was actually suggesting that you can take this concept further,
p70
aVand actually produce placebo education.
p71
aVThe point is that education doesn't actually work by teaching you things.
p72
aVIt actually works by giving you the impression
p73
aVthat you've had a very good education, which gives you an insane sense
p74
aVof unwarranted self-confidence,
p75
aVwhich then makes you very, very successful in later life.
p76
aVSo, welcome to Oxford, ladies and gentlemen.
p77
aV(Laughter)
p78
aV(Applause)
p79
aa(lp80
VBut, actually, the point of placebo education is interesting.
p81
aVHow many problems of life can be solved
p82
aVactually by tinkering with perception,
p83
aVrather than that tedious, hardworking and messy business
p84
aVof actually trying to change reality?
p85
aVHere's a great example from history. I've heard this attributed to several other kings,
p86
aVbut doing a bit of historical research,
p87
aVit seems to be Fredrick the Great.
p88
aVFredrick the Great of Prussia was very, very keen
p89
aVfor the Germans to adopt the potato and to eat it,
p90
aVbecause he realized that if you had two sources of carbohydrate,
p91
aVwheat and potatoes, you get less price volatility in bread.
p92
aVAnd you get a far lower risk of famine,
p93
aVbecause you actually had two crops to fall back on, not one.
p94
aa(lp95
VThe only problem is: potatoes, if you think about it, look pretty disgusting.
p96
aVAnd also, 18th century Prussians ate very, very few vegetables \u2014
p97
aVrather like contemporary Scottish people.
p98
aV(Laughter)
p99
aVSo, actually, he tried making it compulsory.
p100
aVThe Prussian peasantry said,
p101
aV"We can't even get the dogs to eat these damn things.
p102
aVThey are absolutely disgusting and they're good for nothing."
p103
aVThere are even records of people being executed
p104
aVfor refusing to grow potatoes.
p105
aa(lp106
VSo he tried plan B.
p107
aVHe tried the marketing solution, which is he declared the potato
p108
aVas a royal vegetable, and none but the royal family could consume it.
p109
aVAnd he planted it in a royal potato patch,
p110
aVwith guards who had instructions
p111
aVto guard over it, night and day,
p112
aVbut with secret instructions not to guard it very well.
p113
aV(Laughter)
p114
aVNow, 18th century peasants know that there is one
p115
aVpretty safe rule in life, which is if something is worth guarding,
p116
aVit's worth stealing.
p117
aVBefore long, there was a massive underground
p118
aVpotato-growing operation in Germany.
p119
aVWhat he'd effectively done is he'd re-branded the potato.
p120
aVIt was an absolute masterpiece.
p121
aa(lp122
VI told this story and a gentleman from Turkey came up to me and said,
p123
aV"Very, very good marketer, Fredrick the Great. But not a patch on Ataturk."
p124
aVAtaturk, rather like Nicolas Sarkozy,
p125
aVwas very keen to discourage the wearing of a veil,
p126
aVin Turkey, to modernize it.
p127
aVNow, boring people would have just simply banned the veil.
p128
aVBut that would have ended up with a lot of awful kickback
p129
aVand a hell of a lot of resistance.
p130
aVAtaturk was a lateral thinker.
p131
aVHe made it compulsory for prostitutes to wear the veil.
p132
aV(Laughter)
p133
aV(Applause)
p134
aa(lp135
VI can't verify that fully, but it does not matter.
p136
aVThere is your environmental problem solved, by the way, guys:
p137
aVAll convicted child molesters
p138
aVhave to drive a Porsche Cayenne.
p139
aV(Laughter)
p140
aVWhat Ataturk realized actually is two very fundamental things.
p141
aVWhich is that, actually, first one,
p142
aVall value is actually relative.
p143
aVAll value is perceived value.
p144
aa(lp145
VFor those of you who don't speak Spanish, jugo de naranja \u2014 it's actually the Spanish for "orange juice."
p146
aVBecause actually it's not the dollar. It's actually the peso
p147
aVin Buenos Aires. Very clever Buenos Aires street vendors
p148
aVdecided to practice price discrimination
p149
aVto the detriment of any passing gringo tourists.
p150
aVAs an advertising man, I have to admire that.
p151
aa(lp152
VBut the first thing is that all value is subjective.
p153
aVSecond point is that persuasion is often better than compulsion.
p154
aVThese funny signs that flash your speed at you,
p155
aVsome of the new ones, on the bottom right,
p156
aVnow actually show a smiley face or a frowny face,
p157
aVto act as an emotional trigger.
p158
aVWhat's fascinating about these signs is they cost about 10 percent
p159
aVof the running cost of a conventional speed camera,
p160
aVbut they prevent twice as many accidents.
p161
aVSo, the bizarre thing, which is baffling
p162
aVto conventional, classically trained economists,
p163
aVis that a weird little smiley face
p164
aVhas a better effect on changing your behavior
p165
aVthan the threat of a £60 fine and three penalty points.
p166
aa(lp167
VTiny little behavioral economics detail:
p168
aVin Italy, penalty points go backwards.
p169
aVYou start with 12 and they take them away.
p170
aVBecause they found that loss aversion
p171
aVis a more powerful influence on people's behavior.
p172
aVIn Britain we tend to feel, "Whoa! Got another three!"
p173
aVNot so in Italy.
p174
aa(lp175
VAnother fantastic case of creating intangible value
p176
aVto replace actual or material value, which remember, is what,
p177
aVafter all, the environmental movement needs to be about:
p178
aVThis again is from Prussia, from, I think, about 1812, 1813.
p179
aVThe wealthy Prussians, to help in the war against the French,
p180
aVwere encouraged to give in all their jewelry.
p181
aVAnd it was replaced with replica jewelry
p182
aVmade of cast iron.
p183
aVHere's one: "Gold gab ich für Eisen, 1813."
p184
aVThe interesting thing is that for 50 years hence,
p185
aVthe highest status jewelry you could wear in Prussia
p186
aVwasn't made of gold or diamonds.
p187
aVIt was made of cast iron.
p188
aVBecause actually, never mind the actual intrinsic value
p189
aVof having gold jewelry. This actually
p190
aVhad symbolic value, badge value.
p191
aVIt said that your family had made a great sacrifice in the past.
p192
aa(lp193
VSo, the modern equivalent would of course be this.
p194
aV(Laughter)
p195
aVBut, actually, there is a thing, just as there are Veblen goods,
p196
aVwhere the value of the good depends on it being expensive and rare \u2014
p197
aVthere are opposite kind of things
p198
aVwhere actually the value in them depends on them being
p199
aVubiquitous, classless and minimalistic.
p200
aa(lp201
VIf you think about it, Shakerism was a proto-environmental movement.
p202
aVAdam Smith talks about 18th century America,
p203
aVwhere the prohibition against visible displays of wealth was so great,
p204
aVit was almost a block in the economy in New England,
p205
aVbecause even wealthy farmers could find nothing to spend their money on
p206
aVwithout incurring the displeasure of their neighbors.
p207
aVIt's perfectly possible to create these social pressures
p208
aVwhich lead to more egalitarian societies.
p209
aa(lp210
VWhat's also interesting, if you look at products
p211
aVthat have a high component
p212
aVof what you might call messaging value,
p213
aVa high component of intangible value, versus their intrinsic value:
p214
aVThey are often quite egalitarian.
p215
aVIn terms of dress, denim is perhaps the perfect example of something
p216
aVwhich replaces material value with symbolic value.
p217
aVCoca-Cola. A bunch of you may be a load of pinkos,
p218
aVand you may not like the Coca-Cola company,
p219
aVbut it's worth remembering Andy Warhol's point about Coke.
p220
aVWhat Warhol said about Coke is, he said,
p221
aV"What I really like about Coca-Cola is the president of the United States
p222
aVcan't get a better Coke than the bum on the corner of the street."
p223
aVNow, that is, actually, when you think about it \u2014 we take it for granted \u2014
p224
aVit's actually a remarkable achievement,
p225
aVto produce something that's that democratic.
p226
aa(lp227
VNow, we basically have to change our views slightly.
p228
aVThere is a basic view that real value involves making things,
p229
aVinvolves labor. It involves engineering.
p230
aVIt involves limited raw materials.
p231
aVAnd that what we add on top is kind of false. It's a fake version.
p232
aVAnd there is a reason for some suspicion and uncertainly about it.
p233
aVIt patently veers toward propaganda.
p234
aVHowever, what we do have now
p235
aVis a much more variegated media ecosystem
p236
aVin which to kind of create this kind of value, and it's much fairer.
p237
aa(lp238
VWhen I grew up, this was basically the media environment of my childhood
p239
aVas translated into food.
p240
aVYou had a monopoly supplier. On the left,
p241
aVyou have Rupert Murdoch, or the BBC.
p242
aV(Laughter)
p243
aVAnd on your right you have a dependent public
p244
aVwhich is pathetically grateful for anything you give it.
p245
aV(Laughter)
p246
aa(lp247
VNowadays, the user is actually involved.
p248
aVThis is actually what's called, in the digital world, "user-generated content."
p249
aVAlthough it's called agriculture in the world of food.
p250
aV(Laughter)
p251
aVThis is actually called a mash-up,
p252
aVwhere you take content that someone else has produced
p253
aVand you do something new with it.
p254
aVIn the world of food we call it cooking.
p255
aVThis is food 2.0,
p256
aVwhich is food you produce for the purpose of sharing it with other people.
p257
aVThis is mobile food. British are very good at that.
p258
aVFish and chips in newspaper, the Cornish Pasty,
p259
aVthe pie, the sandwich.
p260
aVWe invented the whole lot of them.
p261
aVWe're not very good at food in general. Italians do great food,
p262
aVbut it's not very portable, generally.
p263
aV(Laughter)
p264
aa(lp265
VI only learned this the other day. The Earl of Sandwich didn't invent the sandwich.
p266
aVHe actually invented the toasty. But then, the Earl of Toasty would be a ridiculous name.
p267
aV(Laughter)
p268
aa(lp269
VFinally, we have contextual communication.
p270
aVNow, the reason I show you Pernod \u2014 it's only one example.
p271
aVEvery country has a contextual alcoholic drink. In France it's Pernod.
p272
aVIt tastes great within the borders of that country,
p273
aVbut absolute shite if you take it anywhere else.
p274
aV(Laughter)
p275
aVUnicum in Hungary, for example.
p276
aVThe Greeks have actually managed to produce something called Retsina,
p277
aVwhich even tastes shite when you're in Greece.
p278
aV(Laughter)
p279
aa(lp280
VBut so much communication now is contextual
p281
aVthat the capacity for actually nudging people,
p282
aVfor giving them better information \u2014 B.J. Fogg,
p283
aVat the University of Stanford, makes the point
p284
aVthat actually the mobile phone is \u2014
p285
aVHe's invented the phrase, "persuasive technologies."
p286
aVHe believes the mobile phone, by being location-specific,
p287
aVcontextual, timely and immediate,
p288
aVis simply the greatest persuasive technology device ever invented.
p289
aa(lp290
VNow, if we have all these tools at our disposal,
p291
aVwe simply have to ask the question,
p292
aVand Thaler and Sunstein have, of how we can use these more intelligently.
p293
aVI'll give you one example.
p294
aVIf you had a large red button of this kind, on the wall of your home,
p295
aVand every time you pressed it, it saved 50 dollars for you,
p296
aVput 50 dollars into your pension,
p297
aVyou would save a lot more.
p298
aVThe reason is that the interface fundamentally determines
p299
aVthe behavior. Okay?
p300
aa(lp301
VNow, marketing has done a very, very good job of creating
p302
aVopportunities for impulse buying.
p303
aVYet we've never created the opportunity for impulse saving.
p304
aVIf you did this, more people would save more.
p305
aVIt's simply a question of changing the interface
p306
aVby which people make decisions,
p307
aVand the very nature of the decisions changes.
p308
aVObviously, I don't want people to do this,
p309
aVbecause as an advertising man I tend to regard saving as just
p310
aVconsumerism needlessly postponed.
p311
aV(Laughter)
p312
aVBut if anybody did want to do that,
p313
aVthat's the kind of thing we need to be thinking about, actually:
p314
aVfundamental opportunities to change human behavior.
p315
aa(lp316
VNow, I've got an example here from Canada.
p317
aVThere was a young intern at Ogilvy Canada
p318
aVcalled Hunter Somerville,
p319
aVwho was working in improv in Toronto,
p320
aVand got a part-time job in advertising,
p321
aVand was given the job of advertising Shreddies.
p322
aVNow this is the most perfect case of creating
p323
aVintangible, added value,
p324
aVwithout changing the product in the slightest.
p325
aVShreddies is a strange, square, whole-grain cereal,
p326
aVonly available in New Zealand, Canada and Britain.
p327
aVIt's Kraft's peculiar way of rewarding loyalty to the crown.
p328
aV(Laughter)
p329
aVIn working out how you could re-launch Shreddies,
p330
aVhe came up with this.
p331
aa(lp332
VVideo: (Buzzer)
p333
aVMan: Shreddies is supposed to be square.
p334
aV(Laughter)
p335
aa(lp336
VWoman: Have any of these diamond shapes gone out?
p337
aV(Laughter)
p338
aa(lp339
VVoiceover: New Diamond Shreddies cereal.
p340
aVSame 100 percent whole-grain wheat in a delicious diamond shape.
p341
aV(Applause)
p342
aa(lp343
VRory Sutherland: I'm not sure this isn't the most perfect example
p344
aVof intangible value creation. All it requires is
p345
aVphotons, neurons, and a great idea to create this thing.
p346
aVI would say it's a work of genius.
p347
aVBut, naturally, you can't do this kind of thing without a little bit of market research.
p348
aa(lp349
VMan: So, Shreddies is actually producing a new product,
p350
aVwhich is something very exciting for them.
p351
aVSo they are introducing new Diamond Shreddies.
p352
aV(Laughter)
p353
aVSo I just want to get your first impressions when you see that,
p354
aVwhen you see the Diamond Shreddies box there.
p355
aV(Laughter)
p356
aa(lp357
VWoman: Weren't they square?
p358
aa(lp359
VWoman #2: I'm a little bit confused. Woman #3: They look like the squares to me.
p360
aa(lp361
VMan: They \u2014 Yeah, it's all in the appearance.
p362
aVBut it's kind of like flipping a six or a nine. Like a six,
p363
aVif you flip it over it looks like a nine.
p364
aVBut a six is very different from a nine.
p365
aa(lp366
VWoman # 3: Or an "M" and a "W". Man: An "M" and a "W", exactly.
p367
aa(lp368
VMan #2: [unclear]
p369
aVYou just looked like you turned it on its end. But when you see it like that
p370
aVit's more interesting looking.
p371
aa(lp372
VMan: Just try both of them.
p373
aVTake a square one there, first.
p374
aV(Laughter)
p375
aVMan: Which one did you prefer? Man #2: The first one.
p376
aa(lp377
VMan: The first one?
p378
aV(Laughter)
p379
aa(lp380
VRory Sutherland: Now, naturally, a debate raged.
p381
aVThere were conservative elements in Canada, unsurprisingly,
p382
aVwho actually resented this intrusion.
p383
aVSo, eventually, the manufacturers actually
p384
aVarrived at a compromise, which was the combo pack.
p385
aV(Laughter)
p386
aV(Applause)
p387
aV(Laughter)
p388
aa(lp389
VIf you think it's funny, bear in mind there is an organization called
p390
aVthe American Institute of Wine Economics,
p391
aVwhich actually does extensive research into perception of things,
p392
aVand discovers that except for among
p393
aVperhaps five or ten percent of the most knowledgeable people,
p394
aVthere is no correlation between quality and enjoyment
p395
aVin wine,
p396
aVexcept when you tell the people how expensive it is,
p397
aVin which case they tend to enjoy the more expensive stuff more.
p398
aVSo drink your wine blind in the future.
p399
aa(lp400
VBut this is both hysterically funny \u2014
p401
aVbut I think an important philosophical point,
p402
aVwhich is, going forward, we need more of this kind of value.
p403
aVWe need to spend more time appreciating what already exists,
p404
aVand less time agonizing over what else we can do.
p405
aa(lp406
VTwo quotations to more or less end with.
p407
aVOne of them is, "Poetry is when you make new things
p408
aVfamiliar and familiar things new."
p409
aVWhich isn't a bad definition of what our job is,
p410
aVto help people appreciate what is unfamiliar, but also
p411
aVto gain a greater appreciation, and place a far higher value on
p412
aVthose things which are already existing.
p413
aVThere is some evidence, by the way, that things like social networking help do that.
p414
aVBecause they help people share news.
p415
aVThey give badge value to everyday little trivial activities.
p416
aVSo they actually reduce the need for actually spending great money on display,
p417
aVand increase the kind of third-party
p418
aVenjoyment you can get from the smallest, simplest things in life. Which is magic.
p419
aa(lp420
VThe second one is the second G.K. Chesterton quote of this session,
p421
aVwhich is, "We are perishing for want of wonder, not for want of wonders,"
p422
aVwhich I think for anybody involved in technology, is perfectly true.
p423
aVAnd a final thing: When you place a value on things like health,
p424
aVlove, sex and other things,
p425
aVand learn to place a material value
p426
aVon what you've previously discounted
p427
aVfor being merely intangible, a thing not seen,
p428
aVyou realize you're much, much wealthier than you ever imagined.
p429
aVThank you very much indeed.
