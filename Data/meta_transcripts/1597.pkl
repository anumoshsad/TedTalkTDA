VIn the 17th century, a woman named Giulia Tofana
p4
aVhad a very successful perfume business.
p5
aVFor over 50 years she ran it.
p6
aVIt sort of ended abruptly when she was executed \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p7
aVfor murdering 600 men. You see, it wasn't a very good perfume.
p8
aVIn fact, it was completely odorless and tasteless and colorless,
p9
aVbut as a poison, it was the best money could buy,
p10
aVso women flocked to her in order to murder their husbands.
p11
aa(lp12
VIt turns out that poisoners were a valued and feared group,
p13
aVbecause poisoning a human being is a quite difficult thing.
p14
aVThe reason is, we have sort of a built-in poison detector.
p15
aVYou can see this as early as even in newborn infants.
p16
aVIf you are willing to do this, you can take a couple of drops
p17
aVof a bitter substance or a sour substance,
p18
aVand you'll see that face, the tongue stick out, the wrinkled nose,
p19
aVas if they're trying to get rid of what's in their mouth.
p20
aVThis reaction expands into adulthood and becomes
p21
aVsort of a full-blown disgust response, no longer just
p22
aVabout whether or not we're about to be poisoned,
p23
aVbut whenever there's a threat of physical contamination
p24
aVfrom some source. But the face remains strikingly similar.
p25
aVIt has expanded more, though, than just keeping us away
p26
aVfrom physical contaminants, and there's a growing
p27
aVbody of evidence to suggest that, in fact, this emotion
p28
aVof disgust now influences our moral beliefs
p29
aVand even our deeply held political intuitions.
p30
aa(lp31
VWhy this might be the case?
p32
aVWe can understand this process by understanding
p33
aVa little bit about emotions in general. So the basic human emotions,
p34
aVthose kinds of emotions that we share with all other human beings,
p35
aVexist because they motivate us to do good things
p36
aVand they keep us away from doing bad things.
p37
aVSo by and large, they are good for our survival.
p38
aVTake the emotion of fear, for instance. It keeps us away
p39
aVfrom doing things that are really, really risky.
p40
aVThis photo taken just before his death \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p41
aVis actually a \u2014 No, one reason this photo is interesting
p42
aVis because most people would not do this, and if they did,
p43
aVthey would not live to tell it, because fear would have
p44
aVkicked in a long time ago to a natural predator.
p45
aVJust like fear offers us protective benefits, disgust seems
p46
aVto do the same thing, except for what disgust does is
p47
aVkeeps us away from not things that might eat us,
p48
aVor heights, but rather things that might poison us,
p49
aVor give us disease and make us sick.
p50
aVSo one of the features of disgust that makes it such
p51
aVan interesting emotion is that it's very, very easy to elicit,
p52
aVin fact more so than probably any of the other basic emotions,
p53
aVand so I'm going to show you that with a couple of images
p54
aVI can probably make you feel disgust.
p55
aVSo turn away. I'll tell you when you can turn back.
p56
aV(Laughter)
p57
aa(lp58
VI mean, you see it every day, right? I mean, come on. (Laughter)
p59
aa(lp60
V(Audience: Ewww.)
p61
aa(lp62
VOkay, turn back, if you didn't look.
p63
aa(lp64
VThose probably made a lot of you in the audience
p65
aVfeel very, very disgusted, but if you didn't look,
p66
aVI can tell you about some of the other things that have been shown
p67
aVsort of across the world to make people disgusted,
p68
aVthings like feces, urine, blood, rotten flesh.
p69
aVThese are the sorts of things that it makes sense
p70
aVfor us to stay away from, because they might actually contaminate us.
p71
aVIn fact, just having a diseased appearance
p72
aVor odd sexual acts, these things are also
p73
aVthings that give us a lot of disgust.
p74
aa(lp75
VDarwin was probably one of the first scientists
p76
aVto systematically investigate the human emotions,
p77
aVand he pointed to the universal nature and the strength
p78
aVof the disgust response.
p79
aVThis is an anecdote from his travels in South America.
p80
aa(lp81
V"In Tierro del Fuego a native touched with his finger
p82
aVsome cold preserved meat while I was eating ...
p83
aVand plainly showed disgust at its softness, whilst I felt
p84
aVutter disgust at my food being touched by a naked savage \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p85
aVthough his hands did not appear dirty."
p86
aVHe later wrote, "It's okay, some of my best friends are naked savages." (Laughter)
p87
aa(lp88
VWell it turns out it's not only old-timey British scientists
p89
aVwho are this squeamish. I recently got a chance
p90
aVto talk to Richard Dawkins for a documentary,
p91
aVand I was able to disgust him a bunch of times. Here's my favorite.
p92
aa(lp93
VRichard Dawkins: "We've evolved around courtship and sex,
p94
aVare attached to deep-rooted emotions and reactions
p95
aVthat are hard to jettison overnight."
p96
aa(lp97
VDavid Pizarro: So my favorite part of this clip is that
p98
aVProfessor Dawkins actually gagged.
p99
aVHe jumps back, and he gags, and we had to do it three times,
p100
aVand all three times he gagged. (Laughter)
p101
aVAnd he was really gagging. I thought he might throw up on me, actually.
p102
aa(lp103
VOne of the features, though, of disgust,
p104
aVis not just its universality and its strength,
p105
aVbut the way that it works through association.
p106
aVSo when one disgusting thing touches a clean thing,
p107
aVthat clean thing becomes disgusting, not the other way around.
p108
aVThis makes it very useful as a strategy if you want to
p109
aVconvince somebody that an object or an individual
p110
aVor an entire social group is disgusting and should be avoided.
p111
aVThe philosopher Martha Nussbaum points this out
p112
aVin this quote: "Thus throughout history, certain disgust
p113
aVproperties \u2014 sliminess, bad smell, stickiness, decay, foulness \u2014
p114
aVhave been repeatedly and monotonously been associated with ...
p115
aVJews, women, homosexuals, untouchables, lower-class people \u2014
p116
aVall of those are imagined as tainted by the dirt of the body."
p117
aVLet me give you just some examples of how, some powerful
p118
aVexamples of how this has been used historically.
p119
aVThis comes from a Nazi children's book published in 1938:
p120
aV"Just look at these guys! The louse-infested beards,
p121
aVthe filthy, protruding ears, those stained, fatty clothes...
p122
aVJews often have an unpleasant sweetish odor.
p123
aVIf you have a good nose, you can smell the Jews."
p124
aVA more modern example comes from people who try to
p125
aVconvince us that homosexuality is immoral.
p126
aVThis is from an anti-gay website, where they said
p127
aVgays are "worthy of death for their vile ... sex practices."
p128
aVThey're like "dogs eating their own vomit and sows wallowing in their own feces."
p129
aVThese are disgust properties that are trying to be directly
p130
aVlinked to the social group that you should not like.
p131
aa(lp132
VWhen we were first investigating the role of disgust in
p133
aVmoral judgment, one of the things we became interested in
p134
aVwas whether or not these sorts of appeals are more likely
p135
aVto work in individuals who are more easily disgusted.
p136
aVSo while disgust, along with the other basic emotions,
p137
aVare universal phenomena, it just really is true
p138
aVthat some people are easier to disgust than others.
p139
aVYou could probably see it in the audience members
p140
aVwhen I showed you those disgusting images.
p141
aVThe way that we measured this was by a scale that was
p142
aVconstructed by some other psychologists
p143
aVthat simply asked people across a wide variety of situations
p144
aVhow likely they are to feel disgust.
p145
aVSo here are a couple of examples.
p146
aV"Even if I were hungry, I would not drink a bowl of my
p147
aVfavorite soup if it had been stirred by a used but thoroughly washed fly-swatter."
p148
aV"Do you agree or disagree?" (Laughter)
p149
aV"While you are walking through a tunnel under a railroad track,
p150
aVyou smell urine. Would you be very disgusted or not at all disgusted?"
p151
aVIf you ask enough of these, you can get a general overall
p152
aVscore of disgust sensitivity.
p153
aVIt turns out that this score is actually meaningful.
p154
aVWhen you bring people into the laboratory and you ask
p155
aVthem if they're willing to engage in safe but disgusting behaviors
p156
aVlike eating chocolate that's been baked to look like dog poop,
p157
aVor in this case eating some mealworms that are perfectly healthy but pretty gross,
p158
aVyour score on that scale actually predicts whether or not
p159
aVyou'll be willing to engage in those behaviors.
p160
aa(lp161
VThe first time that we set out to collect data on this
p162
aVand associate it with political or moral beliefs,
p163
aVwe found a general pattern \u2014
p164
aVthis is with the psychologists Yoel Inbar and Paul Bloom \u2014
p165
aVthat in fact, across three studies we kept finding
p166
aVthat people who reported that they were easily disgusted
p167
aValso reported that they were more politically conservative.
p168
aVAnother way to say this, though, is that people
p169
aVwho are very liberal are very hard to disgust. (Laughter)
p170
aa(lp171
VIn a more recent follow-up study, we were able to look at
p172
aVa much greater sample, a much larger sample. In this case,
p173
aVthis is nearly 30,000 U.S. respondents,
p174
aVand we find the same pattern. As you can see,
p175
aVpeople who are on the very conservative side
p176
aVof answering the political orientation scale are
p177
aValso much more likely to report that they're easily disgusted.
p178
aVThis data set also allowed us to statistically control
p179
aVfor a number of things that we knew were both related
p180
aVto political orientation and to disgust sensitivity.
p181
aVSo we were able to control for gender, age, income,
p182
aVeducation, even basic personality variables,
p183
aVand the result stays the same.
p184
aa(lp185
VWhen we actually looked at not just self-reported political orientation,
p186
aVbut voting behavior, we were able to look geographically
p187
aVacross the nation. What we found was that in regions
p188
aVin which people reported high levels of disgust sensitivity,
p189
aVMcCain got more votes.
p190
aVSo it not only predicted self-reported political orientation,
p191
aVbut actual voting behavior. And also we were able,
p192
aVwith this sample, to look across the world,
p193
aVin 121 different countries we asked the same questions,
p194
aVand as you can see, this is 121 countries collapsed
p195
aVinto 10 different geographical regions.
p196
aVNo matter where you look, what this is plotting is the size
p197
aVof the relationship between disgust sensitivity and political orientation,
p198
aVand no matter where we looked, we saw a very similar effect.
p199
aVOther labs have actually looked at this as well
p200
aVusing different measures of disgust sensitivity,
p201
aVso rather than asking people how easily disgusted they are,
p202
aVthey hook people up to physiological measures,
p203
aVin this case skin conductance.
p204
aVAnd what they've demonstrated is that people who report
p205
aVbeing more politically conservative are also more physiologically aroused
p206
aVwhen you show them disgusting images like the ones that I showed you.
p207
aVInterestingly, what they also showed in a finding
p208
aVthat we kept getting in our previous studies as well
p209
aVwas that one of the strongest influences here is that
p210
aVindividuals who are very disgust-sensitive not only are
p211
aVmore likely to report being politically conservative, but
p212
aVthey're also very much more opposed to gay marriage
p213
aVand homosexuality and pretty much a lot of
p214
aVthe socio-moral issues in the sexual domain.
p215
aVSo physiological arousal predicted, in this study,
p216
aVattitudes toward gay marriage.
p217
aa(lp218
VBut even with all these data linking disgust sensitivity
p219
aVand political orientation, one of the questions that remains is
p220
aVwhat is the causal link here? Is it the case that
p221
aVdisgust really is shaping political and moral beliefs?
p222
aVWe have to resort to experimental methods to answer this,
p223
aVand so what we can do is actually bring people into the lab
p224
aVand disgust them and compare them to a control group
p225
aVthat hasn't been disgusted. It turns out that over
p226
aVthe past five years a number of researchers have done this,
p227
aVand by and large the results have all been the same,
p228
aVthat when people are feeling disgust, their attitudes
p229
aVshift towards the right of the political spectrum,
p230
aVtoward more moral conservatism as well.
p231
aVSo this is whether you use a foul odor, a bad taste,
p232
aVfrom film clips, from post-hypnotic suggestions of disgust,
p233
aVimages like the ones I've shown you, even just
p234
aVreminding people that disease is prevalent and they should
p235
aVbe wary of it and wash up, right, to keep clean,
p236
aVthese all have similar effects on judgment.
p237
aa(lp238
VLet me just give you an example from a recent study
p239
aVthat we conducted. We asked participants
p240
aVto just simply give us their opinion of a variety of social groups,
p241
aVand we either made the room smell gross or not.
p242
aVWhen the room smelled gross, what we saw was that
p243
aVindividuals actually reported more negative attitudes toward gay men.
p244
aVDisgust didn't influence attitudes toward all the other
p245
aVsocial groups that we asked, including African-Americans,
p246
aVthe elderly. It really came down to the attitudes they had
p247
aVtoward gay men.
p248
aVIn another set of studies we actually simply reminded people \u2014
p249
aVthis was at a time when the swine flu was going around \u2014
p250
aVwe reminded people that in order to prevent the spread
p251
aVof the flu that they ought to wash their hands.
p252
aVFor some participants, we actually had them take questionnaires
p253
aVnext to a sign that reminded them to wash their hands.
p254
aVAnd what we found was that just taking a questionnaire
p255
aVnext to this hand-sanitizing reminder made individuals
p256
aVreport being more politically conservative.
p257
aVAnd when we asked them a variety of questions about
p258
aVthe rightness or wrongness of certain acts, what we also
p259
aVfound was that simply being reminded that they ought
p260
aVto wash their hands made them more morally conservative.
p261
aVIn particular, when we asked them questions about
p262
aVsort of taboo but fairly harmless sexual practices,
p263
aVjust being reminded that they ought to wash their hands
p264
aVmade them think that they were more morally wrong.
p265
aVLet me give you an example of what I mean by harmless
p266
aVbut taboo sexual practice. We gave them scenarios.
p267
aVOne of them said a man is house-sitting for his grandmother.
p268
aVWhen his grandmother's away, he has sex with his girlfriend
p269
aVon his grandma's bed.
p270
aVIn another one, we said a woman enjoys masturbating
p271
aVwith her favorite teddy bear cuddled next to her. (Laughter)
p272
aVPeople find these to be more morally abhorrent
p273
aVif they've been reminded to wash their hands. (Laughter)
p274
aV(Laughter)
p275
aa(lp276
VOkay. The fact that emotions influence our judgment
p277
aVshould come as no surprise. I mean,
p278
aVthat's part of how emotions work.
p279
aVThey not only motivate you to behave in certain ways,
p280
aVbut they change the way you think.
p281
aVIn the case of disgust, what is a little bit more surprising
p282
aVis the scope of this influence. It makes perfect sense,
p283
aVand it's a very good emotion for us to have, that disgust
p284
aVwould make me change the way that I perceive
p285
aVthe physical world whenever contamination is possible.
p286
aVIt makes less sense that an emotion that was built
p287
aVto prevent me from ingesting poison should predict
p288
aVwho I'm going to vote for in the upcoming presidential election.
p289
aa(lp290
VThe question of whether disgust ought to influence
p291
aVour moral and political judgments
p292
aVcertainly has to be complex, and might depend on exactly
p293
aVwhat judgments we're talking about, and as a scientist,
p294
aVwe have to conclude sometimes that the scientific method
p295
aVis just ill-equipped to answer these sorts of questions.
p296
aVBut one thing that I am fairly certain about is,
p297
aVat the very least, what we can do with this research is
p298
aVpoint to what questions we ought to ask in the first place.
p299
aVThank you. (Applause)
