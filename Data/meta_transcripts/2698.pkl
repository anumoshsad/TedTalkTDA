VI want to introduce you to some very wise kids that I've known,
p4
aVbut first I want to introduce you to a camel.
p5
aVThis is Cassie, a therapy camel visiting one of our young patients
p6
aVin her room,
p7
aVwhich is pretty magical.
p8
aVA friend of mine raises camels at his ranch in the Santa Cruz Mountains.
p9
aVHe has about eight of them,
p10
aVand he started 30 years ago
p11
aVbecause he thought horses were too mundane.
p12
aVJohn is an out-of-the-box thinker,
p13
aVwhich explains why the two of us have been such good friends
p14
aVall of our lives.
p15
aVOver the years, I've convinced him to shuttle those sweet furry beasts
p16
aVup to hang out with our sick kids from time to time.
p17
aVTalking to John, I was surprised to learn
p18
aVthat camels have an average life expectancy of 40 to 50 years.
p19
aVThe life expectancy of many of the children with whom I work
p20
aVis less than a year.
p21
aa(lp22
VThis is a picture of the George Mark Children's House,
p23
aVthe first pediatric palliative respite care center
p24
aVto open in the United States.
p25
aVI founded it in 2004,
p26
aVafter years of working as a psychologist
p27
aVon pediatric intensive care units,
p28
aVfrustrated with the undignified deaths that so many children experienced
p29
aVand their families had to endure.
p30
aVAs I sat with families whose children were at the end of their lives,
p31
aVI was acutely aware of our surroundings.
p32
aVWhile the elevated train rumbled overhead on its track,
p33
aVquite literally the room reverberated with each passing train car.
p34
aVThe lights on the ward were fluorescent and too bright.
p35
aVMonitors beeped, as did the elevator,
p36
aVnoisily announcing its arrival.
p37
aVThese families were experiencing
p38
aVsome of the most excruciating moments of their lives,
p39
aVand I so wanted them to have a more peaceful place
p40
aVin which to say a last goodbye to their young daughters and sons.
p41
aVSurely, I thought,
p42
aVthere must be a better spot than a hospital intensive care unit
p43
aVfor children at the end of their lives.
p44
aa(lp45
VOur children's house
p46
aVis calm and nurturing.
p47
aVIt's a place where families can stay together
p48
aVto enjoy quality time with their children,
p49
aVmany of whom are there for respite stays,
p50
aVsome with repeated visits over a span of many years.
p51
aVWe call those kids our frequent flyers.
p52
aVRather than the bright, noisy quarters of the hospital,
p53
aVtheir rooms are calm and comfortable,
p54
aVwith actual living spaces for the families,
p55
aVa sanctuary of gardens
p56
aVand a wonderful outdoor playground
p57
aVwith special structures for children with physical limitations.
p58
aa(lp59
VThis sweet baby Lars
p60
aVcame to us directly from a hospital intensive care unit.
p61
aVImagine hearing the heartbreaking news
p62
aVthat none of us would ever want to hear.
p63
aVHis parents had been told that Lars had a brain anomaly
p64
aVthat would keep him from ever swallowing,
p65
aVwalking, talking
p66
aVor developing mentally.
p67
aVRecognizing what little chance he had for survival,
p68
aVhis parents chose to focus on the quality of time
p69
aVthat they could spend together.
p70
aVThey moved into one of our family apartments
p71
aVand treasured each day that they had,
p72
aVwhich were far too few.
p73
aVLars's life was brief, to be sure,
p74
aVmere weeks,
p75
aVbut it was calm and comfortable.
p76
aVHe went on hikes with his parents.
p77
aVThe time that he spent in the pool with our aquatic therapist
p78
aVlessened the seizures he was experiencing
p79
aVand helped him to sleep at night.
p80
aVHis family had a peaceful place
p81
aVin which to both celebrate his life
p82
aVand mourn his death.
p83
aa(lp84
VIt has been five years since Lars was with us,
p85
aVand in that time,
p86
aVhis family has welcomed
p87
aVa daughter and another son.
p88
aVThey are such a powerful testament
p89
aVto the positive outcome that specialized children's hospice care can create.
p90
aVTheir baby's physical discomfort was well managed,
p91
aVgiving all of them the gift of time to be together in a beautiful place.
p92
aa(lp93
VI'm going to talk to you now
p94
aVabout the elephant
p95
aVrather than the camel in the room.
p96
aVVery few people want to talk about death,
p97
aVand even fewer about children's death.
p98
aVLoss of a child,
p99
aVespecially for those of us who have our own children,
p100
aVis frightening,
p101
aVmore than frightening,
p102
aVparalyzing,
p103
aVdebilitating,
p104
aVimpossible.
p105
aVBut what I've learned is this:
p106
aVchildren don't stop dying
p107
aVjust because we the adults
p108
aVcan't comprehend the injustice of losing them.
p109
aVAnd what's more,
p110
aVif we can be brave enough
p111
aVto face the possibility of death,
p112
aVeven among the most innocent,
p113
aVwe gain an unparalleled kind of wisdom.
p114
aa(lp115
VTake Crystal, for example.
p116
aVShe was one of the first children to come for care
p117
aVafter we opened our doors.
p118
aVShe was nine when she arrived,
p119
aVand her neurologist expected that she might live another two weeks.
p120
aVShe had an inoperable brain tumor,
p121
aVand her decline had really accelerated
p122
aVin the week before she came to us.
p123
aVAfter settling into her room,
p124
aVdressed entirely in pink and lavender,
p125
aVsurrounded by the Hello Kitty accessories that she loved,
p126
aVshe spent the next several days
p127
aVwinning over the hearts of every staff member.
p128
aVBit by bit, her condition stabilized,
p129
aVand then to our astonishment,
p130
aVshe actually improved.
p131
aVThere were a variety of factors
p132
aVthat contributed to Crystal's improvement
p133
aVwhich we later came to call the "George Mark bump,"
p134
aVa lovely, not uncommon phenomenon
p135
aVwhere children outlive the prognoses of their illnesses
p136
aVif they're outside of the hospital.
p137
aVThe calmer atmosphere of her surroundings,
p138
aVtasty meals that were fixed often to accommodate her requests,
p139
aVthe resident pets,
p140
aVthe therapy dog and rabbit spent lots of cozy time with Crystal.
p141
aa(lp142
VAfter she had been with us for about a week,
p143
aVshe called her grandmother,
p144
aVand she said,
p145
aV"Gee, I'm staying in a great big house,
p146
aVand there's room for you to come, too.
p147
aVAnd guess what?
p148
aVYou don't have to bring any quarters
p149
aVbecause the washer and dryer are free."
p150
aa(lp151
V(Laughter)
p152
aa(lp153
VCrystal's grandmother soon arrived from out of town,
p154
aVand they spent the remaining four months of Crystal's life
p155
aVenjoying very special days together.
p156
aVSome days were special because Crystal was outside in her wheelchair
p157
aVsitting by the fountain.
p158
aVFor a little girl who had spent most of the year earlier in a hospital bed,
p159
aVbeing outside counting hummingbirds
p160
aVmade for an amazing time with her grandma,
p161
aVand lots of laughter.
p162
aVOther days were special because of the activities
p163
aVthat our child life specialist created for her.
p164
aVCrystal strung beads and made jewelry for everybody in the house.
p165
aVShe painted a pumpkin to help decorate for Halloween.
p166
aVShe spent many excited days planning her tenth birthday,
p167
aVwhich of course none of us thought she would ever see.
p168
aVAll of us wore pink boas for the occasion,
p169
aVand Crystal, as you can see,
p170
aVqueen for a day,
p171
aVwore a sparkly tiara.
p172
aa(lp173
VOne hot morning, I arrived at work
p174
aVand Crystal and her partner in crime, Charlie, greeted me.
p175
aVWith some help, they had set up a lemonade and cookie stand
p176
aVoutside the front door,
p177
aVa very strategic location.
p178
aVI asked Crystal the price of the cookie that I had selected,
p179
aVand she said, "Three dollars."
p180
aa(lp181
V(Laughter)
p182
aa(lp183
VI said that seemed a bit high for one cookie.
p184
aa(lp185
V(Laughter)
p186
aa(lp187
VIt was small.
p188
aV"I know," she acknowledged with a grin,
p189
aV"but I'm worth it."
p190
aa(lp191
VAnd therein lie the words of wisdom
p192
aVof a young girl whose brief life forever impacted mine.
p193
aVCrystal was worth it,
p194
aVand shouldn't every child whose life is shortened by a horrific illness
p195
aVbe worth it?
p196
aVTogether, all of us today
p197
aVcan offer that same specialized care that Crystal received
p198
aVby recognizing that children's respite and hospice care
p199
aVis a critical component missing from our healthcare landscape.
p200
aVIt's also interesting to note
p201
aVthat we are able to provide this care
p202
aVat about one third of the cost of a hospital intensive care unit,
p203
aVand our families don't see a bill.
p204
aVWe are ever grateful to the supporters
p205
aVwho believe in this important work that we're doing.
p206
aa(lp207
VThe truth is that my colleagues and I
p208
aVand the parents and other family members
p209
aVwho get to experience this special wisdom
p210
aVare in a unique position.
p211
aVThere are only two freestanding pediatric hospices in the United States,
p212
aValthough I'm happy to report that based on our model,
p213
aVthere are 18 others under various stages of development.
p214
aa(lp215
V(Applause)
p216
aa(lp217
VStill, most of the children who die in the United States every year
p218
aVdie in hospital rooms,
p219
aVsurrounded by beeping machines
p220
aVand anxious, exhausted adults
p221
aVwho have no other option
p222
aVbut to say goodbye under those harsh, institutional lights
p223
aVand among virtual strangers.
p224
aVFor comparison's sake,
p225
aVthe United Kingdom,
p226
aVwhich is a country with about one fifth the population of the United States,
p227
aVand about half the size of the state of California,
p228
aVhas 54 hospice and respite centers.
p229
aVWhy is that?
p230
aVI've asked myself that question obviously many times.
p231
aVMy best guess is that Americans, with our positive can-do attitude
p232
aVhold the expectation that our medical care system will fix it,
p233
aVeven though it may be a childhood illness for which there is no cure.
p234
aVWe go to extraordinary measures to keep children alive
p235
aVwhen in fact the greatest kindness that we might give them
p236
aVwould be a peaceful, pain-free
p237
aVend of life.
p238
aVThe transition from cure to care
p239
aVremains a challenging one for many hospital physicians
p240
aVwhose training has really been about saving lives,
p241
aVnot about gently guiding the patient to the end of life.
p242
aVThe dad of a sweet baby for whom we cared at the end of her life
p243
aVcertainly captured this dichotomy
p244
aVwhen he reflected
p245
aVthat there are a lot of people to help you bring an infant into the world
p246
aVbut very few to help you usher a baby out.
p247
aa(lp248
VSo what is the magic ingredient at George Mark?
p249
aVThe complex medical diagnoses that bring our young patients to us
p250
aVmean that their lives have often been restricted,
p251
aVsome to a hospital bed for long periods of time,
p252
aVothers to wheelchairs,
p253
aVstill others to intensive courses of chemotherapy or rehab.
p254
aVWe make a practice of ignoring those limitations.
p255
aVOur default answer is "yes"
p256
aVand our default question is, "Why not?"
p257
aVThat's why we took a young boy
p258
aVwho wasn't going to live for another baseball season
p259
aVto Game 5 of the World Series.
p260
aVThat's why we have a talent show put on by the staff and kids
p261
aVfor family and friends.
p262
aVWho wouldn't be enchanted by a young boy playing a piano piece with his feet,
p263
aVbecause his arms are atrophied?
p264
aVThat's why we have a prom every year.
p265
aVIt's pretty magical.
p266
aVWe started the prom
p267
aVafter hearing a dad lament
p268
aVthat he would never pin a boutonniere on his son's tuxedo lapel.
p269
aVThe weeks before the dance,
p270
aVthe house is in a flurry,
p271
aVand I don't know who's more excited, the staff or the kids.
p272
aa(lp273
V(Laughter)
p274
aa(lp275
VThe night of the event
p276
aVinvolves rides in vintage cars,
p277
aVa walk on a red carpet
p278
aVinto the great room,
p279
aVa terrific DJ
p280
aVand a photographer at the ready
p281
aVto capture pictures of these attendees
p282
aVand their families.
p283
aVAt the end of the evening this year,
p284
aVone of our young, delightful teenaged girls,
p285
aVCaitlin, said to her mom,
p286
aV"That was the best night of my whole life."
p287
aVAnd that's just the point,
p288
aVto capture the best days and nights,
p289
aVto abolish limitations,
p290
aVto have your default answer be "yes"
p291
aVand your default question be, "Why not?"
p292
aa(lp293
VUltimately life is too short,
p294
aVwhether we live to be 85 years or just eight.
p295
aVTrust me.
p296
aVBetter yet, trust Sam.
p297
aVIt's not by pretending that death doesn't exist
p298
aVthat we keep the people,
p299
aVespecially the little people that we love,
p300
aVsafe.
p301
aVIn the end,
p302
aVwe can't control how long any of us lives.
p303
aVWhat we can control
p304
aVis how we spend our days,
p305
aVthe spaces we create,
p306
aVthe meaning and joy that we make.
p307
aVWe cannot change the outcome,
p308
aVbut we can change the journey.
p309
aVIsn't it time
p310
aVto recognize that children deserve
p311
aVnothing less than our most uncompromising bravery
p312
aVand our wildest imagination.
p313
aa(lp314
