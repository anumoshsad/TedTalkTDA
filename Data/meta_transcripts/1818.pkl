VWhen I was about three or four years old,
p4
aVI remember my mum reading a story to me
p5
aVand my two big brothers,
p6
aVand I remember putting up my hands
p7
aVto feel the page of the book,
p8
aVto feel the picture they were discussing.
p9
aa(lp10
VAnd my mum said, "Darling,
p11
aVremember that you can't see
p12
aVand you can't feel the picture
p13
aVand you can't feel the print on the page."
p14
aa(lp15
VAnd I thought to myself,
p16
aV"But that's what I want to do.
p17
aVI love stories. I want to read."
p18
aVLittle did I know
p19
aVthat I would be part of a technological revolution
p20
aVthat would make that dream come true.
p21
aa(lp22
VI was born premature by about 10 weeks,
p23
aVwhich resulted in my blindness, some 64 years ago.
p24
aVThe condition is known as retrolental fibroplasia,
p25
aVand it's now very rare in the developed world.
p26
aVLittle did I know, lying curled up
p27
aVin my prim baby humidicrib in 1948
p28
aVthat I'd been born at the right place
p29
aVand the right time,
p30
aVthat I was in a country where I could participate
p31
aVin the technological revolution.
p32
aa(lp33
VThere are 37 million totally blind people on our planet,
p34
aVbut those of us who've shared in the technological changes
p35
aVmainly come from North America, Europe,
p36
aVJapan and other developed parts of the world.
p37
aVComputers have changed the lives of us all in this room
p38
aVand around the world,
p39
aVbut I think they've changed the lives
p40
aVof we blind people more than any other group.
p41
aVAnd so I want to tell you about the interaction
p42
aVbetween computer-based adaptive technology
p43
aVand the many volunteers who helped me over the years
p44
aVto become the person I am today.
p45
aVIt's an interaction between volunteers,
p46
aVpassionate inventors and technology,
p47
aVand it's a story that many other blind people could tell.
p48
aVBut let me tell you a bit about it today.
p49
aa(lp50
VWhen I was five, I went to school and I learned braille.
p51
aVIt's an ingenious system of six dots
p52
aVthat are punched into paper,
p53
aVand I can feel them with my fingers.
p54
aVIn fact, I think they're putting up my grade six report.
p55
aVI don't know where Julian Morrow got that from.
p56
aV(Laughter)
p57
aVI was pretty good in reading,
p58
aVbut religion and musical appreciation needed more work.
p59
aV(Laughter)
p60
aa(lp61
VWhen you leave the opera house,
p62
aVyou'll find there's braille signage in the lifts.
p63
aVLook for it. Have you noticed it?
p64
aVI do. I look for it all the time.
p65
aa(lp66
V(Laughter)
p67
aa(lp68
VWhen I was at school,
p69
aVthe books were transcribed by transcribers,
p70
aVvoluntary people who punched one dot at a time
p71
aVso I'd have volumes to read,
p72
aVand that had been going on, mainly by women,
p73
aVsince the late 19th century in this country,
p74
aVbut it was the only way I could read.
p75
aVWhen I was in high school,
p76
aVI got my first Philips reel-to-reel tape recorder,
p77
aVand tape recorders became my sort of pre-computer
p78
aVmedium of learning.
p79
aVI could have family and friends read me material,
p80
aVand I could then read it back
p81
aVas many times as I needed.
p82
aVAnd it brought me into contact
p83
aVwith volunteers and helpers.
p84
aVFor example, when I studied at graduate school
p85
aVat Queen's University in Canada,
p86
aVthe prisoners at the Collins Bay jail agreed to help me.
p87
aVI gave them a tape recorder, and they read into it.
p88
aVAs one of them said to me,
p89
aV"Ron, we ain't going anywhere at the moment."
p90
aa(lp91
V(Laughter)
p92
aa(lp93
VBut think of it. These men,
p94
aVwho hadn't had the educational opportunities I'd had,
p95
aVhelped me gain post-graduate qualifications in law
p96
aVby their dedicated help.
p97
aa(lp98
VWell, I went back and became an academic
p99
aVat Melbourne's Monash University,
p100
aVand for those 25 years,
p101
aVtape recorders were everything to me.
p102
aVIn fact, in my office in 1990,
p103
aVI had 18 miles of tape.
p104
aVStudents, family and friends all read me material.
p105
aVMrs. Lois Doery,
p106
aVwhom I later came to call my surrogate mum,
p107
aVread me many thousands of hours onto tape.
p108
aVOne of the reasons I agreed to give this talk today
p109
aVwas that I was hoping that Lois would be here
p110
aVso I could introduce you to her and publicly thank her.
p111
aVBut sadly, her health hasn't permitted her to come today.
p112
aVBut I thank you here, Lois, from this platform.
p113
aa(lp114
V(Applause)
p115
aa(lp116
VI saw my first Apple computer in 1984,
p117
aVand I thought to myself,
p118
aV"This thing's got a glass screen, not much use to me."
p119
aVHow very wrong I was.
p120
aVIn 1987, in the month our eldest son Gerard was born,
p121
aVI got my first blind computer,
p122
aVand it's actually here.
p123
aVSee it up there?
p124
aVAnd you see it has no, what do you call it, no screen.
p125
aV(Laughter)
p126
aVIt's a blind computer.
p127
aV(Laughter)
p128
aVIt's a Keynote Gold 84k,
p129
aVand the 84k stands for it had 84 kilobytes of memory.
p130
aV(Laughter)
p131
aVDon't laugh, it cost me 4,000 dollars at the time. (Laughter)
p132
aVI think there's more memory in my watch.
p133
aa(lp134
VIt was invented by Russell Smith, a passionate inventor
p135
aVin New Zealand who was trying to help blind people.
p136
aVSadly, he died in a light plane crash in 2005,
p137
aVbut his memory lives on in my heart.
p138
aVIt meant, for the first time,
p139
aVI could read back what I had typed into it.
p140
aVIt had a speech synthesizer.
p141
aVI'd written my first coauthored labor law book
p142
aVon a typewriter in 1979 purely from memory.
p143
aVThis now allowed me to read back what I'd written
p144
aVand to enter the computer world,
p145
aVeven with its 84k of memory.
p146
aa(lp147
VIn 1974, the great Ray Kurzweil, the American inventor,
p148
aVworked on building a machine that would scan books
p149
aVand read them out in synthetic speech.
p150
aVOptical character recognition units then
p151
aVonly operated usually on one font,
p152
aVbut by using charge-coupled device flatbed scanners
p153
aVand speech synthesizers,
p154
aVhe developed a machine that could read any font.
p155
aVAnd his machine, which was as big as a washing machine,
p156
aVwas launched on the 13th of January, 1976.
p157
aVI saw my first commercially available Kurzweil
p158
aVin March 1989, and it blew me away,
p159
aVand in September 1989,
p160
aVthe month that my associate professorship
p161
aVat Monash University was announced,
p162
aVthe law school got one, and I could use it.
p163
aVFor the first time, I could read what I wanted to read
p164
aVby putting a book on the scanner.
p165
aVI didn't have to be nice to people!
p166
aa(lp167
V(Laughter)
p168
aa(lp169
VI no longer would be censored.
p170
aVFor example, I was too shy then,
p171
aVand I'm actually too shy now, to ask anybody
p172
aVto read me out loud sexually explicit material.
p173
aV(Laughter)
p174
aVBut, you know, I could pop a book on in the middle of the night, and \u2014
p175
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p176
aa(lp177
VNow, the Kurzweil reader is simply
p178
aVa program on my laptop.
p179
aVThat's what it's shrunk to.
p180
aVAnd now I can scan the latest novel
p181
aVand not wait to get it into talking book libraries.
p182
aVI can keep up with my friends.
p183
aa(lp184
VThere are many people who have helped me in my life,
p185
aVand many that I haven't met.
p186
aVOne is another American inventor Ted Henter.
p187
aVTed was a motorcycle racer,
p188
aVbut in 1978 he had a car accident and lost his sight,
p189
aVwhich is devastating if you're trying to ride motorbikes.
p190
aVHe then turned to being a waterskier
p191
aVand was a champion disabled waterskier.
p192
aVBut in 1989, he teamed up with Bill Joyce
p193
aVto develop a program that would read out
p194
aVwhat was on the computer screen
p195
aVfrom the Net or from what was on the computer.
p196
aVIt's called JAWS, Job Access With Speech,
p197
aVand it sounds like this.
p198
aa(lp199
V(JAWS speaking)
p200
aa(lp201
VRon McCallum: Isn't that slow?
p202
aa(lp203
V(Laughter)
p204
aVYou see, if I read like that, I'd fall asleep.
p205
aVI slowed it down for you.
p206
aVI'm going to ask that we play it at the speed I read it.
p207
aVCan we play that one?
p208
aa(lp209
V(JAWS speaking)
p210
aa(lp211
V(Laughter)
p212
aa(lp213
VRM: You know, when you're marking student essays,
p214
aVyou want to get through them fairly quickly.
p215
aa(lp216
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p217
aa(lp218
VThis technology that fascinated me in 1987
p219
aVis now on my iPhone and on yours as well.
p220
aVBut, you know, I find reading with machines
p221
aVa very lonely process.
p222
aVI grew up with family, friends, reading to me,
p223
aVand I loved the warmth and the breath
p224
aVand the closeness of people reading.
p225
aVDo you love being read to?
p226
aVAnd one of my most enduring memories
p227
aVis in 1999, Mary reading to me and the children
p228
aVdown near Manly Beach
p229
aV"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone."
p230
aVIsn't that a great book?
p231
aVI still love being close to someone reading to me.
p232
aVBut I wouldn't give up the technology,
p233
aVbecause it's allowed me to lead a great life.
p234
aa(lp235
VOf course, talking books for the blind
p236
aVpredated all this technology.
p237
aVAfter all, the long-playing record was developed
p238
aVin the early 1930s,
p239
aVand now we put talking books on CDs
p240
aVusing the digital access system known as DAISY.
p241
aVBut when I'm reading with synthetic voices,
p242
aVI love to come home and read a racy novel
p243
aVwith a real voice.
p244
aa(lp245
VNow there are still barriers
p246
aVin front of we people with disabilities.
p247
aVMany websites we can't read using JAWS
p248
aVand the other technologies.
p249
aVWebsites are often very visual,
p250
aVand there are all these sorts of graphs
p251
aVthat aren't labeled and buttons that aren't labeled,
p252
aVand that's why the World Wide Web Consortium 3,
p253
aVknown as W3C, has developed worldwide standards
p254
aVfor the Internet.
p255
aVAnd we want all Internet users or Internet site owners
p256
aVto make their sites compatible so that
p257
aVwe persons without vision can have a level playing field.
p258
aVThere are other barriers brought about by our laws.
p259
aVFor example, Australia,
p260
aVlike about one third of the world's countries,
p261
aVhas copyright exceptions which allow books to be brailled
p262
aVor read for we blind persons.
p263
aVBut those books can't travel across borders.
p264
aVFor example, in Spain, there are a 100,000
p265
aVaccessible books in Spanish.
p266
aVIn Argentina, there are 50,000.
p267
aVIn no other Latin American country
p268
aVare there more than a couple of thousand.
p269
aVBut it's not legal to transport the books
p270
aVfrom Spain to Latin America.
p271
aVThere are hundreds of thousands of accessible books
p272
aVin the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia, etc.,
p273
aVbut they can't be transported to the 60 countries
p274
aVin our world where English is the first and the second language.
p275
aVAnd remember I was telling you about Harry Potter.
p276
aVWell, because we can't transport books across borders,
p277
aVthere had to be separate versions read
p278
aVin all the different English-speaking countries:
p279
aVBritain, United States, Canada, Australia,
p280
aVand New Zealand all had to have
p281
aVseparate readings of Harry Potter.
p282
aa(lp283
VAnd that's why, next month in Morocco,
p284
aVa meeting is taking place between all the countries.
p285
aVIt's something that a group of countries
p286
aVand the World Blind Union are advocating,
p287
aVa cross-border treaty
p288
aVso that if books are available under a copyright exception
p289
aVand the other country has a copyright exception,
p290
aVwe can transport those books across borders
p291
aVand give life to people, particularly in developing countries,
p292
aVblind people who don't have the books to read.
p293
aVI want that to happen.
p294
aa(lp295
V(Applause)
p296
aa(lp297
VMy life has been extraordinarily blessed
p298
aVwith marriage and children
p299
aVand certainly interesting work to do,
p300
aVwhether it be at the University of Sydney Law School,
p301
aVwhere I served a term as dean,
p302
aVor now as I sit on the United Nations Committee
p303
aVon the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, in Geneva.
p304
aVI've indeed been a very fortunate human being.
p305
aa(lp306
VI wonder what the future will hold.
p307
aVThe technology will advance even further,
p308
aVbut I can still remember my mum saying, 60 years ago,
p309
aV"Remember, darling,
p310
aVyou'll never be able to read the print with your fingers."
p311
aVI'm so glad that the interaction between braille transcribers,
p312
aVvolunteer readers and passionate inventors,
p313
aVhas allowed this dream of reading to come true for me
p314
aVand for blind people throughout the world.
p315
aa(lp316
VI'd like to thank my researcher Hannah Martin,
p317
aVwho is my slide clicker, who clicks the slides,
p318
aVand my wife, Professor Mary Crock, who's the light of my life,
p319
aVis coming on to collect me.
p320
aVI want to thank her too.
p321
aa(lp322
VI think I have to say goodbye now.
p323
aVBless you. Thank you very much.
p324
aa(lp325
