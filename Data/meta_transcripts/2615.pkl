VFor over a decade,
p4
aVI have studied young people that have been pushed out of school,
p5
aVso called "dropouts."
p6
aVAs they end up failed by the education system,
p7
aVthey're on the streets where they're vulnerable to violence,
p8
aVpolice harassment,
p9
aVpolice brutality
p10
aVand incarceration.
p11
aVI follow these young people for years at a time,
p12
aVacross institutional settings,
p13
aVto try to understand what some of us call the "school-to-prison pipeline."
p14
aa(lp15
VWhen you look at a picture like this,
p16
aVof young people who are in my study ...
p17
aVyou might see trouble.
p18
aVI mean one of the boys has a bottle of liquor in his hand,
p19
aVhe's 14 years old
p20
aVand it's a school day.
p21
aVOther people, when they see this picture,
p22
aVmight see gangs,
p23
aVthugs, delinquents \u2014
p24
aVcriminals.
p25
aVBut I see it different.
p26
aVI see these young people through a perspective
p27
aVthat looks at the assets that they bring to the education system.
p28
aVSo will you join me in changing the way we label young people
p29
aVfrom "at-risk" to "at-promise?"
p30
aa(lp31
V(Applause)
p32
aa(lp33
VHow do I know that these young people
p34
aVhave the potential and the promise to change?
p35
aVI know this because I am one of them.
p36
aVYou see, I grew up in dire poverty in the inner city,
p37
aVwithout a father \u2014
p38
aVhe abandoned me before I was even born.
p39
aVWe were on welfare,
p40
aVsometimes homeless,
p41
aVmany times hungry.
p42
aVBy the time I was 15 years old,
p43
aVI had been incarcerated in juvy three times for three felonies.
p44
aVMy best friend had already been killed.
p45
aVAnd soon after,
p46
aVwhile I'm standing next to my uncle,
p47
aVhe gets shot.
p48
aVAnd as I'm waiting for the ambulance to arrive
p49
aVfor over an hour ...
p50
aVhe bleeds to death on the street.
p51
aVI had lost faith and hope in the world,
p52
aVand I had given up on the system because the system had failed me.
p53
aVI had nothing to offer
p54
aVand no one had anything to offer me.
p55
aVI was fatalistic.
p56
aVI didn't even think I could make it to my 18th birthday.
p57
aa(lp58
VThe reason I'm here today
p59
aVis because a teacher that cared reached out
p60
aVand managed to tap into my soul.
p61
aVThis teacher,
p62
aVMs. Russ ...
p63
aVshe was the kind of teacher that was always in your business.
p64
aa(lp65
V(Laughter)
p66
aa(lp67
VShe was the kind of teacher that was like,
p68
aV"Victor, I'm here for you whenever you're ready."
p69
aa(lp70
V(Laughter)
p71
aa(lp72
VI wasn't ready.
p73
aVBut she understood one basic principle about young people like me.
p74
aVWe're like oysters.
p75
aVWe're only going to open up when we're ready,
p76
aVand if you're not there when we're ready,
p77
aVwe're going to clam back up.
p78
aVMs. Russ was there for me.
p79
aVShe was culturally relevant,
p80
aVshe respected my community, my people, my family.
p81
aVI told her a story about my Uncle Ruben.
p82
aVHe would take me to work with him because I was broke,
p83
aVand he knew I needed some money.
p84
aVHe collected glass bottles for a living.
p85
aVFour in the morning on a school day,
p86
aVwe'd throw the glass bottles in the back of his van,
p87
aVand the bottles would break.
p88
aVAnd my hands and arms would start to bleed
p89
aVand my tennis shoes and pants would get all bloody.
p90
aVAnd I was terrified and in pain, and I would stop working.
p91
aVAnd my uncle, he would look me in the eyes and he would say to me,
p92
aV"Mijo,
p93
aVestamos buscando vida."
p94
aV"We're searching for a better life,
p95
aVwe're trying to make something out of nothing."
p96
aa(lp97
VMs. Russ listened to my story,
p98
aVwelcomed it into the classroom and said,
p99
aV"Victor, this is your power.
p100
aVThis is your potential.
p101
aVYour family, your culture, your community have taught you a hard-work ethic
p102
aVand you will use it to empower yourself in the academic world
p103
aVso you can come back and empower your community."
p104
aa(lp105
VWith Ms. Russ's help,
p106
aVI ended up returning to school.
p107
aVI even finished my credits on time
p108
aVand graduated with my class.
p109
aa(lp110
V(Applause)
p111
aa(lp112
VBut Ms. Russ said to me right before graduation,
p113
aV"Victor, I'm so proud of you.
p114
aVI knew you could do it.
p115
aVNow it's time to go to college."
p116
aa(lp117
V(Laughter)
p118
aa(lp119
VCollege, me?
p120
aVMan, what is this teacher smoking thinking I'm going to college?
p121
aVI applied with the mentors and support she provided,
p122
aVgot a letter of acceptance,
p123
aVand one of the paragraphs read,
p124
aV"You've been admitted under probationary status."
p125
aVI said, "Probation? I'm already on probation,
p126
aVthat don't matter?"
p127
aa(lp128
V(Laughter)
p129
aa(lp130
VIt was academic probation, not criminal probation.
p131
aVBut what do teachers like Ms. Russ do to succeed with young people
p132
aVlike the ones I study?
p133
aVI propose three strategies.
p134
aVThe first:
p135
aVlet's get rid of our deficit perspective in education.
p136
aV"These people come from a culture of violence,
p137
aVa culture of poverty.
p138
aVThese people are at-risk; these people are truant.
p139
aVThese people are empty containers for us to fill with knowledge.
p140
aVThey have the problems,
p141
aVwe have the solutions."
p142
aVNumber two.
p143
aVLet's value the stories that young people bring to the schoolhouse.
p144
aVTheir stories of overcoming insurmountable odds are so powerful.
p145
aVAnd I know you know some of these stories.
p146
aVThese very same stories and experiences
p147
aValready have grit, character and resilience in them.
p148
aVSo let's help young people refine those stories.
p149
aVLet's help them be proud of who they are,
p150
aVbecause our education system welcomes their families, their cultures,
p151
aVtheir communities
p152
aVand the skill set they've learned to survive.
p153
aVAnd of course the third strategy being the most important:
p154
aVresources.
p155
aVWe have to provide adequate resources to young people.
p156
aVGrit alone isn't going to cut it.
p157
aVYou can sit there and tell me all you want,
p158
aV"Hey man, pick yourself up by the bootstraps."
p159
aVBut if I was born without any straps on my boots \u2014
p160
aa(lp161
V(Laughter)
p162
aa(lp163
VHow am I supposed to pick myself up?
p164
aa(lp165
V(Applause)
p166
aa(lp167
VJob training,
p168
aVmentoring,
p169
aVcounseling ...
p170
aVTeaching young people to learn from their mistakes
p171
aVinstead of criminalizing them,
p172
aVand dragging them out of their classrooms like animals.
p173
aVHow about this?
p174
aVI propose that we implement restorative justice in every high school in America.
p175
aa(lp176
V(Applause)
p177
aa(lp178
VSo we went out to test these ideas in the community of Watts in LA
p179
aVwith 40 young people that had been pushed out of school.
p180
aVWilliam was one of them.
p181
aVWilliam was the kind of kid that had been given every label.
p182
aVHe had dropped out, he was a gang member,
p183
aVa criminal.
p184
aVAnd when we met him he was very resistant.
p185
aVBut I remember what Ms. Russ used to say.
p186
aV"Hey, I'm here for you whenever you're ready."
p187
aa(lp188
V(Laughter)
p189
aa(lp190
VSo over time \u2014
p191
aVover time he began to open up.
p192
aVAnd I remember the day that he made the switch.
p193
aVWe were in a large group
p194
aVand a young lady in our program was crying
p195
aVbecause she told us her powerful story
p196
aVof her dad being killed
p197
aVand then his body being shown in the newspaper the next day.
p198
aVAnd as she's crying, I don't know what to do,
p199
aVso I give her her space,
p200
aVand William had enough.
p201
aVHe slammed his hands on the desk and he said,
p202
aV"Hey, everybody! Group hug! Group hug!"
p203
aa(lp204
V(Applause)
p205
aa(lp206
VThis young lady's tears and pain turned into joy and laughter
p207
aVknowing that her community had her back,
p208
aVand William had now learned that he did have a purpose in life:
p209
aVto help to heal the souls of people in his own community.
p210
aVHe told us his story.
p211
aVWe refined his story
p212
aVto go from being the story of a victim to being the story of a survivor
p213
aVthat has overcome adversity.
p214
aVWe placed high value on it.
p215
aVWilliam went on to finish high school,
p216
aVget his security guard certificate to become a security guard,
p217
aVand is now working at a local school district.
p218
aa(lp219
V(Applause)
p220
aa(lp221
VMs. Russ's mantra \u2014
p222
aVher mantra was always,
p223
aV"when you teach to the heart, the mind will follow."
p224
aVThe great writer Khalil Gibran says,
p225
aV"Out of suffering have emerged the greatest souls.
p226
aVThe massive characters are seared with scars."
p227
aVI believe that in this education revolution that we're talking about
p228
aVwe need to invite the souls of the young people that we work with,
p229
aVand once they're able to refine \u2014
p230
aVidentify their grit, resilience and character
p231
aVthat they've already developed \u2014
p232
aVtheir academic performance will improve.
p233
aa(lp234
VLet's believe in young people.
p235
aVLet's provide them the right kinds of resources.
p236
aVI'll tell you what my teacher did for me.
p237
aVShe believed in me so much
p238
aVthat she tricked me into believing in myself.
p239
aa(lp240
VThank you.
