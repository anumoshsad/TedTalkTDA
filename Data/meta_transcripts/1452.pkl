VSo, I'm going to start off with kind of the buzzkill a little bit.
p4
aVForty-two million people
p5
aVwere displaced by natural disasters in 2010.
p6
aVNow, there was nothing particularly special about 2010,
p7
aVbecause, on average, 31 and a half million people
p8
aVare displaced by natural disasters every single year.
p9
aVNow, usually when people hear statistics or stats like that,
p10
aVyou start thinking about places like Haiti or other kind of
p11
aVexotic or maybe even impoverished areas, but it happens
p12
aVright here in the United States every single year.
p13
aVLast year alone, 99 federally declared disasters
p14
aVwere on file with FEMA,
p15
aVfrom Joplin, Missouri, and Tuscaloosa, Alabama,
p16
aVto the Central Texas wildfires that just happened recently.
p17
aVNow, how does the most powerful country in the world
p18
aVhandle these displaced people?
p19
aVThey cram them onto cots, put all your personal belongings
p20
aVin a plastic garbage bag, stick it underneath,
p21
aVand put you on the floor of an entire sports arena,
p22
aVor a gymnasium.
p23
aa(lp24
VSo obviously there's a massive housing gap,
p25
aVand this really upset me, because academia tells you
p26
aVafter a major disaster, there's typically about
p27
aVan 18-month time frame to \u2014 we kinda recover,
p28
aVstart the recovery process,
p29
aVbut what most people don't realize is that on average
p30
aVit takes 45 to 60 days or more
p31
aVfor the infamous FEMA trailers to even begin to show up.
p32
aVBefore that time, people are left to their own devices.
p33
aa(lp34
VSo I became obsessed with trying to figure out a way
p35
aVto actually fill this gap.
p36
aVThis actually became my creative obsession.
p37
aVI put aside all my freelance work after hours and started
p38
aVjust focusing particularly on this problem.
p39
aa(lp40
VSo I started sketching.
p41
aVTwo days after Katrina, I started sketching and sketching
p42
aVand trying to brainstorm up ideas or solutions for this,
p43
aVand as things started to congeal or ideas started to form,
p44
aVI started sketching digitally on the computer,
p45
aVbut it was an obsession, so I couldn't just stop there.
p46
aVI started experimenting, making models,
p47
aVtalking to experts in the field, taking their feedback,
p48
aVand refining, and I kept on refining and refining
p49
aVfor nights and weekends for over five years.
p50
aa(lp51
VNow, my obsession ended up driving me to create
p52
aVfull-size prototypes in my own backyard \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p53
aVand actually spending my own personal savings on
p54
aVeverything from tooling to patents
p55
aVand a variety of other costs,
p56
aVbut in the end I ended up with this modular housing system
p57
aVthat can react to any situation or disaster.
p58
aVIt can be put up in any environment,
p59
aVfrom an asphalt parking lot to pastures or fields,
p60
aVbecause it doesn't require any special setup
p61
aVor specialty tools.
p62
aa(lp63
VNow, at the foundation and kind of the core
p64
aVof this whole system is the Exo Housing Unit,
p65
aVwhich is just the individual shelter module.
p66
aVAnd though it's light, light enough that you can actually
p67
aVlift it by hand and move it around,
p68
aVand it actually sleeps four people.
p69
aa(lp70
VAnd you can arrange these things as kind of more
p71
aVfor encampments and more of a city grid type layout,
p72
aVor you can circle the wagons, essentially,
p73
aVand form these circular pods out of them,
p74
aVwhich give you this semi-private communal area
p75
aVfor people to actually spill out into so they're not actually
p76
aVtrapped inside these units.
p77
aa(lp78
VNow this fundamentally changes
p79
aVthe way we respond to disasters,
p80
aVbecause gone are the horrid conditions
p81
aVinside a sports arena or a gymnasium, where people
p82
aVare crammed on these cots inside.
p83
aVNow we have instant neighborhoods outside.
p84
aa(lp85
VSo the Exo is designed to be simply, basically
p86
aVlike a coffee cup. They can actually stack together
p87
aVso we get extremely efficient transportation
p88
aVand storage out of them.
p89
aVIn fact, 15 Exos can fit on a single semi truck by itself.
p90
aVThis means the Exo can actually be transported and set up
p91
aVfaster than any other housing option available today.
p92
aVBut I'm obsessive, so I couldn't just stop there,
p93
aVso I actually started modifying the bunks where you could
p94
aVactually slide out the bunks and slide in desks or shelving,
p95
aVso the same unit can now be used
p96
aVfor an office or storage location.
p97
aVThe doors can actually swap out, so you can actually put on
p98
aVa rigid panel with a window unit in it for climate control,
p99
aVor a connector module that would allow you to actually
p100
aVconnect multiple units together, which gives you
p101
aVlarger and kind of compartmentalized living spaces,
p102
aVso now this same kit of parts, this same unit
p103
aVcan actually serve as a living room, bedroom or bathroom,
p104
aVor an office, a living space and secure storage.
p105
aa(lp106
VSounds like a great idea, but how do you make it real?
p107
aVSo the first idea I had, initially, was just
p108
aVto go the federal and state governments and go,
p109
aV"Here, take it, for free."
p110
aVBut I was quickly told that, "Boy, our government
p111
aVdoesn't really work like that." (Laughter)
p112
aVOkay. Okay. So maybe I would start a nonprofit
p113
aVto kind of help consult and get this idea going
p114
aValong with the government, but then I was told,
p115
aV"Son, our government looks to private sector
p116
aVfor things like this."
p117
aVOkay. So maybe I would take this whole idea and go
p118
aVto private corporations that would have this mutually shared
p119
aVbenefit to it, but I was quickly told by some corporations
p120
aVthat my personal passion project was not a brand fit
p121
aVbecause they didn't want their logos stamped
p122
aVacross the ghettos of Haiti.
p123
aa(lp124
VNow, I wasn't just obsessed. I was outraged. (Laughter.)
p125
aVSo I decided, kind of told myself,
p126
aV"Oh yeah? Watch this. I'll do it myself." (Laughter)
p127
aVNow, this quickly, my day job sent me to work out of
p128
aVour Milan office for a few months, so I was like,
p129
aVwhat will I do? So I actually scheduled sleep on my calendar,
p130
aVand spent the 8-hour time difference on conference calls
p131
aVwith material suppliers, manufacturers and potential customers.
p132
aVAnd we found through this whole process, we found
p133
aVthis great little manufacturer in Virginia,
p134
aVand if his body language is any indication,
p135
aVthat's the owner \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 of what it's like
p136
aVfor a manufacturer to work directly with a designer,
p137
aVyou've got to see what happens here. (Laughter)
p138
aa(lp139
VBut G.S. Industries was fantastic.
p140
aVThey actually built three prototypes for us by hand.
p141
aVSo now we have prototypes that can show that four people
p142
aVcan actually sleep securely and much more comfortably
p143
aVthan a tent could ever provide.
p144
aVAnd they actually shipped them here to Texas for us.
p145
aVNow, a funny thing started happening.
p146
aVOther people started to believe in what we were doing,
p147
aVand actually offered us hangar space, donated hangar
p148
aVspace to us. And then the Georgetown Airport Authority
p149
aVwas bent over backwards to help us with anything we needed.
p150
aVSo now we had a hangar space to work in,
p151
aVand prototypes to demo with.
p152
aa(lp153
VSo in one year, we've negotiated manufacturing agreements,
p154
aVbeen awarded one patent, filed our second patent,
p155
aVtalked to multiple people, demoed this to FEMA
p156
aVand its consultants to rave reviews,
p157
aVand then started talking to some other people who requested
p158
aVinformation, this little group called the United Nations.
p159
aVAnd on top of that, now we have
p160
aVa whole plethora of other individuals that have come up
p161
aVand started to talk to us from doing it for mining camps,
p162
aVmobile youth hostels, right down to the World Cup
p163
aVand the Olympics.
p164
aVSo, in closing, on this whole thing here
p165
aVis hopefully very soon we will not have to
p166
aVrespond to these painful phone calls that we get
p167
aVafter disasters where we don't really have anything
p168
aVto sell or give you yet.
p169
aVHopefully very soon we will be there,
p170
aVbecause we are destined,
p171
aVobsessed with making it real.
p172
aVThank you. (Applause)
