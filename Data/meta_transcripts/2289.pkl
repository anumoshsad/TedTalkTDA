VThis is my great uncle,
p4
aVmy father's father's younger brother.
p5
aVHis name was Joe McKenna.
p6
aVHe was a young husband and a semi-pro basketball player
p7
aVand a fireman in New York City.
p8
aVFamily history says he loved being a fireman,
p9
aVand so in 1938, on one of his days off,
p10
aVhe elected to hang out at the firehouse.
p11
aVTo make himself useful that day, he started polishing all the brass,
p12
aVthe railings on the fire truck, the fittings on the walls,
p13
aVand one of the fire hose nozzles,
p14
aVa giant, heavy piece of metal,
p15
aVtoppled off a shelf and hit him.
p16
aVA few days later, his shoulder started to hurt.
p17
aVTwo days after that, he spiked a fever.
p18
aVThe fever climbed and climbed.
p19
aVHis wife was taking care of him,
p20
aVbut nothing she did made a difference, and when they got the local doctor in,
p21
aVnothing he did mattered either.
p22
aa(lp23
VThey flagged down a cab and took him to the hospital.
p24
aVThe nurses there recognized right away that he had an infection,
p25
aVwhat at the time they would have called "blood poisoning,"
p26
aVand though they probably didn't say it,
p27
aVthey would have known right away
p28
aVthat there was nothing they could do.
p29
aa(lp30
VThere was nothing they could do because the things we use now
p31
aVto cure infections didn't exist yet.
p32
aVThe first test of penicillin, the first antibiotic,
p33
aVwas three years in the future.
p34
aVPeople who got infections either recovered, if they were lucky,
p35
aVor they died.
p36
aVMy great uncle was not lucky.
p37
aVHe was in the hospital for a week, shaking with chills,
p38
aVdehydrated and delirious,
p39
aVsinking into a coma as his organs failed.
p40
aVHis condition grew so desperate
p41
aVthat the people from his firehouse lined up to give him transfusions
p42
aVhoping to dilute the infection surging through his blood.
p43
aa(lp44
VNothing worked. He died.
p45
aVHe was 30 years old.
p46
aa(lp47
VIf you look back through history,
p48
aVmost people died the way my great uncle died.
p49
aVMost people didn't die of cancer or heart disease,
p50
aVthe lifestyle diseases that afflict us in the West today.
p51
aVThey didn't die of those diseases because they didn't live long enough
p52
aVto develop them.
p53
aVThey died of injuries \u2014
p54
aVbeing gored by an ox,
p55
aVshot on a battlefield,
p56
aVcrushed in one of the new factories of the Industrial Revolution \u2014
p57
aVand most of the time from infection,
p58
aVwhich finished what those injuries began.
p59
aa(lp60
VAll of that changed when antibiotics arrived.
p61
aVSuddenly, infections that had been a death sentence
p62
aVbecame something you recovered from in days.
p63
aVIt seemed like a miracle,
p64
aVand ever since, we have been living inside the golden epoch of the miracle drugs.
p65
aa(lp66
VAnd now, we are coming to an end of it.
p67
aVMy great uncle died in the last days of the pre-antibiotic era.
p68
aVWe stand today on the threshold of the post-antibiotic era,
p69
aVin the earliest days of a time when simple infections
p70
aVsuch as the one Joe had will kill people once again.
p71
aa(lp72
VIn fact, they already are.
p73
aVPeople are dying of infections again because of a phenomenon
p74
aVcalled antibiotic resistance.
p75
aVBriefly, it works like this.
p76
aVBacteria compete against each other for resources, for food,
p77
aVby manufacturing lethal compounds that they direct against each other.
p78
aVOther bacteria, to protect themselves,
p79
aVevolve defenses against that chemical attack.
p80
aVWhen we first made antibiotics,
p81
aVwe took those compounds into the lab and made our own versions of them,
p82
aVand bacteria responded to our attack the way they always had.
p83
aa(lp84
VHere is what happened next:
p85
aVPenicillin was distributed in 1943,
p86
aVand widespread penicillin resistance arrived by 1945.
p87
aVVancomycin arrived in 1972,
p88
aVvancomycin resistance in 1988.
p89
aVImipenem in 1985,
p90
aVand resistance to in 1998.
p91
aVDaptomycin, one of the most recent drugs, in 2003,
p92
aVand resistance to it just a year later in 2004.
p93
aa(lp94
VFor 70 years, we played a game of leapfrog \u2014
p95
aVour drug and their resistance,
p96
aVand then another drug, and then resistance again \u2014
p97
aVand now the game is ending.
p98
aVBacteria develop resistance so quickly that pharmaceutical companies
p99
aVhave decided making antibiotics is not in their best interest,
p100
aVso there are infections moving across the world
p101
aVfor which, out of the more than 100 antibiotics
p102
aVavailable on the market,
p103
aVtwo drugs might work with side effects,
p104
aVor one drug,
p105
aVor none.
p106
aa(lp107
VThis is what that looks like.
p108
aVIn 2000, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC,
p109
aVidentified a single case
p110
aVin a hospital in North Carolina
p111
aVof an infection resistant to all but two drugs.
p112
aVToday, that infection, known as KPC,
p113
aVhas spread to every state but three,
p114
aVand to South America, Europe
p115
aVand the Middle East.
p116
aVIn 2008, doctors in Sweden
p117
aVdiagnosed a man from India with a different infection
p118
aVresistant to all but one drug that time.
p119
aVThe gene that creates that resistance,
p120
aVknown as NDM, has now spread from India into China, Asia, Africa,
p121
aVEurope and Canada, and the United States.
p122
aa(lp123
VIt would be natural to hope
p124
aVthat these infections are extraordinary cases,
p125
aVbut in fact,
p126
aVin the United States and Europe,
p127
aV50,000 people a year
p128
aVdie of infections which no drugs can help.
p129
aVA project chartered by the British government
p130
aVknown as the Review on Antimicrobial Resistance
p131
aVestimates that the worldwide toll right now is 700,000 deaths a year.
p132
aa(lp133
VThat is a lot of deaths,
p134
aVand yet, the chances are good that you don't feel at risk,
p135
aVthat you imagine these people were hospital patients
p136
aVin intensive care units
p137
aVor nursing home residents near the ends of their lives,
p138
aVpeople whose infections are remote from us,
p139
aVin situations we can't identify with.
p140
aa(lp141
VWhat you didn't think about, none of us do,
p142
aVis that antibiotics support almost all of modern life.
p143
aa(lp144
VIf we lost antibiotics,
p145
aVhere's what else we'd lose:
p146
aVFirst, any protection for people with weakened immune systems \u2014
p147
aVcancer patients, AIDS patients,
p148
aVtransplant recipients, premature babies.
p149
aa(lp150
VNext, any treatment that installs foreign objects in the body:
p151
aVstents for stroke, pumps for diabetes,
p152
aVdialysis, joint replacements.
p153
aVHow many athletic baby boomers need new hips and knees?
p154
aVA recent study estimates that without antibiotics,
p155
aVone out of ever six would die.
p156
aa(lp157
VNext, we'd probably lose surgery.
p158
aVMany operations are preceded
p159
aVby prophylactic doses of antibiotics.
p160
aVWithout that protection,
p161
aVwe'd lose the ability to open the hidden spaces of the body.
p162
aVSo no heart operations,
p163
aVno prostate biopsies,
p164
aVno Cesarean sections.
p165
aVWe'd have to learn to fear infections that now seem minor.
p166
aVStrep throat used to cause heart failure.
p167
aVSkin infections led to amputations.
p168
aVGiving birth killed, in the cleanest hospitals,
p169
aValmost one woman out of every 100.
p170
aVPneumonia took three children out of every 10.
p171
aa(lp172
VMore than anything else,
p173
aVwe'd lose the confident way we live our everyday lives.
p174
aVIf you knew that any injury could kill you,
p175
aVwould you ride a motorcycle,
p176
aVbomb down a ski slope,
p177
aVclimb a ladder to hang your Christmas lights,
p178
aVlet your kid slide into home plate?
p179
aVAfter all, the first person to receive penicillin,
p180
aVa British policeman named Albert Alexander,
p181
aVwho was so ravaged by infection that his scalp oozed pus
p182
aVand doctors had to take out an eye,
p183
aVwas infected by doing something very simple.
p184
aVHe walked into his garden and scratched his face on a thorn.
p185
aVThat British project I mentioned which estimates that the worldwide toll
p186
aVright now is 700,000 deaths a year
p187
aValso predicts that if we can't get this under control by 2050,
p188
aVnot long, the worldwide toll will be 10 million deaths a year.
p189
aa(lp190
VHow did we get to this point
p191
aVwhere what we have to look forward to
p192
aVis those terrifying numbers?
p193
aVThe difficult answer is, we did it to ourselves.
p194
aVResistance is an inevitable biological process,
p195
aVbut we bear the responsibility for accelerating it.
p196
aVWe did this by squandering antibiotics
p197
aVwith a heedlessness that now seems shocking.
p198
aVPenicillin was sold over the counter until the 1950s.
p199
aVIn much of the developing world, most antibiotics still are.
p200
aVIn the United States, 50 percent
p201
aVof the antibiotics given in hospitals are unnecessary.
p202
aVForty-five percent of the prescriptions written in doctor's offices
p203
aVare for conditions that antibiotics cannot help.
p204
aVAnd that's just in healthcare.
p205
aVOn much of the planet, most meat animals get antibiotics every day of their lives,
p206
aVnot to cure illnesses,
p207
aVbut to fatten them up and to protect them against
p208
aVthe factory farm conditions they are raised in.
p209
aVIn the United States, possibly 80 percent
p210
aVof the antibiotics sold every year go to farm animals, not to humans,
p211
aVcreating resistant bacteria that move off the farm
p212
aVin water, in dust,
p213
aVin the meat the animals become.
p214
aVAquaculture depends on antibiotics too,
p215
aVparticularly in Asia,
p216
aVand fruit growing relies on antibiotics
p217
aVto protect apples, pears, citrus, against disease.
p218
aVAnd because bacteria can pass their DNA to each other
p219
aVlike a traveler handing off a suitcase at an airport,
p220
aVonce we have encouraged that resistance into existence,
p221
aVthere is no knowing where it will spread.
p222
aa(lp223
VThis was predictable.
p224
aVIn fact, it was predicted
p225
aVby Alexander Fleming, the man who discovered penicillin.
p226
aVHe was given the Nobel Prize in 1945 in recognition,
p227
aVand in an interview shortly after, this is what he said:
p228
aa(lp229
V"The thoughtless person playing with penicillin treatment
p230
aVis morally responsible for the death of a man
p231
aVwho succumbs to infection
p232
aVwith a pencillin-resistant organism."
p233
aVHe added, "I hope this evil can be averted."
p234
aa(lp235
VCan we avert it?
p236
aVThere are companies working on novel antibiotics,
p237
aVthings the superbugs have never seen before.
p238
aVWe need those new drugs badly,
p239
aVand we need incentives:
p240
aVdiscovery grants, extended patents,
p241
aVprizes, to lure other companies into making antibiotics again.
p242
aa(lp243
VBut that probably won't be enough.
p244
aVHere's why: Evolution always wins.
p245
aVBacteria birth a new generation every 20 minutes.
p246
aVIt takes pharmaceutical chemistry 10 years to derive a new drug.
p247
aVEvery time we use an antibiotic,
p248
aVwe give the bacteria billions of chances
p249
aVto crack the codes
p250
aVof the defenses we've constructed.
p251
aVThere has never yet been a drug
p252
aVthey could not defeat.
p253
aa(lp254
VThis is asymmetric warfare,
p255
aVbut we can change the outcome.
p256
aVWe could build systems to harvest data to tell us automatically and specifically
p257
aVhow antibiotics are being used.
p258
aVWe could build gatekeeping into drug order systems
p259
aVso that every prescription gets a second look.
p260
aVWe could require agriculture to give up antibiotic use.
p261
aVWe could build surveillance systems
p262
aVto tell us where resistance is emerging next.
p263
aa(lp264
VThose are the tech solutions.
p265
aVThey probably aren't enough either,
p266
aVunless we help.
p267
aVAntibiotic resistance is a habit.
p268
aVWe all know how hard it is to change a habit.
p269
aVBut as a society, we've done that in the past.
p270
aVPeople used to toss litter into the streets,
p271
aVused to not wear seatbelts,
p272
aVused to smoke inside public buildings.
p273
aVWe don't do those things anymore.
p274
aVWe don't trash the environment
p275
aVor court devastating accidents
p276
aVor expose others to the possibility of cancer,
p277
aVbecause we decided those things were expensive,
p278
aVdestructive, not in our best interest.
p279
aVWe changed social norms.
p280
aVWe could change social norms around antibiotic use too.
p281
aa(lp282
VI know that the scale of antibiotic resistance
p283
aVseems overwhelming,
p284
aVbut if you've ever bought a fluorescent lightbulb
p285
aVbecause you were concerned about climate change,
p286
aVor read the label on a box of crackers
p287
aVbecause you think about the deforestation from palm oil,
p288
aVyou already know what it feels like
p289
aVto take a tiny step to address an overwhelming problem.
p290
aVWe could take those kinds of steps for antibiotic use too.
p291
aVWe could forgo giving an antibiotic if we're not sure it's the right one.
p292
aVWe could stop insisting on a prescription for our kid's ear infection
p293
aVbefore we're sure what caused it.
p294
aVWe could ask every restaurant,
p295
aVevery supermarket,
p296
aVwhere their meat comes from.
p297
aVWe could promise each other
p298
aVnever again to buy chicken or shrimp or fruit
p299
aVraised with routine antibiotic use,
p300
aVand if we did those things,
p301
aVwe could slow down the arrival of the post-antibiotic world.
p302
aa(lp303
VBut we have to do it soon.
p304
aVPenicillin began the antibiotic era in 1943.
p305
aVIn just 70 years, we walked ourselves up to the edge of disaster.
p306
aVWe won't get 70 years
p307
aVto find our way back out again.
