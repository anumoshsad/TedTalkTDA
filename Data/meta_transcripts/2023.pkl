VThink of a hard choice you'll face in the near future.
p4
aVIt might be between two careers \u2014
p5
aVartist and accountant \u2014
p6
aVor places to live \u2014 the city or the country \u2014
p7
aVor even between two people to marry \u2014
p8
aVyou could marry Betty or you could marry Lolita.
p9
aVOr it might be a choice about whether to have children,
p10
aVto have an ailing parent move in with you,
p11
aVto raise your child in a religion that your partner lives by
p12
aVbut leaves you cold.
p13
aVOr whether to donate your life savings to charity.
p14
aa(lp15
VChances are, the hard choice you thought of was something big,
p16
aVsomething momentous, something that matters to you.
p17
aVHard choices seem to be occasions
p18
aVfor agonizing, hand-wringing, the gnashing of teeth.
p19
aVBut I think we've misunderstood hard choices
p20
aVand the role they play in our lives.
p21
aVUnderstanding hard choices
p22
aVuncovers a hidden power each of us possesses.
p23
aa(lp24
VWhat makes a choice hard is the way the alternatives relate.
p25
aVIn any easy choice,
p26
aVone alternative is better than the other.
p27
aVIn a hard choice,
p28
aVone alternative is better in some ways,
p29
aVthe other alternative is better in other ways,
p30
aVand neither is better than the other overall.
p31
aVYou agonize over whether to stay in your current job in the city
p32
aVor uproot your life for more challenging work in the country,
p33
aVbecause staying is better in some ways,
p34
aVmoving is better in others,
p35
aVand neither is better than the other overall.
p36
aa(lp37
VWe shouldn't think that all hard choices are big.
p38
aVLet's say you're deciding what to have for breakfast.
p39
aVYou could have high fiber bran cereal
p40
aVor a chocolate donut.
p41
aVSuppose what matters in the choice is tastiness and healthfulness.
p42
aVThe cereal is better for you,
p43
aVthe donut tastes way better,
p44
aVbut neither is better than the other overall,
p45
aVa hard choice.
p46
aVRealizing that small choices can also be hard,
p47
aVmay make big hard choices seem less intractable.
p48
aVAfter all, we manage to figure out what to have for breakfast,
p49
aVso maybe we can figure out whether to stay in the city
p50
aVor uproot for the new job in the country.
p51
aa(lp52
VWe also shouldn't think that hard choices are hard
p53
aVbecause we are stupid.
p54
aVWhen I graduated from college,
p55
aVI couldn't decide between two careers, philosophy and law.
p56
aVI really loved philosophy.
p57
aVThere are amazing things you can learn as a philosopher,
p58
aVand all from the comfort of an armchair.
p59
aVBut I came from a modest immigrant family
p60
aVwhere my idea of luxury
p61
aVwas having a pork tongue and jelly sandwich
p62
aVin my school lunchbox,
p63
aVso the thought of spending my whole life
p64
aVsitting around in armchairs just thinking ...
p65
aVWell, that struck me as the height of extravagance and frivolity.
p66
aVSo I got out my yellow pad,
p67
aVI drew a line down the middle,
p68
aVand I tried my best to think of the reasons
p69
aVfor and against each alternative.
p70
aVI remember thinking to myself,
p71
aVif only I knew what my life in each career would be like.
p72
aVIf only God or Netflix would send me a DVD of my two possible future careers,
p73
aVI'd be set.
p74
aVI'd compare them side by side,
p75
aVI'd see that one was better,
p76
aVand the choice would be easy.
p77
aa(lp78
VBut I got no DVD,
p79
aVand because I couldn't figure out which was better,
p80
aVI did what many of us do in hard choices:
p81
aVI took the safest option.
p82
aVFear of being an unemployed philosopher led me to become a lawyer,
p83
aVand as I discovered, lawyering didn't quite fit.
p84
aVIt wasn't who I was.
p85
aVSo now I'm a philosopher,
p86
aVand I study hard choices,
p87
aVand I can tell you, that fear of the unknown,
p88
aVwhile a common motivational default in dealing with hard choices,
p89
aVrests on a misconception of them.
p90
aVIt's a mistake to think that in hard choices,
p91
aVone alternative really is better than the other,
p92
aVbut we're too stupid to know which,
p93
aVand since we don't know which,
p94
aVwe might as well take the least risky option.
p95
aVEven taking two alternatives side by side
p96
aVwith full information, a choice can still be hard.
p97
aVHard choices are hard not because of us or our ignorance;
p98
aVthey're hard because there is no best option.
p99
aa(lp100
VNow, if there's no best option,
p101
aVif the scales don't tip in favor of one alternative over another,
p102
aVthen surely the alternatives must be equally good.
p103
aVSo maybe the right thing to say in hard choices
p104
aVis that they're between equally good options.
p105
aVBut that can't be right.
p106
aVIf alternatives are equally good, you should just flip a coin between them,
p107
aVand it seems a mistake to think,
p108
aVhere's how you should decide between careers,
p109
aVplaces to live, people to marry:
p110
aVFlip a coin.
p111
aa(lp112
VThere's another reason for thinking
p113
aVthat hard choices aren't choices between equally good options.
p114
aVSuppose you have a choice between two jobs:
p115
aVyou could be an investment banker
p116
aVor a graphic artist.
p117
aVThere are a variety of things that matter in such a choice,
p118
aVlike the excitement of the work,
p119
aVachieving financial security,
p120
aVhaving time to raise a family, and so on.
p121
aVMaybe the artist's career puts you on the cutting edge
p122
aVof new forms of pictorial expression.
p123
aVMaybe the banking career puts you on the cutting edge
p124
aVof new forms of financial manipulation.
p125
aa(lp126
V(Laughter)
p127
aa(lp128
VImagine the two jobs however you like,
p129
aVso that neither is better than the other.
p130
aa(lp131
VNow suppose we improve one of them, a bit.
p132
aVSuppose the bank, wooing you,
p133
aVadds 500 dollars a month to your salary.
p134
aVDoes the extra money
p135
aVnow make the banking job better than the artist one?
p136
aVNot necessarily.
p137
aVA higher salary makes the banking job better than it was before,
p138
aVbut it might not be enough
p139
aVto make being a banker better than being an artist.
p140
aVBut if an improvement in one of the jobs doesn't make it better than the other,
p141
aVthen the two original jobs could not have been equally good.
p142
aVIf you start with two things that are equally good,
p143
aVand you improve one of them,
p144
aVit now must be better than the other.
p145
aVThat's not the case with options in hard choices.
p146
aa(lp147
VSo now we've got a puzzle.
p148
aVWe've got two jobs.
p149
aVNeither is better than the other, nor are they equally good.
p150
aVSo how are we supposed to choose?
p151
aVSomething seems to have gone wrong here.
p152
aVMaybe the choice itself is problematic, and comparison is impossible.
p153
aVBut that can't be right.
p154
aVIt's not like we're trying to choose between two things that can't be compared.
p155
aVWe're weighing the merits of two jobs, after all,
p156
aVnot the merits of the number nine and a plate of fried eggs.
p157
aVA comparison of the overall merits of two jobs
p158
aVis something we can make,
p159
aVand one we often do make.
p160
aa(lp161
VI think the puzzle arises
p162
aVbecause of an unreflective assumption we make about value.
p163
aVWe unwittingly assume that values like justice, beauty, kindness,
p164
aVare akin to scientific quantities, like length, mass and weight.
p165
aVTake any comparative question not involving value,
p166
aVsuch as which of two suitcases is heavier.
p167
aVThere are only three possibilities.
p168
aVThe weight of one is greater, lesser or equal to the weight of the other.
p169
aVProperties like weight can be represented by real numbers \u2014
p170
aVone, two, three and so on \u2014
p171
aVand there are only three possible comparisons
p172
aVbetween any two real numbers.
p173
aVOne number is greater, lesser, or equal to the other.
p174
aVNot so with values.
p175
aVAs post-Enlightenment creatures,
p176
aVwe tend to assume
p177
aVthat scientific thinking holds the key to everything of importance in our world,
p178
aVbut the world of value is different from the world of science.
p179
aVThe stuff of the one world can be quantified by real numbers.
p180
aVThe stuff of the other world can't.
p181
aVWe shouldn't assume that the world of is, of lengths and weights,
p182
aVhas the same structure as the world of ought,
p183
aVof what we should do.
p184
aa(lp185
VSo if what matters to us \u2014
p186
aVa child's delight, the love you have for your partner \u2014
p187
aVcan't be represented by real numbers,
p188
aVthen there's no reason to believe
p189
aVthat in choice, there are only three possibilities \u2014
p190
aVthat one alternative is better, worse or equal to the other.
p191
aVWe need to introduce a new, fourth relation
p192
aVbeyond being better, worse or equal,
p193
aVthat describes what's going on in hard choices.
p194
aVI like to say that the alternatives are "on a par."
p195
aVWhen alternatives are on a par,
p196
aVit may matter very much which you choose,
p197
aVbut one alternative isn't better than the other.
p198
aVRather, the alternatives are in the same neighborhood of value,
p199
aVin the same league of value,
p200
aVwhile at the same time being very different in kind of value.
p201
aVThat's why the choice is hard.
p202
aa(lp203
VUnderstanding hard choices in this way
p204
aVuncovers something about ourselves we didn't know.
p205
aVEach of us has the power to create reasons.
p206
aVImagine a world in which every choice you face
p207
aVis an easy choice,
p208
aVthat is, there's always a best alternative.
p209
aVIf there's a best alternative, then that's the one you should choose,
p210
aVbecause part of being rational
p211
aVis doing the better thing rather than the worse thing,
p212
aVchoosing what you have most reason to choose.
p213
aVIn such a world,
p214
aVwe'd have most reason
p215
aVto wear black socks instead of pink socks,
p216
aVto eat cereal instead of donuts,
p217
aVto live in the city rather than the country,
p218
aVto marry Betty instead of Lolita.
p219
aVA world full of only easy choices would enslave us to reasons.
p220
aa(lp221
VWhen you think about it,
p222
aa(lp223
V(Laughter)
p224
aa(lp225
Vit's nuts to believe that the reasons given to you
p226
aVdictated that you had most reason to pursue
p227
aVthe exact hobbies you do,
p228
aVto live in the exact house you do,
p229
aVto work at the exact job you do.
p230
aVInstead, you faced alternatives that were on a par \u2014
p231
aVhard choices \u2014
p232
aVand you made reasons for yourself
p233
aVto choose that hobby, that house and that job.
p234
aVWhen alternatives are on a par,
p235
aVthe reasons given to us,
p236
aVthe ones that determine whether we're making a mistake,
p237
aVare silent as to what to do.
p238
aVIt's here, in the space of hard choices,
p239
aVthat we get to exercise our normative power \u2014
p240
aVthe power to create reasons for yourself,
p241
aVto make yourself into the kind of person
p242
aVfor whom country living is preferable to the urban life.
p243
aa(lp244
VWhen we choose between options that are on a par,
p245
aVwe can do something really rather remarkable.
p246
aVWe can put our very selves behind an option.
p247
aVHere's where I stand.
p248
aVHere's who I am, I am for banking.
p249
aVI am for chocolate donuts.
p250
aa(lp251
V(Laughter)
p252
aa(lp253
VThis response in hard choices is a rational response,
p254
aVbut it's not dictated by reasons given to us.
p255
aVRather, it's supported by reasons created by us.
p256
aVWhen we create reasons for ourselves
p257
aVto become this kind of person rather than that,
p258
aVwe wholeheartedly become the people that we are.
p259
aVYou might say that we become the authors of our own lives.
p260
aa(lp261
VSo when we face hard choices, we shouldn't beat our head against a wall
p262
aVtrying to figure out which alternative is better.
p263
aVThere is no best alternative.
p264
aVInstead of looking for reasons out there,
p265
aVwe should be looking for reasons in here:
p266
aVWho am I to be?
p267
aVYou might decide to be a pink sock-wearing,
p268
aVcereal-loving, country-living banker,
p269
aVand I might decide to be a black sock-wearing,
p270
aVurban, donut-loving artist.
p271
aVWhat we do in hard choices is very much up to each of us.
p272
aa(lp273
VNow, people who don't exercise their normative powers in hard choices
p274
aVare drifters.
p275
aVWe all know people like that.
p276
aVI drifted into being a lawyer.
p277
aVI didn't put my agency behind lawyering.
p278
aVI wasn't for lawyering.
p279
aVDrifters allow the world to write the story of their lives.
p280
aVThey let mechanisms of reward and punishment \u2014
p281
aVpats on the head, fear, the easiness of an option \u2014
p282
aVto determine what they do.
p283
aVSo the lesson of hard choices:
p284
aVreflect on what you can put your agency behind,
p285
aVon what you can be for,
p286
aVand through hard choices,
p287
aVbecome that person.
p288
aa(lp289
VFar from being sources of agony and dread,
p290
aVhard choices are precious opportunities
p291
aVfor us to celebrate what is special about the human condition,
p292
aVthat the reasons that govern our choices as correct or incorrect
p293
aVsometimes run out,
p294
aVand it is here, in the space of hard choices,
p295
aVthat we have the power to create reasons for ourselves
p296
aVto become the distinctive people that we are.
p297
aVAnd that's why hard choices are not a curse
p298
aVbut a godsend.
p299
