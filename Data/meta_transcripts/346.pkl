VWe really need to put the best we have to offer within reach of our children.
p4
aVIf we don't do that, we're going to get the generation we deserve.
p5
aVThey're going to learn from whatever it is they have around them.
p6
aa(lp7
VAnd we, as now the elite, parents, librarians, professionals, whatever it is,
p8
aVa bunch of our activities are, in fact, in trying to get the best we have to offer
p9
aVwithin reach of those around us, or as broadly as we can.
p10
aVI'm going to start and end this talk with a couple things that are carved in stone.
p11
aVOne is what's on the Boston Public Library.
p12
aVCarved above their door is, "Free to All."
p13
aVIt's kind of an inspiring statement,
p14
aVand I'll go back at the end of this.
p15
aVI'm a librarian, and what I'm trying to do is bring all of the works of knowledge
p16
aVto as many people as want to read it.
p17
aVAnd the idea of using technology is perfect for us.
p18
aVI think we have the opportunity to one-up the Greeks.
p19
aVIt's not easy to one-up the Greeks. But with the industriousness of the Egyptians,
p20
aVthey were able to build the Library of Alexandria \u2014
p21
aVthe idea of a copy of every book of all the peoples of the world.
p22
aVThe problem was you actually had to go to Alexandria to go to it.
p23
aVOn the other hand, if you did, then great things happened.
p24
aVI think we can one-up the Greeks and achieve something.
p25
aVAnd I'm going to try to argue only one point today:
p26
aVthat universal access to all knowledge is within our grasp.
p27
aVSo if I'm successful, then you'll actually come away thinking,
p28
aVyeah, we could actually achieve the great vision of everything ever published,
p29
aVeverything that was ever meant for distribution,
p30
aVavailable to anybody in the world that's ever wanted to have access to it.
p31
aa(lp32
VYes, there's issues about how money should be distributed,
p33
aVand that's still being refigured out.
p34
aVBut I'd say there's plenty of money, and there's plenty of demand,
p35
aVso we can actually achieve that.
p36
aVBut I'm going to go over the technological, social
p37
aVand sort of where are we as a whole, trying to get to that particular vision.
p38
aVAnd the way I'm going to try to do this is do it like the Amazon.com website,
p39
aVthe books, music, video and just go step \u2014 media type by media type,
p40
aVjust go and say, all right, how're we doing on this?
p41
aa(lp42
VSo if we start with books, you know, sort of where are we?
p43
aVWell, first you have to, as an engineer, scope the problem. How big is it?
p44
aVIf you wanted to put all of the published works online
p45
aVso that anybody could have it available, well, how big a problem is it?
p46
aVWell, we don't really know, but the largest print library in the world
p47
aVis the Library of Congress. It's 26 million volumes, 26 million volumes.
p48
aVIt is, by far and away, the largest print library in the world.
p49
aVAnd a book, if you had a book, is about a megabyte,
p50
aVso \u2014 you know, if you had it in Microsoft Word.
p51
aVSo a megabyte, 26 million megabytes is 26 terabytes \u2014
p52
aVit goes mega-, giga-, tera-. 26 terabytes.
p53
aV26 terabytes fits in a computer system that's about this big,
p54
aVon spinning Linux drives, and it costs about 60,000 dollars.
p55
aVSo for the cost of a house \u2014 or around here, a garage \u2014
p56
aVyou can put, you can have spinning all of the words in the Library of Congress.
p57
aVThat's pretty neat.
p58
aa(lp59
VThen the question is, what do you get?
p60
aVYou know, is it worth trying to get there?
p61
aVDo you actually want it online?
p62
aVSome of the first things that people do is they make book readers
p63
aVthat allow you to search inside the books, and that's kind of fun.
p64
aVAnd you can download these things, and look around them in new and different ways.
p65
aVAnd you can get at them remotely, if you happen to have a laptop.
p66
aVThere's starting to be some of these sort of page turn-y interfaces
p67
aVthat look a whole lot like books in certain ways,
p68
aVand you can search them, make little tabs, and it's kind of cute \u2014
p69
aVstill very book-like \u2014 on your laptop.
p70
aVBut I don't know, reading things on a laptop \u2014
p71
aVwhenever I pull up my laptop, it always feels like work.
p72
aVI think that's one of the reasons why the Kindle is so great.
p73
aVI don't have to feel like I'm at work to read a Kindle.
p74
aVIt's starting to be a little bit more specified.
p75
aVBut I have to say that there's older technologies that I tend to like.
p76
aVI like the physical book.
p77
aVAnd I think we can go and use our technology to go and digitize things,
p78
aVput them on the Net, and then download,
p79
aVprint them and bind them, and end up with books again.
p80
aa(lp81
VAnd we sort of said, well, how hard is this?
p82
aVAnd it turns out to not be very hard.
p83
aVWe actually went off to make a bookmobile.
p84
aVAnd a bookmobile \u2014 the size of a van with a satellite dish,
p85
aVa printer, binder and cutter, and kids make their own books.
p86
aVIt costs about three dollars to download, print and bind a normal, old book.
p87
aVAnd they actually come out kind of nice looking.
p88
aVYou can actually get really good-looking books
p89
aVfor on the order of one penny per page, sort of the parts cost for doing this.
p90
aa(lp91
VSo the idea of \u2014 this technology actually may end up
p92
aVputting books back in people's hands again.
p93
aVThere are some other bookmobiles running around.
p94
aVThis is Eric Eldred making books at Walden Pond \u2014 Thoreau's works.
p95
aVThis is just before he got kicked out by the Parks Services,
p96
aVfor competing with the bookstore there.
p97
aVIn India, they've got another couple bookmobiles running around.
p98
aVAnd this is the opening day at the Library of Alexandria,
p99
aVthe new Library of Alexandria, in Egypt.
p100
aVIt was quite popularly attended.
p101
aVAnd kids starting to make their own books,
p102
aVand a happy kid with the first book that he's ever owned.
p103
aVSo the idea of being able to use this technology
p104
aVto end up with paper where I can handle sort of sounds a little retro,
p105
aVbut I think it still has its place.
p106
aVAnd being from the Silicon Valley, sort of utopian
p107
aVsort of world,
p108
aVwe thought, if we can make this technology work in rural Uganda,
p109
aVwe might have something.
p110
aVSo we actually got some funding from the World Bank to try it out.
p111
aVAnd we found in about 30 days we could go and take a couple folks from Silicon Valley,
p112
aVfly them to Uganda, buy a car, set up the first Internet connection
p113
aVat the National Library of Uganda, figure out what they wanted,
p114
aVand get a program going making books in rural Uganda.
p115
aVAnd it actually \u2014 so technologically, it works.
p116
aa(lp117
VWhat we found out of this is we didn't have the right books.
p118
aVSo the books were in the library. We could get it to people, if they're digitized,
p119
aVbut we didn't know how to quite get them digitized.
p120
aVEverybody thought the answer is, send things to India and China.
p121
aVAnd so we've tried that, and I'll go over that in a moment.
p122
aVThere are some newer technologies for delivering
p123
aVthat have happened that are actually quite exciting as well.
p124
aVOne is a print-on-demand machine that looks like a Rube Goldberg machine.
p125
aVWe have one of these things now. It's completely cool.
p126
aVIt's all conveyor belt, and it makes a book.
p127
aVAnd it's called the "Espresso Book Machine,"
p128
aVand in about 10 minutes, you can press a button and make a book.
p129
aa(lp130
VSomething else I'm quite excited about in this particular domain,
p131
aVbeyond these sort of kiosk-y things where you can get books on demand,
p132
aVis some of these new little screens that are coming out.
p133
aVAnd one of my favorites in this is the $100 laptop.
p134
aVAnd I don't mean to steal any thunder here,
p135
aVbut we've gone and used one of these things to be an e-book reader.
p136
aVSo here's one of the beta units and you can \u2014
p137
aVit actually turns out to be a really good-looking e-book reader.
p138
aVAnd we have a quick hack that we did to try to put one of our books on it,
p139
aVand it turns out that 200 dots per inch
p140
aVmeans that you can put scanned books on them that look really good.
p141
aVAt 200 dots per inch, it's kind of the equivalent of a 300 dot print laser printer.
p142
aVWe're in good enough shape.
p143
aVYou actually can go and read scanned books quite easily.
p144
aa(lp145
VSo the idea of electronic books is starting to come about.
p146
aVBut how do you go about doing all this scanning?
p147
aVSo we thought, okay, well, let's try out this send books to India thing.
p148
aVAnd there was a project with, funded by the National Science Foundation \u2014
p149
aVsent a bunch of scanners, and the American libraries were supposed to send books.
p150
aVWell, they didn't. They didn't want to send their books.
p151
aVSo we bought 100,000 books and sent them to India.
p152
aVAnd then we learned why you don't want to send books to India.
p153
aVThe lesson we learned out of this is, scan your own books.
p154
aVIf you really care about books, you're going to scan them better,
p155
aVespecially if they're valuable books.
p156
aVIf they're new books and you can just, you know, butcher them,
p157
aVbecause you could just buy another one,
p158
aVthat's not such a big deal in terms of doing high-quality scanning.
p159
aVBut do things that you love.
p160
aVBut the Indians have been scanning a lot of their own books \u2014
p161
aVabout 300,000 now \u2014 doing very well.
p162
aVThe Chinese did over a million, and the Egyptians are about 30,000.
p163
aa(lp164
VBut we sent \u2014 thought, OK, if we're going to need to do this, let's do it in-library.
p165
aVHow do we go and do this, and how do we get it down
p166
aVso that it's a cost point that we could afford?
p167
aVAnd we sort of picked the price point of 10 cents a page.
p168
aVIf it's basically the cost of xeroxing to basically digitize, OCR, package it up,
p169
aVmake it so that you could download, print and bind it \u2014 the whole shebang \u2014
p170
aVwe would have achieved something.
p171
aVSo we started out trying to figure out. How do we get to 10 cents?
p172
aVAnd we tried these robot things, and they worked pretty well \u2014
p173
aVsort of these auto-page-turning things.
p174
aVIf we can have Mars Rovers, you'd think you could turn pages.
p175
aVBut it actually turns out to be pretty hard to turn pages, and the volume isn't there.
p176
aVSo anyway \u2014 so we ended up making our own book scanner,
p177
aVand with two digital, high-grade, professional digital cameras,
p178
aVcontrolled museum lighting, so even if it's a black and white book,
p179
aVyou can go and get the proper intonation.
p180
aVSo you basically do a beautiful, respectful job.
p181
aVThis is not a fax, this is \u2014 the idea is to do a beautiful job
p182
aVas you're going through these libraries.
p183
aVAnd we've been able to achieve 10 cents a page if we run things in volume.
p184
aVThis is what it looks like at the University of Toronto.
p185
aVAnd actually, it turns out to, you know, pay a living wage.
p186
aVPeople seem to love it.
p187
aVYes, it's a little boring, but some people kind of get into the Zen of it.
p188
aV(Laughter)
p189
aVAnd especially if it's kind of interesting books that you care about,
p190
aVin languages that you can read.
p191
aVWe actually have been able to do a pretty good job of this, at getting 10 cents a page.
p192
aVSo 10 cents a page, 300 pages in your average book, 30 dollars a book.
p193
aVThe Library of Congress, if you did the whole darn thing \u2014
p194
aV26 million books \u2014 is about 750 million dollars, right?
p195
aVBut a million books, I think, actually would be a pretty good start,
p196
aVand that would cost 30 million dollars. That's not that big a bill.
p197
aa(lp198
VAnd what we've been able to do is get into libraries.
p199
aVWe've now got eight of these scanning centers in three countries,
p200
aVand libraries are up for having their books scanned.
p201
aVThe Getty here is moving their books to the UCLA,
p202
aVwhich is where we have one these scanning centers,
p203
aVand scanning their out-of-copyright books, which is fabulous.
p204
aVSo we're starting to get the institutional responsibility.
p205
aVThe thing we're missing is the 10 cents.
p206
aVIf we can get the 10 cents, all the rest of it flows.
p207
aVWe've scanned about 200,000 books.
p208
aVNow we're scanning about 15,000 books a month,
p209
aVand it's starting to gear up another factor of two from there.
p210
aa(lp211
VSo all in all, that's going very well.
p212
aVAnd we're starting to move out of the just out-of-copyright
p213
aVinto the out-of-print world.
p214
aVSo I think of \u2014 we're kind of going from the out-of-copyright, library stuff,
p215
aVand Amazon.com is coming from the in-print world.
p216
aVAnd I think we'll meet in the middle some place,
p217
aVand have the classic thing that you have,
p218
aVwhich is a publishing system and a library system working in parallel.
p219
aVAnd so we're starting up a program to do out-of-print works, but loaning them.
p220
aVExactly what loaning means, I'm not quite sure.
p221
aVBut anyway, loaning out-of-print works from the Boston Public Library,
p222
aVthe Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute and a few other libraries
p223
aVthat are starting to participate in this program,
p224
aVto try out this model of where does a library stop
p225
aVand where does the bookstore take over.
p226
aVSo all in all, it's possible to do this in large scale.
p227
aVWe're also going back over microfilm and getting that online.
p228
aVSo, we can do 10 cents a page, we're going 15,000 books a month
p229
aVand we've got about 250,000 books online,
p230
aVcounting all the other projects that are starting to add in.
p231
aVSo what I wanted to argue is, books are within our grasp.
p232
aVThe idea of taking on the whole ball of wax is not that big a deal.
p233
aVYes, it costs tens of millions, low hundreds of millions,
p234
aVbut one time shot and we've got basically the history of printed literature online.
p235
aVAnd then, there's business model issues
p236
aVabout how to try to effectively market it and get it to people.
p237
aVBut it is within our grasp, technologically and law-wise,
p238
aVat least for the out of print and out of copyright,
p239
aVwe suggest, to be able to get the whole darn thing online.
p240
aa(lp241
VNow let's go for audio, and I'm going to go through these.
p242
aVSo how much is there?
p243
aVWell, as best we can tell, there are about two to three million disks
p244
aVhaving been published \u2014 so 78s, long-playing records and CDs \u2014
p245
aVor at least that's the largest archives of published materials
p246
aVwe've been able to sort of point at.
p247
aVIt costs about 10 dollars a piece to go and take a disk
p248
aVand put it online, if you're doing things in volume.
p249
aVBut we've found that the rights issues are really quite thorny.
p250
aVThis is a fairly heavily litigated area,
p251
aVso we've found that there are niches in the music world
p252
aVthat aren't served terribly well by the classic commercial publishing system.
p253
aVAnd we've been starting to make these available by going
p254
aVand offering shelf space on the Net.
p255
aVIn the United States, it doesn't cost you to give something away. Right?
p256
aVIf you give something to a charity or to the public,
p257
aVyou get a pat on the back and a tax donation \u2014
p258
aVexcept on the Net, where you can go broke.
p259
aVIf you put up a video of your garage band, and it starts getting heavily accessed,
p260
aVyou can lose your guitars or your house.
p261
aa(lp262
VThis doesn't make any sense.
p263
aVSo we've offered unlimited storage, unlimited bandwidth, forever, for free,
p264
aVto anybody that has something to share that belongs in a library.
p265
aVAnd we've been getting a lot of takers. One is the rock 'n' rollers.
p266
aVThe rock 'n' rollers had a tradition of sharing,
p267
aVas long as nobody made any money. You could \u2014
p268
aVconcert recordings, it's not the commercial recordings,
p269
aVbut concert recordings, started by the Grateful Dead.
p270
aVAnd we get about two or three bands a day signing up.
p271
aVThey give permission, and we get about 40 or 50 concerts a day.
p272
aVWe have about 40,000 concerts, everything the Grateful Dead ever did,
p273
aVup on the Net, so that people can see it and listen to this material.
p274
aVSo audio is possible to put up, but the rights issues are really pretty thorny.
p275
aVWe've got a lot of collections now \u2014
p276
aVa couple hundred thousand items \u2014 and it's growing over time.
p277
aa(lp278
VMoving images: if you think of theatrical releases,
p279
aVthere are not that many of them.
p280
aVAs best we can tell, there are about 150,000 to 200,000 movies ever
p281
aVthat are really meant for a large-scale theatrical distribution. It's just not that many.
p282
aVBut half of those were Indian.
p283
aVBut anyway, it's doable,
p284
aVbut we've only found about a thousand of these things that \u2014
p285
aVto be out of copyright.
p286
aVSo we've digitized those and made those available.
p287
aVBut we've found that there's lots of other types of movies
p288
aVthat haven't really seen the light of day \u2014 archival films.
p289
aVWe've found, also, a lot of political films, a lot of amateur films,
p290
aVall sorts of things that are basically needing a home, a permanent home.
p291
aVSo we've been starting to make these available and it's grown to be very popular.
p292
aVWe're not quite a YouTube.
p293
aVWe tended towards longer-term things
p294
aVand also things that people can reuse and make into new movies,
p295
aVwhich has just been great fun.
p296
aa(lp297
VTelevision comes quite a bit larger.
p298
aVWe started recording 20 channels of television 24 hours a day.
p299
aVIt's sort of the biggest TiVo box you've ever seen.
p300
aVIt's about a petabyte, so far, of worldwide television \u2014
p301
aVRussian, Chinese, Japanese, Iraqi, Al Jazeera, BBC, CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC \u2014
p302
aV24 hours a day.
p303
aVWe only put one week up,
p304
aVwhich is mostly for cost reasons, which is the 9/11,
p305
aVsort of from 9/11/2001. For one week, what did the world see?
p306
aVCNN was saying that Palestinians were dancing in the streets.
p307
aVWere they? Let's look at the Palestinian television and find out.
p308
aVHow can we have critical thinking without being able to quote
p309
aVand being able to compare what happened in the past?
p310
aVAnd television is dreadfully unrecorded and unquotable,
p311
aVexcept by Jon Stewart, who does a fabulous job.
p312
aVSo anyway, television is, I would suggest, within our grasp.
p313
aVSo 15 dollars per video hour, and also about 100 dollars to 150 dollars per celluloid hour,
p314
aVwe're able to go and get materials online very inexpensively
p315
aVand have them up on the Net.
p316
aVAnd we've got, now, a lot of these materials.
p317
aVSo we've got about 100,000 pieces up there.
p318
aVSo books, music, video, software. There's only 50,000 titles of it.
p319
aVMostly the issues there are legal issues and breaking copy protections.
p320
aVBut we've worked through some of those,
p321
aVbut we've still got real problems in Washington.
p322
aa(lp323
VWell, we're best known as the World Wide Web.
p324
aVWe've been archiving the World Wide Web since 1996.
p325
aVWe take a snapshot of every website and all of the pages on it, every two months.
p326
aVAnd actually, it's really been pioneered by Alexa Internet,
p327
aVwhich donates this collection to the Internet Archive.
p328
aVAnd it's been growing along for the last 11 years, and it's a fantastic resource.
p329
aVAnd we've made a Wayback Machine
p330
aVthat you can then go and see old websites kind of the way they were.
p331
aVIf you go and search on something \u2014 this is Google.com,
p332
aVthe different versions of it that we have,
p333
aVthis is what it looks like when it was an alpha release,
p334
aVand this is what it looked like at Stanford.
p335
aVSo anyway, you've got basically an idea of where things came from.
p336
aVMostly, people want to see their old stuff out of this.
p337
aVIf there's one thing that we want to learn from the Library of Alexandria version one,
p338
aVwhich is probably best known for burning,
p339
aVis, don't just have one copy.
p340
aVSo we've started to \u2014 we've made another copy of all of this
p341
aVand we actually put it back in the Library of Alexandria.
p342
aVSo this is a picture of the Internet Archive at the Library of Alexandria.
p343
aVAnd we now have also another copy building up in Amsterdam.
p344
aVSo, we should put it in the San Andreas Fault Line in San Francisco,
p345
aVflood zone in Amsterdam and in the Middle East. Right, so anyway ...
p346
aVso we're hedging our bets here.
p347
aVIf we go and put it in a couple more places, I think we'll be in good shape.
p348
aa(lp349
VThere's a political and social question out of this.
p350
aVIs all of this, as we go digital, is it going to be public or private?
p351
aVThere's some large companies that have seen this vision,
p352
aVthat are doing large-scale digitization,
p353
aVbut they're locking up the public domain.
p354
