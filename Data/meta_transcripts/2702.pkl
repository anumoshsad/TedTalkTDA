(lp3
VEight years ago, I was haunted by an evil spirit.
p4
aa(lp5
VI was 25 at the time,
p6
aVand I was living in a tiny house behind someone else's house
p7
aVin Los Angeles.
p8
aVIt was this guest house, it had kind of been dilapidated,
p9
aVnot taken care of for a long time.
p10
aVAnd one night, I was sitting there
p11
aVand I got this really spooky feeling,
p12
aVkind of the feeling like you're being watched.
p13
aVBut no one was there except my two dogs,
p14
aVand they were just chewing their feet.
p15
aVAnd I looked around. No one was there.
p16
aVAnd I thought, OK, it's just my imagination.
p17
aVBut the feeling just kept getting worse,
p18
aVand I started to feel this pressure in my chest,
p19
aVsort of like the feeling when you get bad news.
p20
aVBut it started to sink lower and lower
p21
aVand almost hurt.
p22
aa(lp23
VAnd over the course of that week, this feeling got worse and worse,
p24
aVand I started to become convinced that something was there
p25
aVin my little guest house, haunting me.
p26
aa(lp27
VAnd I started to hear these sounds,
p28
aVthis "whoosh," kind of whisper, like something passing through me.
p29
aVI called my best friend, Claire, and said,
p30
aV"I know this is going to sound crazy,
p31
aVbut, um ...
p32
aVI think there's a ghost in my house, and I need to get rid of it."
p33
aVAnd she said \u2014 she's very open-minded \u2014 and she said,
p34
aV"I don't think you're crazy.
p35
aVI think you just need to do a cleansing ritual."
p36
aa(lp37
V(Laughter)
p38
aa(lp39
V"So get some sage and burn it,
p40
aVand tell it to go away."
p41
aa(lp42
VSo I said, "OK," and I went and I bought sage.
p43
aVI had never done this before, so I set the sage on fire,
p44
aVwaved it about, and said, "Go away! This is my house! I live here.
p45
aVYou don't live here!"
p46
aVBut the feeling stayed. Nothing got better.
p47
aVAnd then I started to think,
p48
aVOK, well now this thing is probably just laughing at me,
p49
aVbecause it hasn't left,
p50
aVand I probably just look like this impotent, powerless thing
p51
aVthat couldn't get it to go away.
p52
aa(lp53
VSo every day I'd come home
p54
aVand you guys, this feeling got so bad that \u2014 I mean, I'm laughing at it now \u2014
p55
aVbut I would sit there in bed and cry every night.
p56
aVAnd the feeling on my chest got worse and worse.
p57
aVIt was physically painful.
p58
aVAnd I even went to a psychiatrist
p59
aVand tried to get her to prescribe me medicine,
p60
aVand she wouldn't just because I don't have schizophrenia, OK.
p61
aa(lp62
V(Laughter)
p63
aVSo finally I got on the internet, and I Googled "hauntings."
p64
aVAnd I came upon this forum of ghost hunters.
p65
aVBut these were a special kind of ghost hunters \u2014
p66
aVthey were skeptics.
p67
aVThey believed that every case of ghosts that they had investigated so far
p68
aVhad been explained away by science.
p69
aVAnd I was like, "OK, smart guys, this is what's happening to me,
p70
aVand if you have an explanation for me, I would love to hear it."
p71
aa(lp72
VAnd one of them said, "OK.
p73
aVUm, have you heard of carbon monoxide poisoning?"
p74
aa(lp75
VAnd I said, "Yeah.
p76
aVLike, gas poisoning?"
p77
aa(lp78
VCarbon monoxide poisoning is when you have a gas leak
p79
aVleaking into your home.
p80
aVI looked it up, and the symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning
p81
aVinclude a pressure on your chest,
p82
aVauditory hallucinations \u2014 whoosh \u2014
p83
aVand an unexplained feeling of dread.
p84
aVSo that night, I called the gas company.
p85
aVI said, "I have an emergency. I need you to come out.
p86
aVI don't want to get into the story now, but I need you to come out."
p87
aa(lp88
V(Laughter)
p89
aa(lp90
VThey came out. I said, "I suspect a gas leak."
p91
aVThey brought their carbon monoxide detector,
p92
aVand the man said,
p93
aV"It's a really good thing that you called us tonight,
p94
aVbecause you could have been dead very soon."
p95
aa(lp96
VThirty-seven percent of Americans believe in haunted houses,
p97
aVand I wonder how many of them have been in one
p98
aVand how many of them have been in danger.
p99
aa(lp100
VSo that haunting story has led me to my job.
p101
aVI'm an investigator, and I'm an investigator in two senses:
p102
aVI'm an investigative journalist,
p103
aVand I'm also an investigator of the claims of the paranormal
p104
aVand claims of the spiritual.
p105
aVAnd that means a few things.
p106
aVSometimes that means that I'm pretending to need an exorcism
p107
aVso I can get \u2014 yes, that's right! \u2014 so I can go to an exorcist
p108
aVand see if he's using gimmicks or psychological tricks
p109
aVto try to convince someone that they're possessed.
p110
aVSometimes that means I'm going undercover in a fringe group
p111
aVwhich I report on for a podcast that I co-host.
p112
aVAnd I've done over 70 investigations like this with my co-host, Ross.
p113
aVI would love to tell you that nine times out of 10, science wins,
p114
aVsaves the day, it's all explained.
p115
aVThat's not true.
p116
aVThe truth is, 10 times out of 10, science wins, it saves the day.
p117
aa(lp118
V(Applause)
p119
aa(lp120
VAnd that doesn't mean there's no such thing as a mystery.
p121
aVOf course there are mysteries, but a mystery is a mystery.
p122
aVIt is not a ghost.
p123
aa(lp124
VNow, I believe there are two kinds of truth,
p125
aVand it's taken me a while to get to this place, but I think this is right,
p126
aVso hear me out.
p127
aVI think there is outer truth and there's inner truth.
p128
aVSo if you say to me,
p129
aV"There was a man named Jesus and he once existed,"
p130
aVthat's outer truth, right?
p131
aVAnd we can go and look at the historical record.
p132
aVWe can determine whether that seems to be true.
p133
aVAnd I would argue, it does seem to be true.
p134
aVIf you say, "Jesus rose from the dead," \u2014 ooh, trickier.
p135
aa(lp136
V(Laughter)
p137
aa(lp138
VI would say that's an outer-truth claim,
p139
aVbecause he physically rose or he didn't.
p140
aVI'm not going to get into whether he rose or he didn't,
p141
aVbut I would say that's an outer-truth claim.
p142
aVIt happened or it didn't happen.
p143
aVBut if you say, "I don't care whether he rose from the dead.
p144
aVIt's symbolically important to me,
p145
aVand that metaphor is so meaningful, so purposeful to me,
p146
aVand I'm not going to try to persuade you of it,"
p147
aVnow you've moved it from outer truth to inner truth,
p148
aVfrom science to art.
p149
aVAnd I think we have a tendency to not be clear about this,
p150
aVto try to move our inner truths to outer truths,
p151
aVor to not be fair about it to each other,
p152
aVand when people are telling us their inner truths,
p153
aVto try to make them defend them by outer-truth standards.
p154
aa(lp155
VSo I'm talking here about outer truth, about objective things.
p156
aVAnd there was an objective reality in my haunted house, right?
p157
aVNow that I've told you about the gas leak,
p158
aVI doubt a single person here would be like,
p159
aV"I still think there was a ghost, too" \u2014
p160
aa(lp161
V(Laughter)
p162
aa(lp163
Vbecause as soon as we have these scientific explanations,
p164
aVwe know to give up the ghost.
p165
aVWe use these things as stopgaps for things that we can't explain.
p166
aVWe don't believe them because of evidence;
p167
aVwe believe them because of a lack of evidence.
p168
aa(lp169
VSo there is a group in Los Angeles
p170
aVcalled the Independent Investigations Group, or the IIG,
p171
aVand they do great work.
p172
aVThey'll give a $10,000 prize
p173
aVto anyone who can show, under scientific conditions,
p174
aVthat they have a paranormal ability.
p175
aVNo one's done it yet,
p176
aVbut they've had a couple people who claim that they were clairaudients,
p177
aVwhich means that they can hear voices either from the great beyond
p178
aVor they can read minds.
p179
aVAnd they had one person who was very sincere,
p180
aVwho believed that he could read minds.
p181
aVSo they set up a test with him, and this is the way it always works.
p182
aVThe group says, "OK, we have a protocol,
p183
aVwe have a way to scientifically test this.
p184
aVDo you agree with it?"
p185
aVThe person says yes. Then they test it.
p186
aVIt's very important that both sides agree.
p187
aVThey did that, they tested him.
p188
aVThey said, "OK, you know what?
p189
aVYou weren't able to predict what Lisa was thinking.
p190
aVIt matched up about the same as chance.
p191
aVLooks like you don't have the power."
p192
aa(lp193
VAnd that gave them the opportunity
p194
aVto compassionately sit down with him and have a very difficult discussion,
p195
aVwhich basically amounted to,
p196
aV"Hey, we know you're sincere, and what that means is,
p197
aVyou do hear something in your head."
p198
aa(lp199
VAnd that guy got to make the very difficult decision,
p200
aVbut really the life-changing decision about whether to go get help.
p201
aVWe're actually helping people to make these connections
p202
aVthat maybe before seemed like otherworldly explanations,
p203
aVhelp draw us into reality and maybe change our lives for the better.
p204
aa(lp205
VNow, on the other hand, maybe one time it'll turn out to be true.
p206
aVMaybe we'll find out there are ghosts,
p207
aVand holy shit, it will be the best thing!
p208
aVAnd every time I do one of these investigations,
p209
aVI still get so excited,
p210
aVand I'm like 75 into them,
p211
aVand still I swear on number 76, I'm going to be like, "This is the one!"
p212
aa(lp213
V(Laughter)
p214
aa(lp215
VMaybe I'm just eternally optimistic, but I hope I never lose this hope,
p216
aVand I invite you to take this same attitude
p217
aVwhen people share their outer beliefs with you.
p218
aVWhen talking about testable claims,
p219
aVrespect them enough to ask these good questions.
p220
aVChallenge and see how you can examine them together,
p221
aVbecause there's this idea that you can't respect a belief
p222
aVand still challenge it, but that's not true.
p223
aVWhen we jiggle the lock, when we test the claim,
p224
aVwe're saying, OK, I respect you, I'm listening to what you're saying,
p225
aVI'm going to test it out with you.
p226
aVWe've all had that experience where you're telling someone something,
p227
aVand they're like, "Oh, that's really interesting, yeah,"
p228
aVyou know you're being had.
p229
aVBut when someone says, "Really? Huh.
p230
aVSounds a little sketchy to me, but I'm listening,"
p231
aVyou at least know you're being engaged and respected.
p232
aVAnd that's the kind of attitude we should have with these claims.
p233
aVThat's showing someone that you care what they're saying.
p234
aVThat's respect.
p235
aa(lp236
VNow, yes, most of these searches will come up empty,
p237
aVbut that's how all of science works.
p238
aVEvery cure for cancer so far has not panned out,
p239
aVbut we don't stop looking,
p240
aVfor two reasons.
p241
aVBecause number one, the answer matters.
p242
aVWhether it's looking at the afterlife or the paranormal or the cure for cancer,
p243
aVit all amounts to the same question:
p244
aVHow long will we be here?
p245
aa(lp246
VAnd two, because looking for the truth,
p247
aVbeing open-minded,
p248
aVand being willing to be wrong and to change your whole worldview
p249
aVis awe-inspiring.
p250
aa(lp251
VI still get excited at ghost stories every single time.
p252
aVI still consider that every group I join might be right,
p253
aVand I hope I never lose that hope.
p254
aVLet's all never lose that hope,
p255
aVbecause searching for what's out there
p256
aVhelps us understand what's in here.
p257
aVAnd also, please have a carbon monoxide detector in your home.
p258
aa(lp259
VThank you.
