VWe are today talking about moral persuasion:
p4
aVWhat is moral and immoral in trying to change people's behaviors
p5
aVby using technology and using design?
p6
aa(lp7
VAnd I don't know what you expect,
p8
aVbut when I was thinking about that issue,
p9
aVI early on realized what I'm not able to give you are answers.
p10
aVI'm not able to tell you what is moral or immoral,
p11
aVbecause we're living in a pluralist society.
p12
aVMy values can be radically different from your values,
p13
aVwhich means that what I consider moral or immoral based on that
p14
aVmight not necessarily be what you consider moral or immoral.
p15
aa(lp16
VBut I also realized there is one thing that I could give you,
p17
aVand that is what this guy behind me gave the world \u2014
p18
aVSocrates.
p19
aVIt is questions.
p20
aVWhat I can do and what I would like to do with you
p21
aVis give you, like that initial question,
p22
aVa set of questions to figure out for yourselves,
p23
aVlayer by layer, like peeling an onion,
p24
aVgetting at the core of what you believe is moral or immoral persuasion.
p25
aVAnd I'd like to do that with a couple of examples of technologies
p26
aVwhere people have used game elements to get people to do things.
p27
aa(lp28
VSo it's at first a very simple, very obvious question
p29
aVI would like to give you:
p30
aVWhat are your intentions if you are designing something?
p31
aVAnd obviously, intentions are not the only thing,
p32
aVso here is another example for one of these applications.
p33
aVThere are a couple of these kinds of Eco dashboards right now \u2014
p34
aVdashboards built into cars \u2014
p35
aVwhich try to motivate you to drive more fuel-efficiently.
p36
aVThis here is Nissan's MyLeaf,
p37
aVwhere your driving behavior is compared with the driving behavior
p38
aVof other people,
p39
aVso you can compete for who drives a route the most fuel-efficiently.
p40
aVAnd these things are very effective, it turns out \u2014
p41
aVso effective that they motivate people to engage in unsafe driving behaviors,
p42
aVlike not stopping at a red light,
p43
aVbecause that way you have to stop and restart the engine,
p44
aVand that would use quite some fuel, wouldn't it?
p45
aVSo despite this being a very well-intended application,
p46
aVobviously there was a side effect of that.
p47
aa(lp48
VHere's another example for one of these side effects.
p49
aVCommendable: a site that allows parents to give their kids little badges
p50
aVfor doing the things that parents want their kids to do,
p51
aVlike tying their shoes.
p52
aVAnd at first that sounds very nice,
p53
aVvery benign, well-intended.
p54
aVBut it turns out, if you look into research on people's mindset,
p55
aVcaring about outcomes,
p56
aVcaring about public recognition,
p57
aVcaring about these kinds of public tokens of recognition
p58
aVis not necessarily very helpful
p59
aVfor your long-term psychological well-being.
p60
aVIt's better if you care about learning something.
p61
aVIt's better when you care about yourself
p62
aVthan how you appear in front of other people.
p63
aVSo that kind of motivational tool that is used actually, in and of itself,
p64
aVhas a long-term side effect,
p65
aVin that every time we use a technology
p66
aVthat uses something like public recognition or status,
p67
aVwe're actually positively endorsing this
p68
aVas a good and normal thing to care about \u2014
p69
aVthat way, possibly having a detrimental effect
p70
aVon the long-term psychological well-being of ourselves as a culture.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo that's a second, very obvious question:
p73
aVWhat are the effects of what you're doing \u2014
p74
aVthe effects you're having with the device, like less fuel,
p75
aVas well as the effects of the actual tools you're using
p76
aVto get people to do things \u2014
p77
aVpublic recognition?
p78
aa(lp79
VNow is that all \u2014 intention, effect?
p80
aVWell, there are some technologies which obviously combine both.
p81
aVBoth good long-term and short-term effects
p82
aVand a positive intention like Fred Stutzman's "Freedom,"
p83
aVwhere the whole point of that application is \u2014
p84
aVwell, we're usually so bombarded with constant requests by other people,
p85
aVwith this device,
p86
aVyou can shut off the Internet connectivity of your PC of choice
p87
aVfor a pre-set amount of time,
p88
aVto actually get some work done.
p89
aVAnd I think most of us will agree that's something well-intended,
p90
aVand also has good consequences.
p91
aVIn the words of Michel Foucault,
p92
aVit is a "technology of the self."
p93
aVIt is a technology that empowers the individual
p94
aVto determine its own life course,
p95
aVto shape itself.
p96
aa(lp97
VBut the problem is, as Foucault points out,
p98
aVthat every technology of the self
p99
aVhas a technology of domination as its flip side.
p100
aVAs you see in today's modern liberal democracies,
p101
aVthe society, the state, not only allows us to determine our self,
p102
aVto shape our self,
p103
aVit also demands it of us.
p104
aVIt demands that we optimize ourselves,
p105
aVthat we control ourselves,
p106
aVthat we self-manage continuously,
p107
aVbecause that's the only way in which such a liberal society works.
p108
aVThese technologies want us to stay in the game
p109
aVthat society has devised for us.
p110
aVThey want us to fit in even better.
p111
aVThey want us to optimize ourselves to fit in.
p112
aa(lp113
VNow, I don't say that is necessarily a bad thing;
p114
aVI just think that this example points us to a general realization,
p115
aVand that is: no matter what technology or design you look at,
p116
aVeven something we consider as well-intended
p117
aVand as good in its effects as Stutzman's Freedom,
p118
aVcomes with certain values embedded in it.
p119
aVAnd we can question these values.
p120
aVWe can question: Is it a good thing
p121
aVthat all of us continuously self-optimize ourselves
p122
aVto fit better into that society?
p123
aa(lp124
VOr to give you another example:
p125
aVWhat about a piece of persuasive technology
p126
aVthat convinces Muslim women to wear their headscarves?
p127
aVIs that a good or a bad technology
p128
aVin its intentions or in its effects?
p129
aVWell, that basically depends on the kind of values you bring to bear
p130
aVto make these kinds of judgments.
p131
aa(lp132
VSo that's a third question:
p133
aVWhat values do you use to judge?
p134
aVAnd speaking of values:
p135
aVI've noticed that in the discussion about moral persuasion online
p136
aVand when I'm talking with people,
p137
aVmore often than not, there is a weird bias.
p138
aVAnd that bias is that we're asking:
p139
aVIs this or that "still" ethical?
p140
aVIs it "still" permissible?
p141
aVWe're asking things like:
p142
aVIs this Oxfam donation form,
p143
aVwhere the regular monthly donation is the preset default,
p144
aVand people, maybe without intending it,
p145
aVare encouraged or nudged into giving a regular donation
p146
aVinstead of a one-time donation,
p147
aVis that "still' permissible?
p148
aVIs it "still" ethical?
p149
aVWe're fishing at the low end.
p150
aa(lp151
VBut in fact, that question, "Is it 'still' ethical?"
p152
aVis just one way of looking at ethics.
p153
aVBecause if you look at the beginning of ethics in Western culture,
p154
aVyou see a very different idea of what ethics also could be.
p155
aVFor Aristotle, ethics was not about the question,
p156
aV"Is that still good, or is it bad?"
p157
aVEthics was about the question of how to live life well.
p158
aVAnd he put that in the word "arête,"
p159
aVwhich we, from [Ancient Greek], translate as "virtue."
p160
aVBut really, it means "excellence."
p161
aVIt means living up to your own full potential as a human being.
p162
aa(lp163
VAnd that is an idea that, I think,
p164
aVPaul Richard Buchanan put nicely in a recent essay,
p165
aVwhere he said, "Products are vivid arguments
p166
aVabout how we should live our lives."
p167
aVOur designs are not ethical or unethical
p168
aVin that they're using ethical or unethical means of persuading us.
p169
aVThey have a moral component
p170
aVjust in the kind of vision and the aspiration of the good life
p171
aVthat they present to us.
p172
aa(lp173
VAnd if you look into the designed environment around us
p174
aVwith that kind of lens,
p175
aVasking, "What is the vision of the good life
p176
aVthat our products, our design, present to us?",
p177
aVthen you often get the shivers,
p178
aVbecause of how little we expect of each other,
p179
aVof how little we actually seem to expect of our life,
p180
aVand what the good life looks like.
p181
aa(lp182
VSo that's a fourth question I'd like to leave you with:
p183
aVWhat vision of the good life do your designs convey?
p184
aVAnd speaking of design,
p185
aVyou'll notice that I already broadened the discussion,
p186
aVbecause it's not just persuasive technology that we're talking about here,
p187
aVit's any piece of design that we put out here in the world.
p188
aa(lp189
VI don't know whether you know
p190
aVthe great communication researcher Paul Watzlawick who, back in the '60s,
p191
aVmade the argument that we cannot not communicate.
p192
aVEven if we choose to be silent, we chose to be silent,
p193
aVand we're communicating something by choosing to be silent.
p194
aVAnd in the same way that we cannot not communicate,
p195
aVwe cannot not persuade:
p196
aVwhatever we do or refrain from doing,
p197
aVwhatever we put out there as a piece of design, into the world,
p198
aVhas a persuasive component.
p199
aVIt tries to affect people.
p200
aVIt puts a certain vision of the good life out there in front of us,
p201
aa(lp202
Vwhich is what Peter-Paul Verbeek,
p203
aVthe Dutch philosopher of technology, says.
p204
aVNo matter whether we as designers intend it or not,
p205
aVwe materialize morality.
p206
aVWe make certain things harder and easier to do.
p207
aVWe organize the existence of people.
p208
aVWe put a certain vision
p209
aVof what good or bad or normal or usual is
p210
aVin front of people,
p211
aVby everything we put out there in the world.
p212
aa(lp213
VEven something as innocuous as a set of school chairs
p214
aVis a persuasive technology,
p215
aVbecause it presents and materializes a certain vision of the good life \u2014
p216
aVa good life in which teaching and learning and listening
p217
aVis about one person teaching, the others listening;
p218
aVin which it is about learning-is-done-while-sitting;
p219
aVin which you learn for yourself;
p220
aVin which you're not supposed to change these rules,
p221
aVbecause the chairs are fixed to the ground.
p222
aa(lp223
VAnd even something as innocuous as a single-design chair,
p224
aVlike this one by Arne Jacobsen,
p225
aVis a persuasive technology,
p226
aVbecause, again, it communicates an idea of the good life:
p227
aVa good life \u2014 a life that you, as a designer, consent to by saying,
p228
aV"In a good life, goods are produced as sustainably or unsustainably
p229
aVas this chair.
p230
aVWorkers are treated as well or as badly
p231
aVas the workers were treated that built that chair."
p232
aVThe good life is a life where design is important
p233
aVbecause somebody obviously took the time and spent the money
p234
aVfor that kind of well-designed chair;
p235
aVwhere tradition is important,
p236
aVbecause this is a traditional classic and someone cared about this;
p237
aVand where there is something as conspicuous consumption,
p238
aVwhere it is OK and normal to spend a humongous amount of money
p239
aVon such a chair,
p240
aVto signal to other people what your social status is.
p241
aa(lp242
VSo these are the kinds of layers, the kinds of questions
p243
aVI wanted to lead you through today;
p244
aVthe question of: What are the intentions that you bring to bear
p245
aVwhen you're designing something?
p246
aVWhat are the effects, intended and unintended, that you're having?
p247
aVWhat are the values you're using to judge those?
p248
aVWhat are the virtues, the aspirations
p249
aVthat you're actually expressing in that?
p250
aVAnd how does that apply,
p251
aVnot just to persuasive technology,
p252
aVbut to everything you design?
p253
aa(lp254
VDo we stop there?
p255
aVI don't think so.
p256
aVI think that all of these things are eventually informed
p257
aVby the core of all of this,
p258
aVand this is nothing but life itself.
p259
aVWhy, when the question of what the good life is
p260
aVinforms everything that we design,
p261
aVshould we stop at design and not ask ourselves:
p262
aVHow does it apply to our own life?
p263
aV"Why should the lamp or the house be an art object,
p264
aVbut not our life?"
p265
aVas Michel Foucault puts it.
p266
aa(lp267
VJust to give you a practical example of Buster Benson.
p268
aVThis is Buster setting up a pull-up machine
p269
aVat the office of his new start-up, Habit Labs,
p270
aVwhere they're trying to build other applications like "Health Month"
p271
aVfor people.
p272
aVAnd why is he building a thing like this?
p273
aVWell, here is the set of axioms
p274
aVthat Habit Labs, Buster's start-up, put up for themselves
p275
aVon how they wanted to work together as a team
p276
aVwhen they're building these applications \u2014
p277
aVa set of moral principles they set themselves
p278
aVfor working together \u2014
p279
aVone of them being,
p280
aV"We take care of our own health and manage our own burnout."
p281
aa(lp282
VBecause ultimately, how can you ask yourselves
p283
aVand how can you find an answer on what vision of the good life
p284
aVyou want to convey and create with your designs
p285
aVwithout asking the question:
p286
aVWhat vision of the good life do you yourself want to live?
p287
aa(lp288
VAnd with that,
p289
aVI thank you.
