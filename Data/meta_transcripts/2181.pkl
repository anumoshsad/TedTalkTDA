VSo infectious diseases, right?
p4
aVInfectious diseases  are still the main cause
p5
aVof human suffering and death  around the world.
p6
aVEvery year, millions of people die of diseases such as T.B., malaria, HIV,
p7
aVaround the world  and even in the United States.
p8
aVEvery year, thousands of Americans die of seasonal flu.
p9
aa(lp10
VNow of course, humans, we are creative. Right?
p11
aVWe have come up with ways to protect ourselves against these diseases.
p12
aVWe have drugs and vaccines.
p13
aVAnd we're conscious \u2014 we learn from our experiences
p14
aVand come up with creative solutions.
p15
aVWe used to think we're alone in this, but now we know we're not.
p16
aVWe're not the only medical doctors.
p17
aVNow we know that there's a lot of animals out there that can do it too.
p18
aVMost famous, perhaps, chimpanzees.
p19
aVNot so much different from us,
p20
aVthey can use plants to treat their intestinal parasites.
p21
aVBut the last few decades have shown us that other animals can do it too:
p22
aVelephants, porcupines, sheep, goats, you name it.
p23
aVAnd even more interesting than that is that recent discoveries are telling us
p24
aVthat insects and other little animals with smaller brains can use medication too.
p25
aa(lp26
VThe problem with infectious diseases, as we all know,
p27
aVis that pathogens continue to evolve,
p28
aVand a lot of the drugs that we have developed
p29
aVare losing their efficacy.
p30
aVAnd therefore, there is this great need to find new ways to discover drugs
p31
aVthat we can use against our diseases.
p32
aa(lp33
VNow, I think that we should look at these animals,
p34
aVand we can learn from them how to treat our own diseases.
p35
aVAs a biologist, I have been studying monarch butterflies for the last 10 years.
p36
aVNow, monarchs are extremely famous for their spectacular migrations
p37
aVfrom the U.S. and Canada down to Mexico every year,
p38
aVwhere millions of them come together,
p39
aVbut it's not why I started studying them.
p40
aVI study monarchs because they get sick.
p41
aVThey get sick like you. They get sick like me.
p42
aVAnd I think what they do can tell us a lot about drugs
p43
aVthat we can develop for humans.
p44
aa(lp45
VNow, the parasites that monarchs get infected with
p46
aVare called ophryocystis elektroscirrha \u2014 a mouthful.
p47
aVWhat they do is they produce spores,
p48
aVmillions of spores on the outside of the butterfly
p49
aVthat are shown as little specks in between the scales of the butterfly.
p50
aVAnd this is really detrimental to the monarch.
p51
aVIt shortens their lifespan,
p52
aVit reduces their ability to fly,
p53
aVit can even kill them before they're even adults.
p54
aVVery detrimental parasite.
p55
aa(lp56
VAs part of my job, I spend a lot of time in the greenhouse growing plants,
p57
aVand the reason for this is that monarchs are extremely picky eaters.
p58
aVThey only eat milkweed as larvae.
p59
aVLuckily, there are several species of milkweed that they can use,
p60
aVand all these milkweeds have cardenolides in them.
p61
aVThese are chemicals that are toxic.
p62
aVThey're toxic to most animals, but not to monarchs.
p63
aVIn fact, monarchs can take up the chemicals,
p64
aVput it in their own bodies, and it makes them toxic
p65
aVagainst their predators, such as birds.
p66
aVAnd what they do, then, is advertise this toxicity
p67
aVthrough their beautiful warning colorations
p68
aVwith this orange, black and white.
p69
aa(lp70
VSo what I did during my job is grow plants in the greenhouse,
p71
aVdifferent ones, different milkweeds.
p72
aVSome were toxic, including the tropical milkweed,
p73
aVwith very high concentrations of these cardenolides.
p74
aVAnd some were not toxic.
p75
aVAnd then I fed them to monarchs.
p76
aVSome of the monarchs were healthy. They had no disease.
p77
aVBut some of the monarchs were sick,
p78
aVand what I found is that some of these milkweeds are medicinal,
p79
aVmeaning they reduce the disease symptoms in the monarch butterflies,
p80
aVmeaning these monarchs can live longer when they are infected
p81
aVwhen feeding on these medicinal plants.
p82
aa(lp83
VAnd when I found this, I had this idea,
p84
aVand a lot of people said it was a crazy idea,
p85
aVbut I thought,  what if monarchs can use this?
p86
aVWhat if they can use these plants as their own form of medicine?
p87
aVWhat if they can act as medical doctors?
p88
aa(lp89
VSo my team and I started doing experiments.
p90
aVIn the first types of experiments,
p91
aVwe had caterpillars, and gave them a choice:
p92
aVmedicinal milkweed versus non-medicinal milkweed.
p93
aVAnd then we measured how much they ate of each species over their lifetime.
p94
aVAnd the result, as so often  in science, was boring:
p95
aVFifty percent of their food was medicinal. Fifty percent was not.
p96
aVThese caterpillars didn't do anything for their own welfare.
p97
aa(lp98
VSo then we moved on to adult butterflies,
p99
aVand we started asking the question
p100
aVwhether it's the mothers that can medicate their offspring.
p101
aVCan the mothers lay their eggs on medicinal milkweed
p102
aVthat will make their future offspring less sick?
p103
aVWe have done these experiments now over several years,
p104
aVand always get the same results.
p105
aVWhat we do is we put a monarch in a big cage,
p106
aVa medicinal plant on one side, a non-medicinal plant on the other side,
p107
aVand then we measure the number of eggs that the monarchs lay on each plant.
p108
aVAnd what we find when we do that is always the same.
p109
aVWhat we find is that the monarchs strongly prefer the medicinal milkweed.
p110
aVIn other words, what these females are doing
p111
aVis they're laying 68 percent of their eggs in the medicinal milkweed.
p112
aVIntriguingly, what they do is they actually transmit the parasites
p113
aVwhen they're laying the eggs.
p114
aVThey cannot prevent this.
p115
aVThey can also not medicate themselves.
p116
aVBut what these experiments tell us
p117
aVis that these monarchs, these mothers, can lay their eggs on medicinal milkweed
p118
aVthat will make their future offspring less sick.
p119
aa(lp120
VNow, this is a really important discovery, I think,
p121
aVnot just because it tells us something cool about nature,
p122
aVbut also because it may tell us something more about how we should find drugs.
p123
aVNow, these are animals that are very small
p124
aVand we tend to think of them as very simple.
p125
aVThey have tiny little brains,
p126
aVyet they can do this very sophisticated medication.
p127
aVNow, we know that even today, most of our drugs
p128
aVderive from natural products, including plants,
p129
aVand in indigenous cultures,
p130
aVtraditional healers often look at animals to find new drugs.
p131
aVIn this way, elephants have told us how to treat stomach upset,
p132
aVand porcupines have told people how to treat bloody diarrhea.
p133
aVWhat I think is important,  though, is to move beyond
p134
aVthese large-brained mammals and give these guys more credit,
p135
aVthese simple animals, these insects that we tend to think of
p136
aVas very, very simple with tiny little brains.
p137
aVThe discovery that these animals can also use medication
p138
aVopens up completely new avenues,
p139
aVand I think that maybe one day, we will be treating human diseases
p140
aVwith drugs that were first discovered by butterflies,
p141
aVand I think that is an amazing opportunity worth pursuing.
