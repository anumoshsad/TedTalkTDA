VSheryl Shade: Hi, Aimee. Aimee Mullins: Hi.
p4
aa(lp5
VSS: Aimee and I thought we'd just talk a little bit,
p6
aVand I wanted her to tell all of you what makes her a distinctive athlete.
p7
aa(lp8
VAM: Well, for those of you who have seen the picture in the little bio \u2014
p9
aVit might have given it away \u2014
p10
aVI'm a double amputee, and I was born without fibulas in both legs.
p11
aVI was amputated at age one,
p12
aVand I've been running like hell ever since, all over the place.
p13
aa(lp14
VSS: Well, why don't you tell them how you got to Georgetown \u2014 why don't we start there?
p15
aVWhy don't we start there?
p16
aa(lp17
VAM: I'm a senior in Georgetown in the Foreign Service program.
p18
aVI won a full academic scholarship out of high school.
p19
aVThey pick three students out of the nation every year
p20
aVto get involved in international affairs,
p21
aVand so I won a full ride to Georgetown
p22
aVand I've been there for four years. Love it.
p23
aa(lp24
VSS: When Aimee got there,
p25
aVshe decided that she's, kind of, curious about track and field,
p26
aVso she decided to call someone and start asking about it.
p27
aVSo, why don't you tell that story?
p28
aa(lp29
VAM: Yeah. Well, I guess I've always been involved in sports.
p30
aVI played softball for five years growing up.
p31
aVI skied competitively throughout high school,
p32
aVand I got a little restless in college
p33
aVbecause I wasn't doing anything for about a year or two sports-wise.
p34
aVAnd I'd never competed on a disabled level, you know \u2014
p35
aVI'd always competed against other able-bodied athletes.
p36
aVThat's all I'd ever known.
p37
aVIn fact, I'd never even met another amputee until I was 17.
p38
aVAnd I heard that they do these track meets with all disabled runners,
p39
aVand I figured, "Oh, I don't know about this,
p40
aVbut before I judge it, let me go see what it's all about."
p41
aVSo, I booked myself a flight to Boston in '95, 19 years old
p42
aVand definitely the dark horse candidate at this race. I'd never done it before.
p43
aVI went out on a gravel track a couple of weeks before this meet
p44
aVto see how far I could run,
p45
aVand about 50 meters was enough for me, panting and heaving.
p46
aVAnd I had these legs that were made of
p47
aVa wood and plastic compound, attached with Velcro straps \u2014
p48
aVbig, thick, five-ply wool socks on \u2014
p49
aVyou know, not the most comfortable things, but all I'd ever known.
p50
aa(lp51
VAnd I'm up there in Boston against people
p52
aVwearing legs made of all things \u2014 carbon graphite
p53
aVand, you know, shock absorbers in them and all sorts of things \u2014
p54
aVand they're all looking at me like,
p55
aVOK, we know who's not going to win this race.
p56
aVAnd, I mean, I went up there expecting \u2014
p57
aVI don't know what I was expecting \u2014
p58
aVbut, you know, when I saw a man who was missing an entire leg
p59
aVgo up to the high jump, hop on one leg to the high jump
p60
aVand clear it at six feet, two inches ...
p61
aVDan O'Brien jumped 5'11" in '96 in Atlanta,
p62
aVI mean, if it just gives you a comparison of \u2014
p63
aVthese are truly accomplished athletes,
p64
aVwithout qualifying that word "athlete."
p65
aVAnd so I decided to give this a shot: heart pounding,
p66
aVI ran my first race and I beat the national record-holder
p67
aVby three hundredths of a second,
p68
aVand became the new national record-holder on my first try out.
p69
aa(lp70
VAnd, you know, people said,
p71
aV"Aimee, you know, you've got speed \u2014 you've got natural speed \u2014
p72
aVbut you don't have any skill or finesse going down that track.
p73
aVYou were all over the place.
p74
aVWe all saw how hard you were working."
p75
aVAnd so I decided to call the track coach at Georgetown.
p76
aVAnd I thank god I didn't know just how huge this man is in the track and field world.
p77
aVHe's coached five Olympians, and
p78
aVthe man's office is lined from floor to ceiling
p79
aVwith All America certificates
p80
aVof all these athletes he's coached.
p81
aVHe's just a rather intimidating figure.
p82
aVAnd I called him up and said, "Listen, I ran one race and I won ..."
p83
aa(lp84
V(Laughter)
p85
aa(lp86
V"I want to see if I can, you know \u2014
p87
aVI need to just see if I can sit in on some of your practices,
p88
aVsee what drills you do and whatever."
p89
aVThat's all I wanted \u2014 just two practices.
p90
aV"Can I just sit in and see what you do?"
p91
aVAnd he said, "Well, we should meet first, before we decide anything."
p92
aVYou know, he's thinking, "What am I getting myself into?"
p93
aVSo, I met the man, walked in his office,
p94
aVand saw these posters and magazine covers of people he has coached.
p95
aVAnd we got to talking,
p96
aVand it turned out to be a great partnership
p97
aVbecause he'd never coached a disabled athlete,
p98
aVso therefore he had no preconceived notions
p99
aVof what I was or wasn't capable of,
p100
aVand I'd never been coached before.
p101
aVSo this was like, "Here we go \u2014 let's start on this trip."
p102
aa(lp103
VSo he started giving me four days a week of his lunch break,
p104
aVhis free time, and I would come up to the track and train with him.
p105
aVSo that's how I met Frank.
p106
aVThat was fall of '95. But then, by the time that winter was rolling around,
p107
aVhe said, "You know, you're good enough.
p108
aVYou can run on our women's track team here."
p109
aVAnd I said, "No, come on."
p110
aVAnd he said, "No, no, really. You can.
p111
aVYou can run with our women's track team."
p112
aVIn the spring of 1996, with my goal of making the U.S. Paralympic team
p113
aVthat May coming up full speed, I joined the women's track team.
p114
aVAnd no disabled person had ever done that \u2014 run at a collegiate level.
p115
aVSo I don't know, it started to become an interesting mix.
p116
aa(lp117
VSS: Well, on your way to the Olympics,
p118
aVa couple of memorable events happened at Georgetown.
p119
aVWhy don't you just tell them?
p120
aVAM: Yes, well, you know, I'd won everything as far as the disabled meets \u2014
p121
aVeverything I competed in \u2014 and, you know, training in Georgetown
p122
aVand knowing that I was going to have to get used to
p123
aVseeing the backs of all these women's shirts \u2014
p124
aVyou know, I'm running against the next Flo-Jo \u2014
p125
aVand they're all looking at me like,
p126
aV"Hmm, what's, you know, what's going on here?"
p127
aVAnd putting on my Georgetown uniform
p128
aVand going out there and knowing that, you know,
p129
aVin order to become better \u2014 and I'm already the best in the country \u2014
p130
aVyou know, you have to train with people who are inherently better than you.
p131
aa(lp132
VAnd I went out there and made it to the Big East,
p133
aVwhich was sort of the championship race at the end of the season.
p134
aVIt was really, really hot.
p135
aVAnd it's the first \u2014
p136
aVI had just gotten these new sprinting legs that you see in that bio,
p137
aVand I didn't realize at that time that
p138
aVthe amount of sweating I would be doing in the sock \u2014
p139
aVit actually acted like a lubricant
p140
aVand I'd be, kind of, pistoning in the socket.
p141
aVAnd at about 85 meters of my 100 meters sprint, in all my glory,
p142
aVI came out of my leg.
p143
aVLike, I almost came out of it, in front of, like, 5,000 people.
p144
aVAnd I, I mean, was just mortified \u2014
p145
aVbecause I was signed up for the 200, you know, which went off in a half hour.
p146
aa(lp147
V(Laughter)
p148
aa(lp149
VI went to my coach: "Please, don't make me do this."
p150
aVI can't do this in front of all those people. My legs will come off.
p151
aVAnd if it came off at 85 there's no way I'm going 200 meters.
p152
aVAnd he just sat there like this.
p153
aVMy pleas fell on deaf ears, thank god.
p154
aVBecause you know, the man is from Brooklyn;
p155
aVhe's a big man. He says, "Aimee, so what if your leg falls off?
p156
aVYou pick it up, you put the damn thing back on,
p157
aVand finish the goddamn race!"
p158
aa(lp159
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p160
aVAnd I did. So, he kept me in line.
p161
aVHe kept me on the right track.
p162
aa(lp163
VSS: So, then Aimee makes it to the 1996 Paralympics,
p164
aVand she's all excited. Her family's coming down \u2014 it's a big deal.
p165
aVIt's now two years that you've been running?
p166
aa(lp167
VAM: No, a year.
p168
aa(lp169
VSS: A year. And why don't you tell them what happened
p170
aVright before you go run your race?
p171
aa(lp172
VAM: Okay, well, Atlanta.
p173
aVThe Paralympics, just for a little bit of clarification,
p174
aVare the Olympics for people with physical disabilities \u2014
p175
aVamputees, persons with cerebral palsy, and wheelchair athletes \u2014
p176
aVas opposed to the Special Olympics,
p177
aVwhich deals with people with mental disabilities.
p178
aVSo, here we are, a week after the Olympics and down at Atlanta,
p179
aVand I'm just blown away by the fact that
p180
aVjust a year ago, I got out on a gravel track and couldn't run 50 meters.
p181
aVAnd so, here I am \u2014 never lost.
p182
aVI set new records at the U.S. Nationals \u2014 the Olympic trials \u2014 that May,
p183
aVand was sure that I was coming home with the gold.
p184
aVI was also the only, what they call "bilateral BK" \u2014 below the knee.
p185
aVI was the only woman who would be doing the long jump.
p186
aVI had just done the long jump,
p187
aVand a guy who was missing two legs came up to me and says,
p188
aV"How do you do that? You know, we're supposed to have a planar foot,
p189
aVso we can't get off on the springboard."
p190
aVI said, "Well, I just did it. No one told me that."
p191
aa(lp192
VSo, it's funny \u2014 I'm three inches within the world record \u2014
p193
aVand kept on from that point, you know,
p194
aVso I'm signed up in the long jump \u2014 signed up?
p195
aVNo, I made it for the long jump and the 100-meter.
p196
aVAnd I'm sure of it, you know?
p197
aVI made the front page of my hometown paper
p198
aVthat I delivered for six years, you know?
p199
aVIt was, like, this is my time for shine.
p200
aVAnd we're at the trainee warm-up track,
p201
aVwhich is a few blocks away from the Olympic stadium.
p202
aVThese legs that I was on, which I'll take out right now \u2014
p203
aVI was the first person in the world on these legs.
p204
aVI was the guinea pig., I'm telling you,
p205
aVthis was, like \u2014 talk about a tourist attraction.
p206
aa(lp207
VEveryone was taking pictures \u2014 "What is this girl running on?"
p208
aVAnd I'm always looking around, like, where is my competition?
p209
aVIt's my first international meet.
p210
aVI tried to get it out of anybody I could,
p211
aVyou know, "Who am I running against here?"
p212
aV"Oh, Aimee, we'll have to get back to you on that one."
p213
aVI wanted to find out times.
p214
aV"Don't worry, you're doing great."
p215
aVThis is 20 minutes before my race in the Olympic stadium,
p216
aVand they post the heat sheets. And I go over and look.
p217
aVAnd my fastest time, which was the world record, was 15.77.
p218
aVThen I'm looking: the next lane, lane two, is 12.8.
p219
aVLane three is 12.5. Lane four is 12.2. I said, "What's going on?"
p220
aVAnd they shove us all into the shuttle bus,
p221
aVand all the women there are missing a hand.
p222
aa(lp223
V(Laughter)
p224
aa(lp225
VSo, I'm just, like \u2014
p226
aVthey're all looking at me like 'which one of these is not like the other,' you know?
p227
aVI'm sitting there, like, "Oh, my god. Oh, my god."
p228
aVYou know, I'd never lost anything,
p229
aVlike, whether it would be the scholarship or, you know,
p230
aVI'd won five golds when I skied. In everything, I came in first.
p231
aVAnd Georgetown \u2014 that was great.
p232
aVI was losing, but it was the best training because this was Atlanta.
p233
aVHere we are, like, crème de la crème,
p234
aVand there is no doubt about it, that I'm going to lose big.
p235
aVAnd, you know, I'm just thinking,
p236
aV"Oh, my god, my whole family got in a van
p237
aVand drove down here from Pennsylvania."
p238
aVAnd, you know, I was the only female U.S. sprinter.
p239
aVSo they call us out and, you know \u2014
p240
aV"Ladies, you have one minute."
p241
aVAnd I remember putting my blocks in and just feeling horrified
p242
aVbecause there was just this murmur coming over the crowd,
p243
aVlike, the ones who are close enough to the starting line to see.
p244
aVAnd I'm like, "I know! Look! This isn't right."
p245
aVAnd I'm thinking that's my last card to play here;
p246
aVif I'm not going to beat these girls,
p247
aVI'm going to mess their heads a little, you know?
p248
aa(lp249
V(Laughter)
p250
aa(lp251
VI mean, it was definitely the "Rocky IV" sensation of me versus Germany,
p252
aVand everyone else \u2014 Estonia and Poland \u2014 was in this heat.
p253
aVAnd the gun went off, and all I remember was
p254
aVfinishing last and
p255
aVfighting back tears of frustration and incredible \u2014 incredible \u2014
p256
aVthis feeling of just being overwhelmed.
p257
aVAnd I had to think, "Why did I do this?"
p258
aVIf I had won everything \u2014 but it was like, what was the point?
p259
aVAll this training \u2014 I had transformed my life.
p260
aVI became a collegiate athlete, you know. I became an Olympic athlete.
p261
aVAnd it made me really think about how
p262
aVthe achievement was getting there.
p263
aVI mean, the fact that I set my sights, just a year and three months before,
p264
aVon becoming an Olympic athlete and saying,
p265
aV"Here's my life going in this direction \u2014
p266
aVand I want to take it here for a while,
p267
aVand just seeing how far I could push it."
p268
aa(lp269
VAnd the fact that I asked for help \u2014 how many people jumped on board?
p270
aVHow many people gave of their time and their expertise,
p271
aVand their patience, to deal with me?
p272
aVAnd that was this collective glory \u2014
p273
aVthat there was, you know, 50 people behind me
p274
aVthat had joined in this incredible experience of going to Atlanta.
p275
aVSo, I apply this sort of philosophy now
p276
aVto everything I do:
p277
aVsitting back and realizing the progression,
p278
aVhow far you've come at this day to this goal, you know.
p279
aVIt's important to focus on a goal, I think, but
p280
aValso recognize the progression on the way there
p281
aVand how you've grown as a person.
p282
aVThat's the achievement, I think. That's the real achievement.
p283
aa(lp284
VSS: Why don't you show them your legs?
p285
aa(lp286
VAM: Oh, sure.
p287
aVSS: You know, show us more than one set of legs.
p288
aa(lp289
VAM: Well, these are my pretty legs.
p290
aa(lp291
V(Laughter)
p292
aa(lp293
VNo, these are my cosmetic legs, actually,
p294
aVand they're absolutely beautiful.
p295
aVYou've got to come up and see them.
p296
aVThere are hair follicles on them, and I can paint my toenails.
p297
aVAnd, seriously, like, I can wear heels.
p298
aVLike, you guys don't understand what that's like
p299
aVto be able to just go into a shoe store and buy whatever you want.
p300
aVSS: You got to pick your height?
p301
aVAM: I got to pick my height, exactly.
p302
aa(lp303
V(Laughter)
p304
aa(lp305
VPatrick Ewing, who played for Georgetown in the '80s,
p306
aVcomes back every summer.
p307
aVAnd I had incessant fun making fun of him in the training room
p308
aVbecause he'd come in with foot injuries.
p309
aVI'm like, "Get it off! Don't worry about it, you know.
p310
aVYou can be eight feet tall. Just take them off."
p311
aa(lp312
V(Laughter)
p313
aa(lp314
VHe didn't find it as humorous as I did, anyway.
p315
aVOK, now, these are my sprinting legs, made of carbon graphite,
p316
aVlike I said, and I've got to make sure I've got the right socket.
p317
aVNo, I've got so many legs in here.
p318
aVThese are \u2014 do you want to hold that actually?
p319
aVThat's another leg I have for, like, tennis and softball.
p320
aVIt has a shock absorber in it so it, like, "Shhhh," makes this neat sound
p321
aVwhen you jump around on it. All right.
p322
aVAnd then this is the silicon sheath I roll over,
p323
aVto keep it on. Which, when I sweat,
p324
aVyou know, I'm pistoning out of it.
p325
aa(lp326
VSS: Are you a different height?
p327
aa(lp328
VAM: In these?
p329
aa(lp330
VSS: In these.
p331
aa(lp332
VAM: I don't know. I don't think so.
p333
aVI may be a little taller. I actually can put both of them on.
p334
aa(lp335
VSS: She can't really stand on these legs. She has to be moving, so ...
p336
aa(lp337
VAM: Yeah, I definitely have to be moving,
p338
aVand balance is a little bit of an art in them.
p339
aVBut without having the silicon sock, I'm just going to try slip in it.
p340
aVAnd so, I run on these, and have shocked half the world on these.
p341
aa(lp342
V(Applause)
p343
aa(lp344
VThese are supposed to simulate the actual form of a sprinter when they run.
p345
aVIf you ever watch a sprinter,
p346
aVthe ball of their foot is the only thing that ever hits the track.
p347
aVSo when I stand in these legs,
p348
aVmy hamstring and my glutes are contracted,
p349
aVas they would be had I had feet and were standing on the ball of my feet.
p350
aa(lp351
V(Audience: Who made them?)
p352
aa(lp353
VAM: It's a company in San Diego called Flex-Foot.
p354
aVAnd I was a guinea pig, as I hope to continue to be
p355
aVin every new form of prosthetic limbs that come out.
p356
aVBut actually these, like I said, are still the actual prototype.
p357
aVI need to get some new ones because the last meet I was at, they were everywhere. You know,
p358
aVit's like a big \u2014 it's come full circle.
p359
aa(lp360
VModerator: Aimee and the designer of them will be at TEDMED 2,
p361
aVand we'll talk about the design of them.
p362
aa(lp363
VAM: Yes, we'll do that.
p364
aa(lp365
VSS: Yes, there you go.
p366
aa(lp367
VAM: So, these are the sprint legs, and I can put my other...
p368
aa(lp369
VSS: Can you tell about who designed your other legs?
p370
aa(lp371
VAM: Yes. These I got in a place called Bournemouth, England,
p372
aVabout two hours south of London,
p373
aVand I'm the only person in the United States with these,
p374
aVwhich is a crime because they are so beautiful.
p375
aVAnd I don't even mean, like, because of the toes and everything.
p376
aVFor me, while I'm such a serious athlete on the track,
p377
aVI want to be feminine off the track, and I think it's so important
p378
aVnot to be limited in any capacity,
p379
aVwhether it's, you know, your mobility or even fashion.
p380
aVI mean, I love the fact that I can go in anywhere
p381
aVand pick out what I want \u2014 the shoes I want, the skirts I want \u2014
p382
aVand I'm hoping to try to bring these over here
p383
aVand make them accessible to a lot of people.
p384
aVThey're also silicon.
p385
aVThis is a really basic, basic prosthetic limb under here.
p386
aVIt's like a Barbie foot under this.
p387
aa(lp388
V(Laughter)
p389
aa(lp390
VIt is. It's just stuck in this position,
p391
aVso I have to wear a two-inch heel.
p392
aVAnd, I mean, it's really \u2014 let me take this off so you can see it.
p393
aVI don't know how good you can see it, but, like, it really is.
p394
aVThere're veins on the feet, and then my heel is pink,
p395
aVand my Achilles' tendon \u2014 that moves a little bit.
p396
aVAnd it's really an amazing store. I got them a year and two weeks ago.
p397
aVAnd this is just a silicon piece of skin.
p398
aVI mean, what happened was, two years ago
p399
