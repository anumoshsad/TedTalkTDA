VWhat would be a good end of life?
p4
aVAnd I'm talking about the very end.
p5
aVI'm talking about dying.
p6
aa(lp7
VWe all think a lot about how to live well.
p8
aVI'd like to talk about increasing our chances of dying well.
p9
aVI'm not a geriatrician.
p10
aVI design reading programs for preschoolers.
p11
aVWhat I know about this topic
p12
aVcomes from a qualitative study with a sample size of two.
p13
aVIn the last few years, I helped two friends
p14
aVhave the end of life they wanted.
p15
aVJim and Shirley Modini spent their 68 years of marriage
p16
aVliving off the grid on their 1,700-acre ranch
p17
aVin the mountains of Sonoma County.
p18
aVThey kept just enough livestock to make ends meet
p19
aVso that the majority of their ranch would remain a refuge
p20
aVfor the bears and lions and so many other things
p21
aVthat lived there.
p22
aVThis was their dream.
p23
aa(lp24
VI met Jim and Shirley in their 80s.
p25
aVThey were both only children who chose not to have kids.
p26
aVAs we became friends, I became their trustee
p27
aVand their medical advocate,
p28
aVbut more importantly, I became
p29
aVthe person who managed their end-of-life experiences.
p30
aVAnd we learned a few things about how to have a good end.
p31
aa(lp32
VIn their final years, Jim and Shirley
p33
aVfaced cancers, fractures, infections, neurological illness.
p34
aVIt's true.
p35
aVAt the end, our bodily functions
p36
aVand independence are declining to zero.
p37
aVWhat we found is that, with a plan and the right people,
p38
aVquality of life can remain high.
p39
aVThe beginning of the end is triggered
p40
aVby a mortality awareness event, and during this time,
p41
aVJim and Shirley chose ACR nature preserves
p42
aVto take their ranch over when they were gone.
p43
aVThis gave them the peace of mind to move forward.
p44
aVIt might be a diagnosis. It might be your intuition.
p45
aVBut one day, you're going to say, "This thing is going to get me."
p46
aVJim and Shirley spent this time
p47
aVletting friends know that their end was near
p48
aVand that they were okay with that.
p49
aa(lp50
VDying from cancer and dying from neurological illness
p51
aVare different.
p52
aVIn both cases, last days are about quiet reassurance.
p53
aVJim died first. He was conscious until the very end,
p54
aVbut on his last day he couldn't talk.
p55
aVThrough his eyes, we knew when he needed to hear again,
p56
aV"It is all set, Jim. We're going to take care of Shirley
p57
aVright here at the ranch,
p58
aVand ACR's going to take care of your wildlife forever."
p59
aa(lp60
VFrom this experience I'm going to share five practices.
p61
aVI've put worksheets online,
p62
aVso if you'd like, you can plan your own end.
p63
aa(lp64
VIt starts with a plan.
p65
aVMost people say, "I'd like to die at home."
p66
aVEighty percent of Americans die in a hospital
p67
aVor a nursing home.
p68
aVSaying we'd like to die at home is not a plan.
p69
aVA lot of people say, "If I get like that, just shoot me."
p70
aVThis is not a plan either; this is illegal.
p71
aV(Laughter)
p72
aVA plan involves answering
p73
aVstraightforward questions about the end you want.
p74
aVWhere do you want to be when you're no longer independent?
p75
aVWhat do you want in terms of medical intervention?
p76
aVAnd who's going to make sure your plan is followed?
p77
aa(lp78
VYou will need advocates.
p79
aVHaving more than one increases your chance
p80
aVof getting the end you want.
p81
aVDon't assume the natural choice is your spouse or child.
p82
aVYou want someone who has the time and proximity
p83
aVto do this job well, and you want someone
p84
aVwho can work with people under the pressure
p85
aVof an ever-changing situation.
p86
aa(lp87
VHospital readiness is critical.
p88
aVYou are likely to be headed to the emergency room,
p89
aVand you want to get this right.
p90
aVPrepare a one-page summary of your medical history,
p91
aVmedications and physician information.
p92
aVPut this in a really bright envelope
p93
aVwith copies of your insurance cards, your power of attorney,
p94
aVand your do-not-resuscitate order.
p95
aVHave advocates keep a set in their car.
p96
aVTape a set to your refrigerator.
p97
aVWhen you show up in the E.R. with this packet,
p98
aVyour admission is streamlined in a material way.
p99
aa(lp100
VYou're going to need caregivers.
p101
aVYou'll need to assess your personality and financial situation
p102
aVto determine whether an elder care community
p103
aVor staying at home is your best choice.
p104
aVIn either case, do not settle.
p105
aVWe went through a number of not-quite-right caregivers
p106
aVbefore we found the perfect team
p107
aVled by Marsha,
p108
aVwho won't let you win at bingo just because you're dying
p109
aVbut will go out and take videos of your ranch for you
p110
aVwhen you can't get out there,
p111
aVand Caitlin, who won't let you skip your morning exercises
p112
aVbut knows when you need to hear
p113
aVthat your wife is in good hands.
p114
aa(lp115
VFinally, last words.
p116
aVWhat do you want to hear at the very end,
p117
aVand from whom would you like to hear it?
p118
aVIn my experience, you'll want to hear
p119
aVthat whatever you're worried about is going to be fine.
p120
aVWhen you believe it's okay to let go, you will.
p121
aa(lp122
VSo, this is a topic that normally inspires fear and denial.
p123
aVWhat I've learned
p124
aVis if we put some time into planning our end of life,
p125
aVwe have the best chance of maintaining our quality of life.
p126
aVHere are Jim and Shirley just after deciding
p127
aVwho would take care of their ranch.
p128
aVHere's Jim just a few weeks before he died,
p129
aVcelebrating a birthday he didn't expect to see.
p130
aVAnd here's Shirley just a few days before she died
p131
aVbeing read an article in that day's paper
p132
aVabout the significance of the wildlife refuge
p133
aVat the Modini ranch.
p134
aa(lp135
VJim and Shirley had a good end of life,
p136
aVand by sharing their story with you,
p137
aVI hope to increase our chances of doing the same.
p138
aa(lp139
VThank you.
