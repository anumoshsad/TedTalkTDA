VI'm a historian.
p4
aVSteve told us about the future of little technology;
p5
aVI'm going to show you some of the past of big technology.
p6
aVThis was a project to build a 4,000-ton nuclear bomb-propelled spaceship
p7
aVand go to Saturn and Jupiter.
p8
aVThis took place in my childhood, 1957-65.
p9
aVIt was deeply classified.
p10
aVI'm going to show you some stuff that not only has not been declassified,
p11
aVbut has now been reclassified.
p12
aa(lp13
V(Laughter)
p14
aa(lp15
VIf all goes well, next year I'll be back,
p16
aVand I'll have a lot more to show you, and if all doesn't go well,
p17
aVI'll be in jail, like Wen Ho Lee.
p18
aa(lp19
V(Laughter)
p20
aa(lp21
VSo, this ship was basically the size of the Marriott Hotel,
p22
aVa little taller and a little bigger.
p23
aVAnd one of the people who worked on it at the beginning
p24
aVwas my father, Freeman, there in the middle.
p25
aVThat's me and my sister, Esther, who's a frequent TEDster.
p26
aVI didn't like nuclear bomb-propelled spaceships.
p27
aVI mean, I thought it was a great idea, but I started building kayaks.
p28
aVSo we had a few kayaks.
p29
aVJust so you know that I am not Dr. Strangelove.
p30
aa(lp31
VBut all the time I was out there doing these strange kayak voyages
p32
aVin odd, beautiful parts of this planet,
p33
aVI always thought in the back of my mind about Project Orion,
p34
aVand how my father and his friends were going to build these big ships.
p35
aVThey were actually going to go \u2014
p36
aVTed Taylor, who led the project, was going to take his children.
p37
aVMy father was not going to take his children,
p38
aVthat was one of the reasons we sort of had a falling out for a few years.
p39
aa(lp40
V(Laughter)
p41
aa(lp42
VThe project began in '57 at General Atomics there,
p43
aVthat's right on the coast at La Jolla.
p44
aVLook at that central building right in the middle of the picture.
p45
aVThat's the 130-foot diameter library.
p46
aVThat is exactly the size of the base of the spaceship.
p47
aVSo put that library at the bottom of that ship \u2014
p48
aVthat's how big the thing was going to be.
p49
aVIt would take two or three thousand bombs.
p50
aVThe people who worked on it were a lot of the Los Alamos people
p51
aVwho had done the hydrogen bomb work.
p52
aVIt was the first project funded by ARPA.
p53
aVThat's the contract where ARPA gave the first million dollars
p54
aVto get this thing started.
p55
aV"Spaceship project officially begun. Job waiting for you. Dyson."
p56
aVThat's July '58.
p57
aVTwo days later, the space traveler's manifesto explaining why \u2014
p58
aVjust like we heard yesterday \u2014 why we need to go into space:
p59
aV"... trips to satellites of the outer planets.
p60
aVAugust 20, 1958."
p61
aa(lp62
VThese are the statistics of what would be the good places to go and stop.
p63
aVSome of the sizes of the ships,
p64
aVranging all the way up to ship mass of 8 million tons.
p65
aVSo that was the outer extreme.
p66
aVHere was version two: 2,000 bombs.
p67
aVThese are five-kiloton yield bombs, about the size of small Volkswagens;
p68
aVit would take 800 to get into orbit.
p69
aVHere we see a 10,000-ton ship will deliver 1,300 tons
p70
aVto Saturn and back \u2014 essentially, a five-year trip.
p71
aVPossible departure dates: October 1960 to February 1967.
p72
aVThese are trajectories going to Mars.
p73
aVAll this was done by hand, with slide rules.
p74
aVThe little Orion ship,
p75
aVand what it would take to do what Orion does with chemicals:
p76
aVyou have a ship the size of the Empire State Building.
p77
aa(lp78
VNASA had no interest; they tried to kill the project.
p79
aVThe people who supported it were the Air Force,
p80
aVwhich meant that it was all secret.
p81
aVAnd that's why when you get something declassified, that's what it looks like.
p82
aVMilitary weapon versions that carried hydrogen bombs
p83
aVthat could destroy half the planet.
p84
aVThere's another version there that sends retaliatory strikes at the Soviet Union.
p85
aVThis is the really secret stuff:
p86
aVhow to get directed energy explosions.
p87
aVSo you're sending the energy of a nuclear explosion \u2014
p88
aVnot like just a stick of dynamite, but you're directing it at the ship.
p89
aVAnd this is still a very active subject.
p90
aVIt's quite dangerous,
p91
aVbut I believe it's better to have dangerous things in the open
p92
aVthan think you're going to keep them secret.
p93
aa(lp94
VThis is what happened at 600 microseconds.
p95
aVThe Air Force started to build smaller models
p96
aVand actually started doing this.
p97
aVThe guys in La Jolla said, "We've got to get started now."
p98
aVThey built a high-explosive propelled model.
p99
aVThese are stills from film footage that was saved
p100
aVby someone who was supposed to destroy it but didn't,
p101
aVand kept it in their basement for the last 40 years.
p102
aVSo, these are three-pound charges of C4;
p103
aVthat's about 10 times what the guy had in his shoes.
p104
aa(lp105
V(Laughter)
p106
aa(lp107
VThis is Ed Day putting \u2014
p108
aVSo each of these coffee cans has three pounds of C4 in it.
p109
aVThey're building a system that ejects these at quarter-second intervals.
p110
aVThat's my dad in the sport coat there, holding the briefcase.
p111
aVSo, they had a lot of fun doing this.
p112
aVBut no children were allowed;
p113
aVmy dad could tell me he was building a spaceship and going to go to Saturn,
p114
aVbut he could not say anything more about it.
p115
aa(lp116
VSo all my life I have wanted to find this stuff out,
p117
aVand spent the last four years tracking these old guys down.
p118
aVThese are stills from the video.
p119
aVJeff Bezos kindly, yesterday, said he'll put this video up
p120
aVon the Amazon site \u2014 some little clip of it.
p121
aa(lp122
V(Applause)
p123
aa(lp124
VSo, thanks to him.
p125
aVThey got quite serious about the engineering of this.
p126
aVThe size of that mass, for us,
p127
aVis really large technology in a way we're never going to go back to.
p128
aVIf you saw the 1959 \u2014
p129
aVthis is what it would feel like in the passenger compartment;
p130
aVthat's acceleration profile.
p131
aa(lp132
V(Laughter)
p133
aa(lp134
VAnd pulse-system yield: we're looking at 20-kiloton yield
p135
aVfor an effective thrust of 10 million newtons.
p136
aVWell, here we have a little problem, the radiation doses at the crew station:
p137
aV700 rads per shot.
p138
aa(lp139
V(Laughter)
p140
aa(lp141
VFission yields during development:
p142
aVthey were hoping to get clean bombs; they didn't.
p143
aVEyeburn: this is what happens to the people in Miami who are looking up.
p144
aa(lp145
V(Laughter)
p146
aa(lp147
VPersonnel compartment noise: that's not too bad; it's very low frequencies,
p148
aVit's basically like these sub-woofers.
p149
aVAnd now we have ground-hazard assessments when you have a blow-up on the pad.
p150
aVFinally, at the very end in 1964, NASA steps in and says,
p151
aV"OK, we'll support a feasibility study for a small version
p152
aVthat could be launched with Saturn Vs in sections and pieced together."
p153
aa(lp154
VSo this is what NASA did,
p155
aVgetting an eight-man version that would go to Mars.
p156
aVThey liked it because the guys could kind of live there and be like,
p157
aV"It's like living in a submarine."
p158
aVThis is crew compartment.
p159
aVIt switches, so what's upside down is right side up
p160
aVwhen you go to artificial gravity mode.
p161
aVThe scientists were still going to go along;
p162
aVthey would take seven astronauts and seven scientists.
p163
aVThis is a 20-man version for going to Jupiter:
p164
aVbunks, storm cellars, exercise room.
p165
aVYou know, it was going to be a nice, long trip.
p166
aa(lp167
VThe Air Force version: here we have a military version.
p168
aVThis is the kind of stuff that's not been declassified,
p169
aVjust that people managed to sneak home and after, you know,
p170
aVon their deathbed, basically, gave me that.
p171
aVThe sort of artist conceptions.
p172
aVThese are basically PowerPoint presentations
p173
aVgiven to the Air Force 40 years ago.
p174
aVLook at the little guys there outside the vehicle.
p175
aVAnd one part of NASA was interested in it,
p176
aVbut the headquarters in NASA, they killed the project.
p177
aVSo finally, at the end,
p178
aVwe can see the thing followed its sort of design path right up to 1965,
p179
aVand then all those paths came to a halt.
p180
aa(lp181
VResults: none.
p182
aVThis project is hereby terminated.
p183
aVSo that's the end.
p184
aa(lp185
VAll I can say in closing is:
p186
aVwe heard yesterday that one of the 10 bad things that could happen to us
p187
aVis an asteroid with our name on it.
p188
aVAnd one of the bad things that could happen to NASA
p189
aVis if that asteroid shows up with our name on it nine months out,
p190
aVand everybody says,
p191
aV"Well, what are we going to do?"
p192
aVAnd Orion is really one of the only, if not the only,
p193
aVoff-the-shelf technologies that could do something.
p194
aa(lp195
V(Laughter)
p196
aa(lp197
VSo I'm going to tell you the good news and the bad news.
p198
aVThe good news is that NASA has a small, secret contingency-plan division
p199
aVthat is looking at this, trying to keep knowledge of Orion preserved
p200
aVin the event of such a misfortune.
p201
aVMaybe keep a few little bombs of plutonium on the side.
p202
aVThat's the good news.
p203
aVThe bad news is, when I got in contact with these people
p204
aVto try and get some documents from them, they went crazy
p205
aVbecause I had all this stuff that they don't have,
p206
aVand NASA purchased 1,759 pages of this stuff from me.
p207
aVSo that's the state we're at; it's not very good.
