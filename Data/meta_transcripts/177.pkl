VI'm going to try to give you a view of the world as I see it,
p4
aVthe problems and the opportunities that we face,
p5
aVand then ask the question if we should be optimistic or pessimistic.
p6
aVAnd then I'll let you in on a secret, which is why I am an incurable optimist.
p7
aVLet me start off showing you an Al Gore movie that you may have seen before.
p8
aVNow, you've all seen "Inconvenient Truth." This is a little more inconvenient.
p9
aa(lp10
V(Video): Man: ... extremely dangerous questions.
p11
aVBecause, with our present knowledge, we have no idea what would happen.
p12
aVEven now, man may be unwittingly changing the world's climate
p13
aVthrough the waste products of his civilization.
p14
aVDue to our release, through factories and automobiles every year,
p15
aVof more than six billion tons of carbon dioxide \u2014
p16
aVwhich helps air absorb heat from the sun \u2014
p17
aVour atmosphere seems to be getting warmer.
p18
aVThis is bad?
p19
aVWell, it's been calculated a few degrees' rise in the earth's temperature would
p20
aVmelt the polar ice caps.
p21
aVAnd if this happens, an inland sea would fill a good portion of the Mississippi Valley.
p22
aVTourists in glass-bottomed boats would be viewing the drowned towers of Miami
p23
aVthrough 150 feet of tropical water.
p24
aVFor, in weather, we're not only dealing with forces of a far greater variety
p25
aVthan even the atomic physicist encounters, but with life itself.
p26
aa(lp27
VLarry Brilliant: Should we feel good, or should we feel bad
p28
aVthat 50 years of foreknowledge accomplished so little?
p29
aVWell, it depends, really, on what your goals are.
p30
aVAnd I think, as my goals, I always go back to Gandhi's talisman.
p31
aVWhen Mahatma Gandhi was asked,
p32
aV"How do you know if the next act that you are about to do is the right one
p33
aVor the wrong one?" he said, "Consider the face of the poorest,
p34
aVmost vulnerable human being that you ever chanced upon,
p35
aVand ask yourself if the act that you contemplate will be of benefit to that person.
p36
aVAnd if it will be, it's the right thing to do, and if not, rethink it."
p37
aa(lp38
VFor those of us in this room, it's not just the poorest and the most vulnerable individual,
p39
aVit's the community, it's the culture, it's the world itself.
p40
aVAnd the trends for those who are at the periphery of our society,
p41
aVwho are the poorest and the most vulnerable,
p42
aVthe trends give rise to a great case for pessimism.
p43
aVBut there's also a wonderful case for optimism.
p44
aVLet's review them both. First of all, the megatrends.
p45
aVThere's two degrees, or three degrees of climate change baked into the system.
p46
aVIt will cause rising seas. It will cause saline deposited into wells and into lands.
p47
aVIt will disproportionately harm the poorest and the most vulnerable,
p48
aVas will the increasing rise of population.
p49
aVEven though we've dodged Paul Ehrlich's population bomb,
p50
aVand we will not see 20 billion people in this decade, as he had forecast,
p51
aVwe eat as if we were 20 billion.
p52
aVAnd we consume so much that again, a rise of 6.5 billion to 9.5 billion
p53
aVin our grandchildren's lifetime will disproportionately hurt
p54
aVthe poorest and the most vulnerable.
p55
aa(lp56
VThat's why they migrate to cities.
p57
aVThat's why in June of this year, we passed, as a species, 51 percent of us living in cities,
p58
aVand bustees, and slums, and shantytowns.
p59
aVThe rural areas are no longer producing as much food as they did.
p60
aVThe green revolution never reached Africa.
p61
aVAnd with desertification, sandstorms, the Gobi Desert, the Ogaden,
p62
aVwe are finding increasing difficulty of a hectare
p63
aVto produce as many calories as it did even 15 years ago.
p64
aa(lp65
VSo humans are turning more towards animal consumption.
p66
aVIn Africa last year, Africans ate 600 million wild animals,
p67
aVand consumed two billion kilograms of bush meat.
p68
aVAnd every kilogram of bush meat contained hundreds of thousands of novel viruses
p69
aVthat have never been charted, the genomic sequences of which we don't know.
p70
aVTheir fitness for creating pandemics we are unaware of,
p71
aVbut we are ripe for zoonotic-borne, emerging communicable diseases.
p72
aa(lp73
VIncreasingly, I would say explosive growth of technology.
p74
aVMost of us are the beneficiaries of that growth. But it has a dark side
p75
aV\u2014 in bioweapons, and in technology that puts us on a collision course
p76
aVto magnify any anger, hatred or feeling of marginalization.
p77
aVAnd in fact, with increasing globalization \u2014
p78
aVfor which there are big winners and even bigger losers
p79
aV\u2014 today the world is more diverse and unfair than perhaps it has ever been in history.
p80
aa(lp81
VOne percent of us own 40 percent of all the goods and services.
p82
aVWhat will happen if the billion people today who live on less than one dollar a day
p83
aVrise to three billion in the next 30 years?
p84
aVThe one percent will own even more than 40 percent of all the world's goods
p85
aVand services. Not because they've grown richer,
p86
aVbut because the rest of the world has grown increasingly poorer.
p87
aVLast week, Bill Clinton at the TED Awards said,
p88
aV"This situation is unprecedented, unequal, unfair and unstable."
p89
aa(lp90
VSo there's lots of reason for pessimism.
p91
aVDarfur is, at its origin, a resource war.
p92
aVLast year, there were 85,000 riots in China,
p93
aV230 a day, that required police or military intervention.
p94
aVMost of them were about resources.
p95
aVWe are facing an unprecedented number, scale of disasters.
p96
aVSome are weather-related, human-rights related, epidemics.
p97
aVAnd the newly emerging diseases may make H5N1 and bird flu
p98
aVa quaint forerunner of things to come. It's a destabilized world.
p99
aVAnd unlike destabilized world in the past, it will be broadcast to you on YouTube,
p100
aVyou will see it on digital television and on your cell phones.
p101
aVWhat will that lead to?
p102
aVFor some, it will lead to anger, religious and sectarian violence and terrorism.
p103
aVFor others, withdrawal, nihilism, materialism.
p104
aVFor us, where does it take us, as social activists and entrepreneurs?
p105
aVAs we look at these trends, do we become despondent, or will we become energized?
p106
aa(lp107
VLet's look at one case, the case of Bangladesh.
p108
aVFirst, even if carbon dioxide emissions stopped today,
p109
aVglobal warming would continue.
p110
aVAnd even with global warming \u2014 if you can see these blue lines,
p111
aVthe dotted line shows that even if emissions of greenhouse gasses stopped today,
p112
aVthe next decades will see rising sea levels.
p113
aVA minimum of 20 to 30 inches of increase in sea levels is the best case
p114
aVthat we can hope for, and it could be 10 times that.
p115
aVWhat will that do to Bangladesh? Let's take a look.
p116
aVSo here's Bangladesh.
p117
aV70 percent of Bangladesh is at less than five feet above sea level.
p118
aVLet's go up and take a look at the Himalayas.
p119
aVAnd we'll watch as global warming makes them melt. More water comes down,
p120
aVthe deforested areas, here in the Tarai, will be unable to absorb the effluent,
p121
aVbecause trees are like straws that suck up the extra seasonal water.
p122
aVNow we're looking down south, through the Kali Gandaki.
p123
aVMany of you, I think, have probably trekked here.
p124
aVAnd we're going to cruise down and take a look at Bangladesh
p125
aVand see what the impact will be of twin increases in water
p126
aVcoming from the north, and in the seas rising from the south.
p127
aVLooking at the five major rivers that feed Bangladesh.
p128
aVAnd now let's look from the south, looking up, and let's see this in relief.
p129
aVA minimum of 20 to 40 inches of increase in seas,
p130
aVcoupled with increasing flows from the Himalayas. And take a look at this.
p131
aVAs many as 100 million refugees from Bangladesh could be expected to migrate
p132
aVinto India and into China.
p133
aVThis is the difficulty that one country faces.
p134
aa(lp135
VBut if you look at the globe, all around the earth, wherever there is low-lying area,
p136
aVpopulated areas near the water,
p137
aVyou will find increase in sea level that will challenge our way of life.
p138
aVSub-Saharan Africa, and even our own San Francisco Bay Area.
p139
aVWe're all in this together.
p140
aVThis is not something that happens far away to people that we don't know.
p141
aVGlobal warming is something that happens to all of us, all at once.
p142
aa(lp143
VAs are these newly emerging communicable diseases,
p144
aVnames that you hadn't heard 20 years ago: ebola, lhasa fever, monkey pox.
p145
aVWith the erosion of the green belt separating animals from humans,
p146
aVwe live in each other's viral environment.
p147
aVDo you remember, 20 years ago, no one had ever heard of West Nile fever?
p148
aVAnd then we watched, as one case arrived on the East Coast of the United States
p149
aVand it marched every year, westwardly.
p150
aVDo you remember no one had heard of ebola
p151
aVuntil we heard of hundreds of people dying in Central Africa from it?
p152
aVIt's just the beginning, unfortunately.
p153
aVThere have been 30 novel emerging communicable diseases
p154
aVthat begin in animals that have jumped species in the last 30 years.
p155
aVIt's more than enough reason for pessimism.
p156
aa(lp157
VBut now let's look at the case for optimism. (Laughter)
p158
aVEnough of the bad news. Human beings have always risen to the challenge.
p159
aVYou just need to look at the list of Nobel laureates to remind ourselves.
p160
aVWe've been here before, paralyzed by fear, paralyzed into inaction,
p161
aVwhen some \u2014 probably one of you in this room \u2014 jumped into the breach
p162
aVand created an organization like Physicians for Social Responsibility,
p163
aVwhich fought against the nuclear threat,
p164
aVMedicins Sans Frontieres, that renewed our commitment to disaster relief,
p165
aVMohamed ElBaradei, and the tremendous hope and optimism that he
p166
aVbrought all of us, and our own Muhammad Yunus.
p167
aa(lp168
VWe've seen the eradication of smallpox.
p169
aVWe may see the eradication of polio this year.
p170
aVLast year, there were only 2,000 cases in the world.
p171
aVWe may see the eradication of guinea worm next year \u2014
p172
aVthere are only 35,000 cases left in the world.
p173
aV20 years ago, there were three and a half million.
p174
aVAnd we've seen a new disease, not like the 30 novel emerging communicable diseases.
p175
aVThis disease is called sudden wealth syndrome. (Laughter)
p176
aVIt's an amazing phenomenon.
p177
aVAll throughout the technology world, we're seeing young people bitten by this
p178
aVdisease of sudden wealth syndrome.
p179
aVBut they're using their wealth in a way that their forefathers never did.
p180
aVThey're not waiting until they die to create foundations.
p181
aVThey're actively guiding their money, their resources, their hearts, their commitments,
p182
aVto make the world a better place.
p183
aVCertainly, nothing can give you more optimism than that.
p184
aa(lp185
VMore reasons to be optimistic:
p186
aVin the '60s, and I am a creature of the '60s, there was a movement.
p187
aVWe all felt that we were part of it, that a better world was right around the corner,
p188
aVthat we were watching the birth of a world free of hatred and violence and prejudice.
p189
aVToday, there's another kind of movement. It's a movement to save the earth.
p190
aVIt's just beginning.
p191
aVFive weeks ago, a group of activists from the business community gathered together
p192
aVto stop a Texas utility from building nine coal-fired electrical plants
p193
aVthat would have contributed to destroying the environment.
p194
aVSix months ago, a group of business activists gathered together to join with the
p195
aVRepublican governor in California to pass AB 32,
p196
aVthe most far-reaching legislation in environmental history.
p197
aa(lp198
VAl Gore made presentations in the House and the Senate as an expert witness.
p199
aVCan you imagine? (Laughter)
p200
aVWe're seeing an entente cordiale between science and religion that five years ago
p201
aVI would not have believed, as the evangelical community
p202
aVhas understood the desperate situation of global warming.
p203
aVAnd now 4,000 churches have joined the environmental movement.
p204
aVIt is something to be greatly optimistic about.
p205
aVThe European 20-20-20 plan is an amazing breakthrough,
p206
aVsomething that should make all of us feel that hope is on the horizon.
p207
aVAnd on April 14th, there will be Step Up Day, where there will be a thousand
p208
aVindividual mobilized social activist movements in the United States on protest
p209
aVagainst legislation \u2014 pushing for legislation to stop global warming.
p210
aVAnd on July 7th, around the world, I learned only yesterday,
p211
aVthere will be global Live Earth concerts.
p212
aVAnd you can feel this optimistic move to save the earth in the air.
p213
aa(lp214
VNow, that doesn't mean that people understand that global warming
p215
aVhurts the poorest and the weakest the most.
p216
aVThat means that people are beginning the first step,
p217
aVwhich is acting out of their own self-interest.
p218
aVBut I am seeing in the major funders, in CARE, Rockefeller,
p219
aVRockefeller Brothers Fund, Hewlett, Mercy Corps, you guys, Google,
p220
aVso many other organizations, a beginning of understanding that we need
p221
aVto work not just on primary prevention of global warming,
p222
aVbut on the secondary prevention of the consequences of global warming
p223
aVon the poorest and the most vulnerable.
p224
aa(lp225
VBut for me, I have another reason to be an incurable optimist.
p226
aVAnd you've heard so many inspiring stories here, and I heard so many last night
p227
aVthat I thought I would share a little bit of mine.
p228
aVMy background is not exactly conventional medical training.
p229
aVAnd I lived in a Himalayan monastery, and I studied with a very wise teacher,
p230
aVwho kicked me out of the monastery one day and told me that it was my destiny \u2014
p231
aVit felt like Yoda \u2014 it is your destiny to go to work for WHO
p232
aVand to help eradicate smallpox,
p233
aVat a time when there was no smallpox program.
p234
aa(lp235
VIt should make you optimistic that smallpox no longer exists
p236
aVbecause it was the worst disease in history.
p237
aVIn the last century \u2014 that's the one that was seven years ago \u2014
p238
aVhalf a billion people died from smallpox:
p239
aVmore than all the wars in history,
p240
aVmore than any other infectious disease in the history of the world.
p241
aVIn the Summer of Love, in 1967, two million people, children, died of smallpox.
p242
aVIt's not ancient history.
p243
aVWhen you read the biblical plague of boils, that was smallpox.
p244
aVPharaoh Ramses the Fifth, whose picture is here, died of smallpox.
p245
aVTo eradicate smallpox, we had to gather the largest United Nations army in history.
p246
aVWe visited every house in India, searching for smallpox \u2014 120 million houses,
p247
aVonce every month, for nearly two years.
p248
aVIn a cruel reversal, after we had almost conquered smallpox \u2014
p249
aVand this is what you must learn as a social entrepreneur, the realm of the final inch.
p250
aa(lp251
VWhen we had almost eradicated smallpox, it came back again,
p252
aVbecause the company town of Tatanagar drew laborers,
p253
aVwho could come there and get employment.
p254
aVAnd they caught smallpox in the one remaining place that had smallpox,
p255
aVand they went home to die.
p256
aVAnd when they did, they took smallpox to 10 other countries
p257
aVand reignited the epidemic.
p258
aVAnd we had to start all over again.
p259
aVBut, in the end, we succeeded, and the last case of smallpox:
p260
aVthis little girl, Rahima Banu \u2014 Barisal, in Bangladesh \u2014
p261
aVwhen she coughed or breathed, and the last virus of smallpox left her lungs
p262
aVand fell on the dirt and the sun killed that last virus,
p263
aVthus ended a chain of transmission of history's greatest horror.
p264
aa(lp265
VHow can that not make you optimistic?
p266
aVA disease which killed hundreds of thousands in India, and blinded half of
p267
aVall of those who were made blind in India, ended.
p268
aVAnd most importantly for us here in this room, a bond was created.
p269
aVDoctors, health workers, from 30 different countries,
p270
aVof every race, every religion, every color, worked together,
p271
aVfought alongside each other,
p272
aVfought against a common enemy, didn't fight against each other.
p273
aVHow can that not make you feel optimistic for the future?
p274
aVThank you very much.
