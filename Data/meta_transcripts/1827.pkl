VThere is an ancient proverb that says
p4
aVit's very difficult to find a black cat in a dark room,
p5
aVespecially when there is no cat.
p6
aVI find this a particularly apt description of science
p7
aVand how science works \u2014
p8
aVbumbling around in a dark room, bumping into things,
p9
aVtrying to figure out what shape this might be,
p10
aVwhat that might be,
p11
aVthere are reports of a cat somewhere around,
p12
aVthey may not be reliable, they may be,
p13
aVand so forth and so on.
p14
aa(lp15
VNow I know this is different than the way most people
p16
aVthink about science.
p17
aVScience, we generally are told,
p18
aVis a very well-ordered mechanism for
p19
aVunderstanding the world,
p20
aVfor gaining facts, for gaining data,
p21
aVthat it's rule-based,
p22
aVthat scientists use this thing called the scientific method
p23
aVand we've been doing this for 14 generations or so now,
p24
aVand the scientific method is a set of rules
p25
aVfor getting hard, cold facts out of the data.
p26
aa(lp27
VI'd like to tell you that's not the case.
p28
aVSo there's the scientific method,
p29
aVbut what's really going on is this. (Laughter)
p30
aa(lp31
V[The Scientific Method vs. Farting Around]
p32
aa(lp33
VAnd it's going on kind of like that.
p34
aa(lp35
V[... in the dark] (Laughter)
p36
aa(lp37
VSo what is the difference, then,
p38
aVbetween the way I believe science is pursued
p39
aVand the way it seems to be perceived?
p40
aVSo this difference first came to me in some ways
p41
aVin my dual role at Columbia University,
p42
aVwhere I'm both a professor and run a laboratory in neuroscience
p43
aVwhere we try to figure out how the brain works.
p44
aVWe do this by studying the sense of smell,
p45
aVthe sense of olfaction, and in the laboratory,
p46
aVit's a great pleasure and fascinating work
p47
aVand exciting to work with graduate students and post-docs
p48
aVand think up cool experiments to understand how this
p49
aVsense of smell works and how the brain might be working,
p50
aVand, well, frankly, it's kind of exhilarating.
p51
aa(lp52
VBut at the same time, it's my responsibility
p53
aVto teach a large course to undergraduates on the brain,
p54
aVand that's a big subject,
p55
aVand it takes quite a while to organize that,
p56
aVand it's quite challenging and it's quite interesting,
p57
aVbut I have to say, it's not so exhilarating.
p58
aVSo what was the difference?
p59
aVWell, the course I was and am teaching
p60
aVis called Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience - I. (Laughs)
p61
aVIt's 25 lectures full of all sorts of facts,
p62
aVit uses this giant book called "Principles of Neural Science"
p63
aVby three famous neuroscientists.
p64
aVThis book comes in at 1,414 pages,
p65
aVit weighs a hefty seven and a half pounds.
p66
aVJust to put that in some perspective,
p67
aVthat's the weight of two normal human brains.
p68
aa(lp69
V(Laughter)
p70
aa(lp71
VSo I began to realize, by the end of this course,
p72
aVthat the students maybe were getting the idea
p73
aVthat we must know everything there is to know about the brain.
p74
aVThat's clearly not true.
p75
aVAnd they must also have this idea, I suppose,
p76
aVthat what scientists do is collect data and collect facts
p77
aVand stick them in these big books.
p78
aVAnd that's not really the case either.
p79
aVWhen I go to a meeting, after the meeting day is over
p80
aVand we collect in the bar over a couple of beers with my colleagues,
p81
aVwe never talk about what we know.
p82
aVWe talk about what we don't know.
p83
aVWe talk about what still has to get done,
p84
aVwhat's so critical to get done in the lab.
p85
aVIndeed, this was, I think, best said by Marie Curie
p86
aVwho said that one never notices what has been done
p87
aVbut only what remains to be done.
p88
aVThis was in a letter to her brother after obtaining
p89
aVher second graduate degree, I should say.
p90
aa(lp91
VI have to point out this has always been one of my favorite pictures of Marie Curie,
p92
aVbecause I am convinced that that glow behind her
p93
aVis not a photographic effect. (Laughter)
p94
aVThat's the real thing.
p95
aVIt is true that her papers are, to this day,
p96
aVstored in a basement room in the Bibliothèque Française
p97
aVin a concrete room that's lead-lined,
p98
aVand if you're a scholar and you want access to these notebooks,
p99
aVyou have to put on a full radiation hazmat suit,
p100
aVso it's pretty scary business.
p101
aa(lp102
VNonetheless, this is what I think we were leaving out
p103
aVof our courses
p104
aVand leaving out of the interaction that we have
p105
aVwith the public as scientists, the what-remains-to-be-done.
p106
aVThis is the stuff that's exhilarating and interesting.
p107
aVIt is, if you will, the ignorance.
p108
aVThat's what was missing.
p109
aa(lp110
VSo I thought, well, maybe I should teach a course
p111
aVon ignorance,
p112
aVsomething I can finally excel at, perhaps, for example.
p113
aVSo I did start teaching this course on ignorance,
p114
aVand it's been quite interesting
p115
aVand I'd like to tell you to go to the website.
p116
aVYou can find all sorts of information there. It's wide open.
p117
aVAnd it's been really quite an interesting time for me
p118
aVto meet up with other scientists who come in and talk
p119
aVabout what it is they don't know.
p120
aa(lp121
VNow I use this word "ignorance," of course,
p122
aVto be at least in part intentionally provocative,
p123
aVbecause ignorance has a lot of bad connotations
p124
aVand I clearly don't mean any of those.
p125
aVSo I don't mean stupidity, I don't mean a callow indifference
p126
aVto fact or reason or data.
p127
aVThe ignorant are clearly unenlightened, unaware,
p128
aVuninformed, and present company today excepted,
p129
aVoften occupy elected offices, it seems to me.
p130
aVThat's another story, perhaps.
p131
aa(lp132
VI mean a different kind of ignorance.
p133
aVI mean a kind of ignorance that's less pejorative,
p134
aVa kind of ignorance that comes from a communal gap in our knowledge,
p135
aVsomething that's just not there to be known
p136
aVor isn't known well enough yet or we can't make predictions from,
p137
aVthe kind of ignorance that's maybe best summed up
p138
aVin a statement by James Clerk Maxwell,
p139
aVperhaps the greatest physicist between Newton and Einstein,
p140
aVwho said, "Thoroughly conscious ignorance
p141
aVis the prelude to every real advance in science."
p142
aVI think it's a wonderful idea:
p143
aVthoroughly conscious ignorance.
p144
aa(lp145
VSo that's the kind of ignorance that I want to talk about today,
p146
aVbut of course the first thing we have to clear up
p147
aVis what are we going to do with all those facts?
p148
aVSo it is true that science piles up at an alarming rate.
p149
aVWe all have this sense that science is this mountain of facts,
p150
aVthis accumulation model of science, as many have called it,
p151
aVand it seems impregnable, it seems impossible.
p152
aVHow can you ever know all of this?
p153
aVAnd indeed, the scientific literature grows at an alarming rate.
p154
aVIn 2006, there were 1.3 million papers published.
p155
aVThere's about a two-and-a-half-percent yearly growth rate,
p156
aVand so last year we saw over one and a half million papers being published.
p157
aVDivide that by the number of minutes in a year,
p158
aVand you wind up with three new papers per minute.
p159
aVSo I've been up here a little over 10 minutes,
p160
aVI've already lost three papers.
p161
aVI have to get out of here actually. I have to go read.
p162
aa(lp163
VSo what do we do about this? Well, the fact is
p164
aVthat what scientists do about it is a kind of a controlled neglect, if you will.
p165
aVWe just don't worry about it, in a way.
p166
aVThe facts are important. You have to know a lot of stuff
p167
aVto be a scientist. That's true.
p168
aVBut knowing a lot of stuff doesn't make you a scientist.
p169
aVYou need to know a lot of stuff to be a lawyer
p170
aVor an accountant or an electrician or a carpenter.
p171
aVBut in science, knowing a lot of stuff is not the point.
p172
aVKnowing a lot of stuff is there to help you get
p173
aVto more ignorance.
p174
aVSo knowledge is a big subject, but I would say
p175
aVignorance is a bigger one.
p176
aa(lp177
VSo this leads us to maybe think about, a little bit
p178
aVabout, some of the models of science that we tend to use,
p179
aVand I'd like to disabuse you of some of them.
p180
aVSo one of them, a popular one, is that scientists
p181
aVare patiently putting the pieces of a puzzle together
p182
aVto reveal some grand scheme or another.
p183
aVThis is clearly not true. For one, with puzzles,
p184
aVthe manufacturer has guaranteed that there's a solution.
p185
aVWe don't have any such guarantee.
p186
aVIndeed, there are many of us who aren't so sure about the manufacturer.
p187
aa(lp188
V(Laughter)
p189
aa(lp190
VSo I think the puzzle model doesn't work.
p191
aa(lp192
VAnother popular model is that science is busy unraveling things
p193
aVthe way you unravel the peels of an onion.
p194
aVSo peel by peel, you take away the layers of the onion
p195
aVto get at some fundamental kernel of truth.
p196
aVI don't think that's the way it works either.
p197
aVAnother one, a kind of popular one, is the iceberg idea,
p198
aVthat we only see the tip of the iceberg but underneath
p199
aVis where most of the iceberg is hidden.
p200
aVBut all of these models are based on the idea of a large body of facts
p201
aVthat we can somehow or another get completed.
p202
aVWe can chip away at this iceberg and figure out what it is,
p203
aVor we could just wait for it to melt, I suppose, these days,
p204
aVbut one way or another we could get to the whole iceberg. Right?
p205
aVOr make it manageable. But I don't think that's the case.
p206
aVI think what really happens in science
p207
aVis a model more like the magic well,
p208
aVwhere no matter how many buckets you take out,
p209
aVthere's always another bucket of water to be had,
p210
aVor my particularly favorite one,
p211
aVwith the effect and everything, the ripples on a pond.
p212
aVSo if you think of knowledge being this ever-expanding ripple on a pond,
p213
aVthe important thing to realize is that our ignorance,
p214
aVthe circumference of this knowledge, also grows with knowledge.
p215
aVSo the knowledge generates ignorance.
p216
aVThis is really well said, I thought, by George Bernard Shaw.
p217
aVThis is actually part of a toast that he delivered
p218
aVto celebrate Einstein at a dinner celebrating Einstein's work,
p219
aVin which he claims that science
p220
aVjust creates more questions than it answers. ["Science is always wrong. It never solves a problem without creating 10 more."]
p221
aa(lp222
VI find that kind of glorious, and I think he's precisely right,
p223
aVplus it's a kind of job security.
p224
aVAs it turns out, he kind of cribbed that
p225
aVfrom the philosopher Immanuel Kant
p226
aVwho a hundred years earlier had come up with this idea
p227
aVof question propagation, that every answer begets more questions.
p228
aVI love that term, "question propagation,"
p229
aVthis idea of questions propagating out there.
p230
aa(lp231
VSo I'd say the model we want to take is not
p232
aVthat we start out kind of ignorant and we get some facts together
p233
aVand then we gain knowledge.
p234
aVIt's rather kind of the other way around, really.
p235
aVWhat do we use this knowledge for?
p236
aVWhat are we using this collection of facts for?
p237
aVWe're using it to make better ignorance,
p238
aVto come up with, if you will, higher-quality ignorance.
p239
aVBecause, you know, there's low-quality ignorance
p240
aVand there's high-quality ignorance. It's not all the same.
p241
aVScientists argue about this all the time.
p242
aVSometimes we call them bull sessions.
p243
aVSometimes we call them grant proposals.
p244
aVBut nonetheless, it's what the argument is about.
p245
aVIt's the ignorance. It's the what we don't know.
p246
aVIt's what makes a good question.
p247
aa(lp248
VSo how do we think about these questions?
p249
aVI'm going to show you a graph that shows up
p250
aVquite a bit on happy hour posters in various science departments.
p251
aVThis graph asks the relationship between what you know
p252
aVand how much you know about it.
p253
aVSo what you know, you can know anywhere from nothing to everything, of course,
p254
aVand how much you know about it can be anywhere
p255
aVfrom a little to a lot.
p256
aVSo let's put a point on the graph. There's an undergraduate.
p257
aVDoesn't know much but they have a lot of interest.
p258
aVThey're interested in almost everything.
p259
aVNow you look at a master's student, a little further along in their education,
p260
aVand you see they know a bit more,
p261
aVbut it's been narrowed somewhat.
p262
aVAnd finally you get your Ph.D., where it turns out
p263
aVyou know a tremendous amount about almost nothing. (Laughter)
p264
aVWhat's really disturbing is the trend line that goes through that
p265
aVbecause, of course, when it dips below the zero axis, there,
p266
aVit gets into a negative area.
p267
aVThat's where you find people like me, I'm afraid.
p268
aa(lp269
VSo the important thing here is that this can all be changed.
p270
aVThis whole view can be changed
p271
aVby just changing the label on the x-axis.
p272
aVSo instead of how much you know about it,
p273
aVwe could say, "What can you ask about it?"
p274
aVSo yes, you do need to know a lot of stuff as a scientist,
p275
aVbut the purpose of knowing a lot of stuff
p276
aVis not just to know a lot of stuff. That just makes you a geek, right?
p277
aVKnowing a lot of stuff, the purpose is
p278
aVto be able to ask lots of questions,
p279
aVto be able to frame thoughtful, interesting questions,
p280
aVbecause that's where the real work is.
p281
aa(lp282
VLet me give you a quick idea of a couple of these sorts of questions.
p283
aVI'm a neuroscientist, so how would we come up
p284
aVwith a question in neuroscience?
p285
aVBecause it's not always quite so straightforward.
p286
aVSo, for example, we could say, well what is it that the brain does?
p287
aVWell, one thing the brain does, it moves us around.
p288
aVWe walk around on two legs.
p289
aVThat seems kind of simple, somehow or another.
p290
aVI mean, virtually everybody over 10 months of age
p291
aVwalks around on two legs, right?
p292
aVSo that maybe is not that interesting.
p293
aVSo instead maybe we want to choose something a little more complicated to look at.
p294
aVHow about the visual system?
p295
aVThere it is, the visual system.
p296
aVI mean, we love our visual systems. We do all kinds of cool stuff.
p297
aVIndeed, there are over 12,000 neuroscientists
p298
aVwho work on the visual system,
p299
aVfrom the retina to the visual cortex,
p300
aVin an attempt to understand not just the visual system
p301
aVbut to also understand how general principles
p302
aVof how the brain might work.
p303
aVBut now here's the thing:
p304
aVOur technology has actually been pretty good
p305
aVat replicating what the visual system does.
p306
aVWe have TV, we have movies,
p307
aVwe have animation, we have photography,
p308
aVwe have pattern recognition, all of these sorts of things.
p309
aVThey work differently than our visual systems in some cases,
p310
aVbut nonetheless we've been pretty good at
p311
aVmaking a technology work like our visual system.
p312
aVSomehow or another, a hundred years of robotics,
p313
aVyou never saw a robot walk on two legs,
p314
aVbecause robots don't walk on two legs
p315
aVbecause it's not such an easy thing to do.
p316
aVA hundred years of robotics,
p317
aVand we can't get a robot that can move more than a couple steps one way or the other.
p318
aVYou ask them to go up an inclined plane, and they fall over.
p319
aVTurn around, and they fall over. It's a serious problem.
p320
aVSo what is it that's the most difficult thing for a brain to do?
p321
aVWhat ought we to be studying?
p322
aVPerhaps it ought to be walking on two legs, or the motor system.
p323
aVI'll give you an example from my own lab,
p324
aVmy own particularly smelly question,
p325
aVsince we work on the sense of smell.
p326
aVBut here's a diagram of five molecules
p327
aVand sort of a chemical notation.
p328
aVThese are just plain old molecules, but if you sniff those molecules
p329
aVup these two little holes in the front of your face,
p330
aVyou will have in your mind the distinct impression of a rose.
p331
aVIf there's a real rose there, those molecules will be the ones,
p332
aVbut even if there's no rose there,
p333
aVyou'll have the memory of a molecule.
p334
aVHow do we turn molecules into perceptions?
p335
aVWhat's the process by which that could happen?
p336
aVHere's another example: two very simple molecules, again in this kind of chemical notation.
p337
aVIt might be easier to visualize them this way,
p338
aVso the gray circles are carbon atoms, the white ones
p339
aVare hydrogen atoms and the red ones are oxygen atoms.
p340
aVNow these two molecules differ by only one carbon atom
p341
aVand two little hydrogen atoms that ride along with it,
p342
aVand yet one of them, heptyl acetate,
p343
aVhas the distinct odor of a pear,
p344
aVand hexyl acetate is unmistakably banana.
p345
aVSo there are two really interesting questions here, it seems to me.
p346
aVOne is, how can a simple little molecule like that
p347
aVcreate a perception in your brain that's so clear
p348
aVas a pear or a banana?
p349
aVAnd secondly, how the hell can we tell the difference
p350
aVbetween two molecules that differ by a single carbon atom?
p351
aVI mean, that's remarkable to me,
p352
aVclearly the best chemical detector on the face of the planet.
p353
aVAnd you don't even think about it, do you?
p354
aa(lp355
VSo this is a favorite quote of mine that takes us
p356
aVback to the ignorance and the idea of questions.
p357
aVI like to quote because I think dead people
p358
aVshouldn't be excluded from the conversation.
p359
aVAnd I also think it's important to realize that
p360
aVthe conversation's been going on for a while, by the way.
p361
aVSo Erwin Schrodinger, a great quantum physicist
p362
aVand, I think, philosopher, points out how you have to
p363
aV"abide by ignorance for an indefinite period" of time.
p364
aVAnd it's this abiding by ignorance
p365
aVthat I think we have to learn how to do.
p366
aVThis is a tricky thing. This is not such an easy business.
p367
aa(lp368
VI guess it comes down to our education system,
p369
aVso I'm going to talk a little bit about ignorance and education,
p370
aVbecause I think that's where it really has to play out.
p371
aVSo for one, let's face it,
p372
aVin the age of Google and Wikipedia,
p373
aVthe business model of the university
p374
aVand probably secondary schools is simply going to have to change.
p375
aVWe just can't sell facts for a living anymore.
p376
aVThey're available with a click of the mouse,
p377
aVor if you want to, you could probably just ask the wall
p378
aVone of these days, wherever they're going to hide the things
p379
aVthat tell us all this stuff.
p380
aa(lp381
VSo what do we have to do? We have to give our students
p382
aVa taste for the boundaries, for what's outside that circumference,
p383
aVfor what's outside the facts, what's just beyond the facts.
p384
aa(lp385
VHow do we do that?
p386
aVWell, one of the problems, of course,
p387
aVturns out to be testing.
p388
aVWe currently have an educational system
p389
aVwhich is very efficient but is very efficient at a rather bad thing.
p390
aVSo in second grade, all the kids are interested in science,
p391
aVthe girls and the boys.
p392
aVThey like to take stuff apart. They have great curiosity.
p393
aVThey like to investigate things. They go to science museums.
p394
aVThey like to play around. They're in second grade.
p395
aVThey're interested.
p396
aVBut by 11th or 12th grade, fewer than 10 percent
p397
aVof them have any interest in science whatsoever,
p398
aVlet alone a desire to go into science as a career.
p399
aVSo we have this remarkably efficient system
p400
aVfor beating any interest in science out of everybody's head.
p401
aa(lp402
VIs this what we want?
p403
aVI think this comes from what a teacher colleague of mine
p404
aVcalls "the bulimic method of education."
p405
aVYou know. You can imagine what it is.
p406
aVWe just jam a whole bunch of facts down their throats over here
p407
aVand then they puke it up on an exam over here
p408
aVand everybody goes home with no added intellectual heft whatsoever.
p409
aa(lp410
VThis can't possibly continue to go on.
p411
aVSo what do we do? Well the geneticists, I have to say,
p412
aVhave an interesting maxim they live by.
p413
aVGeneticists always say, you always get what you screen for.
p414
aVAnd that's meant as a warning.
p415
aVSo we always will get what we screen for,
p416
aVand part of what we screen for is in our testing methods.
p417
aVWell, we hear a lot about testing and evaluation,
p418
aVand we have to think carefully when we're testing
p419
aVwhether we're evaluating or whether we're weeding,
p420
aVwhether we're weeding people out,
p421
aVwhether we're making some cut.
p422
aVEvaluation is one thing. You hear a lot about evaluation
p423
aVin the literature these days, in the educational literature,

aVbut evaluation really amounts to feedback and it amounts
p425
aVto an opportunity for trial and error.
p426
aVIt amounts to a chance to work over a longer period of time
p427
aVwith this kind of feedback.
p428
aVThat's different than weeding, and usually, I have to tell you,
p429
aVwhen people talk about evaluation, evaluating students,
p430
aVevaluating teachers, evaluating schools,
p431
aVevaluating programs, that they're really talking about weeding.
p432
aVAnd that's a bad thing, because then you will get what you select for,
p433
aVwhich is what we've gotten so far.
p434
aa(lp435
VSo I'd say what we need is a test that says, "What is x?"
p436
aVand the answers are "I don't know, because no one does,"
p437
aVor "What's the question?" Even better.
p438
aVOr, "You know what, I'll look it up, I'll ask someone,
p439
aVI'll phone someone. I'll find out."
p440
aVBecause that's what we want people to do,
p441
aVand that's how you evaluate them.
p442
aVAnd maybe for the advanced placement classes,
p443
aVit could be, "Here's the answer. What's the next question?"
p444
aVThat's the one I like in particular.
p445
aa(lp446
VSo let me end with a quote from William Butler Yeats,
p447
aVwho said "Education is not about filling buckets;
p448
aVit is lighting fires."
p449
aa(lp450
VSo I'd say, let's get out the matches.
p451
