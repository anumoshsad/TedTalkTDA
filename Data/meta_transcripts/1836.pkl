VHere's a question we need to rethink together:
p4
aVWhat should be the role of money
p5
aVand markets in our societies?
p6
aa(lp7
VToday, there are very few things
p8
aVthat money can't buy.
p9
aVIf you're sentenced to a jail term
p10
aVin Santa Barbara, California,
p11
aVyou should know
p12
aVthat if you don't like the standard accommodations,
p13
aVyou can buy a prison cell upgrade.
p14
aVIt's true. For how much, do you think?
p15
aVWhat would you guess?
p16
aVFive hundred dollars?
p17
aVIt's not the Ritz-Carlton. It's a jail!
p18
aVEighty-two dollars a night.
p19
aVEighty-two dollars a night.
p20
aVIf you go to an amusement park
p21
aVand don't want to stand in the long lines
p22
aVfor the popular rides,
p23
aVthere is now a solution.
p24
aVIn many theme parks, you can pay extra
p25
aVto jump to the head of the line.
p26
aVThey call them Fast Track or VIP tickets.
p27
aa(lp28
VAnd this isn't only happening in amusement parks.
p29
aVIn Washington, D.C., long lines,
p30
aVqueues sometimes form
p31
aVfor important Congressional hearings.
p32
aVNow some people don't like to wait in long queues,
p33
aVmaybe overnight, even in the rain.
p34
aVSo now, for lobbyists and others
p35
aVwho are very keen to attend these hearings
p36
aVbut don't like to wait, there are companies,
p37
aVline-standing companies,
p38
aVand you can go to them.
p39
aVYou can pay them a certain amount of money,
p40
aVthey hire homeless people and others who need a job
p41
aVto stand waiting in the line for as long as it takes,
p42
aVand the lobbyist, just before the hearing begins,
p43
aVcan take his or her place at the head of the line
p44
aVand a seat in the front of the room.
p45
aVPaid line standing.
p46
aa(lp47
VIt's happening, the recourse to market mechanisms
p48
aVand market thinking and market solutions,
p49
aVin bigger arenas.
p50
aVTake the way we fight our wars.
p51
aVDid you know that, in Iraq and Afghanistan,
p52
aVthere were more private military contractors on the ground
p53
aVthan there were U.S. military troops?
p54
aVNow this isn't because we had a public debate
p55
aVabout whether we wanted to outsource war
p56
aVto private companies,
p57
aVbut this is what has happened.
p58
aa(lp59
VOver the past three decades,
p60
aVwe have lived through a quiet revolution.
p61
aVWe've drifted almost without realizing it
p62
aVfrom having a market economy
p63
aVto becoming market societies.
p64
aVThe difference is this: A market economy is a tool,
p65
aVa valuable and effective tool,
p66
aVfor organizing productive activity,
p67
aVbut a market society is a place where
p68
aValmost everything is up for sale.
p69
aVIt's a way of life, in which market thinking
p70
aVand market values begin to dominate
p71
aVevery aspect of life:
p72
aVpersonal relations, family life, health, education,
p73
aVpolitics, law, civic life.
p74
aa(lp75
VNow, why worry? Why worry about our becoming
p76
aVmarket societies?
p77
aVFor two reasons, I think.
p78
aVOne of them has to do with inequality.
p79
aVThe more things money can buy,
p80
aVthe more affluence, or the lack of it, matters.
p81
aVIf the only thing that money determined
p82
aVwas access to yachts or fancy vacations or BMWs,
p83
aVthen inequality wouldn't matter very much.
p84
aVBut when money comes increasingly to govern
p85
aVaccess to the essentials of the good life \u2014
p86
aVdecent health care, access to the best education,
p87
aVpolitical voice and influence in campaigns \u2014
p88
aVwhen money comes to govern all of those things,
p89
aVinequality matters a great deal.
p90
aVAnd so the marketization of everything
p91
aVsharpens the sting of inequality
p92
aVand its social and civic consequence.
p93
aVThat's one reason to worry.
p94
aa(lp95
VThere's a second reason
p96
aVapart from the worry about inequality,
p97
aVand it's this:
p98
aVwith some social goods and practices,
p99
aVwhen market thinking and market values enter,
p100
aVthey may change the meaning of those practices
p101
aVand crowd out attitudes and norms
p102
aVworth caring about.
p103
aa(lp104
VI'd like to take an example
p105
aVof a controversial use of a market mechanism,
p106
aVa cash incentive, and see what you think about it.
p107
aVMany schools struggle with the challenge
p108
aVof motivating kids, especially kids
p109
aVfrom disadvantaged backgrounds, to study hard,
p110
aVto do well in school, to apply themselves.
p111
aVSome economists have proposed a market solution:
p112
aVOffer cash incentives to kids for getting good grades
p113
aVor high test scores
p114
aVor for reading books.
p115
aVThey've tried this, actually.
p116
aVThey've done some experiments
p117
aVin some major American cities.
p118
aVIn New York, in Chicago, in Washington, D.C.,
p119
aVthey've tried this, offering 50 dollars for an A,
p120
aV35 dollars for a B.
p121
aVIn Dallas, Texas, they have a program that offers
p122
aVeight-year-olds two dollars for each book they read.
p123
aa(lp124
VSo let's see what \u2014 Some people are in favor,
p125
aVsome people are opposed to this cash incentive
p126
aVto motivate achievement.
p127
aVLet's see what people here think about it.
p128
aVImagine that you are the head of a major school system,
p129
aVand someone comes to you with this proposal.
p130
aVAnd let's say it's a foundation. They will provide the funds.
p131
aVYou don't have to take it out of your budget.
p132
aVHow many would be in favor
p133
aVand how many would be opposed to giving it a try?
p134
aVLet's see by a show of hands.
p135
aa(lp136
VFirst, how many think it might at least be worth a try
p137
aVto see if it would work? Raise your hand.
p138
aa(lp139
VAnd how many would be opposed? How many would \u2014
p140
aa(lp141
VSo the majority here are opposed,
p142
aVbut a sizable minority are in favor.
p143
aVLet's have a discussion.
p144
aVLet's start with those of you who object,
p145
aVwho would rule it out even before trying.
p146
aVWhat would be your reason?
p147
aVWho will get our discussion started? Yes?
p148
aa(lp149
VHeike Moses: Hello everyone, I'm Heike,
p150
aVand I think it just kills the intrinsic motivation,
p151
aVso in the respect that children, if they would like to read,
p152
aVyou just take this incentive away
p153
aVin just paying them, so it just changes behavior.
p154
aVMichael Sandel: Takes the intrinsic incentive away.
p155
aa(lp156
VWhat is, or should be, the intrinsic motivation?
p157
aa(lp158
VHM: Well, the intrinsic motivation
p159
aVshould be to learn.
p160
aa(lp161
VMS: To learn. HM: To get to know the world.
p162
aVAnd then, if you stop paying them, what happens then?
p163
aVThen they stop reading?
p164
aa(lp165
VMS: Now, let's see if there's someone who favors,
p166
aVwho thinks it's worth trying this.
p167
aa(lp168
VElizabeth Loftus: I'm Elizabeth Loftus,
p169
aVand you said worth a try, so why not try it
p170
aVand do the experiment and measure things?
p171
aVMS: And measure. And what would you measure?
p172
aVYou'd measure how many \u2014
p173
aVEL: How many books they read
p174
aVand how many books they continued to read
p175
aVafter you stopped paying them.
p176
aa(lp177
VMS: Oh, after you stopped paying.
p178
aVAll right, what about that?
p179
aa(lp180
VHM: To be frank, I just think
p181
aVthis is, not to offend anyone, a very American way.
p182
aa(lp183
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p184
aa(lp185
VMS: All right. What's emerged from this discussion
p186
aVis the following question:
p187
aVWill the cash incentive drive out or corrupt
p188
aVor crowd out the higher motivation,
p189
aVthe intrinsic lesson that we hope to convey,
p190
aVwhich is to learn to love to learn and to read
p191
aVfor their own sakes?
p192
aVAnd people disagree about what the effect will be,
p193
aVbut that seems to be the question,
p194
aVthat somehow a market mechanism
p195
aVor a cash incentive teaches the wrong lesson,
p196
aVand if it does, what will become of these children later?
p197
aa(lp198
VI should tell you what's happened with these experiments.
p199
aVThe cash for good grades has had very mixed results,
p200
aVfor the most part has not resulted in higher grades.
p201
aVThe two dollars for each book
p202
aVdid lead those kids to read more books.
p203
aVIt also led them to read shorter books.
p204
aa(lp205
V(Laughter)
p206
aa(lp207
VBut the real question is,
p208
aVwhat will become of these kids later?
p209
aVWill they have learned that reading is a chore,
p210
aVa form of piecework to be done for pay, that's the worry,
p211
aVor may it lead them to read maybe for the wrong reason initially
p212
aVbut then lead them to fall in love with reading for its own sake?
p213
aa(lp214
VNow, what this, even this brief debate, brings out
p215
aVis something that many economists overlook.
p216
aVEconomists often assume
p217
aVthat markets are inert,
p218
aVthat they do not touch or taint the goods they exchange.
p219
aVMarket exchange, they assume,
p220
aVdoesn't change the meaning or value
p221
aVof the goods being exchanged.
p222
aVThis may be true enough
p223
aVif we're talking about material goods.
p224
aVIf you sell me a flat screen television
p225
aVor give me one as a gift,
p226
aVit will be the same good.
p227
aVIt will work the same either way.
p228
aVBut the same may not be true
p229
aVif we're talking about nonmaterial goods
p230
aVand social practices such as teaching and learning
p231
aVor engaging together in civic life.
p232
aVIn those domains, bringing market mechanisms
p233
aVand cash incentives may undermine
p234
aVor crowd out nonmarket values and attitudes
p235
aVworth caring about.
p236
aVOnce we see
p237
aVthat markets and commerce,
p238
aVwhen extended beyond the material domain,
p239
aVcan change the character of the goods themselves,
p240
aVcan change the meaning of the social practices,
p241
aVas in the example of teaching and learning,
p242
aVwe have to ask where markets belong
p243
aVand where they don't,
p244
aVwhere they may actually undermine
p245
aVvalues and attitudes worth caring about.
p246
aVBut to have this debate,
p247
aVwe have to do something we're not very good at,
p248
aVand that is to reason together in public
p249
aVabout the value and the meaning
p250
aVof the social practices we prize,
p251
aVfrom our bodies to family life
p252
aVto personal relations to health
p253
aVto teaching and learning to civic life.
p254
aa(lp255
VNow these are controversial questions,
p256
aVand so we tend to shrink from them.
p257
aVIn fact, during the past three decades,
p258
aVwhen market reasoning and market thinking
p259
aVhave gathered force and gained prestige,
p260
aVour public discourse during this time
p261
aVhas become hollowed out,
p262
aVempty of larger moral meaning.
p263
aVFor fear of disagreement, we shrink from these questions.
p264
aVBut once we see that markets
p265
aVchange the character of goods,
p266
aVwe have to debate among ourselves
p267
aVthese bigger questions
p268
aVabout how to value goods.
p269
aa(lp270
VOne of the most corrosive effects
p271
aVof putting a price on everything
p272
aVis on commonality,
p273
aVthe sense that we are all in it together.
p274
aVAgainst the background of rising inequality,
p275
aVmarketizing every aspect of life
p276
aVleads to a condition where those who are affluent
p277
aVand those who are of modest means
p278
aVincreasingly live separate lives.
p279
aVWe live and work and shop and play
p280
aVin different places.
p281
aVOur children go to different schools.
p282
aa(lp283
VThis isn't good for democracy,
p284
aVnor is it a satisfying way to live,
p285
aVeven for those of us who can afford
p286
aVto buy our way to the head of the line.
p287
aVHere's why.
p288
aVDemocracy does not require perfect equality,
p289
aVbut what it does require
p290
aVis that citizens share in a common life.
p291
aVWhat matters is that people
p292
aVof different social backgrounds
p293
aVand different walks of life
p294
aVencounter one another,
p295
aVbump up against one another
p296
aVin the ordinary course of life,
p297
aVbecause this is what teaches us
p298
aVto negotiate and to abide our differences.
p299
aVAnd this is how we come to care for the common good.
p300
aa(lp301
VAnd so, in the end, the question of markets
p302
aVis not mainly an economic question.
p303
aVIt's really a question of how we want to live together.
p304
aVDo we want a society where everything is up for sale,
p305
aVor are there certain moral and civic goods
p306
aVthat markets do not honor
p307
aVand money cannot buy?
p308
