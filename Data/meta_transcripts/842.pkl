VSalaam. Namaskar.
p4
aVGood morning.
p5
aVGiven my TED profile, you might be expecting
p6
aVthat I'm going to speak to you about
p7
aVthe latest philanthropic trends \u2014
p8
aVthe one that's currently got Wall Street
p9
aVand the World Bank buzzing \u2014
p10
aVhow to invest in women,
p11
aVhow to empower them, how to save them.
p12
aa(lp13
VNot me.
p14
aVI am interested in how women
p15
aVare saving us.
p16
aVThey're saving us by redefining and re-imagining
p17
aVa future that defies and blurs
p18
aVaccepted polarities,
p19
aVpolarities we've taken for granted for a long time,
p20
aVlike the ones between modernity and tradition,
p21
aVFirst World and Third World,
p22
aVoppression and opportunity.
p23
aVIn the midst of the daunting challenges
p24
aVwe face as a global community,
p25
aVthere's something about
p26
aVthis third way raga
p27
aVthat is making my heart sing.
p28
aVWhat intrigues me most
p29
aVis how women are doing this,
p30
aVdespite a set of paradoxes
p31
aVthat are both frustrating and fascinating.
p32
aa(lp33
VWhy is it that women are, on the one hand,
p34
aVviciously oppressed by cultural practices,
p35
aVand yet at the same time,
p36
aVare the preservers of cultures in most societies?
p37
aVIs the hijab or the headscarf
p38
aVa symbol of submission
p39
aVor resistance?
p40
aVWhen so many women and girls
p41
aVare beaten, raped, maimed
p42
aVon a daily basis
p43
aVin the name of all kinds of causes \u2014
p44
aVhonor, religion, nationality \u2014
p45
aVwhat allows women to replant trees,
p46
aVto rebuild societies,
p47
aVto lead radical, non-violent movements
p48
aVfor social change?
p49
aVIs it different women
p50
aVwho are doing the preserving and the radicalizing?
p51
aVOr are they one and the same?
p52
aVAre we guilty, as Chimamanda Adichie reminded us
p53
aVat the TED conference in Oxford,
p54
aVof assuming that there is a single story
p55
aVof women's struggles for their rights
p56
aVwhile there are, in fact, many?
p57
aVAnd what, if anything,
p58
aVdo men have to do with it?
p59
aa(lp60
VMuch of my life has been a quest
p61
aVto get some answers to these questions.
p62
aVIt's taken me across the globe
p63
aVand introduced me to some amazing people.
p64
aVIn the process, I've gathered a few fragments
p65
aVthat help me shed some light on this puzzle.
p66
aVAmong those who've helped open my eyes
p67
aVto a third way
p68
aVare: a devout Muslim in Afghanistan,
p69
aVa group of harmonizing lesbians in Croatia
p70
aVand a taboo breaker in Liberia.
p71
aVI'm indebted to them,
p72
aVas I am to my parents,
p73
aVwho for some set of misdemeanors in their last life,
p74
aVwere blessed with three daughters in this one.
p75
aVAnd for reasons equally unclear to me,
p76
aVseem to be inordinately proud of the three of us.
p77
aa(lp78
VI was born and raised here in India,
p79
aVand I learned from an early age
p80
aVto be deeply suspicious of the aunties and uncles
p81
aVwho would bend down, pat us on the head
p82
aVand then say to my parents
p83
aVwith no problem at all,
p84
aV"Poor things. You only have three daughters.
p85
aVBut you're young, you could still try again."
p86
aVMy sense of outrage
p87
aVabout women's rights
p88
aVwas brought to a boil when I was about 11.
p89
aVMy aunt, an incredibly articulate
p90
aVand brilliant woman,
p91
aVwas widowed early.
p92
aVA flock of relatives descended on her.
p93
aVThey took off her colorful sari.
p94
aVThey made her wear a white one.
p95
aVThey wiped her bindi off her forehead.
p96
aVThey broke her bangles.
p97
aVHer daughter, Rani,
p98
aVa few years older than me,
p99
aVsat in her lap bewildered,
p100
aVnot knowing what had happened
p101
aVto the confident woman
p102
aVshe once knew as her mother.
p103
aVLate that night, I heard my mother
p104
aVbegging my father,
p105
aV"Please do something Ramu. Can't you intervene?"
p106
aVAnd my father, in a low voice, muttering,
p107
aV"I'm just the youngest brother, there's nothing I can do.
p108
aVThis is tradition."
p109
aVThat's the night I learned the rules
p110
aVabout what it means to be female in this world.
p111
aVWomen don't make those rules,
p112
aVbut they define us, and they define
p113
aVour opportunities and our chances.
p114
aVAnd men are affected by those rules too.
p115
aVMy father, who had fought in three wars,
p116
aVcould not save his own sister
p117
aVfrom this suffering.
p118
aa(lp119
VBy 18,
p120
aVunder the excellent tutelage of my mother,
p121
aVI was therefore, as you might expect,
p122
aVdefiantly feminist.
p123
aVOn the streets chanting,
p124
aV"[Hindi]
p125
aV[Hindi]
p126
aVWe are the women of India.
p127
aVWe are not flowers, we are sparks of change."
p128
aVBy the time I got to Beijing in 1995,
p129
aVit was clear to me, the only way
p130
aVto achieve gender equality
p131
aVwas to overturn centuries
p132
aVof oppressive tradition.
p133
aVSoon after I returned from Beijing,
p134
aVI leapt at the chance to work for this wonderful organization,
p135
aVfounded by women,
p136
aVto support women's rights organizations around the globe.
p137
aVBut barely six months into my new job,
p138
aVI met a woman
p139
aVwho forced me to challenge all my assumptions.
p140
aVHer name is Sakena Yacoobi.
p141
aa(lp142
VShe walked into my office
p143
aVat a time when no one knew
p144
aVwhere Afghanistan was in the United States.
p145
aVShe said to me, "It is not about the burka."
p146
aVShe was the most determined advocate
p147
aVfor women's rights I had ever heard.
p148
aVShe told me women were running underground schools
p149
aVin her communities inside Afghanistan,
p150
aVand that her organization, the Afghan Institute of Learning,
p151
aVhad started a school in Pakistan.
p152
aVShe said, "The first thing anyone who is a Muslim knows
p153
aVis that the Koran requires
p154
aVand strongly supports literacy.
p155
aVThe prophet wanted every believer
p156
aVto be able to read the Koran for themselves."
p157
aVHad I heard right?
p158
aVWas a women's rights advocate
p159
aVinvoking religion?
p160
aVBut Sakena defies labels.
p161
aVShe always wears a headscarf,
p162
aVbut I've walked alongside with her on a beach
p163
aVwith her long hair flying in the breeze.
p164
aVShe starts every lecture with a prayer,
p165
aVbut she's a single, feisty,
p166
aVfinancially independent woman
p167
aVin a country where girls are married off at the age of 12.
p168
aa(lp169
VShe is also immensely pragmatic.
p170
aV"This headscarf and these clothes," she says,
p171
aV"give me the freedom to do what I need to do
p172
aVto speak to those whose support and assistance
p173
aVare critical for this work.
p174
aVWhen I had to open the school in the refugee camp,
p175
aVI went to see the imam.
p176
aVI told him, 'I'm a believer, and women and children
p177
aVin these terrible conditions
p178
aVneed their faith to survive.'"
p179
aVShe smiles slyly.
p180
aV"He was flattered.
p181
aVHe began to come twice a week to my center
p182
aVbecause women could not go to the mosque.
p183
aVAnd after he would leave,
p184
aVwomen and girls would stay behind.
p185
aVWe began with a small literacy class
p186
aVto read the Koran,
p187
aVthen a math class, then an English class, then computer classes.
p188
aVIn a few weeks, everyone in the refugee camp
p189
aVwas in our classes."
p190
aVSakena is a teacher
p191
aVat a time when to educate women
p192
aVis a dangerous business in Afghanistan.
p193
aa(lp194
VShe is on the Taliban's hit list.
p195
aVI worry about her every time she travels across that country.
p196
aVShe shrugs when I ask her about safety.
p197
aV"Kavita jaan, we cannot allow ourselves to be afraid.
p198
aVLook at those young girls who go back to school
p199
aVwhen acid is thrown in their face."
p200
aVAnd I smile, and I nod,
p201
aVrealizing I'm watching women and girls
p202
aVusing their own religious traditions and practices,
p203
aVturning them into instruments
p204
aVof opposition and opportunity.
p205
aVTheir path is their own
p206
aVand it looks towards an Afghanistan
p207
aVthat will be different.
p208
aa(lp209
VBeing different is something the women
p210
aVof Lesbor in Zagreb, Croatia
p211
aVknow all too well.
p212
aVTo be a lesbian, a dyke,
p213
aVa homosexual
p214
aVin most parts of the world, including right here
p215
aVin our country, India,
p216
aVis to occupy a place of immense discomfort
p217
aVand extreme prejudice.
p218
aVIn post-conflict societies like Croatia,
p219
aVwhere a hyper-nationalism and religiosity
p220
aVhave created an environment unbearable
p221
aVfor anyone who might
p222
aVbe considered a social outcast.
p223
aVSo enter a group of out dykes,
p224
aVyoung women who love the old music
p225
aVthat once spread across that region
p226
aVfrom Macedonia to Bosnia,
p227
aVfrom Serbia to Slovenia.
p228
aVThese folk singers met at college at a gender studies program.
p229
aVMany are in their 20s, some are mothers.
p230
aVMany have struggled to come out to their communities,
p231
aVin families whose religious beliefs make it hard to accept
p232
aVthat their daughters are not sick,
p233
aVjust queer.
p234
aVAs Leah, one of the founders of the group, says,
p235
aV"I like traditional music very much.
p236
aVI also like rock and roll.
p237
aVSo Lesbor, we blend the two.
p238
aVI see traditional music like a kind of rebellion,
p239
aVin which people can really speak their voice,
p240
aVespecially traditional songs
p241
aVfrom other parts of the former Yugoslav Republic.
p242
aVAfter the war, lots of these songs were lost,
p243
aVbut they are a part of our childhood and our history,
p244
aVand we should not forget them."
p245
aa(lp246
VImprobably, this LGBT singing choir
p247
aVhas demonstrated how women
p248
aVare investing in tradition to create change,
p249
aVlike alchemists turning discord into harmony.
p250
aVTheir repertoire includes
p251
aVthe Croatian national anthem,
p252
aVa Bosnian love song
p253
aVand Serbian duets.
p254
aVAnd, Leah adds with a grin,
p255
aV"Kavita, we especially are proud of our Christmas music,
p256
aVbecause it shows we are open to religious practices
p257
aVeven though Catholic Church
p258
aVhates us LGBT."
p259
aVTheir concerts draw from
p260
aVtheir own communities, yes,
p261
aVbut also from an older generation:
p262
aVa generation that might be
p263
aVsuspicious of homosexuality,
p264
aVbut is nostalgic for its own music and the past it represents.
p265
aVOne father, who had initially balked at his daughter
p266
aVcoming out in such a choir,
p267
aVnow writes songs for them.
p268
aVIn the Middle Ages, troubadours
p269
aVwould travel across the land
p270
aVsinging their tales and sharing their verses:
p271
aVLesbor travels through the Balkans like this,
p272
aVsinging, connecting people divided
p273
aVby religion, nationality and language.
p274
aVBosnians, Croats and Serbs
p275
aVfind a rare shared space of pride in their history,
p276
aVand Lesbor reminds them that
p277
aVthe songs one group often claims as theirs alone
p278
aVreally belong to them all.
p279
aa(lp280
V(Singing)
p281
aa(lp282
VYesterday, Mallika Sarabhai showed us
p283
aVthat music can create a world
p284
aVmore accepting of difference
p285
aVthan the one we have been given.
p286
aVThe world Leymah Gbowee was given
p287
aVwas a world at war.
p288
aVLiberia had been torn apart by civil strife for decades.
p289
aVLeymah was not an activist, she was a mother of three.
p290
aVBut she was sick with worry:
p291
aVShe worried her son would be abducted
p292
aVand taken off to be a child soldier,
p293
aVshe worried her daughters would be raped,
p294
aVshe worried for their lives.
p295
aVOne night, she had a dream.
p296
aVShe dreamt she and thousands of other women
p297
aVended the bloodshed.
p298
aVThe next morning at church, she asked others how they felt.
p299
aVThey were all tired of the fighting.
p300
aVWe need peace, and we need our leaders to know
p301
aVwe will not rest until there is peace.
p302
aVAmong Leymah's friends was a policewoman who was Muslim.
p303
aVShe promised to raise the issue with her community.
p304
aa(lp305
VAt the next Friday sermon,
p306
aVthe women who were sitting in the side room of the mosque
p307
aVbegan to share their distress at the state of affairs.
p308
aV"What does it matter?" they said, "A bullet doesn't distinguish
p309
aVbetween a Muslim and a Christian."
p310
aVThis small group of women,
p311
aVdetermined to bring an end to the war,
p312
aVand they chose to use their traditions to make a point:
p313
aVLiberian women usually wear
p314
aVlots of jewelry and colorful clothing.
p315
aVBut no, for the protest, they dressed
p316
aVall in white, no makeup.
p317
aVAs Leymah said, "We wore the white
p318
aVsaying we were out for peace."
p319
aVThey stood on the side of the road on which
p320
aVCharles Taylor's motorcade passed every day.
p321
aVThey stood for weeks \u2014
p322
aVfirst just 10, then 20, then 50, then hundreds of women \u2014
p323
aVwearing white, singing, dancing,
p324
aVsaying they were out for peace.
p325
aa(lp326
VEventually, opposing forces in Liberia
p327
aVwere pushed to hold peace talks in Ghana.
p328
aVThe peace talks dragged on and on and on.
p329
aVLeymah and her sisters had had enough.
p330
aVWith their remaining funds, they took
p331
aVa small group of women down to the venue of the peace talks
p332
aVand they surrounded the building.
p333
aVIn a now famous CNN clip,
p334
aVyou can see them sitting on the ground, their arms linked.
p335
aVWe know this in India. It's called a [Hindi].
p336
aVThen things get tense.
p337
aVThe police are called in to physically remove the women.
p338
aVAs the senior officer approaches with a baton,
p339
aVLeymah stands up with deliberation,
p340
aVreaches her arms up over her head,
p341
aVand begins, very slowly,
p342
aVto untie her headdress that covers her hair.
p343
aVYou can see the policeman's face.
p344
aVHe looks embarrassed. He backs away.
p345
aVAnd the next thing you know,
p346
aVthe police have disappeared.
p347
aVLeymah said to me later,
p348
aV"It's a taboo, you know, in West Africa.
p349
aVIf an older woman undresses in front of a man
p350
aVbecause she wants to,
p351
aVthe man's family is cursed."
p352
aV(Laughter)
p353
aV(Applause)
p354
aVShe said, "I don't know if he did it because he believed,
p355
aVbut he knew we were not going to leave.
p356
aVWe were not going to leave until the peace accord was signed."
p357
aa(lp358
VAnd the peace accord was signed.
p359
aVAnd the women of Liberia
p360
aVthen mobilized in support of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf,
p361
aVa woman who broke a few taboos herself
p362
aVbecoming the first elected woman head of state
p363
aVin Africa in years.
p364
aVWhen she made her presidential address,
p365
aVshe acknowledged these brave women of Liberia
p366
aVwho allowed her to win against a football star \u2014
p367
aVthat's soccer for you Americans \u2014
p368
aVno less.
p369
aa(lp370
VWomen like Sakena and Leah
p371
aVand Leymah
p372
aVhave humbled me and changed me
p373
aVand made me realize that I should not be so quick
p374
aVto jump to assumptions of any kind.
p375
aVThey've also saved me from my righteous anger
p376
aVby offering insights into this third way.
p377
aVA Filipina activist once said to me,
p378
aV"How do you cook a rice cake?
p379
aVWith heat from the bottom and heat from the top."
p380
aVThe protests, the marches,
p381
aVthe uncompromising position that
p382
aVwomen's rights are human rights, full stop.
p383
aVThat's the heat from the bottom.
p384
aVThat's Malcolm X and the suffragists
p385
aVand gay pride parades.
p386
aVBut we also need the heat from the top.
p387
aVAnd in most parts of the world,
p388
aVthat top is still
p389
aVcontrolled by men.
p390
aa(lp391
VSo to paraphrase Marx: Women make change,
p392
aVbut not in circumstances of their own choosing.
p393
aVThey have to negotiate.
p394
aVThey have to subvert tradition that once silenced them
p395
aVin order to give voice to new aspirations.
p396
aVAnd they need allies from their communities.
p397
aVAllies like the imam,
p398
aVallies like the father who now writes songs
p399
aVfor a lesbian group in Croatia,
p400
aVallies like the policeman who honored a taboo and backed away,
p401
aVallies like my father,
p402
aVwho couldn't help his sister but has helped three daughters
p403
aVpursue their dreams.
p404
aVMaybe this is because feminism,
p405
aVunlike almost every other social movement,
p406
aVis not a struggle against a distinct oppressor \u2014
p407
aVit's not the ruling class
p408
aVor the occupiers or the colonizers \u2014
p409
aVit's against a deeply held set of beliefs and assumptions
p410
aVthat we women, far too often,
p411
aVhold ourselves.
p412
aa(lp413
VAnd perhaps this is the ultimate gift of feminism,
p414
aVthat the personal is in fact the political.
p415
aVSo that, as Eleanor Roosevelt said once of human rights,
p416
aVthe same is true of gender equality:
p417
aVthat it starts in small places, close to home.
p418
aVOn the streets, yes,
p419
aVbut also in negotiations at the kitchen table
p420
aVand in the marital bed
p421
aVand in relationships between lovers and parents
p422
aVand sisters and friends.
p423
aVAnd then
p424
aVyou realize that by integrating
p425
aVaspects of tradition and community
p426
aVinto their struggles,
p427
aVwomen like Sakena and Leah and Leymah \u2014
p428
aVbut also women like Sonia Gandhi here in India
p429
aVand Michelle Bachelet in Chile
p430
aVand Shirin Ebadi in Iran \u2014
p431
aVare doing something else.
p432
aVThey're challenging the very notion
p433
aVof Western models of development.
p434
aVThey are saying, we don't have to be like you
p435
aVto make change.
p436
aVWe can wear a sari or a hijab
p437
aVor pants or a boubou,
p438
aVand we can be party leaders and presidents
p439
aVand human rights lawyers.
p440
aVWe can use our tradition to navigate change.
p441
aVWe can demilitarize societies
p442
aVand pour resources, instead,
p443
aVinto reservoirs of genuine security.
p444
aa(lp445
VIt is in these little stories,
p446
aVthese individual stories,
p447
aVthat I see a radical epic being written
p448
aVby women around the world.
p449
aVIt is in these threads
p450
aVthat are being woven into a resilient fabric
p451
aVthat will sustain communities,
p452
aVthat I find hope.
p453
aVAnd if my heart is singing,
p454
aVit's because in these little fragments,
p455
aVevery now and again, you catch a glimpse
p456
aVof a whole, of a whole new world.
p457
aVAnd she is definitely on her way.
p458
