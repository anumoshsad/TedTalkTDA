VIt can be a very complicated thing, the ocean.
p4
aVAnd it can be a very complicated thing, what human health is.
p5
aVAnd bringing those two together might seem a very daunting task,
p6
aVbut what I'm going to try to say is that
p7
aVeven in that complexity,
p8
aVthere's some simple themes that I think,
p9
aVif we understand, we can really move forward.
p10
aVAnd those simple themes aren't really
p11
aVthemes about the complex science of what's going on,
p12
aVbut things that we all pretty well know.
p13
aVAnd I'm going to start with this one:
p14
aVIf momma ain't happy, ain't nobody happy.
p15
aVWe know that, right? We've experienced that.
p16
aVAnd if we just take that
p17
aVand we build from there,
p18
aVthen we can go to the next step,
p19
aVwhich is that if the ocean ain't happy,
p20
aVain't nobody happy.
p21
aVThat's the theme of my talk.
p22
aVAnd we're making the ocean pretty unhappy in a lot of different ways.
p23
aa(lp24
VThis is a shot of Cannery Row in 1932.
p25
aVCannery Row, at the time,
p26
aVhad the biggest industrial
p27
aVcanning operation on the west coast.
p28
aVWe piled enormous amounts of pollution
p29
aVinto the air and into the water.
p30
aVRolf Bolin, who was a professor
p31
aVat the Hopkin's Marine Station where I work,
p32
aVwrote in the 1940s that
p33
aV"The fumes from the scum floating on the inlets of the bay
p34
aVwere so bad they turned
p35
aVlead-based paints black."
p36
aVPeople working in these canneries
p37
aVcould barely stay there all day because of the smell,
p38
aVbut you know what they came out saying?
p39
aVThey say, "You know what you smell?
p40
aVYou smell money."
p41
aVThat pollution was money to that community,
p42
aVand those people dealt with the pollution
p43
aVand absorbed it into their skin and into their bodies
p44
aVbecause they needed the money.
p45
aVWe made the ocean unhappy; we made people very unhappy,
p46
aVand we made them unhealthy.
p47
aa(lp48
VThe connection between ocean health and human health
p49
aVis actually based upon another couple simple adages,
p50
aVand I want to call that
p51
aV"pinch a minnow, hurt a whale."
p52
aVThe pyramid of ocean life ...
p53
aVNow, when an ecologist looks at the ocean \u2014 I have to tell you \u2014
p54
aVwe look at the ocean in a very different way,
p55
aVand we see different things than when a regular person looks at the ocean
p56
aVbecause when an ecologist looks at the ocean,
p57
aVwe see all those interconnections.
p58
aVWe see the base of the food chain,
p59
aVthe plankton, the small things,
p60
aVand we see how those animals
p61
aVare food to animals in the middle of the pyramid,
p62
aVand on so up this diagram.
p63
aVAnd that flow, that flow of life,
p64
aVfrom the very base up to the very top,
p65
aVis the flow that ecologists see.
p66
aVAnd that's what we're trying to preserve
p67
aVwhen we say, "Save the ocean. Heal the ocean."
p68
aVIt's that pyramid.
p69
aa(lp70
VNow why does that matter for human health?
p71
aVBecause when we jam things in the bottom
p72
aVof that pyramid that shouldn't be there,
p73
aVsome very frightening things happen.
p74
aVPollutants, some pollutants have been created by us:
p75
aVmolecules like PCBs
p76
aVthat can't be broken down by our bodies.
p77
aVAnd they go in the base of that pyramid,
p78
aVand they drift up; they're passed up that way,
p79
aVon to predators and on to the top predators,
p80
aVand in so doing,
p81
aVthey accumulate.
p82
aa(lp83
VNow, to bring that home, I thought I'd invent a little game.
p84
aVWe don't really have to play it; we can just think about it here.
p85
aVIt's the Styrofoam and chocolate game.
p86
aVImagine that when we got on this boat,
p87
aVwe were all given
p88
aVtwo Styrofoam peanuts.
p89
aVCan't do much with them: Put them in your pocket.
p90
aVSuppose the rules are: every time you offer somebody a drink,
p91
aVyou give them the drink,
p92
aVand you give them your Styrofoam peanuts too.
p93
aVWhat'll happen is that the Styrofoam peanuts
p94
aVwill start moving through our society here,
p95
aVand they will accumulate in
p96
aVthe drunkest, stingiest people.
p97
aV(Laughter)
p98
aVThere's no mechanism in this game
p99
aVfor them to go anywhere but into
p100
aVa bigger and bigger pile
p101
aVof indigestible Styrofoam peanuts.
p102
aVAnd that's exactly what happens with PDBs
p103
aVin this food pyramid:
p104
aVThey accumulate into the top of it.
p105
aa(lp106
VNow suppose, instead of Styrofoam peanuts,
p107
aVwe take these lovely little chocolates that we get
p108
aVand we had those instead.
p109
aVWell, some of us would be eating those chocolates
p110
aVinstead of passing them around,
p111
aVand instead of accumulating,
p112
aVthey will just pass into our group here
p113
aVand not accumulate in any one group
p114
aVbecause they're absorbed by us.
p115
aVAnd that's the difference between a PCB
p116
aVand, say, something natural like an omega-3,
p117
aVsomething we want out of the marine food chain.
p118
aa(lp119
VPCBs accumulate.
p120
aVWe have great examples of that, unfortunately.
p121
aVPCBs accumulate in dolphins
p122
aVin Sarasota Bay, in Texas, in North Carolina.
p123
aVThey get into the food chain.
p124
aVThe dolphins eat the fish
p125
aVthat have PCBs from the plankton,
p126
aVand those PCBs, being fat-soluble,
p127
aVaccumulate in these dolphins.
p128
aVNow, a dolphin,
p129
aVmother dolphin, any dolphin \u2014
p130
aVthere's only one way
p131
aVthat a PCB can get out of a dolphin.
p132
aVAnd what's that?
p133
aVIn mother's milk.
p134
aVHere's a diagram of the PCB load
p135
aVof dolphins in Sarasota Bay.
p136
aVAdult males: a huge load.
p137
aVJuveniles: a huge load.
p138
aVFemales after their first calf is already weaned:
p139
aVa lower load.
p140
aVThose females, they're not trying to.
p141
aVThose females are passing the PCBs
p142
aVin the fat of their own mother's milk
p143
aVinto their offspring,
p144
aVand their offspring don't survive.
p145
aVThe death rate in these dolphins,
p146
aVfor the first calf born of every female dolphin,
p147
aVis 60 to 80 percent.
p148
aVThese mothers pump their first offspring
p149
aVfull of this pollutant,
p150
aVand most of them die.
p151
aVNow, the mother then can go and reproduce,
p152
aVbut what a terrible price to pay
p153
aVfor the accumulation of this pollutant
p154
aVin these animals \u2014
p155
aVthe death of the first-born calf.
p156
aa(lp157
VThere's another top predator in the ocean, it turns out.
p158
aVThat top predator, of course, is us.
p159
aVAnd we also are eating meat
p160
aVthat comes from some of these same places.
p161
aVThis is whale meat
p162
aVthat I photographed in a grocery store in Tokyo \u2014
p163
aVor is it?
p164
aVIn fact, what we did a few years ago
p165
aVwas learn how to smuggle
p166
aVa molecular biology lab into Tokyo
p167
aVand use it to genetically test the DNA
p168
aVout of whale meat samples
p169
aVand identify what they really were.
p170
aVAnd some of those whale meat samples were whale meat.
p171
aVSome of them were illegal whale meat, by the way.
p172
aVThat's another story.
p173
aVBut some of them were not whale meat at all.
p174
aVEven though they were labeled whale meat, they were dolphin meat.
p175
aVSome of them were dolphin liver. Some of them were dolphin blubber.
p176
aVAnd those dolphin parts
p177
aVhad a huge load of PCBs,
p178
aVdioxins and heavy metals.
p179
aVAnd that huge load was passing into the people
p180
aVthat ate this meat.
p181
aVIt turns out that a lot of dolphins
p182
aVare being sold as meat
p183
aVin the whale meat market around the world.
p184
aVThat's a tragedy for those populations,
p185
aVbut it's also a tragedy
p186
aVfor the people eating them
p187
aVbecause they don't know that that's toxic meat.
p188
aa(lp189
VWe had these data a few years ago.
p190
aVI remember sitting at my desk
p191
aVbeing about the only person in the world
p192
aVwho knew that whale meat being sold in these markets
p193
aVwas really dolphin meat, and it was toxic.
p194
aVIt had two-to-three-to-400 times the toxic loads
p195
aVever allowed by the EPA.
p196
aVAnd I remember there sitting at my desk thinking,
p197
aV"Well, I know this. This is a great scientific discovery,"
p198
aVbut it was so awful.
p199
aVAnd for the very first time in my scientific career,
p200
aVI broke scientific protocol,
p201
aVwhich is that you take the data and publish them in scientific journals
p202
aVand then begin to talk about them.
p203
aVWe sent a very polite letter
p204
aVto the Minister of Health in Japan
p205
aVand simply pointed out that
p206
aVthis is an intolerable situation, not for us,
p207
aVbut for the people of Japan
p208
aVbecause mothers who may be breastfeeding,
p209
aVwho may have young children,
p210
aVwould be buying something that they thought was healthy,
p211
aVbut it was really toxic.
p212
aVThat led to a whole series of other campaigns in Japan,
p213
aVand I'm really proud to say that at this point,
p214
aVit's very difficult to buy anything in Japan
p215
aVthat's labeled incorrectly,
p216
aVeven though they're still selling whale meat,
p217
aVwhich I believe they shouldn't.
p218
aVBut at least it's labeled correctly,
p219
aVand you're no longer going to be buying
p220
aVtoxic dolphin meat instead.
p221
aa(lp222
VIt isn't just there that this happens,
p223
aVbut in a natural diet of some communities
p224
aVin the Canadian arctic and in the United States
p225
aVand in the European arctic,
p226
aVa natural diet of seals and whales
p227
aVleads to an accumulation of PCBs
p228
aVthat have gathered up from all parts of the world
p229
aVand ended up in these women.
p230
aVThese women have toxic breast milk.
p231
aVThey cannot feed their offspring, their children,
p232
aVtheir breast milk
p233
aVbecause of the accumulation of these toxins
p234
aVin their food chain,
p235
aVin their part of the world's
p236
aVocean pyramid.
p237
aVThat means their immune systems are compromised.
p238
aVIt means that their children's development
p239
aVcan be compromised.
p240
aVAnd the world's attention on this over the last decade
p241
aVhas reduced the problem
p242
aVfor these women,
p243
aVnot by changing the pyramid,
p244
aVbut by changing what they particularly eat out of it.
p245
aVWe've taken them out of their natural pyramid
p246
aVin order to solve this problem.
p247
aVThat's a good thing for this particular acute problem,
p248
aVbut it does nothing to solve the pyramid problem.
p249
aa(lp250
VThere's other ways of breaking the pyramid.
p251
aVThe pyramid, if we jam things in the bottom,
p252
aVcan get backed up like a sewer line that's clogged.
p253
aVAnd if we jam nutrients, sewage, fertilizer
p254
aVin the base of that food pyramid,
p255
aVit can back up all through it.
p256
aVWe end up with things we've heard about before:
p257
aVred tides, for example,
p258
aVwhich are blooms of toxic algae
p259
aVfloating through the oceans
p260
aVcausing neurological damage.
p261
aVWe can also see blooms of bacteria,
p262
aVblooms of viruses in the ocean.
p263
aVThese are two shots of a red tide coming on shore here
p264
aVand a bacteria
p265
aVin the genus vibrio,
p266
aVwhich includes the genus that has cholera in it.
p267
aVHow many people have seen a "beach closed" sign?
p268
aVWhy does that happen?
p269
aVIt happens because we have jammed so much
p270
aVinto the base of the natural ocean pyramid
p271
aVthat these bacteria clog it up
p272
aVand overfill onto our beaches.
p273
aVOften what jams us up is sewage.
p274
aa(lp275
VNow how many of you have ever gone to a state park or a national park
p276
aVwhere you had a big sign at the front saying,
p277
aV"Closed because human sewage
p278
aVis so far over this park
p279
aVthat you can't use it"?
p280
aVNot very often. We wouldn't tolerate that.
p281
aVWe wouldn't tolerate our parks
p282
aVbeing swamped by human sewage,
p283
aVbut beaches are closed a lot in our country.
p284
aVThey're closed more and more and more all around the world for the same reason,
p285
aVand I believe we shouldn't tolerate that either.
p286
aVIt's not just a question of cleanliness;
p287
aVit's also a question of
p288
aVhow those organisms
p289
aVthen turn into human disease.
p290
aVThese vibrios, these bacteria, can actually infect people.
p291
aVThey can go into your skin and create skin infections.
p292
aa(lp293
VThis is a graph from NOAA's ocean and human health initiative,
p294
aVshowing the rise of the infections
p295
aVby vibrio in people
p296
aVover the last few years.
p297
aVSurfers, for example, know this incredibly.
p298
aVAnd if you can see on some surfing sites,
p299
aVin fact, not only do you see
p300
aVwhat the waves are like or what the weather's like,
p301
aVbut on some surf rider sites,
p302
aVyou see a little flashing poo alert.
p303
aVThat means that the beach might have great waves,
p304
aVbut it's a dangerous place for surfers to be
p305
aVbecause they can carry with them,
p306
aVeven after a great day of surfing,
p307
aVthis legacy of an infection that might take a very long time to solve.
p308
aVSome of these infections are actually carrying
p309
aVantibiotic resistance genes now,
p310
aVand that makes them even more difficult.
p311
aa(lp312
VThese same infections
p313
aVcreate harmful algal blooms.
p314
aVThose blooms are generating other kinds of chemicals.
p315
aVThis is just a simple list of some of the types of poisons
p316
aVthat come out of these harmful algal blooms:
p317
aVshellfish poisoning,fish ciguatera,
p318
aVdiarrheic shellfish poisoning \u2014 you don't want to know about that \u2014
p319
aVneurotoxic shellfish poisoning, paralytic shellfish poisoning.
p320
aVThese are things that are getting into our food chain
p321
aVbecause of these blooms.
p322
aVRita Calwell very famously
p323
aVtraced a very interesting story
p324
aVof cholera into human communities,
p325
aVbrought there, not by
p326
aVa normal human vector,
p327
aVbut by a marine vector, this copepod.
p328
aVCopepods are small crustaceans.
p329
aVThey're a tiny fraction of an inch long,
p330
aVand they can carry on their little legs
p331
aVsome of the cholera bacteria
p332
aVthat then leads to human disease.
p333
aVThat has sparked cholera epidemics
p334
aVin ports along the world
p335
aVand has led to increased concentration
p336
aVon trying to make sure shipping
p337
aVdoesn't move these
p338
aVvectors of cholera around the world.
p339
aa(lp340
VSo what do you do?
p341
aVWe have major problems in disrupted ecosystem flow
p342
aVthat the pyramid may not be working so well,
p343
aVthat the flow from the base up into it
p344
aVis being blocked and clogged.
p345
aVWhat do you do when you have this sort of disrupted flow?
p346
aVWell, there's a bunch of things you could do.
p347
aVYou could call Joe the Plumber, for example.
p348
aVAnd he could come in
p349
aVand fix the flow.
p350
aVBut in fact, if you look around the world,
p351
aVnot only are there hope spots
p352
aVfor where we may be able to fix problems,
p353
aVthere have been places where problems have been fixed,
p354
aVwhere people have come to grips with these issues
p355
aVand begun to turn them around.
p356
aVMonterey is one of those.
p357
aa(lp358
VI started out showing how much
p359
aVwe had distressed the Monterey Bay ecosystem
p360
aVwith pollution and the canning industry
p361
aVand all of the attendant problems.
p362
aVIn 1932, that's the picture.
p363
aVIn 2009, the picture is dramatically different.
p364
aVThe canneries are gone. The pollution has abated.
p365
aVBut there's a greater sense here
p366
aVthat what the individual communities need
p367
aVis working ecosystems.
p368
aVThey need a functioning pyramid from the base all the way to the top.
p369
aVAnd that pyramid
p370
aVin Monterey, right now,
p371
aVbecause of the efforts of a lot of different people,
p372
aVis functioning better than it's ever functioned
p373
aVfor the last 150 years.
p374
aa(lp375
VIt didn't happen accidentally.
p376
aVIt happened because many people put their time and effort
p377
aVand their pioneering spirit into this.
p378
aVOn the left there, Julia Platt,
p379
aVthe mayor of my little hometown in Pacific Grove.
p380
aVAt 74 years old, became mayor
p381
aVbecause something had to be done
p382
aVto protect the ocean.
p383
aVIn 1931, she produced California's first
p384
aVcommunity-based marine protected area,
p385
aVright next to the biggest polluting cannery,
p386
aVbecause Julia knew
p387
aVthat when the canneries eventually were gone,
p388
aVthe ocean needed a place to grow from,
p389
aVthat the ocean needed a place to spark a seed,
p390
aVand she wanted to provide that seed.
p391
aa(lp392
VOther people, like David Packard and Julie Packard,
p393
aVwho were instrumental in producing the Monterey Bay aquarium
p394
aVto lock into people's notion
p395
aVthat the ocean
p396
aVand the health of the ocean ecosystem
p397
aVwere just as important to the economy of this area
p398
aVas eating the ecosystem would be.
p399
aVThat change in thinking has led to a dramatic shift,
p400
aVnot only in the fortunes of Monterey Bay,
p401
aVbut other places around the world.
p402
aa(lp403
VWell, I want to leave you with the thought that
p404
aVwhat we're really trying to do here
p405
aVis protect this ocean pyramid,
p406
aVand that ocean pyramid
p407
aVconnects to our own pyramid of life.
p408
aVIt's an ocean planet,
p409
aVand we think of ourselves as a terrestrial species,
p410
aVbut the pyramid of life in the ocean
p411
aVand our own lives on land
p412
aVare intricately connected.
p413
aVAnd it's only through having the ocean being healthy
p414
aVthat we can remain healthy ourselves.
