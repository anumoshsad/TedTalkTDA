VSo here's the good news about families.
p4
aVThe last 50 years have seen a revolution
p5
aVin what it means to be a family.
p6
aVWe have blended families, adopted families,
p7
aVwe have nuclear families living in separate houses
p8
aVand divorced families living in the same house.
p9
aVBut through it all, the family has grown stronger.
p10
aVEight in 10 say the family they have today
p11
aVis as strong or stronger than the family they grew up in.
p12
aa(lp13
VNow, here's the bad news.
p14
aVNearly everyone is completely overwhelmed
p15
aVby the chaos of family life.
p16
aVEvery parent I know, myself included,
p17
aVfeels like we're constantly playing defense.
p18
aVJust when our kids stop teething, they start having tantrums.
p19
aVJust when they stop needing our help taking a bath,
p20
aVthey need our help dealing with cyberstalking or bullying.
p21
aa(lp22
VAnd here's the worst news of all.
p23
aVOur children sense we're out of control.
p24
aVEllen Galinsky of the Families and Work Institute
p25
aVasked 1,000 children, "If you were granted
p26
aVone wish about your parents, what would it be?"
p27
aVThe parents predicted the kids would say,
p28
aVspending more time with them.
p29
aVThey were wrong. The kids' number one wish?
p30
aVThat their parents be less tired and less stressed.
p31
aa(lp32
VSo how can we change this dynamic?
p33
aVAre there concrete things we can do to reduce stress,
p34
aVdraw our family closer,
p35
aVand generally prepare our children to enter the world?
p36
aa(lp37
VI spent the last few years trying to answer that question,
p38
aVtraveling around, meeting families, talking to scholars,
p39
aVexperts ranging from elite peace negotiators
p40
aVto Warren Buffett's bankers to the Green Berets.
p41
aVI was trying to figure out, what do happy families do right
p42
aVand what can I learn from them to make my family happier?
p43
aa(lp44
VI want to tell you about one family that I met,
p45
aVand why I think they offer clues.
p46
aVAt 7 p.m. on a Sunday in Hidden Springs, Idaho,
p47
aVwhere the six members of the Starr family are sitting down
p48
aVto the highlight of their week: the family meeting.
p49
aVThe Starrs are a regular American family
p50
aVwith their share of regular American family problems.
p51
aVDavid is a software engineer. Eleanor takes care
p52
aVof their four children, ages 10 to 15.
p53
aVOne of those kids tutors math on the far side of town.
p54
aVOne has lacrosse on the near side of town.
p55
aVOne has Asperger syndrome. One has ADHD.
p56
aa(lp57
V"We were living in complete chaos," Eleanor said.
p58
aa(lp59
VWhat the Starrs did next, though, was surprising.
p60
aVInstead of turning to friends or relatives,
p61
aVthey looked to David's workplace.
p62
aVThey turned to a cutting-edge program called agile development
p63
aVthat was just spreading from manufacturers in Japan
p64
aVto startups in Silicon Valley.
p65
aVIn agile, workers are organized into small groups
p66
aVand do things in very short spans of time.
p67
aVSo instead of having executives issue grand proclamations,
p68
aVthe team in effect manages itself.
p69
aVYou have constant feedback. You have daily update sessions.
p70
aVYou have weekly reviews. You're constantly changing.
p71
aVDavid said when they brought this system into their home,
p72
aVthe family meetings in particular increased communication,
p73
aVdecreased stress, and made everybody
p74
aVhappier to be part of the family team.
p75
aVWhen my wife and I adopted these family meetings and other techniques
p76
aVinto the lives of our then-five-year-old twin daughters,
p77
aVit was the biggest single change we made since our daughters were born.
p78
aVAnd these meetings had this effect
p79
aVwhile taking under 20 minutes.
p80
aa(lp81
VSo what is Agile, and why can it help
p82
aVwith something that seems so different, like families?
p83
aVIn 1983, Jeff Sutherland was a technologist
p84
aVat a financial firm in New England.
p85
aVHe was very frustrated with how software got designed.
p86
aVCompanies followed the waterfall method, right,
p87
aVin which executives issued orders that slowly trickled down
p88
aVto programmers below,
p89
aVand no one had ever consulted the programmers.
p90
aVEighty-three percent of projects failed.
p91
aVThey were too bloated or too out of date
p92
aVby the time they were done.
p93
aVSutherland wanted to create a system where
p94
aVideas didn't just percolate down but could percolate up from the bottom
p95
aVand be adjusted in real time.
p96
aVHe read 30 years of Harvard Business Review
p97
aVbefore stumbling upon an article in 1986
p98
aVcalled "The New New Product Development Game."
p99
aVIt said that the pace of business was quickening \u2014
p100
aVand by the way, this was in 1986 \u2014
p101
aVand the most successful companies were flexible.
p102
aVIt highlighted Toyota and Canon
p103
aVand likened their adaptable, tight-knit teams to rugby scrums.
p104
aVAs Sutherland told me, we got to that article,
p105
aVand said, "That's it."
p106
aVIn Sutherland's system, companies don't use
p107
aVlarge, massive projects that take two years.
p108
aVThey do things in small chunks.
p109
aVNothing takes longer than two weeks.
p110
aVSo instead of saying, "You guys go off into that bunker
p111
aVand come back with a cell phone or a social network,"
p112
aVyou say, "You go off and come up with one element,
p113
aVthen bring it back. Let's talk about it. Let's adapt."
p114
aVYou succeed or fail quickly.
p115
aVToday, agile is used in a hundred countries,
p116
aVand it's sweeping into management suites.
p117
aVInevitably, people began taking some of these techniques
p118
aVand applying it to their families.
p119
aVYou had blogs pop up, and some manuals were written.
p120
aVEven the Sutherlands told me that they had
p121
aVan Agile Thanksgiving,
p122
aVwhere you had one group of people working on the food,
p123
aVone setting the table, and one greeting visitors at the door.
p124
aVSutherland said it was the best Thanksgiving ever.
p125
aa(lp126
VSo let's take one problem that families face,
p127
aVcrazy mornings, and talk about how agile can help.
p128
aVA key plank is accountability,
p129
aVso teams use information radiators,
p130
aVthese large boards in which everybody is accountable.
p131
aVSo the Starrs, in adapting this to their home,
p132
aVcreated a morning checklist
p133
aVin which each child is expected to tick off chores.
p134
aVSo on the morning I visited, Eleanor came downstairs,
p135
aVpoured herself a cup of coffee, sat in a reclining chair,
p136
aVand she sat there,
p137
aVkind of amiably talking to each of her children
p138
aVas one after the other they came downstairs,
p139
aVchecked the list, made themselves breakfast,
p140
aVchecked the list again, put the dishes in the dishwasher,
p141
aVrechecked the list, fed the pets or whatever chores they had,
p142
aVchecked the list once more, gathered their belongings,
p143
aVand made their way to the bus.
p144
aVIt was one of the most astonishing family dynamics I have ever seen.
p145
aa(lp146
VAnd when I strenuously objected this would never work in our house,
p147
aa(lp148
Vour kids needed way too much monitoring,
p149
aa(lp150
VEleanor looked at me.
p151
aa(lp152
V"That's what I thought," she said.
p153
aV"I told David, 'keep your work out of my kitchen.'
p154
aVBut I was wrong."
p155
aa(lp156
VSo I turned to David: "So why does it work?"
p157
aa(lp158
VHe said, "You can't underestimate the power of doing this."
p159
aVAnd he made a checkmark.
p160
aVHe said, "In the workplace, adults love it.
p161
aVWith kids, it's heaven."
p162
aa(lp163
VThe week we introduced a morning checklist into our house,
p164
aVit cut parental screaming in half. (Laughter)
p165
aVBut the real change didn't come until we had these family meetings.
p166
aVSo following the agile model, we ask three questions:
p167
aVWhat worked well in our family this week,
p168
aVwhat didn't work well, and what will we agree to work on in the week ahead?
p169
aVEveryone throws out suggestions
p170
aVand then we pick two to focus on.
p171
aVAnd suddenly the most amazing things started coming out of our daughters' mouths.
p172
aVWhat worked well this week?
p173
aVGetting over our fear of riding bikes. Making our beds.
p174
aVWhat didn't work well? Our math sheets,
p175
aVor greeting visitors at the door.
p176
aVLike a lot of parents, our kids are something like Bermuda Triangles.
p177
aVLike, thoughts and ideas go in, but none ever comes out,
p178
aVI mean at least not that are revealing.
p179
aVThis gave us access suddenly to their innermost thoughts.
p180
aVBut the most surprising part was when we turned to,
p181
aVwhat are we going to work on in the week ahead?
p182
aVYou know, the key idea of agile is that
p183
aVteams essentially manage themselves,
p184
aVand it works in software and it turns out that it works with kids.
p185
aVOur kids love this process.
p186
aVSo they would come up with all these ideas.
p187
aVYou know, greet five visitors at the door this week,
p188
aVget an extra 10 minutes of reading before bed.
p189
aVKick someone, lose desserts for a month.
p190
aVIt turns out, by the way, our girls are little Stalins.
p191
aVWe constantly have to kind of dial them back.
p192
aVNow look, naturally there's a gap between
p193
aVtheir kind of conduct in these meetings and their behavior the rest of the week,
p194
aVbut the truth is it didn't really bother us.
p195
aVIt felt like we were kind of laying these underground cables
p196
aVthat wouldn't light up their world for many years to come.
p197
aa(lp198
VThree years later \u2014 our girls are almost eight now \u2014
p199
aVWe're still holding these meetings.
p200
aVMy wife counts them among her most treasured moments as a mom.
p201
aa(lp202
VSo what did we learn?
p203
aVThe word "agile" entered the lexicon in 2001
p204
aVwhen Jeff Sutherland and a group of designers
p205
aVmet in Utah and wrote a 12-point Agile Manifesto.
p206
aVI think the time is right for an Agile Family Manifesto.
p207
aVI've taken some ideas from the Starrs and from many other families I met.
p208
aVI'm proposing three planks.
p209
aa(lp210
VPlank number one: Adapt all the time.
p211
aa(lp212
VWhen I became a parent, I figured, you know what?
p213
aVWe'll set a few rules and we'll stick to them.
p214
aVThat assumes, as parents, we can anticipate every problem that's going to arise.
p215
aVWe can't. What's great about the agile system
p216
aVis you build in a system of change
p217
aVso that you can react to what's happening to you in real time.
p218
aVIt's like they say in the Internet world:
p219
aVif you're doing the same thing today you were doing six months ago,
p220
aVyou're doing the wrong thing.
p221
aVParents can learn a lot from that.
p222
aVBut to me, "adapt all the time" means something deeper, too.
p223
aVWe have to break parents out of this straitjacket
p224
aVthat the only ideas we can try at home
p225
aVare ones that come from shrinks or self-help gurus
p226
aVor other family experts.
p227
aVThe truth is, their ideas are stale,
p228
aVwhereas in all these other worlds there are these new ideas
p229
aVto make groups and teams work effectively.
p230
aa(lp231
VLet's just take a few examples.
p232
aVLet's take the biggest issue of all: family dinner.
p233
aVEverybody knows that having family dinner
p234
aVwith your children is good for the kids.
p235
aVBut for so many of us, it doesn't work in our lives.
p236
aVI met a celebrity chef in New Orleans who said,
p237
aV"No problem, I'll just time-shift family dinner.
p238
aVI'm not home, can't make family dinner?
p239
aVWe'll have family breakfast. We'll meet for a bedtime snack.
p240
aVWe'll make Sunday meals more important."
p241
aVAnd the truth is, recent research backs him up.
p242
aVIt turns out there's only 10 minutes of productive time
p243
aVin any family meal.
p244
aVThe rest of it's taken up with "take your elbows off the table" and "pass the ketchup."
p245
aVYou can take that 10 minutes and move it
p246
aVto any part of the day and have the same benefit.
p247
aVSo time-shift family dinner. That's adaptability.
p248
aa(lp249
VAn environmental psychologist told me,
p250
aV"If you're sitting in a hard chair on a rigid surface,
p251
aVyou'll be more rigid.
p252
aVIf you're sitting on a cushioned chair, you'll be more open."
p253
aVShe told me, "When you're discipling your children,
p254
aVsit in an upright chair with a cushioned surface.
p255
aVThe conversation will go better."
p256
aVMy wife and I actually moved where we sit for difficult conversations
p257
aVbecause I was sitting above in the power position.
p258
aVSo move where you sit. That's adaptability.
p259
aa(lp260
VThe point is there are all these new ideas out there.
p261
aVWe've got to hook them up with parents.
p262
aVSo plank number one: Adapt all the time.
p263
aVBe flexible, be open-minded, let the best ideas win.
p264
aa(lp265
VPlank number two: Empower your children.
p266
aVOur instinct as parents is to order our kids around.
p267
aVIt's easier, and frankly, we're usually right.
p268
aVThere's a reason that few systems have been more
p269
aVwaterfall over time than the family.
p270
aVBut the single biggest lesson we learned
p271
aVis to reverse the waterfall as much as possible.
p272
aVEnlist the children in their own upbringing.
p273
aVJust yesterday, we were having our family meeting,
p274
aVand we had voted to work on overreacting.
p275
aVSo we said, "Okay, give us a reward and give us a punishment. Okay?"
p276
aVSo one of my daughters threw out, you get five minutes of overreacting time all week.
p277
aVSo we kind of liked that.
p278
aVBut then her sister started working the system.
p279
aVShe said, "Do I get one five-minute overreaction
p280
aVor can I get 10 30-second overreactions?"
p281
aVI loved that. Spend the time however you want.
p282
aVNow give us a punishment. Okay.
p283
aVIf we get 15 minutes of overreaction time, that's the limit.
p284
aVEvery minute above that, we have to do one pushup.
p285
aVSo you see, this is working. Now look, this system isn't lax.
p286
aVThere's plenty of parental authority going on.
p287
aVBut we're giving them practice becoming independent,
p288
aVwhich of course is our ultimate goal.
p289
aVJust as I was leaving to come here tonight,
p290
aVone of my daughters started screaming.
p291
aVThe other one said, "Overreaction! Overreaction!"
p292
aVand started counting, and within 10 seconds it had ended.
p293
aVTo me that is a certified agile miracle.
p294
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p295
aVAnd by the way, research backs this up too.
p296
aVChildren who plan their own goals, set weekly schedules,
p297
aVevaluate their own work build up their frontal cortex
p298
aVand take more control over their lives.
p299
aVThe point is, we have to let our children succeed on their own terms,
p300
aVand yes, on occasion, fail on their own terms.
p301
aVI was talking to Warren Buffett's banker,
p302
aVand he was chiding me for not letting my children
p303
aVmake mistakes with their allowance.
p304
aVAnd I said, "But what if they drive into a ditch?"
p305
aVHe said, "It's much better to drive into a ditch
p306
aVwith a $6 allowance than a $60,000-a-year salary
p307
aVor a $6 million inheritance."
p308
aVSo the bottom line is, empower your children.
p309
aa(lp310
VPlank number three: Tell your story.
p311
aVAdaptability is fine, but we also need bedrock.
p312
aVJim Collins, the author of "Good To Great,"
p313
aVtold me that successful human organizations of any kind
p314
aVhave two things in common:
p315
aVthey preserve the core, they stimulate progress.
p316
aVSo agile is great for stimulating progress,
p317
aVbut I kept hearing time and again, you need to preserve the core.
p318
aVSo how do you do that?
p319
aVCollins coached us on doing something
p320
aVthat businesses do, which is define your mission
p321
aVand identify your core values.
p322
aVSo he led us through the process of creating a family mission statement.
p323
aVWe did the family equivalent of a corporate retreat.
p324
aVWe had a pajama party.
p325
aVI made popcorn. Actually, I burned one, so I made two.
p326
aVMy wife bought a flip chart.
p327
aVAnd we had this great conversation, like, what's important to us?
p328
aVWhat values do we most uphold?
p329
aVAnd we ended up with 10 statements.
p330
aVWe are travelers, not tourists.
p331
aVWe don't like dilemmas. We like solutions.
p332
aVAgain, research shows that parents should spend less time
p333
aVworrying about what they do wrong
p334
aVand more time focusing on what they do right,
p335
aVworry less about the bad times and build up the good times.
p336
aVThis family mission statement is a great way to identify
p337
aVwhat it is that you do right.
p338
aa(lp339
VA few weeks later, we got a call from the school.
p340
aVOne of our daughters had gotten into a spat.
p341
aVAnd suddenly we were worried, like, do we have a mean girl on our hands?
p342
aVAnd we didn't really know what to do,
p343
aVso we called her into my office.
p344
aVThe family mission statement was on the wall,
p345
aVand my wife said, "So, anything up there seem to apply?"
p346
aVAnd she kind of looked down the list, and she said,
p347
aV"Bring people together?"
p348
aVSuddenly we had a way into the conversation.
p349
aa(lp350
VAnother great way to tell your story
p351
aVis to tell your children where they came from.
p352
aVResearchers at Emory gave children a simple
p353
aV"what do you know" test.
p354
aVDo you know where your grandparents were born?
p355
aVDo you know where your parents went to high school?
p356
aVDo you know anybody in your family
p357
aVwho had a difficult situation, an illness, and they overcame it?
p358
aVThe children who scored highest on this "do you know" scale
p359
aVhad the highest self-esteem and a greater sense they could control their lives.
p360
aVThe "do you know" test was the single biggest predictor
p361
aVof emotional health and happiness.
p362
aVAs the author of the study told me,
p363
aVchildren who have a sense of \u2014 they're part of a larger narrative
p364
aVhave greater self-confidence.
p365
aVSo my final plank is, tell your story.
p366
aVSpend time retelling the story of your family's positive moments
p367
aVand how you overcame the negative ones.
p368
aVIf you give children this happy narrative,
p369
aVyou give them the tools to make themselves happier.
p370
aa(lp371
VI was a teenager when I first read "Anna Karenina"
p372
aVand its famous opening sentence,
p373
aV"All happy families are alike.
p374
aVEach unhappy family is unhappy in its own way."
p375
aVWhen I first read that, I thought, "That sentence is inane.
p376
aVOf course all happy families aren't alike."
p377
aVBut as I began working on this project,
p378
aVI began changing my mind.
p379
aVRecent scholarship has allowed us, for the first time,
p380
aVto identify the building blocks
p381
aVthat successful families have.
p382
aVI've mentioned just three here today:
p383
aVAdapt all the time, empower the children, tell your story.
p384
aVIs it possible, all these years later, to say Tolstoy was right?
p385
aVThe answer, I believe, is yes.
p386
aVWhen Leo Tolstoy was five years old,
p387
aVhis brother Nikolay came to him
p388
aVand said he had engraved the secret to universal happiness
p389
aVon a little green stick, which he had hidden
p390
aVin a ravine on the family's estate in Russia.
p391
aVIf the stick were ever found, all humankind would be happy.
p392
aVTolstoy became consumed with that stick, but he never found it.
p393
aVIn fact, he asked to be buried in that ravine where he thought it was hidden.
p394
aVHe still lies there today, covered in a layer of green grass.
p395
aVThat story perfectly captures for me
p396
aVthe final lesson that I learned:
p397
aVHappiness is not something we find,
p398
aVit's something we make.
p399
aVAlmost anybody who's looked at well-run organizations
p400
aVhas come to pretty much the same conclusion.
p401
aVGreatness is not a matter of circumstance.
p402
aVIt's a matter of choice.
p403
aVYou don't need some grand plan. You don't need a waterfall.
p404
aVYou just need to take small steps,
p405
aVaccumulate small wins,
p406
aVkeep reaching for that green stick.
p407
aVIn the end, this may be the greatest lesson of all.
p408
aVWhat's the secret to a happy family? Try.
