VSo, I'm afraid.
p4
aVRight now,
p5
aVon this stage,
p6
aVI feel fear.
p7
aVIn my life, I ain't met many people
p8
aVthat will readily admit when they are afraid.
p9
aVAnd I think that's because deep down,
p10
aVthey know how easy it spreads.
p11
aVSee, fear is like a disease.
p12
aVWhen it moves, it moves like wildfire.
p13
aVBut what happens when,
p14
aVeven in the face of that fear,
p15
aVyou do what you've got to do?
p16
aVThat's called courage.
p17
aVAnd just like fear,
p18
aVcourage is contagious.
p19
aa(lp20
VSee, I'm from East St. Louis, Illinois.
p21
aVThat's a small city
p22
aVacross the Mississippi River from St. Louis, Missouri.
p23
aVI have lived in and around St. Louis my entire life.
p24
aVWhen Michael Brown, Jr.,
p25
aVan ordinary teenager,
p26
aVwas gunned down by police in 2014 in Ferguson, Missouri \u2014
p27
aVanother suburb, but north of St. Louis \u2014
p28
aVI remember thinking,
p29
aVhe ain't the first,
p30
aVand he won't be the last young kid to lose his life to law enforcement.
p31
aa(lp32
VBut see, his death was different.
p33
aVWhen Mike was killed,
p34
aVI remember the powers that be trying to use fear as a weapon.
p35
aVThe police response to a community in mourning was to use force
p36
aVto impose fear:
p37
aVfear of militarized police,
p38
aVimprisonment,
p39
aVfines.
p40
aVThe media even tried to make us afraid of each other
p41
aVby the way they spun the story.
p42
aVAnd all of these things have worked in the past.
p43
aVBut like I said, this time it was different.
p44
aa(lp45
VMichael Brown's death and the subsequent treatment of the community
p46
aVled to a string of protests in and around Ferguson and St. Louis.
p47
aVWhen I got out to those protests about the fourth or fifth day,
p48
aVit was not out of courage;
p49
aVit was out of guilt.
p50
aVSee, I'm black.
p51
aVI don't know if y'all noticed that.
p52
aa(lp53
V(Laughter)
p54
aa(lp55
VBut I couldn't sit in St. Louis, minutes away from Ferguson,
p56
aVand not go see.
p57
aVSo I got off my ass to go check it out.
p58
aa(lp59
VWhen I got out there,
p60
aVI found something surprising.
p61
aVI found anger; there was a lot of that.
p62
aVBut what I found more of was love.
p63
aVPeople with love for themselves.
p64
aVLove for their community.
p65
aVAnd it was beautiful \u2014
p66
aVuntil the police showed up.
p67
aVThen a new emotion was interjected into the conversation:
p68
aVfear.
p69
aa(lp70
VNow, I'm not going to lie;
p71
aVwhen I saw those armored vehicles,
p72
aVand all that gear
p73
aVand all those guns
p74
aVand all those police
p75
aVI was terrified \u2014
p76
aVpersonally.
p77
aVAnd when I looked around that crowd,
p78
aVI saw a lot of people that had the same thing going on.
p79
aVBut I also saw people with something else inside of them.
p80
aVThat was courage.
p81
aVSee, those people yelled,
p82
aVand they screamed,
p83
aVand they were not about to back down from the police.
p84
aVThey were past that point.
p85
aVAnd then I could feel something in me changing,
p86
aVso I yelled and I screamed,
p87
aVand I noticed that everybody around me was doing the same thing.
p88
aVAnd there was nothing like that feeling.
p89
aa(lp90
VSo I decided I wanted to do something more.
p91
aVI went home, I thought: I'm an artist. I make shit.
p92
aVSo I started making things specific to the protest,
p93
aVthings that would be weapons in a spiritual war,
p94
aVthings that would give people voice
p95
aVand things that would fortify them for the road ahead.
p96
aa(lp97
VI did a project where I took pictures of the hands of protesters
p98
aVand put them up and down the boarded-up buildings
p99
aVand community shops.
p100
aVMy goal was to raise awareness and to raise the morale.
p101
aVAnd I think, for a minute at least,
p102
aVit did just that.
p103
aVThen I thought, I want to uplift the stories of these people
p104
aVI was watching being courageous in the moment.
p105
aVAnd myself and my friend,
p106
aVand filmmaker and partner Sabaah Folayan
p107
aVdid just that with our documentary,
p108
aV"Whose Streets?"
p109
aa(lp110
VI kind of became a conduit
p111
aVfor all of this courage that was given to me.
p112
aVAnd I think that's part of our job as artists.
p113
aVI think we should be conveyors of courage in the work that we do.
p114
aVAnd I think that we are the wall between the normal folks
p115
aVand the people that use their power to spread fear and hate,
p116
aVespecially in times like these.
p117
aa(lp118
VSo I'm going to ask you.
p119
aVY'all the movers and the shakers,
p120
aVyou know, the thought leaders:
p121
aVWhat are you gonna do
p122
aVwith the gifts that you've been given
p123
aVto break us from the fear the binds us every day?
p124
aa(lp125
VBecause, see, I'm afraid every day.
p126
aVI can't remember a time when I wasn't.
p127
aVBut once I figured out that fear was not put in me to cripple me,
p128
aVit was there to protect me,
p129
aVand once I figured out how to use that fear,
p130
aVI found my power.
p131
aa(lp132
VThank you.
