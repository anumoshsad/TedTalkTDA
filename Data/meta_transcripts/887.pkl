VI would be willing to bet I'm the dumbest guy in the room,
p4
aVbecause I couldn't get through school; I struggled with school.
p5
aVBut I knew at a very early age that I loved money, I loved business
p6
aVand I loved this entrepreneurial thing.
p7
aVI was raised to be an entrepreneur.
p8
aVWhat I've been really passionate about ever since \u2014
p9
aVand I've never spoken about this ever, until now \u2014
p10
aVso this is the first time anyone's heard it,
p11
aVexcept my wife, three days ago.
p12
aVShe said, "What are you talking about?"
p13
aVI told her that I think we miss an opportunity
p14
aVto find these kids who have the entrepreneurial traits,
p15
aVand to groom them or show them
p16
aVthat being an entrepreneur is actually a cool thing.
p17
aVIt's not something that is a bad thing and is vilified,
p18
aVwhich is what happens in a lot of society.
p19
aa(lp20
VKids, when we grow up, have dreams,
p21
aVand we have passions, and we have visions,
p22
aVand somehow we get those things crushed.
p23
aVWe get told that we need to study harder
p24
aVor be more focused or get a tutor.
p25
aVMy parents got me a tutor in French, and I still suck in French.
p26
aVTwo years ago,
p27
aVI was the highest-rated lecturer at MIT's Entrepreneurial Master's Program.
p28
aVIt was a speaking event in front of groups of entrepreneurs
p29
aVfrom around the world.
p30
aVWhen I was in grade two, I won a citywide speaking competition,
p31
aVbut nobody had ever said, "Hey, this kid's a good speaker.
p32
aVHe can't focus, but he loves walking around and getting people energized."
p33
aVNo one said, "Get him a coach in speaking."
p34
aVThey said, get me a tutor in what I suck at.
p35
aa(lp36
VSo as kids show these traits \u2014 and we need to start looking for them \u2014
p37
aVI think we should be raising kids to be entrepreneurs instead of lawyers.
p38
aVUnfortunately, the school system is grooming this world to say,
p39
aV"Let's be a lawyer," or, "Let's be a doctor."
p40
aVWe're missing that opportunity,
p41
aVbecause no one ever says, "Hey, be an entrepreneur."
p42
aVEntrepreneurs are people \u2014 we have a lot of them in this room \u2014
p43
aVwho have ideas and passions or see these needs in the world
p44
aVand decide to stand up and do it.
p45
aVAnd we put everything on the line to make that stuff happen.
p46
aVWe have the ability to get the groups of people around us
p47
aVthat want to build that dream with us.
p48
aVAnd I think if we could get kids to embrace the idea at a young age,
p49
aVof being entrepreneurial,
p50
aVwe could change everything in the world that's a problem today.
p51
aVEvery problem out there, somebody has the idea for.
p52
aVAnd as a young kid, nobody can say it can't happen,
p53
aVbecause you're too dumb to realize that you couldn't figure it out.
p54
aa(lp55
VI think we have an obligation as parents and a society
p56
aVto start teaching our kids to fish instead of giving them the fish \u2014
p57
aVthe old parable: "Give a man a fish, you feed him for a day.
p58
aVTeach a man to fish, you feed him for a lifetime."
p59
aVIf we can teach our kids to be entrepreneurial,
p60
aVthe ones that show the traits to be,
p61
aVlike we teach the ones who have science gifts to go on in science,
p62
aVwhat if we saw the ones with entrepreneurial traits
p63
aVand taught them to be entrepreneurs?
p64
aVWe could have these kids spreading businesses
p65
aVinstead of waiting for government handouts.
p66
aa(lp67
VWhat we do is teach our kids the things they shouldn't do:
p68
aVdon't hit; don't bite; don't swear.
p69
aVRight now we teach our kids to go after really good jobs;
p70
aVthe school system teaches them to go after things like
p71
aVbeing a doctor and being a lawyer and being an accountant and a dentist
p72
aVand a teacher and a pilot.
p73
aVAnd the media says it's really cool if we could go out
p74
aVand be a model or a singer
p75
aVor a sports hero like Luongo or Crosby.
p76
aVOur MBA programs do not teach kids to be entrepreneurs.
p77
aVThe reason I avoided an MBA program, other than that I didn't get into any,
p78
aVsince I had a 61 percent average out of high school,
p79
aVthen a 61 percent average
p80
aVat the only school in Canada that accepted me, Carlton,
p81
aVis that our MBA programs don't teach kids to be entrepreneurs.
p82
aVThey teach them to work in corporations.
p83
aa(lp84
VSo who's starting these companies? It's these random few people.
p85
aVEven in popular literature, the only book I've ever found \u2014
p86
aVand this should be on all your reading lists \u2014
p87
aVthe only book I've ever found
p88
aVthat makes the entrepreneur a hero is "Atlas Shrugged."
p89
aVEverything else in the world looks at entrepreneurs
p90
aVand says we're bad people.
p91
aVI look at even my family.
p92
aVBoth my grandfathers and my dad were entrepreneurs.
p93
aVMy brother, sister and I, all three of us own companies as well.
p94
aVWe all decided to start these things because it's the only place we fit.
p95
aVWe didn't fit in normal work; we couldn't work for somebody else,
p96
aVwe're stubborn and we have all these other traits.
p97
aa(lp98
VBut kids could be entrepreneurs as well.
p99
aVI'm a big part of a couple organizations
p100
aVcalled the Entrepreneurs' Organization and the Young Presidents' Organization.
p101
aVI just came back from speaking in Barcelona at the YPO global conference.
p102
aVAnd everyone I met over there who's an entrepreneur
p103
aVstruggled with school.
p104
aVI have 18 out of the 19 signs of attention deficit disorder diagnosed.
p105
aVSo this thing right here is freaking me out.
p106
aa(lp107
V(Laughter)
p108
aa(lp109
VIt's probably why I'm a bit panicked,
p110
aVother than all the caffeine I've had and the sugar.
p111
aVBut this is really creepy for an entrepreneur.
p112
aVAttention deficit disorder, bipolar disorder.
p113
aVDo you know that bipolar disorder is nicknamed the CEO disease?
p114
aVTed Turner's got it. Steve Jobs has it.
p115
aVAll three of the founders of Netscape had it.
p116
aVI could go on and on.
p117
aVKids \u2014 you can see these signs in kids.
p118
aVAnd we're giving them Ritalin and saying,
p119
aV"Don't be an entrepreneurial type.
p120
aVFit into this other system and try to become a student."
p121
aVSorry, entrepreneurs aren't students.
p122
aVWe fast-track. We figure out the game.
p123
aVI stole essays. I cheated on exams.
p124
aVI hired kids to do my accounting assignments in university
p125
aVfor 13 consecutive assignments.
p126
aVBut as an entrepreneur, you don't do accounting, you hire accountants.
p127
aVSo I just figured that out earlier.
p128
aa(lp129
V(Laughter)
p130
aa(lp131
V(Applause)
p132
aa(lp133
VAt least I can admit I cheated in university; most of you won't.
p134
aVI'm also quoted \u2014 and I told the person who wrote the textbook \u2014
p135
aVI'm now quoted in that exact same university textbook
p136
aVin every Canadian university and college studies \u2014
p137
aVin managerial accounting, I'm chapter eight.
p138
aVI open up chapter eight, talking about budgeting.
p139
aVI told the author, after they did my interview,
p140
aVthat I cheated in that same course.
p141
aVShe thought it was too funny to not include it.
p142
aa(lp143
VBut kids, you can see these signs in them.
p144
aVThe definition of entrepreneur is "a person who organizes, operates
p145
aVand assumes the risk of a business venture."
p146
aVThat doesn't mean you have to go to an MBA program,
p147
aVor that you have to get through school.
p148
aVIt just means that those few things have to feel right in your gut.
p149
aVWe've heard, "Is it nurture or is it nature?" Right?
p150
aVIs it thing one or thing two? What is it?
p151
aVWell, I don't think it's either. I think it can be both.
p152
aVI was groomed as an entrepreneur.
p153
aa(lp154
VWhen I was growing up as a young kid, I had no choice,
p155
aVbecause I was taught at a very early age,
p156
aVwhen my dad realized I didn't fit into everything else
p157
aVthat was being taught to me in school,
p158
aVthat he could teach me to figure out business at an early age.
p159
aVHe groomed us, the three of us, to hate the thought of having a job
p160
aVand to love the fact of creating companies
p161
aVwhere we could employ other people.
p162
aa(lp163
VMy first business venture: I was seven years old, in Winnipeg.
p164
aVI was in my bedroom with one of those long extension cords,
p165
aVcalling all the dry cleaners in Winnipeg
p166
aVto find out how much they'd pay me for coat hangers.
p167
aVAnd my mom came into the room and said,
p168
aV"Where are you going to get the hangers to sell to the dry cleaners?"
p169
aVAnd I said, "Let's go look in the basement."
p170
aVWe went down to the basement, and I opened up this cupboard.
p171
aVThere was about 1,000 hangers that I'd collected,
p172
aVbecause, when I told her I was going out to play,
p173
aVI was going door to door in the neighborhood
p174
aVto collect hangers to put in the basement,
p175
aVbecause I saw her a few weeks before that \u2014
p176
aVyou could get paid, they used to pay two cents per coat hanger.
p177
aVSo I was like, well, there's all kinds of hangers,
p178
aVso I'll just go get them.
p179
aVI knew she wouldn't want me to get them,
p180
aVso I just did it anyway.
p181
aVAnd I learned that you could actually negotiate with people.
p182
aVThis one guy offered me three cents and I got him up to three and a half.
p183
aVI even knew at seven years old
p184
aVthat I could get a fractional percent of a cent,
p185
aVand people would pay it, because it multiplied up.
p186
aVAt seven years old I figured it out.
p187
aVI got three and a half cents for 1,000 hangers.
p188
aa(lp189
VI sold license plate protectors door to door.
p190
aVMy dad actually made me go find someone
p191
aVwho would sell me them at wholesale.
p192
aVAt nine years old, I walked around in the city of Sudbury
p193
aVselling license-plate protectors door to door.
p194
aVAnd I remember this one customer so vividly \u2014
p195
aVI also did some other stuff with these clients, I sold newspapers,
p196
aVand he wouldn't buy a newspaper from me, ever.
p197
aVBut I was convinced I was going to get him to buy a license-plate protector.
p198
aVAnd he's like, "We don't need one."
p199
aVI said, "But you've got two cars."
p200
aVRemember, I'm nine years old.
p201
aVI'm like, "You have two cars and they don't have license-plate protectors.
p202
aVAnd this car has one license plate that's all crumpled up."
p203
aVHe said, "That's my wife's car."
p204
aVI said, "Why don't we test one on her car and see if it lasts longer?"
p205
aVSo I knew there were two cars with two license plates on each.
p206
aVIf I couldn't sell all four, I could at least get one.
p207
aVI learned that at a young age.
p208
aa(lp209
VI did comic book arbitrage.
p210
aVWhen I was about 10 years old, I sold comic books
p211
aVout of our cottage on Georgian Bay.
p212
aVI would go biking up to the end of the beach,
p213
aVbuy all the comics from the poor kids,
p214
aVthen go back to the other end of the beach to sell them to the rich kids.
p215
aVIt was obvious to me: buy low, sell high.
p216
aVYou've got this demand over here that has money.
p217
aVDon't try to sell to the poor kids; they don't have cash.
p218
aVThe rich people do. Obvious, right?
p219
aVIt's like a recession.
p220
aVSo there's a recession.
p221
aVThere's still 13 trillion dollars circulating in the US economy.
p222
aVGo get some of that. I learned that at a young age.
p223
aVI also learned, don't reveal your source:
p224
aVI got beat up after four weeks of this,
p225
aVbecause one of the rich kids found out where I was buying my comics,
p226
aVand didn't like that he was paying more.
p227
aa(lp228
VI was forced to get a paper route at 10 years old.
p229
aVI didn't want a paper route, but my dad said, "That's your next business."
p230
aVNot only did he get me one, but I had to get two.
p231
aVHe wanted me to hire someone to deliver half the papers,
p232
aVwhich I did.
p233
aVThen I realized: collecting tips is how you made all the money.
p234
aVSo I'd collect tips and get payment.
p235
aVI would collect for the papers \u2014 he could just deliver them.
p236
aVBecause then I realized I could make money.
p237
aVBy this point, I was definitely not going to be an employee.
p238
aa(lp239
V(Laughter)
p240
aa(lp241
VMy dad owned an automotive and industrial repair shop.
p242
aVHe had all these old automotive parts lying around.
p243
aVThey had this old brass and copper.
p244
aVI asked what he did with it, and he said he just throws it out.
p245
aVI said, "Wouldn't somebody pay for that?" And he goes, "Maybe."
p246
aVRemember: at 10 years old, 34 years ago,
p247
aVI saw opportunity in this stuff, I saw there was money in garbage.
p248
aVAnd I collected it from the automotive shops in the area on my bicycle.
p249
aVThen my dad would drive me on Saturdays to a scrap metal recycler
p250
aVwhere I got paid.
p251
aVAnd I thought that was kind of cool.
p252
aVStrangely enough, 30 years later, we're building 1-800-GOT-JUNK?
p253
aVand making money off that, too.
p254
aa(lp255
VI built these little pincushions when I was 11 years old in Cubs.
p256
aVWe made these pincushions for our moms for Mother's Day
p257
aVout of wooden clothespins \u2014
p258
aVwhen we used to hang clothes on clotheslines outside.
p259
aVAnd you'd make these chairs.
p260
aVAnd I had these little pillows that I would sew up.
p261
aVAnd you could stuff pins in them.
p262
aVBecause people used to sew and they needed a pincushion.
p263
aVBut I realized you had to have options,
p264
aVso I spray-painted a whole bunch of them brown,
p265
aVso when I went to the door, it wasn't, "Do you want to buy one?"
p266
aVIt was, "Which color would you like?"
p267
aVI'm 10 years old; you're not going to say no,
p268
aVespecially if you have two options, the brown one or the clear one.
p269
aVSo I learned that lesson at a young age.
p270
aa(lp271
VI learned that manual labor really sucks.
p272
aVRight, like cutting lawns is brutal.
p273
aVBut because I had to cut lawns all summer for all of our neighbors
p274
aVand get paid to do that,
p275
aVI realized that recurring revenue from one client is amazing,
p276
aVthat if I land this client once,
p277
aVand every week I get paid by that person,
p278
aVthat's way better than trying to sell one clothespin thing to one person,
p279
aVbecause you can't sell them more.
p280
aVSo I love that recurring revenue model I started to learn at a young age.
p281
aa(lp282
VRemember, I was being groomed to do this. I was not allowed to have jobs.
p283
aVI would go to the golf course and caddy for people,
p284
aVbut I realized there was this one hill on our golf course, the 13th hole,
p285
aVthat had this huge hill,
p286
aVand people could never get their bags up it.
p287
aVSo I'd sit there in a lawn chair and carry for all the people
p288
aVwho didn't have caddies.
p289
aVI'd carry their golf bags to the top; they'd pay me a dollar,
p290
aVwhile my friends worked for hours hauling some guy's bag around
p291
aVfor 10 bucks.
p292
aVI'm like, "That's stupid. You have to work for five hours.
p293
aVThat doesn't make sense. Figure out a way to make more money faster.
p294
aa(lp295
VEvery week, I'd go to the corner store and buy all these pops,
p296
aVThen I'd deliver them to these 70-year-old women playing bridge.
p297
aVThey'd give me their orders for the following week.
p298
aVI'd deliver pop and charge twice.
p299
aVI had this captured market.
p300
aVYou didn't need contracts, you just needed to have a supply and demand
p301
aVand this audience who bought into you.
p302
aVThese women weren't going to go to anybody else
p303
aVbecause they liked me, and I kind of figured it out.
p304
aa(lp305
VI went and got golf balls from golf courses.
p306
aVBut everybody else was looking in the bush
p307
aVand looking in the ditches for golf balls.
p308
aVI'm like, screw that. They're in the pond. And nobody's going into the pond.
p309
aVSo I'd go into the ponds and crawl around and pick them up with my toes,
p310
aVjust pick them up with both feet.
p311
aVYou can't do it onstage.
p312
aVYou get the golf balls, throw them in your bathing suit trunks
p313
aVand when you're done, you've got a couple hundred of them.
p314
aVBut the problem is, people didn't want all the golf balls.
p315
aVSo I just packaged them. I'm like 12, right?
p316
aVI packaged them up three ways.
p317
aVI had the Pinnacles, DDHs and the really cool ones.
p318
aVThose sold for two dollars each.
p319
aVThen I had the good ones that didn't look crappy: 50 cents each.
p320
aVAnd then I'd sell 50 at a time of all the crappy ones.
p321
aVAnd they could use those for practice balls.
p322
aa(lp323
VI sold sunglasses when I was in school,
p324
aVto all the kids in high school.
p325
aVThis is what really kind of gets everybody hating you,
p326
aVbecause you're trying to extract money from all your friends all the time.
p327
aVBut it paid the bills.
p328
aVSo I sold lots and lots of sunglasses.
p329
aVThen when the school shut me down \u2014
p330
aVthey called me into the office and told me I couldn't do it \u2014
p331
aVI went to the gas stations and sold lots of them to the gas stations
p332
aVand had the gas stations sell them to their customers.
p333
aVThat was cool because then, I had retail outlets.
p334
aVI think I was 14.
p335
aa(lp336
VThen I paid my entire way through first year of university at Carlton
p337
aVby selling wineskins door to door.
p338
aVYou know you can hold a 40-ounce bottle of rum
p339
aVand two bottles of coke in a wineskin?
p340
aVSo what, right? But you know what?
p341
aVStuff that down your shorts when you go to a football game,
p342
aVyou can get booze in for free.
p343
aVEverybody bought them.
p344
aVSupply, demand, big opportunity.
p345
aVI also branded it, so I sold them for five times the normal cost.
p346
aVIt had our university logo on it.
p347
aa(lp348
VYou know, we teach our kids and we buy them games,
p349
aVbut why don't we get them games, if they're entrepreneurial kids,
p350
aVthat nurture the traits you need to be entrepreneurs?
p351
aVWhy don't you teach them not to waste money?
p352
aVI remember being told to walk out into the middle of a street
p353
aVin Banff, Alberta.
p354
aVI'd thrown a penny out in the street,
p355
aVand my dad said, "Go pick it up.
p356
aVI work too damn hard for my money. I'm not going to see you waste a penny."
p357
aVI remember that lesson to this day.
p358
aa(lp359
VAllowances teach kids the wrong habits.
p360
aVAllowances, by nature, are teaching kids to think about a job.
p361
aVAn entrepreneur doesn't expect a regular paycheck.
p362
aVAllowance is breeding kids at a young age to expect a regular paycheck.
p363
aVThat's wrong, for me, if you want to raise entrepreneurs.
p364
aVWhat I do with my kids, nine and seven,
p365
aVis teach them to walk around the house and the yard,
p366
aVlooking for stuff that needs to get done.
p367
aVCome and tell me what it is.
p368
aVOr I'll say, "Here's what I need done."
p369
aVAnd then, you know what we do? We negotiate.
p370
aVThey go around looking for what it is,
p371
aVthen we negotiate what they'll get paid.
p372
aVThey don't have a regular check,
p373
aVbut they have opportunities to find more stuff,
p374
aVand learn the skill of negotiating and of finding opportunities.
p375
aa(lp376
VYou breed that kind of stuff.
p377
aVEach of my kids has two piggy banks.
p378
aVFifty percent of all the money they earn goes in their house account,
p379
aV50 percent goes in their toy account.
p380
aVThe toy account, they spend on whatever they want.
p381
aVThe 50 percent in their house account, every six months, goes to the bank.
p382
aVthey walk up with me.
p383
aVEvery year, all the money in the bank goes to their broker.
p384
aVBoth my nine- and seven-year-olds have a stockbroker already.
p385
aVI'm teaching them to force that savings habit.
p386
aVIt drives me crazy that 30-year-olds are saying,
p387
aV"Maybe I'll start contributing to my RSP now."
p388
aVShit, you've missed 25 years.
p389
aVYou can teach those habits to young kids,
p390
aVwhen they don't even feel the pain yet.
p391
aa(lp392
VDon't read bedtime stories every night \u2014 maybe four nights of the week,
p393
aVand three nights, have them tell stories.
p394
aVWhy don't you sit down with kids and give them four items,
p395
aVa red shirt, a blue tie, a kangaroo and a laptop,
p396
aVand have them tell a story about those four things?
p397
aVMy kids do that all the time.
p398
aVIt teaches them to sell, teaches them creativity,
p399
aVteaches them to think on their feet.
p400
aVDo that kind of stuff, have fun with it.
p401
aa(lp402
VGet kids to stand up in front of groups and talk,
p403
