VOver the past six months, I've spent my time
p4
aVtraveling. I think I've done 60,000 miles,
p5
aVbut without leaving my desk.
p6
aVAnd the reason I can do that is because I'm actually two people.
p7
aVI look like one person but I'm two people. I'm Eddie who is here,
p8
aVand at the same time, my alter ego is a big green boxy
p9
aVavatar nicknamed Cyber Frank.
p10
aa(lp11
VSo that's what I spend my time doing. I'd like to start,
p12
aVif it's possible, with a test, because I do business stuff,
p13
aVso it's important that we focus on outcomes.
p14
aVAnd then I struggled, because I was thinking to myself,
p15
aV"What should I talk? What should I do? It's a TED audience.
p16
aVIt's got to be stretching. How am I going to make \u2014 ?"
p17
aVSo I just hope I've got the level of difficulty right.
p18
aVSo let's just walk our way through this.
p19
aVPlease could you work this through with me? You can shout out the answer if you like.
p20
aVThe question is, which of these horizontal lines is longer?
p21
aVThe answer is?
p22
aVAudience: The same.Eddie Obeng: The same.
p23
aVNo, they're not the same. (Laughter)
p24
aVThey're not the same. The top one is 10 percent longer than the bottom one.
p25
aVSo why did you tell me they were the same? Do you remember when we were kids at school,
p26
aVabout that big, they played the same trick on us?
p27
aVIt was to teach us parallax. Do you remember?
p28
aVAnd you got, you said, "It's the same!" And you got it wrong.
p29
aVYou remember? And you learned the answer, and you've carried this answer in your head for 10, 20, 30, 40 years:
p30
aVThe answer is the same. The answer is the same. So when you're asked what the lengths are,
p31
aVyou say they're the same, but they're not the same, because I've changed it.
p32
aa(lp33
VAnd this is what I'm trying to explain has happened to us in the 21st century.
p34
aVSomebody or something has changed the rules
p35
aVabout how our world works.
p36
aVWhen I'm joking, I try and explain it happened at midnight,
p37
aVyou see, while we were asleep, but it was midnight 15 years ago. Okay?
p38
aVYou didn't notice it? But basically, what they do is,
p39
aVthey switched all the rules round, so that the way to
p40
aVsuccessfully run a business, an organization, or even a country,
p41
aVhas been deleted, flipped, and it's a completely new
p42
aV\u2014 you think I'm joking, don't you \u2014 there's a completely new set of rules in operation. (Laughter)
p43
aVDid you notice that? I mean, you missed this one.
p44
aVYou probably \u2014 No, you didn't. Okay. (Laughter)
p45
aa(lp46
VMy simple idea is that what's happened is,
p47
aVthe real 21st century around us isn't so obvious to us,
p48
aVso instead we spend our time responding rationally
p49
aVto a world which we understand and recognize,
p50
aVbut which no longer exists.
p51
aVYou don't believe me, do you? Okay. (Applause)
p52
aa(lp53
VSo let me take you on a little journey of many of the things I don't understand.
p54
aVIf you search Amazon for the word "creativity,"
p55
aVyou'll discover something like 90,000 books.
p56
aVIf you go on Google and you look for "innovation + creativity,"
p57
aVyou get 30 million hits. If you add the word "consultants," it doubles to 60 million. (Laughter)
p58
aVAre you with me? And yet, statistically, what you discover
p59
aVis that about one in 100,000 ideas is found making money
p60
aVor delivering benefits two years after its inception.
p61
aVIt makes no sense. Companies make their expensive executives
p62
aVspend ages carefully preparing forecasts and budgets
p63
aVwhich are obsolete or need changing before they can be published.
p64
aa(lp65
VHow is that possible? If you look at the visions we have,
p66
aVthe visions of how we're going to change the world,
p67
aVthe key thing is implementation. We have the vision.
p68
aVWe've got to make it happen.
p69
aVWe've spent decades professionalizing implementation.
p70
aVPeople are supposed to be good at making stuff happen.
p71
aVHowever, if I use as an example a family of five
p72
aVgoing on holiday, if you can imagine this,
p73
aVall the way from London all the way across to Hong Kong,
p74
aVwhat I want you to think about is their budget is only 3,000 pounds of expenses.
p75
aVWhat actually happens is, if I compare this to the average
p76
aVreal project, average real successful project,
p77
aVthe family actually end up in Makassar, South Sulawesi,
p78
aVat a cost of 4,000 pounds,
p79
aVwhilst leaving two of the children behind. (Laughter)
p80
aVWhat I'm trying to explain to you is, there are things which don't make sense to us.
p81
aa(lp82
VIt gets even worse than that. Let me just walk you through this one.
p83
aVThis is a quote, and I'll just pick words out of it.
p84
aVIt says \u2014 I'll put on the voice \u2014 "In summary, your Majesty,
p85
aVthe failure to foresee the timing, extent and severity
p86
aVof the crisis was due to the lack of creativity
p87
aVand the number of bright minds," or something like that.
p88
aVThis was a group of eminent economists apologizing to the Queen of England
p89
aVwhen she asked the question,
p90
aV"Why did no one tell us that the crisis was coming?" (Laughter)
p91
aVI'll never get my knighthood. I'll never get my knighthood. (Laughter)
p92
aVThat's not the important point. The thing you have to remember is,
p93
aVthese are eminent economists, some of the smartest people
p94
aVon the planet. Do you see the challenge? (Laughter)
p95
aa(lp96
VIt's scary. My friend and mentor, Tim Brown of IDEO,
p97
aVhe explains that design must get big, and he's right.
p98
aVHe wisely explains this to us. He says design thinking
p99
aVmust tackle big systems for the challenges we have.
p100
aVHe's absolutely right.
p101
aVAnd then I ask myself, "Why was it ever small?"
p102
aVIsn't it weird? You know, if collaboration is so cool,
p103
aVis cross-functional working is so amazing,
p104
aVwhy did we build these huge hierarchies? What's going on?
p105
aVYou see, I think what's happened, perhaps, is that
p106
aVwe've not noticed that change I described earlier.
p107
aa(lp108
VWhat we do know is that the world has accelerated.
p109
aVCyberspace moves everything at the speed of light.
p110
aVTechnology accelerates things exponentially.
p111
aVSo if this is now, and that's the past,
p112
aVand we start thinking about change, you know,
p113
aVall governments are seeking change, you're here seeking change,
p114
aVeverybody's after change, it's really cool. (Laughter)
p115
aVSo what happens is, we get this wonderful whooshing acceleration and change.
p116
aVThe speed is accelerating. That's not the only thing.
p117
aVAt the same time, as we've done that, we've done something really weird.
p118
aVWe've doubled the population in 40 years,
p119
aVput half of them in cities, then connected them all up so they can interact.
p120
aVThe density of the interaction of human beings is amazing.
p121
aVThere are charts which show all these movements of information. That density of information is amazing.
p122
aVAnd then we've done a third thing.
p123
aVyou know, for those of you who have as an office
p124
aVa little desk underneath the stairs, and you say, well this is my little desk under the stairs,
p125
aVno! You are sitting at the headquarters of a global corporation if you're connected to the Internet.
p126
aVWhat's happened is, we've changed the scale.
p127
aVSize and scale are no longer the same.
p128
aVAnd then add to that, every time you tweet,
p129
aVover a third of your followers follow from a country
p130
aVwhich is not your own.
p131
aa(lp132
VGlobal is the new scale. We know that.
p133
aVAnd so people say things like, "The world is now a turbulent place." Have you heard them saying things like that?
p134
aVAnd they use it as a metaphor. Have you come across this?
p135
aa(lp136
VAnd they think it's a metaphor, but this is not a metaphor.
p137
aVIt's reality. As a young engineering student, I remember
p138
aVgoing to a demonstration where they basically,
p139
aVthe demonstrator did something quite intriguing.
p140
aVWhat he did was, he got a transparent pipe \u2014 have you seen this demonstration before? \u2014
p141
aVhe attached it to a tap. So effectively what you had was,
p142
aVyou had a situation where \u2014 I'll try and draw the tap
p143
aVand the pipe, actually I'll skip the tap. The taps are hard.
p144
aVOkay? So I'll write the word "tap." Is that okay? It's a tap. (Laughter)
p145
aVOkay, so he attaches it to a transparent pipe, and he turns the water on.
p146
aVAnd he says, do you notice anything? And the water is whooshing down this pipe.
p147
aVI mean, this is not exciting stuff. Are you with me?
p148
aVSo the water goes up. He turns it back down. Great.
p149
aVAnd he says, "Anything you notice?" No. Then he sticks a needle into the pipe,
p150
aVand he connects this to a container, and he fills
p151
aVthe container up with green ink. You with me?
p152
aVSo guess what happens? A thin green line comes out
p153
aVas it flows down the pipe. It's not that interesting.
p154
aVAnd then he turns the water up a bit, so it starts coming back in. And nothing changes.
p155
aVSo he's changing the flow of the water, but it's just a boring green line.
p156
aVHe adds some more. He adds some more. And then something weird happens.
p157
aVThere's this little flicker, and then as he turns it ever so slightly more,
p158
aVthe whole of that green line disappears, and instead
p159
aVthere are these little sort of inky dust devils close to the needle.
p160
aVThey're called eddies. Not me. And they're violently dispersing the ink
p161
aVso that it actually gets diluted out, and the color's gone.
p162
aa(lp163
VWhat's happened in this world of pipe
p164
aVis somebody has flipped it. They've changed the rules from laminar to turbulent.
p165
aVAll the rules are gone. In that environment, instantly,
p166
aVall the possibilities which turbulence brings are available,
p167
aVand it's not the same as laminar.
p168
aVAnd if we didn't have that green ink, you'd never notice.
p169
aa(lp170
VAnd I think this is our challenge, because somebody
p171
aVhas actually increased \u2014 and it's probably you guys with all your tech and stuff \u2014
p172
aVthe speed, the scale and the density of interaction.
p173
aa(lp174
VNow how do we cope and deal with that?
p175
aVWell, we could just call it turbulence, or we could try and learn.
p176
aVYes, learn, but I know you guys grew up in the days when
p177
aVthere were actually these things called correct answers,
p178
aVbecause of the answer you gave me to the horizontal line puzzle,
p179
aVand you believe it will last forever.
p180
aVSo I'll put a little line up here which represents learning,
p181
aVand that's how we used to do it. We could see things,
p182
aVunderstand them, take the time to put them into practice.
p183
aVOut here is the world. Now, what's happened to our pace
p184
aVof learning as the world has accelerated? Well, if you work
p185
aVfor a corporation, you'll discover it's quite difficult to work
p186
aVon stuff which your boss doesn't approve of, isn't in the strategy,
p187
aVand anyway, you've got to go through your monthly meetings.
p188
aVIf you work in an institution, one day you will get them to make that decision.
p189
aVAnd if you work in a market where people believe in cycles,
p190
aVit's even funnier, because you have to wait all the way
p191
aVfor the cycle to fail before you go, "There's something wrong." You with me?
p192
aVSo it's likely that the line, in terms of learning, is pretty flat.
p193
aVYou with me? This point over here, the point at which
p194
aVthe lines cross over, the pace of change
p195
aVovertakes the pace of learning,
p196
aVand for me, that is what I was describing
p197
aVwhen I was telling you about midnight.
p198
aa(lp199
VSo what does it do to us? Well, it completely transforms what we have to do,
p200
aVmany mistakes we make. We solve last year's problems
p201
aVwithout thinking about the future. If you try and think about it,
p202
aVthe things you're solving now, what problems are they going to bring in the future?
p203
aVIf you haven't understood the world you're living in,
p204
aVit's almost impossible to be absolutely certain that what you're going to deliver fits.
p205
aa(lp206
VI'll give you an example, a quick one. Creativity and ideas,
p207
aVI mentioned that earlier. All the CEOs around me, my clients, they want innovation,
p208
aVso they seek innovation. They say to people, "Take risks and be creative!"
p209
aVBut unfortunately the words get transformed as they travel through the air.
p210
aVEntering their ears, what they hear is, "Do crazy things and then I'll fire you." Why? (Laughter) Because \u2014
p211
aVWhy? Because in the old world, okay, in the old world,
p212
aVover here, getting stuff wrong was unacceptable.
p213
aVIf you got something wrong, you'd failed. How should you be treated?
p214
aVWell, harshly, because you could have asked somebody who had experience.
p215
aVSo we learned the answer and we carried this in our heads for 20, 30 years, are you with me?
p216
aVThe answer is, don't do things which are different.
p217
aVAnd then suddenly we tell them to and it doesn't work.
p218
aVYou see, in reality, there are two ways you can fail in our new world.
p219
aVOne, you're doing something that you should follow a procedure to, and it's a very difficult thing,
p220
aVyou're sloppy, you get it wrong. How should you be treated? You should probably be fired.
p221
aVOn the other hand, you're doing something new, no one's ever done before,
p222
aVyou get it completely wrong. How should you be treated?
p223
aVWell, free pizzas! You should be treated better than the people who succeed.
p224
aVIt's called smart failure. Why? Because you can't put it on your C.V.
p225
aa(lp226
VSo what I want to leave you, then, is with the explanation
p227
aVof why I actually traveled 60,000 miles from my desk.
p228
aVWhen I realized the power of this new world,
p229
aVI quit my safe teaching job, and set up a virtual business school,
p230
aVthe first in the world, in order to teach people how to make this happen,
p231
aVand I used some of my learnings about some of the rules which I'd learned on myself.
p232
aVIf you're interested, worldaftermidnight.com, you'll find out more,
p233
aVbut I've applied them to myself for over a decade,
p234
aVand I'm still here, and I still have my house, and the most important thing is,
p235
aVI hope I've done enough to inject a little green ink into your lives,
p236
aVso that when you go away and you're making your next
p237
aVabsolutely sensible and rational decision, you'll take some time to think,
p238
aV"Hmm, I wonder whether this also makes sense
p239
aVin our new world after midnight." Thank you very much.
p240
aV(Applause)
p241
aVThank you, thank you. (Applause)
