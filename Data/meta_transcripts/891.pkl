VI'm going to begin by reciting a poem.
p4
aV"Oh beloved dentist:
p5
aVYour rubber fingers in my mouth ...
p6
aVyour voice so soft and muffled ...
p7
aVLower the mask, dear dentist,
p8
aVlower the mask."
p9
aa(lp10
V(Laughter)
p11
aa(lp12
VOkay, in this presentation,
p13
aVI'm going to be putting the right side of your brains
p14
aVthrough a fairly serious workout.
p15
aVYou're going to see a lot of imagery,
p16
aVand it's not always connected to what I'm talking about,
p17
aVso I need you to kind of split your brains in half
p18
aVand let the images flow over one side
p19
aVand listen to me on the other.
p20
aVSo I am one of those people
p21
aVwith a transformative personal story.
p22
aVSix years ago,
p23
aVafter 20 years in graphic design and typography,
p24
aVI changed the way I was working
p25
aVand the way most graphic designers work
p26
aVto pursue a more personal approach to my work,
p27
aVwith only the humble attempt
p28
aVto simply make a living doing something that I loved.
p29
aVBut something weird happened.
p30
aVI became bizarrely
p31
aVpopular.
p32
aVMy current work
p33
aVseems to resonate with people
p34
aVin a way that has so taken me by surprise
p35
aVthat I still frequently wonder
p36
aVwhat in the hell is going on.
p37
aVAnd I'm slowly coming to understand
p38
aVthat the appeal of what I do
p39
aVmay be connected to why I do it.
p40
aa(lp41
VThese days, I call myself a graphic artist.
p42
aVSo where my work as a graphic designer
p43
aVwas to follow strategy,
p44
aVmy work now
p45
aVfollows my heart
p46
aVand my interests
p47
aVwith the guidance of my ego
p48
aVto create work that is mutually beneficial to myself and a client.
p49
aVNow, this is heresy
p50
aVin the design world.
p51
aVThe ego is not supposed
p52
aVto be involved in graphic design.
p53
aVBut I find that for myself,
p54
aVwithout exception,
p55
aVthe more I deal with the work
p56
aVas something of my own,
p57
aVas something that is personal,
p58
aVthe more successful it is
p59
aVas something that's compelling,
p60
aVinteresting and sustaining.
p61
aVSo I exist somewhat outside of the mainstream
p62
aVof design thinking.
p63
aVWhere others might look at measurable results,
p64
aVI tend to be interested in more ethereal qualities,
p65
aVlike "Does it bring joy?"
p66
aV"Is there a sense of wonder?"
p67
aVand "Does it invoke curiosity?"
p68
aa(lp69
VThis is a scientific diagram, by the way.
p70
aVI don't have time to explain it,
p71
aVbut it has to do with DNA and RNA.
p72
aVSo I have a particular imaginative approach to visual work.
p73
aVThe things that interest me when I'm working
p74
aVare visual structure,
p75
aVsurprise
p76
aVand anything that requires figuring things out.
p77
aVSo for this reason, I'm particularly drawn
p78
aVto systems and patterns.
p79
aVI'm going to give you a couple of examples of how my brain works.
p80
aa(lp81
VThis is a piece that I did for
p82
aVThe Guardian newspaper in the U.K.
p83
aVThey have a magazine that they call G2.
p84
aVAnd this is for their puzzle special
p85
aVin 2007.
p86
aVAnd puzzling it is.
p87
aVI started by creating a series of tiling units.
p88
aVAnd these tiling units, I designed
p89
aVspecifically so that they would contain
p90
aVparts of letterforms within their shapes
p91
aVso that I could then
p92
aVjoin those pieces together
p93
aVto create letters and then words
p94
aVwithin the abstract patterning.
p95
aVBut then as well, I was able to
p96
aVjust flip them, rotate them
p97
aVand combine them in different ways
p98
aVto create either regular patterns
p99
aVor abstract patterns.
p100
aVSo here's the word puzzle again.
p101
aVAnd here it is with the abstract surrounding.
p102
aVAnd as you can see, it's extremely difficult to read.
p103
aVBut all I have to do is
p104
aVfill certain areas of those letterforms
p105
aVand I can bring those words out of
p106
aVthe background pattern.
p107
aVBut maybe that's a little too obvious.
p108
aVSo then I can add some color in with the background
p109
aVand add a bit more color in with the words themselves,
p110
aVand this way, working with the art director,
p111
aVI'm able to bring it to just the right point
p112
aVthat it's puzzling for the audience \u2014
p113
aVthey can figure out that there's something they have to read \u2014
p114
aVbut it's not impossible for them to read.
p115
aa(lp116
VI'm also interested in working with
p117
aVunusual materials
p118
aVand common materials in unusual ways.
p119
aVSo this requires figuring out how to
p120
aVget the most out of something's innate properties
p121
aVand also how to bend it to my will.
p122
aVSo ultimately,
p123
aVmy goal is to create something unexpected.
p124
aVTo this end, I have worked in sugar
p125
aVfor Stefan Sagmeister,
p126
aVthree-time TED speaker.
p127
aVAnd this project began essentially
p128
aVon my kitchen table.
p129
aVI've been eating cereal for breakfast
p130
aVall of my life.
p131
aVAnd for that same amount of time,
p132
aVI've been spilling sugar on the table
p133
aVand just kind of playing with it with my fingers.
p134
aVAnd eventually I used this technique
p135
aVto create a piece of artwork.
p136
aVAnd then I used it again to create
p137
aVsix pieces for Stefan's book,
p138
aV"Things in My Life I've Learned So Far."
p139
aVAnd these were created
p140
aVwithout sketches, just freehand,
p141
aVby putting the sugar down on a white surface
p142
aVand then manipulating it to get
p143
aVthe words and designs out of it.
p144
aVRecently, I've also made some
p145
aVrather highbrow baroque borders
p146
aVout of lowbrow pasta.
p147
aVAnd this is for a chapter that I'm doing in a book,
p148
aVand the chapter is on honor.
p149
aVSo it's a little bit unexpected,
p150
aVbut, in a way, it refers
p151
aVto the macaroni art
p152
aVthat children make for their parents
p153
aVor they make in school and give to their parents,
p154
aVwhich is in itself a form of honor.
p155
aVThis is what you can do with some household tinfoil.
p156
aVOkay, well, it's what I can do with some household tinfoil.
p157
aa(lp158
V(Laughter)
p159
aa(lp160
VI'm very interested in wonder,
p161
aVin design as an impetus to inquiring.
p162
aVTo say I wonder is to say
p163
aVI question, I ask.
p164
aVAnd to experience wonder is to experience awe.
p165
aVSo I'm currently working on a book,
p166
aVwhich plays with both senses of the word,
p167
aVas I explore some of my own ideas
p168
aVand inquiries
p169
aVin a visual display of rather
p170
aVpeacock-like grandeur.
p171
aVThe world is full of wonder.
p172
aVBut the world of graphic design,
p173
aVfor the most part, is not.
p174
aVSo I'm using my own writings
p175
aVas a kind of testing ground for a book that has
p176
aVan interdependency between word and image
p177
aVas a kind of seductive force.
p178
aVI think that one of the things
p179
aVthat religions got right
p180
aVwas the use of visual wonder
p181
aVto deliver a message.
p182
aVI think this true marriage of art and information
p183
aVis woefully underused in adult literature,
p184
aVand I'm mystified as to
p185
aVwhy visual wealth is not more commonly used
p186
aVto enhance intellectual wealth.
p187
aVWhen we look at works like this,
p188
aVwe tend to associate them with children's literature.
p189
aVThere's an implication that ornamental graphics
p190
aVdetract from the seriousness of the content.
p191
aVBut I really hope to have the opportunity
p192
aVto change that perception.
p193
aVThis book is taking rather a long time,
p194
aVbut I'm nearly done.
p195
aa(lp196
VFor some reason, I thought it would be a good idea
p197
aVto put an intermission
p198
aVin my talk.
p199
aVAnd this is it \u2014 just to give you and me a moment to catch up.
p200
aa(lp201
V(Laughter)
p202
aa(lp203
VSo I do these valentines.
p204
aVI've been sending out valentines
p205
aVon a fairly large scale since 2005.
p206
aVThese are my valentines
p207
aVfrom 2005 and 2006.
p208
aVAnd I started by
p209
aVdoing just a single image like this
p210
aVand sending them out to each person.
p211
aVBut in 2007,
p212
aVI got the cockamamie idea
p213
aVto hand-draw each valentine
p214
aVfor everyone on my mailing list.
p215
aVI reduced my mailing list to 150 people.
p216
aVAnd I drew each person
p217
aVtheir own unique valentine
p218
aVand put their name on it
p219
aVand numbered it and signed it and sent it out.
p220
aVBelieve it or not, I devised this
p221
aVas a timesaving method.
p222
aVI was very busy in the beginning of that year,
p223
aVand I didn't know when I was going to find time
p224
aVto design and print a single valentine.
p225
aVAnd I thought that I could kind of do this piecemeal
p226
aVas I was traveling.
p227
aVIt didn't exactly work out that way.
p228
aVThere's a longer story to this,
p229
aVbut I did get them all done in time,
p230
aVand they were extremely well received.
p231
aVI got an almost 100 percent response rate.
p232
aV(Laughter)
p233
aVAnd those who didn't respond
p234
aVwill never receive anything from me ever again.
p235
aa(lp236
V(Laughter)
p237
aa(lp238
VLast year,
p239
aVI took a more conceptual approach to the valentine.
p240
aVI had this idea that I wanted people
p241
aVto receive a kind of
p242
aVmysterious love letter,
p243
aVlike a found fragment in their mailbox.
p244
aVI wanted it to be something
p245
aVthat was not addressed to them
p246
aVor signed by me,
p247
aVsomething that caused them to wonder
p248
aVwhat on Earth this thing was.
p249
aVAnd I specifically wrote
p250
aVfour pages that don't connect.
p251
aVThere were four different versions of this.
p252
aVAnd I wrote them
p253
aVso that they begin in the middle of a sentence,
p254
aVend in the middle of a sentence.
p255
aVAnd they're on the one hand, universal,
p256
aVso I avoid specific names or places,
p257
aVbut on the other hand, they're personal.
p258
aVSo I wanted people to really get the sense that
p259
aVthey had received something that could have been
p260
aVa love letter to them.
p261
aVAnd I'm just going to read one of them to you.
p262
aa(lp263
V"You've never really been sure of this,
p264
aVbut I can assure you that this quirk
p265
aVyou're so self-conscious of
p266
aVis intensely endearing.
p267
aVJust please accept that this piece of you
p268
aVescapes with your smile,
p269
aVand those of us who notice
p270
aVare happy to catch it in passing.
p271
aVTime spent with you is like chasing and catching small birds,
p272
aVbut without the scratches and bird shit."
p273
aV(Laughter)
p274
aV"That is to say,
p275
aVyour thoughts and words flit and dart,
p276
aVdisconcertedly elusive at times,
p277
aVbut when caught and examined \u2014
p278
aVahh, such a wonder,
p279
aVsuch a delightful reward.
p280
aVThere's no passing time with you,
p281
aVonly collecting \u2014
p282
aVthe collecting of moments with the hope for preservation
p283
aVand at the same time release.
p284
aVImpossible? I don't think so.
p285
aVI know this makes you embarrassed.
p286
aVI'm certain I can see you blushing.
p287
aVBut I just have to tell you because
p288
aVsometimes I hear your self-doubt,
p289
aVand it's so crushing to think
p290
aVthat you may not know how truly wonderful you are,
p291
aVhow inspiring and delightful
p292
aVand really, truly the most completely ..."

VSo Valentine's Day
p299
aVis coming up in a couple of days,
p300
aVand these are currently arriving
p301
aVin mailboxes all around the world.
p302
aVThis year, I got, what I really have to say
p303
aVis a rather brilliant idea,
p304
aVto laser cut
p305
aVmy valentines
p306
aVout of used Christmas cards.
p307
aVSo I solicited friends
p308
aVto send me their used Christmas cards,
p309
aVand I made 500 of these.
p310
aVEach one of them is completely different.
p311
aVI'm just really, really thrilled with them.
p312
aVI don't have that much else to say,
p313
aVbut they turned out really well.
p314
aa(lp315
VI do spend a lot of time on my work.
p316
aVAnd one of the things that I've been thinking about recently
p317
aVis what is worth while.
p318
aVWhat is it that's worth spending my time on
p319
aVand my life on in this way?
p320
aVWorking in the commercial world,
p321
aVthis is something that I do have to struggle with at times.
p322
aVAnd yes, sometimes I'm swayed by money.
p323
aVBut ultimately, I don't consider that a worthy goal.
p324
aVWhat makes something worthwhile for me
p325
aVis the people I work for or with,
p326
aVthe conditions I work under
p327
aVand the audience that I'm able to reach.
p328
aVSo I might ask: "Who is it for?"
p329
aV"What does it say?"
p330
aVand "What does it do?"
p331
aa(lp332
VYou know, I have to tell you, it's really difficult
p333
aVfor someone like me to come up on stage
p334
aVat this conference
p335
aVwith these unbelievably brilliant minds,
p336
aVwho are thinking these
p337
aVreally big-picture,
p338
aVworld-changing, life-changing
p339
aVideas and technologies.
p340
aVAnd it's very, very common
p341
aVfor designers and people in the visual arts
p342
aVto feel that we're
p343
aVnot contributing enough,
p344
aVor worse, that all we're doing is
p345
aVcontributing to landfill.
p346
aVHere I am; I'm showing you
p347
aVsome pretty visuals
p348
aVand talking about aesthetics.
p349
aVBut I've come to believe that
p350
aVtruly imaginative visual work
p351
aVis extremely important in society.
p352
aa(lp353
VJust in the way that I'm inspired
p354
aVby books
p355
aVand magazines of all kinds,
p356
aVconversations I have, movies,
p357
aVso I also think,
p358
aVwhen I put visual work out there into the mass media,
p359
aVwork that is interesting, unusual,
p360
aVintriguing,
p361
aVwork that maybe opens up that sense
p362
aVof inquiry in the mind,
p363
aVthat I'm seeding the imagination of the populace.
p364
aVAnd you just never know who
p365
aVis going to take something from that
p366
aVand turn it into something else,
p367
aVbecause inspiration
p368
aVis cross-pollinating.
p369
aVSo a piece of mine
p370
aVmay inspire a playwright
p371
aVor a novelist or a scientist,
p372
aVand that in turn may be the seed
p373
aVthat inspires a doctor
p374
aVor a philanthropist
p375
aVor a babysitter.
p376
aVAnd this isn't something that you can quantify
p377
aVor track or measure,
p378
aVand we tend to undervalue things in society
p379
aVthat we can't measure.
p380
aa(lp381
VBut I really believe
p382
aVthat a fully operating, rich society
p383
aVneeds these seeds coming from all directions
p384
aVand all disciplines
p385
aVin order to keep the gears of inspiration
p386
aVand imagination
p387
aVflowing and cycling and growing.
p388
aVSo that's why I do what I do,
p389
aVand why I spend so much time and effort on it,
p390
aVand why I work in the commercial, public sphere,
p391
aVas opposed to the isolated, private sphere
p392
aVof fine art:
p393
aVbecause I want as many people as possible
p394
aVto see my work, notice it, be drawn into it,
p395
aVand be able to take something from it.
p396
aVAnd I actually really feel that it's worthwhile
p397
aVto spend my valuable
p398
aVand limited time on this Earth
p399
aVin this way.
p400
aVAnd I thank you for allowing me to show it to you.
