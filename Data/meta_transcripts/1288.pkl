VIn 1994, I walked into a prison in Cambodia,
p4
aVand I met a 12-year-old boy
p5
aVwho had been tortured
p6
aVand was denied access to counsel.
p7
aVAnd as I looked into his eyes, I realized
p8
aVthat for the hundreds of letters I had written
p9
aVfor political prisoners, that I would never have
p10
aVwritten a letter for him,
p11
aVbecause he was not a 12-year-old boy who
p12
aVhad done something important for anybody.
p13
aVHe was not a political prisoner.
p14
aVHe was a 12-year-old boy who had
p15
aVstolen a bicycle.
p16
aVWhat I also realized at that point was that
p17
aVit was not only Cambodia, but
p18
aVof the 113
p19
aVdeveloping countries that torture,
p20
aV93 of these countries have all passed laws
p21
aVthat say you have a right to a lawyer
p22
aVand you have a right not to be tortured.
p23
aa(lp24
VAnd what I recognized was that there was an
p25
aVincredible window of opportunity for us
p26
aVas a world community to come together
p27
aVand end torture as an investigative tool.
p28
aVWe often think of torture as being
p29
aVpolitical torture or reserved for
p30
aVjust the worst, but, in fact,
p31
aV95 percent of torture today
p32
aVis not for political prisoners.
p33
aVIt is for people who are
p34
aVin broken-down legal systems,
p35
aVand unfortunately because torture is
p36
aVthe cheapest form of investigation \u2014
p37
aVit's cheaper than having a legal system,
p38
aVcheaper than having a lawyer
p39
aVand early access to counsel \u2014
p40
aVit is what happens most of the time.
p41
aVI believe today that it is possible for us
p42
aVas a world community, if we make a decision,
p43
aVto come together and end torture
p44
aVas an investigative tool in our lifetime,
p45
aVbut it will require three things.
p46
aVFirst is the training, empowerment,
p47
aVand connection of defenders worldwide.
p48
aa(lp49
VThe second is insuring that there is
p50
aVsystematic early access to counsel.
p51
aVAnd the third is commitment.
p52
aVSo in the year 2000,
p53
aVI began to wonder,
p54
aVwhat if we came together?
p55
aVCould we do something
p56
aVfor these 93 countries?
p57
aVAnd I founded International Bridges to Justice
p58
aVwhich has a specific mission of
p59
aVending torture as an investigative tool
p60
aVand implementing due process rights
p61
aVin the 93 countries by placing trained lawyers
p62
aVat an early stage in police stations
p63
aVand in courtrooms.
p64
aVMy first experiences, though, did come
p65
aVfrom Cambodia, and at the time I remember
p66
aVfirst coming to Cambodia and there were,
p67
aVin 1994, still less than
p68
aV10 attorneys in the country because
p69
aVthe Khmer Rouge had killed them all.
p70
aa(lp71
VAnd even 20 years later, there was only
p72
aV10 lawyers in the country, so consequently
p73
aVyou'd walk into a prison and
p74
aVnot only would you meet 12-year-old boys,
p75
aVyou'd meet women and you'd say,
p76
aV"Why are you here?" Women would say,
p77
aV"Well I've been here for 10 years because
p78
aVmy husband committed a crime, but they can't find him."
p79
aVSo it's just a place where there was no rule of law.
p80
aa(lp81
VThe first group of defenders came together
p82
aVand I still remember, as I was training, I said,
p83
aV"Okay, what do you do for an investigation?"
p84
aVAnd there was silence in the class, and finally
p85
aVone woman stood up, [inaudible name],
p86
aVand she said "Khrew," which means "teacher."
p87
aVShe said, "I have defended more than
p88
aVa hundred people, and I've never had to do
p89
aVany investigation,
p90
aVbecause they all come with confessions."
p91
aa(lp92
VAnd we talked about, as a class, the fact that
p93
aVnumber one, the confessions
p94
aVmight not be reliable, but number two,
p95
aVwe did not want to encourage the police
p96
aVto keep doing this, especially
p97
aVas it was now against the law.
p98
aVAnd it took a lot of courage for these
p99
aVdefenders to decide that they would
p100
aVbegin to stand up and support each other
p101
aVin implementing these laws.
p102
aVAnd I still remember the first cases where
p103
aVthey came, all 25 together, she would
p104
aVstand up, and they were in the back, and
p105
aVthey would support her, and the judges kept
p106
aVsaying, "No, no, no, no, we're going to do things
p107
aVthe exact same way we've been doing them."
p108
aa(lp109
VBut one day the perfect case came, and it
p110
aVwas a woman who was a vegetable seller,
p111
aVshe was sitting outside of a house.
p112
aVShe said she actually saw the person
p113
aVrun out who she thinks stole
p114
aVwhatever the jewelry was, but the police
p115
aVcame, they got her, there was nothing on her.
p116
aVShe was pregnant at the time. She had
p117
aVcigarette burns on her. She'd miscarried.
p118
aVAnd when they brought her case
p119
aVto the judge, for the first time he stood up
p120
aVand he said, "Yes, there's no evidence
p121
aVexcept for your torture confession
p122
aVand you will be released."
p123
aa(lp124
VAnd the defenders began to take cases
p125
aVover and over again and
p126
aVyou will see, they have step by step began
p127
aVto change the course of history in Cambodia.
p128
aVBut Cambodia is not alone.
p129
aVI used to think, well is it Cambodia?
p130
aVOr is it other countries?
p131
aVBut it is in so many countries.
p132
aa(lp133
VIn Burundi I walked into a prison and it wasn't
p134
aVa 12-year-old boy, it was an 8-year-old boy
p135
aVfor stealing a mobile phone.
p136
aVOr a woman, I picked up her baby,
p137
aVreally cute baby, I said "Your baby is so cute."
p138
aVIt wasn't a baby, she was three.
p139
aVAnd she said "Yeah, but she's why I'm here,"
p140
aVbecause she was accused of stealing
p141
aVtwo diapers and an iron for her baby and
p142
aVstill had been in prison.
p143
aVAnd when I walked up to the prison director,
p144
aVI said, "You've got to let her out.
p145
aVA judge would let her out."
p146
aVAnd he said, "Okay, we can talk about it,
p147
aVbut look at my prison. Eighty percent
p148
aVof the two thousand people here
p149
aVare without a lawyer. What can we do?"
p150
aVSo lawyers began to courageously
p151
aVstand up together to organize a system
p152
aVwhere they can take cases.
p153
aVBut we realized that it's not only the training
p154
aVof the lawyers, but the connection
p155
aVof the lawyers that makes a difference.
p156
aa(lp157
VFor example, in Cambodia, it was that
p158
aV[inaudible name] did not go alone
p159
aVbut she had 24 lawyers with her
p160
aVwho stood up together. And in the same way,
p161
aVin China, they always tell me,
p162
aV"It's like a fresh wind in the desert
p163
aVwhen we can come together."
p164
aVOr in Zimbabwe, where I remember Innocent,
p165
aVafter coming out of a prison where everybody
p166
aVstood up and said, "I've been here
p167
aVfor one year, eight years, 12 years
p168
aVwithout a lawyer,"
p169
aVhe came and we had a training together
p170
aVand he said, "I have heard it said" \u2014
p171
aVbecause he had heard people mumbling
p172
aVand grumbling \u2014 "I have heard it said that
p173
aVwe cannot help to create justice
p174
aVbecause we do not have the resources."
p175
aVAnd then he said, "But I want you to know
p176
aVthat the lack of resources
p177
aVis never an excuse for injustice."
p178
aVAnd with that, he successfully
p179
aVorganized 68 lawyers who have been
p180
aVsystematically taking the cases.
p181
aa(lp182
VThe key that we see, though, is training
p183
aVand then early access.
p184
aVI was recently in Egypt, and was inspired
p185
aVto meet with another group of lawyers,
p186
aVand what they told me is that they said,
p187
aV"Hey, look, we don't have police
p188
aVon the streets now. The police are
p189
aVone of the main reasons why we had
p190
aVthe revolution. They were torturing everybody
p191
aVall the time."
p192
aVAnd I said, "But there's been tens of millions
p193
aVof dollars that have recently gone in
p194
aVto the development of the legal system here.
p195
aVWhat's going on?"
p196
aVI met with one of the development agencies,
p197
aVand they were training prosecutors
p198
aVand judges, which is the normal bias,
p199
aVas opposed to defenders.
p200
aVAnd they showed me a manual which
p201
aVactually was an excellent manual.
p202
aVI said, "I'm gonna copy this."
p203
aVIt had everything in it. Lawyers can come
p204
aVat the police station. It was perfect.
p205
aVProsecutors were perfectly trained.
p206
aVBut I said to them, "I just have one question,
p207
aVwhich is, by the time that everybody got to
p208
aVthe prosecutor's office, what had happened to them?"
p209
aVAnd after a pause, they said,
p210
aV"They had been tortured."
p211
aa(lp212
VSo the pieces are,
p213
aVnot only the training of the lawyers, but
p214
aVus finding a way to systematically implement
p215
aVearly access to counsel, because they are
p216
aVthe safeguard in the system
p217
aVfor people who are being tortured.
p218
aVAnd as I tell you this, I'm also aware of the
p219
aVfact that it sounds like, "Oh, okay, it sounds
p220
aVlike we could do it, but can we really do it?"
p221
aVBecause it sounds big.
p222
aVAnd there are many reasons why I believe it's possible.
p223
aVThe first reason is the people on the ground
p224
aVwho find ways of creating miracles
p225
aVbecause of their commitment.
p226
aVIt's not only Innocent, who I told you about
p227
aVin Zimbabwe, but defenders all over the world
p228
aVwho are looking for these pieces.
p229
aVWe have a program called JusticeMakers,
p230
aVand we realized there are people that are
p231
aVcourageous and want to do things, but
p232
aVhow can we support them?
p233
aVSo it's an online contest where it's only
p234
aVfive thousand dollars if you come up with
p235
aVand innovative way of implementing justice.
p236
aVAnd there are 30 JusticeMakers
p237
aVthroughout the world, from Sri Lanka
p238
aVto Swaziland to the DRC, who with
p239
aVfive thousand dollars do amazing things,
p240
aVthrough SMS programs,
p241
aVthrough paralegal programs,
p242
aVthrough whatever they can do.
p243
aa(lp244
VAnd it's not only these JusticeMakers,
p245
aVbut people we courageously see
p246
aVfigure out who their networks are
p247
aVand how they can move it forward.
p248
aa(lp249
VSo in China, for instance, great laws
p250
aVcame out where it says police cannot
p251
aVtorture people or they will be punished.
p252
aVAnd I was sitting side by side with one of our
p253
aVvery courageous lawyers, and said,
p254
aV"How can we get this out? How can we
p255
aVmake sure that this is implemented?
p256
aVThis is fantastic." And he said to me,
p257
aV"Well, do you have money?" And I said,
p258
aV"No." And he said, "That's okay,
p259
aVwe can still figure it out."
p260
aVAnd on December 4, he organized
p261
aVthree thousand members
p262
aVof the Youth Communist League,
p263
aVfrom 14 of the top law schools,
p264
aVwho organized themselves, developed
p265
aVposters with the new laws, and went
p266
aVto the police stations and began what he says
p267
aVis a non-violent legal revolution
p268
aVto protect citizen rights.
p269
aVSo I talked about the fact that we need
p270
aVto train and support defenders.
p271
aVWe need to systematically implement
p272
aVearly access to counsel.
p273
aVBut the third and most important thing is that
p274
aVwe make a commitment to this.
p275
aa(lp276
VAnd people often say to me, "You know,
p277
aVthis is great, but it's wildly idealistic.
p278
aVNever going to happen."
p279
aVAnd the reason that I think that
p280
aVthose words are interesting is because
p281
aVthose were the same kinds of words
p282
aVthat were used for people who decided
p283
aVthey would end slavery, or end apartheid.
p284
aVIt began with a small group of people
p285
aVwho decided they would commit.
p286
aa(lp287
VNow, there's one of our favorite poems
p288
aVfrom the defenders, which they share
p289
aVfrom each other, is:
p290
aV"Take courage friends, the road is often long,
p291
aVthe path is never clear,
p292
aVand the stakes are very high,
p293
aVbut deep down, you are not alone."
p294
aVAnd I believe that if we can come together
p295
aVas a world community to support not only
p296
aVdefenders, but also everyone in the system
p297
aVwho is looking towards it,
p298
aVwe can end torture as an investigative tool.
p299
aVI end always, because I'm sure the questions are \u2014
p300
aVand I'd be happy to talk to you
p301
aVat any point \u2014 "But what can I really do?"
p302
aVWell, I would say this. First of all,
p303
aVyou know what you can do. But second of all,
p304
aVI would leave you with the story of Vishna,
p305
aVwho actually was my inspiration
p306
aVfor starting International Bridges to Justice.
p307
aa(lp308
VVishna was a 4-year-old boy when I met him
p309
aVwho was born in a Cambodian prison
p310
aVin Kandal Province. But because he was
p311
aVborn in the prison, everybody loved him,
p312
aVincluding the guards, so he was the only one
p313
aVwho was allowed to come
p314
aVin and out of the bars.
p315
aVSo, you know, there's bars. And by the time
p316
aVthat Vishna was getting bigger,
p317
aVwhich means what gets bigger? Your head gets bigger.
p318
aVSo he would come to the first bar,
p319
aVthe second bar and then the third bar,
p320
aVand then really slowly move his head
p321
aVso he could fit through, and come back,
p322
aVthird, second, first. And he would
p323
aVgrab my pinkie, because what he wanted
p324
aVto do every day is he wanted to go visit.
p325
aVYou know, he never quite made it to
p326
aVall of them every day, but he wanted to visit
p327
aVall 156 prisoners. And I would lift him,
p328
aVand he would put his fingers through.
p329
aVOr if they were dark cells, it was like iron
p330
aVcorrugated, and he would put his fingers through.
p331
aa(lp332
VAnd most of the prisoners said that he was
p333
aVtheir greatest joy and their sunshine, and they
p334
aVlooked forward to him. And I was like,
p335
aVhere's Vishna. He's a 4-year-old boy.
p336
aVHe was born in a prison with almost nothing,
p337
aVno material goods, but he had a sense of
p338
aVhis own heroic journey, which I believe
p339
aVwe are all born into. He said,
p340
aV"Probably I can't do everything.
p341
aVBut I'm one. I can do something.
p342
aVAnd I will do the one thing that I can do."
p343
aVSo I thank you for having the prophetic
p344
aVimagination to imagine the shaping
p345
aVof a new world with us together,
p346
aVand invite you into this journey with us.
p347
aa(lp348
VThank you.

p351
aa(lp352
