VI'm going to have a pretty simple idea
p4
aVthat I'm just going to tell you over and over until I get you to believe it,
p5
aVand that is all of us are makers.
p6
aVI really believe that.
p7
aVAll of us are makers.
p8
aVWe're born makers.
p9
aVWe have this ability
p10
aVto make things,
p11
aVto grasp things with our hands.
p12
aVWe use words like "grasp" metaphorically
p13
aVto also think about understanding things.
p14
aVWe don't just live, but we make.
p15
aVWe create things.
p16
aVWell I'm going to show you a group of makers
p17
aVfrom Maker Faire and various places.
p18
aVIt doesn't come out particularly well,
p19
aVbut that's a particularly tall bicycle.
p20
aVIt's a scraper bike; it's called \u2014
p21
aVfrom Oakland.
p22
aVAnd this is a particularly small scooter
p23
aVfor a gentleman of this size.
p24
aVBut he's trying to power it, or motorize it,
p25
aVwith a drill.
p26
aV(Laughter)
p27
aVAnd the question he had is,
p28
aV"Can I do it? Can it be done?"
p29
aVApparently it can.
p30
aVSo makers are enthusiasts; they're amateurs;
p31
aVthey're people who love
p32
aVdoing what they do.
p33
aVThey don't always even know why they're doing it.
p34
aa(lp35
VWe have begun organizing makers
p36
aVat our Maker Faire.
p37
aVThere was one held in Detroit here last summer,
p38
aVand it will be held again next summer, at the Henry Ford.
p39
aVBut we hold them in San Francisco \u2014
p40
aV(Applause)
p41
aV\u2014 and in New York.
p42
aVAnd it's a fabulous event
p43
aVto just meet and talk to these people who make things
p44
aVand are there to just show them to you and talk about them
p45
aVand have a great conversation.
p46
aa(lp47
V(Video) Guy: I might get one of those.
p48
aa(lp49
VDale Dougherty: These are electric muffins.
p50
aa(lp51
VGuy: Where did you guys get those?
p52
aa(lp53
VMuffin: Will you glide with us? (Guy: No.)
p54
aa(lp55
VDD: I know Ford has new electric vehicles coming out.
p56
aVWe got there first.
p57
aa(lp58
VLady: Will you glide with us?
p59
aa(lp60
VDD: This is something I call "swinging in the rain."
p61
aVAnd you can barely see it,
p62
aVbut it's \u2014 a controller at top cycles the water to fall
p63
aVjust before and after you pass through the bottom of the arc.
p64
aVSo imagine a kid: "Am I going to get wet? Am I going to get wet?
p65
aVNo, I didn't get wet. Am I going to get wet? Am I going to get wet?"
p66
aVThat's the experience of a clever ride.
p67
aVAnd of course, we have fashion.
p68
aVPeople are remaking things into fashion.
p69
aVI don't know if this is called a basket-bra,
p70
aVbut it ought to be something like that.
p71
aVWe have art students getting together,
p72
aVtaking old radiator parts
p73
aVand doing an iron-pour to make something new out of it.
p74
aVThey did that in the summer, and it was very warm.
p75
aa(lp76
VNow this one takes a little bit of explaining.
p77
aVYou know what those are, right?
p78
aVBilly-Bob, or Billy Bass, or something like that.
p79
aVNow the background is \u2014 the guy who did this is a physicist.
p80
aVAnd here he'll explain a little bit about what it does.
p81
aa(lp82
V(Video) Richard Carter: I'm Richard Carter,
p83
aVand this is the Sashimi Tabernacle Choir.
p84
aa(lp85
VChoir: \u266b When you hold me in your arms \u266b
p86
aa(lp87
VDD: This is all computer-controlled
p88
aVin an old Volvo.
p89
aa(lp90
VChoir: \u266b I'm hooked on a feelin' \u266b
p91
aV\u266b I'm high on believin' \u266b
p92
aV\u266b That you're in love with me \u266b
p93
aa(lp94
VDD: So Richard came up from Houston last year
p95
aVto visit us in Detroit here
p96
aVand show the wonderful Sashimi Tabernacle Choir.
p97
aVSo, are you a maker?
p98
aVHow many people here would say you're a maker, if you raise your hand?
p99
aVThat's a pretty good \u2014
p100
aVbut there's some of you out there that won't admit that you're makers.
p101
aVAnd again, think about it.
p102
aVYou're makers of food; you're makers of shelter;
p103
aVyou're makers of lots of different things,
p104
aVand partly what interests me today
p105
aVis you're makers of your own world,
p106
aVand particularly the role that technology has
p107
aVin your life.
p108
aVYou're really a driver or a passenger \u2014
p109
aVto use a Volkswagen phrase.
p110
aVMakers are in control.
p111
aVThat's what fascinates them. That's why they do what they do.
p112
aVThey want to figure out how things work;
p113
aVthey want to get access to it;
p114
aVand they want to control it.
p115
aVThey want to use it to their own purpose.
p116
aa(lp117
VMakers today, to some degree, are out on the edge.
p118
aVThey're not mainstream.
p119
aVThey're a little bit radical.
p120
aVThey're a bit subversive in what they do.
p121
aVBut at one time,
p122
aVit was fairly commonplace to think of yourself as a maker.
p123
aVIt was not something you'd even remark upon.
p124
aVAnd I found this old video.
p125
aVAnd I'll tell you more about it, but just ...
p126
aa(lp127
V(Music)
p128
aa(lp129
V(Video) Narrator: Of all things Americans are,
p130
aVwe are makers.
p131
aVWith our strengths and our minds and spirit,
p132
aVwe gather, we form, and we fashion.
p133
aVMakers and shapers
p134
aVand put-it-togetherers.
p135
aa(lp136
VDD: So it goes on to show you
p137
aVpeople making things out of wood,
p138
aVa grandfather making a ship in a bottle,
p139
aVa woman making a pie \u2014
p140
aVsomewhat standard fare of the day.
p141
aVBut it was a sense of pride
p142
aVthat we made things,
p143
aVthat the world around us was made by us.
p144
aVIt didn't just exist.
p145
aVWe made it, and we were connected to it that way.
p146
aVAnd I think that's tremendously important.
p147
aVNow I'm going to tell you one funny thing about this.
p148
aVThis particular reel \u2014
p149
aVit's an industrial video \u2014
p150
aVbut it was shown in drive-in theaters
p151
aVin 1961 \u2014
p152
aVin the Detroit area, in fact \u2014
p153
aVand it preceded Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho."
p154
aV(Laughter)
p155
aVSo I like to think there was something going on there
p156
aVof the new generation of makers
p157
aVcoming out of this, plus "Psycho."
p158
aa(lp159
VThis is Andrew Archer.
p160
aVI met Andrew at one of our community meetings
p161
aVputting together Maker Faire.
p162
aVAndrew had moved to Detroit
p163
aVfrom Duluth, Minnesota.
p164
aVAnd I talked to his mom,
p165
aVand I ended up doing a story on him
p166
aVfor a magazine called Kidrobot.
p167
aVHe's just a kid that grew up
p168
aVplaying with tools instead of toys.
p169
aVHe liked to take things apart.
p170
aVHis mother gave him a part of the garage,
p171
aVand he collected things from yard sales, and he made stuff.
p172
aVAnd then he didn't particularly like school that much,
p173
aVbut he got involved in robotics competitions,
p174
aVand he realized he had a talent,
p175
aVand, more importantly, he had a real passion for it.
p176
aVAnd he began building robots.
p177
aVAnd when I sat down next to him,
p178
aVhe was telling me about a company he formed,
p179
aVand he was building some robots for automobile factories
p180
aVto move things around on the factory floor.
p181
aVAnd that's why he moved to Michigan.
p182
aVBut he also moved here
p183
aVto meet other people doing what he's doing.
p184
aVAnd this kind of gets to this important idea today.
p185
aa(lp186
VThis is Jeff and Bilal and several others here
p187
aVin a hackerspace.
p188
aVAnd there's about three hackerspaces or more in Detroit.
p189
aVAnd there's probably even some new ones since I've been here last.
p190
aVBut these are like clubs \u2014
p191
aVthey're sharing tools, sharing space,
p192
aVsharing expertise in what to make.
p193
aVAnd so it's a very interesting phenomenon
p194
aVthat's going across the world.
p195
aVBut essentially these are people that are playing with technology.
p196
aVLet me say that again: playing.
p197
aVThey don't necessarily know what they're doing or why they're doing it.
p198
aVThey're playing
p199
aVto discover what the technology can do,
p200
aVand probably to discover what they can do themselves,
p201
aVwhat their own capabilities are.
p202
aa(lp203
VNow the other thing that I think is taking off,
p204
aVanother reason making is taking off today,
p205
aVis there's some great new tools out there.
p206
aVAnd you can't see this very well on the screen,
p207
aVbut Arduino \u2014 Arduino is an open-source hardware platform.
p208
aVIt's a micro-controller.
p209
aVIf you don't know what those are, they're just the "brains."
p210
aVSo they're the brains of maker projects,
p211
aVand here's an example of one.
p212
aVAnd I don't know if you can see it that well, but that's a mailbox \u2014
p213
aVso an ordinary mailbox and an Arduino.
p214
aVSo you figure out how to program this,
p215
aVand you put this in your mailbox.
p216
aVAnd when someone opens your mailbox,
p217
aVyou get a notification,
p218
aVan alert message goes to your iPhone.
p219
aVNow that could be a dog door,
p220
aVit could be someone going somewhere where they shouldn't,
p221
aVlike a little brother into a little sister's room.
p222
aVThere's all kinds of different things
p223
aVthat you can imagine for that.
p224
aa(lp225
VNow here's something \u2014 a 3D printer.
p226
aVThat's another tool that's really taken off \u2014 really, really interesting.
p227
aVThis is Makerbot.
p228
aVAnd there are industrial versions of this \u2014
p229
aVabout 20,000 dollars.
p230
aVThese guys came up with a kit version
p231
aVfor 750 dollars,
p232
aVand that means that hobbyists and ordinary folks
p233
aVcan get a hold of this and begin playing with 3D printers.
p234
aVNow they don't know what they want to do with it,
p235
aVbut they're going to figure it out.
p236
aVThey will only figure it out by getting their hands on it and playing with it.
p237
aVOne of the coolest things is, Makerbot sent out an upgrade,
p238
aVsome new brackets for the box.
p239
aVWell you printed out the brackets
p240
aVand then replaced the old brackets with the new ones.
p241
aVIsn't that cool?
p242
aa(lp243
VSo makers harvest technology
p244
aVfrom all the places around us.
p245
aVThis is a radar speed detector
p246
aVthat was developed from a Hot Wheels toy.
p247
aVAnd they do interesting things.
p248
aVThey're really creating new areas and exploring areas
p249
aVthat you might only think \u2014
p250
aVthe military is doing drones \u2014
p251
aVwell, there is a whole community of people
p252
aVbuilding autonomous airplanes, or vehicles \u2014
p253
aVsomething that you could program to fly on its own,
p254
aVwithout a stick or anything, to figure out what path it's going.
p255
aVFascinating work they're doing.
p256
aa(lp257
VWe just had an issue on space exploration,
p258
aVDIY space exploration.
p259
aVThis is probably the best time in the history of mankind
p260
aVto love space.
p261
aVYou could build your own satellite and get it into space
p262
aVfor like 8,000 dollars.
p263
aVThink how much money and how many years it took NASA
p264
aVto get satellites into space.
p265
aVIn fact, these guys actually work for NASA,
p266
aVand they're trying to pioneer using off-the-shelf components,
p267
aVcheap things that aren't specialized
p268
aVthat they can combine
p269
aVand send up into space.
p270
aa(lp271
VMakers are a source of innovation,
p272
aVand I think it relates back to something
p273
aVlike the birth of the personal computer industry.
p274
aVThis is Steve Wozniak. Where does he learn about computers?
p275
aVIt's the Homebrew Computer Club \u2014 just like a hackerspace.
p276
aVAnd he says, "I could go there all day long
p277
aVand talk to people
p278
aVand share ideas for free."
p279
aVWell he did a little bit better than free.
p280
aVBut it's important to understand
p281
aVthat a lot of the origins of our industries \u2014
p282
aVeven like Henry Ford \u2014
p283
aVcome from this idea of playing
p284
aVand figuring things out in groups.
p285
aa(lp286
VWell, if I haven't convinced you that you're a maker,
p287
aVI hope I could convince you
p288
aVthat our next generation should be makers,
p289
aVthat kids are particularly interested in this,
p290
aVin this ability to control the physical world
p291
aVand be able to use things like micro-controllers
p292
aVand build robots.
p293
aVAnd we've got to get this into schools,
p294
aVor into communities in many, many ways \u2014
p295
aVthe ability to tinker,
p296
aVto shape and reshape the world around us.
p297
aVThere's a great opportunity today \u2014
p298
aVand that's what I really care about the most.
p299
aVAn the answer to the question: what will America make?
p300
aVIt's more makers.
p301
aa(lp302
VThank you very much.
