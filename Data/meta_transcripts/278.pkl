VLast year, I told you the story, in seven minutes, of Project Orion,
p4
aVwhich was this very implausible technology
p5
aVthat technically could have worked,
p6
aVbut it had this one-year political window where it could have happened.
p7
aVSo it didn't happen. It was a dream that did not happen.
p8
aVThis year I'm going to tell you the story of the birth of digital computing.
p9
aVThis was a perfect introduction.
p10
aVAnd it's a story that did work. It did happen,
p11
aVand the machines are all around us.
p12
aVAnd it was a technology that was inevitable.
p13
aVIf the people I'm going to tell you the story about,
p14
aVif they hadn't done it, somebody else would have.
p15
aVSo, it was sort of the right idea at the right time.
p16
aa(lp17
VThis is Barricelli's universe. This is the universe we live in now.
p18
aVIt's the universe in which these machines
p19
aVare now doing all these things, including changing biology.
p20
aVI'm starting the story with the first atomic bomb at Trinity,
p21
aVwhich was the Manhattan Project. It was a little bit like TED:
p22
aVit brought a whole lot of very smart people together.
p23
aVAnd three of the smartest people were
p24
aVStan Ulam, Richard Feynman and John von Neumann.
p25
aVAnd it was Von Neumann who said, after the bomb,
p26
aVhe was working on something much more important than bombs:
p27
aVhe's thinking about computers.
p28
aVSo, he wasn't only thinking about them; he built one. This is the machine he built.
p29
aa(lp30
V(Laughter)
p31
aa(lp32
VHe built this machine,
p33
aVand we had a beautiful demonstration of how this thing really works,
p34
aVwith these little bits. And it's an idea that goes way back.
p35
aVThe first person to really explain that
p36
aVwas Thomas Hobbes, who, in 1651,
p37
aVexplained how arithmetic and logic are the same thing,
p38
aVand if you want to do artificial thinking and artificial logic,
p39
aVyou can do it all with arithmetic.
p40
aVHe said you needed addition and subtraction.
p41
aVLeibniz, who came a little bit later \u2014 this is 1679 \u2014
p42
aVshowed that you didn't even need subtraction.
p43
aVYou could do the whole thing with addition.
p44
aVHere, we have all the binary arithmetic and logic
p45
aVthat drove the computer revolution.
p46
aVAnd Leibniz was the first person to really talk about building such a machine.
p47
aVHe talked about doing it with marbles,
p48
aVhaving gates and what we now call shift registers,
p49
aVwhere you shift the gates, drop the marbles down the tracks.
p50
aVAnd that's what all these machines are doing,
p51
aVexcept, instead of doing it with marbles,
p52
aVthey're doing it with electrons.
p53
aa(lp54
VAnd then we jump to Von Neumann, 1945,
p55
aVwhen he sort of reinvents the whole same thing.
p56
aVAnd 1945, after the war, the electronics existed
p57
aVto actually try and build such a machine.
p58
aVSo June 1945 \u2014 actually, the bomb hasn't even been dropped yet \u2014
p59
aVand Von Neumann is putting together all the theory to actually build this thing,
p60
aVwhich also goes back to Turing,
p61
aVwho, before that, gave the idea that you could do all this
p62
aVwith a very brainless, little, finite state machine,
p63
aVjust reading a tape in and reading a tape out.
p64
aVThe other sort of genesis of what Von Neumann did
p65
aVwas the difficulty of how you would predict the weather.
p66
aVLewis Richardson saw how you could do this with a cellular array of people,
p67
aVgiving them each a little chunk, and putting it together.
p68
aVHere, we have an electrical model illustrating a mind having a will,
p69
aVbut capable of only two ideas.
p70
aa(lp71
V(Laughter)
p72
aa(lp73
VAnd that's really the simplest computer.
p74
aVIt's basically why you need the qubit,
p75
aVbecause it only has two ideas.
p76
aa(lp77
VAnd you put lots of those together,
p78
aVyou get the essentials of the modern computer:
p79
aVthe arithmetic unit, the central control, the memory,
p80
aVthe recording medium, the input and the output.
p81
aVBut, there's one catch. This is the fatal \u2014 you know,
p82
aVwe saw it in starting these programs up.
p83
aVThe instructions which govern this operation
p84
aVmust be given in absolutely exhaustive detail.
p85
aVSo, the programming has to be perfect, or it won't work.
p86
aa(lp87
VIf you look at the origins of this,
p88
aVthe classic history sort of takes it all back to the ENIAC here.
p89
aVBut actually, the machine I'm going to tell you about,
p90
aVthe Institute for Advanced Study machine, which is way up there,
p91
aVreally should be down there. So, I'm trying to revise history,
p92
aVand give some of these guys more credit than they've had.
p93
aVSuch a computer would open up universes,
p94
aVwhich are, at the present, outside the range of any instruments.
p95
aVSo it opens up a whole new world, and these people saw it.
p96
aVThe guy who was supposed to build this machine
p97
aVwas the guy in the middle, Vladimir Zworykin, from RCA.
p98
aVRCA, in probably one of the lousiest business decisions
p99
aVof all time, decided not to go into computers.
p100
aVBut the first meetings, November 1945, were at RCA's offices.
p101
aVRCA started this whole thing off, and said, you know,
p102
aVtelevisions are the future, not computers.
p103
aa(lp104
VThe essentials were all there \u2014
p105
aVall the things that make these machines run.
p106
aVVon Neumann, and a logician, and a mathematician from the army
p107
aVput this together. Then, they needed a place to build it.
p108
aVWhen RCA said no, that's when they decided to build it in Princeton,
p109
aVwhere Freeman works at the Institute.
p110
aVThat's where I grew up as a kid.
p111
aVThat's me, that's my sister Esther, who's talked to you before,
p112
aVso we both go back to the birth of this thing.
p113
aVThat's Freeman, a long time ago,
p114
aVand that was me.
p115
aVAnd this is Von Neumann and Morgenstern,
p116
aVwho wrote the "Theory of Games."
p117
aVAll these forces came together there, in Princeton.
p118
aVOppenheimer, who had built the bomb.
p119
aVThe machine was actually used mainly for doing bomb calculations.
p120
aVAnd Julian Bigelow, who took
p121
aVZworkykin's place as the engineer, to actually figure out, using electronics,
p122
aVhow you would build this thing. The whole gang of people who came to work on this,
p123
aVand women in front, who actually did most of the coding, were the first programmers.
p124
aVThese were the prototype geeks, the nerds.
p125
aVThey didn't fit in at the Institute.
p126
aVThis is a letter from the director, concerned about \u2014
p127
aV"especially unfair on the matter of sugar."
p128
aa(lp129
V(Laughter)
p130
aa(lp131
VYou can read the text.
p132
aa(lp133
V(Laughter)
p134
aa(lp135
VThis is hackers getting in trouble for the first time.
p136
aa(lp137
V(Laughter).
p138
aa(lp139
VThese were not theoretical physicists.
p140
aVThey were real soldering-gun type guys, and they actually built this thing.
p141
aa(lp142
VAnd we take it for granted now, that each of these machines
p143
aVhas billions of transistors, doing billions of cycles per second without failing.
p144
aVThey were using vacuum tubes, very narrow, sloppy techniques
p145
aVto get actually binary behavior out of these radio vacuum tubes.
p146
aVThey actually used 6J6, the common radio tube,
p147
aVbecause they found they were more reliable than the more expensive tubes.
p148
aVAnd what they did at the Institute was publish every step of the way.
p149
aVReports were issued, so that this machine was cloned
p150
aVat 15 other places around the world.
p151
aVAnd it really was. It was the original microprocessor.
p152
aVAll the computers now are copies of that machine.
p153
aVThe memory was in cathode ray tubes \u2014
p154
aVa whole bunch of spots on the face of the tube \u2014
p155
aVvery, very sensitive to electromagnetic disturbances.
p156
aVSo, there's 40 of these tubes,
p157
aVlike a V-40 engine running the memory.
p158
aa(lp159
V(Laughter)
p160
aa(lp161
VThe input and the output was by teletype tape at first.
p162
aVThis is a wire drive, using bicycle wheels.
p163
aVThis is the archetype of the hard disk that's in your machine now.
p164
aVThen they switched to a magnetic drum.
p165
aVThis is modifying IBM equipment,
p166
aVwhich is the origins of the whole data-processing industry, later at IBM.
p167
aVAnd this is the beginning of computer graphics.
p168
aVThe "Graph'g-Beam Turn On." This next slide,
p169
aVthat's the \u2014 as far as I know \u2014 the first digital bitmap display, 1954.
p170
aa(lp171
VSo, Von Neumann was already off in a theoretical cloud,
p172
aVdoing abstract sorts of studies of how you could build
p173
aVreliable machines out of unreliable components.
p174
aVThose guys drinking all the tea with sugar in it
p175
aVwere writing in their logbooks, trying to get this thing to work, with all
p176
aVthese 2,600 vacuum tubes that failed half the time.
p177
aVAnd that's what I've been doing, this last six months, is going through the logs.
p178
aV"Running time: two minutes. Input, output: 90 minutes."
p179
aVThis includes a large amount of human error.
p180
aVSo they are always trying to figure out, what's machine error? What's human error?
p181
aVWhat's code, what's hardware?
p182
aa(lp183
VThat's an engineer gazing at tube number 36,
p184
aVtrying to figure out why the memory's not in focus.
p185
aVHe had to focus the memory \u2014 seems OK.
p186
aVSo, he had to focus each tube just to get the memory up and running,
p187
aVlet alone having, you know, software problems.
p188
aa(lp189
V"No use, went home." (Laughter)
p190
aa(lp191
V"Impossible to follow the damn thing, where's a directory?"
p192
aa(lp193
VSo, already, they're complaining about the manuals:
p194
aV"before closing down in disgust ... "
p195
aa(lp196
V"The General Arithmetic: Operating Logs."
p197
aVBurning lots of midnight oil.
p198
aa(lp199
V"MANIAC," which became the acronym for the machine,
p200
aVMathematical and Numerical Integrator and Calculator, "lost its memory."
p201
aa(lp202
V"MANIAC regained its memory, when the power went off." "Machine or human?"
p203
aa(lp204
V"Aha!" So, they figured out it's a code problem.
p205
aa(lp206
V"Found trouble in code, I hope."
p207
aa(lp208
V"Code error, machine not guilty."
p209
aa(lp210
V"Damn it, I can be just as stubborn as this thing."
p211
aa(lp212
V(Laughter)
p213
aa(lp214
V"And the dawn came." So they ran all night.
p215
aVTwenty-four hours a day, this thing was running, mainly running bomb calculations.
p216
aa(lp217
V"Everything up to this point is wasted time." "What's the use? Good night."
p218
aa(lp219
V"Master control off. The hell with it. Way off." (Laughter)
p220
aa(lp221
V"Something's wrong with the air conditioner \u2014
p222
aVsmell of burning V-belts in the air."
p223
aa(lp224
V"A short \u2014 do not turn the machine on."
p225
aa(lp226
V"IBM machine putting a tar-like substance on the cards. The tar is from the roof."
p227
aVSo they really were working under tough conditions.
p228
aa(lp229
V(Laughter)
p230
aa(lp231
VHere, "A mouse has climbed into the blower
p232
aVbehind the regulator rack, set blower to vibrating. Result: no more mouse."
p233
aa(lp234
V(Laughter)
p235
aa(lp236
V"Here lies mouse. Born: ?. Died: 4:50 a.m., May 1953."
p237
aa(lp238
V(Laughter)
p239
aa(lp240
VThere's an inside joke someone has penciled in:
p241
aV"Here lies Marston Mouse."
p242
aVIf you're a mathematician, you get that,
p243
aVbecause Marston was a mathematician who
p244
aVobjected to the computer being there.
p245
aa(lp246
V"Picked a lightning bug off the drum." "Running at two kilocycles."
p247
aVThat's two thousand cycles per second \u2014
p248
aV"yes, I'm chicken" \u2014 so two kilocycles was slow speed.
p249
aVThe high speed was 16 kilocycles.
p250
aVI don't know if you remember a Mac that was 16 Megahertz,
p251
aVthat's slow speed.
p252
aa(lp253
V"I have now duplicated both results.
p254
aVHow will I know which is right, assuming one result is correct?
p255
aVThis now is the third different output.
p256
aVI know when I'm licked."
p257
aa(lp258
V(Laughter)
p259
aa(lp260
V"We've duplicated errors before."
p261
aa(lp262
V"Machine run, fine. Code isn't."
p263
aa(lp264
V"Only happens when the machine is running."
p265
aa(lp266
VAnd sometimes things are okay.
p267
aV"Machine a thing of beauty, and a joy forever." "Perfect running."
p268
aa(lp269
V"Parting thought: when there's bigger and better errors, we'll have them."
p270
aa(lp271
VSo, nobody was supposed to know they were actually designing bombs.
p272
aVThey're designing hydrogen bombs. But someone in the logbook,
p273
aVlate one night, finally drew a bomb.
p274
aVSo, that was the result. It was Mike,
p275
aVthe first thermonuclear bomb, in 1952.
p276
aVThat was designed on that machine,
p277
aVin the woods behind the Institute.
p278
aa(lp279
VSo Von Neumann invited a whole gang of weirdos
p280
aVfrom all over the world to work on all these problems.
p281
aVBarricelli, he came to do what we now call, really, artificial life,
p282
aVtrying to see if, in this artificial universe \u2014
p283
aVhe was a viral-geneticist, way, way, way ahead of his time.
p284
aVHe's still ahead of some of the stuff that's being done now.
p285
aVTrying to start an artificial genetic system running in the computer.
p286
aVBegan \u2014 his universe started March 3, '53.
p287
aVSo it's almost exactly \u2014 it's 50 years ago next Tuesday, I guess.
p288
aVAnd he saw everything in terms of \u2014
p289
aVhe could read the binary code straight off the machine.
p290
aVHe had a wonderful rapport.
p291
aVOther people couldn't get the machine running. It always worked for him.
p292
aVEven errors were duplicated.
p293
aa(lp294
V(Laughter)
p295
aa(lp296
V"Dr. Barricelli claims machine is wrong, code is right."
p297
aa(lp298
VSo he designed this universe, and ran it.
p299
aVWhen the bomb people went home, he was allowed in there.
p300
aVHe would run that thing all night long, running these things,
p301
aVif anybody remembers Stephen Wolfram,
p302
aVwho reinvented this stuff.
p303
aVAnd he published it. It wasn't locked up and disappeared.
p304
aVIt was published in the literature.
p305
aV"If it's that easy to create living organisms, why not create a few yourself?"
p306
aVSo, he decided to give it a try,
p307
aVto start this artificial biology going in the machines.
p308
aVAnd he found all these, sort of \u2014
p309
aVit was like a naturalist coming in
p310
aVand looking at this tiny, 5,000-byte universe,
p311
aVand seeing all these things happening
p312
aVthat we see in the outside world, in biology.
p313
aVThis is some of the generations of his universe.
p314
aVBut they're just going to stay numbers;
p315
aVthey're not going to become organisms.
p316
aVThey have to have something.
p317
aVYou have a genotype and you have to have a phenotype.
p318
aVThey have to go out and do something. And he started doing that,
p319
aVstarted giving these little numerical organisms things they could play with \u2014
p320
aVplaying chess with other machines and so on.
p321
aVAnd they did start to evolve.
p322
aVAnd he went around the country after that.
p323
aVEvery time there was a new, fast machine, he started using it,
p324
aVand saw exactly what's happening now.
p325
aVThat the programs, instead of being turned off \u2014 when you quit the program,
p326
aVyou'd keep running
p327
aVand, basically, all the sorts of things like Windows is doing,
p328
aVrunning as a multi-cellular organism on many machines,
p329
aVhe envisioned all that happening.
p330
aVAnd he saw that evolution itself was an intelligent process.
p331
aVIt wasn't any sort of creator intelligence,
p332
aVbut the thing itself was a giant parallel computation
p333
aVthat would have some intelligence.
p334
aVAnd he went out of his way to say
p335
aVthat he was not saying this was lifelike,
p336
aVor a new kind of life.
p337
aVIt just was another version of the same thing happening.
p338
aVAnd there's really no difference between what he was doing in the computer
p339
aVand what nature did billions of years ago.
p340
aVAnd could you do it again now?
p341
aa(lp342
VSo, when I went into these archives looking at this stuff, lo and behold,
p343
aVthe archivist came up one day, saying,
p344
aV"I think we found another box that had been thrown out."
p345
aVAnd it was his universe on punch cards.
p346
aVSo there it is, 50 years later, sitting there \u2014 sort of suspended animation.
p347
aVThat's the instructions for running \u2014
p348
aVthis is actually the source code
p349
aVfor one of those universes,
p350
aVwith a note from the engineers
p351
aVsaying they're having some problems.
p352
aV"There must be something about this code that you haven't explained yet."
p353
aVAnd I think that's really the truth. We still don't understand
p354
aVhow these very simple instructions can lead to increasing complexity.
p355
aVWhat's the dividing line between
p356
aVwhen that is lifelike and when it really is alive?
p357
aVThese cards, now, thanks to me showing up, are being saved.
p358
aVAnd the question is, should we run them or not?
p359
aVYou know, could we get them running?
p360
aVDo you want to let it loose on the Internet?
p361
aVThese machines would think they \u2014
p362
aVthese organisms, if they came back to life now \u2014
p363
aVwhether they've died and gone to heaven, there's a universe.
p364
aVMy laptop is 10 thousand million times
p365
aVthe size of the universe that they lived in when Barricelli quit the project.
p366
aa(lp367
VHe was thinking far ahead, to
p368
aVhow this would really grow into a new kind of life.
p369
aVAnd that's what's happening!
p370
aVWhen Juan Enriquez told us about
p371
aVthese 12 trillion bits being transferred back and forth,
p372
aVof all this genomics data going to the proteomics lab,
p373
aVthat's what Barricelli imagined:
p374
aVthat this digital code in these machines
p375
aVis actually starting to code \u2014
p376
aVit already is coding from nucleic acids.
p377
aVWe've been doing that since, you know, since we started PCR
p378
aVand synthesizing small strings of DNA.
p379
aVAnd real soon, we're actually going to be synthesizing the proteins,
p380
aVand, like Steve showed us, that just opens an entirely new world.
p381
aa(lp382
VIt's a world that Von Neumann himself envisioned.
p383
aVThis was published after he died: his sort of unfinished notes
p384
aVon self-reproducing machines,
p385
aVwhat it takes to get the machines sort of jump-started
p386
aVto where they begin to reproduce.
p387
aVIt took really three people:
p388
aVBarricelli had the concept of the code as a living thing;
p389
aVVon Neumann saw how you could build the machines \u2014
p390
aVthat now, last count, four million
p391
aVof these Von Neumann machines is built every 24 hours;
p392
aVand Julian Bigelow, who died 10 days ago \u2014
p393
aVthis is John Markoff's obituary for him \u2014
p394
aVhe was the important missing link,
p395
aVthe engineer who came in
p396
aVand knew how to put those vacuum tubes together and make it work.
p397
aVAnd all our computers have, inside them,
p398
aVthe copies of the architecture that he had to just design
p399
aVone day, sort of on pencil and paper.
p400
aVAnd we owe a tremendous credit to that.
p401
aVAnd he explained, in a very generous way,
p402
aVthe spirit that brought all these different people to
p403
aVthe Institute for Advanced Study in the '40s to do this project,
p404
aVand make it freely available with no patents, no restrictions,
p405
aVno intellectual property disputes to the rest of the world.
p406
aa(lp407
VThat's the last entry in the logbook
p408
aVwhen the machine was shut down, July 1958.
p409
aVAnd it's Julian Bigelow who was running it until midnight
p410
aVwhen the machine was officially turned off.
p411
aVAnd that's the end.
