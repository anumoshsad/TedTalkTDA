VI came here to show you
p4
aVthe Fotokite.
p5
aVIt's a tethered, flying camera.
p6
aVBut before I do that, I want to tell you a bit about
p7
aVwhere it came from, what motivated it.
p8
aa(lp9
VSo I was born in Russia,
p10
aVand three years ago, in 2011,
p11
aVthere were the Russian federal elections.
p12
aVThere were massive irregularities reported,
p13
aVand people came out to protest,
p14
aVwhich was very unlikely for Russia.
p15
aVAnd no one really knew
p16
aVhow significant these protests were,
p17
aVbecause, for whatever reason,
p18
aVthe world media largely ignored it.
p19
aVNow, there was a group of photographers
p20
aVwho kind of flew flying cameras as a hobby \u2014
p21
aVusually photographing things like the Sphinx,
p22
aVthe Pyramids \u2014 who happened to be
p23
aVright around the corner, and they flew a camera
p24
aVand they took some snapshots,
p25
aVsome panoramas of this demonstration.
p26
aVJust completely independent entity,
p27
aVcompletely random occurrence,
p28
aVand the image, when I saw it, it really struck me.
p29
aVHere's one of the panoramas.
p30
aVSo in a single image,
p31
aVyou can really see the scale of this event \u2014
p32
aVjust the number of people,
p33
aVthe colors, the banners.
p34
aVYou just can't consider this insignificant.
p35
aVAll in a single image, which was really cool to me.
p36
aa(lp37
VAnd I think, in the future,
p38
aVjournalism and many other professions,
p39
aVthere are flying cameras already quite commonly out there,
p40
aVbut I think, you wait a few months, a few years,
p41
aVand for many professions, it's really going to be
p42
aVa requirement.
p43
aa(lp44
VAnd it make sense. It's  such a unique perspective.
p45
aVNothing really communicates  this scale, for example,
p46
aVin context, in a way that this does.
p47
aVBut there are a few hurdles,  and they are quite basic
p48
aVand quite fundamental.
p49
aa(lp50
VOne is piloting.
p51
aVSo for this image, they flew a camera,
p52
aVa five kilogram device with an SLR under it.
p53
aVIt's quite heavy, lots of  spinning, sharp things.
p54
aVIt's a bit uncomfortable to fly,
p55
aVprobably also for the operator.
p56
aVIn fact, you can see that on the  back of the pilot's shirt, it says,
p57
aV"No questions until landing"
p58
aVin Russian and in English,
p59
aVbecause people are curious, and they'll go tap you,
p60
aVand then you lose your focus and things happen.
p61
aVAnd these guys are great. They're professionals;
p62
aVthey're really careful in what they do.
p63
aVSo in the protests, maybe you noticed,
p64
aVthey flew over the river so it was quite safe.
p65
aVBut this doesn't necessarily apply to
p66
aVall people and all conditions,
p67
aVso we really have to make piloting easier.
p68
aa(lp69
VThe other problem is regulations,
p70
aVor rather, the lack of good regulation.
p71
aVFor many good reasons, it's just difficult
p72
aVto come up with common sense laws
p73
aVto regulate flying cameras.
p74
aVSo we already have cameras.
p75
aVEveryone here, I'm sure, has a smartphone with a camera, right?
p76
aVThere are more and more of them.
p77
aVYou hear about people with Google Glass being attacked.
p78
aVYou hear about, actually, a drone pilot,
p79
aVa hobbyist, was attacked two weeks ago
p80
aVbecause he was flying near a beach.
p81
aVHere's some personal input I didn't expect.
p82
aVJust yesterday, I was attacked by a guy
p83
aVwho claimed that I was filming him.
p84
aVI was checking my email right here \u2014
p85
aVeasy way to get input for your talk.
p86
aVBut I think there are better solutions.
p87
aVI think we have to defuse the situation.
p88
aVWe have to come up with responsible solutions
p89
aVthat address the privacy issues
p90
aVand the safety, accountability issues
p91
aVbut still give us that perspective.
p92
aa(lp93
VAnd this is one potential solution.
p94
aVSo this is the Fotokite.
p95
aVWell, let me see, it's a quadrocopter,
p96
aVbut what's kind of special  about it is there's a leash.
p97
aVIt's literally a dog leash. It's very convenient.
p98
aVAnd the neat thing about it is,
p99
aVto fly it, there's no joysticks, nothing like this.
p100
aVYou just turn it on
p101
aVand you point in the direction that you want to fly.
p102
aVYou give it a little twist.
p103
aVThat's kind of the way you communicate.
p104
aVAnd there it goes.
p105
aa(lp106
V(Applause)
p107
aa(lp108
VSo the interaction is super simple.
p109
aVIt's like a personal flying pet.
p110
aVIt just always maintains a certain angle to you,
p111
aVand if I move around with it,
p112
aVit'll actually follow me naturally.
p113
aVAnd of course, we can build on top of this.
p114
aVSo this leash has some additional electronics.
p115
aVYou can turn it on.
p116
aVAnd now, it's like telling your dog to fly lower,
p117
aVif you have such a dog. So, I can press a button
p118
aVand manipulate it rather easily.
p119
aVSo I just shifted its position.
p120
aa(lp121
VAnd it's really safe.
p122
aVI don't know about you guys in the front row \u2014
p123
aV(Laughter) \u2014 but at least in principle,
p124
aVyou have to agree that you feel safer
p125
aVbecause there is a physical connection.
p126
aVLive demos are hard, right?
p127
aVThings go wrong all the time.
p128
aVBut no matter what,
p129
aVthis thing will actually prevent this thing
p130
aVfrom going into you.
p131
aVWhat's more, it tells you immediately that
p132
aVI am the one responsible for this device.
p133
aVYou don't have to look for someone controlling it.
p134
aa(lp135
VNow, I can tell you that it's easy a lot,
p136
aVbut I think a really good way to prove that
p137
aVis to grab a second one
p138
aVand launch it.
p139
aVAnd if I can do this on stage live,
p140
aVthen I can show each and every one of you
p141
aVin five minutes how to  operate one of these devices.
p142
aa(lp143
VSo now we have two eyes in the sky. (Applause)
p144
aVAnd now the trick is getting them back.
p145
aV(Laughter)
p146
aa(lp147
VSo my question now to you is,
p148
aVwell, it's a nice solution,
p149
aVit's very accessible, it's safe.
p150
aVWhat would you use it for?
p151
aVWhat would you use such a camera for in your life?
p152
aa(lp153
VThank you.
