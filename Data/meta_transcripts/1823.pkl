VEric Berlow: I'm an ecologist, and Sean's a physicist,
p4
aVand we both study complex networks.
p5
aVAnd we met a couple years ago when we discovered
p6
aVthat we had both given a short TED Talk
p7
aVabout the ecology of war,
p8
aVand we realized that we were connected
p9
aVby the ideas we shared before we ever met.
p10
aVAnd then we thought, you know, there are thousands
p11
aVof other talks out there, especially TEDx Talks,
p12
aVthat are popping up all over the world.
p13
aVHow are they connected,
p14
aVand what does that global conversation look like?
p15
aVSo Sean's going to tell you a little bit about how we did that.
p16
aa(lp17
VSean Gourley: Exactly. So we took 24,000 TEDx Talks
p18
aVfrom around the world, 147 different countries,
p19
aVand we took these talks and we wanted to find
p20
aVthe mathematical structures that underly
p21
aVthe ideas behind them.
p22
aVAnd we wanted to do that so we could see how
p23
aVthey connected with each other.
p24
aa(lp25
VAnd so, of course, if you're going to do this kind of stuff,
p26
aVyou need a lot of data.
p27
aVSo the data that you've got is a great thing called YouTube,
p28
aVand we can go down and basically pull
p29
aVall the open information from YouTube,
p30
aVall the comments, all the views, who's watching it,
p31
aVwhere are they watching it, what are they saying in the comments.
p32
aVBut we can also pull up, using speech-to-text translation,
p33
aVwe can pull the entire transcript,
p34
aVand that works even for people with kind of funny accents like myself.
p35
aVSo we can take their transcript
p36
aVand actually do some pretty cool things.
p37
aVWe can take natural language processing algorithms
p38
aVto kind of read through with a computer, line by line,
p39
aVextracting key concepts from this.
p40
aVAnd we take those key concepts and they sort of form
p41
aVthis mathematical structure of an idea.
p42
aVAnd we call that the meme-ome.
p43
aVAnd the meme-ome, you know, quite simply,
p44
aVis the mathematics that underlies an idea,
p45
aVand we can do some pretty interesting analysis with it,
p46
aVwhich I want to share with you now.
p47
aa(lp48
VSo each idea has its own meme-ome,
p49
aVand each idea is unique with that,
p50
aVbut of course, ideas, they borrow from each other,
p51
aVthey kind of steal sometimes,
p52
aVand they certainly build on each other,
p53
aVand we can go through mathematically
p54
aVand take the meme-ome from one talk
p55
aVand compare it to the meme-ome from every other talk,
p56
aVand if there's a similarity between the two of them,
p57
aVwe can create a link and represent that as a graph,
p58
aVjust like Eric and I are connected.
p59
aa(lp60
VSo that's theory, that's great.
p61
aVLet's see how it works in actual practice.
p62
aVSo what we've got here now is the global footprint
p63
aVof all the TEDx Talks over the last four years
p64
aVexploding out around the world
p65
aVfrom New York all the way down to little old New Zealand in the corner.
p66
aVAnd what we did on this is we analyzed the top 25 percent of these,
p67
aVand we started to see where the connections occurred,
p68
aVwhere they connected with each other.
p69
aVCameron Russell talking about image and beauty
p70
aVconnected over into Europe.
p71
aVWe've got a bigger conversation about Israel and Palestine
p72
aVradiating outwards from the Middle East.
p73
aVAnd we've got something a little broader
p74
aVlike big data with a truly global footprint
p75
aVreminiscent of a conversation
p76
aVthat is happening everywhere.
p77
aa(lp78
VSo from this, we kind of run up against the limits
p79
aVof what we can actually do with a geographic projection,
p80
aVbut luckily, computer technology allows us to go out
p81
aVinto multidimensional space.
p82
aVSo we can take in our network projection
p83
aVand apply a physics engine to this,
p84
aVand the similar talks kind of smash together,
p85
aVand the different ones fly apart,
p86
aVand what we're left with is something quite beautiful.
p87
aa(lp88
VEB: So I want to just point out here that every node is a talk,
p89
aVthey're linked if they share similar ideas,
p90
aVand that comes from a machine reading
p91
aVof entire talk transcripts,
p92
aVand then all these topics that pop out,
p93
aVthey're not from tags and keywords.
p94
aVThey come from the network structure
p95
aVof interconnected ideas. Keep going.
p96
aa(lp97
VSG: Absolutely. So I got a little quick on that,
p98
aVbut he's going to slow me down.
p99
aVWe've got education connected to storytelling
p100
aVtriangulated next to social media.
p101
aVYou've got, of course, the human brain right next to healthcare,
p102
aVwhich you might expect,
p103
aVbut also you've got video games, which is sort of adjacent,
p104
aVas those two spaces interface with each other.
p105
aa(lp106
VBut I want to take you into one cluster
p107
aVthat's particularly important to me, and that's the environment.
p108
aVAnd I want to kind of zoom in on that
p109
aVand see if we can get a little more resolution.
p110
aVSo as we go in here, what we start to see,
p111
aVapply the physics engine again,
p112
aVwe see what's one conversation
p113
aVis actually composed of many smaller ones.
p114
aVThe structure starts to emerge
p115
aVwhere we see a kind of fractal behavior
p116
aVof the words and the language that we use
p117
aVto describe the things that are important to us
p118
aVall around this world.
p119
aVSo you've got food economy and local food at the top,
p120
aVyou've got greenhouse gases, solar and nuclear waste.
p121
aVWhat you're getting is a range of smaller conversations,
p122
aVeach connected to each other through the ideas
p123
aVand the language they share,
p124
aVcreating a broader concept of the environment.
p125
aVAnd of course, from here, we can go
p126
aVand zoom in and see, well, what are young people looking at?
p127
aVAnd they're looking at energy technology and nuclear fusion.
p128
aVThis is their kind of resonance
p129
aVfor the conversation around the environment.
p130
aVIf we split along gender lines,
p131
aVwe can see females resonating heavily
p132
aVwith food economy, but also out there in hope and optimism.
p133
aa(lp134
VAnd so there's a lot of exciting stuff we can do here,
p135
aVand I'll throw to Eric for the next part.
p136
aa(lp137
VEB: Yeah, I mean, just to point out here,
p138
aVyou cannot get this kind of perspective
p139
aVfrom a simple tag search on YouTube.
p140
aVLet's now zoom back out to the entire global conversation
p141
aVout of environment, and look at all the talks together.
p142
aVNow often, when we're faced with this amount of content,
p143
aVwe do a couple of things to simplify it.
p144
aVWe might just say, well,
p145
aVwhat are the most popular talks out there?
p146
aVAnd a few rise to the surface.
p147
aVThere's a talk about gratitude.
p148
aVThere's another one about personal health and nutrition.
p149
aVAnd of course, there's got to be one about porn, right?
p150
aVAnd so then we might say, well, gratitude, that was last year.
p151
aVWhat's trending now? What's the popular talk now?
p152
aVAnd we can see that the new, emerging, top trending topic
p153
aVis about digital privacy.
p154
aa(lp155
VSo this is great. It simplifies things.
p156
aVBut there's so much creative content
p157
aVthat's just buried at the bottom.
p158
aVAnd I hate that. How do we bubble stuff up to the surface
p159
aVthat's maybe really creative and interesting?
p160
aVWell, we can go back to the network structure of ideas
p161
aVto do that.
p162
aVRemember, it's that network structure
p163
aVthat is creating these emergent topics,
p164
aVand let's say we could take two of them,
p165
aVlike cities and genetics, and say, well, are there any talks
p166
aVthat creatively bridge these two really different disciplines.
p167
aVAnd that's \u2014 Essentially, this kind of creative remix
p168
aVis one of the hallmarks of innovation.
p169
aVWell here's one by Jessica Green
p170
aVabout the microbial ecology of buildings.
p171
aVIt's literally defining a new field.
p172
aVAnd we could go back to those topics and say, well,
p173
aVwhat talks are central to those conversations?
p174
aVIn the cities cluster, one of the most central
p175
aVwas one by Mitch Joachim about ecological cities,
p176
aVand in the genetics cluster,
p177
aVwe have a talk about synthetic biology by Craig Venter.
p178
aVThese are talks that are linking many talks within their discipline.
p179
aVWe could go the other direction and say, well,
p180
aVwhat are talks that are broadly synthesizing
p181
aVa lot of different kinds of fields.
p182
aVWe used a measure of ecological diversity to get this.
p183
aVLike, a talk by Steven Pinker on the history of violence,
p184
aVvery synthetic.
p185
aa(lp186
VAnd then, of course, there are talks that are so unique
p187
aVthey're kind of out in the stratosphere, in their own special place,
p188
aVand we call that the Colleen Flanagan index.
p189
aVAnd if you don't know Colleen, she's an artist,
p190
aVand I asked her, "Well, what's it like out there
p191
aVin the stratosphere of our idea space?"
p192
aVAnd apparently it smells like bacon.
p193
aVI wouldn't know.
p194
aVSo we're using these network motifs
p195
aVto find talks that are unique,
p196
aVones that are creatively synthesizing a lot of different fields,
p197
aVones that are central to their topic,
p198
aVand ones that are really creatively bridging disparate fields.
p199
aVOkay? We never would have found those with our obsession
p200
aVwith what's trending now.
p201
aVAnd all of this comes from the architecture of complexity,
p202
aVor the patterns of how things are connected.
p203
aa(lp204
VSG: So that's exactly right.
p205
aVWe've got ourselves in a world
p206
aVthat's massively complex,
p207
aVand we've been using algorithms to kind of filter it down
p208
aVso we can navigate through it.
p209
aVAnd those algorithms, whilst being kind of useful,
p210
aVare also very, very narrow, and we can do better than that,
p211
aVbecause we can realize that their complexity is not random.
p212
aVIt has mathematical structure,
p213
aVand we can use that mathematical structure
p214
aVto go and explore things like the world of ideas
p215
aVto see what's being said, to see what's not being said,
p216
aVand to be a little bit more human
p217
aVand, hopefully, a little smarter.
