VYou know, we're going to do things a little differently.
p4
aVI'm not going to show you a presentation. I'm going to talk to you.
p5
aVAnd at the same time, we're going to look at just images
p6
aVfrom a photo stream that is pretty close to live of things that \u2014
p7
aVsnapshots from Second Life. So hopefully this will be fascinating.
p8
aVYou can \u2014 I can compete for your attention with the strange pictures
p9
aVthat you see on screen that come from there.
p10
aVI thought I'd talk a little bit about some just big ideas about this,
p11
aVand then get John back out here so we can talk interactively
p12
aVa little bit more and think and ask questions.
p13
aVYou know, I guess the first question is,
p14
aVwhy build a virtual world at all?
p15
aVAnd I think the answer to that is always going to be
p16
aVat least driven to a certain extent by the people
p17
aVinitially crazy enough to start the project, you know.
p18
aa(lp19
VSo I can give you a little bit of first background just on me
p20
aVand what moved me as a \u2014 really going back as far as a teenager
p21
aVand then an adult, to actually try and build this kind of thing.
p22
aVI was a very creative kid who read a lot, and got into electronics first,
p23
aVand then later, programming computers, when I was really young.
p24
aVI was just always trying to make things.
p25
aVI was just obsessed with taking things apart and building things,
p26
aVand just anything I could do with my hands or with wood
p27
aVor electronics or metal or anything else.
p28
aVAnd so, for example \u2014 and it's a great Second Life thing \u2014 I had a bedroom.
p29
aVAnd every kid, you know, as a teenager, has got his bedroom he retreats to \u2014
p30
aVbut I wanted my door, I thought it would be cool if my door went up
p31
aVrather than opened, like on Star Trek.
p32
aVI thought it would be neat to do that. And so I got up in the ceiling
p33
aVand I cut through the ceiling joists, much to my parents' delight,
p34
aVand put the door, you know, being pulled up through the ceiling.
p35
aa(lp36
VI built \u2014 I put a garage-door opener up in the attic
p37
aVthat would pull this door up.
p38
aVYou can imagine the amount of time that it took me to do this to the house
p39
aVand the displeasure of my parents.
p40
aVThe thing that was always striking to me was that we as people
p41
aVcould have so many really amazing ideas about things we'd like to do,
p42
aVbut are so often unable, in the real world, to actually do those things \u2014
p43
aVto actually cobble together the materials
p44
aVand go through the actual execution phase of building something
p45
aVthat you imagine from a design perspective.
p46
aVAnd so for me, I know that when the Internet came around
p47
aVand I was doing computer programming and just, you know,
p48
aVjust generally trying to run my own little company
p49
aVand figure out what to do with the Internet and with computers,
p50
aVI was just immediately struck by how the ultimate thing
p51
aVthat you would really want to do with the Internet and with computers
p52
aVwould be to use the Internet and connected computers
p53
aVto simulate a world to sort of recreate the laws of physics
p54
aVand the rules of how things went together \u2014
p55
aVthe sort of \u2014 the idea of atoms and how to make things,
p56
aVand do that inside a computer so that we could all get in there and make stuff.
p57
aa(lp58
VAnd so for me that was the thing that was so enticing.
p59
aVI just wanted this place where you could build things.
p60
aVAnd so I think you see that in the genesis
p61
aVof what has happened with Second Life, and I think it's important.
p62
aVI also think that more generally, the use of the Internet and technology
p63
aVas a kind of a space between us for creativity and design is a general trend.
p64
aVIt is a \u2014 sort of a great human progress.
p65
aVTechnology is just generally being used to allow us to create
p66
aVin as shared and social a way as possible.
p67
aVAnd I think that Second Life and virtual worlds more generally
p68
aVrepresent the best we can do to achieve that right now.
p69
aVYou know, another way to look at that,
p70
aVand related to the content and, you know, thinking about space,
p71
aVis to connect sort of virtual worlds to space.
p72
aVI thought that might be a fun thing to talk about for a second.
p73
aVIf you think about going into space, it's a fascinating thing.
p74
aVSo many movies, so many kids, we all sort of
p75
aVdream about exploring space. Now, why is that?
p76
aVStop for a moment and ask, why that conceit?
p77
aVWhy do we as people want to do that?
p78
aVI think there's a couple of things. It's what we see in the movies \u2014
p79
aVyou know, it's this dream that we all share.
p80
aa(lp81
VOne is that if you went into space you'd be able to begin again.
p82
aVIn some sense, you would become someone else in that journey,
p83
aVbecause there wouldn't be \u2014 you'd leave society and life as you know it, behind.
p84
aVAnd so inevitably, you would transform yourself \u2014
p85
aVirreversibly, in all likelihood \u2014 as you began this exploration.
p86
aVAnd then the second thing is that there's this tangible sense
p87
aVthat if you travel far enough, you can find out there \u2014
p88
aVoh, yeah \u2014 you have no idea what you're going to find
p89
aVonce you get there, into space.
p90
aVIt's going to be different than here.
p91
aVAnd in fact, it's going to be so different than what we see here on earth
p92
aVthat anything is going to be possible.
p93
aVSo that's kind of the idea \u2014 we as humans crave the idea of
p94
aVcreating a new identity and going into a place where anything is possible.
p95
aVAnd I think that if you really sit and think about it,
p96
aVvirtual worlds, and where we're going
p97
aVwith more and more computing technology,
p98
aVrepresent essentially the likely, really tactically possible
p99
aVversion of space exploration.
p100
aVWe are moved by the idea of virtual worlds because, like space,
p101
aVthey allow us to reinvent ourselves and they contain anything
p102
aVand everything, and probably anything could happen there.
p103
aa(lp104
VYou know, to give you a size idea about scale, you know,
p105
aVcomparing space to Second Life, most people don't realize, kind of \u2014
p106
aVand then this is just like the Internet in the early '90s.
p107
aVIn fact, Second Life virtual worlds are a lot like the Internet in the early '90s today:
p108
aVeverybody's very excited,
p109
aVthere's a lot of hype and excitement about one idea or the next
p110
aVfrom moment to moment, and then there's despair
p111
aVand everybody thinks the whole thing's not going to work.
p112
aVEverything that's happening with Second Life
p113
aVand more broadly with virtual worlds, all happened in the early '90s.
p114
aVWe always play a game at the office where you can take any article
p115
aVand find the same article where you just replace the words "Second Life"
p116
aVwith "Web," and "virtual reality" with "Internet."
p117
aVYou can find exactly the same articles
p118
aVwritten about everything that people are observing.
p119
aVTo give you an idea of scale, Second Life is about 20,000 CPUs at this point.
p120
aVIt's about 20,000 computers connected together
p121
aVin three facilities in the United States right now,
p122
aVthat are simulating this virtual space. And the virtual space itself \u2014
p123
aVthere's about 250,000 people a day that are wandering around in there,
p124
aVso the kind of, active population is something like a smallish city.
p125
aVThe space itself is about 10 times the size of San Francisco,
p126
aVand it's about as densely built out.
p127
aa(lp128
VSo it gives you an idea of scale. Now, it's expanding very rapidly \u2014
p129
aVabout five percent a month or so right now, in terms of new servers being added.
p130
aVAnd so of course, radically unlike the real world,
p131
aVand like the Internet, the whole thing is expanding
p132
aVvery, very quickly, and historically exponentially.
p133
aVSo that sort of space exploration thing is matched up here
p134
aVby the amount of content that's in there,
p135
aVand I think that amount is critical.
p136
aVIt was critical with the virtual world
p137
aVthat it be this space of truly infinite possibility.
p138
aVWe're very sensitive to that as humans.
p139
aVYou know, you know when you see it. You know when you can do anything in a space
p140
aVand you know when you can't.
p141
aVSecond Life today is this 20,000 machines,
p142
aVand it's about 100 million or so user-created objects where, you know,
p143
aVan object would be something like this, possibly interactive.
p144
aVTens of millions of them are thinking all the time;
p145
aVthey have code attached to them.
p146
aVSo it's a really large world already, in terms of the amount of stuff that's there
p147
aVand that's very important.
p148
aVIf anybody plays, like, World of Warcraft,
p149
aVWorld of Warcraft comes on, like, four DVDs.
p150
aVSecond Life, by comparison, has about 100 terabytes
p151
aVof user-created data, making it about 25,000 times larger.
p152
aa(lp153
VSo again, like the Internet compared to AOL,
p154
aVand the sort of chat rooms and content on AOL at the time,
p155
aVwhat's happening here is something very different,
p156
aVbecause the sheer scale of what people can do
p157
aVwhen they're enabled to do anything they want is pretty amazing.
p158
aVThe last big thought is that it is almost certainly true
p159
aVthat whatever this is going to evolve into
p160
aVis going to be bigger in total usage than the Web itself.
p161
aVAnd let me justify that with two statements.
p162
aVGenerically, what we use the Web for is to organize, exchange,
p163
aVcreate and consume information.
p164
aVIt's kind of like Irene talking about Google being data-driven.
p165
aVI'd say I kind of think about the world as being information.
p166
aVEverything that we interact with, all the experiences that we have,
p167
aVis kind of us flowing through a sea of information
p168
aVand interacting with it in different ways.
p169
aVThe Web puts information in the form of text and images.
p170
aVThe topology, the geography of the Web is text-to-text links for the most part.
p171
aVThat's one way of organizing information,
p172
aVbut there are two things about the way you access information in a virtual world
p173
aVthat I think are the important ways that they're very different
p174
aVand much better than what we've been able to do to date with the Web.
p175
aa(lp176
VThe first is that, as I said, the \u2014
p177
aVwell, the first difference for virtual worlds is that
p178
aVinformation is presented to you in the virtual world
p179
aVusing the most powerful iconic symbols
p180
aVthat you can possibly use with human beings.
p181
aVSo for example, C-H-A-I-R is the English word for that,
p182
aVbut a picture of this is a universal symbol.
p183
aVEverybody knows what it means. There's no need to translate it.
p184
aVIt's also more memorable if I show you that picture,
p185
aVand I show you C-H-A-I-R on a piece of paper.
p186
aVYou can do tests that show that you'll remember
p187
aVthat I was talking about a chair a couple of days later a lot better.
p188
aVSo when you organize information using the symbols of our memory,
p189
aVusing the most common symbols that we've been immersed in all our lives,
p190
aVyou maximally both excite, stimulate,
p191
aVare able to remember, transfer and manipulate data.
p192
aVAnd so virtual worlds are the best way
p193
aVfor us to essentially organize and experience information.
p194
aa(lp195
VAnd I think that's something that people have talked about for 20 years \u2014
p196
aVyou know, that 3D, that lifelike environments
p197
aVare really important in some magical way to us.
p198
aVBut the second thing \u2014 and I think this one is less obvious \u2014
p199
aVis that the experience of creating, consuming, exploring that information
p200
aVis in the virtual world implicitly and inherently social.
p201
aVYou are always there with other people.
p202
aVAnd we as humans are social creatures and must, or are aided by,
p203
aVor enjoy more, the consumption of information in the presence of others.
p204
aVIt's essential to us. You can't escape it.
p205
aVWhen you're on Amazon.com and you're looking for digital cameras or whatever,
p206
aVyou're on there right now, when you're on the site, with like 5,000 other people,
p207
aVbut you can't talk to them.
p208
aVYou can't just turn to the people that are browsing digital cameras
p209
aVon the same page as you, and ask them,
p210
aV"Hey, have you seen one of these before? Because I'm thinking about buying it."
p211
aa(lp212
VThat experience of like, shopping together, just as a simple example,
p213
aVis an example of how as social creatures
p214
aVwe want to experience information in that way.
p215
aVSo that second point, that we inherently experience information together
p216
aVor want to experience it together,
p217
aVis critical to essentially, kind of,
p218
aVthis trend of where we're going to use technology to connect us.
p219
aVAnd so I think, again, that it's likely that in the next decade or so
p220
aVthese virtual worlds are going to be the most common way as human beings
p221
aVthat we kind of use the electronics of the Internet, if you will,
p222
aVto be together, to consume information.
p223
aVYou know, mapping in India \u2014 that's such a great example.
p224
aVMaybe the solution there involves talking to other people in real time.
p225
aVAsking for advice, rather than any possible way
p226
aVthat you could just statically organize a map.
p227
aa(lp228
VSo I think that's another big point.
p229
aVI think that wherever this is all going,
p230
aVwhether it's Second Life or its descendants, or something broader
p231
aVthat happens all around the world at a lot of different points \u2014
p232
aVthis is what we're going to see the Internet used for,
p233
aVand total traffic and total unique users is going to invert,
p234
aVso that the Web and its bibliographic set of text and graphical information
p235
aVis going to become a tool or a part of that consumption pattern,
p236
aVbut the pattern itself is going to happen mostly in this type of an environment.
p237
aVBig idea, but I think highly defensible.
p238
aVSo let me stop there and bring John back,
p239
aVand maybe we can just have a longer conversation.
p240
aVThank you. John. That's great.
p241
aa(lp242
V(Applause)
p243
aa(lp244
VJohn Hockenberry: Why is the creation, the impulse to create Second Life,
p245
aVnot a utopian impulse?
p246
aVLike for example, in the 19th century,
p247
aVany number of works of literature that imagined alternative worlds
p248
aVwere explicitly utopian.
p249
aa(lp250
VPhilip Rosedale: I think that's great. That's such a deep question. Yeah.
p251
aVIs a virtual world likely to be a utopia, would be one way I'd say it.
p252
aVThe answer is no, and I think the reason why is because
p253
aVthe Web itself as a good example is profoundly bottoms-up.
p254
aVThat idea of infinite possibility, that magic of anything can happen,
p255
aVonly happens in an environment
p256
aVwhere you really know that there's a fundamental freedom
p257
aVat the level of the individual actor, at the level of the Lego blocks,
p258
aVif you will, that make up the virtual world.
p259
aVYou have to have that level of freedom, and so I'm often asked that,
p260
aVyou know, is there a, kind of, utopian or,
p261
aVis there a utopian tendency to Second Life and things like it,
p262
aVthat you would create a world that has a grand scheme to it?
p263
aVThose top-down schemes are alienating to just about everybody,
p264
aVeven if you mean well when you build them.
p265
aVAnd what's more, human society, when it's controlled,
p266
aVwhen you set out a grand scheme of rules,
p267
aVa new way of people interacting, or a new way of laying out a city, or whatever,
p268
aVthat stuff historically has never scaled much beyond,
p269
aVyou know \u2014 I always laughingly say \u2014 the Mall of America, you know,
p270
aVwhich is like, the largest piece of centrally designed architecture
p271
aVthat, you know, has been built.
p272
aa(lp273
VJH: The Kremlin was pretty big.
p274
aa(lp275
VPR: The Kremlin, yeah. That's true. The whole complex.
p276
aa(lp277
VJH: Give me a story of a tool you created at the beginning
p278
aVin Second Life that you were pretty sure people would want to use
p279
aVin the creation of their avatars or in communicating
p280
aVthat people actually in practice said, no, I'm not interested in that at all,
p281
aVand name something that you didn't come up with
p282
aVthat almost immediately people began to demand.
p283
aa(lp284
VPR: I'm sure I can think of multiple examples of both of those.
p285
aVOne of my favorites. I had this feature that I built into Second Life \u2014
p286
aVI was really passionate about it.
p287
aVIt was an ability to kind of walk up close to somebody
p288
aVand have a more private conversation,
p289
aVbut it wasn't instant messaging because you had to sort of befriend somebody.
p290
aVIt was just this idea that you could kind of have a private chat.
p291
aVI just remember it was one of those examples of data-driven design.
p292
aVI thought it was such a good idea from my perspective,
p293
aVand it was just absolutely never used, and we ultimately \u2014
p294
aVI think we've now turned it off, if I remember.
p295
aVWe finally gave up, took it out of the code.
p296
aVBut more generally, you know, one other example I think about this,
p297
aVwhich is great relative to the utopian idea.
p298
aVSecond Life originally had 16 simulators. It now has 20,000.
p299
aa(lp300
VSo when it only had 16,
p301
aVit was only about as big as this college campus.
p302
aVAnd we had \u2014 we zoned it, you know: we put a nightclub,
p303
aVwe put a disco where you could dance,
p304
aVand then we had a place where you could fight with guns if you wanted to,
p305
aVand we had another place that was like a boardwalk, kind of a Coney Island.
p306
aVAnd we laid out the zoning, but of course,
p307
aVpeople could build all around it however they wanted to.
p308
aVAnd what was so amazing right from the start was that the idea
p309
aVthat we had put out in the zoning concept, basically,
p310
aVwas instantly and thoroughly ignored,
p311
aVand like, two months into the whole thing,
p312
aV\u2014 which is really a small amount of time, even in Second Life time \u2014
p313
aVI remember the users, the people who were then using Second Life,
p314
aVthe residents came to me and said, we want to buy the disco \u2014
p315
aVbecause I had built it \u2014 we want to buy that land and raze it
p316
aVand put houses on it. And I sold it to them \u2014
p317
aVI mean, we transferred ownership and they had a big party
p318
aVand blew up the entire building.
p319
aVAnd I remember that that was just so telling, you know,
p320
aVthat you didn't know exactly what was going to happen.
p321
aVWhen you think about stuff that people have built that's popular \u2014
p322
aa(lp323
VJH: CBGB's has to close eventually, you know. That's the rule.
p324
aa(lp325
VPR: Exactly. And it \u2014 but it closed on day one, basically, in Internet time.
p326
aVYou know, an example of something \u2014 pregnancy.
p327
aVYou can have a baby in Second Life.
p328
aVThis is done entirely using, kind of, the tools that are built into Second Life,
p329
aVso the innate concept of becoming pregnant and having a baby, of course \u2014
p330
aVSecond Life is, at the platform level, at the level of the company \u2014 at Linden Lab \u2014
p331
aVSecond Life has no game properties to it whatsoever.
p332
aVThere is no attempt to structure the experience,
p333
aVto make it utopian in that sense that we put into it.
p334
aVSo of course, we never would have put a mechanism for having babies or, you know,
p335
aVtaking two avatars and merging them, or something.
p336
aa(lp337
VBut people built the ability to have babies and care for babies
p338
aVas a purchasable experience that you can have in Second Life and so \u2014
p339
aVI mean, that's a pretty fascinating example of, you know,
p340
aVwhat goes on in the overall economy.
p341
aVAnd of course, the existence of an economy is another idea.
p342
aVI didn't talk about it, but it's a critical feature.
p343
aVWhen people are given the opportunity to create in the world,
p344
aVthere's really two things they want.
p345
aVOne is fair ownership of the things they create.
p346
aVAnd then the second one is \u2014 if they feel like it,
p347
aVand they're not going to do it in every case, but in many they are \u2014
p348
aVthey want to actually be able to sell that creation
p349
aVas a way of providing for their own livelihood.
p350
aVTrue on the Web \u2014 also true in Second Life.
p351
aVAnd so the existence of an economy is critical.
p352
aa(lp353
VJH: Questions for Philip Rosedale? Right here.
p354
aa(lp355
V(Audience: Well, first an observation, which is that you look like a character.)
p356
aa(lp357
VJH: The observation is, Philip has been accused of looking like a character,
p358
aVan avatar, in Second Life.
p359
aVRespond, and then we'll get the rest of your question.
p360
aa(lp361
VPR: But I don't look like my avatar.
p362
aa(lp363
V(Laughter)
p364
aa(lp365
VHow many people here know what my avatar looks like?
p366
aVThat's probably not very many.
p367
aa(lp368
VJH: Are you ripping off somebody else's avatar with that, sort of \u2014
p369
aVPR: No, no. I didn't. One of the other guys at work had a fantastic avatar \u2014
p370
aVa female avatar \u2014 that I used to be once in a while.
p371
aVBut my avatar is a guy wearing chaps.
p372
aVSpiky hair \u2014 spikier than this. Kind of orange hair.
p373
aVHandlebar mustache. Kind of a Village People sort of a character.
p374
aVSo, very cool.
p375
aa(lp376
VJH: And your question?
p377
aa(lp378
V(Audience: [Unclear].)
p379
aa(lp380
VJH: The question is, there appears to be a lack of cultural fine-tuning in Second Life.
p381
aVIt doesn't seem to have its own culture,
p382
aVand the sort of differences that exist in the real world
p383
aVaren't translated into the Second Life map.
p384
aa(lp385
VPR: Well, first of all, we're very early,
p386
aVso this has only been going on for a few years.
p387
aVAnd so part of what we see is the same evolution of human behavior
p388
aVthat you see in emerging societies.
p389
aVSo a fair criticism \u2014 is what it is \u2014 of Second Life today is that
p390
aVit's more like the Wild West than it is like Rome, from a cultural standpoint.
p391
aVThat said, the evolution of, and the nuanced interaction that creates culture,
p392
aVis happening at 10 times the speed of the real world,
p393
aVand in an environment where, if you walk into a bar in Second Life,
p394
aV65 percent of the people there are not in the United States,
p395
aVand in fact are speaking their, you know, various and different languages.
p396
aVIn fact, one of the ways to make money in Second Life
p397
aVis to make really cool translators that you drag onto your body
p398
aVand they basically, kind of, pop up on your screen
p399
aVand allow you to use Google or Babel Fish
p400
aVor one of the other online text translators to on-the-fly
p401
aVtranslate spoken \u2014 I'm sorry \u2014 typed text between individuals.
p402
aVAnd so, the multicultural nature and the sort of cultural melting pot
p403
aVthat's happening inside Second Life is quite \u2014
p404
aVI think, quite remarkable relative to what in real human terms
p405
aVin the real world we've ever been able to achieve.
p406
aVSo, I think that culture will fine-tune, it will emerge,
p407
aVbut we still have some years to wait while that happens,
p408
aVas you would naturally expect.
p409
aa(lp410
VJH: Other questions? Right here.
p411
aa(lp412
V(Audience: What's your demographic?)
p413
aa(lp414
VJH: What's your demographic?
p415
aVPR: So, the question is, what's the demographic.
p416
aVSo, the average age of a person in Second Life is 32,
p417
aVhowever, the use of Second Life increases dramatically
p418
aVas your physical age increases. So as you go from age 30 to age 60 \u2014
p419
aVand there are many people in their sixties using Second Life \u2014
p420
aVthis is also not a sharp curve \u2014 it's very, very distributed \u2014
p421
aVusage goes up in terms of, like, hours per week by 40 percent
p422
aVas you go from age 30 to age 60 in real life, so there's not \u2014
p423
aVmany people make the mistake of believing that Second Life
p424
aVis some kind of an online game. Actually it's generally unappealing \u2014
p425
aVI'm just speaking broadly and critically \u2014
p426
aVit's not very appealing to people that play online video games,
p427
aVbecause the graphics are not yet equivalent to \u2014
p428
aVI mean, these are very nice pictures,
p429
aVbut in general the graphics are not quite equivalent
p430
aVto the fine-tuned graphics that you see in a Grand Theft Auto 4.
p431
aVSo average age: 32. I mentioned
p432
aV65 percent of the users are not in the United States.
p433
aVThe distribution amongst countries is extremely broad.
p434
aa(lp435
VThere's users from, you know, virtually every country in the world now in Second Life.
p436
aVThe dominant ones are \u2014 if you take the UK and Europe,
p437
aVtogether they make up about 55 percent of the usage base in Second Life.
p438
aVIn terms of psychographic \u2014
p439
aVoh, men and women: men and women are almost equally matched in Second Life,
p440
aVso about 45 percent of the people online right now on Second Life are women.
p441
aVWomen use Second Life, though,
p442
aVabout 30 to 40 percent more, on an hours basis, than men do,
p443
aVmeaning that more men sign up than women,
p444
aVand more women stay and use it than men.
p445
aVSo that's another demographic fact.
p446
aVIn terms of psychographic, you know, the people in Second Life
p447
aVare remarkably dissimilar relative to what you might think,
p448
aVwhen you go in and talk to them and meet them, and I would, you know,
p449
aVchallenge you to just do this and find out.
p450
aVBut it's not a bunch of programmers.
p451
aVIt's not easy to describe as a demographic.
p452
aVIf I had to just sort of paint a broad picture, I'd say, remember the people
p453
aVwho were really getting into eBay in the first few years of eBay?
p454
aVMaybe a little bit like that: in other words, people who are early adopters.
p455
aVThey tend to be creative. They tend to be entrepreneurial.
p456
aVA lot of them \u2014 about 55,000 people so far \u2014 are cash-flow positive:
p457
aVthey're making money from what \u2014 I mean, real-world money \u2014
p458
aVfrom what they're doing in Second Life, so it's a very build \u2014
p459
aVstill a creative, building things, build-your-own-business
p460
aVtype of an orientation. So, that's it.
p461
aa(lp462
VJH: You describe yourself, Philip, as someone who was really creative
p463
aVwhen you were young and, you know, liked to make things.
p464
aVI mean, it's not often that you hear somebody
p465
aVdescribe themselves as really creative.
p466
aVI suspect that's possibly a euphemism for C student
p467
aVwho spent a lot of time in his room? Is it possible?
p468
aa(lp469
V(Laughter)
p470
aa(lp471
VPR: I was a \u2014 there were times I was a C student. You know, it's funny.
p472
aVWhen I got to college \u2014 I studied physics in college \u2014
p473
aVand I got really \u2014 it was funny,
p474
aVbecause I was definitely a more antisocial kid. I read all the time.
p475
aVI was shy. I don't seem like it now, but I was very shy.
p476
aVMoved around a bunch \u2014 had that experience too.
p477
aVSo I did, kind of, I think, live in my own world,
p478
aVand obviously that helps, you know, engage your real interest in something.
p479
aa(lp480
VJH: So you're on your fifth life at this point?
p481
aa(lp482
VPR: If you count, yeah, cities. So \u2014 but I did \u2014
p483
aVand I didn't do \u2014 I think I didn't do as well in school as I could have. I think you're right.
p484
aVI wasn't, like, an obsessed \u2014 you know, get A's kind of guy.
p485
aVI was going to say, I had a great social experience
p486
aVwhen I went to college that I hadn't had before,
p487
aVa more fraternal experience, where I met six or seven other guys
p488
aVwho I studied physics with, and I was very competitive with them,
p489
aVso then I started to get A's. But you're right: I wasn't an A student.
p490
aa(lp491
VJH: Last question. Right here.
p492
aa(lp493
V(Audience: In the pamphlet, there's a statement \u2014 )
p494
aa(lp495
VJH: You want to paraphrase that?
p496
aa(lp497
VPR: Yeah, so let me restate that.
p498
aVSo, you're saying that in the pamphlet there's a statement
p499
aVthat we may come to prefer our digital selves to our real ones \u2014
p500
aVour more malleable or manageable digital identities to our real identities \u2014
p501
aVand that in fact, much of human life and human experience
p502
aVmay move into the digital realm.
p503
aVAnd then that's kind of a horrifying thought, of course.
p504
aVThat's a frightening change, frightening disruption.
p505
aVI guess, and you're asking, what do I think about that? How do I \u2014
p506
aa(lp507
VJH: What's your response to the people who would say, that's horrifying?
p508
aa(lp509
V(Audience: If someone would say to you, I find that disturbing,
p510
aVwhat would be your response?)
p511
aa(lp512
VPR: Well, I'd say a couple of things.
p513
aVOne is, it's disturbing like the Internet or electricity was.
p514
aVThat is to say, it's a big change, but it isn't avoidable.
p515
aVSo, no amount of backpedaling or intentional behavior
p516
aVor political behavior is going to keep these technology changes
p517
aVfrom connecting us together,
p518
aVbecause the basic motive that people have \u2014
p519
aVto be creative and entrepreneurial \u2014 is going to drive energy
p520
aVinto these virtual worlds in the same way that it has with the Web.
p521
aVSo this change, I believe, is a huge disruptive change.
p522
aa(lp523
VObviously, I'm the optimist and a big believer in what's going on here,
p524
aVbut I think that as \u2014 even a sober, you know, the most sober,
p525
aVdisconnected thinker about this, looking at it from the side,
p526
aVhas to conclude, based on the data,
p527
aVthat with those kinds of economic forces at play,
p528
aVthere is definitely going to be a sea change,
p529
aVand that change is going to be intensely disruptive
p530
aVrelative to our concept of our very lives and being,
p531
aVand our identities, as well.
p532
aVI don't think we can get away from those changes.
p533
aVI think generally, we were talking about this \u2014
p534
aVI think that generally being present in a virtual world and being challenged by it,
p535
aVbeing \u2014 surviving there, having a good life there, so to speak,
p536
aVis a challenge because of the multiculturality of it,
p537
aVbecause of the languages, because of the entrepreneurial richness of it,
p538
aVthe sort of flea market nature, if you will, of the virtual world today.
p539
aa(lp540
VIt puts challenges on us to rise to. We must be better than ourselves, in many ways.
p541
aVWe must learn things and, you know, be more tolerant,
p542
aVand be smarter and learn faster and be more creative, perhaps,
p543
aVthan we are typically in our real lives.
p544
aVAnd I think that if that is true of virtual worlds,
p545
aVthen these changes, though scary \u2014 and, I say, inevitable \u2014
p546
aVare ultimately for the better,
p547
aVand therefore something that we should ride out.
p548
aVBut I would say that \u2014 and many other authors and speakers about this,
p549
aVother than me, have said, you know, fasten your seat belts
p550
aVbecause the change is coming. There are going to be big changes.
p551
