VZika fever:
p4
aVour newest dread disease.
p5
aVWhat is it? Where'd it come from?
p6
aa(lp7
VWhat do we do about it?
p8
aVWell for most adults, it's a relatively mild disease \u2014
p9
aVa little fever, a little headache, joint pain, maybe a rash.
p10
aVIn fact, most people who get it don't even know they've had it.
p11
aVBut the more we find out about the Zika virus
p12
aVthe more terrifying it becomes.
p13
aVFor example, doctors have noticed an uptick
p14
aVof something called Guillain-Barré syndrome in recent outbreaks.
p15
aVIn Guillain-Barré, your immune system attacks your nerve cells
p16
aVit can partially or even totally paralyze you.
p17
aVFortunately, that's quite rare, and most people recover.
p18
aVBut if you're pregnant when you're infected
p19
aVyou're at risk of something terrible.
p20
aVIndeed, a child with a deformed head.
p21
aa(lp22
VHere's a normal baby.
p23
aVHere's that infant with what's called microcephaly.
p24
aVa brain in a head that's too small.
p25
aVAnd there's no known cure.
p26
aVIt was actually doctors in northeastern Brazil
p27
aVwho first noticed, just a year ago, after a Zika outbreak,
p28
aVthat there was a peak in the incidence of microcephaly.
p29
aVIt took medical doctors another year
p30
aVto be sure that it was caused by the Zika virus,
p31
aVbut they're now sure.
p32
aVAnd if you're a "bring on the evidence" type,
p33
aVcheck out this publication.
p34
aa(lp35
VSo where did it come from, and how did it get here?
p36
aVAnd it is here.
p37
aVLike many of our viruses, it came out of Africa,
p38
aVspecifically the Zika forest in Uganda.
p39
aVResearchers at the nearby Yellow Fever Research Institute
p40
aVidentified an unknown virus in a monkey in the Zika forest
p41
aVwhich is how it got its name.
p42
aVThe first human cases of Zika fever
p43
aVsurfaced a few years later in Uganda-Tanzania.
p44
aVThe virus then spread through West Africa
p45
aVand east through equatorial Asia \u2014 Pakistan, India, Malaysia, Indonesia.
p46
aVBut it was still mostly in monkeys and, of course, mosquitoes.
p47
aVIn fact in the 60 years between the time it was first identified in 1947 and 2007
p48
aVthere were only 13 reported cases of human Zika fever.
p49
aVAnd then something extraordinary happened on the tiny Micronesian Yap islands.
p50
aVThere was an outbreak that affected fully 75 percent of the population.
p51
aVHow did it get there? By air.
p52
aVToday we have two billion commercial airline passengers.
p53
aVAn infected passenger can board a plane, fly halfway around the world
p54
aVbefore developing symptoms \u2014 if they develop symptoms at all.
p55
aVThen when they land, the local mosquitoes begin to bite them and spread the fever.
p56
aVZika fever then next surfaced in 2013 in French Polynesia.
p57
aVBy December of that year, it was being transmitted locally by the mosquitoes.
p58
aVThat led to an explosive outbreak in which almost 30,000 people were affected.
p59
aVFrom there it radiated around the Pacific.
p60
aVThere were outbreaks in the Cook Islands, in New Caledonia,
p61
aVin Vanuatu, in the Solomon Islands
p62
aVand almost all the way around to the coast of South America and Easter Island.
p63
aVAnd then, in early 2015,
p64
aVthere was an upsurge of cases of a dengue-like syndrome
p65
aVin the city of Natal in northeastern Brazil.
p66
aVThe virus wasn't dengue, it was Zika, and it spread rapidly \u2014
p67
aVRecife down the coast, a big metropolitan center, soon became the epicenter.
p68
aVWell people have speculated that it was 2014 World Cup soccer fans
p69
aVthat brought the virus into the country.
p70
aVBut others have speculated that perhaps it was Pacific Islanders
p71
aVparticipating in championship canoe races
p72
aVthat were held in Rio that year that brought it in.
p73
aa(lp74
VWell today, this is only a year later.
p75
aVThe virus is being locally transmitted by mosquitoes
p76
aVvirtually throughout South America, Central America, Mexico
p77
aVand the Caribbean Islands
p78
aVUntil this year, the many thousands of cases
p79
aVthat have been diagnosed in the US were contracted elsewhere.
p80
aVBut as of this summer, it's being transmitted locally in Miami.
p81
aVIt's here.
p82
aa(lp83
VSo what do we do about it?
p84
aVWell, preventing infection
p85
aVis either about protecting people or about eliminating the mosquitoes.
p86
aVLet's focus on people first.
p87
aVYou can get vaccinated.
p88
aVYou can not travel to Zika areas.
p89
aVOr you can cover up and apply insect repellent.
p90
aVGetting vaccinated is not an option, because there isn't a vaccine yet
p91
aVand there probably won't be for a couple of years.
p92
aVStaying home isn't a foolproof protection either
p93
aVbecause we now know that it can be sexually transmitted.
p94
aVCovering up and applying insect repellent does work ...
p95
aa(lp96
Vuntil you forget.
p97
aa(lp98
V(Laughter)
p99
aVSo that leaves the mosquitoes, and here's how we control them now:
p100
aVspraying insecticides.
p101
aVThe protective gear is necessary because these are toxic chemicals
p102
aVthat kill people as well as bugs.
p103
aVAlthough it does take quite a lot more to kill a person than to kill a bug.
p104
aVThese are pictures from Brazil and Nicaragua.
p105
aVBut it looks the same in Miami, Florida.
p106
aVAnd we of course can spray insecticides from planes.
p107
aVLast summer, mosquito control officials in Dorchester County, South Carolina,
p108
aVauthorized spraying of Naled, an insecticide,
p109
aVearly one morning, as recommended by the manufacturer.
p110
aVLater that day, a beekeeper told reporters
p111
aVthat her bee yard looked like it had been nuked.
p112
aVOops.
p113
aVBees are the good guys.
p114
aVThe citizens of Florida protested, but spraying continued.
p115
aVUnfortunately, so did the increase in the number of Zika fever cases.
p116
aVThat's because insecticides aren't very effective.
p117
aa(lp118
VSo are there any approaches that are perhaps more effective than spraying
p119
aVbut with less downsides than toxic chemicals?
p120
aVI'm a huge fan of biological controls,
p121
aVand I share that view with Rachel Carson, author of "Silent Spring,"
p122
aVthe book that is credited with starting the environmental movement.
p123
aVIn this book she tells the story, as an example,
p124
aVof how a very nasty insect pest of livestock
p125
aVwas eliminated in the last century.
p126
aVNo one knows that extraordinary story today.
p127
aVSo Jack Block and I, when we were writing an editorial
p128
aVabout the mosquito problem today, retold that story.
p129
aVAnd in capsule form, it's that pupae \u2014 that's the immature form of the insect \u2014
p130
aVwere irradiated until they were sterile, grown to adulthood
p131
aVand then released from planes all over the Southwest,
p132
aVthe Southeast and down into Mexico and into Central America
p133
aVliterally by the hundreds of millions from little airplanes,
p134
aVeventually eliminating that terrible insect pest
p135
aVfor most of the Western Hemisphere.
p136
aVOur real purpose in writing this editorial
p137
aVwas to introduce readers to how we can do that today \u2014
p138
aVnot with radiation but with our knowledge of genetics.
p139
aVLet me explain.
p140
aa(lp141
VThis is the bad guy: Aedes aegypti.
p142
aVIt's the most common insect vector of diseases,
p143
aVnot just Zika but dengue, Chikungunya, West Nile virus
p144
aVand that ancient plague, yellow fever.
p145
aVIt's an urban mosquito,
p146
aVand it's the female that does the dirty work.
p147
aVShe bites to get a blood meal to feed her offspring.
p148
aVMales don't bite; they don't even have the mouth parts to bite.
p149
aVA little British company called Oxitec genetically modified that mosquito
p150
aVso that when it mates with a wild female, its eggs don't develop to adulthood.
p151
aVLet me show you.
p152
aVThis is the normal reproductive cycle.
p153
aVOxitec designed the mosquito so that when the male mates with the wild female
p154
aVthe eggs don't develop.
p155
aVSounds impossible?
p156
aVWell let me show you just diagrammatically how they do it.
p157
aVNow this represents the nucleus of a mosquito cell,
p158
aVand that tangle in the middle represents its genome,
p159
aVthe sum total of its genes.
p160
aVScientists added a single gene
p161
aVthat codes for a protein represented by this orange ball
p162
aVthat feeds back on itself to keep cranking out more of that protein.
p163
aVThe extra copies, however, go and gum up the mosquitoes' genes,
p164
aVkilling the organism.
p165
aVTo keep it alive in the laboratory they use a compound called tetracycline.
p166
aVTetracycline shuts off that gene and allows normal development.
p167
aVThey added another little wrinkle so that they could study what happens.
p168
aVAnd that is they added a gene that makes the insect glow under UV light
p169
aVso that when they released it they could follow exactly how far it went
p170
aVhow long it lived and all of the kinds of data
p171
aVfor a good scientific study.
p172
aVNow this is the pupal stage, and at this stage
p173
aVthe females are larger than the males.
p174
aVThat allows them to sort them into the males and the females
p175
aVand they allow only the males to grow to adulthood.
p176
aVAnd let me remind you that males don't bite.
p177
aVFrom there it's pretty simple.
p178
aVThey take beakers full of male mosquitoes,
p179
aVload them into milk cartons, and drive around the city,
p180
aVreleasing them guided by GPS.
p181
aVHere's the mayor of a city releasing the first batch
p182
aVof what they call the "friendly Aedes."
p183
aVNow I wish I could tell you this is an American city, but it's not.
p184
aVIt's Piracicaba, Brazil.
p185
aVThe amazing thing is that in just a year
p186
aVit brought down the cases of dengue by 91 percent.
p187
aVThat's better than any insecticide spraying can do.
p188
aa(lp189
VSo why aren't we using this remarkable biological control in the US?
p190
aVThat's because it's a GMO: a genetically modified organism.
p191
aVNotice the subtitle here says if the FDA would let them
p192
aVthey could do the same thing here, when Zika arrives.
p193
aVAnd of course it has arrived.
p194
aVSo now I have to tell you the short form
p195
aVof the long, torturous story of GM regulation in the US
p196
aVIn the US, there are three agencies that regulate genetically modified organisms:
p197
aVthe FDA, the Food and Drug Administration,
p198
aVthe EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency,
p199
aVand the USDA, US Department of Agriculture.
p200
aVTook these folks two years to decide that it would be the FDA
p201
aVthat would regulate the genetically modified mosquito.
p202
aVAnd they would do it as a new animal drug, if that makes any sense.
p203
aVTook them another five years going back and forth and back and forth
p204
aVto convince the FDA that this would not harm people,
p205
aVand it would not harm the environment.
p206
aVThey finally gave them, this summer, permission to run a little test
p207
aVin the Florida Keys,
p208
aVwhere they had been invited years earlier when they Keys had an outbreak of dengue.
p209
aVWould that it were that easy.
p210
aVWhen the local residents heard
p211
aVthat there would be genetically modified mosquitoes tested in their community
p212
aVsome of them began to organize protests.
p213
aVThey even organized a petition on the internet with this cuddly logo,
p214
aVwhich eventually accumulated some 160,000 signatures
p215
aVAnd they demanded a referendum
p216
aVwhich will be conducted in just a couple of weeks
p217
aVabout whether the trials would be permitted at all.
p218
aa(lp219
VWell it's Miami that really needs these better ways of controlling insects.
p220
aVAnd there the attitudes are changing.
p221
aVIn fact, very recently a bipartisan group of more than 60 legislators
p222
aVwrote to HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell
p223
aVasking that she, at the Federal level, expedite access for Florida
p224
aVto this new technology.
p225
aa(lp226
VSo the bottom line is this:
p227
aVbiological control of harmful insects
p228
aVcan be both more effective and very much more environmentally friendly
p229
aVthan using insecticides, which are toxic chemicals.
p230
aVThat was true in Rachel Carson's time; it's true today.
p231
aVWhat's different is that we have enormously more information
p232
aVabout genetics than we had then,
p233
aVand therefore more ability to use that information
p234
aVto affect these biological controls.
p235
aVAnd I hope that what I've done is aroused your curiosity enough
p236
aVto start your own inquiry \u2014 not into just GM mosquitoes
p237
aVbut to the other genetically modified organisms that are so controversial today.
p238
aVI think if you do that, and you dig down through all of the misinformation,
p239
aVand the marketing
p240
aVon the part of the organic food industry and the Greenpeaces
p241
aVand find the science, the accurate science,
p242
aVyou'll be surprised and pleased.
p243
aa(lp244
VThank you.
