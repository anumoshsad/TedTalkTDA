V(Rainforest noises)
p4
aa(lp5
VIn the summer of 2011, as a tourist,
p6
aVI visited the rainforests of Borneo for the very first time,
p7
aVand as you might imagine,
p8
aVit was the overwhelming sounds of the forest that struck me the most.
p9
aVThere's this constant cacophony of noise.
p10
aVSome things actually do stick out.
p11
aVFor example, this here is a big bird, a rhinoceros hornbill.
p12
aVThis buzzing is a cicada.
p13
aVThis is a family of gibbons.
p14
aVIt's actually singing to each other over a great distance.
p15
aa(lp16
VThe place where this was recorded was in fact a gibbon reserve,
p17
aVwhich is why you can hear so many of them,
p18
aVbut in fact the most important noise that  was coming out of the forest that time
p19
aVwas one that I didn't notice,
p20
aVand in fact nobody there had actually noticed it.
p21
aa(lp22
VSo, as I said, this was a gibbon reserve.
p23
aVThey spend most of their time rehabilitating gibbons,
p24
aVbut they also have to spend a lot of their time
p25
aVprotecting their area from illegal logging that takes place on the side.
p26
aVAnd so if we take the sound of the forest
p27
aVand we actually turn down the gibbons, the insects, and the rest,
p28
aVin the background, the entire time, in recordings you heard,
p29
aVwas the sound of a chainsaw at great distance.
p30
aVThey had three full-time guards who were posted around this sanctuary
p31
aVwhose job was in fact to guard against illegal logging,
p32
aVand one day, we went walking, again as tourists, out into the forest,
p33
aVand within five minutes' walk,
p34
aVwe stumbled upon somebody who was just sawing a tree down,
p35
aVfive minutes' walk, a few hundred meters from the ranger station.
p36
aVThey hadn't been able to hear the chainsaws,
p37
aVbecause as you heard, the forest is very, very loud.
p38
aa(lp39
VIt struck me as quite unacceptable that in this modern time,
p40
aVjust a few hundred meters away  from a ranger station in a sanctuary,
p41
aVthat in fact nobody could hear it when someone who has a chainsaw gets fired up.
p42
aVIt sounds impossible, but in fact, it was quite true.
p43
aa(lp44
VSo how do we stop illegal logging?
p45
aVIt's really tempting, as an engineer, always to come up with a high-tech,
p46
aVsuper-crazy high-tech solution,
p47
aVbut in fact, you're in the rainforest.
p48
aVIt has to be simple, it has to be scalable,
p49
aVand so what we also noticed while were there was that
p50
aVeverything we needed was already there.
p51
aVWe could build a system that would allow us to stop this
p52
aVusing what's already there.
p53
aa(lp54
VWho was there? What was  already in the forest?
p55
aVWell, we had people.
p56
aVWe had this group there that was  dedicated, three full-time guards,
p57
aVthat was dedicated to go and stop it,
p58
aVbut they just needed to know what was happening out in the forest.
p59
aVThe real surprise, this is the big one,
p60
aVwas that there was connectivity out in the forest.
p61
aVThere was cell phone service way out in the middle of nowhere.
p62
aVWe're talking hundreds of kilometers from the nearest road,
p63
aVthere's certainly no electricity, but they had very good cell phone service,
p64
aVthese people in the towns were on Facebook all the time,
p65
aVthey're surfing the web on their phones,
p66
aVand this sort of got me thinking that in fact it would be possible
p67
aVto use the sounds of the forest,
p68
aVpick up the sounds  of chainsaws programmatically,
p69
aVbecause people can't hear them,
p70
aVand send an alert.
p71
aVBut you have to have a device to go up in the trees.
p72
aVSo if we can use some device to listen to the sounds of the forest,
p73
aVconnect to the cell phone network that's there,
p74
aVand send an alert to people on the ground,
p75
aVperhaps we could have a solution to this issue for them.
p76
aa(lp77
VBut let's take a moment to talk about saving the rainforest,
p78
aVbecause it's something that we've definitely all heard about forever.
p79
aVPeople in my generation have heard about saving the rainforest
p80
aVsince we were kids,
p81
aVand it seems that the message has never changed:
p82
aVWe've got to save the rainforest, it's super urgent,
p83
aVthis many football fields have been destroyed yesterday.
p84
aVand yet here we are today, about half of the rainforest remains,
p85
aVand we have potentially more urgent  problems like climate change.
p86
aa(lp87
VBut in fact, this is the little-known fact that I didn't realize at the time:
p88
aVDeforestation accounts  for more greenhouse gas
p89
aVthan all of the world's planes, trains, cars, trucks and ships combined.
p90
aVIt's the second highest contributor to climate change.
p91
aVAlso, according to Interpol,
p92
aVas much as 90 percent of the logging that takes place in the rainforest
p93
aVis illegal logging, like the illegal logging that we saw.
p94
aVSo if we can help people in the forest enforce the rules that are there,
p95
aVthen in fact we could eat heavily into this 17 percent
p96
aVand potentially have a major impact in the short term.
p97
aVIt might just be the cheapest, fastest way to fight climate change.
p98
aa(lp99
VAnd so here's the system that we imagine.
p100
aVIt looks super high tech.
p101
aVThe moment a sound of a chainsaw is heard in the forest,
p102
aVthe device picks up the sound of the chainsaw,
p103
aVit sends an alert through the standard GSM network that's already there
p104
aVto a ranger in the field
p105
aVwho can in fact show up in real time and stop the logging.
p106
aVIt's no more about going out and finding a tree that's been cut.
p107
aVIt's not about seeing  a tree from a satellite
p108
aVin an area that's been clear cut,
p109
aVit's about real-time intervention.
p110
aa(lp111
VSo I said it was the cheapest and fastest way to do it,
p112
aVbut in fact, actually, as you saw, they weren't able to do it,
p113
aVso it may not be so cheap and fast.
p114
aVBut if the devices in the trees were actually cell phones,
p115
aVit could be pretty cheap.
p116
aVCell phones are thrown away by the hundreds of millions every year,
p117
aVhundreds of millions in the U.S. alone,
p118
aVnot counting the rest of the world, which of course we should do,
p119
aVbut in fact, cell phones are great.
p120
aVThey're full of sensors.
p121
aVThey can listen to the sounds of the forest.
p122
aVWe do have to protect them.
p123
aVWe have to put them in this box that you see here,
p124
aVand we do have to power them.
p125
aVPowering them is one of the greater engineering challenges
p126
aVthat we had to deal with,
p127
aVbecause powering a cell phone under a tree canopy,
p128
aVany sort of solar power under a tree canopy,
p129
aVwas an as-yet-unsolved problem,
p130
aVand that's this unique solar panel design that you see here,
p131
aVwhich in fact is built also from recycled byproducts of an industrial process.
p132
aVThese are strips that are cut down.
p133
aa(lp134
VSo this is me putting it all together
p135
aVin my parents' garage, actually.
p136
aVThanks very much to them for allowing me to do that.
p137
aVAs you can see, this is a device up in a tree.
p138
aVWhat you can see from here, perhaps, is that they are pretty well obscured
p139
aVup in the tree canopy at a distance.
p140
aVThat's important, because although they are able to hear chainsaw noises
p141
aVup to a kilometer in the distance,
p142
aVallowing them to cover about three square kilometers,
p143
aVif someone were to take them, it would make the area unprotected.
p144
aa(lp145
VSo does it actually work?
p146
aVWell, to test it, we took it back to Indonesia,
p147
aVnot the same place, but another place,
p148
aVto another gibbon reserve
p149
aVthat was threatened daily by illegal logging.
p150
aVOn the very second day, it picked up illegal chainsaw noises.
p151
aVWe were able to get a real-time alert.
p152
aVI got an email on my phone.
p153
aVActually, we had just climbed the tree. Everyone had just gotten back down.
p154
aVAll these guys are smoking cigarettes,
p155
aVand then I get an email, and they all quiet down,
p156
aVand in fact you can hear the chainsaw
p157
aVreally, really faint in the background,
p158
aVbut no one had noticed it  until that moment.
p159
aVAnd so then we took off to actually stop these loggers.
p160
aVI was pretty nervous.
p161
aVThis is the moment where we've actually arrived close to where the loggers are.
p162
aVThis is the moment where you can see where I'm actually regretting
p163
aVperhaps the entire endeavor.
p164
aVI'm not really sure what's on the other side of this hill.
p165
aVThat guy's much braver than I am.
p166
aVBut he went, so I had to go, walking up,
p167
aVand in fact, he made it over the hill,
p168
aVand interrupted the loggers in the act.
p169
aVFor them, it was such a surprise \u2014
p170
aVthey had never, ever been interrupted before \u2014
p171
aVthat it was such an impressive event for them,
p172
aVthat we've heard from our partners they have not been back since.
p173
aVThey were, in fact, great guys.
p174
aVThey showed us how the entire operation works,
p175
aVand what they really convinced us on the spot was that
p176
aVif you can show up in real time and stop people,
p177
aVit's enough of a deterrent they won't come back.
p178
aa(lp179
VSo \u2014
p180
aVThank you. (Applause)
p181
aa(lp182
VWord of this spread, possibly because we told a lot of people,
p183
aVand in fact, then some really amazing stuff started to happen.
p184
aVPeople from around the world started to send us emails, phone calls.
p185
aVWhat we saw was that people throughout Asia,
p186
aVpeople throughout Africa, people throughout South America,
p187
aVthey told us that they could use it too,
p188
aVand what's most important,
p189
aVwhat we'd found that we thought might be exceptional,
p190
aVin the forest there was pretty good cell phone service.
p191
aVThat was not exceptional, we were told,
p192
aVand that particularly is on the periphery of the forests that are most under threat.
p193
aVAnd then something  really amazing happened,
p194
aVwhich was that people started sending us their own old cell phones.
p195
aVSo in fact what we have now is a system
p196
aVwhere we can use people on the ground, people who are already there,
p197
aVwho can both improve and use the existing connectivity,
p198
aVand we're using old cell phones that are being sent to us
p199
aVby people from around the world
p200
aVthat want their phones to be doing  something else in their afterlife,
p201
aVso to speak.
p202
aVAnd if the rest of the device can be completely recycled,
p203
aVthen we believe it's an entirely upcycled device.
p204
aa(lp205
VSo again, this didn't come because of any sort of high-tech solution.
p206
aVIt just came from using what's already there,
p207
aVand I'm thoroughly convinced that if it's not phones,
p208
aVthat there's always going to be enough there
p209
aVthat you can build similar solutions
p210
aVthat can be very effective in new contexts.
p211
aa(lp212
VThank you very much.
