VI'm McKenna Pope. I'm 14 years old,
p4
aVand when I was 13, I convinced
p5
aVone of the largest toy companies,
p6
aVtoymakers, in the world, Hasbro,
p7
aVto change the way that they marketed
p8
aVone of their most best-selling products.
p9
aa(lp10
VSo allow me to tell you about it.
p11
aVSo I have a brother, Gavin.
p12
aVWhen this whole shebang happened, he was four.
p13
aVHe loved to cook.
p14
aVHe was always getting ingredients out of the fridge
p15
aVand mixing them into these, needless to say,
p16
aVuneatable concoctions,
p17
aVor making invisible macaroni and cheese.
p18
aVHe wanted to be a chef really badly.
p19
aVAnd so what better gift for a kid who wanted to be a chef
p20
aVthan an Easy-Bake Oven. Right?
p21
aVI mean, we all had those when we were little.
p22
aVAnd he wanted one so badly.
p23
aa(lp24
VBut then he started to realize something.
p25
aVIn the commercials, and on the  boxes for the Easy-Bake Ovens,
p26
aVHasbro marketed them specifically to girls.
p27
aVAnd the way that they did this
p28
aVwas they would only feature girls on the boxes or in the commercials,
p29
aVand there would be flowery prints all over the ovens
p30
aVand it would be in bright pink and purple,
p31
aVvery gender-specific colors to females, right?
p32
aVSo it kind of was sending a message
p33
aVthat only girls are supposed to cook; boys aren't.
p34
aVAnd this discouraged my brother a lot.
p35
aVHe thought that he wasn't supposed to want to be a chef,
p36
aVbecause that was something that girls did.
p37
aVGirls cooked; boys didn't,
p38
aVor so was the message that Hasbro was sending.
p39
aa(lp40
VAnd this got me thinking,
p41
aVGod, I wish there was a way that I could change this,
p42
aVthat could I have my voice heard by Hasbro
p43
aVso I could ask them and tell them
p44
aVwhat they were doing wrong
p45
aVand ask them to change it.
p46
aVAnd that got me thinking about a website
p47
aVthat I had learned about a few months prior
p48
aVcalled Change.org.
p49
aVChange.org is an online petition-sharing platform
p50
aVwhere you can create a petition and share it
p51
aVacross all of these social media networks,
p52
aVthrough Facebook, through Twitter,
p53
aVthrough YouTube, through Reddit, through Tumblr,
p54
aVthrough whatever you can think of.
p55
aVAnd so I created a petition
p56
aValong with the YouTube video that I added to the petition
p57
aVbasically asking Hasbro
p58
aVto change the way that they marketed it,
p59
aVin featuring boys in the commercials, on the boxes,
p60
aVand most of all creating them
p61
aVin less gender-specific colors.
p62
aa(lp63
VSo this petition started to take off \u2014
p64
aVhumongously fast, you have no idea.
p65
aVI was getting interviewed by all these national news outlets
p66
aVand press outlets, and it was amazing.
p67
aVIn three weeks, maybe three and a half,
p68
aVI had 46,000 signatures on this petition.
p69
aa(lp70
V(Applause)
p71
aa(lp72
VThank you.
p73
aa(lp74
VSo, needless to say, it was crazy.
p75
aVEventually, Hasbro themselves invited me to their headquarters
p76
aVso they could go and unveil
p77
aVtheir new Easy-Bake Oven product to me
p78
aVin black, silver and blue.
p79
aVIt was literally one of the best moments of my life.
p80
aVIt was like "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory."
p81
aVThat thing was amazing.
p82
aa(lp83
VWhat I didn't realize at the time, however,
p84
aVwas that I had become an activist,
p85
aVI could change something,
p86
aVthat even as a kid, or maybe  even especially as a kid,
p87
aVmy voice mattered, and your voice matters too.
p88
aVI want to let you know it's not going to be easy,
p89
aVand it wasn't easy for me,
p90
aVbecause I faced a lot of obstacles.
p91
aVPeople online, and sometimes even in real life,
p92
aVwere disrespectful to me and my family,
p93
aVand talked about how the whole thing was a waste of time,
p94
aVand it really discouraged me.
p95
aVAnd actually, I have some examples, because what's better revenge
p96
aVthan displaying their idiocy?
p97
aVSo, let's see.
p98
aVFrom user name Liquidsore29 \u2014
p99
aVinteresting user names we have here\u2014
p100
aV"Disgusting liberal moms making their sons gay."
p101
aVLiquidsore29, really? Really? Okay.
p102
aVHow about from Whiteboy77AGS:
p103
aV"People always need something to (female dog) about."
p104
aVFrom Jeffrey Gutierrez:
p105
aV"OMG, shut up. You just want money and attention."
p106
aa(lp107
VSo it was comments like these
p108
aVthat really discouraged me from wanting to make change in the future
p109
aVbecause I thought, people don't care,
p110
aVpeople think it's a waste of time,
p111
aVand people are going to be disrespectful  to me and my family.
p112
aVIt hurt me, and it made me think,
p113
aVwhat's the point of making change in the future?
p114
aa(lp115
VBut then I started to realize something.
p116
aVHaters gonna hate.
p117
aVCome on, say it with me. One, two, three:
p118
aVHaters gonna hate.
p119
aVSo let your haters hate,
p120
aVyou know what, and make your change,
p121
aVbecause I know you can.
p122
aVI look out into this crowd,
p123
aVand I see 400 people
p124
aVwho came out because they wanted to know how they could make a change,
p125
aVand I know that you can, and all of you watching at home can too
p126
aVbecause you have so much that you  can do and that you believe in,
p127
aVand you can trade it across all these social media,
p128
aVthrough Facebook, through Twitter, through  YouTube, through Reddit, through Tumblr,
p129
aVthrough whatever else you can think of.
p130
aVAnd you can make that change.
p131
aVYou can take what you believe in
p132
aVand turn it into a cause and change it.
p133
aVAnd that spark that you've been  hearing about all day today,
p134
aVyou can use that spark that you have within you
p135
aVand turn it into a fire.
p136
aa(lp137
VThank you.
