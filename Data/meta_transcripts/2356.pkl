VI'd like to start by asking you all to go to your happy place, please.
p4
aVYes, your happy place,
p5
aVI know you've got one even if it's fake.
p6
aa(lp7
V(Laughter)
p8
aa(lp9
VOK, so, comfortable?
p10
aVGood.
p11
aa(lp12
VNow I'd like to you to mentally answer the following questions.
p13
aVIs there any strip lighting in your happy place?
p14
aVAny plastic tables?
p15
aVPolyester flooring?
p16
aVMobile phones?
p17
aVNo?
p18
aVI think we all know that our happy place
p19
aVis meant to be somewhere natural, outdoors \u2014
p20
aVon a beach, fireside.
p21
aVWe'll be reading or eating or knitting.
p22
aVAnd we're surrounded by natural light and organic elements.
p23
aVNatural things make us happy.
p24
aVAnd happiness is a great motivator; we strive for happiness.
p25
aVPerhaps that's why we're always redesigning everything,
p26
aVin the hopes that our solutions might feel more natural.
p27
aVSo let's start there \u2014
p28
aVwith the idea that good design should feel natural.
p29
aa(lp30
VYour phone is not very natural.
p31
aVAnd you probably think you're addicted to your phone,
p32
aVbut you're really not.
p33
aVWe're not addicted to devices,
p34
aVwe're addicted to the information that flows through them.
p35
aVI wonder how long you would be happy in your happy place
p36
aVwithout any information from the outside world.
p37
aVI'm interested in how we access that information,
p38
aVhow we experience it.
p39
aVWe're moving from a time of static information,
p40
aVheld in books and libraries and bus stops,
p41
aVthrough a period of digital information,
p42
aVtowards a period of fluid information,
p43
aVwhere your children will expect to be able to access anything, anywhere at any time,
p44
aVfrom quantum physics to medieval viticulture,
p45
aVfrom gender theory to tomorrow's weather,
p46
aVjust like switching on a lightbulb \u2014
p47
aVImagine that.
p48
aa(lp49
VHumans also like simple tools.
p50
aVYour phone is not a very simple tool.
p51
aVA fork is a simple tool.
p52
aa(lp53
V(Laughter)
p54
aa(lp55
VAnd we don't like them made of plastic,
p56
aVin the same way I don't really like my phone very much \u2014
p57
aVit's not how I want to experience information.
p58
aa(lp59
VI think there are better solutions than a world mediated by screens.
p60
aVI don't hate screens, but I don't feel \u2014
p61
aVand I don't think any of us feel that good
p62
aVabout how much time we spend slouched over them.
p63
aVFortunately,
p64
aVthe big tech companies seem to agree.
p65
aVThey're actually heavily invested in touch and speech and gesture,
p66
aVand also in senses \u2014
p67
aVthings that can turn dumb objects, like cups,
p68
aVand imbue them with the magic of the Internet,
p69
aVpotentially turning this digital cloud
p70
aVinto something we might touch and move.
p71
aa(lp72
VThe parents in crisis over screen time
p73
aVneed physical digital toys teaching their kids to read,
p74
aVas well as family-safe app stores.
p75
aVAnd I think, actually, that's already really happening.
p76
aa(lp77
VReality is richer than screens.
p78
aVFor example, I love books.
p79
aVFor me they are time machines \u2014 atoms and molecules bound in space,
p80
aVfrom the moment of their creation to the moment of my experience.
p81
aVBut frankly,
p82
aVthe content's identical on my phone.
p83
aVSo what makes this a richer experience than a screen?
p84
aVI mean, scientifically.
p85
aVWe need screens, of course.
p86
aVI'm going to show film, I need the enormous screen.
p87
aVBut there's more than you can do with these magic boxes.
p88
aVYour phone is not the Internet's door bitch.
p89
aa(lp90
V(Laughter)
p91
aa(lp92
VWe can build things \u2014 physical things,
p93
aVusing physics and pixels,
p94
aVthat can integrate the Internet into the world around us.
p95
aVAnd I'm going to show you a few examples of those.
p96
aa(lp97
VA while ago, I got to work with a design agency, Berg,
p98
aVon an exploration of what the Internet without screens might actually look like.
p99
aVAnd they showed us a range ways
p100
aVthat light can work with simple senses and physical objects
p101
aVto really bring the Internet to life, to make it tangible.
p102
aVLike this wonderfully mechanical YouTube player.
p103
aVAnd this was an inspiration to me.
p104
aa(lp105
VNext I worked with the Japanese agency, AQ,
p106
aVon a research project into mental health.
p107
aVWe wanted to create an object
p108
aVthat could capture the subjective data around mood swings
p109
aVthat's so essential to diagnosis.
p110
aVThis object captures your touch,
p111
aVso you might press it very hard if you're angry,
p112
aVor stroke it if you're calm.
p113
aVIt's like a digital emoji stick.
p114
aVAnd then you might revisit those moments later,
p115
aVand add context to them online.
p116
aVMost of all,
p117
aVwe wanted to create an intimate, beautiful thing
p118
aVthat could live in your pocket
p119
aVand be loved.
p120
aa(lp121
VThe binoculars are actually a birthday present
p122
aVfor the Sydney Opera House's 40th anniversary.
p123
aVOur friends at Tellart in Boston brought over a pair of street binoculars,
p124
aVthe kind you might find on the Empire State Building,
p125
aVand they fitted them with 360-degree views
p126
aVof other iconic world heritage sights \u2014
p127
aa(lp128
V(Laughter)
p129
aa(lp130
Vusing Street View.
p131
aVAnd then we stuck them under the steps.
p132
aVSo, they became this very physical, simple reappropriation,
p133
aVor like a portal to these other icons.
p134
aVSo you might see Versailles or Shackleton's Hut.
p135
aVBasically, it's virtual reality circa 1955.
p136
aa(lp137
V(Laughter)
p138
aa(lp139
VIn our office we use hacky sacks to exchange URLs.
p140
aVThis is incredibly simple, it's like your Opal card.
p141
aVYou basically put a website on the little chip in here,
p142
aVand then you do this and ... bosh! \u2014
p143
aVthe website appears on your phone.
p144
aVIt's about 10 cents.
p145
aa(lp146
VTreehugger is a project that we're working on
p147
aVwith Grumpy Sailor and Finch, here in Sydney.
p148
aVAnd I'm very excited about what might happen
p149
aVwhen you pull the phones apart and you put the bits into trees,
p150
aVand that my children might have an opportunity
p151
aVto visit an enchanted forest guided by a magic wand,
p152
aVwhere they could talk to digital fairies and ask them questions,
p153
aVand be asked questions in return.
p154
aVAs you can see,
p155
aVwe're at the cardboard stage with this one.
p156
aa(lp157
V(Laughter)
p158
aa(lp159
VBut I'm very excited
p160
aVby the possibility of getting kids back outside without screens,
p161
aVbut with all the powerful magic of the Internet at their fingertips.
p162
aVAnd we hope to have something like this working by the end of the year.
p163
aa(lp164
VSo let's recap.
p165
aVHumans like natural solutions.
p166
aVHumans love information.
p167
aVHumans need simple tools.
p168
aVThese principles should underpin how we design for the future,
p169
aVnot just for the Internet.
p170
aVYou may feel uncomfortable about the age of information that we're moving into.
p171
aVYou may feel challenged, rather than simply excited.
p172
aVGuess what? Me too.
p173
aVIt's a really extraordinary period of human history.
p174
aa(lp175
VWe are the people that actually build our world,
p176
aVthere are no artificial intelligences...
p177
aVyet.
p178
aa(lp179
V(Laughter)
p180
aa(lp181
VIt's us \u2014 designers, architects, artists, engineers.
p182
aVAnd if we challenge ourselves,
p183
aVI think that actually we can have a happy place
p184
aVfilled with the information we love
p185
aVthat feels as natural and as simple as switching on lightbulb.
p186
aVAnd although it may seem inevitable,
p187
aVthat what the public wants is watches and websites and widgets,
p188
aVmaybe we could give a bit of thought to cork and light and hacky sacks.
p189
aa(lp190
VThank you very much.
