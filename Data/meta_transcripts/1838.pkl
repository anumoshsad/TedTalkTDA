VThe work of a transportation commissioner
p4
aVisn't just about stop signs and traffic signals.
p5
aVIt involves the design of cities
p6
aVand the design of city streets.
p7
aVStreets are some of the most valuable resources
p8
aVthat a city has, and yet it's an asset
p9
aVthat's largely hidden in plain sight.
p10
aVAnd the lesson from New York
p11
aVover the past six years
p12
aVis that you can update this asset.
p13
aVYou can remake your streets quickly, inexpensively,
p14
aVit can provide immediate benefits,
p15
aVand it can be quite popular.
p16
aVYou just need to look at them a little differently.
p17
aa(lp18
VThis is important because we live in an urban age.
p19
aVFor the first time in history,
p20
aVmost people live in cities,
p21
aVand the U.N. estimates that over the next 40 years,
p22
aVthe population is going to double on the planet.
p23
aVSo the design of cities is a key issue for our future.
p24
aVMayor Bloomberg recognized this
p25
aVwhen he launched PlaNYC in 2007.
p26
aVThe plan recognized that cities
p27
aVare in a global marketplace,
p28
aVand that if we're going to continue to grow and thrive
p29
aVand to attract the million more people
p30
aVthat are expected to move here,
p31
aVwe need to focus on the quality of life
p32
aVand the efficiency of our infrastructure.
p33
aa(lp34
VFor many cities, our streets have been
p35
aVin a kind of suspended animation for generations.
p36
aVThis is a picture of Times Square in the '50s,
p37
aVand despite all of the technological innovation,
p38
aVcultural changes, political changes,
p39
aVthis is Times Square in 2008.
p40
aVNot much has changed in those 50 years.
p41
aVSo we worked hard to refocus our agenda,
p42
aVto maximize efficient mobility,
p43
aVproviding more room for buses, more room for bikes,
p44
aVmore room for people to enjoy the city,
p45
aVand to make our streets as safe as they can be
p46
aVfor everybody that uses them.
p47
aa(lp48
VWe set out a clear action plan
p49
aVwith goals and benchmarks.
p50
aVHaving goals is important,
p51
aVbecause if you want to change and steer the ship
p52
aVof a big city in a new direction,
p53
aVyou need to know where you're going and why.
p54
aa(lp55
VThe design of a street can tell you everything
p56
aVabout what's expected on it.
p57
aVIn this case, it's expected that you shelter in place.
p58
aVThe design of this street is really
p59
aVto maximize the movement of cars
p60
aVmoving as quickly as possible
p61
aVfrom point A to point B,
p62
aVand it misses all the other ways
p63
aVthat a street is used.
p64
aa(lp65
VWhen we started out, we did some early surveys
p66
aVabout how our streets were used,
p67
aVand we found that New York City was largely
p68
aVa city without seats.
p69
aVPictures like this, people perched
p70
aVon a fire hydrant, not the mark of a world-class city.
p71
aV(Laughter)
p72
aVIt's not great for parents with kids.
p73
aVIt's not great for seniors. It's not great for retailers.
p74
aVIt's probably not good for the fire hydrants.
p75
aVCertainly not good for the police department.
p76
aa(lp77
VSo we worked hard to change that balance,
p78
aVand probably the best example of our new approach
p79
aVis in Times Square.
p80
aVThree hundred and fifty thousand people a day
p81
aVwalk through Times Square,
p82
aVand people had tried for years to make changes.
p83
aVThey changed signals, they changed lanes,
p84
aVeverything they could do to make Times Square work better.
p85
aVIt was dangerous, hard to cross the street.
p86
aVIt was chaotic.
p87
aVAnd so, none of those approaches worked,
p88
aVso we took a different approach, a bigger approach,
p89
aVlooked at our street differently.
p90
aVAnd so we did a six-month pilot.
p91
aVWe closed Broadway from 42nd Street to 47th Street
p92
aVand created two and a half acres
p93
aVof new pedestrian space.
p94
aVAnd the temporary materials are an important part
p95
aVof the program, because we were able to show
p96
aVhow it worked.
p97
aVAnd I work for a data-driven mayor, as you probably know.
p98
aVSo it was all about the data.
p99
aVSo if it worked better for traffic, if it was better for mobility,
p100
aVif it was safer, better for business, we would keep it,
p101
aVand if it didn't work, no harm, no foul,
p102
aVwe could put it back the way that it was,
p103
aVbecause these were temporary materials.
p104
aVAnd that was a very big part of the buy-in,
p105
aVmuch less anxiety when you think that something
p106
aVcan be put back.
p107
aVBut the results were overwhelming.
p108
aVTraffic moved better. It was much safer.
p109
aVFive new flagship stores opened.
p110
aVIt's been a total home run.
p111
aVTimes Square is now one of the top 10
p112
aVretail locations on the planet.
p113
aVAnd this is an important lesson,
p114
aVbecause it doesn't need to be a zero-sum game
p115
aVbetween moving traffic and creating public space.
p116
aa(lp117
VEvery project has its surprises,
p118
aVand one of the big surprises with Times Square
p119
aVwas how quickly people flocked to the space.
p120
aVWe put out the orange barrels,
p121
aVand people just materialized immediately into the street.
p122
aVIt was like a Star Trek episode, you know?
p123
aVThey weren't there before, and then zzzzzt!
p124
aVAll the people arrived.
p125
aVWhere they'd been, I don't know, but they were there.
p126
aVAnd this actually posed an immediate challenge for us,
p127
aVbecause the street furniture had not yet arrived.
p128
aVSo we went to a hardware store
p129
aVand bought hundreds of lawn chairs,
p130
aVand we put those lawn chairs out on the street.
p131
aVAnd the lawn chairs became the talk of the town.
p132
aVIt wasn't about that we'd closed Broadway to cars.
p133
aVIt was about those lawn chairs.
p134
aV"What did you think about the lawn chairs?"
p135
aV"Do you like the color of the lawn chairs?"
p136
aVSo if you've got a big, controversial project,
p137
aVthink about lawn chairs.
p138
aV(Laughter)
p139
aa(lp140
VThis is the final design for Times Square,
p141
aVand it will create a level surface,
p142
aVsidewalk to sidewalk,
p143
aVbeautiful pavers that have studs in them
p144
aVto reflect the light from the billboards,
p145
aVcreating a great new energy on the street,
p146
aVand we think it's going to really create
p147
aVa great place, a new crossroads of the world
p148
aVthat is worthy of its name.
p149
aVAnd we will be cutting the ribbon on this,
p150
aVthe first phase, this December.
p151
aa(lp152
VWith all of our projects, our public space projects,
p153
aVwe work closely with local businesses
p154
aVand local merchant groups
p155
aVwho maintain the spaces, move the furniture,
p156
aVtake care of the plants.
p157
aVThis is in front of Macy's, and they were
p158
aVa big supporter of this new approach,
p159
aVbecause they understood that more people on foot
p160
aVis better for business.
p161
aa(lp162
VAnd we've done these projects all across the city
p163
aVin all kinds of neighborhoods.
p164
aVThis is in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn,
p165
aVand you can see the short leg that was there,
p166
aVused for cars, that's not really needed.
p167
aVSo what we did is we painted over the street,
p168
aVput down epoxy gravel, and connected the triangle
p169
aVto the storefronts on Grand Avenue,
p170
aVcreated a great new public space,
p171
aVand it's been great for businesses
p172
aValong Grand Avenue.
p173
aVWe did the same thing in DUMBO, in Brooklyn,
p174
aVand this is one of our first projects that we did,
p175
aVand we took an underutilized,
p176
aVpretty dingy-looking parking lot
p177
aVand used some paint and planters
p178
aVto transform it over a weekend.
p179
aVAnd in the three years since we've implemented the project,
p180
aVretail sales have increased 172 percent.
p181
aVAnd that's twice that of adjacent areas in the same neighborhood.
p182
aa(lp183
VWe've moved very, very quickly
p184
aVwith paint and temporary materials.
p185
aVInstead of waiting
p186
aVthrough years of planning studies
p187
aVand computer models to get something done,
p188
aVwe've done it with paint and temporary materials.
p189
aVAnd the proof is not in a computer model.
p190
aVIt is in the real-world performance of the street.
p191
aVYou can have fun with paint.
p192
aa(lp193
VAll told, we've created over 50 pedestrian plazas
p194
aVin all five boroughs across the city.
p195
aVWe've repurposed 26 acres of active car lanes
p196
aVand turned them into new pedestrian space.
p197
aa(lp198
VI think one of the successes is in its emulation.
p199
aVYou're seeing this kind of approach,
p200
aVsince we've painted Times Square,
p201
aVyou've seen this approach in Boston, in Chicago,
p202
aVin San Francisco, in Mexico City,
p203
aVBuenos Aires, you name it.
p204
aVThis is actually in Los Angeles,
p205
aVand they actually copied even the green dots
p206
aVthat we had on the streets.
p207
aVBut I can't underscore enough
p208
aVhow much more quickly this enables you to move
p209
aVover traditional construction methods.
p210
aa(lp211
VWe also brought this quick-acting approach
p212
aVto our cycling program,
p213
aVand in six years turned cycling
p214
aVinto a real transportation option in New York.
p215
aVI think it's fair to say \u2014
p216
aV(Applause) \u2014
p217
aVit used to be a fairly scary place to ride a bike,
p218
aVand now New York has become
p219
aVone of the cycling capitals in the United States.
p220
aa(lp221
VAnd we moved quickly to create an interconnected
p222
aVnetwork of lanes.
p223
aVYou can see the map in 2007.
p224
aVThis is how it looked in 2013
p225
aVafter we built out 350 miles of on-street bike lanes.
p226
aVI love this because it looks so easy.
p227
aVYou just click it, and they're there.
p228
aVWe also brought new designs to the street.
p229
aVWe created the first parking-protected bike lane
p230
aVin the United States.
p231
aa(lp232
V(Applause)
p233
aa(lp234
VWe protected bikers by floating parking lanes,
p235
aVand it's been great.
p236
aVBike volumes have spiked.
p237
aVInjuries to all users, pedestrians, cyclists, drivers,
p238
aVare all down 50 percent.
p239
aVAnd we've built 30 miles of these protected bike lanes,
p240
aVand now you're seeing them pop up
p241
aVall over the country.
p242
aVAnd you can see here that this strategy has worked.
p243
aVThe blue line is the number of cyclists,
p244
aVsoaring.
p245
aVThe green line is the number of bike lanes.
p246
aVAnd the yellow line is the number of injuries,
p247
aVwhich has remained essentially flat.
p248
aVAfter this big expansion, you've seen
p249
aVno net increase in injuries,
p250
aVand so there is something to that axiom
p251
aVthat there is safety in numbers.
p252
aa(lp253
VNot everybody liked the new bike lanes,
p254
aVand there was a lawsuit and somewhat
p255
aVof a media frenzy a couple years ago.
p256
aVOne Brooklyn paper called this bike lane
p257
aVthat we have on Prospect Park West
p258
aV"the most contested piece of land
p259
aVoutside of the Gaza Strip."
p260
aa(lp261
V(Laughter)
p262
aa(lp263
VAnd this is what we had done.
p264
aVSo if you dig below the headlines, though,
p265
aVyou'll see that the people were far ahead of the press,
p266
aVfar ahead of the politicians.
p267
aVIn fact, I think most politicians would be happy
p268
aVto have those kind of poll numbers.
p269
aVSixty-four percent of New Yorkers support these bike lanes.
p270
aa(lp271
VThis summer, we launched Citi Bike,
p272
aVthe largest bike share program in the United States,
p273
aVwith 6,000 bikes
p274
aVand 330 stations located next to one another.
p275
aVSince we've launched the program,
p276
aVthree million trips have been taken.
p277
aVPeople have ridden seven million miles.
p278
aVThat's 280 times around the globe.
p279
aVAnd so with this little blue key,
p280
aVyou can unlock the keys to the city
p281
aVand this brand new transportation option.
p282
aa(lp283
VAnd daily usage just continues to soar.
p284
aVWhat has happened is the average daily ridership
p285
aVon the streets of New York is 36,000 people.
p286
aVThe high that we've had so far is 44,000 in August.
p287
aVYesterday, 40,000 people used Citi Bike in New York City.
p288
aVThe bikes are being used six times a day.
p289
aVAnd I think you also see it in the kinds of riders
p290
aVthat are on the streets.
p291
aVIn the past, it looked like the guy on the left,
p292
aVninja-clad bike messenger.
p293
aVAnd today, cyclists look
p294
aVlike New York City looks.
p295
aVIt's diverse \u2014 young, old, black, white,
p296
aVwomen, kids, all getting on a bike.
p297
aVIt's an affordable, safe, convenient way to get around.
p298
aVQuite radical.
p299
aa(lp300
VWe've also brought this approach to our buses,
p301
aVand New York City has the largest bus fleet in North America,
p302
aVthe slowest bus speeds.
p303
aVAs everybody knows,
p304
aVyou can walk across town faster
p305
aVthan you can take the bus.
p306
aVAnd so we focused on the most congested areas
p307
aVof New York City,
p308
aVbuilt out six bus rapid transit lines,
p309
aV57 miles of new speedy bus lanes.
p310
aVYou pay at a kiosk before you get on the bus.
p311
aVWe've got dedicated lanes that keep cars out
p312
aVbecause they get ticketed by a camera
p313
aVif they use that lane,
p314
aVand it's been a huge success.
p315
aa(lp316
VI think one of my very favorite moments
p317
aVas transportation commissioner was the day
p318
aVthat we launched Citi Bike,
p319
aVand I was riding Citi Bike up First Avenue
p320
aVin my protected bike lane,
p321
aVand I looked over and I saw pedestrians
p322
aVstanding safely on the pedestrian islands,
p323
aVand the traffic was flowing,
p324
aVbirds were singing \u2014
p325
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p326
aVthe buses were speeding up their dedicated lanes.
p327
aVIt was just fantastic.
p328
aa(lp329
VAnd this is how it looked six years ago.
p330
aa(lp331
VAnd so, I think that the lesson that we have
p332
aVfrom New York is that it's possible
p333
aVto change your streets quickly,
p334
aVit's not expensive, it can provide immediate benefits,
p335
aVand it can be quite popular.
p336
aVYou just need to reimagine your streets.
p337
aVThey're hidden in plain sight.
p338
aa(lp339
VThank you.
