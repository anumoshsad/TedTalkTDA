VSo, I was in the hospital for a long time.
p4
aVAnd a few years after I left, I went back,
p5
aVand the chairman of the burn department was very excited to see me \u2014
p6
aVsaid, "Dan, I have a fantastic new treatment for you."
p7
aVI was very excited. I walked with him to his office.
p8
aVAnd he explained to me that, when I shave,
p9
aVI have little black dots on the left side of my face where the hair is,
p10
aVbut on the right side of my face
p11
aVI was badly burned so I have no hair,
p12
aVand this creates lack of symmetry.
p13
aVAnd what's the brilliant idea he had?
p14
aVHe was going to tattoo little black dots
p15
aVon the right side of my face
p16
aVand make me look very symmetric.
p17
aa(lp18
VIt sounded interesting. He asked me to go and shave.
p19
aVLet me tell you, this was a strange way to shave,
p20
aVbecause I thought about it
p21
aVand I realized that the way I was shaving then
p22
aVwould be the way I would shave for the rest of my life \u2014
p23
aVbecause I had to keep the width the same.
p24
aVWhen I got back to his office,
p25
aVI wasn't really sure.
p26
aVI said, "Can I see some evidence for this?"
p27
aVSo he showed me some pictures
p28
aVof little cheeks with little black dots \u2014
p29
aVnot very informative.
p30
aVI said, "What happens when I grow older and my hair becomes white?
p31
aVWhat would happen then?"
p32
aV"Oh, don't worry about it," he said.
p33
aV"We have lasers; we can whiten it out."
p34
aVBut I was still concerned,
p35
aVso I said, "You know what, I'm not going to do it."
p36
aa(lp37
VAnd then came one of the biggest guilt trips of my life.
p38
aVThis is coming from a Jewish guy, all right, so that means a lot.
p39
aV(Laughter)
p40
aVAnd he said, "Dan, what's wrong with you?
p41
aVDo you enjoy looking non-symmetric?
p42
aVDo you have some kind of perverted pleasure from this?
p43
aVDo women feel pity for you
p44
aVand have sex with you more frequently?"
p45
aVNone of those happened.
p46
aVAnd this was very surprising to me,
p47
aVbecause I've gone through many treatments \u2014
p48
aVthere were many treatments I decided not to do \u2014
p49
aVand I never got this guilt trip to this extent.
p50
aVBut I decided not to have this treatment.
p51
aVAnd I went to his deputy and asked him, "What was going on?
p52
aVWhere was this guilt trip coming from?"
p53
aVAnd he explained that they have done this procedure on two patients already,
p54
aVand they need the third patient for a paper they were writing.
p55
aa(lp56
V(Laughter)
p57
aa(lp58
VNow you probably think that this guy's a schmuck.
p59
aVRight, that's what he seems like.
p60
aVBut let me give you a different perspective on the same story.
p61
aVA few years ago, I was running some of my own experiments in the lab.
p62
aVAnd when we run experiments,
p63
aVwe usually hope that one group will behave differently than another.
p64
aVSo we had one group that I hoped their performance would be very high,
p65
aVanother group that I thought their performance would be very low,
p66
aVand when I got the results, that's what we got \u2014
p67
aVI was very happy \u2014 aside from one person.
p68
aVThere was one person in the group
p69
aVthat was supposed to have very high performance
p70
aVthat was actually performing terribly.
p71
aVAnd he pulled the whole mean down,
p72
aVdestroying my statistical significance of the test.
p73
aa(lp74
VSo I looked carefully at this guy.
p75
aVHe was 20-some years older than anybody else in the sample.
p76
aVAnd I remembered that the old and drunken guy
p77
aVcame one day to the lab
p78
aVwanting to make some easy cash
p79
aVand this was the guy.
p80
aV"Fantastic!" I thought. "Let's throw him out.
p81
aVWho would ever include a drunken guy in a sample?"
p82
aa(lp83
VBut a couple of days later,
p84
aVwe thought about it with my students,
p85
aVand we said, "What would have happened if this drunken guy was not in that condition?
p86
aVWhat would have happened if he was in the other group?
p87
aVWould we have thrown him out then?"
p88
aVWe probably wouldn't have looked at the data at all,
p89
aVand if we did look at the data,
p90
aVwe'd probably have said, "Fantastic! What a smart guy who is performing this low,"
p91
aVbecause he would have pulled the mean of the group lower,
p92
aVgiving us even stronger statistical results than we could.
p93
aVSo we decided not to throw the guy out and to rerun the experiment.
p94
aa(lp95
VBut you know, these stories,
p96
aVand lots of other experiments that we've done on conflicts of interest,
p97
aVbasically kind of bring two points
p98
aVto the foreground for me.
p99
aVThe first one is that in life we encounter many people
p100
aVwho, in some way or another,
p101
aVtry to tattoo our faces.
p102
aVThey just have the incentives that get them to be blinded to reality
p103
aVand give us advice that is inherently biased.
p104
aVAnd I'm sure that it's something that we all recognize,
p105
aVand we see that it happens.
p106
aVMaybe we don't recognize it every time,
p107
aVbut we understand that it happens.
p108
aa(lp109
VThe most difficult thing, of course, is to recognize
p110
aVthat sometimes we too
p111
aVare blinded by our own incentives.
p112
aVAnd that's a much, much more difficult lesson to take into account.
p113
aVBecause we don't see how conflicts of interest work on us.
p114
aVWhen I was doing these experiments,
p115
aVin my mind, I was helping science.
p116
aVI was eliminating the data
p117
aVto get the true pattern of the data to shine through.
p118
aVI wasn't doing something bad.
p119
aVIn my mind, I was actually a knight
p120
aVtrying to help science move along.
p121
aVBut this was not the case.
p122
aVI was actually interfering with the process with lots of good intentions.
p123
aVAnd I think the real challenge is to figure out
p124
aVwhere are the cases in our lives
p125
aVwhere conflicts of interest work on us,
p126
aVand try not to trust our own intuition to overcome it,
p127
aVbut to try to do things
p128
aVthat prevent us from falling prey to these behaviors,
p129
aVbecause we can create lots of undesirable circumstances.
p130
aa(lp131
VI do want to leave you with one positive thought.
p132
aVI mean, this is all very depressing, right \u2014
p133
aVpeople have conflicts of interest, we don't see it, and so on.
p134
aVThe positive perspective, I think, of all of this
p135
aVis that, if we do understand when we go wrong,
p136
aVif we understand the deep mechanisms
p137
aVof why we fail and where we fail,
p138
aVwe can actually hope to fix things.
p139
aVAnd that, I think, is the hope. Thank you very much.
