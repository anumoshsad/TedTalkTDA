VYeah, so a couple of years ago I was turning 60,
p4
aVand I don't like being 60.
p5
aV(Laughter)
p6
aVAnd I started grappling
p7
aVwith this existential angst
p8
aVof what little I had done with my life.
p9
aVIt wasn't the resume
p10
aVof breaking this record here,
p11
aVit was more like, who had I become?
p12
aVHow had I spent my valuable time?
p13
aVHow could this have gone by
p14
aVlike lightning?
p15
aVAnd I couldn't forgive myself
p16
aVfor the countless, countless hours
p17
aVI had lost
p18
aVin negative thought \u2014
p19
aVall the time I had spent beating myself up
p20
aVfor losing my marriage
p21
aVand not stopping the sexual abuse when I was a kid
p22
aVand career moves
p23
aVand this and this and this.
p24
aVJust why, why didn't I do it better? Why? Why? Why?
p25
aVAnd then my mother died at 82.
p26
aVAnd so I starting thinking,
p27
aVnot only am I not happy with the past,
p28
aVnow I'm getting choked with,
p29
aV"I've only got 22 years left."
p30
aVWhat am I going to do with this short amount of time
p31
aVthat's just fleeting?
p32
aVAnd I'm not in the present whatsoever.
p33
aa(lp34
VAnd I decided the remedy to all this malaise
p35
aVwas going to be
p36
aVfor me to chase
p37
aVan elevated dream,
p38
aVan extreme dream,
p39
aVsomething that would require
p40
aVutter conviction
p41
aVand unwavering passion,
p42
aVsomething that would make me
p43
aVbe my best self
p44
aVin every aspect of my life,
p45
aVevery minute of every day,
p46
aVbecause the dream was so big
p47
aVthat I couldn't get there
p48
aVwithout that kind of behavior and that kind of conviction.
p49
aVAnd I decided,
p50
aVit was an old dream that was lingering,
p51
aVthat was from so many years ago,
p52
aVthree decades ago \u2014
p53
aVthe only sort of world class swim
p54
aVI had tried and failed at back in my 20s \u2014
p55
aVwas going from Cuba to Florida.
p56
aVIt was deep in my imagination.
p57
aa(lp58
VNo one's ever done it without a shark cage.
p59
aVIt's daunting.
p60
aVIt's more than a hundred miles across a difficult passage of ocean.
p61
aVIt's probably, at my speed, at my age \u2014
p62
aVfor anybody's speed at anybody's age \u2014
p63
aVgoing to take 60, maybe 70, hours
p64
aVof continuous swimming,
p65
aVnever getting out on the boat.
p66
aa(lp67
VAnd I started to train.
p68
aVI hadn't swum for 31 years, not a stroke.
p69
aVAnd I had kept in good shape, but swimming's a whole different animal.
p70
aVAs a matter of fact,
p71
aVthis picture is supposed to be me during training.
p72
aVIt's a smiling face.
p73
aVAnd when you're training for this sport, you are not smiling.
p74
aV(Laughter)
p75
aVIt's an arduous, difficult sport,
p76
aVand I don't remember smiling
p77
aVat any time during this sport.
p78
aVAs I said, I respect other sports,
p79
aVand I compare this sport sometimes
p80
aVto cycling and to mountain climbing
p81
aVand other of the expedition type events,
p82
aVbut this is a sensory deprivation,
p83
aVa physical duress.
p84
aVAnd when I started in
p85
aVwith the eight hours and the 10 hours and the 12 hours
p86
aVand the 14 hours and the 15 hours and the 24-hour swims,
p87
aVI knew I had it,
p88
aVbecause I was making it through these.
p89
aa(lp90
VAnd when I said I'm going to go out and do a 15-hour swim,
p91
aVand we're coming into the dock after a long day
p92
aVand it's now night,
p93
aVand we come in and it's 14 hours and 58 minutes
p94
aVand I can touch the dock and we're done,
p95
aVthe trainer says, "That's great.
p96
aVIt's 14 hours 58 minutes. Who cares the last two minutes?"
p97
aVI say, "No, it's got to be 15 hours,"
p98
aVand I swim another minute out and another minute back
p99
aVto make the 15 hours.
p100
aa(lp101
VAnd I put together an expedition.
p102
aVIt's not that I didn't have help,
p103
aVbut honestly, I sort of led, I was the team leader.
p104
aVAnd to get the government permissions,
p105
aVyou read in the paper,
p106
aVyou think it's easy to get into Cuba everyday?
p107
aVTry going in with an armada like we had
p108
aVof 50 people and five boats
p109
aVand CNN's crew, etc.
p110
aVThe navigation is difficult.
p111
aVThere's a big river called the Gulf Stream
p112
aVthat runs across
p113
aVand it's not going in the direction you are.
p114
aVIt's going to the east and you'd like to go north.
p115
aVIt's tricky.
p116
aVAnd there's dehydration.
p117
aVAnd there's hypothermia.
p118
aVAnd there are sharks.
p119
aVAnd there are all kinds of problems.
p120
aVAnd I gathered together, honestly,
p121
aVthe world's leading experts in every possible way.
p122
aa(lp123
VAnd a month ago,
p124
aVthe 23rd of September,
p125
aVI stood on that shore
p126
aVand I looked across
p127
aVto that long, long faraway horizon
p128
aVand I asked myself,
p129
aVdo you have it?
p130
aVAre your shoulders ready?
p131
aVAnd they were. They were prepared.
p132
aVNo stone left unturned.
p133
aVWas the mind ready?
p134
aVYou know, you're swimming with the fogged goggles,
p135
aVyou're swimming at 60 strokes a minute,
p136
aVso you're never really focused on anything, you don't see well.
p137
aVYou've got tight bathing caps over your ears
p138
aVtrying to keep the heat of the head,
p139
aVbecause it's where the hypothermia starts,
p140
aVand so you don't hear very well.
p141
aVYou're really left alone with your own thoughts.
p142
aVAnd I had all kinds of counting systems ready there
p143
aVin English, followed by German,
p144
aVfollowed by Spanish, followed by French.
p145
aVYou save the French for last.
p146
aa(lp147
VAnd I had songs, I had a playlist in my head \u2014
p148
aVnot through headphones, in my own head \u2014
p149
aVof 65 songs.
p150
aVAnd I couldn't wait to get into the dark in the middle of the night,
p151
aVbecause that's when Neil Young comes out.
p152
aV(Laughter)
p153
aVAnd it's odd, isn't it?
p154
aVYou'd think you'd be singing Leonard Cohen's "Hallelujah"
p155
aVout in the majesty of the ocean,
p156
aVnot songs about heroin addiction in New York City.
p157
aVBut no, for some reason
p158
aVI couldn't wait to get into the dark of the night
p159
aVand be singing,
p160
aV\u266b "A heard you knocking at my cellar door \u266b
p161
aV\u266b I love you baby and I want some more \u266b
p162
aV\u266b Ooh, ooh, the damage done" \u266b
p163
aa(lp164
V(Applause)
p165
aa(lp166
VThe night before I started,
p167
aVI finished Stephen Hawking's "The Grand Design."
p168
aVAnd I couldn't wait
p169
aVto trip the mind fantastic.
p170
aVAbout the 50th hour,
p171
aVI was going to start thinking about the edge of the universe.
p172
aVIs there an edge?
p173
aVIs this an envelope we're living inside of,
p174
aVor no, does it go onto infinity in both time and space?
p175
aVAnd there's nothing like swimming for 50 hours in the ocean
p176
aVthat gets you thinking about things like this.
p177
aVI couldn't wait to prove the athlete I am,
p178
aVthat nobody else in the world can do this swim.
p179
aVAnd I knew I could do it.
p180
aa(lp181
VAnd when I jumped into that water,
p182
aVI yelled in my mother's French, "Courage!"
p183
aVAnd I started swimming,
p184
aVand, oh my God, it was glassy.
p185
aVAnd we knew it, all 50 people on the boat,
p186
aVwe all knew this was it,
p187
aVthis was our time.
p188
aVAnd I reminded myself a couple hours in,
p189
aVyou know, the sport is sort of a microcosm of life itself.
p190
aVFirst of all, you're going to hit obstacles.
p191
aVAnd even though you're feeling great at any one moment,
p192
aVdon't take it for granted, be ready,
p193
aVbecause there's going to be pain, there's going to be suffering.
p194
aVIt's not going to feel this good all the way across.
p195
aVAnd I was thinking of the hypothermia
p196
aVand maybe some shoulder pain
p197
aVand all the other things \u2014
p198
aVthe vomiting that comes from being in the saltwater.
p199
aVYou're immersed in the liquid.
p200
aVYour body doesn't like the saltwater.
p201
aVAfter a couple of days, three days,
p202
aVyou tend to rebel
p203
aVin a lot of physical ways.
p204
aa(lp205
VBut no, two hours in,
p206
aVwham! Never in my life ...
p207
aVI knew there were Portuguese men o' war,
p208
aVall kinds of moon jellies, all kinds of things,
p209
aVbut the box jellyfish from the southern oceans
p210
aVis not supposed to be in these waters.
p211
aVAnd I was on fire \u2014
p212
aVexcruciating, excruciating pain.
p213
aVI don't know if you can still see
p214
aVthe red line here and up the arm.
p215
aVEvidently, a piece this big of tentacle
p216
aVhas a hundred-thousand little barbs on it
p217
aVand each barb is not just stinging your skin,
p218
aVit's sending a venom.
p219
aVThe most venomous animal that lives in the ocean
p220
aVis the box jellyfish.
p221
aVAnd every one of those barbs
p222
aVis sending that venom into this central nervous system.
p223
aVSo first I feel like boiling hot oil,
p224
aVI've been dipped in.
p225
aVAnd I'm yelling out, "Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire!
p226
aVHelp me! Somebody help me!"
p227
aVAnd the next thing is paralysis.
p228
aVI feel it in the back and then I feel it in the chest up here,
p229
aVand I can't breathe.
p230
aVAnd now I'm not swimming with a nice long stroke,
p231
aVI'm sort of crabbing it this way.
p232
aVThen come convulsions.
p233
aa(lp234
VA young man on our boat is an EMT. He dives in to try to help me.
p235
aVHe's stung.
p236
aVThey drag him out on the boat,
p237
aVand he's \u2014 evidently, I didn't see any of this \u2014 but lying on the boat
p238
aVand giving himself epinephrine shots
p239
aVand crying out.
p240
aVHe's 29 years old,
p241
aVvery well-built, lean, he's six-foot, five,
p242
aVweighs 265 lbs.,
p243
aVand he is down.
p244
aVAnd he is crying and he's yelling to my trainer
p245
aVwho's trying to help me.
p246
aVAnd he's saying, "Bonnie, I think I'm going to die.
p247
aVMy breath is down to three breaths a minute.
p248
aVI need help, and I can't help Diana."
p249
aa(lp250
VSo that was at eight o'clock at night.
p251
aVThe doctor, medical team from University of Miami
p252
aVarrived at five in the morning.
p253
aVSo I swam through the night,
p254
aVand at dawn they got there and they started with prednisone shots.
p255
aVI didn't get out,
p256
aVbut was in the water taking prednisone shots, taking Xanax,
p257
aVoxygen to the face.
p258
aVIt was like an ICU unit
p259
aVin the water.
p260
aV(Laughter)
p261
aVAnd I guess the story is
p262
aVthat even Navy SEALS who are stung by the box jelly,
p263
aVthey're done.
p264
aVThey either die or they quickly get to a hospital.
p265
aa(lp266
VAnd I swam through the night and I swam through the next day.
p267
aVAnd the next night at dusk,
p268
aVagain, wham!
p269
aVThe box jelly again \u2014
p270
aVall across the neck, all across here.
p271
aVAnd this time,
p272
aVI don't like it, I didn't want to give into it,
p273
aVbut there's a difference between a non-stop swim
p274
aVand a staged swim.
p275
aVAnd I gave in
p276
aVto the staged swim.
p277
aVAnd they got me out and they started again
p278
aVwith the epinephrine and the prednisone
p279
aVand with the oxygen and with everything they had on board.
p280
aVAnd I got back in.
p281
aVAnd I swam through that night and into the next day.
p282
aVAnd at 41 hours,
p283
aVthis body couldn't make it.
p284
aVThe devastation of those stings
p285
aVhad taken the respiratory system down
p286
aVso that I couldn't make the progress I wanted.
p287
aVAnd the dream was crushed.
p288
aa(lp289
VAnd how odd
p290
aVis this intelligent person who put this together
p291
aVand got all these world experts together.
p292
aVAnd I knew about the jellyfish,
p293
aVbut I was sort of cavalier.
p294
aVA lot of athletes have this, you know,
p295
aVsort of invincibility.
p296
aVThey should worry about me. I don't worry about them.
p297
aVI'll just swim right through them.
p298
aVWe've got benadryl on board. If I get stung, I'll just grin and bear it.
p299
aVWell there was no grin and bearing this.
p300
aa(lp301
VAs a matter of fact, the best advice I got
p302
aVwas from an elementary school class
p303
aVin the Caribbean.
p304
aVAnd I was telling these kids, 120 of them \u2014
p305
aVthey were all in the school on the gymnasium floor \u2014
p306
aVand I was telling them about the jellyfish
p307
aVand how they're gelatinous
p308
aVand you can't see them at night especially.
p309
aVAnd they have these
p310
aVlong 30 to 40 to 50-ft. tentacles.
p311
aVAnd they do this wrapping.
p312
aVAnd they can send the poison into the system.
p313
aa(lp314
VAnd a little kid from the back was like this.
p315
aVAnd I said, "What's your name?" "Henry."
p316
aV"Henry, what's your question?"
p317
aVHe said, "Well, I didn't have a question so much
p318
aVas I had a suggestion."
p319
aVHe said, "You know those guys
p320
aVwho really believe in what they believe in
p321
aVand so they wear bombs?"
p322
aVAnd I said, "Well it's odd that you've learned of this
p323
aVas a noble kind of pursuit, but yeah, I know those guys."
p324
aVHe said, "That's what you need.
p325
aVYou need like a school of fish
p326
aVthat would swim in front of you like this."
p327
aV(Laughter)
p328
aV"And when the jellyfish come and they wrap their tentacles around the fish,
p329
aVthey're going to be busy with them,
p330
aVand you'll just scoot around."
p331
aVI said, "Oh, it's like a suicide army."
p332
aVHe said, "That's what I'm talking about. That's what you need."
p333
aa(lp334
VAnd little did I know,
p335
aVthat you should listen to eight year-olds.
p336
aVAnd so I started that swim
p337
aVin a bathing suit like normal,
p338
aVand, no joke, this is it; it came from the shark divers.
p339
aVI finished the swim like this.
p340
aVI was swimming with this thing on.
p341
aVThat's how scared of the jellyfish I was.
p342
aa(lp343
VSo now what do I do?
p344
aVI wouldn't mind
p345
aVif every one of you came up on this stage tonight
p346
aVand told us how you've gotten over the big disappointments of your lives.
p347
aVBecause we've all had them, haven't we?
p348
aVWe've all had a heartache.
p349
aVAnd so my journey now
p350
aVis to find some sort of grace
p351
aVin the face of this defeat.
p352
aVAnd I can look at the journey,
p353
aVnot just the destination.
p354
aVI can feel proud. I can stand here in front of you tonight
p355
aVand say I was courageous.
p356
aVYeah.
p357
aa(lp358
V(Applause)
p359
aa(lp360
VThank you.
p361
aa(lp362
VAnd with all sincerity, I can say,
p363
aVI am glad I lived those two years of my life that way,
p364
aVbecause my goal to not suffer regrets anymore,
p365
aVI got there with that goal.
p366
aVWhen you live that way, when you live with that kind of passion,
p367
aVthere's no time, there's no time for regrets,
p368
aVyou're just moving forward.
p369
aVAnd I want to live every day of the rest of my life that way,
p370
aVswim or no swim.
p371
aVBut the difference
p372
aVin accepting this particular defeat
p373
aVis that sometimes,
p374
aVif cancer has won,
p375
aVif there's death and we have no choice,
p376
aVthen grace and acceptance
p377
aVare necessary.
p378
aa(lp379
VBut that ocean's still there.
p380
aVThis hope is still alive.
p381
aVAnd I don't want to be the crazy woman
p382
aVwho does it for years and years and years,
p383
aVand tries and fails and tries and fails and tries and fails,
p384
aVbut I can swim from Cuba to Florida,
p385
aVand I will swim from Cuba to Florida.
p386
aa(lp387
VThank you.
p388
aVThank you.
p389
aa(lp390
V(Applause)
p391
aa(lp392
VThank you.
p393
aa(lp394
V(Applause)
p395
aa(lp396
VAnd so, what after that?
p397
aVAre you going to swim the Atlantic?
p398
aVNo, that's the last swim.
p399
aVIt's the only swim I'm interested in.
p400
aVBut I'm ready.
p401
aVAnd by the way, a reporter called me the other day
p402
aVand he said he looked on Wikipedia
p403
aVand he said he saw my birthday was August 22nd 1949,
p404
aVand for some odd reason in Wikipedia,
p405
aVthey had my death date too.
p406
aV(Laughter)
p407
aVHe said, "Did you know you're going to die the same place you were born, New York City,
p408
aVand it's going to be in January of '35?"
p409
aVI said, "Nope. I didn't know."
p410
aVAnd now I'm going to live to 85.
p411
aVI have three more years than I thought.
p412
aa(lp413
VAnd so I ask myself,
p414
aVI'm starting to ask myself now,
p415
aVeven before this extreme dream
p416
aVgets achieved for me,
p417
aVI'm asking myself,
p418
aVand maybe I can ask you tonight too,
p419
aVto paraphrase the poet
p420
aVMary Oliver,
p421
aVshe says, "So what is it,
p422
aVwhat is it you're doing,
p423
aVwith this one wild and precious life of yours?"
p424
aa(lp425
VThank you very much.
p426
aa(lp427

p428
aa(lp429
VThank you. Thank you.
