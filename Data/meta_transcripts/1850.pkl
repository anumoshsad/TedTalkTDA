VI've spent my life working on sustainability.
p4
aVI set up a climate change NGO
p5
aVcalled The Climate Group.
p6
aVI worked on forestry issues in WWF.
p7
aVI worked on development and agriculture issues
p8
aVin the U.N. system.
p9
aVAbout 25 years in total,
p10
aVand then three years ago, I found myself talking to
p11
aVIKEA's CEO about joining his team.
p12
aVLike many people here, well,
p13
aVI want to maximize my personal impact in the world,
p14
aVso I'm going to explain why I joined the team there.
p15
aa(lp16
VBut first, let's just take three numbers.
p17
aa(lp18
VThe first number is three:
p19
aVthree billion people.
p20
aVThis is the number of people joining
p21
aVthe global middle class by 2030,
p22
aVcoming out of poverty.
p23
aVIt's fantastic for them and their families,
p24
aVbut we've got two billion people in the global middle class today,
p25
aVand this swells that number to five,
p26
aVa big challenge when we already have resource scarcity.
p27
aa(lp28
VThe second number is six:
p29
aVThis is six degrees centigrade,
p30
aVwhat we're heading towards in terms of global warming.
p31
aVWe're not heading towards one degree or three degrees
p32
aVor four degrees, we're heading toward six degrees.
p33
aVAnd if you think about it, all of the weird weather
p34
aVwe've been having the last few years,
p35
aVmuch of that is due to just one degree warming,
p36
aVand we need CO2 emissions to peak
p37
aVby the end of this decade globally
p38
aVand then come down.
p39
aVIt's not inevitable, but we need to act decisively.
p40
aa(lp41
VThe third number is 12:
p42
aVThat's the number of cities in the world
p43
aVthat had a million or more people
p44
aVwhen my grandmother was born.
p45
aVYou can see my grandmother there.
p46
aVThat was in the beginning of the last century.
p47
aVSo just 12 cities. She was born in Manchester, England,
p48
aVthe ninth largest city in the world.
p49
aVNow there are 500 cities, nearly,
p50
aVwith a million people or more in them.
p51
aVAnd if you look at the century from 1950 to 2050,
p52
aVthat's the century when we build all the world's cities,
p53
aVthe century that we're in the middle of right now.
p54
aVEvery other century was kind of practice,
p55
aVand this lays down a blueprint for how we live.
p56
aa(lp57
VSo think about it.
p58
aVWe're building cities like never before,
p59
aVbringing people out of poverty like never before,
p60
aVand changing the climate like never before.
p61
aVSustainability has gone from a nice-to-do
p62
aVto a must-do.
p63
aVit's about what we do right here, right now,
p64
aVand for the rest of our working lives.
p65
aa(lp66
VSo I'm going to talk a little bit about
p67
aVwhat business can do
p68
aVand what a business like IKEA can do,
p69
aVand we have a sustainability strategy
p70
aVcalled "people and planet positive"
p71
aVto help guide our business to have a positive impact on the world.
p72
aVWhy would we not want to have a positive impact
p73
aVon the world as a business?
p74
aVOther companies have sustainability strategies.
p75
aVI'm going to refer to some of those as well,
p76
aVand I'm just going to mention a few
p77
aVof the commitments as illustrations that we've got.
p78
aa(lp79
VBut first, let's think of customers.
p80
aVWe know from asking people from China to the U.S.
p81
aVthat the vast majority of people care about sustainability
p82
aVafter the day-to-day issues,
p83
aVthe day-to-day issues of, how do I get my kids to school?
p84
aVCan I pay the bills at the end of the month?
p85
aVThen they care about big issues like climate change.
p86
aVBut they want it to be easy, affordable and attractive,
p87
aVand they expect business to help,
p88
aVand they're a little bit disappointed today.
p89
aa(lp90
VSo take your mind back and think
p91
aVof the first sustainable products.
p92
aVWe had detergents that could wash your whites grayer.
p93
aVWe had the early energy-efficient light bulbs
p94
aVthat took five minutes to warm up
p95
aVand then you were left looking a kind of sickly color.
p96
aVAnd we had the rough, recycled toilet paper.
p97
aVSo every time you pulled on a t-shirt,
p98
aVor switched the light on, or went to the bathroom,
p99
aVor sometimes all three together,
p100
aVyou were reminded sustainability was about compromise.
p101
aVIt wasn't a great start.
p102
aa(lp103
VToday we have choices.
p104
aVWe can make products that are beautiful or ugly,
p105
aVsustainable or unsustainable, affordable or expensive,
p106
aVfunctional or useless.
p107
aVSo let's make beautiful, functional, affordable,
p108
aVsustainable products.
p109
aa(lp110
VLet's take the LED.
p111
aVThe LED is the next best thing to daylight.
p112
aVThe old-fashioned lightbulbs, the incandescent bulbs \u2014
p113
aVI'm not going to ask for a show of hands
p114
aVof how many of you still have them in your homes,
p115
aVwasting energy every time you switch them on \u2014
p116
aVchange them after this \u2014
p117
aVor whether we have them on the stage here at TED or not \u2014
p118
aVbut those old incandescent light bulbs
p119
aVreally should have been sold as heaters.
p120
aVThey were mis-sold for more than a hundred years.
p121
aVThey produced heat and a little bit of light on the side.
p122
aVNow we have lights that produce light
p123
aVand a little bit of heat on the side.
p124
aVYou save 85 percent of the electricity with an LED
p125
aVthat you would have done in an old incandescent.
p126
aVAnd the best thing is, they'll also last
p127
aVfor more than 20 years.
p128
aVSo think about that.
p129
aVYou'll change your smartphone seven or eight times,
p130
aVprobably more if you're in this audience.
p131
aVYou'll change your car, if you have one, three or four times.
p132
aVYour kids could go to school, go to college,
p133
aVgo away and have kids of their own, come back,
p134
aVbring the grandkids,
p135
aVyou'll have the same lightbulb saving you energy.
p136
aVSo LEDs are fantastic.
p137
aVWhat we decided to do
p138
aVwas not to sell LEDs on the side marked up high
p139
aVand continue to push all the old bulbs,
p140
aVthe halogens and the CFLs.
p141
aVWe decided, over the next two years,
p142
aVwe will ban the halogens and the CFLs ourselves.
p143
aVWe will go all in.
p144
aVAnd this is what business needs to do: go all-in,
p145
aVgo 100 percent,
p146
aVbecause then you stop investing in the old stuff,
p147
aVyou invest in the new stuff, you lower costs,
p148
aVyou use your supply chain and your creativity
p149
aVand you get the prices down so everybody can afford
p150
aVthe best lights so they can save energy.
p151
aa(lp152
V(Applause)
p153
aa(lp154
VIt's not just about products in people's homes.
p155
aVWe've got to think about the raw materials
p156
aVthat produce our products.
p157
aVObviously there's fantastic opportunities
p158
aVwith recycled materials,
p159
aVand we can and will go zero waste.
p160
aVAnd there's opportunities in a circular economy.
p161
aVBut we're still dependent on natural, raw materials.
p162
aVLet's take cotton.
p163
aVCotton's brilliant. Probably many people
p164
aVare wearing cotton right now.
p165
aVIt's a brilliant textile in use.
p166
aVIt's really dirty in production.
p167
aVIt uses lots of pesticides, lots of fertilizer, lots of water.
p168
aVSo we've worked with others,
p169
aVwith other businesses and NGOs,
p170
aVon the Better Cotton Initiative,
p171
aVworking right back down to the farm,
p172
aVand there you can halve the amount of water
p173
aVand halve the chemical inputs,
p174
aVthe yields increase, and 60 percent of the costs
p175
aVof running many of these farms
p176
aVwith farmers with low incomes
p177
aVcan be chemical imports.
p178
aVYields increase, and you halve the input costs.
p179
aVFarmers are coming out of poverty. They love it.
p180
aVAlready hundreds of thousands of farmers
p181
aVhave been reached,
p182
aVand now we've got 60 percent better cotton in our business.
p183
aVAgain, we're going all-in.
p184
aVBy 2015, we'll be 100 percent Better Cotton.
p185
aa(lp186
VTake the topic of 100 percent targets, actually.
p187
aVPeople sometimes think that
p188
aV100 percent's going to be hard,
p189
aVand we've had the conversation in the business.
p190
aVActually, we found 100 percent is easier to do
p191
aVthan 90 percent or 50 percent.
p192
aVIf you have a 90 percent target,
p193
aVeveryone in the business finds a reason
p194
aVto be in the 10 percent.
p195
aVWhen it's 100 percent, it's kind of clear,
p196
aVand businesspeople like clarity,
p197
aVbecause then you just get the job done.
p198
aa(lp199
VSo, wood. We know with forestry, it's a choice.
p200
aVYou've got illegal logging
p201
aVand deforestation still on a very large scale,
p202
aVor you can have fantastic, responsible forestry
p203
aVthat we can be proud of.
p204
aVIt's a simple choice, so we've worked
p205
aVfor many years with the Forest Stewardship Council,
p206
aVwith literally hundreds of other organizations,
p207
aVand there's a point here about collaboration.
p208
aVSo hundreds of others, of NGOs,
p209
aVof forest workers' unions, and of businesses,
p210
aVhave helped create the Forest Stewardship Council,
p211
aVwhich sets standards for forestry
p212
aVand then checks the forestry's good on the ground.
p213
aVNow together, through our supply chain,
p214
aVwith partners, we've managed to certify
p215
aV35 million hectares of forestry.
p216
aVThat's about the size of Germany.
p217
aVAnd we've decided in the next three years,
p218
aVwe will double the volume of certified material
p219
aVwe put through our business.
p220
aVSo be decisive on these issues.
p221
aVUse your supply chain to drive good.
p222
aa(lp223
VBut then it comes to your operations.
p224
aVSome things are certain, I think.
p225
aVWe know we'll use electricity in 20 or 30 years' time.
p226
aVWe know the sun will be shining somewhere,
p227
aVand the wind will still be blowing in 20 or 30 years' time.
p228
aVSo why not make our energy out of the sun and the wind?
p229
aVAnd why not take control of it ourselves?
p230
aVSo we're going 100 percent renewable.
p231
aVBy 2020, we'll produce more renewable energy
p232
aVthan the energy we consume as a business.
p233
aVFor all of our stores, our own factories,
p234
aVour distribution centers,
p235
aVwe've installed 300,000 solar panels so far,
p236
aVand we've got 14 wind farms we own and operate
p237
aVin six countries, and we're not done yet.
p238
aVBut think of a solar panel.
p239
aVA solar panel pays for itself in seven or eight years.
p240
aVThe electricity is free.
p241
aVEvery time the sun comes out after that,
p242
aVthe electricity is free.
p243
aVSo this is a good thing for the CFO,
p244
aVnot just the sustainability guy.
p245
aVEvery business can do things like this.
p246
aa(lp247
VBut then we've got to look beyond our operations,
p248
aVand I think everybody would agree
p249
aVthat now business has to take full responsibility
p250
aVfor the impacts of your supply chain.
p251
aVMany businesses now, fortunately,
p252
aVhave codes of conduct and audit their supply chains,
p253
aVbut not every business. Far from it.
p254
aVAnd this came in IKEA actually in the '90s.
p255
aVWe found there was a risk
p256
aVof child labor in the supply chain,
p257
aVand people in the business were shocked.
p258
aVAnd it was clearly totally unacceptable, so then you have to act.
p259
aVSo a code of conduct was developed,
p260
aVand now we have 80 auditors out in the world
p261
aVevery day making sure all our factories
p262
aVsecure good working conditions
p263
aVand protect human rights
p264
aVand make sure there is no child labor.
p265
aa(lp266
VBut it's not just as simple as making sure
p267
aVthere's no child labor.
p268
aVYou've got to say that's not enough today.
p269
aVI think we'd all agree that children
p270
aVare the most important people in the world
p271
aVand the most vulnerable.
p272
aVSo what can a business do today
p273
aVto actually use your total value chain
p274
aVto support a better quality of life
p275
aVand protect child rights?
p276
aVWe've worked with UNICEF and Save the Children
p277
aVon developing some new business principles
p278
aVwith children's rights.
p279
aVIncreasing numbers of businesses
p280
aVare signing up to these,
p281
aVbut actually in a survey, many business leaders
p282
aVsaid they thought their business had nothing to do with children.
p283
aVSo what we decided to do was, we will look
p284
aVand ask ourselves the tough questions
p285
aVwith partners who know more than us,
p286
aVwhat can we do to go beyond our business
p287
aVto help improve the lives of children?
p288
aVWe also have a foundation
p289
aVthat's committed to work through partners
p290
aVand help improve the lives and protect the rights
p291
aVof 100 million children by 2015.
p292
aa(lp293
VYou know the phrase,
p294
aVyou can manage what you measure?
p295
aVWell, you should measure what you care about.
p296
aVIf you're not measuring things,
p297
aVyou don't care and you don't know.
p298
aVSo let's take an example, measure the things
p299
aVthat are important in your business.
p300
aVIsn't it about time that businesses
p301
aVwere led equally by men and women?
p302
aa(lp303
V(Applause)
p304
aa(lp305
VSo we know for our 17,000 managers across IKEA
p306
aVthat 47 percent are women today,
p307
aVbut it's not enough, and we want to close the gap
p308
aVand follow it all the way through to senior management.
p309
aVAnd we do not want to wait another hundred years.
p310
aVSo we've launched a women's open network
p311
aVthis week in IKEA,
p312
aVand we'll do whatever it takes to lead the change.
p313
aVSo the message here is,
p314
aVmeasure what you care about and lead the change,
p315
aVand don't wait a hundred years.
p316
aa(lp317
VSo we've gone from sustainability
p318
aVbeing a nice-to-do to a must-do. It's a must-do.
p319
aVIt's still nice to do, but it's a must-do.
p320
aVAnd everybody can do something on this as an individual.
p321
aVBe a discerning consumer.
p322
aVVote with your wallets.
p323
aVSearch out the companies
p324
aVthat are acting on this.
p325
aVBut also, there are other businesses already acting.
p326
aVI mentioned renewable energy.
p327
aVYou go to Google or Lego,
p328
aVthey're going 100 percent renewable too,
p329
aVin the same way that we are.
p330
aVOn having really good sustainability strategies,
p331
aVthere are companies like Nike, Patagonia,
p332
aVTimberland, Marks & Spencer.
p333
aVBut I don't think any of those businesses would say
p334
aVthey're perfect. We certainly wouldn't.
p335
aVWe'll make mistakes going forward,
p336
aVbut it's about setting a clear direction, being transparent,
p337
aVhaving a dialogue with the right partners,
p338
aVand choosing to lead on the issues that really count.
p339
aa(lp340
VSo if you're a business leader,
p341
aVif you're not already weaving sustainability
p342
aVright into the heart of your business model,
p343
aVI'd urge you to do so.
p344
aVAnd together, we can help create
p345
aVa sustainable world,
p346
aVand, if we get it right,
p347
aVwe can make sustainability
p348
aVaffordable for the many people,
p349
aVnot a luxury for the few.
p350
aa(lp351
VThank you.
