VHave you heard the news?
p4
aVWe're in a clean energy revolution.
p5
aVAnd where I live in Berkeley, California,
p6
aVit seems like every day I see a new roof with new solar panels going up,
p7
aVelectric car in the driveway.
p8
aVGermany sometimes gets half its power from solar,
p9
aVand India is now committed to building 10 times more solar
p10
aVthan we have in California,
p11
aVby the year 2022.
p12
aa(lp13
VEven nuclear seems to be making a comeback.
p14
aVBill Gates is in China working with engineers,
p15
aVthere's 40 different companies that are working together
p16
aVto try to race to build the first reactor that runs on waste,
p17
aVthat can't melt down
p18
aVand is cheaper than coal.
p19
aVAnd so you might start to ask:
p20
aVIs this whole global warming problem
p21
aVgoing to be a lot easier to solve than anybody imagined?
p22
aVThat was the question we wanted to know,
p23
aVso my colleagues and I decided to take a deep dive into the data.
p24
aVWe were a little skeptical of some parts
p25
aVof the clean energy revolution story,
p26
aVbut what we found really surprised us.
p27
aa(lp28
VThe first thing is that clean energy has been increasing.
p29
aVThis is electricity from clean energy sources over the last 20 years.
p30
aVBut when you look at the percentage of global electricity
p31
aVfrom clean energy sources,
p32
aVit's actually been in decline from 36 percent to 31 percent.
p33
aVAnd if you care about climate change,
p34
aVyou've got to go in the opposite direction
p35
aVto 100 percent of our electricity from clean energy sources,
p36
aVas quickly as possible.
p37
aVNow, you might wonder,
p38
aV"Come on, how much could five percentage points of global electricity be?"
p39
aVWell, it turns out to be quite a bit.
p40
aVIt's the equivalent of 60 nuclear plants
p41
aVthe size of Diablo Canyon, California's last nuclear plant,
p42
aVor 900 solar farms the size of Topaz,
p43
aVwhich is one of the biggest solar farms in the world,
p44
aVand certainly our biggest in California.
p45
aVA big part of this is simply that fossil fuels are increasing
p46
aVfaster than clean energy.
p47
aVAnd that's understandable.
p48
aVThere's just a lot of poor countries
p49
aVthat are still using wood and dung and charcoal
p50
aVas their main source of energy,
p51
aVand they need modern fuels.
p52
aa(lp53
VBut there's something else going on,
p54
aVwhich is that one of those clean energy sources in particular
p55
aVhas actually been on the decline in absolute terms,
p56
aVnot just relatively.
p57
aVAnd that's nuclear.
p58
aVYou can see its generation has declined seven percent
p59
aVover the last 10 years.
p60
aVNow, solar and wind have been making huge strides,
p61
aVso you hear a lot of talk about how it doesn't really matter,
p62
aVbecause solar and wind is going to make up the difference.
p63
aVBut the data says something different.
p64
aVWhen you combine all the electricity from solar and wind,
p65
aVyou see it actually barely makes up half of the decline from nuclear.
p66
aVLet's take a closer look in the United States.
p67
aa(lp68
VOver the last couple of years \u2014 really 2013, 2014 \u2014
p69
aVwe prematurely retired four nuclear power plants.
p70
aVThey were almost entirely replaced with fossil fuels,
p71
aVand so the consequence was that we wiped out
p72
aValmost as much clean energy electricity that we get from solar.
p73
aVAnd it's not unique to us.
p74
aVPeople think of California as a clean energy and climate leader,
p75
aVbut when we looked at the data,
p76
aVwhat we found is that, in fact,
p77
aVCalifornia reduced emissions more slowly than the national average,
p78
aVbetween 2000 and 2015.
p79
aa(lp80
VWhat about Germany?
p81
aVThey're doing a lot of clean energy.
p82
aVBut when you look at the data,
p83
aVGerman emissions have actually been going up since 2009,
p84
aVand there's really not anybody who's going to tell you
p85
aVthat they're going to meet their climate commitments in 2020.
p86
aa(lp87
VThe reason isn't hard to understand.
p88
aVSolar and wind provide power about 10 to 20 percent of the time,
p89
aVwhich means that when the sun's not shining,
p90
aVthe wind's not blowing,
p91
aVyou still need power for your hospitals,
p92
aVyour homes, your cities, your factories.
p93
aVAnd while batteries have made some really cool improvements lately,
p94
aVthe truth is, they're just never going to be as efficient
p95
aVas the electrical grid.
p96
aVEvery time you put electricity into a battery and take it out,
p97
aVyou lose about 20 to 40 percent of the power.
p98
aVThat's why when, in California,
p99
aVwe try to deal with all the solar we've brought online \u2014
p100
aVwe now get about 10 percent of electricity from solar \u2014
p101
aVwhen the sun goes down, and people come home from work
p102
aVand turn on their air conditioners and their TV sets,
p103
aVand every other appliance in the house,
p104
aVwe need a lot of natural gas backup.
p105
aVSo what we've been doing
p106
aVis stuffing a lot of natural gas into the side of a mountain.
p107
aVAnd that worked pretty well for a while,
p108
aVbut then late last year, it sprung a leak.
p109
aVThis is Aliso Canyon.
p110
aVSo much methane gas was released,
p111
aVit was the equivalent of putting half a million cars on the road.
p112
aVIt basically blew through all of our climate commitments for the year.
p113
aa(lp114
VWell, what about India?
p115
aVSometimes you have to go places to really get the right data,
p116
aVso we traveled to India a few months ago.
p117
aVWe met with all the top officials \u2014 solar, nuclear, the rest \u2014
p118
aVand what they told us is,
p119
aV"We're actually having more serious problems
p120
aVthan both Germany and California.
p121
aVWe don't have backup; we don't have all the natural gas.
p122
aVAnd that's just the start of it.
p123
aVSay we want to get to 100 gigawatts by 2022.
p124
aVBut last year we did just five,
p125
aVand the year before that, we did five."
p126
aa(lp127
VSo, let's just take a closer look at nuclear.
p128
aVThe United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
p129
aVhas looked at the carbon content of all these different fuels,
p130
aVand nuclear comes out really low \u2014 it's actually lower even than solar.
p131
aVAnd nuclear obviously provides a lot of power \u2014
p132
aV24 hours a day, seven days a week.
p133
aVDuring a year, a single plant can provide power 92 percent of the time.
p134
aVWhat's interesting is that when you look at countries
p135
aVthat have deployed different kinds of clean energies,
p136
aVthere's only a few that have done so
p137
aVat a pace consistent with dealing with the climate crisis.
p138
aa(lp139
VSo nuclear seems like a pretty good option,
p140
aVbut there's this big problem with it,
p141
aVwhich all of you, I'm sure, are aware of,
p142
aVwhich is that people really don't like it.
p143
aVThere was a study, a survey done of people around the world,
p144
aVnot just in the United States or Europe,
p145
aVabout a year and a half ago.
p146
aVAnd what they found
p147
aVis that nuclear is actually one of the least popular forms of energy.
p148
aVEven oil is more popular than nuclear.
p149
aVAnd while nuclear kind of edges out coal, the thing is,
p150
aVpeople don't really fear coal in the same way they fear nuclear,
p151
aVwhich really operates on our unconscious.
p152
aa(lp153
VSo what is it that we fear?
p154
aVThere's really three things.
p155
aVThere's the safety of the plants themselves \u2014
p156
aVthe fears that they're going to melt down and cause damage;
p157
aVthere's the waste from them;
p158
aVand there's the association with weapons.
p159
aVAnd I think, understandably,
p160
aVengineers look at those concerns and look for technological fixes.
p161
aVThat's why Bill Gates is in China developing advanced reactors.
p162
aVThat's why 40 different entrepreneurs are working on this problem.
p163
aVAnd I, myself, have been very excited about it.
p164
aa(lp165
VWe did a report: "How to Make Nuclear Cheap."
p166
aVIn particular, the thorium reactor shows a lot of promise.
p167
aVSo when the climate scientist, James Hansen,
p168
aVasked if I wanted to go to China with him
p169
aVand look at the Chinese advanced nuclear program,
p170
aVI jumped at the chance.
p171
aVWe were there with MIT and UC Berkeley engineers.
p172
aVAnd I had in my mind
p173
aVthat the Chinese would be able to do with nuclear
p174
aVwhat they did with so many other things \u2014
p175
aVstart to crank out small nuclear reactors on assembly lines,
p176
aVship them up like iPhones or MacBooks and send them around the world.
p177
aVI would get one at home in Berkeley.
p178
aVBut what I found was somewhat different.
p179
aVThe presentations were all very exciting and very promising;
p180
aVthey have multiple reactors that they're working on.
p181
aVThe time came for the thorium reactor, and a bunch of us were excited.
p182
aVThey went through the whole presentation, they got to the timeline,
p183
aVand they said,
p184
aV"We're going to have a thorium molten salt reactor
p185
aVready for sale to the world
p186
aVby 2040."
p187
aVAnd I was like, "What?"
p188
aa(lp189
V(Laughter)
p190
aa(lp191
VI looked at my colleagues and I was like,
p192
aV"Excuse me \u2014
p193
aVcan you guys speed that up a little bit?
p194
aVBecause we're in a little bit of a climate crisis right now.
p195
aVAnd your cities are really polluted, by the way."
p196
aVAnd they responded back, they were like,
p197
aV"I'm not sure what you've heard about our thorium program,
p198
aVbut we don't have a third of our budget,
p199
aVand your department of energy hasn't been particularly forthcoming
p200
aVwith all that data you guys have on testing reactors."
p201
aVAnd I said, "Well, I've got an idea.
p202
aVYou know how you've got 10 years where you're demonstrating that reactor?
p203
aVLet's just skip that part,
p204
aVand let's just go right to commercializing it.
p205
aVThat will save money and time."
p206
aVAnd the engineer just looked at me and said,
p207
aV"Let me ask you a question:
p208
aVWould you buy a car that had never been demonstrated before?"
p209
aa(lp210
VSo what about the other reactors?
p211
aVThere's a reactor that's coming online now, they're starting to sell it.
p212
aVIt's a high-temperature gas reactor.
p213
aVIt can't melt down.
p214
aVBut it's really big and bulky, that's part of the safety,
p215
aVand nobody thinks it's going to ever get cheaper
p216
aVthan the reactors that we have.
p217
aVThe ones that use waste as fuel are really cool ideas, but the truth is,
p218
aVwe don't actually know how to do that yet.
p219
aVThere's some risk that you'll actually make more waste,
p220
aVand most people think that if you're including
p221
aVthat waste part of the process,
p222
aVit's just going to make the whole machine a lot more expensive,
p223
aVit's just adding another complicated step.
p224
aa(lp225
VThe truth is,
p226
aVthere's real questions about how much of that we're going to do.
p227
aVI mean, we went to India and asked about the nuclear program.
p228
aVThe government said before the Paris climate talks
p229
aVthat they were going to do something like 30 new nuclear plants.
p230
aVBut when we got there and interviewed people
p231
aVand even looked at the internal documents,
p232
aVthey're now saying they're going to do about five.
p233
aVAnd in most of the world, especially the rich world,
p234
aVthey're not talking about building new reactors.
p235
aVWe're actually talking about taking reactors down
p236
aVbefore their lifetimes are over.
p237
aVGermany's actually pressuring its neighbors to do that.
p238
aVI mentioned the United States \u2014
p239
aVwe could lose half of our reactors over the next 15 years,
p240
aVwhich would wipe out 40 percent of the emissions reductions
p241
aVwe're supposed to get under the Clean Power Plan.
p242
aVOf course, in Japan, they took all their nuclear plants offline,
p243
aVreplaced them with coal, natural gas, oil burning,
p244
aVand they're only expected to bring online about a third to two-thirds.
p245
aa(lp246
VSo when we went through the numbers,
p247
aVand just added that up \u2014
p248
aVhow much nuclear do we see China and India bringing online
p249
aVover the next 15 years,
p250
aVhow much do we see at risk of being taken offline \u2014
p251
aVthis was the most startling finding.
p252
aVWhat we found is that the world is actually at risk
p253
aVof losing four times more clean energy than we lost over the last 10 years.
p254
aVIn other words: we're not in a clean energy revolution;
p255
aVwe're in a clean energy crisis.
p256
aVSo it's understandable that engineers would look for a technical fix
p257
aVto the fears that people have of nuclear.
p258
aVBut when you consider that these are big challenges to do,
p259
aVthat they're going to take a long time to solve,
p260
aVthere's this other issue, which is:
p261
aVAre those technical fixes really going to solve people's fears?
p262
aa(lp263
VLet's take safety.
p264
aVYou know, despite what people think,
p265
aVit's hard to figure out how to make nuclear power much safer.
p266
aVI mean, every medical journal that looks at it \u2014
p267
aVthis is the most recent study from the British journal, "Lancet,"
p268
aVone of the most respected journals in the world \u2014
p269
aVnuclear is the safest way to make reliable power.
p270
aVEverybody's scared of the accidents.
p271
aVSo you go look at the accident data \u2014
p272
aVFukushima, Chernobyl \u2014
p273
aVthe World Health Organization finds the same thing:
p274
aVthe vast majority of harm is caused by people panicking,
p275
aVand they're panicking because they're afraid.
p276
aVIn other words,
p277
aVthe harm that's caused isn't actually caused by the machines
p278
aVor the radiation.
p279
aVIt's caused by our fears.
p280
aa(lp281
VAnd what about the waste?
p282
aVEveryone worries about the waste.
p283
aVWell, the interesting thing about the waste
p284
aVis how little of it there is.
p285
aVThis is just from one plant.
p286
aVIf you take all the nuclear waste we've ever made in the United States,
p287
aVput it on a football field, stacked it up,
p288
aVit would only reach 20 feet high.
p289
aVAnd people say it's poisoning people or doing something \u2014
p290
aVit's not, it's just sitting there, it's just being monitored.
p291
aVThere's not very much of it.
p292
aVBy contrast, the waste that we don't control from energy production \u2014
p293
aVwe call it "pollution," and it kills seven million people a year,
p294
aVand it's threatening very serious levels of global warming.
p295
aVAnd the truth is that even if we get good at using that waste as fuel,
p296
aVthere's always going to be some fuel left over.
p297
aVThat means there's always going to be people that think it's a big problem
p298
aVfor reasons that maybe don't have as much to do with the actual waste
p299
aVas we think.
p300
aa(lp301
VWell, what about the weapons?
p302
aVMaybe the most surprising thing is that we can't find any examples
p303
aVof countries that have nuclear power
p304
aVand then, "Oh!" decide to go get a weapon.
p305
aVIn fact, it works the opposite.
p306
aVWhat we find is the only way we know
p307
aVhow to get rid large numbers of nuclear weapons
p308
aVis by using the plutonium in the warheads
p309
aVas fuel in our nuclear power plants.
p310
aVAnd so, if you are wanting to get the world rid of nuclear weapons,
p311
aVthen we're going to need a lot more nuclear power.
p312
aa(lp313
V(Applause)
p314
aa(lp315
VAs I was leaving China,
p316
aVthe engineer that brought Bill Gates there kind of pulled me aside,
p317
aVand he said, "You know, Michael, I appreciate your interest
p318
aVin all the different nuclear supply technologies,
p319
aVbut there's this more basic issue,
p320
aVwhich is that there's just not enough global demand.
p321
aVI mean, we can crank out these machines on assembly lines,
p322
aVwe do know how to make things cheap,
p323
aVbut there's just not enough people that want them."
p324
aa(lp325
VAnd so, let's do solar and wind and efficiency and conservation.
p326
aVLet's accelerate the advanced nuclear programs.
p327
aVI think we should triple the amount of money we're spending on it.
p328
aVBut I just think the most important thing,
p329
aVif we're going to overcome the climate crisis,
p330
aVis to keep in mind that the cause of the clean energy crisis
p331
aVisn't from within our machines,
p332
aVit's from within ourselves.
p333
aa(lp334
VThank you very much.
