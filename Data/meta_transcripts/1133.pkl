VI thought I'd talk a little bit about how nature makes materials.
p4
aVI brought along with me an abalone shell.
p5
aVThis abalone shell is a biocomposite material
p6
aVthat's 98 percent by mass calcium carbonate
p7
aVand two percent by mass protein.
p8
aVYet, it's 3,000 times tougher than its geological counterpart.
p9
aVAnd a lot of people might use structures like abalone shells,
p10
aVlike chalk.
p11
aVI've been fascinated by how nature makes materials,
p12
aVand there's a lot of secrets to how they do such an exquisite job.
p13
aVPart of it is that these materials are macroscopic in structure,
p14
aVbut they're formed at the nano scale.
p15
aVThey're formed at the nano scale,
p16
aVand they use proteins that are coded by the genetic level
p17
aVthat allow them to build these really exquisite structures.
p18
aa(lp19
VSo something I think is very fascinating is:
p20
aVWhat if you could give life to non-living structures,
p21
aVlike batteries and like solar cells?
p22
aVWhat if they had some of the same capabilities
p23
aVthat an abalone shell did,
p24
aVin terms of being able to build really exquisite structures
p25
aVat room temperature and room pressure,
p26
aVusing nontoxic chemicals
p27
aVand adding no toxic materials back into the environment?
p28
aVSo that's kind of the vision that I've been thinking about.
p29
aVAnd so what if you could grow a battery in a Petri dish?
p30
aVOr what if you could give genetic information to a battery
p31
aVso that it could actually become better as a function of time, and do so
p32
aVin an environmentally friendly way?
p33
aa(lp34
VAnd so, going back to this abalone shell,
p35
aVbesides being nanostructured, one thing that's fascinating is,
p36
aVwhen a male and female abalone get together,
p37
aVthey pass on the genetic information that says,
p38
aV"This is how to build an exquisite material.
p39
aVHere's how to do it at room temperature and pressure,
p40
aVusing nontoxic materials."
p41
aVSame with diatoms, which are shown right here,
p42
aVwhich are glasseous structures.
p43
aVEvery time the diatoms replicate,
p44
aVthey give the genetic information that says,
p45
aV"Here's how to build glass in the ocean that's perfectly nanostructured."
p46
aVAnd you can do it the same, over and over again."
p47
aVSo what if you could do the same thing with a solar cell or a battery?
p48
aVI like to say my favorite biomaterial is my four year old.
p49
aa(lp50
VBut anyone who's ever had or knows small children knows,
p51
aVthey're incredibly complex organisms.
p52
aVIf you wanted to convince them to do something they don't want to do,
p53
aVit's very difficult.
p54
aVSo when we think about future technologies,
p55
aVwe actually think of using bacteria and viruses \u2014
p56
aVsimple organisms.
p57
aVCan you convince them to work with a new toolbox,
p58
aVso they can build a structure that will be important to me?
p59
aa(lp60
VAlso, when we think about future technologies,
p61
aVwe start with the beginning of Earth.
p62
aVBasically, it took a billion years to have life on Earth.
p63
aVAnd very rapidly, they became multi-cellular,
p64
aVthey could replicate, they could use photosynthesis
p65
aVas a way of getting their energy source.
p66
aVBut it wasn't until about 500 million years ago \u2014
p67
aVduring the Cambrian geologic time period \u2014
p68
aVthat organisms in the ocean started making hard materials.
p69
aVBefore that, they were all soft, fluffy structures.
p70
aVIt was during this time that there was increased calcium,
p71
aViron and silicon in the environment,
p72
aVand organisms learned how to make hard materials.
p73
aVSo that's what I would like to be able to do,
p74
aVconvince biology to work with the rest of the periodic table.
p75
aa(lp76
VNow, if you look at biology,
p77
aVthere's many structures like DNA, antibodies, proteins and ribosomes
p78
aVyou've heard about,
p79
aVthat are nanostructured \u2014
p80
aVnature already gives us really exquisite structures on the nano scale.
p81
aVWhat if we could harness them
p82
aVand convince them to not be an antibody that does something like HIV?
p83
aVWhat if we could convince them to build a solar cell for us?
p84
aVHere are some examples.
p85
aVNatural shells, natural biological materials.
p86
aVThe abalone shell here.
p87
aVIf you fracture it, you can look at the fact that it's nanostructured.
p88
aVThere's diatoms made out of SiO2,
p89
aVand there are magnetotactic bacteria
p90
aVthat make small, single-domain magnets used for navigation.
p91
aVWhat all these have in common
p92
aVis these materials are structured at the nano scale,
p93
aVand they have a DNA sequence that codes for a protein sequence
p94
aVthat gives them the blueprint
p95
aVto be able to build these really wonderful structures.
p96
aVNow, going back to the abalone shell,
p97
aVthe abalone makes this shell by having these proteins.
p98
aVThese proteins are very negatively charged.
p99
aVThey can pull calcium out of the environment,
p100
aVand put down a layer of calcium and then carbonate, calcium and carbonate.
p101
aVIt has the chemical sequences of amino acids which says,
p102
aV"This is how to build the structure.
p103
aVHere's the DNA sequence, here's the protein sequence
p104
aVin order to do it."
p105
aVSo an interesting idea is,
p106
aVwhat if you could take any material you wanted,
p107
aVor any element on the periodic table,
p108
aVand find its corresponding DNA sequence,
p109
aVthen code it for a corresponding protein sequence to build a structure,
p110
aVbut not build an abalone shell \u2014
p111
aVbuild something that nature has never had the opportunity to work with yet.
p112
aa(lp113
VAnd so here's the periodic table.
p114
aVI absolutely love the periodic table.
p115
aVEvery year for the incoming freshman class at MIT,
p116
aVI have a periodic table made that says,
p117
aV"Welcome to MIT. Now you're in your element."
p118
aa(lp119
V(Laughter)
p120
aa(lp121
VAnd you flip it over, and it's the amino acids
p122
aVwith the pH at which they have different charges.
p123
aVAnd so I give this out to thousands of people.
p124
aVAnd I know it says MIT and this is Caltech,
p125
aVbut I have a couple extra if people want it.
p126
aVI was really fortunate to have President Obama visit my lab this year
p127
aVon his visit to MIT,
p128
aVand I really wanted to give him a periodic table.
p129
aVSo I stayed up at night and talked to my husband,
p130
aV"How do I give President Obama a periodic table?
p131
aVWhat if he says, 'Oh, I already have one,'
p132
aVor, 'I've already memorized it?'"
p133
aa(lp134
V(Laughter)
p135
aa(lp136
VSo he came to visit my lab and looked around \u2014 it was a great visit.
p137
aVAnd then afterward, I said,
p138
aV"Sir, I want to give you the periodic table,
p139
aVin case you're ever in a bind and need to calculate molecular weight."
p140
aa(lp141
V(Laughter)
p142
aa(lp143
VI thought "molecular weight" sounded much less nerdy than "molar mass."
p144
aa(lp145
V(Laughter)
p146
aa(lp147
VAnd he looked at it and said,
p148
aV"Thank you. I'll look at it periodically."
p149
aa(lp150
V(Laughter)
p151
aa(lp152
V(Applause)
p153
aa(lp154
VLater in a lecture that he gave on clean energy,
p155
aVhe pulled it out and said,
p156
aV"And people at MIT, they give out periodic tables." So ...
p157
aa(lp158
VSo basically what I didn't tell you
p159
aVis that about 500 million years ago, the organisms started making materials,
p160
aVbut it took them about 50 million years to get good at it \u2014
p161
aV50 million years to learn how to perfect how to make that abalone shell.
p162
aVAnd that's a hard sell to a graduate student:
p163
aV"I have this great project ... 50 million years ..."
p164
aVSo we had to develop a way of trying to do this more rapidly.
p165
aVAnd so we use a nontoxic virus called M13 bacteriophage,
p166
aVwhose job is to infect bacteria.
p167
aVWell, it has a simple DNA structure
p168
aVthat you can go in and cut and paste additional DNA sequences into it,
p169
aVand by doing that, it allows the virus to express random protein sequences.
p170
aa(lp171
VThis is pretty easy biotechnology,
p172
aVand you could basically do this a billion times.
p173
aVSo you can have a billion different viruses
p174
aVthat are all genetically identical,
p175
aVbut they differ from each other based on their tips,
p176
aVon one sequence,
p177
aVthat codes for one protein.
p178
aVNow if you take all billion viruses, and put them in one drop of liquid,
p179
aVyou can force them to interact with anything you want
p180
aVon the periodic table.
p181
aVAnd through a process of selection evolution,
p182
aVyou can pull one of a billion that does something you'd like it to do,
p183
aVlike grow a battery or a solar cell.
p184
aa(lp185
VBasically, viruses can't replicate themselves; they need a host.
p186
aVOnce you find that one out of a billion,
p187
aVyou infect it into a bacteria, and make millions and billions of copies
p188
aVof that particular sequence.
p189
aVThe other thing that's beautiful about biology
p190
aVis that biology gives you really exquisite structures
p191
aVwith nice link scales.
p192
aVThese viruses are long and skinny,
p193
aVand we can get them to express the ability
p194
aVto grow something like semiconductors
p195
aVor materials for batteries.
p196
aa(lp197
VNow, this is a high-powered battery that we grew in my lab.
p198
aVWe engineered a virus to pick up carbon nanotubes.
p199
aVOne part of the virus grabs a carbon nanotube,
p200
aVthe other part of the virus has a sequence
p201
aVthat can grow an electrode material for a battery,
p202
aVand then it wires itself to the current collector.
p203
aVAnd so through a process of selection evolution,
p204
aVwe went from being able to have a virus that made a crummy battery
p205
aVto a virus that made a good battery
p206
aVto a virus that made a record-breaking, high-powered battery
p207
aVthat's all made at room temperature, basically at the benchtop.
p208
aVThat battery went to the White House for a press conference,
p209
aVand I brought it here.
p210
aVYou can see it in this case that's lighting this LED.
p211
aVNow if we could scale this,
p212
aVyou could actually use it to run your Prius,
p213
aVwhich is kind of my dream \u2014 to be able to drive a virus-powered car.
p214
aa(lp215
V(Laughter)
p216
aa(lp217
VBut basically you can pull one out of a billion,
p218
aVand make lots of amplifications to it.
p219
aVBasically, you make an amplification in the lab,
p220
aVand then you get it to self-assemble into a structure like a battery.
p221
aVWe're able to do this also with catalysis.
p222
aVThis is the example of a photocatalytic splitting of water.
p223
aVAnd what we've been able to do is engineer a virus
p224
aVto basically take dye-absorbing molecules
p225
aVand line them up on the surface of the virus
p226
aVso it acts as an antenna,
p227
aVand you get an energy transfer across the virus.
p228
aVAnd then we give it a second gene to grow an inorganic material
p229
aVthat can be used to split water into oxygen and hydrogen,
p230
aVthat can be used for clean fuels.
p231
aVI brought an example of that with me today.
p232
aVMy students promised me it would work.
p233
aVThese are virus-assembled nanowires.
p234
aVWhen you shine light on them, you can see them bubbling.
p235
aVIn this case, you're seeing oxygen bubbles come out.
p236
aa(lp237
V(Applause)
p238
aa(lp239
VBasically, by controlling the genes,
p240
aVyou can control multiple materials to improve your device performance.
p241
aa(lp242
VThe last example are solar cells.
p243
aVYou can also do this with solar cells.
p244
aVWe've been able to engineer viruses to pick up carbon nanotubes
p245
aVand then grow titanium dioxide around them,
p246
aVand use it as a way of getting electrons through the device.
p247
aVAnd what we've found is through genetic engineering,
p248
aVwe can actually increase the efficiencies of these solar cells
p249
aVto record numbers
p250
aVfor these types of dye-sensitized systems.
p251
aVAnd I brought one of those as well,
p252
aVthat you can play around with outside afterward.
p253
aVSo this is a virus-based solar cell.
p254
aVThrough evolution and selection,
p255
aVwe took it from an eight percent efficiency solar cell
p256
aVto an 11 percent efficiency solar cell.
p257
aa(lp258
VSo I hope that I've convinced you
p259
aVthat there's a lot of great, interesting things to be learned
p260
aVabout how nature makes materials,
p261
aVand about taking it the next step,
p262
aVto see if you can force or take advantage of how nature makes materials,
p263
aVto make things that nature hasn't yet dreamed of making.
p264
aa(lp265
VThank you.
