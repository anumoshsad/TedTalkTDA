VIt would be nice to be objective in life,
p4
aVin many ways.
p5
aVThe problem is that we have these color-tinted glasses
p6
aVas we look at all kinds of situations.
p7
aVFor example, think about something as simple as beer.
p8
aVIf I gave you a few beers to taste
p9
aVand I asked you to rate them on intensity and bitterness,
p10
aVdifferent beers would occupy different space.
p11
aVBut what if we tried to be objective about it?
p12
aVIn the case of beer, it would be very simple.
p13
aVWhat if we did a blind taste?
p14
aVWell, if we did the same thing, you tasted the same beer,
p15
aVnow in the blind taste, things would look slightly different.
p16
aVMost of the beers will go into one place.
p17
aVYou will basically not be able to distinguish them,
p18
aVand the exception, of course, will be Guinness.
p19
aV(Laughter)
p20
aa(lp21
VSimilarly, we can think about physiology.
p22
aVWhat happens when people expect something from their physiology?
p23
aVFor example, we sold people pain medications.
p24
aVSome people, we told them the medications were expensive.
p25
aVSome people, we told them it was cheap.
p26
aVAnd the expensive pain medication worked better.
p27
aVIt relieved more pain from people,
p28
aVbecause expectations do change our physiology.
p29
aVAnd of course, we all know that in sports,
p30
aVif you are a fan of a particular team,
p31
aVyou can't help but see the game
p32
aVdevelop from the perspective of your team.
p33
aa(lp34
VSo all of those are cases in which our preconceived notions
p35
aVand our expectations color our world.
p36
aVBut what happened in more important questions?
p37
aVWhat happened with questions that had to do with social justice?
p38
aVSo we wanted to think about what is the blind tasting version
p39
aVfor thinking about inequality?
p40
aVSo we started looking at inequality,
p41
aVand we did some large-scale surveys
p42
aVaround the U.S. and other countries.
p43
aVSo we asked two questions:
p44
aVDo people know what kind of level of inequality we have?
p45
aVAnd then, what level of inequality do we want to have?
p46
aVSo let's think about the first question.
p47
aVImagine I took all the people in the U.S.
p48
aVand I sorted them from the poorest on the right
p49
aVto the richest on the left,
p50
aVand then I divided them into five buckets:
p51
aVthe poorest 20 percent, the next 20 percent,
p52
aVthe next, the next, and the richest 20 percent.
p53
aVAnd then I asked you to tell me how much wealth do you think
p54
aVis concentrated in each of those buckets.
p55
aVSo to make it simpler, imagine I ask you to tell me,
p56
aVhow much wealth do you think is concentrated
p57
aVin the bottom two buckets,
p58
aVthe bottom 40 percent?
p59
aVTake a second. Think about it and have a number.
p60
aVUsually we don't think.
p61
aVThink for a second, have a real number in your mind.
p62
aVYou have it?
p63
aa(lp64
VOkay, here's what lots of Americans tell us.
p65
aVThey think that the bottom 20 percent
p66
aVhas about 2.9 percent of the wealth,
p67
aVthe next group has 6.4,
p68
aVso together it's slightly more than nine.
p69
aVThe next group, they say, has 12 percent,
p70
aV20 percent,
p71
aVand the richest 20 percent, people think has 58 percent of the wealth.
p72
aVYou can see how this relates to what you thought.
p73
aa(lp74
VNow, what's reality?
p75
aVReality is slightly different.
p76
aVThe bottom 20 percent has 0.1 percent of the wealth.
p77
aVThe next 20 percent has 0.2 percent of the wealth.
p78
aVTogether, it's 0.3.
p79
aVThe next group has 3.9,
p80
aV11.3,
p81
aVand the richest group has 84-85 percent of the wealth.
p82
aVSo what we actually have and what we think we have
p83
aVare very different.
p84
aa(lp85
VWhat about what we want?
p86
aVHow do we even figure this out?
p87
aVSo to look at this,
p88
aVto look at what we really want,
p89
aVwe thought about the philosopher John Rawls.
p90
aVIf you remember John Rawls,
p91
aVhe had this notion of what's a just society.
p92
aVHe said a just society
p93
aVis a society that if you knew everything about it,
p94
aVyou would be willing to enter it in a random place.
p95
aVAnd it's a beautiful definition,
p96
aVbecause if you're wealthy, you might want the wealthy
p97
aVto have more money, the poor to have less.
p98
aVIf you're poor, you might want more equality.
p99
aVBut if you're going to go into that society
p100
aVin every possible situation, and you don't know,
p101
aVyou have to consider all the aspects.
p102
aVIt's a little bit like blind tasting in which you don't know
p103
aVwhat the outcome will be when you make a decision,
p104
aVand Rawls called this the "veil of ignorance."
p105
aa(lp106
VSo, we took another group, a large group of Americans,
p107
aVand we asked them the question in the veil of ignorance.
p108
aVWhat are the characteristics of a country that would make you want to join it,
p109
aVknowing that you could end randomly at any place?
p110
aVAnd here is what we got.
p111
aVWhat did people want to give to the first group,
p112
aVthe bottom 20 percent?
p113
aVThey wanted to give them about 10 percent of the wealth.
p114
aVThe next group, 14 percent of the wealth,
p115
aV21, 22 and 32.
p116
aa(lp117
VNow, nobody in our sample wanted full equality.
p118
aVNobody thought that socialism is a fantastic idea in our sample.
p119
aVBut what does it mean?
p120
aVIt means that we have this knowledge gap
p121
aVbetween what we have and what we think we have,
p122
aVbut we have at least as big a gap between what we think is right
p123
aVto what we think we have.
p124
aa(lp125
VNow, we can ask these questions, by the way, not just about wealth.
p126
aVWe can ask it about other things as well.
p127
aVSo for example, we asked people from different parts of the world
p128
aVabout this question,
p129
aVpeople who are liberals and conservatives,
p130
aVand they gave us basically  the same answer.
p131
aVWe asked rich and poor, they gave us the same answer,
p132
aVmen and women,
p133
aVNPR listeners and Forbes readers.
p134
aVWe asked people in England, Australia, the U.S. \u2014
p135
aVvery similar answers.
p136
aVWe even asked different departments of a university.
p137
aVWe went to Harvard and we checked almost every department,
p138
aVand in fact, from Harvard Business School,
p139
aVwhere a few people wanted the wealthy to have more and the [poor] to have less,
p140
aVthe similarity was astonishing.
p141
aVI know some of you went to Harvard Business School.
p142
aa(lp143
VWe also asked this question about something else.
p144
aVWe asked, what about the ratio of CEO pay to unskilled workers?
p145
aVSo you can see what people think is the ratio,
p146
aVand then we can ask the question, what do they think should be the ratio?
p147
aVAnd then we can ask, what is reality?
p148
aVWhat is reality? And you could say, well, it's not that bad, right?
p149
aVThe red and the yellow are not that different.
p150
aVBut the fact is, it's because I didn't draw them on the same scale.
p151
aVIt's hard to see, there's yellow and blue in there.
p152
aa(lp153
VSo what about other outcomes of wealth?
p154
aVWealth is not just about wealth.
p155
aVWe asked, what about things like health?
p156
aVWhat about availability of prescription medication?
p157
aVWhat about life expectancy?
p158
aVWhat about life expectancy of infants?
p159
aVHow do we want this to be distributed?
p160
aVWhat about education for young people?
p161
aVAnd for older people?
p162
aVAnd across all of those things, what we learned was that people
p163
aVdon't like inequality of wealth,
p164
aVbut there's other things where inequality, which is an outcome of wealth,
p165
aVis even more aversive to them:
p166
aVfor example, inequality in health or education.
p167
aVWe also learned that people are particularly open
p168
aVto changes in equality when it comes to people
p169
aVwho have less agency \u2014
p170
aVbasically, young kids and babies,
p171
aVbecause we don't think of them as responsible for their situation.
p172
aa(lp173
VSo what are some lessons from this?
p174
aVWe have two gaps:
p175
aVWe have a knowledge gap and we have a desirability gap
p176
aVAnd the knowledge gap is something that we think about,
p177
aVhow do we educate people?
p178
aVHow do we get people to think differently about inequality
p179
aVand the consequences of inequality in terms of health, education,
p180
aVjealousy, crime rate, and so on?
p181
aa(lp182
VThen we have the desirability gap.
p183
aVHow do we get people to think differently about what we really want?
p184
aVYou see, the Rawls definition, the Rawls way of looking at the world,
p185
aVthe blind tasting approach,
p186
aVtakes our selfish motivation out of the picture.
p187
aVHow do we implement that to a higher degree
p188
aVon a more extensive scale?
p189
aa(lp190
VAnd finally, we also have an action gap.
p191
aVHow do we take these things and actually do something about it?
p192
aVI think part of the answer is to think about people
p193
aVlike young kids and babies that don't have much agency,
p194
aVbecause people seem to be more willing to do this.
p195
aa(lp196
VTo summarize, I would say, next time you go to drink beer or wine,
p197
aVfirst of all, think about, what is it in your experience that is real,
p198
aVand what is it in your experience that is a placebo effect
p199
aVcoming from expectations?
p200
aVAnd then think about what it also means for other decisions in your life,
p201
aVand hopefully also for policy questions
p202
aVthat affect all of us.
p203
