VWill we do whatever it takes to tackle climate change?
p4
aa(lp5
VI come at this question not as a green campaigner,
p6
aVin fact, I confess to be rather hopeless at recycling.
p7
aVI come at it as a professional observer of financial policy making
p8
aVand someone that wonders how history will judge us.
p9
aa(lp10
VOne day,
p11
aVthis ring that belonged to my grandfather
p12
aVwill pass to my son, Charlie.
p13
aVAnd I wonder what his generation
p14
aVand perhaps the one that follows
p15
aVwill make of the two lives this ring has worked.
p16
aa(lp17
VMy grandfather was a coal miner.
p18
aVIn his time,
p19
aVburning fossil fuels for energy and for allowing economies to develop
p20
aVwas accepted.
p21
aVWe know now that that is not the case
p22
aVbecause of the greenhouse gases that coal produces.
p23
aVBut today,
p24
aVI fear it's the industry in which I work that will be judged more harshly
p25
aVbecause of its impact on the climate \u2014
p26
aVmore harshly than my grandfather's industry, even.
p27
aa(lp28
VI work, of course, in the banking industry,
p29
aVwhich will be remembered for its crisis in 2008 \u2014
p30
aVa crisis that diverted the attention and finances of governments
p31
aVaway from some really, really important promises,
p32
aVlike promises made at the Copenhagen Climate Summit in 2009
p33
aVto mobilize 100 billion dollars a year
p34
aVto help developing countries move away from burning fossil fuels
p35
aVand transition to using cleaner energy.
p36
aVThat promise is already in jeopardy.
p37
aVAnd that's a real problem,
p38
aVbecause that transition to cleaner energy needs to happen
p39
aVsooner rather than later.
p40
aa(lp41
VFirstly,
p42
aVbecause greenhouse gases, once released,
p43
aVstay in the atmosphere for decades.
p44
aVAnd secondly,
p45
aVif a developing economy builds its power grid around fossil fuels today,
p46
aVit's going to be way more costly to change later on.
p47
aVSo for the climate,
p48
aVhistory may judge that the banking crisis happened
p49
aVat just the wrong time.
p50
aVThe story need not be this gloomy, though.
p51
aa(lp52
VThree years ago,
p53
aVI argued that governments could use the tools
p54
aVdeployed to save the financial system
p55
aVto meet other global challenges.
p56
aVAnd these arguments are getting stronger, not weaker, with time.
p57
aVLet's take a brief reminder of what those tools looked like.
p58
aa(lp59
VWhen the financial crisis hit in 2008,
p60
aVthe central banks of the US and UK
p61
aVbegan buying bonds issued by their own governments
p62
aVin a policy known as "quantitative easing."
p63
aVDepending on what happens to those bonds when they mature,
p64
aVthis is money printing by another name.
p65
aVAnd boy, did they print.
p66
aVThe US alone created four trillion dollars' worth of its own currency.
p67
aVThis was not done in isolation.
p68
aVIn a remarkable act of cooperation,
p69
aVthe 188 countries that make up the International Monetary Fund, the IMF,
p70
aVagreed to issue 250 billion dollars' worth of their own currency \u2014
p71
aVthe Special Drawing Right \u2014
p72
aVto boost reserves around the world.
p73
aa(lp74
VWhen the financial crisis moved to Europe,
p75
aVthe European Central Bank President, Mario Draghi,
p76
aVpromised "to do whatever it takes."
p77
aVAnd they did.
p78
aVThe Bank of Japan repeated those words \u2014 that exact same commitment \u2014
p79
aVto do "whatever it takes" to reflate their economy.
p80
aVIn both cases,
p81
aV"whatever it takes" meant trillions of dollars more
p82
aVin money-printing policies that continue today.
p83
aVWhat this shows
p84
aVis that when faced with some global challenges,
p85
aVpolicy makers are able to act collectively, with urgency,
p86
aVand run the risks of unconventional policies like money printing.
p87
aa(lp88
VSo, let's go back to that original question:
p89
aVCan we print money for climate finance?
p90
aVThree years ago,
p91
aVthe idea of using money in this way was something of a taboo.
p92
aVOnce you break down and dismantle the idea
p93
aVthat money is a finite resource,
p94
aVgovernments can quickly get overwhelmed by demands from their people
p95
aVto print more and more money for other causes:
p96
aVeducation, health care, welfare \u2014
p97
aVeven defense.
p98
aa(lp99
VAnd there are some truly terrible historical examples of money printing \u2014
p100
aVuncontrolled money printing \u2014
p101
aVleading to hyperinflation.
p102
aVThink: Weimar Republic in 1930;
p103
aVZimbabwe more recently, in 2008,
p104
aVwhen the prices of basic goods like bread are doubling every day.
p105
aVBut all of this is moving the public debate forward,
p106
aVso much so, that money printing for the people is now discussed openly
p107
aVin the financial media, and even in some political manifestos.
p108
aa(lp109
VBut it's important the debate doesn't stop here,
p110
aVwith printing national currencies.
p111
aVBecause climate change is a shared global problem,
p112
aVthere are some really compelling reasons
p113
aVwhy we should be printing that international currency
p114
aVthat's issued by the IMF,
p115
aVto fund it.
p116
aVThe Special Drawing Right, or SDR,
p117
aVis the IMF's electronic unit of account
p118
aVthat governments use to transfer funds amongst each other.
p119
aVThink of it as a peer-to-peer payment network,
p120
aVlike Bitcoin, but for governments.
p121
aa(lp122
VAnd it's truly global.
p123
aVEach of the 188 members of the IMF hold SDR quotas
p124
aVas part of their foreign exchange reserves.
p125
aVThese are national stores of wealth
p126
aVthat countries keep to protect themselves against currency crises.
p127
aVAnd that global nature is why,
p128
aVat the height of the financial crisis in 2009,
p129
aVthe IMF issued those extra 250 billion dollars \u2014
p130
aVbecause it served as a collective global action
p131
aVthat safeguarded countries large and small in one fell swoop.
p132
aa(lp133
VBut here \u2014
p134
aVhere's the intriguing part.
p135
aVMore than half of those extra SDRs that were printed in 2009 \u2014
p136
aV150 billion dollars' worth \u2014
p137
aVwent to developed market countries who, for the most part,
p138
aVhave a modest need for these foreign exchange reserves,
p139
aVbecause they have flexible exchange rates.
p140
aVSo those extra reserves that were printed in 2009,
p141
aVin the end, for developed market countries at least,
p142
aVweren't really needed.
p143
aVAnd they remain unused today.
p144
aa(lp145
VSo here's an idea.
p146
aVAs a first step,
p147
aVwhy don't we start spending those unused,
p148
aVthose extra SDRs that were printed in 2009,
p149
aVto combat climate change?
p150
aa(lp151
VThey could, for example,
p152
aVbe used to buy bonds issued by the UN's Green Climate Fund.
p153
aVThis was a fund created in 2009,
p154
aVfollowing that climate agreement in Copenhagen.
p155
aVAnd it was designed to channel funds towards developing countries
p156
aVto meet their climate projects.
p157
aVIt's been one of the most successful funds of its type,
p158
aVraising almost 10 billion dollars.
p159
aVBut if we use those extra SDRs that were issued,
p160
aVit helps governments get back on track,
p161
aVto meet that promise of 100 billion dollars a year
p162
aVthat was derailed by the financial crisis.
p163
aa(lp164
VIt could also \u2014
p165
aVit could also serve as a test case.
p166
aVIf the inflationary consequences of using SDRs in this way are benign,
p167
aVit could be used to justify
p168
aVthe additional, extra issuance of SDRs, say, every five years,
p169
aVagain, with the commitment
p170
aVthat developed-market countries would direct their share
p171
aVof the new reserves
p172
aVto the Green Climate Fund.
p173
aa(lp174
VPrinting international money in this way has several advantages
p175
aVover printing national currencies.
p176
aVThe first is it's really easy to argue
p177
aVthat spending money to mitigate climate change benefits everyone.
p178
aVNo one section of society benefits from the printing press over another.
p179
aVThat problem of competing claims is mitigated.
p180
aVIt's also fair to say
p181
aVthat because it takes so many countries to agree to issue these extra SDRs,
p182
aVit's highly unlikely that money printing would get out of control.
p183
aVWhat you end up with is a collective, global action
p184
aVaimed \u2014 and it's controlled global action \u2014
p185
aVaimed at a global good.
p186
aVAnd,
p187
aVas we've learned with the money-printing schemes,
p188
aVwhatever concerns we have can be allayed by rules.
p189
aa(lp190
VSo, for example,
p191
aVthe issuance of these extra SDRs every five years could be capped,
p192
aVsuch that this international currency is never more than five percent
p193
aVof global foreign exchange reserves.
p194
aVThat's important because it would allay
p195
aVwell, let's say, the ridiculous concerns that the US might have
p196
aVthat the SDR could ever challenge the dollar's dominant role
p197
aVin international finance.
p198
aVAnd in fact,
p199
aVI think the only thing that the SDR would likely steal from the dollar
p200
aVunder this scheme
p201
aVis its nickname, the "greenback."
p202
aVBecause even with that cap in place,
p203
aVthe IMF could have followed up its issuance \u2014
p204
aVits massive issuance of SDRs in 2009 \u2014
p205
aVwith a further 200 billion dollars of SDRs in 2014.
p206
aa(lp207
VSo hypothetically,
p208
aVthat would mean that developed countries could have contributed
p209
aVup to 300 billion dollars' worth of SDRs
p210
aVto the Green Climate Fund.
p211
aVThat's 30 times what it has today.
p212
aVAnd you know,
p213
aVas spectacular as that sounds,
p214
aVit's only just beginning to look like "whatever it takes."
p215
aa(lp216
VAnd just to think what amazing things could be done with that money,
p217
aVconsider this:
p218
aVin 2009,
p219
aVNorway promised one billion dollars of its reserves to Brazil
p220
aVif they followed through on their goals on deforestation.
p221
aVThat program has since delivered a 70 percent reduction in deforestation
p222
aVin the past decade.
p223
aVThat's saving 3.2 billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions,
p224
aVwhich is the equivalent of taking all American cars off the roads
p225
aVfor three whole years.
p226
aVSo what could we do
p227
aVwith 300 other pay-for-performance climate projects like that,
p228
aVorganized on a global scale?
p229
aVWe could take cars off the roads for a generation.
p230
aa(lp231
VSo,
p232
aVlet's not quibble about whether we can afford to fund climate change.
p233
aVThe real question is:
p234
aVDo we care enough about future generations
p235
aVto take the very same policy risks we took to save the financial system?
p236
aVAfter all,
p237
aVwe could do it,
p238
aVwe did do it
p239
aVand we are doing it today.
p240
aa(lp241
VWe must, must, must do "whatever it takes."
p242
aa(lp243
VThank you.
