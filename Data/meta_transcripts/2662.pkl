VWhen I was a child, I knew I had superpowers.
p4
aVThat's right.
p5
aa(lp6
V(Laughter)
p7
aa(lp8
VI thought I was absolutely amazing because I could understand
p9
aVand relate to the feelings of brown people,
p10
aVlike my grandfather, a conservative Muslim guy.
p11
aVAnd also, I could understand my Afghan mother, my Pakistani father,
p12
aVnot so religious but laid-back, fairly liberal.
p13
aVAnd of course, I could understand
p14
aVand relate to the feelings of white people.
p15
aVThe white Norwegians of my country.
p16
aVYou know, white, brown, whatever \u2014
p17
aVI loved them all.
p18
aVI understood them all,
p19
aVeven if they didn't always understand each other;
p20
aVthey were all my people.
p21
aa(lp22
VMy father, though, was always really worried.
p23
aVHe kept saying that even with the best education,
p24
aVI was not going to get a fair shake.
p25
aVI would still face discrimination, according to him.
p26
aVAnd that the only way to be accepted by white people
p27
aVwould be to become famous.
p28
aVNow, mind you, he had this conversation with me when I was seven years old.
p29
aVSo while I'm seven years old, he said,
p30
aV"Look, so it's either got to be sports, or it's got to be music."
p31
aVHe didn't know anything about sports \u2014 bless him \u2014 so it was music.
p32
aVSo when I was seven years old, he gathered all my toys, all my dolls,
p33
aVand he threw them all away.
p34
aVIn exchange he gave me a crappy little Casio keyboard and \u2014
p35
aa(lp36
V(Laughter)
p37
aa(lp38
VYeah. And singing lessons.
p39
aVAnd he forced me, basically, to practice for hours and hours every single day.
p40
aVVery quickly, he also had me performing for larger and larger audiences,
p41
aVand bizarrely, I became almost a kind of poster child
p42
aVfor Norwegian multiculturalism.
p43
aVI felt very proud, of course.
p44
aVBecause even the newspapers at this point
p45
aVwere starting to write nice things about brown people,
p46
aVso I could feel that my superpower was growing.
p47
aa(lp48
VSo when I was 12 years old, walking home from school,
p49
aVI took a little detour
p50
aVbecause I wanted to buy my favorite sweets called "salty feet."
p51
aVI know they sound kind of awful,
p52
aVbut I absolutely love them.
p53
aVThey're basically these little salty licorice bits in the shape of feet.
p54
aVAnd now that I say it out loud, I realize how terrible that sounds,
p55
aVbut be that as it may, I absolutely love them.
p56
aVSo on my way into the store,
p57
aVthere was this grown white guy in the doorway blocking my way.
p58
aVSo I tried to walk around him, and as I did that, he stopped me
p59
aVand he was staring at me,
p60
aVand he spit in my face, and he said,
p61
aV"Get out of my way
p62
aVyou little black bitch, you little Paki bitch,
p63
aVgo back home where you came from."
p64
aVI was absolutely horrified.
p65
aVI was staring at him.
p66
aVI was too afraid to wipe the spit off my face,
p67
aVeven as it was mixing with my tears.
p68
aVI remember looking around, hoping that any minute now,
p69
aVa grown-up is going to come and make this guy stop.
p70
aVBut instead, people kept hurrying past me and pretended not to see me.
p71
aVI was very confused because I was thinking, well,
p72
aV"My white people, come on! Where are they? What's going on?
p73
aVHow come they're not coming and rescuing me?"
p74
aVSo, needless to say, I didn't buy the sweets.
p75
aVI just ran home as fast as I could.
p76
aa(lp77
VThings were still OK, though, I thought.
p78
aVAs time went on, the more successful I became,
p79
aVI eventually started also attracting harassment from brown people.
p80
aVSome men in my parent's community felt that it was unacceptable
p81
aVand dishonorable for a woman to be involved in music
p82
aVand to be so present in the media.
p83
aVSo very quickly, I was starting to become attacked at my own concerts.
p84
aVI remember one of the concerts, I was onstage, I lean into the audience
p85
aVand the last thing I see is a young brown face,
p86
aVand the next thing I know is some sort of chemical is thrown in my eyes
p87
aVand I remember I couldn't really see and my eyes were watering
p88
aVbut I kept singing anyway.
p89
aVI was spit in the face in the streets of Oslo, this time by brown men.
p90
aVThey even tried to kidnap me at one point.
p91
aVThe death threats were endless.
p92
aVI remember one older bearded guy stopped me in the street one time,
p93
aVand he said, "The reason I hate you so much
p94
aVis because you make our daughters think
p95
aVthey can do whatever they want."
p96
aVA younger guy warned me to watch my back.
p97
aVHe said music is un-Islamic and the job of whores,
p98
aVand if you keep this up, you are going to be raped
p99
aVand your stomach will be cut out so that another whore like you will not be born.
p100
aa(lp101
VAgain, I was so confused.
p102
aVI couldn't understand what was going on.
p103
aVMy brown people now starting to treat me like this \u2014 how come?
p104
aVInstead of bridging the worlds, the two worlds,
p105
aVI felt like I was falling between my two worlds.
p106
aVI suppose, for me, spit was kryptonite.
p107
aa(lp108
VSo by the time I was 17 years old,
p109
aVthe death threats were endless, and the harassment was constant.
p110
aVIt got so bad, at one point my mother sat me down and said,
p111
aV"Look, we can no longer protect you, we can no longer keep you safe,
p112
aVso you're going to have to go."
p113
aVSo I bought a one-way ticket to London, I packed my suitcase and I left.
p114
aVMy biggest heartbreak at that point was that nobody said anything.
p115
aVI had a very public exit from Norway.
p116
aVMy brown people, my white people \u2014 nobody said anything.
p117
aVNobody said, "Hold on, this is wrong.
p118
aVSupport this girl, protect this girl, because she is one of us."
p119
aVNobody said that.
p120
aVInstead, I felt like \u2014 you know at the airport,
p121
aVon the baggage carousel you have these different suitcases
p122
aVgoing around and around,
p123
aVand there's always that one suitcase left at the end,
p124
aVthe one that nobody wants, the one that nobody comes to claim.
p125
aVI felt like that.
p126
aVI'd never felt so alone. I'd never felt so lost.
p127
aa(lp128
VSo, after coming to London, I did eventually resume my music career.
p129
aVDifferent place, but unfortunately the same old story.
p130
aVI remember a message sent to me saying that I was going to be killed
p131
aVand that rivers of blood were going to flow
p132
aVand that I was going to be raped many times before I died.
p133
aVBy this point, I have to say,
p134
aVI was actually getting used to messages like this,
p135
aVbut what became different was that now they started threatening my family.
p136
aa(lp137
VSo once again, I packed my suitcase, I left music and I moved to the US.
p138
aVI'd had enough.
p139
aVI didn't want to have anything to do with this anymore.
p140
aVAnd I was certainly not going to be killed for something
p141
aVthat wasn't even my dream \u2014 it was my father's choice.
p142
aa(lp143
VSo I kind of got lost.
p144
aVI kind of fell apart.
p145
aVBut I decided that what I wanted to do
p146
aVis spend the next however many years of my life
p147
aVsupporting young people
p148
aVand to try to be there in some small way,
p149
aVwhatever way that I could.
p150
aVI started volunteering for various organizations
p151
aVthat were working with young Muslims inside of Europe.
p152
aVAnd, to my surprise, what I found was
p153
aVso many of these young people were suffering and struggling.
p154
aVThey were facing so many problems with their families and their communities
p155
aVwho seemed to care more about their honor and their reputation
p156
aVthan the happiness and the lives of their own kids.
p157
aVI started feeling like maybe I wasn't so alone, maybe I wasn't so weird.
p158
aVMaybe there are more of my people out there.
p159
aa(lp160
VThe thing is, what most people don't understand
p161
aVis that there are so many of us growing up in Europe
p162
aVwho are not free to be ourselves.
p163
aVWe're not allowed to be who we are.
p164
aVWe are not free to marry
p165
aVor to be in relationships with people that we choose.
p166
aVWe can't even pick our own career.
p167
aVThis is the norm in the Muslim heartlands of Europe.
p168
aVEven in the freest societies in the world, we're not free.
p169
aVOur lives, our dreams, our future does not belong to us,
p170
aVit belongs to our parents and their community.
p171
aVI found endless stories of young people
p172
aVwho are lost to all of us,
p173
aVwho are invisible to all of us
p174
aVbut who are suffering, and they are suffering alone.
p175
aVKids we are losing to forced marriages, to honor-based violence and abuse.
p176
aa(lp177
VEventually, I realized after several years of working with these young people,
p178
aVthat I will not be able to keep running.
p179
aVI can't spend the rest of my life being scared and hiding
p180
aVand that I'm actually going to have to do something.
p181
aVAnd I also realized that my silence, our silence,
p182
aVallows abuse like this to continue.
p183
aVSo I decided that I wanted to put my childhood superpower to some use
p184
aVby trying to make people on the different sides of these issues understand
p185
aVwhat it's like to be a young person stuck between your family and your country.
p186
aa(lp187
VSo I started making films, and I started telling these stories.
p188
aVAnd I also wanted people to understand the deadly consequences of us
p189
aVnot taking these problems seriously.
p190
aa(lp191
VSo the first film I made was about Banaz.
p192
aVShe was a 17-year-old Kurdish girl in London.
p193
aVShe was obedient, she did whatever her parents wanted.
p194
aVShe tried to do everything right.
p195
aVShe married some guy that her parents chose for her,
p196
aVeven though he beat and raped her constantly.
p197
aVAnd when she tried to go to her family for help, they said,
p198
aV"Well, you got to go back and be a better wife."
p199
aVBecause they didn't want a divorced daughter on their hands
p200
aVbecause, of course, that would bring dishonor on the family.
p201
aVShe was beaten so badly her ears would bleed,
p202
aVand when she finally left and she found a young man that she chose
p203
aVand she fell in love with,
p204
aVthe community and the family found out
p205
aVand she disappeared.
p206
aVShe was found three months later.
p207
aVShe'd been stuffed into a suitcase and buried underneath the house.
p208
aVShe had been strangled, she had been beaten to death
p209
aVby three men, three cousins, on the orders of her father and uncle.
p210
aVThe added tragedy of Banaz's story
p211
aVis that she had gone to the police in England five times asking for help,
p212
aVtelling them that she was going to be killed by her family.
p213
aVThe police didn't believe her so they didn't do anything.
p214
aa(lp215
VAnd the problem with this
p216
aVis that not only are so many of our kids facing these problems
p217
aVwithin their families and within their families' communities,
p218
aVbut they're also meeting misunderstandings
p219
aVand apathy in the countries that they grow up in.
p220
aVWhen their own families betray them, they look to the rest of us,
p221
aVand when we don't understand,
p222
aVwe lose them.
p223
aa(lp224
VSo while I was making this film, several people said to me,
p225
aV"Well, Deeyah, you know, this is just their culture,
p226
aVthis is just what those people do to their kids
p227
aVand we can't really interfere."
p228
aVI can assure you being murdered is not my culture.
p229
aVYou know?
p230
aVAnd surely people who look like me,
p231
aVyoung women who come from backgrounds like me,
p232
aVshould be subject to the same rights, the same protections
p233
aVas anybody else in our country, why not?
p234
aa(lp235
VSo, for my next film, I wanted to try and understand
p236
aVwhy some of our young Muslim kids in Europe
p237
aVare drawn to extremism and violence.
p238
aVBut with that topic,
p239
aVI also recognized that I was going to have to face my worst fear:
p240
aVthe brown men with beards.
p241
aVThe same men, or similar men,
p242
aVto the ones that have hounded me for most of my life.
p243
aVMen that I've been afraid of most of my life.
p244
aVMen that I've also deeply disliked,
p245
aVfor many, many years.
p246
aa(lp247
VSo I spent the next two years interviewing convicted terrorists,
p248
aVjihadis and former extremists.
p249
aVWhat I already knew, what was very obvious already,
p250
aVwas that religion, politics, Europe's colonial baggage,
p251
aValso Western foreign policy failures of recent years,
p252
aVwere all a part of the picture.
p253
aVBut what I was more interested in finding out was what are the human,
p254
aVwhat are the personal reasons
p255
aVwhy some of our young people are susceptible to groups like this.
p256
aVAnd what really surprised me was that I found wounded human beings.
p257
aVInstead of the monsters that I was looking for,
p258
aVthat I was hoping to find \u2014
p259
aVquite frankly because it would have been very satisfying \u2014
p260
aVI found broken people.
p261
aVJust like Banaz,
p262
aVI found that these young men were torn apart
p263
aVfrom trying to bridge the gaps
p264
aVbetween their families and the countries that they were born in.
p265
aVAnd what I also learned is that extremist groups, terrorist groups
p266
aVare taking advantage of these feelings of our young people
p267
aVand channeling that \u2014 cynically \u2014 channeling that toward violence.
p268
aV"Come to us," they say.
p269
aV"Reject both sides, your family and your country
p270
aVbecause they reject you.
p271
aVFor your family, their honor is more important than you
p272
aVand for your country,
p273
aVa real Norwegian, Brit or a French person will always be white and never you."
p274
aVThey're also promising our young people the things that they crave:
p275
aVsignificance, heroism, a sense of belonging and purpose,
p276
aVa community that loves and accepts them.
p277
aVThey make the powerless feel powerful.
p278
aVThe invisible and the silent are finally seen and heard.
p279
aVThis is what they're doing for our young people.
p280
aVWhy are these groups doing this for our young people and not us?
p281
aa(lp282
VThe thing is,
p283
aVI'm not trying to justify
p284
aVor excuse any of the violence.
p285
aVWhat I am trying to say is that we have to understand
p286
aVwhy some of our young people are attracted to this.
p287
aVI would like to also show you, actually \u2014
p288
aVthese are childhood photos of some of the guys in the film.
p289
aVWhat really struck me is that so many of them \u2014
p290
aVI never would have thought this \u2014
p291
aVbut so many of them have absent or abusive fathers.
p292
aVAnd several of these young guys
p293
aVended up finding caring and compassionate father figures
p294
aVwithin these extremist groups.
p295
aVI also found men brutalized by racist violence,
p296
aVbut who found a way to stop feeling like victims
p297
aVby becoming violent themselves.
p298
aVIn fact, I found something, to my horror, that I recognized.
p299
aVI found the same feelings that I felt as a 17-year-old as I fled from Norway.
p300
aVThe same confusion, the same sorrow,
p301
aVthe same feeling of being betrayed
p302
aVand not belonging to anyone.
p303
aVThe same feeling of being lost and torn between cultures.
p304
aa(lp305
VHaving said that, I did not choose destruction,
p306
aVI chose to pick up a camera instead of a gun.
p307
aVAnd the reason I did that is because of my superpower.
p308
aVI could see that understanding is the answer, instead of violence.
p309
aVSeeing human beings
p310
aVwith all their virtues and all their flaws
p311
aVinstead of continuing the caricatures:
p312
aVthe us and them, the villains and victims.
p313
aVI'd also finally come to terms with the fact
p314
aVthat my two cultures didn't have to be on a collision course
p315
aVbut instead became a space where I found my own voice.
p316
aVI stopped feeling like I had to pick a side,
p317
aVbut this took me many, many years.
p318
aVThere are so many of our young people today
p319
aVwho are struggling with these same issues,
p320
aVand they're struggling with this alone.
p321
aVAnd this leaves them open like wounds.
p322
aVAnd for some, the worldview of radical Islam
p323
aVbecomes the infection that festers in these open wounds.
p324
aa(lp325
VThere's an African proverb that says,
p326
aV"If the young are not initiated into the village,
p327
aVthey will burn it down just to feel its warmth."
p328
aVI would like to ask \u2014
p329
aVto Muslim parents and Muslim communities,
p330
aVwill you love and care for your children
p331
aVwithout forcing them to meet your expectations?
p332
aVCan you choose them instead of your honor?
p333
aVCan you understand why they're so angry and alienated
p334
aVwhen you put your honor before their happiness?
p335
aVCan you try to be a friend to your child
p336
aVso that they can trust you
p337
aVand want to share with you their experiences,
p338
aVrather than having to seek it somewhere else?
p339
aa(lp340
VAnd to our young people tempted by extremism,
p341
aVcan you acknowledge that your rage is fueled by pain?
p342
aVWill you find the strength to resist those cynical old men
p343
aVwho want to use your blood for their own profits?
p344
aVCan you find a way to live?
p345
aVCan you see that the sweetest revenge
p346
aVis for you to live a happy, full and free life?
p347
aVA life defined by you and nobody else.
p348
aVWhy do you want to become just another dead Muslim kid?
p349
aVAnd for the rest of us, when will we start listening to our young people?
p350
aVHow can we support them
p351
aVin redirecting their pain into something more constructive?
p352
aVThey think we don't like them.
p353
aVThey think we don't care what happens to them.
p354
aVThey think we don't accept them.
p355
aVCan we find a way to make them feel differently?
p356
aVWhat will it take for us to see them and notice them
p357
aVbefore they become either the victims or the perpetrators of violence?
p358
aVCan we make ourselves care about them and consider them to be our own?
p359
aVAnd not just be outraged when the victims of violence look like ourselves?
p360
aVCan we find a way to reject hatred and heal the divisions between us?
p361
aVThe thing is we cannot afford to give up on each other or on our kids,
p362
aVeven if they've given up on us.
p363
aa(lp364
VWe are all in this together.
p365
aVAnd in the long term, revenge and violence will not work against extremists.
p366
aVTerrorists want us to huddle in our houses in fear,
p367
aVclosing our doors and our hearts.
p368
aVThey want us to tear open more wounds in our societies
p369
aVso that they can use them to spread their infection more widely.
p370
aVThey want us to become like them:
p371
aVintolerant, hateful and cruel.
p372
aa(lp373
VThe day after the Paris attacks,
p374
aVa friend of mine sent this photo of her daughter.
p375
aVThis is a white girl and an Arab girl.
p376
aVThey're best friends.
p377
aVThis image is the kryptonite for extremists.
p378
aVThese two little girls with their superpowers
p379
aVare showing the way forward
p380
aVtowards a society that we need to build together,
p381
aVa society that includes and supports,
p382
aVrather than rejects our kids.
p383
