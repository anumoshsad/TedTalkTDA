VMy name is Joseph, a Member of Parliament in Kenya.
p4
aVPicture a Maasai village,
p5
aVand one evening,
p6
aVgovernment soldiers come, surround the village
p7
aVand ask each elder to bring one boy to school.
p8
aVThat's how I went to school \u2014
p9
aVpretty much a government guy pointing a gun
p10
aVand told my father, "You have to make a choice."
p11
aVI walked very comfortably to this missionary school,
p12
aVthat was run by an American missionary.
p13
aVThe first thing the American missionary gave me was a candy.
p14
aVI had never in my life ever tasted candy.
p15
aVSo I said to myself, with all these hundred other boys,
p16
aVthis is where I belong.
p17
aa(lp18
V(Laughter) I stayed.
p19
aa(lp20
VWhen everybody else was dropping out.
p21
aVMy family moved; we're nomads.
p22
aVIt was a boarding school, I was seven \u2014
p23
aVEvery time it closed you had to travel to find them.
p24
aV40-50 miles, it doesn't matter.
p25
aVYou slept in the bush, but you kept going.
p26
aa(lp27
VAnd I stayed. I don't know why, but I did.
p28
aVAll of a sudden I passed the national examination,
p29
aVfound myself in a very beautiful high school in Kenya.
p30
aVAnd I finished high school.
p31
aVAnd just walking, I found a man
p32
aVwho gave me a full scholarship to the United States.
p33
aVMy mother still lived in a cow-dung hut,
p34
aVnone of my brothers were going to school,
p35
aVand this man told me, "Here, go."
p36
aa(lp37
VI got a scholarship
p38
aVto St. Lawrence University, Upstate New York;
p39
aVfinished that.
p40
aVAnd after that I went to Harvard Graduate School;
p41
aVfinished that.
p42
aVThen I worked in DC a little bit:
p43
aVI wrote a book for National Geographic and taught U.S. history.
p44
aVAnd every time, I kept going back home,
p45
aVlistening to their problems \u2014
p46
aVsick people, people with no water, all this stuff \u2014
p47
aVevery time I go back to America,
p48
aVI kept thinking about them.
p49
aa(lp50
VThen one day, an elder gave me a story that went like this:
p51
aVlong time ago, there was a big war between tribes.
p52
aVThis specific tribe was really afraid of this other Luhya tribe.
p53
aVEvery time, they sent scouts to make sure no one attacked them.
p54
aVSo one day, the scouts came running and told the villagers,
p55
aV"The enemies are coming. Only half an hour away, they'll be here."
p56
aVSo people scrambled, took their things and ready to go, move out.
p57
aVBut there were two men:
p58
aVone man was blind, one man had no legs
p59
aV\u2014 he was born like that.
p60
aVThe leader of the chiefs said, "No, sorry. We can't take you. You'll slow us down.
p61
aVWe have to flee our women and children, we have to run."
p62
aVAnd they were left behind, waiting to die.
p63
aa(lp64
VBut these two people worked something out.
p65
aVThe blind man said, "Look, I'm a very strong man but I can't see."
p66
aVThe man with no legs says, "I can see as far as the end of the world,
p67
aVbut I can't save myself from a cat, or whatever animals."
p68
aVThe blind man went down on his knees like this,
p69
aVand told the man with no legs to go over his back, and stood up.
p70
aVThe man on top can see, the blind man can walk.
p71
aVThese guys took off, followed the footsteps of the villagers
p72
aVuntil they found and passed them.
p73
aa(lp74
VSo, this was told to me in a setup of elders.
p75
aVAnd it's a really poor area.
p76
aVI represent Northern Kenya:
p77
aVthe most nomadic, remote areas you can even find.
p78
aVAnd that man told me, "So, here you are.
p79
aVYou've got a good education from America, you have a good life in America;
p80
aVwhat are you going to do for us?
p81
aVWe want you to be our eyes, we'll give you the legs.
p82
aVWe'll walk you, you lead us."
p83
aa(lp84
VThe opportunity came. I was always thinking about that:
p85
aV"What can I do to help my people?
p86
aVEvery time you go to an area where for 43 years of independence,
p87
aVwe still don't have basic health facilities.
p88
aVA man has to be transported in a wheelbarrow 30 km for a hospital.
p89
aVNo clean drinking water.
p90
aa(lp91
VSo I said, "I'm going to dedicate myself.
p92
aVI'm leaving America.
p93
aVI'm going to run for office."
p94
aVLast June, I moved from America,
p95
aVran in July election and won.
p96
aVAnd I came for them,
p97
aVand that's my goal.
p98
aa(lp99
VRight now I have in place, for the last nine months,
p100
aVa plan that in five years,
p101
aVevery nomad will have clean drinking water.
p102
aVWe're building dispensaries across that constituency.
p103
aVI'm asking my friends from America to help
p104
aVwith bringing nurses or doctors to help us out.
p105
aVI'm trying to improve infrastructure.
p106
aVI'm using the knowledge I received from the United States
p107
aVand from my community
p108
aVto move them forward.
p109
aVI'm trying to develop homegrown solutions to our issues
p110
aVbecause people from outside can come and help us,
p111
aVbut if we don't help ourselves, there's nothing to do.
p112
aa(lp113
VMy plan right now
p114
aVas I continue with introducing students to different fields \u2014
p115
aVsome become doctors, some lawyers \u2014
p116
aVwe want to produce a comprehensive group of people,
p117
aVstudents who can come back and help us see a community grow
p118
aVthat is in the middle of a huge economic recession.
p119
aa(lp120
VAs I continue to be a Member of Parliament
p121
aVand as I continue listening to all of you talking about botany,
p122
aVhealth, democracy, new inventions,
p123
aVI'm hoping that one day in my own little community \u2014
p124
aVwhich is 26,000 square km,
p125
aVmaybe five times Rhode Island \u2014
p126
aVwith no roads,
p127
aVwe'll be able to become a model to help others develop.
p128
aa(lp129
VThank you very much.
