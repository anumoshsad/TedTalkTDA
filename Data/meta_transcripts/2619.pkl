VHalf of the human workforce is expected to be replaced
p4
aVby software and robots in the next 20 years.
p5
aVAnd many corporate leaders welcome that as a chance to increase profits.
p6
aVMachines are more efficient;
p7
aVhumans are complicated and difficult to manage.
p8
aa(lp9
VWell, I want our organizations to remain human.
p10
aVIn fact, I want them to become beautiful.
p11
aVBecause as machines take our jobs and do them more efficiently,
p12
aVsoon the only work left for us humans will be the kind of work
p13
aVthat must be done beautifully rather than efficiently.
p14
aa(lp15
VTo maintain our humanity in the this second Machine Age,
p16
aVwe may have no other choice than to create beauty.
p17
aVBeauty is an elusive concept.
p18
aVFor the writer Stendhal it was the promise of happiness.
p19
aVFor me it's a goal by Lionel Messi.
p20
aa(lp21
V(Laughter)
p22
aa(lp23
VSo bear with me
p24
aVas I am proposing four admittedly very subjective principles
p25
aVthat you can use to build a beautiful organization.
p26
aa(lp27
VFirst: do the unnecessary.

VA few months ago, Hamdi Ulukaya,
p32
aVthe CEO and founder of the yogurt company Chobani,
p33
aVmade headlines when he decided to grant stock to all of his 2,000 employees.
p34
aVSome called it a PR stunt,
p35
aVothers \u2014 a genuine act of giving back.
p36
aVBut there is something else that was remarkable about it.
p37
aVIt came completely out of the blue.
p38
aVThere had been no market or stakeholder pressure,
p39
aVand employees were so surprised
p40
aVthat they burst into tears when they heard the news.
p41
aVActions like Ulukaya's are beautiful because they catch us off guard.
p42
aVThey create something out of nothing
p43
aVbecause they're completely unnecessary.
p44
aa(lp45
VI once worked at a company
p46
aVthat was the result of a merger
p47
aVof a large IT outsourcing firm and a small design firm.
p48
aVWe were merging 9,000 software engineers
p49
aVwith 1,000 creative types.
p50
aVAnd to unify these immensely different cultures,
p51
aVwe were going to launch a third, new brand.
p52
aVAnd the new brand color was going to be orange.
p53
aVAnd as we were going through the budget for the rollouts,
p54
aVwe decided last minute
p55
aVto cut the purchase of 10,000 orange balloons,
p56
aVwhich we had meant to distribute to all staff worldwide.
p57
aVThey just seemed unnecessary and cute in the end.
p58
aVI didn't know back then
p59
aVthat our decision marked the beginning of the end \u2014
p60
aVthat these two organizations would never become one.
p61
aVAnd sure enough, the merger eventually failed.
p62
aVNow, was it because there weren't any orange balloons?
p63
aVNo, of course not.
p64
aVBut the kill-the-orange-balloons mentality permeated everything else.
p65
aVYou might not always realize it, but when you cut the unnecessary,
p66
aVyou cut everything.
p67
aVLeading with beauty means rising above what is merely necessary.
p68
aVSo do not kill your orange balloons.
p69
aa(lp70
VThe second principle:
p71
aVcreate intimacy.
p72
aa(lp73
V[Create Intimacy]
p74
aa(lp75
VStudies show that how we feel about our workplace
p76
aVvery much depends on the relationships with our coworkers.
p77
aVAnd what are relationships other than a string of microinteractions?
p78
aVThere are hundreds of these every day in our organizations
p79
aVthat have the potential to distinguish a good life from a beautiful one.
p80
aVThe marriage researcher John Gottman says
p81
aVthat the secret of a healthy relationship
p82
aVis not the great gesture or the lofty promise,
p83
aVit's small moments of attachment.
p84
aVIn other words, intimacy.
p85
aVIn our networked organizations,
p86
aVwe tout the strength of weak ties
p87
aVbut we underestimate the strength of strong ones.
p88
aVWe forget the words of the writer Richard Bach who once said,
p89
aV"Intimacy \u2014
p90
aVnot connectedness \u2014
p91
aVintimacy is the opposite of loneliness."
p92
aa(lp93
VSo how do we design for organizational intimacy?
p94
aVThe humanitarian organization CARE
p95
aVwanted to launch a campaign on gender equality
p96
aVin villages in northern India.
p97
aVBut it realized quickly
p98
aVthat it had to have this conversation first with its own staff.
p99
aVSo it invited all 36 team members and their partners
p100
aVto one of the Khajuraho Temples,
p101
aVknown for their famous erotic sculptures.
p102
aVAnd there they openly discussed their personal relationships \u2014
p103
aVtheir own experiences of gender equality
p104
aVwith the coworkers and the partners.
p105
aVIt was eye-opening for the participants.
p106
aVNot only did it allow them to relate to the communities they serve,
p107
aVit also broke down invisible barriers
p108
aVand created a lasting bond amongst themselves.
p109
aVNot a single team member quit in the next four years.
p110
aVSo this is how you create intimacy.
p111
aVNo masks ...
p112
aVor lots of masks.
p113
aa(lp114
V(Laughter)
p115
aa(lp116
VWhen Danone, the food company,
p117
aVwanted to translate its new company manifesto into product initiatives,
p118
aVit gathered the management team
p119
aVand 100 employees from across different departments,
p120
aVseniority levels and regions
p121
aVfor a three-day strategy retreat.
p122
aVAnd it asked everybody to wear costumes for the entire meeting:
p123
aVwigs, crazy hats, feather boas,
p124
aVhuge glasses and so on.
p125
aVAnd they left with concrete outcomes
p126
aVand full of enthusiasm.
p127
aVAnd when I asked the woman who had designed this experience
p128
aVwhy it worked,
p129
aVshe simply said, "Never underestimate the power of a ridiculous wig."
p130
aa(lp131
V(Laughter)
p132
aa(lp133
V(Applause)
p134
aa(lp135
VBecause wigs erase hierarchy,
p136
aVand hierarchy kills intimacy \u2014
p137
aVboth ways,
p138
aVfor the CEO and the intern.
p139
aVWigs allow us to use the disguise of the false
p140
aVto show something true about ourselves.
p141
aVAnd that's not easy in our everyday work lives,
p142
aVbecause the relationship with our organizations
p143
aVis often like that of a married couple that has grown apart,
p144
aVsuffered betrayals and disappointments,
p145
aVand is now desperate to be beautiful for one another once again.
p146
aVAnd for either of us the first step towards beauty involves a huge risk.
p147
aVThe risk to be ugly.
p148
aa(lp149
V[Be Ugly]
p150
aa(lp151
VSo many organizations these days are keen on designing beautiful workplaces
p152
aVthat look like anything but work:
p153
aVvacation resorts, coffee shops, playgrounds or college campuses \u2014
p154
aa(lp155
V(Laughter)
p156
aa(lp157
VBased on the promises of positive psychology,
p158
aVwe speak of play and gamification,
p159
aVand one start-up even says that when someone gets fired,
p160
aVthey have graduated.
p161
aa(lp162
V(Laughter)
p163
aa(lp164
VThat kind of beautiful language only goes "skin deep,
p165
aVbut ugly cuts clean to the bone,"
p166
aVas the writer Dorothy Parker once put it.
p167
aVTo be authentic is to be ugly.
p168
aVIt doesn't mean that you can't have fun or must give in to the vulgar or cynical,
p169
aVbut it does mean that you speak the actual ugly truth.
p170
aVLike this manufacturer
p171
aVthat wanted to transform one of its struggling business units.
p172
aVIt identified, named and pinned on large boards all the issues \u2014
p173
aVand there were hundreds of them \u2014
p174
aVthat had become obstacles to better performance.
p175
aVThey put them on boards, moved them all into one room,
p176
aVwhich they called "the ugly room."
p177
aVThe ugly became visible for everyone to see \u2014
p178
aVit was celebrated.
p179
aVAnd the ugly room served as a mix of mirror exhibition and operating room \u2014
p180
aVa biopsy on the living flesh to cut out all the bureaucracy.
p181
aa(lp182
VThe ugliest part of our body is our brain.
p183
aVLiterally and neurologically.
p184
aVOur brain renders ugly what is unfamiliar ...
p185
aVmodern art, atonal music,
p186
aVjazz, maybe \u2014
p187
aVVR goggles for that matter \u2014
p188
aVstrange objects, sounds and people.
p189
aVBut we've all been ugly once.
p190
aVWe were a weird-looking baby,
p191
aVa new kid on the block, a foreigner.
p192
aVAnd we will be ugly again when we don't belong.
p193
aa(lp194
VThe Center for Political Beauty,
p195
aVan activist collective in Berlin,
p196
aVrecently staged an extreme artistic intervention.
p197
aVWith the permission of relatives,
p198
aVit exhumed the corpses of refugees who had drowned at Europe's borders,
p199
aVtransported them all the way to Berlin,
p200
aVand then reburied them at the heart of the German capital.
p201
aVThe idea was to allow them to reach their desired destination,
p202
aVif only after their death.
p203
aVSuch acts of beautification may not be pretty,
p204
aVbut they are much needed.
p205
aVBecause things tend to get ugly when there's only one meaning, one truth,
p206
aVonly answers and no questions.
p207
aVBeautiful organizations keep asking questions.
p208
aVThey remain incomplete,
p209
aVwhich is the fourth and the last of the principles.
p210
aa(lp211
V[Remain Incomplete]
p212
aa(lp213
VRecently I was in Paris,
p214
aVand a friend of mine took me to Nuit Debout,
p215
aVwhich stands for "up all night,"
p216
aVthe self-organized protest movement
p217
aVthat had formed in response to the proposed labor laws in France.
p218
aVEvery night, hundreds gathered at the Place de la République.
p219
aVEvery night they set up a small, temporary village
p220
aVto deliberate their own vision of the French Republic.
p221
aVAnd at the core of this adhocracy
p222
aVwas a general assembly where anybody could speak
p223
aVusing a specially designed sign language.
p224
aVLike Occupy Wall Street and other protest movements,
p225
aVNuit Debout was born in the face of crisis.
p226
aVIt was messy \u2014
p227
aVfull of controversies and contradictions.
p228
aVBut whether you agreed with the movement's goals or not,
p229
aVevery gathering was a beautiful lesson in raw humanity.
p230
aVAnd how fitting that Paris \u2014
p231
aVthe city of ideals, the city of beauty \u2014
p232
aVwas it's stage.
p233
aVIt reminds us that like great cities,
p234
aVthe most beautiful organizations are ideas worth fighting for \u2014
p235
aVeven and especially when their outcome is uncertain.
p236
aVThey are movements;
p237
aVthey are always imperfect, never fully organized,
p238
aVso they avoid ever becoming banal.
p239
aVThey have something but we don't know what it is.
p240
aVThey remain mysterious; we can't take our eyes off them.
p241
aVWe find them beautiful.
p242
aa(lp243
VSo to do the unnecessary,
p244
aVto create intimacy,
p245
aVto be ugly,
p246
aVto remain incomplete \u2014
p247
aVthese are not only the qualities of beautiful organizations,
p248
aVthese are inherently human characteristics.
p249
aVAnd these are also the qualities of what we call home.
p250
aVAnd as we disrupt, and are disrupted,
p251
aVthe least we can do is to ensure
p252
aVthat we still feel at home in our organizations,
p253
aVand that we use our organizations to create that feeling for others.
p254
aa(lp255
VBeauty can save the world when we embrace these principles
p256
aVand design for them.
p257
aVIn the face of artificial intelligence and machine learning,
p258
aVwe need a new radical humanism.
p259
aVWe must acquire and promote a new aesthetic and sentimental education.
p260
aVBecause if we don't,
p261
aVwe might end up feeling like aliens
p262
aVin organizations and societies that are full of smart machines
p263
aVthat have no appreciation whatsoever
p264
aVfor the unnecessary,
p265
aVthe intimate,
p266
aVthe incomplete
p267
aVand definitely not for the ugly.
p268
