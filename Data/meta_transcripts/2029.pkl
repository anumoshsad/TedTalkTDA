VTwenty-three years ago,
p4
aVat the age of 19,
p5
aVI shot and killed a man.
p6
aVI was a young drug dealer
p7
aVwith a quick temper
p8
aVand a semi-automatic pistol.
p9
aa(lp10
VBut that wasn't the end of my story.
p11
aVIn fact, it was beginning,
p12
aVand the 23 years since
p13
aVis a story of acknowledgment,
p14
aVapology and atonement.
p15
aVBut it didn't happen in the way
p16
aVthat you might imagine or think.
p17
aVThese things occurred in my life
p18
aVin a way that was surprising,
p19
aVespecially to me.
p20
aa(lp21
VSee, like many of you,
p22
aVgrowing up, I was an honor roll student,
p23
aVa scholarship student,
p24
aVwith dreams of becoming a doctor.
p25
aVBut things went dramatically wrong
p26
aVwhen my parents separated
p27
aVand eventually divorced.
p28
aa(lp29
VThe actual events are pretty straightforward.
p30
aVAt the age of 17,
p31
aVI got shot three times
p32
aVstanding on the corner of my block in Detroit.
p33
aVMy friend rushed me to the hospital.
p34
aVDoctors pulled the bullets out,
p35
aVpatched me up,
p36
aVand sent me back to the same  neighborhood where I got shot.
p37
aVThroughout this ordeal,
p38
aVno one hugged me,
p39
aVno one counseled me,
p40
aVno one told me I would be okay.
p41
aVNo one told me that I would live in fear,
p42
aVthat I would become paranoid,
p43
aVor that I would react hyper-violently
p44
aVto being shot.
p45
aVNo one told me that one day,
p46
aVI would become the person behind the trigger.
p47
aVFourteen months later,
p48
aVat 2 a.m.,
p49
aVI fired the shots
p50
aVthat caused a man's death.
p51
aa(lp52
VWhen I entered prison,
p53
aVI was bitter, I was angry, I was hurt.
p54
aVI didn't want to take responsibility.
p55
aVI blamed everybody from my parents
p56
aVto the system.
p57
aVI rationalized my decision to shoot
p58
aVbecause in the hood where I come from,
p59
aVit's better to be the shooter
p60
aVthan the person getting shot.
p61
aVAs I sat in my cold cell,
p62
aVI felt helpless,
p63
aVunloved and abandoned.
p64
aVI felt like nobody cared,
p65
aVand I reacted
p66
aVwith hostility to my confinement.
p67
aVAnd I found myself getting
p68
aVdeeper and deeper into trouble.
p69
aVI ran black market stores,
p70
aVI loan sharked,
p71
aVand I sold drugs that were illegally smuggled
p72
aVinto the prison.
p73
aVI had in fact become
p74
aVwhat the warden of the Michigan Reformatory called
p75
aV"the worst of the worst."
p76
aVAnd because of my activity,
p77
aVI landed in solitary confinement
p78
aVfor seven and a half years
p79
aVout of my incarceration.
p80
aa(lp81
VNow as I see it, solitary confinement
p82
aVis one of the most inhumane and barbaric places
p83
aVyou can find yourself,
p84
aVbut find myself I did.
p85
aVOne day, I was pacing my cell,
p86
aVwhen an officer came and delivered mail.
p87
aVI looked at a couple of letters
p88
aVbefore I looked at the letter
p89
aVthat had my son's squiggly handwriting on it.
p90
aVAnd anytime I would get a letter from my son,
p91
aVit was like a ray of light
p92
aVin the darkest place you can imagine.
p93
aVAnd on this particular day, I opened this letter,
p94
aVand in capital letters, he wrote,
p95
aV"My mama told me why you was in prison:
p96
aVmurder."
p97
aVHe said, "Dad, don't kill.
p98
aVJesus watches what you do. Pray to Him."
p99
aa(lp100
VNow, I wasn't religious at that time,
p101
aVnor am I religious now,
p102
aVbut it was something so profound
p103
aVabout my son's words.
p104
aVThey made me examine things about my life
p105
aVthat I hadn't considered.
p106
aVIt was the first time in my life
p107
aVthat I had actually thought about the fact
p108
aVthat my son would see me as a murderer.
p109
aVI sat back on my bunk
p110
aVand I reflected on something I had read
p111
aVin [Plato],
p112
aVwhere Socrates stated in "Apology"
p113
aVthat the unexamined life isn't worth living.
p114
aa(lp115
VAt that point is when the transformation began.
p116
aVBut it didn't come easy.
p117
aVOne of the things I realized,
p118
aVwhich was part of the transformation,
p119
aVwas that there were four key things.
p120
aVThe first thing was,
p121
aVI had great mentors.
p122
aVNow, I know some of you all are probably thinking,
p123
aVhow did you find a great mentor in prison?
p124
aVBut in my case,
p125
aVsome of my mentors
p126
aVwho are serving life sentences
p127
aVwere some of the best people to ever come into my life,
p128
aVbecause they forced me to look at my life honestly,
p129
aVand they forced me to challenge myself
p130
aVabout my decision making.
p131
aa(lp132
VThe second thing was literature.
p133
aVPrior to going to prison,
p134
aVI didn't know that there were so many brilliant
p135
aVblack poets, authors and philosophers,
p136
aVand then I had the great fortune
p137
aVof encountering Malcolm X's autobiography,
p138
aVand it shattered every stereotype I had about myself.
p139
aa(lp140
VThe third thing was family.
p141
aVFor 19 years, my father stood by my side
p142
aVwith an unshakable faith,
p143
aVbecause he believed that I had what it took
p144
aVto turn my life around.
p145
aVI also met an amazing woman
p146
aVwho is now the mother of my two-year-old son Sekou,
p147
aVand she taught me how to love myself
p148
aVin a healthy way.
p149
aa(lp150
VThe final thing was writing.
p151
aVWhen I got that letter from my son,
p152
aVI began to write a journal
p153
aVabout things I had experienced in my childhood
p154
aVand in prison,
p155
aVand what it did is it opened up my mind to the idea
p156
aVof atonement.
p157
aVEarlier in my incarceration, I had received
p158
aVa letter from one of the relatives of my victim,
p159
aVand in that letter,
p160
aVshe told me she forgave me,
p161
aVbecause she realized I was a young child
p162
aVwho had been abused
p163
aVand had been through some hardships
p164
aVand just made a series of poor decisions.
p165
aVIt was the first time in my life
p166
aVthat I ever felt open to forgiving myself.
p167
aa(lp168
VOne of the things that happened
p169
aVafter that experience is that
p170
aVI thought about the other men who were incarcerated
p171
aValongside of me,
p172
aVand how much I wanted to share this with them.
p173
aVAnd so I started talking to them about
p174
aVsome of their experiences,
p175
aVand I was devastated to realize
p176
aVthat most of them came from the same abusive environments,
p177
aVAnd most of them wanted help and they wanted to turn it around,
p178
aVbut unfortunately the system
p179
aVthat currently holds 2.5 million people in prison
p180
aVis designed to warehouse
p181
aVas opposed to rehabilitate or transform.
p182
aVSo I made it up in my mind
p183
aVthat if I was ever released from prison
p184
aVthat I would do everything in my power
p185
aVto help change that.
p186
aa(lp187
VIn 2010, I walked out of prison
p188
aVfor the first time after two decades.
p189
aVNow imagine, if you will,
p190
aVFred Flintstone walking into an episode
p191
aVof "The Jetsons."
p192
aVThat was pretty much what my life was like.
p193
aVFor the first time, I was exposed to the Internet,
p194
aVsocial media,
p195
aVcars that talk like KITT from "Knight Rider."
p196
aVBut the thing that fascinated me the most
p197
aVwas phone technology.
p198
aVSee, when I went to prison,
p199
aVour car phones were this big
p200
aVand required two people to carry them.
p201
aVSo imagine what it was like when I first grabbed
p202
aVmy little Blackberry
p203
aVand I started learning how to text.
p204
aVBut the thing is, the people around me,
p205
aVthey didn't realize that I had no idea
p206
aVwhat all these abbreviated texts meant,
p207
aVlike LOL, OMG, LMAO,
p208
aVuntil one day I was having a conversation
p209
aVwith one of my friends via text,
p210
aVand I asked him to do something, and he responded back, "K."
p211
aVAnd I was like, "What is K?"
p212
aVAnd he was like, "K is okay."
p213
aVSo in my head, I was like,
p214
aV"Well what the hell is wrong with K?"
p215
aVAnd so I text him a question mark.
p216
aVAnd he said, "K = okay."
p217
aVAnd so I tap back, "FU." (Laughter)
p218
aVAnd then he texts back, and he asks me
p219
aVwhy was I cussing him out.
p220
aVAnd I said, "LOL FU,"
p221
aVas in, I finally understand.
p222
aV(Laughter)
p223
aa(lp224
VAnd so fast forward three years,
p225
aVI'm doing relatively good.
p226
aVI have a fellowship at MIT Media Lab,
p227
aVI work for an amazing company called BMe,
p228
aVI teach at the University of Michigan,
p229
aVbut it's been a struggle
p230
aVbecause I realize that there are more
p231
aVmen and women coming home
p232
aVwho are not going to be afforded those opportunities.
p233
aVI've been blessed to work with some amazing
p234
aVmen and women,
p235
aVhelping others reenter society,
p236
aVand one of them is my friend named Calvin Evans.
p237
aVHe served 24 years for a crime he didn't commit.
p238
aVHe's 45 years old. He's currently enrolled in college.
p239
aVAnd one of the things that we talked about
p240
aVis the three things that I found important
p241
aVin my personal transformation,
p242
aVthe first being acknowledgment.
p243
aVI had to acknowledge that I had hurt others.
p244
aVI also had to acknowledge that I had been hurt.
p245
aVThe second thing was apologizing.
p246
aVI had to apologize to the people I had hurt.
p247
aVEven though I had no expectations of them accepting it,
p248
aVit was important to do because it was the right thing.
p249
aVBut I also had to apologize to myself.
p250
aVThe third thing was atoning.
p251
aVFor me, atoning meant
p252
aVgoing back into my community
p253
aVand working with at-risk youth
p254
aVwho were on the same path,
p255
aVbut also becoming at one with myself.
p256
aa(lp257
VThrough my experience of being locked up,
p258
aVone of the things I discovered is this:
p259
aVthe majority of men and women
p260
aVwho are incarcerated are redeemable,
p261
aVand the fact is,
p262
aV90 percent of the men and women who are incarcerated
p263
aVwill at some point return to the community,
p264
aVand we have a role in determining what kind
p265
aVof men and women return to our community.
p266
aa(lp267
VMy wish today
p268
aVis that we will embrace
p269
aVa more empathetic approach
p270
aVtoward how we deal with mass incarceration,
p271
aVthat we will do away with
p272
aVthe lock-them-up-and-throw-away-the-key mentality,
p273
aVbecause it's proven it doesn't work.
p274
aa(lp275
VMy journey is a unique journey,
p276
aVbut it doesn't have to be that way.
p277
aVAnybody can have a transformation
p278
aVif we create the space for that to happen.
p279
aVSo what I'm asking today
p280
aVis that you envision
p281
aVa world where men and women
p282
aVaren't held hostage to their pasts,
p283
aVwhere misdeeds and mistakes
p284
aVdon't define you for the rest of your life.
p285
aVI think collectively, we can create that reality,
p286
aVand I hope you do too.
p287
aa(lp288
VThank you.
p289
aa(lp290
