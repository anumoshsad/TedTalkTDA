VIf you look deep into the night sky,
p4
aVyou see stars,
p5
aVand if you look further, you see more stars,
p6
aVand further, galaxies, and  further, more galaxies.
p7
aVBut if you keep looking further and further,
p8
aVeventually you see nothing for a long while,
p9
aVand then finally you see a faint, fading afterglow,
p10
aVand it's the afterglow of the Big Bang.
p11
aa(lp12
VNow, the Big Bang was an era in the early universe
p13
aVwhen everything we see in the night sky
p14
aVwas condensed into an incredibly small,
p15
aVincredibly hot, incredibly roiling mass,
p16
aVand from it sprung everything we see.
p17
aa(lp18
VNow, we've mapped that afterglow
p19
aVwith great precision,
p20
aVand when I say we, I mean people who aren't me.
p21
aVWe've mapped the afterglow
p22
aVwith spectacular precision,
p23
aVand one of the shocks about it
p24
aVis that it's almost completely uniform.
p25
aVFourteen billion light years that way
p26
aVand 14 billion light years that way,
p27
aVit's the same temperature.
p28
aVNow it's been 14 billion years
p29
aVsince that Big Bang,
p30
aVand so it's got faint and cold.
p31
aVIt's now 2.7 degrees.
p32
aVBut it's not exactly 2.7 degrees.
p33
aVIt's only 2.7 degrees to about
p34
aV10 parts in a million.
p35
aVOver here, it's a little hotter,
p36
aVand over there, it's a little cooler,
p37
aVand that's incredibly important to everyone in this room,
p38
aVbecause where it was a little hotter,
p39
aVthere was a little more stuff,
p40
aVand where there was a little more stuff,
p41
aVwe have galaxies and clusters of galaxies
p42
aVand superclusters
p43
aVand all the structure you see in the cosmos.
p44
aVAnd those small, little, inhomogeneities,
p45
aV20 parts in a million,
p46
aVthose were formed by quantum mechanical wiggles
p47
aVin that early universe that were stretched
p48
aVacross the size of the entire cosmos.
p49
aa(lp50
VThat is spectacular,
p51
aVand that's not what they found on Monday;
p52
aVwhat they found on Monday is cooler.
p53
aVSo here's what they found on Monday:
p54
aVImagine you take a bell,
p55
aVand you whack the bell with a hammer.
p56
aVWhat happens? It rings.
p57
aVBut if you wait, that ringing fades
p58
aVand fades and fades
p59
aVuntil you don't notice it anymore.
p60
aVNow, that early universe was incredibly dense,
p61
aVlike a metal, way denser,
p62
aVand if you hit it, it would ring,
p63
aVbut the thing ringing would be
p64
aVthe structure of space-time itself,
p65
aVand the hammer would be quantum mechanics.
p66
aVWhat they found on Monday
p67
aVwas evidence of the ringing
p68
aVof the space-time of the early universe,
p69
aVwhat we call gravitational waves
p70
aVfrom the fundamental era,
p71
aVand here's how they found it.
p72
aVThose waves have long since faded.
p73
aVIf you go for a walk,
p74
aVyou don't wiggle.
p75
aVThose gravitational waves in the structure of space
p76
aVare totally invisible for all practical purposes.
p77
aVBut early on, when the universe was making
p78
aVthat last afterglow,
p79
aVthe gravitational waves
p80
aVput little twists in the structure
p81
aVof the light that we see.
p82
aVSo by looking at the night sky deeper and deeper \u2014
p83
aVin fact, these guys spent three years on the South Pole
p84
aVlooking straight up through the coldest, clearest,
p85
aVcleanest air they possibly could find
p86
aVlooking deep into the night sky and studying
p87
aVthat glow and looking for the faint twists
p88
aVwhich are the symbol, the signal,
p89
aVof gravitational waves,
p90
aVthe ringing of the early universe.
p91
aVAnd on Monday, they announced
p92
aVthat they had found it.
p93
aa(lp94
VAnd the thing that's so spectacular about that to me
p95
aVis not just the ringing, though that is awesome.
p96
aVThe thing that's totally amazing,
p97
aVthe reason I'm on this stage, is because
p98
aVwhat that tells us is something deep about the early universe.
p99
aVIt tells us that we
p100
aVand everything we see around us
p101
aVare basically one large bubble \u2014
p102
aVand this is the idea of inflation\u2014
p103
aVone large bubble surrounded by something else.
p104
aVThis isn't conclusive evidence for inflation,
p105
aVbut anything that isn't inflation that explains this
p106
aVwill look the same.
p107
aVThis is a theory, an idea,
p108
aVthat has been around for a while,
p109
aVand we never thought we we'd really see it.
p110
aVFor good reasons, we thought we'd never see
p111
aVkiller evidence, and this is killer evidence.
p112
aa(lp113
VBut the really crazy idea
p114
aVis that our bubble is just one bubble
p115
aVin a much larger, roiling pot of universal stuff.
p116
aVWe're never going to see the stuff outside,
p117
aVbut by going to the South Pole and spending three years
p118
aVlooking at the detailed structure of the night sky,
p119
aVwe can figure out
p120
aVthat we're probably in a universe that looks kind of like that.
p121
aVAnd that amazes me.
