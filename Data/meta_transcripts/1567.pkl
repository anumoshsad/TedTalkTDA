VI want to talk to you today
p4
aVabout a difficult topic that is close to me,
p5
aVand closer than you might realize to you.
p6
aa(lp7
VI came to the UK 21 years ago, as an asylum-seeker.
p8
aVI was 21.
p9
aVI was forced to leave the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
p10
aVmy home, where I was a student activist.
p11
aVI would love my children to be able to meet my family in the Congo.
p12
aa(lp13
VBut I want to tell you what the Congo has got to do with you.
p14
aVBut first of all, I want you to do me a favor.
p15
aVCan you all please reach into your pockets and take out your mobile phone?
p16
aVFeel that familiar weight ...
p17
aVhow naturally your finger slides towards the buttons.
p18
aa(lp19
V(Laughter)
p20
aa(lp21
VCan you imagine your world without it?
p22
aVIt connects us to our loved ones,
p23
aVour family, friends and colleagues,
p24
aVat home and overseas.
p25
aVIt is a symbol of an interconnected world.
p26
aa(lp27
VBut what you hold in your hand leaves a bloody trail,
p28
aVand it all boils down to a mineral:
p29
aVtantalum, mined in the Congo as coltan.
p30
aVIt is an anticorrosive heat conductor.
p31
aVIt stores energy in our mobile phones, PlayStations and laptops.
p32
aVIt is used in aerospace and medical equipment as an alloy.
p33
aVIt is so powerful that we only need tiny amounts.
p34
aVIt would be great if the story ended there.
p35
aa(lp36
VUnfortunately, what you hold in your hand
p37
aVhas not only enabled incredible technological development
p38
aVand industrial expansion,
p39
aVbut it has also contributed to unimaginable human suffering.
p40
aa(lp41
VSince 1996,
p42
aVover five million people have died in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
p43
aVCountless women, men and children have been raped, tortured or enslaved.
p44
aVRape is used as a weapon of war,
p45
aVinstilling fear and depopulating whole areas.
p46
aVThe quest for extracting this mineral
p47
aVhas not only aided, but it has fueled
p48
aVthe ongoing war in the Congo.
p49
aa(lp50
VBut don't throw away your phones yet.
p51
aVThirty thousand children are enlisted
p52
aVand are made to fight in armed groups.
p53
aVThe Congo consistently scores dreadfully
p54
aVin global health and poverty rankings.
p55
aVBut remarkably,
p56
aVthe UN Environmental Programme has estimated the wealth of the country
p57
aVto be over 24 trillion dollars.
p58
aVThe state-regulated mining industry has collapsed,
p59
aVand control over mines has splintered.
p60
aVColtan is easily controlled by armed groups.
p61
aVOne well-known illicit trade route is that across the border to Rwanda,
p62
aVwhere Congolese tantalum is disguised as Rwandan.
p63
aa(lp64
VBut don't throw away your phones yet,
p65
aVbecause the incredible irony
p66
aVis that the technology that has placed such unsustainable,
p67
aVdevastating demands on the Congo
p68
aVis the same technology that has brought this situation to our attention.
p69
aVWe only know so much about the situation in the Congo and in the mines
p70
aVbecause of the kind of communication the mobile phone allows.
p71
aVAs with the Arab Spring,
p72
aVduring the recent elections in the Congo,
p73
aVvoters were able to send text messages of local polling stations
p74
aVto the headquarters in the capital, Kinshasa.
p75
aVAnd in the wake of the result,
p76
aVthe diaspora has joined with the Carter Center,
p77
aVthe Catholic Church and other observers,
p78
aVto draw attention to the undemocratic result.
p79
aa(lp80
VThe mobile phone has given people around the world
p81
aVan important tool towards gaining their political freedom.
p82
aVIt has truly revolutionized the way we communicate on the planet.
p83
aVIt has allowed momentous political change to take place.
p84
aVSo, we are faced with a paradox.
p85
aVThe mobile phone is an instrument of freedom
p86
aVand an instrument of oppression.
p87
aa(lp88
VTED has always celebrated what technology can do for us,
p89
aVtechnology in its finished form.
p90
aVIt is time to be asking questions about technology.
p91
aVWhere does it come from?
p92
aVWho makes it?
p93
aVAnd for what?
p94
aVHere, I am speaking directly to you,
p95
aVthe TED community,
p96
aVand to all those who might be watching on a screen,
p97
aVon your phone, across the world,
p98
aVin the Congo.
p99
aVAll the technology is in place for us to communicate,
p100
aVand all the technology is in place to communicate this.
p101
aa(lp102
VAt the moment,
p103
aVthere is no clear fair-trade solution.
p104
aVBut there has been a huge amount of progress.
p105
aVThe US has recently passed legislation
p106
aVto target bribery and misconduct in the Congo.
p107
aVRecent UK legislation could be used in the same way.
p108
aVIn February, Nokia unveiled its new policy on sourcing minerals in the Congo,
p109
aVand there is a petition to Apple to make a conflict-free iPhone.
p110
aVThere are campaigns spreading across university campuses
p111
aVto make their colleges conflict-free.
p112
aVBut we're not there yet.
p113
aVWe need to continue mounting pressure on phone companies
p114
aVto change their sourcing processes.
p115
aa(lp116
VWhen I first came to the UK, 21 years ago,
p117
aVI was homesick.
p118
aVI missed my family and the friends I left behind.
p119
aVCommunication was extremely difficult.
p120
aVSending and receiving letters took months \u2014
p121
aVif you were lucky.
p122
aVOften, they never arrived.
p123
aVEven if I could have afforded the phone bills home,
p124
aVlike most people in the Congo,
p125
aVmy parents did not own a phone line.
p126
aa(lp127
VToday, my two sons \u2014
p128
aVDavid and Daniel,
p129
aVcan talk to my parents and get to know them.
p130
aVWhy should we allow
p131
aVsuch a wonderful, brilliant and necessary product
p132
aVto be the cause of unnecessary suffering
p133
aVfor human beings?
p134
aa(lp135
VWe demand fair-trade food and fair-trade clothes.
p136
aVIt is time to demand fair-trade phones.
p137
aVThis is an idea worth spreading.
p138
aa(lp139
VThank you.
