VMy story is a little bit about war.
p4
aVIt's about disillusionment.
p5
aVIt's about death.
p6
aVAnd it's about rediscovering
p7
aVidealism
p8
aVin all of that wreckage.
p9
aVAnd perhaps also, there's a lesson
p10
aVabout how to deal with
p11
aVour screwed-up, fragmenting
p12
aVand dangerous world of the 21st century.
p13
aVI don't believe in straightforward narratives.
p14
aVI don't believe in a life or history
p15
aVwritten as decision "A" led to consequence "B"
p16
aVled to consequence "C" \u2014
p17
aVthese neat narratives that we're presented with,
p18
aVand that perhaps we encourage in each other.
p19
aVI believe in randomness,
p20
aVand one of the reasons I believe that
p21
aVis because me becoming a diplomat was random.
p22
aVI'm colorblind.
p23
aVI was born unable to see most colors.
p24
aVThis is why I wear gray and black most of the time,
p25
aVand I have to take my wife with me
p26
aVto chose clothes.
p27
aa(lp28
VAnd I'd always wanted to be a fighter pilot when I was a boy.
p29
aVI loved watching planes barrel over
p30
aVour holiday home in the countryside.
p31
aVAnd it was my boyhood dream to be a fighter pilot.
p32
aVAnd I did the tests in the Royal Air Force to become a pilot,
p33
aVand sure enough, I failed.
p34
aVI couldn't see all the blinking different lights,
p35
aVand I can't distinguish color.
p36
aVSo I had to choose another career,
p37
aVand this was in fact relatively easy for me,
p38
aVbecause I had an abiding passion all the way through my childhood,
p39
aVwhich was international relations.
p40
aVAs a child,
p41
aVI read the newspaper thoroughly.
p42
aVI was fascinated by the Cold War,
p43
aVby the INF negotiations
p44
aVover intermediate-range nuclear missiles,
p45
aVthe proxy war between the Soviet Union and the U.S.
p46
aVin Angola or Afghanistan.
p47
aVThese things really interested me.
p48
aVAnd so I decided quite at an early age
p49
aVI wanted to be a diplomat.
p50
aVAnd I, one day, I announced this to my parents \u2014
p51
aVand my father denies this story to this day \u2014
p52
aVI said, "Daddy, I want to be a diplomat."
p53
aVAnd he turned to me, and he said,
p54
aV"Carne, you have to be very clever to be a diplomat."
p55
aV(Laughter)
p56
aVAnd my ambition was sealed.
p57
aa(lp58
VIn 1989,
p59
aVI entered the British Foreign Service.
p60
aVThat year, 5,000 people applied to become a diplomat,
p61
aVand 20 of us succeeded.
p62
aVAnd as those numbers suggest,
p63
aVI was inducted into an elite
p64
aVand fascinating and exhilarating world.
p65
aVBeing a diplomat, then and now,
p66
aVis an incredible job, and I loved every minute of it \u2014
p67
aVI enjoyed the status of it.
p68
aVI bought myself a nice suit and wore leather-soled shoes
p69
aVand reveled in
p70
aVthis amazing access I had to world events.
p71
aVI traveled to the Gaza Strip.
p72
aVI headed the Middle East Peace Process section
p73
aVin the British Foreign Ministry.
p74
aVI became a speechwriter
p75
aVfor the British Foreign Secretary.
p76
aVI met Yasser Arafat.
p77
aVI negotiated
p78
aVwith Saddam's diplomats at the U.N.
p79
aVLater, I traveled to Kabul
p80
aVand served in Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban.
p81
aVAnd I would travel
p82
aVin a C-130 transport
p83
aVand go and visit warlords
p84
aVin mountain hideaways
p85
aVand negotiate with them
p86
aVabout how we were going to eradicate Al Qaeda from Afghanistan,
p87
aVsurrounded by my Special Forces escort,
p88
aVwho, themselves, had to have an escort of a platoon of Royal Marines,
p89
aVbecause it was so dangerous.
p90
aVAnd that was exciting \u2014 that was fun.
p91
aVIt was really interesting.
p92
aVAnd it's a great cadre of people,
p93
aVincredibly close-knit community of people.
p94
aa(lp95
VAnd the pinnacle of my career, as it turned out,
p96
aVwas when I was posted to New York.
p97
aVI'd already served in Germany, Norway,
p98
aVvarious other places,
p99
aVbut I was posted to New York
p100
aVto serve on the U.N. Security Council for the British delegation.
p101
aVAnd my responsibility was the Middle East,
p102
aVwhich was my specialty.
p103
aVAnd there, I dealt with things
p104
aVlike the Middle East peace process,
p105
aVthe Lockerbie issue \u2014
p106
aVwe can talk about that later, if you wish \u2014
p107
aVbut above all, my responsibility was Iraq
p108
aVand its weapons of mass destruction
p109
aVand the sanctions we placed on Iraq
p110
aVto oblige it to disarm itself of these weapons.
p111
aVI was the chief British negotiator
p112
aVon the subject,
p113
aVand I was steeped in the issue.
p114
aVAnd anyway,
p115
aVmy tour \u2014 it was kind of a very exciting time.
p116
aVI mean it was very dramatic diplomacy.
p117
aVWe went through several wars
p118
aVduring my time in New York.
p119
aVI negotiated for my country
p120
aVthe resolution in the Security Council
p121
aVof the 12th of September 2001
p122
aVcondemning the attacks of the day before,
p123
aVwhich were, of course, deeply present to us
p124
aVactually living in New York at the time.
p125
aVSo it was kind of the best of time, worst of times
p126
aVkind of experience.
p127
aVI lived the high-life.
p128
aVAlthough I worked very long hours,
p129
aVI lived in a penthouse in Union Square.
p130
aVI was a single British diplomat in New York City;
p131
aVyou can imagine what that might have meant.
p132
aV(Laughter)
p133
aVI had a good time.
p134
aa(lp135
VBut in 2002,
p136
aVwhen my tour came to an end,
p137
aVI decided I wasn't going to go back
p138
aVto the job that was waiting for me in London.
p139
aVI decided to take a sabbatical,
p140
aVin fact, at the New School, Bruce.
p141
aVIn some inchoate, inarticulate way
p142
aVI realized that there was something wrong
p143
aVwith my work, with me.
p144
aVI was exhausted,
p145
aVand I was also disillusioned
p146
aVin a way I couldn't quite put my finger on.
p147
aVAnd I decided to take some time out from work.
p148
aVThe Foreign Office was very generous.
p149
aVYou could take these special unpaid leave, as they called them,
p150
aVand yet remain part of the diplomatic service, but not actually do any work.
p151
aVIt was nice.
p152
aVAnd eventually, I decided
p153
aVto take a secondment to join the U.N. in Kosovo,
p154
aVwhich was then under U.N. administration.
p155
aa(lp156
VAnd two things happened in Kosovo,
p157
aVwhich kind of, again,
p158
aVshows the randomness of life,
p159
aVbecause these things turned out to be
p160
aVtwo of the pivots of my life
p161
aVand helped to deliver me to the next stage.
p162
aVBut they were random things.
p163
aVOne was that, in the summer of 2004,
p164
aVthe British government, somewhat reluctantly,
p165
aVdecided to have an official inquiry
p166
aVinto the use of intelligence on WMD
p167
aVin the run up to the Iraq War,
p168
aVa very limited subject.
p169
aVAnd I testified to that inquiry in secret.
p170
aVI had been steeped in the intelligence on Iraq
p171
aVand its WMD,
p172
aVand my testimony to the inquiry said three things:
p173
aVthat the government exaggerated the intelligence,
p174
aVwhich was very clear in all the years I'd read it.
p175
aVAnd indeed, our own internal assessment was very clear
p176
aVthat Iraq's WMD
p177
aVdid not pose a threat to its neighbors, let alone to us.
p178
aVSecondly, the government had ignored all available alternatives to war,
p179
aVwhich in some ways
p180
aVwas a more discreditable thing still.
p181
aVThe third reason, I won't go into.
p182
aVBut anyway, I gave that testimony,
p183
aVand that presented me with a crisis.
p184
aVWhat was I going to do?
p185
aVThis testimony was deeply critical of my colleagues,
p186
aVof my ministers, who had, in my view
p187
aVhad perpetrated a war on a falsehood.
p188
aa(lp189
VAnd so I was in crisis.
p190
aVAnd this wasn't a pretty thing.
p191
aVI moaned about it, I hesitated,
p192
aVI went on and on and on to my long-suffering wife,
p193
aVand eventually I decided to resign from the British Foreign Service.
p194
aVI felt \u2014 there's a scene in the Al Pacino movie "The Insider," which you may know,
p195
aVwhere he goes back to CBS
p196
aVafter they've let him down over the tobacco guy,
p197
aVand he goes, "You know, I just can't do this anymore. Something's broken."
p198
aVAnd it was like that for me. I love that movie.
p199
aVI felt just something's broken.
p200
aVI can't actually sit with my foreign minister
p201
aVor my prime minister again with a smile on my face
p202
aVand do what I used to do gladly for them.
p203
aVSo took a running leap
p204
aVand jumped over the edge of a cliff.
p205
aa(lp206
VAnd it was a very, very uncomfortable, unpleasant feeling.
p207
aVAnd I started to fall.
p208
aVAnd today, that fall hasn't stopped;
p209
aVI'm still falling.
p210
aVBut, in a way, I've got used to the sensation of it.
p211
aVAnd in a way, I kind of like
p212
aVthe sensation of it a lot better
p213
aVthan I like actually standing on top of the cliff,
p214
aVwondering what to do.
p215
aVA second thing happened in Kosovo,
p216
aVwhich kind of \u2014 I need a quick gulp of water, forgive me.
p217
aVA second thing happened in Kosovo,
p218
aVwhich kind of delivered the answer,
p219
aVwhich I couldn't really answer,
p220
aVwhich is, "What do I do with my life?"
p221
aVI love diplomacy \u2014
p222
aVI have no career \u2014
p223
aVI expected my entire life to be a diplomat, to be serving my country.
p224
aVI wanted to be an ambassador,
p225
aVand my mentors, my heroes,
p226
aVpeople who got to the top of my profession,
p227
aVand here I was throwing it all away.
p228
aVA lot of my friends were still in it.
p229
aVMy pension was in it.
p230
aVAnd I gave it up.
p231
aVAnd what was I going to do?
p232
aa(lp233
VAnd that year, in Kosovo,
p234
aVthis terrible, terrible thing happened, which I saw.
p235
aVIn March 2004, there were terrible riots
p236
aVall over the province \u2014 as it then was \u2014 of Kosovo.
p237
aV18 people were killed.
p238
aVIt was anarchy.
p239
aVAnd it's a very horrible thing to see anarchy,
p240
aVto know that the police and the military \u2014
p241
aVthere were lots of military troops there \u2014
p242
aVactually can't stop that rampaging mob
p243
aVwho's coming down the street.
p244
aVAnd the only way that rampaging mob coming down the street will stop
p245
aVis when they decide to stop
p246
aVand when they've had enough burning and killing.
p247
aVAnd that is not a very nice feeling to see, and I saw it.
p248
aVAnd I went through it. I went through those mobs.
p249
aVAnd with my Albanian friends, we tried to stop it, but we failed.
p250
aVAnd that riot taught me something,
p251
aVwhich isn't immediately obvious and it's kind of a complicated story.
p252
aa(lp253
VBut one of the reasons that riot took place \u2014
p254
aVthose riots, which went on for several days, took place \u2014
p255
aVwas because the Kosovo people
p256
aVwere disenfranchised from their own future.
p257
aVThere were diplomatic negotiations about the future of Kosovo
p258
aVgoing on then,
p259
aVand the Kosovo government, let alone the Kosovo people,
p260
aVwere not actually
p261
aVparticipating in those talks.
p262
aVThere was this whole fancy diplomatic system,
p263
aVthis negotiation process about the future of Kosovo,
p264
aVand the Kosovars weren't part of it.
p265
aVAnd funnily enough, they were frustrated about that.
p266
aVThose riots were part of the manifestation of that frustration.
p267
aVIt wasn't the only reason,
p268
aVand life is not simple, one reason narratives.
p269
aVIt was a complicated thing,
p270
aVand I'm not pretending it was more simple than it was.
p271
aVBut that was one of the reasons.
p272
aa(lp273
VAnd that kind of gave me the inspiration \u2014
p274
aVor rather to be precise,
p275
aVit gave my wife the inspiration.
p276
aVShe said, "Why don't you advise the Kosovars?
p277
aVWhy don't you advise their government on their diplomacy?"
p278
aVAnd the Kosovars were not allowed a diplomatic service.
p279
aVThey were not allowed diplomats.
p280
aVThey were not allowed a foreign office
p281
aVto help them deal with this immensely complicated process,
p282
aVwhich became known as the Final Status Process of Kosovo.
p283
aVAnd so that was the idea.
p284
aVThat was the origin of the thing that became Independent Diplomat,
p285
aVthe world's first diplomatic advisory group
p286
aVand a non-profit to boot.
p287
aVAnd it began when I flew back from London
p288
aVafter my time at the U.N. in Kosovo.
p289
aVI flew back and had dinner with the Kosovo prime minister and said to him,
p290
aV"Look, I'm proposing that I come and advise you on the diplomacy.
p291
aVI know this stuff. It's what I do. Why don't I come and help you?"
p292
aVAnd he raised his glass of raki to me and said,
p293
aV"Yes, Carne. Come."
p294
aa(lp295
VAnd I came to Kosovo
p296
aVand advised the Kosovo government.
p297
aVIndependent Diplomat ended up advising three successive Kosovo prime ministers
p298
aVand the multi-party negotiation team of Kosovo.
p299
aVAnd Kosovo became independent.
p300
aVIndependent Diplomat is now established
p301
aVin five diplomatic centers around the world,
p302
aVand we're advising seven or eight
p303
aVdifferent countries, or political groups,
p304
aVdepending on how you wish to define them \u2014
p305
aVand I'm not big on definitions.
p306
aVWe're advising the Northern Cypriots on how to reunify their island.
p307
aVWe're advising the Burmese opposition,
p308
aVthe government of Southern Sudan,
p309
aVwhich \u2014 you heard it here first \u2014
p310
aVis going to be a new country within the next few years.
p311
aVWe're advising the Polisario Front of the Western Sahara,
p312
aVwho are fighting to get their country back
p313
aVfrom Moroccan occupation
p314
aVafter 34 years of dispossession.
p315
aVWe're advising various island states in the climate change negotiations,
p316
aVwhich is suppose to culminate
p317
aVin Copenhagen.
p318
aa(lp319
VThere's a bit of randomness here too
p320
aVbecause, when I was beginning Independent Diplomat,
p321
aVI went to a party in the House of Lords,
p322
aVwhich is a ridiculous place,
p323
aVbut I was holding my drink like this, and I bumped into
p324
aVthis guy who was standing behind me.
p325
aVAnd we started talking, and he said \u2014
p326
aVI told him what I was doing,
p327
aVand I told him rather grandly
p328
aVI was going to establish Independent Diplomat in New York.
p329
aVAt that time there was just me \u2014
p330
aVand me and my wife were moving back to New York.
p331
aVAnd he said, "Why don't you see my colleagues in New York?"
p332
aVAnd it turned out
p333
aVhe worked for an innovation company called ?What If!,
p334
aVwhich some of you have probably heard of.
p335
aVAnd one thing led to another,
p336
aVand I ended up having a desk
p337
aVin ?What If! in New York,
p338
aVwhen I started Independent Diplomat.
p339
aVAnd watching ?What If!
p340
aVdevelop new flavors of chewing gum for Wrigley
p341
aVor new flavors for Coke
p342
aVactually helped me innovate
p343
aVnew strategies for the Kosovars
p344
aVand for the Saharawis of the Western Sahara.
p345
aVAnd I began to realize that there are different ways of doing diplomacy \u2014
p346
aVthat diplomacy, like business,
p347
aVis a business of solving problems,
p348
aVand yet the word innovation doesn't exist in diplomacy;
p349
aVit's all zero sum games and realpolitik
p350
aVand ancient institutions that have been there for generations
p351
aVand do things the same way they've always done things.
p352
aa(lp353
VAnd Independent Diplomat, today,
p354
aVtries to incorporate some of the things I learned at ?What If!.
p355
aVWe all sit in one office and shout at each other across the office.
p356
aVWe all work on little laptops and try to move desks to change the way we think.
p357
aVAnd we use naive experts
p358
aVwho may know nothing about the countries we're dealing with,
p359
aVbut may know something about something else
p360
aVto try to inject new thinking
p361
aVinto the problems
p362
aVthat we try to address for our clients.
p363
aVIt's not easy, because our clients, by definition,
p364
aVare having a difficult time, diplomatically.
p365
aa(lp366
VThere are, I don't know,
p367
aVsome lessons from all of this,
p368
aVpersonal and political \u2014
p369
aVand in a way, they're the same thing.
p370
aVThe personal one
p371
aVis falling off a cliff
p372
aVis actually a good thing, and I recommend it.
p373
aVAnd it's a good thing to do at least once in your life
p374
aVjust to tear everything up and jump.
p375
aVThe second thing is a bigger lesson about the world today.
p376
aVIndependent Diplomat is part of a trend
p377
aVwhich is emerging and evident across the world,
p378
aVwhich is that the world is fragmenting.
p379
aVStates mean less than they used to,
p380
aVand the power of the state is declining.
p381
aVThat means the power of others things is rising.
p382
aVThose other things are called non-state actors.
p383
aVThey may be corporations,
p384
aVthey may be mafiosi, they may be nice NGOs,
p385
aVthey may anything,
p386
aVany number of things.
p387
aVWe are living in a more complicated and fragmented world.
p388
aVIf governments are less able
p389
aVto affect the problems
p390
aVthat affect us in the world,
p391
aVthen that means, who is left to deal with them,
p392
aVwho has to take greater responsibility to deal with them?
p393
aVUs.
p394
aVIf they can't do it, who's left to deal with it?
p395
aVWe have no choice but to embrace that reality.
p396
aa(lp397
VWhat this means is
p398
aVit's no longer good enough
p399
aVto say that international relations, or global affairs,
p400
aVor chaos in Somalia,
p401
aVor what's going on in Burma is none of your business,
p402
aVand that you can leave it to governments to get on with.
p403
aVI can connect any one of you
p404
aVby six degrees of separation
p405
aVto the Al-Shabaab militia in Somalia.
p406
aVAsk me how later, particularly if you eat fish, interestingly enough,
p407
aVbut that connection is there.
p408
aVWe are all intimately connected.
p409
aVAnd this isn't just Tom Friedman,
p410
aVit's actually provable in case after case after case.
p411
aVWhat that means is, instead of asking your politicians to do things,
p412
aVyou have to look to yourself to do things.
p413
aVAnd Independent Diplomat is a kind of example of this
p414
aVin a sort of loose way.
p415
aa(lp416
VThere aren't neat examples, but one example is this:
p417
aVthe way the world is changing
p418
aVis embodied in what's going on at the place I used to work \u2014
p419
aVthe U.N. Security Council.
p420
aVThe U.N. was established in 1945.
p421
aVIts charter is basically designed
p422
aVto stop conflicts between states \u2014
p423
aVinterstate conflict.
p424
aVToday, 80 percent of the agenda
p425
aVof the U.N. Security Council
p426
aVis about conflicts within states,
p427
aVinvolving non-state parties \u2014
p428
aVguerillas, separatists,
p429
aVterrorists, if you want to call them that,
p430
aVpeople who are not normal governments, who are not normal states.
p431
aVThat is the state of the world today.
p432
aVWhen I realized this,
p433
aVand when I look back on my time at the Security Council
p434
aVand what happened with the Kosovars,
p435
aVand I realize that often
p436
aVthe people who were most directly affected
p437
aVby what we were doing in the Security Council
p438
aVweren't actually there, weren't actually invited
p439
aVto give their views to the Security Council,
p440
aVI thought, this is wrong.
p441
aVSomething's got to be done about this.
p442
aa(lp443
VSo I started off in a traditional mode.
p444
aVMe and my colleagues at Independent Diplomat
p445
aVwent around the U.N. Security Council.
p446
aVWe went around 70 U.N. member states \u2014
p447
aVthe Kazaks, the Ethiopians, the Israelis \u2014
p448
aVyou name them, we went to see them \u2014
p449
aVthe secretary general, all of them,
p450
aVand said, "This is all wrong.
p451
aVThis is terrible that you don't consult these people who are actually affected.
p452
aVYou've got to institutionalize a system
p453
aVwhere you actually invite the Kosovars
p454
aVto come and tell you what they think.
p455
aVThis will allow you to tell me \u2014 you can tell them what you think.
p456
aVIt'll be great. You can have an exchange.
p457
aVYou can actually incorporate these people's views into your decisions,
p458
aVwhich means your decisions will be more effective and durable."
p459
aVSuper-logical, you would think.
p460
aVI mean, incredibly logical. So obvious, anybody could get it.
p461
aVAnd of course, everybody got it. Everybody went, "Yes, of course, you're absolutely right.
p462
aVCome back to us
p463
aVin maybe six months."
p464
aVAnd of course, nothing happened \u2014 nobody did anything.
p465
aVThe Security Council does its business
p466
aVin exactly the same way today
p467
aVthat it did X number of years ago,
p468
aVwhen I was there 10 years ago.
p469
aa(lp470
VSo we looked at that observation
p471
aVof basically failure
p472
aVand thought, what can we do about it.
p473
aVAnd I thought, I'm buggered
p474
aVif I'm going to spend the rest of my life
p475
aVlobbying for these crummy governments
p476
aVto do what needs to be done.
p477
aVSo what we're going to do
p478
aVis we're actually going to set up these meetings ourselves.
p479
aVSo now, Independent Diplomat
p480
aVis in the process of setting up meetings
p481
aVbetween the U.N. Security Council
p482
aVand the parties to the disputes
p483
aVthat are on the agenda of the Security Council.
p484
aVSo we will be bringing
p485
aVDarfuri rebel groups,
p486
aVthe Northern Cypriots and the Southern Cypriots,
p487
aVrebels from Aceh,
p488
aVand awful long laundry list
p489
aVof chaotic conflicts around the world.
p490
aVAnd we will be trying to bring the parties to New York
p491
aVto sit down in a quiet room
p492
aVin a private setting with no press
p493
aVand actually explain what they want
p494
aVto the members of the U. N. Security Council,
p495
aVand for the members of the U.N. Security Council
p496
aVto explain to them what they want.
p497
aVSo there's actually a conversation,
p498
aVwhich has never before happened.
p499
aVAnd of course, describing all this,
p500
aVany of you who know politics will think this is incredibly difficult,
p501
aVand I entirely agree with you.
p502
aVThe chances of failure are very high,
p503
aVbut it certainly won't happen
p504
aVif we don't try to make it happen.
p505
aa(lp506
VAnd my politics has changed fundamentally
p507
aVfrom when I was a diplomat to what I am today,
p508
aVand I think that outputs is what matters, not process,
p509
aVnot technology, frankly, so much either.
p510
aVPreach technology
p511
aVto all the Twittering members of all the Iranian demonstrations
p512
aVwho are now in political prison in Tehran,
p513
aVwhere Ahmadinejad remains in power.
p514
aVTechnology has not delivered political change in Iran.
p515
aVYou've got to look at the outputs, and you got to say to yourself,
p516
aV"What can I do to produce that particular output?"
p517
aVThat is the politics of the 21st century,
p518
aVand in a way, Independent Diplomat
p519
aVembodies that fragmentation, that change,
p520
aVthat is happening to all of us.
p521
aa(lp522
VThat's my story. Thanks.
