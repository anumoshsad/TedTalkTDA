VEverything is interconnected.
p4
aVAs a Shinnecock Indian, I was raised to know this.
p5
aVWe are a small fishing tribe
p6
aVsituated on the southeastern tip of Long Island
p7
aVnear the town of Southampton in New York.

aa(lp9
VWhen I was a little girl,
p10
aVmy grandfather took me to sit outside in the sun on a hot summer day.
p11
aVThere were no clouds in the sky.
p12
aVAnd after a while I began to perspire.
p13
aVAnd he pointed up to the sky, and he said,
p14
aV"Look, do you see that?
p15
aVThat's part of you up there.
p16
aVThat's your water that helps to make the cloud
p17
aVthat becomes the rain that feeds the plants
p18
aVthat feeds the animals."
p19
aa(lp20
VIn my continued exploration of subjects in nature
p21
aVthat have the ability to illustrate the interconnection of all life,
p22
aVI started storm chasing in 2008
p23
aVafter my daughter said, "Mom, you should do that."
p24
aa(lp25
VAnd so three days later, driving very fast,
p26
aVI found myself stalking a single type of giant cloud called the super cell,
p27
aVcapable of producing grapefruit-size hail
p28
aVand spectacular tornadoes,
p29
aValthough only two percent actually do.
p30
aVThese clouds can grow so big, up to 50 miles wide
p31
aVand reach up to 65,000 feet into the atmosphere.
p32
aVThey can grow so big, blocking all daylight,
p33
aVmaking it very dark and ominous standing under them.
p34
aa(lp35
VStorm chasing is a very tactile experience.
p36
aVThere's a warm, moist wind blowing at your back
p37
aVand the smell of the earth, the wheat, the grass, the charged particles.
p38
aVAnd then there are the colors in the clouds
p39
aVof hail forming, the greens and the turquoise blues.
p40
aVI've learned to respect the lightning.
p41
aVMy hair used to be straight.

V(Laughter)
p44
aa(lp45
VI'm just kidding.

aa(lp49
VWhat really excites me about these storms
p50
aVis their movement, the way they swirl and spin and undulate,
p51
aVwith their lava lamp-like mammatus clouds.
p52
aVThey become lovely monsters.
p53
aa(lp54
VWhen I'm photographing them,
p55
aVI cannot help but remember my grandfather's lesson.
p56
aVAs I stand under them,
p57
aVI see not just a cloud,
p58
aVbut understand that what I have the privilege to witness
p59
aVis the same forces, the same process in a small-scale version
p60
aVthat helped to create our galaxy, our solar system, our sun
p61
aVand even this very planet.
p62
aa(lp63
VAll my relations. Thank you.
