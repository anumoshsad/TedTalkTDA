VTalking about empowerment is odd,
p4
aVbecause when we talk about empowerment,
p5
aVwhat affects us most are the stories.
p6
aVSo I want to begin with an everyday story.
p7
aVWhat is it really like to be a young woman in India?
p8
aa(lp9
VNow, I've spent the last 27 years of my life
p10
aVin India, lived in three small towns,
p11
aVtwo major cities,
p12
aVand I've had several experiences.
p13
aVWhen I was seven,
p14
aVa private tutor who used to come home
p15
aVto teach me mathematics molested me.
p16
aVHe would put his hand up my skirt.
p17
aVHe put his hand up my skirt and told me
p18
aVhe knew how to make me feel good.
p19
aVAt 17, a boy from my high school
p20
aVcirculated an email
p21
aVdetailing all the sexually aggressive things
p22
aVhe could do to me
p23
aVbecause I didn't pay attention to him.
p24
aVAt 19, I helped a friend
p25
aVwhose parents had forcefully married her to an older man
p26
aVescape an abusive marriage.
p27
aVAt 21, when my friend and I were walking
p28
aVdown the road one afternoon,
p29
aVa man pulled down his pants
p30
aVand masturbated in front of us.
p31
aVWe called people for help, and nobody came.
p32
aVAt 25, when I was walking home one evening,
p33
aVtwo men on a motorcycle attacked me.
p34
aVI spent two nights in the hospital
p35
aVrecovering from trauma and injuries.
p36
aa(lp37
VSo throughout my life, I've seen women \u2014
p38
aVfamily, friends, colleagues \u2014
p39
aVlive through these experiences,
p40
aVand they seldom talk about it.
p41
aVSo in simple words, life in India is not easy.
p42
aVBut today I'm not going to talk to you about this fear.
p43
aVI'm going to talk to you about an interesting path
p44
aVof learning that this fear took me on.
p45
aa(lp46
VSo, what happened one night in December 2012
p47
aVchanged my life.
p48
aVSo a young girl, a 23-year-old student,
p49
aVboarded a bus in Delhi with her male friend.
p50
aVThere were six men on the bus, young men
p51
aVwho you might encounter every day in India,
p52
aVand the chilling account of what followed
p53
aVwas played over and over again
p54
aVin the Indian and international media.
p55
aVThis girl was raped repeatedly,
p56
aVforcefully penetrated with a blunt rod,
p57
aVbeaten, bitten, and left to die.
p58
aVHer friend was gagged, attacked,
p59
aVand knocked unconscious.
p60
aVShe died on the 29th of December.
p61
aVAnd at a time when most of us here
p62
aVwere preparing to welcome the new year,
p63
aVIndia plunged into darkness.
p64
aVFor the first time in our history,
p65
aVmen and women in Indian cities
p66
aVwoke up to the horrific truth
p67
aVabout the true state of women in the country.
p68
aVNow, like many other young women,
p69
aVI was absolutely terrified.
p70
aVI couldn't believe that something like this
p71
aVcould happen in a national capital.
p72
aVI was angry and I was frustrated,
p73
aVbut most of all, I felt utterly, completely helpless.
p74
aVBut really, what do you do, right?
p75
aVSome write blogs, some ignore it,
p76
aVsome join protests.
p77
aVI did all of it. In fact, that was what everyone was doing
p78
aVtwo years ago.
p79
aVSo the media was filled with stories about
p80
aVall the horrific deeds
p81
aVthat Indian men are capable of.
p82
aVThey were compared to animals,
p83
aVsexually repressed beasts.
p84
aVIn fact, so alien and unthinkable was this event
p85
aVin an Indian mind
p86
aVthat the response from the Indian media,
p87
aVpublic and politicians proved one point:
p88
aVNo one knew what to do.
p89
aVAnd no one wanted to be responsible for it.
p90
aVIn fact, these were a few insensitive comments
p91
aVwhich were made in the media
p92
aVby prominent people
p93
aVin response to sexual violence against women in general.
p94
aVSo the first one is made by a member of parliament,
p95
aVthe second one is made by a spiritual leader,
p96
aVand the third one was actually the defendants' lawyer
p97
aVwhen the girl was fighting for her life
p98
aVand she passed away.
p99
aa(lp100
VNow, as a woman watching this day after day,
p101
aVI was tired.
p102
aVSo as a writer and gender activist,
p103
aVI have written extensively on women,
p104
aVbut this time, I realized it was different,
p105
aVbecause a part of me realized
p106
aVI was a part of that young woman too,
p107
aVand I decided I wanted to change this.
p108
aVSo I did something spontaneous, hasty.
p109
aVI logged on to a citizen journalism platform
p110
aVcalled iReport,
p111
aVand I recorded a video talking about
p112
aVwhat the scene was like in Bangalore.
p113
aVI talked about how I felt,
p114
aVI talked about the ground realities,
p115
aVand I talked about the frustrations of living in India.
p116
aVIn a few hours, the blog was shared widely,
p117
aVand comments and thoughts poured in
p118
aVfrom across the world.
p119
aVIn that moment, a few things occurred to me.
p120
aVOne, technology was always at hand
p121
aVfor many young women like me.
p122
aVTwo, like me, most young women
p123
aVhardly use it to express their views.
p124
aVThree, I realized for the first time
p125
aVthat my voice mattered.
p126
aa(lp127
VSo in the months that followed,
p128
aVI covered a trail of events in Bangalore
p129
aVwhich had no space in the mainstream news.
p130
aVIn Cubbon Park, which is a big park in Bangalore,
p131
aVI gathered with over 100 others
p132
aVwhen groups of young men came forward
p133
aVto wear skirts to prove that clothing
p134
aVdoes not invite rape.
p135
aVWhen I reported about these events,
p136
aVI felt I had charge, I felt like I had a channel
p137
aVto release all the emotions I had inside me.
p138
aVI attended the town hall march
p139
aVwhen students held up signs saying
p140
aV"Kill them, hang them."
p141
aV"You wouldn't do this to your mothers or sisters."
p142
aVI went to a candlelight vigil
p143
aVwhere citizens gathered together
p144
aVto talk about the issue of sexual violence openly,
p145
aVand I recorded a lot of blogs
p146
aVin response to how worrying the situation was
p147
aVin India at that point.
p148
aV["I am born with sisters and cousin who now live in cities and abroad but they never talk to me or complain about their daily difficulties like you say"]
p149
aa(lp150
VNow, the reactions confused me.
p151
aVWhile supportive comments poured in from across the world,
p152
aVas did vicious ones.
p153
aVSo some called me a hypocrite.
p154
aVSome called me a victim, a rape apologist.
p155
aVSome even said I had a political motive.
p156
aVBut this one comment kind of describes
p157
aVwhat we are discussing here today.
p158
aa(lp159
VBut I was soon to learn that this was not all.
p160
aVAs empowered as I felt
p161
aVwith the new liberty that this
p162
aVcitizen journalism channel gave me,
p163
aVI found myself in an unfamiliar situation.
p164
aVSo sometime last August, I logged onto Facebook
p165
aVand I was looking through my news feed,
p166
aVand I noticed there was a link
p167
aVthat was being shared by my friends.
p168
aVI clicked on the link; it led me back
p169
aVto a report uploaded by an American girl
p170
aVcalled Michaela Cross.
p171
aVThe report was titled,
p172
aV"India: The story you never wanted to hear."
p173
aVAnd in this report, she recounted her firsthand
p174
aVaccount of facing sexual harassment in India.
p175
aVShe wrote, "There is no way to prepare for the eyes,
p176
aVthe eyes that every day stared
p177
aVwith such entitlement at my body,
p178
aVwith no change of expression
p179
aVwhether I met their gaze or not.
p180
aVWalking to the fruit seller's or the tailor's,
p181
aVI got stares so sharp
p182
aVthat they sliced away bits of me piece by piece."
p183
aVShe called India a traveler's heaven and a woman's hell.
p184
aVShe said she was stalked, groped,
p185
aVand masturbated at.
p186
aa(lp187
VNow, late that evening, the report went viral.
p188
aVIt was on news channels across the world.
p189
aVEveryone was discussing it.
p190
aVIt had over a million views,
p191
aVa thousand comments and shares,
p192
aVand I found myself witnessing
p193
aVa very similar thing.
p194
aVThe media was caught in this vicious cycle
p195
aVof opinion and outburst
p196
aVand no outcome whatsoever.
p197
aVSo that night, as I sat wondering
p198
aVhow I should respond,
p199
aVI found myself filled with doubt.
p200
aVYou see, as a writer, I approached this issue
p201
aVas an observer,
p202
aVas an Indian, I felt embarrassment and disbelief,
p203
aVand as an activist, I looked at it as a defender of rights,
p204
aVbut as a citizen journalist,
p205
aVI suddenly felt very vulnerable.
p206
aVI mean, here she was, a young woman
p207
aVwho was using a channel to talk about
p208
aVher experience just as I was,
p209
aVand yet I felt unsettled.
p210
aVYou see, no one ever tells you
p211
aVthat true empowerment comes from giving yourself
p212
aVthe permission to think and act.
p213
aVEmpowerment is often made to sound as if
p214
aVit's an ideal, it's a wonderful outcome.
p215
aVWhen we talk about empowerment, we often
p216
aVtalk about giving people access to materials,
p217
aVgiving them access to tools.
p218
aVBut the thing is, empowerment is an emotion.
p219
aVIt's a feeling.
p220
aVThe first step to empowerment
p221
aVis to give yourself the authority,
p222
aVthe key to independent will,
p223
aVand for women everywhere,
p224
aVno matter who we are or where we come from,
p225
aVthat is the most difficult step.
p226
aVWe fear the sound of our own voice,
p227
aVfor it means admission, but it is this that gives us
p228
aVthe power to change our environment.
p229
aVNow in this situation where I was faced
p230
aVwith so many different kinds of realities,
p231
aVI was unsure how to judge,
p232
aVbecause I didn't know what it would mean for me.
p233
aVI feared to judge because I didn't know what it would be
p234
aVif I didn't support the same view as this girl.
p235
aVI didn't know what it would mean for me
p236
aVif I was challenging someone else's truth.
p237
aVBut yet, it was simple.
p238
aVI had to make a decision:
p239
aVShould I speak up or should I stay quiet?
p240
aVSo after a lot of thought,
p241
aVI recorded a video blog in response,
p242
aVand I told Michaela, well,
p243
aVthere are different sides to India,
p244
aVand I also tried to explain
p245
aVthat things would be okay
p246
aVand I expressed my regret for what she had faced.
p247
aVAnd a few days later, I was invited to talk
p248
aVon air with her,
p249
aVand for the first time, I reached out to this girl
p250
aVwho I had never met, who was so far away,
p251
aVbut yet I felt so close to.
p252
aa(lp253
VSince this report came to light,
p254
aVmore young people than ever
p255
aVwere discussing sexual harassment on the campus,
p256
aVand the university that Michaela belonged to
p257
aVgave her the assistance she needed.
p258
aVThe university even took measures
p259
aVto train its students to equip them
p260
aVwith the skills that they need
p261
aVto confront challenges such as harassment,
p262
aVand for the first the time, I felt I wasn't alone.
p263
aVYou see, if there's anything that I've learned
p264
aVas an active citizen journalist
p265
aVover the past few years,
p266
aVit is our dire lack as a society to actively find
p267
aVavenues where our voices can be heard.
p268
aVWe don't realize that when we are standing up,
p269
aVwe are not just standing up as individuals,
p270
aVwe are standing up for our communities,
p271
aVour friends, our peers.
p272
aVMost of us say that women are denied their rights,
p273
aVbut the truth is, oftentimes,
p274
aVwomen deny themselves these rights.
p275
aVIn a recent survey in India,
p276
aV95 percent of the women who work in I.T.,
p277
aVaviation, hospitality and call centers,
p278
aVsaid they didn't feel safe returning home alone
p279
aVafter work in the late hours or in the evening.
p280
aVIn Bangalore, where I come from,
p281
aVthis number is 85 percent.
p282
aVIn rural areas in India,
p283
aVif anything is to go by the recent
p284
aVgang rapes in Badaun and acid attacks in Odisha
p285
aVand Aligarh are supposed to go by,
p286
aVwe need to act really soon.
p287
aa(lp288
VDon't get me wrong,
p289
aVthe challenges that women will face
p290
aVin telling their stories is real,
p291
aVbut we need to start pursuing
p292
aVand trying to identify mediums
p293
aVto participate in our system
p294
aVand not just pursue the media blindly.
p295
aVToday, more women than ever
p296
aVare standing up and questioning
p297
aVthe government in India,
p298
aVand this is a result of that courage.
p299
aVThere is a sixfold increase in women
p300
aVreporting harassment,
p301
aVand the government passed
p302
aVthe Criminal Law (Amendment) Act in 2013
p303
aVto protect women against sexual assault.
p304
aa(lp305
VAs I end this talk,
p306
aVI just want to say
p307
aVthat I know a lot of us in this room have our secrets,
p308
aVbut let us speak up.
p309
aVLet us fight the shame and talk about it.
p310
aVIt could be a platform, a community,
p311
aVyour loved one, whoever or whatever you choose,
p312
aVbut let us speak up.
p313
aVThe truth is, the end to this problem
p314
aVbegins with us.
p315
aa(lp316
