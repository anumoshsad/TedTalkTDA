VI was only four years old
p4
aVwhen I saw my mother load a washing machine
p5
aVfor the very first time in her life.
p6
aVThat was a great day for my mother.
p7
aVMy mother and father had been saving money for years
p8
aVto be able to buy that machine,
p9
aVand the first day it was going to be used,
p10
aVeven Grandma was invited
p11
aVto see the machine.
p12
aVAnd Grandma was even more excited.
p13
aVThroughout her life
p14
aVshe had been heating water with firewood,
p15
aVand she had hand washed laundry
p16
aVfor seven children.
p17
aVAnd now she was going to watch
p18
aVelectricity do that work.
p19
aa(lp20
VMy mother carefully opened the door,
p21
aVand she loaded the laundry
p22
aVinto the machine,
p23
aVlike this.
p24
aVAnd then, when she closed the door,
p25
aVGrandma said, "No, no, no, no.
p26
aVLet me, let me push the button."
p27
aVAnd Grandma pushed the button,
p28
aVand she said, "Oh, fantastic!
p29
aVI want to see this! Give me a chair!
p30
aVGive me a chair! I want to see it,"
p31
aVand she sat down in front of the machine,
p32
aVand she watched the entire washing program.
p33
aVShe was mesmerized.
p34
aVTo my grandmother,
p35
aVthe washing machine was a miracle.
p36
aa(lp37
VToday, in Sweden and other rich countries,
p38
aVpeople are using
p39
aVso many different machines.
p40
aVLook, the homes are full of machines.
p41
aVI can't even name them all.
p42
aVAnd they also, when they want to travel,
p43
aVthey use flying machines
p44
aVthat can take them to remote destinations.
p45
aVAnd yet, in the world, there are so many people
p46
aVwho still heat the water on fire,
p47
aVand they cook their food on fire.
p48
aVSometimes they don't even have enough food,
p49
aVand they live below the poverty line.
p50
aVThere are two billion fellow human beings
p51
aVwho live on less than two dollars a day.
p52
aVAnd the richest people over there \u2014
p53
aVthere's one billion people \u2014
p54
aVand they live above what I call the "air line,"
p55
aVbecause they spend more than $80 a day
p56
aVon their consumption.
p57
aa(lp58
VBut this is just one, two, three billion people,
p59
aVand obviously there are seven billion people in the world,
p60
aVso there must be one, two, three, four billion people more
p61
aVwho live in between the poverty and the air line.
p62
aVThey have electricity,
p63
aVbut the question is, how many have washing machines?
p64
aVI've done the scrutiny of market data,
p65
aVand I've found that, indeed,
p66
aVthe washing machine has penetrated below the air line,
p67
aVand today there's an additional one billion people out there
p68
aVwho live above the "wash line."
p69
aV(Laughter)
p70
aVAnd they consume more than $40 per day.
p71
aVSo two billion have access to washing machines.
p72
aa(lp73
VAnd the remaining five billion,
p74
aVhow do they wash?
p75
aVOr, to be more precise,
p76
aVhow do most of the women in the world wash?
p77
aVBecause it remains hard work for women to wash.
p78
aVThey wash like this: by hand.
p79
aVIt's a hard, time-consuming labor,
p80
aVwhich they have to do for hours every week.
p81
aVAnd sometimes they also have to bring water from far away
p82
aVto do the laundry at home,
p83
aVor they have to bring the laundry away to a stream far off.
p84
aVAnd they want the washing machine.
p85
aVThey don't want to spend such a large part of their life
p86
aVdoing this hard work
p87
aVwith so relatively low productivity.
p88
aVAnd there's nothing different in their wish
p89
aVthan it was for my grandma.
p90
aVLook here, two generations ago in Sweden \u2014
p91
aVpicking water from the stream,
p92
aVheating with firewood and washing like that.
p93
aVThey want the washing machine in exactly the same way.
p94
aa(lp95
VBut when I lecture to environmentally-concerned students,
p96
aVthey tell me, "No, everybody in the world cannot have cars and washing machines."
p97
aVHow can we tell this woman
p98
aVthat she ain't going to have a washing machine?
p99
aVAnd then I ask my students,
p100
aVI've asked them \u2014 over the last two years I've asked,
p101
aV"How many of you doesn't use a car?"
p102
aVAnd some of them proudly raise their hand
p103
aVand say, "I don't use a car."
p104
aVAnd then I put the really tough question:
p105
aV"How many of you
p106
aVhand-wash your jeans and your bed sheets?"
p107
aVAnd no one raised their hand.
p108
aVEven the hardcore in the green movement
p109
aVuse washing machines.
p110
aa(lp111
V(Laughter)
p112
aa(lp113
VSo how come [this is] something that everyone uses
p114
aVand they think others will not stop it? What is special with this?
p115
aVI had to do an analysis about the energy used in the world.
p116
aVHere we are.
p117
aVLook here, you see the seven billion people up there:
p118
aVthe air people, the wash people,
p119
aVthe bulb people and the fire people.
p120
aVOne unit like this
p121
aVis an energy unit of fossil fuel \u2014
p122
aVoil, coal or gas.
p123
aVThat's what most of electricity and the energy in the world is.
p124
aVAnd it's 12 units used in the entire world,
p125
aVand the richest one billion, they use six of them.
p126
aVHalf of the energy is used by one seventh of the world's population.
p127
aVAnd these ones who have washing machines,
p128
aVbut not a house full of other machines,
p129
aVthey use two.
p130
aVThis group uses three, one each.
p131
aVAnd they also have electricity.
p132
aVAnd over there they don't even use one each.
p133
aVThat makes 12 of them.
p134
aa(lp135
VBut the main concern
p136
aVfor the environmentally-interested students \u2014 and they are right \u2014
p137
aVis about the future.
p138
aVWhat are the trends? If we just prolong the trends,
p139
aVwithout any real advanced analysis, to 2050,
p140
aVthere are two things that can increase the energy use.
p141
aVFirst, population growth.
p142
aVSecond, economic growth.
p143
aVPopulation growth will mainly occur among the poorest people here
p144
aVbecause they have high child mortality
p145
aVand they have many children per woman.
p146
aVAnd [with] that you will get two extra,
p147
aVbut that won't change the energy use very much.
p148
aa(lp149
VWhat will happen is economic growth.
p150
aVThe best of here in the emerging economies \u2014
p151
aVI call them the New East \u2014
p152
aVthey will jump the air line.
p153
aV"Wopp!" they will say.
p154
aVAnd they will start to use as much as the Old West are doing already.
p155
aVAnd these people, they want the washing machine.
p156
aVI told you. They'll go there.
p157
aVAnd they will double their energy use.
p158
aVAnd we hope that the poor people will get into the electric light.
p159
aVAnd they'll get a two-child family without a stop in population growth.
p160
aVBut the total energy consumption
p161
aVwill increase to 22 units.
p162
aVAnd these 22 units \u2014
p163
aVstill the richest people use most of it.
p164
aVSo what needs to be done?
p165
aVBecause the risk,
p166
aVthe high probability of climate change is real.
p167
aVIt's real.
p168
aVOf course they must be more energy-efficient.
p169
aVThey must change behavior in some way.
p170
aVThey must also start to produce green energy,
p171
aVmuch more green energy.
p172
aVBut until they have the same energy consumption per person,
p173
aVthey shouldn't give advice to others \u2014
p174
aVwhat to do and what not to do.
p175
aV(Applause)
p176
aVHere we can get more green energy all over.
p177
aa(lp178
VThis is what we hope may happen.
p179
aVIt's a real challenge in the future.
p180
aVBut I can assure you that this woman in the favela in Rio,
p181
aVshe wants a washing machine.
p182
aVShe's very happy about her minister of energy
p183
aVthat provided electricity to everyone \u2014
p184
aVso happy that she even voted for her.
p185
aVAnd she became Dilma Rousseff,
p186
aVthe president-elect
p187
aVof one of the biggest democracies in the world \u2014
p188
aVmoving from minister of energy to president.
p189
aVIf you have democracy,
p190
aVpeople will vote for washing machines.
p191
aVThey love them.
p192
aa(lp193
VAnd what's the magic with them?
p194
aVMy mother explained the magic with this machine
p195
aVthe very, very first day.
p196
aVShe said, "Now Hans,
p197
aVwe have loaded the laundry.
p198
aVThe machine will make the work.
p199
aVAnd now we can go to the library."
p200
aVBecause this is the magic:
p201
aVyou load the laundry,
p202
aVand what do you get out of the machine?
p203
aVYou get books out of the machines,
p204
aVchildren's books.
p205
aVAnd mother got time to read for me.
p206
aVShe loved this. I got the "ABC's" \u2014
p207
aVthis is where I started my career as a professor,
p208
aVwhen my mother had time to read for me.
p209
aVAnd she also got books for herself.
p210
aVShe managed to study English
p211
aVand learn that as a foreign language.
p212
aVAnd she read so many novels,
p213
aVso many different novels here.
p214
aVAnd we really, we really loved this machine.
p215
aa(lp216
VAnd what we said, my mother and me,
p217
aV"Thank you industrialization.
p218
aVThank you steel mill.
p219
aVThank you power station.
p220
aVAnd thank you chemical processing industry
p221
aVthat gave us time to read books."
p222
aa(lp223
VThank you very much.
