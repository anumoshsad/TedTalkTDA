VI'd like to start, if I may,
p4
aVwith the story of the Paisley snail.
p5
aVOn the evening of the 26th of August, 1928,
p6
aVMay Donoghue took a train from Glasgow
p7
aVto the town of Paisley, seven miles east of the city,
p8
aVand there at the Wellmeadow Café,
p9
aVshe had a Scots ice cream float,
p10
aVa mix of ice cream and ginger beer
p11
aVbought for her by a friend.
p12
aVThe ginger beer came in a brown, opaque bottle
p13
aVlabeled "D. Stevenson, Glen Lane, Paisley."
p14
aVShe drank some of the ice cream float,
p15
aVbut as the remaining ginger beer was poured
p16
aVinto her tumbler,
p17
aVa decomposed snail
p18
aVfloated to the surface of her glass.
p19
aVThree days later, she was admitted
p20
aVto the Glasgow Royal Infirmary
p21
aVand diagnosed with severe gastroenteritis
p22
aVand shock.
p23
aa(lp24
VThe case of Donoghue vs. Stevenson that followed
p25
aVset a very important legal precedent:
p26
aVStevenson, the manufacturer of the ginger beer,
p27
aVwas held to have a clear duty of care
p28
aVtowards May Donoghue,
p29
aVeven though there was no contract between them,
p30
aVand, indeed, she hadn't even bought the drink.
p31
aVOne of the judges, Lord Atkin, described it like this:
p32
aVYou must take care to avoid acts or omissions
p33
aVwhich you can reasonably foresee
p34
aVwould be likely to injure your neighbor.
p35
aVIndeed, one wonders that without a duty of care,
p36
aVhow many people would have had to suffer
p37
aVfrom gastroenteritis before Stevenson eventually went out of business.
p38
aa(lp39
VNow please hang on to that Paisley snail story,
p40
aVbecause it's an important principle.
p41
aVLast year, the Hansard Society, a nonpartisan charity
p42
aVwhich seeks to strengthen parliamentary democracy
p43
aVand encourage greater public involvement in politics
p44
aVpublished, alongside their annual audit
p45
aVof political engagement, an additional section
p46
aVdevoted entirely to politics and the media.
p47
aVHere are a couple of rather depressing observations
p48
aVfrom that survey.
p49
aVTabloid newspapers do not appear
p50
aVto advance the political citizenship of their readers,
p51
aVrelative even to those
p52
aVwho read no newspapers whatsoever.
p53
aVTabloid-only readers are twice as likely to agree
p54
aVwith a negative view of politics
p55
aVthan readers of no newspapers.
p56
aVThey're not just less politically engaged.
p57
aVThey are consuming media that reinforces
p58
aVtheir negative evaluation of politics,
p59
aVthereby contributing to a fatalistic and cynical
p60
aVattitude to democracy and their own role within it.
p61
aVLittle wonder that the report concluded that
p62
aVin this respect, the press, particularly the tabloids,
p63
aVappear not to be living up to the importance
p64
aVof their role in our democracy.
p65
aa(lp66
VNow I doubt if anyone in this room would seriously
p67
aVchallenge that view.
p68
aVBut if Hansard are right, and they usually are,
p69
aVthen we've got a very serious problem on our hands,
p70
aVand it's one that I'd like to spend the next 10 minutes
p71
aVfocusing upon.
p72
aa(lp73
VSince the Paisley snail,
p74
aVand especially over the past decade or so,
p75
aVa great deal of thinking has been developed
p76
aVaround the notion of a duty of care
p77
aVas it relates to a number of aspects of civil society.
p78
aVGenerally a duty of care arises when one individual
p79
aVor a group of individuals undertakes an activity
p80
aVwhich has the potential to cause harm to another,
p81
aVeither physically, mentally or economically.
p82
aVThis is principally focused on obvious areas,
p83
aVsuch as our empathetic response to children and young people,
p84
aVto our service personnel, and to the elderly and infirm.
p85
aVIt is seldom, if ever, extended to equally important arguments
p86
aVaround the fragility of our present system of government,
p87
aVto the notion that honesty, accuracy and impartiality
p88
aVare fundamental to the process of building
p89
aVand embedding an informed,
p90
aVparticipatory democracy.
p91
aVAnd the more you think about it,
p92
aVthe stranger that is.
p93
aa(lp94
VA couple of years ago, I had the pleasure
p95
aVof opening a brand new school
p96
aVin the northeast of England.
p97
aVIt had been renamed by its pupils as Academy 360.
p98
aVAs I walked through their impressive,
p99
aVglass-covered atrium,
p100
aVin front of me, emblazoned on the wall
p101
aVin letters of fire
p102
aVwas Marcus Aurelius's famous injunction:
p103
aVIf it's not true, don't say it;
p104
aVif it's not right, don't do it.
p105
aVThe head teacher saw me staring at it,
p106
aVand he said, "Oh, that's our school motto."
p107
aVOn the train back to London,
p108
aVI couldn't get it out of my mind.
p109
aVI kept thinking, can it really have taken us
p110
aVover 2,000 years to come to terms
p111
aVwith that simple notion
p112
aVas being our minimum expectation of each other?
p113
aVIsn't it time that we develop this concept
p114
aVof a duty of care
p115
aVand extended it to include a care
p116
aVfor our shared but increasingly endangered democratic values?
p117
aVAfter all, the absence of a duty of care
p118
aVwithin many professions
p119
aVcan all too easily amount to accusations of negligence,
p120
aVand that being the case, can we be really comfortable with the thought
p121
aVthat we're in effect being negligent
p122
aVin respect of the health of our own societies
p123
aVand the values that necessarily underpin them?
p124
aVCould anyone honestly suggest, on the evidence,
p125
aVthat the same media which Hansard so roundly condemned
p126
aVhave taken sufficient care to avoid behaving
p127
aVin ways which they could reasonably have foreseen
p128
aVwould be likely to undermine or even damage
p129
aVour inherently fragile democratic settlement.
p130
aa(lp131
VNow there will be those who will argue
p132
aVthat this could all too easily drift into a form
p133
aVof censorship, albeit self-censorship,
p134
aVbut I don't buy that argument.
p135
aVIt has to be possible
p136
aVto balance freedom of expression
p137
aVwith wider moral and social responsibilities.
p138
aa(lp139
VLet me explain why by taking the example
p140
aVfrom my own career as a filmmaker.
p141
aVThroughout that career, I never accepted
p142
aVthat a filmmaker should set about putting
p143
aVtheir own work outside or above what he or she
p144
aVbelieved to be a decent set of values
p145
aVfor their own life, their own family,
p146
aVand the future of the society in which we all live.
p147
aVI'd go further.
p148
aVA responsible filmmaker should never devalue their work
p149
aVto a point at which it becomes less than true
p150
aVto the world they themselves wish to inhabit.
p151
aVAs I see it, filmmakers, journalists, even bloggers
p152
aVare all required to face up to the social expectations
p153
aVthat come with combining the intrinsic power of their medium
p154
aVwith their well-honed professional skills.
p155
aVObviously this is not a mandated duty,
p156
aVbut for the gifted filmmaker and the responsible journalist
p157
aVor even blogger, it strikes me as being utterly inescapable.
p158
aa(lp159
VWe should always remember that our notion
p160
aVof individual freedom and its partner, creative freedom,
p161
aVis comparatively new
p162
aVin the history of Western ideas,
p163
aVand for that reason, it's often undervalued
p164
aVand can be very quickly undermined.
p165
aVIt's a prize easily lost,
p166
aVand once lost, once surrendered,
p167
aVit can prove very, very hard to reclaim.
p168
aVAnd its first line of defense
p169
aVhas to be our own standards,
p170
aVnot those enforced on us by a censor or legislation,
p171
aVour own standards and our own integrity.
p172
aVOur integrity as we deal with those
p173
aVwith whom we work
p174
aVand our own standards as we operate within society.
p175
aVAnd these standards of ours
p176
aVneed to be all of a piece with a sustainable social agenda.
p177
aVThey're part of a collective responsibility,
p178
aVthe responsibility of the artist or the journalist
p179
aVto deal with the world as it really is,
p180
aVand this, in turn, must go hand in hand
p181
aVwith the responsibility of those governing society
p182
aVto also face up to that world,
p183
aVand not to be tempted to misappropriate
p184
aVthe causes of its ills.
p185
aVYet, as has become strikingly clear
p186
aVover the last couple of years,
p187
aVsuch responsibility has to a very great extent
p188
aVbeen abrogated by large sections of the media.
p189
aVAnd as a consequence, across the Western world,
p190
aVthe over-simplistic policies of the parties of protest
p191
aVand their appeal to a largely disillusioned,
p192
aVolder demographic,
p193
aValong with the apathy and obsession with the trivial
p194
aVthat typifies at least some of the young,
p195
aVtaken together, these and other similarly
p196
aVcontemporary aberrations
p197
aVare threatening to squeeze the life
p198
aVout of active, informed debate and engagement,
p199
aVand I stress active.
p200
aa(lp201
VThe most ardent of libertarians might argue
p202
aVthat Donoghue v. Stevenson should have been thrown out of court
p203
aVand that Stevenson would eventually have gone out of business
p204
aVif he'd continued to sell ginger beer with snails in it.
p205
aVBut most of us, I think, accept some small role
p206
aVfor the state to enforce a duty of care,
p207
aVand the key word here is reasonable.
p208
aVJudges must ask, did they take reasonable care
p209
aVand could they have reasonably foreseen
p210
aVthe consequences of their actions?
p211
aVFar from signifying overbearing state power,
p212
aVit's that small common sense test of reasonableness
p213
aVthat I'd like us to apply to those in the media
p214
aVwho, after all, set the tone and the content
p215
aVfor much of our democratic discourse.
p216
aa(lp217
VDemocracy, in order to work, requires that
p218
aVreasonable men and women take the time to understand and debate
p219
aVdifficult, sometimes complex issues,
p220
aVand they do so in an atmosphere which strives
p221
aVfor the type of understanding that leads to,
p222
aVif not agreement, then at least a productive
p223
aVand workable compromise.
p224
aVPolitics is about choices,
p225
aVand within those choices, politics is about priorities.
p226
aVIt's about reconciling conflicting preferences
p227
aVwherever and whenever possibly based on fact.
p228
aVBut if the facts themselves are distorted,
p229
aVthe resolutions are likely only to create further conflict,
p230
aVwith all the stresses and strains on society
p231
aVthat inevitably follow.
p232
aVThe media have to decide:
p233
aVDo they see their role as being to inflame
p234
aVor to inform?
p235
aVBecause in the end, it comes down to a combination
p236
aVof trust and leadership.
p237
aa(lp238
VFifty years ago this week, President John F. Kennedy
p239
aVmade two epoch-making speeches,
p240
aVthe first on disarmament and the second on civil rights.
p241
aVThe first led almost immediately
p242
aVto the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty,
p243
aVand the second led to the 1964 Civil Rights Act,
p244
aVboth of which represented giant leaps forward.
p245
aVDemocracy, well-led and well-informed,
p246
aVcan achieve very great things,
p247
aVbut there's a precondition.
p248
aVWe have to trust that those making those decisions
p249
aVare acting in the best interest not of themselves
p250
aVbut of the whole of the people.
p251
aVWe need factually-based options,
p252
aVclearly laid out,
p253
aVnot those of a few powerful
p254
aVand potentially manipulative corporations
p255
aVpursuing their own frequently narrow agendas,
p256
aVbut accurate, unprejudiced information
p257
aVwith which to make our own judgments.
p258
aVIf we want to provide decent, fulfilling lives
p259
aVfor our children and our children's children,
p260
aVwe need to exercise to the very greatest degree possible
p261
aVthat duty of care for a vibrant,
p262
aVand hopefully a lasting, democracy.
p263
aVThank you very much for listening to me.
