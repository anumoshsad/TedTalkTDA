VIn 2007, I became the attorney general
p4
aVof the state of New Jersey.
p5
aVBefore that, I'd been a criminal prosecutor,
p6
aVfirst in the Manhattan district attorney's office,
p7
aVand then at the United States Department of Justice.
p8
aa(lp9
VBut when I became the attorney general,
p10
aVtwo things happened that changed  the way I see criminal justice.
p11
aVThe first is that I asked what I thought
p12
aVwere really basic questions.
p13
aVI wanted to understand who we were arresting,
p14
aVwho we were charging,
p15
aVand who we were putting in our nation's jails
p16
aVand prisons.
p17
aVI also wanted to understand
p18
aVif we were making decisions
p19
aVin a way that made us safer.
p20
aVAnd I couldn't get this information out.
p21
aVIt turned out that most big criminal justice agencies
p22
aVlike my own
p23
aVdidn't track the things that matter.
p24
aVSo after about a month of being incredibly frustrated,
p25
aVI walked down into a conference room
p26
aVthat was filled with detectives
p27
aVand stacks and stacks of case files,
p28
aVand the detectives were sitting there
p29
aVwith yellow legal pads taking notes.
p30
aVThey were trying to get the information
p31
aVI was looking for
p32
aVby going through case by case
p33
aVfor the past five years.
p34
aVAnd as you can imagine,
p35
aVwhen we finally got the results, they weren't good.
p36
aVIt turned out that we were doing
p37
aVa lot of low-level drug cases
p38
aVon the streets just around the corner
p39
aVfrom our office in Trenton.
p40
aa(lp41
VThe second thing that happened
p42
aVis that I spent the day in the Camden, New Jersey police department.
p43
aVNow, at that time, Camden, New Jersey,
p44
aVwas the most dangerous city in America.
p45
aVI ran the Camden Police Department because of that.
p46
aVI spent the day in the police department,
p47
aVand I was taken into a room with senior police officials,
p48
aVall of whom were working hard
p49
aVand trying very hard to reduce crime in Camden.
p50
aVAnd what I saw in that room,
p51
aVas we talked about how to reduce crime,
p52
aVwere a series of officers with a lot of little yellow sticky notes.
p53
aVAnd they would take a yellow sticky and they would write something on it
p54
aVand they would put it up on a board.
p55
aVAnd one of them said,  "We had a robbery two weeks ago.
p56
aVWe have no suspects."
p57
aVAnd another said, "We had a shooting in this neighborhood last week. We have no suspects."
p58
aVWe weren't using data-driven policing.
p59
aVWe were essentially trying to fight crime
p60
aVwith yellow Post-it notes.
p61
aa(lp62
VNow, both of these things made me realize
p63
aVfundamentally that we were failing.
p64
aVWe didn't even know who was in our criminal justice system,
p65
aVwe didn't have any data about the things that mattered,
p66
aVand we didn't share data or use analytics
p67
aVor tools to help us make better decisions
p68
aVand to reduce crime.
p69
aVAnd for the first time, I started to think
p70
aVabout how we made decisions.
p71
aVWhen I was an assistant D.A.,
p72
aVand when I was a federal prosecutor,
p73
aVI looked at the cases in front of me,
p74
aVand I generally made decisions based on my instinct
p75
aVand my experience.
p76
aVWhen I became attorney general,
p77
aVI could look at the system as a whole,
p78
aVand what surprised me is that I found
p79
aVthat that was exactly how we were doing it
p80
aVacross the entire system \u2014
p81
aVin police departments, in prosecutors's offices,
p82
aVin courts and in jails.
p83
aVAnd what I learned very quickly
p84
aVis that we weren't doing a good job.
p85
aVSo I wanted to do things differently.
p86
aVI wanted to introduce data and analytics
p87
aVand rigorous statistical analysis
p88
aVinto our work.
p89
aVIn short, I wanted to moneyball criminal justice.
p90
aa(lp91
VNow, moneyball, as many of you know,
p92
aVis what the Oakland A's did,
p93
aVwhere they used smart data and statistics
p94
aVto figure out how to pick players
p95
aVthat would help them win games,
p96
aVand they went from a system that  was based on baseball scouts
p97
aVwho used to go out and watch players
p98
aVand use their instinct and experience,
p99
aVthe scouts' instincts and experience,
p100
aVto pick players, from one to use
p101
aVsmart data and rigorous statistical analysis
p102
aVto figure out how to pick players that would help them win games.
p103
aa(lp104
VIt worked for the Oakland A's,
p105
aVand it worked in the state of New Jersey.
p106
aVWe took Camden off the top of the list
p107
aVas the most dangerous city in America.
p108
aVWe reduced murders there by 41 percent,
p109
aVwhich actually means 37 lives were saved.
p110
aVAnd we reduced all crime in the city by 26 percent.
p111
aVWe also changed the way we did criminal prosecutions.
p112
aVSo we went from doing low-level drug crimes
p113
aVthat were outside our building
p114
aVto doing cases of statewide importance,
p115
aVon things like reducing violence with the most violent offenders,
p116
aVprosecuting street gangs,
p117
aVgun and drug trafficking, and political corruption.
p118
aa(lp119
VAnd all of this matters greatly,
p120
aVbecause public safety to me
p121
aVis the most important function of government.
p122
aVIf we're not safe, we can't be educated,
p123
aVwe can't be healthy,
p124
aVwe can't do any of the other things we want to do in our lives.
p125
aVAnd we live in a country today
p126
aVwhere we face serious criminal justice problems.
p127
aVWe have 12 million arrests every single year.
p128
aVThe vast majority of those arrests
p129
aVare for low-level crimes, like misdemeanors,
p130
aV70 to 80 percent.
p131
aVLess than five percent of all arrests
p132
aVare for violent crime.
p133
aVYet we spend 75 billion,
p134
aVthat's b for billion,
p135
aVdollars a year on state and local corrections costs.
p136
aVRight now, today, we have 2.3 million people
p137
aVin our jails and prisons.
p138
aVAnd we face unbelievable public safety challenges
p139
aVbecause we have a situation
p140
aVin which two thirds of the people in our jails
p141
aVare there waiting for trial.
p142
aVThey haven't yet been convicted of a crime.
p143
aVThey're just waiting for their day in court.
p144
aVAnd 67 percent of people come back.
p145
aVOur recidivism rate is amongst  the highest in the world.
p146
aVAlmost seven in 10 people who are released
p147
aVfrom prison will be rearrested
p148
aVin a constant cycle of crime and incarceration.
p149
aa(lp150
VSo when I started my job at the Arnold Foundation,
p151
aVI came back to looking at a lot of these questions,
p152
aVand I came back to thinking about how
p153
aVwe had used data and analytics to transform
p154
aVthe way we did criminal justice in New Jersey.
p155
aVAnd when I look at the criminal justice system
p156
aVin the United States today,
p157
aVI feel the exact same way that I did
p158
aVabout the state of New Jersey when I started there,
p159
aVwhich is that we absolutely have to do better,
p160
aVand I know that we can do better.
p161
aa(lp162
VSo I decided to focus
p163
aVon using data and analytics
p164
aVto help make the most critical decision
p165
aVin public safety,
p166
aVand that decision is the determination
p167
aVof whether, when someone has been arrested,
p168
aVwhether they pose a risk to public safety
p169
aVand should be detained,
p170
aVor whether they don't pose a risk to public safety
p171
aVand should be released.
p172
aVEverything that happens in criminal cases
p173
aVcomes out of this one decision.
p174
aVIt impacts everything.
p175
aVIt impacts sentencing.
p176
aVIt impacts whether someone gets drug treatment.
p177
aVIt impacts crime and violence.
p178
aVAnd when I talk to judges around the United States,
p179
aVwhich I do all the time now,
p180
aVthey all say the same thing,
p181
aVwhich is that we put dangerous people in jail,
p182
aVand we let non-dangerous, nonviolent people out.
p183
aVThey mean it and they believe it.
p184
aVBut when you start to look at the data,
p185
aVwhich, by the way, the judges don't have,
p186
aVwhen we start to look at the data,
p187
aVwhat we find time and time again,
p188
aVis that this isn't the case.
p189
aVWe find low-risk offenders,
p190
aVwhich makes up 50 percent of our entire criminal justice population,
p191
aVwe find that they're in jail.
p192
aVTake Leslie Chew, who was a Texas man
p193
aVwho stole four blankets on a cold winter night.
p194
aVHe was arrested, and he was kept in jail
p195
aVon 3,500 dollars bail,
p196
aVan amount that he could not afford to pay.
p197
aVAnd he stayed in jail for eight months
p198
aVuntil his case came up for trial,
p199
aVat a cost to taxpayers of more than 9,000 dollars.
p200
aVAnd at the other end of the spectrum,
p201
aVwe're doing an equally terrible job.
p202
aVThe people who we find
p203
aVare the highest-risk offenders,
p204
aVthe people who we think have the highest likelihood
p205
aVof committing a new crime if they're released,
p206
aVwe see nationally that 50 percent of those people
p207
aVare being released.
p208
aa(lp209
VThe reason for this is the way we make decisions.
p210
aVJudges have the best intentions
p211
aVwhen they make these decisions about risk,
p212
aVbut they're making them subjectively.
p213
aVThey're like the baseball scouts 20 years ago
p214
aVwho were using their instinct and their experience
p215
aVto try to decide what risk someone poses.
p216
aVThey're being subjective,
p217
aVand we know what happens with subjective decision making,
p218
aVwhich is that we are often wrong.
p219
aVWhat we need in this space
p220
aVare strong data and analytics.
p221
aa(lp222
VWhat I decided to look for
p223
aVwas a strong data and analytic risk assessment tool,
p224
aVsomething that would let judges actually understand
p225
aVwith a scientific and objective way
p226
aVwhat the risk was that was posed
p227
aVby someone in front of them.
p228
aVI looked all over the country,
p229
aVand I found that between five and 10 percent
p230
aVof all U.S. jurisdictions
p231
aVactually use any type of risk assessment tool,
p232
aVand when I looked at these tools,
p233
aVI quickly realized why.
p234
aVThey were unbelievably expensive to administer,
p235
aVthey were time-consuming,
p236
aVthey were limited to the local jurisdiction
p237
aVin which they'd been created.
p238
aVSo basically, they couldn't be scaled
p239
aVor transferred to other places.
p240
aa(lp241
VSo I went out and built a phenomenal team
p242
aVof data scientists and researchers
p243
aVand statisticians
p244
aVto build a universal risk assessment tool,
p245
aVso that every single judge in the United States of America
p246
aVcan have an objective, scientific measure of risk.
p247
aVIn the tool that we've built,
p248
aVwhat we did was we collected 1.5 million cases
p249
aVfrom all around the United States,
p250
aVfrom cities, from counties,
p251
aVfrom every single state in the country,
p252
aVthe federal districts.
p253
aVAnd with those 1.5 million cases,
p254
aVwhich is the largest data set on pretrial
p255
aVin the United States today,
p256
aVwe were able to basically find that there were
p257
aV900-plus risk factors that we could look at
p258
aVto try to figure out what mattered most.
p259
aVAnd we found that there were nine specific things
p260
aVthat mattered all across the country
p261
aVand that were the most highly predictive of risk.
p262
aVAnd so we built a universal risk assessment tool.
p263
aVAnd it looks like this.
p264
aVAs you'll see, we put some information in,
p265
aVbut most of it is incredibly simple,
p266
aVit's easy to use,
p267
aVit focuses on things like the defendant's prior convictions,
p268
aVwhether they've been sentenced to incarceration,
p269
aVwhether they've engaged in violence before,
p270
aVwhether they've even failed to come back to court.
p271
aVAnd with this tool, we can predict three things.
p272
aVFirst, whether or not someone will commit
p273
aVa new crime if they're released.
p274
aVSecond, for the first time,
p275
aVand I think this is incredibly important,
p276
aVwe can predict whether someone will commit
p277
aVan act of violence if they're released.
p278
aVAnd that's the single most important thing
p279
aVthat judges say when you talk to them.
p280
aVAnd third, we can predict whether someone
p281
aVwill come back to court.
p282
aVAnd every single judge in the United States of America can use it,
p283
aVbecause it's been created on a universal data set.
p284
aa(lp285
VWhat judges see if they run the risk assessment tool
p286
aVis this \u2014 it's a dashboard.
p287
aVAt the top, you see the New Criminal Activity Score,
p288
aVsix of course being the highest,
p289
aVand then in the middle you see, "Elevated risk of violence."
p290
aVWhat that says is that this person
p291
aVis someone who has an elevated risk of violence
p292
aVthat the judge should look twice at.
p293
aVAnd then, towards the bottom,
p294
aVyou see the Failure to Appear Score,
p295
aVwhich again is the likelihood
p296
aVthat someone will come back to court.
p297
aa(lp298
VNow I want to say something really important.
p299
aVIt's not that I think we should be eliminating
p300
aVthe judge's instinct and experience
p301
aVfrom this process.
p302
aVI don't.
p303
aVI actually believe the problem that we see
p304
aVand the reason that we have these incredible system errors,
p305
aVwhere we're incarcerating low-level, nonviolent people
p306
aVand we're releasing high-risk, dangerous people,
p307
aVis that we don't have an objective measure of risk.
p308
aVBut what I believe should happen
p309
aVis that we should take that data-driven risk assessment
p310
aVand combine that with the judge's instinct and experience
p311
aVto lead us to better decision making.
p312
aVThe tool went statewide in Kentucky on July 1,
p313
aVand we're about to go up in a number of other U.S. jurisdictions.
p314
aVOur goal, quite simply, is that every single judge
p315
aVin the United States will use a data-driven risk tool
p316
aVwithin the next five years.
p317
aVWe're now working on risk tools
p318
aVfor prosecutors and for police officers as well,
p319
aVto try to take a system that runs today
p320
aVin America the same way it did 50 years ago,
p321
aVbased on instinct and experience,
p322
aVand make it into one that runs
p323
aVon data and analytics.
p324
aa(lp325
VNow, the great news about all this,
p326
aVand we have a ton of work left to do,
p327
aVand we have a lot of culture to change,
p328
aVbut the great news about all of it
p329
aVis that we know it works.
p330
aVIt's why Google is Google,
p331
aVand it's why all these baseball teams use moneyball
p332
aVto win games.
p333
aVThe great news for us as well
p334
aVis that it's the way that we can transform
p335
aVthe American criminal justice system.
p336
aVIt's how we can make our streets safer,
p337
aVwe can reduce our prison costs,
p338
aVand we can make our system much fairer
p339
aVand more just.
p340
aVSome people call it data science.
p341
aVI call it moneyballing criminal justice.
