VI'm a neuroscientist.
p4
aVAnd in neuroscience,
p5
aVwe have to deal with many difficult questions about the brain.
p6
aVBut I want to start with the easiest question
p7
aVand the question you really should have all asked yourselves at some point in your life,
p8
aVbecause it's a fundamental question
p9
aVif we want to understand brain function.
p10
aVAnd that is, why do we and other animals
p11
aVhave brains?
p12
aVNot all species on our planet have brains,
p13
aVso if we want to know what the brain is for,
p14
aVlet's think about why we evolved one.
p15
aVNow you may reason that we have one
p16
aVto perceive the world or to think,
p17
aVand that's completely wrong.
p18
aVIf you think about this question for any length of time,
p19
aVit's blindingly obvious why we have a brain.
p20
aVWe have a brain for one reason and one reason only,
p21
aVand that's to produce adaptable and complex movements.
p22
aVThere is no other reason to have a brain.
p23
aVThink about it.
p24
aVMovement is the only way you have
p25
aVof affecting the world around you.
p26
aVNow that's not quite true. There's one other way, and that's through sweating.
p27
aVBut apart from that,
p28
aVeverything else goes through contractions of muscles.
p29
aa(lp30
VSo think about communication \u2014
p31
aVspeech, gestures, writing, sign language \u2014
p32
aVthey're all mediated through contractions of your muscles.
p33
aVSo it's really important to remember
p34
aVthat sensory, memory and cognitive processes are all important,
p35
aVbut they're only important
p36
aVto either drive or suppress future movements.
p37
aVThere can be no evolutionary advantage
p38
aVto laying down memories of childhood
p39
aVor perceiving the color of a rose
p40
aVif it doesn't affect the way you're going to move later in life.
p41
aa(lp42
VNow for those who don't believe this argument,
p43
aVwe have trees and grass on our planet without the brain,
p44
aVbut the clinching evidence is this animal here \u2014
p45
aVthe humble sea squirt.
p46
aVRudimentary animal, has a nervous system,
p47
aVswims around in the ocean in its juvenile life.
p48
aVAnd at some point of its life,
p49
aVit implants on a rock.
p50
aVAnd the first thing it does in implanting on that rock, which it never leaves,
p51
aVis to digest its own brain and nervous system
p52
aVfor food.
p53
aVSo once you don't need to move,
p54
aVyou don't need the luxury of that brain.
p55
aVAnd this animal is often taken
p56
aVas an analogy to what happens at universities
p57
aVwhen professors get tenure,
p58
aVbut that's a different subject.
p59
aa(lp60
V(Applause)
p61
aa(lp62
VSo I am a movement chauvinist.
p63
aVI believe movement is the most important function of the brain \u2014
p64
aVdon't let anyone tell you that it's not true.
p65
aVNow if movement is so important,
p66
aVhow well are we doing
p67
aVunderstanding how the brain controls movement?
p68
aVAnd the answer is we're doing extremely poorly; it's a very hard problem.
p69
aVBut we can look at how well we're doing
p70
aVby thinking about how well we're doing building machines
p71
aVwhich can do what humans can do.
p72
aa(lp73
VThink about the game of chess.
p74
aVHow well are we doing determining what piece to move where?
p75
aVIf you pit Garry Kasparov here, when he's not in jail,
p76
aVagainst IBM's Deep Blue,
p77
aVwell the answer is IBM's Deep Blue will occasionally win.
p78
aVAnd I think if IBM's Deep Blue played anyone in this room, it would win every time.
p79
aVThat problem is solved.
p80
aVWhat about the problem
p81
aVof picking up a chess piece,
p82
aVdexterously manipulating it and putting it back down on the board?
p83
aVIf you put a five year-old child's dexterity against the best robots of today,
p84
aVthe answer is simple:
p85
aVthe child wins easily.
p86
aVThere's no competition at all.
p87
aa(lp88
VNow why is that top problem so easy
p89
aVand the bottom problem so hard?
p90
aVOne reason is a very smart five year-old
p91
aVcould tell you the algorithm for that top problem \u2014
p92
aVlook at all possible moves to the end of the game
p93
aVand choose the one that makes you win.
p94
aVSo it's a very simple algorithm.
p95
aVNow of course there are other moves,
p96
aVbut with vast computers we approximate
p97
aVand come close to the optimal solution.
p98
aVWhen it comes to being dexterous,
p99
aVit's not even clear what the algorithm is you have to solve to be dexterous.
p100
aVAnd we'll see you have to both perceive and act on the world,
p101
aVwhich has a lot of problems.
p102
aa(lp103
VBut let me show you cutting-edge robotics.
p104
aVNow a lot of robotics is very impressive,
p105
aVbut manipulation robotics is really just in the dark ages.
p106
aVSo this is the end of a Ph.D. project
p107
aVfrom one of the best robotics institutes.
p108
aVAnd the student has trained this robot
p109
aVto pour this water into a glass.
p110
aVIt's a hard problem because the water sloshes about, but it can do it.
p111
aVBut it doesn't do it with anything like the agility of a human.
p112
aVNow if you want this robot to do a different task,
p113
aVthat's another three-year Ph.D. program.
p114
aVThere is no generalization at all
p115
aVfrom one task to another in robotics.
p116
aa(lp117
VNow we can compare this
p118
aVto cutting-edge human performance.
p119
aVSo what I'm going to show you is Emily Fox
p120
aVwinning the world record for cup stacking.
p121
aVNow the Americans in the audience will know all about cup stacking.
p122
aVIt's a high school sport
p123
aVwhere you have 12 cups you have to stack and unstack
p124
aVagainst the clock in a prescribed order.
p125
aVAnd this is her getting the world record in real time.
p126
aV(Laughter)
p127
aV(Applause)
p128
aVAnd she's pretty happy.
p129
aVWe have no idea what is going on inside her brain when she does that,
p130
aVand that's what we'd like to know.
p131
aa(lp132
VSo in my group, what we try to do
p133
aVis reverse engineer how humans control movement.
p134
aVAnd it sounds like an easy problem.
p135
aVYou send a command down, it causes muscles to contract.
p136
aVYour arm or body moves,
p137
aVand you get sensory feedback from vision, from skin, from muscles and so on.
p138
aVThe trouble is
p139
aVthese signals are not the beautiful signals you want them to be.
p140
aVSo one thing that makes controlling movement difficult
p141
aVis, for example, sensory feedback is extremely noisy.
p142
aVNow by noise, I do not mean sound.
p143
aVWe use it in the engineering and neuroscience sense
p144
aVmeaning a random noise corrupting a signal.
p145
aVSo the old days before digital radio when you were tuning in your radio
p146
aVand you heard "crrcckkk" on the station you wanted to hear,
p147
aVthat was the noise.
p148
aVBut more generally, this noise is something that corrupts the signal.
p149
aa(lp150
VSo for example, if you put your hand under a table
p151
aVand try to localize it with your other hand,
p152
aVyou can be off by several centimeters
p153
aVdue to the noise in sensory feedback.
p154
aVSimilarly, when you put motor output on movement output,
p155
aVit's extremely noisy.
p156
aVForget about trying to hit the bull's eye in darts,
p157
aVjust aim for the same spot over and over again.
p158
aVYou have a huge spread due to movement variability.
p159
aVAnd more than that, the outside world, or task,
p160
aVis both ambiguous and variable.
p161
aVThe teapot could be full, it could be empty.
p162
aVIt changes over time.
p163
aVSo we work in a whole sensory movement task soup of noise.
p164
aa(lp165
VNow this noise is so great
p166
aVthat society places a huge premium
p167
aVon those of us who can reduce the consequences of noise.
p168
aVSo if you're lucky enough to be able to knock a small white ball
p169
aVinto a hole several hundred yards away using a long metal stick,
p170
aVour society will be willing to reward you
p171
aVwith hundreds of millions of dollars.
p172
aa(lp173
VNow what I want to convince you of
p174
aVis the brain also goes through a lot of effort
p175
aVto reduce the negative consequences
p176
aVof this sort of noise and variability.
p177
aVAnd to do that, I'm going to tell you about a framework
p178
aVwhich is very popular in statistics and machine learning of the last 50 years
p179
aVcalled Bayesian decision theory.
p180
aVAnd it's more recently a unifying way
p181
aVto think about how the brain deals with uncertainty.
p182
aVAnd the fundamental idea is you want to make inferences and then take actions.
p183
aa(lp184
VSo let's think about the inference.
p185
aVYou want to generate beliefs about the world.
p186
aVSo what are beliefs?
p187
aVBeliefs could be: where are my arms in space?
p188
aVAm I looking at a cat or a fox?
p189
aVBut we're going to represent beliefs with probabilities.
p190
aVSo we're going to represent a belief
p191
aVwith a number between zero and one \u2014
p192
aVzero meaning I don't believe it at all, one means I'm absolutely certain.
p193
aVAnd numbers in between give you the gray levels of uncertainty.
p194
aVAnd the key idea to Bayesian inference
p195
aVis you have two sources of information
p196
aVfrom which to make your inference.
p197
aVYou have data,
p198
aVand data in neuroscience is sensory input.
p199
aVSo I have sensory input, which I can take in to make beliefs.
p200
aVBut there's another source of information, and that's effectively prior knowledge.
p201
aVYou accumulate knowledge throughout your life in memories.
p202
aVAnd the point about Bayesian decision theory
p203
aVis it gives you the mathematics
p204
aVof the optimal way to combine
p205
aVyour prior knowledge with your sensory evidence
p206
aVto generate new beliefs.
p207
aa(lp208
VAnd I've put the formula up there.
p209
aVI'm not going to explain what that formula is, but it's very beautiful.
p210
aVAnd it has real beauty and real explanatory power.
p211
aVAnd what it really says, and what you want to estimate,
p212
aVis the probability of different beliefs
p213
aVgiven your sensory input.
p214
aVSo let me give you an intuitive example.
p215
aVImagine you're learning to play tennis
p216
aVand you want to decide where the ball is going to bounce
p217
aVas it comes over the net towards you.
p218
aVThere are two sources of information
p219
aVBayes' rule tells you.
p220
aVThere's sensory evidence \u2014 you can use visual information auditory information,
p221
aVand that might tell you it's going to land in that red spot.
p222
aVBut you know that your senses are not perfect,
p223
aVand therefore there's some variability of where it's going to land
p224
aVshown by that cloud of red,
p225
aVrepresenting numbers between 0.5 and maybe 0.1.
p226
aa(lp227
VThat information is available in the current shot,
p228
aVbut there's another source of information
p229
aVnot available on the current shot,
p230
aVbut only available by repeated experience in the game of tennis,
p231
aVand that's that the ball doesn't bounce
p232
aVwith equal probability over the court during the match.
p233
aVIf you're playing against a very good opponent,
p234
aVthey may distribute it in that green area,
p235
aVwhich is the prior distribution,
p236
aVmaking it hard for you to return.
p237
aVNow both these sources of information carry important information.
p238
aVAnd what Bayes' rule says
p239
aVis that I should multiply the numbers on the red by the numbers on the green
p240
aVto get the numbers of the yellow, which have the ellipses,
p241
aVand that's my belief.
p242
aVSo it's the optimal way of combining information.
p243
aa(lp244
VNow I wouldn't tell you all this if it wasn't that a few years ago,
p245
aVwe showed this is exactly what people do
p246
aVwhen they learn new movement skills.
p247
aVAnd what it means
p248
aVis we really are Bayesian inference machines.
p249
aVAs we go around, we learn about statistics of the world and lay that down,
p250
aVbut we also learn
p251
aVabout how noisy our own sensory apparatus is,
p252
aVand then combine those
p253
aVin a real Bayesian way.
p254
aa(lp255
VNow a key part to the Bayesian is this part of the formula.
p256
aVAnd what this part really says
p257
aVis I have to predict the probability
p258
aVof different sensory feedbacks
p259
aVgiven my beliefs.
p260
aVSo that really means I have to make predictions of the future.
p261
aVAnd I want to convince you the brain does make predictions
p262
aVof the sensory feedback it's going to get.
p263
aVAnd moreover, it profoundly changes your perceptions
p264
aVby what you do.
p265
aVAnd to do that, I'll tell you
p266
aVabout how the brain deals with sensory input.
p267
aVSo you send a command out,
p268
aVyou get sensory feedback back,
p269
aVand that transformation is governed
p270
aVby the physics of your body and your sensory apparatus.
p271
aa(lp272
VBut you can imagine looking inside the brain.
p273
aVAnd here's inside the brain.
p274
aVYou might have a little predictor, a neural simulator,
p275
aVof the physics of your body and your senses.
p276
aVSo as you send a movement command down,
p277
aVyou tap a copy of that off
p278
aVand run it into your neural simulator
p279
aVto anticipate the sensory consequences of your actions.
p280
aVSo as I shake this ketchup bottle,
p281
aVI get some true sensory feedback as the function of time in the bottom row.
p282
aVAnd if I've got a good predictor, it predicts the same thing.
p283
aa(lp284
VWell why would I bother doing that?
p285
aVI'm going to get the same feedback anyway.
p286
aVWell there's good reasons.
p287
aVImagine, as I shake the ketchup bottle,
p288
aVsomeone very kindly comes up to me and taps it on the back for me.
p289
aVNow I get an extra source of sensory information
p290
aVdue to that external act.
p291
aVSo I get two sources.
p292
aVI get you tapping on it, and I get me shaking it,
p293
aVbut from my senses' point of view,
p294
aVthat is combined together into one source of information.
p295
aa(lp296
VNow there's good reason to believe
p297
aVthat you would want to be able to distinguish external events from internal events.
p298
aVBecause external events are actually much more behaviorally relevant
p299
aVthan feeling everything that's going on inside my body.
p300
aVSo one way to reconstruct that
p301
aVis to compare the prediction \u2014
p302
aVwhich is only based on your movement commands \u2014
p303
aVwith the reality.
p304
aVAny discrepancy should hopefully be external.
p305
aVSo as I go around the world,
p306
aVI'm making predictions of what I should get, subtracting them off.
p307
aVEverything left over is external to me.
p308
aa(lp309
VWhat evidence is there for this?
p310
aVWell there's one very clear example
p311
aVwhere a sensation generated by myself feels very different
p312
aVthen if generated by another person.
p313
aVAnd so we decided the most obvious place to start
p314
aVwas with tickling.
p315
aVIt's been known for a long time, you can't tickle yourself
p316
aVas well as other people can.
p317
aVBut it hasn't really been shown, it's because you have a neural simulator,
p318
aVsimulating your own body
p319
aVand subtracting off that sense.
p320
aVSo we can bring the experiments of the 21st century
p321
aVby applying robotic technologies to this problem.
p322
aVAnd in effect, what we have is some sort of stick in one hand attached to a robot,
p323
aVand they're going to move that back and forward.
p324
aVAnd then we're going to track that with a computer
p325
aVand use it to control another robot,
p326
aVwhich is going to tickle their palm with another stick.
p327
aVAnd then we're going to ask them to rate a bunch of things
p328
aVincluding ticklishness.
p329
aa(lp330
VI'll show you just one part of our study.
p331
aVAnd here I've taken away the robots,
p332
aVbut basically people move with their right arm sinusoidally back and forward.
p333
aVAnd we replay that to the other hand with a time delay.
p334
aVEither no time delay,
p335
aVin which case light would just tickle your palm,
p336
aVor with a time delay of two-tenths of three-tenths of a second.
p337
aVSo the important point here
p338
aVis the right hand always does the same things \u2014 sinusoidal movement.
p339
aVThe left hand always is the same and puts sinusoidal tickle.
p340
aVAll we're playing with is a tempo causality.
p341
aVAnd as we go from naught to 0.1 second,
p342
aVit becomes more ticklish.
p343
aVAs you go from 0.1 to 0.2,
p344
aVit becomes more ticklish at the end.
p345
aVAnd by 0.2 of a second,
p346
aVit's equivalently ticklish
p347
aVto the robot that just tickled you without you doing anything.
p348
aVSo whatever is responsible for this cancellation
p349
aVis extremely tightly coupled with tempo causality.
p350
aVAnd based on this illustration, we really convinced ourselves in the field
p351
aVthat the brain's making precise predictions
p352
aVand subtracting them off from the sensations.
p353
aa(lp354
VNow I have to admit, these are the worst studies my lab has ever run.
p355
aVBecause the tickle sensation on the palm comes and goes,
p356
aVyou need large numbers of subjects
p357
aVwith these stars making them significant.
p358
aVSo we were looking for a much more objective way
p359
aVto assess this phenomena.
p360
aVAnd in the intervening years I had two daughters.
p361
aVAnd one thing you notice about children in backseats of cars on long journeys,
p362
aVthey get into fights \u2014
p363
aVwhich started with one of them doing something to the other, the other retaliating.
p364
aVIt quickly escalates.
p365
aVAnd children tend to get into fights which escalate in terms of force.
p366
aVNow when I screamed at my children to stop,
p367
aVsometimes they would both say to me
p368
aVthe other person hit them harder.
p369
aa(lp370
VNow I happen to know my children don't lie,
p371
aVso I thought, as a neuroscientist,
p372
aVit was important how I could explain
p373
aVhow they were telling inconsistent truths.
p374
aVAnd we hypothesize based on the tickling study
p375
aVthat when one child hits another,
p376
aVthey generate the movement command.
p377
aVThey predict the sensory consequences and subtract it off.
p378
aVSo they actually think they've hit the person less hard than they have \u2014
p379
aVrather like the tickling.
p380
aVWhereas the passive recipient
p381
aVdoesn't make the prediction, feels the full blow.
p382
aVSo if they retaliate with the same force,
p383
aVthe first person will think it's been escalated.
p384
aa(lp385
VSo we decided to test this in the lab.
p386
aV(Laughter)
p387
aVNow we don't work with children, we don't work with hitting,
p388
aVbut the concept is identical.
p389
aVWe bring in two adults. We tell them they're going to play a game.
p390
aVAnd so here's player one and player two sitting opposite to each other.
p391
aVAnd the game is very simple.
p392
aVWe started with a motor
p393
aVwith a little lever, a little force transfuser.
p394
aVAnd we use this motor to apply force down to player one's fingers
p395
aVfor three seconds and then it stops.
p396
aVAnd that player's been told, remember the experience of that force
p397
aVand use your other finger
p398
aVto apply the same force
p399
aVdown to the other subject's finger through a force transfuser \u2014 and they do that.
p400
aVAnd player two's been told, remember the experience of that force.
p401
aVUse your other hand to apply the force back down.
p402
aVAnd so they take it in turns
p403
aVto apply the force they've just experienced back and forward.
p404
aa(lp405
VBut critically,
p406
aVthey're briefed about the rules of the game in separate rooms.
p407
aVSo they don't know the rules the other person's playing by.
p408
aVAnd what we've measured
p409
aVis the force as a function of terms.
p410
aVAnd if we look at what we start with,
p411
aVa quarter of a Newton there, a number of turns,
p412
aVperfect would be that red line.
p413
aVAnd what we see in all pairs of subjects is this \u2014
p414
aVa 70 percent escalation in force
p415
aVon each go.
p416
aVSo it really suggests, when you're doing this \u2014
p417
aVbased on this study and others we've done \u2014
p418
aVthat the brain is canceling the sensory consequences
p419
aVand underestimating the force it's producing.
p420
aVSo it re-shows the brain makes predictions
p421
aVand fundamentally changes the precepts.
p422
aVSo we've made inferences, we've done predictions,
p423
aVnow we have to generate actions.
p424
aVAnd what Bayes' rule says is, given my beliefs,
p425
aVthe action should in some sense be optimal.
p426
aa(lp427
VBut we've got a problem.
p428
aVTasks are symbolic \u2014 I want to drink, I want to dance \u2014
p429
aVbut the movement system has to contract 600 muscles
p430
aVin a particular sequence.
p431
aVAnd there's a big gap
p432
aVbetween the task and the movement system.
p433
aVSo it could be bridged in infinitely many different ways.
p434
aVSo think about just a point to point movement.
p435
aVI could choose these two paths
p436
aVout of an infinite number of paths.
p437
aVHaving chosen a particular path,
p438
aVI can hold my hand on that path
p439
aVas infinitely many different joint configurations.
p440
aVAnd I can hold my arm in a particular joint configuration
p441
aVeither very stiff or very relaxed.
p442
aVSo I have a huge amount of choice to make.
p443
aVNow it turns out, we are extremely stereotypical.
p444
aVWe all move the same way pretty much.
p445
aa(lp446
VAnd so it turns out we're so stereotypical,
p447
aVour brains have got dedicated neural circuitry
p448
aVto decode this stereotyping.
p449
aVSo if I take some dots
p450
aVand set them in motion with biological motion,
p451
aVyour brain's circuitry would understand instantly what's going on.
p452
aVNow this is a bunch of dots moving.
p453
aVYou will know what this person is doing,
p454
aVwhether happy, sad, old, young \u2014 a huge amount of information.
p455
aVIf these dots were cars going on a racing circuit,
p456
aVyou would have absolutely no idea what's going on.
p457
aa(lp458
VSo why is it
p459
aVthat we move the particular ways we do?
p460
aVWell let's think about what really happens.
p461
aVMaybe we don't all quite move the same way.
p462
aVMaybe there's variation in the population.
p463
aVAnd maybe those who move better than others
p464
aVhave got more chance of getting their children into the next generation.
p465
aVSo in evolutionary scales, movements get better.
p466
aVAnd perhaps in life, movements get better through learning.
p467
aa(lp468
VSo what is it about a movement which is good or bad?
p469
aVImagine I want to intercept this ball.
p470
aVHere are two possible paths to that ball.
p471
aVWell if I choose the left-hand path,
p472
aVI can work out the forces required
p473
aVin one of my muscles as a function of time.
p474
aVBut there's noise added to this.
p475
aVSo what I actually get, based on this lovely, smooth, desired force,
p476
aVis a very noisy version.
p477
aVSo if I pick the same command through many times,
p478
aVI will get a different noisy version each time, because noise changes each time.
p479
aVSo what I can show you here
p480
aVis how the variability of the movement will evolve
p481
aVif I choose that way.
p482
aVIf I choose a different way of moving \u2014 on the right for example \u2014
p483
aVthen I'll have a different command, different noise,
p484
aVplaying through a noisy system, very complicated.
p485
aVAll we can be sure of is the variability will be different.
p486
aVIf I move in this particular way,
p487
aVI end up with a smaller variability across many movements.
p488
aVSo if I have to choose between those two,
p489
aVI would choose the right one because it's less variable.
p490
aa(lp491
VAnd the fundamental idea
p492
aVis you want to plan your movements
p493
aVso as to minimize the negative consequence of the noise.
p494
aVAnd one intuition to get
p495
aVis actually the amount of noise or variability I show here
p496
aVgets bigger as the force gets bigger.
p497
aVSo you want to avoid big forces as one principle.
p498
aVSo we've shown that using this,
p499
aVwe can explain a huge amount of data \u2014
p500
aVthat exactly people are going about their lives planning movements
p501
aVso as to minimize negative consequences of noise.
p502
aa(lp503
VSo I hope I've convinced you the brain is there
p504
aVand evolved to control movement.
p505
aVAnd it's an intellectual challenge to understand how we do that.
p506
aVBut it's also relevant
p507
aVfor disease and rehabilitation.
p508
aVThere are many diseases which effect movement.
p509
aVAnd hopefully if we understand how we control movement,
p510
aVwe can apply that to robotic technology.
p511
aVAnd finally, I want to remind you,
p512
aVwhen you see animals do what look like very simple tasks,
p513
aVthe actual complexity of what is going on inside their brain
p514
aVis really quite dramatic.
p515
aa(lp516

VChris Anderson: Quick question for you, Dan.
p521
aVSo you're a movement \u2014 (DW: Chauvinist.) \u2014 chauvinist.
p522
aVDoes that mean that you think that the other things we think our brains are about \u2014
p523
aVthe dreaming, the yearning, the falling in love and all these things \u2014
p524
aVare a kind of side show, an accident?
p525
aa(lp526
VDW: No, no, actually I think they're all important
p527
aVto drive the right movement behavior to get reproduction in the end.
p528
aVSo I think people who study sensation or memory
p529
aVwithout realizing why you're laying down memories of childhood.
p530
aVThe fact that we forget most of our childhood, for example,
p531
aVis probably fine, because it doesn't effect our movements later in life.
p532
aVYou only need to store things which are really going to effect movement.
p533
aa(lp534
VCA: So you think that people thinking about the brain, and consciousness generally,
p535
aVcould get real insight
p536
aVby saying, where does movement play in this game?
p537
aa(lp538
VDW: So people have found out for example
p539
aVthat studying vision in the absence of realizing why you have vision
p540
aVis a mistake.
p541
aVYou have to study vision with the realization
p542
aVof how the movement system is going to use vision.
p543
aVAnd it uses it very differently once you think about it that way.
p544
aa(lp545
