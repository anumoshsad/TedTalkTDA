VI'm supposed to scare you, because it's about fear, right?
p4
aVAnd you should be really afraid,
p5
aVbut not for the reasons why you think you should be.
p6
aVYou should be really afraid that \u2014
p7
aVif we stick up the first slide on this thing \u2014 there we go \u2014 that you're missing out.
p8
aVBecause if you spend this week thinking about Iraq and
p9
aVthinking about Bush and thinking about the stock market,
p10
aVyou're going to miss one of the greatest adventures that we've ever been on.
p11
aVAnd this is what this adventure's really about.
p12
aVThis is crystallized DNA.
p13
aVEvery life form on this planet \u2014 every insect, every bacteria, every plant,
p14
aVevery animal, every human, every politician \u2014 (Laughter)
p15
aVis coded in that stuff.
p16
aVAnd if you want to take a single crystal of DNA, it looks like that.
p17
aVAnd we're just beginning to understand this stuff.
p18
aVAnd this is the single most exciting adventure that we have ever been on.
p19
aVIt's the single greatest mapping project we've ever been on.
p20
aVIf you think that the mapping of America's made a difference,
p21
aVor landing on the moon, or this other stuff,
p22
aVit's the map of ourselves and the map of every plant
p23
aVand every insect and every bacteria that really makes a difference.
p24
aVAnd it's beginning to tell us a lot about evolution.
p25
aV(Laughter)
p26
aa(lp27
VIt turns out that what this stuff is \u2014
p28
aVand Richard Dawkins has written about this \u2014
p29
aVis, this is really a river out of Eden.
p30
aVSo, the 3.2 billion base pairs inside each of your cells
p31
aVis really a history of where you've been for the past billion years.
p32
aVAnd we could start dating things,
p33
aVand we could start changing medicine and archeology.
p34
aVIt turns out that if you take the human species about 700 years ago,
p35
aVwhite Europeans diverged from black Africans in a very significant way.
p36
aVWhite Europeans were subject to the plague.
p37
aVAnd when they were subject to the plague, most people didn't survive,
p38
aVbut those who survived had a mutation on the CCR5 receptor.
p39
aVAnd that mutation was passed on to their kids
p40
aVbecause they're the ones that survived,
p41
aVso there was a great deal of population pressure.
p42
aVIn Africa, because you didn't have these cities,
p43
aVyou didn't have that CCR5 population pressure mutation.
p44
aVWe can date it to 700 years ago.
p45
aVThat is one of the reasons why AIDS is raging across Africa as fast as it is,
p46
aVand not as fast across Europe.
p47
aVAnd we're beginning to find these little things for malaria,
p48
aVfor sickle cell, for cancers.
p49
aVAnd in the measure that we map ourselves,
p50
aVthis is the single greatest adventure that we'll ever be on.
p51
aVAnd this Friday, I want you to pull out a really good bottle of wine,
p52
aVand I want you to toast these two people.
p53
aVBecause this Friday, 50 years ago, Watson and Crick found the structure of DNA,
p54
aVand that is almost as important a date
p55
aVas the 12th of February when we first mapped ourselves,
p56
aVbut anyway, we'll get to that.
p57
aa(lp58
VI thought we'd talk about the new zoo.
p59
aVSo, all you guys have heard about DNA, all the stuff that DNA does,
p60
aVbut some of the stuff we're discovering is kind of nifty
p61
aVbecause this turns out to be the single most abundant species on the planet.
p62
aVIf you think you're successful or cockroaches are successful,
p63
aVit turns out that there's ten trillion trillion Pleurococcus sitting out there.
p64
aVAnd we didn't know that Pleurococcus was out there,
p65
aVwhich is part of the reason
p66
aVwhy this whole species-mapping project is so important.
p67
aVBecause we're just beginning to learn
p68
aVwhere we came from and what we are.
p69
aVAnd we're finding amoebas like this. This is the amoeba dubia.
p70
aVAnd the amoeba dubia doesn't look like much,
p71
aVexcept that each of you has about 3.2 billion letters,
p72
aVwhich is what makes you you,
p73
aVas far as gene code inside each of your cells,
p74
aVand this little amoeba which, you know,
p75
aVsits in water in hundreds and millions and billions,
p76
aVturns out to have 620 billion base pairs of gene code inside.
p77
aVSo, this little thingamajig has a genome
p78
aVthat's 200 times the size of yours.
p79
aVAnd if you're thinking of efficient information storage mechanisms,
p80
aVit may not turn out to be chips.
p81
aVIt may turn out to be something that looks a little like that amoeba.
p82
aa(lp83
VAnd, again, we're learning from life and how life works.
p84
aVThis funky little thing: people didn't used to think
p85
aVthat it was worth taking samples out of nuclear reactors
p86
aVbecause it was dangerous and, of course, nothing lived there.
p87
aVAnd then finally somebody picked up a microscope
p88
aVand looked at the water that was sitting next to the cores.
p89
aVAnd sitting next to that water in the cores
p90
aVwas this little Deinococcus radiodurans, doing a backstroke,
p91
aVhaving its chromosomes blown apart every day,
p92
aVsix, seven times, restitching them,
p93
aVliving in about 200 times the radiation that would kill you.
p94
aVAnd by now you should be getting a hint as to how diverse
p95
aVand how important and how interesting this journey into life is,
p96
aVand how many different life forms there are,
p97
aVand how there can be different life forms living in
p98
aVvery different places, maybe even outside of this planet.
p99
aVBecause if you can live in radiation that looks like this,
p100
aVthat brings up a whole series of interesting questions.
p101
aa(lp102
VThis little thingamajig: we didn't know this thingamajig existed.
p103
aVWe should have known that this existed
p104
aVbecause this is the only bacteria that you can see to the naked eye.
p105
aVSo, this thing is 0.75 millimeters.
p106
aVIt lives in a deep trench off the coast of Namibia.
p107
aVAnd what you're looking at with this namibiensis
p108
aVis the biggest bacteria we've ever seen.
p109
aVSo, it's about the size of a little period on a sentence.
p110
aVAgain, we didn't know this thing was there three years ago.
p111
aVWe're just beginning this journey of life in the new zoo.
p112
aa(lp113
VThis is a really odd one. This is Ferroplasma.
p114
aVThe reason why Ferroplasma is interesting is because it eats iron,
p115
aVlives inside the equivalent of battery acid,
p116
aVand excretes sulfuric acid.
p117
aVSo, when you think of odd life forms,
p118
aVwhen you think of what it takes to live,
p119
aVit turns out this is a very efficient life form,
p120
aVand they call it an archaea. Archaea means "the ancient ones."
p121
aVAnd the reason why they're ancient is because this thing came up
p122
aVwhen this planet was covered
p123
aVby things like sulfuric acid in batteries,
p124
aVand it was eating iron when the earth was part of a melted core.
p125
aVSo, it's not just dogs and cats and whales and dolphins
p126
aVthat you should be aware of and interested in on this little journey.
p127
aa(lp128
VYour fear should be that you are not,
p129
aVthat you're paying attention to stuff which is temporal.
p130
aVI mean, George Bush \u2014 he's going to be gone, alright? Life isn't.
p131
aVWhether the humans survive or don't survive,
p132
aVthese things are going to be living on this planet or other planets.
p133
aVAnd it's just beginning to understand this code of DNA
p134
aVthat's really the most exciting intellectual adventure
p135
aVthat we've ever been on.
p136
aa(lp137
VAnd you can do strange things with this stuff. This is a baby gaur.
p138
aVConservation group gets together,
p139
aVtries to figure out how to breed an animal that's almost extinct.
p140
aVThey can't do it naturally, so what they do with this thing is
p141
aVthey take a spoon, take some cells out of an adult gaur's mouth, code,
p142
aVtake the cells from that and insert it into a fertilized cow's egg,
p143
aVreprogram cow's egg \u2014 different gene code.
p144
aVWhen you do that, the cow gives birth to a gaur.
p145
aVWe are now experimenting with bongos, pandas, elands, Sumatran tigers,
p146
aVand the Australians \u2014 bless their hearts \u2014
p147
aVare playing with these things.
p148
aa(lp149
VNow, the last of these things died in September 1936.
p150
aVThese are Tasmanian tigers. The last known one died at the Hobart Zoo.
p151
aVBut it turns out that as we learn more about gene code
p152
aVand how to reprogram species,
p153
aVwe may be able to close the gene gaps in deteriorate DNA.
p154
aVAnd when we learn how to close the gene gaps,
p155
aVthen we can put a full string of DNA together.
p156
aVAnd if we do that, and insert this into a fertilized wolf's egg,
p157
aVwe may give birth to an animal
p158
aVthat hasn't walked the earth since 1936.
p159
aVAnd then you can start going back further,
p160
aVand you can start thinking about dodos,
p161
aVand you can think about other species.
p162
aVAnd in other places, like Maryland, they're trying to figure out
p163
aVwhat the primordial ancestor is.
p164
aVBecause each of us contains our entire gene code
p165
aVof where we've been for the past billion years,
p166
aVbecause we've evolved from that stuff,
p167
aVyou can take that tree of life and collapse it back,
p168
aVand in the measure that you learn to reprogram,
p169
aVmaybe we'll give birth to something
p170
aVthat is very close to the first primordial ooze.
p171
aVAnd it's all coming out of things that look like this.
p172
aa(lp173
VThese are companies that didn't exist five years ago.
p174
aVHuge gene sequencing facilities the size of football fields.
p175
aVSome are public. Some are private.
p176
aVIt takes about 5 billion dollars to sequence a human being the first time.
p177
aVTakes about 3 million dollars the second time.
p178
aVWe will have a 1,000-dollar genome within the next five to eight years.
p179
aVThat means each of you will contain on a CD your entire gene code.
p180
aVAnd it will be really boring. It will read like this.
p181
aV(Laughter)
p182
aVThe really neat thing about this stuff is that's life.
p183
aVAnd Laurie's going to talk about this one a little bit.
p184
aVBecause if you happen to find this one inside your body,
p185
aVyou're in big trouble, because that's the source code for Ebola.
p186
aVThat's one of the deadliest diseases known to humans.
p187
aVBut plants work the same way and insects work the same way,
p188
aVand this apple works the same way.
p189
aVThis apple is the same thing as this floppy disk.
p190
aVBecause this thing codes ones and zeros,
p191
aVand this thing codes A, T, C, Gs, and it sits up there,
p192
aVabsorbing energy on a tree, and one fine day
p193
aVit has enough energy to say, execute, and it goes [thump]. Right?
p194
aV(Laughter)
p195
aVAnd when it does that, pushes a .EXE, what it does is,
p196
aVit executes the first line of code, which reads just like that,
p197
aVAATCAGGGACCC, and that means: make a root.
p198
aVNext line of code: make a stem.
p199
aVNext line of code, TACGGGG: make a flower that's white,
p200
aVthat blooms in the spring, that smells like this.
p201
aVIn the measure that you have the code
p202
aVand the measure that you read it \u2014
p203
aVand, by the way, the first plant was read two years ago;
p204
aVthe first human was read two years ago;
p205
aVthe first insect was read two years ago.
p206
aa(lp207
VThe first thing that we ever read was in 1995:
p208
aVa little bacteria called Haemophilus influenzae.
p209
aVIn the measure that you have the source code, as all of you know,
p210
aVyou can change the source code, and you can reprogram life forms
p211
aVso that this little thingy becomes a vaccine,
p212
aVor this little thingy starts producing biomaterials,
p213
aVwhich is why DuPont is now growing a form of polyester
p214
aVthat feels like silk in corn.
p215
aVThis changes all rules. This is life, but we're reprogramming it.
p216
aVThis is what you look like. This is one of your chromosomes.
p217
aVAnd what you can do now is,
p218
aVyou can outlay exactly what your chromosome is,
p219
aVand what the gene code on that chromosome is right here,
p220
aVand what those genes code for, and what animals they code against,
p221
aVand then you can tie it to the literature.
p222
aVAnd in the measure that you can do that, you can go home today,
p223
aVand get on the Internet, and access
p224
aVthe world's biggest public library, which is a library of life.
p225
aVAnd you can do some pretty strange things
p226
aVbecause in the same way as you can reprogram this apple,
p227
aVif you go to Cliff Tabin's lab at the Harvard Medical School,
p228
aVhe's reprogramming chicken embryos to grow more wings.
p229
aVWhy would Cliff be doing that? He doesn't have a restaurant.
p230
aV(Laughter)
p231
aa(lp232
VThe reason why he's reprogramming that animal to have more wings
p233
aVis because when you used to play with lizards as a little child,
p234
aVand you picked up the lizard, sometimes the tail fell off, but it regrew.
p235
aVNot so in human beings:
p236
aVyou cut off an arm, you cut off a leg \u2014 it doesn't regrow.
p237
aVBut because each of your cells contains your entire gene code,
p238
aVeach cell can be reprogrammed, if we don't stop stem cell research
p239
aVand if we don't stop genomic research,
p240
aVto express different body functions.
p241
aVAnd in the measure that we learn how chickens grow wings,
p242
aVand what the program is for those cells to differentiate,
p243
aVone of the things we're going to be able to do
p244
aVis to stop undifferentiated cells, which you know as cancer,
p245
aVand one of the things we're going to learn how to do
p246
aVis how to reprogram cells like stem cells
p247
aVin such a way that they express bone, stomach, skin, pancreas.
p248
aVAnd you are likely to be wandering around \u2014 and your children \u2014
p249
aVon regrown body parts in a reasonable period of time,
p250
aVin some places in the world where they don't stop the research.
p251
aa(lp252
VHow's this stuff work? If each of you differs
p253
aVfrom the person next to you by one in a thousand, but only three percent codes,
p254
aVwhich means it's only one in a thousand times three percent,
p255
aVvery small differences in expression and punctuation
p256
aVcan make a significant difference. Take a simple declarative sentence.
p257
aV(Laughter)
p258
aVRight?
p259
aVThat's perfectly clear. So, men read that sentence,
p260
aVand they look at that sentence, and they read this.
p261
aVOkay?
p262
aVNow, women look at that sentence and they say, uh-uh, wrong.
p263
aVThis is the way it should be seen.
p264
aV(Laughter)
p265
aVThat's what your genes are doing.
p266
aVThat's why you differ from this person over here by one in a thousand.
p267
aVRight? But, you know, he's reasonably good looking, but...
p268
aVI won't go there.
p269
aVYou can do this stuff even without changing the punctuation.
p270
aVYou can look at this, right?
p271
aVAnd they look at the world a little differently.
p272
aVThey look at the same world and they say...
p273
aV(Laughter)
p274
aVThat's how the same gene code \u2014 that's why you have 30,000 genes,
p275
aVmice have 30,000 genes, husbands have 30,000 genes.
p276
aVMice and men are the same. Wives know that, but anyway.
p277
aVYou can make very small changes in gene code
p278
aVand get really different outcomes,
p279
aVeven with the same string of letters.
p280
aVThat's what your genes are doing every day.
p281
aVThat's why sometimes a person's genes
p282
aVdon't have to change a lot to get cancer.
p283
aa(lp284
VThese little chippies, these things are the size of a credit card.
p285
aVThey will test any one of you for 60,000 genetic conditions.
p286
aVThat brings up questions of privacy and insurability
p287
aVand all kinds of stuff, but it also allows us to start going after diseases,
p288
aVbecause if you run a person who has leukemia through something like this,
p289
aVit turns out that three diseases with
p290
aVcompletely similar clinical syndromes
p291
aVare completely different diseases.
p292
aVBecause in ALL leukemia, that set of genes over there over-expresses.
p293
aVIn MLL, it's the middle set of genes,
p294
aVand in AML, it's the bottom set of genes.
p295
aVAnd if one of those particular things is expressing in your body,
p296
aVthen you take Gleevec and you're cured.
p297
aVIf it is not expressing in your body,
p298
aVif you don't have one of those types \u2014
p299
aVa particular one of those types \u2014 don't take Gleevec.
p300
aVIt won't do anything for you.
p301
aVSame thing with Receptin if you've got breast cancer.
p302
aVDon't have an HER-2 receptor? Don't take Receptin.
p303
aVChanges the nature of medicine. Changes the predictions of medicine.
p304
aVChanges the way medicine works.
p305
aa(lp306
VThe greatest repository of knowledge when most of us went to college
p307
aVwas this thing, and it turns out that
p308
aVthis is not so important any more.
p309
aVThe U.S. Library of Congress, in terms of its printed volume of data,
p310
aVcontains less data than is coming out of a good genomics company
p311
aVevery month on a compound basis.
p312
aVLet me say that again: A single genomics company
p313
aVgenerates more data in a month, on a compound basis,
p314
aVthan is in the printed collections of the Library of Congress.
p315
aVThis is what's been powering the U.S. economy. It's Moore's Law.
p316
aVSo, all of you know that the price of computers halves every 18 months
p317
aVand the power doubles, right?
p318
aVExcept that when you lay that side by side with the speed
p319
aVwith which gene data's being deposited in GenBank,
p320
aVMoore's Law is right here: it's the blue line.
p321
aVThis is on a log scale, and that's what superexponential growth means.
p322
aVThis is going to push computers to have to grow faster
p323
aVthan they've been growing, because so far,
p324
aVthere haven't been applications that have been required
p325
aVthat need to go faster than Moore's Law. This stuff does.
p326
aa(lp327
VAnd here's an interesting map.
p328
aVThis is a map which was finished at the Harvard Business School.
p329
aVOne of the really interesting questions is, if all this data's free,
p330
aVwho's using it? This is the greatest public library in the world.
p331
aVWell, it turns out that there's about 27 trillion bits
p332
aVmoving inside from the United States to the United States;
p333
aVabout 4.6 trillion is going over to those European countries;
p334
aVabout 5.5's going to Japan; there's almost no communication
p335
aVbetween Japan, and nobody else is literate in this stuff.
p336
aVIt's free. No one's reading it. They're focusing on the war;
p337
aVthey're focusing on Bush; they're not interested in life.
p338
aVSo, this is what a new map of the world looks like.
p339
aVThat is the genomically literate world. And that is a problem.
p340
aVIn fact, it's not a genomically literate world.
p341
aVYou can break this out by states.
p342
aVAnd you can watch states rise and fall depending on
p343
aVtheir ability to speak a language of life,
p344
aVand you can watch New York fall off a cliff,
p345
aVand you can watch New Jersey fall off a cliff,
p346
aVand you can watch the rise of the new empires of intelligence.
p347
aVAnd you can break it out by counties, because it's specific counties.
p348
aVAnd if you want to get more specific,
p349
aVit's actually specific zip codes.
p350
aV(Laughter)
p351
aa(lp352
VSo, you want to know where life is happening?
p353
aVWell, in Southern California it's happening in 92121. And that's it.
p354
aVAnd that's the triangle between Salk, Scripps, UCSD,
p355
aVand it's called Torrey Pines Road.
p356
aVThat means you don't need to be a big nation to be successful;
p357
aVit means you don't need a lot of people to be successful;
p358
aVand it means you can move most of the wealth of a country
p359
aVin about three or four carefully picked 747s.
p360
aa(lp361
VSame thing in Massachusetts. Looks more spread out but \u2014
p362
aVoh, by the way, the ones that are the same color are contiguous.
p363
aVWhat's the net effect of this?
p364
aVIn an agricultural society, the difference between
p365
aVthe richest and the poorest,
p366
aVthe most productive and the least productive, was five to one. Why?
p367
aVBecause in agriculture, if you had 10 kids
p368
aVand you grow up a little bit earlier and you work a little bit harder,
p369
aVyou could produce about five times more wealth, on average,
p370
aVthan your neighbor.
p371
aVIn a knowledge society, that number is now 427 to 1.
p372
aVIt really matters if you're literate, not just in reading and writing
p373
aVin English and French and German,
p374
aVbut in Microsoft and Linux and Apple.
p375
aVAnd very soon it's going to matter if you're literate in life code.
p376
aVSo, if there is something you should fear,
p377
aVit's that you're not keeping your eye on the ball.
p378
aVBecause it really matters who speaks life.
p379
aVThat's why nations rise and fall.
p380
aa(lp381
VAnd it turns out that if you went back to the 1870s,
p382
aVthe most productive nation on earth was Australia, per person.
p383
aVAnd New Zealand was way up there. And then the U.S. came in about 1950,
p384
aVand then Switzerland about 1973, and then the U.S. got back on top \u2014
p385
aVbeat up their chocolates and cuckoo clocks.
p386
aVAnd today, of course, you all know that the most productive nation
p387
aVon earth is Luxembourg, producing about one third more wealth
p388
aVper person per year than America.
p389
aVTiny landlocked state. No oil. No diamonds. No natural resources.
p390
aVJust smart people moving bits. Different rules.

aa(lp392
VHere's differential productivity rates.
p393
aVHere's how many people it takes to produce a single U.S. patent.
p394
aVSo, about 3,000 Americans, 6,000 Koreans, 14,000 Brits,
p395
aV790,000 Argentines. You want to know why Argentina's crashing?
p396
aVIt's got nothing to do with inflation.
p397
aVIt's got nothing to do with privatization.
p398
aVYou can take a Harvard-educated Ivy League economist,
p399
aVstick him in charge of Argentina. He still crashes the country
p400
aVbecause he doesn't understand how the rules have changed.
p401
aVOh, yeah, and it takes about 5.6 million Indians.
p402
aVWell, watch what happens to India.
p403
aVIndia and China used to be 40 percent of the global economy
p404
aVjust at the Industrial Revolution, and they are now about 4.8 percent.
p405
aVTwo billion people. One third of the global population producing 5 percent of the wealth
p406
aVbecause they didn't get this change,
p407
aVbecause they kept treating their people like serfs
p408
aVinstead of like shareholders of a common project.
p409
aVThey didn't keep the people who were educated.
p410
aVThey didn't foment the businesses. They didn't do the IPOs.
p411
aVSilicon Valley did. And that's why they say
p412
aVthat Silicon Valley has been powered by ICs.
p413
aVNot integrated circuits: Indians and Chinese.

VHere's what's happening in the world.
p417
aVIt turns out that if you'd gone to the U.N. in 1950,
p418
aVwhen it was founded, there were 50 countries in this world.
p419
aVIt turns out there's now about 192.
p420
aVCountry after country is splitting, seceding, succeeding, failing \u2014
p421
aVand it's all getting very fragmented. And this has not stopped.
p422
aVIn the 1990s, these are sovereign states
p423
aVthat did not exist before 1990.
p424
aVAnd this doesn't include fusions or name changes or changes in flags.
p425
aVWe're generating about 3.12 states per year.
p426
aVPeople are taking control of their own states,
p427
aVsometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse.
p428
aVAnd the really interesting thing is,
p429
aVyou and your kids are empowered to build great empires,
p430
aVand you don't need a lot to do it.
p431
aV(Music)
p432
aVAnd, given that the music is over, I was going to talk
p433
aVabout how you can use this to generate a lot of wealth,
p434
aVand how code works.

aVJuan Enriquez: No, I'm going to stop there and we'll do it next year
