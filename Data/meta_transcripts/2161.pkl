VI'm a tourism entrepreneur and a peacebuilder,
p4
aVbut this is not how I started.
p5
aVWhen I was seven years old, I remember watching television
p6
aVand seeing people throwing rocks,
p7
aVand thinking, this must be a fun thing to do.
p8
aVSo I got out to the street and threw rocks,
p9
aVnot realizing I was supposed to throw rocks at Israeli cars.
p10
aVInstead, I ended up stoning my neighbors' cars. (Laughter)
p11
aVThey were not enthusiastic about my patriotism.
p12
aa(lp13
VThis is my picture with my brother.
p14
aVThis is me, the little one, and I know what you're thinking:
p15
aV"You used to look cute, what the heck happened to you?"
p16
aVBut my brother, who is older than me,
p17
aVwas arrested when he was 18,
p18
aVtaken to prison on charges of throwing stones.
p19
aVHe was beaten up when he refused to confess that he threw stones,
p20
aVand as a result, had internal injuries
p21
aVthat caused his death soon after he was released from prison.
p22
aa(lp23
VI was angry, I was bitter,
p24
aVand all I wanted was revenge.
p25
aa(lp26
VBut that changed when I was 18.
p27
aVI decided that I needed Hebrew to get a job,
p28
aVand going to study Hebrew in that classroom
p29
aVwas the first time I ever met Jews who were not soldiers.
p30
aVAnd we connected over really small things, like the fact that I love country music,
p31
aVwhich is really strange for Palestinians.
p32
aVBut it was then that I realized also that we have a wall of anger,
p33
aVof hatred and of ignorance that separates us.
p34
aVI decided that it doesn't matter what happens to me.
p35
aVWhat really matters is how I deal with it.
p36
aVAnd therefore, I decided to dedicate my life
p37
aVto bringing down the walls that separate people.
p38
aa(lp39
VI do so through many ways.
p40
aVTourism is one of them, but also media and education,
p41
aVand you might be wondering, really, can tourism change things?
p42
aVCan it bring down walls? Yes.
p43
aVTourism is the best sustainable way to bring down those walls
p44
aVand to create a sustainable way of connecting with each other
p45
aVand creating friendships.
p46
aa(lp47
VIn 2009, I cofounded Mejdi Tours,
p48
aVa social enterprise that aims to connect people,
p49
aVwith two Jewish friends, by the way,
p50
aVand what we'll do, the model we did,
p51
aVfor example, in Jerusalem, we would have two tour guides,
p52
aVone Israeli and one Palestinian, guiding the trips together,
p53
aVtelling history and narrative and archaeology and conflict
p54
aVfrom totally different perspectives.
p55
aVI remember running a trip together with a friend named Kobi \u2014
p56
aVJewish congregation from Chicago, the trip was in Jerusalem \u2014
p57
aVand we took them to a refugee camp, a Palestinian refugee camp,
p58
aVand there we had this amazing food.
p59
aVBy the way, this is my mother. She's cool.
p60
aVAnd that's the Palestinian food called maqluba.
p61
aVIt means "upside-down."
p62
aVYou cook it with rice and chicken, and you flip it upside-down.
p63
aVIt's the best meal ever.
p64
aVAnd we'll eat together.
p65
aVThen we had a joint band, Israeli and Palestinian musicians,
p66
aVand we did some belly-dancing.
p67
aVIf you don't know any, I'll teach you later.
p68
aVBut when we left, both sides,
p69
aVthey were crying because they did not want to leave.
p70
aVThree years later, those relationships still exist.
p71
aa(lp72
VImagine with me if the one billion people
p73
aVwho travel internationally  every year travel like this,
p74
aVnot being taken in the bus from one side to another,
p75
aVfrom one hotel to another,
p76
aVtaking pictures from the windows of their buses of people and cultures,
p77
aVbut actually connecting with people.
p78
aa(lp79
VYou know, I remember having a Muslim group from the U.K.
p80
aVgoing to the house of an Orthodox Jewish family,
p81
aVand having their first Friday night dinners, that Sabbath dinner,
p82
aVand eating together hamin, which is a Jewish food, a stew,
p83
aVjust having the connection of realizing, after a while,
p84
aVthat a hundred years ago, their families came out
p85
aVof the same place in Northern Africa.
p86
aVThis is not a photo profile for your Facebook.
p87
aVThis is not disaster tourism.
p88
aVThis is the future of travel,
p89
aVand I invite you to join me to do that, to change your travel.
p90
aVWe're doing it all over the world now,
p91
aVfrom Ireland to Iran to Turkey,
p92
aVand we see ourselves going everywhere to change the world.
p93
aa(lp94
VThank you.
