VDo you think it's possible to control someone's attention?
p4
aVEven more than that, what about predicting human behavior?
p5
aVI think those are interesting ideas.
p6
aVFor me, that would be the perfect superpower,
p7
aVactually kind of an evil way of approaching it.
p8
aVBut for myself, in the past, I've spent the last 20 years
p9
aVstudying human behavior from a rather unorthodox way:
p10
aVpicking pockets.
p11
aVWhen we think of misdirection,
p12
aVwe think of something as looking off to the side,
p13
aVwhen actually the things right in front of us
p14
aVare often the hardest to see,
p15
aVthe things that you look at every day that you're blinded to.
p16
aa(lp17
VFor example, how many of you still have your cell phones on you right now?
p18
aVGreat. Double-check.
p19
aVMake sure you still have them.
p20
aVI was doing some shopping before.
p21
aa(lp22
V(Laughter)
p23
aa(lp24
VYou've looked at them a few times today,
p25
aVbut I'll ask you a question.
p26
aVWithout looking at it directly yet,
p27
aVcan you remember the icon in the bottom right corner?
p28
aVBring them out, check and see how accurate you were.
p29
aVHow'd you do?
p30
aVShow of hands. Did we get it?
p31
aa(lp32
VNow that you're done, close them down.
p33
aVEvery phone has something in common.
p34
aVNo matter how you organize the icons,
p35
aVyou still have a clock on the front.
p36
aVSo, without looking at your phone, what time was it?
p37
aVYou just looked at your clock, right?
p38
aVInteresting idea.
p39
aVLet's take that a step further with a game of trust.
p40
aVClose your eyes.
p41
aVI realize I'm asking you to do that while you just heard
p42
aVthere's a pickpocket in the room, but close your eyes.
p43
aa(lp44
VNow, you've been watching me for about 30 seconds.
p45
aVWith your eyes closed, what am I wearing?
p46
aVMake your best guess.
p47
aVWhat color is my shirt? What color is my tie?
p48
aVNow open your eyes.
p49
aVShow of hands, were you right?
p50
aVInteresting, isn't it?
p51
aa(lp52
VSome of us are a little bit more perceptive than others, it seems.
p53
aVBut I have a different theory about that model of attention.
p54
aVThey have fancy models of attention, Posner's trinity model of attention.
p55
aVFor me, I like to think of it very simple, like a surveillance system.
p56
aVIt's kind of like you have all these fancy sensors,
p57
aVand inside your brain is a little security guard.
p58
aVFor me, I like to call him Frank.
p59
aVSo Frank is sitting at a desk.
p60
aVHe's got lots of cool information in front of him,
p61
aVhigh-tech equipment, he's got cameras,
p62
aVhe's got a little phone that he can pick up, listen to the ears,
p63
aVall these senses, all these perceptions.
p64
aVBut attention is what steers your perceptions,
p65
aVit's what controls your reality.
p66
aVIt's the gateway to the mind.
p67
aVIf you don't attend to something, you can't be aware of it.
p68
aVBut ironically, you can attend to something without being aware of it.
p69
aVFor example, the cocktail effect:
p70
aVYou're in a party, having conversations with someone,
p71
aVand yet you can recognize your name
p72
aVwithout realizing you were listening to that.
p73
aa(lp74
VNow, for my job, I have to play with techniques to exploit this,
p75
aVto play with your attention as a limited resource.
p76
aVSo if I could control how you spend your attention,
p77
aVif I could maybe steal your attention through a distraction.
p78
aVNow, instead of doing it like misdirection
p79
aVand throwing it off to the side,
p80
aVinstead, what I choose to focus on is Frank,
p81
aVto be able to play with the Frank inside your head,
p82
aVyour security guard,
p83
aVand get you, instead of focusing on your external senses,
p84
aVjust to go internal for a second.
p85
aa(lp86
VSo if I ask you to access a memory, like, what is that?
p87
aVWhat just happened? Do you have a wallet?
p88
aVDo you have an American Express in your wallet?
p89
aVAnd when I do that, your Frank turns around.
p90
aVHe accesses the file. He has to rewind the tape.
p91
aVWhat's interesting is, he can't rewind the tape
p92
aVat the same time that he's trying to process new data.
p93
aa(lp94
VThis sounds like a good theory,
p95
aVbut I could talk for a long time, tell you lots of things,
p96
aVand a portion of them may be true,
p97
aVbut I think it's better if I tried to show that to you here live.
p98
aVIf I come down, I'm going to do a bit of shopping.
p99
aVJust hold still where you are.
p100
aa(lp101
VHello, how are you? It's lovely to see you.
p102
aVWonderful job onstage.
p103
aVLovely watch, it doesn't come off very well.
p104
aVDo you have a ring as well?
p105
aVGood. Just taking inventory. You're like a buffet.
p106
aVHard to tell where to start, so many great things.
p107
aa(lp108
VHi, how are you? Good to see you.
p109
aa(lp110
VHi, sir, could you stand up, please? Just right where you are.
p111
aVYou're married, you follow directions well.
p112
aVNice to meet you, sir.
p113
aVYou don't have a lot in your pockets. Anything down here?
p114
aVHopefully so. Have a seat. There you go. You're doing well.
p115
aa(lp116
VHi, sir, how are you?
p117
aVGood to see you, sir. You have a ring, a watch.
p118
aVDo you have a wallet on you? Joe: I don't.
p119
aa(lp120
VAR: Well, we'll find one for you. Come on up this way, Joe.
p121
aVGive Joe a round of applause. Come on up, Joe. Let's play a game.
p122
aa(lp123
V(Applause)
p124
aa(lp125
VAR: Pardon me.
p126
aVI don't think I need this clicker anymore.
p127
aVThank you very much. I appreciate that.
p128
aVCome on up to the stage, Joe. Let's play a little game now.
p129
aVAnything in your front pockets?
p130
aa(lp131
VJ: Money.
p132
aa(lp133
VAR: Money! All right, let's try that.
p134
aVCan you stand right over this way for me?
p135
aVTurn around and, let's see,
p136
aVif I give you something that belongs to me,
p137
aVthis is just something I have,
p138
aVa poker chip.
p139
aVHold out your hand for me.
p140
aVWatch it closely.
p141
aVThis is a task for you to focus on.
p142
aVYou have your money in your front pocket?
p143
aa(lp144
VJ: Yup. AR: Good.
p145
aa(lp146
VI won't put my hand in your pocket. I'm not ready for that kind of commitment.
p147
aVOnce a guy had a hole in his pocket,
p148
aVand that was rather traumatizing for me.
p149
aVI wanted his wallet, he gave me his number.
p150
aVBig miscommunication.
p151
aa(lp152
V(Laughter)
p153
aa(lp154
VLet's do this simply. Squeeze your hand tight.
p155
aVDo you feel the poker chip in your hand?
p156
aa(lp157
VJ: I do.
p158
aa(lp159
VAR: Would you be surprised if I took it? Say yes.
p160
aa(lp161
VJ: Very. AR: Good.
p162
aa(lp163
VOpen your hand. Thank you very much.
p164
aVI'll cheat if you give me a chance.
p165
aVMake it harder for me. Just use your hand.
p166
aVGrab my wrist, but squeeze, squeeze firm.
p167
aVDid you see it go? Joe: No.
p168
aa(lp169
VAR: No, it's not here. Open your hand.
p170
aVWhile we're focused on the hand, it's sitting on your shoulder.
p171
aVGo ahead and take it off.
p172
aVNow, let's try that again.
p173
aVHold your hand out flat. Open it up.
p174
aVPut your hand up a little bit higher, but watch it close.
p175
aVIf I did it slowly, it'd be on your shoulder.
p176
aa(lp177
V(Laughter)
p178
aa(lp179
VJoe, we're going to keep doing this till you catch it.
p180
aVYou'll get it eventually. I have faith in you.
p181
aVSqueeze firm. You're human, you're not slow.
p182
aVIt's back on your shoulder.
p183
aVYou were focused on your hand, distracted.
p184
aVWhile you were watching, I couldn't get your watch off.
p185
aVYet you had something inside your pocket.
p186
aVDo you remember what it was?
p187
aa(lp188
VJ: Money.
p189
aa(lp190
VAR: Check your pocket. Is it still there?
p191
aa(lp192
V(Laughter)
p193
aa(lp194
VOh, there it was. Put it away.
p195
aVWe're just shopping.
p196
aVThis trick's more about the timing.
p197
aVI'm going to try to push it inside your hand.
p198
aVPut your other hand on top, would you?
p199
aVIt's amazingly obvious now, isn't it?
p200
aVLooks a lot like the watch I was wearing, doesn't it?
p201
aa(lp202
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p203
aa(lp204
VJ: That's pretty good. AR: Oh, thanks.
p205
aa(lp206
V(Applause)
p207
aa(lp208
VBut it's only a start. Let's try it a little bit differently.
p209
aVHold your hands together. Your other hand on top.
p210
aVIf you're watching this little token,
p211
aVthis obviously has become a little target, like a red herring.
p212
aVIf we watch this kind of close, it looks like it goes away.
p213
aVIt's not back on your shoulder.
p214
aVIt falls out of the air, lands right back in the hand.
p215
aVDid you see it go?
p216
aVYeah, funny. We've got a little guy. He's union, works up there all day.
p217
aVIf I do it slowly it goes straight away, it lands by your pocket.
p218
aVIs it in this pocket, sir?
p219
aVDon't reach in your pocket. That's a different show.
p220
aa(lp221
V(Squeaking)
p222
aa(lp223
VThat's rather strange. They have shots for that.
p224
aVCan I show them? Rather bizarre. Is this yours, sir?
p225
aVI have no idea how that works. We'll send that over there.
p226
aa(lp227
VI need help with this one.
p228
aVStep over this way for me.
p229
aVDon't run away. You had something down by your pants pocket.
p230
aVI was checking mine. I couldn't find everything,
p231
aVbut I noticed you had something here.
p232
aVCan I feel the outside for a moment?
p233
aVDown here I noticed this. Is this something of yours, sir?
p234
aVI have no idea. That's a shrimp.
p235
aa(lp236
VJ: Yeah. I'm saving it for later.
p237
aa(lp238
VAR: You've entertained all of these people in a wonderful way,
p239
aVbetter than you know.
p240
aVSo we'd love to give you this lovely watch as a gift.
p241
aa(lp242
V(Laughter)
p243
aa(lp244
VHopefully it matches his taste.
p245
aVWe have a couple of other things,
p246
aVa little bit of cash.
p247
aVAnd we have a few other things,
p248
aVthese all belong to you,
p249
aValong with a big round of applause from all your friends.
p250
aa(lp251
V(Applause)
p252
aa(lp253
VJoe, thank you very much.
p254
aa(lp255
V(Applause)
p256
aa(lp257
V(Applause ends)
p258
aa(lp259
VSo, same question I asked you before,
p260
aVbut this time you don't have to close your eyes.
p261
aVWhat am I wearing?
p262
aa(lp263
VAudience: Oh!
p264
aa(lp265
V(Laughter)
p266
aa(lp267
V(Hesitant applause)
p268
aa(lp269
V(Applause ends)
p270
aa(lp271
VAttention is a powerful thing.
p272
aVLike I said, it shapes your reality.
p273
aVSo, I guess I'd like to pose that question to you.
p274
aVIf you could control somebody's attention,
p275
aVwhat would you do with it?
p276
aa(lp277
VThank you.
