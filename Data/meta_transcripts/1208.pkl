VFor as long as I can remember,
p4
aVI have felt a very deep connection to animals and to the ocean.
p5
aVAnd at this age, my personal idol was Flipper the dolphin.
p6
aVAnd when I first learned about endangered species,
p7
aVI was truly distressed to know that every day,
p8
aVanimals were being wiped off the face of this Earth forever.
p9
aVAnd I wanted to do something to help, but I always wondered:
p10
aVWhat could one person possibly do to make a difference?
p11
aVAnd it would be 30 years,
p12
aVbut I would eventually get the answer to that question.
p13
aa(lp14
VWhen these heartbreaking images of oiled birds
p15
aVfinally began to emerge from the Gulf of Mexico last year
p16
aVduring the horrific BP oil spill,
p17
aVa German biologist by the name of Silvia Gaus was quoted as saying,
p18
aV"We should just euthanize all oiled birds,
p19
aVbecause studies have shown
p20
aVthat fewer than one percent of them survive after being released."
p21
aVAnd I could not disagree more.
p22
aVIn addition,
p23
aVI believe that every oiled animal deserves a second chance at life.
p24
aVAnd I want to tell you why I feel so strongly about this.
p25
aa(lp26
VOn June 23, 2000,
p27
aVa ship named the Treasure sank off the coast of Cape Town, South Africa,
p28
aVspilling 1,300 tons of fuel,
p29
aVwhich polluted the habitats of nearly half the entire world population
p30
aVof African penguins.
p31
aVNow, the ship sank between Robben Island to the south,
p32
aVand Dassen Island to the north \u2014
p33
aVtwo of the penguins' main breeding islands.
p34
aVAnd exactly six years and three days earlier,
p35
aVon June 20, 1994,
p36
aVa ship named the Apollo Sea sank near Dassen Island,
p37
aVoiling 10,000 penguins, half of which died.
p38
aa(lp39
VNow when the Treasure sank in 2000,
p40
aVit was the height of the best breeding season
p41
aVscientists had ever recorded for the African penguin,
p42
aVwhich at the time, was listed as a threatened species.
p43
aVAnd soon, nearly 20,000 penguins
p44
aVwere covered with this toxic oil.
p45
aVThe local seabird rescue center, named SANCCOB,
p46
aVimmediately launched a massive rescue operation,
p47
aVand this soon would become the largest animal rescue ever undertaken.
p48
aa(lp49
VAt the time, I was working down the street.
p50
aVI was a penguin aquarist at the New England Aquarium.
p51
aVAnd exactly 11 years ago yesterday,
p52
aVthe phone rang in the penguin office.
p53
aVAnd with that call, my life would change forever.
p54
aVIt was Estelle van Der Merwe calling from SANCCOB,
p55
aVsaying, "Please come help.
p56
aVWe have thousands of oiled penguins
p57
aVand thousands of willing but completely inexperienced volunteers.
p58
aVAnd we need penguin experts to come train and supervise them."
p59
aVSo two days later,
p60
aVI was on a plane headed for Cape Town
p61
aVwith a team of penguin specialists.
p62
aa(lp63
VAnd the scene inside of this building was devastating and surreal.
p64
aVIn fact, many people compared it to a war zone.
p65
aVLast week, a 10-year-old girl asked me:
p66
aV"What did it feel like when you first walked into that building
p67
aVand saw so many oiled penguins?"
p68
aVAnd this is what happened.
p69
aVI was instantly transported back to that moment in time.
p70
aVPenguins are very vocal birds and really, really noisy,
p71
aVso I expected to walk into this building
p72
aVand be met with this cacophony of honking and braying and squawking.
p73
aVBut instead,
p74
aVwhen we stepped through those doors and into the building,
p75
aVit was eerily silent.
p76
aVSo it was very clear
p77
aVthese were stressed, sick, traumatized birds.
p78
aa(lp79
VThe other thing that was so striking
p80
aVwas the sheer number of volunteers.
p81
aVUp to 1,000 people a day came to the rescue center.
p82
aVEventually, over the course of this rescue,
p83
aVmore than 12-and-a-half thousand volunteers
p84
aVcame from all over the world to Cape Town,
p85
aVto help save these birds.
p86
aVAnd the amazing thing was that not one of them had to be there.
p87
aVYet they were.
p88
aVSo for the few of us that were there in a professional capacity,
p89
aVthis extraordinary volunteer response to this animal crisis
p90
aVwas profoundly moving and awe-inspiring.
p91
aa(lp92
VSo the day after we arrived,
p93
aVtwo of us from the aquarium were put in charge of room two.
p94
aVRoom two had more than 4,000 oiled penguins in it.
p95
aVNow, mind you \u2014
p96
aVthree days earlier, we had 60 penguins under our care,
p97
aVso we were definitely overwhelmed
p98
aVand just a bit terrified \u2014 at least I was.
p99
aVPersonally, I really didn't know
p100
aVif I was capable of handling such a monstrous task.
p101
aVAnd collectively,
p102
aVwe really didn't know if we could pull this off.
p103
aVBecause we all knew that just six years earlier,
p104
aVhalf as many penguins had been oiled and rescued,
p105
aVand only half of them had survived.
p106
aVSo would it be humanly possible to save this many oiled penguins?
p107
aVWe just did not know.
p108
aa(lp109
VBut what gave us hope
p110
aVwere these incredibly dedicated and brave volunteers,
p111
aVthree of whom here are force-feeding penguins.
p112
aVYou may notice they're wearing very thick gloves.
p113
aVAnd what you should know about African penguins
p114
aVis that they have razor-sharp beaks.
p115
aVAnd before long,
p116
aVour bodies were covered head to toe
p117
aVwith these nasty wounds inflicted by the terrified penguins.
p118
aa(lp119
VNow the day after we arrived, a new crisis began to unfold.
p120
aVThe oil slick was now moving north towards Dassen Island,
p121
aVand the rescuers despaired,
p122
aVbecause they knew if the oil hit,
p123
aVit would not be possible to rescue any more oiled birds.
p124
aVAnd there really were no good solutions.
p125
aVBut then finally,
p126
aVone of the researchers threw out this crazy idea.
p127
aVHe said, "OK, why don't we try and collect the birds
p128
aVat the greatest risk of getting oiled" \u2014
p129
aVthey collected 20,000 \u2014
p130
aV"and we'll ship them 500 miles up the coast to Port Elizabeth
p131
aVin these open-air trucks,
p132
aVand release them into the clean waters there
p133
aVand let them swim back home?"
p134
aa(lp135
V(Laughter)
p136
aa(lp137
VSo three of those penguins \u2014 Peter, Pamela and Percy \u2014
p138
aVwore satellite tags,
p139
aVand the researchers crossed their fingers
p140
aVand hoped that by the time they got back home,
p141
aVthe oil would be cleaned up from their islands.
p142
aVAnd luckily, the day they arrived, it was.
p143
aVSo it had been a huge gamble, but it had paid off.
p144
aVAnd so they know now that they can use this strategy
p145
aVin future oil spills.
p146
aa(lp147
VSo in wildlife rescue as in life,
p148
aVwe learn from each previous experience,
p149
aVand we learn from both our successes and our failures.
p150
aVAnd the main thing learned during the Apollo Sea rescue in '94
p151
aVwas that most of those penguins had died due to the unwitting use
p152
aVof poorly ventilated transport boxes and trucks,
p153
aVbecause they just had not been prepared
p154
aVto deal with so many oiled penguins at once.
p155
aVSo in these six years between these two oil spills,
p156
aVthey've built thousands of these well-ventilated boxes.
p157
aVAnd as a result, during the Treasure rescue,
p158
aVjust 160 penguins died during the transport process,
p159
aVas opposed to 5,000.
p160
aVSo this alone was a huge victory.
p161
aa(lp162
VSomething else learned during the Apollo rescue
p163
aVwas how to train the penguins
p164
aVto take fish freely from their hands,
p165
aVusing these training boxes.
p166
aVAnd we used this technique again during the Treasure rescue.
p167
aVBut an interesting thing was noted during the training process.
p168
aVThe first penguins to make that transition to free feeding
p169
aVwere the ones that had a metal band on their wing
p170
aVfrom the Apollo Sea spill six years earlier.
p171
aVSo penguins learn from previous experience, too.
p172
aa(lp173
VSo all of those penguins had to have the oil meticulously cleaned
p174
aVfrom their bodies.
p175
aVIt would take two people at least an hour just to clean one penguin.
p176
aVWhen you clean a penguin,
p177
aVyou first have to spray it with a degreaser.
p178
aVAnd this brings me to my favorite story from the Treasure rescue.
p179
aVAbout a year prior to this oil spill,
p180
aVa 17-year-old student had invented a degreaser.
p181
aVAnd they'd been using it at SANCCOB with great success,
p182
aVso they began using it during the Treasure rescue.
p183
aVBut partway through, they ran out.
p184
aVSo in a panic, Estelle from SANCCOB called the student
p185
aVand said, "Please, you have to make more!"
p186
aVSo he raced to the lab
p187
aVand made enough to clean the rest of the birds.
p188
aVSo I just think it is the coolest thing
p189
aVthat a teenager invented a product
p190
aVthat helped save the lives of thousands of animals.
p191
aa(lp192
VSo what happened to those 20,000 oiled penguins?
p193
aVAnd was Silvia Gaus right?
p194
aVShould we routinely euthanize all oiled birds
p195
aVbecause most of them are going to die anyway?
p196
aVWell, she could not be more wrong.
p197
aVAfter half a million hours of grueling volunteer labor,
p198
aVmore than 90 percent of those oiled penguins
p199
aVwere successfully returned to the wild.
p200
aVAnd we know from follow-up studies
p201
aVthat they have lived just as long as never-oiled penguins,
p202
aVand bred nearly as successfully.
p203
aa(lp204
VAnd in addition,
p205
aVabout 3,000 penguin chicks were rescued and hand raised.
p206
aVAnd again, we know from long-term monitoring
p207
aVthat more of these hand-raised chicks survive to adulthood and breeding age
p208
aVthan do parent-raised chicks.
p209
aVArmed with this knowledge, SANCCOB has a chick-bolstering project,
p210
aVand every year, they rescue and raise abandoned chicks,
p211
aVand they have a very impressive, 80 percent success rate.
p212
aVThis is critically important,
p213
aVbecause one year ago,
p214
aVthe African penguin was declared endangered.
p215
aVAnd they could be extinct in less than 10 years
p216
aVif we don't do something now to protect them.
p217
aa(lp218
VSo what did I learn
p219
aVfrom this intense and unforgettable experience?
p220
aVPersonally, I learned that I am capable of handling so much more
p221
aVthan I ever dreamed possible.
p222
aVAnd I learned that one person can make a huge difference.
p223
aVJust look at that 17-year-old.
p224
aVAnd when we come together and work as one,
p225
aVwe can achieve extraordinary things.
p226
aVAnd truly, to be a part of something so much larger than yourself
p227
aVis the most rewarding experience you can possibly have.
p228
aa(lp229
VSo I'd like to leave you with one final thought
p230
aVand a challenge, if you will.
p231
aVMy mission as The Penguin Lady is to raise awareness and funding
p232
aVto protect penguins.
p233
aVBut why should any of you care about penguins?
p234
aVWell, you should care because they're an indicator species.
p235
aVAnd simply put: if penguins are dying, it means our oceans are dying.
p236
aVAnd we ultimately will be affected,
p237
aVbecause, as Sylvia Earle says,
p238
aV"The oceans are our life-support system."
p239
aVAnd the two main threats to penguins today
p240
aVare overfishing and global warming.
p241
aVAnd these are two things
p242
aVthat each one of us actually has the power to do something about.
p243
aVSo if we each do our part, together, we can make a difference,
p244
aVand we can help keep penguins from going extinct.
p245
aVHumans have always been the greatest threat to penguins,
p246
aVbut we are now their only hope.
p247
aa(lp248
VThank you.
