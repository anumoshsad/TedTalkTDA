VI'll begin today
p4
aVby sharing a poem
p5
aVwritten by my friend from Malawi,
p6
aVEileen Piri.
p7
aVEileen is only 13 years old,
p8
aVbut when we were going through the collection of poetry that we wrote,
p9
aVI found her poem so interesting,
p10
aVso motivating.
p11
aVSo I'll read it to you.
p12
aVShe entitled her poem "I'll Marry When I Want."
p13
aV(Laughter)
p14
aa(lp15
V"I'll marry when I want.
p16
aVMy mother can't force me to marry.
p17
aVMy father cannot force me to marry.
p18
aVMy uncle, my aunt,
p19
aVmy brother or sister,
p20
aVcannot force me to marry.
p21
aVNo one in the world
p22
aVcan force me to marry.
p23
aVI'll marry when I want.
p24
aVEven if you beat me,
p25
aVeven if you chase me away,
p26
aVeven if you do anything bad to me,
p27
aVI'll marry when I want.
p28
aa(lp29
VI'll marry when I want,
p30
aVbut not before I am well educated,
p31
aVand not before I am all grown up.
p32
aa(lp33
VI'll marry when I want."
p34
aa(lp35
VThis poem might seem odd,
p36
aVwritten by a 13-year-old girl,
p37
aVbut where I and Eileen come from,
p38
aVthis poem, which I have just read to you,
p39
aVis a warrior's cry.
p40
aa(lp41
VI am from Malawi.
p42
aVMalawi is one of the poorest countries,
p43
aVvery poor,
p44
aVwhere gender equality is questionable.
p45
aa(lp46
VGrowing up in that country,
p47
aVI couldn't make my own choices in life.
p48
aVI couldn't even explore
p49
aVpersonal opportunities in life.
p50
aa(lp51
VI will tell you a story
p52
aVof two different girls,
p53
aVtwo beautiful girls.
p54
aVThese girls grew up
p55
aVunder the same roof.
p56
aVThey were eating the same food.
p57
aVSometimes, they would share clothes,
p58
aVand even shoes.
p59
aVBut their lives ended up differently,
p60
aVin two different paths.
p61
aVThe other girl is my little sister.
p62
aVMy little sister was only 11 years old
p63
aVwhen she got pregnant.
p64
aVIt's a hurtful thing.
p65
aVNot only did it hurt her, even me.
p66
aVI was going through a hard time as well.
p67
aa(lp68
VAs it is in my culture,
p69
aVonce you reach puberty stage,
p70
aVyou are supposed to go to initiation camps.
p71
aVIn these initiation camps,
p72
aVyou are taught how to sexually please a man.
p73
aVThere is this special day,
p74
aVwhich they call "Very Special Day"
p75
aVwhere a man who is hired by the community
p76
aVcomes to the camp
p77
aVand sleeps with the little girls.
p78
aVImagine the trauma that these young girls
p79
aVgo through every day.
p80
aVMost girls end up pregnant.
p81
aVThey even contract HIV and AIDS
p82
aVand other sexually transmitted diseases.
p83
aa(lp84
VFor my little sister, she ended up being pregnant.
p85
aVToday, she's only 16 years old
p86
aVand she has three children.
p87
aVHer first marriage did not survive,
p88
aVnor did her second marriage.
p89
aa(lp90
VOn the other side, there is this girl.
p91
aVShe's amazing.
p92
aV(Laughter)
p93
aV(Applause)
p94
aVI call her amazing because she is.
p95
aVShe's very fabulous.
p96
aVThat girl is me. (Laughter)
p97
aVWhen I was 13 years old,
p98
aVI was told, you are grown up,
p99
aVyou have now reached of age,
p100
aVyou're supposed to go to the initiation camp.
p101
aVI was like, "What?
p102
aVI'm not going to go to the initiation camps."
p103
aVYou know what the women said to me?
p104
aV"You are a stupid girl. Stubborn.
p105
aVYou do not respect the traditions of our society, of our community."
p106
aa(lp107
VI said no because I knew where I was going.
p108
aVI knew what I wanted in life.
p109
aVI had a lot of dreams as a young girl.
p110
aVI wanted to get well educated,
p111
aVto find a decent job in the future.
p112
aVI was imagining myself as a lawyer,
p113
aVseated on that big chair.
p114
aVThose were the imaginations that
p115
aVwere going through my mind every day.
p116
aVAnd I knew that one day,
p117
aVI would contribute something, a little something to my community.
p118
aVBut every day after refusing,
p119
aVwomen would tell me,
p120
aV"Look at you, you're all grown up. Your little sister has a baby.
p121
aVWhat about you?"
p122
aVThat was the music that I was hearing every day,
p123
aVand that is the music that girls hear every day
p124
aVwhen they don't do something that the community needs them to do.
p125
aa(lp126
VWhen I compared the two stories between me and my sister,
p127
aVI said, "Why can't I do something?
p128
aVWhy can't I change something that has happened for a long time
p129
aVin our community?"
p130
aa(lp131
VThat was when I called other girls
p132
aVjust like my sister, who have children,
p133
aVwho have been in class but they have forgotten how to read and write.
p134
aVI said, "Come on, we can  remind each other
p135
aVhow to read and write again,
p136
aVhow to hold the pen, how to read, to hold the book."
p137
aVIt was a great time I had with them.
p138
aVNor did I just learn a little about them,
p139
aVbut they were able to tell me their personal stories,
p140
aVwhat they were facing every day
p141
aVas young mothers.
p142
aVThat was when I was like,
p143
aV'Why can't we take all these things that are happening to us
p144
aVand present them and tell our mothers, our traditional leaders,
p145
aVthat these are the wrong things?"
p146
aVIt was a scary thing to do,
p147
aVbecause these traditional leaders,
p148
aVthey are already accustomed to the things
p149
aVthat have been there for ages.
p150
aVA hard thing to change,
p151
aVbut a good thing to try.
p152
aa(lp153
VSo we tried.
p154
aVIt was very hard, but we pushed.
p155
aVAnd I'm here to say that in my community,
p156
aVit was the first community after girls
p157
aVpushed so hard to our traditional leader,
p158
aVand our leader stood up for us and said no girl has to be married
p159
aVbefore the age of 18.
p160
aV(Applause)
p161
aa(lp162
VIn my community,
p163
aVthat was the first time a community,
p164
aVthey had to call the bylaws,
p165
aVthe first bylaw that protected girls
p166
aVin our community.
p167
aa(lp168
VWe did not stop there.
p169
aVWe forged ahead.
p170
aVWe were determined to fight for girls not just in my community,
p171
aVbut even in other communities.
p172
aVWhen the child marriage bill was being presented in February,
p173
aVwe were there at the Parliament house.
p174
aVEvery day, when the members of Parliament were entering,
p175
aVwe were telling them, "Would you please support the bill?"
p176
aVAnd we don't have much technology like here,
p177
aVbut we have our small phones.
p178
aVSo we said, "Why can't we get  their numbers and text them?"
p179
aVSo we did that. It was a good thing.
p180
aV(Applause)
p181
aVSo when the bill passed, we texted them back,
p182
aV"Thank you for supporting the bill."
p183
aV(Laughter)
p184
aVAnd when the bill was signed by the president,
p185
aVmaking it into law, it was a plus.
p186
aVNow, in Malawi, 18 is the legal marriage age, from 15 to 18.
p187
aV(Applause)
p188
aa(lp189
VIt's a good thing to know that the bill passed,
p190
aVbut let me tell you this:
p191
aVThere are countries where 18 is the legal marriage age,
p192
aVbut don't we hear cries of women and girls every day?
p193
aVEvery day, girls' lives are being wasted away.
p194
aVThis is high time for leaders to honor their commitment.
p195
aVIn honoring this commitment,
p196
aVit means keeping girls' issues at heart every time.
p197
aVWe don't have to be subjected as second,
p198
aVbut they have to know that women, as we are in this room,
p199
aVwe are not just women, we are not just girls,
p200
aVwe are extraordinary.
p201
aVWe can do more.
p202
aa(lp203
VAnd another thing for Malawi,
p204
aVand not just Malawi but other countries:
p205
aVThe laws which are there,
p206
aVyou know how a law is not a law until it is enforced?
p207
aVThe law which has just recently passed
p208
aVand the laws that in other countries have been there,
p209
aVthey need to be publicized at the local level,
p210
aVat the community level,
p211
aVwhere girls' issues are very striking.
p212
aVGirls face issues, difficult issues, at the community level every day.
p213
aVSo if these young girls know that there are laws that protect them,
p214
aVthey will be able to stand up and defend themselves
p215
aVbecause they will know that there is a law that protects them.
p216
aa(lp217
VAnd another thing I would say is that
p218
aVgirls' voices and women's voices
p219
aVare beautiful, they are there,
p220
aVbut we cannot do this alone.
p221
aVMale advocates, they have to jump in,
p222
aVto step in and work together.
p223
aVIt's a collective work.
p224
aVWhat we need is what girls elsewhere need:
p225
aVgood education, and above all, not to marry whilst 11.
p226
aa(lp227
VAnd furthermore,
p228
aVI know that together,
p229
aVwe can transform the legal,
p230
aVthe cultural and political framework
p231
aVthat denies girls of their rights.
p232
aVI am standing here today
p233
aVand declaring that we can end child marriage in a generation.
p234
aVThis is the moment
p235
aVwhere a girl and a girl, and millions of girls worldwide,
p236
aVwill be able to say,
p237
aV"I will marry when I want."
p238
aa(lp239
V(Applause)
p240
aa(lp241
VThank you. (Applause)
