VChris Anderson: Elon, hey, welcome back to TED.
p4
aVIt's great to have you here.
p5
aa(lp6
VElon Musk: Thanks for having me.
p7
aa(lp8
VCA: So, in the next half hour or so,
p9
aVwe're going to spend some time
p10
aVexploring your vision for what an exciting future might look like,
p11
aVwhich I guess makes the first question a little ironic:
p12
aVWhy are you boring?
p13
aa(lp14
VEM: Yeah.
p15
aVI ask myself that frequently.
p16
aVWe're trying to dig a hole under LA,
p17
aVand this is to create the beginning
p18
aVof what will hopefully be a 3D network of tunnels
p19
aVto alleviate congestion.
p20
aVSo right now, one of the most soul-destroying things is traffic.
p21
aVIt affects people in every part of the world.
p22
aVIt takes away so much of your life.
p23
aVIt's horrible.
p24
aVIt's particularly horrible in LA.
p25
aa(lp26
V(Laughter)
p27
aa(lp28
VCA: I think you've brought with you
p29
aVthe first visualization that's been shown of this.
p30
aVCan I show this?
p31
aa(lp32
VEM: Yeah, absolutely. So this is the first time \u2014
p33
aVJust to show what we're talking about.
p34
aVSo a couple of key things that are important
p35
aVin having a 3D tunnel network.
p36
aVFirst of all, you have to be able
p37
aVto integrate the entrance and exit of the tunnel
p38
aVseamlessly into the fabric of the city.
p39
aVSo by having an elevator,
p40
aVsort of a car skate, that's on an elevator,
p41
aVyou can integrate the entrance and exits to the tunnel network
p42
aVjust by using two parking spaces.
p43
aVAnd then the car gets on a skate.
p44
aVThere's no speed limit here,
p45
aVso we're designing this to be able to operate at 200 kilometers an hour.
p46
aa(lp47
VCA: How much?
p48
aa(lp49
VEM: 200 kilometers an hour, or about 130 miles per hour.
p50
aVSo you should be able to get from, say, Westwood to LAX
p51
aVin six minutes \u2014 five, six minutes.
p52
aa(lp53
V(Applause)
p54
aa(lp55
VCA: So possibly, initially done,
p56
aVit's like on a sort of toll road-type basis.
p57
aa(lp58
VEM: Yeah.
p59
aa(lp60
VCA: Which, I guess, alleviates some traffic
p61
aVfrom the surface streets as well.
p62
aa(lp63
VEM: So, I don't know if people noticed it in the video,
p64
aVbut there's no real limit to how many levels of tunnel you can have.
p65
aVYou can go much further deep than you can go up.
p66
aVThe deepest mines are much deeper than the tallest buildings are tall,
p67
aVso you can alleviate any arbitrary level of urban congestion
p68
aVwith a 3D tunnel network.
p69
aVThis is a very important point.
p70
aVSo a key rebuttal to the tunnels is that if you add one layer of tunnels,
p71
aVthat will simply alleviate congestion, it will get used up,
p72
aVand then you'll be back where you started, back with congestion.
p73
aVBut you can go to any arbitrary number of tunnels,
p74
aVany number of levels.
p75
aa(lp76
VCA: But people \u2014 seen traditionally, it's incredibly expensive to dig,
p77
aVand that would block this idea.
p78
aa(lp79
VEM: Yeah.
p80
aVWell, they're right.
p81
aVTo give you an example, the LA subway extension,
p82
aVwhich is \u2014 I think it's a two-and-a-half mile extension
p83
aVthat was just completed for two billion dollars.
p84
aVSo it's roughly a billion dollars a mile to do the subway extension in LA.
p85
aVAnd this is not the highest utility subway in the world.
p86
aVSo yeah, it's quite difficult to dig tunnels normally.
p87
aVI think we need to have at least a tenfold improvement
p88
aVin the cost per mile of tunneling.
p89
aa(lp90
VCA: And how could you achieve that?
p91
aa(lp92
VEM: Actually, if you just do two things,
p93
aVyou can get to approximately an order of magnitude improvement,
p94
aVand I think you can go beyond that.
p95
aVSo the first thing to do is to cut the tunnel diameter
p96
aVby a factor of two or more.
p97
aVSo a single road lane tunnel according to regulations
p98
aVhas to be 26 feet, maybe 28 feet in diameter
p99
aVto allow for crashes and emergency vehicles
p100
aVand sufficient ventilation for combustion engine cars.
p101
aVBut if you shrink that diameter to what we're attempting,
p102
aVwhich is 12 feet, which is plenty to get an electric skate through,
p103
aVyou drop the diameter by a factor of two
p104
aVand the cross-sectional area by a factor of four,
p105
aVand the tunneling cost scales with the cross-sectional area.
p106
aVSo that's roughly a half-order of magnitude improvement right there.
p107
aVThen tunneling machines currently tunnel for half the time, then they stop,
p108
aVand then the rest of the time is putting in reinforcements
p109
aVfor the tunnel wall.
p110
aVSo if you design the machine instead
p111
aVto do continuous tunneling and reinforcing,
p112
aVthat will give you a factor of two improvement.
p113
aVCombine that and that's a factor of eight.
p114
aVAlso these machines are far from being at their power or thermal limits,
p115
aVso you can jack up the power to the machine substantially.
p116
aVI think you can get at least a factor of two,
p117
aVmaybe a factor of four or five improvement on top of that.
p118
aVSo I think there's a fairly straightforward series of steps
p119
aVto get somewhere in excess of an order of magnitude improvement
p120
aVin the cost per mile,
p121
aVand our target actually is \u2014
p122
aVwe've got a pet snail called Gary,
p123
aVthis is from Gary the snail from "South Park,"
p124
aVI mean, sorry, "SpongeBob SquarePants."
p125
aa(lp126
V(Laughter)
p127
aa(lp128
VSo Gary is capable of \u2014
p129
aVcurrently he's capable of going 14 times faster
p130
aVthan a tunnel-boring machine.
p131
aa(lp132
V(Laughter)
p133
aa(lp134
VCA: You want to beat Gary.
p135
aa(lp136
VEM: We want to beat Gary.
p137
aa(lp138
V(Laughter)
p139
aa(lp140
VHe's not a patient little fellow,
p141
aVand that will be victory.
p142
aVVictory is beating the snail.
p143
aa(lp144
VCA: But a lot of people imagining, dreaming about future cities,
p145
aVthey imagine that actually the solution is flying cars, drones, etc.
p146
aVYou go aboveground.
p147
aVWhy isn't that a better solution?
p148
aVYou save all that tunneling cost.
p149
aa(lp150
VEM: Right. I'm in favor of flying things.
p151
aVObviously, I do rockets, so I like things that fly.
p152
aVThis is not some inherent bias against flying things,
p153
aVbut there is a challenge with flying cars
p154
aVin that they'll be quite noisy,
p155
aVthe wind force generated will be very high.
p156
aVLet's just say that if something's flying over your head,
p157
aVa whole bunch of flying cars going all over the place,
p158
aVthat is not an anxiety-reducing situation.
p159
aa(lp160
V(Laughter)
p161
aa(lp162
VYou don't think to yourself, "Well, I feel better about today."
p163
aVYou're thinking, "Did they service their hubcap,
p164
aVor is it going to come off and guillotine me?"
p165
aVThings like that.
p166
aa(lp167
VCA: So you've got this vision
p168
aVof future cities with these rich, 3D networks of tunnels underneath.
p169
aVIs there a tie-in here with Hyperloop?
p170
aVCould you apply these tunnels to use for this Hyperloop idea
p171
aVyou released a few years ago.
p172
aa(lp173
VEM: Yeah, so we've been sort of puttering around
p174
aVwith the Hyperloop stuff for a while.
p175
aVWe built a Hyperloop test track adjacent to SpaceX,
p176
aVjust for a student competition,
p177
aVto encourage innovative ideas in transport.
p178
aVAnd it actually ends up being the biggest vacuum chamber in the world
p179
aVafter the Large Hadron Collider,
p180
aVby volume.
p181
aVSo it was quite fun to do that, but it was kind of a hobby thing,
p182
aVand then we think we might \u2014
p183
aVso we've built a little pusher car to push the student pods,
p184
aVbut we're going to try seeing how fast we can make the pusher go
p185
aVif it's not pushing something.
p186
aVSo we're cautiously optimistic
p187
aVwe'll be able to be faster than the world's fastest bullet train
p188
aVeven in a .8-mile stretch.
p189
aa(lp190
VCA: Whoa. Good brakes.
p191
aa(lp192
VEM: Yeah, I mean, it's \u2014 yeah.
p193
aVIt's either going to smash into tiny pieces or go quite fast.
p194
aa(lp195
VCA: But you can picture, then, a Hyperloop in a tunnel
p196
aVrunning quite long distances.
p197
aa(lp198
VEM: Exactly.
p199
aVAnd looking at tunneling technology,
p200
aVit turns out that in order to make a tunnel,
p201
aVyou have to \u2014
p202
aVIn order to seal against the water table,
p203
aVyou've got to typically design a tunnel wall to be good
p204
aVto about five or six atmospheres.
p205
aVSo to go to vacuum is only one atmosphere,
p206
aVor near-vacuum.
p207
aVSo actually, it sort of turns out that automatically,
p208
aVif you build a tunnel that is good enough to resist the water table,
p209
aVit is automatically capable of holding vacuum.
p210
aa(lp211
VCA: Huh.
p212
aa(lp213
VEM: So, yeah.
p214
aa(lp215
VCA: And so you could actually picture,
p216
aVwhat kind of length tunnel is in Elon's future to running Hyperloop?
p217
aa(lp218
VEM: I think there's no real length limit.
p219
aVYou could dig as much as you want.
p220
aVI think if you were to do something
p221
aVlike a DC-to-New York Hyperloop,
p222
aVI think you'd probably want to go underground the entire way
p223
aVbecause it's a high-density area.
p224
aVYou're going under a lot of buildings and houses,
p225
aVand if you go deep enough,
p226
aVyou cannot detect the tunnel.
p227
aVSometimes people think, well, it's going to be pretty annoying
p228
aVto have a tunnel dug under my house.
p229
aVLike, if that tunnel is dug
p230
aVmore than about three or four tunnel diameters beneath your house,
p231
aVyou will not be able to detect it being dug at all.
p232
aVIn fact, if you're able to detect the tunnel being dug,
p233
aVwhatever device you are using,
p234
aVyou can get a lot of money for that device from the Israeli military,
p235
aVwho is trying to detect tunnels from Hamas,
p236
aVand from the US Customs and Border patrol that try and detect drug tunnels.
p237
aVSo the reality is
p238
aVthat earth is incredibly good at absorbing vibrations,
p239
aVand once the tunnel depth is below a certain level,
p240
aVit is undetectable.
p241
aVMaybe if you have a very sensitive seismic instrument,
p242
aVyou might be able to detect it.
p243
aa(lp244
VCA: So you've started a new company to do this
p245
aVcalled The Boring Company.
p246
aVVery nice. Very funny.
p247
aa(lp248
V(Laughter)
p249
aa(lp250
VEM: What's funny about that?
p251
aa(lp252
V(Laughter)
p253
aa(lp254
VCA: How much of your time is this?
p255
aa(lp256
VEM: It's maybe ...
p257
aVtwo or three percent.
p258
aa(lp259
VCA: You've bought a hobby.
p260
aVThis is what an Elon Musk hobby looks like.
p261
aa(lp262
V(Laughter)
p263
aa(lp264
VEM: I mean, it really is, like \u2014
p265
aVThis is basically interns and people doing it part time.
p266
aVWe bought some second-hand machinery.
p267
aVIt's kind of puttering along, but it's making good progress, so \u2014
p268
aa(lp269
VCA: So an even bigger part of your time
p270
aVis being spent on electrifying cars and transport through Tesla.
p271
aVIs one of the motivations for the tunneling project
p272
aVthe realization that actually,
p273
aVin a world where cars are electric and where they're self-driving,
p274
aVthere may end up being more cars on the roads
p275
aVon any given hour than there are now?
p276
aa(lp277
VEM: Yeah, exactly.
p278
aVA lot of people think that when you make cars autonomous,
p279
aVthey'll be able to go faster and that will alleviate congestion.
p280
aVAnd to some degree that will be true,
p281
aVbut once you have shared autonomy where it's much cheaper to go by car
p282
aVand you can go point to point,
p283
aVthe affordability of going in a car will be better than that of a bus.
p284
aVLike, it will cost less than a bus ticket.
p285
aVSo the amount of driving that will occur will be much greater with shared autonomy,
p286
aVand actually traffic will get far worse.
p287
aa(lp288
VCA: You started Tesla with the goal of persuading the world
p289
aVthat electrification was the future of cars,
p290
aVand a few years ago, people were laughing at you.
p291
aVNow, not so much.
p292
aa(lp293
VEM: OK.
p294
aa(lp295
V(Laughter)
p296
aa(lp297
VI don't know. I don't know.
p298
aa(lp299
VCA: But isn't it true that pretty much every auto manufacturer
p300
aVhas announced serious electrification plans
p301
aVfor the short- to medium-term future?
p302
aa(lp303
VEM: Yeah. Yeah.
p304
aVI think almost every automaker has some electric vehicle program.
p305
aVThey vary in seriousness.
p306
aVSome are very serious about transitioning entirely to electric,
p307
aVand some are just dabbling in it.
p308
aVAnd some, amazingly, are still pursuing fuel cells,
p309
aVbut I think that won't last much longer.
p310
aa(lp311
VCA: But isn't there a sense, though, Elon,
p312
aVwhere you can now just declare victory and say, you know, "We did it."
p313
aVLet the world electrify, and you go on and focus on other stuff?
p314
aa(lp315
VEM: Yeah.
p316
aVI intend to stay with Tesla as far into the future as I can imagine,
p317
aVand there are a lot of exciting things that we have coming.
p318
aVObviously the Model 3 is coming soon.
p319
aVWe'll be unveiling the Tesla Semi truck.
p320
aa(lp321
VCA: OK, we're going to come to this.
p322
aVSo Model 3, it's supposed to be coming in July-ish.
p323
aa(lp324
VEM: Yeah, it's looking quite good for starting production in July.
p325
aa(lp326
VCA: Wow.
p327
aVOne of the things that people are so excited about
p328
aVis the fact that it's got autopilot.
p329
aVAnd you put out this video a while back
p330
aVshowing what that technology would look like.
p331
aa(lp332
VEM: Yeah.
p333
aa(lp334
VCA: There's obviously autopilot in Model S right now.
p335
aVWhat are we seeing here?
p336
aa(lp337
VEM: Yeah, so this is using only cameras and GPS.
p338
aVSo there's no LIDAR or radar being used here.
p339
aVThis is just using passive optical, which is essentially what a person uses.
p340
aVThe whole road system is meant to be navigated
p341
aVwith passive optical, or cameras,
p342
aVand so once you solve cameras
p343
aVor vision,
p344
aVthen autonomy is solved.
p345
aVIf you don't solve vision, it's not solved.
p346
aVSo that's why our focus is so heavily on having a vision neural net
p347
aVthat's very effective for road conditions.
p348
aa(lp349
VCA: Right. Many other people are going the LIDAR route.
p350
aVYou want cameras plus radar is most of it.
p351
aa(lp352
VEM: You can absolutely be superhuman with just cameras.
p353
aVLike, you can probably do it ten times better than humans would,
p354
aVjust cameras.
p355
aa(lp356
VCA: So the new cars being sold right now have eight cameras in them.
p357
aVThey can't yet do what that showed.
p358
aVWhen will they be able to?
p359
aa(lp360
VEM: I think we're still on track for being able to go cross-country
p361
aVfrom LA to New York by the end of the year, fully autonomous.
p362
aa(lp363
VCA: OK, so by the end of the year, you're saying,
p364
aVsomeone's going to sit in a Tesla without touching the steering wheel,
p365
aVtap in "New York," off it goes.
p366
aa(lp367
VEM: Yeah.
p368
aa(lp369
VCA: Won't ever have to touch the wheel \u2014 by the end of 2017.
p370
aa(lp371
VEM: Yeah. Essentially, November or December of this year,
p372
aVwe should be able to go all the way from a parking lot in California
p373
aVto a parking lot in New York,
p374
aVno controls touched at any point during the entire journey.
p375
aa(lp376
V(Applause)
p377
aa(lp378
VCA: Amazing.
p379
aVBut part of that is possible
p380
aVbecause you've already got a fleet of Teslas driving all these roads.
p381
aVYou're accumulating a huge amount of data of that national road system.
p382
aa(lp383
VEM: Yes, but the thing that will be interesting
p384
aVis that I'm actually fairly confident it will be able to do that route
p385
aVeven if you change the route dynamically.
p386
aVSo, it's fairly easy \u2014
p387
aVIf you say I'm going to be really good at one specific route, that's one thing,
p388
aVbut it should be able to go, really be very good,
p389
aVcertainly once you enter a highway,
p390
aVto go anywhere on the highway system
p391
aVin a given country.
p392
aVSo it's not sort of limited to LA to New York.
p393
aVWe could change it and make it Seattle-Florida,
p394
aVthat day, in real time.
p395
aVSo you were going from LA to New York.
p396
aVNow go from LA to Toronto.
p397
aa(lp398
VCA: So leaving aside regulation for a second,
p399
aVin terms of the technology alone,
p400
aVthe time when someone will be able to buy one of your cars
p401
aVand literally just take the hands off the wheel and go to sleep
p402
aVand wake up and find that they've arrived,
p403
aVhow far away is that, to do that safely?
p404
aa(lp405
VEM: I think that's about two years.
p406
aVSo the real trick of it is not how do you make it work
p407
aVsay 99.9 percent of the time,
p408
aVbecause, like, if a car crashes one in a thousand times,
p409
aVthen you're probably still not going to be comfortable falling asleep.
p410
aVYou shouldn't be, certainly.
p411
aa(lp412
V(Laughter)
p413
aa(lp414
VIt's never going to be perfect.
p415
aVNo system is going to be perfect,
p416
aVbut if you say it's perhaps \u2014
p417
aVthe car is unlikely to crash
p418
aVin a hundred lifetimes, or a thousand lifetimes,
p419
aVthen people are like, OK, wow, if I were to live a thousand lives,
p420
aVI would still most likely never experience a crash,
p421
aVthen that's probably OK.
p422
aa(lp423
VCA: To sleep.
p424
aVI guess the big concern of yours is that people may actually
p425
aVget seduced too early to think that this is safe,
p426
aVand that you'll have some horrible incident happen that puts things back.
p427
aa(lp428
VEM: Well, I think that the autonomy system is likely to at least mitigate the crash,
p429
aVexcept in rare circumstances.
p430
aVThe thing to appreciate about vehicle safety
p431
aVis this is probabilistic.
p432
aVI mean, there's some chance that any time a human driver gets in a car,
p433
aVthat they will have an accident that is their fault.
p434
aVIt's never zero.
p435
aVSo really the key threshold for autonomy
p436
aVis how much better does autonomy need to be than a person
p437
aVbefore you can rely on it?
p438
aa(lp439
VCA: But once you get literally safe hands-off driving,
p440
aVthe power to disrupt the whole industry seems massive,
p441
aVbecause at that point you've spoken of people being able to buy a car,
p442
aVdrops you off at work, and then you let it go
p443
aVand provide a sort of Uber-like service to other people,
p444
aVearn you money,
p445
aVmaybe even cover the cost of your lease of that car,
p446
aVso you can kind of get a car for free.
p447
aVIs that really likely?
p448
aa(lp449
VEM: Yeah. Absolutely this is what will happen.
p450
aVSo there will be a shared autonomy fleet
p451
aVwhere you buy your car
p452
aVand you can choose to use that car exclusively,
p453
aVyou could choose to have it be used only by friends and family,
p454
aVonly by other drivers who are rated five star,
p455
aVyou can choose to share it sometimes but not other times.
p456
aVThat's 100 percent what will occur.
p457
aVIt's just a question of when.
p458
aa(lp459
VCA: Wow.
p460
aVSo you mentioned the Semi
p461
aVand I think you're planning to announce this in September,
p462
aVbut I'm curious whether there's anything you could show us today?
p463
aa(lp464
VEM: I will show you a teaser shot of the truck.
p465
aa(lp466
V(Laughter)
p467
aa(lp468
VIt's alive.
p469
aa(lp470
VCA: OK.
p471
aa(lp472
VEM: That's definitely a case where we want to be cautious
p473
aVabout the autonomy features.
p474
aVYeah.
p475
aa(lp476
V(Laughter)
p477
aa(lp478
VCA: We can't see that much of it,
p479
aVbut it doesn't look like just a little friendly neighborhood truck.
p480
aVIt looks kind of badass.
p481
aVWhat sort of semi is this?
p482
aa(lp483
VEM: So this is a heavy duty, long-range semitruck.
p484
aVSo it's the highest weight capability
p485
aVand with long range.
p486
aVSo essentially it's meant to alleviate the heavy-duty trucking loads.
p487
aVAnd this is something which people do not today think is possible.
p488
aVThey think the truck doesn't have enough power or it doesn't have enough range,
p489
aVand then with the Tesla Semi
p490
aVwe want to show that no, an electric truck
p491
aVactually can out-torque any diesel semi.
p492
aVAnd if you had a tug-of-war competition,
p493
aVthe Tesla Semi will tug the diesel semi uphill.
p494
aa(lp495
V(Laughter)
p496
aa(lp497
V(Applause)
p498
aa(lp499
VCA: That's pretty cool. And short term, these aren't driverless.
p500
aVThese are going to be trucks that truck drivers want to drive.
p501
aa(lp502
VEM: Yes. So what will be really fun about this
p503
aVis you have a flat torque RPM curve with an electric motor,
p504
aVwhereas with a diesel motor or any kind of internal combustion engine car,
p505
aVyou've got a torque RPM curve that looks like a hill.
p506
aVSo this will be a very spry truck.
p507
aVYou can drive this around like a sports car.
p508
aVThere's no gears. It's, like, single speed.
p509
aa(lp510
VCA: There's a great movie to be made here somewhere.
p511
aVI don't know what it is and I don't know that it ends well,
p512
aVbut it's a great movie.
p513
aa(lp514
V(Laughter)
p515
aa(lp516
VEM: It's quite bizarre test-driving.
p517
aVWhen I was driving the test prototype for the first truck.
p518
aVIt's really weird, because you're driving around
p519
aVand you're just so nimble, and you're in this giant truck.
p520
aa(lp521
VCA: Wait, you've already driven a prototype?
p522
aa(lp523
VEM: Yeah, I drove it around the parking lot,
p524
aVand I was like, this is crazy.
p525
aa(lp526
VCA: Wow. This is no vaporware.
p527
aa(lp528
VEM: It's just like, driving this giant truck
p529
aVand making these mad maneuvers.
p530
aa(lp531
VCA: This is cool. OK, from a really badass picture
p532
aVto a kind of less badass picture.
p533
aVThis is just a cute house from "Desperate Housewives" or something.
p534
aVWhat on earth is going on here?
p535
aa(lp536
VEM: Well, this illustrates the picture of the future
p537
aVthat I think is how things will evolve.
p538
aVYou've got an electric car in the driveway.
p539
aVIf you look in between the electric car and the house,
p540
aVthere are actually three Powerwalls stacked up against the side of the house,
p541
aVand then that house roof is a solar roof.
p542
aVSo that's an actual solar glass roof.
p543
aa(lp544
VCA: OK.
p545
aa(lp546
VEM: That's a picture of a real \u2014 well, admittedly, it's a real fake house.
p547
aVThat's a real fake house.
p548
aa(lp549
V(Laughter)
p550
aa(lp551
VCA: So these roof tiles,
p552
aVsome of them have in them basically solar power, the ability to \u2014
p553
aa(lp554
VEM: Yeah. Solar glass tiles
p555
aVwhere you can adjust the texture and the color
p556
aVto a very fine-grained level,
p557
aVand then there's sort of microlouvers in the glass,
p558
aVsuch that when you're looking at the roof from street level
p559
aVor close to street level,
p560
aVall the tiles look the same
p561
aVwhether there is a solar cell behind it or not.
p562
aVSo you have an even color
p563
aVfrom the ground level.
p564
aVIf you were to look at it from a helicopter,
p565
aVyou would be actually able to look through and see
p566
aVthat some of the glass tiles have a solar cell behind them and some do not.
p567
aVYou can't tell from street level.
p568
aa(lp569
VCA: You put them in the ones that are likely to see a lot of sun,
p570
aVand that makes these roofs super affordable, right?
p571
aVThey're not that much more expensive than just tiling the roof.
p572
aa(lp573
VEM: Yeah.
p574
aVWe're very confident that the cost of the roof
p575
aVplus the cost of electricity \u2014
p576
aVA solar glass roof will be less than the cost of a normal roof
p577
aVplus the cost of electricity.
p578
aVSo in other words,
p579
aVthis will be economically a no-brainer,
p580
aVwe think it will look great,
p581
aVand it will last \u2014
p582
aVWe thought about having the warranty be infinity,
p583
aVbut then people thought,
p584
aVwell, that might sound like were just talking rubbish,
p585
aVbut actually this is toughened glass.
p586
aVWell after the house has collapsed
p587
aVand there's nothing there,
p588
aVthe glass tiles will still be there.
p589
aa(lp590
V(Applause)
p591
aa(lp592
VCA: I mean, this is cool.
p593
aVSo you're rolling this out in a couple week's time, I think,
p594
aVwith four different roofing types.
p595
aa(lp596
VEM: Yeah, we're starting off with two, two initially,
p597
aVand the second two will be introduced early next year.
p598
aa(lp599
VCA: And what's the scale of ambition here?
p600
aVHow many houses do you believe could end up having this type of roofing?
p601
aa(lp602
VEM: I think eventually
p603
aValmost all houses will have a solar roof.
p604
aVThe thing is to consider the time scale here
p605
aVto be probably on the order
p606
aVof 40 or 50 years.
p607
aVSo on average, a roof is replaced every 20 to 25 years.
p608
aVBut you don't start replacing all roofs immediately.
p609
aVBut eventually, if you say were to fast-forward
p610
aVto say 15 years from now,
p611
aVit will be unusual to have a roof that does not have solar.
p612
aa(lp613
VCA: Is there a mental model thing that people don't get here
p614
aVthat because of the shift in the cost, the economics of solar power,
p615
aVmost houses actually have enough sunlight on their roof
p616
aVpretty much to power all of their needs.
p617
aVIf you could capture the power,
p618
aVit could pretty much power all their needs.
p619
aVYou could go off-grid, kind of.
p620
aa(lp621
VEM: It depends on where you are
p622
aVand what the house size is relative to the roof area,
p623
aVbut it's a fair statement to say
p624
aVthat most houses in the US have enough roof area
p625
aVto power all the needs of the house.
p626
aa(lp627
VCA: So the key to the economics
p628
aVof the cars, the Semi, of these houses
p629
aVis the falling price of lithium-ion batteries,
p630
aVwhich you've made a huge bet on as Tesla.
p631
aVIn many ways, that's almost the core competency.
p632
aVAnd you've decided
p633
aVthat to really, like, own that competency,
p634
aVyou just have to build the world's largest manufacturing plant
p635
aVto double the world's supply of lithium-ion batteries,
p636
aVwith this guy. What is this?
p637
aa(lp638
VEM: Yeah, so that's the Gigafactory,
p639
aVprogress so far on the Gigafactory.
p640
aVEventually, you can sort of roughly see
p641
aVthat there's sort of a diamond shape overall,
p642
aVand when it's fully done, it'll look like a giant diamond,
p643
aVor that's the idea behind it,
p644
aVand it's aligned on true north.
p645
aVIt's a small detail.
p646
aa(lp647
VCA: And capable of producing, eventually,
p648
aVlike a hundred gigawatt hours of batteries a year.
p649
aa(lp650
VEM: A hundred gigawatt hours. We think probably more, but yeah.
p651
aa(lp652
VCA: And they're actually being produced right now.
p653
aa(lp654
VEM: They're in production already. CA: You guys put out this video.
p655
aVI mean, is that speeded up?
p656
aa(lp657
VEM: That's the slowed down version.
p658
aa(lp659
V(Laughter)
p660
aa(lp661
VCA: How fast does it actually go?
p662
aa(lp663
VEM: Well, when it's running at full speed,
p664
aVyou can't actually see the cells without a strobe light.
p665
aVIt's just blur.
p666
aa(lp667
V(Laughter)
p668
aa(lp669
VCA: One of your core ideas, Elon, about what makes an exciting future
p670
aVis a future where we no longer feel guilty about energy.
p671
aVHelp us picture this.
p672
aVHow many Gigafactories, if you like, does it take to get us there?
p673
aa(lp674
VEM: It's about a hundred, roughly.
p675
aVIt's not 10, it's not a thousand.
p676
aVMost likely a hundred.
p677
aa(lp678
VCA: See, I find this amazing.
p679
aVYou can picture what it would take
p680
aVto move the world off this vast fossil fuel thing.
p681
aVIt's like you're building one,
p682
aVit costs five billion dollars,
p683
aVor whatever, five to 10 billion dollars.
p684
aVLike, it's kind of cool that you can picture that project.
p685
aVAnd you're planning to do, at Tesla \u2014 announce another two this year.
p686
aa(lp687
VEM: I think we'll announce locations
p688
aVfor somewhere between two and four Gigafactories later this year.
p689
aVYeah, probably four.
p690
aa(lp691
VCA: Whoa.
p692
aa(lp693
V(Applause)
p694
aVNo more teasing from you for here?
p695
aVLike \u2014 where, continent?
p696
aVYou can say no.
p697
aa(lp698
VEM: We need to address a global market.
p699
aa(lp700
VCA: OK.
p701
aa(lp702
V(Laughter)
p703
aa(lp704
VThis is cool.
p705
aVI think we should talk for \u2014
p706
aVActually, double mark it.
p707
aVI'm going to ask you one question about politics, only one.
p708
aVI'm kind of sick of politics, but I do want to ask you this.
p709
aVYou're on a body now giving advice to a guy \u2014
p710
aa(lp711
VEM: Who?
p712
aa(lp713
VCA: Who has said he doesn't really believe in climate change,
p714
aVand there's a lot of people out there who think you shouldn't be doing that.
p715
aVThey'd like you to walk away from that.
p716
aVWhat would you say to them?
p717
aa(lp718
VEM: Well, I think that first of all,
p719
aVI'm just on two advisory councils
p720
aVwhere the format consists of going around the room
p721
aVand asking people's opinion on things,
p722
aVand so there's like a meeting every month or two.
p723
aVThat's the sum total of my contribution.
p724
aVBut I think to the degree that there are people in the room
p725
aVwho are arguing in favor of doing something about climate change,
p726
aVor social issues,
p727
aVI've used the meetings I've had thus far
p728
aVto argue in favor of immigration and in favor of climate change.
p729
aa(lp730
V(Applause)
p731
aa(lp732
VAnd if I hadn't done that,
p733
aVthat wasn't on the agenda before.
p734
aVSo maybe nothing will happen, but at least the words were said.
p735
aa(lp736
VCA: OK.
p737
aa(lp738
V(Applause)
p739
aa(lp740
VSo let's talk SpaceX and Mars.
p741
aVLast time you were here,
p742
aVyou spoke about what seemed like a kind of incredibly ambitious dream
p743
aVto develop rockets that were actually reusable.
p744
aVAnd you've only gone and done it.
p745
aa(lp746
VEM: Finally. It took a long time.
p747
aa(lp748
VCA: Talk us through this. What are we looking at here?
p749
aa(lp750
VEM: So this is one of our rocket boosters
p751
aVcoming back from very high and fast in space.
p752
aVSo just delivered the upper stage
p753
aVat high velocity.
p754
aVI think this might have been at sort of Mach 7 or so,
p755
aVdelivery of the upper stage.
p756
aa(lp757
V(Applause)
p758
aa(lp759
VCA: So that was a sped-up \u2014
p760
aa(lp761
VEM: That was the slowed down version.
p762
aa(lp763
V(Laughter)
p764
aa(lp765
VCA: I thought that was the sped-up version.
p766
aVBut I mean, that's amazing,
p767
aVand several of these failed
p768
aVbefore you finally figured out how to do it,
p769
aVbut now you've done this, what, five or six times?
p770
aa(lp771
VEM: We're at eight or nine.
p772
aa(lp773
VCA: And for the first time,
p774
aVyou've actually reflown one of the rockets that landed.
p775
aa(lp776
VEM: Yeah, so we landed the rocket booster
p777
aVand then prepped it for flight again and flew it again,
p778
aVso it's the first reflight of an orbital booster
p779
aVwhere that reflight is relevant.
p780
aVSo it's important to appreciate that reusability is only relevant
p781
aVif it is rapid and complete.
p782
aVSo like an aircraft or a car,
p783
aVthe reusability is rapid and complete.
p784
aVYou do not send your aircraft to Boeing in-between flights.
p785
aa(lp786
VCA: Right. So this is allowing you to dream of this really ambitious idea
p787
aVof sending many, many, many people to Mars
p788
aVin, what, 10 or 20 years time, I guess.
p789
aa(lp790
VEM: Yeah.
p791
aa(lp792
VCA: And you've designed this outrageous rocket to do it.
p793
aVHelp us understand the scale of this thing.
p794
aa(lp795
VEM: Well, visually you can see that's a person.
p796
aVYeah, and that's the vehicle.
p797
aa(lp798
V(Laughter)
p799
aa(lp800
VCA: So if that was a skyscraper,
p801
aVthat's like, did I read that, a 40-story skyscraper?
p802
aa(lp803
VEM: Probably a little more, yeah.
p804
aVThe thrust level of this is really \u2014
p805
aVThis configuration is about four times the thrust of the Saturn V moon rocket.
p806
aa(lp807
VCA: Four times the thrust of the biggest rocket humanity ever created before.
p808
aa(lp809
VEM: Yeah. Yeah.
p810
aa(lp811
VCA: As one does. EM: Yeah.
p812
aa(lp813
V(Laughter)
p814
aa(lp815
VIn units of 747, a 747 is only about a quarter of a million pounds of thrust,
p816
aVso for every 10 million pounds of thrust,
p817
aVthere's 40 747s.
p818
aVSo this would be the thrust equivalent of 120 747s, with all engines blazing.
p819
aa(lp820
VCA: And so even with a machine designed to escape Earth's gravity,
p821
aVI think you told me last time
p822
aVthis thing could actually take a fully loaded 747,
p823
aVpeople, cargo, everything,
p824
aVinto orbit.
p825
aa(lp826
VEM: Exactly. This can take a fully loaded 747 with maximum fuel,
p827
aVmaximum passengers, maximum cargo on the 747 \u2014
p828
aVthis can take it as cargo.
p829
aa(lp830
VCA: So based on this,
p831
aVyou presented recently this Interplanetary Transport System
p832
aVwhich is visualized this way.
p833
aVThis is a scene you picture in, what, 30 years time? 20 years time?
p834
aVPeople walking into this rocket.
p835
aa(lp836
VEM: I'm hopeful it's sort of an eight- to 10-year time frame.
p837
aVAspirationally, that's our target.
p838
aVOur internal targets are more aggressive, but I think \u2014
p839
aa(lp840
V(Laughter)
p841
aa(lp842
VCA: OK.
p843
aa(lp844
VEM: While vehicle seems quite large
p845
aVand is large by comparison with other rockets,
p846
aVI think the future spacecraft
p847
aVwill make this look like a rowboat.
p848
aVThe future spaceships will be truly enormous.
p849
aa(lp850
VCA: Why, Elon?
p851
aVWhy do we need to build a city on Mars
p852
aVwith a million people on it in your lifetime,
p853
aVwhich I think is kind of what you've said you'd love to do?
p854
aa(lp855
VEM: I think it's important to have
p856
aVa future that is inspiring and appealing.
p857
aVI just think there have to be reasons
p858
aVthat you get up in the morning and you want to live.
p859
aVLike, why do you want to live?
p860
aVWhat's the point? What inspires you?
p861
aVWhat do you love about the future?
p862
aVAnd if we're not out there,
p863
aVif the future does not include being out there among the stars
p864
aVand being a multiplanet species,
p865
aVI find that it's incredibly depressing
p866
aVif that's not the future that we're going to have.
p867
aa(lp868
V(Applause)
p869
aa(lp870
VCA: People want to position this as an either or,
p871
aVthat there are so many desperate things happening on the planet now
p872
aVfrom climate to poverty to, you know, you pick your issue.
p873
aVAnd this feels like a distraction.
p874
aVYou shouldn't be thinking about this.
p875
aVYou should be solving what's here and now.
p876
aVAnd to be fair, you've done a fair old bit to actually do that
p877
aVwith your work on sustainable energy.
p878
aVBut why not just do that?
p879
aa(lp880
VEM: I think there's \u2014
p881
aVI look at the future from the standpoint of probabilities.
p882
aVIt's like a branching stream of probabilities,
p883
aVand there are actions that we can take that affect those probabilities
p884
aVor that accelerate one thing or slow down another thing.
p885
aVI may introduce something new to the probability stream.
p886
aVSustainable energy will happen no matter what.
p887
aVIf there was no Tesla, if Tesla never existed,
p888
aVit would have to happen out of necessity.
p889
aVIt's tautological.
p890
aVIf you don't have sustainable energy, it means you have unsustainable energy.
p891
aVEventually you will run out,
p892
aVand the laws of economics will drive civilization
p893
aVtowards sustainable energy,
p894
aVinevitably.
p895
aVThe fundamental value of a company like Tesla
p896
aVis the degree to which it accelerates the advent of sustainable energy,
p897
aVfaster than it would otherwise occur.
p898
aa(lp899
VSo when I think, like,
p900
aVwhat is the fundamental good of a company like Tesla,
p901
aVI would say, hopefully,
p902
aVif it accelerated that by a decade, potentially more than a decade,
p903
aVthat would be quite a good thing to occur.
p904
aVThat's what I consider to be
p905
aVthe fundamental aspirational good of Tesla.
p906
aa(lp907
VThen there's becoming a multiplanet species and space-faring civilization.
p908
aVThis is not inevitable.
p909
aVIt's very important to appreciate this is not inevitable.
p910
aVThe sustainable energy future I think is largely inevitable,
p911
aVbut being a space-faring civilization is definitely not inevitable.
p912
aVIf you look at the progress in space,
p913
aVin 1969 you were able to send somebody to the moon.
p914
aV1969.
p915
aVThen we had the Space Shuttle.
p916
aVThe Space Shuttle could only take people to low Earth orbit.
p917
aVThen the Space Shuttle retired,
p918
aVand the United States could take no one to orbit.
p919
aVSo that's the trend.
p920
aVThe trend is like down to nothing.
p921
aVPeople are mistaken when they think
p922
aVthat technology just automatically improves.
p923
aVIt does not automatically improve.
p924
aVIt only improves if a lot of people work very hard to make it better,
p925
aVand actually it will, I think, by itself degrade, actually.
p926
aVYou look at great civilizations like Ancient Egypt,
p927
aVand they were able to make the pyramids,
p928
aVand they forgot how to do that.
p929
aVAnd then the Romans, they built these incredible aqueducts.
p930
aVThey forgot how to do it.
p931
aa(lp932
VCA: Elon, it almost seems, listening to you
p933
aVand looking at the different things you've done,
p934
aVthat you've got this unique double motivation on everything
p935
aVthat I find so interesting.
p936
aVOne is this desire to work for humanity's long-term good.
p937
aVThe other is the desire to do something exciting.
p938
aVAnd often it feels like you feel like you need the one to drive the other.
p939
aVWith Tesla, you want to have sustainable energy,
p940
aVso you made these super sexy, exciting cars to do it.
p941
aVSolar energy, we need to get there,
p942
aVso we need to make these beautiful roofs.
p943
