VWell, we all need a reason to wake up.
p4
aVFor me, it just took 11,000 volts.
p5
aa(lp6
VI know you're too polite to ask,
p7
aVso I will tell you.
p8
aa(lp9
VOne night, sophomore year of college,
p10
aVjust back from Thanksgiving holiday,
p11
aVa few of my friends and I were horsing around,
p12
aVand we decided to climb atop a parked commuter train.
p13
aVIt was just sitting there, with the wires that run overhead.
p14
aVSomehow, that seemed like a great idea at the time.
p15
aVWe'd certainly done stupider things.
p16
aVI scurried up the ladder on the back,
p17
aVand when I stood up,
p18
aVthe electrical current entered my arm,
p19
aVblew down and out my feet, and that was that.
p20
aVWould you believe that watch still works?
p21
aVTakes a licking!
p22
aa(lp23
V(Laughter)
p24
aa(lp25
VMy father wears it now in solidarity.
p26
aa(lp27
VThat night began my formal relationship with death \u2014 my death \u2014
p28
aVand it also began my long run as a patient.
p29
aVIt's a good word.
p30
aVIt means one who suffers.
p31
aVSo I guess we're all patients.
p32
aa(lp33
VNow, the American health care system
p34
aVhas more than its fair share of dysfunction \u2014
p35
aVto match its brilliance, to be sure.
p36
aVI'm a physician now, a hospice and palliative medicine doc,
p37
aVso I've seen care from both sides.
p38
aVAnd believe me: almost everyone who goes into healthcare
p39
aVreally means well \u2014 I mean, truly.
p40
aVBut we who work in it are also unwitting agents
p41
aVfor a system that too often does not serve.
p42
aa(lp43
VWhy?
p44
aVWell, there's actually a pretty easy answer to that question,
p45
aVand it explains a lot:
p46
aVbecause healthcare was designed with diseases, not people, at its center.
p47
aVWhich is to say, of course, it was badly designed.
p48
aVAnd nowhere are the effects of bad design more heartbreaking
p49
aVor the opportunity for good design more compelling
p50
aVthan at the end of life,
p51
aVwhere things are so distilled and concentrated.
p52
aVThere are no do-overs.
p53
aa(lp54
VMy purpose today is to reach out across disciplines
p55
aVand invite design thinking into this big conversation.
p56
aVThat is, to bring intention and creativity
p57
aVto the experience of dying.
p58
aVWe have a monumental opportunity in front of us,
p59
aVbefore one of the few universal issues
p60
aVas individuals as well as a civil society:
p61
aVto rethink and redesign how it is we die.
p62
aa(lp63
VSo let's begin at the end.
p64
aVFor most people, the scariest thing about death isn't being dead,
p65
aVit's dying, suffering.
p66
aVIt's a key distinction.
p67
aVTo get underneath this, it can be very helpful
p68
aVto tease out suffering which is necessary as it is,
p69
aVfrom suffering we can change.
p70
aVThe former is a natural, essential part of life, part of the deal,
p71
aVand to this we are called to make space, adjust, grow.
p72
aVIt can be really good to realize forces larger than ourselves.
p73
aVThey bring proportionality,
p74
aVlike a cosmic right-sizing.
p75
aVAfter my limbs were gone,
p76
aVthat loss, for example, became fact, fixed \u2014
p77
aVnecessarily part of my life,
p78
aVand I learned that I could no more reject this fact than reject myself.
p79
aVIt took me a while, but I learned it eventually.
p80
aVNow, another great thing about necessary suffering
p81
aVis that it is the very thing
p82
aVthat unites caregiver and care receiver \u2014
p83
aVhuman beings.
p84
aVThis, we are finally realizing, is where healing happens.
p85
aVYes, compassion \u2014 literally, as we learned yesterday \u2014
p86
aVsuffering together.
p87
aa(lp88
VNow, on the systems side, on the other hand,
p89
aVso much of the suffering is unnecessary, invented.
p90
aVIt serves no good purpose.
p91
aVBut the good news is, since this brand of suffering is made up,
p92
aVwell, we can change it.
p93
aVHow we die is indeed something we can affect.
p94
aVMaking the system sensitive to this fundamental distinction
p95
aVbetween necessary and unnecessary suffering
p96
aVgives us our first of three design cues for the day.
p97
aVAfter all, our role as caregivers, as people who care,
p98
aVis to relieve suffering \u2014 not add to the pile.
p99
aa(lp100
VTrue to the tenets of palliative care,
p101
aVI function as something of a reflective advocate,
p102
aVas much as prescribing physician.
p103
aVQuick aside: palliative care \u2014 a very important field but poorly understood \u2014
p104
aVwhile it includes, it is not limited to end of life care.
p105
aVIt is not limited to hospice.
p106
aVIt's simply about comfort and living well at any stage.
p107
aVSo please know that you don't have to be dying anytime soon
p108
aVto benefit from palliative care.
p109
aa(lp110
VNow, let me introduce you to Frank.
p111
aVSort of makes this point.
p112
aVI've been seeing Frank now for years.
p113
aVHe's living with advancing prostate cancer on top of long-standing HIV.
p114
aVWe work on his bone pain and his fatigue,
p115
aVbut most of the time we spend thinking out loud together about his life \u2014
p116
aVreally, about our lives.
p117
aVIn this way, Frank grieves.
p118
aVIn this way, he keeps up with his losses as they roll in,
p119
aVso that he's ready to take in the next moment.
p120
aVLoss is one thing, but regret, quite another.
p121
aVFrank has always been an adventurer \u2014
p122
aVhe looks like something out of a Norman Rockwell painting \u2014
p123
aVand no fan of regret.
p124
aVSo it wasn't surprising when he came into clinic one day,
p125
aVsaying he wanted to raft down the Colorado River.
p126
aVWas this a good idea?
p127
aVWith all the risks to his safety and his health, some would say no.
p128
aVMany did, but he went for it, while he still could.
p129
aVIt was a glorious, marvelous trip:
p130
aVfreezing water, blistering dry heat, scorpions, snakes,
p131
aVwildlife howling off the flaming walls of the Grand Canyon \u2014
p132
aVall the glorious side of the world beyond our control.
p133
aVFrank's decision, while maybe dramatic,
p134
aVis exactly the kind so many of us would make,
p135
aVif we only had the support to figure out what is best for ourselves over time.
p136
aa(lp137
VSo much of what we're talking about today is a shift in perspective.
p138
aVAfter my accident, when I went back to college,
p139
aVI changed my major to art history.
p140
aVStudying visual art, I figured I'd learn something about how to see \u2014
p141
aVa really potent lesson for a kid who couldn't change
p142
aVso much of what he was seeing.
p143
aVPerspective, that kind of alchemy we humans get to play with,
p144
aVturning anguish into a flower.
p145
aa(lp146
VFlash forward: now I work at an amazing place in San Francisco
p147
aVcalled the Zen Hospice Project,
p148
aVwhere we have a little ritual that helps with this shift in perspective.
p149
aVWhen one of our residents dies,
p150
aVthe mortuary men come, and as we're wheeling the body out through the garden,
p151
aVheading for the gate, we pause.
p152
aVAnyone who wants \u2014
p153
aVfellow residents, family, nurses, volunteers,
p154
aVthe hearse drivers too, now \u2014
p155
aVshares a story or a song or silence,
p156
aVas we sprinkle the body with flower petals.
p157
aVIt takes a few minutes;
p158
aVit's a sweet, simple parting image to usher in grief with warmth,
p159
aVrather than repugnance.
p160
aVContrast that with the typical experience in the hospital setting,
p161
aVmuch like this \u2014 floodlit room lined with tubes and beeping machines
p162
aVand blinking lights that don't stop even when the patient's life has.
p163
aVCleaning crew swoops in, the body's whisked away,
p164
aVand it all feels as though that person had never really existed.
p165
aVWell-intended, of course, in the name of sterility,
p166
aVbut hospitals tend to assault our senses,
p167
aVand the most we might hope for within those walls is numbness \u2014
p168
aVanesthetic, literally the opposite of aesthetic.
p169
aVI revere hospitals for what they can do; I am alive because of them.
p170
aVBut we ask too much of our hospitals.
p171
aVThey are places for acute trauma and treatable illness.
p172
aVThey are no place to live and die; that's not what they were designed for.
p173
aa(lp174
VNow mind you \u2014 I am not giving up on the notion
p175
aVthat our institutions can become more humane.
p176
aVBeauty can be found anywhere.
p177
aVI spent a few months in a burn unit
p178
aVat St. Barnabas Hospital in Livingston, New Jersey,
p179
aVwhere I got really great care at every turn,
p180
aVincluding good palliative care for my pain.
p181
aVAnd one night, it began to snow outside.
p182
aVI remember my nurses complaining about driving through it.
p183
aVAnd there was no window in my room,
p184
aVbut it was great to just imagine it coming down all sticky.
p185
aVNext day, one of my nurses smuggled in a snowball for me.
p186
aVShe brought it in to the unit.
p187
aVI cannot tell you the rapture I felt holding that in my hand,
p188
aVand the coldness dripping onto my burning skin;
p189
aVthe miracle of it all,
p190
aVthe fascination as I watched it melt and turn into water.
p191
aVIn that moment,
p192
aVjust being any part of this planet in this universe mattered more to me
p193
aVthan whether I lived or died.
p194
aVThat little snowball packed all the inspiration I needed
p195
aVto both try to live and be OK if I did not.
p196
aVIn a hospital, that's a stolen moment.
p197
aa(lp198
VIn my work over the years, I've known many people
p199
aVwho were ready to go, ready to die.
p200
aVNot because they had found some final peace or transcendence,
p201
aVbut because they were so repulsed by what their lives had become \u2014
p202
aVin a word, cut off, or ugly.
p203
aVThere are already record numbers of us living with chronic and terminal illness,
p204
aVand into ever older age.
p205
aVAnd we are nowhere near ready or prepared for this silver tsunami.
p206
aVWe need an infrastructure dynamic enough to handle
p207
aVthese seismic shifts in our population.
p208
aVNow is the time to create something new, something vital.
p209
aVI know we can because we have to.
p210
aVThe alternative is just unacceptable.
p211
aVAnd the key ingredients are known:
p212
aVpolicy, education and training,
p213
aVsystems, bricks and mortar.
p214
aVWe have tons of input for designers of all stripes to work with.
p215
aa(lp216
VWe know, for example, from research
p217
aVwhat's most important to people who are closer to death:
p218
aVcomfort; feeling unburdened and unburdening to those they love;
p219
aVexistential peace; and a sense of wonderment and spirituality.
p220
aa(lp221
VOver Zen Hospice's nearly 30 years,
p222
aVwe've learned much more from our residents in subtle detail.
p223
aVLittle things aren't so little.
p224
aVTake Janette.
p225
aVShe finds it harder to breathe one day to the next due to ALS.
p226
aVWell, guess what?
p227
aVShe wants to start smoking again \u2014
p228
aVand French cigarettes, if you please.
p229
aVNot out of some self-destructive bent,
p230
aVbut to feel her lungs filled while she has them.
p231
aVPriorities change.
p232
aVOr Kate \u2014 she just wants to know
p233
aVher dog Austin is lying at the foot of her bed,
p234
aVhis cold muzzle against her dry skin,
p235
aVinstead of more chemotherapy coursing through her veins \u2014
p236
aVshe's done that.
p237
aVSensuous, aesthetic gratification, where in a moment, in an instant,
p238
aVwe are rewarded for just being.
p239
aVSo much of it comes down to loving our time by way of the senses,
p240
aVby way of the body \u2014 the very thing doing the living and the dying.
p241
aa(lp242
VProbably the most poignant room
p243
aVin the Zen Hospice guest house is our kitchen,
p244
aVwhich is a little strange when you realize
p245
aVthat so many of our residents can eat very little, if anything at all.
p246
aVBut we realize we are providing sustenance on several levels:
p247
aVsmell, a symbolic plane.
p248
aVSeriously, with all the heavy-duty stuff happening under our roof,
p249
aVone of the most tried and true interventions we know of,
p250
aVis to bake cookies.
p251
aVAs long as we have our senses \u2014
p252
aVeven just one \u2014
p253
aVwe have at least the possibility of accessing
p254
aVwhat makes us feel human, connected.
p255
aVImagine the ripples of this notion
p256
aVfor the millions of people living and dying with dementia.
p257
aVPrimal sensorial delights that say the things we don't have words for,
p258
aVimpulses that make us stay present \u2014
p259
aVno need for a past or a future.
p260
aa(lp261
VSo, if teasing unnecessary suffering out of the system was our first design cue,
p262
aVthen tending to dignity by way of the senses,
p263
aVby way of the body \u2014 the aesthetic realm \u2014
p264
aVis design cue number two.
p265
aVNow this gets us quickly to the third and final bit for today;
p266
aVnamely, we need to lift our sights, to set our sights on well-being,
p267
aVso that life and health and healthcare
p268
aVcan become about making life more wonderful,
p269
aVrather than just less horrible.
p270
aVBeneficence.
p271
aa(lp272
VHere, this gets right at the distinction
p273
aVbetween a disease-centered and a patient- or human-centered model of care,
p274
aVand here is where caring becomes a creative, generative,
p275
aVeven playful act.
p276
aV"Play" may sound like a funny word here.
p277
aVBut it is also one of our highest forms of adaptation.
p278
aVConsider every major compulsory effort it takes to be human.
p279
aVThe need for food has birthed cuisine.
p280
aVThe need for shelter has given rise to architecture.
p281
aVThe need for cover, fashion.
p282
aVAnd for being subjected to the clock,
p283
aVwell, we invented music.
p284
aVSo, since dying is a necessary part of life,
p285
aVwhat might we create with this fact?
p286
aVBy "play" I am in no way suggesting we take a light approach to dying
p287
aVor that we mandate any particular way of dying.
p288
aVThere are mountains of sorrow that cannot move,
p289
aVand one way or another, we will all kneel there.
p290
aVRather, I am asking that we make space \u2014
p291
aVphysical, psychic room, to allow life to play itself all the way out \u2014
p292
aVso that rather than just getting out of the way,
p293
aVaging and dying can become a process of crescendo through to the end.
p294
aVWe can't solve for death.
p295
aVI know some of you are working on this.
p296
aa(lp297
V(Laughter)
p298
aa(lp299
VMeanwhile, we can \u2014
p300
aa(lp301
V(Laughter)
p302
aa(lp303
VWe can design towards it.
p304
aVParts of me died early on,
p305
aVand that's something we can all say one way or another.
p306
aVI got to redesign my life around this fact,
p307
aVand I tell you it has been a liberation
p308
aVto realize you can always find a shock of beauty or meaning
p309
aVin what life you have left,
p310
aVlike that snowball lasting for a perfect moment,
p311
aVall the while melting away.
p312
aVIf we love such moments ferociously,
p313
aVthen maybe we can learn to live well \u2014
p314
aVnot in spite of death,
p315
aVbut because of it.
p316
aVLet death be what takes us,
p317
aVnot lack of imagination.
p318
