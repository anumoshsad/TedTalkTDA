VI don't know why, but I'm continually amazed to think
p4
aVthat two and a half billion of us around the world
p5
aVare connected to each other through the Internet
p6
aVand that at any point in time
p7
aVmore than 30 percent of the world's population
p8
aVcan go online to learn, to create and to share.
p9
aVAnd the amount of time each of us is spending doing all of this
p10
aVis also continuing to go grow.
p11
aVA recent study showed
p12
aVthat the young generation alone
p13
aVis spending over eight hours a day online.
p14
aVAs the parent of a nine-year-old girl,
p15
aVthat number seems awfully low.
p16
aV(Laughter)
p17
aa(lp18
VBut just as the Internet has opened up the world for each and every one of us,
p19
aVit has also opened up each and every one of us to the world.
p20
aVAnd increasingly, the price we're being asked to pay
p21
aVfor all of this connectedness
p22
aVis our privacy.
p23
aVToday, what many of us would love to believe
p24
aVis that the Internet is a private place; it's not.
p25
aVAnd with every click of the mouse and every touch of the screen,
p26
aVwe are like Hansel and Gretel
p27
aVleaving breadcrumbs of our personal information
p28
aVeverywhere we travel through the digital woods.
p29
aVWe are leaving our birthdays, our places of residence,
p30
aVour interests and preferences,
p31
aVour relationships,
p32
aVour financial histories, and on and on it goes.
p33
aa(lp34
VNow don't get me wrong,
p35
aVI'm not for one minute suggesting that sharing data is a bad thing.
p36
aVIn fact, when I know the data that's being shared
p37
aVand I'm asked explicitly for my consent,
p38
aVI want some sites to understand my habits.
p39
aVIt helps them suggest books for me to read
p40
aVor movies for my family to watch
p41
aVor friends for us to connect with.
p42
aVBut when I don't know and when I haven't been asked,
p43
aVthat's when the problem arises.
p44
aVIt's a phenomenon on the Internet today
p45
aVcalled behavioral tracking,
p46
aVand it is very big business.
p47
aa(lp48
VIn fact, there's an entire industry formed
p49
aVaround following us through the digital woods
p50
aVand compiling a profile on each of us.
p51
aVAnd when all of that data is held,
p52
aVthey can do almost whatever they want with it.
p53
aVThis is an area today that has very few regulations
p54
aVand even fewer rules.
p55
aVExcept for some of the recent announcements here in the United States and in Europe,
p56
aVit's an area of consumer protection that's almost entirely naked.
p57
aa(lp58
VSo let me expose this lurking industry a little bit further.
p59
aVThe visualization you see forming behind me is called Collusion
p60
aVand it's an experimental browser add-on
p61
aVthat you can install in your Firefox browser
p62
aVthat helps you see where your Web data is going and who's tracking you.
p63
aVThe red dots you see up there
p64
aVare sites that are behavioral tracking
p65
aVthat I have not navigated to, but are following me.
p66
aVThe blue dots are the sites that I've actually navigated directly to.
p67
aVAnd the gray dots are sites that are also tracking me,
p68
aVbut I have no idea who they are.
p69
aVAll of them are connected, as you can see,
p70
aVto form a picture of me on the Web.
p71
aVAnd this is my profile.
p72
aa(lp73
VSo let me go from an example to something very specific and personal.
p74
aVI installed Collusion in my own laptop two weeks ago
p75
aVand I let it follow me around for what was a pretty typical day.
p76
aVNow like most of you,
p77
aVI actually start my day going online and checking email.
p78
aVI then go to a news site, look for some headlines.
p79
aVAnd in this particular case I happened to like one of them
p80
aVon the merits of music literacy in schools
p81
aVand I shared it over a social network.
p82
aa(lp83
VOur daughter then joined us at the breakfast table,
p84
aVand I asked her, "Is there an emphasis on music literacy in your school?"
p85
aVAnd she, of course, naturally as a nine-year-old,
p86
aVlooked at me and said quizzically, "What's literacy?"
p87
aVSo I sent her online, of course, to look it up.
p88
aVNow let me stop here.
p89
aVWe are not even two bites into breakfast
p90
aVand there are already nearly 25 sites that are tracking me.
p91
aVI have navigated to a total of four.
p92
aa(lp93
VSo let me fast-forward through the rest of my day.
p94
aVI go to work, I check email,
p95
aVI log onto a few more social sites, I blog,
p96
aVI check more news reports, I share some of those news reports,
p97
aVI go look at some videos,
p98
aVpretty typical day \u2014 in this case, actually fairly pedantic \u2014
p99
aVand at the end of the day, as my day winds down,
p100
aVlook at my profile.
p101
aVThe red dots have exploded.
p102
aVThe gray dots have grown exponentially.
p103
aVAll in all, there's over 150 sites
p104
aVthat are now tracking my personal information,
p105
aVmost all of them without my consent.
p106
aa(lp107
VI look at this picture and it freaks me out.
p108
aVThis is nothing. I am being stalked across the Web.
p109
aVAnd why is this happening?
p110
aVPretty simple \u2014 it's huge business.
p111
aVThe revenue of the top handful of companies in this space
p112
aVis over 39 billion dollars today.
p113
aVAnd as adults, we're certainly not alone.
p114
aVAt the same time I installed my own Collusion profile,
p115
aVI installed one for my daughter.
p116
aVAnd on one single Saturday morning, over two hours on the Internet,
p117
aVhere's her Collusion profile.
p118
aa(lp119
VThis is a nine-year-old girl
p120
aVnavigating to principally children's sites.
p121
aVI move from this, from freaked out to enraged.
p122
aVThis is no longer me being a tech pioneer or a privacy advocate;
p123
aVthis is me being a parent.
p124
aVImagine in the physical world
p125
aVif somebody followed our children around with a camera and a notebook
p126
aVand recorded their every movement.
p127
aVI can tell you, there isn't a person in this room that would sit idly by.
p128
aVWe'd take action. It may not be good action, but we would take action.
p129
aV(Laughter)
p130
aVWe can't sit idly by here either.
p131
aVThis is happening today.
p132
aa(lp133
VPrivacy is not an option,
p134
aVand it shouldn't be the price we accept
p135
aVfor just getting on the Internet.
p136
aVOur voices matter and our actions matter even more.
p137
aa(lp138
VToday we've launched Collusion.
p139
aVYou can download it, install it in Firefox,
p140
aVto see who is tracking you across the Web
p141
aVand following you through the digital woods.
p142
aVGoing forward, all of our voices need to be heard.
p143
aVBecause what we don't know can actually hurt us.
p144
aVBecause the memory of the Internet is forever.
p145
aVWe are being watched.
p146
aVIt's now time for us to watch the watchers.
p147
aa(lp148
VThank you.
