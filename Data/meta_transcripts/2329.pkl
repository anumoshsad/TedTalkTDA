VI'm here to recruit men to support gender equality.
p4
aa(lp5
V(Cheers)
p6
aa(lp7
VWait, wait. What?
p8
aVWhat do men have to do with gender equality?
p9
aVGender equality is about women, right?
p10
aVI mean, the word gender is about women.
p11
aVActually, I'm even here speaking as a middle class white man.
p12
aa(lp13
VNow, I wasn't always a middle class white man.
p14
aVIt all happened for me about 30 years ago when I was in graduate school,
p15
aVand a bunch of us graduate students got together one day,
p16
aVand we said, you know, there's an explosion
p17
aVof writing and thinking in feminist theory,
p18
aVbut there's no courses yet.
p19
aVSo we did what graduate students typically do in a situation like that.
p20
aVWe said, OK, let's have a study group.
p21
aVWe'll read a text, we'll talk about it,
p22
aVwe'll have a potluck dinner.
p23
aa(lp24
V(Laughter)
p25
aa(lp26
VSo every week, 11 women and me got together.
p27
aa(lp28
V(Laughter)
p29
aa(lp30
VWe would read some text in feminist theory and have a conversation about it.
p31
aVAnd during one of our conversations,
p32
aVI witnessed an interaction that changed my life forever.
p33
aVIt was a conversation between two women.
p34
aVOne of the women was white, and one was black.
p35
aVAnd the white woman said \u2014
p36
aVthis is going to sound very anachronistic now \u2014
p37
aVthe white woman said, "All women face the same oppression as women.
p38
aVAll women are similarly situated in patriarchy,
p39
aVand therefore all women have a kind of intuitive solidarity or sisterhood."
p40
aVAnd the black woman said, "I'm not so sure.
p41
aVLet me ask you a question."
p42
aVSo the black woman says to the white woman,
p43
aV"When you wake up in the morning and you look in the mirror,
p44
aVwhat do you see?"
p45
aVAnd the white woman said, "I see a woman."
p46
aVAnd the black woman said, "You see, that's the problem for me.
p47
aVBecause when I wake up in the morning and I look in the mirror," she said,
p48
aV"I see a black woman.
p49
aVTo me, race is visible. But to you, race is invisible. You don't see it."
p50
aVAnd then she said something really startling.
p51
aVShe said, "That's how privilege works.
p52
aVPrivilege is invisible to those who have it."
p53
aVIt is a luxury, I will say to the white people sitting in this room,
p54
aVnot to have to think about race every split second of our lives.
p55
aVPrivilege is invisible to those who have it.
p56
aa(lp57
VNow remember, I was the only man in this group,
p58
aVso when I witnessed this, I went, "Oh no."
p59
aa(lp60
V(Laughter)
p61
aa(lp62
VAnd somebody said, "Well what was that reaction?"
p63
aVAnd I said, "Well, when I wake up in the morning and I look in the mirror,
p64
aVI see a human being.
p65
aVI'm kind of the generic person.
p66
aVYou know, I'm a middle class white man. I have no race, no class, no gender.
p67
aVI'm universally generalizable."
p68
aa(lp69
V(Laughter)
p70
aa(lp71
VSo I like to think that was the moment I became a middle class white man,
p72
aVthat class and race and gender were not about other people,
p73
aVthey were about me.
p74
aVI had to start thinking about them,
p75
aVand it had been privilege that had kept it invisible to me for so long.
p76
aa(lp77
VNow, I wish I could tell you this story ends 30 years ago
p78
aVin that little discussion group,
p79
aVbut I was reminded of it quite recently at my university where I teach.
p80
aVI have a colleague, and she and I both teach the sociology of gender course
p81
aVon alternate semesters.
p82
aVSo she gives a guest lecture for me when I teach.
p83
aVI give a guest lecture for her when she teaches.
p84
aVSo I walk into her class to give a guest lecture,
p85
aVabout 300 students in the room,
p86
aVand as I walk in, one of the students looks up and says,
p87
aV"Oh, finally, an objective opinion."
p88
aa(lp89
VAll that semester, whenever my colleague opened her mouth,
p90
aVwhat my students saw was a woman.
p91
aVI mean, if you were to say to my students,
p92
aV"There is structural inequality based on gender in the United States,"
p93
aVthey'd say, "Well of course you'd say that.
p94
aVYou're a woman. You're biased."
p95
aVWhen I say it, they go, "Wow, is that interesting.
p96
aVIs that going to be on the test? How do you spell 'structural'?"
p97
aa(lp98
V(Laughter)
p99
aa(lp100
VSo I hope you all can see,
p101
aVthis is what objectivity looks like.
p102
aa(lp103
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p104
aa(lp105
VDisembodied Western rationality.
p106
aa(lp107
V(Laughter)
p108
aa(lp109
VAnd that, by the way, is why I think men so often wear ties.
p110
aa(lp111
V(Laughter)
p112
aa(lp113
VBecause if you are going to embody disembodied Western rationality,
p114
aVyou need a signifier,
p115
aVand what could be a better signifier of disembodied Western rationality
p116
aVthan a garment that at one end is a noose and the other end points to the genitals?
p117
aa(lp118
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p119
aa(lp120
VThat is mind-body dualism right there.
p121
aa(lp122
VSo making gender visible to men
p123
aVis the first step to engaging men to support gender equality.
p124
aa(lp125
VNow, when men first hear about gender equality,
p126
aVwhen they first start thinking about it,
p127
aVthey often think, many men think,
p128
aVwell, that's right, that's fair, that's just,
p129
aVthat's the ethical imperative.
p130
aVBut not all men.
p131
aVSome men think \u2014 the lightning bolt goes off,
p132
aVand they go, "Oh my God, yes, gender equality,"
p133
aVand they will immediately begin to mansplain to you your oppression.
p134
aVThey see supporting gender equality something akin to the cavalry,
p135
aVlike, "Thanks very much for bringing this to our attention, ladies,
p136
aVwe'll take it from here."
p137
aVThis results in a syndrome that I like to call 'premature self-congratulation.'
p138
aa(lp139
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p140
aa(lp141
VThere's another group, though, that actively resists gender equality,
p142
aVthat sees gender equality as something that is detrimental to men.
p143
aVI was on a TV talk show opposite four white men.
p144
aVThis is the beginning of the book I wrote, 'Angry White Men.'
p145
aVThese were four angry white men
p146
aVwho believed that they, white men in America,
p147
aVwere the victims of reverse discrimination in the workplace.
p148
aVAnd they all told stories about how they were qualified for jobs,
p149
aVqualified for promotions,
p150
aVthey didn't get them, they were really angry.
p151
aVAnd the reason I'm telling you this is I want you to hear the title
p152
aVof this particular show.
p153
aVIt was a quote from one of the men,
p154
aVand the quote was,
p155
aV"A Black Woman Stole My Job."
p156
aVAnd they all told their stories,
p157
aVqualified for jobs, qualified for promotions,
p158
aVdidn't get it, really angry.
p159
aVAnd then it was my turn to speak,
p160
aVand I said, "I have just one question for you guys,
p161
aVand it's about the title of the show,
p162
aV'A Black Woman Stole My Job.'
p163
aVActually, it's about one word in the title.
p164
aVI want to know about the word 'my.'
p165
aVWhere did you get the idea it was your job?
p166
aVWhy isn't the title of the show, 'A Black Woman Got the Job?'
p167
aVor 'A Black Woman Got A Job?'"
p168
aVBecause without confronting men's sense of entitlement,
p169
aVI don't think we'll ever understand why so many men resist gender equality.
p170
aa(lp171
V(Applause)
p172
aa(lp173
VLook, we think this is a level playing field,
p174
aVso any policy that tilts it even a little bit,
p175
aVwe think, "Oh my God, water's rushing uphill.
p176
aVIt's reverse discrimination against us."
p177
aa(lp178
V(Laughter)
p179
aa(lp180
VSo let me be very clear:
p181
aVwhite men in Europe and the United States
p182
aVare the beneficiaries of the single greatest affirmative action program
p183
aVin the history of the world.
p184
aVIt is called "the history of the world."
p185
aa(lp186
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p187
aa(lp188
VSo, now I've established some of the obstacles to engaging men,
p189
aVbut why should we support gender equality?
p190
aVOf course, it's fair, it's right and it's just.
p191
aVBut more than that,
p192
aVgender equality is also in our interest as men.
p193
aVIf you listen to what men say about what they want in their lives,
p194
aVgender equality is actually a way for us to get the lives we want to live.
p195
aa(lp196
VGender equality is good for countries.
p197
aVIt turns out, according to most studies,
p198
aVthat those countries that are the most gender equal
p199
aVare also the countries that score highest on the happiness scale.
p200
aVAnd that's not just because they're all in Europe.
p201
aa(lp202
V(Laughter)
p203
aa(lp204
VEven within Europe, those countries that are more gender equal
p205
aValso have the highest levels of happiness.
p206
aa(lp207
VIt is also good for companies.
p208
aVResearch by Catalyst and others has shown conclusively
p209
aVthat the more gender-equal companies are,
p210
aVthe better it is for workers,
p211
aVthe happier their labor force is.
p212
aVThey have lower job turnover. They have lower levels of attrition.
p213
aVThey have an easier time recruiting.
p214
aVThey have higher rates of retention, higher job satisfaction,
p215
aVhigher rates of productivity.
p216
aVSo the question I'm often asked in companies is,
p217
aV"Boy, this gender equality thing, that's really going to be expensive, huh?"
p218
aVAnd I say, "Oh no, in fact, what you have to start calculating
p219
aVis how much gender inequality is already costing you.
p220
aVIt is extremely expensive."
p221
aVSo it is good for business.
p222
aa(lp223
VAnd the other thing is, it's good for men.
p224
aVIt is good for the kind of lives we want to live,
p225
aVbecause young men especially have changed enormously,
p226
aVand they want to have lives that are animated
p227
aVby terrific relationships with their children.
p228
aVThey expect their partners, their spouses, their wives,
p229
aVto work outside the home
p230
aVand be just as committed to their careers as they are.
p231
aa(lp232
VI was talking, to give you an illustration of this change \u2014
p233
aVSome of you may remember this.
p234
aVWhen I was a lot younger, there was a riddle that was posed to us.
p235
aVSome of you may wince to remember this riddle.
p236
aVThis riddle went something like this.
p237
aa(lp238
VA man and his son are driving on the freeway,
p239
aVand they're in a terrible accident,
p240
aVand the father is killed,
p241
aVand the son is brought to the hospital emergency room,
p242
aVand as they're bringing the son into the hospital emergency room,
p243
aVthe emergency room attending physician sees the boy and says,
p244
aV"Oh, I can't treat him, that's my son."
p245
aVHow is this possible?
p246
aa(lp247
VWe were flummoxed by this.
p248
aVWe could not figure this out.
p249
aa(lp250
V(Laughter)
p251
aa(lp252
VWell, I decided to do a little experiment with my 16-year old son.
p253
aVHe had a bunch of his friends hanging out at the house
p254
aVwatching a game on TV recently.
p255
aVSo I decided I would pose this riddle to them,
p256
aVjust to see, to gauge the level of change.
p257
aVWell, 16-year-old boys,
p258
aVthey immediately turned to me and said, "It's his mom." Right?
p259
aVNo problem. Just like that.
p260
aVExcept for my son, who said, "Well, he could have two dads."
p261
aa(lp262
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p263
aa(lp264
VThat's an index, an indicator of how things have changed.
p265
aVYounger men today expect to be able to balance work and family.
p266
aVThey want to be dual-career, dual-carer couples.
p267
aVThey want to be able to balance work and family with their partners.
p268
aVThey want to be involved fathers.
p269
aa(lp270
VNow, it turns out
p271
aVthat the more egalitarian our relationships,
p272
aVthe happier both partners are.
p273
aVData from psychologists and sociologists are quite persuasive here.
p274
aVI think we have the persuasive numbers, the data, to prove to men
p275
aVthat gender equality is not a zero-sum game, but a win-win.
p276
aVHere's what the data show.
p277
aVNow, when men begin the process of engaging
p278
aVwith balancing work and family,
p279
aVwe often have two phrases that we use to describe what we do.
p280
aVWe pitch in and we help out.
p281
aa(lp282
V(Laughter)
p283
aa(lp284
VAnd I'm going to propose something a little bit more radical,
p285
aVone word: "share."
p286
aa(lp287
V(Laughter)
p288
aa(lp289
VBecause here's what the data show:
p290
aVwhen men share housework and childcare,
p291
aVtheir children do better in school.
p292
aVTheir children have lower rates of absenteeism,
p293
aVhigher rates of achievement.
p294
aVThey are less likely to be diagnosed with ADHD.
p295
aVThey are less likely to see a child psychiatrist.
p296
aVThey are less likely to be put on medication.
p297
aa(lp298
VSo when men share housework and childcare,
p299
aVtheir children are happier and healthier,
p300
aVand men want this.
p301
aa(lp302
VWhen men share housework and childcare,
p303
aVtheir wives are happier. Duh.
p304
aVNot only that, their wives are healthier.
p305
aVTheir wives are less likely to see a therapist,
p306
aVless likely to be diagnosed with depression,
p307
aVless likely to be put on medication, more likely to go to the gym,
p308
aVreport higher levels of marital satisfaction.
p309
aVSo when men share housework and childcare,
p310
aVtheir wives are happier and healthier,
p311
aVand men certainly want this as well.
p312
aVWhen men share housework and childcare,
p313
aVthe men are healthier.
p314
aVThey smoke less, drink less, take recreational drugs less often.
p315
aVThey are less likely to go to the ER
p316
aVbut more like to go to a doctor for routine screenings.
p317
aVThey are less likely to see a therapist,
p318
aVless likely to be diagnosed with depression,
p319
aVless likely to be taking prescription medication.
p320
aVSo when men share housework and childcare,
p321
aVthe men are happier and healthier.
p322
aVAnd who wouldn't want that?
p323
aa(lp324
VAnd finally,
p325
aVwhen men share housework and childcare,
p326
aVthey have more sex.
p327
aa(lp328
V(Laughter)
p329
aa(lp330
VNow, of these four fascinating findings,
p331
aVwhich one do you think Men's Health magazine put on its cover?
p332
aa(lp333
V(Laughter)
p334
aa(lp335
V"Housework Makes Her Horny.
p336
aV(Not When She Does It.)"
p337
aa(lp338
V(Laughter)
p339
aa(lp340
VNow, I will say,
p341
aVjust to remind the men in the audience,
p342
aVthese data were collected over a really long period of time,
p343
aVso I don't want listeners to say,
p344
aV"Hmm, OK, I think I'll do the dishes tonight."
p345
aVThese data were collected over a really long period of time.
p346
aVBut I think it shows something important,
p347
aVthat when Men's Health magazine put it on their cover,
p348
aVthey also called, you'll love this, "Choreplay."
p349
aa(lp350
VSo, what we found is something really important,
p351
aVthat gender equality
p352
aVis in the interest of countries,
p353
aVof companies, and of men,
p354
aVand their children and their partners,
p355
aVthat gender equality is not a zero-sum game.
p356
aVIt's not a win-lose.
p357
aVIt is a win-win for everyone.
p358
aVAnd what we also know
p359
aVis we cannot fully empower women and girls
p360
aVunless we engage boys and men.
p361
aVWe know this.
p362
aVAnd my position is
p363
aVthat men need the very things that women have identified
p364
aVthat they need to live the lives they say they want to live
p365
aVin order to live the lives that we say we want to live.
p366
aa(lp367
VIn 1915, on the eve of one of the great suffrage demonstrations
p368
aVdown Fifth Avenue in New York City,
p369
aVa writer in New York wrote an article in a magazine,
p370
aVand the title of the article was,
p371
aV"Feminism for Men."
p372
aVAnd this was the first line of that article:
p373
aV"Feminism will make it possible for the first time for men to be free."
