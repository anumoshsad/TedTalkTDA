VOn simplicity. What a great way to start.
p4
aVFirst of all, I've been watching this trend
p5
aVwhere we have these books like such and such "For Dummies."
p6
aVDo you know these books, these such and such "For Dummies?"
p7
aVMy daughters pointed out that I'm very similar looking, so this is a bit of a problem.
p8
aV(Laughter)
p9
aVBut I was looking online at Amazon.com for other books like this.
p10
aVYou know, there's also something called the "Complete Idiot's Guide?"
p11
aVThere's a sort of business model around being stupid in some sense.
p12
aVWe like to have technology make us feel bad, for some strange reason.
p13
aa(lp14
VBut I really like that, so I wrote a book called "The Laws of Simplicity."
p15
aVI was in Milan last week, for the Italian launch.
p16
aVIt's kind of a book about questions, questions about simplicity.
p17
aVVery few answers. I'm also wondering myself, what is simplicity?
p18
aVIs it good? Is it bad? Is complexity better? I'm not sure.
p19
aa(lp20
VAfter I wrote "The Laws of Simplicity,"
p21
aVI was very tired of simplicity, as you can imagine.
p22
aVAnd so in my life, I've discovered that
p23
aVvacation is the most important skill for any kind of over-achiever.
p24
aVBecause your companies will always take away your life,
p25
aVbut they can never take away your vacation \u2014 in theory.
p26
aV(Laughter)
p27
aa(lp28
VSo, I went to the Cape last summer to hide from simplicity,
p29
aVand I went to the Gap, because I only have black pants.
p30
aVSo I went and bought khaki shorts or whatever,
p31
aVand unfortunately, their branding was all about "Keep It Simple."
p32
aV(Laughter)
p33
aVI opened up a magazine, and Visa's branding was,
p34
aV"Business Takes Simplicity."
p35
aVI develop photographs, and Kodak said, "Keep It Simple."
p36
aVSo, I felt kind of weird that simplicity was sort of following me around.
p37
aa(lp38
VSo, I turned on the TV, and I don't watch TV very much,
p39
aVbut you know this person? This is Paris Hilton, apparently.
p40
aVAnd she has this show, "The Simple Life."
p41
aVSo I watched this. It's not very simple, a little bit confusing.
p42
aV(Laughter)
p43
aVSo, I looked for a different show to watch.
p44
aVSo, I opened up this TV Guide thing,
p45
aVand on the E! channel, this "Simple Life" show is very popular.
p46
aVThey'll play it over, and over, and over.
p47
aV(Laughter)
p48
aVSo it was traumatizing, actually.
p49
aa(lp50
VSo, I wanted to escape again, so I went out to my car.
p51
aVAnd Cape Cod, there are idyllic roads, and all of us can drive in this room.
p52
aVAnd when you drive, these signs are very important.
p53
aVIt's a very simple sign, it says, "road" and "road approaching."
p54
aVSo I'm mostly driving along, okay, and then I saw this sign.
p55
aV(Laughter)
p56
aVSo, I thought complexity was attacking me suddenly,
p57
aVso I thought, "Ah, simplicity. Very important."
p58
aa(lp59
VBut then I thought, "Oh, simplicity. What would that be like on a beach?
p60
aVWhat if the sky was 41 percent gray? Wouldn't that be the perfect sky?"
p61
aVI mean that simplicity sky.
p62
aVBut in reality, the sky looked like this. It was a beautiful, complex sky.
p63
aa(lp64
VYou know, with the pinks and blues. We can't help but love complexity.
p65
aVWe're human beings: we love complex things.
p66
aVWe love relationships \u2014 very complex. So we love this kind of stuff.
p67
aa(lp68
VI'm at this place called the Media Lab.
p69
aVMaybe some of you guys have heard of this place.
p70
aVIt's designed by I. M. Pei, one of the premier modernist architects.
p71
aVModernism means white box, and it's a perfect white box.
p72
aV(Laughter)
p73
aVAnd some of you guys are entrepreneurs, etc., whatever.
p74
aVLast month, I was at Google, and, boy, that cafeteria, man.
p75
aVYou guys have things here in Silicon Valley like stock options.
p76
aVSee, in academia, we get titles, lots of titles.
p77
aa(lp78
VLast year at TED, these were all my titles. I had a lot of titles.
p79
aVI have a default title as a father of a bunch of daughters.
p80
aVThis year at TED, I'm happy to report that I have new titles,
p81
aVin addition to my previous titles.
p82
aVAnother "Associate Director of Research."
p83
aVAnd this also happened, so I have five daughters now.
p84
aV(Laughter)
p85
aVThat's my baby Reina. (Applause) Thank you.
p86
aVAnd so, my life is much more complex because of the baby, actually,
p87
aVbut that's okay. We will still stay married, I think.
p88
aa(lp89
VBut looking way back, when I was a child \u2014
p90
aVyou see, I grew up in a tofu factory in Seattle.
p91
aVMany of you may not like tofu because you haven't had good tofu,
p92
aVbut tofu's a good food. It's a very simple kind of food.
p93
aVIt's very hard work to make tofu.
p94
aVAs a child, we used to wake up at 1 a.m. and work till 6 p.m., six days a week.
p95
aVMy father was kind of like Andy Grove, paranoid of the competition.
p96
aVSo often, seven days a week. Family business equals child labor.
p97
aa(lp98
VWe were a great model. So, I loved going to school.
p99
aVSchool was great, and maybe going to school
p100
aVhelped me get to this Media Lab place, I'm not sure.
p101
aV(Laughter)
p102
aVThank you.
p103
aVBut the Media Lab is an interesting place, and it's important to me
p104
aVbecause as a student, I was a computer science undergrad,
p105
aVand I discovered design later on in my life.
p106
aa(lp107
VAnd there was this person, Muriel Cooper.
p108
aVWho knows Muriel Cooper? Muriel Cooper?
p109
aVWasn't she amazing? Muriel Cooper. She was wacky.
p110
aVAnd she was a TEDster, exactly, and she showed us,
p111
aVshe showed the world how to make the computer beautiful again.
p112
aVAnd she's very important in my life,
p113
aVbecause she's the one that told me to leave MIT and go to art school.
p114
aVIt was the best advice I ever got. So I went to art school, because of her.
p115
aVShe passed away in 1994,
p116
aVand I was hired back to MIT to try to fill her shoes, but it's so hard.
p117
aVThis amazing person, Muriel Cooper.
p118
aa(lp119
VWhen I was in Japan \u2014 I went to an art school in Japan \u2014
p120
aVI had a nice sort of situation, because somehow I was connected to Paul Rand.
p121
aVSome of you guys know Paul Rand,
p122
aVthe greatest graphic designer \u2014 I'm sorry \u2014 out there.
p123
aVThe great graphic designer Paul Rand
p124
aVdesigned the IBM logo, the Westinghouse logo.
p125
aVHe basically said, "I've designed everything."
p126
aVAnd also Ikko Tanaka was a very important mentor in my life \u2014
p127
aVthe Paul Rand of Japan. He designed most of the major icons of Japan,
p128
aVlike Issey Miyake's brand and also Muji.
p129
aa(lp130
VWhen you have mentors \u2014 and yesterday,
p131
aVKareem Abdul-Jabbar talked about mentors,
p132
aVthese people in your life \u2014 the problem with mentors is that they all die.
p133
aVThis is a sad thing, but it's actually a happy thing in a way,
p134
aVbecause you can remember them in their pure form.
p135
aVI think that the mentors that we all meet sort of humanize us.
p136
aVWhen you get older, and you're all freaked out, whatever,
p137
aVthe mentors calm us down.
p138
aVAnd I'm grateful for my mentors, and I'm sure all of you are too.
p139
aa(lp140
VBecause the human thing is very hard when you're at MIT.
p141
aVThe T doesn't stand for "human," it stands for "technology."
p142
aVAnd because of that, I always wondered about this human thing.
p143
aVSo, I've always been Googling this word, "human,"
p144
aVto find out how many hits I get.
p145
aVAnd in 2001, I had 26 million hits, and for "computer,"
p146
aVbecause computers are against humans a bit,
p147
aa(lp148
VI have 42 million hits. Let me do an Al Gore here.
p149
aVSo, if you sort of compare that, like this,
p150
aVyou'll see that computer versus human \u2014
p151
aVI've been tracking this for the last year \u2014
p152
aVcomputer versus human over the last year has changed.
p153
aVIt used to be kind of two to one. Now, humans are catching up.
p154
aVVery good, us humans! We're catching up with the computers.
p155
aVIn the simplicity realm, it's also interesting.
p156
aVSo if you compare complexities to simplicity,
p157
aVit's also catching up in a way, too.
p158
aVSo, somehow humans and simplicity are intertwined, I think.
p159
aa(lp160
VI have a confession: I'm not a man of simplicity.
p161
aVI spent my entire early career making complex stuff.
p162
aVLots of complex stuff.
p163
aVI wrote computer programs to make complex graphics like this.
p164
aVI had clients in Japan to make really complex stuff like this.
p165
aVAnd I've always felt bad about it, in a sense.
p166
aVSo, I hid in a time dimension.
p167
aVI built things in a time-graphics dimension.
p168
aVI did this series of calendars for Shiseido.
p169
aVThis is a floral theme calendar in 1997,
p170
aVand this is a firework calendar. So, you launch the number into space,
p171
aVbecause the Japanese believe that when you see fireworks,
p172
aVyou're cooler for some reason.
p173
aVThis is why they have fireworks in the summer.
p174
aVA very extreme culture.
p175
aVLastly, this is a fall-based calendar,
p176
aVbecause I have so many leaves in my yard.
p177
aVSo this is the leaves in my yard, essentially.
p178
aa(lp179
VAnd so I made a lot of these types of things.
p180
aVI've been lucky to have been there before people made these kind of things,
p181
aVand so I made all this kind of stuff that messes with your eyes.
p182
aVI feel kind of bad about that.
p183
aVTomorrow, Paola Antonelli is speaking. I love Paola.
p184
aVShe has this show right now at MoMA,
p185
aVwhere some of these early works are here on display at MoMA, on the walls.
p186
aVIf you're in New York, please go and see that.
p187
aa(lp188
VBut I've had a problem, because I make all this flying stuff
p189
aVand people say, "Oh, I know your work.
p190
aVYou're the guy that makes eye candy."
p191
aVAnd when you're told this, you feel kind of weird.
p192
aV"Eye candy" \u2014 sort of pejorative, don't you think?
p193
aVSo, I say, "No, I make eye meat," instead.
p194
aV(Laughter)
p195
aVAnd eye meat is something different, something more fibrous,
p196
aVsomething more powerful, perhaps. But what could that be, eye meat?
p197
aa(lp198
VI've been interested in computer programs all my life, actually.
p199
aVComputer programs are essentially trees,
p200
aVand when you make art with a computer program, there's kind of a problem.
p201
aVWhenever you make art with a computer program,
p202
aVyou're always on the tree, and the paradox is that
p203
aVfor excellent art, you want to be off the tree.
p204
aVSo, this is sort of a complication I've found.
p205
aa(lp206
VSo, to get off the tree, I began to use my old computers.
p207
aVI took these to Tokyo in 2001 to make computer objects.
p208
aVThis is a new way to type, on my old, color Classic.
p209
aVYou can't type very much on this.
p210
aVI also discovered that an IR mouse responds to CRT emissions
p211
aVand starts to move by itself, so this is a self-drawing machine.
p212
aVAnd also, one year, the G3 Bondi Blue thing \u2014
p213
aVthat caddy would come out, like, dangerous, like, "whack," like that.
p214
aVBut I thought, "This is very interesting. What if I make like a car crash test?"
p215
aVSo I have a crash test.
p216
aV(Laughter)
p217
aVAnd sort of measure the impact. Stuff like this are things I made,
p218
aVjust to sort of understand what these things are.
p219
aV(Laughter)
p220
aa(lp221
VShortly after this, 9/11 happened, and I was very depressed.
p222
aVI was concerned with contemporary art
p223
aVthat was all about piss, and sort of really sad things,
p224
aVand so I wanted to think about something happy.
p225
aVSo I focused on food as my area \u2014
p226
aVthese sort of clementine peel things.
p227
aVIn Japan, it's a wonderful thing to remove the clementine peel
p228
aVjust in one piece. Who's done that before? One-piece clementine?
p229
aVOh, you guys are missing out, if you haven't done it yet.
p230
aVIt was very good, and I discovered I can make sculptures out of this,
p231
aVactually, in different forms.
p232
aVIf you dry them quick, you can make, like, elephants and steers and stuff,
p233
aVand my wife didn't like these, because they mold, so I had to stop that.
p234
aa(lp235
VSo, I went back to the computer, and I bought five large fries,
p236
aVand scanned them all. And I was looking for some kind of food theme,
p237
aVand I wrote some software to automatically lay out french-fry images.
p238
aVAnd as a child, I'd hear that song, you know,
p239
aV"Oh, beautiful, for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain,"
p240
aVso I made this amber waves image.
p241
aVIt's sort of a Midwest cornfield out of french fries.
p242
aa(lp243
VAnd also, as a child, I was the fattest kid in class,
p244
aVso I used to love Cheetos. Oh, I love Cheetos, yummy.
p245
aVSo, I wanted to play with Cheetos in some way.
p246
aVI wasn't sure where to go with this. I invented Cheeto paint.
p247
aVCheeto paint is a very simple way to paint with Cheetos.
p248
aV(Laughter)
p249
aVI discovered that Cheetos are good, expressive material.
p250
aVAnd with these Cheetos, I began to think,
p251
aV"What can I make with these Cheetos?"
p252
aa(lp253
VAnd so, I began to crinkle up potato chip flecks, and also pretzels.
p254
aVI was looking for some kind of form,
p255
aVand in the end, I made 100 butter-fries. Do you get it?
p256
aV(Laughter)
p257
aVAnd each butter-fry is composed of different pieces.
p258
aVPeople ask me how they make the antenna.
p259
aVSometimes, they find a hair in the food. That's my hair.
p260
aVMy hair's clean \u2014 it's okay.
p261
aa(lp262
VI'm a tenured professor, which means, basically, I don't have to work anymore.
p263
aVIt's a strange business model. I can come into work everyday
p264
aVand staple five pieces of paper and just stare at it with my latte.
p265
aVEnd of story.
p266
aV(Laughter)
p267
aVBut I realized that life could be very boring,
p268
aVso I've been thinking about life, and I notice that my camera \u2014
p269
aVmy digital camera versus my car, a very strange thing.
p270
aVThe car is so big, the camera is so small,
p271
aVyet the manual for the camera is so much bigger than the car manual.
p272
aVIt doesn't make any sense.
p273
aV(Laughter)
p274
aa(lp275
VSo, I was in the Cape one time, and I typed the word "simplicity,"
p276
aVand I discovered, in this weird, M. Night Shyamalan way,
p277
aVthat I discovered [the] letters, M, I, T. You know the word?
p278
aVIn the words "simplicity" and "complexity," M, I, T occur in perfect sequence.
p279
aVIt's a bit eerie, isn't it?
p280
aVSo, I thought, maybe I'll do this for the next twenty years or something.
p281
aa(lp282
VAnd I wrote this book, "The Laws of Simplicity."
p283
aVIt's a very short, simple book. There are ten laws and three keys.
p284
aVThe ten laws and three keys \u2014 I won't go over them because that's why I have a book,
p285
aVand also that's why it's on the Web for free.
p286
aVBut the laws are kind of like sushi in a way: there are all kinds.
p287
aVIn Japan, they say that sushi is challenging.
p288
aVYou know the uni is the most challenging, so number ten is challenging.
p289
aVPeople hate number ten like they hate uni, actually.
p290
aVThe three keys are easy to eat, so this is anago, cooked already, so easy to eat.
p291
aVSo enjoy your sushi meal later, with the laws of simplicity.
p292
aVBecause I want to simplify them for you.
p293
aVBecause that's what this is about. I have to simplify this thing.
p294
aa(lp295
VSo, if I simplify the laws of simplicity,
p296
aVI have what's called the cookie versus laundry thing.
p297
aVAnyone who has kids knows that if you offer a kid
p298
aVa big cookie or a small cookie,
p299
aVwhich cookie are they going to take? The big cookie.
p300
aVYou can say the small cookie has Godiva chocolate bits in it,
p301
aVbut it doesn't work. They want the big cookie.
p302
aVBut if you offer kids two piles of laundry to fold,
p303
aVthe small pile or the big pile, which will they choose?
p304
aa(lp305
VStrangely, not the big pile. So, I think it's as simple as this.
p306
aVYou know, when you want more, it's because you want to enjoy it.
p307
aVWhen you want less, it's because it's about work.
p308
aVAnd so, to boil it all down, simplicity is about living life
p309
aVwith more enjoyment and less pain.
p310
aVI think this is sort of simple more versus less.
p311
aVBasically, it always depends.
p312
aVThis book I wrote because I want to figure out life.
p313
aVI love life. I love being alive. I like to see things.
p314
aVAnd so life is a big question, I think, in simplicity,
p315
aVbecause you're trying to simplify your life.
p316
aa(lp317
VAnd I just love to see the world. The world is an amazing place.
p318
aVBy being at TED, we see so many things at one time.
p319
aVAnd I can't help but enjoy looking at everything in the world.
p320
aVLike everything you see, every time you wake up.
p321
aVIt's such a joy to sort of experience everything in the world.
p322
aVFrom everything from a weird hotel lobby,
p323
aVto Saran wrap placed over your window,
p324
aVto this moment where I had my road in front of my house paved dark black,
p325
aVand this white moth was sitting there dying in the sun.
p326
aa(lp327
VAnd so, this whole thing has struck me as exciting to be here,
p328
aVbecause life is finite.
p329
aVThis was given to me by the chairman of Shiseido.
p330
aVHe's an expert in aging. This horizontal axis is how old you are \u2014
p331
aVtwelve years old, twenty-four years old, seventy-four, ninety-six years old \u2014
p332
aVand this is some medical data. So, brain strength increases up to 60,
p333
aVand then after 60, it sort of goes down. Kind of depressing in a way.
p334
aa(lp335
VAlso, if you look at your physical strength.
p336
aVYou know, I have a lot of cocky freshmen at MIT, so I tell them,
p337
aV"Oh, your bodies are really getting stronger and stronger,
p338
aVbut in your late twenties and mid-thirties, cells, they die."
p339
aVOK. It gets them to work harder, sometimes.
p340
aVAnd if you have your vision, vision is interesting.
p341
aVAs you age from infant age, your vision gets better,
p342
aVand maybe in your late teens, early twenties, you're looking for a mate,
p343
aVand your vision goes after that.
p344
aV(Laughter)
p345
aa(lp346
VYour social responsibility is very interesting.
p347
aVSo, as you get older, you may, like, have kids, whatever.
p348
aVAnd then the kids graduate, and you have no responsibility any more \u2014
p349
aVthat's very good, too.
p350
aa(lp351
VBut if any of you people ask,
p352
aV"What actually goes up? Does anything go up?
p353
aVWhat's the positive part of this, you know?" I think wisdom always goes up.
p354
aVI love these eighty-year-old, ninety-year-old guys and women.
p355
aVThey have so many thoughts, and they have so much wisdom,
p356
aVand I think \u2014 you know, this TED thing, I've come here.
p357
aVAnd this is the fourth time, and I come here for this wisdom, I think.
p358
aVThis whole TED effect, it sort of ups your wisdom, somehow.
p359
aVAnd I'm so glad to be here, and I'm very grateful to be here, Chris.
p360
aVAnd this is an amazing experience for me as well.
