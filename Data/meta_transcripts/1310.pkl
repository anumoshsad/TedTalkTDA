VDo you remember the story
p4
aVof Odysseus and the Sirens
p5
aVfrom high school or junior high school?
p6
aVThere was this hero, Odysseus, who's heading back home
p7
aVafter the Trojan War.
p8
aVAnd he's standing on the deck of his ship,
p9
aVhe's talking to his first mate,
p10
aVand he's saying,
p11
aV"Tomorrow, we will sail past those rocks,
p12
aVand on those rocks sit some beautiful women
p13
aVcalled Sirens.
p14
aVAnd these women sing an enchanting song,
p15
aVa song so alluring
p16
aVthat all sailors who hear it
p17
aVcrash into the rocks and die."
p18
aVNow you would expect, given that,
p19
aVthat they would choose an alternate route around the Sirens,
p20
aVbut instead Odysseus says,
p21
aV"I want to hear that song.
p22
aVAnd so what I'm going to do
p23
aVis I'm going to pour wax in the ears
p24
aVof you and all the men \u2014
p25
aVstay with me \u2014
p26
aVso that you can't hear the song,
p27
aVand then I'm going to have you tie me to the mast
p28
aVso that I can listen
p29
aVand we can all sail by unaffected."
p30
aVSo this is a captain
p31
aVputting the life of every single person on the ship at risk
p32
aVso that he can hear a song.
p33
aa(lp34
VAnd I'd like to think if this was the case,
p35
aVthey probably would have rehearsed it a few times.
p36
aVOdysseus would have said, "Okay, let's do a dry run.
p37
aVYou tie me to the mast, and I'm going to beg and plead.
p38
aVAnd no matter what I say, you cannot untie me from the mast.
p39
aVAll right, so tie me to the mast."
p40
aVAnd the first mate takes a rope
p41
aVand ties Odysseus to the mast in a nice knot.
p42
aVAnd Odysseus does his best job playacting
p43
aVand says, "Untie me. Untie me.
p44
aVI want to hear that song. Untie me."
p45
aVAnd the first mate wisely resists
p46
aVand doesn't untie Odysseus.
p47
aVAnd then Odysseus says, "I see that you can get it.
p48
aVAll right, untie me now and we'll get some dinner."
p49
aVAnd the first mate hesitates.
p50
aVHe's like, "Is this still the rehearsal,
p51
aVor should I untie him?"
p52
aVAnd the first mate thinks,
p53
aV"Well, I guess at some point the rehearsal has to end."
p54
aVSo he unties Odysseus, and Odysseus flips out.
p55
aVHe's like, "You idiot. You moron.
p56
aVIf you do that tomorrow, I'll be dead, you'll be dead,
p57
aVevery single one of the men will be dead.
p58
aVNow just don't untie me no matter what."
p59
aVHe throws the first mate to the ground.
p60
aVThis repeats itself through the night \u2014
p61
aVrehearsal, tying to the mast,
p62
aVconning his way out of it,
p63
aVbeating the poor first mate up mercilessly.
p64
aVHilarity ensues.
p65
aa(lp66
VTying yourself to a mast
p67
aVis perhaps the oldest written example
p68
aVof what psychologists call a commitment device.
p69
aVA commitment device is a decision that you make
p70
aVwith a cool head to bind yourself
p71
aVso that you don't do something regrettable
p72
aVwhen you have a hot head.
p73
aVBecause there's two heads inside one person
p74
aVwhen you think about it.
p75
aVScholars have long invoked this metaphor of two selves
p76
aVwhen it comes to questions of temptation.
p77
aVThere is first, the present self.
p78
aVThis is like Odysseus when he's hearing the song.
p79
aVHe just wants to get to the front row.
p80
aVHe just thinks about the here and now and the immediate gratification.
p81
aVBut then there's this other self, the future self.
p82
aVThis is Odysseus as an old man
p83
aVwho wants nothing more than to retire in a sunny villa
p84
aVwith his wife Penelope
p85
aVoutside of Ithaca \u2014 the other one.
p86
aa(lp87
VSo why do we need commitment devices?
p88
aVWell resisting temptation is hard,
p89
aVas the 19th century English economist
p90
aVNassau William Senior said,
p91
aV"To abstain from the enjoyment which is in our power,
p92
aVor to seek distant rather than immediate results,
p93
aVare among the most painful exertions
p94
aVof the human will."
p95
aVIf you set goals for yourself and you're like a lot of other people,
p96
aVyou probably realize
p97
aVit's not that your goals are physically impossible
p98
aVthat's keeping you from achieving them,
p99
aVit's that you lack the self-discipline to stick to them.
p100
aVIt's physically possible to lose weight.
p101
aVIt's physically possible to exercise more.
p102
aVBut resisting temptation
p103
aVis hard.
p104
aa(lp105
VThe other reason
p106
aVthat it's difficult to resist temptation
p107
aVis because it's an unequal battle
p108
aVbetween the present self and the future self.
p109
aVI mean, let's face it, the present self is present.
p110
aVIt's in control. It's in power right now.
p111
aVIt has these strong, heroic arms
p112
aVthat can lift doughnuts into your mouth.
p113
aVAnd the future self is not even around.
p114
aVIt's off in the future. It's weak.
p115
aVIt doesn't even have a lawyer present.
p116
aVThere's nobody to stick up for the future self.
p117
aVAnd so the present self can trounce
p118
aVall over its dreams.
p119
aVSo there's this battle between the two selves that's being fought,
p120
aVand we need commitment devices
p121
aVto level the playing field between the two.
p122
aa(lp123
VNow I'm a big fan of commitment devices actually.
p124
aVTying yourself to the mast is the oldest one, but there are other ones
p125
aVsuch as locking a credit card away with a key
p126
aVor not bringing junk food into the house so you won't eat it
p127
aVor unplugging your Internet connection
p128
aVso you can use your computer.
p129
aVI was creating commitment devices of my own
p130
aVlong before I knew what they were.
p131
aVSo when I was a starving post-doc
p132
aVat Columbia University,
p133
aVI was deep in a publish-or-perish phase of my career.
p134
aVI had to write five pages a day
p135
aVtowards papers
p136
aVor I would have to give up five dollars.
p137
aa(lp138
VAnd when you try to execute these commitment devices,
p139
aVyou realize the devil is really in the details.
p140
aVBecause it's not that easy to get rid of five dollars.
p141
aVI mean, you can't burn it; that's illegal.
p142
aVAnd I thought, well I could give it to a charity
p143
aVor give it to my wife or something like that.
p144
aVBut then I thought, oh, I'm sending myself mixed messages.
p145
aVBecause not writing is bad, but giving to charity is good.
p146
aVSo then I would kind of justify not writing
p147
aVby giving a gift.
p148
aVAnd then I kind of flipped that around and thought,
p149
aVwell I could give it to the neo-Nazis.
p150
aVBut then I was like, that's more bad than writing is good,
p151
aVand so that wouldn't work.
p152
aVSo ultimately, I just decided
p153
aVI would leave it in an envelope on the subway.
p154
aVSometimes a good person would find it,
p155
aVsometimes a bad person would find it.
p156
aVOn average, it was just a completely pointless exchange of money
p157
aVthat I would regret.
p158
aV(Laughter)
p159
aVSuch it is with commitment devices.
p160
aa(lp161
VBut despite my like for them,
p162
aVthere's two nagging concerns
p163
aVthat I've always had about commitment devices,
p164
aVand you might feel this if you use them yourself.
p165
aVSo the first is,
p166
aVwhen you've got one of these devices going,
p167
aVsuch as this contract to write everyday or pay,
p168
aVit's just a constant reminder
p169
aVthat you have no self-control.
p170
aVYou're just telling yourself, "Without you, commitment device,
p171
aVI am nothing, I have no self-discipline."
p172
aVAnd then when you're ever in a situation
p173
aVwhere you don't have a commitment device in place \u2014
p174
aVlike, "Oh my God, that person's offering me a doughnut,
p175
aVand I have no defense mechanism," \u2014
p176
aVyou just eat it.
p177
aVSo I don't like the way that they take the power away from you.
p178
aVI think self-discipline is something, it's like a muscle.
p179
aVThe more you exercise it, the stronger it gets.
p180
aa(lp181
VThe other problem with commitment devices
p182
aVis that you can always weasel your way out of them.
p183
aVYou say, "Well, of course I can't write today,
p184
aVbecause I'm giving a TEDTalk and I have five media interviews,
p185
aVand then I'm going to a cocktail party and then I'll be drunk after that.
p186
aVAnd so there's no way that this is going to work."
p187
aVSo in effect, you are like Odysseus and the first mate
p188
aVin one person.
p189
aVYou're putting yourself, you're binding yourself,
p190
aVand you're weaseling your way out of it,
p191
aVand then you're beating yourself up afterwards.
p192
aa(lp193
VSo I've been working
p194
aVfor about a decade now
p195
aVon finding other ways
p196
aVto change people's relationship to the future self
p197
aVwithout using commitment devices.
p198
aVIn particular, I'm interested in the relationship
p199
aVto the future financial self.
p200
aVAnd this is a timely issue.
p201
aVI'm talking about the topic of saving.
p202
aVNow saving is a classic two selves problem.
p203
aVThe present self does not want to save at all.
p204
aVIt wants to consume.
p205
aVWhereas the future self wants the present self to save.
p206
aVSo this is a timely problem.
p207
aVWe look at the savings rate
p208
aVand it has been declining since the 1950s.
p209
aVAt the same time, the Retirement Risk Index,
p210
aVthe chance of not being able to meet your needs in retirement,
p211
aVhas been increasing.
p212
aVAnd we're at a situation now
p213
aVwhere for every three baby boomers,
p214
aVthe McKinsey Global Institute predicts
p215
aVthat two will not be able to meet their pre-retirement needs
p216
aVwhile they're in retirement.
p217
aa(lp218
VSo what can we do about this?
p219
aVThere's a philosopher, Derek Parfit,
p220
aVwho said some words that were inspiring to my coauthors and I.
p221
aVHe said that, "We might neglect our future selves
p222
aVbecause of some failure of belief or imagination."
p223
aVThat is to say,
p224
aVwe somehow might not believe that we're going to get old,
p225
aVor we might not be able to imagine
p226
aVthat we're going to get old some day.
p227
aVOn the one hand, it sounds ridiculous.
p228
aVOf course, we know that we're going to get old.
p229
aVBut aren't there things that we believe and don't believe at the same time?
p230
aa(lp231
VSo my coauthors and I have used computers,
p232
aVthe greatest tool of our time,
p233
aVto assist people's imagination
p234
aVand help them imagine what it might be like
p235
aVto go into the future.
p236
aVAnd I'll show you some of these tools right here.
p237
aVThe first is called the distribution builder.
p238
aVIt shows people what the future might be like
p239
aVby showing them a hundred equally probable outcomes
p240
aVthat might be obtained in the future.
p241
aVEach outcome is shown by one of these markers,
p242
aVand each sits on a row
p243
aVthat represents a level of wealth and retirement.
p244
aVBeing up at the top
p245
aVmeans that you're enjoying a high income in retirement.
p246
aVBeing down at the bottom
p247
aVmeans that you're struggling to make ends meet.
p248
aVWhen you make an investment,
p249
aVwhat you're really saying is, "I accept
p250
aVthat any one of these 100 things
p251
aVcould happen to me and determine my wealth."
p252
aa(lp253
VNow you can try to move your outcomes around.
p254
aVYou can try to manipulate your fate, like this person is doing,
p255
aVbut it costs you something to do it.
p256
aVIt means that you have to save more today.
p257
aVOnce you find an investment that you're happy with,
p258
aVwhat people do is they click "done"
p259
aVand the markers begin to disappear,
p260
aVslowly, one by one.
p261
aVIt simulates what it is like to invest in something
p262
aVand to watch that investment pan out.
p263
aVAt the end, there will only be one marker left standing
p264
aVand it will determine our wealth in retirement.
p265
aa(lp266
VYes, this person retired
p267
aVat 150 percent of their working income in retirement.
p268
aVThey're making more money while retired
p269
aVthan they were making while they were working.
p270
aVIf you're like most people,
p271
aVjust seeing that gave you a small sense of elation and joy \u2014
p272
aVjust to think about making
p273
aV50 percent more money in retirement than before.
p274
aVHowever, had you ended up on the very bottom,
p275
aVit might have given you a slight sense
p276
aVof dread and/or nausea
p277
aVthinking about struggling to get by in retirement.
p278
aVBy using this tool over and over
p279
aVand simulating outcome after outcome,
p280
aVpeople can understand
p281
aVthat the investments and savings that they undertake today
p282
aVdetermine their well-being in the future.
p283
aa(lp284
VNow people are motivated through emotions,
p285
aVbut different people find different things motivating.
p286
aVThis is a simulation
p287
aVthat uses graphics,
p288
aVbut other people find motivating what money can buy,
p289
aVnot just numbers.
p290
aVSo here I made a distribution builder
p291
aVwhere instead of showing numerical outcomes,
p292
aVI show people what those outcomes will get you,
p293
aVin particular apartments that you can afford
p294
aVif you're retiring on 3,000, 2,500,
p295
aV2,000 dollars per month and so on.
p296
aVAs you move down the ladder of apartments,
p297
aVyou see that they get worse and worse.
p298
aVSome of them look like places I lived in as a graduate student.
p299
aVAnd as you get to the very bottom,
p300
aVyou're faced with the unfortunate reality
p301
aVthat if you don't save anything for retirement,
p302
aVyou won't be able to afford any housing at all.
p303
aVThose are actual pictures of actual apartments
p304
aVrenting for that amount
p305
aVas advertised on the Internet.
p306
aa(lp307
VThe last thing I'll show you,
p308
aVthe last behavioral time machine,
p309
aVis something that I created with Hal Hershfield,
p310
aVwho was introduced to me by my coauthor on a previous project,
p311
aVBill Sharpe.
p312
aVAnd what it is
p313
aVis an exploration into virtual reality.
p314
aVSo what we do is we take pictures of people \u2014
p315
aVin this case, college-age people \u2014
p316
aVand we use software to age them
p317
aVand show these people what they'll look like
p318
aVwhen they're 60, 70, 80 years old.
p319
aVAnd we try to test
p320
aVwhether actually assisting your imagination
p321
aVby looking at the face of your future self
p322
aVcan change you investment behavior.
p323
aa(lp324
VSo this is one of our experiments.
p325
aVHere we see the face of the young subject on the left.
p326
aVHe's given a control
p327
aVthat allows him to adjust his savings rate.
p328
aVAs he moves his savings rate down,
p329
aVit means that he's saving zero
p330
aVwhen it's all the way here at the left.
p331
aVYou can see his current annual income \u2014
p332
aVthis is the percentage of his paycheck that he can take home today \u2014
p333
aVis quite high, 91 percent,
p334
aVbut his retirement income is quite low.
p335
aVHe's going to retire on 44 percent
p336
aVof what he earned while he was working.
p337
aVIf he saves the maximum legal amount,
p338
aVhis retirement income goes up,
p339
aVbut he's unhappy
p340
aVbecause now he has less money on the left-hand side to spend today.
p341
aVOther conditions show people the future self.
p342
aVAnd from the future self's point of view, everything is in reverse.
p343
aVIf you save very little,
p344
aVthe future self is unhappy
p345
aVliving on 44 percent of the income.
p346
aVWhereas if the present self saves a lot,
p347
aVthe future self is delighted,
p348
aVwhere the income is close up near 100 percent.
p349
aa(lp350
VTo bring this to a wider audience,
p351
aVI've been working with Hal and Allianz
p352
aVto create something we call the behavioral time machine,
p353
aVin which you not only get to see yourself in the future,
p354
aVbut you get to see anticipated emotional reactions
p355
aVto different levels of retirement wealth.
p356
aVSo for instance,
p357
aVhere is somebody using the tool.
p358
aVAnd just watch the facial expressions
p359
aVas they move the slider.
p360
aVThe younger face gets happier and happier, saving nothing.
p361
aVThe older face is miserable.
p362
aVAnd slowly, slowly we're bringing it up to a moderate savings rate.
p363
aVAnd then it's a high savings rate.
p364
aVThe younger face is getting unhappy.
p365
aVThe older face is quite pleased
p366
aVwith the decision.
p367
aVWe're going to see if this has an effect on what people do.
p368
aVAnd what's nice about it
p369
aVis it's not something that biasing people actually,
p370
aVbecause as one face smiles,
p371
aVthe other face frowns.
p372
aVIt's not telling you which way to put the slider,
p373
aVit's just reminding you that you are
p374
aVconnected to and legally tied to
p375
aVthis future self.
p376
aa(lp377
VYour decisions today are going to determine its well-being.
p378
aVAnd that's something that's easy to forget.
p379
aVThis use of virtual reality
p380
aVis not just good for making people look older.
p381
aVThere are programs you can get
p382
aVto see how people might look
p383
aVif they smoke, if they get too much exposure to the sun,
p384
aVif they gain weight and so on.
p385
aVAnd what's good is,
p386
aVunlike in the experiments that Hal and myself ran with Russ Smith,
p387
aVyou don't have to program these by yourself
p388
aVin order to see the virtual reality.
p389
aVThere are applications you can get on smartphones for just a few dollars
p390
aVthat do the same thing.
p391
aVThis is actually a picture of Hal, my coauthor.
p392
aVYou might recognize him from the previous demos.
p393
aVAnd just for kicks we ran his picture
p394
aVthrough the balding, aging and weight gain software
p395
aVto see how he would look.
p396
aVHal is here, so I think we owe it to him as well as yourself
p397
aVto disabuse you of that last image.
p398
aVAnd I'll close it there.
p399
aa(lp400
VOn behalf of Hal and myself,
p401
aVI wish all the best to your present and future selves.
p402
aVThank you.
