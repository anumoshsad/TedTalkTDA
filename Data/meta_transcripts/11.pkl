VGood morning everyone. First of all, it's been fantastic
p4
aVbeing here over these past few days.
p5
aVAnd secondly, I feel it's a great honor to kind of wind up
p6
aVthis extraordinary gathering of people,
p7
aVthese amazing talks that we've had.
p8
aVI feel that I've fitted in, in many ways,
p9
aVto some of the things that I've heard.
p10
aVI came directly here
p11
aVfrom the deep, deep tropical rainforest in Ecuador,
p12
aVwhere I was out \u2014 you could only get there by a plane \u2014
p13
aVwith indigenous people with paint on their faces
p14
aVand parrot feathers on their headdresses,
p15
aVwhere these people are fighting to try and keep the oil companies,
p16
aVand keep the roads, out of their forests.
p17
aVThey're fighting to develop their own way of living within the forest
p18
aVin a world that's clean, a world that isn't contaminated,
p19
aVa world that isn't polluted.
p20
aVAnd what was so amazing to me, and what fits right in
p21
aVwith what we're all talking about here at TED,
p22
aVis that there, right in the middle of this rainforest,
p23
aVwas some solar panels \u2014 the first in that part of Ecuador \u2014
p24
aVand that was mainly to bring water up by pump
p25
aVso that the women wouldn't have to go down.
p26
aVThe water was cleaned, but because they got a lot of batteries,
p27
aVthey were able to store a lot of electricity.
p28
aVSo every house \u2014 and there were, I think, eight houses
p29
aVin this little community \u2014 could have light
p30
aVfor, I think it was about half an hour each evening.
p31
aVAnd there is the Chief, in all his regal finery, with a laptop computer.
p32
aV(Laughter)
p33
aVAnd this man, he has been outside, but he's gone back,
p34
aVand he was saying, "You know, we have suddenly jumped into
p35
aVa whole new era, and we didn't even know about the white man
p36
aV50 years ago, and now here we are with laptop computers,
p37
aVand there are some things we want to learn from the modern world.
p38
aVWe want to know about health care.
p39
aVWe want to know about what other people do \u2014 we're interested in it.
p40
aVAnd we want to learn other languages.
p41
aVWe want to know English and French and perhaps Chinese,
p42
aVand we're good at languages."
p43
aVSo there he is with his little laptop computer,
p44
aVbut fighting against the might of the pressures \u2014
p45
aVbecause of the debt, the foreign debt of Ecuador \u2014
p46
aVfighting the pressure of World Bank, IMF, and of course
p47
aVthe people who want to exploit the forests and take out the oil.
p48
aVAnd so, coming directly from there to here.
p49
aVBut, of course, my real field of expertise
p50
aVlies in an even different kind of civilization \u2014
p51
aVI can't really call it a civilization.
p52
aVA different way of life, a different being.
p53
aVWe've talked earlier \u2014 this wonderful talk by Wade Davis
p54
aVabout the different cultures of the humans around the world \u2014
p55
aVbut the world is not composed only of human beings;
p56
aVthere are also other animal beings.
p57
aVAnd I propose to bring into this TED conference,
p58
aVas I always do around the world, the voice of the animal kingdom.
p59
aVToo often we just see a few slides, or a bit of film,
p60
aVbut these beings have voices that mean something.
p61
aVAnd so, I want to give you a greeting,
p62
aVas from a chimpanzee in the forests of Tanzania \u2014
p63
aVOoh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
p64
aV(Applause)
p65
aVI've been studying chimpanzees in Tanzania since 1960.
p66
aVDuring that time, there have been modern technologies
p67
aVthat have really transformed the way
p68
aVthat field biologists do their work.
p69
aVFor example, for the first time, a few years ago,
p70
aVby simply collecting little fecal samples
p71
aVwe were able to have them analyzed \u2014 to have DNA profiling done \u2014
p72
aVso for the first time, we actually know which male chimps
p73
aVare the fathers of each individual infant.
p74
aVBecause the chimps have a very promiscuous mating society.
p75
aVSo this opens up a whole new avenue of research.
p76
aVAnd we use GSI \u2014 geographic whatever it is, GSI \u2014
p77
aVto determine the range of the chimps.
p78
aVAnd we're using \u2014 you can see that I'm not really into this kind of stuff \u2014
p79
aVbut we're using satellite imagery
p80
aVto look at the deforestation in the area.
p81
aVAnd of course, there's developments in infrared,
p82
aVso you can watch animals at night,
p83
aVand equipment for recording by video,
p84
aVand tape recording is getting lighter and better.
p85
aVSo in many, many ways, we can do things today
p86
aVthat we couldn't do when I began in 1960.
p87
aVEspecially when chimpanzees, and other animals
p88
aVwith large brains, are studied in captivity,
p89
aVmodern technology is helping us to search
p90
aVfor the upper levels of cognition in some of these non-human animals.
p91
aVSo that we know today, they're capable of performances
p92
aVthat would have been thought absolutely impossible
p93
aVby science when I began.
p94
aVI think the chimpanzee in captivity who is the most skilled
p95
aVin intellectual performance is one called Ai in Japan \u2014
p96
aVher name means love \u2014
p97
aVand she has a wonderfully sensitive partner working with her.
p98
aVShe loves her computer \u2014
p99
aVshe'll leave her big group, and her running water,
p100
aVand her trees and everything.
p101
aVAnd she'll come in to sit at this computer \u2014
p102
aVit's like a video game for a kid; she's hooked.
p103
aVShe's 28, by the way, and she does things with her computer screen
p104
aVand a touch pad that she can do faster than most humans.
p105
aVShe does very complex tasks, and I haven't got time to go into them,
p106
aVbut the amazing thing about this female is
p107
aVshe doesn't like making mistakes.
p108
aVIf she has a bad run, and her score isn't good,
p109
aVshe'll come and reach up and tap on the glass \u2014
p110
aVbecause she can't see the experimenter \u2014
p111
aVwhich is asking to have another go.
p112
aVAnd her concentration \u2014 she's already concentrated hard
p113
aVfor 20 minutes or so, and now she wants to do it all over again,
p114
aVjust for the satisfaction of having done it better.
p115
aVAnd the food is not important \u2014 she does get a tiny reward,
p116
aVlike one raisin for a correct response \u2014
p117
aVbut she will do it for nothing, if you tell her beforehand.
p118
aVSo here we are, a chimpanzee using a computer.
p119
aVChimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans also learn human sign language.
p120
aVBut the point is that when I was first in Gombe in 1960 \u2014
p121
aVI remember so well, so vividly, as though it was yesterday \u2014
p122
aVthe first time, when I was going through the vegetation,
p123
aVthe chimpanzees were still running away from me, for the most part,
p124
aValthough some were a little bit acclimatized \u2014
p125
aVand I saw this dark shape, hunched over a termite mound,
p126
aVand I peered with my binoculars.
p127
aVIt was, fortunately, one adult male whom I'd named David Greybeard \u2014
p128
aVand by the way, science at that time was telling me that I shouldn't name the chimps;
p129
aVthey should all have numbers; that was more scientific.
p130
aVAnyway, David Greybeard \u2014 and I saw that
p131
aVhe was picking little pieces of grass and using them
p132
aVto fish termites from their underground nest.
p133
aVAnd not only that \u2014 he would sometimes pick a leafy twig
p134
aVand strip the leaves \u2014
p135
aVmodifying an object to make it suitable for a specific purpose \u2014
p136
aVthe beginning of tool-making.
p137
aVThe reason this was so exciting and such a breakthrough
p138
aVis at that time, it was thought that humans,
p139
aVand only humans, used and made tools.
p140
aVWhen I was at school, we were defined as man, the toolmaker.
p141
aVSo that when Louis Leakey, my mentor, heard this news,
p142
aVhe said, "Ah, we must now redefine 'man,' redefine 'tool,'
p143
aVor accept chimpanzees as humans."
p144
aV(Laughter)
p145
aVWe now know that at Gombe alone, there are nine different ways
p146
aVin which chimpanzees use different objects for different purposes.
p147
aVMoreover, we know that in different parts of Africa,
p148
aVwherever chimps have been studied,
p149
aVthere are completely different tool-using behaviors.
p150
aVAnd because it seems that these patterns are passed
p151
aVfrom one generation to the next, through observation,
p152
aVimitation and practice \u2014 that is a definition of human culture.
p153
aVWhat we find is that over these 40-odd years
p154
aVthat I and others have been studying chimpanzees
p155
aVand the other great apes, and, as I say, other mammals
p156
aVwith complex brains and social systems,
p157
aVwe have found that after all, there isn't a sharp line
p158
aVdividing humans from the rest of the animal kingdom.
p159
aVIt's a very wuzzy line.
p160
aVIt's getting wuzzier all the time as we find animals doing things
p161
aVthat we, in our arrogance, used to think was just human.
p162
aVThe chimps \u2014 there's no time to discuss their fascinating lives \u2014
p163
aVbut they have this long childhood, five years
p164
aVof suckling and sleeping with the mother,
p165
aVand then another three, four or five years
p166
aVof emotional dependence on her, even when the next child is born.
p167
aVThe importance of learning in that time, when behavior is flexible \u2014
p168
aVand there's an awful lot to learn in chimpanzee society.
p169
aVThe long-term affectionate supportive bonds
p170
aVthat develop throughout this long childhood with the mother,
p171
aVwith the brothers and sisters,
p172
aVand which can last through a lifetime,
p173
aVwhich may be up to 60 years.
p174
aVThey can actually live longer than 60 in captivity,
p175
aVso we've only done 40 years in the wild so far.
p176
aVAnd we find chimps are capable of true compassion and altruism.
p177
aVWe find in their non-verbal communication \u2014 this is very rich \u2014
p178
aVthey have a lot of sounds, which they use in different circumstances,
p179
aVbut they also use touch, posture, gesture,
p180
aVand what do they do?
p181
aVThey kiss; they embrace; they hold hands.
p182
aVThey pat one another on the back; they swagger; they shake their fist \u2014
p183
aVthe kind of things that we do,
p184
aVand they do them in the same kind of context.
p185
aVThey have very sophisticated cooperation.
p186
aVSometimes they hunt \u2014 not that often,
p187
aVbut when they hunt, they show sophisticated cooperation,
p188
aVand they share the prey.
p189
aVWe find that they show emotions, similar to \u2014 maybe sometimes the same \u2014
p190
aVas those that we describe in ourselves as happiness, sadness, fear, despair.
p191
aVThey know mental as well as physical suffering.
p192
aVAnd I don't have time to go into the information
p193
aVthat will prove some of these things to you,
p194
aVsave to say that there are very bright students, in the best universities,
p195
aVstudying emotions in animals, studying personalities in animals.
p196
aVWe know that chimpanzees and some other creatures
p197
aVcan recognize themselves in mirrors \u2014 "self" as opposed to "other."
p198
aVThey have a sense of humor, and these are the kind of things
p199
aVwhich traditionally have been thought of as human prerogatives.
p200
aVBut this teaches us a new respect \u2014 and it's a new respect
p201
aVnot only for the chimpanzees, I suggest,
p202
aVbut some of the other amazing animals with whom we share this planet.
p203
aVOnce we're prepared to admit that after all,
p204
aVwe're not the only beings with personalities, minds
p205
aVand above all feelings, and then we start to think
p206
aVabout ways we use and abuse
p207
aVso many other sentient, sapient creatures on this planet,
p208
aVit really gives cause for deep shame, at least for me.
p209
aVSo, the sad thing is that these chimpanzees \u2014
p210
aVwho've perhaps taught us, more than any other creature, a little humility \u2014
p211
aVare in the wild, disappearing very fast.
p212
aVThey're disappearing for the reasons
p213
aVthat all of you in this room know only too well.
p214
aVThe deforestation, the growth of human populations, needing more land.
p215
aVThey're disappearing because some timber companies
p216
aVgo in with clear-cutting.
p217
aVThey're disappearing in the heart of their range in Africa
p218
aVbecause the big multinational logging companies have come in and made roads \u2014
p219
aVas they want to do in Ecuador
p220
aVand other parts where the forests remain untouched \u2014
p221
aVto take out oil or timber.
p222
aVAnd this has led in Congo basin, and other parts of the world,
p223
aVto what is known as the bush-meat trade.
p224
aVThis means that although for hundreds, perhaps thousands of years,
p225
aVpeople have lived in those forests, or whatever habitat it is,
p226
aVin harmony with their world, just killing the animals they need
p227
aVfor themselves and their families \u2014
p228
aVnow, suddenly, because of the roads,
p229
aVthe hunters can go in from the towns.
p230
aVThey shoot everything, every single thing that moves
p231
aVthat's bigger than a small rat; they sun-dry it or smoke it.
p232
aVAnd now they've got transport; they take it on the logging trucks
p233
aVor the mining trucks into the towns where they sell it.
p234
aVAnd people will pay more for bush-meat, as it's called,
p235
aVthan for domestic meat \u2014 it's culturally preferred.
p236
aVAnd it's not sustainable, and the huge logging camps in the forest
p237
aVare now demanding meat, so the Pygmy hunters in the Congo basin
p238
aVwho've lived there with their wonderful way of living
p239
aVfor so many hundreds of years are now corrupted.
p240
aVThey're given weapons; they shoot for the logging camps; they get money.
p241
aVTheir culture is being destroyed,
p242
aValong with the animals upon whom they depend.
p243
aVSo, when the logging camp moves, there's nothing left.
p244
aVWe talked already about the loss of human cultural diversity,
p245
aVand I've seen it happening with my own eyes.
p246
aVAnd the grim picture in Africa \u2014 I love Africa,
p247
aVand what do we see in Africa?
p248
aVWe see deforestation;
p249
aVwe see the desert spreading; we see massive hunger;
p250
aVwe see disease and we see population growth in areas
p251
aVwhere there are more people living on a certain piece of land
p252
aVthan the land can possibly support,
p253
aVand they're too poor to buy food from elsewhere.
p254
aVWere the people that we heard about yesterday,
p255
aVon the Easter Island, who cut down their last tree \u2014 were they stupid?
p256
aVDidn't they know what was happening?
p257
aVOf course, but if you've seen the crippling poverty
p258
aVin some of these parts of the world
p259
aVit isn't a question of "Let's leave the tree for tomorrow."
p260
aV"How am I going to feed my family today?
p261
aVMaybe I can get just a few dollars from this last tree
p262
aVwhich will keep us going a little bit longer,
p263
aVand then we'll pray that something will happen
p264
aVto save us from the inevitable end."
p265
aVSo, this is a pretty grim picture.
p266
aVThe one thing we have, which makes us so different
p267
aVfrom chimpanzees or other living creatures,
p268
aVis this sophisticated spoken language \u2014
p269
aVa language with which we can tell children
p270
aVabout things that aren't here.
p271
aVWe can talk about the distant past, plan for the distant future,
p272
aVdiscuss ideas with each other,
p273
aVso that the ideas can grow from the accumulated wisdom of a group.
p274
aVWe can do it by talking to each other;
p275
aVwe can do it through video; we can do it through the written word.
p276
aVAnd we are abusing this great power we have to be wise stewards,
p277
aVand we're destroying the world.
p278
aVIn the developed world, in a way, it's worse,
p279
aVbecause we have so much access to knowledge
p280
aVof the stupidity of what we're doing.
p281
aVDo you know, we're bringing little babies
p282
aVinto a world where, in many places, the water is poisoning them?
p283
aVAnd the air is harming them, and the food that's grown
p284
aVfrom the contaminated land is poisoning them.
p285
aVAnd that's not just in the far-away developing world; that's everywhere.
p286
aVDo you know we all have about 50 chemicals
p287
aVin our bodies we didn't have about 50 years ago?
p288
aVAnd so many of these diseases, like asthma
p289
aVand certain kinds of cancers, are on the increase
p290
aVaround places where our filthy toxic waste is dumped.
p291
aVWe're harming ourselves around the world,
p292
aVas well as harming the animals, as well as harming nature herself \u2014
p293
aVMother Nature, that brought us into being;
p294
aVMother Nature, where I believe we need to spend time,
p295
aVwhere there's trees and flowers and birds
p296
aVfor our good psychological development.
p297
aVAnd yet, there are hundreds and hundreds of children
p298
aVin the developed world who never see nature,
p299
aVbecause they're growing up in concrete
p300
aVand all they know is virtual reality,
p301
aVwith no opportunity to go and lie in the sun,
p302
aVor in the forest, with the dappled sun-specks
p303
aVcoming down from the canopy above.
p304
aVAs I was traveling around the world, you know,
p305
aVI had to leave the forest \u2014 that's where I love to be.
p306
aVI had to leave these fascinating chimpanzees
p307
aVfor my students and field staff to continue studying
p308
aVbecause, finding they dwindled from about two million
p309
aV100 years ago to about 150,000 now,
p310
aVI knew I had to leave the forest to do what I could
p311
aVto raise awareness around the world.
p312
aVAnd the more I talked about the chimpanzees' plight,
p313
aVthe more I realized the fact that everything's interconnected,
p314
aVand the problems of the developing world
p315
aVso often stem from the greed of the developed world,
p316
aVand everything was joining together, and making \u2014 not sense,
p317
aVhope lies in sense, you said \u2014 it's making a nonsense.
p318
aVHow can we do it?
p319
aVSomebody said that yesterday.
p320
aVAnd as I was traveling around, I kept meeting young people who'd lost hope.
p321
aVThey were feeling despair,
p322
aVthey were feeling, "Well, it doesn't matter what we do;
p323
aVeat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die.
p324
aVEverything is hopeless \u2014 we're always being told so by the media."
p325
aVAnd then I met some who were angry,
p326
aVand anger that can turn to violence,
p327
aVand we're all familiar with that.
p328
aVAnd I have three little grandchildren,
p329
aVand when some of these students would say to me
p330
aVat high school or university, they'd say, "We're angry,"
p331
aVor "We're filled with despair, because we feel
p332
aVyou've compromised our future, and there's nothing we can do about it."
p333
aVAnd I looked in the eyes of my little grandchildren,
p334
aVand think how much we've harmed this planet since I was their age.
p335
aVI feel this deep shame, and that's why in 1991 in Tanzania,
p336
aVI started a program that's called Roots and Shoots.
p337
aVThere's little brochures all around outside,
p338
aVand if any of you have anything to do with children and care about their future,
p339
aVI beg that you pick up that brochure.
p340
aVAnd Roots and Shoots is a program for hope.
p341
aVRoots make a firm foundation.
p342
aVShoots seem tiny,
p343
aVbut to reach the sun they can break through brick walls.
p344
aVSee the brick walls as all the problems
p345
aVthat we've inflicted on this planet.
p346
aVThen, you see, it is a message of hope.
p347
aVHundreds and thousands of young people around the world
p348
aVcan break through, and can make this a better world.
p349
aVAnd the most important message of Roots and Shoots
p350
aVis that every single individual makes a difference.
p351
aVEvery individual has a role to play.
p352
aVEvery one of us impacts the world around us everyday,
p353
aVand you scientists know that you can't actually \u2014
p354
aVeven if you stay in bed all day, you're breathing oxygen
p355
aVand giving out CO2, and probably going to the loo,
p356
aVand things like that \u2014
p357
aVyou're making a difference in the world.
p358
aVSo, the Roots and Shoots program
p359
aVinvolves youth in three kinds of projects.
p360
aVAnd these are projects to make the world around them a better place.
p361
aVOne project to show care and concern for your own human community.
p362
aVOne for animals, including domestic animals \u2014 and I have to say,
p363
aVI learned everything I know about animal behavior
p364
aVeven before I got to Gombe and the chimps from my dog, Rusty,
p365
aVwho was my childhood companion.
p366
aVAnd the third kind of project: something for the local environment.
p367
aVSo what the kids do depends first of all, how old are they \u2014
p368
aVand we go now from pre-school right through university.
p369
aVIt's going to depend whether they're inner-city or rural.
p370
aVIt's going to depend if they're wealthy or impoverished.
p371
aVIt's going to depend which part, say, of America they're in.
p372
aVWe're in every state now, and the problems in Florida
p373
aVare different from the problems in New York.
p374
aVIt's going to depend on which country they're in \u2014
p375
aVand we're already in 60-plus countries, with about 5,000 active groups \u2014
p376
aVand there are groups all over the place that I keep hearing about
p377
aVthat I've never even heard of, because the kids are taking the program
p378
aVand spreading it themselves.
p379
aVWhy?
p380
aVBecause they're buying into it,
p381
aVand they're the ones who get to decide what they're going to do.
p382
aVIt isn't something that their parents tell them,
p383
aVor their teachers tell them.
p384
aVThat's effective, but if they decide themselves,
p385
aV"We want to clean this river
p386
aVand put the fish back that used to be there.
p387
aVWe want to clear away the toxic soil
p388
aVfrom this area and have an organic garden.
p389
aVWe want to go and spend time with the old people
p390
aVand hear their stories and record their oral histories.
p391
aVWe want to go and work in a dog shelter.
p392
aVWe want to learn about animals. We want ... "
p393
aVYou know, it goes on and on, and this is very hopeful for me.
p394
aVAs I travel around the world 300 days a year,
p395
aVeverywhere there's a group of Roots and Shoots of different ages.
p396
aVEverywhere there are children with shining eyes saying,
p397
aV"Look at the difference we've made."
p398
aVAnd now comes the technology into it,
p399
aVbecause with this new way of communicating electronically
p400
aVthese kids can communicate with each other around the world.
p401
aVAnd if anyone is interested to help us, we've got so many ideas
p402
aVbut we need help \u2014 we need help to create the right kind of system
p403
aVthat will help these young people to communicate their excitement.
p404
aVBut also \u2014 and this is so important \u2014 to communicate their despair,
p405
aVto say, "We've tried this and it doesn't work, and what shall we do?"
p406
aVAnd then, lo and behold, there's another group answering these kids
p407
aVwho may be in America, or maybe this is a group in Israel,
p408
aVsaying, "Yeah, you did it a little bit wrong. This is how you should do it."
p409
aVThe philosophy is very simple.
p410
aVWe do not believe in violence.
p411
aVNo violence, no bombs, no guns.
p412
aVThat's not the way to solve problems.
p413
aVViolence leads to violence, at least in my view.
p414
aVSo how do we solve?
p415
aVThe tools for solving the problems are knowledge and understanding.
p416
aVKnow the facts, but see how they fit in the big picture.
p417
aVHard work and persistence \u2014don't give up \u2014
p418
aVand love and compassion leading to respect for all life.
p419
aVHow many more minutes? Two, one?
p420
aVChris Anderson: One \u2014 one to two.
p421
aVJane Goodall: Two, two, I'm going to take two.
p422
aV(Laughter)
p423
aVAre you going to come and drag me off?
p424
aV(Laughter)
p425
aVAnyway \u2014 so basically, Roots and Shoots
p426
aVis beginning to change young people's lives.
p427
aVIt's what I'm devoting most of my energy to.
p428
aVAnd I believe that a group like this can have a very major impact,
p429
aVnot just because you can share technology with us,
p430
aVbut because so many of you have children.
p431
aVAnd if you take this program out, and give it to your children,
p432
aVthey have such a good opportunity to go out and do good,
p433
aVbecause they've got parents like you.
p434
aVAnd it's been so clear how much you all care
p435
aVabout trying to make this world a better place.
p436
aVIt's very encouraging.
p437
aVBut the kids do ask me \u2014
p438
aVand this won't take more than two minutes, I promise \u2014
p439
aVthe kids say, "Dr. Jane, do you really have hope for the future?
p440
aVYou travel, you see all these horrible things happening."
p441
aVFirstly, the human brain \u2014 I don't need to say anything about that.
p442
aVNow that we know what the problems are around the world,
p443
aVhuman brains like yours are rising to solve those problems.
p444
aVAnd we've talked a lot about that.
p445
aVSecondly, the resilience of nature.
p446
aVWe can destroy a river,
p447
aVand we can bring it back to life.
p448
aVWe can see a whole area desolated,
p449
aVand it can be brought back to bloom again, with time or a little help.
p450
aVAnd thirdly, the last speaker talked about \u2014 or the speaker before last,
p451
aVtalked about the indomitable human spirit.
p452
aVWe are surrounded by the most amazing people
p453
aVwho do things that seem to be absolutely impossible.
p454
aVNelson Mandela \u2014 I take a little piece of limestone
p455
aVfrom Robben Island Prison, where he labored for 27 years,
p456
aVand came out with so little bitterness, he could lead his people
p457
aVfrom the horror of apartheid without a bloodbath.
p458
aVEven after the 11th of September \u2014 and I was in New York
p459
aVand I felt the fear \u2014 nevertheless, there was so much human courage,
p460
aVso much love and so much compassion.
p461
aVAnd then as I went around the country after that and felt the fear \u2014
p462
aVthe fear that was leading to people feeling
p463
aVthey couldn't worry about the environment any more,
p464
aVin case they seemed not to be patriotic \u2014
p465
aVand I was trying to encourage them,
p466
aVsomebody came up with a little quotation from Mahatma Gandhi,
p467
aV"If you look back through human history,
p468
aVyou see that every evil regime has been overcome by good."
p469
aVAnd just after that a woman brought me this little bell,
p470
aVand I want to end on this note.
p471
aVShe said, "If you're talking about hope and peace, ring this.
p472
aVThis bell is made from metal from a defused landmine,
p473
aVfrom the killing fields of Pol Pot \u2014
p474
aVone of the most evil regimes in human history \u2014
p475
aVwhere people are now beginning to put their lives back together
p476
aVafter the regime has crumbled.
p477
aVSo, yes, there is hope, and where is the hope?
p478
aVIs it out there with the politicians?
p479
aVIt's in our hands.
p480
aVIt's in your hands and my hands
p481
aVand those of our children.
p482
aVIt's really up to us.
p483
aVWe're the ones who can make a difference.
p484
aVIf we lead lives where we consciously leave
p485
aVthe lightest possible ecological footprints,
p486
aVif we buy the things that are ethical for us to buy
p487
aVand don't buy the things that are not,
p488
aVwe can change the world overnight.
p489
aVThank you.
