VWell, this is 2009.
p4
aVAnd it's the Bicentenary of Charles Darwin.
p5
aVAnd all over the world, eminent evolutionists
p6
aVare anxious to celebrate this.
p7
aVAnd what they're planning to do is to enlighten us
p8
aVon almost every aspect
p9
aVof Darwin and his life,
p10
aVand how he changed our thinking.
p11
aVI say almost every aspect,
p12
aVbecause there is one aspect of this story
p13
aVwhich they have thrown no light on.
p14
aVAnd they seem anxious to skirt around it and step over it
p15
aVand to talk about something else.
p16
aVSo I'm going to talk about it.
p17
aVIt's the question of, why are we so different from the chimpanzees?
p18
aa(lp19
VWe get the geneticists keeping on telling us
p20
aVhow extremely closely we are related \u2014 hardly any genes of difference,
p21
aVvery, very closely related.
p22
aVAnd yet, when you look at the phenotypes,
p23
aVthere's a chimp, there's a man;
p24
aVthey're astoundingly different,
p25
aVno resemblance at all.
p26
aVI'm not talking about airy-fairy stuff
p27
aVabout culture or psychology, or behavior.
p28
aVI'm talking about ground-base, nitty-gritty,
p29
aVmeasurable physical differences.
p30
aVThey, that one,
p31
aVis hairy and walking on four legs.
p32
aVThat one is a naked biped. Why?
p33
aVI mean \u2014
p34
aV(Laughter)
p35
aVif I'm a good Darwinist, I've got to believe
p36
aVthere's a reason for that.
p37
aVIf we changed so much, something must have happened.
p38
aVWhat happened?
p39
aa(lp40
VNow 50 years ago, that was a laughably simple question.
p41
aVEverybody knew the answer.
p42
aVThey knew what happened.
p43
aVThe ancestor of the apes stayed in the trees;
p44
aVour ancestors went out onto the plain.
p45
aVThat explained everything.
p46
aVWe had to get up on our legs to peer over the tall grass,
p47
aVor to chase after animals,
p48
aVor to free our hands for weapons.
p49
aVAnd we got so overheated in the chase
p50
aVthat we had to take off that fur coat and throw it away.
p51
aVEverybody knew that, for generations.
p52
aa(lp53
VBut then, in the '90s, something began to unravel.
p54
aVThe paleontologists themselves looked a bit more closely
p55
aVat the accompanying microfauna
p56
aVthat lived in the same time and place as the hominids.
p57
aVAnd they weren't savanna species.
p58
aVAnd they looked at the herbivores. And they weren't savanna herbivores.
p59
aVAnd then they were so clever, they found a way to analyze
p60
aVfossilized pollen.
p61
aVShock, horror.
p62
aVThe fossilized pollen was not of savanna vegetation.
p63
aVSome of it even came from lianas,
p64
aVthose things that dangle in the middle of the jungle.
p65
aa(lp66
VSo we're left with a situation where
p67
aVwe know that our earliest ancestors
p68
aVwere moving around on four legs in the trees,
p69
aVbefore the savanna ecosystem even came into existence.
p70
aVThis is not something I've made up.
p71
aVIt's not a minority theory.
p72
aVEverybody agrees with it.
p73
aa(lp74
VProfessor Tobias came over from South Africa
p75
aVand spoke to University College London.
p76
aVHe said, "Everything I've been telling you for the last 20 years,
p77
aVforget about it. It was wrong.
p78
aVWe've got to go back to square one and start again."
p79
aVIt made him very unpopular. They didn't want to go back to square one.
p80
aa(lp81
VI mean, it's a terrible thing to happen.
p82
aVYou've got this beautiful paradigm.
p83
aVYou've believed it through generations.
p84
aVNobody has questioned it.
p85
aVYou've been constructing fanciful things on top of it,
p86
aVrelying on it to be as solid as a rock.
p87
aVAnd now it's whipped away from under you.
p88
aVWhat do you do? What does a scientist do in that case?
p89
aa(lp90
VWell, we know the answer because
p91
aVThomas S. Kuhn
p92
aVwrote a seminal treatise
p93
aVabout this back in 1962.
p94
aVHe said what scientists do
p95
aVwhen a paradigm fails
p96
aVis, guess what \u2014 they carry on as if nothing had happened.
p97
aV(Laughter)
p98
aVIf they haven't got a paradigm they can't ask the question.
p99
aVSo they say, "Yes it's wrong,
p100
aVbut supposing it was right ..."
p101
aV(Laughter)
p102
aVAnd the only other option open to them
p103
aVis to stop asking the questions.
p104
aVSo that is what they have done now.
p105
aVThat's why you don't hear them talking about it. It's yesterday's question.
p106
aa(lp107
VSome of them have even elevated it into a principle.
p108
aVIt's what we ought to be doing.
p109
aVAaron Filler from Harvard said,
p110
aV"Isn't it time we stopped talking about selective pressures?
p111
aVI mean, why don't we talk about, well, there's chromosomes, and there's genes.
p112
aVAnd we just record what we see."
p113
aVCharles Darwin must be spinning in his grave!
p114
aVHe knew all about that kind of science.
p115
aVAnd he called it hypothesis-free science.
p116
aVAnd he despised it from the bottom of his heart.
p117
aVAnd if you're going to say,
p118
aV"I'm going to stop talking about selective pressures,"
p119
aVyou can take "The Origin of Species" and throw it out of the window,
p120
aVfor it's about nothing else but selective pressures.
p121
aa(lp122
VAnd the irony of it is,
p123
aVthat this is one occasion of a paradigm collapse
p124
aVwhere we didn't have to wait for a new paradigm to come up.
p125
aVThere was one waiting in the wings.
p126
aVIt had been waiting there since 1960
p127
aVwhen Alister Hardy, a marine biologist,
p128
aVsaid, "I think what happened,
p129
aVperhaps our ancestors
p130
aVhad a more aquatic existence
p131
aVfor some of the time."
p132
aVHe kept it to himself for 30 years.
p133
aVBut then the press got hold of it and all hell broke loose.
p134
aVAll his colleagues said, "This is outrageous.
p135
aVYou've exposed us to public ridicule!
p136
aVYou must never do that again."
p137
aVAnd at that time, it became set in stone:
p138
aVthe aquatic theory should be dumped
p139
aVwith the UFOs and the yetis,
p140
aVas part of the lunatic fringe of science.
p141
aa(lp142
VWell I don't think that.
p143
aVI think that Hardy had a lot going for him.
p144
aVI'd like to talk about just a handful
p145
aVof what have been called the
p146
aVhallmarks of mankind,
p147
aVthe things that made us different from everybody else,
p148
aVand all our relatives.
p149
aVLet's look at our naked skin.
p150
aVIt's obvious that most of the things we think about
p151
aVthat have lost their body hair, mammals without body hair,
p152
aVare aquatic ones, like the dugong, the walrus,
p153
aVthe dolphin, the hippopotamus, the manatee.
p154
aVAnd a couple of wallowers-in-mud like the babirusa.
p155
aVAnd you're tempted to think, well perhaps,
p156
aVcould that be why we are naked?
p157
aa(lp158
VI suggested it and people said, "No no no.
p159
aVI mean, look at the elephant.
p160
aVYou've forgotten all about the elephant haven't you?"
p161
aVSo back in 1982 I said,
p162
aV"Well perhaps the elephant had an aquatic ancestor."
p163
aVPeals of merry laughter!
p164
aV"That crazy woman. She's off again. She'll say anything won't she?"
p165
aVBut by now, everybody agrees that the elephant had an aquatic ancestor.
p166
aVThis has come 'round to be that all those naked pachyderms
p167
aVhave aquatic ancestors.
p168
aVThe last exception was supposed to be the rhinoceros.
p169
aa(lp170
VLast year in Florida they found extinct ancestor of a rhinoceros
p171
aVand said, "Seems to have spent most of its time in the water."
p172
aVSo this is a close connection between nakedness and water.
p173
aVAs an absolute connection, it only works one way.
p174
aVYou can't say all aquatic animals are naked,
p175
aVbecause look at the sea otter.
p176
aVBut you can say
p177
aVthat every animal that has become naked
p178
aVhas been conditioned by water, in its own lifetime,
p179
aVor the lifetime of its ancestors. I think this is significant.
p180
aVThe only exception is the naked Somalian mole-rat,
p181
aVwhich never puts its nose above the surface of the ground.
p182
aa(lp183
VAnd take bipedality.
p184
aVHere you can't find anybody to compare it with,
p185
aVbecause we're the only animal that walks upright on two legs.
p186
aVBut you can say this: all the apes and all the monkeys
p187
aVare capable of walking on two legs,
p188
aVif they want to, for a short time.
p189
aVThere is only one circumstance in which they
p190
aValways, all of them, walk on two legs,
p191
aVand that is when they are wading through water.
p192
aVDo you think that's significant?
p193
aVDavid Attenborough thinks it's significant,
p194
aVas the possible beginning of our bipedalism.
p195
aa(lp196
VLook at the fat layer.
p197
aVWe have got, under our skin, a layer of fat, all over:
p198
aVnothing in the least like that in any other primate.
p199
aVWhy should it be there?
p200
aVWell they do know, that if you look at other aquatic mammals,
p201
aVthe fat that in most land mammals
p202
aVis deposited inside the body wall,
p203
aVaround the kidneys and the intestines and so on,
p204
aVhas started to migrate to the outside,
p205
aVand spread out in a layer inside the skin.
p206
aVIn the whale it's complete:
p207
aVno fat inside at all, all in blubber outside.
p208
aVWe cannot avoid the suspicion
p209
aVthat in our case it's started to happen.
p210
aVWe have got skin lined with this layer.
p211
aVIt's the only possible explanation of why humans,
p212
aVif they're very unlucky,
p213
aVcan become grossly obese,
p214
aVin a way that would be totally impossible for any other primate, physically impossible.
p215
aVSomething very odd, matter-of-factly, never explained.
p216
aa(lp217
VThe question of why we can speak.
p218
aVWe can speak.
p219
aVAnd the gorilla can't speak. Why?
p220
aVNothing to do with his teeth or his tongue or his lungs or anything like that \u2014
p221
aVpurely has to do with its conscious control of its breath.
p222
aVYou can't even train a gorilla to say "Ah" on request.
p223
aVThe only creatures that have got conscious control of their breath
p224
aVare the diving animals and the diving birds.
p225
aVIt was an absolute precondition for our being able to speak.
p226
aa(lp227
VAnd then again, there is the fact that we are streamlined.
p228
aVTrying to imagine a diver
p229
aVdiving into water \u2014 hardly makes a splash.
p230
aVTry to imagine a gorilla
p231
aVperforming the same maneuver,
p232
aVand you can see that, compared with gorilla,
p233
aVwe are halfway to being shaped like a fish.
p234
aVI am trying to suggest that, for 40-odd years,
p235
aVthis aquatic idea has been miscategorized as lunatic fringe,
p236
aVand it is not lunatic fringe.
p237
aa(lp238
VAnd the ironic thing about it is that
p239
aVthey are not staving off the aquatic theory
p240
aVto protect a theory of their own,
p241
aVwhich they've all agreed on, and they love.
p242
aVThere is nothing there.
p243
aVThey are staving off the aquatic theory
p244
aVto protect a vacuum.
p245
aV(Laughter)
p246
aV(Applause)
p247
aa(lp248
VHow do they react when I say these things?
p249
aVOne very common reaction I've heard about 20 times
p250
aVis, "But it was investigated.
p251
aVThey conducted a serious investigation of this at the beginning,
p252
aVwhen Hardy put forward his article."
p253
aVI don't believe it.
p254
aVFor 35 years I've been looking for any evidence
p255
aVof any incident of that kind,
p256
aVand I've concluded that that's one of the urban myths.
p257
aVIt's never been done.
p258
aa(lp259
VI ask people sometimes, and they say,
p260
aV"I like the aquatic theory!
p261
aVEverybody likes the aquatic theory.
p262
aVOf course they don't believe it, but they like it."
p263
aVWell I say, "Why do you think it's rubbish?"
p264
aVThey say "Well ...
p265
aVeverybody I talk to says it's rubbish.
p266
aVAnd they can't all be wrong, can they?"
p267
aVThe answer to that, loud and clear, is, "Yes! They can all be wrong."
p268
aVHistory is strewn with the cases when they've all got it wrong.
p269
aV(Applause)
p270
aVAnd if you've got a scientific problem like that,
p271
aVyou can't solve it by holding a head count,
p272
aVand saying, "More of us say yes than say no."
p273
aa(lp274
V(Laughter)
p275
aa(lp276
VApart from that, some of the heads count more than others.
p277
aVSome of them have come over.
p278
aVThere was Professor Tobias. He's come over.
p279
aVDaniel Dennett, he's come over.
p280
aVSir David Attenborough, he's come over.
p281
aVAnybody else out there? Come on in.
p282
aVThe water is lovely.
p283
aa(lp284
V(Applause)
p285
aa(lp286
VAnd now we've got to look to the future.
p287
aVUltimately one of three things is going to happen.
p288
aVEither they will go on for the next 40 years, 50 years, 60 years.
p289
aV"Yeah well we don't talk about that. Let's talk about something interesting."
p290
aVThat would be very sad.
p291
aVThe second thing that could happen
p292
aVis that some young genius will arrive,
p293
aVand say, "I've found it.
p294
aVIt was not the savanna, it was not the water, it was this!"
p295
aVNo sign of that happening either.
p296
aVI don't think there is a third option.
p297
aa(lp298
VSo the third thing that might happen is
p299
aVa very beautiful thing.
p300
aVIf you look back at the early years of the last century,
p301
aVthere was a stand-off, a lot of bickering and bad feeling
p302
aVbetween the believers in Mendel,
p303
aVand the believers in Darwin.
p304
aVIt ended with a new synthesis:
p305
aVDarwin's ideas and Mendel's ideas
p306
aVblending together.
p307
aVAnd I think the same thing will happen here.
p308
aVYou'll get a new synthesis.
p309
aVHardy's ideas and Darwin's ideas
p310
aVwill be blended together.
p311
aa(lp312
VAnd we can move forward from there,
p313
aVand really get somewhere.
p314
aVThat would be a beautiful thing.
p315
aVIt would be very nice for me if it happened soon.
p316
aV(Laughter)
p317
aVBecause I'm older now than George Burns was when he said,
p318
aV"At my age, I don't even buy green bananas."
p319
aa(lp320
V(Laughter)
p321
aa(lp322
VSo if it's going to come and it's going to happen,
p323
aVwhat's holding it up?
p324
aVI can tell you that in three words.
p325
aVAcademia says no.
p326
aVThey decided in 1960,
p327
aV"That belongs with the UFOs and the yetis."
p328
aVAnd it's not easy to change their minds.
p329
aVThe professional journals
p330
aVwon't touch it with a barge pole.
p331
aVThe textbooks don't mention it.
p332
aVThe syllabus doesn't mention even the fact that we're naked,
p333
aVlet alone look for a reason to it.
p334
aV"Horizon," which takes its cue from the academics,
p335
aVwon't touch it with a barge pole.
p336
aVSo we never hear the case put for it,
p337
aVexcept in jocular references
p338
aVto people on the lunatic fringe.
p339
aa(lp340
VI don't know quite where this diktat comes from.
p341
aVSomebody up there
p342
aVis issuing the commandment,
p343
aV"Thou shalt not believe in the aquatic theory.
p344
aVAnd if you hope to make progress in this profession,
p345
aVand you do believe it, you'd better keep it to yourself,
p346
aVbecause it will get in your way."
p347
aa(lp348
VSo I get the impression that some parts
p349
aVof the scientific establishment
p350
aVare morphing into a kind of priesthood.
p351
aVBut you know, that makes me feel good,
p352
aVbecause Richard Dawkins has told us
p353
aVhow to treat a priesthood.
p354
aV(Laughter)
p355
aVHe says, "Firstly, you've got to refuse to give it
p356
aVall the excessive awe and reverence
p357
aVit's been trained to receive."
p358
aVRight. I'll go ahead with that.
p359
aVAnd secondly, he says,
p360
aV"You must never be afraid to rock the boat."
p361
aVI'll go along with that too.
p362
aVThank you very much.
p363
aa(lp364
