VScientific breakthrough,
p4
aVthe kind that can potentially save lives,
p5
aVcan sometimes be lying right out in the open
p6
aVfor us to discover,
p7
aVin the evolved, accumulated body
p8
aVof human anecdote, for example,
p9
aVor in the time-tested adaptations
p10
aVthat we observe in the natural world around us.
p11
aVScience starts with observation,
p12
aVbut the trick is to identify the patterns and signatures
p13
aVthat we might otherwise dismiss
p14
aVas myth or coincidence,
p15
aVisolate them, and test them with scientific rigor.
p16
aVAnd when we do, the results will often surprise.
p17
aa(lp18
VWestern Australia has had a particular problem
p19
aVwith shark attacks over the last three years,
p20
aVunfortunately and tragically culminating
p21
aVin five fatal shark attacks in a 10-month period
p22
aVduring that time.
p23
aVBut Western Australia is not alone in this.
p24
aVThe incident of shark engagements on humans
p25
aVis escalating worldwide.
p26
aVAnd so it's not surprising, perhaps,
p27
aVthat in July of this year,
p28
aVShark Attack Mitigation Systems in collaboration
p29
aVwith the University of Western Australia Oceans Institute
p30
aVmade an announcement which captured the attention
p31
aVof the worldwide media and of ocean users
p32
aVworldwide,
p33
aVand that was around the development of technology
p34
aVto mitigate or reduce the risk of shark attack
p35
aVbased on the science of what sharks can see.
p36
aVAnd I have for you today
p37
aVthe story of that journey,
p38
aVbut also the notion that science can be
p39
aVas powerful as a translator
p40
aVas it can be for invention.
p41
aa(lp42
VWhen we began this process,
p43
aVwe were looking, it was about three years ago,
p44
aVand we'd just had the first two fatal shark attacks
p45
aVin Western Australia,
p46
aVand by chance, in a previous role,
p47
aVI happened to be having dinner with Harry Butler.
p48
aVNow Harry Butler, who most Australians would know is a famous naturalist,
p49
aVhad spent a lot of time in the marine environment.
p50
aVHarry Butler is a precursor, if you like,
p51
aVto the late Steve Irwin.
p52
aVWhen I asked him about
p53
aVwhat the solution to the problem might be,
p54
aVthe answer was quite surprising.
p55
aVHe said, "Take a black wetsuit,
p56
aVband it in yellow stripes like a bumblebee,
p57
aVand you'll be mimicking the warning systems
p58
aVof most marine species."
p59
aVI didn't think about that much at the time,
p60
aVand it wasn't until the next three fatal shark attacks happened,
p61
aVand it caused me to think,
p62
aVmaybe there's some merit to this idea.
p63
aVAnd I turned to the web
p64
aVto see if there might be some clues.
p65
aa(lp66
VAnd it turns out the web is awash
p67
aVwith this sort of evidence that supports
p68
aVthis sort of thinking.
p69
aVSo biologically, there are plenty of species
p70
aVthat display banding or patterns, warning patterns,
p71
aVto either be cryptical in the water
p72
aVor warn against being attacked,
p73
aVnot the least of which is the pilot fish
p74
aVwhich spends a big slab of its life
p75
aVaround the business end of a shark.
p76
aVOn the human side, Walter Starck, an oceanographer,
p77
aVhas been painting his wetsuit since the 1970s,
p78
aVand anthropologically,
p79
aVPacific island tribes painted themselves in bands
p80
aVin a sea snake ceremony
p81
aVto ward off the shark god.
p82
aa(lp83
VSo what's going on here?
p84
aVIs this an idea lying wide out in the open
p85
aVfor us to consider and define?
p86
aVWe know that sharks use a range of sensors
p87
aVwhen they engage, particularly for attack,
p88
aVbut the sight sensor is the one that they use
p89
aVto identify the target, and particularly
p90
aVin the last number of meters before the attack.
p91
aVIt makes sense to pay attention to the biological anecdote
p92
aVbecause that's time-tested evolution
p93
aVover many millennia.
p94
aVBut isn't human anecdote also an evolution of sorts,
p95
aVthe idea that there's a kernel of truth
p96
aVthought to be important,
p97
aVpassed down from generation to generation,
p98
aVso that it actually ends up shaping human behavior?
p99
aa(lp100
VI wanted to test this idea.
p101
aVI wanted to put some science
p102
aVto this anecdotal evidence,
p103
aVbecause if science could support this concept,
p104
aVthen we might have at least part of the solution
p105
aVto shark attack right under our very nose.
p106
aVTo do that, I needed some experts
p107
aVin shark vision and shark neurology,
p108
aVand a worldwide search, again,
p109
aVled to the University of W.A.
p110
aVon the doorstep here, with the Oceans Institute.
p111
aVAnd professor Nathan Hart and his team
p112
aVhad just written a paper which tells us,
p113
aVconfirms that predatory sharks see
p114
aVin black and white, or grayscale.
p115
aVSo I called up Nathan,
p116
aVa little bit sheepishly, actually, about this idea
p117
aVthat maybe we could use these patterns and shapes
p118
aVto produce a wetsuit to try and mitigate the risk of shark attack,
p119
aVand fortunately, he thought that was a good idea.
p120
aVSo what ensued is a collaborative bit of research
p121
aVsupported by the West Australian State Government.
p122
aVAnd we did three key things.
p123
aVThe first is that we mapped the characteristics,
p124
aVthe physical characteristics of the eyes
p125
aVof the three main predatory sharks,
p126
aVso the great white, tiger and bull shark.
p127
aVWe did that genetically
p128
aVand we did that anatomically.
p129
aVThe next thing we did was to understand,
p130
aVusing complex computer modeling,
p131
aVwhat that eye can see
p132
aVat different depths, distances,
p133
aVlight conditions, and water clarity in the ocean.
p134
aVAnd from there, we were able to pinpoint
p135
aVtwo key characteristics:
p136
aVwhat patterns and shapes would present the wearer
p137
aVas hidden or hard to make out in the water, cryptic,
p138
aVand what patterns and shapes might provide
p139
aVthe greatest contrast but provide the greatest
p140
aVbreakup of profile
p141
aVso that that person wasn't confused for shark prey
p142
aVor shark food.
p143
aa(lp144
VThe next thing we needed to do was to convert this
p145
aVinto wetsuits that people might actually wear,
p146
aVand to that end, I invited Ray Smith,
p147
aVa surfer, industrial designer, wetsuit designer,
p148
aVand in fact the guy that designed the original Quiksilver logo,
p149
aVto come over and sit with the science team
p150
aVand interpret that science
p151
aVinto aesthetic wetsuits that people might actually wear.
p152
aVAnd here's an example of one of the first drawings.
p153
aVSo this is what I call a "don't eat me" wetsuit.
p154
aVSo this takes that banding idea,
p155
aVtakes that banding idea, it's highly visible,
p156
aVprovides a highly disruptive profile,
p157
aVand is intended to prevent the shark
p158
aVfrom considering that you would be ordinary food,
p159
aVand potentially even create confusion for the shark.
p160
aVAnd this one's configured to go with a surfboard.
p161
aVYou can see that dark, opaque panel on the front,
p162
aVand it's particularly better for the surface,
p163
aVwhere being backlit and providing a silhouette
p164
aVis problematic.
p165
aVSecond iteration is the cryptic wetsuit,
p166
aVor the one which attempts to hide the wearer
p167
aVin the water column.
p168
aVThere are three panels on this suit,
p169
aVand in any given conditions,
p170
aVone or more of those panels
p171
aVwill match the reflective spectra of the water
p172
aVso as to disappear fully or partially,
p173
aVleaving the last panel or panels
p174
aVto create a disruptive profile in the water column.
p175
aVAnd this one's particularly well-suited
p176
aVto the dive configuration,
p177
aVso when you're deeper under the water.
p178
aa(lp179
VSo we knew that we had
p180
aVsome really solid science here.
p181
aVWe knew, if you wanted to stand out,
p182
aVyou needed to look stripy,
p183
aVand we knew if you wanted to be cryptic,
p184
aVyou needed to look like this.
p185
aVBut the acid test is always going to be,
p186
aVhow would sharks really behave
p187
aVin the context of these patterns and shapes.
p188
aVAnd testing to simulate a person in a wetsuit
p189
aVin the water with a predatory shark
p190
aVin a natural environment
p191
aVis actually a lot harder than you might think.
p192
aV(Laughter)
p193
aa(lp194
VSo we have to bait the rig,
p195
aVbecause we need to get the statistical number
p196
aVof samples through to get the scientific evidence,
p197
aVand by baiting the rig,
p198
aVwe're obviously changing shark behavior.
p199
aVWe can't put humans in the water.
p200
aVWe're ethically precluded from even using
p201
aVhumanoid shapes and baiting them up in the water.
p202
aVBut nevertheless, we started the testing process
p203
aVin January of this year,
p204
aVinitially with tiger sharks
p205
aVand subsequently with great white sharks.
p206
aVThe way we did that
p207
aVwas to get a perforated drum which is full of bait,
p208
aVwrap it in a neoprene skin,
p209
aVand then run two stereo underwater cameras
p210
aVto watch how the shark actually engages with that rig.
p211
aVAnd because we use stereo,
p212
aVwe can capture all the statistics on how big the shark is,
p213
aVwhat angle it comes in at, how quickly it leaves,
p214
aVand what its behavior is
p215
aVin an empirical rather than a subjective way.
p216
aVBecause we needed to preserve the scientific method,
p217
aVwe ran a control rig
p218
aVwhich was a black neoprene rig
p219
aVjust like a normal black wetsuit
p220
aVagainst the, what we call,
p221
aVSAMS technology rig.
p222
aVAnd the results were not just exciting,
p223
aVbut very encouraging,
p224
aVand today I would like to just give you a snapshot
p225
aVof two of those engagements.
p226
aa(lp227
VSo here we've got a four-meter tiger shark
p228
aVengaging the black control rig,
p229
aVwhich it had encountered about
p230
aVa minute and a half before.
p231
aVNow that exact same shark had engaged,
p232
aVor encountered this SAMS rig,
p233
aVwhich is the Elude SAMS rig,
p234
aVabout eight minutes before,
p235
aVand spent six minutes circling it, hunting for it,
p236
aVlooking for what it could smell and sense but not see,
p237
aVand this was the final engagement.
p238
aVGreat white sharks are more confident than the tigers,
p239
aVand here you see great white shark
p240
aVengaging a control rig,
p241
aVso a black neoprene wetsuit,
p242
aVand going straight to the bottom,
p243
aVcoming up
p244
aVand engaging.
p245
aVIn contrast to the SAMS technology rig,
p246
aVthis is the banded one,
p247
aVwhere it's more tactile,
p248
aVit's more investigative,
p249
aVit's more apprehensive,
p250
aVand shows a reluctance to come straight in and go.
p251
aV(Applause)
p252
aa(lp253
VSo, it's important for us that all  the testing is done independently,
p254
aVand the University of W.A. is doing the testing.
p255
aVIt'll be an ongoing process.
p256
aVIt's subject to peer review and subject to publication.
p257
aVIt's so important that this concept
p258
aVis led with the science.
p259
aVFrom the perspective of Shark  Attack Mitigation Systems,
p260
aVwe're a biotechnology licensing company,
p261
aVso we don't make wetsuits ourselves.
p262
aVWe'll license others to do that.
p263
aa(lp264
VBut I thought you might be interested
p265
aVin seeing what SAMS technology looks like
p266
aVembedded in a wetsuit, and to that end,
p267
aVfor the first time, live, worldwide \u2014
p268
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p269
aVI can show you what biological adaptation,
p270
aVscience and design looks like in real life.
p271
aVSo I can welcome Sam, the surfer,
p272
aVfrom this side. Where are you, Sam?
p273
aV(Applause)
p274
aVAnd Eduardo.
p275
aV(Applause)
p276
aVCheers, mate.
p277
aVCheers.
p278
aVThanks, gentlemen. (Applause)
p279
aa(lp280
VSo what have we done here?
p281
aVWell, to my mind, rather than take a blank sheet
p282
aVand use science as a tool for invention,
p283
aVwe've paid attention to the biological evidence,
p284
aVwe've put importance to the
p285
aVhuman anecdotal evidence,
p286
aVand we've used science as a tool
p287
aVfor translation,
p288
aVtranslation of something that was already there
p289
aVinto something that we can  use for the benefit of mankind.
p290
aVAnd it strikes me that this idea of science
p291
aVas a tool for translation rather than invention
p292
aVis one that we can apply much more widely than this
p293
aVin the pursuit of innovation.
p294
aVAfter all, did the Wright brothers
p295
aVdiscover manned flight,
p296
aVor did they observe the biological fact of flight
p297
aVand translate that mechanically, replicate it
p298
aVin a way that humans could use?
p299
aVAs for the humble wetsuit,
p300
aVwho knows what oceanwear will look like
p301
aVin two years' time, in five years' time
p302
aVor in 50 years' time, but with this new thinking,
p303
aVI'm guessing there's a fair chance
p304
aVit won't be pure black.
p305
aa(lp306
