VAll right. So, like all good stories,
p4
aVthis starts a long, long time ago
p5
aVwhen there was basically nothing.
p6
aVSo here is a complete picture of the universe
p7
aVabout 14-odd billion years ago.
p8
aVAll energy is concentrated into a single point of energy.
p9
aVFor some reason it explodes,
p10
aVand you begin to get these things.
p11
aVSo you're now about 14 billion years into this.
p12
aVAnd these things expand and expand and expand
p13
aVinto these giant galaxies,
p14
aVand you get trillions of them.
p15
aVAnd within these galaxies
p16
aVyou get these enormous dust clouds.
p17
aVAnd I want you to pay particular attention
p18
aVto the three little prongs
p19
aa(lp20
Vin the center of this picture.
p21
aVIf you take a close-up of those,
p22
aVthey look like this.
p23
aVAnd what you're looking at is columns of dust
p24
aVwhere there's so much dust \u2014
p25
aVby the way, the scale of this is a trillion vertical miles \u2014
p26
aVand what's happening is there's so much dust,
p27
aVit comes together and it fuses
p28
aVand ignites a thermonuclear reaction.
p29
aVAnd so what you're watching
p30
aVis the birth of stars.
p31
aVThese are stars being born out of here.
p32
aVWhen enough stars come out,
p33
aVthey create a galaxy.
p34
aVThis one happens to be a particularly important galaxy,
p35
aVbecause you are here.
p36
aV(Laughter)
p37
aVAnd as you take a close-up of this galaxy,
p38
aVyou find a relatively normal,
p39
aVnot particularly interesting star.
p40
aa(lp41
VBy the way, you're now about two-thirds of the way into this story.
p42
aVSo this star doesn't even appear
p43
aVuntil about two-thirds of the way into this story.
p44
aVAnd then what happens
p45
aVis there's enough dust left over
p46
aVthat it doesn't ignite into a star,
p47
aVit becomes a planet.
p48
aVAnd this is about a little over four billion years ago.
p49
aa(lp50
VAnd soon thereafter
p51
aVthere's enough material left over
p52
aVthat you get a primordial soup,
p53
aVand that creates life.
p54
aVAnd life starts to expand and expand and expand,
p55
aVuntil it goes kaput.
p56
aa(lp57
V(Laughter)
p58
aa(lp59
VNow the really strange thing
p60
aVis life goes kaput, not once, not twice,
p61
aVbut five times.
p62
aVSo almost all life on Earth
p63
aVis wiped out about five times.
p64
aVAnd as you're thinking about that,
p65
aVwhat happens is you get more and more complexity,
p66
aVmore and more stuff
p67
aVto build new things with.
p68
aVAnd we don't appear
p69
aVuntil about 99.96 percent of the time into this story,
p70
aVjust to put ourselves and our ancestors in perspective.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo within that context, there's two theories of the case
p73
aVas to why we're all here.
p74
aVThe first theory of the case
p75
aVis that's all she wrote.
p76
aVUnder that theory,
p77
aVwe are the be-all and end-all
p78
aVof all creation.
p79
aVAnd the reason for trillions of galaxies,
p80
aVsextillions of planets,
p81
aVis to create something that looks like that
p82
aVand something that looks like that.
p83
aVAnd that's the purpose of the universe;
p84
aVand then it flat-lines,
p85
aVit doesn't get any better.
p86
aa(lp87
V(Laughter)
p88
aa(lp89
VThe only question you might want to ask yourself is,
p90
aVcould that be just mildly arrogant?
p91
aVAnd if it is \u2014
p92
aVand particularly given the fact that we came very close to extinction.
p93
aVThere were only about 2,000 of our species left.
p94
aVA few more weeks without rain,
p95
aVwe would have never seen any of these.
p96
aa(lp97
V(Laughter)
p98
aa(lp99
V(Applause)
p100
aa(lp101
VSo maybe you have to think about a second theory
p102
aVif the first one isn't good enough.
p103
aVSecond theory is: Could we upgrade?
p104
aV(Laughter)
p105
aVWell, why would one ask a question like that?
p106
aVBecause there have been at least 29 upgrades so far
p107
aVof humanoids.
p108
aVSo it turns out that we have upgraded.
p109
aVWe've upgraded time and again and again.
p110
aVAnd it turns out that we keep discovering upgrades.
p111
aVWe found this one last year.
p112
aVWe found another one last month.
p113
aa(lp114
VAnd as you're thinking about this,
p115
aVyou might also ask the question:
p116
aVSo why a single human species?
p117
aVWouldn't it be really odd
p118
aVif you went to Africa and Asia and Antarctica
p119
aVand found exactly the same bird \u2014
p120
aVparticularly given that we co-existed at the same time
p121
aVwith at least eight other versions of humanoid
p122
aVat the same time on this planet?
p123
aVSo the normal state of affairs
p124
aVis not to have just a Homo sapiens;
p125
aVthe normal state of affairs
p126
aVis to have various versions of humans walking around.
p127
aa(lp128
VAnd if that is the normal state of affairs,
p129
aVthen you might ask yourself,
p130
aVall right, so if we want to create something else,
p131
aVhow big does a mutation have to be?
p132
aVWell Svante Paabo has the answer.
p133
aVThe difference between humans and Neanderthal
p134
aVis 0.004 percent of gene code.
p135
aVThat's how big the difference is
p136
aVone species to another.
p137
aVThis explains most contemporary political debates.
p138
aa(lp139
V(Laughter)
p140
aa(lp141
VBut as you're thinking about this,
p142
aVone of the interesting things
p143
aVis how small these mutations are and where they take place.
p144
aVDifference human/Neanderthal
p145
aVis sperm and testis,
p146
aVsmell and skin.
p147
aVAnd those are the specific genes
p148
aVthat differ from one to the other.
p149
aVSo very small changes can have a big impact.
p150
aa(lp151
VAnd as you're thinking about this,
p152
aVwe're continuing to mutate.
p153
aVSo about 10,000 years ago by the Black Sea,
p154
aVwe had one mutation in one gene
p155
aVwhich led to blue eyes.
p156
aVAnd this is continuing and continuing and continuing.
p157
aa(lp158
VAnd as it continues,
p159
aVone of the things that's going to happen this year
p160
aVis we're going to discover the first 10,000 human genomes,
p161
aVbecause it's gotten cheap enough to do the gene sequencing.
p162
aVAnd when we find these,
p163
aVwe may find differences.
p164
aa(lp165
VAnd by the way, this is not a debate that we're ready for,
p166
aVbecause we have really misused the science in this.
p167
aVIn the 1920s, we thought there were major differences between people.
p168
aVThat was partly based on Francis Galton's work.
p169
aVHe was Darwin's cousin.
p170
aVBut the U.S., the Carnegie Institute,
p171
aVStanford, American Neurological Association
p172
aVtook this really far.
p173
aVThat got exported and was really misused.
p174
aVIn fact, it led to some absolutely horrendous
p175
aVtreatment of human beings.
p176
aVSo since the 1940s, we've been saying there are no differences,
p177
aVwe're all identical.
p178
aVWe're going to know at year end if that is true.
p179
aa(lp180
VAnd as we think about that,
p181
aVwe're actually beginning to find things
p182
aVlike, do you have an ACE gene?
p183
aVWhy would that matter?
p184
aVBecause nobody's ever climbed an 8,000-meter peak without oxygen
p185
aVthat doesn't have an ACE gene.
p186
aVAnd if you want to get more specific,
p187
aVhow about a 577R genotype?
p188
aVWell it turns out that every male Olympic power athelete ever tested
p189
aVcarries at least one of these variants.
p190
aa(lp191
VIf that is true,
p192
aVit leads to some very complicated questions
p193
aVfor the London Olympics.
p194
aVThree options:
p195
aVDo you want the Olympics to be a showcase
p196
aVfor really hardworking mutants?
p197
aV(Laughter)
p198
aVOption number two:
p199
aVWhy don't we play it like golf or sailing?
p200
aVBecause you have one and you don't have one,
p201
aVI'll give you a tenth of a second head start.
p202
aVVersion number three:
p203
aVBecause this is a naturally occurring gene
p204
aVand you've got it and you didn't pick the right parents,
p205
aVyou get the right to upgrade.
p206
aVThree different options.
p207
aVIf these differences are the difference
p208
aVbetween an Olympic medal and a non-Olympic medal.
p209
aa(lp210
VAnd it turns out that as we discover these things,
p211
aVwe human beings really like to change
p212
aVhow we look, how we act,
p213
aVwhat our bodies do.
p214
aVAnd we had about 10.2 million plastic surgeries in the United States,
p215
aVexcept that with the technologies that are coming online today,
p216
aVtoday's corrections, deletions,
p217
aVaugmentations and enhancements
p218
aVare going to seem like child's play.
p219
aa(lp220
VYou already saw the work by Tony Atala on TED,
p221
aVbut this ability to start filling
p222
aVthings like inkjet cartridges with cells
p223
aVare allowing us to print skin, organs
p224
aVand a whole series of other body parts.
p225
aVAnd as these technologies go forward,
p226
aVyou keep seeing this, you keep seeing this, you keep seeing things \u2014
p227
aV2000, human genome sequence \u2014
p228
aVand it seems like nothing's happening,
p229
aVuntil it does.
p230
aVAnd we may just be in some of these weeks.
p231
aa(lp232
VAnd as you're thinking about
p233
aVthese two guys sequencing a human genome in 2000
p234
aVand the Public Project sequencing the human genome in 2000,
p235
aVthen you don't hear a lot,
p236
aVuntil you hear about an experiment last year in China,
p237
aVwhere they take skin cells from this mouse,
p238
aVput four chemicals on it,
p239
aVturn those skin cells into stem cells,
p240
aVlet the stem cells grow
p241
aVand create a full copy of that mouse.
p242
aa(lp243
VThat's a big deal.
p244
aVBecause in essence
p245
aVwhat it means is you can take a cell,
p246
aVwhich is a pluripotent stem cell,
p247
aVwhich is like a skier at the top of a mountain,
p248
aVand those two skiers become two pluripotent stem cells,
p249
aVfour, eight, 16,
p250
aVand then it gets so crowded
p251
aVafter 16 divisions
p252
aVthat those cells have to differentiate.
p253
aVSo they go down one side of the mountain,
p254
aVthey go down another.
p255
aVAnd as they pick that,
p256
aVthese become bone,
p257
aVand then they pick another road and these become platelets,
p258
aVand these become macrophages,
p259
aVand these become T cells.
p260
aVBut it's really hard, once you ski down,
p261
aVto get back up.
p262
aVUnless, of course, if you have a ski lift.
p263
aVAnd what those four chemicals do
p264
aVis they take any cell
p265
aVand take it way back up the mountain
p266
aVso it can become any body part.
p267
aa(lp268
VAnd as you think of that,
p269
aVwhat it means is potentially
p270
aVyou can rebuild a full copy
p271
aVof any organism
p272
aVout of any one of its cells.
p273
aVThat turns out to be a big deal
p274
aVbecause now you can take, not just mouse cells,
p275
aVbut you can human skin cells
p276
aVand turn them into human stem cells.
p277
aVAnd then what they did in October
p278
aVis they took skin cells, turned them into stem cells
p279
aVand began to turn them into liver cells.
p280
aVSo in theory,
p281
aVyou could grow any organ from any one of your cells.
p282
aa(lp283
VHere's a second experiment:
p284
aVIf you could photocopy your body,
p285
aVmaybe you also want to take your mind.
p286
aVAnd one of the things you saw at TED
p287
aVabout a year and a half ago
p288
aVwas this guy.
p289
aVAnd he gave a wonderful technical talk.
p290
aVHe's a professor at MIT.
p291
aVBut in essence what he said
p292
aVis you can take retroviruses,
p293
aVwhich get inside brain cells of mice.
p294
aVYou can tag them with proteins
p295
aVthat light up when you light them.
p296
aVAnd you can map the exact pathways
p297
aVwhen a mouse sees, feels, touches,
p298
aVremembers, loves.
p299
aVAnd then you can take a fiber optic cable
p300
aVand light up some of the same things.
p301
aVAnd by the way, as you do this,
p302
aVyou can image it in two colors,
p303
aVwhich means you can download this information
p304
aVas binary code directly into a computer.
p305
aa(lp306
VSo what's the bottom line on that?
p307
aVWell it's not completely inconceivable
p308
aVthat someday you'll be able to download your own memories,
p309
aVmaybe into a new body.
p310
aVAnd maybe you can upload other people's memories as well.
p311
aVAnd this might have just one or two
p312
aVsmall ethical, political, moral implications.
p313
aV(Laughter)
p314
aVJust a thought.
p315
aa(lp316
VHere's the kind of questions
p317
aVthat are becoming interesting questions
p318
aVfor philosophers, for governing people,
p319
aVfor economists, for scientists.
p320
aVBecause these technologies are moving really quickly.
p321
aa(lp322
VAnd as you think about it,
p323
aVlet me close with an example of the brain.
p324
aVThe first place where you would expect
p325
aVto see enormous evolutionary pressure today,
p326
aVboth because of the inputs,
p327
aVwhich are becoming massive,
p328
aVand because of the plasticity of the organ,
p329
aVis the brain.
p330
aa(lp331
VDo we have any evidence that that is happening?
p332
aVWell let's take a look at something like autism incidence per thousand.
p333
aVHere's what it looks like in 2000.
p334
aVHere's what it looks like in 2002,
p335
aV2006, 2008.
p336
aVHere's the increase in less than a decade.
p337
aVAnd we still don't know why this is happening.
p338
aVWhat we do know is, potentially,
p339
aVthe brain is reacting in
p340
aVa hyperactive, hyper-plastic way,
p341
aVand creating individuals that are like this.
p342
aVAnd this is only one of the conditions that's out there.
p343
aVYou've also got people with who are extraordinarily smart,
p344
aVpeople who can remember everything they've seen in their lives,
p345
aVpeople who've got synesthesia,
p346
aVpeople who've got schizophrenia.
p347
aVYou've got all kinds of stuff going on out there,
p348
aVand we still don't understand
p349
aVhow and why this is happening.
p350
aa(lp351
VBut one question you might want to ask is,
p352
aVare we seeing a rapid evolution of the brain
p353
aVand of how we process data?
p354
aVBecause when you think of how much data's coming into our brains,
p355
aVwe're trying to take in as much data in a day
p356
aVas people used to take in in a lifetime.
p357
aVAnd as you're thinking about this,
p358
aVthere's four theories as to why this might be going on,
p359
aVplus a whole series of others.
p360
aVI don't have a good answer.
p361
aVThere really needs to be more research on this.
p362
aa(lp363
VOne option is the fast food fetish.
p364
aVThere's beginning to be some evidence
p365
aVthat obesity and diet
p366
aVhave something to do
p367
aVwith gene modifications,
p368
aVwhich may or may not have an impact
p369
aVon how the brain of an infant works.
p370
aa(lp371
VA second option is the sexy geek option.
p372
aVThese conditions are highly rare.
p373
aV(Laughter)
p374
aV(Applause)
p375
aVBut what's beginning to happen
p376
aVis because these geeks are all getting together,
p377
aVbecause they are highly qualified for computer programming
p378
aVand it is highly remunerated,
p379
aVas well as other very detail-oriented tasks,
p380
aVthat they are concentrating geographically
p381
aVand finding like-minded mates.
p382
aVSo this is the assortative mating hypothesis
p383
aVof these genes reinforcing one another
p384
aVin these structures.
p385
aa(lp386
VThe third, is this too much information?
p387
aVWe're trying to process so much stuff
p388
aVthat some people get synesthetic
p389
aVand just have huge pipes that remember everything.
p390
aVOther people get hyper-sensitive to the amount of information.
p391
aVOther people react with various psychological conditions
p392
aVor reactions to this information.
p393
aVOr maybe it's chemicals.
p394
aa(lp395
VBut when you see an increase
p396
aVof that order of magnitude in a condition,
p397
aVeither you're not measuring it right
p398
aVor there's something going on very quickly,
p399
aVand it may be evolution in real time.
p400
aa(lp401
VHere's the bottom line.
p402
aVWhat I think we are doing
p403
aVis we're transitioning as a species.
p404
aVAnd I didn't think this when Steve Gullans and I started writing together.
p405
aVI think we're transitioning into Homo evolutis
p406
aVthat, for better or worse,
p407
aVis not just a hominid that's conscious of his or her environment,
p408
aVit's a hominid that's beginning to directly and deliberately
p409
aVcontrol the evolution of its own species,
p410
aVof bacteria, of plants, of animals.
p411
aVAnd I think that's such an order of magnitude change
p412
aVthat your grandkids or your great-grandkids
p413
aVmay be a species very different from you.
p414
aa(lp415
