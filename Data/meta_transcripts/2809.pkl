VI remember when I first found out
p4
aVI was going to speak at a TED conference.
p5
aVI ran across the hall to one of my classrooms
p6
aVto inform my students.
p7
aa(lp8
V"Guess what, guys?
p9
aVI've been asked to give a TED Talk."
p10
aa(lp11
VThe reaction wasn't one I quite expected.
p12
aVThe whole room went silent.
p13
aa(lp14
V"A TED Talk? You mean, like the one you made us watch on grit?
p15
aVOr the one with the scientist that did this really awesome thing with robots?"
p16
aVMuhammad asked.
p17
aa(lp18
V"Yes, just like that."
p19
aa(lp20
V"But Coach, those people are really important and smart."
p21
aa(lp22
V(Laughter)
p23
aa(lp24
V"I know that."
p25
aa(lp26
V"But Coach, why are you speaking? You hate public speaking."
p27
aa(lp28
V"I do," I admitted,
p29
aV"But it's important that I speak about us, that I speak about your journeys,
p30
aVabout my journey.
p31
aVPeople need to know."
p32
aa(lp33
VThe students at the all-refugee school that I founded
p34
aVdecided to end with some words of encouragement.
p35
aa(lp36
V"Cool! It better be good, Coach."
p37
aa(lp38
V(Laughter)
p39
aa(lp40
VThere are 65.3 million people who have been forcibly displaced
p41
aVfrom their homes because of war or persecution.
p42
aVThe largest number, 11 million, are from Syria.
p43
aV33,952 people flee their homes daily.
p44
aVThe vast majority remain in refugee camps,
p45
aVwhose conditions cannot be defined as humane under anyone's definition.
p46
aVWe are participating in the degradation of humans.
p47
aVNever have we had numbers this high.
p48
aVThis is the highest number of refugees since World War II.
p49
aa(lp50
VNow, let me tell you why this issue is so important to me.
p51
aVI am an Arab. I am an immigrant.
p52
aVI am a Muslim.
p53
aVI've also spent the last 12 years of my life working with refugees.
p54
aVOh \u2014 and I'm also gay.
p55
aVIt makes me really popular these days.
p56
aa(lp57
V(Laughter)
p58
aa(lp59
VBut I am the daughter of a refugee.
p60
aVMy grandmother fled Syria in 1964 during the first Assad regime.
p61
aVShe was three months pregnant when she packed up a suitcase,
p62
aVpiled in her five children and drove to neighboring Jordan,
p63
aVnot knowing what the future held for her and her family.
p64
aVMy grandfather decided to stay, not believing it was that bad.
p65
aVHe followed her a month later, after his brothers were tortured
p66
aVand his factory was taken over by the government.
p67
aVThey rebuilt their lives starting from scratch
p68
aVand eventually became independently wealthy Jordanian citizens.
p69
aa(lp70
VI was born in Jordan 11 years later.
p71
aVIt was really important to my grandmother for us to know our history
p72
aVand our journey.
p73
aVI was eight years old when she took me to visit my first refugee camp.
p74
aVI didn't understand why.
p75
aVI didn't know why it was so important to her
p76
aVfor us to go.
p77
aVI remember walking into the camp holding her hand,
p78
aVand her saying, "Go play with the kids,"
p79
aVwhile she visited with the women in the camp.
p80
aVI didn't want to.
p81
aVThese kids weren't like me.
p82
aVThey were poor. They lived in a camp.
p83
aVI refused.
p84
aVShe knelt down beside me and firmly said, "Go.
p85
aVAnd don't come back until you've played.
p86
aVDon't ever think people are beneath you
p87
aVor that you have nothing to learn from others."
p88
aa(lp89
VI reluctantly went.
p90
aVI never wanted to disappoint my grandmother.
p91
aVI returned a few hours later,
p92
aVhaving spent some time playing soccer with the kids in the camp.
p93
aVWe walked out of the camp,
p94
aVand I was excitedly telling her what a great time I had
p95
aVand how fantastic the kids were.
p96
aa(lp97
V"Haram!" I said in Arabic. "Poor them."
p98
aa(lp99
V"Haram on us," she said, using the word's different meaning,
p100
aVthat we were sinning.
p101
aV"Don't feel sorry for them; believe in them."
p102
aa(lp103
VIt wasn't until I left my country of origin for the United States
p104
aVthat I realized the impact of her words.
p105
aa(lp106
VAfter my college graduation, I applied for and was granted political asylum,
p107
aVbased on being a member of a social group.
p108
aVSome people may not realize this,
p109
aVbut you can still get the death penalty in some countries for being gay.
p110
aVI had to give up my Jordanian citizenship.
p111
aVThat was the hardest decision I've ever had to make,
p112
aVbut I had no other choice.
p113
aVThe point is,
p114
aVwhen you find yourself choosing between home and survival,
p115
aVthe question "Where are you from?" becomes very loaded.
p116
aVA Syrian woman who I recently met at a refugee camp in Greece
p117
aVarticulated it best,
p118
aVwhen she recalled the exact moment she realized she had to flee Aleppo.
p119
aa(lp120
V"I looked out the window and there was nothing.
p121
aVIt was all rubble.
p122
aVThere were no stores, no streets, no schools. Everything was gone.
p123
aVI had been in my apartment for months,
p124
aVlistening to bombs drop and watching people die.
p125
aVBut I always thought it would get better,
p126
aVthat no one could force me to leave,
p127
aVno one could take my home away from me.
p128
aVAnd I don't know why it was that morning, but when I looked outside,
p129
aVI realized if I didn't leave, my three young children would die.
p130
aVAnd so we left.
p131
aVWe left because we had to, not because we wanted to.
p132
aVThere was no choice," she said.
p133
aa(lp134
VIt's kind of hard to believe that you belong
p135
aVwhen you don't have a home,
p136
aVwhen your country of origin rejects you because of fear or persecution,
p137
aVor the city that you grew up in is completely destroyed.
p138
aVI didn't feel like I had a home.
p139
aVI was no longer a Jordanian citizen,
p140
aVbut I wasn't American, either.
p141
aVI felt a kind of loneliness
p142
aVthat is still hard to put into words today.
p143
aa(lp144
VAfter college, I desperately needed to find a place to call home.
p145
aVI bounced around from state to state
p146
aVand eventually ended up in North Carolina.
p147
aVKindhearted people who felt sorry for me
p148
aVoffered to pay rent
p149
aVor buy me a meal or a suit for my new interview.
p150
aVIt just made me feel more isolated and incapable.
p151
aVIt wasn't until I met Miss Sarah,
p152
aVa Southern Baptist who took me in at my lowest and gave me a job,
p153
aVthat I started to believe in myself.
p154
aVMiss Sarah owned a diner in the mountains of North Carolina.
p155
aVI assumed, because of my privileged upbringing
p156
aVand my Seven Sister education,
p157
aVthat she would ask me to manage the restaurant.
p158
aVI was wrong.
p159
aVI started off washing dishes,
p160
aVcleaning toilets and working the grill.
p161
aVI was humbled; I was shown the value of hard work.
p162
aVBut most importantly, I felt valued and embraced.
p163
aVI celebrated Christmas with her family,
p164
aVand she attempted to observe Ramadan with me.
p165
aa(lp166
VI remember being very nervous about coming out to her \u2014
p167
aVafter all, she was a Southern Baptist.
p168
aVI sat on the couch next to her
p169
aVand I said, "Miss Sarah, you know that I'm gay."
p170
aVHer response is one that I will never forget.
p171
aa(lp172
V"That's fine, honey. Just don't be a slut."
p173
aa(lp174
V(Laughter)
p175
aa(lp176
V(Applause)
p177
aa(lp178
VI eventually moved to Atlanta, still trying to find my home.
p179
aVMy journey took a strange turn three years later,
p180
aVafter I met a group of refugee kids playing soccer outside.
p181
aVI'd made a wrong turn into this apartment complex,
p182
aVand I saw these kids outside playing soccer.
p183
aVThey were playing barefoot with a raggedy soccer ball
p184
aVand rocks set up as goals.
p185
aVI watched them for about an hour,
p186
aVand after that I was smiling.
p187
aVThe boys reminded me of home.
p188
aVThey reminded me of the way I grew up playing soccer
p189
aVin the streets of Jordan, with my brothers and cousins.
p190
aVI eventually joined their game.
p191
aVThey were a little skeptical about letting me join it,
p192
aVbecause according to them, girls don't know how to play.
p193
aVBut obviously I did.
p194
aa(lp195
VI asked them if they had ever played on a team.
p196
aVThey said they hadn't, but that they would love to.
p197
aVI gradually won them over, and we formed our first team.
p198
aVThis group of kids would give me a crash course in refugees, poverty
p199
aVand humanity.
p200
aVThree brothers from Afghanistan \u2014 Roohullah, Noorullah and Zabiullah \u2014
p201
aVplayed a major role in that.
p202
aVI showed up late to practice one day to find the field completely deserted.
p203
aVI was really worried.
p204
aVMy team loved to practice.
p205
aVIt wasn't like them to miss practice.
p206
aVI got out of my car, and two kids ran out from behind a dumpster,
p207
aVwaving their hands frantically.
p208
aa(lp209
V"Coach, Rooh got beat up. He got jumped.
p210
aVThere was blood everywhere."
p211
aa(lp212
V"What do you mean? What do you mean he got beat up?"
p213
aa(lp214
V"These bad kids came and beat him up, Coach.
p215
aVEverybody left. They were all scared."
p216
aa(lp217
VWe hopped into my car and drove over to Rooh's apartment.
p218
aVI knocked on the door, and Noor opened it.
p219
aV"Where's Rooh? I need to talk to him, see if he's OK."
p220
aV"He's in his room, Coach. He's refusing to come out."
p221
aVI knocked on the door.
p222
aa(lp223
V"Rooh, come on out. I need to talk to you.
p224
aVI need to see if you're OK or if we need to go to the hospital."
p225
aa(lp226
VHe came out.
p227
aVHe had a big gash on his head, a split lip,
p228
aVand he was physically shaken.
p229
aVI was looking at him,
p230
aVand I asked the boys to call for their mom,
p231
aVbecause I needed to go to the hospital with him.
p232
aVThey called for their mom.
p233
aVShe came out.
p234
aVI had my back turned to her, and she started screaming in Farsi.
p235
aVThe boys fell to the ground laughing.
p236
aVI was very confused,
p237
aVbecause there was nothing funny about this.
p238
aVThey explained to me that she said,
p239
aa(lp240
V"You told me your coach was a Muslim and a woman."
p241
aVFrom behind, I didn't appear to be either to her.
p242
aa(lp243
V(Laughter)
p244
aa(lp245
V"I am Muslim," I said, turning to her.
p246
aV"A\u0161hadu \u02bean l\u0101 \u02beil\u0101ha \u02beilla (A)ll\u0101h,"
p247
aVreciting the Muslim declaration of faith.
p248
aVConfused,
p249
aVand perhaps maybe a little bit reassured,
p250
aVshe realized that yes,
p251
aVI, this American-acting, shorts-wearing, non-veiled woman,
p252
aVwas indeed a Muslim.
p253
aa(lp254
VTheir family had fled the Taliban.
p255
aVHundreds of people in their village
p256
aVwere murdered.
p257
aVTheir father was taken in by the Taliban,
p258
aVonly to return a few months later, a shell of the man he once was.
p259
aVThe family escaped to Pakistan,
p260
aVand the two older boys, age eight and 10 at the time,
p261
aVwove rugs for 10 hours a day to provide for their family.
p262
aVThey were so excited when they found out that they had been approved
p263
aVto resettle in the United States,
p264
aVmaking them the lucky 0.1 percent who get to do that.
p265
aVThey had hit the jackpot.
p266
aa(lp267
VTheir story is not unique.
p268
aVEvery refugee family I have worked with has had some version of this.
p269
aVI work with kids
p270
aVwho have seen their mothers raped, their fathers' fingers sliced off.
p271
aVOne kid saw a bullet put in his grandmother's head,
p272
aVbecause she refused to let the rebels take him to be a child soldier.
p273
aVTheir journeys are haunting.
p274
aVBut what I get to see every day is hope, resilience, determination,
p275
aVa love of life
p276
aVand appreciation for being able to rebuild their lives.
p277
aa(lp278
VI was at the boys' apartment one night,
p279
aVwhen the mom came home after cleaning 18 hotel rooms in one day.
p280
aVShe sat down, and Noor rubbed her feet,
p281
aVsaying that he was going to take care of her once he graduated.
p282
aVShe smiled from exhaustion.
p283
aV"God is good. Life is good. We are lucky to be here."
p284
aa(lp285
VIn the last two years, we have seen an escalating anti-refugee sentiment.
p286
aVIt's global.
p287
aVThe numbers continue to grow because we do nothing to prevent it
p288
aVand nothing to stop it.
p289
aVThe issue shouldn't be stopping refugees from coming into our countries.
p290
aVThe issue should be not forcing them to leave their own.
p291
aa(lp292
V(Applause)
p293
aa(lp294
VSorry.
p295
aa(lp296
V(Applause)
p297
aa(lp298
VHow much more suffering,
p299
aVhow much more suffering must we take?
p300
aVHow many more people need to be forced out of their homes
p301
aVbefore we say, "Enough!"?
p302
aVA hundred million?
p303
aVNot only do we shame, blame and reject them
p304
aVfor atrocities that they had absolutely nothing to do with,
p305
aVwe re-traumatize them,
p306
aVwhen we're supposed to be welcoming them into our countries.
p307
aVWe strip them of their dignity and treat them like criminals.
p308
aa(lp309
VI had a student in my office a couple of weeks ago.
p310
aVShe's originally from Iraq.
p311
aVShe broke down crying.
p312
aa(lp313
V"Why do they hate us?"
p314
aa(lp315
V"Who hates you?"
p316
aa(lp317
V"Everyone; everyone hates us because we are refugees,
p318
aVbecause we are Muslim."
p319
aa(lp320
VIn the past, I was able to reassure my students
p321
aVthat the majority of the world does not hate refugees.
p322
aVBut this time I couldn't.
p323
aVI couldn't explain to her why someone tried to rip off her mother's hijab
p324
aVwhen they were grocery shopping,
p325
aVor why a player on an opposing team called her a terrorist
p326
aVand told her to go back where she came from.
p327
aVI couldn't reassure her
p328
aVthat her father's ultimate life sacrifice
p329
aVby serving in the United States military as an interpreter
p330
aVwould make her more valued as an American citizen.
p331
aa(lp332
VWe take in so few refugees worldwide.
p333
aVWe resettle less than 0.1 percent.
p334
aVThat 0.1 percent benefits us more than them.
p335
aVIt dumbfounds me how the word "refugee" is considered something to be dirty,
p336
aVsomething to be ashamed of.
p337
aVThey have nothing to be ashamed of.
p338
aa(lp339
VWe have seen advances in every aspect of our lives \u2014
p340
aVexcept our humanity.
p341
aVThere are 65.3 million people who have been forced out of their homes
p342
aVbecause of war \u2014
p343
aVthe largest number in history.
p344
aVWe are the ones who should be ashamed.
p345
aa(lp346
VThank you.
