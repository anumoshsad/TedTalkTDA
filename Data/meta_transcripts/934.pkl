VThis talk is about righting writing wrongs.
p4
aVNo, the sound's not faulty \u2014 righting writing wrongs.
p5
aVThe Middle East is huge,
p6
aVand with all our problems, one thing's for sure: we love to laugh.
p7
aVI think humor is a great way to celebrate our differences.
p8
aVWe need to take our responsibilities seriously,
p9
aVbut not ourselves.
p10
aVDon't get me wrong: it's not like we don't have comedy in the Middle East.
p11
aVI grew up at a time when iconic actors
p12
aVfrom Kuwait, Syria, Egypt
p13
aVused laughter to unite the region,
p14
aVjust as football can.
p15
aV(Laughter)
p16
aVNow is the time for us to laugh at ourselves,
p17
aVbefore others can laugh with us.
p18
aVThis is the story of the rise and rise of stand-up comedy in the Middle East \u2014
p19
aVa stand-up uprising, if you will.
p20
aa(lp21
VWorking in London as TV maker and writer,
p22
aVI quickly realized
p23
aVthat comedy connects audiences.
p24
aVNow, the best breeding ground for good comic writing
p25
aVis the stand-up comedy circuit,
p26
aVwhere they just happen to say that you kill when you do well
p27
aVand you bomb when you do badly.
p28
aVAn unfortunate connection for us maybe,
p29
aVbut it reminds me
p30
aVthat we'd like to thank one man for, over the past decade,
p31
aVworking tirelessly
p32
aVto support comedians all around the world,
p33
aVspecifically comedians
p34
aVwith a Middle Eastern background.
p35
aV(Applause)
p36
aVLike my good friends, Dean and Maysoon, at the bottom of the screen,
p37
aVwho, two years after 9/11,
p38
aVstarted a festival to change the way
p39
aVMiddle Easterners are perceived in the world.
p40
aVIt's still going strong, with positive press to die for.
p41
aVAlso, three guys working for years in Los Angeles,
p42
aVan Iranian, a Palestinian and an Egyptian,
p43
aVcreated the aptly named Axis of Evil comedy act.
p44
aVAnd wherever they went,
p45
aVthey killed.
p46
aa(lp47
VNow, I didn't start this fire, but I did pour petrol on it.
p48
aVI moved to Dubai as the head of original content
p49
aVfor a Western TV network.
p50
aVMy job was to connect the brand with a Middle Eastern audience.
p51
aVNow, the American head of programming
p52
aVwanted new local Arabic comedy.
p53
aVIn a thick Arabic accent, my brain went,
p54
aV"Berfect."
p55
aV(Laughter)
p56
aVNow, I had friends in the U.S.
p57
aVwho had started a successful new tribe.
p58
aVAnd I had every intention of taking this tribe
p59
aVfrom being outliers in the Middle East
p60
aVand pushing them over the tipping point
p61
aVtowards success.
p62
aVNow, as with any new idea, it wasn't easy.
p63
aVI had four phases to this plan.
p64
aVFirst, we'd need to buy content from the West and air it.
p65
aVThen I'd bring my friends, and we'd show local amateurs how it's done.
p66
aVWe would film that and air it,
p67
aVand then I could work with the local amateurs and write new comedy.
p68
aa(lp69
VI excitedly presented this to the big boss,
p70
aVand his reaction was, "Um, I don't get it."
p71
aVSo I retreated back to my cave
p72
aVand continued to support and produce comedy
p73
aVand let my friends use my couch
p74
aVas a regional operations hub.
p75
aVNow, fast forward two years, to early 2007.
p76
aVThe earth rotated, as did our management,
p77
aV(Laughter)
p78
aVand as if by divine intervention,
p79
aVthings came together
p80
aVto help this revolution take shape.
p81
aVHere's how the dots connected.
p82
aVFirst, the Axis guys recorded a Comedy Central special
p83
aVthat aired in the States,
p84
aVand it was getting great hits on YouTube.
p85
aVOur new French CEO
p86
aVbelieved in the power of positive PR ...
p87
aV(Laughter)
p88
aVand ideas du bon marche.
p89
aVLet's just say "value for money."
p90
aVI produced in Dubai a show for Ahmed Ahmed
p91
aVto showcase his new Axis special to a packed room.
p92
aVI invited our new CEO,
p93
aVand as soon as he realized we had a room packed full of laughing infidels,
p94
aVhis reaction was very simple:
p95
aV"Let's make this happen.
p96
aVAnd one more thing: No, don't F it up."
p97
aVSo I quickly went to work
p98
aVwith a great team around me.
p99
aVI happened to find
p100
aVa funny guy to present it in Arabic,
p101
aVwho is originally Korean,
p102
aVa perfect fit for the Axis of Evil.
p103
aVThis is all true.
p104
aa(lp105
VNow, while preparing for the tour,
p106
aVI had to remind the guys to be culturally sensitive.
p107
aVI used the three Bs of stand-up don'ts
p108
aVas I call them in the Middle East:
p109
aVblue content, keep it clean; beliefs, not religion;
p110
aVand the third B, bolitics.
p111
aVStay away from bolitics in the Middle East.
p112
aVOh course, you might think, what's left
p113
aVwithout bolitics, sex and religion, how can you make people laugh?
p114
aVI'd say, watch any successful well-written,
p115
aVfamily-friendly sitcom in the West
p116
aVfor your answers.
p117
aa(lp118
VNow, were the Axis successful?
p119
aVIn five countries, in just under a month,
p120
aVwe had thousands of fanatical fans come and see them live.
p121
aVWe had millions see them on TV and on TV news.
p122
aVIn Jordan, we had His Majesty the King come and see them.
p123
aVIn fact, they were so successful
p124
aVthat you could buy a pirated copy of their DVD,
p125
aVeven before it was released in the Middle East.
p126
aVAnywhere you go.
p127
aVSo everywhere we went,
p128
aVwe auditioned amateurs.
p129
aVWe filmed that process and aired a documentary.
p130
aVI called it "Three Guys and Wonho."
p131
aVIt really is his name.
p132
aVAnd all this TV and Internet exposure
p133
aVhas led to a great many
p134
aVrecruits to our cause.
p135
aVIn Dubai this year, we've just had
p136
aVthe first all-women's, homegrown stand-up show.
p137
aVAnd notice two of them are wearing headscarves,
p138
aVand yes, even they can laugh.
p139
aa(lp140
VDubai, to me, is like a hand
p141
aVthat supports anyone who wants to make things happen.
p142
aV20 years ago,
p143
aVno one had heard of it.
p144
aVLook at it now.
p145
aVWith an inspirational leader, I think this year,
p146
aVthe opening of the tallest tower in the world
p147
aVis like adding a finger to that hand,
p148
aVthat points at all those
p149
aVwho spread fallacious stories about us.
p150
aa(lp151
V(Laughter)
p152
aa(lp153
V(Applause)
p154
aa(lp155
VNow, in three short years, we've come a long way
p156
aVwith stand-up comedy shows happening even in Saudi Arabia.
p157
aVThese comics are now going to the New York festival.
p158
aVAnd the Lebanese, brilliant Lebanese,
p159
aVNemr Abou Nassar, we featured in our first tour,
p160
aVhas just been performing in L.A.'s legendary comedy clubs.
p161
aVSo clearly, from the inside, we are doing our best to change our image,
p162
aVand it's exploding.
p163
aV(Laughter)
p164
aVSo, as for the outsiders looking in,
p165
aVwatch the CNN report on the second Amman Comedy Festival.
p166
aVThe reporter did a great job, and I thank her,
p167
aVbut somebody forgot to send the positive PR email
p168
aVto the person operating the automatic news ticker that appears at the bottom.
p169
aVFor example, when Dean talks,
p170
aVthe ticker says, "U.S.: Suspect gave 'actionable intel."
p171
aVWell, if you're used to listening to comedians,
p172
aVthen I'm not surprised.
p173
aa(lp174
VSadly, this leads me to another three Bs
p175
aVthat represents how the media in the West
p176
aVtalks about us as bombers, billionaires
p177
aVand belly dancers.
p178
aVEnough.
p179
aVWe're not all angry fanatics
p180
aVwho want to kill the infidel.
p181
aVWe have a positive story to tell
p182
aVand image to sell.
p183
aVIn fact, one thing's for sure, in my experience,
p184
aVwe love to laugh like hell.
p185
aa(lp186
V(Laughter)
p187
aa(lp188
VHere are three questions that I like to use
p189
aVto test the truthiness of our representation
p190
aVin any media story.
p191
aVOne: Is the Middle East
p192
aVbeing shown in a current time
p193
aVand correct context?
p194
aV(Laughter)
p195
aVTwo: Do the Middle Eastern characters
p196
aVlaugh or smile
p197
aVwithout showing the whites of their eyes?
p198
aV(Laughter)
p199
aVThree: Is the Middle Eastern character
p200
aVbeing played by one?
p201
aVClearly, there are wrongs that need to be righted.
p202
aVWe've started in our region.
p203
aVMy challenge to the rest of the world
p204
aVis please, start using
p205
aVpositive Middle Eastern images in your stories.
p206
aVFor inspiration, go to one of our festivals,
p207
aVgo online, drop us a line.
p208
aVLet's change the narrative together
p209
aVand let's start righting writing wrongs.
p210
aa(lp211
VI'd like to end, before going back to the Middle East,
p212
aVwith a quote from one of the greatest Sheikhs
p213
aVto put quill to parchment.
p214
aVAs my father likes to call him, "Asheikh Azubare;"
p215
aVas my mother would say, "Shakespeare."
p216
aV(Laughter)
p217
aV"And now we go in content
p218
aVto liberty and not to banishment."
p219
aa(lp220
VThank you.
