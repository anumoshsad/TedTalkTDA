VSo, here we go: a flyby of play.
p4
aa(lp5
VIt's got to be serious if the New York Times
p6
aVputs a cover story of their February 17th Sunday magazine about play.
p7
aVAt the bottom of this, it says, "It's deeper than gender.
p8
aVSeriously, but dangerously fun.
p9
aVAnd a sandbox for new ideas about evolution."
p10
aVNot bad, except if you look at that cover, what's missing?
p11
aVYou see any adults?
p12
aa(lp13
VWell, lets go back to the 15th century.
p14
aVThis is a courtyard in Europe,
p15
aVand a mixture of 124 different kinds of play.
p16
aVAll ages, solo play, body play, games, taunting.
p17
aVAnd there it is. And I think this is a typical picture
p18
aVof what it was like in a courtyard then.
p19
aVI think we may have lost something in our culture.
p20
aa(lp21
VSo I'm gonna take you through
p22
aVwhat I think is a remarkable sequence.
p23
aVNorth of Churchill, Manitoba, in October and November,
p24
aVthere's no ice on Hudson Bay.
p25
aVAnd this polar bear that you see, this 1200-pound male,
p26
aVhe's wild and fairly hungry.
p27
aVAnd Norbert Rosing, a German photographer,
p28
aVis there on scene, making a series of photos of these huskies, who are tethered.
p29
aVAnd from out of stage left comes this wild, male polar bear,
p30
aVwith a predatory gaze.
p31
aVAny of you who've been to Africa or had a junkyard dog come after you,
p32
aVthere is a fixed kind of predatory gaze
p33
aVthat you know you're in trouble.
p34
aVBut on the other side of that predatory gaze
p35
aVis a female husky in a play bow, wagging her tail.
p36
aVAnd something very unusual happens.
p37
aVThat fixed behavior \u2014 which is rigid and stereotyped
p38
aVand ends up with a meal \u2014 changes.
p39
aVAnd this polar bear
p40
aVstands over the husky,
p41
aVno claws extended, no fangs taking a look.
p42
aVAnd they begin an incredible ballet.
p43
aa(lp44
VA play ballet.
p45
aVThis is in nature: it overrides a carnivorous nature
p46
aVand what otherwise would have been a short fight to the death.
p47
aVAnd if you'll begin to look closely at the husky that's bearing her throat to the polar bear,
p48
aVand look a little more closely, they're in an altered state.
p49
aVThey're in a state of play.
p50
aVAnd it's that state
p51
aVthat allows these two creatures to explore the possible.
p52
aVThey are beginning to do something that neither would have done
p53
aVwithout the play signals.
p54
aVAnd it is a marvelous example
p55
aVof how a differential in power
p56
aVcan be overridden by a process of nature that's within all of us.
p57
aa(lp58
VNow how did I get involved in this?
p59
aVJohn mentioned that I've done some work with murderers, and I have.
p60
aVThe Texas Tower murderer opened my eyes,
p61
aVin retrospect, when we studied his tragic mass murder,
p62
aVto the importance of play,
p63
aVin that that individual, by deep study,
p64
aVwas found to have severe play deprivation.
p65
aVCharles Whitman was his name.
p66
aVAnd our committee, which consisted of a lot of hard scientists,
p67
aVdid feel at the end of that study
p68
aVthat the absence of play and a progressive suppression of developmentally normal play
p69
aVled him to be more vulnerable to the tragedy that he perpetrated.
p70
aVAnd that finding has stood the test of time \u2014
p71
aVunfortunately even into more recent times, at Virginia Tech.
p72
aa(lp73
VAnd other studies of populations at risk
p74
aVsensitized me to the importance of play,
p75
aVbut I didn't really understand what it was.
p76
aVAnd it was many years in taking play histories of individuals
p77
aVbefore I really began to recognize that I didn't really have a full understanding of it.
p78
aVAnd I don't think any of us has a full understanding of it, by any means.
p79
aVBut there are ways of looking at it
p80
aVthat I think can give you \u2014 give us all a taxonomy, a way of thinking about it.
p81
aa(lp82
VAnd this image is, for humans, the beginning point of play.
p83
aVWhen that mother and infant lock eyes,
p84
aVand the infant's old enough to have a social smile,
p85
aVwhat happens \u2014 spontaneously \u2014 is the eruption of joy on the part of the mother.
p86
aVAnd she begins to babble and coo and smile, and so does the baby.
p87
aVIf we've got them wired up with an electroencephalogram,
p88
aVthe right brain of each of them becomes attuned,
p89
aVso that the joyful emergence of this earliest of play scenes
p90
aVand the physiology of that is something we're beginning to get a handle on.
p91
aa(lp92
VAnd I'd like you to think that every bit of more complex play
p93
aVbuilds on this base for us humans.
p94
aVAnd so now I'm going to take you through sort of a way of looking at play,
p95
aVbut it's never just singularly one thing.
p96
aa(lp97
VWe're going to look at body play,
p98
aVwhich is a spontaneous desire to get ourselves out of gravity.
p99
aVThis is a mountain goat.
p100
aVIf you're having a bad day, try this:
p101
aVjump up and down, wiggle around \u2014 you're going to feel better.
p102
aVAnd you may feel like this character,
p103
aVwho is also just doing it for its own sake.
p104
aVIt doesn't have a particular purpose, and that's what's great about play.
p105
aVIf its purpose is more important
p106
aVthan the act of doing it, it's probably not play.
p107
aa(lp108
VAnd there's a whole other type of play, which is object play.
p109
aVAnd this Japanese macaque has made a snowball,
p110
aVand he or she's going to roll down a hill.
p111
aVAnd \u2014 they don't throw it at each other, but this is a fundamental part of being playful.
p112
aVThe human hand, in manipulation of objects,
p113
aVis the hand in search of a brain;
p114
aVthe brain is in search of a hand;
p115
aVand play is the medium by which those two are linked in the best way.
p116
aa(lp117
VJPL we heard this morning \u2014 JPL is an incredible place.
p118
aVThey have located two consultants,
p119
aVFrank Wilson and Nate Johnson,
p120
aVwho are \u2014 Frank Wilson is a neurologist, Nate Johnson is a mechanic.
p121
aVHe taught mechanics in a high school in Long Beach,
p122
aVand found that his students were no longer able to solve problems.
p123
aVAnd he tried to figure out why. And he came to the conclusion, quite on his own,
p124
aVthat the students who could no longer solve problems, such as fixing cars,
p125
aVhadn't worked with their hands.
p126
aVFrank Wilson had written a book called "The Hand."
p127
aVThey got together \u2014 JPL hired them.
p128
aVNow JPL, NASA and Boeing,
p129
aVbefore they will hire a research and development problem solver \u2014
p130
aVeven if they're summa cum laude from Harvard or Cal Tech \u2014
p131
aVif they haven't fixed cars, haven't done stuff with their hands early in life,
p132
aVplayed with their hands, they can't problem-solve as well.
p133
aVSo play is practical, and it's very important.
p134
aa(lp135
VNow one of the things about play is that it is born by curiosity and exploration. (Laughter)
p136
aVBut it has to be safe exploration.
p137
aVThis happens to be OK \u2014 he's an anatomically interested little boy
p138
aVand that's his mom. Other situations wouldn't be quite so good.
p139
aVBut curiosity, exploration, are part of the play scene.
p140
aVIf you want to belong, you need social play.
p141
aVAnd social play is part of what we're about here today,
p142
aVand is a byproduct of the play scene.
p143
aa(lp144
VRough and tumble play.
p145
aVThese lionesses, seen from a distance, looked like they were fighting.
p146
aVBut if you look closely, they're kind of like the polar bear and husky:
p147
aVno claws, flat fur, soft eyes,
p148
aVopen mouth with no fangs, balletic movements,
p149
aVcurvilinear movements \u2014 all specific to play.
p150
aVAnd rough-and-tumble play is a great learning medium for all of us.
p151
aVPreschool kids, for example, should be allowed to dive, hit, whistle,
p152
aVscream, be chaotic, and develop through that a lot of emotional regulation
p153
aVand a lot of the other social byproducts \u2014 cognitive, emotional and physical \u2014
p154
aVthat come as a part of rough and tumble play.
p155
aa(lp156
VSpectator play, ritual play \u2014 we're involved in some of that.
p157
aVThose of you who are from Boston know that this was the moment \u2014 rare \u2014
p158
aVwhere the Red Sox won the World Series.
p159
aVBut take a look at the face and the body language of everybody
p160
aVin this fuzzy picture, and you can get a sense that they're all at play.
p161
aa(lp162
VImaginative play.
p163
aVI love this picture because my daughter, who's now almost 40, is in this picture,
p164
aVbut it reminds me of her storytelling and her imagination,
p165
aVher ability to spin yarns at this age \u2014 preschool.
p166
aVA really important part of being a player
p167
aVis imaginative solo play.
p168
aa(lp169
VAnd I love this one, because it's also what we're about.
p170
aVWe all have an internal narrative that's our own inner story.
p171
aVThe unit of intelligibility of most of our brains is the story.
p172
aVI'm telling you a story today about play.
p173
aVWell, this bushman, I think, is talking about the fish that got away that was that long,
p174
aVbut it's a fundamental part of the play scene.
p175
aa(lp176
VSo what does play do for the brain?
p177
aVWell, a lot.
p178
aa(lp179
VWe don't know a whole lot about what it does for the human brain,
p180
aVbecause funding has not been exactly heavy for research on play.
p181
aVI walked into the Carnegie asking for a grant.
p182
aVThey'd given me a large grant when I was an academician
p183
aVfor the study of felony drunken drivers, and I thought I had a pretty good track record,
p184
aVand by the time I had spent half an hour talking about play,
p185
aVit was obvious that they were not \u2014 did not feel that play was serious.
p186
aVI think that \u2014 that's a few years back \u2014 I think that wave is past,
p187
aVand the play wave is cresting,
p188
aVbecause there is some good science.
p189
aa(lp190
VNothing lights up the brain like play.
p191
aVThree-dimensional play fires up the cerebellum,
p192
aVputs a lot of impulses into the frontal lobe \u2014
p193
aVthe executive portion \u2014 helps contextual memory be developed,
p194
aVand \u2014 and, and, and.
p195
aa(lp196
VSo it's \u2014 for me, its been an extremely nourishing scholarly adventure
p197
aVto look at the neuroscience that's associated with play, and to bring together people
p198
aVwho in their individual disciplines hadn't really thought of it that way.
p199
aVAnd that's part of what the National Institute for Play is all about.
p200
aVAnd this is one of the ways you can study play \u2014
p201
aVis to get a 256-lead electroencephalogram.
p202
aVI'm sorry I don't have a playful-looking subject, but it allows mobility,
p203
aVwhich has limited the actual study of play.
p204
aVAnd we've got a mother-infant play scenario
p205
aVthat we're hoping to complete underway at the moment.
p206
aa(lp207
VThe reason I put this here is also to queue up
p208
aVmy thoughts about objectifying what play does.
p209
aVThe animal world has objectified it.
p210
aVIn the animal world, if you take rats,
p211
aVwho are hardwired to play at a certain period of their juvenile years
p212
aVand you suppress play \u2014 they squeak, they wrestle,
p213
aVthey pin each other, that's part of their play.
p214
aVIf you stop that behavior on one group that you're experimenting with,
p215
aVand you allow it in another group that you're experimenting with,
p216
aVand then you present those rats
p217
aVwith a cat odor-saturated collar,
p218
aVthey're hardwired to flee and hide.
p219
aVPretty smart \u2014 they don't want to get killed by a cat.
p220
aVSo what happens?
p221
aVThey both hide out.
p222
aVThe non-players never come out \u2014
p223
aVthey die.
p224
aVThe players slowly explore the environment,
p225
aVand begin again to test things out.
p226
aVThat says to me, at least in rats \u2014
p227
aVand I think they have the same neurotransmitters that we do
p228
aVand a similar cortical architecture \u2014
p229
aVthat play may be pretty important for our survival.
p230
aa(lp231
VAnd, and, and \u2014 there are a lot more animal studies that I could talk about.
p232
aa(lp233
VNow, this is a consequence of play deprivation. (Laughter)
p234
aVThis took a long time \u2014
p235
aVI had to get Homer down and put him through the fMRI and the SPECT
p236
aVand multiple EEGs, but as a couch potato, his brain has shrunk.
p237
aVAnd we do know that in domestic animals
p238
aVand others, when they're play deprived,
p239
aVthey don't \u2014 and rats also \u2014 they don't develop a brain that is normal.
p240
aa(lp241
VNow, the program says that the opposite of play is not work,
p242
aVit's depression.
p243
aVAnd I think if you think about life without play \u2014
p244
aVno humor, no flirtation, no movies,
p245
aVno games, no fantasy and, and, and.
p246
aVTry and imagine a culture or a life, adult or otherwise
p247
aVwithout play.
p248
aVAnd the thing that's so unique about our species
p249
aVis that we're really designed to play through our whole lifetime.
p250
aa(lp251
VAnd we all have capacity to play signal.
p252
aVNobody misses that dog I took a picture of on a Carmel beach a couple of weeks ago.
p253
aVWhat's going to follow from that behavior
p254
aVis play.
p255
aVAnd you can trust it.
p256
aVThe basis of human trust is established through play signals.
p257
aVAnd we begin to lose those signals, culturally and otherwise, as adults.
p258
aVThat's a shame.
p259
aVI think we've got a lot of learning to do.
p260
aa(lp261
VNow, Jane Goodall has here a play face along with one of her favorite chimps.
p262
aVSo part of the signaling system of play
p263
aVhas to do with vocal, facial, body, gestural.
p264
aVYou know, you can tell \u2014 and I think when we're getting into collective play,
p265
aVits really important for groups to gain a sense of safety
p266
aVthrough their own sharing of play signals.
p267
aa(lp268
VYou may not know this word,
p269
aVbut it should be your biological first name and last name.
p270
aVBecause neoteny means the retention of immature qualities into adulthood.
p271
aVAnd we are, by physical anthropologists,
p272
aVby many, many studies, the most neotenous,
p273
aVthe most youthful, the most flexible, the most plastic of all creatures.
p274
aVAnd therefore, the most playful.
p275
aVAnd this gives us a leg up on adaptability.
p276
aa(lp277
VNow, there is a way of looking at play
p278
aVthat I also want to emphasize here,
p279
aVwhich is the play history.
p280
aVYour own personal play history is unique,
p281
aVand often is not something we think about particularly.
p282
aa(lp283
VThis is a book written by a consummate player
p284
aVby the name of Kevin Carroll.
p285
aVKevin Carroll came from extremely deprived circumstances:
p286
aValcoholic mother, absent father, inner-city Philadelphia,
p287
aVblack, had to take care of a younger brother.
p288
aVFound that when he looked at a playground
p289
aVout of a window into which he had been confined,
p290
aVhe felt something different.
p291
aVAnd so he followed up on it.
p292
aVAnd his life \u2014 the transformation of his life
p293
aVfrom deprivation and what one would expect \u2014 potentially prison or death \u2014
p294
aVhe become a linguist, a trainer for the 76ers and now is a motivational speaker.
p295
aVAnd he gives play as a transformative force
p296
aVover his entire life.
p297
aa(lp298
VNow there's another play history that I think is a work in progress.
p299
aVThose of you who remember Al Gore,
p300
aVduring the first term and then during his successful
p301
aVbut unelected run for the presidency,
p302
aVmay remember him as being kind of wooden and not entirely his own person,
p303
aVat least in public.
p304
aVAnd looking at his history, which is common in the press,
p305
aVit seems to me, at least \u2014 looking at it from a shrink's point of view \u2014
p306
aVthat a lot of his life was programmed.
p307
aVSummers were hard, hard work, in the heat of Tennessee summers.
p308
aVHe had the expectations of his senatorial father and Washington, D.C.
p309
aVAnd although I think he certainly had the capacity for play \u2014
p310
aVbecause I do know something about that \u2014
p311
aVhe wasn't as empowered, I think, as he now is
p312
aVby paying attention to what is his own passion
p313
aVand his own inner drive,
p314
aVwhich I think has its basis in all of us in our play history.
p315
aa(lp316
VSo what I would encourage on an individual level to do,
p317
aVis to explore backwards as far as you can go
p318
aVto the most clear, joyful, playful image that you have,
p319
aVwhether it's with a toy, on a birthday or on a vacation.
p320
aVAnd begin to build to build from the emotion of that
p321
aVinto how that connects with your life now.
p322
aVAnd you'll find, you may change jobs \u2014
p323
aVwhich has happened to a number people when I've had them do this \u2014
p324
aVin order to be more empowered through their play.
p325
aVOr you'll be able to enrich your life by prioritizing it
p326
aVand paying attention to it.
p327
aa(lp328
VMost of us work with groups, and I put this up because
p329
aVthe d.school, the design school at Stanford,
p330
aVthanks to David Kelley and a lot of others
p331
aVwho have been visionary about its establishment,
p332
aVhas allowed a group of us to get together
p333
aVand create a course called "From Play to Innovation."
p334
aVAnd you'll see this course is to investigate
p335
aVthe human state of play, which is kind of like the polar bear-husky state
p336
aVand its importance to creative thinking:
p337
aV"to explore play behavior, its development and its biological basis;
p338
aVto apply those principles, through design thinking,
p339
aVto promote innovation in the corporate world;
p340
aVand the students will work with real-world partners
p341
aVon design projects with widespread application."
p342
aa(lp343
VThis is our maiden voyage in this.
p344
aVWe're about two and a half, three months into it, and it's really been fun.
p345
aVThere is our star pupil, this labrador,
p346
aVwho taught a lot of us what a state of play is,
p347
aVand an extremely aged and decrepit professor in charge there.
p348
aVAnd Brendan Boyle, Rich Crandall \u2014 and on the far right is, I think, a person who
p349
aVwill be in cahoots with George Smoot for a Nobel Prize \u2014 Stuart Thompson,
p350
aVin neuroscience.
p351
aVSo we've had Brendan, who's from IDEO,
p352
aVand the rest of us sitting aside and watching these students
p353
aVas they put play principles into practice in the classroom.
p354
aVAnd one of their projects was to
p355
aVsee what makes meetings boring,
p356
aVand to try and do something about it.
p357
aVSo what will follow is a student-made film
p358
aVabout just that.
p359
aa(lp360
VNarrator: Flow is the mental state of apparition
p361
aVin which the person is fully immersed in what he or she is doing.
p362
aVCharacterized by a feeling of energized focus,
p363
aVfull involvement and success in the process of the activity.
p364
aa(lp365
VAn important key insight that we learned about meetings
p366
aVis that people pack them in one after another,
p367
aVdisruptive to the day.
p368
aVAttendees at meetings don't know when they'll get back to the task
p369
aVthat they left at their desk.
p370
aVBut it doesn't have to be that way.
p371
aa(lp372
V(Music)
p373
aa(lp374
VSome sage and repeatedly furry monks
p375
aVat this place called the d.school
p376
aVdesigned a meeting that you can literally step out of when it's over.
p377
aVTake the meeting off, and have peace of mind that you can come back to me.
p378
aVBecause when you need it again,
p379
aVthe meeting is literally hanging in your closet.
p380
aa(lp381
VThe Wearable Meeting.
p382
aVBecause when you put it on, you immediately get everything you need
p383
aVto have a fun and productive and useful meeting.
p384
aVBut when you take it off \u2014
p385
aVthat's when the real action happens.
p386
aa(lp387
V(Music)
p388
aa(lp389
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p390
aa(lp391
VStuart Brown: So I would encourage you all
p392
aVto engage
p393
aVnot in the work-play differential \u2014
p394
aVwhere you set aside time to play \u2014
p395
aVbut where your life becomes infused
p396
aVminute by minute, hour by hour,
p397
aVwith body,
p398
aVobject,
p399
aVsocial, fantasy, transformational kinds of play.
p400
aVAnd I think you'll have a better and more empowered life.
p401
aVThank You.
p402
aa(lp403
V(Applause)
p404
aa(lp405
VJohn Hockenberry: So it sounds to me like what you're saying is that
p406
aVthere may be some temptation on the part of people to look at your work
p407
aVand go \u2014
p408
aVI think I've heard this, in my kind of pop psychological understanding of play,
p409
aVthat somehow,
p410
aVthe way animals and humans deal with play,
p411
aVis that it's some sort of rehearsal for adult activity.
p412
aVYour work seems to suggest that that is powerfully wrong.

VSB: Yeah, I don't think that's accurate,
p415
aVand I think probably because animals have taught us that.
p416
aVIf you stop a cat from playing \u2014
p417
aVwhich you can do, and we've all seen how cats bat around stuff \u2014
p418
aVthey're just as good predators as they would be if they hadn't played.
p419
aVAnd if you imagine a kid
p420
aVpretending to be King Kong,
p421
aVor a race car driver, or a fireman,
p422
aVthey don't all become race car drivers or firemen, you know.
p423
aVSo there's a disconnect between preparation for the future \u2014
p424
aVwhich is what most people are comfortable in thinking about play as \u2014
p425
aVand thinking of it as a separate biological entity.
p426
aa(lp427
VAnd this is where my chasing animals for four, five years
p428
aVreally changed my perspective from a clinician to what I am now,
p429
aVwhich is that play has a biological place,
p430
aVjust like sleep and dreams do.
p431
aVAnd if you look at sleep and dreams biologically,
p432
aVanimals sleep and dream,
p433
aVand they rehearse and they do some other things that help memory
p434
aVand that are a very important part of sleep and dreams.
p435
aa(lp436
VThe next step of evolution in mammals and
p437
aVcreatures with divinely superfluous neurons
p438
aVwill be to play.
p439
aVAnd the fact that the polar bear and husky or magpie and a bear
p440
aVor you and I and our dogs can crossover and have that experience
p441
aVsets play aside as something separate.
p442
aVAnd its hugely important in learning and crafting the brain.
p443
aVSo it's not just something you do in your spare time.

VJH: How do you keep \u2014 and I know you're part of the scientific research community,
p446
aVand you have to justify your existence with grants and proposals like everyone else \u2014
p447
aVhow do you prevent \u2014
p448
aVand some of the data that you've produced, the good science that you're talking about you've produced, is hot to handle.
p449
aVHow do you prevent either the media's interpretation of your work
p450
aVor the scientific community's interpretation of the implications of your work,
p451
aVkind of like the Mozart metaphor,
p452
aVwhere, "Oh, MRIs show
p453
aVthat play enhances your intelligence.
p454
aVWell, let's round these kids up, put them in pens
p455
aVand make them play for months at a time; they'll all be geniuses and go to Harvard."
p456
aVHow do you prevent people from taking that sort of action
p457
aVon the data that you're developing?
p458
aa(lp459
VSB: Well, I think the only way I know to do it
p460
aVis to have accumulated the advisers that I have
p461
aVwho go from practitioners \u2014
p462
aVwho can establish through improvisational play or clowning or whatever \u2014
p463
aVa state of play.
p464
aVSo people know that it's there.
p465
aVAnd then you get an fMRI specialist, and you get Frank Wilson,
p466
aVand you get other kinds of hard scientists, including neuroendocrinologists.
p467
aVAnd you get them into a group together focused on play,
p468
aVand it's pretty hard not to take it seriously.
p469
aa(lp470
VUnfortunately, that hasn't been done sufficiently
p471
aVfor the National Science Foundation, National Institute of Mental Health
p472
aVor anybody else to really look at it in this way seriously.
p473
aVI mean you don't hear about anything that's like cancer or heart disease
p474
aVassociated with play.
p475
aVAnd yet I see it as something that's just as basic for survival \u2014 long term \u2014
p476
aVas learning some of the basic things about public health.
