p7
aVfour miles off the coast of Key Largo,
p8
aVabout 60 feet below the surface.
p9
aVNASA uses this extreme environment
p10
aVto train astronauts and aquanauts,
p11
aVand last year, they invited us along for the ride.
p12
aVAll the footage was taken from our open ROV,
p13
aVwhich is a robot that we built in our garage.
p14
aa(lp15
VSo ROV stands for Remote Operated Vehicle,
p16
aVwhich in our case means our little robot
p17
aVsends live video

aVacross that ultra-thin tether
p19
aVback to the computer topside.
p20
aVIt's open source, meaning we publish
p21
aVand share all of our design files
p22
aVand all of our code online,
p23
aVallowing anyone to modify
p24
aVor improve or change the design.
p25
aVIt's built with mostly off-the-shelf parts
p26
aVand costs about 1,000 times cheaper
p27
aVthan the ROVs James Cameron used
p28
aVto explore the Titanic.
p29
aVSo ROVs aren't new.
p30
aVThey've been around for decades.
p31
aVScientists use ROVs to explore the oceans.
p32
aVOil and gas companies use them for exploration
p33
aVand construction.
p34
aVWhat we've built isn't unique.
p35
aVIt's how we've built it that's really unique.
p36
aa(lp37
VSo I want to give you a quick story of how it got started.
p38
aVSo a few years ago, my friend Eric and I
p39
aVdecided we wanted to explore this underwater cave
p40
aVin the foothills of the Sierras.
p41
aVWe had heard this story about lost gold
p42
aVfrom a Gold Rush-era robbery, and we wanted to go up there.
p43
aVUnfortunately, we didn't have any money
p44
aVand we didn't have any tools to do it.
p45
aVSo Eric had an initial design idea for a robot,
p46
aVbut we didn't have all the parts figured out,
p47
aVso we did what anybody would do in our situation:
p48
aVwe asked the Internet for help.
p49
aVMore specifically, we created this website,
p50
aVopenROV.com, and shared  our intentions and our plans
p51
aVFor the first few months, it was just Eric and I
p52
aVtalking back to each other on the forums,
p53
aVbut pretty soon, we started to get feedback
p54
aVfrom makers and hobbyists,
p55
aVand then actually professional ocean engineers
p56
aVwho had some suggestions for what we should do.
p57
aVWe kept working on it. We learned a lot.
p58
aVWe kept prototyping, and eventually,
p59
aVwe decided we wanted to go  to the cave. We were ready.
p60
aa(lp61
VSo about that time, our little expedition became quite a story,
p62
aVand it got picked up in The New York Times.
p63
aVAnd we were pretty much just overwhelmed
p64
aVwith interest from people who wanted a kit
p65
aVthat they could build this open ROV themselves.
p66
aa(lp67
VSo we decided to put the project on Kickstarter,
p68
aVand when we did,
p69
aVwe raised our funding goal in about two hours,
p70
aVand all of a sudden,  had this money to make these kits.
p71
aVBut then we had to learn how to make them.
p72
aVI mean, we had to learn small batch manufacturing.
p73
aVSo we quickly learned that our garage
p74
aVwas not big enough to hold our growing operation.
p75
aVBut we were able to do it, we got all the kits made,
p76
aVthanks a lot to TechShop, which was a big help to us,
p77
aVand we shipped these kits all over the world
p78
aVjust before Christmas of last year,
p79
aVso it was just a few months ago.
p80
aVBut we're already starting to get video
p81
aVand photos back from all over the world,
p82
aVincluding this shot from under the ice in Antarctica.
p83
aVWe've also learned the penguins love robots.
p84
aV(Laughter)
p85
aa(lp86
VSo we're still publishing all the designs online,
p87
aVencouraging anyone to build these themselves.
p88
aVThat's the only way that we could have done this.
p89
aVBy being open source, we've created
p90
aVthis distributed R&D network,
p91
aVand we're moving faster than any venture-backed counterpart.
p92
aVBut the actual robot is really only half the story.
p93
aVThe real potential, the long term potential,
p94
aVis with this community of DIY ocean explorers
p95
aVthat are forming all over the globe.
p96
aVWhat can we discover
p97
aVwhen there's thousands of these devices
p98
aVroaming the seas?
p99
aa(lp100
VSo you're probably all wondering: the cave.
p101
aVDid you find the gold?
p102
aVWell, we didn't find any gold,
p103
aVbut we decided that what we found was much more valuable.
p104
aVIt was the glimpse into a potential future
p105
aVfor ocean exploration.
p106
aVIt's something that's not limited to the James Camerons of the world,
p107
aVbut something that we're all participating in.
p108
aVIt's an underwater world
p109
aVwe're all exploring together.
