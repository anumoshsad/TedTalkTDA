VBy birth and by choice,
p4
aVI've been involved with the auto industry my entire life,
p5
aVand for the past 30 years,
p6
aVI've worked at Ford Motor Company.
p7
aVAnd for most of those years,
p8
aVI worried about,
p9
aVhow am I going to sell more cars and trucks?
p10
aVBut today I worry about,
p11
aVwhat if all we do is sell more cars and trucks?
p12
aVWhat happens
p13
aVwhen the number of vehicles on the road doubles, triples,
p14
aVor even quadruples?
p15
aa(lp16
VMy life is guided by two great passions,
p17
aVand the first is automobiles.
p18
aVI literally grew up with the Ford Motor Company.
p19
aVI thought it was so cool as a little boy
p20
aVwhen my dad would bring home the latest Ford or Lincoln
p21
aVand leave it in the driveway.
p22
aVAnd I decided about that time, about age 10,
p23
aVthat it would be really cool if I was a test driver.
p24
aVSo my parents would go to dinner.
p25
aVThey'd sit down; I'd sneak out of the house.
p26
aVI'd jump behind the wheel and take the new model around the driveway,
p27
aVand it was a blast.
p28
aVAnd that went on for about two years,
p29
aVuntil \u2014 I think I was about 12 \u2014
p30
aVmy dad brought home
p31
aVa Lincoln Mark III.
p32
aVAnd it was snowing that day.
p33
aVSo he and mom went to dinner,
p34
aVand I snuck out
p35
aVand thought it'd be really cool to do donuts
p36
aVor even some figure-eights in the snow.
p37
aVMy dad finished dinner early that evening.
p38
aVAnd he was walking to the front hall
p39
aVand out the front door
p40
aVjust about the same time I hit some ice
p41
aVand met him at the front door with the car \u2014
p42
aVand almost ended up in the front hall.
p43
aVSo it kind of cooled my test-driving for a little while.
p44
aVBut I really began to love cars then.
p45
aVAnd my first car was a 1975 electric-green Mustang.
p46
aVAnd even though the color was pretty hideous,
p47
aVI did love the car,
p48
aVand it really cemented my love affair with cars
p49
aVthat's continued on to this day.
p50
aa(lp51
VBut cars are really more than a passion of mine;
p52
aVthey're quite literally in my blood.
p53
aVMy great grandfather was Henry Ford,
p54
aVand on my mother's side,
p55
aVmy great grandfather was Harvey Firestone.
p56
aVSo when I was born,
p57
aVI guess you could say expectations were kind of high for me.
p58
aVBut my great grandfather, Henry Ford,
p59
aVreally believed that the mission of the Ford Motor Company
p60
aVwas to make people's lives better
p61
aVand make cars affordable so that everyone could have them.
p62
aVBecause he believed that with mobility
p63
aVcomes freedom and progress.
p64
aVAnd that's a belief that I share.
p65
aa(lp66
VMy other great passion is the environment.
p67
aVAnd as a young boy, I used to go up to Northern Michigan
p68
aVand fish in the rivers that Hemingway fished in
p69
aVand then later wrote about.
p70
aVAnd it really struck me
p71
aVas the years went by,
p72
aVin a very negative way,
p73
aVwhen I would go to some stream that I'd loved,
p74
aVand was used to walking through this field
p75
aVthat was once filled with fireflies,
p76
aVand now had a strip mall or a bunch of condos on it.
p77
aVAnd so even at a young age,
p78
aVthat really resonated with me,
p79
aVand the whole notion of environmental preservation,
p80
aVat a very basic level, sunk in with me.
p81
aa(lp82
VAs a high-schooler, I started to read
p83
aVauthors like Thoreau and Aldo Leopold
p84
aVand Edward Abbey,
p85
aVand I really began to develop
p86
aVa deeper appreciation of the natural world.
p87
aVBut it never really occurred to me
p88
aVthat my love of cars and trucks
p89
aVwould ever be in conflict with nature.
p90
aVAnd that was true
p91
aVuntil I got to college.
p92
aVAnd when I got to college, you can imagine my surprise
p93
aVwhen I would go to class
p94
aVand a number of my professors would say
p95
aVthat Ford Motor Company and my family
p96
aVwas everything that was wrong with our country.
p97
aVThey thought that we were more interested, as an industry,
p98
aVin profits, rather than progress,
p99
aVand that we filled the skies with smog \u2014
p100
aVand frankly, we were the enemy.
p101
aa(lp102
VI joined Ford after college,
p103
aVafter some soul searching
p104
aVwhether or not this is really the right thing to do.
p105
aVBut I decided that I wanted to go
p106
aVand see if I could affect change there.
p107
aVAnd as I look back over 30 years ago,
p108
aVit was a little naive to think at that age
p109
aVthat I could. But I wanted to.
p110
aVAnd I really discovered
p111
aVthat my professors weren't completely wrong.
p112
aVIn fact, when I got back to Detroit,
p113
aVmy environmental leanings weren't exactly embraced
p114
aVby those in my own company,
p115
aVand certainly by those in the industry.
p116
aVI had some very interesting conversations,
p117
aVas you can imagine.
p118
aVThere were some within Ford
p119
aVwho believed that all this ecological nonsense
p120
aVshould just disappear
p121
aVand that I needed to stop hanging out
p122
aVwith "environmental wackos."
p123
aVI was considered a radical.
p124
aVAnd I'll never forget the day I was called in by a member of top management
p125
aVand told to stop associating
p126
aVwith any known or suspected environmentalists.
p127
aV(Laughter)
p128
aVOf course, I had no intention of doing that,
p129
aVand I kept speaking out about the environment,
p130
aVand it really was the topic
p131
aVthat we now today call sustainability.
p132
aVAnd in time, my views went from controversial
p133
aVto more or less consensus today.
p134
aVI mean, I think most people in the industry
p135
aVunderstand that we've got to get on with it.
p136
aa(lp137
VAnd the good news is today we are tackling the big issues,
p138
aVof cars and the environment \u2014
p139
aVnot only at Ford, but really as an industry.
p140
aVWe're pushing fuel efficiency to new heights.
p141
aVAnd with new technology,
p142
aVwe're reducing \u2014 and I believe, someday we'll eliminate \u2014
p143
aVCO2 emissions.
p144
aVWe're starting to sell electric cars, which is great.
p145
aVWe're developing alternative powertrains
p146
aVthat are going to make cars affordable
p147
aVin every sense of the word \u2014
p148
aVeconomically, socially
p149
aVand environmentally.
p150
aVAnd actually, although we've got a long way to go
p151
aVand a lot of work to do,
p152
aVI can see the day where my two great passions \u2014
p153
aVcars and the environment \u2014
p154
aVactually come into harmony.
p155
aa(lp156
VBut unfortunately,
p157
aVas we're on our way to solving one monstrous problem \u2014
p158
aVand as I said, we're not there yet; we've got a lot of work to do,
p159
aVbut I can see where we will \u2014
p160
aVbut even as we're in the process of doing that,
p161
aVanother huge problem is looming,
p162
aVand people aren't noticing.
p163
aVAnd that is the freedom of mobility
p164
aVthat my great grandfather brought to people
p165
aVis now being threatened, just as the environment is.
p166
aVThe problem, put in its simplest terms,
p167
aVis one of mathematics.
p168
aVToday there are approximately 6.8 billion people in the world,
p169
aVand within our lifetime, that number's going to grow
p170
aVto about nine billion.
p171
aVAnd at that population level,
p172
aVour planet will be dealing with the limits of growth.
p173
aVAnd with that growth
p174
aVcomes some severe practical problems,
p175
aVone of which is our transportation system
p176
aVsimply won't be able to deal with it.
p177
aa(lp178
VWhen we look at the population growth in terms of cars,
p179
aVit becomes even clearer.
p180
aVToday there are about 800 million cars on the road worldwide.
p181
aVBut with more people
p182
aVand greater prosperity around the world,
p183
aVthat number's going to grow
p184
aVto between two and four billion cars by mid century.
p185
aVAnd this is going to create the kind of global gridlock
p186
aVthat the world has never seen before.
p187
aVNow think about the impact
p188
aVthat this is going to have on our daily lives.
p189
aVToday the average American
p190
aVspends about a week a year
p191
aVstuck in traffic jams,
p192
aVand that's a huge waste of time and resources.
p193
aVBut that's nothing compared
p194
aVto what's going on
p195
aVin the nations that are growing the fastest.
p196
aVToday the average driver in Beijing
p197
aVhas a five-hour commute.
p198
aVAnd last summer \u2014 many of you probably saw this \u2014
p199
aVthere was a hundred-mile traffic jam
p200
aVthat took 11 days to clear in China.
p201
aVIn the decades to come,
p202
aV75 percent of the world's population
p203
aVwill live in cities,
p204
aVand 50 of those cities
p205
aVwill be of 10 million people or more.
p206
aa(lp207
VSo you can see the size of the issue that we're facing.
p208
aVWhen you factor in population growth,
p209
aVit's clear that the mobility model that we have today
p210
aVsimply will not work tomorrow.
p211
aVFrankly, four billion clean cars on the road
p212
aVare still four billion cars,
p213
aVand a traffic jam with no emissions
p214
aVis still a traffic jam.
p215
aVSo, if we make no changes today,
p216
aVwhat does tomorrow look like?
p217
aVWell I think you probably already have the picture.
p218
aVTraffic jams are just a symptom of this challenge,
p219
aVand they're really very, very inconvenient,
p220
aVbut that's all they are.
p221
aVBut the bigger issue
p222
aVis that global gridlock
p223
aVis going to stifle economic growth
p224
aVand our ability to deliver
p225
aVfood and health care,
p226
aVparticularly to people that live in city centers.
p227
aVAnd our quality of life is going to be severely compromised.
p228
aVSo what's going to solve this?
p229
aa(lp230
VWell the answer isn't going to be more of the same.
p231
aVMy great grandfather once said
p232
aVbefore he invented the Model T,
p233
aV"If I had asked people then what they wanted,
p234
aVthey would have answered,
p235
aV'We want faster horses.'"
p236
aVSo the answer to more cars
p237
aVis simply not to have more roads.
p238
aVWhen America began moving west,
p239
aVwe didn't add more wagon trains,
p240
aVwe built railroads.
p241
aVAnd to connect our country after World War II,
p242
aVwe didn't build more two-lane highways,
p243
aVwe built the interstate highway system.
p244
aVToday we need that same leap in thinking
p245
aVfor us to create a viable future.
p246
aVWe are going to build smart cars,
p247
aVbut we also need to build
p248
aVsmart roads, smart parking,
p249
aVsmart public transportation systems and more.
p250
aVWe don't want to waste our time
p251
aVsitting in traffic, sitting at tollbooths
p252
aVor looking for parking spots.
p253
aVWe need an integrated system
p254
aVthat uses real time data
p255
aVto optimize personal mobility on a massive scale
p256
aVwithout hassle or compromises for travelers.
p257
aVAnd frankly, that's the kind of system
p258
aVthat's going to make the future of personal mobility sustainable.
p259
aa(lp260
VNow the good news is some of this work has already begun
p261
aVin different parts of the world.
p262
aVThe city of Masdar in Abu Dhabi
p263
aVuses driverless electric vehicles
p264
aVthat can communicate with one another,
p265
aVand they go underneath the city streets.
p266
aVAnd up above, you've got a series of pedestrian walkways.
p267
aVOn New York City's 34th Street,
p268
aVgridlock will soon be replaced
p269
aVwith a connected system
p270
aVof vehicle-specific corridors.
p271
aVPedestrian zones and dedicated traffic lanes are going to be created,
p272
aVand all of this will cut down the average rush hour commute
p273
aVto get across town in New York
p274
aVfrom about an hour today at rush hour
p275
aVto about 20 minutes.
p276
aVNow if you look at Hong Kong,
p277
aVthey have a very interesting system called Octopus there.
p278
aVIt's a system that really ties together
p279
aVall the transportation assets
p280
aVinto a single payment system.
p281
aVSo parking garages, buses, trains,
p282
aVthey all operate within the same system.
p283
aVNow shared car services
p284
aVare also springing up around the world,
p285
aVand these efforts, I think, are great.
p286
aVThey're relieving congestion,
p287
aVand they're frankly starting to save some fuel.
p288
aa(lp289
VThese are all really good ideas
p290
aVthat will move us forward.
p291
aVBut what really inspires me
p292
aVis what's going to be possible
p293
aVwhen our cars can begin talking to each other.
p294
aVVery soon, the same systems that we use today
p295
aVto bring music and entertainment
p296
aVand GPS information into our vehicles
p297
aVare going to be used to create
p298
aVa smart vehicle network.
p299
aVEvery morning I drive about 30 miles
p300
aVfrom my home in Ann Arbor to my office in Dearborn, Michigan.
p301
aVAnd every night I go home,
p302
aVmy commute is a total crapshoot.
p303
aVAnd I often have to leave the freeway
p304
aVand look for different ways
p305
aVfor me to try and make it home.
p306
aVBut very soon we're going to see the days
p307
aVwhen cars are essentially talking to each other.
p308
aVSo if the car ahead of me on I-94 hits traffic,
p309
aVit will immediately alert my car
p310
aVand tell my car to reroute itself
p311
aVto get me home in the best possible way.
p312
aVAnd these systems are being tested right now,
p313
aVand frankly they're going to be ready for prime time pretty soon.
p314
aa(lp315
VBut the potential of a connected car network
p316
aVis almost limitless.
p317
aVSo just imagine:
p318
aVone day very soon,
p319
aVyou're going to be able to plan a trip downtown
p320
aVand your car will be connected to a smart parking system.
p321
aVSo you get in your car,
p322
aVand as you get in your car,
p323
aVyour car will reserve you a parking spot before you arrive \u2014
p324
aVno more driving around looking for one,
p325
aVwhich frankly is one of the biggest users of fuel
p326
aVin today's cars in urban areas \u2014
p327
aVis looking for parking spots.
p328
aVOr think about being in New York City
p329
aVand tracking down an intelligent cab on your smart phone
p330
aVso you don't have to wait in the cold to hail one.
p331
aVOr being at a future TED Conference
p332
aVand having your car
p333
aVtalk to the calendars of everybody here
p334
aVand telling you all the best route to take home
p335
aVand when you should leave
p336
aVso that you can all arrive at your next destination on time.
p337
aVThis is the kind of technology
p338
aVthat will merge millions of individual vehicles
p339
aVinto a single system.
p340
aa(lp341
VSo I think it's clear we have the beginnings of a solution
p342
aVto this enormous problem.
p343
aVBut as we found out with addressing CO2 issues,
p344
aVand also fossil fuels,
p345
aVthere is no one silver bullet.
p346
aVThe solution is not going to be
p347
aVmore cars, more roads or a new rail system;
p348
aVit can only be found, I believe,
p349
aVin a global network
p350
aVof interconnected solutions.
p351
aVNow I know we can develop the technology
p352
aVthat's going to make this work,
p353
aVbut we've got to be willing to get out there
p354
aVand seek out the solutions \u2014
p355
aVwhether that means vehicle sharing or public transportation
p356
aVor some other way we haven't even thought of yet;
p357
aVour overall transportation-mix and infrastructure
p358
aVmust support all the future options.
p359
aa(lp360
VWe need our best and our brightest
p361
aVto start entertaining this issue.
p362
aVCompanies, entrepreneurs, venture capitalists,
p363
aVthey all need to understand
p364
aVthis is a huge business opportunity,
p365
aVas well as an enormous social problem.
p366
aVAnd just as these groups
p367
aVembrace the green energy challenge \u2014
p368
aVand it's really been amazing to me to watch
p369
aVhow much brain power, how much money
p370
aVand how much serious thought
p371
aVhas, really over the last three years,
p372
aVjust poured into the green energy field.
p373
aVWe need that same kind of passion and energy
p374
aVto attack global gridlock.
p375
aVBut we need people like all of you in this room,
p376
aVleading thinkers.
p377
aVI mean, frankly, I need all of you
p378
aVto think about how
p379
aVyou can help solve this huge issue.
p380
aVAnd we need people from all walks of life;
p381
aVnot just inventors, we need policymakers
p382
aVand government officials
p383
aVto also think about how they're going to respond to this challenge.
p384
aa(lp385
VThis isn't going to be solved
p386
aVby any one person or one group.
p387
aVIt's going to really require a national energy policy,
p388
aVfrankly for each country,
p389
aVbecause the solutions in each country are going to be different
p390
aVbased upon income levels, traffic jams
p391
aVand also how integrated
p392
aVthe systems already are.
p393
aVBut we need to get going, and we need to get going today.
p394
aVAnd we must have an infrastructure
p395
aVthat's designed to support
p396
aVthis flexible future.
p397
aa(lp398
VYou know, we've come a long way.
p399
aVSince the Model T,
p400
aVmost people never traveled
p401
aVmore than 25 miles from home in their entire lifetime.
p402
aVAnd since then,
p403
aVthe automobile has allowed us the freedom
p404
aVto choose where we live, where we work,
p405
aVwhere we play
p406
aVand frankly when we just go out and want to move around.
p407
aVWe don't want to regress and lose that freedom.
p408
aVWe're on our way to solving \u2014
p409
aVand as I said earlier, I know we've got a long way to go \u2014
p410
aVthe one big issue that we're all focused on that threatens it,
p411
aVand that's the environmental issue,
p412
aVbut I believe we all must turn
p413
aVall of our effort and all of our ingenuity and determination
p414
aVto help now solve this notion of global gridlock.
p415
aVBecause in doing so,
p416
aVwe're going to preserve what we've really come to take for granted,
p417
aVwhich is the freedom to move
p418
aVand move very effortlessly around the world.
p419
aVAnd it frankly will enhance our quality of life
p420
aVif we fix this.
p421
aVBecause, if you can envision, as I do,
p422
aVa future of zero emissions
p423
aVand freedom to move around the country and around the world
p424
aVlike we take for granted today,
p425
aVthat's worth the hard work today
p426
aVto preserve that for tomorrow.
p427
aa(lp428
VI believe we're at our best
p429
aVwhen we're confronted with big issues.
p430
aVThis is a big one, and it won't wait.
p431
aVSo let's get started now.
p432
