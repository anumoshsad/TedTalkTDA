p4
aVthe Nobel Prize in physics
p5
aVwas awarded to two teams of astronomers
p6
aVfor a discovery that has been hailed
p7
aVas one of the most important
p8
aVastronomical observations ever.
p9
aVAnd today, after briefly describing what they found,
p10
aVI'm going to tell you about a highly controversial framework
p11
aVfor explaining their discovery,
p12
aVnamely the possibility
p13
aVthat way beyond the Earth,
p14
aVthe Milky Way and other distant galaxies,
p15
aVwe may find that our universe
p16
aVis not the only universe,
p17
aVbut is instead
p18
aVpart of a vast complex of universes
p19
aVthat we call the multiverse.
p20
aa(lp21
VNow the idea of a multiverse is a strange one.
p22
aVI mean, most of us were raised to believe
p23
aVthat the word "universe" means everything.
p24
aVAnd I say most of us with forethought,
p25
aVas my four-year-old daughter has heard me speak of these ideas since she was born.
p26
aVAnd last year I was holding her
p27
aVand I said, "Sophia,
p28
aVI love you more than anything in the universe."
p29
aVAnd she turned to me and said, "Daddy,
p30
aVuniverse or multiverse?"
p31
aV(Laughter)
p32
aa(lp33
VBut barring such an anomalous upbringing,
p34
aVit is strange to imagine
p35
aVother realms separate from ours,
p36
aVmost with fundamentally different features,
p37
aVthat would rightly be called universes of their own.
p38
aVAnd yet,
p39
aVspeculative though the idea surely is,
p40
aVI aim to convince you
p41
aVthat there's reason for taking it seriously,
p42
aVas it just might be right.
p43
aVI'm going to tell the story of the multiverse in three parts.
p44
aVIn part one,
p45
aVI'm going to describe those Nobel Prize-winning results
p46
aVand to highlight a profound mystery
p47
aVwhich those results revealed.
p48
aVIn part two,
p49
aVI'll offer a solution to that mystery.
p50
aVIt's based on an approach called string theory,
p51
aVand that's where the idea of the multiverse
p52
aVwill come into the story.
p53
aVFinally, in part three,
p54
aVI'm going to describe a cosmological theory
p55
aVcalled inflation,
p56
aVwhich will pull all the pieces of the story together.
p57
aa(lp58
VOkay, part one starts back in 1929
p59
aVwhen the great astronomer Edwin Hubble
p60
aVrealized that the distant galaxies
p61
aVwere all rushing away from us,
p62
aVestablishing that space itself is stretching,
p63
aVit's expanding.
p64
aVNow this was revolutionary.
p65
aVThe prevailing wisdom was that on the largest of scales
p66
aVthe universe was static.
p67
aVBut even so,
p68
aVthere was one thing that everyone was certain of:
p69
aVThe expansion must be slowing down.
p70
aVThat, much as the gravitational pull of the Earth
p71
aVslows the ascent of an apple tossed upward,
p72
aVthe gravitational pull
p73
aVof each galaxy on every other
p74
aVmust be slowing
p75
aVthe expansion of space.
p76
aa(lp77
VNow let's fast-forward to the 1990s
p78
aVwhen those two teams of astronomers
p79
aVI mentioned at the outset
p80
aVwere inspired by this reasoning
p81
aVto measure the rate
p82
aVat which the expansion has been slowing.
p83
aVAnd they did this
p84
aVby painstaking observations
p85
aVof numerous distant galaxies,
p86
aVallowing them to chart
p87
aVhow the expansion rate has changed over time.
p88
aVHere's the surprise:
p89
aVThey found that the expansion is not slowing down.
p90
aVInstead they found that it's speeding up,
p91
aVgoing faster and faster.
p92
aVThat's like tossing an apple upward
p93
aVand it goes up faster and faster.
p94
aVNow if you saw an apple do that,
p95
aVyou'd want to know why.
p96
aVWhat's pushing on it?
p97
aa(lp98
VSimilarly, the astronomers' results
p99
aVare surely well-deserving of the Nobel Prize,
p100
aVbut they raised an analogous question.
p101
aVWhat force is driving all galaxies
p102
aVto rush away from every other
p103
aVat an ever-quickening speed?
p104
aVWell the most promising answer
p105
aVcomes from an old idea of Einstein's.
p106
aVYou see, we are all used to gravity
p107
aVbeing a force that does one thing,
p108
aVpulls objects together.
p109
aVBut in Einstein's theory of gravity,
p110
aVhis general theory of relativity,
p111
aVgravity can also push things apart.
p112
aa(lp113
VHow? Well according to Einstein's math,
p114
aVif space is uniformly filled
p115
aVwith an invisible energy,
p116
aVsort of like a uniform, invisible mist,
p117
aVthen the gravity generated by that mist
p118
aVwould be repulsive,
p119
aVrepulsive gravity,
p120
aVwhich is just what we need to explain the observations.
p121
aVBecause the repulsive gravity
p122
aVof an invisible energy in space \u2014
p123
aVwe now call it dark energy,
p124
aVbut I've made it smokey white here so you can see it \u2014
p125
aVits repulsive gravity
p126
aVwould cause each galaxy to push against every other,
p127
aVdriving expansion to speed up,
p128
aVnot slow down.
p129
aVAnd this explanation
p130
aVrepresents great progress.
p131
aa(lp132
VBut I promised you a mystery
p133
aVhere in part one.
p134
aVHere it is.
p135
aVWhen the astronomers worked out
p136
aVhow much of this dark energy
p137
aVmust be infusing space
p138
aVto account for the cosmic speed up,
p139
aVlook at what they found.
p140
aVThis number is small.
p141
aVExpressed in the relevant unit,
p142
aVit is spectacularly small.
p143
aVAnd the mystery is to explain this peculiar number.
p144
aVWe want this number
p145
aVto emerge from the laws of physics,
p146
aVbut so far no one has found a way to do that.
p147
aa(lp148
VNow you might wonder,
p149
aVshould you care?
p150
aVMaybe explaining this number
p151
aVis just a technical issue,
p152
aVa technical detail of interest to experts,
p153
aVbut of no relevance to anybody else.
p154
aVWell it surely is a technical detail,
p155
aVbut some details really matter.
p156
aVSome details provide
p157
aVwindows into uncharted realms of reality,
p158
aVand this peculiar number may be doing just that,
p159
aVas the only approach that's so far made headway to explain it
p160
aVinvokes the possibility of other universes \u2014
p161
aVan idea that naturally emerges from string theory,
p162
aVwhich takes me to part two: string theory.
p163
aa(lp164
VSo hold the mystery of the dark energy
p165
aVin the back of your mind
p166
aVas I now go on to tell you
p167
aVthree key things about string theory.
p168
aVFirst off, what is it?
p169
aVWell it's an approach to realize Einstein's dream
p170
aVof a unified theory of physics,
p171
aVa single overarching framework
p172
aVthat would be able to describe
p173
aVall the forces at work in the universe.
p174
aVAnd the central idea of string theory
p175
aVis quite straightforward.
p176
aVIt says that if you examine
p177
aVany piece of matter ever more finely,
p178
aVat first you'll find molecules
p179
aVand then you'll find atoms and subatomic particles.
p180
aVBut the theory says that if you could probe smaller,
p181
aVmuch smaller than we can with existing technology,
p182
aVyou'd find something else inside these particles \u2014
p183
aVa little tiny vibrating filament of energy,
p184
aVa little tiny vibrating string.
p185
aVAnd just like the strings on a violin,
p186
aVthey can vibrate in different patterns
p187
aVproducing different musical notes.
p188
aVThese little fundamental strings,
p189
aVwhen they vibrate in different patterns,
p190
aVthey produce different kinds of particles \u2014
p191
aVso electrons, quarks, neutrinos, photons,
p192
aVall other particles
p193
aVwould be united into a single framework,
p194
aVas they would all arise from vibrating strings.
p195
aVIt's a compelling picture,
p196
aVa kind of cosmic symphony,
p197
aVwhere all the richness
p198
aVthat we see in the world around us
p199
aVemerges from the music
p200
aVthat these little, tiny strings can play.
p201
aa(lp202
VBut there's a cost
p203
aVto this elegant unification,
p204
aVbecause years of research
p205
aVhave shown that the math of string theory doesn't quite work.
p206
aVIt has internal inconsistencies,
p207
aVunless we allow
p208
aVfor something wholly unfamiliar \u2014
p209
aVextra dimensions of space.
p210
aVThat is, we all know about the usual three dimensions of space.
p211
aVAnd you can think about those
p212
aVas height, width and depth.
p213
aVBut string theory says that, on fantastically small scales,
p214
aVthere are additional dimensions
p215
aVcrumpled to a tiny size so small
p216
aVthat we have not detected them.
p217
aVBut even though the dimensions are hidden,
p218
aVthey would have an impact on things that we can observe
p219
aVbecause the shape of the extra dimensions
p220
aVconstrains how the strings can vibrate.
p221
aVAnd in string theory,
p222
aVvibration determines everything.
p223
aVSo particle masses, the strengths of forces,
p224
aVand most importantly, the amount of dark energy
p225
aVwould be determined
p226
aVby the shape of the extra dimensions.
p227
aVSo if we knew the shape of the extra dimensions,
p228
aVwe should be able to calculate these features,
p229
aVcalculate the amount of dark energy.
p230
aa(lp231
VThe challenge
p232
aVis we don't know
p233
aVthe shape of the extra dimensions.
p234
aVAll we have
p235
aVis a list of candidate shapes
p236
aVallowed by the math.
p237
aVNow when these ideas were first developed,
p238
aVthere were only about five different candidate shapes,
p239
aVso you can imagine
p240
aVanalyzing them one-by-one
p241
aVto determine if any yield
p242
aVthe physical features we observe.
p243
aVBut over time the list grew
p244
aVas researchers found other candidate shapes.
p245
aVFrom five, the number grew into the hundreds and then the thousands \u2014
p246
aVA large, but still manageable, collection to analyze,
p247
aVsince after all,
p248
aVgraduate students need something to do.
p249
aVBut then the list continued to grow
p250
aVinto the millions and the billions, until today.
p251
aVThe list of candidate shapes
p252
aVhas soared to about 10 to the 500.
p253
aa(lp254
VSo, what to do?
p255
aVWell some researchers lost heart,
p256
aVconcluding that was so many candidate shapes for the extra dimensions,
p257
aVeach giving rise to different physical features,
p258
aVstring theory would never make
p259
aVdefinitive, testable predictions.
p260
aVBut others turned this issue on its head,
p261
aVtaking us to the possibility of a multiverse.
p262
aVHere's the idea.
p263
aVMaybe each of these shapes is on an equal footing with every other.
p264
aVEach is as real as every other,
p265
aVin the sense
p266
aVthat there are many universes,
p267
aVeach with a different shape, for the extra dimensions.
p268
aVAnd this radical proposal
p269
aVhas a profound impact on this mystery:
p270
aVthe amount of dark energy revealed by the Nobel Prize-winning results.
p271
aa(lp272
VBecause you see,
p273
aVif there are other universes,
p274
aVand if those universes
p275
aVeach have, say, a different shape for the extra dimensions,
p276
aVthen the physical features of each universe will be different,
p277
aVand in particular,
p278
aVthe amount of dark energy in each universe
p279
aVwill be different.
p280
aVWhich means that the mystery
p281
aVof explaining the amount of dark energy we've now measured
p282
aVwould take on a wholly different character.
p283
aVIn this context,
p284
aVthe laws of physics can't explain one number for the dark energy
p285
aVbecause there isn't just one number,
p286
aVthere are many numbers.
p287
aVWhich means
p288
aVwe have been asking the wrong question.
p289
aVIt's that the right question to ask is,
p290
aVwhy do we humans find ourselves in a universe
p291
aVwith a particular amount of dark energy we've measured
p292
aVinstead of any of the other possibilities
p293
aVthat are out there?
p294
aa(lp295
VAnd that's a question on which we can make headway.
p296
aVBecause those universes
p297
aVthat have much more dark energy than ours,
p298
aVwhenever matter tries to clump into galaxies,
p299
aVthe repulsive push of the dark energy is so strong
p300
aVthat it blows the clump apart
p301
aVand galaxies don't form.
p302
aVAnd in those universes that have much less dark energy,
p303
aVwell they collapse back on themselves so quickly
p304
aVthat, again, galaxies don't form.
p305
aVAnd without galaxies, there are no stars, no planets
p306
aVand no chance
p307
aVfor our form of life
p308
aVto exist in those other universes.
p309
aa(lp310
VSo we find ourselves in a universe
p311
aVwith the particular amount of dark energy we've measured
p312
aVsimply because our universe has conditions
p313
aVhospitable to our form of life.
p314
aVAnd that would be that.
p315
aVMystery solved,
p316
aVmultiverse found.
p317
aVNow some find this explanation unsatisfying.
p318
aVWe're used to physics
p319
aVgiving us definitive explanations for the features we observe.
p320
aVBut the point is,
p321
aVif the feature you're observing
p322
aVcan and does take on
p323
aVa wide variety of different values
p324
aVacross the wider landscape of reality,
p325
aVthen thinking one explanation
p326
aVfor a particular value
p327
aVis simply misguided.
p328
aa(lp329
VAn early example
p330
aVcomes from the great astronomer Johannes Kepler
p331
aVwho was obsessed with understanding
p332
aVa different number \u2014
p333
aVwhy the Sun is 93 million miles away from the Earth.
p334
aVAnd he worked for decades trying to explain this number,
p335
aVbut he never succeeded, and we know why.
p336
aVKepler was asking
p337
aVthe wrong question.
p338
aa(lp339
VWe now know that there are many planets
p340
aVat a wide variety of different distances from their host stars.
p341
aVSo hoping that the laws of physics
p342
aVwill explain one particular number, 93 million miles,
p343
aVwell that is simply wrongheaded.
p344
aVInstead the right question to ask is,
p345
aVwhy do we humans find ourselves on a planet
p346
aVat this particular distance,
p347
aVinstead of any of the other possibilities?
p348
aVAnd again, that's a question we can answer.
p349
aVThose planets which are much closer to a star like the Sun
p350
aVwould be so hot
p351
aVthat our form of life wouldn't exist.
p352
aVAnd those planets that are much farther away from the star,
p353
aVwell they're so cold
p354
aVthat, again, our form of life would not take hold.
p355
aVSo we find ourselves
p356
aVon a planet at this particular distance
p357
aVsimply because it yields conditions
p358
aVvital to our form of life.
p359
aVAnd when it comes to planets and their distances,
p360
aVthis clearly is the right kind of reasoning.
p361
aVThe point is,
p362
aVwhen it comes to universes and the dark energy that they contain,
p363
aVit may also be the right kind of reasoning.
p364
aa(lp365
VOne key difference, of course,
p366
aVis we know that there are other planets out there,
p367
aVbut so far I've only speculated on the possibility
p368
aVthat there might be other universes.
p369
aVSo to pull it all together,
p370
aVwe need a mechanism
p371
aVthat can actually generate other universes.
p372
aVAnd that takes me to my final part, part three.
p373
aVBecause such a mechanism has been found
p374
aVby cosmologists trying to understand the Big Bang.
p375
aVYou see, when we speak of the Big Bang,
p376
aVwe often have an image
p377
aVof a kind of cosmic explosion
p378
aVthat created our universe
p379
aVand set space rushing outward.
p380
aa(lp381
VBut there's a little secret.
p382
aVThe Big Bang leaves out something pretty important,
p383
aVthe Bang.
p384
aVIt tells us how the universe evolved after the Bang,
p385
aVbut gives us no insight
p386
aVinto what would have powered the Bang itself.
p387
aVAnd this gap was finally filled
p388
aVby an enhanced version of the Big Bang theory.
p389
aVIt's called inflationary cosmology,
p390
aVwhich identified a particular kind of fuel
p391
aVthat would naturally generate
p392
aVan outward rush of space.
p393
aVThe fuel is based on something called a quantum field,
p394
aVbut the only detail that matters for us
p395
aVis that this fuel proves to be so efficient
p396
aVthat it's virtually impossible
p397
aVto use it all up,
p398
aVwhich means in the inflationary theory,
p399
aVthe Big Bang giving rise to our universe
p400
aVis likely not a one-time event.
p401
aVInstead the fuel not only generated our Big Bang,
p402
aVbut it would also generate countless other Big Bangs,
p403
aVeach giving rise to its own separate universe
p404
aVwith our universe becoming but one bubble
p405
aVin a grand cosmic bubble bath of universes.
p406
aa(lp407
VAnd now, when we meld this with string theory,
p408
aVhere's the picture we're led to.
p409
aVEach of these universes has extra dimensions.
p410
aVThe extra dimensions take on a wide variety of different shapes.
p411
aVThe different shapes yield different physical features.
p412
aVAnd we find ourselves in one universe instead of another
p413
aVsimply because it's only in our universe
p414
aVthat the physical features, like the amount of dark energy,
p415
aVare right for our form of life to take hold.
p416
aVAnd this is the compelling but highly controversial picture
p417
aVof the wider cosmos
p418
aVthat cutting-edge observation and theory
p419
aVhave now led us to seriously consider.
p420
aa(lp421
VOne big remaining question, of course, is,
p422
aVcould we ever confirm
p423
aVthe existence of other universes?
p424
aVWell let me describe
p425
aVone way that might one day happen.
p426
aVThe inflationary theory
p427
aValready has strong observational support.
p428
aVBecause the theory predicts
p429
aVthat the Big Bang would have been so intense
p430
aVthat as space rapidly expanded,
p431
aVtiny quantum jitters from the micro world
p432
aVwould have been stretched out to the macro world,
p433
aVyielding a distinctive fingerprint,
p434
aVa pattern of slightly hotter spots and slightly colder spots,
p435
aVacross space,
p436
aVwhich powerful telescopes have now observed.
p437
aVGoing further, if there are other universes,
p438
aVthe theory predicts that every so often
p439
aVthose universes can collide.
p440
aVAnd if our universe got hit by another,
p441
aVthat collision
p442
aVwould generate an additional subtle pattern
p443
aVof temperature variations across space
p444
aVthat we might one day
p445
aVbe able to detect.
p446
aVAnd so exotic as this picture is,
p447
aVit may one day be grounded
p448
aVin observations,
p449
aVestablishing the existence of other universes.
p450
aa(lp451
VI'll conclude
p452
aVwith a striking implication
p453
aVof all these ideas
p454
aVfor the very far future.
p455
aVYou see, we learned
p456
aVthat our universe is not static,
p457
aVthat space is expanding,
p458
aVthat that expansion is speeding up
p459
aVand that there might be other universes
p460
aVall by carefully examining
p461
aVfaint pinpoints of starlight
p462
aVcoming to us from distant galaxies.
p463
aVBut because the expansion is speeding up,
p464
aVin the very far future,
p465
aVthose galaxies will rush away so far and so fast
p466
aVthat we won't be able to see them \u2014
p467
aVnot because of technological limitations,
p468
aVbut because of the laws of physics.
p469
aVThe light those galaxies emit,
p470
aVeven traveling at the fastest speed, the speed of light,
p471
aVwill not be able to overcome
p472
aVthe ever-widening gulf between us.
p473
aVSo astronomers in the far future
p474
aVlooking out into deep space
p475
aVwill see nothing but an endless stretch
p476
aVof static, inky, black stillness.
p477
aVAnd they will conclude
p478
aVthat the universe is static and unchanging
p479
aVand populated by a single central oasis of matter
p480
aVthat they inhabit \u2014
p481
aVa picture of the cosmos
p482
aVthat we definitively know to be wrong.
p483
aa(lp484
VNow maybe those future astronomers will have records
p485
aVhanded down from an earlier era,
p486
aVlike ours,
p487
aVattesting to an expanding cosmos
p488
aVteeming with galaxies.
p489
aVBut would those future astronomers
p490
aVbelieve such ancient knowledge?
p491
aVOr would they believe
p492
aVin the black, static empty universe
p493
aVthat their own state-of-the-art observations reveal?
p494
aVI suspect the latter.
p495
aVWhich means that we are living
p496
aVthrough a remarkably privileged era
p497
aVwhen certain deep truths about the cosmos
p498
aVare still within reach
p499
aVof the human spirit of exploration.
p500
aVIt appears that it may not always be that way.
p501
aVBecause today's astronomers,
p502
aVby turning powerful telescopes to the sky,
p503
aVhave captured a handful of starkly informative photons \u2014
p504
aVa kind of cosmic telegram
p505
aVbillions of years in transit.
p506
aVand the message echoing across the ages is clear.
p507
aVSometimes nature guards her secrets
p508
aVwith the unbreakable grip
p509
aVof physical law.
p510
aVSometimes the true nature of reality beckons
p511
aVfrom just beyond the horizon.

p518
aVThe range of ideas you've just spoken about
p519
aVare dizzying, exhilarating, incredible.
p520
aVHow do you think
p521
aVof where cosmology is now,
p522
aVin a sort of historical side?
p523
aVAre we in the middle of something unusual historically in your opinion?
p524
aa(lp525
VBG: Well it's hard to say.
p526
aVWhen we learn that astronomers of the far future
p527
aVmay not have enough information to figure things out,
p528
aVthe natural question is, maybe we're already in that position
p529
aVand certain deep, critical features of the universe
p530
aValready have escaped our ability to understand
p531
aVbecause of how cosmology evolves.
p532
aVSo from that perspective,
p533
aVmaybe we will always be asking questions
p534
aVand never be able to fully answer them.
p535
aa(lp536
VOn the other hand, we now can understand
p537
aVhow old the universe is.
p538
aVWe can understand
p539
aVhow to understand the data from the microwave background radiation
p540
aVthat was set down 13.72 billion years ago \u2014
p541
aVand yet, we can do calculations today to predict how it will look
p542
aVand it matches.
p543
aVHoly cow! That's just amazing.
p544
aVSo on the one hand, it's just incredible where we've gotten,
p545
aVbut who knows what sort of blocks we may find in the future.
p546
aa(lp547
VCA: You're going to be around for the next few days.
p548
aVMaybe some of these conversations can continue.
p549
