VTime flies.
p4
aVIt's actually almost 20 years ago
p5
aVwhen I wanted to reframe the way we use information,
p6
aVthe way we work together: I invented the World Wide Web.
p7
aVNow, 20 years on, at TED,
p8
aVI want to ask your help in a new reframing.
p9
aa(lp10
VSo going back to 1989,
p11
aVI wrote a memo suggesting the global hypertext system.
p12
aVNobody really did anything with it, pretty much.
p13
aVBut 18 months later \u2014 this is how innovation happens \u2014
p14
aV18 months later, my boss said I could do it on the side,
p15
aVas a sort of a play project,
p16
aVkick the tires of a new computer we'd got.
p17
aVAnd so he gave me the time to code it up.
p18
aVSo I basically roughed out what HTML should look like:
p19
aVhypertext protocol, HTTP;
p20
aVthe idea of URLs, these names for things
p21
aVwhich started with HTTP.
p22
aVI wrote the code and put it out there.
p23
aa(lp24
VWhy did I do it?
p25
aVWell, it was basically frustration.
p26
aVI was frustrated \u2014 I was working as a software engineer
p27
aVin this huge, very exciting lab,
p28
aVlots of people coming from all over the world.
p29
aVThey brought all sorts of different computers with them.
p30
aVThey had all sorts of different data formats,
p31
aVall sorts, all kinds of documentation systems.
p32
aVSo that, in all that diversity,
p33
aVif I wanted to figure out how to build something
p34
aVout of a bit of this and a bit of this,
p35
aVeverything I looked into, I had to connect to some new machine,
p36
aVI had to learn to run some new program,
p37
aVI would find the information I wanted in some new data format.
p38
aVAnd these were all incompatible.
p39
aVIt was just very frustrating.
p40
aVThe frustration was all this unlocked potential.
p41
aa(lp42
VIn fact, on all these discs there were documents.
p43
aVSo if you just imagined them all
p44
aVbeing part of some big, virtual documentation system in the sky,
p45
aVsay on the Internet,
p46
aVthen life would be so much easier.
p47
aVWell, once you've had an idea like that it kind of gets under your skin
p48
aVand even if people don't read your memo \u2014
p49
aVactually he did, it was found after he died, his copy.
p50
aVHe had written, "Vague, but exciting," in pencil, in the corner.
p51
aa(lp52
V(Laughter)
p53
aa(lp54
VBut in general it was difficult \u2014 it was really difficult to explain
p55
aVwhat the web was like.
p56
aVIt's difficult to explain to people now that it was difficult then.
p57
aVBut then \u2014 OK, when TED started, there was no web
p58
aVso things like "click" didn't have the same meaning.
p59
aVI can show somebody a piece of hypertext,
p60
aVa page which has got links,
p61
aVand we click on the link and bing \u2014 there'll be another hypertext page.
p62
aVNot impressive.
p63
aVYou know, we've seen that \u2014 we've got things on hypertext on CD-ROMs.
p64
aVWhat was difficult was to get them to imagine:
p65
aVso, imagine that that link could have gone
p66
aVto virtually any document you could imagine.
p67
aVAlright, that is the leap that was very difficult for people to make.
p68
aVWell, some people did.
p69
aVSo yeah, it was difficult to explain, but there was a grassroots movement.
p70
aVAnd that is what has made it most fun.
p71
aVThat has been the most exciting thing,
p72
aVnot the technology, not the things people have done with it,
p73
aVbut actually the community, the spirit of all these people
p74
aVgetting together, sending the emails.
p75
aVThat's what it was like then.
p76
aa(lp77
VDo you know what? It's funny, but right now it's kind of like that again.
p78
aVI asked everybody, more or less, to put their documents \u2014
p79
aVI said, "Could you put your documents on this web thing?"
p80
aVAnd you did.
p81
aVThanks.
p82
aVIt's been a blast, hasn't it?
p83
aVI mean, it has been quite interesting
p84
aVbecause we've found out that the things that happen with the web
p85
aVreally sort of blow us away.
p86
aVThey're much more than we'd originally imagined
p87
aVwhen we put together the little, initial website
p88
aVthat we started off with.
p89
aVNow, I want you to put your data on the web.
p90
aVTurns out that there is still huge unlocked potential.
p91
aVThere is still a huge frustration
p92
aVthat people have because we haven't got data on the web as data.
p93
aa(lp94
VWhat do you mean, "data"? What's the difference \u2014 documents, data?
p95
aVWell, documents you read, OK?
p96
aVMore or less, you read them, you can follow links from them, and that's it.
p97
aVData \u2014 you can do all kinds of stuff with a computer.
p98
aVWho was here or has otherwise seen Hans Rosling's talk?
p99
aVOne of the great \u2014 yes a lot of people have seen it \u2014
p100
aVone of the great TED Talks.
p101
aVHans put up this presentation
p102
aVin which he showed, for various different countries, in various different colors \u2014
p103
aVhe showed income levels on one axis
p104
aVand he showed infant mortality, and he shot this thing animated through time.
p105
aVSo, he'd taken this data and made a presentation
p106
aVwhich just shattered a lot of myths that people had
p107
aVabout the economics in the developing world.
p108
aa(lp109
VHe put up a slide a little bit like this.
p110
aVIt had underground all the data
p111
aVOK, data is brown and boxy and boring,
p112
aVand that's how we think of it, isn't it?
p113
aVBecause data you can't naturally use by itself
p114
aVBut in fact, data drives a huge amount of what happens in our lives
p115
aVand it happens because somebody takes that data and does something with it.
p116
aVIn this case, Hans had put the data together
p117
aVhe had found from all kinds of United Nations websites and things.
p118
aVHe had put it together,
p119
aVcombined it into something more interesting than the original pieces
p120
aVand then he'd put it into this software,
p121
aVwhich I think his son developed, originally,
p122
aVand produces this wonderful presentation.
p123
aVAnd Hans made a point
p124
aVof saying, "Look, it's really important to have a lot of data."
p125
aVAnd I was happy to see that at the party last night
p126
aVthat he was still saying, very forcibly, "It's really important to have a lot of data."
p127
aa(lp128
VSo I want us now to think about
p129
aVnot just two pieces of data being connected, or six like he did,
p130
aVbut I want to think about a world where everybody has put data on the web
p131
aVand so virtually everything you can imagine is on the web
p132
aVand then calling that linked data.
p133
aVThe technology is linked data, and it's extremely simple.
p134
aVIf you want to put something on the web there are three rules:
p135
aVfirst thing is that those HTTP names \u2014
p136
aVthose things that start with "http:" \u2014
p137
aVwe're using them not just for documents now,
p138
aVwe're using them for things that the documents are about.
p139
aVWe're using them for people, we're using them for places,
p140
aVwe're using them for your products, we're using them for events.
p141
aVAll kinds of conceptual things, they have names now that start with HTTP.
p142
aa(lp143
VSecond rule, if I take one of these HTTP names and I look it up
p144
aVand I do the web thing with it and I fetch the data
p145
aVusing the HTTP protocol from the web,
p146
aVI will get back some data in a standard format
p147
aVwhich is kind of useful data that somebody might like to know
p148
aVabout that thing, about that event.
p149
aVWho's at the event? Whatever it is about that person,
p150
aVwhere they were born, things like that.
p151
aVSo the second rule is I get important information back.
p152
aa(lp153
VThird rule is that when I get back that information
p154
aVit's not just got somebody's height and weight and when they were born,
p155
aVit's got relationships.
p156
aVData is relationships.
p157
aVInterestingly, data is relationships.
p158
aVThis person was born in Berlin; Berlin is in Germany.
p159
aVAnd when it has relationships, whenever it expresses a relationship
p160
aVthen the other thing that it's related to
p161
aVis given one of those names that starts HTTP.
p162
aVSo, I can go ahead and look that thing up.
p163
aVSo I look up a person \u2014 I can look up then the city where they were born; then
p164
aVI can look up the region it's in, and the town it's in,
p165
aVand the population of it, and so on.
p166
aVSo I can browse this stuff.
p167
aa(lp168
VSo that's it, really.
p169
aVThat is linked data.
p170
aVI wrote an article entitled "Linked Data" a couple of years ago
p171
aVand soon after that, things started to happen.
p172
aVThe idea of linked data is that we get lots and lots and lots
p173
aVof these boxes that Hans had,
p174
aVand we get lots and lots and lots of things sprouting.
p175
aVIt's not just a whole lot of other plants.
p176
aVIt's not just a root supplying a plant,
p177
aVbut for each of those plants, whatever it is \u2014
p178
aVa presentation, an analysis, somebody's looking for patterns in the data \u2014
p179
aVthey get to look at all the data
p180
aVand they get it connected together,
p181
aVand the really important thing about data
p182
aVis the more things you have to connect together, the more powerful it is.
p183
aa(lp184
VSo, linked data.
p185
aVThe meme went out there.
p186
aVAnd, pretty soon Chris Bizer at the Freie Universitat in Berlin
p187
aVwho was one of the first people to put interesting things up,
p188
aVhe noticed that Wikipedia \u2014
p189
aVyou know Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia
p190
aVwith lots and lots of interesting documents in it.
p191
aVWell, in those documents, there are little squares, little boxes.
p192
aVAnd in most information boxes, there's data.
p193
aVSo he wrote a program to take the data, extract it from Wikipedia,
p194
aVand put it into a blob of linked data
p195
aVon the web, which he called dbpedia.
p196
aVDbpedia is represented by the blue blob in the middle of this slide
p197
aVand if you actually go and look up Berlin,
p198
aVyou'll find that there are other blobs of data
p199
aVwhich also have stuff about Berlin, and they're linked together.
p200
aVSo if you pull the data from dbpedia about Berlin,
p201
aVyou'll end up pulling up these other things as well.
p202
aVAnd the exciting thing is it's starting to grow.
p203
aVThis is just the grassroots stuff again, OK?
p204
aa(lp205
VLet's think about data for a bit.
p206
aVData comes in fact in lots and lots of different forms.
p207
aVThink of the diversity of the web. It's a really important thing
p208
aVthat the web allows you to put all kinds of data up there.
p209
aVSo it is with data. I could talk about all kinds of data.
p210
aVWe could talk about government data, enterprise data is really important,
p211
aVthere's scientific data, there's personal data,
p212
aVthere's weather data, there's data about events,
p213
aVthere's data about talks, and there's news and there's all kinds of stuff.
p214
aVI'm just going to mention a few of them
p215
aVso that you get the idea of the diversity of it,
p216
aVso that you also see how much unlocked potential.
p217
aa(lp218
VLet's start with government data.
p219
aVBarack Obama said in a speech,
p220
aVthat he \u2014 American government data would be available on the Internet
p221
aVin accessible formats.
p222
aVAnd I hope that they will put it up as linked data.
p223
aVThat's important. Why is it important?
p224
aVNot just for transparency, yeah transparency in government is important,
p225
aVbut that data \u2014 this is the data from all the government departments
p226
aVThink about how much of that data is about how life is lived in America.
p227
aVIt's actual useful. It's got value.
p228
aVI can use it in my company.
p229
aVI could use it as a kid to do my homework.
p230
aVSo we're talking about making the place, making the world run better
p231
aVby making this data available.
p232
aa(lp233
VIn fact if you're responsible \u2014 if you know about some data
p234
aVin a government department, often you find that
p235
aVthese people, they're very tempted to keep it \u2014
p236
aVHans calls it database hugging.
p237
aVYou hug your database, you don't want to let it go
p238
aVuntil you've made a beautiful website for it.
p239
aVWell, I'd like to suggest that rather \u2014
p240
aVyes, make a beautiful website,
p241
aVwho am I to say don't make a beautiful website?
p242
aVMake a beautiful website, but first
p243
aVgive us the unadulterated data,
p244
aVwe want the data.
p245
aVWe want unadulterated data.
p246
aVOK, we have to ask for raw data now.
p247
aVAnd I'm going to ask you to practice that, OK?
p248
aVCan you say "raw"?
p249
aa(lp250
VAudience: Raw.
p251
aa(lp252
VTim Berners-Lee: Can you say "data"?
p253
aa(lp254
VAudience: Data.
p255
aa(lp256
VTBL: Can you say "now"?
p257
aa(lp258
VAudience: Now!
p259
aa(lp260
VTBL: Alright, "raw data now"!
p261
aa(lp262
VAudience: Raw data now!
p263
aa(lp264
VPractice that. It's important because you have no idea the number of excuses
p265
aVpeople come up with to hang onto their data
p266
aVand not give it to you, even though you've paid for it as a taxpayer.
p267
aVAnd it's not just America. It's all over the world.
p268
aVAnd it's not just governments, of course \u2014 it's enterprises as well.
p269
aa(lp270
VSo I'm just going to mention a few other thoughts on data.
p271
aVHere we are at TED, and all the time we are very conscious
p272
aVof the huge challenges that human society has right now \u2014
p273
aVcuring cancer, understanding the brain for Alzheimer's,
p274
aVunderstanding the economy to make it a little bit more stable,
p275
aVunderstanding how the world works.
p276
aVThe people who are going to solve those \u2014 the scientists \u2014
p277
aVthey have half-formed ideas in their head,
p278
aVthey try to communicate those over the web.
p279
aVBut a lot of the state of knowledge of the human race at the moment
p280
aVis on databases, often sitting in their computers,
p281
aVand actually, currently not shared.
p282
aa(lp283
VIn fact, I'll just go into one area \u2014
p284
aVif you're looking at Alzheimer's, for example,
p285
aVdrug discovery \u2014 there is a whole lot of linked data which is just coming out
p286
aVbecause scientists in that field realize
p287
aVthis is a great way of getting out of those silos,
p288
aVbecause they had their genomics data in one database
p289
aVin one building, and they had their protein data in another.
p290
aVNow, they are sticking it onto \u2014 linked data \u2014
p291
aVand now they can ask the sort of question, that you probably wouldn't ask,
p292
aVI wouldn't ask \u2014 they would.
p293
aVWhat proteins are involved in signal transduction
p294
aVand also related to pyramidal neurons?
p295
aVWell, you take that mouthful and you put it into Google.
p296
aVOf course, there's no page on the web which has answered that question
p297
aVbecause nobody has asked that question before.
p298
aVYou get 223,000 hits \u2014
p299
aVno results you can use.
p300
aVYou ask the linked data \u2014 which they've now put together \u2014
p301
aV32 hits, each of which is a protein which has those properties
p302
aVand you can look at.
p303
aVThe power of being able to ask those questions, as a scientist \u2014
p304
aVquestions which actually bridge across different disciplines \u2014
p305
aVis really a complete sea change.
p306
aVIt's very very important.
p307
aVScientists are totally stymied at the moment \u2014
p308
aVthe power of the data that other scientists have collected is locked up
p309
aVand we need to get it unlocked so we can tackle those huge problems.
p310
aa(lp311
VNow if I go on like this, you'll think that all the data comes from huge institutions
p312
aVand has nothing to do with you.
p313
aVBut, that's not true.
p314
aVIn fact, data is about our lives.
p315
aVYou just \u2014 you log on to your social networking site,
p316
aVyour favorite one, you say, "This is my friend."
p317
aVBing! Relationship. Data.
p318
aVYou say, "This photograph, it's about \u2014 it depicts this person. "
p319
aVBing! That's data. Data, data, data.
p320
aVEvery time you do things on the social networking site,
p321
aVthe social networking site is taking data and using it \u2014 re-purposing it \u2014
p322
aVand using it to make other people's lives more interesting on the site.
p323
aVBut, when you go to another linked data site \u2014
p324
aVand let's say this is one about travel,
p325
aVand you say, "I want to send this photo to all the people in that group,"
p326
aVyou can't get over the walls.
p327
aVThe Economist wrote an article about it, and lots of people have blogged about it \u2014
p328
aVtremendous frustration.
p329
aVThe way to break down the silos is to get inter-operability
p330
aVbetween social networking sites.
p331
aVWe need to do that with linked data.
p332
aa(lp333
VOne last type of data I'll talk about, maybe it's the most exciting.
p334
aVBefore I came down here, I looked it up on OpenStreetMap
p335
aVThe OpenStreetMap's a map, but it's also a Wiki.
p336
aVZoom in and that square thing is a theater \u2014 which we're in right now \u2014
p337
aVThe Terrace Theater. It didn't have a name on it.
p338
aVSo I could go into edit mode, I could select the theater,
p339
aVI could add down at the bottom the name, and I could save it back.
p340
aVAnd now if you go back to the OpenStreetMap. org,
p341
aVand you find this place, you will find that The Terrace Theater has got a name.
p342
aVI did that. Me!
p343
aVI did that to the map. I just did that!
p344
aVI put that up on there. Hey, you know what?
p345
aVIf I \u2014 that street map is all about everybody doing their bit
p346
aVand it creates an incredible resource
p347
aVbecause everybody else does theirs.
p348
aVAnd that is what linked data is all about.
p349
aVIt's about people doing their bit
p350
aVto produce a little bit, and it all connecting.
p351
aVThat's how linked data works.
p352
aVYou do your bit. Everybody else does theirs.
p353
aVYou may not have lots of data which you have yourself to put on there
p354
aVbut you know to demand it.
p355
aVAnd we've practiced that.
p356
aa(lp357
VSo, linked data \u2014 it's huge.
p358
aVI've only told you a very small number of things
p359
aVThere are data in every aspect of our lives,
p360
aVevery aspect of work and pleasure,
p361
aVand it's not just about the number of places where data comes,
p362
aVit's about connecting it together.
p363
aVAnd when you connect data together, you get power
p364
aVin a way that doesn't happen just with the web, with documents.
p365
aVYou get this really huge power out of it.
p366
aVSo, we're at the stage now
p367
aVwhere we have to do this \u2014 the people who think it's a great idea.
p368
aVAnd all the people \u2014 and I think there's a lot of people at TED who do things because \u2014
p369
aVeven though there's not an immediate return on the investment
p370
aVbecause it will only really pay off when everybody else has done it \u2014
p371
aVthey'll do it because they're the sort of person who just does things
p372
aVwhich would be good if everybody else did them.
p373
aVOK, so it's called linked data.
p374
aVI want you to make it.
p375
aVI want you to demand it.
p376
aVAnd I think it's an idea worth spreading.
p377
