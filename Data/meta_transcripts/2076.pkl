VFor over a decade as a doctor,
p4
aVI've cared for homeless veterans,
p5
aVfor working-class families.
p6
aVI've cared for people who  live and work in conditions
p7
aVthat can be hard, if not harsh,
p8
aVand that work has led me to believe
p9
aVthat we need a fundamentally different way
p10
aVof looking at healthcare.
p11
aVWe simply need a healthcare system
p12
aVthat moves beyond just looking at the symptoms
p13
aVthat bring people into clinics,
p14
aVbut instead actually is able to look
p15
aVand improve health where it begins.
p16
aVAnd where health begins
p17
aVis not in the four walls of a doctor's office,
p18
aVbut where we live
p19
aVand where we work,
p20
aVwhere we eat, sleep, learn and play,
p21
aVwhere we spend the majority of our lives.
p22
aa(lp23
VSo what does this different  approach to healthcare look like,
p24
aVan approach that can improve health where it begins?
p25
aVTo illustrate this, I'll tell you about Veronica.
p26
aVVeronica was the 17th patient
p27
aVout of my 26-patient day
p28
aVat that clinic in South Central Los Angeles.
p29
aVShe came into our clinic with a chronic headache.
p30
aVThis headache had been going on
p31
aVfor a number of years, and this particular episode
p32
aVwas very, very troubling.
p33
aVIn fact, three weeks before she came to visit us
p34
aVfor the first time, she went to an  emergency room in Los Angeles.
p35
aVThe emergency room doctors said,
p36
aV"We've run some tests, Veronica.
p37
aVThe results are normal, so here's some pain medication,
p38
aVand follow up with a primary care doctor,
p39
aVbut if the pain persists or if it worsens,
p40
aVthen come on back."
p41
aa(lp42
VVeronica followed those standard instructions
p43
aVand she went back.
p44
aVShe went back not just once, but twice more.
p45
aVIn the three weeks before Veronica met us,
p46
aVshe went to the emergency room three times.
p47
aVShe went back and forth,
p48
aVin and out of hospitals and clinics,
p49
aVjust like she had done in years past,
p50
aVtrying to seek relief but still coming up short.
p51
aVVeronica came to our clinic,
p52
aVand despite all these encounters with healthcare professionals,
p53
aVVeronica was still sick.
p54
aa(lp55
VWhen she came to our clinic, though,  we tried a different approach.
p56
aVOur approach started with our medical assistant,
p57
aVsomeone who had a GED-level training
p58
aVbut knew the community.
p59
aVOur medical assistant asked some routine questions.
p60
aVShe asked, "What's your chief complaint?"
p61
aV"Headache."
p62
aV"Let's get your vital signs" \u2014
p63
aVmeasure your blood pressure and your heart rate,
p64
aVbut let's also ask something equally as vital
p65
aVto Veronica and a lot of patients like her
p66
aVin South Los Angeles.
p67
aV"Veronica, can you tell me about where you live?
p68
aVSpecifically, about your housing conditions?
p69
aVDo you have mold? Do you have water leaks?
p70
aVDo you have roaches in your home?"
p71
aVTurns out, Veronica said yes to three of those things:
p72
aVroaches, water leaks, mold.
p73
aVI received that chart in hand, reviewed it,
p74
aVand I turned the handle on the door
p75
aVand I entered the room.
p76
aa(lp77
VYou should understand that Veronica,
p78
aVlike a lot of patients that I have the privilege of caring for,
p79
aVis a dignified person, a formidable presence,
p80
aVa personality that's larger than life,
p81
aVbut here she was
p82
aVdoubled over in pain sitting on my exam table.
p83
aVHer head, clearly throbbing, was resting in her hands.
p84
aVShe lifted her head up,
p85
aVand I saw her face, said hello,
p86
aVand then I immediately noticed something
p87
aVacross the bridge of her nose,
p88
aVa crease in her skin.
p89
aVIn medicine, we call that crease the allergic salute.
p90
aVIt's usually seen among children who have chronic allergies.
p91
aVIt comes from chronically rubbing one's nose up and down,
p92
aVtrying to get rid of those allergy symptoms,
p93
aVand yet, here was Veronica, a grown woman,
p94
aVwith the same telltale sign of allergies.
p95
aVA few minutes later, in asking Veronica some questions,
p96
aVand examining her and listening to her,
p97
aVI said, "Veronica, I think I know what you have.
p98
aVI think you have chronic allergies,
p99
aVand I think you have migraine headaches and some sinus congestion,
p100
aVand I think all of those are  related to where you live."
p101
aVShe looked a little bit relieved,
p102
aVbecause for the first time, she had a diagnosis,
p103
aVbut I said, "Veronica, now let's talk about your treatment.
p104
aVWe're going to order some medications for your symptoms,
p105
aVbut I also want to refer you to a specialist, if that's okay."
p106
aa(lp107
VNow, specialists are a little hard to find
p108
aVin South Central Los Angeles,
p109
aVso she gave me this look, like, "Really?"
p110
aVAnd I said, "Veronica, actually, the specialist I'm talking about
p111
aVis someone I call a community health worker,
p112
aVsomeone who, if it's okay with you,
p113
aVcan come to your home
p114
aVand try to understand what's going on
p115
aVwith those water leaks and that mold,
p116
aVtrying to help you manage those conditions in your housing that I think are causing your symptoms,
p117
aVand if required, that specialist might refer you
p118
aVto another specialist that we call a public interest lawyer,
p119
aVbecause it might be that your landlord
p120
aVisn't making the fixes he's required to make."
p121
aa(lp122
VVeronica came back in a few months later.
p123
aVShe agreed to all of those treatment plans.
p124
aVShe told us that her symptoms had improved by 90 percent.
p125
aVShe was spending more time at work
p126
aVand with her family and less time
p127
aVshuttling back and forth between the emergency rooms of Los Angeles.
p128
aVVeronica had improved remarkably.
p129
aVHer sons, one of whom had asthma,
p130
aVwere no longer as sick as they used to be.
p131
aVShe had gotten better, and not coincidentally,
p132
aVVeronica's home was better too.
p133
aa(lp134
VWhat was it about this different approach we tried
p135
aVthat led to better care,
p136
aVfewer visits to the E.R., better health?
p137
aVWell, quite simply, it started with that question:
p138
aV"Veronica, where do you live?"
p139
aVBut more importantly, it was that we put in place
p140
aVa system that allowed us to routinely ask questions
p141
aVto Veronica and hundreds more like her
p142
aVabout the conditions that mattered
p143
aVin her community, about where health,
p144
aVand unfortunately sometimes illness, do begin
p145
aVin places like South L.A.
p146
aVIn that community, substandard housing
p147
aVand food insecurity are the major conditions
p148
aVthat we as a clinic had to be aware of,
p149
aVbut in other communities it could be
p150
aVtransportation barriers, obesity,
p151
aVaccess to parks, gun violence.
p152
aa(lp153
VThe important thing is, we put in place a system
p154
aVthat worked,
p155
aVand it's an approach that I call an upstream approach.
p156
aVIt's a term many of you are familiar with.
p157
aVIt comes from a parable that's very common
p158
aVin the public health community.
p159
aVThis is a parable of three friends.
p160
aVImagine that you're one of these three friends
p161
aVwho come to a river.
p162
aVIt's a beautiful scene, but it's shattered by the cries of a child,
p163
aVand actually several children, in need of rescue in the water.
p164
aVSo you do hopefully what everybody would do.
p165
aVYou jump right in along with your friends.
p166
aVThe first friend says, I'm going to rescue those
p167
aVwho are about to drown,
p168
aVthose at most risk of falling over the waterfall.
p169
aVThe second friends says, I'm going to build a raft.
p170
aVI'm going to make sure that fewer people
p171
aVneed to end up at the waterfall's edge.
p172
aVLet's usher more people to safety
p173
aVby building this raft,
p174
aVcoordinating those branches together.
p175
aVOver time, they're successful, but not really,
p176
aVas much as they want to be.
p177
aVMore people slip through, and they finally look up
p178
aVand they see that their third friend
p179
aVis nowhere to be seen.
p180
aVThey finally spot her.
p181
aVShe's in the water. She's swimming away from them
p182
aVupstream, rescuing children as she goes,
p183
aVand they shout to her, "Where are you going?
p184
aVThere are children here to save."
p185
aVAnd she says back,
p186
aV"I'm going to find out
p187
aVwho or what is throwing these children in the water."
p188
aVIn healthcare, we have that first friend \u2014
p189
aVwe have the specialist,
p190
aVwe have the trauma surgeon, the ICU nurse,
p191
aVthe E.R. doctors.
p192
aVWe have those people that are vital rescuers,
p193
aVpeople you want to be there when you're in dire straits.
p194
aVWe also know that we have the second friend \u2014
p195
aVwe have that raft-builder.
p196
aVThat's the primary care clinician,
p197
aVpeople on the care team who are there
p198
aVto manage your chronic conditions,
p199
aVyour diabetes, your hypertension,
p200
aVthere to give you your annual checkups,
p201
aVthere to make sure your vaccines are up to date,
p202
aVbut also there to make sure that you have
p203
aVa raft to sit on and usher yourself to safety.
p204
aVBut while that's also vital and very necessary,
p205
aVwhat we're missing is that third friend.
p206
aVWe don't have enough of that upstreamist.
p207
aVThe upstreamists are the health care professionals
p208
aVwho know that health does begin
p209
aVwhere we live and work and play,
p210
aVbut beyond that awareness, is able to mobilize
p211
aVthe resources to create the system
p212
aVin their clinics and in their hospitals
p213
aVthat really does start to approach that,
p214
aVto connect people to the resources they need
p215
aVoutside the four walls of the clinic.
p216
aa(lp217
VNow you might ask, and it's  a very obvious question
p218
aVthat a lot of colleagues in medicine ask:
p219
aV"Doctors and nurses thinking about transportation and housing?
p220
aVShouldn't we just provide pills and procedures
p221
aVand just make sure we focus on the task at hand?"
p222
aVCertainly, rescuing people at the water's edge
p223
aVis important enough work.
p224
aVWho has the time?
p225
aVI would argue, though, that if we were to use science as our guide,
p226
aVthat we would find an upstream approach is absolutely necessary.
p227
aVScientists now know that
p228
aVthe living and working conditions that we all
p229
aVare part of
p230
aVhave more than twice the impact on our health
p231
aVthan does our genetic code,
p232
aVand living and working conditions,
p233
aVthe structures of our environments,
p234
aVthe ways in which our social fabric is woven together,
p235
aVand the impact those have on our behaviors,
p236
aVall together, those have more than five times
p237
aVthe impact on our health
p238
aVthan do all the pills and procedures
p239
aVadministered by doctors and hospitals combined.
p240
aVAll together, living and working conditions
p241
aVaccount for 60 percent of preventable death.
p242
aa(lp243
VLet me give you an example of what this feels like.
p244
aVLet's say there was a company, a tech startup
p245
aVthat came to you and said, "We have a great product.
p246
aVIt's going to lower your risk of death from heart disease."
p247
aVNow, you might be likely to invest
p248
aVif that product was a drug or a device,
p249
aVbut what if that product was a park?
p250
aVA study in the U.K.,
p251
aVa landmark study that reviewed the records
p252
aVof over 40 million residents in the U.K.,
p253
aVlooked at several variables,
p254
aVcontrolled for a lot of factors, and found that
p255
aVwhen trying to adjust the risk of heart disease,
p256
aVone's exposure to green space was a powerful influence.
p257
aVThe closer you were to green space,
p258
aVto parks and trees,
p259
aVthe lower your chance of heart disease,
p260
aVand that stayed true for rich and for poor.
p261
aVThat study illustrates what my friends in public health
p262
aVoften say these days:
p263
aVthat one's zip code matters more
p264
aVthan your genetic code.
p265
aVWe're also learning that zip code
p266
aVis actually shaping our genetic code.
p267
aVThe science of epigenetics looks at those molecular mechanisms,
p268
aVthose intricate ways in which our DNA is literally shaped,
p269
aVgenes turned on and off
p270
aVbased on the exposures to the environment,
p271
aVto where we live and to where we work.
p272
aVSo it's clear that these factors,
p273
aVthese upstream issues, do matter.
p274
aVThey matter to our health,
p275
aVand therefore our healthcare professionals should do something about it.
p276
aVAnd yet, Veronica asked me
p277
aVperhaps the most compelling question
p278
aVI've been asked in a long time.
p279
aVIn that follow-up visit, she said,
p280
aV"Why did none of my doctors
p281
aVask about my home before?
p282
aVIn those visits to the emergency room,
p283
aVI had two CAT scans,
p284
aVI had a needle placed in the lower part of my back
p285
aVto collect spinal fluid,
p286
aVI had nearly a dozen blood tests.
p287
aVI went back and forth, I saw all sorts of people in healthcare,
p288
aVand no one asked about my home."
p289
aa(lp290
VThe honest answer is that in healthcare,
p291
aVwe often treat symptoms without addressing
p292
aVthe conditions that make you sick in the first place.
p293
aVAnd there are many reasons for that, but the big three
p294
aVare first, we don't pay for that.
p295
aVIn healthcare, we often pay  for volume and not value.
p296
aVWe pay doctors and hospitals usually
p297
aVfor the number of services they provide,
p298
aVbut not necessarily on how healthy they make you.
p299
aVThat leads to a second phenomenon that I call
p300
aVthe "don't ask, don't tell" approach
p301
aVto upstream issues in healthcare.
p302
aVWe don't ask about where you live and where you work,
p303
aVbecause if there's a problem there,
p304
aVwe don't know what to tell you.
p305
aVIt's not that doctors don't know these are important issues.
p306
aVIn a recent survey done in the U.S. among physicians,
p307
aVover 1,000 physicians,
p308
aV80 percent of them actually said that
p309
aVthey know that their patients' upstream problems
p310
aVare as important as their health issues,
p311
aVas their medical problems,
p312
aVand yet despite that widespread awareness
p313
aVof the importance of upstream issues,
p314
aVonly one in five doctors said they had
p315
aVany sense of confidence to address those issues,
p316
aVto improve health where it begins.
p317
aVThere's this gap between knowing
p318
aVthat patients' lives, the context of where they live and work,
p319
aVmatters, and the ability to do something about it
p320
aVin the systems in which we work.
p321
aa(lp322
VThis is a huge problem right now,
p323
aVbecause it leads them to this next question, which is,
p324
aVwhose responsibility is it?
p325
aVAnd that brings me to that third point,
p326
aVthat third answer to Veronica's compelling question.
p327
aVPart of the reason that we have this conundrum
p328
aVis because there are not nearly enough upstreamists
p329
aVin the healthcare system.
p330
aVThere are not nearly enough of that third friend,
p331
aVthat person who is going to find out
p332
aVwho or what is throwing those kids in the water.
p333
aVNow, there are many upstreamists,
p334
aVand I've had the privilege of meeting many of them,
p335
aVin Los Angeles and in other parts of the country
p336
aVand around the world,
p337
aVand it's important to note that upstreamists
p338
aVsometimes are doctors, but they need not be.
p339
aVThey can be nurses, other clinicians,
p340
aVcare managers, social workers.
p341
aVIt's not so important what specific degree
p342
aVupstreamists have at the end of their name.
p343
aVWhat's more important is that they all seem
p344
aVto share the same ability to implement a process
p345
aVthat transforms their assistance,
p346
aVtransforms the way they practice medicine.
p347
aVThat process is a quite simple process.
p348
aVIt's one, two and three.
p349
aVFirst, they sit down and they say,
p350
aVlet's identify the clinical problem
p351
aVamong a certain set of patients.
p352
aVLet's say, for instance,
p353
aVlet's try to help children
p354
aVwho are bouncing in and out of the hospital
p355
aVwith asthma.
p356
aVAfter identifying the problem, they  then move on to that second step,
p357
aVand they say, let's identify the root cause.
p358
aVNow, a root cause analysis, in healthcare,
p359
aVusually says, well, let's look at your genes,
p360
aVlet's look at how you're behaving.
p361
aVMaybe you're not eating healthy enough.
p362
aVEat healthier.
p363
aVIt's a pretty simplistic
p364
aVapproach to root cause analyses.
p365
aVIt turns out, it doesn't really work
p366
aVwhen we just limit ourselves that worldview.
p367
aVThe root cause analysis that an upstreamist brings
p368
aVto the table is to say, let's look at the living
p369
aVand the working conditions in your life.
p370
aVPerhaps, for children with asthma,
p371
aVit's what's happening in their home,
p372
aVor perhaps they live close to a freeway with major air pollution
p373
aVthat triggers their asthma.
p374
aVAnd perhaps that's what we should mobilize our resources to address,
p375
aVbecause that third element, that third part of the process,
p376
aVis that next critical part of what upstreamists do.
p377
aVThey mobilize the resources to create a solution,
p378
aVboth within the clinical system,
p379
aVand then by bringing in people from public health,
p380
aVfrom other sectors, lawyers,
p381
aVwhoever is willing to play ball,
p382
aVlet's bring in to create a solution that makes sense,
p383
aVto take those patients who actually have clinical problems
p384
aVand address their root causes together
p385
aVby linking them to the resources you need.
p386
aVIt's clear to me that there are so many stories
p387
aVof upstreamists who are doing remarkable things.
p388
aVThe problem is that there's just not nearly enough of them out there.
p389
aVBy some estimates, we need one upstreamist
p390
aVfor every 20 to 30 clinicians in the healthcare system.
p391
aVIn the U.S., for instance, that would mean
p392
aVthat we need 25,000 upstreamists
p393
aVby the year 2020.
p394
aVBut we only have a few thousand upstreamists out there right now, by all accounts,
p395
aVand that's why, a few years ago, my colleagues and I
p396
aVsaid, you know what, we need to train
p397
aVand make more upstreamists.
p398
aa(lp399
VSo we decided to start an organization
p400
aVcalled Health Begins,
p401
aVand Health Begins simply does that:
p402
aVWe train upstreamists.
p403
aVAnd there are a lot of measures that we use for our success,
p404
aVbut the main thing that we're interested in
p405
aVis making sure that we're changing
p406
aVthe sense of confidence,
p407
aVthat "don't ask, don't tell" metric among clinicians.
p408
aVWe're trying to make sure that clinicians,
p409
aVand therefore their systems that they work in
p410
aVhave the ability, the confidence
p411
aVto address the problems in the living
p412
aVand working conditions in our lives.
p413
aVWe're seeing nearly a tripling
p414
aVof that confidence in our work.
p415
aa(lp416
VIt's remarkable,
p417
aVbut I'll tell you the most compelling part
p418
aVof what it means to be working
p419
aVwith upstreamists to gather them together.
p420
aVWhat is most compelling is that every day,
p421
aVevery week, I hear stories just like Veronica's.
p422
aVThere are stories out there of Veronica
p423
aVand many more like her,
p424
aVpeople who are coming to the healthcare system
p425
aVand getting a glimpse of what it feels like
p426
aVto be part of something that works,
p427
aVa health care system that stops bouncing you back and forth
p428
aVbut actually improves your health,
p429
aVlistens to you who you are,
p430
aVaddresses the context of your life,
p431
aVwhether you're rich or poor or middle class.
p432
aa(lp433
VThese stories are compelling because
p434
aVnot only do they tell us that we're this close
p435
aVto getting the healthcare system that we want,
p436
aVbut that there's something that we can all do to get there.
p437
aVDoctors and nurses can get better at asking
p438
aVabout the context of patients' lives,
p439
aVnot simply because it's better bedside manner,
p440
aVbut frankly, because it's a better standard of care.
p441
aVHealthcare systems and payers
p442
aVcan start to bring in public health agencies
p443
aVand departments and say,
p444
aVlet's look at our data together.
p445
aVLet's see if we can discover some patterns in our data about our patients' lives
p446
aVand see if we can identify an upstream cause,
p447
aVand then, as importantly, can we align the resources
p448
aVto be able to address them?
p449
aVMedical schools, nursing schools,
p450
aVall sorts of health professional education programs
p451
aVcan help by training the next generation of upstreamists.

aVWe can also make sure that these schools
p453
aVcertify a backbone of the upstream approach,
p454
aVand that's the community health worker.
p455
aVWe need many more of them in the healthcare system
p456
aVif we're truly going to have it be effective,
p457
aVto move from a sickcare system
p458
aVto a healthcare system.
p459
aVBut finally, and perhaps most importantly,
p460
aVwhat do we do? What do we do as patients?
p461
aVWe can start by simply going to our doctors
p462
aVand our nurses, to our clinics,
p463
aVand asking, "Is there something in where I live
p464
aVand where I work that I should be aware of?"
p465
aVAre there barriers to health that I'm just not aware of,
p466
aVand more importantly, if there are barriers
p467
aVthat I'm surfacing, if I'm coming to you
p468
aVand I'm saying I think have a problem with
p469
aVmy apartment or at my workplace
p470
aVor I don't have access to transportation,
p471
aVor there's a park that's way too far,
p472
aVso sorry doctor, I can't take your advice
p473
aVto go and jog,
p474
aVif those problems exist,
p475
aVthen doctor, are you willing to listen?
p476
aVAnd what can we do together
p477
aVto improve my health where it begins?
p478
aa(lp479
VIf we're all able to do this work,
p480
aVdoctors and healthcare systems,
p481
aVpayers, and all of us together,
p482
aVwe'll realize something about health.
p483
aVHealth is not just a personal responsibility or phenomenon.
p484
aVHealth is a common good.
p485
aVIt comes from our personal investment in knowing
p486
aVthat our lives matter,
p487
aVthe context of where we live and where we work,
p488
aVeat, and sleep, matter,
p489
aVand that what we do for ourselves,
p490
aVwe also should do for those
p491
aVwhose living and working conditions
p492
aVagain, can be hard, if not harsh.
p493
aVWe can all invest in making sure that we improve
p494
aVthe allocation of resources upstream,
p495
aVbut at the same time work together
p496
aVand show that we can move healthcare
p497
aVupstream.
p498
aVWe can improve health where it begins.
