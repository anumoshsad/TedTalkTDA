VIf you had caught me straight out of college
p4
aVin the halls of the Vermont State House
p5
aVwhere I was a lobbyist in training
p6
aVand asked me what I was going to do with my life,
p7
aVI would have told you
p8
aVthat I'd just passed the Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi,
p9
aVthe Chinese equivalency exam,
p10
aVand I was going to go study law in Beijing,
p11
aVand I was going to improve U.S.-China relations
p12
aVthrough top-down policy changes
p13
aVand judicial system reforms.
p14
aV(Laughter)
p15
aV(Applause)
p16
aVI had a plan,
p17
aVand I never ever thought
p18
aVit would have anything to do
p19
aVwith the banjo.
p20
aa(lp21
VLittle did I know
p22
aVwhat a huge impact it would have on me one night
p23
aVwhen I was at a party
p24
aVand I heard a sound coming out of a record player
p25
aVin the corner of a room.
p26
aVAnd it was Doc Watson
p27
aVsinging and playing "Shady Grove."
p28
aV\u266b Shady Grove, my little love \u266b
p29
aV\u266b Shady Grove, my darlin' \u266b
p30
aV\u266b Shady Grove, my little love \u266b
p31
aV\u266b Going back to Harlan \u266b
p32
aVThat sound was just so beautiful,
p33
aVthe sound of Doc's voice
p34
aVand the rippling groove of the banjo.
p35
aVAnd after being totally and completely obsessed
p36
aVwith the mammoth richness and history
p37
aVof Chinese culture,
p38
aVit was like this total relief
p39
aVto hear something so truly American
p40
aVand so truly awesome.
p41
aVI knew I had to take a banjo with me to China.
p42
aa(lp43
VSo before going to law school in China
p44
aVI bought a banjo, I threw it in my little red truck
p45
aVand I traveled down through Appalachia
p46
aVand I learned a bunch of old American songs,
p47
aVand I ended up in Kentucky
p48
aVat the International Bluegrass Music Association Convention.
p49
aVAnd I was sitting in a hallway one night
p50
aVand a couple girls came up to me.
p51
aVAnd they said, "Hey, do you want to jam?"
p52
aVAnd I was like, "Sure."
p53
aVSo I picked up my banjo
p54
aVand I nervously played four songs that I actually knew with them.
p55
aVAnd a record executive walked up to me
p56
aVand invited me to Nashville, Tennessee to make a record.
p57
aa(lp58
V(Laughter)
p59
aa(lp60
VIt's been eight years,
p61
aVand I can tell you that I didn't go to China to become a lawyer.
p62
aVIn fact, I went to Nashville.
p63
aVAnd after a few months I was writing songs.
p64
aVAnd the first song I wrote was in English,
p65
aVand the second one was in Chinese.
p66
aa(lp67
V(Music)
p68
aa(lp69
V[Chinese]
p70
aa(lp71
VOutside your door the world is waiting.
p72
aVInside your heart a voice is calling.
p73
aVThe four corners of the world are watching,
p74
aVso travel daughter, travel.
p75
aVGo get it, girl.
p76
aa(lp77
V(Applause)
p78
aa(lp79
VIt's really been eight years since that fated night in Kentucky.
p80
aVAnd I've played thousands of shows.
p81
aVAnd I've collaborated
p82
aVwith so many incredible, inspirational musicians around the world.
p83
aVAnd I see the power of music.
p84
aVI see the power of music
p85
aVto connect cultures.
p86
aVI see it when I stand on a stage
p87
aVin a bluegrass festival in east Virginia
p88
aVand I look out at the sea of lawn chairs
p89
aVand I bust out into a song in Chinese.
p90
aV[Chinese]
p91
aVAnd everybody's eyes just pop wide open
p92
aVlike it's going to fall out of their heads.
p93
aVAnd they're like, "What's that girl doing?"
p94
aVAnd then they come up to me after the show
p95
aVand they all have a story.
p96
aVThey all come up and they're like,
p97
aV"You know, my aunt's sister's babysitter's dog's chicken went to China
p98
aVand adopted a girl."
p99
aVAnd I tell you what, it like everybody's got a story.
p100
aVIt's just incredible.
p101
aVAnd then I go to China
p102
aVand I stand on a stage at a university
p103
aVand I bust out into a song in Chinese
p104
aVand everybody sings along
p105
aVand they roar with delight
p106
aVat this girl
p107
aVwith the hair and the instrument,
p108
aVand she's singing their music.
p109
aa(lp110
VAnd I see, even more importantly,
p111
aVthe power of music to connect hearts.
p112
aVLike the time I was in Sichuan Province
p113
aVand I was singing for kids in relocation schools
p114
aVin the earthquake disaster zone.
p115
aVAnd this little girl comes up to me.
p116
aV[Chinese]
p117
aV"Big sister Wong,"
p118
aVWashburn, Wong, same difference.
p119
aV"Big sister Wong, can I sing you a song
p120
aVthat my mom sang for me
p121
aVbefore she was swallowed in the earthquake?"
p122
aVAnd I sat down,
p123
aVshe sat on my lap.
p124
aVShe started singing her song.
p125
aVAnd the warmth of her body
p126
aVand the tears rolling down her rosy cheeks,
p127
aVand I started to cry.
p128
aVAnd the light that shone off of her eyes
p129
aVwas a place I could have stayed forever.
p130
aa(lp131
VAnd in that moment, we weren't our American selves,
p132
aVwe weren't our Chinese selves,
p133
aVwe were just mortals
p134
aVsitting together in that light that keeps us here.
p135
aVI want to dwell in that light
p136
aVwith you and with everyone.
p137
aVAnd I know U.S.-China relations
p138
aVdoesn't need another lawyer.
p139
aa(lp140
VThank you.
