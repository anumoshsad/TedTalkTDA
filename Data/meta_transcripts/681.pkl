VA few years ago, my eyes were opened
p4
aVto the dark side of the construction industry.
p5
aVIn 2006, young Qatari students
p6
aVtook me to go and see the migrant worker camps.
p7
aVAnd since then I've followed the unfolding issue of worker rights.
p8
aa(lp9
VIn the last six months, more than 300 skyscrapers
p10
aVin the UAE have been put on hold or canceled.
p11
aVBehind the headlines that lay behind these buildings
p12
aVis the fate of the often-indentured construction worker.
p13
aV1.1 million of them.
p14
aVMainly Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan
p15
aVand Nepalese, these laborers risk everything
p16
aVto make money for their families back home.
p17
aVThey pay a middle-man thousands of dollars to be there.
p18
aVAnd when they arrive, they find themselves in labor camps with no water,
p19
aVno air conditioning, and their passports taken away.
p20
aa(lp21
VWhile it's easy to point the finger at local officials and higher authorities,
p22
aV99 percent of these people are hired by the private sector,
p23
aVand so therefore we're equally, if not more, accountable.
p24
aVGroups like Buildsafe UAE have emerged,
p25
aVbut the numbers are simply overwhelming.
p26
aVIn August 2008,
p27
aVUAE public officials noted
p28
aVthat 40 percent of the country's 1,098 labor camps
p29
aVhad violated minimum health and fire safety regulations.
p30
aVAnd last summer, more than 10,000 workers
p31
aVprotested for the non-payment of wages,
p32
aVfor the poor quality of food, and inadequate housing.
p33
aa(lp34
VAnd then the financial collapse happened.
p35
aVWhen the contractors have gone bust,
p36
aVas they've been overleveraged like everyone else,
p37
aVthe difference is everything goes missing,
p38
aVdocumentation, passports,
p39
aVand tickets home for these workers.
p40
aVCurrently, right now, thousands of workers are abandoned.
p41
aVThere is no way back home.
p42
aVAnd there is no way, and no proof of arrival.
p43
aVThese are the boom-and-bust refugees.
p44
aa(lp45
VThe question is, as a building professional,
p46
aVas an architect, an engineer, as a developer,
p47
aVif you know this is going on,
p48
aVas we go to the sights every single week,
p49
aVare you complacent or complicit
p50
aVin the human rights violations?
p51
aVSo let's forget your environmental footprint.
p52
aVLet's think about your ethical footprint.
p53
aVWhat good is it
p54
aVto build a zero-carbon, energy efficient complex,
p55
aVwhen the labor producing this architectural gem
p56
aVis unethical at best?
p57
aVNow, recently I've been told I've been taking the high road.
p58
aVBut, quite frankly, on this issue,
p59
aVthere is no other road.
p60
aa(lp61
VSo let's not forget who is really paying the price of this financial collapse.
p62
aVAnd that as we worry about our next job in the office,
p63
aVthe next design that we can get, to keep our workers.
p64
aVLet's not forget these men, who are truly dying to work.
p65
aVThank you.
