VWhen I was little, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
p4
aVAnd I grew up singing a song called "Nothing To Envy."
p5
aVAnd I was very proud.
p6
aVIn school, we spent a lot of time studying the history of Kim Il-Sung,
p7
aVbut we never learned much about the outside world,
p8
aVexcept that America, South Korea, Japan are the enemies.
p9
aVAlthough I often wondered about the outside world,
p10
aVI thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea,
p11
aVuntil everything suddenly changed.
p12
aa(lp13
VWhen I was seven years old, I saw my first public execution.
p14
aVBut I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
p15
aVMy family was not poor,
p16
aVand myself, I had never experienced hunger.
p17
aa(lp18
VBut one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter
p19
aVfrom a coworker's sister.
p20
aVIt read, "When you read this,
p21
aVour five family members will not exist in this world,
p22
aVbecause we haven't eaten for the past three weeks.
p23
aVWe are lying on the floor together,
p24
aVand our bodies are so weak, we are waiting to die."
p25
aa(lp26
VI was so shocked.
p27
aVThis was the first time I heard that people in my country were suffering.
p28
aVSoon after, when I was walking past a train station,
p29
aVI saw something terrible that to this day I can't erase from my memory.
p30
aVA lifeless woman was lying on the ground,
p31
aVwhile an emaciated child in her arms
p32
aVjust stared helplessly at his mother's face.
p33
aVBut nobody helped them,
p34
aVbecause they were so focused on taking care of themselves and their families.
p35
aa(lp36
VA huge famine hit North Korea in the mid-1990s.
p37
aVUltimately, more than a million North Koreans died during the famine,
p38
aVand many only survived by eating grass, bugs and tree bark.
p39
aVPower outages also became more and more frequent,
p40
aVso everything around me was completely dark at night,
p41
aVexcept for the sea of lights in China,
p42
aVjust across the river from my home.
p43
aVI always wondered why they had lights, but we didn't.
p44
aVThis is a satellite picture showing North Korea at night,
p45
aVcompared to neighbors.
p46
aa(lp47
VThis is the Amnok River,
p48
aVwhich serves as a part of the border between North Korea and China.
p49
aVAs you can see, the river can be very narrow at certain points,
p50
aVallowing North Koreans to secretly cross.
p51
aVBut many die.
p52
aVSometimes, I saw dead bodies floating down the river.
p53
aVI can't reveal many details about how I left North Korea,
p54
aVbut I only can say that during the ugly years of the famine,
p55
aVI was sent to China to live with distant relatives.
p56
aVBut I only thought that I would be separated from my family
p57
aVfor a short time.
p58
aVI could have never imagined
p59
aVthat it would take 14 years to live together.
p60
aa(lp61
VIn China, it was hard living as a young girl without my family.
p62
aVI had no idea what life was going to be like
p63
aVas a North Korean refugee.
p64
aVBut I soon learned it's not only extremely difficult,
p65
aVit's also very dangerous,
p66
aVsince North Korean refugees are considered in China as illegal migrants.
p67
aVSo I was living in constant fear that my identity could be revealed,
p68
aVand I would be repatriated to a horrible fate,
p69
aVback in North Korea.
p70
aa(lp71
VOne day, my worst nightmare came true,
p72
aVwhen I was caught by the Chinese police,
p73
aVand brought to the police station for interrogation.
p74
aVSomeone had accused me of being North Korean,
p75
aVso they tested my Chinese language abilities,
p76
aVand asked me tons of questions.
p77
aVI was so scared.
p78
aVI thought my heart was going to explode.
p79
aVIf anything seemed unnatural, I could be imprisoned and repatriated.
p80
aVI thought my life was over.
p81
aVBut I managed to control all the emotions inside me,
p82
aVand answer the questions.
p83
aVAfter they finished questioning me,
p84
aVone official said to another,
p85
aV"This was a false report. She's not North Korean."
p86
aVAnd they let me go. It was a miracle.
p87
aa(lp88
VSome North Koreans in China seek asylum in foreign embassies.
p89
aVBut many can be caught by the Chinese police,
p90
aVand repatriated.
p91
aVThese girls were so lucky.
p92
aVEven though they were caught,
p93
aVthey were eventually released, after heavy international pressure.
p94
aVThese North Koreans were not so lucky.
p95
aVEvery year, countless North Koreans are caught in China
p96
aVand repatriated to North Korea,
p97
aVwhere they can be tortured, imprisoned, or publicly executed.
p98
aa(lp99
VEven though I was really fortunate to get out,
p100
aVmany other North Koreans have not been so lucky.
p101
aVIt's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities
p102
aVand struggle so hard just to survive.
p103
aVEven after learning a new language and getting a job,
p104
aVtheir whole world can be turned upside down in an instant.
p105
aVThat's why, after 10 years of hiding my identity,
p106
aVI decided to risk going to South Korea.
p107
aVAnd I started a new life yet again.
p108
aa(lp109
VSettling down in South Korea
p110
aVwas a lot more challenging than I had expected.
p111
aVEnglish was so important in South Korea,
p112
aVso I had to start learning my third language.
p113
aVAlso, I realized there was a wide gap between North and South.
p114
aVWe are all Korean, but inside,
p115
aVwe have become very different, due to 67 years of division.
p116
aVI even went through an identity crisis.
p117
aVAm I South Korean or North Korean?
p118
aVWhere am I from? Who am I?
p119
aVSuddenly, there was no country I could proudly call my own.
p120
aa(lp121
VEven though adjusting to life in South Korea was not easy,
p122
aVI made a plan \u2014 I started studying for the university entrance exam.
p123
aa(lp124
VJust as I was starting to get used to my new life,
p125
aVI received a shocking phone call.
p126
aVThe North Korean authorities intercepted some money
p127
aVthat I sent to my family,
p128
aVand, as a punishment, my family was going to be forcibly removed
p129
aVto a desolate location in the countryside.
p130
aVThey had to get out quickly.
p131
aVSo I started planning how to help them escape.
p132
aa(lp133
VNorth Koreans have to travel incredible distances
p134
aVon the path to freedom.
p135
aVIt's almost impossible to cross the border
p136
aVbetween North Korea and South Korea.
p137
aVSo, ironically, I took a flight back to China
p138
aVand headed toward the North Korean border.
p139
aVSince my family couldn't speak Chinese,
p140
aVI had to guide them somehow through more than 2,000 miles
p141
aVin China, and then into Southeast Asia.
p142
aVThe journey by bus took one week,
p143
aVand we were almost caught several times.
p144
aVOne time, our bus was stopped and boarded by a Chinese police officer.
p145
aVHe took everyone's I.D. cards,
p146
aVand he started asking them questions.
p147
aVSince my family couldn't understand Chinese,
p148
aVI thought my family was going to be arrested.
p149
aVAs the Chinese officer approached my family,
p150
aVI impulsively stood up, and I told him
p151
aVthat these are deaf and dumb people that I was chaperoning.
p152
aVHe looked at me suspiciously,
p153
aVbut luckily, he believed me.
p154
aa(lp155
VWe made it all the way to the border of Laos.
p156
aVBut I had to spend almost all my money
p157
aVto bribe the border guards in Laos.
p158
aVBut even after we got past the border,
p159
aVmy family was arrested and jailed for illegal border crossing.
p160
aVAfter I paid the fine and bribe,
p161
aVmy family was released in one month.
p162
aVBut soon after, my family was arrested and jailed again,
p163
aVin the capital of Laos.
p164
aa(lp165
VThis was one of the lowest points in my life.
p166
aVI did everything to get my family to freedom,
p167
aVand we came so close,
p168
aVbut my family was thrown in jail,
p169
aVjust a short distance from the South Korean embassy.
p170
aVI went back and forth between the immigration office
p171
aVand the police station,
p172
aVdesperately trying to get my family out.
p173
aVbut I didn't have enough money to pay a bribe or fine anymore.
p174
aVI lost all hope.
p175
aa(lp176
VAt that moment, I heard one man's voice ask me,
p177
aV"What's wrong?"
p178
aVI was so surprised that a total stranger cared enough to ask.
p179
aVIn my broken English, and with a dictionary,
p180
aVI explained the situation, and without hesitating,
p181
aVthe man went to the ATM,
p182
aVand he paid the rest of the money for my family,
p183
aVand two other North Koreans to get out of jail.
p184
aa(lp185
VI thanked him with all my heart, and I asked him,
p186
aV"Why are you helping me?"
p187
aa(lp188
V"I'm not helping you," he said.
p189
aV"I'm helping the North Korean people."
p190
aa(lp191
VI realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
p192
aVThe kind stranger symbolized new hope for me and the North Korean people,
p193
aVwhen we needed it most.
p194
aVAnd he showed me that the kindness of strangers
p195
aVand the support of the international community
p196
aVare truly the rays of hope we North Korean people need.
p197
aa(lp198
VEventually, after our long journey,
p199
aVmy family and I were reunited in South Korea.
p200
aVBut getting to freedom is only half the battle.
p201
aVMany North Koreans are separated from their families,
p202
aVand when they arrive in a new country,
p203
aVthey start with little or no money.
p204
aVSo we can benefit from the international community
p205
aVfor education, English language training, job training, and more.
p206
aVWe can also act as a bridge
p207
aVbetween the people inside North Korea and the outside world.
p208
aVBecause many of us stay in contact with family members still inside,
p209
aVand we send information and money
p210
aVthat is helping to change North Korea from inside.
p211
aa(lp212
VI've been so lucky, received so much help and inspiration in my life,
p213
aVso I want to help give aspiring North Koreans
p214
aVa chance to prosper with international support.
p215
aVI'm confident that you will see more and more North Koreans
p216
aVsucceeding all over the world,
p217
aVincluding the TED stage.
p218
aa(lp219
VThank you.
