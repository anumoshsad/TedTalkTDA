VI'm very pleased to be here today
p4
aVto talk to you all about how we might repair
p5
aVthe damaged brain,
p6
aVand I'm particularly excited by this field,
p7
aVbecause as a neurologist myself,
p8
aVI believe that this offers one of the great ways
p9
aVthat we might be able to offer hope
p10
aVfor patients who today live with devastating
p11
aVand yet untreatable diseases of the brain.
p12
aa(lp13
VSo here's the problem.
p14
aVYou can see here the picture of somebody's brain
p15
aVwith Alzheimer's disease
p16
aVnext to a healthy brain,
p17
aVand what's obvious is, in the Alzheimer's brain,
p18
aVringed red, there's obvious damage \u2014 atrophy, scarring.
p19
aVAnd I could show you equivalent pictures
p20
aVfrom other disease: multiple sclerosis,
p21
aVmotor neuron disease, Parkinson's disease,
p22
aVeven Huntington's disease,
p23
aVand they would all tell a similar story.
p24
aVAnd collectively these brain disorders represent
p25
aVone of the major public health threats of our time.
p26
aVAnd the numbers here are really rather staggering.
p27
aVAt any one time, there are 35 million people today
p28
aVliving with one of these brain diseases,
p29
aVand the annual cost globally
p30
aVis 700 billion dollars.
p31
aVI mean, just think about that.
p32
aVThat's greater than one percent
p33
aVof the global GDP.
p34
aVAnd it gets worse,
p35
aVbecause all these numbers are rising
p36
aVbecause these are by and large
p37
aVage-related diseases, and we're living longer.
p38
aVSo the question we really need to ask ourselves is,
p39
aVwhy, given the devastating impact of these diseases
p40
aVto the individual,
p41
aVnever mind the scale of the societal problem,
p42
aVwhy are there no effective treatments?
p43
aa(lp44
VNow in order to consider this,
p45
aVI first need to give you a crash course
p46
aVin how the brain works.
p47
aVSo in other words, I need to tell you
p48
aVeverything I learned at medical school.
p49
aV(Laughter)
p50
aVBut believe me, this isn't going to take very long.
p51
aVOkay? (Laughter)
p52
aVSo the brain is terribly simple:
p53
aVit's made up of four cells,
p54
aVand two of them are shown here.
p55
aVThere's the nerve cell,
p56
aVand then there's the myelinating cell,
p57
aVor the insulating cell.
p58
aVIt's called oligodendrocyte.
p59
aVAnd when these four cells work together
p60
aVin health and harmony,
p61
aVthey create an extraordinary symphony of electrical activity,
p62
aVand it is this electrical activity
p63
aVthat underpins our ability to think, to emote,
p64
aVto remember, to learn, move, feel and so on.
p65
aVBut equally, each of these individual four cells
p66
aValone or together, can go rogue or die,
p67
aVand when that happens, you get damage.
p68
aVYou get damaged wiring.
p69
aVYou get disrupted connections.
p70
aVAnd that's evident here with the slower conduction.
p71
aVBut ultimately, this damage will manifest
p72
aVas disease, clearly.
p73
aVAnd if the starting dying nerve cell
p74
aVis a motor nerve, for example,
p75
aVyou'll get motor neuron disease.
p76
aa(lp77
VSo I'd like to give you a real-life illustration
p78
aVof what happens with motor neuron disease.
p79
aVSo this is a patient of mine called John.
p80
aVJohn I saw just last week in the clinic.
p81
aVAnd I've asked John to tell us something  about what were his problems
p82
aVthat led to the initial diagnosis
p83
aVof motor neuron disease.
p84
aa(lp85
VJohn: I was diagnosed in October in 2011,
p86
aVand the main problem was a breathing problem,
p87
aVdifficulty breathing.
p88
aa(lp89
VSiddharthan Chandran: I don't know if you caught all of that, but what John was telling us
p90
aVwas that difficulty with breathing
p91
aVled eventually to the diagnosis
p92
aVof motor neuron disease.
p93
aa(lp94
VSo John's now 18 months further down in that journey,
p95
aVand I've now asked him to tell us something about
p96
aVhis current predicament.
p97
aa(lp98
VJohn: What I've got now is  the breathing's gotten worse.
p99
aVI've got weakness in my hands,  my arms and my legs.
p100
aVSo basically I'm in a wheelchair most of the time.
p101
aa(lp102
VSC: John's just told us he's in a wheelchair
p103
aVmost of the time.
p104
aa(lp105
VSo what these two clips show
p106
aVis not just the devastating consequence of the disease,
p107
aVbut they also tell us something about
p108
aVthe shocking pace of the disease,
p109
aVbecause in just 18 months,
p110
aVa fit adult man has been rendered
p111
aVwheelchair- and respirator-dependent.
p112
aVAnd let's face it, John could be anybody's father,
p113
aVbrother or friend.
p114
aa(lp115
VSo that's what happens when the motor nerve dies.
p116
aVBut what happens when that myelin cell dies?
p117
aVYou get multiple sclerosis.
p118
aVSo the scan on your left
p119
aVis an illustration of the brain,
p120
aVand it's a map of the connections of the brain,
p121
aVand superimposed upon which
p122
aVare areas of damage.
p123
aVWe call them lesions of demyelination.
p124
aVBut they're damage, and they're white.
p125
aa(lp126
VSo I know what you're thinking here.
p127
aVYou're thinking, "My God, this bloke came up
p128
aVand said he's going to talk about hope,
p129
aVand all he's done is give a really rather bleak
p130
aVand depressing tale."
p131
aVI've told you these diseases are terrible.
p132
aVThey're devastating, numbers are rising,
p133
aVthe costs are ridiculous, and worst of all,
p134
aVwe have no treatment. Where's the hope?
p135
aa(lp136
VWell, you know what? I think there is hope.
p137
aVAnd there's hope in this next section,
p138
aVof this brain section of somebody else with M.S.,
p139
aVbecause what it illustrates
p140
aVis, amazingly, the brain can repair itself.
p141
aVIt just doesn't do it well enough.
p142
aVAnd so again, there are two things I want to show you.
p143
aVFirst of all is the damage of this patient with M.S.
p144
aVAnd again, it's another one of these white masses.
p145
aVBut crucially, the area that's ringed red
p146
aVhighlights an area that is pale blue.
p147
aVBut that area that is pale blue was once white.
p148
aVSo it was damaged. It's now repaired.
p149
aVJust to be clear: It's not because of doctors.
p150
aVIt's in spite of doctors, not because of doctors.
p151
aVThis is spontaneous repair.
p152
aVIt's amazing and it's occurred
p153
aVbecause there are stem cells in the brain, even,
p154
aVwhich can enable new myelin, new insulation,
p155
aVto be laid down over the damaged nerves.
p156
aVAnd this observation is important for two reasons.
p157
aVThe first is it challenges one of the orthodoxies
p158
aVthat we learnt at medical school,
p159
aVor at least I did, admittedly last century,
p160
aVwhich is that the brain doesn't repair itself,
p161
aVunlike, say, the bone or the liver.
p162
aVBut actually it does, but it just doesn't do it well enough.
p163
aVAnd the second thing it does,
p164
aVand it gives us a very clear direction  of travel for new therapies \u2014
p165
aVI mean, you don't need to be a rocket scientist
p166
aVto know what to do here.
p167
aVYou simply need to find ways of promoting
p168
aVthe endogenous, spontaneous repair that occurs anyway.
p169
aa(lp170
VSo the question is, why, if we've known that
p171
aVfor some time, as we have,
p172
aVwhy do we not have those treatments?
p173
aVAnd that in part reflects the complexity
p174
aVof drug development.
p175
aVNow, drug development you might think of
p176
aVas a rather expensive but risky bet,
p177
aVand the odds of this bet are roughly this:
p178
aVthey're 10,000 to one against,
p179
aVbecause you need to screen about 10,000 compounds
p180
aVto find that one potential winner.
p181
aVAnd then you need to spend 15 years
p182
aVand spend over a billion dollars,
p183
aVand even then, you may not have a winner.
p184
aa(lp185
VSo the question for us is,
p186
aVcan you change the rules of the game
p187
aVand can you shorten the odds?
p188
aVAnd in order to do that, you have to think,
p189
aVwhere is the bottleneck in this drug discovery?
p190
aVAnd one of the bottlenecks is  early in drug discovery.
p191
aVAll that screening occurs in animal models.
p192
aVBut we know that the proper  study of mankind is man,
p193
aVto borrow from Alexander Pope.
p194
aVSo the question is, can we study these diseases
p195
aVusing human material?
p196
aVAnd of course, absolutely we can.
p197
aVWe can use stem cells,
p198
aVand specifically we can use human stem cells.
p199
aVAnd human stem cells are these extraordinary
p200
aVbut simple cells that can do two things:
p201
aVthey can self-renew or make more of themselves,
p202
aVbut they can also become specialized
p203
aVto make bone, liver or, crucially, nerve cells,
p204
aVmaybe even the motor nerve cell
p205
aVor the myelin cell.
p206
aVAnd the challenge has long been,
p207
aVcan we harness the power,
p208
aVthe undoubted power of these stem cells
p209
aVin order to realize their promise
p210
aVfor regenerative neurology?
p211
aa(lp212
VAnd I think we can now, and the reason we can
p213
aVis because there have been several major discoveries
p214
aVin the last 10, 20 years.
p215
aVOne of them was here in Edinburgh,
p216
aVand it must be the only celebrity sheep, Dolly.
p217
aVSo Dolly was made in Edinburgh,
p218
aVand Dolly was an example
p219
aVof the first cloning of a mammal
p220
aVfrom an adult cell.
p221
aVBut I think the even more significant breakthrough
p222
aVfor the purposes of our discussion today
p223
aVwas made in 2006 by a Japanese scientist
p224
aVcalled Yamanaka.
p225
aVAnd what Yamaka did,
p226
aVin a fantastic form of scientific cookery,
p227
aVwas he showed that four ingredients,
p228
aVjust four ingredients,
p229
aVcould effectively convert any cell, adult cell,
p230
aVinto a master stem cell.
p231
aVAnd the significance of this is difficult to exaggerate,
p232
aVbecause what it means that from anybody in this room,
p233
aVbut particularly patients,
p234
aVyou could now generate
p235
aVa bespoke, personalized tissue repair kit.
p236
aVTake a skin cell, make it a master pluripotent cell,
p237
aVso you could then make those cells
p238
aVthat are relevant to their disease,
p239
aVboth to study but potentially to treat.
p240
aVNow, the idea of that at medical school \u2014
p241
aVthis is a recurring theme, isn't  it, me and medical school? \u2014
p242
aVwould have been ridiculous,
p243
aVbut it's an absolute reality today.
p244
aVAnd I see this as the cornerstone
p245
aVof regeneration, repair and hope.
p246
aa(lp247
VAnd whilst we're on the theme of hope,
p248
aVfor those of you who might have failed at school,
p249
aVthere's hope for you as well,
p250
aVbecause this is the school report of John Gerdon.
p251
aV["I believe he has ideas about becoming a scientist; on his present showing this is quite ridiculous."]
p252
aVSo they didn't think much of him then.
p253
aVBut what you may not know is that he  got the Nobel Prize for medicine
p254
aVjust three months ago.
p255
aa(lp256
VSo to return to the original problem,
p257
aVwhat is the opportunity of these stem cells,
p258
aVor this disruptive technology,
p259
aVfor repairing the damaged brain,
p260
aVwhich we call regenerative neurology?
p261
aVI think there are two ways you can think about this:
p262
aVas a fantastic 21st-century drug discovery tool,
p263
aVand/or as a form of therapy.
p264
aVSo I want to tell you a little bit about both of those
p265
aVin the next few moments.
p266
aa(lp267
VDrug discovery in a dish is how people often
p268
aVtalk about this.
p269
aVIt's very simple: You take a patient with a disease,
p270
aVlet's say motor neuron disease,
p271
aVyou take a skin sample,
p272
aVyou do the pluripotent reprogramming,
p273
aVas I've already told you,
p274
aVand you generate live motor nerve cells.
p275
aVThat's straightforward, because that's what
p276
aVpluripotent cells can do.
p277
aVBut crucially, you can then compare their behavior
p278
aVto their equivalent but healthy counterparts,
p279
aVideally from an unaffected relative.
p280
aVThat way, you're matching for genetic variation.
p281
aa(lp282
VAnd that's exactly what we did here.
p283
aVThis was a collaboration with colleagues:
p284
aVin London, Chris Shaw; in the U.S.,  Steve Finkbeiner and Tom Maniatis.
p285
aVAnd what you're looking at, and this is amazing,
p286
aVthese are living, growing, motor nerve cells
p287
aVfrom a patient with motor neuron disease.
p288
aVIt happens to be an inherited form.
p289
aVI mean, just imagine that.
p290
aVThis would have been unimaginable 10 years ago.
p291
aVSo apart from seeing them grow and put out processes,
p292
aVwe can also engineer them so that they fluoresce,
p293
aVbut crucially, we can then track their individual health
p294
aVand compare the diseased motor nerve cells
p295
aVto the healthy ones.
p296
aVAnd when you do all that and put it together,
p297
aVyou realize that the diseased ones,
p298
aVwhich is represented in the red line,
p299
aVare two and a half times more likely to die
p300
aVthan the healthy counterpart.
p301
aVAnd the crucial point about this is that you then have
p302
aVa fantastic assay to discover drugs,
p303
aVbecause what would you ask of the drugs,
p304
aVand you could do this through a high-throughput
p305
aVautomated screening system,
p306
aVyou'd ask the drugs, give me one thing:
p307
aVfind me a drug that will bring the red line
p308
aVcloser to the blue line,
p309
aVbecause that drug will be a high-value candidate
p310
aVthat you could probably take direct to human trial
p311
aVand almost bypass that bottleneck
p312
aVthat I've told you about in drug discovery
p313
aVwith the animal models,
p314
aVif that makes sense. It's fantastic.
p315
aa(lp316
VBut I want to come back
p317
aVto how you might use stem cells directly
p318
aVto repair damage.
p319
aVAnd again there are two ways to think about this,
p320
aVand they're not mutually exclusive.
p321
aVThe first, and I think in the long run
p322
aVthe one that will give us the biggest dividend,
p323
aVbut it's not thought of that way just yet,
p324
aVis to think about those stem cells that are already
p325
aVin your brain, and I've told you that.
p326
aVAll of us have stem cells in the brain,
p327
aVeven the diseased brain,
p328
aVand surely the smart way forward
p329
aVis to find ways that you can promote and activate
p330
aVthose stem cells in your brain already
p331
aVto react and respond appropriately to damage
p332
aVto repair it.
p333
aVThat will be the future.
p334
aVThere will be drugs that will do that.
p335
aa(lp336
VBut the other way is to effectively parachute in cells,
p337
aVtransplant them in,
p338
aVto replace dying or lost cells, even in the brain.
p339
aVAnd I want to tell you now an experiment,
p340
aVit's a clinical trial that we did,
p341
aVwhich recently completed,
p342
aVwhich is with colleagues in UCL,
p343
aVDavid Miller in particular.
p344
aVSo this study was very simple.
p345
aVWe took patients with multiple sclerosis
p346
aVand asked a simple question:
p347
aVWould stem cells from the bone marrow
p348
aVbe protective of their nerves?
p349
aVSo what we did was we took this bone marrow,
p350
aVgrew up the stem cells in the lab,
p351
aVand then injected them back into the vein.
p352
aVI'm making this sound really simple.
p353
aVIt took five years off a lot of people, okay?
p354
aVAnd it put gray hair on me
p355
aVand caused all kinds of issues.
p356
aVBut conceptually, it's essentially simple.
p357
aVSo we've given them into the vein, right?
p358
aVSo in order to measure whether this was successful or not,
p359
aVwe measured the optic nerve
p360
aVas our outcome measure.
p361
aVAnd that's a good thing to measure in M.S.,
p362
aVbecause patients with M.S. sadly suffer
p363
aVwith problems with vision \u2014
p364
aVloss of vision, unclear vision.
p365
aVAnd so we measured the size of the optic nerve
p366
aVusing the scans with David Miller
p367
aVthree times \u2014 12 months, six months,
p368
aVand before the infusion \u2014
p369
aVand you can see the gently declining red line.
p370
aVAnd that's telling you that the optic nerve is shrinking,
p371
aVwhich makes sense, because their nerves are dying.
p372
aVWe then gave the stem cell infusion
p373
aVand repeated the measurement twice \u2014
p374
aVthree months and six months \u2014
p375
aVand to our surprise, almost,
p376
aVthe line's gone up.
p377
aVThat suggests that the intervention
p378
aVhas been protective.
p379
aVI don't think myself that what's happened
p380
aVis that those stem cells have made new myelin
p381
aVor new nerves.
p382
aVWhat I think they've done is they've promoted
p383
aVthe endogenous stem cells, or precursor cells,
p384
aVto do their job, wake up, lay down new myelin.
p385
aVSo this is a proof of concept.
p386
aVI'm very excited about that.
p387
aa(lp388
VSo I just want to end with the theme I began on,
p389
aVwhich was regeneration and hope.
p390
aVSo here I've asked John
p391
aVwhat his hopes are for the future.
p392
aa(lp393
VJohn: I would hope that
p394
aVsometime in the future
p395
aVthrough the research that you people are doing,
p396
aVwe can come up with a cure
p397
aVso that people like me can lead a normal life.
p398
aa(lp399
VSC: I mean, that speaks volumes.
p400
aa(lp401
VBut I'd like to close by first of all thanking John \u2014
p402
aVthanking John for allowing me to share
p403
aVhis insights and these clips with you all.
p404
aVBut I'd also like to add to John and to others
p405
aVthat my own view is, I'm hopeful for the future.
p406
aVI do believe that the disruptive technologies
p407
aVlike stem cells that I've tried to explain to you
p408
aVdo offer very real hope.
p409
aVAnd I do think that the day that we might be able
p410
aVto repair the damaged brain
p411
aVis sooner than we think.
p412
aVThank you.
