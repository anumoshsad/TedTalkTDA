VI'm just going to play a brief video clip.
p4
aa(lp5
VVideo:
p6
aVOn the fifth of December 1985, a bottle of 1787 Lafitte was sold
p7
aVfor 105,000 pounds \u2014 nine times the previous world record.
p8
aVThe buyer
p9
aVwas Kip Forbes,
p10
aVson of one of the most flamboyant millionaires of the 20th century.
p11
aVThe original owner of the bottle turned out to be
p12
aVone of the most enthusiastic wine buffs of the 18th century.
p13
aVChâteau Lafitte is one of the greatest wines in the world,
p14
aVthe prince of any wine cellar.
p15
aa(lp16
VBenjamin Wallace: Now, that's about all the videotape that remains of an event
p17
aVthat set off the longest-running mystery in the modern wine world.
p18
aVAnd the mystery existed because of a gentleman named Hardy Rodenstock.
p19
aVIn 1985, he announced to his friends in the wine world
p20
aVthat he had made this incredible discovery.
p21
aVSome workmen in Paris had broken through a brick wall,
p22
aVand happened upon this hidden cache of wines \u2014
p23
aVapparently the property of Thomas Jefferson. 1787, 1784.
p24
aVHe wouldn't reveal the exact number of bottles,
p25
aVhe would not reveal exactly where the building was
p26
aVand he would not reveal exactly who owned the building.
p27
aVThe mystery persisted for about 20 years.
p28
aa(lp29
VIt finally began to get resolved in 2005 because of this guy.
p30
aVBill Koch is a Florida billionaire who owns four of the Jefferson bottles,
p31
aVand he became suspicious.
p32
aVAnd he ended up spending over a million dollars and hiring ex-FBI
p33
aVand ex-Scotland Yard agents to try to get to the bottom of this.
p34
aVThere's now ample evidence that Hardy Rodenstock is a con man,
p35
aVand that the Jefferson bottles were fakes.
p36
aa(lp37
VBut for those 20 years,
p38
aVan unbelievable number of really eminent and accomplished figures
p39
aVin the wine world were sort of drawn into the orbit of these bottles.
p40
aVI think they wanted to believe that the most expensive bottle of wine
p41
aVin the world must be the best bottle of wine in the world,
p42
aVmust be the rarest bottle of wine in the world.
p43
aVI became increasingly, kind of voyeuristically interested in the question of
p44
aVyou know, why do people spend these crazy amounts of money,
p45
aVnot only on wine but on lots of things,
p46
aVand are they living a better life than me?
p47
aa(lp48
VSo, I decided to embark on a quest.
p49
aVWith the generous backing of a magazine I write for sometimes,
p50
aVI decided to sample the very best, or most expensive, or most coveted item
p51
aVin about a dozen categories,
p52
aVwhich was a very grueling quest,  as you can imagine.
p53
aa(lp54
V(Laughter)
p55
aa(lp56
VThis was the first one.
p57
aVA lot of the Kobe beef that you see in the U.S. is not the real thing.
p58
aVIt may come from Wagyu cattle,
p59
aVbut it's not from the original, Appalachian Hyogo Prefecture in Japan.
p60
aVThere are very few places in the U.S. where you can try real Kobe,
p61
aVand one of them is Wolfgang Puck's restaurant, Cut, in Los Angeles.
p62
aVI went there, and I ordered the eight-ounce rib eye for 160 dollars.
p63
aVAnd it arrived, and it was tiny.
p64
aVAnd I was outraged.
p65
aVIt was like, 160 dollars for this?
p66
aVAnd then I took a bite,
p67
aVand I wished that it was tinier, because Kobe beef is so rich.
p68
aVIt's like foie gras \u2014 it's not even like steak.
p69
aVI almost couldn't finish it.
p70
aVI was really happy when I was done.
p71
aa(lp72
V(Laughter)
p73
aa(lp74
VNow, the photographer who took the pictures for this project
p75
aVfor some reason posed his dog in a lot of them,
p76
aVso that's why you're going to see this recurring character.
p77
aVWhich, I guess, you know, communicates to you
p78
aVthat I did not think that one was really worth the price.
p79
aa(lp80
VWhite truffles.
p81
aVOne of the most expensive luxury foods by weight in the world.
p82
aVTo try this, I went to a Mario Batali restaurant
p83
aVin Manhattan \u2014 Del Posto.
p84
aVThe waiter, you know, came out with the white truffle knob
p85
aVand his shaver, and he shaved it onto my pasta and he said, you know,
p86
aV"Would Signore like the truffles?"
p87
aVAnd the charm of white truffles is in their aroma.
p88
aVIt's not in their taste, really. It's not in their texture.
p89
aVIt's in the smell.
p90
aVThese white pearlescent flakes hit the noodles,
p91
aVthis haunting, wonderful, nutty, mushroomy smell wafted up.
p92
aV10 seconds passed and it was gone.
p93
aVAnd then I was left with these little ugly flakes on my pasta that,
p94
aVyou know, their purpose had been served,
p95
aVand so I'm afraid to say that this was also a disappointment to me.
p96
aVThere were several \u2014 several of these items were disappointments.
p97
aa(lp98
V(Laughter)
p99
aa(lp100
VYeah.
p101
aVThe magazine wouldn't pay for me to go there.
p102
aa(lp103
V(Laughter)
p104
aa(lp105
VThey did give me a tour, though.
p106
aVAnd this hotel suite is 4,300 square feet.
p107
aVIt has 360-degree views.
p108
aVIt has four balconies.
p109
aVIt was designed by the architect I.M. Pei.
p110
aVIt comes with its own Rolls Royce and driver.
p111
aVIt comes with its own wine cellar that you can draw freely from.
p112
aVWhen I took the tour, it actually included some Opus One, I was glad to see.
p113
aV30,000 dollars for a night in a hotel.
p114
aa(lp115
VThis is soap that's made from silver nanoparticles,
p116
aVwhich have antibacterial properties.
p117
aVI washed my face with this this morning in preparation for this.
p118
aVAnd it, you know, tickled a little bit and it smelled good,
p119
aVbut I have to say that nobody here
p120
aVhas complimented me on the cleanliness of my face today.
p121
aa(lp122
V(Laughter)
p123
aa(lp124
VBut then again, nobody has complimented me on the jeans I'm wearing.
p125
aVThese ones GQ did spring for \u2014 I own these \u2014 but I will tell you,
p126
aVnot only did I not get a compliment from any of you,
p127
aVI have not gotten a compliment from anybody
p128
aVin the months that I have owned and worn these.
p129
aVI don't think that whether or not you're getting a compliment
p130
aVshould be the test of something's value,
p131
aVbut I think in the case of a fashion item, an article of clothing,
p132
aVthat's a reasonable benchmark.
p133
aVThat said, a lot of work goes into these.
p134
aVThey are made from handpicked organic Zimbabwean cotton
p135
aVthat has been shuttle loomed
p136
aVand then hand-dipped in natural indigo 24 times.
p137
aVBut no compliments.
p138
aa(lp139
V(Laughter)
p140
aa(lp141
VThank you.
p142
aa(lp143
VArmando Manni is a former filmmaker who makes this olive oil
p144
aVfrom an olive that grows on a single slope in Tuscany.
p145
aVAnd he goes to great lengths to protect the olive oil from oxygen and light.
p146
aVHe uses tiny bottles, the glass is tinted,
p147
aVhe tops the olive oil off with an inert gas.
p148
aVAnd he actually \u2014 once he releases a batch of it,
p149
aVhe regularly conducts molecular analyses and posts the results online,
p150
aVso you can go online and look at your batch number
p151
aVand see how the phenolics are developing,
p152
aVand, you know, gauge its freshness.
p153
aVI did a blind taste test of this with 20 people and five other olive oils.
p154
aVIt tasted fine. It tasted interesting.
p155
aVIt was very green, it was very peppery.
p156
aVBut in the blind taste test, it came in last.
p157
aVThe olive oil that came in first was actually a bottle of
p158
aVWhole Foods 365 olive oil which had been oxidizing next to my stove
p159
aVfor six months.
p160
aa(lp161
V(Laughter)
p162
aa(lp163
VA recurring theme is that a lot of these things are from Japan \u2014
p164
aVyou'll start to notice.
p165
aa(lp166
VI don't play golf, so I couldn't actually road test these,
p167
aVbut I did interview a guy who owns them.
p168
aVEven the people who market these clubs \u2014 I mean, they'll say
p169
aVthese have four axis shafts which minimize loss of club speed
p170
aVand thereby drive the ball farther \u2014 but they'll say, look, you know,
p171
aVyou're not getting 57,000 dollars worth of performance from these clubs.
p172
aVYou're paying for the bling,
p173
aVthat they're encrusted with gold and platinum.
p174
aVThe guy who I interviewed who owns them did say
p175
aVthat he's gotten a lot of pleasure out of them, so ...
p176
aa(lp177
VOh, yeah, you know this one?
p178
aVThis is a coffee made from a very unusual process.
p179
aVThe luwak is an Asian Palm Civet.
p180
aVIt's a cat that lives in trees,
p181
aVand at night it comes down and it prowls the coffee plantations.
p182
aVAnd apparently it's a very picky eater and it, you know,
p183
aVhones in on only the ripest coffee cherries.
p184
aVAnd then an enzyme in its digestive tract leeches into the beans,
p185
aVand people with the unenviable job of collecting these cats' leavings
p186
aVthen go through the forest collecting the, you know, results
p187
aVand processing it into coffee \u2014 although you actually can buy it
p188
aVin the unprocessed form.
p189
aVThat's right.
p190
aa(lp191
VUnrelatedly \u2014
p192
aa(lp193
V(Laughter)
p194
aa(lp195
VJapan is doing crazy things with toilets.
p196
aa(lp197
V(Laughter)
p198
aa(lp199
VThere is now a toilet that has an MP3 player in it.
p200
aVThere's one with a fragrance dispenser.
p201
aVThere's one that actually analyzes the contents of the bowl
p202
aVand transmits the results via email to your doctor.
p203
aVIt's almost like a home medical center \u2014
p204
aVand that is the direction that Japanese toilet technology is heading in.
p205
aVThis one does not have those bells and whistles,
p206
aVbut for pure functionality it's pretty much the best \u2014 the Neorest 600.
p207
aVAnd to try this \u2014 I couldn't get a loaner,
p208
aVbut I did go into the Manhattan showroom of the manufacturer, Toto,
p209
aVand they have a bathroom off of the showroom that you can use, which I used.
p210
aVIt's fully automated \u2014 you walk towards it, and the seat lifts.
p211
aVThe seat is preheated.
p212
aVThere's a water jet that cleans you.
p213
aVThere's an air jet that dries you.
p214
aVYou get up, it flushes by itself.
p215
aVThe lid closes, it self-cleans.
p216
aVNot only is it a technological leap forward,
p217
aVbut I really do believe it's a bit of a cultural leap forward.
p218
aVI mean, a no hands, no toilet paper toilet.
p219
aVAnd I want to get one of these.
p220
aa(lp221
V(Laughter)
p222
aa(lp223
VThis was another one I could not get a loaner of.
p224
aVTom Cruise supposedly owns this bed.
p225
aVThere's a little plaque on the end that, you know,
p226
aVeach buyer gets their name engraved on it.
p227
aa(lp228
V(Laughter)
p229
aa(lp230
VTo try this one, the maker of it let me and my wife
p231
aVspend the night in the Manhattan showroom.
p232
aVLights glaring in off the street,
p233
aVand we had to hire a security guard and all these things.
p234
aVBut anyway, we had a great night's sleep.
p235
aVAnd you spend a third of your life in bed.
p236
aVI don't think it's that bad of a deal.
p237
aa(lp238
V(Laughter)
p239
aa(lp240
VThis was a fun one.
p241
aVThis is the fastest street-legal car in the world
p242
aVand the most expensive production car.
p243
aVI got to drive this with a chaperone from the company,
p244
aVa professional race car driver,
p245
aVand we drove around the canyons outside of Los Angeles
p246
aVand down on the Pacific Coast Highway.
p247
aVAnd, you know, when we pulled up to a stoplight
p248
aVthe people in the adjacent cars kind of gave us respectful nods.
p249
aVAnd it was really amazing.
p250
aVIt was such a smooth ride.
p251
aVMost of the cars that I drive, if I get up to 80 they start to rattle.
p252
aVI switched lanes on the highway and the driver, this chaperone, said,
p253
aV"You know, you were just going 110 miles an hour."
p254
aVAnd I had no idea that I was one of those obnoxious people
p255
aVyou occasionally see weaving in and out of traffic,
p256
aVbecause it was just that smooth.
p257
aVAnd if I was a billionaire, I would get one.
p258
aa(lp259
V(Laughter)
p260
aa(lp261
VThis is a completely gratuitous video I'm just going to show
p262
aVof one of the pitfalls of advanced technology.
p263
aVThis is Tom Cruise arriving at the "Mission: Impossible III" premiere.
p264
aVWhen he tries to open the door,
p265
aVyou could call it "Mission: Impossible IV."
p266
aa(lp267
VThere was one object that I could not get my hands on,
p268
aVand that was the 1947 Cheval Blanc.
p269
aVThe '47 Cheval Blanc is probably the most mythologized wine of the 20th century.
p270
aVAnd Cheval Blanc is kind of an unusual wine for Bordeaux
p271
aVin having a significant percentage of the Cabernet Franc grape.
p272
aVAnd 1947 was a legendary vintage,
p273
aVespecially in the right bank of Bordeaux.
p274
aVAnd just together, that vintage and that chateau took on this aura
p275
aVthat eventually kind of gave it this cultish following.
p276
aVBut it's 60 years old.
p277
aVThere's not much of it left.
p278
aVWhat there is of it left you don't know if it's real \u2014
p279
aVit's considered to be the most faked wine in the world.
p280
aVNot that many people are looking to pop open
p281
aVtheir one remaining bottle for a journalist.
p282
aa(lp283
VSo, I'd about given up trying to get my hands on one of these.
p284
aVI'd put out feelers to retailers, to auctioneers,
p285
aVand it was coming up empty.
p286
aVAnd then I got an email from a guy named Bipin Desai.
p287
aVBipin Desai is a U.C. Riverside theoretical physicist
p288
aVwho also happens to be the preeminent organizer of rare wine tastings,
p289
aVand he said, "I've got a tasting coming up
p290
aVwhere we're going to serve the '47 Cheval Blanc."
p291
aVAnd it was going to be a double vertical \u2014
p292
aVit was going to be 30 vintages of Cheval Blanc,
p293
aVand 30 vintages of Yquem.
p294
aVAnd it was an invitation you do not refuse.
p295
aVI went.
p296
aa(lp297
VIt was three days, four meals.
p298
aVAnd at lunch on Saturday, we opened the '47.
p299
aVAnd you know, it had this fragrant softness,
p300
aVand it smelled a little bit of linseed oil.
p301
aVAnd then I tasted it, and it,
p302
aVyou know, had this kind of unctuous, porty richness,
p303
aVwhich is characteristic of that wine \u2014
p304
aVthat it sort of resembles port in a lot of ways.
p305
aVThere were people at my table who thought it was, you know, fantastic.
p306
aVThere were some people who were a little less impressed.
p307
aVAnd I wasn't that impressed.
p308
aVAnd I don't \u2014 call my palate a philistine palate \u2014
p309
aVso it doesn't necessarily mean something that I wasn't impressed,
p310
aVbut I was not the only one there who had that reaction.
p311
aVAnd it wasn't just to that wine.
p312
aVAny one of the wines served at this tasting,
p313
aVif I'd been served it at a dinner party, it would have been, you know,
p314
aVthe wine experience of my lifetime, and incredibly memorable.
p315
aVBut drinking 60 great wines over three days,
p316
aVthey all just blurred together,
p317
aVand it became almost a grueling experience.
p318
aa(lp319
VAnd I just wanted to finish by mentioning a very interesting study
p320
aVwhich came out earlier this year from some researchers at Stanford and Caltech.
p321
aVAnd they gave subjects the same wine,
p322
aVlabeled with different price tags.
p323
aVA lot of people, you know,
p324
aVsaid that they liked the more expensive wine more \u2014
p325
aVit was the same wine, but they thought it was a different one
p326
aVthat was more expensive.
p327
aVBut what was unexpected was that these researchers did
p328
aVMRI brain imaging while the people were drinking the wine,
p329
aVand not only did they say they enjoyed the more expensively labeled wine more \u2014
p330
aVtheir brain actually registered as experiencing more pleasure
p331
aVfrom the same wine when it was labeled with a higher price tag.
p332
aa(lp333
VThank you.
