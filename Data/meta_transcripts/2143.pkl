VSo in the oasis of  intelligentsia that is TED,
p4
aVI stand here before you this evening
p5
aVas an expert in dragging heavy stuff around cold places.
p6
aVI've been leading polar expeditions  for most of my adult life,
p7
aVand last month, my teammate  Tarka L'Herpiniere and I
p8
aVfinished the most ambitious  expedition I've ever attempted.
p9
aVIn fact, it feels like I've been transported straight here
p10
aVfrom four months in the middle of nowhere,
p11
aVmostly grunting and swearing,  straight to the TED stage.
p12
aVSo you can imagine that's a transition that hasn't been entirely seamless.
p13
aVOne of the interesting side effects
p14
aVseems to be that my short-term memory is entirely shot.
p15
aVSo I've had to write some notes
p16
aVto avoid too much grunting and swearing in the next 17 minutes.
p17
aVThis is the first talk I've given about this expedition,
p18
aVand while we weren't sequencing genomes or building space telescopes,
p19
aVthis is a story about giving everything we had to achieve something
p20
aVthat hadn't been done before.
p21
aVSo I hope in that you might  find some food for thought.
p22
aa(lp23
VIt was a journey, an  expedition in Antarctica,
p24
aVthe coldest, windiest, driest and highest altitude continent on Earth.
p25
aVIt's a fascinating place. It's a huge place.
p26
aVIt's twice the size of Australia,
p27
aVa continent that is the same size as China and India put together.
p28
aa(lp29
VAs an aside, I have experienced
p30
aVan interesting phenomenon in the last few days,
p31
aVsomething that I expect Chris Hadfield may get at TED in a few years' time,
p32
aVconversations that go something like this:
p33
aV"Oh, Antarctica. Awesome.
p34
aVMy husband and I did Antarctica with Lindblad for our anniversary."
p35
aVOr, "Oh cool, did you go there for the marathon?"
p36
aV(Laughter)
p37
aa(lp38
VOur journey was, in fact, 69 marathons back to back
p39
aVin 105 days, an 1,800-mile round trip on foot from the coast of Antarctica
p40
aVto the South Pole and back again.
p41
aVIn the process, we broke the record
p42
aVfor the longest human-powered polar journey in history by more than 400 miles.
p43
aV(Applause)
p44
aVFor those of you from the Bay Area,
p45
aVit was the same as walking from  here to San Francisco,
p46
aVthen turning around and walking back again.
p47
aVSo as camping trips go, it was a long one,
p48
aVand one I've seen summarized  most succinctly here
p49
aVon the hallowed pages  of Business Insider Malaysia.
p50
aV["Two Explorers Just Completed A Polar Expedition  That Killed Everyone The Last Time It Was Attempted"]
p51
aa(lp52
VChris Hadfield talked so eloquently
p53
aVabout fear and about the odds of success, and indeed the odds of survival.
p54
aVOf the nine people in history that had attempted this journey before us,
p55
aVnone had made it to the pole and back,
p56
aVand five had died in the process.
p57
aa(lp58
VThis is Captain Robert Falcon Scott.
p59
aVHe led the last team to attempt this expedition.
p60
aVScott and his rival Sir Ernest Shackleton,
p61
aVover the space of a decade,
p62
aVboth led expeditions battling to become the first to reach the South Pole,
p63
aVto chart and map the interior of Antarctica,
p64
aVa place we knew less about, at the time,
p65
aVthan the surface of the moon,
p66
aVbecause we could see the moon through telescopes.
p67
aVAntarctica was, for the most part, a century ago, uncharted.
p68
aa(lp69
VSome of you may know the story.
p70
aVScott's last expedition, the  Terra Nova Expedition in 1910,
p71
aVstarted as a giant siege-style approach.
p72
aVHe had a big team using ponies,
p73
aVusing dogs, using petrol-driven tractors,
p74
aVdropping multiple, pre-positioned depots of food and fuel
p75
aVthrough which Scott's final team of five would travel to the Pole,
p76
aVwhere they would turn around and ski  back to the coast again on foot.
p77
aVScott and his final team of five
p78
aVarrived at the South Pole  in January 1912
p79
aVto find they had been beaten to it by a Norwegian team led by Roald Amundsen,
p80
aVwho rode on dogsled.
p81
aVScott's team ended up on foot.
p82
aVAnd for more than a century this journey has remained unfinished.
p83
aVScott's team of five died  on the return journey.
p84
aVAnd for the last decade,
p85
aVI've been asking myself why that is.
p86
aVHow come this has remained  the high-water mark?
p87
aVScott's team covered 1,600 miles on foot.
p88
aVNo one's come close to that ever since.
p89
aVSo this is the high-water mark  of human endurance,
p90
aVhuman endeavor,  human athletic achievement
p91
aVin arguably the harshest climate on Earth.
p92
aVIt was as if the marathon record
p93
aVhas remained unbroken since 1912.
p94
aVAnd of course some strange and  predictable combination of curiosity,
p95
aVstubbornness, and probably hubris
p96
aVled me to thinking I might be the man to try to finish the job.
p97
aa(lp98
VUnlike Scott's expedition, there were just two of us,
p99
aVand we set off from the coast of Antarctica in October last year,
p100
aVdragging everything ourselves,
p101
aVa process Scott called "man-hauling."
p102
aVWhen I say it was like walking from here to San Francisco and back,
p103
aVI actually mean it was like dragging something that weighs a shade more
p104
aVthan the heaviest ever NFL player.
p105
aVOur sledges weighed 200 kilos,
p106
aVor 440 pounds each at the start,
p107
aVthe same weights that the weakest of Scott's ponies pulled.
p108
aVEarly on, we averaged 0.5 miles per hour.
p109
aVPerhaps the reason no one had  attempted this journey until now,
p110
aVin more than a century,
p111
aVwas that no one had been quite stupid enough to try.
p112
aVAnd while I can't claim we were exploring
p113
aVin the genuine Edwardian sense of the word \u2014
p114
aVwe weren't naming any mountains or mapping any uncharted valleys \u2014
p115
aVI think we were stepping into uncharted territory in a human sense.
p116
aVCertainly, if in the future we learn there is an area of the human brain
p117
aVthat lights up when one curses oneself,
p118
aVI won't be at all surprised.
p119
aa(lp120
VYou've heard that the average American spends 90 percent of their time indoors.
p121
aVWe didn't go indoors for nearly four months.
p122
aVWe didn't see a sunset either.
p123
aVIt was 24-hour daylight.
p124
aVLiving conditions were quite spartan.
p125
aVI changed my underwear  three times in 105 days
p126
aVand Tarka and I shared  30 square feet on the canvas.
p127
aVThough we did have some technology that Scott could never have imagined.
p128
aVAnd we blogged live every evening from the tent via a laptop
p129
aVand a custom-made satellite transmitter,
p130
aVall of which were solar-powered:
p131
aVwe had a flexible photovoltaic panel over the tent.
p132
aVAnd the writing was important to me.
p133
aVAs a kid, I was inspired by the  literature of adventure and exploration,
p134
aVand I think we've all seen here this week
p135
aVthe importance and  the power of storytelling.
p136
aa(lp137
VSo we had some 21st-century gear,
p138
aVbut the reality is that the  challenges that Scott faced
p139
aVwere the same that we faced:
p140
aVthose of the weather and of  what Scott called glide,
p141
aVthe amount of friction between the sledges and the snow.
p142
aVThe lowest wind chill  we experienced was in the -70s,
p143
aVand we had zero visibility, what's called white-out,
p144
aVfor much of our journey.
p145
aVWe traveled up and down one of the largest
p146
aVand most dangerous glaciers in the world, the Beardmore glacier.
p147
aVIt's 110 miles long; most of its surface is what's called blue ice.
p148
aVYou can see it's a beautiful,  shimmering steel-hard blue surface
p149
aVcovered with thousands  and thousands of crevasses,
p150
aVthese deep cracks in the glacial ice  up to 200 feet deep.
p151
aVPlanes can't land here,
p152
aVso we were at the most risk,
p153
aVtechnically, when we had the slimmest chance of being rescued.
p154
aa(lp155
VWe got to the South Pole after 61 days on foot,
p156
aVwith one day off for bad weather,
p157
aVand I'm sad to say, it was something of an anticlimax.
p158
aVThere's a permanent American base,
p159
aVthe Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station at the South Pole.
p160
aVThey have an airstrip, they have a canteen,
p161
aVthey have hot showers,
p162
aVthey have a post office, a tourist shop,
p163
aVa basketball court that doubles as a movie theater.
p164
aVSo it's a bit different these days,
p165
aVand there are also acres of junk.
p166
aVI think it's a marvelous thing
p167
aVthat humans can exist 365 days of the year
p168
aVwith hamburgers and hot showers and movie theaters,
p169
aVbut it does seem to produce a lot of empty cardboard boxes.
p170
aVYou can see on the left of  this photograph,
p171
aVseveral square acres of junk
p172
aVwaiting to be flown out from the South Pole.
p173
aVBut there is also a pole at the South Pole,
p174
aVand we got there on foot, unassisted,
p175
aVunsupported, by the hardest route,
p176
aV900 miles in record time,
p177
aVdragging more weight than anyone in history.
p178
aVAnd if we'd stopped there  and flown home,
p179
aVwhich would have been the eminently sensible thing to do,
p180
aVthen my talk would end here
p181
aVand it would end something like this.
p182
aa(lp183
VIf you have the right team around you, the right tools, the right technology,
p184
aVand if you have enough self-belief and enough determination,
p185
aVthen anything is possible.
p186
aa(lp187
VBut then we turned around,
p188
aVand this is where things get interesting.
p189
aVHigh on the Antarctic plateau,
p190
aVover 10,000 feet, it's very windy, very cold, very dry, we were exhausted.
p191
aVWe'd covered 35 marathons,
p192
aVwe were only halfway,
p193
aVand we had a safety net, of course,
p194
aVof ski planes and satellite phones
p195
aVand live, 24-hour tracking beacons that didn't exist for Scott,
p196
aVbut in hindsight,
p197
aVrather than making our lives easier,
p198
aVthe safety net actually allowed us
p199
aVto cut things very fine indeed,
p200
aVto sail very close to our absolute limits as human beings.
p201
aVAnd it is an exquisite form of torture
p202
aVto exhaust yourself to the point of starvation day after day
p203
aVwhile dragging a sledge full of food.
p204
aa(lp205
VFor years, I'd been writing glib lines in sponsorship proposals
p206
aVabout pushing the limits of human endurance,
p207
aVbut in reality, that was  a very frightening place to be indeed.
p208
aVWe had, before we'd got to the Pole,
p209
aVtwo weeks of almost permanent headwind, which slowed us down.
p210
aVAs a result, we'd had several days of eating half rations.
p211
aVWe had a finite amount of food in the sledges to make this journey,
p212
aVso we were trying to string that out
p213
aVby reducing our intake to half  the calories we should have been eating.
p214
aVAs a result, we both became increasingly hypoglycemic \u2014
p215
aVwe had low blood sugar  levels day after day \u2014
p216
aVand increasingly susceptible to the extreme cold.
p217
aVTarka took this photo of me one evening
p218
aVafter I'd nearly passed out with hypothermia.
p219
aVWe both had repeated bouts of hypothermia, something I hadn't experienced before,
p220
aVand it was very humbling indeed.
p221
aVAs much as you might like to think, as I do,
p222
aVthat you're the kind of person who doesn't quit,
p223
aVthat you'll go down swinging,
p224
aVhypothermia doesn't leave you much choice.
p225
aVYou become utterly incapacitated.
p226
aVIt's like being a drunk toddler.
p227
aVYou become pathetic.
p228
aVI remember just wanting to lie down and quit.
p229
aVIt was a peculiar, peculiar feeling,
p230
aVand a real surprise to me to be debilitated to that degree.
p231
aa(lp232
VAnd then we ran out of food completely,
p233
aV46 miles short of the first of the depots
p234
aVthat we'd laid on our outward journey.
p235
aVWe'd laid 10 depots of food,
p236
aVliterally burying food and fuel, for our return journey \u2014
p237
aVthe fuel was for a cooker so you could melt snow to get water \u2014
p238
aVand I was forced to make the decision to call for a resupply flight,
p239
aVa ski plane carrying eight days of food to tide us over that gap.
p240
aVThey took 12 hours to reach us from the other side of Antarctica.
p241
aa(lp242
VCalling for that plane was one of  the toughest decisions of my life.
p243
aVAnd I sound like a bit of a fraud standing here now with a sort of belly.
p244
aVI've put on 30 pounds in the last three weeks.
p245
aVBeing that hungry has left an interesting mental scar,
p246
aVwhich is that I've been hoovering up every hotel buffet that I can find.
p247
aV(Laughter)
p248
aVBut we were genuinely quite hungry, and in quite a bad way.
p249
aVI don't regret calling for that plane for a second,
p250
aVbecause I'm still standing here alive,
p251
aVwith all digits intact,  telling this story.
p252
aVBut getting external assistance like that was never part of the plan,
p253
aVand it's something my ego is still struggling with.
p254
aVThis was the biggest dream I've ever had,
p255
aVand it was so nearly perfect.
p256
aa(lp257
VOn the way back down to the coast,
p258
aVour crampons \u2014 they're  the spikes on our boots
p259
aVthat we have for traveling over this blue ice on the glacier \u2014
p260
aVbroke on the top of the Beardmore.
p261
aVWe still had 100 miles to go downhill
p262
aVon very slippery rock-hard blue ice.
p263
aVThey needed repairing almost every hour.
p264
aVTo give you an idea of scale,
p265
aVthis is looking down towards the mouth of the Beardmore Glacier.
p266
aVYou could fit the entirety of Manhattan in the gap on the horizon.
p267
aVThat's 20 miles between Mount Hope and Mount Kiffin.
p268
aVI've never felt as small  as I did in Antarctica.
p269
aVWhen we got down to the mouth of the glacier,
p270
aVwe found fresh snow had obscured the dozens of deep crevasses.
p271
aVOne of Shackleton's men described crossing this sort of terrain
p272
aVas like walking over the glass roof of a railway station.
p273
aVWe fell through more times than I can remember,
p274
aVusually just putting a ski or a boot through the snow.
p275
aVOccasionally we went in all  the way up to our armpits,
p276
aVbut thankfully never deeper than that.
p277
aa(lp278
VAnd less than five weeks ago, after 105 days,
p279
aVwe crossed this oddly  inauspicious finish line,
p280
aVthe coast of Ross Island  on the New Zealand side of Antarctica.
p281
aVYou can see the ice in the foreground
p282
aVand the sort of rubbly rock behind that.
p283
aVBehind us lay an unbroken  ski trail of nearly 1,800 miles.
p284
aVWe'd made the longest ever polar journey on foot,
p285
aVsomething I'd been dreaming  of doing for a decade.
p286
aa(lp287
VAnd looking back,
p288
aVI still stand by all the things
p289
aVI've been saying for years
p290
aVabout the importance of goals
p291
aVand determination and self-belief,
p292
aVbut I'll also admit that I hadn't given much thought to what happens
p293
aVwhen you reach the all-consuming goal
p294
aVthat you've dedicated  most of your adult life to,
p295
aVand the reality is that I'm  still figuring that bit out.
p296
aVAs I said, there are very few superficial signs that I've been away.
p297
aVI've put on 30 pounds.
p298
aVI've got some very faint, probably  covered in makeup now, frostbite scars.
p299
aVI've got one on my nose, one on  each cheek, from where the goggles are,
p300
aVbut inside I am a very  different person indeed.
p301
aVIf I'm honest,
p302
aVAntarctica challenged me and humbled me so deeply
p303
aVthat I'm not sure I'll ever be able to put it into words.
p304
aVI'm still struggling to piece together my thoughts.
p305
aVThat I'm standing here  telling this story
p306
aVis proof that we all can  accomplish great things,
p307
aVthrough ambition, through passion,
p308
aVthrough sheer stubbornness,
p309
aVby refusing to quit,
p310
aVthat if you dream something  hard enough, as Sting said,
p311
aVit does indeed come to pass.
p312
aVBut I'm also standing here  saying, you know what,
p313
aVthat cliche about the journey being  more important than the destination?
p314
aVThere's something in that.
p315
aVThe closer I got to my finish line,
p316
aVthat rubbly, rocky coast of Ross Island,
p317
aVthe more I started to realize that the biggest lesson
p318
aVthat this very long, very hard walk might be teaching me
p319
aVis that happiness is not a finish line,
p320
aVthat for us humans,
p321
aVthe perfection that so many of us seem to dream of
p322
aVmight not ever be truly attainable,
p323
aVand that if we can't feel content here, today, now, on our journeys
p324
aVamidst the mess and the striving that we all inhabit,
p325
aVthe open loops,  the half-finished to-do lists,
p326
aVthe could-do-better-next-times,
p327
aVthen we might never feel it.
p328
aa(lp329
VA lot of people have asked me, what next?
p330
aVRight now, I am very happy just recovering and in front of hotel buffets.
p331
aVBut as Bob Hope put it,
p332
aVI feel very humble,
p333
aVbut I think I have the strength of character to fight it. (Laughter)
p334
aa(lp335
VThank you.
