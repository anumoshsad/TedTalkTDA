VDan Holzman: Please throw out the beanbag chairs. Here we go.
p4
aa(lp5
VBarry Friedman: There are all kinds of high-tech chairs here today,
p6
aVbut this is really, I think, when it reached its peak
p7
aVas far as ergonomics, comfort, design, flexibility ...
p8
aa(lp9
VDH: Now obviously, this is not something we do on our regular show;
p10
aVit's something we just kind of learned for this,
p11
aVso we're going to try. But can we have some inspirational music for the beanbag chairs?
p12
aa(lp13
VBF: Nice show, Daniel, nice show. You are the man!
p14
aVNice show. Man, that was good!
p15
aVDH: Thank you.
p16
aVBF: You know, sometimes when people do those, they go all the way down.
p17
aVYou actually just did that. (Laughter)
p18
aVThat's the kind of extra effort that's gotten us where we are today ...
p19
aa(lp20
VDH: All right, let's show them something special.
p21
aa(lp22
VBF: ... without a MacArthur grant.
p23
aVYeah, look at this. You know, all kinds of different ...
p24
aVTED is about invention, let's be honest. Right? DH: Yeah, it is.
p25
aa(lp26
VBF: Last night, Michael Moschen showed some juggling props
p27
aVhe has invented and working on.
p28
aVRight now, Dan's going to show something he actually invented.
p29
aa(lp30
VDH: A type of juggling I actually invented,
p31
aVright after I saw another juggler do it.
p32
aa(lp33
VBF: Shut up. (Laughter)
p34
aa(lp35
VDH: And this is a small excerpt from a longer piece.
p36
aa(lp37
V(Laughter)
p38
aa(lp39
V(Applause)
p40
aa(lp41
VFolks, this is shaker cup juggling. It's not a showstopper
p42
aVbut it certainly slows it down.
p43
aa(lp44
VBF: Oh yeah, it does. (Drum roll)
p45
aVBF: Oh, Daniel.
p46
aa(lp47
V(Applause)
p48
aa(lp49
VDH: One more? (Drum roll)
p50
aVPerfect. (Drum roll)
p51
aVPerfect. (Drum roll)
p52
aVBF: OK. DH: Oh! All right.
p53
aa(lp54
V(Applause)
p55
aa(lp56
VI'm now pushing my luck: I'm skipping right to six cups.
p57
aVIn order to do six cups, I must have perfect control
p58
aVover three with my right hand. (Drum roll)
p59
aa(lp60
VBF: Also three with his left.
p61
aa(lp62
VDH: Perfect.
p63
aa(lp64
V(Laughter)
p65
aa(lp66
VAnd now, all six cups. Should I do it on the first try
p67
aVor should I miss once on purpose? (Laughter)
p68
aa(lp69
VBF: First try? Once on purpose?
p70
aa(lp71
V(Audience: Once on purpose!)
p72
aa(lp73
VDH: How about if I try first and then decide?
p74
aa(lp75
VBF: Good idea. (Laughter) Let's leave that. We'll leave that door open.
p76
aa(lp77
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p78
aa(lp79
VDH: He's looking at me.
p80
aa(lp81
VBF: That's all right, he does that. All right.
p82
aa(lp83
VDH: Oh! It's time for Richard's help. (Laughter)
p84
aVOh, good. All right.
p85
aa(lp86
VBF: You know, over the years, every year at the conference,
p87
aVit's kind of become a tradition for us to do something dangerous
p88
aVwith Richard. And we've always done something with the bullwhips
p89
aVin our act. It's funny, for years I did it with Daniel holding balloons.
p90
aVAnd then we thought, "How stupid."
p91
aa(lp92
VDH: Excuse me, could we work on the design of the microphone?
p93
aa(lp94
VBF: I think that's the next session.
p95
aa(lp96
VDH: Next session?
p97
aa(lp98
VBF: Yeah. And so we've actually found a way to incorporate Richard in this.
p99
aVHe actually assumes more of the danger in this.
p100
aa(lp101
VDH: Please stand up, Richard. (Whip cracks)
p102
aa(lp103
VOh, sorry. (Laughter)
p104
aa(lp105
VDH: Now Richard, please ... (Whip cracks)
p106
aa(lp107
VBF: OK, sorry.
p108
aa(lp109
VDH: Jesus Christ. Richard, please stand in front of me.
p110
aa(lp111
VRichard Wurman: Can I say something?
p112
aVBF: Sure.
p113
aa(lp114
VRW: In all past years I've rehearsed with them,
p115
aVthe things that have happened to me \u2014
p116
aVI have no idea what's going to happen and that's the truth.
p117
aa(lp118
VDH: All right, please stand here in front ...
p119
aVGod, I hate that. Put your hands out like this, please.
p120
aa(lp121
V(Laughter)
p122
aa(lp123
VBF: No, come stay up with him.
p124
aVDan used to actually hold them but now he's got you for protection.
p125
aVIt's kind of neat. OK.
p126
aa(lp127
V(Laughter)
p128
aa(lp129
VDH: Wow, you've been working out.
p130
aa(lp131
VBF: No, shut up!
p132
aa(lp133
V(Laughter)
p134
aa(lp135
VHaving a little bit of Richard time. That's nice, that's good.
p136
aVOK, here we go.
p137
aVHave him hold your wrist so I can ...
p138
aa(lp139
VDH: Please hold my wrist, will you. BF: Yeah, hold this a minute.
p140
aa(lp141
VThere you go.
p142
aa(lp143
V(Laughter)
p144
aVOK.
p145
aa(lp146
VOK, hold on.
p147
aa(lp148
VRW: Hmmm.
p149
aa(lp150
V(Laughter)
p151
aa(lp152
VDH: First one.
p153
aa(lp154
VBF: All those mid-year phone calls are coming back to me now, Richard.
p155
aa(lp156
V(Laughter)
p157
aa(lp158
VDH: So Richard, what were we on the list? Like 1,020?
p159
aa(lp160
V(Laughter)
p161
aa(lp162
VWhat happened there?
p163
aa(lp164
VBF: I think we were just outside.
p165
aa(lp166
VDH: I don't get it. (Applause)
p167
aa(lp168
V(Laughter)
p169
aa(lp170
VDH: Sorry. BF: Having some bad flashbacks.
p171
aa(lp172
VRW: Do you want me to hold you or not? DH: Don't hold me that hard.
p173
aa(lp174
VBF: Here we go, I'm taking it. (Balloon pops) (Applause)
p175
aa(lp176
VDH: One more, one more.
p177
aa(lp178
VBF: We've got one more we're going to do.
p179
aa(lp180
VRW: Do I get to hold them?
p181
aa(lp182
VBF: You don't want to hold these, trust me.
p183
aa(lp184
VDH: Could you spread your legs a little bit?
p185
aa(lp186
V(Laughter)
p187
aa(lp188
VBF: Gloria, you want to do it? It's very cool.
p189
aa(lp190
V(Laughter)
p191
aa(lp192
V(Applause)
p193
aa(lp194
V(Laughter)
p195
aa(lp196
VOne more try. Man, I don't want to get too close.
p197
aa(lp198
V(Laughter)
p199
aa(lp200
VCould you just push that?
p201
aa(lp202
V(Applause)
p203
aa(lp204
VDH: Wow! Boy!
p205
aa(lp206
VBF: That's cool. I always wanted to try that.
p207
aa(lp208
V(Laughter)
p209
aa(lp210
VDH: Let's jump this way, though.
p211
aVNow, we risked Richard's life, it's only fair we risk our own lives.
p212
aVSo to do that, I will juggle these three razor-sharp sickles.
p213
aVAnd if that wasn't enough, and judging by your response, it's not ...
p214
aa(lp215
V(Laughter)
p216
aa(lp217
VDH: Wow! BF: Hoping for a little more build.
p218
aa(lp219
VDH: True. Barry ...
p220
aa(lp221
VBF: I'm going to run up behind him.
p222
aa(lp223
VDH: Leap over my shoulder.
p224
aa(lp225
VBF: Up and over his shoulders.
p226
aa(lp227
VDH: Grab the blades in mid-air, land right there in a pool of blood ...
p228
aa(lp229
V(Laughter)
p230
aa(lp231
VStill juggling. (Laughter)
p232
aVImpossible, you say?
p233
aa(lp234
VBF: Incredible, you say?
p235
aa(lp236
VDH: Why bother, you say?
p237
aa(lp238
VBF: Here we go.
p239
aa(lp240
VDH: Just do it juggler boys, you say?
p241
aa(lp242
VBF: This guy, this guy invented air.
p243
aVDH: I think so, that's right.
p244
aVEven the pencil.
p245
aa(lp246
VBF: He invented the pencil.
p247
aa(lp248
VDH: All right, we'll do this trick, but please remember
p249
aVit took us over 10 years to perfect.
p250
aa(lp251
VBF: Ten years to perfect, which you're about to see.
p252
aa(lp253
VDH: It's not that difficult, we just don't like to practice that much.
p254
aa(lp255
VBF: No, it's a hassle. Traveling too much.
p256
aVActually, we will take a second to prove \u2014
p257
aVthis could be fake \u2014 that the blades are indeed razor-sharp.
p258
aa(lp259
VDH: Will someone please throw a small farm animal
p260
aVup onto the stage?
p261
aa(lp262
V(Laughter)
p263
aa(lp264
VOr a virgin for a sacrifice?
p265
aa(lp266
VBF: Anything?
p267
aa(lp268
VDH: Where's Gloria? (Laughter)
p269
aa(lp270
VBF: No, she's got ... farm animal.
p271
aa(lp272
VDH: Do you have a small farm animal?
p273
aVJust trying to play the odds. All right, here we go.
p274
aa(lp275
VBF: Over the top, over the top.
p276
aa(lp277
VDH: How you feeling, Barry? You feeling all right?
p278
aa(lp279
VBF: Yeah, it's all right.
p280
aa(lp281
VDH: Do you feel everything's OK? The atmosphere, the ...
p282
aa(lp283
VBF: Yeah, a little sketchy.
p284
aa(lp285
VDH: Everything up here's OK?
p286
aa(lp287
VBF: Yeah.
p288
aa(lp289
VDH: Then here we go.
p290
aa(lp291
VBF: This one's a little ... Who's doing the lights? Could you
p292
aVpoint that a little more directly
p293
aVinto my eyeballs? Is that possible? (Laughter) I can still see a little.
p294
aa(lp295
VDH: And turn up the intensity; we're still pink in the middle.
p296
aVWe went too far. (Laughter)
p297
aa(lp298
VBF: Yeah, it's too far. It's too much of a visual.
p299
aVThe design of the body is a whole different thing.
p300
aa(lp301
VDH: Ready, Barry? BF: Over the top.
p302
aa(lp303
VDH: May we have our jumping music please? (Silence)
p304
aVMay we have it a bit louder?
p305
aa(lp306
V(Laughter)
p307
aa(lp308
VBF: They're a good crew! Whoa!
p309
aa(lp310
VDH: Whoa, sorry. All right.
p311
aa(lp312
VBF: We're going on.
p313
aa(lp314
VDH: All right, we'll try again.
p315
aa(lp316
VBF: All right? Oh my gosh. Oh.
p317
aa(lp318
VDH: All right, here we go. Sorry about that.
p319
aa(lp320
VBF: I thought I had the hard part. OK.
p321
aa(lp322
VDH: Whenever you're ready.
p323
aa(lp324
VBF: There we go!
p325
aa(lp326
V(Applause)
p327
aa(lp328
VAll right, get up! Come on and dance! DH: Dance, come on. BF: Come on and dance!
p329
aVSomebody dance! Come on!
p330
aa(lp331
V(Applause)
p332
aa(lp333
VWow, wow, OK, stop.
p334
aVWeird, no one dances. We're two guys doing this. (Laughter)
p335
aVI think that's uncomfortable for everyone.
p336
aa(lp337
VDH: The French judge ...
p338
aa(lp339
VBF: One more quick thing.
p340
aa(lp341
VDH: The French judge gives it a 5.2.
p342
aa(lp343
V(Laughter)
p344
aa(lp345
VBF: Well, you know ...
p346
aa(lp347
VDH: There you go ... BF: Oh, yeah. Another one coming in.
p348
aa(lp349
VDH: Tell them about our bio and stuff.
p350
aa(lp351
VBF: Yeah. In our bio, some of you may have read
p352
aVthat we've won two world juggling championships.
p353
aVAnd believe it or not, you don't win juggling champions
p354
aVfor doing things with bullwhips or shaker cups.
p355
aVWe're going to show you right now
p356
aVan excerpt from a routine that we used
p357
aVto wipe out the other juggling team competition.
p358
aa(lp359
VDH: That's right.
p360
aa(lp361
VBF: Good.
p362
aa(lp363
VDH: I know what you're thinking: other juggling teams must really suck.
p364
aa(lp365
V(Laughter)
p366
aa(lp367
VBF: Juggling's got a bad rap.
p368
aa(lp369
VDH: But wait, Barry, there's still one more club lying there by my foot.
p370
aVAnd look, it has a twin!
p371
aa(lp372
VBF: Shut up. (Laughter)
p373
aa(lp374
VDH: There's still one more by my foot.
p375
aVWhat do you want me to do with it?
p376
aa(lp377
VBF: Richard you tell him, it's your last year. (Laughter)
p378
aa(lp379
VDH: That's a pretty good setup, Richard.
p380
aa(lp381
VBF: Yeah, it's a good setup. That's a big setup.
p382
aa(lp383
VDH: You can't get any better than that. All right. What I will do: I will use my panther-like reflexes.
p384
aa(lp385
VBF: Nice.
p386
aa(lp387
VDH: I got that \u2014
p388
aVto reach down and grab that club in my grip of steel.
p389
aa(lp390
VBF: Nice.
p391
aa(lp392
VDH: I touched it, Barry. That should be enough.
p393
aa(lp394
VBF: It's progress, that's the thing.
p395
aa(lp396
V(Laughter)
p397
aa(lp398
VDH: How about that? I'll do it again.
p399
aVOh wait, it's on your side, Barry.
p400
aVAnd it's awfully windy over there.
p401
aa(lp402
VBF: It is, it's weird. You wouldn't think
p403
aVit would affect half the stage, but it is. It's weird.
p404
aVWatch this: what I'm going to do is slide the seventh one onto my foot.
p405
aa(lp406
VDH: Wow! What a great trick, Barry!
p407
aVOh, look how it lies there.
p408
aVOh, Barry, is there nothing you can't do?
p409
aa(lp410
V(Laughter)
p411
aa(lp412
VYou are my hero. You're my Jim Shea, Jr.
p413
aVToo much Olympics.
p414
aa(lp415
VBF: From my foot, I'll attempt to kick the seventh club. Here we go.
p416
aa(lp417
VDH: Where, Barry? Where? Tell us, Barry.
p418
aV[Unclear] eagerly awaits your next syllable. What will it be?
p419
aVWhat gem of knowledge?
p420
aVWhat pearl of wisdom?
p421
aVDo you want to buy a vowel, Barry?
p422
aVIs that your final answer?
p423
aa(lp424
VBF: All right! You have to turn off the TV from time to time.
p425
aa(lp426
VDH: I do, I do.
p427
aVBF: From my foot, the kick up in the seven.
p428
aVDH: We will juggle seven.
p429
aa(lp430
VBF: From six to seven. DH: That's a world's record. BF: Really? DH: For us.
p431
aa(lp432
VBF: Yes.
p433
aa(lp434
VDH: Whenever you're ready there, big guy.
p435
aVPut your tongue away, Barry.
p436
aa(lp437
VBF: Oh, oh, whoa.
p438
aa(lp439
V(Applause)
p440
aa(lp441
VDH: Please, please stay seated. Stay seated. Thank you.
p442
aVBecause now, to make this twice as difficult,
p443
aVwe'll juggle the seven clubs back ...
p444
aa(lp445
VBF: Seven-club juggling.
p446
aa(lp447
VDH: ... to back.
p448
aa(lp449
VBF: Thank you, that's it.
p450
aa(lp451
VBF: Thank you guys!
