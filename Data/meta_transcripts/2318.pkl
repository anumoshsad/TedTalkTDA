VOver a million people are killed each year in disasters.
p4
aVTwo and a half million people will be permanently disabled or displaced,
p5
aVand the communities will take 20 to 30 years to recover
p6
aVand billions of economic losses.
p7
aa(lp8
VIf you can reduce the initial response by one day,
p9
aVyou can reduce the overall recovery
p10
aVby a thousand days, or three years.
p11
aVSee how that works?
p12
aVIf the initial responders can get in, save lives,
p13
aVmitigate whatever flooding danger there is,
p14
aVthat means the other groups can get in
p15
aVto restore the water, the roads, the electricity,
p16
aVwhich means then the construction people, the insurance agents,
p17
aVall of them can get in to rebuild the houses,
p18
aVwhich then means you can restore the economy,
p19
aVand maybe even make it better and more resilient to the next disaster.
p20
aVA major insurance company told me
p21
aVthat if they can get a homeowner's claim processed one day earlier,
p22
aVit'll make a difference of six months
p23
aVin that person getting their home repaired.
p24
aa(lp25
VAnd that's why I do disaster robotics \u2014
p26
aVbecause robots can make a disaster go away faster.
p27
aa(lp28
VNow, you've already seen a couple of these.
p29
aVThese are the UAVs.
p30
aVThese are two types of UAVs:
p31
aVa rotorcraft, or hummingbird;
p32
aVa fixed-wing, a hawk.
p33
aVAnd they're used extensively since 2005 \u2014
p34
aVHurricane Katrina.
p35
aVLet me show you how this hummingbird, this rotorcraft, works.
p36
aVFantastic for structural engineers.
p37
aVBeing able to see damage from angles you can't get from binoculars on the ground
p38
aVor from a satellite image,
p39
aVor anything flying at a higher angle.
p40
aVBut it's not just structural engineers and insurance people who need this.
p41
aVYou've got things like this fixed-wing, this hawk.
p42
aVNow, this hawk can be used for geospatial surveys.
p43
aVThat's where you're pulling imagery together
p44
aVand getting 3D reconstruction.
p45
aa(lp46
VWe used both of these at the Oso mudslides up in Washington State,
p47
aVbecause the big problem
p48
aVwas geospatial and hydrological understanding of the disaster \u2014
p49
aVnot the search and rescue.
p50
aVThe search and rescue teams had it under control
p51
aVand knew what they were doing.
p52
aVThe bigger problem was that river and mudslide might wipe them out
p53
aVand flood the responders.
p54
aVAnd not only was it challenging to the responders and property damage,
p55
aVit's also putting at risk the future of salmon fishing
p56
aValong that part of Washington State.
p57
aVSo they needed to understand what was going on.
p58
aVIn seven hours, going from Arlington,
p59
aVdriving from the Incident Command Post to the site, flying the UAVs,
p60
aVprocessing the data, driving back to Arlington command post \u2014
p61
aVseven hours.
p62
aVWe gave them in seven hours data that they could take
p63
aVonly two to three days to get any other way \u2014
p64
aVand at higher resolution.
p65
aVIt's a game changer.
p66
aa(lp67
VAnd don't just think about the UAVs.
p68
aVI mean, they are sexy \u2014 but remember,
p69
aV80 percent of the world's population lives by water,
p70
aVand that means our critical infrastructure is underwater \u2014
p71
aVthe parts that we can't get to, like the bridges and things like that.
p72
aVAnd that's why we have unmanned marine vehicles,
p73
aVone type of which you've already met, which is SARbot, a square dolphin.
p74
aVIt goes underwater and uses sonar.
p75
aVWell, why are marine vehicles so important
p76
aVand why are they very, very important?
p77
aVThey get overlooked.
p78
aVThink about the Japanese tsunami \u2014
p79
aV400 miles of coastland totally devastated,
p80
aVtwice the amount of coastland devastated by Hurricane Katrina in the United States.
p81
aVYou're talking about your bridges, your pipelines, your ports \u2014 wiped out.
p82
aVAnd if you don't have a port,
p83
aVyou don't have a way to get in enough relief supplies
p84
aVto support a population.
p85
aVThat was a huge problem at the Haiti earthquake.
p86
aVSo we need marine vehicles.
p87
aa(lp88
VNow, let's look at a viewpoint from the SARbot
p89
aVof what they were seeing.
p90
aVWe were working on a fishing port.
p91
aVWe were able to reopen that fishing port, using her sonar, in four hours.
p92
aVThat fishing port was told it was going to be six months
p93
aVbefore they could get a manual team of divers in,
p94
aVand it was going to take the divers two weeks.
p95
aVThey were going to miss the fall fishing season,
p96
aVwhich was the major economy for that part, which is kind of like their Cape Cod.
p97
aVUMVs, very important.
p98
aa(lp99
VBut you know, all the robots I've shown you have been small,
p100
aVand that's because robots don't do things that people do.
p101
aVThey go places people can't go.
p102
aVAnd a great example of that is Bujold.
p103
aVUnmanned ground vehicles are particularly small,
p104
aVso Bujold \u2014
p105
aa(lp106
V(Laughter)
p107
aa(lp108
VSay hello to Bujold.
p109
aa(lp110
V(Laughter)
p111
aa(lp112
VBujold was used extensively at the World Trade Center
p113
aVto go through Towers 1, 2 and 4.
p114
aVYou're climbing into the rubble, rappelling down, going deep in spaces.
p115
aVAnd just to see the World Trade Center from Bujold's viewpoint, look at this.
p116
aVYou're talking about a disaster where you can't fit a person or a dog \u2014
p117
aVand it's on fire.
p118
aVThe only hope of getting to a survivor way in the basement,
p119
aVyou have to go through things that are on fire.
p120
aVIt was so hot, on one of the robots, the tracks began to melt and come off.
p121
aVRobots don't replace people or dogs,
p122
aVor hummingbirds or hawks or dolphins.
p123
aVThey do things new.
p124
aVThey assist the responders, the experts, in new and innovative ways.
p125
aa(lp126
VThe biggest problem is not making the robots smaller, though.
p127
aVIt's not making them more heat-resistant.
p128
aVIt's not making more sensors.
p129
aVThe biggest problem is the data, the informatics,
p130
aVbecause these people need to get the right data at the right time.
p131
aa(lp132
VSo wouldn't it be great if we could have experts immediately access the robots
p133
aVwithout having to waste any time of driving to the site,
p134
aVso whoever's there, use their robots over the Internet.
p135
aVWell, let's think about that.
p136
aVLet's think about a chemical train derailment in a rural county.
p137
aVWhat are the odds that the experts, your chemical engineer,
p138
aVyour railroad transportation engineers,
p139
aVhave been trained on whatever UAV that particular county happens to have?
p140
aVProbably, like, none.
p141
aVSo we're using these kinds of interfaces
p142
aVto allow people to use the robots without knowing what robot they're using,
p143
aVor even if they're using a robot or not.
p144
aVWhat the robots give you, what they give the experts, is data.
p145
aa(lp146
VThe problem becomes: who gets what data when?
p147
aVOne thing to do is to ship all the information to everybody
p148
aVand let them sort it out.
p149
aVWell, the problem with that is it overwhelms the networks,
p150
aVand worse yet, it overwhelms the cognitive abilities
p151
aVof each of the people trying to get that one nugget of information
p152
aVthey need to make the decision that's going to make the difference.
p153
aVSo we need to think about those kinds of challenges.
p154
aVSo it's the data.
p155
aa(lp156
VGoing back to the World Trade Center,
p157
aVwe tried to solve that problem by just recording the data from Bujold
p158
aVonly when she was deep in the rubble,
p159
aVbecause that's what the USAR team said they wanted.
p160
aVWhat we didn't know at the time
p161
aVwas that the civil engineers would have loved,
p162
aVneeded the data as we recorded the box beams, the serial numbers,
p163
aVthe locations, as we went into the rubble.
p164
aVWe lost valuable data.
p165
aVSo the challenge is getting all the data
p166
aVand getting it to the right people.
p167
aa(lp168
VNow, here's another reason.
p169
aVWe've learned that some buildings \u2014
p170
aVthings like schools, hospitals, city halls \u2014
p171
aVget inspected four times by different agencies
p172
aVthroughout the response phases.
p173
aVNow, we're looking, if we can get the data from the robots to share,
p174
aVnot only can we do things like compress that sequence of phases
p175
aVto shorten the response time,
p176
aVbut now we can begin to do the response in parallel.
p177
aVEverybody can see the data.
p178
aVWe can shorten it that way.
p179
aa(lp180
VSo really, "disaster robotics" is a misnomer.
p181
aVIt's not about the robots.
p182
aVIt's about the data.
p183
aa(lp184
V(Applause)
p185
aa(lp186
VSo my challenge to you:
p187
aVthe next time you hear about a disaster,
p188
aVlook for the robots.
p189
aVThey may be underground, they may be underwater,
p190
aVthey may be in the sky,
p191
aVbut they should be there.
p192
aVLook for the robots,
p193
aVbecause robots are coming to the rescue.
