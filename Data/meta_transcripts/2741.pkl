VI was 14 years old
p4
aVinside of a bowling alley,
p5
aVburglarizing an arcade game,
p6
aVand upon exiting the building
p7
aVa security guard grabbed my arm, so I ran.
p8
aVI ran down the street, and I jumped on top of a fence.
p9
aVAnd when I got to the top,
p10
aVthe weight of 3,000 quarters in my book bag
p11
aVpulled me back down to the ground.
p12
aVSo when I came to, the security guard was standing on top of me,
p13
aVand he said, "Next time you little punks steal something you can carry."
p14
aa(lp15
V(Laughter)
p16
aa(lp17
VI was taken to juvenile hall
p18
aVand when I was released into the custody of my mother,
p19
aVthe first words my uncle said was, "How'd you get caught?"
p20
aVI said, "Man, the book bag was too heavy."
p21
aVHe said, "Man, you weren't supposed to take all the quarters."
p22
aVI said, "Man, they were small. What am I supposed to do?"
p23
aVAnd 10 minutes later, he took me to burglarize another arcade game.
p24
aVWe needed gas money to get home.
p25
aVThat was my life.
p26
aa(lp27
VI grew up in Oakland, California,
p28
aVwith my mother and members of my immediate family
p29
aVaddicted to crack cocaine.
p30
aVMy environment consisted of living with family, friends,
p31
aVand homeless shelters.
p32
aVOftentimes, dinner was served in breadlines and soup kitchens.
p33
aVThe big homey told me this:
p34
aVmoney rules the world
p35
aVand everything in it.
p36
aVAnd in these streets, money is king.
p37
aVAnd if you follow the money,
p38
aVit'll lead you to the bad guy or the good guy.
p39
aa(lp40
VSoon after, I committed my first crime,
p41
aVand it was the first time that I was told that I had potential
p42
aVand felt like somebody believed in me.
p43
aVNobody ever told me that I could be a lawyer,
p44
aVdoctor or engineer.
p45
aVI mean, how was I supposed to do that? I couldn't read, write or spell.
p46
aVI was illiterate.
p47
aVSo I always thought crime was my way to go.
p48
aa(lp49
VAnd then one day
p50
aVI was talking to somebody
p51
aVand he was telling me about this robbery that we could do.
p52
aVAnd we did it.
p53
aa(lp54
VThe reality was that I was growing up
p55
aVin the strongest financial nation in the world,
p56
aVthe United States of America,
p57
aVwhile I watched my mother stand in line at a blood bank
p58
aVto sell her blood for 40 dollars just to try to feed her kids.
p59
aVShe still has the needle marks on her arms to day to show for that.
p60
aa(lp61
VSo I never cared about my community.
p62
aVThey didn't care about my life.
p63
aVEverybody there was doing what they were doing to take what they wanted,
p64
aVthe drug dealers, the robbers, the blood bank.
p65
aVEverybody was taking blood money.
p66
aVSo I got mine by any means necessary.
p67
aVI got mine.
p68
aVFinancial literacy really did rule the world,
p69
aVand I was a child slave to it
p70
aVfollowing the bad guy.
p71
aa(lp72
VAt 17 years old, I was arrested for robbery and murder
p73
aVand I soon learned that finances in prison rule more than they did on the streets,
p74
aVso I wanted in.
p75
aVOne day, I rushed to grab the sports page of the newspaper
p76
aVso my cellie could read it to me,
p77
aVand I accidentally picked up the business section.
p78
aVAnd this old man said, "Hey youngster, you pick stocks?"
p79
aVAnd I said, "What's that?"
p80
aVHe said, "That's the place where white folks keep all their money."
p81
aa(lp82
V(Laughter)
p83
aa(lp84
VAnd it was the first time that I saw a glimpse of hope,
p85
aVa future.
p86
aVHe gave me this brief description of what stocks were,
p87
aVbut it was just a glimpse.
p88
aVI mean, how was I supposed to do it?
p89
aVI couldn't read, write or spell.
p90
aVThe skills that I had developed to hide my illiteracy
p91
aVno longer worked in this environment.
p92
aVI was trapped in a cage, prey among predators,
p93
aVfighting for freedom I never had.
p94
aVI was lost, tired,
p95
aVand I was out of options.
p96
aa(lp97
VSo at 20 years old,
p98
aVI did the hardest thing I'd ever done in my life.
p99
aVI picked up a book,
p100
aVand it was the most agonizing time of my life,
p101
aVtrying to learn how to read,
p102
aVthe ostracizing from my family,
p103
aVthe homeys.
p104
aVIt was rough, man.
p105
aVIt was a struggle.
p106
aVBut little did I know
p107
aVI was receiving the greatest gifts I had ever dreamed of:
p108
aVself-worth,
p109
aVknowledge, discipline.
p110
aVI was so excited to be reading that I read everything I could get my hands on:
p111
aVcandy wrappers, clothing logos, street signs, everything.
p112
aVI was just reading stuff!
p113
aa(lp114
V(Applause)
p115
aa(lp116
VJust reading stuff.
p117
aVI was so excited to know how to read and know how to spell.
p118
aVThe homey came up, said, "Man, what you eating?"
p119
aVI said, "C-A-N-D-Y, candy."
p120
aa(lp121
V(Laughter)
p122
aa(lp123
VHe said, "Let me get some." I said, "N-O. No."
p124
aa(lp125
V(Laughter)
p126
aa(lp127
VIt was awesome.
p128
aVI mean, I can actually now for the first time in my life read.
p129
aVThe feeling that I got from it was amazing.
p130
aa(lp131
VAnd then at 22, feeling myself,
p132
aVfeeling confident,
p133
aVI remembered what the OG told me.
p134
aVSo I picked up the business section of the newspaper.
p135
aVI wanted to find these rich white folks.
p136
aa(lp137
V(Laughter)
p138
aa(lp139
VSo I looked for that glimpse.
p140
aVAs I furthered my career
p141
aVin teaching others how to financially manage money and invest,
p142
aVI soon learned that I had to take responsibility for my own actions.
p143
aVTrue, I grew up in a very complex environment,
p144
aVbut I chose to commit crimes,
p145
aVand I had to own up to that.
p146
aVI had to take responsibility for that, and I did.
p147
aVI was building a curriculum that could teach incarcerated men
p148
aVhow to manage money through prison employments.
p149
aVProperly managing our lifestyle would provide transferrable tools
p150
aVthat we can use to manage money when we reenter society,
p151
aVlike the majority of people did who didn't commit crimes.
p152
aVThen I discovered
p153
aVthat according to MarketWatch,
p154
aVover 60 percent of the American population
p155
aVhas under 1,000 dollars in savings.
p156
aVSports Illustrated said that over 60 percent of NBA players
p157
aVand NFL players go broke.
p158
aV40 percent of marital problems derive from financial issues.
p159
aVWhat the hell?
p160
aa(lp161
V(Laughter)
p162
aa(lp163
VYou mean to tell me that people worked their whole lives,
p164
aVbuying cars, clothes, homes and material stuff
p165
aVbut were living check to check?
p166
aVHow in the world were members of society going to help incarcerated individuals
p167
aVback into society
p168
aVif they couldn't manage they own stuff?
p169
aVWe screwed.
p170
aa(lp171
V(Laughter)
p172
aa(lp173
VI needed a better plan.
p174
aVThis is not going to work out too well.
p175
aVSo ...
p176
aVI thought.
p177
aVI now had an obligation to meet those on the path
p178
aVand help,
p179
aVand it was crazy because I now cared about my community.
p180
aVWow, imagine that. I cared about my community.
p181
aa(lp182
VFinancial illiteracy is a disease
p183
aVthat has crippled minorities and the lower class in our society
p184
aVfor generations and generations,
p185
aVand we should be furious about that.
p186
aVAsk yourselves this:
p187
aVHow can 50 percent of the American population
p188
aVbe financially illiterate in a nation driven by financial prosperity?
p189
aVOur access to justice, our social status,
p190
aVliving conditions, transportation and food
p191
aVare all dependent on money that most people can't manage.
p192
aVIt's crazy!
p193
aVIt's an epidemic
p194
aVand a bigger danger to public safety than any other issue.
p195
aa(lp196
VAccording to the California Department of Corrections,
p197
aVover 70 percent of those incarcerated
p198
aVhave committed or have been charged with money-related crimes:
p199
aVrobberies, burglaries, fraud, larceny, extortion \u2014
p200
aVand the list goes on.
p201
aVCheck this out:
p202
aVa typical incarcerated person
p203
aVwould enter the California prison system
p204
aVwith no financial education,
p205
aVearn 30 cents an hour,
p206
aVover 800 dollars a year,
p207
aVwith no real expenses and save no money.
p208
aVUpon his parole, he will be given 200 dollars gate money and told,
p209
aV"Hey, good luck, stay out of trouble. Don't come back to prison."
p210
aVWith no meaningful preparation or long-term financial plan,
p211
aVwhat does he do ... ?
p212
aVAt 60?
p213
aVGet a good job,
p214
aVor go back to the very criminal behavior that led him to prison in the first place?
p215
aVYou taxpayers, you choose.
p216
aVWell, his education already chose for him, probably.
p217
aa(lp218
VSo how do we cure this disease?
p219
aVI cofounded a program
p220
aVthat we call Financial Empowerment Emotional Literacy.
p221
aVWe call it FEEL,
p222
aVand it teaches how do you separate your emotional decisions
p223
aVfrom your financial decisions,
p224
aVand the four timeless rules to personal finance:
p225
aVthe proper way to save,
p226
aVcontrol your cost of living,
p227
aVborrow money effectively
p228
aVand diversify your finances by allowing your money to work for you
p229
aVinstead of you working for it.
p230
aVIncarcerated people need these life skills before we reenter society.
p231
aVYou can't have full rehabilitation without these life skills.
p232
aVThis idea that only professionals can invest and manage money
p233
aVis absolutely ridiculous,
p234
aVand whoever told you that is lying.
p235
aa(lp236
V(Applause)
p237
aa(lp238
VA professional is a person
p239
aVwho knows his craft better than most,
p240
aVand nobody knows how much money you need, have or want better than you,
p241
aVwhich means you are the professional.
p242
aVFinancial literacy is not a skill, ladies and gentlemen.
p243
aVIt's a lifestyle.
p244
aVFinancial stability is a byproduct of a proper lifestyle.
p245
aVA financially sound incarcerated person can become a taxpaying citizen,
p246
aVand a financially sound taxpaying citizen can remain one.
p247
aVThis allows us to create a bridge between those people who we influence:
p248
aVfamily, friends and those young people
p249
aVwho still believe that crime and money are related.
p250
aVSo let's lose the fear and anxiety
p251
aVof all the big financial words
p252
aVand all that other nonsense that you've been out there hearing.
p253
aVAnd let's get to the heart of what's been crippling our society
p254
aVfrom taking care of your responsibility to be better life managers.
p255
aVAnd let's provide a simple and easy to use curriculum
p256
aVthat gets to the heart, the heart
p257
aVof what financial empowerment and emotional literacy really is.
p258
aa(lp259
VNow, if you're sitting out here in the audience and you said,
p260
aV"Oh yeah, well, that ain't me and I don't buy it,"
p261
aVthen come take my class \u2014
p262
aa(lp263
V(Laughter)
p264
aa(lp265
Vso I can show you how much money it costs you every time you get emotional.
p266
aa(lp267
V(Applause)
p268
aa(lp269
VThank you very much. Thank you.
