VI was a Marine with 1/1 Weapons Company,
p4
aV81's platoon,
p5
aVout in Camp Pendleton, California.
p6
aVOorah!
p7
aa(lp8
VAudience: Oorah!
p9
aa(lp10
V(Laughter)
p11
aa(lp12
VI joined a few months after September 11,
p13
aVfeeling like I think most people in the country did at the time,
p14
aVfilled with a sense of patriotism and retribution
p15
aVand the desire to do something \u2014
p16
aVthat, coupled with that fact that I wasn't doing anything.
p17
aVI was 17, just graduated from high school that past summer,
p18
aVliving in the back room of my parents' house paying rent,
p19
aVin the small town I was raised in in Northern Indiana,
p20
aVcalled Mishawaka.
p21
aVI can spell that later for people who are interested \u2014
p22
aa(lp23
V(Laughter)
p24
aa(lp25
VMishawaka is many good things but cultural hub of the world it is not,
p26
aVso my only exposure to theater and film
p27
aVwas limited to the plays I did in high school
p28
aVand Blockbuster Video, may she rest in peace.
p29
aa(lp30
V(Laughter)
p31
aa(lp32
VI was serious enough about acting
p33
aVthat I auditioned for Juilliard when I was a senior in high school,
p34
aVdidn't get in,
p35
aVdetermined college wasn't for me and applied nowhere else,
p36
aVwhich was a genius move.
p37
aVI also did that Hail Mary LA acting odyssey
p38
aVthat I always heard stories about,
p39
aVof actors moving to LA with, like, seven dollars
p40
aVand finding work and successful careers.
p41
aVI got as far as Amarillo, Texas, before my car broke down.
p42
aVI spent all my money repairing it,
p43
aVfinally made it to Santa Monica \u2014
p44
aVnot even LA \u2014
p45
aVstayed for 48 hours wandering the beach, basically,
p46
aVgot in my car, drove home,
p47
aVthus ending my acting career, so \u2014
p48
aa(lp49
V(Laughter)
p50
aa(lp51
VSeventeen, Mishawaka ...
p52
aVparents' house, paying rent, selling vacuums ...
p53
aVtelemarketing,
p54
aVcutting grass at the local 4-H fairgrounds.
p55
aVThis was my world going into September, 2001.
p56
aa(lp57
VSo after the 11th,
p58
aVand feeling an overwhelming sense of duty,
p59
aVand just being pissed off in general \u2014 at myself,
p60
aVmy parents, the government;
p61
aVnot having confidence, not having a respectable job,
p62
aVmy shitty mini-fridge that I just drove to California and back \u2014
p63
aVI joined the Marine Corps and loved it. I loved being a Marine.
p64
aVIt's one of the things I'm most proud of having done in my life.
p65
aVFiring weapons was cool,
p66
aVdriving and detonating expensive things was great.
p67
aVBut I found I loved the Marine Corps the most
p68
aVfor the thing I was looking for the least when I joined,
p69
aVwhich was the people:
p70
aVthese weird dudes \u2014 a motley crew of characters
p71
aVfrom a cross section of the United States \u2014
p72
aVthat on the surface I had nothing in common with.
p73
aVAnd over time,
p74
aVall the political and personal bravado
p75
aVthat led me to the military dissolved,
p76
aVand for me, the Marine Corps became synonymous with my friends.
p77
aa(lp78
VAnd then, a few years into my service
p79
aVand months away from deploying to Iraq,
p80
aVI dislocated my sternum in a mountain-biking accident,
p81
aVand had to be medically separated.
p82
aVThose never in the military may find this hard to understand,
p83
aVbut being told I wasn't getting deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan
p84
aVwas very devastating for me.
p85
aVI have a very clear image of leaving the base hospital on a stretcher
p86
aVand my entire platoon is waiting outside to see if I was OK.
p87
aa(lp88
VAnd then, suddenly, I was a civilian again.
p89
aVI knew I wanted to give acting another shot,
p90
aVbecause \u2014 again, this is me \u2014
p91
aVI thought all civilian problems are small compared to the military.
p92
aVI mean, what can you really bitch about now, you know?
p93
aV"It's hot.
p94
aVSomeone should turn on the air conditioner."
p95
aV"This coffee line is too long."
p96
aVI was a Marine,
p97
aVI knew how to survive.
p98
aVI'd go to New York and become an actor.
p99
aVIf things didn't work out,
p100
aVI'd live in Central Park and dumpster-dive behind Panera Bread.
p101
aa(lp102
V(Laughter)
p103
aa(lp104
VI re-auditioned for Juilliard and this time I was lucky,
p105
aVI got in.
p106
aVBut I was surprised by how complex the transition was
p107
aVfrom military to civilian.
p108
aVAnd I was relatively healthy; I can't imagine going through that process
p109
aVon top of a mental or physical injury.
p110
aVBut regardless, it was difficult.
p111
aVIn part, because I was in acting school \u2014
p112
aVI couldn't justify going to voice and speech class,
p113
aVthrowing imaginary balls of energy at the back of the room,
p114
aVdoing acting exercises where I gave birth to myself \u2014
p115
aa(lp116
V(Laughter)
p117
aa(lp118
Vwhile my friends were serving without me overseas.
p119
aVBut also, because I didn't know how to apply the things
p120
aVI learned in the military to a civilian context.
p121
aVI mean that both practically and emotionally.
p122
aVPractically, I had to get a job.
p123
aVAnd I was an Infantry Marine,
p124
aVwhere you're shooting machine guns and firing mortars.
p125
aVThere's not a lot of places you can put those skills in the civilian world.
p126
aa(lp127
V(Laughter)
p128
aa(lp129
VEmotionally, I struggled to find meaning.
p130
aVIn the military, everything has meaning.
p131
aVEverything you do is either steeped in tradition
p132
aVor has a practical purpose.
p133
aVYou can't smoke in the field
p134
aVbecause you don't want to give away your position.
p135
aVYou don't touch your face \u2014 you have to maintain
p136
aVa personal level of health and hygiene.
p137
aVYou face this way when "Colors" plays,
p138
aVout of respect for people who went before you.
p139
aVWalk this way, talk this way because of this.
p140
aVYour uniform is maintained to the inch.
p141
aVHow diligently you followed those rules spoke volumes
p142
aVabout the kind of Marine you were.
p143
aVYour rank said something about your history
p144
aVand the respect you had earned.
p145
aa(lp146
VIn the civilian world there's no rank.
p147
aVHere you're just another body,
p148
aVand I felt like I constantly had to prove my worth all over again.
p149
aVAnd the respect civilians were giving me while I was in uniform
p150
aVdidn't exist when I was out of it.
p151
aVThere didn't seem to be a ...
p152
aVa sense of community,
p153
aVwhereas in the military, I felt this sense of community.
p154
aVHow often in the civilian world
p155
aVare you put in a life-or-death situation with your closest friends
p156
aVand they constantly demonstrate that they're not going to abandon you?
p157
aVAnd meanwhile, at acting school ...
p158
aa(lp159
V(Laughter)
p160
aa(lp161
VI was really, for the first time,
p162
aVdiscovering playwrights and characters and plays
p163
aVthat had nothing to do with the military,
p164
aVbut were somehow describing my military experience
p165
aVin a way that before to me was indescribable.
p166
aVAnd I felt myself becoming less aggressive
p167
aVas I was able to put words to feelings for the first time
p168
aVand realizing what a valuable tool that was.
p169
aa(lp170
VAnd when I was reflecting on my time in the military,
p171
aVI wasn't first thinking on the stereotypical drills
p172
aVand discipline and pain of it;
p173
aVbut rather, the small, intimate human moments,
p174
aVmoments of great feeling:
p175
aVfriends going AWOL because they missed their families,
p176
aVfriends getting divorced,
p177
aVgrieving together, celebrating together,
p178
aVall within the backdrop of the military.
p179
aVI saw my friends battling these circumstances,
p180
aVand I watched the anxiety it produced in them and me,
p181
aVnot being able to express our feelings about it.
p182
aa(lp183
VThe military and theater communities are actually very similar.
p184
aVYou have a group of people trying to accomplish a mission
p185
aVgreater than themselves; it's not about you.
p186
aVYou have a role, you have to know your role within that team.
p187
aVEvery team has a leader or director;
p188
aVsometimes they're smart, sometimes they're not.
p189
aVYou're forced to be intimate with complete strangers
p190
aVin a short amount of time;
p191
aVthe self-discipline, the self-maintenance.
p192
aVI thought, how great would it be to create a space
p193
aVthat combined these two seemingly dissimilar communities,
p194
aVthat brought entertainment to a group of people
p195
aVthat, considering their occupation,
p196
aVcould handle something a bit more thought-provoking
p197
aVthan the typical mandatory-fun events
p198
aVthat I remember being "volun-told" to go to in the military \u2014
p199
aa(lp200
V(Laughter)
p201
aa(lp202
Vall well-intended but slightly offensive events,
p203
aVlike "Win a Date with a San Diego Chargers Cheerleader,"
p204
aVwhere you answer a question about pop culture,
p205
aVand if you get it right you win a date,
p206
aVwhich was a chaperoned walk around the parade deck
p207
aVwith this already married, pregnant cheerleader \u2014
p208
aa(lp209
V(Laughter)
p210
aa(lp211
VNothing against cheerleaders, I love cheerleaders.
p212
aVThe point is more, how great would it be to have theater presented
p213
aVthrough characters that were accessible without being condescending.
p214
aVSo we started this nonprofit called Arts in the Armed Forces,
p215
aVwhere we tried to do that,
p216
aVtried to join these two seemingly dissimilar communities.
p217
aVWe pick a play or select monologues from contemporary American plays
p218
aVthat are diverse in age and race like a military audience is,
p219
aVgrab a group of incredible theater-trained actors,
p220
aVarm them with incredible material,
p221
aVkeep production value as minimal as possible \u2014
p222
aVno sets, no costumes, no lights, just reading it \u2014
p223
aVto throw all the emphasis on the language
p224
aVand to show that theater can be created at any setting.
p225
aa(lp226
VIt's a powerful thing,
p227
aVgetting in a room with complete strangers
p228
aVand reminding ourselves of our humanity,
p229
aVand that self-expression is just as valuable a tool
p230
aVas a rifle on your shoulder.
p231
aVAnd for an organization like the military,
p232
aVthat prides itself on having acronyms for acronyms,
p233
aVyou can get lost in the sauce
p234
aVwhen it comes to explaining a collective experience.
p235
aVAnd I can think of no better community
p236
aVto arm with a new means of self-expression
p237
aVthan those protecting our country.
p238
aa(lp239
VWe've gone all over the United States and the world,
p240
aVfrom Walter Reed in Bethesda, Maryland,
p241
aVto Camp Pendleton, to Camp Arifjan in Kuwait,
p242
aVto USAG Bavaria,
p243
aVon- and off-Broadway theaters in New York.
p244
aVAnd for the performing artists we bring,
p245
aVit's a window into a culture
p246
aVthey otherwise would not have had exposure to.
p247
aVAnd for the military, it's the exact same.
p248
aa(lp249
VAnd in doing this for the past six years,
p250
aVI'm always reminded that acting is many things.
p251
aVIt's a craft, it's a political act, it's a business, it's \u2014
p252
aVwhatever adjective is most applicable to you.
p253
aVBut it's also a service.
p254
aVI didn't get to finish mine,
p255
aVso whenever I get to be of service
p256
aVto this ultimate service industry, the military, for me, again \u2014
p257
aVthere's not many things better than that.
p258
aa(lp259
VThank you.
p260
aa(lp261
V(Applause)
p262
aa(lp263
VWe're going to be doing a piece from Marco Ramirez,
p264
aVcalled "I am not Batman."
p265
aVAn incredible actor and good friend of mine, Jesse Perez,
p266
aVis going to be reading,
p267
aVand Matt Johnson, who I just met a couple hours ago.
p268
aVThey're doing it together for the first time,
p269
aVso we'll see how it goes.
p270
aa(lp271
VJesse Perez and Matt Johnson.
p272
aa(lp273
V(Applause)
p274
aa(lp275
VJesse Perez: It's the middle of the night
p276
aVand the sky is glowing like mad, radioactive red.
p277
aVAnd if you squint, you can maybe see the moon
p278
aVthrough a thick layer of cigarette smoke and airplane exhaust
p279
aVthat covers the whole city,
p280
aVlike a mosquito net that won't let the angels in.
p281
aa(lp282
V(Drum beat)
p283
aa(lp284
VAnd if you look up high enough,
p285
aVyou can see me standing on the edge of an 87-story building.
p286
aVAnd up there, a place for gargoyles and broken clock towers
p287
aVthat have stayed still and dead for maybe like 100 years,
p288
aVup there is me.
p289
aa(lp290
V(Beat)
p291
aa(lp292
VAnd I'm frickin' Batman.
p293
aa(lp294
V(Beat)
p295
aa(lp296
VAnd I gots Batmobiles and batarangs
p297
aVand frickin' bat caves, like, for real.
p298
aVAnd all it takes is a broom closet
p299
aVor a back room or a fire escape,
p300
aVand Danny's hand-me-down jeans are gone.
p301
aVAnd my navy blue polo shirt,
p302
aVthe one that looks kinda good on me but has that hole on it near the butt
p303
aVfrom when it got snagged on the chain-link fence behind Arturo's
p304
aVbut it isn't even a big deal because I tuck that part in
p305
aVand it's, like, all good.
p306
aVThat blue polo shirt \u2014 it's gone, too!
p307
aVAnd I get like, like ... transformational.
p308
aa(lp309
V(Beat)
p310
aa(lp311
VAnd nobody pulls out a belt and whips Batman for talkin' back.
p312
aa(lp313
V(Beat)
p314
aa(lp315
VOr for not talkin' back.
p316
aa(lp317
VAnd nobody calls Batman simple
p318
aVor stupid
p319
aVor skinny.
p320
aVAnd nobody fires Batman's brother from the Eastern Taxi Company
p321
aV'cause they was making cutbacks, neither.
p322
aV'Cause they got nothing but respect.
p323
aVAnd not like afraid-respect,
p324
aVjust, like, respect-respect.
p325
aa(lp326
V(Laughter)
p327
aa(lp328
V'Cause nobody's afraid of you.
p329
aV'Cause Batman doesn't mean nobody no harm.
p330
aa(lp331
V(Beat)
p332
aa(lp333
VEver. (Double beat)
p334
aa(lp335
V'Cause all Batman really wants to do is save people
p336
aVand maybe pay abuela's bills one day
p337
aVand die happy.
p338
aVAnd maybe get, like, mad-famous for real.
p339
aa(lp340
V(Laughter)
p341
aa(lp342
VOh \u2014 and kill the Joker.
p343
aa(lp344
V(Drum roll)
p345
aa(lp346
VTonight, like most nights, I'm all alone.
p347
aVAnd I'm watchin' and I'm waitin'
p348
aVlike a eagle
p349
aVor like a \u2014
p350
aVno, yeah, like a eagle.
p351
aa(lp352
V(Laughter)
p353
aa(lp354
VAnd my cape is flapping in the wind cause it's frickin' long
p355
aVand my pointy ears are on,
p356
aVand that mask that covers like half my face is on, too,
p357
aVand I got, like, bulletproof stuff all in my chest so no one can hurt me.
p358
aVAnd nobody \u2014 nobody! \u2014
p359
aVis gonna come between Batman ...
p360
aVand justice.
p361
aa(lp362
V(Drums) (Laughter)
p363
aa(lp364
VFrom where I am,
p365
aVI can hear everything.
p366
aa(lp367
V(Silence)
p368
aa(lp369
VSomewhere in the city,
p370
aVthere's a old lady picking Styrofoam leftovers up out of a trash can
p371
aVand she's putting a piece of sesame chicken someone spit out
p372
aVinto her own mouth.
p373
aVAnd somewhere there's a doctor with a wack haircut in a black lab coat
p374
aVtrying to find a cure for the diseases
p375
aVthat are gonna make us all extinct for real one day.
p376
aVAnd somewhere there's a man,
p377
aVa man in a janitor's uniform,
p378
aVstumbling home drunk and dizzy
p379
aVafter spending half his paycheck on 40-ounce bottles of twist-off beer,
p380
aVand the other half on a four-hour visit to some lady's house
p381
aVon a street where the lights have all been shot out
p382
aVby people who'd rather do what they do in this city in the dark.
p383
aVAnd half a block away from janitor man,
p384
aVthere's a group of good-for-nothings who don't know no better,
p385
aVwaiting for janitor man with rusted bicycle chains
p386
aVand imitation Louisville Sluggers,
p387
aVand if they don't find a cent on him,
p388
aVwhich they won't,
p389
aVthey'll just pound at him till the muscles in their arms start burning,
p390
aVtill there's no more teeth to crack out.
p391
aa(lp392
VBut they don't count on me.
p393
aVThey don't count on no Dark Knight,
p394
aVwith a stomach full of grocery-store brand macaroni and cheese
p395
aVand cut-up Vienna sausages.
p396
aa(lp397
V(Laughter)
p398
aa(lp399
V'Cause they'd rather believe I don't exist.
p400
aa(lp401
VAnd from 87 stories up, I can hear one of the good-for-nothings say,
p402
aV"Gimme the cash!" \u2014 real fast like that,
p403
aVjust, "Gimme me the fuckin' cash!"
p404
aVAnd I see janitor man mumble something in drunk language and turn pale,
p405
aVand from 87 stories up,
p406
aVI can hear his stomach trying to hurl its way out his Dickies.
p407
aa(lp408
VSo I swoop down, like, mad-fast
p409
aVand I'm like darkness, I'm like, "Swoosh!"
p410
aVAnd I throw a batarang at the one naked lightbulb.
p411
aa(lp412
V(Cymbal)
p413
aa(lp414
VAnd they're all like, "Whoa, muthafucker!
p415
aVWho just turned out the lights?"
p416
aa(lp417
V(Laughter)
p418
aa(lp419
V"What's that over there?" "What?"
p420
aa(lp421
V"Gimme me what you got, old man!"
p422
aa(lp423
V"Did anybody hear that?"
p424
aV"Hear what? There ain't nothing. No, really \u2014 there ain't no bat!"
p425
aa(lp426
VBut then ...
p427
aVone out of the three good-for-nothings gets it to the head \u2014 pow!
p428
aa(lp429
VAnd number two swings blindly into the dark cape before him,
p430
aVbut before his fist hits anything,
p431
aVI grab a trash can lid and \u2014
p432
aVright in the gut!
p433
aVAnd number one comes back with the jump kick,
p434
aVbut I know judo karate, too, so I'm like \u2014
p435
aa(lp436
V(Drums)
p437
aa(lp438
VTwice!
p439
aa(lp440
V(Drums)
p441
aa(lp442
V(Laughter)
p443
aa(lp444
V(Drums)
p445
aa(lp446
VBut before I can do any more damage,
p447
aVsuddenly we all hear a "click-click."
p448
aVAnd suddenly everything gets quiet.
p449
aVAnd the one good-for-nothing left standing
p450
aVgrips a handgun and aims it straight up,
p451
aVlike he's holding Jesus hostage,
p452
aVlike he's threatening maybe to blow a hole in the moon.
p453
aVAnd the good-for-nothing who got it to the head,
p454
aVwho tried to jump-kick me,
p455
aVand the other good-for-nothing who got it in the gut,
p456
aVis both scrambling back away from the dark figure before 'em.
p457
aVAnd the drunk man, the janitor man,
p458
aVis huddled in a corner, praying to Saint Anthony
p459
aV'cause that's the only one he could remember.
p460
aa(lp461
V(Double beat)
p462
aVAnd there's me:
p463
aVeyes glowing white,
p464
aVcape blowing softly in the wind.
p465
aa(lp466
V(Beat)
p467
aVBulletproof chest heaving,
p468
aVmy heart beating right through it in a Morse code for:
p469
aV"Fuck with me
p470
aVjust once
p471
aVcome on
p472
aVjust try."
p473
aa(lp474
VAnd the one good-for-nothing left standing,
p475
aVthe one with the handgun \u2014
p476
aVyeah, he laughs.
p477
aVAnd he lowers his arm.
p478
aVAnd he points it at me
p479
aVand gives the moon a break.
p480
aVAnd he aims it right between my pointy ears,
p481
aVlike goal posts and he's special teams.
p482
aVAnd janitor man is still calling Saint Anthony,
p483
aVbut he ain't pickin' up.
p484
aVAnd for a second,
p485
aVit seems like ...
p486
aVmaybe I'm gonna lose.

aa(lp500
VAnd he's on the floor
p501
aVand I'm standing over him
p502
aVand I got the gun in my hands now
p503
aVand I hate guns, I hate holding 'em 'cause I'm Batman.
p504
aVAnd, asterisk:
p505
aVBatman don't like guns 'cause his parents got iced by guns a long time ago.
p506
aVBut for just a second,
p507
aVmy eyes glow white,
p508
aVand I hold this thing
p509
aVfor I could speak to the good-for-nothing
p510
aVin a language he maybe understands.
p511
aVClick-click!
p512
aa(lp513

p514
aa(lp515
VAnd the good-for-nothings become good-for-disappearing
p516
aVinto whatever toxic waste, chemical sludge shithole they crawled out of.
p517
aVAnd it's just me and janitor man.
p518
aVAnd I pick him up,
p519
aVand I wipe sweat and cheap perfume off his forehead.
p520
aVAnd he begs me not to hurt him
p521
aVand I grab him tight by his janitor-man shirt collar,
p522
aVand I pull him to my face
p523
aVand he's taller than me but the cape helps,
p524
aVso he listens when I look him straight in the eyes.
p525
aVAnd I say two words to him:
p526
aV"Go home."
p527
aa(lp528
VAnd he does,
p529
aVchecking behind his shoulder every 10 feet.
p530
aVAnd I swoosh from building to building on his way there
p531
aV'cause I know where he lives.
p532
aVAnd I watch his hands tremble as he pulls out his key chain
p533
aVand opens the door to his building.
p534
aVAnd I'm back in bed
p535
aVbefore he even walks in through the front door.
p536
aa(lp537
VAnd I hear him turn on the faucet
p538
aVand pour himself a glass of warm tap water.
p539
aVAnd he puts the glass back in the sink.
p540
aVAnd I hear his footsteps.
p541
aVAnd they get slower as they get to my room.
p542
aVAnd he creaks my door open, like, mad-slow.
p543
aVAnd he takes a step in,
p544
aVwhich he never does.
p545
aa(lp546
V(Beat)
p547
aVAnd he's staring off into nowhere,
p548
aVhis face, the color of sidewalks in summer.
p549
aVAnd I act like I'm just waking up
p550
aVand I say, "Ah, what's up, Pop?"
p551
aVAnd janitor man says nothing to me.
p552
aVBut I see in the dark,
p553
aVI see his arms go limp
p554
aVand his head turns back, like, towards me.
p555
aVAnd he lifts it for I can see his face,
p556
aVfor I could see his eyes.
p557
aVAnd his cheeks is drippin', but not with sweat.
p558
aVAnd he just stands there breathing,
p559
aVlike he remembers my eyes glowing white,
p560
aVlike he remembers my bulletproof chest,
p561
aVlike he remembers he's my pop.
p562
aVAnd for a long time I don't say nothin'.
p563
aVAnd he turns around, hand on the doorknob.
p564
aVAnd he ain't looking my way,
p565
aVbut I hear him mumble two words to me:
p566
aV"I'm sorry."
p567
aa(lp568
VAnd I lean over, and I open my window just a crack.
p569
aVIf you look up high enough,
p570
aVyou could see me.
p571
aVAnd from where I am \u2014
