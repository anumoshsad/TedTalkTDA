VToday I'm going to speak to you
p4
aVabout the last 30 years of architectural history.
p5
aVThat's a lot to pack into 18 minutes.
p6
aa(lp7
VIt's a complex topic,
p8
aVso we're just going to dive right in at a complex place:
p9
aVNew Jersey.
p10
aVBecause 30 years ago, I'm from Jersey,
p11
aVand I was six, and I lived there in my parents' house
p12
aVin a town called Livingston,
p13
aVand this was my childhood bedroom.
p14
aVAround the corner from my bedroom
p15
aVwas the bathroom that I used to share with my sister.
p16
aVAnd in between my bedroom and the bathroom
p17
aVwas a balcony that overlooked the family room.
p18
aVAnd that's where everyone would hang out and watch TV,
p19
aVso that every time that I walked from my bedroom to the bathroom,
p20
aVeveryone would see me,
p21
aVand every time I took a shower and would come back in a towel,
p22
aVeveryone would see me.
p23
aVAnd I looked like this.
p24
aVI was awkward,
p25
aVinsecure, and I hated it.
p26
aVI hated that walk, I hated that balcony,
p27
aVI hated that room, and I hated that house.
p28
aa(lp29
VAnd that's architecture.
p30
aV(Laughter)
p31
aVDone.
p32
aVThat feeling, those emotions that I felt,
p33
aVthat's the power of architecture,
p34
aVbecause architecture is not about math and it's not about zoning,
p35
aVit's about those visceral, emotional connections
p36
aVthat we feel to the places that we occupy.
p37
aVAnd it's no surprise that we feel that way,
p38
aVbecause according to the EPA,
p39
aVAmericans spend 90 percent of their time indoors.
p40
aVThat's 90 percent of our time surrounded by architecture.
p41
aVThat's huge.
p42
aVThat means that architecture is shaping us in ways that we didn't even realize.
p43
aa(lp44
VThat makes us a little bit gullible and very, very predictable.
p45
aVIt means that when I show you a building like this,
p46
aVI know what you think:
p47
aVYou think "power" and "stability" and "democracy."
p48
aVAnd I know you think that because it's based on a building
p49
aVthat was build 2,500 years ago by the Greeks.
p50
aVThis is a trick.
p51
aVThis is a trigger that architects use
p52
aVto get you to create an emotional connection
p53
aVto the forms that we build our buildings out of.
p54
aVIt's a predictable emotional connection,
p55
aVand we've been using this trick for a long, long time.
p56
aVWe used it [200] years ago to build banks.
p57
aVWe used it in the 19th century to build art museums.
p58
aVAnd in the 20th century in America,
p59
aVwe used it to build houses.
p60
aVAnd look at these solid, stable little soldiers
p61
aVfacing the ocean and keeping away the elements.
p62
aa(lp63
VThis is really, really useful,
p64
aVbecause building things is terrifying.
p65
aVIt's expensive, it takes a long time, and it's very complicated.
p66
aVAnd the people that build things \u2014
p67
aVdevelopers and governments \u2014
p68
aVthey're naturally afraid of innovation,
p69
aVand they'd rather just use those forms that they know you'll respond to.
p70
aa(lp71
VThat's how we end up with buildings like this.
p72
aVThis is a nice building.
p73
aVThis is the Livingston Public Library
p74
aVthat was completed in 2004 in my hometown,
p75
aVand, you know, it's got a dome
p76
aVand it's got this round thing  and columns, red brick,
p77
aVand you can kind of guess what Livingston is trying to say with this building:
p78
aVchildren, property values and history.
p79
aVBut it doesn't have much to do with what a library actually does today.
p80
aVThat same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country,
p81
aVanother library was completed,
p82
aVand it looks like this.
p83
aVIt's in Seattle.
p84
aVThis library is about how we consume media in a digital age.
p85
aVIt's about a new kind of public amenity for the city,
p86
aVa place to gather and read and share.
p87
aa(lp88
VSo how is it possible
p89
aVthat in the same year, in the same country,
p90
aVtwo buildings, both called libraries,
p91
aVlook so completely different?
p92
aVAnd the answer is that architecture works on the principle of a pendulum.
p93
aVOn the one side is innovation,
p94
aVand architects are constantly pushing, pushing for new technologies,
p95
aVnew typologies, new solutions for the way that we live today.
p96
aVAnd we push and we push and we push
p97
aVuntil we completely alienate all of you.
p98
aVWe wear all black, we get very depressed,
p99
aVyou think we're adorable,
p100
aVwe're dead inside because we've got no choice.
p101
aVWe have to go to the other side
p102
aVand reengage those symbols that we know you love.
p103
aVSo we do that, and you're happy,
p104
aVwe feel like sellouts,
p105
aVso we start experimenting again
p106
aVand we push the pendulum back and back and forth and back and forth
p107
aVwe've gone for the last 300 years,
p108
aVand certainly for the last 30 years.
p109
aa(lp110
VOkay, 30 years ago we were coming out of the '70s.
p111
aVArchitects had been busy experimenting with something called brutalism.
p112
aVIt's about concrete.
p113
aV(Laughter)
p114
aVYou can guess this.
p115
aVSmall windows, dehumanizing scale.
p116
aVThis is really tough stuff.
p117
aVSo as we get closer to the '80s,
p118
aVwe start to reengage those symbols.
p119
aVWe push the pendulum back into the other direction.
p120
aVWe take these forms that we know you love
p121
aVand we update them.
p122
aVWe add neon
p123
aVand we add pastels
p124
aVand we use new materials.
p125
aVAnd you love it.
p126
aVAnd we can't give you enough of it.
p127
aVWe take Chippendale armoires
p128
aVand we turned those into skyscrapers,
p129
aVand skyscrapers can be medieval castles made out of glass.
p130
aVForms got big,
p131
aVforms got bold and colorful.
p132
aVDwarves became columns.
p133
aV(Laughter)
p134
aVSwans grew to the size of buildings.
p135
aVIt was crazy.
p136
aVBut it's the '80s, it's cool.
p137
aV(Laughter)
p138
aVWe're all hanging out in malls
p139
aVand we're all moving to the suburbs,
p140
aVand out there, out in the suburbs,
p141
aVwe can create our own architectural fantasies.
p142
aVAnd those fantasies,
p143
aVthey can be Mediterranean
p144
aVor French
p145
aVor Italian.
p146
aV(Laughter)
p147
aVPossibly with endless breadsticks.
p148
aa(lp149
VThis is the thing about postmodernism.
p150
aVThis is the thing about symbols.
p151
aVThey're easy, they're cheap,
p152
aVbecause instead of making places,
p153
aVwe're making memories of places.
p154
aVBecause I know,  and I know all of you know,
p155
aVthis isn't Tuscany.
p156
aVThis is Ohio.
p157
aV(Laughter)
p158
aa(lp159
VSo architects get frustrated,
p160
aVand we start pushing the pendulum back into the other direction.
p161
aVIn the late '80s and early '90s,
p162
aVwe start experimenting with something called deconstructivism.
p163
aVWe throw out historical symbols,
p164
aVwe rely on new, computer-aided design techniques,
p165
aVand we come up with new compositions,
p166
aVforms crashing into forms.
p167
aVThis is academic and heady stuff,
p168
aVit's super unpopular,
p169
aVwe totally alienate you.
p170
aVOrdinarily, the pendulum would just swing back into the other direction.
p171
aVAnd then, something amazing happened.
p172
aa(lp173
VIn 1997, this building opened.
p174
aVThis is the Guggenheim Bilbao, by Frank Gehry.
p175
aVAnd this building
p176
aVfundamentally changes the world's relationship to architecture.
p177
aVPaul Goldberger said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments
p178
aVwhen critics, academics, and the general public
p179
aVwere completely united around a building.
p180
aVThe New York Times called this building a miracle.
p181
aVTourism in Bilbao increased 2,500 percent
p182
aVafter this building was completed.
p183
aVSo all of a sudden, everybody wants one of these buildings:
p184
aVL.A.,
p185
aVSeattle,
p186
aVChicago,
p187
aVNew York,
p188
aVCleveland,
p189
aVSpringfield.
p190
aV(Laughter)
p191
aVEverybody wants one, and Gehry is everywhere.
p192
aVHe is our very first starchitect.
p193
aa(lp194
VNow, how is it possible that these forms \u2014
p195
aVthey're wild and radical \u2014
p196
aVhow is it possible that they become so ubiquitous throughout the world?
p197
aVAnd it happened because media so successfully galvanized around them
p198
aVthat they quickly taught us that these forms mean culture and tourism.
p199
aVWe created an emotional reaction to these forms.
p200
aVSo did every mayor in the world.
p201
aVSo every mayor knew that if they had these forms,
p202
aVthey had culture and tourism.
p203
aa(lp204
VThis phenomenon at the turn of the new millennium
p205
aVhappened to a few other starchitects.
p206
aVIt happened to Zaha
p207
aVand it happened to Libeskind,
p208
aVand what happened to these elite few architects
p209
aVat the turn of the new millennium
p210
aVcould actually start to happen to the entire field of architecture,
p211
aVas digital media starts to increase the speed
p212
aVwith which we consume information.
p213
aVBecause think about how you consume architecture.
p214
aVA thousand years ago,
p215
aVyou would have had to have walked to the village next door to see a building.
p216
aVTransportation speeds up:
p217
aVYou can take a boat, you can take a plane, you can be a tourist.
p218
aVTechnology speeds up: You can see it in a newspaper, on TV,
p219
aVuntil finally, we are all architectural photographers,
p220
aVand the building has become disembodied from the site.
p221
aVArchitecture is everywhere now,
p222
aVand that means that the speed of communication
p223
aVhas finally caught up to the speed of architecture.
p224
aa(lp225
VBecause architecture actually moves quite quickly.
p226
aVIt doesn't take long to think about a building.
p227
aVIt takes a long time to build a building,
p228
aVthree or four years,
p229
aVand in the interim, an architect will design two or eight
p230
aVor a hundred other buildings
p231
aVbefore they know if that building that they designed four years ago
p232
aVwas a success or not.
p233
aVThat's because there's never been a good feedback loop in architecture.
p234
aVThat's how we end up with buildings like this.
p235
aVBrutalism wasn't a two-year movement,
p236
aVit was a 20-year movement.
p237
aVFor 20 years, we were producing buildings like this
p238
aVbecause we had no idea how much you hated it.
p239
aVIt's never going to happen again,
p240
aVI think,
p241
aVbecause we are living on the verge of the greatest revolution in architecture
p242
aVsince the invention of concrete,
p243
aVof steel, or of the elevator,
p244
aVand it's a media revolution.
p245
aa(lp246
VSo my theory is that when you apply media to this pendulum,
p247
aVit starts swinging faster and faster,
p248
aVuntil it's at both extremes nearly simultaneously,
p249
aVand that effectively blurs the difference between innovation and symbol,
p250
aVbetween us, the architects, and you, the public.
p251
aVNow we can make nearly instantaneous, emotionally charged symbols
p252
aVout of something that's brand new.
p253
aa(lp254
VLet me show you how this plays out
p255
aVin a project that my firm recently completed.
p256
aVWe were hired to replace this building, which burned down.
p257
aVThis is the center of a town called the Pines
p258
aVin Fire Island in New York State.
p259
aVIt's a vacation community.
p260
aVWe proposed a building that was audacious,
p261
aVthat was different than any of the forms that the community was used to,
p262
aVand we were scared and our client was scared
p263
aVand the community was scared,
p264
aVso we created a series of photorealistic renderings
p265
aVthat we put onto Facebook
p266
aVand we put onto Instagram,
p267
aVand we let people start to do what they do:
p268
aVshare it, comment, like it, hate it.
p269
aVBut that meant that two years before the building was complete,
p270
aVit was already a part of the community,
p271
aVso that when the renderings looked exactly like the finished product,
p272
aVthere were no surprises.
p273
aVThis building was already a part of this community,
p274
aVand then that first summer,
p275
aVwhen people started arriving and sharing the building on social media,
p276
aVthe building ceased to be just an edifice and it became media,
p277
aVbecause these, these are not just pictures of a building,
p278
aVthey're your pictures of a building.
p279
aVAnd as you use them to tell your story,
p280
aVthey become part of your personal narrative,
p281
aVand what you're doing is you're short-circuiting
p282
aVall of our collective memory,
p283
aVand you're making these charged symbols for us to understand.
p284
aVThat means we don't need the Greeks anymore
p285
aVto tell us what to think about architecture.
p286
aVWe can tell each other what we think about architecture,
p287
aVbecause digital media hasn't just changed the relationship between all of us,
p288
aVit's changed the relationship between us and buildings.
p289
aVThink for a second about those librarians back in Livingston.
p290
aVIf that building was going to be built today,
p291
aVthe first thing they would do is go online and search "new libraries."
p292
aVThey would be bombarded by examples of experimentation, of innovation,
p293
aVof pushing at the envelope of what a library can be.
p294
aVThat's ammunition.
p295
aVThat's ammunition that they can take with them
p296
aVto the mayor of Livingston, to the people of Livingston,
p297
aVand say, there's no one answer to what a library is today.
p298
aVLet's be a part of this.
p299
aVThis abundance of experimentation
p300
aVgives them the freedom to run their own experiment.
p301
aa(lp302
VEverything is different now.
p303
aVArchitects are no longer these mysterious creatures
p304
aVthat use big words and complicated drawings,
p305
aVand you aren't the hapless public,
p306
aVthe consumer that won't accept anything that they haven't seen anymore.
p307
aVArchitects can hear you,
p308
aVand you're not intimidated by architecture.
p309
aVThat means that that pendulum swinging back and forth
p310
aVfrom style to style, from movement to movement,
p311
aVis irrelevant.
p312
aVWe can actually move forward
p313
aVand find relevant solutions to the problems that our society faces.
p314
aVThis is the end of architectural history,
p315
aVand it means that the buildings of tomorrow
p316
aVare going to look a lot different than the buildings of today.
p317
aVIt means that a public space in the ancient city of Seville
p318
aVcan be unique and tailored to the way that a modern city works.
p319
aVIt means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be a stadium in Brooklyn,
p320
aVnot some red-brick historical pastiche
p321
aVof what we think a stadium ought to be.
p322
aVIt means that robots are going to build our buildings,
p323
aVbecause we're finally ready for the forms that they're going to produce.
p324
aVAnd it means that buildings will twist to the whims of nature
p325
aVinstead of the other way around.
p326
aVIt means that a parking garage in Miami Beach, Florida,
p327
aVcan also be a place for sports
p328
aVand for yoga
p329
aVand you can even get married there late at night.
p330
aV(Laughter)
p331
aVIt means that three architects can dream about swimming
p332
aVin the East River of New York,
p333
aVand then raise nearly half a million dollars
p334
aVfrom a community that gathered around their cause,
p335
aVno one client anymore.
p336
aVIt means that no building is too small for innovation,
p337
aVlike this little reindeer pavilion
p338
aVthat's as muscly and sinewy as the animals it's designed to observe.
p339
aVAnd it means that a building doesn't have to be beautiful
p340
aVto be lovable,
p341
aVlike this ugly little building in Spain,
p342
aVwhere the architects dug a hole,
p343
aVpacked it with hay,
p344
aVand then poured concrete around it,
p345
aVand when the concrete dried,
p346
aVthey invited someone to come and clean that hay out
p347
aVso that all that's left when it's done
p348
aVis this hideous little room
p349
aVthat's filled with the imprints and scratches of how that place was made,
p350
aVand that becomes the most sublime place to watch a Spanish sunset.
p351
aa(lp352
VBecause it doesn't matter if a cow builds our buildings
p353
aVor a robot builds our buildings.
p354
aVIt doesn't matter how we build, it matters what we build.
p355
aVArchitects already know how to make buildings that are greener
p356
aVand smarter and friendlier.
p357
aVWe've just been waiting for all of you to want them.
p358
aVAnd finally, we're not on opposite sides anymore.
p359
aVFind an architect, hire an architect,
p360
aVwork with us to design better buildings, better cities, and a better world,
p361
aVbecause the stakes are high.
p362
aVBuildings don't just reflect our society, they shape our society
p363
aVdown to the smallest spaces:
p364
aVthe local libraries,
p365
aVthe homes where we raise our children,
p366
aVand the walk that they take from the bedroom to the bathroom.
