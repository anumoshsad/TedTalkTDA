VThe first time
p4
aVI felt fear
p5
aVI was 41 years old.
p6
aVPeople have always said I was brave.
p7
aVWhen I was little, I'd climb the highest tree,
p8
aVand I'd approach any animal fearlessly.
p9
aVI liked challenges.
p10
aVMy father used to say,
p11
aV"Good steel can withstand any temperature."
p12
aa(lp13
VAnd when I entered into Colombian politics,
p14
aVI thought I'd be able to withstand any temperature.
p15
aVI wanted to end corruption;
p16
aVI wanted to cut ties between politicians and drug traffickers.
p17
aVThe first time I was elected,
p18
aVit was because I called out, by name,
p19
aVcorrupt and untouchable politicians.
p20
aVI also called out the president
p21
aVfor his ties to the cartels.
p22
aa(lp23
VThat's when the threats started.
p24
aVI had to send my very young children out of the country one morning,
p25
aVhidden, all the way to the airport, in the French ambassador's armored car.
p26
aVDays later,
p27
aVI was the victim of an attack, but emerged unharmed.
p28
aVThe following year,
p29
aVthe Colombian people elected me with the highest number of votes.
p30
aVI thought people applauded me because I was brave.
p31
aVI, too, thought I was brave.
p32
aVBut I wasn't.
p33
aVI had simply never before experienced
p34
aVtrue fear.
p35
aa(lp36
VThat changed
p37
aVon February 23, 2002.
p38
aVAt the time, I was a presidential candidate in Colombia
p39
aVpromoting my campaign agenda,
p40
aVwhen I was detained by a group of armed men.
p41
aVThey were wearing uniforms with military garments.
p42
aVI looked at their boots; they were rubber.
p43
aVAnd I knew
p44
aVthat the Colombian army wore leather boots.
p45
aVI knew that these were FARC guerrillas.
p46
aa(lp47
VFrom that point on, everything happened very quickly.
p48
aVThe commando leader ordered us to stop the vehicle.
p49
aVMeanwhile, one of his men stepped on an antipersonnel mine
p50
aVand flew through the air.
p51
aVHe landed, sitting upright,
p52
aVright in front of me.
p53
aVWe made eye contact
p54
aVand it was then that the young man understood:
p55
aVhis rubber boot with his leg still in it
p56
aVhad landed far away.
p57
aa(lp58
V(Sighs)
p59
aa(lp60
VHe started
p61
aVscreaming like crazy.
p62
aVAnd the truth is,
p63
aVI felt \u2014 as I feel right now, because I'm reliving these emotions \u2014
p64
aVI felt at that moment that something inside of me was breaking
p65
aVand that I was being infected with his fear.
p66
aVMy mind went blank and couldn't think;
p67
aVit was paralyzed.
p68
aVWhen I finally reacted,
p69
aVI said to myself,
p70
aV"They're going to kill me,
p71
aVand I didn't say goodbye to my children."
p72
aVAs they took me into the deepest depths of the jungle,
p73
aVthe FARC soldiers announced
p74
aVthat if the government didn't negotiate,
p75
aVthey'd kill me.
p76
aVAnd I knew
p77
aVthat the government wouldn't negotiate.
p78
aa(lp79
VFrom that point on,
p80
aVI went to sleep in fear every night \u2014
p81
aVcold sweats,
p82
aVshaking,
p83
aVstomach ache,
p84
aVinsomnia.
p85
aVBut worse than that was what was happening to my mind,
p86
aVbecause my memory was being erased: all the phone numbers,
p87
aVaddresses,
p88
aVnames of very dear people,
p89
aVeven significant life events.
p90
aVAnd so,
p91
aVI began to doubt myself, to doubt my mental health.
p92
aVAnd with doubt came desperation,
p93
aVand with desperation came depression.
p94
aVI was suffering notorious behavioral changes
p95
aVand it wasn't just paranoia in moments of panic.
p96
aVIt was distrust,
p97
aVit was hatred,
p98
aVand it was also the urge to kill.
p99
aa(lp100
VThis, I realized
p101
aVwhen they had me chained by the neck to a tree.
p102
aVThey kept me outside that day,
p103
aVduring a tropical downpour.
p104
aVI remember feeling an urgent need to use the bathroom.
p105
aV"Whatever you have to do,
p106
aVyou'll do in front of me,
p107
aVbitch,"
p108
aVthe guard screamed at me.
p109
aVAnd I
p110
aVdecided at that moment
p111
aVto kill him.
p112
aVAnd for days,
p113
aVI was planning, trying to find the right moment, the right way to do it,
p114
aVfilled with hatred,
p115
aVfilled with fear.
p116
aVThen suddenly,
p117
aVI rose up,
p118
aVsnapped out of it
p119
aVand thought:
p120
aV"I'm not going to become one of them.
p121
aVI'm not going to become an assassin.
p122
aVI still have enough freedom
p123
aVto decide
p124
aVwho I want to be."
p125
aa(lp126
VThat's when I learned that fear
p127
aVbrought me face to face with myself.
p128
aVIt forced me
p129
aVto align my energies,
p130
aVto align my meridians.
p131
aVI learned that facing fear
p132
aVcould become a pathway to growth.
p133
aVA lot of emotions arise when I talk about all of this,
p134
aVbut when I think back,
p135
aVI'm able to identify
p136
aVthe steps I took to do it.
p137
aVI want to share three of them with you.
p138
aa(lp139
VThe first
p140
aVwas to be guided by principles.
p141
aVBecause I realized
p142
aVthat in the midst of panic and mental block,
p143
aVif I followed my principles,
p144
aVI acted correctly.
p145
aa(lp146
VI remember the first night
p147
aVin a concentration camp that the guerrillas had built
p148
aVin the middle of the jungle,
p149
aVwith 12-foot-high bars,
p150
aVbarbed wire,
p151
aVlookouts in the four corners
p152
aVand armed men pointing guns at us 24 hours a day.
p153
aVThat morning, the first morning,
p154
aVsome men arrived, yelling:
p155
aV"Count off! Count off!"
p156
aVMy fellow hostages woke up, startled,
p157
aVand began to identify themselves in numbered sequence.
p158
aVBut when it was my turn,
p159
aVI said,
p160
aV"Ingrid Betancourt.
p161
aVIf you want to know if I'm here, call me by my name."
p162
aa(lp163
VThe guards' fury
p164
aVwas nothing compared to that of the other hostages,
p165
aVbecause, obviously they were scared \u2014
p166
aVwe were all scared \u2014
p167
aVand they were afraid that, because of me, they would be punished.
p168
aVBut for me,
p169
aVbeyond fear was the need to defend my identity,
p170
aVto not let them turn me into a thing or a number.
p171
aVThat was one of the principles:
p172
aVto defend
p173
aVwhat I considered to be human dignity.
p174
aa(lp175
VBut make no mistake:
p176
aVthe guerrillas had it all
p177
aVvery well analyzed \u2014
p178
aVthey had been kidnapping for years,
p179
aVand they had developed a technique
p180
aVto break us,
p181
aVto defeat us, to divide us.
p182
aVAnd so,
p183
aVthe second step
p184
aVwas to learn how to build supportive trust,
p185
aVto learn how to unite.
p186
aa(lp187
VThe jungle is like a different planet.
p188
aVIt's a world
p189
aVof shadows, of rain,
p190
aVwith the hum of millions of bugs \u2014
p191
aVmajiña ants, bullet ants.
p192
aVI didn't stop scratching a single day while I was in the jungle.
p193
aVAnd of course, there were tarantulas, scorpions, anacondas ...
p194
aVI once came face to face with a 24-foot long anaconda
p195
aVthat could have swallowed me in one bite.
p196
aVJaguars ...
p197
aa(lp198
VBut I want to tell you
p199
aVthat none of these animals did us as much harm
p200
aVas the human beings.
p201
aVThe guerrillas terrorized us.
p202
aVThey spread rumors.
p203
aVAmong the hostages, they sparked betrayals,
p204
aVjealousy,
p205
aVresentment,
p206
aVmistrust.
p207
aa(lp208
VThe first time I escaped for a long time was with Lucho.
p209
aVLucho had been a hostage for two years longer than I had.
p210
aVWe decided to tie ourselves up
p211
aVwith ropes
p212
aVto have the strength to lower ourselves into that dark water
p213
aVfull of piranhas and alligators.
p214
aVWhat we did was, during the day, we would hide in the mangroves.
p215
aVAnd at night,
p216
aVwe would leave, get in the water,
p217
aVand we would swim and let the current carry us.
p218
aVThat went on for several days.
p219
aVBut Lucho
p220
aVbecame sick.
p221
aVHe was diabetic,
p222
aVand he fell into a diabetic coma.
p223
aVSo the guerrillas captured us.
p224
aa(lp225
VBut after having lived through that with Lucho,
p226
aVafter having faced fear together, united,
p227
aVnot punishment, not violence \u2014 nothing \u2014
p228
aVcould ever again divide us.
p229
aVWhat's certain is,
p230
aVall the guerrillas' manipulation was so damaging to us
p231
aVthat even today,
p232
aVamong some of the hostages
p233
aVfrom back then,
p234
aVtensions linger,
p235
aVpassed down from all that poison
p236
aVthat the guerrillas created.
p237
aa(lp238
VThe third step
p239
aVis very important to me,
p240
aVand it's a gift that I want to give to you.
p241
aVThe third step is to learn how to develop faith.
p242
aVI want to explain it like this:
p243
aVJhon Frank Pinchao
p244
aVwas a police officer
p245
aVwho had been a hostage for more than eight years.
p246
aVHe was famous for being the biggest scaredy-cat of us all.
p247
aVBut Pincho \u2014 I called him "Pincho" \u2014
p248
aVPincho decided that he wanted to escape.
p249
aVAnd he asked me to help him.
p250
aVBy that point, I basically had a master's degree in escape attempts.
p251
aa(lp252
V(Laughter)
p253
aa(lp254
VSo
p255
aVwe got started but we had a delay,
p256
aVbecause first, Pincho had to learn how to swim.
p257
aVAnd we had to carry out all these preparations in total secrecy.
p258
aVAnyway, when we finally had everything ready,
p259
aVPincho came up to me one afternoon and said,
p260
aa(lp261
V"Ingrid, suppose I'm in the jungle,
p262
aVand I go around and around in circles, and I can't find the way out.
p263
aVWhat do I do?"
p264
aa(lp265
V"Pincho,
p266
aVyou grab a phone,
p267
aVand you call the man upstairs."
p268
aa(lp269
V"Ingrid, you know I don't believe in God."
p270
aV"God doesn't care. He'll still help you."
p271
aa(lp272
V(Applause)
p273
aa(lp274
VIt rained all night that night.
p275
aVThe following morning,
p276
aVthe camp woke up to a big commotion,
p277
aVbecause Pincho had fled.
p278
aVThey made us dismantle the camp, and we started marching.
p279
aVDuring the march,
p280
aVthe head guerrillas told us that Pincho had died,
p281
aVand that they had found his remains
p282
aVeaten by an anaconda.
p283
aVSeventeen days passed \u2014
p284
aVand believe me, I counted them, because they were torture for me.
p285
aVBut on the seventeenth day,
p286
aVthe news exploded from the radio:
p287
aVPincho was free and obviously alive.
p288
aVAnd this was the first thing he said:
p289
aa(lp290
V"I know my fellow hostages are listening.
p291
aVIngrid,
p292
aVI did what you told me.
p293
aVI called the man upstairs,
p294
aVand he sent me the patrol that rescued me from the jungle."
p295
aa(lp296
VThat was an extraordinary moment,
p297
aVbecause ...
p298
aVobviously fear is contagious.
p299
aVBut faith is, too.
p300
aVFaith isn't rational or emotional.
p301
aVFaith
p302
aVis an exercise of the will.
p303
aVIt's the discipline of the will.
p304
aVIt's what allows us to transform everything that we are \u2014
p305
aVour weaknesses, our frailties,
p306
aVinto strength, into power.
p307
aVIt's truly a transformation.
p308
aVIt's what gives us the strength
p309
aVto stand up
p310
aVin the face of fear
p311
aVlook above it,
p312
aVand see beyond it.
p313
aVI hope you remember that,
p314
aVbecause I know we all need
p315
aVto connect with that strength we have inside of us
p316
aVfor the times when there's a storm raging around our boat.
p317
aa(lp318
VMany, many, many, many years passed
p319
aVbefore I could return to my house.
p320
aVBut when they took us, handcuffed, into the helicopter
p321
aVthat finally took us out of the jungle,
p322
aVeverything happened as quickly as when they kidnapped me.
p323
aVIn an instant,
p324
aVI saw the guerrilla commander at my feet,
p325
aVgagged,
p326
aVand the rescue leader,
p327
aVyelling:
p328
aa(lp329
V"We're the Colombian army!
p330
aVYou are free!"
p331
aa(lp332
VThe shriek
p333
aVthat came out of all of us
p334
aVwhen we regained our freedom,
p335
aVcontinues to vibrate in me to this day.
p336
aa(lp337
VNow,
p338
aVI know they can divide all of us,
p339
aVthey can manipulate us all with fear.
p340
aVThe "No" vote on the peace referendum in Colombia;
p341
aVBrexit;
p342
aVthe idea of a wall between Mexico and the United States;
p343
aVIslamic terrorism \u2014
p344
aVthey're all examples of using fear politically
p345
aVto divide and recruit us.
p346
aVWe all feel fear.
p347
aVBut we can all avoid being recruited
p348
aVusing the resources we have \u2014 our principles, unity, faith.
p349
aVYes, fear is part of the human condition,
p350
aVas well as being necessary for survival.
p351
aVBut above all,
p352
aVit's the guide by which each of us builds
p353
aVour identity, our personality.
p354
aa(lp355
VIt's true, I was 41 years old the first time I felt fear,
p356
aVand feeling fear was not my decision.
p357
aVBut it was my decision what to do with that fear.
p358
aVYou can survive
p359
aVcrawling along, fearful.
p360
aVBut you can also
p361
aVrise above the fear,
p362
aVrise up, spread your wings,
p363
aVand soar, fly high, high, high, high, until you reach the stars,
p364
aVwhere all of us want to go.
p365
aa(lp366
VThank you.
