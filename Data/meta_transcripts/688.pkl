VOne day a one-eyed monkey came into the forest.
p4
aVUnder a tree she saw a woman
p5
aVmeditating furiously.
p6
aVThe one-eyed monkey recognized the woman, a Sekhri.
p7
aVShe was the wife of an even more famous Brahmin.
p8
aVTo watch her better, the one-eyed monkey climbed onto the tree.
p9
aVJust then, with a loud bang,
p10
aVthe heavens opened. (Claps)
p11
aVAnd the god Indra jumped into the clearing.
p12
aVIndra saw the woman, a Sekhri.
p13
aVAh-hah.
p14
aVThe woman paid him no heed.
p15
aVSo, Indra, attracted, threw her onto the floor,
p16
aVand proceeded to rape her.
p17
aVThen Indra disappeared. (Clap! Clap!)
p18
aVAnd the woman's husband, the Brahmin, appeared.
p19
aVHe realized at once what had happened.
p20
aVSo, he petitioned the higher gods
p21
aVso that he may have justice.
p22
aVSo, the god Vishnu arrived.
p23
aa(lp24
V"Are there any witnesses?"
p25
aa(lp26
V"Just a one-eyed monkey," said the Brahmin.
p27
aa(lp28
VNow, the one-eyed monkey
p29
aVreally wanted for the woman, a Sekhri, to get justice,
p30
aVso she retold events exactly as they had happened.
p31
aVVishnu gave his judgment.
p32
aa(lp33
V"The god Indra has sinned,
p34
aVin that he has sinned against ... a Brahmin.
p35
aVMay he be called to wash away his sins."
p36
aa(lp37
VSo, Indra arrived,
p38
aVand performed the sacrifice of the horse.
p39
aVAnd so it transpired
p40
aVthat a horse was killed,
p41
aVa god was made sin-free,
p42
aVa Brahmin's ego was appeased,
p43
aVa woman ... was ruined,
p44
aVand a one-eyed monkey was left ...
p45
aVvery confused at what we humans call justice.
p46
aa(lp47
VIn India there is a rape every three minutes.
p48
aVIn India, only 25 percent of rapes
p49
aVcome to a police station,
p50
aVand of these 25 percent that come to a police station,
p51
aVconvictions are only in four percent of the cases.
p52
aVThat's a lot of women who don't get justice.
p53
aa(lp54
VAnd it's not only about women.
p55
aVLook around you, look at your own countries.
p56
aVThere is a certain pattern in who gets charged with crimes.
p57
aVIf you're in Australia, it's mostly aboriginals who are in jail.
p58
aVIf you're in India, it's either Muslims or Adivasis,
p59
aVour tribals, the Naxalites.
p60
aVIf you're in the U.S., it's mostly the blacks.
p61
aVThere is a trend here.
p62
aVAnd the Brahmins and the gods, like in my story,
p63
aValways get to tell their truth as The Truth.
p64
aVSo, have we all become
p65
aVone-eyed \u2014 two-eyed instead of one-eyed \u2014 monkeys?
p66
aVHave we stopped seeing injustice?
p67
aa(lp68
VGood morning.
p69
aV(Applause)
p70
aVYou know, I have told this story
p71
aVclose to 550 times,
p72
aVin audiences in 40 countries,
p73
aVto school students, to black-tie dinners at the Smithsonian, and so on and so forth,
p74
aVand every time it hits something.
p75
aVNow, if I were to go into the same crowd
p76
aVand say, "I want to lecture you about justice and injustice,"
p77
aVthey would say, "Thank you very much, we have other things to do."
p78
aVAnd that is the astonishing power of art.
p79
aa(lp80
VArt can go through where other things can't.
p81
aVYou can't have barriers, because it breaks through your prejudices,
p82
aVbreaks through everything that you have as your mask,
p83
aVthat says, "I am this, I am that, I am that."
p84
aVNo. It breaks through those.
p85
aVAnd it reaches somewhere where other things don't.
p86
aVAnd in a world where attitudes are so difficult to change,
p87
aVwe need a language that reaches through.
p88
aa(lp89
VHitler knew it; he used Wagner
p90
aVto make all the Nazis feel wonderful and Aryan.
p91
aVAnd Mr. Berlusconi knows it, as he sits atop
p92
aVthis huge empire of media and television and so on and so forth.
p93
aVAnd all of the wonderful creative minds who are in all the advertising agencies,
p94
aVand who help corporate sell us things we absolutely don't require,
p95
aVthey also know the power of the arts.
p96
aa(lp97
VFor me it came very early.
p98
aVWhen I was a young child, my mother, who was a choreographer,
p99
aVcame upon a phenomenon that worried her.
p100
aVIt was a phenomenon where young brides
p101
aVwere committing suicide in rural Gujarat,
p102
aVbecause they were being forced to bring more and more money for their in-laws' families.
p103
aVAnd she created a dance piece which then Prime Minister Nehru saw.
p104
aVHe came to talk to her and said, "What is this about?"
p105
aVShe told him and he set out the first inquiry
p106
aVinto what today we call Dowry Dance.
p107
aVImagine a dance piece
p108
aVfor the first inquiry into something
p109
aVthat even today kills thousands of women.
p110
aa(lp111
VMany years later, when I was working with the director Peter Brook
p112
aVin "The Mahabharata" playing this feisty feminine feminist
p113
aVcalled Draupadi, I had similar experiences.
p114
aVBig fat black mamas in the Bronx
p115
aVused to come and say, "Hey girl, that's it!"
p116
aVAnd then these trendy young things in the Sorbonne would say,
p117
aV"Madame Draupadi, on n'est pas feministe, mais ça? Ça!"
p118
aVAnd then aboriginal women in Africa
p119
aVwould come and say, "This is it!"
p120
aVAnd I thought, "This is what we need,
p121
aVas a language."
p122
aa(lp123
VWe had somebody from public health. And Devdutt also mentioned public health.
p124
aVWell, millions of people around the world die
p125
aVof waterborne disease every year.
p126
aVAnd that's because there is no clean water to drink,
p127
aVor in countries like India,
p128
aVpeople don't know that they need to soap their hands before defecation.
p129
aVSo, what do they do?
p130
aVThey drink the water they know is dirty,
p131
aVthey get cholera, they get diarrhea, they get jaundice
p132
aVand they die.
p133
aVAnd governments have not been able to provide clean water.
p134
aVThey try and build it. They try and build pipelines; it doesn't happen.
p135
aVAnd the MNCs give them machines that they cannot afford.
p136
aVSo what do you do? Do you let them die?
p137
aa(lp138
VWell, somebody had a great idea.
p139
aVAnd it was a simple idea. It was an idea that could not profit anybody
p140
aVbut would help health in every field.
p141
aVMost houses in Asia and India
p142
aVhave a cotton garment.
p143
aVAnd it was discovered, and WHO endorses this,
p144
aVthat a clean cotton garment folded eight times over,
p145
aVcan reduce bacteria up to 80 percent from water sieved through.
p146
aVSo, why aren't governments blaring this on television?
p147
aVWhy isn't it on every poster across the third world?
p148
aVBecause there is no profit in it.
p149
aVBecause nobody can get a kickback.
p150
aVBut it still needs to get to people.
p151
aVAnd here is one of the ways we get it to people.
p152
aa(lp153
V[Video] Woman: Then get me one of those fancy water purifiers.
p154
aa(lp155
VMan: You know how expensive those are.
p156
aVI have a solution that requires neither machine,
p157
aVnor wood, nor cooking gas.
p158
aa(lp159
VWoman: What solution?
p160
aa(lp161
VMan: Listen, go fetch that cotton sari you have.
p162
aa(lp163
VBoy: Grand-dad, tell me the solution please.
p164
aa(lp165
VMan: I will tell all of you. Just wait.
p166
aa(lp167
VWoman: Here father. (Man: Is it clean?) Woman: Yes, of course.
p168
aa(lp169
VMan: Then do as I tell you. Fold the sari into eight folds.
p170
aa(lp171
VWoman: All right, father.
p172
aa(lp173
VMan: And you, you count that she does it right. (Boy: All right, grand-dad.)
p174
aa(lp175
VMan: One, two, three, four folds we make.
p176
aVAll the germs from the water we take.
p177
aa(lp178
VChorus: One, two, three, four folds we make.
p179
aVAll the germs from the water we take.
p180
aVFive, six, seven, eight folds we make.
p181
aVOur drinking water safe we make.
p182
aVFive, six, seven, eight folds we make.
p183
aVOur drinking water safe we make.
p184
aa(lp185
VWoman: Here, father, your eight-times folded cotton sari.
p186
aa(lp187
VMan: So this is the cotton sari.
p188
aVAnd through this we will have clean water.
p189
aa(lp190
V(Applause)
p191
aa(lp192
VI think it's safe to say that all of us here
p193
aVare deeply concerned about the escalating violence in our daily lives.
p194
aVWhile universities are trying to devise courses in conflict resolution,
p195
aVand governments are trying to stop skirmishes at borders,
p196
aVwe are surrounded by violence, whether it's road rage,
p197
aVor whether it's domestic violence,
p198
aVwhether it's a teacher beating up a student and killing her
p199
aVbecause she hasn't done her homework, it's everywhere.
p200
aVSo, why are we not doing something
p201
aVto actually attend that problem on a day to day basis?
p202
aa(lp203
VWhat are we doing to try and make children
p204
aVand young people realize
p205
aVthat violence is something that we indulge in,
p206
aVthat we can stop,
p207
aVand that there are other ways of actually
p208
aVtaking violence, taking anger, taking frustrations
p209
aVinto different things that do not harm other people.
p210
aVWell, here is one such way.
p211
aa(lp212
V(Video) (Laughs) You are peaceful people.
p213
aVYour parents were peaceful people.
p214
aVYour grandparents were peaceful people.
p215
aVSo much peace in one place?
p216
aVHow could it be otherwise?
p217
aa(lp218
V(Music)
p219
aa(lp220
VBut, what if ...
p221
aVYes. What if ...
p222
aVOne little gene in you
p223
aVhas been trying to get through?
p224
aVFrom your beginnings in Africa,
p225
aVthrough each generation, may be passed on to you,
p226
aVin your creation. It's a secret urge, hiding deep in you.
p227
aVAnd if it's in you, then it's in me too. Oh, dear.
p228
aa(lp229
VIt's what made you smack your baby brother,
p230
aVstamp on a cockroach, scratch your mother.
p231
aVIt's the feeling that wells up from deep inside,
p232
aVwhen your husband comes home drunk and you wanna tan his hide.
p233
aVWant to kill that cyclist on the way to work,
p234
aVand string up your cousin 'cause she's such a jerk. Oh, dear.
p235
aVAnd as for outsiders, white, black or brown,
p236
aVtar and feather them, and whip them out of town.
p237
aa(lp238
VIt's that little gene. It's small and it's mean.
p239
aVToo small for detection, it's your built-in protection.
p240
aVAdrenaline, kill. It'll give you the will.
p241
aVYes, you'd better face it 'cause you can't displace it.
p242
aVYou're V-I-O-L-E-N-T.
p243
aVCause you're either a victim, or on top, like me.
p244
aa(lp245
VGoodbye, Abraham Lincoln.
p246
aVGoodbye, Mahatma Gandhi.
p247
aVGoodbye, Martin Luther King.
p248
aVHello, gangs from this neighborhood
p249
aVkilling gangs from that neighborhood.
p250
aVHello governments of rich countries
p251
aVselling arms to governments of poor countries
p252
aVwho can't even afford to give them food.
p253
aVHello civilization. Hello, 21st century.
p254
aVLook what we've ...
p255
aVlook what they've done.
p256
aV(Applause)
p257
aa(lp258
VMainstream art, cinema,
p259
aVhas been used across the world to talk about social issues.
p260
aVA few years ago we had a film called Rang De Basanti,
p261
aVwhich suddenly spawned thousands of young people
p262
aVwanting to volunteer for social change.
p263
aVIn Venezuela, one of the most popular
p264
aVsoap operas has a heroine called Crystal.
p265
aVAnd when, onscreen, Crystal got breast cancer,
p266
aV75,000 more young women went to have mammographies done.
p267
aVAnd of course, "The Vagina Monologues" we know about.
p268
aVAnd there are stand-up comics
p269
aVwho are talking about racial issues, about ethnic issues.
p270
aa(lp271
VSo, why is it,
p272
aVthat if we think that we all agree
p273
aVthat we need a better world,
p274
aVwe need a more just world,
p275
aVwhy is it that we are not using the one language
p276
aVthat has consistently showed us
p277
aVthat we can break down barriers, that we can reach people?
p278
aVWhat I need to say to the planners of the world,
p279
aVthe governments, the strategists
p280
aVis, "You have treated the arts as the cherry on the cake.
p281
aVIt needs to be the yeast."
p282
aVBecause, any future planning,
p283
aVif 2048 is when we want to get there,
p284
aVunless the arts are put with the scientists,
p285
aVwith the economists,
p286
aVwith all those who prepare for the future, badly,
p287
aVwe're not going to get there.
p288
aVAnd unless this is actually internalized, it won't happen.
p289
aa(lp290
VSo, what is it that we require? What is it that we need?
p291
aVWe need to break down our vision
p292
aVof what planners are,
p293
aVof what the correct way of a path is.
p294
aVAnd to say all these years of trying
p295
aVto make a better world, and we have failed.
p296
aVThere are more people being raped. There are more wars.
p297
aVThere are more people dying of simple things.
p298
aVSo, something has got to give. And that is what I want.
p299
aVCan I have my last audio track please?
p300
aa(lp301
VOnce there was a princess who whistled beautifully.
p302
aV(Whistling)
p303
aVHer father the king said, "Don't whistle."
p304
aVHer mother the queen said, "Hai, don't whistle."
p305
aVBut the princess continued whistling.
p306
aV(Whistling)
p307
aa(lp308
VThe years went by and the princess grew up
p309
aVinto a beautiful young woman,
p310
aVwho whistled even more beautifully.
p311
aV(Whistling)
p312
aVHer father the king said, "Who will marry a whistling princess?"
p313
aVHer mother the queen said, "Who will marry a whistling princess?"
p314
aa(lp315
VBut the king had an idea.
p316
aVHe announced a Swayamvara.
p317
aVHe invited all the princes to come and defeat his daughter at whistling.
p318
aV"Whoever defeats my daughter shall have half my kingdom
p319
aVand her hand in marriage!"
p320
aVSoon the palace filled with princes whistling.
p321
aV(Whistling)
p322
aVSome whistled badly.
p323
aVSome whistled well.
p324
aVBut nobody could defeat the princess.
p325
aa(lp326
V"Now what shall we do?" said the king.
p327
aV"Now what shall we do?" said the queen.
p328
aVBut the princess said, "Father, Mother, don't worry.
p329
aVI have an idea. I am going to go to each of these young men
p330
aVand I am going to ask them
p331
aVif they defeated correctly.
p332
aVAnd if somebody answers, that shall be my wish."
p333
aa(lp334
VSo she went up to each and said, "Do you accept that I have defeated you?"
p335
aVAnd they said, "Me? Defeated by a woman?
p336
aVNo way, that's impossible! No no no no no! That's not possible."
p337
aVTill finally one prince said,
p338
aV"Princess, I accept, you have defeated me."
p339
aV"Uh-huh ..." she said.
p340
aV"Father, mother, this man shall be my wife."
p341
aV(Whistling)
p342
aa(lp343
VThank you.
