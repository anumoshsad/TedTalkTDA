VAlright.
p4
aVI'm going to show you a couple of images
p5
aVfrom a very diverting paper in The Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine.
p6
aVI'm going to go way out on a limb and say that it is the most diverting paper
p7
aVever published in The Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine.
p8
aVThe title is "Observations of In-Utero Masturbation."
p9
aa(lp10
V(Laughter)
p11
aa(lp12
VOkay. Now on the left you can see the hand \u2014 that's the big arrow \u2014
p13
aVand the penis on the right. The hand hovering.
p14
aVAnd over here we have,
p15
aVin the words of radiologist Israel Meisner,
p16
aV"The hand grasping the penis in a fashion resembling masturbation movements."
p17
aVBear in mind this was an ultrasound,
p18
aVso it would have been moving images.
p19
aa(lp20
VOrgasm is a reflex of the autonomic nervous system.
p21
aVNow, this is the part of the nervous system
p22
aVthat deals with the things that we don't consciously control,
p23
aVlike digestion, heart rate and sexual arousal.
p24
aVAnd the orgasm reflex can be triggered by a surprisingly broad range of input.
p25
aVGenital stimulation. Duh.
p26
aVBut also, Kinsey interviewed a woman
p27
aVwho could be brought to orgasm by having someone stroke her eyebrow.
p28
aVPeople with spinal cord injuries,
p29
aVlike paraplegias, quadriplegias,
p30
aVwill often develop a very, very sensitive area
p31
aVright above the level of their injury,
p32
aVwherever that is.
p33
aVThere is such a thing as a knee orgasm in the literature.
p34
aa(lp35
VI think the most curious one that I came across
p36
aVwas a case report of a woman
p37
aVwho had an orgasm every time she brushed her teeth.
p38
aa(lp39
V(Laughter)
p40
aa(lp41
VSomething in the complex sensory-motor action of brushing her teeth
p42
aVwas triggering orgasm.
p43
aVAnd she went to a neurologist, who was fascinated.
p44
aVHe checked to see if it was something in the toothpaste,
p45
aVbut no \u2014 it happened with any brand.
p46
aVThey stimulated her gums with a toothpick, to see if that was doing it.
p47
aVNo. It was the whole, you know, motion.
p48
aVAnd the amazing thing to me
p49
aVis that you would think this woman would have excellent oral hygiene.
p50
aa(lp51
V(Laughter)
p52
aa(lp53
VSadly \u2014 this is what it said in the journal paper \u2014
p54
aV"She believed that she was possessed by demons
p55
aVand switched to mouthwash for her oral care."
p56
aVIt's so sad.
p57
aa(lp58
V(Laughter)
p59
aa(lp60
VWhen I was working on the book,
p61
aVI interviewed a woman who can think herself to orgasm.
p62
aVShe was part of a study at Rutgers University.
p63
aVYou've got to love that. Rutgers.
p64
aVSo I interviewed her in Oakland, in a sushi restaurant.
p65
aVAnd I said, "So, could you do it right here?"
p66
aVAnd she said,
p67
aV"Yeah, but you know I'd rather finish my meal if you don't mind."
p68
aa(lp69
V(Laughter)
p70
aa(lp71
VBut afterwards, she was kind enough to demonstrate on a bench outside.
p72
aVIt was remarkable. It took about one minute.
p73
aVAnd I said to her,
p74
aV"Are you just doing this all the time?"
p75
aa(lp76
V(Laughter)
p77
aa(lp78
VShe said, "No. Honestly, when I get home, I'm usually too tired."
p79
aa(lp80
V(Laughter)
p81
aa(lp82
VShe said that the last time she had done it
p83
aVwas on the Disneyland tram.
p84
aa(lp85
V(Laughter)
p86
aa(lp87
VThe headquarters for orgasm, along the spinal nerve,
p88
aVis something called the sacral nerve root,
p89
aVwhich is back here.
p90
aVAnd if you trigger, if you stimulate with an electrode,
p91
aVthe precise spot, you will trigger an orgasm.
p92
aVAnd it is a fact that you can trigger spinal reflexes in dead people \u2014
p93
aVa certain kind of dead person, a beating-heart cadaver.
p94
aVNow this is somebody who is brain-dead,
p95
aVlegally dead, definitely checked out,
p96
aVbut is being kept alive on a respirator,
p97
aVso that their organs will be oxygenated for transplantation.
p98
aVNow in one of these brain-dead people,
p99
aVif you trigger the right spot,
p100
aVyou will see something every now and then.
p101
aVThere is a reflex called the Lazarus reflex.
p102
aVAnd this is \u2014 I'll demonstrate as best I can, not being dead.
p103
aVIt's like this. You trigger the spot.
p104
aVThe dead guy, or gal, goes... like that.
p105
aVVery unsettling for people working in pathology labs.
p106
aa(lp107
V(Laughter)
p108
aa(lp109
VNow, if you can trigger the Lazarus reflex in a dead person,
p110
aVwhy not the orgasm reflex?
p111
aVI asked this question to a brain death expert,
p112
aVStephanie Mann, who was foolish enough to return my emails.
p113
aa(lp114
V(Laughter)
p115
aa(lp116
VI said, "So, could you conceivably trigger an orgasm in a dead person?"
p117
aVShe said, "Yes, if the sacral nerve is being oxygenated,
p118
aVyou conceivably could."
p119
aVObviously it wouldn't be as much fun for the person.
p120
aVBut it would be an orgasm \u2014
p121
aa(lp122
V(Laughter)
p123
aa(lp124
Vnonetheless.
p125
aa(lp126
VThere is a researcher at the University of Alabama
p127
aVwho does orgasm research.
p128
aVI said to her, "You should do an experiment.
p129
aVYou know? You can get cadavers if you work at a university."
p130
aVI said, "You should actually do this."
p131
aVShe said, "You get the human subjects review board approval for this one."
p132
aa(lp133
V(Laughter)
p134
aa(lp135
VAccording to 1930s marriage manual author,
p136
aVTheodoor van De Velde,
p137
aVa slight seminal odor can be detected on the breath of a woman
p138
aVwithin about an hour after sexual intercourse.
p139
aVTheodoor van De Velde was something of a semen connoisseur.
p140
aa(lp141
V(Laughter)
p142
aa(lp143
VThis is a guy writing a book, "Ideal Marriage," you know.
p144
aVVery heavy hetero guy.
p145
aVBut he wrote in this book, "Ideal Marriage" \u2014
p146
aVhe said that he could differentiate between the semen of a young man,
p147
aVwhich he said had a fresh, exhilarating smell,
p148
aVand the semen of mature men, whose semen smelled, quote,
p149
aV"Remarkably like that of the flowers of the Spanish chestnut.
p150
aVSometimes quite freshly floral,
p151
aVand then again sometimes extremely pungent."
p152
aa(lp153
V(Laughter)
p154
aa(lp155
VOkay. In 1999, in the state of Israel, a man began hiccupping.
p156
aVAnd this was one of those cases that went on and on.
p157
aVHe tried everything his friends suggested.
p158
aVNothing seemed to help.
p159
aVDays went by.
p160
aVAt a certain point, the man, still hiccupping, had sex with his wife.
p161
aVAnd lo and behold, the hiccups went away.
p162
aVHe told his doctor, who published a case report
p163
aVin a Canadian medical journal under the title,
p164
aV"Sexual Intercourse as a Potential Treatment for Intractable Hiccups."
p165
aVI love this article because at a certain point they suggested
p166
aVthat unattached hiccuppers could try masturbation.
p167
aa(lp168
V(Laughter)
p169
aa(lp170
VI love that because there is like a whole demographic: unattached hiccuppers.
p171
aa(lp172
V(Laughter)
p173
aa(lp174
VMarried, single, unattached hiccupper.
p175
aVIn the 1900s, early 1900s,
p176
aVa lot of gynecologists believed that when a woman has an orgasm,
p177
aVthe contractions serve to suck the semen up through the cervix
p178
aVand sort of deliver it really quickly to the egg,
p179
aVthereby upping the odds of conception.
p180
aVIt was called the "upsuck" theory.
p181
aa(lp182
V(Laughter)
p183
aa(lp184
VIf you go all the way back to Hippocrates,
p185
aVphysicians believed that orgasm in women
p186
aVwas not just helpful for conception, but necessary.
p187
aVDoctors back then were routinely telling men
p188
aVthe importance of pleasuring their wives.
p189
aVMarriage-manual author and semen-sniffer Theodoor van De Velde \u2014
p190
aa(lp191
V(Laughter)
p192
aa(lp193
Vhas a line in his book.
p194
aVI loved this guy.
p195
aVI got a lot of mileage out of Theodoor van De Velde.
p196
aVHe had this line in his book
p197
aVthat supposedly comes from the Habsburg Monarchy,
p198
aVwhere there was an empress Maria Theresa,
p199
aVwho was having trouble conceiving.
p200
aVAnd apparently the royal court physician said to her,
p201
aV"I am of the opinion that the vulva of your most sacred majesty
p202
aVbe titillated for some time prior to intercourse."
p203
aa(lp204
V(Laughter)
p205
aa(lp206
VIt's apparently, I don't know, on the record somewhere.
p207
aa(lp208
VMasters and Johnson:
p209
aVnow we're moving forward to the 1950s.
p210
aVMasters and Johnson were upsuck skeptics,
p211
aVwhich is also really fun to say.
p212
aVThey didn't buy it.
p213
aVAnd they decided, being Masters and Johnson,
p214
aVthat they would get to the bottom of it.
p215
aVThey brought women into the lab \u2014 I think it was five women \u2014
p216
aVand outfitted them with cervical caps containing artificial semen.
p217
aVAnd in the artificial semen was a radio-opaque substance,
p218
aVsuch that it would show up on an X-ray.
p219
aVThis is the 1950s.
p220
aVAnyway, these women sat in front of an X-ray device.
p221
aVAnd they masturbated.
p222
aVAnd Masters and Johnson looked to see if the semen was being sucked up.
p223
aVDid not find any evidence of upsuck.
p224
aVYou may be wondering, "How do you make artificial semen?"
p225
aa(lp226
V(Laughter)
p227
aa(lp228
VI have an answer for you. I have two answers.
p229
aVYou can use flour and water, or cornstarch and water.
p230
aVI actually found three separate recipes in the literature.
p231
aa(lp232
V(Laughter)
p233
aa(lp234
VMy favorite being the one that says \u2014
p235
aVyou know, they have the ingredients listed,
p236
aVand then in a recipe it will say, for example,
p237
aV"Yield: two dozen cupcakes."
p238
aVThis one said, "Yield: one ejaculate."
p239
aa(lp240
V(Laughter)
p241
aa(lp242
VThere's another way that orgasm might boost fertility.
p243
aVThis one involves men.
p244
aVSperm that sit around in the body for a week or more
p245
aVstart to develop abnormalities
p246
aVthat make them less effective at head-banging their way into the egg.
p247
aVBritish sexologist Roy Levin has speculated
p248
aVthat this is perhaps why men
p249
aVevolved to be such enthusiastic and frequent masturbators.
p250
aVHe said, "If I keep tossing myself off I get fresh sperm being made."
p251
aVWhich I thought was an interesting idea, theory.
p252
aVSo now you have an evolutionary excuse.
p253
aa(lp254
V(Laughter)
p255
aa(lp256
VOkay.
p257
aa(lp258
V(Laughter)
p259
aa(lp260
VAll righty. There is considerable evidence for upsuck in the animal kingdom \u2014
p261
aVpigs, for instance.
p262
aVIn Denmark, the Danish National Committee for Pig Production
p263
aVfound out that if you sexually stimulate a sow
p264
aVwhile you artificially inseminate her,
p265
aVyou will see a six-percent increase in the farrowing rate,
p266
aVwhich is the number of piglets produced.
p267
aVSo they came up with this five-point stimulation plan for the sows.
p268
aVThere is posters they put in the barn, and they have a DVD.
p269
aVAnd I got a copy of this DVD.
p270
aa(lp271
V(Laughter)
p272
aa(lp273
VThis is my unveiling, because I am going to show you a clip.
p274
aa(lp275
V(Laughter)
p276
aa(lp277
VSo, okay.
p278
aVNow, here we go, la la la, off to work.
p279
aVIt all looks very innocent.
p280
aVHe's going to be doing things with his hands
p281
aVthat the boar would use his snout, lacking hands. Okay.
p282
aa(lp283
V(Laughter)
p284
aa(lp285
VThis is it.
p286
aVThe boar has a very odd courtship repertoire.
p287
aa(lp288
V(Laughter)
p289
aa(lp290
VThis is to mimic the weight of the boar.
p291
aa(lp292
V(Laughter)
p293
aa(lp294
VYou should know, the clitoris of the pig is inside the vagina.
p295
aVSo this may be sort of titillating for her.
p296
aVHere we go.
p297
aa(lp298
V(Laughter)
p299
aa(lp300
VAnd the happy result.
p301
aa(lp302
V(Applause)
p303
aa(lp304
VI love this video.
p305
aVThere is a point in this video, towards the beginning,
p306
aVwhere they zoom in for a close up of his hand with his wedding ring,
p307
aVas if to say, "It's okay, it's just his job.
p308
aVHe really does like women."
p309
aa(lp310
V(Laughter)
p311
aa(lp312
VOkay. When I was in Denmark, my host was named Anne Marie.
p313
aVAnd I said, "So why don't you just stimulate the clitoris of the pig?
p314
aVWhy don't you have the farmers do that?
p315
aVThat's not one of your five steps."
p316
aVI have to read you what she said, because I love it.
p317
aVShe said, "It was a big hurdle
p318
aVjust to get farmers to touch underneath the vulva.
p319
aVSo we thought, let's not mention the clitoris right now."
p320
aa(lp321
V(Laughter)
p322
aa(lp323
VShy but ambitious pig farmers, however, can purchase a \u2014 this is true \u2014
p324
aVa sow vibrator,
p325
aVthat hangs on the sperm feeder tube to vibrate.
p326
aVBecause, as I mentioned, the clitoris is inside the vagina.
p327
aVSo possibly, you know, a little more arousing than it looks.
p328
aVAnd I also said to her,
p329
aV"Now, these sows. I mean, you may have noticed there.
p330
aVThe sow doesn't look to be in the throes of ecstasy."
p331
aVAnd she said, you can't make that conclusion,
p332
aVbecause animals don't register pain or pleasure
p333
aVon their faces in the same way that we do.
p334
aVPigs, for example, are more like dogs.
p335
aVThey use the upper half of the face; the ears are very expressive.
p336
aVSo you're not really sure what's going on with the pig.
p337
aa(lp338
VPrimates, on the other hand, we use our mouths more.
p339
aVThis is the ejaculation face of the stump-tailed macaque.
p340
aa(lp341
V(Laughter)
p342
aa(lp343
VAnd, interestingly, this has been observed in female macaques,
p344
aVbut only when mounting another female.
p345
aa(lp346
V(Laughter)
p347
aa(lp348
VMasters and Johnson.
p349
aVIn the 1950s, they decided, okay, we're going to figure out
p350
aVthe entire human sexual response cycle,
p351
aVfrom arousal, all the way through orgasm, in men and women \u2014
p352
aVeverything that happens in the human body.
p353
aVOkay, with women, a lot of this is happening inside.
p354
aVThis did not stop Masters and Johnson.
p355
aVThey developed an artificial coition machine.
p356
aVThis is basically a penis camera on a motor.
p357
aVThere is a phallus,
p358
aVclear acrylic phallus, with a camera and a light source,
p359
aVattached to a motor that is kind of going like this.
p360
aVAnd the woman would have sex with it.
p361
aVThat is what they would do. Pretty amazing.
p362
aVSadly, this device has been dismantled.
p363
aVThis just kills me, not because I wanted to use it \u2014
p364
aVI wanted to see it.
p365
aa(lp366
V(Laughter)
p367
aa(lp368
VOne fine day,
p369
aVAlfred Kinsey decided to calculate
p370
aVthe average distance traveled by ejaculated semen.
p371
aVThis was not idle curiosity.
p372
aVDoctor Kinsey had heard \u2014
p373
aVand there was a theory going around at the time, this being the 1940s \u2014
p374
aVthat the force with which semen is thrown against the cervix
p375
aVwas a factor in fertility.
p376
aVKinsey thought it was bunk, so he got to work.
p377
aVHe got together in his lab
p378
aV300 men, a measuring tape, and a movie camera.
p379
aa(lp380
V(Laughter)
p381
aa(lp382
VAnd in fact, he found that in three quarters of the men
p383
aVthe stuff just kind of slopped out.
p384
aVIt wasn't spurted or thrown or ejected under great force.
p385
aVHowever, the record holder
p386
aVlanded just shy of the eight-foot mark, which is impressive.
p387
aa(lp388
V(Laughter)
p389
aa(lp390
V(Applause)
p391
aa(lp392
VYes. Exactly.
p393
aa(lp394
V(Laughter)
p395
aa(lp396
VSadly, he's anonymous. His name is not mentioned.
p397
aa(lp398
V(Laughter)
p399
aa(lp400
VIn his write-up of this experiment in his book,
p401
aVKinsey wrote,
p402
aV"Two sheets were laid down to protect the oriental carpets."
p403
aa(lp404
V(Laughter)
p405
aa(lp406
VWhich is my second favorite line in the entire oeuvre of Alfred Kinsey.
p407
aVMy favorite being, "Cheese crumbs spread before a pair of copulating rats
p408
aVwill distract the female, but not the male."
p409
aa(lp410
V(Laughter)
p411
aa(lp412
