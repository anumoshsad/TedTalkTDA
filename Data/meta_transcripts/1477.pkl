VWhen I was a child growing up in Maine,
p4
aVone of my favorite things to do
p5
aVwas to look for sand dollars on the seashores of Maine,
p6
aVbecause my parents told me it would bring me luck.
p7
aVBut you know, these shells, they're hard to find.
p8
aVThey're covered in sand, they're difficult to see.
p9
aVHowever, over time, I got used to looking for them.
p10
aVI started seeing shapes
p11
aVand patterns that helped me to collect them.
p12
aa(lp13
VThis grew into a passion for finding things,
p14
aVa love for the past and archaeology.
p15
aVAnd eventually, when I started studying Egyptology,
p16
aVI realized that seeing with my naked eyes alone wasn't enough.
p17
aVBecause all of the sudden, in Egypt,
p18
aVmy beach had grown from a tiny beach in Maine
p19
aVto one eight hundred miles long,
p20
aVnext to the Nile.
p21
aVAnd my sand dollars had grown to the size of cities.
p22
aVThis is really what brought me to using satellite imagery.
p23
aVFor trying to map the past, I knew that I had to see differently.
p24
aa(lp25
VSo I want to show you an example of how we see differently
p26
aVusing the infrared.
p27
aVThis is a site located in the eastern Egyptian delta
p28
aVcalled Mendes.
p29
aVAnd the site visibly appears brown,
p30
aVbut when we use the infrared
p31
aVand we process it, all of the sudden,
p32
aVusing false color,
p33
aVthe site appears as bright pink.
p34
aVWhat you are seeing
p35
aVare the actual chemical changes to the landscape
p36
aVcaused by the building materials and activities
p37
aVof the ancient Egyptians.
p38
aa(lp39
VWhat I want to share with you today
p40
aVis how we've used satellite data
p41
aVto find an ancient Egyptian city,
p42
aVcalled Itjtawy,
p43
aVmissing for thousands of years.
p44
aVItjtawy was ancient Egypt's capital
p45
aVfor over four hundred years,
p46
aVat a period of time called the Middle Kingdom,
p47
aVabout four thousand years ago.
p48
aVThe site is located in the Faiyum of Egypt,
p49
aVand the site is really important,
p50
aVbecause in the Middle Kingdom there was this great renaissance
p51
aVfor ancient Egyptian art, architecture and religion.
p52
aVEgyptologists have always known the site of Itjtawy
p53
aVwas located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings who built it,
p54
aVindicated within the red circles here,
p55
aVbut somewhere within this massive flood plain.
p56
aVThis area is huge \u2014
p57
aVit's four miles by three miles in size.
p58
aVThe Nile used to flow right next to the city of Itjtawy,
p59
aVand as it shifted and changed and moved over time to the east,
p60
aVit covered over the city.
p61
aa(lp62
VSo, how do you find a buried city
p63
aVin a vast landscape?
p64
aVFinding it randomly would be the equivalent
p65
aVof locating a needle in a haystack,
p66
aVblindfolded, wearing baseball mitts.
p67
aa(lp68
V(Laughter)
p69
aa(lp70
VSo what we did is we used NASA topography data
p71
aVto map out the landscape, very subtle changes.
p72
aVWe started to be able to see where the Nile used to flow.
p73
aVBut you can see in more detail, and even more interesting,
p74
aVthis very slight raised area
p75
aVseen within the circle up here
p76
aVwhich we thought could possibly be the location of the city of Itjtawy.
p77
aa(lp78
VSo we collaborated with Egyptian scientists
p79
aVto do coring work, which you see here.
p80
aVWhen I say coring, it's like ice coring,
p81
aVbut instead of layers of climate change,
p82
aVyou're looking for layers of human occupation.
p83
aVAnd, five meters down,
p84
aVunderneath a thick layer of mud,
p85
aVwe found a dense layer of pottery.
p86
aVWhat this shows is that at this possible location of Itjtawy,
p87
aVfive meters down,
p88
aVwe have a layer of occupation for several hundred years,
p89
aVdating to the Middle Kingdom,
p90
aVdating to the exact period of time we think Itjtawy is.
p91
aVWe also found work stone \u2014
p92
aVcarnelian, quartz and agate
p93
aVthat shows that there was a jeweler's workshop here.
p94
aVThese might not look like much,
p95
aVbut when you think about the most common stones
p96
aVused in jewelry from the Middle Kingdom,
p97
aVthese are the stones that were used.
p98
aa(lp99
VSo, we have a dense layer of occupation
p100
aVdating to the Middle Kingdom at this site.
p101
aVWe also have evidence of an elite jeweler's workshop,
p102
aVshowing that whatever was there was a very important city.
p103
aVNo Itjtawy was here yet,
p104
aVbut we're going to be returning to the site
p105
aVin the near future to map it out.
p106
aVAnd even more importantly,
p107
aVwe have funding to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology
p108
aVso they can be the ones making great discoveries as well.
p109
aa(lp110
VSo I wanted to end with my favorite quote from the Middle Kingdom \u2014
p111
aVit was probably written at the city of Itjtawy
p112
aVfour thousand years ago.
p113
aV"Sharing knowledge is the greatest of all callings.
p114
aVThere's nothing like it in the land."
p115
aVSo as it turns out, TED was not founded in 1984 AD.
p116
aa(lp117
V(Laughter)
p118
aa(lp119
VMaking ideas actually started in 1984 BC
p120
aVat a not-lost-for-long city, found from above.
p121
aVIt certainly puts finding seashells by the seashore in perspective.
p122
aa(lp123
VThank you very much.
p124
aa(lp125
V(Applause)
p126
aa(lp127
VThank you.
