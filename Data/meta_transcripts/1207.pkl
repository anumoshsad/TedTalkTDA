VClimate change is already a heavy topic,
p4
aVand it's getting heavier
p5
aVbecause we're understanding
p6
aVthat we need to do more than we are.
p7
aVWe're understanding, in fact,
p8
aVthat those of us who live in the developed world
p9
aVneed to be really pushing towards eliminating our emissions.
p10
aVThat's, to put it mildly, not what's on the table now.
p11
aVAnd it tends to feel a little overwhelming
p12
aVwhen we look at what is there in reality today
p13
aVand the magnitude of the problem that we face.
p14
aVAnd when we have overwhelming problems in front of us,
p15
aVwe tend to seek simple answers.
p16
aVAnd I think this is what we've done with climate change.
p17
aVWe look at where the emissions are coming from \u2014
p18
aVthey're coming out of our tailpipes and smokestacks and so forth,
p19
aVand we say, okay, well the problem is
p20
aVthat they're coming out of fossil fuels that we're burning,
p21
aVso therefore, the answer must be
p22
aVto replace those fossil fuels with clean sources of energy.
p23
aVAnd while, of course, we do need clean energy,
p24
aVI would put to you that it's possible
p25
aVthat by looking at climate change
p26
aVas a clean energy generation problem,
p27
aVwe're in fact setting ourselves up
p28
aVnot to solve it.
p29
aa(lp30
VAnd the reason why
p31
aVis that we live on a planet
p32
aVthat is rapidly urbanizing.
p33
aVThat shouldn't be news to any of us.
p34
aVHowever, it's hard sometimes
p35
aVto remember the extent of that urbanization.
p36
aVBy mid-century,
p37
aVwe're going to have about eight billion \u2014 perhaps more \u2014 people
p38
aVliving in cities or within a day's travel of one.
p39
aVWe will be an overwhelmingly urban species.
p40
aVIn order to provide
p41
aVthe kind of energy that it would take
p42
aVfor eight billion people living in cities
p43
aVthat are even somewhat like the cities
p44
aVthat those of us in the global North live in today,
p45
aVwe would have to generate
p46
aVan absolutely astonishing amount of energy.
p47
aVIt may be possible
p48
aVthat we are not even able
p49
aVto build that much clean energy.
p50
aVSo if we're seriously talking about tackling climate change
p51
aVon an urbanizing planet,
p52
aVwe need to look somewhere else for the solution.
p53
aa(lp54
VThe solution, in fact, may be closer to hand than we think,
p55
aVbecause all of those cities we're building
p56
aVare opportunities.
p57
aVEvery city determines to a very large extent
p58
aVthe amount of energy used by its inhabitants.
p59
aVWe tend to think of energy use as a behavioral thing \u2014
p60
aVI choose to turn this light switch on \u2014
p61
aVbut really, enormous amounts of our energy use
p62
aVare predestined
p63
aVby the kinds of communities and cities that we live in.
p64
aVI won't show you very many graphs today,
p65
aVbut if I can just focus on this one for a moment,
p66
aVit really tells us a lot of what we need to know \u2014
p67
aVwhich is, quite simply,
p68
aVthat if you look, for example, at transportation,
p69
aVa major category of climate emissions,
p70
aVthere is a direct relationship
p71
aVbetween how dense a city is
p72
aVand the amount of climate emissions
p73
aVthat its residents spew out into the air.
p74
aVAnd the correlation, of course,
p75
aVis that denser places tend to have lower emissions \u2014
p76
aVwhich isn't really all that difficult to figure out, if you think about it.
p77
aa(lp78
VBasically,
p79
aVwe substitute, in our lives,
p80
aVaccess to the things we want.
p81
aVWe go out there and we hop in our cars
p82
aVand we drive from place to place.
p83
aVAnd we're basically using mobility to get the access we need.
p84
aVBut when we live in a denser community,
p85
aVsuddenly what we find, of course,
p86
aVis that the things we need are close by.
p87
aVAnd since the most sustainable trip
p88
aVis the one that you never had to make in the first place,
p89
aVsuddenly our lives become instantly more sustainable.
p90
aVAnd it is possible, of course,
p91
aVto increase the density of the communities around us.
p92
aa(lp93
VSome places are doing this with new eco districts,
p94
aVdeveloping whole new sustainable neighborhoods,
p95
aVwhich is nice work if you can get it,
p96
aVbut most of the time, what we're talking about is, in fact,
p97
aVreweaving the urban fabric that we already have.
p98
aVSo we're talking about things like infill development:
p99
aVreally sharp little changes
p100
aVto where we have buildings, where we're developing.
p101
aVUrban retrofitting:
p102
aVcreating different sorts of spaces and uses
p103
aVout of places that are already there.
p104
aVIncreasingly, we're realizing
p105
aVthat we don't even need to densify an entire city.
p106
aVWhat we need instead is an average density
p107
aVthat rises to a level
p108
aVwhere we don't drive as much and so on.
p109
aVAnd that can be done
p110
aVby raising the density in very specific spots a whole lot.
p111
aVSo you can think of it as tent poles
p112
aVthat actually raise the density of the entire city.
p113
aa(lp114
VAnd we find that when we do that,
p115
aVwe can, in fact, have a few places that are really hyper-dense
p116
aVwithin a wider fabric of places
p117
aVthat are perhaps a little more comfortable
p118
aVand achieve the same results.
p119
aVNow we may find that there are places that are really, really dense
p120
aVand still hold onto their cars,
p121
aVbut the reality is that, by and large,
p122
aVwhat we see when we get a lot of people together with the right conditions
p123
aVis a threshold effect,
p124
aVwhere people simply stop driving as much,
p125
aVand increasingly, more and more people,
p126
aVif they're surrounded by places that make them feel at home,
p127
aVgive up their cars altogether.
p128
aVAnd this is a huge, huge energy savings,
p129
aVbecause what comes out of our tailpipe
p130
aVis really just the beginning of the story
p131
aVwith climate emissions from cars.
p132
aVWe have the manufacture of the car, the disposal of the car,
p133
aVall of the parking and freeways and so on.
p134
aVWhen you can get rid of all of those
p135
aVbecause somebody doesn't use any of them really,
p136
aVyou find that you can actually cut transportation emissions
p137
aVas much as 90 percent.
p138
aa(lp139
VAnd people are embracing this.
p140
aVAll around the world, we're seeing more and more people embrace this walkshed life.
p141
aVPeople are saying that it's moving from the idea of the dream home
p142
aVto the dream neighborhood.
p143
aVAnd when you layer that over
p144
aVwith the kind of ubiquitous communications that we're starting to see,
p145
aVwhat you find is, in fact,
p146
aVeven more access suffused into spaces.
p147
aVSome of it's transportation access.
p148
aVThis is a Mapnificent map that shows me, in this case,
p149
aVhow far I can get from my home in 30 minutes
p150
aVusing public transportation.
p151
aVSome of it is about walking. It's not all perfect yet.
p152
aVThis is Google Walking Maps.
p153
aVI asked how to do the greater Ridgeway,
p154
aVand it told me to go via Guernsey.
p155
aVIt did tell me that this route
p156
aVmaybe missing sidewalks or pedestrian paths, though.
p157
aV(Laughter)
p158
aVBut the technologies are getting better,
p159
aVand we're starting to really kind of crowdsource this navigation.
p160
aVAnd as we just heard earlier,
p161
aVof course, we're also learning how to put information on dumb objects.
p162
aVThings that don't have any wiring in them at all,
p163
aVwe're learning how to include
p164
aVin these systems of notation and navigation.
p165
aa(lp166
VPart of what we're finding with this
p167
aVis that what we thought
p168
aVwas the major point
p169
aVof manufacturing and consumption,
p170
aVwhich is to get a bunch of stuff,
p171
aVis not, in fact,
p172
aVhow we really live best in dense environments.
p173
aVWhat we're finding is that what we want
p174
aVis access to the capacities of things.
p175
aVMy favorite example is a drill. Who here owns a drill, a home power drill?
p176
aVOkay. I do too.
p177
aVThe average home power drill is used somewhere between six and 20 minutes
p178
aVin its entire lifetime,
p179
aVdepending on who you ask.
p180
aVAnd so what we do is we buy these drills
p181
aVthat have a potential capacity of thousands of hours of drill time,
p182
aVuse them once or twice to put a hole in the wall and let them sit.
p183
aVOur cities, I would put to you,
p184
aVare stockpiles of these surplus capacities.
p185
aVAnd while we could try and figure out
p186
aVnew ways to use those capacities \u2014
p187
aVsuch as cooking or making ice sculptures
p188
aVor even a mafia hit \u2014
p189
aVwhat we probably will find
p190
aVis that, in fact, turning those products into services
p191
aVthat we have access to when we want them,
p192
aVis a far smarter way to go.
p193
aa(lp194
VAnd in fact, even space itself is turning into a service.
p195
aVWe're finding that people can share the same spaces,
p196
aVdo stuff with vacant space.
p197
aVBuildings are becoming bundles of services.
p198
aVSo we have new designs
p199
aVthat are helping us take mechanical things that we used to spend energy on \u2014
p200
aVlike heating, cooling etc. \u2014
p201
aVand turn them into things that we avoid spending energy on.
p202
aVSo we light our buildings with daylight.
p203
aVWe cool them with breezes. We heat them with sunshine.
p204
aVIn fact, when we use all these things,
p205
aVwhat we've found is that, in some cases,
p206
aVenergy use in a building can drop as much as 90 percent.
p207
aVWhich brings on another threshold effect
p208
aVI like to call furnace dumping,
p209
aVwhich is, quite simply,
p210
aVif you have a building that doesn't need to be heated with a furnace,
p211
aVyou save a whole bunch of money up front.
p212
aVThese things actually become cheaper to build
p213
aVthan the alternatives.
p214
aa(lp215
VNow when we look at being able
p216
aVto slash our product use, slash our transportation use,
p217
aVslash our building energy use,
p218
aVall of that is great, but it still leaves something behind.
p219
aVAnd if we're going to really, truly become sustainable cities,
p220
aVwe need to think a little differently.
p221
aVThis is one way to do it.
p222
aVThis is Vancouver's propaganda about how green a city they are.
p223
aVAnd certainly lots of people have taken to heart
p224
aVthis idea that a sustainable city is covered in greenery.
p225
aVSo we have visions like this.
p226
aVWe have visions like this. We have visions like this.
p227
aa(lp228
VNow all of these are fine projects,
p229
aVbut they really have missed an essential point,
p230
aVwhich is it's not about the leaves above,
p231
aVit's about the systems below.
p232
aVDo they, for instance, capture rainwater
p233
aVso that we can reduce water use?
p234
aVWater is energy intensive.
p235
aVDo they, perhaps, include green infrastructure,
p236
aVso that we can take runoff
p237
aVand water that's going out of our houses
p238
aVand clean it and filter it
p239
aVand grow urban street trees?
p240
aVDo they connect us back to the ecosystems around us
p241
aVby, for example, connecting us to rivers
p242
aVand allowing for restoration?
p243
aVDo they allow for pollination,
p244
aVpollinator pathways
p245
aVthat bees and butterflies and such can come back into our cities?
p246
aVDo they even take the very waste matter
p247
aVthat we have from food and fiber and so forth,
p248
aVand turn it back into soil
p249
aVand sequester carbon \u2014
p250
aVtake carbon out of the air
p251
aVin the process of using our cities?
p252
aa(lp253
VI would submit to you that all of these things are not only possible,
p254
aVthey're being done right now,
p255
aVand that it's a darn good thing.
p256
aVBecause right now, our economy by and large
p257
aVoperates as Paul Hawken said,
p258
aV"by stealing the future, selling it in the present
p259
aVand calling it GDP."
p260
aVAnd if we have another eight billion
p261
aVor seven billion,
p262
aVor six billion, even, people,
p263
aVliving on a planet where their cities also steal the future,
p264
aVwe're going to run out of future really fast.
p265
aVBut if we think differently,
p266
aVI think that, in fact, we can have cities
p267
aVthat are not only zero emissions,
p268
aVbut have unlimited possibilities as well.
