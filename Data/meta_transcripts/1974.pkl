VWhen I was born,
p4
aVthere was really only one book
p5
aVabout how to raise your children,
p6
aVand it was written by Dr. Spock.
p7
aV(Laughter)
p8
aVThank you for indulging me.
p9
aVI have always wanted to do that.
p10
aa(lp11
VNo, it was Benjamin Spock,
p12
aVand his book was called "The Common Sense Book of Baby And Child Care."
p13
aVIt sold almost 50 million copies  by the time he died.
p14
aVToday, I, as the mother of a six-year-old,
p15
aVwalk into Barnes and Noble,
p16
aVand see this.
p17
aVAnd it is amazing
p18
aVthe variety that one finds  on those shelves.
p19
aVThere are guides to raising  an eco-friendly kid,
p20
aVa gluten-free kid,
p21
aVa disease-proof kid,
p22
aVwhich, if you ask me, is a little bit creepy.
p23
aVThere are guides to raising a bilingual kid
p24
aVeven if you only speak one language at home.
p25
aVThere are guides to raising a financially savvy kid
p26
aVand a science-minded kid
p27
aVand a kid who is a whiz at yoga.
p28
aVShort of teaching your toddler how to defuse
p29
aVa nuclear bomb,
p30
aVthere is pretty much a guide to everything.
p31
aa(lp32
VAll of these books are well-intentioned.
p33
aVI am sure that many of them are great.
p34
aVBut taken together, I am sorry,
p35
aVI do not see help
p36
aVwhen I look at that shelf.
p37
aVI see anxiety.
p38
aVI see a giant candy-colored monument
p39
aVto our collective panic,
p40
aVand it makes me want to know,
p41
aVwhy is it that raising our children
p42
aVis associated with so much anguish
p43
aVand so much confusion?
p44
aVWhy is it that we are at sixes and sevens
p45
aVabout the one thing human beings
p46
aVhave been doing successfully for millennia,
p47
aVlong before parenting message boards
p48
aVand peer-reviewed studies came along?
p49
aVWhy is it that so many mothers and fathers
p50
aVexperience parenthood as a kind of crisis?
p51
aa(lp52
VCrisis might seem like a strong word,
p53
aVbut there is data suggesting it probably isn't.
p54
aVThere was, in fact, a paper of just this very name,
p55
aV"Parenthood as Crisis," published in 1957,
p56
aVand in the 50-plus years since,
p57
aVthere has been plenty of scholarship
p58
aVdocumenting a pretty clear pattern
p59
aVof parental anguish.
p60
aVParents experience more stress than non-parents.
p61
aVTheir marital satisfaction is lower.
p62
aVThere have been a number of studies
p63
aVlooking at how parents feel
p64
aVwhen they are spending time with their kids,
p65
aVand the answer often is, not so great.
p66
aVLast year, I spoke with a researcher
p67
aVnamed Matthew Killingsworth
p68
aVwho is doing a very, very imaginative project
p69
aVthat tracks people's happiness,
p70
aVand here is what he told me he found:
p71
aV"Interacting with your friends
p72
aVis better than interacting with your spouse,
p73
aVwhich is better than interacting with other relatives,
p74
aVwhich is better than interacting with acquaintances,
p75
aVwhich is better than interacting with parents,
p76
aVwhich is better than interacting with children.
p77
aVWho are on par with strangers."
p78
aV(Laughter)
p79
aa(lp80
VBut here's the thing.
p81
aVI have been looking at what underlies these data
p82
aVfor three years,
p83
aVand children are not the problem.
p84
aVSomething about parenting right now at this moment
p85
aVis the problem.
p86
aVSpecifically, I don't think we know
p87
aVwhat parenting is supposed to be.
p88
aVParent, as a verb,
p89
aVonly entered common usage in 1970.
p90
aVOur roles as mothers and fathers have changed.
p91
aVThe roles of our children have changed.
p92
aVWe are all now furiously improvising
p93
aVour way through a situation
p94
aVfor which there is no script,
p95
aVand if you're an amazing jazz musician,
p96
aVthen improv is great,
p97
aVbut for the rest of us,
p98
aVit can kind of feel like a crisis.
p99
aa(lp100
VSo how did we get here?
p101
aVHow is it that we are all now navigating
p102
aVa child-rearing universe
p103
aVwithout any norms to guide us?
p104
aVWell, for starters, there has been
p105
aVa major historical change.
p106
aVUntil fairly recently,
p107
aVkids worked, on our farms primarily,
p108
aVbut also in factories, mills, mines.
p109
aVKids were considered economic assets.
p110
aVSometime during the Progressive Era,
p111
aVwe put an end to this arrangement.
p112
aVWe recognized kids had rights,
p113
aVwe banned child labor,
p114
aVwe focused on education instead,
p115
aVand school became a child's new work.
p116
aVAnd thank God it did.
p117
aVBut that only made a parent's role
p118
aVmore confusing in a way.
p119
aVThe old arrangement might not have been
p120
aVparticularly ethical, but it was reciprocal.
p121
aVWe provided food, clothing, shelter,
p122
aVand moral instruction to our kids,
p123
aVand they in return provided income.
p124
aa(lp125
VOnce kids stopped working,
p126
aVthe economics of parenting changed.
p127
aVKids became, in the words of one
p128
aVbrilliant if totally ruthless sociologist,
p129
aV"economically worthless but emotionally priceless."
p130
aVRather than them working for us,
p131
aVwe began to work for them,
p132
aVbecause within only a matter of decades
p133
aVit became clear:
p134
aVif we wanted our kids to succeed,
p135
aVschool was not enough.
p136
aVToday, extracurricular activities are a kid's new work,
p137
aVbut that's work for us too,
p138
aVbecause we are the ones driving them to soccer practice.
p139
aVMassive piles of homework are a kid's new work,
p140
aVbut that's also work for us,
p141
aVbecause we have to check it.
p142
aVAbout three years ago, a Texas woman
p143
aVtold something to me
p144
aVthat totally broke my heart.
p145
aVShe said, almost casually,
p146
aV"Homework is the new dinner."
p147
aVThe middle class now pours all of its time
p148
aVand energy and resources into its kids,
p149
aVeven though the middle class
p150
aVhas less and less of those things to give.
p151
aVMothers now spend more time with their children
p152
aVthan they did in 1965,
p153
aVwhen most women were not even in the workforce.
p154
aa(lp155
VIt would probably be easier for parents
p156
aVto do their new roles
p157
aVif they knew what they were preparing their kids for.
p158
aVThis is yet another thing that makes modern parenting
p159
aVso very confounding.
p160
aVWe have no clue what portion our wisdom, if any,
p161
aVis of use to our kids.
p162
aVThe world is changing so rapidly,
p163
aVit's impossible to say.
p164
aVThis was true even when I was young.
p165
aVWhen I was a kid, high school specifically,
p166
aVI was told that I would be at sea
p167
aVin the new global economy
p168
aVif I did not know Japanese.
p169
aVAnd with all due respect to the Japanese,
p170
aVit didn't turn out that way.
p171
aVNow there is a certain kind of middle-class parent
p172
aVthat is obsessed with teaching their kids Mandarin,
p173
aVand maybe they're onto something,
p174
aVbut we cannot know for sure.
p175
aVSo, absent being able to anticipate the future,
p176
aVwhat we all do, as good parents,
p177
aVis try and prepare our kids
p178
aVfor every possible kind of future,
p179
aVhoping that just one of our efforts will pay off.
p180
aVWe teach our kids chess,
p181
aVthinking maybe they will need analytical skills.
p182
aVWe sign them up for team sports,
p183
aVthinking maybe they will need collaborative skills,
p184
aVyou know, for when they go to Harvard Business School.
p185
aVWe try and teach them to be financially savvy
p186
aVand science-minded and eco-friendly
p187
aVand gluten-free,
p188
aVthough now is probably a good time to tell you
p189
aVthat I was not eco-friendly and gluten-free as a child.
p190
aVI ate jars of pureed macaroni and beef.
p191
aVAnd you know what? I'm doing okay.
p192
aVI pay my taxes.
p193
aVI hold down a steady job.
p194
aVI was even invited to speak at TED.
p195
aVBut the presumption now is that
p196
aVwhat was good enough for me, or for my folks for that matter,
p197
aVisn't good enough anymore.
p198
aVSo we all make a mad dash to that bookshelf,
p199
aVbecause we feel like if we aren't trying everything,
p200
aVit's as if we're doing nothing
p201
aVand we're defaulting on our obligations to our kids.
p202
aa(lp203
VSo it's hard enough to navigate our new roles
p204
aVas mothers and fathers.
p205
aVNow add to this problem something else:
p206
aVwe are also navigating new roles
p207
aVas husbands and wives
p208
aVbecause most women today are in the workforce.
p209
aVThis is another reason, I think,
p210
aVthat parenthood feels like a crisis.
p211
aVWe have no rules, no scripts, no norms
p212
aVfor what to do when a child comes along
p213
aVnow that both mom and dad are breadwinners.
p214
aVThe writer Michael Lewis once put this
p215
aVvery, very well.
p216
aVHe said that the surest way
p217
aVfor a couple to start fighting
p218
aVis for them to go out to dinner with another couple
p219
aVwhose division of labor
p220
aVis ever so slightly different from theirs,
p221
aVbecause the conversation in the car on the way home
p222
aVgoes something like this:
p223
aV"So, did you catch that Dave is the one
p224
aVwho walks them to school every morning?"
p225
aV(Laughter)
p226
aVWithout scripts telling us who does what
p227
aVin this brave new world, couples fight,
p228
aVand both mothers and fathers each have
p229
aVtheir legitimate gripes.
p230
aVMothers are much more likely
p231
aVto be multi-tasking when they are at home,
p232
aVand fathers, when they are at home,
p233
aVare much more likely to be mono-tasking.
p234
aVFind a guy at home, and odds are
p235
aVhe is doing just one thing at a time.
p236
aVIn fact, UCLA recently did a study
p237
aVlooking at the most common configuration
p238
aVof family members in middle-class homes.
p239
aVGuess what it was?
p240
aVDad in a room by himself.
p241
aVAccording to the American Time Use Survey,
p242
aVmothers still do twice as much childcare as fathers,
p243
aVwhich is better than it was in Erma Bombeck's day,
p244
aVbut I still think that something she wrote
p245
aVis highly relevant:
p246
aV"I have not been alone in the bathroom since October."
p247
aV(Laughter)
p248
aa(lp249
VBut here is the thing: Men are doing plenty.
p250
aVThey spend more time with their kids
p251
aVthan their fathers ever spent with them.
p252
aVThey work more paid hours, on average,
p253
aVthan their wives,
p254
aVand they genuinely want to be good,
p255
aVinvolved dads.
p256
aVToday, it is fathers, not mothers,
p257
aVwho report the most work-life conflict.
p258
aa(lp259
VEither way, by the way,
p260
aVif you think it's hard for traditional families
p261
aVto sort out these new roles,
p262
aVjust imagine what it's like now
p263
aVfor non-traditional families:
p264
aVfamilies with two dads, families with two moms,
p265
aVsingle-parent households.
p266
aVThey are truly improvising as they go.
p267
aa(lp268
VNow, in a more progressive country,
p269
aVand forgive me here for capitulating to cliché
p270
aVand invoking, yes, Sweden,
p271
aVparents could rely on the state
p272
aVfor support.
p273
aVThere are countries that acknowledge
p274
aVthe anxieties and the changing roles
p275
aVof mothers and fathers.
p276
aVUnfortunately, the United States is not one of them,
p277
aVso in case you were wondering what the U.S.
p278
aVhas in common with Papua New Guinea and Liberia,
p279
aVit's this:
p280
aVWe too have no paid maternity leave policy.
p281
aVWe are one of eight known countries that does not.
p282
aa(lp283
VIn this age of intense confusion,
p284
aVthere is just one goal upon which
p285
aVall parents can agree,
p286
aVand that is whether they are
p287
aVtiger moms or hippie moms, helicopters or drones,
p288
aVour kids' happiness is paramount.
p289
aVThat is what it means
p290
aVto raise kids in an age
p291
aVwhen they are economically worthless
p292
aVbut emotionally priceless.
p293
aVWe are all the custodians of their self-esteem.
p294
aVThe one mantra no parent ever questions is,
p295
aV"All I want is for my children to be happy."
p296
aVAnd don't get me wrong:
p297
aVI think happiness is a wonderful goal for a child.
p298
aVBut it is a very elusive one.
p299
aVHappiness and self-confidence,
p300
aVteaching children that is not like teaching them
p301
aVhow to plow a field.
p302
aVIt's not like teaching them how to ride a bike.
p303
aVThere's no curriculum for it.
p304
aVHappiness and self-confidence can be the byproducts of other things,
p305
aVbut they cannot really be goals unto themselves.
p306
aVA child's happiness
p307
aVis a very unfair burden to place on a parent.
p308
aVAnd happiness is an even more unfair burden
p309
aVto place on a kid.
p310
aa(lp311
VAnd I have to tell you,
p312
aVI think it leads to some very strange excesses.
p313
aVWe are now so anxious
p314
aVto protect our kids from the world's ugliness
p315
aVthat we now shield them from "Sesame Street."
p316
aVI wish I could say I was kidding about this,
p317
aVbut if you go out and you buy
p318
aVthe first few episodes of "Sesame Street" on DVD,
p319
aVas I did out of nostalgia,
p320
aVyou will find a warning at the beginning
p321
aVsaying that the content is not suitable
p322
aVfor children.
p323
aV(Laughter)
p324
aVCan I just repeat that?
p325
aVThe content of the original "Sesame Street"
p326
aVis not suitable for children.
p327
aVWhen asked about this by The New York Times,
p328
aVa producer for the show gave a variety of explanations.
p329
aVOne was that Cookie Monster smoked a pipe
p330
aVin one skit and then swallowed it.
p331
aVBad modeling. I don't know.
p332
aVBut the thing that stuck with me
p333
aVis she said that she didn't know
p334
aVwhether Oscar the Grouch could be invented today
p335
aVbecause he was too depressive.
p336
aVI cannot tell you how much this distresses me.
p337
aV(Laughter)
p338
aVYou are looking at a woman
p339
aVwho has a periodic table of the Muppets
p340
aVhanging from her cubicle wall.
p341
aVThe offending muppet, right there.
p342
aa(lp343
VThat's my son the day he was born.
p344
aVI was high as a kite on morphine.
p345
aVI had had an unexpected C-section.
p346
aVBut even in my opiate haze,
p347
aVI managed to have one very clear thought
p348
aVthe first time I held him.
p349
aVI whispered it into his ear.
p350
aVI said, "I will try so hard not to hurt you."
p351
aVIt was the Hippocratic Oath,
p352
aVand I didn't even know I was saying it.
p353
aVBut it occurs to me now
p354
aVthat the Hippocratic Oath
p355
aVis a much more realistic aim than happiness.
p356
aVIn fact, as any parent will tell you,
p357
aVit's awfully hard.
p358
aVAll of us have said or done hurtful things
p359
aVthat we wish to God we could take back.
p360
aVI think in another era
p361
aVwe did not expect quite so much from ourselves,
p362
aVand it is important that we all remember that
p363
aVthe next time we are staring with our hearts racing
p364
aVat those bookshelves.
p365
aVI'm not really sure how to create new norms
p366
aVfor this world,
p367
aVbut I do think that
p368
aVin our desperate quest to create happy kids,
p369
aVwe may be assuming the wrong moral burden.
p370
aVIt strikes me as a better goal,
p371
aVand, dare I say, a more virtuous one,
p372
aVto focus on making productive kids
p373
aVand moral kids,
p374
aVand to simply hope that happiness will come to them
p375
aVby virtue of the good that they do
p376
aVand their accomplishments
p377
aVand the love that they feel from us.
p378
aVThat, anyway, is one response to having no script.
p379
aVAbsent having new scripts,
p380
aVwe just follow the oldest ones in the book \u2014
p381
aVdecency, a work ethic, love \u2014
p382
aVand let happiness and self-esteem take care of themselves.
p383
aVI think if we all did that,
p384
aVthe kids would still be all right,
p385
aVand so would their parents,
p386
aVpossibly in both cases even better.
p387
