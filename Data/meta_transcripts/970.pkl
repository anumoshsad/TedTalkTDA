VWelcome to Thailand.
p4
aVNow, when I was a young man \u2014 40 years ago,
p5
aVthe country was very, very poor
p6
aVwith lots and lots and lots of people living in poverty.
p7
aVWe decided to do something about it,
p8
aVbut we didn't begin with a welfare program
p9
aVor a poverty reduction program.
p10
aVBut we began with a family-planning program,
p11
aVfollowing a very successful
p12
aVmaternal child health activity,
p13
aVsets of activities.
p14
aVSo basically, no one would accept family planning
p15
aVif their children didn't survive.
p16
aVSo the first step: get to the children, get to the mothers,
p17
aVand then follow up with family planning.
p18
aVNot just child mortality alone, you need also family planning.
p19
aVNow let me take you back
p20
aVas to why we needed to do it.
p21
aa(lp22
VIn my country, that was the case in 1974.
p23
aVSeven children per family \u2014
p24
aVtremendous growth at 3.3 percent.
p25
aVThere was just no future.
p26
aVWe needed to reduce the population growth rate.
p27
aVSo we said, "Let's do it."
p28
aVThe women said, "We agree. We'll use pills,
p29
aVbut we need a doctor to prescribe the pills,"
p30
aVand we had very, very few doctors.
p31
aVWe didn't take no as an answer;
p32
aVwe took no as a question.
p33
aVWe went to the nurses and the midwives, who were also women,
p34
aVand did a fantastic job
p35
aVat explaining how to use the pill.
p36
aVThat was wonderful,
p37
aVbut it covered only 20 percent of the country.
p38
aa(lp39
VWhat do we do for the other 80 percent \u2014
p40
aVleave them alone and say, "Well, they're not medical personnel."
p41
aVNo, we decided to do a bit more.
p42
aVSo we went to the ordinary people that you saw.
p43
aVActually, below that yellow sign \u2014
p44
aVI wish they hadn't wiped that,
p45
aVbecause there was "Coca-Cola" there.
p46
aVWe were so much bigger than Coca-Cola in those days.
p47
aVAnd no difference,
p48
aVthe people they chose were the people we chose.
p49
aVThey were well-known in the community,
p50
aVthey knew that customers were always right,
p51
aVand they were terrific, and they practiced their family planning themselves.
p52
aVSo they could supply pills and condoms
p53
aVthroughout the country, in every village of the country.
p54
aVSo there we are. We went to the people
p55
aVwho were seen as the cause of the problem
p56
aVto be the solution.
p57
aVWherever there were people \u2014
p58
aVand you can see boats with the women, selling things \u2014
p59
aVhere's the floating market
p60
aVselling bananas and crabs
p61
aVand also contraceptives \u2014
p62
aVwherever you find people,
p63
aVyou'll find contraceptives in Thailand.
p64
aa(lp65
VAnd then we decided, why not get to religion
p66
aVbecause in the Philippines,
p67
aVthe Catholic Church was pretty strong,
p68
aVand Thai people were Buddhist.
p69
aVWe went to them and they said, "Look, could you help us?"
p70
aVI'm there \u2014 the one in blue, not the yellow \u2014
p71
aVholding a bowl of holy water
p72
aVfor the monk to sprinkle holy water
p73
aVon pills and condoms
p74
aVfor the sanctity of the family.
p75
aVAnd this picture was sent throughout the country.
p76
aVSo some of the monks in the villages were doing the same thing themselves.
p77
aVAnd the women were saying, "No wonder we have no side-effects.
p78
aVIt's been blessed."
p79
aVThat was their perception.
p80
aa(lp81
VAnd then we went to teachers.
p82
aVYou need everybody to be involved
p83
aVin trying to provide whatever it is
p84
aVthat make humanity a better place.
p85
aVSo we went to the teachers.
p86
aVOver a quarter of a million were taught about family planning
p87
aVwith a new alphabet \u2014 A, B for birth, C for condom,
p88
aVI for IUD, V for vasectomy.
p89
aVAnd then we had a snakes and ladders game, where you throw dice.
p90
aVIf you land on anything pro-family planning, you move ahead.
p91
aVLike, "Mother takes the pill every night.
p92
aVVery good, mother. Move ahead.
p93
aVUncle buys a condom. Very good, uncle. Move ahead.
p94
aVUncle gets drunk, doesn't use condom. Come back, start again."
p95
aV(Laughter)
p96
aVAgain, education, class entertainment.
p97
aVAnd the kids were doing it in school too.
p98
aVWe had relay races with condoms,
p99
aVwe had children's condom-blowing championship.
p100
aVAnd before long,
p101
aVthe condom was know as the girl's best friend.
p102
aVIn Thailand, for poor people, diamonds don't make it \u2014
p103
aVso the condom is the girl's best friend.
p104
aa(lp105
VWe introduced our first microcredit program in 1975,
p106
aVand the women who organized it said,
p107
aV"We only want to lend
p108
aVto women who practice family planning.
p109
aVIf you're pregnant, take care of your pregnancy.
p110
aVIf you're not pregnant, you can take a loan out from us."
p111
aVAnd that was run by them.
p112
aVAnd after 35/36 years,
p113
aVit's still going on.
p114
aVIt's a part of the Village Development Bank;
p115
aVit's not a real bank, but it's a fund \u2014 microcredit.
p116
aVAnd we didn't need a big organization to run it \u2014
p117
aVit was run by the villagers themselves.
p118
aVAnd you probably hardly see a Thai man there,
p119
aVit's always women, women, women, women.
p120
aVAnd then we thought we'd help America,
p121
aVbecause America's been helping everyone,
p122
aVwhether they want help or not.
p123
aV(Laughter)
p124
aVAnd this is on the Fourth of July.
p125
aVWe decided to provide vasectomy to all men,
p126
aVbut in particular, American men to the front of the queue,
p127
aVright up to the Ambassador's residence
p128
aVduring his [unclear].
p129
aVAnd the hotel gave us the ballroom for it \u2014
p130
aVvery appropriate room.
p131
aV(Laughter)
p132
aVAnd since it was near lunch time,
p133
aVthey said, "All right, we'll give you some lunch.
p134
aVOf course, it must be American cola.
p135
aVYou get two brands, Coke and Pepsi.
p136
aVAnd then the food is either hamburger or hotdog."
p137
aVAnd I thought a hotdog will be more symbolic.
p138
aV(Laughter)
p139
aVAnd here is this, then, young man called Willy Bohm
p140
aVwho worked for the USAID.
p141
aVObviously, he's had his vasectomy
p142
aVbecause his hotdog is half eaten, and he was very happy.
p143
aVIt made a lot of news in America, and it angered some people also.
p144
aVI said, "Don't worry. Come over and I'll do the whole lot of you."
p145
aa(lp146
V(Laughter)
p147
aa(lp148
VAnd what happened?
p149
aVIn all this thing,
p150
aVfrom seven children to 1.5 children,
p151
aVpopulation growth rate of 3.3 to 0.5.
p152
aVYou could call it the Coca-Cola approach if you like \u2014
p153
aVit was exactly the same thing.
p154
aVI'm not sure whether Coca-Cola followed us, or we followed Coca-Cola,
p155
aVbut we're good friends.
p156
aVAnd so that's the case of everyone joining in.
p157
aVWe didn't have a strong government. We didn't have lots of doctors.
p158
aVBut it's everybody's job
p159
aVwho can change attitude and behavior.
p160
aa(lp161
VThen AIDS came along and hit Thailand,
p162
aVand we had to stop doing a lot of good things
p163
aVto fight AIDS.
p164
aVBut unfortunately, the government was in denial, denial, denial.
p165
aVSo our work wasn't affected.
p166
aVSo I thought, "Well, if you can't go to the government, go to the military."
p167
aVSo I went to the military
p168
aVand asked to borrow 300 radio stations.
p169
aVThey have more than the government,
p170
aVand they've got more guns than the government.
p171
aVSo I asked them, could they help us
p172
aVin our fight against HIV.
p173
aVAnd after I gave them statistics,
p174
aVthey said, "Yes. Okay. You can use all the radio stations, television stations."
p175
aVAnd that's when we went onto the airwaves.
p176
aVAnd then we got a new prime minister soon after that.
p177
aVAnd he said, "Mechai, could you come and join?"
p178
aVHe asked me in because he liked my wife a lot.
p179
aVSo I said, "Okay."
p180
aVHe became the chairman of the National AIDS Committee
p181
aVand increased the budget fifty-fold.
p182
aa(lp183
VEvery ministry, even judges, had to be involved in AIDS education \u2014
p184
aVeveryone \u2014 and we said the public, institutions,
p185
aVreligious institutions, schools \u2014
p186
aVeveryone was involved.
p187
aVAnd here, every media person
p188
aVhad to be trained for HIV.
p189
aVAnd we gave every station half a minute extra
p190
aVfor advertising to earn more money.
p191
aVSo they were happy with that.
p192
aVAnd then AIDS education in all schools,
p193
aVstarting from university.
p194
aVAnd these are high school kids teaching high school kids.
p195
aVAnd the best teachers were the girls, not the boys,
p196
aVand they were terrific.
p197
aVAnd these girls who go around teaching about safe sex and HIV
p198
aVwere known as Mother Theresa.
p199
aVAnd then we went down one more step.
p200
aVThese are primary school kids \u2014 third, fourth grade \u2014
p201
aVgoing to every household in the village,
p202
aVevery household in the whole of Thailand,
p203
aVgiving AIDS information and a condom
p204
aVto every household,
p205
aVgiven by these young kids.
p206
aVAnd no parents objected, because we were trying to save lives,
p207
aVand this was a lifesaver.
p208
aVAnd we said, "Everyone needs to be involved."
p209
aa(lp210
VSo you have the companies also realizing
p211
aVthat sick staff don't work, and dead customers don't buy.
p212
aVSo they all trained.
p213
aVAnd then we have this Captain Condom,
p214
aVwith his Harvard MBA,
p215
aVgoing to schools and night spots.
p216
aVAnd they loved him. You need a symbol of something.
p217
aVIn every country, every program, you need a symbol,
p218
aVand this is probably the best thing he's ever done with his MBA.
p219
aV(Laughter)
p220
aVAnd then we gave condoms out everywhere on the streets \u2014
p221
aVeverywhere, everywhere.
p222
aVIn taxis, you get condoms.
p223
aVAnd also, in traffic,
p224
aVthe policemen give you condoms \u2014 our "cops and rubbers" programs.
p225
aV(Laughter)
p226
aVSo, can you imagine New York policemen giving out condoms?
p227
aVOf course I can. And they'd enjoy it immensely;
p228
aVI see them standing around right now, everywhere.
p229
aVImagine if they had condoms,
p230
aVgiving out to all sorts of people.
p231
aVAnd then, new change,
p232
aVwe had hair bands, clothing
p233
aVand the condom for your mobile phone
p234
aVduring the rainy season.
p235
aa(lp236
V(Laughter)
p237
aa(lp238
VAnd these were the condoms that we introduced.
p239
aVOne says, "Weapon of mass protection."
p240
aVWe found \u2014
p241
aVyou know \u2014 somebody here was searching for the weapon of mass destruction,
p242
aVbut we have found the weapon of mass protection: the condom.
p243
aVAnd then it says here, with the American flag,
p244
aV"Don't leave home without it."
p245
aVBut I have some to give out afterward.
p246
aVBut let me warn you, these are Thai-sized,
p247
aVso be very careful.
p248
aV(Laughter)
p249
aVAnd so you can see
p250
aVthat condoms can do so many things.
p251
aVLook at this \u2014
p252
aVI gave this to Al Gore and to Bill Senior also.
p253
aVStop global warming; use condoms.
p254
aVAnd then this is the picture I mentioned to you \u2014
p255
aVthe weapon of mass protection.
p256
aVAnd let the next Olympics save some lives.
p257
aVWhy just run around?
p258
aV(Laughter)
p259
aVAnd then finally,
p260
aVin Thailand we're Buddhist, we don't have a God,
p261
aVso instead, we say, "In rubber we trust."
p262
aV(Laughter)
p263
aVSo you can see that we added everything to our endeavor
p264
aVto make life better for the people.
p265
aVWe had condoms in all the refrigerators in the hotels and the schools,
p266
aVbecause alcohol impairs judgment.
p267
aa(lp268
VAnd then what happened?
p269
aVAfter all this time, everybody joined in.
p270
aVAccording to the U.N.,
p271
aVnew cases of HIV
p272
aVdeclined by 90 percent,
p273
aVand according to the World Bank,
p274
aV7.7 million lives were saved.
p275
aVOtherwise there wouldn't be many Thais walking around today.
p276
aVSo it just showed you, you could do something about it.
p277
aV90 percent of the funding came from Thailand.
p278
aVThere was political commitment, some financial commitment,
p279
aVand everybody joined in the fight.
p280
aVSo just don't leave it to the specialists and doctors and nurses.
p281
aVWe all need to help.
p282
aa(lp283
VAnd then we decided to help people out of poverty,
p284
aVnow that we got AIDS somewhat out of the way \u2014
p285
aVthis time, not with government alone,
p286
aVbut in cooperation with the business community.
p287
aVBecause poor people are business people
p288
aVwho lack business skills and access to credit.
p289
aVThose are the things to be provided by the business community.
p290
aVWe're trying to turn them into barefoot entrepreneurs,
p291
aVlittle business people.
p292
aVThe only way out of poverty is through business enterprise.
p293
aVSo, that was done.
p294
aVThe money goes from the company into the village
p295
aVvia tree-planting.
p296
aVIt's not a free gift.
p297
aVThey plant the trees, and the money goes into their microcredit fund,
p298
aVwhich we call the Village Development Bank.
p299
aVEverybody joins in,
p300
aVand they feel they own the bank,
p301
aVbecause they have brought the money in.
p302
aa(lp303
VAnd before you can borrow the money, you need to be trained.
p304
aVAnd we believe if you want to help the poor,
p305
aVthose who are living in poverty,
p306
aVaccess to credit must be a human right.
p307
aVAccess to credit must be a human right.
p308
aVOtherwise they'll never get out of poverty.
p309
aVAnd then before getting a loan, you must be trained.
p310
aVHere's what we call a "barefoot MBA,"
p311
aVteaching people how to do business
p312
aVso that, when they borrow money, they'll succeed with the business.
p313
aVThese are some of the businesses:
p314
aVmushrooms, crabs, vegetables,
p315
aVtrees, fruits,
p316
aVand this is very interesting \u2014 Nike ice cream and Nike biscuits;
p317
aVthis is a village sponsored by Nike.
p318
aVThey said, "They should stop making shoes and clothes.
p319
aVMake these better, because we can afford them."
p320
aVAnd then we have silk, Thai silk.
p321
aVNow we're making Scottish tartans, as you can see on the left,
p322
aVto sell to all people of Scottish ancestors.
p323
aVSo anyone sitting in and watching TV,
p324
aVget in touch with me.
p325
aVAnd then this is our answer to Starbucks in Thailand \u2014
p326
aV"Coffee and Condoms."
p327
aVSee, Starbucks you awake, we keep you awake and alive.
p328
aVThat's the difference.
p329
aVCan you imagine, at every Starbucks
p330
aVthat you can also get condoms?
p331
aVYou can order your condoms with your with your cappuccino.
p332
aa(lp333
VAnd then now, finally in education,
p334
aVwe want to change the school as being underutilized
p335
aVinto a place where it's a lifelong learning center for everyone.
p336
aVWe call this our School-Based Integrated Rural Development.
p337
aVAnd it's a center, a focal point
p338
aVfor economic and social development.
p339
aVRe-do the school,
p340
aVmake it serve the community needs.
p341
aVAnd here is a bamboo building \u2014
p342
aVall of them are bamboo.
p343
aVThis is a geodesic dome made of bamboo.
p344
aVAnd I'm sure Buckminster Fuller would be very, very proud
p345
aVto see a bamboo geodesic dome.
p346
aVAnd we use vegetables around the school ground,
p347
aVso they raise their own vegetables.
p348
aa(lp349
VAnd then, finally, I firmly believe,
p350
aVif we want the MDGs to work \u2014
p351
aVthe Millennium Development Goals \u2014
p352
aVwe need to add family planning to it.
p353
aVOf course, child mortality first and then family planning \u2014
p354
aVeveryone needs family planning service \u2014
p355
aVit's underutilized.
p356
aVSo we have now found the weapon of mass protection.
p357
aVAnd we also ask the next Olympics
p358
aVto be involved in saving lives.
p359
aVAnd then, finally, that is our network.
p360
aVAnd these are our Thai tulips.
p361
aa(lp362
V(Laughter)
p363
aa(lp364
VThank you very much indeed.
