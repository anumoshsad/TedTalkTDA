VSo, a few years ago I was at JFK Airport
p4
aVabout to get on a flight,
p5
aVwhen I was approached by two women
p6
aVwho I do not think would be insulted
p7
aVto hear themselves described
p8
aVas tiny old tough-talking Italian-American broads.
p9
aa(lp10
VThe taller one, who is like up here,
p11
aVshe comes marching up to me, and she goes,
p12
aV"Honey, I gotta ask you something.
p13
aVYou got something to do with that whole
p14
aV'Eat, Pray, Love' thing that's been going on lately?"
p15
aa(lp16
VAnd I said, "Yes, I did."
p17
aa(lp18
VAnd she smacks her friend and she goes,
p19
aV"See, I told you, I said, that's that girl.
p20
aVThat's that girl who wrote that book
p21
aVbased on that movie."
p22
aV(Laughter)
p23
aa(lp24
VSo that's who I am.
p25
aVAnd believe me, I'm extremely grateful to be that person,
p26
aVbecause that whole "Eat, Pray, Love" thing
p27
aVwas a huge break for me.
p28
aVBut it also left me in a really tricky position
p29
aVmoving forward as an author
p30
aVtrying to figure out how in the world
p31
aVI was ever going to write a book again
p32
aVthat would ever please anybody,
p33
aVbecause I knew well in advance
p34
aVthat all of those people who had adored "Eat, Pray, Love"
p35
aVwere going to be incredibly disappointed
p36
aVin whatever I wrote next
p37
aVbecause it wasn't going to be "Eat, Pray, Love,"
p38
aVand all of those people who had hated "Eat, Pray, Love"
p39
aVwere going to be incredibly disappointed
p40
aVin whatever I wrote next
p41
aVbecause it would provide evidence that I still lived.
p42
aVSo I knew that I had no way to win,
p43
aVand knowing that I had no way to win
p44
aVmade me seriously consider for a while
p45
aVjust quitting the game
p46
aVand moving to the country to raise corgis.
p47
aVBut if I had done that, if I had given up writing,
p48
aVI would have lost my beloved vocation,
p49
aVso I knew that the task was that I had to find
p50
aVsome way to gin up the inspiration
p51
aVto write the next book
p52
aVregardless of its inevitable negative outcome.
p53
aVIn other words, I had to find a way to make sure
p54
aVthat my creativity survived its own success.
p55
aVAnd I did, in the end, find that inspiration,
p56
aVbut I found it in the most unlikely
p57
aVand unexpected place.
p58
aVI found it in lessons that I had learned earlier in life
p59
aVabout how creativity can survive its own failure.
p60
aa(lp61
VSo just to back up and explain,
p62
aVthe only thing I have ever wanted to be
p63
aVfor my whole life was a writer.
p64
aVI wrote all through childhood, all through adolescence,
p65
aVby the time I was a teenager I was sending
p66
aVmy very bad stories to The New Yorker,
p67
aVhoping to be discovered.
p68
aVAfter college, I got a job as a diner waitress,
p69
aVkept working, kept writing,
p70
aVkept trying really hard to get published,
p71
aVand failing at it.
p72
aVI failed at getting published
p73
aVfor almost six years.
p74
aVSo for almost six years, every single day,
p75
aVI had nothing but rejection letters
p76
aVwaiting for me in my mailbox.
p77
aVAnd it was devastating every single time,
p78
aVand every single time, I had to ask myself
p79
aVif I should just quit while I was behind
p80
aVand give up and spare myself this pain.
p81
aVBut then I would find my resolve,
p82
aVand always in the same way,
p83
aVby saying, "I'm not going to quit,
p84
aVI'm going home."
p85
aa(lp86
VAnd you have to understand that for me,
p87
aVgoing home did not mean returning to my family's farm.
p88
aVFor me, going home
p89
aVmeant returning to the work of writing
p90
aVbecause writing was my home,
p91
aVbecause I loved writing more than I hated failing at writing,
p92
aVwhich is to say that I loved writing
p93
aVmore than I loved my own ego,
p94
aVwhich is ultimately to say
p95
aVthat I loved writing more than I loved myself.
p96
aVAnd that's how I pushed through it.
p97
aa(lp98
VBut the weird thing is that 20 years later,
p99
aVduring the crazy ride of "Eat, Pray, Love,"
p100
aVI found myself identifying all over again
p101
aVwith that unpublished young diner waitress
p102
aVwho I used to be, thinking about her constantly,
p103
aVand feeling like I was her again,
p104
aVwhich made no rational sense whatsoever
p105
aVbecause our lives could not have been more different.
p106
aVShe had failed constantly.
p107
aVI had succeeded beyond my wildest expectation.
p108
aVWe had nothing in common.
p109
aVWhy did I suddenly feel like I was her all over again?
p110
aa(lp111
VAnd it was only when I was trying to unthread that
p112
aVthat I finally began to comprehend
p113
aVthe strange and unlikely psychological connection
p114
aVin our lives between the way we experience great failure
p115
aVand the way we experience great success.
p116
aVSo think of it like this:
p117
aVFor most of your life, you live out your existence
p118
aVhere in the middle of the chain of human experience
p119
aVwhere everything is normal and reassuring and regular,
p120
aVbut failure catapults you abruptly way out over here
p121
aVinto the blinding darkness of disappointment.
p122
aVSuccess catapults you just as abruptly but just as far
p123
aVway out over here
p124
aVinto the equally blinding glare
p125
aVof fame and recognition and praise.
p126
aVAnd one of these fates
p127
aVis objectively seen by the world as bad,
p128
aVand the other one is objectively seen by the world as good,
p129
aVbut your subconscious is completely incapable
p130
aVof discerning the difference between bad and good.
p131
aVThe only thing that it is capable of feeling
p132
aVis the absolute value of this emotional equation,
p133
aVthe exact distance that you have been flung
p134
aVfrom yourself.
p135
aVAnd there's a real equal danger in both cases
p136
aVof getting lost out there
p137
aVin the hinterlands of the psyche.
p138
aa(lp139
VBut in both cases, it turns out that there is
p140
aValso the same remedy for self-restoration,
p141
aVand that is that you have got to find your way back home again
p142
aVas swiftly and smoothly as you can,
p143
aVand if you're wondering what your home is,
p144
aVhere's a hint:
p145
aVYour home is whatever in this world you love
p146
aVmore than you love yourself.
p147
aVSo that might be creativity, it might be family,
p148
aVit might be invention, adventure,
p149
aVfaith, service, it might be raising corgis,
p150
aVI don't know, your home is that thing
p151
aVto which you can dedicate your energies
p152
aVwith such singular devotion
p153
aVthat the ultimate results become inconsequential.
p154
aa(lp155
VFor me, that home has always been writing.
p156
aVSo after the weird, disorienting success
p157
aVthat I went through with "Eat, Pray, Love,"
p158
aVI realized that all I had to do was exactly
p159
aVthe same thing that I used to have to do all the time
p160
aVwhen I was an equally disoriented failure.
p161
aVI had to get my ass back to work,
p162
aVand that's what I did, and that's how, in 2010,
p163
aVI was able to publish the dreaded follow-up
p164
aVto "Eat, Pray, Love."
p165
aVAnd you know what happened with that book?
p166
aVIt bombed, and I was fine.
p167
aVActually, I kind of felt bulletproof,
p168
aVbecause I knew that I had broken the spell
p169
aVand I had found my way back home
p170
aVto writing for the sheer devotion of it.
p171
aVAnd I stayed in my home of writing after that,
p172
aVand I wrote another book that just came out last year
p173
aVand that one was really beautifully received,
p174
aVwhich is very nice, but not my point.
p175
aVMy point is that I'm writing another one now,
p176
aVand I'll write another book after that
p177
aVand another and another and another
p178
aVand many of them will fail,
p179
aVand some of them might succeed,
p180
aVbut I will always be safe
p181
aVfrom the random hurricanes of outcome
p182
aVas long as I never forget where I rightfully live.
p183
aa(lp184
VLook, I don't know where you rightfully live,
p185
aVbut I know that there's something in this world
p186
aVthat you love more than you love yourself.
p187
aVSomething worthy, by the way,
p188
aVso addiction and infatuation don't count,
p189
aVbecause we all know that those are not safe places to live. Right?
p190
aVThe only trick is that you've got to identify
p191
aVthe best, worthiest thing that you love most,
p192
aVand then build your house right on top of it
p193
aVand don't budge from it.
p194
aVAnd if you should someday, somehow
p195
aVget vaulted out of your home
p196
aVby either great failure or great success,
p197
aVthen your job is to fight your way back to that home
p198
aVthe only way that it has ever been done,
p199
aVby putting your head down and performing
p200
aVwith diligence and devotion
p201
aVand respect and reverence
p202
aVwhatever the task is that love
p203
aVis calling forth from you next.
p204
aVYou just do that, and keep doing that
p205
aVagain and again and again,
p206
aVand I can absolutely promise you, from long personal experience
p207
aVin every direction, I can assure you
p208
aVthat it's all going to be okay.
p209
aVThank you.
