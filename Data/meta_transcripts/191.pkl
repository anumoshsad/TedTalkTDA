VSo, I guess it is a result of globalization

p6
aa(lp7
V(Laughter)
p8
aa(lp9
VAnd so I just came, two days ago, from the Himalayas
p10
aVto your kind invitation.
p11
aVSo I would like to invite you, also, for a while, to the Himalayas themselves.
p12
aVAnd to show the place where meditators, like me,
p13
aVwho began with being a molecular biologist in Pasteur Institute,
p14
aVand found their way to the mountains.
p15
aa(lp16
VSo these are a few images I was lucky to take and be there.
p17
aVThere's Mount Kailash in Eastern Tibet \u2014 wonderful setting.
p18
aVThis is from Marlboro country.
p19
aa(lp20
V(Laughter)
p21
aa(lp22
VThis is a turquoise lake.
p23
aVA meditator.
p24
aVThis is the hottest day of the year somewhere in Eastern Tibet, on August 1.
p25
aVAnd the night before, we camped, and my Tibetan friends said,
p26
aV"We are going to sleep outside."
p27
aVAnd I said, "Why? We have enough space in the tent."
p28
aVThey said, "Yes, but it's summertime."
p29
aa(lp30
V(Laughter)
p31
aa(lp32
VSo now, we are going to speak of happiness.
p33
aVAs a Frenchman, I must say
p34
aVthat there are a lot of French intellectuals
p35
aVthat think happiness is not at all interesting.
p36
aa(lp37
V(Laughter)
p38
aa(lp39
VI just wrote an essay on happiness, and there was a controversy.
p40
aVAnd someone wrote an article saying,
p41
aV"Don't impose on us the dirty work of happiness."
p42
aa(lp43
V(Laughter)
p44
aa(lp45
V"We don't care about being happy. We need to live with passion.
p46
aVWe like the ups and downs of life.
p47
aVWe like our suffering because it's so good when it ceases for a while."
p48
aa(lp49
V(Laughter)
p50
aa(lp51
VThis is what I see from the balcony of my hermitage in the Himalayas.
p52
aVIt's about two meters by three, and you are all welcome any time.
p53
aa(lp54
V(Laughter)
p55
aa(lp56
VNow, let's come to happiness or well-being.
p57
aVAnd first of all, you know, despite what the French intellectuals say,
p58
aVit seems that no one wakes up in the morning thinking,
p59
aV"May I suffer the whole day?"
p60
aa(lp61
V(Laughter)
p62
aa(lp63
VWhich means that somehow, consciously or not,
p64
aVdirectly or indirectly, in the short or the long term,
p65
aVwhatever we do, whatever we hope, whatever we dream \u2014
p66
aVsomehow, is related to a deep, profound desire for well-being or happiness.
p67
aVAs Pascal said, even the one who hangs himself,
p68
aVsomehow, is looking for cessation of suffering.
p69
aVHe finds no other way.
p70
aVBut then, if you look in the literature, East and West,
p71
aVyou can find incredible diversity of definition of happiness.
p72
aVSome people say, I only believed in remembering the past,
p73
aVimagining the future, never the present.
p74
aVSome people say happiness is right now;
p75
aVit's the quality of the freshness of the present moment.
p76
aVAnd that led Henri Bergson, the French philosopher, to say,
p77
aV"All the great thinkers of humanity have left happiness in the vague
p78
aVso that each of them could define their own terms."
p79
aa(lp80
VWell, that would be fine if it was just a secondary preoccupation in life.
p81
aVBut now, if it is something that is going to determine
p82
aVthe quality of every instant of our life,
p83
aVthen we better know what it is, have some clearer idea.
p84
aVAnd probably, the fact that we don't know that is why, so often,
p85
aValthough we seek happiness, it seems we turn our back to it.
p86
aVAlthough we want to avoid suffering,
p87
aVit seems we are running somewhat towards it.
p88
aVAnd that can also come from some kind of confusions.
p89
aa(lp90
VOne of the most common ones is happiness and pleasure.
p91
aVBut if you look at the characteristics of those two,
p92
aVpleasure is contingent upon time, upon its object,
p93
aVupon the place.
p94
aVIt is something that \u2014 changes of nature.
p95
aVBeautiful chocolate cake: first serving is delicious,
p96
aVsecond one not so much, then we feel disgust.
p97
aa(lp98
V(Laughter)
p99
aa(lp100
VThat's the nature of things.
p101
aVWe get tired.
p102
aVI used to be a fan of Bach.
p103
aVI used to play it on the guitar, you know.
p104
aVI can hear it two, three, five times.
p105
aVIf I had to hear it 24 hours, non-stop, it might be very tiring.
p106
aVIf you are feeling very cold, you come near a fire, it's so wonderful.
p107
aVAfter some moments, you just go a little back,
p108
aVand then it starts burning.
p109
aVIt sort of uses itself as you experience it.
p110
aVAnd also, again, it can \u2014 also, it's something that you \u2014
p111
aVit is not something that is radiating outside.
p112
aVLike, you can feel intense pleasure
p113
aVand some others around you can be suffering a lot.
p114
aa(lp115
VNow, what, then, will be happiness?
p116
aVAnd happiness, of course, is such a vague word, so let's say well-being.
p117
aVAnd so, I think the best definition, according to the Buddhist view,
p118
aVis that well-being is not just a mere pleasurable sensation.
p119
aVIt is a deep sense of serenity and fulfillment.
p120
aVA state that actually pervades
p121
aVand underlies all emotional states,
p122
aVand all the joys and sorrows that can come one's way.
p123
aVFor you, that might be surprising.
p124
aVCan we have this kind of well-being while being sad?
p125
aVIn a way, why not?
p126
aVBecause we are speaking of a different level.
p127
aa(lp128
VLook at the waves coming near the shore.
p129
aVWhen you are at the bottom of the wave, you hit the bottom.
p130
aVYou hit the solid rock.
p131
aVWhen you are surfing on the top, you are all elated.
p132
aVSo you go from elation to depression \u2014 there's no depth.
p133
aVNow, if you look at the high sea,
p134
aVthere might be beautiful, calm ocean, like a mirror.
p135
aVThere might be storms,
p136
aVbut the depth of the ocean is still there, unchanged.
p137
aVSo now, how is that?
p138
aVIt can only be a state of being, not just a fleeting emotion, sensation.
p139
aVEven joy \u2014 that can be the spring of happiness.
p140
aVBut there's also wicked joy, you can rejoice in someone's suffering.
p141
aa(lp142
VSo how do we proceed in our quest for happiness?
p143
aVVery often, we look outside.
p144
aVWe think that if we could gather this and that, all the conditions,
p145
aVsomething that we say, "Everything to be happy \u2014
p146
aVto have everything to be happy."
p147
aVThat very sentence already reveals the doom, destruction of happiness.
p148
aVTo have everything.
p149
aVIf we miss something, it collapses.
p150
aVAnd also, when things go wrong, we try to fix the outside so much,
p151
aVbut our control of the outer world is limited,
p152
aVtemporary, and often, illusory.
p153
aVSo now, look at inner conditions.
p154
aVAren't they stronger?
p155
aVIsn't it the mind that translates
p156
aVthe outer condition into happiness and suffering?
p157
aVAnd isn't that stronger?
p158
aVWe know, by experience,
p159
aVthat we can be what we call "a little paradise,"
p160
aVand yet, be completely unhappy within.
p161
aa(lp162
VThe Dalai Lama was once in Portugal,
p163
aVand there was a lot of construction going on everywhere.
p164
aVSo one evening, he said, "Look, you are doing all these things,
p165
aVbut isn't it nice, also, to build something within?"
p166
aVAnd he said, "[Without] that \u2014 even if you get a high-tech flat
p167
aVon the 100th floor of a super-modern and comfortable building,
p168
aVif you are deeply unhappy within,
p169
aVall you are going to look for is a window from which to jump."
p170
aVSo now, at the opposite,
p171
aVwe know a lot of people who, in very difficult circumstances,
p172
aVmanage to keep serenity, inner strength, inner freedom, confidence.
p173
aVSo now, if the inner conditions are stronger \u2014
p174
aVof course, the outer conditions do influence,
p175
aVand it's wonderful to live longer, healthier,
p176
aVto have access to information, education,
p177
aVto be able to travel, to have freedom.
p178
aVIt's highly desirable.
p179
aVHowever, this is not enough.
p180
aVThose are just auxiliary, help conditions.
p181
aVThe experience that translates everything is within the mind.
p182
aVSo then, when we ask oneself
p183
aVhow to nurture the condition for happiness,
p184
aVthe inner conditions, and which are those which will undermine happiness.
p185
aVSo then, this just needs to have some experience.
p186
aa(lp187
VWe have to know from ourselves, there are certain states of mind
p188
aVthat are conducive to this flourishing, to this well-being,
p189
aVwhat the Greeks called eudaimonia, flourishing.
p190
aVThere are some which are adverse to this well-being.
p191
aVAnd so, if we look from our own experience,
p192
aVanger, hatred, jealousy, arrogance,
p193
aVobsessive desire, strong grasping,
p194
aVthey don't leave us in such a good state after we have experienced it.
p195
aVAnd also, they are detrimental to others' happiness.
p196
aVSo we may consider that the more those are invading our mind,
p197
aVand, like a chain reaction,
p198
aVthe more we feel miserable, we feel tormented.
p199
aVAt the opposite, everyone knows deep within
p200
aVthat an act of selfless generosity,
p201
aVif from the distance, without anyone knowing anything about it,
p202
aVwe could save a child's life, make someone happy.
p203
aVWe don't need the recognition. We don't need any gratitude.
p204
aVJust the mere fact of doing that
p205
aVfills such a sense of adequation with our deep nature.
p206
aVAnd we would like to be like that all the time.
p207
aa(lp208
VSo is that possible,
p209
aVto change our way of being, to transform one's mind?
p210
aVAren't those negative emotions, or destructive emotions,
p211
aVinherent to the nature of mind?
p212
aVIs change possible in our emotions, in our traits, in our moods?
p213
aVFor that we have to ask, what is the nature of mind?
p214
aVAnd if we look from the experiential point of view,
p215
aVthere is a primary quality of consciousness
p216
aVthat's just the mere fact to be cognitive, to be aware.
p217
aVConsciousness is like a mirror that allows all images to rise on it.
p218
aVYou can have ugly faces, beautiful faces in the mirror.
p219
aVThe mirror allows that, but the mirror is not tainted,
p220
aVis not modified, is not altered by those images.
p221
aVLikewise, behind every single thought
p222
aVthere is the bare consciousness, pure awareness.
p223
aVThis is the nature.
p224
aVIt cannot be tainted intrinsically with hatred or jealousy because then,
p225
aVif it was always there \u2014
p226
aVlike a dye that would permeate the whole cloth \u2014
p227
aVthen it would be found all the time, somewhere.
p228
aVWe know we're not always angry, always jealous, always generous.
p229
aa(lp230
VSo, because the basic fabric of consciousness
p231
aVis this pure cognitive quality that differentiates it from a stone,
p232
aVthere is a possibility for change because all emotions are fleeting.
p233
aVThat is the ground for mind training.
p234
aVMind training is based on the idea that two opposite mental factors
p235
aVcannot happen at the same time.
p236
aVYou could go from love to hate.
p237
aVBut you cannot, at the same time, toward the same object,
p238
aVthe same person, want to harm and want to do good.
p239
aVYou cannot, in the same gesture, shake hand and give a blow.
p240
aVSo, there are natural antidotes to emotions
p241
aVthat are destructive to our inner well-being.
p242
aVSo that's the way to proceed.
p243
aVRejoicing compared to jealousy.
p244
aVA kind of sense of inner freedom
p245
aVas opposite to intense grasping and obsession.
p246
aVBenevolence, loving kindness against hatred.
p247
aVBut, of course, each emotion then would need a particular antidote.
p248
aa(lp249
VAnother way is to try to find a general antidote to all emotions,
p250
aVand that's by looking at the very nature.
p251
aVUsually, when we feel annoyed, hatred or upset with someone,
p252
aVor obsessed with something,
p253
aVthe mind goes again and again to that object.
p254
aVEach time it goes to the object,
p255
aVit reinforces that obsession or that annoyance.
p256
aVSo then, it's a self-perpetuating process.
p257
aVSo what we need to look for now is,
p258
aVinstead of looking outward, we look inward.
p259
aVLook at anger itself.
p260
aVIt looks very menacing,
p261
aVlike a billowing monsoon cloud or thunderstorm.
p262
aVWe think we could sit on the cloud,
p263
aVbut if you go there, it's just mist.
p264
aVLikewise, if you look at the thought of anger,
p265
aVit will vanish like frost under the morning sun.
p266
aVIf you do this again and again, the propensity,
p267
aVthe tendencies for anger to arise again
p268
aVwill be less and less each time you dissolve it.
p269
aVAnd, at the end, although it may rise,
p270
aVit will just cross the mind,
p271
aVlike a bird crossing the sky without leaving any track.
p272
aVSo this is the principal of mind training.
p273
aa(lp274
VNow, it takes time,
p275
aVbecause it took time for all those faults in our mind, the tendencies, to build up,
p276
aVso it will take time to unfold them as well.
p277
aVBut that's the only way to go.
p278
aVMind transformation \u2014 that is the very meaning of meditation.
p279
aVIt means familiarization with a new way of being,
p280
aVnew way of perceiving things,
p281
aVwhich is more in adequation with reality,
p282
aVwith interdependence, with the stream and continuous transformation,
p283
aVwhich our being and our consciousness is.
p284
aa(lp285
VSo, the interface with cognitive science,
p286
aVsince we need to come to that, it was, I suppose, the subject of \u2014
p287
aVwe have to deal in such a short time \u2014 with brain plasticity.
p288
aVThe brain was thought to be more or less fixed.
p289
aVAll the nominal connections, in numbers and quantities,
p290
aVwere thought, until the last 20 years,
p291
aVto be more or less fixed when we reached adult age.
p292
aVNow, recently, it has been found that it can change a lot.
p293
aVA violinist, as we heard, who has done 10,000 hours of violin practice,
p294
aVsome area that controls the movements of fingers in the brain changes a lot,
p295
aVincreasing reinforcement of the synaptic connections.
p296
aVSo can we do that with human qualities?
p297
aVWith loving kindness, with patience, with openness?
p298
aa(lp299
VSo that's what those great meditators have been doing.
p300
aVSome of them who came to the labs,
p301
aVlike in Madison, Wisconsin, or in Berkeley,
p302
aVdid 20 to 40,000 hours of meditation.
p303
aVThey do, like, three years' retreat, where they do meditate 12 hours a day.
p304
aVAnd then, the rest of their life, they will do three or four hours a day.
p305
aVThey are real Olympic champions of mind training.
p306
aa(lp307
V(Laughter)
p308
aa(lp309
VThis is the place where the meditators \u2014 you can see it's kind of inspiring.
p310
aVNow, here with 256 electrodes.
p311
aa(lp312
V(Laughter)
p313
aa(lp314
VSo what did they find?
p315
aVOf course, same thing.
p316
aVThe scientific embargo \u2014
p317
aVif it's ever submitted to "Nature," hopefully, it will be accepted.
p318
aVIt deals with the state of compassion, unconditional compassion.
p319
aVWe asked meditators, who have been doing that for years and years,
p320
aVto put their mind in a state where there's nothing but loving kindness,
p321
aVtotal availability to sentient being.
p322
aVOf course, during the training, we do that with objects.
p323
aVWe think of people suffering, of people we love,
p324
aVbut at some point, it can be a state which is all pervading.
p325
aVHere is the preliminary result,
p326
aVwhich I can show because it's already been shown.
p327
aVThe bell curve shows 150 controls,
p328
aVand what is being looked at
p329
aVis the difference between the right and the left frontal lobe.
p330
aVIn very short, people who have more activity
p331
aVin the right side of the prefrontal cortex
p332
aVare more depressed, withdrawn.
p333
aVThey don't describe a lot of positive affect.
p334
aVIt's the opposite on the left side:
p335
aVmore tendency to altruism,
p336
aVto happiness, to express, and curiosity and so forth.
p337
aVSo there's a basic line for people. And also, it can be changed.
p338
aVIf you see a comic movie, you go off to the left side.
p339
aVIf you are happy about something, you'll go more to the left side.
p340
aVIf you have a bout of depression, you'll go to the right side.
p341
aVHere, the -0.5 is the full standard deviation
p342
aVof a meditator who meditated on compassion.
p343
aVIt's something that is totally out of the bell curve.
p344
aa(lp345
VSo, I've no time to go into all the different scientific results.
p346
aVHopefully, they will come.
p347
aVBut they found that \u2014 this is after three and a half hours
p348
aVin an fMRI,
p349
aVit's like coming out of a space ship.
p350
aVAlso, it has been shown in other labs \u2014
p351
aVfor instance, Paul Ekman's labs in Berkeley \u2014
p352
aVthat some meditators are able, also,
p353
aVto control their emotional response more than it could be thought.
p354
aVLike the startle experiments, for example.
p355
aVIf you sit a guy on a chair
p356
aVwith all this apparatus measuring your physiology,
p357
aVand there's kind of a bomb that goes off,
p358
aVit's such an instinctive response that,
p359
aVin 20 years, they never saw anyone who would not jump.
p360
aVSome meditators, without trying to stop it,
p361
aVbut simply by being completely open,
p362
aVthinking that that bang is just going to be a small event like a shooting star,
p363
aVthey are able not to move at all.
p364
aa(lp365
VSo the whole point of that is not, sort of, to make, like,
p366
aVa circus thing of showing exceptional beings who can jump, or whatever.
p367
aVIt's more to say that mind training matters.
p368
aVThat this is not just a luxury.
p369
aVThis is not a supplementary vitamin for the soul.
p370
aVThis is something that's going to determine
p371
aVthe quality of every instant of our lives.
p372
aVWe are ready to spend 15 years achieving education.
p373
aVWe love to do jogging, fitness.
p374
aVWe do all kinds of things to remain beautiful.
p375
aVYet, we spend surprisingly little time taking care of what matters most \u2014
p376
aVthe way our mind functions \u2014
p377
aVwhich, again, is the ultimate thing
p378
aVthat determines the quality of our experience.
p379
aa(lp380
VNow, compassion is supposed to be put in action.
p381
aVThat's what we try to do in different places.
p382
aVJust this one example is worth a lot of work.
p383
aVThis lady with bone TB, left alone in a tent,
p384
aVwas going to die with her only daughter.
p385
aVOne year later, how she is.
p386
aVDifferent schools and clinics we've been doing in Tibet.
p387
aa(lp388
VAnd just, I leave you with the beauty of those looks
p389
aVthat tells more about happiness than I could ever say.
