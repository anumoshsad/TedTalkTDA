VI was born in Switzerland
p4
aVand raised in Ghana, West Africa.
p5
aVGhana felt safe to me as a child.
p6
aVI was free, I was happy.
p7
aVThe early 70s
p8
aVmarked a time of musical and artistic excellence in Ghana.
p9
aVBut then by the end of the decade,
p10
aVthe country had fallen back into political instability
p11
aVand mismanagement.
p12
aa(lp13
VIn 1979,
p14
aVI witnessed my first military coup.
p15
aVWe the children had gathered at a friend's house.
p16
aVIt was a dimly lit shack.
p17
aVThere was a beaten up black and white television
p18
aVflickering in the background,
p19
aVand a former head of state and general
p20
aVwas being blindfolded
p21
aVand tied to the pole.
p22
aVThe firing squad aimed, fired \u2014
p23
aVthe general was dead.
p24
aVNow this was being broadcast live.
p25
aVAnd shortly after, we left the country,
p26
aVand we returned to Switzerland.
p27
aa(lp28
VNow Europe came as a shock to me,
p29
aVand I think I started feeling the need
p30
aVto shed my skin in order to fit in.
p31
aVI wanted to blend in like a chameleon.
p32
aVI think it was a tactic of survival.
p33
aVAnd it worked, or so I believed.
p34
aa(lp35
VSo here I was in 2008
p36
aVwondering where I was in my life.
p37
aVAnd I felt I was being typecast as an actor.
p38
aVI was always playing the exotic African.
p39
aVI was playing the violent African,
p40
aVthe African terrorist.
p41
aVAnd I was thinking,
p42
aVhow many terrorists could I possibly play
p43
aVbefore turning into one myself?
p44
aVAnd I had become ashamed of the other,
p45
aVthe African in me.
p46
aVAnd fortunately I decided in 2008
p47
aVto return to Ghana,
p48
aVafter 28 years of absence.
p49
aVI wanted to document on film
p50
aVthe 2008 presidential elections.
p51
aVAnd there, I started by searching
p52
aVfor the footprints in my childhood.
p53
aVAnd before I even knew it,
p54
aVI was suddenly on a stage
p55
aVsurrounded by thousands of cheering people
p56
aVduring a political rally.
p57
aa(lp58
VAnd I realized that, when I'd left the country,
p59
aVfree and fair elections in a democratic environment
p60
aVwere a dream.
p61
aVAnd now that I'd returned, that dream had become reality,
p62
aVthough a fragile reality.
p63
aVAnd I was thinking,
p64
aVwas Ghana searching for its identity
p65
aVlike I was looking for my identity?
p66
aVWas what was happening in Ghana a metaphor
p67
aVfor what was happening in me?
p68
aVAnd it was as if through the standards of my Western life,
p69
aVI hadn't lived up to my full potential.
p70
aVI mean, nor had Ghana,
p71
aVeven though we had been trying very hard.
p72
aa(lp73
VNow in 1957,
p74
aVGhana was the first sub-Saharan country
p75
aVto gain its independence.
p76
aVIn the late 50s,
p77
aVGhana and Singapore had the same GDP.
p78
aVI mean, today, Singapore is a First World country
p79
aVand Ghana is not.
p80
aVBut maybe it was time to prove to myself,
p81
aVyes, it's important to understand the past,
p82
aVit is important to look at it in a different light,
p83
aVbut maybe we should look at the strengths in our own culture
p84
aVand build on those foundations in the present.
p85
aa(lp86
VSo here I was, December 7th, 2008.
p87
aVThe polling stations opened to the voters at 7:00 AM,
p88
aVbut voters, eager to take their own political fate into their hands,
p89
aVwere starting to line up at 4:00 AM in the morning.
p90
aVAnd they had traveled from near, they had traveled from far,
p91
aVbecause they wanted to make their voices heard.
p92
aVAnd I asked one of the voters, I said, "Whom are you going to vote for?"
p93
aVAnd he said, "I'm sorry, I can't tell you."
p94
aVHe said that his vote was in his heart.
p95
aVAnd I understood, this was their election,
p96
aVand they weren't going to let anyone
p97
aVtake it away from them.
p98
aa(lp99
VNow the first round of the voting didn't bring forth a clear winner \u2014
p100
aVso nobody had achieved the absolute majority \u2014
p101
aVso voting went into a second round three weeks later.
p102
aVThe candidates were back on the road; they were campaigning.
p103
aVThe rhetoric of the candidates, of course, changed.
p104
aVThe heat was on.
p105
aVAnd then the cliche came to haunt us.
p106
aVThere were claims of intimidation
p107
aVat the polling stations,
p108
aVof ballot boxes being stolen.
p109
aVInflated results started coming in
p110
aVand the mob was starting to get out of control.
p111
aVWe witnessed the eruption of violence in the streets.
p112
aVPeople were being beaten brutally.
p113
aVThe army started firing their guns. People were scrambling.
p114
aVIt was complete chaos.
p115
aVAnd my heart sank,
p116
aVbecause I thought, here we are again.
p117
aVHere is another proof
p118
aVthat the African is not capable of governing himself.
p119
aVAnd not only that, I am documenting it \u2014
p120
aVdocumenting my own cultural shortcomings.
p121
aa(lp122
VSo when the echo of the gunshots
p123
aVhad lingered,
p124
aVit was soon drowned by the chanting of the mob,
p125
aVand I didn't believe what I was hearing.
p126
aVThey were chanting, "We want peace.
p127
aVWe want peace."
p128
aVAnd I realized it had to come from the people.
p129
aVAfter all, they decide,
p130
aVand they did.
p131
aVSo the sounds that were before distorted and loud,
p132
aVwere suddenly a melody.
p133
aVThe sounds of the voices were harmonious.
p134
aVSo it could happen.
p135
aVA democracy could be upheld peacefully.
p136
aVIt could be, by the will of the masses
p137
aVwho were now urgently pressing
p138
aVwith all their heart and all their will
p139
aVfor peace.
p140
aa(lp141
VNow here's an interesting comparison.
p142
aVWe in the West,
p143
aVwe preach the values,
p144
aVthe golden light of democracy,
p145
aVthat we are the shining example of how it's done.
p146
aVBut when it comes down to it,
p147
aVGhana found itself in the same place
p148
aVin which the U.S. election stalled
p149
aVin the 2000 presidential elections \u2014
p150
aVBush versus Gore.
p151
aVBut instead of the unwillingness of the candidates
p152
aVto allow the system to proceed and the people to decide,
p153
aVGhana honored democracy
p154
aVand its people.
p155
aVIt didn't leave it up to the Supreme Court to decide;
p156
aVthe people did.
p157
aa(lp158
VNow the second round of voting
p159
aVdid not bring forth a clear winner either.
p160
aVI mean, it was so incredibly close.
p161
aVThe electoral commissioner declared,
p162
aVwith the consent of the parties,
p163
aVto run an unprecedented
p164
aVsecond re-run.
p165
aVSo the people went back to the polls
p166
aVto determine their own president,
p167
aVnot the legal system.
p168
aVAnd guess what, it worked.
p169
aVThe defeated candidate
p170
aVgave up power
p171
aVand made way for Ghana to move into a new democratic cycle.
p172
aVI mean, at the absolute time
p173
aVfor the absolute need of democracy,
p174
aVthey did not abuse their power.
p175
aVThe belief in true democracy and in the people runs deep,
p176
aVproving that the African is capable of governing himself.
p177
aa(lp178
VNow the uphill battle for Ghana and for Africa
p179
aVis not over,
p180
aVbut I have proof that the other side of democracy exists,
p181
aVand that we must not take it for granted.
p182
aVNow I have learned
p183
aVthat my place is not just in the West or in Africa,
p184
aVand I'm still searching
p185
aVfor my identity,
p186
aVbut I saw Ghana
p187
aVcreate democracy better.
p188
aVGhana taught me
p189
aVto look at people differently
p190
aVand to look at myself differently.
p191
aVAnd yes,
p192
aVwe Africans can.
p193
aa(lp194
VThank you.
