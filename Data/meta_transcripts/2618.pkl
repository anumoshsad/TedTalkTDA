VWhen you come to TEDx, you always think about technology,
p4
aVthe world changing, becoming more innovative.
p5
aVYou think about the driverless.
p6
aVEveryone's talking about driverless cars these days,
p7
aVand I love the concept of a driverless car,
p8
aVbut when I go in one, you know,
p9
aVI want it really slow,
p10
aVI want access to the steering wheel and the brake, just in case.
p11
aVI don't know about you, but I am not ready for a driverless bus.
p12
aVI am not ready for a driverless airplane.
p13
aa(lp14
VHow about a driverless world?
p15
aVAnd I ask you that
p16
aVbecause we are increasingly in one.
p17
aa(lp18
VIt's not supposed to be that way.
p19
aVWe're number one,
p20
aVthe United States is large and in charge.
p21
aVAmericanization and globalization for the last several generations
p22
aVhave basically been the same thing.
p23
aVRight? Whether it's the World Trade Organization
p24
aVor it's the IMF, the World Bank,
p25
aVthe Bretton Woods Accord on currency,
p26
aVthese were American institutions,
p27
aVour values, our friends, our allies, our money, our standards.
p28
aVThat was the way the world worked.
p29
aa(lp30
VSo it's sort of interesting, if you want to look at how the US looks,
p31
aVhere it is.
p32
aVThis is our view of how the world is run.
p33
aVPresident Obama has got the red carpet,
p34
aVhe goes down Air Force One,
p35
aVand it feels pretty good, it feels pretty comfortable.
p36
aVWell, I don't know how many of you saw the China trip last week
p37
aVand the G20.
p38
aVOh my God. Right?
p39
aVThis is how we landed
p40
aVfor the most important meeting of the world's leaders in China.
p41
aVThe National Security Advisor was actually spewing expletives
p42
aVon the tarmac \u2014
p43
aVno red carpet,
p44
aVkind of left out the bottom of the plane
p45
aValong with all the media and everybody else.
p46
aa(lp47
VLater on in the G20,
p48
aVwell, there's Obama.
p49
aa(lp50
V(Laughter)
p51
aa(lp52
VHi, George.
p53
aVHi, Norman.
p54
aVThey look like they're about to get into a cage match, right?
p55
aVAnd they did. It was 90 minutes long, and they talked about Syria.
p56
aVThat's what Putin wanted to talk about.
p57
aVHe's increasingly calling the shots.
p58
aVHe's the one willing to do stuff there.
p59
aVThere's not a lot of mutual like or trust,
p60
aVbut it's not as if the Americans are telling him what to do.
p61
aa(lp62
VHow about when the whole 20 are getting together?
p63
aVSurely, when the leaders are all onstage,
p64
aVthen the Americans are pulling their weight.
p65
aVUh-oh.
p66
aa(lp67
V(Laughter)
p68
aa(lp69
VXi Jinping seems fine.
p70
aVAngela Merkel has \u2014 she always does \u2014
p71
aVthat look, she always does that.
p72
aVBut Putin is telling Turkish president Erdogan what to do,
p73
aVand Obama is like, what's going on over there?
p74
aa(lp75
VYou see. And the problem is it's not a G20,
p76
aVthe problem is
p77
aVit's a G-Zero world that we live in,
p78
aVa world order where there is no single country or alliance
p79
aVthat can meet the challenges of global leadership.
p80
aVThe G20 doesn't work,
p81
aVthe G7, all of our friends, that's history.
p82
aVSo globalization is continuing.
p83
aVGoods and services and people and capital are moving across borders
p84
aVfaster and faster than ever before,
p85
aVbut Americanization is not.
p86
aa(lp87
VSo if I've convinced you of that,
p88
aVI want to do two things with the rest of this talk.
p89
aVI want to talk about the implications of that
p90
aVfor the whole world.
p91
aVI'll go around it.
p92
aVAnd then I want to talk about
p93
aVwhat we think right here
p94
aVin the United States and in New York.
p95
aa(lp96
VSo why? What are the implications. Why are we here?
p97
aVWell, we're here
p98
aVbecause the United States,
p99
aVwe spent two trillion dollars on wars in Iraq and Afghanistan
p100
aVthat were failed.
p101
aVWe don't want to do that anymore.
p102
aVWe have large numbers of middle and working classes
p103
aVthat feel like they've not benefited from promises of globalization,
p104
aVso they don't want to see it particularly.
p105
aVAnd we have an energy revolution
p106
aVwhere we don't need OPEC or the Middle East the way we used to.
p107
aVWe produce all that right here in the United States.
p108
aVSo the Americans don't want to be the global sheriff for security
p109
aVor the architect of global trade.
p110
aVThe Americans don't want to even be the cheerleader of global values.
p111
aa(lp112
VWell, then you look to Europe,
p113
aVand the most important alliance in the world
p114
aVhas been the transatlantic relationship.
p115
aVBut it is now weaker than it has been at any point since World War II,
p116
aVall of the crises, the Brexit conversations,
p117
aVthe hedging going on between the French and the Russians,
p118
aVor the Germans and the Turks, or the Brits and the Chinese.
p119
aa(lp120
VChina does want to do more leadership.
p121
aVThey do, but only in the economic sphere,
p122
aVand they want their own values, standards, currency,
p123
aVin competition with that of the US.
p124
aVThe Russians want to do more leadership.
p125
aVYou see that in Ukraine,
p126
aVin the Baltic states, in the Middle East,
p127
aVbut not with the Americans.
p128
aVThey want their own preferences and order.
p129
aVThat's why we are where we are.
p130
aa(lp131
VSo what happens going forward?
p132
aVLet's start easy,
p133
aVwith the Middle East.
p134
aa(lp135
V(Laughter)
p136
aa(lp137
VYou know, I left a little out,
p138
aVbut you get the general idea.
p139
aVLook, there are three reasons
p140
aVwhy the Middle East has had stability such as it is. Right?
p141
aVOne is because there was a willingness to provide
p142
aVsome level of military security by the US and allies.
p143
aVNumber two, it was easy to take a lot of cheap money out of the ground
p144
aVbecause oil was expensive.
p145
aVAnd number three
p146
aVwas no matter how bad the leaders were, the populations were relatively quiescent.
p147
aVThey didn't have the ability, and many didn't have the will
p148
aVto really rise up against.
p149
aa(lp150
VWell, I can tell you, in a G-Zero world,
p151
aVall three of those things are increasingly not true,
p152
aVand so failed states,
p153
aVterrorism, refugees and the rest.
p154
aVDoes the entire Middle East fall apart?
p155
aVNo, the Kurds will do better, and Iraq, Israel, Iran over time.
p156
aVBut generally speaking, it's not a good look.
p157
aa(lp158
VOK, how about this guy?
p159
aVHe's playing a poor hand very well.
p160
aVThere's no question he's hitting above his weight.
p161
aVBut long term \u2014 I didn't mean that.
p162
aVBut long term, long term,
p163
aVif you think that the Russians
p164
aVwere antagonized by the US and Europe expanding NATO right up to their borders
p165
aVwhen we said they weren't going to,
p166
aVand the EU encroaching them,
p167
aVjust wait until the Chinese put hundreds of billions of dollars
p168
aVin every country around Russia they thought they had influence in.
p169
aVThe Chinese are going to dominate it. The Russians are picking up the crumbs.
p170
aVIn a G-Zero world, this is going to be a very tense 10 years for Mr. Putin.
p171
aa(lp172
VIt's not all bad. Right?
p173
aVAsia actually looks a lot better.
p174
aVThere are real leaders across Asia,
p175
aVthey have a lot of political stability.
p176
aVThey're there for a while.
p177
aVMr. Modi in India,
p178
aVMr. Abe, who is probably about to get a third term written in
p179
aVin the Liberal Democratic Party in Japan,
p180
aVof course Xi Jinping who is consolidating enormous power,
p181
aVthe most powerful leader in China
p182
aVsince Mao.
p183
aVThose are the three most important economies in Asia.
p184
aVNow look, there are problems in Asia.
p185
aVWe see the sparring over the South China Sea.
p186
aVWe see that Kim Jong Un, just in the last couple of days,
p187
aVtested yet another nuclear weapon.
p188
aVBut the leaders in Asia do not feel the need
p189
aVto wave the flag,
p190
aVto go xenophobic,
p191
aVto actually allow escalation
p192
aVof the geopolitical and cross-border tensions.
p193
aVThey want to focus on long-term economic stability and growth.
p194
aVAnd that's what they're actually doing.
p195
aa(lp196
VLet's turn to Europe.
p197
aVEurope does look a little scared in this environment.
p198
aVSo much of what is happening in the Middle East
p199
aVis washing up quite literally onto European shores.
p200
aVYou see Brexit and you see the concerns of populism
p201
aVacross all of the European states.
p202
aa(lp203
VLet me tell you that over the long term,
p204
aVin a G-Zero world,
p205
aVEuropean expansion will be seen to have gone too far.
p206
aVEurope went right up to Russia, went right down to the Middle East,
p207
aVand if the world were truly becoming more flat and more Americanized,
p208
aVthat would be less of a problem,
p209
aVbut in a G-Zero world, those countries nearest Russia
p210
aVand nearest the Middle East
p211
aVactually have different economic capabilities,
p212
aVdifferent social stability
p213
aVand different political preferences and systems than core Europe.
p214
aVSo Europe was able to truly expand
p215
aVunder the G7,
p216
aVbut under the G-Zero, Europe will get smaller.
p217
aVCore Europe around Germany and France and others
p218
aVwill still work, be functional, stable, wealthy, integrated.
p219
aVBut the periphery,
p220
aVcountries like Greece and Turkey and others,
p221
aVwill not look that good at all.
p222
aa(lp223
VLatin America, a lot of populism,
p224
aVmade the economies not go so well.
p225
aVThey had been more opposed to the United States for decades.
p226
aVIncreasingly, they're coming back.
p227
aVWe see that in Argentina.
p228
aVWe see it with the openness in Cuba.
p229
aVWe will see it in Venezuela when Maduro falls.
p230
aVWe will see it in Brazil after the impeachment
p231
aVand when we finally see a new legitimate president elected there.
p232
aVThe only place you see that is moving in another direction
p233
aVis the unpopularity of Mexican president Peña Nieto.
p234
aVThere you could actually see a slip away from the United States
p235
aVover the coming years.
p236
aVThe US election matters a lot on that one, too.
p237
aa(lp238
V(Laughter)
p239
aa(lp240
VAfrica, right?
p241
aVA lot of people have said it's going to be Africa's decade, finally.
p242
aVIn a G-Zero world, it is absolutely an amazing time
p243
aVfor a few African countries,
p244
aVthose governed well with a lot of urbanization,
p245
aVa lot of smart people, women really getting into the workforce,
p246
aVentrepreneurship taking off.
p247
aVBut for most of the countries in Africa,
p248
aVit's going to be a lot more dicey:
p249
aVextreme climate conditions,
p250
aVradicalism both from Islam and also Christianity,
p251
aVvery poor governance,
p252
aVborders you can't defend, lots of forced migration.
p253
aVThose countries can fall off the map.
p254
aVSo you're really going to see an extreme segregation going on
p255
aVbetween the winners and the losers across Africa.
p256
aa(lp257
VFinally, back to the United States.
p258
aVWhat do I think about us?
p259
aVBecause there are a lot of upset people,
p260
aVnot here at TEDx, I know,
p261
aVbut in the United States, my God,
p262
aVafter 15 months of campaigning, we should be upset.
p263
aVI understand that.
p264
aVBut a lot of people are upset because they say, "Washington's broken,
p265
aVwe don't trust the establishment, we hate the media."
p266
aVHeck, even globalists like me are taking it on the chin.
p267
aa(lp268
VLook, I do think we have to recognize,
p269
aVmy fellow campers,
p270
aVthat when you are being chased by the bear,
p271
aVin the global context, you need not outrun the bear,
p272
aVyou need to only outrun your fellow campers.
p273
aa(lp274
V(Laughter)
p275
aa(lp276
VNow, I just told you
p277
aVabout our fellow campers.
p278
aVRight? And from that perspective,
p279
aVwe look OK.
p280
aVA lot of people in that context say,
p281
aV"Let's go dollar. Let's go New York real estate.
p282
aVLet's send our kids to American universities."
p283
aVYou know, our neighbors are awesome:
p284
aVCanada, Mexico and two big bodies of water.
p285
aVYou know how much Turkey would love to have neighbors like that?
p286
aVThose are awesome neighbors.
p287
aa(lp288
VTerrorism is a problem in the United States.
p289
aVGod knows we know it here in New York.
p290
aVBut it's a much bigger problem in Europe than the US.
p291
aVIt's a much bigger problem in the Middle East
p292
aVthan it is in Europe.
p293
aVThese are factors of large magnitude.
p294
aVWe just accepted 10,000 Syrian refugees, and we're complaining bitterly about it.
p295
aVYou know why? Because they can't swim here.
p296
aVRight? I mean, the Turks would love to have only 10,000 Syrian refugees.
p297
aVThe Jordanians, the Germans, the Brits. Right?
p298
aVThat's not the situation.
p299
aVThat's the reality of the United States.
p300
aa(lp301
VNow, that sounds pretty good.
p302
aVHere's the challenge.
p303
aVIn a G-Zero world, the way you lead
p304
aVis by example.
p305
aVIf we know we don't want to be the global cop anymore,
p306
aVif we know we're not going to be the architect of global trade,
p307
aVwe're not going to be the cheerleader of global values,
p308
aVwe're not going to do it the way we used to,
p309
aVthe 21st century is changing,
p310
aVwe need to lead by example \u2014 be so compelling
p311
aVthat all these other people are going to still say,
p312
aVit's not just they're faster campers.
p313
aVEven when the bear is not chasing us, this is a good place to be.
p314
aVWe want to emulate them.
p315
aa(lp316
VThe election process this year is not proving a good option
p317
aVfor leading by example.
p318
aVHillary Clinton says it's going to be like the '90s.
p319
aVWe can still be that cheerleader on values.
p320
aVWe can still be the architect of global trade.
p321
aVWe can still be the global sheriff.
p322
aVAnd Donald Trump wants to bring us back to the '30s.
p323
aVHe's saying, "Our way or the highway. You don't like it, lump it." Right?
p324
aVNeither are recognizing a fundamental truth of the G-Zero,
p325
aVwhich is that even though the US is not in decline,
p326
aVit is getting objectively harder
p327
aVfor the Americans to impose their will,
p328
aVeven have great influence,
p329
aVon the global order.
p330
aa(lp331
VAre we prepared to truly lead by example?
p332
aVWhat would we have to do to fix this
p333
aVafter November,
p334
aVafter the next president comes in?
p335
aVWell, either we have to have another crisis that forces us to respond.
p336
aVA depression would do that.
p337
aVAnother global financial crisis could do this.
p338
aVGod forbid, another 9/11 could do that.
p339
aVOr, absent crisis,
p340
aVwe need to see that the hollowing out, the inequality, the challenges
p341
aVthat are growing and growing in the United States,
p342
aVare themselves urgent enough
p343
aVto force our leaders to change,
p344
aVand that we have those voices.
p345
aVThrough our cell phones, individually,
p346
aVwe have those voices to compel them to change.
p347
aa(lp348
VThere is, of course, a third choice,
p349
aVperhaps the most likely one,
p350
aVwhich is that we do neither of those things,
p351
aVand in four years time you invite me back,
p352
aVand I will give this speech yet again.
p353
aa(lp354
VThank you very, very much.
