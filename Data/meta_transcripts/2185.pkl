VOne of the first patients I had to see as a pediatrician was Sol,
p4
aVa beautiful month-old baby
p5
aVwho was admitted with signs of a severe respiratory infection.
p6
aVUntil then, I had never seen a patient worsen so fast.
p7
aVIn just two days she was connected to a respirator
p8
aVand on the third day she died.
p9
aVSol had whooping cough.
p10
aVAfter discussing the case in the room and after a quite distressing catharsis,
p11
aVI remember my chief resident said to me,
p12
aV"Okay, take a deep breath. Wash your face.
p13
aVAnd now comes the hardest part:
p14
aVWe have to go talk to her parents."
p15
aVAt that time, a thousand questions came to mind,
p16
aVfrom, "How could a one-month-old baby be so unfortunate?"
p17
aVto, "Could we have done something about it?"
p18
aa(lp19
VBefore vaccines existed,
p20
aVmany infectious diseases killed millions of people per year.
p21
aVDuring the 1918 flu pandemic
p22
aV50 million people died.
p23
aVThat's greater than Argentina's current population.
p24
aVPerhaps, the older ones among you remember the polio epidemic
p25
aVthat occurred in Argentina in 1956.
p26
aVAt that time, there was no vaccine available against polio.
p27
aVPeople didn't know what to do. They were going crazy.
p28
aVThey would go painting trees with caustic lime.
p29
aVThey'd put little bags of camphor
p30
aVin their children's underwear, as if that could do something.
p31
aVDuring the polio epidemic, thousands of people died.
p32
aVAnd thousands of people were left with very significant neurological damage.
p33
aVI know this because I read about it,
p34
aVbecause thanks to vaccines, my generation was lucky
p35
aVto not live through an epidemic as terrible as this.
p36
aa(lp37
VVaccines are one of the great successes of the 20th century's public health.
p38
aVAfter potable water,
p39
aVthey are the interventions that have most reduced mortality,
p40
aVeven more than antibiotics.
p41
aVVaccines eradicated terrible diseases such as smallpox from the planet
p42
aVand succeeded in significantly reducing mortality
p43
aVdue to other diseases such as measles,
p44
aVwhooping cough, polio and many more.
p45
aa(lp46
VAll these diseases are considered vaccine-preventable diseases.
p47
aVWhat does this mean?
p48
aVThat they are potentially preventable,
p49
aVbut in order to be so, something must be done.
p50
aVYou need to get vaccinated.
p51
aVI imagine that most, if not all of us here today,
p52
aVreceived a vaccine at some point in our life.
p53
aVNow, I'm not so sure that many of us know
p54
aVwhich vaccines or boosters we should receive after adolescence.
p55
aVHave you ever wondered who we are protecting
p56
aVwhen we vaccinate?
p57
aVWhat do I mean by that?
p58
aVIs there any other effect beyond protecting ourselves?
p59
aa(lp60
VLet me show you something.
p61
aVImagine for a moment
p62
aVthat we are in a city
p63
aVthat has never had a case of a particular disease,
p64
aVsuch as the measles.
p65
aVThis would mean that no one in the city has ever had contact with the disease.
p66
aVNo one has natural defenses against, nor been vaccinated against measles.
p67
aVIf one day, a person sick with the measles appears in this city
p68
aVthe disease won't find much resistance
p69
aVand will begin spreading from person to person,
p70
aVand in no time it will disseminate throughout the community.
p71
aVAfter a certain time
p72
aVa big part of the population will be ill.
p73
aVThis happened when there were no vaccines.
p74
aa(lp75
VNow, imagine the complete opposite case.
p76
aVWe are in a city
p77
aVwhere more than 90 percent of the population
p78
aVhas defenses against the measles, which means
p79
aVthat they either had the disease, survived, and developed natural defenses;
p80
aVor that they had been immunized against measles.
p81
aVIf one day,
p82
aVa person sick with the measles appears in this city,
p83
aVthe disease will find much more resistance
p84
aVand won't be transmitted that much from person to person.
p85
aVThe spread will probably remain contained
p86
aVand a measles outbreak won't happen.
p87
aa(lp88
VI would like you to pay attention to something.
p89
aVPeople who are vaccinated
p90
aVare not only protecting themselves,
p91
aVbut by blocking the dissemination of the disease
p92
aVwithin the community,
p93
aVthey are indirectly protecting the people in this community
p94
aVwho are not vaccinated.
p95
aVThey create a kind of protective shield
p96
aVwhich prevents them from coming in contact with the disease,
p97
aVso that these people are protected.
p98
aVThis indirect protection
p99
aVthat the unvaccinated people within a community receive
p100
aVsimply by being surrounded by vaccinated people,
p101
aVis called herd immunity.
p102
aa(lp103
VMany people in the community
p104
aVdepend almost exclusively on this herd immunity
p105
aVto be protected against disease.
p106
aVThe unvaccinated people you see in infographics are not just hypothetical.
p107
aVThose people are our nieces and nephews, our children,
p108
aVwho may be too young to receive their first shots.
p109
aVThey are our parents, our siblings,
p110
aVour acquaintances,
p111
aVwho may have a disease,
p112
aVor take medication that lowers their defenses.
p113
aVThere are also people who are allergic to a particular vaccine.
p114
aVThey could even be among us,
p115
aVany of us who got vaccinated,
p116
aVbut the vaccine didn't produce the expected effect,
p117
aVbecause not all vaccines are always 100 percent effective.
p118
aVAll these people depend almost exclusively on herd immunity
p119
aVto be protected against diseases.
p120
aa(lp121
VTo achieve this effect of herd immunity,
p122
aVit is necessary that a large percentage of the population be vaccinated.
p123
aVThis percentage is called the threshold.
p124
aVThe threshold depends on many variables:
p125
aVIt depends on the germ's characteristics,
p126
aVand those of the immune response that the vaccine generates.
p127
aVBut they all have something in common.
p128
aVIf the percentage of the population in a vaccinated community
p129
aVis below this threshold number,
p130
aVthe disease will begin to spread more freely
p131
aVand may generate an outbreak of this disease within the community.
p132
aVEven diseases which were  at some point controlled may reappear.
p133
aa(lp134
VThis is not just a theory.
p135
aVThis has happened, and is still happening.
p136
aVIn 1998, a British researcher published an article
p137
aVin one of the most important medical journals,
p138
aVsaying that the MMR vaccine,
p139
aVwhich is given for measles, mumps and rubella,
p140
aVwas associated with autism.
p141
aVThis generated an immediate impact.
p142
aVPeople began to stop getting vaccinated, and stopped vaccinating their children.
p143
aVAnd what happened?
p144
aVThe number of people vaccinated,
p145
aVin many communities around the world, fell below this threshold.
p146
aVAnd there were outbreaks of measles in many cities in the world \u2014
p147
aVin the U.S., in Europe.
p148
aVMany people got sick.
p149
aVPeople died of measles.
p150
aVWhat happened?
p151
aa(lp152
VThis article also generated a huge stir within the medical community.
p153
aVDozens of researchers began to assess if this was actually true.
p154
aVNot only could no one find
p155
aVa causal association between MMR and autism at the population level,
p156
aVbut it was also found that this article had incorrect claims.
p157
aVEven more, it was fraudulent.
p158
aVIt was fraudulent.
p159
aVIn fact, the journal publicly retracted the article in 2010.
p160
aVOne of the main concerns and excuses for not getting vaccinated
p161
aVare the adverse effects.
p162
aa(lp163
VVaccines, like other drugs, can have potential adverse effects.
p164
aVMost are mild and temporary.
p165
aVBut the benefits are always greater than possible complications.
p166
aVWhen we are ill, we want to heal fast.
p167
aVMany of us who are here
p168
aVtake antibiotics when we have an infection,
p169
aVwe take anti-hypertensives when we have high blood pressure,
p170
aVwe take cardiac medications.
p171
aVWhy? Because we are sick and we want to heal fast.
p172
aVAnd we don't question it much.
p173
aVWhy is it so difficult to think of preventing diseases,
p174
aVby taking care of ourselves when we are healthy?
p175
aVWe take care of ourselves a lot when affected by an illness,
p176
aVor in situations of imminent danger.
p177
aa(lp178
VI imagine most of us here,
p179
aVremember the influenza-A pandemic
p180
aVwhich broke out in 2009 in Argentina and worldwide.
p181
aVWhen the first cases began to come to light,
p182
aVwe, here in Argentina, were entering the winter season.
p183
aVWe knew absolutely nothing.
p184
aVEverything was a mess.
p185
aVPeople wore masks on the street, ran into pharmacies to buy alcohol gel.
p186
aVPeople would line up in pharmacies to get a vaccine,
p187
aVwithout even knowing if it was the right vaccine
p188
aVthat would protect them against this new virus.
p189
aVWe knew absolutely nothing.
p190
aVAt that time, in addition to doing my fellowship at the Infant Foundation,
p191
aVI worked as a home pediatrician for a prepaid medicine company.
p192
aVI remember that I started my shift at 8 a.m.,
p193
aVand by 8, I already had a list of 50 scheduled visits.
p194
aVIt was chaos; people didn't know what to do.
p195
aVI remember the types of patients that I was examining.
p196
aVThe patients were a little older than what we were used to seeing in winter,
p197
aVwith longer fevers.
p198
aa(lp199
VAnd I mentioned that to my fellowship mentor,
p200
aVand he, for his part, had heard the same from a colleague,
p201
aVabout the large number of pregnant women
p202
aVand young adults
p203
aVbeing hospitalized in intensive care,
p204
aVwith hard-to-manage clinical profiles.
p205
aVAt that time, we set out to understand what was happening.
p206
aVFirst thing Monday morning, we took the car
p207
aVand went to a hospital in Buenos Aires Province,
p208
aVthat served as a referral hospital for cases of the new influenza virus.
p209
aVWe arrived at the hospital; it was crowded.
p210
aVAll health staff were dressed in NASA-like bio-safety suits.
p211
aVWe all had face masks in our pockets.
p212
aVI, being a hypochondriac, didn't breathe for two hours.
p213
aVBut we could see what was happening.
p214
aVImmediately, we started reaching out to pediatricians
p215
aVfrom six hospitals in the city and in Buenos Aires Province.
p216
aVOur main goal was to find out
p217
aVhow this new virus behaved in contact with our children,
p218
aVin the shortest time possible.
p219
aVA marathon work.
p220
aVIn less than three months,
p221
aVwe could see what effect this new H1N1 virus had
p222
aVon the 251 children hospitalized by this virus.
p223
aVWe could see which children got more seriously ill:
p224
aVchildren under four, especially those less than one year old;
p225
aVpatients with neurological diseases;
p226
aVand young children with chronic pulmonary diseases.
p227
aVIdentifying these at-risk groups was important
p228
aVto include them as priority groups
p229
aVin the recommendations for getting the influenza vaccine,
p230
aVnot only here in Argentina,
p231
aVbut also in other countries which the pandemic not yet reached.
p232
aa(lp233
VA year later,
p234
aVwhen a vaccine against the pandemic H1N1 virus became available,
p235
aVwe wanted to see what happened.
p236
aVAfter a huge vaccination campaign
p237
aVaimed at protecting at-risk groups,
p238
aVthese hospitals, with 93 percent of the at-risk groups vaccinated,
p239
aVhad not hospitalized a single patient
p240
aVfor the pandemic H1N1 virus.
p241
aV(Applause)
p242
aVIn 2009: 251.
p243
aVIn 2010: zero.
p244
aa(lp245
VVaccination is an act of individual responsibility,
p246
aVbut it has a huge collective impact.
p247
aVIf I get vaccinated, not only am I protecting myself,
p248
aVbut I am also protecting others.
p249
aVSol had whooping cough.
p250
aVSol was very young,
p251
aVand she hadn't yet received her first vaccine against whooping cough.
p252
aVI still wonder what would have happened
p253
aVif everyone around Sol had been vaccinated.
