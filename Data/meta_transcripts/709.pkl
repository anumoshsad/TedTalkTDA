VGood morning.
p4
aVI've come here to share with you an experiment
p5
aVof how to get rid of one form of human suffering.
p6
aVIt really is a story of Dr. Venkataswamy.
p7
aVHis mission and his message is about the Aravind Eye Care System.
p8
aVI think first it's important for us to recognize what it is to be blind.
p9
aa(lp10
V(Music)
p11
aa(lp12
VWoman: Everywhere I went looking for work, they said no,
p13
aVwhat use do we have for a blind woman?
p14
aVI couldn't thread a needle or see the lice in my hair.
p15
aVIf an ant fell into my rice, I couldn't see that either.
p16
aa(lp17
VThulasiraj Ravilla: Becoming blind is a big part of it,
p18
aVbut I think it also deprives the person of their livelihood, their dignity,
p19
aVtheir independence, and their status in the family.
p20
aVSo she is just one amongst the millions who are blind.
p21
aVAnd the irony is that they don't need to be.
p22
aa(lp23
VA simple, well-proven surgery can restore sight to millions,
p24
aVand something even simpler, a pair of glasses, can make millions more see.
p25
aVIf we add to that the many of us here now
p26
aVwho are more productive because they have a pair of glasses,
p27
aVthen almost one in five Indians will require eye care,
p28
aVa staggering 200 million people.
p29
aVToday, we're reaching not even 10 percent of them.
p30
aa(lp31
VSo this is the context in which Aravind came into existence
p32
aVabout 30 years back
p33
aVas a post-retirement project of Dr. V.
p34
aVHe started this with no money.
p35
aVHe had to mortgage all his life savings
p36
aVto make a bank loan.
p37
aVAnd over time, we have grown into a network of five hospitals,
p38
aVpredominately in the state of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry,
p39
aVand then we added several, what we call Vision Centers
p40
aVas a hub-and-spoke model.
p41
aVAnd then more recently we started managing hospitals
p42
aVin other parts of the country
p43
aVand also setting up hospitals in other parts of the world as well.
p44
aa(lp45
VThe last three decades,
p46
aVwe have done about three-and-a-half million surgeries,
p47
aVa vast majority of them for the poor people.
p48
aVNow, each year we perform about 300,000 surgeries.
p49
aVA typical day at Aravind, we would do about a thousand surgeries,
p50
aVmaybe see about 6,000 patients,
p51
aVsend out teams into the villages to examine, bring back patients,
p52
aVlots of telemedicine consultations,
p53
aVand, on top of that, do a lot of training,
p54
aVboth for doctors and technicians who will become the future staff of Aravind.
p55
aa(lp56
VAnd then doing this day-in and day-out, and doing it well,
p57
aVrequires a lot of inspiration and a lot of hard work.
p58
aVAnd I think this was possible thanks to the building blocks
p59
aVput in place by Dr. V.,
p60
aVa value system, an efficient delivery process,
p61
aVand fostering the culture of innovation.
p62
aa(lp63
V(Music)
p64
aa(lp65
VDr. V: I used to sit with the ordinary village man because I am from a village,
p66
aVand suddenly you turn around and seem to be in contact with his inner being,
p67
aVyou seem to be one with him.
p68
aVHere is a soul which has got all the simplicity of confidence.
p69
aVDoctor, whatever you say, I accept it.
p70
aVAn implicit faith in you
p71
aVand then you respond to it.
p72
aVHere is an old lady who has got so much faith in me, I must do my best for her.
p73
aVWhen we grow in spiritual consciousness,
p74
aVwe identify ourselves with all that is in the world,
p75
aVso there is no exploitation.
p76
aVIt is ourselves we are helping.
p77
aVIt is ourselves we are healing.
p78
aa(lp79
V(Applause)
p80
aa(lp81
VThis helped us build a very ethical and very highly patient-centric organization
p82
aVand systems that support it.
p83
aVBut on a practical level, you also have to deliver services efficiently,
p84
aVand, odd as it may seem, the inspiration came from McDonald's.
p85
aa(lp86
VDr. V: See, McDonald's' concept is simple.
p87
aVThey feel they can train people all over the world,
p88
aVirrespective of different religions, cultures, all those things,
p89
aVto produce a product in the same way
p90
aVand deliver it in the same manner
p91
aVin hundreds of places.
p92
aa(lp93
VLarry Brilliant: He kept talking about McDonalds and hamburgers,
p94
aVand none of it made any sense to us.
p95
aVHe wanted to create a franchise,
p96
aVa mechanism of delivery of eye care
p97
aVwith the efficiency of McDonald's.
p98
aa(lp99
VDr. V: Supposing I'm able to produce eye care,
p100
aVtechniques, methods, all in the same way,
p101
aVand make it available in every corner of the world.
p102
aVThe problem of blindness is gone.
p103
aa(lp104
VTR: If you think about it, I think the eyeball is the same,
p105
aVas American or African,
p106
aVthe problem is the same, the treatment is the same.
p107
aVAnd yet, why should there be so much variation in quality and in service,
p108
aVand that was the fundamental principle that we followed
p109
aVwhen we designed the delivery systems.
p110
aVAnd, of course, the challenge was that it's a huge problem,
p111
aVwe are talking of millions of people,
p112
aVvery little resource to deal with it,
p113
aVand then lots of logistics and affordability issues.
p114
aa(lp115
VAnd then so, one had to constantly innovate.
p116
aVAnd one of the early innovations, which still continues,
p117
aVis to create ownership in the community to the problem,
p118
aVand then engage with them as a partner,
p119
aVand here is one such event.
p120
aVHere a community camp just organized
p121
aVby the community themselves,
p122
aVwhere they find a place, organize volunteers,
p123
aVand then we'll do our part. You know, check their vision,
p124
aVand then you have doctors who you find out what the problem is
p125
aVand then determine what further testing should be done,
p126
aVand then those tests are done by technicians
p127
aVwho check for glasses,
p128
aVor check for glaucoma.
p129
aa(lp130
VAnd then, with all these results, the doctor makes a final diagnosis,
p131
aVand then prescribes a line of treatment,
p132
aVand if they need a pair of glasses, they are available right there at the camp site,
p133
aVusually under a tree.
p134
aVBut they get glasses in the frames of their choice,
p135
aVand that's very important because I think glasses,
p136
aVin addition to helping people see,
p137
aVis also a fashion statement, and they're willing to pay for it.
p138
aVSo they get it in about 20 minutes
p139
aVand those who require surgery, are counseled,
p140
aVand then there are buses waiting,
p141
aVwhich will transport them to the base hospital.
p142
aa(lp143
VAnd if it was not for this kind of logistics and support,
p144
aVmany people like this would probably never get services,
p145
aVand certainly not when they most need it.
p146
aVThey receive surgery the following day,
p147
aVand then they will stay for a day or two,
p148
aVand then they are put back on the buses
p149
aVto be taken back to where they came from,
p150
aVand where their families will be waiting to take them back home.
p151
aa(lp152
V(Applause)
p153
aa(lp154
VAnd this happens several thousand times each year.
p155
aVIt may sound impressive that we're seeing lots of patients,
p156
aVvery efficient process,
p157
aVbut we looked at, are we solving the problem?
p158
aVWe did a study, a scientifically designed process,
p159
aVand then, to our dismay,
p160
aVwe found this was only reaching seven percent of those in need,
p161
aVand we're not adequately addressing more, bigger problems.
p162
aa(lp163
VSo we had to do something different,
p164
aVso we set up what we call primary eye care centers, vision centers.
p165
aVThese are truly paperless offices
p166
aVwith completely electronic medical records and so on.
p167
aVThey receive comprehensive eye exams.
p168
aVWe kind of changed the simple digital camera into a retinal camera,
p169
aVand then every patient gets their teleconsultation with a doctor.
p170
aa(lp171
VThe effect of this has been that, within the first year,
p172
aVwe really had a 40 percent penetration in the market that it served,
p173
aVwhich is over 50,000 people.
p174
aVAnd the second year went up to 75 percent.
p175
aVSo I think we have a process by which
p176
aVwe can really penetrate into the market
p177
aVand reach everyone who needs it,
p178
aVand in this process of using technology, make sure
p179
aVthat most don't need to come to the base hospital.
p180
aa(lp181
VAnd how much will they pay for this?
p182
aVWe fixed the pricing, taking into account
p183
aVwhat they would save in bus fare in coming to a city,
p184
aVso they pay about 20 rupees, and that's good for three consultations.
p185
aa(lp186
V(Applause)
p187
aa(lp188
VThe other challenge was, how do you give high-tech
p189
aVor more advanced treatment and care?
p190
aVWe designed a van with a VSAT,
p191
aVwhich sends out images of patients to the base hospital
p192
aVwhere it is diagnosed,
p193
aVand then as the patient is waiting, the report goes back to the patient,
p194
aVit gets printed out, the patient gets it,
p195
aVand then gets a consultation about what they should be doing \u2014
p196
aVI mean, go see a doctor or come back after six months,
p197
aVand then this happens as a way of
p198
aVbridging the technology competence.
p199
aa(lp200
VSo the impact of all this has been essentially one of growing the market,
p201
aVbecause it focused on the non-customer,
p202
aVand then by reaching the unreached,
p203
aVwe're able to significantly grow the market.
p204
aa(lp205
VThe other aspect is how do you deal with this efficiently
p206
aVwhen you have very few ophthalmologists?
p207
aVSo what is in this video is a surgeon operating,
p208
aVand then you see on the other side,
p209
aVanother patient is getting ready.
p210
aVSo, as they finish the surgery,
p211
aVthey just swing the microscope over,
p212
aVthe tables are placed so that their distance is just right,
p213
aVand then we need to do this, because, by doing this kind of process,
p214
aVwe're able to more than quadruple the productivity of the surgeon.
p215
aa(lp216
VAnd then to support the surgeon,
p217
aVwe require a certain workforce.
p218
aVAnd then we focused on village girls that we recruited,
p219
aVand then they really are the backbone of the organization.
p220
aVThey do almost all of the skill-based routine tasks.
p221
aVThey do one thing at a time. They do it extremely well.
p222
aVWith the result we have very high productivity,
p223
aVvery high quality at very, very low cost.
p224
aVSo, putting all this together, what really happened was
p225
aVthe productivity of our staff was
p226
aVsignificantly higher than anyone else.
p227
aa(lp228
V(Applause)
p229
aa(lp230
VThis is a very busy table,
p231
aVbut what this really is conveying is that,
p232
aVwhen it comes to quality, we have put in
p233
aVvery good quality-assurance systems.
p234
aVAs a result, our complications are significantly lower
p235
aVthan what has been reported in the United Kingdom,
p236
aVand you don't see those kind of numbers very often.
p237
aa(lp238
V(Applause)
p239
aa(lp240
VSo the final part of the puzzle is,
p241
aVhow do you make all this work financially,
p242
aVespecially when the people can't pay for it?
p243
aVSo what we did was, we gave away a lot of it for free,
p244
aVand then those who pay, I mean, they paid local market rates,
p245
aVnothing more, and often much less.
p246
aVAnd we were helped by the market inefficiency.
p247
aVI think that has been a big savior, even now.
p248
aVAnd, of course, one needs the mindset to be wanting to give away
p249
aVwhat you have as a surplus.
p250
aa(lp251
VThe result has been, over the years,
p252
aVthe expenditure has increased with volumes.
p253
aVThe revenues increase at a higher level,
p254
aVgiving us a healthy margin
p255
aVwhile you're treating a large number of people for free.
p256
aVI think in absolute terms,
p257
aVlast year we earned about 20-odd million dollars,
p258
aVspent about 13 million, with over a 40 percent EBITA.
p259
aa(lp260
V(Applause)
p261
aa(lp262
VBut this really requires going beyond what we do,
p263
aVor what we have done,
p264
aVif you really want to achieve solving this problem of blindness.
p265
aVAnd what we did was a couple of very counter-intuitive things.
p266
aVWe created competition for ourselves,
p267
aVand then we made eye care affordable
p268
aVby making low-cost consumables.
p269
aVWe proactively and systematically
p270
aVpromoted these practices to many hospitals in India,
p271
aVmany in our own backyards and then in other parts of the world as well.
p272
aVThe impact of this has been that these hospitals,
p273
aVin the second year after our consultation,
p274
aVare double their output
p275
aVand then achieve financial recovery as well.
p276
aa(lp277
VThe other part was how do you address
p278
aVthis increase in cost of technology?
p279
aVThere was a time when we failed to negotiate
p280
aVthe [intra-ocular lens] prices to be at affordable levels,
p281
aVso we set up a manufacturing unit.
p282
aVAnd then, over time, we were able to bring down the cost significantly
p283
aVto about two percent of what it used to be when we started out.
p284
aVToday, we believe we have about seven percent of the global market,
p285
aVand they're used in about 120-odd countries.
p286
aa(lp287
VTo conclude, I mean, what we do, does it have a broader relevance,
p288
aVor is it just India or developing countries?
p289
aVSo to address this, we studied UK versus Aravind.
p290
aVWhat it shows is that we do roughly about 60 percent
p291
aVof the volume of what the UK does,
p292
aVnear a half-million surgeries as a whole country.
p293
aVAnd we do about 300,000.
p294
aVAnd then we train about 50 ophthalmologists
p295
aVagainst the 70 trained by them,
p296
aVcomparable quality, both in training and in patient care.
p297
aVSo we're really comparing apples to apples.
p298
aVWe looked at cost.
p299
aV(Laughter)
p300
aa(lp301
V(Applause)
p302
aa(lp303
VSo, I think it is simple to say
p304
aVjust because the U.K. isn't India the difference is happening.
p305
aVI think there is more to it.
p306
aVI mean, I think one has to look at other aspects as well.
p307
aVMaybe there is \u2014
p308
aVthe solution to the cost could be in productivity,
p309
aVmaybe in efficiency, in the clinical process,
p310
aVor in how much they pay for the lenses or consumables,
p311
aVor regulations, their defensive practice.
p312
aVSo, I think decoding this can probably bring
p313
aVanswers to most developed countries
p314
aVincluding the U.S., and maybe
p315
aVObama's ratings can go up again.
p316
aa(lp317
V(Laughter)
p318
aa(lp319
VAnother insight, which, again, I want to leave with you,
p320
aVin conditions where the problem is very large,
p321
aVwhich cuts across all economic strata,
p322
aVwhere we have a good solution,
p323
aVI think the process I described,
p324
aVyou know, productivity, quality, patient-centered care,
p325
aVcan give an answer,
p326
aVand there are many which fit this paradigm.
p327
aVYou take dentistry, hearing aid, maternity and so on.
p328
aVThere are many where this paradigm can now play,
p329
aVbut I think probably one of the most challenging things
p330
aVis on the softer side.
p331
aa(lp332
VNow, how do you create compassion?
p333
aVNow, how do you make people own the problem,
p334
aVwant to do something about it?
p335
aVThere are a bit harder issues.
p336
aVAnd I'm sure people in this crowd can probably find the solutions to these.
p337
aa(lp338
VSo I want to end my talk leaving this thought and challenge to you.
p339
aa(lp340
VDr. V: When you grow in spiritual consciousness,
p341
aVwe identify with all that is in the world
p342
aVso there is no exploitation.
p343
aVIt is ourselves we are helping.
p344
aVIt is ourselves we are healing.
p345
aa(lp346
