VHello, my name is Thomas Heatherwick.
p4
aVI have a studio in London
p5
aVthat has a particular approach
p6
aVto designing buildings.
p7
aVWhen I was growing up,
p8
aVI was exposed to making
p9
aVand crafts and materials
p10
aVand invention on a small scale.
p11
aVAnd I was there looking
p12
aVat the larger scale of buildings
p13
aVand finding
p14
aVthat the buildings that were around me
p15
aVand that were being designed
p16
aVand that were there in the publications I was seeing
p17
aVfelt soulless and cold.
p18
aVAnd there on the smaller scale,
p19
aVthe scale of an earring
p20
aVor a ceramic pot
p21
aVor a musical instrument,
p22
aVwas a materiality and a soulfulness.
p23
aVAnd this influenced me.
p24
aVThe first building I built was 20 years ago.
p25
aVAnd since, in the last 20 years,
p26
aVI've developed a studio in London.
p27
aVSorry, this was my mother, by the way,
p28
aVin her bead shop in London.
p29
aVI spent a lot of time counting beads and things like that.
p30
aa(lp31
VI'm just going to show, for people who don't know my studio's work,
p32
aVa few projects that we've worked on.
p33
aVThis is a hospital building.
p34
aVThis is a shop for a bag company.
p35
aVThis is studios for artists.
p36
aVThis is a sculpture
p37
aVmade from a million yards of wire
p38
aVand 150,000 glass beads
p39
aVthe size of a golf ball.
p40
aVAnd this is a window display.
p41
aVAnd this is pair of cooling towers
p42
aVfor an electricity substation
p43
aVnext to St. Paul's Cathedral in London.
p44
aVAnd this is a temple in Japan
p45
aVfor a Buddhist monk.
p46
aVAnd this is a cafe by the sea
p47
aVin Britain.
p48
aa(lp49
VAnd just very quickly,
p50
aVsomething we've been working on very recently
p51
aVis we were commissioned by the mayor of London
p52
aVto design a new bus
p53
aVthat gave the passenger
p54
aVtheir freedom again.
p55
aVBecause the original Routemaster bus
p56
aVthat some of you may be familiar with,
p57
aVwhich had this open platform at the back \u2014
p58
aVin fact, I think all our Routemasters
p59
aVare here in California now actually.
p60
aVBut they aren't in London.
p61
aVAnd so you're stuck on a bus.
p62
aVAnd if the bus is going to stop
p63
aVand it's three yards away from the bus stop,
p64
aVyou're just a prisoner.
p65
aVBut the mayor of London wanted to reintroduce
p66
aVbuses with this open platform.
p67
aVSo we've been working with Transport for London,
p68
aVand that organization
p69
aVhasn't actually been responsible
p70
aVas a client for a new bus
p71
aVfor 50 years.
p72
aVAnd so we've been very lucky to have a chance to work.
p73
aVThe brief is that the bus should use 40 percent less energy.
p74
aVSo it's got hybrid drive.
p75
aVAnd we've been working
p76
aVto try to improve
p77
aVeverything from the fabric
p78
aVto the format
p79
aVand structure
p80
aVand aesthetics.
p81
aa(lp82
VI was going to show four main projects.
p83
aVAnd this is a project for a bridge.
p84
aVAnd so we were commissioned to design a bridge that would open.
p85
aVAnd openings seemed \u2014
p86
aVeveryone loves opening bridges,
p87
aVbut it's quite a basic thing.
p88
aVI think we all kind of stand and watch.
p89
aVBut the bridges that we saw
p90
aVthat opened and closed \u2014
p91
aVI'm slightly squeamish \u2014
p92
aVbut I once saw a photograph of a footballer
p93
aVwho was diving for a ball.
p94
aVAnd as he was diving, someone had stamped on his knee,
p95
aVand it had broken like this.
p96
aVAnd then we looked at these kinds of bridges
p97
aVand just couldn't help feeling
p98
aVthat it was a beautiful thing that had broken.
p99
aa(lp100
VAnd so this is in Paddington in London.
p101
aVAnd it's a very boring bridge, as you can see.
p102
aVIt's just steel and timber.
p103
aVBut instead of what it is,
p104
aVour focus was on the way it worked.
p105
aV(Applause)
p106
aVSo we liked the idea that the two farthest bits of it
p107
aVwould end up kissing each other.
p108
aV(Applause)
p109
aVWe actually had to halve its speed,
p110
aVbecause everyone was too scared when we first did it.
p111
aVSo that's it speeded up.
p112
aa(lp113
VA project that we've been working on very recently
p114
aVis to design a new biomass power station \u2014
p115
aVso a power station that uses organic waste material.
p116
aVIn the news,
p117
aVthe subject of where our future water is going to come from
p118
aVand where our power is going to come from
p119
aVis in all the papers all the time.
p120
aVAnd we used to be quite proud of the way we generated power.
p121
aVBut recently,
p122
aVany annual report of a power company
p123
aVdoesn't have a power station on it.
p124
aVIt has a child running through a field, or something like that.
p125
aa(lp126
V(Laughter)
p127
aa(lp128
VAnd so when a consortium of engineers approached us
p129
aVand asked us to work with them on this power station,
p130
aVour condition was that we would work with them
p131
aVand that, whatever we did,
p132
aVwe were not just going to decorate a normal power station.
p133
aVAnd instead, we had to learn \u2014 we kind of forced them to teach us.
p134
aVAnd so we spent time traveling with them
p135
aVand learning about all the different elements,
p136
aVand finding that there were plenty of inefficiencies
p137
aVthat weren't being capitalized on.
p138
aVThat just taking a field and banging all these things out
p139
aVisn't necessarily the most efficient way that they could work.
p140
aa(lp141
VSo we looked at how we could compose all those elements \u2014
p142
aVinstead of just litter, create one composition.
p143
aVAnd what we found \u2014
p144
aVthis area is one of the poorest parts of Britain.
p145
aVIt was voted the worst place in Britain to live.
p146
aVAnd there are 2,000 new homes being built
p147
aVnext to this power station.
p148
aVSo it felt this has a social dimension.
p149
aVIt has a symbolic importance.
p150
aVAnd we should be proud of where our power is coming from,
p151
aVrather than something we are necessarily ashamed of.
p152
aa(lp153
VSo we were looking at how we could make a power station,
p154
aVthat, instead of keeping people out
p155
aVand having a big fence around the outside,
p156
aVcould be a place that pulls you in.
p157
aVAnd it has to be \u2014
p158
aVI'm trying to get my \u2014
p159
aV250 feet high.
p160
aVSo it felt that what we could try to do
p161
aVis make a power park
p162
aVand actually bring the whole area in,
p163
aVand using the spare soil that's there on the site,
p164
aVwe could make a power station that was silent as well.
p165
aVBecause just that soil
p166
aVcould make the acoustic difference.
p167
aVAnd we also found that we could make a more efficient structure
p168
aVand have a cost-effective way
p169
aVof making a structure to do this.
p170
aa(lp171
VThe finished project
p172
aVis meant to be more than just a power station.
p173
aVIt has a space where you could have a bar mitzvah at the top.
p174
aV(Laughter)
p175
aVAnd it's a power park.
p176
aVSo people can come and really experience this
p177
aVand also look out all around the area,
p178
aVand use that height that we have to have for its function.
p179
aa(lp180
VIn Shanghai,
p181
aVwe were invited to build \u2014
p182
aVwell we weren't invited; what am I talking about.
p183
aVWe won the competition, and it was painful to get there.
p184
aV(Laughter)
p185
aVSo we won the competition to build the U.K. pavilion.
p186
aVAnd an expo
p187
aVis a totally bonkers thing.
p188
aVThere's 250 pavilions.
p189
aVIt's the world's biggest ever expo that had ever happened.
p190
aVSo there are up to a million people there everyday.
p191
aVAnd 250 countries all competing.
p192
aVAnd the British government saying,
p193
aV"You need to be in the top five."
p194
aVAnd so that became
p195
aVthe governmental goal \u2014
p196
aVis, how do you stand out in this chaos,
p197
aVwhich is an expo of stimulus?
p198
aVSo our sense was we had to do one thing,
p199
aVand only one thing,
p200
aVinstead of trying to have everything.
p201
aVAnd so what we also felt
p202
aVwas that whatever we did we couldn't do a cheesy advert for Britain.
p203
aa(lp204
V(Laughter)
p205
aa(lp206
VBut the thing that was true,
p207
aVthe expo was about the future of cities,
p208
aVand particularly the Victorians
p209
aVpioneered integrating nature into the cities.
p210
aVAnd the world's first public park of modern times
p211
aVwas in Britain.
p212
aVAnd the world's first major botanical institution
p213
aVis in London,
p214
aVand they have this extraordinary project
p215
aVwhere they've been collecting 25 percent
p216
aVof all the world's plant species.
p217
aVSo we suddenly realized that there was this thing.
p218
aVAnd everyone agrees that trees are beautiful,
p219
aVand I've never met anyone who says, "I don't like trees."
p220
aVAnd the same with flowers.
p221
aVI've never met anyone who says, "I don't like flowers."
p222
aVBut we realized that seeds \u2014
p223
aVthere's been this very serious project happening \u2014
p224
aVbut that seeds \u2014
p225
aVat these major botanical gardens,
p226
aVseeds aren't on show.
p227
aVBut you just have to go to a garden center,
p228
aVand they're in little paper packets.
p229
aVBut this phenomenal project's been happening.
p230
aVSo we realized we had to make a project
p231
aVthat would be seeds, some kind of seed cathedral.
p232
aa(lp233
VBut how could we show these teeny-weeny things?
p234
aVAnd the film "Jurassic Park" actually really helped us.
p235
aVBecause the DNA of the dinosaur that was trapped in the amber
p236
aVgave us some kind of clue
p237
aVthat these tiny things
p238
aVcould be trapped and be made to seem precious,
p239
aVrather than looking like nuts.
p240
aVSo the challenge was,
p241
aVhow are we going to bring light and expose these things?
p242
aVWe didn't want to make a separate building and have separate content.
p243
aVSo we were trying to think,
p244
aVhow could we make a whole thing emanate.
p245
aVBy the way, we had half the budget of the other Western nations.
p246
aVSo that was also in the mix
p247
aVwith the site the size of a football pitch.
p248
aVAnd so there was one particular toy that gave us a clue.
p249
aa(lp250
V(Video) Voice Over: The new Play-Doh Mop Top Hair Shop.
p251
aVSong: \u266b We've got the Mop Tops, the Play-Doh Mop Tops \u266b
p252
aV\u266b Just turn the chair and grow Play-Doh hair \u266b
p253
aV\u266b They're the Mop Tops \u266b
p254
aa(lp255
VThomas Heatherwick: Okay, you get the idea.
p256
aVSo the idea
p257
aVwas to take these 66,000 seeds
p258
aVthat they agreed to give us,
p259
aVand to take each seed and trap it
p260
aVin this precious optical hair
p261
aVand grow that through this box,
p262
aVvery simple box element,
p263
aVand make it a building
p264
aVthat could move in the wind.
p265
aVSo the whole thing can gently move when the wind blows.
p266
aVAnd inside, the daylight \u2014
p267
aVeach one is an optic
p268
aVand it brings light into the center.
p269
aVAnd by night,
p270
aVartificial light in each one
p271
aVemanates and comes out to the outside.
p272
aVAnd to make the project affordable,
p273
aVwe focused our energy.
p274
aVInstead of building a building as big as the football pitch,
p275
aVwe focused it on this one element.
p276
aVAnd the government agreed to do that
p277
aVand not do anything else,
p278
aVand focus our energy on that.
p279
aVAnd so the rest of the site was a public space.
p280
aVAnd with a million people there a day,
p281
aVit just felt like offering some public space.
p282
aa(lp283
VWe worked with an AstroTurf manufacturer
p284
aVto develop a mini-me version
p285
aVof the seed cathedral,
p286
aVso that, even if you're partially-sighted,
p287
aVthat it was kind of crunchy and soft,
p288
aVthat piece of landscape that you see there.
p289
aVAnd then, you know when a pet has an operation
p290
aVand they shave a bit of the skin
p291
aVand get rid of the fur \u2014
p292
aVin order to get you to go into the seed cathedral,
p293
aVin effect, we've shaved it.
p294
aa(lp295
VAnd inside there's nothing;
p296
aVthere's no famous actor's voice;
p297
aVthere's no projections;
p298
aVthere's no televisions; there's no color changing.
p299
aVThere's just silence
p300
aVand a cool temperature.
p301
aVAnd if a cloud goes past,
p302
aVyou can see a cloud on the tips
p303
aVwhere it's letting the light through.
p304
aVThis is the only project that we've done
p305
aVwhere the finished thing
p306
aVlooked more like a rendering than our renderings.
p307
aa(lp308
V(Laughter)
p309
aa(lp310
VA key thing was how people would interact.
p311
aVI mean, in a way it was the most serious thing
p312
aVyou could possible do at the expo.
p313
aVAnd I just wanted to show you.
p314
aVThe British government \u2014
p315
aVany government is potentially the worst client in the world
p316
aVyou could ever possibly want to have.
p317
aVAnd there was a lot of terror.
p318
aVBut there was an underlying support.
p319
aVAnd so there was a moment
p320
aVwhen suddenly \u2014 actually, the next thing.
p321
aVThis is the head of U.K. Trade and Investment,
p322
aVwho was our client,
p323
aVwith the Chinese children, using the landscape.
p324
aa(lp325
V(Video) Children: One, two, three, go.
p326
aa(lp327
V(Laughter)
p328
aa(lp329
VTH: I'm sorry about my stupid voice there.
p330
aa(lp331
V(Laughter)
p332
aa(lp333
VSo finally, texture is something.
p334
aVIn the projects we've been working on,
p335
aVthese slick buildings,
p336
aVwhere they might be a fancy shape,
p337
aVbut the materiality feels the same,
p338
aVis something that we've been trying to research really,
p339
aVand explore alternatives.
p340
aVAnd the project that we're building in Malaysia
p341
aVis apartment buildings
p342
aVfor a property developer.
p343
aVAnd it's in a piece of land
p344
aVthat's this site.
p345
aVAnd the mayor of Kuala Lumpur
p346
aVsaid that, if this developer
p347
aVwould give something that gave something back to the city,
p348
aVthey would give them more gross floor area, buildable.
p349
aVSo there was an incentive for the developer
p350
aVto really try to think about
p351
aVwhat would be better for the city.
p352
aa(lp353
VAnd the conventional thing with apartment buildings
p354
aVin this part of the world
p355
aVis you have your tower,
p356
aVand you squeeze a few trees around the edge,
p357
aVand you see cars parked.
p358
aVIt's actually only the first couple of floors that you really experience,
p359
aVand the rest of it is just for postcards.
p360
aVThe lowest value is actually the bottom part of a tower like this.
p361
aVSo if we could chop that away
p362
aVand give the building a small bottom,
p363
aVwe could take that bit and put it at the top
p364
aVwhere the greater commercial value is for a property developer.
p365
aVAnd by linking these together,
p366
aVwe could have 90 percent of the site
p367
aVas a rainforest,
p368
aVinstead of only 10 percent of scrubby trees
p369
aVand bits of road around buildings.
p370
aa(lp371
V(Applause)
p372
aa(lp373
VSo we're building these buildings.
p374
aVThey're actually identical, so it's quite cost-effective.
p375
aVThey're just chopped at different heights.
p376
aVBut the key part
p377
aVis trying to give back an extraordinary piece of landscape,
p378
aVrather than engulf it.
p379
aVAnd that's my final slide.
p380
aa(lp381
VThank you.
p382
aa(lp383
V(Applause)
p384
aa(lp385
VThank you.
p386
aa(lp387
V(Applause)
p388
aa(lp389
VJune Cohen: So thank you. Thank you, Thomas. You're a delight.
p390
aVSince we have an extra minute here,
p391
aVI thought perhaps you could tell us a little bit about these seeds,
p392
aVwhich maybe came from the shaved bit of the building.
p393
aa(lp394
VTH: These are a few of the tests we did
p395
aVwhen we were building the structure.
p396
aVSo there were 66,000 of these.
p397
aVThis optic
p398
aVwas 22 feet long.
p399
aVAnd so the daylight was just coming \u2014
p400
aVit was caught on the outside of the box
p401
aVand was coming down to illuminate each seed.
p402
aVWaterproofing the building was a bit crazy.
p403
aVBecause it's quite hard to waterproof buildings anyway,
p404
aVbut if you say you're going to drill 66,000 holes in it \u2014
p405
aVwe had quite a time.
p406
aVThere was one person in the contractors who was the right size \u2014
p407
aVand it wasn't a child \u2014
p408
aVwho could fit between them
p409
aVfor the final waterproofing of the building.
p410
