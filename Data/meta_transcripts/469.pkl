VI'm here today representing a team of artists and technologists and filmmakers
p4
aVthat worked together on a remarkable film project for the last four years.
p5
aVAnd along the way they created a breakthrough in computer visualization.
p6
aa(lp7
VSo I want to show you a clip of the film now.
p8
aVHopefully it won't stutter.
p9
aVAnd if we did our jobs well, you won't know that we were even involved.
p10
aa(lp11
VVoice (Video): I don't know how it's possible ...
p12
aVbut you seem to have more hair.
p13
aa(lp14
VBrad Pitt: What if I told you that I wasn't getting older ...
p15
aVbut I was getting younger than everybody else?
p16
aa(lp17
VI was born with some form of disease.
p18
aa(lp19
VVoice: What kind of disease?
p20
aa(lp21
VBP: I was born old.
p22
aa(lp23
VMan: I'm sorry.
p24
aa(lp25
VBP: No need to be. There's nothing wrong with old age.
p26
aa(lp27
VGirl: Are you sick?
p28
aa(lp29
VBP: I heard momma and Tizzy whisper,
p30
aVand they said I was gonna die soon.
p31
aVBut ... maybe not.
p32
aa(lp33
VGirl: You're different than anybody I've ever met.
p34
aa(lp35
VBB: There were many changes ...
p36
aVsome you could see, some you couldn't.
p37
aVHair started growing in all sorts of places,
p38
aValong with other things.
p39
aVI felt pretty good, considering.
p40
aa(lp41
VEd Ulbrich: That was a clip from "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button."
p42
aVMany of you, maybe you've seen it or you've heard of the story,
p43
aVbut what you might not know
p44
aVis that for nearly the first hour of the film,
p45
aVthe main character, Benjamin Button, who's played by Brad Pitt,
p46
aVis completely computer-generated from the neck up.
p47
aVNow, there's no use of prosthetic makeup
p48
aVor photography of Brad superimposed over another actor's body.
p49
aVWe've created a completely digital human head.
p50
aa(lp51
VSo I'd like to start with a little bit of history on the project.
p52
aVThis is based on an F. Scott Fitzgerald short story.
p53
aVIt's about a man who's born old and lives his life in reverse.
p54
aVNow, this movie has floated around Hollywood
p55
aVfor well over half a century,
p56
aVand we first got involved with the project in the early '90s,
p57
aVwith Ron Howard as the director.
p58
aVWe took a lot of meetings and we seriously considered it.
p59
aVBut at the time we had to throw in the towel.
p60
aVIt was deemed impossible.
p61
aVIt was beyond the technology of the day to depict a man aging backwards.
p62
aVThe human form, in particular the human head,
p63
aVhas been considered the Holy Grail of our industry.
p64
aa(lp65
VThe project came back to us about a decade later,
p66
aVand this time with a director named David Fincher.
p67
aVNow, Fincher is an interesting guy.
p68
aVDavid is fearless of technology,
p69
aVand he is absolutely tenacious.
p70
aVAnd David won't take "no."
p71
aVAnd David believed, like we do in the visual effects industry,
p72
aVthat anything is possible
p73
aVas long as you have enough time, resources and, of course, money.
p74
aVAnd so David had an interesting take on the film,
p75
aVand he threw a challenge at us.
p76
aVHe wanted the main character of the film to be played
p77
aVfrom the cradle to the grave by one actor.
p78
aVIt happened to be this guy.
p79
aa(lp80
VWe went through a process of elimination and a process of discovery
p81
aVwith David, and we ruled out, of course, swapping actors.
p82
aVThat was one idea: that we would have different actors,
p83
aVand we would hand off from actor to actor.
p84
aa(lp85
VWe even ruled out the idea of using makeup.
p86
aVWe realized that prosthetic makeup just wouldn't hold up,
p87
aVparticularly in close-up.
p88
aVAnd makeup is an additive process. You have to build the face up.
p89
aVAnd David wanted to carve deeply into Brad's face
p90
aVto bring the aging to this character.
p91
aVHe needed to be a very sympathetic character.
p92
aVSo we decided to cast a series of little people
p93
aVthat would play the different bodies of Benjamin
p94
aVat the different increments of his life
p95
aVand that we would in fact create a computer-generated version of Brad's head,
p96
aVaged to appear as Benjamin,
p97
aVand attach that to the body of the real actor.
p98
aVSounded great.
p99
aa(lp100
VOf course, this was the Holy Grail of our industry,
p101
aVand the fact that this guy is a global icon didn't help either,
p102
aVbecause I'm sure if any of you ever stand in line at the grocery store,
p103
aVyou know \u2014 we see his face constantly.
p104
aVSo there really was no tolerable margin of error.
p105
aVThere were two studios involved: Warner Brothers and Paramount.
p106
aVAnd they both believed this would make an amazing film, of course,
p107
aVbut it was a very high-risk proposition.
p108
aVThere was lots of money and reputations at stake.
p109
aVBut we believed that we had a very solid methodology
p110
aVthat might work ...
p111
aa(lp112
VBut despite our verbal assurances,
p113
aVthey wanted some proof.
p114
aVAnd so, in 2004, they commissioned us to do a screen test of Benjamin.
p115
aVAnd we did it in about five weeks.
p116
aVBut we used lots of cheats and shortcuts.
p117
aVWe basically put something together to get through the meeting.
p118
aVI'll roll that for you now. This was the first test for Benjamin Button.
p119
aVAnd in here, you can see, that's a computer-generated head \u2014
p120
aVpretty good \u2014 attached to the body of an actor.
p121
aVAnd it worked. And it gave the studio great relief.
p122
aVAfter many years of starts and stops on this project,
p123
aVand making that tough decision,
p124
aVthey finally decided to greenlight the movie.
p125
aVAnd I can remember, actually, when I got the phone call to congratulate us,
p126
aVto say the movie was a go,
p127
aVI actually threw up.
p128
aV(Laughter)
p129
aVYou know, this is some tough stuff.
p130
aa(lp131
VSo we started to have early team meetings,
p132
aVand we got everybody together,
p133
aVand it was really more like therapy in the beginning,
p134
aVconvincing each other and reassuring each other that we could actually undertake this.
p135
aVWe had to hold up an hour of a movie with a character.
p136
aVAnd it's not a special effects film; it has to be a man.
p137
aVWe really felt like we were in a \u2014 kind of a 12-step program.
p138
aVAnd of course, the first step is: admit you've got a problem. (Laughter)
p139
aVSo we had a big problem:
p140
aVwe didn't know how we were going to do this.
p141
aVBut we did know one thing.
p142
aVBeing from the visual effects industry,
p143
aVwe, with David, believed that we now had enough time,
p144
aVenough resources, and, God, we hoped we had enough money.
p145
aVAnd we had enough passion to will the processes and technology into existence.
p146
aa(lp147
VSo, when you're faced with something like that,
p148
aVof course you've got to break it down.
p149
aVYou take the big problem and you break it down into smaller pieces
p150
aVand you start to attack that.
p151
aVSo we had three main areas that we had to focus on.
p152
aVWe needed to make Brad look a lot older \u2014
p153
aVneeded to age him 45 years or so.
p154
aVAnd we also needed to make sure that we could take Brad's idiosyncrasies,
p155
aVhis little tics, the little subtleties that make him who he is
p156
aVand have that translate through our process
p157
aVso that it appears in Benjamin on the screen.
p158
aa(lp159
VAnd we also needed to create a character
p160
aVthat could hold up under, really, all conditions.
p161
aVHe needed to be able to walk in broad daylight,
p162
aVat nighttime, under candlelight,
p163
aVhe had to hold an extreme close-up,
p164
aVhe had to deliver dialogue,
p165
aVhe had to be able to run, he had to be able to sweat,
p166
aVhe had to be able to take a bath, to cry,
p167
aVhe even had to throw up.
p168
aVNot all at the same time \u2014
p169
aVbut he had to, you know, do all of those things.
p170
aa(lp171
VAnd the work had to hold up for almost the first hour of the movie.
p172
aVWe did about 325 shots.
p173
aVSo we needed a system that would allow Benjamin
p174
aVto do everything a human being can do.
p175
aVAnd we realized that there was a giant chasm
p176
aVbetween the state of the art of technology in 2004
p177
aVand where we needed it to be.
p178
aa(lp179
VSo we focused on motion capture.
p180
aVI'm sure many of you have seen motion capture.
p181
aVThe state of the art at the time
p182
aVwas something called marker-based motion capture.
p183
aVI'll give you an example here.
p184
aVIt's basically the idea of, you wear a leotard,
p185
aVand they put some reflective markers on your body,
p186
aVand instead of using cameras,
p187
aVthere're infrared sensors around a volume,
p188
aVand those infrared sensors track the three-dimensional position
p189
aVof those markers in real time.
p190
aVAnd then animators can take the data of the motion of those markers
p191
aVand apply them to a computer-generated character.
p192
aVYou can see the computer characters on the right
p193
aVare having the same complex motion as the dancers.
p194
aa(lp195
VBut we also looked at numbers of other films at the time
p196
aVthat were using facial marker tracking,
p197
aVand that's the idea of putting markers on the human face
p198
aVand doing the same process.
p199
aVAnd as you can see, it gives you a pretty crappy performance.
p200
aVThat's not terribly compelling.
p201
aVAnd what we realized
p202
aVwas that what we needed
p203
aVwas the information that was going on between the markers.
p204
aVWe needed the subtleties of the skin.
p205
aVWe needed to see skin moving over muscle moving over bone.
p206
aVWe needed creases and dimples and wrinkles and all of those things.
p207
aa(lp208
VOur first revelation was to completely abort and walk away from
p209
aVthe technology of the day, the status quo, the state of the art.
p210
aVSo we aborted using motion capture.
p211
aVAnd we were now well out of our comfort zone,
p212
aVand in uncharted territory.
p213
aVSo we were left with this idea
p214
aVthat we ended up calling "technology stew."
p215
aVWe started to look out in other fields.
p216
aVThe idea was that we were going to find
p217
aVnuggets or gems of technology
p218
aVthat come from other industries like medical imaging,
p219
aVthe video game space,
p220
aVand re-appropriate them.
p221
aVAnd we had to create kind of a sauce.
p222
aVAnd the sauce was code in software
p223
aVthat we'd written to allow these disparate pieces of technology
p224
aVto come together and work as one.
p225
aa(lp226
VInitially, we came across some remarkable research
p227
aVdone by a gentleman named Dr. Paul Ekman in the early '70s.
p228
aVHe believed that he could, in fact,
p229
aVcatalog the human face.
p230
aVAnd he came up with this idea of Facial Action Coding System, or FACS.
p231
aVHe believed that there were 70 basic poses
p232
aVor shapes of the human face,
p233
aVand that those basic poses or shapes of the face
p234
aVcan be combined to create infinite possibilities
p235
aVof everything the human face is capable of doing.
p236
aVAnd of course, these transcend age, race, culture, gender.
p237
aVSo this became the foundation of our research as we went forward.
p238
aa(lp239
VAnd then we came across some remarkable technology
p240
aVcalled Contour.
p241
aVAnd here you can see a subject having phosphorus makeup
p242
aVstippled on her face.
p243
aVAnd now what we're looking at is really creating a surface capture
p244
aVas opposed to a marker capture.
p245
aVThe subject stands in front of a computer array of cameras,
p246
aVand those cameras can, frame-by-frame,
p247
aVreconstruct the geometry of exactly what the subject's doing at the moment.
p248
aVSo, effectively, you get 3D data in real time of the subject.
p249
aVAnd if you look in a comparison,
p250
aVon the left, we see what volumetric data gives us
p251
aVand on the right you see what markers give us.
p252
aVSo, clearly, we were in a substantially better place for this.
p253
aVBut these were the early days of this technology,
p254
aVand it wasn't really proven yet.
p255
aVWe measure complexity and fidelity of data
p256
aVin terms of polygonal count.
p257
aVAnd so, on the left, we were seeing 100,000 polygons.
p258
aVWe could go up into the millions of polygons.
p259
aVIt seemed to be infinite.
p260
aa(lp261
VThis was when we had our "Aha!"
p262
aVThis was the breakthrough.
p263
aVThis is when we're like, "OK, we're going to be OK,
p264
aVThis is actually going to work."
p265
aVAnd the "Aha!" was, what if we could take Brad Pitt,
p266
aVand we could put Brad in this device,
p267
aVand use this Contour process,
p268
aVand we could stipple on this phosphorescent makeup
p269
aVand put him under the black lights,
p270
aVand we could, in fact, scan him in real time
p271
aVperforming Ekman's FACS poses.
p272
aVRight? So, effectively,
p273
aVwe ended up with a 3D database
p274
aVof everything Brad Pitt's face is capable of doing.
p275
aV(Laughter)
p276
aa(lp277
VFrom there, we actually carved up those faces
p278
aVinto smaller pieces and components of his face.
p279
aVSo we ended up with literally thousands and thousands and thousands of shapes,
p280
aVa complete database of all possibilities
p281
aVthat his face is capable of doing.
p282
aa(lp283
VNow, that's great, except we had him at age 44.
p284
aVWe need to put another 40 years on him at this point.
p285
aVWe brought in Rick Baker,
p286
aVand Rick is one of the great makeup and special effects gurus
p287
aVof our industry.
p288
aVAnd we also brought in a gentleman named Kazu Tsuji,
p289
aVand Kazu Tsuji is one of the great photorealist sculptors of our time.
p290
aVAnd we commissioned them to make a maquette,
p291
aVor a bust, of Benjamin.
p292
aVSo, in the spirit of "The Great Unveiling" \u2014 I had to do this \u2014
p293
aVI had to unveil something.
p294
aVSo this is Ben 80.
p295
aVWe created three of these:
p296
aVthere's Ben 80, there's Ben 70, there's Ben 60.
p297
aVAnd this really became the template for moving forward.
p298
aa(lp299
VNow, this was made from a life cast of Brad.
p300
aVSo, in fact, anatomically, it is correct.
p301
aVThe eyes, the jaw, the teeth:
p302
aVeverything is in perfect alignment with what the real guy has.
p303
aVWe have these maquettes scanned into the computer
p304
aVat very high resolution \u2014
p305
aVenormous polygonal count.
p306
aVAnd so now we had three age increments of Benjamin
p307
aVin the computer.
p308
aa(lp309
VBut we needed to get a database of him doing more than that.
p310
aVWe went through this process, then, called retargeting.
p311
aVThis is Brad doing one of the Ekman FACS poses.
p312
aVAnd here's the resulting data that comes from that,
p313
aVthe model that comes from that.
p314
aVRetargeting is the process of transposing that data
p315
aVonto another model.
p316
aVAnd because the life cast, or the bust \u2014 the maquette \u2014 of Benjamin
p317
aVwas made from Brad,
p318
aVwe could transpose the data of Brad at 44
p319
aVonto Brad at 87.
p320
aVSo now, we had a 3D database of everything Brad Pitt's face can do
p321
aVat age 87, in his 70s and in his 60s.
p322
aa(lp323
VNext we had to go into the shooting process.
p324
aVSo while all that's going on,
p325
aVwe're down in New Orleans and locations around the world.
p326
aVAnd we shot our body actors,
p327
aVand we shot them wearing blue hoods.
p328
aVSo these are the gentleman who played Benjamin.
p329
aVAnd the blue hoods helped us with two things:
p330
aVone, we could easily erase their heads;
p331
aVand we also put tracking markers on their heads
p332
aVso we could recreate the camera motion
p333
aVand the lens optics from the set.
p334
aa(lp335
VBut now we needed to get Brad's performance to drive our virtual Benjamin.
p336
aVAnd so we edited the footage that was shot on location
p337
aVwith the rest of the cast and the body actors
p338
aVand about six months later
p339
aVwe brought Brad onto a sound stage in Los Angeles
p340
aVand he watched on the screen.
p341
aVHis job, then, was to become Benjamin.
p342
aVAnd so we looped the scenes.
p343
aVHe watched again and again.
p344
aVWe encouraged him to improvise.
p345
aVAnd he took Benjamin into interesting and unusual places
p346
aVthat we didn't think he was going to go.
p347
aVWe shot him with four HD cameras
p348
aVso we'd get multiple views of him
p349
aVand then David would choose the take of Brad being Benjamin
p350
aVthat he thought best matched the footage
p351
aVwith the rest of the cast.
p352
aa(lp353
VFrom there we went into a process called image analysis.
p354
aVAnd so here, you can see again, the chosen take.
p355
aVAnd you are seeing, now, that data being transposed on to Ben 87.
p356
aVAnd so, what's interesting about this is
p357
aVwe used something called image analysis,
p358
aVwhich is taking timings from different components of Benjamin's face.
p359
aVAnd so we could choose, say, his left eyebrow.
p360
aVAnd the software would tell us that, well,
p361
aVin frame 14 the left eyebrow begins to move from here to here,
p362
aVand it concludes moving in frame 32.
p363
aVAnd so we could choose numbers of positions on the face
p364
aVto pull that data from.
p365
aa(lp366
VAnd then, the sauce I talked about with our technology stew \u2014
p367
aVthat secret sauce was, effectively, software that allowed us to
p368
aVmatch the performance footage of Brad
p369
aVin live action with our database of aged Benjamin,
p370
aVthe FACS shapes that we had.
p371
aVOn a frame-by-frame basis,
p372
aVwe could actually reconstruct a 3D head
p373
aVthat exactly matched the performance of Brad.
p374
aa(lp375
VSo this was how the finished shot appeared in the film.
p376
aVAnd here you can see the body actor.
p377
aVAnd then this is what we called the "dead head," no reference to Jerry Garcia.
p378
aa(lp379
VAnd then here's the reconstructed performance
p380
aVnow with the timings of the performance.
p381
aVAnd then, again, the final shot.
p382
aVIt was a long process.
p383
aV(Applause)
p384
aa(lp385
VThe next section here, I'm going to just blast through this,
p386
aVbecause we could do a whole TEDTalk on the next several slides.
p387
aa(lp388
VWe had to create a lighting system.
p389
aVSo really, a big part of our processes was creating a lighting environment
p390
aVfor every single location that Benjamin had to appear
p391
aVso that we could put Ben's head into any scene
p392
aVand it would exactly match the lighting that's on the other actors
p393
aVin the real world.
p394
aa(lp395
VWe also had to create an eye system.
p396
aVWe found the old adage, you know,
p397
aV"The eyes are the window to the soul,"
p398
aVabsolutely true.
p399
aVSo the key here was to keep everybody looking in Ben's eyes.
p400
aVAnd if you could feel the warmth, and feel the humanity,
p401
aVand feel his intent coming through the eyes,
p402
aVthen we would succeed.
p403
aVSo we had one person focused on the eye system
p404
aVfor almost two full years.
p405
aa(lp406
VWe also had to create a mouth system.
p407
aVWe worked from dental molds of Brad.
p408
aVWe had to age the teeth over time.
p409
aa(lp410
VWe also had to create an articulating tongue that allowed him to enunciate his words.
p411
aVThere was a whole system written in software to articulate the tongue.
p412
aVWe had one person devoted to the tongue for about nine months.
p413
aVHe was very popular.
p414
aa(lp415
VSkin displacement: another big deal.
p416
aVThe skin had to be absolutely accurate.
p417
aVHe's also in an old age home, he's in a nursing home
p418
aVaround other old people,
p419
aVso he had to look exactly the same as the others.
p420
aVSo, lots of work on skin deformation,
p421
aVyou can see in some of these cases it works,
p422
aVin some cases it looks bad.
p423
aVThis is a very, very, very early test in our process.
p424
aVSo, effectively we created a digital puppet
p425
aVthat Brad Pitt could operate with his own face.
p426
aVThere were no animators necessary to come in and interpret behavior
p427
aVor enhance his performance.
p428
aa(lp429
VThere was something that we encountered, though,
p430
aVthat we ended up calling "the digital Botox effect."
p431
aVSo, as things went through this process,
p432
aVFincher would always say, "It sandblasts the edges off of the performance."
p433
aVAnd thing our process and the technology couldn't do,
p434
aVis they couldn't understand intent,
p435
aVthe intent of the actor.
p436
aVSo it sees a smile as a smile.
p437
aVIt doesn't recognize an ironic smile, or a happy smile,
p438
aVor a frustrated smile.
p439
aVSo it did take humans to kind of push it one way or another.
p440
aa(lp441
VBut we ended up calling the entire process
