VThere's a big question at the center of life
p4
aVin our democracies today:
p5
aVHow do we fight terror without destroying democracies,
p6
aVwithout trampling human rights?
p7
aa(lp8
VI've spent much of my career working with journalists,
p9
aVwith bloggers,
p10
aVwith activists,
p11
aVwith human rights researchers all around the world,
p12
aVand I've come to the conclusion
p13
aVthat if our democratic societies do not double down
p14
aVon protecting and defending human rights,
p15
aVfreedom of the press
p16
aVand a free and open internet,
p17
aVradical extremist ideologies are much more likely to persist.
p18
aa(lp19
V(Applause)
p20
aa(lp21
VOK, all done. Thank you very much.
p22
aVNo, just joking.
p23
aa(lp24
V(Laughter)
p25
aa(lp26
VI actually want to drill down on this a little bit.
p27
aa(lp28
VSo, one of the countries that has been on the frontlines of this issue
p29
aVis Tunisia,
p30
aVwhich was the only country to come out of the Arab Spring
p31
aVwith a successful democratic revolution.
p32
aVFive years later,
p33
aVthey're struggling with serious terror attacks
p34
aVand rampant ISIS recruitment.
p35
aVAnd many Tunisians are calling on their government
p36
aVto do whatever it takes to keep them safe.
p37
aa(lp38
VTunisian cartoonist Nadia Khiari
p39
aVhas summed up the situation with this character who says,
p40
aV"I don't give a damn about human rights.
p41
aVI don't give a damn about the revolution.
p42
aVI don't give a damn about democracy and liberty.
p43
aVI just want to be safe."
p44
aa(lp45
V"Satisfied?" asked his jailer.
p46
aV"You're safe now."
p47
aa(lp48
VIf the Tunisian people can figure out
p49
aVhow to deal with their terrorism problem
p50
aVwithout ending up in this place,
p51
aVthey will be a model not only for their region,
p52
aVbut for all of us.
p53
aa(lp54
VThe reality is that civil society, journalists and activists
p55
aVare coming under attack from extremist groups on the one hand,
p56
aVand, in many countries,
p57
aValso from their own governments.
p58
aVWe're seeing bloggers and journalists being jailed,
p59
aVcharged and intimidated
p60
aVby their own governments,
p61
aVmany of which are allies with the West in the war on terror.
p62
aa(lp63
VJust three examples.
p64
aVA friend and former colleague of mine,
p65
aVHisham Almiraat,
p66
aVhas been charged with threatening state security,
p67
aValong with six other activists in Morocco.
p68
aVThe Saudi blogger Raif Badawi has been jailed and flogged
p69
aVfor insulting Islam and criticizing the Saudi regime on his blog.
p70
aVMore recently, the Turkish representative for Reporters Without Borders,
p71
aVErol Önderoglu,
p72
aVhas been detained and charged with spreading terrorist propaganda,
p73
aVbecause he and some other activists have been supporting Kurdish media.
p74
aa(lp75
VAnti-terror measures quickly turn into state repression
p76
aVwithout strong protection for minority communities
p77
aVand for peaceful debate;
p78
aVthis needs to be supported by a robust, independent local media.
p79
aa(lp80
VBut while that's not really happening,
p81
aVWashington is teaming up with Silicon Valley and with Hollywood
p82
aVto pour millions \u2014 hundreds of millions of dollars \u2014
p83
aVinto what's called "counter-messaging,"
p84
aVa fancy word for propaganda.
p85
aVTo counter the terrorist propaganda spreading all over the internet,
p86
aVin Europe, Internet Referral Units are being set up,
p87
aVso that people can report on extremist content that they find
p88
aVand get it censored.
p89
aVThe problem is,
p90
aVthat all of this propaganda, monitoring and censorship
p91
aVcompletely fails to make up for the fact
p92
aVthat the people who are the most credible voices,
p93
aVwho can present credible ideas and alternative solutions
p94
aVto real economic, social and political problems in their community
p95
aVthat are causing people to turn to extremism in the first place,
p96
aVare being silenced by their own governments.
p97
aa(lp98
VThis is all adding up to a decrease in freedom across the world.
p99
aVFreedom House,
p100
aVthe human rights organization,
p101
aVreports that 2015 marks the 10th straight year in a row
p102
aVof decline in freedom worldwide.
p103
aVAnd this is not just because of the actions
p104
aVof authoritarian governments.
p105
aVIt's also because democratic governments
p106
aVare increasingly cracking down on dissenters,
p107
aVwhistle-blowers
p108
aVand investigative journalists.
p109
aVUN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon has warned
p110
aVthat "preventing extremism and promoting human rights go hand-in-hand."
p111
aVIt's not to say that governments shouldn't keep us safe \u2014
p112
aVof course they should \u2014
p113
aVbut we need public oversight, transparency
p114
aVand accountability to the rule of law.
p115
aVMeanwhile,
p116
aVextremists are literally killing off civil society in some countries.
p117
aVSince 2013 in Bangladesh,
p118
aVover a dozen secular bloggers and community activists
p119
aVhave been literally slaughtered by extremists
p120
aVwhile the government has done very little.
p121
aVFrom the city of Raqqa in Syria,
p122
aVpeople like Ruqia Hassan and Naji Jerf have been assassinated
p123
aVfor their reporting out of ISIS-controlled territory.
p124
aa(lp125
VThe citizen media group called Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently
p126
aVrelies on strong encryption to send out their reports
p127
aVand shield themselves from interception and surveillance.
p128
aVYet authorities in countries like the United States,
p129
aVthe United Kingdom and many other democracies
p130
aVare seeking to use the law
p131
aVto either weaken or outright ban strong encryption,
p132
aVbecause the bad guys are using it, too.
p133
aVWe have got to fight for the right of citizens to use strong encryption.
p134
aVOtherwise, dissent and investigative journalism
p135
aVare going to become even more difficult
p136
aVin even more places.
p137
aVAnd the bad guys \u2014 the criminals and terrorists \u2014
p138
aVare still going to find ways to communicate.
p139
aVKudos to the companies that are standing up
p140
aVfor their users' right to use encryption.
p141
aa(lp142
VBut when it comes to censorship,
p143
aVthe picture is much more troubling.
p144
aVYes, there's a real problem
p145
aVof extremist content spreading all over the internet.
p146
aVAnd Facebook, YouTube and Twitter are among the many companies
p147
aVwho report having taken down hundreds of thousands of pieces of content
p148
aVand deactivating accounts
p149
aVthat are connected to the extremist's speech.
p150
aVThe problem is their enforcement mechanisms are a complete black box,
p151
aVand there is collateral damage.
p152
aa(lp153
VTake, for example, Iyad el-Baghdadi,
p154
aVan activist who makes fun of ISIS on Twitter.
p155
aVHe had his account deactivated,
p156
aVbecause he shares a surname with a prominent ISIS leader.
p157
aVLast December,
p158
aVa number of women named Isis,
p159
aVwhich also happens to be the name of an Egyptian goddess,
p160
aVhad their accounts deactivated.
p161
aVAnd this woman,
p162
aVwho lives in the United States and is a computer programmer,
p163
aVreported on Twitter about her deactivation on Facebook,
p164
aVmanaged to get enough media attention to have her account reinstated.
p165
aVBut that's the thing \u2014 she had to get media attention.
p166
aVAnd journalists aren't immune.
p167
aVDavid Thomson,
p168
aVan expert on terrorism and reporter for Radio France International,
p169
aVhad reports deleted from his Facebook account
p170
aVand had his account deactivated for several days,
p171
aVbecause they contained pictures of ISIS flags,
p172
aVeven though he was just reporting on ISIS,
p173
aVnot promoting it.
p174
aa(lp175
VAnd then we have stories from people like this Egyptian man,
p176
aVAhmed Abdellahy,
p177
aVwho reported recently in an event in Washington DC
p178
aVthat some of his arguments with extremists \u2014
p179
aVhe now spends his time on social media arguing with ISIS followers,
p180
aVtrying to get them to turn away \u2014
p181
aVsome of his arguments with these extremists get deleted,
p182
aVwhich he believes has the effect of shielding them
p183
aVfrom alternative points of view.
p184
aa(lp185
VIt's unclear whether Facebook even knows the extent
p186
aVof the collateral damage,
p187
aVor the other companies as well.
p188
aVBut we do know that journalism, activism and public debate
p189
aVare being silenced in the effort to stamp out extremist speech.
p190
aa(lp191
VSo with these companies having so much power over the public discourse,
p192
aVthey need to be held accountable.
p193
aVThey need to carry out impact assessment
p194
aVto identify and fix the problems that we're clearly seeing.
p195
aVThey need to be more transparent about their enforcement mechanisms,
p196
aVand they need to have clear appeal and grievance mechanisms,
p197
aVso people can get their content reinstated.
p198
aa(lp199
VNow, I've been talking for the last 10 minutes
p200
aVabout how governments and companies are making it more difficult
p201
aVfor people like these.
p202
aVThis is a picture of members of the citizen media network,
p203
aVGlobal Voices,
p204
aVthat I helped to cofound over 10 years ago
p205
aVwith my friend, Ethan Zuckerman.
p206
aVInterestingly, about 5 years ago, right after the Arab Spring,
p207
aVthe data scientist Gilad Lotan
p208
aVcreated a network map of the people in Global Voices
p209
aVwho were heavy users of Twitter during the Arab Spring.
p210
aVAnd he found that many of these people served as key information nodes
p211
aVbetween activists and journalists
p212
aVthroughout the Tunisian and Egyptian revolution.
p213
aVWe've got to make sure that these people not only survive,
p214
aVbut are able to continue to thrive.
p215
aVMany of them are still active,
p216
aVother than the ones who have gone to jail
p217
aVor have been driven into hiding or exile.
p218
aa(lp219
VAll around the world,
p220
aVpeople who are sick and tired of fear and oppression
p221
aVare linking up in their communities and across borders.
p222
aVWe've got to do everything we can to push our governments and companies
p223
aVto do a better job of protecting their rights.
p224
aVWe've also got to be more mindful
p225
aVabout how our own personal, political, consumer and business choices
p226
aVaffect people like these around the world.
p227
aVAlso, if you follow the news,
p228
aVit's pretty clear that that alone isn't going to be enough.
p229
aVWe've got to take personal responsibility by joining \u2014
p230
aVor at very least, actively supporting \u2014
p231
aVthe growing ecosystem of individuals and groups
p232
aVwho are fighting for social justice,
p233
aVenvironmental sustainability,
p234
aVgovernment accountability,
p235
aVhuman rights, freedom of the press
p236
aVand a free and open internet,
p237
aVall around the world.
p238
aa(lp239
VI believe that, ultimately, we can overcome
p240
aVthe digitally empowered networks of extremism, demagoguery and hate.
p241
aVBut ...
p242
aVwe've got to do this by really beefing up the global networks
p243
aVof citizens around the world,
p244
aVpowered by people who are working hard every day,
p245
aVand taking personal risk
p246
aVfor a future world that is more peaceful, just, open and free.
p247
