VI am multidisciplinary.
p4
aa(lp5
VAs a scientist, I've been a crew commander for a NASA Mars simulation last year,
p6
aVand as an artist, I create multicultural community art all over the planet.
p7
aVAnd recently, I've actually been combining both.
p8
aVBut let me first talk a little more about that NASA mission.
p9
aa(lp10
VThis is the HI-SEAS program.
p11
aVHI-SEAS is a NASA-funded planetary surface analogue
p12
aVon the Mauna Loa volcano in Hawaii,
p13
aVand it's a research program that is specifically designed
p14
aVto study the effects of long-term isolation of small crews.
p15
aVI lived in this dome for four months with a crew of six,
p16
aVa very interesting experience, of course.
p17
aVWe did all kinds of research.
p18
aVOur main research was actually a food study,
p19
aVbut apart from that food study \u2014
p20
aVdeveloping a new food system for astronauts living in deep space \u2014
p21
aVwe also did all kinds of other research.
p22
aVWe did extra-vehicular activities, as you can see here,
p23
aVwearing mock-up space suits,
p24
aVbut we also had our chores and lots of other stuff to do,
p25
aVlike questionnaires at the end of every day.
p26
aVBusy, busy work.
p27
aa(lp28
VNow, as you can imagine,
p29
aVit's quite challenging to live with just a small group of people
p30
aVin a small space for a long time.
p31
aVThere's all kinds of psychological challenges:
p32
aVhow to keep a team together in these circumstances;
p33
aVhow to deal with the warping of time you start to sense
p34
aVwhen you're living in these circumstances;
p35
aVsleep problems that arise; etc.
p36
aVBut also we learned a lot.
p37
aVI learned a lot about how individual crew members
p38
aVactually cope with a situation like this;
p39
aVhow you can keep a crew productive and happy,
p40
aVfor example, giving them a good deal of autonomy
p41
aVis a good trick to do that;
p42
aVand honestly, I learned a lot about leadership,
p43
aVbecause I was a crew commander.
p44
aa(lp45
VSo doing this mission,
p46
aVI really started thinking more deeply about our future in outer space.
p47
aVWe will venture into outer space, and we will start inhabiting outer space.
p48
aVI have no doubt about it.
p49
aVIt might take 50 years or it might take 500 years,
p50
aVbut it's going to happen nevertheless.
p51
aVSo I came up with a new art project called Seeker.
p52
aVAnd the Seeker project is actually challenging communities all over the world
p53
aVto come up with starship prototypes
p54
aVthat re-envision human habitation and survival.
p55
aVThat's the core of the project.
p56
aa(lp57
VNow, one important thing:
p58
aVThis is not a dystopian project.
p59
aVThis is not about, "Oh my God, the world is going wrong
p60
aVand we have to escape because we need another future somewhere else."
p61
aVNo, no.
p62
aVThe project is basically inviting people
p63
aVto take a step away from earthbound constraints
p64
aVand, as such, reimagine our future.
p65
aVAnd it's really helpful, and it works really well,
p66
aVso that's really the important part of what we're doing.
p67
aa(lp68
VNow, in this project, I'm using a cocreation approach,
p69
aVwhich is a slightly different approach
p70
aVfrom what you would expect from many artists.
p71
aVI'm essentially dropping a basic idea into a group, into a community,
p72
aVpeople start gravitating to the idea,
p73
aVand together, we shape  and build the artwork.
p74
aVIt's a little bit like termites, really.
p75
aVWe just work together,
p76
aVand even, for example, when architects visit what we're doing,
p77
aVsometimes they have a bit of a hard time understanding
p78
aVhow we build without a master plan.
p79
aVWe always come up with these fantastic large-scale scupltures
p80
aVthat actually we can also inhabit.
p81
aVThe first version was done in Belgium and Holland.
p82
aVIt was built with a team of almost 50 people.
p83
aVThis is the second iteration of that same project,
p84
aVbut in Slovenia, in a different country,
p85
aVand the new group was like, we're going  to do the architecture differently.
p86
aVSo they took away the architecture, they kept the base of the artwork,
p87
aVand they built an entirely new,
p88
aVmuch more biomorphic architecture on top of that.
p89
aVAnd that's another crucial part of the project.
p90
aVIt's an evolving artwork, evolving architecture.
p91
aVThis was the last version that was just presented a few weeks ago in Holland,
p92
aVwhich was using caravans  as modules to build a starship.
p93
aVWe bought some second-hand caravans,
p94
aVcut them open,
p95
aVand reassembled them into a starship.
p96
aa(lp97
VNow, when we're thinking about starships,
p98
aVwe're not just approaching it as a technological challenge.
p99
aVWe're really looking at it as a combination of three systems:
p100
aVecology, people and technology.
p101
aVSo there's always a strong ecological component in the project.
p102
aVHere you can see aquaponic systems
p103
aVthat are actually surrounding the astronauts,
p104
aVso they're constantly in contact with part of the food that they're eating.
p105
aa(lp106
VNow, a very typical thing for this project
p107
aVis that we run our own isolation missions inside these art and design projects.
p108
aVWe actually lock ourselves up for multiple days on end,
p109
aVand test what we build.
p110
aVAnd this is, for example,
p111
aVon the right hand side you can see an isolation mission
p112
aVin the Museum of Modern Art in Ljubljana in Slovenia,
p113
aVwhere six artists and designers locked themselves up \u2014
p114
aVI was part of that \u2014
p115
aVfor four days inside the museum.
p116
aVAnd, of course, obviously, this is a very performative
p117
aVand very strong experience for all of us.
p118
aa(lp119
VNow, the next version of the project is currently being developed
p120
aVtogether with Camilo Rodriguez-Beltran, who is also a TED Fellow,
p121
aVin the Atacama Desert in Chile, a magical place.
p122
aVFirst of all, it's really considered a Mars analogue.
p123
aVIt really does look like Mars in certain locations
p124
aVand has been used by NASA to test equipment.
p125
aVAnd it has a long history of being connected to space
p126
aVthrough observations of the stars.
p127
aVIt's now home to ALMA,
p128
aVthe large telescope that's being developed there.
p129
aVBut also, it's the driest location on the planet,
p130
aVand that makes it extremely interesting to build our project,
p131
aVbecause suddenly, sustainability is something we have to explore fully.
p132
aVWe have no other option,
p133
aVso I'm very curious to see what's going to happen.
p134
aa(lp135
VNow, a specific thing for this particular version of the project
p136
aVis that I'm very interested to see
p137
aVhow we can connect with the local population,
p138
aVthe native population.
p139
aVThese people have been living there for a very long time
p140
aVand can be considered experts in sustainability,
p141
aVand so I'm very interested to see what we can learn from them,
p142
aVand have an input of indigenous knowledge into space exploration.
p143
aa(lp144
VSo we're trying to redefine how we look at our future in outer space
p145
aVby exploring integration, biology, technology and people;
p146
aVby using a cocreation approach;
p147
aVand by using and exploring local traditions
p148
aVand to see how we can learn from the past and integrate that into our deep future.
