VThank you.
p4
aVAnd I feel like this whole evening has been very amazing to me.
p5
aVI feel it's sort of like the Vimalakirti Sutra,
p6
aVan ancient work from ancient India
p7
aVin which the Buddha appears at the beginning and a whole bunch of people
p8
aVcome to see him from the biggest city in the area, Vaishali,
p9
aVand they bring some sort of jeweled parasols to make an offering to him.
p10
aVAll the young people, actually, from the city.
p11
aVThe old fogeys don't come because they're mad at Buddha,
p12
aVbecause when he came to their city he accepted \u2014
p13
aVhe always accepts the first invitation that comes to him, from whoever it is,
p14
aVand the local geisha, a movie-star sort of person,
p15
aVraced the elders of the city in a chariot and invited him first.
p16
aa(lp17
VSo he was hanging out with the movie star, and of course they were grumbling:
p18
aV"He's supposed to be religious and all this.
p19
aVWhat's he doing over there at Amrapali's house with all his 500 monks,"
p20
aVand so on. They were all grumbling, and so they boycotted him.
p21
aVThey wouldn't go listen to him.
p22
aVBut the young people all came.
p23
aVAnd they brought this kind of a jeweled parasol, and they put it on the ground.
p24
aVAnd as soon as they had laid all these,
p25
aVall their big stack of these jeweled parasols that they used to carry in ancient India,
p26
aVhe performed a kind of special effect which made it into a giant planetarium,
p27
aVthe wonder of the universe. Everyone looked in that, and they saw in there
p28
aVthe total interconnectedness of all life in all universes.
p29
aa(lp30
VAnd of course, in the Buddhist cosmos there are millions and billions of planets
p31
aVwith human life on it,
p32
aVand enlightened beings can see the life on all the other planets.
p33
aVSo they don't \u2014 when they look out and they see those lights that you showed
p34
aVin the sky \u2014 they don't just see sort of pieces of matter burning
p35
aVor rocks or flames or gases exploding.
p36
aVThey actually see landscapes and human beings
p37
aVand gods and dragons and serpent beings and goddesses and things like that.
p38
aa(lp39
VHe made that special effect at the beginning
p40
aVto get everyone to think about interconnection
p41
aVand interconnectedness and how everything in life was totally interconnected.
p42
aVAnd then Leilei \u2014 I know his other name \u2014 told us about interconnection,
p43
aVand how we're all totally interconnected here,
p44
aVand how we've all known each other. And of course in the Buddhist universe,
p45
aVwe've already done this already billions of times in many, many lifetimes in the past.
p46
aVAnd I didn't give the talk always. You did, and we had to watch you, and so forth.
p47
aVAnd we're all still trying to, I guess we're all trying to become TEDsters,
p48
aVif that's a modern form of enlightenment.
p49
aVI guess so. Because in a way, if a TEDster relates to all the interconnectedness
p50
aVof all the computers and everything, it's the forging of a mass awareness,
p51
aVof where everybody can really know everything
p52
aVthat's going on everywhere in the planet.
p53
aa(lp54
VAnd therefore it will become intolerable \u2014
p55
aVwhat compassion is, is where it will become intolerable for us,
p56
aVtotally intolerable that we sit here in comfort and in pleasure and enjoying
p57
aVthe life of the mind or whatever it is,
p58
aVand there are people who are absolutely riddled with disease
p59
aVand they cannot have a bite of food and they have no place,
p60
aVor they're being brutalized by some terrible person and so forth.
p61
aVIt just becomes intolerable.
p62
aVWith all of us knowing everything, we're kind of forced by technology
p63
aVto become Buddhas or something, to become enlightened.
p64
aa(lp65
VAnd of course, we all will be deeply disappointed when we do.
p66
aVBecause we think that because we are kind of tired of what we do,
p67
aVa little bit tired, we do suffer.
p68
aVWe do enjoy our misery in a certain way.
p69
aVWe distract ourselves from our misery by running around somewhere,
p70
aVbut basically we all have this common misery
p71
aVthat we are sort of stuck inside our skins
p72
aVand everyone else is out there.
p73
aVAnd occasionally we get together with another person stuck in their skin
p74
aVand the two of us enjoy each other, and each one tries to get out of their own,
p75
aVand ultimately it fails of course, and then we're back into this thing.
p76
aa(lp77
VBecause our egocentric perception \u2014 from the Buddha's point of view, misperception \u2014
p78
aVis that all we are is what is inside our skin.
p79
aVAnd it's inside and outside, self and other,
p80
aVand other is all very different.
p81
aVAnd everyone here is unfortunately carrying that habitual perception,
p82
aVa little bit, right?
p83
aVYou know, someone sitting next to you in a seat \u2014 that's OK because you're in a theater,
p84
aVbut if you were sitting on a park bench and someone came up and sat that close to you,
p85
aVyou'd freak out.
p86
aVWhat do they want from me? Like, who's that?
p87
aVAnd so you wouldn't sit that close to another person
p88
aVbecause of your notion that it's you versus the universe \u2014 that's all Buddha discovered.
p89
aVBecause that cosmic basic idea that it is us all alone, each of us,
p90
aVand everyone else is different,
p91
aVthen that puts us in an impossible situation, doesn't it?
p92
aVWho is it who's going to get enough attention from the world?
p93
aVWho's going to get enough out of the world?
p94
aVWho's not going to be overrun by an infinite number of other beings \u2014
p95
aVif you're different from all the other beings?
p96
aa(lp97
VSo where compassion comes is where you
p98
aVsurprisingly discover you lose yourself in some way:
p99
aVthrough art, through meditation, through understanding, through knowledge actually,
p100
aVknowing that you have no such boundary,
p101
aVknowing your interconnectedness with other beings.
p102
aVYou can experience yourself as the other beings
p103
aVwhen you see through the delusion of being separated from them.
p104
aVWhen you do that, you're forced to feel what they feel.
p105
aVLuckily, they say \u2014 I still am not sure \u2014
p106
aVbut luckily, they say that when you reach that point because some people have said
p107
aVin the Buddhist literature, they say, "Oh who would really want to be compassionate?
p108
aVHow awful! I'm so miserable on my own. My head is aching.
p109
aVMy bones are aching. I go from birth to death. I'm never satisfied.
p110
aVI never have enough, even if I'm a billionaire, I don't have enough.
p111
aVI need a hundred billion." So I'm like that.
p112
aVImagine if I had to feel even a hundred other people's suffering.
p113
aVIt would be terrible.
p114
aa(lp115
VBut apparently, this is a strange paradox of life.
p116
aVWhen you're no longer locked in yourself,
p117
aVand as the wisdom or the intelligence or the scientific knowledge
p118
aVof the nature of the world, that enables you to let your mind spread out,
p119
aVand empathize, and enhance the basic human ability of empathizing,
p120
aVand realizing that you are the other being,
p121
aVsomehow by that opening, you can see the deeper nature of life. And you can,
p122
aVyou get away from this terrible iron circle of I, me, me, mine,
p123
aVlike the Beatles used to sing.
p124
aa(lp125
VYou know, we really learned everything in the '60s.
p126
aVToo bad nobody ever woke up to it,
p127
aVand they've been trying to suppress it since then.
p128
aVI, me, me, mine. It's like a perfect song, that song. A perfect teaching.
p129
aVBut when we're relieved from that,
p130
aVwe somehow then become interested in all the other beings.
p131
aVAnd we feel ourselves differently. It's totally strange.
p132
aVIt's totally strange.
p133
aVThe Dalai Lama always likes to say \u2014
p134
aVhe says that when you give birth in your mind to the idea of compassion,
p135
aVit's because you realize that you yourself and your pains and pleasures
p136
aVare finally too small a theater for your intelligence.
p137
aVIt's really too boring whether you feel like this or like that, or what, you know \u2014
p138
aVand the more you focus on how you feel, by the way, the worse it gets.
p139
aVLike, even when you're having a good time,
p140
aVwhen is the good time over?
p141
aVThe good time is over when you think, how good is it?
p142
aVAnd then it's never good enough.
p143
aa(lp144
VI love that Leilei said that the way of helping those who are suffering badly
p145
aVon the physical plane or on other planes is having a good time,
p146
aVdoing it by having a good time.
p147
aVI think the Dalai Lama should have heard that. I wish he'd been there to hear that.
p148
aVHe once told me \u2014 he looked kind of sad;
p149
aVhe worries very much about the haves and have-nots.
p150
aVHe looked a little sad, because he said, well, a hundred years ago,
p151
aVthey went and took everything away from the haves.
p152
aVYou know, the big communist revolutions, Russia and China and so forth.
p153
aVThey took it all away by violence,
p154
aVsaying they were going to give it to everyone, and then they were even worse.
p155
aVThey didn't help at all.
p156
aa(lp157
VSo what could possibly change this terrible gap that has opened up in the world today?
p158
aVAnd so then he looks at me.
p159
aVSo I said, "Well, you know, you're all in this yourself. You teach: it's generosity,"
p160
aVwas all I could think of. What is virtue?
p161
aVBut of course, what you said, I think the key to saving the world, the key to compassion
p162
aVis that it is more fun.
p163
aVIt should be done by fun. Generosity is more fun. That's the key.
p164
aVEverybody has the wrong idea. They think Buddha was so boring,
p165
aVand they're so surprised when they meet Dalai Lama and he's fairly jolly.
p166
aVEven though his people are being genocided \u2014
p167
aVand believe me, he feels every blow on every old nun's head,
p168
aVin every Chinese prison. He feels it.
p169
aVHe feels the way they are harvesting yaks nowadays.
p170
aVI won't even say what they do. But he feels it.
p171
aVAnd yet he's very jolly. He's extremely jolly.
p172
aa(lp173
VBecause when you open up like that,
p174
aVthen you can't just \u2014 what good does it do to add being miserable with others' misery?
p175
aVYou have to find some vision where you see how hopeful it is,
p176
aVhow it can be changed.
p177
aVLook at that beautiful thing Chiho showed us. She scared us with the lava man.
p178
aVShe scared us with the lava man is coming,
p179
aVthen the tsunami is coming,
p180
aVbut then finally there were flowers and trees, and it was very beautiful.
p181
aVIt's really lovely.
p182
aa(lp183
VSo, compassion means to feel the feelings of others,
p184
aVand the human being actually is compassion.
p185
aVThe human being is almost out of time.
p186
aVThe human being is compassion because what is our brain for?
p187
aVNow, Jim's brain is memorizing the almanac.
p188
aVBut he could memorize all the needs of all the beings that he is, he will, he did.
p189
aVHe could memorize all kinds of fantastic things to help many beings.
p190
aVAnd he would have tremendous fun doing that.
p191
aa(lp192
VSo the first person who gets happy,
p193
aVwhen you stop focusing on the self-centered situation of, how happy am I,
p194
aVwhere you're always dissatisfied \u2014
p195
aVas Mick Jagger told us. You never get any satisfaction that way.
p196
aVSo then you decide, "Well, I'm sick of myself.
p197
aVI'm going to think of how other people can be happy.
p198
aVI'm going to get up in the morning and think,
p199
aVwhat can I do for even one other person, even a dog, my dog, my cat,
p200
aVmy pet, my butterfly?"
p201
aVAnd the first person who gets happy when you do that,
p202
aVyou don't do anything for anybody else, but you get happier, you yourself,
p203
aVbecause your whole perception broadens
p204
aVand you suddenly see the whole world and all of the people in it.
p205
aVAnd you realize that this \u2014 being with these people \u2014
p206
aVis the flower garden that Chiho showed us.
p207
aVIt is Nirvana.
p208
aVAnd my time is up. And I know the TED commandments.
p209
aVThank you.
