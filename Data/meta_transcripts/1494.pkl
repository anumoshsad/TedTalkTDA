VSo I'm a woman with chronic schizophrenia.
p4
aVI've spent hundreds of days
p5
aVin psychiatric hospitals.
p6
aVI might have ended up spending
p7
aVmost of my life on the back ward of a hospital,
p8
aVbut that isn't how my life turned out.
p9
aVIn fact, I've managed to stay clear of hospitals
p10
aVfor almost three decades,
p11
aVperhaps my proudest accomplishment.
p12
aVThat's not to say that I've remained clear
p13
aVof all psychiatric struggles.
p14
aVAfter I graduated from the Yale Law School and
p15
aVgot my first law job, my New Haven analyst, Dr. White,
p16
aVannounced to me that he was going to close his practice
p17
aVin three months, several years
p18
aVbefore I had planned to leave New Haven.
p19
aVWhite had been enormously helpful to me,
p20
aVand the thought of his leaving
p21
aVshattered me.
p22
aa(lp23
VMy best friend Steve,
p24
aVsensing that something was terribly wrong,
p25
aVflew out to New Haven to be with me.
p26
aVNow I'm going to quote from some of my writings:
p27
aV"I opened the door to my studio apartment.
p28
aVSteve would later tell me that,
p29
aVfor all the times he had seen me psychotic, nothing
p30
aVcould have prepared him for what he saw that day.
p31
aVFor a week or more, I had barely eaten.
p32
aVI was gaunt. I walked
p33
aVas though my legs were wooden.
p34
aVMy face looked and felt like a mask.
p35
aVI had closed all the curtains in the apartment, so
p36
aVin the middle of the day
p37
aVthe apartment was in near total darkness.
p38
aVThe air was fetid, the room a shambles.
p39
aVSteve, both a lawyer and a psychologist, has treated
p40
aVmany patients with severe mental illness, and to this day
p41
aVhe'll say I was as bad as any he had ever seen.
p42
aV'Hi,' I said, and then I returned to the couch,
p43
aVwhere I sat in silence for several moments.
p44
aV'Thank you for coming, Steve.
p45
aVCrumbling world, word, voice.
p46
aVTell the clocks to stop.
p47
aVTime is. Time has come.'
p48
aV'White is leaving,' Steve said somberly.
p49
aV'I'm being pushed into a grave. The situation is grave,' I moan.
p50
aV'Gravity is pulling me down.
p51
aVI'm scared. Tell them to get away.'"
p52
aa(lp53
VAs a young woman, I was in a psychiatric hospital
p54
aVon three different occasions for lengthy periods.
p55
aVMy doctors diagnosed me with chronic schizophrenia,
p56
aVand gave me a prognosis of "grave."
p57
aVThat is, at best, I was expected to live in a board and care,
p58
aVand work at menial jobs.
p59
aVFortunately, I did not actually
p60
aVenact that grave prognosis.
p61
aVInstead, I'm a chaired Professor of Law, Psychology
p62
aVand Psychiatry at the USC Gould School of Law,
p63
aVI have many close friends
p64
aVand I have a beloved husband, Will, who's here with us today.
p65
aa(lp66
V(Applause) Thank you.
p67
aVHe's definitely the star of my show.
p68
aa(lp69
VI'd like to share with you how that happened, and also
p70
aVdescribe my experience of being psychotic.
p71
aVI hasten to add that it's my experience,
p72
aVbecause everyone becomes psychotic in his or her own way.
p73
aa(lp74
VLet's start with the definition of schizophrenia.
p75
aVSchizophrenia is a brain disease.
p76
aVIts defining feature is psychosis, or being
p77
aVout of touch with reality.
p78
aVDelusions and hallucinations
p79
aVare hallmarks of the illness.
p80
aVDelusions are fixed and false beliefs that aren't responsive
p81
aVto evidence, and hallucinations are false sensory experiences.
p82
aVFor example, when I'm psychotic I often have
p83
aVthe delusion that I've killed hundreds of thousands
p84
aVof people with my thoughts.
p85
aVI sometimes have the idea that
p86
aVnuclear explosions are about to be set off in my brain.
p87
aVOccasionally, I have hallucinations,
p88
aVlike one time I turned around and saw a man
p89
aVwith a raised knife.
p90
aVImagine having a nightmare while you're awake.
p91
aa(lp92
VOften, speech and thinking become disorganized
p93
aVto the point of incoherence.
p94
aVLoose associations involves putting together words
p95
aVthat may sound a lot alike but don't make sense,
p96
aVand if the words get jumbled up enough, it's called "word salad."
p97
aVContrary to what many people think, schizophrenia is not
p98
aVthe same as multiple personality disorder or split personality.
p99
aVThe schizophrenic mind is not split, but shattered.
p100
aa(lp101
VEveryone has seen a street person,
p102
aVunkempt, probably ill-fed,
p103
aVstanding outside of an office building muttering
p104
aVto himself or shouting.
p105
aVThis person is likely to have some form of schizophrenia.
p106
aVBut schizophrenia presents itself across a wide array
p107
aVof socioeconomic status, and there are people
p108
aVwith the illness who are full-time professionals
p109
aVwith major responsibilities.
p110
aVSeveral years ago, I decided
p111
aVto write down my experiences and my personal journey,
p112
aVand I want to share some more of that story with you today
p113
aVto convey the inside view.
p114
aa(lp115
VSo the following episode happened the seventh week
p116
aVof my first semester of my first year at Yale Law School.
p117
aVQuoting from my writings:
p118
aV"My two classmates, Rebel and Val, and I had made the date
p119
aVto meet in the law school library on Friday night
p120
aVto work on our memo assignment together.
p121
aVBut we didn't get far before I was talking in ways
p122
aVthat made no sense.
p123
aa(lp124
V'Memos are visitations,' I informed them.
p125
aV'They make certain points. The point is on your head.
p126
aVPat used to say that. Have you killed you anyone?'
p127
aVRebel and Val looked at me
p128
aVas if they or I had been
p129
aVsplashed in the face with cold water.
p130
aV'What are you talking about, Elyn?'
p131
aV'Oh, you know, the usual. Who's what, what's who,
p132
aVheaven and hell. Let's go out on the roof.
p133
aVIt's a flat surface. It's safe.'
p134
aVRebel and Val followed
p135
aVand they asked what had gotten into me.
p136
aV'This is the real me,' I announced,
p137
aVwaving my arms above my head.
p138
aVAnd then, late on a Friday night, on the roof
p139
aVof the Yale Law School,
p140
aVI began to sing, and not quietly either.
p141
aV'Come to the Florida sunshine bush.
p142
aVDo you want to dance?'
p143
aV'Are you on drugs?' one asked. 'Are you high?'
p144
aV'High? Me? No way, no drugs.
p145
aVCome to the Florida sunshine bush,
p146
aVwhere there are lemons, where they make demons.'
p147
aV'You're frightening me,' one of them said, and Rebel and Val
p148
aVheaded back into the library.
p149
aVI shrugged and followed them.
p150
aa(lp151
VBack inside, I asked my classmates if they were
p152
aVhaving the same experience of words jumping around
p153
aVour cases as I was.
p154
aV'I think someone's infiltrated my copies of the cases,' I said.
p155
aV'We've got to case the joint.
p156
aVI don't believe in joints, but
p157
aVthey do hold your body together.'" \u2014
p158
aVIt's an example of loose associations. \u2014
p159
aV"Eventually I made my way back to my dorm room,
p160
aVand once there, I couldn't settle down.
p161
aVMy head was too full of noise,
p162
aVtoo full of orange trees and law memos I could not write
p163
aVand mass murders I knew I would be responsible for.
p164
aVSitting on my bed, I rocked back and forth,
p165
aVmoaning in fear and isolation."
p166
aVThis episode led to my first hospitalization in America.
p167
aVI had two earlier in England.
p168
aa(lp169
VContinuing with the writings:
p170
aV"The next morning I went to my professor's office to ask
p171
aVfor an extension on the memo assignment,
p172
aVand I began gibbering unintelligably
p173
aVas I had the night before,
p174
aVand he eventually brought me to the emergency room.
p175
aVOnce there, someone I'll just call 'The Doctor'
p176
aVand his whole team of goons swooped down,
p177
aVlifted me high into the air,
p178
aVand slammed me down on a metal bed
p179
aVwith such force that I saw stars.
p180
aVThen they strapped my legs and arms to the metal bed
p181
aVwith thick leather straps.
p182
aVA sound came out of my mouth that I'd never heard before:
p183
aVhalf groan, half scream,
p184
aVbarely human and pure terror.
p185
aVThen the sound came again,
p186
aVforced from somewhere deep inside my belly
p187
aVand scraping my throat raw."
p188
aVThis incident resulted in my involuntary hospitalization.
p189
aVOne of the reasons the doctors gave for hospitalizing me
p190
aVagainst my will was that I was
p191
aV"gravely disabled."
p192
aVTo support this view, they wrote in my chart that I was unable
p193
aVto do my Yale Law School homework.
p194
aVI wondered what that meant about much of the rest of New Haven.
p195
aV(Laughter)
p196
aa(lp197
VDuring the next year, I would
p198
aVspend five months in a psychiatric hospital.
p199
aVAt times, I spent up to 20 hours in mechanical restraints,
p200
aVarms tied, arms and legs tied down,
p201
aVarms and legs tied down with a net tied
p202
aVtightly across my chest.
p203
aVI never struck anyone.
p204
aVI never harmed anyone. I never made any direct threats.
p205
aVIf you've never been restrained yourself, you may have
p206
aVa benign image of the experience.
p207
aVThere's nothing benign about it.
p208
aa(lp209
VEvery week in the United States,
p210
aVit's been estimated that one to three people die in restraints.
p211
aVThey strangle, they aspirate their vomit,
p212
aVthey suffocate, they have a heart attack.
p213
aVIt's unclear whether using mechanical restraints
p214
aVis actually saving lives or costing lives.
p215
aVWhile I was preparing to write my student note
p216
aVfor the Yale Law Journal on mechanical restraints,
p217
aVI consulted an eminent law professor who was also
p218
aVa psychiatrist,
p219
aVand said surely he would agree
p220
aVthat restraints must be degrading,
p221
aVpainful and frightening.
p222
aVHe looked at me in a knowing way, and said,
p223
aV"Elyn, you don't really understand:
p224
aVThese people are psychotic.
p225
aVThey're different from me and you.
p226
aVThey wouldn't experience restraints as we would."
p227
aVI didn't have the courage to tell him in that moment that,
p228
aVno, we're not that different from him.
p229
aVWe don't like to be strapped down to a bed
p230
aVand left to suffer for hours any more than he would.
p231
aVIn fact, until very recently,
p232
aVand I'm sure some people still hold it as a view,
p233
aVthat restraints help psychiatric patients feel safe.
p234
aVI've never met a psychiatric patient
p235
aVwho agreed with that view.
p236
aVToday, I'd like to say I'm very pro-psychiatry
p237
aVbut very anti-force.
p238
aVI don't think force is effective as treatment, and I think
p239
aVusing force is a terrible thing to do to another person
p240
aVwith a terrible illness.
p241
aa(lp242
VEventually, I came to Los Angeles
p243
aVto teach at the University of Southern California Law School.
p244
aVFor years, I had resisted medication,
p245
aVmaking many, many efforts to get off.
p246
aVI felt that if I could manage without medication,
p247
aVI could prove that, after all,
p248
aVI wasn't really mentally ill, it was some terrible mistake.
p249
aVMy motto was the less medicine, the less defective.
p250
aVMy L.A. analyst, Dr. Kaplan, was urging me
p251
aVjust to stay on medication and get on with my life,
p252
aVbut I decided I wanted to make one last college try to get off.
p253
aVQuoting from the text:
p254
aV"I started the reduction of my meds, and within a short time
p255
aVI began feeling the effects.
p256
aVAfter returning from a trip to Oxford, I marched into
p257
aVKaplan's office, headed straight for the corner, crouched down,
p258
aVcovered my face, and began shaking.
p259
aVAll around me I sensed evil beings poised with daggers.
p260
aVThey'd slice me up in thin slices
p261
aVor make me swallow hot coals.
p262
aVKaplan would later describe me as 'writhing in agony.'
p263
aVEven in this state, what he accurately described as
p264
aVacutely and forwardly psychotic,
p265
aVI refused to take more medication.
p266
aVThe mission is not yet complete.
p267
aa(lp268
VImmediately after the appointment with Kaplan,
p269
aVI went to see Dr. Marder, a schizophrenia expert
p270
aVwho was following me for medication side effects.
p271
aVHe was under the impression that I had a mild psychotic illness.
p272
aVOnce in his office, I sat on his couch, folded over,
p273
aVand began muttering.
p274
aV'Head explosions and people trying to kill.
p275
aVIs it okay if I totally trash your office?'
p276
aV'You need to leave if you think you're going to do that,'
p277
aVsaid Marder.
p278
aV'Okay. Small. Fire on ice. Tell them not to kill me.
p279
aVTell them not to kill me. What have I done wrong?
p280
aVHundreds of thousands with thoughts, interdiction.'
p281
aV'Elyn, do you feel like you're
p282
aVdangerous to yourself or others?
p283
aVI think you need to be in the hospital.
p284
aVI could get you admitted right away, and the whole thing
p285
aVcould be very discrete.'
p286
aV'Ha, ha, ha.
p287
aVYou're offering to put me in hospitals?
p288
aVHospitals are bad, they're mad, they're sad.
p289
aVOne must stay away. I'm God, or I used to be.'"
p290
aVAt that point in the text,
p291
aVwhere I said "I'm God, or I used to be," my husband
p292
aVmade a marginal note.
p293
aVHe said, "Did you quit or were you fired?"
p294
aV(Laughter)
p295
aV"'I give life and I take it away.
p296
aVForgive me, for I know not what I do.'
p297
aa(lp298
VEventually, I broke down in front of friends, and
p299
aVeverybody convinced me to take more medication.
p300
aVI could no longer deny the truth,
p301
aVand I could not change it.
p302
aVThe wall that kept me, Elyn, Professor Saks,
p303
aVseparate from that insane woman hospitalized years past,
p304
aVlay smashed and in ruins."
p305
aa(lp306
VEverything about this illness says I shouldn't be here,
p307
aVbut I am. And I am, I think, for three reasons:
p308
aVFirst, I've had excellent treatment.
p309
aVFour- to five-day-a-week psychoanalytic psychotherapy
p310
aVfor decades and continuing, and excellent psychopharmacology.
p311
aVSecond, I have many close family members and friends who know me
p312
aVand know my illness.
p313
aVThese relationships have given my life a meaning
p314
aVand a depth, and they also helped me navigate
p315
aVmy life in the face of symptoms.
p316
aVThird, I work at an enormously supportive workplace
p317
aVat USC Law School.
p318
aVThis is a place that not only accommodates my needs
p319
aVbut actually embraces them.
p320
aVIt's also a very intellectually stimulating place,
p321
aVand occupying my mind with complex problems
p322
aVhas been my best and most powerful and most reliable
p323
aVdefense against my mental illness.
p324
aa(lp325
VEven with all that \u2014 excellent treatment, wonderful family and
p326
aVfriends, supportive work environment \u2014
p327
aVI did not make my illness public
p328
aVuntil relatively late in life,
p329
aVand that's because the stigma against mental illness
p330
aVis so powerful that I didn't feel safe with people knowing.
p331
aVIf you hear nothing else today,
p332
aVplease hear this: There are not "schizophrenics."
p333
aVThere are people with schizophrenia, and these people
p334
aVmay be your spouse, they may be your child,
p335
aVthey may be your neighbor, they may be your friend,
p336
aVthey may be your coworker.
p337
aa(lp338
VSo let me share some final thoughts.
p339
aVWe need to invest more resources into research and treatment
p340
aVof mental illness.
p341
aVThe better we understand these illnesses, the better
p342
aVthe treatments we can provide, and the better the treatments
p343
aVwe can provide, the more we can offer people care,
p344
aVand not have to use force.
p345
aVAlso, we must stop criminalizing mental illness.
p346
aVIt's a national tragedy and scandal that the L.A. County Jail
p347
aVis the biggest psychiatric facility in the United States.
p348
aVAmerican prisons and jails are filled with people who suffer
p349
aVfrom severe mental illness, and many of them are there
p350
aVbecause they never received adequate treatment.
p351
aVI could have easily ended up there or on the streets myself.
p352
aVA message to the entertainment industry and to the press:
p353
aVOn the whole, you've done a wonderful job fighting stigma
p354
aVand prejudice of many kinds.
p355
aVPlease, continue to let us see characters in your movies,
p356
aVyour plays, your columns,
p357
aVwho suffer with severe mental illness.
p358
aVPortray them sympathetically,
p359
aVand portray them in all the richness and depth
p360
aVof their experience as people and not as diagnoses.
p361
aa(lp362
VRecently, a friend posed a question:
p363
aVIf there were a pill I could take
p364
aVthat would instantly cure me, would I take it?
p365
aVThe poet Rainer Maria Rilke
p366
aVwas offered psychoanalysis.
p367
aVHe declined, saying, "Don't take my devils away,
p368
aVbecause my angels may flee too."
p369
aVMy psychosis, on the other hand,
p370
aVis a waking nightmare in which my devils are so terrifying
p371
aVthat all my angels have already fled.
p372
aVSo would I take the pill? In an instant.
p373
aVThat said, I don't wish to be seen as regretting
p374
aVthe life I could have had if I'd not been mentally ill,
p375
aVnor am I asking anyone for their pity.
p376
aVWhat I rather wish to say is that the humanity we all share
p377
aVis more important than the mental illness we may not.
p378
aVWhat those of us who suffer with mental illness want
p379
aVis what everybody wants:
p380
aVin the words of Sigmund Freud, "to work and to love."
p381
aa(lp382
VThank you. (Applause)
p383
aa(lp384
V(Applause)
p385
aa(lp386
VThank you. Thank you. You're very kind. (Applause)
p387
aa(lp388
VThank you. (Applause)
