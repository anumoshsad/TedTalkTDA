VVirtual reality started for me in sort of an unusual place.
p4
aVIt was the 1970s.
p5
aVI got into the field very young: I was seven years old.
p6
aVAnd the tool that I used  to access virtual reality
p7
aVwas the Evel Knievel stunt cycle.
p8
aVThis is a commercial for  that particular item:
p9
aV(Video) Voice-over: What a jump!
p10
aVEvel's riding the amazing stunt cycle.
p11
aVThat gyro-power sends him  over 100 feet at top speed.
p12
aa(lp13
VChris Milk: So this was my joy back then.
p14
aVI rode this motorcycle everywhere.
p15
aVAnd I was there with Evel Knievel; we  jumped the Snake River Canyon together.
p16
aVI wanted the rocket.
p17
aVI never got the rocket, I only got the motorcycle.
p18
aVI felt so connected to this world.
p19
aVI didn't want to be a storyteller  when I grew up, I wanted to be stuntman.
p20
aVI was there. Evel Knievel was my friend.
p21
aVI had so much empathy for him.
p22
aa(lp23
VBut it didn't work out. (Laughter)
p24
aVI went to art school.
p25
aVI started making music videos.
p26
aVAnd this is one of the early music videos that I made:
p27
aV(Music: "Touch the Sky" by Kanye West)
p28
aVCM: You may notice  some slight similarities here.
p29
aV(Laughter)
p30
aVAnd I got that rocket.
p31
aV(Laughter)
p32
aa(lp33
VSo, now I'm a filmmaker, or, the beginning of a filmmaker,
p34
aVand I started using the tools that are available to me as a filmmaker
p35
aVto try to tell the most compelling stories that I can to an audience.
p36
aVAnd film is this incredible medium that allows us to feel empathy
p37
aVfor people that are very different than us
p38
aVand worlds completely  foreign from our own.
p39
aa(lp40
VUnfortunately,
p41
aVEvel Knievel did not feel the same  empathy for us that we felt for him,
p42
aVand he sued us for this video \u2014
p43
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p44
aVshortly thereafter.
p45
aVOn the upside, the man  that I worshipped as a child,
p46
aVthe man that I wanted  to become as an adult,
p47
aVI was finally able to get his autograph.
p48
aV(Applause)
p49
aa(lp50
VLet's talk about film now.
p51
aVFilm, it's an incredible medium,
p52
aVbut essentially, it's the same now as it was then.
p53
aVIt's a group of rectangles that are played in a sequence.
p54
aVAnd we've done incredible things with those rectangles.
p55
aVBut I started thinking about,
p56
aVis there a way that I can use modern and developing technologies
p57
aVto tell stories in different ways
p58
aVand tell different kinds of stories
p59
aVthat maybe I couldn't tell using the traditional tools of filmmaking
p60
aVthat we've been using for 100 years?
p61
aVSo I started experimenting,
p62
aVand what I was trying to do was to build the ultimate empathy machine.
p63
aVAnd here's one of the early experiments:
p64
aV(Music)
p65
aa(lp66
VSo this is called "The Wilderness Downtown."
p67
aVIt was a collaboration with Arcade Fire.
p68
aVIt asked you to put in the address where you grew up at the beginning of it.
p69
aVIt's a website.
p70
aVAnd out of it starts growing these little boxes with different browser windows.
p71
aVAnd you see this teenager  running down a street,
p72
aVand then you see Google Street View and Google Maps imagery
p73
aVand you realize the street he's running down is yours.
p74
aVAnd when he stops in front of a house, he stops in front of your house.
p75
aVAnd this was great, and I saw people  having an even deeper emotional reaction
p76
aVto this than the things that  I had made in rectangles.
p77
aVAnd I'm essentially taking  a piece of your history
p78
aVand putting it inside  the framing of the story.
p79
aa(lp80
VBut then I started thinking,
p81
aVokay, well that's a part of you,
p82
aVbut how do I put all of you inside of the frame?
p83
aVSo to do that, I started making art installations.
p84
aVAnd this is one called  "The Treachery of Sanctuary."
p85
aVIt's a triptych. I'm going to show you the third panel.
p86
aV(Music)
p87
aVSo now I've got you inside of the frame,
p88
aVand I saw people having even more visceral emotional reactions
p89
aVto this work than the previous one.
p90
aa(lp91
VBut then I started thinking about frames, and what do they represent?
p92
aVAnd a frame is just a window.
p93
aVI mean, all the media that we watch \u2014 television, cinema \u2014
p94
aVthey're these windows into  these other worlds.
p95
aVAnd I thought, well, great.  I got you in a frame.
p96
aVBut I don't want you in the frame, I don't want you in the window,
p97
aVI want you through the window, I want you on the other side,
p98
aVin the world, inhabiting the world.
p99
aa(lp100
VSo that leads me back to virtual reality.
p101
aVLet's talk about virtual reality.
p102
aVUnfortunately,
p103
aVtalking about virtual reality is like dancing about architecture.
p104
aVAnd this is actually someone dancing about architecture in virtual reality.
p105
aV(Laughter)
p106
aVSo, it's difficult to explain. Why is it difficult to explain?
p107
aVIt's difficult because it's a very  experiential medium.
p108
aVYou feel your way inside of it.
p109
aVIt's a machine, but inside of it,
p110
aVit feels like real life, it feels like truth.
p111
aVAnd you feel present in the world that you're inside
p112
aVand you feel present with the people that you're inside of it with.
p113
aa(lp114
VSo, I'm going to show you a demo of a virtual reality film:
p115
aVa full-screen version of all the information
p116
aVthat we capture when we shoot virtual reality.
p117
aVSo we're shooting in every direction.
p118
aVThis is a camera system that we built
p119
aVthat has 3D cameras that look in every direction
p120
aVand binaural microphones that face in every direction.
p121
aVWe take this and we build, basically, a sphere of a world that you inhabit.
p122
aVSo what I'm going to show you is not a view into the world,
p123
aVit's basically the whole world stretched into a rectangle.
p124
aVSo this film is called  "Clouds Over Sidra,"
p125
aVand it was made in conjunction with  our virtual reality company called VRSE
p126
aVand the United Nations,
p127
aVand a co-collaborator named Gabo Arora.
p128
aVAnd we went to a Syrian refugee camp in Jordan in December
p129
aVand shot the story of a 12-year-old girl there named Sidra.
p130
aVAnd she and her family fled Syria through the desert into Jordan
p131
aVand she's been living in this camp for the last year and a half.
p132
aa(lp133
V(Video) Sidra: My name is Sidra.
p134
aVI am 12 years old.
p135
aVI am in the fifth grade.
p136
aVI am from Syria, in the Daraa Province, Inkhil City.
p137
aVI have lived here in the Zaatari camp in Jordan for the last year and a half.
p138
aVI have a big family:
p139
aVthree brothers, one is a baby.
p140
aVHe cries a lot.
p141
aVI asked my father if I cried when  I was a baby and he says I did not.
p142
aVI think I was a stronger baby than my brother.
p143
aa(lp144
VCM: So, when you're inside  of the headset.
p145
aVyou're not seeing it like this.
p146
aVYou're looking around through this world.
p147
aVYou'll notice you see full 360 degrees, in all directions.
p148
aVAnd when you're sitting there in her room, watching her,
p149
aVyou're not watching it through a television screen,
p150
aVyou're not watching it through a window, you're sitting there with her.
p151
aVWhen you look down, you're sitting on the same ground that she's sitting on.
p152
aVAnd because of that,
p153
aVyou feel her humanity in a deeper way.
p154
aVYou empathize with her in a deeper way.
p155
aa(lp156
VAnd I think that we can change minds with this machine.
p157
aVAnd we've already started to try to change a few.
p158
aVSo we took this film to the World Economic Forum in Davos in January.
p159
aVAnd we showed it to a group of people
p160
aVwhose decisions affect the lives of millions of people.
p161
aVAnd these are people  who might not otherwise
p162
aVbe sitting in a tent  in a refugee camp in Jordan.
p163
aVBut in January, one afternoon in Switzerland,
p164
aVthey suddenly all found themselves there.
p165
aV(Applause)
p166
aVAnd they were affected by it.
p167
aa(lp168
VSo we're going to make more of them.
p169
aVWe're working with the  United Nations right now
p170
aVto shoot a whole series of these films.
p171
aVWe just finished shooting a story in Liberia.
p172
aVAnd now, we're going  to shoot a story in India.
p173
aVAnd we're taking these films,
p174
aVand we're showing them  at the United Nations
p175
aVto people that work there and people that are visiting there.
p176
aVAnd we're showing  them to the people
p177
aVthat can actually change the lives of the people inside of the films.
p178
aa(lp179
VAnd that's where I think we just start to scratch the surface
p180
aVof the true power of virtual reality.
p181
aVIt's not a video game peripheral.
p182
aVIt connects humans to other humans in a profound way
p183
aVthat I've never seen before  in any other form of media.
p184
aVAnd it can change people's perception of each other.
p185
aVAnd that's how I think
p186
aVvirtual reality has the potential to actually change the world.
p187
aa(lp188
VSo, it's a machine,
p189
aVbut through this machine we become more compassionate,
p190
aVwe become more empathetic, and we become more connected.
p191
aVAnd ultimately, we become more human.
p192
aa(lp193
VThank you.
