VSo I have bad news, I have good news,
p4
aVand I have a task.
p5
aVSo the bad news is that we all get sick.
p6
aVI get sick. You get sick.
p7
aVAnd every one of us gets sick, and the question really is,
p8
aVhow sick do we get? Is it something that kills us?
p9
aVIs it something that we survive?
p10
aVIs it something that we can treat?
p11
aa(lp12
VAnd we've gotten sick as long as we've been people.
p13
aVAnd so we've always looked for reasons to explain why we get sick.
p14
aVAnd for a long time, it was the gods, right?
p15
aVThe gods are angry with me, or the gods are testing me,
p16
aVright? Or God, singular, more recently,
p17
aVis punishing me or judging me.
p18
aVAnd as long as we've looked for explanations,
p19
aVwe've wound up with something that gets closer and closer to science,
p20
aVwhich is hypotheses as to why we get sick,
p21
aVand as long as we've had hypotheses about why we get sick, we've tried to treat it as well.
p22
aa(lp23
VSo this is Avicenna. He wrote a book over a thousand years ago called "The Canon of Medicine,"
p24
aVand the rules he laid out for testing medicines
p25
aVare actually really similar to the rules we have today,
p26
aVthat the disease and the medicine must be the same strength,
p27
aVthe medicine needs to be pure, and in the end we need
p28
aVto test it in people. And so if you put together these themes
p29
aVof a narrative or a hypothesis in human testing,
p30
aVright, you get some beautiful results,
p31
aVeven when we didn't have very good technologies.
p32
aa(lp33
VThis is a guy named Carlos Finlay. He had a hypothesis
p34
aVthat was way outside the box for his time, in the late 1800s.
p35
aVHe thought yellow fever was not transmitted by dirty clothing.
p36
aVHe thought it was transmitted by mosquitos.
p37
aVAnd they laughed at him. For 20 years, they called this guy
p38
aV"the mosquito man." But he ran an experiment in people,
p39
aVright? He had this hypothesis, and he tested it in people.
p40
aVSo he got volunteers to go move to Cuba and live in tents
p41
aVand be voluntarily infected with yellow fever.
p42
aVSo some of the people in some of the tents had dirty clothes
p43
aVand some of the people were in tents that were full
p44
aVof mosquitos that had been exposed to yellow fever.
p45
aVAnd it definitively proved that it wasn't this magic dust
p46
aVcalled fomites in your clothes that caused yellow fever.
p47
aVBut it wasn't until we tested it in people that we actually knew.
p48
aVAnd this is what those people signed up for.
p49
aVThis is what it looked like to have yellow fever in Cuba
p50
aVat that time. You suffered in a tent, in the heat, alone,
p51
aVand you probably died.
p52
aVBut people volunteered for this.
p53
aa(lp54
VAnd it's not just a cool example of a scientific design
p55
aVof experiment in theory. They also did this beautiful thing.
p56
aVThey signed this document, and it's called an informed consent document.
p57
aVAnd informed consent is an idea that we should be
p58
aVvery proud of as a society, right? It's something that
p59
aVseparates us from the Nazis at Nuremberg,
p60
aVenforced medical experimentation. It's the idea
p61
aVthat agreement to join a study without understanding isn't agreement.
p62
aVIt's something that protects us from harm, from hucksters,
p63
aVfrom people that would try to hoodwink us into a clinical
p64
aVstudy that we don't understand, or that we don't agree to.
p65
aVAnd so you put together the thread of narrative hypothesis,
p66
aVexperimentation in humans, and informed consent,
p67
aVand you get what we call clinical study, and it's how we do
p68
aVthe vast majority of medical work. It doesn't really matter
p69
aVif you're in the north, the south, the east, the west.
p70
aVClinical studies form the basis of how we investigate,
p71
aVso if we're going to look at a new drug, right,
p72
aVwe test it in people, we draw blood, we do experiments,
p73
aVand we gain consent for that study, to make sure
p74
aVthat we're not screwing people over as part of it.
p75
aa(lp76
VBut the world is changing around the clinical study,
p77
aVwhich has been fairly well established for tens of years
p78
aVif not 50 to 100 years.
p79
aVSo now we're able to gather data about our genomes,
p80
aVbut, as we saw earlier, our genomes aren't dispositive.
p81
aVWe're able to gather information about our environment.
p82
aVAnd more importantly, we're able to gather information
p83
aVabout our choices, because it turns out that what we think of
p84
aVas our health is more like the interaction of our bodies,
p85
aVour genomes, our choices and our environment.
p86
aVAnd the clinical methods that we've got aren't very good
p87
aVat studying that because they are based on the idea
p88
aVof person-to-person interaction. You interact
p89
aVwith your doctor and you get enrolled in the study.
p90
aVSo this is my grandfather. I actually never met him,
p91
aVbut he's holding my mom, and his genes are in me, right?
p92
aVHis choices ran through to me. He was a smoker,
p93
aVlike most people were. This is my son.
p94
aVSo my grandfather's genes go all the way through to him,
p95
aVand my choices are going to affect his health.
p96
aVThe technology between these two pictures
p97
aVcannot be more different, but the methodology
p98
aVfor clinical studies has not radically changed over that time period.
p99
aVWe just have better statistics.
p100
aVThe way we gain informed consent was formed in large part
p101
aVafter World War II, around the time that picture was taken.
p102
aVThat was 70 years ago, and the way we gain informed consent,
p103
aVthis tool that was created to protect us from harm,
p104
aVnow creates silos. So the data that we collect
p105
aVfor prostate cancer or for Alzheimer's trials
p106
aVgoes into silos where it can only be used
p107
aVfor prostate cancer or for Alzheimer's research.
p108
aVRight? It can't be networked. It can't be integrated.
p109
aVIt cannot be used by people who aren't credentialed.
p110
aVSo a physicist can't get access to it without filing paperwork.
p111
aVA computer scientist can't get access to it without filing paperwork.
p112
aVComputer scientists aren't patient. They don't file paperwork.
p113
aa(lp114
VAnd this is an accident. These are tools that we created
p115
aVto protect us from harm, but what they're doing
p116
aVis protecting us from innovation now.
p117
aVAnd that wasn't the goal. It wasn't the point. Right?
p118
aVIt's a side effect, if you will, of a power we created
p119
aVto take us for good.
p120
aVAnd so if you think about it, the depressing thing is that
p121
aVFacebook would never make a change to something
p122
aVas important as an advertising algorithm
p123
aVwith a sample size as small as a Phase III clinical trial.
p124
aVWe cannot take the information from past trials
p125
aVand put them together to form statistically significant samples.
p126
aa(lp127
VAnd that sucks, right? So 45 percent of men develop
p128
aVcancer. Thirty-eight percent of women develop cancer.
p129
aVOne in four men dies of cancer.
p130
aVOne in five women dies of cancer, at least in the United States.
p131
aVAnd three out of the four drugs we give you
p132
aVif you get cancer fail. And this is personal to me.
p133
aVMy sister is a cancer survivor.
p134
aVMy mother-in-law is a cancer survivor. Cancer sucks.
p135
aVAnd when you have it, you don't have a lot of privacy
p136
aVin the hospital. You're naked the vast majority of the time.
p137
aVPeople you don't know come in and look at you and poke you and prod you,
p138
aVand when I tell cancer survivors that this tool we created
p139
aVto protect them is actually preventing their data from being used,
p140
aVespecially when only three to four percent of people
p141
aVwho have cancer ever even sign up for a clinical study,
p142
aVtheir reaction is not, "Thank you, God, for protecting my privacy."
p143
aVIt's outrage
p144
aVthat we have this information and we can't use it.
p145
aVAnd it's an accident.
p146
aVSo the cost in blood and treasure of this is enormous.
p147
aVTwo hundred and twenty-six billion a year is spent on cancer in the United States.
p148
aVFifteen hundred people a day die in the United States.
p149
aVAnd it's getting worse.
p150
aa(lp151
VSo the good news is that some things have changed,
p152
aVand the most important thing that's changed
p153
aVis that we can now measure ourselves in ways
p154
aVthat used to be the dominion of the health system.
p155
aVSo a lot of people talk about it as digital exhaust.
p156
aVI like to think of it as the dust that runs along behind my kid.
p157
aVWe can reach back and grab that dust,
p158
aVand we can learn a lot about health from it, so if our choices
p159
aVare part of our health, what we eat is a really important
p160
aVaspect of our health. So you can do something very simple
p161
aVand basic and take a picture of your food,
p162
aVand if enough people do that, we can learn a lot about
p163
aVhow our food affects our health.
p164
aVOne interesting thing that came out of this \u2014 this is an app for iPhones called The Eatery \u2014
p165
aVis that we think our pizza is significantly healthier
p166
aVthan other people's pizza is. Okay? (Laughter)
p167
aVAnd it seems like a trivial result, but this is the sort of research
p168
aVthat used to take the health system years
p169
aVand hundreds of thousands of dollars to accomplish.
p170
aVIt was done in five months by a startup company of a couple of people.
p171
aVI don't have any financial interest in it.
p172
aa(lp173
VBut more nontrivially, we can get our genotypes done,
p174
aVand although our genotypes aren't dispositive, they give us clues.
p175
aVSo I could show you mine. It's just A's, T's, C's and G's.
p176
aVThis is the interpretation of it. As you can see,
p177
aVI carry a 32 percent risk of prostate cancer,
p178
aV22 percent risk of psoriasis and a 14 percent risk of Alzheimer's disease.
p179
aVSo that means, if you're a geneticist, you're freaking out,
p180
aVgoing, "Oh my God, you told everyone you carry the ApoE E4 allele. What's wrong with you?"
p181
aVRight? When I got these results, I started talking to doctors,
p182
aVand they told me not to tell anyone, and my reaction is,
p183
aV"Is that going to help anyone cure me when I get the disease?"
p184
aVAnd no one could tell me yes.
p185
aVAnd I live in a web world where, when you share things,
p186
aVbeautiful stuff happens, not bad stuff.
p187
aVSo I started putting this in my slide decks,
p188
aVand I got even more obnoxious, and I went to my doctor,
p189
aVand I said, "I'd like to actually get my bloodwork.
p190
aVPlease give me back my data." So this is my most recent bloodwork.
p191
aVAs you can see, I have high cholesterol.
p192
aVI have particularly high bad cholesterol, and I have some
p193
aVbad liver numbers, but those are because we had a dinner party with a lot of good wine
p194
aVthe night before we ran the test. (Laughter)
p195
aVRight. But look at how non-computable this information is.
p196
aVThis is like the photograph of my granddad holding my mom
p197
aVfrom a data perspective, and I had to go into the system
p198
aVand get it out.
p199
aa(lp200
VSo the thing that I'm proposing we do here
p201
aVis that we reach behind us and we grab the dust,
p202
aVthat we reach into our bodies and we grab the genotype,
p203
aVand we reach into the medical system and we grab our records,
p204
aVand we use it to build something together, which is a commons.
p205
aVAnd there's been a lot of talk about commonses, right,
p206
aVhere, there, everywhere, right. A commons is nothing more
p207
aVthan a public good that we build out of private goods.
p208
aVWe do it voluntarily, and we do it through standardized
p209
aVlegal tools. We do it through standardized technologies.
p210
aVRight. That's all a commons is. It's something that we build
p211
aVtogether because we think it's important.
p212
aa(lp213
VAnd a commons of data is something that's really unique,
p214
aVbecause we make it from our own data. And although
p215
aVa lot of people like privacy as their methodology of control
p216
aVaround data, and obsess around privacy, at least
p217
aVsome of us really like to share as a form of control,
p218
aVand what's remarkable about digital commonses
p219
aVis you don't need a big percentage if your sample size is big enough
p220
aVto generate something massive and beautiful.
p221
aVSo not that many programmers write free software,
p222
aVbut we have the Apache web server.
p223
aVNot that many people who read Wikipedia edit,
p224
aVbut it works. So as long as some people like to share
p225
aVas their form of control, we can build a commons, as long as we can get the information out.
p226
aVAnd in biology, the numbers are even better.
p227
aVSo Vanderbilt ran a study asking people, we'd like to take
p228
aVyour biosamples, your blood, and share them in a biobank,
p229
aVand only five percent of the people opted out.
p230
aVI'm from Tennessee. It's not the most science-positive state
p231
aVin the United States of America. (Laughter)
p232
aVBut only five percent of the people wanted out.
p233
aVSo people like to share, if you give them the opportunity and the choice.
p234
aa(lp235
VAnd the reason that I got obsessed with this, besides the obvious family aspects,
p236
aVis that I spend a lot of time around mathematicians,
p237
aVand mathematicians are drawn to places where there's a lot of data
p238
aVbecause they can use it to tease signals out of noise.
p239
aVAnd those correlations that they can tease out, they're not
p240
aVnecessarily causal agents, but math, in this day and age,
p241
aVis like a giant set of power tools
p242
aVthat we're leaving on the floor, not plugged in in health,
p243
aVwhile we use hand saws.
p244
aVIf we have a lot of shared genotypes, and a lot of shared
p245
aVoutcomes, and a lot of shared lifestyle choices,
p246
aVand a lot of shared environmental information, we can start
p247
aVto tease out the correlations between subtle variations
p248
aVin people, the choices they make and the health that they create as a result of those choices,
p249
aVand there's open-source infrastructure to do all of this.
p250
aVSage Bionetworks is a nonprofit that's built a giant math system
p251
aVthat's waiting for data, but there isn't any.
p252
aa(lp253
VSo that's what I do. I've actually started what we think is
p254
aVthe world's first fully digital, fully self-contributed,
p255
aVunlimited in scope, global in participation, ethically approved
p256
aVclinical research study where you contribute the data.
p257
aVSo if you reach behind yourself and you grab the dust,
p258
aVif you reach into your body and grab your genome,
p259
aVif you reach into the medical system and somehow extract your medical record,
p260
aVyou can actually go through an online informed consent process \u2014
p261
aVbecause the donation to the commons must be voluntary
p262
aVand it must be informed \u2014 and you can actually upload
p263
aVyour information and have it syndicated to the
p264
aVmathematicians who will do this sort of big data research,
p265
aVand the goal is to get 100,000 in the first year
p266
aVand a million in the first five years so that we have
p267
aVa statistically significant cohort that you can use to take
p268
aVsmaller sample sizes from traditional research
p269
aVand map it against,
p270
aVso that you can use it to tease out those subtle correlations
p271
aVbetween the variations that make us unique
p272
aVand the kinds of health that we need to move forward as a society.
p273
aa(lp274
VAnd I've spent a lot of time around other commons.
p275
aVI've been around the early web. I've been around
p276
aVthe early creative commons world, and there's four things
p277
aVthat all of these share, which is, they're all really simple.
p278
aVAnd so if you were to go to the website and enroll in this study,
p279
aVyou're not going to see something complicated.
p280
aVBut it's not simplistic. These things are weak intentionally,
p281
aVright, because you can always add power and control to a system,
p282
aVbut it's very difficult to remove those things if you put them in at the beginning,
p283
aVand so being simple doesn't mean being simplistic,
p284
aVand being weak doesn't mean weakness.
p285
aVThose are strengths in the system.
p286
aa(lp287
VAnd open doesn't mean that there's no money.
p288
aVClosed systems, corporations, make a lot of money
p289
aVon the open web, and they're one of the reasons why the open web lives
p290
aVis that corporations have a vested interest in the openness
p291
aVof the system.
p292
aVAnd so all of these things are part of the clinical study that we've created,
p293
aVso you can actually come in, all you have to be is 14 years old,
p294
aVwilling to sign a contract that says I'm not going to be a jerk,
p295
aVbasically, and you're in.
p296
aVYou can start analyzing the data.
p297
aVYou do have to solve a CAPTCHA as well. (Laughter)
p298
aVAnd if you'd like to build corporate structures on top of it,
p299
aVthat's okay too. That's all in the consent,
p300
aVso if you don't like those terms, you don't come in.
p301
aVIt's very much the design principles of a commons
p302
aVthat we're trying to bring to health data.
p303
aVAnd the other thing about these systems is that it only takes
p304
aVa small number of really unreasonable people working together
p305
aVto create them. It didn't take that many people
p306
aVto make Wikipedia Wikipedia, or to keep it Wikipedia.
p307
aVAnd we're not supposed to be unreasonable in health,
p308
aVand so I hate this word "patient."
p309
aVI don't like being patient when systems are broken,
p310
aVand health care is broken.
p311
aVI'm not talking about the politics of health care, I'm talking about the way we scientifically approach health care.
p312
aVSo I don't want to be patient. And the task I'm giving to you
p313
aVis to not be patient. So I'd like you to actually try,
p314
aVwhen you go home, to get your data.
p315
aVYou'll be shocked and offended and, I would bet, outraged,
p316
aVat how hard it is to get it.
p317
aVBut it's a challenge that I hope you'll take,
p318
aVand maybe you'll share it. Maybe you won't.
p319
aVIf you don't have anyone in your family who's sick,
p320
aVmaybe you wouldn't be unreasonable. But if you do,
p321
aVor if you've been sick, then maybe you would.
p322
aVAnd we're going to be able to do an experiment in the next several months
p323
aVthat lets us know exactly how many unreasonable people are out there.
p324
aVSo this is the Athena Breast Health Network. It's a study
p325
aVof 150,000 women in California, and they're going to
p326
aVreturn all the data to the participants of the study
p327
aVin a computable form, with one-clickability to load it into
p328
aVthe study that I've put together. So we'll know exactly
p329
aVhow many people are willing to be unreasonable.
p330
aa(lp331
VSo what I'd end [with] is,
p332
aVthe most beautiful thing I've learned since I quit my job
p333
aValmost a year ago to do this, is that it really doesn't take
p334
aVvery many of us to achieve spectacular results.
p335
aVYou just have to be willing to be unreasonable,
p336
aVand the risk we're running is not the risk those 14 men
p337
aVwho got yellow fever ran. Right?
p338
aVIt's to be naked, digitally, in public. So you know more
p339
aVabout me and my health than I know about you. It's asymmetric now.
p340
aVAnd being naked and alone can be terrifying.
p341
aVBut to be naked in a group, voluntarily, can be quite beautiful.
p342
aVAnd so it doesn't take all of us.
p343
aVIt just takes all of some of us. Thank you.
