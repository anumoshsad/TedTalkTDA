VThe things we make
p4
aVhave one supreme quality \u2014
p5
aVthey live longer than us.
p6
aVWe perish, they survive;
p7
aVwe have one life, they have many lives,
p8
aVand in each life they can mean different things.
p9
aVWhich means that, while we all have one biography,
p10
aVthey have many.
p11
aa(lp12
VI want this morning to talk
p13
aVabout the story, the biography \u2014 or rather the biographies \u2014
p14
aVof one particular object,
p15
aVone remarkable thing.
p16
aVIt doesn't, I agree,
p17
aVlook very much.
p18
aVIt's about the size of a rugby ball.
p19
aVIt's made of clay,
p20
aVand it's been fashioned
p21
aVinto a cylinder shape,
p22
aVcovered with close writing
p23
aVand then baked dry in the sun.
p24
aVAnd as you can see,
p25
aVit's been knocked about a bit,
p26
aVwhich is not surprising
p27
aVbecause it was made two and a half thousand years ago
p28
aVand was dug up
p29
aVin 1879.
p30
aVBut today,
p31
aVthis thing is, I believe,
p32
aVa major player
p33
aVin the politics of the Middle East.
p34
aVAnd it's an object
p35
aVwith fascinating stories
p36
aVand stories that are by no means over yet.
p37
aa(lp38
VThe story begins
p39
aVin the Iran-Iraq war
p40
aVand that series of events
p41
aVthat culminated
p42
aVin the invasion of Iraq
p43
aVby foreign forces,
p44
aVthe removal of a despotic ruler
p45
aVand instant regime change.
p46
aVAnd I want to begin
p47
aVwith one episode from that sequence of events
p48
aVthat most of you would be very familiar with,
p49
aVBelshazzar's feast \u2014
p50
aVbecause we're talking about the Iran-Iraq war
p51
aVof 539 BC.
p52
aVAnd the parallels
p53
aVbetween the events
p54
aVof 539 BC and 2003 and in between
p55
aVare startling.
p56
aVWhat you're looking at is Rembrandt's painting,
p57
aVnow in the National Gallery in London,
p58
aVillustrating the text from the prophet Daniel
p59
aVin the Hebrew scriptures.
p60
aVAnd you all know roughly the story.
p61
aa(lp62
VBelshazzar, the son of Nebuchadnezzar,
p63
aVNebuchadnezzar who'd conquered Israel, sacked Jerusalem
p64
aVand captured the people
p65
aVand taken the Jews back to Babylon.
p66
aVNot only the Jews, he'd taken the temple vessels.
p67
aVHe'd ransacked, desecrated the temple.
p68
aVAnd the great gold vessels of the temple in Jerusalem
p69
aVhad been taken to Babylon.
p70
aVBelshazzar, his son,
p71
aVdecides to have a feast.
p72
aVAnd in order to make it even more exciting,
p73
aVhe added a bit of sacrilege to the rest of the fun,
p74
aVand he brings out the temple vessels.
p75
aVHe's already at war with the Iranians,
p76
aVwith the king of Persia.
p77
aa(lp78
VAnd that night, Daniel tells us,
p79
aVat the height of the festivities
p80
aVa hand appeared and wrote on the wall,
p81
aV"You are weighed in the balance and found wanting,
p82
aVand your kingdom is handed over
p83
aVto the Medes and the Persians."
p84
aVAnd that very night
p85
aVCyrus, king of the Persians, entered Babylon
p86
aVand the whole regime of Belshazzar fell.
p87
aVIt is, of course, a great moment
p88
aVin the history
p89
aVof the Jewish people.
p90
aVIt's a great story. It's story we all know.
p91
aV"The writing on the wall"
p92
aVis part of our everyday language.
p93
aVWhat happened next
p94
aVwas remarkable,
p95
aVand it's where our cylinder
p96
aVenters the story.
p97
aa(lp98
VCyrus, king of the Persians,
p99
aVhas entered Babylon without a fight \u2014
p100
aVthe great empire of Babylon,
p101
aVwhich ran from central southern Iraq
p102
aVto the Mediterranean,
p103
aVfalls to Cyrus.
p104
aVAnd Cyrus makes a declaration.
p105
aVAnd that is what this cylinder is,
p106
aVthe declaration made by the ruler guided by God
p107
aVwho had toppled the Iraqi despot
p108
aVand was going to bring freedom to the people.
p109
aVIn ringing Babylonian \u2014
p110
aVit was written in Babylonian \u2014
p111
aVhe says, "I am Cyrus, king of all the universe,
p112
aVthe great king, the powerful king,
p113
aVking of Babylon, king of the four quarters of the world."
p114
aVThey're not shy of hyperbole as you can see.
p115
aVThis is probably
p116
aVthe first real press release
p117
aVby a victorious army
p118
aVthat we've got.
p119
aVAnd it's written, as we'll see in due course,
p120
aVby very skilled P.R. consultants.
p121
aVSo the hyperbole is not actually surprising.
p122
aa(lp123
VAnd what is the great king, the powerful king,
p124
aVthe king of the four quarters of the world going to do?
p125
aVHe goes on to say that, having conquered Babylon,
p126
aVhe will at once let all the peoples
p127
aVthat the Babylonians \u2014 Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar \u2014
p128
aVhave captured and enslaved
p129
aVgo free.
p130
aVHe'll let them return to their countries.
p131
aVAnd more important,
p132
aVhe will let them all recover
p133
aVthe gods, the statues,
p134
aVthe temple vessels
p135
aVthat had been confiscated.
p136
aVAll the peoples that the Babylonians had repressed and removed
p137
aVwill go home,
p138
aVand they'll take with them their gods.
p139
aVAnd they'll be able to restore their altars
p140
aVand to worship their gods
p141
aVin their own way, in their own place.
p142
aVThis is the decree,
p143
aVthis object is the evidence
p144
aVfor the fact that the Jews,
p145
aVafter the exile in Babylon,
p146
aVthe years they'd spent sitting by the waters of Babylon,
p147
aVweeping when they remembered Jerusalem,
p148
aVthose Jews were allowed to go home.
p149
aVThey were allowed to return to Jerusalem
p150
aVand to rebuild the temple.
p151
aa(lp152
VIt's a central document
p153
aVin Jewish history.
p154
aVAnd the Book of Chronicles, the Book of Ezra in the Hebrew scriptures
p155
aVreported in ringing terms.
p156
aVThis is the Jewish version
p157
aVof the same story.
p158
aV"Thus said Cyrus, king of Persia,
p159
aV'All the kingdoms of the earth have the Lord God of heaven given thee,
p160
aVand he has charged me
p161
aVto build him a house in Jerusalem.
p162
aVWho is there among you of his people?
p163
aVThe Lord God be with him,
p164
aVand let him go up.'"
p165
aV"Go up" \u2014 aaleh.
p166
aVThe central element, still,
p167
aVof the notion of return,
p168
aVa central part
p169
aVof the life of Judaism.
p170
aVAs you all know, that return from exile,
p171
aVthe second temple,
p172
aVreshaped Judaism.
p173
aVAnd that change,
p174
aVthat great historic moment,
p175
aVwas made possible by Cyrus, the king of Persia,
p176
aVreported for us in Hebrew in scripture
p177
aVand in Babylonian in clay.
p178
aa(lp179
VTwo great texts,
p180
aVwhat about the politics?
p181
aVWhat was going on
p182
aVwas the fundamental shift in Middle Eastern history.
p183
aVThe empire of Iran, the Medes and the Persians,
p184
aVunited under Cyrus,
p185
aVbecame the first great world empire.
p186
aVCyrus begins in the 530s BC.
p187
aVAnd by the time of his son Darius,
p188
aVthe whole of the eastern Mediterranean
p189
aVis under Persian control.
p190
aVThis empire is, in fact,
p191
aVthe Middle East as we now know it,
p192
aVand it's what shapes the Middle East as we now know it.
p193
aVIt was the largest empire the world had known until then.
p194
aVMuch more important,
p195
aVit was the first
p196
aVmulticultural, multifaith state
p197
aVon a huge scale.
p198
aVAnd it had to be run in a quite new way.
p199
aVIt had to be run in different languages.
p200
aVThe fact that this decree is in Babylonian says one thing.
p201
aVAnd it had to recognize their different habits,
p202
aVdifferent peoples, different religions, different faiths.
p203
aVAll of those are respected by Cyrus.
p204
aa(lp205
VCyrus sets up a model
p206
aVof how you run
p207
aVa great multinational, multifaith, multicultural society.
p208
aVAnd the result of that
p209
aVwas an empire that included the areas you see on the screen,
p210
aVand which survived for 200 years of stability
p211
aVuntil it was shattered by Alexander.
p212
aVIt left a dream of the Middle East as a unit,
p213
aVand a unit where people of different faiths
p214
aVcould live together.
p215
aVThe Greek invasions ended that.
p216
aVAnd of course, Alexander couldn't sustain a government
p217
aVand it fragmented.
p218
aVBut what Cyrus represented
p219
aVremained absolutely central.
p220
aa(lp221
VThe Greek historian Xenophon
p222
aVwrote his book "Cyropaedia"
p223
aVpromoting Cyrus as the great ruler.
p224
aVAnd throughout European culture afterward,
p225
aVCyrus remained the model.
p226
aVThis is a 16th century image
p227
aVto show you how widespread
p228
aVhis veneration actually was.
p229
aVAnd Xenophon's book on Cyrus
p230
aVon how you ran a diverse society
p231
aVwas one of the great textbooks
p232
aVthat inspired the Founding Fathers
p233
aVof the American Revolution.
p234
aVJefferson was a great admirer \u2014
p235
aVthe ideals of Cyrus
p236
aVobviously speaking to those 18th century ideals
p237
aVof how you create religious tolerance
p238
aVin a new state.
p239
aa(lp240
VMeanwhile, back in Babylon,
p241
aVthings had not been going well.
p242
aVAfter Alexander, the other empires,
p243
aVBabylon declines, falls into ruins,
p244
aVand all the traces of the great Babylonian empire are lost \u2014
p245
aVuntil 1879
p246
aVwhen the cylinder is discovered
p247
aVby a British Museum exhibition digging in Babylon.
p248
aVAnd it enters now another story.
p249
aVIt enters that great debate
p250
aVin the middle of the 19th century:
p251
aVAre the scriptures reliable? Can we trust them?
p252
aVWe only knew
p253
aVabout the return of the Jews and the decree of Cyrus
p254
aVfrom the Hebrew scriptures.
p255
aVNo other evidence.
p256
aVSuddenly, this appeared.
p257
aVAnd great excitement
p258
aVto a world where those who believed in the scriptures
p259
aVhad had their faith in creation shaken
p260
aVby evolution, by geology,
p261
aVhere was evidence
p262
aVthat the scriptures were historically true.
p263
aVIt's a great 19th century moment.
p264
aa(lp265
VBut \u2014 and this, of course, is where it becomes complicated \u2014
p266
aVthe facts were true,
p267
aVhurrah for archeology,
p268
aVbut the interpretation was rather more complicated.
p269
aVBecause the cylinder account and the Hebrew Bible account
p270
aVdiffer in one key respect.
p271
aVThe Babylonian cylinder
p272
aVis written by the priests
p273
aVof the great god of Bablyon, Marduk.
p274
aVAnd, not surprisingly,
p275
aVthey tell you that all this was done by Marduk.
p276
aV"Marduk, we hold, called Cyrus by his name."
p277
aVMarduk takes Cyrus by the hand,
p278
aVcalls him to shepherd his people
p279
aVand gives him the rule of Babylon.
p280
aVMarduk tells Cyrus
p281
aVthat he will do these great, generous things
p282
aVof setting the people free.
p283
aVAnd this is why we should all be grateful to
p284
aVand worship Marduk.
p285
aa(lp286
VThe Hebrew writers
p287
aVin the Old Testament,
p288
aVyou will not be surprised to learn,
p289
aVtake a rather different view of this.
p290
aVFor them, of course, it can't possibly by Marduk
p291
aVthat made all this happen.
p292
aVIt can only be Jehovah.
p293
aVAnd so in Isaiah,
p294
aVwe have the wonderful texts
p295
aVgiving all the credit of this,
p296
aVnot to Marduk
p297
aVbut to the Lord God of Israel \u2014
p298
aVthe Lord God of Israel
p299
aVwho also called Cyrus by name,
p300
aValso takes Cyrus by the hand
p301
aVand talks of him shepherding his people.
p302
aVIt's a remarkable example
p303
aVof two different priestly appropriations of the same event,
p304
aVtwo different religious takeovers
p305
aVof a political fact.
p306
aa(lp307
VGod, we know,
p308
aVis usually on the side of the big battalions.
p309
aVThe question is, which god was it?
p310
aVAnd the debate unsettles
p311
aVeverybody in the 19th century
p312
aVto realize that the Hebrew scriptures
p313
aVare part of a much wider world of religion.
p314
aVAnd it's quite clear
p315
aVthe cylinder is older than the text of Isaiah,
p316
aVand yet, Jehovah is speaking
p317
aVin words very similar
p318
aVto those used by Marduk.
p319
aVAnd there's a slight sense that Isaiah knows this,
p320
aVbecause he says,
p321
aVthis is God speaking, of course,
p322
aV"I have called thee by thy name
p323
aVthough thou hast not known me."
p324
aVI think it's recognized
p325
aVthat Cyrus doesn't realize
p326
aVthat he's acting under orders from Jehovah.
p327
aVAnd equally, he'd have been surprised that he was acting under orders from Marduk.
p328
aVBecause interestingly, of course,
p329
aVCyrus is a good Iranian
p330
aVwith a totally different set of gods
p331
aVwho are not mentioned in any of these texts.
p332
aa(lp333
V(Laughter)
p334
aa(lp335
VThat's 1879.
p336
aV40 years on
p337
aVand we're in 1917,
p338
aVand the cylinder enters a different world.
p339
aVThis time, the real politics
p340
aVof the contemporary world \u2014
p341
aVthe year of the Balfour Declaration,
p342
aVthe year when the new imperial power in the Middle East, Britain,
p343
aVdecides that it will declare
p344
aVa Jewish national home,
p345
aVit will allow
p346
aVthe Jews to return.
p347
aVAnd the response to this
p348
aVby the Jewish population in Eastern Europe is rhapsodic.
p349
aVAnd across Eastern Europe,
p350
aVJews display pictures of Cyrus
p351
aVand of George V
p352
aVside by side \u2014
p353
aVthe two great rulers
p354
aVwho have allowed the return to Jerusalem.
p355
aVAnd the Cyrus cylinder comes back into public view
p356
aVand the text of this
p357
aVas a demonstration of why what is going to happen
p358
aVafter the war is over in 1918
p359
aVis part of a divine plan.
p360
aVYou all know what happened.
p361
aVThe state of Israel is setup,
p362
aVand 50 years later, in the late 60s,
p363
aVit's clear that Britain's role as the imperial power is over.
p364
aVAnd another story of the cylinder begins.
p365
aa(lp366
VThe region, the U.K. and the U.S. decide,
p367
aVhas to be kept safe from communism,
p368
aVand the superpower that will be created to do this
p369
aVwould be Iran, the Shah.
p370
aVAnd so the Shah invents an Iranian history,
p371
aVor a return to Iranian history,
p372
aVthat puts him in the center of a great tradition
p373
aVand produces coins
p374
aVshowing himself
p375
aVwith the Cyrus cylinder.
p376
aVWhen he has his great celebrations in Persepolis,
p377
aVhe summons the cylinder
p378
aVand the cylinder is lent by the British Museum, goes to Tehran,
p379
aVand is part of those great celebrations
p380
aVof the Pahlavi dynasty.
p381
aVCyrus cylinder: guarantor of the Shah.
p382
aa(lp383
V10 years later, another story:
p384
aVIranian Revolution, 1979.
p385
aVIslamic revolution, no more Cyrus;
p386
aVwe're not interested in that history,
p387
aVwe're interested in Islamic Iran \u2014
p388
aVuntil Iraq,
p389
aVthe new superpower that we've all decided should be in the region,
p390
aVattacks.
p391
aVThen another Iran-Iraq war.
p392
aVAnd it becomes critical for the Iranians
p393
aVto remember their great past,
p394
aVtheir great past
p395
aVwhen they fought Iraq and won.
p396
aVIt becomes critical to find a symbol
p397
aVthat will pull together all Iranians \u2014
p398
aVMuslims and non-Muslims,
p399
aVChristians, Zoroastrians, Jews living in Iran,
p400
aVpeople who are devout, not devout.
p401
aVAnd the obvious emblem is Cyrus.
p402
aa(lp403
VSo when the British Museum and Tehran National Musuem
p404
aVcooperate and work together, as we've been doing,
p405
aVthe Iranians ask for one thing only
p406
aVas a loan.
p407
aVIt's the only object they want.
p408
aVThey want to borrow the Cyrus cylinder.
p409
aVAnd last year,
p410
aVthe Cyrus cylinder went to Tehran
p411
aVfor the second time.
p412
aVIt's shown being presented here, put into its case
p413
aVby the director of the National Museum of Tehran,
p414
aVone of the many women in Iran in very senior positions,
p415
aVMrs. Ardakani.
p416
aVIt was a huge event.
p417
aVThis is the other side of that same picture.
p418
aVIt's seen in Tehran
p419
aVby between one and two million people
p420
aVin the space of a few months.
p421
aVThis is beyond any blockbuster exhibition
p422
aVin the West.
p423
aVAnd it's the subject of a huge debate
p424
aVabout what this cylinder means, what Cyrus means,
p425
aVbut above all, Cyrus as articulated through this cylinder \u2014
p426
aVCyrus as the defender of the homeland,
p427
aVthe champion, of course, of Iranian identity
p428
aVand of the Iranian peoples,
p429
aVtolerant of all faiths.
p430
aVAnd in the current Iran,
p431
aVZoroastrians and Christians have guaranteed places
p432
aVin the Iranian parliament, something to be very, very proud of.
p433
aa(lp434
VTo see this object in Tehran,
p435
aVthousands of Jews living in Iran
p436
aVcame to Tehran to see it.
p437
aVIt became a great emblem,
p438
aVa great subject of debate
p439
aVabout what Iran is at home and abroad.
p440
aVIs Iran still to be the defender of the oppressed?
p441
aVWill Iran set free the people
p442
aVthat the tyrants have enslaved and expropriated?
p443
aVThis is heady national rhetoric,
p444
aVand it was all put together
p445
aVin a great pageant
p446
aVlaunching the return.
p447
aVHere you see this out-sized Cyrus cylinder on the stage
p448
aVwith great figures from Iranian history
p449
aVgathering to take their place
p450
aVin the heritage of Iran.
p451
aVIt was a narrative presented
p452
aVby the president himself.
p453
aa(lp454
VAnd for me,
p455
aVto take this object to Iran,
p456
aVto be allowed to take this object to Iran
p457
aVwas to be allowed to be part
p458
aVof an extraordinary debate
p459
aVled at the highest levels
p460
aVabout what Iran is,
p461
aVwhat different Irans there are
p462
aVand how the different histories of Iran
p463
aVmight shape the world today.
p464
aVIt's a debate that's still continuing,
p465
aVand it will continue to rumble,
p466
aVbecause this object
p467
aVis one of the great declarations
p468
aVof a human aspiration.
p469
aVIt stands with the American constitution.
p470
aVIt certainly says far more about real freedoms
p471
aVthan Magna Carta.
p472
aVIt is a document that can mean so many things,
p473
aVfor Iran and for the region.
p474
aa(lp475
VA replica of this
p476
aVis at the United Nations.
p477
aVIn New York this autumn, it will be present
p478
aVwhen the great debates
p479
aVabout the future of the Middle East take place.
p480
aVAnd I want to finish by asking you
p481
aVwhat the next story will be
p482
aVin which this object figures.
p483
aVIt will appear, certainly,
p484
aVin many more Middle Eastern stories.
p485
aVAnd what story of the Middle East,
p486
aVwhat story of the world,
p487
aVdo you want to see
p488
aVreflecting what is said,
p489
aVwhat is expressed in this cylinder?
p490
aVThe right of peoples
p491
aVto live together in the same state,
p492
