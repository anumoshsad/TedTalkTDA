VWhat I want to talk about is, as background,
p4
aVis the idea that cars are art.
p5
aVThis is actually quite meaningful to me,
p6
aVbecause car designers tend to be a little bit low on the totem pole \u2014
p7
aVwe don't do coffee table books with just one lamp inside of it \u2014
p8
aVand cars are thought so much as a product
p9
aVthat it's a little bit difficult to get into the aesthetic side
p10
aVunder the same sort of terminology that one would discuss art.
p11
aVAnd so cars, as art, brings it into an emotional plane \u2014 if you accept that \u2014
p12
aVthat you have to deal with on the same level you would with art with a capital A.
p13
aa(lp14
VNow at this point you're going to see a picture of Michelangelo.
p15
aVThis is completely different than automobiles.
p16
aVAutomobiles are self-moving things, right? Elevators are automobiles.
p17
aVAnd they're not very emotional; they solve a purpose;
p18
aVand certainly automobiles have been around for 100 years
p19
aVand have made our lives functionally a lot better in many ways;
p20
aVthey've also been a real pain in the ass,
p21
aVbecause automobiles are really the thing we have to solve.
p22
aVWe have to solve the pollution, we have to solve the congestion \u2014
p23
aVbut that's not what interests me in this speech.
p24
aa(lp25
VWhat interests me in this speech is cars. Automobiles may be what you use,
p26
aVbut cars are what we are, in many ways.
p27
aVAnd as long as we can solve the problems of automobiles,
p28
aVand I believe we can, with fuel cells or hydrogen, like BMW is really hip on,
p29
aVand lots of other things, then I think we can look past that
p30
aVand try and understand why this hook is in many of us \u2014
p31
aVof this car-y-ness \u2014 and what that means, what we can learn from it.
p32
aVThat's what I want to get to. Cars are not a suit of clothes;
p33
aVcars are an avatar. Cars are an expansion of yourself:
p34
aVthey take your thoughts, your ideas, your emotions, and they multiply it \u2014
p35
aVyour anger, whatever. It's an avatar.
p36
aVIt's a super-waldo that you happen to be inside of, and if you feel sexy,
p37
aVthe car is sexy. And if you're full of road rage,
p38
aVyou've got a "Chevy: Like a Rock," right?
p39
aa(lp40
VCars are a sculpture \u2014 did you know this?
p41
aVThat every car you see out there is sculpted by hand.
p42
aVMany people think, "Well, it's computers,
p43
aVand it's done by machines and stuff like that."
p44
aVWell, they reproduce it, but the originals are all done by hand.
p45
aVIt's done by men and women who believe a lot in their craft.
p46
aVAnd they put that same kind of tension into the sculpting of a car
p47
aVthat you do in a great sculpture that you would go and look at in a museum.
p48
aVThat tension between the need to express, the need to discover,
p49
aVthen you put something new into it,
p50
aVand at the same time you have bounds of craftsmanship.
p51
aVRules that say, this is how you handle surfaces;
p52
aVthis is what control is all about; this is how you show you're a master of your craft.
p53
aVAnd that tension, that discovery, that push for something new \u2014
p54
aVand at the same time, that sense of obligation
p55
aVto the regards of craftsmanship \u2014
p56
aVthat's as strong in cars as it is in anything.
p57
aVWe work in clay, which hasn't changed much
p58
aVsince Michelangelo started screwing around with it,
p59
aVand there's a very interesting analogy to that too.
p60
aVReal quickly \u2014 Michelangelo once said he's there to "discover the figure within," OK?
p61
aVThere we go, the automobile.
p62
aVThat was 100 years right there \u2014 did you catch that?
p63
aVBetween that one there, and that one there, it changed a lot didn't it?
p64
aVOK, it's not marketing; there's a very interesting car concept here,
p65
aVbut the marketing part is not what I want to talk about here.
p66
aVI want to talk about this.
p67
aVWhy it means you have to wash a car, what is it, that sensuality
p68
aVyou have to touch about it? That's the sculpture that goes into it. That sensuality.
p69
aVAnd it's done by men and women working just like this, making cars.
p70
aa(lp71
VNow this little quote about sculpture from Henry Moore,
p72
aVI believe that that "pressure within" that Moore's talking about \u2014
p73
aVat least when it comes to cars \u2014
p74
aVcomes right back to this idea of the mean.
p75
aVIt's that will to live, that need to survive, to express itself,
p76
aVthat comes in a car, and takes over people like me.
p77
aVAnd we tell other people, "Do this, do this, do this," until this thing comes alive.
p78
aVWe are completely infected. And beauty can be the result
p79
aVof this infectiousness; it's quite wonderful.
p80
aVThis sculpture is, of course, at the heart of all of it,
p81
aVand it's really what puts the craftsmanship into our cars.
p82
aVAnd it's not a whole lot different, really, when they're working like this,
p83
aVor when somebody works like this.
p84
aVIt's that same kind of commitment, that same kind of beauty.
p85
aa(lp86
VNow, now I get to the point. I want to talk about cars as art.
p87
aVArt, in the Platonic sense, is truth; it's beauty, and love.
p88
aVNow this is really where designers in car business diverge from the engineers.
p89
aVWe don't really have a problem talking about love.
p90
aVWe don't have a problem talking about truth or beauty in that sense.
p91
aVThat's what we're searching for \u2014
p92
aVwhen we're working our craft, we are really trying to find that truth out there.
p93
aVWe're not trying to find vanity and beauty.
p94
aVWe're trying to find the beauty in the truth.
p95
aVHowever, engineers tend to look at things a little bit more Newtonian,
p96
aVinstead of this quantum approach.
p97
aVWe're dealing with irrationalisms,
p98
aVand we're dealing with paradoxes that we admit exist,
p99
aVand the engineers tend to look things a little bit more like
p100
aVtwo and two is four, and if you get 4.0 it's better, and 4.000 is even better.
p101
aVAnd that sometimes leads to bit of a divergence
p102
aVin why we're doing what we're doing.
p103
aVWe've pretty much accepted the fact, though,
p104
aVthat we are the women in the organization at BMW \u2014
p105
aVBMW is a very manly type business, \u2014 men, men, men; it's engineers.
p106
aVAnd we're kind of the female side to that. That's OK,
p107
aVthat's cool. You go off and be manly. We're going to be a little bit more female.
p108
aVBecause what we're interested in is finding form that's more than just a function.
p109
aa(lp110
VWe're interested in finding beauty that's more than just an aesthetic;
p111
aVit's really a truth.
p112
aVAnd I think this idea of soul, as being at the heart of great cars,
p113
aVis very applicable. You all know it. You know a car when you've seen it,
p114
aVwith soul. You know how strong this is.
p115
aVWell, this experience of love, and the experience of design, to me,
p116
aVare interchangeable. And now I'm coming to my story.
p117
aa(lp118
VI discovered something about love and design through a project called Deep Blue.
p119
aVAnd first of all, you have to go with me for a second, and say,
p120
aVyou know, you could take the word "love" out of a lot of things in our society,
p121
aVput the word "design" in, and it still works,
p122
aVlike this quote here, you know. It kind of works, you know?
p123
aVYou can understand that. It works in truisms.
p124
aV"All is fair in design and war."
p125
aVCertainly we live in a competitive society.
p126
aVI think this one here, there's a pop song
p127
aVthat really describes Philippe Starck for me, you know, this is like
p128
aVyou know, this is like puppy love, you know, this is cool right?
p129
aVToothbrush, cool.
p130
aVIt really only gets serious when you look at something like this. OK?
p131
aa(lp132
V(Laughter)
p133
aa(lp134
VThis is one substitution that I believe
p135
aVall of us, in design management, are guilty of.
p136
aVAnd this idea that there is more to love,
p137
aVmore to design, when it gets down to your neighbor, your other,
p138
aVit can be physical like this, and maybe in the future it will be.
p139
aVBut right now it's in dealing with our own people,
p140
aVour own teams who are doing the creating. So, to my story.
p141
aVThe idea of people-work is what we work with here,
p142
aVand I have to make a bond with my designers when we're creating BMWs.
p143
aVWe have to have a shared intimacy, a shared vision \u2014
p144
aVthat means we have to work as one family;
p145
aVwe have to understand ourselves that way.
p146
aVThere's good times; there's interesting times;
p147
aVand there's some stress times too.
p148
aVYou want to do cars, you've got to go outside.
p149
aVYou've got to do cars in the rain; you've got to do cars in the snow.
p150
aVThat's, by the way, is a presentation we made to our board of directors.
p151
aVWe haul their butts out in the snow, too. You want to know cars outside?
p152
aVWell, you've got to stand outside to do this.
p153
aVAnd because these are artists, they have very artistic temperaments.
p154
aVAll right? Now one thing about art is, art is discovery,
p155
aVand art is discovering yourself through your art. Right?
p156
aVAnd one thing about cars is we're all a little bit like Pygmalion,
p157
aVwe are completely in love with our own creations.
p158
aVThis is one of my favorite paintings, it really describes our relationship with cars.
p159
aVThis is sick beyond belief.
p160
aa(lp161
V(Laughter)
p162
aa(lp163
VBut because of this, the intimacy with which we work together as a team
p164
aVtakes on a new dimension, a new meaning.
p165
aVWe have a shared center; we have a shared focus \u2014
p166
aVthat car stays at the middle of all our relationships.
p167
aVAnd it's my job, in the competitive process, to narrow this down.
p168
aVI heard today about Joseph's death genes
p169
aVthat have to go in and kill cell reproduction.
p170
aVYou know, that's what I have to do sometimes.
p171
aVWe start out with 10 cars; we narrow it down to five cars,
p172
aVdown to three cars, down to two cars, down to one car,
p173
aVand I'm in the middle of that killing, basically.
p174
aVSomeone's love, someone's baby.
p175
aVThis is very difficult, and you have to have a bond with your team
p176
aVthat permits you to do this, because their life is wrapped up in that too.
p177
aVThey've got that gene infected in them as well,
p178
aVand they want that to live, more than anything else.
p179
aa(lp180
VWell, this project, Deep Blue, put me in contact with my team
p181
aVin a way that I never expected, and I want to pass it on to you,
p182
aVbecause I want you to reflect on this, perhaps in your own relationships.
p183
aVWe wanted to a do a car which was a complete leap of faith for BMW.
p184
aVWe wanted to do a team which was so removed from the way we'd done it,
p185
aVthat I only had a phone number that connected me to them.
p186
aVSo, what we did was: instead of having a staff of artists that are just your wrist,
p187
aVwe decided to free up a team of creative designers and engineers
p188
aVto find out what's the successor to the SUV phenomenon in America.
p189
aVThis is 1996 we did this project. And so we sent them off with this team name,
p190
aVDeep Blue. Now many people know Deep Blue from IBM \u2014
p191
aVwe actually stole it from them because we figured
p192
aVif anybody read our faxes they'd think we're talking about computers.
p193
aVIt turned out it was quite clever because Deep Blue,
p194
aVin a company like BMW, has a hook \u2014 "Deep Blue," wow, cool name.
p195
aVSo people get wrapped up in it. And we took a team of designers,
p196
aVand we sent them off to America. And we gave them a budget,
p197
aVwhat we thought was a set of deliverables,
p198
aVa timetable, and nothing else.
p199
aVLike I said, I just had a phone number that connected me to them.
p200
aa(lp201
VAnd a group of engineers worked in Germany,
p202
aVand the idea was they would work separately
p203
aVon this problem of what's the successor to the SUV.
p204
aVThey would come together, compare notes. Then they would work apart,
p205
aVcome together, and they would produce together
p206
aVa monumental set of diverse opinions that didn't pollute each other's ideas \u2014
p207
aVbut at the same time came together and resolved the problems.
p208
aVHopefully, really understand the customer at its heart,
p209
aVwhere the customer is, live with them in America. So \u2014 sent the team off,
p210
aVand actually something different happened. They went other places.
p211
aa(lp212
V(Laughter)
p213
aa(lp214
VThey disappeared, quite honestly, and all I got was postcards.
p215
aVNow, I got some postcards of these guys in Las Vegas,
p216
aVand I got some postcards of these guys in the Grand Canyon,
p217
aVand I got these postcards of Niagara Falls,
p218
aVand pretty soon they're in New York, and I don't know where else.
p219
aVAnd I'm telling myself, "This is going to be a great car,
p220
aVthey're doing research that I've never even thought about before."
p221
aVRight? And they decided that instead of, like, having a studio,
p222
aVand six or seven apartments,
p223
aVit was cheaper to rent Elizabeth Taylor's ex-house in Malibu.
p224
aVAnd \u2014 at least they told me it was her house,
p225
aVI guess it was at one time, she had a party there or something.
p226
aVBut anyway, this was the house, and they all lived there.
p227
aVNow this is 24/7 living, half-a-dozen people who'd left their \u2014
p228
aVsome had left their wives behind and families behind,
p229
aVand they literally lived in this house
p230
aVfor the entire six months the project was in America,
p231
aVbut the first three months were the most intensive.
p232
aVAnd one of the young women in the project,
p233
aVshe was a fantastic lady, she actually built her room in the bathroom.
p234
aVThe bathroom was so big, she built the bed over the bathtub \u2014
p235
aVit's quite fascinating.
p236
aa(lp237
VOn the other hand, I didn't know anything about this. OK?
p238
aVNothing. This is all going on, and all I'm getting is postcards
p239
aVof these guys in Las Vegas, or whatever,
p240
aVsaying, "Don't worry Chris, this is really going to be good." OK?
p241
aVSo my concept of what a design studio was probably \u2014
p242
aVI wasn't up to speed on where these guys were.
p243
aa(lp244
VHowever, the engineers back in Munich
p245
aVhad taken on this kind of Newtonian solution,
p246
aVand they were trying to find how many cup holders
p247
aVcan dance on the head of a pin, and, you know,
p248
aVthese really serious questions that are confronting the modern consumer.
p249
aVAnd one was hoping that these two teams would get together,
p250
aVand this collusion of incredible creativity,
p251
aVunder these incredible surroundings,
p252
aVand these incredibly stressed-out engineers,
p253
aVwould create some incredible solutions.
p254
aVWell, what I didn't know was, and what we found out was \u2014
p255
aVthese guys, they can't even like talk to each other under those conditions.
p256
aVYou get a divergence of Newtonian and quantum thinking at that point,
p257
aVyou have a split in your dialog that is so deep, and so far,
p258
aVthat they cannot bring this together at all.
p259
aa(lp260
VAnd so we had our first meeting, after three months, in Tiburon,
p261
aVwhich is just up the road from here \u2014 you know Tiburon?
p262
aVAnd the idea was after the first three months of this independent research
p263
aVthey would present it all to Dr. Goschel \u2014
p264
aVwho is now my boss, and at that time he was co-mentor on the project \u2014
p265
aVand they would present their results.
p266
aVWe would see where we were going,
p267
aVwe would see the first indication of what could be
p268
aVthe successive phenomenon to the SUV in America.
p269
aVAnd so I had these ideas in my head, that this is going to be great.
p270
aVI mean, I'm going to see so much work, it's so intense \u2014
p271
aVI know probably Las Vegas meant a lot about it,
p272
aVand I'm not really sure where the Grand Canyon came in either \u2014
p273
aVbut somehow all this is going to come together,
p274
aVand I'm going to see some really great product.
p275
aVSo we went to Tiburon, after three months,
p276
aVand the team had gotten together the week before,
p277
aVmany days ahead of time.
p278
aVThe engineers flew over, and designers got together with them,
p279
aVand they put their presentation together.
p280
aa(lp281
VWell, it turns out that the engineers hadn't done anything.
p282
aVAnd they hadn't done anything because \u2014
p283
aVkind of, like in car business, engineers are there to solve problems,
p284
aVand we were asking them to create a problem.
p285
aVAnd the engineers were waiting for the designers to say,
p286
aV"This is the problem that we've created, now help us solve it."
p287
aVAnd they couldn't talk about it. So what happened was,
p288
aVthe engineers showed up with nothing.
p289
aVAnd the engineers told the designers,
p290
aV"If you go in with all your stuff, we'll walk out,
p291
aVwe'll walk right out of the project."
p292
aa(lp293
VSo I didn't know any of this,
p294
aVand we got a presentation that had an agenda, looked like this.
p295
aVThere was a whole lot of dialog.
p296
aVWe spent four hours being told all about vocabulary
p297
aVthat needs to be built between engineers and designers.
p298
aVAnd here I'm expecting at any moment, "OK, they're going to turn the page,
p299
aVand I'm going to see the cars, I'm going to see the sketches,
p300
aVI'm going to see maybe some idea of where it's going."
p301
aVDialog kept on going, with mental maps of words, and pretty soon
p302
aVit was becoming obvious that instead of being dazzled with brilliance,
p303
aVI was seriously being baffled with bullshit.
p304
aVAnd if you can imagine what this is like,
p305
aVto have these months of postcard indication of how great this team is working,
p306
aVand they're out there spending all this money, and they're learning,
p307
aVand they're doing all this stuff.
p308
aVI went fucking ballistic, right? I went nuts.
p309
aVYou can probably remember Tiburon, it used to look like this.
p310
aa(lp311
VAfter four hours of this, I stood up, and I took this team apart.
p312
aVI screamed at them, I yelled at them, "What the hell are you doing?
p313
aVYou're letting me down, you're my designers,
p314
aVyou're supposed to be the creative ones,
p315
aVwhat the hell is going on around here?"
p316
aVIt was probably one of my better tirades, I have some good ones,
p317
aVbut this was probably one of my better ones. And I went into these people;
p318
aVhow could they take BMW's money,
p319
aVhow could they have a holiday for three months and produce nothing, nothing?
p320
aVBecause of course they didn't tell us that they had three station wagons
p321
aVfull of drawings, model concepts, pictures \u2014 everything I wanted,
p322
aVthey'd locked up in the cars, because they had shown solidarity with the engineers \u2014
p323
aVand they'd decided not to show me anything,
p324
aVin order to give the chance for problem solving a chance to start,
p325
aVbecause they hadn't realized, of course,
p326
aVthat they couldn't do problem creating.
p327
aVSo we went to lunch \u2014
p328
aa(lp329
V(Laughter)
p330
aa(lp331
VAnd I've got to tell you, this was one seriously quiet lunch.
p332
aVThe engineers all sat at one end of the table,
p333
aVthe designers and I sat at the other end of the table, really quiet.
p334
aVAnd I was just fucking furious, furious. OK?
p335
aVProbably because they had all the fun and I didn't, you know.
p336
aVThat's what you get furious about right?
p337
aVAnd somebody asked me about Catherine, my wife, you know,
p338
aVdid she fly out with me or something?
p339
aVI said, "No," and it triggered a set of thoughts about my wife.
p340
aVAnd I recalled that when Catherine and I were married,
p341
aVthe priest gave a very nice sermon, and he said something very important.
p342
aVHe said, "Love is not selfish," he said,
p343
aV"Love does not mean counting how many times I say, 'I love you.'
p344
aVIt doesn't mean you had sex this many times this month,
p345
aVand it's two times less than last month,
p346
aVso that means you don't love me as much.
p347
aVLove is not selfish." And I thought about this, and I thought,
p348
aV"You know, I'm not showing love here. I'm seriously not showing love.
p349
aVI'm in the air, I'm in the air without trust.
p350
aVThis cannot be. This cannot be that I'm expecting a certain number of sketches,
p351
aVand to me that's my quantification method for qualifying a team.
p352
aVThis cannot be."
p353
aa(lp354
VSo I told them this story. I said, "Guys, I'm thinking about something here,
p355
aVthis isn't right. I can't have a relationship with you guys
p356
aVbased on a premise that is a quantifiable one.
p357
aVBased on a dictate premise that says, 'I'm a boss, you do what I say, without trust.'"
p358
aVI said "This can't be."
p359
aVActually, we all broke down into tears, to be quite honest about it,
p360
aVbecause they still could not tell me how much frustration they had built up
p361
aVinside of them, not being able to show me what I wanted,
p362
aVand merely having to ask me to trust them that it would come.
p363
aVAnd I think we felt much closer that day,
p364
aVwe cut a lot of strings that didn't need to be there,
p365
aVand we forged the concept for what real team and creativity is all about.
p366
aVWe put the car back at the center of our thoughts, and we put love,
p367
aVI think, truly back into the center of the process.
p368
aa(lp369
VBy the way, that team went on to create six different concepts
p370
aVfor the next model of what would be the proposal
p371
aVfor the next generation after SUVs in America.
p372
