VAlisa Volkman: So this is where our story begins \u2014
p4
aVthe dramatic moments of the birth
p5
aVof our first son, Declan.
p6
aVObviously a really profound moment,
p7
aVand it changed our lives in many ways.
p8
aVIt also changed our lives in many unexpected ways,
p9
aVand those unexpected ways we later reflected on,
p10
aVthat eventually spawned a business idea between the two of us,
p11
aVand a year later, we launched Babble,
p12
aVa website for parents.
p13
aa(lp14
VRufus Griscom: Now I think of our story
p15
aVas starting a few years earlier. AV: That's true.
p16
aa(lp17
VRG: You may remember, we fell head over heels in love.
p18
aa(lp19
VAV: We did.
p20
aa(lp21
VRG: We were at the time running a very different kind of website.
p22
aVIt was a website called Nerve.com,
p23
aVthe tagline of which was "literate smut."
p24
aVIt was in theory, and hopefully in practice,
p25
aVa smart online magazine
p26
aVabout sex and culture.
p27
aa(lp28
VAV: That spawned a dating site.
p29
aVBut you can understand the jokes that we get. Sex begets babies.
p30
aVYou follow instructions on Nerve and you should end up on Babble,
p31
aVwhich we did.
p32
aVAnd we might launch a geriatric site as our third. We'll see.
p33
aa(lp34
VRG: But for us, the continuity between Nerve and Babble
p35
aVwas not just the life stage thing,
p36
aVwhich is, of course, relevant,
p37
aVbut it was really more about
p38
aVour desire to speak very honestly
p39
aVabout subjects that people have difficulty speaking honestly about.
p40
aVIt seems to us that
p41
aVwhen people start dissembling, people start lying about things,
p42
aVthat's when it gets really interesting.
p43
aVThat's a subject that we want to dive into.
p44
aVAnd we've been surprised to find, as young parents,
p45
aVthat there are almost more taboos around parenting
p46
aVthan there are around sex.
p47
aa(lp48
VAV: It's true. So like we said,
p49
aVthe early years were really wonderful,
p50
aVbut they were also really difficult.
p51
aVAnd we feel like some of that difficulty
p52
aVwas because of this false advertisement around parenting.
p53
aV(Laughter)
p54
aVWe subscribed to a lot of magazines, did our homework,
p55
aVbut really everywhere you look around, we were surrounded by images like this.
p56
aVAnd we went into parenting
p57
aVexpecting our lives to look like this.
p58
aVThe sun was always streaming in, and our children would never be crying.
p59
aVI would always be perfectly coiffed and well rested,
p60
aVand in fact, it was not like that at all.
p61
aa(lp62
VRG: When we lowered the glossy parenting magazine
p63
aVthat we were looking at, with these beautiful images,
p64
aVand looked at the scene in our actual living room,
p65
aVit looked a little bit more like this.
p66
aVThese are our three sons.
p67
aVAnd of course, they're not always crying and screaming,
p68
aVbut with three boys, there's a decent probability
p69
aVthat at least one of them will not be comporting himself
p70
aVexactly as he should.
p71
aa(lp72
VAV: Yes, you can see where the disconnect was happening for us.
p73
aVWe really felt like what we went in expecting
p74
aVhad nothing to do with what we were actually experiencing,
p75
aVand so we decided we really wanted to give it to parents straight.
p76
aVWe really wanted to let them understand
p77
aVwhat the realities of parenting were in an honest way.
p78
aa(lp79
VRG: So today, what we would love to do
p80
aVis share with you four parenting taboos.
p81
aVAnd of course, there are many more than four things
p82
aVyou can't say about parenting,
p83
aVbut we would like to share with you today
p84
aVfour that are particularly relevant for us personally.
p85
aVSo the first, taboo number one:
p86
aVyou can't say you didn't fall in love with your baby
p87
aVin the very first minute.
p88
aVI remember vividly, sitting there in the hospital.
p89
aVWe were in the process of giving birth to our first child.
p90
aa(lp91
VAV: We, or I?
p92
aa(lp93
VRG: I'm sorry.
p94
aVMisuse of the pronoun.
p95
aVAlisa was very generously in the process
p96
aVof giving birth to our first child \u2014 (AV: Thank you.)
p97
aV\u2014 and I was there with a catcher's mitt.
p98
aVAnd I was there with my arms open.
p99
aVThe nurse was coming at me
p100
aVwith this beautiful, beautiful child,
p101
aVand I remember, as she was approaching me,
p102
aVthe voices of friends saying,
p103
aV"The moment they put the baby in your hands,
p104
aVyou will feel a sense of love that will come over you
p105
aVthat is [on] an order of magnitude more powerful
p106
aVthan anything you've ever experienced in your entire life."
p107
aVSo I was bracing myself for the moment.
p108
aVThe baby was coming,
p109
aVand I was ready for this Mack truck of love
p110
aVto just knock me off my feet.
p111
aVAnd instead, when the baby was placed in my hands,
p112
aVit was an extraordinary moment.
p113
aVThis picture is from literally a few seconds after
p114
aVthe baby was placed in my hands and I brought him over.
p115
aVAnd you can see, our eyes were glistening.
p116
aVI was overwhelmed with love and affection for my wife,
p117
aVwith deep, deep gratitude
p118
aVthat we had what appeared to be a healthy child.
p119
aVAnd it was also, of course, surreal.
p120
aVI mean, I had to check the tags and make sure.
p121
aVI was incredulous, "Are you sure this is our child?"
p122
aVAnd this was all quite remarkable.
p123
aVBut what I felt towards the child at that moment was deep affection,
p124
aVbut nothing like what I feel for him now, five years later.
p125
aa(lp126
VAnd so we've done something here
p127
aVthat is heretical.
p128
aVWe have charted
p129
aVour love for our child over time.
p130
aV(Laughter)
p131
aVThis, as you know, is an act of heresy.
p132
aVYou're not allowed to chart love.
p133
aVThe reason you're not allowed to chart love
p134
aVis because we think of love as a binary thing.
p135
aVYou're either in love, or you're not in love.
p136
aVYou love, or you don't love.
p137
aVAnd I think the reality is that love is a process,
p138
aVand I think the problem with thinking of love
p139
aVas something that's binary
p140
aVis that it causes us
p141
aVto be unduly concerned
p142
aVthat love is fraudulent, or inadequate, or what have you.
p143
aVAnd I think I'm speaking obviously here to the father's experience.
p144
aVBut I think a lot of men do go through this sense
p145
aVin the early months, maybe their first year,
p146
aVthat their emotional response is inadequate in some fashion.
p147
aa(lp148
VAV: Well, I'm glad Rufus is bringing this up,
p149
aVbecause you can notice where he dips in the first years
p150
aVwhere I think I was doing most of the work.
p151
aVBut we like to joke,
p152
aVin the first few months of all of our children's lives,
p153
aVthis is Uncle Rufus.
p154
aV(Laughter)
p155
aa(lp156
VRG: I'm a very affectionate uncle, very affectionate uncle.
p157
aa(lp158
VAV: Yes, and I often joke with Rufus when he comes home
p159
aVthat I'm not sure he would actually be able to find our child in a line-up
p160
aVamongst other babies.
p161
aVSo I actually threw a pop quiz here onto Rufus.
p162
aa(lp163
VRG: Uh oh.
p164
aa(lp165
VAV: I don't want to embarrass him too much. But I am going to give him three seconds.
p166
aa(lp167
VRG: That is not fair. This is a trick question. He's not up there, is he?
p168
aa(lp169
VAV: Our eight-week-old son is somewhere in here,
p170
aVand I want to see if Rufus can actually quickly identify him.
p171
aa(lp172
VRG: The far left. AV: No!
p173
aa(lp174
V(Laughter)
p175
aa(lp176
VRG: Cruel.
p177
aa(lp178
VAV: Nothing more to be said.
p179
aa(lp180
V(Laughter)
p181
aa(lp182
VI'll move on to taboo number two.
p183
aVYou can't talk about how lonely having a baby can be.
p184
aVI enjoyed being pregnant. I loved it.
p185
aVI felt incredibly connected to the community around me.
p186
aVI felt like everyone was participating in my pregnancy, all around me,
p187
aVtracking it down till the actual due-date.
p188
aVI felt like I was a vessel of the future of humanity.
p189
aVThat continued into the the hospital. It was really exhilarating.
p190
aVI was shower with gifts and flowers and visitors.
p191
aVIt was a really wonderful experience,
p192
aVbut when I got home,
p193
aVI suddenly felt very disconnected
p194
aVand suddenly shut in and shut out,
p195
aVand I was really surprised by those feelings.
p196
aVI did expect it to be difficult,
p197
aVhave sleepless nights, constant feedings,
p198
aVbut I did not expect the feelings
p199
aVof isolation and loneliness that I experienced,
p200
aVand I was really surprised that no one had talked to me,
p201
aVthat I was going to be feeling this way.
p202
aVAnd I called my sister
p203
aVwhom I'm very close to \u2014 and had three children \u2014
p204
aVand I asked her, "Why didn't you tell me
p205
aVI was going to be feeling this way,
p206
aVthat I was going to have these \u2014 feeling incredibly isolated?"
p207
aVAnd she said \u2014 I'll never forget \u2014
p208
aV"It's just not something you want to say to a mother
p209
aVthat's having a baby for the first time."
p210
aa(lp211
VRG: And of course, we think
p212
aVit's precisely what you really should be saying
p213
aVto mothers who have kids for the first time.
p214
aVAnd that this, of course, one of the themes for us
p215
aVis that we think
p216
aVthat candor and brutal honesty
p217
aVis critical to us collectively
p218
aVbeing great parents.
p219
aVAnd it's hard not to think
p220
aVthat part of what leads to this sense of isolation
p221
aVis our modern world.
p222
aVSo Alisa's experience is not isolated.
p223
aVSo your 58 percent of mothers surveyed
p224
aVreport feelings of loneliness.
p225
aVOf those, 67 percent are most lonely
p226
aVwhen their kids are zero to five \u2014 probably really zero to two.
p227
aVIn the process of preparing this,
p228
aVwe looked at how some other cultures around the world
p229
aVdeal with this period of time,
p230
aVbecause here in the Western world,
p231
aVless than 50 percent of us live near our family members,
p232
aVwhich I think is part of why this is such a tough period.
p233
aVSo to take one example among many:
p234
aVin Southern India
p235
aVthere's a practice known as jholabhari,
p236
aVin which the pregnant woman, when she's seven or eight months pregnant,
p237
aVmoves in with her mother
p238
aVand goes through a series of rituals and ceremonies,
p239
aVgive birth and returns home to her nuclear family
p240
aVseveral months after the child is born.
p241
aVAnd this is one of many ways
p242
aVthat we think other cultures offset this kind of lonely period.
p243
aa(lp244
VAV: So taboo number three:
p245
aVyou can't talk about your miscarriage \u2014 but today I'll talk about mine.
p246
aVSo after we had Declan,
p247
aVwe kind of recalibrated our expectations.
p248
aVWe thought we actually could go through this again
p249
aVand thought we knew what we would be up against.
p250
aVAnd we were grateful that I was able to get pregnant,
p251
aVand I soon learned that we were having a boy,
p252
aVand then when I was five months,
p253
aVwe learned that we had lost our child.
p254
aVThis is actually the last little image we have of him.
p255
aVAnd it was obviously a very difficult time \u2014
p256
aVreally painful.
p257
aVAs I was working through that mourning process,
p258
aVI was amazed that I didn't want to see anybody.
p259
aVI really wanted to crawl into a hole,
p260
aVand I didn't really know how I was going
p261
aVto work my way back into my surrounding community.
p262
aVAnd I realize, I think, the way I was feeling that way,
p263
aVis on a really deep gut level,
p264
aVI was feeling a lot of shame
p265
aVand embarrassed, frankly,
p266
aVthat, in some respects, I had failed
p267
aVat delivering what I'm genetically engineered to do.
p268
aVAnd of course, it made me question,
p269
aVif I wasn't able to have another child,
p270
aVwhat would that mean for my marriage,
p271
aVand just me as a woman.
p272
aVSo it was a very difficult time.
p273
aVAs I started working through it more,
p274
aVI started climbing out of that hole and talking with other people.
p275
aVI was really amazed
p276
aVby all the stories that started flooding in.
p277
aVPeople I interacted with daily,
p278
aVworked with, was friends with,
p279
aVfamily members that I had known a long time,
p280
aVhad never shared with me their own stories.
p281
aVAnd I just remember feeling all these stories came out of the woodwork,
p282
aVand I felt like I happened upon
p283
aVthis secret society of women that I now was a part of,
p284
aVwhich was reassuring and also really concerning.
p285
aVAnd I think,
p286
aVmiscarriage is an invisible loss.
p287
aVThere's not really a lot of community support around it.
p288
aVThere's really no ceremony,
p289
aVrituals, or rites.
p290
aVAnd I think, with a death, you have a funeral, you celebrate the life,
p291
aVand there's a lot of community support,
p292
aVand it's something women don't have with miscarriage.
p293
aa(lp294
VRG: Which is too bad because, of course,
p295
aVit's a very common and very traumatic experience.
p296
aVFifteen to 20 percent of all pregnancies result in miscarriage,
p297
aVand I find this astounding.
p298
aVIn a survey, 74 percent of women said
p299
aVthat miscarriage, they felt, was partly their fault, which is awful.
p300
aVAnd astoundingly, 22 percent
p301
aVsaid they would hide a miscarriage from their spouse.
p302
aa(lp303
VSo taboo number four:
p304
aVyou can't say that your average happiness
p305
aVhas declined since having a child.
p306
aVThe party line is that every single aspect of my life
p307
aVhas just gotten dramatically better
p308
aVever since I participated
p309
aVin the miracle that is childbirth and family.
p310
aVI'll never forget, I remember vividly to this day,
p311
aVour first son, Declan, was nine months old,
p312
aVand I was sitting there on the couch,
p313
aVand I was reading Daniel Gilbert's wonderful book, "Stumbling on Happiness."
p314
aVAnd I got about two-thirds of the way through,
p315
aVand there was a chart on the right-hand side \u2014
p316
aVon the right-hand page \u2014
p317
aVthat we've labeled here
p318
aV"The Most Terrifying Chart Imaginable
p319
aVfor a New Parent."
p320
aVThis chart is comprised of four completely independent studies.
p321
aVBasically, there's this precipitous drop
p322
aVof marital satisfaction,
p323
aVwhich is closely aligned, we all know, with broader happiness,
p324
aVthat doesn't rise again
p325
aVuntil your first child goes to college.
p326
aVSo I'm sitting here looking at the next two decades of my life,
p327
aVthis chasm of happiness
p328
aVthat we're driving our proverbial convertible straight into.
p329
aVWe were despondent.
p330
aa(lp331
VAV: So you can imagine, I mean again, the first few months were difficult,
p332
aVbut we'd come out of it,
p333
aVand were really shocked to see this study.
p334
aVSo we really wanted to take a deeper look at it
p335
aVin hopes that we would find a silver lining.
p336
aa(lp337
VRG: And that's when it's great to be running a website for parents,
p338
aVbecause we got this incredible reporter
p339
aVto go and interview all the scientists
p340
aVwho conducted these four studies.
p341
aVWe said, something is wrong here.
p342
aVThere's something missing from these studies.
p343
aVIt can't possibly be that bad.
p344
aVSo Liz Mitchell did a wonderful job with this piece,
p345
aVand she interviewed four scientists,
p346
aVand she also interviewed Daniel Gilbert,
p347
aVand we did indeed find a silver lining.
p348
aVSo this is our guess
p349
aVas to what this baseline of average happiness
p350
aVarguably looks like throughout life.
p351
aVAverage happiness is, of course, inadequate,
p352
aVbecause it doesn't speak
p353
aVto the moment-by-moment experience,
p354
aVand so this is what we think it looks like
p355
aVwhen you layer in
p356
aVmoment-to-moment experience.
p357
aVAnd so we all remember as children,
p358
aVthe tiniest little thing \u2014 and we see it on the faces of our children \u2014
p359
aVthe teeniest little thing
p360
aVcan just rocket them to these heights
p361
aVof just utter adulation,
p362
aVand then the next teeniest little thing
p363
aVcan cause them just to plummet to the depths of despair.
p364
aVAnd it's just extraordinary to watch, and we remember it ourselves.
p365
aVAnd then, of course, as you get older,
p366
aVit's almost like age is a form of lithium.
p367
aa(lp368
VAs you get older, you become more stable.
p369
aVAnd part of what happens, I think, in your '20s and '30s,
p370
aVis you start to learn to hedge your happiness.
p371
aVYou start to realize that
p372
aV"Hey, I could go to this live music event
p373
aVand have an utterly transforming experience
p374
aVthat will cover my entire body with goosebumps,
p375
aVbut it's more likely that I'll feel claustrophobic
p376
aVand I won't be able to get a beer.
p377
aVSo I'm not going to go.
p378
aVI've got a good stereo at home. So, I'm not going to go."
p379
aVSo your average happiness goes up,
p380
aVbut you lose those transcendent moments.
p381
aa(lp382
VAV: Yeah, and then you have your first child,
p383
aVand then you really resubmit yourself
p384
aVto these highs and lows \u2014
p385
aVthe highs being the first steps, the first smile,
p386
aVyour child reading to you for the first time \u2014
p387
aVthe lows being, our house, any time from six to seven every night.
p388
aVBut you realize you resubmit yourself
p389
aVto losing control in a really wonderful way,
p390
aVwhich we think provides a lot of meaning to our lives
p391
aVand is quite gratifying.
p392
aa(lp393
VRG: And so in effect,
p394
aVwe trade average happiness.
p395
aVWe trade the sort of security and safety
p396
aVof a certain level of contentment
p397
aVfor these transcendent moments.
p398
aVSo where does that leave the two of us
p399
aVas a family with our three little boys
p400
aVin the thick of all this?
p401
aVThere's another factor in our case.
p402
aVWe have violated yet another taboo
p403
aVin our own lives,
p404
aVand this is a bonus taboo.
p405
aa(lp406
VAV: A quick bonus taboo for you, that we should not be working together,
p407
aVespecially with three children \u2014
p408
aVand we are.
p409
aa(lp410
VRG: And we had reservations about this on the front end.
p411
aVEverybody knows, you should absolutely not work with your spouse.
p412
aVIn fact, when we first went out to raise money to start Babble,
p413
aVthe venture capitalists said,
p414
aV"We categorically don't invest
p415
aVin companies founded by husbands and wives,
p416
aVbecause there's an extra point of failure.
p417
aVIt's a bad idea. Don't do it."
p418
aVAnd we obviously went forward. We did.
p419
aVWe raised the money, and we're thrilled that we did,
p420
aVbecause in this phase of one's life,
p421
aVthe incredibly scarce resource is time.
p422
aVAnd if you're really passionate about what you do every day \u2014 which we are \u2014
p423
aVand you're also passionate about your relationship,
p424
aVthis is the only way we know how to do it.
p425
aVAnd so the final question that we would ask is:
p426
aVcan we collectively bend that happiness chart upwards?
p427
aVIt's great that we have these transcendent moments of joy,
p428
aVbut they're sometimes pretty quick.
p429
aVAnd so how about that average baseline of happiness?
p430
aVCan we move that up a little bit?
p431
aa(lp432
VAV: And we kind of feel that the happiness gap, which we talked about,
p433
aVis really the result of walking into parenting \u2014
p434
aVand really any long-term partnership for that matter \u2014
p435
aVwith the wrong expectations.
p436
aVAnd if you have the right expectations and expectation management,
p437
aVwe feel like it's going to be a pretty gratifying experience.
p438
aa(lp439
VRG: And so this is what \u2014
p440
aVAnd we think that a lot of parents,
p441
aVwhen you get in there \u2014 in our case anyway \u2014
p442
aVyou pack your bags for a trip to Europe, and you're really excited to go.
p443
aVGet out of the airplane,
p444
aVit turns out you're trekking in Nepal.
p445
aVAnd trekking in Nepal is an extraordinary experience,
p446
aVparticularly if you pack your bags properly
p447
aVand you know what you're getting in for and you're psyched.
p448
