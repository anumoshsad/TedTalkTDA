VSo, this is a story
p4
aVabout how we know what we know.
p5
aa(lp6
VIt's a story about this woman,
p7
aVNatalia Rybczynski.
p8
aVShe's a paleobiologist,
p9
aVwhich means she specializes in digging up really old dead stuff.
p10
aa(lp11
V(Audio) Natalia Rybczynski: Yeah, I had someone call me "Dr. Dead Things."
p12
aa(lp13
VLatif Nasser: And I think she's particularly interesting
p14
aVbecause of where she digs that stuff up,
p15
aVway above the Arctic Circle in the remote Canadian tundra.
p16
aa(lp17
VNow, one summer day in 2006,
p18
aVshe was at a dig site called the Fyles Leaf Bed,
p19
aVwhich is less than 10 degrees latitude away from the magnetic north pole.
p20
aa(lp21
V(Audio) NR: Really, it's not going to sound very exciting,
p22
aVbecause it was a day of walking with your backpack and your GPS
p23
aVand notebook and just picking up anything that might be a fossil.
p24
aa(lp25
VLN: And at some point, she noticed something.
p26
aa(lp27
V(Audio) NR: Rusty, kind of rust-colored,
p28
aVabout the size of the palm of my hand.
p29
aVIt was just lying on the surface.
p30
aa(lp31
VLN: And at first she thought it was just a splinter of wood,
p32
aVbecause that's the sort of thing people had found
p33
aVat the Fyles Leaf Bed before \u2014 prehistoric plant parts.
p34
aVBut that night, back at camp ...
p35
aa(lp36
V(Audio) NR: ... I get out the hand lens,
p37
aVI'm looking a little bit more closely and realizing
p38
aVit doesn't quite look like this has tree rings.
p39
aVMaybe it's a preservation thing,
p40
aVbut it looks really like ...
p41
aVbone.
p42
aa(lp43
VLN: Huh. So over the next four years,
p44
aVshe went to that spot over and over,
p45
aVand eventually collected 30 fragments of that exact same bone,
p46
aVmost of them really tiny.
p47
aa(lp48
V(Audio) NR: It's not a whole lot. It fits in a small Ziploc bag.
p49
aa(lp50
VLN: And she tried to piece them together like a jigsaw puzzle.
p51
aVBut it was challenging.
p52
aa(lp53
V(Audio) NR: It's broken up into so many little tiny pieces,
p54
aVI'm trying to use sand and putty, and it's not looking good.
p55
aVSo finally, we used a 3D surface scanner.
p56
aa(lp57
VLN: Ooh! NR: Yeah, right?
p58
aa(lp59
V(Laughter)
p60
aa(lp61
VLN: It turns out it was way easier to do it virtually.
p62
aa(lp63
V(Audio) NR: It's kind of magical when it all fits together.
p64
aa(lp65
VLN: How certain were you that you had it right,
p66
aVthat you had put it together in the right way?
p67
aVWas there a potential that you'd put it together a different way
p68
aVand have, like, a parakeet or something?
p69
aa(lp70
V(Laughter)
p71
aa(lp72
V(Audio) NR: (Laughs) Um, no. No, we got this.
p73
aa(lp74
VLN: What she had, she discovered, was a tibia, a leg bone,
p75
aVand specifically, one that belonged to a cloven-hoofed mammal,
p76
aVso something like a cow or a sheep.
p77
aVBut it couldn't have been either of those.
p78
aVIt was just too big.
p79
aa(lp80
V(Audio) NR: The size of this thing, it was huge. It's a really big animal.
p81
aa(lp82
VLN: So what animal could it be?
p83
aVHaving hit a wall, she showed one of the fragments
p84
aVto some colleagues of hers in Colorado,
p85
aVand they had an idea.
p86
aa(lp87
V(Audio) NR: We took a saw, and we nicked just the edge of it,
p88
aVand there was this really interesting smell that comes from it.
p89
aa(lp90
VLN: It smelled kind of like singed flesh.
p91
aVIt was a smell that Natalia recognized
p92
aVfrom cutting up skulls in her gross anatomy lab:
p93
aVcollagen.
p94
aVCollagen is what gives structure to our bones.
p95
aVAnd usually, after so many years,
p96
aVit breaks down.
p97
aVBut in this case, the Arctic had acted like a natural freezer and preserved it.
p98
aa(lp99
VThen a year or two later, Natalia was at a conference in Bristol,
p100
aVand she saw that a colleague of hers named Mike Buckley
p101
aVwas demoing this new process that he called "collagen fingerprinting."
p102
aVIt turns out that different species have slightly different structures
p103
aVof collagen,
p104
aVso if you get a collagen profile of an unknown bone,
p105
aVyou can compare it to those of known species,
p106
aVand, who knows, maybe you get a match.
p107
aa(lp108
VSo she shipped him one of the fragments,
p109
aVFedEx.
p110
aa(lp111
V(Audio) NR: Yeah, you want to track it. It's kind of important.
p112
aa(lp113
V(Laughter)
p114
aa(lp115
VLN: And he processed it,
p116
aVand compared it to 37 known and modern-day mammal species.
p117
aVAnd he found a match.
p118
aVIt turns out that the 3.5 million-year-old bone
p119
aVthat Natalia had dug out of the High Arctic
p120
aVbelonged to ...
p121
aVa camel.
p122
aa(lp123
V(Laughter)
p124
aa(lp125
V(Audio) NR: And I'm thinking, what? That's amazing \u2014 if it's true.
p126
aa(lp127
VLN: So they tested a bunch of the fragments,
p128
aVand they got the same result for each one.
p129
aVHowever, based on the size of the bone that they found,
p130
aVit meant that this camel was 30 percent larger than modern-day camels.
p131
aVSo this camel would have been about nine feet tall,
p132
aVweighed around a ton.
p133
aa(lp134
V(Audience reacts)
p135
aa(lp136
VYeah.
p137
aVNatalia had found a Giant Arctic camel.
p138
aa(lp139
V(Laughter)
p140
aa(lp141
VNow, when you hear the word "camel,"
p142
aVwhat may come to mind is one of these,
p143
aVthe Bactrian camel of East and Central Asia.
p144
aVBut chances are the postcard image you have in your brain
p145
aVis one of these, the dromedary,
p146
aVquintessential desert creature \u2014
p147
aVhangs out in sandy, hot places like the Middle East and the Sahara,
p148
aVhas a big old hump on its back
p149
aVfor storing water for those long desert treks,
p150
aVhas big, broad feet to help it tromp over sand dunes.
p151
aVSo how on earth would one of these guys end up in the High Arctic?
p152
aa(lp153
VWell, scientists have known for a long time, turns out,
p154
aVeven before Natalia's discovery,
p155
aVthat camels are actually originally American.
p156
aa(lp157
V(Music: The Star-Spangled Banner)
p158
aa(lp159
V(Laughter)
p160
aa(lp161
VThey started here.
p162
aVFor nearly 40 of the 45 million years that camels have been around,
p163
aVyou could only find them in North America,
p164
aVaround 20 different species, maybe more.
p165
aa(lp166
V(Audio) LN: If I put them all in a lineup, would they look different?
p167
aa(lp168
VNR: Yeah, you're going to have different body sizes.
p169
aVYou'll have some with really long necks,
p170
aVso they're actually functionally like giraffes.
p171
aa(lp172
VLN: Some had snouts, like crocodiles.
p173
aa(lp174
V(Audio) NR: The really primitive, early ones would have been really small,
p175
aValmost like rabbits.
p176
aa(lp177
VLN: What? Rabbit-sized camels?
p178
aa(lp179
V(Audio) NR: The earliest ones.
p180
aVSo those ones you probably would not recognize.
p181
aa(lp182
VLN: Oh my God, I want a pet rabbit-camel.
p183
aa(lp184
V(Audio) NR: I know, wouldn't that be great?
p185
aa(lp186
V(Laughter)
p187
aa(lp188
VLN: And then about three to seven million years ago,
p189
aVone branch of camels went down to South America,
p190
aVwhere they became llamas and alpacas,
p191
aVand another branch crossed over the Bering Land Bridge
p192
aVinto Asia and Africa.
p193
aVAnd then around the end of the last ice age,
p194
aVNorth American camels went extinct.
p195
aa(lp196
VSo, scientists knew all of that already,
p197
aVbut it still doesn't fully explain how Natalia found one so far north.
p198
aVLike, this is, temperature-wise, the polar opposite of the Sahara.
p199
aVNow to be fair,
p200
aVthree and a half million years ago,
p201
aVit was on average 22 degrees Celsius warmer than it is now.
p202
aVSo it would have been boreal forest,
p203
aVso more like the Yukon or Siberia today.
p204
aVBut still, like, they would have six-month-long winters
p205
aVwhere the ponds would freeze over.
p206
aVYou'd have blizzards.
p207
aVYou'd have 24 hours a day of straight darkness.
p208
aVLike, how ... How?
p209
aVHow is it that one of these Saharan superstars
p210
aVcould ever have survived those arctic conditions?
p211
aa(lp212
V(Laughter)
p213
aa(lp214
VNatalia and her colleagues think they have an answer.
p215
aVAnd it's kind of brilliant.
p216
aVWhat if the very features that we imagine make the camel so well-suited
p217
aVto places like the Sahara,
p218
aVactually evolved to help it get through the winter?
p219
aVWhat if those broad feet were meant to tromp not over sand,
p220
aVbut over snow, like a pair of snowshoes?
p221
aVWhat if that hump \u2014 which, huge news to me,
p222
aVdoes not contain water, it contains fat \u2014
p223
aa(lp224
V(Laughter)
p225
aa(lp226
Vwas there to help the camel get through that six-month-long winter,
p227
aVwhen food was scarce?
p228
aVAnd then, only later, long after it crossed over the land bridge
p229
aVdid it retrofit those winter features for a hot desert environment?
p230
aVLike, for instance, the hump may be helpful to camels in hotter climes
p231
aVbecause having all your fat in one place,
p232
aVlike a, you know, fat backpack,
p233
aVmeans that you don't have to have that insulation
p234
aVall over the rest of your body.
p235
aVSo it helps heat dissipate easier.
p236
aVIt's this crazy idea,
p237
aVthat what seems like proof of the camel's quintessential desert nature
p238
aVcould actually be proof of its High Arctic past.
p239
aa(lp240
VNow, I'm not the first person to tell this story.
p241
aVOthers have told it as a way to marvel at evolutionary biology
p242
aVor as a keyhole into the future of climate change.
p243
aVBut I love it for a totally different reason.
p244
aVFor me, it's a story about us,
p245
aVabout how we see the world
p246
aVand about how that changes.
p247
aa(lp248
VSo I was trained as a historian.
p249
aVAnd I've learned that, actually, a lot of scientists are historians, too.
p250
aVThey make sense of the past.
p251
aVThey tell the history of our universe, of our planet, of life on this planet.
p252
aVAnd as a historian,
p253
aVyou start with an idea in your mind of how the story goes.
p254
aa(lp255
V(Audio) NR: We make up stories and we stick with it,
p256
aVlike the camel in the desert, right?
p257
aVThat's a great story! It's totally adapted for that.
p258
aVClearly, it always lived there.
p259
aa(lp260
VLN: But at any moment, you could uncover some tiny bit of evidence.
p261
aVYou could learn some tiny thing
p262
aVthat forces you to reframe everything you thought you knew.
p263
aVLike, in this case, this one scientist finds this one shard
p264
aVof what she thought was wood,
p265
aVand because of that, science has a totally new and totally counterintuitive theory
p266
aVabout why this absurd Dr. Seuss-looking creature
p267
aVlooks the way it does.
p268
aVAnd for me, it completely upended the way I think of the camel.
p269
aVIt went from being this ridiculously niche creature
p270
aVsuited only to this one specific environment,
p271
aVto being this world traveler that just happens to be in the Sahara,
p272
aVand could end up virtually anywhere.
p273
aa(lp274
V(Applause)
p275
aa(lp276
VThis is Azuri.
p277
aVAzuri, hi, how are you doing?
p278
aVOK, here, I've got one of these for you here.
p279
aa(lp280
V(Laughter)
p281
aa(lp282
VSo Azuri is on a break from her regular gig
p283
aVat the Radio City Music Hall.
p284
aa(lp285
V(Laughter)
p286
aa(lp287
VThat's not even a joke.
p288
aVAnyway \u2014
p289
aa(lp290
VBut really, Azuri is here as a living reminder
p291
aVthat the story of our world is a dynamic one.
p292
aVIt requires our willingness to readjust, to reimagine.
p293
aa(lp294
V(Laughter)
p295
aa(lp296
VRight, Azuri?
p297
aa(lp298
VAnd, really, that we're all just one shard of bone away
p299
aVfrom seeing the world anew.
p300
aa(lp301
VThank you very much.
