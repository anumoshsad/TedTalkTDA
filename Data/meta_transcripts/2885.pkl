VSo, I had been a photographer
p4
aVfor 18 years
p5
aVbefore I began the Microsculpture Project.
p6
aVAnd in that time, I had shot global ad campaigns,
p7
aVI had the opportunity to photograph some of my generation's icons,
p8
aVand I was traveling the world.
p9
aVI got to a point in my career that I dreamed of getting to,
p10
aVand yet, for some reason, I still felt a little bit unfulfilled.
p11
aVDespite the extraordinary things I was shooting and experiencing,
p12
aVthey'd started to feel a little bit ordinary to me.
p13
aVI was also getting concerned
p14
aVabout how disposable photography had started to feel in the digital world,
p15
aVand I really wanted to produce images that had a sense of worth again.
p16
aVAnd I needed a subject that felt extraordinary.
p17
aa(lp18
VSometimes I wish I had the eyes of a child.
p19
aVAnd by that I mean, I wish I could look at the world
p20
aVin the same as I did when I was a small boy.
p21
aVI think there is a danger, as we get older,
p22
aVthat our curiosity becomes slightly muted or dulled by familiarity.
p23
aVAnd as a visual creator, one of the challenges for me
p24
aVis to present the familiar in a new and engaging way.
p25
aa(lp26
VFortunately for me, though, I've got two great kids
p27
aVwho are still curious about the world.
p28
aVSebastian \u2014 he's still curious about the world, and in 2014, in spring,
p29
aVhe brought in a ground beetle from the garden.
p30
aVThere was nothing particularly special about this insect \u2014
p31
aVyou know, it was a common species.
p32
aVBut he was still curious,
p33
aVand he brought it up to my office,
p34
aVand we decided to look at it under his microscope.
p35
aVHe had a little science kit for Christmas.
p36
aVAnd this is what we saw.
p37
aa(lp38
VNow, when I first saw this, it blew me away.
p39
aVUp here \u2014 this is the back of the ground beetle.
p40
aVWhen I first saw it, it reminded me of a galaxy.
p41
aVAnd all the time, this had just been outside our window.
p42
aVYou know, I was looking for this extraordinary subject,
p43
aVand it took Seb's eyes and curiosity to bring it in to me.
p44
aa(lp45
VSo I decided to photograph it for him, and this is what I produced.
p46
aVI basically asked myself two simple questions.
p47
aVThe first one:
p48
aVCould I take all my knowledge and skill of photographic lighting
p49
aVand take that onto a subject that's five millimeters long?
p50
aVBut also: Could I keep creative control over that lighting
p51
aVon a subject that size?
p52
aVSo I practiced on some other found specimens,
p53
aVand I approached the Oxford University Museum of Natural History
p54
aVto see if I could have access to their collection,
p55
aVto progress the project.
p56
aVAnd I went up there for a meeting,
p57
aVand I showed them some of the images that I'd been shooting,
p58
aVand they could see the kind of detail I was able to get.
p59
aVI don't think they'd ever really seen anything quite like it before,
p60
aVand from that point forward, they gave me open access
p61
aVto their entire collection
p62
aVand the assistance of Dr. James Hogan, their entomologist.
p63
aa(lp64
VNow, over the next two-and-a-half years,
p65
aVI shot 37 insects from their collection.
p66
aVAnd the way I work
p67
aVis that I essentially split the insect up into multiple sections,
p68
aVand I treat each one of those sections like a small still life.
p69
aVSo for example, if I was photographing the eye of the insect,
p70
aVwhich is normally quite smooth and dome-shaped,
p71
aVthen I'd use a light source that is large and soft and diffuse,
p72
aVso I don't get any harsh hot spots on that surface.
p73
aVBut once my attention turns over to a hairy leg,
p74
aVthat lighting setup will change completely.
p75
aVAnd so I make that one tiny section look as beautiful as I possibly can,
p76
aVand I work my way across the insect
p77
aVuntil I have about 20 or 25 different sections.
p78
aa(lp79
VThe issue with photography at high magnification
p80
aVis that there is inherently a very shallow depth of field.
p81
aVSo to get around that, what I do is,
p82
aVI put my camera on a rail
p83
aVthat I can automate to move 10 microns in between each shot.
p84
aVThat's about one-seventh the width of a human hair.
p85
aVAnd then that provides me with a deep stack of images.
p86
aVEach has a tiny sliver of focus all the way through.
p87
aVAnd I can squash that down
p88
aVto produce one image that is fully focused from front to back.
p89
aVSo essentially, that gives me 25 sections that are fully focused
p90
aVand beautifully lit.
p91
aVNow, each one of my images
p92
aVis made up of anywhere between 8- and 10,000 separate shots.
p93
aVThey take about three-and-a-half weeks to create,
p94
aVand the file sizes on average are about four gigabytes.
p95
aVSo I've got plenty of information to play with when I'm printing.
p96
aVAnd the prints at the exhibition are around the three-meter mark.
p97
aVIn fact, I had a show in Milan two weeks ago,
p98
aVand we had some prints there that were nine meters long.
p99
aa(lp100
VBut, you know, I realize
p101
aVthat these images still have to work in the digital world.
p102
aVThere's no point in me putting all my blood, sweat and tears
p103
aVinto these pictures
p104
aVif they're only going to be showing 500 pixels on a screen.
p105
aVSo with the help of Rob Chandler and Will Cookson,
p106
aVwe developed a website
p107
aVthat enables the viewer to immerse themselves
p108
aVinto the full four-gigabyte files,
p109
aVand they can explore all that microscopic detail.
p110
aVSo if you have the time, and I encourage you,
p111
aVplease visit microsculpture.net
p112
aVand go and have a play.
p113
aVIt's good fun.
p114
aa(lp115
VI first showed the work at Oxford,
p116
aVand since then, it's moved on to the Middle East.
p117
aVIt's now back in Europe and goes to Copenhagen this month.
p118
aVAnd the feedback has been great.
p119
aVYou know, I get emails, actually, from all over the world \u2014
p120
aVfrom teachers, at the moment, who are using the website in school.
p121
aVThe kids are using them on the tablet.
p122
aVThey're zooming into the pictures
p123
aVand using it for art class, biology class.
p124
aVAnd that's not something I planned.
p125
aVThat's just a beautiful offshoot of the project.
p126
aVIn fact, one of the things I like to do at the exhibitions
p127
aVis actually look at the kiddies' reactions.
p128
aVAnd, you know, standing in front of a three-meter insect,
p129
aVthey could have been horrified.
p130
aVBut they're not. They look in wonder.
p131
aVThis little chap here, he stood there for five minutes, motionless.
p132
aa(lp133
V(Laughter)
p134
aa(lp135
VAnd at the end of the day, actually, at the end of the day at the exhibitions,
p136
aVwe have to wipe down the lower third of the big prints \u2014
p137
aV(Laughter)
p138
aVjust to remove all those sticky handprints,
p139
aVbecause all they want to do is touch those big bugs.
p140
aa(lp141
VI do want to leave you with one final image, if that's OK.
p142
aVThis has to do with Charles Darwin.
p143
aVOne of the recent images that I photographed
p144
aVwas this one here.
p145
aVI'm talking about the creature in the box, not my cat.
p146
aVAnd this is a shield bug
p147
aVthat Charles Darwin brought back from Australia
p148
aVon the HMS Beagle in 1836.
p149
aVAnd when I got it home,
p150
aVI stood in my kitchen and stared at it for about 20 minutes.
p151
aVI couldn't believe I was in possession of this beautiful creature.
p152
aVAnd at that moment, I kind of realized
p153
aVthat this validated the project for me.
p154
aVThe fact that the museum was willing to risk me playing with this
p155
aVkind of showed me that my images had worth \u2014
p156
aVyou know, they weren't disposable.
p157
aa(lp158
VThat's the image that I produced.
p159
aVI often wonder, still, when I look at this:
p160
aVWhat would Charles Darwin make of these images?
p161
aVDo you think he'd like his picture of his shield bug? I hope so.
p162
aa(lp163
VSo \u2014
p164
aa(lp165
V(Applause)
p166
aa(lp167
VYou know, I think it's strange in a way.
p168
aVI'm a visual person, I'm a creative person,
p169
aVbut I still needed the eyes of a child to find my extraordinary subject.
p170
aVThat's the way it was.
p171
aVSo all I can say is, thank you very much, Sebastian;
p172
aVI am very, very grateful.
p173
aa(lp174
VThank you.
