VThank you.
p4
aVI have only got 18 minutes
p5
aVto explain something  that lasts for hours and days,
p6
aVso I'd better get started.
p7
aVLet's start with a clip from Al Jazeera's Listening Post.
p8
aa(lp9
VRichard Gizbert: Norway is a country that  gets relatively little media coverage.
p10
aVEven the elections this past week passed without much drama.
p11
aVAnd that's the Norwegian media in a nutshell:
p12
aVnot much drama.
p13
aVA few years back,
p14
aVNorway's public TV channel NRK
p15
aVdecided to broadcast live coverage of a seven-hour train ride \u2014
p16
aVseven hours of simple footage,
p17
aVa train rolling down the tracks.
p18
aVNorwegians, more than a million of them according to the ratings, loved it.
p19
aVA new kind of reality TV show was born,
p20
aVand it goes against all the rules of TV engagement.
p21
aVThere is no story line, no script,
p22
aVno drama, no climax,
p23
aVand it's called Slow TV.
p24
aVFor the past two months,
p25
aVNorwegians have been watching  a cruise ship's journey up the coast,
p26
aVand there's a lot of fog on that coast.
p27
aVExecutives at Norway's National Broadcasting Service
p28
aVare now considering broadcasting a night of knitting nationwide.
p29
aVOn the surface, it sounds boring,
p30
aVbecause it is,
p31
aVbut something about this TV experiment
p32
aVhas gripped Norwegians.
p33
aVSo we sent the Listening Post's Marcela Pizarro to Oslo
p34
aVto find out what it is, but first a warning:
p35
aVViewers may find some of the images in the following report disappointing.
p36
aV(Laughter)
p37
aa(lp38
VThomas Hellum: And then follows an eight-minute story on Al Jazeera
p39
aVabout some strange TV programs in little Norway.
p40
aVAl Jazeera. CNN. How did we get there?
p41
aVWe have to go back to 2009,
p42
aVwhen one of my colleagues got a great idea.
p43
aVWhere do you get your ideas?
p44
aVIn the lunchroom.
p45
aVSo he said, why don't we make a radio program
p46
aVmarking the day of the German invasion of Norway in 1940.
p47
aVWe tell the story at the exact time during the night.
p48
aVWow. Brilliant idea, except
p49
aVthis was just a couple of weeks before the invasion day.
p50
aVSo we sat in our lunchroom and discussed
p51
aVwhat other stories can you tell as they evolve?
p52
aVWhat other things take a really long time?
p53
aa(lp54
VSo one of us came up with a train.
p55
aVThe Bergen Railway had its  100-year anniversary that year
p56
aVIt goes from western Norway to eastern Norway,
p57
aVand it takes exactly the same time as it did 40 years ago,
p58
aVover seven hours. (Laughter)
p59
aVSo we caught our commissioning editors  in Oslo, and we said,
p60
aVwe want to make a documentary about the Bergen Railway,
p61
aVand we want to make it in full length,
p62
aVand the answer was,
p63
aV"Yes, but how long will the program be?"
p64
aV"Oh," we said, "full length."
p65
aV"Yes, but we mean the program."
p66
aVAnd back and forth.
p67
aa(lp68
VLuckily for us, they met us with laughter, very, very good laughter,
p69
aVso one bright day in September,
p70
aVwe started a program that we thought should be seven hours and four minutes.
p71
aVActually, it turned out to be seven hours and 14 minutes
p72
aVdue to a signal failure at the last station.
p73
aVWe had four cameras,
p74
aVthree of them pointing out to the beautiful nature.
p75
aVSome talking to the guests, some information.
p76
aV(Video) Train announcement:  We will arrive at Haugastøl Station.
p77
aVTH: And that's about it,
p78
aVbut of course, also
p79
aVthe 160 tunnels gave us the opportunity to do some archives.
p80
aVNarrator [in Norwegian]: Then a bit of flirting while the food is digested.
p81
aVThe last downhill stretch before we reach our destination.
p82
aVWe pass Mjølfjell Station.
p83
aVThen a new tunnel.
p84
aV(Laughter)
p85
aVTH: And now we thought, yes, we have a brilliant program.
p86
aVIt will fit for the 2,000 train spotters in Norway.
p87
aVWe brought it on air in November 2009.
p88
aVBut no, this was far more attractive.
p89
aVThis is the five biggest TV channels in Norway on a normal Friday,
p90
aVand if you look at NRK2 over here,
p91
aVlook what happened when they put on the Bergen Railway show:
p92
aV1.2 million Norwegians watched part of this program.
p93
aV(Applause)
p94
aVAnd another funny thing:
p95
aVWhen the host on our main channel,
p96
aVafter they have got news for you,
p97
aVshe said, "And on our second channel,
p98
aVthe train has now nearly reached Myrdal station."
p99
aVThousands of people just jumped on the train
p100
aVon our second channel like this. (Laughter)
p101
aVThis was also a huge success in terms of social media.
p102
aVIt was so nice to see all the thousands of Facebook and Twitter users
p103
aVdiscussing the same view,
p104
aVtalking to each other as if they were on the same train together.
p105
aVAnd especially, I like this one. It's a 76-year-old man.
p106
aVHe's watched all the program,
p107
aVand at the end station, he rises up to pick up what he thinks is his luggage,
p108
aVand his head hit the curtain rod,
p109
aVand he realized he is in his own living room.
p110
aV(Applause)
p111
aa(lp112
VSo that's strong and living TV.
p113
aVFour hundred and thirty-six minute by minute on a Friday night,
p114
aVand during that first night,
p115
aVthe first Twitter message came: Why be a chicken?
p116
aVWhy stop at 436 when you can expand that
p117
aVto 8,040, minute by minute,
p118
aVand do the iconic journey in Norway,
p119
aVthe coastal ship journey Hurtigruten from Bergen to Kirkenes,
p120
aValmost 3,000 kilometers, covering most of our coast.
p121
aVIt has 120-year-old, very interesting history,
p122
aVand literally takes part in life and death along the coast.
p123
aVSo just a week after the Bergen Railway,
p124
aVwe called the Hurtigruten company and we started planning for our next show.
p125
aa(lp126
VWe wanted to do something different.
p127
aVThe Bergen Railway was a recorded program.
p128
aVSo when we sat in our editing room,
p129
aVwe watched this picture \u2014 it's all Ål Station \u2014
p130
aVwe saw this journalist.
p131
aVWe had called him, we had spoken to him,
p132
aVand when we left the station,
p133
aVhe took this picture of us and he waved to the camera,
p134
aVand we thought,
p135
aVwhat if more people knew that we were on board that train?
p136
aVWould more people show up?
p137
aVWhat would it look like?
p138
aVSo we decided our next project, it should be live.
p139
aVWe wanted this picture of us on the fjord and on the screen at the same time.
p140
aa(lp141
VSo this is not the first time NRK had been on board a ship.
p142
aVThis is back in 1964,
p143
aVwhen the technical managers have suits and ties
p144
aVand NRK rolled all its equipment on board a ship,
p145
aVand 200 meters out of the shore, transmitting the signal back,
p146
aVand in the machine room, they talked to the machine guy,
p147
aVand on the deck, they have splendid entertainment.
p148
aVSo being on a ship,  it's not the first time.
p149
aVBut five and a half days in a row, and live, we wanted some help.
p150
aVAnd we asked our viewers out there, what do you want to see?
p151
aVWhat do you want us to film? How do you want this to look?
p152
aVDo you want us to make a website? What do you want on it?
p153
aVAnd we got some answers from you out there,
p154
aVand it helped us a very lot to build the program.
p155
aVSo in June 2011,
p156
aV23 of us went on board the Hurtigruten coastal ship
p157
aVand we set off.
p158
aV(Music)
p159
aa(lp160
VI have some really strong memories from that week, and it's all about people.
p161
aVThis guy, for instance,
p162
aVhe's head of research at the University in Tromsø
p163
aV(Laughter)
p164
aVAnd I will show you a piece of cloth,
p165
aVthis one.
p166
aVIt's the other strong memory.
p167
aVIt belongs to a guy called Erik Hansen.
p168
aVAnd it's people like those two who took a firm grip of our program,
p169
aVand together with thousands of others along the route,
p170
aVthey made the program what it became.
p171
aVThey made all the stories.
p172
aVThis is Karl. He's in the ninth grade.
p173
aVIt says, "I will be a little late for school tomorrow."
p174
aVHe was supposed to be in the school at 8 a.m.
p175
aVHe came at 9 a.m., and he didn't get a note from his teacher,
p176
aVbecause the teacher had watched the program.
p177
aV(Laughter)
p178
aa(lp179
VHow did we do this?
p180
aVYes, we took a conference room on board the Hurtigruten.
p181
aVWe turned it into a complete TV control room.
p182
aVWe made it all work, of course,
p183
aVand then we took along 11 cameras.
p184
aVThis is one of them.
p185
aVThis is my sketch from February,
p186
aVand when you give this sketch to professional people
p187
aVin the Norwegian broadcasting company NRK,
p188
aVyou get some cool stuff back.
p189
aVAnd with some very creative solutions.
p190
aa(lp191
V(Video) Narrator [in Norwegian]:  Run it up and down.
p192
aVThis is Norway's most important drill right now.
p193
aVIt regulates the height of a bow camera in NRK's live production,
p194
aVone of 11 that capture great shots from the MS Nord-Norge.
p195
aVEight wires keep the camera stable.
p196
aVCameraman: I work  on different camera solutions.
p197
aVThey're just tools used in a different context.
p198
aa(lp199
VTH: Another camera is this one. It's normally used for sports.
p200
aVIt made it possible for us to take close-up pictures of people
p201
aV100 kilomteres away,
p202
aVlike this one. (Laughter)
p203
aVPeople called us and asked, how is this man doing?
p204
aVHe's doing fine. Everything went well.
p205
aVWe also could take pictures of people waving at us,
p206
aVpeople along the route, thousands of them,
p207
aVand they all had a phone in their hand.
p208
aVAnd when you take a picture of them, and they get the message,
p209
aV"Now we are on TV, dad," they start waving back.
p210
aVThis was waving TV  for five and a half days,
p211
aVand people get so extremely happy
p212
aVwhen they can send a warm message to their loved ones.
p213
aa(lp214
VIt was also a great success on social media.
p215
aVOn the last day, we met Her Majesty the Queen of Norway,
p216
aVand Twitter couldn't quite handle it.
p217
aVAnd we also, on the web,
p218
aVduring this week we streamed more than 100 years of video
p219
aVto 148 nations,
p220
aVand the websites are still there and they will be forever, actually,
p221
aVbecause Hurtigruten was selected
p222
aVto be part of the Norwegian UNESCO list of documents,
p223
aVand it's also in the Guinness Book of Records
p224
aVas the longest documentary ever.
p225
aV(Applause)
p226
aVThank you.
p227
aa(lp228
VBut it's a long program,
p229
aVso some watched part of it, like the Prime Minister.
p230
aVSome watched a little bit more.
p231
aVIt says, "I haven't used my bed for five days."
p232
aVAnd he's 82 years old, and he hardly slept.
p233
aVHe kept watching because something might happen,
p234
aVthough it probably won't. (Laughter)
p235
aVThis is the number of viewers along the route.
p236
aVYou can see the famous Trollfjord
p237
aVand a day after, all-time high for NRK2.
p238
aVIf you see the four biggest channels in Norway during June 2011,
p239
aVthey will look like this,
p240
aVand as a TV producer, it's a pleasure to put Hurtigruten on top of it.
p241
aVIt looks like this:
p242
aV3.2 million Norwegians watched part of this program,
p243
aVand we are only five million here.
p244
aVEven the passengers on board the Hurtigruten coastal ship \u2014
p245
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p246
aVthey chose to watched the telly instead of turning 90 degrees
p247
aVand watching out the window.
p248
aa(lp249
VSo we were allowed to be  part of people's living room
p250
aVwith this strange TV program,
p251
aVwith music, nature, people.
p252
aVAnd Slow TV was now a buzzword,
p253
aVand we started looking for other things we could make Slow TV about.
p254
aVSo we could either take something long and make it a topic,
p255
aVlike with the railway and the Hurtigruten,
p256
aVor we could take a topic and make it long.
p257
aVThis is the last project. It's the peep show.
p258
aVIt's 14 hours of birdwatching on a TV screen,
p259
aVactually 87 days on the web.
p260
aVWe have made 18 hours of live salmon fishing.
p261
aVIt actually took three hours before we got the first fish,
p262
aVand that's quite slow.
p263
aVWe have made 12 hours of boat ride into the beautiful Telemark Canal,
p264
aVand we have made another train ride with the northern railway,
p265
aVand because this we couldn't do live, we did it in four seasons
p266
aVjust to give the viewer another experience on the way.
p267
aa(lp268
VSo our next project got us some attention outside Norway.
p269
aVThis is from the Colbert Report on Comedy Central.
p270
aa(lp271
V(Video) Stephen Colbert: I've got my eye on a wildly popular program from Norway
p272
aVcalled "National Firewood Night,"
p273
aVwhich consisted of mostly people in parkas chatting and chopping in the woods,
p274
aVand then eight hours of a fire  burning in a fireplace. (Laughter)
p275
aVIt destroyed the other  top Norwegian shows,
p276
aVlike "So You Think You Can Watch Paint Dry"
p277
aVand "The Amazing Glacier Race."
p278
aVAnd get this, almost 20 percent of the Norwegian population tuned in,
p279
aV20 percent.
p280
aa(lp281
VTH: So, when wood fire and wood chopping can be that interesting,
p282
aVwhy not knitting?
p283
aVSo on our next project,
p284
aVwe used more than eight hours to go live from a sheep to a sweater,
p285
aVand Jimmy Kimmel in the ABC show,
p286
aVhe liked that.
p287
aa(lp288
V(Music)
p289
aa(lp290
V(Video) Jimmy Kimmel: Even the people on the show are falling asleep,
p291
aVand after all that, the knitters actually failed
p292
aVto break the world record.
p293
aVThey did not succeed,
p294
aVbut remember the old Norwegian saying,
p295
aVit's not whether you win or lose that counts.
p296
aVIn fact, nothing counts,  and death is coming for us all.
p297
aV(Laughter)
p298
aa(lp299
VTH: Exactly. So why does this stand out?
p300
aVThis is so completely different to other TV programming.
p301
aVWe take the viewer on a journey that happens right now in real time,
p302
aVand the viewer gets the feeling of actually being there,
p303
aVactually being on the train, on the boat,
p304
aVand knitting together with others,
p305
aVand the reason I think why they're doing that
p306
aVis because we don't edit the timeline.
p307
aVIt's important that we don't edit the timeline,
p308
aVand it's also important that what we make Slow TV about
p309
aVis something that we all can relate to, that the viewer can relate to,
p310
aVand that somehow has  a root in our culture.
p311
aVThis is a picture from last summer
p312
aVwhen we traveled the coast again for seven weeks.
p313
aVAnd of course this is a lot of planning, this is a lot of logistics.
p314
aVSo this is the working plan for 150 people last summer,
p315
aVbut more important is what you don't plan.
p316
aVYou don't plan what's going to happen.
p317
aVYou have to just take your cameras with you.
p318
aVIt's like a sports event.
p319
aVYou rig them and you see what's happening.
p320
aVSo this is actually the whole running order
p321
aVfor Hurtigruten, 134 hours, just written on one page.
p322
aVWe didn't know anything more when we left Bergen.
p323
aa(lp324
VSo you have to let the viewers make the stories themselves,
p325
aVand I'll give you an example of that.
p326
aVThis is from last summer,
p327
aVand as a TV producer,
p328
aVit's a nice picture, but now you can cut to the next one.
p329
aVBut this is Slow TV,
p330
aVso you have to keep this picture until  it really starts hurting your stomach,
p331
aVand then you keep it a little bit longer,
p332
aVand when you keep it that long,
p333
aVI'm sure some of you now have noticed the cow.
p334
aVSome of you have seen the flag.
p335
aVSome of you start wondering, is the farmer at home?
p336
aVHas he left? Is he watching the cow?
p337
aVAnd where is that cow going?
p338
aVSo my point is, the longer you keep a picture like this,
p339
aVand we kept it for 10 minutes,
p340
aVyou start making the stories in your own head.
p341
aVThat's Slow TV.
p342
aa(lp343
VSo we think that Slow TV is one nice way of telling a TV story,
p344
aVand we think that we can continue doing it,
p345
aVnot too often, once or twice a year, so we keep the feeling of an event,
p346
aVand we also think that the good Slow TV idea,
p347
aVthat's the idea when people say,
p348
aV"Oh no, you can't put that on TV."
p349
aVWhen people smile, it might be a very good slow idea,
p350
aVso after all, life is best when it's a bit strange.
p351
aa(lp352
VThank you.
