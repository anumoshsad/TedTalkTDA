VPeople love their automobiles.
p4
aVThey allow us to go where we want to when we want to.
p5
aVThey're a form of entertainment,
p6
aVthey're a form of art,
p7
aVa pride of ownership.
p8
aVSongs are written about cars.
p9
aVPrince wrote a great song: "Little Red Corvette."
p10
aVHe didn't write "Little Red Laptop Computer" or "Little Red Dirt Devil."
p11
aVHe wrote about a car.
p12
aVOne of my favorites has always been:
p13
aV"Make Love to Your Man in a Chevy Van,"
p14
aVbecause that was my vehicle when I was in college.
p15
aa(lp16
VThe fact is, when we do our market research around the world,
p17
aVwe see there's a nearly universal aspiration on the part of people
p18
aVto own an automobile \u2014
p19
aV750 million people in the world today own a car.
p20
aVAnd you say, boy, that's a lot.
p21
aVBut you know what?
p22
aVThat's just 12 percent of the population.
p23
aVWe really have to ask the question:
p24
aVCan the world sustain that number of automobiles?
p25
aVAnd if you look at projections over the next 10 to 15 to 20 years,
p26
aVit looks like the world car park could grow
p27
aVto on the order of 1.1 billion vehicles.
p28
aVIf you park those end to end and wrap them around the Earth,
p29
aVthat would stretch around the Earth 125 times.
p30
aa(lp31
VNow, we've made great progress with automobile technology
p32
aVover the last 100 years.
p33
aVCars are dramatically cleaner, dramatically safer, more efficient
p34
aVand radically more affordable than they were 100 years ago.
p35
aVBut the fact remains:
p36
aVthe fundamental DNA of the automobile has stayed pretty much the same.
p37
aVIf we were to reinvent the automobile today, rather than 100 years ago,
p38
aVknowing what we know about the issues associated with our product
p39
aVand about the technologies that exist today,
p40
aVwhat would we do?
p41
aa(lp42
VWe wanted something that was really affordable.
p43
aVThe fuel cell looked great:
p44
aVone-tenth as many moving parts,
p45
aVa fuel-cell propulsion system as an internal combustion engine,
p46
aVand it emits just water.
p47
aVAnd we wanted to take advantage of Moore's Law
p48
aVwith electronic controls and software,
p49
aVand we absolutely wanted our car to be connected.
p50
aVSo we embarked upon the reinvention around an electrochemical engine,
p51
aVthe fuel cell,
p52
aVand hydrogen as the energy carrier.
p53
aVFirst was Autonomy.
p54
aVAutonomy really set the vision for where we wanted to head.
p55
aVWe embodied all of the key components of a fuel-cell propulsion system.
p56
aVWe then had Autonomy drivable with Hy-Wire,
p57
aVand we showed Hy-Wire here at this conference last year.
p58
aVHy-Wire is the world's first drivable fuel cell,
p59
aVand we have followed up that now with Sequel.
p60
aVAnd Sequel truly is a real car.
p61
aVSo if we could run the video \u2014
p62
aa(lp63
V(Futuristic music)
p64
aa(lp65
V[Reinventing the Automobile]
p66
aa(lp67
V(Video) It truly is my great pleasure to introduce Sequel.
p68
aa(lp69
V[Acceleration]
p70
aa(lp71
V[Cruising]
p72
aa(lp73
V[Steering]
p74
aa(lp75
V[Braking]
p76
aa(lp77
VBut the real key question I'm sure that's on your mind:
p78
aVWhere is the hydrogen going to come from?
p79
aVAnd secondly, when are these kinds of cars going to be available?
p80
aVSo let me talk about hydrogen first.
p81
aVThe beauty of hydrogen is it can come from so many different sources:
p82
aVit can come from fossil fuels,
p83
aVit can come from any way that you can create electricity,
p84
aVincluding renewables.
p85
aVAnd it can come from biofuels.
p86
aVAnd that's quite exciting.
p87
aVThe vision here is to have each local community play to its natural strength
p88
aVin creating the hydrogen.
p89
aVA lot of hydrogen is produced today in the world.
p90
aVIt's produced to get sulfur out of gasoline \u2014
p91
aVwhich I find is somewhat ironic.
p92
aVIt's produced in the fertilizer industry;
p93
aVit's produced in the chemical manufacturing industry.
p94
aVThat hydrogen is being made
p95
aVbecause there's a good business reason for its use.
p96
aVBut it tells us that we know how to create it,
p97
aVwe know how to create it cost-effectively,
p98
aVwe know how to handle it safely.
p99
aa(lp100
VWe did an analysis
p101
aVwhere you would have a station in each city
p102
aVwith each of the 100 largest cities in the United States,
p103
aVand located the stations
p104
aVso you'd be no more than two miles from a station at any time.
p105
aVWe put one every 25 miles on the freeway,
p106
aVand it turns out that translates into about 12,000 stations.
p107
aVAnd at a million dollars each, that would be about 12 billion dollars.
p108
aVThat's a lot of money.
p109
aVBut if you built the Alaskan pipeline today,
p110
aVthat's half of what the Alaskan pipeline would cost.
p111
aVBut the real exciting vision that we see, truly, is home refueling,
p112
aVmuch like recharging your laptop or recharging your cell phone.
p113
aVSo we're pretty excited about the future of hydrogen.
p114
aVWe think it's a question of not whether, but a question of when.
p115
aa(lp116
VWhat we've targeted for ourselves \u2014
p117
aVand we're making great progress toward this goal \u2014
p118
aVis to have a propulsion system based on hydrogen and fuel cells,
p119
aVdesigned and validated,
p120
aVthat can go head-to-head with the internal combustion engine.
p121
aVWe're talking about obsoleting the internal combustion engine,
p122
aVand doing it in terms of affordability at scale volumes,
p123
aVits performance and its durability.
p124
aVSo that's what we're driving to for 2010.
p125
aVWe haven't seen anything yet in our development work
p126
aVthat says that isn't possible.
p127
aVWe actually think the future is going to be event-driven.
p128
aVSo since we can't predict the future,
p129
aVwe want to spend a lot of our time trying to create that future.
p130
aa(lp131
VI'm very, very intrigued
p132
aVby the fact that our cars and trucks sit idle 90 percent of the time:
p133
aVthey're parked all around us.
p134
aVThey're usually parked within 100 feet of the people that own them.
p135
aVNow, if you take the power-generating capability of an automobile
p136
aVand you compare that to the electric grid in the United States,
p137
aVit turns out that the power in four percent of the automobiles
p138
aVequals that of the electric grid of the US.
p139
aVThat's a huge power-generating capability,
p140
aVa mobile power-generating capability.
p141
aVAnd hydrogen and fuel cells give us that opportunity
p142
aVto actually use our cars and trucks when they're parked
p143
aVto generate electricity for the grid.
p144
aa(lp145
VWe talked about swarm networks earlier.
p146
aVTalk about the ultimate swarm \u2014 having all of the processors
p147
aVand all of the cars when they're sitting idle
p148
aVbeing part of a global grid for computing capability.
p149
aVWe find that premise quite exciting.
p150
aVThe automobile becomes, then, an appliance \u2014
p151
aVnot in a commodity sense,
p152
aVbut an appliance, mobile power, mobile platform
p153
aVfor information and computing and communication,
p154
aVas well as a form of transportation.
p155
aa(lp156
VAnd the key to all of this is to make it affordable,
p157
aVto make it exciting,
p158
aVto get it on a pathway where there's a way to make money doing it.
p159
aVAnd again, this is a pretty big march to take here.
p160
aVA lot of people say:
p161
aVHow do you sleep at night
p162
aVwhen you're wrestling with a problem of that magnitude?
p163
aVI tell them I sleep like a baby: I wake up crying every two hours.
p164
aa(lp165
V(Laughter)
p166
aa(lp167
VActually, the theme of this conference, I think,
p168
aVhas hit on one of the major keys to pull that off,
p169
aVand that's relationships and working together.
p170
aVThank you very much.
p171
aa(lp172
V(Applause)
p173
aa(lp174
VChris Anderson: Larry, Larry \u2014 wait, wait, wait. Larry, wait one sec.
p175
aVI've got so many questions I could ask you.
p176
aVI just want to ask one.
p177
aVYou know, I could be wrong about this,
p178
aVbut my sense is that in the public mind today,
p179
aVGM is not viewed as as serious about some of these environmental ideas
p180
aVas some of your Japanese competitors, maybe even as Ford.
p181
aVAre you serious about it,
p182
aVand not just, you know, when the consumers want it,
p183
aVwhen the regulators force us to do it, we will go there?
p184
aVWill you guys really try and show leadership on this?
p185
aa(lp186
VLarry Burns: Absolutely. We're absolutely serious.
p187
aVWe're into this over a billion dollars already,
p188
aVso I would hope people would think we're serious
p189
aVwhen we're spending that kind of money.
p190
aVAnd secondly, it's a fundamental business proposition.
p191
aVI'll be honest with you;
p192
aVwe're into it for business growth opportunities.
p193
aVWe can't grow our business unless we solve these problems.
p194
aVThe growth of the auto industry will be capped by sustainability issues
p195
aVif we don't solve the problems.
p196
aVAnd there's a simple principle of strategy that says:
p197
aVDo unto yourself before others do unto you.
p198
aVIf we can see this possible future, others can, too.
p199
aVAnd we want to be the first one to create it, Chris.
