VSo I'm going to talk about trust,
p4
aVand I'm going to start by reminding you
p5
aVof the standard views that people have about trust.
p6
aVI think these are so commonplace,
p7
aVthey've become clichés of our society.
p8
aVAnd I think there are three.
p9
aVOne's a claim: there has been a great decline in trust,
p10
aVvery widely believed.
p11
aVThe second is an aim: we should have more trust.
p12
aVAnd the third is a task: we should rebuild trust.
p13
aa(lp14
VI think that the claim, the aim and the task
p15
aVare all misconceived.
p16
aVSo what I'm going to try to tell you today
p17
aVis a different story about a claim, an aim and a task
p18
aVwhich I think give one quite a lot better purchase on the matter.
p19
aa(lp20
VFirst the claim: Why do people think trust has declined?
p21
aVAnd if I really think about it on the basis of my own evidence,
p22
aVI don't know the answer.
p23
aVI'm inclined to think it may have declined
p24
aVin some activities or some institutions
p25
aVand it might have grown in others.
p26
aVI don't have an overview.
p27
aVBut, of course, I can look at the opinion polls,
p28
aVand the opinion polls are supposedly
p29
aVthe source of a belief that trust has declined.
p30
aVWhen you actually look at opinion polls across time,
p31
aVthere's not much evidence for that.
p32
aVThat's to say, the people who were mistrusted
p33
aV20 years ago,
p34
aVprincipally journalists and politicians, are still mistrusted.
p35
aVAnd the people who were highly trusted 20 years ago
p36
aVare still rather highly trusted: judges, nurses.
p37
aVThe rest of us are in between,
p38
aVand by the way, the average person in the street
p39
aVis almost exactly midway.
p40
aVBut is that good evidence?
p41
aVWhat opinion polls record is, of course, opinions.
p42
aVWhat else can they record?
p43
aVSo they're looking at the generic attitudes
p44
aVthat people report when you ask them certain questions.
p45
aVDo you trust politicians? Do you trust teachers?
p46
aa(lp47
VNow if somebody said to you, "Do you trust greengrocers?
p48
aVDo you trust fishmongers?
p49
aVDo you trust elementary school teachers?"
p50
aVyou would probably begin by saying, "To do what?"
p51
aVAnd that would be a perfectly sensible response.
p52
aVAnd you might say, when you understood the answer to that,
p53
aV"Well, I trust some of them, but not others."
p54
aVThat's a perfectly rational thing.
p55
aVIn short, in our real lives,
p56
aVwe seek to place trust in a differentiated way.
p57
aVWe don't make an assumption that the level of trust
p58
aVthat we will have in every instance of a certain type
p59
aVof official or office-holder or type of person
p60
aVis going to be uniform.
p61
aVI might, for example, say that I certainly trust
p62
aVa certain elementary school teacher I know
p63
aVto teach the reception class to read,
p64
aVbut in no way to drive the school minibus.
p65
aVI might, after all, know that she wasn't a good driver.
p66
aVI might trust my most loquacious friend
p67
aVto keep a conversation going
p68
aVbut not \u2014 but perhaps not to keep a secret.
p69
aVSimple.
p70
aa(lp71
VSo if we've got those evidence in our ordinary lives
p72
aVof the way that trust is differentiated,
p73
aVwhy do we sort of drop all that intelligence
p74
aVwhen we think about trust more abstractly?
p75
aVI think the polls are very bad guides
p76
aVto the level of trust that actually exists,
p77
aVbecause they try to obliterate the good judgment
p78
aVthat goes into placing trust.
p79
aa(lp80
VSecondly, what about the aim?
p81
aVThe aim is to have more trust.
p82
aVWell frankly, I think that's a stupid aim.
p83
aVIt's not what I would aim at.
p84
aVI would aim to have more trust in the trustworthy
p85
aVbut not in the untrustworthy.
p86
aVIn fact, I aim positively to try not to trust the untrustworthy.
p87
aVAnd I think, of those people who, for example,
p88
aVplaced their savings with the very aptly named Mr. Madoff,
p89
aVwho then made off with them,
p90
aVand I think of them, and I think, well, yes,
p91
aVtoo much trust.
p92
aVMore trust is not an intelligent aim in this life.
p93
aVIntelligently placed and intelligently refused trust
p94
aVis the proper aim.
p95
aVWell once one says that, one says, yeah, okay,
p96
aVthat means that what matters in the first place
p97
aVis not trust but trustworthiness.
p98
aVIt's judging how trustworthy people are
p99
aVin particular respects.
p100
aa(lp101
VAnd I think that judgment requires us to look at three things.
p102
aVAre they competent? Are they honest? Are they reliable?
p103
aVAnd if we find that a person is competent
p104
aVin the relevant matters,
p105
aVand reliable and honest,
p106
aVwe'll have a pretty good reason to trust them,
p107
aVbecause they'll be trustworthy.
p108
aVBut if, on the other hand, they're unreliable, we might not.
p109
aVI have friends who are competent and honest,
p110
aVbut I would not trust them to post a letter,
p111
aVbecause they're forgetful.
p112
aVI have friends who are very confident
p113
aVthey can do certain things,
p114
aVbut I realize that they overestimate their own competence.
p115
aVAnd I'm very glad to say, I don't think I have many friends
p116
aVwho are competent and reliable but extremely dishonest.
p117
aV(Laughter)
p118
aVIf so, I haven't yet spotted it.
p119
aa(lp120
VBut that's what we're looking for:
p121
aVtrustworthiness before trust.
p122
aVTrust is the response.
p123
aVTrustworthiness is what we have to judge.
p124
aVAnd, of course, it's difficult.
p125
aVAcross the last few decades, we've tried to construct
p126
aVsystems of accountability for all sorts of institutions
p127
aVand professionals and officials and so on
p128
aVthat will make it easier for us to judge their trustworthiness.
p129
aVA lot of these systems have the converse effect.
p130
aVThey don't work as they're supposed to.
p131
aVI remember I was talking with a midwife who said,
p132
aV"Well, you see, the problem is it takes longer
p133
aVto do the paperwork than to deliver the baby."
p134
aVAnd all over our public life, our institutional life,
p135
aVwe find that problem,
p136
aVthat the system of accountability
p137
aVthat is meant to secure trustworthiness
p138
aVand evidence of trustworthiness
p139
aVis actually doing the opposite.
p140
aVIt is distracting people who have to do difficult tasks,
p141
aVlike midwives, from doing them
p142
aVby requiring them to tick the boxes, as we say.
p143
aVYou can all give your own examples there.
p144
aa(lp145
VSo so much for the aim.
p146
aVThe aim, I think, is more trustworthiness,
p147
aVand that is going to be different
p148
aVif we are trying to be trustworthy
p149
aVand communicate our trustworthiness to other people,
p150
aVand if we are trying to judge whether other people
p151
aVor office-holders or politicians are trustworthy.
p152
aVIt's not easy. It is judgment, and simple reaction,
p153
aVattitudes, don't do adequately here.
p154
aa(lp155
VNow thirdly, the task.
p156
aVCalling the task rebuilding trust, I think,
p157
aValso gets things backwards.
p158
aVIt suggests that you and I should rebuild trust.
p159
aVWell, we can do that for ourselves.
p160
aVWe can rebuild a bit of trustworthiness.
p161
aVWe can do it two people together trying to improve trust.
p162
aVBut trust, in the end, is distinctive
p163
aVbecause it's given by other people.
p164
aVYou can't rebuild what other people give you.
p165
aVYou have to give them the basis
p166
aVfor giving you their trust.
p167
aVSo you have to, I think, be trustworthy.
p168
aVAnd that, of course, is because you can't fool
p169
aVall of the people all of the time, usually.
p170
aVBut you also have to provide usable evidence
p171
aVthat you are trustworthy.
p172
aVHow to do it?
p173
aVWell every day, all over the place, it's being done
p174
aVby ordinary people, by officials, by institutions,
p175
aVquite effectively.
p176
aVLet me give you a simple commercial example.
p177
aVThe shop where I buy my socks says I may take them back,
p178
aVand they don't ask any questions.
p179
aVThey take them back and give me the money
p180
aVor give me the pair of socks of the color I wanted.
p181
aVThat's super. I trust them
p182
aVbecause they have made themselves vulnerable to me.
p183
aVI think there's a big lesson in that.
p184
aVIf you make yourself vulnerable to the other party,
p185
aVthen that is very good evidence that you are trustworthy
p186
aVand you have confidence in what you are saying.
p187
aVSo in the end, I think what we are aiming for
p188
aVis not very difficult to discern.
p189
aVIt is relationships in which people are trustworthy
p190
aVand can judge when and how the other person
p191
aVis trustworthy.
p192
aa(lp193
VSo the moral of all this is,
p194
aVwe need to think much less about trust,
p195
aVlet alone about attitudes of trust
p196
aVdetected or mis-detected by opinion polls,
p197
aVmuch more about being trustworthy,
p198
aVand how you give people adequate, useful
p199
aVand simple evidence that you're trustworthy.
