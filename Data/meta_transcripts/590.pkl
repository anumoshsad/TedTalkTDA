VCharles and Ray were a team. They were husband and wife.
p4
aVDespite the New York Times' and Vanity Fair's best efforts recently,
p5
aVthey're not brothers. (Laughter)
p6
aVAnd they were a lot of fun.
p7
aVYou know, Ray was the one who wore the ampersands in the family.
p8
aV(Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
VWe are going to focus on Charles today, because it is Charles' 100th birthday.
p11
aVBut when I speak of him, I'm really speaking of both of them as a team.
p12
aVHere's Charles when he was three. So he would be 100 this June.
p13
aVWe have a lot of cool celebrations that we're going to do.
p14
aVThe thing about their work
p15
aVis that most people come to the door of furniture \u2014
p16
aVI suspect you probably recognize this chair
p17
aVand some of the others I'm going to show you.
p18
aVBut we're going to first enter through the door of the Big Top.
p19
aVThe whole thing about this, though, is that, you know, why am I showing it?
p20
aVIs it because Charles and Ray made this film?
p21
aVThis is actually a training film for a clown college that they had.
p22
aVThey also practiced a clown act when the future of furniture
p23
aVwas not nearly as auspicious as it turned out to be.
p24
aVThere is a picture of Charles. So let's watch the next clip.
p25
aa(lp26
VThe film that we're about to see is a film they made for the Moscow World's Fair.
p27
aa(lp28
VVideo: This is the land.
p29
aVIt has many contrasts.
p30
aVIt is rough and it is flat.
p31
aVIn places it is cold.
p32
aVIn some it is hot.
p33
aVToo much rain falls on some areas,
p34
aVand not enough on others.
p35
aVBut people live on this land.
p36
aVAnd, as in Russia,
p37
aVthey are drawn together into towns and cities.
p38
aVHere is something of the way they live.
p39
aa(lp40
VEames Demetrios: Now, this is a film that was hardly ever seen in the United States.
p41
aVIt was on seven screens and it was 200 feet across.
p42
aVAnd it was at the height of the Cold War.
p43
aVThe Nixon-Khrushchev Kitchen Debate
p44
aVhappened about 50 feet from where this was shown.
p45
aVAnd yet, how did it start?
p46
aVYou know, commonality, the first line
p47
aVin Charles' narration was,
p48
aV"The same stars that shine down on Russia
p49
aVshine down on the United States. From the sky,
p50
aVour cities look much the same."
p51
aVIt was that human connection that Charles and Ray always found in everything.
p52
aVAnd you can imagine, and the thing about it is,
p53
aVthat they believed that the human mind could handle this number of images
p54
aVbecause the important thing was to get the gestalt
p55
aVof what the images were about.
p56
aa(lp57
VSo that was just a little snip.
p58
aVBut the thing about Charles and Ray
p59
aVis that they were always modeling stuff.
p60
aVThey were always trying things out.
p61
aVI think one of the things I am passionate about, my grandparents work,
p62
aVI'm passionate about my work,
p63
aVbut on top of all that I'm passionate
p64
aVabout a holistic vision of design,
p65
aVwhere design is a life skill, not a professional skill.
p66
aVAnd you know, those of us with kids often want our kids to take music.
p67
aVI'm no exception.
p68
aVBut it's not about them becoming Bono or Tracy Chapman.
p69
aVIt's about getting that music thing going through their heads and their thinking.
p70
aa(lp71
VDesign is the same way. Design has to become that same way.
p72
aVAnd this is a model that they did of that seven-screen presentation.
p73
aVAnd Charles just checking it out there.
p74
aVSo now we're going to go through that door of furniture.
p75
aVThis is an unusual installation of airport seating.
p76
aVSo what we're going to see is some of the icons of Eames furniture.
p77
aa(lp78
VAnd the thing about their furniture is that they said the role of the designer
p79
aVwas essentially that of a good host,
p80
aVanticipating the needs of the guest.
p81
aVSo those are cool images. But these are ones I think are really cool.
p82
aVThese are all the prototypes. These are the mistakes,
p83
aValthough I don't think mistakes is the right word in design.
p84
aVIt's just the things you try out
p85
aVto kind of make it work better.
p86
aVAnd you know some of them would probably be terrible chairs.
p87
aVSome of them are kind of cool looking. It's like "Hey, why didn't they try that?"
p88
aVIt was that hands-on iterative process
p89
aVwhich is so much like vernacular design
p90
aVand folk design in traditional cultures.
p91
aa(lp92
VAnd I think that's one of the commonalities between modernism
p93
aVand traditional design. I think it may be a real common ground
p94
aVas we kind of figure out what on earth to do in the next 20 or 30 years.
p95
aVThe other thing that's kind of cool is that
p96
aVyou look at this and in the media when people say design,
p97
aVthey actually mean style.
p98
aVAnd I'm really here to talk about design.
p99
aVBut you know the object is just a pivot.
p100
aVIt's a pivot between a process and a system.
p101
aa(lp102
VAnd this is a little film I made
p103
aVabout the making of the Eames lounge chair.
p104
aVThe design process for Charles and Ray
p105
aVnever ended in manufacturing.
p106
aVIt continued. They were always trying to make thing better and better.
p107
aVBecause it's like as Bill Clinton was saying about Rwandan health clinics.
p108
aVIt's not enough to create one.
p109
aVYou've got to create a system that will work better and better.
p110
aVSo I've always liked this prototype picture.
p111
aVBecause it just kind of, you know, doesn't get any more basic than that.
p112
aVYou try things out.
p113
aa(lp114
VThis is a relatively famous chair.
p115
aVIts early version had an "X" base. That's what the collectors like.
p116
aVCharles and Ray liked this one because it was better.
p117
aVIt worked better: "H" base, much more practical.
p118
aVThis is something called a splint.
p119
aVAnd I was very touched by Dean Kamen's
p120
aVwork for the military, or for the soldiers,
p121
aVbecause Charles and Ray designed a molded plywood splint. This is it.
p122
aVAnd they'd been working on furniture before.
p123
aVBut doing these splints they learned a lot about the manufacturing process,
p124
aVwhich was incredibly important to them.
p125
aa(lp126
VI'm trying to show you too much,
p127
aVbecause I want you to really get a broth of ideas and images.
p128
aVThis is a house that Charles and Ray designed.
p129
aVMy sister is chasing someone else. It's not me.
p130
aVAlthough I endorse heartily the fact that he stole her diary, it's not me.
p131
aVAnd then this is a film, on the lower left, that Charles and Ray made.
p132
aVNow look at that plastic chair.
p133
aVThe house is 1949.
p134
aVThe chair is done in 1949.
p135
aa(lp136
VCharles and Ray,
p137
aVthey didn't obsess about style for it's own sake.
p138
aVThey didn't say, "Our style is curves. Let's make the house curvy."
p139
aVThey didn't say, "Our style is grids. Let's make the chair griddy."
p140
aVThey focused on the need.
p141
aVThey tried to solve the design problem.
p142
aVCharles used to say, "The extent to which you have a design style
p143
aVis the extent to which you have not solved the design problem."
p144
aVIt's kind of a brutal quote.
p145
aVThis is the earlier design of that house.
p146
aVAnd again, they managed to figure out a way to make a prototype
p147
aVof a house \u2014 architecture, very expensive medium.
p148
aa(lp149
VHere's a film we've been hearing things about.
p150
aVThe "Powers of Ten" is a film they made.
p151
aVIf we watch the next clip,
p152
aVyou're going to see the first version of "Powers of Ten," upper left.
p153
aVThe familiar one on the lower right.
p154
aVThe Eames' film Tops, lower left.
p155
aVAnd a lamp that Charles designed for a church.
p156
aa(lp157
VVideo: Which in turn belongs to a local group of galaxies.
p158
aVThese form part of a grouping system
p159
aVmuch as the stars do.
p160
aVThey are so many and so varied that from this distance
p161
aVthey appear like the stars from Earth.
p162
aa(lp163
VED: You've seen that film, and what's so great about this
p164
aVwhole conference is that everybody has been talking about scale.
p165
aVEverybody here is coming at it from a different way.
p166
aVI want to give you one example.
p167
aVE.O. Wilson once told me that when he looked at ants \u2014
p168
aVhe loved them, of course, and he wanted to learn more about them \u2014
p169
aVhe consciously looked at them from the standpoint of scale.
p170
aVSo here is the tiny creature.
p171
aVAnd yet simply by changing the frame of reference
p172
aVit reveals so much, including what ended up being the TED Prize.
p173
aa(lp174
VModeling, they tried modeling all the time. They were always modeling things.
p175
aVAnd I think part of that is that they never delegated understanding.
p176
aVAnd I think in our family we were very lucky,
p177
aVbecause we learned about design backwards.
p178
aVDesign was not something other.
p179
aVIt was part of the business of life in general.
p180
aVIt was part of the quality of life.
p181
aVAnd here is some family pictures.
p182
aVAnd you can see why I'm down on style, with a haircut like that.
p183
aVBut anyway, (Laughter)
p184
aVI remember the cut grapefruit that we would have at the Eames house when I was a kid.
p185
aVSo we're going to watch another film.
p186
aa(lp187
VThis is a film, the one called Toys.
p188
aVYou can see me, I have the same haircut, in the upper right corner.
p189
aVUpper left is a film they did on toy trains.
p190
aVLower right is a solar do-nothing toy.
p191
aVLower left is Day-of-the-Dead toys.
p192
aVCharles used to say that toys are not as innocent as they appear.
p193
aVThey are often the precursor to bigger things.
p194
aVAnd these ideas \u2014 that train up there, being about the honest use of materials,
p195
aVis totally the same
p196
aVas the honest use of materials in the plywood.
p197
aa(lp198
VAnd now I'm going to test you.
p199
aVThis is a letter that my grandfather sent to my mom when she was five years old.
p200
aVSo can you read it?
p201
aVLucia angel,
p202
aVokay, eye.
p203
aa(lp204
VAudience: Saw many trains.
p205
aa(lp206
VED: Awl, also, good that the leather crafter's guild is here.
p207
aVAlso, what is he doing? Row, rowed.
p208
aVSun? No. Well is there another name for a sunrise?
p209
aVDawn, very good.
p210
aVAlso rode on one. I ...
p211
aa(lp212
VAudience: You had, I hope you had \u2014
p213
aa(lp214
VED: Now you've been to the website Dogs of Saint Louis
p215
aVin the late, in the mid-1930's,
p216
aVthen you'd know that was a Great Dane.
p217
aVSo, I hope you had a
p218
aa(lp219
VAudience: Nice time, time \u2014
p220
aa(lp221
VED: Time at.
p222
aVCitizen Kane, rose \u2014
p223
aa(lp224
VAudience: Rosebud.
p225
aa(lp226
VED: No, bud. "D"'s right. At Buddy's \u2014
p227
aa(lp228
VAudience: Party. Love.
p229
aa(lp230
VED: Okay, good.
p231
aVSo, "I saw many trains and also rode on one.
p232
aVI hope you had a nice time at Buddy's party."
p233
aVSo you guys did pretty good, cool.
p234
aVSo my mom and Charles had this great relationship
p235
aVwhere they'd send those sorts of things back and forth to one another.
p236
aVAnd it's all part of the, you know,
p237
aVthey used to say, "Take your pleasure seriously."
p238
aa(lp239
VThese are some images from a project of mine
p240
aVthat's called Kymaerica.
p241
aVIt's sort of an alternative universe.
p242
aVIt's kind of a reinterpretation of the landscape.
p243
aVThose plaques are plaques we've been installing around North America.
p244
aVWe're about to do six in the U.K. next week.
p245
aVAnd they honor events in the linear world from the fictional world.
p246
aVSo, of course, since it's bronze it has to be true.
p247
aa(lp248
VVideo: Kymaerica with waterfalls,
p249
aVtumbling through our \u2014
p250
aa(lp251
VED: This is one of the traditional Kymaerican songs.
p252
aVAnd so we had spelling bees in Paris, Illinois.
p253
aa(lp254
VVideo: Your word is N. Carolina.
p255
aa(lp256
VGirl: Y-I-N-D-I-A-N-A.
p257
aa(lp258
VED: And then Embassy Row is actually a historical site,
p259
aVbecause in the Kymaerican story
p260
aVthis is where the Parisian Diaspora started, where there embassy was.
p261
aVSo you can actually visit and have this three-dimensional
p262
aVfictional experience there.
p263
aVAnd the town has really embraced it.
p264
aVWe had the spelling bee in conjunction with the Gwomeus Club.
p265
aa(lp266
VBut what is really cool is that we take our visual environment
p267
aVas inevitable. And it's not.
p268
aVOther things could have happened. The Japanese could have discovered Monterey.
p269
aVAnd we could have been born 100,000 years ago.
p270
aVAnd there are a lot of fun things. This is the Museum of the Bench.
p271
aVThey have trading cards
p272
aVand all sorts of cool things.
p273
aVAnd you're kind of trapped in the texture of Kymaerica.
p274
aVThe Tahatchabe, the great road building culture.
p275
aVA guy named Nobu Naga,
p276
aVthe so-called Japanese Columbus.
p277
aVBut now I'm going to return you to the real world.
p278
aa(lp279
VAnd this is Cranbrook. I've got a real treat for you,
p280
aVwhich is the first film that Charles ever made.
p281
aVSo let's watch that. Nobody's ever seen it.
p282
aVCranbrook is very generous to let us show it for the first time here.
p283
aVIt's a film about Maya Gretel, a famous ceramicist, and a teacher at Cranbrook.
p284
aVAnd he made it for the 1939 faculty exhibition.
p285
aVSilent. We don't have a track for it yet.
p286
aVVery simple. It's just a start. But it's that learn-by-doing thing.
p287
aVYou want to learn how to make films? Go make a movie.
p288
aVAnd you try something out.
p289
aa(lp290
VBut here is what's really great.
p291
aVSee that chair there? The orange one? That's the organic chair. 1940.
p292
aVAt the same time that Charles was doing that chair,
p293
aVhe was doing this film.
p294
aVSo my point is that this scope of vision, this holistic vision
p295
aVof design, was with them from the beginning.
p296
aVIt wasn't like "Oh, we made some chairs and got successful.
p297
aVNow we're going to do some movies."
p298
aVIt was always part of how they looked at the world. And that's what's really powerful.
p299
aVAnd I think that all of us in this room, as you move design forward,
p300
aVit's not about just doing one thing.
p301
aVIt's about how you approach problems. And there is this huge, beautiful commonality
p302
aVbetween design, business and the world.
p303
aVSo we're going to do the last clip.
p304
aVAnd I've shown you some of the images. I just want to focus on sound now.
p305
aVSo this is Charles' voice.
p306
aa(lp307
VCharles Eames: In India, those without, and the lowest in caste,
p308
aVeat very often, particularly in southern India,
p309
aVthey eat off of a banana leaf.
p310
aVAnd those a little bit up the scale
p311
aVeat off of a sort of a low-fired ceramic dish.
p312
aVAnd a little bit higher, why they have a glaze
p313
aVon a thing they call a thali.
p314
aVIf you're up the scale a little bit more,
p315
aVwhy, a brass thali.
p316
aVAnd then things get to be a little questionable.
p317
aVThere are things like silver-plated thalis.
p318
aVAnd there is solid silver thalis.
p319
aVAnd I suppose some nut has had a
p320
aVgold thali that he's eaten off of.
p321
aa(lp322
VBut you can go beyond that.
p323
aVAnd the guys that have not only means,
p324
aVbut a certain amount of knowledge and understanding,
p325
aVgo to the next step, and they eat off a banana leaf.
p326
aVAnd I think that in these times
p327
aVwhen we fall back and regroup,
p328
aVthat somehow or other,
p329
aVthe banana leaf parable
p330
aVsort of got to get working there,
p331
aVbecause I'm not prepared to say
p332
aVthat the banana leaf that one eats off of
p333
aVis the same as the other eats off of.
p334
aVBut it is that process that has happened within the man
p335
aVthat changes the banana leaf.
p336
aa(lp337
VED: I've been looking forward to sharing that quote with you.
p338
aVBecause that's part of where we've got to get to.
p339
aVAnd I also want to share this one.
p340
aV"Beyond the age of information is the age of choices."
p341
aVAnd I really think that's where we are.
p342
aVAnd it's kind of cool for me to be part of a family
p343
aVand a tradition where he was talking about that in 1978.
p344
aVAnd part of why this stuff is important
p345
aVand all the things that we do are important,
p346
aVis that these are the ideas we need.
p347
aVAnd I think that this is all part of surrendering to the design journey.
p348
aVThat's what we all need to do.
p349
aVDesign is not just for designers anymore. It's a process. It's not style.
p350
aVAll that great thinking needs to really get about solving
p351
aVpretty key problems.
p352
aVI really thank you for your time.
