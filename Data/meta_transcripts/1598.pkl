VI was one of those kids that, every time I got in the car,
p4
aVI basically had to roll down the window.
p5
aVIt was usually too hot, too stuffy or just too smelly,
p6
aVand my father would not let us use the air conditioner.
p7
aVHe said that it would overheat the engine.
p8
aVAnd you might remember, some of you,
p9
aVhow the cars were back then, and it was
p10
aVa common problem of overheating.
p11
aVBut it was also the signal that capped the use,
p12
aVor overuse, of energy-consuming devices.
p13
aa(lp14
VThings have changed now. We have cars that we take across country.
p15
aVWe blast the air conditioning the entire way,
p16
aVand we never experience overheating.
p17
aVSo there's no more signal for us to tell us to stop.
p18
aa(lp19
VGreat, right? Well, we have similar problems in buildings.
p20
aVIn the past, before air conditioning, we had thick walls.
p21
aVThe thick walls are great for insulation. It keeps the interior
p22
aVvery cool during the summertime, and warm during the wintertime,
p23
aVand the small windows were also very good because
p24
aVit limited the amount of temperature transfer
p25
aVbetween the interior and exterior.
p26
aVThen in about the 1930s, with the advent of plate glass,
p27
aVrolled steel and mass production, we were able
p28
aVto make floor-to-ceiling windows and unobstructed views,
p29
aVand with that came the irreversible reliance on
p30
aVmechanical air conditioning to cool our solar-heated spaces.
p31
aVOver time, the buildings got taller and bigger,
p32
aVour engineering even better, so that the mechanical systems
p33
aVwere massive. They require a huge amount of energy.
p34
aVThey give off a lot of heat into the atmosphere,
p35
aVand for some of you may understand the heat island effect
p36
aVin cities, where the urban areas are much more warm
p37
aVthan the adjacent rural areas,
p38
aVbut we also have problems that, when we lose power,
p39
aVwe can't open a window here, and so
p40
aVthe buildings are uninhabitable and have to be made vacant
p41
aVuntil that air conditioning system can start up again.
p42
aVEven worse, with our intention of trying to make buildings
p43
aVmove towards a net-zero energy state, we can't do it
p44
aVjust by making mechanical systems more and more efficient.
p45
aVWe need to look for something else, and we've gotten ourselves a little bit into a rut.
p46
aa(lp47
VSo what do we do here? How do we pull ourselves and dig us
p48
aVout of this hole that we've dug?
p49
aVIf we look at biology, and many of you probably don't know,
p50
aVI was a biology major before I went into architecture,
p51
aVthe human skin is the organ that naturally regulates
p52
aVthe temperature in the body, and it's a fantastic thing.
p53
aVThat's the first line of defense for the body.
p54
aVIt has pores, it has sweat glands, it has all these things
p55
aVthat work together very dynamically and very efficiently,
p56
aVand so what I propose is that our building skins
p57
aVshould be more similar to human skin,
p58
aVand by doing so can be much more dynamic, responsive
p59
aVand differentiated, depending on where it is.
p60
aa(lp61
VAnd this gets me back to my research.
p62
aVWhat I proposed first doing is looking at a different material palette to do that.
p63
aVI presently, or currently, work with smart materials,
p64
aVand a smart thermo-bimetal.
p65
aVFirst of all, I guess we call it smart because it requires
p66
aVno controls and it requires no energy,
p67
aVand that's a very big deal for architecture.
p68
aVWhat it is, it's a lamination of two different metals together.
p69
aVYou can see that here by the different reflection on this side.
p70
aVAnd because it has two different coefficients of expansion,
p71
aVwhen heated, one side will expand faster than the other
p72
aVand result in a curling action.
p73
aVSo in early prototypes I built these surfaces to try to see
p74
aVhow the curl would react to temperature and possibly allow
p75
aVair to ventilate through the system,
p76
aVand in other prototypes did surfaces where the multiplicity
p77
aVof having these strips together can try to make
p78
aVbigger movement happen when also heated,
p79
aVand currently have this installation at the Materials & Applications gallery
p80
aVin Silver Lake, close by, and it's there until August, if you want to see it.
p81
aVIt's called "Bloom," and the surface is made completely
p82
aVout of thermo-bimetal, and its intention is to make this canopy
p83
aVthat does two things. One, it's a sun-shading device, so that
p84
aVwhen the sun hits the surface, it constricts the amount of sun passing through,
p85
aVand in other areas, it's a ventilating system,
p86
aVso that hot, trapped air underneath can actually
p87
aVmove through and out when necessary.
p88
aa(lp89
VYou can see here in this time-lapse video that the sun,
p90
aVas it moves across the surface, as well as the shade,
p91
aVeach of the tiles moves individually.
p92
aVKeep in mind, with the digital technology that we have today,
p93
aVthis thing was made out of about 14,000 pieces
p94
aVand there's no two pieces alike at all. Every single one is different.
p95
aVAnd the great thing with that is the fact that we can calibrate
p96
aVeach one to be very, very specific to its location,
p97
aVto the angle of the sun, and also how the thing actually curls.
p98
aa(lp99
VSo this kind of proof of concept project
p100
aVhas a lot of implications
p101
aVto actual future application in architecture,
p102
aVand in this case, here you see a house,
p103
aVthat's for a developer in China,
p104
aVand it's actually a four-story glass box.
p105
aVIt's still with that glass box because we still want that visual access,
p106
aVbut now it's sheathed with this thermo-bimetal layer,
p107
aVit's a screen that goes around it, and that layer can actually
p108
aVopen and close as that sun moves around on that surface.
p109
aVIn addition to that, it can also screen areas for privacy,
p110
aVso that it can differentiate from some of the public areas
p111
aVin the space during different times of day.
p112
aVAnd what it basically implies is that, in houses now,
p113
aVwe don't need drapes or shutters or blinds anymore
p114
aVbecause we can sheath the building with these things,
p115
aVas well as control the amount of air conditioning you need inside that building.
p116
aa(lp117
VI'm also looking at trying to develop some building components for the market,
p118
aVand so here you see a pretty typical
p119
aVdouble-glazed window panel, and in that panel,
p120
aVbetween those two pieces of glass, that double-glazing,
p121
aVI'm trying to work on making
p122
aVa thermo-bimetal pattern system
p123
aVso that when the sun hits that outside layer
p124
aVand heats that interior cavity, that thermo-bimetal
p125
aVwill begin to curl, and what actually will happen then
p126
aVis it'll start to block out the sun
p127
aVin certain areas of the building,
p128
aVand totally, if necessary.
p129
aVAnd so you can imagine, even in this application, that
p130
aVin a high-rise building where the panel systems go
p131
aVfrom floor to floor up to 30, 40 floors, the entire surface
p132
aVcould be differentiated at different times of day
p133
aVdepending on how that sun moves across and hits that surface.
p134
aa(lp135
VAnd these are some later studies that I'm working on
p136
aVright now that are on the boards, where you can see,
p137
aVin the bottom right-hand corner, with the red, it's actually
p138
aVsmaller pieces of thermometal, and it's actually going to,
p139
aVwe're trying to make it move like cilia or eyelashes.
p140
aa(lp141
VThis last project is also of components.
p142
aVThe influence \u2014 and if you have noticed, one of my
p143
aVspheres of influence is biology \u2014 is from a grasshopper.
p144
aVAnd grasshoppers have a different kind of breathing system.
p145
aVThey breathe through holes in their sides called spiracles,
p146
aVand they bring the air through and it moves through their system to cool them down,
p147
aVand so in this project, I'm trying to look at how we can
p148
aVconsider that in architecture too, how we can bring
p149
aVair through holes in the sides of a building.
p150
aVAnd so you see here some early studies of blocks,
p151
aVwhere those holes are actually coming through,
p152
aVand this is before the thermo-bimetal is applied,
p153
aVand this is after the bimetal is applied. Sorry, it's a little
p154
aVhard to see, but on the surfaces, you can see these red arrows.
p155
aVOn the left, it's when it's cold and the thermo-bimetal
p156
aVis flat so it will constrict air from passing through the blocks,
p157
aVand on the right, the thermo-bimetal curls
p158
aVand allows that air to pass through, so those are two different
p159
aVcomponents that I'm working on, and again,
p160
aVit's a completely different thing, because you can imagine
p161
aVthat air could potentially be coming through the walls
p162
aVinstead of opening windows.
p163
aa(lp164
VSo I want to leave you with one last impression about
p165
aVthe project, or this kind of work and using smart materials.
p166
aVWhen you're tired of opening and closing those blinds
p167
aVday after day, when you're on vacation
p168
aVand there's no one there on the weekends to be turning off and on the controls,
p169
aVor when there's a power outage, and you have
p170
aVno electricity to rely on, these thermo-bimetals
p171
aVwill still be working tirelessly, efficiently
p172
aVand endlessly. Thank you. (Applause)
