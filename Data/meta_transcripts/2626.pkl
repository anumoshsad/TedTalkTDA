VEconomists have been exploring people's behavior for hundreds of years:
p4
aVhow we make decisions,
p5
aVhow we act individually and in groups,
p6
aVhow we exchange value.
p7
aVThey've studied the institutions that facilitate our trade,
p8
aVlike legal systems,
p9
aVcorporations,
p10
aVmarketplaces.
p11
aVBut there is a new, technological institution
p12
aVthat will fundamentally change how we exchange value,
p13
aVand it's called the blockchain.
p14
aa(lp15
VNow, that's a pretty bold statement,
p16
aVbut if you take nothing else away from this talk,
p17
aVI actually want you to remember
p18
aVthat while blockchain technology is relatively new,
p19
aVit's also a continuation of a very human story,
p20
aVand the story is this.
p21
aVAs humans, we find ways
p22
aVto lower uncertainty about one another
p23
aVso that we can exchange value.
p24
aa(lp25
VNow, one of the first people to really explore the idea
p26
aVof institutions as a tool in economics
p27
aVto lower our uncertainties about one another
p28
aVand be able to do trade
p29
aVwas the Nobel economist Douglass North.
p30
aVHe passed away at the end of 2015,
p31
aVbut North pioneered what's called "new institutional economics."
p32
aVAnd what he meant by institutions were really just formal rules
p33
aVlike a constitution,
p34
aVand informal constraints, like bribery.
p35
aVThese institutions are really the grease
p36
aVthat allow our economic wheels to function,
p37
aVand we can see this play out over the course of human history.
p38
aa(lp39
VIf we think back to when we were hunter-gatherer economies,
p40
aVwe really just traded within our village structure.
p41
aVWe had some informal constraints in place,
p42
aVbut we enforced all of our trade with violence
p43
aVor social repercussions.
p44
aVAs our societies grew more complex
p45
aVand our trade routes grew more distant,
p46
aVwe built up more formal institutions,
p47
aVinstitutions like banks for currency,
p48
aVgovernments, corporations.
p49
aVThese institutions helped us manage our trade
p50
aVas the uncertainty and the complexity grew,
p51
aVand our personal control was much lower.
p52
aVEventually with the internet, we put these same institutions online.
p53
aVWe built platform marketplaces like Amazon, eBay, Alibaba,
p54
aVjust faster institutions that act as middlemen
p55
aVto facilitate human economic activity.
p56
aa(lp57
VAs Douglass North saw it,
p58
aVinstitutions are a tool to lower uncertainty
p59
aVso that we can connect and exchange all kinds of value in society.
p60
aVAnd I believe we are now entering
p61
aVa further and radical evolution
p62
aVof how we interact and trade,
p63
aVbecause for the first time, we can lower uncertainty
p64
aVnot just with political and economic institutions,
p65
aVlike our banks, our corporations, our governments,
p66
aVbut we can do it with technology alone.
p67
aa(lp68
VSo what is the blockchain?
p69
aVBlockchain technology is a decentralized database
p70
aVthat stores a registry of assets and transactions
p71
aVacross a peer-to-peer network.
p72
aVIt's basically a public registry
p73
aVof who owns what and who transacts what.
p74
aVThe transactions are secured through cryptography,
p75
aVand over time, that transaction history gets locked in blocks of data
p76
aVthat are then cryptographically linked together and secured.
p77
aVThis creates an immutable, unforgeable record
p78
aVof all of the transactions across this network.
p79
aVThis record is replicated on every computer that uses the network.
p80
aa(lp81
VIt's not an app.
p82
aVIt's not a company.
p83
aVI think it's closest in description to something like Wikipedia.
p84
aVWe can see everything on Wikipedia.
p85
aVIt's a composite view that's constantly changing and being updated.
p86
aVWe can also track those changes over time on Wikipedia,
p87
aVand we can create our own wikis,
p88
aVbecause at their core, they're just a data infrastructure.
p89
aVOn Wikipedia, it's an open platform that stores words and images
p90
aVand the changes to that data over time.
p91
aVOn the blockchain,
p92
aVyou can think of it as an open infrastructure
p93
aVthat stores many kinds of assets.
p94
aVIt stores the history of custodianship,
p95
aVownership and location
p96
aVfor assets like the digital currency Bitcoin,
p97
aVother digital assets
p98
aVlike a title of ownership of IP.
p99
aVIt could be a certificate, a contract,
p100
aVreal world objects,
p101
aVeven personal identifiable information.
p102
aVThere are of course other technical details to the blockchain,
p103
aVbut at its core, that's how it works.
p104
aVIt's this public registry that stores transactions in a network
p105
aVand is replicated so that it's very secure and hard to tamper with.
p106
aa(lp107
VWhich brings me to my point
p108
aVof how blockchains lower uncertainty
p109
aVand how they therefore promise to transform our economic systems
p110
aVin radical ways.
p111
aVSo uncertainty is kind of a big term
p112
aVin economics,
p113
aVbut I want to go through three forms of it
p114
aVthat we face in almost all of our everyday transactions,
p115
aVwhere blockchains can play a role.
p116
aVWe face uncertainties like not knowing who we're dealing with,
p117
aVnot having visibility into a transaction
p118
aVand not having recourse if things go wrong.
p119
aa(lp120
VSo let's take the first example, not knowing who we're dealing with.
p121
aVSay I want to buy a used smartphone on eBay.
p122
aVThe first thing I'm going to do is look up who I'm buying from.
p123
aVAre they a power user?
p124
aVDo they have great reviews and ratings, or do they have no profile at all?
p125
aVReviews, ratings, checkmarks:
p126
aVthese are the attestations about our identities
p127
aVthat we cobble together today
p128
aVand use to lower uncertainty about who we're dealing with.
p129
aVBut the problem is they're very fragmented.
p130
aVThink about how many profiles you have.
p131
aVBlockchains allow for us to create an open, global platform
p132
aVon which to store any attestation about any individual
p133
aVfrom any source.
p134
aVThis allows us to create a user-controlled
p135
aVportable identity.
p136
aVMore than a profile,
p137
aVit means you can selectively reveal
p138
aVthe different attributes about you
p139
aVthat help facilitate trade or interaction,
p140
aVfor instance that a government issued you an ID,
p141
aVor that you're over 21,
p142
aVby revealing the cryptographic proof
p143
aVthat these details exist and are signed off on.
p144
aVHaving this kind of portable identity
p145
aVaround the physical world and the digital world
p146
aVmeans we can do all kinds of human trade
p147
aVin a totally new way.
p148
aa(lp149
VSo I've talked about how blockchains could lower uncertainty
p150
aVin who we're dealing with.
p151
aVThe second uncertainty that we often face
p152
aVis just not having transparency into our interactions.
p153
aVSay you're going to send me that smartphone by mail.
p154
aVI want some degree of transparency.
p155
aVI want to know that the product I bought is the same one that arrives in the mail
p156
aVand that there's some record for how it got to me.
p157
aVThis is true not just for electronics like smartphones,
p158
aVbut for many kinds of goods and data,
p159
aVthings like medicine, luxury goods,
p160
aVany kind of data or product that we don't want tampered with.
p161
aa(lp162
VThe problem in many companies,
p163
aVespecially those that produce something complicated like a smartphone,
p164
aVis they're managing all of these different vendors
p165
aVacross a horizontal supply chain.
p166
aVAll of these people that go into making a product,
p167
aVthey don't have the same database.
p168
aVThey don't use the same infrastructure,
p169
aVand so it becomes really hard to see transparently a product evolve over time.
p170
aa(lp171
VUsing the blockchain, we can create
p172
aVa shared reality across nontrusting entities.
p173
aVBy this I mean
p174
aVall of these nodes in the network do not need to know each other
p175
aVor trust each other,
p176
aVbecause they each have the ability
p177
aVto monitor and validate the chain for themselves.
p178
aVThink back to Wikipedia.
p179
aVIt's a shared database,
p180
aVand even though it has multiple readers
p181
aVand multiple writers at the same time,
p182
aVit has one single truth.
p183
aVSo we can create that using blockchains.
p184
aVWe can create a decentralized database that has the same efficiency of a monopoly
p185
aVwithout actually creating that central authority.
p186
aVSo all of these vendors, all sorts of companies,
p187
aVcan interact using the same database without trusting one another.
p188
aVIt means for consumers, we can have a lot more transparency.
p189
aVAs a real-world object travels along,
p190
aVwe can see its digital certificate or token move on the blockchain,
p191
aVadding value as it goes.
p192
aVThis is a whole new world in terms of our visibility.
p193
aa(lp194
VSo I've talked about how blockchains can lower our uncertainties about identity
p195
aVand how they change what we mean about transparency
p196
aVin long distances and complex trades, like in a supply chain.
p197
aVThe last uncertainty that we often face
p198
aVis one of the most open-ended, and it's reneging.
p199
aVWhat if you don't send me the smartphone?
p200
aVCan I get my money back?
p201
aVBlockchains allow us to write code,
p202
aVbinding contracts,
p203
aVbetween individuals
p204
aVand then guarantee that those contracts will bear out
p205
aVwithout a third party enforcer.
p206
aVSo if we look at the smartphone example, you could think about escrow.
p207
aVYou are financing that phone,
p208
aVbut you don't need to release the funds
p209
aVuntil you can verify that all the conditions have been met.
p210
aVYou got the phone.
p211
aa(lp212
VI think this is one of the most exciting ways
p213
aVthat blockchains lower our uncertainties,
p214
aVbecause it means to some degree
p215
aVwe can collapse institutions and their enforcement.
p216
aVIt means a lot of human economic activity
p217
aVcan get collateralized and automated,
p218
aVand push a lot of human intervention to the edges,
p219
aVthe places where information moves from the real world to the blockchain.
p220
aa(lp221
VI think what would probably floor Douglass North
p222
aVabout this use of technology
p223
aVis the fact that the very thing that makes it work,
p224
aVthe very thing that keeps the blockchain secure and verified,
p225
aVis our mutual distrust.
p226
aVSo rather than all of our uncertainties
p227
aVslowing us down
p228
aVand requiring institutions
p229
aVlike banks, our governments, our corporations,
p230
aVwe can actually harness all of that collective uncertainty
p231
aVand use it to collaborate and exchange more and faster and more open.
p232
aa(lp233
VNow, I don't want you to get the impression
p234
aVthat the blockchain is the solution to everything,
p235
aVeven though the media has said that it's going to end world poverty,
p236
aVit's also going to solve the counterfeit drug problem
p237
aVand potentially save the rainforest.
p238
aVThe truth is, this technology is in its infancy,
p239
aVand we're going to need to see a lot of experiments take place
p240
aVand probably fail
p241
aVbefore we truly understand all of the use cases
p242
aVfor our economy.
p243
aVBut there are tons of people working on this,
p244
aVfrom financial institutions
p245
aVto technology companies, start-ups and universities.
p246
aVAnd one of the reasons is that it's not just an economic evolution.
p247
aVIt's also an innovation in computer science.
p248
aa(lp249
VBlockchains give us the technological capability
p250
aVof creating a record of human exchange,
p251
aVof exchange of currency,
p252
aVof all kinds of digital and physical assets,
p253
aVeven of our own personal attributes,
p254
aVin a totally new way.
p255
aVSo in some ways,
p256
aVthey become a technological institution
p257
aVthat has a lot of the benefits
p258
aVof the traditional institutions we're used to using in society,
p259
aVbut it does this in a decentralized way.
p260
aVIt does this by converting a lot of our uncertainties
p261
aVinto certainties.
p262
aa(lp263
VSo I think we need to start preparing ourselves,
p264
aVbecause we are about to face a world
p265
aVwhere distributed, autonomous institutions
p266
aVhave quite a significant role.
p267
aa(lp268
VThank you.
p269
aa(lp270
V(Applause)
p271
aa(lp272
VBruno Giussani: Thank you, Bettina.
p273
aVI think I understood that it's coming,
p274
aVit offers a lot of potential,
p275
aVand it's complex.
p276
aVWhat is your estimate for the rate of adoption?
p277
aa(lp278
VBettina Warburg: I think that's a really good question.
p279
aVMy lab is pretty much focused
p280
aVon going the enterprise and government route first,
p281
aVbecause in reality, blockchain is a complex technology.
p282
aVHow many of you actually understand how the internet works?
p283
aVBut you use it every day,
p284
aVso I think we're sort of facing the same John Sculley idea
p285
aVof technology should either be invisible or beautiful,
p286
aVand blockchain is kind of neither of those things right now,
p287
aVso it's better suited for either really early adopters
p288
aVwho kind of get it and can tinker around
p289
aVor for finding those best use cases
p290
aVlike identity or asset tracking or smart contracts
p291
aVthat can be used at that level of an enterprise or government.
p292
