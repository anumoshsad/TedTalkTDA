VThere's a lot of exciting things happening in the design world
p4
aVand at IDEO this past year,
p5
aVand I'm pleased to get a chance to share some of those with you.
p6
aa(lp7
VI didn't attend the first TED back in 1984
p8
aVbut I've been to a lot of them since that time.
p9
aVI thought it [would] kind of be interesting to think back to that time
p10
aVwhen Richard got the whole thing started. Thank you very much, Richard;
p11
aVit's been a big, enjoyable part of my life, coming here.
p12
aa(lp13
VAnd so thinking back, I was thinking
p14
aVthose of us in Silicon Valley were really focused on products or objects \u2014
p15
aVcertainly technological objects.
p16
aVAnd so it was great fun in those days, and some of those of you
p17
aVwho are in the audience were my clients.
p18
aVWe'd come in with some prototype underneath a black cloth
p19
aVand we'd put it on the conference table,
p20
aVand we'd pull off the black cloth and everybody would "ooh" and "ah."
p21
aVThat was a really good time.
p22
aa(lp23
VAnd so we'll continue to focus on products, as we always have.
p24
aVAnd if you were here last year,
p25
aVI probably wrestled you to the floor and tried to show you my new EyeModule 2,
p26
aVwhich was a camera that plugged into the Handspring.
p27
aVAnd I took a lot of pictures last year;
p28
aVvery few people knew what I was up to, but I took a lot of pictures.
p29
aVThis year \u2014 maybe you could show the slides \u2014
p30
aVthis year we're carrying this Treo, which we had a lot to do with
p31
aVand helped Handspring design it.
p32
aVAlso, though we designed it a few years ago \u2014
p33
aVit's just become ubiquitous in the last year or so \u2014
p34
aVthis Heartstream defibrillator which is saving lives.
p35
aVMaybe you've seen them in the airports? They seem to be everywhere now.
p36
aVLots of lives are being saved by those.
p37
aVAnd, we're just about to announce the Zinio Reader product
p38
aVthat I believe will make magazines even more enjoyable to read.
p39
aVSo, we really will continue to focus on products.
p40
aa(lp41
VBut something's happened in the last 18 years since Richard started TED,
p42
aVand that's that people like us \u2014
p43
aVI know people in other places have caught onto this for a long time,
p44
aVbut for us, we've really just started ... we've kind of
p45
aVclimbed Maslow's hierarchy a little bit \u2014
p46
aVand so we're now focused more and more on human-centered design,
p47
aVhuman-centeredness in an approach to design.
p48
aVThat really involves designing behaviors and personality into products.
p49
aVAnd I think you're starting to see that,
p50
aVand it's making our job even more enjoyable.
p51
aa(lp52
VInterestingly enough, we used to primarily build 3-D models \u2014
p53
aVyou know, you've seen some today \u2014 and 3-D renderings.
p54
aVThen we'd go and we'd show those as communicating our ideas.
p55
aVBut firms like ours are having to move to a point where
p56
aVwe get those objects that we're designing and get them in motion,
p57
aVshowing how they'll be used.
p58
aVAnd so in order to do that we've been forming
p59
aVinternal video-production groups
p60
aVin order to make these kind of experience prototypes
p61
aVthat show just what we mean about the man-machine relationship.
p62
aVAnd it's a much better way to see.
p63
aVIt's kind of like architects who show people in their houses,
p64
aVas opposed to them being empty.
p65
aa(lp66
VSo I thought that I would show you a few videos
p67
aVto show off this new, broader definition
p68
aVof design in products and services and environments.
p69
aVI have a few of them \u2014 they're no more than a minute
p70
aVor a minute-and-a-half apiece \u2014
p71
aVbut I thought you might be interested in seeing some of our
p72
aVwork over the last year, and how it responds in video.
p73
aa(lp74
VSo, Prada New York: we were asked by Rem Koolhaas
p75
aVand OMA to help us conceive the technology
p76
aVthat's in their retail store in New York.
p77
aVHe wanted a new kind of store \u2014 a new one \u2014
p78
aVa store that had a cultural role as well as a retail one.
p79
aVAnd that meant actually designing custom technology
p80
aVas opposed to just buying things off the shelf and putting them to use.
p81
aa(lp82
VSo, there're lots of things. Everything has RF tags:
p83
aVthere's RF tags on the user, on the cards,
p84
aVthere's the staff devices that are all around the store.
p85
aVYou pick them up, and once you see something that you're interested in,
p86
aVthe staff person can scan them in
p87
aVand then they can be shown on any screen throughout the store.
p88
aVYou can look at color, and sizes, and how it appeared on the runway, or whatever.
p89
aVAnd so then the object \u2014 the merchandise that you're interested in \u2014
p90
aVcan be scanned. It's taken into the dressing room,
p91
aVand in the dressing room there are scanners
p92
aVso that we know exactly what clothing you have in the dressing room.
p93
aVWe can put that up on a touch screen
p94
aVand you can play with that, and get more information
p95
aVabout the clothing that you're interested in as you're trying it on.
p96
aVIt's been used a lot of places, but I particularly like the use here
p97
aVof liquid crystal displays in the changing room.
p98
aa(lp99
VThe last time I went to see this store,
p100
aVthere was a huge buzz about people standing outside and wondering,
p101
aV"Am I going to actually get to see the people changing clothes here?"
p102
aVBut if you push the button, of course, the whole wall goes dark.
p103
aVSo you can try to get approval, or not, for whatever you're wearing.
p104
aVAnd then one of my favorite features of the technology
p105
aVis the magic mirror, where you put on the clothes.
p106
aVThere's a big display in the mirror, and you can turn around \u2014
p107
aVbut there's a three second delay.
p108
aVSo you can see what you look like from the back or all the way around, as you look.
p109
aV(Applause)
p110
aa(lp111
VAbout a year and a half ago we were asked to design
p112
aVan installation in the museum \u2014
p113
aVthis is a new wing of the Science Museum in London,
p114
aVand it's primarily about digital and biomedical issues.
p115
aVAnd a group at Itch, which is now part of IDEO,
p116
aVdesigned this interactive wall that's about four stories tall.
p117
aVI don't know if anybody's seen this \u2014
p118
aVit's pretty spectacular in the room.
p119
aa(lp120
VAnyway, it's based on the London subway system.
p121
aVAnd so you can see that
p122
aVthe goal is to bring some of the feedback
p123
aVthat the people who had gone to the museum were giving,
p124
aVand get it up on the wall so everybody could see. Just for everybody to see.
p125
aVSo you enter your information. Then, like the London tube system,
p126
aVthe little trains go around with what you're thinking about.
p127
aVAnd then when you get to a station, it's expanded so that you can actually read it.
p128
aa(lp129
VThen when you exit the IMAX theatre on the fourth floor \u2014
p130
aVmostly teenagers coming out of there \u2014
p131
aVthere's this big open space that has these tables in it
p132
aVthat have interactive games which are quite fun,
p133
aValso designed by Durrell [Bishop] and Andrew [Hirniak] of Itch.
p134
aVAnd the topics include things that the museum is about:
p135
aVmale fertility, choosing the sex of your baby
p136
aVor what a driverless car might be like.
p137
aVThere's lots of room, so people can come up
p138
aVand understand what it is before they get involved.
p139
aa(lp140
VAnd also, it's not shown in the video, but these are very beautiful.
p141
aVThey go to the top of the wall and when they reach all the way to the top,
p142
aVafter they've bounced around, they disperse into bits
p143
aVand go off into the atmosphere.
p144
aa(lp145
VThe next video is not done by us.
p146
aVThis is CBS Sunday Morning that aired about two weeks ago.
p147
aVScott Adams ran into us
p148
aVand asked us if we wouldn't help to design
p149
aVthe ultimate cubicle for Dilbert,
p150
aVwhich sounded like a fun thing and so we couldn't pass it up.
p151
aVHe's always been interested in technology in the future.
p152
aa(lp153
V(Video: Scott Adams: I realized that at some point I might be
p154
aVthe world's expert on what's wrong with cubicles.
p155
aVSo we thought, well, wouldn't it be fun to get together
p156
aVwith some of the smartest design guys in the world
p157
aVand try to figure out if we could make the cubicle better?
p158
aa(lp159
VNarrator: Though they work in a wide-open office space
p160
aVspectacularly set under San Francisco's Oakland Bay Bridge,
p161
aVthe team built their own little cubicles
p162
aVto fully experience the problems.
p163
aa(lp164
VWoman: A one-way mirror. I can look out; you can look at yourself.
p165
aa(lp166
VNarrator: They took pictures.
p167
aa(lp168
VWoman: You feel so trapped, when someone kind of leans over
p169
aVand you're sort of held captive there for a minute.
p170
aa(lp171
VSA: So far it's chaos, but a lot of people are doing stuff, so that's good.
p172
aVWe'll see what happens.
p173
aa(lp174
VNarrator: The first group builds a cubicle in which the walls are screens
p175
aVfor the computer and for family photos.
p176
aVIn the second group's scenario, the walls are alive
p177
aVand actually give Dilbert a group hug.
p178
aV(Laughter)
p179
aVBehind the humor is the idea of making the cubicle more human.)
p180
aa(lp181
VDavid Kelley: So here's the final thing, complete with orange lighting
p182
aVthat follows the sun across \u2014 that follows the tracks of the sun \u2014 across the sky.
p183
aVSo you feel that in your cubicle.
p184
aVAnd my favorite feature, which is a flower in a vase
p185
aVthat wilts when you leave in disappointment,
p186
aVand then when you come back, it comes up to greet you, happy to see you.
p187
aa(lp188
V(SA: The storage is built right into the wall.)
p189
aa(lp190
VDK: You know, it has homey touches like a built-in fish tank in the walls,
p191
aVor something to be aggressive with to release tension.
p192
aa(lp193
V(SA: Customizable for the boss of your choice.)
p194
aa(lp195
VDK: And of course: a hammock for your afternoon nap
p196
aVthat stretches across your cubicle.
p197
aa(lp198
V(SA: Life would be sweet in a cubicle like this.)
p199
aa(lp200
VDK: This next project, we were asked to design a pavilion to celebrate
p201
aVthe recycling of the water on the Millennium Dome in London.
p202
aVThe dome has an incredible amount of water that washes off of it,
p203
aVas well as wastewater.
p204
aVSo this building actually celebrates the water
p205
aVas it comes out of the recycling plant and goes into the reed bed
p206
aVso that it can be filtered for the final time.
p207
aa(lp208
VThe pavilion's design goal was to be kind of quiet and peaceful.
p209
aVIn contrast to if you went inside the dome, where it's
p210
aVkind of wild and crazy and everybody's
p211
aVlearning all kinds of things, or fooling around, or whatever they're doing.
p212
aVBut it was intended to be quite quiet.
p213
aVAnd then you would wander around and gather information,
p214
aVin a straightforward fashion, about the recycling process
p215
aVand what's being done, and how they're going to reuse the water
p216
aVonce it comes through the plant.
p217
aVAnd then, if you saw,
p218
aVthe panels actually rotate. So you can get the information
p219
aVon the front side, but as they rotate, you can see the actual
p220
aVrecycling plant behind, with all the machines as they actually process the water.
p221
aVYou can see: there's the plant.
p222
aVThese are all very low-budget videos, like quick prototypes.
p223
aa(lp224
VAnd we're announcing a new product here tonight,
p225
aVwhich is the first time this has ever been shown in public.
p226
aVIt's called Spyfish, and it's a company called H2Eye,
p227
aVstarted by Nigel Jagger in London.
p228
aVAnd it's a company that's trying to bring the experience \u2014 many people have boats,
p229
aVor enjoy being on boats, but a very small percentage of people
p230
aVactually have the capability or the interest in going under the water
p231
aVand actually seeing what's there,
p232
aVand enjoying what scuba divers do.
p233
aVThis product, it has two cameras.
p234
aVYou throw it over the side of your boat
p235
aVand you basically scuba dive without getting wet.
p236
aa(lp237
VFor us \u2014 there's the object \u2014 for us, it was two projects. One, to design the interface
p238
aVso that the interface doesn't get in your way.
p239
aVYou could have that kind of immersive experience of being underwater \u2014
p240
aVof feeling like you're underwater \u2014 seeing what's going on.
p241
aVAnd the other one was to design the object
p242
aVand make sure that it was a consumer product and not a research tool.
p243
aVAnd so we spent a lot of time \u2014 this has been going on for about
p244
aVseven or eight years, this project \u2014
p245
aVand [we're] just ready to start building them.
p246
aa(lp247
V(Narrator: The Spyfish is a revolutionary subaquatic video camera.
p248
aVIt can dive to 500 feet, to where sunlight does not penetrate,
p249
aVand is equipped with powerful lights.
p250
aVIt becomes your eyes and ears as you venture into the deep.
p251
aVThe battery-powered Spyfish sends the live video-feed through a slender cable.)
p252
aa(lp253
VDK: This slender cable was a huge technological advancement
p254
aVand it allowed the whole thing to be the size that it is.
p255
aa(lp256
V(Narrator: And this central box connects the whole system together.
p257
aVManeuvering the Spyfish is simple with the wireless remote control.
p258
aVYou watch the video with superimposed graphics
p259
aVthat indicate your depth and compass heading.
p260
aVThe fluid graphics and ambient sounds combine
p261
aVto help you completely lose yourself underwater.)
p262
aV(Applause)
p263
aa(lp264
VDK: And the last thing I'll talk about is ApproTEC,
p265
aVwhich is a project that I'm very excited about.
p266
aVApproTEC is a company started by Dr. Martin Fisher,
p267
aVwho's a good friend of mine. He's a Ph.D. from Stanford.
p268
aVHe found himself in Kenya on a Fulbright
p269
aVand he had a very interesting insight, which is that
p270
aVhe said, "There must be entrepreneurs in Kenya;
p271
aVthere must be entrepreneurs everywhere."
p272
aVAnd he noticed that for weddings and funerals there
p273
aVthey could find enough money to put something together.
p274
aVSo he decided to start manufacturing products in Kenya
p275
aVwith Kenyan manufacturers \u2014 designed by people like us, but taken there.
p276
aVAnd to this date \u2014 he's been gone for only a few years \u2014
p277
aVhe's started 19,000 companies.
p278
aVHe's made 30,000 new jobs.
p279
aVAnd just the sales of the products \u2014 this is a non-profit \u2014
p280
aVthe sales of these products is now .6% of the GDP of Kenya.
p281
aVThis is one guy doing this. This is a pretty spectacular thing.
p282
aa(lp283
VSo we're in the process of helping them design
p284
aVdeep-well, low-cost manual pumps
p285
aVin order for these people who have a quarter acre of land
p286
aVto be able to grow crops in the off-season.
p287
aVWhat they do now is: they can grow crops in the rainy season
p288
aVbut they can't grow them in the off-season.
p289
aVAnd so by doing that, the woman that you saw in the first thing \u2014
p290
aVshe's a school teacher \u2014 always wanted to send her kids to college
p291
aVand she's going to be able to do it because of these things.
p292
aVSo with seed-squeezers, and pumps, and hay-balers and
p293
aVvery straightforward things that we're designing \u2014
p294
aVmy students are doing this as class projects
p295
aVand IDEO has donated their time to do this kind of work \u2014
p296
aVit's really amazing to see his success, Martin's.
p297
aa(lp298
VWe also were thinking about the experience of Richard,
p299
aVand so \u2014
p300
aV(Laughter)
p301
aV\u2014 we designed this hat, because I knew I'd be the last one in the day
p302
aVand I needed to deal with him. So I just have one more thing to say.
p303
aV(Laughter)
p304
aVCan you read it?
p305
aV(Laughter)
p306
aVWell, it's always kind of funny when he comes up and hovers.
p307
aVYou know, you don't want to be rude to him and you don't want to feel guilty,
p308
aVand so I thought this would do it, where I just sit here.
p309
aV(Laughter)
p310
aV(Applause)
p311
aa(lp312
VSo we saw a lot of interesting things being designed today in this session,
p313
aVand from all the different presenters.
p314
aVAnd in my own practice, from product to ApproTEC,
p315
aVit's really exciting that we're taking a more human-centered approach to design,
p316
aVthat we're including behaviors and personalities in the things we do,
p317
aVand I think this is great.
p318
aVDesigners are more trusted and more integrated
p319
aVinto the business strategy of companies,
p320
aVand I have to say, for one, I feel very lucky at the progress that design
p321
aVhas made since the first TED. Thanks a lot.
