VOpenness. It's a word that
p4
aVdenotes opportunity and possibilities.
p5
aVOpen-ended, open hearth,
p6
aVopen source, open door policy,
p7
aVopen bar. (Laughter)
p8
aa(lp9
VAnd everywhere the world is opening up,
p10
aVand it's a good thing.
p11
aa(lp12
VWhy is this happening?
p13
aVThe technology revolution is opening the world.
p14
aa(lp15
VYesterday's Internet was a platform
p16
aVfor the presentation of content.
p17
aVThe Internet of today is a platform for computation.
p18
aVThe Internet is becoming a giant
p19
aVglobal computer, and every time you go on it,
p20
aVyou upload a video, you do a Google search,
p21
aVyou remix something,
p22
aVyou're programming this big global computer
p23
aVthat we all share.
p24
aVHumanity is building a machine,
p25
aVand this enables us to collaborate in new ways.
p26
aVCollaboration can occur on
p27
aVan astronomical basis.
p28
aa(lp29
VNow a new generation is opening up the world as well.
p30
aVI started studying kids about 15 years ago,
p31
aV\u2014 so actually 20 years ago now \u2014
p32
aVand I noticed how my own children were
p33
aVeffortlessly able to use all this sophisticated technology,
p34
aVand at first I thought,
p35
aV"My children are prodigies!" (Laughter)
p36
aVBut then I noticed all their friends were like them,
p37
aVso that was a bad theory.
p38
aVSo I've started working with a few hundred kids,
p39
aVand I came to the conclusion
p40
aVthat this is the first generation to come of age
p41
aVin the digital age,
p42
aVto be bathed in bits.
p43
aVI call them the Net Generation.
p44
aVI said, these kids are different.
p45
aVThey have no fear of technology, because it's not there.
p46
aVIt's like the air.
p47
aVIt's sort of like, I have no fear of a refrigerator.
p48
aVAnd \u2014 (Laughter)
p49
aa(lp50
VAnd there's no more powerful force to change
p51
aVevery institution than the first generation of digital natives.
p52
aVI'm a digital immigrant.
p53
aVI had to learn the language.
p54
aa(lp55
VThe global economic crisis is opening up the world as well.
p56
aVOur opaque institutions from the Industrial Age,
p57
aVeverything from old models of the corporation,
p58
aVgovernment, media, Wall Street,
p59
aVare in various stages of being stalled or frozen
p60
aVor in atrophy or even failing,
p61
aVand this is now creating a burning platform in the world.
p62
aVI mean, think about Wall Street.
p63
aVThe core modus operandi of Wall Street almost brought down
p64
aVglobal capitalism.
p65
aa(lp66
VNow, you know the idea of a burning platform,
p67
aVthat you're somewhere where the costs of staying where you are
p68
aVbecome greater than the costs of moving to something different,
p69
aVperhaps something radically different.
p70
aVAnd we need to change
p71
aVand open up all of our institutions.
p72
aa(lp73
VSo this technology push,
p74
aVa demographic kick from a new generation
p75
aVand a demand pull from a new
p76
aVeconomic global environment
p77
aVis causing the world to open up.
p78
aa(lp79
VNow, I think, in fact,
p80
aVwe're at a turning point in human history,
p81
aVwhere we can finally now rebuild
p82
aVmany of the institutions of the Industrial Age
p83
aVaround a new set of principles.
p84
aa(lp85
VNow, what is openness?
p86
aVWell, as it turns out, openness
p87
aVhas a number of different meanings,
p88
aVand for each there's a corresponding principle
p89
aVfor the transformation of
p90
aVcivilization.
p91
aVThe first is collaboration.
p92
aVNow, this is openness in the sense of the boundaries
p93
aVof organizations becoming more porous and fluid
p94
aVand open.
p95
aa(lp96
VThe guy in the picture here,
p97
aVI'll tell you his story.
p98
aVHis name is Rob McEwen.
p99
aVI'd like to say, "I have this think tank, we scour the world
p100
aVfor amazing case studies."
p101
aVThe reason I know this story
p102
aVis because he's my neighbor. (Laughter)
p103
aVHe actually moved across the street from us,
p104
aVand he held a cocktail party
p105
aVto meet the neighbors, and he says, "You're Don Tapscott.
p106
aVI've read some of your books."
p107
aVI said, "Great. What do you do?"
p108
aVAnd he says, "Well I used to be a banker
p109
aVand now I'm a gold miner."
p110
aVAnd he tells me this amazing story.
p111
aVHe takes over this gold mine, and his geologists
p112
aVcan't tell him where the gold is.
p113
aVHe gives them more money for geological data,
p114
aVthey come back, they can't tell
p115
aVhim where to go into production.
p116
aVAfter a few years, he's so frustrated he's ready
p117
aVto give up, but he has an epiphany one day.
p118
aVHe wonders, "If my geologists don't know where the gold is,
p119
aVmaybe somebody else does."
p120
aVSo he does a "radical" thing.
p121
aVHe takes his geological data,
p122
aVhe publishes it and he holds a contest on the Internet
p123
aVcalled the Goldcorp Challenge.
p124
aVIt's basically half a million dollars in prize money
p125
aVfor anybody who can tell me, do I have any gold,
p126
aVand if so, where is it? (Laughter)
p127
aa(lp128
VHe gets submissions from all around the world.
p129
aVThey use techniques that he's never heard of,
p130
aVand for his half a million dollars in prize money,
p131
aVRob McEwen finds 3.4 billion dollars worth of gold.
p132
aVThe market value of his company
p133
aVgoes from 90 million to 10 billion dollars,
p134
aVand I can tell you, because he's my neighbor,
p135
aVhe's a happy camper. (Laughter)
p136
aa(lp137
VYou know, conventional wisdom says talent is inside, right?
p138
aVYour most precious asset goes out the elevator every night.
p139
aVHe viewed talent differently.
p140
aVHe wondered, who are their peers?
p141
aVHe should have fired his geology department, but he didn't.
p142
aVYou know, some of the best submissions
p143
aVdidn't come from geologists.
p144
aVThey came from computer scientists, engineers.
p145
aVThe winner was a computer graphics company
p146
aVthat built a three dimensional model of the mine
p147
aVwhere you can helicopter underground
p148
aVand see where the gold is.
p149
aa(lp150
VHe helped us understand that social media's becoming
p151
aVsocial production.
p152
aVIt's not about hooking up online.
p153
aVThis is a new means of production in the making.
p154
aVAnd this Ideagora that he created, an open market, agora,
p155
aVfor uniquely qualified minds,
p156
aVwas part of a change, a profound change in the deep structure
p157
aVand architecture of our organizations,
p158
aVand how we sort of orchestrate capability to innovate,
p159
aVto create goods and services,
p160
aVto engage with the rest of the world,
p161
aVin terms of government, how we create public value.
p162
aVOpenness is about collaboration.
p163
aa(lp164
VNow secondly, openness is about transparency.
p165
aVThis is different. Here, we're talking about the communication
p166
aVof pertinent information to stakeholders of organizations:
p167
aVemployees, customers, business partners, shareholders,
p168
aVand so on.
p169
aa(lp170
VAnd everywhere, our institutions are becoming naked.
p171
aVPeople are all bent out of shape about WikiLeaks,
p172
aVbut that's just the tip of the iceberg.
p173
aVYou see, people at their fingertips now, everybody,
p174
aVnot just Julian Assange,
p175
aVhave these powerful tools for finding out what's going on,
p176
aVscrutinizing, informing others,
p177
aVand even organizing collective responses.
p178
aVInstitutions are becoming naked,
p179
aa(lp180
Vand if you're going to be naked,
p181
aVwell, there's some corollaries that flow from that.
p182
aVI mean, one is,
p183
aVfitness is no longer optional. (Laughter)
p184
aVYou know? Or if you're going to be naked, you'd better get buff.
p185
aa(lp186
VNow, by buff I mean, you need to have good value,
p187
aVbecause value is evidenced like never before.
p188
aVYou say you have good products.
p189
aVThey'd better be good.
p190
aVBut you also need to have values.
p191
aVYou need to have integrity as part of your bones
p192
aVand your DNA as an organization,
p193
aVbecause if you don't, you'll be unable to build trust,
p194
aVand trust is a sine qua non of this new network world.
p195
aa(lp196
VSo this is good. It's not bad.
p197
aVSunlight is the best disinfectant.
p198
aVAnd we need a lot of sunlight in this troubled world.
p199
aa(lp200
VNow, the third meaning and corresponding principle
p201
aVof openness is about sharing.
p202
aVNow this is different than transparency.
p203
aVTransparency is about the communication of information.
p204
aVSharing is about giving up assets, intellectual property.
p205
aa(lp206
VAnd there are all kinds of famous stories about this.
p207
aVIBM gave away 400 million dollars of software
p208
aVto the Linux movement, and that gave them
p209
aVa multi-billion dollar payoff.
p210
aa(lp211
VNow, conventional wisdom says,
p212
aV"Well, hey, our intellectual property belongs to us,
p213
aVand if someone tries to infringe it, we're going to get out
p214
aVour lawyers and we're going to sue them."
p215
aVWell, it didn't work so well for the record labels, did it?
p216
aVI mean, they took \u2014 They had a technology disruption,
p217
aVand rather than taking a business model innovation
p218
aVto correspond to that, they took and sought a legal solution
p219
aVand the industry that brought you Elvis and the Beatles
p220
aVis now suing children
p221
aVand is in danger of collapse.
p222
aa(lp223
VSo we need to think differently about intellectual property.
p224
aa(lp225
VI'll give you an example.
p226
aVThe pharmaceutical industry is in deep trouble.
p227
aVFirst of all, there aren't a lot of big inventions
p228
aVin the pipeline, and this is a big problem for human health,
p229
aVand the pharmaceutical industry has got a bigger problem,
p230
aVthat they're about to fall off something
p231
aVcalled the patent cliff.
p232
aVDo you know about this?
p233
aVThey're going to lose 20 to 35 percent of their revenue
p234
aVin the next 12 months.
p235
aVAnd what are you going to do,
p236
aVlike, cut back on paper clips or something? No.
p237
aa(lp238
VWe need to reinvent the whole model of scientific research.
p239
aVThe pharmaceutical industry needs to place assets
p240
aVin a commons. They need to start sharing precompetitive research.
p241
aVThey need to start sharing
p242
aVclinical trial data,
p243
aVand in doing so, create a rising tide that could lift all boats,
p244
aVnot just for the industry but
p245
aVfor humanity.
p246
aa(lp247
VNow, the fourth meaning
p248
aVof openness,
p249
aVand corresponding principle, is about empowerment.
p250
aVAnd I'm not talking about the motherhood sense here.
p251
aVKnowledge and intelligence is power,
p252
aVand as it becomes more distributed, there's a
p253
aVconcomitant distribution
p254
aVand decentralization and disaggregation of power
p255
aVthat's underway in the world today.
p256
aVThe open world is bringing freedom.
p257
aa(lp258
VNow, take the Arab Spring.
p259
aVThe debate about the role of social media
p260
aVand social change has been settled.
p261
aVYou know, one word: Tunisia.
p262
aVAnd then it ended up having a whole bunch of other words too.
p263
aVBut in the Tunisian revolution,
p264
aVthe new media didn't cause the revolution;
p265
aVit was caused by injustice.
p266
aVSocial media didn't create the revolution;
p267
aVit was created by a new generation of young people
p268
aVwho wanted jobs and hope and
p269
aVwho didn't want to be treated as subjects anymore.
p270
aa(lp271
VBut just as the Internet drops transaction and collaboration
p272
aVcosts in business and government,
p273
aVit also drops the cost of dissent, of rebellion,
p274
aVand even insurrection
p275
aVin ways that people didn't understand.
p276
aa(lp277
VYou know, during the Tunisian revolution,
p278
aVsnipers associated with the regime were killing
p279
aVunarmed students in the street.
p280
aVSo the students would take their mobile devices,
p281
aVtake a picture, triangulate the location,
p282
aVsend that picture to friendly military units,
p283
aVwho'd come in and take out the snipers.
p284
aVYou think that social media is about hooking up online?
p285
aVFor these kids, it was a military tool
p286
aVto defend unarmed people from murderers.
p287
aVIt was a tool of self-defense.
p288
aa(lp289
VYou know, as we speak today, young people
p290
aVare being killed in Syria,
p291
aVand up until three months ago,
p292
aVif you were injured on the street,
p293
aVan ambulance would pick you up,
p294
aVtake you to the hospital, you'd go in, say, with a broken leg,
p295
aVand you'd come out with a bullet in your head.
p296
aa(lp297
VSo these 20-somethings created
p298
aVan alternative health care system,
p299
aVwhere what they did is they used Twitter and basic
p300
aVpublicly available tools that when someone's injured,
p301
aVa car would show up, it would pick them up,
p302
aVtake them to a makeshift medical clinic, where you'd get
p303
aVmedical treatment, as opposed to being executed.
p304
aVSo this is a time of great change.
p305
aa(lp306
VNow, it's not without its problems.
p307
aVUp until two years ago,
p308
aVall revolutions in human history had a leadership,
p309
aVand when the old regime fell, the leadership
p310
aVand the organization would take power.
p311
aVWell, these wiki revolutions happen so fast
p312
aVthey create a vacuum, and
p313
aVpolitics abhors a vacuum,
p314
aVand unsavory forces can fill that,
p315
aVtypically the old regime,
p316
aVor extremists, or fundamentalist forces.
p317
aVYou can see this playing out today in Egypt.
p318
aa(lp319
VBut that doesn't matter,
p320
aVbecause this is moving forward.
p321
aVThe train has left the station. The cat is out of the bag.
p322
aVThe horse is out of the barn. Help me out here, okay?
p323
aV(Laughter) The toothpaste is out of the tube.
p324
aVI mean, we're not putting this one back.
p325
aVThe open world is bringing empowerment and freedom.
p326
aa(lp327
VI think, at the end of these four days,
p328
aVthat you'll come to conclude that the arc of history
p329
aVis a positive one, and it's towards openness.
p330
aa(lp331
VIf you go back a few hundred years,
p332
aVall around the world it was a very closed society.
p333
aVIt was agrarian, and the means of production
p334
aVand political system was called feudalism, and knowledge
p335
aVwas concentrated in the church and the nobility.
p336
aVPeople didn't know about things.
p337
aVThere was no concept of progress.
p338
aVYou were born, you lived your life and you died.
p339
aa(lp340
VBut then Johannes Gutenberg came along with his great invention,
p341
aVand, over time, the society opened up.
p342
aVPeople started to learn about things, and when they did,
p343
aVthe institutions of feudal society appeared
p344
aVto be stalled, or frozen, or failing.
p345
aVIt didn't make sense for the church to be responsible
p346
aVfor medicine when people had knowledge.
p347
aa(lp348
VSo we saw the Protestant Reformation.
p349
aVMartin Luther called the printing press
p350
aV"God's highest act of grace."
p351
aVThe creation of a corporation, science, the university,
p352
aVeventually the Industrial Revolution,
p353
aVand it was all good.
p354
aa(lp355
VBut it came with a cost.
p356
aa(lp357
VAnd now, once again, the technology genie
p358
aVis out of the bottle, but this time it's different.
p359
aVThe printing press gave us access to the written word.
p360
aVThe Internet enables each of us to be a producer.
p361
aVThe printing press gave us access to recorded knowledge.
p362
aVThe Internet gives us access,
p363
aVnot just to information and knowledge, but
p364
aVto the intelligence contained in the crania of other people
p365
aVon a global basis.
p366
aa(lp367
VTo me, this is not an information age,
p368
aVit's an age of networked intelligence.
p369
aVIt's an age of vast promise,
p370
aVan age of collaboration,
p371
aVwhere the boundaries of our organizations are changing,
p372
aVof transparency, where sunlight
p373
aVis disinfecting civilization,
p374
aVan age of sharing and understanding
p375
aVthe new power of the commons,
p376
aVand it's an age of empowerment
p377
aVand of freedom.
p378
aa(lp379
VNow, what I'd like to do is,
p380
aVto close, to share with you
p381
aVsome research that I've been doing.
p382
aVI've tried to study all kinds of organizations
p383
aVto understand what the future might look like,
p384
aVbut I've been studying nature recently.
p385
aa(lp386
VYou know, bees come in swarms
p387
aVand fish come in schools.
p388
aVStarlings, in the area around Edinburgh,
p389
aVin the moors of England,
p390
aVcome in something called a murmuration,
p391
aVand the murmuration refers to the murmuring of the wings
p392
aVof the birds, and throughout the day the starlings
p393
aVare out over a 20-mile radius
p394
aVsort of doing their starling thing.
p395
aVAnd at night they come together
p396
aVand they create one of the most spectacular things
p397
aVin all of nature,
p398
aVand it's called a murmuration.
p399
aVAnd scientists that have studied this have said
p400
aVthey've never seen an accident.
p401
aVNow, this thing has a function.
p402
aVIt protects the birds.
p403
aVYou can see on the right here,
p404
aVthere's a predator being chased away by the collective power
p405
aVof the birds, and apparently this is a frightening thing
p406
aVif you're a predator of starlings.
p407
aVAnd there's leadership,
p408
aVbut there's no one leader.
p409
aa(lp410
VNow, is this some kind of fanciful analogy,
p411
aVor could we actually learn something from this?
p412
aVWell, the murmuration functions to record
p413
aVa number of principles,
p414
aVand they're basically the principles that
p415
aVI have described to you today.
p416
aVThis is a huge collaboration.
p417
aVIt's an openness, it's a sharing
p418
aVof all kinds of information, not just about location
p419
aVand trajectory and danger and so on, but about food sources.
p420
aVAnd there's a real sense of interdependence,
p421
aVthat the individual birds somehow understand
p422
aVthat their interests are in the interest of the collective.
p423
aa(lp424
VPerhaps like we should understand
p425
aVthat business can't succeed
p426
aVin a world that's failing.
p427
aa(lp428
VWell, I look at this thing,
p429
aVand I get a lot of hope.
p430
aVThink about the kids today in the Arab Spring, and
p431
aVyou see something like this that's underway.
p432
aa(lp433
VAnd imagine, just consider this idea, if you would:
p434
aVWhat if we could connect ourselves in this world
p435
aVthrough a vast network of air and glass?
p436
aVCould we go beyond just sharing information and knowledge?
p437
aVCould we start to share our intelligence?
p438
aVCould we create some kind of
p439
aVcollective intelligence
p440
aVthat goes beyond an individual or a group or a team
p441
aVto create, perhaps, some kind of consciousness
p442
aVon a global basis?
p443
aVWell, if we could do this, we could attack some big problems in the world.
p444
aa(lp445
VAnd I look at this thing,
p446
aVand, I don't know, I get a lot of hope that maybe this
p447
aVsmaller, networked, open world
p448
aVthat our kids inherit might be a better one, and that
p449
aVthis new age of networked intelligence could be
p450
aVan age of promise fulfilled
p451
aVand of peril unrequited.
p452
