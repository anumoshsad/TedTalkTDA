VIf you go on the TED website,
p4
aVyou can currently find there
p5
aVover a full week of TEDTalk videos,
p6
aVover 1.3 million
p7
aVwords of transcripts
p8
aVand millions of user ratings.
p9
aVAnd that's a huge amount of data.
p10
aVAnd it got me wondering:
p11
aVIf you took all this data
p12
aVand put it through statistical analysis,
p13
aVcould you reverse engineer a TEDTalk?
p14
aVCould you create
p15
aVthe ultimate TEDTalk?
p16
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p17
aVAnd also, could you create
p18
aVthe worst possible TEDTalk
p19
aVthat they would still let you get away with?
p20
aa(lp21
VTo find this out, I looked at three things:
p22
aVI looked at the topic that you should choose,
p23
aVI looked at how you should deliver it
p24
aVand the visuals onstage.
p25
aVNow, with the topic: There's a whole range of topics you can choose,
p26
aVbut you should choose wisely,
p27
aVbecause your topic strongly correlates
p28
aVwith how users will react to your talk.
p29
aVNow, to make this more concrete,
p30
aVlet's look at the list of top 10 words
p31
aVthat statistically stick out
p32
aVin the most favorite TEDTalks
p33
aVand in the least favorite TEDTalks.
p34
aVSo if you came here
p35
aVto talk about how French coffee
p36
aVwill spread happiness in our brains,
p37
aVthat's a go.
p38
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p39
aVWhereas, if you wanted to talk about
p40
aVyour project involving
p41
aVoxygen, girls, aircraft \u2014
p42
aVactually, I would like to hear that talk, (Laughter)
p43
aVbut statistics say it's not so good.
p44
aVOh, well.
p45
aVIf you generalize this,
p46
aVthe most favorite TEDTalks are those
p47
aVthat feature topics we can connect with,
p48
aVboth easily and deeply,
p49
aVsuch as happiness, our own body,
p50
aVfood, emotions.
p51
aVAnd the more technical topics,
p52
aVsuch as architecture, materials and, strangely enough, men,
p53
aVthose are not good topics to talk about.
p54
aa(lp55
VHow should you deliver your talk?
p56
aVTED is famous for keeping
p57
aVa very sharp eye on the clock,
p58
aVso they're going to hate me
p59
aVfor revealing this, because, actually,
p60
aVyou should talk as long as they will let you. (Laughter)
p61
aVBecause the most favorite TEDTalks
p62
aVare, on average, over 50 percent longer
p63
aVthan the least favorite ones.
p64
aVAnd this holds true for all ranking lists on TED.com
p65
aVexcept if you want to have a talk
p66
aVthat's beautiful, inspiring or funny.
p67
aVThen, you should be brief. (Laughter) But other than that,
p68
aVtalk until they drag you off the stage.
p69
aa(lp70
V(Laughter)
p71
aa(lp72
VNow, while ...
p73
aV(Applause)
p74
aVWhile you're pushing the clock, there's a few rules to obey.
p75
aVI found these rules out by comparing the statistics
p76
aVof four-word phrases
p77
aVthat appear more often in the most favorite TEDTalks
p78
aVas opposed to the least favorite TEDTalks.
p79
aVI'll give you three examples.
p80
aVFirst of all, I must, as a speaker,
p81
aVprovide a service to the audience and talk about what I will give you,
p82
aVinstead of saying what I can't have.
p83
aVSecondly, it's imperative
p84
aVthat you do not cite The New York Times.
p85
aV(Laughter)
p86
aVAnd finally, it's okay for the speaker \u2014 that's the good news \u2014
p87
aVto fake intellectual capacity.
p88
aVIf I don't understand something, I can just say, "etc., etc."
p89
aVYou'll all stay with me.
p90
aVIt's perfectly fine.
p91
aV(Applause)
p92
aa(lp93
VNow, let's go to the visuals.
p94
aVThe most obvious visual thing on stage is the speaker.
p95
aVAnd analysis shows if you want to be
p96
aVamong the most favorite TED speakers,
p97
aVyou should let your hair grow a little bit longer than average,
p98
aVmake sure you wear your glasses and be slightly more dressed-up
p99
aVthan the average TED speaker.
p100
aVSlides are okay, though you might consider going for props.
p101
aVAnd now the most important thing,
p102
aVthat is the mood onstage.
p103
aVColor plays a very important role.
p104
aVColor closely correlates
p105
aVwith the ratings that talks get on the website.
p106
aV(Applause)
p107
aVFor example, fascinating talks
p108
aVcontain a statistically high amount
p109
aVof exactly this blue color, (Laughter)
p110
aVmuch more than the average TEDTalk.
p111
aVIngenious TEDTalks, much more this green color,
p112
aVetc., et.
p113
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p114
aVNow, personally, I think
p115
aVI'm not the first one who has done this analysis,
p116
aVbut I'll leave this
p117
aVto your good judgment.
p118
aa(lp119
VSo, now it's time to put it all together
p120
aVand design the ultimate TEDTalk.
p121
aVNow, since this is TEDActive,
p122
aVand I learned from my analysis
p123
aVthat I should actually give you something,
p124
aVI will not impose the ultimate
p125
aVor worst TEDTalk on you,
p126
aVbut rather give you a tool to create your own.
p127
aVAnd I call this tool the TEDPad.
p128
aV(Laughter)
p129
aVAnd the TEDPad is a matrix
p130
aVof 100 specifically selected,
p131
aVhighly curated sentences
p132
aVthat you can easily piece together to get your own TEDTalk.
p133
aVYou only have to make one decision,
p134
aVand that is: Are you going to use the white version
p135
aVfor very good TEDTalks,
p136
aVabout creativity, human genius?
p137
aVOr are you going to go with a black version,
p138
aVwhich will allow you to create really bad TEDTalks,
p139
aVmostly about blogs,
p140
aVpolitics and stuff?
p141
aVSo, download it and have fun with it.
p142
aa(lp143
VNow I hope you enjoy the session.
p144
aVI hope you enjoy designing your own
p145
aVultimate and worst possible TEDTalks.
p146
aVAnd I hope some of you will be inspired for next year
p147
aVto create this, which I really want to see.
p148
aa(lp149
VThank you very much.
p150
aa(lp151
V(Applause) Thanks.
