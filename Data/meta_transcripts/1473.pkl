VLike most journalists, I'm an idealist.
p4
aVI love unearthing good stories, especially untold stories.
p5
aVI just didn't think that in 2011,
p6
aVwomen would still be in that category.
p7
aa(lp8
VI'm the President of the Journalism and Women Symposium \u2014 JAWS.
p9
aVThat's Sharky.
p10
aa(lp11
V(Laughter)
p12
aa(lp13
VI joined 10 years ago because I wanted female role models,
p14
aVand I was frustrated by the lagging status of women in our profession
p15
aVand what that meant for our image in the media.
p16
aVWe make up half the population of the world,
p17
aVbut we're just 24 percent of the news subjects
p18
aVquoted in news stories.
p19
aVAnd we're just 20 percent of the experts quoted in stories.
p20
aVAnd now, with today's technology,
p21
aVit's possible to remove women from the picture completely.
p22
aa(lp23
VThis is a picture of President Barack Obama and his advisors,
p24
aVtracking the killing of Osama bin Laden.
p25
aVYou can see Hillary Clinton on the right.
p26
aVLet's see how the photo ran
p27
aVin an Orthodox Jewish newspaper based in Brooklyn.
p28
aVHillary's completely gone.
p29
aa(lp30
V(Laughter)
p31
aa(lp32
VThe paper apologized, but said it never runs photos of women;
p33
aVthey might be sexually provocative.
p34
aa(lp35
V(Laughter)
p36
aa(lp37
VThis is an extreme case, yes.
p38
aVBut the fact is,
p39
aVwomen are only 19 percent of the sources in stories on politics,
p40
aVand only 20 percent in stories on the economy.
p41
aVThe news continues to give us a picture
p42
aVwhere men outnumber women
p43
aVin nearly all occupational categories, except two:
p44
aVstudents and homemakers.
p45
aa(lp46
V(Laughter)
p47
aa(lp48
VSo we all get a very distorted picture of reality.
p49
aVThe problem is, of course, there aren't enough women in newsrooms.
p50
aVThey report at just 37 percent of stories in print, TV and radio.
p51
aVEven in stories on gender-based violence,
p52
aVmen get an overwhelming majority of print space and airtime.
p53
aa(lp54
VCase in point:
p55
aVThis March, the New York Times ran a story by James McKinley
p56
aVabout a gang rape of a young girl,
p57
aV11 years old, in a small Texas town.
p58
aVMcKinley writes that the community is wondering,
p59
aV"How could their boys have been drawn into this?"
p60
aV"Drawn into this" \u2014
p61
aVlike they were seduced into committing an act of violence.
p62
aVAnd the first person he quotes says,
p63
aV"These boys will have to live with this the rest of their lives."
p64
aV(Groans, laughter)
p65
aVYou don't hear much about the 11-year-old victim,
p66
aVexcept that she wore clothes that were a little old for her
p67
aVand she wore makeup.
p68
aa(lp69
VThe Times was deluged with criticism.
p70
aVInitially, it defended itself,
p71
aVand said, "These aren't our views.
p72
aVThis is what we found in our reporting."
p73
aVNow, here's a secret you probably know already:
p74
aVYour stories are constructed.
p75
aVAs reporters, we research, we interview.
p76
aVWe try to give a good picture of reality.
p77
aVWe also have our own unconscious biases.
p78
aVBut The Times makes it sound like anyone would have reported this story
p79
aVthe same way.
p80
aVI disagree with that.
p81
aa(lp82
VSo three weeks later,
p83
aVThe Times revisits the story.
p84
aVThis time, it adds another byline to it with McKinley's:
p85
aVErica Goode.
p86
aVWhat emerges is a truly sad, horrific tale
p87
aVof a young girl and her family trapped in poverty.
p88
aVShe was raped numerous times by many men.
p89
aVShe had been a bright, easygoing girl.
p90
aVShe was maturing quickly, physically,
p91
aVbut her bed was still covered with stuffed animals.
p92
aVIt's a very different picture.
p93
aVPerhaps the addition of Ms. Goode is what made this story more complete.
p94
aa(lp95
VThe Global Media Monitoring Project has found that stories by female reporters
p96
aVare more likely to challenge stereotypes than those by male reporters.
p97
aVAt KUNM here in Albuquerque,
p98
aVElaine Baumgartel did some graduate research
p99
aVon the coverage of violence against women.
p100
aVWhat she found was many of these stories tend to blame victims
p101
aVand devalue their lives.
p102
aVThey tend to sensationalize, and they lack context.
p103
aVSo for her graduate work,
p104
aVshe did a three-part series on the murder of 11 women,
p105
aVfound buried on Albuquerque's West Mesa.
p106
aVShe tried to challenge those patterns and stereotypes in her work
p107
aVand she tried to show the challenges that journalists face
p108
aVfrom external sources, their own internal biases
p109
aVand cultural norms.
p110
aVAnd she worked with an editor at National Public Radio
p111
aVto try to get a story aired nationally.
p112
aVShe's not sure that would have happened if the editor had not been a female.
p113
aa(lp114
VStories in the news
p115
aVare more than twice as likely to present women as victims than men,
p116
aVand women are more likely to be defined by their body parts.
p117
aVWired magazine, November 2010.
p118
aVYes, the issue was about breast-tissue engineering.
p119
aVNow I know you're all distracted, so I'll take that off.
p120
aa(lp121
V(Laughter)
p122
aa(lp123
VEyes up here.
p124
aa(lp125
V(Laughter)
p126
aa(lp127
VSo \u2014
p128
aa(lp129
V(Applause)
p130
aa(lp131
VHere's the thing:
p132
aVWired almost never puts women on its cover.
p133
aVOh, there have been some gimmicky ones \u2014
p134
aVPam from "The Office,"
p135
aVmanga girls,
p136
aVa voluptuous model covered in synthetic diamonds.
p137
aVTexas State University professor Cindy Royal wondered in her blog
p138
aVhow are young women like her students supposed to feel about their roles
p139
aVin technology, reading Wired.
p140
aVChris Anderson, the editor of Wired, defended his choice
p141
aVand said there aren't enough women, prominent women
p142
aVin technology to sell a cover, to sell an issue.
p143
aVPart of that is true,
p144
aVthere aren't as many prominent women in technology.
p145
aa(lp146
VHere's my problem with that argument:
p147
aVMedia tells us every day what's important,
p148
aVby the stories they choose and where they place them;
p149
aVit's called agenda setting.
p150
aVHow many people knew the founders of Facebook and Google
p151
aVbefore their faces were on a magazine cover?
p152
aVPutting them there made them more recognizable.
p153
aa(lp154
VNow, Fast Company Magazine embraces that idea.
p155
aVThis is its cover from November 15, 2010.
p156
aVThe issue is about the most prominent and influential women in technology.
p157
aVEditor Robert Safian told the Poynter Institute,
p158
aV"Silicon Valley is very white and very male.
p159
aVBut that's not what Fast Company thinks
p160
aVthe business world will look like in the future,
p161
aVso it tries to give a picture of where the globalized world is moving."
p162
aa(lp163
VBy the way, apparently, Wired took all this to heart.
p164
aVThis was its issue in April.
p165
aa(lp166
V(Laughter)
p167
aa(lp168
VThat's Limor Fried, the founder of Adafruit Industries,
p169
aVin the Rosie the Riveter pose.
p170
aa(lp171
VIt would help to have more women in positions of leadership in media.
p172
aVA recent global survey
p173
aVfound that 73 percent of the top media-management jobs
p174
aVare still held by men.
p175
aVBut this is also about something far more complex:
p176
aVour own unconscious biases and blind spots.
p177
aa(lp178
VShankar Vedantam is the author
p179
aVof "The Hidden Brain: How Our Unconscious Minds Elect Presidents,
p180
aVControl Markets, Wage Wars, and Save Our Lives."
p181
aVHe told the former ombudsman at National Public Radio,
p182
aVwho was doing a report on how women fare in NPR coverage,
p183
aVunconscious bias flows throughout most of our lives.
p184
aVIt's really difficult to disentangle those strands.
p185
aVBut he did have one suggestion.
p186
aVHe used to work for two editors
p187
aVwho said every story had to have at least one female source.
p188
aVHe balked at first,
p189
aVbut said he eventually followed the directive happily,
p190
aVbecause his stories got better
p191
aVand his job got easier.
p192
aa(lp193
VNow, I don't know if one of the editors was a woman,
p194
aVbut that can make the biggest difference.
p195
aVThe Dallas Morning News won a Pulitzer Prize in 1994
p196
aVfor a series it did on women around the world,
p197
aVbut one of the reporters told me
p198
aVshe's convinced it never would have happened
p199
aVif they had not had a female assistant foreign editor,
p200
aVand they would not have gotten some of those stories
p201
aVwithout female reporters and editors on the ground,
p202
aVparticularly one on female genital mutilation \u2014
p203
aVmen would just not be allowed into those situations.
p204
aa(lp205
VThis is an important point to consider,
p206
aVbecause much of our foreign policy now revolves around countries
p207
aVwhere the treatment of women is an issue,
p208
aVsuch as Afghanistan.
p209
aVWhat we're told in terms of arguments against leaving this country
p210
aVis that the fate of the women is primary.
p211
aVNow, I'm sure a male reporter in Kabul can find women to interview.
p212
aVNot so sure about rural, traditional areas,
p213
aVwhere I'm guessing women can't talk to strange men.
p214
aa(lp215
VIt's important to keep talking about this, in light of Lara Logan.
p216
aVShe was the CBS News correspondent
p217
aVwho was brutally sexually assaulted in Egypt's Tahrir Square,
p218
aVright after this photo was taken.
p219
aVAlmost immediately, pundits weighed in,
p220
aVblaming her and saying things like,
p221
aV"You know, maybe women shouldn't be sent to cover those stories."
p222
aVI never heard anyone say this about Anderson Cooper and his crew,
p223
aVwho were attacked covering the same story.
p224
aa(lp225
VOne way to get more women into leadership
p226
aVis to have other women mentor them.
p227
aVOne of my board members is an editor at a major global media company,
p228
aVbut she never thought about this as a career path,
p229
aVuntil she met female role models at JAWS.
p230
aa(lp231
VBut this is not just a job for super-journalists
p232
aVor my organization.
p233
aVYou all have a stake in a strong, vibrant media.
p234
aVAnalyze your news.
p235
aVAnd speak up when there are gaps missing in coverage,
p236
aVlike people at The New York Times did.
p237
aVSuggest female sources to reporters and editors.
p238
aVRemember \u2014 a complete picture of reality may depend upon it.
p239
aa(lp240
VAnd I'll leave you with a video clip
p241
aVthat I first saw in [1987] when I was a student in London.
p242
aVIt's for The Guardian newspaper.
p243
aVIt's actually long before I ever thought about becoming a journalist,
p244
aVbut I was very interested in how we learn to perceive our world.
p245
aVNarrator: An event seen from one point of view gives one impression.
p246
aVSeen from another point of view,
p247
aVit gives quite a different impression.
p248
aVBut it's only when you get the whole picture,
p249
aVyou can fully understand what's going on.
