VJust after Christmas last year,
p4
aV132 kids in California got the measles
p5
aVby either visiting Disneyland
p6
aVor being exposed to someone who'd been there.
p7
aVThe virus then hopped the Canadian border,
p8
aVinfecting more than 100 children in Quebec.
p9
aVOne of the tragic things about this outbreak
p10
aVis that measles, which can be fatal to a child with a weakened immune system,
p11
aVis one of the most easily preventable diseases in the world.
p12
aVAn effective vaccine against it
p13
aVhas been available for more than half a century,
p14
aVbut many of the kids involved in the Disneyland outbreak
p15
aVhad not been vaccinated
p16
aVbecause their parents were afraid
p17
aVof something allegedly even worse:
p18
aVautism.
p19
aa(lp20
VBut wait \u2014 wasn't the paper that sparked the controversy
p21
aVabout autism and vaccines
p22
aVdebunked, retracted,
p23
aVand branded a deliberate fraud
p24
aVby the British Medical Journal?
p25
aVDon't most science-savvy people
p26
aVknow that the theory that vaccines cause autism is B.S.?
p27
aVI think most of you do,
p28
aVbut millions of parents worldwide
p29
aVcontinue to fear that vaccines put their kids at risk for autism.
p30
aa(lp31
VWhy?
p32
aVHere's why.
p33
aVThis is a graph of autism prevalence estimates rising over time.
p34
aVFor most of the 20th century,
p35
aVautism was considered an incredibly rare condition.
p36
aVThe few psychologists and pediatricians who'd even heard of it
p37
aVfigured they would get through their entire careers
p38
aVwithout seeing a single case.
p39
aVFor decades, the prevalence estimates remained stable
p40
aVat just three or four children in 10,000.
p41
aVBut then, in the 1990s,
p42
aVthe numbers started to skyrocket.
p43
aVFundraising organizations like Autism Speaks
p44
aVroutinely refer to autism as an epidemic,
p45
aVas if you could catch it from another kid at Disneyland.
p46
aa(lp47
VSo what's going on?
p48
aVIf it isn't vaccines, what is it?
p49
aVIf you ask the folks down at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta
p50
aVwhat's going on,
p51
aVthey tend to rely on phrases like "broadened diagnostic criteria"
p52
aVand "better case finding"
p53
aVto explain these rising numbers.
p54
aVBut that kind of language
p55
aVdoesn't do much to allay the fears of a young mother
p56
aVwho is searching her two-year-old's face for eye contact.
p57
aVIf the diagnostic criteria had to be broadened,
p58
aVwhy were they so narrow in the first place?
p59
aVWhy were cases of autism so hard to find
p60
aVbefore the 1990s?
p61
aa(lp62
VFive years ago, I decided to try to uncover the answers to these questions.
p63
aVI learned that what happened
p64
aVhas less to do with the slow and cautious progress of science
p65
aVthan it does with the seductive power of storytelling.
p66
aVFor most of the 20th century,
p67
aVclinicians told one story
p68
aVabout what autism is and how it was discovered,
p69
aVbut that story turned out to be wrong,
p70
aVand the consequences of it
p71
aVare having a devastating impact on global public health.
p72
aVThere was a second, more accurate story of autism
p73
aVwhich had been lost and forgotten
p74
aVin obscure corners of the clinical literature.
p75
aVThis second story tells us everything about how we got here
p76
aVand where we need to go next.
p77
aa(lp78
VThe first story starts with a child psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins Hospital
p79
aVnamed Leo Kanner.
p80
aVIn 1943, Kanner published a paper
p81
aVdescribing 11 young patients who seemed to inhabit private worlds,
p82
aVignoring the people around them,
p83
aVeven their own parents.
p84
aVThey could amuse themselves for hours
p85
aVby flapping their hands in front of their faces,
p86
aVbut they were panicked by little things
p87
aVlike their favorite toy being moved from its usual place
p88
aVwithout their knowledge.
p89
aVBased on the patients who were brought to his clinic,
p90
aVKanner speculated that autism is very rare.
p91
aVBy the 1950s, as the world's leading authority on the subject,
p92
aVhe declared that he had seen less than 150 true cases of his syndrome
p93
aVwhile fielding referrals from as far away as South Africa.
p94
aVThat's actually not surprising,
p95
aVbecause Kanner's criteria for diagnosing autism
p96
aVwere incredibly selective.
p97
aVFor example, he discouraged giving the diagnosis to children who had seizures
p98
aVbut now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
p99
aVHe once bragged that he had turned nine out of 10 kids
p100
aVreferred to his office as autistic by other clinicians
p101
aVwithout giving them an autism diagnosis.
p102
aa(lp103
VKanner was a smart guy,
p104
aVbut a number of his theories didn't pan out.
p105
aVHe classified autism as a form of infantile psychosis
p106
aVcaused by cold and unaffectionate parents.
p107
aVThese children, he said,
p108
aVhad been kept neatly in a refrigerator that didn't defrost.
p109
aVAt the same time, however,
p110
aVKanner noticed that some of his young patients
p111
aVhad special abilities that clustered in certain areas
p112
aVlike music, math and memory.
p113
aVOne boy in his clinic
p114
aVcould distinguish between 18 symphonies before he turned two.
p115
aVWhen his mother put on one of his favorite records,
p116
aVhe would correctly declare, "Beethoven!"
p117
aVBut Kanner took a dim view of these abilities,
p118
aVclaiming that the kids were just regurgitating things
p119
aVthey'd heard their pompous parents say,
p120
aVdesperate to earn their approval.
p121
aVAs a result, autism became a source of shame and stigma for families,
p122
aVand two generations of autistic children
p123
aVwere shipped off to institutions for their own good,
p124
aVbecoming invisible to the world at large.
p125
aa(lp126
VAmazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s
p127
aVthat researchers began to test Kanner's theory that autism was rare.
p128
aVLorna Wing was a cognitive psychologist in London
p129
aVwho thought that Kanner's theory of refrigerator parenting
p130
aVwere "bloody stupid," as she told me.
p131
aVShe and her husband John were warm and affectionate people,
p132
aVand they had a profoundly autistic daughter named Susie.
p133
aVLorna and John knew how hard it was to raise a child like Susie
p134
aVwithout support services,
p135
aVspecial education,
p136
aVand the other resources that are out of reach without a diagnosis.
p137
aVTo make the case to the National Health Service
p138
aVthat more resources were needed for autistic children and their families,
p139
aa(lp140
VLorna and her colleague Judith Gould
p141
aVdecided to do something that should have been done 30 years earlier.
p142
aVThey undertook a study of autism prevalence in the general population.
p143
aVThey pounded the pavement in a London suburb called Camberwell
p144
aVto try to find autistic children in the community.
p145
aVWhat they saw made clear that Kanner's model was way too narrow,
p146
aVwhile the reality of autism was much more colorful and diverse.
p147
aVSome kids couldn't talk at all,
p148
aVwhile others waxed on at length about their fascination with astrophysics,
p149
aVdinosaurs or the genealogy of royalty.
p150
aVIn other words, these children didn't fit into nice, neat boxes,
p151
aVas Judith put it,
p152
aVand they saw lots of them,
p153
aVway more than Kanner's monolithic model would have predicted.
p154
aa(lp155
VAt first, they were at a loss to make sense of their data.
p156
aVHow had no one noticed these children before?
p157
aVBut then Lorna came upon a reference to a paper that had been published
p158
aVin German in 1944,
p159
aVthe year after Kanner's paper,
p160
aVand then forgotten,
p161
aVburied with the ashes of a terrible time
p162
aVthat no one wanted to remember or think about.
p163
aVKanner knew about this competing paper,
p164
aVbut scrupulously avoided mentioning it in his own work.
p165
aVIt had never even been translated into English,
p166
aVbut luckily, Lorna's husband spoke German,
p167
aVand he translated it for her.
p168
aa(lp169
VThe paper offered an alternate story of autism.
p170
aVIts author was a man named Hans Asperger,
p171
aVwho ran a combination clinic and residential school
p172
aVin Vienna in the 1930s.
p173
aVAsperger's ideas about teaching children with learning differences
p174
aVwere progressive even by contemporary standards.
p175
aVMornings at his clinic began with exercise classes set to music,
p176
aVand the children put on plays on Sunday afternoons.
p177
aVInstead of blaming parents for causing autism,
p178
aVAsperger framed it as a lifelong, polygenetic disability
p179
aVthat requires compassionate forms of support and accommodations
p180
aVover the course of one's whole life.
p181
aVRather than treating the kids in his clinic like patients,
p182
aVAsperger called them his little professors,
p183
aVand enlisted their help in developing methods of education
p184
aVthat were particularly suited to them.
p185
aVCrucially, Asperger viewed autism as a diverse continuum
p186
aVthat spans an astonishing range of giftedness and disability.
p187
aVHe believed that autism and autistic traits are common
p188
aVand always have been,
p189
aVseeing aspects of this continuum in familiar archetypes from pop culture
p190
aVlike the socially awkward scientist
p191
aVand the absent-minded professor.
p192
aVHe went so far as to say,
p193
aVit seems that for success in science and art,
p194
aVa dash of autism is essential.
p195
aa(lp196
VLorna and Judith realized that Kanner had been as wrong about autism being rare
p197
aVas he had been about parents causing it.
p198
aVOver the next several years,
p199
aVthey quietly worked with the American Psychiatric Association
p200
aVto broaden the criteria for diagnosis
p201
aVto reflect the diversity of what they called "the autism spectrum."
p202
aVIn the late '80s and early 1990s,
p203
aVtheir changes went into effect,
p204
aVswapping out Kanner's narrow model
p205
aVfor Asperger's broad and inclusive one.
p206
aa(lp207
VThese changes weren't happening in a vacuum.
p208
aVBy coincidence, as Lorna and Judith worked behind the scenes
p209
aVto reform the criteria,
p210
aVpeople all over the world were seeing an autistic adult for the first time.
p211
aVBefore "Rain Man" came out in 1988,
p212
aVonly a tiny, ingrown circle of experts knew what autism looked like,
p213
aVbut after Dustin Hoffman's unforgettable performance as Raymond Babbitt
p214
aVearned "Rain Man" four Academy Awards,
p215
aVpediatricians, psychologists,
p216
aVteachers and parents all over the world knew what autism looked like.
p217
aa(lp218
VCoincidentally, at the same time,
p219
aVthe first easy-to-use clinical tests for diagnosing autism were introduced.
p220
aVYou no longer had to have a connection to that tiny circle of experts
p221
aVto get your child evaluated.
p222
aa(lp223
VThe combination of "Rain Man,"
p224
aVthe changes to the criteria, and the introduction of these tests
p225
aVcreated a network effect,
p226
aVa perfect storm of autism awareness.
p227
aVThe number of diagnoses started to soar,
p228
aVjust as Lorna and Judith predicted, indeed hoped, that it would,
p229
aVenabling autistic people and their families
p230
aVto finally get the support and services they deserved.
p231
aa(lp232
VThen Andrew Wakefield came along
p233
aVto blame the spike in diagnoses on vaccines,
p234
aVa simple, powerful,
p235
aVand seductively believable story
p236
aVthat was as wrong as Kanner's theory
p237
aVthat autism was rare.
p238
aa(lp239
VIf the CDC's current estimate,
p240
aVthat one in 68 kids in America are on the spectrum, is correct,
p241
aVautistics are one of the largest minority groups in the world.
p242
aVIn recent years, autistic people have come together on the Internet
p243
aVto reject the notion that they are puzzles to be solved
p244
aVby the next medical breakthrough,
p245
aVcoining the term "neurodiversity"
p246
aVto celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
p247
aa(lp248
VOne way to understand neurodiversity
p249
aVis to think in terms of human operating systems.
p250
aVJust because a P.C. is not running Windows doesn't mean that it's broken.
p251
aVBy autistic standards, the normal human brain
p252
aVis easily distractable,
p253
aVobsessively social,
p254
aVand suffers from a deficit of attention to detail.
p255
aVTo be sure, autistic people have a hard time
p256
aVliving in a world not built for them.
p257
aV[Seventy] years later, we're still catching up to Asperger,
p258
aVwho believed that the "cure" for the most disabling aspects of autism
p259
aVis to be found in understanding teachers,
p260
aVaccommodating employers,
p261
aVsupportive communities,
p262
aVand parents who have faith in their children's potential.
p263
aa(lp264
VAn autistic [man] named Zosia Zaks once said,
p265
aV"We need all hands on deck to right the ship of humanity."
p266
aVAs we sail into an uncertain future,
p267
aVwe need every form of human intelligence on the planet
p268
aVworking together to tackle the challenges that we face as a society.
p269
aVWe can't afford to waste a brain.
p270
aa(lp271
