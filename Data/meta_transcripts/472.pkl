VI was raised in Seoul, Korea,
p4
aVand moved to New York City in 1999 to attend college.
p5
aVI was pre-med at the time,
p6
aVand I thought I would become a surgeon
p7
aVbecause I was interested in anatomy
p8
aVand dissecting animals really piqued my curiosity.
p9
aVAt the same time, I fell in love with New York City.
p10
aVI started to realize that I could look at the whole city
p11
aVas a living organism.
p12
aVI wanted to dissect it
p13
aVand look into its unseen layers.
p14
aVAnd the way to it, for me,
p15
aVwas through artistic means.
p16
aVSo, eventually I decided to pursue an MFA instead of an M.D.
p17
aVand in grad school I became interested
p18
aVin creatures that dwell in the hidden corners of the city.
p19
aa(lp20
VIn New York City, rats are part of commuters' daily lives.
p21
aVMost people ignore them or are frightened of them.
p22
aVBut I took a liking to them
p23
aVbecause they dwell on the fringes of society.
p24
aVAnd even though they're used in labs to promote human lives,
p25
aVthey're also considered pests.
p26
aVI also started looking around in the city
p27
aVand trying to photograph them.
p28
aVOne day, in the subway, I was snapping pictures of the tracks
p29
aVhoping to catch a rat or two,
p30
aVand a man came up to me and said,
p31
aV"You can't take photographs here.
p32
aVThe MTA will confiscate your camera."
p33
aVI was quite shocked by that,
p34
aVand thought to myself, "Well, OK then.
p35
aVI'll follow the rats."
p36
aVThen I started going into the tunnels,
p37
aVwhich made me realize that there's a whole new dimension to the city
p38
aVthat I never saw before and most people don't get to see.
p39
aa(lp40
VAround the same time, I met like-minded individuals
p41
aVwho call themselves urban explorers, adventurers, spelunkers,
p42
aVguerrilla historians, etc.
p43
aVI was welcomed into this loose, Internet-based network
p44
aVof people who regularly explore urban ruins
p45
aVsuch as abandoned subway stations,
p46
aVtunnels, sewers, aqueducts,
p47
aVfactories, hospitals, shipyards and so on.
p48
aa(lp49
VWhen I took photographs in these locations,
p50
aVI felt there was something missing in the pictures.
p51
aVSimply documenting these soon-to-be-demolished structures
p52
aVwasn't enough for me.
p53
aVSo I wanted to create a fictional character
p54
aVor an animal that dwells in these underground spaces,
p55
aVand the simplest way to do it, at the time,
p56
aVwas to model myself.
p57
aVI decided against clothing
p58
aVbecause I wanted the figure to be without any cultural implications
p59
aVor time-specific elements.
p60
aVI wanted a simple way to represent a living body
p61
aVinhabiting these decaying, derelict spaces.
p62
aa(lp63
VThis was taken in the Riviera Sugar Factory in Red Hook, Brooklyn.
p64
aVIt's now an empty, six-acre lot
p65
aVwaiting for a shopping mall right across from the new Ikea.
p66
aVI was very fond of this space
p67
aVbecause it's the first massive industrial complex I found on my own
p68
aVthat is abandoned.
p69
aVWhen I first went in, I was scared,
p70
aVbecause I heard dogs barking and I thought they were guard dogs.
p71
aVBut they happened to be wild dogs living there,
p72
aVand it was right by the water,
p73
aVso there were swans and ducks swimming around
p74
aVand trees growing everywhere
p75
aVand bees nesting in the sugar barrels.
p76
aa(lp77
VThe nature had really reclaimed the whole complex.
p78
aVAnd, in a way, I wanted the human figure in the picture
p79
aVto become a part of that nature.
p80
aVWhen I got comfortable in the space,
p81
aVit also felt like a big playground.
p82
aVI would climb up the tanks and hop across exposed beams
p83
aVas if I went back in time and became a child again.
p84
aa(lp85
VThis was taken in the old Croton Aqueduct,
p86
aVwhich supplied fresh water to New York City for the first time.
p87
aVThe construction began in 1837.
p88
aVIt lasted about five years.
p89
aVIt got abandoned when the new Croton Aqueducts opened in 1890.
p90
aVWhen you go into spaces like this,
p91
aVyou're directly accessing the past,
p92
aVbecause they sit untouched for decades.
p93
aVI love feeling the aura of a space that has so much history.
p94
aVInstead of looking at reproductions of it at home,
p95
aVyou're actually feeling the hand-laid bricks
p96
aVand shimmying up and down narrow cracks
p97
aVand getting wet and muddy
p98
aVand walking in a dark tunnel with a flashlight.
p99
aa(lp100
VThis is a tunnel underneath Riverside Park.
p101
aVIt was built in the 1930s by Robert Moses.
p102
aVThe murals were done by a graffiti artist
p103
aVto commemorate the hundreds of homeless people
p104
aVthat got relocated from the tunnel in 1991
p105
aVwhen the tunnel reopened for trains.
p106
aVWalking in this tunnel is very peaceful.
p107
aVThere's nobody around you,
p108
aVand you hear the kids playing in the park above you,
p109
aVcompletely unaware of what's underneath.
p110
aa(lp111
VWhen I was going out a lot to these places,
p112
aVI was feeling a lot of anxiety and isolation
p113
aVbecause I was in a solitary phase in my life,
p114
aVand I decided to title my series "Naked City Spleen,"
p115
aVwhich references Charles Baudelaire.
p116
aV"Naked City" is a nickname for New York,
p117
aVand "Spleen" embodies the melancholia and inertia
p118
aVthat come from feeling alienated in an urban environment.
p119
aa(lp120
VThis is the same tunnel.
p121
aVYou see the sunbeams coming from the ventilation ducts
p122
aVand the train approaching.
p123
aa(lp124
VThis is a tunnel that's abandoned in Hell's Kitchen.
p125
aVI was there alone, setting up,
p126
aVand a homeless man approached.
p127
aVI was basically intruding in his living space.
p128
aVI was really frightened at first,
p129
aVbut I calmly explained to him that I was working on an art project
p130
aVand he didn't seem to mind
p131
aVand so I went ahead and put my camera on self-timer
p132
aVand ran back and forth.
p133
aVAnd when I was done, he actually offered me his shirt
p134
aVto wipe off my feet
p135
aVand kindly walked me out.
p136
aVIt must have been a very unusual day for him.
p137
aV(Laughter)
p138
aa(lp139
VOne thing that struck me, after this incident,
p140
aVwas that a space like that holds so many deleted memories of the city.
p141
aVThat homeless man, to me, really represented
p142
aVan element of the unconscious of the city.
p143
aVHe told me that he was abused above ground
p144
aVand was once in Riker's Island,
p145
aVand at last he found peace and quiet in that space.
p146
aVThe tunnel was once built for the prosperity of the city,
p147
aVbut is now a sanctuary for outcasts,
p148
aVwho are completely forgotten in the average urban dweller's everyday life.
p149
aa(lp150
VThis is underneath my alma mater, Columbia University.
p151
aVThe tunnels are famous for having been used
p152
aVduring the development of the Manhattan Project.
p153
aVThis particular tunnel is interesting
p154
aVbecause it shows the original foundations of Bloomingdale Insane Asylum,
p155
aVwhich was demolished in 1890
p156
aVwhen Columbia moved in.
p157
aa(lp158
VThis is the New York City Farm Colony,
p159
aVwhich was a poorhouse in Staten Island
p160
aVfrom the 1890s to the 1930s.
p161
aVMost of my photos are set in places
p162
aVthat have been abandoned for decades,
p163
aVbut this is an exception.
p164
aa(lp165
VThis children's hospital was closed in 1997;
p166
aVit's located in Newark.
p167
aVWhen I was there three years ago,
p168
aVthe windows were broken and the walls were peeling,
p169
aVbut everything was left there as it was.
p170
aVYou see the autopsy table, morgue trays, x-ray machines
p171
aVand even used utensils,
p172
aVwhich you see on the autopsy table.
p173
aa(lp174
VAfter exploring recently-abandoned buildings,
p175
aVI felt that everything could fall into ruins very fast:
p176
aVyour home, your office, a shopping mall, a church \u2014
p177
aVany man-made structures around you.
p178
aVI was reminded of how fragile our sense of security is
p179
aVand how vulnerable people truly are.
p180
aa(lp181
VI love to travel,
p182
aVand Berlin has become one of my favorite cities.
p183
aVIt's full of history,
p184
aVand also full of underground bunkers
p185
aVand ruins from the war.
p186
aa(lp187
VThis was taken under a homeless asylum
p188
aVbuilt in 1885 to house 1,100 people.
p189
aVI saw the structure while I was on the train,
p190
aVand I got off at the next station and met people there
p191
aVthat gave me access to their catacomb-like basement,
p192
aVwhich was used for ammunition storage during the war
p193
aVand also, at some point, to hide groups of Jewish refugees.
p194
aVThis is the actual catacombs in Paris.
p195
aVI explored there extensively
p196
aVin the off-limits areas
p197
aVand fell in love right away.
p198
aa(lp199
VThere are more than 185 miles of tunnels,
p200
aVand only about a mile is open to the public as a museum.
p201
aVThe first tunnels date back to 60 B.C.
p202
aVThey were consistently dug as limestone quarries
p203
aVand by the 18th century,
p204
aVthe caving-in of some of these quarries posed safety threats,
p205
aVso the government ordered reinforcing of the existing quarries
p206
aVand dug new observation tunnels
p207
aVin order to monitor and map the whole place.
p208
aa(lp209
VAs you can see, the system is very complex and vast.
p210
aVIt's very dangerous to get lost in there.
p211
aVAnd at the same time,
p212
aVthere was a problem in the city with overflowing cemeteries.
p213
aVSo the bones were moved from the cemeteries into the quarries,
p214
aVmaking them into the catacombs.
p215
aVThe remains of over six million people are housed in there,
p216
aVsome over 1,300 years old.
p217
aVThis was taken under the Montparnasse Cemetery
p218
aVwhere most of the ossuaries are located.
p219
aVThere are also phone cables that were used in the '50s
p220
aVand many bunkers from the World War II era.
p221
aa(lp222
VThis is a German bunker.
p223
aVNearby there's a French bunker,
p224
aVand the whole tunnel system is so complex
p225
aVthat the two parties never met.
p226
aVThe tunnels are famous for having been used by the Resistance,
p227
aVwhich Victor Hugo wrote about in "Les Miserables."
p228
aVAnd I saw a lot of graffiti from the 1800s, like this one.
p229
aa(lp230
VAfter exploring the underground of Paris,
p231
aVI decided to climb up,
p232
aVand I climbed a Gothic monument
p233
aVthat's right in the middle of Paris.
p234
aVThis is the Tower of Saint Jacques.
p235
aVIt was built in the early 1500s.
p236
aVI don't recommend sitting on a gargoyle in the middle of January, naked.
p237
aVIt was not very comfortable. (Laughter)
p238
aa(lp239
VAnd all this time,
p240
aVI never saw a single rat in any of these places,
p241
aVuntil recently, when I was in the London sewers.
p242
aVThis was probably the toughest place to explore.
p243
aVI had to wear a gas mask because of the toxic fumes \u2014
p244
aVI guess, except for in this picture.
p245
aVAnd when the tides of waste matter come in
p246
aVit sounds as if a whole storm is approaching you.
p247
aa(lp248
VThis is a still from a film I worked on recently, called "Blind Door."
p249
aVI've become more interested in capturing movement and texture.
p250
aVAnd the 16mm black-and-white film gave a different feel to it.
p251
aa(lp252
VAnd this is the first theater project I worked on.
p253
aVI adapted and produced "A Dream Play" by August Strindberg.
p254
aVIt was performed last September one time only
p255
aVin the Atlantic Avenue tunnel in Brooklyn,
p256
aVwhich is considered to be the oldest underground train tunnel in the world,
p257
aVbuilt in 1844.
p258
aVI've been leaning towards more collaborative projects like these, lately.
p259
aVBut whenever I get a chance I still work on my series.
p260
aa(lp261
VThe last place I visited
p262
aVwas the Mayan ruins of Copan, Honduras.
p263
aVThis was taken inside an archaeological tunnel in the main temple.
p264
aa(lp265
VI like doing more than just exploring these spaces.
p266
aVI feel an obligation to animate and humanize these spaces continually
p267
aVin order to preserve their memories in a creative way \u2014
p268
aVbefore they're lost forever.
p269
aVThank you.
