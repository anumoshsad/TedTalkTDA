VI started with paragliding.
p4
aVParagliding is taking off from mountains
p5
aVwith a paraglider, with the possibility to
p6
aVfly cross-country, distance,
p7
aVjust with the use of thermals to soar.
p8
aVAlso different aerobatic maneuvers are possible
p9
aVwith a paraglider.
p10
aa(lp11
VFrom there I started with skydiving.
p12
aVIn this picture you can see
p13
aVthere is a four-way skydive,
p14
aVfour people flying together,
p15
aVand on the left hand side it's the camera flier
p16
aVwith the camera mounted to his helmet
p17
aVso he can film the whole jump,
p18
aVfor the film itself and also for the judging.
p19
aa(lp20
VFrom regular, relative skydiving
p21
aVI went on to freeflying.
p22
aVFreeflying is more the three-dimensional skydiving.
p23
aVYou can see the skydiver with the red suit,
p24
aVhe's in a stand-up position.
p25
aVThe one with the yellow-green suit,
p26
aVhe's flying head-down.
p27
aVAnd that's me in the background, carving around the whole formation
p28
aVin freefall also, with the helmet cam
p29
aVto film this jump.
p30
aa(lp31
VFrom freeflying I went on to skysurfing.
p32
aVSkysurfing is skydiving with a board on the feet.
p33
aVYou can imagine with this big surface
p34
aVof a skysurfing board,
p35
aVthere is a lot of force, a lot of power.
p36
aVOf course I can use this power
p37
aVfor example for nice spinning \u2014 we call it "helicopter moves."
p38
aa(lp39
VFrom there I went on to wingsuit flying.
p40
aVWingsuit flying is a suit,
p41
aVthat I can make fly, just only with my body.
p42
aVIf I put some tension on my body, tension on my suit,
p43
aVI can make it fly. And as you see
p44
aVthe fall rate is much much slower
p45
aVbecause of the bigger surface.
p46
aVWith a proper body position I'm able to really move forward
p47
aVto gain quite some distance.
p48
aVThis is a jump I did in Rio de Janeiro.
p49
aVYou can see the Copacabana on the left-hand side.
p50
aa(lp51
VFrom there with all the skills and knowledge
p52
aVfrom paragliding and all the different disciplines
p53
aVin skydiving, I went on to BASE jumping.
p54
aVBASE jumping is skydiving from fixed objects,
p55
aVlike buildings, antennae, bridges and earth \u2014
p56
aVmeaning mountains, cliffs.
p57
aVIt's for sure \u2014 for me \u2014 it's the ultimate feeling
p58
aVof being in free fall,
p59
aVwith all the visual references.
p60
aa(lp61
VSo my goal soon was to discover new places
p62
aVthat nobody had jumped before.
p63
aVSo in summer 2000 I was the first to BASE jump
p64
aVthe Eiger North Face in Switzerland.
p65
aVTwo years after this, I was the first to BASE jump from Matterhorn,
p66
aVa very famous mountain that probably
p67
aVeverybody knows in here.
p68
aV2005 I did a BASE jump from the Eiger, from the Monk and from the Jungfrau,
p69
aVthree very famous mountains in Switzerland.
p70
aVThe special thing on these three jumps were,
p71
aVI hiked them all and climbed them all in only one day.
p72
aVIn 2008 I jumped the Eiffel Tower in Paris.
p73
aV(Laughter)
p74
aa(lp75
VSo with all this knowledge, I also
p76
aVwanted to get into stunts.
p77
aVSo with some friends we started to do different tricks,
p78
aVlike for example this jump here,
p79
aVI jumped from a paraglider.
p80
aVOr here \u2014 everybody was freezing, pretty much, except me,
p81
aVbecause it was very cold in Austria
p82
aVwhere we did this filming.
p83
aVEverybody sitting in a basket,
p84
aVand I was on top of the balloon,
p85
aVready to slide down with my skysurf board.
p86
aVOr this jump, from a moving truck on the highway.
p87
aV(Laughter)
p88
aa(lp89
VExtreme sports on top level like this
p90
aVis only possible if you practice step by step,
p91
aVif you really work hard on your skills
p92
aVand on your knowledge.
p93
aVOf course you need to be in physical, very good, condition,
p94
aVso I'm training a lot.
p95
aVYou need to have the best possible equipment.
p96
aVAnd probably the most important is
p97
aVyou have to work on your mental skills, mental preparation.
p98
aVAnd all this to come as close as possible
p99
aVto the human dream of being able to fly.
p100
aa(lp101
VSo for 2009,
p102
aVI'm training hard for my two new projects.
p103
aVThe first one, I want to set a world record
p104
aVin flying from a cliff with my wingsuit.
p105
aVAnd I want to set a new record,
p106
aVwith the longest distance ever flown.
p107
aVFor my second project,
p108
aVI have a sensational idea
p109
aVof a jump that never has been done before.
p110
aa(lp111
VSo now, on the following movie you will see
p112
aVthat I'm much better in flying a wingsuit
p113
aVthan speaking in English.
p114
aVEnjoy, and thank you very much.
p115
aV(Applause)
p116
aa(lp117
V(Applause)
p118
aa(lp119
VJune Cohen: I have some questions.
p120
aVI think we all might have some questions.
p121
aVQuestion one: so does that actually feel
p122
aVthe way the flying dream does?
p123
aVBecause it looks like it might.
p124
aa(lp125
VUeli Gegenschatz: Pretty much. I believe this is probably the closest
p126
aVpossibility to come to the dream of being able to fly.
p127
aa(lp128
VJC: I know the answer to this, but how do you land?
p129
aa(lp130
VUE: Parachute. We have to open a parachute
p131
aVjust seconds before, I would say, impact.
p132
aV(Laughter)
p133
aVIt's not possible to land a wingsuit yet.
p134
aa(lp135
VJC: Yet. But people are trying. Are you among those \u2014
p136
aVyou're not going to commit \u2014 are you among those trying to do it?
p137
aa(lp138
VUE: It's a dream. It's a dream. Yeah.
p139
aVWe're still working on it and we're
p140
aVdeveloping the wingsuits to get better performance,
p141
aVto get more knowledge.
p142
aVAnd I believe soon.
p143
aa(lp144
VJC: All right. Well we will watch this space. But I have two more questions.
p145
aVWhat is the \u2014 there was exhaust coming
p146
aVout of the back of the wingsuit. Was that a propelled wingsuit that you were wearing?
p147
aa(lp148
VUE: Nope. It's just smoke.
p149
aa(lp150
VJC: Coming off of you?
p151
aa(lp152
V(Laughter)
p153
aa(lp154
VUE: Hopefully not.
p155
aa(lp156
V(Laughter)
p157
aa(lp158
VJC: That seems dangerous.
p159
aa(lp160
VUE: No, smoke is for two reasons,
p161
aVyou can see the speed, you can see the way
p162
aVwhere I was flying.
p163
aVThat's reason number one. And reason number two:
p164
aVit's much easier for the camera guy to film
p165
aVIf I'm using smoke.
p166
aa(lp167
VJC: Ah, I see. So the wingsuit is set up to deliberately release smoke
p168
aVso that you can be tracked. One more question.
p169
aVWhat do you do to to cover your face?
p170
aVBecause I just keep thinking of going that fast
p171
aVand having your whole face smushed backwards.
p172
aVAre you in a helmet? Are you in goggles?
p173
aa(lp174
VUE: The purest and the best feeling would be with only goggles.
p175
aa(lp176
VJC: And is that how you usually fly?
p177
aa(lp178
VUE: Usually I'm wearing a helmet. In the mountains I'm always wearing a helmet
p179
aVbecause of landings \u2014 usually it's difficult \u2014
p180
aVit's not like regular skydiving where you have like the big landings.
p181
aVSo you have to be prepared.
p182
aa(lp183
VJC: Right. Now is there anything you don't do?
p184
aVDo people come to you with projects and say, "We want you to do this!"
p185
aVand do you ever say, "No, no I'm not going to."
p186
aa(lp187
VUE: Oh of course, of course. Some people have crazy ideas and \u2014
p188
aa(lp189
V(Laughter)
p190
aa(lp191
VJC: ...a round of applause...
p192
aa(lp193
V(Applause)
p194
aa(lp195
VUE: Thank you very much.
