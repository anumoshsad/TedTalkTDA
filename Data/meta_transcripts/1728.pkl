VI have spent my entire life
p4
aVeither at the schoolhouse, on the way to the schoolhouse,
p5
aVor talking about what happens in the schoolhouse.
p6
aa(lp7
V(Laughter)
p8
aa(lp9
VBoth my parents were educators,
p10
aVmy maternal grandparents were educators,
p11
aVand for the past 40 years, I've done the same thing.
p12
aVAnd so, needless to say, over those years
p13
aVI've had a chance to look at education reform
p14
aVfrom a lot of perspectives.
p15
aVSome of those reforms have been good.
p16
aVSome of them have been not so good.
p17
aVAnd we know why kids drop out.
p18
aVWe know why kids don't learn.
p19
aVIt's either poverty, low attendance,
p20
aVnegative peer influences...
p21
aVWe know why.
p22
aVBut one of the things that we never discuss
p23
aVor we rarely discuss
p24
aVis the value and importance of human connection.
p25
aVRelationships.
p26
aa(lp27
VJames Comer says that no significant learning
p28
aVcan occur without a significant relationship.
p29
aVGeorge Washington Carver says all learning
p30
aVis understanding relationships.
p31
aVEveryone in this room has been affected by a teacher or an adult.
p32
aVFor years, I have watched people teach.
p33
aVI have looked at the best and I've looked at some of the worst.
p34
aa(lp35
VA colleague said to me one time,
p36
aV"They don't pay me to like the kids.
p37
aVThey pay me to teach a lesson.
p38
aVThe kids should learn it.
p39
aVI should teach it, they should learn it,
p40
aVCase closed."
p41
aa(lp42
VWell, I said to her,
p43
aV"You know, kids don't learn from people they don't like."
p44
aa(lp45
V(Laughter)
p46
aa(lp47
V(Applause)
p48
aa(lp49
VShe said, "That's just a bunch of hooey."
p50
aa(lp51
VAnd I said to her,
p52
aa(lp53
V"Well, your year is going to be long and arduous, dear."
p54
aa(lp55
VNeedless to say, it was.
p56
aVSome people think that you can either have it in you to build a relationship,
p57
aVor you don't.
p58
aVI think Stephen Covey had the right idea.
p59
aVHe said you ought to just throw in a few simple things,
p60
aVlike seeking first to understand,
p61
aVas opposed to being understood.
p62
aVSimple things, like apologizing.
p63
aVYou ever thought about that?
p64
aVTell a kid you're sorry, they're in shock.
p65
aa(lp66
V(Laughter)
p67
aa(lp68
VI taught a lesson once on ratios.
p69
aVI'm not real good with math, but I was working on it.
p70
aa(lp71
V(Laughter)
p72
aa(lp73
VAnd I got back and looked at that teacher edition.
p74
aVI'd taught the whole lesson wrong.
p75
aa(lp76
V(Laughter)
p77
aa(lp78
VSo I came back to class the next day and I said,
p79
aV"Look, guys, I need to apologize.
p80
aVI taught the whole lesson wrong. I'm so sorry."
p81
aa(lp82
VThey said, "That's okay, Ms. Pierson.
p83
aVYou were so excited, we just let you go."
p84
aa(lp85
VI have had classes that were so low,
p86
aVso academically deficient, that I cried.
p87
aVI wondered, "How am I going to take this group,
p88
aVin nine months,
p89
aVfrom where they are to where they need to be?
p90
aVAnd it was difficult, it was awfully hard.
p91
aVHow do I raise the self-esteem of a child
p92
aVand his academic achievement at the same time?
p93
aa(lp94
VOne year I came up with a bright idea.
p95
aVI told all my students,
p96
aV"You were chosen to be in my class
p97
aVbecause I am the best teacher
p98
aVand you are the best students,
p99
aVthey put us all together
p100
aVso we could show everybody else how to do it."
p101
aa(lp102
VOne of the students said, "Really?"
p103
aa(lp104
V(Laughter)
p105
aa(lp106
VI said, "Really. We have to show the other classes
p107
aVhow to do it, so when we walk down the hall,
p108
aVpeople will notice us, so you can't make noise.
p109
aVYou just have to strut."
p110
aa(lp111
V(Laughter)
p112
aa(lp113
VAnd I gave them a saying to say:
p114
aV"I am somebody.
p115
aVI was somebody when I came.
p116
aVI'll be a better somebody when I leave.
p117
aVI am powerful, and I am strong.
p118
aVI deserve the education that I get here.
p119
aVI have things to do, people to impress,
p120
aVand places to go."
p121
aa(lp122
VAnd they said, "Yeah!"
p123
aa(lp124
V(Laughter)
p125
aa(lp126
VYou say it long enough,
p127
aVit starts to be a part of you.
p128
aa(lp129
V(Applause)
p130
aa(lp131
VI gave a quiz, 20 questions.
p132
aVA student missed 18.
p133
aVI put a "+2" on his paper and a big smiley face.
p134
aa(lp135
V(Laughter)
p136
aa(lp137
VHe said, "Ms. Pierson, is this an F?"
p138
aa(lp139
VI said, "Yes."
p140
aa(lp141
V(Laughter)
p142
aa(lp143
VHe said, "Then why'd you put a smiley face?"
p144
aa(lp145
VI said, "Because you're on a roll.
p146
aVYou got two right. You didn't miss them all."
p147
aa(lp148
V(Laughter)
p149
aa(lp150
VI said, "And when we review this, won't you do better?"
p151
aa(lp152
VHe said, "Yes, ma'am, I can do better."
p153
aa(lp154
VYou see, "-18" sucks all the life out of you.
p155
aV"+2" said, "I ain't all bad."
p156
aa(lp157
VFor years, I watched my mother take the time at recess to review,
p158
aVgo on home visits in the afternoon,
p159
aVbuy combs and brushes and peanut butter and crackers
p160
aVto put in her desk drawer for kids that needed to eat,
p161
aVand a washcloth and some soap for the kids who didn't smell so good.
p162
aVSee, it's hard to teach kids who stink.
p163
aa(lp164
V(Laughter)
p165
aa(lp166
VAnd kids can be cruel.
p167
aVAnd so she kept those things in her desk,
p168
aVand years later, after she retired,
p169
aVI watched some of those same kids come through
p170
aVand say to her, "You know, Ms. Walker,
p171
aVyou made a difference in my life.
p172
aVYou made it work for me.
p173
aVYou made me feel like I was somebody,
p174
aVwhen I knew, at the bottom, I wasn't.
p175
aVAnd I want you to just see what I've become."
p176
aa(lp177
VAnd when my mama died two years ago at 92,
p178
aVthere were so many former students at her funeral,
p179
aVit brought tears to my eyes, not because she was gone,
p180
aVbut because she left a legacy of relationships
p181
aVthat could never disappear.
p182
aa(lp183
VCan we stand to have more relationships?
p184
aVAbsolutely.
p185
aVWill you like all your children? Of course not.
p186
aa(lp187
V(Laughter)
p188
aa(lp189
VAnd you know your toughest kids are never absent.
p190
aa(lp191
V(Laughter)
p192
aa(lp193
VNever.
p194
aVYou won't like them all,
p195
aVand the tough ones show up for a reason.
p196
aVIt's the connection. It's the relationships.
p197
aVSo teachers become great actors and great actresses,
p198
aVand we come to work when we don't feel like it,
p199
aVand we're listening to policy that doesn't make sense,
p200
aVand we teach anyway.
p201
aVWe teach anyway, because that's what we do.
p202
aa(lp203
VTeaching and learning should bring joy.
p204
aVHow powerful would our world be
p205
aVif we had kids who were not afraid to take risks,
p206
aVwho were not afraid to think,
p207
aVand who had a champion?
p208
aVEvery child deserves a champion,
p209
aVan adult who will never give up on them,
p210
aVwho understands the power of connection,
p211
aVand insists that they become the best that they can possibly be.
p212
aa(lp213
VIs this job tough? You betcha.
p214
aVOh God, you betcha.
p215
aVBut it is not impossible.
p216
aVWe can do this. We're educators.
p217
aVWe're born to make a difference.
p218
aa(lp219
VThank you so much.
