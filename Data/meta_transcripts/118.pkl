VSergey Brin: I want to discuss a question
p4
aVI know that's been pressing on many of your minds.
p5
aVWe spoke to you last several years ago.
p6
aVAnd before I get started today,
p7
aVsince many of you are wondering,
p8
aVI just wanted to get it out of the way.
p9
aVThe answer is boxers.
p10
aVNow I hope all of you feel better.
p11
aa(lp12
VDo you know what this might be? Does anyone know what that is?
p13
aa(lp14
VAudience: Yes.
p15
aa(lp16
VSB: What is it?
p17
aa(lp18
VAudience: It's people logging on to Google around the world.
p19
aa(lp20
VSB: Wow, OK. I didn't really realize what it was when I first saw it.
p21
aVBut this is what helped me see it.
p22
aVThis is what we run at the office, that actually runs real time.
p23
aVHere it's slightly logged.
p24
aVBut here you can see around the world
p25
aVhow people are using Google.
p26
aVAnd every one of those rising dots
p27
aVrepresents probably about 20, 30 searches,
p28
aVor something like that.
p29
aVAnd they're labeled by color right now, by language.
p30
aa(lp31
VSo you can see: here we are in the U.S.,
p32
aVand they're all coming up red.
p33
aVThere we are in Monterey \u2014 hopefully I can get it right.
p34
aVYou can see that Japan is busy at night,
p35
aVright there.
p36
aVWe have Tokyo coming in in Japanese.
p37
aVThere's a lot of activity in China.
p38
aVThere's a lot of activity in India.
p39
aVThere's some in the Middle East, the little pockets.
p40
aVAnd Europe, which is right now in the middle of the day,
p41
aVis going really strong with a whole wide variety of languages.
p42
aa(lp43
VNow you can also see, if I turn this around here \u2014
p44
aVhopefully I won't shake the world too much.
p45
aVBut you can also see, there are places where there's not so much.
p46
aVAustralia, because there just aren't very many people there.
p47
aVAnd this is something that we should really work on,
p48
aVwhich is Africa, which is just a few trickles,
p49
aVbasically in South Africa and a few other urban cities.
p50
aVBut basically, what we've noticed is these queries,
p51
aVwhich come in at thousands per second,
p52
aVare available everywhere there is power.
p53
aVAnd pretty much everywhere there is power, there is the Internet.
p54
aVAnd even in Antarctica \u2014 well, at least this time of year \u2014
p55
aVwe from time to time will see a query rising up.
p56
aVAnd if we had it plotted correctly,
p57
aVI think the International Space Station would have it, too.
p58
aa(lp59
VSo this is
p60
aVsome of the challenge that we have here,
p61
aVis you can see that it's actually kind of hard to get the \u2014
p62
aVthere we go.
p63
aVThis is how we have to move the bits around
p64
aVto actually get the people the answers to their questions.
p65
aVYou can see that there's a lot of data running around.
p66
aVIt has to go all over the world: through fibers,
p67
aVthrough satellites, through all kinds of connections.
p68
aVAnd it's pretty tricky for us to maintain the latencies
p69
aVas low as we try to. Hopefully your experience is good.
p70
aVBut you can see also, once again \u2014 so some places are much more wired
p71
aVthan others, and you can see all the bandwidth across the U.S.,
p72
aVgoing up over to Asia, Europe in the other direction, and so forth.
p73
aa(lp74
VNow what I would like to do is just to show you
p75
aVwhat one second of this activity would look like.
p76
aVAnd if we can switch to slides \u2014
p77
aVall right, here we go.
p78
aVSo this is slowed down.
p79
aVThis is what one second looks like.
p80
aVAnd this is what we spend a lot of our time doing,
p81
aVis just making sure that we can keep up
p82
aVwith this kind of traffic load.
p83
aVNow, each one of those queries
p84
aVhas an interesting life and tale of its own.
p85
aVI mean, it could be somebody's health,
p86
aVit could be somebody's career, something important to them.
p87
aVAnd it could potentially be something
p88
aVas important as tomato sauce,
p89
aVor in this case, ketchup.
p90
aa(lp91
VSo this is a query that we had \u2014
p92
aVI guess it's a popular band that was more popular in some parts of the world than others.
p93
aVYou can see that it got started right here.
p94
aVIn the U.S. and Spain, it was popular at the same time.
p95
aVBut it didn't have quite the same pickup in the U.S.
p96
aVas it did in Spain.
p97
aVAnd then from Spain, it went to Italy,
p98
aVand then Germany got excited, and maybe right now the U.K. is enjoying it.
p99
aVAnd so I guess the U.S. finally,
p100
aVfinally started to like it, too.
p101
aVAnd I just wanted to play it for you.
p102
aa(lp103
VAnyway, you can all enjoy it for yourselves \u2014
p104
aVhopefully that search will work.
p105
aVAs a part of \u2014
p106
aVyou know, part of what we want to do to grow our company
p107
aVis to have more searches.
p108
aVAnd what that means is we want to have
p109
aVmore people who are healthy and educated.
p110
aVMore animals, if they start doing searches as well.
p111
aVBut partly, we want to make the world a better place,
p112
aVand so one thing that we're embarking upon is the Google Foundation,
p113
aVand we're in the process of setting that up.
p114
aa(lp115
VWe also have a program already called Google Grants
p116
aVthat now serves over 150 different charities around the world,
p117
aVand these are some of the charities that are on there.
p118
aVAnd it's something I'm very excited to be a part of.
p119
aVIn fact, many of the organizations that are here \u2014
p120
aVthe Acumen Fund, I think ApproTEC we have running, I'm not sure if that one's up yet \u2014
p121
aVand many of the people who have presented here are running through Google Grants.
p122
aVThey run Google ads, and we just give them the ad credit
p123
aVso they can let organizations know.
p124
aa(lp125
VOne of the earlier results that we got \u2014
p126
aVwe have a Singaporean businessman who is now sponsoring a village
p127
aVof 25 Vietnamese girls for their education,
p128
aVand that was one of the earliest results. And as I said, now there have been
p129
aVmany, many stories that have come in,
p130
aVbecause we do have hundreds of charities in there,
p131
aVand the Google Foundation will be an even broader endeavor.
p132
aVNow does anybody know who this is?
p133
aVA-ha!
p134
aa(lp135
VAudience: Orkut.
p136
aa(lp137
VSB: Yes! Somebody got it.
p138
aVThis is Orkut. Is anybody here on Orkut?
p139
aVDo we have any?
p140
aVOkay, not very many people know about it.
p141
aVI'll explain it in a second.
p142
aVThis is one of our engineers.
p143
aVWe find that they work better when they're submerged and covered with leaves.
p144
aVThat's how we churn those products out.
p145
aVOrkut had a vision to create a social network.
p146
aVI know all of you are thinking, "Yet another social network."
p147
aVBut it was a dream of his, and we, basically,
p148
aVwhen people really want to do something, well, we generally let them.
p149
aVSo this is what he built.
p150
aVWe just released it in a test phase last month,
p151
aVand it's been taking off.
p152
aa(lp153
VThis is our VP of Engineering.
p154
aVYou can see the red hair, and I don't know if you can see the nose ring there.
p155
aVAnd these are all of his friends.
p156
aVSo this is how \u2014 we just deployed it \u2014
p157
aVwe just decided that people would send each other invitations to get into the service,
p158
aVand so we just had the people in our company initially send them out.
p159
aVAnd now we've grown to over 100,000 members.
p160
aVAnd they spread, actually, very quickly, even outside the U.S.
p161
aa(lp162
VYou can see, even though the U.S. is still the majority here \u2014
p163
aVthough, by the way, search-wise, it's only about 30 percent of our traffic \u2014
p164
aVbut it's already going to Japan, and the U.K., and Europe,
p165
aVand all the rest of the countries.
p166
aVSo it's a fun little project.
p167
aVThere are a variety of demographics. I won't bore you with these.
p168
aVBut it's just the kind of thing that we just try out for fun
p169
aVand see where it goes.
p170
aVAnd \u2014
p171
aVwell, I'll leave you in suspense.
p172
aVLarry, you can explain this one.
p173
aa(lp174
VLarry Page: Thank you, Sergey.
p175
aVSo one of the things \u2014 both Sergey and I
p176
aVwent to a Montessori school,
p177
aVand I think, for some reason,
p178
aVthis has been incorporated in Google.
p179
aVAnd Sergey mentioned Orkut, which is something that,
p180
aVyou know, Orkut wanted to do in his time,
p181
aVand we call this \u2014 at Google, we've embodied this as "the 20 percent time,"
p182
aVand the idea is, for 20 percent of your time,
p183
aVif you're working at Google, you can do what you think is the best thing to do.
p184
aVAnd many, many things at Google have come out of that,
p185
aVsuch as Orkut and also Google News.
p186
aVAnd I think many other things in the world also have come out of this.
p187
aVMendel, who was supposed to be teaching high-school students,
p188
aVactually, you know, discovered the laws of genetics \u2014
p189
aVas a hobby, basically.
p190
aVSo many, many useful things come out of this.
p191
aa(lp192
VAnd News, which I just mentioned,
p193
aVwas started by a researcher.
p194
aVAnd he just \u2014 he \u2014 after 9/11, he got really interested in the news.
p195
aVAnd he said, "Why don't I look at the news better?"
p196
aVAnd so he started clustering it by category,
p197
aVand then he started using it, and then his friends started using it.
p198
aVAnd then, besides just looking cute on a baby's bottom,
p199
aVwe made it a Googlette,
p200
aVwhich is basically a small project at Google.
p201
aa(lp202
VSo it'd be like three people, or something like that,
p203
aVand they would try to make a product.
p204
aVAnd we wouldn't really be sure if it's going to work or not.
p205
aVAnd in News' case, you know, they had a couple of people
p206
aVworking on it for a while, and then more and more people
p207
aVstarted using it, and then we put it out on the Internet,
p208
aVand more and more people started using it.
p209
aVAnd now it's a real, full-blown project with more people on it.
p210
aVAnd this is how we keep our innovation running.
p211
aa(lp212
VI think usually, as companies get bigger,
p213
aVthey find it really hard to have small, innovative projects.
p214
aVAnd we had this problem, too, for a while, and we said,
p215
aV"Oh, we really need a new concept."
p216
aVYou know, the Googlettes \u2014 that's a small project that we're not quite sure if it's going to work or not,
p217
aVbut we hope it will, and if we do enough of them,
p218
aVsome of them will really work and turn out, such as News.
p219
aa(lp220
VBut then we had a problem because then we had over 100 projects.
p221
aVAnd I don't know about all of you,
p222
aVbut I have trouble keeping 100 things in my head at once.
p223
aVAnd we found that if we just wrote all of them down
p224
aVand ordered them \u2014 and these are kind of made up.
p225
aVDon't really pay attention to them.
p226
aVFor example, the "Buy Iceland" was from a media article.
p227
aVWe would never do such a crazy thing, but \u2014
p228
aVin any case, we found if we just basically wrote them all down and ordered them,
p229
aVthat most people would actually agree what the ordering should be.
p230
aVAnd this was kind of a surprise to me, but
p231
aVwe found that as long as you keep the 100 things in your head,
p232
aVwhich you did by writing them down,
p233
aVthat you could do a pretty good job deciding what to do
p234
aVand where to put your resources.
p235
aVAnd so that's basically what we've done
p236
aVsince we instituted that a few years ago, and I think it has really allowed us to be innovative
p237
aVand still stay reasonably well-organized.
p238
aa(lp239
VThe other thing we discovered is that people like to work on things that are important,
p240
aVand so naturally,
p241
aVpeople sort of migrate to the things that are high priorities.
p242
aVI just wanted to highlight a couple of things
p243
aVthat are new, or you might not know about.
p244
aVAnd the top thing, actually, is the Deskbar.
p245
aVSo this is a new \u2014 how many of you use the Google Toolbar?
p246
aVRaise your hands.
p247
aa(lp248
VHow many of you use the Deskbar?
p249
aVAll right, see? You guys should try it out.
p250
aVBut if you go to our site and search
p251
aVfor "Deskbar," you'll get this.
p252
aVAnd the idea is, instead of a toolbar, it's just present all the time
p253
aVon your screen on the bottom,
p254
aVand you can do searches really easily.
p255
aVAnd it's sort of like a better version of the toolbar.
p256
aVThank you, Sergey.
p257
aa(lp258
VThis is another example of a project that somebody at Google
p259
aVwas really passionate about, and they just, they got going,
p260
aVand it's really, really a great product, and really taking off.
p261
aVGoogle Answers is something we started, which is really cool,
p262
aVwhich lets you \u2014 for five to 100 dollars,
p263
aVyou can type a question in,
p264
aVand then there's a pool of researchers
p265
aVthat go out and research it for you, and it's guaranteed and all that,
p266
aVand you can get actually very good answers to things
p267
aVwithout spending all that time yourself.
p268
aa(lp269
VFroogle lets you search shopping information,
p270
aVand Blogger lets you publish things.
p271
aVBut all of these \u2014 well, these were all sort of innovative things that we did that \u2014
p272
aVyou know, we try many, many different things
p273
aVin our company.
p274
aVWe also like to innovate in our physical space,
p275
aVand we noticed in meetings, you know, you have to wait a long time
p276
aVfor projectors to turn on and off,
p277
aVand they're noisy, so people shut them off.
p278
aVAnd we didn't like that, so we actually,
p279
aVin maybe a couple of weeks, we built these little enclosures
p280
aVthat enclosed the projectors, and so we can leave them on all the time
p281
aVand they're completely silent.
p282
aVAnd as a result, we were able to build some software
p283
aVthat also lets us manage a meeting,
p284
aVso when you walk into a meeting room now,
p285
aVit lists all the meetings that are happening,
p286
aVyou can very easily take notes, and they just get emailed automatically
p287
aVto all the people that were present in the meeting.
p288
aa(lp289
VAnd as we become more of a global company,
p290
aVwe find these things really affect us \u2014
p291
aVyou know, can we work effectively with people who aren't in the room?
p292
aVAnd things like that. And simple things like this can really make a big difference.
p293
aVWe also have a lot of engineers in those meetings,
p294
aVand they don't always do their laundry as much as they should.
p295
aVAnd so we found it was pretty helpful
p296
aVto have laundry machines, for our younger employees especially, and ...
p297
aVwe also allow dogs and things like that,
p298
aVand we've had, I think, a really fun culture at our company,
p299
aVwhich helps people work and enjoy what they're doing.
p300
aa(lp301
VThis is actually our "cult picture."
p302
aVI just wanted to show quickly.
p303
aVWe had this on our website for a while,
p304
aVbut we found that after we put it on our website,
p305
aVwe didn't get any job applications anymore.
p306
aVBut anyway, every year we've taken
p307
aVthe whole company on a ski trip.
p308
aVA lot of work happens in companies from people knowing each other, and informally.
p309
aVAnd I think we've done a good job encouraging that.
p310
aVIt makes it a really fun place to work.
p311
aa(lp312
VAlong with our logos, too, which I think really embody
p313
aVour culture when we change things.
p314
aVIn the early days, we were actually advised
p315
aVwe should never change our logo because
p316
aVwe should establish our brand, you know,
p317
aVbecause, you know, you'd never want to change your logo.
p318
aVYou want it to be consistent.
p319
aVAnd we said, "Well, that doesn't sound so much fun.
p320
aVWhy don't we try changing it every day?"
p321
aa(lp322
VOne of the things that really excites me about what we're doing now
p323
aVis we have this thing called AdSense,
p324
aVand this is a little bit foreshadowing \u2014
p325
aVthis is from before Dean dropped out.
p326
aVBut the idea is, like, on a newspaper, for example,
p327
aVwe show you relevant ads.
p328
aVAnd this is hard to read, but this says "Battle for New Hampshire:
p329
aVHoward Dean for President" \u2014 articles on Howard Dean.
p330
aVAnd these ads are generated automatically \u2014
p331
aVlike in this case, on the Washington Post \u2014
p332
aVfrom the content on the site.
p333
aVAnd so we use our over 150,000 advertisers
p334
aVand millions of advertisements, so we pick the one
p335
aVthat's most relevant to what you're actually looking at,
p336
aVmuch as we do on search.
p337
aVSo the idea is we can make advertising useful,
p338
aVnot just annoying, right?
p339
aa(lp340
VAnd the nice thing about this,
p341
aVwe have a self-serve program,
p342
aVand many thousands of websites have signed up,
p343
aVand this let's them really make money. And I \u2014
p344
aVyou know, there's a number of people I met \u2014
p345
aVI met this guy who runs a conservation site at a party,
p346
aVand he said, "You know, I wasn't making any money.
p347
aVI just put this thing on my site and I'm making 10,000 dollars a month.
p348
aVAnd, you know, thank you.
p349
aVI don't have to do my other job now."
p350
aVAnd I think this is really important for us, because it makes the Internet work better.
p351
aVIt makes content get better, it makes searching work better,
p352
aVwhen people can really make their livelihood
p353
aVfrom producing great content.
p354
aa(lp355
VSo this session is supposed to be about the future,
p356
aVso I'd thought I'd talk at least briefly about it.
p357
aVAnd the idea behind this is to do the perfect job doing search,
p358
aVyou really have to be smart.
p359
aVBecause you can type, you know, any kind of thing into Google,
p360
aVand you expect an answer back, right?
p361
aVBut finding things is tricky, and so you really want intelligence.
p362
aVAnd in fact, the ultimate search engine would be smart.
p363
aVIt would be artificial intelligence.
p364
aVAnd so that's something we work on,
p365
aVand we even have some people who are excited enough
p366
aVand crazy enough to work on it now,
p367
aVand that's really their goal.
p368
aVSo we always hope that Google will be smart,
p369
aVbut we're always surprised when other people think that it is.
p370
aa(lp371
VAnd so I just wanted to give a funny example of this.
p372
aVThis is a blog from Iraq,
p373
aVand it's not really what
p374
aVI'm going to talk about, but I just wanted to show you an example.
p375
aVMaybe, Sergey, you can highlight this.
p376
aVSo we decided \u2014
p377
aVactually, the highlight's right there. Oh, thank you.
p378
aa(lp379
VSo, "related searches," right there. You can't see it that well,
p380
aVbut we decided we should put in this feature
p381
aVinto our AdSense ads, called "related searches."
p382
aVAnd so we'd say, you know, "Did you mean 'search for'" \u2014 what is this,
p383
aVin this case, "Saddam Hussein," because this blog is about Iraq \u2014
p384
aVand you know, in addition to the ads,
p385
aVand we thought this would be a great idea.
p386
aa(lp387
VAnd so there is this blog
p388
aVof a young person who was kind of depressed, and he said,
p389
aV"You know, I'm sleeping a lot."
p390
aVHe was just kind of writing about his life.
p391
aVAnd our algorithms \u2014 not a person, of course,
p392
aVbut our algorithms, our computers \u2014
p393
aVread his blog and decided that
p394
aVthe related search was, "I am bored."
p395
aVAnd he read this, and he thought a person had decided
p396
aVthat he was boring,
p397
aVand it was very unfortunate,
p398
aVand he said, "You know, what are these, you know, bastards at Google doing?
p399
aVWhy don't they like my blog?"
p400
aVAnd so then we read his blog, which was getting \u2014 you know,
p401
aVsort of going from bad to worse,
p402
aVand we said the related search was, "Retards."
p403
aVAnd then, you know, he got even more mad,
p404
aVand he wrote \u2014 like, started swearing and so on.
p405
aVAnd then we produced "You suck."
p406
aVAnd finally, it ended with "Kiss my ass."
p407
aVAnd so basically, he thought he was dealing with something smart,
p408
aVand of course, you know,

aVwe just sort of wrote this program and we tried it out,
p410
aVand it didn't quite work,
p411
aVand we don't have this feature anymore.

VSo with that, maybe I can switch back to the world.
p414
aVI wanted to end just by saying that
p415
aVthere's a couple things that really make me excited
p416
aVto be involved with Google,
p417
aVand one of those is that we're able to make money
p418
aVlargely through advertising, and one of the benefits that I didn't expect from that
p419
aVwas that we're able to serve everyone in the world
p420
aVwithout worrying about, you know, places that don't have as much money.
p421
aVSo we don't have to worry about our products being sold,
p422
aVfor example, for less money in places that are poor,
p423
aVand then they get re-imported into the U.S. \u2014
p424
aVfor example, with the drug industry.
p425
aa(lp426
VAnd I think we're really lucky to have that kind of business model
p427
aVbecause everyone in the world has access to our search,
p428
aVand I think that's a tremendous, tremendous benefit.
p429
aVThe other thing I wanted to mention just briefly
p430
aVis that we have a tremendous ability and responsibility
p431
aVto provide people the right information,
p432
aVand we view ourselves like a newspaper or a magazine \u2014
p433
aVthat we should provide very objective information.
p434
aa(lp435
VAnd so in our search results, we never accept payment for our search results.
p436
aVWe accept payment for advertising,
p437
aVand we mark it as such.
p438
aVAnd that's unlike many of our competitors.
p439
aVAnd I think decisions we're able to make like that
p440
aVhave a tremendous impact on the world,
p441
aVand it makes me really proud to be involved with Google.
p442
aVSo thank you.
