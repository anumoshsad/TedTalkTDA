VLet's just start by looking at some great photographs.
p4
aVThis is an icon of National Geographic,
p5
aVan Afghan refugee taken by Steve McCurry.
p6
aVBut the Harvard Lampoon is about to come out
p7
aVwith a parody of National Geographic,
p8
aVand I shudder to think what they're going to do to this photograph.
p9
aVOh, the wrath of Photoshop.
p10
aa(lp11
VThis is a jet landing at San Francisco, by Bruce Dale.
p12
aVHe mounted a camera on the tail.
p13
aVA poetic image for a story on Tolstoy, by Sam Abell.
p14
aVPygmies in the DRC, by Randy Olson.
p15
aVI love this photograph because it reminds me
p16
aVof Degas' bronze sculptures of the little dancer.
p17
aVA polar bear swimming in the Arctic, by Paul Nicklen.
p18
aVPolar bears need ice to be able to move back and forth \u2014
p19
aVthey're not very good swimmers \u2014
p20
aVand we know what's happening to the ice.
p21
aVThese are camels moving across the Rift Valley in Africa,
p22
aVphotographed by Chris Johns.
p23
aVShot straight down, so these are the shadows of the camels.
p24
aVThis is a rancher in Texas, by William Albert Allard,
p25
aVa great portraitist.
p26
aVAnd Jane Goodall, making her own special connection,
p27
aVphotographed by Nick Nichols.
p28
aVThis is a soap disco in Spain, photographed by David Alan Harvey.
p29
aVAnd David said that there was lot of weird stuff
p30
aVhappening on the dance floor.
p31
aVBut, hey, at least it's hygienic.
p32
aV(Laughter)
p33
aVThese are sea lions in Australia doing their own dance,
p34
aVby David Doubilet.
p35
aVAnd this is a comet, captured by Dr. Euan Mason.
p36
aVAnd finally, the bow of the Titanic, without movie stars,
p37
aVphotographed by Emory Kristof.
p38
aVPhotography carries a power that holds up
p39
aVunder the relentless swirl of today's saturated, media world,
p40
aVbecause photographs emulate the way
p41
aVthat our mind freezes a significant moment.
p42
aa(lp43
VHere's an example.
p44
aVFour years ago, I was at the beach with my son,
p45
aVand he was learning how to swim
p46
aVin this relatively soft surf of the Delaware beaches.
p47
aVBut I turned away for a moment, and he got caught into a riptide
p48
aVand started to be pulled out towards the jetty.
p49
aVI can stand here right now and see,
p50
aVas I go tearing into the water after him,
p51
aVthe moments slowing down and freezing into this arrangement.
p52
aVI can see the rocks are over here.
p53
aVThere's a wave about to crash onto him.
p54
aVI can see his hands reaching out,
p55
aVand I can see his face in terror,
p56
aVlooking at me, saying, "Help me, Dad."
p57
aVI got him. The wave broke over us.
p58
aVWe got back on shore; he was fine.
p59
aVWe were a little bit rattled.
p60
aVBut this flashbulb memory, as it's called,
p61
aVis when all the elements came together to define
p62
aVnot just the event, but my emotional connection to it.
p63
aVAnd this is what a photograph taps into
p64
aVwhen it makes its own powerful connection to a viewer.
p65
aa(lp66
VNow I have to tell you,
p67
aVI was talking to Kyle last week about this,
p68
aVthat I was going to tell this story.
p69
aVAnd he said, "Oh, yeah, I remember that too!
p70
aVI remember my image of you
p71
aVwas that you were up on the shore yelling at me."
p72
aV(Laughter)
p73
aVI thought I was a hero.
p74
aV(Laughter)
p75
aa(lp76
VSo,
p77
aVthis represents \u2014 this is a cross-sample of
p78
aVsome remarkable images taken by some of the world's greatest photojournalists,
p79
aVworking at the very top of their craft \u2014
p80
aVexcept one.
p81
aVThis photograph was taken by Dr. Euan Mason
p82
aVin New Zealand last year,
p83
aVand it was submitted and published in National Geographic.
p84
aVLast year, we added a section to our website called "Your Shot,"
p85
aVwhere anyone can submit photographs for possible publication.
p86
aVAnd it has become a wild success,
p87
aVtapping into the enthusiast photography community.
p88
aVThe quality of these amateur photographs
p89
aVcan, at times, be amazing.
p90
aVAnd seeing this reinforces, for me,
p91
aVthat every one of us has at least one or two
p92
aVgreat photographs in them.
p93
aa(lp94
VBut to be a great photojournalist,
p95
aVyou have to have more than just one or two
p96
aVgreat photographs in you.
p97
aVYou've got to be able to make them all the time.
p98
aVBut even more importantly,
p99
aVyou need to know how to create a visual narrative.
p100
aVYou need to know how to tell a story.
p101
aVSo I'm going to share with you some coverages
p102
aVthat I feel demonstrate the storytelling power of photography.
p103
aa(lp104
VPhotographer Nick Nichols went to document
p105
aVa very small and relatively unknown wildlife sanctuary
p106
aVin Chad, called Zakouma.
p107
aVThe original intent was to travel there
p108
aVand bring back a classic story of diverse species,
p109
aVof an exotic locale.
p110
aVAnd that is what Nick did, up to a point.
p111
aVThis is a serval cat.
p112
aVHe's actually taking his own picture,
p113
aVshot with what's called a camera trap.
p114
aVThere's an infrared beam that's going across,
p115
aVand he has stepped into the beam and taken his photograph.
p116
aVThese are baboons at a watering hole.
p117
aVNick \u2014 the camera, again, an automatic camera
p118
aVtook thousands of pictures of this.
p119
aVAnd Nick ended up with a lot of pictures
p120
aVof the rear ends of baboons.
p121
aV(Laughter)
p122
aVA lion having a late night snack \u2014
p123
aVnotice he's got a broken tooth.
p124
aVAnd a crocodile walks up a riverbank toward its den.
p125
aVI love this little bit of water
p126
aVthat comes off the back of his tail.
p127
aa(lp128
VBut the centerpiece species of Zakouma are the elephants.
p129
aVIt's one of the largest intact herds in this part of Africa.
p130
aVHere's a photograph shot in moonlight,
p131
aVsomething that digital photography has made a big difference for.
p132
aVIt was with the elephants that this story pivoted.
p133
aVNick, along with researcher Dr. Michael Fay,
p134
aVcollared the matriarch of the herd.
p135
aVThey named her Annie,
p136
aVand they began tracking her movements.
p137
aVThe herd was safe within the confines of the park,
p138
aVbecause of this dedicated group of park rangers.
p139
aVBut once the annual rains began,
p140
aVthe herd would begin migrating to feeding grounds outside the park.
p141
aa(lp142
VAnd that's when they ran into trouble.
p143
aVFor outside the safety of the park were poachers,
p144
aVwho would hunt them down only for the value of their ivory tusks.
p145
aVThe matriarch that they were radio tracking,
p146
aVafter weeks of moving back and forth, in and out of the park,
p147
aVcame to a halt outside the park.
p148
aVAnnie had been killed, along with 20 members of her herd.
p149
aVAnd they only came for the ivory.
p150
aVThis is actually one of the rangers.
p151
aVThey were able to chase off one of the poachers and recover this ivory,
p152
aVbecause they couldn't leave it there,
p153
aVbecause it's still valuable.
p154
aVBut what Nick did was he brought back
p155
aVa story that went beyond the old-school method
p156
aVof just straight, "Isn't this an amazing world?"
p157
aVAnd instead, created a story that touched our audiences deeply.
p158
aVInstead of just knowledge of this park,
p159
aVhe created an understanding and an empathy
p160
aVfor the elephants, the rangers and the many issues
p161
aVsurrounding human-wildlife conflicts.
p162
aa(lp163
VNow let's go over to India.
p164
aVSometimes you can tell a broad story in a focused way.
p165
aVWe were looking at the same issue that Richard Wurman
p166
aVtouches upon in his new world population project.
p167
aVFor the first time in history,
p168
aVmore people live in urban, rather than rural, environments.
p169
aVAnd most of that growth is not in the cities,
p170
aVbut in the slums that surround them.
p171
aVJonas Bendiksen, a very energetic photographer,
p172
aVcame to me and said,
p173
aV"We need to document this, and here's my proposal.
p174
aVLet's go all over the world and photograph every single slum around the world."
p175
aVAnd I said, "Well, you know, that might be a bit ambitious for our budget."
p176
aVSo instead, what we did was
p177
aVwe decided to, instead of going out and doing what would result
p178
aVin what we'd consider sort of a survey story \u2014
p179
aVwhere you just go in and see just a little bit of everything \u2014
p180
aVwe put Jonas into Dharavi,
p181
aVwhich is part of Mumbai, India,
p182
aVand let him stay there, and really get into
p183
aVthe heart and soul of this really major part of the city.
p184
aVWhat Jonas did was not just go and do a surface look
p185
aVat the awful conditions that exist in such places.
p186
aVHe saw that this was a living and breathing and vital part
p187
aVof how the entire urban area functioned.
p188
aVBy staying tightly focused in one place,
p189
aVJonas tapped into the soul and the enduring human spirit
p190
aVthat underlies this community.
p191
aVAnd he did it in a beautiful way.
p192
aa(lp193
VSometimes, though, the only way to tell a story is with a sweeping picture.
p194
aVWe teamed up underwater photographer Brian Skerry
p195
aVand photojournalist Randy Olson
p196
aVto document the depletion of the world's fisheries.
p197
aVWe weren't the only ones to tackle this subject,
p198
aVbut the photographs that Brian and Randy created
p199
aVare among the best to capture both the human
p200
aVand natural devastation of overfishing.
p201
aVHere, in a photo by Brian,
p202
aVa seemingly crucified shark is caught up
p203
aVin a gill net off of Baja.
p204
aVI've seen sort of OK pictures of bycatch,
p205
aVthe animals accidentally scooped up
p206
aVwhile fishing for a specific species.
p207
aVBut here, Brian captured a unique view
p208
aVby positioning himself underneath the boat
p209
aVwhen they threw the waste overboard.
p210
aVAnd Brian then went on to even greater risk
p211
aVto get this never-before-made photograph
p212
aVof a trawl net scraping the ocean bottom.
p213
aa(lp214
VBack on land, Randy Olson photographed
p215
aVa makeshift fish market in Africa,
p216
aVwhere the remains of filleted fish were sold to the locals,
p217
aVthe main parts having already been sent to Europe.
p218
aVAnd here in China, Randy shot a jellyfish market.
p219
aVAs prime food sources are depleted,
p220
aVthe harvest goes deeper into the oceans
p221
aVand brings in more such sources of protein.
p222
aVThis is called fishing down the food chain.
p223
aa(lp224
VBut there are also glimmers of hope,
p225
aVand I think anytime we're doing a big, big story on this,
p226
aVwe don't really want to go
p227
aVand just look at all the problems.
p228
aVWe also want to look for solutions.
p229
aVBrian photographed a marine sanctuary in New Zealand,
p230
aVwhere commercial fishing had been banned \u2014
p231
aVthe result being that the overfished species have been restored,
p232
aVand with them a possible solution for sustainable fisheries.
p233
aa(lp234
VPhotography can also compel us to confront
p235
aVissues that are potentially distressing and controversial.
p236
aVJames Nachtwey, who was honored at last year's TED,
p237
aVtook a look at the sweep of the medical system
p238
aVthat is utilized to handle the American wounded coming out of Iraq.
p239
aVIt is like a tube where a wounded soldier enters on one end
p240
aVand exits back home, on the other.
p241
aVJim started in the battlefield.
p242
aVHere, a medical technician tends to a wounded soldier
p243
aVon the helicopter ride back to the field hospital.
p244
aVHere is in the field hospital.
p245
aVThe soldier on the right has the name of his daughter
p246
aVtattooed across his chest, as a reminder of home.
p247
aVFrom here, the more severely wounded are transported
p248
aVback to Germany, where they meet up with their families
p249
aVfor the first time.
p250
aVAnd then back to the States to recuperate at veterans' hospitals,
p251
aVsuch as here in Walter Reed.
p252
aVAnd finally, often fitted with high-tech prosthesis,
p253
aVthey exit the medical system and attempt
p254
aVto regain their pre-war lives.
p255
aVJim took what could have been a straight-up medical science story
p256
aVand gave it a human dimension that touched our readers deeply.
p257
aa(lp258
VNow, these stories are great examples
p259
aVof how photography can be used
p260
aVto address some of our most important topics.
p261
aVBut there are also times when photographers
p262
aVsimply encounter things that are, when it comes down to it,
p263
aVjust plain fun.
p264
aVPhotographer Paul Nicklin traveled to Antarctica
p265
aVto shoot a story on leopard seals.
p266
aVThey have been rarely photographed, partly because they are considered
p267
aVone of the most dangerous predators in the ocean.
p268
aVIn fact, a year earlier, a researcher had been
p269
aVgrabbed by one and pulled down to depth and killed.
p270
aVSo you can imagine Paul was maybe a little bit hesitant
p271
aVabout getting into the water.
p272
aVNow, what leopard seals do mostly is, they eat penguins.
p273
aVYou know of "The March of the Penguins."
p274
aVThis is sort of the munch of the penguins.
p275
aV(Laughter)
p276
aVHere a penguin goes up to the edge and looks out
p277
aVto see if the coast is clear.
p278
aVAnd then everybody kind of runs out and goes out.
p279
aa(lp280
VBut then Paul got in the water.
p281
aVAnd he said he was never really afraid of this.
p282
aVWell, this one female came up to him.
p283
aVShe's probably \u2014 it's a shame you can't see it in the photograph,
p284
aVbut she's 12 feet long.
p285
aVSo, she is pretty significant in size.
p286
aVAnd Paul said he was never really afraid,
p287
aVbecause she was more curious about him than threatened.
p288
aVThis mouthing behavior, on the right,
p289
aVwas really her way of saying to him, "Hey, look how big I am!"
p290
aVOr you know, "My, what big teeth you have."
p291
aV(Laughter)
p292
aVThen Paul thinks that she simply took pity on him.
p293
aVTo her, here was this big, goofy creature in the water
p294
aVthat for some reason didn't seem to be interested
p295
aVin chasing penguins.
p296
aVSo what she did was she started to bring penguins to him,
p297
aValive, and put them in front of him.
p298
aVShe dropped them off, and then they would swim away.
p299
aVShe'd kind of look at him, like "What are you doing?"
p300
aVGo back and get them, and then bring them back
p301
aVand drop them in front of him.
p302
aVAnd she did this over the course of a couple of days,
p303
aVuntil the point where she got so frustrated with him
p304
aVthat she started putting them directly on top of his head.
p305
aV(Laughter)
p306
aVWhich just resulted in a fantastic photograph.
p307
aV(Laughter)
p308
aVEventually, though, Paul thinks that she just figured
p309
aVthat he was never going to survive.
p310
aVThis is her just puffing out, you know,
p311
aVsnorting out in disgust.
p312
aV(Laughter)
p313
aVAnd lost interest with him, and went back to what she does best.
p314
aa(lp315
VPaul set out to photograph a relatively
p316
aVmysterious and unknown creature,
p317
aVand came back with not just a collection of photographs,
p318
aVbut an amazing experience and a great story.
p319
aVIt is these kinds of stories,
p320
aVones that go beyond the immediate or just the superficial
p321
aVthat demonstrate the power of photojournalism.
p322
aVI believe that photography can make a real connection to people,
p323
aVand can be employed as a positive agent
p324
aVfor understanding the challenges and opportunities
p325
aVfacing our world today.
p326
aVThank you.
