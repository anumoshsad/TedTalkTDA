VWhen I was growing up in Montana,
p4
aVI had two dreams.
p5
aVI wanted to be a paleontologist,
p6
aVa dinosaur paleontologist,
p7
aVand I wanted to have a pet dinosaur.
p8
aVAnd so that's what I've been striving for
p9
aVall of my life.
p10
aVI was very fortunate
p11
aVearly in my career.
p12
aVI was fortunate
p13
aVin finding things.
p14
aVI wasn't very good at reading things.
p15
aVIn fact, I don't read much of anything.
p16
aVI am extremely dyslexic,
p17
aVand so reading is the hardest thing I do.
p18
aVBut instead, I go out and I find things.
p19
aVThen I just pick things up.
p20
aVI basically practice for finding money on the street.
p21
aV(Laughter)
p22
aVAnd I wander about the hills,
p23
aVand I have found a few things.
p24
aa(lp25
VAnd I have been fortunate enough
p26
aVto find things like the first eggs in the Western hemisphere
p27
aVand the first baby dinosaurs in nests,
p28
aVthe first dinosaur embryos
p29
aVand massive accumulations of bones.
p30
aVAnd it happened to be at a time
p31
aVwhen people were just starting to begin to realize
p32
aVthat dinosaurs weren't the big, stupid, green reptiles
p33
aVthat people had thought for so many years.
p34
aVPeople were starting to get an idea
p35
aVthat dinosaurs were special.
p36
aa(lp37
VAnd so, at that time,
p38
aVI was able to make some interesting hypotheses
p39
aValong with my colleagues.
p40
aVWe were able to actually say
p41
aVthat dinosaurs \u2014 based on the evidence we had \u2014
p42
aVthat dinosaurs built nests
p43
aVand lived in colonies
p44
aVand cared for their young,
p45
aVbrought food to their babies
p46
aVand traveled in gigantic herds.
p47
aVSo it was pretty interesting stuff.
p48
aVI have gone on to find more things
p49
aVand discover that dinosaurs really were very social.
p50
aVWe have found a lot of evidence
p51
aVthat dinosaurs changed
p52
aVfrom when they were juveniles to when they were adults.
p53
aVThe appearance of them would have been different \u2014
p54
aVwhich it is in all social animals.
p55
aVIn social groups of animals,
p56
aVthe juveniles always look different than the adults.
p57
aVThe adults can recognize the juveniles;
p58
aVthe juveniles can recognize the adults.
p59
aVAnd so we're making a better picture
p60
aVof what a dinosaur looks like.
p61
aVAnd they didn't just all chase Jeeps around.
p62
aa(lp63
V(Laughter)
p64
aa(lp65
VBut it is that social thing
p66
aVthat I guess attracted Michael Crichton.
p67
aVAnd in his book, he talked about the social animals.
p68
aVAnd then Steven Spielberg, of course,
p69
aVdepicts these dinosaurs
p70
aVas being very social creatures.
p71
aVThe theme of this story is building a dinosaur,
p72
aVand so we come to that part of "Jurassic Park."
p73
aVMichael Crichton really was one of the first people
p74
aVto talk about bringing dinosaurs back to life.
p75
aVYou all know the story, right.
p76
aVI mean, I assume everyone here has seen "Jurassic Park."
p77
aa(lp78
VIf you want to make a dinosaur,
p79
aVyou go out, you find yourself a piece of petrified tree sap \u2014
p80
aVotherwise known as amber \u2014
p81
aVthat has some blood-sucking insects in it,
p82
aVgood ones,
p83
aVand you get your insect and you drill into it
p84
aVand you suck out some DNA,
p85
aVbecause obviously all insects that sucked blood in those days
p86
aVsucked dinosaur DNA out.
p87
aVAnd you take your DNA back to the laboratory
p88
aVand you clone it.
p89
aVAnd I guess you inject it into maybe an ostrich egg,
p90
aVor something like that,
p91
aVand then you wait,
p92
aVand, lo and behold, out pops a little baby dinosaur.
p93
aVAnd everybody's happy about that.
p94
aV(Laughter)
p95
aVAnd they're happy over and over again.
p96
aVThey keep doing it; they just keep making these things.
p97
aVAnd then, then, then, and then ...
p98
aVThen the dinosaurs, being social,
p99
aVact out their socialness,
p100
aVand they get together,
p101
aVand they conspire.
p102
aVAnd, of course, that's what makes Steven Spielberg's movie \u2014
p103
aVconspiring dinosaurs chasing people around.
p104
aa(lp105
VSo I assume everybody knows
p106
aVthat if you actually had a piece of amber and it had an insect in it,
p107
aVand you drilled into it,
p108
aVand you got something out of that insect,
p109
aVand you cloned it, and you did it over and over and over again,
p110
aVyou'd have a room full of mosquitos.
p111
aV(Laughter)
p112
aV(Applause)
p113
aVAnd probably a whole bunch of trees as well.
p114
aa(lp115
VNow if you want dinosaur DNA,
p116
aVI say go to the dinosaur.
p117
aVSo that's what we've done.
p118
aVBack in 1993 when the movie came out,
p119
aVwe actually had a grant from the National Science Foundation
p120
aVto attempt to extract DNA from a dinosaur,
p121
aVand we chose the dinosaur on the left,
p122
aVa Tyrannosaurus rex, which was a very nice specimen.
p123
aVAnd one of my former doctoral students,
p124
aVDr. Mary Schweitzer,
p125
aVactually had the background
p126
aVto do this sort of thing.
p127
aVAnd so she looked into the bone of this T. rex,
p128
aVone of the thigh bones,
p129
aVand she actually found
p130
aVsome very interesting structures in there.
p131
aVThey found these red circular-looking objects,
p132
aVand they looked, for all the world,
p133
aVlike red blood cells.
p134
aVAnd they're in
p135
aVwhat appear to be the blood channels
p136
aVthat go through the bone.
p137
aVAnd so she thought, well, what the heck.
p138
aVSo she sampled some material out of it.
p139
aVNow it wasn't DNA; she didn't find DNA.
p140
aVBut she did find heme,
p141
aVwhich is the biological foundation
p142
aVof hemoglobin.
p143
aVAnd that was really cool.
p144
aVThat was interesting.
p145
aVThat was \u2014 here we have 65-million-year-old heme.
p146
aVWell we tried and tried
p147
aVand we couldn't really get anything else out of it.
p148
aa(lp149
VSo a few years went by,
p150
aVand then we started the Hell Creek Project.
p151
aVAnd the Hell Creek Project was this massive undertaking
p152
aVto get as many dinosaurs as we could possibly find,
p153
aVand hopefully find some dinosaurs
p154
aVthat had more material in them.
p155
aVAnd out in eastern Montana
p156
aVthere's a lot of space, a lot of badlands,
p157
aVand not very many people,
p158
aVand so you can go out there and find a lot of stuff.
p159
aVAnd we did find a lot of stuff.
p160
aVWe found a lot of Tyrannosaurs,
p161
aVbut we found one special Tyrannosaur,
p162
aVand we called it B-rex.
p163
aVAnd B-rex was found
p164
aVunder a thousand cubic yards of rock.
p165
aVIt wasn't a very complete T. rex,
p166
aVand it wasn't a very big T. rex,
p167
aVbut it was a very special B-rex.
p168
aVAnd I and my colleagues cut into it,
p169
aVand we were able to determine,
p170
aVby looking at lines of arrested growth, some lines in it,
p171
aVthat B-rex had died at the age of 16.
p172
aVWe don't really know how long dinosaurs lived,
p173
aVbecause we haven't found the oldest one yet.
p174
aVBut this one died at the age of 16.
p175
aa(lp176
VWe gave samples to Mary Schweitzer,
p177
aVand she was actually able to determine
p178
aVthat B-rex was a female
p179
aVbased on medullary tissue
p180
aVfound on the inside of the bone.
p181
aVMedullary tissue is the calcium build-up,
p182
aVthe calcium storage basically,
p183
aVwhen an animal is pregnant,
p184
aVwhen a bird is pregnant.
p185
aVSo here was the character
p186
aVthat linked birds and dinosaurs.
p187
aVBut Mary went further.
p188
aVShe took the bone, and she dumped it into acid.
p189
aVNow we all know that bones are fossilized,
p190
aVand so if you dump it into acid,
p191
aVthere shouldn't be anything left.
p192
aVBut there was something left.
p193
aVThere were blood vessels left.
p194
aVThere were flexible, clear blood vessels.
p195
aVAnd so here was the first soft tissue from a dinosaur.
p196
aVIt was extraordinary.
p197
aVBut she also found osteocytes,
p198
aVwhich are the cells that laid down the bones.
p199
aVAnd try and try, we could not find DNA,
p200
aVbut she did find evidence of proteins.
p201
aa(lp202
VBut we thought maybe \u2014
p203
aVwell, we thought maybe
p204
aVthat the material was breaking down after it was coming out of the ground.
p205
aVWe thought maybe it was deteriorating very fast.
p206
aVAnd so we built a laboratory
p207
aVin the back of an 18-wheeler trailer,
p208
aVand actually took the laboratory to the field
p209
aVwhere we could get better samples.
p210
aVAnd we did. We got better material.
p211
aVThe cells looked better.
p212
aVThe vessels looked better.
p213
aVFound the protein collagen.
p214
aVI mean, it was wonderful stuff.
p215
aVBut it's not dinosaur DNA.
p216
aVSo we have discovered
p217
aVthat dinosaur DNA, and all DNA,
p218
aVjust breaks down too fast.
p219
aVWe're just not going to be able
p220
aVto do what they did in "Jurassic Park."
p221
aVWe're not going to be able to make a dinosaur
p222
aVbased on a dinosaur.
p223
aa(lp224
VBut birds are dinosaurs.
p225
aVBirds are living dinosaurs.
p226
aVWe actually classify them
p227
aVas dinosaurs.
p228
aVWe now call them non-avian dinosaurs
p229
aVand avian dinosaurs.
p230
aVSo the non-avian dinosaurs
p231
aVare the big clunky ones that went extinct.
p232
aVAvian dinosaurs are our modern birds.
p233
aVSo we don't have to make a dinosaur
p234
aVbecause we already have them.
p235
aa(lp236
V(Laughter)
p237
aa(lp238
VI know, you're as bad as the sixth-graders.
p239
aV(Laughter)
p240
aVThe sixth-graders look at it and they say, "No."
p241
aV(Laughter)
p242
aV"You can call it a dinosaur,
p243
aVbut look at the velociraptor: the velociraptor is cool."
p244
aV(Laughter)
p245
aV"The chicken is not."
p246
aV(Laughter)
p247
aVSo this is our problem,
p248
aVas you can imagine.
p249
aVThe chicken is a dinosaur.
p250
aVI mean it really is.
p251
aVYou can't argue with it
p252
aVbecause we're the classifiers and we've classified it that way.
p253
aV(Laughter)
p254
aV(Applause)
p255
aVBut the sixth-graders demand it.
p256
aV"Fix the chicken."
p257
aV(Laughter)
p258
aVSo that's what I'm here to tell you about:
p259
aVhow we are going to fix a chicken.
p260
aa(lp261
VSo we have a number of ways
p262
aVthat we actually can fix the chicken.
p263
aVBecause evolution works,
p264
aVwe actually have some evolutionary tools.
p265
aVWe'll call them biological modification tools.
p266
aVWe have selection.
p267
aVAnd we know selection works.
p268
aVWe started out with a wolf-like creature
p269
aVand we ended up with a Maltese.
p270
aVI mean, that's \u2014
p271
aVthat's definitely genetic modification.
p272
aVOr any of the other funny-looking little dogs.
p273
aVWe also have transgenesis.
p274
aVTransgenesis is really cool too.
p275
aVThat's where you take a gene out of one animal and stick it in another one.
p276
aVThat's how people make GloFish.
p277
aVYou take a glow gene
p278
aVout of a coral or a jellyfish
p279
aVand you stick it in a zebrafish,
p280
aVand, puff, they glow.
p281
aVAnd that's pretty cool.
p282
aVAnd they obviously make a lot of money off of them.
p283
aVAnd now they're making Glow-rabbits
p284
aVand Glow-all-sorts-of-things.
p285
aVI guess we could make a glow chicken.
p286
aV(Laughter)
p287
aVBut I don't think that'll satisfy the sixth-graders either.
p288
aa(lp289
VBut there's another thing.
p290
aVThere's what we call atavism activation.
p291
aVAnd atavism activation
p292
aVis basically \u2014
p293
aVan atavism is an ancestral characteristic.
p294
aVYou heard
p295
aVthat occasionally children are born with tails,
p296
aVand it's because it's an ancestral characteristic.
p297
aVAnd so there are a number of atavisms
p298
aVthat can happen.
p299
aVSnakes are occasionally born with legs.
p300
aVAnd here's an example.
p301
aVThis is a chicken with teeth.
p302
aVA fellow by the name of Matthew Harris
p303
aVat the University of Wisconsin in Madison
p304
aVactually figured out a way to stimulate
p305
aVthe gene for teeth,
p306
aVand so was able to actually turn the tooth gene on
p307
aVand produce teeth in chickens.
p308
aVNow that's a good characteristic.
p309
aVWe can save that one.
p310
aVWe know we can use that.
p311
aVWe can make a chicken with teeth.
p312
aVThat's getting closer.
p313
aVThat's better than a glowing chicken.
p314
aa(lp315
V(Laughter)
p316
aa(lp317
VA friend of mine, a colleague of mine,
p318
aVDr. Hans Larsson at McGill University,
p319
aVis actually looking at atavisms.
p320
aVAnd he's looking at them
p321
aVby looking at the embryo genesis of birds
p322
aVand actually looking at how they develop,
p323
aVand he's interested in how birds actually lost their tail.
p324
aVHe's also interested in the transformation
p325
aVof the arm, the hand, to the wing.
p326
aVHe's looking for those genes as well.
p327
aVAnd I said, "Well, if you can find those,
p328
aVI can just reverse them
p329
aVand make what I need to make for the sixth-graders."
p330
aVAnd so he agreed.
p331
aVAnd so that's what we're looking into.
p332
aa(lp333
VIf you look at dinosaur hands,
p334
aVa velociraptor
p335
aVhas that cool-looking hand with the claws on it.
p336
aVArchaeopteryx, which is a bird, a primitive bird,
p337
aVstill has that very primitive hand.
p338
aVBut as you can see, the pigeon,
p339
aVor a chicken or anything else, another bird,
p340
aVhas kind of a weird-looking hand,
p341
aVbecause the hand is a wing.
p342
aVBut the cool thing is
p343
aVthat, if you look in the embryo,
p344
aVas the embryo is developing
p345
aVthe hand actually looks
p346
aVpretty much like the archaeopteryx hand.
p347
aVIt has the three fingers, the three digits.
p348
aVBut a gene turns on that actually fuses those together.
p349
aVAnd so what we're looking for is that gene.
p350
aVWe want to stop that gene from turning on,
p351
aVfusing those hands together,
p352
aVso we can get a chicken that hatches out with a three-fingered hand,
p353
aVlike the archaeopteryx.
p354
aVAnd the same goes for the tails.
p355
aVBirds have basically
p356
aVrudimentary tails.
p357
aVAnd so we know
p358
aVthat in embryo,
p359
aVas the animal is developing,
p360
aVit actually has a relatively long tail.
p361
aVBut a gene turns on
p362
aVand resorbs the tail, gets rid of it.
p363
aVSo that's the other gene we're looking for.
p364
aVWe want to stop that tail from resorbing.
p365
aa(lp366
VSo what we're trying to do really
p367
aVis take our chicken,
p368
aVmodify it
p369
aVand make the chickenosaurus.
p370
aV(Laughter)
p371
aVIt's a cooler-looking chicken.
p372
aVBut it's just the very basics.
p373
aVSo that really is what we're doing.
p374
aVAnd people always say, "Why do that?
p375
aVWhy make this thing?
p376
aVWhat good is it?"
p377
aVWell, that's a good question.
p378
aVActually, I think it's a great way to teach kids
p379
aVabout evolutionary biology
p380
aVand developmental biology
p381
aVand all sorts of things.
p382
aVAnd quite frankly, I think
p383
aVif Colonel Sanders
p384
aVwas to be careful how he worded it,
p385
aVhe could actually advertise an extra piece.
p386
aV(Laughter)
p387
aa(lp388
VAnyway \u2014
p389
aVWhen our dino-chicken hatches,
p390
aVit will be, obviously, the poster child,
p391
aVor what you might call a poster chick,
p392
aVfor technology, entertainment and design.
p393
