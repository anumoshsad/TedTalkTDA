VSo this is a picture of my dad and me, at the beach in Far Rockaway,
p4
aVor actually Rockaway Park.
p5
aVI'm the one with the blond hair.
p6
aVMy dad's the guy with the cigarette.
p7
aVIt was the 60's.
p8
aVA lot of people smoked back then.
p9
aVIn the summer of 2009, my dad was diagnosed with lung cancer.
p10
aVCancer is one of those things that actually touches everybody.
p11
aVIf you're a man in the US,
p12
aVyou've got about a one in two chance
p13
aVof being diagnosed with cancer during your lifetime.
p14
aVIf you're a woman, you've got about a one in three chance
p15
aVof being diagnosed with cancer.
p16
aVEverybody knows somebody who's been diagnosed with cancer.
p17
aa(lp18
VNow, my dad's doing better today,
p19
aVand part of the reason for that is that he was able to participate in the trial
p20
aVof an experimental new drug that happened to be specially formulated
p21
aVand very good for his particular kind of cancer.
p22
aVThere are over 200 kinds of cancer.
p23
aVAnd what I want to talk about today
p24
aVis how we can help more people like my dad,
p25
aVbecause we have to change the way we think about raising money
p26
aVto fund cancer research.
p27
aa(lp28
VSo a while after my dad was diagnosed,
p29
aVI was having coffee with my friend Andrew Lo.
p30
aVHe's the head of the Laboratory for Financial Engineering at MIT,
p31
aVwhere I also have a position,
p32
aVand we were talking about cancer.
p33
aVAnd Andrew had been doing his own bits of research,
p34
aVand one of the things that he had been told
p35
aVand that he'd learned from studying the literature
p36
aVwas that there's actually a big bottleneck.
p37
aVIt's very difficult to develop new drugs,
p38
aVand the reason it's difficult to develop new drugs
p39
aVis because in the early stages of drug development,
p40
aVthe drugs are very risky, and they're very expensive.
p41
aVSo Andrew asked me if I'd want to maybe work with him a bit,
p42
aVwork on some of the math and the analytics
p43
aVand see if we could figure out something we could do.
p44
aa(lp45
VNow I'm not a scientist.
p46
aVYou know, I don't know how to build a drug.
p47
aVAnd none of my coauthors, Andrew Lo or Jose-Maria Fernandez or David Fagnan \u2014
p48
aVnone of those guys are scientists either.
p49
aVWe don't know the first thing about how to make a cancer drug.
p50
aVBut we know a little bit about risk mitigation
p51
aVand a little bit about financial engineering,
p52
aVand so we started thinking, what could we do?
p53
aVI'm going to tell you about some work
p54
aVwe've been doing over the last couple years
p55
aVthat we think could fundamentally change the way
p56
aVresearch for cancer and lots of other things gets done.
p57
aVWe want to let the research drive the funding,
p58
aVnot the other way around.
p59
aa(lp60
VSo in order to get started,
p61
aVlet me tell you how you get a drug financed.
p62
aVImagine that you're in your lab \u2014 you're a scientist, you're not like me \u2014
p63
aVand you've developed a new compound
p64
aVthat you think might be therapeutic for somebody with cancer.
p65
aVWell, what you do is, you test in animals, you test in test tubes,
p66
aVbut there's this notion of going from the bench to the bedside,
p67
aVand in order to get from the bench, the lab, to the bedside, to the patients,
p68
aVyou've got to get the drug tested.
p69
aVAnd the way the drug gets tested
p70
aVis through a series of, basically, experiments,
p71
aVthrough these large, they're called trials,
p72
aVthat they do to determine whether the drug is safe
p73
aVand whether it works and all these things.
p74
aVSo the FDA has a very specific protocol.
p75
aVIn the first phase of this testing,
p76
aVwhich is called testing for toxicity, it's called Phase I.
p77
aVIn the first phase, you give the drug to healthy people
p78
aVand you see if it actually makes them sick.
p79
aVIn other words, are the side effects just so severe
p80
aVthat no matter how much good it does,
p81
aVit's not going to be worth it?
p82
aVDoes it cause heart attacks, kill people, liver failure?
p83
aVAnd it turns out, that's a pretty high hurdle.
p84
aVAbout a third of all drugs drop out at that point.
p85
aVIn the next phase, you test to see if the drug's effective,
p86
aVand you give it to people with cancer
p87
aVand you see if it makes them better.
p88
aVAnd that's also a higher hurdle. People drop out.
p89
aVAnd in the third phase, you test it on a very large sample,
p90
aVand you're trying to determine what the right dose is,
p91
aVis it better than what's available today? If not, then why build it?
p92
aVWhen you're done with all that,
p93
aVwhat you have is a very small percentage of drugs
p94
aVthat start the process actually come out the other side.
p95
aVSo those blue bottles \u2014 those blue bottles save lives,
p96
aVand they're also worth billions, sometimes billions a year.
p97
aa(lp98
VSo now here's a question:
p99
aVif I were to ask you, for example,
p100
aVto make a one-time investment of, say, 200 million dollars
p101
aVto buy one of those bottles,
p102
aVso 200 million dollars up front, one time, to buy one of those bottles,
p103
aVI won't tell you which one it is,
p104
aVand in 10 years, I'll tell you whether you have one of the blue ones.
p105
aVDoes that sound like a good deal for anybody?
p106
aVNo. No, right?
p107
aVAnd of course, it's a very, very risky trial position,
p108
aVand that's why it's very hard to get funding,
p109
aVbut to a first approximation, that's actually the proposal.
p110
aVYou have to fund these things from the early stages on.
p111
aVIt takes a long time.
p112
aa(lp113
VSo Andrew said to me, he said,
p114
aV"What if we stop thinking about these as drugs?
p115
aVWhat if we start thinking about them as financial assets?"
p116
aVThey've got really weird payoff structures and all that,
p117
aVbut let's throw everything we know about financial engineering at them.
p118
aVLet's see if we can use all the tricks of the trade
p119
aVto figure out how to make these drugs work as financial assets.
p120
aa(lp121
VLet's create a giant fund.
p122
aVIn finance, we know what to do with assets that are risky.
p123
aVYou put them in a portfolio and you try to smooth out the returns.
p124
aVSo we did some math, and it turned out you could make this work,
p125
aVbut in order to make it work, you need about 80 to 150 drugs.
p126
aa(lp127
VNow the good news is, there's plenty of drugs
p128
aVthat are waiting to be tested.
p129
aVWe've been told that there's a backlog of about 20 years of drugs
p130
aVthat are waiting to be tested but can't be funded.
p131
aVIn fact, that early stage of the funding process,
p132
aVthat Phase I and preclinical stuff,
p133
aVthat's actually, in the industry, called the Valley of Death
p134
aVbecause it's where drugs go to die.
p135
aVIt's very hard to for them to get through there,
p136
aVand of course, if you can't get through there,
p137
aVyou can't get to the later stages.
p138
aa(lp139
VSo we did this math, and we figured out, OK,
p140
aVwell, you need about 80 to, say, 150, or something like that, drugs.
p141
aVAnd then we did a little more math, and we said, OK,
p142
aVwell, that's a fund of about three to 15 billion dollars.
p143
aVSo we kind of created a new problem by solving the old one.
p144
aVWe got rid of the risk, but now we need a lot of capital,
p145
aVand you can only get that kind of capital in the capital markets.
p146
aVVenture capitalists and philanthropies don't have it.
p147
aVBut we have to figure out how to get people in the capital markets,
p148
aVwho traditionally don't invest in this, to want to invest in this stuff.
p149
aVSo again, financial engineering was helpful here.
p150
aVImagine the megafund starts empty,
p151
aVand what it does is it issues some debt and some equity,
p152
aVand that generates cash flow.
p153
aVThat cash flow is used, then, to buy that big portfolio of drugs that you need,
p154
aVand those drugs start working their way through that approval process,
p155
aVand each time they go through a phase of approval,
p156
aVthey gain value.
p157
aVMost of them don't make it, but a few of them do,
p158
aVand with the ones that gain value, you can sell some,
p159
aVand when you sell them,
p160
aVyou have money to pay the interest on those bonds,
p161
aVbut also to fund the next round of trials.
p162
aVIt's almost self-funding.
p163
aVYou do that for the course of the transaction,
p164
aVand when you're done, you liquidate the portfolio,
p165
aVpay back the bonds, and you can give the equity holders a nice return.
p166
aa(lp167
VThat was the theory, and we talked about it,
p168
aVwe did a bunch of experiments,
p169
aVand then we said, let's really try to test it.
p170
aVWe spent the next two years doing research.
p171
aVWe talked to hundreds of experts in drug financing and venture capital.
p172
aVWe talked to people who have developed drugs.
p173
aVWe talked to pharmaceutical companies.
p174
aVWe actually looked at the data for drugs,
p175
aVover 2,000 drugs that had been approved or denied or withdrawn,
p176
aVand we also ran millions of simulations.
p177
aVAnd all that actually took a lot of time.
p178
aVBut when we were done, we found something that was sort of surprising.
p179
aVIt was feasible to structure that fund
p180
aVsuch that when you were done structuring it,
p181
aVyou could actually produce low-risk bonds that would be attractive to bond holders,
p182
aVthat would give you yields of about five to eight percent,
p183
aVand you could produce equity
p184
aVthat would give equity holders about a 12 percent return.
p185
aVNow those returns aren't going to be attractive to a venture capitalist.
p186
aVThey want to make those big bets
p187
aVand get those billion dollar payoffs.
p188
aVBut it turns out there are lots of other folks that would be interested.
p189
aVThat's right in the investment sweet spot of pension funds and 401(k) plans
p190
aVand all this other stuff.
p191
aa(lp192
VSo we published some articles in the academic press,
p193
aVin medical journals, in finance journals.
p194
aVBut it wasn't until we actually got the popular press interested in this
p195
aVthat we began to get some traction.
p196
aa(lp197
VWe wanted to do more than just make people aware of it.
p198
aVWe wanted people to get involved.
p199
aVSo we took all of our computer code and made that available online
p200
aVunder an open-source license to anybody that wanted it.
p201
aVAnd you guys can download it today
p202
aVif you want to run your own experiments to see if this would work.
p203
aVAnd that was really effective,
p204
aVbecause people that didn't believe our assumptions
p205
aVcould try their own and see how it would work.
p206
aa(lp207
VNow there's an obvious problem, which is,
p208
aVis there enough money in the world to fund this?
p209
aVI've told you there's enough drugs, but is there enough money?
p210
aVThere's 100 trillion dollars of capital
p211
aVcurrently invested in fixed-income securities.
p212
aVThat's a hundred thousand billion.
p213
aVThere's plenty of money.
p214
aa(lp215
V(Laughter)
p216
aa(lp217
VBut we realized it's more than just money that's required.
p218
aVWe had to get people motivated, involved,
p219
aVand get them to understand this.
p220
aVAnd we started thinking about all the different things that could go wrong.
p221
aVWhat are all the challenges that might get in the way?
p222
aVAnd we had a long list.
p223
aVWe assigned a bunch of people, including ourselves,
p224
aVdifferent pieces of this problem.
p225
aVAnd we said, could you start a work stream on credit risk?
p226
aVCould you start a work stream on the regulatory aspects?
p227
aVCould you start a work stream on how you would manage so many projects?
p228
aVAnd we had all these experts get together and do these different work streams,
p229
aVand then we held a conference.
p230
aVThe conference was held over this past summer.
p231
aVIt was an invitation-only conference.
p232
aVIt was sponsored by the American Cancer Society
p233
aVand done in collaboration with the National Cancer Institute.
p234
aVWe had experts from every field we thought would be important,
p235
aVincluding the government, and people that run research centers,
p236
aVand for two days they heard the reports
p237
aVfrom those five work streams, and talked about it.
p238
aVIt was the first time the people who could make this happen
p239
aVsat across the table from each other and had these conversations.
p240
aa(lp241
VNow these conferences, it's typical to have a dinner,
p242
aVand at that dinner, you get to know each other,
p243
aVsort of like what we're doing here.
p244
aVI happened to look out the window,
p245
aVand hand on my heart,
p246
aVon the night of this conference \u2014 it was the summertime \u2014
p247
aVand that's what I saw, a double rainbow.
p248
aVSo I'd like to think it was a good sign.
p249
aa(lp250
VSince the conference, we've got people working between Paris and San Francisco,
p251
aVlots of different folks working on this
p252
aVto try to see if we can really make it happen.
p253
aVWe're not looking to start a fund, but we want somebody else to do this.
p254
aVBecause, again, I'm not a scientist.
p255
aVI can't build a drug.
p256
aVI'm never going to have enough money to fund even one of those trials.
p257
aVBut all of us together, with our 401(k)s,
p258
aVwith our 529 plans, with our pension plans,
p259
aVall of us together can actually fund hundreds of trials
p260
aVand get paid well for doing it
p261
aVand save millions of lives like my dad.
p262
aa(lp263
