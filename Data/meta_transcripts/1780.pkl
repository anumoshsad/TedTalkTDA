VClouds.
p4
aVHave you ever noticed how much people moan about them?
p5
aVThey get a bad rap.
p6
aVIf you think about it, the English language
p7
aVhas written into it negative associations towards the clouds.
p8
aVSomeone who's down or depressed,
p9
aVthey're under a cloud.
p10
aVAnd when there's bad news in store,
p11
aVthere's a cloud on the horizon.
p12
aVI saw an article the other day.
p13
aVIt was about problems with computer processing
p14
aVover the Internet.
p15
aV"A cloud over the cloud," was the headline.
p16
aVIt seems like they're everyone's default
p17
aVdoom-and-gloom metaphor.
p18
aVBut I think they're beautiful, don't you?
p19
aVIt's just that their beauty is missed
p20
aVbecause they're so omnipresent,
p21
aVso, I don't know, commonplace,
p22
aVthat people don't notice them.
p23
aVThey don't notice the beauty, but they don't even notice the clouds
p24
aVunless they get in the way of the sun.
p25
aVAnd so people think of clouds as
p26
aVthings that get in the way.
p27
aVThey think of them as the annoying, frustrating obstructions,
p28
aVand then they rush off and do some blue-sky thinking.
p29
aV(Laughter)
p30
aVBut most people, when you stop to ask them,
p31
aVwill admit to harboring a strange sort of fondness for clouds.
p32
aVIt's like a nostalgic fondness,
p33
aVand they make them think of their youth.
p34
aVWho here can't remember thinking, well,
p35
aVlooking and finding shapes in the clouds
p36
aVwhen they were kids?
p37
aVYou know, when you were masters of daydreaming?
p38
aVAristophanes, the ancient Greek playwright,
p39
aVhe described the clouds as the patron godesses
p40
aVof idle fellows
p41
aVtwo and a half thousand years ago,
p42
aVand you can see what he means.
p43
aVIt's just that these days, us adults seem reluctant
p44
aVto allow ourselves the indulgence
p45
aVof just allowing our imaginations
p46
aVto drift along in the breeze, and I think that's a pity.
p47
aVI think we should perhaps do a bit more of it.
p48
aVI think we should be a bit more willing, perhaps,
p49
aVto look at the beautiful sight of the sunlight bursting out
p50
aVfrom behind the clouds and go, "Wait a minute,
p51
aVthat's two cats dancing the salsa!"
p52
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p53
aVOr seeing the big, white, puffy one up there
p54
aVover the shopping center looks like
p55
aVthe Abominable Snowman going to rob a bank.
p56
aV(Laughter)
p57
aVThey're like nature's version of those inkblot images,
p58
aVyou know, that shrinks used to show their patients
p59
aVin the '60s,
p60
aVand I think if you consider the shapes you see in the clouds,
p61
aVyou'll save money on psychoanalysis bills.
p62
aVLet's say you're in love. All right?
p63
aVAnd you look up and what do you see?
p64
aVRight? Or maybe the opposite.
p65
aVYou've just been dumped by your partner,
p66
aVand everywhere you look, it's kissing couples.
p67
aV(Laughter)
p68
aVPerhaps you're having a moment of existential angst.
p69
aVYou know, you're thinking about your own mortality.
p70
aVAnd there, on the horizon, it's the Grim Reaper.
p71
aV(Laughter)
p72
aVOr maybe you see a topless sunbather.
p73
aV(Laughter)
p74
aVWhat would that mean?
p75
aVWhat would that mean? I have no idea.
p76
aVBut one thing I do know is this:
p77
aVThe bad press that clouds get is totally unfair.
p78
aVI think we should stand up for them,
p79
aVwhich is why, a few years ago,
p80
aVI started the Cloud Appreciation Society.
p81
aVTens of thousands of members now
p82
aVin almost 100 countries around the world.
p83
aVAnd all these photographs that I'm showing,
p84
aVthey were sent in by members.
p85
aVAnd the society exists to remind people of this:
p86
aVClouds are not something to moan about.
p87
aVFar from it. They are, in fact,
p88
aVthe most diverse, evocative, poetic aspect of nature.
p89
aVI think, if you live with your head in the clouds
p90
aVevery now and then, it helps you keep your feet on the ground.
p91
aVAnd I want to show you why, with the help of
p92
aVsome of my favorite types of clouds.
p93
aVLet's start with this one. It's the cirrus cloud,
p94
aVnamed after the Latin for a lock of hair.
p95
aVIt's composed entirely of ice crystals
p96
aVcascading from the upper reaches of the troposphere,
p97
aVand as these ice crystals fall,
p98
aVthey pass through different layers with different winds
p99
aVand they speed up and slow down,
p100
aVgiving the cloud these brush-stroked appearances,
p101
aVthese brush-stroke forms known as fall streaks.
p102
aVAnd these winds up there can be very, very fierce.
p103
aVThey can be 200 miles an hour, 300 miles an hour.
p104
aVThese clouds are bombing along,
p105
aVbut from all the way down here,
p106
aVthey appear to be moving gracefully, slowly,
p107
aVlike most clouds.
p108
aVAnd so to tune into the clouds is to slow down,
p109
aVto calm down.
p110
aVIt's like a bit of everyday meditation.
p111
aVThose are common clouds.
p112
aVWhat about rarer ones, like the lenticularis,
p113
aVthe UFO-shaped lenticularis cloud?
p114
aVThese clouds form in the region of mountains.
p115
aVWhen the wind passes, rises to pass over the mountain,
p116
aVit can take on a wave-like path in the lee of the peak,
p117
aVwith these clouds hovering at the crest
p118
aVof these invisible standing waves of air,
p119
aVthese flying saucer-like forms,
p120
aVand some of the early black-and-white UFO photos
p121
aVare in fact lenticularis clouds. It's true.
p122
aVA little rarer are the fallstreak holes. All right?
p123
aVThis is when a layer is made up of very, very cold
p124
aVwater droplets, and in one region they start to freeze,
p125
aVand this freezing sets off a chain reaction which spreads outwards
p126
aVwith the ice crystals cascading and falling down below,
p127
aVgiving the appearance of jellyfish tendrils down below.
p128
aVRarer still, the Kelvin\u2013Helmholtz cloud.
p129
aVNot a very snappy name. Needs a rebrand.
p130
aVThis looks like a series of breaking waves,
p131
aVand it's caused by shearing winds \u2014 the wind
p132
aVabove the cloud layer and below the cloud layer
p133
aVdiffer significantly, and in the middle, in between,
p134
aVyou get this undulating of the air,
p135
aVand if the difference in those speeds is just right,
p136
aVthe tops of the undulations curl over
p137
aVin these beautiful breaking wave-like vortices.
p138
aVAll right. Those are rarer clouds than the cirrus,
p139
aVbut they're not that rare.
p140
aVIf you look up, and you pay attention to the sky,
p141
aVyou'll see them sooner or later,
p142
aVmaybe not quite as dramatic as these, but you'll see them.
p143
aVAnd you'll see them around where you live.
p144
aVClouds are the most egalitarian
p145
aVof nature's displays, because we all have a good,
p146
aVfantastic view of the sky.
p147
aVAnd these clouds, these rarer clouds,
p148
aVremind us that the exotic can be found in the everyday.
p149
aVNothing is more nourishing, more stimulating
p150
aVto an active, inquiring mind than being surprised,
p151
aVbeing amazed. It's why we're all here at TED, right?
p152
aVBut you don't need to rush off
p153
aVaway from the familiar, across the world
p154
aVto be surprised.
p155
aVYou just need to step outside,
p156
aVpay attention to what's so commonplace, so everyday,
p157
aVso mundane that everybody else misses it.
p158
aVOne cloud that people rarely miss is this one:
p159
aVthe cumulonimbus storm cloud.
p160
aVIt's what's produces thunder and lightning and hail.
p161
aVThese clouds spread out at the top in this enormous
p162
aVanvil fashion stretching 10 miles up into the atmosphere.
p163
aVThey are an expression of the majestic architecture
p164
aVof our atmosphere.
p165
aVBut from down below, they are the embodiment
p166
aVof the powerful, elemental force and power
p167
aVthat drives our atmosphere.
p168
aVTo be there is to be connected in the driving rain
p169
aVand the hail, to feel connected to our atmosphere.
p170
aVIt's to be reminded that we are creatures
p171
aVthat inhabit this ocean of air.
p172
aVWe don't live beneath the sky. We live within it.
p173
aVAnd that connection, that visceral connection to our atmosphere
p174
aVfeels to me like an antidote.
p175
aVIt's an antidote to the growing tendency we have
p176
aVto feel that we can really ever experience life
p177
aVby watching it on a computer screen, you know,
p178
aVwhen we're in a wi-fi zone.
p179
aVBut the one cloud that best expresses
p180
aVwhy cloudspotting is more valuable today than ever
p181
aVis this one, the cumulus cloud.
p182
aVRight? It forms on a sunny day.
p183
aVIf you close your eyes and think of a cloud,
p184
aVit's probably one of these that comes to mind.
p185
aVAll those cloud shapes at the beginning,
p186
aVthose were cumulus clouds.
p187
aVThe sharp, crisp outlines of this formation
p188
aVmake it the best one for finding shapes in.
p189
aVAnd it reminds us
p190
aVof the aimless nature of cloudspotting,
p191
aVwhat an aimless activity it is.
p192
aVYou're not going to change the world
p193
aVby lying on your back and gazing up at the sky, are you?
p194
aVIt's pointless. It's a pointless activity,
p195
aVwhich is precisely why it's so important.
p196
aVThe digital world conspires to make us feel
p197
aVeternally busy, perpetually busy.
p198
aVYou know, when you're not dealing with
p199
aVthe traditional pressures of earning a living
p200
aVand putting food on the table, raising a family,
p201
aVwriting thank you letters,
p202
aVyou have to now contend with
p203
aVanswering a mountain of unanswered emails,
p204
aVupdating a Facebook page,
p205
aVfeeding your Twitter feed.
p206
aVAnd cloudspotting legitimizes doing nothing.
p207
aV(Laughter)
p208
aVAnd sometimes we need \u2014
p209
aV(Applause)
p210
aVSometimes we need excuses to do nothing.
p211
aVWe need to be reminded by these
p212
aVpatron goddesses of idle fellows
p213
aVthat slowing down
p214
aVand being in the present, not thinking about
p215
aVwhat you've got to do and what you should have done,
p216
aVbut just being here, letting your imagination
p217
aVlift from the everyday concerns down here
p218
aVand just being in the present, it's good for you,
p219
aVand it's good for the way you feel.
p220
aVIt's good for your ideas. It's good for your creativity.
p221
aVIt's good for your soul.
p222
aVSo keep looking up,
p223
aVmarvel at the ephemeral beauty,
p224
aVand always remember to live life with your head in the clouds.
p225
aVThank you very much.
