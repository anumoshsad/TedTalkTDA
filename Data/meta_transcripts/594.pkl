VSo it was about four years ago, five years ago,
p4
aVI was sitting on a stage in Philadelphia, I think it was,
p5
aVwith a bag similar to this.
p6
aVAnd I was pulling a molecule out of this bag.
p7
aVAnd I was saying, you don't know this molecule really well,
p8
aVbut your body knows it extremely well.
p9
aVAnd I was thinking that your body hated it, at the time,
p10
aVbecause we are very immune to this. This is called alpha-gal epitope.
p11
aVAnd the fact that pig heart valves have lots of these on them
p12
aVis the reason that you can't transplant a pig heart valve into a person easily.
p13
aa(lp14
VActually our body doesn't hate these.
p15
aVOur body loves these. It eats them.
p16
aVI mean, the cells in our immune system are always hungry.
p17
aVAnd if an antibody is stuck to one of these things
p18
aVon the cell, it means "that's food."
p19
aVNow, I was thinking about that and I said, you know, we've got this
p20
aVimmune response to this ridiculous molecule
p21
aVthat we don't make, and we see it a lot in other animals and stuff.
p22
aVBut I said we can't get rid of it,
p23
aVbecause all the people who tried to transplant heart valves
p24
aVfound out you can't get rid of that immunity.
p25
aa(lp26
VAnd I said, why don't you use that?
p27
aVWhat if I could stick this molecule,
p28
aVslap it onto a bacteria
p29
aVthat was pathogenic to me, that had just invaded my lungs?
p30
aVI mean I could immediately tap into
p31
aVan immune response that was already there,
p32
aVwhere it was not going to take five or six days to develop it \u2014
p33
aVit was going to immediately attack whatever this thing was on.
p34
aVIt was kind of like the same thing that happens when you,
p35
aVlike when you're getting stopped for a traffic ticket in L.A.,
p36
aVand the cop drops a bag of marijuana in the back of your car,
p37
aVand then charges you for possession of marijuana.
p38
aVIt's like this very fast, very efficient way to get people off the street.
p39
aa(lp40
V(Laughter)
p41
aa(lp42
VSo you can take a bacteria
p43
aVthat really doesn't make these things at all,
p44
aVand if you could clamp these on it really well
p45
aVyou have it taken off the street.
p46
aVAnd for certain bacteria
p47
aVwe don't have really efficient ways to do that anymore.
p48
aVOur antibiotics are running out.
p49
aVAnd, I mean, the world apparently is running out too.
p50
aVSo probably it doesn't matter 50 years from now \u2014
p51
aVstreptococcus and stuff like that will be rampant \u2014
p52
aVbecause we won't be here. But if we are \u2014
p53
aV(Laughter)
p54
aVwe're going to need something to do with the bacteria.
p55
aa(lp56
VSo I started working with this thing,
p57
aVwith a bunch of collaborators.
p58
aVAnd trying to attach this to things that were
p59
aVthemselves attached to certain specific target zones,
p60
aVbacteria that we don't like.
p61
aVAnd I feel now like George Bush.
p62
aVIt's like "mission accomplished."
p63
aVSo I might be doing something dumb, just like he was doing at the time.
p64
aVBut basically what I was talking about there we've now gotten to work.
p65
aVAnd it's killing bacteria. It's eating them.
p66
aa(lp67
VThis thing can be stuck, like that little green triangle up there,
p68
aVsort of symbolizing this right now.
p69
aVYou can stick this to something called a DNA aptamer.
p70
aVAnd that DNA aptamer will attach specifically
p71
aVto a target that you have selected for it.
p72
aVSo you can find a little feature on a bacterium that you don't like,
p73
aVlike Staphylococcus \u2014 I don't like it in particular,
p74
aVbecause it killed a professor friend of mine last year.
p75
aVIt doesn't respond to antibiotics. So I don't like it.
p76
aVAnd I'm making an aptamer that will have this attached to it.
p77
aVThat will know how to find Staph when it's in your body,
p78
aVand will alert your immune system to go after it.
p79
aa(lp80
VHere's what happened. See that line on the very top
p81
aVwith the little dots?
p82
aVThat's a bunch of mice that had been poisoned
p83
aVby our scientist friends down in Texas,
p84
aVat Brooks Air Base, with anthrax.
p85
aVAnd they had also been treated with a drug that we made
p86
aVthat would attack anthrax in particular,
p87
aVand direct your immune system to it.
p88
aVYou'll notice they all lived, the ones on the top line \u2014
p89
aVthat's a 100 percent survival rate.
p90
aVAnd they actually lived another 14 days,
p91
aVor 28 when we finally killed them,
p92
aVand took them apart and figured out what went wrong.
p93
aVWhy did they not die?
p94
aVAnd they didn't die because they didn't have anthrax anymore.
p95
aVSo we did it. Okay?
