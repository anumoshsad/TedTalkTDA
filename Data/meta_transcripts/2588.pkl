(lp3
VI remember the very first time I went to a nice restaurant,
p4
aVa really nice restaurant.
p5
aVIt was for a law firm recruitment dinner,
p6
aVand I remember beforehand the waitress walked around
p7
aVand asked whether we wanted some wine,
p8
aVso I said, "Sure, I'll take some white wine."
p9
aa(lp10
VAnd she immediately said,
p11
aV"Would you like sauvignon blanc or chardonnay?"
p12
aa(lp13
VAnd I remember thinking,
p14
aV"Come on, lady, stop with the fancy French words
p15
aVand just give me some white wine."
p16
aVBut I used my powers of deduction
p17
aVand recognized that chardonnay and sauvignon blanc
p18
aVwere two separate types of white wine,
p19
aVand so I told her that I would take the chardonnay,
p20
aVbecause frankly that was the easiest one to pronounce for me.
p21
aa(lp22
VSo I had a lot of experiences like that
p23
aVduring my first couple of years as a law student at Yale,
p24
aVbecause, despite all outward appearances, I'm a cultural outsider.
p25
aVI didn't come from the elites.
p26
aVI didn't come from the Northeast or from San Francisco.
p27
aVI came from a southern Ohio steel town,
p28
aVand it's a town that's really struggling in a lot of ways,
p29
aVways that are indicative of the broader struggles
p30
aVof America's working class.
p31
aVHeroin has moved in,
p32
aVkilling a lot of people, people I know.
p33
aVFamily violence, domestic violence, and divorce have torn apart families.
p34
aVAnd there's a very unique sense of pessimism that's moved in.
p35
aVThink about rising mortality rates in these communities
p36
aVand recognize that for a lot of these folks,
p37
aVthe problems that they're seeing
p38
aVare actually causing rising death rates in their own communities,
p39
aVso there's a very real sense of struggle.
p40
aa(lp41
VI had a very front-row seat to that struggle.
p42
aVMy family has been part of that struggle for a very long time.
p43
aVI come from a family that doesn't have a whole lot of money.
p44
aVThe addiction that plagued my community
p45
aValso plagued my family, and even, sadly, my own mom.
p46
aVThere were a lot of problems that I saw in my own family,
p47
aVproblems caused sometimes by a lack of money,
p48
aVproblems caused sometimes by a lack of access to resources and social capital
p49
aVthat really affected my life.
p50
aa(lp51
VIf you had looked at my life when I was 14 years old
p52
aVand said, "Well, what's going to happen to this kid?"
p53
aVyou would have concluded that I would have struggled
p54
aVwith what academics call upward mobility.
p55
aVSo upward mobility is an abstract term,
p56
aVbut it strikes at something that's very core
p57
aVat the heart of the American Dream.
p58
aVIt's the sense,
p59
aVand it measures whether kids like me
p60
aVwho grow up in poor communities are going to live a better life,
p61
aVwhether they're going to have a chance to live a materially better existence,
p62
aVor whether they're going to stay in the circumstances where they came from.
p63
aVAnd one of the things we've learned, unfortunately,
p64
aVis that upward mobility isn't as high as we'd like it to be in this country,
p65
aVand interestingly, it's very geographically distributed.
p66
aVSo take Utah, for instance.
p67
aVIn Utah a poor kid is actually doing OK,
p68
aVvery likely to live their share and their part in the American Dream.
p69
aVBut if you think of where I'm from,
p70
aVin the South, in Appalachia, in southern Ohio,
p71
aVit's very unlikely that kids like that will rise.
p72
aVThe American Dream in those parts of the country
p73
aVis in a very real sense just a dream.
p74
aa(lp75
VSo why is that happening?
p76
aVSo one reason is obviously economic or structural.
p77
aVSo you think of these areas.
p78
aVThey're beset by these terrible economic trends,
p79
aVbuilt around industries like coal and steel
p80
aVthat make it harder for folks to get ahead.
p81
aVThat's certainly one problem.
p82
aVThere's also the problem of brain drain, where the really talented people,
p83
aVbecause they can't find high-skilled work at home,
p84
aVend up moving elsewhere,
p85
aVso they don't build a business or non-profit where they're from,
p86
aVthey end up going elsewhere and taking their talents with them.
p87
aVThere are failing schools in a lot of these communities,
p88
aVfailing to give kids the educational leg up
p89
aVthat really makes it possible for kids to have opportunities later in life.
p90
aVThese things are all important.
p91
aVI don't mean to discount these structural barriers.
p92
aVBut when I look back at my life and my community,
p93
aVsomething else was going on, something else mattered.
p94
aVIt's difficult to quantify, but it was no less real.
p95
aa(lp96
VSo for starters, there was a very real sense of hopelessness
p97
aVin the community that I grew up in.
p98
aVThere was a sense that kids had that their choices didn't matter.
p99
aVNo matter what happened, no matter how hard they worked,
p100
aVno matter how hard they tried to get ahead,
p101
aVnothing good would happen.
p102
aVSo that's a tough feeling to grow up around.
p103
aVThat's a tough mindset to penetrate,
p104
aVand it leads sometimes to very conspiratorial places.
p105
aVSo let's just take one political issue that's pretty hot,
p106
aVaffirmative action.
p107
aVSo depending on your politics, you might think that affirmative action
p108
aVis either a wise or an unwise way to promote diversity in the workplace
p109
aVor the classroom.
p110
aVBut if you grow up in an area like this,
p111
aVyou see affirmative action as a tool to hold people like you back.
p112
aVThat's especially true if you're a member of the white working class.
p113
aVYou see it as something that isn't just about good or bad policy.
p114
aVYou see it as something that's actively conspiring,
p115
aVwhere people with political and financial power
p116
aVare working against you.
p117
aVAnd there are a lot of ways that you see that conspiracy against you \u2014
p118
aVperceived, real, but it's there,
p119
aVand it warps expectations.
p120
aa(lp121
VSo if you think about what do you do when you grow up in that world,
p122
aVyou can respond in a couple of ways.
p123
aVOne, you can say, "I'm not going to work hard,
p124
aVbecause no matter how hard I work, it's not going to matter."
p125
aVAnother thing you might do is say,
p126
aV"Well, I'm not going to go after the traditional markers of success,
p127
aVlike a university education or a prestigious job,
p128
aVbecause the people who care about those things are unlike me.
p129
aVThey're never going to let me in."
p130
aVWhen I got admitted to Yale, a family member asked me
p131
aVif I had pretended to be a liberal to get by the admissions committee.
p132
aVSeriously.
p133
aVAnd it's obviously not the case that there was a liberal box to check
p134
aVon the application,
p135
aVbut it speaks to a very real insecurity in these places
p136
aVthat you have to pretend to be somebody you're not
p137
aVto get past these various social barriers.
p138
aVIt's a very significant problem.
p139
aa(lp140
VEven if you don't give in to that hopelessness,
p141
aVeven if you think, let's say,
p142
aVthat your choices matter and you want to make the good choices,
p143
aVyou want to do better for yourself and for your family,
p144
aVit's sometimes hard to even know what those choices are
p145
aVwhen you grow up in a community like I did.
p146
aVI didn't know, for example,
p147
aVthat you had to go to law school to be a lawyer.
p148
aVI didn't know that elite universities, as research consistently tells us,
p149
aVare cheaper for low-income kids
p150
aVbecause these universities have bigger endowments,
p151
aVcan offer more generous financial aid.
p152
aVI remember I learned this
p153
aVwhen I got the financial aid letter from Yale for myself,
p154
aVtens of thousands of dollars in need-based aid,
p155
aVwhich is a term I had never heard before.
p156
aVBut I turned to my aunt when I got that letter and said,
p157
aV"You know, I think this just means that for the first time in my life,
p158
aVbeing poor has paid really well."
p159
aa(lp160
VSo I didn't have access to that information
p161
aVbecause the social networks around me didn't have access to that information.
p162
aVI learned from my community how to shoot a gun, how to shoot it well.
p163
aVI learned how to make a damn good biscuit recipe.
p164
aVThe trick, by the way, is frozen butter, not warm butter.
p165
aVBut I didn't learn how to get ahead.
p166
aVI didn't learn how to make the good decisions
p167
aVabout education and opportunity
p168
aVthat you need to make
p169
aVto actually have a chance in this 21st century knowledge economy.
p170
aVEconomists call the value that we gain from our informal networks,
p171
aVfrom our friends and colleagues and family "social capital."
p172
aVThe social capital that I had wasn't built for 21st century America,
p173
aVand it showed.
p174
aa(lp175
VThere's something else that's really important that's going on
p176
aVthat our community doesn't like to talk about,
p177
aVbut it's very real.
p178
aVWorking-class kids are much more likely
p179
aVto face what's called adverse childhood experiences,
p180
aVwhich is just a fancy word for childhood trauma:
p181
aVgetting hit or yelled at, put down by a parent repeatedly,
p182
aVwatching someone hit or beat your parent,
p183
aVwatching someone do drugs or abuse alcohol.
p184
aVThese are all instances of childhood trauma,
p185
aVand they're pretty commonplace in my family.
p186
aVImportantly, they're not just commonplace in my family right now.
p187
aVThey're also multigenerational.
p188
aVSo my grandparents,
p189
aVthe very first time that they had kids,
p190
aVthey expected that they were going to raise them in a way
p191
aVthat was uniquely good.
p192
aVThey were middle class,
p193
aVthey were able to earn a good wage in a steel mill.
p194
aVBut what ended up happening
p195
aVis that they exposed their kids to a lot of the childhood trauma
p196
aVthat had gone back many generations.
p197
aVMy mom was 12 when she saw my grandma set my grandfather on fire.
p198
aVHis crime was that he came home drunk
p199
aVafter she told him,
p200
aV"If you come home drunk, I'm gonna kill you."
p201
aVAnd she tried to do it.
p202
aVThink about the way that that affects a child's mind.
p203
aa(lp204
VAnd we think of these things as especially rare,
p205
aVbut a study by the Wisconsin Children's Trust Fund found
p206
aVthat 40 percent of low-income kids face multiple instances of childhood trauma,
p207
aVcompared to only 29 percent for upper-income kids.
p208
aVAnd think about what that really means.
p209
aVIf you're a low-income kid,
p210
aValmost half of you face multiple instances of childhood trauma.
p211
aVThis is not an isolated problem.
p212
aVThis is a very significant issue.
p213
aa(lp214
VWe know what happens to the kids who experience that life.
p215
aVThey're more likely to do drugs, more likely to go to jail,
p216
aVmore likely to drop out of high school,
p217
aVand most importantly,
p218
aVthey're more likely to do to their children
p219
aVwhat their parents did to them.
p220
aVThis trauma, this chaos in the home,
p221
aVis our culture's very worst gift to our children,
p222
aVand it's a gift that keeps on giving.
p223
aa(lp224
VSo you combine all that,
p225
aVthe hopelessness, the despair,
p226
aVthe cynicism about the future,
p227
aVthe childhood trauma,
p228
aVthe low social capital,
p229
aVand you begin to understand why me,
p230
aVat the age of 14,
p231
aVwas ready to become just another statistic,
p232
aVanother kid who failed to beat the odds.
p233
aa(lp234
VBut something unexpected happened.
p235
aVI did beat the odds.
p236
aVThings turned up for me.
p237
aVI graduated from high school, from college, I went to law school,
p238
aVand I have a pretty good job now.
p239
aVSo what happened?
p240
aa(lp241
VWell, one thing that happened is that my grandparents,
p242
aVthe same grandparents of setting someone on fire fame,
p243
aVthey really shaped up by the time I came around.
p244
aVThey provided me a stable home,
p245
aVa stable family.
p246
aVThey made sure
p247
aVthat when my parents weren't able to do the things that kids need,
p248
aVthey stepped in and filled that role.
p249
aVMy grandma especially did two things that really matter.
p250
aVOne, she provided that peaceful home that allowed me to focus on homework
p251
aVand the things that kids should be focused on.
p252
aVBut she was also this incredibly perceptive woman,
p253
aVdespite not even having a middle school education.
p254
aVShe recognized the message that my community had for me,
p255
aVthat my choices didn't matter,
p256
aVthat the deck was stacked against me.
p257
aVShe once told me,
p258
aV"JD, never be like those losers who think the deck is stacked against them.
p259
aVYou can do anything you want to."
p260
aa(lp261
VAnd yet she recognized that life wasn't fair.
p262
aVIt's hard to strike that balance,
p263
aVto tell a kid that life isn't fair,
p264
aVbut also recognize and enforce in them the reality that their choices matter.
p265
aVBut mamaw was able to strike that balance.
p266
aa(lp267
VThe other thing that really helped was the United States Marine Corps.
p268
aVSo we think of the Marine Corps as a military outfit, and of course it is,
p269
aVbut for me, the US Marine Corps was a four-year crash course
p270
aVin character education.
p271
aVIt taught me how to make a bed, how to do laundry,
p272
aVhow to wake up early, how to manage my finances.
p273
aVThese are things my community didn't teach me.
p274
aVI remember when I went to go buy a car for the very first time,
p275
aVI was offered a dealer's low, low interest rate of 21.9 percent,
p276
aVand I was ready to sign on the dotted line.
p277
aVBut I didn't take that deal,
p278
aVbecause I went and took it to my officer
p279
aVwho told me, "Stop being an idiot,
p280
aVgo to the local credit union, and get a better deal."
p281
aVAnd so that's what I did.
p282
aVBut without the Marine Corps,
p283
aVI would have never had access to that knowledge.
p284
aVI would have had a financial calamity, frankly.
p285
aa(lp286
VThe last thing I want to say is that I had a lot of good fortune
p287
aVin the mentors and people
p288
aVwho have played an important role in my life.
p289
aVFrom the Marines, from Ohio State, from Yale,
p290
aVfrom other places,
p291
aVpeople have really stepped in
p292
aVand ensured that they filled that social capital gap
p293
aVthat it was pretty obvious, apparently, that I had.
p294
aVThat comes from good fortune,
p295
aVbut a lot of children aren't going to have that good fortune,
p296
aVand I think that raises really important questions for all of us
p297
aVabout how we're going to change that.
p298
aVWe need to ask questions about how we're going to give low-income kids
p299
aVwho come from a broken home access to a loving home.
p300
aVWe need to ask questions
p301
aVabout how we're going to teach low-income parents
p302
aVhow to better interact with their children,
p303
aVwith their partners.
p304
aVWe need to ask questions about how we give social capital,
p305
aVmentorship to low-income kids who don't have it.
p306
aVWe need to think about how we teach working class children
p307
aVabout not just hard skills,
p308
aVlike reading, mathematics,
p309
aVbut also soft skills,
p310
aVlike conflict resolution and financial management.
p311
aa(lp312
VNow, I don't have all of the answers.
p313
aVI don't know all of the solutions to this problem,
p314
aVbut I do know this:
p315
aVin southern Ohio right now,
p316
aVthere's a kid who is anxiously awaiting their dad,
p317
aVwondering whether, when he comes through the door,
p318
aVhe'll walk calmly or stumble drunkly.
p319
aVThere's a kid
p320
aVwhose mom sticks a needle in her arm
p321
aVand passes out,
p322
aVand he doesn't know why she doesn't cook him dinner,
p323
aVand he goes to bed hungry that night.
p324
aVThere's a kid who has no hope for the future
p325
aVbut desperately wants to live a better life.
p326
aVThey just want somebody to show it to them.
p327
aVI don't have all the answers,
p328
aVbut I know that unless our society starts asking better questions
p329
aVabout why I was so lucky
p330
aVand about how to get that luck to more of our communities
p331
aVand our country's children,
p332
aVwe're going to continue to have a very significant problem.
p333
