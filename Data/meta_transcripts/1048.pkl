VSo the Awesome story:
p4
aVIt begins about 40 years ago,
p5
aVwhen my mom and my dad came to Canada.
p6
aVMy mom left Nairobi, Kenya.
p7
aVMy dad left a small village outside of Amritsar, India.
p8
aVAnd they got here in the late 1960s.
p9
aVThey settled in a shady suburb about an hour east of Toronto,
p10
aVand they settled into a new life.
p11
aVThey saw their first dentist,
p12
aVthey ate their first hamburger,
p13
aVand they had their first kids.
p14
aVMy sister and I
p15
aVgrew up here,
p16
aVand we had quiet, happy childhoods.
p17
aVWe had close family,
p18
aVgood friends, a quiet street.
p19
aVWe grew up taking for granted
p20
aVa lot of the things that my parents couldn't take for granted
p21
aVwhen they grew up \u2014
p22
aVthings like power always on
p23
aVin our houses,
p24
aVthings like schools across the street
p25
aVand hospitals down the road
p26
aVand popsicles in the backyard.
p27
aVWe grew up, and we grew older.
p28
aVI went to high school.
p29
aVI graduated.
p30
aVI moved out of the house, I got a job,
p31
aVI found a girl, I settled down \u2014
p32
aVand I realize it sounds like a bad sitcom or a Cat Stevens' song \u2014
p33
aa(lp34
V(Laughter)
p35
aa(lp36
Vbut life was pretty good.
p37
aVLife was pretty good.
p38
aV2006 was a great year.
p39
aVUnder clear blue skies in July in the wine region of Ontario,
p40
aVI got married,
p41
aVsurrounded by 150 family and friends.
p42
aV2007 was a great year.
p43
aVI graduated from school,
p44
aVand I went on a road trip with two of my closest friends.
p45
aVHere's a picture of me and my friend, Chris,
p46
aVon the coast of the Pacific Ocean.
p47
aVWe actually saw seals out of our car window,
p48
aVand we pulled over to take a quick picture of them
p49
aVand then blocked them with our giant heads.
p50
aV(Laughter)
p51
aVSo you can't actually see them,
p52
aVbut it was breathtaking,
p53
aVbelieve me.
p54
aa(lp55
V(Laughter)
p56
aa(lp57
V2008 and 2009 were a little tougher.
p58
aVI know that they were tougher for a lot of people,
p59
aVnot just me.
p60
aVFirst of all, the news was so heavy.
p61
aVIt's still heavy now, and it was heavy before that,
p62
aVbut when you flipped open a newspaper, when you turned on the TV,
p63
aVit was about ice caps melting,
p64
aVwars going on around the world,
p65
aVearthquakes, hurricanes
p66
aVand an economy that was wobbling on the brink of collapse,
p67
aVand then eventually did collapse,
p68
aVand so many of us losing our homes,
p69
aVor our jobs,
p70
aVor our retirements,
p71
aVor our livelihoods.
p72
aV2008, 2009 were heavy years for me for another reason, too.
p73
aVI was going through a lot of personal problems at the time.
p74
aVMy marriage wasn't going well,
p75
aVand we just were growing further and further apart.
p76
aVOne day my wife came home from work
p77
aVand summoned the courage, through a lot of tears,
p78
aVto have a very honest conversation.
p79
aVAnd she said, "I don't love you anymore,"
p80
aVand it was one of the most painful things I'd ever heard
p81
aVand certainly the most heartbreaking thing I'd ever heard,
p82
aVuntil only a month later,
p83
aVwhen I heard something even more heartbreaking.
p84
aa(lp85
VMy friend Chris, who I just showed you a picture of,
p86
aVhad been battling mental illness for some time.
p87
aVAnd for those of you
p88
aVwhose lives have been touched by mental illness,
p89
aVyou know how challenging it can be.
p90
aVI spoke to him on the phone at 10:30 p.m.
p91
aVon a Sunday night.
p92
aVWe talked about the TV show we watched that evening.
p93
aVAnd Monday morning, I found out that he disappeared.
p94
aVVery sadly, he took his own life.
p95
aVAnd it was a really heavy time.
p96
aa(lp97
VAnd as these dark clouds were circling me,
p98
aVand I was finding it really, really difficult
p99
aVto think of anything good,
p100
aVI said to myself that I really needed a way
p101
aVto focus on the positive somehow.
p102
aVSo I came home from work one night,
p103
aVand I logged onto the computer,
p104
aVand I started up a tiny website
p105
aVcalled 1000awesomethings.com.
p106
aVI was trying to remind myself
p107
aVof the simple, universal, little pleasures that we all love,
p108
aVbut we just don't talk about enough \u2014
p109
aVthings like waiters and waitresses
p110
aVwho bring you free refills without asking,
p111
aVbeing the first table to get called up
p112
aVto the dinner buffet at a wedding,
p113
aVwearing warm underwear from just out of the dryer,
p114
aVor when cashiers open up a new check-out lane at the grocery store
p115
aVand you get to be first in line \u2014
p116
aVeven if you were last at the other line, swoop right in there.
p117
aa(lp118
V(Laughter)
p119
aa(lp120
VAnd slowly over time,
p121
aVI started putting myself in a better mood.
p122
aVI mean, 50,000 blogs
p123
aVare started a day,
p124
aVand so my blog was just one of those 50,000.
p125
aVAnd nobody read it except for my mom.
p126
aVAlthough I should say that my traffic did skyrocket
p127
aVand go up by 100 percent
p128
aVwhen she forwarded it to my dad.
p129
aV(Laughter)
p130
aVAnd then I got excited
p131
aVwhen it started getting tens of hits,
p132
aVand then I started getting excited when it started getting dozens
p133
aVand then hundreds and then thousands
p134
aVand then millions.
p135
aVIt started getting bigger and bigger and bigger.
p136
aVAnd then I got a phone call,
p137
aVand the voice at the other end of the line said,
p138
aV"You've just won the Best Blog In the World award."
p139
aVI was like, that sounds totally fake.
p140
aV(Laughter)
p141
aV(Applause)
p142
aVWhich African country do you want me to wire all my money to?
p143
aV(Laughter)
p144
aVBut it turns out, I jumped on a plane,
p145
aVand I ended up walking a red carpet
p146
aVbetween Sarah Silverman and Jimmy Fallon and Martha Stewart.
p147
aVAnd I went onstage to accept a Webby award for Best Blog.
p148
aVAnd the surprise
p149
aVand just the amazement of that
p150
aVwas only overshadowed by my return to Toronto,
p151
aVwhen, in my inbox,
p152
aV10 literary agents were waiting for me
p153
aVto talk about putting this into a book.
p154
aVFlash-forward to the next year
p155
aVand "The Book of Awesome" has now been
p156
aVnumber one on the bestseller list for 20 straight weeks.
p157
aa(lp158
V(Applause)
p159
aa(lp160
VBut look, I said I wanted to do three things with you today.
p161
aVI said I wanted to tell you the Awesome story,
p162
aVI wanted to share with you the three As of Awesome,
p163
aVand I wanted to leave you with a closing thought.
p164
aVSo let's talk about those three As.
p165
aVOver the last few years,
p166
aVI haven't had that much time to really think.
p167
aVBut lately I have had the opportunity to take a step back
p168
aVand ask myself: "What is it over the last few years
p169
aVthat helped me grow my website,
p170
aVbut also grow myself?"
p171
aVAnd I've summarized those things, for me personally,
p172
aVas three As.
p173
aVThey are Attitude, Awareness
p174
aVand Authenticity.
p175
aVI'd love to just talk about each one briefly.
p176
aa(lp177
VSo Attitude:
p178
aVLook, we're all going to get lumps,
p179
aVand we're all going to get bumps.
p180
aVNone of us can predict the future, but we do know one thing about it
p181
aVand that's that it ain't gonna go according to plan.
p182
aVWe will all have high highs
p183
aVand big days and proud moments
p184
aVof smiles on graduation stages,
p185
aVfather-daughter dances at weddings
p186
aVand healthy babies screeching in the delivery room,
p187
aVbut between those high highs,
p188
aVwe may also have some lumps and some bumps too.
p189
aVIt's sad, and it's not pleasant to talk about,
p190
aVbut your husband might leave you,
p191
aVyour girlfriend could cheat,
p192
aVyour headaches might be more serious than you thought,
p193
aVor your dog could get hit by a car on the street.
p194
aVIt's not a happy thought,
p195
aVbut your kids could get mixed up in gangs
p196
aVor bad scenes.
p197
aVYour mom could get cancer,
p198
aVyour dad could get mean.
p199
aVAnd there are times in life
p200
aVwhen you will be tossed in the well, too,
p201
aVwith twists in your stomach and with holes in your heart,
p202
aVand when that bad news washes over you,
p203
aVand when that pain sponges and soaks in,
p204
aVI just really hope you feel
p205
aVlike you've always got two choices.
p206
aVOne, you can swirl and twirl
p207
aVand gloom and doom forever,
p208
aVor two, you can grieve
p209
aVand then face the future
p210
aVwith newly sober eyes.
p211
aVHaving a great attitude is about choosing option number two,
p212
aVand choosing, no matter how difficult it is,
p213
aVno matter what pain hits you,
p214
aVchoosing to move forward and move on
p215
aVand take baby steps into the future.
p216
aa(lp217
VThe second "A" is Awareness.
p218
aVI love hanging out with three year-olds.
p219
aVI love the way that they see the world,
p220
aVbecause they're seeing the world for the first time.
p221
aVI love the way that they can stare at a bug crossing the sidewalk.
p222
aVI love the way that they'll stare slack-jawed
p223
aVat their first baseball game
p224
aVwith wide eyes and a mitt on their hand,
p225
aVsoaking in the crack of the bat and the crunch of the peanuts
p226
aVand the smell of the hotdogs.
p227
aVI love the way that they'll spend hours picking dandelions in the backyard
p228
aVand putting them into a nice centerpiece
p229
aVfor Thanksgiving dinner.
p230
aVI love the way that they see the world,
p231
aVbecause they're seeing the world
p232
aVfor the first time.
p233
aVHaving a sense of awareness
p234
aVis just about embracing your inner three year-old.
p235
aVBecause you all used to be three years old.
p236
aVThat three-year-old boy is still part of you.
p237
aVThat three-year-old girl is still part of you.
p238
aVThey're in there.
p239
aVAnd being aware is just about remembering
p240
aVthat you saw everything you've seen
p241
aVfor the first time once, too.
p242
aVSo there was a time when it was your first time ever
p243
aVhitting a string of green lights on the way home from work.
p244
aVThere was the first time you walked by the open door of a bakery
p245
aVand smelt the bakery air,
p246
aVor the first time you pulled a 20-dollar bill out of your old jacket pocket
p247
aVand said, "Found money."
p248
aa(lp249
VThe last "A" is Authenticity.
p250
aVAnd for this one, I want to tell you a quick story.
p251
aVLet's go all the way back to 1932
p252
aVwhen, on a peanut farm in Georgia,
p253
aVa little baby boy named Roosevelt Grier was born.
p254
aVRoosevelt Grier, or Rosey Grier, as people used to call him,
p255
aVgrew up and grew into
p256
aVa 300-pound, six-foot-five linebacker in the NFL.
p257
aVHe's number 76 in the picture.
p258
aVHere he is pictured with the "fearsome foursome."
p259
aVThese were four guys on the L.A. Rams in the 1960s
p260
aVyou did not want to go up against.
p261
aVThey were tough football players doing what they love,
p262
aVwhich was crushing skulls
p263
aVand separating shoulders on the football field.
p264
aVBut Rosey Grier also had
p265
aVanother passion.
p266
aVIn his deeply authentic self,
p267
aVhe also loved needlepoint. (Laughter)
p268
aVHe loved knitting.
p269
aVHe said that it calmed him down, it relaxed him,
p270
aVit took away his fear of flying and helped him meet chicks.
p271
aVThat's what he said.
p272
aVI mean, he loved it so much that, after he retired from the NFL,
p273
aVhe started joining clubs.
p274
aVAnd he even put out a book
p275
aVcalled "Rosey Grier's Needlepoint for Men."
p276
aV(Laughter)
p277
aV(Applause)
p278
aVIt's a great cover.
p279
aVIf you notice, he's actually needlepointing his own face.
p280
aa(lp281
V(Laughter)
p282
aa(lp283
VAnd so what I love about this story
p284
aVis that Rosey Grier
p285
aVis just such an authentic person,
p286
aVand that's what authenticity is all about.
p287
aVIt's just about being you and being cool with that.
p288
aVAnd I think when you're authentic,
p289
aVyou end up following your heart,
p290
aVand you put yourself in places
p291
aVand situations and in conversations
p292
aVthat you love and that you enjoy.
p293
aVYou meet people that you like talking to.
p294
aVYou go places you've dreamt about.
p295
aVAnd you end you end up following your heart
p296
aVand feeling very fulfilled.
p297
aVSo those are the three A's.
p298
aa(lp299
VFor the closing thought, I want to take you all the way back
p300
aVto my parents coming to Canada.
p301
aVI don't know what it would feel like
p302
aVcoming to a new country when you're in your mid-20s.
p303
aVI don't know, because I never did it,
p304
aVbut I would imagine that it would take a great attitude.
p305
aVI would imagine that you'd have to be pretty aware of your surroundings
p306
aVand appreciating the small wonders
p307
aVthat you're starting to see in your new world.
p308
aVAnd I think you'd have to be really authentic,
p309
aVyou'd have to be really true to yourself
p310
aVin order to get through what you're being exposed to.
p311
aa(lp312
VI'd like to pause my TEDTalk
p313
aVfor about 10 seconds right now,
p314
aVbecause you don't get many opportunities in life to do something like this,
p315
aVand my parents are sitting in the front row.
p316
aVSo I wanted to ask them to, if they don't mind, stand up.
p317
aVAnd I just wanted to say thank you to you guys.
p318
aa(lp319
V(Applause)
p320
aa(lp321
VWhen I was growing up, my dad used to love telling the story
p322
aVof his first day in Canada.
p323
aVAnd it's a great story, because what happened was
p324
aVhe got off the plane at the Toronto airport,
p325
aVand he was welcomed by a non-profit group,
p326
aVwhich I'm sure someone in this room runs.
p327
aV(Laughter)
p328
aVAnd this non-profit group had a big welcoming lunch
p329
aVfor all the new immigrants to Canada.
p330
aVAnd my dad says he got off the plane and he went to this lunch
p331
aVand there was this huge spread.
p332
aVThere was bread, there was those little, mini dill pickles,
p333
aVthere was olives, those little white onions.
p334
aVThere was rolled up turkey cold cuts,
p335
aVrolled up ham cold cuts, rolled up roast beef cold cuts
p336
aVand little cubes of cheese.
p337
aVThere was tuna salad sandwiches and egg salad sandwiches
p338
aVand salmon salad sandwiches.
p339
aVThere was lasagna, there was casseroles,
p340
aVthere was brownies, there was butter tarts,
p341
aVand there was pies, lots and lots of pies.
p342
aVAnd when my dad tells the story, he says,
p343
aV"The craziest thing was, I'd never seen any of that before, except bread.
p344
aV(Laughter)
p345
aVI didn't know what was meat, what was vegetarian.
p346
aVI was eating olives with pie.
p347
aV(Laughter)
p348
aVI just couldn't believe how many things you can get here."
p349
aa(lp350
V(Laughter)
p351
aa(lp352
VWhen I was five years old,
p353
aVmy dad used to take me grocery shopping,
p354
aVand he would stare in wonder
p355
aVat the little stickers that are on the fruits and vegetables.
p356
aVHe would say, "Look, can you believe they have a mango here from Mexico?
p357
aVThey've got an apple here from South Africa.
p358
aVCan you believe they've got a date from Morocco?"
p359
aVHe's like, "Do you know where Morocco even is?"
p360
aVAnd I'd say, "I'm five. I don't even know where I am.
p361
aVIs this A&P?"
p362
aVAnd he'd say, "I don't know where Morocco is either, but let's find out."
p363
aVAnd so we'd buy the date, and we'd go home.
p364
aVAnd we'd actually take an atlas off the shelf,
p365
aVand we'd flip through until we found this mysterious country.
p366
aVAnd when we did, my dad would say,
p367
aV"Can you believe someone climbed a tree over there,
p368
aVpicked this thing off it, put it in a truck,
p369
aVdrove it all the way to the docks
p370
aVand then sailed it all the way
p371
aVacross the Atlantic Ocean
p372
aVand then put it in another truck
p373
aVand drove that all the way to a tiny grocery store just outside our house,
p374
aVso they could sell it to us for 25 cents?"
p375
aVAnd I'd say, "I don't believe that."
p376
aVAnd he's like, "I don't believe it either.
p377
aVThings are amazing. There's just so many things to be happy about."
p378
aa(lp379
VWhen I stop to think about it, he's absolutely right.
p380
aVThere are so many things to be happy about.
p381
aVWe are the only species
p382
aVon the only life-giving rock
p383
aVin the entire universe that we've ever seen,
p384
aVcapable of experiencing
p385
aVso many of these things.
p386
aVI mean, we're the only ones with architecture and agriculture.
p387
aVWe're the only ones with jewelry and democracy.
p388
aVWe've got airplanes, highway lanes,
p389
aVinterior design and horoscope signs.
p390
aVWe've got fashion magazines, house party scenes.
p391
aVYou can watch a horror movie with monsters.
p392
aVYou can go to a concert and hear guitars jamming.
p393
aVWe've got books, buffets and radio waves,
p394
aVwedding brides and rollercoaster rides.
p395
aVYou can sleep in clean sheets.
p396
aVYou can go to the movies and get good seats.
p397
aVYou can smell bakery air, walk around with rain hair,
p398
aVpop bubble wrap or take an illegal nap.
p399
aa(lp400
VWe've got all that,
p401
aVbut we've only got 100 years to enjoy it.
p402
aVAnd that's the sad part.
p403
aVThe cashiers at your grocery store,
p404
aVthe foreman at your plant,
p405
aVthe guy tailgating you home on the highway,
p406
aVthe telemarketer calling you during dinner,
p407
aVevery teacher you've ever had,
p408
aVeveryone that's ever woken up beside you,
p409
aVevery politician in every country,
p410
aVevery actor in every movie,
p411
aVevery single person in your family, everyone you love,
p412
aVeveryone in this room and you
p413
aVwill be dead in a hundred years.
p414
aVLife is so great that we only get such a short time
p415
aVto experience and enjoy
p416
aVall those tiny little moments that make it so sweet.
p417
aVAnd that moment is right now,
p418
aVand those moments are counting down,
p419
aVand those moments are always, always, always fleeting.
p420
aa(lp421
VYou will never be as young as you are right now.
p422
aVAnd that's why I believe that if you live your life
p423
aVwith a great attitude,
p424
aVchoosing to move forward and move on
p425
aVwhenever life deals you a blow,
p426
aVliving with a sense of awareness of the world around you,
p427
aVembracing your inner three year-old
p428
aVand seeing the tiny joys that make life so sweet
p429
aVand being authentic to yourself,
p430
aVbeing you and being cool with that,
p431
aVletting your heart lead you and putting yourself in experiences that satisfy you,
p432
aVthen I think you'll live a life
p433
aVthat is rich and is satisfying,
p434
aVand I think you'll live a life that is truly awesome.
p435
aa(lp436
