VOver the last 13 years \u2014
p4
aVone, three, 13 years \u2014
p5
aVI've been part of an exceptional team at InSightec in Israel
p6
aVand partners around the world
p7
aVfor taking this idea, this concept,
p8
aVnoninvasive surgery,
p9
aVfrom the research lab to routine clinical use.
p10
aVAnd this is what I'll tell you about.
p11
aV13 years \u2014
p12
aVfor some of you, you can empathize with that number.
p13
aVFor me, today, on this date,
p14
aVit's like a second bar mitzvah experience.
p15
aa(lp16
V(Laughter)
p17
aa(lp18
VSo this dream
p19
aVis really enabled
p20
aVby the convergence
p21
aVof two known technologies.
p22
aVOne is the focused ultrasound,
p23
aVand the other one is the
p24
aVvision-enabled magnetic resonance imaging.
p25
aVSo let's first talk about focused ultrasound.
p26
aVAnd I hold in my hand
p27
aVa tissue-mimicking phantom.
p28
aVIt is made out of silicon.
p29
aVIt is transparent, made just for you.
p30
aVSo you see, it's all intact,
p31
aVcompletely transparent.
p32
aVI'll take you now to the acoustic lab.
p33
aVYou see the phantom within the aquarium.
p34
aVThis is a setup I put in a physics lab.
p35
aVOn the right-hand side,
p36
aVyou see an ultrasonic transducer.
p37
aVSo the ultrasonic transducer
p38
aVemits basically an ultrasonic beam
p39
aVthat focuses inside the phantom.
p40
aVOkay, when you hear the click,
p41
aVthis is when the energy starts to emit
p42
aVand you see a little lesion form
p43
aVinside the phantom.
p44
aVOkay, so everything around it
p45
aVis whole and intact.
p46
aVIt's just a lesion formed inside.
p47
aVSo think about, this is in your brain.
p48
aVWe need to reach a target inside the brain.
p49
aVWe can do it without harming any tissue.
p50
aVSo this is, I think,
p51
aVthe first kosher Hippocratic surgical system.
p52
aa(lp53
V(Laughter)
p54
aa(lp55
VOkay, so let's talk a little bit about ultrasound,
p56
aVthe force of ultrasound.
p57
aVYou know all about imaging, right, ultrasound imaging.
p58
aVAnd you know also about lithotripsy \u2014
p59
aVbreaking kidney stones.
p60
aVBut ultrasound can be shaped
p61
aVto be anything in between,
p62
aVbecause it's a mechanical force.
p63
aVBasically, it's a force acting on a tissue
p64
aVthat it transverses.
p65
aVSo you can change the intensity, the frequency,
p66
aVthe duration, the pulse shape of the ultrasound
p67
aVto create anything
p68
aVfrom an airbrush to a hammer.
p69
aVAnd I am going to show you
p70
aVmultiple applications in the medical field
p71
aVthat can be enabled
p72
aVjust by focusing,
p73
aVphysically focusing.
p74
aa(lp75
VSo this idea
p76
aVof harnessing focused ultrasound to treat lesions in the brain
p77
aVis not new at all.
p78
aVWhen I was born, this idea was already conceived
p79
aVby pioneers such as the Fry brothers
p80
aVand Lars Leksell,
p81
aVwho is know actually
p82
aVas the inventor of the gammaknife.
p83
aVBut you may not know
p84
aVthat he tried to perform lobotomies in the brain,
p85
aVnoninvasively,
p86
aVwith focused ultrasound in the '50s.
p87
aVHe failed,
p88
aVso he then invented the gammaknife.
p89
aVAnd it makes you ponder
p90
aVwhy those pioneers failed.
p91
aVAnd there was something fundamental
p92
aVthat they were missing.
p93
aVThey were missing the vision.
p94
aVIt wasn't until the invention of the MR
p95
aVand really the integration of MR
p96
aVwith focused ultrasound
p97
aVthat we could get the feedback \u2014
p98
aVboth the anatomical and the physiological
p99
aVin order to have a completely noninvasive, closed-loop
p100
aVsurgical procedure.
p101
aa(lp102
VSo this is how it looks, you know,
p103
aVthe operating room of the future today.
p104
aVThis is an MR suite with a focused ultrasound system.
p105
aVAnd I will give you several examples.
p106
aVSo the first one is in the brain.
p107
aVOne of the neurological conditions
p108
aVthat can be treated with focused ultrasound
p109
aVare movement disorders,
p110
aVlike Parkinson's or essential tremor.
p111
aVWhat is typical to those conditions,
p112
aVto essential tremor for example,
p113
aVis inability
p114
aVto drink or eat cereal or soup
p115
aVwithout spilling everything all over you,
p116
aVor write legibly so people can understand it,
p117
aVand be really independent in your life
p118
aVwithout the help of others.
p119
aa(lp120
VSo I'd like you to meet John.
p121
aVJohn is a retired professor of history
p122
aVfrom Virginia.
p123
aVSo he suffered from essential tremor for many years.
p124
aVAnd medication didn't help him anymore.
p125
aVAnd many of those patients refused to undergo surgery
p126
aVto have people cut into their brain.
p127
aVAnd about four or five months ago,
p128
aVhe underwent an experimental procedure.
p129
aVIt is approved under an FDAIDE
p130
aVat the University of Virginia
p131
aVin Charlottesville
p132
aVusing focused ultrasound
p133
aVto ablate a point in his thalamus.
p134
aVAnd this is his handwriting.
p135
aV"On June 20th," if you can read it,
p136
aV"2011."
p137
aVThis is his handwriting
p138
aVon the morning of the treatment
p139
aVbefore going into the MR
p140
aVSo now I'll take you through
p141
aV[what] a typical procedure like that looks like,
p142
aV[what] noninvasive surgery looks like.
p143
aa(lp144
VSo we put the patient on the MR table.
p145
aVWe attach a transducer, in this case, to the brain,
p146
aVbut if it will be a different organ,
p147
aVit will be a different transducer attached to the patient.
p148
aVAnd the physician
p149
aVwill then take a regular MR scan.
p150
aVAnd the objective of that?
p151
aVI don't have a pointer here,
p152
aVbut you see the green, sort of rectangle or trapezoid?
p153
aVThis is the sort of general area of the treatment.
p154
aVIt's a safety boundary
p155
aVaround the target.
p156
aVIt's a target in the thalamus.
p157
aVSo once those pictures are acquired
p158
aVand the physician has drawn
p159
aVall the necessary safety limits and so on,
p160
aVhe selects basically a point \u2014
p161
aVyou see the round point in the middle where the cursor is \u2014
p162
aVand he presses this blue button called "sonicate."
p163
aVWe call this instance of injecting the energy,
p164
aVwe call it sonication.
p165
aVThe only handwork the physician does here
p166
aVis moving a mouse.
p167
aVThis is the only device he needs in this treatment.
p168
aa(lp169
VSo he presses "sonicate," and this is what happens.
p170
aVYou see the transducer, the light blue.
p171
aVThere's water in between the skull and the transducer.
p172
aVAnd it does this burst of energy.
p173
aVIt elevates the temperature.
p174
aVWe first need to verify
p175
aVthat we are on target.
p176
aVSo the first sonication
p177
aVis at lower energy.
p178
aVIt doesn't do any damage,
p179
aVbut it elevates the temperature
p180
aVby a few degrees.
p181
aVAnd one of the unique capabilities
p182
aVthat we leverage with the MR
p183
aVis the ability to measure temperature noninvasively.
p184
aVThis is really a unique capability of the MR.
p185
aVIt is not being used
p186
aVin regular diagnostic imaging.
p187
aVBut here we can get
p188
aVboth the anatomical imaging and the temperature maps in real time.
p189
aVAnd you can see the points there on the graph.
p190
aVThe temperature was raised
p191
aVto 43 degrees C temporarily.
p192
aVThis doesn't cause any damage.
p193
aVBut the point is we are right on target.
p194
aVSo once the physician verifies
p195
aVthat the focus spot is on the target he has chosen,
p196
aVthen we move to perform
p197
aVa full-energy ablation
p198
aVlike you see here.
p199
aVAnd you see the temperature rises
p200
aVto like 55 to 60 degrees C.
p201
aVIf you do it for more than a second,
p202
aVit's enough to basically destroy
p203
aVthe proteins of the cells.
p204
aa(lp205
VThis is the outcome from a patient perspective \u2014
p206
aVsame day after the treatment.
p207
aVThis is an immediate relief.
p208
aV(Applause)
p209
aVThank you.
p210
aVJohn is one of [about] a dozen
p211
aVvery heroic, courageous people
p212
aVwho volunteered for the study.
p213
aVAnd you have to understand
p214
aVwhat is in people's mind
p215
aVwhen they are willing to take the risk.
p216
aVAnd this is a quote from John after he wrote it.
p217
aVHe said, "Miraculous."
p218
aVAnd his wife said, "This is the happiest moment of my life."
p219
aVAnd you wonder why.
p220
aVI mean, one of the messages I like to carry over
p221
aVis, what about defending quality of life?
p222
aVI mean, those people lose their independence.
p223
aVThey are dependent on others.
p224
aVAnd John today is fully independent.
p225
aVHe returned to a normal life routine.
p226
aVAnd he also plays golf,
p227
aVlike you do in Virginia
p228
aVwhen you are retired.
p229
aVOkay, so you can see here the spot.
p230
aVIt's like three millimeters in the middle of the brain.
p231
aVThere's no damage outside.
p232
aVHe suffers from no neurodeficit.
p233
aVThere's no recovery needed, no nothing.
p234
aVHe's back to his normal life.
p235
aa(lp236
VLet's move now
p237
aVto a more painful subject.
p238
aVPain is something
p239
aVthat can make your life miserable.
p240
aVAnd people are suffering from all kinds of pain
p241
aVlike neuropathic pain, lower-back pain
p242
aVand cancer pain from bone metastases,
p243
aVwhen the metastases get to your bones,
p244
aVsometimes they are very painful.
p245
aVAll those I've indicated
p246
aVhave already been shown
p247
aVto be successfully treated
p248
aVby focused ultrasound
p249
aVrelieving the pain, again, very fast.
p250
aVAnd I would like to tell you
p251
aVabout PJ.
p252
aVHe's a 78 year-old farmer
p253
aVwho suffered from \u2014 how should I say it? \u2014
p254
aVit's called pain in the butt.
p255
aVHe had metastases in his right buttock,
p256
aVand he couldn't sit
p257
aVeven with medication.
p258
aVHe had to forgo all the farm activities.
p259
aVHe was treated with radiation therapy,
p260
aVstate-of-the-art radiation therapy,
p261
aVbut it didn't help.
p262
aVMany patients like that favor radiation therapy.
p263
aa(lp264
VAnd again, he volunteered
p265
aVto a pivotal study
p266
aVthat we ran worldwide,
p267
aValso in the U.S.
p268
aVAnd his wife actually took him.
p269
aVThey drove like three hours
p270
aVfrom their farm to the hospital.
p271
aVHe had to sit on a cushion,
p272
aVstand still, not move,
p273
aVbecause it was very painful.
p274
aVHe took the treatment,
p275
aVand on the way back,
p276
aVhe drove the truck by himself.
p277
aVSo again, this is an immediate relief.
p278
aVAnd you have to understand
p279
aVwhat those people feel
p280
aVand what their family experiences
p281
aVwhen it happens.
p282
aVHe returned again
p283
aVto his daily routine on the farm.
p284
aVHe rides his tractor.
p285
aVHe rides his horse to their mountain cabin regularly.
p286
aVAnd he has been very happy.
p287
aa(lp288
VBut now, you ask me,
p289
aVbut what about war, the war on cancer?
p290
aVShow us some primary cancer.
p291
aVWhat can be done there?
p292
aVSo I have good news and bad news.
p293
aVThe good news: there's a lot that can be done.
p294
aVAnd it has been shown actually outside of the U.S.
p295
aVAnd doing that in the U.S.
p296
aVis very painful.
p297
aVI don't see, without this nation
p298
aVtaking it as some collective will
p299
aVor something that is a national goal to make that happen,
p300
aVit will not happen.
p301
aVAnd it's not just because of regulation;
p302
aVit's because of the amount of money needed
p303
aVunder the current evidence-based medicine
p304
aVand the size of trials and so on
p305
aVto make it happen.
p306
aa(lp307
VSo the first two applications
p308
aVare breast cancer and prostate cancer.
p309
aVThey were the first to be treated by focused ultrasound.
p310
aVAnd we have better-than-surgery results in breasts.
p311
aVBut I have a message for the men here.
p312
aVWe heard here yesterday Quyen
p313
aVtalking about the adverse event trait
p314
aVin prostate cancer.
p315
aVThere is a unique opportunity now
p316
aVwith focused ultrasound guided by MR,
p317
aVbecause we can actually think about
p318
aVprostate lumpectomy \u2014
p319
aVtreating just the focal lesion
p320
aVand not removing the whole gland,
p321
aVand by that, avoiding all the issues
p322
aVwith potency and incontinence.
p323
aVWell, there are other cancer tumors in the abdomen \u2014
p324
aVquite lethal, very lethal actually \u2014
p325
aVpancreas, liver, kidney.
p326
aVThe challenge there
p327
aVwith a breathing and awake patient \u2014
p328
aVand in all our treatments,
p329
aVthe patient is awake and conscious
p330
aVand speaks with the physician \u2014
p331
aVis you have to teach the MR some tricks
p332
aVhow to do it in real time.
p333
aVAnd this will take time.
p334
aVThis will take two years.
p335
aa(lp336
VBut I have now a message to the ladies.
p337
aVAnd this is, in 2004,
p338
aVthe FDA has approved MR-guided focused ultrasounds
p339
aVfor the treatment of symptomatic uterine fibroids.
p340
aVWomen suffer from that disease.
p341
aVAll those tumors
p342
aVhave heavy bleeding during periods,
p343
aVabdominal pressure, back pain,
p344
aVfrequent urination.
p345
aVAnd sometimes, they cannot even conceive and become pregnant
p346
aVbecause of the fibroid.
p347
aVThis is Frances.
p348
aVShe was diagnosed with a grapefruit-sized fibroid.
p349
aVThis is a big fibroid.
p350
aVShe was offered a hysterectomy,
p351
aVbut this is an inconceivable proposition
p352
aVfor someone who wants to keep her pregnancy option.
p353
aVSo she elected to undergo a focused ultrasound procedure
p354
aVin 2008.
p355
aVAnd in 2010, she became a first-time mother to a healthy baby.
p356
aVSo new life was born.
p357
aa(lp358
V(Applause)
p359
aa(lp360
VSo in conclusion,
p361
aVI'd like to leave you with actually four messages.
p362
aVOne is, think about the amount
p363
aVof suffering that is saved
p364
aVfrom patients undergoing noninvasive surgery,
p365
aVand also the economical and emotional burden
p366
aVremoved from their families and communities
p367
aVand the society at large \u2014
p368
aVand I think also from their physicians, by the way.
p369
aVAnd the other thing I would like you to think about
p370
aVis the new type of relationship
p371
aVbetween physician and patients
p372
aVwhen you have a patient on the table
p373
aV[who] is awake and can even monitor the treatment.
p374
aVIn all our treatments,
p375
aVthe patient holds a stop sonication button.
p376
aVHe can stop the surgery at any moment.
p377
aa(lp378
VAnd with that note,
p379
aVI would like to thank you for listening.
