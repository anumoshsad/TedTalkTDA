VI want to talk to you
p4
aVabout one of the biggest myths in medicine,
p5
aVand that is the idea
p6
aVthat all we need are more medical breakthroughs
p7
aVand then all of our problems will be solved.
p8
aVOur society loves to romanticize
p9
aVthe idea of the single, solo inventor
p10
aVwho, working late in the lab one night,
p11
aVmakes an earthshaking discovery,
p12
aVand voila, overnight everything's changed.
p13
aVThat's a very appealing picture,
p14
aVhowever, it's just not true.
p15
aVIn fact, medicine today is a team sport.
p16
aVAnd in many ways,
p17
aVit always has been.
p18
aVI'd like to share with you a story
p19
aVabout how I've experienced this very dramatically
p20
aVin my own work.
p21
aa(lp22
VI'm a surgeon,
p23
aVand we surgeons have always had
p24
aVthis special relationship with light.
p25
aVWhen I make an incision inside a patient's body, it's dark.
p26
aVWe need to shine light to see what we're doing.
p27
aVAnd this is why, traditionally,
p28
aVsurgeries have always started so early in the morning \u2014
p29
aVto take advantage of daylight hours.
p30
aVAnd if you look at historical pictures
p31
aVof the early operating rooms,
p32
aVthey have been on top of buildings.
p33
aVFor example, this is the oldest operating room in the Western world,
p34
aVin London,
p35
aVwhere the operating room
p36
aVis actually on top of a church
p37
aVwith a skylight coming in.
p38
aVAnd then this is a picture
p39
aVof one of the most famous hospitals in America.
p40
aVThis is Mass General in Boston.
p41
aVAnd do you know where the operating room is?
p42
aVHere it is
p43
aVon the top of the building
p44
aVwith plenty of windows to let light in.
p45
aa(lp46
VSo nowadays in the operating room,
p47
aVwe no longer need to use sunlight.
p48
aVAnd because we no longer need to use sunlight,
p49
aVwe have very specialized lights
p50
aVthat are made for the operating room.
p51
aVWe have an opportunity
p52
aVto bring in other kinds of lights \u2014
p53
aVlights that can allow us to see
p54
aVwhat we currently don't see.
p55
aVAnd this is what I think
p56
aVis the magic of fluorescence.
p57
aa(lp58
VSo let me back up a little bit.
p59
aVWhen we are in medical school,
p60
aVwe learn our anatomy from illustrations such as this
p61
aVwhere everything's color-coded.
p62
aVNerves are yellow, arteries are red,
p63
aVveins are blue.
p64
aVThat's so easy anybody could become a surgeon, right?
p65
aVHowever, when we have a real patient on the table,
p66
aVthis is the same neck dissection \u2014
p67
aVnot so easy to tell the difference
p68
aVbetween different structures.
p69
aVWe heard over the last couple days
p70
aVwhat an urgent problem
p71
aVcancer still is in our society,
p72
aVwhat a pressing need it is
p73
aVfor us to not have
p74
aVone person die every minute.
p75
aVWell if cancer can be caught early,
p76
aVenough such that someone can have their cancer taken out,
p77
aVexcised with surgery,
p78
aVI don't care if it has this gene or that gene,
p79
aVor if it has this protein or that protein,
p80
aVit's in the jar.
p81
aVIt's done, it's out, you're cured of cancer.
p82
aa(lp83
VThis is how we excise cancers.
p84
aVWe do our best, based upon our training
p85
aVand the way the cancer looks and the way it feels
p86
aVand its relationship to other structures and all of our experience,
p87
aVwe say, you know what, the cancer's gone.
p88
aVWe've made a good job. We've taken it out.
p89
aVThat's what the surgeon is saying in the operating room
p90
aVwhen the patient's on the table.
p91
aVBut then we actually don't know that it's all out.
p92
aVWe actually have to take samples from the surgical bed,
p93
aVwhat's left behind in the patient,
p94
aVand then send those bits to the pathology lab.
p95
aVIn the meanwhile, the patient's on the operating room table.
p96
aVThe nurses, anesthesiologist, the surgeon,
p97
aVall the assistants are waiting around.
p98
aVAnd we wait.
p99
aVThe pathologist takes that sample,
p100
aVfreezes it, cuts it, looks in the microscope one by one
p101
aVand then calls back into the room.
p102
aVAnd that may be 20 minutes later per piece.
p103
aVSo if you've sent three specimens,
p104
aVit's an hour later.
p105
aVAnd very often they say,
p106
aV"You know what, points A and B are okay,
p107
aVbut point C, you still have some residual cancer there.
p108
aVPlease go cut that piece out."
p109
aVSo we go back and we do that again, and again.
p110
aa(lp111
VAnd this whole process:
p112
aV"Okay you're done.
p113
aVWe think the entire tumor is out."
p114
aVBut very often several days later,
p115
aVthe patient's gone home,
p116
aVwe get a phone call:
p117
aV"I'm sorry,
p118
aVonce we looked at the final pathology,
p119
aVonce we looked at the final specimen,
p120
aVwe actually found that there's a couple other spots
p121
aVwhere the margins are positive.
p122
aVThere's still cancer in your patient."
p123
aVSo now you're faced with telling your patient, first of all,
p124
aVthat they may need another surgery,
p125
aVor that they need additional therapy
p126
aVsuch as radiation or chemotherapy.
p127
aVSo wouldn't it be better
p128
aVif we could really tell,
p129
aVif the surgeon could really tell,
p130
aVwhether or not there's still cancer on the surgical field?
p131
aVI mean, in many ways, the way that we're doing it,
p132
aVwe're still operating in the dark.
p133
aa(lp134
VSo in 2004, during my surgical residency,
p135
aVI had the great fortune
p136
aVto meet Dr. Roger Tsien,
p137
aVwho went on to win the Nobel Prize for chemistry
p138
aVin 2008.
p139
aVRoger and his team
p140
aVwere working on a way to detect cancer,
p141
aVand they had a very clever molecule
p142
aVthat they had come up with.
p143
aVThe molecule they had developed
p144
aVhad three parts.
p145
aVThe main part of it is the blue part, polycation,
p146
aVand it's basically very sticky
p147
aVto every tissue in your body.
p148
aa(lp149
VSo imagine that you make a solution
p150
aVfull of this sticky material
p151
aVand inject it into the veins of someone who has cancer,
p152
aVeverything's going to get lit up.
p153
aVNothing will be specific.
p154
aVThere's no specificity there.
p155
aVSo they added two additional components.
p156
aVThe first one is a polyanionic segment,
p157
aVwhich basically acts as a non-stick backing
p158
aVlike the back of a sticker.
p159
aVSo when those two are together, the molecule is neutral
p160
aVand nothing gets stuck down.
p161
aVAnd the two pieces are then linked
p162
aVby something that can only be cut
p163
aVif you have the right molecular scissors \u2014
p164
aVfor example, the kind of protease enzymes
p165
aVthat tumors make.
p166
aVSo here in this situation,
p167
aVif you make a solution full of this three-part molecule
p168
aValong with the dye, which is shown in green,
p169
aVand you inject it into the vein
p170
aVof someone who has cancer,
p171
aVnormal tissue can't cut it.
p172
aVThe molecule passes through and gets excreted.
p173
aVHowever, in the presence of the tumor,
p174
aVnow there are molecular scissors
p175
aVthat can break this molecule apart
p176
aVright there at the cleavable site.
p177
aVAnd now, boom,
p178
aVthe tumor labels itself
p179
aVand it gets fluorescent.
p180
aa(lp181
VSo here's an example of a nerve
p182
aVthat has tumor surrounding it.
p183
aVCan you tell where the tumor is?
p184
aVI couldn't when I was working on this.
p185
aVBut here it is. It's fluorescent.
p186
aVNow it's green.
p187
aVSee, so every single one in the audience
p188
aVnow can tell where the cancer is.
p189
aVWe can tell in the operating room, in the field,
p190
aVat a molecular level,
p191
aVwhere is the cancer and what the surgeon needs to do
p192
aVand how much more work they need to do
p193
aVto cut that out.
p194
aVAnd the cool thing about fluorescence
p195
aVis that it's not only bright,
p196
aVit actually can shine through tissue.
p197
aVThe light that the fluorescence emits
p198
aVcan go through tissue.
p199
aVSo even if the tumor is not right on the surface,
p200
aVyou'll still be able to see it.
p201
aa(lp202
VIn this movie, you can see
p203
aVthat the tumor is green.
p204
aVThere's actually normal muscle on top of it. See that?
p205
aVAnd I'm peeling that muscle away.
p206
aVBut even before I peel that muscle away,
p207
aVyou saw that there was a tumor underneath.
p208
aVSo that's the beauty of having a tumor
p209
aVthat's labeled with fluorescent molecules.
p210
aVThat you can, not only see the margins
p211
aVright there on a molecular level,
p212
aVbut you can see it even if it's not right on the top \u2014
p213
aVeven if it's beyond your field of view.
p214
aVAnd this works for metastatic lymph nodes also.
p215
aa(lp216
VSentinel lymph node dissection
p217
aVhas really changed the way that we manage breast cancer, melanoma.
p218
aVWomen used to get
p219
aVreally debilitating surgeries
p220
aVto excise all of the axillary lymph nodes.
p221
aVBut when sentinel lymph node
p222
aVcame into our treatment protocol,
p223
aVthe surgeon basically looks for the single node
p224
aVthat is the first draining lymph node of the cancer.
p225
aVAnd then if that node has cancer,
p226
aVthe woman would go on to get
p227
aVthe axillary lymph node dissection.
p228
aVSo what that means
p229
aVis if the lymph node did not have cancer,
p230
aVthe woman would be saved
p231
aVfrom having unnecessary surgery.
p232
aa(lp233
VBut sentinel lymph node, the way that we do it today,
p234
aVis kind of like having a road map
p235
aVjust to know where to go.
p236
aVSo if you're driving on the freeway
p237
aVand you want to know where's the next gas station,
p238
aVyou have a map to tell you that that gas station is down the road.
p239
aVIt doesn't tell you whether or not
p240
aVthe gas station has gas.
p241
aVYou have to cut it out, bring it back home,
p242
aVcut it up, look inside
p243
aVand say, "Oh yes, it does have gas."
p244
aVSo that takes more time.
p245
aVPatients are still on the operating room table.
p246
aVAnesthesiologists, surgeons are waiting around.
p247
aVThat takes time.
p248
aa(lp249
VSo with our technology, we can tell right away.
p250
aVYou see a lot of little, roundish bumps there.
p251
aVSome of these are swollen lymph nodes
p252
aVthat look a little larger than others.
p253
aVWho amongst us hasn't had swollen lymph nodes with a cold?
p254
aVThat doesn't mean that there's cancer inside.
p255
aVWell with our technology,
p256
aVthe surgeon is able to tell immediately
p257
aVwhich nodes have cancer.
p258
aVI won't go into this very much,
p259
aVbut our technology, besides being able
p260
aVto tag tumor and metastatic lymph nodes with fluorescence,
p261
aVwe can also use the same smart three-part molecule
p262
aVto tag gadolinium onto the system
p263
aVso you can do this noninvasively.
p264
aVThe patient has cancer,
p265
aVyou want to know if the lymph nodes have cancer
p266
aVeven before you go in.
p267
aVWell you can see this on an MRI.
p268
aa(lp269
VSo in surgery,
p270
aVit's important to know what to cut out.
p271
aVBut equally important
p272
aVis to preserve things
p273
aVthat are important for function.
p274
aVSo it's very important to avoid inadvertent injury.
p275
aVAnd what I'm talking about
p276
aVare nerves.
p277
aVNerves, if they are injured,
p278
aVcan cause paralysis,
p279
aVcan cause pain.
p280
aVIn the setting of prostate cancer,
p281
aVup to 60 percent of men
p282
aVafter prostate cancer surgery
p283
aVmay have urinary incontinence
p284
aVand erectile disfunction.
p285
aVThat's a lot of people to have a lot of problems \u2014
p286
aVand this is even in
p287
aVso-called nerve-sparing surgery,
p288
aVwhich means that the surgeon is aware of the problem,
p289
aVand they are trying to avoid the nerves.
p290
aa(lp291
VBut you know what, these little nerves are so small,
p292
aVin the context of prostate cancer,
p293
aVthat they are actually never seen.
p294
aVThey are traced
p295
aVjust by their known anatomical path
p296
aValong vasculature.
p297
aVAnd they're known because somebody has decided to study them,
p298
aVwhich means that we're still learning
p299
aVabout where they are.
p300
aVCrazy to think that we're having surgery,
p301
aVwe're trying to excise cancer, we don't know where the cancer is.
p302
aVWe're trying to preserve nerves; we can't see where they are.
p303
aa(lp304
VSo I said, wouldn't it be great
p305
aVif we could find a way
p306
aVto see nerves with fluorescence?
p307
aVAnd at first this didn't get a lot of support.
p308
aVPeople said, "We've been doing it this way for all these years.
p309
aVWhat's the problem?
p310
aVWe haven't had that many complications."
p311
aVBut I went ahead anyway.
p312
aVAnd Roger helped me.
p313
aVAnd he brought his whole team with him.
p314
aVSo there's that teamwork thing again.
p315
aVAnd we eventually discovered molecules
p316
aVthat were specifically labeling nerves.
p317
aVAnd when we made a solution of this,
p318
aVtagged with the fluorescence
p319
aVand injected in the body of a mouse,
p320
aVtheir nerves literally glowed.
p321
aVYou can see where they are.
p322
aa(lp323
VHere you're looking at a sciatic nerve of a mouse,
p324
aVand you can see that that big, fat portion you can see very easily.
p325
aVBut in fact, at the tip of that where I'm dissecting now,
p326
aVthere's actually very fine arborizations
p327
aVthat can't really be seen.
p328
aVYou see what looks like little Medusa heads coming out.
p329
aVWe have been able to see nerves
p330
aVfor facial expression, for facial movement, for breathing \u2014
p331
aVevery single nerve \u2014
p332
aVnerves for urinary function around the prostate.
p333
aVWe've been able to see every single nerve.
p334
aVWhen we put these two probes together ...
p335
aVSo here's a tumor.
p336
aVDo you guys know where the margins of this tumor is?
p337
aVNow you do.
p338
aVWhat about the nerve that's going into this tumor?
p339
aVThat white portion there is easy to see.
p340
aVBut what about the part that goes into the tumor?
p341
aVDo you know where it's going?
p342
aVNow you do.
p343
aa(lp344
VBasically, we've come up with a way
p345
aVto stain tissue
p346
aVand color-code the surgical field.
p347
aVThis was a bit of a breakthrough.
p348
aVI think that it'll change the way that we do surgery.
p349
aVWe published our results
p350
aVin the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
p351
aVand in Nature Biotechnology.
p352
aVWe received commentary in Discover magazine,
p353
aVin The Economist.
p354
aVAnd we showed it to a lot of my surgical colleagues.
p355
aVThey said, "Wow!
p356
aVI have patients
p357
aVwho would benefit from this.
p358
aVI think that this will result in my surgeries
p359
aVwith a better outcome
p360
aVand fewer complications."
p361
aa(lp362
VWhat needs to happen now
p363
aVis further development of our technology
p364
aValong with development
p365
aVof the instrumentation
p366
aVthat allows us to see
p367
aVthis sort of fluorescence in the operating room.
p368
aVThe eventual goal
p369
aVis that we'll get this into patients.
p370
aVHowever, we've discovered
p371
aVthat there's actually no straightforward mechanism
p372
aVto develop a molecule
p373
aVfor one-time use.
p374
aVUnderstandably, the majority of the medical industry
p375
aVis focused on multiple-use drugs,
p376
aVsuch as long-term daily medications.
p377
aVWe are focused on making this technology better.
p378
aVWe're focused on adding drugs,
p379
aVadding growth factors,
p380
aVkilling nerves that are causing problems
p381
aVand not the surrounding tissue.
p382
aVWe know that this can be done and we're committed to doing it.
p383
aa(lp384
VI'd like to leave you with this final thought.
p385
aVSuccessful innovation
p386
aVis not a single breakthrough.
p387
aVIt is not a sprint.
p388
aVIt is not an event for the solo runner.
p389
aVSuccessful innovation
p390
aVis a team sport, it's a relay race.
p391
aVIt requires one team for the breakthrough
p392
aVand another team
p393
aVto get the breakthrough accepted and adopted.
p394
aVAnd this takes the long-term steady courage
p395
aVof the day-in day-out struggle
p396
aVto educate, to persuade
p397
aVand to win acceptance.
p398
aVAnd that is the light that I want to shine
p399
aVon health and medicine today.
p400
aa(lp401
