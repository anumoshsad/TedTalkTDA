VIn my lab, we build autonomous aerial robots
p4
aVlike the one you see flying here.
p5
aVUnlike the commercially available drones that you can buy today,
p6
aVthis robot doesn't have any GPS on board.
p7
aVSo without GPS,
p8
aVit's hard for robots like this to determine their position.
p9
aVThis robot uses onboard sensors, cameras and laser scanners,
p10
aVto scan the environment.
p11
aVIt detects features from the environment,
p12
aVand it determines where it is relative to those features,
p13
aVusing a method of triangulation.
p14
aVAnd then it can assemble all these features into a map,
p15
aVlike you see behind me.
p16
aVAnd this map then allows the robot to understand where the obstacles are
p17
aVand navigate in a collision-free manner.
p18
aa(lp19
VWhat I want to show you next
p20
aVis a set of experiments we did inside our laboratory,
p21
aVwhere this robot was able to go for longer distances.
p22
aVSo here you'll see, on the top right, what the robot sees with the camera.
p23
aVAnd on the main screen \u2014
p24
aVand of course this is sped up by a factor of four \u2014
p25
aVon the main screen you'll see the map that it's building.
p26
aVSo this is a high-resolution map of the corridor around our laboratory.
p27
aVAnd in a minute you'll see it enter our lab,
p28
aVwhich is recognizable by the clutter that you see.
p29
aa(lp30
V(Laughter)
p31
aa(lp32
VBut the main point I want to convey to you
p33
aVis that these robots are capable of building high-resolution maps
p34
aVat five centimeters resolution,
p35
aVallowing somebody who is outside the lab, or outside the building
p36
aVto deploy these without actually going inside,
p37
aVand trying to infer what happens inside the building.
p38
aa(lp39
VNow there's one problem with robots like this.
p40
aVThe first problem is it's pretty big.
p41
aVBecause it's big, it's heavy.
p42
aVAnd these robots consume about 100 watts per pound.
p43
aVAnd this makes for a very short mission life.
p44
aVThe second problem
p45
aVis that these robots have onboard sensors that end up being very expensive \u2014
p46
aVa laser scanner, a camera and the processors.
p47
aVThat drives up the cost of this robot.
p48
aa(lp49
VSo we asked ourselves a question:
p50
aVwhat consumer product can you buy in an electronics store
p51
aVthat is inexpensive, that's lightweight, that has sensing onboard and computation?
p52
aVAnd we invented the flying phone.
p53
aa(lp54
V(Laughter)
p55
aa(lp56
VSo this robot uses a Samsung Galaxy smartphone that you can buy off the shelf,
p57
aVand all you need is an app that you can download from our app store.
p58
aVAnd you can see this robot reading the letters, "TED" in this case,
p59
aVlooking at the corners of the "T" and the "E"
p60
aVand then triangulating off of that, flying autonomously.
p61
aVThat joystick is just there to make sure if the robot goes crazy,
p62
aVGiuseppe can kill it.
p63
aa(lp64
V(Laughter)
p65
aa(lp66
VIn addition to building these small robots,
p67
aVwe also experiment with aggressive behaviors, like you see here.
p68
aVSo this robot is now traveling at two to three meters per second,
p69
aVpitching and rolling aggressively as it changes direction.
p70
aVThe main point is we can have smaller robots that can go faster
p71
aVand then travel in these very unstructured environments.
p72
aa(lp73
VAnd in this next video,
p74
aVjust like you see this bird, an eagle, gracefully coordinating its wings,
p75
aVits eyes and feet to grab prey out of the water,
p76
aVour robot can go fishing, too.
p77
aa(lp78
V(Laughter)
p79
aa(lp80
VIn this case, this is a Philly cheesesteak hoagie that it's grabbing out of thin air.
p81
aa(lp82
V(Laughter)
p83
aa(lp84
VSo you can see this robot going at about three meters per second,
p85
aVwhich is faster than walking speed, coordinating its arms, its claws
p86
aVand its flight with split-second timing to achieve this maneuver.
p87
aVIn another experiment,
p88
aVI want to show you how the robot adapts its flight
p89
aVto control its suspended payload,
p90
aVwhose length is actually larger than the width of the window.
p91
aVSo in order to accomplish this,
p92
aVit actually has to pitch and adjust the altitude
p93
aVand swing the payload through.
p94
aVBut of course we want to make these even smaller,
p95
aVand we're inspired in particular by honeybees.
p96
aVSo if you look at honeybees, and this is a slowed down video,
p97
aVthey're so small, the inertia is so lightweight \u2014
p98
aa(lp99
V(Laughter)
p100
aa(lp101
Vthat they don't care \u2014 they bounce off my hand, for example.
p102
aVThis is a little robot that mimics the honeybee behavior.
p103
aVAnd smaller is better,
p104
aVbecause along with the small size you get lower inertia.
p105
aVAlong with lower inertia \u2014
p106
aa(lp107
V(Robot buzzing, laughter)
p108
aa(lp109
Valong with lower inertia, you're resistant to collisions.
p110
aVAnd that makes you more robust.
p111
aVSo just like these honeybees, we build small robots.
p112
aVAnd this particular one is only 25 grams in weight.
p113
aVIt consumes only six watts of power.
p114
aVAnd it can travel up to six meters per second.
p115
aVSo if I normalize that to its size,
p116
aVit's like a Boeing 787 traveling ten times the speed of sound.
p117
aa(lp118
V(Laughter)
p119
aa(lp120
VAnd I want to show you an example.
p121
aVThis is probably the first planned mid-air collision, at one-twentieth normal speed.
p122
aVThese are going at a relative speed of two meters per second,
p123
aVand this illustrates the basic principle.
p124
aVThe two-gram carbon fiber cage around it prevents the propellers from entangling,
p125
aVbut essentially the collision is absorbed and the robot responds to the collisions.
p126
aVAnd so small also means safe.
p127
aVIn my lab, as we developed these robots,
p128
aVwe start off with these big robots
p129
aVand then now we're down to these small robots.
p130
aVAnd if you plot a histogram of the number of Band-Aids we've ordered
p131
aVin the past, that sort of tailed off now.
p132
aVBecause these robots are really safe.
p133
aa(lp134
VThe small size has some disadvantages,
p135
aVand nature has found a number of ways to compensate for these disadvantages.
p136
aVThe basic idea is they aggregate to form large groups, or swarms.
p137
aVSo, similarly, in our lab, we try to create artificial robot swarms.
p138
aVAnd this is quite challenging
p139
aVbecause now you have to think about networks of robots.
p140
aVAnd within each robot,
p141
aVyou have to think about the interplay of sensing, communication, computation \u2014
p142
aVand this network then becomes quite difficult to control and manage.
p143
aVSo from nature we take away three organizing principles
p144
aVthat essentially allow us to develop our algorithms.
p145
aVThe first idea is that robots need to be aware of their neighbors.
p146
aVThey need to be able to sense and communicate with their neighbors.
p147
aa(lp148
VSo this video illustrates the basic idea.
p149
aVYou have four robots \u2014
p150
aVone of the robots has actually been hijacked by a human operator, literally.
p151
aVBut because the robots interact with each other,
p152
aVthey sense their neighbors,
p153
aVthey essentially follow.
p154
aVAnd here there's a single person able to lead this network of followers.
p155
aVSo again, it's not because all the robots know where they're supposed to go.
p156
aVIt's because they're just reacting to the positions of their neighbors.
p157
aa(lp158
V(Laughter)
p159
aa(lp160
VSo the next experiment illustrates the second organizing principle.
p161
aVAnd this principle has to do with the principle of anonymity.
p162
aVHere the key idea is that
p163
aVthe robots are agnostic to the identities of their neighbors.
p164
aVThey're asked to form a circular shape,
p165
aVand no matter how many robots you introduce into the formation,
p166
aVor how many robots you pull out,
p167
aVeach robot is simply reacting to its neighbor.
p168
aVIt's aware of the fact that it needs to form the circular shape,
p169
aVbut collaborating with its neighbors
p170
aVit forms the shape without central coordination.
p171
aVNow if you put these ideas together,
p172
aVthe third idea is that we essentially give these robots
p173
aVmathematical descriptions of the shape they need to execute.
p174
aVAnd these shapes can be varying as a function of time,
p175
aVand you'll see these robots start from a circular formation,
p176
aVchange into a rectangular formation, stretch into a straight line,
p177
aVback into an ellipse.
p178
aVAnd they do this with the same kind of split-second coordination
p179
aVthat you see in natural swarms, in nature.
p180
aa(lp181
VSo why work with swarms?
p182
aVLet me tell you about two applications that we are very interested in.
p183
aVThe first one has to do with agriculture,
p184
aVwhich is probably the biggest problem that we're facing worldwide.
p185
aVAs you well know,
p186
aVone in every seven persons in this earth is malnourished.
p187
aVMost of the land that we can cultivate has already been cultivated.
p188
aVAnd the efficiency of most systems in the world is improving,
p189
aVbut our production system efficiency is actually declining.
p190
aVAnd that's mostly because of water shortage, crop diseases, climate change
p191
aVand a couple of other things.
p192
aa(lp193
VSo what can robots do?
p194
aVWell, we adopt an approach that's called Precision Farming in the community.
p195
aVAnd the basic idea is that we fly aerial robots through orchards,
p196
aVand then we build precision models of individual plants.
p197
aVSo just like personalized medicine,
p198
aVwhile you might imagine wanting to treat every patient individually,
p199
aVwhat we'd like to do is build models of individual plants
p200
aVand then tell the farmer what kind of inputs every plant needs \u2014
p201
aVthe inputs in this case being water, fertilizer and pesticide.
p202
aVHere you'll see robots traveling through an apple orchard,
p203
aVand in a minute you'll see two of its companions
p204
aVdoing the same thing on the left side.
p205
aVAnd what they're doing is essentially building a map of the orchard.
p206
aVWithin the map is a map of every plant in this orchard.
p207
aa(lp208
V(Robot buzzing)
p209
aa(lp210
VLet's see what those maps look like.
p211
aVIn the next video, you'll see the cameras that are being used on this robot.
p212
aVOn the top-left is essentially a standard color camera.
p213
aVOn the left-center is an infrared camera.
p214
aVAnd on the bottom-left is a thermal camera.
p215
aVAnd on the main panel, you're seeing a three-dimensional reconstruction
p216
aVof every tree in the orchard as the sensors fly right past the trees.
p217
aVArmed with information like this, we can do several things.
p218
aVThe first and possibly the most important thing we can do is very simple:
p219
aVcount the number of fruits on every tree.
p220
aVBy doing this, you tell the farmer how many fruits she has in every tree
p221
aVand allow her to estimate the yield in the orchard,
p222
aVoptimizing the production chain downstream.
p223
aa(lp224
VThe second thing we can do
p225
aVis take models of plants, construct three-dimensional reconstructions,
p226
aVand from that estimate the canopy size,
p227
aVand then correlate the canopy size to the amount of leaf area on every plant.
p228
aVAnd this is called the leaf area index.
p229
aVSo if you know this leaf area index,
p230
aVyou essentially have a measure of how much photosynthesis is possible in every plant,
p231
aVwhich again tells you how healthy each plant is.
p232
aVBy combining visual and infrared information,
p233
aVwe can also compute indices such as NDVI.
p234
aVAnd in this particular case, you can essentially see
p235
aVthere are some crops that are not doing as well as other crops.
p236
aVThis is easily discernible from imagery,
p237
aVnot just visual imagery but combining
p238
aVboth visual imagery and infrared imagery.
p239
aa(lp240
VAnd then lastly,
p241
aVone thing we're interested in doing is detecting the early onset of chlorosis \u2014
p242
aVand this is an orange tree \u2014
p243
aVwhich is essentially seen by yellowing of leaves.
p244
aVBut robots flying overhead can easily spot this autonomously
p245
aVand then report to the farmer that he or she has a problem
p246
aVin this section of the orchard.
p247
aa(lp248
VSystems like this can really help,
p249
aVand we're projecting yields that can improve by about ten percent
p250
aVand, more importantly, decrease the amount of inputs such as water
p251
aVby 25 percent by using aerial robot swarms.
p252
aa(lp253
VLastly, I want you to applaud the people who actually create the future,
p254
aVYash Mulgaonkar, Sikang Liu and Giuseppe Loianno,
p255
aVwho are responsible for the three demonstrations that you saw.
p256
aa(lp257
VThank you.
