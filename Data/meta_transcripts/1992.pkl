VWhen I was a young officer, they told me
p4
aVto follow my instincts,
p5
aVto go with my gut,
p6
aVand what I've learned
p7
aVis that often our instincts are wrong.
p8
aa(lp9
VIn the summer of 2010,
p10
aVthere was a massive leak of classified documents
p11
aVthat came out of the Pentagon.
p12
aVIt shocked the world,
p13
aVit shook up the American government,
p14
aVand it made people ask a lot of questions,
p15
aVbecause the sheer amount of information
p16
aVthat was let out, and the potential impacts,
p17
aVwere significant.
p18
aVAnd one of the first questions we asked ourselves
p19
aVwas why would a young soldier have access
p20
aVto that much information?
p21
aVWhy would we let sensitive things
p22
aVbe with a relatively young person?
p23
aa(lp24
VIn the summer of 2003, I was assigned to command
p25
aVa special operations task force,
p26
aVand that task force was spread across the Mideast
p27
aVto fight al Qaeda.
p28
aVOur main effort was inside Iraq,
p29
aVand our specified mission
p30
aVwas to defeat al Qaeda in Iraq.
p31
aVFor almost five years I stayed there,
p32
aVand we focused on fighting a war
p33
aVthat was unconventional and it was difficult
p34
aVand it was bloody
p35
aVand it often claimed its highest price
p36
aVamong innocent people.
p37
aVWe did everything we could
p38
aVto stop al Qaeda
p39
aVand the foreign fighters that came in as suicide bombers
p40
aVand as accelerants to the violence.
p41
aVWe honed our combat skills,
p42
aVwe developed new equipment,
p43
aVwe parachuted, we helicoptered,
p44
aVwe took small boats, we drove, and we walked
p45
aVto objectives night after night to stop
p46
aVthe killing that this network was putting forward.
p47
aVWe bled,
p48
aVwe died,
p49
aVand we killed to stop that organization
p50
aVfrom the violence that they were putting
p51
aVlargely against the Iraqi people.
p52
aa(lp53
VNow, we did what we knew,
p54
aVhow we had grown up, and one of the things that we knew,
p55
aVthat was in our DNA, was secrecy.
p56
aVIt was security. It was protecting information.
p57
aVIt was the idea that information was the lifeblood
p58
aVand it was what would protect and keep people safe.
p59
aVAnd we had a sense that,
p60
aVas we operated within our organizations,
p61
aVit was important to keep information
p62
aVin the silos within the organizations,
p63
aVparticularly only give information
p64
aVto people had a demonstrated need to know.
p65
aVBut the question often came, who needed to know?
p66
aVWho needed, who had to have the information
p67
aVso that they could do the important  parts of the job that you needed?
p68
aVAnd in a tightly coupled world,
p69
aVthat's very hard to predict.
p70
aVIt's very hard to know who needs to have information
p71
aVand who doesn't.
p72
aVI used to deal with intelligence agencies,
p73
aVand I'd complain that they weren't sharing enough intelligence,
p74
aVand with a straight face, they'd look at me and they'd say,
p75
aV"What aren't you getting?" (Laughter)
p76
aVI said, "If I knew that, we wouldn't have a problem."
p77
aa(lp78
VBut what we found is we had to change.
p79
aVWe had to change our culture about information.
p80
aVWe had to knock down walls. We had to share.
p81
aVWe had to change from who needs to know
p82
aVto the fact that who doesn't know,
p83
aVand we need to tell, and tell them as quickly as we can.
p84
aVIt was a significant culture shift for an organization
p85
aVthat had secrecy in its DNA.
p86
aa(lp87
VWe started by doing things, by building,
p88
aVnot working in offices,
p89
aVknocking down walls, working in things we called
p90
aVsituation awareness rooms,
p91
aVand in the summer of 2007,
p92
aVsomething happened which demonstrated this.
p93
aVWe captured the personnel records
p94
aVfor the people who were bringing foreign fighters
p95
aVinto Iraq.
p96
aVAnd when we got the personnel records, typically,
p97
aVwe would have hidden these,
p98
aVshared them with a few intelligence agencies,
p99
aVand then try to operate with them.
p100
aVBut as I was talking to my intelligence officer,
p101
aVI said, "What do we do?"
p102
aVAnd he said, "Well, you found them." Our command.
p103
aV"You can just declassify them."
p104
aVAnd I said, "Well, can we declassify them?
p105
aVWhat if the enemy finds out?"
p106
aVAnd he says, "They're their personnel records."
p107
aV(Laughter)
p108
aa(lp109
VSo we did,
p110
aVand a lot of people got upset about that,
p111
aVbut as we passed that information around,
p112
aVsuddenly you find that information is only of value
p113
aVif you give it to people who have the ability
p114
aVto do something with it.
p115
aVThe fact that I know something has zero value
p116
aVif I'm not the person who can actually
p117
aVmake something better because of it.
p118
aVSo as a consequence, what we did was
p119
aVwe changed the idea of information,
p120
aVinstead of knowledge is power,
p121
aVto one where sharing is power.
p122
aVIt was the fundamental shift,
p123
aVnot new tactics, not new weapons,
p124
aVnot new anything else.
p125
aVIt was the idea that we were now part of a team
p126
aVin which information became the essential link
p127
aVbetween us, not a block between us.
p128
aa(lp129
VAnd I want everybody to take a deep breath
p130
aVand let it out,
p131
aVbecause in your life, there's going to be information
p132
aVthat leaks out you're not going to like.
p133
aVSomebody's going to get my college grades out,
p134
aVa that's going to be a disaster. (Laughter)
p135
aVBut it's going to be okay, and I will tell you that
p136
aVI am more scared of the bureaucrat
p137
aVthat holds information in a desk drawer
p138
aVor in a safe than I am of someone who leaks,
p139
aVbecause ultimately, we'll be better off if we share.
p140
aa(lp141
VThank you.

VHelen Walters: So I don't know if you were here this morning,
p146
aVif you were able to catch Rick Ledgett,
p147
aVthe deputy director of the NSA
p148
aVwho was responding to Edward Snowden's talk earlier this week.
p149
aVI just wonder, do you think the American government
p150
aVshould give Edward Snowden amnesty?
p151
aa(lp152
VStanley McChrystal: I think that Rick said something very important.
p153
aVWe, most people, don't know all the facts.
p154
aVI think there are two parts of this.
p155
aVEdward Snowden shined a light on an important need
p156
aVthat people had to understand.
p157
aVHe also took a lot of documents that he didn't have
p158
aVthe knowledge to know the importance of,
p159
aVso I think we need to learn the facts about this case
p160
aVbefore we make snap judgments
p161
aVabout Edward Snowden.
p162
aVHW: Thank you so much. Thank you.
