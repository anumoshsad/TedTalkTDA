VAn evolutionary biologist at Purdue University
p4
aVnamed William Muir studied chickens.
p5
aVHe was interested in productivity \u2014
p6
aVI think it's something that concerns all of us \u2014
p7
aVbut it's easy to measure in chickens because you just count the eggs.
p8
aV(Laughter)
p9
aVHe wanted to know what could make his chickens more productive,
p10
aVso he devised a beautiful experiment.
p11
aVChickens live in groups, so first of all, he selected just an average flock,
p12
aVand he let it alone for six generations.
p13
aVBut then he created a second group
p14
aVof the individually most productive chickens \u2014
p15
aVyou could call them superchickens \u2014
p16
aVand he put them together in a superflock,
p17
aVand each generation, he selected only the most productive for breeding.
p18
aa(lp19
VAfter six generations had passed,
p20
aVwhat did he find?
p21
aVWell, the first group, the average group, was doing just fine.
p22
aVThey were all plump and fully feathered
p23
aVand egg production had increased dramatically.
p24
aVWhat about the second group?
p25
aVWell, all but three were dead.
p26
aVThey'd pecked the rest to death.
p27
aV(Laughter)
p28
aVThe individually productive chickens had only achieved their success
p29
aVby suppressing the productivity of the rest.
p30
aa(lp31
VNow, as I've gone around the world talking about this and telling this story
p32
aVin all sorts of organizations and companies,
p33
aVpeople have seen the relevance almost instantly,
p34
aVand they come up and they say things to me like,
p35
aV"That superflock, that's my company."
p36
aV(Laughter)
p37
aVOr, "That's my country."
p38
aVOr, "That's my life."
p39
aa(lp40
VAll my life I've been told that the way we have to get ahead is to compete:
p41
aVget into the right school, get into the right job, get to the top,
p42
aVand I've really never found it very inspiring.
p43
aVI've started and run businesses because invention is a joy,
p44
aVand because working alongside brilliant, creative people
p45
aVis its own reward.
p46
aVAnd I've never really felt very motivated by pecking orders or by superchickens
p47
aVor by superstars.
p48
aVBut for the past 50 years,
p49
aVwe've run most organizations and some societies
p50
aValong the superchicken model.
p51
aVWe've thought that success is achieved by picking the superstars,
p52
aVthe brightest men, or occasionally women, in the room,
p53
aVand giving them all the resources and all the power.
p54
aVAnd the result has been just the same as in William Muir's experiment:
p55
aVaggression, dysfunction and waste.
p56
aVIf the only way the most productive can be successful
p57
aVis by suppressing the productivity of the rest,
p58
aVthen we badly need to find a better way to work
p59
aVand a richer way to live.
p60
aV(Applause)
p61
aa(lp62
VSo what is it that makes some groups
p63
aVobviously more successful and more productive than others?
p64
aVWell, that's the question a team at MIT took to research.
p65
aVThey brought in hundreds of volunteers,
p66
aVthey put them into groups, and they gave them very hard problems to solve.
p67
aVAnd what happened was exactly what you'd expect,
p68
aVthat some groups were very much more successful than others,
p69
aVbut what was really interesting was that the high-achieving groups
p70
aVwere not those where they had one or two people
p71
aVwith spectacularly high I.Q.
p72
aVNor were the most successful groups the ones that had the highest
p73
aVaggregate I.Q.
p74
aVInstead, they had three characteristics, the really successful teams.
p75
aVFirst of all, they showed high degrees of social sensitivity to each other.
p76
aVThis is measured by something called the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test.
p77
aVIt's broadly considered a test for empathy,
p78
aVand the groups that scored highly on this
p79
aVdid better.
p80
aVSecondly, the successful groups gave roughly equal time to each other,
p81
aVso that no one voice dominated,
p82
aVbut neither were there any passengers.
p83
aVAnd thirdly, the more successful groups
p84
aVhad more women in them.
p85
aV(Applause)
p86
aVNow, was this because women typically score more highly on
p87
aVthe Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test,
p88
aVso you're getting a doubling down on the empathy quotient?
p89
aVOr was it because they brought a more diverse perspective?
p90
aVWe don't really know, but the striking thing about this experiment
p91
aVis that it showed what we know, which is some groups do better than others,
p92
aVbut what's key to that
p93
aVis their social connectedness to each other.
p94
aa(lp95
VSo how does this play out in the real world?
p96
aVWell, it means that what happens between people really counts,
p97
aVbecause in groups that are highly attuned and sensitive to each other,
p98
aVideas can flow and grow.
p99
aVPeople don't get stuck. They don't waste energy down dead ends.
p100
aa(lp101
VAn example: Arup is one of the world's most successful engineering firms,
p102
aVand it was commissioned to build the equestrian center
p103
aVfor the Beijing Olympics.
p104
aVNow, this building had to receive
p105
aVtwo and a half thousand really highly strung thoroughbred horses
p106
aVthat were coming off long-haul flights,
p107
aVhighly jet-lagged, not feeling their finest.
p108
aVAnd the problem the engineer confronted was,
p109
aVwhat quantity of waste to cater for?
p110
aVNow, you don't get taught this in engineering school \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p111
aVand it's not really the kind of thing you want to get wrong,
p112
aVso he could have spent months talking to vets, doing the research,
p113
aVtweaking the spreadsheet.
p114
aVInstead, he asked for help
p115
aVand he found someone who had designed the Jockey Club in New York.
p116
aVThe problem was solved in less than a day.
p117
aVArup believes that the culture of helpfulness
p118
aVis central to their success.
p119
aa(lp120
VNow, helpfulness sounds really anemic,
p121
aVbut it's absolutely core to successful teams,
p122
aVand it routinely outperforms individual intelligence.
p123
aVHelpfulness means I don't have to know everything,
p124
aVI just have to work among people who are good at getting and giving help.
p125
aVAt SAP, they reckon that you can answer any question in 17 minutes.
p126
aVBut there isn't a single high-tech company I've worked with
p127
aVthat imagines for a moment that this is a technology issue,
p128
aVbecause what drives helpfulness is people getting to know each other.
p129
aVNow that sounds so obvious, and we think it'll just happen normally,
p130
aVbut it doesn't.
p131
aVWhen I was running my first software company,
p132
aVI realized that we were getting stuck.
p133
aVThere was a lot of friction, but not much else,
p134
aVand I gradually realized the brilliant, creative people that I'd hired
p135
aVdidn't know each other.
p136
aVThey were so focused on their own individual work,
p137
aVthey didn't even know who they were sitting next to,
p138
aVand it was only when I insisted that we stop working
p139
aVand invest time in getting to know each other
p140
aVthat we achieved real momentum.
p141
aa(lp142
VNow, that was 20 years ago, and now I visit companies
p143
aVthat have banned coffee cups at desks
p144
aVbecause they want people to hang out around the coffee machines
p145
aVand talk to each other.
p146
aVThe Swedes even have a special term for this.
p147
aVThey call it fika, which means more than a coffee break.
p148
aVIt means collective restoration.
p149
aVAt Idexx, a company up in Maine,
p150
aVthey've created vegetable gardens on campus so that people
p151
aVfrom different parts of the business
p152
aVcan work together and get to know the whole business that way.
p153
aVHave they all gone mad?
p154
aVQuite the opposite \u2014 they've figured out that when the going gets tough,
p155
aVand it always will get tough
p156
aVif you're doing breakthrough work that really matters,
p157
aVwhat people need is social support,
p158
aVand they need to know who to ask for help.
p159
aVCompanies don't have ideas; only people do.
p160
aVAnd what motivates people
p161
aVare the bonds and loyalty and trust they develop between each other.
p162
aVWhat matters is the mortar,
p163
aVnot just the bricks.
p164
aa(lp165
VNow, when you put all of this together,
p166
aVwhat you get is something called social capital.
p167
aVSocial capital is the reliance and interdependency that builds trust.
p168
aVThe term comes from sociologists who were studying communities
p169
aVthat proved particularly resilient in times of stress.
p170
aVSocial capital is what gives companies momentum,
p171
aVand social capital is what makes companies robust.
p172
aVWhat does this mean in practical terms?
p173
aVIt means that time is everything,
p174
aVbecause social capital compounds with time.
p175
aVSo teams that work together longer get better, because it takes time
p176
aVto develop the trust you need for real candor and openness.
p177
aVAnd time is what builds value.
p178
aVWhen Alex Pentland suggested to one company
p179
aVthat they synchronize coffee breaks
p180
aVso that people would have time to talk to each other,
p181
aVprofits went up 15 million dollars,
p182
aVand employee satisfaction went up 10 percent.
p183
aVNot a bad return on social capital,
p184
aVwhich compounds even as you spend it.
p185
aVNow, this isn't about chumminess, and it's no charter for slackers,
p186
aVbecause people who work this way tend to be kind of scratchy,
p187
aVimpatient, absolutely determined to think for themselves
p188
aVbecause that's what their contribution is.
p189
aVConflict is frequent because candor is safe.
p190
aVAnd that's how good ideas turn into great ideas,
p191
aVbecause no idea is born fully formed.
p192
aVIt emerges a little bit as a child is born,
p193
aVkind of messy and confused, but full of possibilities.
p194
aVAnd it's only through the generous contribution, faith and challenge
p195
aVthat they achieve their potential.
p196
aVAnd that's what social capital supports.
p197
aa(lp198
VNow, we aren't really used to talking about this,
p199
aVabout talent, about creativity, in this way.
p200
aVWe're used to talking about stars.
p201
aVSo I started to wonder, well, if we start working this way,
p202
aVdoes that mean no more stars?
p203
aVSo I went and I sat in on the auditions
p204
aVat the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London.
p205
aVAnd what I saw there really surprised me,
p206
aVbecause the teachers weren't looking for individual pyrotechnics.
p207
aVThey were looking for what happened between the students,
p208
aVbecause that's where the drama is.
p209
aVAnd when I talked to producers of hit albums,
p210
aVthey said, "Oh sure, we have lots of superstars in music.
p211
aVIt's just, they don't last very long.
p212
aVIt's the outstanding collaborators who enjoy the long careers,
p213
aVbecause bringing out the best in others is how they found the best
p214
aVin themselves."
p215
aVAnd when I went to visit companies that are renowned
p216
aVfor their ingenuity and creativity,
p217
aVI couldn't even see any superstars,
p218
aVbecause everybody there really mattered.
p219
aVAnd when I reflected on my own career,
p220
aVand the extraordinary people I've had the privilege to work with,
p221
aVI realized how much more we could give each other
p222
aVif we just stopped trying to be superchickens.
p223
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p224
aVOnce you appreciate truly how social work is,
p225
aVa lot of things have to change.
p226
aVManagement by talent contest has routinely pitted
p227
aVemployees against each other.
p228
aVNow, rivalry has to be replaced by social capital.
p229
aVFor decades, we've tried to motivate people with money,
p230
aVeven though we've got a vast amount of research that shows
p231
aVthat money erodes social connectedness.
p232
aVNow, we need to let people motivate each other.
p233
aVAnd for years, we've thought that leaders were heroic soloists who were expected,
p234
aVall by themselves, to solve complex problems.
p235
aVNow, we need to redefine leadership
p236
aVas an activity in which conditions are created
p237
aVin which everyone can do their most courageous thinking together.
p238
aa(lp239
VWe know that this works.
p240
aVWhen the Montreal Protocol called for the phasing out of CFCs,
p241
aVthe chlorofluorocarbons implicated in the hole in the ozone layer,
p242
aVthe risks were immense.
p243
aVCFCs were everywhere,
p244
aVand nobody knew if a substitute could be found.
p245
aVBut one team that rose to the challenge adopted three key principles.
p246
aVThe first was the head of engineering, Frank Maslen, said,
p247
aVthere will be no stars in this team.
p248
aVWe need everybody.
p249
aVEverybody has a valid perspective.
p250
aVSecond, we work to one standard only:
p251
aVthe best imaginable.
p252
aVAnd third, he told his boss, Geoff Tudhope,
p253
aVthat he had to butt out,
p254
aVbecause he knew how disruptive power can be.
p255
aVNow, this didn't mean Tudhope did nothing.
p256
aVHe gave the team air cover,
p257
aVand he listened to ensure that they honored their principles.
p258
aVAnd it worked: Ahead of all the other companies tackling this hard problem,
p259
aVthis group cracked it first.
p260
aVAnd to date, the Montreal Protocol
p261
aVis the most successful international environmental agreement
p262
aVever implemented.
p263
aa(lp264
VThere was a lot at stake then,
p265
aVand there's a lot at stake now,
p266
aVand we won't solve our problems if we expect it to be solved
p267
aVby a few supermen or superwomen.
p268
aVNow we need everybody,
p269
aVbecause it is only when we accept that everybody has value
p270
aVthat we will liberate the energy and imagination and momentum we need
p271
aVto create the best beyond measure.
p272
aa(lp273
VThank you.
