VSleep.
p4
aVIt's something we spend about a third of our lives doing,
p5
aVbut do any of us really understand what it's all about?
p6
aa(lp7
VTwo thousand years ago, Galen,
p8
aVone of the most prominent medical researchers
p9
aVof the ancient world,
p10
aVproposed that while we're awake,
p11
aVour brain's motive force, its juice,
p12
aVwould flow out to all the other parts of the body,
p13
aVanimating them but leaving the brain all dried up,
p14
aVand he thought that when we sleep,
p15
aVall this moisture that filled the rest of the body
p16
aVwould come rushing back,
p17
aVrehydrating the brain
p18
aVand refreshing the mind.
p19
aVNow, that sounds completely ridiculous to us now,
p20
aVbut Galen was simply trying to explain
p21
aVsomething about sleep
p22
aVthat we all deal with every day.
p23
aVSee, we all know based on our own experience
p24
aVthat when you sleep, it clears your mind,
p25
aVand when you don't sleep,
p26
aVit leaves your mind murky.
p27
aVBut while we know a great deal more about sleep now
p28
aVthan when Galen was around,
p29
aVwe still haven't understood why it is that sleep,
p30
aVof all of our activities, has this incredible
p31
aVrestorative function for the mind.
p32
aa(lp33
VSo today I want to tell you about
p34
aVsome recent research
p35
aVthat may shed new light on this question.
p36
aVWe've found that sleep may actually be
p37
aVa kind of elegant design solution
p38
aVto some of the brain's most basic needs,
p39
aVa unique way that the brain
p40
aVmeets the high demands and the narrow margins
p41
aVthat set it apart from all the other organs of the body.
p42
aa(lp43
VSo almost all the biology that we observe
p44
aVcan be thought of as a series of problems
p45
aVand their corresponding solutions,
p46
aVand the first problem that every organ must solve
p47
aVis a continuous supply of nutrients to fuel
p48
aVall those cells of the body.
p49
aVIn the brain, that is especially critical;
p50
aVits intense electrical activity uses up
p51
aVa quarter of the body's entire energy supply,
p52
aVeven though the brain accounts
p53
aVfor only about two percent of the body's mass.
p54
aVSo the circulatory system
p55
aVsolves the nutrient delivery problem
p56
aVby sending blood vessels to supply nutrients
p57
aVand oxygen to every corner of our body.
p58
aa(lp59
VYou can actually see it in this video here.
p60
aVHere, we're imaging blood vessels
p61
aVin the brain of a living mouse.
p62
aVThe blood vessels form a complex network
p63
aVthat fills the entire brain volume.
p64
aVThey start at the surface of the brain,
p65
aVand then they dive down into the tissue itself,
p66
aVand as they spread out, they supply nutrients
p67
aVand oxygen to each and every cell in the brain.
p68
aa(lp69
VNow, just as every cell requires
p70
aVnutrients to fuel it,
p71
aVevery cell also produces waste as a byproduct,
p72
aVand the clearance of that waste
p73
aVis the second basic problem
p74
aVthat each organ has to solve.
p75
aVThis diagram shows the body's lymphatic system,
p76
aVwhich has evolved to meet this need.
p77
aVIt's a second parallel network of vessels
p78
aVthat extends throughout the body.
p79
aVIt takes up proteins and other waste
p80
aVfrom the spaces between the cells,
p81
aVit collects them, and then dumps them into the blood
p82
aVso they can be disposed of.
p83
aa(lp84
VBut if you look really closely at this diagram,
p85
aVyou'll see something
p86
aVthat doesn't make a lot of sense.
p87
aVSo if we were to zoom into this guy's head,
p88
aVone of the things that you would see there
p89
aVis that there are no lymphatic vessels in the brain.
p90
aVBut that doesn't make a lot of sense, does it?
p91
aVI mean, the brain is this intensely active organ
p92
aVthat produces a correspondingly large amount of waste
p93
aVthat must be efficiently cleared.
p94
aVAnd yet, it lacks lymphatic vessels, which means that
p95
aVthe approach that the rest of the body takes
p96
aVto clearing away its waste
p97
aVwon't work in the brain.
p98
aa(lp99
VSo how, then, does the brain solve
p100
aVits waste clearance problem?
p101
aVWell, that seemingly mundane question
p102
aVis where our group first jumped into this story,
p103
aVand what we found
p104
aVas we dove down into the brain,
p105
aVdown among the neurons and the blood vessels,
p106
aVwas that the brain's solution
p107
aVto the problem of waste clearance,
p108
aVit was really unexpected.
p109
aVIt was ingenious,
p110
aVbut it was also beautiful.
p111
aVLet me tell you about what we found.
p112
aa(lp113
VSo the brain has this large pool
p114
aVof clean, clear fluid called cerebrospinal fluid.
p115
aVWe call it the CSF.
p116
aVThe CSF fills the space that surrounds the brain,
p117
aVand wastes from inside the brain
p118
aVmake their way out to the CSF,
p119
aVwhich gets dumped, along with  the waste, into the blood.
p120
aVSo in that way, it sounds a lot like
p121
aVthe lymphatic system, doesn't it?
p122
aVBut what's interesting is that the fluid and the waste
p123
aVfrom inside the brain,
p124
aVthey don't just percolate their way randomly
p125
aVout to these pools of CSF.
p126
aVInstead, there is a specialized network of plumbing
p127
aVthat organizes and facilitates this process.
p128
aVYou can see that in these videos.
p129
aVHere, we're again imaging into the brain
p130
aVof living mice.
p131
aVThe frame on your left shows
p132
aVwhat's happening at the brain's surface,
p133
aVand the frame on your right shows
p134
aVwhat's happening down below the surface of the brain
p135
aVwithin the tissue itself.
p136
aVWe've labeled the blood vessels in red,
p137
aVand the CSF that's surrounding the brain
p138
aVwill be in green.
p139
aVNow, what was surprising to us
p140
aVwas that the fluid on the outside of the brain,
p141
aVit didn't stay on the outside.
p142
aVInstead, the CSF was pumped back into
p143
aVand through the brain
p144
aValong the outsides of the blood vessels,
p145
aVand as it flushed down into the brain
p146
aValong the outsides of these vessels,
p147
aVit was actually helping to clear away,
p148
aVto clean the waste from the spaces
p149
aVbetween the brain's cells.
p150
aVIf you think about it,
p151
aVusing the outsides of these blood vessels like this
p152
aVis a really clever design solution,
p153
aVbecause the brain is enclosed
p154
aVin a rigid skull
p155
aVand it's packed full of cells,
p156
aVso there is no extra space inside it
p157
aVfor a whole second set of vessels like the lymphatic system.
p158
aVYet the blood vessels,
p159
aVthey extend from the surface of the brain
p160
aVdown to reach every single cell in the brain,
p161
aVwhich means that fluid
p162
aVthat's traveling along the outsides of these vessels
p163
aVcan gain easy access to the entire brain's volume,
p164
aVso it's actually this really clever way
p165
aVto repurpose one set of vessels, the blood vessels,
p166
aVto take over and replace the function
p167
aVof a second set of vessels, the lymphatic vessels,
p168
aVto make it so you don't need them.
p169
aVAnd what's amazing is that no other organ
p170
aVtakes quite this approach
p171
aVto clearing away the waste from between its cells.
p172
aVThis is a solution that is entirely unique to the brain.
p173
aa(lp174
VBut our most surprising finding
p175
aVwas that all of this,
p176
aVeverything I just told you about,
p177
aVwith all this fluid rushing through the brain,
p178
aVit's only happening in the sleeping brain.
p179
aVHere, the video on the left
p180
aVshows how much of the CSF is moving
p181
aVthrough the brain of a living mouse while it's awake.
p182
aVIt's almost nothing.
p183
aVYet in the same animal,
p184
aVif we wait just a little while until it's gone to sleep,
p185
aVwhat we see is that the CSF
p186
aVis rushing through the brain,
p187
aVand we discovered that at the same time
p188
aVwhen the brain goes to sleep,
p189
aVthe brain cells themselves seem to shrink,
p190
aVopening up spaces in between them,
p191
aVallowing fluid to rush through
p192
aVand allowing waste to be cleared out.
p193
aa(lp194
VSo it seems that Galen may actually have been
p195
aVsort of on the right track when he wrote about
p196
aVfluid rushing through the brain
p197
aVwhen sleep came on.
p198
aVOur own research, now it's 2,000 years later,
p199
aVsuggests that what's happening is that
p200
aVwhen the brain is awake
p201
aVand is at its most busy,
p202
aVit puts off clearing away the waste
p203
aVfrom the spaces between its cells until later,
p204
aVand then, when it goes to sleep
p205
aVand doesn't have to be as busy,
p206
aVit shifts into a kind of cleaning mode
p207
aVto clear away the waste
p208
aVfrom the spaces between its cells,
p209
aVthe waste that's accumulated throughout the day.
p210
aVSo it's actually a little bit like how you or I,
p211
aVwe put off our household chores during the work week
p212
aVwhen we don't have time to get to it,
p213
aVand then we play catch up on all the cleaning that we have to do
p214
aVwhen the weekend rolls around.
p215
aa(lp216
VNow, I've just talked a lot about waste clearance,
p217
aVbut I haven't been very specific
p218
aVabout the kinds of waste
p219
aVthat the brain needs to be clearing
p220
aVduring sleep in order to stay healthy.
p221
aVThe waste product that these recent studies
p222
aVfocused most on is amyloid-beta,
p223
aVwhich is a protein that's made in the brain all the time.
p224
aVMy brain's making amyloid-beta right now,
p225
aVand so is yours.
p226
aVBut in patients with Alzheimer's disease,
p227
aVamyloid-beta builds up and aggregates
p228
aVin the spaces between the brain's cells,
p229
aVinstead of being cleared away  like it's supposed to be,
p230
aVand it's this buildup of amyloid-beta
p231
aVthat's thought to be one of the key steps
p232
aVin the development of that terrible disease.
p233
aVSo we measured how fast amyloid-beta is cleared
p234
aVfrom the brain when it's awake
p235
aVversus when it's asleep,
p236
aVand we found that indeed,
p237
aVthe clearance of amyloid-beta
p238
aVis much more rapid from the sleeping brain.
p239
aa(lp240
VSo if sleep, then,
p241
aVis part of the brain's solution
p242
aVto the problem of waste clearance,
p243
aVthen this may dramatically change how we think
p244
aVabout the relationship between sleep,
p245
aVamyloid-beta, and Alzheimer's disease.
p246
aVA series of recent clinical studies
p247
aVsuggest that among patients
p248
aVwho haven't yet developed Alzheimer's disease,
p249
aVworsening sleep quality and sleep duration
p250
aVare associated with a greater amount
p251
aVof amyloid-beta building up in the brain,
p252
aVand while it's important to point out
p253
aVthat these studies don't prove
p254
aVthat lack of sleep or poor sleep
p255
aVcause Alzheimer's disease,
p256
aVthey do suggest that the failure of the brain
p257
aVto keep its house clean
p258
aVby clearing away waste like amyloid-beta
p259
aVmay contribute to the development
p260
aVof conditions like Alzheimer's.
p261
aa(lp262
VSo what this new research tells us, then,
p263
aVis that the one thing that all of you
p264
aValready knew about sleep,
p265
aVthat even Galen understood about sleep,
p266
aVthat it refreshes and clears the mind,
p267
aVmay actually be a big part
p268
aVof what sleep is all about.
p269
aVSee, you and I, we go to sleep
p270
aVevery single night,
p271
aVbut our brains, they never rest.
p272
aVWhile our body is still
p273
aVand our mind is off walking in dreams somewhere,
p274
aVthe elegant machinery of the brain
p275
aVis quietly hard at work
p276
aVcleaning and maintaining
p277
aVthis unimaginably complex machine.
p278
aVLike our housework,
p279
aVit's a dirty and a thankless job,
p280
aVbut it's also important.
p281
aVIn your house, if you stop cleaning your kitchen
p282
aVfor a month,
p283
aVyour home will become completely unlivable
p284
aVvery quickly.
p285
aVBut in the brain, the consequences
p286
aVof falling behind may be much greater
p287
aVthan the embarrassment of dirty countertops,
p288
aVbecause when it comes to cleaning the brain,
p289
aVit is the very health and function
p290
aVof the mind and the body that's at stake,
p291
aVwhich is why understanding these
p292
aVvery basic housekeeping functions of the brain today
p293
aVmay be critical for preventing and treating
p294
aVdiseases of the mind tomorrow.
