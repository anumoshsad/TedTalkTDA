VWhen I got my current job, I was given a good piece of advice,
p4
aVwhich was to interview three politicians every day.
p5
aVAnd from that much contact with politicians,
p6
aVI can tell you they're all emotional freaks of one sort or another.
p7
aVThey have what I called "logorrhea dementia,"
p8
aVwhich is they talk so much they drive themselves insane.
p9
aV(Laughter)
p10
aVBut what they do have is incredible social skills.
p11
aVWhen you meet them, they lock into you,
p12
aVthey look you in the eye,
p13
aVthey invade your personal space,
p14
aVthey massage the back of your head.
p15
aa(lp16
VI had dinner with a Republican senator several months ago
p17
aVwho kept his hand on my inner thigh
p18
aVthroughout the whole meal \u2014 squeezing it.
p19
aVI once \u2014 this was years ago \u2014
p20
aVI saw Ted Kennedy and Dan Quayle meet in the well of the Senate.
p21
aVAnd they were friends, and they hugged each other
p22
aVand they were laughing, and their faces were like this far apart.
p23
aVAnd they were moving and grinding
p24
aVand moving their arms up and down each other.
p25
aVAnd I was like, "Get a room. I don't want to see this."
p26
aVBut they have those social skills.
p27
aa(lp28
VAnother case:
p29
aVLast election cycle,
p30
aVI was following Mitt Romney around New Hampshire,
p31
aVand he was campaigning with his five perfect sons:
p32
aVBip, Chip, Rip, Zip, Lip and Dip.
p33
aV(Laughter)
p34
aVAnd he's going into a diner.
p35
aVAnd he goes into the diner, introduces himself to a family
p36
aVand says, "What village are you from in New Hampshire?"
p37
aVAnd then he describes the home he owned in their village.
p38
aVAnd so he goes around the room,
p39
aVand then as he's leaving the diner,
p40
aVhe first-names almost everybody he's just met.
p41
aVI was like, "Okay, that's social skill."
p42
aa(lp43
VBut the paradox is,
p44
aVwhen a lot of these people slip into the policy-making mode,
p45
aVthat social awareness vanishes
p46
aVand they start talking like accountants.
p47
aVSo in the course of my career,
p48
aVI have covered a series of failures.
p49
aVWe sent economists in the Soviet Union
p50
aVwith privatization plans when it broke up,
p51
aVand what they really lacked was social trust.
p52
aVWe invaded Iraq with a military
p53
aVoblivious to the cultural and psychological realities.
p54
aVWe had a financial regulatory regime
p55
aVbased on the assumptions
p56
aVthat traders were rational creatures
p57
aVwho wouldn't do anything stupid.
p58
aVFor 30 years, I've been covering school reform
p59
aVand we've basically reorganized the bureaucratic boxes \u2014
p60
aVcharters, private schools, vouchers \u2014
p61
aVbut we've had disappointing results year after year.
p62
aVAnd the fact is, people learn from people they love.
p63
aVAnd if you're not talking about the individual relationship
p64
aVbetween a teacher and a student,
p65
aVyou're not talking about that reality.
p66
aVBut that reality is expunged
p67
aVfrom our policy-making process.
p68
aa(lp69
VAnd so that's led to a question for me:
p70
aVWhy are the most socially-attuned people on earth
p71
aVcompletely dehumanized
p72
aVwhen they think about policy?
p73
aVAnd I came to the conclusion,
p74
aVthis is a symptom of a larger problem.
p75
aVThat, for centuries, we've inherited a view of human nature
p76
aVbased on the notion
p77
aVthat we're divided selves,
p78
aVthat reason is separated from the emotions
p79
aVand that society progresses
p80
aVto the extent that reason can suppress the passions.
p81
aVAnd it's led to a view of human nature
p82
aVthat we're rational individuals
p83
aVwho respond in straightforward ways to incentives,
p84
aVand it's led to ways of seeing the world
p85
aVwhere people try to use the assumptions of physics
p86
aVto measure how human behavior is.
p87
aVAnd it's produced a great amputation,
p88
aVa shallow view of human nature.
p89
aa(lp90
VWe're really good at talking about material things,
p91
aVbut we're really bad at talking about emotions.
p92
aVWe're really good at talking about skills
p93
aVand safety and health;
p94
aVwe're really bad at talking about character.
p95
aVAlasdair MacIntyre, the famous philosopher,
p96
aVsaid that, "We have the concepts of the ancient morality
p97
aVof virtue, honor, goodness,
p98
aVbut we no longer have a system
p99
aVby which to connect them."
p100
aVAnd so this has led to a shallow path in politics,
p101
aVbut also in a whole range of human endeavors.
p102
aa(lp103
VYou can see it in the way we raise our young kids.
p104
aVYou go to an elementary school at three in the afternoon
p105
aVand you watch the kids come out,
p106
aVand they're wearing these 80-pound backpacks.
p107
aVIf the wind blows them over, they're like beetles stuck there on the ground.
p108
aVYou see these cars that drive up \u2014
p109
aVusually it's Saabs and Audis and Volvos,
p110
aVbecause in certain neighborhoods it's socially acceptable to have a luxury car,
p111
aVso long as it comes from a country hostile to U.S. foreign policy \u2014
p112
aVthat's fine.
p113
aVThey get picked up by these creatures I've called uber-moms,
p114
aVwho are highly successful career women
p115
aVwho have taken time off to make sure all their kids get into Harvard.
p116
aVAnd you can usually tell the uber-moms
p117
aVbecause they actually weigh less than their own children.
p118
aV(Laughter)
p119
aVSo at the moment of conception,
p120
aVthey're doing little butt exercises.
p121
aVBabies flop out,
p122
aVthey're flashing Mandarin flashcards at the things.
p123
aa(lp124
VDriving them home, and they want them to be enlightened,
p125
aVso they take them to Ben & Jerry's ice cream company
p126
aVwith its own foreign policy.
p127
aVIn one of my books,
p128
aVI joke that Ben & Jerry's should make a pacifist toothpaste \u2014
p129
aVdoesn't kill germs, just asks them to leave.
p130
aVIt would be a big seller.
p131
aV(Laughter)
p132
aVAnd they go to Whole Foods to get their baby formula,
p133
aVand Whole Foods is one of those progressive grocery stores
p134
aVwhere all the cashiers look like they're on loan from Amnesty International.
p135
aV(Laughter)
p136
aVThey buy these seaweed-based snacks there
p137
aVcalled Veggie Booty with Kale,
p138
aVwhich is for kids who come home and say,
p139
aV"Mom, mom, I want a snack that'll help prevent colon-rectal cancer."
p140
aa(lp141
V(Laughter)
p142
aa(lp143
VAnd so the kids are raised in a certain way,
p144
aVjumping through achievement hoops of the things we can measure \u2014
p145
aVSAT prep, oboe, soccer practice.
p146
aVThey get into competitive colleges, they get good jobs,
p147
aVand sometimes they make a success of themselves
p148
aVin a superficial manner, and they make a ton of money.
p149
aVAnd sometimes you can see them at vacation places
p150
aVlike Jackson Hole or Aspen.
p151
aVAnd they've become elegant and slender \u2014
p152
aVthey don't really have thighs;
p153
aVthey just have one elegant calve on top of another.
p154
aV(Laughter)
p155
aVThey have kids of their own,
p156
aVand they've achieved a genetic miracle by marrying beautiful people,
p157
aVso their grandmoms look like Gertrude Stein,
p158
aVtheir daughters looks like Halle Berry \u2014 I don't know how they've done that.
p159
aVThey get there and they realize
p160
aVit's fashionable now to have dogs a third as tall as your ceiling heights.
p161
aVSo they've got these furry 160-pound dogs \u2014
p162
aVall look like velociraptors,
p163
aVall named after Jane Austen characters.
p164
aa(lp165
VAnd then when they get old, they haven't really developed a philosophy of life,
p166
aVbut they've decided, "I've been successful at everything;
p167
aVI'm just not going to die."
p168
aVAnd so they hire personal trainers;
p169
aVthey're popping Cialis like breath mints.
p170
aVYou see them on the mountains up there.
p171
aVThey're cross-country skiing up the mountain
p172
aVwith these grim expressions
p173
aVthat make Dick Cheney look like Jerry Lewis.
p174
aV(Laughter)
p175
aVAnd as they whiz by you,
p176
aVit's like being passed by a little iron Raisinet
p177
aVgoing up the hill.
p178
aa(lp179
V(Laughter)
p180
aa(lp181
VAnd so this is part of what life is,
p182
aVbut it's not all of what life is.
p183
aVAnd over the past few years,
p184
aVI think we've been given a deeper view of human nature
p185
aVand a deeper view of who we are.
p186
aVAnd it's not based on theology or philosophy,
p187
aVit's in the study of the mind,
p188
aVacross all these spheres of research,
p189
aVfrom neuroscience to the cognitive scientists,
p190
aVbehavioral economists, psychologists,
p191
aVsociology,
p192
aVwe're developing a revolution in consciousness.
p193
aVAnd when you synthesize it all,
p194
aVit's giving us a new view of human nature.
p195
aVAnd far from being a coldly materialistic view of nature,
p196
aVit's a new humanism, it's a new enchantment.
p197
aVAnd I think when you synthesize this research,
p198
aVyou start with three key insights.
p199
aa(lp200
VThe first insight is
p201
aVthat while the conscious mind writes the autobiography of our species,
p202
aVthe unconscious mind does most of the work.
p203
aVAnd so one way to formulate that is
p204
aVthe human mind can take in millions of pieces of information a minute,
p205
aVof which it can be consciously aware of about 40.
p206
aVAnd this leads to oddities.
p207
aVOne of my favorite is that people named Dennis
p208
aVare disproportionately likely to become dentists,
p209
aVpeople named Lawrence become lawyers,
p210
aVbecause unconsciously we gravitate toward things
p211
aVthat sound familiar,
p212
aVwhich is why I named my daughter President of the United States Brooks.
p213
aV(Laughter)
p214
aVAnother finding is that the unconscious,
p215
aVfar from being dumb and sexualized,
p216
aVis actually quite smart.
p217
aVSo one of the most cognitively demanding things we do is buy furniture.
p218
aVIt's really hard to imagine a sofa, how it's going to look in your house.
p219
aVAnd the way you should do that
p220
aVis study the furniture,
p221
aVlet it marinate in your mind, distract yourself,
p222
aVand then a few days later, go with your gut,
p223
aVbecause unconsciously you've figured it out.
p224
aa(lp225
VThe second insight
p226
aVis that emotions are at the center of our thinking.
p227
aVPeople with strokes and lesions
p228
aVin the emotion-processing parts of the brain
p229
aVare not super smart,
p230
aVthey're actually sometimes quite helpless.
p231
aVAnd the "giant" in the field is in the room tonight
p232
aVand is speaking tomorrow morning \u2014 Antonio Damasio.
p233
aVAnd one of the things he's really shown us
p234
aVis that emotions are not separate from reason,
p235
aVbut they are the foundation of reason
p236
aVbecause they tell us what to value.
p237
aVAnd so reading and educating your emotions
p238
aVis one of the central activities of wisdom.
p239
aa(lp240
VNow I'm a middle-aged guy.
p241
aVI'm not exactly comfortable with emotions.
p242
aVOne of my favorite brain stories described these middle-aged guys.
p243
aVThey put them into a brain scan machine \u2014
p244
aVthis is apocryphal by the way, but I don't care \u2014
p245
aVand they had them watch a horror movie,
p246
aVand then they had them describe their feelings toward their wives.
p247
aVAnd the brain scans were identical in both activities.
p248
aVIt was just sheer terror.
p249
aVSo me talking about emotion
p250
aVis like Gandhi talking about gluttony,
p251
aVbut it is the central organizing process
p252
aVof the way we think.
p253
aVIt tells us what to imprint.
p254
aVThe brain is the record of the feelings of a life.
p255
aa(lp256
VAnd the third insight
p257
aVis that we're not primarily self-contained individuals.
p258
aVWe're social animals, not rational animals.
p259
aVWe emerge out of relationships,
p260
aVand we are deeply interpenetrated, one with another.
p261
aVAnd so when we see another person,
p262
aVwe reenact in our own minds
p263
aVwhat we see in their minds.
p264
aVWhen we watch a car chase in a movie,
p265
aVit's almost as if we are subtly having a car chase.
p266
aVWhen we watch pornography,
p267
aVit's a little like having sex,
p268
aVthough probably not as good.
p269
aVAnd we see this when lovers walk down the street,
p270
aVwhen a crowd in Egypt or Tunisia
p271
aVgets caught up in an emotional contagion,
p272
aVthe deep interpenetration.
p273
aVAnd this revolution in who we are
p274
aVgives us a different way of seeing, I think, politics,
p275
aVa different way, most importantly,
p276
aVof seeing human capital.
p277
aa(lp278
VWe are now children of the French Enlightenment.
p279
aVWe believe that reason is the highest of the faculties.
p280
aVBut I think this research shows
p281
aVthat the British Enlightenment, or the Scottish Enlightenment,
p282
aVwith David Hume, Adam Smith,
p283
aVactually had a better handle on who we are \u2014
p284
aVthat reason is often weak, our sentiments are strong,
p285
aVand our sentiments are often trustworthy.
p286
aVAnd this work corrects that bias in our culture,
p287
aVthat dehumanizing bias.
p288
aVIt gives us a deeper sense
p289
aVof what it actually takes
p290
aVfor us to thrive in this life.
p291
aVWhen we think about human capital
p292
aVwe think about the things we can measure easily \u2014
p293
aVthings like grades, SAT's, degrees,
p294
aVthe number of years in schooling.
p295
aVWhat it really takes to do well, to lead a meaningful life,
p296
aVare things that are deeper,
p297
aVthings we don't really even have words for.
p298
aVAnd so let me list just a couple of the things
p299
aVI think this research points us toward trying to understand.
p300
aa(lp301
VThe first gift, or talent, is mindsight \u2014
p302
aVthe ability to enter into other people's minds
p303
aVand learn what they have to offer.
p304
aVBabies come with this ability.
p305
aVMeltzoff, who's at the University of Washington,
p306
aVleaned over a baby who was 43 minutes old.
p307
aVHe wagged his tongue at the baby.
p308
aVThe baby wagged her tongue back.
p309
aVBabies are born to interpenetrate into Mom's mind
p310
aVand to download what they find \u2014
p311
aVtheir models of how to understand reality.
p312
aVIn the United States, 55 percent of babies
p313
aVhave a deep two-way conversation with Mom
p314
aVand they learn models to how to relate to other people.
p315
aVAnd those people who have models of how to relate
p316
aVhave a huge head start in life.
p317
aVScientists at the University of Minnesota did a study
p318
aVin which they could predict
p319
aVwith 77 percent accuracy, at age 18 months,
p320
aVwho was going to graduate from high school,
p321
aVbased on who had good attachment with mom.
p322
aVTwenty percent of kids do not have those relationships.
p323
aVThey are what we call avoidantly attached.
p324
aVThey have trouble relating to other people.
p325
aVThey go through life
p326
aVlike sailboats tacking into the wind \u2014
p327
aVwanting to get close to people,
p328
aVbut not really having the models of how to do that.
p329
aVAnd so this is one skill
p330
aVof how to hoover up knowledge, one from another.
p331
aa(lp332
VA second skill is equipoise,
p333
aVthe ability to have the serenity
p334
aVto read the biases and failures in your own mind.
p335
aVSo for example, we are overconfidence machines.
p336
aVNinety-five percent of our professors report
p337
aVthat they are above-average teachers.
p338
aVNinety-six percent of college students
p339
aVsay they have above-average social skills.
p340
aVTime magazine asked Americans, "Are you in the top one percent of earners?"
p341
aVNineteen percent of Americans are in the top one percent of earners.
p342
aV(Laughter)
p343
aVThis is a gender-linked trait, by the way.
p344
aVMen drown at twice the rate of women,
p345
aVbecause men think they can swim across that lake.
p346
aVBut some people have the ability and awareness
p347
aVof their own biases, their own overconfidence.
p348
aVThey have epistemological modesty.
p349
aVThey are open-minded in the face of ambiguity.
p350
aVThey are able to adjust strength of the conclusions
p351
aVto the strength of their evidence.
p352
aVThey are curious.
p353
aVAnd these traits are often unrelated and uncorrelated with IQ.
p354
aa(lp355
VThe third trait is metis,
p356
aVwhat we might call street smarts \u2014 it's a Greek word.
p357
aVIt's a sensitivity to the physical environment,
p358
aVthe ability to pick out patterns in an environment \u2014
p359
aVderive a gist.
p360
aVOne of my colleagues at the Times
p361
aVdid a great story about soldiers in Iraq
p362
aVwho could look down a street and detect somehow
p363
aVwhether there was an IED, a landmine, in the street.
p364
aVThey couldn't tell you how they did it,
p365
aVbut they could feel cold, they felt a coldness,
p366
aVand they were more often right than wrong.
p367
aVThe third is what you might call sympathy,
p368
aVthe ability to work within groups.
p369
aVAnd that comes in tremendously handy,
p370
aVbecause groups are smarter than individuals.
p371
aVAnd face-to-face groups are much smarter
p372
aVthan groups that communicate electronically,
p373
aVbecause 90 percent of our communication is non-verbal.
p374
aVAnd the effectiveness of a group
p375
aVis not determined by the IQ of the group;
p376
aVit's determined by how well they communicate,
p377
aVhow often they take turns in conversation.
p378
aa(lp379
VThen you could talk about a trait like blending.
p380
aVAny child can say, "I'm a tiger," pretend to be a tiger.
p381
aVIt seems so elementary.
p382
aVBut in fact, it's phenomenally complicated
p383
aVto take a concept "I" and a concept "tiger"
p384
aVand blend them together.
p385
aVBut this is the source of innovation.
p386
aVWhat Picasso did, for example,
p387
aVwas take the concept "Western art"
p388
aVand the concept "African masks"
p389
aVand blend them together \u2014
p390
aVnot only the geometry,
p391
aVbut the moral systems entailed in them.
p392
aVAnd these are skills, again, we can't count and measure.
p393
aa(lp394
VAnd then the final thing I'll mention
p395
aVis something you might call limerence.
p396
aVAnd this is not an ability;
p397
aVit's a drive and a motivation.
p398
aVThe conscious mind hungers for success and prestige.
p399
aVThe unconscious mind hungers
p400
aVfor those moments of transcendence,
p401
aVwhen the skull line disappears
p402
aVand we are lost in a challenge or a task \u2014
p403
aVwhen a craftsman feels lost in his craft,
p404
aVwhen a naturalist feels at one with nature,
p405
aVwhen a believer feels at one with God's love.
p406
aVThat is what the unconscious mind hungers for.
p407
aVAnd many of us feel it in love
p408
aVwhen lovers feel fused.
p409
aa(lp410
VAnd one of the most beautiful descriptions
p411
aVI've come across in this research
p412
aVof how minds interpenetrate
p413
aVwas written by a great theorist and scientist
p414
aVnamed Douglas Hofstadter at the University of Indiana.
p415
aVHe was married to a woman named Carol,
p416
aVand they had a wonderful relationship.
p417
aVWhen their kids were five and two,
p418
aVCarol had a stroke and a brain tumor and died suddenly.
p419
aVAnd Hofstadter wrote a book
p420
aVcalled "I Am a Strange Loop."
p421
aVIn the course of that book, he describes a moment \u2014
p422
aVjust months after Carol has died \u2014
p423
aVhe comes across her picture on the mantel,
p424
aVor on a bureau in his bedroom.
p425
aa(lp426
VAnd here's what he wrote:
p427
aV"I looked at her face,
p428
aVand I looked so deeply
p429
aVthat I felt I was behind her eyes.
p430
aVAnd all at once I found myself saying
p431
aVas tears flowed,
p432
aV'That's me. That's me.'
p433
aVAnd those simple words
p434
aVbrought back many thoughts that I had had before,
p435
aVabout the fusion of our souls
p436
aVinto one higher-level entity,
p437
aVabout the fact that at the core of both our souls
p438
aVlay our identical hopes and dreams for our children,
p439
aVabout the notion that those hopes
p440
aVwere not separate or distinct hopes,
p441
aVbut were just one hope,
p442
aVone clear thing that defined us both,
p443
aVthat welded us into a unit \u2014
p444
aVthe kind of unit I had but dimly imagined
p445
aVbefore being married and having children.
p446
aVI realized that, though Carol had died,
p447
aVthat core piece of her had not died at all,
p448
aVbut had lived on very determinedly in my brain."
p449
aa(lp450
VThe Greeks say we suffer our way to wisdom.
