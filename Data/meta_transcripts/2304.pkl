VIn 2012, when I painted the minaret of Jara Mosque
p4
aVin my hometown of Gabés, in the south of Tunisia,
p5
aVI never thought that graffiti would bring so much attention to a city.
p6
aa(lp7
VAt the beginning, I was just looking for a wall in my hometown,
p8
aVand it happened that the minaret was built in '94.
p9
aVAnd for 18 years, those 57 meters of concrete stayed grey.
p10
aVWhen I met the imam for the first time, and I told him what I wanted to do,
p11
aVhe was like, "Thank God you finally came,"
p12
aVand he told me that for years he was waiting for somebody
p13
aVto do something on it.
p14
aVThe most amazing thing about this imam is that he didn't ask me anything \u2014
p15
aVneither a sketch, or what I was going to write.
p16
aa(lp17
VIn every work that I create, I write messages
p18
aVwith my style of calligraffiti \u2014 a mix of calligraphy and graffiti.
p19
aVI use quotes or poetry.
p20
aVFor the minaret, I thought that the most relevant message
p21
aVto be put on a mosque should come from the Quran,
p22
aVso I picked this verse:
p23
aV"Oh humankind, we have created you from a male and a female,
p24
aVand made you people and tribe, so you may know each other."
p25
aVIt was a universal call for peace, tolerance, and acceptance
p26
aVcoming from the side that we don't usually portray in a good way in the media.
p27
aa(lp28
VI was amazed to see how the local community reacted to the painting,
p29
aVand how it made them proud to see the minaret getting so much attention
p30
aVfrom international press all around the world.
p31
aVFor the imam, it was not just the painting;
p32
aVit was really deeper than that.
p33
aVHe hoped that this minaret would become a monument for the city,
p34
aVand attract people to this forgotten place of Tunisia.
p35
aVThe universality of the message,
p36
aVthe political context of Tunisia at this time,
p37
aVand the fact that I was writing Quran in a graffiti way
p38
aVwere not insignificant.
p39
aVIt reunited the community.
p40
aa(lp41
VBringing people, future generations,
p42
aVtogether through Arabic calligraphy
p43
aVis what I do.
p44
aVWriting messages is the essence of my artwork.
p45
aVWhat is funny, actually, is that even Arabic-speaking people
p46
aVreally need to focus a lot to decipher what I'm writing.
p47
aVYou don't need to know the meaning to feel the piece.
p48
aVI think that Arabic script touches your soul before it reaches your eyes.
p49
aVThere is a beauty in it that you don't need to translate.
p50
aVArabic script speaks to anyone, I believe;
p51
aVto you, to you, to you, to anybody,
p52
aVand then when you get the meaning,
p53
aVyou feel connected to it.
p54
aVI always make sure to write messages
p55
aVthat are relevant to the place where I'm painting,
p56
aVbut messages that have a universal dimension,
p57
aVso anybody around the world can connect to it.
p58
aa(lp59
VI was born and raised in France, in Paris,
p60
aVand I started learning how to write and read Arabic when I was 18.
p61
aVToday I only write messages in Arabic.
p62
aVOne of the reasons this is so important to me,
p63
aVis because of all the reaction that I've experienced all around the world.
p64
aa(lp65
VIn Rio de Janeiro, I translated this Portuguese poem
p66
aVfrom Gabriela Tôrres Barbosa,
p67
aVwho was giving an homage to the poor people of the favela,
p68
aVand then I painted it on the rooftop.
p69
aVThe local community were really intrigued by what I was doing,
p70
aVbut as soon as I gave them the meaning of the calligraphy,
p71
aVthey thanked me, as they felt connected to the piece.
p72
aa(lp73
VIn South Africa, in Cape Town,
p74
aVthe local community of Philippi
p75
aVoffered me the only concrete wall of the slum.
p76
aVIt was a school, and I wrote on it
p77
aVa quote from Nelson Mandela,
p78
aVsaying, "[in Arabic],"
p79
aVwhich means, "It seems impossible until it's done."
p80
aVThen this guy came to me and said, "Man, why you don't write in English?"
p81
aVand I replied to him, "I would consider your concern legit if you asked me
p82
aVwhy I didn't write in Zulu."
p83
aa(lp84
VIn Paris, once, there was this event,
p85
aVand someone gave his wall to be painted.
p86
aVAnd when he saw I was painting in Arabic,
p87
aVhe got so mad \u2014 actually, hysterical \u2014 and he asked for the wall to be erased.
p88
aVI was mad and disappointed.
p89
aVBut a week later, the organizer of the event asked me to come back,
p90
aVand he told me that there was a wall right in front of this guy's house.
p91
aVSo, this guy \u2014
p92
aV(Laughter)
p93
aVlike, was forced to see it every day.
p94
aVAt the beginning, I was going to write, "[In Arabic],"
p95
aVwhich means, "In your face," but \u2014
p96
aV(Laughter)
p97
aVI decided to be smarter and I wrote, "[In Arabic],"
p98
aVwhich means, "Open your heart."
p99
aa(lp100
VI'm really proud of my culture,
p101
aVand I'm trying to be an ambassador of it through my artwork.
p102
aVAnd I hope that I can break the stereotypes we all know,
p103
aVwith the beauty of Arabic script.
p104
aVToday, I don't write the translation of the message anymore on the wall.
p105
aVI don't want the poetry of the calligraphy to be broken,
p106
aVas it's art and you can appreciate it without knowing the meaning,
p107
aVas you can enjoy any music from other countries.
p108
aVSome people see that as a rejection or a closed door,
p109
aVbut for me, it's more an invitation \u2014
p110
aVto my language, to my culture, and to my art.
p111
aa(lp112
VThank you.
