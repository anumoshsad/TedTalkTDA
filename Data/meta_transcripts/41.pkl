(lp3
VI've been at MIT for 44 years.
p4
aVI went to TED I.
p5
aVThere's only one other person here, I think, who did that.
p6
aVAll the other TEDs \u2014
p7
aVand I went to them all, under Ricky's regime \u2014
p8
aVI talked about what the Media Lab was doing,
p9
aVwhich today has almost 500 people in it.
p10
aa(lp11
VAnd if you read the press,
p12
aVlast week it actually said I quit the Media Lab.
p13
aVI didn't quit the Media Lab, I stepped down as chairman \u2014
p14
aVwhich was a kind of ridiculous title, but someone else has taken it on \u2014
p15
aVand one of the things you can do as a professor
p16
aVis you stay on as a professor.
p17
aVAnd I will now do for the rest of my life the One Laptop Per Child,
p18
aVwhich I've sort of been doing for a year and a half, anyway.
p19
aVSo I'm going to tell you about this,
p20
aVuse my 18 minutes to tell you why we're doing it,
p21
aVhow we're doing it and then what we're doing.
p22
aVAnd at some point I'll even pass around
p23
aVwhat the $100 laptop might be like.
p24
aa(lp25
VI was asked by Chris to talk about some of the big issues,
p26
aVand so I figured I'd start with the three that at least drove me to do this.
p27
aVAnd the first is pretty obvious.
p28
aVIt's amazing when you meet a head of state, and you say,
p29
aV"What is your most precious natural resource?"
p30
aVThey will not say "children" at first,
p31
aVand then when you say, "children," they will pretty quickly agree with you.
p32
aVAnd so that isn't very hard.
p33
aa(lp34
V(Laughter)
p35
aa(lp36
VEverybody agrees that whatever the solutions are to the big problems,
p37
aVthey include education, sometimes can be just education
p38
aVand can never be without some element of education.
p39
aVSo that's certainly part of it.
p40
aa(lp41
VAnd the third is a little bit less obvious.
p42
aVAnd that is that we all in this room learned how to walk, how to talk,
p43
aVnot by being taught how to talk, or taught how to walk,
p44
aVbut by interacting with the world,
p45
aVby having certain results as a consequence of being able to ask for something,
p46
aVor being able to stand up and reach it.
p47
aVWhereas at about the age six, we were told to stop learning that way,
p48
aVand that all learning from then on would happen through teaching,
p49
aVwhether it's people standing up, like I'm doing now,
p50
aVor a book, or something.
p51
aVBut it was really through teaching.
p52
aVAnd one of the things in general that computers have provided to learning
p53
aVis that it now includes a kind of learning
p54
aVwhich is a little bit more like walking and talking,
p55
aVin the sense that a lot of it is driven by the learner himself or herself.
p56
aa(lp57
VSo with those as the principles \u2014
p58
aVsome of you may know Seymour Papert.
p59
aVThis is back in 1982, when we were working in Senegal.
p60
aVBecause some people think that the $100 laptop just happened a year ago,
p61
aVor two years ago, or we were struck by lightning \u2014
p62
aVthis actually has gone back a long time, and in fact, back to the '60s.
p63
aVHere we're in the '80s.
p64
aVSteve Jobs had given us some laptops. We were in Senegal.
p65
aVIt didn't scale
p66
aVbut it at least was bringing computers to developing countries
p67
aVand learning pretty quickly that these kids,
p68
aVeven though English wasn't their language,
p69
aVthe Latin alphabet barely was their language,
p70
aVbut they could just swim like fish.
p71
aVThey could play these like pianos.
p72
aa(lp73
VA little bit more recently, I got involved personally.
p74
aVAnd these are two anecdotes \u2014
p75
aVone was in Cambodia,
p76
aVin a village that has no electricity, no water, no television, no telephone,
p77
aVbut has broadband Internet now.
p78
aVAnd these kids, their first English word is "Google"
p79
aVand they only know Skype.
p80
aVThey've never heard of telephony.
p81
aVThey just use Skype.
p82
aVAnd they go home at night \u2014
p83
aVthey've got a broadband connection in a hut that doesn't have electricity.
p84
aVThe parents love it, because when they open up the laptops,
p85
aVit's the brightest light source in the house.
p86
aVAnd talk about where metaphors and reality mix \u2014
p87
aVthis is the actual school.
p88
aa(lp89
VIn parallel with this, Seymour Papert got the governor of Maine
p90
aVto legislate one laptop per child in the year 2002.
p91
aVNow at the time, I think it's fair to say that 80 percent of the teachers were \u2014
p92
aVlet me say, apprehensive.
p93
aVReally, they were actually against it.
p94
aVAnd they really preferred that the money would be used
p95
aVfor higher salaries, more schools, whatever.
p96
aa(lp97
VAnd now, three and a half years later, guess what?
p98
aVThey're reporting five things: drop of truancy to almost zero,
p99
aVattending parent-teacher meetings \u2014
p100
aVwhich nobody did and now almost everybody does \u2014
p101
aVdrop in discipline problems, increase in student participation.
p102
aVTeachers are now saying it's kind of fun to teach.
p103
aVKids are engaged \u2014 they have laptops! \u2014
p104
aVand then the fifth, which interests me the most,
p105
aVis that the servers have to be turned off at certain times at night
p106
aVbecause the teachers are getting too much email
p107
aVfrom the kids asking them for help.
p108
aVSo when you see that kind of thing \u2014
p109
aVthis is not something that you have to test.
p110
aVThe days of pilot projects are over, when people say,
p111
aV"We'd like to do three or four thousand in our country to see how it works."
p112
aVScrew you. Go to the back of the line and someone else will do it,
p113
aVand then when you figure out that this works, you can join as well.
p114
aVAnd this is what we're doing.
p115
aa(lp116
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p117
aa(lp118
VSo, One Laptop Per Child was formed about a year and a half ago.
p119
aVIt's a nonprofit association.
p120
aVIt raised about 20 million dollars
p121
aVto do the engineering to just get this built,
p122
aVand then have it produced afterwards.
p123
aVScale is truly important.
p124
aVAnd it's not important because you can buy components at a lower price, OK?
p125
aVIt's because you can go to a manufacturer \u2014
p126
aVand I will leave the name out \u2014
p127
aVbut we wanted a small display,
p128
aVdoesn't have to have perfect color uniformity.
p129
aVIt can even have a pixel or two missing.
p130
aVIt doesn't have to be that bright.
p131
aVAnd this particular manufacturer said,
p132
aV"We're not interested in that. We're interested in the living room.
p133
aVWe're interested in perfect color uniformity.
p134
aVWe're interested in big displays, bright displays.
p135
aVYou're not part of our strategic plan."
p136
aVAnd I said, "That's kind of too bad, because we need 100 million units a year."
p137
aa(lp138
V(Laughter)
p139
aa(lp140
VAnd they said, "Oh, well, maybe we could become part of your strategic plan."
p141
aVAnd that's why scale counts.
p142
aVAnd that's why we will not launch this
p143
aVwithout five to 10 million units in the first run.
p144
aVAnd the idea is to launch with enough scale
p145
aVthat the scale itself helps bring the price down,
p146
aVand that's why I said seven to 10 million there.
p147
aVAnd we're doing it without a sales-and-marketing team.
p148
aVI mean, you're looking at the sales-and-marketing team.
p149
aVWe will do it by going to seven large countries
p150
aVand getting them to agree and launch it,
p151
aVand then the others can follow.
p152
aVWe have partners.
p153
aVIt's not hard to guess Google would be one.
p154
aVThe others are all playing to pending.
p155
aVAnd this has been in the press a great deal.
p156
aVIt's the so-called Green Machine that we introduced with Kofi Annan
p157
aVin November at the World Summit that was held in Tunisia.
p158
aa(lp159
VNow once people start looking at this, they say, "Ah, this is a laptop project."
p160
aVWell, no, it's not a laptop project. It's an education project.
p161
aVAnd the fun part \u2014 and I'm quite focused on it \u2014
p162
aVI tell people I used to be a light bulb, but now I'm a laser \u2014
p163
aVI'm just going to get that thing built, and it turns out it's not so hard.
p164
aVBecause laptop economics are the following:
p165
aVI say 50 percent here \u2014 it's more like 60,
p166
aV60 percent of the cost of your laptop
p167
aVis sales, marketing, distribution and profit.
p168
aVNow we have none of those, OK?
p169
aVNone of those figure into our cost,
p170
aVbecause first of all, we sell it at cost, and the governments distribute it.
p171
aVIt gets distributed to the school system like a textbook.
p172
aVSo that piece disappears.
p173
aVThen you have display and everything else.
p174
aVNow the display on your laptop costs,
p175
aVin rough numbers, 10 dollars a diagonal inch.
p176
aVThat can drop to eight; it can drop to seven
p177
aVbut it's not going to drop to two, or to one and a half,
p178
aVunless we do some pretty clever things.
p179
aVIt's the rest \u2014 that little brown box \u2014 that is pretty fascinating,
p180
aVbecause the rest of your laptop is devoted to itself.
p181
aVIt's a little bit like an obese person
p182
aVhaving to use most of their energy to move their obesity.
p183
aa(lp184
V(Laughter)
p185
aa(lp186
VAnd we have a situation today which is incredible.
p187
aVI've been using laptops since their inception.
p188
aVAnd my laptop runs slower, less reliably and less pleasantly
p189
aVthan it ever has before.
p190
aVAnd this year is worse.
p191
aa(lp192
V(Applause)
p193
aa(lp194
VPeople clap, sometimes you even get standing ovations,
p195
aVand I say, "What the hell's wrong with you? Why are we all sitting there?"
p196
aVAnd somebody \u2014 to remain nameless \u2014 called our laptop a "gadget" recently.
p197
aVAnd I said, "God, our laptop's going to go like a bat out of hell.
p198
aVWhen you open it up, it's going to go 'bing.'"
p199
aVIt'll be on.
p200
aVIt'll be just like it was in 1985,
p201
aVwhen you bought an Apple Macintosh 512.
p202
aVIt worked really well.
p203
aVAnd we've been going steadily downhill.
p204
aa(lp205
VNow, people ask all the time what it is.
p206
aVThat's what it is.
p207
aVThe two pieces that are probably notable: it'll be a mesh network,
p208
aVso when the kids open up their laptops, they all become a network,
p209
aVand then just need one or two points of backhaul.
p210
aVYou can serve a couple of thousand kids with two megabits.
p211
aVSo you really can bring into a village,
p212
aVand then the villages can connect themselves,
p213
aVand you really can do it quite well.
p214
aa(lp215
VThe dual mode display \u2014
p216
aVthe idea is to have a display that both works outdoors \u2014
p217
aVisn't it fun using your cell phone outdoors in the sunlight?
p218
aVWell, you can't see it.
p219
aVAnd one of the reasons you can't see it
p220
aVis because it's backlighting most of the time, most cell phones.
p221
aVNow, what we're doing is, we're doing one that will be both frontlit and backlit.
p222
aVAnd whether you manually switch it or you do it in the software
p223
aVis to be seen.
p224
aVBut when it's backlit, it's color.
p225
aVAnd when it's frontlit, it's black and white
p226
aVat three times the resolution.
p227
aa(lp228
VIs it all worked out? No.
p229
aVThat's why a lot of our people are more or less living in Taiwan right now.
p230
aVAnd in about 30 days, we'll know for sure whether this works.
p231
aVProbably the most important piece there
p232
aVis that the kids really can do the maintenance.
p233
aVAnd this is again something that people don't believe,
p234
aVbut I really think it's quite true.
p235
aVThat's the machine we showed in Tunis.
p236
aVThis is more the direction that we're going to go.
p237
aVAnd it's something that we didn't think was possible.
p238
aVNow, I'm going to pass this around.
p239
aVThis isn't a design, OK?
p240
aVSo this is just a mechanical engineering sort of embodiment of it
p241
aVfor you to play with.
p242
aVAnd it's clearly just a model.
p243
aVThe working one is at MIT.
p244
aVI'm going to pass it to this handsome gentleman.
p245
aVAt least you can decide whether it goes left or \u2014
p246
aa(lp247
VChris Anderson: Before you do it, for the people down in simulcast \u2014
p248
aa(lp249
VNicholas Negroponte: Sorry! I forgot. CA: Just show it off a bit.
p250
aa(lp251
VSo wherever the camera is \u2014 OK, good point. Thank you, Chris.
p252
aa(lp253
VThe idea was that it would be not only a laptop,
p254
aVbut that it could transform into an electronic book.
p255
aVSo it's sort of an electronic book.
p256
aVThis is where when you go outside, it's in black and white.
p257
aVThe games buttons are missing,
p258
aVbut it'll also be a games machine,
p259
aVbook machine.
p260
aVSet it up this way, and it's a television set.
p261
aVEtc., etc. \u2014 is that enough for simulcast? OK, sorry.
p262
aVI'll let Jim decide which way to send it afterwards.
p263
aVOK. Seven countries.
p264
aa(lp265
V(Laughter)
p266
aa(lp267
VI say "maybe" for Massachusetts, because they actually have to do a bid.
p268
aVBy law you've got to bid, and so on and so forth.
p269
aVSo I can't quite name them.
p270
aVIn the other cases, they don't have to do bids.
p271
aVThey can decide \u2014
p272
aVit's the federal government in each case.
p273
aVIt's kind of agonizing,
p274
aVbecause a lot of people say, "Let's do it at the state level,"
p275
aVbecause states are more nimble than the feds, just because of size.
p276
aVAnd yet we count.
p277
aVWe're really dealing with the federal government.
p278
aVWe're really dealing with ministries of education.
p279
aVAnd if you look at governments around the world,
p280
aVministries of education tend to be the most conservative,
p281
aVand also the ones that have huge payrolls.
p282
aVEverybody thinks they know about education,
p283
aVa lot of culture is built into it as well.
p284
aVIt's really hard. And so it's certainly the hard road.
p285
aVIf you look at the countries, they're pretty geoculturally distributed.
p286
aa(lp287
VHave they all agreed? No, not completely.
p288
aVProbably Thailand, Brazil and Nigeria
p289
aVare the three that are the most active and most agreed.
p290
aVWe're purposely not signing anything with anybody
p291
aVuntil we actually have the working ones.
p292
aVAnd since I visit each one of those countries
p293
aVwithin at least every three months,
p294
aVI'm just going around the world every three weeks.
p295
aVHere's sort of the schedule
p296
aVand I put at the bottom we might give some away free in two years at this meeting.
p297
aVEverybody says it's a $100 laptop \u2014
p298
aVyou can't do it.
p299
aVWell, guess what, we're not.
p300
aVWe're coming in probably at 135, to start, then drift down.
p301
aVAnd that's very important,
p302
aVbecause so many things hit the market at a price and then drift up.
p303
aVIt's kind of the loss leader,
p304
aVand then as soon as it looks interesting,
p305
aVit can't be afforded, or it can't be scaled out.
p306
aVSo we're targeting 50 dollars in 2010.
p307
aa(lp308
VThe gray market's a big issue.
p309
aVAnd one of the ways \u2014 just one \u2014
p310
aVbut one of the ways to help in the case of the gray market
p311
aVis to make something that is so utterly unique \u2014
p312
aVIt's a little bit like the fact that automobiles \u2014
p313
aVthousands of automobiles are stolen every day in the United States.
p314
aVNot one single post-office truck is stolen.
p315
aa(lp316
V(Laughter)
p317
aa(lp318
VAnd why?
p319
aVBecause there's no market for post-office trucks.
p320
aVIt looks like a post-office truck.
p321
aVYou can spray paint it. You can do anything you want.
p322
aVI just learned recently: in South Africa, no white Volvos are stolen.
p323
aVPeriod. None. Zero.
p324
aVSo we want to make it very much like a white Volvo.
p325
aa(lp326
VEach government has a task force.
p327
aVThis perhaps is less interesting,
p328
aVbut we're trying to get the governments to all work together
p329
aVand it's not easy.
p330
aVThe economics of this is to start with the federal governments
p331
aVand then later, to subsequently go to other \u2014
p332
aVwhether it's child-to-child funding,
p333
aVso a child in this country buys one for a child in the developing world,
p334
aVmaybe of the same gender, maybe of the same age.
p335
aVAn uncle gives a niece or a nephew that as a birthday present.
p336
aVI mean, there are all sorts of things that will happen,
p337
aVand they'll be very, very exciting.
p338
aa(lp339
VAnd everybody says \u2014 I say \u2014 it's an education project.
p340
aVAre we providing the software?
p341
aVThe answer is:
p342
aVThe system certainly has software,
p343
aVbut no, we're not providing the education content.
p344
aVThat is really done in the countries.
p345
aVBut we are certainly constructionists.
p346
aVAnd we certainly believe in learning by doing
p347
aVand everything from Logo, which was started in 1968,
p348
aVto more modern things, like Scratch, if you've ever even heard of it,
p349
aVare very, very much part of it.
p350
aVAnd that's the rollout.
p351
aa(lp352
VAre we dreaming? Is this real?
p353
aVIt actually is real.
p354
aVThe only criticism, and people really don't want to criticize this,
p355
aVbecause it is a humanitarian effort, a nonprofit effort
p356
aVand to criticize it is a little bit stupid, actually.
p357
aa(lp358
V(Laughter)
p359
aa(lp360
VBut the one thing that people could criticize was,
p361
aV"Great idea, but these guys can't do it."
p362
aVAnd that could either mean these guys, professors and so on couldn't do it,
p363
aVor that it's not possible.
p364
aVWell, on December 12, a company called Quanta agreed to build it,
p365
aVand since they make about one-third of all the laptops on the planet today,
p366
aVthat question disappeared.
p367
aVSo it's not a matter of whether it's going to happen.
p368
aVIt is going to happen.
p369
aVAnd if it comes out at 138 dollars, so what?
p370
aVIf it comes out six months late, so what?
p371
aVThat's a pretty soft landing.
p372
aa(lp373
