VI'm afraid I'm one of those speakers
p4
aVyou hope you're not going to meet at TED.
p5
aVFirst, I don't have a mobile,
p6
aVso I'm on the safe side.
p7
aVSecondly, a political theorist
p8
aVwho's going to talk about the crisis of democracy
p9
aVis probably not the most exciting topic you can think about.
p10
aVAnd plus, I'm not going to give you any answers.
p11
aVI'm much more trying to add to some of the questions we're talking about.
p12
aVAnd one of the things that I want to question
p13
aVis this very popular hope these days
p14
aVthat transparency and openness
p15
aVcan restore the trust in democratic institutions.
p16
aa(lp17
VThere is one more reason for you to be suspicious about me.
p18
aVYou people, the Church of TED, are a very optimistic community.
p19
aV(Laughter)
p20
aVBasically you believe in complexity, but not in ambiguity.
p21
aVAs you have been told, I'm Bulgarian.
p22
aVAnd according to the surveys,
p23
aVwe are marked the most pessimistic people in the world.
p24
aV(Laughter)
p25
aVThe Economist magazine recently wrote an article
p26
aVcovering one of the recent studies on happiness,
p27
aVand the title was "The Happy, the Unhappy and the Bulgarians."
p28
aa(lp29
V(Laughter)
p30
aa(lp31
VSo now when you know what to expect,
p32
aVlet's give you the story.
p33
aVAnd this is a rainy election day in a small country \u2014
p34
aVthat can be my country, but could be also your country.
p35
aVAnd because of the rain until four o'clock in the afternoon,
p36
aVnobody went to the polling stations.
p37
aVBut then the rain stopped,
p38
aVpeople went to vote.
p39
aVAnd when the votes had been counted,
p40
aVthree-fourths of the people have voted with a blank ballot.
p41
aVThe government and the opposition,
p42
aVthey have been simply paralyzed.
p43
aVBecause you know what to do about the protests.
p44
aVYou know who to arrest, who to negotiate with.
p45
aVBut what to do about people who are voting with a blank ballot?
p46
aVSo the government decided to have the elections once again.
p47
aVAnd this time even a greater number,
p48
aV83 percent of the people, voted with blank ballots.
p49
aVBasically they went to the ballot boxes
p50
aVto tell that they have nobody to vote for.
p51
aa(lp52
VThis is the opening of a beautiful novel by Jose Saramago
p53
aVcalled "Seeing."
p54
aVBut in my view it very well captures
p55
aVpart of the problem that we have with democracy in Europe these days.
p56
aVOn one level nobody's questioning
p57
aVthat democracy is the best form of government.
p58
aVDemocracy is the only game in town.
p59
aVThe problem is that many people start to believe
p60
aVthat it is not a game worth playing.
p61
aa(lp62
VFor the last 30 years, political scientists have observed
p63
aVthat there is a constant decline in electoral turnout,
p64
aVand the people who are least interested to vote
p65
aVare the people whom you expect are going to gain most out of voting.
p66
aVI mean the unemployed, the under-privileged.
p67
aVAnd this is a major issue.
p68
aVBecause especially now with the economic crisis,
p69
aVyou can see that the trust in politics,
p70
aVthat the trust in democratic institutions,
p71
aVwas really destroyed.
p72
aVAccording to the latest survey being done by the European Commission,
p73
aV89 percent of the citizens of Europe believe that there is a growing gap
p74
aVbetween the opinion of the policy-makers and the opinion of the public.
p75
aVOnly 18 percent of Italians and 15 percent of Greeks
p76
aVbelieve that their vote matters.
p77
aVBasically people start to understand that they can change governments,
p78
aVbut they cannot change policies.
p79
aa(lp80
VAnd the question which I want to ask is the following:
p81
aVHow did it happen that we are living in societies
p82
aVwhich are much freer than ever before \u2014
p83
aVwe have more rights, we can travel easier,
p84
aVwe have access to more information \u2014
p85
aVat the same time that trust in our democratic institutions
p86
aVbasically has collapsed?
p87
aVSo basically I want to ask:
p88
aVWhat went right and what went wrong in these 50 years
p89
aVwhen we talk about democracy?
p90
aVAnd I'll start with what went right.
p91
aa(lp92
VAnd the first thing that went right was, of course,
p93
aVthese five revolutions which, in my view,
p94
aVvery much changed the way we're living and deepened our democratic experience.
p95
aVAnd the first was the cultural and social revolution of 1968 and 1970s,
p96
aVwhich put the individual at the center of politics.
p97
aVIt was the human rights moment.
p98
aVBasically this was also a major outbreak, a culture of dissent,
p99
aVa culture of basically non-conformism,
p100
aVwhich was not known before.
p101
aVSo I do believe that even things like that
p102
aVare very much the children of '68 \u2014
p103
aVnevertheless that most of us had been even not born then.
p104
aVBut after that you have the market revolution of the 1980s.
p105
aVAnd nevertheless that many people on the left try to hate it,
p106
aVthe truth is that it was very much the market revolution that sent the message:
p107
aV"The government does not know better."
p108
aVAnd you have more choice-driven societies.
p109
aVAnd of course, you have 1989 \u2014 the end of Communism, the end of the Cold War.
p110
aVAnd it was the birth of the global world.
p111
aVAnd you have the Internet.
p112
aVAnd this is not the audience to which I'm going to preach
p113
aVto what extent the Internet empowered people.
p114
aVIt has changed the way we are communicating
p115
aVand basically we are viewing politics.
p116
aVThe very idea of political community totally has changed.
p117
aVAnd I'm going to name one more revolution,
p118
aVand this is the revolution in brain sciences,
p119
aVwhich totally changed the way
p120
aVwe understand how people are making decisions.
p121
aa(lp122
VSo this is what went right.
p123
aVBut if we're going to see what went wrong,
p124
aVwe're going to end up with the same five revolutions.
p125
aVBecause first you have the 1960s and 1970s,
p126
aVcultural and social revolution,
p127
aVwhich in a certain way destroyed the idea of a collective purpose.
p128
aVThe very idea, all these collective nouns that we have been taught about \u2014
p129
aVnation, class, family.
p130
aVWe start to like divorcing, if we're married at all.
p131
aVAll this was very much under attack.
p132
aVAnd it is so difficult to engage people in politics
p133
aVwhen they believe that what really matters
p134
aVis where they personally stand.
p135
aa(lp136
VAnd you have the market revolution of the 1980s
p137
aVand the huge increase of inequality in societies.
p138
aVRemember, until the 1970s,
p139
aVthe spread of democracy has always been accompanied
p140
aVby the decline of inequality.
p141
aVThe more democratic our societies have been,
p142
aVthe more equal they have been becoming.
p143
aVNow we have the reverse tendency.
p144
aVThe spread of democracy now is very much accompanied
p145
aVby the increase in inequality.
p146
aVAnd I find this very much disturbing
p147
aVwhen we're talking about what's going on right and wrong
p148
aVwith democracy these days.
p149
aa(lp150
VAnd if you go to 1989 \u2014
p151
aVsomething that basically you don't expect that anybody's going to criticize \u2014
p152
aVbut many are going to tell you, "Listen, it was the end of the Cold War
p153
aVthat tore the social contract between the elites and the people in Western Europe."
p154
aVWhen the Soviet Union was still there,
p155
aVthe rich and the powerful, they needed the people,
p156
aVbecause they feared them.
p157
aVNow the elites basically have been liberated.
p158
aVThey're very mobile. You cannot tax them.
p159
aVAnd basically they don't fear the people.
p160
aVSo as a result of it, you have this very strange situation
p161
aVin which the elites basically got out of the control of the voters.
p162
aVSo this is not by accident
p163
aVthat the voters are not interested to vote anymore.
p164
aa(lp165
VAnd when we talk about the Internet,
p166
aVyes, it's true, the Internet connected all of us,
p167
aVbut we also know that the Internet created these echo chambers and political ghettos
p168
aVin which for all your life you can stay with the political community you belong to.
p169
aVAnd it's becoming more and more difficult
p170
aVto understand the people who are not like you.
p171
aVI know that many people here
p172
aVhave been splendidly speaking about the digital world and the possibility for cooperation,
p173
aVbut [have you] seen what the digital world has done to American politics these days?
p174
aVThis is also partly a result of the Internet revolution.
p175
aVThis is the other side of the things that we like.
p176
aa(lp177
VAnd when you go to the brain sciences,
p178
aVwhat political consultants learned from the brain scientists
p179
aVis don't talk to me about ideas anymore,
p180
aVdon't talk to me about policy programs.
p181
aVWhat really matters is basically to manipulate the emotions of the people.
p182
aVAnd you have this very strongly
p183
aVto the extent that, even if you see when we talk about revolutions these days,
p184
aVthese revolutions are not named anymore around ideologies or ideas.
p185
aVBefore, revolutions used to have ideological names.
p186
aVThey could be communist, they could be liberal,
p187
aVthey could be fascist or Islamic.
p188
aVNow the revolutions are called under the medium which is most used.
p189
aVYou have Facebook revolutions, Twitter revolutions.
p190
aVThe content doesn't matter anymore, the problem is the media.
p191
aa(lp192
VI'm saying this because one of my major points
p193
aVis what went right is also what went wrong.
p194
aVAnd when we're now trying to see how we can change the situation,
p195
aVwhen basically we're trying to see what can be done about democracy,
p196
aVwe should keep this ambiguity in mind.
p197
aVBecause probably some of the things that we love most
p198
aVare going to be also the things that can hurt us most.
p199
aVThese days it's very popular to believe
p200
aVthat this push for transparency,
p201
aVthis kind of a combination between active citizens, new technologies
p202
aVand much more transparency-friendly legislation
p203
aVcan restore trust in politics.
p204
aVYou believe that when you have these new technologies and people who are ready to use this,
p205
aVit can make it much more difficult for the governments to lie,
p206
aVit's going to be more difficult for them to steal
p207
aVand probably even going to be more difficult for them to kill.
p208
aVThis is probably true.
p209
aVBut I do believe that we should be also very clear
p210
aVthat now when we put the transparency at the center of politics
p211
aVwhere the message is, "It's transparency, stupid."
p212
aa(lp213
VTransparency is not about restoring trust in institutions.
p214
aVTransparency is politics' management of mistrust.
p215
aVWe are assuming that our societies are going to be based on mistrust.
p216
aVAnd by the way, mistrust was always very important for democracy.
p217
aVThis is why you have checks and balances.
p218
aVThis is why basically you have all this creative mistrust
p219
aVbetween the representatives and those whom they represent.
p220
aVBut when politics is only management of mistrust,
p221
aVthen \u2014 I'm very glad that "1984" has been mentioned \u2014
p222
aVnow we're going to have "1984" in reverse.
p223
aVIt's not going to be the Big Brother watching you,
p224
aVit's going to be we being the Big Brother
p225
aVwatching the political class.
p226
aa(lp227
VBut is this the idea of a free society?
p228
aVFor example, can you imagine
p229
aVthat decent, civic, talented people are going to run for office
p230
aVif they really do believe
p231
aVthat politics is also about managing mistrust?
p232
aVAre you not afraid with all these technologies
p233
aVthat are going to track down
p234
aVany statement the politicians are going to make on certain issues,
p235
aVare you not afraid that this is going to be a very strong signal to politicians
p236
aVto repeat their positions, even the very wrong positions,
p237
aVbecause consistency is going to be more important than common sense?
p238
aVAnd the Americans who are in the room,
p239
aVare you not afraid that your presidents are going to govern
p240
aVon the basis of what they said in the primary elections?
p241
aa(lp242
VI find this extremely important,
p243
aVbecause democracy is about people changing their views
p244
aVbased on rational arguments and discussions.
p245
aVAnd we can lose this with the very noble idea
p246
aVto keep people accountable
p247
aVfor showing the people that we're not going to tolerate
p248
aVpoliticians the opportunism in politics.
p249
aVSo for me this is extremely important.
p250
aVAnd I do believe that when we're discussing politics these days,
p251
aVprobably it makes sense
p252
aVto look also at this type of a story.
p253
aa(lp254
VBut also don't forget, any unveiling is also veiling.
p255
aV[Regardless of] how transparent our governments want to be,
p256
aVthey're going to be selectively transparent.
p257
aVIn a small country that could be my country,
p258
aVbut could be also your country,
p259
aVthey took a decision \u2014 it is a real case story \u2014
p260
aVthat all of the governmental decisions,
p261
aVdiscussions of the council of ministers,
p262
aVwere going to be published on the Internet
p263
aV24 hours after the council discussions took place.
p264
aVAnd the public was extremely all for it.
p265
aVSo I had the opportunity to talk to the prime minister,
p266
aVwhy he made this decision.
p267
aVHe said, "Listen, this is the best way
p268
aVto keep the mouths of my ministers closed.
p269
aVBecause it's going to be very difficult for them to dissent
p270
aVknowing that 24 hours after
p271
aVthis is going to be on the public space,
p272
aVand this is in a certain way going to be a political crisis."
p273
aa(lp274
VSo when we talk about transparency,
p275
aVwhen we talk about openness,
p276
aVI really do believe that what we should keep in mind
p277
aVis that what went right is what went wrong.
p278
aVAnd this is Goethe, who is neither Bulgarian nor a political scientist,
p279
aVsome centuries ago he said,
p280
aV"There is a big shadow where there is much light."
p281
