VI am from the South Side of Chicago,
p4
aVand in seventh grade, I had a best friend named Jenny
p5
aVwho lived on the Southwest Side of Chicago.
p6
aVJenny was white,
p7
aVand if you know anything about the segregated demographics of Chicago,
p8
aVyou know that there are not too many black people
p9
aVwho live on the Southwest Side of Chicago.
p10
aVBut Jenny was my girl
p11
aVand so we would hang out every so often after school and on the weekends.
p12
aVAnd so one day we were hanging out in her living room,
p13
aVtalking about 13-year-old things,
p14
aVand Jenny's little sister Rosie was in the room with us,
p15
aVand she was sitting behind me just kind of playing in my hair,
p16
aVand I wasn't thinking too much about what she was doing.
p17
aVBut at a pause in the conversation,
p18
aVRosie tapped me on the shoulder.
p19
aVShe said, "Can I ask you a question?"
p20
aa(lp21
VI said, "Yeah, Rosie. Sure."
p22
aa(lp23
V"Are you black?"
p24
aa(lp25
V(Laughter)
p26
aa(lp27
VThe room froze.
p28
aVSilence.
p29
aVJenny and Rosie's mom was not too far away.
p30
aVShe was in the kitchen and she overheard the conversation,
p31
aVand she was mortified.
p32
aVShe said, "Rosie! You can't ask people questions like that."
p33
aVAnd Jenny was my friend, and I know she was really embarrassed.
p34
aVI felt kind of bad for her, but actually I was not offended.
p35
aVI figured it wasn't Rosie's fault that in her 10 short years on this earth,
p36
aVliving on the Southwest Side of Chicago,
p37
aVshe wasn't 100 percent sure what a black person looked like.
p38
aVThat's fair.
p39
aVBut what was more surprising to me was,
p40
aVin all of this time I had spent with Jenny and Rosie's family \u2014
p41
aVhanging out with them,
p42
aVplaying with them,
p43
aVeven physically interacting with them \u2014
p44
aVit was not until Rosie put her hands in my hair
p45
aVthat she thought to ask me if I was black.
p46
aVThat was the first time I would realize
p47
aVhow big of a role the texture of my hair played in confirming my ethnicity,
p48
aVbut also that it would play a key role in how I'm viewed by others in society.
p49
aa(lp50
VGarrett A. Morgan and Madame CJ Walker were pioneers
p51
aVof the black hair-care and beauty industry in the early 1900s.
p52
aVThey're best known as the inventors of chemically-based hair creams
p53
aVand heat straightening tools
p54
aVdesigned to permanently, or semipermanently,
p55
aValter the texture of black hair.
p56
aVOftentimes when we think about the history of blacks in America,
p57
aVwe think about the heinous acts
p58
aVand numerous injustices that we experienced as people of color
p59
aVbecause of the color of our skin,
p60
aVwhen in fact, in post-Civil War America,
p61
aVit was the hair of an African-American male or female
p62
aVthat was known as the most "telling feature" of Negro status,
p63
aVmore so than the color of the skin.
p64
aVAnd so before they were staples
p65
aVof the multibillion-dollar hair-care industry,
p66
aVour dependency on tools and products,
p67
aVlike the hair relaxer and the pressing comb,
p68
aVwere more about our survival and advancement as a race
p69
aVin postslavery America.
p70
aa(lp71
VOver the years, we grew accustomed to this idea
p72
aVthat straighter and longer hair meant better and more beautiful.
p73
aVWe became culturally obsessed
p74
aVwith this idea of having what we like to call ...
p75
aV"good hair."
p76
aVThis essentially means:
p77
aVthe looser the curl pattern, the better the hair.
p78
aVAnd we let these institutionalized ideas form a false sense of hierarchy
p79
aVthat would determine what was considered a good grade of hair
p80
aVand what was not.
p81
aVWhat's worse is that we let these false ideologies
p82
aVinvade our perception of ourselves,
p83
aVand they still continue to infect our cultural identity
p84
aVas African-American women today.
p85
aa(lp86
VSo what did we do?
p87
aVWe went to the hair salon every six to eight weeks,
p88
aVwithout fail,
p89
aVto subject our scalps to harsh straightening chemicals
p90
aVbeginning at a very young age \u2014
p91
aVsometimes eight, 10 \u2014
p92
aVthat would result in hair loss,
p93
aVbald spots,
p94
aVsometimes even burns on the scalp.
p95
aVWe fry our hair at temperatures of 450 degrees Fahrenheit or higher
p96
aValmost daily,
p97
aVto maintain the straight look.
p98
aVOr we simply cover our hair up with wigs and weaves,
p99
aVonly to let our roots breathe in private
p100
aVwhere no one knows what's really going on under there.
p101
aa(lp102
VWe adopted these practices in our own communities,
p103
aVand so it's no wonder why today the typical ideal vision
p104
aVof a professional black woman,
p105
aVespecially in corporate America,
p106
aVtends to look like this,
p107
aVrather than like this.
p108
aVAnd she certainly doesn't look like this.
p109
aa(lp110
VIn September of this year,
p111
aVa federal court ruled it lawful
p112
aVfor a company to discriminate against hiring an employee
p113
aVbased on if she or he wears dreadlocks.
p114
aVIn the case,
p115
aVthe hiring manager in Mobile, Alabama
p116
aVis on record as saying,
p117
aV"I'm not saying yours are messy,
p118
aVbut ...
p119
aVyou know what I'm talking about."
p120
aVWell, what was she talking about?
p121
aVDid she think that they were ugly?
p122
aVOr maybe they were just a little too Afrocentric
p123
aVand pro-black-looking for her taste.
p124
aVOr maybe it's not about Afrocentricity,
p125
aVand it's more just about it being a little too "urban"
p126
aVfor the professional setting.
p127
aVPerhaps she had a genuine concern in that they looked "scary"
p128
aVand that they would intimidate the clients and their customer base.
p129
aVAll of these words are ones that are too often associated
p130
aVwith the stigma attached to natural hairstyles.
p131
aVAnd this ...
p132
aVthis has got to change.
p133
aa(lp134
VIn 2013,
p135
aVa white paper published by the Deloitte Leadership Center for Inclusion,
p136
aVstudied 3,000 individuals in executive leadership roles
p137
aVon the concept of covering in the workplace
p138
aVbased on appearance, advocacy, affiliation and association.
p139
aVWhen thinking about appearance-based covering,
p140
aVthe study showed
p141
aVthat 67 percent of women of color cover in the workplace
p142
aVbased on their appearance.
p143
aVOf the total respondents who admitted to appearance-based covering,
p144
aV82 percent said that it was somewhat to extremely important
p145
aVfor them to do so for their professional advancement.
p146
aa(lp147
VNow, this is Ursula Burns.
p148
aVShe is the first African-American female CEO of a Fortune 500 company \u2014
p149
aVof Xerox.
p150
aVShe's known by her signature look,
p151
aVthe one that you see here.
p152
aVA short, nicely trimmed, well-manicured Afro.
p153
aVMs. Burns is what we like to call a "natural girl."
p154
aVAnd she is paving the way and showing what's possible
p155
aVfor African-American women seeking to climb the corporate ladder,
p156
aVbut still wishing to wear natural hairstyles.
p157
aa(lp158
VBut today the majority of African-American women
p159
aVwho we still look to as leaders, icons and role models,
p160
aVstill opt for a straight-hair look.
p161
aVNow,
p162
aVmaybe it's because they want to \u2014
p163
aVthis is authentically how they feel best \u2014
p164
aVbut maybe \u2014
p165
aVand I bet \u2014
p166
aVa part of them felt like they had to
p167
aVin order to reach the level of success that they have attained today.
p168
aa(lp169
VThere is a natural hair movement that is sweeping the country
p170
aVand also in some places in Europe.
p171
aVMillions of women are exploring what it means to transition to natural hair,
p172
aVand they're cutting off years and years of dry, damaged ends
p173
aVin order to restore their natural curl pattern.
p174
aVI know because I have been an advocate and an ambassador for this movement
p175
aVfor roughly the last three years.
p176
aVAfter 27 years of excessive heat and harsh chemicals,
p177
aVmy hair was beginning to show extreme signs of wear and tear.
p178
aVIt was breaking off,
p179
aVit was thinning,
p180
aVlooking just extremely dry and brittle.
p181
aVAll those years of chasing that conventional image of beauty
p182
aVthat we saw earlier
p183
aVwas finally beginning to take its toll.
p184
aVI wanted to do something about it,
p185
aVand so I started what I called the "No Heat Challenge,"
p186
aVwhere I would refrain from using heat styling tools on my hair
p187
aVfor six months.
p188
aVAnd like a good millennial,
p189
aVI documented it on social media.
p190
aa(lp191
V(Laughter)
p192
aa(lp193
VI documented as I reluctantly cut off
p194
aVthree to four inches of my beloved hair.
p195
aVI documented as I struggled to master these natural hairstyles,
p196
aVand also as I struggled to embrace them
p197
aVand think that they actually looked good.
p198
aVAnd I documented as my hair texture slowly began to change.
p199
aa(lp200
VBy sharing this journey openly,
p201
aVI learned that I was not the only woman going through this
p202
aVand that in fact there were thousands and thousands of other women
p203
aVwho were longing to do the same.
p204
aVSo they would reach out to me and they would say,
p205
aV"Cheyenne, how did you do that natural hairstyle
p206
aVthat I saw you with the other day?
p207
aVWhat new products have you started using
p208
aVthat might be a little better for my hair texture
p209
aVas it begins to change?"
p210
aVOr, "What are some of the natural hair routines
p211
aVthat I should begin to adopt to slowly restore the health of my hair?"
p212
aVBut I also found that there were a large number of women
p213
aVwho were extremely hesitant to take that first step
p214
aVbecause they were paralyzed by fear.
p215
aVFear of the unknown \u2014
p216
aVwhat would they now look like?
p217
aVHow would they feel about themselves with these natural hairstyles?
p218
aVAnd most importantly to them,
p219
aVhow would others view them?
p220
aa(lp221
VOver the last three years
p222
aVof having numerous conversations with friends of mine
p223
aVand also complete strangers from around the world,
p224
aVI learned some really important things
p225
aVabout how African-American women identify with their hair.
p226
aVAnd so when I think back
p227
aVto that hiring manager in Mobile, Alabama,
p228
aVI'd say, "Actually, no.
p229
aVWe don't know what you're talking about."
p230
aVBut here are some things that we do know.
p231
aVWe know that when black women embrace their love for their natural hair,
p232
aVit helps to undo generations of teaching
p233
aVthat black in its natural state is not beautiful,
p234
aVor something to be hidden or covered up.
p235
aVWe know that black women express their individuality
p236
aVand experience feelings of empowerment
p237
aVby experimenting with different hairstyles regularly.
p238
aVAnd we also know
p239
aVthat when we're invited to wear our natural hair in the workplace,
p240
aVit reinforces that we are uniquely valued
p241
aVand thus helps us to flourish and advance professionally.
p242
aa(lp243
VI leave you with this.
p244
aVIn a time of racial and social tension,
p245
aVembracing this movement
p246
aVand others like this
p247
aVhelp us to rise above the confines of the status quo.
p248
aVSo when you see a woman with braids or locks draping down her back,
p249
aVor you notice your colleague
p250
aVwho has stopped straightening her hair to work,
p251
aVdo not simply approach her and admire
p252
aVand ask her if you can touch it \u2014
p253
aa(lp254
V(Laughter)
p255
aa(lp256
VReally appreciate her.
p257
aVApplaud her.
p258
aVHeck, even high-five her if that's what you feel so inclined to do.
p259
aVBecause this \u2014
p260
aVthis is more than about a hairstyle.
p261
aVIt's about self-love and self-worth.
p262
aVIt's about being brave enough
p263
aVnot to fold under the pressure of others' expectations.
p264
aVAnd about knowing that making the decision to stray from the norm
p265
aVdoes not define who we are,
p266
aVbut it simply reveals who we are.
p267
aa(lp268
VAnd finally,
p269
aVbeing brave is easier
p270
aVwhen we can count on the compassion of others.
p271
aVSo after today,
p272
aVI certainly hope that we can count on you.
p273
aa(lp274
VThank you.
