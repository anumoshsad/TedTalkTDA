VI am passionate about the American landscape
p4
aVand how the physical form of the land,
p5
aVfrom the great Central Valley of California
p6
aVto the bedrock of Manhattan,
p7
aVhas really shaped our history and our character.
p8
aVBut one thing is clear.
p9
aVIn the last 100 years alone,
p10
aVour country \u2014 and this is a sprawl map of America \u2014
p11
aVour country has systematically
p12
aVflattened and homogenized the landscape
p13
aVto the point where we've forgotten
p14
aVour relationship with the plants and animals
p15
aVthat live alongside us
p16
aVand the dirt beneath our feet.
p17
aVAnd so, how I see my work contributing
p18
aVis sort of trying to literally re-imagine these connections
p19
aVand physically rebuild them.
p20
aVThis graph represents what we're dealing with now
p21
aVin the built environment.
p22
aVAnd it's really a conflux
p23
aVof urban population rising,
p24
aVbiodiversity plummeting
p25
aVand also, of course, sea levels rising
p26
aVand climate changing.
p27
aa(lp28
VSo when I also think about design,
p29
aVI think about
p30
aVtrying to rework and re-engage
p31
aVthe lines on this graph
p32
aVin a more productive way.
p33
aVAnd you can see from the arrow here
p34
aVindicating "you are here,"
p35
aVI'm trying to sort of blend and meld
p36
aVthese two very divergent fields
p37
aVof urbanism and ecology,
p38
aVand sort of bring them together in an exciting new way.
p39
aVSo the era of big infrastructure is over.
p40
aVI mean, these sort of top-down,
p41
aVmono-functional, capital-intensive solutions
p42
aVare really not going to cut it.
p43
aVWe need new tools and new approaches.
p44
aVSimilarly, the idea of architecture
p45
aVas this sort of object in the field,
p46
aVdevoid of context,
p47
aVis really not the \u2014
p48
aVexcuse me, it's fairly blatant \u2014
p49
aVis really not the approach
p50
aVthat we need to take.
p51
aVSo we need new stories,
p52
aVnew heroes and new tools.
p53
aa(lp54
VSo now I want to introduce you to my new hero
p55
aVin the global climate change war,
p56
aVand that is the eastern oyster.
p57
aVSo, albeit a very small creature
p58
aVand very modest,
p59
aVthis creature is incredible,
p60
aVbecause it can agglomerate
p61
aVinto these mega-reef structures.
p62
aVIt can grow; you can grow it;
p63
aVand \u2014 did I mention? \u2014 it's quite tasty.
p64
aVSo the oyster was the basis
p65
aVfor a manifesto-like urban design project
p66
aVthat I did about the New York Harbor
p67
aVcalled "oyster-tecture."
p68
aVAnd the core idea of oyster-tecture is to harness the biological power
p69
aVof mussels, eelgrass and oysters \u2014
p70
aVspecies that live in the harbor \u2014
p71
aVand, at the same time,
p72
aVharness the power of people
p73
aVwho live in the community
p74
aVtowards making change now.
p75
aa(lp76
VHere's a map of my city, New York City,
p77
aVshowing inundation in red.
p78
aVAnd what's circled is the site that I'm going to talk about,
p79
aVthe Gowanus Canal and Governors Island.
p80
aVIf you look here at this map,
p81
aVshowing everything in blue
p82
aVis out in the water,
p83
aVand everything in yellow is upland.
p84
aVBut you can see, even just intuit, from this map,
p85
aVthat the harbor has dredged and flattened,
p86
aVand went from a rich, three-dimensional mosaic to flat muck
p87
aVin really a matter of years.
p88
aVAnother set of views of actually the Gowanus Canal itself.
p89
aVNow the Gowanus is particularly smelly \u2014 I will admit it.
p90
aVThere are problems of sewage overflow
p91
aVand contamination,
p92
aVbut I would also argue that almost every city
p93
aVhas this exact condition,
p94
aVand it's a condition that we're all facing.
p95
aVAnd here's a map of that condition,
p96
aVshowing the contaminants in yellow and green,
p97
aVexacerbated by this new flow of
p98
aVstorm-surge and sea-level rise.
p99
aVSo we really had a lot to deal with.
p100
aa(lp101
VWhen we started this project,
p102
aVone of the core ideas was to look back in history
p103
aVand try to understand what was there.
p104
aVAnd you can see from this map,
p105
aVthere's this incredible geographical signature
p106
aVof a series of islands
p107
aVthat were out in the harbor
p108
aVand a matrix of salt marshes and beaches
p109
aVthat served as natural wave attenuation
p110
aVfor the upland settlement.
p111
aVWe also learned at this time
p112
aVthat you could eat an oyster about the size of a dinner plate
p113
aVin the Gowanus Canal itself.
p114
aVSo our concept is really this back-to-the-future concept,
p115
aVharnessing the intelligence of that land settlement pattern.
p116
aVAnd the idea has two core stages.
p117
aVOne is to develop a new artificial ecology,
p118
aVa reef out in the harbor,
p119
aVthat would then protect new settlement patterns
p120
aVinland and the Gowanus.
p121
aVBecause if you have cleaner water and slower water,
p122
aVyou can imagine a new way of living with that water.
p123
aa(lp124
VSo the project really addresses these three core issues
p125
aVin a new and exciting way, I think.
p126
aVHere we are, back to our hero, the oyster.
p127
aVAnd again, it's this incredibly exciting animal.
p128
aVIt accepts algae and detritus in one end,
p129
aVand through this beautiful, glamorous
p130
aVset of stomach organs,
p131
aVout the other end comes cleaner water.
p132
aVAnd one oyster can filter up to 50 gallons of water a day.
p133
aVOyster reefs also covered
p134
aVabout a quarter of our harbor
p135
aVand were capable of filtering water in the harbor in a matter of days.
p136
aVThey were key in our culture and our economy.
p137
aVBasically, New York was built
p138
aVon the backs of oystermen,
p139
aVand our streets were literally built over oyster shells.
p140
aVThis image
p141
aVis an image of an oyster cart,
p142
aVwhich is now as ubiquitous as the hotdog cart is today.
p143
aVSo again, we got the short end of the deal there.
p144
aV(Laughter)
p145
aVFinally, oysters can attenuate
p146
aVand agglomerate onto each other
p147
aVand form these amazing natural reef structures.
p148
aVThey really become nature's wave attenuators.
p149
aVAnd they become the bedrock
p150
aVof any harbor ecosystem.
p151
aVMany, many species depend on them.
p152
aa(lp153
VSo we were inspired by the oyster,
p154
aVbut I was also inspired by the life cycle of the oyster.
p155
aVIt can move from a fertilized egg
p156
aVto a spat, which is when they're floating through the water,
p157
aVand when they're ready to attach onto another oyster,
p158
aVto an adult male oyster or female oyster,
p159
aVin a number of weeks.
p160
aVWe reinterpreted this life cycle
p161
aVon the scale of our sight
p162
aVand took the Gowanus
p163
aVas a giant oyster nursery
p164
aVwhere oysters would be grown up in the Gowanus,
p165
aVthen paraded down in their spat stage
p166
aVand seeded out on the Bayridge Reef.
p167
aVAnd so the core idea here
p168
aVwas to hit the reset button
p169
aVand regenerate an ecology over time
p170
aVthat was regenerative and cleaning
p171
aVand productive.
p172
aa(lp173
VHow does the reef work? Well, it's very, very simple.
p174
aVA core concept here
p175
aVis that climate change
p176
aVisn't something that \u2014
p177
aVthe answers won't land down from the Moon.
p178
aVAnd with a $20 billion price tag,
p179
aVwe should simply start and get to work with what we have now
p180
aVand what's in front of us.
p181
aVSo this image is simply showing \u2014
p182
aVit's a field of marine piles
p183
aVinterconnected with this woven fuzzy rope.
p184
aVWhat is fuzzy rope, you ask?
p185
aVIt's just that; it's this very inexpensive thing,
p186
aVavailable practically at your hardware store, and it's very cheap.
p187
aVSo we imagine that we would actually
p188
aVpotentially even host a bake sale
p189
aVto start our new project.
p190
aV(Laughter)
p191
aVSo in the studio, rather than drawing,
p192
aVwe began to learn how to knit.
p193
aVThe concept was to really knit this rope together
p194
aVand develop this new soft infrastructure
p195
aVfor the oysters to grow on.
p196
aVYou can see in the diagram how it grows over time
p197
aVfrom an infrastructural space
p198
aVinto a new public urban space.
p199
aVAnd that grows over time dynamically
p200
aVwith the threat of climate change.
p201
aa(lp202
VIt also creates this incredibly interesting, I think,
p203
aVnew amphibious public space,
p204
aVwhere you can imagine working,
p205
aVyou can imagine recreating in a new way.
p206
aVIn the end, what we realized we were making
p207
aVwas a new blue-green watery park
p208
aVfor the next watery century \u2014
p209
aVan amphibious park, if you will.
p210
aVSo get your Tevas on.
p211
aVSo you can imagine scuba diving here.
p212
aVThis is an image of high school students,
p213
aVscuba divers that we worked with on our team.
p214
aVSo you can imagine a sort of new manner of living
p215
aVwith a new relationship with the water,
p216
aVand also a hybridizing of recreational and science programs
p217
aVin terms of monitoring.
p218
aa(lp219
VAnother new vocabulary word for the brave new world:
p220
aVthis is the word "flupsy" \u2014
p221
aVit's short for "floating upwelling system."
p222
aVAnd this glorious, readily available device
p223
aVis basically a floating raft
p224
aVwith an oyster nursery below.
p225
aVSo the water is churned through this raft.
p226
aVYou can see the eight chambers on the side
p227
aVhost little baby oysters and essentially force-feed them.
p228
aVSo rather than having 10 oysters,
p229
aVyou have 10,000 oysters.
p230
aVAnd then those spat are then seeded.
p231
aVHere's the Gowanus future
p232
aVwith the oyster rafts on the shorelines \u2014
p233
aVthe flupsification of the Gowanus.
p234
aVNew word.
p235
aVAnd also showing oyster gardening for the community
p236
aValong its edges.
p237
aVAnd finally, how much fun it would be
p238
aVto watch the flupsy parade
p239
aVand cheer on the oyster spats
p240
aVas they go down to the reef.
p241
aa(lp242
VI get asked two questions about this project.
p243
aVOne is: why isn't it happening now?
p244
aVAnd the second one is: when can we eat the oysters?
p245
aVAnd the answer is: not yet, they're working.
p246
aVBut we imagine, with our calculations,
p247
aVthat by 2050,
p248
aVyou might be able to sink your teeth into a Gowanus oyster.
p249
aa(lp250
VTo conclude, this is just one cross-section
p251
aVof one piece of city,
p252
aVbut my dream is, my hope is,
p253
aVthat when you all go back to your own cities
p254
aVthat we can start to work together and collaborate
p255
aVon remaking and reforming
p256
aVa new urban landscape
p257
aVtowards a more sustainable, a more livable
p258
aVand a more delicious future.
