VI love to collect things.
p4
aVEver since I was a kid, I've had massive collections
p5
aVof random stuff, everything from bizarre hot sauces
p6
aVfrom all around the world to insects
p7
aVthat I've captured and put in jars.
p8
aa(lp9
VNow, it's no secret, because I like collecting things,
p10
aVthat I love the Natural History Museum
p11
aVand the collections of animals
p12
aVat the Natural History Museum in dioramas.
p13
aVThese, to me, are like living sculptures, right,
p14
aVthat you can go and look at,
p15
aVand they memorialize a specific point of time
p16
aVin this animal's life.
p17
aa(lp18
VSo I was thinking about my own life,
p19
aVand how I'd like to memorialize my life, you know,
p20
aVfor the ages, and also \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p21
aVthe lives of my friends, but
p22
aVthe problem with this is that my friends aren't quite keen
p23
aVon the idea of me taxidermy-ing them. (Laughter)
p24
aa(lp25
VSo instead, I turned to video,
p26
aVand video is the next best way to preserve and memorialize
p27
aVsomeone and to capture a specific moment in time.
p28
aVSo what I did was, I filmed six of my friends
p29
aVand then, using video mapping and video projection,
p30
aVI created a video sculpture, which was these six friends
p31
aVprojected into jars. (Laughter)
p32
aVSo now I have this collection of my friends
p33
aVI can take around with me whenever I go,
p34
aVand this is called Animalia Chordata,
p35
aVfrom the Latin nomenclature for
p36
aVhuman being, classification system.
p37
aVSo this piece memorializes my friends in these jars,
p38
aVand they actually move around. (Laughter)
p39
aa(lp40
VSo, this is interesting to me,
p41
aVbut it lacked a certain human element. (Laughter)
p42
aVIt's a digital sculpture, so I wanted to add
p43
aVan interaction system. So what I did was,
p44
aVI added a proximity sensor, so that when you get close
p45
aVto the people in jars, they react to you in different ways.
p46
aVYou know, just like people on the street
p47
aVwhen you get too close to them.
p48
aVSome people reacted in terror. (Laughter)
p49
aVOthers reacted in asking you for help,
p50
aVand some people hide from you.
p51
aa(lp52
VSo this was really interesting to me, this idea of
p53
aVtaking video off the screen and putting it in real life,
p54
aVand also adding interactivity to sculpture.
p55
aVSo over the next year, I documented 40 of my other friends
p56
aVand trapped them in jars as well
p57
aVand created a piece known as Garden,
p58
aVwhich is literally a garden of humanity.
p59
aa(lp60
VBut something about the first piece,
p61
aVthe Animali Chordata piece, kept coming back to me,
p62
aVthis idea of interaction with art,
p63
aVand I really liked the idea of people being able to interact,
p64
aVand also being challenged by interacting with art.
p65
aVSo I wanted to create a new piece that actually
p66
aVforced people to come and interact with something,
p67
aVand the way I did this was actually by projecting
p68
aVa 1950s housewife into a blender. (Laughter)
p69
aVThis is a piece called Blend, and what it does is
p70
aVit actually makes you implicit in the work of art.
p71
aVYou may never experience the entire thing yourself.
p72
aVYou can walk away, you can just watch as this character
p73
aVstands there in the blender and looks at you,
p74
aVor you can actually choose to interact with it.
p75
aVSo if you do choose to interact with the piece,
p76
aVand you press the blender button, it actually sends
p77
aVthis character into this dizzying disarray of dishevelment.
p78
aVBy doing that, you are now part of my piece.
p79
aVYou, like the people that are trapped in my work
p80
aV\u2014 (Blender noises, laughter) \u2014
p81
aVhave become part of my work as well. (Laughter)
p82
aV(Laughter)
p83
aV(Applause)
p84
aa(lp85
VBut, but this seems a bit unfair, right?
p86
aVI put my friends in jars, I put this character,
p87
aVthis sort of endangered species character in a blender.
p88
aVBut I'd never done anything about myself.
p89
aVI'd never really memorialized myself.
p90
aVSo I decided to create a piece which is a self-portrait piece.
p91
aVThis is sort of a self-portrait taxidermy time capsule piece
p92
aVcalled A Point Just Passed,
p93
aVin which I project myself on top of a time card punch clock,
p94
aVand it's up to you.
p95
aVIf you want to choose to punch that punch card clock,
p96
aVyou actually age me.
p97
aVSo I start as a baby, and then if you punch the clock,
p98
aVyou'll actually transform the baby into a toddler,
p99
aVand then from a toddler I'm transformed into a teenager.
p100
aVFrom a teenager, I'm transformed into my current self.
p101
aVFrom my current self, I'm turned into a middle-aged man,
p102
aVand then, from there, into an elderly man.
p103
aVAnd if you punch the punch card clock a hundred times
p104
aVin one day, the piece goes black
p105
aVand is not to be reset until the next day.
p106
aVSo, in doing so, you're erasing time.
p107
aVYou're actually implicit in this work
p108
aVand you're erasing my life.
p109
aa(lp110
VSo I like this about interactive video sculpture,
p111
aVthat you can actually interact with it,
p112
aVthat all of you can actually touch an artwork
p113
aVand be part of the artwork yourselves,
p114
aVand hopefully, one day, I'll have each and every one of you
p115
aVtrapped in one of my jars. (Laughter)
p116
aa(lp117
VThank you. (Applause)
