VTwelve years ago, I founded Zipcar.
p4
aVZipcar buys cars and parks them
p5
aVthroughout dense metropolitan areas
p6
aVfor people to use, by the hour and by the day,
p7
aVinstead of owning their own cars.
p8
aVEach Zipcar replaces 15 personal cars,
p9
aVand each driver drives about 80 percent less
p10
aVbecause they're now paying the full cost,
p11
aVall at once, in real time.
p12
aVBut what Zipcar really did was make sharing the norm.
p13
aa(lp14
VNow, a decade later, it's really time to push the envelope a little bit,
p15
aVand so a couple years ago I moved to Paris
p16
aVwith my husband and youngest child,
p17
aVand we launched Buzzcar a year ago.
p18
aVBuzzcar lets people rent out their own cars
p19
aVto their friends and neighbors.
p20
aVInstead of investing in a car, we invest in a community.
p21
aVWe bring the power of a corporation
p22
aVto individuals who add their cars to the network.
p23
aVSome people call this peer-to-peer.
p24
aVThis does express the humanity of what's going on,
p25
aVand the personal relationships,
p26
aVbut that is also like saying that it's the same thing
p27
aVas a yard sale or a bake sale or babysitting.
p28
aVThat's peer-to-peer.
p29
aVIt's like saying yard sales are the same thing as eBay,
p30
aVor craft fairs are the same thing as Etsy.
p31
aa(lp32
VBut what's really happening is that we've got the power
p33
aVof a free and open Internet,
p34
aVand on top of that we're putting a platform for participation,
p35
aVand the peers are now in partnership with the company,
p36
aVcreating shared value on shared values,
p37
aVand each strengthening the other, and doing what the other can't do.
p38
aVI call this Peers, Inc.
p39
aVThe incorporated side, the company,
p40
aVis doing things that it does really well.
p41
aVWhat does it do really well? It creates economies of scale,
p42
aVsignificant and long-term resource investment,
p43
aVthe expertise of many different kinds of people
p44
aVand different kinds of minds, and for individuals,
p45
aVconsumers, it's bringing the standards, rules and recourse
p46
aVthat we really want as consumers,
p47
aVand this is kind of bound up in a brand promise,
p48
aVand the companies are providing this on a platform for participation.
p49
aVPeers are giving and doing things
p50
aVthat are incredibly expensive for companies to do.
p51
aVWhat do they bring? They bring this fabulous diversity,
p52
aVexpensive for companies. And what does that deliver?
p53
aVIt delivers localization and customization,
p54
aVspecialization, and all of this aspect about social networks
p55
aVand how companies are yearning and eager to get inside there?
p56
aVIt's natural for me. Me and my friends, I can connect to them easily.
p57
aVAnd it also delivers really fabulous innovation,
p58
aVand I'll talk about that later.
p59
aa(lp60
VSo we have the peers that are providing the services and the product,
p61
aVand the company that's doing the stuff that companies do.
p62
aVThe two of these are delivering the best of both worlds.
p63
aVSome of my favorite examples:
p64
aVin transportation, Carpooling.com. Ten years old,
p65
aVthree and a half million people have joined up,
p66
aVand a million rides are shared every day.
p67
aVIt's a phenomenal thing. It's the equivalent
p68
aVof 2,500 TGV trains,
p69
aVand just think, they didn't have to lay a track or buy a car.
p70
aVThis is all happening with excess capacity.
p71
aa(lp72
VAnd it's not just with transportation, my love,
p73
aVbut of course in other realms. Here's Fiverr.com.
p74
aVI met these founders just weeks after they had launched,
p75
aVand now, in two years, what would you do for five dollars?
p76
aVSeven hundred and fifty thousand gigs are now posted after two years,
p77
aVwhat people would do for five dollars.
p78
aVAnd not just easy things that anyone can do.
p79
aVThis Peers, Inc. concept is in a very difficult and complex realm.
p80
aVTopCoder has 400,000 engineers who are delivering
p81
aVcomplex design and engineering services.
p82
aVWhen I talked to their CEO, he had this great line.
p83
aVHe said, "We have a community that owns its own company."
p84
aVAnd then my all-time favorite, Etsy.
p85
aVEtsy is providing goods that people make themselves
p86
aVand they're selling it in a marketplace.
p87
aVIt just celebrated its seventh anniversary,
p88
aVand after seven years, last year it delivered
p89
aV530 million dollars' worth of sales to all those individuals
p90
aVwho have been making those objects.
p91
aa(lp92
VI know you guys out there who are businesspeople,
p93
aVare thinking, "Oh my God, I want to build one of those.
p94
aVI see this incredible speed and scale.
p95
aVYou mean all I have to do is build a platform and all these people are going
p96
aVto put their stuff on top and I sit back and roll it in?"
p97
aVBuilding these platforms for participation are so nontrivial to do.
p98
aVI think of the difference of Google Video versus YouTube.
p99
aVWho would have thought that two young guys and a start-up
p100
aVwould beat out Google Video? Why?
p101
aVI actually have no idea why. I didn't talk to them.
p102
aVBut I'm thinking, you know, they probably had
p103
aVthe "share" button a little bit brighter and to the right,
p104
aVand so it was easier and more convenient for the two sides
p105
aVthat are always participating on these networks.
p106
aa(lp107
VSo I actually know a lot about building a peer platform now,
p108
aVand a Peers, Inc. company, because I've spent
p109
aVthe last two years doing that in Paris.
p110
aVSo let me take you back how it's so incredibly different
p111
aVbuilding Buzzcar than it was building Zipcar,
p112
aVbecause now every single thing we do has these two
p113
aVdifferent bodies that I have to be thinking about:
p114
aVthe owners who are going to provide the cars
p115
aVand the drivers who are going to rent them.
p116
aVEvery single decision, I have to think about what is right for both sides.
p117
aVThere are many, many examples and I'll give you one
p118
aVthat is not my favorite example: insurance.
p119
aVIt took me a year and a half to get the insurance just right.
p120
aVHours and hours of sitting with insurers and many companies
p121
aVand their thoughts about risk and how this is totally innovative,
p122
aVthey'd never thought of it before.
p123
aVWay too much money, I just can't even go there, with lawyers,
p124
aVtrying to figure out how this is different, who's responsible to whom,
p125
aVand the result was that we were able to provide owners
p126
aVprotection for their own driving records and their own history.
p127
aVThe cars are completely insured during the rental,
p128
aVand it gives drivers what they need, and what do they need?
p129
aVThey need a low deductible,
p130
aVand 24-hour roadside assistance.
p131
aVSo this was a trick to get these two sides.
p132
aa(lp133
VSo now I want to take you to the moment of \u2014
p134
aVWhen you're an entrepreneur, and you've started a new company,
p135
aVthere's the, here's all the stuff we do beforehand,
p136
aVand then the service launches. What happens?
p137
aVSo all those months of work, they come into play.
p138
aa(lp139
VLast June 1, we launched. It was an exciting moment.
p140
aVAnd all the owners are adding their cars. It's really exciting.
p141
aVAll the drivers are becoming members. It's excellent.
p142
aVThe reservations start coming in, and here,
p143
aVowners who were getting text messages and emails
p144
aVthat said, "Hey, Joe wants to rent your car for the weekend.
p145
aVYou can earn 60 euros. Isn't that great? Yes or no?"
p146
aVNo reply. Like, a huge proportion of them
p147
aVcouldn't be bothered after they had just started, they just signed up, to reply.
p148
aVSo I thought, "Duh, Robin, this is the difference between
p149
aVindustrial production and peer production."
p150
aVIndustrial production, the whole point of industrial production
p151
aVis to provide a standardized, exact service model
p152
aVthat is consistent every single time,
p153
aVand I'm really thankful that my smartphone is made
p154
aVusing industrial production.
p155
aVAnd Zipcar provides a very nice, consistent service
p156
aVthat works fabulously.
p157
aVBut what does peer production do? Peer production
p158
aVis this completely different way of doing things,
p159
aVand you have a big quality range, and so eBay, cleverly,
p160
aVthe first peer production, Peer, Inc. company, I'd say,
p161
aVthey figured out early on, we need to have ratings
p162
aVand commentaries and all that yucky side stuff.
p163
aVWe can flag that and we can put it to the side, and people
p164
aVwho are buyers and consumers don't have to deal with it.
p165
aa(lp166
VSo going back, this is my look of excitement and joy,
p167
aVbecause all this stuff that I'd also been hoping for
p168
aVactually really did happen, and what's that?
p169
aVThat is the diversity of what's going on.
p170
aVYou have these different fabulous owners
p171
aVand their different cars, different prices,
p172
aVdifferent locations. (Laughter)
p173
aVThey dress differently, and they look different,
p174
aVand, really, I love these photos every time I look at them.
p175
aVCool guys, excited guys,
p176
aVand here is Selma, who \u2014 I love this driver.
p177
aVAnd after a year, we have 1,000 cars
p178
aVthat are parked across France and 6,000 people
p179
aVwho are members and eager to drive them.
p180
aVThis would not be possible to do that in economic fashion
p181
aVfor a traditional company.
p182
aa(lp183
VBack to this spectrum.
p184
aVSo what's happening is, we had the yuck side,
p185
aVbut we actually had this real wow side.
p186
aVAnd I can tell you two great stories.
p187
aVA driver was telling me that they went to rent a car
p188
aVto go up the coast of France and the owner gave it to them,
p189
aVand said, "You know what, here's where the cliffs are,
p190
aVand here's all the beaches, and this is my best beach,
p191
aVand this is where the best fish restaurant is."
p192
aVAnd the peers also become,
p193
aVpeers and owners create relationships,
p194
aVand so at the last minute people can \u2014
p195
aVa driver can say, "Hey, you know what, I really need the car,
p196
aVis it available?" And that person will say,
p197
aV"Sure, my wife's at home. Go pick up the keys. Go do it."
p198
aVSo you can have these really nice things that can't happen,
p199
aVand it's a kind of "Wow!" and I want to say "Wow!"
p200
aVtype of thing that's happening here, because individuals,
p201
aVif you're a company, what happens is you might have
p202
aV10 people who are in charge of innovation,
p203
aVor 100 people who are in charge of innovation.
p204
aVWhat happens in Peer, Inc. companies is that you have
p205
aVtens and hundreds and thousands and even millions
p206
aVof people who are creating experiments on this model,
p207
aVand so out of all that influence and that effort,
p208
aVyou are having this exceptional amount of innovation
p209
aVthat is coming out.
p210
aa(lp211
VSo one of the reasons, if we come back to why did I
p212
aVcall it Buzzcar? I wanted to remind all of us
p213
aVabout the power of the hive,
p214
aVand its incredible facility to create this platform
p215
aVthat individuals want to participate and innovate on.
p216
aVAnd for me, when I think about our future,
p217
aVand all of those problems that seem incredibly large,
p218
aVthe scale is impossible, the urgency is there,
p219
aVPeers, Inc. provides the speed and scale
p220
aVand the innovation and the creativity that is going to answer these problems.
p221
aVAll we have to do is create a fabulous platform for participation \u2014 nontrivial.
p222
aa(lp223
VSo I continue to think that
p224
aVtransportation is the center of the hard universe.
p225
aVAll problems come back to transportation for me.
p226
aVBut there are all these other areas that are these profound,
p227
aVbig problems that I know that we can work on,
p228
aVand people are working on them in many different sectors,
p229
aVbut there's this really fabulous group of things
p230
aVwith the power of this Peers, Inc. model.
p231
aa(lp232
VSo over the last decade, we've been reveling in
p233
aVthe power of the Internet and how it's empowered individuals,
p234
aVand for me, what Peers, Inc. does
p235
aVis it takes it up a notch. We're now bringing the power
p236
aVof the company and the corporation
p237
aVand supercharging individuals.
p238
aVSo for me, it's a collaboration.
p239
aVTogether, we can. (Applause)
p240
aVThank you. (Applause)
