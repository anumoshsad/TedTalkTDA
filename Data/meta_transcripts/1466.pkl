VSo I thought I'd talk about identity.
p4
aVThat's sort of an interesting enough topic to me.
p5
aVAnd the reason was, because when I was asked to do this,
p6
aVI'd just read, in one of the papers, I can't remember,
p7
aVsomething from someone at Facebook saying, well,
p8
aV"we need to make everybody use their real names."
p9
aVand then that's basically all the problems solved.
p10
aVAnd that's so wrong,
p11
aVthat's such a fundamentally, reactionary view of identity,
p12
aVand it's going to get us into all sorts of trouble.
p13
aVAnd so what I thought I'd do
p14
aVis I'll explain four sort of problems about it,
p15
aVand then I'll suggest a solution,
p16
aVwhich hopefully you might find interesting.
p17
aa(lp18
VSo just to frame the problem,
p19
aVwhat does authenticity mean?
p20
aVThat's me, that's a camera phone picture of me
p21
aVlooking at a painting.
p22
aV[What's the Problem?]
p23
aVThat's a painting that was painted
p24
aVby a very famous forger,
p25
aVand because I'm not very good at presentations,
p26
aVI already can't remember the name that I wrote on my card.
p27
aVAnd he was incarcerated in, I think, Wakefield Prison
p28
aVfor forging masterpieces by, I think, French Impressionists.
p29
aVAnd he's so good at it, that when he was in prison,
p30
aVeverybody in prison, the governor and whatever,
p31
aVwanted him to paint masterpieces to put on the walls,
p32
aVbecause they were so good.
p33
aVAnd so that's a masterpiece,
p34
aVwhich is a fake of a masterpiece,
p35
aVand bonded into the canvas is a chip which identifies that as a real fake,
p36
aVif you see what I mean.
p37
aV(Laughter)
p38
aVSo when we're talking about authenticity,
p39
aVit's a little more fractal than it appears and that's a good example to show it.
p40
aVI tried to pick four problems that will frame the issue properly.
p41
aa(lp42
VSo the first problem, I thought,
p43
aVChip and PIN, right?
p44
aV[Banks and legacies bringing down the system from within]
p45
aV[Offline solutions do not work online]
p46
aVI'm guessing everyone's got a chip and PIN card, right?
p47
aVSo why is that a good example?
p48
aVThat's the example of how legacy thinking about identity
p49
aVsubverts the security of a well-constructed system.
p50
aVThat chip and PIN card that's in your pocket
p51
aVhas a little chip on it that cost millions of pounds to develop,
p52
aVis extremely secure,
p53
aVyou can put scanning electron microscopes on it,
p54
aVyou can try and grind it down, blah blah blah.
p55
aVThose chips have never been broken, whatever you read in the paper.
p56
aVAnd for a joke, we take that super-secure chip
p57
aVand we bond it to a trivially counterfeitable magnetic stripe
p58
aVand for very lazy criminals, we still emboss the card.
p59
aVSo if you're a criminal in a hurry and you need to copy someone's card,
p60
aVyou can just stick a piece of paper on it and rub a pencil over it
p61
aVjust to sort of speed things up.
p62
aVAnd even more amusingly, and on my debit card too,
p63
aVwe print the name and the SALT code and everything else on the front too.
p64
aVWhy?
p65
aVThere is no earthly reason why your name is printed on a chip and PIN card.
p66
aVAnd if you think about it,
p67
aVit's even more insidious and perverse than it seems at first.
p68
aVBecause the only people that benefit
p69
aVfrom having the name on the card are criminals.
p70
aVYou know what your name is, right?
p71
aV(Laughter)
p72
aVAnd when you go into a shop and buy something,
p73
aVit's a PIN, he doesn't care what the name is.
p74
aVThe only place where you ever have to write your name on the back
p75
aVis in America at the moment.
p76
aVAnd whenever I go to America,
p77
aVand I have to pay with a mag stripe on the back of the card,
p78
aVI always sign it Carlos Tethers anyway,
p79
aVjust as a security mechanism,
p80
aVbecause if a transaction ever gets disputed,
p81
aVand it comes back and it says Dave Birch,
p82
aVI know it must have been a criminal,
p83
aVbecause I would never sign it Dave Birch.
p84
aV(Laughter)
p85
aVSo if you drop your card in the street,
p86
aVit means a criminal can pick it up and read it.
p87
aVThey know the name,
p88
aVfrom the name they can find the address,
p89
aVand then they can go off and buy stuff online.
p90
aVWhy do we put the name on the card?
p91
aVBecause we think identity is something to do with names,
p92
aVand because we're rooted in the idea of the identity card,
p93
aVwhich obsesses us.
p94
aVAnd I know it crashed and burned a couple of years ago,
p95
aVbut if you're someone in politics or the home office or whatever,
p96
aVand you think about identity,
p97
aVyou can only think of identity in terms of cards with names on them.
p98
aVAnd that's very subversive in a modern world.
p99
aa(lp100
VSo the second example I thought I'd use
p101
aVis chatrooms.
p102
aV[Chatrooms and Children]
p103
aVI'm very proud of that picture, that's my son
p104
aVplaying in his band with his friends for the first-ever gig,
p105
aVI believe you call it, where he got paid.
p106
aV(Laughter)
p107
aVAnd I love that picture.
p108
aVI like the picture of him getting into medical school a lot better,
p109
aV(Laughter)
p110
aVI like that picture for the moment.
p111
aVWhy do I use that picture?
p112
aVBecause that was very interesting, watching that experience as an old person.
p113
aVSo him and his friends,
p114
aVthey get together, they booked a room, like a church hall,
p115
aVand they got all their friends who had bands,
p116
aVand they got them together,
p117
aVand they do it all on Facebook,
p118
aVand then they sell tickets, and the first band on the -
p119
aVI was going to say "menu,"
p120
aVthat's probably the wrong word for it, isn't it?
p121
aVThe first band on the list of bands
p122
aVthat appears at some public music performance of some kind
p123
aVgets the sales from the first 20 tickets,
p124
aVthen the next band gets the next 20,
p125
aVand so on.
p126
aVThey were at the bottom of the menu,
p127
aVthey were like fifth, I thought they had no chance.
p128
aVHe actually got 20 quid. Fantastic, right?
p129
aVBut my point is, that all worked perfectly,
p130
aVexcept on the web.
p131
aVSo they're sitting on Facebook,
p132
aVand they're sending these messages and arranging things
p133
aVand they don't know who anybody is, right?
p134
aVThat's the big problem we're trying to solve.
p135
aVIf only they were using the real names,
p136
aVThen you wouldn't be worried about them on the Internet.
p137
aVAnd so when he says to me,
p138
aV"Oh, I want to go to a chatroom to talk about guitars" or something,
p139
aVI'm like, "oh, well, I don't want you to go into a chatroom
p140
aVto talk about guitars, because they might not all be your friends,
p141
aVand some of the people that are in the chatroom
p142
aVmight be perverts and teachers and vicars."
p143
aV(Laughter)
p144
aVI mean, they generally are, when you look in the paper, right?
p145
aVSo I want to know who all the people in the chatroom are.
p146
aVSo okay, you can go in the chatroom,
p147
aVbut only if everybody in the chatroom is using their real names,
p148
aVand they submit full copies of their police report.
p149
aVBut of course, if anybody in the chatroom asked for his real name,
p150
aVI'd say no. You can't give them your real name.
p151
aVBecause what happens if they turn out to be perverts,
p152
aVand teachers and whatever.
p153
aa(lp154
VSo you have this odd sort of paradox
p155
aVwhere I'm happy for him to go into this space
p156
aVif I know who everybody else is,
p157
aVbut I don't want anybody else to know who he is.
p158
aVAnd so you get this sort of logjam around identity
p159
aVwhere you want full disclosure from everybody else,
p160
aVbut not from yourself.
p161
aVAnd there's no progress, we get stuck.
p162
aVAnd so the chatroom thing doesn't work properly,
p163
aVand it's a very bad way of thinking about identity.
p164
aa(lp165
VSo on my RSS feed, I saw this thing about -
p166
aVI just said something bad about my RSS feed, didn't I?
p167
aVI should stop saying it like that.
p168
aVFor some random reason, I can't imagine,
p169
aVsomething about cheerleaders turned up in my inbox.
p170
aVAnd I read this story about cheerleaders,
p171
aVand it's a fascinating story.
p172
aVThis happened a couple of years ago in the U.S.
p173
aVThere were some cheerleaders in a team at a high school
p174
aVin the U.S., and they said mean things
p175
aVabout their cheerleading coach,
p176
aVas I'm sure kids do about all of their teachers
p177
aVall of the time,
p178
aVand somehow the cheerleading coach found out about this.
p179
aVShe was very upset.
p180
aVAnd so she went to one of the girls, and said,
p181
aV"you have to give me your Facebook password."
p182
aVI read this all the time, where even at some universities
p183
aVand places of education,
p184
aVkids are forced to hand over their Facebook passwords.
p185
aVSo you've got to give them your Facebook password.
p186
aVShe was a kid!
p187
aVWhat she should have said
p188
aVis, "my lawyer will be calling you
p189
aVfirst thing in the morning.
p190
aVIt's an outrageous imposition
p191
aVon my 4th Amendment right to privacy,
p192
aVand you're going to be sued
p193
aVfor all the money you've got."
p194
aVThat's what she should have said.
p195
aVBut she's a kid,
p196
aVso she hands over the password.
p197
aVThe teacher can't log into Facebook,
p198
aVbecause the school has blocked access to Facebook.
p199
aVSo the teacher can't log into Facebook until she gets home.
p200
aVSo the girl tells her friends,
p201
aVguess what happened?
p202
aVThe teacher logged in, she knows.
p203
aVSo the girls just all logged into Facebook on their phones,
p204
aVand deleted their profiles.
p205
aVAnd so when the teacher logged in, there was nothing there.
p206
aVMy point is, those identities, they don't think about them the same way.
p207
aa(lp208
VIdentity is, especially when you're a teenager, a fluid thing.
p209
aVYou have lots of identities.
p210
aVAnd you can have an identity, you don't like it,
p211
aVbecause it's subverted in some way, or it's insecure, or it's inappropriate,
p212
aVyou just delete it and get another one.
p213
aVThe idea that you have an identity that's given to you by someone,
p214
aVthe government or whatever,
p215
aVand you have to stick with that identity and use it in all places,
p216
aVthat's absolutely wrong.
p217
aVWhy would you want to really know who someone was on Facebook,
p218
aVunless you wanted to abuse them and harass them in some way?
p219
aVAnd it just doesn't work properly.
p220
aVAnd my fourth example is there are some cases
p221
aVwhere you really want to be -
p222
aVIn case you're wondering, that's me at the G20 protest.
p223
aVI wasn't actually at the G20 protest, but I had a meeting at a bank
p224
aVon the day of the G20 protest, and I got an email from the bank
p225
aVsaying please don't wear a suit, because it'll inflame the protesters.
p226
aVI look pretty good in a suit, frankly,
p227
aVso you can see why it would drive them
p228
aVinto an anti-capitalist frenzy.
p229
aV(Laughter)
p230
aVSo I thought, well, look.
p231
aVIf I don't want to inflame the protesters,
p232
aVthe obvious thing to do
p233
aVis go dressed as a protester.
p234
aVSo I went dressed completely in black,
p235
aVyou know, with a black balaclava,
p236
aVI had black gloves on,
p237
aVbut I've taken them off to sign the visitor's book.
p238
aV(Laughter)
p239
aVI'm wearing black trousers, black boots,
p240
aVI'm dressed completely in black.
p241
aVI go into the bank at 10 o'clock,
p242
aVgo, "Hi, I'm Dave Birch,
p243
aVI've got a 3 o'clock with so and so there."
p244
aVSure. They sign me in.
p245
aVThere's my visitor's badge.
p246
aV(Laughter)
p247
aa(lp248
VSo this nonsense
p249
aVabout you've got to have real names on Facebook and whatever,
p250
aVthat gets you that kind of security.
p251
aVThat gets you security theater, where there's no actual security,
p252
aVbut people are sort of playing parts in a play about security.
p253
aVAnd as long as everybody learns their lines,
p254
aVeveryone's happy.
p255
aVBut it's not real security.
p256
aVEspecially because I hate banks more than the G20 protesters do,
p257
aVbecause I work for them.
p258
aVI know that things are actually worse than these guys think.
p259
aV(Laughter)
p260
aVBut suppose I worked next to somebody in a bank
p261
aVwho was doing something.
p262
aVSuppose I was sitting next to a rogue trader,
p263
aVand I want to report it to the boss of the bank.
p264
aVSo I log on to do a little bit of whistleblowing.
p265
aVI send a message, this guy's a rogue trader.
p266
aVThat message is meaningless
p267
aVif you don't know that I'm a trader at the bank.
p268
aVIf that message just comes from anybody,
p269
aVit has zero information value.
p270
aVThere's no point in sending that message.
p271
aVBut if I have to prove who I am,
p272
aVI'll never send that message.
p273
aVIt's just like the nurse in the hospital reporting the drunk surgeon.
p274
aVThat message will only happen if I'm anonymous.
p275
aVSo the system has to have ways of providing anonymity there,
p276
aVotherwise we don't get where we want to get to.
p277
aa(lp278
VSo four issues. So what are we going to do about it?
p279
aVWell, what we tend to do about it
p280
aVis we think about Orwell space.
p281
aVAnd we try to make electronic versions
p282
aVof the identity card that we got rid of in 1953.
p283
aVSo we think if we had a card,
p284
aVcall it a Facebook login,
p285
aVwhich proves who you are,
p286
aVand I make you carry it all the time,
p287
aVthat solves the problem.
p288
aVAnd of course, for all those reasons I've just outlined,
p289
aVit doesn't, and it might, actually,
p290
aVmake some problems worse.
p291
aVThe more times you're forced to use your real identity,
p292
aVcertainly in transactional terms,
p293
aVthe more likely that identity is to get stolen and subverted.
p294
aVThe goal is to stop people from using identity
p295
aVin transactions which don't need identity,
p296
aVwhich is actually almost all transactions.
p297
aVAlmost all of the transactions you do
p298
aVare not, who are you?
p299
aVThey're, are you allowed to drive the car,
p300
aVare you allowed in the building,
p301
aVare you over 18,
p302
aVetcetera, etcetera.
p303
aVSo my suggestion-I, like James,
p304
aVthink that there should be a resurgence of interest in R & D.
p305
aa(lp306
VI think this is a solvable problem.
p307
aVIt's something we can do about.
p308
aVNaturally, in these circumstances,
p309
aVI turn to Doctor Who.
p310
aVBecause in this,
p311
aVas in so many other walks of life,
p312
aVDoctor Who has already shown us the answer.
p313
aVSo I should say,
p314
aVfor some of our foreign visitors,
p315
aVDoctor Who is the greatest living scientist in England,
p316
aV(Laughter)
p317
aVand a beacon of truth and enlightenment to all of us.
p318
aVAnd this is Doctor Who with his psychic paper.
p319
aVCome on, you guys must have seen Doctor Who's psychic paper.
p320
aVYou're not nerds if you say yes.
p321
aVWho's seen Doctor Who's psychic paper?
p322
aVOh right, you were in the library the whole time studying I guess.
p323
aVIs that what you're going to tell us?
p324
aVDoctor Who's psychic paper
p325
aVis when you hold up the psychic paper,
p326
aVthe person, in their brain,
p327
aVsees the thing that they need to see.
p328
aVSo I want to show you a British passport,
p329
aVI hold up the psychic paper,
p330
aVyou see a British passport.
p331
aVI want to get into a party,
p332
aVI hold up the psychic paper,
p333
aVI show you a party invitation.
p334
aVYou see what you want to see.
p335
aVSo what I'm saying is we need to make an electronic version of that,
p336
aVbut with one tiny, tiny change,
p337
aVwhich is that it'll only show you the British passport
p338
aVif I've actually got one.
p339
aVIt'll only show you the party invitation
p340
aVif I actually have one.
p341
aVIt will only show you that I'm over 18 if I actually am over 18.
p342
aVBut nothing else.
p343
aVSo you're the bouncer at the pub, you need to know that I'm over 18,
p344
aVinstead of showing you my driving license,
p345
aVwhich shows you I know how to drive,
p346
aVwhat my name is, my address, all these kind of things,
p347
aVI show you my psychic paper,
p348
aVand all it tells you is am I over 18 or not.
p349
aVRight.
p350
aa(lp351
VIs that just a pipe dream?
p352
aVOf course not, otherwise I wouldn't be here talking to you.
p353
aVSo in order to build that and make it work,
p354
aVI'm only going to name these things, I'll not go into them,
p355
aVwe need a plan,
p356
aVwhich is we're going to build this
p357
aVas an infrastructure for everybody to use,
p358
aVto solve all of these problems.
p359
aVWe're going to make a utility,
p360
aVthe utility has to be universal,
p361
aVyou can use it everywhere,
p362
aVI'm just giving you little flashes of the technology as we go along.
p363
aVThat's a Japanese ATM,
p364
aVthe fingerprint template is stored inside the mobile phone.
p365
aVSo when you want to draw money out,
p366
aVyou put the mobile phone on the ATM,
p367
aVand touch your finger,
p368
aVyour fingerprint goes through to the phone,
p369
aVthe phone says yes, that's whoever,
p370
aVand the ATM then gives you some money.
p371
aVIt has to be a utility that you can use everywhere.
p372
aVIt has to be absolutely convenient,
p373
aVthat's me going into the pub.
p374
aVAll the device on the door of the pub is allowed is,
p375
aVis this person over 18 and not barred from the pub?
p376
aVAnd so the idea is, you touch your ID card to the door,
p377
aVand if I am allowed in, it shows my picture,
p378
aVif I'm not allowed in, it shows a red cross.
p379
aVIt doesn't disclose any other information.
p380
aVIt has to have no special gadgets.
p381
aVThat can only mean one thing,
p382
aVfollowing on from Ross's statement,
p383
aVwhich I agree with completely.
p384
aVIf it means no special gadgets,
p385
aVit has to run on a mobile phone.
p386
aVThat's the only choice we have,
p387
aVwe have to make it work on mobile phones.
p388
aVThere are 6.6 billion
p389
aVmobile phone subscriptions.
p390
aVMy favorite statistic of all time,
p391
aVonly 4 billion toothbrushes in the world.
p392
aVThat means something,
p393
aVI don't know what.
p394
aV(Laughter)
p395
aVI rely on our futurologists to tell me.
p396
aVIt has to be a utility which is extensible.
p397
aVSo it has to be something
p398
aVthat anybody could build on.
p399
aVAnybody should be able to use this infrastructure,
p400
aVyou don't need permissions, licenses, whatever,
p401
aVanyone should be able to write some code to do this.
p402
aa(lp403
VYou know what symmetry is,
p404
aVso you don't need a picture of it.
p405
aVThis is how we're going to do it.
p406
aVWe're going to do it using phones,
p407
aVand we're going to do it
p408
aVusing mobile proximity.
p409
aVI'm going to suggest to you
p410
aVthe technology to implement
p411
aVDoctor Who's psychic paper
p412
aVis already here, and if any of you
p413
aVhave got one of the new Barclay's debit cards
p414
aVwith the contactless interface on it,
p415
aVyou've already got that technology.
p416
aVIf you've ever been up to the big city,
p417
aVand used an Oyster card at all,
p418
aVdoes that ring any bells to anybody?
p419
aVThe technology already exists.
p420
aVThe first phones
p421
aVthat have the technology built in,
p422
aVthe Google Nexus, the S2,
p423
aVthe Samsung Wifi 7.9,
p424
aVthe first phones that have
p425
aVthe technology built into them
p426
aVare already in the shops.
p427
aVSo the idea that the gas man
p428
aVcan turn up at my mom's door
p429
aVand he can show my mom his phone,
p430
aVand she can tap it with her phone,
p431
aVand it will come up with green if he really is from British Gas
p432
aVand allowed in,
p433
aVand it'll come up with red if he isn't,
p434

VWe have the technology to do that.
p437
aVAnd what's more,
p438
aValthough some of those things sounded a bit counter-intuitive,
p439
aVlike proving I'm over 18 without proving who I am,
p440
aVthe cryptography to do that not only exists,
p441
aVit's extremely well-known and well-understood.
p442
aVDigital signatures, the blinding of public key certificates,
p443
aVthese technologies have been around for a while,
p444
aVwe've just had no way of packaging them up.
p445
aVSo the technology already exists.
p446
aVWe know it works,
p447
aVThere are a few examples of the technology being used
p448
aVin experimental places.
p449
aVThat's London Fashion Week,
p450
aVwhere we built a system with O2,
p451
aVthat's for the Wireless Festival in Hyde Park,
p452
aVyou can see the persons
p453
aVwalking in with their VIP band,
p454
aVit's just being checked
p455
aVby the Nokia phone that's reading the band.
p456
aVI'm only putting those up to show you
p457
aVthese things are prosaic,
p458
aVthis stuff works in these environments.
p459
aVThey don't need to be special.

VSo finally, I know that you can do this,
p462
aVbecause if you saw the episode of Doctor Who,
p463
aVthe Easter special of Doctor Who,
p464
aVwhere he went to Mars in a bus,
p465
aVI should say again for our foreign students,
p466
aVthat doesn't happen every episode.
p467
aVThis was a very special case.
p468
aVSo in the episode where he goes to Mars in a London bus,
p469
aVI can't show you the clip,
p470
aVdue to the outrageous restrictions of Queen Anne-style copyright
p471
aVby the BBC,
p472
aVbut in the episode where he goes to Mars in a London bus,
p473
aVDoctor Who is clearly shown getting on to the bus
p474
aVwith the Oyster card reader
p475
aVusing his psychic paper.
p476
aVWhich proves that psychic paper
p477
aVhas an MSE interface.
p478
aVThank you very much.
