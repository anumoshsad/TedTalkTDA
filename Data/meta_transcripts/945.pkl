VWe live on a human-dominated planet,
p4
aVputting unprecedented pressure
p5
aVon the systems on Earth.
p6
aVThis is bad news, but perhaps surprising to you,
p7
aVit's also part of the good news.
p8
aVWe're the first generation \u2014 thanks to science \u2014
p9
aVto be informed that we may be
p10
aVundermining the stability and the ability
p11
aVof planet Earth
p12
aVto support human development as we know it.
p13
aVIt's also good news, because the planetary risks we're facing
p14
aVare so large,
p15
aVthat business as usual is not an option.
p16
aVIn fact, we're in a phase
p17
aVwhere transformative change is necessary,
p18
aVwhich opens the window for innovation,
p19
aVfor new ideas and new paradigms.
p20
aVThis is a scientific journey on the challenges facing humanity
p21
aVin the global phase of sustainability.
p22
aa(lp23
VOn this journey, I'd like to bring, apart from yourselves,
p24
aVa good friend,
p25
aVa stakeholder, who's always absent
p26
aVwhen we deal with the negotiations on environmental issues,
p27
aVa stakeholder who refuses to compromise \u2014
p28
aVplanet Earth.
p29
aVSo I thought I'd bring her with me today on stage,
p30
aVto have her as a witness
p31
aVof a remarkable journey,
p32
aVwhich humbly reminds us
p33
aVof the period of grace we've had
p34
aVover the past 10,000 years.
p35
aVThis is the living conditions on the planet over the last 100,000 years.
p36
aVIt's a very important period \u2014
p37
aVit's roughly half the period when we've been fully modern humans on the planet.
p38
aVWe've had the same, roughly, abilities
p39
aVthat developed civilizations as we know it.
p40
aVThis is the environmental conditions on the planet.
p41
aa(lp42
VHere, used as a proxy, temperature variability.
p43
aVIt was a jumpy ride. 80,000 years back in a crisis,
p44
aVwe leave Africa, we colonize Australia
p45
aVin another crisis, 60,000 years back,
p46
aVwe leave Asia for Europe
p47
aVin another crisis, 40,000 years back,
p48
aVand then we enter
p49
aVthe remarkably stable Holocene phase,
p50
aVthe only period in the whole history of the planet,
p51
aVthat we know of, that can support human development.
p52
aVA thousand years into this period,
p53
aVwe abandon our hunting and gathering patterns.
p54
aVWe go from a couple of million people
p55
aVto the seven billion people we are today.
p56
aVThe Mesopotamian culture: we invent agriculture,
p57
aVwe domesticate animals and plants.
p58
aVYou have the Roman, the Greek and the story as you know it.
p59
aVThe only phase, as we know it
p60
aVthat can support humanity.
p61
aa(lp62
VThe trouble is we're putting a quadruple sqeeze
p63
aVon this poor planet,
p64
aVa quadruple sqeeze, which, as its first squeeze,
p65
aVhas population growth of course.
p66
aVNow, this is not only about numbers;
p67
aVthis is not only about the fact that we're seven billion people
p68
aVcommitted to nine billion people, it's an equity issue as well.
p69
aVThe majority of the environmental impacts on the planet
p70
aVhave been caused by the rich minority,
p71
aVthe 20 percent that jumped onto the industrial bandwagon
p72
aVin the mid-18th century.
p73
aVThe majority of the planet,
p74
aVaspiring for development, having the right for development,
p75
aVare in large aspiring for an unsustainable lifestyle,
p76
aVa momentous pressure.
p77
aa(lp78
VThe second pressure on the planet is, of course the climate agenda \u2014
p79
aVthe big issue \u2014 where the policy interpretation of science
p80
aVis that it would be enough
p81
aVto stabilize greenhouse gases at 450 ppm
p82
aVto avoid average temperatures
p83
aVexceeding two degrees,
p84
aVto avoid the risk that we may be destabilizing
p85
aVthe West Antarctic Ice Sheet,
p86
aVholding six meters \u2014 level rising,
p87
aVthe risk of destabilizing the Greenland Ice Sheet,
p88
aVholding another seven meters \u2014 sea level rising.
p89
aVNow, you would have wished the climate pressure
p90
aVto hit a strong planet, a resilient planet,
p91
aVbut unfortunately, the third pressure
p92
aVis the ecosystem decline.
p93
aVNever have we seen, in the past 50 years,
p94
aVsuch a sharp decline
p95
aVof ecosystem functions and services on the planet,
p96
aVone of them being the ability to regulate climate on the long term,
p97
aVin our forests, land and biodiversity.
p98
aa(lp99
VThe forth pressure is surprise,
p100
aVthe notion and the evidence
p101
aVthat we need to abandon our old paradigm,
p102
aVthat ecosystems behave linearly, predictably,
p103
aVcontrollably in our \u2014 so to say \u2014 linear systems,
p104
aVand that in fact, surprise is universal,
p105
aVas systems tip over very rapidly, abruptly
p106
aVand often irreversibly.
p107
aVThis, dear friends, poses a human pressure on the planet
p108
aVof momentous scale.
p109
aVWe may, in fact, have entered a new geological era \u2014
p110
aVthe Anthropocene,
p111
aVwhere humans are the predominant driver of change
p112
aVat a planetary level.
p113
aa(lp114
VNow, as a scientist,
p115
aVwhat's the evidence for this?
p116
aVWell, the evidence is,
p117
aVunfortunately, ample.
p118
aVIt's not only carbon dioxide
p119
aVthat has this hockey stick pattern of accelerated change.
p120
aVYou can take virtually any parameter
p121
aVthat matters for human well-being \u2014
p122
aVnitrous oxide, methane,
p123
aVdeforestation, overfishing
p124
aVland degredation, loss of species \u2014
p125
aVthey all show the same pattern
p126
aVover the past 200 years.
p127
aVSimultaneously, they branch off in the mid-50s,
p128
aV10 years after the Second World War,
p129
aVshowing very clearly that the great acceleration of the human enterprise
p130
aVstarts in the mid-50s.
p131
aVYou see, for the first time, an imprint on the global level.
p132
aVAnd I can tell you,
p133
aVyou enter the disciplinary research in each of these,
p134
aVyou find something remarkably important,
p135
aVthe conclusion that we may have come to the point
p136
aVwhere we have to bend the curves,
p137
aVthat we may have entered the most challenging and exciting decade
p138
aVin the history humanity on the planet,
p139
aVthe decade when we have to bend the curves.
p140
aa(lp141
VNow, as if this was not enough \u2014
p142
aVto just bend the curves and understanding the accelerated pressure on the planet \u2014
p143
aVwe also have to recognize the fact
p144
aVthat systems do have multiple stable states,
p145
aVseparated by thresholds \u2014 illustrated here by this ball and cup diagram,
p146
aVwhere the depth of the cup is the resilience of the system.
p147
aVNow, the system may gradually \u2014
p148
aVunder pressure of climate change,
p149
aVerosion, biodiversity loss \u2014
p150
aVlose the depth of the cup, the resilience,
p151
aVbut appear to be healthy
p152
aVand appear to suddenly, under a threshold,
p153
aVbe tipping over. Upff.
p154
aVSorry. Changing state
p155
aVand literally ending up
p156
aVin an undesired situation,
p157
aVwhere new biophysical logic takes over,
p158
aVnew species take over, and the system gets locked.
p159
aa(lp160
VDo we have evidence of this? Yes, coral reef systems.
p161
aVBiodiverse, low-nutrient, hard coral systems
p162
aVunder multiple pressures of overfishing,
p163
aVunsustainable tourism, climate change.
p164
aVA trigger and the system tips over,
p165
aVloses its resilience,
p166
aVsoft corals take over,
p167
aVand we get undesired systems
p168
aVthat cannot support economic and social development.
p169
aVThe Arctic \u2014 a beautiful system \u2014
p170
aVa regulating biome at the planetary level,
p171
aVtaking the knock after knock on climate change,
p172
aVappearing to be in a good state.
p173
aVNo scientist could predict that in 2007,
p174
aVsuddenly, what could be crossing a threshold.
p175
aVThe system suddenly, very surprisingly, loses 30 to 40 percent
p176
aVof its summer ice cover.
p177
aVAnd the drama is, of course, that
p178
aVwhen the system does this, the logic may change.
p179
aVIt may get locked in an undesired state,
p180
aVbecause it changes color, absorbs more energy,
p181
aVand the system may get stuck.
p182
aVIn my mind, the largest red flag warning for humanity
p183
aVthat we are in a precarious situation.
p184
aVAs a sideline, you know that the only red flag that popped up here
p185
aVwas a submarine from an unnamed country
p186
aVthat planted a red flag at the bottom of the Arctic
p187
aVto be able to control the oil resources.
p188
aa(lp189
VNow, if we have evidence, which we now have,
p190
aVthat wetlands, forests,
p191
aV[unclear] monsoon system, the rainforests,
p192
aVbehave in this nonlinear way.
p193
aV30 or so scientists around the world
p194
aVgathered and asked a question for the first time,
p195
aV"Do we have to put the planet into the the pot?"
p196
aVSo we have to ask ourselves:
p197
aVare we threatening this extraordinarily stable Holocene state?
p198
aVAre we in fact putting ourselves in a situation
p199
aVwhere we're coming too close
p200
aVto thresholds that could lead
p201
aVto deleterious and very undesired,
p202
aVif now catastrophic, change
p203
aVfor human development?
p204
aVYou know, you don't want to stand there.
p205
aVIn fact, you're not even allowed to stand
p206
aVwhere this gentleman is standing,
p207
aVat the foaming, slippery waters at the threshold.
p208
aVIn fact, there's a fence
p209
aVquite upstream of this threshold,
p210
aVbeyond which you are in a danger zone.
p211
aVAnd this is the new paradigm,
p212
aVwhich we gathered two, three years back,
p213
aVrecognizing that our old paradigm
p214
aVof just analyzing and pushing and predicting
p215
aVparameters into the future,
p216
aVaiming at minimalizing environmental impacts, is of the past.
p217
aa(lp218
VNow we to ask ourselves:
p219
aVwhich are the large environmental processes
p220
aVthat we have to be stewards of
p221
aVto keep ourselves safe in the Holocene?
p222
aVAnd could we even,
p223
aVthanks to major advancements in Earth systems science,
p224
aVidentify the thresholds,
p225
aVthe points where we may expect nonlinear change?
p226
aVAnd could we even define
p227
aVa planetary boundary, a fence,
p228
aVwithin which we then have a safe operating space for humanity?
p229
aVThis work, which was published in "Nature,"
p230
aVlate 2009,
p231
aVafter a number of years of analysis,
p232
aVled to the final proposition
p233
aVthat we can only find
p234
aVnine planetary boundaries
p235
aVwith which, under active stewardship,
p236
aVwould allow ourselves to have a safe operating space.
p237
aVThese include, of course, climate.
p238
aVIt may surprise you that it's not only climate.
p239
aVBut it shows that we are interconnected, among many systems on the planet,
p240
aVwith the three big systems, climate change,
p241
aVstratospheric ozone depletion and ocean acidification
p242
aVbeing the three big systems,
p243
aVwhere the scientific evidence of large-scale thresholds
p244
aVin the paleo-record of the history of the planet.
p245
aa(lp246
VBut we also include, what we call, the slow variables,
p247
aVthe systems that, under the hood,
p248
aVregulate and buffer the capacity of the resilience of the planet \u2014
p249
aVthe interference of the big nitrogen and phosphorus cycles on the planet,
p250
aVland use change, rate of biodiversity loss,
p251
aVfreshwater use,
p252
aVfunctions which regulate
p253
aVbiomass on the planet, carbon sequestration, diversity.
p254
aVAnd then we have two parameters which we were not able to quantify \u2014
p255
aVair pollution,
p256
aVincluding warming gases and air-polluting sulfates and nitrates,
p257
aVbut also chemical pollution.
p258
aVTogether, these form an integrated whole
p259
aVfor guiding human development in the Anthropocene,
p260
aVunderstanding that the planet
p261
aVis a complex self-regulating system.
p262
aVIn fact, most evidence indicates
p263
aVthat these nine may behave as three Musketeers,
p264
aV"One for all. All for one."
p265
aVYou degrade forests, you go beyond the boundary on land,
p266
aVyou undermine the ability of the climate system
p267
aVto stay stable.
p268
aVThe drama here is, in fact, that
p269
aVit may show that the climate challenge
p270
aVis the easy one,
p271
aVif you consider the whole challenge
p272
aVof sustainable development.
p273
aa(lp274
VNow this is the Big Bang equivalent then of human development
p275
aVwithin the safe operating space of the planetary boundaries.
p276
aVWhat you see here in black line is the safe operating space,
p277
aVthe quantified boundaries,
p278
aVas suggested by this analysis.
p279
aVThe yellow dot in the middle here is our starting point,
p280
aVthe pre-industrial point,
p281
aVwhere we're very safely in the safe operating space.
p282
aVIn the '50s, we start branching out.
p283
aVIn the '60s already, through the green revolution
p284
aVand the Haber-Bosch process
p285
aVof fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere \u2014
p286
aVyou know, human's today take out more nitrogen from the atmosphere
p287
aVthan the whole biosphere does naturally as a whole.
p288
aVWe don't transgress the climate boundary until the early '90s,
p289
aVactually, right after Rio.
p290
aVAnd today, we are in a situation where we estimate
p291
aVthat we've transgressed three boundaries,
p292
aVthe rate of biodiversity loss,
p293
aVwhich is the sixth extinction period in the history of humanity \u2014
p294
aVone of them being the extinctions of the dinosaurs \u2014
p295
aVnitrogen and climate change.
p296
aVBut we still have some degrees of freedom on the others,
p297
aVbut we are approaching fast
p298
aVon land, water, phosphorus and oceans.
p299
aVBut this gives a new paradigm
p300
aVto guide humanity,
p301
aVto put the light on our, so far
p302
aVoverpowered industrial vehicle,
p303
aVwhich operates as if
p304
aVwe're only on a dark, straight highway.
p305
aa(lp306
VNow the question then is:
p307
aVhow gloomy is this?
p308
aVIs then sustainable development utopia?
p309
aVWell, there's no science to suggest.
p310
aVIn fact, there is ample science
p311
aVto indicate that we can do this transformative change,
p312
aVthat we have the ability
p313
aVto now move into a new innovative,
p314
aVa transformative gear,
p315
aVacross scales.
p316
aVThe drama is, of course,
p317
aVis that 200 countries on this planet
p318
aVhave to simultaneously start moving
p319
aVin the same direction.
p320
aVBut it changes fundamentally our governance and management paradigm,
p321
aVfrom the current linear,
p322
aVcommand and control thinking,
p323
aVlooking at efficiencies and optimization
p324
aVtowards a much more flexible,
p325
aVa much more adaptive approach,
p326
aVwhere we recognize that redundancy,
p327
aVboth in social and environmental systems,
p328
aVis key to be able to deal
p329
aVwith a turbulent era of global change.
p330
aVWe have to invest in persistence,
p331
aVin the ability of social systems and ecological systems
p332
aVto withstand shocks and still remain in that desired cup.
p333
aVWe have to invest in transformations capability,
p334
aVmoving from crisis into innovation
p335
aVand the ability to rise after a crisis,
p336
aVand of course to adapt to unavoidable change.
p337
aVThis is a new paradigm.
p338
aVWe're not doing that at any scale on governance.
p339
aa(lp340
VBut is it happening anywhere?
p341
aVDo we have any examples of success
p342
aVon this mind shift being applied at the local level?
p343
aVWell, yes, in fact we do
p344
aVand the list can start becoming longer and longer.
p345
aVThere's good news here,
p346
aVfor example, from Latin America,
p347
aVwhere plow-based farming systems
p348
aVof the '50s and '60s
p349
aVled farming basically to a dead-end,
p350
aVwith lower and lower yields, degrading the organic matter
p351
aVand fundamental problems at the livelihood levels
p352
aVin Paraguay, Uruguay and a number of countries, Brazil,
p353
aVleading to innovation and entrepreneurship
p354
aVamong farmers in partnership with scientists
p355
aVinto an agricultural revolution of zero tillage systems
p356
aVcombined with mulch farming
p357
aVwith locally adapted technologies,
p358
aVwhich today, for example, in some countries,
p359
aVhave led to a tremendous increase
p360
aVin area under mulch, zero till farming
p361
aVwhich, not only produces more food,
p362
aVbut also sequesters carbon.
p363
aa(lp364
VThe Australian Great Barrier Reef is another success story.
p365
aVUnder the realization from tourist operators,
p366
aVfishermen,
p367
aVthe Australian Great Barrier Reef Authority and scientists
p368
aVthat the Great Barrier Reef is doomed
p369
aVunder the current governance regime.
p370
aVGlobal change, beautification rack culture,
p371
aVoverfishing and unsustainable tourism,
p372
aVall together placing this system
p373
aVin the realization of crisis.
p374
aVBut the window of opportunity was innovation and new mindset,
p375
aVwhich today has led to a completely new governance strategy
p376
aVto build resilience,
p377
aVacknowledge redundancy
p378
aVand invest in the whole system as an integrated whole,
p379
aVand then allow for much more redundancy in the system.
p380
aa(lp381
VSweden, the country I come from, has other examples,
p382
aVwhere wetlands in southern Sweden were seen as \u2014
p383
aVas in many countries \u2014 as flood-prone polluted nuisance
p384
aVin the peri-urban regions.
p385
aVBut again, a crisis, new partnerships,
p386
aVactors locally, transforming these
p387
aVinto a key component
p388
aVof sustainable urban planning.
p389
aVSo crisis leading into opportunities.
p390
aa(lp391
VNow, what about the future?
p392
aVWell, the future, of course, has one massive challenge,
p393
aVwhich is feeding a world of nine billion people.
p394
aVWe need nothing less than a new green revolution,
p395
aVand the planet boundaries shows
p396
aVthat agriculture has to go from a source of greenhouse gases to a sink.
p397
aVIt has to basically do this on current land.
p398
aVWe cannot expand anymore,
p399
aVbecause it erodes the planetary boundaries.
p400
aVWe cannot continue consuming water as we do today,
p401
aVwith 25 percent of world rivers not even reaching the ocean.
p402
aVAnd we need a transformation.
p403
aVWell, interestingly, and based on my work
p404
aVand others in Africa, for example,
p405
aVwe've shown that even the most vulnerable small-scale rainfall farming systems,
p406
aVwith innovations and supplementary irrigation
p407
aVto bridge dry spells and droughts,
p408
aVsustainable sanitation systems to close the loop on nutrients
p409
aVfrom toilets back to farmers' fields,
p410
aVand innovations in tillage systems,
p411
aVwe can triple, quadruple, yield levels
p412
aVon current land.
p413
aa(lp414
VElinor Ostrom,
p415
aVthe latest Nobel laureate of economics,
p416
aVclearly shows empirically across the world
p417
aVthat we can govern the commons
p418
aVif we invest in trust,
p419
aVlocal, action-based partnerships
p420
aVand cross-scale institutional innovations,
p421
aVwhere local actors,
p422
aVtogether, can deal with the global commons
p423
aVat a large scale.
p424
aVBut even on the hard policy area we have innovations.
p425
aVWe know that we have to move from our fossil dependence
p426
aVvery quickly into a low-carbon economy in record time.
p427
aVAnd what shall we do?
p428
aVEverybody talks about carbon taxes \u2014 it won't work \u2014 emission schemes,
p429
aVbut for example, one policy measure,
p430
aVfeed-in tariffs on the energy system,
p431
aVwhich is already applied,
p432
aVfrom China doing it on offshore wind systems,
p433
aVall the way to the U.S.
p434
aVwhere you give the guaranteed price for investment in renewable energy,
p435
aVbut you can subsidize electricity to poor people.
p436
aVYou get people out of poverty.
p437
aVYou solve the climate issue with regards to the energy sector,
p438
aVwhile at the same time, stimulating innovation \u2014
p439
aVexamples of things that can be out scaled quickly
p440
aVat the planetary level.
p441
aa(lp442
VSo there is \u2014 no doubt \u2014 opportunity here,
p443
aVand we can list many, many examples
p444
aVof transformative opportunities around the planet.
p445
aVThe key though in all of these,
p446
aVthe red thread,
p447
aVis the shift in mindset,
p448
aVmoving away from a situation where we simply are pushing ourselves
p449
aVinto a dark future,
p450
aVwhere we instead backcast our future,
p451
aVand we say, "What is the playing field on the planet?
p452
aVWhat are the planetary boundaries
p453
aVwithin which we can safely operate?"
p454
aVand then backtrack innovations within that.
p455
aVBut of course, the drama is, it clearly shows
p456
aVthat incremental change is not an option.
p457
aa(lp458
VSo, there is scientific evidence.
p459
aVThey sort of say the harsh news,
p460
aVthat we are facing the largest
p461
aVtransformative development
p462
