VI am going to speak about corruption,
p4
aVbut I would like to juxtapose
p5
aVtwo different things.
p6
aVOne is the large global economy,
p7
aVthe large globalized economy,
p8
aVand the other one is the small, and very limited,
p9
aVcapacity of our traditional governments
p10
aVand their international institutions
p11
aVto govern, to shape, this economy.
p12
aVBecause there is this asymmetry,
p13
aVwhich creates, basically,
p14
aVfailing governance.
p15
aVFailing governance in many areas:
p16
aVin the area of corruption and the area of destruction of the environment,
p17
aVin the area of exploitation of women and children,
p18
aVin the area of climate change,
p19
aVin all the areas in which we really need
p20
aVa capacity to reintroduce
p21
aVthe primacy of politics
p22
aVinto the economy,
p23
aVwhich is operating in a worldwide arena.
p24
aVAnd I think corruption,
p25
aVand the fight against corruption,
p26
aVand the impact of corruption,
p27
aVis probably one of the most interesting ways
p28
aVto illustrate what I mean
p29
aVwith this failure of governance.
p30
aa(lp31
VLet me talk about my own experience.
p32
aVI used to work as the director
p33
aVof the World Bank office in Nairobi
p34
aVfor East Africa.
p35
aVAt that time, I noticed
p36
aVthat corruption, that grand corruption,
p37
aVthat systematic corruption,
p38
aVwas undermining everything we were trying to do.
p39
aVAnd therefore, I began
p40
aVto not only try to protect
p41
aVthe work of the World Bank,
p42
aVour own projects, our own programs
p43
aVagainst corruption,
p44
aVbut in general, I thought, "We need a system
p45
aVto protect the people
p46
aVin this part of the world
p47
aVfrom the ravages of corruption."
p48
aVAnd as soon as I started this work,
p49
aVI received a memorandum from the World Bank,
p50
aVfrom the legal department first,
p51
aVin which they said, "You are not allowed to do this.
p52
aVYou are meddling in the internal affairs of our partner countries.
p53
aVThis is forbidden by the charter of the World Bank,
p54
aVso I want you to stop your doings."
p55
aa(lp56
VIn the meantime, I was chairing
p57
aVdonor meetings, for instance,
p58
aVin which the various donors,
p59
aVand many of them like to be in Nairobi \u2014
p60
aVit is true, it is one of the
p61
aVunsafest cities of the world,
p62
aVbut they like to be there because the other cities
p63
aVare even less comfortable.
p64
aVAnd in these donor meetings, I noticed
p65
aVthat many of the worst projects \u2014
p66
aVwhich were put forward
p67
aVby our clients, by the governments,
p68
aVby promoters,
p69
aVmany of them representing
p70
aVsuppliers from the North \u2014
p71
aVthat the worst projects
p72
aVwere realized first.
p73
aVLet me give you an example:
p74
aVa huge power project,
p75
aV300 million dollars,
p76
aVto be built smack into
p77
aVone of the most vulnerable, and one of the most beautiful,
p78
aVareas of western Kenya.
p79
aVAnd we all noticed immediately
p80
aVthat this project had no economic benefits:
p81
aVIt had no clients, nobody would buy the electricity there,
p82
aVnobody was interested in irrigation projects.
p83
aVTo the contrary, we knew that this project
p84
aVwould destroy the environment:
p85
aVIt would destroy riparian forests,
p86
aVwhich were the basis for
p87
aVthe survival of nomadic groups,
p88
aVthe Samburu and the Turkana in this area.
p89
aVSo everybody knew this is a, not a useless project,
p90
aVthis is an absolute damaging, a terrible project \u2014
p91
aVnot to speak about the future indebtedness of the country
p92
aVfor these hundreds of millions of dollars,
p93
aVand the siphoning off
p94
aVof the scarce resources of the economy
p95
aVfrom much more important activities
p96
aVlike schools, like hospitals and so on.
p97
aVAnd yet, we all rejected this project,
p98
aVnone of the donors was willing
p99
aVto have their name connected with it,
p100
aVand it was the first project to be implemented.
p101
aa(lp102
VThe good projects, which we as a donor community
p103
aVwould take under our wings,
p104
aVthey took years, you know,
p105
aVyou had too many studies,
p106
aVand very often they didn't succeed.
p107
aVBut these bad projects,
p108
aVwhich were absolutely damaging \u2014 for the economy
p109
aVfor many generations, for the environment,
p110
aVfor thousands of families who had to be resettled \u2014
p111
aVthey were suddenly put together
p112
aVby consortia of banks,
p113
aVof supplier agencies,
p114
aVof insurance agencies \u2014
p115
aVlike in Germany, Hermes, and so on \u2014
p116
aVand they came back very, very quickly,
p117
aVdriven by an unholy alliance
p118
aVbetween the powerful elites
p119
aVin the countries there
p120
aVand the suppliers from the North.
p121
aVNow, these suppliers
p122
aVwere our big companies.
p123
aVThey were the actors of this global market,
p124
aVwhich I mentioned in the beginning.
p125
aVThey were the Siemenses of this world,
p126
aVcoming from France, from the UK, from Japan,
p127
aVfrom Canada, from Germany,
p128
aVand they were systematically driven
p129
aVby systematic, large-scale corruption.
p130
aVWe are not talking about
p131
aV50,000 dollars here,
p132
aVor 100,000 dollars there, or one million dollars there.
p133
aVNo, we are talking about 10 million, 20 million dollars
p134
aVon the Swiss bank accounts,
p135
aVon the bank accounts of Liechtenstein,
p136
aVof the president's ministers,
p137
aVthe high officials in the para-statal sectors.
p138
aa(lp139
VThis was the reality which I saw,
p140
aVand not only one project like that:
p141
aVI saw, I would say,
p142
aVover the years I worked in Africa,
p143
aVI saw hundreds of projects like this.
p144
aVAnd so, I became convinced
p145
aVthat it is this systematic corruption
p146
aVwhich is perverting economic policy-making in these countries,
p147
aVwhich is the main reason
p148
aVfor the misery, for the poverty,
p149
aVfor the conflicts, for the violence,
p150
aVfor the desperation
p151
aVin many of these countries.
p152
aVThat we have today
p153
aVmore than a billion people below the absolute poverty line,
p154
aVthat we have more than a billion people
p155
aVwithout proper drinking water in the world,
p156
aVtwice that number,
p157
aVmore than two billion people
p158
aVwithout sanitation and so on,
p159
aVand the consequent illnesses
p160
aVof mothers and children,
p161
aVstill, child mortality of more than
p162
aV10 million people every year,
p163
aVchildren dying before they are five years old:
p164
aVThe cause of this is, to a large extent,
p165
aVgrand corruption.
p166
aa(lp167
VNow, why did the World Bank
p168
aVnot let me do this work?
p169
aVI found out afterwards,
p170
aVafter I left, under a big fight, the World Bank.
p171
aVThe reason was that the members of the World Bank
p172
aVthought that foreign bribery was okay,
p173
aVincluding Germany.
p174
aVIn Germany, foreign bribery was allowed.
p175
aVIt was even tax-deductible.
p176
aVNo wonder that most of the most important
p177
aVinternational operators in Germany,
p178
aVbut also in France and the UK
p179
aVand Scandinavia, everywhere, systematically bribed.
p180
aVNot all of them, but most of them.
p181
aVAnd this is the phenomenon
p182
aVwhich I call failing governance,
p183
aVbecause when I then came to Germany
p184
aVand started this little NGO
p185
aVhere in Berlin, at the Villa Borsig,
p186
aVwe were told, "You cannot stop
p187
aVour German exporters from bribing,
p188
aVbecause we will lose our contracts.
p189
aVWe will lose to the French,
p190
aVwe will lose to the Swedes, we'll lose to the Japanese."
p191
aVAnd therefore, there was a indeed a prisoner's dilemma,
p192
aVwhich made it very difficult
p193
aVfor an individual company,
p194
aVan individual exporting country
p195
aVto say, "We are not going to
p196
aVcontinue this deadly, disastrous
p197
aVhabit of large companies to bribe."
p198
aa(lp199
VSo this is what I mean
p200
aVwith a failing governance structure,
p201
aVbecause even the powerful government,
p202
aVwhich we have in Germany, comparatively,
p203
aVwas not able to say,
p204
aV"We will not allow our companies to bribe abroad."
p205
aVThey needed help,
p206
aVand the large companies themselves
p207
aVhave this dilemma.
p208
aVMany of them didn't want to bribe.
p209
aVMany of the German companies, for instance,
p210
aVbelieve that they are really
p211
aVproducing a high-quality product
p212
aVat a good price, so they are very competitive.
p213
aVThey are not as good at bribing
p214
aVas many of their international competitors are,
p215
aVbut they were not allowed
p216
aVto show their strengths,
p217
aVbecause the world was eaten up
p218
aVby grand corruption.
p219
aa(lp220
VAnd this is why I'm telling you this:
p221
aVCivil society rose to the occasion.
p222
aVWe had this small NGO,
p223
aVTransparency International.
p224
aVThey began to think of
p225
aVan escape route from this prisoner's dilemma,
p226
aVand we developed concepts
p227
aVof collective action,
p228
aVbasically trying to bring various competitors
p229
aVtogether around the table,
p230
aVexplaining to all of them
p231
aVhow much it would be in their interests
p232
aVif they simultaneously would stop bribing,
p233
aVand to make a long story short,
p234
aVwe managed to eventually
p235
aVget Germany to sign
p236
aVtogether with the other OECD countries
p237
aVand a few other exporters.
p238
aa(lp239
VIn 1997, a convention,
p240
aVunder the auspices of the OECD,
p241
aVwhich obliged everybody
p242
aVto change their laws
p243
aVand criminalize foreign bribery.
p244
aV(Applause)
p245
aVWell, thank you. I mean, it's interesting,
p246
aVin doing this,
p247
aVwe had to sit together with the companies.
p248
aVWe had here in Berlin, at the Aspen Institute on the Wannsee,
p249
aVwe had sessions with about
p250
aV20 captains of industry,
p251
aVand we discussed with them
p252
aVwhat to do about international bribery.
p253
aVIn the first session \u2014 we had three sessions
p254
aVover the course of two years.
p255
aVAnd President von Weizsäcker, by the way,
p256
aVchaired one of the sessions, the first one,
p257
aVto take the fear away
p258
aVfrom the entrepreneurs,
p259
aVwho were not used to deal
p260
aVwith non-governmental organizations.
p261
aVAnd in the first session, they all said,
p262
aV"This is not bribery, what we are doing." This is customary there.
p263
aVThis is what these other cultures demand.
p264
aVThey even applaud it.
p265
aVIn fact, [unclear]
p266
aVstill says this today.
p267
aVAnd so there are still a lot of people
p268
aVwho are not convinced that you have to stop bribing.
p269
aVBut in the second session,
p270
aVthey admitted already that they would never do this,
p271
aVwhat they are doing in these other countries,
p272
aVhere in Germany, or in the U.K., and so on.
p273
aVCabinet ministers would admit this.
p274
aVAnd in the final session, at the Aspen Institute,
p275
aVwe had them all sign an open letter
p276
aVto the Kohl government, at the time,
p277
aVrequesting that they
p278
aVparticipate in the OECD convention.
p279
aa(lp280
VAnd this is, in my opinion,
p281
aVan example of soft power,
p282
aVbecause we were able to convince them
p283
aVthat they had to go with us.
p284
aVWe had a longer-term time perspective.
p285
aVWe had a broader,
p286
aVgeographically much wider,
p287
aVconstituency we were trying to defend.
p288
aVAnd that's why the law has changed.
p289
aVThat's why Siemens is now in the trouble they are in
p290
aVand that's why MIN is in the trouble they are in.
p291
aVIn some other countries, the OECD convention
p292
aVis not yet properly enforced.
p293
aVAnd, again, civil societies
p294
aVbreathing down the neck of the establishment.
p295
aa(lp296
VIn London, for instance,
p297
aVwhere the BAE got away
p298
aVwith a huge corruption case,
p299
aVwhich the Serious Fraud Office tried to prosecute,
p300
aV100 million British pounds,
p301
aVevery year for ten years,
p302
aVto one particular official of one particular friendly country,
p303
aVwho then bought for
p304
aV44 billion pounds of military equipment.
p305
aVThis case, they are not prosecuting in the UK.
p306
aVWhy? Because they consider this
p307
aVas contrary to the security interest
p308
aVof the people of Great Britain.
p309
aVCivil society is pushing, civil society
p310
aVis trying to get a solution to this problem,
p311
aValso in the U.K.,
p312
aVand also in Japan, which is not properly enforcing,
p313
aVand so on.
p314
aa(lp315
VIn Germany, we are pushing
p316
aVthe ratification of the UN convention,
p317
aVwhich is a subsequent convention.
p318
aVWe are, Germany, is not ratifying.
p319
aVWhy? Because it would make it necessary
p320
aVto criminalize the corruption
p321
aVof deputies.
p322
aVIn Germany, we have a system where
p323
aVyou are not allowed to bribe a civil servant,
p324
aVbut you are allowed to bribe a deputy.
p325
aVThis is, under German law, allowed,
p326
aVand the members of our parliament don't want to change this,
p327
aVand this is why they can't sign
p328
aVthe U.N. convention against foreign bribery \u2014
p329
aVone of they very, very few countries
p330
aVwhich is preaching honesty and good governance everywhere in the world,
p331
aVbut not able to ratify the convention,
p332
aVwhich we managed to get on the books
p333
aVwith about 160 countries all over the world.
p334
aa(lp335
VI see my time is ticking.
p336
aVLet me just try to
p337
aVdraw some conclusions from what has happened.
p338
aVI believe that what we managed to achieve
p339
aVin fighting corruption,
p340
aVone can also achieve
p341
aVin other areas of failing governance.
p342
aVBy now, the United Nations
p343
aVis totally on our side.
p344
aVThe World Bank has turned from Saulus to Paulus; under Wolfensohn,
p345
aVthey became, I would say, the strongest
p346
aVanti-corruption agency in the world.
p347
aVMost of the large companies
p348
aVare now totally convinced
p349
aVthat they have to put in place
p350
aVvery strong policies
p351
aVagainst bribery and so on.
p352
aVAnd this is possible because civil society
p353
aVjoined the companies
p354
aVand joined the government
p355
aVin the analysis of the problem,
p356
aVin the development of remedies,
p357
aVin the implementation of reforms,
p358
aVand then later, in the monitoring of reforms.
p359
aa(lp360
VOf course, if civil society organizations
p361
aVwant to play that role,
p362
aVthey have to grow into this responsibility.
p363
aVNot all civil society organizations are good.
p364
aVThe Ku Klux Klan is an NGO.
p365
aVSo, we must be aware
p366
aVthat civil society
p367
aVhas to shape up itself.
p368
aVThey have to have a much more
p369
aVtransparent financial governance.
p370
aVThey have to have a much more participatory governance
p371
aVin many civil society organizations.
p372
aVWe also need much more competence of civil society leaders.
p373
aVThis is why we have set up the governance school
p374
aVand the Center for Civil Society here in Berlin,
p375
aVbecause we believe most of our educational
p376
aVand research institutions in Germany
p377
aVand continental Europe in general,
p378
aVdo not focus enough, yet,
p379
aVon empowering civil society
p380
aVand training the leadership of civil society.
p381
aa(lp382
VBut what I'm saying from my very practical experience:
p383
aVIf civil society does it right
p384
aVand joins the other actors \u2014
p385
aVin particular, governments,
p386
aVgovernments and their international institutions,
p387
aVbut also large international actors,
p388
aVin particular those which have committed themselves
p389
aVto corporate social responsibility \u2014
p390
aVthen in this magical triangle
p391
aVbetween civil society,
p392
aVgovernment and private sector,
p393
aVthere is a tremendous chance
p394
aVfor all of us to create a better world.
p395
