VGood morning.
p4
aVWhen I was a little boy,
p5
aVI had an experience that changed my life,
p6
aVand is in fact why I'm here today.
p7
aVThat one moment
p8
aVprofoundly affected how I think about
p9
aVart, design and engineering.
p10
aa(lp11
VAs background, I was fortunate enough to grow up
p12
aVin a family of loving and talented artists
p13
aVin one of the world's great cities.
p14
aVMy dad, John Ferren, who died when I was 15,
p15
aVwas an artist by both passion and profession,
p16
aVas is my mom, Rae.
p17
aVHe was one of the New York School
p18
aVabstract expressionists who,
p19
aVtogether with his contemporaries,
p20
aVinvented American modern art,
p21
aVand contributed to moving the American zeitgeist
p22
aVtowards modernism in the 20th century.
p23
aVIsn't it remarkable that, after thousands of years
p24
aVof people doing mostly representational art,
p25
aVthat modern art, comparatively speaking,
p26
aVis about 15 minutes old,
p27
aVyet now pervasive.
p28
aVAs with many other important innovations,
p29
aVthose radical ideas required no new technology,
p30
aVjust fresh thinking and a willingness to experiment,
p31
aVplus resiliency in the face of near-universal criticism
p32
aVand rejection.
p33
aVIn our home, art was everywhere.
p34
aVIt was like oxygen,
p35
aVaround us and necessary for life.
p36
aVAs I watched him paint,
p37
aVDad taught me that art
p38
aVwas not about being decorative,
p39
aVbut was a different way of communicating ideas,
p40
aVand in fact one that could bridge the worlds
p41
aVof knowledge and insight.
p42
aa(lp43
VGiven this rich artistic environment,
p44
aVyou'd assume that I would have been compelled
p45
aVto go into the family business,
p46
aVbut no.
p47
aVI followed the path of most kids
p48
aVwho are genetically programmed
p49
aVto make their parents crazy.
p50
aVI had no interest in becoming an artist,
p51
aVcertainly not a painter.
p52
aVWhat I did love was electronics and machines \u2014
p53
aVtaking them apart, building new ones,
p54
aVand making them work.
p55
aVFortunately, my family also had engineers in it,
p56
aVand with my parents,
p57
aVthese were my first role models.
p58
aVWhat they all had in common
p59
aVwas they worked very, very hard.
p60
aVMy grandpa owned and operated a sheet metal
p61
aVkitchen cabinet factory in Brooklyn.
p62
aVOn weekends, we would go together to Cortlandt Street,
p63
aVwhich was New York City's radio row.
p64
aVThere we would explore massive piles
p65
aVof surplus electronics,
p66
aVand for a few bucks bring home treasures
p67
aVlike Norden bombsights
p68
aVand parts from the first IBM tube-based computers.
p69
aVI found these objects both useful and fascinating.
p70
aVI learned about engineering and how things worked,
p71
aVnot at school
p72
aVbut by taking apart and studying
p73
aVthese fabulously complex devices.
p74
aVI did this for hours every day,
p75
aVapparently avoiding electrocution.
p76
aVLife was good.
p77
aa(lp78
VHowever, every summer, sadly,
p79
aVthe machines got left behind
p80
aVwhile my parents and I traveled overseas
p81
aVto experience history, art and design.
p82
aVWe visited the great museums and historic buildings
p83
aVof both Europe and the Middle East,
p84
aVbut to encourage my growing interest
p85
aVin science and technology,
p86
aVthey would simply drop me off in places
p87
aVlike the London Science Museum,
p88
aVwhere I would wander endlessly for hours by myself
p89
aVstudying the history of science and technology.
p90
aa(lp91
VThen, when I was about nine years old,
p92
aVwe went to Rome.
p93
aVOn one particularly hot summer day,
p94
aVwe visited a drum-shaped building that from the outside
p95
aVwas not particularly interesting.
p96
aVMy dad said it was called the Pantheon,
p97
aVa temple for all of the gods.
p98
aVIt didn't look all that special from the outside,
p99
aVas I said, but when we walked inside,
p100
aVI was immediately struck by three things:
p101
aVFirst of all, it was pleasantly cool
p102
aVdespite the oppressive heat outside.
p103
aVIt was very dark, the only source of light
p104
aVbeing an big open hole in the roof.
p105
aVDad explained that this wasn't a big open hole,
p106
aVbut it was called the oculus,
p107
aVan eye to the heavens.
p108
aVAnd there was something about this place,
p109
aVI didn't know why, that just felt special.
p110
aVAs we walked to the center of the room,
p111
aVI looked up at the heavens through the oculus.
p112
aVThis was the first church that I'd been to
p113
aVthat provided an unrestricted view
p114
aVbetween God and man.
p115
aVBut I wondered, what about when it rained?
p116
aVDad may have called this an oculus,
p117
aVbut it was, in fact, a big hole in the roof.
p118
aVI looked down and saw floor drains
p119
aVhad been cut into the stone floor.
p120
aVAs I became more accustomed to the dark,
p121
aVI was able to make out details of the floor
p122
aVand the surrounding walls.
p123
aVNo big deal here, just the same statuary stuff
p124
aVthat we'd seen all over Rome.
p125
aVIn fact, it looked like the Appian Way
p126
aVmarble salesman showed up
p127
aVwith his sample book, showed it to Hadrian,
p128
aVand Hadrian said, "We'll take all of it."
p129
aV(Laughter)
p130
aa(lp131
VBut the ceiling was amazing.
p132
aVIt looked like a Buckminster Fuller geodesic dome.
p133
aVI'd seen these before,
p134
aVand Bucky was friends with my dad.
p135
aVIt was modern, high-tech, impressive,
p136
aVa huge 142-foot clear span
p137
aVwhich, not coincidentally, was exactly its height.
p138
aVI loved this place.
p139
aVIt was really beautiful and unlike anything I'd ever seen before,
p140
aVso I asked my dad, "When was this built?"
p141
aVHe said, "About 2,000 years ago."
p142
aVAnd I said, "No, I mean, the roof."
p143
aVYou see, I assumed that this was a modern roof
p144
aVthat had been put on because the original
p145
aVwas destroyed in some long-past war.
p146
aVHe said, "It's the original roof."
p147
aa(lp148
VThat moment changed my life,
p149
aVand I can remember it as if it were yesterday.
p150
aVFor the first time, I realized people were smart
p151
aV2,000 years ago. (Laughter)
p152
aVThis had never crossed my mind.
p153
aVI mean, to me, the pyramids at Giza,
p154
aVwe visited those the year before,
p155
aVand sure they're impressive, nice enough design,
p156
aVbut look, give me an unlimited budget,
p157
aV20,000 to 40,000 laborers, and about 10 to 20 years
p158
aVto cut and drag stone blocks  across the countryside,
p159
aVand I'll build you pyramids too.
p160
aVBut no amount of brute force
p161
aVgets you the dome of the Pantheon,
p162
aVnot 2,000 years ago, nor today.
p163
aVAnd incidentally, it is still the largest
p164
aVunreinforced concrete dome that's ever been built.
p165
aVTo build the Pantheon took some miracles.
p166
aVBy miracles, I mean things that are
p167
aVtechnically barely possible,
p168
aVvery high-risk, and might not be
p169
aVactually accomplishable at this moment in time,
p170
aVcertainly not by you.
p171
aa(lp172
VFor example, here are some of the Pantheon's miracles.
p173
aVTo make it even structurally possible,
p174
aVthey had to invent super-strong concrete,
p175
aVand to control weight,
p176
aVvaried the density of the aggregate
p177
aVas they worked their way up the dome.
p178
aVFor strength and lightness, the dome structure
p179
aVused five rings of coffers,
p180
aVeach of diminishing size,
p181
aVwhich imparts a dramatic forced perspective
p182
aVto the design.
p183
aVIt was wonderfully cool inside
p184
aVbecause of its huge thermal mass,
p185
aVnatural convection of air rising up
p186
aVthrough the oculus,
p187
aVand a Venturi effect when wind blows across
p188
aVthe top of the building.
p189
aVI discovered for the first time that light itself
p190
aVhas substance.
p191
aVThe shaft of light beaming through the oculus
p192
aVwas both beautiful and palpable,
p193
aVand I realized for the first time
p194
aVthat light could be designed.
p195
aVFurther, that of all of the forms of design,
p196
aVvisual design,
p197
aVthey were all kind of irrelevant without it,
p198
aVbecause without light, you can't see any of them.
p199
aVI also realized that I wasn't the first person
p200
aVto think that this place was really special.
p201
aVIt survived gravity, barbarians, looters, developers
p202
aVand the ravages of time to become
p203
aVwhat I believe is the longest
p204
aVcontinuously occupied building in history.
p205
aa(lp206
VLargely because of that visit,
p207
aVI came to understand that,
p208
aVcontrary to what I was being told in school,
p209
aVthe worlds of art and design
p210
aVwere not, in fact, incompatible
p211
aVwith science and engineering.
p212
aVI realized, when combined,
p213
aVyou could create things that were amazing
p214
aVthat couldn't be done in either domain alone.
p215
aVBut in school, with few exceptions,
p216
aVthey were treated as separate worlds,
p217
aVand they still are.
p218
aVMy teachers told me that I had to get serious
p219
aVand focus on one or the other.
p220
aVHowever, urging me to specialize
p221
aVonly caused me to really  appreciate those polymaths
p222
aVlike Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci,
p223
aVBenjamin Franklin,
p224
aVpeople who did exactly the opposite.
p225
aVAnd this led me to embrace
p226
aVand want to be in both worlds.
p227
aa(lp228
VSo then how do these projects of unprecedented creative vision and technical complexity
p229
aVlike the Pantheon actually happen?
p230
aVSomeone themselves, perhaps Hadrian,
p231
aVneeded a brilliant creative vision.
p232
aVThey also needed the storytelling and leadership skills
p233
aVnecessary to fund and execute it,
p234
aVand a mastery of science and technology
p235
aVwith the ability and knowhow
p236
aVto push existing innovations even farther.
p237
aVIt is my belief that to create these rare game changers
p238
aVrequires you to pull off at least five miracles.
p239
aVThe problem is, no matter how talented,
p240
aVrich or smart you are,
p241
aVyou only get one to one and a half miracles.
p242
aVThat's it. That's the quota.
p243
aVThen you run out of time, money, enthusiasm,
p244
aVwhatever.
p245
aVRemember, most people can't even imagine
p246
aVone of these technical miracles,
p247
aVand you need at least five to make a Pantheon.
p248
aVIn my experience, these rare visionaries
p249
aVwho can think across the worlds of art,
p250
aVdesign and engineering
p251
aVhave the ability to notice
p252
aVwhen others have provided enough of the miracles
p253
aVto bring the goal within reach.
p254
aVDriven by the clarity of their vision,
p255
aVthey summon the courage and determination
p256
aVto deliver the remaining miracles
p257
aVand they often take what other people think to be
p258
aVinsurmountable obstacles
p259
aVand turn them into features.
p260
aVTake the oculus of the Pantheon.
p261
aVBy insisting that it be in the design,
p262
aVit meant you couldn't use much of the structural technology
p263
aVthat had been developed for Roman arches.
p264
aVHowever, by instead embracing it
p265
aVand rethinking weight and stress distribution,
p266
aVthey came up with a design that only works
p267
aVif there's a big hole in the roof.
p268
aVThat done, you now get the aesthetic
p269
aVand design benefits of light, cooling
p270
aVand that critical direct connection with the heavens.
p271
aVNot bad.
p272
aVThese people not only believed
p273
aVthat the impossible can be done,
p274
aVbut that it must be done.
p275
aa(lp276
VEnough ancient history.
p277
aVWhat are some recent examples of innovations
p278
aVthat combine creative design
p279
aVand technological advances in a way so profound
p280
aVthat they will be remembered
p281
aVa thousand years from now?
p282
aVWell, putting a man on the moon was a good one,
p283
aVand returning him safely to Earth wasn't bad either.
p284
aVTalk about one giant leap:
p285
aVIt's hard to imagine a more profound moment
p286
aVin human history
p287
aVthan when we first left our world
p288
aVto set foot on another.
p289
aa(lp290
VSo what came after the moon?
p291
aVOne is tempted to say that today's pantheon
p292
aVis the Internet,
p293
aVbut I actually think that's quite wrong,
p294
aVor at least it's only part of the story.
p295
aVThe Internet isn't a Pantheon.
p296
aVIt's more like the invention of concrete:
p297
aVimportant, absolutely necessary
p298
aVto build the Pantheon,
p299
aVand enduring,
p300
aVbut entirely insufficient by itself.
p301
aVHowever, just as the technology of concrete
p302
aVwas critical in realization of the Pantheon,
p303
aVnew designers will use the technologies of the Internet
p304
aVto create novel concepts that will endure.
p305
aVThe smartphone is a perfect example.
p306
aVSoon the majority of people on the planet
p307
aVwill have one,
p308
aVand the idea of connecting everyone
p309
aVto both knowledge and each other will endure.
p310
aa(lp311
VSo what's next?
p312
aVWhat imminent advance will be the equivalent of the Pantheon?
p313
aVThinking about this,
p314
aVI rejected many very plausible
p315
aVand dramatic breakthroughs to come,
p316
aVsuch as curing cancer.
p317
aVWhy? Because Pantheons are anchored
p318
aVin designed physical objects,
p319
aVones that inspire by simply seeing
p320
aVand experiencing them,
p321
aVand will continue to do so indefinitely.
p322
aVIt is a different kind of language, like art.
p323
aVThese other vital contributions that extend life
p324
aVand relieve suffering are, of course, critical,
p325
aVand fantastic,
p326
aVbut they're part of the continuum of
p327
aVour overall knowledge and technology,
p328
aVlike the Internet.
p329
aa(lp330
VSo what is next?
p331
aVPerhaps counterintuitively,
p332
aVI'm guessing it's a visionary idea
p333
aVfrom the late 1930s
p334
aVthat's been revived every decade since:
p335
aVautonomous vehicles.
p336
aVNow you're thinking, give me a break.
p337
aVHow can a fancy version of cruise control
p338
aVbe profound?
p339
aVLook, much of our world
p340
aVhas been designed around  roads and transportation.
p341
aVThese were as essential to the success
p342
aVof the Roman Empire
p343
aVas the interstate highway system
p344
aVto the prosperity and development
p345
aVof the United States.
p346
aVToday, these roads that interconnect our world
p347
aVare dominated by cars and trucks
p348
aVthat have remained largely unchanged
p349
aVfor 100 years.
p350
aVAlthough perhaps not obvious today,
p351
aVautonomous vehicles will be the key technology
p352
aVthat enables us to redesign our cities
p353
aVand, by extension, civilization.
p354
aVHere's why:
p355
aVOnce they become ubiquitous,
p356
aVeach year, these vehicles will save
p357
aVtens of thousands of lives in the United States alone
p358
aVand a million globally.
p359
aVAutomotive energy consumption and air pollution
p360
aVwill be cut dramatically.
p361
aVMuch of the road congestion
p362
aVin and out of our cities will disappear.
p363
aVThey will enable compelling new concepts
p364
aVin how we design cities, work,
p365
aVand the way we live.
p366
aVWe will get where we're going faster
p367
aVand society will recapture vast amounts
p368
aVof lost productivity
p369
aVnow spent sitting in traffic basically polluting.
p370
aa(lp371
VBut why now? Why do we think this is ready?
p372
aVBecause over the last 30 years,
p373
aVpeople from outside the automotive industry
p374
aVhave spent countless billions
p375
aVcreating the needed miracles,
p376
aVbut for entirely different purposes.
p377
aVIt took folks like DARPA, universities,
p378
aVand companies completely outside of the automotive industry
p379
aVto notice that if you were clever about it,
p380
aVautonomy could be done now.
p381
aVSo what are the five miracles needed for autonomous vehicles?
p382
aVOne, you need to know
p383
aVwhere you are and exactly what time it is.
p384
aVThis was solved neatly by the GPS system,
p385
aVGlobal Positioning System,
p386
aVthat the U.S. Government put in place.
p387
aVYou need to know where all the roads are,
p388
aVwhat the rules are, and where you're going.
p389
aVThe various needs of personal navigation systems,
p390
aVin-car navigation systems,
p391
aVand web-based maps address this.
p392
aVYou must have near-continuous communication
p393
aVwith high-performance computing networks
p394
aVand with others nearby
p395
aVto understand their intent.
p396
aVThe wireless technologies developed for mobile devices,
p397
aVwith some minor modifications,
p398
aVare completely suitable to solve this.
p399
aVYou'll probably want some restricted roadways
p400
aVto get started
p401
aVthat both society and its lawyers
p402
aVagree are safe to use for this.
p403
aVThis will start with the HOV lanes
p404
aVand move from there.
p405
aVBut finally, you need to recognize
p406
aVpeople, signs and objects.
p407
aVMachine vision, special sensors, and high-performance computing
p408
aVcan do a lot of this,
p409
aVbut it turns out a lot is not good enough
p410
aVwhen your family is on board.
p411
aVOccasionally, humans will  need to do sense-making.
p412
aVFor this, you might actually have to wake up
p413
aVyour passenger and ask them what the hell
p414
aVthat big lump is in the middle of the road.
p415
aVNot so bad, and it will give us a sense of purpose
p416
aVin this new world.
p417
aVBesides, once the first drivers explain
p418
aVto their confused car
p419
aVthat the giant chicken at the fork in the road
p420
aVis actually a restaurant,
p421
aVand it's okay to keep driving,
p422
aVevery other car on the surface of the Earth
p423
aVwill know that from that point on.
p424
aa(lp425
VFive miracles, mostly delivered,
p426
aVand now you just need a clear vision
p427
aVof a better world filled with autonomous vehicles
p428
aVwith seductively beautiful  and new functional designs
p429
aVplus a lot of money and hard work
p430
aVto bring it home.
p431
aVThe beginning is now only a handful of years away,
p432
aVand I predict that autonomous vehicles
p433
aVwill permanently change our world
p434
aVover the next several decades.
p435
aa(lp436
VIn conclusion, I've come to believe
p437
aVthat the ingredients for the next Pantheons
p438
aVare all around us,
p439
aVjust waiting for visionary people
p440
aVwith the broad knowledge,
p441
aVmultidisciplinary skills,
p442
aVand intense passion
p443
aVto harness them to make their dreams a reality.
p444
aVBut these people don't spontaneously
p445
aVpop into existence.
p446
aVThey need to be nurtured and encouraged
p447
aVfrom when they're little kids.
p448
aVWe need to love them and help them
p449
aVdiscover their passions.
p450
aVWe need to encourage them to work hard
p451
aVand help them understand that failure
p452
aVis a necessary ingredient for success,
p453
aVas is perseverance.
p454
aVWe need to help them to find their own role models,
p455
aVand give them the confidence to believe in themselves
p456
aVand to believe that anything is possible,
p457
aVand just as my grandpa did when he took me shopping for surplus,
p458
aVand just as my parents did
p459
aVwhen they took me to science museums,
p460
aVwe need to encourage them to find their own path,
p461
aVeven if it's very different from our own.
p462
aa(lp463
VBut a cautionary note:
p464
aVWe also need to periodically pry them away
p465
aVfrom their modern miracles,
p466
aVthe computers, phones, tablets,
p467
aVgame machines and TVs,
p468
aVtake them out into the sunlight
p469
aVso they can experience both the natural
p470
aVand design wonders of our world,
p471
aVour planet and our civilization.
p472
aVIf we don't, they won't understand
p473
aVwhat these precious things are
p474
aVthat someday they will be resopnsible
p475
aVfor protecting and improving.
p476
aVWe also need them to understand
p477
aVsomething that doesn't seem adequately appreciated
p478
aVin our increasingly tech-dependent world,
p479
aVthat art and design
p480
aVare not luxuries,
p481
aVnor somehow incompatible
p482
aVwith science and engineering.
p483
aVThey are in fact essential to what makes us special.
p484
aa(lp485
VSomeday, if you get the chance,
p486
aVperhaps you can take your kids
p487
aVto the actual Pantheon,
p488
aVas we will our daughter Kira,
p489
aVto experience firsthand
