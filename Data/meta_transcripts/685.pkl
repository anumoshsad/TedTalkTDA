VWe grew up
p4
aVinteracting with the physical objects around us.
p5
aVThere are an enormous number of them that we use every day.
p6
aVUnlike most of our computing devices,
p7
aVthese objects are much more fun to use.
p8
aVWhen you talk about objects,
p9
aVone other thing automatically comes attached to that thing,
p10
aVand that is gestures:
p11
aVhow we manipulate these objects,
p12
aVhow we use these objects in everyday life.
p13
aVWe use gestures not only to interact with these objects,
p14
aVbut we also use them to interact with each other.
p15
aVA gesture of "Namaste!", maybe, to respect someone, or maybe,
p16
aVin India I don't need to teach a kid that this means
p17
aV"four runs" in cricket.
p18
aVIt comes as a part of our everyday learning.
p19
aa(lp20
VSo, I am very interested, from the beginning,
p21
aVhow our knowledge about everyday objects and gestures,
p22
aVand how we use these objects,
p23
aVcan be leveraged to our interactions with the digital world.
p24
aVRather than using a keyboard and mouse,
p25
aVwhy can I not use my computer
p26
aVin the same way that I interact in the physical world?
p27
aa(lp28
VSo, I started this exploration around eight years back,
p29
aVand it literally started with a mouse on my desk.
p30
aVRather than using it for my computer, I actually opened it.
p31
aVMost of you might be aware that, in those days,
p32
aVthe mouse used to come with a ball inside,
p33
aVand there were two rollers
p34
aVthat actually guide the computer where the ball is moving,
p35
aVand, accordingly, where the mouse is moving.
p36
aVSo, I was interested in these two rollers,
p37
aVand I actually wanted more, so I borrowed another mouse from a friend \u2014
p38
aVnever returned to him \u2014
p39
aVand I now had four rollers.
p40
aVInterestingly, what I did with these rollers is,
p41
aVbasically, I took them off of these mouses and then put them in one line.
p42
aVIt had some strings and pulleys and some springs.
p43
aVWhat I got is basically a gesture-interface device
p44
aVthat actually acts as a motion-sensing device
p45
aVmade for two dollars.
p46
aVSo, here, whatever movement I do in my physical world
p47
aVis actually replicated inside the digital world
p48
aVjust using this small device that I made, around eight years back,
p49
aVin 2000.
p50
aa(lp51
VBecause I was interested in integrating these two worlds,
p52
aVI thought of sticky notes.
p53
aVI thought, "Why can I not connect
p54
aVthe normal interface of a physical sticky note
p55
aVto the digital world?"
p56
aVA message written on a sticky note to my mom,
p57
aVon paper,
p58
aVcan come to an SMS,
p59
aVor maybe a meeting reminder
p60
aVautomatically syncs with my digital calendar \u2014
p61
aVa to-do list that automatically syncs with you.
p62
aVBut you can also search in the digital world,
p63
aVor maybe you can write a query, saying,
p64
aV"What is Dr. Smith's address?"
p65
aVand this small system actually prints it out \u2014
p66
aVso it actually acts like a paper input-output system,
p67
aVjust made out of paper.
p68
aa(lp69
VIn another exploration,
p70
aVI thought of making a pen that can draw in three dimensions.
p71
aVSo, I implemented this pen that can help designers and architects
p72
aVnot only think in three dimensions,
p73
aVbut they can actually draw,
p74
aVso that it's more intuitive to use that way.
p75
aa(lp76
VThen I thought, "Why not make a Google Map,
p77
aVbut in the physical world?"
p78
aVRather than typing a keyword to find something,
p79
aVI put my objects on top of it.
p80
aVIf I put a boarding pass, it will show me where the flight gate is.
p81
aVA coffee cup will show where you can find more coffee,
p82
aVor where you can trash the cup.
p83
aa(lp84
VSo, these were some of the earlier explorations I did
p85
aVbecause the goal was to connect these two worlds seamlessly.
p86
aVAmong all these experiments,
p87
aVthere was one thing in common:
p88
aVI was trying to bring a part of the physical world
p89
aVto the digital world.
p90
aVI was taking some part of the objects,
p91
aVor any of the intuitiveness of real life,
p92
aVand bringing them to the digital world,
p93
aVbecause the goal was to make our computing interfaces more intuitive.
p94
aa(lp95
VBut then I realized that we humans are not actually interested in computing.
p96
aVWhat we are interested in is information.
p97
aVWe want to know about things.
p98
aVWe want to know about dynamic things going around.
p99
aa(lp100
VSo I thought, around last year \u2014 in the beginning of the last year \u2014
p101
aVI started thinking, "Why can I not take this approach in the reverse way?"
p102
aVMaybe, "How about I take my digital world
p103
aVand paint the physical world with that digital information?"
p104
aVBecause pixels are actually, right now, confined in these rectangular devices
p105
aVthat fit in our pockets.
p106
aVWhy can I not remove this confine
p107
aVand take that to my everyday objects, everyday life
p108
aVso that I don't need to learn the new language
p109
aVfor interacting with those pixels?
p110
aa(lp111
VSo, in order to realize this dream,
p112
aVI actually thought of putting a big-size projector on my head.
p113
aVI think that's why this is called a head-mounted projector, isn't it?
p114
aVI took it very literally,
p115
aVand took my bike helmet,
p116
aVput a little cut over there so that the projector actually fits nicely.
p117
aVSo now, what I can do \u2014
p118
aVI can augment the world around me with this digital information.
p119
aa(lp120
VBut later,
p121
aVI realized that I actually wanted to interact
p122
aVwith those digital pixels, also.
p123
aVSo I put a small camera over there that acts as a digital eye.
p124
aVLater, we moved to a much better,
p125
aVconsumer-oriented pendant version of that,
p126
aVthat many of you now know as the SixthSense device.
p127
aa(lp128
VBut the most interesting thing about this particular technology
p129
aVis that you can carry your digital world with you
p130
aVwherever you go.
p131
aVYou can start using any surface, any wall around you,
p132
aVas an interface.
p133
aVThe camera is actually tracking all your gestures.
p134
aVWhatever you're doing with your hands,
p135
aVit's understanding that gesture.
p136
aVAnd, actually, if you see, there are some color markers
p137
aVthat in the beginning version we are using with it.
p138
aVYou can start painting on any wall.
p139
aVYou stop by a wall, and start painting on that wall.
p140
aVBut we are not only tracking one finger, here.
p141
aVWe are giving you the freedom of using all of both of your hands,
p142
aVso you can actually use both of your hands to zoom into or zoom out
p143
aVof a map just by pinching all present.
p144
aVThe camera is actually doing \u2014 just, getting all the images \u2014
p145
aVis doing the edge recognition and also the color recognition
p146
aVand so many other small algorithms are going on inside.
p147
aVSo, technically, it's a little bit complex,
p148
aVbut it gives you an output which is more intuitive to use, in some sense.
p149
aa(lp150
VBut I'm more excited that you can actually take it outside.
p151
aVRather than getting your camera out of your pocket,
p152
aVyou can just do the gesture of taking a photo,
p153
aVand it takes a photo for you.
p154
aa(lp155
V(Applause)
p156
aa(lp157
VThank you.
p158
aVAnd later I can find a wall, anywhere,
p159
aVand start browsing those photos
p160
aVor maybe, "OK, I want to modify this photo a little bit
p161
aVand send it as an email to a friend."
p162
aVSo, we are looking for an era
p163
aVwhere computing will actually merge with the physical world.
p164
aVAnd, of course, if you don't have any surface,
p165
aVyou can start using your palm for simple operations.
p166
aVHere, I'm dialing a phone number just using my hand.
p167
aVThe camera is actually not only understanding your hand movements,
p168
aVbut, interestingly,
p169
aVis also able to understand what objects you are holding in your hand.
p170
aa(lp171
VFor example, in this case,
p172
aVthe book cover is matched
p173
aVwith so many thousands, or maybe millions of books online,
p174
aVand checking out which book it is.
p175
aVOnce it has that information,
p176
aVit finds out more reviews about that,
p177
aVor maybe New York Times has a sound overview on that,
p178
aVso you can actually hear, on a physical book,
p179
aVa review as sound.
p180
aa(lp181
V(Video) Famous talk at Harvard University \u2014
p182
aa(lp183
VThis was Obama's visit last week to MIT.
p184
aa(lp185
V(Video) And particularly I want to thank two outstanding MIT \u2014
p186
aa(lp187
VPranav Mistry: So, I was seeing the live [video] of his talk,
p188
aVoutside, on just a newspaper.
p189
aVYour newspaper will show you live weather information
p190
aVrather than having it updated.
p191
aVYou have to check your computer in order to do that, right?
p192
aa(lp193
V(Applause)
p194
aa(lp195
VWhen I'm going back, I can just use my boarding pass
p196
aVto check how much my flight has been delayed,
p197
aVbecause at that particular time,
p198
aVI'm not feeling like opening my iPhone,
p199
aVand checking out a particular icon.
p200
aVAnd I think this technology will not only change the way \u2014
p201
aa(lp202
V(Laughter)
p203
aa(lp204
VYes.
p205
aVIt will change the way we interact with people, also,
p206
aVnot only the physical world.
p207
aVThe fun part is, I'm going to the Boston metro,
p208
aVand playing a pong game inside the train on the ground, right?
p209
aa(lp210
V(Laughter)
p211
aa(lp212
VAnd I think the imagination is the only limit
p213
aVof what you can think of
p214
aVwhen this kind of technology merges with real life.
p215
aa(lp216
VBut many of you argue, actually,
p217
aVthat all of our work is not only about physical objects.
p218
aVWe actually do lots of accounting and paper editing
p219
aVand all those kinds of things; what about that?
p220
aVAnd many of you are excited about the next-generation tablet computers
p221
aVto come out in the market.
p222
aa(lp223
VSo, rather than waiting for that,
p224
aVI actually made my own, just using a piece of paper.
p225
aVSo, what I did here is remove the camera \u2014
p226
aVAll the webcam cameras have a microphone inside the camera.
p227
aVI removed the microphone from that,
p228
aVand then just pinched that \u2014
p229
aVlike I just made a clip out of the microphone \u2014
p230
aVand clipped that to a piece of paper, any paper that you found around.
p231
aVSo now the sound of the touch
p232
aVis getting me when exactly I'm touching the paper.
p233
aVBut the camera is actually tracking where my fingers are moving.
p234
aa(lp235
VYou can of course watch movies.
p236
aa(lp237
V(Video) Good afternoon. My name is Russell,
p238
aVand I am a Wilderness Explorer in Tribe 54."
p239
aa(lp240
VPM: And you can of course play games.
p241
aa(lp242
V(Car engine)
p243
aa(lp244
VHere, the camera is actually understanding how you're holding the paper
p245
aVand playing a car-racing game.
p246
aa(lp247
V(Applause)
p248
aa(lp249
VMany of you already must have thought, OK, you can browse.
p250
aVYeah. Of course you can browse to any websites
p251
aVor you can do all sorts of computing on a piece of paper
p252
aVwherever you need it.
p253
aVSo, more interestingly,
p254
aVI'm interested in how we can take that in a more dynamic way.
p255
aVWhen I come back to my desk, I can just pinch that information
p256
aVback to my desktop
p257
aVso I can use my full-size computer.
p258
aa(lp259
V(Applause)
p260
aa(lp261
VAnd why only computers? We can just play with papers.
p262
aVPaper world is interesting to play with.
p263
aVHere, I'm taking a part of a document,
p264
aVand putting over here a second part from a second place,
p265
aVand I'm actually modifying the information that I have over there.
p266
aVYeah. And I say, "OK, this looks nice, let me print it out, that thing."
p267
aVSo I now have a print-out of that thing.
p268
aVSo the workflow is more intuitive,
p269
aVthe way we used to do it maybe 20 years back,
p270
aVrather than now switching between these two worlds.
p271
aa(lp272
VSo, as a last thought,
p273
aVI think that integrating information to everyday objects
p274
aVwill not only help us to get rid of the digital divide,
p275
aVthe gap between these two worlds,
p276
aVbut will also help us, in some way,
p277
aVto stay human,
p278
aVto be more connected to our physical world.
p279
aVAnd it will actually help us not end up being machines
p280
aVsitting in front of other machines.
p281
aa(lp282
VThat's all. Thank you.
p283
aa(lp284
V(Applause)
p285
aa(lp286
VThank you.
p287
aa(lp288
V(Applause)
p289
aa(lp290
VChris Anderson: So, Pranav, first of all, you're a genius.
p291
aVThis is incredible, really.
p292
aVWhat are you doing with this? Is there a company being planned?
p293
aVOr is this research forever, or what?
p294
aa(lp295
VPranav Mistry: So, there are lots of companies,
p296
aVsponsor companies of Media Lab interested in taking this ahead
p297
aVin one or another way.
p298
aVCompanies like mobile-phone operators
p299
aVwant to take this in a different way than the NGOs in India,
p300
aVthinking, "Why can we only have 'Sixth Sense'?
p301
aVWe should have a 'Fifth Sense' for missing-sense people who cannot speak.
p302
aVThis technology can be used for them to speak out in a different way
p303
aVmaybe a speaker system."
p304
aa(lp305
VCA: What are your own plans? Are you staying at MIT,
p306
aVor are you going to do something with this?
p307
aa(lp308
VPM: I'm trying to make this more available to people
p309
aVso that anyone can develop their own SixthSense device,
p310
aVbecause the hardware is actually not that hard to manufacture
p311
aVor hard to make your own.
p312
aVWe will provide all the open source software for them,
p313
aVmaybe starting next month.
p314
aa(lp315
VCA: Open source? Wow.
p316
aa(lp317
V(Applause)
p318
aa(lp319
VCA: Are you going to come back to India with some of this, at some point?
p320
aa(lp321
VPM: Yeah. Yes, yes, of course.
p322
aa(lp323
VCA: What are your plans? MIT? India?
p324
aVHow are you going to split your time going forward?
p325
aa(lp326
VPM: There is a lot of energy here. Lots of learning.
p327
aVAll of this work that you have seen is all about my learning in India.
p328
aVAnd now, if you see, it's more about the cost-effectiveness:
p329
aVthis system costs you $300
p330
aVcompared to the $20,000 surface tables, or anything like that.
p331
aVOr maybe even the $2 mouse gesture system at that time was costing around $5,000?
p332
aVI showed that, at a conference, to President Abdul Kalam, at that time,
p333
aVand then he said, "OK, we should use this in Bhabha Atomic Research Centre
p334
aVfor some use of that."
p335
aVSo I'm excited about how I can bring the technology to the masses
p336
aVrather than just keeping that technology in the lab environment.
p337
aa(lp338
V(Applause)
p339
aa(lp340
VCA: Based on the people we've seen at TED,
p341
aVI would say you're truly one of the two or three
p342
aVbest inventors in the world right now.
p343
aVIt's an honor to have you at TED.
p344
aVThank you so much.
p345
aVThat's fantastic.
