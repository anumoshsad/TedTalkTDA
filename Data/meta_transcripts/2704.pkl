VWhen I was a kid, I was obsessed with the Guinness Book of World Records,
p4
aVand I really wanted to set a world record myself.
p5
aVBut there was just one small problem:
p6
aVI had absolutely no talent.
p7
aVSo I decided to set a world record in something
p8
aVthat demanded absolutely no skill at all.
p9
aVI decided to set a world record
p10
aVin crawling.
p11
aa(lp12
V(Laughter)
p13
aa(lp14
VNow, the record at the time was 12 and a half miles,
p15
aVand for some reason, this seemed totally manageable.
p16
aa(lp17
V(Laughter)
p18
aa(lp19
VI recruited my friend Anne,
p20
aVand together we decided, we didn't even need to train.
p21
aa(lp22
V(Laughter)
p23
aa(lp24
VAnd on the day of our record attempt,
p25
aVwe put furniture pads on the outside of our good luck jeans
p26
aVand we set off,
p27
aVand right away, we were in trouble,
p28
aVbecause the denim was against our skin
p29
aVand it began to chafe,
p30
aVand soon our knees were being chewed up.
p31
aVHours in,
p32
aVit began to rain.
p33
aVThen, Anne dropped out.
p34
aVThen, it got dark.
p35
aVNow, by now, my knees were bleeding through my jeans,
p36
aVand I was hallucinating from the cold
p37
aVand the pain and the monotony.
p38
aVAnd to give you an idea of the suffer-fest that I was undergoing,
p39
aVthe first lap around the high school track took 10 minutes.
p40
aVThe last lap took almost 30.
p41
aa(lp42
VAfter 12 hours of crawling,
p43
aVI stopped,
p44
aVand I had gone eight and a half miles.
p45
aVSo I was short of the 12-and-a-half-mile record.
p46
aa(lp47
VNow, for many years, I thought this was a story of abject failure,
p48
aVbut today I see it differently,
p49
aVbecause when I was attempting the world record,
p50
aVI was doing three things.
p51
aVI was getting outside my comfort zone,
p52
aVI was calling upon my resilience,
p53
aVand I was finding confidence in myself
p54
aVand my own decisions.
p55
aVI didn't know it then,
p56
aVbut those are not the attributes of failure.
p57
aVThose are the attributes of bravery.
p58
aa(lp59
VNow, in 1989, at the age of 26,
p60
aVI became a San Francisco firefighter,
p61
aVand I was the 15th woman in a department of 1,500 men.
p62
aa(lp63
V(Applause)
p64
aa(lp65
VAnd as you can imagine, when I arrived
p66
aVthere were many doubts about whether we could do the job.
p67
aVSo even though I was a 5'10", 150-pound collegiate rower,
p68
aVand someone who could endure 12 hours of searing knee pain \u2014
p69
aa(lp70
V(Laughter)
p71
aa(lp72
VI knew I still had to prove my strength and fitness.
p73
aa(lp74
VSo one day a call came in for a fire,
p75
aVand sure enough, when my engine group pulled up,
p76
aVthere was black smoke billowing from a building off an alleyway.
p77
aVAnd I was with a big guy named Skip,
p78
aVand he was on the nozzle, and I was right behind,
p79
aVand it was a typical sort of fire.
p80
aVIt was smoky, it was hot,
p81
aVand all of a sudden,
p82
aVthere was an explosion,
p83
aVand Skip and I were blown backwards,
p84
aVmy mask was knocked sideways,
p85
aVand there was this moment of confusion.
p86
aVAnd then I picked myself up,
p87
aVI groped for the nozzle,
p88
aVand I did what a firefighter was supposed to do:
p89
aVI lunged forward,
p90
aVopened up the water
p91
aVand I tackled the fire myself.
p92
aVThe explosion had been caused by a water heater,
p93
aVso nobody was hurt, and ultimately it was not a big deal,
p94
aVbut later Skip came up to me and said,
p95
aV"Nice job, Caroline,"
p96
aVin this surprised sort of voice.
p97
aa(lp98
V(Laughter)
p99
aa(lp100
VAnd I was confused, because the fire hadn't been difficult physically,
p101
aVso why was he looking at me with something like astonishment?
p102
aVAnd then it became clear:
p103
aVSkip, who was by the way a really nice guy
p104
aVand an excellent firefighter,
p105
aVnot only thought that women could not be strong,
p106
aVhe thought that they could not be brave either.
p107
aVAnd he wasn't the only one.
p108
aVFriends, acquaintances and strangers,
p109
aVmen and women throughout my career
p110
aVask me over and over,
p111
aV"Caroline, all that fire, all that danger,
p112
aVaren't you scared?"
p113
aVHonestly, I never heard a male firefighter asked this.
p114
aVAnd I became curious.
p115
aVWhy wasn't bravery expected of women?
p116
aa(lp117
VNow, the answer began to come
p118
aVwhen a friend of mine lamented to me
p119
aVthat her young daughter was a big scaredy-cat,
p120
aVand so I began to notice,
p121
aVand yes, the daughter was anxious,
p122
aVbut more than that, the parents were anxious.
p123
aVMost of what they said to her when she was outside began with,
p124
aV"Be careful," "Watch out," or "No."
p125
aVNow, my friends were not bad parents.
p126
aVThey were just doing what most parents do,
p127
aVwhich is cautioning their daughters much more than they caution their sons.
p128
aa(lp129
VThere was a study involving a playground fire pole, ironically,
p130
aVin which researchers saw that little girls were very likely to be warned
p131
aVby both their moms and dads about the fire pole's risk,
p132
aVand if the little girls still wanted to play on the fire pole,
p133
aVa parent was very likely to assist her.
p134
aVBut the little boys?
p135
aVThey were encouraged to play on the fire pole
p136
aVdespite any trepidations that they might have,
p137
aVand often the parents offered guidance on how to use it on their own.
p138
aVSo what message does this send to both boys and girls?
p139
aVWell, that girls are fragile and more in need of help,
p140
aVand that boys can and should master difficult tasks by themselves.
p141
aVIt says that girls should be fearful
p142
aVand boys should be gutsy.
p143
aa(lp144
VNow, the irony is that at this young age,
p145
aVgirls and boys are actually very alike physically.
p146
aVIn fact, girls are often stronger until puberty,
p147
aVand more mature.
p148
aVAnd yet we adults act
p149
aVas if girls are more fragile
p150
aVand more in need of help,
p151
aVand they can't handle as much.
p152
aVThis is the message that we absorb as kids,
p153
aVand this is the message that fully permeates as we grow up.
p154
aVWe women believe it, men believe it,
p155
aVand guess what?
p156
aVAs we become parents, we pass it on to our children,
p157
aVand so it goes.
p158
aa(lp159
VWell, so now I had my answer.
p160
aVThis is why women, even firewomen,
p161
aVwere expected to be scared.
p162
aVThis is why women often are scared.
p163
aa(lp164
VNow, I know some of you won't believe me when I tell you this,
p165
aVbut I am not against fear.
p166
aVI know it's an important emotion, and it's there to keep us safe.
p167
aVBut the problem is when fear is the primary reaction
p168
aVthat we teach and encourage in girls
p169
aVwhenever they face something outside their comfort zone.
p170
aa(lp171
VSo I was a paraglider pilot for many years \u2014
p172
aa(lp173
V(Applause)
p174
aa(lp175
Vand a paraglider is a parachute-like wing,
p176
aVand it does fly very well,
p177
aVbut to many people I realize it looks just like a bedsheet
p178
aVwith strings attached.
p179
aa(lp180
V(Laughter)
p181
aa(lp182
VAnd I spent a lot of time on mountaintops
p183
aVinflating this bedsheet,
p184
aVrunning off and flying.
p185
aVAnd I know what you're thinking.
p186
aVYou're like, Caroline, a little fear would make sense here.
p187
aVAnd you're right, it does.
p188
aVI assure you, I did feel fear.
p189
aVBut on that mountaintop,
p190
aVwaiting for the wind to come in just right,
p191
aVI felt so many other things, too:
p192
aVexhilaration, confidence.
p193
aVI knew I was a good pilot.
p194
aVI knew the conditions were good, or I wouldn't be there.
p195
aVI knew how great it was going to be a thousand feet in the air.
p196
aVSo yes, fear was there,
p197
aVbut I would take a good hard look at it,
p198
aVassess just how relevant it was
p199
aVand then put it where it belonged,
p200
aVwhich was more often than not
p201
aVbehind my exhilaration, my anticipation
p202
aVand my confidence.
p203
aVSo I'm not against fear.
p204
aVI'm just pro-bravery.
p205
aa(lp206
VNow, I'm not saying your girls must be firefighters
p207
aVor that they should be paragliders,
p208
aVbut I am saying that we are raising our girls to be timid, even helpless,
p209
aVand it begins when we caution them against physical risk.
p210
aVThe fear we learn and the experiences we don't
p211
aVstay with us as we become women
p212
aVand morphs into all those things that we face and try to shed:
p213
aVour hesitation in speaking out,
p214
aVour deference so that we can be liked
p215
aVand our lack of confidence in our own decisions.
p216
aa(lp217
VSo how do we become brave?
p218
aVWell, here's the good news.
p219
aVBravery is learned,
p220
aVand like anything learned,
p221
aVit just needs to be practiced.
p222
aVSo first,
p223
aVwe have to take a deep breath
p224
aVand encourage our girls
p225
aVto skateboard, climb trees
p226
aVand clamber around on that playground fire pole.
p227
aVThis is what my own mother did.
p228
aVShe didn't know it then,
p229
aVbut researchers have a name for this.
p230
aVThey call it risky play,
p231
aVand studies show that risky play is really important for kids, all kids,
p232
aVbecause it teaches hazard assessment,
p233
aVit teaches delayed gratification,
p234
aVit teaches resilience,
p235
aVit teaches confidence.
p236
aVIn other words,
p237
aVwhen kids get outside and practice bravery,
p238
aVthey learn valuable life lessons.
p239
aa(lp240
VSecond, we have to stop cautioning our girls willy-nilly.
p241
aVSo notice next time you say,
p242
aV"Watch out, you're going to get hurt,"
p243
aVor, "Don't do that, it's dangerous."
p244
aVAnd remember that often what you're really telling her
p245
aVis that she shouldn't be pushing herself,
p246
aVthat she's really not good enough,
p247
aVthat she should be afraid.
p248
aa(lp249
VThird,
p250
aVwe women have to start practicing bravery, too.
p251
aVWe cannot teach our girls until we teach ourselves.
p252
aVSo here's another thing:
p253
aVfear and exhilaration
p254
aVfeel very similar \u2014
p255
aVthe shaky hands, the heightened heart rate,
p256
aVthe nervous tension,
p257
aVand I'm betting that for many of you
p258
aVthe last time you thought you were scared out of your wits,
p259
aVyou may have been feeling mostly exhilaration,
p260
aVand now you've missed an opportunity.
p261
aVSo practice.
p262
aVAnd while girls should be getting outside to learn to be gutsy,
p263
aVI get that adults don't want to get on hoverboards or climb trees,
p264
aVso we all should be practicing
p265
aVat home, in the office
p266
aVand even right here getting up the guts
p267
aVto talk to someone that you really admire.
p268
aa(lp269
VFinally, when your girl is, let's say,
p270
aVon her bike on the top of the steep hill
p271
aVthat she insists she's too scared to go down,
p272
aVguide her to access her bravery.
p273
aVUltimately, maybe that hill really is too steep,
p274
aVbut she'll come to that conclusion through courage, not fear.
p275
aVBecause this is not about the steep hill in front of her.
p276
aVThis is about the life ahead of her
p277
aVand that she has the tools
p278
aVto handle and assess
p279
aVall the dangers that we cannot protect her from,
p280
aVall the challenges that we won't be there to guide her through,
p281
aVeverything that our girls here
p282
aVand around the world
p283
aVface in their future.
p284
aa(lp285
VSo by the way,
p286
aVthe world record for crawling today \u2014
p287
aa(lp288
V(Laughter)
p289
aa(lp290
Vis 35.18 miles,
p291
aVand I would really love to see a girl go break that.
