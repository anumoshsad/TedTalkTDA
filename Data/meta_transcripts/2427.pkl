VSo I come from the tallest people on the planet \u2014
p4
aVthe Dutch.
p5
aVIt hasn't always been this way.
p6
aVIn fact, all across the globe, people have been gaining height.
p7
aVIn the last 150 years,
p8
aVin developed countries,
p9
aVon average, we have gotten 10 centimeters taller.
p10
aVAnd scientists have a lot of theories about why this is,
p11
aVbut almost all of them involve nutrition,
p12
aVnamely the increase of dairy and meat.
p13
aa(lp14
VIn the last 50 years,
p15
aVglobal meat consumption has more than quadrupled,
p16
aVfrom 71 million tons to 310 million tons.
p17
aVSomething similar has been going on with milk and eggs.
p18
aVIn every society where incomes have risen, so has protein consumption.
p19
aVAnd we know that globally, we are getting richer.
p20
aVAnd as the middle class is on the rise, so is our global population,
p21
aVfrom 7 billion of us today to 9.7 billion by 2050,
p22
aVwhich means that by 2050,
p23
aVwe are going to need at least 70 percent more protein
p24
aVthan what is available to humankind today.
p25
aVAnd the latest prediction of the UN puts that population number,
p26
aVby the end of this century, at 11 billion,
p27
aVwhich means that we are going to need a lot more protein.
p28
aa(lp29
VThis challenge is staggering \u2014
p30
aVso much so, that recently,
p31
aVa team at Anglia Ruskin Global Sustainability Institute suggested
p32
aVthat if we don't change our global policies
p33
aVand food production systems,
p34
aVour societies might actually collapse in the next 30 years.
p35
aa(lp36
VCurrently, our ocean serves as the main source of animal protein.
p37
aVOver 2.6 billion people depend on it every single day.
p38
aVAt the same time,
p39
aVour global fisheries are two-and-a-half times larger
p40
aVthan what our oceans can sustainably support,
p41
aVmeaning that humans take far more fish from the ocean
p42
aVthan the oceans can naturally replace.
p43
aa(lp44
VWWF recently published a report showing that just in the last 40 years,
p45
aVour global marine life has been slashed in half.
p46
aVAnd another recent report suggests that of our largest predatory species,
p47
aVsuch as swordfish and bluefin tuna,
p48
aVover 90 percent has disappeared since the 1950s.
p49
aa(lp50
VAnd there are a lot of great, sustainable fishing initiatives across the planet
p51
aVworking towards better practices and better-managed fisheries.
p52
aVBut ultimately,
p53
aVall of these initiatives are working towards keeping current catch constant.
p54
aVIt's unlikely,
p55
aVeven with the best-managed fisheries,
p56
aVthat we are going to be able to take much more from the ocean
p57
aVthan we do today.
p58
aa(lp59
VWe have to stop plundering our oceans the way we have.
p60
aVWe need to alleviate the pressure on it.
p61
aVAnd we are at a point
p62
aVwhere if we push much harder for more produce,
p63
aVwe might face total collapse.
p64
aVOur current systems are not going to feed a growing global population.
p65
aa(lp66
VSo how do we fix this?
p67
aVWhat's the world going to look like in just 35 short years
p68
aVwhen there's 2.7 billion more of us sharing the same resources?
p69
aVWe could all become vegan.
p70
aVSounds like a great idea,
p71
aVbut it's not realistic
p72
aVand it's impossibly hard to mandate globally.
p73
aa(lp74
VPeople are eating animal protein whether we like it or not.
p75
aVAnd suppose we fail to change our ways
p76
aVand continue on the current path,
p77
aVfailing to meet demands.
p78
aa(lp79
VThe World Health Organization recently reported
p80
aVthat 800 million people are suffering from malnutrition and food shortage,
p81
aVwhich is due to that same growing, global population
p82
aVand the declining access to resources like water, energy and land.
p83
aVIt takes very little imagination
p84
aVto picture a world of global unrest, riots and further malnutrition.
p85
aVPeople are hungry,
p86
aVand we are running dangerously low on natural resources.
p87
aVFor so, so many reasons,
p88
aVwe need to change our global food production systems.
p89
aa(lp90
VWe must do better
p91
aVand there is a solution.
p92
aVAnd that solution lies in aquaculture \u2014
p93
aVthe farming of fish, plants like seaweed, shellfish and crustaceans.
p94
aVAs the great ocean hero Jacques Cousteau once said,
p95
aV"We must start using the ocean as farmers instead of hunters.
p96
aVThat's what civilization is all about \u2014 farming instead of hunting."
p97
aVFish is the last food that we hunt.
p98
aa(lp99
VAnd why is it that we keep hearing phrases like,
p100
aV"Life's too short for farmed fish,"
p101
aVor, "Wild-caught, of course!"
p102
aVover fish that we know virtually nothing about?
p103
aVWe don't know what it ate during its lifetime,
p104
aVand we don't know what pollution it encounters.
p105
aVAnd if it was a large predatory species,
p106
aVit might have gone through the coast of Fukushima yesterday.
p107
aVWe don't know.
p108
aVVery few people realize
p109
aVthe traceability in fisheries never goes beyond the hunter
p110
aVthat caught the wild animal.
p111
aa(lp112
VBut let's back up for a second
p113
aVand talk about why fish is the best food choice.
p114
aVIt's healthy,
p115
aVit prevents heart disease,
p116
aVit provides key amino acids
p117
aVand key fatty acids like Omega-3s,
p118
aVwhich is very different from almost any other type of meat.
p119
aVAnd aside from being healthy,
p120
aVit's also a lot more exciting and diverse.
p121
aa(lp122
VThink about it \u2014 most animal farming is pretty monotonous.
p123
aVCow is cow, sheep is sheep, pig's pig,
p124
aVand poultry \u2014 turkey, duck, chicken \u2014 pretty much sums it up.
p125
aVAnd then there's 500 species of fish being farmed currently.
p126
aVnot that Western supermarkets reflect that on their shelves,
p127
aVbut that's beside that point.
p128
aa(lp129
VAnd you can farm fish in a very healthy manner
p130
aVthat's good for us, good for the planet and good for the fish.
p131
aVI know I sound fish-obsessed \u2014
p132
aa(lp133
V(Laughter)
p134
aa(lp135
VLet me explain:
p136
aVMy brilliant partner and wife, Amy Novograntz, and I got involved
p137
aVin aquaculture a couple of years ago.
p138
aVWe were inspired by Sylvia Earle,
p139
aVwho won the TED Prize in 2009.
p140
aVWe actually met on Mission Blue I in the Galapagos.
p141
aVAmy was there as the TED Prize Director;
p142
aVme, an entrepreneur from the Netherlands and concerned citizen,
p143
aVlove to dive, passion for the oceans.
p144
aa(lp145
VMission Blue truly changed our lives.
p146
aVWe fell in love,
p147
aVgot married
p148
aVand we came away really inspired,
p149
aVthinking we really want to do something about ocean conservation \u2014
p150
aVsomething that was meant to last,
p151
aVthat could make a real difference
p152
aVand something that we could do together.
p153
aa(lp154
VLittle did we expect that that would lead us to fish farming.
p155
aVBut a few months after we got off the boat,
p156
aVwe got to a meeting at Conservation International,
p157
aVwhere the Director General of WorldFish was talking about aquaculture,
p158
aVasking a room full of environmentalists to stop turning from it,
p159
aVrealize what was going on
p160
aVand to really get involved
p161
aVbecause aquaculture has the potential
p162
aVto be just what our oceans and populations need.
p163
aa(lp164
VWe were stunned when we heard the stats
p165
aVthat we didn't know more about this industry already
p166
aVand excited about the chance to help get it right.
p167
aa(lp168
VAnd to talk about stats \u2014
p169
aVright now, the amount of fish consumed globally,
p170
aVwild catch and farmed combined,
p171
aVis twice the tonnage of the total amount of beef
p172
aVproduced on planet earth last year.
p173
aVEvery single fishing vessel combined,
p174
aVsmall and large, across the globe,
p175
aVtogether produce about 65 million tons of wild-caught seafood
p176
aVfor human consumption.
p177
aa(lp178
VAquaculture this year,
p179
aVfor the first time in history,
p180
aVactually produces more than what we catch from the wild.
p181
aa(lp182
VBut now this:
p183
aVDemand is going to go up.
p184
aVIn the next 35 years,
p185
aVwe are going to need an additional 85 million tons to meet demand,
p186
aVwhich is one-and-a-half times as much, almost,
p187
aVas what we catch globally out of our oceans.
p188
aVAn enormous number.
p189
aa(lp190
VIt's safe to assume that that's not going to come from the ocean.
p191
aVIt needs to come from farming.
p192
aVAnd talk about farming \u2014
p193
aVfor farming you need resources.
p194
aVAs a human needs to eat to grow and stay alive,
p195
aVso does an animal.
p196
aVA cow needs to eat eight to nine pounds of feed
p197
aVand drink almost 8,000 liters of water
p198
aVto create just one pound of meat.
p199
aVExperts agree that it's impossible
p200
aVto farm cows for every inhabitant on this planet.
p201
aVWe just don't have enough feed or water.
p202
aa(lp203
VAnd we can't keep cutting down rain forests for it.
p204
aVAnd fresh water \u2014 planet earth has a very limited supply.
p205
aVWe need something more efficient
p206
aVto keep humankind alive on this planet.
p207
aa(lp208
VAnd now let's compare that with fish farming.
p209
aVYou can farm one pound of fish with just one pound of feed,
p210
aVand depending on species, even less.
p211
aVAnd why is that?
p212
aVWell, that's because fish, first of all, float.
p213
aVThey don't need to stand around all day resisting gravity like we do.
p214
aVAnd most fish are cold-blooded \u2014
p215
aVthey don't need to heat themselves.
p216
aVFish chills.
p217
aa(lp218
V(Laughter)
p219
aa(lp220
VAnd it needs very little water,
p221
aVwhich is counterintuitive,
p222
aVbut as we say,
p223
aVit swims in it but it hardly drinks it.
p224
aVFish are the most resource-efficient animal protein available to humankind,
p225
aVaside from insects.
p226
aa(lp227
VHow much we've learned since.
p228
aVFor example, on top of that 65 million tons that's annually caught
p229
aVfor human consumption,
p230
aVthere's an additional 30 million tons caught for animal feed,
p231
aVmostly sardines and anchovies for the aquaculture industry
p232
aVthat's turned into fish meal and fish oil.
p233
aa(lp234
VThis is madness.
p235
aVSixty-five percent of these fisheries, globally, are badly managed.
p236
aVSome of the worst issues of our time are connected to it.
p237
aVIt's destroying our oceans.
p238
aVThe worst slavery issues imaginable are connected to it.
p239
aVRecently, an article came out of Stanford
p240
aVsaying that if 50 percent of the world's aquaculture industry
p241
aVwould stop using fish meal,
p242
aVour oceans would be saved.
p243
aVNow think about that for a minute.
p244
aa(lp245
VNow, we know that the oceans have far more problems \u2014
p246
aVthey have pollution, there's acidification,
p247
aVcoral reef destruction and so on.
p248
aVBut it underlines the impact of our fisheries,
p249
aVand it underlines how interconnected everything is.
p250
aVFisheries, aquaculture, deforestation,
p251
aVclimate change, food security and so on.
p252
aa(lp253
VIn the search for alternatives,
p254
aVthe industry, on a massive scale,
p255
aVhas reverted to plant-based alternatives
p256
aVlike soy, industrial chicken waste,
p257
aVblood meal from slaughterhouses
p258
aVand so on.
p259
aa(lp260
VAnd we understand where these choices come from,
p261
aVbut this is not the right approach.
p262
aVIt's not sustainable,
p263
aVit's not healthy.
p264
aVHave you ever seen a chicken at the bottom of the ocean?
p265
aVOf course not.
p266
aVIf you feed salmon soy with nothing else,
p267
aVit literally explodes.
p268
aVSalmon is a carnivore,
p269
aVit has no way to digest soy.
p270
aa(lp271
VNow, fish farming is by far
p272
aVthe best animal farming available to humankind.
p273
aVBut it's had a really bad reputation.
p274
aVThere's been excessive use of chemicals,
p275
aVthere's been virus and disease transfered to wild populations,
p276
aVecosystem destruction and pollution,
p277
aVescaped fish breeding with wild populations,
p278
aValtering the overall genetic pool,
p279
aVand then of course, as just mentioned,
p280
aVthe unsustainable feed ingredients.
p281
aa(lp282
VHow blessed were the days
p283
aVwhen we could just enjoy food that was on our plate,
p284
aVwhatever it was.
p285
aVOnce you know, you know.
p286
aVYou can't go back.
p287
aVIt's not fun.
p288
aVWe really need a transparent food system that we can trust,
p289
aVthat produces healthy food.
p290
aa(lp291
VBut the good news is
p292
aVthat decades of development and research
p293
aVhave led to a lot of new technologies and knowledge
p294
aVthat allow us to do a lot better.
p295
aVWe can now farm fish without any of these issues.
p296
aa(lp297
VI think of agriculture before the green revolution \u2014
p298
aVwe are at aquaculture and the blue revolution.
p299
aVNew technologies means
p300
aVthat we can now produce a feed that's perfectly natural,
p301
aVwith a minimal footprint
p302
aVthat consists of microbes, insects, seaweeds and micro-algae.
p303
aVHealthy for the people,
p304
aVhealthy for the fish,
p305
aVhealthy for the planet.
p306
aa(lp307
VMicrobes, for example,
p308
aVcan be a perfect alternative for high-grade fish meal \u2014
p309
aVat scale.
p310
aa(lp311
VInsects are the \u2014
p312
aVwell, first of all, the perfect recycling
p313
aVbecause they're grown on food waste;
p314
aVbut second,
p315
aVthink of fly-fishing,
p316
aVand you know how logical it actually is to use it as fish feed.
p317
aVYou don't need large tracts of land for it
p318
aVand you don't need to cut down rain forests for it.
p319
aVAnd microbes and insects are actually net water producers.
p320
aa(lp321
VThis revolution is starting as we speak,
p322
aVit just needs scale.
p323
aVWe can now farm far more species than ever before
p324
aVin controlled, natural conditions, creating happy fish.
p325
aa(lp326
VI imagine, for example,
p327
aVa closed system that's performing more efficiently than insect farming,
p328
aVwhere you can produce healthy, happy, delicious fish
p329
aVwith little or no effluent,
p330
aValmost no energy and almost no water
p331
aVand a natural feed with a minimal footprint.
p332
aVOr a system where you grow up to 10 species next to each other \u2014
p333
aVoff of each other,
p334
aVmimicking nature.
p335
aVYou need very little feed,
p336
aVvery little footprint.
p337
aVI think of seaweed growing off the effluent of fish, for example.
p338
aa(lp339
VThere's great technologies popping up all over the globe.
p340
aVFrom alternatives to battle disease
p341
aVso we don't need antibiotics and chemicals anymore,
p342
aVto automated feeders that feel when the fish are hungry,
p343
aVso we can save on feed and create less pollution.
p344
aVSoftware systems that gather data across farms,
p345
aVso we can improve farm practices.
p346
aa(lp347
VThere's really cool stuff happening all over the globe.
p348
aVAnd make no mistake \u2014 all of these things are possible
p349
aVat a cost that's competitive to what a farmer spends today.
p350
aVTomorrow, there will be no excuse for anyone to not do the right thing.
p351
aa(lp352
VSo somebody needs to connect the dots
p353
aVand give these developments a big kick in the butt.
p354
aVAnd that's what we've been working on the last couple of years,
p355
aVand that's what we need to be working on together \u2014
p356
aVrethinking everything from the ground up,
p357
aVwith a holistic view across the value chain,
p358
aVconnecting all these things across the globe,
p359
aValongside great entrepreneurs
p360
aVthat are willing to share a collective vision.
p361
aa(lp362
VNow is the time to create change in this industry
p363
aVand to push it into a sustainable direction.
p364
aVThis industry is still young,
p365
aVmuch of its growth is still ahead.
p366
aVIt's a big task, but not as far-fetched as you might think.
p367
aVIt's possible.
p368
aa(lp369
VSo we need to take pressure off the ocean.
p370
aVWe want to eat good and healthy.
p371
aVAnd if we eat an animal, it needs to be one
p372
aVthat had a happy and healthy life.
p373
aa(lp374
VWe need to have a meal that we can trust,
p375
aVlive long lives.
p376
aVAnd this is not just for people in San Francisco or Northern Europe \u2014
p377
aVthis is for all of us.
p378
aVEven in the poorest countries,
p379
aVit's not just about money.
p380
aVPeople prefer something fresh and healthy that they can trust
p381
aVover something that comes from far away that they know nothing about.
p382
aVWe're all the same.
p383
aa(lp384
VThe day will come
p385
aVwhere people will realize \u2014 no, demand \u2014 farmed fish on their plate
p386
aVthat's farmed well and that's farmed healthy \u2014
p387
aVand refuse anything less.
p388
aa(lp389
VYou can help speed this up.
p390
aVAsk questions when you order seafood.
p391
aVWhere does my fish come from?
p392
aVWho raised it,
p393
aVand what did it eat?
p394
aVInformation about where your fish comes from and how it was produced
p395
aVneeds to be much more readily available.
p396
aVAnd consumers need to put pressure on the aquaculture industry
p397
aVto do the right thing.
p398
aa(lp399
VSo every time you order,
p400
aVask for detail
p401
aVand show that you really care about what you eat
p402
aVand what's been given to you.
p403
aVAnd eventually, they will listen.
p404
aVAnd all of us will benefit.
p405
aa(lp406
VThank you.
