VBruno Giussani: Commissioner, thank you for coming to TED.
p4
aa(lp5
VAntónio Guterres: Pleasure.
p6
aa(lp7
VBG: Let's start with a figure.
p8
aVDuring 2015, almost one million refugees and migrants arrived in Europe
p9
aVfrom many different countries,
p10
aVof course, from Syria and Iraq, but also from Afghanistan
p11
aVand Bangladesh and Eritrea and elsewhere.
p12
aVAnd there have been reactions of two different kinds:
p13
aVwelcoming parties and border fences.
p14
aVBut I want to look at it a little bit
p15
aVfrom the short-term and the long-term perspective.
p16
aVAnd the first question is very simple:
p17
aVWhy has the movement of refugees spiked so fast in the last six months?
p18
aa(lp19
VAG: Well, I think, basically, what triggered this huge increase
p20
aVwas the Syrian refugee group.
p21
aVThere has been an increased movement into Europe from Africa, from Asia,
p22
aVbut slowly growing, and all of a sudden we had this massive increase
p23
aVin the first months of this year.
p24
aVWhy? I think there are three reasons,
p25
aVtwo long-term ones and the trigger.
p26
aVThe long-term ones, in relation to Syrians,
p27
aVis that hope is less and less clear for people.
p28
aVI mean, they look at their own country
p29
aVand they don't see much hope to go back home,
p30
aVbecause there is no political solution,
p31
aVso there is no light at the end of the tunnel.
p32
aVSecond, the living conditions
p33
aVof the Syrians in the neighboring countries have been deteriorating.
p34
aVWe just had research with the World Bank,
p35
aVand 87 percent of the Syrians in Jordan
p36
aVand 93 percent of the Syrians in Lebanon
p37
aVlive below the national poverty lines.
p38
aVOnly half of the children go to school,
p39
aVwhich means that people are living very badly.
p40
aVNot only are they refugees, out of home,
p41
aVnot only have they suffered what they have suffered,
p42
aVbut they are living in very, very dramatic conditions.
p43
aa(lp44
VAnd then the trigger was when all of a sudden,
p45
aVinternational aid decreased.
p46
aVThe World Food Programme was forced, for lack of resources,
p47
aVto cut by 30 percent food support to the Syrian refugees.
p48
aVThey're not allowed to work,
p49
aVso they are totally dependent on international support,
p50
aVand they felt, "The world is abandoning us."
p51
aVAnd that, in my opinion, was the trigger.
p52
aVAll of a sudden, there was a rush,
p53
aVand people started to move in large numbers
p54
aVand, to be absolutely honest,
p55
aVif I had been in the same situation
p56
aVand I would have been brave enough to do it,
p57
aVI think I would have done the same.
p58
aa(lp59
VBG: But I think what surprised many people is it's not only sudden,
p60
aVbut it wasn't supposed to be sudden.
p61
aVThe war in Syria has been happening for five years.
p62
aVMillions of refugees are in camps and villages and towns around Syria.
p63
aVYou have yourself warned about the situation
p64
aVand about the consequences of a breakdown of Libya, for example,
p65
aVand yet Europe looked totally unprepared.
p66
aa(lp67
VAG: Well, unprepared because divided,
p68
aVand when you are divided, you don't want to recognize the reality.
p69
aVYou prefer to postpone decisions,
p70
aVbecause you do not have the capacity to make them.
p71
aVAnd the proof is that even when the spike occurred,
p72
aVEurope remained divided
p73
aVand was unable to put in place a mechanism to manage the situation.
p74
aVYou talk about one million people.
p75
aVIt looks enormous,
p76
aVbut the population of the European Union is 550 million people,
p77
aVwhich means we are talking about one per every [550] Europeans.
p78
aVNow, in Lebanon, we have one refugee per three Lebanese.
p79
aVAnd Lebanon? Struggling, of course, but it's managing.
p80
aVSo, the question is: is this something that could have been managed
p81
aVif \u2014 not mentioning the most important thing,
p82
aVwhich would have been addressing the root causes,
p83
aVbut forgetting about root causes for now,
p84
aVlooking at the phenomenon as it is \u2014
p85
aVif Europe were able to come together in solidarity
p86
aVto create an adequate reception capacity of entry points?
p87
aVBut for that, the countries at entry points need to be massively supported,
p88
aVand then screening the people with security checks
p89
aVand all the other mechanisms,
p90
aVdistributing those that are coming into all European countries,
p91
aVaccording to the possibilities of each country.
p92
aVI mean, if you look at the relocation program
p93
aVthat was approved by the Commission, always too little too late,
p94
aVor by the Council, too little too late \u2014
p95
aa(lp96
VBG: It's already breaking down.
p97
aa(lp98
VAG: My country is supposed to receive four thousand.
p99
aVFour thousand in Portugal means nothing.
p100
aVSo this is perfectly manageable if it is managed,
p101
aVbut in the present circumstances, the pressure is at the point of entry,
p102
aVand then, as people move in this chaotic way through the Balkans,
p103
aVthen they come to Germany, Sweden, basically, and Austria.
p104
aVThey are the three countries that are, in the end, receiving the refugees.
p105
aVThe rest of Europe is looking without doing much.
p106
aa(lp107
VBG: Let me try to bring up three questions,
p108
aVplaying a bit devil's advocate.
p109
aVI'll try to ask them, make them blunt.
p110
aVBut I think the questions are very present
p111
aVin the minds of many people in Europe right now,
p112
aVThe first, of course, is about numbers.
p113
aVYou say 550 million versus one million is not much, but realistically,
p114
aVhow many people can Europe take?
p115
aa(lp116
VAG: Well, that is a question that has no answer,
p117
aVbecause refugees have the right to be protected.
p118
aVAnd there is such a thing as international law,
p119
aVso there is no way you can say, "I take 10,000 and that's finished."
p120
aVI remind you of one thing:
p121
aVin Turkey, at the beginning of the crisis, I remember one minister saying,
p122
aV"Turkey will be able to receive up to 100,000 people."
p123
aVTurkey has now two million three-hundred thousand
p124
aVor something of the sort, if you count all refugees.
p125
aa(lp126
VSo I don't think it's fair to say how many we can take.
p127
aVWhat it is fair to say is: how we can we organize ourselves
p128
aVto assume our international responsibilities?
p129
aVAnd Europe has not been able to do so,
p130
aVbecause basically, Europe is divided because there is no solidarity
p131
aVin the European project.
p132
aVAnd it's not only about refugees; there are many other areas.
p133
aVAnd let's be honest, this is the moment in which we need more Europe
p134
aVinstead of less Europe.
p135
aVBut as the public less and less believes in European institutions,
p136
aVit is also each time more difficult to convince the public
p137
aVthat we need more Europe to solve these problems.
p138
aa(lp139
VBG: We seem to be at the point
p140
aVwhere the numbers turn into political shifts, particularly domestically.
p141
aVWe saw it again this weekend in France,
p142
aVbut we have seen it over and over in many countries:
p143
aVin Poland and in Denmark and in Switzerland and elsewhere,
p144
aVwhere the mood changes radically because of the numbers,
p145
aValthough they are not very significant in absolute numbers.
p146
aVThe Prime Minister of \u2014
p147
aa(lp148
VAG: But, if I may, on these:
p149
aVI mean, what does a European see at home
p150
aVin a village where there are no migrants?
p151
aVWhat a European sees is, on television,
p152
aVevery single day, a few months ago, opening the news every single day,
p153
aVa crowd coming, uncontrolled,
p154
aVmoving from border to border,
p155
aVand the images on television were of hundreds
p156
aVor thousands of people moving.
p157
aVAnd the idea is that nobody is taking care of it \u2014
p158
aVthis is happening without any kind of management.
p159
aVAnd so their idea was, "They are coming to my village."
p160
aVSo there was this completely false idea that Europe was being invaded
p161
aVand our way of life is going to change, and everything will \u2014
p162
aVAnd the problem is that if this had been properly managed,
p163
aVif people had been properly received,
p164
aVwelcomed, sheltered at point of entry, screened at point of entry,
p165
aVand the moved by plane to different European countries,
p166
aVthis would not have scared people.
p167
aVBut, unfortunately, we have a lot of people scared,
p168
aVjust because Europe was not able to do the job properly.
p169
aa(lp170
VBG: But there are villages in Germany
p171
aVwith 300 inhabitants and 1,000 refugees.
p172
aVSo, what's your position?
p173
aVHow do you imagine these people reacting?
p174
aa(lp175
VAG: If there would be a proper management of the situation
p176
aVand the proper distribution of people all over Europe,
p177
aVyou would always have the percentage that I mentioned:
p178
aVone per each 2,000.
p179
aVIt is because things are not properly managed
p180
aVthat in the end we have situations
p181
aVthat are totally impossible to live with, and of course if you have a village \u2014
p182
aVin Lebanon, there are many villages
p183
aVthat have more Syrians than Lebanese; Lebanon has been living with that.
p184
aVI'm not asking for the same to happen in Europe,
p185
aVfor all European villages to have more refugees than inhabitants.
p186
aVWhat I am asking is for Europe to do the job properly,
p187
aVand to be able to organize itself to receive people
p188
aVas other countries in the world were forced to do in the past.
p189
aa(lp190
VBG: So, if you look at the global situation not only at Europe \u2014
p191
aa(lp192
V(Applause)
p193
aa(lp194
VBG: Yes!
p195
aa(lp196
V(Applause)
p197
aa(lp198
VBG: If you look at the global situation, so, not only at Europe,
p199
aVI know you can make a long list of countries
p200
aVthat are not really stepping up,
p201
aVbut I'm more interested in the other part \u2014
p202
aVis there somebody who's doing the right thing?
p203
aa(lp204
VAG: Well, 86 percent of the refugees in the world
p205
aVare in the developing world.
p206
aVAnd if you look at countries like Ethiopia \u2014
p207
aVEthiopia has received more than 600,000 refugees.
p208
aVAll the borders in Ethiopia are open.
p209
aVAnd they have, as a policy,
p210
aVthey call the "people to people" policy that every refugee should be received.
p211
aVAnd they have South Sudanese,
p212
aVthey have Sudanese, they have Somalis.
p213
aVThey have all the neighbors.
p214
aVThey have Eritreans.
p215
aVAnd, in general,
p216
aVAfrican countries are extremely welcoming of refugees coming,
p217
aVand I would say that in the Middle East
p218
aVand in Asia, we have seen a tendency for borders to be open.
p219
aa(lp220
VNow we see some problems with the Syrian situation,
p221
aVas the Syrian situation evolved into also a major security crisis,
p222
aVbut the truth is that for a large period,
p223
aVall borders in the Middle East were open.
p224
aVThe truth is that for Afghans,
p225
aVthe borders of Pakistan and Iran were open for, at the time,
p226
aVsix million Afghans that came.
p227
aVSo I would say that even today, the trend in the developing world
p228
aVhas been for borders to be open.
p229
aVThe trend in the developed world is for these questions to become
p230
aVmore and more complex,
p231
aVespecially when there is, in the public opinion,
p232
aVa mixture of discussions between refugee protections on one side
p233
aVand security questions \u2014 in my opinion, misinterpreted \u2014 on the other side.
p234
aa(lp235
VBG: We'll come back to that too,
p236
aVbut you mentioned the cutting of funding and the vouchers
p237
aVfrom the World Food Programme.
p238
aVThat reflects the general underfunding of the organizations
p239
aVworking on these issues.
p240
aVNow that the world seems to have woken up,
p241
aVare you getting more funding and more support,
p242
aVor it's still the same?
p243
aa(lp244
VAG: We are getting more support.
p245
aVI would say that we are coming close to the levels of last year.
p246
aVWe were much worse during the summer.
p247
aVBut that is clearly insufficient to address the needs of the people
p248
aVand address the needs of the countries
p249
aVthat are supporting the people.
p250
aVAnd here we have a basic review of the criteria, the objectives,
p251
aVthe priorities of development cooperation that is required.
p252
aa(lp253
VFor instance, Lebanon and Jordan are middle-income countries.
p254
aVBecause they are middle-income countries,
p255
aVthey cannot receive soft loans or grants from the World Bank.
p256
aVNow, today this doesn't make any sense,
p257
aVbecause they are providing a global public good.
p258
aVThey have millions of refugees there,
p259
aVand to be honest, they are pillars of stability in the region,
p260
aVwith all the difficulties they face,
p261
aVand the first line of defense of our collective security.
p262
aVSo it doesn't make sense
p263
aVthat these countries are not a first priority
p264
aVin development cooperation policies.
p265
aVAnd they are not.
p266
aVAnd not only do the refugees live in very dramatic circumstances
p267
aVinside those countries,
p268
aVbut the local communities themselves are suffering,
p269
aVbecause salaries went down,
p270
aVbecause there are more unemployed,
p271
aVbecause prices and rents went up.
p272
aVAnd, of course, if you look at today's situation
p273
aVof the indicators in these countries,
p274
aVit is clear that, especially their poor groups of the population,
p275
aVare living worse and worse because of the crisis they are facing.
p276
aa(lp277
VBG: Who should be providing this support?
p278
aVCountry by country, international organizations, the European Union?
p279
aVWho should be coming up with this support?
p280
aa(lp281
VAG: We need to join all efforts.
p282
aVIt's clear that bilateral cooperation is essential.
p283
aVIt's clear that multilateral cooperation is essential.
p284
aVIt's clear that international financial institutions should have flexibility
p285
aVin order to be able to invest more massively
p286
aVin support to these countries.
p287
aVWe need to combine all the instruments and to understand that today,
p288
aVin protracted situations, at a certain moment,
p289
aVthat it doesn't make sense anymore to make a distinction
p290
aVbetween humanitarian aid and development aid
p291
aVor development processes.
p292
aVBecause you are talking about children in school,
p293
aVyou are talking about health,
p294
aVyou are talking about infrastructure that is overcrowded.
p295
aVYou are talking about things that require a long-term perspective,
p296
aVa development perspective
p297
aVand not only an emergency humanitarian aid perspective.
p298
aa(lp299
VBG: I would like your comment on something
p300
aVthat was in newspapers this morning.
p301
aVIt is a statement made by the current front-runner
p302
aVfor the Republican nomination for US President, Donald Trump.
p303
aVYesterday, he said this.
p304
aa(lp305
V(Laughter)
p306
aa(lp307
VNo, listen to this. It's interesting.
p308
aVI quote: "I am calling for a total and complete shutdown
p309
aVof Muslims entering the US,
p310
aVuntil our country's representatives can figure out what's going on."
p311
aVHow do you react to that?
p312
aa(lp313
VAG: Well, it's not only Donald Trump.
p314
aVWe have seen several people around the world
p315
aVwith political responsibility saying, for instance,
p316
aVthat Muslims refugees should not be received.
p317
aVAnd the reason why they say this
p318
aVis because they think that by doing or saying this,
p319
aVthey are protecting the security of their countries.
p320
aVNow, I've been in government.
p321
aVI am very keen on the need for governments
p322
aVto protect the security of their countries
p323
aVand their people.
p324
aVBut if you say, like that,
p325
aVin the US or in any European country,
p326
aV"We are going to close our doors to Muslim refugees,"
p327
aVwhat you are saying is the best possible help
p328
aVfor the propaganda of terrorist organizations.
p329
aVBecause what you are saying \u2014
p330
aa(lp331
V(Applause)
p332
aa(lp333
VWhat you are saying will be heard by all the Muslims in your own country,
p334
aVand it will pave the way for the recruitment
p335
aVand the mechanisms that, through technology,
p336
aVDaesh and al-Nusra, al-Qaeda, and all those other groups
p337
aVare today penetrating in our societies.
p338
aVAnd it's just telling them, "You are right, we are against you."
p339
aVSo obviously, this is creating in societies that are all multiethnic,
p340
aVmulti-religious, multicultural,
p341
aVthis is creating a situation in which, really,
p342
aVit is much easier for the propaganda of these terrorist organizations
p343
aVto be effective in recruiting people for terror acts
p344
aVwithin the countries where these kinds of sentences are expressed.
p345
aa(lp346
VBG: Have the recent attacks in Paris and the reactions to them
p347
aVmade your job more difficult?
p348
aa(lp349
VAG: Undoubtedly.
p350
aa(lp351
VBG: In what sense?
p352
aa(lp353
VAG: In the sense that, I mean, for many people the first reaction
p354
aVin relation to these kinds of terrorist attacks is: close all borders \u2014
p355
aVnot understanding that the terrorist problem in Europe is largely homegrown.
p356
aVWe have thousands and thousands of European fighters in Syria and in Iraq,
p357
aVso this is not something that you solve by just not allowing Syrians to come in.
p358
aVAnd I must say, I am convinced
p359
aVthat the passport that appeared,
p360
aVI believe, was put by the person who has blown \u2014
p361
aa(lp362
VBG: \u2014 himself up, yeah.
p363
aa(lp364
VAG: [I believe] it was on purpose,
p365
aVbecause part of the strategies of Daesh is against refugees,
p366
aVbecause they see refugees as people that should be with the caliphate
p367
aVand are fleeing to the crusaders.
p368
aVAnd I think that is part of Daesh's strategy to make Europe react,
p369
aVclosing its doors to Muslim refugees
p370
aVand having an hostility towards Muslims inside Europe,
p371
aVexactly to facilitate Daesh's work.
p372
aa(lp373
VAnd my deep belief is that it was not the refugee movement
p374
aVthat triggered terrorism.
p375
aVI think, as I said,
p376
aVessentially terrorism in Europe is today a homegrown movement
p377
aVin relation to the global situation that we are facing,
p378
aVand what we need is exactly to prove these groups wrong,
p379
aVby welcoming and integrating effectively
p380
aVthose that are coming from that part of the world.
p381
aa(lp382
VAnd another thing that I believe is that to a large extent,
p383
aVwhat we are today paying for in Europe
p384
aVis the failures of integration models
p385
aVthat didn't work in the '60s, in the '70s, in the '80s,
p386
aVin relation to big migration flows that took place at that time
p387
aVand generated what is today in many of the people, for instance,
p388
aVof the second generation of communities,
p389
aVa situation of feeling marginalized,
p390
aVhaving no jobs,
p391
aVhaving improper education,
p392
aVliving in some of the neighborhoods that are not adequately provided
p393
aVby public infrastructure.
p394
aVAnd this kind of uneasiness, sometimes even anger,
p395
aVthat exists in this second generation
p396
aVis largely due to the failure of integration policies,
p397
aVto the failure of what should have been a much stronger investment
p398
aVin creating the conditions for people to live together and respect each other.
p399
aVFor me it is clear.
p400
aa(lp401
V(Applause)
p402
aa(lp403
VFor me it is clear that all societies will be multiethnic, multicultural,
p404
aVmulti-religious in the future.
p405
aVTo try to avoid it is, in my opinion, impossible.
p406
aVAnd for me it's a good thing that they will be like that,
p407
aVbut I also recognize that, for that to work properly,
p408
aVyou need a huge investment
p409
aVin the social cohesion of your own societies.
p410
aVAnd Europe, to a large extent, failed in that investment
p411
aVin the past few decades.
p412
aa(lp413
VBG: Question: You are stepping down from your job at the end of the year,
p414
aVafter 10 years.
p415
aVIf you look back at 2005,
p416
aVwhen you entered that office for the first time, what do you see?
p417
aa(lp418
VAG: Well, look:
p419
aVIn 2005, we were helping one million people go back home
p420
aVin safety and dignity, because conflicts had ended.
p421
aVLast year, we helped 124,000.
p422
aVIn 2005, we had about 38 million people displaced by conflict in the world.
p423
aVToday, we have more than 60 million.
p424
aVAt that time, we had had, recently,
p425
aVsome conflicts that were solved.
p426
aVNow, we see a multiplication of new conflicts
p427
aVand the old conflicts never died:
p428
aVAfghanistan, Somalia, Democratic Republic of Congo.
p429
aVIt is clear that the world today is much more dangerous than it was.
p430
aVIt is clear that the capacity of the international community
p431
aVto prevent conflicts and to timely solve them,
p432
aVis, unfortunately, much worse than what it was 10 years ago.
p433
aVThere are no clear power relations in the world,
p434
aVno global governance mechanisms that work,
p435
aVwhich means that we live in a situation
p436
aVwhere impunity and unpredictability tend to prevail, and that means
p437
aVthat more and more people suffer,
p438
aVnamely those that are displaced by conflicts.
p439
aa(lp440
VBG: It's a tradition in American politics
p441
aVthat when a President leaves the Oval Office for the last time,
p442
aVhe leaves a handwritten note on the desk for his successor
p443
aVthat walks in a couple of hours later.
p444
aVIf you had to write such a note to your successor, Filippo Grandi,
p445
aVwhat would you write?
