VJambo, bonjour, zdravstvujtye, dayo: these are a few of the languages
p4
aVthat I've spoken little bits of over the course of the last six weeks,
p5
aVas I've been to 17 countries I think I'm up to, on this crazy tour I've been doing,
p6
aVchecking out various aspects of the project that we're doing.
p7
aVAnd I'm going to tell you a little bit about later on.
p8
aVAnd visiting some pretty incredible places,
p9
aVplaces like Mongolia, Cambodia, New Guinea, South Africa, Tanzania twice \u2014
p10
aVI was here a month ago.
p11
aa(lp12
VAnd the opportunity to make a whirlwind tour of the world like that
p13
aVis utterly amazing, for lots of reasons.
p14
aVYou see some incredible stuff.
p15
aVAnd you get to make these spot comparisons
p16
aVbetween people all around the globe.
p17
aVAnd the thing that you really take away from that,
p18
aVthe kind of surface thing that you take away from it,
p19
aVis not that we're all one, although I'm going to tell you about that,
p20
aVbut rather how different we are.
p21
aVThere is so much diversity around the globe.
p22
aV6,000 different languages spoken by six and a half billion people,
p23
aVall different colors, shapes, sizes.
p24
aVYou walk down the street in any big city, you travel like that,
p25
aVand you are amazed at the diversity in the human species.
p26
aa(lp27
VHow do we explain that diversity?
p28
aVWell, that's what I'm going to talk about today,
p29
aVis how we're using the tools of genetics,
p30
aVpopulation genetics in particular, to tell us how we generated this diversity,
p31
aVand how long it took.
p32
aVNow, the problem of human diversity,
p33
aVlike all big scientific questions \u2014
p34
aVhow do you explain something like that \u2014
p35
aVcan be broken down into sub-questions.
p36
aVAnd you can ferret away at those little sub-questions.
p37
aa(lp38
VFirst one is really a question of origins.
p39
aVDo we all share a common origin, in fact?
p40
aVAnd given that we do \u2014 and that's the assumption
p41
aVeverybody, I think, in this room would make \u2014 when was that?
p42
aVWhen did we originate as a species?
p43
aVHow long have we been divergent from each other?
p44
aa(lp45
VAnd the second question is related, but slightly different.
p46
aVIf we do spring from a common source,
p47
aVhow did we come to occupy every corner of the globe,
p48
aVand in the process generate all of this diversity,
p49
aVthe different ways of life, the different appearances,
p50
aVthe different languages around the world?
p51
aa(lp52
VWell, the question of origins, as with so many other questions in biology,
p53
aVseems to have been answered by Darwin over a century ago.
p54
aVIn "The Descent of Man," he wrote,
p55
aV"In each great region of the world, the living mammals
p56
aVare closely related to the extinct species of the same region.
p57
aVIt's therefore probable that Africa was formerly inhabited by extinct apes
p58
aVclosely allied to the gorilla and chimpanzee,
p59
aVand as these two species are now man's nearest allies,
p60
aVit's somewhat more probable that our early progenitors
p61
aVlived on the African continent than elsewhere."
p62
aa(lp63
VSo we're done, we can go home \u2014 finished the origin question.
p64
aVWell, not quite. Because Darwin was talking about our distant ancestry,
p65
aVour common ancestry with apes.
p66
aVAnd it is quite clear that apes originated on the African continent.
p67
aVAround 23 million years ago, they appear in the fossil record.
p68
aVAfrica was actually disconnected from the other landmasses at that time,
p69
aVdue to the vagaries of plate tectonics, floating around the Indian Ocean.
p70
aVBumped into Eurasia around 16 million years ago,
p71
aVand then we had the first African exodus, as we call it.
p72
aVThe apes that left at that time ended up in Southeast Asia,
p73
aVbecame the gibbons and the orangutans.
p74
aVAnd the ones that stayed on in Africa
p75
aVevolved into the gorillas, the chimpanzees and us.
p76
aVSo, yes, if you're talking about our common ancestry with apes,
p77
aVit's very clear, by looking at the fossil record, we started off here.
p78
aa(lp79
VBut that's not really the question I'm asking.
p80
aVI'm asking about our human ancestry,
p81
aVthings that we would recognize as being like us
p82
aVif they were sitting here in the room.
p83
aVIf they were peering over your shoulder,
p84
aVyou wouldn't leap back, like that. What about our human ancestry?
p85
aVBecause if we go far enough back,
p86
aVwe share a common ancestry with every living thing on Earth.
p87
aVDNA ties us all together, so we share ancestry with barracuda
p88
aVand bacteria and mushrooms, if you go far enough back \u2014 over a billion years.
p89
aVWhat we're asking about though is human ancestry.
p90
aVHow do we study that?
p91
aa(lp92
VWell, historically, it has been studied using the science of paleoanthropology.
p93
aVDigging things up out of the ground,
p94
aVand largely on the basis of morphology \u2014
p95
aVthe way things are shaped, often skull shape \u2014 saying,
p96
aV"This looks a little bit more like us than that, so this must be my ancestor.
p97
aVThis must be who I'm directly descended from."
p98
aa(lp99
VThe field of paleoanthropology, I'll argue,
p100
aVgives us lots of fascinating possibilities about our ancestry,
p101
aVbut it doesn't give us the probabilities that we really want as scientists.
p102
aVWhat do I mean by that?
p103
aVYou're looking at a great example here.
p104
aVThese are three extinct species of hominids,
p105
aVpotential human ancestors.
p106
aVAll dug up just west of here in Olduvai Gorge, by the Leakey family.
p107
aVAnd they're all dating to roughly the same time.
p108
aVFrom left to right, we've got Homo erectus, Homo habilis,
p109
aVand Australopithecus \u2014 now called Paranthropus boisei,
p110
aVthe robust australopithecine. Three extinct species, same place, same time.
p111
aVThat means that not all three could be my direct ancestor.
p112
aVWhich one of these guys am I actually related to?
p113
aVPossibilities about our ancestry, but not the probabilities that we're really looking for.
p114
aa(lp115
VWell, a different approach has been to look at morphology in humans
p116
aVusing the only data that people really had at hand until quite recently \u2014
p117
aVagain, largely skull shape.
p118
aVThe first person to do this systematically was Linnaeus,
p119
aVCarl von Linne, a Swedish botanist,
p120
aVwho in the eighteenth century took it upon himself
p121
aVto categorize every living organism on the planet.
p122
aVYou think you've got a tough job?
p123
aVAnd he did a pretty good job.
p124
aVHe categorized about 12,000 species in "Systema Naturae."
p125
aVHe actually coined the term Homo sapiens \u2014 it means wise man in Latin.
p126
aVBut looking around the world at the diversity of humans, he said,
p127
aV"Well, you know, we seem to come in discreet sub-species or categories."
p128
aVAnd he talked about Africans and Americans and Asians and Europeans,
p129
aVand a blatantly racist category he termed "Monstrosus,"
p130
aVwhich basically included all the people he didn't like,
p131
aVincluding imaginary folk like elves.
p132
aa(lp133
VIt's easy to dismiss this as the perhaps well-intentioned
p134
aVbut ultimately benighted musings of an eighteenth century scientist
p135
aVworking in the pre-Darwinian era.
p136
aVExcept, if you had taken physical anthropology
p137
aVas recently as 20 or 30 years ago, in many cases you would have learned
p138
aVbasically that same classification of humanity.
p139
aVHuman races that according to physical anthropologists of 30, 40 years ago \u2014
p140
aVCarlton Coon is the best example \u2014
p141
aVhad been diverging from each other \u2014 this was in the post-Darwinian era \u2014
p142
aVfor over a million years, since the time of Homo erectus.
p143
aVBut based on what data?
p144
aVVery little. Very little. Morphology and a lot of guesswork.
p145
aa(lp146
VWell, what I'm going to talk about today,
p147
aVwhat I'm going to talk about now is a new approach to this problem.
p148
aVInstead of going out and guessing about our ancestry,
p149
aVdigging things up out of the ground, possible ancestors,
p150
aVand saying it on the basis of morphology \u2014
p151
aVwhich we still don't completely understand,
p152
aVwe don't know the genetic causes underlying this morphological variation \u2014
p153
aa(lp154
Vwhat we need to do is turn the problem on its head.
p155
aVBecause what we're really asking is a genealogical problem,
p156
aVor a genealogical question.
p157
aVWhat we're trying to do is construct a family tree for everybody alive today.
p158
aVAnd as any genealogist will tell you \u2014
p159
aVanybody have a member of the family, or maybe you
p160
aVhave tried to construct a family tree, trace back in time?
p161
aVYou start in the present, with relationships you're certain about.
p162
aVYou and your siblings, you have a parent in common.
p163
aVYou and your cousins share a grandparent in common.
p164
aVYou gradually trace further and further back into the past,
p165
aVadding these ever more distant relationships.
p166
aVBut eventually, no matter how good you are at digging up the church records,
p167
aVand all that stuff, you hit what the genealogists call a brick wall.
p168
aVA point beyond which you don't know anything else about your ancestors,
p169
aVand you enter this dark and mysterious realm we call history
p170
aVthat we have to feel our way through with whispered guidance.
p171
aa(lp172
VWho were these people who came before?
p173
aVWe have no written record. Well, actually, we do.
p174
aVWritten in our DNA, in our genetic code \u2014
p175
aVwe have a historical document that takes us back in time
p176
aVto the very earliest days of our species. And that's what we study.
p177
aa(lp178
VNow, a quick primer on DNA.
p179
aVI suspect that not everybody in the audience is a geneticist.
p180
aVIt is a very long, linear molecule, a coded version
p181
aVof how to make another copy of you. It's your blueprint.
p182
aVIt's composed of four subunits: A, C, G and T, we call them.
p183
aVAnd it's the sequence of those subunits that defines that blueprint.
p184
aVHow long is it? Well, it's billions of these subunits in length.
p185
aVA haploid genome \u2014 we actually have two copies of all of our chromosomes \u2014
p186
aVa haploid genome is around 3.2 billion nucleotides in length.
p187
aVAnd the whole thing, if you add it all together,
p188
aVis over six billion nucleotides long.
p189
aVIf you take all the DNA out of one cell in your body,
p190
aVand stretch it end to end, it's around two meters long.
p191
aVIf you take all the DNA out of every cell in your body,
p192
aVand you stretch it end to end, it would reach from here to the moon and back,
p193
aVthousands of times. It's a lot of information.
p194
aa(lp195
VAnd so when you're copying this DNA molecule to pass it on, it's a pretty tough job.
p196
aVImagine the longest book you can think of, "War and Peace."
p197
aVNow multiply it by 100.
p198
aVAnd imagine copying that by hand.
p199
aVAnd you're working away until late at night,
p200
aVand you're very, very careful, and you're drinking coffee
p201
aVand you're paying attention, but, occasionally,
p202
aVwhen you're copying this by hand,
p203
aVyou're going to make a little typo, a spelling mistake \u2014
p204
aVsubstitute an I for an E, or a C for a T.
p205
aa(lp206
VSame thing happens to our DNA as it's being passed on through the generations.
p207
aVIt doesn't happen very often. We have a proofreading mechanism built in.
p208
aVBut when it does happen, and these changes get transmitted down
p209
aVthrough the generations, they become markers of descent.
p210
aVIf you share a marker with someone,
p211
aVit means you share an ancestor at some point in the past,
p212
aVthe person who first had that change in their DNA.
p213
aVAnd it's by looking at the pattern of genetic variation,
p214
aVthe pattern of these markers in people all over the world,
p215
aVand assessing the relative ages when they occurred throughout our history,
p216
aVthat we've been able to construct a family tree for everybody alive today.
p217
aa(lp218
VThese are two pieces of DNA that we use quite widely in our work.
p219
aVMitochondrial DNA, tracing a purely maternal line of descent.
p220
aVYou get your mtDNA from your mother, and your mother's mother,
p221
aVall the way back to the very first woman.
p222
aVThe Y chromosome, the piece of DNA that makes men men,
p223
aVtraces a purely paternal line of descent.
p224
aVEverybody in this room, everybody in the world,
p225
aVfalls into a lineage somewhere on these trees.
p226
aVNow, even though these are simplified versions of the real trees,
p227
aVthey're still kind of complicated, so let's simplify them.
p228
aVTurn them on their sides, combine them so that they look like a tree
p229
aVwith the root at the bottom and the branches going up.
p230
aVWhat's the take-home message?
p231
aa(lp232
VWell, the thing that jumps out at you first
p233
aVis that the deepest lineages in our family trees
p234
aVare found within Africa, among Africans.
p235
aVThat means that Africans have been accumulating
p236
aVthis mutational diversity for longer.
p237
aVAnd what that means is that we originated in Africa. It's written in our DNA.
p238
aVEvery piece of DNA we look at has greater diversity within Africa than outside of Africa.
p239
aVAnd at some point in the past, a sub-group of Africans
p240
aVleft the African continent to go out and populate the rest of the world.
p241
aa(lp242
VNow, how recently do we share this ancestry?
p243
aVWas it millions of years ago, which we might suspect
p244
aVby looking at all this incredible variation around the world?
p245
aVNo, the DNA tells a story that's very clear.
p246
aVWithin the last 200,000 years, we all share an ancestor, a single person \u2014
p247
aVMitochondrial Eve, you might have heard about her \u2014 in Africa,
p248
aVan African woman who gave rise to all the mitochondrial diversity in the world today.
p249
aa(lp250
VBut what's even more amazing
p251
aVis that if you look at the Y-chromosome side,
p252
aVthe male side of the story, the Y-chromosome Adam
p253
aVonly lived around 60,000 years ago.
p254
aVThat's only about 2,000 human generations,
p255
aVthe blink of an eye in an evolutionary sense.
p256
aVThat tells us we were all still living in Africa at that time.
p257
aVThis was an African man who gave rise
p258
aVto all the Y chromosome diversity around the world.
p259
aVIt's only within the last 60,000 years
p260
aVthat we have started to generate this incredible diversity we see around the world.
p261
aVSuch an amazing story.
p262
aVWe're all effectively part of an extended African family.
p263
aa(lp264
VNow, that seems so recent. Why didn't we start to leave earlier?
p265
aVWhy didn't Homo erectus evolve into separate species,
p266
aVor sub-species rather, human races around the world?
p267
aVWhy was it that we seem to have come out of Africa so recently?
p268
aVWell, that's a big question. These "why" questions,
p269
aVparticularly in genetics and the study of history in general, are always the big ones,
p270
aVthe ones that are tough to answer.
p271
aa(lp272
VAnd so when all else fails, talk about the weather.
p273
aVWhat was going on to the world's weather around 60,000 years ago?
p274
aVWell, we were going into the worst part of the last ice age.
p275
aVThe last ice age started roughly 120,000 years ago.
p276
aVIt went up and down, and it really started to accelerate around 70,000 years ago.
p277
aVLots of evidence from sediment cores
p278
aVand the pollen types, oxygen isotopes and so on.
p279
aVWe hit the last glacial maximum around 16,000 years ago,
p280
aVbut basically, from 70,000 years on, things were getting really tough,
p281
aVgetting very cold. The Northern Hemisphere had massive growing ice sheets.
p282
aVNew York City, Chicago, Seattle, all under a sheet of ice.
p283
aVMost of Britain, all of Scandinavia, covered by ice several kilometers thick.
p284
aa(lp285
VNow, Africa is the most tropical continent on the planet \u2014
p286
aVabout 85 percent of it lies between Cancer and Capricorn \u2014
p287
aVand there aren't a lot of glaciers here,
p288
aVexcept on the high mountains here in East Africa.
p289
aVSo what was going on here? We weren't covered in ice in Africa.
p290
aVRather, Africa was drying out at that time.
p291
aVThis is a paleo-climatological map
p292
aVof what Africa looked like between 60,000 and 70,000 years ago,
p293
aVreconstructed from all these pieces of evidence that I mentioned before.
p294
aVThe reason for that is that ice actually sucks moisture out of the atmosphere.
p295
aVIf you think about Antarctica, it's technically a desert, it gets so little precipitation.
p296
aa(lp297
VSo the whole world was drying out.
p298
aVThe sea levels were dropping. And Africa was turning to desert.
p299
aVThe Sahara was much bigger then than it is now.
p300
aVAnd the human habitat was reduced to just a few small pockets,
p301
aVcompared to what we have today.
p302
aVThe evidence from genetic data
p303
aVis that the human population around this time, roughly 70,000 years ago,
p304
aVcrashed to fewer than 2,000 individuals.
p305
aVWe nearly went extinct. We were hanging on by our fingernails.
p306
aa(lp307
VAnd then something happened. A great illustration of it.
p308
aVLook at some stone tools.
p309
aVThe ones on the left are from Africa, from around a million years ago.
p310
aVThe ones on the right were made by Neanderthals, our distant cousins,
p311
aVnot our direct ancestors, living in Europe,
p312
aVand they date from around 50,000 or 60,000 years ago.
p313
aVNow, at the risk of offending any paleoanthropologists
p314
aVor physical anthropologists in the audience,
p315
aVbasically there's not a lot of change between these two stone tool groups.
p316
aVThe ones on the left are pretty similar to the ones on the right.
p317
aVWe are in a period of long cultural stasis from a million years ago
p318
aVuntil around 60,000 to 70,000 years ago.
p319
aVThe tool styles don't change that much.
p320
aVThe evidence is that the human way of life
p321
aVdidn't change that much during that period.
p322
aa(lp323
VBut then 50, 60, 70 thousand years ago, somewhere in that region,
p324
aVall hell breaks loose. Art makes its appearance.
p325
aVThe stone tools become much more finely crafted.
p326
aVThe evidence is that humans begin to specialize in particular prey species,
p327
aVat particular times of the year.
p328
aVThe population size started to expand.
p329
aVProbably, according to what many linguists believe,
p330
aVfully modern language, syntactic language \u2014 subject, verb, object \u2014
p331
aVthat we use to convey complex ideas, like I'm doing now, appeared around that time.
p332
aVWe became much more social. The social networks expanded.
p333
aa(lp334
VThis change in behavior allowed us to survive these worsening conditions in Africa,
p335
aVand they allowed us to start to expand around the world.
p336
aVWe've been talking at this conference about African success stories.
p337
aVWell, you want the ultimate African success story?
p338
aVLook in the mirror. You're it. The reason you're alive today
p339
aVis because of those changes in our brains that took place in Africa \u2014
p340
aVprobably somewhere in the region where we're sitting right now,
p341
aVaround 60, 70 thousand years ago \u2014
p342
aVallowing us not only to survive in Africa, but to expand out of Africa.
p343
aVAn early coastal migration along the south coast of Asia,
p344
aVleaving Africa around 60,000 years ago,
p345
aVreaching Australia very rapidly, by 50,000 years ago.
p346
aVA slightly later migration up into the Middle East.
p347
aVThese would have been savannah hunters.
p348
aa(lp349
VSo those of you who are going on one of the post-conference tours,
p350
aVyou'll get to see what a real savannah is like.
p351
aVAnd it's basically a meat locker.
p352
aVPeople who would have specialized in killing the animals,
p353
aVhunting the animals on those meat locker savannahs, moving up,
p354
aVfollowing the grasslands into the Middle East around 45,000 years ago,
p355
aVduring one of the rare wet phases in the Sahara.
p356
aVMigrating eastward, following the grasslands,
p357
aVbecause that's what they were adapted to live on.
p358
aa(lp359
VAnd when they reached Central Asia,
p360
aVthey reached what was effectively a steppe super-highway,
p361
aVa grassland super-highway.
p362
aVThe grasslands at that time \u2014 this was during the last ice age \u2014
p363
aVstretched basically from Germany all the way over to Korea,
p364
aVand the entire continent was open to them.
p365
aVEntering Europe around 35,000 years ago,
p366
aVand finally, a small group migrating up
p367
aVthrough the worst weather imaginable, Siberia,
p368
aVinside the Arctic Circle, during the last ice age \u2014
p369
aVtemperature was at -70, -80, even -100, perhaps \u2014
p370
aVmigrating into the Americas, ultimately reaching that final frontier.
p371
aa(lp372
VAn amazing story, and it happened first in Africa.
p373
aVThe changes that allowed us to do that,
p374
aVthe evolution of this highly adaptable brain that we all carry around with us,
p375
aVallowing us to create novel cultures,
p376
aVallowing us to develop the diversity
p377
aVthat we see on a whirlwind trip like the one I've just been on.
p378
aa(lp379
VNow, that story I just told you is literally a whirlwind tour
p380
aVof how we populated the world, the great Paleolithic wanderings of our species.
p381
aVAnd that's the story that I told a couple of years ago
p382
aVin my book, "The Journey of Man," and a film that we made with the same title.
p383
aVAnd as we were finishing up that film \u2014
p384
aVit was co-produced with National Geographic \u2014
p385
aVI started talking to the folks at NG about this work.
p386
aVAnd they got really excited about it. They liked the film, but they said,
p387
aV"You know, we really see this as kind of
p388
aVthe next wave in the study of human origins, where we all came from,
p389
aVusing the tools of DNA to map the migrations around the world.
p390
aVYou know, the study of human origins is kind of in our DNA,
p391
aVand we want to take it to the next level.
p392
aVWhat do you want to do next?"
p393
aVWhich is a great question to be asked by National Geographic.
p394
aa(lp395
VAnd I said, "Well, you know, what I've sketched out here is just that.
p396
aVIt is a very coarse sketch of how we migrated around the planet.
p397
aVAnd it's based on a few thousand people we've sampled from,
p398
aVyou know, a handful of populations around the world.
p399
aVStudied a few genetic markers, and there are lots of gaps on this map.
p400
aVWe've just connected the dots. What we need to do
p401
aVis increase our sample size by an order of magnitude or more \u2014
p402
aVhundreds of thousands of DNA samples from people all over the world."
p403
aa(lp404
VAnd that was the genesis of the Genographic Project.
p405
aVThe project launched in April 2005.
p406
aVIt has three core components. Obviously, science is a big part of it.
p407
aVThe field research that we're doing around the world with indigenous peoples.
p408
aVPeople who have lived in the same location for a long period of time
p409
aVretain a connection to the place where they live
p410
aVthat many of the rest of us have lost.
p411
aVSo my ancestors come from all over northern Europe.
p412
aVI live in the Eastern Seaboard of North America when I'm not traveling.
p413
aVWhere am I indigenous to? Nowhere really. My genes are all jumbled up.
p414
aVBut there are people who retain that link to their ancestors
p415
aVthat allows us to contextualize the DNA results.
p416
aa(lp417
VThat's the focus of the field research,
p418
aVthe centers that we've set up all over the world \u2014
p419
aV10 of them, top population geneticists.
p420
aVBut, in addition, we wanted to open up this study to anybody around the world.
p421
aVHow often do you get to participate in a big scientific project?
p422
aVThe Human Genome Project, or a Mars Rover mission.
p423
aa(lp424
VIn this case, you actually can.
p425
aVYou can go onto our website, Nationalgeographic.com/genographic.
p426
aVYou can order a kit. You can test your own DNA.
p427
aVAnd you can actually submit those results to the database,
p428
aVand tell us a little about your genealogical background,
p429
aVhave the data analyzed as part of the scientific effort.
p430
aa(lp431
VNow, this is all a nonprofit enterprise, and so the money that we raise,
p432
aVafter we cover the cost of doing the testing and making the kit components,
p433
aVgets plowed back into the project.
p434
aVThe majority going to something we call the Legacy Fund.
p435
aVIt's a charitable entity, basically a grant-giving entity
p436
aVthat gives money back to indigenous groups around the world
p437
aVfor educational, cultural projects initiated by them.
p438
aVThey apply to this fund in order to do various projects,
p439
aVand I'll show you a couple of examples.
p440
aa(lp441
VSo how are we doing on the project? We've got about 25,000 samples
p442
aVcollected from indigenous people around the world.
p443
aVThe most amazing thing has been the interest on the part of the public;
p444
aV210,000 people have ordered these participation kits
p445
aVsince we launched two years ago,
p446
aVwhich has raised around five million dollars,
p447
aVthe majority of which, at least half, is going back into the Legacy Fund.
p448
aa(lp449
VWe've just awarded the first Legacy Grants totaling around 500,000 dollars.
p450
aVProjects around the world \u2014 documenting oral poetry in Sierra Leone,
p451
aVpreserving traditional weaving patterns in Gaza,
p452
aVlanguage revitalization in Tajikistan, etc., etc.
p453
aVSo the project is going very, very well,
p454
aVand I urge you to check out the website and watch this space.
p455
aa(lp456
VThank you very much.
