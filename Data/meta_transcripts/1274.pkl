VHave you ever wanted to stay young a little longer
p4
aVand put off aging?
p5
aVThis is a dream of the ages.
p6
aVBut scientists have for a long time
p7
aVthought this just was never going to be possible.
p8
aVThey thought you just wear out, there's nothing you can do about it \u2014
p9
aVkind of like an old shoe.
p10
aVBut if you look in nature,
p11
aVyou see that different kinds of animals
p12
aVcan have really different lifespans.
p13
aVNow these animals are different from one another,
p14
aVbecause they have different genes.
p15
aVSo that suggests
p16
aVthat somewhere in these genes, somewhere in the DNA,
p17
aVare genes for aging,
p18
aVgenes that allow them to have different lifespans.
p19
aVSo if there are genes like that,
p20
aVthen you can imagine that,
p21
aVif you could change one of the genes in an experiment,
p22
aVan aging gene,
p23
aVmaybe you could slow down aging and extend lifespan.
p24
aVAnd if you could do that, then you could find the genes for aging.
p25
aVAnd if they exist and you can find them,
p26
aVthen maybe one could eventually do something about it.
p27
aa(lp28
VSo we've set out to look for genes that control aging.
p29
aVAnd we didn't study any of these animals.
p30
aVInstead, we studied a little, tiny, round worm called C. elegans,
p31
aVwhich is just about the size of a comma in a sentence.
p32
aVAnd we were really optimistic that we could find something
p33
aVbecause there had been a report of a long-lived mutant.
p34
aVSo we started to change genes at random,
p35
aVlooking for long-lived animals.
p36
aVAnd we were very lucky to find
p37
aVthat mutations that damage one single gene called daf-2
p38
aVdoubled the lifespan of the little worm.
p39
aa(lp40
VSo you can see in black, after a month \u2014
p41
aVthey're very short-lived; that's why we like to study them
p42
aVfor studies of aging \u2014
p43
aVin black, after a month, the normal worms are all dead.
p44
aVBut at that time,
p45
aVmost of the mutant worms are still alive.
p46
aVAnd it isn't until twice as long
p47
aVthat they're all dead.
p48
aVAnd now I want to show what they actually look like in this movie here.
p49
aVSo the first thing you're going to see
p50
aVis the normal worm
p51
aVwhen it's about college student age \u2014 a young adult.
p52
aVIt's quite a cute little fellow.
p53
aVAnd next you're going to see the long-lived mutant when it's young.
p54
aVSo this animal is going to live twice as long.
p55
aVIs it miserable? It doesn't seem to be.
p56
aVIt's active. You can't tell the difference really.
p57
aVAnd they can be completely fertile \u2014
p58
aVhave the same number of progeny as the normal worms do.
p59
aa(lp60
VNow get out your handkerchiefs here.
p61
aVYou're going to see, in just two weeks,
p62
aVthe normal worms are old.
p63
aVYou can see the little head moving down at the bottom there.
p64
aVBut everything else is just lying there.
p65
aVThe animal's clearly in the nursing home.
p66
aVAnd if you look at the tissues of the animal, they're starting to deteriorate.
p67
aVYou know, even if you've never seen one of these little C. elegans \u2014
p68
aVwhich probably most of you haven't seen one \u2014
p69
aVyou can tell they're old \u2014 isn't that interesting?
p70
aa(lp71
VSo there's something about aging that's kind of universal.
p72
aVAnd now here is the daf-2 mutant.
p73
aVOne gene is changed out of 20,000, and look at it.
p74
aVIt's the same age, but it's not in the nursing home;
p75
aVit's going skiing.
p76
aVThis is what's really cool: it's aging more slowly.
p77
aVIt takes this worm two days
p78
aVto age as much as the normal worm ages in one day.
p79
aVAnd when I tell people about this,
p80
aVthey tend to think of maybe an 80 or 90 year-old person
p81
aVwho looks really good for being 90 or 80.
p82
aVBut it's really more like this:
p83
aVlet's say you're a 30 year-old guy \u2014 or in your 30s \u2014
p84
aVand you're a bachelor and you're dating people.
p85
aVAnd you meet someone you really like, you get to know her.
p86
aVAnd you're in a restaurant, and you say, "Well how old are you?"
p87
aVShe says, "I'm 60."
p88
aVThat's what it's like. And you would never know.
p89
aVYou would never know, until she told you.
p90
aa(lp91
V(Laughter)
p92
aa(lp93
VOkay.
p94
aVSo what is the daf-2 gene?
p95
aVWell as you know, genes, which are part of the DNA,
p96
aVthey're instructions to make a protein that does something.
p97
aVAnd the daf-2 gene
p98
aVencodes a hormone receptor.
p99
aVSo what you see in the picture there
p100
aVis a cell with a hormone receptor in red
p101
aVpunching through the edge of the cell.
p102
aVSo part of it is like a baseball glove.
p103
aVPart of it's on the outside,
p104
aVand it's catching the hormone as it comes by in green.
p105
aVAnd the other part is on the inside
p106
aVwhere it sends signals into the cell.
p107
aa(lp108
VOkay, so what is the daf-2 receptor
p109
aVtelling the inside of the cell?
p110
aVI just told you that, if you make a mutation in the daf-2 gene cell,
p111
aVthat you get a receptor that doesn't work as well;
p112
aVthe animal lives longer.
p113
aVSo that means that the normal function of this hormone receptor
p114
aVis to speed up aging.
p115
aVThat's what that arrow means.
p116
aVIt speeds up aging. It makes it go faster.
p117
aVSo it's like the animal has the grim reaper inside of itself,
p118
aVspeeding up aging.
p119
aVSo this is altogether really, really interesting.
p120
aVIt says that aging is subject to control by the genes,
p121
aVand specifically by hormones.
p122
aVSo what kind of hormones are these?
p123
aVThere's lots of hormones. There's testosterone, adrenalin.
p124
aVYou know about a lot of them.
p125
aVThese hormones are similar
p126
aVto hormones that we have in our bodies.
p127
aVThe daf-2 hormone receptor
p128
aVis very similar to the receptor
p129
aVfor the hormone insulin and IGF-1.
p130
aa(lp131
VNow you've all heard of at least insulin.
p132
aVInsulin is a hormone that promotes the uptake of nutrients
p133
aVinto your tissues after you eat a meal.
p134
aVAnd the hormone IGF-1 promotes growth.
p135
aVSo these functions were known for these hormones for a long time,
p136
aVbut our studies suggested
p137
aVthat maybe they had a third function that nobody knew about \u2014
p138
aVmaybe they also affect aging.
p139
aVAnd it's looking like that's the case.
p140
aa(lp141
VSo after we made our discoveries with little C. elegans,
p142
aVpeople who worked on other kinds of animals
p143
aVstarted asking, if we made the same daf-2 mutation,
p144
aVthe hormone receptor mutation, in other animals,
p145
aVwill they live longer?
p146
aVAnd that is the case in flies.
p147
aVIf you change this hormone pathway in flies, they live longer.
p148
aVAnd also in mice \u2014 and mice are mammals like us.
p149
aVSo it's an ancient pathway,
p150
aVbecause it must have arisen a long time ago in evolution
p151
aVsuch that it still works in all these animals.
p152
aVAnd also, the common precursor also gave rise to people.
p153
aa(lp154
VSo maybe it's working in people the same way.
p155
aVAnd there are hints of this.
p156
aVSo for example, there was one study that was done
p157
aVin a population of Ashkenazi Jews in New York City.
p158
aVAnd just like any population,
p159
aVmost of the people live to be about 70 or 80,
p160
aVbut some live to be 90 or 100.
p161
aVAnd what they found
p162
aVwas that people who lived to 90 or 100
p163
aVwere more likely to have daf-2 mutations \u2014
p164
aVthat is, changes in the gene
p165
aVthat encodes the receptor for IGF-1.
p166
aVAnd these changes made the gene not act as well
p167
aVas the normal gene would have acted.
p168
aVIt damaged the gene.
p169
aVSo those are hints
p170
aVsuggesting that humans are susceptible
p171
aVto the effects of the hormones for aging.
p172
aa(lp173
VSo the next question, of course, is:
p174
aVIs there any effect on age-related disease?
p175
aVAs you age, you're much more likely
p176
aVto get cancer, Alzheimer's disease,
p177
aVheart disease, all sorts of diseases.
p178
aVIt turns out that these long-lived mutants
p179
aVare more resistant to all these diseases.
p180
aVThey hardly get cancer,
p181
aVand when they do it's not as severe.
p182
aVSo it's really interesting, and it makes sense in a way,
p183
aVthat they're still young,
p184
aVso why would they be getting diseases of aging until their old?
p185
aVSo it suggests
p186
aVthat, if we could have a therapeutic or a pill to take
p187
aVto replicate some of these effects in humans,
p188
aVmaybe we would have a way
p189
aVof combating lots of different age-related diseases
p190
aVall at once.
p191
aVSo how can a hormone ultimately affect the rate of aging?
p192
aVHow could that work?
p193
aa(lp194
VWell it turns out that in the daf-2 mutants,
p195
aVa whole lot of genes are switched on in the DNA
p196
aVthat encode proteins that protect the cells and the tissues,
p197
aVand repair damage.
p198
aVAnd the way that they're switched on
p199
aVis by a gene regulator protein called FOXO.
p200
aVSo in a daf-2 mutant \u2014
p201
aVyou see that I have the X drawn here through the receptor.
p202
aVThe receptor isn't working as well.
p203
aVUnder those conditions, the FOXO protein in blue
p204
aVhas gone into the nucleus \u2014
p205
aVthat little compartment there in the middle of the cell \u2014
p206
aVand it's sitting down on a gene binding to it.
p207
aVYou see one gene. There are lots of genes actually that bind on FOXO.
p208
aVAnd it's just sitting on one of them.
p209
aa(lp210
VSo FOXO turns on a lot of genes.
p211
aVAnd the genes it turns on includes antioxidant genes,
p212
aVgenes I call carrot-giver genes,
p213
aVwhose protein products
p214
aVactually help other proteins to function well \u2014
p215
aVto fold correctly and function correctly.
p216
aVAnd it can also escort them to the garbage cans of the cell
p217
aVand recycle them if they're damaged.
p218
aVDNA repair genes
p219
aVare more active in these animals.
p220
aVAnd the immune system is more active.
p221
aVAnd many of these different genes, we've shown,
p222
aVactually contribute to the long lifespan of the daf-2 mutant.
p223
aVSo it's really interesting.
p224
aVThese animals have within them
p225
aVthe latent capacity to live much longer than they normally do.
p226
aVThey have the ability
p227
aVto protect themselves from many kinds of damage,
p228
aVwhich we think makes them live longer.
p229
aa(lp230
VSo what about the normal worm?
p231
aVWell when the daf-2 receptor is active,
p232
aVthen it triggers a series of events
p233
aVthat prevent FOXO
p234
aVfrom getting into the nucleus where the DNA is.
p235
aVSo it can't turn the genes on.
p236
aVThat's how it works. That's why we don't see the long lifespan,
p237
aVuntil we have the daf-2 mutant.
p238
aVBut what good is this for the worm?
p239
aVWell we think that insulin and IGF-1 hormones
p240
aVare hormones that are particularly active
p241
aVunder favorable conditions \u2014 in the good times \u2014
p242
aVwhen food is plentiful and there's not a lot of stress in the environment.
p243
aVThen they promote the uptake of nutrients.
p244
aVYou can store the food, use it for energy,
p245
aVgrow, etc.
p246
aa(lp247
VBut what we think is that, under conditions of stress,
p248
aVthe levels of these hormones drop \u2014
p249
aVfor example, having limited food supply.
p250
aVAnd that, we think,
p251
aVis registered by the animal as a danger signal,
p252
aVa signal that things are not okay
p253
aVand that it should roll out its protective capacity.
p254
aVSo it activates FOXO, FOXO goes to the DNA,
p255
aVand that triggers the expression of these genes
p256
aVthat improves the ability of the cell
p257
aVto protect itself and repair itself.
p258
aVAnd that's why we think the animals live longer.
p259
aa(lp260
VSo you can think of FOXO
p261
aVas being like a building superintendent.
p262
aVSo maybe he's a little bit lazy,
p263
aVbut he's there, he's taking care of the building.
p264
aVBut it's deteriorating.
p265
aVAnd then suddenly, he learns that there's going to be a hurricane.
p266
aVSo he doesn't actually do anything himself.
p267
aVHe gets on the telephone \u2014
p268
aVjust like FOXO gets on the DNA \u2014
p269
aVand he calls up
p270
aVthe roofer, the window person,
p271
aVthe painter, the floor person.
p272
aVAnd they all come and they fortify the house.
p273
aVAnd then the hurricane comes through,
p274
aVand the house is in much better condition than it would normally have been in.
p275
aVAnd not only that, it can also just last longer,
p276
aVeven if there isn't a hurricane.
p277
aVSo that's the concept here
p278
aVfor how we think this life extension ability exists.
p279
aa(lp280
VNow the really cool thing about FOXO
p281
aVis that there are different forms of it.
p282
aVWe all have FOXO genes,
p283
aVbut we don't all have exactly the same form of the FOXO gene.
p284
aVJust like we all have eyes,
p285
aVbut some of us have blue eyes and some of us have brown eyes.
p286
aVAnd there are certain forms of the FOXO gene
p287
aVthat have found to be more frequently present
p288
aVin people who live to be 90 or 100.
p289
aVAnd that's the case all over the world,
p290
aVas you can see from these stars.
p291
aVAnd each one of these stars represents a population
p292
aVwhere scientists have asked,
p293
aV"Okay, are there differences in the type of FOXO genes
p294
aVamong people who live a really long time?" and there are.
p295
aVWe don't know the details of how this works,
p296
aVbut we do know then
p297
aVthat FOXO genes can impact
p298
aVthe lifespan of people.
p299
aVAnd that means that, maybe if we tweak it a little bit,
p300
aVwe can increase the health and longevity of people.
p301
aa(lp302
VSo this is really exciting to me.
p303
aVA FOXO is a protein that we found in these little, round worms
p304
aVto affect lifespan,
p305
aVand here it affects lifespan in people.
p306
aVSo we've been trying in our lab now
p307
aVto develop drugs
p308
aVthat will activate this FOXO cell
p309
aVusing human cells now
p310
aVin order to try and come up with drugs
p311
aVthat will delay aging and age-related diseases.
p312
aVAnd I'm really optimistic that this is going to work.
p313
aa(lp314
VThere are lots of different proteins that are known to affect aging.
p315
aVAnd for at least one of them, there is a drug.
p316
aVThere's one called TOR, which is another nutrient sensor,
p317
aVlike the insulin pathway.
p318
aVAnd mutations that damage the TOR gene \u2014
p319
aVjust like the daf-2 mutations \u2014
p320
aVextend lifespan in worms
p321
aVand flies and mice.
p322
aVBut in this case, there's already a drug called rapamycin
p323
aVthat binds to the TOR protein
p324
aVand inhibits its activity.
p325
aVAnd you can take rapamycin and give it to a mouse \u2014
p326
aVeven when it's pretty old, like age 60 for a human,
p327
aVthat old for a mouse \u2014
p328
aVif you give the mouse rapamycin,
p329
aVit will live longer.
p330
aa(lp331
VNow I don't want you all to go out taking rapamycin.
p332
aVIt is a drug for people,
p333
aVbut the reason is it suppresses the immune system.
p334
aVSo people take it to prevent organ transplants from being rejected.
p335
aVSo this may not be the perfect drug
p336
aVfor staying young longer.
p337
aVBut still, here in the year 2011,
p338
aVthere's a drug that you can give to mice at a pretty old age
p339
aVthat will extend their lifespan,
p340
aVwhich comes out of this science
p341
aVthat's been done in all these different animals.
p342
aa(lp343
VSo I'm really optimistic,
p344
aVand I think it won't be too long, I hope,
p345
aVbefore this age-old dream begins to come true.
p346
aa(lp347
VThank you.
p348
aa(lp349
V(Applause)
p350
aa(lp351
VMatt Ridley: Thank you, Cynthia.
p352
aVLet me get this straight.
p353
aVAlthough you're looking for a drug
p354
aVthat can solve aging
p355
aVin old men like me,
p356
aVwhat you could do now pretty well in the lab,
p357
aVif you were allowed ethically,
p358
aVis start a human life from scratch
p359
aVwith altered genes that would make it live for a lot longer?
p360
aa(lp361
VCK: Ah, so the kinds of drugs I was talking about
p362
aVwould not change the genes,
p363
aVthey would just bind to the protein itself
p364
aVand change its activity.
p365
aVSo if you stop taking the drug, the protein would go back to normal.
p366
aVYou could change the genes in principle.
p367
aVThere isn't the technology to do that.
p368
aVBut I don't think that's a good idea.
p369
aVAnd the reason is
p370
aVthat these hormones,
p371
aVlike the insulin and the IGF hormones and the TOR pathway,
p372
aVthey're essential.
p373
aVIf you knock them out completely, then you're very sick.
p374
aVSo it might be that you would just have to fine tune it very carefully
p375
aVto get the benefits without getting any problems.
p376
aVAnd I think that's much better,
p377
aVthat kind of control would be much better as a drug.
p378
aVAnd also, there are other ways of activating FOXO
p379
aVthat don't even involve insulin or IGF-1
p380
aVthat might even be safer.
p381
aa(lp382
VMR: I wasn't suggesting that I was going to go and do it, but ...
p383
aV(Laughter)
p384
aVThere's a phenomenon which you have written about and spoken about,
p385
aVwhich is a negligible senescence.
p386
aVThere are some creatures on this planet already
p387
aVthat don't really do aging.
p388
aVJust move to one side for us, if you would.
p389
aa(lp390
VCK: There are. There are some animals that don't seem to age.
p391
aVFor example, there are some tortoises called Blanding's turtles.
p392
aVAnd they grow to be about this size.
p393
aVAnd they've been tagged, and they've been found to be 70 years old.
p394
aVAnd when you look at these 70 year-old turtles,
p395
aVyou can't tell the difference, just by looking,
p396
aVbetween those turtles and 20 year-old turtles.
p397
aVAnd the 70 year-old ones,
p398
aVactually they're better at scouting out the good nesting places,
p399
aVand they also have more progeny every year.
p400
aVAnd there are other examples of these kinds of animals,
p401
aVlike turns, certain kinds of birds are like this.
p402
aVAnd nobody knows if they really can live forever,
p403
aVor what keeps them from aging.
p404
aVIt's not clear.
p405
aa(lp406
VIf you look at birds, which live a long time,
p407
aVcells from the birds tend to be more resistant
p408
aVto a lot of different environmental stresses
p409
aVlike high temperature
p410
aVor hydrogen peroxide, things like that.
p411
aVAnd our long-lived mutants are too.
p412
aVThey're more resistant to these kinds of stresses.
p413
aVSo it could be that the pathways that I've been talking about,
p414
aVwhich are set to run really quickly in the worm,
p415
aVhave a different normal set point
p416
aVin something like a bird, so that a bird can live a lot longer.
p417
aVAnd maybe they're even set really differently
p418
aVin animals with no senescence at all \u2014 but we don't know.
p419
aa(lp420
VMR: But what you're talking about here
p421
aVis not extending human lifespan
p422
aVby preventing death,
p423
aVso much as extending human youthspan.
p424
aa(lp425
VCK: Yes, that's right.
p426
aVIt's more like, say, if you were a dog.
p427
aVYou notice that you're getting old, and you look at your human
p428
aVand you think, "Why isn't this human getting old?"
p429
aVThey're not getting old in the dog's lifespan.
p430
aVIt's more like that.
p431
aVBut now we're the human looking out and imagining a different human.
