VInterpreter: Piano, "p," is my favorite musical symbol.
p4
aVIt means to play softly.
p5
aVIf you're playing a musical instrument and you notice a "p" in the score,
p6
aVyou need to play softer.
p7
aVTwo p's \u2014 even softer.
p8
aVFour p's \u2014 extremely soft.
p9
aVThis is my drawing of a p-tree,
p10
aVwhich demonstrates
p11
aVno matter how many thousands upon thousands of p's there may be,
p12
aVyou'll never reach complete silence.
p13
aVThat's my current definition of silence:
p14
aVa very obscure sound.
p15
aa(lp16
VI'd like to share a little bit
p17
aVabout the history of American Sign Language, ASL,
p18
aVplus a bit of my own background.
p19
aVFrench sign language was brought to America during the early 1800s,
p20
aVand as time went by, mixed with local signs,
p21
aVit evolved into the language we know today as ASL.
p22
aVSo it has a history of about 200 years.
p23
aa(lp24
VI was born deaf,
p25
aVand I was taught to believe that sound wasn't a part of my life.
p26
aVAnd I believed it to be true.
p27
aVYet, I realize now that that wasn't the case at all.
p28
aVSound was very much a part of my life,
p29
aVreally, on my mind every day.
p30
aVAs a Deaf person living in a world of sound,
p31
aVit's as if I was living in a foreign country,
p32
aVblindly following its rules, customs, behaviors and norms
p33
aVwithout ever questioning them.
p34
aa(lp35
VSo how is it that I understand sound?
p36
aVWell, I watch how people behave and respond to sound.
p37
aVYou people are like my loudspeakers, and amplify sound.
p38
aVI learn and mirror that behavior.
p39
aVAt the same time, I've learned that I create sound,
p40
aVand I've seen how people respond to me.
p41
aVThus I've learned, for example ...
p42
aV"Don't slam the door!"
p43
aV"Don't make too much noise when you're eating from the potato-chip bag!"
p44
aa(lp45
V(Laughter)
p46
aa(lp47
V"Don't burp,
p48
aVand when you're eating,
p49
aVmake sure you don't scrape your utensils on the plate."
p50
aVAll of these things I term "sound etiquette."
p51
aVMaybe I think about sound etiquette
p52
aVmore than the average hearing person does.
p53
aVI'm hyper-vigilant around sound.
p54
aVAnd I'm always waiting in eager nervous anticipation
p55
aVaround sound, about what's to come next.
p56
aa(lp57
VHence, this drawing.
p58
aVTBD, to be decided.
p59
aVTBC, to be continued.
p60
aVTBA, to be announced.
p61
aVAnd you notice the staff \u2014
p62
aVthere are no notes contained in the lines.
p63
aVThat's because the lines already contain sound
p64
aVthrough the subtle smudges and smears.
p65
aa(lp66
VIn Deaf culture, movement is equivalent to sound.
p67
aVThis is a sign for "staff" in ASL.
p68
aVA typical staff contains five lines.
p69
aVYet for me, signing it with my thumb sticking up like that
p70
aVdoesn't feel natural.
p71
aVThat's why you'll notice in my drawings, I stick to four lines on paper.
p72
aa(lp73
VIn the year 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany,
p74
aVfor an artist residency there.
p75
aVPrior to this time, I had been working as a painter.
p76
aVDuring this summer, I visited different museums and gallery spaces,
p77
aVand as I went from one place to the next,
p78
aVI noticed there was no visual art there.
p79
aVAt that time, sound was trending, and this struck me ...
p80
aVthere was no visual art,
p81
aVeverything was auditory.
p82
aa(lp83
VNow sound has come into my art territory.
p84
aVIs it going to further distance me from art?
p85
aVI realized that doesn't have to be the case at all.
p86
aVI actually know sound.
p87
aVI know it so well
p88
aVthat it doesn't have to be something just experienced through the ears.
p89
aVIt could be felt tactually,
p90
aVor experienced as a visual,
p91
aVor even as an idea.
p92
aa(lp93
VSo I decided to reclaim ownership of sound
p94
aVand to put it into my art practice.
p95
aVAnd everything that I had been taught regarding sound,
p96
aVI decided to do away with and unlearn.
p97
aVI started creating a new body of work.
p98
aVAnd when I presented this to the art community,
p99
aVI was blown away with the amount of support and attention I received.
p100
aVI realized:
p101
aVsound is like money,
p102
aVpower, control \u2014
p103
aVsocial currency.
p104
aVIn the back of my mind, I've always felt that sound was your thing,
p105
aVa hearing person's thing.
p106
aVAnd sound is so powerful
p107
aVthat it could either disempower me and my artwork,
p108
aVor it could empower me.
p109
aVI chose to be empowered.
p110
aa(lp111
VThere's a massive culture around spoken language.
p112
aVAnd just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate,
p113
aVin society's eyes it's as if I don't have a voice at all.
p114
aVSo I need to work with individuals who can support me as an equal
p115
aVand become my voice.
p116
aVAnd that way, I'm able to maintain relevancy in society today.
p117
aa(lp118
VSo at school, at work and institutions,
p119
aVI work with many different ASL interpreters.
p120
aVAnd their voice becomes my voice and identity.
p121
aVThey help me to be heard.
p122
aVAnd their voices hold value and currency.
p123
aVIronically, by borrowing out their voices,
p124
aVI'm able to maintain a temporary form of currency,
p125
aVkind of like taking out a loan with a very high interest rate.
p126
aVIf I didn't continue this practice,
p127
aVI feel that I could just fade off into oblivion
p128
aVand not maintain any form of social currency.
p129
aa(lp130
VSo with sound as my new art medium,
p131
aVI delved into the world of music.
p132
aVAnd I was surprised to see the similarities between music and ASL.
p133
aVFor example,
p134
aVa musical note
p135
aVcannot be fully captured and expressed on paper.
p136
aVAnd the same holds true for a concept in ASL.
p137
aVThey're both highly spatial and highly inflected \u2014
p138
aVmeaning that subtle changes
p139
aVcan affect the entire meaning
p140
aVof both signs and sounds.
p141
aa(lp142
VI'd like to share with you a piano metaphor,
p143
aVto have you have a better understanding of how ASL works.
p144
aVSo, envision a piano.
p145
aVASL is broken down into many different grammatical parameters.
p146
aVIf you assign a different parameter to each finger as you play the piano \u2014
p147
aVsuch as facial expression, body movement,
p148
aVspeed, hand shape and so on,
p149
aVas you play the piano \u2014
p150
aVEnglish is a linear language,
p151
aVas if one key is being pressed at a time.
p152
aVHowever, ASL is more like a chord \u2014
p153
aVall 10 fingers need to come down simultaneously
p154
aVto express a clear concept or idea in ASL.
p155
aVIf just one of those keys were to change the chord,
p156
aVit would create a completely different meaning.
p157
aVThe same applies to music in regards to pitch, tone and volume.
p158
aVIn ASL, by playing around with these different grammatical parameters,
p159
aVyou can express different ideas.
p160
aa(lp161
VFor example, take the sign TO-LOOK-AT.
p162
aVThis is the sign TO-LOOK-AT.
p163
aVI'm looking at you.
p164
aVStaring at you.
p165
aa(lp166
V(Laughter)
p167
aa(lp168
V(Laughter)
p169
aa(lp170
VOh \u2014 busted.
p171
aa(lp172
V(Laughter)
p173
aa(lp174
VUh-oh.
p175
aVWhat are you looking at?
p176
aVAw, stop.
p177
aa(lp178
V(Laughter)
p179
aa(lp180
VI then started thinking,
p181
aV"What if I was to look at ASL through a musical lens?"
p182
aVIf I was to create a sign and repeat it over and over,
p183
aVit could become like a piece of visual music.
p184
aVFor example, this is the sign for "day,"
p185
aVas the sun rises and sets.
p186
aVThis is "all day."
p187
aVIf I was to repeat it and slow it down,
p188
aVvisually it looks like a piece of music.
p189
aVAll ... day.
p190
aVI feel the same holds true for "all night."
p191
aV"All night."
p192
aVThis is ALL-NIGHT, represented in this drawing.
p193
aVAnd this led me to thinking about three different kinds of nights:
p194
aV"last night,"
p195
aV"overnight,"
p196
aV(Sings) "all night long."
p197
aa(lp198
V(Laughter)
p199
aa(lp200
VI feel like the third one has a lot more musicality than the other two.
p201
aa(lp202
V(Laughter)
p203
aa(lp204
VThis represents how time is expressed in ASL
p205
aVand how the distance from your body can express the changes in time.
p206
aVFor example,
p207
aV1H is one hand, 2H is two hand,
p208
aVpresent tense happens closest and in front of the body,
p209
aVfuture is in front of the body and the past is to your back.
p210
aVSo, the first example is "a long time ago."
p211
aVThen "past,"
p212
aV"used to"
p213
aVand the last one, which is my favorite,
p214
aVwith the very romantic and dramatic notion to it,
p215
aV"once upon a time."
p216
aa(lp217
V(Laughter)
p218
aa(lp219
V"Common time"
p220
aVis a musical term
p221
aVwith a specific time signature of four beats per measure.
p222
aVYet when I see the word "common time,"
p223
aVwhat automatically comes to mind for me is "at the same time."
p224
aVSo notice RH: right hand, LH: left hand.
p225
aVWe have the staff across the head and the chest.
p226
aa(lp227
V[Head: RH, Flash claw]
p228
aa(lp229
V[Common time]
p230
aa(lp231
V[Chest: LH, Flash claw]
p232
aa(lp233
VI'm now going to demonstrate a hand shape called the "flash claw."
p234
aVCan you please follow along with me?
p235
aVEverybody, hands up.
p236
aVNow we're going to do it in both the head and the chest,
p237
aVkind of like "common time" or at the same time.
p238
aVYes, got it.
p239
aVThat means "to fall in love" in International [Sign].
p240
aa(lp241
V(Laughter)
p242
aa(lp243
VInternational [Sign], as a note,
p244
aVis a visual tool to help communicate
p245
aVacross cultures and sign languages around the world.
p246
aa(lp247
VThe second one I'd like to demonstrate is this \u2014
p248
aVplease follow along with me again.
p249
aVAnd now this.
p250
aVThis is "colonization" in ASL.
p251
aa(lp252
V(Laughter)
p253
aa(lp254
VNow the third \u2014
p255
aVplease follow along again.
p256
aVAnd again.
p257
aVThis is "enlightenment" in ASL.
p258
aVSo let's do all three together.
p259
aV"Fall in love,"
p260
aV"colonization"
p261
aVand "enlightenment."
p262
aVGood job, everyone.
p263
aa(lp264
V(Laughter)
p265
aa(lp266
VNotice how all three signs are very similar,
p267
aVthey all happen at the head and the chest,
p268
aVbut they convey quite different meanings.
p269
aa(lp270
VSo it's amazing to see how ASL is alive and thriving,
p271
aVjust like music is.
p272
aVHowever, in this day and age,
p273
aVwe live in a very audio-centric world.
p274
aVAnd just because ASL has no sound to it,
p275
aVit automatically holds no social currency.
p276
aVWe need to start thinking harder about what defines social currency
p277
aVand allow ASL to develop its own form of currency \u2014
p278
aVwithout sound.
p279
aVAnd this could possibly be a step to lead to a more inclusive society.
p280
aVAnd maybe people will understand
p281
aVthat you don't need to be deaf to learn ASL,
p282
aVnor do you have to be hearing to learn music.
p283
aa(lp284
VASL is such a rich treasure
p285
aVthat I'd like you to have the same experience.
p286
aVAnd I'd like to invite you to open your ears,
p287
aVto open your eyes,
p288
aVtake part in our culture
p289
aVand experience our visual language.
p290
aVAnd you never know,
p291
aVyou might just fall in love with us.
p292
aa(lp293
V(Applause)
p294
aa(lp295
VThank you.
