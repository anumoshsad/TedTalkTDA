VSo I'd like you to imagine for a moment
p4
aVthat you're a soldier in the heat of battle.
p5
aVMaybe you're a Roman foot soldier or a medieval archer
p6
aVor maybe you're a Zulu warrior.
p7
aVRegardless of your time and place, there are some things that are constant.
p8
aVYour adrenaline is elevated,
p9
aVand your actions are stemming from these deeply ingrained reflexes,
p10
aVreflexes rooted in a need to protect yourself and your side
p11
aVand to defeat the enemy.
p12
aa(lp13
VSo now, I'd like you to imagine playing a very different role,
p14
aVthat of the scout.
p15
aVThe scout's job is not to attack or defend.
p16
aVThe scout's job is to understand.
p17
aVThe scout is the one going out,
p18
aVmapping the terrain, identifying potential obstacles.
p19
aVAnd the scout may hope to learn that, say, there's a bridge
p20
aVin a convenient location across a river.
p21
aVBut above all, the scout wants to know what's really there,
p22
aVas accurately as possible.
p23
aVAnd in a real, actual army, both the soldier and the scout are essential.
p24
aVBut you can also think of each of these roles as a mindset \u2014
p25
aVa metaphor for how all of us process information and ideas
p26
aVin our daily lives.
p27
aVWhat I'm going to argue today is that having good judgment,
p28
aVmaking accurate predictions, making good decisions,
p29
aVis mostly about which mindset you're in.
p30
aa(lp31
VTo illustrate these mindsets in action,
p32
aVI'm going to take you back to 19th-century France,
p33
aVwhere this innocuous-looking piece of paper
p34
aVlaunched one of the biggest political scandals in history.
p35
aVIt was discovered in 1894 by officers in the French general staff.
p36
aVIt was torn up in a wastepaper basket,
p37
aVbut when they pieced it back together,
p38
aVthey discovered that someone in their ranks
p39
aVhad been selling military secrets to Germany.
p40
aa(lp41
VSo they launched a big investigation,
p42
aVand their suspicions quickly converged on this man,
p43
aVAlfred Dreyfus.
p44
aVHe had a sterling record,
p45
aVno past history of wrongdoing, no motive as far as they could tell.
p46
aVBut Dreyfus was the only Jewish officer at that rank in the army,
p47
aVand unfortunately at this time, the French Army was highly anti-Semitic.
p48
aVThey compared Dreyfus's handwriting to that on the memo
p49
aVand concluded that it was a match,
p50
aVeven though outside professional handwriting experts
p51
aVwere much less confident in the similarity,
p52
aVbut never mind that.
p53
aVThey went and searched Dreyfus's apartment,
p54
aVlooking for any signs of espionage.
p55
aVThey went through his files, and they didn't find anything.
p56
aVThis just convinced them more that Dreyfus was not only guilty,
p57
aVbut sneaky as well, because clearly he had hidden all of the evidence
p58
aVbefore they had managed to get to it.
p59
aa(lp60
VNext, they went and looked through his personal history
p61
aVfor any incriminating details.
p62
aVThey talked to his teachers,
p63
aVthey found that he had studied foreign languages in school,
p64
aVwhich clearly showed a desire to conspire with foreign governments
p65
aVlater in life.
p66
aVHis teachers also said that Dreyfus was known for having a good memory,
p67
aVwhich was highly suspicious, right?
p68
aVYou know, because a spy has to remember a lot of things.
p69
aa(lp70
VSo the case went to trial, and Dreyfus was found guilty.
p71
aVAfterwards, they took him out into this public square
p72
aVand ritualistically tore his insignia from his uniform
p73
aVand broke his sword in two.
p74
aVThis was called the Degradation of Dreyfus.
p75
aVAnd they sentenced him to life imprisonment
p76
aVon the aptly named Devil's Island,
p77
aVwhich is this barren rock off the coast of South America.
p78
aVSo there he went, and there he spent his days alone,
p79
aVwriting letters and letters to the French government
p80
aVbegging them to reopen his case so they could discover his innocence.
p81
aVBut for the most part, France considered the matter closed.
p82
aa(lp83
VOne thing that's really interesting to me about the Dreyfus Affair
p84
aVis this question of why the officers were so convinced
p85
aVthat Dreyfus was guilty.
p86
aVI mean, you might even assume that they were setting him up,
p87
aVthat they were intentionally framing him.
p88
aVBut historians don't think that's what happened.
p89
aVAs far as we can tell,
p90
aVthe officers genuinely believed that the case against Dreyfus was strong.
p91
aVWhich makes you wonder:
p92
aVWhat does it say about the human mind
p93
aVthat we can find such paltry evidence
p94
aVto be compelling enough to convict a man?
p95
aa(lp96
VWell, this is a case of what scientists call "motivated reasoning."
p97
aVIt's this phenomenon in which our unconscious motivations,
p98
aVour desires and fears,
p99
aVshape the way we interpret information.
p100
aVSome information, some ideas, feel like our allies.
p101
aVWe want them to win. We want to defend them.
p102
aVAnd other information or ideas are the enemy,
p103
aVand we want to shoot them down.
p104
aVSo this is why I call motivated reasoning, "soldier mindset."
p105
aa(lp106
VProbably most of you have never persecuted
p107
aVa French-Jewish officer for high treason,
p108
aVI assume,
p109
aVbut maybe you've followed sports or politics, so you might have noticed
p110
aVthat when the referee judges that your team committed a foul,
p111
aVfor example,
p112
aVyou're highly motivated to find reasons why he's wrong.
p113
aVBut if he judges that the other team committed a foul \u2014 awesome!
p114
aVThat's a good call, let's not examine it too closely.
p115
aVOr, maybe you've read an article or a study
p116
aVthat examined some controversial policy,
p117
aVlike capital punishment.
p118
aVAnd, as researchers have demonstrated,
p119
aVif you support capital punishment
p120
aVand the study shows that it's not effective,
p121
aVthen you're highly motivated to find all the reasons
p122
aVwhy the study was poorly designed.
p123
aVBut if it shows that capital punishment works,
p124
aVit's a good study.
p125
aVAnd vice versa: if you don't support capital punishment, same thing.
p126
aa(lp127
VOur judgment is strongly influenced, unconsciously,
p128
aVby which side we want to win.
p129
aVAnd this is ubiquitous.
p130
aVThis shapes how we think about our health, our relationships,
p131
aVhow we decide how to vote,
p132
aVwhat we consider fair or ethical.
p133
aVWhat's most scary to me about motivated reasoning
p134
aVor soldier mindset,
p135
aVis how unconscious it is.
p136
aVWe can think we're being objective and fair-minded
p137
aVand still wind up ruining the life of an innocent man.
p138
aa(lp139
VHowever, fortunately for Dreyfus, his story is not over.
p140
aVThis is Colonel Picquart.
p141
aVHe's another high-ranking officer in the French Army,
p142
aVand like most people, he assumed Dreyfus was guilty.
p143
aVAlso like most people in the army, he was at least casually anti-Semitic.
p144
aVBut at a certain point, Picquart began to suspect:
p145
aV"What if we're all wrong about Dreyfus?"
p146
aVWhat happened was, he had discovered evidence
p147
aVthat the spying for Germany had continued,
p148
aVeven after Dreyfus was in prison.
p149
aVAnd he had also discovered that another officer in the army
p150
aVhad handwriting that perfectly matched the memo,
p151
aVmuch closer than Dreyfus's handwriting.
p152
aVSo he brought these discoveries to his superiors,
p153
aVbut to his dismay, they either didn't care
p154
aVor came up with elaborate rationalizations to explain his findings,
p155
aVlike, "Well, all you've really shown, Picquart, is that there's another spy
p156
aVwho learned how to mimic Dreyfus's handwriting,
p157
aVand he picked up the torch of spying after Dreyfus left.
p158
aVBut Dreyfus is still guilty."
p159
aVEventually, Picquart managed to get Dreyfus exonerated.
p160
aVBut it took him 10 years,
p161
aVand for part of that time, he himself was in prison
p162
aVfor the crime of disloyalty to the army.
p163
aa(lp164
VA lot of people feel like Picquart can't really be the hero of this story
p165
aVbecause he was an anti-Semite and that's bad, which I agree with.
p166
aVBut personally, for me, the fact that Picquart was anti-Semitic
p167
aVactually makes his actions more admirable,
p168
aVbecause he had the same prejudices, the same reasons to be biased
p169
aVas his fellow officers,
p170
aVbut his motivation to find the truth and uphold it trumped all of that.
p171
aa(lp172
VSo to me,
p173
aVPicquart is a poster child for what I call "scout mindset."
p174
aVIt's the drive not to make one idea win or another lose,
p175
aVbut just to see what's really there
p176
aVas honestly and accurately as you can,
p177
aVeven if it's not pretty or convenient or pleasant.
p178
aVThis mindset is what I'm personally passionate about.
p179
aVAnd I've spent the last few years examining and trying to figure out
p180
aVwhat causes scout mindset.
p181
aVWhy are some people, sometimes at least,
p182
aVable to cut through their own prejudices and biases and motivations
p183
aVand just try to see the facts and the evidence
p184
aVas objectively as they can?
p185
aa(lp186
VAnd the answer is emotional.
p187
aVSo, just as soldier mindset is rooted in emotions
p188
aVlike defensiveness or tribalism,
p189
aVscout mindset is, too.
p190
aVIt's just rooted in different emotions.
p191
aVFor example, scouts are curious.
p192
aVThey're more likely to say they feel pleasure
p193
aVwhen they learn new information
p194
aVor an itch to solve a puzzle.
p195
aVThey're more likely to feel intrigued when they encounter something
p196
aVthat contradicts their expectations.
p197
aVScouts also have different values.
p198
aVThey're more likely to say they think it's virtuous
p199
aVto test your own beliefs,
p200
aVand they're less likely to say that someone who changes his mind
p201
aVseems weak.
p202
aVAnd above all, scouts are grounded,
p203
aVwhich means their self-worth as a person
p204
aVisn't tied to how right or wrong they are about any particular topic.
p205
aVSo they can believe that capital punishment works.
p206
aVIf studies come out showing that it doesn't, they can say,
p207
aV"Huh. Looks like I might be wrong. Doesn't mean I'm bad or stupid."
p208
aa(lp209
VThis cluster of traits is what researchers have found \u2014
p210
aVand I've also found anecdotally \u2014
p211
aVpredicts good judgment.
p212
aVAnd the key takeaway I want to leave you with about those traits
p213
aVis that they're primarily not about how smart you are
p214
aVor about how much you know.
p215
aVIn fact, they don't correlate very much with IQ at all.
p216
aVThey're about how you feel.
p217
aVThere's a quote that I keep coming back to, by Saint-Exupéry.
p218
aVHe's the author of "The Little Prince."
p219
aVHe said, "If you want to build a ship,
p220
aVdon't drum up your men to collect wood and give orders
p221
aVand distribute the work.
p222
aVInstead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea."
p223
aa(lp224
VIn other words, I claim,
p225
aVif we really want to improve our judgment as individuals
p226
aVand as societies,
p227
aVwhat we need most is not more instruction in logic
p228
aVor rhetoric or probability or economics,
p229
aVeven though those things are quite valuable.
p230
aVBut what we most need to use those principles well
p231
aVis scout mindset.
p232
aVWe need to change the way we feel.
p233
aVWe need to learn how to feel proud instead of ashamed
p234
aVwhen we notice we might have been wrong about something.
p235
aVWe need to learn how to feel intrigued instead of defensive
p236
aVwhen we encounter some information that contradicts our beliefs.
p237
aa(lp238
VSo the question I want to leave you with is:
p239
aVWhat do you most yearn for?
p240
aVDo you yearn to defend your own beliefs?
p241
aVOr do you yearn to see the world as clearly as you possibly can?
p242
aa(lp243
VThank you.
