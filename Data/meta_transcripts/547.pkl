VBelieve me or not, I come offering a solution
p4
aVto a very important part of this larger problem,
p5
aVwith the requisite focus on climate.
p6
aVAnd the solution I offer
p7
aVis to the biggest culprit
p8
aVin this massive mistreatment of the earth
p9
aVby humankind,
p10
aVand the resulting decline of the biosphere.
p11
aVThat culprit is business and industry,
p12
aVwhich happens to be where I have spent the last 52 years
p13
aVsince my graduation from Georgia Tech in 1956.
p14
aVAs an industrial engineer,
p15
aVcum aspiring and then successful entrepreneur.
p16
aVAfter founding my company, Interface, from scratch
p17
aVin 1973, 36 years ago,
p18
aVto produce carpet tiles in America
p19
aVfor the business and institution markets,
p20
aVand shepherding it through start-up and survival
p21
aVto prosperity and global dominance in its field,
p22
aVI read Paul Hawken's book,
p23
aV"The Ecology of Commerce,"
p24
aVthe summer of 1994.
p25
aVIn his book, Paul charges business and industry
p26
aVas, one, the major culprit
p27
aVin causing the decline of the biosphere,
p28
aVand, two, the only institution that is large enough,
p29
aVand pervasive enough, and powerful enough,
p30
aVto really lead humankind out of this mess.
p31
aVAnd by the way he convicted me
p32
aVas a plunderer of the earth.
p33
aa(lp34
VAnd I then challenged the people of Interface, my company,
p35
aVto lead our company and the entire industrial world to sustainability,
p36
aVwhich we defined as eventually operating
p37
aVour petroleum-intensive company in such a way
p38
aVas to take from the earth
p39
aVonly what can be renewed by the earth, naturally and rapidly \u2014
p40
aVnot another fresh drop of oil \u2014
p41
aVand to do no harm to the biosphere.
p42
aVTake nothing: do no harm.
p43
aVI simply said, "If Hawken is right
p44
aVand business and industry must lead,
p45
aVwho will lead business and industry?
p46
aVUnless somebody leads, nobody will."
p47
aVIt's axiomatic. Why not us?
p48
aVAnd thanks to the people of Interface,
p49
aVI have become a recovering plunderer.
p50
aa(lp51
V(Laughter)

p54
aa(lp55
VI once told a Fortune Magazine writer
p56
aVthat someday people like me would go to jail.
p57
aVAnd that became the headline of a Fortune article.
p58
aVThey went on to describe me as America's greenest CEO.
p59
aVFrom plunderer to recovering plunderer,
p60
aVto America's greenest CEO in five years \u2014
p61
aVthat, frankly, was a pretty sad commentary
p62
aVon American CEOs in 1999.
p63
aVAsked later in the Canadian documentary, "The Corporation,"
p64
aVwhat I meant by the "go to jail" remark,
p65
aVI offered that theft is a crime.
p66
aVAnd theft of our children's future would someday be a crime.
p67
aVBut I realized, for that to be true \u2014
p68
aVfor theft of our children's future to be a crime \u2014
p69
aVthere must be a clear, demonstrable alternative
p70
aVto the take-make-waste industrial system
p71
aVthat so dominates our civilization,
p72
aVand is the major culprit, stealing our children's future,
p73
aVby digging up the earth
p74
aVand converting it to products that quickly become waste
p75
aVin a landfill or an incinerator \u2014
p76
aVin short, digging up the earth and converting it to pollution.
p77
aa(lp78
VAccording to Paul and Anne Ehrlich
p79
aVand a well-known environmental impact equation,
p80
aVimpact \u2014 a bad thing \u2014
p81
aVis the product of population, affluence and technology.
p82
aVThat is, impact is generated by people,
p83
aVwhat they consume in their affluence,
p84
aVand how it is produced.
p85
aVAnd though the equation is largely subjective,
p86
aVyou can perhaps quantify people, and perhaps quantify affluence,
p87
aVbut technology is abusive in too many ways to quantify.
p88
aVSo the equation is conceptual.
p89
aVStill it works to help us understand the problem.
p90
aa(lp91
VSo we set out at Interface, in 1994,
p92
aVto create an example:
p93
aVto transform the way we made carpet,
p94
aVa petroleum-intensive product for materials as well as energy,
p95
aVand to transform our technologies
p96
aVso they diminished environmental impact,
p97
aVrather than multiplied it.
p98
aVPaul and Anne Ehrlich's environmental impact equation:
p99
aVI is equal to P times A times T:
p100
aVpopulation, affluence and technology.
p101
aVI wanted Interface to rewrite that equation so that it read
p102
aVI equals P times A divided by T.
p103
aVNow, the mathematically-minded will see immediately
p104
aVthat T in the numerator increases impact \u2014 a bad thing \u2014
p105
aVbut T in the denominator decreases impact.
p106
aVSo I ask, "What would move T, technology,
p107
aVfrom the numerator \u2014 call it T1 \u2014
p108
aVwhere it increases impact,
p109
aVto the denominator \u2014 call it T2 \u2014
p110
aVwhere it reduces impact?
p111
aa(lp112
VI thought about the characteristics
p113
aVof first industrial revolution,
p114
aVT1, as we practiced it at Interface,
p115
aVand it had the following characteristics.
p116
aVExtractive: taking raw materials from the earth.
p117
aVLinear: take, make, waste.
p118
aVPowered by fossil fuel-derived energy.
p119
aVWasteful: abusive and focused on labor productivity.
p120
aVMore carpet per man-hour.
p121
aVThinking it through, I realized that all those attributes
p122
aVmust be changed to move T to the denominator.
p123
aVIn the new industrial revolution extractive must be replaced by renewable;
p124
aVlinear by cyclical;
p125
aVfossil fuel energy by renewable energy, sunlight;
p126
aVwasteful by waste-free;
p127
aVand abusive by benign;
p128
aVand labor productivity by resource productivity.
p129
aVAnd I reasoned that if we could make those transformative changes,
p130
aVand get rid of T1 altogether,
p131
aVwe could reduce our impact to zero,
p132
aVincluding our impact on the climate.
p133
aVAnd that became the Interface plan in 1995,
p134
aVand has been the plan ever since.
p135
aa(lp136
VWe have measured our progress very rigorously.
p137
aVSo I can tell you how far we have come in the ensuing 12 years.
p138
aVNet greenhouse gas emissions
p139
aVdown 82 percent in absolute tonnage.
p140
aV(Applause)
p141
aVOver the same span of time
p142
aVsales have increased by two-thirds and profits have doubled.
p143
aVSo an 82 percent absolute reduction
p144
aVtranslates into a 90 percent reduction
p145
aVin greenhouse gas intensity relative to sales.
p146
aVThis is the magnitude
p147
aVof the reduction the entire global technosphere
p148
aVmust realize by 2050
p149
aVto avoid catastrophic climate disruption \u2014
p150
aVso the scientists are telling us.
p151
aVFossil fuel usage is down 60 percent per unit of production,
p152
aVdue to efficiencies in renewables.
p153
aVThe cheapest, most secure barrel of oil there is
p154
aVis the one not used through efficiencies.
p155
aVWater usage is down 75 percent
p156
aVin our worldwide carpet tile business.
p157
aVDown 40 percent in our broadloom carpet business,
p158
aVwhich we acquired in 1993
p159
aVright here in California, City of Industry,
p160
aVwhere water is so precious.
p161
aVRenewable or recyclable materials are 25 percent of the total, and growing rapidly.
p162
aVRenewable energy is 27 percent of our total,
p163
aVgoing for 100 percent.
p164
aVWe have diverted 148 million pounds \u2014
p165
aVthat's 74,000 tons \u2014
p166
aVof used carpet from landfills,
p167
aVclosing the loop on material flows
p168
aVthrough reverse logistics
p169
aVand post-consumer recycling technologies
p170
aVthat did not exist when we started 14 years ago.
p171
aa(lp172
VThose new cyclical technologies
p173
aVhave contributed mightily to the fact that we have produced and sold
p174
aV85 million square yards of climate-neutral carpet
p175
aVsince 2004,
p176
aVmeaning no net contribution to global climate disruption
p177
aVin producing the carpet throughout the supply chain,
p178
aVfrom mine and well head clear to end-of-life reclamation \u2014
p179
aVindependent third-party certified.
p180
aVWe call it Cool Carpet.
p181
aVAnd it has been a powerful marketplace differentiator,
p182
aVincreasing sales and profits.
p183
aVThree years ago we launched carpet tile for the home,
p184
aVunder the brand Flor,
p185
aVmisspelled F-L-O-R.
p186
aVYou can point and click today at Flor.com
p187
aVand have Cool Carpet delivered to your front door in five days.
p188
aVIt is practical, and pretty too.
p189
aa(lp190
V(Laughter)
p191
aa(lp192
V(Applause)
p193
aa(lp194
VWe reckon that we are a bit over halfway
p195
aVto our goal: zero impact, zero footprint.
p196
aVWe've set 2020 as our target year for zero,
p197
aVfor reaching the top, the summit of Mount Sustainability.
p198
aVWe call this Mission Zero.
p199
aVAnd this is perhaps the most important facet:
p200
aVwe have found Mission Zero to be incredibly good for business.
p201
aVA better business model,
p202
aVa better way to bigger profits.
p203
aVHere is the business case for sustainability.
p204
aVFrom real life experience, costs are down, not up,
p205
aVreflecting some 400 million dollars
p206
aVof avoided costs in pursuit of zero waste \u2014
p207
aVthe first face of Mount Sustainability.
p208
aVThis has paid all the costs for the transformation of Interface.
p209
aa(lp210
VAnd this dispels a myth too,
p211
aVthis false choice between the environment and the economy.
p212
aVOur products are the best they've ever been,
p213
aVinspired by design for sustainability,
p214
aVan unexpected wellspring of innovation.
p215
aVOur people are galvanized around this shared higher purpose.
p216
aVYou cannot beat it for attracting the best people
p217
aVand bringing them together.
p218
aVAnd the goodwill of the marketplace is astonishing.
p219
aVNo amount of advertising, no clever marketing campaign,
p220
aVat any price, could have produced or created
p221
aVthis much goodwill.
p222
aVCosts, products, people, marketplaces \u2014
p223
aVwhat else is there?
p224
aVIt is a better business model.
p225
aa(lp226
VAnd here is our 14-year record of sales and profits.
p227
aVThere is a dip there, from 2001 to 2003:
p228
aVa dip when our sales, over a three-year period,
p229
aVwere down 17 percent.
p230
aVBut the marketplace was down 36 percent.
p231
aVWe literally gained market share.
p232
aVWe might not have survived that recession
p233
aVbut for the advantages of sustainability.
p234
aVIf every business were pursuing Interface plans,
p235
aVwould that solve all our problems?
p236
aVI don't think so.
p237
aVI remain troubled by the revised Ehrlich equation,
p238
aVI equals P times A divided by T2.
p239
aVThat A is a capital A,
p240
aVsuggesting that affluence is an end in itself.
p241
aVBut what if we reframed Ehrlich further?
p242
aVAnd what if we made A a lowercase 'a,'
p243
aVsuggesting that it is a means to an end,
p244
aVand that end is happiness \u2014
p245
aVmore happiness with less stuff.
p246
aa(lp247
VYou know that would reframe civilization itself \u2014
p248
aV(Applause) \u2014
p249
aVand our whole system of economics,
p250
aVif not for our species, then perhaps for the one that succeeds us:
p251
aVthe sustainable species, living on a finite earth,
p252
aVethically, happily and ecologically
p253
aVin balance with nature
p254
aVand all her natural systems for a thousand generations,
p255
aVor 10,000 generations \u2014
p256
aVthat is to say, into the indefinite future.
p257
aVBut does the earth have to wait for our extinction as a species?
p258
aVWell maybe so. But I don't think so.
p259
aa(lp260
VAt Interface we really intend to bring this prototypical
p261
aVsustainable, zero-footprint industrial company
p262
aVfully into existence by 2020.
p263
aVWe can see our way now,
p264
aVclear to the top of that mountain.
p265
aVAnd now the challenge is in execution.
p266
aVAnd as my good friend and adviser Amory Lovins says,
p267
aV"If something exists, it must be possible."
p268
aV(Laughter)
p269
aVIf we can actually do it, it must be possible.
p270
aVIf we, a petro-intensive company can do it, anybody can.
p271
aVAnd if anybody can, it follows that everybody can.
p272
aa(lp273
VHawken fulfilled business and industry,
p274
aVleading humankind away from the abyss
p275
aVbecause, with continued unchecked decline of the biosphere,
p276
aVa very dear person is at risk here \u2014
p277
aVfrankly, an unacceptable risk.
p278
aVWho is that person?
p279
aVNot you. Not I.
p280
aVBut let me introduce you to the one who is most at risk here.
p281
aVAnd I myself met this person in the early days of this mountain climb.
p282
aVOn a Tuesday morning in March of 1996,
p283
aVI was talking to people, as I did at every opportunity back then,
p284
aVbringing them along and often not knowing whether I was connecting.
p285
aVBut about five days later back in Atlanta,
p286
aVI received an email from Glenn Thomas,
p287
aVone of my people in the California meeting.
p288
aVHe was sending me an original poem
p289
aVthat he had composed after our Tuesday morning together.
p290
aVAnd when I read it it was one of the most uplifting moments of my life.
p291
aVBecause it told me, by God, one person got it.
p292
aVHere is what Glenn wrote. And here is that person, most at risk.
p293
aVPlease meet "Tomorrow's Child."
p294
aa(lp295
V"Without a name, an unseen face, and knowing not your time or place,
p296
aa(lp297
VTomorrow's child, though yet unborn,
p298
aVI met you first last Tuesday morn.
p299
aa(lp300
VA wise friend introduced us two.
p301
aVAnd through his sobering point of view
p302
aa(lp303
VI saw a day that you would see, a day for you but not for me.
p304
aa(lp305
VKnowing you has changed my thinking.
p306
aVFor I never had an inkling
p307
aa(lp308
Vthat perhaps the things I do might someday,
p309
aVsomehow threaten you.
p310
aa(lp311
VTomorrow's child, my daughter, son,
p312
aa(lp313
VI'm afraid I've just begun to think of you and of your good,
p314
aa(lp315
Vthough always having known I should.
p316
aa(lp317
VBegin, I will.
p318
aa(lp319
VThe way the cost of what I squander, what is lost,
p320
aa(lp321
Vif ever I forget that you
p322
aVwill someday come and live here too."
p323
aa(lp324
VWell, every day of my life since,
p325
aV"Tomorrow's Child" has spoken to me
p326
aVwith one simple but profound message,
p327
aVwhich I presume to share with you.
p328
aVWe are, each and every one,
p329
aVa part of the web of life.
p330
aVThe continuum of humanity, sure, but in a larger sense, the web of life itself.
p331
aVAnd we have a choice to make
p332
aVduring our brief, brief visit
p333
aVto this beautiful blue and green living planet:
p334
aVto hurt it or to help it.
p335
aVFor you, it's your call.
p336
