VThis story starts with these two \u2014
p4
aVmy kids.
p5
aVWe were hiking in the Oakland woods
p6
aVwhen my daughter noticed a plastic tub of cat litter in a creek.
p7
aVShe looked at me and said,
p8
aV"Daddy?
p9
aVThat doesn't go there."
p10
aa(lp11
VWhen she said that, it reminded me of summer camp.
p12
aVOn the morning of visiting day,
p13
aVright before they'd let our anxious parents come barreling through the gates,
p14
aVour camp director would say,
p15
aV"Quick! Everyone pick up five pieces of litter."
p16
aVYou get a couple hundred kids each picking up five pieces,
p17
aVand pretty soon, you've got a much cleaner camp.
p18
aVSo I thought,
p19
aVwhy not apply that crowdsourced cleanup model to the entire planet?
p20
aVAnd that was the inspiration for Litterati.
p21
aa(lp22
VThe vision is to create a litter-free world.
p23
aVLet me show you how it started.
p24
aVI took a picture of a cigarette using Instagram.
p25
aVThen I took another photo ...
p26
aVand another photo ...
p27
aVand another photo.
p28
aVAnd I noticed two things:
p29
aVone, litter became artistic and approachable;
p30
aVand two,
p31
aVat the end of a few days, I had 50 photos on my phone
p32
aVand I had picked up each piece,
p33
aVand I realized that I was keeping a record
p34
aVof the positive impact I was having on the planet.
p35
aVThat's 50 less things that you might see,
p36
aVor you might step on,
p37
aVor some bird might eat.
p38
aa(lp39
VSo I started telling people what I was doing,
p40
aVand they started participating.
p41
aVOne day,
p42
aVthis photo showed up from China.
p43
aVAnd that's when I realized
p44
aVthat Litterati was more than just pretty pictures;
p45
aVwe were becoming a community that was collecting data.
p46
aVEach photo tells a story.
p47
aVIt tells us who picked up what,
p48
aVa geotag tells us where
p49
aVand a time stamp tells us when.
p50
aVSo I built a Google map,
p51
aVand started plotting the points where pieces were being picked up.
p52
aVAnd through that process, the community grew
p53
aVand the data grew.
p54
aVMy two kids go to school right in that bullseye.
p55
aa(lp56
VLitter:
p57
aVit's blending into the background of our lives.
p58
aVBut what if we brought it to the forefront?
p59
aVWhat if we understood exactly what was on our streets,
p60
aVour sidewalks
p61
aVand our school yards?
p62
aVHow might we use that data to make a difference?
p63
aa(lp64
VWell, let me show you.
p65
aVThe first is with cities.
p66
aVSan Francisco wanted to understand what percentage of litter was cigarettes.
p67
aVWhy?
p68
aVTo create a tax.
p69
aVSo they put a couple of people in the streets
p70
aVwith pencils and clipboards,
p71
aVwho walked around collecting information
p72
aVwhich led to a 20-cent tax on all cigarette sales.
p73
aVAnd then they got sued
p74
aVby big tobacco,
p75
aVwho claimed that collecting information with pencils and clipboards
p76
aVis neither precise nor provable.
p77
aVThe city called me and asked if our technology could help.
p78
aVI'm not sure they realized
p79
aVthat our technology was my Instagram account \u2014
p80
aa(lp81
V(Laughter)
p82
aa(lp83
VBut I said, "Yes, we can."
p84
aa(lp85
V(Laughter)
p86
aa(lp87
V"And we can tell you if that's a Parliament or a Pall Mall.
p88
aVPlus, every photograph is geotagged and time-stamped,
p89
aVproviding you with proof."
p90
aVFour days and 5,000 pieces later,
p91
aVour data was used in court to not only defend but double the tax,
p92
aVgenerating an annual recurring revenue of four million dollars
p93
aVfor San Francisco to clean itself up.
p94
aa(lp95
VNow, during that process I learned two things:
p96
aVone, Instagram is not the right tool \u2014
p97
aa(lp98
V(Laughter)
p99
aa(lp100
Vso we built an app.
p101
aa(lp102
VAnd two, if you think about it,
p103
aVevery city in the world has a unique litter fingerprint,
p104
aVand that fingerprint provides both the source of the problem
p105
aVand the path to the solution.
p106
aVIf you could generate a revenue stream
p107
aVjust by understanding the percentage of cigarettes,
p108
aVwell, what about coffee cups
p109
aVor soda cans
p110
aVor plastic bottles?
p111
aVIf you could fingerprint San Francisco, well, how about Oakland
p112
aVor Amsterdam
p113
aVor somewhere much closer to home?
p114
aVAnd what about brands?
p115
aVHow might they use this data
p116
aVto align their environmental and economic interests?
p117
aa(lp118
VThere's a block in downtown Oakland that's covered in blight.
p119
aVThe Litterati community got together and picked up 1,500 pieces.
p120
aVAnd here's what we learned:
p121
aVmost of that litter came from a very well-known taco brand.
p122
aVMost of that brand's litter were their own hot sauce packets,
p123
aVand most of those hot sauce packets hadn't even been opened.
p124
aVThe problem and the path to the solution \u2014
p125
aVwell, maybe that brand only gives out hot sauce upon request
p126
aVor installs bulk dispensers
p127
aVor comes up with more sustainable packaging.
p128
aVHow does a brand take an environmental hazard,
p129
aVturn it into an economic engine
p130
aVand become an industry hero?
p131
aa(lp132
VIf you really want to create change,
p133
aVthere's no better place to start than with our kids.
p134
aVA group of fifth graders picked up 1,247 pieces of litter
p135
aVjust on their school yard.
p136
aVAnd they learned that the most common type of litter
p137
aVwere the plastic straw wrappers from their own cafeteria.
p138
aVSo these kids went to their principal and asked,
p139
aV"Why are we still buying straws?"
p140
aVAnd they stopped.
p141
aVAnd they learned that individually they could each make a difference,
p142
aVbut together they created an impact.
p143
aa(lp144
VIt doesn't matter if you're a student or a scientist,
p145
aVwhether you live in Honolulu or Hanoi,
p146
aVthis is a community for everyone.
p147
aVIt started because of two little kids in the Northern California woods,
p148
aVand today it's spread across the world.
p149
aVAnd you know how we're getting there?
p150
aVOne piece at a time.
p151
aa(lp152
VThank you.
