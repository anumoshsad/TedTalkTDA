VI'd like to have you look at this pencil.
p4
aVIt's a thing. It's a legal thing.
p5
aVAnd so are books you might have or the cars you own.
p6
aVThey're all legal things.
p7
aVThe great apes that you'll see behind me,
p8
aVthey too are legal things.
p9
aa(lp10
VNow, I can do that to a legal thing.
p11
aVI can do whatever I want to my book or my car.
p12
aVThese great apes, you'll see.
p13
aVThe photographs are taken by a man named James Mollison
p14
aVwho wrote a book called "James & Other Apes."
p15
aVAnd he tells in his book how every single one them,
p16
aValmost every one of them, is an orphan
p17
aVwho saw his mother and father die before his eyes.
p18
aVThey're legal things.
p19
aa(lp20
VSo for centuries, there's been a great legal wall
p21
aVthat separates legal things from legal persons.
p22
aVOn one hand, legal things are invisible to judges.
p23
aVThey don't count in law.
p24
aVThey don't have any legal rights.
p25
aVThey don't have the capacity for legal rights.
p26
aVThey are the slaves.
p27
aVOn the other side of that legal wall are the legal persons.
p28
aVLegal persons are very visible to judges.
p29
aVThey count in law.
p30
aVThey may have many rights.
p31
aVThey have the capacity for an infinite number of rights.
p32
aVAnd they're the masters.
p33
aVRight now, all nonhuman animals are legal things.
p34
aVAll human beings are legal persons.
p35
aa(lp36
VBut being human and being a legal person
p37
aVhas never been, and is not today, synonymous with a legal person.
p38
aVHumans and legal persons are not synonymous.
p39
aVOn the one side,
p40
aVthere have been many human beings over the centuries
p41
aVwho have been legal things.
p42
aVSlaves were legal things.
p43
aVWomen, children, were sometimes legal things.
p44
aVIndeed, a great deal of civil rights struggle over the last centuries
p45
aVhas been to punch a hole through that wall and begin to feed
p46
aVthese human things through the wall and have them become legal persons.
p47
aa(lp48
VBut alas, that hole has closed up.
p49
aVNow, on the other side are legal persons,
p50
aVbut they've never only been limited to human beings.
p51
aVThere are, for example, there are many legal persons who are not even alive.
p52
aVIn the United States,
p53
aVwe're aware of the fact that corporations are legal persons.
p54
aVIn pre-independence India,
p55
aVa court held that a Hindu idol was a legal person,
p56
aVthat a mosque was a legal person.
p57
aVIn 2000, the Indian Supreme Court
p58
aVheld that the holy books of the Sikh religion was a legal person,
p59
aVand in 2012, just recently,
p60
aVthere was a treaty between the indigenous peoples of New Zealand
p61
aVand the crown, in which it was agreed that a river was a legal person
p62
aVwho owned its own riverbed.
p63
aa(lp64
VNow, I read Peter Singer's book in 1980,
p65
aVwhen I had a full head of lush, brown hair,
p66
aVand indeed I was moved by it,
p67
aVbecause I had become a lawyer because I wanted to speak for the voiceless,
p68
aVdefend the defenseless,
p69
aVand I'd never realized how voiceless and defenseless the trillions,
p70
aVbillions of nonhuman animals are.
p71
aVAnd I began to work as an animal protection lawyer.
p72
aVAnd by 1985, I realized that I was trying to accomplish something
p73
aVthat was literally impossible,
p74
aVthe reason being that all of my clients,
p75
aVall the animals whose interests I was trying to defend,
p76
aVwere legal things; they were invisible.
p77
aVIt was not going to work, so I decided
p78
aVthat the only thing that was going to work was they had, at least some of them,
p79
aVhad to also be moved through a hole that we could open up again in that wall
p80
aVand begin feeding the appropriate nonhuman animals through that hole
p81
aVonto the other side of being legal persons.
p82
aa(lp83
VNow, at that time, there was very little known about or spoken about
p84
aVtruly animal rights,
p85
aVabout the idea of having legal personhood or legal rights for a nonhuman animal,
p86
aVand I knew it was going to take a long time.
p87
aVAnd so, in 1985, I figured that it would take about 30 years
p88
aVbefore we'd be able to even begin a strategic litigation,
p89
aVlong-term campaign, in order to be able to punch another hole through that wall.
p90
aVIt turned out that I was pessimistic, that it only took 28.
p91
aa(lp92
VSo what we had to do in order to begin was not only
p93
aVto write law review articles and teach classes, write books,
p94
aVbut we had to then begin to get down to the nuts and bolts
p95
aVof how you litigate that kind of case.
p96
aa(lp97
VSo one of the first things we needed to do was figure out what a cause of action was,
p98
aVa legal cause of action.
p99
aVAnd a legal cause of action is a vehicle that lawyers use
p100
aVto put their arguments in front of courts.
p101
aa(lp102
VIt turns out there's a very interesting case
p103
aVthat had occurred almost 250 years ago in London called Somerset vs. Stewart,
p104
aVwhereby a black slave had used the legal system
p105
aVand had moved from a legal thing to a legal person.
p106
aVI was so interested in it that I eventually wrote an entire book about it.
p107
aa(lp108
VJames Somerset was an eight-year-old boy when he was kidnapped from West Africa.
p109
aVHe survived the Middle Passage,
p110
aVand he was sold to a Scottish businessman named Charles Stewart in Virginia.
p111
aVNow, 20 years later, Stewart brought James Somerset to London,
p112
aVand after he got there, James decided he was going to escape.
p113
aVAnd so one of the first things he did was to get himself baptized,
p114
aVbecause he wanted to get a set of godparents,
p115
aVbecause to an 18th-century slave,
p116
aVthey knew that one of the major responsibilities of godfathers
p117
aVwas to help you escape.
p118
aa(lp119
VAnd so in the fall of 1771,
p120
aVJames Somerset had a confrontation with Charles Stewart.
p121
aVWe don't know exactly what happened, but then James dropped out of sight.
p122
aVAn enraged Charles Stewart then hired slave catchers
p123
aVto canvass the city of London,
p124
aVfind him, bring him not back to Charles Stewart,
p125
aVbut to a ship, the Ann and Mary, that was floating in London Harbour,
p126
aVand he was chained to the deck,
p127
aVand the ship was to set sail for Jamaica
p128
aVwhere James was to be sold in the slave markets
p129
aVand be doomed to the three to five years of life that a slave had
p130
aVharvesting sugar cane in Jamaica.
p131
aVWell now James' godparents swung into action.
p132
aVThey approached the most powerful judge,
p133
aVLord Mansfield, who was chief judge of the court of King's Bench,
p134
aVand they demanded that he issue a common law writ of habeus corpus
p135
aVon behalf of James Somerset.
p136
aa(lp137
VNow, the common law is the kind of law that English-speaking judges can make
p138
aVwhen they're not cabined in by statutes or constitutions,
p139
aVand a writ of habeus corpus is called the Great Writ,
p140
aVcapital G, capital W,
p141
aVand it's meant to protect any of us who are detained against our will.
p142
aVA writ of habeus corpus is issued.
p143
aVThe detainer is required to bring the detainee in
p144
aVand give a legally sufficient reason for depriving him of his bodily liberty.
p145
aa(lp146
VWell, Lord Mansfield had to make a decision right off the bat,
p147
aVbecause if James Somerset was a legal thing,
p148
aVhe was not eligible for a writ of habeus corpus,
p149
aVonly if he could be a legal person.
p150
aVSo Lord Mansfield decided that he would assume,
p151
aVwithout deciding, that James Somerset was indeed a legal person,
p152
aVand he issued the writ of habeus corpus, and James's body was brought in
p153
aVby the captain of the ship.
p154
aa(lp155
VThere were a series of hearings over the next six months.
p156
aVOn June 22, 1772, Lord Mansfield said that slavery was so odious,
p157
aVand he used the word "odious,"
p158
aVthat the common law would not support it, and he ordered James free.
p159
aVAt that moment, James Somerset underwent a legal transubstantiation.
p160
aVThe free man who walked out of the courtroom
p161
aVlooked exactly like the slave who had walked in,
p162
aVbut as far as the law was concerned, they had nothing whatsoever in common.
p163
aa(lp164
VThe next thing we did is that the Nonhuman Rights Project,
p165
aVwhich I founded, then began to look at what kind of values and principles
p166
aVdo we want to put before the judges?
p167
aVWhat values and principles did they imbibe with their mother's milk,
p168
aVwere they taught in law school, do they use every day,
p169
aVdo they believe with all their hearts \u2014 and we chose liberty and equality.
p170
aa(lp171
VNow, liberty right is the kind of right to which you're entitled
p172
aVbecause of how you're put together,
p173
aVand a fundamental liberty right protects a fundamental interest.
p174
aVAnd the supreme interest in the common law
p175
aVare the rights to autonomy and self-determination.
p176
aVSo they are so powerful that in a common law country,
p177
aVif you go to a hospital and you refuse life-saving medical treatment,
p178
aVa judge will not order it forced upon you,
p179
aVbecause they will respect your self-determination and your autonomy.
p180
aa(lp181
VNow, an equality right is the kind of right to which you're entitled
p182
aVbecause you resemble someone else in a relevant way,
p183
aVand there's the rub, relevant way.
p184
aVSo if you are that, then because they have the right, you're like them,
p185
aVyou're entitled to the right.
p186
aVNow, courts and legislatures draw lines all the time.
p187
aVSome are included, some are excluded.
p188
aVBut you have to, at the bare minimum you must \u2014
p189
aVthat line has to be a reasonable means to a legitimate end.
p190
aVThe Nonhuman Rights Project argues that drawing a line
p191
aVin order to enslave an autonomous and self-determining being
p192
aVlike you're seeing behind me,
p193
aVthat that's a violation of equality.
p194
aa(lp195
VWe then searched through 80 jurisdictions,
p196
aVit took us seven years, to find the jurisdiction
p197
aVwhere we wanted to begin filing our first suit.
p198
aVWe chose the state of New York.
p199
aVThen we decided upon who our plaintiffs are going to be.
p200
aVWe decided upon chimpanzees,
p201
aVnot just because Jane Goodall was on our board of directors,
p202
aVbut because they, Jane and others,
p203
aVhave studied chimpanzees intensively for decades.
p204
aVWe know the extraordinary cognitive capabilities that they have,
p205
aVand they also resemble the kind that human beings have.
p206
aVAnd so we chose chimpanzees, and we began to then canvass the world
p207
aVto find the experts in chimpanzee cognition.
p208
aVWe found them in Japan, Sweden, Germany, Scotland, England and the United States,
p209
aVand amongst them, they wrote 100 pages of affidavits
p210
aVin which they set out more than 40 ways
p211
aVin which their complex cognitive capability,
p212
aVeither individually or together,
p213
aVall added up to autonomy and self-determination.
p214
aa(lp215
VNow, these included, for example, that they were conscious.
p216
aVBut they're also conscious that they're conscious.
p217
aVThey know they have a mind. They know that others have minds.
p218
aVThey know they're individuals, and that they can live.
p219
aVThey understand that they lived yesterday and they will live tomorrow.
p220
aVThey engage in mental time travel. They remember what happened yesterday.
p221
aVThey can anticipate tomorrow,
p222
aVwhich is why it's so terrible to imprison a chimpanzee, especially alone.
p223
aVIt's the thing that we do to our worst criminals,
p224
aVand we do that to chimpanzees without even thinking about it.
p225
aa(lp226
VThey have some kind of moral capacity.
p227
aVWhen they play economic games with human beings,
p228
aVthey'll spontaneously make fair offers, even when they're not required to do so.
p229
aVThey are numerate. They understand numbers.
p230
aVThey can do some simple math.
p231
aVThey can engage in language \u2014 or to stay out of the language wars,
p232
aVthey're involved in intentional and referential communication
p233
aVin which they pay attention to the attitudes of those
p234
aVwith whom they are speaking.
p235
aVThey have culture.
p236
aVThey have a material culture, a social culture.
p237
aVThey have a symbolic culture.
p238
aVScientists in the Taï Forests in the Ivory Coast
p239
aVfound chimpanzees who were using these rocks to smash open
p240
aVthe incredibly hard hulls of nuts.
p241
aVIt takes a long time to learn how to do that,
p242
aVand they excavated the area and they found
p243
aVthat this material culture, this way of doing it,
p244
aVthese rocks, had passed down for at least 4,300 years
p245
aVthrough 225 chimpanzee generations.
p246
aa(lp247
VSo now we needed to find our chimpanzee.
p248
aVOur chimpanzee,
p249
aVfirst we found two of them in the state of New York.
p250
aVBoth of them would die before we could even get our suits filed.
p251
aVThen we found Tommy.
p252
aVTommy is a chimpanzee. You see him behind me.
p253
aVTommy was a chimpanzee. We found him in that cage.
p254
aVWe found him in a small room that was filled with cages
p255
aVin a larger warehouse structure on a used trailer lot in central New York.
p256
aVWe found Kiko, who is partially deaf.
p257
aVKiko was in the back of a cement storefront in western Massachusetts.
p258
aVAnd we found Hercules and Leo.
p259
aVThey're two young male chimpanzees
p260
aVwho are being used for biomedical, anatomical research at Stony Brook.
p261
aVWe found them.
p262
aa(lp263
VAnd so on the last week of December 2013,
p264
aVthe Nonhuman Rights Project filed three suits all across the state of New York
p265
aVusing the same common law writ of habeus corpus argument
p266
aVthat had been used with James Somerset,
p267
aVand we demanded that the judges issue these common law writs of habeus corpus.
p268
aVWe wanted the chimpanzees out,
p269
aVand we wanted them brought to Save the Chimps,
p270
aVa tremendous chimpanzee sanctuary in South Florida
p271
aVwhich involves an artificial lake with 12 or 13 islands \u2014
p272
aVthere are two or three acres where two dozen chimpanzees live
p273
aVon each of them.
p274
aVAnd these chimpanzees would then live the life of a chimpanzee,
p275
aVwith other chimpanzees in an environment that was as close to Africa as possible.
p276
aa(lp277
VNow, all these cases are still going on.
p278
aVWe have not yet run into our Lord Mansfield.
p279
aVWe shall. We shall.
p280
aVThis is a long-term strategic litigation campaign. We shall.
p281
aVAnd to quote Winston Churchill,
p282
aVthe way we view our cases is that they're not the end,
p283
aVthey're not even the beginning of the end,
p284
aVbut they are perhaps the end of the beginning.
p285
aa(lp286
