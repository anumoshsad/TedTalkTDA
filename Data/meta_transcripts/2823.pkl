VThe first time I cried underwater
p4
aVwas in 2008,
p5
aVthe island of Curaçao,
p6
aVway down in the southern Caribbean.
p7
aVIt's beautiful there.
p8
aVI was studying these corals for my PhD,
p9
aVand after days and days of diving on the same reef,
p10
aVI had gotten to know them as individuals.
p11
aVI had made friends with coral colonies \u2014
p12
aVtotally a normal thing to do.
p13
aVThen, Hurricane Omar smashed them apart and ripped off their skin,
p14
aVleaving little bits of wounded tissue that would have a hard time healing,
p15
aVand big patches of dead skeleton that would get overgrown by algae.
p16
aVWhen I saw this damage for the first time,
p17
aVstretching all the way down the reef,
p18
aVI sunk onto the sand in my scuba gear
p19
aVand I cried.
p20
aVIf a coral could die that fast,
p21
aVhow could a reef ever survive?
p22
aVAnd why was I making it my job to try to fight for them?
p23
aa(lp24
VI never heard another scientist tell that kind of story
p25
aVuntil last year.
p26
aVA scientist in Guam wrote,
p27
aV"I cried right into my mask,"
p28
aVseeing the damage on the reefs.
p29
aVThen a scientist in Australia wrote,
p30
aV"I showed my students the results of our coral surveys,
p31
aVand we wept."
p32
aVCrying about corals is having a moment, guys.
p33
aa(lp34
V(Laughter)
p35
aa(lp36
VAnd that's because reefs in the Pacific
p37
aVare losing corals faster than we've ever seen before.
p38
aVBecause of climate change,
p39
aVthe water is so hot for so long in the summers,
p40
aVthat these animals can't function normally.
p41
aVThey're spitting out the colored algae that lives in their skin,
p42
aVand the clear bleached tissue that's left usually starves to death
p43
aVand then rots away.
p44
aVThen the skeletons are overgrown by algae.
p45
aa(lp46
VThis is happening over an unbelievable scale.
p47
aVThe Northern Great Barrier Reef lost two-thirds of its corals last year
p48
aVover a distance of hundreds of miles,
p49
aVthen bleached again this year,
p50
aVand the bleaching stretched further south.
p51
aVReefs in the Pacific are in a nosedive right now,
p52
aVand no one knows how bad it's going to get,
p53
aVexcept ...
p54
aVover in the Caribbean where I work,
p55
aVwe've already been through the nosedive.
p56
aVReefs there have suffered through centuries of intense human abuse.
p57
aVWe kind of already know how the story goes.
p58
aVAnd we might be able to help predict what happens next.
p59
aa(lp60
VLet's consult a graph.
p61
aVSince the invention of scuba,
p62
aVscientists have measured the amount of coral on the seafloor,
p63
aVand how it's changed through time.
p64
aVAnd after centuries of ratcheting human pressure,
p65
aVCaribbean reefs met one of three fates.
p66
aVSome reefs lost their corals very quickly.
p67
aVSome reefs lost their corals more slowly,
p68
aVbut kind of ended up in the same place.
p69
aVOK, so far this is not going very well.
p70
aVBut some reefs in the Caribbean \u2014
p71
aVthe ones best protected
p72
aVand the ones a little further from humans \u2014
p73
aVthey managed to hold onto their corals.
p74
aVGive us a challenge.
p75
aVAnd, we almost never saw a reef hit zero.
p76
aa(lp77
VThe second time I cried underwater
p78
aVwas on the north shore of Curaçao, 2011.
p79
aVIt was the calmest day of the year,
p80
aVbut it's always pretty sketchy diving there.
p81
aVMy boyfriend and I swam against the waves.
p82
aVI watched my compass so we could find our way back out,
p83
aVand he watched for sharks,
p84
aVand after 20 minutes of swimming that felt like an hour,
p85
aVwe finally dropped down to the reef,
p86
aVand I was so shocked,
p87
aVand I was so happy
p88
aVthat my eyes filled with tears.
p89
aVThere were corals 1,000 years old lined up one after another.
p90
aVThey had survived the entire history of European colonialism in the Caribbean,
p91
aVand for centuries before that.
p92
aa(lp93
VI never knew what a coral could do when it was given a chance to thrive.
p94
aVThe truth is that even as we lose so many corals,
p95
aVeven as we go through this massive coral die-off,
p96
aVsome reefs will survive.
p97
aVSome will be ragged on the edge,
p98
aVsome will be beautiful.
p99
aVAnd by protecting shorelines and giving us food to eat
p100
aVand supporting tourism,
p101
aVthey will still be worth billions and billions of dollars a year.
p102
aVThe best time to protect a reef was 50 years ago,
p103
aVbut the second-best time is right now.
p104
aVEven as we go through bleaching events,
p105
aVmore frequent and in more places,
p106
aVsome corals will be able to recover.
p107
aa(lp108
VWe had a bleaching event in 2010 in the Caribbean
p109
aVthat took off big patches of skin on boulder corals like these.
p110
aVThis coral lost half of its skin.
p111
aVBut if you look at the side of this coral a few years later,
p112
aVthis coral is actually healthy again.
p113
aVIt's doing what a healthy coral does.
p114
aVIt's making copies of its polyps,
p115
aVit's fighting back the algae
p116
aVand it's reclaiming its territory.
p117
aVIf a few polyps survive,
p118
aVa coral can regrow;
p119
aVit just needs time and protection and a reasonable temperature.
p120
aVSome corals can regrow in 10 years \u2014
p121
aVothers take a lot longer.
p122
aVBut the more stresses we take off them locally \u2014
p123
aVthings like overfishing, sewage pollution, fertilizer pollution,
p124
aVdredging, coastal construction \u2014
p125
aVthe better they can hang on as we stabilize the climate,
p126
aVand the faster they can regrow.
p127
aa(lp128
VAnd as we go through the long, tough and necessary process
p129
aVof stabilizing the climate of planet Earth,
p130
aVsome new corals will still be born.
p131
aVThis is what I study in my research.
p132
aVWe try to understand how corals make babies,
p133
aVand how those babies find their way to the reef,
p134
aVand we invent new methods to help them survive
p135
aVthose early, fragile life stages.
p136
aVOne of my favorite coral babies of all time
p137
aVshowed up right after Hurricane Omar.
p138
aVIt's the same species I was studying before the storm,
p139
aVbut you almost never see babies of this species \u2014
p140
aVit's really rare.
p141
aVThis is actually an endangered species.
p142
aVIn this photo, this little baby coral, this little circle of polyps,
p143
aVis a few years old.
p144
aVLike its cousins that bleach,
p145
aVit's fighting back the algae.
p146
aVAnd like its cousins on the north shore,
p147
aVit's aiming to live for 1,000 years.
p148
aa(lp149
VWhat's happening in the world and in the ocean
p150
aVhas changed our time horizon.
p151
aVWe can be incredibly pessimistic on the short term,
p152
aVand mourn what we lost
p153
aVand what we really took for granted.
p154
aVBut we can still be optimistic on the long term,
p155
aVand we can still be ambitious about what we fight for
p156
aVand what we expect from our governments,
p157
aVfrom our planet.
p158
aVCorals have been living on planet Earth for hundreds of millions of years.
p159
aVThey survived the extinction of the dinosaurs.
p160
aVThey're badasses.
p161
aa(lp162
V(Laughter)
p163
aa(lp164
VAn individual coral can go through tremendous trauma and fully recover
p165
aVif it's given a chance and it's given protection.
p166
aVCorals have always been playing the long game,
p167
aVand now so are we.
p168
aa(lp169
VThanks very much.
