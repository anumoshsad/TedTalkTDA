VI was three months pregnant with twins
p4
aVwhen my husband Ross and I went to my second sonogram.
p5
aa(lp6
VI was 35 years old at the time,
p7
aVand I knew that that meant we had a higher risk
p8
aVof having a child with a birth defect.
p9
aVSo, Ross and I researched the standard birth defects,
p10
aVand we felt reasonably prepared.
p11
aa(lp12
VWell, nothing would have prepared us
p13
aVfor the bizarre diagnosis that we were about to face.
p14
aVThe doctor explained that one of our twins, Thomas,
p15
aVhad a fatal birth defect called anencephaly.
p16
aVThis means that his brain was not formed correctly
p17
aVbecause part of his skull was missing.
p18
aVBabies with this diagnosis typically die in utero
p19
aVor within a few minutes, hours or days of being born.
p20
aVBut the other twin, Callum,
p21
aVappeared to be healthy, as far as the doctor could tell,
p22
aVand these twins were identical,
p23
aVgenetically identical.
p24
aa(lp25
VSo after a lot of questions about how this could have possibly happened,
p26
aVa selective reduction was mentioned,
p27
aVand while this procedure was not impossible,
p28
aVit posed some unique risks for the healthy twin and for me,
p29
aVso we decided to carry the pregnancy to term.
p30
aVSo there I was, three months pregnant, with two trimesters ahead of me,
p31
aVand I had to find a way to manage my blood pressure and my stress.
p32
aVAnd it felt like having a roommate point a loaded gun at you for six months.
p33
aVBut I stared down the barrel of that gun for so long
p34
aVthat I saw a light at the end of the tunnel.
p35
aVWhile there was nothing we could do to prevent the tragedy,
p36
aVI wanted to find a way for Thomas's brief life
p37
aVto have some kind of positive impact.
p38
aa(lp39
VSo I asked my nurse about organ, eye and tissue donation.
p40
aVShe connected with our local organ-procurement organization,
p41
aVthe Washington Regional Transplant Community.
p42
aVWRTC explained to me
p43
aVthat Thomas would probably be too small at birth to donate for transplant,
p44
aVand I was shocked:
p45
aVI didn't even know you could be rejected for that.
p46
aVBut they said that he would be a good candidate to donate for research.
p47
aVThis helped me see Thomas in a new light.
p48
aVAs opposed to just a victim of a disease,
p49
aVI started to see him as a possible key to unlock a medical mystery.
p50
aa(lp51
VOn March 23, 2010,
p52
aVthe twins were born, and they were both born alive.
p53
aVAnd just like the doctor said,
p54
aVThomas was missing the top part of his skull,
p55
aVbut he could nurse,
p56
aVdrink from a bottle,
p57
aVcuddle and grab our fingers like a normal baby,
p58
aVand he slept in our arms.
p59
aVAfter six days, Thomas died in Ross's arms
p60
aVsurrounded by our family.
p61
aa(lp62
VWe called WRTC, who sent a van to our home
p63
aVand brought him to Children's National Medical Center.
p64
aVA few hours later, we got a call to say that the recovery was a success,
p65
aVand Thomas's donations would be going to four different places.
p66
aVHis cord blood would go to Duke University.
p67
aVHis liver would go to a cell-therapy company called Cytonet in Durham.
p68
aVHis corneas would go to Schepens Eye Research Institute,
p69
aVwhich is part of Harvard Medical School,
p70
aVand his retinas would go to the University of Pennsylvania.
p71
aa(lp72
VA few days later, we had a funeral with our immediate family,
p73
aVincluding baby Callum,
p74
aVand we basically closed this chapter in our lives.
p75
aVBut I did find myself wondering, what's happening now?
p76
aVWhat are the researchers learning?
p77
aVAnd was it even worthwhile to donate?
p78
aa(lp79
VWRTC invited Ross and I to a grief retreat,
p80
aVand we met about 15 other grieving families
p81
aVwho had donated their loved one's organs for transplant.
p82
aVSome of them had even received letters
p83
aVfrom the people who received their loved one's organs,
p84
aVsaying thank you.
p85
aVI learned that they could even meet each other
p86
aVif they'd both sign a waiver,
p87
aValmost like an open adoption.
p88
aVAnd I was so excited, I thought maybe I could write a letter
p89
aVor I could get a letter and learn about what happened.
p90
aVBut I was disappointed to learn
p91
aVthat this process only exists for people who donate for transplant.
p92
aVSo I was jealous. I had transplant envy, I guess.
p93
aa(lp94
V(Laughter)
p95
aa(lp96
VBut over the years that followed,
p97
aVI learned a lot more about donation,
p98
aVand I even got a job in the field.
p99
aa(lp100
VAnd I came up with an idea.
p101
aVI wrote a letter that started out,
p102
aV"Dear Researcher."
p103
aVI explained who I was,
p104
aVand I asked if they could tell me why they requested infant retinas
p105
aVin March of 2010,
p106
aVand I asked if my family could visit their lab.
p107
aVI emailed it to the eye bank that arranged the donation,
p108
aVthe Old Dominion Eye Foundation,
p109
aVand asked if they could send it to the right person.
p110
aVThey said that they had never done this before,
p111
aVand they couldn't guarantee a response,
p112
aVbut they wouldn't be an obstacle, and they would deliver it.
p113
aa(lp114
VTwo days later, I got a response
p115
aVfrom Dr. Arupa Ganguly of the University of Pennsylvania.
p116
aVShe thanked me for the donation,
p117
aVand she explained that she is studying retinoblastoma,
p118
aVwhich is a deadly cancer of the retina
p119
aVthat affects children under the age of five,
p120
aVand she said that yes, we were invited to visit her lab.
p121
aa(lp122
VSo next we talked on the phone,
p123
aVand one of the first things she said to me
p124
aVwas that she couldn't possibly imagine how we felt,
p125
aVand that Thomas had given the ultimate sacrifice,
p126
aVand that she seemed to feel indebted to us.
p127
aVSo I said, "Nothing against your study,
p128
aVbut we didn't actually pick it.
p129
aVWe donated to the system, and the system chose your study.
p130
aVI said, "And second of all, bad things happen to children every day,
p131
aVand if you didn't want these retinas,
p132
aVthey would probably be buried in the ground right now.
p133
aVSo to be able to participate in your study
p134
aVgives Thomas's life a new layer of meaning.
p135
aVSo, never feel guilty about using this tissue."
p136
aa(lp137
VNext, she explained to me how rare it was.
p138
aVShe had placed a request for this tissue six years earlier
p139
aVwith the National Disease Research Interchange.
p140
aVShe got only one sample of tissue that fit her criteria,
p141
aVand it was Thomas's.
p142
aa(lp143
VNext, we arranged a date for me to come visit the lab,
p144
aVand we chose March 23, 2015, which was the twins' fifth birthday.
p145
aVAfter we hung up, I emailed her some pictures of Thomas and Callum,
p146
aVand a few weeks later, we received this T-shirt in the mail.
p147
aa(lp148
VA few months later, Ross, Callum and I piled in the car
p149
aVand we went for a road trip.
p150
aVWe met Arupa and her staff,
p151
aVand Arupa said that when I told her not to feel guilty, that it was a relief,
p152
aVand that she hadn't seen it from our perspective.
p153
aVShe also explained that Thomas had a secret code name.
p154
aVThe same way Henrietta Lacks is called HeLa,
p155
aVThomas was called RES 360.
p156
aVRES means research,
p157
aVand 360 means he was the 360th specimen
p158
aVover the course of about 10 years.
p159
aa(lp160
VShe also shared with us a unique document,
p161
aVand it was the shipping label
p162
aVthat sent his retinas from DC to Philadelphia.
p163
aVThis shipping label is like an heirloom to us now.
p164
aVIt's the same way that a military medal or a wedding certificate might be.
p165
aa(lp166
VArupa also explained that she is using Thomas's retina and his RNA
p167
aVto try to inactivate the gene that causes tumor formation,
p168
aVand she even showed us some results that were based on RES 360.
p169
aVThen she took us to the freezer
p170
aVand she showed us the two samples that she still has
p171
aVthat are still labeled RES 360.
p172
aVThere's two little ones left.
p173
aVShe said she saved it
p174
aVbecause she doesn't know when she might get more.
p175
aVAfter this, we went to the conference room
p176
aVand we relaxed and we had lunch together,
p177
aVand the lab staff presented Callum with a birthday gift.
p178
aVIt was a child's lab kit.
p179
aVAnd they also offered him an internship.
p180
aa(lp181
V(Laughter)
p182
aa(lp183
VSo in closing, I have two simple messages today.
p184
aVOne is that most of us probably don't think about donating to research.
p185
aVI know I didn't. I think I'm a normal person.
p186
aVBut I did it.
p187
aVIt was a good experience, and I recommend it,
p188
aVand it brought my family a lot of peace.
p189
aVAnd second is if you work with human tissue
p190
aVand you wonder about the donor and about the family,
p191
aVwrite them a letter.
p192
aVTell them you received it, tell them what you're working on,
p193
aVand invite them to visit your lab,
p194
aVbecause that visit may be even more gratifying for you
p195
aVthan it is for them.
p196
aVAnd I'd also like to ask you a favor.
p197
aVIf you're ever successful in arranging one of these visits,
p198
aVplease tell me about it.
p199
aa(lp200
VThe other part of my family's story
p201
aVis that we ended up visiting all four facilities
p202
aVthat received Thomas's donations.
p203
aVAnd we met amazing people doing inspiring work.
p204
aVThe way I see it now is that Thomas got into Harvard,
p205
aVDuke and Penn \u2014
p206
aa(lp207
V(Laughter)
p208
aa(lp209
VAnd he has a job at Cytonet,
p210
aVand he has colleagues and he has coworkers
p211
aVwho are in the top of their fields.
p212
aVAnd they need him in order to do their job.
p213
aVAnd a life that once seemed brief and insignificant
p214
aVrevealed itself to be vital, everlasting and relevant.
p215
aVAnd I only hope that my life can be as relevant.
p216
aa(lp217
VThank you.
