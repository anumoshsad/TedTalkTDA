VMy job is to design, build and study robots that communicate with people.
p4
aVBut this story doesn't start with robotics at all, it starts with animation.
p5
aVWhen I first saw Pixar's "Luxo Jr.,"
p6
aVI was amazed by how much emotion they could put
p7
aVinto something as trivial as a desk lamp.
p8
aVI mean, look at them \u2014 at the end of this movie,
p9
aVyou actually feel something for two pieces of furniture.
p10
aa(lp11
V(Laughter)
p12
aa(lp13
VAnd I said, I have to learn how to do this.
p14
aVSo I made a really bad career decision.
p15
aa(lp16
V(Laughter)
p17
aa(lp18
VAnd that's what my mom was like when I did it.
p19
aa(lp20
V(Laughter)
p21
aa(lp22
VI left a very cozy tech job in Israel at a nice software company
p23
aVand I moved to New York to study animation.
p24
aVAnd there I lived
p25
aVin a collapsing apartment building in Harlem with roommates.
p26
aVI'm not using this phrase metaphorically \u2014
p27
aVthe ceiling actually collapsed one day in our living room.
p28
aVWhenever they did news stories about building violations in New York,
p29
aVthey would put the report in front of our building,
p30
aVas kind of, like, a backdrop to show how bad things are.
p31
aa(lp32
VAnyway, during the day, I went to school
p33
aVand at night I would sit and draw frame by frame of pencil animation.
p34
aVAnd I learned two surprising lessons.
p35
aVOne of them was that when you want to arouse emotions,
p36
aVit doesn't matter so much how something looks;
p37
aVit's all in the motion, in the timing of how the thing moves.
p38
aVAnd the second was something one of our teachers told us.
p39
aVHe actually did the weasel in "Ice Age."
p40
aVAnd he said, "As an animator, you're not a director \u2014 you're an actor."
p41
aVSo, if you want to find the right motion for a character,
p42
aVdon't think about it \u2014 go use your body to find it.
p43
aVStand in front of a mirror, act it out in front of a camera \u2014
p44
aVwhatever you need \u2014 and then put it back in your character.
p45
aa(lp46
VA year later I found myself at MIT in the Robotic Life Group.
p47
aVIt was one of the first groups researching the relationships
p48
aVbetween humans and robots.
p49
aVAnd I still had this dream to make an actual, physical Luxo Jr. lamp.
p50
aVBut I found that robots didn't move at all in this engaging way
p51
aVthat I was used to from my animation studies.
p52
aVInstead, they were all \u2014 how should I put it \u2014
p53
aVthey were all kind of robotic.
p54
aV(Laughter)
p55
aVAnd I thought, what if I took whatever I learned in animation school,
p56
aVand used that to design my robotic desk lamp.
p57
aVSo I went and designed frame by frame
p58
aVto try to make this robot as graceful and engaging as possible.
p59
aVAnd here when you see the robot interacting with me on a desktop \u2014
p60
aVand I'm actually redesigning the robot,
p61
aVso, unbeknownst to itself,
p62
aVit's kind of digging its own grave by helping me.
p63
aa(lp64
V(Laughter)
p65
aa(lp66
VI wanted it to be less of a mechanical structure giving me light,
p67
aVand more of a helpful, kind of quiet apprentice
p68
aVthat's always there when you need it and doesn't really interfere.
p69
aVAnd when, for example, I'm looking for a battery that I can't find,
p70
aVin a subtle way, it'll show me where the battery is.
p71
aVSo you can see my confusion here.
p72
aVI'm not an actor.
p73
aVAnd I want you to notice how the same mechanical structure
p74
aVcan, at one point, just by the way it moves,
p75
aVseem gentle and caring and in the other case,
p76
aVseem violent and confrontational.
p77
aVAnd it's the same structure, just the motion is different.
p78
aVActor: "You want to know something? Well, you want to know something?
p79
aVHe was already dead!
p80
aVJust laying there, eyes glazed over!"
p81
aa(lp82
V(Laughter)
p83
aa(lp84
VBut, moving in a graceful way is just one building block
p85
aVof this whole structure called human-robot interaction.
p86
aVI was, at the time, doing my PhD, I was working on human-robot teamwork,
p87
aVteams of humans and robots working together.
p88
aVI was studying the engineering,
p89
aVthe psychology, the philosophy of teamwork,
p90
aVand at the same time,
p91
aVI found myself in my own kind of teamwork situation,
p92
aVwith a good friend of mine, who's actually here.
p93
aVAnd in that situation, we can easily imagine robots
p94
aVin the near future being there with us.
p95
aVIt was after a Passover Seder.
p96
aVWe were folding up a lot of folding chairs,
p97
aVand I was amazed at how quickly we found our own rhythm.
p98
aVEverybody did their own part, we didn't have to divide our tasks.
p99
aVWe didn't have to communicate verbally about this \u2014
p100
aVit all just happened.
p101
aa(lp102
VAnd I thought, humans and robots don't look at all like this.
p103
aVWhen humans and robots interact, it's much more like a chess game:
p104
aVthe human does a thing, the robot analyzes whatever the human did,
p105
aVthe robot decides what to do next, plans it and does it.
p106
aVThen the human waits, until it's their turn again.
p107
aVSo it's much more like a chess game, and that makes sense,
p108
aVbecause chess is great for mathematicians and computer scientists.
p109
aVIt's all about information, analysis, decision-making and planning.
p110
aa(lp111
VBut I wanted my robot to be less of a chess player,
p112
aVand more like a doer
p113
aVthat just clicks and works together.
p114
aVSo I made my second horrible career choice:
p115
aVI decided to study acting for a semester.
p116
aVI took off from the PhD, I went to acting classes.
p117
aVI actually participated in a play \u2014
p118
aVI hope there\u2019s no video of that around still.
p119
aa(lp120
V(Laughter)
p121
aa(lp122
VAnd I got every book I could find about acting,
p123
aVincluding one from the 19th century that I got from the library.
p124
aVAnd I was really amazed, because my name was the second name on the list \u2014
p125
aVthe previous name was in 1889.
p126
aa(lp127
V(Laughter)
p128
aa(lp129
VAnd this book was kind of waiting for 100 years
p130
aVto be rediscovered for robotics.
p131
aVAnd this book shows actors
p132
aVhow to move every muscle in the body
p133
aVto match every kind of emotion that they want to express.
p134
aa(lp135
VBut the real revelation was when I learned about method acting.
p136
aVIt became very popular in the 20th century.
p137
aVAnd method acting said
p138
aVyou don't have to plan every muscle in your body;
p139
aVinstead, you have to use your body to find the right movement.
p140
aVYou have to use your sense memory to reconstruct the emotions
p141
aVand kind of think with your body to find the right expression \u2014
p142
aVimprovise, play off your scene partner.
p143
aVAnd this came at the same time
p144
aVas I was reading about this trend in cognitive psychology,
p145
aVcalled embodied cognition, which also talks about the same ideas.
p146
aVWe use our bodies to think;
p147
aVwe don't just think with our brains and use our bodies to move,
p148
aVbut our bodies feed back into our brain
p149
aVto generate the way that we behave.
p150
aa(lp151
VAnd it was like a lightning bolt.
p152
aVI went back to my office,
p153
aVI wrote this paper, which I never really published,
p154
aVcalled "Acting Lessons for Artificial Intelligence."
p155
aVAnd I even took another month
p156
aVto do what was then the first theater play
p157
aVwith a human and a robot acting together.
p158
aVThat's what you saw before with the actors.
p159
aVAnd I thought:
p160
aVHow can we make an artificial intelligence model \u2014
p161
aVa computer, computational model \u2014
p162
aVthat will model some of these ideas of improvisation,
p163
aVof taking risks, of taking chances,
p164
aVeven of making mistakes?
p165
aVMaybe it can make for better robotic teammates.
p166
aVSo I worked for quite a long time on these models
p167
aVand I implemented them on a number of robots.
p168
aa(lp169
VHere you can see a very early example
p170
aVwith the robots trying to use this embodied artificial intelligence
p171
aVto try to match my movements as closely as possible.
p172
aVIt's sort of like a game.
p173
aVLet's look at it.
p174
aVYou can see when I psych it out, it gets fooled.
p175
aVAnd it's a little bit like what you might see actors do
p176
aVwhen they try to mirror each other
p177
aVto find the right synchrony between them.
p178
aVAnd then, I did another experiment,
p179
aVand I got people off the street to use the robotic desk lamp,
p180
aVand try out this idea of embodied artificial intelligence.
p181
aVSo, I actually used two kinds of brains for the same robot.
p182
aa(lp183
VThe robot is the same lamp that you saw,
p184
aVand I put two brains in it.
p185
aVFor one half of the people,
p186
aVI put in a brain that's kind of the traditional,
p187
aVcalculated robotic brain.
p188
aVIt waits for its turn, it analyzes everything, it plans.
p189
aVLet's call it the calculated brain.
p190
aVThe other got more the stage actor, risk-taker brain.
p191
aVLet's call it the adventurous brain.
p192
aVIt sometimes acts without knowing everything it has to know.
p193
aVIt sometimes makes mistakes and corrects them.
p194
aVAnd I had them do this very tedious task that took almost 20 minutes,
p195
aVand they had to work together,
p196
aVsomehow simulating, like, a factory job
p197
aVof repetitively doing the same thing.
p198
aVWhat I found is that people actually loved the adventurous robot.
p199
aVThey thought it was more intelligent,
p200
aVmore committed, a better member of the team,
p201
aVcontributed to the success of the team more.
p202
aVThey even called it "he" and "she,"
p203
aVwhereas people with the calculated brain
p204
aVcalled it "it," and nobody ever called it "he" or "she."
p205
aVWhen they talked about it after the task, with the adventurous brain,
p206
aVthey said, "By the end, we were good friends and high-fived mentally."
p207
aVWhatever that means.
p208
aa(lp209
V(Laughter)
p210
aa(lp211
VSounds painful.
p212
aVWhereas the people with the calculated brain
p213
aVsaid it was just like a lazy apprentice.
p214
aVIt only did what it was supposed to do and nothing more,
p215
aVwhich is almost what people expect robots to do,
p216
aVso I was surprised that people had higher expectations of robots
p217
aVthan what anybody in robotics thought robots should be doing.
p218
aVAnd in a way, I thought, maybe it's time \u2014
p219
aVjust like method acting changed the way people thought
p220
aVabout acting in the 19th century,
p221
aVfrom going from the very calculated, planned way of behaving,
p222
aVto a more intuitive, risk-taking, embodied way of behaving \u2014
p223
aVmaybe it's time for robots to have the same kind of revolution.
p224
aa(lp225
VA few years later, I was at my next research job at Georgia Tech in Atlanta,
p226
aVand I was working in a group dealing with robotic musicians.
p227
aVAnd I thought, music: that's the perfect place
p228
aVto look at teamwork, coordination, timing, improvisation \u2014
p229
aVand we just got this robot playing marimba.
p230
aVAnd the marimba, for everybody like me,
p231
aVit was this huge, wooden xylophone.
p232
aVAnd when I was looking at this,
p233
aVI looked at other works in human-robot improvisation \u2014
p234
aVyes, there are other works in human-robot improvisation \u2014
p235
aVand they were also a little bit like a chess game.
p236
aVThe human would play,
p237
aVthe robot analyzed what was played,
p238
aVand would improvise their own part.
p239
aVSo, this is what musicians called a call-and-response interaction,
p240
aVand it also fits very well robots and artificial intelligence.
p241
aVBut I thought, if I use the same ideas I used in the theater play
p242
aVand in the teamwork studies,
p243
aVmaybe I can make the robots jam together like a band.
p244
aVEverybody's riffing off each other, nobody is stopping for a moment.
p245
aVAnd so I tried to do the same things, this time with music,
p246
aVwhere the robot doesn't really know what it's about to play,
p247
aVit just sort of moves its body and uses opportunities to play,
p248
aVand does what my jazz teacher when I was 17 taught me.
p249
aVShe said, when you improvise,
p250
aVsometimes you don't know what you're doing, and you still do it.
p251
aVSo I tried to make a robot that doesn't actually know what it's doing,
p252
aVbut is still doing it.
p253
aVSo let's look at a few seconds from this performance,
p254
aVwhere the robot listens to the human musician
p255
aVand improvises.
p256
aVAnd then, look how the human musician also responds
p257
aVto what the robot is doing
p258
aVand picking up from its behavior,
p259
aVand at some point can even be surprised by what the robot came up with.
p260
aa(lp261
V(Music)
p262
aa(lp263
V(Music ends)
p264
aa(lp265
V(Applause)
p266
aa(lp267
VBeing a musician is not just about making notes,
p268
aVotherwise nobody would ever go see a live show.
p269
aVMusicians also communicate with their bodies,
p270
aVwith other band members, with the audience,
p271
aVthey use their bodies to express the music.
p272
aVAnd I thought, we already have a robot musician on stage,
p273
aVwhy not make it be a full-fledged musician?
p274
aVAnd I started designing a socially expressive head
p275
aVfor the robot.
p276
aVThe head doesn\u2019t actually touch the marimba,
p277
aVit just expresses what the music is like.
p278
aVThese are some napkin sketches from a bar in Atlanta
p279
aVthat was dangerously located exactly halfway
p280
aVbetween my lab and my home.
p281
aVSo I spent, I would say, on average, three to four hours a day there.
p282
aVI think.
p283
aa(lp284
V(Laughter)
p285
aa(lp286
VAnd I went back to my animation tools and tried to figure out
p287
aVnot just what a robotic musician would look like,
p288
aVbut especially what a robotic musician would move like,
p289
aVto sort of show that it doesn't like what the other person is playing \u2014
p290
aVand maybe show whatever beat it's feeling at the moment.
p291
aa(lp292
VSo we ended up actually getting the money to build this robot, which was nice.
p293
aVI'm going to show you now the same kind of performance,
p294
aVthis time with a socially expressive head.
p295
aVAnd notice one thing \u2014
p296
aVhow the robot is really showing us
p297
aVthe beat it's picking up from the human,
p298
aVwhile also giving the human a sense that the robot knows what it's doing.
p299
aVAnd also how it changes the way it moves
p300
aVas soon as it starts its own solo.
p301
aa(lp302
V(Music)
p303
aa(lp304
VNow it's looking at me, showing that it's listening.
p305
aa(lp306
V(Music)
p307
aa(lp308
VNow look at the final chord of the piece again.
p309
aVAnd this time the robot communicates with its body
p310
aVwhen it's busy doing its own thing,
p311
aVand when it's ready to coordinate the final chord with me.
p312
aa(lp313
V(Music)
p314
aa(lp315
V(Music ending)
p316
aa(lp317
V(Final chord)
p318
aa(lp319
V(Applause)
p320
aa(lp321
VThanks.
p322
aVI hope you see
p323
aVhow much this part of the body that doesn't touch the instrument
p324
aVactually helps with the musical performance.
p325
aVAnd at some point \u2014 we are in Atlanta,
p326
aVso obviously some rapper will come into our lab at some point \u2014
p327
aVand we had this rapper come in and do a little jam with the robot.
p328
aVHere you can see the robot basically responding to the beat.
p329
aVNotice two things:
p330
aVone, how irresistible it is to join the robot while it's moving its head.
p331
aVYou kind of want to move your own head when it does it.
p332
aVAnd second, even though the rapper is really focused on his iPhone,
p333
aVas soon as the robot turns to him, he turns back.
p334
aVSo even though it's just in the periphery of his vision,
p335
aVin the corner of his eye, it's very powerful.
p336
aVAnd the reason is that we can't ignore
p337
aVphysical things moving in our environment.
p338
aVWe are wired for that.
p339
aVSo if you have a problem \u2014
p340
aVmaybe your partner is looking at their iPhone or smartphone too much \u2014
p341
aVyou might want to have a robot there to get their attention.
p342
aa(lp343
V(Laughter)
p344
aa(lp345
V(Music)
p346
aa(lp347
V(Music ends)
p348
aa(lp349
V(Applause)
p350
aa(lp351
VJust to introduce the last robot that we've worked on,
p352
aVit came out of something surprising that we found:
p353
aVSome point people didn't care about the robot being intelligent,
p354
aVable to improvise and listen,
p355
aVand do all these embodied intelligence things that I spent years developing.
p356
aVThey really liked that the robot was enjoying the music.
p357
aa(lp358
V(Laughter)
p359
aa(lp360
VAnd they didn't say the robot was moving to the music,
p361
aVthey said "enjoying" the music.
p362
aVAnd we thought, why don't we take this idea,
p363
aVand I designed a new piece of furniture.
p364
aVThis time it wasn't a desk lamp, it was a speaker dock,
p365
aVone of those things you plug your smartphone in.
p366
aVAnd I thought,
p367
aVwhat would happen if your speaker dock didn't just play the music for you,
p368
aVbut would actually enjoy it, too?
p369
aVAnd so again, here are some animation tests from an early stage.
p370
aa(lp371
V(Laughter)
p372
aa(lp373
VAnd this is what the final product looked like.
p374
aa(lp375
V(Music)
p376
aa(lp377
V(Music ends)
p378
aa(lp379
VSo, a lot of bobbing heads.
p380
aa(lp381
V(Applause)
p382
aa(lp383
VA lot of bobbing heads in the audience,
p384
aVso we can still see robots influence people.
p385
aVAnd it's not just fun and games.
p386
aa(lp387
VI think one of the reasons I care so much
p388
aVabout robots that use their body to communicate
p389
aVand use their body to move is \u2014
p390
aVI'm going to let you in on a little secret we roboticists are hiding \u2014
p391
aVis that every one of you is going to be living with a robot
p392
aVat some point in your life.
p393
aVSomewhere in your future, there will be a robot in your life.
p394
aVIf not in yours, your children's lives.
p395
aVAnd I want these robots to be more fluent, more engaging, more graceful
p396
aVthan currently they seem to be.
p397
aVAnd for that I think maybe robots need to be less like chess players
p398
aVand more like stage actors and more like musicians.
p399
aVMaybe they should be able to take chances and improvise.
p400
aVMaybe they should be able to anticipate what you're about to do.
p401
aVMaybe they even need to be able to make mistakes and correct them,
p402
aVbecause in the end, we are human.
p403
aVAnd maybe as humans, robots that are a little less than perfect
p404
aVare just perfect for us.
p405
aa(lp406
VThank you.
