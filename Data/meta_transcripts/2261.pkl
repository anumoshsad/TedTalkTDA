VI've learned some of my most important life lessons
p4
aVfrom drug dealers
p5
aVand gang members
p6
aVand prostitutes,
p7
aVand I've had some of my most profound theological conversations
p8
aVnot in the hallowed halls of a seminary
p9
aVbut on a street corner
p10
aVon a Friday night, at 1 a.m.
p11
aa(lp12
VThat's a little unusual, since I am a Baptist minister, seminary-trained,
p13
aVand pastored a church for over 20 years,
p14
aVbut it's true.
p15
aVIt came as a part of my participation
p16
aVin a public safety crime reduction strategy
p17
aVthat saw a 79 percent reduction in violent crime
p18
aVover an eight-year period in a major city.
p19
aa(lp20
VBut I didn't start out wanting to be
p21
aVa part of somebody's crime reduction strategy.
p22
aVI was 25, had my first church.
p23
aVIf you would have asked me what my ambition was,
p24
aVI would have told you I wanted to be a megachurch pastor.
p25
aVI wanted a 15-, 20,000-member church.
p26
aVI wanted my own television ministry.
p27
aVI wanted my own clothing line.
p28
aV(Laughter)
p29
aVI wanted to be your long distance carrier.
p30
aVYou know, the whole nine yards.
p31
aV(Laughter)
p32
aa(lp33
VAfter about a year of pastoring,
p34
aVmy membership went up about 20 members.
p35
aVSo megachurchdom was way down the road.
p36
aVBut seriously, if you'd have said, "What is your ambition?"
p37
aVI would have said just to be a good pastor,
p38
aVto be able to be with people through all the passages of life,
p39
aVto preach messages that would have an everyday meaning for folks,
p40
aVand in the African-American tradition,
p41
aVto be able to represent the community that I serve.
p42
aa(lp43
VBut there was something else that was happening in my city
p44
aVand in the entire metro area,
p45
aVand in most metro areas in the United States,
p46
aVand that was the homicide rate started to rise precipitously.
p47
aVAnd there were young people who were killing each other
p48
aVfor reasons that I thought were very trivial,
p49
aVlike bumping into someone in a high school hallway,
p50
aVand then after school, shooting the person.
p51
aVSomeone with the wrong color shirt on,
p52
aVon the wrong street corner at the wrong time.
p53
aVAnd something needed to be done about that.
p54
aVIt got to the point where it started to change the character of the city.
p55
aVYou could go to any housing project,
p56
aVfor example, like the one that was down the street from my church,
p57
aVand you would walk in, and it would be like a ghost town,
p58
aVbecause the parents wouldn't allow their kids to come out and play,
p59
aVeven in the summertime, because of the violence.
p60
aVYou would listen in the neighborhoods on any given night,
p61
aVand to the untrained ear, it sounded like fireworks,
p62
aVbut it was gunfire.
p63
aVYou'd hear it almost every night, when you were cooking dinner,
p64
aVtelling your child a bedtime story, or just watching TV.
p65
aVAnd you can go to any emergency room at any hospital,
p66
aVand you would see lying on gurneys
p67
aVyoung black and Latino men shot and dying.
p68
aVAnd I was doing funerals,
p69
aVbut not of the venerated matriarchs and patriarchs who'd lived a long life
p70
aVand there's a lot to say.
p71
aVI was doing funerals of 18-year-olds,
p72
aV17-year-olds,
p73
aVand 16-year-olds,
p74
aVand I was standing in a church or at a funeral home
p75
aVstruggling to say something
p76
aVthat would make some meaningful impact.
p77
aVAnd so while my colleagues were building these cathedrals great and tall
p78
aVand buying property outside of the city
p79
aVand moving their congregations out
p80
aVso that they could create or recreate their cities of God,
p81
aVthe social structures in the inner cities
p82
aVwere sagging under the weight of all of this violence.
p83
aa(lp84
VAnd so I stayed, because somebody needed to do something,
p85
aVand so I had looked at what I had and moved on that.
p86
aVI started to preach decrying the violence in the community.
p87
aVAnd I started to look at the programming in my church,
p88
aVand I started to build programs that would catch the at-risk youth,
p89
aVthose who were on the fence to the violence.
p90
aVI even tried to be innovative in my preaching.
p91
aVYou all have heard of rap music, right?
p92
aVRap music?
p93
aVI even tried to rap sermon one time.
p94
aVIt didn't work, but at least I tried it.
p95
aVI'll never forget the young person who came to me after that sermon.
p96
aVHe waited until everybody was gone,
p97
aVand he said, "Rev, rap sermon, huh?" And I was like, "Yeah, what do you think?"
p98
aVAnd he said, "Don't do that again, Rev."
p99
aV(Laughter)
p100
aa(lp101
VBut I preached and I built these programs,
p102
aVand I thought maybe if my colleagues did the same
p103
aVthat it would make a difference.
p104
aVBut the violence just careened out of control,
p105
aVand people who were not involved in the violence were getting shot and killed:
p106
aVsomebody going to buy a pack of cigarettes at a convenience store,
p107
aVor someone who was sitting at a bus stop just waiting for a bus,
p108
aVor kids who were playing in the park,
p109
aVoblivious to the violence on the other side of the park,
p110
aVbut it coming and visiting them.
p111
aVThings were out of control,
p112
aVand I didn't know what to do,
p113
aVand then something happened that changed everything for me.
p114
aVIt was a kid by the name of Jesse McKie,
p115
aVwalking home with his friend Rigoberto Carrion
p116
aVto the housing project down the street from my church.
p117
aVThey met up with a group of youth who were from a gang in Dorchester,
p118
aVand they were killed.
p119
aVBut as Jesse was running from the scene mortally wounded,
p120
aVhe was running in the direction of my church,
p121
aVand he died some 100, 150 yards away.
p122
aVIf he would have gotten to the church, it wouldn't have made a difference,
p123
aVbecause the lights were out; nobody was home.
p124
aVAnd I took that as a sign.
p125
aVWhen they caught some of the youth that had done this deed,
p126
aVto my surprise, they were around my age,
p127
aVbut the gulf that was between us was vast.
p128
aVIt was like we were in two completely different worlds.
p129
aa(lp130
VAnd so as I contemplated all of this
p131
aVand looked at what was happening,
p132
aVI suddenly realized that there was a paradox that was emerging inside of me,
p133
aVand the paradox was this: in all of those sermons
p134
aVthat I preached decrying the violence,
p135
aVI was also talking about building community,
p136
aVbut I suddenly realized
p137
aVthat there was a certain segment of the population
p138
aVthat I was not including in my definition of community.
p139
aVAnd so the paradox was this:
p140
aVIf I really wanted the community that I was preaching for,
p141
aVI needed to reach out
p142
aVand embrace this group that I had cut out of my definition.
p143
aVWhich meant not about building programs
p144
aVto catch those who were on the fences of violence,
p145
aVbut to reach out and to embrace those who were committing the acts of violence,
p146
aVthe gang bangers, the drug dealers.
p147
aa(lp148
VAs soon as I came to that realization, a quick question came to my mind.
p149
aVWhy me?
p150
aVI mean, isn't this a law enforcement issue?
p151
aVThis is why we have the police, right?
p152
aVAs soon as the question, "Why me?" came, the answer came just as quickly:
p153
aVWhy me? Because I'm the one who can't sleep at night thinking about it.
p154
aVBecause I'm the one looking around saying somebody needs to do something about this,
p155
aVand I'm starting to realize that that someone is me.
p156
aVI mean, isn't that how movements start anyway?
p157
aVThey don't start with a grand convention and people coming together
p158
aVand then walking in lockstep with a statement.
p159
aVBut it starts with just a few, or maybe just one.
p160
aa(lp161
VIt started with me that way,
p162
aVand so I decided to figure out the culture of violence
p163
aVin which these young people who were committing them existed,
p164
aVand I started to volunteer at the high school.
p165
aVAfter about two weeks of volunteering at the high school,
p166
aVI realized that the youth that I was trying to reach,
p167
aVthey weren't going to high school.
p168
aVI started to walk in the community,
p169
aVand it didn't take a rocket scientist to realize that they weren't out
p170
aVduring the day.
p171
aVSo I started to walk the streets at night, late at night,
p172
aVgoing into the parks where they were,
p173
aVbuilding the relationship that was necessary.
p174
aa(lp175
VA tragedy happened in Boston that brought a number of clergy together,
p176
aVand there was a small cadre of us who came to the realization
p177
aVthat we had to come out of the four walls of our sanctuary
p178
aVand meet the youth where they were,
p179
aVand not try to figure out how to bring them in.
p180
aVAnd so we decided to walk together,
p181
aVand we would get together
p182
aVin one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in the city
p183
aVon a Friday night and on a Saturday night
p184
aVat 10 p.m.,
p185
aVand we would walk until 2 or 3 in the morning.
p186
aVI imagine we were quite the anomaly when we first started walking.
p187
aVI mean, we weren't drug dealers.
p188
aVWe weren't drug customers.
p189
aVWe weren't the police. Some of us would have collars on.
p190
aVIt was probably a really odd thing.
p191
aVBut they started speaking to us after a while,
p192
aVand what we found out is that
p193
aVwhile we were walking, they were watching us,
p194
aVand they wanted to make sure of a couple of things:
p195
aVthat number one, we were going to be consistent in our behavior,
p196
aVthat we would keep coming out there;
p197
aVand then secondly, they had wanted to make sure
p198
aVthat we weren't out there to exploit them.
p199
aVBecause there was always somebody who would say,
p200
aV"We're going to take back the streets,"
p201
aVbut they would always seem to have a television camera with them,
p202
aVor a reporter,
p203
aVand they would enhance their own reputation
p204
aVto the detriment of those on the streets.
p205
aVSo when they saw that we had none of that,
p206
aVthey decided to talk to us.
p207
aVAnd then we did an amazing thing for preachers.
p208
aVWe decided to listen and not preach.
p209
aVCome on, give it up for me.
p210
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p211
aVAll right, come on, you're cutting into my time now, okay? (Laughter)
p212
aVBut it was amazing.
p213
aVWe said to them, "We don't know our own communities after 9 p.m. at night,
p214
aVbetween 9 p.m. and 5 a.m.,
p215
aVbut you do.
p216
aVYou are the subject matter experts, if you will, of that period of time.
p217
aVSo talk to us. Teach us.
p218
aVHelp us to see what we're not seeing.
p219
aVHelp us to understand what we're not understanding."
p220
aVAnd they were all too happy to do that,
p221
aVand we got an idea of what life on the streets was all about,
p222
aVvery different than what you see on the 11 o'clock news,
p223
aVvery different than what is portrayed in popular media and even social media.
p224
aa(lp225
VAnd as we were talking with them,
p226
aVa number of myths were dispelled about them with us.
p227
aVAnd one of the biggest myths was that these kids were cold and heartless
p228
aVand uncharacteristically bold in their violence.
p229
aVWhat we found out was the exact opposite.
p230
aVMost of the young people who were out there on the streets
p231
aVare just trying to make it on the streets.
p232
aVAnd we also found out
p233
aVthat some of the most intelligent and creative
p234
aVand magnificent and wise
p235
aVpeople that we've ever met
p236
aVwere on the street, engaged in a struggle.
p237
aVAnd I know some of them call it survival, but I call them overcomers,
p238
aVbecause when you're in the conditions that they're in,
p239
aVto be able to live every day is an accomplishment of overcoming.
p240
aVAnd as a result of that, we said to them,
p241
aV"How do you see this church, how do you see this institution
p242
aVhelping this situation?"
p243
aVAnd we developed a plan in conversation with these youths.
p244
aVWe stopped looking at them as the problem to be solved,
p245
aVand we started looking at them as partners, as assets,
p246
aVas co-laborers in the struggle to reduce violence in the community.
p247
aVImagine developing a plan,
p248
aVyou have one minister at one table and a heroin dealer at the other table,
p249
aVcoming up with a way in which the church can help the entire community.
p250
aa(lp251
VThe Boston Miracle was about bringing people together.
p252
aVWe had other partners.
p253
aVWe had law enforcement partners.
p254
aVWe had police officers.
p255
aVIt wasn't the entire force,
p256
aVbecause there were still some who still had that lock-'em-up mentality,
p257
aVbut there were other cops
p258
aVwho saw the honor in partnering with the community,
p259
aVwho saw the responsibility from themselves
p260
aVto be able to work as partners with community leaders and faith leaders
p261
aVin order to reduce violence in the community.
p262
aVSame with probation officers,
p263
aVsame with judges,
p264
aVsame with folks who were up that law enforcement chain,
p265
aVbecause they realized, like we did,
p266
aVthat we'll never arrest ourselves out of this situation,
p267
aVthat there will not be enough prosecutions made,
p268
aVand you cannot fill these jails up enough
p269
aVin order to alleviate the problem.
p270
aVI helped to start an organization
p271
aV20 years ago, a faith-based organization, to deal with this issue.
p272
aVI left it about four years ago
p273
aVand started working in cities across the United States,
p274
aV19 in total,
p275
aVand what I found out was that in those cities,
p276
aVthere was always this component of community leaders
p277
aVwho put their heads down and their nose to the grindstone,
p278
aVwho checked their egos at the door
p279
aVand saw the whole as greater than the sum of its parts,
p280
aVand came together and found ways to work with youth out on the streets,
p281
aVthat the solution is not more cops,
p282
aVbut the solution is mining the assets that are there in the community,
p283
aVto have a strong community component
p284
aVin the collaboration around violence reduction.
p285
aa(lp286
VNow, there is a movement in the United States
p287
aVof young people who I am very proud of who are dealing with the structural issues
p288
aVthat need to change if we're going to be a better society.
p289
aVBut there is this political ploy to try to pit police brutality
p290
aVand police misconduct against black-on-black violence.
p291
aVBut it's a fiction.
p292
aVIt's all connected.
p293
aVWhen you think about decades of failed housing policies
p294
aVand poor educational structures,
p295
aVwhen you think about persistent unemployment
p296
aVand underemployment in a community,
p297
aVwhen you think about poor healthcare,
p298
aVand then you throw drugs into the mix
p299
aVand duffel bags full of guns,
p300
aVlittle wonder that you would see this culture of violence emerge.
p301
aVAnd then the response that comes from the state is more cops
p302
aVand more suppression of hot spots.
p303
aVIt's all connected,
p304
aVand one of the wonderful things that we've been able to do
p305
aVis to be able to show the value of partnering together \u2014
p306
aVcommunity, law enforcement, private sector, the city \u2014
p307
aVin order to reduce violence.
p308
aVYou have to value that community component.
p309
aa(lp310
VI believe that we can end the era of violence in our cities.
p311
aVI believe that it is possible and that people are doing it even now.
p312
aVBut I need your help.
p313
aVIt can't just come from folks who are burning themselves out
p314
aVin the community.
p315
aVThey need support. They need help.
p316
aVGo back to your city.
p317
aVFind those people.
p318
aV"You need some help? I'll help you out."
p319
aVFind those people. They're there.
p320
aVBring them together with law enforcement, the private sector, and the city,
p321
aVwith the one aim of reducing violence,
p322
aVbut make sure that that community component is strong.
p323
aVBecause the old adage that comes from Burundi is right:
p324
aVthat you do for me, without me, you do to me.
p325
aa(lp326
VGod bless you. Thank you.
