VThis is a lot of ones and zeros.
p4
aVIt's what we call binary information.
p5
aVThis is how computers talk.
p6
aVIt's how they store information.
p7
aVIt's how computers think.
p8
aVIt's how computers do
p9
aVeverything it is that computers do.
p10
aVI'm a cybersecurity researcher,
p11
aVwhich means my job is to sit down with this information
p12
aVand try to make sense of it,
p13
aVto try to understand what all the ones and zeroes mean.
p14
aVUnfortunately for me, we're not just talking
p15
aVabout the ones and zeros I have on the screen here.
p16
aVWe're not just talking about a few pages of ones and zeros.
p17
aVWe're talking about billions and billions
p18
aVof ones and zeros,
p19
aVmore than anyone could possibly comprehend.
p20
aa(lp21
VNow, as exciting as that sounds,
p22
aVwhen I first started doing cyber \u2014
p23
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p24
aVwhen I first started doing cyber, I wasn't sure
p25
aVthat sifting through ones and zeros
p26
aVwas what I wanted to do with the rest of my life,
p27
aVbecause in my mind, cyber
p28
aVwas keeping viruses off of my grandma's computer,
p29
aVit was keeping people's Myspace pages from being hacked,
p30
aVand maybe, maybe on my most glorious day,
p31
aVit was keeping someone's credit card information from being stolen.
p32
aVThose are important things,
p33
aVbut that's not how I wanted to spend my life.
p34
aa(lp35
VBut after 30 minutes of work
p36
aVas a defense contractor,
p37
aVI soon found out that my idea of cyber
p38
aVwas a little bit off.
p39
aVIn fact, in terms of national security,
p40
aVkeeping viruses off of my grandma's computer
p41
aVwas surprisingly low on their priority list.
p42
aVAnd the reason for that is cyber
p43
aVis so much bigger than any one of those things.
p44
aVCyber is an integral part of all of our lives,
p45
aVbecause computers are an integral part of all of our lives,
p46
aVeven if you don't own a computer.
p47
aVComputers control everything in your car,
p48
aVfrom your GPS to your airbags.
p49
aVThey control your phone.
p50
aVThey're the reason you can call 911
p51
aVand get someone on the other line.
p52
aVThey control our nation's entire infrastructure.
p53
aVThey're the reason you have electricity,
p54
aVheat, clean water, food.
p55
aVComputers control our military equipment,
p56
aVeverything from missile silos to satellites
p57
aVto nuclear defense networks.
p58
aVAll of these things are made possible
p59
aVbecause of computers,
p60
aVand therefore because of cyber,
p61
aVand when something goes wrong,
p62
aVcyber can make all of these things impossible.
p63
aa(lp64
VBut that's where I step in.
p65
aVA big part of my job is defending all of these things,
p66
aVkeeping them working,
p67
aVbut once in a while, part of my job is to break one of these things,
p68
aVbecause cyber isn't just about defense,
p69
aVit's also about offense.
p70
aVWe're entering an age where we talk about
p71
aVcyberweapons.
p72
aVIn fact, so great is the potential for cyber offense
p73
aVthat cyber is considered a new domain of warfare.
p74
aVWarfare.
p75
aVIt's not necessarily a bad thing.
p76
aVOn the one hand, it means we have whole new front
p77
aVon which we need to defend ourselves,
p78
aVbut on the other hand,
p79
aVit means we have a whole new way to attack,
p80
aVa whole new way to stop evil people
p81
aVfrom doing evil things.
p82
aa(lp83
VSo let's consider an example of this
p84
aVthat's completely theoretical.
p85
aVSuppose a terrorist wants to blow up a building,
p86
aVand he wants to do this again and again
p87
aVin the future.
p88
aVSo he doesn't want to be in that building when it explodes.
p89
aVHe's going to use a cell phone
p90
aVas a remote detonator.
p91
aVNow, it used to be the only way we had
p92
aVto stop this terrorist
p93
aVwas with a hail of bullets and a car chase,
p94
aVbut that's not necessarily true anymore.
p95
aVWe're entering an age where we can stop him
p96
aVwith the press of a button
p97
aVfrom 1,000 miles away,
p98
aVbecause whether he knew it or not,
p99
aVas soon as he decided to use his cell phone,
p100
aVhe stepped into the realm of cyber.
p101
aVA well-crafted cyber attack could break into his phone,
p102
aVdisable the overvoltage protections on his battery,
p103
aVdrastically overload the circuit,
p104
aVcause the battery to overheat, and explode.
p105
aVNo more phone, no more detonator,
p106
aVmaybe no more terrorist,
p107
aVall with the press of a button
p108
aVfrom a thousand miles away.
p109
aa(lp110
VSo how does this work?
p111
aVIt all comes back to those ones and zeros.
p112
aVBinary information makes your phone work,
p113
aVand used correctly, it can make your phone explode.
p114
aVSo when you start to look at cyber from this perspective,
p115
aVspending your life sifting through binary information
p116
aVstarts to seem kind of exciting.
p117
aa(lp118
VBut here's the catch: This is hard,
p119
aVreally, really hard,
p120
aVand here's why.
p121
aVThink about everything you have on your cell phone.
p122
aVYou've got the pictures you've taken.
p123
aVYou've got the music you listen to.
p124
aVYou've got your contacts list,
p125
aVyour email, and probably 500 apps
p126
aVyou've never used in your entire life,
p127
aVand behind all of this is the software, the code,
p128
aVthat controls your phone,
p129
aVand somewhere, buried inside of that code,
p130
aVis a tiny piece that controls your battery,
p131
aVand that's what I'm really after,
p132
aVbut all of this, just a bunch of ones and zeros,
p133
aVand it's all just mixed together.
p134
aVIn cyber, we call this finding a needle in a stack of needles,
p135
aVbecause everything pretty much looks alike.
p136
aVI'm looking for one key piece,
p137
aVbut it just blends in with everything else.
p138
aa(lp139
VSo let's step back from this theoretical situation
p140
aVof making a terrorist's phone explode,
p141
aVand look at something that actually happened to me.
p142
aVPretty much no matter what I do,
p143
aVmy job always starts with sitting down
p144
aVwith a whole bunch of binary information,
p145
aVand I'm always looking for one key piece
p146
aVto do something specific.
p147
aVIn this case, I was looking for a very advanced,
p148
aVvery high-tech piece of code
p149
aVthat I knew I could hack,
p150
aVbut it was somewhere buried
p151
aVinside of a billion ones and zeroes.
p152
aVUnfortunately for me, I didn't know
p153
aVquite what I was looking for.
p154
aVI didn't know quite what it would look like,
p155
aVwhich makes finding it really, really hard.
p156
aVWhen I have to do that, what I have to do
p157
aVis basically look at various pieces
p158
aVof this binary information,
p159
aVtry to decipher each piece, and see if it might be
p160
aVwhat I'm after.
p161
aVSo after a while, I thought I had found the piece
p162
aVI was looking for.
p163
aVI thought maybe this was it.
p164
aVIt seemed to be about right, but I couldn't quite tell.
p165
aVI couldn't tell what those ones and zeros represented.
p166
aVSo I spent some time trying to put this together,
p167
aVbut wasn't having a whole lot of luck,
p168
aVand finally I decided,
p169
aVI'm going to get through this,
p170
aVI'm going to come in on a weekend,
p171
aVand I'm not going to leave
p172
aVuntil I figure out what this represents.
p173
aVSo that's what I did. I came in on a Saturday morning,
p174
aVand about 10 hours in, I sort of had all the pieces to the puzzle.
p175
aVI just didn't know how they fit together.
p176
aVI didn't know what these ones and zeros meant.
p177
aVAt the 15-hour mark,
p178
aVI started to get a better picture of what was there,
p179
aVbut I had a creeping suspicion
p180
aVthat what I was looking at
p181
aVwas not at all related to what I was looking for.
p182
aVBy 20 hours, the pieces started to come together
p183
aVvery slowly \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p184
aVand I was pretty sure I was going down
p185
aVthe wrong path at this point,
p186
aVbut I wasn't going to give up.
p187
aVAfter 30 hours in the lab,
p188
aVI figured out exactly what I was looking at,
p189
aVand I was right, it wasn't what I was looking for.
p190
aVI spent 30 hours piecing together
p191
aVthe ones and zeros that formed a picture of a kitten.
p192
aV(Laughter)
p193
aVI wasted 30 hours of my life searching for this kitten
p194
aVthat had nothing at all to do
p195
aVwith what I was trying to accomplish.
p196
aa(lp197
VSo I was frustrated, I was exhausted.
p198
aVAfter 30 hours in the lab, I probably smelled horrible.
p199
aVBut instead of just going home
p200
aVand calling it quits, I took a step back
p201
aVand asked myself, what went wrong here?
p202
aVHow could I make such a stupid mistake?
p203
aVI'm really pretty good at this.
p204
aVI do this for a living.
p205
aVSo what happened?
p206
aVWell I thought, when you're looking at information at this level,
p207
aVit's so easy to lose track of what you're doing.
p208
aVIt's easy to not see the forest through the trees.
p209
aVIt's easy to go down the wrong rabbit hole
p210
aVand waste a tremendous amount of time
p211
aVdoing the wrong thing.
p212
aVBut I had this epiphany.
p213
aVWe were looking at the data completely incorrectly
p214
aVsince day one.
p215
aVThis is how computers think, ones and zeros.
p216
aVIt's not how people think,
p217
aVbut we've been trying to adapt our minds
p218
aVto think more like computers
p219
aVso that we can understand this information.
p220
aVInstead of trying to make our minds fit the problem,
p221
aVwe should have been making the problem
p222
aVfit our minds,
p223
aVbecause our brains have a tremendous potential
p224
aVfor analyzing huge amounts of information,
p225
aVjust not like this.
p226
aVSo what if we could unlock that potential
p227
aVjust by translating this
p228
aVto the right kind of information?
p229
aVSo with these ideas in mind,
p230
aVI sprinted out of my basement lab at work
p231
aVto my basement lab at home,
p232
aVwhich looked pretty much the same.
p233
aVThe main difference is, at work,
p234
aVI'm surrounded by cyber materials,
p235
aVand cyber seemed to be the problem in this situation.
p236
aVAt home, I'm surrounded by everything else I've ever learned.
p237
aVSo I poured through every book I could find,
p238
aVevery idea I'd ever encountered,
p239
aVto see how could we translate a problem
p240
aVfrom one domain to something completely different?
p241
aa(lp242
VThe biggest question was,
p243
aVwhat do we want to translate it to?
p244
aVWhat do our brains do perfectly naturally
p245
aVthat we could exploit?
p246
aVMy answer was vision.
p247
aVWe have a tremendous capability to analyze visual information.
p248
aVWe can combine color gradients, depth cues,
p249
aVall sorts of these different signals
p250
aVinto one coherent picture of the world around us.
p251
aVThat's incredible.
p252
aVSo if we could find a way to translate
p253
aVthese binary patterns to visual signals,
p254
aVwe could really unlock the power of our brains
p255
aVto process this stuff.
p256
aVSo I started looking at the binary information,
p257
aVand I asked myself, what do I do
p258
aVwhen I first encounter something like this?
p259
aVAnd the very first thing I want to do,
p260
aVthe very first question I want to answer,
p261
aVis what is this?
p262
aVI don't care what it does, how it works.
p263
aVAll I want to know is, what is this?
p264
aVAnd the way I can figure that out
p265
aVis by looking at chunks,
p266
aVsequential chunks of binary information,
p267
aVand I look at the relationships between those chunks.
p268
aVWhen I gather up enough of these sequences,
p269
aVI begin to get an idea of exactly
p270
aVwhat this information must be.
p271
aVSo let's go back to that
p272
aVblow up the terrorist's phone situation.
p273
aVThis is what English text looks like
p274
aVat a binary level.
p275
aVThis is what your contacts list would look like
p276
aVif I were examining it.
p277
aVIt's really hard to analyze this at this level,
p278
aVbut if we take those same binary chunks
p279
aVthat I would be trying to find,
p280
aVand instead translate that
p281
aVto a visual representation,
p282
aVtranslate those relationships,
p283
aVthis is what we get.
p284
aVThis is what English text looks like
p285
aVfrom a visual abstraction perspective.
p286
aVAll of a sudden,
p287
aVit shows us all the same information
p288
aVthat was in the ones and zeros,
p289
aVbut show us it in an entirely different way,
p290
aVa way that we can immediately comprehend.
p291
aVWe can instantly see all of the patterns here.
p292
aVIt takes me seconds to pick out patterns here,
p293
aVbut hours, days, to pick them out
p294
aVin ones and zeros.
p295
aVIt takes minutes for anybody to learn
p296
aVwhat these patterns represent here,
p297
aVbut years of experience in cyber
p298
aVto learn what those same patterns represent
p299
aVin ones and zeros.
p300
aVSo this piece is caused by
p301
aVlower case letters followed by lower case letters
p302
aVinside of that contact list.
p303
aVThis is upper case by upper case,
p304
aVupper case by lower case, lower case by upper case.
p305
aVThis is caused by spaces. This is caused by carriage returns.
p306
aVWe can go through every little detail
p307
aVof the binary information in seconds,
p308
aVas opposed to weeks, months, at this level.
p309
aVThis is what an image looks like
p310
aVfrom your cell phone.
p311
aVBut this is what it looks like
p312
aVin a visual abstraction.
p313
aVThis is what your music looks like,
p314
aVbut here's its visual abstraction.
p315
aVMost importantly for me,
p316
aVthis is what the code on your cell phone looks like.
p317
aVThis is what I'm after in the end,
p318
aVbut this is its visual abstraction.
p319
aVIf I can find this, I can't make the phone explode.
p320
aVI could spend weeks trying to find this
p321
aVin ones and zeros,
p322
aVbut it takes me seconds to pick out
p323
aVa visual abstraction like this.
p324
aa(lp325
VOne of those most remarkable parts about all of this
p326
aVis it gives us an entirely new way to understand
p327
aVnew information, stuff that we haven't seen before.
p328
aVSo I know what English looks like at a binary level,
p329
aVand I know what its visual abstraction looks like,
p330
aVbut I've never seen Russian binary in my entire life.
p331
aVIt would take me weeks just to figure out
p332
aVwhat I was looking at from raw ones and zeros,
p333
aVbut because our brains can instantly pick up
p334
aVand recognize these subtle patterns inside
p335
aVof these visual abstractions,
p336
aVwe can unconsciously apply those
p337
aVin new situations.
p338
aVSo this is what Russian looks like
p339
aVin a visual abstraction.
p340
aVBecause I know what one language looks like,
p341
aVI can recognize other languages
p342
aVeven when I'm not familiar with them.
p343
aVThis is what a photograph looks like,
p344
aVbut this is what clip art looks like.
p345
aVThis is what the code on your phone looks like,
p346
aVbut this is what the code on your computer looks like.
p347
aVOur brains can pick up on these patterns
p348
aVin ways that we never could have
p349
aVfrom looking at raw ones and zeros.
p350
aVBut we've really only scratched the surface
p351
aVof what we can do with this approach.
p352
aVWe've only begun to unlock the capabilities
p353
aVof our minds to process visual information.
p354
aVIf we take those same concepts and translate them
p355
aVinto three dimensions instead,
p356
aVwe find entirely new ways of making sense of information.
p357
aVIn seconds, we can pick out every pattern here.
p358
aVwe can see the cross associated with code.
p359
aVWe can see cubes associated with text.
p360
aVWe can even pick up the tiniest visual artifacts.
p361
aVThings that would take us weeks,
p362
aVmonths to find in ones and zeroes,
p363
aVare immediately apparent
p364
aVin some sort of visual abstraction,
p365
aVand as we continue to go through this
p366
aVand throw more and more information at it,
p367
aVwhat we find is that we're capable of processing
p368
aVbillions of ones and zeros
p369
aVin a matter of seconds
p370
aVjust by using our brain's built-in ability
p371
aVto analyze patterns.
p372
aa(lp373
VSo this is really nice and helpful,
p374
aVbut all this tells me is what I'm looking at.
p375
aVSo at this point, based on visual patterns,
p376
aVI can find the code on the phone.
p377
aVBut that's not enough to blow up a battery.
p378
aVThe next thing I need to find is the code
p379
aVthat controls the battery, but we're back
p380
aVto the needle in a stack of needles problem.
p381
aVThat code looks pretty much like all the other code
p382
aVon that system.
p383
aa(lp384
VSo I might not be able to find the code that controls the battery,
p385
aVbut there's a lot of things that are very similar to that.
p386
aVYou have code that controls your screen,
p387
aVthat controls your buttons, that controls your microphones,
p388
aVso even if I can't find the code for the battery,
p389
aVI bet I can find one of those things.
p390
aVSo the next step in my binary analysis process
p391
aVis to look at pieces of information
p392
aVthat are similar to each other.
p393
aVIt's really, really hard to do at a binary level,
p394
aVbut if we translate those similarities to a visual abstraction instead,
p395
aVI don't even have to sift through the raw data.
p396
aVAll I have to do is wait for the image to light up
p397
aVto see when I'm at similar pieces.
p398
aVI follow these strands of similarity like a trail of bread crumbs
p399
aVto find exactly what I'm looking for.
p400
aa(lp401
VSo at this point in the process,
p402
aVI've located the code
p403
aVresponsible for controlling your battery,
p404
aVbut that's still not enough to blow up a phone.
p405
aVThe last piece of the puzzle
p406
aVis understanding how that code
p407
aVcontrols your battery.
p408
aVFor this, I need to identify
p409
aVvery subtle, very detailed relationships
p410
aVwithin that binary information,
p411
aVanother very hard thing to do
p412
aVwhen looking at ones and zeros.
p413
aVBut if we translate that information
p414
aVinto a physical representation,
p415
aVwe can sit back and let our visual cortex do all the hard work.
p416
aVIt can find all the detailed patterns,
p417
aVall the important pieces, for us.
p418
aVIt can find out exactly how the pieces of that code
p419
aVwork together to control that battery.
p420
aVAll of this can be done in a matter of hours,
p421
aVwhereas the same process
p422
aVwould have taken months in the past.
p423
aa(lp424
VThis is all well and good
p425
aVin a theoretical blow up a terrorist's phone situation.
p426
aVI wanted to find out if this would really work
p427
aVin the work I do every day.
p428
aVSo I was playing around with these same concepts
p429
aVwith some of the data I've looked at in the past,
p430
aVand yet again, I was trying to find
p431
aVa very detailed, specific piece of code
p432
aVinside of a massive piece of binary information.
p433
aVSo I looked at it at this level,
p434
aVthinking I was looking at the right thing,
p435
aVonly to see this doesn't have
p436
aVthe connectivity I would have expected
p437
aVfor the code I was looking for.
p438
aVIn fact, I'm not really sure what this is,
p439
aVbut when I stepped back a level
p440
aVand looked at the similarities within the code
p441
aVI saw, this doesn't have similarities
p442
aVlike any code that exists out there.
p443
aVI can't even be looking at code.
p444
aVIn fact, from this perspective,
p445
aVI could tell, this isn't code.
p446
aVThis is an image of some sort.
p447
aVAnd from here, I can see,
p448
aVit's not just an image, this is a photograph.
p449
aVNow that I know it's a photograph,
p450
aVI've got dozens of other binary translation techniques
p451
aVto visualize and understand that information,
p452
aVso in a matter of seconds, we can take this information,
p453
aVshove it through a dozen other visual translation techniques
p454
aVin order to find out exactly what we were looking at.
p455
aVI saw \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p456
aVit was that darn kitten again.
p457
aVAll this is enabled
p458
aVbecause we were able to find a way
p459
aVto translate a very hard problem
p460
