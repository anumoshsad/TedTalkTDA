VI just came back from a community
p4
aVthat holds the secret to human survival.
p5
aVIt's a place where women run the show,
p6
aVhave sex to say hello,
p7
aVand play rules the day \u2014
p8
aVwhere fun is serious business.
p9
aVAnd no, this isn't Burning Man
p10
aVor San Francisco.
p11
aV(Laughter)
p12
aVLadies and gentlemen, meet your cousins.
p13
aVThis is the world of wild bonobos
p14
aVin the jungles of Congo.
p15
aVBonobos are, together with chimpanzees,
p16
aVyour living closest relative.
p17
aVThat means we all share a common ancestor,
p18
aVan evolutionary grandmother,
p19
aVwho lived around six million years ago.
p20
aVNow, chimpanzees are well-known
p21
aVfor their aggression.
p22
aa(lp23
V(Laughter)
p24
aa(lp25
VBut unfortunately,
p26
aVwe have made too much of an emphasis
p27
aVof this aspect
p28
aVin our narratives of human evolution.
p29
aVBut bonobos show us
p30
aVthe other side of the coin.
p31
aVWhile chimpanzees
p32
aVare dominated by big, scary guys,
p33
aVbonobo society
p34
aVis run by empowered females.
p35
aVThese guys have really worked something out,
p36
aVsince this leads to a highly tolerant society
p37
aVwhere fatal violence
p38
aVhas not been observed yet.
p39
aVBut unfortunately,
p40
aVbonobos are the least understood
p41
aVof the great apes.
p42
aVThey live in the depths of the Congolese jungle,
p43
aVand it has been very difficult to study them.
p44
aa(lp45
VThe Congo is a paradox \u2014
p46
aVa land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty,
p47
aVbut also the heart of darkness itself \u2014
p48
aVthe scene of a violent conflict
p49
aVthat has raged for decades
p50
aVand claimed nearly as many lives
p51
aVas the First World War.
p52
aVNot surprisingly,
p53
aVthis destruction also endangers bonobo survival.
p54
aVBushmeat trades and forest loss
p55
aVmeans we couldn't fill a small stadium
p56
aVwith all the bonobos that are left in the world \u2014
p57
aVand we're not even sure of that to be honest.
p58
aVYet, in this land of violence and chaos,
p59
aVyou can hear hidden laughter
p60
aVswaying the trees.
p61
aa(lp62
VWho are these cousins?
p63
aVWe know them as the "make love, not war" apes
p64
aVsince they have frequent, promiscuous
p65
aVand bisexual sex
p66
aVto manage conflict
p67
aVand solve social issues.
p68
aVNow, I'm not saying this is the solution
p69
aVto all of humanity's problems \u2014
p70
aVsince there's more to bonobo life
p71
aVthan the Kama Sutra.
p72
aVBonobos, like humans,
p73
aVlove to play throughout their entire lives.
p74
aVPlay is not just child's games.
p75
aVFor us and them,
p76
aVplay is foundational for bonding relationships
p77
aVand fostering tolerance.
p78
aVIt's where we learn to trust
p79
aVand where we learn about the rules of the game.
p80
aVPlay increases creativity
p81
aVand resilience,
p82
aVand it's all about the generation of diversity \u2014
p83
aVdiversity of interactions,
p84
aVdiversity of behaviors,
p85
aVdiversity of connections.
p86
aVAnd when you watch bonobo play,
p87
aVyou're seeing the very evolutionary roots
p88
aVof human laughter, dance
p89
aVand ritual.
p90
aVPlay is the glue
p91
aVthat binds us together.
p92
aa(lp93
VNow, I don't know how you play,
p94
aVbut I want to show you a couple of unique clips
p95
aVfresh from the wild.
p96
aVFirst, it's a ball game bonobo-style \u2014
p97
aVand I do not mean football.
p98
aVSo here,
p99
aVwe have a young female and a male
p100
aVengaged in a chase game.
p101
aVHave a look what she's doing.
p102
aVIt might be the evolutionary origin of the phrase,
p103
aV"she's got him by the balls."
p104
aV(Laughter)
p105
aVOnly I think that he's rather loving it here, right?
p106
aVYeah.
p107
aV(Laughter)
p108
aVSo sex play is common
p109
aVin both bonobos and humans.
p110
aVAnd this video is really interesting
p111
aVbecause it shows \u2014
p112
aVthis video's really interesting
p113
aVbecause it shows the inventiveness
p114
aVof bringing unusual elements into play \u2014
p115
aVsuch as testicles \u2014
p116
aVand also how play both requires trust
p117
aVand fosters trust \u2014
p118
aVwhile at the same time being tremendous fun.
p119
aa(lp120
VBut play's a shapeshifter.
p121
aV(Laughter)
p122
aVPlay's a shapeshifter,
p123
aVand it can take many forms,
p124
aVsome of which are more quiet,
p125
aVimaginative, curious \u2014
p126
aVmaybe where wonder is discovered anew.
p127
aVAnd I want you to see,
p128
aVthis is Fuku, a young female,
p129
aVand she is quietly playing with water.
p130
aVI think, like her,
p131
aVwe sometimes play alone,
p132
aVand we explore the boundaries
p133
aVof our inner and our outer worlds.
p134
aVAnd it's that playful curiosity
p135
aVthat drives us to explore, drives us to interact,
p136
aVand then the unexpected connections we form
p137
aVare the real hotbed for creativity.
p138
aa(lp139
VSo these are just small tasters
p140
aVinto the insights that bonobo give us
p141
aVto our past and present.
p142
aVBut they also hold a secret for our future,
p143
aVa future where we need to adapt
p144
aVto an increasingly challenging world
p145
aVthrough greater creativity
p146
aVand greater cooperation.
p147
aVThe secret is that play is the key
p148
aVto these capacities.
p149
aVIn other words,
p150
aVplay is our adaptive wildcard.
p151
aVIn order to adapt successfully
p152
aVto a changing world,
p153
aVwe need to play.
p154
aVBut will we make the most of our playfulness?
p155
aVPlay is not frivolous.
p156
aVPlay's essential.
p157
aVFor bonobos and humans alike,
p158
aVlife is not just red in tooth and claw.
p159
aVIn times when it seems least appropriate to play,
p160
aVit might be the times when it is most urgent.
p161
aa(lp162
VAnd so, my fellow primates,
p163
aVlet us embrace this gift from evolution
p164
aVand play together,
p165
aVas we rediscover creativity,
p166
aVfellowship and wonder.
p167
aa(lp168
VThank you.
