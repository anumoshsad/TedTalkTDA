VWe're going to begin in 1964.
p4
aVBob Dylan is 23 years old, and his career
p5
aVis just reaching its pinnacle.
p6
aVHe's been christened the voice of a generation,
p7
aVand he's churning out classic songs
p8
aVat a seemingly impossible rate,
p9
aVbut there's a small minority of dissenters, and they claim
p10
aVthat Bob Dylan is stealing other people's songs.
p11
aa(lp12
V2004. Brian Burton, aka Danger Mouse,
p13
aVtakes the Beatles' "White Album,"
p14
aVcombines it with Jay-Z's "The Black Album"
p15
aVto create "The Grey Album."
p16
aV"The Grey Album" becomes an immediate sensation online,
p17
aVand the Beatles' record company sends out countless
p18
aVcease-and-desist letters for "unfair competition
p19
aVand dilution of our valuable property."
p20
aa(lp21
VNow, "The Grey Album" is a remix.
p22
aVIt is new media created from old media.
p23
aVIt was made using these three techniques:
p24
aVcopy, transform and combine.
p25
aVIt's how you remix. You take existing songs,
p26
aVyou chop them up, you transform the pieces,
p27
aVyou combine them back together again,
p28
aVand you've got a new song, but that new song
p29
aVis clearly comprised of old songs.
p30
aa(lp31
VBut I think these aren't just the components of remixing.
p32
aVI think these are the basic elements of all creativity.
p33
aVI think everything is a remix,
p34
aVand I think this is a better way to conceive of creativity.
p35
aa(lp36
VAll right, let's head back to 1964, and let's hear
p37
aVwhere some of Dylan's early songs came from.
p38
aVWe'll do some side-by-side comparisons here.
p39
aa(lp40
VAll right, this first song you're going to hear
p41
aVis "Nottamun Town." It's a traditional folk tune.
p42
aVAfter that, you'll hear Dylan's "Masters of War."
p43
aa(lp44
VJean Ritchie: \u266b In Nottamun Town, not a soul would look out, \u266b
p45
aa(lp46
V\u266b not a soul would look up, not a soul would look down. \u266b
p47
aa(lp48
VBob Dylan: \u266b Come you masters of war, \u266b
p49
aa(lp50
V\u266b you that build the big guns, you that build the death planes, \u266b
p51
aa(lp52
V\u266b You that build all the bombs. \u266b
p53
aa(lp54
VKirby Ferguson: Okay, so that's the same basic melody
p55
aVand overall structure. This next one is "The Patriot Game,"
p56
aVby Dominic Behan. Alongside that,
p57
aVyou're going to hear "With God on Our Side," by Dylan.
p58
aa(lp59
VDominic Behan: \u266b Come all ye young rebels, \u266b
p60
aa(lp61
V\u266b and list while I sing, \u266b
p62
aa(lp63
V\u266b for the love of one's land is a terrible thing. \u266b
p64
aa(lp65
VBD: \u266b Oh my name it is nothin', \u266b
p66
aa(lp67
V\u266b my age it means less, \u266b
p68
aa(lp69
V\u266b the country I come from is called the Midwest. \u266b
p70
aa(lp71
VKF: Okay, so in this case, Dylan admits
p72
aVhe must have heard "The Patriot Game," he forgot about it,
p73
aVthen when the song kind of bubbled back up
p74
aVin his brain, he just thought it was his song.
p75
aa(lp76
VLast one, this is "Who's Going To Buy You Ribbons,"
p77
aVanother traditional folk tune.
p78
aVAlongside that is "Don't Think Twice, It's All Right."
p79
aVThis one's more about the lyric.
p80
aa(lp81
VPaul Clayton: \u266b It ain't no use to sit and sigh now, \u266b
p82
aa(lp83
V\u266b darlin', and it ain't no use to sit and cry now. \u266b
p84
aa(lp85
VBD: \u266b It ain\u2019t no use to sit and wonder why, babe, \u266b
p86
aa(lp87
V\u266b if you don't know by now, \u266b
p88
aa(lp89
V\u266b and it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe, \u266b
p90
aa(lp91
V\u266b it'll never do somehow. \u266b
p92
aa(lp93
VKF: Okay, now, there's a lot of these.
p94
aVIt's been estimated that two thirds of the melodies
p95
aVDylan used in his early songs were borrowed.
p96
aVThis is pretty typical among folk singers.
p97
aVHere's the advice of Dylan's idol, Woody Guthrie.
p98
aa(lp99
V"The worlds are the important thing.
p100
aVDon't worry about tunes. Take a tune,
p101
aVsing high when they sing low,
p102
aVsing fast when they sing slow, and you've got a new tune."
p103
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p104
aVAnd that's, that's what Guthrie did right here,
p105
aVand I'm sure you all recognize the results.
p106
aV(Music)
p107
aVWe know this tune, right? We know it?
p108
aVActually you don't.
p109
aVThat is "When the World's on Fire," a very old melody,
p110
aVin this case performed by the Carter Family.
p111
aVGuthrie adapted it into "This Land Is Your Land."
p112
aVSo, Bob Dylan, like all folk singers, he copied melodies,
p113
aVhe transformed them, he combined them with new lyrics
p114
aVwhich were frequently their own concoction
p115
aVof previous stuff.
p116
aa(lp117
VNow, American copyright and patent laws run counter
p118
aVto this notion that we build on the work of others.
p119
aVInstead, these laws and laws around the world
p120
aVuse the rather awkward analogy of property.
p121
aVNow, creative works may indeed be kind of like property,
p122
aVbut it's property that we're all building on,
p123
aVand creations can only take root and grow
p124
aVonce that ground has been prepared.
p125
aa(lp126
VHenry Ford once said, "I invented nothing new.
p127
aVI simply assembled the discoveries of other men
p128
aVbehind whom were centuries of work.
p129
aVProgress happens when all the factors that make for it
p130
aVare ready and then it is inevitable."
p131
aa(lp132
V2007. The iPhone makes it debut.
p133
aVApple undoubtedly brings this innovation to us early,
p134
aVbut its time was approaching because its core technology
p135
aVhad been evolving for decades.
p136
aVThat's multi-touch, controlling a device
p137
aVby touching its display.
p138
aVHere is Steve Jobs introducing multi-touch
p139
aVand making a rather foreboding joke.
p140
aa(lp141
VSteve Jobs: And we have invented a new technology
p142
aVcalled multi-touch.
p143
aVYou can do multi-fingered gestures on it,
p144
aVand boy have we patented it. (Laughter)
p145
aVKF: Yes. And yet, here is multi-touch in action.
p146
aVThis is at TED, actually, about a year earlier.
p147
aVThis is Jeff Han, and, I mean, that's multi-touch.
p148
aVIt's the same animal, at least.
p149
aVLet's hear what Jeff Han has to say about this
p150
aVnewfangled technology.
p151
aVJeff Han: Multi-touch sensing isn't anything \u2014
p152
aVisn't completely new. I mean, people like Bill Buxton
p153
aVhave been playing around with it in the '80s.
p154
aVThe technology, you know, isn't the most exciting thing here
p155
aVright now other than probably its newfound accessibility.
p156
aVKF: So he's pretty frank about it not being new.
p157
aVSo it's not multi-touch as a whole that's patented.
p158
aVIt's the small parts of it that are,
p159
aVand it's in these small details where
p160
aVwe can clearly see patent law contradicting its intent:
p161
aVto promote the progress of useful arts.
p162
aa(lp163
VHere is the first ever slide-to-unlock.
p164
aVThat is all there is to it. Apple has patented this.
p165
aVIt's a 28-page software patent, but I will summarize
p166
aVwhat it covers. Spoiler alert: Unlocking your phone
p167
aVby sliding an icon with your finger. (Laughter)
p168
aVI'm only exaggerating a little bit. It's a broad patent.
p169
aa(lp170
VNow, can someone own this idea?
p171
aVNow, back in the '80s, there were no software patents,
p172
aVand it was Xerox that pioneered the graphical user interface.
p173
aVWhat if they had patented pop-up menus,
p174
aVscrollbars, the desktop with icons that look like folders
p175
aVand sheets of paper?
p176
aVWould a young and inexperienced Apple
p177
aVhave survived the legal assault from a much larger
p178
aVand more mature company like Xerox?
p179
aa(lp180
VNow, this idea that everything is a remix might sound
p181
aVlike common sense until you're the one getting remixed.
p182
aVFor example ...
p183
aVSJ: I mean, Picasso had a saying.
p184
aVHe said, "Good artists copy. Great artists steal."
p185
aVAnd we have, you know,
p186
aValways been shameless about stealing great ideas.
p187
aVKF: Okay, so that's in '96. Here's in 2010.
p188
aV"I'm going to destroy Android because it's a stolen product."
p189
aV(Laughter)
p190
aV"I'm willing to go thermonuclear war on this." (Laughter)
p191
aVOkay, so in other words, great artists steal, but not from me.
p192
aV(Laughter)
p193
aa(lp194
VNow, behavioral economists might refer to this sort of thing as loss aversion
p195
aVWe have a strong predisposition towards protecting
p196
aVwhat we feel is ours.
p197
aVWe have no such aversion towards copying
p198
aVwhat other people have, because we do that nonstop.
p199
aa(lp200
VSo here's the sort of equation we're looking at.
p201
aVWe've got laws that fundamentally treat creative works as property,
p202
aVplus massive rewards or settlements
p203
aVin infringement cases, plus huge legal fees
p204
aVto protect yourself in court,
p205
aVplus cognitive biases against perceived loss.
p206
aVAnd the sum looks like this.
p207
aVThat is the last four years of lawsuits
p208
aVin the realm of smartphones.
p209
aVIs this promoting the progress of useful arts?
p210
aa(lp211
V1983. Bob Dylan is 42 years old, and his time
p212
aVin the cultural spotlight is long since past.
p213
aVHe records a song called "Blind Willie McTell,"
p214
aVnamed after the blues singer, and the song
p215
aVis a voyage through the past, through a much darker time,
p216
aVbut a simpler one, a time when musicians like Willie McTell
p217
aVhad few illusions about what they did.
p218
aV"I jump 'em from other writers
p219
aVbut I arrange 'em my own way."
p220
aa(lp221
VI think this is mostly what we do.
p222
aVOur creativity comes from without, not from within.
p223
aVWe are not self-made. We are dependent on one another,
p224
aVand admitting this to ourselves isn't an embrace
p225
aVof mediocrity and derivativeness.
p226
aVIt's a liberation from our misconceptions,
p227
aVand it's an incentive to not expect so much from ourselves
p228
aVand to simply begin.
p229
aa(lp230
VThank you so much. It was an honor to be here.
p231
aVThank you. (Applause)
p232
aVThank you. Thank you. (Applause)
p233
aVThank you. (Applause)
