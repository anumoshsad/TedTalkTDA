VFour years ago,
p4
aVa security researcher,
p5
aVor, as most people would call it, a hacker,
p6
aVfound a way to literally
p7
aVmake ATMs throw money at him.
p8
aVHis name was Barnaby Jack,
p9
aVand this technique was later called "jackpotting"
p10
aVin his honor.
p11
aa(lp12
VI'm here today because I think
p13
aVwe actually need hackers.
p14
aVBarnaby Jack
p15
aVcould have easily turned
p16
aVinto a career criminal or James Bond villain
p17
aVwith his knowledge,
p18
aVbut he chose to show the world
p19
aVhis research instead.
p20
aVHe believed that sometimes
p21
aVyou have to demo a threat
p22
aVto spark a solution.
p23
aVAnd I feel the same way.
p24
aVThat's why I'm here today.
p25
aa(lp26
VWe are often terrified and fascinated
p27
aVby the power hackers now have.
p28
aVThey scare us.
p29
aVBut the choices they make
p30
aVhave dramatic outcomes
p31
aVthat influence us all.
p32
aVSo I am here today because I think we need hackers,
p33
aVand in fact, they just might be
p34
aVthe immune system for the information age.
p35
aVSometimes they make us sick,
p36
aVbut they also find those hidden threats
p37
aVin our world,
p38
aVand they make us fix it.
p39
aa(lp40
VI knew that I might get hacked
p41
aVfor giving this talk,
p42
aVso let me save you the effort.
p43
aVIn true TED fashion,
p44
aVhere is my most embarrassing picture.
p45
aVBut it would be difficult for you to find me in it,
p46
aVbecause I'm the one who looks like a boy
p47
aVstanding to the side.
p48
aVI was such a nerd back then
p49
aVthat even the boys on the Dungeons and Dragons team
p50
aVwouldn't let me join.
p51
aVThis is who I was,
p52
aVbut this is who I wanted to be:
p53
aVAngelina Jolie.
p54
aVShe portrayed Acid Burn
p55
aVin the '95 film "Hackers."
p56
aVShe was pretty and she could rollerblade,
p57
aVbut being a hacker, that made her powerful.
p58
aVAnd I wanted to be just like her,
p59
aVso I started spending a lot of time
p60
aVon hacker chat rooms and online forums.
p61
aVI remember one late night
p62
aVI found a bit of PHP code.
p63
aVI didn't really know what it did,
p64
aVbut I copy-pasted it
p65
aVand used it anyway
p66
aVto get into a password-protected site
p67
aVlike that.
p68
aVOpen Sesame.
p69
aVIt was a simple trick,
p70
aVand I was just a script kiddie back then,
p71
aVbut to me, that trick,
p72
aVit felt like this,
p73
aVlike I had discovered limitless potential
p74
aVat my fingertips.
p75
aVThis is the rush of power that hackers feel.
p76
aVIt's geeks just like me
p77
aVdiscovering they have access to superpower,
p78
aVone that requires the skill and tenacity
p79
aVof their intellect,
p80
aVbut thankfully no radioactive spiders.
p81
aa(lp82
VBut with great power
p83
aVcomes great responsibility,
p84
aVand you all like to think that if we had such powers,
p85
aVwe would only use them for good.
p86
aVBut what if you could read your ex's emails,
p87
aVor add a couple zeros to your bank account.
p88
aVWhat would you do then?
p89
aVIndeed, many hackers do not resist
p90
aVthose temptations,
p91
aVand so they are responsible in one way or another
p92
aVto billions of dollars lost each year
p93
aVto fraud, malware or plain old identity theft,
p94
aVwhich is a serious issue.
p95
aVBut there are other hackers,
p96
aVhackers who just like to break things,
p97
aVand it is precisely those hackers
p98
aVthat can find the weaker elements in our world
p99
aVand make us fix it.
p100
aa(lp101
VThis is what happened last year
p102
aVwhen another security researcher
p103
aVcalled Kyle Lovett
p104
aVdiscovered a gaping hole
p105
aVin the design of certain wireless routers
p106
aVlike you might have in your home or office.
p107
aVHe learned that anyone could remotely connect
p108
aVto these devices over the Internet
p109
aVand download documents from hard drives
p110
aVattached to those routers,
p111
aVno password needed.
p112
aVHe reported it to the company, of course,
p113
aVbut they ignored his report.
p114
aVPerhaps they thought universal access
p115
aVwas a feature, not a bug,
p116
aVuntil two months ago
p117
aVwhen a group of hackers used it
p118
aVto get into people's files.
p119
aVBut they didn't steal anything.
p120
aVThey left a note:
p121
aVYour router and your documents
p122
aVcan be accessed by anyone in the world.
p123
aVHere's what you should do to fix it.
p124
aVWe hope we helped.
p125
aVBy getting into people's files like that,
p126
aVyeah, they broke the law,
p127
aVbut they also forced that company
p128
aVto fix their product.
p129
aa(lp130
VMaking vulnerabilities known to the public
p131
aVis a practice called full disclosure
p132
aVin the hacker community,
p133
aVand it is controversial,
p134
aVbut it does make me think of how hackers
p135
aVhave an evolving effect on technologies we use
p136
aVevery day.
p137
aVThis is what Khalil did.
p138
aVKhalil is a Palestinian hacker from the West Bank,
p139
aVand he found a serious privacy flaw on Facebook
p140
aVwhich he attempted to report
p141
aVthrough the company's bug bounty program.
p142
aVThese are usually great arrangements for companies
p143
aVto reward hackers disclosing vulnerabilities
p144
aVthey find in their code.
p145
aVUnfortunately, due to some miscommunications,
p146
aVhis report was not acknowledged.
p147
aVFrustrated with the exchange,
p148
aVhe took to use his own discovery
p149
aVto post on Mark Zuckerberg's wall.
p150
aVThis got their attention, all right,
p151
aVand they fixed the bug,
p152
aVbut because he hadn't reported it properly,
p153
aVhe was denied the bounty usually paid out
p154
aVfor such discoveries.
p155
aVThankfully for Khalil,
p156
aVa group of hackers were watching out for him.
p157
aVIn fact, they raised more than 13,000 dollars
p158
aVto reward him for this discovery,
p159
aVraising a vital discussion in the technology industry
p160
aVabout how we come up with incentives
p161
aVfor hackers to do the right thing.
p162
aVBut I think there's a greater story here still.
p163
aVEven companies founded by hackers,
p164
aVlike Facebook was,
p165
aVstill have a complicated relationship
p166
aVwhen it comes to hackers.
p167
aVAnd so for more conservative organizations,
p168
aVit is going to take time and adapting
p169
aVin order to embrace hacker culture
p170
aVand the creative chaos that it brings with it.
p171
aVBut I think it's worth the effort,
p172
aVbecause the alternative,
p173
aVto blindly fight all hackers,
p174
aVis to go against the power you cannot control
p175
aVat the cost of stifling innovation
p176
aVand regulating knowledge.
p177
aVThese are things that will come back and bite you.
p178
aa(lp179
VIt is even more true
p180
aVif we go after hackers
p181
aVthat are willing to risk their own freedom
p182
aVfor ideals like the freedom of the web,
p183
aVespecially in times like this, like today even,
p184
aVas governments and corporates
p185
aVfight to control the Internet.
p186
aVI find it astounding
p187
aVthat someone from the shadowy corners of cyberspace
p188
aVcan become its voice of opposition,
p189
aVits last line of defense even,
p190
aVperhaps someone like Anonymous,
p191
aVthe leading brand of global hacktivism.
p192
aVThis universal hacker movement
p193
aVneeds no introduction today,
p194
aVbut six years ago
p195
aVthey were not much more than an Internet subculture
p196
aVdedicated to sharing silly pictures of funny cats
p197
aVand Internet trolling campaigns.
p198
aVTheir moment of transformation was in early 2008
p199
aVwhen the Church of Scientology
p200
aVattempted to remove certain leaked videos
p201
aVfrom appearing on certain websites.
p202
aVThis is when Anonymous was forged
p203
aVout of the seemingly random collection
p204
aVof Internet dwellers.
p205
aVIt turns out,
p206
aVthe Internet doesn't like it
p207
aVwhen you try to remove things from it,
p208
aVand it will react with cyberattacks
p209
aVand elaborate pranks
p210
aVand with a series of organized protests
p211
aVall around the world,
p212
aVfrom my hometown of Tel Aviv
p213
aVto Adelaide, Australia.
p214
aVThis proved that Anonymous and this idea
p215
aVcan rally the masses from the keyboards
p216
aVto the streets,
p217
aVand it laid the foundations
p218
aVfor dozens of future operations
p219
aVagainst perceived injustices
p220
aVto their online and offline world.
p221
aVSince then, they've gone after many targets.
p222
aVThey've uncovered corruption, abuse.
p223
aVThey've hacked popes and politicians,
p224
aVand I think their effect is larger
p225
aVthan simple denial of service attacks
p226
aVthat take down websites
p227
aVor even leak sensitive documents.
p228
aVI think that, like Robin Hood,
p229
aVthey are in the business of redistribution,
p230
aVbut what they are after isn't your money.
p231
aVIt's not your documents. It's your attention.
p232
aVThey grab the spotlight for causes they support,
p233
aVforcing us to take note,
p234
aVacting as a global magnifying glass
p235
aVfor issues that we are not as aware of
p236
aVbut perhaps we should be.
p237
aVThey have been called many names
p238
aVfrom criminals to terrorists,
p239
aVand I cannot justify their illegal means,
p240
aVbut the ideas they fight for
p241
aVare ones that matter to us all.
p242
aVThe reality is,
p243
aVhackers can do a lot more than break things.
p244
aVThey can bring people together.
p245
aa(lp246
VAnd if the Internet doesn't like it
p247
aVwhen you try to remove things from it,
p248
aVjust watch what happens
p249
aVwhen you try to shut the Internet down.
p250
aVThis took place in Egypt in January 2011,
p251
aVand as President Hosni Mubarak
p252
aVattempted a desperate move
p253
aVto quash the rising revolution on the streets of Cairo,
p254
aVhe sent his personal troops
p255
aVdown to Egypt's Internet service providers
p256
aVand had them physically kill the switch
p257
aVon the country's connection to the world overnight.
p258
aVFor a government to do a thing like that
p259
aVwas unprecedented,
p260
aVand for hackers, it made it personal.
p261
aVHackers like the Telecomix group
p262
aVwere already active on the ground,
p263
aVhelping Egyptians bypass censorship
p264
aVusing clever workarounds like Morse code
p265
aVand ham radio.
p266
aVIt was high season for low tech,
p267
aVwhich the government couldn't block,
p268
aVbut when the Net went completely down,
p269
aVTelecomix brought in the big guns.
p270
aVThey found European service providers
p271
aVthat still had 20-year-old
p272
aVanalog dial-up access infrastructure.
p273
aVThey opened up 300 of those lines
p274
aVfor Egyptians to use,
p275
aVserving slow but sweet Internet connection
p276
aVfor Egyptians.
p277
aVThis worked.
p278
aVIt worked so well, in fact,
p279
aVone guy even used it to download an episode
p280
aVof "How I Met Your Mother."
p281
aVBut while Egypt's future is still uncertain,
p282
aVwhen the same thing happened in Syria
p283
aVjust one year later,
p284
aVTelecomix were prepared with those Internet lines,
p285
aVand Anonymous,
p286
aVthey were perhaps the first international group
p287
aVto officially denounce the actions
p288
aVof the Syrian military
p289
aVby defacing their website.
p290
aa(lp291
VBut with this sort of power,
p292
aVit really depends on where you stand,
p293
aVbecause one man's hero
p294
aVcan be another's villain,
p295
aVand so the Syrian Electronic Army
p296
aVis a pro-Assad group of hackers
p297
aVwho support his contentious regime.
p298
aVThey've taken down multiple high-profile targets
p299
aVin the past few years,
p300
aVincluding the Associated Press's Twitter account,
p301
aVin which they posted a message
p302
aVabout an attack on the White House
p303
aVinjuring President Obama.
p304
aVThis tweet was fake, of course,
p305
aVbut the resulting drop in the Dow Jones index
p306
aVthat day was most certainly not,
p307
aVand a lot of people lost a lot of money.
p308
aa(lp309
VThis sort of thing is happening all over the world right now.
p310
aVIn conflicts from the Crimean Peninsula
p311
aVto Latin America,
p312
aVfrom Europe to the United States,
p313
aVhackers are a force for social,
p314
aVpolitical and military influence.
p315
aVAs individuals or in groups,
p316
aVvolunteers or military conflicts,
p317
aVthere are hackers everywhere.
p318
aVThey come from all walks of life,
p319
aVethnicities, ideologies and genders, I might add.
p320
aVThey are now shaping the world's stage.
p321
aVHackers represent an exceptional force for change
p322
aVin the 21st century.
p323
aVThis is because access to information
p324
aVis a critical currency of power,
p325
aVone which governments would like to control,
p326
aVa thing they attempt to do by setting up
p327
aVall-you-can-eat surveillance programs,
p328
aVa thing they need hackers for, by the way.
p329
aVAnd so the establishment has long had
p330
aVa love-hate relationship when it comes to hackers,
p331
aVbecause the same people who demonize hacking
p332
aValso utilize it at large.
p333
aa(lp334
VTwo years ago,
p335
aVI saw General Keith Alexander.
p336
aVHe's the NSA director and U.S. cyber commander,
p337
aVbut instead of his four star general uniform,
p338
aVhe was wearing jeans and a t-shirt.
p339
aVThis was at DEF CON,
p340
aVthe world's largest hacker conference.
p341
aVPerhaps like me, General Alexander
p342
aVdidn't see 12,000 criminals that day in Vegas.
p343
aVI think he saw untapped potential.
p344
aVIn fact, he was there to give a hiring pitch.
p345
aV"In this room right here," he said,
p346
aV"is the talent our nation needs."
p347
aVWell, hackers in the back row replied,
p348
aV"Then stop arresting us."
p349
aV(Applause)
p350
aa(lp351
VIndeed, for years,
p352
aVhackers have been on the wrong side of the fence,
p353
aVbut in light of what we know now,
p354
aVwho is more watchful of our online world?
p355
aVThe rules of the game are not that clear anymore,
p356
aVbut hackers are perhaps the only ones
p357
aVstill capable of challenging overreaching governments
p358
aVand data-hoarding corporates
p359
aVon their own playing field.
p360
aVTo me, that represents hope.
p361
aa(lp362
VFor the past three decades,
p363
aVhackers have done a lot of things,
p364
aVbut they have also impacted civil liberties,
p365
aVinnovation and Internet freedom,
p366
aVso I think it's time we take a good look
p367
aVat how we choose to portray them,
p368
aVbecause if we keep expecting them to be the bad guys,
p369
aVhow can they be the heroes too?
p370
aVMy years in the hacker world
p371
aVhave made me realize
p372
aVboth the problem and the beauty about hackers:
p373
aVThey just can't see something broken in the world
p374
aVand leave it be.
p375
aVThey are compelled
p376
aVto either exploit it or try and change it,
p377
aVand so they find the vulnerable aspects
p378
aVin our rapidly changing world.
p379
aVThey make us, they force us to fix things
p380
aVor demand something better,
p381
aVand I think we need them
p382
aVto do just that,
p383
aVbecause after all, it is not information
p384
aVthat wants to be free, it's us.
p385
aa(lp386
VThank you very much.
p387
aa(lp388
VThank you. (Applause)
