VI am a climate scientist,
p4
aVand I hate weather.
p5
aVI have spent too much time in California,
p6
aVand I strongly feel that weather should be optional.
p7
aa(lp8
V(Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
VSo I don't want to experience clouds,
p11
aVlet alone study them.
p12
aVBut clouds seem to follow me wherever I go.
p13
aa(lp14
VThe thing is, clouds are a real challenge for climate science.
p15
aVWe don't know how they're going to react as the planet heats up,
p16
aVand hidden in that uncertainty
p17
aVmight be hope.
p18
aVMaybe, just maybe,
p19
aVclouds could slow down global warming,
p20
aVand buy us a little bit more time to get our act together,
p21
aVwhich would be very convenient right now.
p22
aVI mean, even I could put up with a few more cloudy days
p23
aVif clouds saved the planet.
p24
aa(lp25
VNow, we are sure about some things.
p26
aVCarbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas,
p27
aVwe're emitting a lot of it,
p28
aVand the planet is heating up.
p29
aVCase closed.
p30
aVBut I still go to work every day.
p31
aVIt turns out that there is a lot that we don't understand
p32
aVabout climate change.
p33
aVIn particular, we haven't answered
p34
aVwhat seems to be a very fundamental question.
p35
aVWe know it's going to get hot,
p36
aVbut we don't know exactly how hot it's going to get.
p37
aVNow, this is a really easy question to answer
p38
aVif one of you would like to give me a time machine.
p39
aVBut I'm going to be honest with you:
p40
aVif I had a time machine,
p41
aVI would not be hanging out at this particular point in history.
p42
aVSo in order to see the future,
p43
aVwe have to rely on the output of computer simulations \u2014
p44
aVclimate models, like this one.
p45
aa(lp46
VNow, in my line of work,
p47
aVI encounter many very charming people on the internet
p48
aVwho like to tell me that climate models are all wrong.
p49
aVAnd I would just like to say:
p50
aVno kidding!
p51
aVSeriously? I get paid to complain about climate models.
p52
aVBut we don't want models to be perfect.
p53
aVWe want them to be useful.
p54
aVI mean, think about it:
p55
aVa computer simulation
p56
aVthat's able to exactly reproduce all of reality.
p57
aVThat's not a climate model;
p58
aVThat's "The Matrix."
p59
aVSo, models are not crystal balls.
p60
aVThey're research tools,
p61
aVand the ways in which they're wrong can actually teach us a lot.
p62
aa(lp63
VFor example:
p64
aVdifferent climate models are largely able to capture
p65
aVthe warming that we've seen so far.
p66
aVBut fast-forward to the end of the century
p67
aVunder a business-as-usual scenario,
p68
aVand climate models don't really agree anymore.
p69
aVYeah, they're all warming; that's just basic physics.
p70
aVBut some of them project catastrophe \u2014
p71
aVmore than five times the warming we've seen already.
p72
aVAnd others are literally more chill.
p73
aa(lp74
VSo why don't climate models agree on how warm it's going to get?
p75
aVWell, to a large extent,
p76
aVit's because they don't agree on what clouds will do in the future.
p77
aVAnd that is because, just like me,
p78
aVcomputers hate clouds.
p79
aVComputers hate clouds because they're simultaneously very large
p80
aVand very small.
p81
aVClouds are formed
p82
aVwhen microscopic water droplets or ice crystals coalesce
p83
aVaround tiny particles.
p84
aVBut at the same time, they cover two-thirds of the earth's surface.
p85
aVIn order to really accurately model clouds,
p86
aVwe'd need to track the behavior of every water droplet and dust grain
p87
aVin the entire atmosphere,
p88
aVand there's no computer powerful enough to do that.
p89
aVSo instead, we have to make a trade-off:
p90
aVwe can zoom in and get the details right,
p91
aVbut have no idea what's going on worldwide;
p92
aVor, we could sacrifice realism at small scales
p93
aVin order to see the bigger picture.
p94
aVNow, there's no one right answer,
p95
aVno perfect way to do this,
p96
aVand different climate models make different choices.
p97
aa(lp98
VNow, it is unfortunate
p99
aVthat computers struggle with clouds,
p100
aVbecause clouds are crucially important
p101
aVin regulating the temperature of the planet.
p102
aVIn fact, if all the clouds went away,
p103
aVwe would experience profound climate changes.
p104
aVBut without clouds,
p105
aVwould it be warmer or colder?
p106
aVThe answer is both.
p107
aa(lp108
VSo I'm going to be honest with you, I am not a cloud spotter.
p109
aVMy favorite type of cloud is none.
p110
aVBut even I know that clouds come in all shapes and sizes.
p111
aVLow, thick clouds like these are really good at blocking out the sun
p112
aVand ruining your barbecue,
p113
aVand high, wispy clouds like these cirrus
p114
aVlargely let that sunlight stream through.
p115
aVEvery sunny day is the same,
p116
aVbut every cloudy day is cloudy in its own way.
p117
aVAnd it's this diversity
p118
aVthat can make the global impact of clouds very hard to understand.
p119
aVSo to see this global effect of clouds,
p120
aVit really helps to take a selfie.
p121
aa(lp122
VIt will never cease to blow my mind
p123
aVthat we can see our planet from outer space,
p124
aVbut we can't see all of it.
p125
aVClouds are blocking the view.
p126
aVThat's what they do.
p127
aVThese low, thick clouds are extremely effective sunshades.
p128
aVThey turn back about 20 percent of everything the sun sends us.
p129
aVThat is a lot of wasted solar power.
p130
aVSo, low clouds are powerful sunshades,
p131
aVmaking the planet cooler.
p132
aVBut that's not the only effect of clouds.
p133
aVOur planet has a temperature,
p134
aVand like anything with a temperature,
p135
aVit's giving off heat.
p136
aVWe are radiating thermal energy away into space,
p137
aVand we can see this in the infrared.
p138
aVOnce again, clouds are blocking the view.
p139
aVThat's because high clouds live in the upper reaches of the atmosphere,
p140
aVwhere it's very cold.
p141
aVAnd this means that they lose very little heat to space themselves.
p142
aVBut at the same time, they block the heat coming up from the planet below.
p143
aVThe earth is trying to cool itself off,
p144
aVand high clouds are getting in the way.
p145
aVThe result is a very powerful greenhouse effect.
p146
aVSo, clouds play this very large and dual role
p147
aVin the climate system.
p148
aVWe've got low clouds that act like a sunshade,
p149
aVcooling the planet,
p150
aVand high clouds which act like a greenhouse,
p151
aVwarming the planet.
p152
aa(lp153
VRight now, these two effects \u2014 they don't cancel out.
p154
aVThat sunshade \u2014 it's a little bit more powerful.
p155
aVSo if we got rid of all the clouds tomorrow,
p156
aVwhich, for the record, I am not advocating,
p157
aVour planet would get warmer.
p158
aVSo clearly, all of the clouds are not going away.
p159
aVBut climate change is change.
p160
aVSo we can ask:
p161
aVHow will global warming change clouds?
p162
aVBut remember, clouds are so important
p163
aVin regulating the earth's temperature,
p164
aVand they both warm and cool the planet.
p165
aVSo even small changes to cloud cover
p166
aVcould have profound consequences.
p167
aVSo we might also ask:
p168
aVHow will clouds change global warming?
p169
aa(lp170
VAnd that is where there might be space for hope.
p171
aVIf global warming triggers cloud changes
p172
aVthat make for a less powerful greenhouse or a more effective sunshade,
p173
aVthen that would enhance the cooling power of clouds.
p174
aVIt would act in opposition to global warming,
p175
aVand that's what's happening in those climate models
p176
aVthat project relatively muted warming.
p177
aVBut climate models struggle with clouds,
p178
aVand this uncertainty \u2014 it goes both ways.
p179
aVClouds could help us out with global warming.
p180
aVThey could also make it worse.
p181
aa(lp182
VNow, we know that climate change is happening
p183
aVbecause we can see it:
p184
aVrising temperatures, melting icecaps, shifts in rainfall patterns.
p185
aVAnd you might think that we could also see it in the clouds.
p186
aVBut here's something else unfortunate:
p187
aVclouds are really hard to see.
p188
aVI see everybody from the Pacific Northwest
p189
aVis like, "I have some suggestions for you."
p190
aa(lp191
V(Laughter)
p192
aa(lp193
VAnd you guys, we have tried looking up.
p194
aa(lp195
V(Laughter)
p196
aa(lp197
VBut in order to do climate science,
p198
aVwe need to see all of the clouds, everywhere, for a very long time.
p199
aVAnd that's what makes it hard.
p200
aVNow, nothing sees more clouds than a satellite \u2014
p201
aVnot even a British person.
p202
aa(lp203
V(Laughter)
p204
aa(lp205
VAnd fortunately, we do have satellite observations of clouds
p206
aVthat, like me, date back to the 1980s.
p207
aVBut these satellites were designed for weather,
p208
aVnot climate.
p209
aVThey weren't in it for the long haul.
p210
aVSo to get that long-term trend information,
p211
aVwe need to do climate science.
p212
aVWe have to stitch together the output of multiple satellites
p213
aVwith different viewing angles and orbits
p214
aVand carrying different camera equipment.
p215
aVAnd as a result,
p216
aVthere are gaps in our knowledge.
p217
aVBut even from this very cloudy picture,
p218
aVwe're starting to get hints of a possible future.
p219
aa(lp220
VWhen we looked at the observations,
p221
aVone thing jumped out at us:
p222
aVthe clouds are moving.
p223
aVAs the planet's temperature increases,
p224
aVhigh clouds rise up.
p225
aVThey move to the colder upper reaches of the atmosphere,
p226
aVand this means that even as the planet heats up,
p227
aVhigh clouds don't.
p228
aVThey remain at roughly the same temperature.
p229
aVSo they are not losing more heat to space.
p230
aVBut at the same time, they're trapping more heat
p231
aVfrom the warming planet below.
p232
aVThis intensifies the greenhouse effect.
p233
aVHigh clouds are making global warming worse.
p234
aa(lp235
VClouds are moving in other dimensions, too.
p236
aVThe atmospheric circulation, that large-scale motion
p237
aVof air and water in the atmosphere,
p238
aVis changing,
p239
aVand clouds are going with it.
p240
aVOn large scales,
p241
aVclouds seem to be moving from the tropics toward the poles.
p242
aVIt's kind of like your grandparents in reverse.
p243
aVAnd this matters,
p244
aVbecause if your job is to block incoming sunlight,
p245
aVyou are going to be much more effective in the tropics
p246
aVunder that intense tropical sun
p247
aVthan you are in higher latitudes.
p248
aVSo if this keeps up,
p249
aVthis will also make global warming worse.
p250
aVAnd what we have not found,
p251
aVdespite years of looking,
p252
aVis any indication of the opposite.
p253
aVThere is no observational evidence
p254
aVthat clouds will substantially slow down global warming.
p255
aVThe earth is not going to break its own fever.
p256
aa(lp257
VNow, there are still uncertainties here.
p258
aVWe don't know for sure
p259
aVwhat the future holds.
p260
aVBut we are sending our kids there,
p261
aVand they are never coming back.
p262
aVI want them to be prepared for what they'll face,
p263
aVand that is why it is so important
p264
aVto keep our earth-observing satellites up there
p265
aVand to hire diverse and smart and talented people
p266
aVwho do not hate clouds
p267
aVto improve the climate models.
p268
aa(lp269
VBut uncertainty is not ignorance.
p270
aVWe don't know everything,
p271
aVbut we don't know nothing,
p272
aVand we know what carbon dioxide does.
p273
aVI started my career as an astrophysicist,
p274
aVso you can believe me
p275
aVwhen I say that this is the greatest place in the universe.
p276
aVOther planets might have liquid water.
p277
aVOn earth, we have whiskey.
p278
aa(lp279
V(Laughter)
p280
aa(lp281
V(Applause)
p282
aa(lp283
VWe are so lucky to live here,
p284
aVbut let's not push our luck.
p285
aVI don't think that clouds will save the planet.
p286
aVI think that's probably up to us.
p287
aa(lp288
VThank you.
