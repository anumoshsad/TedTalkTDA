VWhat is bioenergy? Bioenergy is not ethanol.
p4
aVBioenergy isn't global warming. Bioenergy is
p5
aVsomething which seems counterintuitive. Bioenergy
p6
aVis oil. It's gas. It's coal. And part of building
p7
aVthat bridge to the future, to the point where we
p8
aVcan actually see the oceans in a rational way, or
p9
aVput up these geo-spatial orbits that will twirl or
p10
aVdo microwaves or stuff, is going to depend on how
p11
aVwe understand bioenergy and manage it. And to do
p12
aVthat, you really have to look first at agriculture.
p13
aa(lp14
VSo we've been planting stuff for 11,000 years. And
p15
aVin the measure that we plant stuff, what we learn
p16
aVfrom agriculture is you've got to deal with pests,
p17
aVyou've got to deal with all types of awful things,
p18
aVyou've got to cultivate stuff. In the measure
p19
aVthat you learn how to use water to cultivate, then
p20
aVyou're going to be able to spread beyond the Nile.
p21
aVYou're going to be able to power stuff, so irrigation
p22
aVmakes a difference.
p23
aa(lp24
VIrrigation starts to make you be allowed to plant
p25
aVstuff where you want it, as opposed to where the
p26
aVrivers flood. You start getting this organic
p27
aVagriculture; you start putting machinery onto this
p28
aVstuff. Machinery, with a whole bunch of water,
p29
aVleads to very large-scale agriculture.
p30
aVYou put together machines and water, and you get
p31
aVlandscapes that look like this. And then you get
p32
aVsales that look like this. It's brute force. So
p33
aVwhat you've been doing in agriculture is you start
p34
aVout with something that's a reasonably natural
p35
aVsystem. You start taming that natural system. You
p36
aVput a lot of force behind that natural system. You
p37
aVput a whole bunch of pesticides and herbicides \u2014
p38
aV(Laughter) \u2014 behind that natural system, and you
p39
aVend up with systems that look like this.
p40
aa(lp41
VAnd it's all brute force. And that's the way we've
p42
aVbeen approaching energy. So the lesson in
p43
aVagriculture is that you can actually change the
p44
aVsystem that's based on brute force as you start
p45
aVmerging that system and learning that system and
p46
aVactually applying biology. And you move from a
p47
aVdiscipline of engineering, you move from a
p48
aVdiscipline of chemistry, into a discipline of
p49
aVbiology. And probably one of the most important
p50
aVhuman beings on the planet is this guy behind me.
p51
aa(lp52
VThis is a guy called Norman Borlaug. He won the
p53
aVNobel Prize. He's got the Congressional Medal of
p54
aVHonor. He deserves all of this stuff. And he
p55
aVdeserves this stuff because he probably has fed
p56
aVmore people than any other human being alive
p57
aVbecause he researched how to put biology behind
p58
aVseeds. He did this in Mexico. The reason why India
p59
aVand China no longer have these massive famines is
p60
aVbecause Norman Borlaug taught them how to grow
p61
aVgrains in a more efficient way and launched the
p62
aVGreen Revolution. That is something that a lot of
p63
aVpeople have criticized. But of course, those are
p64
aVpeople who don't realize that China and India,
p65
aVinstead of having huge amounts of starving people,
p66
aVare exporting grains.
p67
aa(lp68
VAnd the irony of this particular system is the
p69
aVplace where he did the research, which was Mexico,
p70
aVdidn't adopt this technology, ignored this
p71
aVtechnology, talked about why this technology
p72
aVshould be thought about, but not really applied.
p73
aVAnd Mexico remains one of the largest grain
p74
aVimporters on the planet because it doesn't apply
p75
aVtechnology that was discovered in Mexico. And in
p76
aVfact, hasn't recognized this man, to the point
p77
aVwhere there aren't statues of this man all over
p78
aVMexico. There are in China and India. And the
p79
aVInstitute that this guy ran has now moved to
p80
aVIndia. That is the difference between adopting
p81
aVtechnologies and discussing technologies.
p82
aVNow, it's not just that this guy fed a huge amount
p83
aVof people in the world. It's that this is the net
p84
aVeffect in terms of what technology does, if you
p85
aVunderstand biology.
p86
aa(lp87
VWhat happened in agriculture? Well, if you take
p88
aVagriculture over a century, agriculture in about
p89
aV1900 would have been recognizable to somebody
p90
aVplanting a thousand years earlier. Yeah, the plows look
p91
aVdifferent. The machines were tractors or stuff
p92
aVinstead of mules, but the farmer would have
p93
aVunderstood: this is what the guy's doing, this is
p94
aVwhy he's doing it, this is where he's going. What
p95
aVreally started to change in agriculture is when
p96
aVyou started moving from this brute force
p97
aVengineering and chemistry into biology, and that's
p98
aVwhere you get your productivity increases. And as
p99
aVyou do that stuff, here's what happens to
p100
aVproductivity.
p101
aa(lp102
VBasically, you go from 250 hours to produce 100
p103
aVbushels, to 40, to 15, to five. Agricultural labor
p104
aVproductivity increased seven times, 1950 to 2000,
p105
aVwhereas the rest of the economy increased about
p106
aV2.5 times. This is an absolutely massive increase
p107
aVin how much is produced per person.
p108
aVThe effect of this, of course, is it's not just
p109
aVamber waves of grain, it is mountains of stuff.
p110
aVAnd 50 percent of the EU budget is going to subsidize
p111
aVagriculture from mountains of stuff that people
p112
aVhave overproduced.
p113
aa(lp114
VThis would be a good outcome for energy. And of
p115
aVcourse, by now, you're probably saying to
p116
aVyourself, "Self, I thought I came to a talk about
p117
aVenergy and here's this guy talking about biology."
p118
aVSo where's the link between these two things?
p119
aVOne of the ironies of this whole system is we're
p120
aVdiscussing what to do about a system that we don't
p121
aVunderstand. We don't even know what oil is. We
p122
aVdon't know where oil comes from. I mean,
p123
aVliterally, it's still a source of debate what
p124
aVthis black river of stuff is and where it comes
p125
aVfrom. The best assumption, and one of the best
p126
aVguesses in this stuff, is that this stuff comes
p127
aVout of this stuff, that these things absorb
p128
aVsunlight, rot under pressure for millions of
p129
aVyears, and you get these black rivers.
p130
aa(lp131
VNow, the interesting thing about that thesis \u2014 if
p132
aVthat thesis turns out to be true \u2014 is that oil,
p133
aVand all hydrocarbons, turned out to be
p134
aVconcentrated sunlight. And if you think of
p135
aVbioenergy, bioenergy isn't ethanol. Bioenergy is
p136
aVtaking the sun, concentrating it in amoebas,
p137
aVconcentrating it in plants, and maybe that's why
p138
aVyou get these rainbows.
p139
aVAnd as you're looking at this system, if
p140
aVhydrocarbons are concentrated sunlight, then
p141
aVbioenergy works in a different way. And we've got
p142
aVto start thinking of oil and other hydrocarbons as
p143
aVpart of these solar panels.
p144
aVMaybe that's one of the reasons why if you fly
p145
aVover west Texas, the types of wells that you're
p146
aVbeginning to see don't look unlike those pictures
p147
aVof Kansas and those irrigated plots.
p148
aa(lp149
VThis is how you farm oil. And as you think of
p150
aVfarming oil and how oil has evolved, we started
p151
aVwith this brute force approach. And then what did
p152
aVwe learn? Then we learned we had to go bigger. And
p153
aVthen what'd we learn? Then we have to go even
p154
aVbigger. And we are getting really destructive as
p155
aVwe're going out and farming this bioenergy.
p156
aVThese are the Athabasca tar sands, and there's an
p157
aVenormous amount \u2014 first of mining, the largest
p158
aVtrucks in the world are working here, and then
p159
aVyou've got to pull out this black sludge, which is
p160
aVbasically oil that doesn't flow. It's tied to the
p161
aVsand. And then you've got to use a lot of steam to
p162
aVseparate it, which only works at today's oil
p163
aVprices.
p164
aa(lp165
VCoal. Coal turns out to be virtually the same
p166
aVstuff. It is probably plants, except that these
p167
aVhave been burned and crushed under pressure.
p168
aVSo you take something like this, you burn it, you
p169
aVput it under pressure, and likely as not, you get
p170
aVthis. Although, again, I stress: we don't know.
p171
aVWhich is curious as we debate all this stuff. But
p172
aVas you think of coal, this is what burned wheat
p173
aVkernels look like. Not entirely unlike coal.
p174
aa(lp175
VAnd of course, coalmines are very dangerous
p176
aVplaces because in some of these coalmines, you
p177
aVget gas. When that gas blows up, people die. So
p178
aVyou're producing a biogas out of coal in some
p179
aVmines, but not in others.
p180
aVAny place you see a differential, there're some
p181
aVinteresting questions. There's some questions as
p182
aVto what you should be doing with this stuff. But
p183
aVagain, coal. Maybe the same stuff, maybe the same
p184
aVsystem, maybe bioenergy, and you're applying
p185
aVexactly the same technology.
p186
aa(lp187
VHere's your brute force approach. Once you get
p188
aVthrough your brute force approach, then you just
p189
aVrip off whole mountaintops. And you end up with
p190
aVthe single largest source of carbon emissions,
p191
aVwhich are coal-fired gas plants. That is probably
p192
aVnot the best use of bioenergy.
p193
aVAs you think of what are the alternatives to this
p194
aVsystem \u2014 it's important to find alternatives
p195
aVbecause it turns out that the U.S. is dwindling in
p196
aVits petroleum reserves, but it is not dwindling in
p197
aVits coal reserves, nor is China. There are huge
p198
aVcoal reserves that are sitting out there, and
p199
aVwe've got to start thinking of them as biological
p200
aVenergy, because if we keep treating them as
p201
aVchemical energy, or engineering energy, we're
p202
aVgoing to be in deep doo-doo.
p203
aa(lp204
VGas is a similar issue. Gas is also a biological
p205
aVproduct. And as you think of gas, well, you're
p206
aVfamiliar with gas. And here's a different way of
p207
aVmining coal.
p208
aVThis is called coal bed methane. Why is this
p209
aVpicture interesting? Because if coal turns out to
p210
aVbe concentrated plant life, the reason why you may
p211
aVget a differential in gas output between one mine
p212
aVand another \u2014 the reason why one mine may blow up
p213
aVand another one may not blow up \u2014 may be because
p214
aVthere's stuff eating that stuff and producing gas.
p215
aVThis is a well-known phenomenon. (Laughter) You
p216
aVeat certain things, you produce a lot of gas. It
p217
aVmay turn out that biological processes in coalmines
p218
aVhave the same process. If that is true, then
p219
aVone of the ways of getting the energy out of coal
p220
aVmay not be to rip whole mountaintops off, and it
p221
aVmay not be to burn coal. It may be to have stuff
p222
aVprocess that coal in a biological fashion as you
p223
aVdid in agriculture.
p224
aa(lp225
VThat is what bioenergy is. It is not ethanol. It
p226
aVis not subsidies to a few companies. It is not
p227
aVimporting corn into Iowa because you've built so
p228
aVmany of these ethanol plants. It is beginning to
p229
aVunderstand the transition that occurred in
p230
aVagriculture, from brute force into biological
p231
aVforce. And in the measure that you can do that,
p232
aVyou can clean some stuff, and you can clean it
p233
aVpretty quickly.
p234
aVWe already have some indicators of productivity on
p235
aVthis stuff. OK, if you put steam into coal fields
p236
aVor petroleum fields that have been running for
p237
aVdecades, you can get a really substantial
p238
aVincrease, like an eight-fold increase, in your
p239
aVoutput. This is just the beginning stages of this
p240
aVstuff.
p241
aa(lp242
VAnd as you think of biomaterials, this guy \u2014 who
p243
aVdid part of the sequencing of the human genome,
p244
aVwho just doubled the databases of genes and
p245
aVproteins known on earth by sailing around the
p246
aVworld \u2014 has been thinking about how you structure
p247
aVthis. And there's a series of smart people
p248
aVthinking about this. And they've been putting
p249
aVtogether companies like Synthetic Genomics, like,
p250
aVa Cambria, like Codon, and what those companies are
p251
aVtrying to do is to think of, how do you apply
p252
aVbiological principles to avoid brute force?
p253
aVThink of it in the following terms. Think of it as
p254
aVbeginning to program stuff for specific purposes.
p255
aVThink of the cell as a hardware. Think of the
p256
aVgenes as a software. And in the measure that you
p257
aVbegin to think of life as code that is
p258
aVinterchangeable, that can become energy, that can
p259
aVbecome food, that can become fiber, that can
p260
aVbecome human beings, that can become a whole
p261
aVseries of things, then you've got to shift your
p262
aVapproach as to how you're going to structure and
p263
aVdeal and think about energy in a very different
p264
aVway.
p265
aa(lp266
VWhat are the first principles of this stuff and
p267
aVwhere are we heading? This is one of the gentle
p268
aVgiants on the planet. He's one of the nicest human
p269
aVbeings you've ever met. His name is Hamilton
p270
aVSmith. He won the Nobel for figuring out how to
p271
aVcut genes \u2014 something called restriction enzymes.
p272
aVHe was at Hopkins when he did this, and he's such
p273
aVa modest guy that the day he won, his mother
p274
aVcalled him and said, "I didn't realize there was
p275
aVanother Ham Smith at Hopkins. Do you know he just
p276
aVwon the Nobel?" (Laughter) I mean, that was Mom,
p277
aVbut anyway, this guy is just a class act. You find
p278
aVhim at the bench every single day, working on a
p279
aVpipette and building stuff. And one of the things
p280
aVthis guy just built are these things.
p281
aa(lp282
VWhat is this? This is the first transplant of
p283
aVnaked DNA, where you take an entire DNA operating
p284
aVsystem out of one cell, insert it into a different
p285
aVcell, and have that cell boot up as a separate
p286
aVspecies. That's one month old. You will see stuff
p287
aVin the next month that will be just as important
p288
aVas this stuff.
p289
aVAnd as you think about this stuff and what the
p290
aVimplications of this are, we're going to start not
p291
aVjust converting ethanol from corn with very high
p292
aVsubsidies. We're going to start thinking about
p293
aVbiology entering energy. It is very expensive to
p294
aVprocess this stuff, both in economic terms and in
p295
aVenergy terms.
p296
aa(lp297
VThis is what accumulates in the tar sands of
p298
aVAlberta. These are sulfur blocks. Because as you
p299
aVseparate that petroleum from the sand, and use an
p300
aVenormous amount of energy inside that vapor \u2014
p301
aVsteam to separate this stuff \u2014 you also have to
p302
aVseparate out the sulfur. The difference between
p303
aVlight crude and heavy crude \u2014 well, it's about 14
p304
aVbucks a barrel. That's why you're building these
p305
aVpyramids of sulfur blocks. And by the way, the
p306
aVscale on these things is pretty large.
p307
aa(lp308
VNow, if you can take part of the energy content
p309
aVout of doing this, you reduce the system, and you
p310
aVreally do start applying biological principles to
p311
aVenergy. This has to be a bridge to the point where
p312
aVyou can get to wind, to the point where you can
p313
aVget to solar, to the point where you can get to
p314
aVnuclear \u2014 and hopefully you won't build the next
p315
aVnuclear plant on a beautiful seashore next to an
p316
aVearthquake fault. (Laughter) Just a thought.
p317
aa(lp318
VBut in the meantime, for the next decade at least,
p319
aVthe name of the game is hydrocarbons. And be that
p320
aVoil, be that gas, be that coal, this is what we're
p321
aVdealing with. And before I make this talk too
p322
aVlong, here's what's happening in the current
p323
aVenergy system.
p324
aV86 percent of the energy we consume are
p325
aVhydrocarbons. That means 86 percent of the stuff we're
p326
aVconsuming are probably processed plants and
p327
aVamoebas and the rest of the stuff. And there's a
p328
aVrole in here for conservation. There's a role in
p329
aVhere for alternative stuff, but we've also got to
p330
aVget that other portion right.
p331
aVHow we deal with that other portion is our bridge
p332
aVto the future. And as we think of this bridge to
p333
aVthe future, one of the things you should ponder
p334
aVis: we are leaving about two-thirds of the oil today
p335
aVinside those wells. So we're spending an enormous
p336
aVamount of money and leaving most of the energy
p337
aVdown there. Which, of course, requires more energy
p338
aVto go out and get energy. The ratios become
p339
aVidiotic by the time you get to ethanol. It may
p340
aVeven be a one-to-one ratio on the energy input and
p341
aVthe energy output. That is a stupid way of
p342
aVmanaging this system.
p343
aa(lp344
VLast point, last graph. One of the things that
p345
aVwe've got to do is to stabilize oil prices. This
p346
aVis what oil prices look like, OK?
p347
aVThis is a very bad system because what happens is
p348
aVyour hurdle rate gets set very low. People come up
p349
aVwith really smart ideas for solar panels, or for
p350
aVwind, or for something else, and then guess what?
p351
aVThe oil price goes through the floor. That company
p352
aVgoes out of business, and then you can bring the
p353
aVoil price back up.
p354
aa(lp355
VSo if I had one closing and modest suggestion,
p356
aVlet's set a stable oil price in Europe and the
p357
aVUnited States. How do you do that? Well, let's put
p358
aVa tax on oil that is a non-revenue tax, and it
p359
aVbasically says for the next 20 years, the price of
p360
aVoil will be \u2014 whatever you want, 35 bucks, 40
p361
aVbucks. If the OPEC price falls below that, we tax
p362
aVit. If the OPEC price goes above that, the tax
p363
aVgoes away.
p364
aVWhat does that do for entrepreneurs? What does it
p365
aVdo for companies? It tells people, if you can
p366
aVproduce energy for less than 35 bucks a barrel, or
p367
aVless than 40 bucks a barrel, or less than 50 bucks
p368
aVa barrel \u2014 let's debate it \u2014 you will have a
p369
aVbusiness. But let's not put people through this
p370
aVcycle where it doesn't pay to research because
p371
aVyour company will go out of business as OPEC
p372
aVdrives alternatives and keeps bioenergy from
p373
aVhappening. Thank you.
