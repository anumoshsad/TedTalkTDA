VWhen I was a child, I always wanted to be a superhero.
p4
aVI wanted to save the world and make everyone happy.
p5
aVBut I knew that I'd need superpowers to make my dreams come true.
p6
aVSo I used to embark on these imaginary journeys
p7
aVto find intergalactic objects from planet Krypton,
p8
aVwhich was a lot of fun, but didn't yield much result.
p9
aVWhen I grew up and realized
p10
aVthat science fiction was not a good source for superpowers,
p11
aVI decided instead to embark on a journey of real science,
p12
aVto find a more useful truth.
p13
aa(lp14
VI started my journey in California,
p15
aVwith a UC Berkeley 30-year longitudinal study
p16
aVthat examined the photos of students in an old yearbook,
p17
aVand tried to measure their success and well-being throughout their life.
p18
aVBy measuring the students' smiles,
p19
aVresearchers were able to predict
p20
aVhow fulfilling and long-lasting a subject's marriage would be,
p21
aa(lp22
V(Laughter)
p23
aa(lp24
Vhow well she would score on standardized tests of well-being,
p25
aVand how inspiring she would be to others.
p26
aVIn another yearbook, I stumbled upon Barry Obama's picture.
p27
aVWhen I first saw his picture,
p28
aVI thought that his superpowers came from his super collar.
p29
aa(lp30
V(Laughter)
p31
aa(lp32
VBut now I know it was all in his smile.
p33
aa(lp34
VAnother aha! moment came from a 2010 Wayne State University research project
p35
aVthat looked into pre-1950s baseball cards of Major League players.
p36
aVThe researchers found that the span of a player's smile
p37
aVcould actually predict the span of his life.
p38
aVPlayers who didn't smile in their pictures
p39
aVlived an average of only 72.9 years,
p40
aVwhere players with beaming smiles
p41
aVlived an average of almost 80 years.
p42
aa(lp43
V(Laughter)
p44
aa(lp45
VThe good news is that we're actually born smiling.
p46
aVUsing 3D ultrasound technology,
p47
aVwe can now see that developing babies appear to smile,
p48
aVeven in the womb.
p49
aVWhen they're born, babies continue to smile \u2014
p50
aVinitially, mostly in their sleep.
p51
aVAnd even blind babies smile
p52
aVto the sound of the human voice.
p53
aVSmiling is one of the most basic, biologically uniform
p54
aVexpressions of all humans.
p55
aa(lp56
VIn studies conducted in Papua New Guinea,
p57
aVPaul Ekman, the world's most renowned researcher on facial expressions,
p58
aVfound that even members of the Fore tribe,
p59
aVwho were completely disconnected from Western culture,
p60
aVand also known for their unusual cannibalism rituals,
p61
aa(lp62
V(Laughter)
p63
aa(lp64
Vattributed smiles to descriptions of situations
p65
aVthe same way you and I would.
p66
aVSo from Papua New Guinea
p67
aVto Hollywood
p68
aVall the way to modern art in Beijing,
p69
aVwe smile often,
p70
aVand use smiles to express joy and satisfaction.
p71
aa(lp72
VHow many people here in this room smile more than 20 times per day?
p73
aVRaise your hand if you do.
p74
aVOh, wow.
p75
aVOutside of this room,
p76
aVmore than a third of us smile more than 20 times per day,
p77
aVwhereas less than 14 percent of us smile less than five.
p78
aVIn fact, those with the most amazing superpowers are actually children,
p79
aVwho smile as many as 400 times per day.
p80
aa(lp81
VHave you ever wondered why being around children,
p82
aVwho smile so frequently, makes you smile very often?
p83
aVA recent study at Uppsala University in Sweden
p84
aVfound that it's very difficult to frown when looking at someone who smiles.
p85
aVYou ask why?
p86
aVBecause smiling is evolutionarily contagious,
p87
aVand it suppresses the control we usually have on our facial muscles.
p88
aVMimicking a smile and experiencing it physically
p89
aVhelps us understand whether our smile is fake or real,
p90
aVso we can understand the emotional state of the smiler.
p91
aa(lp92
VIn a recent mimicking study
p93
aVat the University of Clermont-Ferrand in France,
p94
aVsubjects were asked to determine whether a smile was real or fake
p95
aVwhile holding a pencil in their mouth to repress smiling muscles.
p96
aVWithout the pencil, subjects were excellent judges,
p97
aVbut with the pencil in their mouth \u2014
p98
aVwhen they could not mimic the smile they saw \u2014
p99
aVtheir judgment was impaired.
p100
aa(lp101
V(Laughter)
p102
aa(lp103
VIn addition to theorizing on evolution in "The Origin of Species,"
p104
aVCharles Darwin also wrote the facial feedback response theory.
p105
aVHis theory states that the act of smiling itself actually makes us feel better,
p106
aVrather than smiling being merely a result of feeling good.
p107
aVIn his study, Darwin actually cited a French neurologist, Guillaume Duchenne,
p108
aVwho sent electric jolts to facial muscles to induce and stimulate smiles.
p109
aVPlease, don't try this at home.
p110
aa(lp111
V(Laughter)
p112
aa(lp113
VIn a related German study,
p114
aVresearchers used fMRI imaging to measure brain activity
p115
aVbefore and after injecting Botox to suppress smiling muscles.
p116
aVThe finding supported Darwin's theory,
p117
aVby showing that facial feedback
p118
aVmodifies the neural processing of emotional content in the brain,
p119
aVin a way that helps us feel better when we smile.
p120
aVSmiling stimulates our brain reward mechanism
p121
aVin a way that even chocolate \u2014
p122
aVa well-regarded pleasure inducer \u2014
p123
aVcannot match.
p124
aa(lp125
VBritish researchers found that one smile
p126
aVcan generate the same level of brain stimulation
p127
aVas up to 2,000 bars of chocolate.
p128
aa(lp129
V(Laughter)
p130
aa(lp131
VWait \u2014
p132
aVThe same study found that smiling is as stimulating
p133
aVas receiving up to 16,000 pounds sterling in cash.
p134
aa(lp135
V(Laughter)
p136
aa(lp137
VThat's like 25 grand a smile.
p138
aVIt's not bad.
p139
aVAnd think about it this way:
p140
aV25,000 times 400 \u2014
p141
aVquite a few kids out there feel like Mark Zuckerberg every day.
p142
aa(lp143
V(Laughter)
p144
aa(lp145
VAnd unlike lots of chocolate,
p146
aVlots of smiling can actually make you healthier.
p147
aVSmiling can help reduce the level of stress-enhancing hormones
p148
aVlike cortisol, adrenaline and dopamine,
p149
aVincrease the level of mood-enhancing hormones like endorphins,
p150
aVand reduce overall blood pressure.
p151
aa(lp152
VAnd if that's not enough,
p153
aVsmiling can actually make you look good in the eyes of others.
p154
aVA recent study at Penn State University found that when you smile,
p155
aVyou don't only appear to be more likable and courteous,
p156
aVbut you actually appear to be more competent.
p157
aa(lp158
VSo whenever you want to look great and competent,
p159
aVreduce your stress or improve your marriage,
p160
aVor feel as if you just had a whole stack of high-quality chocolate
p161
aVwithout incurring the caloric cost,
p162
aVor as if you found 25 grand in a pocket of an old jacket you hadn't worn for ages,
p163
aVor whenever you want to tap into a superpower
p164
aVthat will help you and everyone around you
p165
aVlive a longer, healthier, happier life,
p166
aVsmile.
