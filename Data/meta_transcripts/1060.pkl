VI'm going to be talking to you
p4
aVabout how we can tap
p5
aVa really underutilized resource in health care,
p6
aVwhich is the patient,
p7
aVor, as I like to use the scientific term,
p8
aVpeople.
p9
aVBecause we are all patients, we are all people.
p10
aVEven doctors are patients at some point.
p11
aVSo I want to talk about that
p12
aVas an opportunity
p13
aVthat we really have failed to engage with very well in this country
p14
aVand, in fact, worldwide.
p15
aVIf you want to get at the big part \u2014
p16
aVI mean from a public health level, where my training is \u2014
p17
aVyou're looking at behavioral issues.
p18
aVYou're looking at things where people are actually given information,
p19
aVand they're not following through with it.
p20
aVIt's a problem that manifests itself in diabetes,
p21
aVobesity, many forms of heart disease,
p22
aVeven some forms of cancer \u2014 when you think of smoking.
p23
aVThose are all behaviors where people know what they're supposed to do.
p24
aVThey know what they're supposed to be doing,
p25
aVbut they're not doing it.
p26
aa(lp27
VNow behavior change is something
p28
aVthat is a long-standing problem in medicine.
p29
aVIt goes all the way back to Aristotle.
p30
aVAnd doctors hate it, right?
p31
aVI mean, they complain about it all the time.
p32
aVWe talk about it in terms of engagement, or non-compliance.
p33
aVWhen people don't take their pills,
p34
aVwhen people don't follow doctors' orders \u2014
p35
aVthese are behavior problems.
p36
aVBut for as much as clinical medicine
p37
aVagonizes over behavior change,
p38
aVthere's not a lot of work done
p39
aVin terms of trying to fix that problem.
p40
aVSo the crux of it
p41
aVcomes down to this notion of decision-making \u2014
p42
aVgiving information to people in a form
p43
aVthat doesn't just educate them
p44
aVor inform them,
p45
aVbut actually leads them to make better decisions,
p46
aVbetter choices in their lives.
p47
aa(lp48
VOne part of medicine, though,
p49
aVhas faced the problem of behavior change pretty well,
p50
aVand that's dentistry.
p51
aVDentistry might seem \u2014 and I think it is \u2014
p52
aVmany dentists would have to acknowledge
p53
aVit's somewhat of a mundane backwater of medicine.
p54
aVNot a lot of cool, sexy stuff happening in dentistry.
p55
aVBut they have really taken this problem of behavior change
p56
aVand solved it.
p57
aVIt's the one great preventive health success
p58
aVwe have in our health care system.
p59
aVPeople brush and floss their teeth.
p60
aVThey don't do it as much as they should, but they do it.
p61
aa(lp62
VSo I'm going to talk about one experiment
p63
aVthat a few dentists in Connecticut
p64
aVcooked up about 30 years ago.
p65
aVSo this is an old experiment, but it's a really good one,
p66
aVbecause it was very simple,
p67
aVso it's an easy story to tell.
p68
aVSo these Connecticut dentists decided
p69
aVthat they wanted to get people to brush their teeth and floss their teeth more often,
p70
aVand they were going to use one variable:
p71
aVthey wanted to scare them.
p72
aVThey wanted to tell them how bad it would be
p73
aVif they didn't brush and floss their teeth.
p74
aVThey had a big patient population.
p75
aVThey divided them up into two groups.
p76
aVThey had a low-fear population,
p77
aVwhere they basically gave them a 13-minute presentation,
p78
aVall based in science,
p79
aVbut told them that, if you didn't brush and floss your teeth,
p80
aVyou could get gum disease. If you get gum disease, you will lose your teeth,
p81
aVbut you'll get dentures, and it won't be that bad.
p82
aVSo that was the low-fear group.
p83
aVThe high-fear group, they laid it on really thick.
p84
aVThey showed bloody gums.
p85
aVThey showed puss oozing out from between their teeth.
p86
aVThey told them that their teeth were going to fall out.
p87
aVThey said that they could have infections
p88
aVthat would spread from their jaws to other parts of their bodies,
p89
aVand ultimately, yes, they would lose their teeth.
p90
aVThey would get dentures, and if you got dentures,
p91
aVyou weren't going to be able to eat corn-on-the-cob,
p92
aVyou weren't going to be able to eat apples,
p93
aVyou weren't going to be able to eat steak.
p94
aVYou'll eat mush for the rest of your life.
p95
aVSo go brush and floss your teeth.
p96
aVThat was the message. That was the experiment.
p97
aa(lp98
VNow they measured one other variable.
p99
aVThey wanted to capture one other variable,
p100
aVwhich was the patients' sense of efficacy.
p101
aVThis was the notion of whether the patients felt
p102
aVthat they actually would go ahead and brush and floss their teeth.
p103
aVSo they asked them at the beginning,
p104
aV"Do you think you'll actually be able to stick with this program?"
p105
aVAnd the people who said, "Yeah, yeah. I'm pretty good about that,"
p106
aVthey were characterized as high efficacy,
p107
aVand the people who said,
p108
aV"Eh, I never get around to brushing and flossing as much as I should,"
p109
aVthey were characterized as low efficacy.
p110
aVSo the upshot was this.
p111
aVThe upshot of this experiment
p112
aVwas that fear was not really a primary driver
p113
aVof the behavior at all.
p114
aVThe people who brushed and flossed their teeth
p115
aVwere not necessarily the people
p116
aVwho were really scared about what would happen \u2014
p117
aVit's the people who simply felt that they had the capacity
p118
aVto change their behavior.
p119
aVSo fear showed up as not really the driver.
p120
aVIt was the sense of efficacy.
p121
aa(lp122
VSo I want to isolate this,
p123
aVbecause it was a great observation \u2014
p124
aV30 years ago, right, 30 years ago \u2014
p125
aVand it's one that's laid fallow in research.
p126
aVIt was a notion that really came out
p127
aVof Albert Bandura's work,
p128
aVwho studied whether
p129
aVpeople could get a sense of empowerment.
p130
aVThe notion of efficacy basically boils down to one \u2014 that
p131
aVif somebody believes that they have the capacity to change their behavior.
p132
aVIn health care terms, you could characterize this
p133
aVas whether or not somebody feels
p134
aVthat they see a path towards better health,
p135
aVthat they can actually see their way towards getting better health,
p136
aVand that's a very important notion.
p137
aVIt's an amazing notion.
p138
aVWe don't really know how to manipulate it, though, that well.
p139
aVExcept, maybe we do.
p140
aa(lp141
VSo fear doesn't work, right? Fear doesn't work.
p142
aVAnd this is a great example
p143
aVof how we haven't learned that lesson at all.
p144
aVThis is a campaign from the American Diabetes Association.
p145
aVThis is still the way we're communicating messages about health.
p146
aVI mean, I showed my three-year-old this slide last night,
p147
aVand he's like, "Papa, why is an ambulance in these people's homes?"
p148
aVAnd I had to explain, "They're trying to scare people."
p149
aVAnd I don't know if it works.
p150
aa(lp151
VNow here's what does work:
p152
aVpersonalized information works.
p153
aVAgain, Bandura recognized this
p154
aVyears ago, decades ago.
p155
aVWhen you give people specific information
p156
aVabout their health, where they stand,
p157
aVand where they want to get to, where they might get to,
p158
aVthat path, that notion of a path \u2014
p159
aVthat tends to work for behavior change.
p160
aVSo let me just spool it out a little bit.
p161
aVSo you start with personalized data, personalized information
p162
aVthat comes from an individual,
p163
aVand then you need to connect it to their lives.
p164
aVYou need to connect it to their lives,
p165
aVhopefully not in a fear-based way, but one that they understand.
p166
aVOkay, I know where I sit. I know where I'm situated.
p167
aVAnd that doesn't just work for me in terms of abstract numbers \u2014
p168
aVthis overload of health information
p169
aVthat we're inundated with.
p170
aVBut it actually hits home.
p171
aVIt's not just hitting us in our heads; it's hitting us in our hearts.
p172
aVThere's an emotional connection to information
p173
aVbecause it's from us.
p174
aVThat information then needs to be connected to choices,
p175
aVneeds to be connected to a range of options,
p176
aVdirections that we might go to \u2014
p177
aVtrade-offs, benefits.
p178
aVFinally, we need to be presented with a clear point of action.
p179
aVWe need to connect the information
p180
aValways with the action,
p181
aVand then that action feeds back
p182
aVinto different information,
p183
aVand it creates, of course, a feedback loop.
p184
aa(lp185
VNow this is a very well-observed and well-established notion
p186
aVfor behavior change.
p187
aVBut the problem is that things \u2014 in the upper-right corner there \u2014
p188
aVpersonalized data, it's been pretty hard to come by.
p189
aVIt's a difficult and expensive commodity,
p190
aVuntil now.
p191
aVSo I'm going to give you an example, a very simple example of how this works.
p192
aVSo we've all seen these. These are the "your speed limit" signs.
p193
aVYou've seen them all around,
p194
aVespecially these days as radars are cheaper.
p195
aVAnd here's how they work in the feedback loop.
p196
aVSo you start with the personalized data
p197
aVwhere the speed limit on the road that you are at that point
p198
aVis 25,
p199
aVand, of course, you're going faster than that.
p200
aVWe always are. We're always going above the speed limit.
p201
aVThe choice in this case is pretty simple.
p202
aVWe either keep going fast, or we slow down.
p203
aVWe should probably slow down,
p204
aVand that point of action is probably now.
p205
aVWe should take our foot off the pedal right now,
p206
aVand generally we do. These things are shown to be pretty effective
p207
aVin terms of getting people to slow down.
p208
aVThey reduce speeds by about five to 10 percent.
p209
aVThey last for about five miles,
p210
aVin which case we put our foot back on the pedal.
p211
aVBut it works, and it even has some health repercussions.
p212
aVYour blood pressure might drop a little bit.
p213
aVMaybe there's fewer accidents, so there's public health benefits.
p214
aa(lp215
VBut by and large, this is a feedback loop
p216
aVthat's so nifty and too rare.
p217
aVBecause in health care, most health care,
p218
aVthe data is very removed from the action.
p219
aVIt's very difficult to line things up so neatly.
p220
aVBut we have an opportunity.
p221
aVSo I want to talk about, I want to shift now to think about
p222
aVhow we deliver health information in this country,
p223
aVhow we actually get information.
p224
aVThis is a pharmaceutical ad.
p225
aVActually, it's a spoof. It's not a real pharmaceutical ad.
p226
aVNobody's had the brilliant idea
p227
aVof calling their drug Havidol quite yet.
p228
aVBut it looks completely right.
p229
aVSo it's exactly the way we get
p230
aVhealth information and pharmaceutical information,
p231
aVand it just sounds perfect.
p232
aVAnd then we turn the page of the magazine,
p233
aVand we see this \u2014
p234
aVnow this is the page the FDA requires pharmaceutical companies
p235
aVto put into their ads, or to follow their ads,
p236
aVand to me, this is one of the most  cynical exercises in medicine.
p237
aVBecause we know.
p238
aVWho among us would actually say that people read this?
p239
aVAnd who among us would actually say
p240
aVthat people who do try to read this
p241
aVactually get anything out of it?
p242
aVThis is a bankrupt effort
p243
aVat communicating health information.
p244
aVThere is no good faith in this.
p245
aa(lp246
VSo this is a different approach.
p247
aVThis is an approach that has been developed
p248
aVby a couple researchers at Dartmouth Medical School,
p249
aVLisa Schwartz and Steven Woloshin.
p250
aVAnd they created this thing called the "drug facts box."
p251
aVThey took inspiration from, of all things,
p252
aVCap'n Crunch.
p253
aVThey went to the nutritional information box
p254
aVand saw that what works for cereal, works for our food,
p255
aVactually helps people understand what's in their food.
p256
aVGod forbid we should use that same standard
p257
aVthat we make Cap'n Crunch live by
p258
aVand bring it to drug companies.
p259
aVSo let me just walk through this quickly.
p260
aVIt says very clearly what the drug is for, specifically who it is good for,
p261
aVso you can start to personalize your understanding
p262
aVof whether the information is relevant to you
p263
aVor whether the drug is relevant to you.
p264
aVYou can understand exactly what the benefits are.
p265
aVIt isn't this kind of vague promise that it's going to work no matter what,
p266
aVbut you get the statistics for how effective it is.
p267
aVAnd finally, you understand what those choices are.
p268
aVYou can start to unpack the choices involved
p269
aVbecause of the side effects.
p270
aVEvery time you take a drug, you're walking into a possible side effect.
p271
aVSo it spells those out in very clean terms,
p272
aVand that works.
p273
aa(lp274
VSo I love this. I love that drug facts box.
p275
aVAnd so I was thinking about,
p276
aVwhat's an opportunity that I could have
p277
aVto help people understand information?
p278
aVWhat's another latent body of information that's out there
p279
aVthat people are really not putting to use?
p280
aVAnd so I came up with this: lab test results.
p281
aVBlood test results are this great source of information.
p282
aVThey're packed with information.
p283
aVThey're just not for us. They're not for people. They're not for patients.
p284
aVThey go right to doctors.
p285
aVAnd God forbid \u2014 I think many doctors, if you really asked them,
p286
aVthey don't really understand all this stuff either.
p287
aVThis is the worst presented information.
p288
aVYou ask Tufte, and he would say,
p289
aV"Yes, this is the absolute worst presentation of information possible."
p290
aa(lp291
VWhat we did at Wired
p292
aVwas we went, and I got our graphic design department
p293
aVto re-imagine these lab reports.
p294
aVSo that's what I want to walk you through.
p295
aVSo this is the general blood work before,
p296
aVand this is the after, this is what we came up with.
p297
aVThe after takes what was four pages \u2014
p298
aVthat previous slide was actually
p299
aVthe first of four pages of data
p300
aVthat's just the general blood work.
p301
aVIt goes on and on and on, all these values, all these numbers you don't know.
p302
aVThis is our one-page summary.
p303
aVWe use the notion of color.
p304
aVIt's an amazing notion that color could be used.
p305
aVSo on the top-level you have your overall results,
p306
aVthe things that might jump out at you from the fine print.
p307
aVThen you can drill down
p308
aVand understand how actually we put your level in context,
p309
aVand we use color to illustrate
p310
aVexactly where your value falls.
p311
aVIn this case, this patient is slightly at risk of diabetes
p312
aVbecause of their glucose level.
p313
aa(lp314
VLikewise, you can go over your lipids
p315
aVand, again, understand what your overall cholesterol level is
p316
aVand then break down into the HDL and the LDL if you so choose.
p317
aVBut again, always using color
p318
aVand personalized proximity
p319
aVto that information.
p320
aVAll those other values,
p321
aVall those pages and pages of values that are full of nothing,
p322
aVwe summarize.
p323
aVWe tell you that you're okay, you're normal.
p324
aVBut you don't have to wade through it. You don't have to go through the junk.
p325
aVAnd then we do two other very important things
p326
aVthat kind of help fill in this feedback loop:
p327
aVwe help people understand in a little more detail
p328
aVwhat these values are and what they might indicate.
p329
aVAnd then we go a further step \u2014 we tell them what they can do.
p330
aVWe give them some insight
p331
aVinto what choices they can make, what actions they can take.
p332
aVSo that's our general blood work test.
p333
aa(lp334
VThen we went to CRP test.
p335
aVIn this case, it's a sin of omission.
p336
aVThey have this huge amount of space,
p337
aVand they don't use it for anything, so we do.
p338
aVNow the CRP test is often done
p339
aVfollowing a cholesterol test,
p340
aVor in conjunction with a cholesterol test.
p341
aVSo we take the bold step
p342
aVof putting the cholesterol information on the same page,
p343
aVwhich is the way the doctor is going to evaluate it.
p344
aVSo we thought the patient might actually want to know the context as well.
p345
aVIt's a protein that shows up
p346
aVwhen your blood vessels might be inflamed,
p347
aVwhich might be a risk for heart disease.
p348
aVWhat you're actually measuring
p349
aVis spelled out in clean language.
p350
aVThen we use the information
p351
aVthat's already in the lab report.
p352
aVWe use the person's age and their gender
p353
aVto start to fill in the personalized risks.
p354
aVSo we start to use the data we have
p355
aVto run a very simple calculation
p356
aVthat's on all sorts of online calculators
p357
aVto get a sense of what the actual risk is.
p358
aa(lp359
VThe last one I'll show you is a PSA test.
p360
aVHere's the before, and here's the after.
p361
aVNow a lot of our effort on this one \u2014
p362
aVas many of you probably know,
p363
aVa PSA test is a very controversial test.
p364
aVIt's used to test for prostate cancer,
p365
aVbut there are all sorts of reasons
p366
aVwhy your prostate might be enlarged.
p367
aVAnd so we spent a good deal of our time
p368
aVindicating that.
p369
aVWe again personalized the risks.
p370
aVSo this patient is in their 50s,
p371
aVso we can actually give them a very precise estimate
p372
aVof what their risk for prostate cancer is.
p373
aVIn this case it's about 25 percent, based on that.
p374
aVAnd then again, the follow-up actions.
p375
aa(lp376
VSo our cost for this was less than 10,000 dollars, all right.
p377
aVThat's what Wired magazine spent on this.
p378
aVWhy is Wired magazine doing this?
p379
aV(Laughter)
p380
aVQuest Diagnostics and LabCorp,
p381
aVthe two largest lab testing companies \u2014
p382
aVlast year, they made profits of over 700 million dollars
p383
aVand over 500 million dollars respectively.
p384
aVNow this is not a problem of resources;
p385
aVthis is a problem of incentives.
p386
aVWe need to recognize that the target of this information
p387
aVshould not be the doctor, should not be the insurance company.
p388
aVIt should be the patient.
p389
aVIt's the person who actually, in the end,
p390
aVis going to be having to change their lives
p391
aVand then start adopting new behaviors.
p392
aa(lp393
VThis is information that is incredibly powerful.
p394
aVIt's an incredibly powerful catalyst to change.
p395
aVBut we're not using it. It's just sitting there.
p396
aVIt's being lost.
p397
aVSo I want to just offer four questions
p398
aVthat every patient should ask,
p399
aVbecause I don't actually expect people
p400
aVto start developing these lab test reports.
p401
aVBut you can create your own feedback loop.
p402
aVAnybody can create their feedback loop by asking these simple questions:
p403
aVCan I have my results?
p404
aVAnd the only acceptable answer is \u2014
p405
aV(Audience: Yes.) \u2014 yes.
p406
aVWhat does this mean? Help me understand what the data is.
p407
aVWhat are my options? What choices are now on the table?
p408
aVAnd then, what's next?
p409
aVHow do I integrate this information
p410
aVinto the longer course of my life?
p411
aa(lp412
VSo I want to wind up by just showing
p413
aVthat people have the capacity to understand this information.
p414
aVThis is not beyond the grasp of ordinary people.
p415
aVYou do not need to have the education level of people in this room.
p416
aVOrdinary people are capable of understanding this information,
p417
aVif we only go to the effort of presenting it to them
p418
aVin a form that they can engage with.
p419
aVAnd engagement is essential here,
p420
aVbecause it's not just giving them information;
p421
aVit's giving them an opportunity to act.
p422
aVThat's what engagement is. It's different from compliance.
p423
aVIt works totally different from the way we talk about behavior
p424
aVin medicine today.
p425
aVAnd this information is out there.
p426
aa(lp427
VI've been talking today about latent information,
p428
aVall this information that exists in the system
p429
aVthat we're not putting to use.
p430
aVBut there are all sorts of other bodies of information
p431
aVthat are coming online,
p432
aVand we need to recognize the capacity of this information
p433
aVto engage people, to help people
p434
aVand to change the course of their lives.
p435
aa(lp436
VThank you very much.
