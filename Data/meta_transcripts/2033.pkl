VI want to talk to you about one thing
p4
aVand just one thing only,
p5
aVand this has to do with when people ask me,
p6
aVwhat do you do?
p7
aVTo which I usually respond,
p8
aVI do computer music.
p9
aa(lp10
VNow, a number of people
p11
aVjust stop talking to me right then and there,
p12
aVand the rest who are left usually have
p13
aVthis blank look in their eye,
p14
aVas if to say, what does that mean?
p15
aVAnd I feel like I'm actually depriving them
p16
aVof information by telling them this,
p17
aVat which point I usually panic
p18
aVand spit out the first thing that comes to my mind,
p19
aVwhich is, I have no idea what I'm doing.
p20
aVWhich is true.
p21
aVThat's usually followed by a second thought,
p22
aVwhich is, whatever it is that I'm doing,
p23
aVI love it.
p24
aVAnd today, I want to, well,
p25
aVshare with you something I love,
p26
aVand also why.
p27
aa(lp28
VAnd I think we'll begin with just this question:
p29
aVWhat is computer music?
p30
aVAnd I'm going to try to do my best to provide a definition,
p31
aVmaybe by telling you a story
p32
aVthat goes through some of the stuff
p33
aVI've been working on.
p34
aa(lp35
VAnd the first thing, I think, in our story
p36
aVis going to be something called ChucK.
p37
aVNow, ChucK is a programming language for music,
p38
aVand it's open-source, it's freely available,
p39
aVand I like to think that it crashes equally well
p40
aVon all modern operating systems.
p41
aVAnd instead of telling you more about it,
p42
aVI'm just going to give you a demo.
p43
aVBy the way, I'm just going to nerd out
p44
aVfor just a few minutes here,
p45
aVso I would say, don't freak out.
p46
aVIn fact, I would invite all of you to join me
p47
aVin just geeking out.
p48
aVIf you've never written a line of code before in your life,
p49
aVdo not worry.
p50
aVI'll bet you'll be able to come along on this.
p51
aa(lp52
VFirst thing I'm going to do is to make
p53
aVa sine wave oscillator,
p54
aVand we're going to called the sine wave generator
p55
aV"Ge."
p56
aVAnd then we're going to connect "Ge" to the DAC.
p57
aVNow this is kind of the abstraction
p58
aVfor the sound output on my computer. Okay?
p59
aVSo I've connected myself into the speaker.
p60
aVNext, I'm going to say my frequency
p61
aVis 440 hertz,
p62
aVand I'm going to let time advance
p63
aVby two seconds through this operation.
p64
aVAll right, so if I were to play this \u2014
p65
aV(Tone) \u2014
p66
aVyou would hear a sine wave at 440 hertz for two seconds.
p67
aVOkay, great. Now I'm going to copy and paste this,
p68
aVand then just change some of these numbers,
p69
aV220.5, 440 I shall leave it as that,
p70
aVand .5 and 880.
p71
aVBy doubling the frequency,
p72
aVwe're actually going up in successive octaves,
p73
aVand then we have this sequence \u2014
p74
aV(Tones) \u2014 of tones.
p75
aVOkay, great, now I can imagine creating
p76
aVall kinds of really horrible
p77
aVsingle sine wave pieces of music with this,
p78
aVbut I'm going to do something that computers are really good at,
p79
aVwhich is repetition.
p80
aVI'm going to put this all in a while loop,
p81
aVand you actually don't need to indent,
p82
aVbut this is purely for aesthetic reasons.
p83
aVIt's good practice.
p84
aVAnd when we do this \u2014
p85
aV(Tones) \u2014
p86
aVthat's going to go on for a while.
p87
aVIn fact, it's probably not going to stop
p88
aVuntil this computer disintegrates.
p89
aVAnd I can't really empirically prove that to you,
p90
aVbut I hope you'll believe me when I say that.
p91
aVNext, I'm going to replace this 220
p92
aVby math.random2f.
p93
aVI'm going to generate a random number
p94
aVbetween 30 and 1,000 and send that
p95
aVto the frequency of me.
p96
aVAnd I'm going to do this every half a second.
p97
aV(Tones)
p98
aVLet's do this every 200 milliseconds.
p99
aV(Tones)
p100
aVOne hundred.
p101
aV(Tones)
p102
aVAll right.
p103
aVAt this point, we've reached something
p104
aVthat I would like to think of as
p105
aVthe canonical computer music.
p106
aVThis is, to me, the sound that mainframes
p107
aVare supposed to be making
p108
aVwhen they're thinking really hard.
p109
aVIt's this sound, it's like,
p110
aVthe square root of five million.
p111
aa(lp112
VSo is this computer music?
p113
aVYeah, I guess by definition,
p114
aVit's kind of computer music.
p115
aVIt's probably not the kind of music you would listen to
p116
aVcruising down the highway,
p117
aVbut it's a foundation of computer-generated music,
p118
aVand using ChucK,
p119
aVwe've actually been building instruments
p120
aVin the Stanford Laptop Orchestra,
p121
aVbased right here at Stanford Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics.
p122
aa(lp123
VNow the Laptop Orchestra is an ensemble of laptops,
p124
aVhumans and special hemispherical speaker arrays.
p125
aVNow the reason we have these
p126
aVis so that for the instruments that we create
p127
aVout of the laptop, we want the sound to come
p128
aVout of somewhere near the instrument
p129
aVand the performer,
p130
aVkind of much like a traditional, acoustic instrument.
p131
aVLike, if I were to play a violin here,
p132
aVthe sound would naturally not come out of
p133
aVthe P.A. system, but from the artifact itself.
p134
aVSo these speakers are meant to emulate that.
p135
aVIn fact, I'm going to show you
p136
aVhow we actually built them.
p137
aVThe first step is to go to IKEA
p138
aVand buy a salad bowl.
p139
aVThis is an 11-inch Blanda Matt.
p140
aVThat's the actual name,
p141
aVand I actually use one of these
p142
aVto make salad at home as well, I kid you not.
p143
aVAnd the first step is you turn it upside down,
p144
aVand then you drill holes in them,
p145
aVsix holes per hemi,
p146
aVand then make a base plate,
p147
aVput car speaker drivers in them
p148
aValong with amplifiers in the enclosure,
p149
aVand you put that all together and you have
p150
aVthese hemispherical speaker arrays.
p151
aVAdd people, add laptops,
p152
aVyou have a laptop orchestra.
p153
aa(lp154
VAnd what might a laptop orchestra sound like?
p155
aVWell, let me give you a demonstration
p156
aVof about 200 instruments we've created so far
p157
aVfor the Laptop Orchestra.
p158
aVAnd what I'm going to do is actually come over to this thing.
p159
aVThis thing I have in front of me
p160
aVactually used to be a commodity gaming controller
p161
aVcalled a Gametrak.
p162
aVThis thing actually has a glove you can put on your hands.
p163
aVIt's tethered to the base,
p164
aVand this will track the position of your hands
p165
aVin real time.
p166
aVIt was originally designed as a golfing controller
p167
aVto detect the motion of your swing.
p168
aVThat turned out to be a rather large
p169
aVcommercial non-success,
p170
aVat which point they slashed prices to 10 dollars,
p171
aVat which point computer music researchers
p172
aVsaid, "This is awesome!
p173
aVWe can prototype instruments out of this."
p174
aa(lp175
VSo let me show you one instrument we've created,
p176
aVone of many, and this instrument
p177
aVis called "Twilight,"
p178
aVand it's meant to go with this metaphor
p179
aVof pulling a sound out of the ground.
p180
aVSo let me see if this will work.
p181
aa(lp182
V(Music)
p183
aa(lp184
VAnd put it back.
p185
aVAnd then if you go to the left,
p186
aVright,
p187
aVit sounds like an elephant in pain.
p188
aa(lp189
VThis is a slightly metallic sound.
p190
aVTurn it just a bit.
p191
aa(lp192
V(Music)
p193
aVIt's like a hovering car.
p194
aa(lp195
VOkay.
p196
aa(lp197
VThis third one is a ratchet-like interaction, so
p198
aVlet me turn it up.
p199
aa(lp200
V(Music)
p201
aa(lp202
VSo it's a slightly different interaction.
p203
aa(lp204
VThe fourth one is a drone.
p205
aa(lp206
V(Music)
p207
aVAnd finally, let's see,
p208
aVthis is a totally different interaction,
p209
aVand I think you have to imagine that there's
p210
aVthis giant invisible drum sitting right here on stage,
p211
aVand I'm going to bang it.
p212
aV(Drum)
p213
aV(Laughter)
p214
aVSo there we go, so that's one of many instruments
p215
aVin the Laptop Orchestra.
p216
aa(lp217
V(Applause)
p218
aa(lp219
VThank you.
p220
aa(lp221
VAnd when you put that together,
p222
aVyou get something that sounds like this.
p223
aa(lp224
V(Music)
p225
aa(lp226
VOkay, and so, I think from the experience
p227
aVof building a lot of instruments for the Laptop Orchestra,
p228
aVand I think from the curiosity of wondering,
p229
aVwhat if we took these
p230
aVhopefully expressive instruments
p231
aVand we brought it to a lot of people,
p232
aVplus then a healthy bout of insanity \u2014
p233
aVput those three things together \u2014
p234
aVled to me actually co-founding a startup company
p235
aVin 2008 called Smule.
p236
aa(lp237
VNow Smule's mission is to create
p238
aVexpressive, mobile music things,
p239
aVand one of the first musical instruments
p240
aVwe created is called Ocarina.
p241
aVAnd I'm going to just demo this for you real quick.
p242
aVSo Ocarina \u2014
p243
aV(Music) \u2014
p244
aVis based on this ancient flute-like instrument
p245
aVcalled the ocarina,
p246
aVand this one is the four-hole English pendant configuration,
p247
aVand you're literally blowing into the microphone
p248
aVto make the sound.
p249
aVAnd there's actually a little ChucK script
p250
aVrunning in here that's detecting
p251
aVthe strength of your blowing
p252
aVand also synthesizing the sound.
p253
aV(Music)
p254
aVAnd vibrato is mapped to the accelerometer,
p255
aVso you can get \u2014
p256
aV(Music)
p257
aVAll right. So let me play a little ditty for you,
p258
aVa little Bach.
p259
aVAnd here, you'll hear a little accompaniment with the melody.
p260
aVThe accompaniment actually follows the melody,
p261
aVnot the other way around.
p262
aa(lp263
V(Music)
p264
aa(lp265
VAnd this was designed
p266
aVto let you take your time
p267
aVand figure out where your expressive space is,
p268
aVand you can just hang out here
p269
aVfor a while, for a really dramatic effect, if you want,
p270
aVand whenever you're ready \u2014
p271
aa(lp272
V(Music)
p273
aa(lp274
VAnd on these longer notes,
p275
aVI'm going to use more vibrato
p276
aVtowards the end of the notes
p277
aVto give it a little bit more of an expressive quality.
p278
aa(lp279
V(Music)
p280
aa(lp281
VHuh, that's a nice chord to end this excerpt on.
p282
aa(lp283
V(Applause)
p284
aa(lp285
VThank you.
p286
aa(lp287
VSo I think a good question to ask about Ocarina is,
p288
aVis this a toy or it an instrument? Maybe it's both,
p289
aVbut for me, I think the more important question is,
p290
aVis it expressive?
p291
aVAnd at the same time, I think
p292
aVcreating these types of instruments
p293
aVasks a question about the role of technology,
p294
aVand its place for how we make music.
p295
aVApparently, for example,
p296
aVnot that long ago, like only a hundred years ago \u2014
p297
aVthat's not that long in the course of human history \u2014
p298
aVfamilies back then
p299
aVused to make music together
p300
aVas a common form of entertainment.
p301
aVI don't think that's really happening
p302
aVthat much anymore.
p303
aVYou know, this is before radio, before recording.
p304
aVIn the last hundred years, with all this technology,
p305
aVwe now have more access to music
p306
aVas listeners and consumers,
p307
aVbut somehow, I think we're making less music
p308
aVthan ever before.
p309
aVI'm not sure why that would be.
p310
aVMaybe it's because it's too easy just to hit play.
p311
aVAnd while listening to music is wonderful,
p312
aVthere's a special joy to making music
p313
aVthat's all its own.
p314
aVAnd I think that's one part
p315
aVof the goal of why I do what I do
p316
aVis kind of to take us back to the past a little bit. Right?
p317
aa(lp318
VNow, if that's one goal, the other goal
p319
aVis to look to the future and think about
p320
aVwhat kind of new musical things can we make
p321
aVthat we don't perhaps yet have names for
p322
aVthat's enabled by technology, but ultimately
p323
aVmight change the way that humans make music.
p324
aVAnd I'll just give you one example here,
p325
aVand this is Ocarina's other feature.
p326
aVThis is a globe,
p327
aVand here you're actually listening
p328
aVto other users of Ocarina
p329
aVblow into their iPhones to play something.
p330
aVThis is "G.I.R." from Texas,
p331
aV"R.I.K." I don't know why it's these three-letter names today, Los Angeles.
p332
aVThey're all playing pretty,
p333
aVsomewhat minimal music here.
p334
aa(lp335
V(Music)
p336
aa(lp337
VAnd the idea with this is that, well,
p338
aVtechnology should not be foregrounded here,
p339
aVand \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p340
aVwe've actually opened this up.
p341
aVThe first thought is that, hey, you know
p342
aVthere's somebody somewhere out there
p343
aVplaying some music,
p344
aVand this is a small but I think important
p345
aVhuman connection to make
p346
aVthat perhaps the technology affords.
p347
aa(lp348
VAs a final example,
p349
aVand perhaps my favorite example,
p350
aVis that in the wake of the 2011 earthquake
p351
aVand tsunami disaster in Japan,
p352
aVa woman reached out in one of our singing apps
p353
aVto try to get people to join in to sing with her
p354
aVon a version of "Lean on Me."
p355
aVNow, in these apps, there's this thing that allows
p356
aVany user to add their voice
p357
aVto an existing performance by any other user
p358
aVor group of users,
p359
aVso in some sense, she's created this kind of
p360
aVglobal ad hoc corral of strangers,
p361
aVand within weeks, thousands of people
p362
aVjoined in on this,
p363
aVand you can kind of see people coming from all around the world
p364
aVand all these lines converging on the origin
p365
aVwhere the first rendition of the song was sung,
p366
aVand that's in Tokyo.
p367
aVAnd this is what it sounds like  when there's 1,000 people.
p368
aVThis is 1,000 voices.
p369
aa(lp370
V(Recording) \u266a Sometimes in our lives \u266a
p371
aa(lp372
V\u266a We all have pain, we all have sorrow \u266a
p373
aa(lp374
V\u266a But if we are wise \u266a
p375
aa(lp376
V\u266a We know that there's always tomorrow \u266a
p377
aa(lp378
V\u266a Lean on me \u266a
p379
aa(lp380
V\u266a When you're not strong \u266a
p381
aa(lp382
V\u266a And I'll be your friend \u266a
p383
aa(lp384
V\u266a I'll help you carry on \u266a
p385
aa(lp386
V\u266a For it won't be long \u266a
p387
aa(lp388
V\u266a Till I'm gonna need \u266a
p389
aa(lp390
V\u266a Somebody to lean on \u266a
p391
aa(lp392
V\u266a Just lean on \u2014 \u266a
p393
aa(lp394
VIs this computer music?
p395
aa(lp396
V(Applause)
p397
aa(lp398
VWas that computer music?
p399
aVYeah, I guess so; it's something that you really
p400
aVcouldn't have done without computers.
p401
aVBut at the same time, it's also just human,
p402
aVand I think what I've essentially answered so far
p403
aVis maybe why I do the stuff that I do,
p404
aVand let's just finally return to the first question:
p405
aVWhat is computer music?
p406
aVAnd I think that the catch here is that,
p407
aVat least to me, computer music
p408
aVisn't really about computers.
p409
aVIt is about people.
p410
aVIt's about how we can use technology
p411
aVto change the way we think
p412
aVand do and make music,
p413
aVand maybe even add to how we can
p414
aVconnect with each other through music.
p415
aa(lp416
VAnd with that, I want to say,
p417
aVthis is computer music, and thank you for listening.
