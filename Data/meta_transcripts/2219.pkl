V"Where are you from?" said the pale, tattooed man.
p4
aV"Where are you from?"
p5
aVIt's September 21, 2001,
p6
aV10 days after the worst attack on America since World War II.
p7
aVEveryone wonders about the next plane.
p8
aVPeople are looking for scapegoats.
p9
aVThe president,  the night before, pledges to
p10
aV"bring our enemies to justice  or bring justice to our enemies."
p11
aa(lp12
VAnd in the Dallas mini-mart,
p13
aVa Dallas mini-part surrounded by tire shops and strip joints
p14
aVa Bangladeshi immigrant  works the register.
p15
aVBack home, Raisuddin Bhuiyan was a big man, an Air Force officer.
p16
aVBut he dreamed of a  fresh start in America.
p17
aVIf he had to work briefly in a mini-mart to save up for I.T. classes
p18
aVand his wedding in two months, so be it.
p19
aa(lp20
VThen, on September 21,  that tattooed man enters the mart.
p21
aVHe holds a shotgun.
p22
aVRaisuddin knows the drill:
p23
aVputs cash on the counter.
p24
aVThis time, the man doesn't  touch the money.
p25
aV"Where are you from?" he asks.
p26
aV"Excuse me?" Raisuddin answers.
p27
aVHis accent betrays him.
p28
aVThe tattooed man, a self-styled true American vigilante,
p29
aVshoots Raisuddin in revenge for 9/11.
p30
aVRaisuddin feels millions of bees stinging his face.
p31
aVIn fact, dozens of scalding,  birdshot pellets puncture his head.
p32
aa(lp33
VBehind the counter, he lays in blood.
p34
aVHe cups a hand over his forehead to keep in the brains
p35
aVon which he'd gambled everything.
p36
aVHe recites verses from the Koran, begging his God to live.
p37
aVHe senses he is dying.
p38
aa(lp39
VHe didn't die.
p40
aVHis right eye left him.
p41
aVHis fiancée left him.
p42
aVHis landlord, the mini-mart owner, kicked him out.
p43
aVSoon he was homeless and  60,000 dollars in medical debt,
p44
aVincluding a fee for dialing  for an ambulance.
p45
aVBut Raisuddin lived.
p46
aa(lp47
VAnd years later, he would ask what he could do to repay his God
p48
aVand become worthy of this second chance.
p49
aVHe would come to believe, in fact,
p50
aVthat this chance called for him to give a second chance
p51
aVto a man we might think deserved no chance at all.
p52
aa(lp53
VTwelve years ago, I was a fresh graduate seeking my way in the world.
p54
aVBorn in Ohio to Indian immigrants,
p55
aVI settled on the ultimate rebellion  against my parents,
p56
aVmoving to the country they had worked so damn hard to get out of.
p57
aVWhat I thought might be a six-month stint in Mumbai stretched to six years.
p58
aVI became a writer and found myself amid a magical story:
p59
aVthe awakening of hope across much of the so-called Third World.
p60
aVSix years ago, I returned to America and realized something:
p61
aVThe American Dream was thriving,
p62
aVbut only in India.
p63
aVIn America, not so much.
p64
aa(lp65
VIn fact, I observed that  America was fracturing
p66
aVinto two distinct societies:
p67
aVa republic of dreams and a republic of fears.
p68
aVAnd then, I stumbled onto this  incredible tale of two lives
p69
aVand of these two Americas that brutally collided in that Dallas mini-mart.
p70
aVI knew at once I wanted to learn more,
p71
aVand eventually that I would write a book about them,
p72
aVfor their story was the story  of America's fracturing
p73
aVand of how it might be put back together.
p74
aa(lp75
VAfter he was shot, Raisuddin's life grew no easier.
p76
aVThe day after admitting him, the hospital discharged him.
p77
aVHis right eye couldn't see.
p78
aVHe couldn't speak.
p79
aVMetal peppered his face.
p80
aVBut he had no insurance,  so they bounced him.
p81
aVHis family in Bangladesh  begged him, "Come home."
p82
aVBut he told them he had  a dream to see about.
p83
aa(lp84
VHe found telemarketing work,
p85
aVthen he became an Olive Garden waiter,
p86
aVbecause where better to get over his fear of white people than the Olive Garden?
p87
aV(Laughter)
p88
aVNow, as a devout Muslim, he refused alcohol,
p89
aVdidn't touch the stuff.
p90
aVThen he learned that not selling it would slash his pay.
p91
aVSo he reasoned, like a budding  American pragmatist,
p92
aV"Well, God wouldn't want me to starve, would he?"
p93
aVAnd before long, in some months,  Raisuddin was that Olive Garden's
p94
aVhighest grossing alcohol pusher.
p95
aVHe found a man who taught him database administration.
p96
aVHe got part-time I.T. gigs.
p97
aVEventually, he landed a six-figure job at a blue chip tech company in Dallas.
p98
aa(lp99
VBut as America began to work for Raisuddin,
p100
aVhe avoided the classic error of the fortunate:
p101
aVassuming you're the rule,  not the exception.
p102
aVIn fact, he observed that many with the fortune of being born American
p103
aVwere nonetheless trapped in lives that  made second chances like his impossible.
p104
aVHe saw it at the Olive Garden itself,
p105
aVwhere so many of his colleagues had childhood horror stories
p106
aVof family dysfunction, chaos,  addiction, crime.
p107
aVHe'd heard a similar tale about the man who shot him
p108
aVback when he attended his trial.
p109
aVThe closer Raisuddin got to the America he had coveted from afar,
p110
aVthe more he realized there was another, equally real, America
p111
aVthat was stingier with second chances.
p112
aVThe man who shot Raisuddin grew up in that stingier America.
p113
aa(lp114
VFrom a distance, Mark Stroman was always the spark of parties,
p115
aValways making girls feel pretty.
p116
aVAlways working, no matter what  drugs or fights he'd had the night before.
p117
aVBut he'd always wrestled with demons.
p118
aVHe entered the world through the three gateways
p119
aVthat doom so many young American men:
p120
aVbad parents, bad schools, bad prisons.
p121
aVHis mother told him, regretfully, as a boy
p122
aVthat she'd been just 50 dollars  short of aborting him.
p123
aVSometimes, that little boy  would be at school,
p124
aVhe'd suddenly pull a knife  on his fellow classmates.
p125
aVSometimes that same little boy would be at his grandparents',
p126
aVtenderly feeding horses.
p127
aVHe was getting arrested before he shaved,
p128
aVfirst juvenile, then prison.
p129
aVHe became a casual white supremacist
p130
aVand, like so many around him,  a drug-addled and absent father.
p131
aVAnd then, before long, he found himself on death row,
p132
aVfor in his 2001 counter-jihad,  he had shot not one mini-mart clerk,
p133
aVbut three.
p134
aVOnly Raisuddin survived.
p135
aa(lp136
VStrangely, death row was  the first institution
p137
aVthat left Stroman better.
p138
aVHis old influences quit him.
p139
aVThe people entering his life  were virtuous and caring:
p140
aVpastors, journalists, European pen-pals.
p141
aVThey listened to him, prayed with him, helped him question himself.
p142
aVAnd sent him on a journey  of introspection and betterment.
p143
aVHe finally faced the hatred  that had defined his life.
p144
aVHe read Viktor Frankl,  the Holocaust survivor
p145
aVand regretted his swastika tattoos.
p146
aVHe found God.
p147
aVThen one day in 2011,  10 years after his crimes,
p148
aVStroman received news.
p149
aVOne of the men he'd shot, the survivor, was fighting to save his life.
p150
aa(lp151
VYou see, late in 2009, eight years after that shooting,
p152
aVRaisuddin had gone on his own journey, a pilgrimage to Mecca.
p153
aVAmid its crowds,  he felt immense gratitude,
p154
aVbut also duty.
p155
aVHe recalled promising God,  as he lay dying in 2001,
p156
aVthat if he lived, he would serve  humanity all his days.
p157
aVThen, he'd gotten busy  relaying the bricks of a life.
p158
aVNow it was time to pay his debts.
p159
aVAnd he decided, upon reflection, that his method of payment
p160
aVwould be an intervention  in the cycle of vengeance
p161
aVbetween the Muslim and Western worlds.
p162
aVAnd how would he intervene?
p163
aVBy forgiving Stroman publicly in the name of Islam
p164
aVand its doctrine of mercy.
p165
aVAnd then suing the state of Texas and its governor Rick Perry
p166
aVto prevent them from executing Stroman,
p167
aVexactly like most people  shot in the face do.
p168
aV(Laughter)
p169
aa(lp170
VYet Raisuddin's mercy was inspired  not only by faith.
p171
aVA newly minted American citizen, he had come to believe that Stroman
p172
aVwas the product of a hurting America that couldn't just be lethally injected away.
p173
aVThat insight is what moved me  to write my book "The True American."
p174
aVThis immigrant begging America  to be as merciful to a native son
p175
aVas it had been to an adopted one.
p176
aVIn the mini-mart, all those years earlier,
p177
aVnot just two men,  but two Americas collided.
p178
aVAn America that still dreams,  still strives,
p179
aVstill imagines that tomorrow can build on today,
p180
aVand an America that has resigned to fate,
p181
aVbuckled under stress and chaos, lowered expectations,
p182
aVan ducked into the oldest of refuges:
p183
aVthe tribal fellowship of one's own narrow kind.
p184
aVAnd it was Raisuddin, despite being a newcomer,
p185
aVdespite being attacked,
p186
aVdespite being homeless and traumatized,
p187
aVwho belonged to that republic of dreams
p188
aVand Stroman who belonged to that  other wounded country,
p189
aVdespite being born with the privilege of a native white man.
p190
aa(lp191
VI realized these men's stories formed an urgent parable about America.
p192
aVThe country I am so proud to call my own
p193
aVwasn't living through a  generalized decline
p194
aVas seen in Spain or Greece,  where prospects were dimming for everyone.
p195
aVAmerica is simultaneously the most and the least successful country
p196
aVin the industrialized world.
p197
aVLaunching the world's best companies,
p198
aVeven as record numbers  of children go hungry.
p199
aVSeeing life-expectancy drop for large groups,
p200
aVeven as it polishes  the world's best hospitals.
p201
aVAmerica today is a sprightly young body,
p202
aVhit by one of those strokes  that sucks the life from one side,
p203
aVwhile leaving the other worryingly perfect.
p204
aa(lp205
VOn July 20, 2011, right after  a sobbing Raisuddin
p206
aVtestified in defense of Stroman's life,
p207
aVStroman was killed by lethal injection by the state he so loved.
p208
aVHours earlier, when Raisuddin still thought he could still save Stroman,
p209
aVthe two men got to speak  for the second time ever.
p210
aVHere is an excerpt from their phone call.
p211
aVRaisuddin: "Mark, you should know  that I am praying for God,
p212
aVthe most compassionate and gracious.
p213
aVI forgive you and I do not hate you.
p214
aVI never hated you."
p215
aVStroman: "You are a remarkable person.
p216
aVThank you from my heart.
p217
aVI love you, bro."
p218
aa(lp219
VEven more amazingly, after the execution,
p220
aVRaisuddin reached out to Stroman's  eldest daughter, Amber,
p221
aVan ex-convinct and an addict.
p222
aVand offered his help.
p223
aV"You may have lost a father," he told her,
p224
aV"but you've gained an uncle."
p225
aVHe wanted her, too, to have  a second chance.
p226
aa(lp227
VIf human history were a parade,
p228
aVAmerica's float would be  a neon shrine to second chances.
p229
aVBut America, generous with second chances to the children of other lands,
p230
aVtoday grows miserly with first chances to the children of its own.
p231
aVAmerica still dazzles at allowing anybody to become an American.
p232
aVBut it is losing its luster at allowing every American to become a somebody.
p233
aa(lp234
VOver the last decade, seven million foreigners gained American citizenship.
p235
aVRemarkable.
p236
aVIn the meanwhile, how many Americans gained a place in the middle class?
p237
aVActually, the net influx was negative.
p238
aVGo back further,  and it's even more striking:
p239
aVSince the 60s, the middle class has shrunk by 20 percent,
p240
aVmainly because of the people tumbling out of it.
p241
aVAnd my reporting around the country tells me the problem is grimmer
p242
aVthan simple inequality.
p243
aVWhat I observe is a pair of secessions from the unifying center of American life.
p244
aVAn affluent secession of up, up and away,
p245
aVinto elite enclaves of the educated and into a global matrix
p246
aVof work, money and connections,
p247
aVand an impoverished secession  of down and out
p248
aVinto disconnected, dead-end lives
p249
aVthat the fortunate scarcely see.
p250
aa(lp251
VAnd don't console yourself  that you are the 99 percent.
p252
aVIf you live near a Whole Foods,
p253
aVif no one in your family serves  in the military,
p254
aVif you're paid by the year, not the hour,
p255
aVif most people you know finished college,
p256
aVif no one you know uses meth,
p257
aVif you married once and remain married,
p258
aVif you're not one of 65 million Americans with a criminal record \u2014
p259
aVif any or all of these things  describe you,
p260
aVthen accept the possibility that actually,
p261
aVyou may not know what's going on
p262
aVand you may be part of the problem.
p263
aa(lp264
VOther generations had to build  a fresh society after slavery,
p265
aVpull through a depression, defeat fascism,
p266
aVfreedom-ride in Mississippi.
p267
aVThe moral challenge of  my generation, I believe,
p268
aVis to reacquaint these two Americas,
p269
aVto choose union over secession once again.
p270
aVThis ins't a problem we can tax or tax-cut away.
p271
aVIt won't be solved by tweeting harder, building slicker apps,
p272
aVor starting one more  artisanal coffee roasting service.
p273
aVIt is a moral challenge that begs  each of us in the flourishing America
p274
aVto take on the wilting America as our own,
p275
aVas Raisuddin tried to do.
p276
aa(lp277
VLike him, we can make pilgrimages.
p278
aVAnd there, in Baltimore and Oregon  and Appalachia,
p279
aVfind new purpose, as he did.
p280
aVWe can immerse ourselves  in that other country,
p281
aVbear witness to its hopes and sorrows,
p282
aVand, like Raisuddin, ask what we can do.
p283
aVWhat can you do?
p284
aVWhat can you do?
p285
aVWhat can we do?
p286
aVHow might we build  a more merciful country?
p287
aa(lp288
VWe, the greatest inventors in the world,
p289
aVcan invent solutions to the problems  of that America, not only our own.
p290
aVWe, the writers and the journalists,  can cover that America's stories,
p291
aVinstead of shutting down  bureaus in its midst.
p292
aVWe can finance that America's ideas,
p293
aVinstead of ideas from New York  and San Francisco.
p294
aVWe can put our stethoscopes to its backs,
p295
aVteach there, go to court there, make there, live there, pray there.
p296
aa(lp297
VThis, I believe, is the calling  of a generation.
p298
aVAn America whose two halves learn again
p299
aVto stride, to plow, to forge, to dare together.
p300
aVA republic of chances, rewoven, renewed,
p301
aVbegins with us.
p302
aa(lp303
VThank you.
