VThis was in an area called Wellawatta, a prime residential area in Colombo.
p4
aVWe stood on the railroad tracks
p5
aVthat ran between my friend's house and the beach.
p6
aVThe tracks are elevated about eight feet from the waterline normally,
p7
aVbut at that point the water had receded
p8
aVto a level three or four feet below normal.
p9
aVI'd never seen the reef here before.
p10
aVThere were fish caught in rock pools left behind by the receding water.
p11
aVSome children jumped down and ran to the rock pools with bags.
p12
aVThey were trying to catch fish.
p13
aVNo one realized that this was a very bad idea.
p14
aVThe people on the tracks just continued to watch them.
p15
aVI turned around to check on my friend's house.
p16
aVThen someone on the tracks screamed.
p17
aVBefore I could turn around, everyone on the tracks was screaming and running.
p18
aa(lp19
VThe water had started coming back. It was foaming over the reef.
p20
aVThe children managed to run back onto the tracks.
p21
aVNo one was lost there. But the water continued to climb.
p22
aVIn about two minutes, it had reached the level of the railroad tracks
p23
aVand was coming over it. We had run about 100 meters by this time.
p24
aVIt continued to rise.
p25
aVI saw an old man standing at his gate, knee-deep in water, refusing to move.
p26
aVHe said he'd lived his whole life there by the beach,
p27
aVand that he would rather die there than run.
p28
aVA boy broke away from his mother to run back into his house
p29
aVto get his dog, who was apparently afraid.
p30
aVAn old lady, crying, was carried out of her house and up the road by her son.
p31
aVThe slum built on the railroad reservation
p32
aVbetween the sea and the railroad tracks was completely swept away.
p33
aVSince this was a high-risk location, the police had warned the residents,
p34
aVand no one was there when the water rose.
p35
aVBut they had not had any time to evacuate any belongings.
p36
aVFor hours afterwards, the sea was strewn with bits of wood for miles around \u2014
p37
aVall of this was from the houses in the slum.
p38
aVWhen the waters subsided, it was as if it had never existed.
p39
aa(lp40
VThis may seem hard to believe \u2014
p41
aVunless you've been reading lots and lots of news reports \u2014
p42
aVbut in many places, after the tsunami, villagers were still terrified.
p43
aVWhen what was a tranquil sea swallows up people, homes
p44
aVand long-tail boats \u2014 mercilessly, without warning \u2014
p45
aVand no one can tell you anything reliable about whether another one is coming,
p46
aVI'm not sure you'd want to calm down either.
p47
aVOne of the scariest things about the tsunami
p48
aVthat I've not seen mentioned is the complete lack of information.
p49
aVThis may seem minor, but it is terrifying to hear rumor after rumor
p50
aVafter rumor that another tidal wave, bigger than the last,
p51
aVwill be coming at exactly 1 p.m., or perhaps tonight, or perhaps ...
p52
aVYou don't even know if it is safe to go back down to the water,
p53
aVto catch a boat to the hospital.
p54
aVWe think that Phi Phi hospital was destroyed.
p55
aVWe think this boat is going to Phuket hospital,
p56
aVbut if it's too dangerous to land at its pier,
p57
aVthen perhaps it will go to Krabi instead, which is more protected.
p58
aVWe don't think another wave is coming right away.
p59
aa(lp60
VAt the Phi Phi Hill Resort,
p61
aVI was tucked into the corner furthest away from the television,
p62
aVbut I strained to listen for information.
p63
aVThey reported that there was an 8.5 magnitude earthquake in Sumatra,
p64
aVwhich triggered the massive tsunami.
p65
aVHaving this news was comforting in some small way
p66
aVto understand what had just happened to us.
p67
aVHowever, the report focused on what had already occurred
p68
aVand offered no information on what to expect now.
p69
aVIn general, everything was merely hearsay and rumor,
p70
aVand not a single person I spoke to for over 36 hours
p71
aVknew anything with any certainty.
p72
aVThose were two accounts of the Asian tsunami from two Internet blogs
p73
aVthat essentially sprang up after it occurred.
p74
aVI'm now going to show you two video segments from the tsunami
p75
aVthat also were shown on blogs.
p76
aVI should warn you, they're pretty powerful.
p77
aVOne from Thailand, and the second one from Phuket as well.
p78
aa(lp79
V(Screaming)
p80
aa(lp81
VVoice 1: It's coming in. It's coming again.
p82
aa(lp83
VVoice 2: It's coming again?
p84
aa(lp85
VVoice 1: Yeah. It's coming again.
p86
aa(lp87
VVoice 2: Come get inside here.
p88
aa(lp89
VVoice 1: It's coming again. Voice 2: New wave?
p90
aVVoice 1: It's coming again. New wave!
p91
aV[Unclear]
p92
aa(lp93
V(Screaming)
p94
aa(lp95
VThey called me out here.
p96
aa(lp97
VJames Surowiecki: Phew. Those were both on this site: waveofdestruction.org.
p98
aVIn the world of blogs, there's going to be before the tsunami and after the tsunami,
p99
aVbecause one of the things that happened in the wake of the tsunami was that,
p100
aValthough initially \u2014 that is, in that first day \u2014
p101
aVthere was actually a kind of dearth of live reporting, there was a dearth of live video
p102
aVand some people complained about this.
p103
aVThey said, "The blogsters let us down."
p104
aVWhat became very clear was that,
p105
aVwithin a few days, the outpouring of information was immense,
p106
aVand we got a complete and powerful picture of what had happened
p107
aVin a way that we never had been able to get before.
p108
aVAnd what you had was a group of essentially unorganized, unconnected
p109
aVwriters, video bloggers, etc., who were able to come up with
p110
aVa collective portrait of a disaster that gave us a much better sense
p111
aVof what it was like to actually be there than the mainstream media could give us.
p112
aa(lp113
VAnd so in some ways the tsunami can be seen as a sort of seminal moment,
p114
aVa moment in which the blogosphere came, to a certain degree, of age.
p115
aVNow, I'm going to move now from this kind of \u2014
p116
aVthe sublime in the traditional sense of the word,
p117
aVthat is to say, awe-inspiring, terrifying \u2014 to the somewhat more mundane.
p118
aVBecause when we think about blogs,
p119
aVI think for most of us who are concerned about them,
p120
aVwe're primarily concerned with things like politics, technology, etc.
p121
aVAnd I want to ask three questions in this talk,
p122
aVin the 10 minutes that remain, about the blogosphere.
p123
aVThe first one is, What does it tell us about our ideas,
p124
aVabout what motivates people to do things?
p125
aVThe second is, Do blogs genuinely have the possibility
p126
aVof accessing a kind of collective intelligence
p127
aVthat has previously remained, for the most part, untapped?
p128
aVAnd then the third part is, What are the potential problems,
p129
aVor the dark side of blogs as we know them?
p130
aa(lp131
VOK, the first question:
p132
aVWhat do they tell us about why people do things?
p133
aVOne of the fascinating things about the blogosphere specifically,
p134
aVand, of course, the Internet more generally \u2014
p135
aVand it's going to seem like a very obvious point,
p136
aVbut I think it is an important one to think about \u2014
p137
aVis that the people who are generating these enormous reams of content
p138
aVevery day, who are spending enormous amounts of time organizing,
p139
aVlinking, commenting on the substance of the Internet,
p140
aVare doing so primarily for free.
p141
aVThey are not getting paid for it in any way other than in the attention and,
p142
aVto some extent, the reputational capital that they gain from doing a good job.
p143
aVAnd this is \u2014 at least, to a traditional economist \u2014 somewhat remarkable,
p144
aVbecause the traditional account of economic man would say that,
p145
aVbasically, you do things for a concrete reward, primarily financial.
p146
aVBut instead, what we're finding on the Internet \u2014
p147
aVand one of the great geniuses of it \u2014 is that people have found a way
p148
aVto work together without any money involved at all.
p149
aVThey have come up with, in a sense, a different method for organizing activity.
p150
aa(lp151
VThe Yale Law professor Yochai Benkler, in an essay called "Coase's Penguin,"
p152
aVtalks about this open-source model, which we're familiar with from Linux,
p153
aVas being potentially applicable in a whole host of situations.
p154
aVAnd, you know, if you think about this with the tsunami,
p155
aVwhat you have is essentially a kind of an army of local journalists,
p156
aVwho are producing enormous amounts of material
p157
aVfor no reason other than to tell their stories.
p158
aVThat's a very powerful idea, and it's a very powerful reality.
p159
aVAnd it's one that offers really interesting possibilities
p160
aVfor organizing a whole host of activities down the road.
p161
aa(lp162
VSo, I think the first thing that the blogosphere tells us
p163
aVis that we need to expand our idea of what counts as rational,
p164
aVand we need to expand our simple equation of value equals money,
p165
aVor, you have to pay for it to be good,
p166
aVbut that in fact you can end up with collectively really brilliant products
p167
aVwithout any money at all changing hands.
p168
aVThere are a few bloggers \u2014 somewhere maybe around 20, now \u2014
p169
aVwho do, in fact, make some kind of money, and a few
p170
aVwho are actually trying to make a full-time living out of it,
p171
aVbut the vast majority of them are doing it because they love it
p172
aVor they love the attention, or whatever it is.
p173
aVSo, Howard Rheingold has written a lot about this
p174
aVand, I think, is writing about this more,
p175
aVbut this notion of voluntary cooperation
p176
aVis an incredibly powerful one, and one worth thinking about.
p177
aa(lp178
VThe second question is, What does the blogosphere actually do for us,
p179
aVin terms of accessing collective intelligence?
p180
aVYou know, as Chris mentioned, I wrote a book called "The Wisdom of Crowds."
p181
aVAnd the premise of "The Wisdom of Crowds" is that,
p182
aVunder the right conditions, groups can be remarkably intelligent.
p183
aVAnd they can actually often be smarter
p184
aVthan even the smartest person within them.
p185
aVThe simplest example of this is if you ask a group of people
p186
aVto do something like guess how many jellybeans are in a jar.
p187
aVIf I had a jar of jellybeans
p188
aVand I asked you all to guess how many jellybeans were in that jar,
p189
aVyour average guess would be remarkably good.
p190
aVIt would be somewhere probably within three and five percent
p191
aVof the number of beans in the jar,
p192
aVand it would be better than 90 to 95 percent of you.
p193
aVThere may be one or two of you who are brilliant jelly bean guessers,
p194
aVbut for the most part the group's guess
p195
aVwould be better than just about all of you.
p196
aVAnd what's fascinating is that you can see this phenomenon at work
p197
aVin many more complicated situations.
p198
aa(lp199
VFor instance, if you look at the odds on horses at a racetrack,
p200
aVthey predict almost perfectly how likely a horse is to win.
p201
aVIn a sense, the group of betters at the racetrack
p202
aVis forecasting the future, in probabilistic terms.
p203
aVYou know, if you think about something like Google,
p204
aVwhich essentially is relying on the collective intelligence of the Web
p205
aVto seek out those sites that have the most valuable information \u2014
p206
aVwe know that Google does an exceptionally good job of doing that,
p207
aVand it does that because, collectively, this disorganized thing
p208
aVwe call the "World Wide Web" actually has a remarkable order,
p209
aVor a remarkable intelligence in it.
p210
aVAnd this, I think, is one of the real promises of the blogosphere.
p211
aa(lp212
VDan Gillmor \u2014 whose book "We the Media"
p213
aVis included in the gift pack \u2014
p214
aVhas talked about it as saying that, as a writer,
p215
aVhe's recognized that his readers know more than he does.
p216
aVAnd this is a very challenging idea. It's a very challenging idea
p217
aVto mainstream media. It's a very challenging idea to anyone
p218
aVwho has invested an enormous amount of time and expertise,
p219
aVand who has a lot of energy invested in the notion
p220
aVthat he or she knows better than everyone else.
p221
aVBut what the blogosphere offers is the possibility
p222
aVof getting at the kind of collective, distributive intelligence that is out there,
p223
aVand that we know is available to us
p224
aVif we can just figure out a way of accessing it.
p225
aVEach blog post, each blog commentary
p226
aVmay not, in and of itself, be exactly what we're looking for,
p227
aVbut collectively the judgment of those people posting, those people linking,
p228
aVmore often than not is going to give you a very interesting
p229
aVand enormously valuable picture of what's going on.
p230
aVSo, that's the positive side of it.
p231
aVThat's the positive side of what is sometimes called
p232
aVparticipatory journalism or citizen journalism, etc. \u2014
p233
aVthat, in fact, we are giving people
p234
aVwho have never been able to talk before a voice,
p235
aVand we're able to access information that has always been there
p236
aVbut has essentially gone untapped.
p237
aa(lp238
VBut there is a dark side to this,
p239
aVand that's what I want to spend the last part of my talk on.
p240
aVOne of the things that happens if you spend a lot of time on the Internet,
p241
aVand you spend a lot of time thinking about the Internet,
p242
aVis that it is very easy to fall in love with the Internet.
p243
aVIt is very easy to fall in love with the decentralized,
p244
aVbottom-up structure of the Internet.
p245
aVIt is very easy to think that networks are necessarily good things \u2014
p246
aVthat being linked from one place to another,
p247
aVthat being tightly linked in a group, is a very good thing.
p248
aVAnd much of the time it is.
p249
aVBut there's also a downside to this \u2014 a kind of dark side, in fact \u2014
p250
aVand that is that the more tightly linked we've become to each other,
p251
aVthe harder it is for each of us to remain independent.
p252
aa(lp253
VOne of the fundamental characteristics of a network is that,
p254
aVonce you are linked in the network,
p255
aVthe network starts to shape your views
p256
aVand starts to shape your interactions with everybody else.
p257
aVThat's one of the things that defines what a network is.
p258
aVA network is not just the product of its component parts.
p259
aVIt is something more than that.
p260
aVIt is, as Steven Johnson has talked about, an emergent phenomenon.
p261
aVNow, this has all these benefits:
p262
aVit's very beneficial in terms of the efficiency of communicating information;
p263
aVit gives you access to a whole host of people;
p264
aVit allows people to coordinate their activities in very good ways.
p265
aVBut the problem is that groups are only smart
p266
aVwhen the people in them are as independent as possible.
p267
aVThis is the paradox of the wisdom of crowds,
p268
aVor the paradox of collective intelligence,
p269
aVthat what it requires is actually a form of independent thinking.
p270
aVAnd networks make it harder for people to do that,
p271
aVbecause they drive attention to the things that the network values.
p272
aa(lp273
VSo, one of the phenomena that's very clear in the blogosphere
p274
aVis that once a meme, once an idea gets going,
p275
aVit is very easy for people to just sort of pile on,
p276
aVbecause other people have, say, a link.
p277
aVPeople have linked to it, and so other people in turn link to it, etc., etc.
p278
aVAnd that phenomenon
p279
aVof piling on the existing links
p280
aVis one that is characteristic of the blogosphere,
p281
aVparticularly of the political blogosphere,
p282
aVand it is one that essentially throws off
p283
aVthis beautiful, decentralized, bottom-up intelligence
p284
aVthat blogs can manifest in the right conditions.
p285
aa(lp286
VThe metaphor that I like to use is the metaphor of the circular mill.
p287
aVA lot of people talk about ants.
p288
aVYou know, this is a conference inspired by nature.
p289
aVWhen we talk about bottom-up, decentralized phenomena,
p290
aVthe ant colony is the classic metaphor, because,
p291
aVno individual ant knows what it's doing,
p292
aVbut collectively ants are able to reach incredibly intelligent decisions.
p293
aVThey're able to reach food as efficiently as possible,
p294
aVthey're able to guide their traffic with remarkable speed.
p295
aVSo, the ant colony is a great model:
p296
aVyou have all these little parts that collectively add up to a great thing.
p297
aVBut we know that occasionally ants go astray,
p298
aVand what happens is that, if army ants are wandering around and they get lost,
p299
aVthey start to follow a simple rule \u2014
p300
aVjust do what the ant in front of you does.
p301
aVAnd what happens is that the ants eventually end up in a circle.
p302
aVAnd there's this famous example of one that was 1,200 feet long
p303
aVand lasted for two days, and the ants just kept marching around and around
p304
aVin a circle until they died.
p305
aVAnd that, I think, is a sort of thing to watch out for.
p306
aVThat's the thing we have to fear \u2014
p307
aVis that we're just going to keep marching around and around until we die.
p308
aa(lp309
VNow, I want to connect this back, though, to the tsunami,
p310
aVbecause one of the great things about the tsunami \u2014
p311
aVin terms of the blogosphere's coverage,
p312
aVnot in terms of the tsunami itself \u2014
p313
aVis that it really did represent a genuine bottom-up phenomenon.
p314
aVYou saw sites that had never existed before getting huge amounts of traffic.
p315
aVYou saw people being able to offer up their independent points of view
p316
aVin a way that they hadn't before.
p317
aVThere, you really did see the intelligence of the Web manifest itself.
p318
aVSo, that's the upside. The circular mill is the downside.
p319
aVAnd I think that the former is what we really need to strive for.
