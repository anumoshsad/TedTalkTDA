VGood afternoon, I'm proud to be here at TEDxKrakow.
p4
aVI'll try to speak a little bit today about a phenomenon
p5
aVwhich can, and actually is changing the world,
p6
aVand whose name is people power.
p7
aVI'll start with an anecdote,
p8
aVor for those of you who are Monty Python lovers,
p9
aVa Monty Python type of sketch.
p10
aVHere it is.
p11
aa(lp12
VIt is December 15, 2010.
p13
aVSomebody gives you a bet: you will look at a crystal ball,
p14
aVand you will see the future; the future will be accurate.
p15
aVBut you need to share it with the world.
p16
aVOK, curiosity killed the cat, you take the bet,
p17
aVyou look at the crystal ball.
p18
aVOne hour later, you're sitting in a building of the national TV,
p19
aVin a top show, and you tell the story.
p20
aVBefore the end of 2011,
p21
aVBen Ali, and Mubarak, and Gaddafi would be down,
p22
aVand prosecuted.
p23
aVSaleh of Yemen and Assad of Syria
p24
aVwould be either challenged, or already on their knees.
p25
aVOsama bin Laden would be dead,
p26
aVand Ratko Mladic would be in the Hague.
p27
aa(lp28
VNow, the anchor watches you with a strange gaze on his face.
p29
aVAnd then, on top of it you add:
p30
aV"And thousands of young people from Athens, Madrid and New York
p31
aVwill demonstrate for social justice, claiming they are inspired by Arabs."
p32
aa(lp33
VNext thing you know, two guys in white appear,
p34
aVthey give you the strange t-shirt,
p35
aVtake you to the nearest mental institution.
p36
aVSo I would like to speak a little bit
p37
aVabout the phenomenon which is behind what already seems to be
p38
aVa very bad year for bad guys.
p39
aVAnd this phenomenon is called people power.
p40
aa(lp41
VWell, people power has been there for a while.
p42
aVIt helped Gandhi kick the Brits from India,
p43
aVit helped Martin Luther King win his historic racial struggle.
p44
aVIt helped a local, Lech Walesa,
p45
aVto kick out one million Soviet troops from Poland,
p46
aVand in beginning the end of the Soviet Union as we know it.
p47
aa(lp48
VSo what's new in it?
p49
aVWhat seems to be very new,
p50
aVwhich is the idea I would like to share with you today,
p51
aVis that there is a set of rules and skills
p52
aVwhich can be learned and taught
p53
aVin order to perform successful nonviolent struggle.
p54
aVIf this is true, we can help these movements.
p55
aa(lp56
VWell, the first one - analytic skills.
p57
aVI'll try where it all started in the Middle East.
p58
aVAnd for so many years,
p59
aVwe were living with a completely wrong perception of the Middle East.
p60
aVIt was looking like the frozen region.
p61
aVLiterally a refrigerator.
p62
aVAnd there were only two types of meal there.
p63
aVSteak, which stands for a Mubarak-Ben Ali type of military police dictatorship,
p64
aVor a potato, which stands for a Tehran type of theocracies.
p65
aVAnd everybody was amazed when the refrigerator opened,
p66
aVand millions of young, mainly secular people
p67
aVstepped out to do the change.
p68
aVGuess what - they didn't watch the demographics.
p69
aVWhat is the average age of an Egyptian? 24.
p70
aVHow long was Mubarak in power? 31.
p71
aVSo, this system was just obsolete, they expired.
p72
aVAnd young people of the Arab world have awakened one morning,
p73
aVand understood that power lies in their hands.
p74
aVThe rest is the year in front of us.
p75
aVAnd guess what? The same Generation Y,
p76
aVwith their rules, with their tools, with their games,
p77
aVand with their language, which sounds a little bit strange to me.
p78
aVI'm 38 now.
p79
aVAnd can you look at the age of the people on the streets of Europe?
p80
aVIt seems that Generation Y is coming.
p81
aa(lp82
VNow, let me set another example.
p83
aVI'm meeting different people throughout the world,
p84
aVand they are, you know, academics, and professors, and doctors,
p85
aVand they will always talk conditions.
p86
aVThey will say: "People power will work only if the regime is not too oppressive."
p87
aVThey will say: "People power will work,
p88
aVif the annual income of the country is between X and Z."
p89
aVThey will say: "People power will work only if there is a foreign pressure."
p90
aVThey will say: "People power will work only if there is no oil."
p91
aVAnd, I mean, there is a set of conditions.
p92
aVWell, the news here is that your skills during the conflict
p93
aVseem to be more important than the conditions.
p94
aVNamely, the skills of unity, planning, and maintaining nonviolent discipline.
p95
aa(lp96
VLet me give you an example.
p97
aVI come from a country called Serbia.
p98
aVIt took us 10 years to unite 18 opposition party leaders,
p99
aVwith their big egos, behind one single candidate
p100
aVagainst the Balkan dictator Slobodan Milosevic.
p101
aVGuess what? That was the day of his defeat.
p102
aVYou look at the Egyptians, they fight on Tahrir Square,
p103
aVthey get rid of their individual symbols,
p104
aVthey appear on the street only with the flag of Egypt.
p105
aVI will give you a counter-example.
p106
aVYou see nine presidential candidates running against Lukashenko,
p107
aVyou all know the outcome.
p108
aVSo unity is a big thing.
p109
aVAnd this can be achieved.
p110
aVSame with planning.
p111
aVSomebody has lied to you
p112
aVabout the successful and spontaneous nonviolent revolution.
p113
aVThat thing doesn't exist in the world.
p114
aVWhenever you see young people in front of the row
p115
aVtrying to fraternize with the police or military,
p116
aVsomebody was thinking about it before.
p117
aa(lp118
VNow, at the end, nonviolent discipline.
p119
aVAnd this is probably the game-changer.
p120
aVIf you maintain nonviolent discipline,
p121
aVyou'll exclusively win.
p122
aVYou have 100,000 people in a nonviolent march,
p123
aVone idiot or agent-provocateur throwing a stone.
p124
aVGuess what takes all the cameras.
p125
aVThat one guy.
p126
aVOne single act of violence can literally destroy your movement.
p127
aa(lp128
VNow, let me move to another place.
p129
aVIt's the selection of strategies and tactics.
p130
aVThere are certain rules in nonviolent struggle you may follow.
p131
aVFirst, you start small.
p132
aVSecond, you pick the battles you can win.
p133
aVIt's only 200 of us in this room.
p134
aVWe won't call for the march of a million.
p135
aVBut what if we organized the spraying of graffiti throughout the night,
p136
aVall over Krakow.
p137
aVThe city will know.
p138
aVSo, we pick tactics accommodated to the event,
p139
aVespecially this thing we call the small tactics of dispersion.
p140
aVThey're very useful in violent oppression.
p141
aVWe are actually witnessing the picture of one of the best tactics ever used.
p142
aVIt was on Tahrir square,
p143
aVwhere the international community was constantly frightened
p144
aVthat, you know, the Islamists will overtake the revolution.
p145
aVWhat they organized \u2014
p146
aVChristians protecting Muslims where they are praying,
p147
aVa Coptic wedding cheered by thousands of Muslims,
p148
aVthe world has just changed the picture,
p149
aVbut somebody was thinking about this previously.
p150
aVSo there are so many things you can do
p151
aVinstead of getting into one place,
p152
aVshouting, and you know, showing off in front of the security forces.
p153
aa(lp154
VNow, there is also another very important dynamic.
p155
aVAnd this is a dynamic that analysts normally don't see.
p156
aVThis is the dynamic between fear and apathy on the one side,
p157
aVand enthusiasm and humor on another side.
p158
aVSo, it works like in a video game.
p159
aVYou have the fear high, you have status quo.
p160
aVYou have the enthusiasm higher,
p161
aVyou see the fear is starting to melt.
p162
aVDay two, you see people running towards the police
p163
aVinstead of from the police, in Egypt.
p164
aVYou can tell that something is happening there.
p165
aa(lp166
VAnd then, it's about the humor.
p167
aVHumor is such a powerful game-changer,
p168
aVand of course, it was very big in Poland.
p169
aVYou know, we were just a small group of crazy students in Serbia
p170
aVwhen we made this big skit.
p171
aVWe put the big petrol barrel
p172
aVwith a portrait of Mr. President on it, in the middle of the Main Street.
p173
aVThere was a hole in the top.
p174
aVSo you could literally come, put a coin in,
p175
aVget a baseball bat, and hit his face.
p176
aVSounds loud.
p177
aVAnd within minutes,
p178
aVwe were sitting in a nearby café having coffee,
p179
aVand there was a queue of people waiting to do this lovely thing.
p180
aVWell, that's just the beginning of the show.
p181
aVThe real show starts when the police appears.
p182
aa(lp183
V(Laughter)
p184
aa(lp185
V"What will they do?"
p186
aVArrest us? We were nowhere to be seen.
p187
aVWe were like three blocks away, observing it from our espresso bar.
p188
aVArrest the shoppers, with kids?
p189
aVDoesn't make sense.
p190
aVOf course, you could bet, they did the most stupid thing.
p191
aVThey arrested the barrel.
p192
aVAnd now, the picture of the smashed face on the barrel,
p193
aVwith the policemen dragging it to the police car,
p194
aVthat was the best day for newspaper photographers
p195
aVthat they will ever have.
p196
aa(lp197
VSo, I mean, these are the things you can do.
p198
aVAnd you can always use humor.
p199
aVThere is also one big thing about humor,
p200
aVit really hurts.
p201
aVBecause these guys really are taking themselves too seriously.
p202
aVWhen you start to mock them, it hurts.
p203
aa(lp204
VNow, everybody is talking about His Majesty, the Internet,
p205
aVand it is also a very useful skill.
p206
aVBut don't rush to label things like "a Facebook Revolution,"
p207
aV"Twitter Revolution."
p208
aVDon't mix the tools with the substance.
p209
aVIt is true that the Internet and the new media are very useful
p210
aVin making things faster and cheaper.
p211
aVThey also make it a bit safer for the participants,
p212
aVbecause they give partial anonymity.
p213
aa(lp214
VWe're watching the great example of something else the Internet can do.
p215
aVIt can put the price tag of state-sponsored violence
p216
aVover a nonviolent protester.
p217
aVThis is the famous group "We are all Khaled Said,"
p218
aVmade by Wael Ghonim in Egypt, and his friend.
p219
aVThis is the mutilated face of the guy who was beaten by the police.
p220
aVThis is how he became known to the public,
p221
aVand this is what probably became the straw that broke the camel's back.
p222
aa(lp223
VBut here is also the bad news.
p224
aVThe nonviolent struggle is won in the real world, in the streets.
p225
aVYou will never change your society towards democracy,
p226
aVor, you know, the economy, if you sit down and click.
p227
aVThere are risks to be taken,
p228
aVand there are living people who are winning the struggle.
p229
aa(lp230
VWell, the million-dollar question.
p231
aVWhat will happen in the Arab world?
p232
aVAnd though young people from the Arab world
p233
aVwere pretty successful in bringing down three dictators,
p234
aVshaking the region,
p235
aVkind of persuading the clever kings from Jordan and Morocco
p236
aVto do substantial reforms,
p237
aVit is yet to be seen what will be the outcome.
p238
aVWhether the Egyptians and Tunisians will make it through the transition,
p239
aVor this will end in bloody ethnic and religious conflicts,
p240
aVwhether the Syrians will maintain nonviolent discipline,
p241
aVfaced with a brutal daily violence which kills thousands already,
p242
aVor they will slip into violent struggle
p243
aVand make ugly civil war.
p244
aVWill these revolutions be pushed through the transitions and democracy
p245
aVor be overtaken by the military or extremists of all kinds?
p246
aVWe cannot tell.
p247
aVThe same works for the Western sector,
p248
aVwhere you can see all these excited young people
p249
aVprotesting around the world, occupying this, occupying that.
p250
aVAre they going to become the world wave?
p251
aVAre they going to find their skills, their enthusiasm, and their strategy
p252
aVto find what they really want and push for the reform,
p253
aVor will they just stay complaining about the endless list
p254
aVof the things they hate?
p255
aVThis is the difference between the two paths.
p256
aa(lp257
VNow, what do the statistics have?
p258
aVMy friend Maria Stephan's book
p259
aVtalks a lot about violent and nonviolent struggle,
p260
aVand there are some shocking data.
p261
aVIf you look at the last 35 years and different social transitions,
p262
aVfrom dictatorship to democracy,
p263
aVyou will see that, out of 67 different cases,
p264
aVin 50 of these cases it was nonviolent struggle
p265
aVwhich was the key power.
p266
aVThis is one more reason to look at this phenomenon,
p267
aVthis is one more reason to look at Generation Y.
p268
aVEnough for me to give them credit,
p269
aVand hope that they will find their skills and their courage
p270
aVto use nonviolent struggle
p271
aVand thus fix at least a part of the mess our generation is making in this world.
p272
aa(lp273
VThank you.
