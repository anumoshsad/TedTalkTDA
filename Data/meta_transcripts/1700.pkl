VI'm here to show you
p4
aVhow something you can't see can be so much fun to look at.
p5
aVYou're about to experience a new, available
p6
aVand exciting technology that's going to make us rethink
p7
aVhow we waterproof our lives.
p8
aa(lp9
VWhat I have here is a cinder block
p10
aVthat we've coated half with a nanotechnology spray
p11
aVthat can be applied to almost any material.
p12
aVIt's called Ultra-Ever Dry,
p13
aVand when you apply it to any material,
p14
aVit turns into a superhydrophobic shield.
p15
aVSo this is a cinder block, uncoated,
p16
aVand you can see that it's porous, it absorbs water.
p17
aVNot anymore.
p18
aVPorous, nonporous.
p19
aa(lp20
VSo what's superhydrophobic?
p21
aVSuperhydrophobic is how we measure
p22
aVa drop of water on a surface.
p23
aVThe rounder it is, the more hydrophobic it is,
p24
aVand if it's really round, it's superhydrophobic.
p25
aVA freshly waxed car, the water molecules slump
p26
aVto about 90 degrees.
p27
aVA windshield coating is going to give you about 110 degrees.
p28
aVBut what you're seeing here is 160 to 175 degrees,
p29
aVand anything over 150 is superhydrophobic.
p30
aVSo as part of the demonstration,
p31
aVwhat I have is a pair of gloves,
p32
aVand we've coated one of the gloves
p33
aVwith the nanotechnology coating,
p34
aVand let's see if you can tell which one,
p35
aVand I'll give you a hint.
p36
aa(lp37
VDid you guess the one that was dry?
p38
aa(lp39
VWhen you have nanotechnology and nanoscience,
p40
aVwhat's occurred is that we're able to now
p41
aVlook at atoms and molecules and actually control them
p42
aVfor great benefits.
p43
aVAnd we're talking really small here.
p44
aVThe way you measure nanotechnology is in nanometers,
p45
aVand one nanometer is a billionth of a meter,
p46
aVand to put some scale to that,
p47
aVif you had a nanoparticle that was one nanometer thick,
p48
aVand you put it side by side, and you had 50,000 of them,
p49
aVyou'd be the width of a human hair.
p50
aVSo very small, but very useful.
p51
aa(lp52
VAnd it's not just water that this works with.
p53
aVIt's a lot of water-based materials like concrete,
p54
aVwater-based paint,
p55
aVmud,
p56
aVand also some refined oils as well.
p57
aa(lp58
VYou can see the difference.
p59
aa(lp60
VMoving onto the next demonstration,
p61
aVwe've taken a pane of glass and we've coated the outside of it,
p62
aVwe've framed it with the nanotechnology coating,
p63
aVand we're going to pour this green-tinted water inside the middle,
p64
aVand you're going to see, it's going to spread out on glass
p65
aVlike you'd normally think it would,
p66
aVexcept when it hits the coating, it stops,
p67
aVand I can't even coax it to leave.
p68
aVIt's that afraid of the water.
p69
aa(lp70
V(Applause)
p71
aa(lp72
VSo what's going on here? What's happening?
p73
aVWell, the surface of the spray coating
p74
aVis actually filled with nanoparticles
p75
aVthat form a very rough and craggly surface.
p76
aVYou'd think it'd be smooth, but it's actually not.
p77
aVAnd it has billions of interstitial spaces,
p78
aVand those spaces, along with the nanoparticles,
p79
aVreach up and grab the air molecules,
p80
aVand cover the surface with air.
p81
aVIt's an umbrella of air all across it,
p82
aVand that layer of air is what the water hits,
p83
aVthe mud hits, the concrete hits, and it glides right off.
p84
aVSo if I put this inside this water here,
p85
aVyou can see a silver reflective coating around it,
p86
aVand that silver reflective coating
p87
aVis the layer of air that's protecting the water
p88
aVfrom touching the paddle, and it's dry.
p89
aa(lp90
VSo what are the applications?
p91
aVI mean, many of you right now are probably going through your head.
p92
aVEveryone that sees this gets excited, and says,
p93
aV"Oh, I could use it for this and this and this."
p94
aVThe applications in a general sense
p95
aVcould be anything that's anti-wetting.
p96
aVWe've certainly seen that today.
p97
aVIt could be anything that's anti-icing,
p98
aVbecause if you don't have water, you don't have ice.
p99
aVIt could be anti-corrosion.
p100
aVNo water, no corrosion.
p101
aVIt could be anti-bacterial.
p102
aVWithout water, the bacteria won't survive.
p103
aVAnd it could be things that need to be self-cleaning as well.
p104
aa(lp105
VSo imagine how something like this
p106
aVcould help revolutionize your field of work.
p107
aVAnd I'm going to leave you with one last demonstration,
p108
aVbut before I do that, I would like to say thank you,
p109
aVand think small.
p110
aV(Applause)
p111
aVIt's going to happen. Wait for it. Wait for it.

VHe ran into all sorts of problems in terms of managing the medical research part.
p118
aVIt's happening!
