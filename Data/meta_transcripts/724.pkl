VI'd like to talk to you today about the human brain,
p4
aVwhich is what we do research on at the University of California.
p5
aVJust think about this problem for a second.
p6
aVHere is a lump of flesh, about three pounds,
p7
aVwhich you can hold in the palm of your hand.
p8
aVBut it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space.
p9
aVIt can contemplate the meaning of infinity,
p10
aVask questions about the meaning of its own existence,
p11
aVabout the nature of God.
p12
aa(lp13
VAnd this is truly the most amazing thing in the world.
p14
aVIt's the greatest mystery confronting human beings:
p15
aVHow does this all come about?
p16
aVWell, the brain, as you know, is made up of neurons.
p17
aVWe're looking at neurons here.
p18
aVThere are 100 billion neurons in the adult human brain.
p19
aVAnd each neuron makes something like 1,000 to 10,000 contacts
p20
aVwith other neurons in the brain.
p21
aVAnd based on this, people have calculated
p22
aVthat the number of permutations and combinations of brain activity
p23
aVexceeds the number of elementary particles in the universe.
p24
aa(lp25
VSo, how do you go about studying the brain?
p26
aVOne approach is to look at patients who had lesions
p27
aVin different part of the brain, and study changes in their behavior.
p28
aVThis is what I spoke about in the last TED.
p29
aVToday I'll talk about a different approach,
p30
aVwhich is to put electrodes in different parts of the brain,
p31
aVand actually record the activity of individual nerve cells in the brain.
p32
aVSort of eavesdrop on the activity of nerve cells in the brain.
p33
aa(lp34
VNow, one recent discovery that has been made
p35
aVby researchers in Italy, in Parma,
p36
aVby Giacomo Rizzolatti and his colleagues,
p37
aVis a group of neurons called mirror neurons,
p38
aVwhich are on the front of the brain in the frontal lobes.
p39
aVNow, it turns out there are neurons
p40
aVwhich are called ordinary motor command neurons in the front of the brain,
p41
aVwhich have been known for over 50 years.
p42
aVThese neurons will fire when a person performs a specific action.
p43
aVFor example, if I do that, and reach and grab an apple,
p44
aVa motor command neuron in the front of my brain will fire.
p45
aVIf I reach out and pull an object, another neuron will fire,
p46
aVcommanding me to pull that object.
p47
aVThese are called motor command neurons that have been known for a long time.
p48
aa(lp49
VBut what Rizzolatti found was
p50
aVa subset of these neurons,
p51
aVmaybe about 20 percent of them, will also fire
p52
aVwhen I'm looking at somebody else performing the same action.
p53
aVSo, here is a neuron that fires when I reach and grab something,
p54
aVbut it also fires when I watch Joe reaching and grabbing something.
p55
aVAnd this is truly astonishing.
p56
aVBecause it's as though this neuron is adopting
p57
aVthe other person's point of view.
p58
aVIt's almost as though it's performing a virtual reality simulation
p59
aVof the other person's action.
p60
aa(lp61
VNow, what is the significance of these mirror neurons?
p62
aVFor one thing they must be involved in things like imitation and emulation.
p63
aVBecause to imitate a complex act
p64
aVrequires my brain to adopt the other person's point of view.
p65
aVSo, this is important for imitation and emulation.
p66
aVWell, why is that important?
p67
aVWell, let's take a look at the next slide.
p68
aVSo, how do you do imitation? Why is imitation important?
p69
aVMirror neurons and imitation, emulation.
p70
aa(lp71
VNow, let's look at culture, the phenomenon of human culture.
p72
aVIf you go back in time about [75,000] to 100,000 years ago,
p73
aVlet's look at human evolution, it turns out
p74
aVthat something very important happened around 75,000 years ago.
p75
aVAnd that is, there is a sudden emergence and rapid spread
p76
aVof a number of skills that are unique to human beings
p77
aVlike tool use,
p78
aVthe use of fire, the use of shelters, and, of course, language,
p79
aVand the ability to read somebody else's mind
p80
aVand interpret that person's behavior.
p81
aVAll of that happened relatively quickly.
p82
aa(lp83
VEven though the human brain had achieved its present size
p84
aValmost three or four hundred thousand years ago,
p85
aV100,000 years ago all of this happened very, very quickly.
p86
aVAnd I claim that what happened was
p87
aVthe sudden emergence of a sophisticated mirror neuron system,
p88
aVwhich allowed you to emulate and imitate other people's actions.
p89
aVSo that when there was a sudden accidental discovery
p90
aVby one member of the group, say the use of fire,
p91
aVor a particular type of tool, instead of dying out,
p92
aVthis spread rapidly, horizontally across the population,
p93
aVor was transmitted vertically, down the generations.
p94
aa(lp95
VSo, this made evolution suddenly Lamarckian,
p96
aVinstead of Darwinian.
p97
aVDarwinian evolution is slow; it takes hundreds of thousands of years.
p98
aVA polar bear, to evolve a coat,
p99
aVwill take thousands of generations, maybe 100,000 years.
p100
aVA human being, a child, can just watch its parent
p101
aVkill another polar bear,
p102
aVand skin it and put the skin on its body, fur on the body,
p103
aVand learn it in one step. What the polar bear
p104
aVtook 100,000 years to learn,
p105
aVit can learn in five minutes, maybe 10 minutes.
p106
aVAnd then once it's learned this it spreads
p107
aVin geometric proportion across a population.
p108
aa(lp109
VThis is the basis. The imitation of complex skills
p110
aVis what we call culture and is the basis of civilization.
p111
aVNow there is another kind of mirror neuron,
p112
aVwhich is involved in something quite different.
p113
aVAnd that is, there are mirror neurons,
p114
aVjust as there are mirror neurons for action, there are mirror neurons for touch.
p115
aVIn other words, if somebody touches me,
p116
aVmy hand, neuron in the somatosensory cortex
p117
aVin the sensory region of the brain fires.
p118
aVBut the same neuron, in some cases, will fire
p119
aVwhen I simply watch another person being touched.
p120
aVSo, it's empathizing the other person being touched.
p121
aa(lp122
VSo, most of them will fire when I'm touched
p123
aVin different locations. Different neurons for different locations.
p124
aVBut a subset of them will fire even when I watch somebody else
p125
aVbeing touched in the same location.
p126
aVSo, here again you have neurons
p127
aVwhich are enrolled in empathy.
p128
aVNow, the question then arises: If I simply watch another person being touched,
p129
aVwhy do I not get confused and literally feel that touch sensation
p130
aVmerely by watching somebody being touched?
p131
aVI mean, I empathize with that person but I don't literally feel the touch.
p132
aVWell, that's because you've got receptors in your skin,
p133
aVtouch and pain receptors, going back into your brain
p134
aVand saying "Don't worry, you're not being touched.
p135
aVSo, empathize, by all means, with the other person,
p136
aVbut do not actually experience the touch,
p137
aVotherwise you'll get confused and muddled."
p138
aa(lp139
VOkay, so there is a feedback signal
p140
aVthat vetoes the signal of the mirror neuron
p141
aVpreventing you from consciously experiencing that touch.
p142
aVBut if you remove the arm, you simply anesthetize my arm,
p143
aVso you put an injection into my arm,
p144
aVanesthetize the brachial plexus, so the arm is numb,
p145
aVand there is no sensations coming in,
p146
aVif I now watch you being touched,
p147
aVI literally feel it in my hand.
p148
aVIn other words, you have dissolved the barrier
p149
aVbetween you and other human beings.
p150
aVSo, I call them Gandhi neurons, or empathy neurons.
p151
aV(Laughter)
p152
aa(lp153
VAnd this is not in some abstract metaphorical sense.
p154
aVAll that's separating you from him,
p155
aVfrom the other person, is your skin.
p156
aVRemove the skin, you experience that person's touch in your mind.
p157
aVYou've dissolved the barrier between you and other human beings.
p158
aVAnd this, of course, is the basis of much of Eastern philosophy,
p159
aVand that is there is no real independent self,
p160
aValoof from other human beings, inspecting the world,
p161
aVinspecting other people.
p162
aVYou are, in fact, connected not just via Facebook and Internet,
p163
aVyou're actually quite literally connected by your neurons.
p164
aVAnd there is whole chains of neurons around this room, talking to each other.
p165
aVAnd there is no real distinctiveness
p166
aVof your consciousness from somebody else's consciousness.
p167
aa(lp168
VAnd this is not mumbo-jumbo philosophy.
p169
aVIt emerges from our understanding of basic neuroscience.
p170
aVSo, you have a patient with a phantom limb. If the arm has been removed
p171
aVand you have a phantom, and you watch somebody else
p172
aVbeing touched, you feel it in your phantom.
p173
aVNow the astonishing thing is,
p174
aVif you have pain in your phantom limb, you squeeze the other person's hand,
p175
aVmassage the other person's hand,
p176
aVthat relieves the pain in your phantom hand,
p177
aValmost as though the neuron
p178
aVwere obtaining relief from merely
p179
aVwatching somebody else being massaged.
p180
aa(lp181
VSo, here you have my last slide.
p182
aVFor the longest time people have regarded science
p183
aVand humanities as being distinct.
p184
aVC.P. Snow spoke of the two cultures:
p185
aVscience on the one hand, humanities on the other;
p186
aVnever the twain shall meet.
p187
aVSo, I'm saying the mirror neuron system underlies the interface
p188
aVallowing you to rethink about issues like consciousness,
p189
aVrepresentation of self,
p190
aVwhat separates you from other human beings,
p191
aVwhat allows you to empathize with other human beings,
p192
aVand also even things like the emergence of culture and civilization,
p193
aVwhich is unique to human beings. Thank you.
