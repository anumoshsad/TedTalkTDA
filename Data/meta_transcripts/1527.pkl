VAs you might imagine, I'm absolutely passionate
p4
aVabout dance. I'm passionate about making it,
p5
aVabout watching it, about encouraging others
p6
aVto participate in it,
p7
aVand I'm also really passionate about creativity.
p8
aVCreativity for me is something that's absolutely critical,
p9
aVand I think it's something that you can teach.
p10
aVI think the technicities of creativity can be taught
p11
aVand shared, and I think you can find out things
p12
aVabout your own personal physical signature,
p13
aVyour own cognitive habits, and use that as
p14
aVa point of departure to misbehave beautifully.
p15
aa(lp16
VI was born in the 1970s, and John Travolta was big
p17
aVin those days: "Grease," "Saturday Night Fever,"
p18
aVand he provided a fantastic kind of male role model for me
p19
aVto start dancing. My parents were very up for me going.
p20
aVThey absolutely encouraged me to take risks, to go,
p21
aVto try, to try. I had an opportunity, an access
p22
aVto a local dance studio, and I had an enlightened teacher
p23
aVwho allowed me to make up my own and invent
p24
aVmy own dances, so what she did was let me make up
p25
aVmy own ballroom and Latin American dances to teach
p26
aVto my peers.
p27
aVAnd that was the very first time that I found an opportunity
p28
aVto feel that I was able to express my own voice,
p29
aVand that's what's fueled me, then, to become a choreographer.
p30
aVI feel like I've got something to say and something to share.
p31
aa(lp32
VAnd I guess what's interesting is, is that I am now obsessed
p33
aVwith the technology of the body.
p34
aVI think it's the most technologically literate thing that we have,
p35
aVand I'm absolutely obsessed with finding a way
p36
aVof communicating ideas through the body to audiences
p37
aVthat might move them, touch them,
p38
aVhelp them think differently about things.
p39
aa(lp40
VSo for me, choreography is very much a process
p41
aVof physical thinking. It's very much in mind,
p42
aVas well as in body, and it's a collaborative process.
p43
aVIt's something that I have to do with other people.
p44
aVYou know, it's a distributed cognitive process in a way.
p45
aVI work often with designers and visual artists,
p46
aVobviously dancers and other choreographers,
p47
aVbut also, more and more, with economists,
p48
aVanthropologists, neuroscientists, cognitive scientists,
p49
aVpeople really who come from very different domains of
p50
aVexpertise, where they bring their intelligence to bear
p51
aVon a different kind of creative process.
p52
aa(lp53
VWhat I thought we would do today a little bit is
p54
aVexplore this idea of physical thinking,
p55
aVand we're all experts in physical thinking.
p56
aVYeah, you all have a body, right?
p57
aVAnd we all know what that body is like in the real world,
p58
aVso one of the aspects of physical thinking
p59
aVthat we think about a lot is this notion of proprioception,
p60
aVthe sense of my own body in the space in the real world.
p61
aVSo, we all understand what it feels like to know
p62
aVwhere the ends of your fingers are
p63
aVwhen you hold out your arms, yeah?
p64
aVYou absolutely know that when you're going to grab a cup,
p65
aVor that cup moves and you have to renavigate it.
p66
aVSo we're experts in physical thinking already.
p67
aVWe just don't think about our bodies very much.
p68
aVWe only think about them when they go wrong, so, when
p69
aVthere's a broken arm, or when you have a heart attack,
p70
aVthen you become really very aware of your bodies.
p71
aVBut how is it that we can start to think about using
p72
aVchoreographic thinking, kinesthetic intelligence, to arm
p73
aVthe ways in which we think about things more generally?
p74
aa(lp75
VWhat I thought I'd do is, I'd make a TED premiere.
p76
aVI'm not sure if this is going to be good or not.
p77
aVI'll just be doing it.
p78
aVI thought what I'd do is, I'd use three versions
p79
aVof physical thinking to make something.
p80
aa(lp81
VI want to introduce you. This is Paolo. This is Catarina.
p82
aa(lp83
V(Applause)
p84
aa(lp85
VThey have no idea what we're going to do.
p86
aVSo this is not the type of choreography where
p87
aVI already have in mind what I'm going to make,
p88
aVwhere I've fixed the routine in my head
p89
aVand I'm just going to teach it to them,
p90
aVand these so-called empty vessels are just going to learn it.
p91
aVThat's not the methodology at all that we work with.
p92
aVBut what's important about it is how it is that they're
p93
aVgrasping information, how they're taking information,
p94
aVhow they're using it, and how they're thinking with it.
p95
aa(lp96
VI'm going to start really, really simply.
p97
aVUsually, dance has a stimulus or stimuli, and I thought
p98
aVI'd take something simple, TED logo, we can all see it,
p99
aVit's quite easy to work with, and I'm going to do something
p100
aVvery simply, where you take one idea from a body,
p101
aVand it happens to be my body, and translate that
p102
aVinto somebody else's body,
p103
aVso it's a direct transfer, transformation of energy.
p104
aa(lp105
VAnd I'm going to imagine this, you can do this too if you like,
p106
aVthat I'm going to just take the letter "T" and I'm going
p107
aVto imagine it in mind, and I'm going to place that outside in
p108
aVthe real world. So I absolutely see a letter "T" in front of me.
p109
aVYeah? It's absolutely there.
p110
aVI can absolutely walk around it when I see it, yeah?
p111
aVIt has a kind of a grammar. I know what I'm going to do
p112
aVwith it, and I can start to describe it, so I can describe it
p113
aVvery simply. I can describe it in my arms, right?
p114
aVSo all I did was take my hand and then I move my hand.
p115
aVI can describe it, whoa, in my head, you know? Whoa.
p116
aVOkay. I can do also my shoulder. Yeah?
p117
aVIt gives me something to do, something to work towards.
p118
aVIf I were to take that letter "T" and flatten it down
p119
aVon the floor, here, maybe just off the floor,
p120
aVall of a sudden I could do maybe something with my knee,
p121
aVyeah? Whoa. So If I put the knee and the arms together,
p122
aVI've got something physical, yeah? And I can start to build something.
p123
aVSo what I'm going to do just for one and a half minutes or so
p124
aVis I'm going to take that concept, I'm going to make something,
p125
aVand the dancers behind me are going to interpret it,
p126
aVthey're going to snapshot it, they're going to take
p127
aVaspects of it, and it's almost like I'm offloading memory
p128
aVand they're holding onto memory? Yeah?
p129
aVAnd we'll see what we come up with.
p130
aVSo just have a little watch about how they're, how they're
p131
aVaccessing this and what they're doing,
p132
aVand I'm just going to take this letter "T," the letter "E,"
p133
aVand the letter "D," to make something. Okay. Here goes.
p134
aa(lp135
VSo I have to get myself in the zone. Right.
p136
aa(lp137
VIt's a bit of a cross of my arm.
p138
aa(lp139
VSo all I'm doing is exploring this space of "T"
p140
aVand flashing through it with some action.
p141
aVI'm not remembering what I'm doing.
p142
aVI'm just working on my task. My task is this "T."
p143
aVGoing to watch it from the side, whoa.
p144
aVStrike moment.
p145
aVThat's it.
p146
aa(lp147
VSo we're starting to build a phrase.
p148
aa(lp149
VSo what they're doing, let's see, something like that,
p150
aVso what they're doing is grasping aspects of that movement
p151
aVand they're generating it into a phrase.
p152
aVYou can see the speed is extremely quick, yeah?
p153
aVI'm not asking them to copy exactly.
p154
aVThey're using the information that they receive
p155
aVto generate the beginnings of a phrase.
p156
aVI can watch that and that can tell me something
p157
aVabout how it is that they're moving.
p158
aVYeah, they're super quick, right?
p159
aa(lp160
VSo I've taken this aspect of TED and translated it
p161
aVinto something that's physical.
p162
aVSome dancers, when they're watching action,
p163
aVtake the overall shape, the arc of the movement,
p164
aVthe kinetic sense of the movement,
p165
aVand use that for memory.
p166
aVSome work very much in specific detail.
p167
aVThey start with small little units and build it up.
p168
aVOkay, you've got something? One more thing.
p169
aa(lp170
VSo they're solving this problem for me,
p171
aVhaving a little \u2014
p172
aVThey're constructing that phrase.
p173
aVThey have something and they're going to hold on to it,
p174
aVyeah? One way of making.
p175
aVThat's going to be my beginning in this world premiere.
p176
aa(lp177
VOkay. From there I'm going to do a very different thing.
p178
aVSo basically I'm going to make a duet.
p179
aVI want you to think about them as architectural objects,
p180
aVso what they are, are just pure lines.
p181
aVThey're no longer people, just pure lines, and I'm going
p182
aVto work with them almost as objects to think with, yeah?
p183
aVSo what I'm thinking about is taking
p184
aVa few physical extensions from the body as I move, and
p185
aVI move them, and I do that by suggesting things to them:
p186
aVIf, then; if, then. Okay, so here we go.
p187
aa(lp188
VJust grab this arm.
p189
aVCan you place that down into the floor?
p190
aVYeah, down to the floor. Can you go underneath?
p191
aVYeah. Cat, can you put leg over that side? Yeah.
p192
aVCan you rotate?
p193
aVWhoom, just go back to the beginning.
p194
aVHere we go, ready? And ... bam, bake ... (clicks metronome)
p195
aVGreat. Okay, from there, you're both getting up.
p196
aVYou're both getting up. Here we go. Good, now? Them.
p197
aa(lp198
V(Applause)
p199
aa(lp200
VSo from there, from there, we're both getting up,
p201
aVwe're both getting up, going in this direction,
p202
aVgoing underneath. Whoa, whoa, underneath.
p203
aVWhoa, underneath, whoo-um. Yeah? Underneath. Jump.
p204
aVUnderneath. Jump. Paolo, kick. Don't care where. Kick.
p205
aVKick, replace, change a leg. Kick, replace, change the leg.
p206
aVYeah? Okay? Cat, almost get his head. Almost get his head.
p207
aVWhoaa. Just after it, maybe. Whoaa, whaaay, ooh.
p208
aVGrab her waist, come up back into her first, whoom, spin,
p209
aVturn her, whoo-aa. (Snaps) Great.
p210
aVOkay, let's have a little go from the beginning of that.
p211
aVJust, let me slow down here. Fancy having eight \u2014 (Laughter)
p212
aa(lp213
VFancy having eight hours with me in a day.
p214
aVSo, maybe too much. So, here we go, ready, and \u2014 (Clicks metronome)
p215
aa(lp216
V(Clicks metronome)
p217
aa(lp218
VNice, good job. Yeah? Okay. (Applause)
p219
aVOkay, not bad. (Applause) A little bit more?
p220
aVYeah. Just a little bit more, here we go, from that place.
p221
aVSeparate. Face the front. Separate. Face the front.
p222
aVImagine that there's a circle in front of you, yeah?
p223
aVAvoid it. Avoid it. Whoom. Kick it out of the way.
p224
aVKick it out of the way. Throw it into the audience. Whoom.
p225
aVThrow it into the audience again.
p226
aVWe've got mental architecture, we're sharing it,
p227
aVtherefore solving a problem. They're enacting it.
p228
aVLet me just see that a little bit. Ready, and go.
p229
aa(lp230
V(Clicks metronome)
p231
aa(lp232
VOkay, brilliant. Okay, here we go. From the beginning,
p233
aVcan we do our phrases first? And then that.
p234
aVAnd we're going to build something now, organize it,
p235
aVthe phrases. Here we go. Nice and slow?
p236
aVReady and go ... um. (Clicks metronome)
p237
aa(lp238
V(Clicks metronome)
p239
aVThe duet starts. (Clicks metronome)
p240
aV(Clicks metronome)
p241
aVSo yeah, okay, good. Okay, nice, very nice. (Applause)
p242
aa(lp243
VSo good. So \u2014 (Applause)
p244
aVOkay. So that was \u2014 (Applause)
p245
aVWell done. (Applause)
p246
aa(lp247
VThat was the second way of working.
p248
aVThe first one, body-to-body transfer, yeah,
p249
aVwith an outside mental architecture that I work with
p250
aVthat they hold memory with for me.
p251
aVThe second one, which is using them as objects to think
p252
aVwith their architectural objects, I do a series of
p253
aVprovocations, I say, "If this happens, then that.
p254
aVIf this, if that happens \u2014 " I've got lots of methods like that,
p255
aVbut it's very, very quick, and this is a third method.
p256
aVThey're starting it already, and this is a task-based method,
p257
aVwhere they have the autonomy to make
p258
aVall of the decisions for themselves.
p259
aa(lp260
VSo I'd like us just to do, we're going to do a little
p261
aVmental dance, a little, in this little one minute,
p262
aVso what I'd love you to do is imagine,
p263
aVyou can do this with your eyes closed, or open, and if you
p264
aVdon't want to do it you can watch them, it's up to you.
p265
aVJust for a second, think about that word "TED" in front of
p266
aVyou, so it's in mind, and it's there right in front of your mind.
p267
aVWhat I'd like you to do is transplant that outside
p268
aVinto the real world, so just imagine that word "TED"
p269
aVin the real world.
p270
aVWhat I'd like you to do what that is take an aspect of it.
p271
aVI'm going to zone in on the "E," and I'm going to
p272
aVscale that "E" so it's absolutely massive,
p273
aVso I'm scaling that "E" so it's absolutely massive,
p274
aVand then I'm going to give it dimensionality.
p275
aVI'm going to think about it in 3D space. So now,
p276
aVinstead of it just being a letter that's in front of me,
p277
aVit's a space that my body can go inside of.
p278
aVI now decide where I'm going to be in that space,
p279
aVso I'm down on this small part of the bottom rib
p280
aVof the letter "E," and I'm thinking about it, and I'm imagining
p281
aVthis space that's really high and above. If I asked you to
p282
aVreach out \u2014 you don't have to literally do it, but in mind \u2014
p283
aVreach out to the top of the "E," where would you reach?
p284
aVIf you reach with your finger, where would it be?
p285
aVIf you reach with your elbow, where would it be?
p286
aVIf I already then said about that space that you're in,
p287
aVlet's infuse it with the color red, what does that do
p288
aVto the body? If I then said to you, what happens if
p289
aVthat whole wall on the side of "E" collapses and you have to
p290
aVuse your weight to put it back up,
p291
aVwhat would you be able to do with it?
p292
aa(lp293
VSo this is a mental picture, I'm describing a mental,
p294
aVvivid picture that enables dancers to make choices
p295
aVfor themselves about what to make.
p296
aa(lp297
VOkay, you can open your eyes if you had them closed.
p298
aa(lp299
VSo the dancers have been working on them.
p300
aVSo just keep working on them for a little second.
p301
aVSo they've been working on those mental architectures in the here.
p302
aVI know, I think we should keep them as a surprise.
p303
aa(lp304
VSo here goes, world premiere dance. Yeah? Here we go.
p305
aVTED dance. Okay. Here it comes. I'm going to organize it quickly.
p306
aVSo, you're going to do the first solo that we made,
p307
aVyeah blah blah blah blah, we go into the duet, yeah,
p308
aVblah blah blah blah. The next solo, blah blah blah blah,
p309
aVyeah, and both at the same time, you do the last solutions.
p310
aa(lp311
VOkay? Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, world premiere,
p312
aVTED dance, three versions of physical thinking. (Applause)
p313
aVWell, clap afterwards, let's see if it's any good, yeah? (Laughter)
p314
aVSo yeah, let's clap \u2014 yeah, let's clap afterwards.
p315
aVHere we go. Catarina, big moment, here we go, one.
p316
aa(lp317
V(Clicks metronome)
p318
aVHere it comes, Cat. (Clicks metronome)
p319
aVPaolo, go. (Clicks metronome) Last you solo.
p320
aVThe one you made. (Clicks metronome)
p321
aV(Clicks metronome)
p322
aVWell done. Okay, good. Super. So \u2014
p323
aa(lp324
V(Applause)
p325
aVSo \u2014 (Applause)
p326
aVThank you. (Applause)
p327
aVSo \u2014 three versions. (Applause) Oh. (Laughs)
p328
aV(Applause) Three versions of physical thinking, yeah?
p329
aVThree versions of physical thinking. I'm hoping that today,
p330
aVwhat you're going to do is go away and make a dance
p331
aVfor yourself, and if not that,
p332
aVat least misbehave more beautifully, more often.
p333
aa(lp334
VThank you very much. (Applause)
p335
aVThank you. Thank you. (Applause)
