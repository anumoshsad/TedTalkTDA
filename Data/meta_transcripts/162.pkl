VI would like to tell you about a project which I started about 16 years ago.
p4
aVIt's about making new forms of life.
p5
aVAnd these are made of this kind of tube \u2014
p6
aVelectricity tube, we call it in Holland.
p7
aVAnd we can start a film about that,
p8
aVand we can see a little bit backwards in time.
p9
aa(lp10
V(Video) Narrator: Eventually, these beasts are going to live in herds on the beaches.
p11
aVTheo Jansen is working hard on this evolution.
p12
aa(lp13
VTheo Jansen: I want to put these forms of life on the beaches.
p14
aVAnd they should survive over there,
p15
aVon their own, in the future.
p16
aVLearning to live on their own \u2014
p17
aVand it'll take couple of more years
p18
aVto let them walk on their own.
p19
aa(lp20
VNarrator: The mechanical beasts will not get their energy from food,
p21
aVbut from the wind.
p22
aVThe wind will move feathers on their back, which will drive their feet.
p23
aVThe beast walks sideways on the wet sand of the beach,
p24
aVwith its nose pointed into the wind.
p25
aVAs soon as it walks into either the rolling surf or the dry sand,
p26
aVit stops, and walks in the opposite direction.
p27
aa(lp28
VEvolution has generated many species.
p29
aa(lp30
V(Music)
p31
aa(lp32
VThis is the Animaris Currens Ventosa.
p33

V(Music)

V(Laughter)

aa(lp38
V(Applause)
p39
aa(lp40
VTJ: This is a herd, and it is built according to genetic codes.
p41
aVAnd it is a sort of race, and each and every animal is different,
p42
aVand the winning codes will multiply.
p43
aa(lp44
VThis is the wave, going from left to right.
p45
aVYou can see this one.
p46
aVYes, and now it goes from left to right.
p47
aVThis is a new generation, a new family,
p48
aVwhich is able to store the wind.
p49
aVSo, the wings pump up air in lemonade bottles,
p50
aVwhich are on top of that.
p51
aVAnd they can use that energy in case the wind falls away,
p52
aVand the tide is coming up,
p53
aVand there is still a little bit of energy to reach the dunes and save their lives,
p54
aVbecause they are drowned very easily.
p55
aa(lp56
V(Laughter)
p57
aa(lp58
VI could show you this animal.
p59
aa(lp60
V(Applause)
p61
aa(lp62
VThank you.
p63
aa(lp64
V(Applause)
p65
aa(lp66
VSo, the proportion of the tubes in this animal is very important for the walking.
p67
aVThere are 11 numbers, which I call The 11 Holy Numbers.
p68
aVThese are the distances of the tubes which make it walk that way.
p69
aVIn fact, it's a new invention of the wheel.
p70
aVIt works the same as a wheel.
p71
aVThe axis of a wheel stays on the same level,
p72
aVand this hip is staying on the same level as well.
p73
aVIn fact, this is better than a wheel,
p74
aVbecause when you try to drive your bicycle on the beach,
p75
aVyou will notice it's very hard to do.
p76
aVAnd the feet just step over the sand,
p77
aVand the wheel has to touch every piece of the ground in-between.
p78
aVSo 5,000 years after the invention of the wheel,
p79
aVwe have a new wheel.
p80
aVI will show you, in the next video \u2014
p81
aVcan you start it, please? \u2014
p82
aVthat very heavy loads can be moved.
p83
aVThere's a guy pushing there, behind,
p84
aVbut it can also walk on the wind very well.
p85
aVIt's 3.2 tons.
p86
aa(lp87
VThis is working on the stored wind in the bottles.
p88
aVIt has a feeler, where it can feel obstacles and turn around.
p89
aVYou see, it's going the other way.
p90
aa(lp91
VCan I have the feeler here?
p92
aVOK. Good.
p93
aVSo, they have to survive all the dangers of the beach,
p94
aVand one of the big dangers is the sea.
p95
aVThis is the sea.
p96
aVAnd it must feel the water of the sea.
p97
aVAnd this is the water feeler,
p98
aVand what's very important is this tube.
p99
aVIt sucks in air normally,
p100
aVbut when it swallows water, it feels the resistance of it.
p101
aVSo, imagine that the animal is walking towards the sea.
p102
aVAs soon as it touches the water \u2014
p103
aVyou should hear a sound of running air.
p104
aa(lp105
V(Sound of running air)
p106
aa(lp107
VYes!
p108
aVSo if it doesn't feel, it will be drowned, OK?
p109
aa(lp110
VHere we have the brain of the animal.
p111
aVIn fact, it is a step counter, and it counts the steps.
p112
aVIt's a binary step counter.
p113
aVSo as soon it has been to the sea,
p114
aVit changes the pattern of zeroes and ones here.
p115
aVAnd it always knows where it is on the beach.
p116
aVSo it's very simple brain.
p117
aVIt says, well, there's the sea, there are dunes, and I'm here.
p118
aVSo it's a sort of imagination of the simple world of the beach animal.
p119
aa(lp120
VThank you.
p121
aa(lp122
VOne of the biggest enemies are the storms.
p123
aVThis is a part of the nose of the Animaris Percipiere.
p124
aVWhen the nose of the animal is fixed, the whole animal is fixed.
p125
aVSo when the storm is coming up,
p126
aVit drives a pin into the ground.
p127
aa(lp128
V(Laughter)
p129
aa(lp130
VAudience member: Wow!
p131
aa(lp132
VThe nose is fixed, the whole animal is fixed.
p133
aVThe wind may turn, but the animal will always turn its nose into the wind.
p134
aVNow, another couple of years, and these animals will survive on their own.
p135
aVI still have to help them a lot.
p136
aa(lp137
VThank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
