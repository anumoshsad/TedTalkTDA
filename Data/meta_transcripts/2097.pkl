VI am an engineering professor,
p4
aVand for the past 14 years
p5
aVI've been teaching crap.
p6
aV(Laughter)
p7
aVNot that I'm a bad teacher,
p8
aVbut I've been studying and teaching
p9
aVabout human waste
p10
aVand how waste is conveyed
p11
aVthrough these wastewater treatment plants,
p12
aVand how we engineer and design
p13
aVthese treatment plants so that we can protect
p14
aVsurface water like rivers.
p15
aa(lp16
VI've based my scientific career
p17
aVon using leading-edge molecular techniques,
p18
aVDNA- and RNA-based methods
p19
aVto look at microbial populations in biological reactors,
p20
aVand again to optimize these systems.
p21
aVAnd over the years,
p22
aVI have developed an unhealthy obsession with toilets,
p23
aVand I've been known to sneak into toilets
p24
aVand take my camera phone
p25
aVall over the world.
p26
aa(lp27
VBut along the way, I've learned
p28
aVthat it's not just the technical side,
p29
aVbut there's also this thing called the culture of crap.
p30
aVSo for example,
p31
aVhow many of you are washers
p32
aVand how many of you are wipers?
p33
aV(Laughter)
p34
aVIf, well, I guess you know what I mean.
p35
aVIf you're a washer, then you use water
p36
aVfor anal cleansing. That's the technical term.
p37
aVAnd if you're a wiper,
p38
aVthen you use toilet paper
p39
aVor, in some regions of the world
p40
aVwhere it's not available, newspaper
p41
aVor rags or corncobs.
p42
aa(lp43
VAnd this is not just a piece of trivia,
p44
aVbut it's really important to understand
p45
aVand solve the sanitation problem.
p46
aVAnd it is a big problem:
p47
aVThere are 2.5 billion people in the world
p48
aVwho don't have access to adequate sanitation.
p49
aVFor them, there's no modern toilet.
p50
aVAnd there are 1.1 billion people
p51
aVwhose toilets are the streets
p52
aVor river banks or open spaces,
p53
aVand again, the technical term for that is
p54
aVopen defecation,
p55
aVbut that is really simply
p56
aVshitting in the open.
p57
aVAnd if you're living in fecal material
p58
aVand it's surrounding you, you're going to get sick.
p59
aVIt's going to get into your drinking water,
p60
aVinto your food, into your immediate surroundings.
p61
aVSo the United Nations estimates
p62
aVthat every year, there are  1.5 million child deaths
p63
aVbecause of inadequate sanitation.
p64
aVThat's one preventable death every 20 seconds,
p65
aV171 every hour,
p66
aV4,100 every day.
p67
aVAnd so, to avoid open defecation,
p68
aVmunicipalities and cities
p69
aVbuild infrastructure, for example, like pit latrines,
p70
aVin peri-urban and rural areas.
p71
aVFor example, in KwaZulu-Natal  province in South Africa,
p72
aVthey've built tens of thousands of these pit latrines.
p73
aVBut there's a problem when you scale up
p74
aVto tens of thousands, and the problem is,
p75
aVwhat happens when the pits are full?
p76
aVThis is what happens.
p77
aVPeople defecate around the toilet.
p78
aVIn schools, children defecate on the floors
p79
aVand then leave a trail outside the building
p80
aVand start defecating around the building,
p81
aVand these pits have to be cleaned
p82
aVand manually emptied.
p83
aVAnd who does the emptying?
p84
aVYou've got these workers
p85
aVwho have to sometimes go down into the pits
p86
aVand manually remove the contents.
p87
aVIt's a dirty and dangerous business.
p88
aVAs you can see, there's no protective equipment,
p89
aVno protective clothing.
p90
aVThere's one worker down there.
p91
aVI hope you can see him.
p92
aVHe's got a face mask on, but no shirt.
p93
aVAnd in some countries, like India,
p94
aVthe lower castes are condemned
p95
aVto empty the pits,
p96
aVand they're further condemned by society.
p97
aa(lp98
VSo you ask yourself, how can we solve this
p99
aVand why don't we just build Western-style flush toilets
p100
aVfor these two and a half billion?
p101
aVAnd the answer is, it's just not possible.
p102
aVIn some of these areas, there's not enough water,
p103
aVthere's no energy,
p104
aVit's going to cost tens of trillions of dollars
p105
aVto lay out the sewer lines
p106
aVand to build the facilities
p107
aVand to operate and maintain these systems,
p108
aVand if you don't build it right,
p109
aVyou're going to have flush toilets
p110
aVthat basically go straight into the river,
p111
aVjust like what's happening in many cities
p112
aVin the developing world.
p113
aVAnd is this really the solution?
p114
aVBecause essentially, what you're doing is
p115
aVyou're using clean water
p116
aVand you're using it to flush your toilet,
p117
aVconvey it to a wastewater treatment plant
p118
aVwhich then discharges to a river,
p119
aVand that river, again, is a drinking water source.
p120
aa(lp121
VSo we've got to rethink sanitation,
p122
aVand we've got to reinvent the sanitation infrastructure,
p123
aVand I'm going to argue that to do this,
p124
aVyou have to employ systems thinking.
p125
aVWe have to look at the whole sanitation chain.
p126
aVWe start with a human interface,
p127
aVand then we have to think about how feces
p128
aVare collected and stored,
p129
aVtransported, treated and reused \u2014
p130
aVand not just disposal but reuse.
p131
aa(lp132
VSo let's start with the human user interface.
p133
aVI say, it doesn't matter if you're a washer or a wiper,
p134
aVa sitter or a squatter,
p135
aVthe human user interface should be clean
p136
aVand easy to use, because after all,
p137
aVtaking a dump should be pleasurable.
p138
aV(Laughter)
p139
aVAnd when we open the possibilities
p140
aVto understanding this sanitation chain,
p141
aVthen the back-end technology,
p142
aVthe collection to the reuse, should not really matter,
p143
aVand then we can apply
p144
aVlocally adoptable and context-sensitive solutions.
p145
aVSo we can open ourselves to possibilities like,
p146
aVfor example, this urine-diverting toilet,
p147
aVand there's two holes in this toilet.
p148
aVThere's the front and the back,
p149
aVand the front collects the urine,
p150
aVand the back collects the fecal material.
p151
aVAnd so what you're doing is you're separating the urine,
p152
aVwhich has 80 percent of the nitrogen
p153
aVand 50 percent of the phosphorus,
p154
aVand then that can then be treated
p155
aVand precipitated to form things like struvite,
p156
aVwhich is a high-value fertilizer,
p157
aVand then the fecal material can then be disinfected
p158
aVand again converted to high-value end products.
p159
aVOr, for example, in some of our research,
p160
aVyou can reuse the water by treating it
p161
aVin on-site sanitation systems
p162
aVlike planter boxes or constructed wetlands.
p163
aVSo we can open up all these possibilities
p164
aVif we take away the old paradigm of flush toilets
p165
aVand treatment plants.
p166
aa(lp167
VSo you might be asking, who's going to pay?
p168
aVWell, I'm going to argue that governments
p169
aVshould fund sanitation infrastructure.
p170
aVNGOs and donor organizations,
p171
aVthey can do their best, but it's not going to be enough.
p172
aVGovernments should fund sanitation
p173
aVthe same way they fund roads
p174
aVand schools and hospitals
p175
aVand other infrastructure like bridges,
p176
aVbecause we know, and the WHO has done this study,
p177
aVthat for every dollar that we invest
p178
aVin sanitation infrastructure,
p179
aVwe get something like three to 34 dollars back.
p180
aa(lp181
VLet's go back to the problem of pit emptying.
p182
aVSo at North Carolina State University,
p183
aVwe challenged our students to come up with a simple solution,
p184
aVand this is what they came up with:
p185
aVa simple, modified screw auger
p186
aVthat can move the waste up
p187
aVfrom the pit and into a collecting drum,
p188
aVand now the pit worker
p189
aVdoesn't have to go down into the pit.
p190
aVWe tested it in South Africa, and it works.
p191
aVWe need to make it more robust,
p192
aVand we're going to do more testing
p193
aVin Malawi and South Africa this coming year.
p194
aVAnd our idea is to make this
p195
aVa professionalized pit-emptying service
p196
aVso that we can create a small business out of it,
p197
aVcreate profits and jobs,
p198
aVand the hope is that,
p199
aVas we are rethinking sanitation,
p200
aVwe are extending the life of these pits
p201
aVso that we don't have to resort
p202
aVto quick solutions
p203
aVthat don't really make sense.
p204
aa(lp205
VI believe that access to adequate sanitation
p206
aVis a basic human right.
p207
aVWe need to stop the practice
p208
aVof lower castes and lower-status people
p209
aVgoing down and being condemned to empty pits.
p210
aVIt is our moral, it is our social
p211
aVand our environmental obligation.
