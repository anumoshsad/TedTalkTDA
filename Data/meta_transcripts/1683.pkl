VThe most massive
p4
aVtsunami perfect storm
p5
aVis bearing down upon us.
p6
aVThis perfect storm
p7
aVis mounting a grim reality, increasingly grim reality,
p8
aVand we are facing that reality
p9
aVwith the full belief
p10
aVthat we can solve our problems with technology,
p11
aVand that's very understandable.
p12
aVNow, this perfect storm that we are facing
p13
aVis the result of our rising population,
p14
aVrising towards 10 billion people,
p15
aVland that is turning to desert,
p16
aVand, of course, climate change.
p17
aa(lp18
VNow there's no question about it at all:
p19
aVwe will only solve the problem
p20
aVof replacing fossil fuels with technology.
p21
aVBut fossil fuels, carbon \u2014 coal and gas \u2014
p22
aVare by no means the only thing
p23
aVthat is causing climate change.
p24
aa(lp25
VDesertification
p26
aVis a fancy word for land that is turning to desert,
p27
aVand this happens only when
p28
aVwe create too much bare ground.
p29
aVThere's no other cause.
p30
aVAnd I intend to focus
p31
aVon most of the world's land that is turning to desert.
p32
aa(lp33
VBut I have for you a very simple message
p34
aVthat offers more hope than you can imagine.
p35
aVWe have environments
p36
aVwhere humidity is guaranteed throughout the year.
p37
aVOn those, it is almost impossible
p38
aVto create vast areas of bare ground.
p39
aVNo matter what you do, nature covers it up so quickly.
p40
aVAnd we have environments
p41
aVwhere we have months of humidity
p42
aVfollowed by months of dryness,
p43
aVand that is where desertification is occurring.
p44
aVFortunately, with space technology now,
p45
aVwe can look at it from space,
p46
aVand when we do, you can see the proportions fairly well.
p47
aVGenerally, what you see in green
p48
aVis not desertifying,
p49
aVand what you see in brown is,
p50
aVand these are by far the greatest areas of the Earth.
p51
aVAbout two thirds, I would guess, of the world is desertifying.
p52
aa(lp53
VI took this picture in the Tihamah Desert
p54
aVwhile 25 millimeters \u2014 that's an inch of rain \u2014 was falling.
p55
aVThink of it in terms of drums of water,
p56
aVeach containing 200 liters.
p57
aVOver 1,000 drums of water fell on every hectare
p58
aVof that land that day.
p59
aVThe next day, the land looked like this.
p60
aVWhere had that water gone?
p61
aVSome of it ran off as flooding,
p62
aVbut most of the water that soaked into the soil
p63
aVsimply evaporated out again,
p64
aVexactly as it does in your garden
p65
aVif you leave the soil uncovered.
p66
aVNow, because the fate of water and carbon
p67
aVare tied to soil organic matter,
p68
aVwhen we damage soils, you give off carbon.
p69
aVCarbon goes back to the atmosphere.
p70
aa(lp71
VNow you're told over and over, repeatedly,
p72
aVthat desertification is only occurring
p73
aVin arid and semi-arid areas of the world,
p74
aVand that tall grasslands like this one
p75
aVin high rainfall are of no consequence.
p76
aVBut if you do not look at grasslands but look down into them,
p77
aVyou find that most of the soil in that grassland
p78
aVthat you've just seen is bare and covered with a crust of algae,
p79
aVleading to increased runoff and evaporation.
p80
aVThat is the cancer of desertification
p81
aVthat we do not recognize till its terminal form.
p82
aa(lp83
VNow we know that desertification is caused by livestock,
p84
aVmostly cattle, sheep and goats,
p85
aVovergrazing the plants,
p86
aVleaving the soil bare and giving off methane.
p87
aVAlmost everybody knows this,
p88
aVfrom nobel laureates to golf caddies,
p89
aVor was taught it, as I was.
p90
aVNow, the environments like you see here,
p91
aVdusty environments in Africa where I grew up,
p92
aVand I loved wildlife,
p93
aVand so I grew up hating livestock
p94
aVbecause of the damage they were doing.
p95
aVAnd then my university education as an ecologist
p96
aVreinforced my beliefs.
p97
aa(lp98
VWell, I have news for you.
p99
aVWe were once just as certain
p100
aVthat the world was flat.
p101
aVWe were wrong then, and we are wrong again.
p102
aVAnd I want to invite you now
p103
aVto come along on my journey of reeducation and discovery.
p104
aa(lp105
VWhen I was a young man,
p106
aVa young biologist in Africa,
p107
aVI was involved in setting aside marvelous areas
p108
aVas future national parks.
p109
aVNow no sooner \u2014 this was in the 1950s \u2014
p110
aVand no sooner did we remove the hunting,
p111
aVdrum-beating people to protect the animals,
p112
aVthan the land began to deteriorate,
p113
aVas you see in this park that we formed.
p114
aVNow, no livestock were involved,
p115
aVbut suspecting that we had too many elephants now,
p116
aVI did the research and I proved we had too many,
p117
aVand I recommended that we would have to reduce their numbers
p118
aVand bring them down to a level that the land could sustain.
p119
aVNow, that was a terrible decision for me to have to make,
p120
aVand it was political dynamite, frankly.
p121
aVSo our government formed a team of experts
p122
aVto evaluate my research.
p123
aVThey did. They agreed with me,
p124
aVand over the following years,
p125
aVwe shot 40,000 elephants to try to stop the damage.
p126
aVAnd it got worse, not better.
p127
aVLoving elephants as I do,
p128
aVthat was the saddest and greatest blunder of my life,
p129
aVand I will carry that to my grave.
p130
aVOne good thing did come out of it.
p131
aVIt made me absolutely determined
p132
aVto devote my life to finding solutions.
p133
aa(lp134
VWhen I came to the United States, I got a shock,
p135
aVto find national parks like this one
p136
aVdesertifying as badly as anything in Africa.
p137
aVAnd there'd been no livestock on this land
p138
aVfor over 70 years.
p139
aVAnd I found that American scientists
p140
aVhad no explanation for this
p141
aVexcept that it is arid and natural.
p142
aVSo I then began looking
p143
aVat all the research plots I could
p144
aVover the whole of the Western United States
p145
aVwhere cattle had been removed
p146
aVto prove that it would stop desertification,
p147
aVbut I found the opposite,
p148
aVas we see on this research station,
p149
aVwhere this grassland that was green in 1961,
p150
aVby 2002 had changed to that situation.
p151
aVAnd the authors of the position paper on climate change
p152
aVfrom which I obtained these pictures
p153
aVattribute this change to "unknown processes."
p154
aa(lp155
VClearly, we have never understood
p156
aVwhat is causing desertification,
p157
aVwhich has destroyed many civilizations
p158
aVand now threatens us globally.
p159
aVWe have never understood it.
p160
aVTake one square meter of soil
p161
aVand make it bare like this is down here,
p162
aVand I promise you, you will find it much colder at dawn
p163
aVand much hotter at midday
p164
aVthan that same piece of ground if it's just covered with litter,
p165
aVplant litter.
p166
aVYou have changed the microclimate.
p167
aVNow, by the time you are doing that
p168
aVand increasing greatly the percentage of bare ground
p169
aVon more than half the world's land,
p170
aVyou are changing macroclimate.
p171
aVBut we have just simply not understood
p172
aVwhy was it beginning to happen 10,000 years ago?
p173
aVWhy has it accelerated lately?
p174
aVWe had no understanding of that.
p175
aa(lp176
VWhat we had failed to understand
p177
aVwas that these seasonal humidity environments of the world,
p178
aVthe soil and the vegetation
p179
aVdeveloped with very large numbers of grazing animals,
p180
aVand that these grazing animals
p181
aVdeveloped with ferocious pack-hunting predators.
p182
aVNow, the main defense against pack-hunting predators
p183
aVis to get into herds,
p184
aVand the larger the herd, the safer the individuals.
p185
aVNow, large herds dung and urinate all over their own food,
p186
aVand they have to keep moving,
p187
aVand it was that movement
p188
aVthat prevented the overgrazing of plants,
p189
aVwhile the periodic trampling
p190
aVensured good cover of the soil,
p191
aVas we see where a herd has passed.
p192
aa(lp193
VThis picture is a typical seasonal grassland.
p194
aVIt has just come through four months of rain,
p195
aVand it's now going into eight months of dry season.
p196
aVAnd watch the change as it goes into this long dry season.
p197
aVNow, all of that grass you see aboveground
p198
aVhas to decay biologically
p199
aVbefore the next growing season, and if it doesn't,
p200
aVthe grassland and the soil begin to die.
p201
aVNow, if it does not decay biologically,
p202
aVit shifts to oxidation, which is a very slow process,
p203
aVand this smothers and kills grasses,
p204
aVleading to a shift to woody vegetation
p205
aVand bare soil, releasing carbon.
p206
aVTo prevent that, we have traditionally used fire.
p207
aVBut fire also leaves the soil bare, releasing carbon,
p208
aVand worse than that,
p209
aVburning one hectare of grassland
p210
aVgives off more, and more damaging, pollutants
p211
aVthan 6,000 cars.
p212
aVAnd we are burning in Africa, every single year,
p213
aVmore than one billion hectares of grasslands,
p214
aVand almost nobody is talking about it.
p215
aVWe justify the burning, as scientists,
p216
aVbecause it does remove the dead material
p217
aVand it allows the plants to grow.
p218
aa(lp219
VNow, looking at this grassland of ours that has gone dry,
p220
aVwhat could we do to keep that healthy?
p221
aVAnd bear in mind, I'm talking of most of the world's land now.
p222
aVOkay? We cannot reduce animal numbers to rest it more
p223
aVwithout causing desertification and climate change.
p224
aVWe cannot burn it without causing
p225
aVdesertification and climate change.
p226
aVWhat are we going to do?
p227
aVThere is only one option,
p228
aVI'll repeat to you, only one option
p229
aVleft to climatologists and scientists,
p230
aVand that is to do the unthinkable,
p231
aVand to use livestock,
p232
aVbunched and moving,
p233
aVas a proxy for former herds and predators,
p234
aVand mimic nature.
p235
aVThere is no other alternative left to mankind.
p236
aa(lp237
VSo let's do that.
p238
aVSo on this bit of grassland, we'll do it, but just in the foreground.
p239
aVWe'll impact it very heavily with cattle to mimic nature,
p240
aVand we've done so, and look at that.
p241
aVAll of that grass is now covering the soil
p242
aVas dung, urine and litter or mulch,
p243
aVas every one of the gardeners amongst you would understand,
p244
aVand that soil is ready to absorb and hold the rain,
p245
aVto store carbon, and to break down methane.
p246
aVAnd we did that,
p247
aVwithout using fire to damage the soil,
p248
aVand the plants are free to grow.
p249
aa(lp250
VWhen I first realized
p251
aVthat we had no option as scientists
p252
aVbut to use much-vilified livestock
p253
aVto address climate change and desertification,
p254
aVI was faced with a real dilemma.
p255
aVHow were we to do it?
p256
aVWe'd had 10,000 years of extremely knowledgeable pastoralists
p257
aVbunching and moving their animals,
p258
aVbut they had created the great manmade deserts of the world.
p259
aVThen we'd had 100 years of modern rain science,
p260
aVand that had accelerated desertification,
p261
aVas we first discovered in Africa
p262
aVand then confirmed in the United States,
p263
aVand as you see in this picture
p264
aVof land managed by the federal government.
p265
aVClearly more was needed
p266
aVthan bunching and moving the animals,
p267
aVand humans, over thousands of years,
p268
aVhad never been able to deal with nature's complexity.
p269
aVBut we biologists and ecologists
p270
aVhad never tackled anything as complex as this.
p271
aVSo rather than reinvent the wheel,
p272
aVI began studying other professions to see if anybody had.
p273
aVAnd I found there were planning techniques
p274
aVthat I could take and adapt to our biological need,
p275
aVand from those I developed what we call
p276
aVholistic management and planned grazing,
p277
aVa planning process,
p278
aVand that does address all of nature's complexity
p279
aVand our social, environmental, economic complexity.
p280
aa(lp281
VToday, we have young women like this one
p282
aVteaching villages in Africa
p283
aVhow to put their animals together into larger herds,
p284
aVplan their grazing to mimic nature,
p285
aVand where we have them hold their animals overnight \u2014
p286
aVwe run them in a predator-friendly manner,
p287
aVbecause we have a lot of lands, and so on \u2014
p288
aVand where they do this and hold them overnight
p289
aVto prepare the crop fields,
p290
aVwe are getting very great increases in crop yield as well.
p291
aa(lp292
VLet's look at some results.
p293
aVThis is land close to land that we manage in Zimbabwe.
p294
aVIt has just come through four months of very good rains
p295
aVit got that year, and it's going into the long dry season.
p296
aVBut as you can see, all of that rain, almost of all it,
p297
aVhas evaporated from the soil surface.
p298
aVTheir river is dry despite the rain just having ended,
p299
aVand we have 150,000 people
p300
aVon almost permanent food aid.
p301
aVNow let's go to our land nearby on the same day,
p302
aVwith the same rainfall, and look at that.
p303
aVOur river is flowing and healthy and clean.
p304
aVIt's fine.
p305
aVThe production of grass, shrubs, trees, wildlife,
p306
aVeverything is now more productive,
p307
aVand we have virtually no fear of dry years.
p308
aVAnd we did that by increasing the cattle and goats
p309
aV400 percent,
p310
aVplanning the grazing to mimic nature
p311
aVand integrate them with all the elephants, buffalo,
p312
aVgiraffe and other animals that we have.
p313
aVBut before we began, our land looked like that.
p314
aVThis site was bare and eroding for over 30 years
p315
aVregardless of what rain we got.
p316
aVOkay? Watch the marked tree and see the change
p317
aVas we use livestock to mimic nature.
p318
aVThis was another site
p319
aVwhere it had been bare and eroding,
p320
aVand at the base of the marked small tree,
p321
aVwe had lost over 30 centimeters of soil. Okay?
p322
aVAnd again, watch the change
p323
aVjust using livestock to mimic nature.
p324
aVAnd there are fallen trees in there now,
p325
aVbecause the better land is now attracting elephants, etc.
p326
aVThis land in Mexico was in terrible condition,
p327
aVand I've had to mark the hill
p328
aVbecause the change is so profound.
p329
aa(lp330
V(Applause)
p331
aa(lp332
VI began helping a family in the Karoo Desert in the 1970s
p333
aVturn the desert that you see on the right there
p334
aVback to grassland,
p335
aVand thankfully, now their grandchildren are on the land
p336
aVwith hope for the future.
p337
aVAnd look at the amazing change in this one,
p338
aVwhere that gully has completely healed
p339
aVusing nothing but livestock mimicking nature,
p340
aVand once more, we have the third generation of that family
p341
aVon that land with their flag still flying.
p342
aa(lp343
VThe vast grasslands of Patagonia
p344
aVare turning to desert as you see here.
p345
aVThe man in the middle is an Argentinian researcher,
p346
aVand he has documented the steady decline of that land
p347
aVover the years as they kept reducing sheep numbers.
p348
aVThey put 25,000 sheep in one flock,
p349
aVreally mimicking nature now with planned grazing,
p350
aVand they have documented a 50-percent increase
p351
aVin the production of the land in the first year.
p352
aa(lp353
VWe now have in the violent Horn of Africa
p354
aVpastoralists planning their grazing to mimic nature
p355
aVand openly saying it is the only hope they have
p356
aVof saving their families and saving their culture.
p357
aVNinety-five percent of that land
p358
aVcan only feed people from animals.
p359
aa(lp360
VI remind you that I am talking about
p361
aVmost of the world's land here that controls our fate,
p362
aVincluding the most violent region of the world,
p363
aVwhere only animals can feed people
p364
aVfrom about 95 percent of the land.
p365
aVWhat we are doing globally is causing climate change
p366
aVas much as, I believe, fossil fuels,
p367
aVand maybe more than fossil fuels.
p368
aVBut worse than that, it is causing hunger, poverty,
p369
aVviolence, social breakdown and war,
p370
aVand as I am talking to you,
p371
aVmillions of men, women and children
p372
aVare suffering and dying.
p373
aVAnd if this continues,
p374
aVwe are unlikely to be able to stop the climate changing,
p375
aVeven after we have eliminated the use of fossil fuels.
p376
aa(lp377
VI believe I've shown you how we can work with nature
p378
aVat very low cost
p379
aVto reverse all this.
p380
aVWe are already doing so
p381
aVon about 15 million hectares
p382
aVon five continents,
p383
aVand people who understand
p384
aVfar more about carbon than I do
p385
aVcalculate that, for illustrative purposes,
p386
aVif we do what I am showing you here,
p387
aVwe can take enough carbon out of the atmosphere
p388
aVand safely store it in the grassland soils
p389
aVfor thousands of years,
p390
aVand if we just do that on about half the world's grasslands
p391
aVthat I've shown you,
p392
aVwe can take us back to pre-industrial levels,
p393
aVwhile feeding people.
p394
aVI can think of almost nothing
p395
aVthat offers more hope for our planet,
p396
aVfor your children,
p397
aVand their children, and all of humanity.
p398

p407
aVand I'm sure everyone here has,
p408
aVA) a hundred questions, B) wants to hug you.
p409
aVI'm just going to ask you one quick question.
p410
aVWhen you first start this and you bring in a flock of animals,
p411
aVit's desert. What do they eat? How does that part work?
p412
aVHow do you start?
p413
aa(lp414
VAllan Savory: Well, we have done this for a long time,
p415
aVand the only time we have ever had to provide any feed
p416
aVis during mine reclamation,
p417
aVwhere it's 100 percent bare.
p418
aVBut many years ago, we took the worst land in Zimbabwe,
p419
aVwhere I offered a £5 note
p420
aVin a hundred-mile drive
p421
aVif somebody could find one grass
p422
aVin a hundred-mile drive,
p423
aVand on that, we trebled the stocking rate,
p424
aVthe number of animals, in the first year with no feeding,
p425
aVjust by the movement, mimicking nature,
p426
aVand using a sigmoid curve, that principle.
p427
aVIt's a little bit technical to explain here, but just that.
p428
aa(lp429
VCA: Well, I would love to \u2014 I mean, this such an interesting and important idea.
