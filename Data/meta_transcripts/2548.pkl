VSo this is my niece.
p4
aVHer name is Yahli.
p5
aVShe is nine months old.
p6
aVHer mum is a doctor, and her dad is a lawyer.
p7
aVBy the time Yahli goes to college,
p8
aVthe jobs her parents do are going to look dramatically different.

aa(lp10
VIn 2013, researchers at Oxford University did a study on the future of work.
p11
aVThey concluded that almost one in every two jobs have a high risk
p12
aVof being automated by machines.
p13
aVMachine learning is the technology
p14
aVthat's responsible for most of this disruption.
p15
aVIt's the most powerful branch of artificial intelligence.
p16
aVIt allows machines to learn from data
p17
aVand mimic some of the things that humans can do.
p18
aVMy company, Kaggle, operates on the cutting edge of machine learning.
p19
aVWe bring together hundreds of thousands of experts
p20
aVto solve important problems for industry and academia.
p21
aVThis gives us a unique perspective on what machines can do,
p22
aVwhat they can't do
p23
aVand what jobs they might automate or threaten.
p24
aa(lp25
VMachine learning started making its way into industry in the early '90s.
p26
aVIt started with relatively simple tasks.
p27
aVIt started with things like assessing credit risk from loan applications,
p28
aVsorting the mail by reading handwritten characters from zip codes.
p29
aVOver the past few years, we have made dramatic breakthroughs.
p30
aVMachine learning is now capable of far, far more complex tasks.
p31
aVIn 2012, Kaggle challenged its community
p32
aVto build an algorithm that could grade high-school essays.
p33
aVThe winning algorithms were able to match the grades
p34
aVgiven by human teachers.
p35
aVLast year, we issued an even more difficult challenge.
p36
aVCan you take images of the eye and diagnose an eye disease
p37
aVcalled diabetic retinopathy?
p38
aVAgain, the winning algorithms were able to match the diagnoses
p39
aVgiven by human ophthalmologists.
p40
aa(lp41
VNow, given the right data, machines are going to outperform humans
p42
aVat tasks like this.
p43
aVA teacher might read 10,000 essays over a 40-year career.
p44
aVAn ophthalmologist might see 50,000 eyes.
p45
aVA machine can read millions of essays or see millions of eyes
p46
aVwithin minutes.
p47
aVWe have no chance of competing against machines
p48
aVon frequent, high-volume tasks.
p49
aa(lp50
VBut there are things we can do that machines can't do.
p51
aVWhere machines have made very little progress
p52
aVis in tackling novel situations.
p53
aVThey can't handle things they haven't seen many times before.
p54
aVThe fundamental limitations of machine learning
p55
aVis that it needs to learn from large volumes of past data.
p56
aVNow, humans don't.
p57
aVWe have the ability to connect seemingly disparate threads
p58
aVto solve problems we've never seen before.
p59
aa(lp60
VPercy Spencer was a physicist working on radar during World War II,
p61
aVwhen he noticed the magnetron was melting his chocolate bar.
p62
aVHe was able to connect his understanding of electromagnetic radiation
p63
aVwith his knowledge of cooking
p64
aVin order to invent \u2014 any guesses? \u2014 the microwave oven.
p65
aa(lp66
VNow, this is a particularly remarkable example of creativity.
p67
aVBut this sort of cross-pollination happens for each of us in small ways
p68
aVthousands of times per day.
p69
aVMachines cannot compete with us
p70
aVwhen it comes to tackling novel situations,
p71
aVand this puts a fundamental limit on the human tasks
p72
aVthat machines will automate.
p73
aa(lp74
VSo what does this mean for the future of work?
p75
aVThe future state of any single job lies in the answer to a single question:
p76
aVTo what extent is that job reducible to frequent, high-volume tasks,
p77
aVand to what extent does it involve tackling novel situations?
p78
aVOn frequent, high-volume tasks, machines are getting smarter and smarter.
p79
aVToday they grade essays. They diagnose certain diseases.
p80
aVOver coming years, they're going to conduct our audits,
p81
aVand they're going to read boilerplate from legal contracts.
p82
aVAccountants and lawyers are still needed.
p83
aVThey're going to be needed for complex tax structuring,
p84
aVfor pathbreaking litigation.
p85
aVBut machines will shrink their ranks
p86
aVand make these jobs harder to come by.
p87
aa(lp88
VNow, as mentioned,
p89
aVmachines are not making progress on novel situations.
p90
aVThe copy behind a marketing campaign needs to grab consumers' attention.
p91
aVIt has to stand out from the crowd.
p92
aVBusiness strategy means finding gaps in the market,
p93
aVthings that nobody else is doing.
p94
aVIt will be humans that are creating the copy behind our marketing campaigns,
p95
aVand it will be humans that are developing our business strategy.
p96
aa(lp97
VSo Yahli, whatever you decide to do,
p98
aVlet every day bring you a new challenge.
p99
aVIf it does, then you will stay ahead of the machines.
p100
aa(lp101
VThank you.
