VSo last year, on the Fourth of July,
p4
aVexperiments at the Large Hadron Collider
p5
aVdiscovered the Higgs boson.
p6
aVIt was a historical day.
p7
aVThere's no doubt that from now on,
p8
aVthe Fourth of July will be remembered
p9
aVnot as the day of the Declaration of Independence,
p10
aVbut as the day of the discovery of the Higgs boson.
p11
aVWell, at least, here at CERN.
p12
aa(lp13
VBut for me, the biggest surprise of that day
p14
aVwas that there was no big surprise.
p15
aVIn the eye of a theoretical physicist,
p16
aVthe Higgs boson is a clever explanation
p17
aVof how some elementary particles gain mass,
p18
aVbut it seems a fairly unsatisfactory
p19
aVand incomplete solution.
p20
aVToo many questions are left unanswered.
p21
aVThe Higgs boson does not share the beauty,
p22
aVthe symmetry, the elegance,
p23
aVof the rest of the elementary particle world.
p24
aVFor this reason, the majority of theoretical physicists
p25
aVbelieve that the Higgs boson could not
p26
aVbe the full story.
p27
aVWe were expecting new particles and new phenomena
p28
aVaccompanying the Higgs boson.
p29
aVInstead, so far, the measurements
p30
aVcoming from the LHC show no signs of new particles
p31
aVor unexpected phenomena.
p32
aa(lp33
VOf course, the verdict is not definitive.
p34
aVIn 2015, the LHC will almost double
p35
aVthe energy of the colliding protons,
p36
aVand these more powerful collisions
p37
aVwill allow us to explore further the particle world,
p38
aVand we will certainly learn much more.
p39
aa(lp40
VBut for the moment, since we have found
p41
aVno evidence for new phenomena, let us suppose
p42
aVthat the particles that we know today,
p43
aVincluding the Higgs boson,
p44
aVare the only elementary particles in nature,
p45
aVeven at energies much larger
p46
aVthan what we have explored so far.
p47
aVLet's see where this hypothesis is going to lead us.
p48
aVWe will find a surprising and intriguing result
p49
aVabout our universe, and to explain my point,
p50
aVlet me first tell you what the Higgs is about,
p51
aVand to do so, we have to go back
p52
aVto one tenth of a billionth of a second
p53
aVafter the Big Bang.
p54
aVAnd according to the Higgs theory,
p55
aVat that instant, a dramatic event took place
p56
aVin the universe.
p57
aVSpace-time underwent a phase transition.
p58
aVIt was something very similar to the phase transition
p59
aVthat occurs when water turns into ice
p60
aVbelow zero degrees.
p61
aVBut in our case, the phase transition
p62
aVis not a change in the way the molecules
p63
aVare arranged inside the material,
p64
aVbut is about a change
p65
aVof the very fabric of space-time.
p66
aa(lp67
VDuring this phase transition, empty space
p68
aVbecame filled with a substance
p69
aVthat we now call Higgs field.
p70
aVAnd this substance may seem invisible to us,
p71
aVbut it has a physical reality.
p72
aVIt surrounds us all the time,
p73
aVjust like the air we breathe in this room.
p74
aVAnd some elementary particles interact
p75
aVwith this substance, gaining energy in the process.
p76
aVAnd this intrinsic energy is what we call
p77
aVthe mass of a particle,
p78
aVand by discovering the Higgs boson, the LHC
p79
aVhas conclusively proved that this substance is real,
p80
aVbecause it is the stuff the Higgs bosons are made of.
p81
aVAnd this, in a nutshell, is the essence of the Higgs story.
p82
aa(lp83
VBut this story is far more interesting than that.
p84
aVBy studying the Higgs theory,
p85
aVtheoretical physicists discovered,
p86
aVnot through an experiment
p87
aVbut with the power of mathematics,
p88
aVthat the Higgs field does not necessarily exist
p89
aVonly in the form that we observe today.
p90
aVJust like matter can exist as liquid or solid,
p91
aVso the Higgs field, the substance that fills all space-time,
p92
aVcould exist in two states.
p93
aVBesides the known Higgs state,
p94
aVthere could be a second state in which the Higgs field
p95
aVis billions and billions times denser
p96
aVthan what we observe today,
p97
aVand the mere existence of another state
p98
aVof the Higgs field poses a potential problem.
p99
aVThis is because, according to the laws
p100
aVof quantum mechanics, it is possible
p101
aVto have transitions between two states,
p102
aVeven in the presence of an energy barrier
p103
aVseparating the two states,
p104
aVand the phenomenon is called,
p105
aVquite appropriately, quantum tunneling.
p106
aVBecause of quantum tunneling,
p107
aVI could disappear from this room
p108
aVand reappear in the next room,
p109
aVpractically penetrating the wall.
p110
aVBut don't expect me to actually perform the trick
p111
aVin front of your eyes, because the probability
p112
aVfor me to penetrate the wall is ridiculously small.
p113
aVYou would have to wait a really long time
p114
aVbefore it happens, but believe me,
p115
aVquantum tunneling is a real phenomenon,
p116
aVand it has been observed in many systems.
p117
aVFor instance, the tunnel diode,
p118
aVa component used in electronics,
p119
aVworks thanks to the wonders
p120
aVof quantum tunneling.
p121
aa(lp122
VBut let's go back to the Higgs field.
p123
aVIf the ultra-dense Higgs state existed,
p124
aVthen, because of quantum tunneling,
p125
aVa bubble of this state could suddenly appear
p126
aVin a certain place of the universe at a certain time,
p127
aVand it is analogous to what happens when you boil water.
p128
aVBubbles of vapor form inside the water,
p129
aVthen they expand, turning liquid into gas.
p130
aVIn the same way, a bubble of the ultra-dense Higgs state
p131
aVcould come into existence because of quantum tunneling.
p132
aVThe bubble would then expand at the speed of light,
p133
aVinvading all space, and turning the Higgs field
p134
aVfrom the familiar state into a new state.
p135
aa(lp136
VIs this a problem? Yes, it's a big a problem.
p137
aVWe may not realize it in ordinary life,
p138
aVbut the intensity of the Higgs field is critical
p139
aVfor the structure of matter.
p140
aVIf the Higgs field were only a few times more intense,
p141
aVwe would see atoms shrinking, neutrons decaying
p142
aVinside atomic nuclei, nuclei disintegrating,
p143
aVand hydrogen would be
p144
aVthe only possible chemical element in the universe.
p145
aVAnd the Higgs field, in the ultra-dense Higgs state,
p146
aVis not just a few times more intense than today,
p147
aVbut billions of times,
p148
aVand if space-time were filled by this Higgs state,
p149
aVall atomic matter would collapse.
p150
aVNo molecular structures would be possible, no life.
p151
aa(lp152
VSo, I wonder, is it possible
p153
aVthat in the future, the Higgs field
p154
aVwill undergo a phase transition and,
p155
aVthrough quantum tunneling, will be transformed
p156
aVinto this nasty, ultra-dense state?
p157
aVIn other words, I ask myself, what is the fate
p158
aVof the Higgs field in our universe?
p159
aVAnd the crucial ingredient necessary
p160
aVto answer this question is the Higgs boson mass.
p161
aVAnd experiments at the LHC found that the mass
p162
aVof the Higgs boson is about 126 GeV.
p163
aVThis is tiny when expressed in familiar units,
p164
aVbecause it's equal to something like
p165
aV10 to the minus 22 grams,
p166
aVbut it is large in particle physics units,
p167
aVbecause it is equal to the weight
p168
aVof an entire molecule
p169
aVof a DNA constituent.
p170
aa(lp171
VSo armed with this information from the LHC,
p172
aVtogether with some colleagues here at CERN,
p173
aVwe computed the probability
p174
aVthat our universe could quantum tunnel
p175
aVinto the ultra-dense Higgs state,
p176
aVand we found a very intriguing result.
p177
aVOur calculations showed
p178
aVthat the measured value of the Higgs boson mass
p179
aVis very special.
p180
aVIt has just the right value
p181
aVto keep the universe hanging
p182
aVin an unstable situation.
p183
aVThe Higgs field is in a wobbly configuration
p184
aVthat has lasted so far
p185
aVbut that will eventually collapse.
p186
aVSo according to these calculations,
p187
aVwe are like campers
p188
aVwho accidentally set their tent
p189
aVat the edge of a cliff.
p190
aVAnd eventually, the Higgs field
p191
aVwill undergo a phase transition
p192
aVand matter will collapse into itself.
p193
aa(lp194
VSo is this how humanity is going to disappear?
p195
aVI don't think so.
p196
aVOur calculation shows that quantum tunneling
p197
aVof the Higgs field is not likely to occur
p198
aVin the next 10 to the 100 years,
p199
aVand this is a very long time.
p200
aVIt's even longer than
p201
aVthe time it takes for Italy to form a stable government.
p202
aa(lp203
V(Laughter)
p204
aa(lp205
VEven so, we will be long gone by then.
p206
aVIn about five billion years,
p207
aVour sun will become a red giant,
p208
aVas large as the Earth's orbit,
p209
aVand our Earth will be kaput,
p210
aVand in a thousand billion years,
p211
aVif dark energy keeps on fueling
p212
aVspace expansion at the present rate,
p213
aVyou will not even be able to see as far as your toes,
p214
aVbecause everything around you
p215
aVexpands at a rate faster than the speed of light.
p216
aVSo it is really unlikely
p217
aVthat we will be around to see the Higgs field collapse.
p218
aa(lp219
VBut the reason why I am interested
p220
aVin the transition of the Higgs field
p221
aVis because I want to address the question,
p222
aVwhy is the Higgs boson mass so special?
p223
aVWhy is it just right to keep the universe
p224
aVat the edge of a phase transition?
p225
aVTheoretical physicists always ask "why" questions.
p226
aVMore than how a phenomenon works,
p227
aVtheoretical physicists are always interested in
p228
aVwhy a phenomenon works in the way it works.
p229
aVWe think that this these "why" questions
p230
aVcan give us clues
p231
aVabout the fundamental principles of nature.
p232
aVAnd indeed, a possible answer to my question
p233
aVopens up new universes, literally.
p234
aVIt has been speculated that our universe
p235
aVis only a bubble in a soapy multiverse
p236
aVmade out of a multitude of bubbles,
p237
aVand each bubble is a different universe
p238
aVwith different fundamental constants
p239
aVand different physical laws.
p240
aVAnd in this context, you can only talk about
p241
aVthe probability of finding a certain value of the Higgs mass.
p242
aVThen the key to the mystery
p243
aVcould lie in the statistical properties
p244
aVof the multiverse.
p245
aVIt would be something like what happens
p246
aVwith sand dunes on a beach.
p247
aVIn principle, you could imagine to find sand dunes
p248
aVof any slope angle in a beach,
p249
aVand yet, the slope angles of sand dunes
p250
aVare typically around 30, 35 degrees.
p251
aVAnd the reason is simple:
p252
aVbecause wind builds up the sand, gravity makes it fall.
p253
aVAs a result, the vast majority of sand dunes
p254
aVhave slope angles around the critical value,
p255
aVnear to collapse.
p256
aVAnd something similar could happen
p257
aVfor the Higgs boson mass in the multiverse.
p258
aVIn the majority of bubble universes,
p259
aVthe Higgs mass could be around the critical value,
p260
aVnear to a cosmic collapse of the Higgs field,
p261
aVbecause of two competing effects,
p262
aVjust as in the case of sand.
p263
aa(lp264
VMy story does not have an end,
p265
aVbecause we still don't know the end of the story.
p266
aVThis is science in progress,
p267
aVand to solve the mystery, we need more data,
p268
aVand hopefully, the LHC will soon add new clues
p269
aVto this story.
p270
aVJust one number, the Higgs boson mass,
p271
aVand yet, out of this number we learn so much.
p272
aVI started from a hypothesis, that the known particles
p273
aVare all there is in the universe,
p274
aVeven beyond the domain explored so far.
p275
aVFrom this, we discovered that the Higgs field
p276
aVthat permeates space-time may be standing
p277
aVon a knife edge, ready for cosmic collapse,
p278
aVand we discovered that this may be a hint
p279
aVthat our universe is only a grain of sand
p280
aVin a giant beach, the multiverse.
p281
aa(lp282
VBut I don't know if my hypothesis is right.
p283
aVThat's how physics works: A single measurement
p284
aVcan put us on the road to a new understanding
p285
aVof the universe
p286
aVor it can send us down a blind alley.
p287
aVBut whichever it turns out to be,
p288
aVthere is one thing I'm sure of:
p289
aVThe journey will be full of surprises.
