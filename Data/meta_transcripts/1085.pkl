VTwo weeks ago I was in my studio in Paris,
p4
aVand the phone rang and I heard,
p5
aV"Hey, JR,
p6
aVyou won the TED Prize 2011.
p7
aVYou have to make a wish to save the world."
p8
aVI was lost.
p9
aVI mean, I can't save the world. Nobody can.
p10
aVThe world is fucked up.
p11
aVCome on, you have dictators ruling the world,
p12
aVpopulation is growing by millions,
p13
aVthere's no more fish in the sea,
p14
aVthe North Pole is melting
p15
aVand as the last TED Prize winner said,
p16
aVwe're all becoming fat.
p17
aV(Laughter)
p18
aVExcept maybe French people.
p19
aVWhatever.
p20
aVSo I called back
p21
aVand I told her,
p22
aV"Look, Amy,
p23
aVtell the TED guys I just won't show up.
p24
aVI can't do anything to save the world."
p25
aVShe said, "Hey, JR,
p26
aVyour wish is not to save the world, but to change the world."
p27
aV"Oh, all right."
p28
aV(Laughter)
p29
aV"That's cool."
p30
aVI mean, technology, politics, business
p31
aVdo change the world \u2014
p32
aVnot always in a good way, but they do.
p33
aVWhat about art?
p34
aVCould art change the world?
p35
aa(lp36
VI started when I was 15 years old.
p37
aVAnd at that time, I was not thinking about changing the world.
p38
aVI was doing graffiti \u2014
p39
aVwriting my name everywhere,
p40
aVusing the city as a canvas.
p41
aVI was going in the tunnels of Paris,
p42
aVon the rooftops with my friends.
p43
aVEach trip was an excursion,
p44
aVwas an adventure.
p45
aVIt was like leaving our mark on society,
p46
aVto say, "I was here," on the top of a building.
p47
aa(lp48
VSo when I found a cheap camera on the subway,
p49
aVI started documenting those adventures with my friends
p50
aVand gave them back as photocopies \u2014
p51
aVreally small photos just that size.
p52
aVThat's how, at 17 years old,
p53
aVI started pasting them.
p54
aVAnd I did my first "expo de rue,"
p55
aVwhich means sidewalk gallery.
p56
aVAnd I framed it with color
p57
aVso you would not confuse it with advertising.
p58
aVI mean, the city's the best gallery I could imagine.
p59
aVI would never have to make a book and then present it to a gallery
p60
aVand let them decide
p61
aVif my work was nice enough to show it to people.
p62
aVI would control it directly with the public
p63
aVin the streets.
p64
aa(lp65
VSo that's Paris.
p66
aVI would change \u2014
p67
aVdepending on the places I would go \u2014
p68
aVthe title of the exhibition.
p69
aVThat's on the Champs-Elysees.
p70
aVI was quite proud of that one.
p71
aVBecause I was just 18
p72
aVand I was just up there on the top of the Champs-Elysees.
p73
aVThen when the photo left,
p74
aVthe frame was still there.
p75
aa(lp76
V(Laughter)
p77
aa(lp78
VNovember 2005:
p79
aVthe streets are burning.
p80
aVA large wave of riots
p81
aVhad broken into the first projects of Paris.
p82
aVEveryone was glued to the TV,
p83
aVwatching disturbing, frightening images
p84
aVtaken from the edge of the neighborhood.
p85
aVI mean, these kids, without control,
p86
aVthrowing Molotov cocktails,
p87
aVattacking the cops and the firemen,
p88
aVlooting everything they could in the shops.
p89
aVThese were criminals, thugs, dangerous,
p90
aVdestroying their own environment.
p91
aa(lp92
VAnd then I saw it \u2014 could it be possible? \u2014
p93
aVmy photo on a wall
p94
aVrevealed by a burning car \u2014
p95
aVa pasting I'd done a year earlier \u2014
p96
aVan illegal one \u2014 still there.
p97
aVI mean, these were the faces of my friends.
p98
aVI know those guys.
p99
aVAll of them are not angels,
p100
aVbut they're not monsters either.
p101
aVSo it was kind of weird to see
p102
aVthose images and those eyes stare back at me through a television.
p103
aa(lp104
VSo I went back there
p105
aVwith a 28 mm lens.
p106
aVIt was the only one I had at that time.
p107
aVBut with that lens,
p108
aVyou have to be as close as 10 inches from the person.
p109
aVSo you can do it only with their trust.
p110
aVSo I took full portraits of people from Le Bosquet.
p111
aVThey were making scary faces
p112
aVto play the caricature of themselves.
p113
aVAnd then I pasted huge posters everywhere
p114
aVin the bourgeois area of Paris
p115
aVwith the name, age, even building number
p116
aVof these guys.
p117
aVA year later,
p118
aVthe exhibition was displayed in front of the city hall of Paris.
p119
aVAnd we go from thug images,
p120
aVwho've been stolen and distorted by the media,
p121
aVwho's now proudly taking over his own image.
p122
aVThat's where I realized
p123
aVthe power of paper and glue.
p124
aVSo could art change the world?
p125
aa(lp126
VA year later,
p127
aVI was listening to all the noise
p128
aVabout the Middle East conflict.
p129
aVI mean, at that time, trust me,
p130
aVthey were only referring to the Israeli and Palestinian conflict.
p131
aVSo with my friend Marco,
p132
aVwe decided to go there
p133
aVand see who are the real Palestinians and who are the real Israelis.
p134
aVAre they so different?
p135
aVWhen we got there, we just went in the street,
p136
aVstarted talking with people everywhere,
p137
aVand we realized that things were a bit different
p138
aVfrom the rhetoric we heard in the media.
p139
aVSo we decided to take portraits
p140
aVof Palestinians and Israelis
p141
aVdoing the same jobs \u2014
p142
aVtaxi-driver, lawyer, cooks.
p143
aVAsked them to make a face as a sign of commitment.
p144
aVNot a smile \u2014 that really doesn't tell
p145
aVabout who you are and what you feel.
p146
aVThey all accepted
p147
aVto be pasted next to the other.
p148
aVI decided to paste
p149
aVin eight Israeli and Palestinian cities
p150
aVand on both sides of the wall.
p151
aVWe launched the biggest illegal art exhibition ever.
p152
aVWe called the project Face 2 Face.
p153
aa(lp154
VThe experts said, "No way.
p155
aVThe people will not accept.
p156
aVThe army will shoot you, and Hamas will kidnap you."
p157
aVWe said, "Okay, let's try and push as far as we can."
p158
aVI love the way that people will ask me,
p159
aV"How big will my photo be?"
p160
aV"It will be as big as your house."
p161
aVWhen we did the wall, we did the Palestinian side.
p162
aVSo we arrived with just our ladders
p163
aVand we realized that they were not high enough.
p164
aVAnd so Palestinians guys say,
p165
aV"Calm down. No wait. I'm going to find you a solution."
p166
aVSo he went to the Church of Nativity
p167
aVand brought back an old ladder
p168
aVthat was so old that it could have seen Jesus being born.
p169
aV(Laughter)
p170
aVWe did Face 2 Face with only six friends,
p171
aVtwo ladders, two brushes,
p172
aVa rented car, a camera
p173
aVand 20,000 square feet of paper.
p174
aVWe had all sorts of help
p175
aVfrom all walks of life.
p176
aa(lp177
VOkay, for example, that's Palestine.
p178
aVWe're in Ramallah right now.
p179
aVWe're pasting portraits \u2014
p180
aVso both portraits in the streets in a crowded market.
p181
aVPeople come around us and start asking,
p182
aV"What are you doing here?"
p183
aV"Oh, we're actually doing an art project
p184
aVand we are pasting an Israeli and a Palestinian doing the same job.
p185
aVAnd those ones are actually two taxi-drivers."
p186
aVAnd then there was always a silence.
p187
aV"You mean you're pasting an Israeli face \u2014
p188
aVdoing a face \u2014 right here?"
p189
aV"Well, yeah, yeah, that's part of the project."
p190
aVAnd I would always leave that moment,
p191
aVand we would ask them,
p192
aV"So can you tell me who is who?"
p193
aVAnd most of them couldn't say.
p194
aa(lp195
V(Applause)
p196
aa(lp197
VWe even pasted on Israeli military towers,
p198
aVand nothing happened.
p199
aVWhen you paste an image, it's just paper and glue.
p200
aVPeople can tear it, tag on it, or even pee on it \u2014
p201
aVsome are a bit high for that, I agree \u2014
p202
aVbut the people in the street,
p203
aVthey are the curator.
p204
aVThe rain and the wind will take them off anyway.
p205
aVThey are not meant to stay.
p206
aVBut exactly four years after,
p207
aVthe photos, most of them are still there.
p208
aVFace 2 Face demonstrated
p209
aVthat what we thought impossible was possible \u2014
p210
aVand, you know what, even easy.
p211
aVWe didn't push the limit;
p212
aVwe just showed that they were further than anyone thought.
p213
aa(lp214
VIn the Middle East, I experienced my work
p215
aVin places without [many] museums.
p216
aVSo the reactions in the street
p217
aVwere kind of interesting.
p218
aVSo I decided to go further in this direction
p219
aVand go in places where there were zero museums.
p220
aVWhen you go in these developing societies,
p221
aVwomen are the pillars of their community,
p222
aVbut the men are still the ones holding the streets.
p223
aVSo we were inspired to create a project
p224
aVwhere men will pay tribute to women
p225
aVby posting their photos.
p226
aVI called that project Women Are Heroes.
p227
aVWhen I listened to all the stories
p228
aVeverywhere I went on the continents,
p229
aVI couldn't always understand
p230
aVthe complicated circumstances of their conflict.
p231
aVI just observed.
p232
aVSometimes there was no words,
p233
aVno sentence, just tears.
p234
aVI just took their pictures
p235
aVand pasted them.
p236
aa(lp237
VWomen Are Heroes took me around the world.
p238
aVMost of the places I went to,
p239
aVI decided to go there
p240
aVbecause I've heard about it through the media.
p241
aVSo for example, in June 2008,
p242
aVI was watching TV in Paris,
p243
aVand then I heard about this terrible thing
p244
aVthat happened in Rio de Janeiro \u2014
p245
aVthe first favela of Brazil named Providencia.
p246
aVThree kids \u2014 that was three students \u2014
p247
aVwere [detained] by the army
p248
aVbecause they were not carrying their papers.
p249
aVAnd the army took them,
p250
aVand instead of bringing them to the police station,
p251
aVthey brought them to an enemy favela
p252
aVwhere they get chopped into pieces.
p253
aVI was shocked.
p254
aVAll Brazil was shocked.
p255
aVI heard it was one of the most violent favelas,
p256
aVbecause the largest drug cartel controls it.
p257
aVSo I decided to go there.
p258
aa(lp259
VWhen I arrived \u2014
p260
aVI mean, I didn't have any contact with any NGO.
p261
aVThere was none in place \u2014 no association, no NGOs, nothing \u2014
p262
aVno eyewitnesses.
p263
aVSo we just walked around,
p264
aVand we met a woman,
p265
aVand I showed her my book.
p266
aVAnd she said, "You know what?
p267
aVWe're hungry for culture.
p268
aVWe need culture out there."
p269
aVSo I went out and I started with the kids.
p270
aVI just took a few photos of the kids,
p271
aVand the next day I came with the posters and we pasted them.
p272
aVThe day after, I came back and they were already scratched.
p273
aVBut that's okay.
p274
aVI wanted them to feel that this art belongs to them.
p275
aa(lp276
VThen the next day, I held a meeting on the main square
p277
aVand some women came.
p278
aVThey were all linked to the three kids that got killed.
p279
aVThere was the mother, the grandmother, the best friend \u2014
p280
aVthey all wanted to shout the story.
p281
aVAfter that day,
p282
aVeveryone in the favela gave me the green light.
p283
aVI took more photos, and we started the project.
p284
aVThe drug lords were kind of worried
p285
aVabout us filming in the place,
p286
aVso I told them, "You know what?
p287
aVI'm not interested in filming the violence and the weapons.
p288
aVYou see that enough in the media.
p289
aVWhat I want to show is the incredible life and energy.
p290
aVI've been seeing it around me the last few days."
p291
aVSo that's a really symbolic pasting,
p292
aVbecause that's the first one we did that you couldn't see from the city.
p293
aVAnd that's where the three kids got arrested,
p294
aVand that's the grandmother of one of them.
p295
aVAnd on that stairs,
p296
aVthat's where the traffickers always stand
p297
aVand there's a lot of exchange of fire.
p298
aVEveryone there understood the project.
p299
aVAnd then we pasted everywhere \u2014 the whole hill.
p300
aa(lp301
V(Applause)
p302
aa(lp303
VWhat was interesting is that the media couldn't get in.
p304
aVI mean, you should see that.
p305
aVThey would have to film us from a really long distance by helicopter
p306
aVand then have a really long lens,
p307
aVand we would see ourselves, on TV, pasting.
p308
aVAnd they would put a number: "Please call this number
p309
aVif you know what's going on in Providencia."
p310
aVWe just did a project and then left
p311
aVso the media wouldn't know.
p312
aVSo how can we know about the project?
p313
aVSo they had to go and find the women
p314
aVand get an explanation from them.
p315
aVSo you create a bridge between the media
p316
aVand the anonymous women.
p317
aa(lp318
VWe kept traveling.
p319
aVWe went to Africa, Sudan, Sierra Leone,
p320
aVLiberia, Kenya.
p321
aVIn war-torn places like Monrovia,
p322
aVpeople come straight to you.
p323
aVI mean, they want to know what you're up to.
p324
aVThey kept asking me, "What is the purpose of your project?
p325
aVAre you an NGO? Are you the media?"
p326
aVArt. Just doing art.
p327
aVSome people question, "Why is it in black and white?
p328
aVDon't you have color in France?"
p329
aV(Laughter)
p330
aVOr they tell you, "Are these people all dead?"
p331
aVSome who understood the project would explain it to others.
p332
aVAnd to a man who did not understand, I heard someone say,
p333
aV"You know, you've been here for a few hours
p334
aVtrying to understand, discussing with your fellows.
p335
aVDuring that time, you haven't thought about
p336
aVwhat you're going to eat tomorrow.
p337
aVThis is art."
p338
aVI think it's people's curiosity
p339
aVthat motivates them
p340
aVto come into the projects.
p341
aVAnd then it becomes more.
p342
aVIt becomes a desire, a need, an armor.
p343
aVOn this bridge that's in Monrovia,
p344
aVex-rebel soldiers helped us pasting a portrait
p345
aVof a woman that might have been raped during the war.
p346
aVWomen are always the first ones targeted
p347
aVduring conflict.
p348
aa(lp349
VThis is Kibera, Kenya,
p350
aVone of the largest slums of Africa.
p351
aVYou might have seen images about the post-election violence
p352
aVthat happened there in 2008.
p353
aVThis time we covered the roofs of the houses,
p354
aVbut we didn't use paper,
p355
aVbecause paper doesn't prevent the rain
p356
aVfrom leaking inside the house \u2014
p357
aVvinyl does.
p358
aVThen art becomes useful.
p359
aVSo the people kept it.
p360
aVYou know what I love is, for example, when you see the biggest eye there,
p361
aVthere are so [many] houses inside.
p362
aVAnd I went there a few months ago \u2014
p363
aVphotos are still there \u2014 and it was missing a piece of the eye.
p364
aVSo I asked the people what happened.
p365
aV"Oh, that guy just moved."
p366
aV(Laughter)
p367
aVWhen the roofs were covered, a woman said as a joke,
p368
aV"Now God can see me."
p369
aVWhen you look at Kibera now,
p370
aVthey look back.
p371
aa(lp372
VOkay, India.
p373
aVBefore I start that, just so you know,
p374
aVeach time we go to a place, we don't have authorization,
p375
aVso we set up like commandos \u2014
p376
aVwe're a group of friends who arrive there,
p377
aVand we try to paste on the walls.
p378
aVBut there are places where you just can't paste on a wall.
p379
aVIn India it was just impossible to paste.
p380
aVI heard culturally and because of the law,
p381
aVthey would just arrest us at the first pasting.
p382
aVSo we decided to paste white,
p383
aVwhite on the walls.
p384
aVSo imagine white guys pasting white papers.
p385
aVSo people would come to us and ask us,
p386
aV"Hey, what are you up to?"
p387
aV"Oh, you know, we're just doing art." "Art?"
p388
aVOf course, they were confused.
p389
aVBut you know how India has a lot of dust in the streets,
p390
aVand the more dust you would have
p391
aVgoing up in the air,
p392
aVon the white paper you can almost see,
p393
aVbut there is this sticky part
p394
aVlike when you reverse a sticker.
p395
aVSo the more dust you have, the more it will reveal the photo.
p396
aVSo we could just walk in the street during the next days
p397
aVand the photos would get revealed by themselves.
p398
aV(Applause)
p399
aVThank you.
p400
aVSo we didn't get caught this time.
p401
aa(lp402
VEach project \u2014 that's a film
p403
aVfrom Women Are Heroes.
p404
aV(Music)
p405
aVOkay.
p406
aVFor each project we do
p407
aVa film.
p408
aVAnd most of what you see \u2014 that's a trailer from "Women Are Heroes" \u2014
p409
aVits images, photography,
p410
aVtaken one after the other.
p411
aVAnd the photos kept traveling even without us.
p412
aV(Laughter)
p413
aV(Applause)
p414
aVHopefully, you'll see the film,
p415
aVand you'll understand the scope of the project
p416
aVand what the people felt when they saw those photos.
p417
aVBecause that's a big part of it. There's layers behind each photo.
p418
aVBehind each image is a story.
p419
aa(lp420
VWomen Are Heroes created a new dynamic
p421
aVin each of the communities,
p422
aVand the women kept that dynamic after we left.
p423
aVFor example, we did books \u2014 not for sale \u2014
p424
aVthat all the community would get.
p425
aVBut to get it, they would have to [get] it signed by one of the women.
p426
aVWe did that in most of the places.
p427
aVWe go back regularly.
p428
aVAnd so in Providencia, for example, in the favela,
p429
aVwe have a cultural center running there.
p430
aVIn Kibera, each year we cover more roofs.
p431
aVBecause of course, when we left, the people who were just at the edge of the project
p432
aVsaid, "Hey, what about my roof?"
p433
aVSo we decided to come the year after
p434
aVand keep doing the project.
p435
aa(lp436
VA really important point for me
p437
aVis that I don't use any brand or corporate sponsors.
p438
aVSo I have no responsibility
p439
aVto anyone but myself
p440
aVand the subjects.
p441
aV(Applause)
p442
aVAnd that is for me
p443
aVone of the more important things in the work.
p444
aVI think, today,
p445
aVas important as the result is the way you do things.
p446
aVAnd that has always been a central part of the work.
p447
aVAnd what's interesting is that fine line that I have
p448
aVwith images and advertising.
p449
aVWe just did some pasting in Los Angeles
p450
aVon another project in the last weeks.
p451
aVAnd I was even invited to cover the MOCA museum.
p452
aVBut yesterday the city called them and said,
p453
aV"Look, you're going to have to tear it down.
p454
aVBecause this can be taken for advertising,
p455
aVand because of the law,
p456
aVit has to be taken down."
p457
aVBut tell me, advertising for what?
p458
aa(lp459
VThe people I photograph
p460
aVwere proud to participate in the project
p461
aVand to have their photo in the community.
p462
aVBut they asked me for a promise basically.
p463
aVThey asked me, "Please, make our story travel with you."
p464
aVSo I did. That's Paris.
p465
aVThat's Rio.
p466
aVIn each place, we built exhibitions with a story, and the story traveled.
p467
aVYou understand the full scope of the project.
p468
aVThat's London.
p469
aVNew York.
p470
aVAnd today, they are with you in Long Beach.
p471
aa(lp472
VAll right, recently I started a public art project
p473
aVwhere I don't use my artwork anymore.
p474
aVI use Man Ray, Helen Levitt,
p475
aVGiacomelli, other people's artwork.
p476
aVIt doesn't matter today if it's your photo or not.
p477
aVThe importance is what you do
p478
aVwith the images,
p479
aVthe statement it makes where it's pasted.
p480
aVSo for example, I pasted the photo of the minaret
p481
aVin Switzerland
p482
aVa few weeks after they voted the law forbidding minarets in the country.
p483
aV(Applause)
p484
aVThis image of three men wearing gas masks
p485
aVwas taken in Chernobyl originally,
p486
aVand I pasted it in Southern Italy,
p487
aVwhere the mafia sometimes bury the garbage under the ground.
p488
aa(lp489
VIn some ways, art can change the world.
p490
aVArt is not supposed to change the world,
p491
aVto change practical things,
p492
aVbut to change perceptions.
p493
aVArt can change
p494
aVthe way we see the world.
p495
aVArt can create an analogy.
p496
aVActually the fact that art cannot change things
p497
aVmakes it a neutral place
p498
aVfor exchanges and discussions,
p499
aVand then enables you to change the world.
p500
aVWhen I do my work,
p501
aVI have two kinds of reactions.
p502
aVPeople say, "Oh, why don't you go in Iraq or Afghanistan.
p503
aVThey would be really useful."
p504
aVOr, "How can we help?"
p505
aVI presume that you belong to the second category,
p506
aVand that's good,
p507
aVbecause for that project,
p508
aVI'm going to ask you to take the photos
p509
aVand paste them.
p510
aa(lp511
VSo now my wish is:
p512
aV(mock drum roll)
p513
aV(Laughter)
p514
aVI wish for you to stand up
p515
aVfor what you care about
p516
aVby participating in a global art project,
p517
aVand together we'll turn the world inside out.
p518
aVAnd this starts right now.
p519
aVYes, everyone in the room.
p520
aVEveryone watching.
p521
aVI wanted that wish
p522
aVto actually start now.
p523
aVSo a subject you're passionate about, a person who you want to tell their story
p524
aVor even your own photos \u2014
p525
aVtell me what you stand for.
p526
aVTake the photos, the portraits,
p527
aVupload it \u2014 I'll give you all the details \u2014
p528
aVand I'll send you back your poster. Join by groups
p529
aVand reveal things to the world.
p530
aVThe full data is on the website \u2014
p531
aVinsideoutproject.net \u2014
p532
aVthat is launching today.
p533
aa(lp534
VWhat we see changes who we are.
p535
aVWhen we act together,
p536
aVthe whole thing is much more than the sum of the parts.
p537
aVSo I hope that, together, we'll create something
p538
aVthat the world will remember.
p539
aVAnd this starts right now and depends on you.
p540
