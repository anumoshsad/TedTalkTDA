VI've come here today
p4
aVto talk to you about a problem.
p5
aVIt's a very simple yet devastating problem,
p6
aVone that spans the globe
p7
aVand is affecting all of us.
p8
aVThe problem is
p9
aVanonymous companies.
p10
aVIt sounds like a really dry and technical thing,
p11
aVdoesn't it?
p12
aVBut anonymous companies are making it difficult
p13
aVand sometimes impossible
p14
aVto find out
p15
aVthe actual human beings responsible
p16
aVsometimes for really terrible crimes.
p17
aVSo, why am I here talking to all of you?
p18
aVWell, I guess I am a lifelong troublemaker
p19
aVand when my parents taught my twin brother and I
p20
aVto question authority,
p21
aVI don't think they knew where it might lead.
p22
aV(Laughter)
p23
aVAnd, they probably really regretted it
p24
aVduring my stroppy teenage years when, predictably,
p25
aVI questioned their authority a lot.
p26
aVAnd a lot of my school teachers
p27
aVdidn't appreciate it much either.
p28
aVYou see, since the age of about five
p29
aVI've always asked the question, but why?
p30
aVBut why does the Earth go around the sun?
p31
aVBut why is blood red?
p32
aVBut why do I have to go to school?
p33
aVBut why do I have to respect the teachers
p34
aVand authority?
p35
aVAnd little did I realize
p36
aVthat this question would become the basis
p37
aVof everything I would do.
p38
aVAnd so it was
p39
aVin my twenties, a long time ago,
p40
aVthat one rainy Sunday afternoon in North London
p41
aVI was sitting with Simon Taylor
p42
aVand Patrick Alley
p43
aVand we were busy stuffing envelopes
p44
aVfor a mail out in the office of the campaign group
p45
aVwhere we worked at the time.
p46
aVAnd as usual, we were talking  about the world's problems.
p47
aVAnd in particular, we were talking about
p48
aVthe civil war in Cambodia.
p49
aVAnd we had talked about that  many, many times before.
p50
aVBut then suddenly we stopped
p51
aVand looked at each other
p52
aVand said, but why don't we try and change this?
p53
aVAnd from that slightly crazy question,
p54
aVover two decades
p55
aVand many campaigns later,
p56
aVincluding alerting the world
p57
aVto the problem of blood diamonds funding war,
p58
aVfrom that crazy question,
p59
aVGlobal Witness is now an 80-strong team
p60
aVof campaigners, investigators,  journalists and lawyers.
p61
aVAnd we're all driven by the same belief,
p62
aVthat change really is possible.
p63
aa(lp64
VSo, what exactly does Global Witness do?
p65
aVWe investigate, we report,
p66
aVto uncover the people really responsible
p67
aVfor funding conflict \u2014
p68
aVfor stealing millions from citizens around the world,
p69
aValso known as state looting,
p70
aVand for destroying the environment.
p71
aVAnd then we campaign hard to  change the system itself.
p72
aVAnd we're doing this because  so many of the countries
p73
aVrich in natural resources
p74
aVlike oil or diamonds or timber
p75
aVare home to some of the poorest
p76
aVand most dispossessed people on the planet.
p77
aVAnd much of this injustice
p78
aVis made possible
p79
aVby currently accepted business practices.
p80
aVAnd one of these is anonymous companies.
p81
aVNow we've come up against anonymous companies
p82
aVin lots of our investigations,
p83
aVlike in the Democratic Republic of Congo,
p84
aVwhere we exposed how secretive deals
p85
aVinvolving anonymous companies
p86
aVhad deprived the citizens
p87
aVof one of the poorest countries on the planet
p88
aVof well over a billion dollars.
p89
aVThat's twice the country's health  and education budget combined.
p90
aVOr in Liberia,
p91
aVwhere an international predatory logging company
p92
aVused front companies as it attempted to grab
p93
aVa really huge chunk of Liberia's unique forests.
p94
aVOr political corruption in Sarawak, Malaysia,
p95
aVwhich has led to the destruction  of much of its forests.
p96
aVWell, that uses anonymous companies too.
p97
aVWe secretly filmed some of the family
p98
aVof the former chief minister and a lawyer
p99
aVas they told our undercover investigator
p100
aVexactly how these dubious deals are done
p101
aVusing such companies.
p102
aVAnd the awful thing is,
p103
aVthere are so many other examples out there
p104
aVfrom all walks of life.
p105
aVThis truly is a scandal of epic proportions
p106
aVhidden in plain sight.
p107
aVWhether it's the ruthless Mexican drugs cartel,
p108
aVthe Zetas,
p109
aVwho use anonymous companies  to launder profits
p110
aVwhile their drugs-related violence
p111
aVis tearing communities apart across the Americas.
p112
aVOr the anonymous company,
p113
aVwhich bought up Americans' tax debts,
p114
aVpiled on the legal fees
p115
aVand then gave homeowners a choice:
p116
aVPay up or lose your home.
p117
aVImagine being threatened with losing your home
p118
aVsometimes over a debt of just a few hundred dollars,
p119
aVand not being able to find out
p120
aVwho you were really up against.
p121
aa(lp122
VNow anonymous companies
p123
aVare great for sanctions busting too.
p124
aVAs the Iranian government found out
p125
aVwhen, through a series of front companies,
p126
aVit owned a building in the very heart of Manhattan,
p127
aVon Fifth Avenue,
p128
aVdespite American sanctions.
p129
aVAnd Juicy Couture, home of of the velvet track suit,
p130
aVand other companies were the unwitting,
p131
aVunknowing tenants there.
p132
aVThere are just so many examples,
p133
aVthe horesemeat scandal in Europe,
p134
aVthe Italian mafia, they've used these companies
p135
aVfor decades.
p136
aVThe $100 million American Medicare fraud,
p137
aVthe supply of weapons to wars around the world
p138
aVincluding those
p139
aVin Eastern Europe in the early '90s.
p140
aVAnonymous companies
p141
aVhave even come to light
p142
aVin the recent revolution in the Ukraine.
p143
aa(lp144
VBut, for every case that we and others expose
p145
aVthere are so many more that will remain hidden away
p146
aVbecause of the current system.
p147
aVAnd it's just a simple truth
p148
aVthat some of the people responsible  for outrageous crimes,
p149
aVfor stealing from you and me
p150
aVand millions of others,
p151
aVthey are remaining faceless
p152
aVand they are escaping accountability
p153
aVand they're doing this with ease,
p154
aVand they're doing it using legal structures.
p155
aVAnd really, that is unfair.
p156
aVWell, you might well ask,
p157
aVwhat exactly is an anonymous company,
p158
aVand can I really set one up, and use it,
p159
aVwithout anyone knowing who I am?
p160
aVWell, the answer is, yes you can.
p161
aVBut if you're anything like me,
p162
aVyou'll want to see some of that for yourself,
p163
aVso let me show you.
p164
aVWell first you need to work out
p165
aVwhere you want to set it up.
p166
aVNow, at this point you might be imagining
p167
aVone of those lovely tropical island tax havens
p168
aVbut here's the thing,
p169
aVshockingly,
p170
aVmy own hometown, London,
p171
aVand indeed the U.K.,
p172
aVis one of the best places in the world
p173
aVto set up an anonymous company.
p174
aVAnd the other, even better,
p175
aVI'm afraid that's America.
p176
aVDo you know, in some states across America
p177
aVyou need less identification
p178
aVto open up a company
p179
aVthan you do to get a library card,
p180
aVlike Delaware,
p181
aVwhich is one of the easiest places
p182
aVin the world to set up an anonymous company.
p183
aa(lp184
VOkay, so let's say it's America,
p185
aVand let's say it's Delaware,
p186
aVand now you can simply go online
p187
aVand find yourself a company service provider.
p188
aVThese are the companies that  can set your one up for you,
p189
aVand remember, it's all legal, routine business practice.
p190
aVSo, here's one,
p191
aVbut there are plenty of others to choose from.
p192
aVAnd having made your choice,
p193
aVyou then pick what type of company you want
p194
aVand then fill in a contact, name and address.
p195
aVBut don't worry,
p196
aVit doesn't have to be your name.
p197
aVIt can be your lawyer's
p198
aVor your service provider's,
p199
aVand it's not for the public record anyway.
p200
aVAnd then you add the owner of the company.
p201
aVNow this is the key part,
p202
aVand again it doesn't have to be you,
p203
aVbecause you can get creative,
p204
aVbecause there is a whole universe  out there of nominees
p205
aVto choose from.
p206
aVAnd nominees are the people that you
p207
aVcan legally pay to be your company's owner.
p208
aVAnd if you don't want to involve anyone else,
p209
aVit doesn't even have to be an actual human being.
p210
aVIt could be another company.
p211
aVAnd then finally,
p212
aVgive your company a name
p213
aVadd a few more details and make your payment.
p214
aVAnd then the service provider
p215
aVwill take a few hours or more to process it.
p216
aVBut there you are,
p217
aVin 10 minutes of online shopping
p218
aVyou can create yourself an anonymous company.
p219
aVAnd not only is it easy,
p220
aVreally, really easy and cheap,
p221
aVit's totally legal too.
p222
aVBut the fun doesn't have to end there,
p223
aVmaybe you want to be even more anonymous.
p224
aVWell, that's no problem either.
p225
aVYou can simply keep adding layers,
p226
aVcompanies owned by companies.
p227
aVYou can have hundreds of layers
p228
aVwith hundreds of companies spread across
p229
aVlots of different countries,
p230
aVlike a giant web,
p231
aVeach layer adds anonymity.
p232
aVEach layer makes it more difficult
p233
aVfor law enforcement and others
p234
aVto find out who the real owner is.
p235
aVBut whose interests is this all serving?
p236
aVIt might be in the interests of the company
p237
aVor a particular individual,
p238
aVbut what about all of us, the public?
p239
aVThere hasn't even been a global conversation yet
p240
aVabout whether it's okay
p241
aVto misuse companies in this way.
p242
aVAnd what does it all mean for us?
p243
aa(lp244
VWell, an example that really haunts me
p245
aVis one I came across recently.
p246
aVAnd it's that of a horrific fire
p247
aVin a nightclub in Buenos Aires
p248
aVabout a decade ago.
p249
aVIt was the night before New Year's Eve.
p250
aVThree thousand very happy revelers,
p251
aVmany of them teenagers,
p252
aVwere crammed into a space meant for 1,000.
p253
aVAnd then tragedy struck,
p254
aVa fire broke out
p255
aVplastic decorations were melting from the ceiling
p256
aVand toxic smoke filled the club.
p257
aVSo people tried to escape
p258
aVonly to find that some of the fire doors
p259
aVhad been chained shut.
p260
aVOver 200 people died.
p261
aVSeven hundred were injured trying to get out.
p262
aVAnd as the victims' families  and the city and the country
p263
aVreeled in shock,
p264
aVinvestigators tried to find out who was responsible.
p265
aVAnd as they looked for the owners of the club,
p266
aVthey found instead anonymous companies,
p267
aVand confusion surrounded the identities of those
p268
aVinvolved with the companies.
p269
aVNow ultimately, a range of people were charged
p270
aVand some went to jail.
p271
aVBut this was an awful tragedy,
p272
aVand it shouldn't have been so difficult
p273
aVjust to try and find out who was responsible
p274
aVfor those deaths.
p275
aVBecause in an age
p276
aVwhen there is so much information
p277
aVout there in the open,
p278
aVwhy should this crucial information
p279
aVabout company ownership
p280
aVstay hidden away?
p281
aVWhy should tax evaders, corrupt  government officials,
p282
aVarms traders and more,
p283
aVbe able to hide their identities from us, the public?
p284
aVWhy should this secrecy be such  an accepted business practice?
p285
aVAnonymous companies
p286
aVmight be the norm right now
p287
aVbut it wasn't always this way.
p288
aVCompanies were created
p289
aVto give people a chance to innovate
p290
aVand not have to put everything on the line.
p291
aVCompanies were created to limit financial risk,
p292
aVthey were never intended to  be used as a moral shield.
p293
aVCompanies were never intended to be anonymous,
p294
aVand they don't have to be.
p295
aa(lp296
VAnd so I come to my wish.
p297
aVMy wish is for us to know
p298
aVwho owns and controls companies
p299
aVso that they can no longer be used anonymously
p300
aVagainst the public good.
p301
aVTogether let's ignite world opinion,
p302
aVchange the law,
p303
aVand launch a new era of openness in business.
p304
aVSo what might this look like?
p305
aVWell, imagine if you could go online
p306
aVand look up the real owner of a company.
p307
aVImagine if this data were open and free,
p308
aVaccessible across borders
p309
aVfor citizens and businesses
p310
aVand law enforcement alike.
p311
aVImagine what a game changer that would be.
p312
aVSo how are we going to do this?
p313
aVWell, there is only one way.
p314
aVTogether, we have to change the law globally
p315
aVto create public registries
p316
aVwhich list the true owners of companies
p317
aVand can be accessed by all
p318
aVwith no loopholes.
p319
aVAnd yes, this is ambitious,
p320
aVbut there is momentum on this issue,
p321
aVand over the years I have seen
p322
aVthe sheer power of momentum,
p323
aVand it's just starting on this issue.
p324
aVThere is such an opportunity right now.
p325
aVAnd the TED community
p326
aVof creative and innovative thinkers and doers
p327
aVacross all of society
p328
aVcould make the crucial difference.
p329
aVYou really can make this change happen.
p330
aVNow, a simple starting point
p331
aVis the address behind me
p332
aVfor a Facebook page that you can join now
p333
aVto support the campaign and spread the word.
p334
aVIt's going to be a springboard
p335
aVfor our global campaigning.
p336
aVAnd the techies among you,
p337
aVyou could really help us create a prototype
p338
aVpublic registry
p339
aVto demonstrate what a powerful tool this could be.
p340
aVCampaign groups from around the world
p341
aVhave come together to work on this issue.
p342
aVThe U.K. government is already on board;
p343
aVit supports these public registries.
p344
aVAnd just last week,
p345
aVthe European Parliament came on board
p346
aVwith a vote 600 to 30 in favor of public registries.
p347
aVThat is momentum.
p348
aV(Applause)
p349
aVBut it's early days.
p350
aVAmerica still needs to come on board,
p351
aVas do so many other countries.
p352
aVAnd to succeed we will all together
p353
aVneed to help and push our politicians,
p354
aVbecause without that,
p355
aVreal far-reaching, world-shifting change
p356
aVjust isn't going to happen.
p357
aVBecause this isn't just about changing the law,
p358
aVthis is about starting a conversation
p359
aVabout what it's okay for companies to do,
p360
aVand in what ways is it acceptable  to use company structures.
p361
aVThis isn't just a dry policy issue.
p362
aVThis is a human issue
p363
aVwhich affects us all.
p364
aVThis is about being on the right side of history.
p365
aVGlobal citizens, innovators,  business leaders, individuals,
p366
aVwe need you.
p367
aVTogether, let's kickstart this global movement.
p368
aVLet's just do it,
p369
aVlet's end anonymous companies.
p370
aVThank you.
