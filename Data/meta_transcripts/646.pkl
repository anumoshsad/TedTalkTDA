VI'd like to talk a little bit this morning
p4
aVabout what happens if we move from design
p5
aVto design thinking.
p6
aVNow this rather old photo up there
p7
aVis actually the first project I was ever hired to do,
p8
aVsomething like 25 years ago.
p9
aVIt's a woodworking machine, or at least a piece of one,
p10
aVand my task was to
p11
aVmake this thing a little bit more modern,
p12
aVa little bit easier to use.
p13
aVI thought, at the time, I did a pretty good job.
p14
aVUnfortunately, not very long afterwards
p15
aVthe company went out of business.
p16
aa(lp17
VThis is the second project that I did. It's a fax machine.
p18
aVI put an attractive shell around some new technology.
p19
aVAgain, 18 months later,
p20
aVthe product was obsolete.
p21
aVAnd now, of course, the whole technology is obsolete.
p22
aVNow, I'm a fairly slow learner,
p23
aVbut eventually it occurred to me that
p24
aVmaybe what passed for design
p25
aVwasn't all that important \u2014
p26
aVmaking things more attractive,
p27
aVmaking them a bit easier to use,
p28
aVmaking them more marketable.
p29
aVBy focusing on a design,
p30
aVmaybe just a single product,
p31
aVI was being incremental
p32
aVand not having much of an impact.
p33
aa(lp34
VBut I think this small view of design
p35
aVis a relatively recent phenomenon,
p36
aVand in fact really emerged
p37
aVin the latter half of the 20th century
p38
aVas design became a tool of consumerism.
p39
aVSo when we talk about design today,
p40
aVand particularly when we read about it in the popular press,
p41
aVwe're often talking about products like these.
p42
aVAmusing? Yes. Desirable? Maybe.
p43
aVImportant? Not so very.
p44
aa(lp45
VBut this wasn't always the way.
p46
aVAnd I'd like to suggest that if we take
p47
aVa different view of design,
p48
aVand focus less on the object
p49
aVand more on design thinking as an approach,
p50
aVthat we actually might see the result in a bigger impact.
p51
aVNow this gentleman, Isambard Kingdom Brunel,
p52
aVdesigned many great things in his career in the 19th century,
p53
aVincluding the Clifton suspension bridge in Bristol
p54
aVand the Thames tunnel at Rotherhithe.
p55
aVBoth great designs and actually very innovative too.
p56
aVHis greatest creation
p57
aVruns actually right through here in Oxford.
p58
aVIt's called the Great Western Railway.
p59
aa(lp60
VAnd as a kid I grew up very close to here,
p61
aVand one of my favorite things to do
p62
aVwas to cycle along by the side of the railway
p63
aVwaiting for the great big express trains to roar past.
p64
aVYou can see it represented here in J.M.W. Turner's painting,
p65
aV"Rain, Steam and Speed".
p66
aVNow, what Brunel said that he wanted to achieve for his passengers
p67
aVwas the experience of floating across the countryside.
p68
aa(lp69
VNow, this was back in the 19th century.
p70
aVAnd to do that meant creating the flattest gradients
p71
aVthat had ever yet been made,
p72
aVwhich meant building long viaducts across river valleys \u2014
p73
aVthis is actually the viaduct across the Thames at Maidenhead \u2014
p74
aVand long tunnels such as the one at Box, in Wiltshire.
p75
aVBut he didn't stop there. He didn't stop
p76
aVwith just trying to design the best railway journey.
p77
aVHe imagined an integrated transportation system
p78
aVin which it would be possible for a passenger to embark
p79
aVon a train in London
p80
aVand disembark from a ship in New York.
p81
aVOne journey from London to New York.
p82
aVThis is the S.S. Great Western that he built
p83
aVto take care of the second half of that journey.
p84
aa(lp85
VNow, Brunel was working 100 years before
p86
aVthe emergence of the design profession,
p87
aVbut I think he was using design thinking
p88
aVto solve problems and to create world-changing innovations.
p89
aVNow, design thinking begins with what Roger Martin,
p90
aVthe business school professor at the University of Toronto,
p91
aVcalls integrative thinking.
p92
aVAnd that's the ability to exploit opposing ideas
p93
aVand opposing constraints
p94
aVto create new solutions.
p95
aVIn the case of design, that means
p96
aVbalancing desirability, what humans need,
p97
aVwith technical feasibility,
p98
aVand economic viability.
p99
aVWith innovations like the Great Western,
p100
aVwe can stretch that balance to the absolute limit.
p101
aa(lp102
VSo somehow, we went from this to this.
p103
aVSystems thinkers who were reinventing the world,
p104
aVto a priesthood of folks in black turtlenecks and designer glasses
p105
aVworking on small things.
p106
aVAs our industrial society matured,
p107
aVso design became a profession
p108
aVand it focused on an ever smaller canvas
p109
aVuntil it came to stand for aesthetics,
p110
aVimage and fashion.
p111
aVNow I'm not trying to throw stones here.
p112
aVI'm a fully paid-up member of that priesthood,
p113
aVand somewhere in here I have my designer glasses.
p114
aVThere we go.
p115
aVBut I do think that perhaps design
p116
aVis getting big again.
p117
aVAnd that's happening through
p118
aVthe application of design thinking
p119
aVto new kinds of problems \u2014
p120
aVto global warming, to education,
p121
aVhealthcare, security, clean water, whatever.
p122
aa(lp123
VAnd as we see this reemergence of design thinking
p124
aVand we see it beginning to tackle new kinds of problems,
p125
aVthere are some basic ideas that I think we can observe that are useful.
p126
aVAnd I'd like to talk about some of those
p127
aVjust for the next few minutes.
p128
aVThe first of those is that design is
p129
aVhuman-centered.
p130
aVIt may integrate technology and economics,
p131
aVbut it starts with what humans need, or might need.
p132
aVWhat makes life easier, more enjoyable?
p133
aVWhat makes technology useful and usable?
p134
aVBut that is more than simply good ergonomics,
p135
aVputting the buttons in the right place.
p136
aVIt's often about understanding culture and context
p137
aVbefore we even know where to start to have ideas.
p138
aa(lp139
VSo when a team was working on a new vision screening program in India,
p140
aVthey wanted to understand what the aspirations
p141
aVand motivations were of these school children
p142
aVto understand how they might play a role
p143
aVin screening their parents.
p144
aVConversion Sound has developed a high quality,
p145
aVultra-low-cost digital hearing aid
p146
aVfor the developing world.
p147
aVNow, in the West we rely on highly trained technicians
p148
aVto fit these hearing aids.
p149
aVIn places like India, those technicians simply don't exist.
p150
aVSo it took a team working in India
p151
aVwith patients and community health workers
p152
aVto understand how a PDA
p153
aVand an application on a PDA
p154
aVmight replace those technicians
p155
aVin a fitting and diagnostic service.
p156
aa(lp157
VInstead of starting with technology,
p158
aVthe team started with people and culture.
p159
aVSo if human need is the place to start,
p160
aVthen design thinking rapidly moves on to
p161
aVlearning by making.
p162
aVInstead of thinking about what to build,
p163
aVbuilding in order to think.
p164
aVNow, prototypes speed up the process of innovation,
p165
aVbecause it is only when we put our ideas out into the world
p166
aVthat we really start to understand their strengths and weaknesses.
p167
aVAnd the faster we do that,
p168
aVthe faster our ideas evolve.
p169
aa(lp170
VNow, much has been said and written about
p171
aVthe Aravind Eye Institute in Madurai, India.
p172
aVThey do an incredible job of serving very poor patients
p173
aVby taking the revenues from those who can afford to pay
p174
aVto cross-subsidize those who cannot.
p175
aVNow, they are very efficient,
p176
aVbut they are also very innovative.
p177
aVWhen I visited them a few years ago,
p178
aVwhat really impressed me was their willingness
p179
aVto prototype their ideas very early.
p180
aa(lp181
VThis is the manufacturing facility
p182
aVfor one of their biggest cost breakthroughs.
p183
aVThey make their own intraocular lenses.
p184
aVThese are the lenses that replace those
p185
aVthat are damaged by cataracts.
p186
aVAnd I think it's partly their prototyping mentality
p187
aVthat really allowed them to achieve the breakthrough.
p188
aVBecause they brought the cost down
p189
aVfrom $200 a pair,
p190
aVdown to just $4 a pair.
p191
aVPartly they did this by instead of building
p192
aVa fancy new factory,
p193
aVthey used the basement of one of their hospitals.
p194
aVAnd instead of installing the large-scale machines
p195
aVused by western producers,
p196
aVthey used low-cost CAD/CAM prototyping technology.
p197
aVThey are now the biggest manufacturer of these lenses in the developing world
p198
aVand have recently moved into a custom factory.
p199
aa(lp200
VSo if human need is the place to start,
p201
aVand prototyping, a vehicle for progress,
p202
aVthen there are also some questions to ask about the destination.
p203
aVInstead of seeing its primary objective as consumption,
p204
aVdesign thinking is beginning to explore the potential of participation \u2014
p205
aVthe shift from a passive relationship
p206
aVbetween consumer and producer
p207
aVto the active engagement of everyone
p208
aVin experiences that are meaningful,
p209
aVproductive and profitable.
p210
aa(lp211
VSo I'd like to take the idea that Rory Sutherland talked about,
p212
aVthis notion that intangible things are worth perhaps more than physical things,
p213
aVand take that a little bit further and say that
p214
aVI think the design of participatory systems,
p215
aVin which many more forms of value
p216
aVbeyond simply cash
p217
aVare both created and measured,
p218
aVis going to be the major theme, not only for design,
p219
aVbut also for our economy as we go forward.
p220
aa(lp221
VSo William Beveridge, when he wrote the first of his famous reports in 1942,
p222
aVcreated what became Britain's welfare state
p223
aVin which he hoped that every citizen
p224
aVwould be an active participant
p225
aVin their own social well-being.
p226
aVBy the time he wrote his third report,
p227
aVhe confessed that he had failed
p228
aVand instead had created a society of welfare consumers.
p229
aa(lp230
VHilary Cottam, Charlie Leadbeater,
p231
aVand Hugo Manassei of Participle
p232
aVhave taken this idea of participation,
p233
aVand in their manifesto entitled Beveridge 4.0,
p234
aVthey are suggesting a framework
p235
aVfor reinventing the welfare state.
p236
aVSo in one of their projects called Southwark Circle,
p237
aVthey worked with residents in Southwark, South London
p238
aVand a small team of designers
p239
aVto develop a new membership organization
p240
aVto help the elderly with household tasks.
p241
aVDesigns were refined and developed
p242
aVwith 150 older people and their families
p243
aVbefore the service was launched earlier this year.
p244
aa(lp245
VWe can take this idea of participation
p246
aVperhaps to its logical conclusion
p247
aVand say that design may have its greatest impact
p248
aVwhen it's taken out of the hands of designers
p249
aVand put into the hands of everyone.
p250
aVNurses and practitioners at U.S. healthcare system
p251
aVKaiser Permanente
p252
aVstudy the topic of improving the patient experience,
p253
aVand particularly focused on the way that they exchange knowledge
p254
aVand change shift.
p255
aVThrough a program of observational research,
p256
aVbrainstorming new solutions and rapid prototyping,
p257
aVthey've developed a completely new way to change shift.
p258
aa(lp259
VThey went from retreating to the nurse's station
p260
aVto discuss the various states and needs of patients,
p261
aVto developing a system that happened on the ward
p262
aVin front of patients, using a simple software tool.
p263
aVBy doing this they brought the time that they were away from patients
p264
aVdown from 40 minutes to 12 minutes, on average.
p265
aVThey increased patient confidence and nurse happiness.
p266
aVWhen you multiply that by all the nurses
p267
aVin all the wards in 40 hospitals in the system,
p268
aVit resulted, actually, in a pretty big impact.
p269
aa(lp270
VAnd this is just one of thousands
p271
aVof opportunities in healthcare alone.
p272
aVSo these are just some of the kind of basic ideas
p273
aVaround design thinking
p274
aVand some of the new kinds of projects
p275
aVthat they're being applied to.
p276
aVBut I'd like to go back to Brunel here,
p277
aVand suggest a connection that might explain why this is happening now,
p278
aVand maybe why design thinking is a useful tool.
p279
aVAnd that connection is change.
p280
aVIn times of change we need
p281
aVnew alternatives, new ideas.
p282
aa(lp283
VNow, Brunel worked at the height of the Industrial Revolution,
p284
aVwhen all of life and our economy
p285
aVwas being reinvented.
p286
aVNow the industrial systems of Brunel's time have run their course,
p287
aVand indeed they are part of the problem today.
p288
aVBut, again, we are in the midst of massive change.
p289
aVAnd that change is forcing us to question
p290
aVquite fundamental aspects of our society \u2014
p291
aVhow we keep ourselves healthy, how we govern ourselves,
p292
aVhow we educate ourselves, how we keep ourselves secure.
p293
aVAnd in these times of change, we need these new choices
p294
aVbecause our existing solutions are simply becoming obsolete.
p295
aa(lp296
VSo why design thinking?
p297
aVBecause it gives us a new way of tackling problems.
p298
aVInstead of defaulting to our normal convergent approach
p299
aVwhere we make the best choice out of available alternatives,
p300
aVit encourages us to take a divergent approach,
p301
aVto explore new alternatives, new solutions,
p302
aVnew ideas that have not existed before.
p303
aVBut before we go through that process of divergence,
p304
aVthere is actually quite an important first step.
p305
aVAnd that is, what is the question that we're trying to answer?
p306
aVWhat's the design brief?
p307
aVNow Brunel may have asked a question like this,
p308
aV"How do I take a train from London to New York?"
p309
aVBut what are the kinds of questions that we might ask today?
p310
aa(lp311
VSo these are some that we've been asked to think about recently.
p312
aVAnd one in particular, is one that we're working on with the Acumen Fund,
p313
aVin a project that's been funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
p314
aVHow might we improve access to safe drinking water
p315
aVfor the world's poorest people,
p316
aVand at the same time stimulate innovation
p317
aVamongst local water providers?
p318
aa(lp319
VSo instead of having a bunch of American designers
p320
aVcome up with new ideas that may or may not have been appropriate,
p321
aVwe took a sort of more open, collaborative and participative approach.
p322
aVWe teamed designers and investment experts up with
p323
aV11 water organizations across India.
p324
aVAnd through workshops they developed
p325
aVinnovative new products, services, and business models.
p326
aa(lp327
VWe hosted a competition
p328
aVand then funded five of those organizations
p329
aVto develop their ideas.
p330
aVSo they developed and iterated these ideas.
p331
aVAnd then IDEO and Acumen spent several weeks working with them
p332
aVto help design new social marketing campaigns,
p333
aVcommunity outreach strategies, business models,
p334
aVnew water vessels for storing water
p335
aVand carts for delivering water.
p336
aVSome of those ideas are just getting launched into the market.
p337
aVAnd the same process is just getting underway
p338
aVwith NGOs in East Africa.
p339
aa(lp340
VSo for me, this project shows
p341
aVkind of how far we can go from
p342
aVsome of those sort of small things
p343
aVthat I was working on
p344
aVat the beginning of my career.
p345
aVThat by focusing on the needs of humans
p346
aVand by using prototypes
p347
aVto move ideas along quickly,
p348
aVby getting the process out of the hands of designers,
p349
aVand by getting the active participation of the community,
p350
aVwe can tackle bigger and more interesting questions.
p351
aVAnd just like Brunel, by focusing on systems,
p352
aVwe can have a bigger impact.
p353
aVSo that's one thing that we've been working on.
p354
aa(lp355
VI'm actually really quite interested, and perhaps more interested
p356
aVto know what this community thinks we could work on.
p357
aVWhat kinds of questions do we think
p358
aVdesign thinking could be used to tackle?
p359
aVAnd if you've got any ideas
p360
aVthen feel free, you can post them to Twitter.
p361
aVThere is a hash tag there that you can use, #CBDQ.
p362
aVAnd the list looked something like this a little while ago.
p363
aVAnd of course you can search to find the questions that you're interested in
p364
aVby using the same hash code.
p365
aa(lp366
VSo I'd like to believe that design thinking
p367
aVactually can make a difference,
p368
aVthat it can help create new ideas
p369
aVand new innovations,
p370
aVbeyond the latest High Street products.
p371
aVTo do that I think we have to take a more expansive view of design,
p372
aVmore like Brunel, less a domain of a professional priesthood.
p373
aVAnd the first step is to start asking the right questions.
p374
aVThank you very much.
