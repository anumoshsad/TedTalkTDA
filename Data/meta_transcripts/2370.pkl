VJenni Chang: When I told my parents I was gay,
p4
aVthe first thing they said to me was,
p5
aV"We're bringing you back to Taiwan."
p6
aa(lp7
V(Laughter)
p8
aa(lp9
VIn their minds, my sexual orientation was America's fault.
p10
aVThe West had corrupted me with divergent ideas,
p11
aVand if only my parents had never left Taiwan,
p12
aVthis would not have happened to their only daughter.
p13
aVIn truth, I wondered if they were right.
p14
aa(lp15
VOf course, there are gay people in Asia,
p16
aVjust as there are gay people in every part of the world.
p17
aVBut is the idea of living an "out" life,
p18
aVin the "I'm gay, this is my spouse, and we're proud of our lives together"
p19
aVkind of way just a Western idea?
p20
aa(lp21
VIf I had grown up in Taiwan, or any place outside of the West,
p22
aVwould I have found models of happy, thriving LGBT people?
p23
aa(lp24
VLisa Dazols: I had similar notions.
p25
aVAs an HIV social worker in San Francisco,
p26
aVI had met many gay immigrants.
p27
aVThey told me their stories of persecution in their home countries,
p28
aVjust for being gay,
p29
aVand the reasons why they escaped to the US.
p30
aVI saw how this had beaten them down.
p31
aVAfter 10 years of doing this kind of work,
p32
aVI needed better stories for myself.
p33
aVI knew the world was far from perfect,
p34
aVbut surely not every gay story was tragic.
p35
aa(lp36
VJC: So as a couple, we both had a need to find stories of hope.
p37
aVSo we set off on a mission to travel the world
p38
aVand look for the people we finally termed as the "Supergays."
p39
aa(lp40
V(Laughter)
p41
aa(lp42
VThese would be the LGBT individuals
p43
aVwho were doing something extraordinary in the world.
p44
aVThey would be courageous, resilient,
p45
aVand most of all, proud of who they were.
p46
aVThey would be the kind of person that I aspire to be.
p47
aVOur plan was to share their stories to the world through film.
p48
aa(lp49
VLD: There was just one problem.
p50
aVWe had zero reporting and zero filmmaking experience.
p51
aa(lp52
V(Laughter)
p53
aa(lp54
VWe didn't even know where to find the Supergays,
p55
aVso we just had to trust that we'd figure it all out along the way.
p56
aVSo we picked 15 countries in Asia, Africa and South America,
p57
aVcountries outside the West that varied in terms of LGBT rights.
p58
aVWe bought a camcorder,
p59
aVordered a book on how to make a documentary \u2014
p60
aa(lp61
V(Laughter)
p62
aa(lp63
Vyou can learn a lot these days \u2014
p64
aVand set off on an around-the-world trip.
p65
aa(lp66
VJC: One of the first countries that we traveled to was Nepal.
p67
aVDespite widespread poverty, a decade-long civil war,
p68
aVand now recently, a devastating earthquake,
p69
aVNepal has made significant strides in the fight for equality.
p70
aVOne of the key figures in the movement is Bhumika Shrestha.
p71
aVA beautiful, vibrant transgendered woman,
p72
aVBhumika has had to overcome being expelled from school
p73
aVand getting incarcerated because of her gender presentation.
p74
aVBut, in 2007, Bhumika and Nepal's LGBT rights organization
p75
aVsuccessfully petitioned the Nepali Supreme Court
p76
aVto protect against LGBT discrimination.
p77
aa(lp78
VHere's Bhumika:
p79
aa(lp80
V(Video) BS: What I'm most proud of?
p81
aVI'm a transgendered person.
p82
aVI'm so proud of my life.
p83
aVOn December 21, 2007,
p84
aVthe supreme court gave the decision for the Nepal government
p85
aVto give transgender identity cards
p86
aVand same-sex marriage.
p87
aa(lp88
VLD: I can appreciate Bhumika's confidence on a daily basis.
p89
aVSomething as simple as using a public restroom
p90
aVcan be a huge challenge when you don't fit in
p91
aVto people's strict gender expectations.
p92
aVTraveling throughout Asia,
p93
aVI tended to freak out women in public restrooms.
p94
aVThey weren't used to seeing someone like me.
p95
aVI had to come up with a strategy, so that I could just pee in peace.
p96
aa(lp97
V(Laughter)
p98
aa(lp99
VSo anytime I would enter a restroom,
p100
aVI would thrust out my chest to show my womanly parts,
p101
aVand try to be as non-threatening as possible.
p102
aVPutting out my hands and saying, "Hello",
p103
aVjust so that people could hear my feminine voice.
p104
aVThis all gets pretty exhausting, but it's just who I am.
p105
aVI can't be anything else.
p106
aa(lp107
VJC: After Nepal, we traveled to India.
p108
aVOn one hand, India is a Hindu society,
p109
aVwithout a tradition of homophobia.
p110
aVOn the other hand, it is also a society with a deeply patriarchal system,
p111
aVwhich rejects anything that threatens the male-female order.
p112
aVWhen we spoke to activists,
p113
aVthey told us that empowerment begins with ensuring proper gender equality,
p114
aVwhere the women's status is established in society.
p115
aVAnd in that way, the status of LGBT people can be affirmed as well.
p116
aa(lp117
VLD: There we met Prince Manvendra.
p118
aVHe's the world's first openly gay prince.
p119
aVPrince Manvendra came out on the "Oprah Winfrey Show,"
p120
aVvery internationally.
p121
aVHis parents disowned him
p122
aVand accused him of bringing great shame to the royal family.
p123
aVWe sat down with Prince Manvendra
p124
aVand talked to him about why he decided to come out so very publicly.
p125
aa(lp126
VHere he is:
p127
aa(lp128
V(Video) Prince Manvendra:  I felt there was a lot of need
p129
aVto break this stigma and discrimination which is existing in our society.
p130
aVAnd that instigated me to come out openly and talk about myself.
p131
aVWhether we are gay, we are lesbian, we are transgender, bisexual
p132
aVor whatever sexual minority we come from,
p133
aVwe have to all unite and fight for our rights.
p134
aVGay rights cannot be won in the court rooms,
p135
aVbut in the hearts and the minds of the people.
p136
aa(lp137
VJC: While getting my hair cut,
p138
aVthe woman cutting my hair asked me,
p139
aV"Do you have a husband?"
p140
aVNow, this was a dreaded question
p141
aVthat I got asked a lot by locals while traveling.
p142
aVWhen I explained to her that I was with a woman instead of a man,
p143
aVshe was incredulous,
p144
aVand she asked me a lot of questions about my parents' reactions
p145
aVand whether I was sad that I'd never be able to have children.
p146
aVI told her that there are no limitations to my life
p147
aVand that Lisa and I do plan to have a family some day.
p148
aVNow, this woman was ready to write me off
p149
aVas yet another crazy Westerner.
p150
aVShe couldn't imagine that such a phenomenon
p151
aVcould happen in her own country.
p152
aVThat is, until I showed her the photos of the Supergays
p153
aVthat we interviewed in India.
p154
aVShe recognized Prince Manvendra from television
p155
aVand soon I had an audience of other hairdressers
p156
aVinterested in meeting me.
p157
aa(lp158
V(Laughter)
p159
aa(lp160
VAnd in that ordinary afternoon,
p161
aVI had the chance to introduce an entire beauty salon
p162
aVto the social changes that were happening in their own country.
p163
aa(lp164
VLD: From India, we traveled to East Africa,
p165
aVa region known for intolerance towards LGBT people.
p166
aVIn Kenya, 89 percent of people who come out to their families
p167
aVare disowned.
p168
aVHomosexual acts are a crime and can lead to incarceration.
p169
aVIn Kenya, we met the soft-spoken David Kuria.
p170
aVDavid had a huge mission of wanting to work for the poor
p171
aVand improve his own government.
p172
aVSo he decided to run for senate.
p173
aVHe became Kenya's first openly gay political candidate.
p174
aVDavid wanted to run his campaign without denying the reality of who he was.
p175
aVBut we were worried for his safety
p176
aVbecause he started to receive death threats.
p177
aa(lp178
V(Video) David Kuria:  At that point, I was really scared
p179
aVbecause they were actually asking for me to be killed.
p180
aVAnd, yeah,
p181
aVthere are some people out there who do it
p182
aVand they feel that they are doing a religious obligation.
p183
aa(lp184
VJC: David wasn't ashamed of who he was.
p185
aVEven in the face of threats,
p186
aVhe stayed authentic.
p187
aa(lp188
VLD: At the opposite end of the spectrum is Argentina.
p189
aVArgentina's a country where 92 percent of the population identifies as Catholic.
p190
aVYet, Argentina has LGBT laws that are even more progressive
p191
aVthan here in the US.
p192
aVIn 2010, Argentina became the first country in Latin America
p193
aVand the 10th in the world to adopt marriage equality.
p194
aa(lp195
VThere, we met María Rachid.
p196
aVMaría was a driving force behind that movement.
p197
aa(lp198
VMaría Rachid (Spanish): I always say that, in reality,
p199
aVthe effects of marriage equality
p200
aVare not only for those couples that get married.
p201
aVThey are for a lot of people that, even though they may never get married,
p202
aVwill be perceived differently by their coworkers,
p203
aVtheir families and neighbors,
p204
aVfrom the national state's message of equality.
p205
aVI feel very proud of Argentina
p206
aVbecause Argentina today is a model of equality.
p207
aVAnd hopefully soon,
p208
aVthe whole world will have the same rights.
p209
aa(lp210
VJC: When we made the visit to my ancestral lands,
p211
aVI wish I could have shown my parents what we found there.
p212
aVBecause here is who we met:
p213
aa(lp214
V(Video) One, two, three. Welcome gays to Shanghai!
p215
aa(lp216
V(Laughter)
p217
aa(lp218
VA whole community of young, beautiful Chinese LGBT people.
p219
aVSure, they had their struggles.
p220
aVBut they were fighting it out.
p221
aVIn Shanghai, I had the chance to speak to a local lesbian group
p222
aVand tell them our story in my broken Mandarin Chinese.
p223
aVIn Taipei, each time we got onto the metro,
p224
aVwe saw yet another lesbian couple holding hands.
p225
aVAnd we learned that Asia's largest LGBT pride event
p226
aVhappens just blocks away from where my grandparents live.
p227
aVIf only my parents knew.
p228
aa(lp229
VLD: By the time we finished our not-so-straight journey around the world,
p230
aa(lp231
V(Laughter)
p232
aa(lp233
Vwe had traveled 50,000 miles
p234
aVand logged 120 hours of video footage.
p235
aVWe traveled to 15 countries
p236
aVand interviewed 50 Supergays.
p237
aVTurns out, it wasn't hard to find them at all.
p238
aa(lp239
VJC: Yes, there are still tragedies that happen
p240
aVon the bumpy road to equality.
p241
aVAnd let's not forget that 75 countries still criminalize homosexuality today.
p242
aVBut there are also stories of hope and courage
p243
aVin every corner of the world.
p244
aVWhat we ultimately took away from our journey is,
p245
aVequality is not a Western invention.
p246
aa(lp247
VLD: One of the key factors in this equality movement is momentum,
p248
aVmomentum as more and more people embrace their full selves
p249
aVand use whatever opportunities they have
p250
aVto change their part of the world,
p251
aVand momentum as more and more countries
p252
aVfind models of equality in one another.
p253
aVWhen Nepal protected against LGBT discrimination,
p254
aVIndia pushed harder.
p255
aVWhen Argentina embraced marriage equality,
p256
aVUruguay and Brazil followed.
p257
aVWhen Ireland said yes to equality,
p258
aa(lp259
V(Applause)
p260
aa(lp261
Vthe world stopped to notice.
p262
aVWhen the US Supreme Court makes a statement to the world
p263
aVthat we can all be proud of.
p264
aa(lp265
V(Applause)
p266
aa(lp267
VJC: As we reviewed our footage,
p268
aVwhat we realized is that we were watching a love story.
p269
aVIt wasn't a love story that was expected of me,
p270
aVbut it is one filled with more freedom, adventure and love
p271
aVthan I could have ever possibly imagined.
p272
aVOne year after returning home from our trip,
p273
aVmarriage equality came to California.
p274
aVAnd in the end, we believe, love will win out.
p275
aa(lp276
V(Video) By the power vested in me,
p277
aVby the state of California
p278
aVand by God Almighty,
p279
aVI now pronounce you spouses for life.
p280
aVYou may kiss.
p281
