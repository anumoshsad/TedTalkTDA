(lp3
VGood morning. How are you?
p4
aa(lp5
V(Laughter)
p6
aa(lp7
VIt's been great, hasn't it?
p8
aVI've been blown away by the whole thing.
p9
aVIn fact, I'm leaving.
p10
aa(lp11
V(Laughter)
p12
aa(lp13
VThere have been three themes running through the conference
p14
aVwhich are relevant to what I want to talk about.
p15
aVOne is the extraordinary evidence of human creativity
p16
aVin all of the presentations that we've had
p17
aVand in all of the people here.
p18
aVJust the variety of it and the range of it.
p19
aVThe second is that it's put us in a place
p20
aVwhere we have no idea what's going to happen,
p21
aVin terms of the future.
p22
aVNo idea how this may play out.
p23
aa(lp24
VI have an interest in education.
p25
aVActually, what I find is everybody has an interest in education.
p26
aVDon't you?
p27
aVI find this very interesting.
p28
aVIf you're at a dinner party,
p29
aVand you say you work in education \u2014
p30
aVActually, you're not often at dinner parties, frankly.
p31
aa(lp32
V(Laughter)
p33
aa(lp34
VIf you work in education, you're not asked.
p35
aa(lp36
V(Laughter)
p37
aa(lp38
VAnd you're never asked back, curiously. That's strange to me.
p39
aVBut if you are, and you say to somebody,
p40
aVyou know, they say, "What do you do?"
p41
aVand you say you work in education,
p42
aVyou can see the blood run from their face.
p43
aVThey're like, "Oh my God," you know, "Why me?"
p44
aa(lp45
V(Laughter)
p46
aa(lp47
V"My one night out all week."
p48
aa(lp49
V(Laughter)
p50
aa(lp51
VBut if you ask about their education, they pin you to the wall.
p52
aVBecause it's one of those things that goes deep with people, am I right?
p53
aVLike religion, and money and other things.
p54
aVSo I have a big interest in education, and I think we all do.
p55
aVWe have a huge vested interest in it,
p56
aVpartly because it's education that's meant to take us into this future
p57
aVthat we can't grasp.
p58
aVIf you think of it, children starting school this year
p59
aVwill be retiring in 2065.
p60
aVNobody has a clue,
p61
aVdespite all the expertise that's been on parade for the past four days,
p62
aVwhat the world will look like in five years' time.
p63
aVAnd yet we're meant to be educating them for it.
p64
aVSo the unpredictability, I think, is extraordinary.
p65
aa(lp66
VAnd the third part of this
p67
aVis that we've all agreed, nonetheless,
p68
aVon the really extraordinary capacities that children have \u2014
p69
aVtheir capacities for innovation.
p70
aVI mean, Sirena last night was a marvel, wasn't she?
p71
aVJust seeing what she could do.
p72
aVAnd she's exceptional, but I think she's not, so to speak,
p73
aVexceptional in the whole of childhood.
p74
aVWhat you have there is a person of extraordinary dedication
p75
aVwho found a talent.
p76
aVAnd my contention is, all kids have tremendous talents.
p77
aVAnd we squander them, pretty ruthlessly.
p78
aa(lp79
VSo I want to talk about education
p80
aVand I want to talk about creativity.
p81
aVMy contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy,
p82
aVand we should treat it with the same status.
p83
aa(lp84
V(Applause) Thank you.
p85
aa(lp86
V(Applause)
p87
aa(lp88
VThat was it, by the way.
p89
aVThank you very much.
p90
aa(lp91
V(Laughter)
p92
aa(lp93
VSo, 15 minutes left.
p94
aa(lp95
V(Laughter)
p96
aa(lp97
VWell, I was born... no.
p98
aa(lp99
V(Laughter)
p100
aa(lp101
VI heard a great story recently \u2014 I love telling it \u2014
p102
aVof a little girl who was in a drawing lesson.
p103
aVShe was six, and she was at the back, drawing,
p104
aVand the teacher said this girl hardly ever paid attention,
p105
aVand in this drawing lesson, she did.
p106
aVThe teacher was fascinated.
p107
aVShe went over to her, and she said, "What are you drawing?"
p108
aVAnd the girl said, "I'm drawing a picture of God."
p109
aVAnd the teacher said, "But nobody knows what God looks like."
p110
aVAnd the girl said, "They will, in a minute."
p111
aa(lp112
V(Laughter)
p113
aa(lp114
VWhen my son was four in England \u2014
p115
aVActually, he was four everywhere, to be honest.
p116
aa(lp117
V(Laughter)
p118
aa(lp119
VIf we're being strict about it, wherever he went, he was four that year.
p120
aVHe was in the Nativity play. Do you remember the story?
p121
aa(lp122
V(Laughter)
p123
aa(lp124
VNo, it was big, it was a big story.
p125
aVMel Gibson did the sequel, you may have seen it.
p126
aa(lp127
V(Laughter)
p128
aa(lp129
V"Nativity II."
p130
aVBut James got the part of Joseph, which we were thrilled about.
p131
aVWe considered this to be one of the lead parts.
p132
aVWe had the place crammed full of agents in T-shirts:
p133
aV"James Robinson IS Joseph!" (Laughter)
p134
aVHe didn't have to speak,
p135
aVbut you know the bit where the three kings come in?
p136
aVThey come in bearing gifts, gold, frankincense and myrrh.
p137
aVThis really happened.
p138
aVWe were sitting there and I think they just went out of sequence,
p139
aVbecause we talked to the little boy afterward and we said,
p140
aV"You OK with that?" And he said, "Yeah, why? Was that wrong?"
p141
aVThey just switched.
p142
aVThe three boys came in,
p143
aVfour-year-olds with tea towels on their heads,
p144
aVand they put these boxes down,
p145
aVand the first boy said, "I bring you gold."
p146
aVAnd the second boy said, "I bring you myrrh."
p147
aVAnd the third boy said, "Frank sent this."
p148
aa(lp149
V(Laughter)
p150
aa(lp151
VWhat these things have in common is that kids will take a chance.
p152
aVIf they don't know, they'll have a go.
p153
aVAm I right? They're not frightened of being wrong.
p154
aVI don't mean to say that being wrong is the same thing as being creative.
p155
aVWhat we do know is, if you're not prepared to be wrong,
p156
aVyou'll never come up with anything original \u2014
p157
aVif you're not prepared to be wrong.
p158
aVAnd by the time they get to be adults, most kids have lost that capacity.
p159
aVThey have become frightened of being wrong.
p160
aVAnd we run our companies like this.
p161
aVWe stigmatize mistakes.
p162
aVAnd we're now running national education systems
p163
aVwhere mistakes are the worst thing you can make.
p164
aVAnd the result is that we are educating people
p165
aVout of their creative capacities.
p166
aa(lp167
VPicasso once said this, he said that all children are born artists.
p168
aVThe problem is to remain an artist as we grow up.
p169
aVI believe this passionately, that we don't grow into creativity,
p170
aVwe grow out of it.
p171
aVOr rather, we get educated out of it.
p172
aVSo why is this?
p173
aa(lp174
VI lived in Stratford-on-Avon until about five years ago.
p175
aVIn fact, we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles.
p176
aVSo you can imagine what a seamless transition that was.
p177
aa(lp178
V(Laughter)
p179
aa(lp180
VActually, we lived in a place called Snitterfield,
p181
aVjust outside Stratford,
p182
aVwhich is where Shakespeare's father was born.
p183
aVAre you struck by a new thought? I was.
p184
aVYou don't think of Shakespeare having a father, do you?
p185
aVDo you? Because you don't think of Shakespeare being a child, do you?
p186
aVShakespeare being seven?
p187
aVI never thought of it.
p188
aVI mean, he was seven at some point.
p189
aVHe was in somebody's English class, wasn't he?
p190
aa(lp191
V(Laughter)
p192
aa(lp193
VHow annoying would that be?
p194
aa(lp195
V(Laughter)
p196
aa(lp197
V"Must try harder."
p198
aa(lp199
V(Laughter)
p200
aa(lp201
VBeing sent to bed by his dad, you know, to Shakespeare, "Go to bed, now!
p202
aVAnd put the pencil down."
p203
aa(lp204
V(Laughter)
p205
aa(lp206
V"And stop speaking like that."
p207
aa(lp208
V(Laughter)
p209
aa(lp210
V"It's confusing everybody."
p211
aa(lp212
V(Laughter)
p213
aa(lp214
VAnyway, we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles,
p215
aVand I just want to say a word about the transition.
p216
aVMy son didn't want to come.
p217
aVI've got two kids; he's 21 now, my daughter's 16.
p218
aVHe didn't want to come to Los Angeles.
p219
aVHe loved it, but he had a girlfriend in England.
p220
aVThis was the love of his life, Sarah.
p221
aVHe'd known her for a month.
p222
aa(lp223
V(Laughter)
p224
aa(lp225
VMind you, they'd had their fourth anniversary,
p226
aVbecause it's a long time when you're 16.
p227
aVHe was really upset on the plane,
p228
aVhe said, "I'll never find another girl like Sarah."
p229
aVAnd we were rather pleased about that, frankly \u2014
p230
aa(lp231
V(Laughter)
p232
aa(lp233
VBecause she was the main reason we were leaving the country.
p234
aa(lp235
V(Laughter)
p236
aa(lp237
VBut something strikes you when you move to America
p238
aVand travel around the world:
p239
aVEvery education system on Earth has the same hierarchy of subjects.
p240
aVEvery one. Doesn't matter where you go.
p241
aVYou'd think it would be otherwise, but it isn't.
p242
aVAt the top are mathematics and languages,
p243
aVthen the humanities, and at the bottom are the arts.
p244
aVEverywhere on Earth.
p245
aVAnd in pretty much every system too, there's a hierarchy within the arts.
p246
aVArt and music are normally given a higher status in schools
p247
aVthan drama and dance.
p248
aVThere isn't an education system on the planet
p249
aVthat teaches dance everyday to children
p250
aVthe way we teach them mathematics. Why?
p251
aVWhy not? I think this is rather important.
p252
aVI think math is very important, but so is dance.
p253
aVChildren dance all the time if they're allowed to, we all do.
p254
aVWe all have bodies, don't we? Did I miss a meeting?
p255
aa(lp256
V(Laughter)
p257
aa(lp258
VTruthfully, what happens is, as children grow up,
p259
aVwe start to educate them progressively from the waist up.
p260
aVAnd then we focus on their heads.
p261
aVAnd slightly to one side.
p262
aa(lp263
VIf you were to visit education, as an alien,
p264
aVand say "What's it for, public education?"
p265
aVI think you'd have to conclude, if you look at the output,
p266
aVwho really succeeds by this,
p267
aVwho does everything that they should,
p268
aVwho gets all the brownie points, who are the winners \u2014
p269
aVI think you'd have to conclude the whole purpose of public education
p270
aVthroughout the world
p271
aVis to produce university professors.
p272
aVIsn't it?
p273
aVThey're the people who come out the top.
p274
aVAnd I used to be one, so there.
p275
aa(lp276
V(Laughter)
p277
aa(lp278
VAnd I like university professors, but you know,
p279
aVwe shouldn't hold them up
p280
aVas the high-water mark of all human achievement.
p281
aVThey're just a form of life,
p282
aVanother form of life.
p283
aVBut they're rather curious, and I say this out of affection for them.
p284
aVThere's something curious about professors in my experience \u2014
p285
aVnot all of them, but typically, they live in their heads.
p286
aVThey live up there, and slightly to one side.
p287
aVThey're disembodied, you know, in a kind of literal way.
p288
aVThey look upon their body as a form of transport for their heads.
p289
aa(lp290
V(Laughter)
p291
aa(lp292
VDon't they?
p293
aVIt's a way of getting their head to meetings.
p294
aa(lp295
V(Laughter)
p296
aa(lp297
VIf you want real evidence of out-of-body experiences,
p298
aVget yourself along to a residential conference of senior academics,
p299
aVand pop into the discotheque on the final night.
p300
aa(lp301
V(Laughter)
p302
aa(lp303
VAnd there, you will see it.
p304
aVGrown men and women writhing uncontrollably, off the beat.
p305
aa(lp306
V(Laughter)
p307
aa(lp308
VWaiting until it ends so they can go home and write a paper about it.
p309
aa(lp310
V(Laughter)
p311
aa(lp312
VOur education system is predicated on the idea of academic ability.
p313
aVAnd there's a reason.
p314
aVAround the world, there were no public systems of education,
p315
aVreally, before the 19th century.
p316
aVThey all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism.
p317
aVSo the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas.
p318
aa(lp319
VNumber one, that the most useful subjects for work are at the top.
p320
aVSo you were probably steered benignly away
p321
aVfrom things at school when you were a kid, things you liked,
p322
aVon the grounds that you would never get a job doing that. Is that right?
p323
aVDon't do music, you're not going to be a musician;
p324
aVdon't do art, you won't be an artist.
p325
aVBenign advice \u2014 now, profoundly mistaken.
p326
aVThe whole world is engulfed in a revolution.
p327
aa(lp328
VAnd the second is academic ability,
p329
aVwhich has really come to dominate our view of intelligence,
p330
aVbecause the universities designed the system in their image.
p331
aVIf you think of it, the whole system of public education around the world
p332
aVis a protracted process of university entrance.
p333
aVAnd the consequence is that many highly-talented,
p334
aVbrilliant, creative people think they're not,
p335
aVbecause the thing they were good at at school
p336
aVwasn't valued, or was actually stigmatized.
p337
aVAnd I think we can't afford to go on that way.
p338
aa(lp339
VIn the next 30 years, according to UNESCO,
p340
aVmore people worldwide will be graduating
p341
aVthrough education than since the beginning of history.
p342
aVMore people, and it's the combination of all the things we've talked about \u2014
p343
aVtechnology and its transformation effect on work, and demography
p344
aVand the huge explosion in population.
p345
aa(lp346
VSuddenly, degrees aren't worth anything.
p347
aVIsn't that true?
p348
aVWhen I was a student, if you had a degree, you had a job.
p349
aVIf you didn't have a job, it's because you didn't want one.
p350
aVAnd I didn't want one, frankly. (Laughter)
p351
aVBut now kids with degrees
p352
aVare often heading home to carry on playing video games,
p353
aVbecause you need an MA where the previous job required a BA,
p354
aVand now you need a PhD for the other.
p355
aVIt's a process of academic inflation.
p356
aVAnd it indicates the whole structure of education
p357
aVis shifting beneath our feet.
p358
aVWe need to radically rethink our view of intelligence.
p359
aa(lp360
VWe know three things about intelligence.
p361
aVOne, it's diverse.
p362
aVWe think about the world in all the ways that we experience it.
p363
aVWe think visually, we think in sound, we think kinesthetically.
p364
aVWe think in abstract terms, we think in movement.
p365
aVSecondly, intelligence is dynamic.
p366
aVIf you look at the interactions of a human brain,
p367
aVas we heard yesterday from a number of presentations,
p368
aVintelligence is wonderfully interactive.
p369
aVThe brain isn't divided into compartments.
p370
aVIn fact, creativity \u2014 which I define as the process
p371
aVof having original ideas that have value \u2014
p372
aVmore often than not comes about through the interaction
p373
aVof different disciplinary ways of seeing things.
p374
aa(lp375
VBy the way, there's a shaft of nerves that joins the two halves of the brain
p376
aVcalled the corpus callosum.
p377
aVIt's thicker in women.
p378
aVFollowing off from Helen yesterday,
p379
aVthis is probably why women are better at multi-tasking.
p380
aVBecause you are, aren't you?
p381
aVThere's a raft of research, but I know it from my personal life.
p382
aVIf my wife is cooking a meal at home \u2014 which is not often, thankfully.
p383
aa(lp384
V(Laughter)
p385
aa(lp386
VNo, she's good at some things, but if she's cooking,
p387
aVshe's dealing with people on the phone,
p388
aVshe's talking to the kids, she's painting the ceiling,
p389
aVshe's doing open-heart surgery over here.
p390
aVIf I'm cooking, the door is shut, the kids are out,
p391
aVthe phone's on the hook, if she comes in I get annoyed.
p392
aVI say, "Terry, please, I'm trying to fry an egg in here."
p393
aa(lp394
V(Laughter)
p395
aa(lp396
V"Give me a break."
p397
aa(lp398
V(Laughter)
p399
aa(lp400
VActually, do you know that old philosophical thing,
p401
aVif a tree falls in a forest and nobody hears it, did it happen?
p402
aVRemember that old chestnut?
p403
aVI saw a great t-shirt recently, which said,
p404
aV"If a man speaks his mind in a forest, and no woman hears him,
p405
aVis he still wrong?"
p406
aa(lp407
V(Laughter)
p408
aa(lp409
VAnd the third thing about intelligence is,
p410
aVit's distinct.
p411
aVI'm doing a new book at the moment called "Epiphany,"
p412
aVwhich is based on a series of interviews with people
p413
aVabout how they discovered their talent.
p414
aVI'm fascinated by how people got to be there.
p415
aVIt's really prompted by a conversation I had with a wonderful woman
p416
aVwho maybe most people have never heard of, Gillian Lynne.
p417
aVHave you heard of her? Some have.
p418
aVShe's a choreographer, and everybody knows her work.
p419
aVShe did "Cats" and "Phantom of the Opera."
p420
aVShe's wonderful.
p421
aVI used to be on the board of The Royal Ballet,
p422
aVas you can see.
p423
aVAnyway, Gillian and I had lunch one day and I said,
p424
aV"How did you get to be a dancer?"
p425
aVIt was interesting.
p426
aVWhen she was at school, she was really hopeless.
p427
aVAnd the school, in the '30s, wrote to her parents and said,
p428
aV"We think Gillian has a learning disorder."
p429
aVShe couldn't concentrate; she was fidgeting.
p430
aVI think now they'd say she had ADHD. Wouldn't you?
p431
aVBut this was the 1930s, and ADHD hadn't been invented at this point.
p432
aVIt wasn't an available condition.
p433
aa(lp434
V(Laughter)
p435
aa(lp436
VPeople weren't aware they could have that.
p437
aa(lp438
V(Laughter)
p439
aa(lp440
VAnyway, she went to see this specialist.
p441
aVSo, this oak-paneled room, and she was there with her mother,
p442
aVand she was led and sat on this chair at the end,
p443
aVand she sat on her hands for 20 minutes while this man talked to her mother
p444
aVabout the problems Gillian was having at school.
p445
aVBecause she was disturbing people; her homework was always late; and so on,
p446
aVlittle kid of eight.
p447
aVIn the end, the doctor went and sat next to Gillian, and said,
p448
aV"I've listened to all these things your mother's told me,
p449
aVI need to speak to her privately.
p450
aVWait here. We'll be back; we won't be very long,"
p451
aVand they went and left her.
p452
aa(lp453
VBut as they went out of the room,
p454
aVhe turned on the radio that was sitting on his desk.
p455
aVAnd when they got out, he said to her mother, "Just stand and watch her."
p456
aVAnd the minute they left the room,
p457
aVshe was on her feet, moving to the music.
p458
aVAnd they watched for a few minutes and he turned to her mother and said,
p459
aV"Mrs. Lynne, Gillian isn't sick; she's a dancer.
p460
aVTake her to a dance school."
p461
aa(lp462
VI said, "What happened?"
p463
aVShe said, "She did. I can't tell you how wonderful it was.
p464
aVWe walked in this room and it was full of people like me.
p465
aVPeople who couldn't sit still.
p466
aVPeople who had to move to think." Who had to move to think.
p467
aVThey did ballet, they did tap, jazz; they did modern; they did contemporary.
p468
aVShe was eventually auditioned for the Royal Ballet School;
p469
aVshe became a soloist; she had a wonderful career at the Royal Ballet.
p470
aVShe eventually graduated from the Royal Ballet School,
p471
aVfounded the Gillian Lynne Dance Company,
p472
aVmet Andrew Lloyd Webber.

VWhat I think it comes to is this:
p481
aVAl Gore spoke the other night
p482
aVabout ecology and the revolution that was triggered by Rachel Carson.
p483
aVI believe our only hope for the future
p484
aVis to adopt a new conception of human ecology,
p485
aVone in which we start to reconstitute our conception
p486
aVof the richness of human capacity.
p487
aVOur education system has mined our minds
p488
aVin the way that we strip-mine the earth: for a particular commodity.
p489
aVAnd for the future, it won't serve us.

p494
aV"If all the insects were to disappear from the Earth,

aVIf all human beings disappeared from the Earth,
p497
aVwithin 50 years all forms of life would flourish."

aVWe have to be careful now
p502
aVthat we use this gift wisely
p503
aVand that we avert some of the scenarios that we've talked about.
p504
aVAnd the only way we'll do it is by seeing our creative capacities
p505
aVfor the richness they are
p506
aVand seeing our children for the hope that they are.
p507
aVAnd our task is to educate their whole being,
p508
aVso they can face this future.
p509
aVBy the way \u2014 we may not see this future,

aVAnd our job is to help them make something of it.
