(lp3
VWell, as Alexander Graham Bell famously said
p4
aVon his first successful telephone call,
p5
aV"Hello, is that Domino's Pizza?"
p6
aV(Laughter)
p7
aVI just really want to thank you very much.
p8
aVAs another famous man, Jerry Garcia, said,
p9
aV"What a strange, long trip."
p10
aVAnd he should have said,
p11
aV"What a strange, long trip it's about to become."
p12
aVAt this very moment, you are viewing my upper half.
p13
aVMy lower half is appearing at a different conference
p14
aV(Laughter)
p15
aVin a different country.
p16
aVYou can, it turns out, be in two places at once.
p17
aVBut still, I'm sorry I can't be with you in person.
p18
aVI'll explain at another time.
p19
aa(lp20
VAnd though I'm a rock star,
p21
aVI just want to assure you that none of my wishes will include a hot tub.
p22
aVBut what really turns me on about technology
p23
aVis not just the ability to get more songs on MP3 players.
p24
aVThe revolution \u2014 this revolution \u2014 is much bigger than that.
p25
aVI hope, I believe.
p26
aVWhat turns me on about the digital age,
p27
aVwhat excites me personally,
p28
aVis that you have closed the gap between dreaming and doing.
p29
aVYou see, it used to be that if you wanted to make a record of a song,
p30
aVyou needed a studio and a producer.
p31
aVNow, you need a laptop.
p32
aVIf you wanted to make a film, you needed a mass of equipment
p33
aVand a Hollywood budget.
p34
aVNow, you need a camera that fits in your palm,
p35
aVand a couple of bucks for a blank DVD.
p36
aVImagination has been decoupled from the old constraints.
p37
aVAnd that really, really excites me.
p38
aVI'm excited when I glimpse that kind of thinking writ large.
p39
aa(lp40
VWhat I would like to see is idealism decoupled from all constraints.
p41
aVPolitical, economic, psychological, whatever.
p42
aVThe geopolitical world has got a lot to learn from the digital world.
p43
aVFrom the ease with which you swept away obstacles
p44
aVthat no one knew could even be budged.
p45
aVAnd that's actually what I'd like to talk about today.
p46
aVFirst, though, I should probably explain why, and how,
p47
aVI got to this place.
p48
aVIt's a journey that started 20 years ago.
p49
aVYou may remember that song, "We Are the World,"
p50
aVor, "Do They Know It's Christmas?"
p51
aVBand Aid, Live Aid.
p52
aVAnother very tall, grizzled rock star, my friend Sir Bob Geldof,
p53
aVissued a challenge to "feed the world."
p54
aVIt was a great moment, and it utterly changed my life.
p55
aVThat summer, my wife, Ali, and myself went to Ethiopia.
p56
aVWe went on the quiet to see for ourselves what was going on.
p57
aVWe lived in Ethiopia for a month, working at an orphanage.
p58
aVThe children had a name for me.
p59
aVThey called me, "The girl with the beard."
p60
aa(lp61
V(Laughter)
p62
aa(lp63
VDon't ask.
p64
aVAnyway, we found Africa to be a magical place.
p65
aVBig skies, big hearts, big, shining continent.
p66
aVBeautiful, royal people.
p67
aVAnybody who ever gave anything to Africa got a lot more back.
p68
aVEthiopia didn't just blow my mind; it opened my mind.
p69
aVAnyway, on our last day at this orphanage
p70
aVa man handed me his baby and said,
p71
aV"Would you take my son with you?"
p72
aVHe knew, in Ireland, that his son would live,
p73
aVand that in Ethiopia, his son would die.
p74
aVIt was the middle of that awful famine.
p75
aVWell, I turned him down.
p76
aVAnd it was a funny kind of sick feeling, but I turned him down.
p77
aVAnd it's a feeling I can't ever quite forget.
p78
aVAnd in that moment, I started this journey.
p79
aa(lp80
VIn that moment, I became the worst thing of all:
p81
aVI became a rock star with a cause. (Laughter)
p82
aVExcept this isn't the cause, is it?
p83
aVSix-and-a-half thousand Africans dying every single day from AIDS \u2014
p84
aVa preventable, treatable disease \u2014
p85
aVfor lack of drugs we can get in any pharmacy.
p86
aVThat's not a cause. That's an emergency.
p87
aV11 million AIDS orphans in Africa,
p88
aV20 million by the end of the decade.
p89
aVThat's not a cause. That's an emergency.
p90
aVToday, every day, 9,000 more Africans
p91
aVwill catch HIV because of stigmatization and lack of education.
p92
aVThat's not a cause. That's an emergency.
p93
aVSo what we're talking about here is human rights.
p94
aVThe right to live like a human.
p95
aVThe right to live, period.
p96
aVAnd what we're facing in Africa is
p97
aVan unprecedented threat to human dignity and equality.
p98
aa(lp99
VThe next thing I'd like to be clear about is what this problem is,
p100
aVand what this problem isn't.
p101
aVBecause this is not all about charity.
p102
aVThis is about justice. Really.
p103
aVThis is not about charity. This is about justice.
p104
aVThat's right.
p105
aVAnd that's too bad, because we're very good at charity.
p106
aVAmericans, like Irish people, are good at it.
p107
aVEven the poorest neighborhoods give more than they can afford.
p108
aVWe like to give, and we give a lot.
p109
aVLook at the response to the tsunami \u2014 it's inspiring.
p110
aVBut justice is a tougher standard than charity.
p111
aVYou see, Africa makes a fool of our idea of justice.
p112
aVIt makes a farce of our idea of equality.
p113
aVIt mocks our pieties. It doubts our concern.
p114
aVIt questions our commitment.
p115
aVBecause there is no way we can look at what's happening in Africa,
p116
aVand if we're honest,
p117
aVconclude that it would ever be allowed to happen anywhere else.
p118
aa(lp119
VAs you heard in the film, anywhere else, not here.
p120
aVNot here, not in America, not in Europe.
p121
aVIn fact, a head of state that you're all familiar with
p122
aVadmitted this to me. And it's really true.
p123
aVThere is no chance this kind of hemorrhaging of human life
p124
aVwould be accepted anywhere else other than Africa.
p125
aVAfrica is a continent in flames.
p126
aVAnd deep down, if we really accepted that Africans were equal to us,
p127
aVwe would all do more to put the fire out.
p128
aVWe're standing around with watering cans,
p129
aVwhen what we really need is the fire brigade.
p130
aa(lp131
VYou see, it's not as dramatic as the tsunami.
p132
aVIt's crazy, really, when you think about it.
p133
aVDoes stuff have to look like an action movie these days
p134
aVto exist in the front of our brain?
p135
aVThe slow extinguishing of countless lives
p136
aVis just not dramatic enough, it would appear.
p137
aVCatastrophes that we can avert
p138
aVare not as interesting as ones we could avert.
p139
aVFunny, that.
p140
aVAnyway, I believe that that kind of thinking
p141
aVoffends the intellectual rigor in this room.
p142
aVSix-and-a-half thousand people dying a day in Africa may be Africa's crisis,
p143
aVbut the fact that it's not on the nightly news,
p144
aVthat we in Europe, or you in America,
p145
aVare not treating it like an emergency \u2014
p146
aVI want to argue with you tonight that that's our crisis.
p147
aVI want to argue that though Africa is not the front line in the war against terror,
p148
aVit could be soon.
p149
aVEvery week, religious extremists take another African village.
p150
aVThey're attempting to bring order to chaos.
p151
aVWell, why aren't we?
p152
aa(lp153
VPoverty breeds despair. We know this.
p154
aVDespair breeds violence. We know this.
p155
aVIn turbulent times, isn't it cheaper, and smarter,
p156
aVto make friends out of potential enemies
p157
aVthan to defend yourself against them later?
p158
aV"The war against terror is bound up in the war against poverty."
p159
aVAnd I didn't say that. Colin Powell said that.
p160
aVNow when the military are telling us that this is a war
p161
aVthat cannot be won by military might alone,
p162
aVmaybe we should listen.
p163
aVThere's an opportunity here, and it's real.
p164
aVIt's not spin. It's not wishful thinking.
p165
aVThe problems facing the developing world
p166
aVafford us in the developed world
p167
aVa chance to re-describe ourselves to the world.
p168
aVWe will not only transform other people's lives,
p169
aVbut we will also transform the way those other lives see us.
p170
aVAnd that might be smart in these nervous, dangerous times.
p171
aa(lp172
VDon't you think that on a purely commercial level,
p173
aVthat anti-retroviral drugs are great advertisements
p174
aVfor Western ingenuity and technology?
p175
aVDoesn't compassion look well on us?
p176
aVAnd let's cut the crap for a second.
p177
aVIn certain quarters of the world, brand EU, brand USA,
p178
aVis not at its shiniest.
p179
aVThe neon sign is fizzing and cracking.
p180
aVSomeone's put a brick through the window.
p181
aVThe regional branch managers are getting nervous.
p182
aVNever before have we in the west been so scrutinized.
p183
aVOur values: do we have any?
p184
aVOur credibility?
p185
aVThese things are under attack around the world.
p186
aVBrand USA could use some polishing.
p187
aVAnd I say that as a fan, you know?
p188
aVAs a person who buys the products.
p189
aVBut think about it.
p190
aVMore anti-retrovirals make sense.
p191
aVBut that's just the easy part, or ought to be.
p192
aa(lp193
VBut equality for Africa \u2014
p194
aVthat's a big, expensive idea.
p195
aVYou see, the scale of the suffering numbs us into a kind of indifference.
p196
aVWhat on earth can we all do about this?
p197
aVWell, much more than we think.
p198
aVWe can't fix every problem, but the ones we can,
p199
aVI want to argue, we must.
p200
aVAnd because we can, we must.
p201
aVThis is the straight truth, the righteous truth.
p202
aVIt is not a theory.
p203
aVThe fact is that ours is the first generation
p204
aVthat can look disease and extreme poverty in the eye,
p205
aVlook across the ocean to Africa, and say this, and mean it:
p206
aVwe do not have to stand for this.
p207
aVA whole continent written off \u2014 we do not have to stand for this.
p208
aa(lp209
V(Applause)
p210
aa(lp211
VAnd let me say this without a trace of irony \u2014
p212
aVbefore I back it up to a bunch of ex-hippies.
p213
aVForget the '60s. We can change the world.
p214
aVI can't; you can't, as individuals; but we can change the world.
p215
aVI really believe that, the people in this room.
p216
aVLook at the Gates Foundation.
p217
aVThey've done incredible stuff, unbelievable stuff.
p218
aVBut working together, we can actually change the world.
p219
aVWe can turn the inevitable outcomes,
p220
aVand transform the quality of life for millions of lives
p221
aVwho look and feel rather like us, when you're up close.
p222
aVI'm sorry to laugh here, but you do look so different
p223
aVthan you did in Haight-Ashbury in the '60s.
p224
aa(lp225
V(Laughter)
p226
aa(lp227
VBut I want to argue that this is the moment that you are designed for.
p228
aVIt is the flowering of the seeds you planted
p229
aVin earlier, headier days.
p230
aVIdeas that you gestated in your youth.
p231
aVThis is what excites me.
p232
aVThis room was born for this moment,
p233
aVis really what I want to say to you tonight.
p234
aVMost of you started out wanting to change the world, didn't you?
p235
aVMost of you did, the digital world.
p236
aVWell, now, actually because of you,
p237
aVit is possible to change the physical world.
p238
aVIt's a fact.
p239
aVEconomists confirm it, and they know much more than I do.
p240
aVSo why, then, are we not pumping our fists into the air?
p241
aVProbably because when we admit we can do something about it,
p242
aVwe've got to do something about it.
p243
aVIt is a pain in the arse.
p244
aVThis equality business is actually a pain in the arse.
p245
aVBut for the first time in history, we have the technology;
p246
aVwe have the know-how; we have the cash;
p247
aVwe have the life-saving drugs.
p248
aa(lp249
VDo we have the will?
p250
aVI hope this is obvious, but I'm not a hippie.
p251
aVAnd I'm not really one for the warm, fuzzy feeling.
p252
aVI do not have flowers in my hair.
p253
aVActually, I come from punk rock.
p254
aVThe Clash wore big army boots, not sandals.
p255
aVBut I know toughness when I see it.
p256
aVAnd for all the talk of peace and love on the West Coast,
p257
aVthere was muscle to the movement that started out here.
p258
aVYou see, idealism detached from action is just a dream.
p259
aVBut idealism allied with pragmatism,
p260
aVwith rolling up your sleeves and making the world bend a bit,
p261
aVis very exciting. It's very real. It's very strong.
p262
aVAnd it's very present in a crowd like you.
p263
aa(lp264
VLast year at DATA, this organization I helped set up,
p265
aVwe launched a campaign to summon this spirit
p266
aVin the fight against AIDS and extreme poverty.
p267
aVWe're calling it the ONE Campaign.
p268
aVIt's based on our belief that the action of one person
p269
aVcan change a lot,
p270
aVbut the actions of many coming together as one
p271
aVcan change the world.
p272
aVWell, we feel that now is the time to prove we're right.
p273
aVThere are moments in history when civilization redefines itself.
p274
aVWe believe this is one.
p275
aVWe believe that this could be the time when the world finally decides
p276
aVthat the wanton loss of life in Africa is just no longer acceptable.
p277
aVThis could be the time that we finally get serious
p278
aVabout changing the future for most people who live on planet Earth.
p279
aa(lp280
VMomentum has been building.
p281
aVLurching a little, but it's building.
p282
aVThis year is a test for us all,
p283
aVespecially the leaders of the G8 nations,
p284
aVwho really are on the line here,
p285
aVwith all the world in history watching.
p286
aVI have been, of late, disappointed with the Bush Administration.
p287
aVThey started out with such promise on Africa.
p288
aVThey made some really great promises,
p289
aVand actually have fulfilled a lot of them.
p290
aVBut some of them they haven't.
p291
aVThey don't feel the push from the ground, is the truth.
p292
aVBut my disappointment has much more perspective
p293
aVwhen I talk to American people,
p294
aVand I hear their worries about the deficit,
p295
aVand the fiscal well being of their country.
p296
aVI understand that.
p297
aVBut there's much more push from the ground than you'd think,
p298
aVif we got organized.
p299
aa(lp300
VWhat I try to communicate, and you can help me if you agree,
p301
aVis that aid for Africa is just great value for money
p302
aVat a time when America really needs it.
p303
aVPutting it in the crassest possible terms,
p304
aVthe investment reaps huge returns.
p305
aVNot only in lives saved, but in goodwill, stability
p306
aVand security that we'll gain.
p307
aVSo this is what I hope that you will do, if I could be so bold,
p308
aVand not have it deducted from my number of wishes.
p309
aa(lp310
V(Laughter)
p311
aa(lp312
VWhat I hope is that beyond individual merciful acts,
p313
aVthat you will tell the politicians to do right by Africa,
p314
aVby America and by the world.
p315
aVGive them permission, if you like,
p316
aVto spend their political capital and your financial capital,
p317
aVyour national purse on saving the lives of millions of people.
p318
aVThat's really what I would like you to do.
p319
aVBecause we also need your intellectual capital:
p320
aVyour ideas, your skills, your ingenuity.
p321
aVAnd you, at this conference, are in a unique position.
p322
aVSome of the technologies we've been talking about, you invented them,
p323
aVor at least revolutionized the way that they're used.
p324
aVTogether you have changed the zeitgeist from analog to digital,
p325
aVand pushed the boundaries.
p326
aVAnd we'd like you to give us that energy.
p327
aVGive us that kind of dreaming, that kind of doing.
p328
aa(lp329
VAs I say, there're two things on the line here.
p330
aVThere's the continent Africa.
p331
aVBut there's also our sense of ourselves.
p332
aVPeople are starting to figure this out.
p333
aVMovements are springing up.
p334
aVArtists, politicians, pop stars, priests, CEOs,
p335
aVNGOs, mothers' unions, student unions.
p336
aVA lot of people are getting together, and working
p337
aVunder this umbrella I told you about earlier, the ONE Campaign.
p338
aVI think they just have one idea in their mind,
p339
aVwhich is, where you live in the world
p340
aVshould not determine whether you live in the world.
p341
aa(lp342
V(Applause)
p343
aa(lp344
VHistory, like God, is watching what we do.
p345
aVWhen the history books get written,
p346
aVI think our age will be remembered for three things.
p347
aVReally, it's just three things this whole age will be remembered for.
p348
aVThe digital revolution, yes.
p349
aVThe war against terror, yes.
p350
aVAnd what we did or did not do to put out the fires in Africa.
p351
aVSome say we can't afford to. I say we can't afford not to.
p352
aVThank you, thank you very much.
p353
aa(lp354
V(Applause)
p355
aa(lp356
VOkay, my three wishes.
p357
aVThe ones that TED has offered to grant.
p358
aVYou see, if this is true, and I believe it is,
p359
aVthat the digital world you all created has uncoupled
p360
aVthe creative imagination from the physical constraints of matter,
p361
aVthis should be a piece of piss.
p362
aa(lp363
V(Laughter)
p364
aa(lp365
VI should add that this started out as a much longer list of wishes.
p366
aVMost of them impossible, some of them impractical
p367
aVand one or two of them certainly immoral.
p368
aa(lp369
V(Laughter)
p370
aa(lp371
VThis business, it gets to be addictive, you know what I mean,
p372
aVwhen somebody else is picking up the tab.
p373
aVAnyway, here's number one.
p374
aVI wish for you to help build a social movement
p375
aVof more than one million American activists for Africa.
p376
aVThat is my first wish.
p377
aVI believe it's possible.
p378
aVA few minutes ago, I talked about all the citizens' campaigns that are springing up.
p379
aVYou know, there's lots out there.
p380
aVAnd with this one campaign as our umbrella,
p381
aVmy organization, DATA, and other groups,
p382
aVhave been tapping into the energy and the enthusiasm
p383
aVthat's out there from Hollywood into the heartland of America.
p384
aVWe know there's more than enough energy to power this movement.
p385
aVWe just need your help in making it happen.
p386
aa(lp387
VWe want all of you here, church America, corporate America,
p388
aVMicrosoft America, Apple America, Coke America,
p389
aVPepsi America, nerd America, noisy America.
p390
aVWe can't afford to be cool and sit this one out.
p391
aVI do believe if we build a movement that's one million Americans strong,
p392
aVwe're not going to be denied.
p393
aVWe will have the ear of Congress.
p394
aVWe'll be the first page in Condi Rice's briefing book,
p395
aVand right into the Oval Office.
p396
aVIf there's one million Americans \u2014 and I really know this \u2014
p397
aVwho are ready to make phone calls,
p398
aVwho are ready to be on email,
p399
aVI am absolutely sure that we can actually change
p400
aVthe course of history, literally, for the continent of Africa.
p401
aVAnyway, so I'd like your help in getting that signed up.
p402
aVI know John Gage and Sun Microsystems are already on board for this,
p403
aVbut there's lots of you we'd like to talk to.
p404
aa(lp405
VRight, my second wish, number two.
p406
aVI would like one media hit for every person on the planet
p407
aVwho is living on less than one dollar a day.
p408
aVThat's one billion media hits.
p409
aVCould be on Google, could be on AOL.
p410
aVSteve Case, Larry, Sergey \u2014 they've done a lot already.
p411
aVIt could be NBC. It could be ABC.
p412
aVActually we're talking to ABC today about the Oscars.
p413
aVWe have a film, produced by Jon Kamen at Radical Media.
p414
aVBut you know, we want, we need some airtime for our ideas.
p415
aVWe need to get the math; we need to get the statistics out to the American people.
p416
aVI really believe that old Truman line,
p417
aVthat if you give the American people the facts,
p418
aVthey'll do the right thing.
p419
aVAnd, the other thing that's important is that this is not Sally Struthers.
p420
aVThis has to be described as an adventure, not a burden.
p421
aa(lp422
V(Video): One by one they step forward,
p423
aVa nurse, a teacher, a homemaker,
p424
aVand lives are saved.
p425
aVThe problem is enormous.
p426
aVEvery three seconds one person dies.
p427
aVAnother three seconds, one more.
p428
aVThe situation is so desperate in parts of Africa,
p429
aVAsia, even America,
p430
aVthat aid groups, just as they did for the tsunami,
p431
aVare uniting as one, acting as one.
p432
aVWe can beat extreme poverty, starvation, AIDS.
p433
aVBut we need your help.
p434
aVOne more person, letter, voice
p435
aVwill mean the difference between life and death
p436
aVfor millions of people.
p437
aVPlease join us by working together.
p438
aVAmericans have an unprecedented opportunity.
p439
aVWe can make history.
p440
aVWe can start to make poverty history.
p441
aVOne, by one, by one.
p442
aVPlease visit ONE at this address.

VBono: All right. I wish for TED to truly show the power of information,
p446
aVits power to rewrite the rules and transform lives,
p447
aVby connecting every hospital, health clinic and school
p448
aVin one African country.
p449
aVAnd I would like it to be Ethiopia.
p450
aVI believe we can connect every school in Ethiopia,
p451
aVevery health clinic, every hospital \u2014
p452
aVwe can connect to the Internet.
p453
aVThat is my wish, my third wish.
p454
aVI think it's possible.
p455
aVI think we have the money and brains in the room to do that.
p456
aVAnd that would be a mind-blowing wish to come true.
p457
aVI've been to Ethiopia, as I said earlier.
p458
aVIt's actually where it all started for me.
p459
aVThe idea that the Internet, which changed all of our lives,
p460
aVcan transform a country \u2014 and a continent
p461
aVthat has hardly made it to analog, let alone digital \u2014 blows my mind.
p462
aVBut it didn't start out that way.
p463
aa(lp464
VThe first long-distance line from Boston to New York
p465
aVwas used in 1885 on the phone.
p466
aVIt was just nine years later that Addis Ababa
p467
aVwas connected by phone to Harare, which is 500 kilometers away.
p468
aVSince then, not that much has changed.
p469
aVThe average waiting time to get a landline in Ethiopia
p470
aVis actually about seven or eight years.
p471
aVBut wireless technology wasn't dreamt up then.
p472
aVAnyway, I'm Irish, and as you can see,
p473
aVI know how important talking is.
p474
aVCommunication is very important for Ethiopia \u2014 will transform the country.
p475
aVNurses getting better training,
p476
aVpharmacists being able to order supplies,
p477
aVdoctors sharing their expertise in all aspects of medicine.
p478
aVIt's a very, very good idea to get them wired.
p479
aVAnd that is my third and final wish for you at the TED conference.
p480
aVThank you very much once again.
