VSo, indeed, I have spent my life
p4
aVlooking into the lives of presidents who are no longer alive.
p5
aVWaking up with Abraham Lincoln in the morning,
p6
aVthinking of Franklin Roosevelt when I went to bed at night.
p7
aVBut when I try and think about what I've learned
p8
aVabout the meaning in life, my mind keeps wandering back
p9
aVto a seminar that I took when I was a graduate student at Harvard
p10
aVwith the great psychologist Erik Erikson.
p11
aa(lp12
VHe taught us that the richest and fullest lives
p13
aVattempt to achieve an inner balance between three realms:
p14
aVwork, love and play.
p15
aVAnd that to pursue one realm to the disregard of the other,
p16
aVis to open oneself to ultimate sadness in older age.
p17
aVWhereas to pursue all three with equal dedication,
p18
aVis to make possible a life filled not only with achievement,
p19
aVbut with serenity.
p20
aa(lp21
VSo since I tell stories, let me look back
p22
aVon the lives of two of the presidents I've studied to illustrate this point \u2014
p23
aVAbraham Lincoln and Lyndon Johnson.
p24
aVAs for that first sphere of work,
p25
aVI think what Abraham Lincoln's life suggests
p26
aVis that fierce ambition is a good thing.
p27
aVHe had a huge ambition.
p28
aVBut it wasn't simply for office or power or celebrity or fame \u2014
p29
aVwhat it was for was to accomplish something worthy enough in life
p30
aVso that he could make the world a little better place for his having lived in it.
p31
aa(lp32
VEven as a child, it seemed, Lincoln dreamed heroic dreams.
p33
aVHe somehow had to escape that hard-scrabble farm
p34
aVfrom which he was born.
p35
aVNo schooling was possible for him,
p36
aVexcept a few weeks here, a few weeks there.
p37
aVBut he read books in every spare moment he could find.
p38
aVIt was said when he got a copy of the King James Bible
p39
aVor "Aesop's Fables," he was so excited he couldn't sleep.
p40
aVHe couldn't eat.
p41
aVThe great poet Emily Dickinson once said,
p42
aV"There is no frigate like a book to take us lands away."
p43
aVHow true for Lincoln.
p44
aa(lp45
VThough he never would travel to Europe,
p46
aVhe went with Shakespeare's kings to merry England,
p47
aVhe went with Lord Byron's poetry to Spain and Portugal.
p48
aVLiterature allowed him to transcend his surroundings.
p49
aVBut there were so many losses in his early life
p50
aVthat he was haunted by death.
p51
aVHis mother died when he was only nine years old;
p52
aVhis only sister, Sarah, in childbirth a few years later;
p53
aVand his first love, Ann Rutledge, at the age of 22.
p54
aVMoreover, when his mother lay dying,
p55
aVshe did not hold out for him the hope
p56
aVthat they would meet in an afterworld.
p57
aVShe simply said to him,
p58
aV"Abraham, I'm going away from you now, and I shall never return."
p59
aVAs a result he became obsessed with the thought
p60
aVthat when we die our life is swept away \u2014 dust to dust.
p61
aa(lp62
VBut only as he grew older did he develop
p63
aVa certain consolation from an ancient Greek notion \u2014
p64
aVbut followed by other cultures as well \u2014
p65
aVthat if you could accomplish something worthy in your life,
p66
aVyou could live on in the memory of others.
p67
aVYour honor and your reputation would outlive your earthly existence.
p68
aVAnd that worthy ambition became his lodestar.
p69
aVIt carried him through the one significant depression that he suffered
p70
aVwhen he was in his early 30s.
p71
aa(lp72
VThree things had combined to lay him low.
p73
aVHe had broken his engagement with Mary Todd,
p74
aVnot certain he was ready to marry her,
p75
aVbut knowing how devastating it was to her that he did that.
p76
aVHis one intimate friend, Joshua Speed, was leaving Illinois
p77
aVto go back to Kentucky because Speed's father had died.
p78
aVAnd his political career in the state legislature
p79
aVwas on a downward slide.
p80
aVHe was so depressed that friends worried he was suicidal.
p81
aVThey took all knives and razors and scissors from his room.
p82
aVAnd his great friend Speed went to his side and said,
p83
aV"Lincoln, you must rally or you will die."
p84
aVHe said that, "I would just as soon die right now,
p85
aVbut I've not yet done anything to make any human being
p86
aVremember that I have lived."
p87
aa(lp88
VSo fueled by that ambition, he returned to the state legislature.
p89
aVHe eventually won a seat in Congress.
p90
aVHe then ran twice for the Senate, lost twice.
p91
aV"Everyone is broken by life," Ernest Hemingway once said,
p92
aV"but some people are stronger in the broken places."
p93
aVSo then he surprised the nation with an upset victory
p94
aVfor the presidency over three far more experienced,
p95
aVfar more educated, far more celebrated rivals.
p96
aVAnd then when he won the general election,
p97
aVhe stunned the nation even more
p98
aVby appointing each of these three rivals into his Cabinet.
p99
aVIt was an unprecedented act at the time because everybody thought,
p100
aV"He'll look like a figurehead compared to these people."
p101
aVThey said, "Why are you doing this, Lincoln?"
p102
aVHe said, "Look, these are the strongest
p103
aVand most able men in the country.
p104
aVThe country is in peril. I need them by my side."
p105
aVBut perhaps my old friend Lyndon Johnson
p106
aVmight have put it in less noble fashion:
p107
aV"Better to have your enemies inside the tent pissing out,
p108
aVthan outside the tent pissing in."
p109
aV(Laughter)
p110
aa(lp111
VBut it soon became clear that Abraham Lincoln
p112
aVwould emerge as the undisputed captain of this unruly team.
p113
aVFor each of them soon came to understand
p114
aVthat he possessed an unparalleled array of
p115
aVemotional strengths and political skills
p116
aVthat proved far more important than the thinness of his external résumé.
p117
aVFor one thing, he possessed an uncanny ability
p118
aVto empathize with and to think about other peoples' point of view.
p119
aVHe repaired injured feelings that might have escalated
p120
aVinto permanent hostility.
p121
aVHe shared credit with ease,
p122
aVassumed responsibility for the failure of his subordinates,
p123
aVconstantly acknowledged his errors and learned from his mistakes.
p124
aVThese are the qualities we should be looking for in our candidates in 2008.
p125
aV(Applause)
p126
aVHe refused to be provoked by petty grievances.
p127
aVHe never submitted to jealousy or brooded over perceived slights.
p128
aVAnd he expressed his unshakeable convictions
p129
aVin everyday language, in metaphors, in stories.
p130
aVAnd with a beauty of language \u2014 almost as if
p131
aVthe Shakespeare and the poetry he had so loved as a child
p132
aVhad worked their way into his very soul.
p133
aa(lp134
VIn 1863, when the Emancipation Proclamation was signed,
p135
aVhe brought his old friend, Joshua Speed, back to the White House,
p136
aVand remembered that conversation of decades before, when he was so sad.
p137
aVAnd he, pointing to the Proclamation, said,
p138
aV"I believe, in this measure, my fondest hopes will be realized."
p139
aVBut as he was about to put his signature on the Proclamation
p140
aVhis own hand was numb and shaking
p141
aVbecause he had shaken a thousand hands that morning at a New Year's reception.
p142
aVSo he put the pen down.
p143
aVHe said, "If ever my soul were in an act, it is in this act.
p144
aVBut if I sign with a shaking hand,
p145
aVposterity will say, 'He hesitated.'"
p146
aVSo he waited until he could take up the pen
p147
aVand sign with a bold and clear hand.
p148
aVBut even in his wildest dreams,
p149
aVLincoln could never have imagined
p150
aVhow far his reputation would reach.
p151
aa(lp152
VI was so thrilled to find an interview with the great Russian writer,
p153
aVLeo Tolstoy, in a New York newspaper in the early 1900s.
p154
aVAnd in it, Tolstoy told of a trip that he'd recently made
p155
aVto a very remote area of the Caucasus,
p156
aVwhere there were only wild barbarians,
p157
aVwho had never left this part of Russia.
p158
aVKnowing that Tolstoy was in their midst,
p159
aVthey asked him to tell stories of the great men of history.
p160
aVSo he said, "I told them about Napoleon
p161
aVand Alexander the Great and Frederick the Great
p162
aVand Julius Caesar, and they loved it.
p163
aVBut before I finished, the chief of the barbarians stood up and said,
p164
aV'But wait, you haven't told us about the greatest ruler of them all.
p165
aVWe want to hear about that man who spoke with a voice of thunder,
p166
aVwho laughed like the sunrise,
p167
aVwho came from that place called America, which is so far from here,
p168
aVthat if a young man should travel there,
p169
aVhe would be an old man when he arrived.
p170
aVTell us of that man. Tell us of Abraham Lincoln.'"
p171
aVHe was stunned.
p172
aVHe told them everything he could about Lincoln.
p173
aVAnd then in the interview he said, "What made Lincoln so great?
p174
aVNot as great a general as Napoleon,
p175
aVnot as great a statesman as Frederick the Great."
p176
aVBut his greatness consisted, and historians would roundly agree,
p177
aVin the integrity of his character
p178
aVand the moral fiber of his being.
p179
aa(lp180
VSo in the end that powerful ambition
p181
aVthat had carried Lincoln through his bleak childhood had been realized.
p182
aVThat ambition that had allowed him to laboriously educate himself by himself,
p183
aVto go through that string of political failures
p184
aVand the darkest days of the war.
p185
aVHis story would be told.
p186
aVSo as for that second sphere, not of work, but of love \u2014
p187
aVencompassing family, friends and colleagues \u2014
p188
aVit, too, takes work and commitment.
p189
aVThe Lyndon Johnson that I saw in the last years of his life,
p190
aVwhen I helped him on his memoirs,
p191
aVwas a man who had spent so many years in the pursuit of
p192
aVwork, power and individual success,
p193
aVthat he had absolutely no psychic or emotional resources left
p194
aVto get him through the days
p195
aVonce the presidency was gone.
p196
aa(lp197
VMy relationship with him began on a rather curious level.
p198
aVI was selected as a White House Fellow when I was 24 years old.
p199
aVWe had a big dance at the White House.
p200
aVPresident Johnson did dance with me that night.
p201
aVNot that peculiar \u2014
p202
aVthere were only three women out of the 16 White House Fellows.
p203
aVBut he did whisper in my ear that he wanted me
p204
aVto work directly for him in the White House.
p205
aVBut it was not to be that simple.
p206
aVFor in the months leading up to my selection,
p207
aVlike many young people, I'd been active
p208
aVin the anti-Vietnam War movement,
p209
aVand had written an article against Lyndon Johnson,
p210
aVwhich unfortunately came out in The New Republic
p211
aVtwo days after the dance in the White House.
p212
aV(Laugher)
p213
aVAnd the theme of the article was how to remove Lyndon Johnson from power.
p214
aV(Laughter)
p215
aVSo I was certain he would kick me out of the program.
p216
aVBut instead, surprisingly, he said,
p217
aV"Oh, bring her down here for a year,
p218
aVand if I can't win her over, no one can."
p219
aVSo I did end up working for him in the White House.
p220
aVEventually accompanied him to his ranch to help him on those memoirs,
p221
aVnever fully understanding why he'd chosen me to spend so many hours with.
p222
aa(lp223
VI like to believe it was because I was a good listener.
p224
aVHe was a great storyteller.
p225
aVFabulous, colorful, anecdotal stories.
p226
aVThere was a problem with these stories, however,
p227
aVwhich I later discovered, which is that half of them weren't true.
p228
aVBut they were great, nonetheless.
p229
aV(Laughter)
p230
aVSo I think that part of his attraction for me was that I loved listening to his tall tales.
p231
aVBut I also worried that part of it was that I was then a young woman.
p232
aVAnd he had somewhat of a minor league womanizing reputation.
p233
aVSo I constantly chatted to him about boyfriends,
p234
aVeven when I didn't have any at all.
p235
aa(lp236
VEverything was working perfectly,
p237
aVuntil one day he said he wanted to discuss our relationship.
p238
aVSounded very ominous when he took me nearby to the lake,
p239
aVconveniently called Lake Lyndon Baines Johnson.
p240
aVAnd there was wine and cheese and a red-checked tablecloth \u2014
p241
aVall the romantic trappings.
p242
aVAnd he started out,
p243
aV"Doris, more than any other woman I have ever known ... "
p244
aVAnd my heart sank.
p245
aVAnd then he said,
p246
aV"You remind me of my mother."
p247
aV(Laughter)
p248
aa(lp249
VIt was pretty embarrassing, given what was going on in my mind.
p250
aVBut I must say, the older I've gotten,
p251
aVthe more I realize what an incredible privilege it was
p252
aVto have spent so many hours with this aging lion of a man.
p253
aVA victor in a thousand contests,
p254
aVthree great civil rights laws, Medicare, aid to education.
p255
aVAnd yet, roundly defeated in the end by the war in Vietnam.
p256
aVAnd because he was so sad and so vulnerable,
p257
aVhe opened up to me in ways he never would have
p258
aVhad I known him at the height of his power \u2014
p259
aVsharing his fears, his sorrows and his worries.
p260
aVAnd I'd like to believe that the privilege fired within me
p261
aVthe drive to understand the inner person behind the public figure,
p262
aVthat I've tried to bring to each of my books since then.
p263
aa(lp264
VBut it also brought home to me the lessons
p265
aVwhich Erik Erikson had tried to instill in all of us
p266
aVabout the importance of finding balance in life.
p267
aVFor on the surface, Lyndon Johnson should have had
p268
aVeverything in the world to feel good about in those last years,
p269
aVin the sense that he had been elected to the presidency;
p270
aVhe had all the money he needed to pursue
p271
aVany leisure activity he wanted;
p272
aVhe owned a spacious ranch in the countryside, a penthouse in the city,
p273
aVsailboats, speedboats.
p274
aVHe had servants to answer any whim,
p275
aVand he had a family who loved him deeply.
p276
aa(lp277
VAnd yet, years of concentration solely on work and individual success
p278
aVmeant that in his retirement he could find no solace
p279
aVin family, in recreation, in sports or in hobbies.
p280
aVIt was almost as if the hole in his heart was so large
p281
aVthat even the love of a family, without work, could not fill it.
p282
aVAs his spirits sagged, his body deteriorated
p283
aVuntil, I believe, he slowly brought about his own death.
p284
aVIn those last years, he said he was so sad
p285
aVwatching the American people look toward a new president and forgetting him.
p286
aVHe spoke with immense sadness in his voice,
p287
aVsaying maybe he should have spent more time with his children,
p288
aVand their children in turn.
p289
aVBut it was too late.
p290
aVDespite all that power, all that wealth,
p291
aVhe was alone when he finally died \u2014
p292
aVhis ultimate terror realized.
p293
aa(lp294
VSo as for that third sphere of play,
p295
aVwhich he never had learned to enjoy,
p296
aVI've learned over the years
p297
aVthat even this sphere requires a commitment of time and energy \u2014
p298
aVenough so that a hobby, a sport, a love of music,
p299
aVor art, or literature, or any form of recreation,
p300
aVcan provide true pleasure, relaxation and replenishment.
p301
aVSo deep, for instance, was Abraham Lincoln's love of Shakespeare,
p302
aVthat he made time to spend more than a hundred nights in the theater,
p303
aVeven during those dark days of the war.
p304
aVHe said, when the lights went down and a Shakespeare play came on,
p305
aVfor a few precious hours he could imagine himself
p306
aVback in Prince Hal's time.
p307
aa(lp308
VBut an even more important form of relaxation for him,
p309
aVthat Lyndon Johnson never could enjoy,
p310
aVwas a love of \u2014 somehow \u2014 humor,
p311
aVand feeling out what hilarious parts of life can produce
p312
aVas a sidelight to the sadness.
p313
aVHe once said that he laughed so he did not cry,
p314
aVthat a good story, for him, was better than a drop of whiskey.
p315
aVHis storytelling powers had first been recognized
p316
aVwhen he was on the circuit in Illinois.
p317
aVThe lawyers and the judges would travel
p318
aVfrom one county courthouse to the other,
p319
aVand when anyone was knowing Lincoln was in town,
p320
aVthey would come from miles around to listen to him tell stories.
p321
aVHe would stand with his back against a fire
p322
aVand entertain the crowd for hours with his winding tales.
p323
aVAnd all these stories became part of his memory bank,
p324
aVso he could call on them whenever he needed to.
p325
aVAnd they're not quite what you might expect from our marble monument.
p326
aa(lp327
VOne of his favorite stories, for example,
p328
aVhad to do with the Revolutionary War hero, Ethan Allen.
p329
aVAnd as Lincoln told the story,
p330
aVMr. Allen went to Britain after the war.
p331
aVAnd the British people were still upset
p332
aVabout losing the Revolution,
p333
aVso they decided to embarrass him a little bit
p334
aVby putting a huge picture of General Washington
p335
aVin the only outhouse, where he'd have to encounter it.
p336
aVThey figured he'd be upset about the indignity
p337
aVof George Washington being in an outhouse.
p338
aVBut he came out of the outhouse not upset at all.
p339
aVAnd so they said, "Well, did you see George Washington in there?"
p340
aV"Oh, yes," he said, "perfectly appropriate place for him."
p341
aV"What do you mean?" they said.
p342
aV"Well," he said, "there's nothing to make an Englishman shit
p343
aVfaster than the sight of General George Washington."
p344
aV(Laughter)
p345
aV(Applause)
p346
aa(lp347
VSo you can imagine, if you are in the middle of a tense cabinet meeting \u2014
p348
aVand he had hundreds of these stories \u2014
p349
aVyou would have to relax.
p350
aVSo between his nightly treks to the theater,
p351
aVhis story telling, and his extraordinary sense of humor
p352
aVand his love of quoting Shakespeare and poetry,
p353
aVhe found that form of play which carried him through his days.
p354
aVIn my own life, I shall always be grateful
p355
aVfor having found a form of play in my irrational love of baseball.
p356
aVWhich allows me, from the beginning of spring training
p357
aVto the end of the fall,
p358
aVto have something to occupy my mind and heart
p359
aVother than my work.
p360
aa(lp361
VIt all began when I was only six years old,
p362
aVand my father taught me that mysterious art of keeping score
p363
aVwhile listening to baseball games \u2014
p364
aVso that when he went to work in New York during the day,
p365
aVI could record for him the history of that afternoon's
p366
aVBrooklyn Dodgers game.
p367
aVNow, when you're only six years old,
p368
aVand your father comes home every single night
p369
aVand listens to you \u2014 as I now realize that I, in excruciating detail,
p370
aVrecounted every single play of every inning
p371
aVof the game that had just taken place that afternoon.
p372
aVBut he made me feel I was telling him a fabulous story.
p373
aVIt makes you think there's something magic about history
p374
aVto keep your father's attention.
p375
aa(lp376
VIn fact, I'm convinced I learned the narrative art
p377
aVfrom those nightly sessions with my father.
p378
aVBecause at first, I'd be so excited I would blurt out,
p379
aV"The Dodgers won!" or, "The Dodgers lost!"
p380
aVWhich took much of the drama of this two-hour telling away.
p381
aV(Laughter)
p382
aVSo I finally learned you had to tell a story
p383
aVfrom beginning to middle to end.
p384
aVI must say, so fervent was my love
p385
aVof the old Brooklyn Dodgers in those days
p386
aVthat I had to confess in my first confession
p387
aVtwo sins that related to baseball.
p388
aa(lp389
VThe first occurred because the Dodgers' catcher, Roy Campanella,
p390
aVcame to my hometown of Rockville Centre, Long Island,
p391
aVjust as I was in preparation for my first Holy Communion.
p392
aVAnd I was so excited \u2014
p393
aVfirst person I'd ever see outside of Ebbets Field.
p394
aVBut it so happened he was speaking in a Protestant Church.
p395
aVWhen you are brought up as a Catholic, you think
p396
aVthat if you ever set foot in a Protestant Church,
p397
aVyou'll be struck dead at the threshold.
p398
aVSo I went to my father in tears, "What are we going to do?"
p399
aVHe said, "Don't worry. He's speaking in a parish hall.
p400
aVWe're sitting in folding chairs. He's talking about sportsmanship.
p401
aVIt's not a sin."
p402
aVBut as I left that night, I was certain that somehow
p403
aVI'd traded the life of my everlasting soul
p404
aVfor this one night with Roy Campanella.
p405
aV(Laughter)
p406
aVAnd there were no indulgences around that I could buy.
p407
aVSo I had this sin on my soul when I went to my first confession.
p408
aVI told the priest right away.
p409
aVHe said, "No problem. It wasn't a religious service."
p410
aVBut then, unfortunately, he said, "And what else, my child?"
p411
aa(lp412
VAnd then came my second sin.
p413
aVI tried to sandwich it in between talking too much in church,
p414
aVwishing harm to others, being mean to my sisters.
p415
aVAnd he said, "To whom did you wish harm?"
p416
aVAnd I had to say that I wished that various New York Yankees players
p417
aVwould break arms, legs and ankles \u2014
p418
aV(Laughter)
p419
aV\u2014 so that the Brooklyn Dodgers could win their first World Series.
p420
aVHe said, "How often do you make these horrible wishes?"
p421
aVAnd I had to say, every night when I said my prayers.

aVSo he said, "Look, I'll tell you something.
p424
aVI love the Brooklyn Dodgers, as you do,
p425
aVbut I promise you some day they will win fairly and squarely.
p426
aVYou do not need to wish harm on others to make it happen."
p427
aV"Oh yes," I said.
p428
aVBut luckily, my first confession \u2014 to a baseball-loving priest!
p429
aV(Laughter)
p430
aa(lp431
VWell, though my father died of a sudden heart attack
p432
aVwhen I was still in my 20s,
p433
aVbefore I had gotten married and had my three sons,
p434
aVI have passed his memory \u2014 as well as his love of baseball \u2014 on to my boys.
p435
aVThough when the Dodgers abandoned us to come to L.A.,
p436
aVI lost faith in baseball until I moved to Boston
p437
aVand became an irrational Red Socks fan.
p438
aVAnd I must say, even now, when I sit with my sons
p439
aVwith our season tickets,
p440
aVI can sometimes close my eyes against the sun
p441
aVand imagine myself, a young girl once more, in the presence of my father,
p442
aVwatching the players of my youth on the grassy fields below:
p443
aVJackie Robinson, Roy Campanella, Pee Wee Reese, and Duke Snider.
p444
aa(lp445
VI must say there is magic in these moments.
p446
aVWhen I open my eyes and I see my sons
p447
aVin the place where my father once sat,
p448
aVI feel an invisible loyalty and love
p449
aVlinking my sons to the grandfather whose face they never had a chance to see,
p450
aVbut whose heart and soul they have come to know
p451
aVthrough all the stories I have told.
p452
aVWhich is why, in the end, I shall always be grateful for this curious love of history,
p453
aVallowing me to spend a lifetime looking back into the past.
p454
aVAllowing me to learn from these large figures
p455
aVabout the struggle for meaning for life.
p456
aVAllowing me to believe that the private people
p457
aVwe have loved and lost in our families,
p458
aVand the public figures we have respected in our history,
p459
aVjust as Abraham Lincoln wanted to believe,
p460
aVreally can live on, so long as we pledge
p461
aVto tell and to retell the stories of their lives.
p462
aVThank you for letting me be that storyteller today.
p463
aV(Applause)
p464
aVThank you.
