VSo how would you run a whole country without oil?
p4
aVThat's the question that sort of hit me
p5
aVin the middle of a Davos afternoon about four years ago.
p6
aVIt never left my brain.
p7
aVAnd I started playing with it more like a puzzle.
p8
aVThe original thought I had: this must be ethanol.
p9
aVSo I went out and researched ethanol,
p10
aVand found out you need the Amazon in your backyard in every country.
p11
aVAbout six months later I figured out it must be hydrogen,
p12
aVuntil some scientist told me the unfortunate truth,
p13
aVwhich is, you actually use more
p14
aVclean electrons than the ones you get
p15
aVinside a car, if you use hydrogen.
p16
aVSo that is not going to be the path to go.
p17
aa(lp18
VAnd then sort of through a process of
p19
aVwandering around, I got to the thought
p20
aVthat actually if you could convert an entire country to electric cars,
p21
aVin a way that is convenient and affordable,
p22
aVyou could get to a solution.
p23
aVNow I started this from a point of view that
p24
aVit has to be something that scales en masse.
p25
aVNot how do you build one car,
p26
aVbut how do you scale this so that it can become
p27
aVsomething that is used by 99 percent of the population?
p28
aVThe thought that came to mind is that it needs to be as good
p29
aVas any car that you would have today.
p30
aVSo one, it has to be more convenient than a car.
p31
aVAnd two, it has be more affordable than today's cars.
p32
aVAffordable is not a 40,000 dollar sedan, right?
p33
aVAlright? That's not something that we can finance or buy today.
p34
aVAnd convenient is not something that you drive for an hour and charge for eight.
p35
aa(lp36
VSo we're bound with the laws of physics
p37
aVand the laws of economics.
p38
aVAnd so the thought that I started with was
p39
aVhow do you do this, still within the boundary
p40
aVof the science we know today \u2014
p41
aVno time for science fair, no time for playing around with things
p42
aVor waiting for the magic battery to show up.
p43
aVHow do you do it within the economics that we have today?
p44
aVHow do you do it from the power of the consumer up?
p45
aVAnd not from the power of an edict down.
p46
aa(lp47
VOn a random visit to Tesla on some afternoon,
p48
aVI actually found out that the answer comes
p49
aVfrom separating between the car ownership
p50
aVand the battery ownership.
p51
aVIn a sense if you want to think about it this is the classic
p52
aV"batteries not included."
p53
aVNow if you separate between the two,
p54
aVyou could actually answer the need for a convenient car
p55
aVby creating a network,
p56
aVby creating a network before the cars show up.
p57
aVThe network has two components in them.
p58
aVFirst component is you charge the car whenever you stop \u2014
p59
aVends up that cars are these strange beasts that drive
p60
aVfor about two hours and park for about 22 hours.
p61
aVIf you drive a car in the morning and drive it back in the afternoon
p62
aVthe ratio of charge to drive is about a minute for a minute.
p63
aVAnd so the first thought that came to mind is,
p64
aVeverywhere we park we have electric power.
p65
aVNow it sounds crazy. But in some places around the world,
p66
aVlike Scandinavia, you already have that.
p67
aVIf you park your car and didn't plug in the heater,
p68
aVwhen you come back you don't have a car. It just doesn't work.
p69
aa(lp70
VNow that last mile,
p71
aVlast foot, in a sense,
p72
aVis the first step of the infrastructure.
p73
aVThe second step of the infrastructure needs to take care
p74
aVof the range extension.
p75
aVSee we're bound by today's technology on batteries,
p76
aVwhich is about 120 miles if you want to stay within
p77
aVreasonable space and weight limitations.
p78
aV120 miles is a good enough range for a lot of people.
p79
aVBut you never want to get stuck.
p80
aVSo what we added is a second element to our network,
p81
aVwhich is a battery swap system.
p82
aVYou drive. You take your depleted battery out.
p83
aVA full battery comes on. And you drive on.
p84
aVYou don't do it as a human being. You do it as a machine.
p85
aVIt looks like a car wash. You come into your car wash.
p86
aVAnd a plate comes up, holds your battery, takes it out, puts it back in, and
p87
aVwithin two minutes you're back on the road
p88
aVand you can go again.
p89
aVIf you had charge spots everywhere,
p90
aVand you had battery swap stations everywhere,
p91
aVhow often would you do it? And it ends up
p92
aVthat you'd do swapping less times than you stop at a gas station.
p93
aVAs a matter of fact, we added to the contract.
p94
aVWe said that if you stop to swap your battery more than 50 times a year
p95
aVwe start paying you money
p96
aVbecause it's an inconvenience.
p97
aa(lp98
VThen we looked at the question of the affordability.
p99
aVWe looked at the question, what happens when the battery is
p100
aVdisconnected from the car.
p101
aVWhat is the cost of that battery?
p102
aVEverybody tells us batteries are so expensive.
p103
aVWhat we found out, when you move from molecules to electrons,
p104
aVsomething interesting happens.
p105
aVWe can go back to the original economics of the car and look at it again.
p106
aVThe battery is not the gas tank, in a sense.
p107
aVRemember in your car you have a gas tank.
p108
aVYou have the crude oil.
p109
aVAnd you have refining and delivery of that crude oil
p110
aVas what we call petrol or gasoline.
p111
aVThe battery in this sense, is the crude oil.
p112
aVWe have a battery bay. It costs the same hundred dollars
p113
aVas the gas tank.
p114
aVBut the crude oil is replaced with a battery.
p115
aVJust it doesn't burn. It consumes itself
p116
aVstep after step after step.
p117
aVIt has 2,000 life cycles these days.
p118
aVAnd so it's sort of a mini well.
p119
aVWe were asked in the past when we bought an electric car
p120
aVto pay for the entire well, for the life of the car.
p121
aVNobody wants to buy a mini well when they buy a car.
p122
aVIn a sense what we've done is
p123
aVwe've created a new consumable.
p124
aa(lp125
VYou, today, buy gasoline miles.
p126
aVAnd we created electric miles.
p127
aVAnd the price of electric miles ends up being a very interesting number.
p128
aVToday 2010, in volume,
p129
aVwhen we come to market, it is eight cents a mile.
p130
aVThose of you who have a hard time calculating what that means \u2014
p131
aVin the average consumer
p132
aVenvironment we're in in the U.S.
p133
aV20 miles per gallon that's a buck 50, a buck 60 a gallon.
p134
aVThat's cheaper than today's gasoline, even in the U.S.
p135
aVIn Europe where taxes are in place,
p136
aVthat's the equivalent to a minus 60 dollar barrel.
p137
aVBut e-miles follow Moore's Law.
p138
aVThey go from eight cents a mile in 2010,
p139
aVto four cents a mile in 2015,
p140
aVto two cents a mile by 2020.
p141
aVWhy? Because batteries life cycle improve \u2014
p142
aVa bit of improvement on energy density, which reduces the price.
p143
aVAnd these prices are actually with clean electrons.
p144
aVWe do not use any electrons that come from coal.
p145
aVSo in a sense this is
p146
aVan absolute zero-carbon, zero-fossil fuel
p147
aVelectric mile at two cents a mile by 2020.
p148
aVNow even if we get to 40 miles per gallon
p149
aVby 2020, which is our desire.
p150
aVImagine only 40 miles per gallon cars would be on the road.
p151
aVThat is an 80 cent gallon.
p152
aVAn 80 cent gallon means, if the entire Pacific
p153
aVwould convert to crude oil,
p154
aVand we'd let any oil company bring it out and refine it,
p155
aVthey still can't compete with two cents a mile.
p156
aVThat's a new economic factor,
p157
aVwhich is fascinating to most people.
p158
aa(lp159
VNow this would have been a wonderful paper.
p160
aVThat's how I solved it in my head. It was a white paper I handed out to governments.
p161
aVAnd some governments told me that it's fascinating
p162
aVthat the younger generation actually thinks about these things.
p163
aV(Laughter)
p164
aVUntil I got to the
p165
aVtrue young global leader, Shimon Peres, President of Israel,
p166
aVand he ran a beautiful manipulation on me.
p167
aVFirst he let me go to the prime minister of the country,
p168
aVwho told me, if you can find the money you need for this network,
p169
aV200 million dollars,
p170
aVand if you can find a car company
p171
aVthat will build that car in mass volume,
p172
aVin two million cars \u2014 that's what we needed in Israel \u2014
p173
aVI'll give you country to invest the 200 million into.
p174
aVPeres thought that was a great idea.
p175
aa(lp176
VSo we went out, and we looked at all the car companies.
p177
aVWe sent letters to all the car companies.
p178
aVThree of them never showed up. One of them asked us
p179
aVif we would stay with hybrids and they would give us a discount.
p180
aVBut one of them Carlos Ghosn, CEO of Renault and Nissan,
p181
aVwhen asked about hybrids said something very fascinating.
p182
aVHe said hybrids are like mermaids.
p183
aVWhen you want a fish you get a woman and
p184
aVwhen you need a woman you get a fish.
p185
aV(Laughter)
p186
aVAnd Ghosn came up and said,
p187
aV"I have the car, Mr. Peres; I will build you the cars."
p188
aVAnd actually true to form, Renault has put a billion and a half dollars
p189
aVin building nine different types of cars that fit this kind of model
p190
aVthat will come into the market in mass volume \u2014
p191
aVmass volume being the first year, 100 thousand cars.
p192
aVIt's the first mass-volume electric car,
p193
aVzero-emission electric car in the market.
p194
aVI was running, as Chris said,
p195
aVto be the CEO of a large software company called SAP
p196
aVAnd then Peres said, "Well won't you run this project?"
p197
aVAnd I said, "I'm ready for CEO" And he said,
p198
aV"Oh no no no no no. You've got to explain to me,
p199
aVwhat is more important than saving your country and saving the world,
p200
aVthat you would go and do?"
p201
aa(lp202
VAnd I had to quit and come and do this thing called A Better Place.
p203
aVWe then decided to scale it up.
p204
aVWe went to other countries. As I said we went to Denmark.
p205
aVAnd Denmark set this beautiful policy;
p206
aVit's called the IQ test.
p207
aVIt's inversely proportional to taxes.
p208
aVThey put 180 percent tax on gasoline cars
p209
aVand zero tax on zero-emission cars.
p210
aVSo if you want to buy a gasoline car in Denmark, it costs you about 60,000 Euros.
p211
aVIf you buy our car it's about 20,000 Euros.
p212
aVIf you fail the IQ test they ask you to leave the country.
p213
aV(Laughter)
p214
aa(lp215
VWe then were sort of coined as the guys
p216
aVwho run only in small islands.
p217
aVI know most people don't think of Israel as a small island,
p218
aVbut Israel is an island \u2014 it's a transportation island.
p219
aVIf your car is driving outside Israel it's been stolen.
p220
aV(Laughter)
p221
aVIf you're thinking about it in terms of islands,
p222
aVwe decided to go to the biggest island that we could find,
p223
aVand that was Australia. The third country we announced was Australia.
p224
aVIt's got three centers \u2014
p225
aVin Brisbane, in Melbourne, in Sydney \u2014
p226
aVand one freeway, one electric freeway that connects them.
p227
aVThe next island
p228
aVwas not too hard to find, and that was Hawaii.
p229
aVWe decided to come into the U.S.
p230
aVand pick the two best places \u2014
p231
aVthe one where you didn't need any range extension.
p232
aVHawaii you can drive around the island on one battery.
p233
aVAnd if you really have a long day you can switch,
p234
aVand keep on driving around the island.
p235
aa(lp236
VThe second one was the San Francisco Bay Area
p237
aVwhere Gavin Newsom created a beautiful policy across all the mayors.
p238
aVHe decided that he's going to take over
p239
aVthe state, unofficially, and then officially,
p240
aVand then created this beautiful Region One policy.
p241
aVIn the San Francisco Bay Area not only do you have
p242
aVthe highest concentration of Priuses,
p243
aVbut you also have the perfect range extender.
p244
aVIt's called the other car.
p245
aVAs we stared scaling it up
p246
aVwe looked at what is the problem to come up to the U.S.?
p247
aVWhy is this a big issue?
p248
aVAnd the most fascinating thing we've learned is that,
p249
aVwhen you have small problems on the individual level,
p250
aVlike the price of gasoline to drive every morning.
p251
aVYou don't notice it, but when the aggregate comes up
p252
aVyou're dead. Alright?
p253
aa(lp254
VSo the price of oil, much like
p255
aVlots of other curves that we've seen,
p256
aVgoes along a depletion curve.
p257
aVThe foundation of this curve is that we keep losing the wells that are close to the ground.
p258
aVAnd we keep getting wells that are farther away from the ground.
p259
aVIt becomes more and more and more expensive to dig them out.
p260
aVYou think, well it's been up, it's been down,
p261
aVits been up, it's going to keep on going up and down.
p262
aVHere is the problem:
p263
aVat 147 dollars a barrel, which we were in six months ago,
p264
aVthe U.S. spent a ton of money to get oil.
p265
aVThen we lost our economy and we went back down to 47 \u2014
p266
aVsometimes it's 40, sometimes it's 50.
p267
aVNow we're running a stimulus package.
p268
aVIt's called the trillion-dollar stimulus package.
p269
aVWe're going to revive the economy. Hopefully it happens between now and 2015,
p270
aVsomewhere in that space.
p271
aVWhat happens when the economy recovers?
p272
aVBy 2015 we would have had at least 250 million new cars
p273
aVeven at the pace we're going at right now.
p274
aVThat's another 30 percent demand on oil.
p275
aVThat is another 25 million barrels a day.
p276
aVThat's all the U.S. usage today.
p277
aVIn other words at some point when we've recovered we go up to the peak.
p278
aVAnd then we do the OPEC stimulus package
p279
aValso known as 200 dollars a barrel.
p280
aVWe take our money and we give it away.
p281
aVYou know what happens at that point?
p282
aVWe go back down. It's going to go up and down.
p283
aVAnd the downs are going to be much longer
p284
aVand the ups are going to be much shorter.
p285
aa(lp286
VAnd that's the difference between problems that are additive,
p287
aVlike CO2, which we go slowly up and then we tip,
p288
aVand problems that are depletive,
p289
aVin which we lose what we have,
p290
aVwhich oscillate, and they oscillate until
p291
aVwe lose everything we've got.
p292
aVNow we actually looked at what the answer would be.
p293
aVRight? Remember in the campaign: one million
p294
aVhybrid cars by 2015.
p295
aVThat is 0.5 percent of the U.S. oil consumption.
p296
aVThat is oh point oh well percent of the rest of the world.
p297
aVThat won't do much difference.
p298
aa(lp299
VWe looked at an MIT study:
p300
aVten million electric cars on the global roads.
p301
aVTen million out of 500 million we will add between now and then.
p302
aVThat is the most pessimistic number you can have.
p303
aVIt's also the most optimistic number
p304
aVbecause it means we will scale this industry
p305
aVfrom 100 thousand cars is 2011,
p306
aVto 10 million cars by 2016 \u2014
p307
aV100 x growth in less than five years.
p308
aVYou have to remember that the world today is bringing in so many cars.
p309
aVWe have 10 million cars by region.
p310
aVThat's an enormous amount of cars.
p311
aa(lp312
VChina is adding those cars \u2014
p313
aVIndia, Russia, Brazil.
p314
aVWe have all these regions.
p315
aVEurope has solved it. They just put a tax on gasoline.
p316
aVThey'll be the first in line to get off
p317
aVbecause their prices are high.
p318
aVChina solves it by an edict. At some point they'll just declare
p319
aVthat no gasoline car will come into a city, and that will be it.
p320
aVThe Indians don't even understand why we think of it as a problem
p321
aVbecause most people in India fill two or three gallons every time.
p322
aVFor them to get a battery that goes 120 miles
p323
aVis an extension on range, not a reduction in range.
p324
aVWe're the only ones who don't have the price set right.
p325
aVWe don't have the industry set right.
p326
aVWe don't have any incentive to go and resolve it
p327
aVacross the U.S.
p328
aa(lp329
VNow where is the car industry on that?
p330
aVVery interesting. The car industry has been focused just on themselves.
p331
aVThey basically looked at it and said, "Car 1.0
p332
aVwe'll solve everything within the car itself."
p333
aVNo infrastructure, no problem.
p334
aVWe forgot about the entire chain around us.
p335
aVAll this stuff that happens around.
p336
aVWe are looking at the emergence of a car 2.0 \u2014
p337
aVa whole new market, a whole new business model.
p338
aVThe business model in which the money that is actually coming in,
p339
aVto drive the car \u2014
p340
aVthe minutes, the miles if you want,
p341
aVthat you are all familiar with \u2014
p342
aVsubsidize the price of the car,
p343
aVjust like cellphones. You'll pay for the miles.
p344
aVAnd some of it will go back to the car maker.
p345
aVSome of it will go back to your own pocket.
p346
aVBut our cars are actually going to be cheaper than gasoline cars.
p347
aa(lp348
VYou're looking at a world where cars are matched with windmills.
p349
aVIn Denmark, we will drive all the cars in Denmark
p350
aVfrom windmills, not from oil.
p351
aVIn Israel, we've asked to put a solar farm
p352
aVin the south of Israel.
p353
aVAnd people said, "Oh that's a very very large space that you're asking for."
p354
aVAnd we said, "What if we had proven that in the same space
p355
aVwe found oil for the country for the next hundred years?"
p356
aVAnd they said, "We tried. There isn't any."
p357
aVWe said, "No no, but what if we prove it?"
p358
aVAnd they said, "Well you can dig." And we decided to dig up,
p359
aVinstead of digging down.
p360
aVThese are perfect matches to one another.
p361
aa(lp362
VNow all you need is about 10 percent
p363
aVof the electricity generated.
p364
aVThink of it as a project that spans over about 10 years.
p365
aVThat's one percent a year.
p366
aVNow when we're looking at solving big problems,
p367
aVwe need to start thinking in two numbers.
p368
aVAnd those are not 20 percent by 2020.
p369
aVThe two numbers are zero \u2014 as in zero footprint or zero oil \u2014
p370
aVand scale it infinity.
p371
aVAnd when we go to COP15 at the end of this year
p372
aVwe can't stop thinking of padding CO2.
p373
aVWe have to start thinking about giving kickers to countries
p374
aVthat are willing to go to this kind of scale.
p375
aa(lp376
VOne car emits four tons.
p377
aVAnd actually 700 and change million cars today
p378
aVemit 2.8 billion tons of CO2.
p379
aVThat's, in the additive, about 25 percent of our problem.
p380
aVCars and trucks add up to about 25 percent of the world's CO2 emissions.
p381
aVWe have to come and attack this problem
p382
aVwith a focus, with an effort that actually says,
p383
aVwe're going to go to zero before the world ends.
p384
aVI actually shared that with some legislators here in the U.S.
p385
aVI shared it with a gentleman called Bobby Kennedy Jr., who is one of my idols.
p386
aVI told him one of the reasons that
p387
aVhis uncle was remembered
p388
aVis because he said we're going to send a man to the moon,
p389
aVand we'll do it by the end of the decade.
p390
aVWe didn't say we're going to send a man 20 percent to the moon.
p391
aVAnd there will be about a 20 percent chance we'll recover him.
p392
aV(Laughter)
p393
aa(lp394
VHe actually shared with me another story, which is from about 200 years ago.
p395
aV200 years ago, in Parliament, in Great Britain,
p396
aVthere was a long argument
p397
aVover economy versus morality.
p398
aV25 percent \u2014 just like 25 percent emissions today comes from cars \u2014
p399
aV25 percent of their energy
p400
aVfor the entire industrial world in the U.K.
p401
aVcame from a source of energy that was immoral:
p402
aVhuman slaves.
p403
aVAnd there was an argument. Should we stop using slaves?
p404
aVAnd what would it do to our economy?
p405
aVAnd people said, "Well we need to take time to do it.
p406
aVLet's not do it immediately. Maybe we free the kids
p407
aVand keep the slaves.
p408
aVAnd after a month of arguments they decided to stop slavery,
