VZach Kaplan: Keith and I lead a research team.
p4
aVWe investigate materials and technologies
p5
aVthat have unexpected properties. Over the last three years,
p6
aVwe found over 200 of these things, and so we looked
p7
aVback into our library and selected six we thought would be most
p8
aVsurprising for TED.
p9
aVOf these six, the first one that we're going to talk about
p10
aVis in the black envelope you're holding.
p11
aVIt comes from a company in Japan called GelTech. Now go ahead and open it up.
p12
aa(lp13
VKeith Schacht: Now be sure and take the two pieces apart.
p14
aVWhat's unexpected about this is that it's soft, but it's also a strong magnet.
p15
aVZach and I have always been fascinated
p16
aVobserving unexpected things like this.
p17
aVWe spent a long time thinking about why this is, and it's just recently that we realized:
p18
aVit's when we see something unexpected,
p19
aVit changes our understanding of the way things work.
p20
aVAs you're seeing this gel magnet for the first time,
p21
aVif you assume that all magnets had to be hard,
p22
aVthen seeing this surprised you and it changed your understanding
p23
aVof the way magnets could work.
p24
aa(lp25
VZK: Now, it's important to understand what the unexpected properties are.
p26
aVBut to really think about the implications of what this makes possible,
p27
aVwe found that it helps to think about how it could be applied in the world.
p28
aVSo, a first idea is to use it on cabinet doors.
p29
aVIf you line the sides of the cabinets using the gel material \u2014
p30
aVif a cabinet slams shut it wouldn't make a loud noise,
p31
aVand in addition the magnets would draw the cabinets closed.
p32
aVImagine taking the same material, but putting it on the bottom of a sneaker.
p33
aVYou know, this way you could go to the container store and buy one of those
p34
aVmetal sheets that they hang on the back of your door, in your closet,
p35
aVand you could literally stick your shoes up instead of using a shelf.
p36
aVFor me, I really love this idea.
p37
aV(Laughter)
p38
aVIf you come to my apartment and see my closet,
p39
aVI'm sure you'd figure out why: it's a mess.
p40
aa(lp41
VKS: Seeing the unexpected properties and then seeing a couple of
p42
aVapplications \u2014 it helps you see why this is significant, what the potential is.
p43
aVBut we've found that the way we present our ideas
p44
aVit makes a big difference.
p45
aa(lp46
VZK: It was like six months ago that Keith and I were out in L.A.,
p47
aVand we were at Starbucks having coffee with Roman Coppola.
p48
aVHe works on mostly music videos and commercials
p49
aVwith his company, The Directors Bureau.
p50
aVAs we were talking, Roman told us that he's kind of an inventor on the side.
p51
aVAnd we were showing him the same
p52
aVgel magnet that you're holding in your hand \u2014 and you know,
p53
aVwe shared the same ideas. And you could see it in his face:
p54
aVRoman starts to get really excited and he whips out this manila folder;
p55
aVhe opens it up and Keith and I look in,
p56
aVand he starts showing us concepts that he's been working on.
p57
aVThese things just get him really excited. And so we're looking
p58
aVat these concepts, and we were just like, whoa, this guy's good.
p59
aVBecause the way that he presented the concept \u2014 his approach
p60
aVwas totally different than ours. He sold it to you as if it was for sale right now.
p61
aVWhen we were going in the car back to the airport,
p62
aVwe were thinking: why was this so powerful?
p63
aVAnd as we thought about it more, we realized that
p64
aVit let you fill in all the details about the experience,
p65
aVjust as if you saw it on TV. So, for TED we decided to take our favorite
p66
aVidea for the gel magnet and work with Roman and his team
p67
aVat the Directors Bureau to create a commercial for a product
p68
aVfrom the future.
p69
aa(lp70
VNarrator: Do you have a need for speed?
p71
aVInventables Water Adventures dares you to launch yourself
p72
aVon a magnetically-levitating board down a waterslide
p73
aVso fast, so tall, that when you hit the bottom, it uses brakes to stop.
p74
aVAqua Rocket: coming this summer.
p75
aa(lp76
VKS: Now, we showed the concept to a few people before this,
p77
aVand they asked us, when's it coming out?
p78
aVSo I just wanted to let you know, it's not actually coming out,
p79
aVjust the concept is.
p80
aa(lp81
VZK: So now, when we dream up these concepts, it's important for us
p82
aVto make sure that they work from a technical standpoint.
p83
aVSo I just want to quickly explain how this would work.
p84
aVThis is the magnetically-levitating board that they mentioned in the commercial.
p85
aVThe gel that you're holding would be lining the bottom of the board.
p86
aVNow this is important for two reasons.
p87
aVOne: the soft properties of the magnet that make it so that, if it were
p88
aVto hit the rider in the head, it wouldn't injure him.
p89
aVIn addition, you can see from the diagram on the right,
p90
aVthe underpart of the slide would be an electromagnet.
p91
aVSo this would actually repel the rider a little bit as you're going down.
p92
aVThe force of the water rushing down, in addition to that repulsion force,
p93
aVwould make this slide go faster than any slide on the market.
p94
aVIt's because of this that you need the magnetic braking system.
p95
aVWhen you get to the very bottom of the slide \u2014
p96
aV(Laughter)
p97
aV\u2014 the rider passes through an aluminum tube.
p98
aVAnd I'm going to kick it to Keith to explain why that's important
p99
aVfrom a technical standpoint.
p100
aa(lp101
VKS: So I'm sure all you engineers know that even though aluminum is
p102
aVa metal, it's not a magnetic material. But something unexpected
p103
aVhappens when you drop a magnet down an aluminum tube.
p104
aVSo we set up a quick experiment here to show that to you.
p105
aV(Laughter)
p106
aVNow, you see the magnet fell really slowly.
p107
aVNow, I'm not going to get into the physics of it,
p108
aVbut all you need to know is that the faster the magnet's falling,
p109
aVthe greater the stopping force.
p110
aa(lp111
VZK: Now, our next technology is actually a 10-foot pole,
p112
aVand I have it right here in my pocket.
p113
aV(Laughter)
p114
aVThere're a few different versions of it.
p115
aV(Laughter)
p116
aVKS: Some of them automatically unroll like this one.
p117
aVThey can be made to automatically roll up, or they can be made
p118
aVstable, like Zach's, to hold any position in between.
p119
aa(lp120
VZK: As we were talking to the vendor \u2014 to try to learn about
p121
aVhow you could apply these, or how they're being applied currently \u2014
p122
aVhe was telling us that, in the military they use this one
p123
aVso soldiers can keep it on their chests \u2014 very concealed \u2014
p124
aVand then, when they're out on the field, erect it as an antenna
p125
aVto clearly send signals back to the base.
p126
aVIn our brainstorms, we came up with the idea you could use it for a soccer goal:
p127
aVso at the end of the game, you just roll up the goal and put it in your gym bag.
p128
aV(Laughter)
p129
aa(lp130
VKS: Now, the interesting thing about this is,
p131
aVyou don't have to be an engineer to appreciate why
p132
aVa 10-foot pole that can fit in your pocket is so interesting.
p133
aV(Laughter)
p134
aVSo we decided to go out onto the streets of Chicago
p135
aVand ask a few people on the streets what they thought you could do with this.
p136
aa(lp137
VMan: I clean my ceiling fans with that and I get the spider webs
p138
aVoff my house \u2014 I do it that way.
p139
aVWoman: I'd make my very own walking stick.
p140
aVWoman: I would create a ladder to use to get up on top of the tree.
p141
aVWoman: An olive server.
p142
aVMan: Some type of extension pole \u2014 like what the painters use.
p143
aVWoman: I would make a spear that, when you went deep sea diving,
p144
aVyou could catch the fish really fast, and then roll it back up,
p145
aVand you could swim easier ... Yeah.
p146
aV(Laughter)
p147
aa(lp148
VZK: Now, for our next technology we're going to do a little demonstration,
p149
aVand so we need a volunteer from the audience.
p150
aVYou sir, come on up.
p151
aV(Laughter)
p152
aVCome on up. Tell everybody your name.
p153
aa(lp154
VSteve Jurvetson: Steve.
p155
aa(lp156
VZK: It's Steve. All right Steve, now, follow me.
p157
aVWe need you to stand right in front of the TED sign.
p158
aVRight there. That's great.
p159
aVAnd hold onto this. Good luck to you.
p160
aV(Laughter)
p161
aa(lp162
VKS: No, not yet.
p163
aV(Laughter)
p164
aa(lp165
VZK: I'd just like to let you all know that this presentation
p166
aVhas been brought to you by Target.
p167
aa(lp168
VKS: Little bit \u2014 that's perfect, just perfect.
p169
aVNow, Zach, we're going to demonstrate
p170
aVa water gun fight from the future.
p171
aV(Laughter)
p172
aVSo here, come on up to the front. All right, so
p173
aVnow if you'll see here \u2014 no, no, it's OK.
p174
aVSo, describe to the audience the temperature of your shirt. Go ahead.
p175
aa(lp176
VSJ: It's cold.
p177
aa(lp178
VKS: Now the reason it's cold is that's it's not actually water loaded
p179
aVinto these squirt guns \u2014 it's a dry liquid developed by 3M.
p180
aVIt's perfectly clear, it's odorless, it's colorless.
p181
aVIt's so safe you could drink this stuff.
p182
aV(Laughter)
p183
aVAnd the reason it feels cold is because it evaporates
p184
aV25 times faster than water.
p185
aV(Laughter)
p186
aVAll right, well thanks for coming up.
p187
aV(Laughter)
p188
aa(lp189
VZK: Wait, wait, Steven \u2014 before you go we filled this with the dry liquid
p190
aVso during the break you can shoot your friends.
p191
aVSJ: Excellent, thank you.
p192
aa(lp193
VKS: Thanks for coming up. Let's give him a big round of applause.
p194
aV(Applause)
p195
aa(lp196
VSo what's the significance of this dry liquid?
p197
aVEarly versions of the fluid were actually used on a Cray Supercomputer.
p198
aVNow, the unexpected thing about this
p199
aVis that Zach could stand up on stage and drench
p200
aVa perfectly innocent member of the audience without any concern
p201
aVthat we'd damage the electronics, that we'd get him wet,
p202
aVthat we'd hurt the books or the computers. It works because it's non-conductive.
p203
aVSo you can see here, you can immerse a whole circuit board
p204
aVin this and it wouldn't cause any damage.
p205
aVYou can circulate it to draw the heat away.
p206
aVBut today it's most widely used in office buildings \u2014
p207
aVin the sprinkler system \u2014 as a fire-suppression fluid.
p208
aVAgain, it's perfectly safe for people. It puts out the fires, doesn't hurt anything.
p209
aVBut our favorite idea for this
p210
aVwas using it in a basketball game. So during halftime,
p211
aVit could rain down on the players, cool everyone down,
p212
aVand in a matter of minutes it would dry. Wouldn't hurt the court.
p213
aa(lp214
VZK: Our next technology comes to us from a company in Japan
p215
aVcalled Sekisui Chemical. One of their R&D engineers
p216
aVwas working on a way to make plastic stiffer.
p217
aVWhile he was doing this, he noticed an unexpected thing.
p218
aVWe have a video to show you.
p219
aa(lp220
VKS: So you see there, it didn't bounce back. Now, this was
p221
aVan unintended side effect of some experiments they were doing.
p222
aVIt's technically called, "shape-retaining property."
p223
aVNow, think about your interactions with aluminum foil.
p224
aVShape-retaining is common in metal: you bend a piece of aluminum foil,
p225
aVand it holds its place. Contrast that with
p226
aVa plastic garbage can \u2014 and you can push in the sides
p227
aVand it always bounces back.
p228
aa(lp229
VZK: For example, you could make a watch that wraps around your wrist,
p230
aVbut doesn't use a buckle.
p231
aVTaking it a little further, if you wove
p232
aVthose strips together \u2014 kind of like a little basket \u2014 you could make
p233
aVa shape-retaining sheet, and then you could embed it in a cloth:
p234
aVso you could make a picnic sheet that wraps around the table,
p235
aVso that way on a windy day it wouldn't blow away.
p236
aVFor our next technology, it's hard to observe
p237
aVthe unexpected property by itself, because it's an ink.
p238
aVSo, we've prepared a video to show it applied to paper.
p239
aa(lp240
VKS: As this paper is bending, the resistance of the ink changes.
p241
aVSo with simple electronics, you can detect how much the page is being bent.
p242
aVNow, to think about the potential for this,
p243
aVthink of all the places ink is supplied: on business cards,
p244
aVon the back of cereal boxes, board games. Any place you use ink,
p245
aVyou could change the way you interact with it.
p246
aa(lp247
VZK: So my favorite idea for this is to apply the ink to a book.
p248
aVThis could totally change the way that you interface with paper.
p249
aVYou see the dark line on the side and the top. As you turn the pages
p250
aVof the book, the book can actually detect what page you're on,
p251
aVbased on the curvature of the pages.
p252
aVIn addition, if you were to fold in one of the corners, then you could program
p253
aVthe book to actually email you the text on the page for your notes.
p254
aa(lp255
VKS: For our last technology, we worked again with Roman and his team
p256
aVat the Directors Bureau to develop a commercial from the future
p257
aVto explain how it works.
p258
aa(lp259
VOld Milk Carton: Oh yeah, it smells good.
p260
aVWho are you?
p261
aVNew Milk Carton: I'm New Milk.
p262
aVOMC: I used to smell like you.
p263
aVNarrator: Fresh Watch, from Inventables Dairy Farms.
p264
aVPackaging that changes color when your milk's gone off.
p265
aVDon't let milk spoil your morning.
p266
aa(lp267
VZK: Now, this technology was developed by these two guys:
p268
aVProfessor Ken Suslick and Neil Rakow, of the University of Illinois.
p269
aa(lp270
VKS: Now the way it works: there's a matrix of color dyes.
p271
aVAnd these dyes change color in response to odors.
p272
aVSo the smell of vanilla, that might change the four on the left to brown
p273
aVand the one on the right to yellow. This matrix can produce
p274
aVthousands of different color combinations to represent thousands of different smells.
p275
aVBut like in the milk commercial, if you know what odor you want to detect,
p276
aVthen they can formulate a specific dye to detect just that odor.
p277
aa(lp278
VZK: Right. It was that that started a conversation with Professor Suslick and myself,
p279
aVand he was explaining to me the things that this is making possible,
p280
aVbeyond just detecting spoiled food. It's really where the significance of it lies.
p281
aVHis company actually did a survey of firemen all across the country to try to learn,
p282
aVhow are they currently testing the air when they respond to an emergency scene?
p283
aVAnd he kind of comically explained that
p284
aVtime after time, what the firemen would say is:
p285
aVthey would rush to the scene of the crime; they would look around;
p286
aVif there were no dead policemen, it was OK to go.
p287
aV(Laughter)
p288
aVI mean, this is a true story. They're using policemen as canaries.
p289
aV(Laughter)
p290
aVBut more seriously, they determined that you could develop
p291
aVa device that can smell better than the humans,
p292
aVand say if it's safe for the firemen.
p293
aVIn addition, he's spun off a company from the University called ChemSensing,
p294
aVwhere they're working on medical equipment.
p295
aVSo, a patient can come in and actually blow into their device.
p296
aVBy detecting the odor of particular bacteria, or viruses,
p297
aVor even lung cancer, the dots will change and they can use
p298
aVsoftware to analyze the results.
p299
aVThis can radically improve the way that doctors diagnose patients.
p300
aVCurrently, they're using a method of trial and error,
p301
aVbut this could tell you precisely what disease you have.
p302
aa(lp303
VKS: So that was the six we had for you today, but I hope you're starting to see
p304
aVwhy we find these things so fascinating.
p305
aVBecause every one of these six changed our understanding
p306
aVof what was possible in the world. Prior to seeing this,
p307
aVwe would have assumed: a 10-foot pole couldn't fit in your pocket;
p308
aVsomething as inexpensive as ink couldn't sense the way paper is being bent;
p309
aVevery one of these things \u2014 and we're constantly trying to find more.
p310
aa(lp311
VZK: This is something that Keith and I really enjoy doing.
p312
aVI'm sure it's obvious to you now, but it was actually yesterday
p313
aVthat I was reminded of why. I was having a conversation
p314
aVwith Steve Jurvetson, over downstairs by the escalators,
p315
aVand he was telling me that when Chris sent out that little box,
p316
aVone of the items in it was the hydrophobic sand \u2014
p317
aVthe sand that doesn't get wet. He said that he was playing with it with his son.
p318
aVAnd you know, his son was mesmerized,
p319
aVbecause he would dunk it in the water, he would take it out
p320
aVand it was bone dry. A few weeks later, he said that his son
p321
aVwas playing with a lock of his mother's hair, and he noticed
p322
aVthat there were some drops of water on the hair.
p323
aVAnd he took the thing and he looked up to Steve and he said,
p324
aV"Look, hydrophobic string."
p325
aV(Laughter)
p326
aVI mean, after hearing that story \u2014 that really summed it up for me.
p327
aVThank you very much.
p328
aa(lp329
VKS: Thank you.
