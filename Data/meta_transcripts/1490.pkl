VSo, last month, the Encyclopaedia Britannica announced
p4
aVthat it is going out of print
p5
aVafter 244 years, which made me nostalgic,
p6
aVbecause I remember playing a game with the colossal encyclopedia set in my hometown library
p7
aVback when I was a kid,
p8
aVmaybe 12 years old.
p9
aVAnd I wondered if I could update that game,
p10
aVnot just for modern methods,
p11
aVbut for the modern me.
p12
aa(lp13
VSo I tried.
p14
aVI went to an online encyclopedia,
p15
aVWikipedia, and I entered the term "Earth."
p16
aVYou can start anywhere, this time I chose Earth.
p17
aVAnd the first rule of the game is pretty simple.
p18
aVYou just have to read the article
p19
aVuntil you find something you don't know,
p20
aVand preferably something your dad doesn't even know.
p21
aa(lp22
VAnd in this case, I quickly found this:
p23
aVThe furthest point from the center of the Earth
p24
aVis not the tip of Mount Everest, like I might have thought,
p25
aVit's the tip of this mountain: Mount Chimborazo in Ecuador.
p26
aVThe Earth spins, of course, as it travels around the sun,
p27
aVso the Earth bulges a little bit around the middle,
p28
aVlike some Earthlings.
p29
aVAnd even though Mount Chimborazo isn't the tallest mountain in the Andes,
p30
aVit's one degree away from the equator,
p31
aVit's riding that bulge, and so the summit of Chimborazo
p32
aVis the farthest point on Earth from the center of the Earth.
p33
aa(lp34
VAnd it is really fun to say.
p35
aVSo I immediately decided,
p36
aVthis is going to be the name of the game,
p37
aVor my new exclamation.
p38
aVYou can use it at TED.
p39
aVChimborazo, right?
p40
aVIt's like "eureka" and "bingo" had a baby.
p41
aVI didn't know that;
p42
aVthat's pretty cool.
p43
aVChimborazo!
p44
aa(lp45
VSo the next rule of the game is also pretty simple.
p46
aVYou just have to find another term and look that up.
p47
aVNow in the old days, that meant getting out a volume
p48
aVand browsing through it alphabetically,
p49
aVmaybe getting sidetracked,
p50
aVthat was fun.
p51
aa(lp52
VNowadays there are hundreds of links to choose from.
p53
aVI can go literally anywhere in the world,
p54
aVI think since I was already in Ecuador,
p55
aVI just decided to click on the word "tropical."
p56
aVThat took me to this wet and warm band of the tropics
p57
aVthat encircles the Earth.
p58
aa(lp59
VNow that's the Tropic of Cancer in the north
p60
aVand the Tropic of Capricorn in the south,
p61
aVthat much I knew,
p62
aVbut I was surprised to learn this little fact:
p63
aVThose are not cartographers' lines,
p64
aVlike latitude or the borders between nations,
p65
aVthey are astronomical phenomena caused by the Earth's tilt,
p66
aVand they change.
p67
aVThey move; they go up, they go down.
p68
aVIn fact, for years, the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn
p69
aVhave been steadily drifting towards the equator
p70
aVat the rate of about 15 meters per year,
p71
aVand nobody told me that.
p72
aVI didn't know it.
p73
aVChimborazo!
p74
aa(lp75
VSo to keep the game going, I just have to find another term and look that one up.
p76
aVSince I'm already in the tropics, I chose "Tropical rainforest."
p77
aVFamous for its diversity, human diversity.
p78
aVThere are still dozens and dozens of uncontacted tribes living on this planet.
p79
aVThey're all over the globe, but virtually all of them live in tropical rainforests.
p80
aVThis is the only place you can go nowadays and not get "friended."
p81
aa(lp82
VThe link that I clicked on here was exotic in the beginning and then absolutely mysterious at the very end.
p83
aVIt mentioned leopards and ring-tailed coatis and poison dart frogs and boa constrictors and then
p84
aVcoleoptera,
p85
aVwhich turn out to be beetles.
p86
aa(lp87
VNow I clicked on this on purpose,
p88
aVbut if I'd somehow gotten here by mistake,
p89
aVit does remind me, for the band, see "The Beatles,"
p90
aVfor the car see "Volkswagon Beetle,"
p91
aVbut I am here for beetle beetles.
p92
aVThis is the most successful order on the planet by far.
p93
aVSomething between 20 and 25 percent of all life forms on the planet,
p94
aVincluding plants, are beetles.
p95
aVThat means the next time you are in the grocery store,
p96
aVtake a look at the four people ahead of you in line.
p97
aVStatistically, one of you is a beetle.
p98
aa(lp99
VAnd if it is you, you are astonishingly well adapted.
p100
aVThere are scavenger beetles that pick the skin and flesh off of bones in museums.
p101
aVThere are predator beetles, that attack other insects
p102
aVand still look pretty cute to us.
p103
aVThere are beetles that roll little balls of dung
p104
aVgreat distances across the desert floor to feed to their hatchlings.
p105
aVThis reminded the ancient Egyptians of their god Khepri,
p106
aVwho renews the ball of the sun every morning,
p107
aVwhich is how that dung-rolling scarab
p108
aVbecame that sacred scarab on the breastplate of the Pharaoh Tutankhamun.
p109
aa(lp110
VBeetles, I was reminded, have the most romantic flirtation in the animal kingdom.
p111
aVFireflies are not flies, fireflies are beetles.
p112
aVFireflies are coleoptera, and coleoptera communicate in other ways as well.
p113
aa(lp114
VLike my next link:
p115
aVThe chemical language of pheromones.
p116
aVNow the pheromone page took me to a video of a sea urchin having sex.
p117
aVYeah.
p118
aa(lp119
V(Laughter)
p120
aa(lp121
VAnd the link to aphrodisiac.
p122
aVNow that's something that increases sexual desire,
p123
aVpossibly chocolate.
p124
aVThere is a compound in chocolate called phenethylamine
p125
aVthat might be an aphrodisiac.
p126
aVBut as the article mentions,
p127
aVbecause of enzyme breakdown,
p128
aVit's unlikely that phenethylamine will reach your brain if taken orally.
p129
aVSo those of you who only eat your chocolate, you might have to experiment.
p130
aa(lp131
VThe link I clicked on here,
p132
aV"sympathetic magic," mostly because I understand what both of those words mean.
p133
aVBut not when they're together like that.
p134
aVI do like sympathy. I do like magic.
p135
aVSo when I click on "sympathetic magic,"
p136
aVI get sympathetic magic and voodoo dolls.
p137
aa(lp138
VThis is the boy in me getting lucky again.
p139
aVSympathetic magic is imitation.
p140
aVIf you imitate something, maybe you can have an effect on it.
p141
aVThat's the idea behind voodoo dolls, and possibly also cave paintings.
p142
aa(lp143
VThe link to cave paintings takes me to some of the oldest art known to humankind.
p144
aVI would love to see Google maps inside some of these caves.
p145
aVWe've got tens-of-thousands-years-old artwork.
p146
aVCommon themes around the globe include large wild animals and tracings of human hands,
p147
aVusually the left hand.
p148
aa(lp149
VWe have been a dominantly right-handed tribe for millenia,
p150
aVso even though I don't know why a paleolithic person would trace his hand
p151
aVor blow pigment on it from a tube,
p152
aVI can easily picture how he did it.
p153
aVAnd I really don't think it's that different form our own little dominant hand avatar
p154
aVright there that I'm going to use now to click on the term for "hand,"
p155
aVgo to the page for "hand," where I found the most fun and possibly embarrassing bit of trivia
p156
aVI've found in a long time. It's simply this:
p157
aVThe back of the hand is formally called the opisthenar.
p158
aa(lp159
VNow that's embarrassing, because up until now,
p160
aVevery time I've said, "I know it like the back of my hand,"
p161
aVI've really been saying, "I'm totally familiar with that,
p162
aVI just don't know it's freaking name, right?"
p163
aVAnd the link I clicked on here,
p164
aVwell, lemurs, monkeys and chimpanzees have the little opisthenar.
p165
aa(lp166
VI click on chimpanzee, and I get our closest genetic relative.
p167
aVPan troglodytes, the name we give him, means "cave dweller."
p168
aVHe doesn't.
p169
aVHe lives in rainforests and savannas.
p170
aVIt's just that we're always thinking of this guy as lagging behind us,
p171
aVevolutionarily or somehow uncannily creeping up on us,
p172
aVand in some cases, he gets places before us.
p173
aa(lp174
VLike my next link, the almost irresistible link, Ham the Astrochimp.
p175
aVI click on him, and I really thought he was going to bring me full circle twice, in fact.
p176
aVHe's born in Cameroon,
p177
aVwhich is smack in the middle of my tropics map,
p178
aVand more specifically his skeleton wound up in the Smithsonian museum getting picked clean by beetles.
p179
aa(lp180
VIn between those two landmarks in Ham's life,
p181
aVhe flew into space.
p182
aVHe experienced weightlessness and re-entry
p183
aVmonths before the first human being to do it,
p184
aVSoviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin.
p185
aa(lp186
VWhen I click on Yuri Gagarin's page,
p187
aVI get this guy who was surprisingly short in stature,
p188
aVhuge in heroism.
p189
aVTop estimates, Soviet estimates, put this guy at 1.65 meters,
p190
aVthat is less than five and a half feet tall max,
p191
aVpossibly because he was malnourished as a child.
p192
aa(lp193
VGermans occupied Russia.
p194
aVA Nazi officer took over the Gagarin household,
p195
aVand he and his family built and lived in a mud hut.
p196
aVYears later, the boy from that cramped mud hut
p197
aVwould grow up to be the man in that cramped capsule
p198
aVon the tip of a rocket
p199
aVwho volunteered to be launched into outer space,
p200
aVthe first one of any of us to really physically leave this planet.
p201
aVAnd he didn't just leave it,
p202
aVhe circled it once.
p203
aa(lp204
VFifty years later, as a tribute,
p205
aVthe International Space Station, which is still up there tonight,
p206
aVsynced its orbit with Gagarin's orbit,
p207
aVat the exact same time of day,
p208
aVand filmed it,
p209
aVso you can go online and you can watch over 100 minutes
p210
aVof what must have been an absolutely mesmerizing ride,
p211
aVpossibly a lonely one,
p212
aVthe first person to ever see such a thing.
p213
aa(lp214
VAnd then when you've had your fill of that,
p215
aVyou can click on one more link.
p216
aVYou can come back to Earth.
p217
aVYou return to where you started.
p218
aVYou can finish your game.
p219
aVYou just need to find one more fact that you didn't know.
p220
aa(lp221
VAnd for me, I quickly landed on this one:
p222
aVThe Earth has a tolerance of about .17 percent from the reference spheroid,
p223
aVwhich is less than the .22 percent allowed in billiard balls.
p224
aa(lp225
VThis is the kind of fact I would have loved as a boy.
p226
aVI found it myself.
p227
aVIt's got some math that I can do.
p228
aVI'm pretty sure my dad doesn't know it.
p229
aVWhat this means is that if you could shrink the Earth to the size of a billiard ball,
p230
aVif you could take planet Earth, with all its mountain tops and caves
p231
aVand rainforests, astronauts and uncontacted tribes and chimpanzees, voodoo dolls,
p232
aVfireflies, chocolate, sea creatures making love in the deep blue sea,
p233
aVyou just shrink that to the size of a billiard ball,
p234
aVit would be as smooth as a billiard ball,
p235
aVpresumably a billiard ball with a slight bulge around the middle.
p236
aa(lp237
VThat's pretty cool.
p238
aVI didn't know that.
p239
aVChimborazo!
p240
aa(lp241
VThank you.
