VIt was the middle of summer and well past closing time
p4
aVin the downtown Berkeley bar where my friend Polly and I
p5
aVworked together as bartenders.
p6
aVUsually at the end of our shift we had a drink \u2014 but not that night.
p7
aV"I'm pregnant.
p8
aVNot sure what I'm going to do yet," I told Polly.
p9
aVWithout hesitation, she replied, "I've had an abortion."
p10
aVBefore Polly, no one had ever told me that she'd had an abortion.
p11
aVI'd graduated from college just a few months earlier
p12
aVand I was in a new relationship when I found out that I was pregnant.
p13
aVWhen I thought about my choices, I honestly did not know how to decide,
p14
aVwhat criteria I should use.
p15
aVHow would I know what the right decision was?
p16
aVI worried that I would regret  an abortion later.
p17
aVComing of age on the beaches of Southern California,
p18
aVI grew up in the middle of  our nation's abortion wars.
p19
aVI was born in a trailer on the third anniversary of Roe vs. Wade.
p20
aVOur community was surfing Christians.
p21
aVWe cared about God, the less fortunate, and the ocean.
p22
aVEveryone was pro-life.
p23
aVAs a kid, the idea of abortion made me so sad that I knew if I ever got pregnant
p24
aVI could never have one.
p25
aVAnd then I did.
p26
aVIt was a step towards the unknown.
p27
aVBut Polly had given me a very special gift:
p28
aVthe knowledge that I wasn't alone
p29
aVand the realization that abortion was something that we can talk about.
p30
aVAbortion is common.
p31
aVAccording to the Guttmacher Institute, one in three women in America
p32
aVwill have an abortion in their lifetime.
p33
aVBut for the last few decades, the dialogue around abortion in the United States
p34
aVhas left little room for anything beyond  pro-life and pro-choice.
p35
aVIt's political and polarizing.
p36
aa(lp37
VBut as much as abortion is hotly debated, it's still rare for us,
p38
aVwhether as fellow women or even just as fellow people,
p39
aVto talk with one another about the abortions that we have.
p40
aVThere is a gap.
p41
aVBetween what happens in politics and what happens in real life,
p42
aVand in that gap, a battlefield mentality.
p43
aVAn "are you with us  or against us?" stance takes root.
p44
aVThis isn't just about abortion.
p45
aVThere are so many important issues  that we can't talk about.
p46
aVAnd so finding ways to shift the conflict to a place of conversation
p47
aVis the work of my life.
p48
aVThere are two main ways to get started.
p49
aVOne way is to listen closely.
p50
aVAnd the other way is to share stories.
p51
aVSo, 15 years ago, I cofounded an organization called Exhale
p52
aVto start listening to people  who have had abortions.
p53
aVThe first thing we did was create  a talk-line, where women and men
p54
aVcould call to get emotional support.
p55
aVFree of judgment and politics, believe it or not, nothing like our sevice
p56
aVhad ever existed.
p57
aVWe needed a new framework that could  hold all the experiences that we were
p58
aVhearing on our talk-line.
p59
aVThe feminist who regrets her abortion.
p60
aVThe Catholic who is grateful for hers.
p61
aVThe personal experiences that weren't  fitting neatly into one box or the other.
p62
aVWe didn't think it was right  to ask women to pick a side.
p63
aVWe wanted to show them that the whole world was on their side,
p64
aVas they were going through this deeply personal experience.
p65
aVSo we invented "pro-voice."
p66
aa(lp67
VBeyond abortion, pro-voice works on hard issues that we've struggled with globally
p68
aVfor years,
p69
aVissues like immigration, religious tolerance, violence against women.
p70
aVIt also works on deeply personal topics  that might only matter to you
p71
aVand your immediate family and friends.
p72
aVThey have a terminal illness,  their mother just died,
p73
aVthey have a child with special needs and they can't talk about it.
p74
aVListening and storytelling are the hallmarks of pro-voice practice.
p75
aVListening and storytelling.
p76
aVThat sounds pretty nice.
p77
aVSounds maybe, easy? We could all do that.
p78
aVIt's not easy. It's very hard.
p79
aVPro-voice is hard because we are talking about things everyone's fighting about
p80
aVor the things that no one  wants to talk about.
p81
aVI wish I could tell you that when you  decide to be pro-voice, that you'll find
p82
aVbeautiful moments of breakthrough  and gardens full of flowers,
p83
aVwhere listening and storytelling creates wonderful "a-ha" moments.
p84
aVI wish I could tell you that there would be a feminist welcoming party for you,
p85
aVor that there's a long-lost sisterhood of people who are just ready
p86
aVto have your back when you get slammed.
p87
aVBut it can be vulnerable and exhausting  to tell our own stories
p88
aVwhen it feels like nobody cares.
p89
aVAnd if we truly listen to one another,
p90
aVwe will hear things that demand that we shift our own perceptions.
p91
aVThere is no perfect time and there is no perfect place
p92
aVto start a difficult conversation.
p93
aVThere's never a time when everyone will be on the same page, share the same lens,
p94
aVor know the same history.
p95
aVSo, let's talk about listening and how to be a good listener.
p96
aVThere's lots of ways to be a good listener and I'm going to give you just a couple.
p97
aVOne is to ask open-ended questions.
p98
aVYou can ask yourself or someone  that you know,
p99
aV"How are you feeling?"
p100
aV"What was that like?"
p101
aV"What do you hope for, now?"
p102
aVAnother way to be a good listener  is to use reflective language.
p103
aVIf someone is talking about their own personal experience,
p104
aVuse the words that they use.
p105
aVIf someone is talking about an abortion and they say the word "baby,"
p106
aVyou can say "baby."
p107
aVIf they say "fetus," you can say "fetus."
p108
aVIf someone describes themselves as gender queer to you,
p109
aVyou can say "gender queer."
p110
aVIf someone kind of looks like a he, but they say they're a she \u2014 it's cool.
p111
aVCall that person a she.
p112
aVWhen we reflect the language of the person who is sharing their own story,
p113
aVwe are conveying that we are interested in understanding who they are
p114
aVand what they're going through.
p115
aVThe same way that we hope people are  interested in knowing us.
p116
aVSo, I'll never forget being in one  of the Exhale counselor meetings,
p117
aVlistening to a volunteer talk about how she was getting a lot of calls
p118
aVfrom Christian women who  were talking about God.
p119
aVNow, some of our volunteers are religious, but this particular one was not.
p120
aVAt first, it felt a little weird for her  to talk to callers about God.
p121
aVSo, she decided to get comfortable.
p122
aVAnd she stood in front of her mirror  at home, and she said the word "God."
p123
aV"God."
p124
aV"God."
p125
aV"God."
p126
aV"God."
p127
aV"God."
p128
aV"God."
p129
aVOver and over and over again until the word no longer felt strange
p130
aVcoming out her mouth.
p131
aVSaying the word God did not turn this  volunteer into a Christian,
p132
aVbut it did make her a much  better listener of Christian women.
p133
aVSo, another way to be pro-voice is to share stories,
p134
aVand one risk that you take on, when you share your story with someone else,
p135
aVis that given the same set of circumstances as you
p136
aVthey might actually make a different decision.
p137
aVFor example, if you're telling a story  about your abortion,
p138
aVrealize that she might have had the baby.
p139
aVShe might have placed for adoption.
p140
aVShe might have told her parents  and her partner \u2014 or not.
p141
aVShe might have felt relief and confidence, even though you felt sad and lost.
p142
aVThis is okay.
p143
aVEmpathy gets created the moment we imagine ourselves in someone else's shoes.
p144
aVIt doesn't mean we all have  to end up in the same place.
p145
aVIt's not agreement, it's not sameness that pro-voice is after.
p146
aVIt creates a culture and a society that  values what make us special and unique.
p147
aVIt values what makes us human, our flaws and our imperfections.
p148
aVAnd this way of thinking allows us to see our differences with respect,
p149
aVinstead of fear.
p150
aVAnd it generates the empathy that we need
p151
aVto overcome all the ways that we try to hurt one another.
p152
aVStigma, shame, prejudice,  discrimination, oppression.
p153
aVPro-voice is contagious, and the more it's practiced
p154
aVthe more it spreads.
p155
aVSo, last year I was pregnant again.
p156
aVThis time I was looking forward  to the birth of my son.
p157
aVAnd while pregnant, I had never been asked how I was feeling so much in all my life.
p158
aV(Laughter)
p159
aVAnd however I replied, whether I was feeling wonderful and excited
p160
aVor scared and totally freaked out,
p161
aVthere was always someone there giving me a "been there" response.
p162
aVIt was awesome.
p163
aVIt was a welcome, yet dramatic departure from what I experience
p164
aVwhen I talk about my mixed feelings of my abortion.
p165
aVPro-voice is about the real stories of real people
p166
aVmaking an impact on the way abortion
p167
aVand so many other politicized and stigmatized issues
p168
aVare understood and discussed.
p169
aVFrom sexuality and mental health to poverty and incarceration.
p170
aVFar beyond definition as single right or wrong decisions,
p171
aVour experiences can exist on a spectrum.
p172
aVPro-voice focuses that conversation on human experience
p173
aVand it makes support and respect possible for all.
p174
aVThank you.
