VPat Mitchell: What is the story of this pin?
p4
aa(lp5
VMadeleine Albright: This is "Breaking the Glass Ceiling."
p6
aa(lp7
VPM: Oh.
p8
aVThat was well chosen, I would say, for TEDWomen.
p9
aa(lp10
VMA: Most of the time I spend when I get up in the morning
p11
aVis trying to figure out what is going to happen.
p12
aVAnd none of this pin stuff would have happened
p13
aVif it hadn't been for Saddam Hussein.
p14
aVI'll tell you what happened.
p15
aVI went to the United Nations as an ambassador,
p16
aVand it was after the Gulf War,
p17
aVand I was an instructed ambassador.
p18
aVAnd the cease-fire had been translated
p19
aVinto a series of sanctions resolutions,
p20
aVand my instructions
p21
aVwere to say perfectly terrible things about Saddam Hussein constantly,
p22
aVwhich he deserved \u2014 he had invaded another country.
p23
aVAnd so all of a sudden, a poem appeared in the papers in Baghdad
p24
aVcomparing me to many things,
p25
aVbut among them an "unparalleled serpent."
p26
aVAnd so I happened to have a snake pin.
p27
aVSo I wore it when we talked about Iraq.
p28
aV(Laughter)
p29
aVAnd when I went out to meet the press,
p30
aVthey zeroed in, said, "Why are you wearing that snake pin?"
p31
aVI said, "Because Saddam Hussein compared me to an unparalleled serpent."
p32
aVAnd then I thought, well this is fun.
p33
aVSo I went out and I bought a lot of pins
p34
aVthat would, in fact, reflect
p35
aVwhat I thought we were going to do on any given day.
p36
aVSo that's how it all started.
p37
aa(lp38
VPM: So how large is the collection?
p39
aa(lp40
VMA: Pretty big.
p41
aVIt's now traveling.
p42
aVAt the moment it's in Indianapolis,
p43
aVbut it was at the Smithsonian.
p44
aVAnd it goes with a book that says, "Read My Pins."
p45
aa(lp46
V(Laughter)
p47
aa(lp48
VPM: So is this a good idea.
p49
aVI remember when you were the first woman
p50
aVas Secretary of State,
p51
aVand there was a lot of conversation always
p52
aVabout what you were wearing,
p53
aVhow you looked \u2014
p54
aVthe thing that happens to a lot of women,
p55
aVespecially if they're the first in a position.
p56
aVSo how do you feel about that \u2014 the whole \u2014
p57
aa(lp58
VMA: Well, it's pretty irritating actually
p59
aVbecause nobody ever describes what a man is wearing.
p60
aVBut people did pay attention to what clothes I had.
p61
aVWhat was interesting was that,
p62
aVbefore I went up to New York as U.N. ambassador,
p63
aVI talked to Jeane Kirkpatrick, who'd been ambassador before me,
p64
aVand she said, "You've got to get rid of your professor clothes.
p65
aVGo out and look like a diplomat."
p66
aVSo that did give me a lot of opportunities to go shopping.
p67
aVBut still, there were all kinds of questions
p68
aVabout \u2014 "did you wear a hat?" "How short was your skirt?"
p69
aVAnd one of the things \u2014
p70
aVif you remember Condoleezza Rice was at some event and she wore boots,
p71
aVand she got criticized over that.
p72
aVAnd no guy ever gets criticized. But that's the least of it.
p73
aa(lp74
VPM: It is, for all of us, men and women,
p75
aVfinding our ways of defining our roles,
p76
aVand doing them in ways that make a difference in the world
p77
aVand shape the future.
p78
aVHow did you handle that balance
p79
aVbetween being the tough diplomatic
p80
aVand strong voice of this country
p81
aVto the rest of the world
p82
aVand also how you felt about yourself
p83
aVas a mother, a grandmother, nurturing ...
p84
aVand so how did you handle that?
p85
aa(lp86
VMA: Well the interesting part was I was asked
p87
aVwhat it was like to be the first woman Secretary of State
p88
aVa few minutes after I'd been named.
p89
aVAnd I said, "Well I've been a woman for 60 years,
p90
aVbut I've only been Secretary of State for a few minutes."
p91
aVSo it evolved.
p92
aV(Laughter)
p93
aVBut basically I love being a woman.
p94
aVAnd so what happened \u2014
p95
aVand I think there will probably be some people in the audience
p96
aVthat will identify with this \u2014
p97
aVI went to my first meeting, first at the U.N.,
p98
aVand that's when this all started,
p99
aVbecause that is a very male organization.
p100
aVAnd I'm sitting there \u2014 there are 15 members of the Security Council \u2014
p101
aVso 14 men sat there staring at me,
p102
aVand I thought \u2014 well you know how we all are.
p103
aVYou want to get the feeling of the room,
p104
aVand "do people like me?"
p105
aVand "will I really say something intelligent?"
p106
aVAnd all of a sudden I thought, "Well, wait a minute.
p107
aVI am sitting behind a sign that says 'The United States,'
p108
aVand if I don't speak today
p109
aVthen the voice of the United States will not be heard,"
p110
aVand it was the first time that I had that feeling
p111
aVthat I had to step out of myself
p112
aVin my normal, reluctant female mode
p113
aVand decide that I had to speak on behalf of our country.
p114
aVAnd so that happened more at various times,
p115
aVbut I really think that there was a great advantage in many ways
p116
aVto being a woman.
p117
aVI think we are a lot better
p118
aVat personal relationships,
p119
aVand then have the capability obviously
p120
aVof telling it like it is when it's necessary.
p121
aVBut I have to tell you, I have my youngest granddaughter,
p122
aVwhen she turned seven last year,
p123
aVsaid to her mother, my daughter,
p124
aV"So what's the big deal about Grandma Maddie being Secretary of State?
p125
aVOnly girls are Secretary of State."
p126
aa(lp127
V(Laughter)
p128
aa(lp129
V(Applause)
p130
aa(lp131
VPM: Because in her lifetime \u2014 MA: That would be so.
p132
aa(lp133
VPM: What a change that is.
p134
aVAs you travel now all over the world,
p135
aVwhich you do frequently,
p136
aVhow do you assess
p137
aVthis global narrative around the story of women and girls?
p138
aVWhere are we?
p139
aa(lp140
VMA: I think we're slowly changing,
p141
aVbut obviously there are whole pockets
p142
aVin countries where nothing is different.
p143
aVAnd therefore it means that we have to remember
p144
aVthat, while many of us have had huge opportunities \u2014
p145
aVand Pat, you have been a real leader in your field \u2014
p146
aVis that there are a lot of women
p147
aVthat are not capable
p148
aVof worrying and taking care of themselves
p149
aVand understanding that women have to help other women.
p150
aVAnd so what I have felt \u2014
p151
aVand I have looked at this
p152
aVfrom a national security issue \u2014
p153
aVwhen I was Secretary of State, I decided
p154
aVthat women's issues had to be central to American foreign policy,
p155
aVnot just because I'm a feminist,
p156
aVbut because I believe that societies are better off
p157
aVwhen women are politically and economically empowered,
p158
aVthat values are passed down,
p159
aVthe health situation is better,
p160
aVeducation is better,
p161
aVthere is greater economic prosperity.
p162
aVSo I think that it behooves us \u2014
p163
aVthose of us that live in various countries
p164
aVwhere we do have economic and political voice \u2014
p165
aVthat we need to help other women.
p166
aVAnd I really dedicated myself to that,
p167
aVboth at the U.N. and then as Secretary of State.
p168
aa(lp169
VPM: And did you get pushback
p170
aVfrom making that a central tenant of foreign policy?
p171
aa(lp172
VMA: From some people.
p173
aVI think that they thought that it was a soft issue.
p174
aVThe bottom line that I decided
p175
aVwas actually women's issues are the hardest issues,
p176
aVbecause they are the ones that have to do with life and death
p177
aVin so many aspects,
p178
aVand because, as I said,
p179
aVit is really central to the way that we think about things.
p180
aVNow for instance,
p181
aVsome of the wars that took place
p182
aVwhen I was in office,
p183
aVa lot of them, the women were the main victims of it.
p184
aVFor instance, when I started,
p185
aVthere were wars in the Balkans.
p186
aVThe women in Bosnia were being raped.
p187
aVWe then managed to set up a war crimes tribunal
p188
aVto deal specifically with those kinds of issues.
p189
aVAnd by the way, one of the things that I did at that stage
p190
aVwas, I had just arrived at the U.N.,
p191
aVand when I was there, there were 183 countries in the U.N.
p192
aVNow there are 192.
p193
aVBut it was one of the first times that I didn't have to cook lunch myself.
p194
aVSo I said to my assistant,
p195
aV"Invite the other women permanent representatives."
p196
aVAnd I thought when I'd get to my apartment
p197
aVthat there'd be a lot of women there.
p198
aVI get there, and there are six other women, out of 183.
p199
aVSo the countries that had women representatives
p200
aVwere Canada, Kazakhstan, Philippines,
p201
aVTrinidad Tobago, Jamaica,
p202
aVLichtenstein and me.
p203
aVSo being an American, I decided to set up a caucus.
p204
aV(Laughter)
p205
aVAnd so we set it up,
p206
aVand we called ourselves the G7.
p207
aa(lp208
V(Laughter)
p209
aa(lp210
VPM: Is that "Girl 7?" MA: Girl 7.
p211
aa(lp212
VAnd we lobbied
p213
aVon behalf of women's issues.
p214
aVSo we managed to get two women judges
p215
aVon this war crimes tribunal.
p216
aVAnd then what happened
p217
aVwas that they were able to declare that rape was a weapon of war,
p218
aVthat it was against humanity.
p219
aa(lp220
V(Applause)
p221
aa(lp222
VPM: So when you look around the world
p223
aVand you see that, in many cases \u2014
p224
aVcertainly in the Western world \u2014
p225
aVwomen are evolving into more leadership positions,
p226
aVand even other places
p227
aVsome barriers are being brought down,
p228
aVbut there's still so much violence,
p229
aVstill so many problems,
p230
aVand yet we hear there are more women
p231
aVat the negotiating tables.
p232
aVNow you were at those negotiating tables
p233
aVwhen they weren't, when there was maybe you \u2014
p234
aVone voice, maybe one or two others.
p235
aVDo you believe, and can you tell us why,
p236
aVthere is going to be a significant shift
p237
aVin things like violence
p238
aVand peace and conflict and resolution
p239
aVon a sustainable basis?
p240
aa(lp241
VMA: Well I do think, when there are more women,
p242
aVthat the tone of the conversation changes,
p243
aVand also the goals of the conversation change.
p244
aVBut it doesn't mean that the whole world
p245
aVwould be a lot better
p246
aVif it were totally run by women.
p247
aVIf you think that, you've forgotten high school.
p248
aV(Laughter)
p249
aVBut the bottom line
p250
aVis that there is a way,
p251
aVwhen there are more women at the table,
p252
aVthat there's an attempt
p253
aVto develop some understanding.
p254
aVSo for instance, what I did when I went to Burundi,
p255
aVwe'd got Tutsi and Hutu women together
p256
aVto talk about some of the problems
p257
aVthat had taken place in Rwanda.
p258
aVAnd so I think the capability of women
p259
aVto put themselves \u2014
p260
aVI think we're better about putting ourselves into the other guy's shoes
p261
aVand having more empathy.
p262
aVI think it helps in terms of the support
p263
aVif there are other women in the room.
p264
aa(lp265
VWhen I was Secretary of State,
p266
aVthere were only 13 other women foreign ministers.
p267
aVAnd so it was nice when one of them would show up.
p268
aVFor instance, she is now the president of Finland,
p269
aVbut Tarja Halonen was the foreign minister of Finland
p270
aVand, at a certain stage, head of the European Union.
p271
aVAnd it was really terrific.
p272
aVBecause one of the things I think you'll understand.
p273
aVWe went to a meeting,
p274
aVand the men in my delegation,
p275
aVwhen I would say, "Well I feel we should do something about this,"
p276
aVand they'd say, "What do you mean, you feel?"
p277
aVAnd so then Tarja was sitting across the table from me.
p278
aVAnd all of a sudden we were talking about arms control,
p279
aVand she said, "Well I feel we should do this."
p280
aVAnd my male colleagues kind of got it all of a sudden.
p281
aVBut I think it really does help
p282
aVto have a critical mass of women
p283
aVin a series of foreign policy positions.
p284
aVThe other thing that I think is really important:
p285
aVA lot of national security policy
p286
aVisn't just about foreign policy,
p287
aVbut it's about budgets, military budgets,
p288
aVand how the debts of countries work out.
p289
aVSo if you have women
p290
aVin a variety of foreign policy posts,
p291
aVthey can support each other
p292
aVwhen there are budget decisions being made in their own countries.
p293
aa(lp294
VPM: So how do we get
p295
aVthis balance we're looking for, then, in the world?
p296
aVMore women's voices at the table?
p297
aVMore men who believe
p298
aVthat the balance is best?
p299
aa(lp300
VMA: Well I think one of the things \u2014
p301
aVI'm chairman of the board of an organization
p302
aVcalled the National Democratic Institute
p303
aVthat works to support women candidates.
p304
aVI think that we need
p305
aVto help in other countries
p306
aVto train women
p307
aVto be in political office,
p308
aVto figure out how they can in fact
p309
aVdevelop political voices.
p310
aVI think we also need to be supportive
p311
aVwhen businesses are being created
p312
aVand just make sure that women help each other.
p313
aVNow I have a saying
p314
aVthat I feel very strongly about,
p315
aVbecause I am of a certain age
p316
aVwhere, when I started in my career,
p317
aVbelieve it or not, there were other women who criticized me:
p318
aV"Why aren't you in the carpool line?"
p319
aVor "Aren't your children suffering
p320
aVbecause you're not there all the time?"
p321
aVAnd I think we have a tendency to make each other feel guilty.
p322
aVIn fact, I think "guilt" is every woman's middle name.
p323
aVAnd so I think what needs to happen
p324
aVis we need to help each other.
p325
aVAnd my motto is that there's a special place in hell
p326
aVfor women who don't help each other.
p327
aa(lp328
V(Applause)
p329
aa(lp330
VPM: Well Secretary Albright, I guess you'll be going to heaven.
p331
aVThank you for joining us today.
