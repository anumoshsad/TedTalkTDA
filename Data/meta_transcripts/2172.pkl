VOn June 12, 2014, precisely at 3:33
p4
aVin a balmy winter afternoon in São Paulo, Brazil,
p5
aVa typical South American winter afternoon,
p6
aVthis kid, this young man  that you see celebrating here
p7
aVlike he had scored a goal,
p8
aVJuliano Pinto, 29 years old, accomplished a magnificent deed.
p9
aVDespite being paralyzed
p10
aVand not having any sensation from mid-chest to the tip of his toes
p11
aVas the result of a car crash six years ago that killed his brother
p12
aVand produced a complete spinal cord lesion that left Juliano in a wheelchair,
p13
aVJuliano rose to the occasion, and on this day did something
p14
aVthat pretty much everybody that saw him  in the six years deemed impossible.
p15
aVJuliano Pinto delivered the opening kick
p16
aVof the 2014 Brazilian  World Soccer Cup here
p17
aVjust by thinking.
p18
aVHe could not move his body,
p19
aVbut he could imagine the movements needed to kick a ball.
p20
aVHe was an athlete before the lesion. He's a para-athlete right now.
p21
aVHe's going to be in the Paralympic Games, I hope, in a couple years.
p22
aVBut what the spinal cord lesion  did not rob from Juliano
p23
aVwas his ability to dream.
p24
aVAnd dream he did that afternoon, for a stadium of about 75,000 people
p25
aVand an audience of close to a billion watching on TV.
p26
aa(lp27
VAnd that kick crowned, basically, 30 years of basic research
p28
aVstudying how the brain,
p29
aVhow this amazing universe that we have between our ears
p30
aVthat is only comparable to universe that we have above our head
p31
aVbecause it has about 100 billion elements
p32
aVtalking to each other through electrical brainstorms,
p33
aVwhat Juliano accomplished took 30 years to imagine in laboratories
p34
aVand about 15 years to plan.
p35
aa(lp36
VWhen John Chapin and I, 15 years ago, proposed in a paper
p37
aVthat we would build something that we called a brain-machine interface,
p38
aVmeaning connecting a brain to devices
p39
aVso that animals and humans could just move these devices,
p40
aVno matter how far they are from their own bodies,
p41
aVjust by imagining what they want to do,
p42
aVour colleagues told us that we actually needed professional help,
p43
aVof the psychiatry variety.
p44
aVAnd despite that, a Scot and a Brazilian persevered,
p45
aVbecause that's how we were raised in our respective countries,
p46
aVand for 12, 15 years,
p47
aVwe made demonstration after demonstration suggesting that this was possible.
p48
aa(lp49
VAnd a brain-machine interface is not rocket science,
p50
aVit's just brain research.
p51
aVIt's nothing but using sensors
p52
aVto read the electrical brainstorms that a brain is producing
p53
aVto generate the motor commands
p54
aVthat have to be downloaded to the spinal cord,
p55
aVso we projected sensors that can read
p56
aVhundreds and now thousands of these brain cells simultaneously,
p57
aVand extract from these electrical signals
p58
aVthe motor planning that the brain is generating
p59
aVto actually make us move into space.
p60
aVAnd by doing that, we converted these signals into digital commands
p61
aVthat any mechanical, electronic, or even a virtual device can understand
p62
aVso that the subject can imagine what he, she or it wants to make move,
p63
aVand the device obeys that brain command.
p64
aVBy sensorizing these devices with lots of different types of sensors,
p65
aVas you are going to see in a moment,
p66
aVwe actually sent messages back to the brain to confirm
p67
aVthat that voluntary motor will was being enacted, no matter where \u2014
p68
aVnext to the subject, next door, or across the planet.
p69
aVAnd as this message gave feedback back to the brain,
p70
aVthe brain realized its goal: to make us move.
p71
aVSo this is just one experiment that we published a few years ago,
p72
aVwhere a monkey, without moving its body,
p73
aVlearned to control the movements of an avatar arm,
p74
aVa virtual arm that doesn't exist.
p75
aVWhat you're listening to is the sound of the brain of this monkey
p76
aVas it explores three different visually identical spheres
p77
aVin virtual space.
p78
aVAnd to get a reward, a drop of orange juice that monkeys love,
p79
aVthis animal has to detect, select one of these objects
p80
aVby touching,
p81
aVnot by seeing it, by touching it,
p82
aVbecause every time this virtual hand touches one of the objects,
p83
aVan electrical pulse goes back to the brain of the animal
p84
aVdescribing the fine texture of the surface of this object,
p85
aVso the animal can judge what is  the correct object that he has to grab,
p86
aVand if he does that, he gets a reward without moving a muscle.
p87
aVThe perfect Brazilian lunch:
p88
aVnot moving a muscle and getting your orange juice.
p89
aa(lp90
VSo as we saw this happening,
p91
aVwe actually came and proposed the idea that we had published 15 years ago.
p92
aVWe reenacted this paper.
p93
aVWe got it out of the drawers,
p94
aVand we proposed that perhaps we could get a human being that is paralyzed
p95
aVto actually use the brain-machine interface to regain mobility.
p96
aVThe idea was that if you suffered \u2014
p97
aVand that can happen to any one of us.
p98
aVLet me tell you, it's very sudden.
p99
aVIt's a millisecond of a collision,
p100
aVa car accident that transforms your life completely.
p101
aVIf you have a complete lesion of the spinal cord,
p102
aVyou cannot move because your brainstorms cannot reach your muscles.
p103
aVHowever, your brainstorms continue to be generated in your head.
p104
aVParaplegic, quadriplegic patients dream about moving every night.
p105
aVThey have that inside their head.
p106
aVThe problem is how to get that code out of it
p107
aVand make the movement be created again.
p108
aa(lp109
VSo what we proposed was, let's create a new body.
p110
aVLet's create a robotic vest.
p111
aVAnd that's exactly why Juliano could kick that ball just by thinking,
p112
aVbecause he was wearing the first brain-controlled robotic vest
p113
aVthat can be used by paraplegic, quadriplegic patients to move
p114
aVand to regain feedback.
p115
aa(lp116
VThat was the original idea, 15 years ago.
p117
aVWhat I'm going to show you is how 156 people from 25 countries
p118
aVall over the five continents of this beautiful Earth,
p119
aVdropped their lives, dropped their patents,
p120
aVdropped their dogs, wives, kids, school, jobs,
p121
aVand congregated to come to Brazil for 18 months to actually get this done.
p122
aVBecause a couple years after Brazil was awarded the World Cup,
p123
aVwe heard that the Brazilian government wanted to do something meaningful
p124
aVin the opening ceremony
p125
aVin the country that reinvented and perfected soccer
p126
aVuntil we met the Germans, of course.
p127
aV(Laughter)
p128
aVBut that's a different talk,
p129
aVand a different neuroscientist needs to talk about that.
p130
aVBut what Brazil wanted to do is to showcase
p131
aVa completely different country,
p132
aVa country that values science and technology,
p133
aVand can give a gift to millions, 25 million people around the world
p134
aVthat cannot move any longer because of a spinal cord injury.
p135
aVWell, we went to the Brazilian government and to FIFA and proposed,
p136
aVwell, let's have the kickoff of the 2014 World Cup
p137
aVbe given by a Brazilian paraplegic
p138
aVusing a brain-controlled exoskeleton that allows him to kick the ball
p139
aVand to feel the contact of the ball.
p140
aVThey looked at us, thought that we were completely nuts,
p141
aVand said, "Okay, let's try."
p142
aVWe had 18 months to do everything from zero, from scratch.
p143
aVWe had no exoskeleton, we had no patients,
p144
aVwe had nothing done.
p145
aVThese people came all together
p146
aVand in 18 months, we got eight patients in a routine of training
p147
aVand basically built from nothing this guy,
p148
aVthat we call Bra-Santos Dumont 1.
p149
aVThe first brain-controlled exoskeleton to be built
p150
aVwas named after the most famous Brazilian scientist ever,
p151
aVAlberto Santos Dumont,
p152
aVwho, on October 19, 1901, created and flew himself
p153
aVthe first controlled airship on air in Paris for a million people to see.
p154
aVSorry, my American friends,
p155
aVI live in North Carolina,
p156
aVbut it was two years before the Wright Brothers flew
p157
aVon the coast of North Carolina.
p158
aV(Applause)
p159
aVFlight control is Brazilian. (Laughter)
p160
aa(lp161
VSo we went together with these guys
p162
aVand we basically put this exoskeleton together,
p163
aV15 degrees of freedom, hydraulic machine
p164
aVthat can be commanded by brain signals
p165
aVrecorded by a non-invasive technology called electroencephalography
p166
aVthat can basically allow the patient to imagine the movements
p167
aVand send his commands to the controls, the motors,
p168
aVand get it done.
p169
aVThis exoskeleton was covered with an artificial skin
p170
aVinvented by Gordon Cheng, one of my greatest friends, in Munich,
p171
aVto allow sensation from the joints moving and the foot touching the ground
p172
aVto be delivered back to the patient through a vest, a shirt.
p173
aVIt is a smart shirt with micro-vibrating elements
p174
aVthat basically delivers the feedback and fools the patient's brain
p175
aVby creating a sensation that it is not a machine that is carrying him,
p176
aVbut it is he who is walking again.
p177
aa(lp178
VSo we got this going, and what you'll see here
p179
aVis the first time one of our patients, Bruno, actually walked.
p180
aVAnd he takes a few seconds because we are setting everything,
p181
aVand you are going to see a blue light cutting in front of the helmet
p182
aVbecause Bruno is going to imagine the movement that needs to be performed,
p183
aVthe computer is going to analyze it, Bruno is going to certify it,
p184
aVand when it is certified,
p185
aVthe device starts moving under the command of Bruno's brain.
p186
aVAnd he just got it right, and now he starts walking.
p187
aVAfter nine years without being able to move,
p188
aVhe is walking by himself.
p189
aVAnd more than that \u2014
p190
aV(Applause) \u2014
p191
aVmore than just walking,
p192
aVhe is feeling the ground,
p193
aVand if the speed of the exo goes up,
p194
aVhe tells us that he is walking again on the sand of Santos,
p195
aVthe beach resort where he used to go before he had the accident.
p196
aVThat's why the brain is creating a new sensation in Bruno's head.
p197
aa(lp198
VSo he walks, and at the end of the walk \u2014 I am running out of time already \u2014
p199
aVhe says, "You know, guys,
p200
aVI need to borrow this thing from you when I get married,
p201
aVbecause I wanted to walk to the priest
p202
aVand see my bride and actually be there by myself.
p203
aVOf course, he will have it whenever he wants.
p204
aa(lp205
VAnd this is what we wanted to show during the World Cup, and couldn't,
p206
aVbecause for some mysterious reason, FIFA cut its broadcast in half.
p207
aVWhat you are going to see very quickly is Juliano Pinto in the exo doing the kick
p208
aVa few minutes before we went to the pitch
p209
aVand did the real thing in front of the entire crowd,
p210
aVand the lights you are going to see just describe the operation.
p211
aVBasically, the blue lights pulsating indicate that the exo is ready to go.
p212
aVIt can receive thoughts and it can deliver feedback,
p213
aVand when Juliano makes the decision to kick the ball,
p214
aVyou are going to see two streams of green and yellow light
p215
aVcoming from the helmet and going to the legs,
p216
aVrepresenting the mental commands that were taken by the exo
p217
aVto actually make that happen.
p218
aVAnd in basically 13 seconds,
p219
aVJuliano actually did.
p220
aVYou can see the commands.
p221
aVHe gets ready,  the ball is set, and he kicks.
p222
aVAnd the most amazing thing is,
p223
aV10 seconds after he did that, and looked at us on the pitch,
p224
aVhe told us, celebrating as you saw,
p225
aV"I felt the ball."
p226
aVAnd that's priceless.
p227
aV(Applause)
p228
aa(lp229
VSo where is this going to go?
p230
aVI have two minutes to tell you
p231
aVthat it's going to the limits of your imagination.
p232
aVBrain-actuating technology is here.
p233
aVThis is the latest: We just published this a year ago,
p234
aVthe first brain-to-brain interface
p235
aVthat allows two animals to exchange mental messages
p236
aVso that one animal that sees something coming from the environment
p237
aVcan send a mental SMS, a torpedo, a neurophysiological torpedo,
p238
aVto the second animal,
p239
aVand the second animal performs the act that he needed to perform
p240
aVwithout ever knowing what the environment was sending as a message,
p241
aVbecause the message came from the first animal's brain.
p242
aa(lp243
VSo this is the first demo.
p244
aVI'm going to be very quick because I want to show you the latest.
p245
aVBut what you see here is the first rat getting informed
p246
aVby a light that is going to show up on the left of the cage
p247
aVthat he has to press the left cage to basically get a reward.
p248
aVHe goes there and does it.
p249
aVAnd the same time, he is sending a mental message
p250
aVto the second rat that didn't see any light,
p251
aVand the second rat, in 70 percent of the times
p252
aVis going to press the left lever and get a reward
p253
aVwithout ever experiencing the light in the retina.
p254
aa(lp255
VWell, we took this to a little higher limit
p256
aVby getting monkeys to collaborate  mentally in a brain net,
p257
aVbasically to donate their brain activity
p258
aVand combine them to move the virtual arm that I showed you before,
p259
aVand what you see here is the first time the two monkeys combine their brains,
p260
aVsynchronize their brains perfectly to get this virtual arm to move.
p261
aVOne monkey is controlling the x dimension,
p262
aVthe other monkey is controlling the y dimension.
p263
aVBut it gets a little more interesting when you get three monkeys in there
p264
aVand you ask one monkey to control x and y,
p265
aVthe other monkey to control y and z,
p266
aVand the third one to control x and z,
p267
aVand you make them all play the game together,
p268
aVmoving the arm in 3D into a target to get the famous Brazilian orange juice.
p269
aVAnd they actually do.
p270
aVThe black dot is the average of all these brains working
p271
aVin parallel, in real time.
p272
aVThat is the definition of a biological computer,
p273
aVinteracting by brain activity and achieving a motor goal.
p274
aa(lp275
VWhere is this going?
p276
aVWe have no idea.
p277
aVWe're just scientists.
p278
aV(Laughter)
p279
aVWe are paid to be children,
p280
aVto basically go to the edge and discover what is out there.
p281
aVBut one thing I know:
p282
aVOne day, in a few decades,
p283
aVwhen our grandchildren surf the Net just by thinking,
p284
aVor a mother donates her eyesight to an autistic kid who cannot see,
p285
aVor somebody speaks because of a brain-to-brain bypass,
p286
aVsome of you will remember that it all started on a winter afternoon
p287
aVin a Brazilian soccer field with an impossible kick.
p288
aa(lp289
VThank you.
p290
aa(lp291
V(Applause)
p292
aa(lp293
VThank you.
p294
aa(lp295
VBruno Giussani: Miguel, thank you for sticking to your time.
p296
aVI actually would have given you a couple more minutes,
p297
aVbecause there are a couple of points we want to develop, and, of course,
p298
aVclearly it seems that we need connected  brains to figure out where this is going.
p299
aVSo let's connect all this together.
p300
aVSo if I'm understanding correctly,
p301
aVone of the monkeys is actually getting a signal
p302
aVand the other monkey is reacting to that signal
p303
aVjust because the first one is receiving it and transmitting the neurological impulse.
p304
aa(lp305
VMiguel Nicolelis:  No, it's a little different.
p306
aVNo monkey knows of the existence of the other two monkeys.
p307
aVThey are getting a visual feedback in 2D,
p308
aVbut the task they have to accomplish is 3D.
p309
aVThey have to move an arm in three dimensions.
p310
aVBut each monkey is only getting the two dimensions on the video screen
p311
aVthat the monkey controls.
p312
aVAnd to get that thing done,
p313
aVyou need at least two monkeys to synchronize their brains,
p314
aVbut the ideal is three.
p315
aVSo what we found out is that when one monkey starts slacking down,
p316
aVthe other two monkeys enhance their performance
p317
aVto get the guy to come back,
p318
aVso this adjusts dynamically,
p319
aVbut the global synchrony remains the same.
p320
aVNow, if you flip without telling the monkey
p321
aVthe dimensions that each brain has to control,
p322
aVlike this guy is controlling x and y,
p323
aVbut he should be controlling now y and z,
p324
aVinstantaneously, that animal's brain forgets about the old dimensions
p325
aVand it starts concentrating on the new dimensions.
p326
aVSo what I need to say is that no Turing machine,
p327
aVno computer can predict what a brain net will do.
p328
aVSo we will absorb technology as part of us.
p329
aVTechnology will never absorb us.
p330
aVIt's simply impossible.
p331
aa(lp332
VBG: How many times have you tested this?
p333
aVAnd how many times have you succeeded versus failed?
p334
aa(lp335
VMN: Oh, tens of times.
p336
aVWith the three monkeys? Oh, several times.
p337
aVI wouldn't be able to talk about this here unless I had done it a few times.
p338
aVAnd I forgot to mention, because of time,
p339
aVthat just three weeks ago, a European group
p340
aVjust demonstrated the first man-to-man brain-to-brain connection.
p341
aVBG: And how does that play?
p342
aVMN: There was one bit of information \u2014 big ideas start in a humble way \u2014
p343
aVbut basically the brain activity of one subject
p344
aVwas transmitted to a second object, all non-invasive technology.
p345
aVSo the first subject got a message, like our rats, a visual message,
p346
aVand transmitted it to the second subject.
p347
aVThe second subject received a magnetic pulse in the visual cortex,
p348
aVor a different pulse, two different pulses.
p349
aVIn one pulse, the subject saw something.
p350
aVOn the other pulse, he saw something different.
p351
aVAnd he was able to verbally indicate
p352
aVwhat was the message the first subject was sending
p353
aVthrough the Internet across continents.
p354
aa(lp355
VModerator: Wow. Okay, that's where we are going.
p356
aVThat's the next TED Talk at the next conference.
