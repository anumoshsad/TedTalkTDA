VI'm 150 feet down an illegal mine shaft in Ghana.
p4
aVThe air is thick with heat and dust,
p5
aVand it's hard to breathe.
p6
aVI can feel the brush of sweaty bodies passing me
p7
aVin the darkness, but I can't see much else.
p8
aVI hear voices talking, but mostly the shaft
p9
aVis this cacophony of men coughing,
p10
aVand stone being broken with primitive tools.
p11
aVLike the others, I wear a flickering, cheap flashlight
p12
aVtied to my head with this elastic, tattered band,
p13
aVand I can barely make out the slick tree limbs
p14
aVholding up the walls of the three-foot square hole
p15
aVdropping hundreds of feet into the earth.
p16
aVWhen my hand slips, I suddenly remember a miner
p17
aVI had met days before who had lost his grip
p18
aVand fell countless feet down that shaft.
p19
aa(lp20
VAs I stand talking to you today,
p21
aVthese men are still deep in that hole,
p22
aVrisking their lives without payment or compensation,
p23
aVand often dying.
p24
aa(lp25
VI got to climb out of that hole, and I got to go home,
p26
aVbut they likely never will, because they're trapped in slavery.
p27
aa(lp28
VFor the last 28 years, I've been documenting
p29
aVindigenous cultures in more than 70 countries
p30
aVon six continents, and in 2009 I had the great honor
p31
aVof being the sole exhibitor at the Vancouver Peace Summit.
p32
aVAmongst all the astonishing people I met there,
p33
aVI met a supporter of Free the Slaves, an NGO
p34
aVdedicated to eradicating modern day slavery.
p35
aVWe started talking about slavery, and really,
p36
aVI started learning about slavery,
p37
aVfor I had certainly known it existed in the world,
p38
aVbut not to such a degree.
p39
aVAfter we finished talking, I felt so horrible
p40
aVand honestly ashamed at my own lack of knowledge
p41
aVof this atrocity in my own lifetime, and I thought,
p42
aVif I don't know, how many other people don't know?
p43
aVIt started burning a hole in my stomach, so within weeks,
p44
aVI flew down to Los Angeles to meet with the director
p45
aVof Free the Slaves and offer them my help.
p46
aa(lp47
VThus began my journey into modern day slavery.
p48
aVOddly, I had been to many of these places before.
p49
aVSome I even considered like my second home.
p50
aVBut this time, I would see the skeletons hidden in the closet.
p51
aa(lp52
VA conservative estimate tells us there are more than
p53
aV27 million people enslaved in the world today.
p54
aVThat's double the amount of people taken from Africa
p55
aVduring the entire trans-Atlantic slave trade.
p56
aVA hundred and fifty years ago, an agricultural slave
p57
aVcost about three times the annual salary
p58
aVof an American worker.
p59
aVThat equates to about $50,000 in today's money.
p60
aVYet today, entire families can be enslaved for generations
p61
aVover a debt as small as $18.
p62
aVAstonishingly, slavery generates profits
p63
aVof more than $13 billion worldwide each year.
p64
aa(lp65
VMany have been tricked by false promises
p66
aVof a good education, a better job, only to find
p67
aVthat they're forced to work without pay
p68
aVunder the threat of violence, and they cannot walk away.
p69
aa(lp70
VToday's slavery is about commerce,
p71
aVso the goods that enslaved people produce have value,
p72
aVbut the people producing them are disposable.
p73
aVSlavery exists everywhere, nearly, in the world,
p74
aVand yet it is illegal everywhere in the world.
p75
aa(lp76
VIn India and Nepal, I was introduced to the brick kilns.
p77
aVThis strange and awesome sight was like
p78
aVwalking into ancient Egypt or Dante's Inferno.
p79
aVEnveloped in temperatures of 130 degrees,
p80
aVmen, women, children, entire families in fact,
p81
aVwere cloaked in a heavy blanket of dust,
p82
aVwhile mechanically stacking bricks on their head,
p83
aVup to 18 at a time, and carrying them
p84
aVfrom the scorching kilns to trucks hundreds of yards away.
p85
aVDeadened by monotony and exhaustion,
p86
aVthey work silently, doing this task over and over
p87
aVfor 16 or 17 hours a day.
p88
aVThere were no breaks for food, no water breaks,
p89
aVand the severe dehydration made urinating
p90
aVpretty much inconsequential.
p91
aVSo pervasive was the heat and the dust
p92
aVthat my camera became too hot to even touch
p93
aVand ceased working.
p94
aVEvery 20 minutes, I'd have to run back to our cruiser
p95
aVto clean out my gear and run it under an air conditioner
p96
aVto revive it, and as I sat there,
p97
aVI thought, my camera is getting far better treatment
p98
aVthan these people.
p99
aa(lp100
VBack in the kilns, I wanted to cry,
p101
aVbut the abolitionist next to me quickly grabbed me
p102
aVand he said, "Lisa, don't do that. Just don't do that here."
p103
aVAnd he very clearly explained to me that emotional displays
p104
aVare very dangerous in a place like this,
p105
aVnot just for me, but for them.
p106
aVI couldn't offer them any direct help.
p107
aVI couldn't give them money, nothing.
p108
aVI wasn't a citizen of that country.
p109
aVI could get them in a worse situation
p110
aVthan they were already in.
p111
aVI'd have to rely on Free the Slaves to work
p112
aVwithin the system for their liberation,
p113
aVand I trusted that they would.
p114
aVAs for me, I'd have to wait until I got home
p115
aVto really feel my heartbreak.
p116
aa(lp117
VIn the Himalayas, I found children carrying stone
p118
aVfor miles down mountainous terrain
p119
aVto trucks waiting at roads below.
p120
aVThe big sheets of slate were heavier
p121
aVthan the children carrying them,
p122
aVand the kids hoisted them from their heads
p123
aVusing these handmade harnesses of sticks and rope
p124
aVand torn cloth.
p125
aVIt's difficult to witness something so overwhelming.
p126
aVHow can we affect something so insidious,
p127
aVyet so pervasive?
p128
aVSome don't even know they're enslaved,
p129
aVpeople working 16, 17 hours a day without any pay,
p130
aVbecause this has been the case all their lives.
p131
aVThey have nothing to compare it to.
p132
aVWhen these villagers claimed their freedom,
p133
aVthe slaveholders burned down all of their houses.
p134
aVI mean, these people had nothing,
p135
aVand they were so petrified, they wanted to give up,
p136
aVbut the woman in the center rallied for them to persevere,
p137
aVand abolitionists on the ground
p138
aVhelped them get a quarry lease of their own,
p139
aVso that now they do the same back-breaking work,
p140
aVbut they do it for themselves, and they get paid for it,
p141
aVand they do it in freedom.
p142
aa(lp143
VSex trafficking is what we often think of
p144
aVwhen we hear the word slavery,
p145
aVand because of this worldwide awareness,
p146
aVI was warned that it would be difficult for me to work safely
p147
aVwithin this particular industry.
p148
aa(lp149
VIn Kathmandu, I was escorted by women who had
p150
aVpreviously been sex slaves themselves.
p151
aVThey ushered me down a narrow set of stairs
p152
aVthat led to this dirty, dimly fluorescent lit basement.
p153
aVThis wasn't a brothel, per se.
p154
aVIt was more like a restaurant.
p155
aVCabin restaurants, as they're known in the trade,
p156
aVare venues for forced prostitution.
p157
aVEach has small, private rooms, where the slaves,
p158
aVwomen, along with young girls and boys,
p159
aVsome as young as seven years old,
p160
aVare forced to entertain the clients,
p161
aVencouraging them to buy more food and alcohol.
p162
aVEach cubicle is dark and dingy,
p163
aVidentified with a painted number on the wall,
p164
aVand partitioned by plywood and a curtain.
p165
aVThe workers here often endure tragic sexual abuse
p166
aVat the hands of their customers.
p167
aVStanding in the near darkness, I remember feeling
p168
aVthis quick, hot fear, and in that instant,
p169
aVI could only imagine what it must be like
p170
aVto be trapped in that hell.
p171
aVI had only one way out: the stairs from where I'd come in.
p172
aVThere were no back doors.
p173
aVThere were no windows large enough to climb through.
p174
aVThese people have no escape at all,
p175
aVand as we take in such a difficult subject,
p176
aVit's important to note that slavery, including sex trafficking,
p177
aVoccurs in our own backyard as well.
p178
aa(lp179
VTens of hundreds of people are enslaved in agriculture,
p180
aVin restaurants, in domestic servitude,
p181
aVand the list can go on.
p182
aVRecently, the New York Times reported that
p183
aVbetween 100,000 and 300,000 American children
p184
aVare sold into sex slavery every year.
p185
aVIt's all around us. We just don't see it.
p186
aa(lp187
VThe textile industry is another one we often think of
p188
aVwhen we hear about slave labor.
p189
aVI visited villages in India where entire families were enslaved
p190
aVin the silk trade.
p191
aVThis is a family portrait.
p192
aVThe dyed black hands are the father, while the blue
p193
aVand red hands are his sons.
p194
aVThey mix dye in these big barrels,
p195
aVand they submerge the silk into the liquid up to their elbows,
p196
aVbut the dye is toxic.
p197
aa(lp198
VMy interpreter told me their stories.
p199
aa(lp200
V"We have no freedom," they said.
p201
aV"We hope still, though, that we could leave this house
p202
aVsomeday and go someplace else
p203
aVwhere we actually get paid for our dyeing."
p204
aa(lp205
VIt's estimated that more than 4,000 children
p206
aVare enslaved on Lake Volta,
p207
aVthe largest man-made lake in the world.
p208
aVWhen we first arrived, I went to have a quick look.
p209
aVI saw what seemed to be a family fishing on a boat,
p210
aVtwo older brothers, some younger kids, makes sense right?
p211
aVWrong. They were all enslaved.
p212
aVChildren are taken from their families
p213
aVand trafficked and vanished,
p214
aVand they're forced to work endless hours on these boats
p215
aVon the lake, even though they do not know how to swim.
p216
aa(lp217
VThis young child is eight years old.
p218
aVHe was trembling when our boat approached,
p219
aVfrightened it would run over his tiny canoe.
p220
aVHe was petrified he would be knocked in the water.
p221
aVThe skeletal tree limbs submerged in Lake Volta
p222
aVoften catch the fishing nets, and weary,
p223
aVfrightened children are thrown into the water
p224
aVto untether the lines.
p225
aVMany of them drown.
p226
aa(lp227
VFor as long as he can recall, he's been forced to work
p228
aVon the lake.
p229
aVTerrified of his master, he will not run away,
p230
aVand since he's been treated with cruelty all his life,
p231
aVhe passes that down to the younger slaves
p232
aVthat he manages.
p233
aa(lp234
VI met these boys at five in the morning,
p235
aVwhen they were hauling in the last of their nets,
p236
aVbut they had been working since 1 a.m.
p237
aVin the cold, windy night.
p238
aVAnd it's important to note that these nets weigh
p239
aVmore than a thousand pounds when they're full of fish.
p240
aa(lp241
VI want to introduce you to Kofi.
p242
aVKofi was rescued from a fishing village.
p243
aVI met him at a shelter where Free the Slaves
p244
aVrehabilitates victims of slavery.
p245
aVHere he's seen taking a bath at the well,
p246
aVpouring big buckets of water over his head,
p247
aVand the wonderful news is,
p248
aVas you and I are sitting here talking today,
p249
aVKofi has been reunited with his family,
p250
aVand what's even better, his family has been given tools
p251
aVto make a living and to keep their children safe.
p252
aVKofi is the embodiment of possibility.
p253
aVWho will he become because someone took a stand
p254
aVand made a difference in his life?
p255
aa(lp256
VDriving down a road in Ghana
p257
aVwith partners of Free the Slaves,
p258
aVa fellow abolitionist on a moped suddenly sped up
p259
aVto our cruiser and tapped on the window.
p260
aVHe told us to follow him down a dirt road into the jungle.
p261
aVAt the end of the road, he urged us out of the car,
p262
aVand told the driver to quickly leave.
p263
aVThen he pointed toward this barely visible footpath,
p264
aVand said, "This is the path, this is the path. Go."
p265
aVAs we started down the path, we pushed aside the vines
p266
aVblocking the way, and after about an hour of walking in,
p267
aVfound that the trail had become flooded by recent rains,
p268
aVso I hoisted the photo gear above my head
p269
aVas we descended into these waters up to my chest.
p270
aVAfter another two hours of hiking, the winding trail
p271
aVabruptly ended at a clearing, and before us
p272
aVwas a mass of holes
p273
aVthat could fit into the size of a football field,
p274
aVand all of them were full of enslaved people laboring.
p275
aVMany women had children strapped to their backs
p276
aVwhile they were panning for gold,
p277
aVwading in water poisoned by mercury.
p278
aVMercury is used in the extraction process.
p279
aa(lp280
VThese miners are enslaved in a mine shaft
p281
aVin another part of Ghana.
p282
aVWhen they came out of the shaft, they were soaking wet
p283
aVfrom their own sweat.
p284
aVI remember looking into their tired, bloodshot eyes,
p285
aVfor many of them had been underground for 72 hours.
p286
aVThe shafts are up to 300 feet deep, and they carry out
p287
aVheavy bags of stone that later will be transported
p288
aVto another area, where the stone will be pounded
p289
aVso that they can extract the gold.
p290
aa(lp291
VAt first glance, the pounding site seems full
p292
aVof powerful men, but when we look closer,
p293
aVwe see some less fortunate working on the fringes,
p294
aVand children too.
p295
aVAll of them are victim to injury, illness and violence.
p296
aVIn fact, it's very likely that this muscular person
p297
aVwill end up like this one here, racked with tuberculosis
p298
aVand mercury poisoning in just a few years.
p299
aa(lp300
VThis is Manuru. When his father died,
p301
aVhis uncle trafficked him to work with him in the mines.
p302
aVWhen his uncle died, Manuru inherited his uncle's debt,
p303
aVwhich further forced him into being enslaved in the mines.
p304
aVWhen I met him, he had been working in the mines
p305
aVfor 14 years, and the leg injury that you see here
p306
aVis actually from a mining accident,
p307
aVone so severe doctors say his leg should be amputated.
p308
aVOn top of that, Manuru has tuberculosis,
p309
aVyet he's still forced to work day in and day out
p310
aVin that mine shaft.
p311
aa(lp312
VEven still, he has a dream that he will become free
p313
aVand become educated with the help of local activists
p314
aVlike Free the Slaves,
p315
aVand it's this sort of determination,
p316
aVin the face of unimaginable odds,
p317
aVthat fills me with complete awe.
p318
aa(lp319
VI want to shine a light on slavery.
p320
aVWhen I was working in the field,
p321
aVI brought lots of candles with me,
p322
aVand with the help of my interpreter,
p323
aVI imparted to the people I was photographing
p324
aVthat I wanted to illuminate their stories
p325
aVand their plight,
p326
aVso when it was safe for them, and safe for me,
p327
aVI made these images.
p328
aVThey knew their image would be seen
p329
aVby you out in the world.
p330
aVI wanted them to know that we will be bearing witness
p331
aVto them, and that we will do whatever we can
p332
aVto help make a difference in their lives.
p333
aVI truly believe, if we can see one another
p334
aVas fellow human beings, then it becomes very difficult
p335
aVto tolerate atrocities like slavery.
p336
aVThese images are not of issues. They are of people,
p337
aVreal people, like you and me, all deserving
p338
aVof the same rights, dignity and respect
p339
aVin their lives.
p340
aVThere is not a day that goes by that I don't think
p341
aVof these many beautiful, mistreated people
p342
aVI've had the tremendous honor of meeting.
p343
aa(lp344
VI hope that these images awaken a force
p345
aa(lp346
Vin those who view them, people like you,
p347
aVand I hope that force will ignite a fire,
p348
aVand that fire will shine a light on slavery,
p349
aVfor without that light, the beast of bondage
p350
aVcan continue to live in the shadows.
p351
aa(lp352
VThank you very much.
