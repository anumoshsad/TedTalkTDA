VLet's start with day and night.
p4
aVLife evolved under conditions
p5
aVof light and darkness,
p6
aVlight and then darkness.
p7
aVAnd so plants and animals
p8
aVdeveloped their own internal clocks
p9
aVso that they would be ready for these changes in light.
p10
aVThese are chemical clocks,
p11
aVand they're found in every known being that has two or more cells
p12
aVand in some that only have one cell.
p13
aa(lp14
VI'll give you an example \u2014
p15
aVif you take a horseshoe crab off the beach,
p16
aVand you fly it all the way across the continent,
p17
aVand you drop it into a sloped cage,
p18
aVit will scramble up the floor of the cage
p19
aVas the tide is rising
p20
aVon its home shores,
p21
aVand it'll skitter down again right as the water is receding
p22
aVthousands of miles away.
p23
aVIt'll do this for weeks,
p24
aVuntil it kind of gradually loses the plot.
p25
aVAnd it's incredible to watch,
p26
aVbut there's nothing psychic or paranormal going on;
p27
aVit's simply that these crabs have internal cycles
p28
aVthat correspond, usually, with what's going on around it.
p29
aa(lp30
VSo, we have this ability as well.
p31
aVAnd in humans, we call it the "body clock."
p32
aVYou can see this most clearly when you take away someone's watch
p33
aVand you shut them into a bunker, deep underground,
p34
aVfor a couple of months. (Laughter)
p35
aVPeople actually volunteer for this,
p36
aVand they usually come out
p37
aVkind of raving about their productive time in the hole.
p38
aVSo, no matter how atypical these subjects would have to be,
p39
aVthey all show the same thing.
p40
aVThey get up just a little bit later every day \u2014 say 15 minutes or so \u2014
p41
aVand they kind of drift all the way around the clock like this
p42
aVover the course of the weeks.
p43
aVAnd so, in this way we know that they are working on their own internal clocks,
p44
aVrather than somehow sensing the day outside.
p45
aa(lp46
VSo fine, we have a body clock,
p47
aVand it turns out that it's incredibly important in our lives.
p48
aVIt's a huge driver for culture
p49
aVand I think that it's the most underrated force on our behavior.
p50
aVWe evolved as a species near the equator,
p51
aVand so we're very well-equipped
p52
aVto deal with 12 hours of daylight
p53
aVand 12 hours of darkness.
p54
aVBut of course, we've spread to every corner of the globe
p55
aVand in Arctic Canada, where I live,
p56
aVwe have perpetual daylight in summer
p57
aVand 24 hours of darkness in winter.
p58
aVSo the culture, the northern aboriginal culture,
p59
aVtraditionally has been highly seasonal.
p60
aVIn winter, there's a lot of sleeping going on;
p61
aVyou enjoy your family life inside.
p62
aVAnd in summer, it's almost manic hunting
p63
aVand working activity very long hours,
p64
aVvery active.
p65
aa(lp66
VSo, what would our natural rhythm look like?
p67
aVWhat would our sleeping patterns be
p68
aVin the sort of ideal sense?
p69
aVWell, it turns out
p70
aVthat when people are living
p71
aVwithout any sort of artificial light at all,
p72
aVthey sleep twice every night.
p73
aVThey go to bed around 8:00 p.m.
p74
aVuntil midnight
p75
aVand then again, they sleep
p76
aVfrom about 2:00 a.m. until sunrise.
p77
aVAnd in-between, they have a couple of hours
p78
aVof sort of meditative quiet in bed.
p79
aVAnd during this time,
p80
aVthere's a surge of prolactin,
p81
aVthe likes of which a modern day never sees.
p82
aVThe people in these studies
p83
aVreport feeling so awake during the daytime,
p84
aVthat they realize
p85
aVthey're experiencing true wakefulness
p86
aVfor the first time in their lives.
p87
aa(lp88
VSo, cut to the modern day.
p89
aVWe're living in a culture of jet lag,
p90
aVglobal travel,
p91
aV24-hour business,
p92
aVshift work.
p93
aVAnd you know, our modern ways
p94
aVof doing things
p95
aVhave their advantages,
p96
aVbut I believe we should understand the costs.
p97
aa(lp98
VThank you.
