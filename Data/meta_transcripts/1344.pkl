VWhen I was seven years old and my sister was just five years old,
p4
aVwe were playing on top of a bunk bed.
p5
aVI was two years older than my sister at the time \u2014
p6
aVI mean, I'm two years older than her now \u2014
p7
aVbut at the time it meant she had to do everything that I wanted to do,
p8
aVand I wanted to play war.
p9
aVSo we were up on top of our bunk beds.
p10
aVAnd on one side of the bunk bed,
p11
aVI had put out all of my G.I. Joe soldiers and weaponry.
p12
aVAnd on the other side were all my sister's My Little Ponies
p13
aVready for a cavalry charge.
p14
aa(lp15
VThere are differing accounts of what actually happened that afternoon,
p16
aVbut since my sister is not here with us today,
p17
aVlet me tell you the true story \u2014
p18
aa(lp19
V(Laughter)
p20
aa(lp21
Vwhich is my sister's a little on the clumsy side.
p22
aVSomehow, without any help or push from her older brother at all,
p23
aVAmy disappeared off of the top of the bunk bed
p24
aVand landed with this crash on the floor.
p25
aVI nervously peered over the side of the bed
p26
aVto see what had befallen my fallen sister
p27
aVand saw that she had landed painfully on her hands and knees
p28
aVon all fours on the ground.
p29
aa(lp30
VI was nervous because my parents had charged me
p31
aVwith making sure that my sister and I
p32
aVplayed as safely and as quietly as possible.
p33
aVAnd seeing as how I had accidentally broken Amy's arm
p34
aVjust one week before \u2014
p35
aa(lp36
V(Laughter)
p37
aa(lp38
V(Laughter ends)
p39
aa(lp40
Vheroically pushing her out of the way of an oncoming imaginary sniper bullet,
p41
aa(lp42
V(Laughter)
p43
aVfor which I have yet to be thanked, I was trying as hard as I could \u2014
p44
aVshe didn't even see it coming \u2014
p45
aVI was trying hard to be on my best behavior.
p46
aa(lp47
VAnd I saw my sister's face,
p48
aVthis wail of pain and suffering and surprise
p49
aVthreatening to erupt from her mouth and wake my parents
p50
aVfrom the long winter's nap for which they had settled.
p51
aVSo I did the only thing
p52
aVmy frantic seven year-old brain could think to do to avert this tragedy.
p53
aVAnd if you have children, you've seen this hundreds of times.
p54
aVI said, "Amy, wait. Don't cry. Did you see how you landed?
p55
aVNo human lands on all fours like that.
p56
aVAmy, I think this means you're a unicorn."
p57
aa(lp58
V(Laughter)
p59
aa(lp60
VNow, that was cheating,
p61
aVbecause there was nothing she would want more
p62
aVthan not to be Amy the hurt five year-old little sister,
p63
aVbut Amy the special unicorn.
p64
aVOf course, this option was open to her brain
p65
aVat no point in the past.
p66
aVAnd you could see how my poor, manipulated sister faced conflict,
p67
aVas her little brain attempted to devote resources
p68
aVto feeling the pain and suffering and surprise she just experienced,
p69
aVor contemplating her new-found identity as a unicorn.
p70
aVAnd the latter won.
p71
aVInstead of crying or ceasing our play,
p72
aVinstead of waking my parents,
p73
aVwith all the negative consequences for me,
p74
aVa smile spread across her face
p75
aVand she scrambled back up onto the bunk bed
p76
aVwith all the grace of a baby unicorn \u2014
p77
aa(lp78
V(Laughter)
p79
aa(lp80
Vwith one broken leg.
p81
aa(lp82
VWhat we stumbled across
p83
aVat this tender age of just five and seven \u2014
p84
aVwe had no idea at the time \u2014
p85
aVwas was going be at the vanguard of a scientific revolution
p86
aVoccurring two decades later in the way that we look at the human brain.
p87
aVWe had stumbled across something called positive psychology,
p88
aVwhich is the reason I'm here today
p89
aVand the reason that I wake up every morning.
p90
aa(lp91
VWhen I started talking about this research
p92
aVoutside of academia, with companies and schools,
p93
aVthe first thing they said to never do is to start with a graph.
p94
aVThe first thing I want to do is start with a graph.
p95
aVThis graph looks boring,
p96
aVbut it is the reason I get excited and wake up every morning.
p97
aVAnd this graph doesn't even mean anything; it's fake data.
p98
aVWhat we found is \u2014
p99
aa(lp100
V(Laughter)
p101
aa(lp102
VIf I got this data studying you, I would be thrilled,
p103
aVbecause there's a trend there,
p104
aVand that means that I can get published,
p105
aVwhich is all that really matters.
p106
aVThere is one weird red dot above the curve,
p107
aVthere's one weirdo in the room \u2014
p108
aVI know who you are, I saw you earlier \u2014
p109
aVthat's no problem.
p110
aVThat's no problem, as most of you know, because I can just delete that dot.
p111
aVI can delete that dot because that's clearly a measurement error.
p112
aVAnd we know that's a measurement error because it's messing up my data.
p113
aa(lp114
V(Laughter)
p115
aa(lp116
VSo one of the first things we teach people
p117
aVin economics, statistics, business and psychology courses
p118
aVis how, in a statistically valid way, do we eliminate the weirdos.
p119
aVHow do we eliminate the outliers so we can find the line of best fit?
p120
aVWhich is fantastic if I'm trying to find out
p121
aVhow many Advil the average person should be taking \u2014 two.
p122
aa(lp123
VBut if I'm interested in your potential,
p124
aVor for happiness or productivity or energy or creativity,
p125
aVwe're creating the cult of the average with science.
p126
aVIf I asked a question like,
p127
aV"How fast can a child learn how to read in a classroom?"
p128
aVscientists change the answer to
p129
aV"How fast does the average child learn how to read in that classroom?"
p130
aVand we tailor the class towards the average.
p131
aVIf you fall below the average,
p132
aVthen psychologists get thrilled,
p133
aVbecause that means you're depressed or have a disorder,
p134
aVor hopefully both.
p135
aVWe're hoping for both because our business model is,
p136
aVif you come into a therapy session with one problem,
p137
aVwe want to make sure you leave knowing you have ten,
p138
aVso you keep coming back.
p139
aVWe'll go back into your childhood if necessary,
p140
aVbut eventually we want to make you normal again.
p141
aVBut normal is merely average.
p142
aa(lp143
VAnd positive psychology posits that if we study what is merely average,
p144
aVwe will remain merely average.
p145
aVThen instead of deleting those positive outliers,
p146
aVwhat I intentionally do is come into a population like this one
p147
aVand say, why?
p148
aVWhy are some of you high above the curve
p149
aVin terms of intellectual, athletic, musical ability,
p150
aVcreativity, energy levels,
p151
aVresiliency in the face of challenge, sense of humor?
p152
aVWhatever it is, instead of deleting you, what I want to do is study you.
p153
aVBecause maybe we can glean information,
p154
aVnot just how to move people up to the average,
p155
aVbut move the entire average up in our companies and schools worldwide.
p156
aa(lp157
VThe reason this graph is important to me
p158
aVis, on the news, the majority of the information is not positive.
p159
aVin fact it's negative.
p160
aVMost of it's about murder, corruption, diseases, natural disasters.
p161
aVAnd very quickly, my brain starts to think
p162
aVthat's the accurate ratio of negative to positive in the world.
p163
aVThis creates "the medical school syndrome."
p164
aVDuring the first year of medical training,
p165
aVas you read through a list of all the symptoms and diseases,
p166
aVsuddenly you realize you have all of them.
p167
aa(lp168
V(Laughter)
p169
aa(lp170
VI have a brother in-law named Bobo, which is a whole other story.
p171
aVBobo married Amy the unicorn.
p172
aVBobo called me on the phone \u2014
p173
aa(lp174
V(Laughter)
p175
aa(lp176
Vfrom Yale Medical School,
p177
aVand Bobo said, "Shawn, I have leprosy."
p178
aa(lp179
V(Laughter)
p180
aa(lp181
VWhich, even at Yale, is extraordinarily rare.
p182
aVBut I had no idea how to console poor Bobo
p183
aVbecause he had just gotten over an entire week of menopause.
p184
aa(lp185
V(Laughter)
p186
aa(lp187
VWe're finding it's not necessarily the reality that shapes us,
p188
aVbut the lens through which your brain views the world that shapes your reality.
p189
aVAnd if we can change the lens, not only can we change your happiness,
p190
aVwe can change every single educational and business outcome at the same time.
p191
aa(lp192
VI applied to Harvard on a dare.
p193
aVI didn't expect to get in, and my family had no money for college.
p194
aVWhen I got a military scholarship two weeks later, they let me go.
p195
aVSomething that wasn't even a possibility became a reality.
p196
aVI assumed everyone there would see it as a privilege as well,
p197
aVthat they'd be excited to be there.
p198
aVEven in a classroom full of people smarter than you,
p199
aVI felt you'd be happy just to be in that classroom.
p200
aVBut what I found is, while some people experience that,
p201
aVwhen I graduated after my four years
p202
aVand then spent the next eight years living in the dorms with the students \u2014
p203
aVHarvard asked me to; I wasn't that guy.
p204
aa(lp205
V(Laughter)
p206
aa(lp207
VI was an officer to counsel students through the difficult four years.
p208
aVAnd in my research and my teaching,
p209
aVI found that these students, no matter how happy they were
p210
aVwith their original success of getting into the school,
p211
aVtwo weeks later their brains were focused, not on the privilege of being there,
p212
aVnor on their philosophy or physics,
p213
aVbut on the competition, the workload,
p214
aVthe hassles, stresses, complaints.
p215
aa(lp216
VWhen I first went in there, I walked into the freshmen dining hall,
p217
aVwhich is where my friends from Waco, Texas, which is where I grew up \u2014
p218
aVI know some of you know this.
p219
aVWhen they'd visit, they'd look around,
p220
aVand say, "This dining hall looks like something out of Hogwart's."
p221
aVIt does, because that was Hogwart's and that's Harvard.
p222
aVAnd when they see this,
p223
aVthey say, "Why do you waste your time studying happiness at Harvard?
p224
aVWhat does a Harvard student possibly have to be unhappy about?"
p225
aa(lp226
VEmbedded within that question
p227
aVis the key to understanding the science of happiness.
p228
aVBecause what that question assumes
p229
aVis that our external world is predictive of our happiness levels,
p230
aVwhen in reality, if I know everything about your external world,
p231
aVI can only predict 10% of your long-term happiness.
p232
aV90 percent of your long-term happiness is predicted not by the external world,
p233
aVbut by the way your brain processes the world.
p234
aVAnd if we change it,
p235
aVif we change our formula for happiness and success,
p236
aVwe can change the way that we can then affect reality.
p237
aVWhat we found is that only 25% of job successes are predicted by IQ,
p238
aV75 percent of job successes
p239
aVare predicted by your optimism levels, your social support
p240
aVand your ability to see stress as a challenge instead of as a threat.
p241
aa(lp242
VI talked to a New England boarding school, probably the most prestigious one,
p243
aVand they said, "We already know that.
p244
aVSo every year, instead of just teaching our students, we have a wellness week.
p245
aVAnd we're so excited. Monday night we have the world's leading expert
p246
aVwill speak about adolescent depression.
p247
aVTuesday night it's school violence and bullying.
p248
aVWednesday night is eating disorders.
p249
aVThursday night is illicit drug use.
p250
aVAnd Friday night we're trying to decide between risky sex or happiness."
p251
aa(lp252
V(Laughter)
p253
aa(lp254
VI said, "That's most people's Friday nights."
p255
aa(lp256
V(Laughter)
p257
aa(lp258
V(Applause)
p259
aa(lp260
VWhich I'm glad you liked, but they did not like that at all.
p261
aVSilence on the phone.
p262
aVAnd into the silence, I said, "I'd be happy to speak at your school,
p263
aVbut that's not a wellness week, that's a sickness week.
p264
aVYou've outlined all the negative things that can happen,
p265
aVbut not talked about the positive."
p266
aa(lp267
VThe absence of disease is not health.
p268
aVHere's how we get to health:
p269
aVWe need to reverse the formula for happiness and success.
p270
aVIn the last three years, I've traveled to 45 countries,
p271
aVworking with schools and companies in the midst of an economic downturn.
p272
aVAnd I found that most companies and schools
p273
aVfollow a formula for success, which is this:
p274
aVIf I work harder, I'll be more successful.
p275
aVAnd if I'm more successful, then I'll be happier.
p276
aVThat undergirds most of our parenting and managing styles,
p277
aVthe way that we motivate our behavior.
p278
aa(lp279
VAnd the problem is it's scientifically broken and backwards for two reasons.
p280
aVEvery time your brain has a success,
p281
aVyou just changed the goalpost of what success looked like.
p282
aVYou got good grades, now you have to get better grades,
p283
aVyou got into a good school and after you get into a better one,
p284
aVyou got a good job, now you have to get a better job,
p285
aVyou hit your sales target, we're going to change it.
p286
aVAnd if happiness is on the opposite side of success, your brain never gets there.
p287
aVWe've pushed happiness over the cognitive horizon, as a society.
p288
aVAnd that's because we think we have to be successful,
p289
aVthen we'll be happier.
p290
aa(lp291
VBut our brains work in the opposite order.
p292
aVIf you can raise somebody's level of positivity in the present,
p293
aVthen their brain experiences what we now call a happiness advantage,
p294
aVwhich is your brain at positive performs significantly better
p295
aVthan at negative, neutral or stressed.
p296
aVYour intelligence rises, your creativity rises, your energy levels rise.
p297
aVIn fact, we've found that every single business outcome improves.
p298
aVYour brain at positive is 31% more productive
p299
aVthan your brain at negative, neutral or stressed.
p300
aVYou're 37% better at sales.
p301
aVDoctors are 19 percent faster, more accurate
p302
aVat coming up with the correct diagnosis
p303
aVwhen positive instead of negative, neutral or stressed.
p304
aa(lp305
VWhich means we can reverse the formula.
p306
aVIf we can find a way of becoming positive in the present,
p307
aVthen our brains work even more successfully
p308
aVas we're able to work harder, faster and more intelligently.
p309
aVWe need to be able to reverse this formula
p310
aVso we can start to see what our brains are actually capable of.
p311
aVBecause dopamine, which floods into your system when you're positive,
p312
aVhas two functions.
p313
aVNot only does it make you happier,
p314
aVit turns on all of the learning centers in your brain
p315
aVallowing you to adapt to the world in a different way.
p316
aa(lp317
VWe've found there are ways that you can train your brain
p318
aVto be able to become more positive.
p319
aVIn just a two-minute span of time done for 21 days in a row,
p320
aVwe can actually rewire your brain,
p321
aVallowing your brain to actually work more optimistically and more successfully.
p322
aVWe've done these things in research now
p323
aVin every company that I've worked with,
p324
aVgetting them to write down three new things that they're grateful for
p325
aVfor 21 days in a row, three new things each day.
p326
aVAnd at the end of that,
p327
aVtheir brain starts to retain a pattern
p328
aVof scanning the world not for the negative, but for the positive first.
p329
aa(lp330
VJournaling about one positive experience you've had over the past 24 hours
p331
aVallows your brain to relive it.
p332
aVExercise teaches your brain that your behavior matters.
p333
aVWe find that meditation allows your brain
p334
aVto get over the cultural ADHD that we've been creating
p335
aVby trying to do multiple tasks at once
p336
aVand allows our brains to focus on the task at hand.
p337
aVAnd finally, random acts of kindness are conscious acts of kindness.
p338
aVWe get people, when they open up their inbox,
p339
aVto write one positive email
p340
aVpraising or thanking somebody in their support network.
p341
aa(lp342
VAnd by doing these activities
p343
aVand by training your brain just like we train our bodies,
p344
aVwhat we've found is we can reverse the formula for happiness and success,
p345
aVand in doing so, not only create ripples of positivity,
p346
aVbut a real revolution.
p347
