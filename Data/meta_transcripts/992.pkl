VI'm going to talk to you
p4
aVabout power in this 21st century.
p5
aVAnd basically, what I'd like to tell you
p6
aVis that power is changing,
p7
aVand there are two types of changes
p8
aVI want to discuss.
p9
aVOne is power transition,
p10
aVwhich is change of power amongst states.
p11
aVAnd there the simple version of the message
p12
aVis it's moving from West to East.
p13
aVThe other is power diffusion,
p14
aVthe way power is moving
p15
aVfrom all states West or East
p16
aVto non-state actors.
p17
aVThose two things
p18
aVare the huge shifts of power
p19
aVin our century.
p20
aVAnd I want to tell you about them each separately
p21
aVand then how they interact
p22
aVand why, in the end, there may be some good news.
p23
aa(lp24
VWhen we talk about power transition,
p25
aVwe often talk about the rise of Asia.
p26
aVIt really should be called
p27
aVthe recovery or return of Asia.
p28
aVIf we looked at the world
p29
aVin 1800,
p30
aVyou'd find that more than half of the world's people
p31
aVlived in Asia
p32
aVand they made more than half the world's product.
p33
aVNow fast forward to 1900:
p34
aVhalf the world's people \u2014 more than half \u2014 still live in Asia,
p35
aVbut they're now making
p36
aVonly a fifth of the world's product.
p37
aVWhat happened? The Industrial Revolution,
p38
aVwhich meant that all of a sudden,
p39
aVEurope and America
p40
aVbecame the dominant center of the world.
p41
aVWhat we're going to see in the 21st century
p42
aVis Asia gradually returning
p43
aVto being more than half of the world's population
p44
aVand more than half of the world's product.
p45
aVThat's important and it's an important shift.
p46
aVBut let me tell you a little bit about
p47
aVthe other shift that I'm talking about,
p48
aVwhich is power diffusion.
p49
aa(lp50
VTo understand power diffusion
p51
aVput this in your mind:
p52
aVcomputing and communications costs
p53
aVhave fallen a thousandfold
p54
aVbetween 1970
p55
aVand the beginning of this century.
p56
aVNow that's a big abstract number.
p57
aVBut to make it more real,
p58
aVif the price of an automobile
p59
aVhad fallen as rapidly
p60
aVas the price of computing power,
p61
aVyou could buy a car today
p62
aVfor five dollars.
p63
aVNow when the price of any technology
p64
aVdeclines that dramatically,
p65
aVthe barriers to entry go down.
p66
aVAnybody can play in the game.
p67
aVSo in 1970,
p68
aVif you wanted to communicate
p69
aVfrom Oxford to Johannesburg
p70
aVto New Delhi
p71
aVto Brasilia
p72
aVand anywhere simultaneously,
p73
aVyou could do it.
p74
aVThe technology was there.
p75
aVBut to be able to do it,
p76
aVyou had to be very rich \u2014
p77
aVa government, a multinational corporation,
p78
aVmaybe the Catholic Church \u2014
p79
aVbut you had to be pretty wealthy.
p80
aVNow, anybody has that capacity,
p81
aVwhich previously was restricted by price
p82
aVjust to a few actors.
p83
aVIf they have the price of entry into an Internet cafe \u2014
p84
aVthe last time I looked, it was something like a pound an hour \u2014
p85
aVand if you have Skype, it's free.
p86
aVSo capabilities
p87
aVthat were once restricted
p88
aVare now available to everyone.
p89
aVAnd what that means
p90
aa(lp91
Vis not that the age of the State is over.
p92
aVThe State still matters.
p93
aVBut the stage is crowded.
p94
aVThe State's not alone. There are many, many actors.
p95
aVSome of that's good:
p96
aVOxfam,
p97
aVa great non-governmental actor.
p98
aVSome of it's bad:
p99
aVAl Qaeda, another non-governmental actor.
p100
aVBut think of what it does
p101
aVto how we think in traditional terms and concepts.
p102
aVWe think in terms of war
p103
aVand interstate war.
p104
aVAnd you can think back to 1941
p105
aVwhen the government of Japan
p106
aVattacked the United States at Pearl Harbor.
p107
aVIt's worth noticing
p108
aVthat a non-state actor
p109
aVattacking the United States in 2001
p110
aVkilled more Americans
p111
aVthan the government of Japan did in 1941.
p112
aVYou might think of that
p113
aVas the privatization of war.
p114
aVSo we're seeing a great change
p115
aVin terms of diffusion of power.
p116
aa(lp117
VNow the problem is
p118
aVthat we're not thinking about it in very innovative ways.
p119
aVSo let me step back
p120
aVand ask: what's power?
p121
aVPower is simple the ability
p122
aVto affect others
p123
aVto get the outcomes you want,
p124
aVand you can do it in three ways.
p125
aVYou can do it with threats
p126
aVof coercion, "sticks,"
p127
aVyou can do it with payments,
p128
aV"carrots,"
p129
aVor you can do it by getting others
p130
aVto want what you want.
p131
aVAnd that ability to get others to want what you want,
p132
aVto get the outcomes you want
p133
aVwithout coercion or payment,
p134
aVis what I call soft power.
p135
aVAnd that soft power has been much neglected
p136
aVand much misunderstood,
p137
aVand yet it's tremendously important.
p138
aVIndeed, if you can learn
p139
aVto use more soft power,
p140
aVyou can save a lot
p141
aVon carrots and sticks.
p142
aVTraditionally, the way people thought about power
p143
aVwas primarily in terms of military power.
p144
aVFor example, the great Oxford historian
p145
aVwho taught here at this university, A.J.P. Taylor,
p146
aVdefined a great power
p147
aVas a country able to prevail in war.
p148
aVBut we need a new narrative
p149
aVif we're to understand power in the 21st century.
p150
aVIt's not just prevailing at war,
p151
aVthough war still persists.
p152
aVIt's not whose army wins;
p153
aVit's also whose story wins.
p154
aVAnd we have to think much more in terms of narratives
p155
aVand whose narrative is going to be effective.
p156
aa(lp157
VNow let me go back
p158
aVto the question
p159
aVof power transition
p160
aVbetween states
p161
aVand what's happening there.
p162
aVthe narratives that we use now
p163
aVtend to be the rise and fall
p164
aVof the great powers.
p165
aVAnd the current narrative is all about
p166
aVthe rise of China
p167
aVand the decline of the United States.
p168
aVIndeed, with the 2008 financial crisis,
p169
aVmany people said this was
p170
aVthe beginning of the end of American power.
p171
aVThe tectonic plates
p172
aVof world politics were shifting.
p173
aVAnd president Medvedev of Russia, for example,
p174
aVpronounced in 2008
p175
aVthis was the beginning of the end
p176
aVof United States power.
p177
aVBut in fact,
p178
aVthis metaphor of decline
p179
aVis often very misleading.
p180
aVIf you look at history, in recent history,
p181
aVyou'll see the cycles of belief
p182
aVin American decline
p183
aVcome and go every 10 or 15 years or so.
p184
aVIn 1958,
p185
aVafter the Soviets put up Sputnik,
p186
aVit was "That's the end of America."
p187
aVIn 1973, with the oil embargo
p188
aVand the closing of the gold window,
p189
aVthat was the end of America.
p190
aVIn the 1980s,
p191
aVas America went through a transition in the Reagan period,
p192
aVbetween the rust belt economy of the midwest
p193
aVto the Silicon Valley economy of California,
p194
aVthat was the end of America.
p195
aVBut in fact, what we've seen
p196
aVis none of those were true.
p197
aVIndeed, people were over-enthusiastic
p198
aVin the early 2000s,
p199
aVthinking America could do anything,
p200
aVwhich led us into some disastrous
p201
aVforeign policy adventures,
p202
aVand now we're back to decline again.
p203
aa(lp204
VThe moral of this story
p205
aVis all these narratives about rise and fall and decline
p206
aVtell us a lot more about psychology
p207
aVthan they do about reality.
p208
aVIf we try to focus on the reality,
p209
aVthen what we need to focus on
p210
aVis what's really happening
p211
aVin terms of China and the United States.
p212
aVGoldman Sachs has projected
p213
aVthat China, the Chinese economy,
p214
aVwill surpass that of the U.S.
p215
aVby 2027.
p216
aVSo we've got, what,
p217
aV17 more years to go or so
p218
aVbefore China's bigger.
p219
aVNow someday,
p220
aVwith a billion point three people getting richer,
p221
aVthey are going to be bigger than the United States.
p222
aVBut be very careful about these projections
p223
aVsuch as the Goldman Sachs projection
p224
aVas though that gives you an accurate picture
p225
aVof power transition in this century.
p226
aVLet me mention three reasons why it's too simple.
p227
aVFirst of all, it's a linear projection.
p228
aVYou know, everything says,
p229
aVhere's the growth rate of China, here's the growth rate of the U.S.,
p230
aVhere it goes \u2014 straight line.
p231
aVHistory is not linear.
p232
aVThere are often bumps along the road, accidents along the way.
p233
aVThe second thing is
p234
aVthat the Chinese economy
p235
aVpasses the U.S. economy in, let's say, 2030,
p236
aVwhich it may it,
p237
aVthat will be a measure of total economic size,
p238
aVbut not of per capita income \u2014
p239
aVwon't tell you about the composition of the economy.
p240
aVChina still has large areas
p241
aVof underdevelopment
p242
aVand per capita income is a better measure
p243
aVof the sophistication of the economy.
p244
aVAnd that the Chinese won't catch up or pass the Americans
p245
aVuntil somewhere in the latter part,
p246
aVafter 2050, of this century.
p247
aa(lp248
VThe other point that's worth noticing
p249
aVis how one-dimensional
p250
aVthis projection is.
p251
aVYou know, it looks at economic power
p252
aVmeasured by GDP.
p253
aVDoesn't tell you much about military power,
p254
aVdoesn't tell you very much about soft power.
p255
aVIt's all very one-dimensional.
p256
aVAnd also, when we think about the rise of Asia,
p257
aVor return of Asia
p258
aVas I called it a little bit earlier,
p259
aVit's worth remembering Asia's not one thing.
p260
aVIf you're sitting in Japan,
p261
aVor in New Delhi,
p262
aVor in Hanoi,
p263
aVyour view of the rise of China
p264
aVis a little different than if you're sitting in Beijing.
p265
aVIndeed, one of the advantages
p266
aVthat the Americans will have
p267
aVin terms of power in Asia
p268
aVis all those countries
p269
aVwant an American insurance policy
p270
aVagainst the rise of China.
p271
aVIt's as though Mexico and Canada
p272
aVwere hostile neighbors to the United States,
p273
aVwhich they're not.
p274
aVSo these simple projections
p275
aVof the Goldman Sachs type
p276
aVare not telling us what we need to know
p277
aVabout power transition.
p278
aa(lp279
VBut you might ask, well so what in any case?
p280
aVWhy does it matter? Who cares?
p281
aVIs this just a game
p282
aVthat diplomats and academics play?
p283
aVThe answer is it matters quite a lot.
p284
aVBecause, if you believe in decline
p285
aVand you get the answers wrong on this,
p286
aVthe facts, not the myths,
p287
aVyou may have policies which are very dangerous.
p288
aVLet me give you an example from history.
p289
aVThe Peloponnesian War
p290
aVwas the great conflict
p291
aVin which the Greek city state system
p292
aVtore itself apart
p293
aVtwo and a half millennia ago.
p294
aVWhat caused it?
p295
aVThucydides, the great historian of the the Peloponnesian War,
p296
aVsaid it was the rise in the power of Athens
p297
aVand the fear it created in Sparta.
p298
aVNotice both halves of that explanation.
p299
aa(lp300
VMany people argue
p301
aVthat the 21st century
p302
aVis going to repeat the 20th century,
p303
aVin which World War One,
p304
aVthe great conflagration
p305
aVin which the European state system
p306
aVtore itself apart
p307
aVand destroyed its centrality in the world,
p308
aVthat that was caused by
p309
aVthe rise in the power of Germany
p310
aVand the fear it created in Britain.
p311
aVSo there are people who are telling us
p312
aVthis is going to be reproduced today,
p313
aVthat what we're going to see
p314
aVis the same thing now in this century.
p315
aVNo, I think that's wrong.
p316
aVIt's bad history.
p317
aVFor one thing, Germany had surpassed Britain
p318
aVin industrial strength by 1900.
p319
aVAnd as I said earlier,
p320
aVChina has not passed the United States.
p321
aVBut also, if you have this belief
p322
aVand it creates a sense of fear,
p323
aVit leads to overreaction.
p324
aVAnd the greatest danger we have
p325
aVof managing this power transition
p326
aVof the shift toward the East is fear.
p327
aVTo paraphrase Franklin Roosevelt
p328
aVfrom a different context,
p329
aVthe greatest thing we have to fear is fear itself.
p330
aVWe don't have to fear the rise of China
p331
aVor the return of Asia.
p332
aVAnd if we have policies
p333
aVin which we take it
p334
aVin that larger historical perspective,
p335
aVwe're going to be able
p336
aVto manage this process.
p337
aa(lp338
VLet me say a word now
p339
aVabout the distribution of power
p340
aVand how it relates to power diffusion
p341
aVand then pull these two types together.
p342
aVIf you ask how is power distributed in the world today,
p343
aVit's distributed much like
p344
aVa three-dimensional chess game.
p345
aVTop board:
p346
aVmilitary power among states.
p347
aVThe United States is the only superpower,
p348
aVand it's likely to remain that way
p349
aVfor two or three decades.
p350
aVChina's not going to replace the U.S. on this military board.
p351
aVMiddle board of this three-dimensional chess game:
p352
aVeconomic power among states.
p353
aVPower is multi-polar.
p354
aVThere are balancers \u2014
p355
aVthe U.S., Europe,
p356
aVChina, Japan
p357
aVcan balance each other.
p358
aVThe bottom board of this three-dimensional,
p359
aVthe board of transnational relations,
p360
aVthings that cross borders outside the control of governments,
p361
aVthings like climate change, drug trade,
p362
aVfinancial flows,
p363
aVpandemics,
p364
aVall these things that cross borders
p365
aVoutside the control of governments,
p366
aVthere nobody's in charge.
p367
aVIt makes no sense to call this unipolar
p368
aVor multi-polar.
p369
aVPower is chaotically distributed.
p370
aVAnd the only way you can solve these problems \u2014
p371
aVand this is where many greatest challenges
p372
aVare coming in this century \u2014
p373
aVis through cooperation,
p374
aVthrough working together,
p375
aVwhich means that soft power becomes more important,
p376
aVthat ability to organize networks
p377
aVto deal with these kinds of problems
p378
aVand to be able to get cooperation.
p379
aa(lp380
VAnother way of putting it
p381
aVis that as we think of power in the 21st century,
p382
aVwe want to get away from the idea
p383
aVthat power's always zero sum \u2014
p384
aVmy gain is your loss and vice versa.
p385
aVPower can also be positive sum,
p386
aVwhere your gain can be my gain.
p387
aVIf China develops greater energy security
p388
aVand greater capacity
p389
aVto deal with its problems of carbon emissions,
p390
aVthat's good for us
p391
aVas well as good for China
p392
aVas well as good for everybody else.
p393
aVSo empowering China
p394
aVto deal with its own problems of carbon
p395
aVis good for everybody,
p396
aVand it's not a zero sum, I win, you lose.
p397
aVIt's one in which we can all gain.
p398
aVSo as we think about power
p399
aVin this century,
p400
aVwe want to get away from this view
p401
aVthat it's all I win, you lose.
p402
aVNow I don't mean to be Pollyannaish about this.
p403
aVWars persist. Power persists.
p404
aVMilitary power is important.
p405
aVKeeping balances is important.
p406
aVAll this still persists.
p407
aVHard power is there,
p408
aVand it will remain.
p409
aVBut unless you learn how to mix
p410
aVhard power with soft power
p411
aVinto strategies that I call smart power,
p412
aVyou're not going to deal with the new kinds of problems
p413
aVthat we're facing.
p414
aa(lp415
VSo the key question that we need to think about as we look at this
p416
aVis how do we work together
p417
aVto produce global public goods,
p418
aVthings from which all of us can benefit?
p419
aVHow do we define our national interests
p420
aVso that it's not just zero sum,
p421
aVbut positive sum.
p422
aVIn that sense, if we define our interests,
p423
aVfor example, for the United States
p424
aVthe way Britain defined its interests in the 19th century,
p425
aVkeeping an open trading system,
p426
aVkeeping a monetary stability, keeping freedom of the seas \u2014
p427
aVthose were good for Britain,
p428
aVthey were good for others as well.
p429
aVAnd in the 21st century, you have to do an analog to that.
p430
aVHow do we produce global public goods,
p431
aVwhich are good for us,
p432
aVbut good for everyone at the same time?
p433
aVAnd that's going to be the good news dimension
p434
aVof what we need to think about
p435
aVas we think of power in the 21st century.
p436
aa(lp437
VThere are ways to define our interests
p438
aVin which, while protecting ourselves with hard power,
p439
aVwe can organize with others in networks
p440
aVto produce, not only public goods,
p441
aVbut ways that will enhance our soft power.
p442
aVSo if one looks at the statements
p443
aVthat have been made about this,
p444
aVI am impressed that when Hillary Clinton
p445
aVdescribed the foreign policy
p446
aVof the Obama administration,
p447
aVshe said that the foreign policy of the Obama administration
p448
aVwas going to be smart power,
p449
aVas she put it, "using all the tools
p450
aVin our foreign policy tool box."
p451
aVAnd if we're going to deal
p452
aVwith these two great power shifts that I've described,
p453
aVthe power shift represented by transition among states,
p454
aVthe power shift represented
p455
aVby diffusion of power away from all states,
p456
aVwe're going to have to develop a new narrative of power
p457
aVin which we combine hard and soft power
p458
aVinto strategies of smart power.
p459
aVAnd that's the good news I have. We can do that.
p460
