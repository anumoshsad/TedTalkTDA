VWhat I want to talk about today is one idea.
p4
aVIt's an idea for a new kind of school,
p5
aVwhich turns on its head much of our conventional thinking
p6
aVabout what schools are for and how they work.
p7
aVAnd it might just be coming to a neighborhood near you soon.
p8
aVWhere it comes from
p9
aVis an organization called the Young Foundation,
p10
aVwhich, over many decades,
p11
aVhas come up with many innovations in education, like the Open University
p12
aVand things like Extended Schools,
p13
aVSchools for Social Entrepreneurs, Summer Universities
p14
aVand the School of Everything.
p15
aa(lp16
VAnd about five years ago, we asked
p17
aVwhat was the most important need for innovation
p18
aVin schooling here in the U.K.
p19
aVAnd we felt the most important priority
p20
aVwas to bring together two sets of problems.
p21
aVOne was large numbers of bored teenagers
p22
aVwho just didn't like school,
p23
aVcouldn't see any relationship between what they learned in school
p24
aVand future jobs.
p25
aVAnd employers who kept complaining
p26
aVthat the kids coming out of school weren't actually ready for real work,
p27
aVdidn't have the right attitudes and experience.
p28
aa(lp29
VAnd so we try to ask:
p30
aVWhat kind of school would have the teenagers fighting to get in,
p31
aVnot fighting to stay out?
p32
aVAnd after hundreds of conversations
p33
aVwith teenagers and teachers and parents
p34
aVand employers and schools
p35
aVfrom Paraguay to Australia,
p36
aVand looking at some of the academic research,
p37
aVwhich showed the importance
p38
aVof what's now called non-cognitive skills \u2014
p39
aVthe skills of motivation, resilience \u2014
p40
aVand that these are as important
p41
aVas the cognitive skills \u2014 formal academic skills \u2014
p42
aVwe came up with an answer, a very simple answer in a way,
p43
aVwhich we called the Studio School.
p44
aVAnd we called it a studio school
p45
aVto go back to the original idea of a studio in the Renaissance
p46
aVwhere work and learning are integrated.
p47
aVYou work by learning,
p48
aVand you learn by working.
p49
aVAnd the design we came up with had the following characteristics.
p50
aa(lp51
VFirst of all, we wanted small schools \u2014
p52
aVabout 300, 400 pupils \u2014
p53
aV14 to 19 year-olds,
p54
aVand critically, about 80 percent of the curriculum done
p55
aVnot through sitting in classrooms,
p56
aVbut through real-life, practical projects,
p57
aVworking on commission
p58
aVto businesses, NGO's and others.
p59
aVThat every pupil would have a coach, as well as teachers,
p60
aVwho would have timetables
p61
aVmuch more like a work environment in a business.
p62
aVAnd all of this will be done within the public system,
p63
aVfunded by public money,
p64
aVbut independently run.
p65
aVAnd all at no extra cost, no selection,
p66
aVand allowing the pupils the route into university,
p67
aVeven if many of them would want to become entrepreneurs
p68
aVand have manual jobs as well.
p69
aVUnderlying it was some very simple ideas
p70
aVthat large numbers of teenagers learn best by doing things,
p71
aVthey learn best in teams
p72
aVand they learn best by doing things for real \u2014
p73
aVall the opposite of what mainstream schooling
p74
aVactually does.
p75
aa(lp76
VNow that was a nice idea,
p77
aVso we moved into the rapid prototyping phase.
p78
aVWe tried it out,
p79
aVfirst in Luton \u2014
p80
aVfamous for its airport and not much else, I fear \u2014
p81
aVand in Blackpool \u2014 famous for its beaches and leisure.
p82
aVAnd what we found \u2014 and we got quite a lot of things wrong
p83
aVand then improved them \u2014
p84
aVbut we found that the young people loved it.
p85
aVThey found it much more motivational, much more exciting
p86
aVthan traditional education.
p87
aVAnd perhaps most important of all,
p88
aVtwo years later when the exam results came through,
p89
aVthe pupils who had been put on these field trials
p90
aVwho were in the lowest performing groups
p91
aVhad jumped right to the top \u2014
p92
aVin fact, pretty much at the top decile of performance
p93
aVin terms of GCSE's,
p94
aVwhich is the British marking system.
p95
aa(lp96
VNow not surprisingly,
p97
aVthat influenced some people to think we were onto something.
p98
aVThe minister of education
p99
aVdown south in London
p100
aVdescribed himself as a "big fan."
p101
aVAnd the business organizations thought we were onto something
p102
aVin terms of a way of preparing children much better
p103
aVfor real-life work today.
p104
aVAnd indeed, the head of the Chambers of Commerce
p105
aVis now the chairman of the Studio Schools Trust
p106
aVand helping it, not just with big businesses,
p107
aVbut small businesses all over the country.
p108
aa(lp109
VWe started with two schools.
p110
aVThat's grown this year to about 10.
p111
aVAnd next year, we're expecting about 35 schools
p112
aVopen across England,
p113
aVand another 40 areas
p114
aVwant to have their own schools opening \u2014
p115
aVa pretty rapid spread
p116
aVof this idea.
p117
aVInterestingly,
p118
aVit's happened almost entirely without media coverage.
p119
aVIt's happened almost entirely without big money behind it.
p120
aVIt spread almost entirely through word of mouth, virally,
p121
aVacross teachers, parents,
p122
aVpeople involved in education.
p123
aVAnd it spread because of the power of an idea \u2014
p124
aVso the very, very simple idea
p125
aVabout turning education on its head
p126
aVand putting the things which were marginal,
p127
aVthings like working in teams, doing practical projects,
p128
aVand putting them right at the heart of learning,
p129
aVrather than on the edges.
p130
aa(lp131
VNow there's a whole set of new schools
p132
aVopening up this autumn.
p133
aVThis is one from Yorkshire
p134
aVwhere, in fact, my nephew, I hope, will be able to attend it.
p135
aVAnd this one is focused
p136
aVon creative and media industries.
p137
aVOther ones have a focus on health care,
p138
aVtourism, engineering
p139
aVand other fields.
p140
aa(lp141
VWe think we're onto something.
p142
aVIt's not perfect yet,
p143
aVbut we think this is one idea
p144
aVwhich can transform the lives
p145
aVof thousands, possibly millions, of teenagers
p146
aVwho are really bored by schooling.
p147
aVIt doesn't animate them.
p148
aVThey're not like all of you who can sit in rows
p149
aVand hear things said to you for hour after hour.
p150
aVThey want to do things, they want to get their hands dirty,
p151
aVthey want education to be for real.
p152
aVAnd my hope is that some of you out there
p153
aVmay be able to help us.
p154
aa(lp155
VWe feel we're on the beginning of a journey
p156
aVof experiment and improvement
p157
aVto turn the Studio School idea
p158
aVinto something which is present,
p159
aVnot as a universal answer for every child,
p160
aVbut at least as an answer for some children in every part of the world.
p161
aVAnd I hope that a few of you at least can help us make that happen.
p162
aa(lp163
VThank you very much.
