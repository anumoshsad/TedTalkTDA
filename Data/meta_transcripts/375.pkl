VYou might be wondering why I'm wearing sunglasses,
p4
aVand one answer to that is, because I'm here to talk about glamour.
p5
aVSo, we all think we know what glamour is. Here it is.
p6
aVIt's glamorous movie stars, like Marlene Dietrich.
p7
aVAnd it comes in a male form, too \u2014
p8
aVvery glamorous.
p9
aVNot only can he shoot, drive, drink \u2014 you know, he drinks wine,
p10
aVthere actually is a little wine in there \u2014
p11
aVand of course, always wears a tuxedo.
p12
aVBut I think that glamour actually has a much broader meaning \u2014
p13
aVone that is true for the movie stars and the fictional characters,
p14
aVbut also comes in other forms.
p15
aa(lp16
VA magazine?
p17
aVWell, it's certainly not this one.
p18
aVThis is the least glamorous magazine on the newsstand \u2014 it's all about sex tips.
p19
aVSex tips are not glamorous.
p20
aVAnd Drew Barrymore, for all her wonderful charm,
p21
aVis not glamorous either.
p22
aVBut there is a glamour of industry.
p23
aVThis is Margaret Bourke-White's \u2014
p24
aVone of her pictures she did.
p25
aVFantastic, glamorous pictures
p26
aVof steel mills and paper mills and all kinds of glamorous industrial places.
p27
aVAnd there's the mythic glamour
p28
aVof the garage entrepreneur.
p29
aVThis is the Hewlett-Packard garage.
p30
aVWe know everyone who starts a business in a garage
p31
aVends up founding Hewlett-Packard.
p32
aVThere's the glamour of physics.
p33
aVWhat could be more glamorous than understanding the entire universe,
p34
aVgrand unification? And, by the way, it helps if you're Brian Greene \u2014
p35
aVhe has other kinds of glamour.
p36
aa(lp37
VAnd there is, of course, this glamour.
p38
aVThis is very, very glamorous: the glamour of outer space \u2014
p39
aVand not the alien-style glamour,
p40
aVbut the nice, clean, early '60s version.
p41
aVSo what do we mean by glamour?
p42
aVWell, one thing you can do if you want to know what glamour means
p43
aVis you can look in the dictionary.
p44
aVAnd it actually helps a lot more if you look in a very old dictionary,
p45
aVin this case the 1913 dictionary.
p46
aVBecause for centuries, glamour had a very particular meaning,
p47
aVand the word was actually used differently from the way we think of it.
p48
aVYou had "a" glamour.
p49
aVIt wasn't glamour as a quality \u2014 you "cast a glamour."
p50
aVGlamour was a literal magic spell.
p51
aVNot a metaphorical one, the way we use it today,
p52
aVbut a literal magic spell associated with witches and gypsies
p53
aVand to some extent, Celtic magic.
p54
aVAnd over the years, around the turn of the 20th century,
p55
aVit started to take on this other kind of deception \u2014
p56
aVthis definition for any artificial interest in, or association with,
p57
aVan object through which it appears delusively magnified or glorified.
p58
aVBut still, glamour is an illusion.
p59
aVGlamour is a magic spell.
p60
aVAnd there's something dangerous about glamour
p61
aVthroughout most of history. When the witches cast a magic spell
p62
aVon you, it was not in your self-interest \u2014
p63
aVit was to get you to act against your interest.
p64
aa(lp65
VWell of course, in the 20th century,
p66
aVglamour came to have this different meaning associated with Hollywood.
p67
aVAnd this is Hedy Lamarr.
p68
aVHedy Lamarr said, "Anyone can look glamorous,
p69
aVall you have to do is sit there and look stupid." (Laughter)
p70
aVBut in fact, with all due respect to Hedy \u2014
p71
aVabout whom we'll hear more later \u2014 there's a lot more to it.
p72
aVThere was a tremendous amount of technical achievement
p73
aVassociated with creating this Hollywood glamour.
p74
aVThere were scores of retouchers and lighting experts and make-up experts.
p75
aVYou can go to the museum of Hollywood history in Hollywood
p76
aVand see Max Factor's special rooms that he painted different colors
p77
aVdepending on the complexion of the star he was going to make up.
p78
aVSo you've got this highly stylized portrait of something
p79
aVthat was not entirely of this earth \u2014 it was a portrait of a star.
p80
aVAnd actually, we see glamorized photos of stars all the time \u2014
p81
aVthey call them false color.
p82
aa(lp83
VGlamour is a form of falsification,
p84
aVbut falsification to achieve a particular purpose.
p85
aVIt may be to illuminate the star; it may be to sell a film.
p86
aVAnd it involves a great deal of technique.
p87
aVIt's not \u2014 glamour is not something \u2014
p88
aVyou don't wake up in the morning glamorous. I don't care who you are.
p89
aVEven Nicole Kidman doesn't wake up in the morning glamorous.
p90
aVThere is a process of "idealization, glorification and dramatization,"
p91
aVand it's not just the case for people.
p92
aVGlamour doesn't have to be people.
p93
aVArchitectural photography \u2014
p94
aVJulius Schulman, who has talked about transfiguration,
p95
aVtook this fabulous, famous picture of the Kauffman House.
p96
aVArchitectural photography is extremely glamorous.
p97
aVIt puts you into this special, special world.
p98
aVThis is Alex Ross's comic book art,
p99
aVwhich appears to be extremely realistic,
p100
aVas part of his style is he gives you a kind of realism in his comic art.
p101
aVExcept that light doesn't work this way in the real world.
p102
aa(lp103
VWhen you stack people in rows,
p104
aVthe ones in the background look smaller than the ones in the foreground \u2014
p105
aVbut not in the world of glamour.
p106
aVWhat glamour is all about \u2014 I took this from a blurb
p107
aVin the table of contents of New York magazine,
p108
aVwhich was telling us that glamour is back \u2014
p109
aVglamour is all about transcending the everyday.
p110
aVAnd I think that that's starting to get at what the core
p111
aVthat combines all sorts of glamour is.
p112
aVThis is Filippino Lippi's 1543 portrait of Saint Apollonia.
p113
aVAnd I don't know who she is either,
p114
aVbut this is the [16th] century equivalent of a supermodel.
p115
aVIt's a very glamorous portrait.
p116
aVWhy is it glamorous?
p117
aVIt's glamorous, first, because she is beautiful \u2014
p118
aVbut that does not make you glamorous,
p119
aVthat only makes you beautiful.
p120
aVShe is graceful, she is mysterious and she is transcendent,
p121
aVand those are the central qualities of glamour.
p122
aVYou don't see her eyes; they're looking downward.
p123
aVShe's not looking away from you exactly,
p124
aVbut you have to mentally imagine her world.
p125
aVShe's encouraging you to contemplate this higher world
p126
aVto which she belongs, where she can be completely tranquil
p127
aVwhile holding the iron instruments of her death by torture.
p128
aVMel Gibson's "Passion Of The Christ" \u2014 not glamorous.
p129
aVThat's glamour:
p130
aVthat's Michelangelo's "Pieta," where Mary is the same age as Jesus
p131
aVand they're both awfully happy and pleasant.
p132
aa(lp133
VGlamour invites us to live in a different world.
p134
aVIt has to simultaneously be mysterious, a little bit distant \u2014
p135
aVthat's why, often in these glamour shots,
p136
aVthe person is not looking at the audience,
p137
aVit's why sunglasses are glamorous \u2014
p138
aVbut also not so far above us that we can't identify with the person.
p139
aVIn some sense, there has to be something like us.
p140
aVSo as I say, in religious art, you know, God is not glamorous.
p141
aVGod cannot be glamorous because God is omnipotent,
p142
aVomniscient \u2014 too far above us.
p143
aVAnd yet you will see in religious art, saints or the Virgin Mary
p144
aVwill often be portrayed \u2014 not always \u2014 in glamorous forms.
p145
aVAs I said earlier, glamour does not have to be about people,
p146
aVbut it has to have this transcendent quality.
p147
aVWhat is it about Superman?
p148
aVAside from Alex Ross's style, which is very glamorous,
p149
aVone thing about Superman is he makes you believe that a man can fly.
p150
aa(lp151
VGlamour is all about transcending this world
p152
aVand getting to an idealized, perfect place.
p153
aVAnd this is one reason that modes of transportation
p154
aVtend to be extremely glamorous.
p155
aVThe less experience we have with them,
p156
aVthe more glamorous they are.
p157
aVSo you can do a glamorized picture of a car,
p158
aVbut you can't do a glamorized picture of traffic.
p159
aVYou can do a glamorized picture of an airplane, but not the inside.
p160
aVThe notion is that it's going to transport you,
p161
aVand the story is not about, you know, the guy in front of you in the airplane,
p162
aVwho has this nasty little kid, or the big cough.
p163
aVThe story is about where you're arriving,
p164
aVor thinking about where you're arriving.
p165
aVAnd this sense of being transported
p166
aVis one reason that we have glamour styling.
p167
aVThis sort of streamlining styling is not just glamorous
p168
aVbecause we associate it with movies of that period, but because,
p169
aVin it's streamlining, it transports us from the everyday.
p170
aa(lp171
VThe same thing \u2014 arches are very glamorous.
p172
aVArches with stained glass \u2014 even more glamorous.
p173
aVStaircases that curve away from you are glamorous.
p174
aVI happen to find that particular staircase picture very glamorous
p175
aVbecause, to me, it captures the whole promise
p176
aVof the academic contemplative life \u2014
p177
aVbut maybe that's because I went to Princeton.
p178
aVAnyway, skylines are super glamorous,
p179
aVcity streets \u2014 not so glamorous.
p180
aVYou know, when you get, actually to this town it has reality.
p181
aVThe horizon, the open road, is very, very glamorous.
p182
aVThere are few things more glamorous than the horizon \u2014
p183
aVexcept, possibly, multiple horizons.
p184
aVOf course, here you don't feel the cold, or the heat \u2014
p185
aVyou just see the possibilities.
p186
aVIn order to pull glamour off, you need this Renaissance quality
p187
aVof sprezzatura, which is a term coined by Castiglione
p188
aVin his book, "The Book Of The Courtier."
p189
aVThere's the not-glamorous version of what it looks like today,
p190
aVafter a few centuries.
p191
aa(lp192
VAnd sprezzatura is the art that conceals art.
p193
aVIt makes things look effortless.
p194
aVYou don't think about how Nicole Kidman is maneuvering that dress \u2014
p195
aVshe just looks completely natural.
p196
aVAnd I remember reading, after the Lara Croft movies,
p197
aVhow Angelina Jolie would go home completely black and blue.
p198
aVOf course, they covered that with make-up,
p199
aVbecause Lara Croft did all those same stunts \u2014
p200
aVbut she doesn't get black and blue, because she has sprezzatura.
p201
aV"To conceal all art and make whatever is done or said appear to be without effort":
p202
aVAnd this is one of the critical aspects of glamour.
p203
aVGlamour is about editing.
p204
aVHow do you create the sense of transcendence,
p205
aVthe sense of evoking a perfect world?
p206
aVThe sense of, you know, life could be better, I could join this \u2014
p207
aVI could be a perfect person, I could join this perfect world.
p208
aVWe don't tell you all the grubby details.
p209
aa(lp210
VNow, this was kindly lent to me by Jeff Bezos, from last year.
p211
aVThis is underneath Jeff's desk.
p212
aVThis is what the real world of computers,
p213
aVlamps, electrical appliances of all kinds, looks like.
p214
aVBut if you look in a catalog \u2014
p215
aVparticularly a catalog of modern, beautiful objects for your home \u2014
p216
aVit looks like this.
p217
aVThere are no cords.
p218
aVLook next time you get these catalogs in your mail \u2014
p219
aVyou can usually figure out where they hid the cord.
p220
aVBut there's always this illusion that if you buy this lamp,
p221
aVyou will live in a world without cords. (Laughter)
p222
aVAnd the same thing is true of, if you buy this laptop
p223
aVor you buy this computer \u2014 and even in these wireless eras,
p224
aVyou don't get to live in the world without cords.
p225
aVYou have to have mystery and you have to have grace.
p226
aVAnd there she is \u2014 Grace.
p227
aVThis is the most glamorous picture, I think, ever.
p228
aVPart of the thing is that, in "Rear Window,"
p229
aVthe question is, is she too glamorous to live in his world?
p230
aVAnd the answer is no, but of course it's really just a movie.
p231
aa(lp232
VHere's Hedy Lamarr again.
p233
aVAnd, you know, this kind of head covering is extremely glamorous
p234
aVbecause, like sunglasses, it conceals and reveals at the same time.
p235
aVTranslucence is glamorous \u2014
p236
aVthat's why all these people wear pearls.
p237
aVIt's why barware is glamorous. Glamour is translucent \u2014
p238
aVnot transparent, not opaque.
p239
aVIt invites us into the world
p240
aVbut it doesn't give us a completely clear picture.
p241
aVAnd I think if Grace Kelly is the most glamorous person,
p242
aVmaybe a spiral staircase with glass block may be the most glamorous interior shot,
p243
aVbecause a spiral staircase is incredibly glamorous.
p244
aVIt has that sense of going up and away,
p245
aVand yet you never think about how you would really trip
p246
aVif you were \u2014 particularly going down.
p247
aVAnd of course glass block has that sense of translucence.
p248
aVSo, this session's supposed to be about pure pleasure
p249
aVbut glamour's really partly about meaning.
p250
aVAll individuals and all cultures have ideals
p251
aVthat cannot possibly be realized in reality.
p252
aa(lp253
VThey have contradictions,
p254
aVthey uphold principles that are incommensurable with each other \u2014
p255
aVwhatever it is \u2014 and yet these ideals give meaning and purpose
p256
aVto our lives as cultures and as individuals.
p257
aVAnd the way we deal with that is we displace them \u2014
p258
aVwe put them into a golden world, an imagined world,
p259
aVan age of heroes, the world to come.
p260
aVAnd in the life of an individual, we often associate that with some object.
p261
aVThe white picket fence, the perfect house.
p262
aVThe perfect kitchen \u2014 no bills on the counter in the perfect kitchen.
p263
aVYou know, you buy that Viking range, this is what your kitchen will look like.
p264
aVThe perfect love life \u2014 symbolized by the perfect necklace,
p265
aVthe perfect diamond ring.
p266
aVThe perfect getaway in your perfect car.
p267
aVThis is an interior design firm that is literally called Utopia.
p268
aVThe perfect office \u2014
p269
aVagain, no cords, as far as I can tell.
p270
aVAnd certainly, no, it doesn't look a thing like my office.
p271
aVI mean, there's no paper on the desk.
p272
aVWe want this golden world.
p273
aVAnd some people get rich enough,
p274
aVand if they have their ideals \u2014 in a sort of domestic sense,
p275
aVthey get to acquire their perfect world.
p276
aa(lp277
VDean Koontz built this fabulous home theater, which is \u2014
p278
aVI don't think accidentally \u2014 in Art Deco style.
p279
aVThat symbolizes this sense of being safe and at home.
p280
aVThis is not always good, because what is your perfect world?
p281
aVWhat is your ideal, and also, what has been edited out?
p282
aVIs it something important?
p283
aV"The Matrix" is a movie that is all about glamour.
p284
aVI could do a whole talk on "The Matrix" and glamour.
p285
aVIt was criticized for glamorizing violence,
p286
aVbecause, look \u2014 sunglasses and those long coats, and, of course,
p287
aVthey could walk up walls and do all these kinds of things
p288
aVthat are impossible in the real world.
p289
aVThis is another Margaret Bourke-White photo.
p290
aVThis is from Soviet Union. Attractive.
p291
aVI mean, look how happy the people are, and good-looking too.
p292
aVYou know, we're marching toward Utopia.
p293
aa(lp294
VI'm not a fan of PETA, but I think this is a great ad.
p295
aVBecause what they're doing is they're saying,
p296
aVyour coat's not so glamorous, what's been edited out is something important.
p297
aVBut actually, what's even more important
p298
aVthan remembering what's been edited out is thinking, are the ideals good?
p299
aVBecause glamour can be very totalitarian and deceptive.
p300
aVAnd it's not just a matter of glamorizing cleaning your floor.
p301
aVThis is from "Triumph Of The Will" \u2014
p302
aVbrilliant editing to cut together things.
p303
aVThere's a glamour shot.
p304
aVNational Socialism is all about glamour.
p305
aVIt was a very aesthetic ideology.
p306
aVIt was all about cleaning up Germany, and the West, and the world,
p307
aVand ridding it of anything unglamorous.
p308
aVSo glamour can be dangerous.
p309
aa(lp310
VI think glamour has a genuine appeal, has a genuine value.
p311
aVI'm not against glamour.
p312
aVBut there's a kind of wonder in the stuff that gets edited away in the cords of life.
p313
aVAnd there is both a way to avoid the dangers of glamour
p314
aVand a way to broaden your appreciation of it.
p315
aVAnd that's to take Isaac Mizrahi's advice
p316
aVand confront the manipulation of it all,
p317
aVand sort of admit that manipulation is something that we enjoy,
p318
aVbut also enjoy how it happens.
p319
aVAnd here's Hedy Lamarr.
p320
aVShe's very glamorous but, you know, she invented spread-spectrum technology.
p321
aVSo she's even more glamorous if you know that she really wasn't stupid,
p322
aVeven though she thought she could look stupid.
p323
aa(lp324
VDavid Hockney talks about how the appreciation of this
p325
aVvery glamorous painting is heightened if you think about
p326
aVthe fact that it takes two weeks to paint this splash,
p327
aVwhich only took a fraction of a second to happen.
p328
aVThere is a book out in the bookstore \u2014
p329
aVit's called "Symphony In Steel,"
p330
aVand it's about the stuff that's hidden under the skin of the Disney Center.
p331
aVAnd that has a fascination.
p332
aVIt's not necessarily glamorous, but unveiling the glamour has an appeal.
p333
aVThere's a wonderful book called "Crowns"
p334
aVthat's all these glamour pictures of black women in their church hats.
p335
aVAnd there's a quote from one of these women, and she talks about,
p336
aV"As a little girl, I'd admire women at church with beautiful hats.
p337
aVThey looked like beautiful dolls, like they'd just stepped out of a magazine.
p338
aVBut I also knew how hard they worked all week.
p339
aVSometimes under those hats there's a lot of joy and a lot of sorrow."
p340
aVAnd, actually, you get more appreciation for glamour
p341
aVwhen you realize what went into creating it.
p342
aVThank you.
