VThis is the Bop.
p4
aa(lp5
VThe Bop is a type of social dance.
p6
aa(lp7
VDance is a language,
p8
aVand social dance is an expression that emerges from a community.
p9
aVA social dance isn't choreographed by any one person.
p10
aVIt can't be traced to any one moment.
p11
aa(lp12
VEach dance has steps that everyone can agree on,
p13
aVbut it's about the individual and their creative identity.
p14
aVBecause of that,
p15
aVsocial dances bubble up,
p16
aVthey change
p17
aVand they spread like wildfire.
p18
aa(lp19
VThey are as old as our remembered history.
p20
aVIn African-American social dances,
p21
aVwe see over 200 years
p22
aVof how African and African-American traditions influenced our history.
p23
aVThe present always contains the past.

aVAnd the past shapes who we are
p25
aVand who we will be.

VThe Juba dance was born from enslaved Africans' experience
p30
aVon the plantation.
p31
aVBrought to the Americas,
p32
aVstripped of a common spoken language,
p33
aVthis dance was a way for enslaved Africans to remember where they're from.
p34
aVIt may have looked something like this.
p35
aa(lp36
VSlapping thighs,
p37
aVshuffling feet
p38
aVand patting hands:
p39
aVthis was how they got around the slave owners' ban on drumming,
p40
aVimprovising complex rhythms
p41
aVjust like ancestors did with drums in Haiti
p42
aVor in the Yoruba communities of West Africa.
p43
aVIt was about keeping cultural traditions alive
p44
aVand retaining a sense of inner freedom
p45
aVunder captivity.
p46
aa(lp47
VIt was the same subversive spirit that created this dance:
p48
aVthe Cakewalk,
p49
aVa dance that parodied the mannerisms of Southern high society \u2014
p50
aVa way for the enslaved to throw shade at the masters.
p51
aVThe crazy thing about this dance
p52
aVis that the Cakewalk was performed for the masters,
p53
aVwho never suspected they were being made fun of.
p54
aa(lp55
VNow you might recognize this one.
p56
aV1920s \u2014
p57
aVthe Charleston.
p58
aVThe Charleston was all about improvisation and musicality,
p59
aVmaking its way into Lindy Hop,
p60
aVswing dancing
p61
aVand even the Kid n Play,
p62
aVoriginally called the Funky Charleston.
p63
aa(lp64
VStarted by a tight-knit Black community near Charleston, South Carolina,
p65
aVthe Charleston permeated dance halls
p66
aVwhere young women suddenly had the freedom to kick their heels
p67
aVand move their legs.
p68
aa(lp69
VNow, social dance is about community and connection;
p70
aVif you knew the steps,
p71
aVit meant you belonged to a group.
p72
aVBut what if it becomes a worldwide craze?
p73
aVEnter the Twist.
p74
aVIt's no surprise that the Twist can be traced back to the 19th century,
p75
aVbrought to America from the Congo
p76
aVduring slavery.
p77
aVBut in the late '50s,
p78
aVright before the Civil Rights Movement,
p79
aVthe Twist is popularized by Chubby Checker and Dick Clark.
p80
aVSuddenly, everybody's doing the Twist:
p81
aVwhite teenagers,
p82
aVkids in Latin America,
p83
aVmaking its way into songs and movies.
p84
aVThrough social dance,
p85
aVthe boundaries between groups become blurred.
p86
aa(lp87
VThe story continues in the 1980s and '90s.
p88
aVAlong with the emergence of hip-hop,
p89
aVAfrican-American social dance took on even more visibility,
p90
aVborrowing from its long past,
p91
aVshaping culture and being shaped by it.
p92
aa(lp93
VToday, these dances continue to evolve, grow and spread.
p94
aa(lp95
VWhy do we dance?
p96
aVTo move,
p97
aVto let loose,
p98
aVto express.
p99
aVWhy do we dance together?
p100
aVTo heal,
p101
aVto remember,
p102
aVto say: "We speak a common language.
p103
aVWe exist
p104
aVand we are free."
