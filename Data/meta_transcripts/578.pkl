VMy journey to coming here today
p4
aVstarted in 1974.
p5
aVThat's me with the funny gloves.
p6
aVI was 17 and going on a peace walk.
p7
aVWhat I didn't know though, was most of those people, standing there
p8
aVwith me, were Moonies.
p9
aV(Laughter)
p10
aVAnd within a week
p11
aVI had come to believe
p12
aVthat the second coming of Christ had occurred,
p13
aVthat it was Sun Myung Moon,
p14
aVand that I had been specially chosen and prepared by God
p15
aVto be his disciple.
p16
aa(lp17
VNow as cool as that sounds,
p18
aVmy family was not that thrilled with this.
p19
aV(Laughter)
p20
aVAnd they tried everything they could to get me out of there.
p21
aVThere was an underground railroad of sorts
p22
aVthat was going on during those years. Maybe some of you remember it.
p23
aVThey were called deprogrammers.
p24
aVAnd after about five long years
p25
aVmy family had me deprogrammed.
p26
aVAnd I then became a deprogrammer.
p27
aVI started going out on cases.
p28
aVAnd after about five years of doing this,
p29
aVI was arrested for kidnapping.
p30
aVMost of the cases I went out on
p31
aVwere called involuntary.
p32
aVWhat happened was that the family
p33
aVhad to get their loved ones some safe place somehow.
p34
aVAnd so they took them to some safe place.
p35
aVAnd we would come in and talk to them, usually for about a week.
p36
aVAnd so after this happened,
p37
aVI decided it was a good time to turn my back on this work.
p38
aa(lp39
VAnd about 20 years went by.
p40
aVThere was a burning question though that would not leave me.
p41
aVAnd that was, "How did this happen to me?"
p42
aVAnd in fact, what did happen to my brain?
p43
aVBecause something did.
p44
aVAnd so I decided to write a book, a memoir,
p45
aVabout this decade of my life.
p46
aa(lp47
VAnd toward the end of writing that book
p48
aVthere was a documentary that came out.
p49
aVIt was on Jonestown.
p50
aVAnd it had a chilling effect on me.
p51
aVThese are the dead in Jonestown.
p52
aVAbout 900 people died that day,
p53
aVmost of them taking their own lives.
p54
aVWomen gave poison to their babies,
p55
aVand watched foam come from their mouths as they died.
p56
aa(lp57
VThe top picture is a group of Moonies
p58
aVthat have been blessed by their messiah.
p59
aVTheir mates were chosen for them.
p60
aVThe bottom picture is Hitler youth.
p61
aVThis is the leg of a suicide bomber.
p62
aVThe thing I had to admit to myself,
p63
aVwith great repulsion,
p64
aVwas that I get it.
p65
aVI understand how this could happen.
p66
aVI understand how someone's brain,
p67
aVhow someone's mind can come to the place
p68
aVwhere it makes sense \u2014
p69
aVin fact it would be wrong, when your brain is working like that \u2014
p70
aVnot to try to save the world through genocide.
p71
aa(lp72
VAnd so what is this? How does this work?
p73
aVAnd how I've come to view what happened to me
p74
aVis a viral, memetic infection.
p75
aVFor those of you who aren't familiar with memetics,
p76
aVa meme has been defined as
p77
aVan idea that replicates in the human brain
p78
aVand moves from brain to brain like a virus,
p79
aVmuch like a virus. The way a virus works is \u2014
p80
aVit can infect and do the most damage to someone
p81
aVwho has a compromised immune system.
p82
aa(lp83
VIn 1974, I was young, I was naive,
p84
aVand I was pretty lost in my world.
p85
aVI was really idealistic.
p86
aVThese easy ideas to complex questions are very appealing
p87
aVwhen you are emotionally vulnerable.
p88
aVWhat happens is that
p89
aVcircular logic takes over.
p90
aV"Moon is one with God.
p91
aVGod is going to fix all the problems in the world.
p92
aVAll I have to do is humbly follow.
p93
aVBecause God is going to stop war and hunger \u2014
p94
aVall these things I wanted to do \u2014
p95
aVall I have to do is humbly follow.
p96
aVBecause after all, God is [working through] the messiah. He's going to fix all this."
p97
aVIt becomes impenetrable.
p98
aVAnd the most dangerous part of this
p99
aVis that is creates "us" and "them,"
p100
aV"right" and "wrong,"
p101
aV"good" and "evil."
p102
aVAnd it makes anything possible,
p103
aVmakes anything rationalizable.
p104
aa(lp105
VAnd the thing is, though,
p106
aVif you looked at my brain
p107
aVduring those years in the Moonies \u2014
p108
aVneuroscience is expanding exponentially,
p109
aVas Ray Kurzweil said yesterday. Science is expanding.
p110
aVWe're beginning to look inside the brain.
p111
aVAnd so if you looked at my brain, or any brain that's infected with
p112
aVa viral memetic infection like this,
p113
aVand compared it to anyone in this room,
p114
aVor anyone who uses critical thinking on a regular basis,
p115
aVI am convinced it would look very, very different.
p116
aa(lp117
VAnd that, strange as it may sound,
p118
aVgives me hope.
p119
aVAnd the reason that gives me hope
p120
aVis that the first thing is to admit
p121
aVthat we have a problem.
p122
aVBut it's a human problem. It's a scientific problem, if you will.
p123
aVIt happens in the human brain. There is no evil force out there to get us.
p124
aVAnd so this is something that, through research and education,
p125
aVI believe that we can solve.
p126
aVAnd so the first step is to realize
p127
aVthat we can do this together,
p128
aVand that there is no "us" and "them."
p129
aVThank you very much. (Applause)
