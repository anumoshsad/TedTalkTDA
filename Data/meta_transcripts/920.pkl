VWell, indeed, I'm very, very lucky.
p4
aVMy talk essentially got written
p5
aVby three historic events
p6
aVthat happened within days of each other
p7
aVin the last two months \u2014
p8
aVseemingly unrelated, but as you will see,
p9
aVactually all having to do with
p10
aVthe story I want to tell you today.
p11
aVThe first one was actually a funeral \u2014
p12
aVto be more precise, a reburial.
p13
aVOn May 22nd, there was a hero's reburial
p14
aVin Frombork, Poland
p15
aVof the 16th-century astronomer
p16
aVwho actually changed the world.
p17
aVHe did that, literally,
p18
aVby replacing the Earth with the Sun
p19
aVin the center of the Solar System,
p20
aVand then with this simple-looking act,
p21
aVhe actually launched a scientific
p22
aVand technological revolution,
p23
aVwhich many call the Copernican Revolution.
p24
aVNow that was,
p25
aVironically, and very befittingly,
p26
aVthe way we found his grave.
p27
aVAs it was the custom of the time,
p28
aVCopernicus was actually
p29
aVsimply buried in an unmarked grave,
p30
aVtogether with 14 others
p31
aVin that cathedral.
p32
aVDNA analysis,
p33
aVone of the hallmarks
p34
aVof the scientific revolution
p35
aVof the last 400 years that he started,
p36
aVwas the way we found
p37
aVwhich set of bones
p38
aVactually belonged to the person
p39
aVwho read all those astronomical books
p40
aVwhich were filled with leftover hair
p41
aVthat was Copernicus' hair \u2014
p42
aVobviously not many other people
p43
aVbothered to read these books later on.
p44
aVThat match was unambiguous.
p45
aVThe DNA matched,
p46
aVand we know that this was indeed
p47
aVNicolaus Copernicus.
p48
aa(lp49
VNow, the connection between
p50
aVbiology and DNA
p51
aVand life
p52
aVis very tantalizing when you talk about Copernicus
p53
aVbecause, even back then,
p54
aVhis followers
p55
aVvery quickly made the logical step
p56
aVto ask: if the Earth is just a planet,
p57
aVthen what about planets around other stars?
p58
aVWhat about the idea of the plurality of the worlds,
p59
aVabout life on other planets?
p60
aVIn fact, I'm borrowing here from one of those
p61
aVvery popular books of the time.
p62
aVAnd at the time,
p63
aVpeople actually answered that question
p64
aVpositively: "Yes."
p65
aVBut there was no evidence.
p66
aVAnd here begins 400 years
p67
aVof frustration, of unfulfilled dreams \u2014
p68
aVthe dreams of Galileo, Giordano Bruno,
p69
aVmany others \u2014
p70
aVwhich never led to the answer
p71
aVof those very basic questions
p72
aVwhich humanity has asked all the time.
p73
aV"What is life? What is the origin of life?
p74
aVAre we alone?"
p75
aVAnd that especially happened in the last 10 years,
p76
aVat the end of the 20th century,
p77
aVwhen the beautiful developments
p78
aVdue to molecular biology,
p79
aVunderstanding the code of life, DNA,
p80
aVall of that seemed to actually
p81
aVput us, not closer,
p82
aVbut further apart from answering
p83
aVthose basic questions.
p84
aa(lp85
VNow, the good news.
p86
aVA lot has happened in the last few years,
p87
aVand let's start with the planets.
p88
aVLet's start with the old Copernican question:
p89
aVAre there earths around other stars?
p90
aVAnd as we already heard,
p91
aVthere is a way in which
p92
aVwe are trying, and now able,
p93
aVto answer that question.
p94
aVIt's a new telescope.
p95
aVOur team, befittingly I think,
p96
aVnamed it after one of those dreamers
p97
aVof the Copernican time,
p98
aVJohannes Kepler,
p99
aVand that telescope's sole purpose
p100
aVis to go out,
p101
aVfind the planets that orbit
p102
aVother stars in our galaxy,
p103
aVand tell us how often do planets like our own Earth
p104
aVhappen to be out there.
p105
aVThe telescope is actually
p106
aVbuilt similarly to
p107
aVthe, well-known to you, Hubble Space Telescope,
p108
aVexcept it does have an additional lens \u2014
p109
aVa wide-field lens,
p110
aVas you would call it as a photographer.
p111
aVAnd if, in the next couple of months,
p112
aVyou walk out in the early evening
p113
aVand look straight up
p114
aVand place you palm like this,
p115
aVyou will actually be looking at the field of the sky
p116
aVwhere this telescope is searching for planets
p117
aVday and night, without any interruption,
p118
aVfor the next four years.
p119
aa(lp120
VThe way we do that, actually,
p121
aVis with a method, which we call the transit method.
p122
aVIt's actually mini-eclipses that occur
p123
aVwhen a planet passes in front of its star.
p124
aVNot all of the planets will be fortuitously oriented
p125
aVfor us to be able do that,
p126
aVbut if you have a million stars,
p127
aVyou'll find enough planets.
p128
aVAnd as you see on this animation,
p129
aVwhat Kepler is going to detect
p130
aVis just the dimming of the light from the star.
p131
aVWe are not going to see the image of the star and the planet as this.
p132
aVAll the stars for Kepler are just points of light.
p133
aVBut we learn a lot from that:
p134
aVnot only that there is a planet there, but we also learn its size.
p135
aVHow much of the light is being dimmed
p136
aVdepends on how big the planet is.
p137
aVWe learn about its orbit,
p138
aVthe period of its orbit and so on.
p139
aVSo, what have we learned?
p140
aVWell, let me try to walk you through
p141
aVwhat we actually see
p142
aVand so you understand the news
p143
aVthat I'm here to tell you today.
p144
aa(lp145
VWhat Kepler does
p146
aVis discover a lot of candidates,
p147
aVwhich we then follow up and find as planets,
p148
aVconfirm as planets.
p149
aVIt basically tells us
p150
aVthis is the distribution of planets in size.
p151
aVThere are small planets, there are bigger planets, there are big planets, okay.
p152
aVSo we count many, many such planets,
p153
aVand they have different sizes.
p154
aVWe do that in our solar system.
p155
aVIn fact, even back during the ancients,
p156
aVthe Solar System in that sense
p157
aVwould look on a diagram like this.
p158
aVThere will be the smaller planets, and there will be the big planets,
p159
aVeven back to the time of Epicurus
p160
aVand then of course Copernicus
p161
aVand his followers.
p162
aVUp until recently, that was the Solar System \u2014
p163
aVfour Earth-like planets with small radius,
p164
aVsmaller than about two times the size of the Earth \u2014
p165
aVand that was of course Mercury,
p166
aVVenus, Mars,
p167
aVand of course the Earth,
p168
aVand then the two big, giant planets.
p169
aVThen the Copernican Revolution
p170
aVbrought in telescopes,
p171
aVand of course three more planets were discovered.
p172
aVNow the total planet number
p173
aVin our solar system was nine.
p174
aVThe small planets dominated,
p175
aVand there was a certain harmony to that,
p176
aVwhich actually Copernicus was very happy to note,
p177
aVand Kepler was one of the big proponents of.
p178
aVSo now we have Pluto to join the numbers of small planets.
p179
aVBut up until, literally, 15 years ago,
p180
aVthat was all we knew about planets.
p181
aVAnd that's what the frustration was.
p182
aVThe Copernican dream was unfulfilled.
p183
aa(lp184
VFinally, 15 years ago,
p185
aVthe technology came to the point
p186
aVwhere we could discover a planet around another star,
p187
aVand we actually did pretty well.
p188
aVIn the next 15 years,
p189
aValmost 500 planets
p190
aVwere discovered orbiting other stars, with different methods.
p191
aVUnfortunately, as you can see,
p192
aVthere was a very different picture.
p193
aVThere was of course an explanation for it:
p194
aVWe only see the big planets,
p195
aVso that's why most of those planets
p196
aVare really in the category of "like Jupiter."
p197
aVBut you see, we haven't gone very far.
p198
aVWe were still back where Copernicus was.
p199
aVWe didn't have any evidence
p200
aVwhether planets like the Earth are out there.
p201
aVAnd we do care about planets like the Earth
p202
aVbecause by now we understood
p203
aVthat life as a chemical system
p204
aVreally needs a smaller planet
p205
aVwith water and with rocks
p206
aVand with a lot of complex chemistry
p207
aVto originate, to emerge, to survive.
p208
aVAnd we didn't have the evidence for that.
p209
aa(lp210
VSo today, I'm here to actually give you a first glimpse
p211
aVof what the new telescope, Kepler,
p212
aVhas been able to tell us in the last few weeks,
p213
aVand, lo and behold,
p214
aVwe are back to the harmony
p215
aVand to fulfilling the dreams of Copernicus.
p216
aVYou can see here,
p217
aVthe small planets dominate the picture.
p218
aVThe planets which are marked "like Earth,"
p219
aV[are] definitely more than
p220
aVany other planets that we see.
p221
aVAnd now for the first time, we can say that.
p222
aVThere is a lot more work we need to do with this.
p223
aVMost of these are candidates.
p224
aVIn the next few years we will confirm them.
p225
aVBut the statistical result
p226
aVis loud and clear.
p227
aVAnd the statistical result is that
p228
aVplanets like our own Earth
p229
aVare out there.
p230
aVOur own Milky Way Galaxy is rich in this kind of planets.
p231
aa(lp232
VSo the question is: what do we do next?
p233
aVWell, first of all, we can study them
p234
aVnow that we know where they are.
p235
aVAnd we can find those that we would call habitable,
p236
aVmeaning that they have similar conditions
p237
aVto the conditions
p238
aVthat we experience here on Earth
p239
aVand where a lot of complex chemistry can happen.
p240
aVSo, we can even put a number
p241
aVto how many of those planets
p242
aVnow do we expect our own
p243
aVMilky Way Galaxy harbors.
p244
aVAnd the number, as you might expect,
p245
aVis pretty staggering.
p246
aVIt's about 100 million such planets.
p247
aVThat's great news. Why?
p248
aVBecause with our own little telescope,
p249
aVjust in the next two years,
p250
aVwe'll be able to identify at least 60 of them.
p251
aVSo that's great because then
p252
aVwe can go and study them \u2014
p253
aVremotely, of course \u2014
p254
aVwith all the techniques that we already have
p255
aVtested in the past five years.
p256
aVWe can find what they're made of,
p257
aVwould their atmospheres have water, carbon dioxide, methane.
p258
aVWe know and expect that we'll see that.
p259
aa(lp260
VThat's great, but that is not the whole news.
p261
aVThat's not why I'm here.
p262
aVWhy I'm here is to tell you that the next step
p263
aVis really the exciting part.
p264
aVThe one that this step
p265
aVis enabling us to do is coming next.
p266
aVAnd here comes biology \u2014
p267
aVbiology, with its basic question,
p268
aVwhich still stands unanswered,
p269
aVwhich is essentially:
p270
aV"If there is life on other planets,
p271
aVdo we expect it to be like life on Earth?"
p272
aVAnd let me immediately tell you here,
p273
aVwhen I say life, I don't mean "dolce vita,"
p274
aVgood life, human life.
p275
aVI really mean life
p276
aVon Earth, past and present,
p277
aVfrom microbes to us humans,
p278
aVin its rich molecular diversity,
p279
aVthe way we now understand life on Earth
p280
aVas being a set of molecules and chemical reactions \u2014
p281
aVand we call that, collectively, biochemistry,
p282
aVlife as a chemical process,
p283
aVas a chemical phenomenon.
p284
aa(lp285
VSo the question is:
p286
aVis that chemical phenomenon universal,
p287
aVor is it something
p288
aVwhich depends on the planet?
p289
aVIs it like gravity,
p290
aVwhich is the same everywhere in the universe,
p291
aVor there would be all kinds of different biochemistries
p292
aVwherever we find them?
p293
aVWe need to know what we are looking for
p294
aVwhen we try to do that.
p295
aVAnd that's a very basic question, which we don't know the answer to,
p296
aVbut which we can try \u2014
p297
aVand we are trying \u2014 to answer in the lab.
p298
aVWe don't need to go to space
p299
aVto answer that question.
p300
aVAnd so, that's what we are trying to do.
p301
aVAnd that's what many people now are trying to do.
p302
aVAnd a lot of the good news comes from that part of the bridge
p303
aVthat we are trying to build as well.
p304
aa(lp305
VSo this is one example
p306
aVthat I want to show you here.
p307
aVWhen we think of what is necessary
p308
aVfor the phenomenon that we call life,
p309
aVwe think of compartmentalization,
p310
aVkeeping the molecules which are important for life
p311
aVin a membrane,
p312
aVisolated from the rest of the environment,
p313
aVbut yet, in an environment in which
p314
aVthey actually could originate together.
p315
aVAnd in one of our labs,
p316
aVJack Szostak's labs,
p317
aVit was a series of experiments
p318
aVin the last four years
p319
aVthat showed that the environments \u2014
p320
aVwhich are very common on planets,
p321
aVon certain types of planets like the Earth,
p322
aVwhere you have some liquid water and some clays \u2014
p323
aVyou actually end up with
p324
aVnaturally available molecules
p325
aVwhich spontaneously form bubbles.
p326
aVBut those bubbles have membranes
p327
aVvery similar to the membrane of every cell
p328
aVof every living thing on Earth looks like,
p329
aVlike this.
p330
aVAnd they really help molecules,
p331
aVlike nucleic acids, like RNA and DNA,
p332
aVstay inside, develop,
p333
aVchange, divide
p334
aVand do some of the processes that we call life.
p335
aa(lp336
VNow this is just an example
p337
aVto tell you the pathway
p338
aVin which we are trying to answer
p339
aVthat bigger question about the universality of the phenomenon.
p340
aVAnd in a sense, you can think of that work
p341
aVthat people are starting to do now around the world
p342
aVas building a bridge,
p343
aVbuilding a bridge from two sides of the river.
p344
aVOn one hand, on the left bank of the river,
p345
aVare the people like me who study those planets
p346
aVand try to define the environments.
p347
aVWe don't want to go blind because there's too many possibilities,
p348
aVand there is not too much lab,
p349
aVand there is not enough human time
p350
aVto actually to do all the experiments.
p351
aVSo that's what we are building from the left side of the river.
p352
aVFrom the right bank of the river
p353
aVare the experiments in the lab that I just showed you,
p354
aVwhere we actually tried that, and it feeds back and forth,
p355
aVand we hope to meet in the middle one day.
p356
aa(lp357
VSo why should you care about that?
p358
aVWhy am I trying to sell you
p359
aVa half-built bridge?
p360
aVAm I that charming?
p361
aVWell, there are many reasons,
p362
aVand you heard some of them
p363
aVin the short talk today.
p364
aVThis understanding of chemistry
p365
aVactually can help us
p366
aVwith our daily lives.
p367
aVBut there is something more profound here,
p368
aVsomething deeper.
p369
aVAnd that deeper, underlying point
p370
aVis that science
p371
aVis in the process of redefining life
p372
aVas we know it.
p373
aVAnd that is going to change
p374
aVour worldview in a profound way \u2014
p375
aVnot in a dissimilar way
p376
aVas 400 years ago,
p377
aVCopernicus' act did,
p378
aVby changing the way
p379
aVwe view space and time.
p380
aVNow it's about something else,
p381
aVbut it's equally profound.
p382
aVAnd half the time,
p383
aVwhat's happened
p384
aVis it's related this kind of
p385
aVsense of insignificance
p386
aVto humankind,
p387
aVto the Earth in a bigger space.
p388
aVAnd the more we learn,
p389
aVthe more that was reinforced.
p390
aVYou've all learned that in school \u2014
p391
aVhow small the Earth is
p392
aVcompared to the immense universe.
p393
aVAnd the bigger the telescope,
p394
aVthe bigger that universe becomes.
p395
aVAnd look at this image of the tiny, blue dot.
p396
aVThis pixel is the Earth.
p397
aVIt is the Earth as we know it.
p398
aVIt is seen from, in this case,
p399
aVfrom outside the orbit of Saturn.
p400
aVBut it's really tiny.
p401
aVWe know that.
p402
aVLet's think of life as that entire planet
p403
aVbecause, in a sense, it is.
p404
aVThe biosphere is the size of the Earth.
p405
aVLife on Earth
p406
aVis the size of the Earth.
p407
aVAnd let's compare it to the rest of the world
p408
aVin spatial terms.
p409
aVWhat if that
p410
aVCopernican insignificance
p411
aVwas actually all wrong?
p412
aVWould that make us more responsible
p413
aVfor what is happening today?
p414
aVLet's actually try that.
p415
aa(lp416
VSo in space, the Earth is very small.
p417
aVCan you imagine how small it is?
p418
aVLet me try it.
p419
aVOkay, let's say
p420
aVthis is the size
p421
aVof the observable universe,
p422
aVwith all the galaxies,
p423
aVwith all the stars,
p424
aVokay, from here to here.
p425
aVDo you know what the size of life
p426
aVin this necktie will be?
p427
aVIt will be the size
p428
aVof a single, small atom.
p429
aVIt is unimaginably small.
p430
aVWe can't imagine it.
p431
aVI mean look, you can see the necktie,
p432
aVbut you can't even imagine seeing
p433
aVthe size of a little, small atom.
p434
aVBut that's not the whole story, you see.
p435
aVThe universe and life
p436
aVare both in space and time.
p437
aVIf that was
p438
aVthe age of the universe,
p439
aVthen this is the age of life on Earth.
p440
aVThink about those oldest living things on Earth,
p441
aVbut in a cosmic proportion.
p442
aVThis is not insignificant.
p443
aVThis is very significant.
p444
aVSo life might be insignificant in size,
p445
aVbut it is not insignificant in time.
p446
aVLife and the universe
p447
aVcompare to each other like a child and a parent,
p448
aVparent and offspring.
p449
aa(lp450
VSo what does this tell us?
p451
aVThis tells us that
p452
aVthat insignificance paradigm
p453
aVthat we somehow got to learn
p454
aVfrom the Copernican principle,
p455
aVit's all wrong.
p456
aVThere is immense, powerful potential
p457
aVin life in this universe \u2014
p458
aVespecially now that we know
p459
aVthat places like the Earth are common.
p460
aVAnd that potential, that powerful potential,
p461
aVis also our potential,
p462
aVof you and me.
p463
aVAnd if we are to be stewards
p464
aVof our planet Earth
p465
aVand its biosphere,
p466
aVwe'd better understand
p467
aVthe cosmic significance
p468
aVand do something about it.
p469
aVAnd the good news is we can
p470
aVactually, indeed do it.
p471
aVAnd let's do it.
p472
aVLet's start this new revolution
p473
aVat the tail end of the old one,
p474
aVwith synthetic biology being
p475
aVthe way to transform
p476
aVboth our environment
p477
aVand our future.
p478
aVAnd let's hope that we can build this bridge together
p479
aVand meet in the middle.
