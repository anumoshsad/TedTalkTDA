VSo there's this thing called the law of unintended consequences.
p4
aVI thought it was just like a saying,
p5
aVbut it actually exists, I guess.
p6
aVThere's, like, academic papers about it.
p7
aVAnd I'm a designer.
p8
aVI don't like unintended consequences.
p9
aVPeople hire me because they have consequences that they really intend,
p10
aVand what they intend is for me to help them achieve those consequences.
p11
aVSo I live in fear of unintended consequences.
p12
aVAnd so this is a story about consequences intended and unintended.
p13
aa(lp14
VI got called by an organization called Robin Hood
p15
aVto do a favor for them.
p16
aVRobin Hood is based in New York, a wonderful philanthropic organization
p17
aVthat does what it says in the name.
p18
aVThey take from rich people, give it to poor people.
p19
aVIn this case, what they wanted to benefit was the New York City school system,
p20
aVa huge enterprise that educates more than a million students at a time,
p21
aVand in buildings that are like this one,
p22
aVold buildings, big buildings,
p23
aVdrafty buildings, sometimes buildings that are in disrepair,
p24
aVcertainly buildings that could use a renovation.
p25
aVRobin Hood had this ambition to improve these buildings in some way,
p26
aVbut what they realized was
p27
aVto fix the buildings would be too expensive and impractical.
p28
aVSo instead they tried to figure out what one room they could go into
p29
aVin each of these buildings, in as many buildings that they could,
p30
aVand fix that one room
p31
aVso that they could improve the lives of the children inside
p32
aVas they were studying.
p33
aVAnd what they came up with was the school library,
p34
aVand they came up with this idea called the Library Initiative.
p35
aVAll the students have to pass through the library.
p36
aVThat's where the books are.
p37
aVThat's where the heart and soul of the school is.
p38
aVSo let's fix these libraries.
p39
aa(lp40
VSo they did this wonderful thing where they brought in
p41
aVfirst 10, then 20, then more architects,
p42
aVeach one of whom was assigned a library to rethink what a library was.
p43
aVThey trained special librarians.
p44
aVSo they started this mighty enterprise
p45
aVto reform public schools by improving these libraries.
p46
aVThen they called me up and they said, "Could you make a little contribution?"
p47
aVI said, "Sure, what do you want me to do?"
p48
aVAnd they said, "Well, we want you to be the graphic designer
p49
aVin charge of the whole thing."
p50
aVAnd so I thought, I know what that means. That means I get to design a logo.
p51
aVI know how to design that. I design logos.
p52
aVThat's what people come to me for.
p53
aVSo OK, let's design a logo for this thing.
p54
aVEasy to do, actually, compared with architecture
p55
aVand being a librarian.
p56
aVJust do a logo, make a contribution, and then you're out,
p57
aVand you feel really good about yourself.
p58
aVAnd I'm a great guy and I like to feel good about myself when I do these favors.
p59
aa(lp60
VSo I thought, let's overdeliver.
p61
aVI'm going to give you three logos, all based on this one idea.
p62
aVSo you have three options, pick any of the three.
p63
aVThey're all great, I said.
p64
aVSo the basic idea was these would be new school libraries
p65
aVfor New York schools,
p66
aVand so the idea is that it's a new thing, a new idea that needs a new name.
p67
aVWhat I wanted to do was dispel the idea that these were musty old libraries,
p68
aVthe kind of places that everyone is bored with,
p69
aVyou know, not your grandparents' library.
p70
aVDon't worry about that at all.
p71
aVThis is going to this new, exciting thing,
p72
aVnot a boring library.
p73
aa(lp74
VSo option number one:
p75
aVso instead of thinking of it as a library,
p76
aVthink of it as a place where it is like: do talk, do make loud noises.
p77
aVRight? So no shushing, it's like a shush-free zone.
p78
aVWe're going to call it the Reading Room.
p79
aa(lp80
VThat was option number one. OK, option number two.
p81
aVOption number two was, wait for it,
p82
aVOWL.
p83
aVI'll meet you at OWL.
p84
aVI'm getting my book from the OWL. Meet you after school down at OWL.
p85
aVI like that, right? Now, what does OWL stand for?
p86
aVWell, it could be One World Library,
p87
aVor it could be Open. Wonder. Learn.
p88
aVOr it could be \u2014 and I figure librarians could figure out other things it could be
p89
aVbecause they know about words.
p90
aVSo other things, right?
p91
aVAnd then look at this. It's like the eye of the owl.
p92
aVThis is irresistible in my opinion.
p93
aa(lp94
VBut there's even another idea.
p95
aVOption number three.
p96
aVOption number three was based actually on language.
p97
aVIt's the idea that "read" is the past tense of "read,"
p98
aVand they're both spelled the same way.
p99
aVSo why don't we call this place The Red Zone?
p100
aVI'll meet you at the Red Zone.
p101
aVAre you Red? Get Red.
p102
aVI'm well Red.
p103
aa(lp104
V(Laughter)
p105
aa(lp106
VI really loved this idea,
p107
aVand I somehow was not focused on the idea
p108
aVthat librarians as a class are sort of interested in spelling and I don't know.
p109
aa(lp110
V(Laughter)
p111
aa(lp112
VBut sometimes cleverness is more important than spelling,
p113
aVand I thought this would be one of those instances.
p114
aVSo usually when I make these presentations
p115
aVI say there's just one question and the question should be,
p116
aV"How can I thank you, Mike?"
p117
aVBut in this case, the question was more like,
p118
aV"Um, are you kidding?"
p119
aVBecause, they said,
p120
aVthe premise of all this work
p121
aVwas that kids were bored with old libraries, musty old libraries.
p122
aVThey were tired of them.
p123
aVAnd instead, they said, these kids have never really seen a library.
p124
aVThe school libraries in these schools
p125
aVare really so dilapidated, if they're there at all,
p126
aVthat they haven't bored anyone.
p127
aVThey haven't even been there to bore anyone at all.
p128
aVSo the idea was, just forget about giving it a new name.
p129
aVJust call it, one last try, a library.
p130
aVRight? OK.
p131
aVSo I thought, OK, give it a little oomph?
p132
aVExclamation point?
p133
aVThen \u2014 this is because I'm clever \u2014
p134
aVmove that into the "i,"
p135
aVmake it red,
p136
aVand there you have it, the Library Initiative.
p137
aVSo I thought, mission accomplished, there's your logo.
p138
aVSo what's interesting about this logo, an unintended consequence,
p139
aVwas that it turned out that they didn't really even need my design
p140
aVbecause you could type it any font, you could write it by hand,
p141
aVand when they started sending emails around,
p142
aVthey just would use Shift and 1,
p143
aVthey'd get their own logo just right out of the thing.
p144
aVAnd I thought, well, that's fine.
p145
aVFeel free to use that logo.
p146
aVAnd then I embarked on the real rollout of this thing \u2014
p147
aVworking with every one of the architects
p148
aVto put this logo on the front door of their own library. Right?
p149
aa(lp150
VSo here's the big rollout.
p151
aVBasically I'd work with different architects.
p152
aVFirst Robin Hood was my client. Now these architects were my client.
p153
aVI'd say, "Here's your logo. Put it on the door."
p154
aV"Here's your logo. Put it on both doors."
p155
aV"Here's your logo. Put it off to the side."
p156
aV"Here's your logo repeated all over to the top."
p157
aVSo everything was going swimmingly.
p158
aVI just was saying, "Here's your logo. Here's your logo."
p159
aa(lp160
VThen I got a call from one of the architects,
p161
aVa guy named Richard Lewis, and he says, "I've got a problem.
p162
aVYou're the graphics guy. Can you solve it?"
p163
aVAnd I said, OK, sure."
p164
aVAnd he said, "The problem is that there's a space
p165
aVbetween the shelf and the ceiling."
p166
aVSo that sounds like an architectural issue to me,
p167
aVnot a graphic design issue, so I'm, "Go on."
p168
aVAnd Richard says, "Well, the top shelf has to be low enough
p169
aVfor the kid to reach it,
p170
aVbut I'm in a big old building, and the ceilings are really high,
p171
aVso actually I've got all this space up there
p172
aVand I need something like a mural."
p173
aVAnd I'm like, "Whoa, you know, I'm a logo designer.
p174
aVI'm not Diego Rivera or something.
p175
aVI'm not a muralist."
p176
aVAnd so he said, "But can't you think of anything?"
p177
aVSo I said, "OK, what if we just took pictures of the kids in the school
p178
aVand just put them around the top of the thing,
p179
aVand maybe that could work."
p180
aVAnd my wife is a photographer,
p181
aVand I said, "Dorothy, there's no budget,
p182
aVcan you come to this school in east New York, take these pictures?"
p183
aVAnd she did,
p184
aVand if you go in Richard's library,
p185
aVwhich is one of the first that opened,
p186
aVit has this glorious frieze of, like, the heroes of the school,
p187
aVoversized, looking down
p188
aVinto the little dollhouse of the real library, right?
p189
aVAnd the kids were great, hand-selected by the principals
p190
aVand the librarian.
p191
aVIt just kind of created this heroic atmosphere in this library,
p192
aVthis very dignified setting below and the joy of the children above.
p193
aa(lp194
VSo naturally all the other librarians in the other schools see this
p195
aVand they said, well, we want murals too.
p196
aVAnd I'm like, OK.
p197
aVSo then I think, well, it can't be the same mural every time,
p198
aVso Dorothy did another one, and then she did another one,
p199
aVbut then we needed more help,
p200
aVso I called an illustrator I knew named Lynn Pauley,
p201
aVand Lynn did these beautiful paintings of the kids.
p202
aVThen I called a guy named Charles Wilkin at a place called Automatic Design.
p203
aVHe did these amazing collages.
p204
aVWe had Rafael Esquer
p205
aVdo these great silhouettes.
p206
aVHe would work with the kids, asking for words,
p207
aVand then based on those prompts,
p208
aVcome up with this little, delirious kind of constellation
p209
aVof silhouettes of things that are in books.
p210
aVPeter Arkle interviewed the kids
p211
aVand had them talk about their favorite books
p212
aVand he put their testimony as a frieze up there.
p213
aVStefan Sagmeister worked with Yuko Shimizu
p214
aVand they did this amazing manga-style statement,
p215
aV"Everyone who is honest is interesting,"
p216
aVthat goes all the way around.
p217
aVChristoph Niemann, brilliant illustrator,
p218
aVdid a whole series of things
p219
aVwhere he embedded books into the faces and characters
p220
aVand images and places that you find in the books.
p221
aVAnd then even Maira Kalman
p222
aVdid this amazing cryptic installation of objects and words
p223
aVthat kind of go all around and will fascinate students
p224
aVfor as long as it's up there.
p225
aa(lp226
VSo this was really satisfying,
p227
aVand basically my role here was reading a series of dimensions to these artists,
p228
aVand I would say,
p229
aV"Three feet by 15 feet, whatever you want.
p230
aVLet me know if you have any problem with that."
p231
aVAnd they would go and install these. It just was the greatest thing.
p232
aa(lp233
VBut the greatest thing, actually, was \u2014
p234
aVEvery once in a while,
p235
aVI'd get, like, an invitation in the mail made of construction paper,
p236
aVand it would say, "You are invited to the opening of our new library."
p237
aVSo you'd go to the library, say, you'd go to PS10,
p238
aVand you'd go inside.
p239
aVThere'd be balloons, there'd be a student ambassador,
p240
aVthere'd be speeches that were read,
p241
aVpoetry that was written specifically for the opening,
p242
aVdignitaries would present people with certificates,
p243
aVand the whole thing was just a delirious, fun party.
p244
aVSo I loved going to these things.
p245
aVI would stand there dressed like this, obviously not belonging,
p246
aVand someone would say, "What are you doing here, mister?"
p247
aVAnd I'd say, "Well, I'm part of the team that designed this place."
p248
aVAnd they'd said, "You do these shelves?"
p249
aVAnd I said, "No." "You took the pictures up above."
p250
aV"No."
p251
aV"Well, what did you do?"
p252
aV"You know when you came in? The sign over the door?"
p253
aV"The sign that says library?"
p254
aa(lp255
V(Laughter)
p256
aa(lp257
V"Yeah, I did that!"
p258
aVAnd then they'd sort of go, "OK. Nice work if you can get it."
p259
aVSo it was so satisfying going to these little openings
p260
aVdespite the fact that I was kind of largely ignored or humiliated,
p261
aVbut it was actually fun going to the openings,
p262
aVso I decided that I wanted to get the people in my office
p263
aVwho had worked on these projects, get the illustrators and photographers,
p264
aVand I said, why don't we rent a van
p265
aVand drive around the five boroughs of New York
p266
aVand see how many we could hit at one time.
p267
aVAnd eventually there were going to be 60 of these libraries,
p268
aVso we probably got to see maybe half a dozen in one long day.
p269
aVAnd the best thing of all was meeting these librarians
p270
aVwho kind of were running these, took possession of these places
p271
aVlike their private stage upon which they were invited
p272
aVto mesmerize their students and bring the books to life,
p273
aVand it was just this really exciting experience
p274
aVfor all of us to actually see these things in action.
p275
aVSo we spent a long day doing this
p276
aVand we were in the very last library.
p277
aVIt was still winter, because it got dark early,
p278
aVand the librarian says,
p279
aV"I'm about to close down. So really nice having you here.
p280
aVHey, wait a second, do you want to see how I turn off the lights?"
p281
aVI'm like, "OK."
p282
aVAnd she said, "I have this special way that I do it."
p283
aVAnd then she showed me.
p284
aVWhat she did was she turned out every light one by one by one by one,
p285
aVand the last light she left on
p286
aVwas the light that illuminated the kids' faces,
p287
aVand she said, "That's the last light I turn off every night,
p288
aVbecause I like to remind myself why I come to work."
p289
aa(lp290
VSo when I started this whole thing,
p291
aVremember, it was just about designing that logo
p292
aVand being clever, come up with a new name?
p293
aVThe unintended consequence here,
p294
aVwhich I would like to take credit for
p295
aVand like to think I can think through the experience to that extent,
p296
aVbut I can't.
p297
aVI was just focused on a foot ahead of me, as far as I could reach with my own hands.
p298
aVInstead, way off in the distance
p299
aVwas a librarian
p300
aVwho was going to find the chain of consequences
p301
aVthat we had set in motion,
p302
aVa source of inspiration
p303
aVso that she in this case could do her work really well.
p304
aV40,000 kids a year are affected by these libraries.
p305
aVThey've been happening for more than 10 years now,
p306
aVso those librarians have kind of turned on a generation of children to books
p307
aVand so it's been a thrill to find out
p308
aVthat sometimes unintended consequences are the best consequences.
