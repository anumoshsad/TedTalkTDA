VBen Roche: So I'm Ben, by the way.
p4
aVHomaro Cantu: And I'm Homaro.
p5
aVBR: And we're chefs. So when Moto
p6
aVopened in 2004, people didn't really know
p7
aVwhat to expect. A lot of people thought
p8
aVthat it was a Japanese restaurant, and
p9
aVmaybe it was the name, maybe it was
p10
aVthe logo, which was like a Japanese
p11
aVcharacter, but anyway, we had all these
p12
aVrequests for Japanese food, which is
p13
aVreally not what we did. And after about
p14
aVthe ten thousandth request for a maki roll,
p15
aVwe decided to give the people
p16
aVwhat they wanted. So this picture is
p17
aVan example of printed food, and this was
p18
aVthe first foray into what we like to call
p19
aVflavor transformation. So this is all
p20
aVthe ingredients, all the flavor of, you know,
p21
aVa standard maki roll, printed onto
p22
aVa little piece of paper.
p23
aa(lp24
VHC: So our diners started to get bored
p25
aVwith this idea, and we decided to give them
p26
aVthe same course twice, so here we actually
p27
aVtook an element from the maki roll and
p28
aVand took a picture of a dish and then
p29
aVbasically served that picture with the dish.
p30
aVSo this dish in particular is basically
p31
aVchampagne with seafood.
p32
aVThe champagne grapes that you see are
p33
aVactually carbonated grapes. A little bit of
p34
aVseafood and some crème fraiche and the
p35
aVpicture actually tastes exactly like the dish. (Laughter)
p36
aVBR: But it's not all just edible pictures.
p37
aVWe decided to do something
p38
aVa little bit different and transform flavors
p39
aVthat were very familiar \u2014 so in this case,
p40
aVwe have carrot cake.
p41
aVSo we take a carrot cake, put it
p42
aVin a blender, and we have kind of like
p43
aVa carrot cake juice, and then that went into
p44
aVa balloon frozen in liquid nitrogen to create
p45
aVthis hollow shell of carrot cake
p46
aVice cream, I guess, and it comes off
p47
aVlooking like, you know,
p48
aVJupiter's floating around your plate.
p49
aa(lp50
VSo yeah, we're transforming things into
p51
aVsomething that you have absolutely
p52
aVno reference for.
p53
aVHC: And here's something we have no
p54
aVreference to eat. This is a cigar, and
p55
aVbasically it's a Cuban cigar made out of
p56
aVa Cuban pork sandwich, so we take these
p57
aVspices that go into the pork shoulder,
p58
aVwe fashion that into ash. We take
p59
aVthe sandwich and wrap it up in
p60
aVa collard green, put an edible label
p61
aVthat bears no similarity to
p62
aVa Cohiba cigar label, and we put it
p63
aVin a dollar ninety-nine ashtray and charge
p64
aVyou about twenty bucks for it. (Laughter)
p65
aVHC: Delicious.
p66
aa(lp67
VBR: That's not it, though.
p68
aVInstead of making foods that
p69
aVlook like things that you wouldn't eat,
p70
aVwe decided to make ingredients
p71
aVlook like dishes that you know.
p72
aVSo this is a plate of nachos.
p73
aVThe difference between our nachos
p74
aVand the other guy's nachos,
p75
aVis that this is actually a dessert.
p76
aVSo the chips are candied,
p77
aVthe ground beef is made from chocolate,
p78
aVand the cheese is made from a shredded
p79
aVmango sorbet that gets shredded
p80
aVinto liquid nitrogen to look like cheese.
p81
aVAnd after doing all of this
p82
aVdematerialization and reconfiguring
p83
aVof this, of these ingredients, we realized
p84
aVthat it was pretty cool,
p85
aVbecause as we served it, we learned that
p86
aVthe dish actually behaves like the real thing,
p87
aVwhere the cheese begins to melt.
p88
aVSo when you're looking at this thing
p89
aVin the dining room, you have this sensation
p90
aVthat this is actually a plate of nachos,
p91
aVand it's not really until you begin tasting it
p92
aVthat you realize this is a dessert, and
p93
aVit's just kind of like a mind-ripper.
p94
aV(Laughter)
p95
aa(lp96
VHC: So we had been creating
p97
aVall of these dishes out of a
p98
aVkitchen that was more like
p99
aVa mechanic's shop than a kitchen, and
p100
aVthe next logical step for us was to install
p101
aVa state-of-the-art laboratory,
p102
aVand that's what we have here.
p103
aVSo we put this in the basement, and we
p104
aVgot really serious about food, like
p105
aVserious experimentation.
p106
aVBR: One of the really cool things about
p107
aVthe lab, besides that we have a new
p108
aVscience lab in the kitchen, is that,
p109
aVyou know, with this new equipment, and
p110
aVthis new approach, all these
p111
aVdifferent doors to creativity that we never
p112
aVknew were there began to open, and so the
p113
aVexperiments and the food and the dishes
p114
aVthat we created, they just kept going
p115
aVfurther and further out there.
p116
aa(lp117
VHC: Let's talk about flavor transformation,
p118
aVand let's actually make some cool stuff.
p119
aVYou see a cow with its tongue hanging out.
p120
aVWhat I see is a cow about to eat something
p121
aVdelicious. What is that cow eating?
p122
aVAnd why is it delicious?
p123
aVSo the cow, basically, eats three basic
p124
aVthings in their feed: corn, beets, and barley,
p125
aVand so what I do is I actually
p126
aVchallenge my staff with these crazy,
p127
aVwild ideas. Can we take what the cow
p128
aVeats, remove the cow, and then make
p129
aVsome hamburgers out of that?
p130
aVAnd basically the reaction tends to be
p131
aVkind of like this. (Laughter)
p132
aVBR: Yeah, that's our chef de cuisine,
p133
aVChris Jones. This is not the only guy
p134
aVthat just flips out when we assign
p135
aVa ridiculous task, but a lot of these ideas,
p136
aVthey're hard to understand.
p137
aVThey're hard to just get automatically.
p138
aa(lp139
VThere's a lot of research and a lot of
p140
aVfailure, trial and error \u2014 I guess, more error \u2014
p141
aVthat goes into each and every dish,
p142
aVso we don't always get it right, and it takes
p143
aVa while for us to be able to explain that
p144
aVto people.
p145
aVHC: So, after about a day of Chris and I
p146
aVstaring at each other, we came up with
p147
aVsomething that was pretty close
p148
aVto the hamburger patty, and as you can
p149
aVsee it basically forms like hamburger meat.
p150
aVThis is made from three ingredients:
p151
aVbeets, barley, corn, and so it
p152
aVactually cooks up like hamburger meat,
p153
aVlooks and tastes like hamburger meat,
p154
aVand not only that, but it's basically
p155
aVremoving the cow from the equation.
p156
aVSo replicating food, taking it into that
p157
aVnext level is where we're going.
p158
aV(Applause)
p159
aa(lp160
VBR: And it's definitely the world's first
p161
aVbleeding veggie burger,
p162
aVwhich is a cool side effect.
p163
aVAnd a miracle berry, if you're not familiar
p164
aVwith it, is a natural ingredient, and it
p165
aVcontains a special property.
p166
aVIt's a glycoprotein called miraculin,
p167
aVa naturally occurring thing. It still freaks
p168
aVme out every time I eat it, but it has a
p169
aVunique ability to mask certain taste
p170
aVreceptors on your tongue, so that primarily
p171
aVsour taste receptors, so normally things
p172
aVthat would taste very sour or tart,
p173
aVsomehow begin to taste very sweet.
p174
aVHC: You're about to eat a lemon,
p175
aVand now it tastes like lemonade.
p176
aVLet's just stop and think about the
p177
aVeconomic benefits of something like that.
p178
aVWe could eliminate sugar across the board
p179
aVfor all confectionary products and sodas,
p180
aVand we can replace it with
p181
aVall-natural fresh fruit.
p182
aa(lp183
VBR: So you see us here cutting up
p184
aVsome watermelon. The idea with this
p185
aVis that we're going to eliminate tons of
p186
aVfood miles, wasted energy,
p187
aVand overfishing of tuna by creating tuna,
p188
aVor any exotic produce or item
p189
aVfrom a very far-away place,
p190
aVwith local, organic produce;
p191
aVso we have a watermelon from Wisconsin.
p192
aVHC: So if miracle berries take sour things
p193
aVand turn them into sweet things,
p194
aVwe have this other pixie dust
p195
aVthat we put on the watermelon, and it
p196
aVmakes it go from sweet to savory.
p197
aVSo after we do that, we put it into
p198
aVa vacuum bag, add a little bit of seaweed,
p199
aVsome spices, and we roll it, and this
p200
aVstarts taking on the appearance of tuna.
p201
aVSo the key now is to make it
p202
aVbehave like tuna.
p203
aVBR: And then after a quick dip into some
p204
aVliquid nitrogen to get that perfect sear,
p205
aVwe really have something that looks,
p206
aVtastes and behaves like the real thing.
p207
aa(lp208
VHC: So the key thing to remember here is,
p209
aVwe don't really care
p210
aVwhat this tuna really is.
p211
aVAs long as it's good for you and good for
p212
aVthe environment, it doesn't matter.
p213
aVBut where is this going?
p214
aVHow can we take this idea of tricking your
p215
aVtastebuds and leapfrog it into something
p216
aVthat we can do today that could be
p217
aVa disruptive food technology?
p218
aVSo here's the next challenge.
p219
aVI told the staff, let's just take a bunch
p220
aVof wild plants, think of them as
p221
aVfood ingredients. As long as they're
p222
aVnon-poisonous to the human body,
p223
aVgo out around Chicago sidewalks,
p224
aVtake it, blend it, cook it and then
p225
aVhave everybody flavor-trip on it at Moto.
p226
aVLet's charge them a boatload of cash for this
p227
aVand see what they think. (Laughter)
p228
aa(lp229
VBR: Yeah, so you can imagine, a task
p230
aVlike this \u2014 this is another one of those
p231
aVassignments that the kitchen staff
p232
aVhated us for. But we really had to almost
p233
aVrelearn how to cook in general,
p234
aVbecause these are ingredients, you know,
p235
aVplant life that we're, one, unfamiliar with,
p236
aVand two, we have no reference for how
p237
aVto cook these things because
p238
aVpeople don't eat them.
p239
aVSo we really had to think about new, creative ways
p240
aVto flavor, new ways to cook
p241
aVand to change texture \u2014 and that was
p242
aVthe main issue with this challenge.
p243
aa(lp244
VHC: So this is where we step into the future
p245
aVand we leapfrog ahead.
p246
aVSo developing nations
p247
aVand first-world nations,
p248
aVimagine if you could take these wild plants
p249
aVand consume them, food miles would
p250
aVbasically turn into food feet.
p251
aVThis disruptive mentality of what food is
p252
aVwould essentially open up the encyclopedia
p253
aVof what raw ingredients are, even if we just
p254
aVswapped out, say, one of these for flour,
p255
aVthat would eliminate so much energy
p256
aVand so much waste.
p257
aVAnd to give you a simple example here as to
p258
aVwhat we actually fed these customers,
p259
aVthere's a bale of hay there
p260
aVand some crab apples.
p261
aVAnd basically we took hay and crab apples
p262
aVand made barbecue sauce out of those two ingredients.
p263
aVPeople swore they were eating
p264
aVbarbecue sauce, and this is free food.
p265
