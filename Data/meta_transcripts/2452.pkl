VIn case you are wondering,
p4
aVno, I'm not wearing a dress,
p5
aVand no, I'm not saying what I'm wearing underneath.
p6
aa(lp7
V(Laughter)
p8
aa(lp9
VThis is a gho.
p10
aVThis is my national dress.
p11
aVThis is how all men dress in Bhutan.
p12
aVThat is how our women dress.
p13
aVLike our women,
p14
aVwe men get to wear pretty bright colors,
p15
aVbut unlike our women,
p16
aVwe get to show off our legs.
p17
aa(lp18
V(Laughter)
p19
aa(lp20
VOur national dress is unique,
p21
aVbut this is not the only thing that's unique about my country.
p22
aVOur promise to remain carbon neutral is also unique,
p23
aVand this is what I'd like to speak about today,
p24
aVour promise to remain carbon neutral.
p25
aa(lp26
VBut before I proceed, I should set you the context.
p27
aVI should tell you our story.
p28
aa(lp29
VBhutan is a small country in the Himalayas.
p30
aVWe've been called Shangri-La,
p31
aVeven the last Shangri-La.
p32
aVBut let me tell you right off the bat, we are not Shangri-La.
p33
aVMy country is not one big monastery
p34
aVpopulated with happy monks.
p35
aa(lp36
V(Laughter)
p37
aa(lp38
VThe reality is that there are barely 700,000 of us
p39
aVsandwiched between two of the most populated countries on earth,
p40
aVChina and India.
p41
aVThe reality is that we are a small, underdeveloped country
p42
aVdoing our best to survive.
p43
aVBut we are doing OK. We are surviving.
p44
aVIn fact, we are thriving,
p45
aVand the reason we are thriving is because we've been blessed
p46
aVwith extraordinary kings.
p47
aVOur enlightened monarchs have worked tirelessly
p48
aVto develop our country,
p49
aVbalancing economic growth carefully
p50
aVwith social development, environmental sustainability
p51
aVand cultural preservation,
p52
aVall within the framework of good governance.
p53
aVWe call this holistic approach to development
p54
aV"Gross National Happiness," or GNH.
p55
aVBack in the 1970s,
p56
aVour fourth king famously pronounced that for Bhutan,
p57
aVGross National Happiness is more important than Gross National Product.
p58
aa(lp59
V(Applause)
p60
aa(lp61
VEver since,
p62
aVall development in Bhutan is driven by GNH,
p63
aVa pioneering vision that aims to improve the happiness
p64
aVand well-being of our people.
p65
aa(lp66
VBut that's easier said than done,
p67
aVespecially when you are one of the smallest economies in the world.
p68
aVOur entire GDP is less than two billion dollars.
p69
aVI know that some of you here are worth more \u2014
p70
aa(lp71
V(Laughter)
p72
aa(lp73
Vindividually
p74
aVthan the entire economy of my country.
p75
aa(lp76
VSo our economy is small,
p77
aVbut here is where it gets interesting.
p78
aVEducation is completely free.
p79
aVAll citizens are guaranteed free school education,
p80
aVand those that work hard are given free college education.
p81
aVHealthcare is also completely free.
p82
aVMedical consultation, medical treatment, medicines:
p83
aVthey are all provided by the state.
p84
aVWe manage this
p85
aVbecause we use our limited resources very carefully,
p86
aVand because we stay faithful to the core mission of GNH,
p87
aVwhich is development with values.
p88
aVOur economy is small, and we must strengthen it.
p89
aVEconomic growth is important,
p90
aVbut that economic growth must not come from undermining our unique culture
p91
aVor our pristine environment.
p92
aa(lp93
VToday, our culture is flourishing.
p94
aVWe continue to celebrate our art and architecture,
p95
aVfood and festivals,
p96
aVmonks and monasteries.
p97
aVAnd yes, we celebrate our national dress, too.
p98
aVThis is why I can wear my gho with pride.
p99
aVHere's a fun fact:
p100
aVyou're looking at the world's biggest pocket.
p101
aa(lp102
V(Laughter)
p103
aa(lp104
VIt starts here,
p105
aVgoes around the back,
p106
aVand comes out from inside here.
p107
aVIn this pocket
p108
aVwe store all manner of personal goods
p109
aVfrom phones and wallets
p110
aVto iPads, office files and books.
p111
aa(lp112
V(Laughter)
p113
aa(lp114
V(Applause)
p115
aa(lp116
VBut sometimes \u2014
p117
aVsometimes even precious cargo.
p118
aa(lp119
VSo our culture is flourishing,
p120
aVbut so is our environment.
p121
aV72 percent of my country is under forest cover.
p122
aVOur constitution demands that a minimum of 60 percent
p123
aVof Bhutan's total land shall remain under forest cover
p124
aVfor all time.
p125
aa(lp126
V(Applause)
p127
aa(lp128
VOur constitution,
p129
aVthis constitution,
p130
aVimposes forest cover on us.
p131
aVIncidentally, our king used this constitution
p132
aVto impose democracy on us.
p133
aVYou see, we the people didn't want democracy.
p134
aVWe didn't ask for it, we didn't demand it,
p135
aVand we certainly didn't fight for it.
p136
aVInstead, our king imposed democracy on us
p137
aVby insisting that he include it in the constitution.
p138
aVBut he went further.
p139
aVHe included provisions in the constitution
p140
aVthat empower the people to impeach their kings,
p141
aVand included provisions in here that require all our kings to retire
p142
aVat the age of 65.
p143
aa(lp144
V(Applause)
p145
aa(lp146
VFact is, we already have a king in retirement:
p147
aVour previous king, the Great Fourth,
p148
aVretired 10 years ago
p149
aVat the peak of his popularity.
p150
aVHe was all of 51 years at that time.
p151
aa(lp152
VSo as I was saying,
p153
aV72 percent of our country is under forest cover,
p154
aVand all that forest is pristine.
p155
aVThat's why we are one of the few remaining
p156
aVglobal biodiversity hotspots in the world,
p157
aVand that's why we are a carbon neutral country.
p158
aVIn a world that is threatened with climate change,
p159
aVwe are a carbon neutral country.
p160
aa(lp161
VTurns out, it's a big deal.
p162
aVOf the 200-odd countries in the world today,
p163
aVit looks like we are the only one
p164
aVthat's carbon neutral.
p165
aVActually, that's not quite accurate.
p166
aVBhutan is not carbon neutral.
p167
aVBhutan is carbon negative.
p168
aVOur entire country generates 2.2 million tons of carbon dioxide,
p169
aVbut our forests, they sequester more than three times that amount,
p170
aVso we are a net carbon sink
p171
aVfor more than four million tons of carbon dioxide each year.
p172
aVBut that's not all.
p173
aa(lp174
V(Applause)
p175
aa(lp176
VWe export most of the renewable electricity
p177
aVwe generate from our fast-flowing rivers.
p178
aVSo today, the clean energy that we export
p179
aVoffsets about six million tons of carbon dioxide in our neighborhood.
p180
aVBy 2020, we'll be exporting enough electricity
p181
aVto offset 17 million tons of carbon dioxide.
p182
aVAnd if we were to harness even half our hydropower potential,
p183
aVand that's exactly what we are working at,
p184
aVthe clean, green energy that we export
p185
aVwould offset something like 50 million tons of carbon dioxide a year.
p186
aVThat is more CO2 than what the entire city of New York generates in one year.
p187
aa(lp188
VSo inside our country, we are a net carbon sink.
p189
aVOutside, we are offsetting carbon.
p190
aVAnd this is important stuff.
p191
aVYou see, the world is getting warmer,
p192
aVand climate change is a reality.
p193
aVClimate change is affecting my country.
p194
aVOur glaciers are melting,
p195
aVcausing flash floods and landslides,
p196
aVwhich in turn are causing disaster and widespread destruction in our country.
p197
aVI was at that lake recently.
p198
aVIt's stunning.
p199
aVThat's how it looked 10 years ago,
p200
aVand that's how it looked 20 years ago.
p201
aVJust 20 years ago, that lake didn't exist.
p202
aVIt was a solid glacier.
p203
aVA few years ago, a similar lake
p204
aVbreached its dams
p205
aVand wreaked havoc in the valleys below.
p206
aVThat destruction was caused by one glacier lake.
p207
aVWe have 2,700 of them to contend with.
p208
aVThe point is this:
p209
aVmy country and my people have done nothing
p210
aVto contribute to global warming,
p211
aVbut we are already bearing the brunt of its consequences.
p212
aVAnd for a small, poor country, one that is landlocked and mountainous,
p213
aVit is very difficult.
p214
aVBut we are not going to sit on our hands doing nothing.
p215
aVWe will fight climate change.
p216
aVThat's why we have promised to remain carbon neutral.
p217
aa(lp218
VWe first made this promise in 2009
p219
aVduring COP 15 in Copenhagen,
p220
aVbut nobody noticed.
p221
aVGovernments were so busy arguing with one another
p222
aVand blaming each other for causing climate change,
p223
aVthat when a small country raised our hands and announced,
p224
aV"We promise to remain carbon neutral for all time,"
p225
aVnobody heard us.
p226
aVNobody cared.
p227
aa(lp228
VLast December in Paris,
p229
aVat COP 21, we reiterated our promise
p230
aVto remain carbon neutral for all time to come.
p231
aVThis time, we were heard.
p232
aVWe were noticed, and everybody cared.
p233
aVWhat was different in Paris was that governments came round together
p234
aVto accept the realities of climate change,
p235
aVand were willing to come together and act together and work together.
p236
aVAll countries, from the very small to the very large,
p237
aVcommitted to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions.
p238
aVThe UN Framework Convention on Climate Change
p239
aVsays that if these so-called intended commitments are kept,
p240
aVwe'd be closer to containing global warming
p241
aVby two degrees Celsius.
p242
aa(lp243
VBy the way,
p244
aVI've requested the TED organizers here
p245
aVto turn up the heat in here by two degrees,
p246
aVso if some of you are feeling warmer than usual,
p247
aVyou know who to blame.
p248
aa(lp249
VIt's crucial that all of us keep our commitments.
p250
aVAs far as Bhutan is concerned,
p251
aVwe will keep our promise to remain carbon neutral.
p252
aVHere are some of the ways we are doing it.
p253
aVWe are providing free electricity to our rural farmers.
p254
aVThe idea is that, with free electricity, they will no longer have to use firewood
p255
aVto cook their food.
p256
aVWe are investing in sustainable transport
p257
aVand subsidizing the purchase of electric vehicles.
p258
aVSimilarly, we are subsidizing the cost of LED lights,
p259
aVand our entire government is trying to go paperless.
p260
aVWe are cleaning up our entire country through Clean Bhutan, a national program,
p261
aVand we are planting trees throughout our country
p262
aVthrough Green Bhutan,
p263
aVanother national program.
p264
aa(lp265
VBut it is our protected areas
p266
aVthat are at the core of our carbon neutral strategy.
p267
aVOur protected areas are our carbon sink.
p268
aVThey are our lungs.
p269
aVToday, more than half our country is protected,
p270
aVas national parks, nature reserves
p271
aVand wildlife sanctuaries.
p272
aVBut the beauty is that we've connected them all with one another
p273
aVthrough a network of biological corridors.
p274
aVNow, what this means
p275
aVis that our animals are free to roam throughout our country.
p276
aVTake this tiger, for example.
p277
aVIt was spotted at 250 meters above sea level
p278
aVin the hot, subtropical jungles.
p279
aVTwo years later, that same tiger
p280
aVwas spotted near 4,000 meters
p281
aVin our cold alpine mountains.
p282
aVIsn't that awesome?
p283
aa(lp284
V(Applause)
p285
aa(lp286
VWe must keep it that way.
p287
aVWe must keep our parks awesome.
p288
aVSo every year, we set aside resources to prevent poaching, hunting,
p289
aVmining and pollution in our parks,
p290
aVand resources to help communities who live in those parks
p291
aVmanage their forests,
p292
aVadapt to climate change,
p293
aVand lead better lives while continuing to live in harmony with Mother Nature.
p294
aa(lp295
VBut that is expensive.
p296
aVOver the next few years, our small economy won't have the resources
p297
aVto cover all the costs that are required to protect our environment.
p298
aVIn fact, when we run the numbers,
p299
aVit looks like it'll take us at least 15 years
p300
aVbefore we can fully finance all our conservation efforts.
p301
aVBut neither Bhutan,
p302
aVnor the world
p303
aVcan afford to spend 15 years going backwards.
p304
aa(lp305
VThis is why His Majesty the King
p306
aVstarted Bhutan For Life.
p307
aVBhutan For Life gives us the time we need.
p308
aVIt gives us breathing room.
p309
aVIt is essentially a funding mechanism
p310
aVto look after our parks,
p311
aVto protect our parks,
p312
aVuntil our government can take over on our own fully.
p313
aVThe idea is to raise a transition fund
p314
aVfrom individual donors, corporations and institutions,
p315
aVbut the deal is closed only after predetermined conditions are met
p316
aVand all funds committed.
p317
aVSo multiparty, single closing:
p318
aVan idea we borrowed from Wall Street.
p319
aVThis means that individual donors can commit without having to worry
p320
aVthat they'll be left supporting an underfunded plan.
p321
aVIt's something like a Kickstarter project,
p322
aVonly with a 15-year time horizon
p323
aVand millions of tons of carbon dioxide at stake.
p324
aVOnce the deal is closed,
p325
aVwe use the transition fund to protect our parks,
p326
aVgiving our government time to increase our own funding gradually
p327
aVuntil the end of the 15-year period.
p328
aVAfter that, our government guarantees full funding forever.
p329
aa(lp330
VWe are almost there.
p331
aVWe expect to close later this year.
p332
aVNaturally, I'm pretty excited.
p333
aa(lp334
V(Applause)
p335
aa(lp336
VThe World Wildlife Fund is our principle partner in this journey,
p337
aVand I want to give them a big shoutout
p338
aVfor the excellent work they are doing in Bhutan
p339
aVand across the world.
p340
aa(lp341
V(Applause)
p342
aa(lp343
VWhew, it is getting warm in here.
p344
aa(lp345
VI thank you for listening to our story,
p346
aVa story of how we are keeping our promise to remain carbon neutral,
p347
aVa story of how we are keeping our country pristine,
p348
aVfor ourselves, our children,
p349
aVfor your children and for the world.
p350
aVBut we are not here to tell stories, are we?
p351
aVWe are here to dream together.
p352
aVSo in closing, I'd like to share one more dream that I have.
p353
aVWhat if we could mobilize our leadership and our resources,
p354
aVour influence and our passion,
p355
aVto replicate the Bhutan For Life idea to other countries
p356
aVso that they too
p357
aVcan conserve their protected areas for all time.
p358
aVAfter all, there are many other countries who face the same issues that we face.
p359
aVThey too have natural resources
p360
aVthat can help win the world's fight for sustainability,
p361
aVonly they may not have the ability to invest in them now.
p362
aVSo what if we set up Earth For Life,
p363
aVa global fund, to kickstart the Bhutan For Life throughout the world?
p364
aVI invite you to help me,
p365
aVto carry this dream beyond our borders
p366
aVto all those who care about our planet's future.
p367
aVAfter all, we're here to dream together,
p368
aVto work together,
p369
aVto fight climate change together, to protect our planet together.
p370
aVBecause the reality is
p371
aVwe are in it together.
p372
aVSome of us might dress differently,
p373
aVbut we are in it together.
p374
aa(lp375
VThank you very much,
