VWell, it's great to be here.
p4
aVWe've heard a lot about the promise of technology, and the peril.
p5
aVI've been quite interested in both.
p6
aVIf we could convert 0.03 percent
p7
aVof the sunlight that falls on the earth into energy,
p8
aVwe could meet all of our projected needs for 2030.
p9
aVWe can't do that today because solar panels are heavy,
p10
aVexpensive and very inefficient.
p11
aVThere are nano-engineered designs,
p12
aVwhich at least have been analyzed theoretically,
p13
aVthat show the potential to be very lightweight,
p14
aVvery inexpensive, very efficient,
p15
aVand we'd be able to actually provide all of our energy needs in this renewable way.
p16
aVNano-engineered fuel cells
p17
aVcould provide the energy where it's needed.
p18
aVThat's a key trend, which is decentralization,
p19
aVmoving from centralized nuclear power plants and
p20
aVliquid natural gas tankers
p21
aVto decentralized resources that are environmentally more friendly,
p22
aVa lot more efficient
p23
aVand capable and safe from disruption.
p24
aa(lp25
VBono spoke very eloquently,
p26
aVthat we have the tools, for the first time,
p27
aVto address age-old problems of disease and poverty.
p28
aVMost regions of the world are moving in that direction.
p29
aVIn 1990, in East Asia and the Pacific region,
p30
aVthere were 500 million people living in poverty \u2014
p31
aVthat number now is under 200 million.
p32
aVThe World Bank projects by 2011, it will be under 20 million,
p33
aVwhich is a reduction of 95 percent.
p34
aVI did enjoy Bono's comment
p35
aVlinking Haight-Ashbury to Silicon Valley.
p36
aVBeing from the Massachusetts high-tech community myself,
p37
aVI'd point out that we were hippies also in the 1960s,
p38
aValthough we hung around Harvard Square.
p39
aVBut we do have the potential to overcome disease and poverty,
p40
aVand I'm going to talk about those issues, if we have the will.
p41
aa(lp42
VKevin Kelly talked about the acceleration of technology.
p43
aVThat's been a strong interest of mine,
p44
aVand a theme that I've developed for some 30 years.
p45
aVI realized that my technologies had to make sense when I finished a project.
p46
aVThat invariably, the world was a different place
p47
aVwhen I would introduce a technology.
p48
aVAnd, I noticed that most inventions fail,
p49
aVnot because the R&D department can't get it to work \u2014
p50
aVif you look at most business plans, they will actually succeed
p51
aVif given the opportunity to build what they say they're going to build \u2014
p52
aVand 90 percent of those projects or more will fail, because the timing is wrong \u2014
p53
aVnot all the enabling factors will be in place when they're needed.
p54
aa(lp55
VSo I began to be an ardent student of technology trends,
p56
aVand track where technology would be at different points in time,
p57
aVand began to build the mathematical models of that.
p58
aVIt's kind of taken on a life of its own.
p59
aVI've got a group of 10 people that work with me to gather data
p60
aVon key measures of technology in many different areas, and we build models.
p61
aVAnd you'll hear people say, well, we can't predict the future.
p62
aVAnd if you ask me,
p63
aVwill the price of Google be higher or lower than it is today three years from now,
p64
aVthat's very hard to say.
p65
aVWill WiMax CDMA G3
p66
aVbe the wireless standard three years from now? That's hard to say.
p67
aVBut if you ask me, what will it cost
p68
aVfor one MIPS of computing in 2010,
p69
aVor the cost to sequence a base pair of DNA in 2012,
p70
aVor the cost of sending a megabyte of data wirelessly in 2014,
p71
aVit turns out that those are very predictable.
p72
aa(lp73
VThere are remarkably smooth exponential curves
p74
aVthat govern price performance, capacity, bandwidth.
p75
aVAnd I'm going to show you a small sample of this,
p76
aVbut there's really a theoretical reason
p77
aVwhy technology develops in an exponential fashion.
p78
aVAnd a lot of people, when they think about the future, think about it linearly.
p79
aVThey think they're going to continue
p80
aVto develop a problem
p81
aVor address a problem using today's tools,
p82
aVat today's pace of progress,
p83
aVand fail to take into consideration this exponential growth.
p84
aa(lp85
VThe Genome Project was a controversial project in 1990.
p86
aVWe had our best Ph.D. students,
p87
aVour most advanced equipment around the world,
p88
aVwe got 1/10,000th of the project done,
p89
aVso how're we going to get this done in 15 years?
p90
aVAnd 10 years into the project,
p91
aVthe skeptics were still going strong \u2014 says, "You're two-thirds through this project,
p92
aVand you've managed to only sequence
p93
aVa very tiny percentage of the whole genome."
p94
aVBut it's the nature of exponential growth
p95
aVthat once it reaches the knee of the curve, it explodes.
p96
aVMost of the project was done in the last
p97
aVfew years of the project.
p98
aVIt took us 15 years to sequence HIV \u2014
p99
aVwe sequenced SARS in 31 days.
p100
aVSo we are gaining the potential to overcome these problems.
p101
aa(lp102
VI'm going to show you just a few examples
p103
aVof how pervasive this phenomena is.
p104
aVThe actual paradigm-shift rate, the rate of adopting new ideas,
p105
aVis doubling every decade, according to our models.
p106
aVThese are all logarithmic graphs,
p107
aVso as you go up the levels it represents, generally multiplying by factor of 10 or 100.
p108
aVIt took us half a century to adopt the telephone,
p109
aVthe first virtual-reality technology.
p110
aVCell phones were adopted in about eight years.
p111
aVIf you put different communication technologies
p112
aVon this logarithmic graph,
p113
aVtelevision, radio, telephone
p114
aVwere adopted in decades.
p115
aVRecent technologies \u2014 like the PC, the web, cell phones \u2014
p116
aVwere under a decade.
p117
aVNow this is an interesting chart,
p118
aVand this really gets at the fundamental reason why
p119
aVan evolutionary process \u2014 and both biology and technology are evolutionary processes \u2014
p120
aVaccelerate.
p121
aVThey work through interaction \u2014 they create a capability,
p122
aVand then it uses that capability to bring on the next stage.
p123
aa(lp124
VSo the first step in biological evolution,
p125
aVthe evolution of DNA \u2014 actually it was RNA came first \u2014
p126
aVtook billions of years,
p127
aVbut then evolution used that information-processing backbone
p128
aVto bring on the next stage.
p129
aVSo the Cambrian Explosion, when all the body plans of the animals were evolved,
p130
aVtook only 10 million years. It was 200 times faster.
p131
aVAnd then evolution used those body plans
p132
aVto evolve higher cognitive functions,
p133
aVand biological evolution kept accelerating.
p134
aVIt's an inherent nature of an evolutionary process.
p135
aVSo Homo sapiens, the first technology-creating species,
p136
aVthe species that combined a cognitive function
p137
aVwith an opposable appendage \u2014
p138
aVand by the way, chimpanzees don't really have a very good opposable thumb \u2014
p139
aVso we could actually manipulate our environment with a power grip
p140
aVand fine motor coordination,
p141
aVand use our mental models to actually change the world
p142
aVand bring on technology.
p143
aa(lp144
VBut anyway, the evolution of our species took hundreds of thousands of years,
p145
aVand then working through interaction,
p146
aVevolution used, essentially,
p147
aVthe technology-creating species to bring on the next stage,
p148
aVwhich were the first steps in technological evolution.
p149
aVAnd the first step took tens of thousands of years \u2014
p150
aVstone tools, fire, the wheel \u2014 kept accelerating.
p151
aVWe always used then the latest generation of technology
p152
aVto create the next generation.
p153
aVPrinting press took a century to be adopted;
p154
aVthe first computers were designed pen-on-paper \u2014 now we use computers.
p155
aVAnd we've had a continual acceleration of this process.
p156
aa(lp157
VNow by the way, if you look at this on a linear graph, it looks like everything has just happened,
p158
aVbut some observer says, "Well, Kurzweil just put points on this graph
p159
aVthat fall on that straight line."
p160
aVSo, I took 15 different lists from key thinkers,
p161
aVlike the Encyclopedia Britannica, the Museum of Natural History, Carl Sagan's Cosmic Calendar
p162
aVon the same \u2014 and these people were not trying to make my point;
p163
aVthese were just lists in reference works,
p164
aVand I think that's what they thought the key events were
p165
aVin biological evolution and technological evolution.
p166
aVAnd again, it forms the same straight line. You have a little bit of thickening in the line
p167
aVbecause people do have disagreements, what the key points are,
p168
aVthere's differences of opinion when agriculture started,
p169
aVor how long the Cambrian Explosion took.
p170
aVBut you see a very clear trend.
p171
aVThere's a basic, profound acceleration of this evolutionary process.
p172
aVInformation technologies double their capacity, price performance, bandwidth,
p173
aVevery year.
p174
aVAnd that's a very profound explosion of exponential growth.
p175
aVA personal experience, when I was at MIT \u2014
p176
aVcomputer taking up about the size of this room,
p177
aVless powerful than the computer in your cell phone.
p178
aVBut Moore's Law, which is very often identified with this exponential growth,
p179
aVis just one example of many, because it's basically
p180
aVa property of the evolutionary process of technology.
p181
aa(lp182
VI put 49 famous computers on this logarithmic graph \u2014
p183
aVby the way, a straight line on a logarithmic graph is exponential growth \u2014
p184
aVthat's another exponential.
p185
aVIt took us three years to double our price performance of computing in 1900,
p186
aVtwo years in the middle; we're now doubling it every one year.
p187
aVAnd that's exponential growth through five different paradigms.
p188
aVMoore's Law was just the last part of that,
p189
aVwhere we were shrinking transistors on an integrated circuit,
p190
aVbut we had electro-mechanical calculators,
p191
aVrelay-based computers that cracked the German Enigma Code,
p192
aVvacuum tubes in the 1950s predicted the election of Eisenhower,
p193
aVdiscreet transistors used in the first space flights
p194
aVand then Moore's Law.
p195
aVEvery time one paradigm ran out of steam,
p196
aVanother paradigm came out of left field to continue the exponential growth.
p197
aVThey were shrinking vacuum tubes, making them smaller and smaller.
p198
aVThat hit a wall. They couldn't shrink them and keep the vacuum.
p199
aVWhole different paradigm \u2014 transistors came out of the woodwork.
p200
aVIn fact, when we see the end of the line for a particular paradigm,
p201
aVit creates research pressure to create the next paradigm.
p202
aVAnd because we've been predicting the end of Moore's Law
p203
aVfor quite a long time \u2014 the first prediction said 2002, until now it says 2022.
p204
aVBut by the teen years,
p205
aVthe features of transistors will be a few atoms in width,
p206
aVand we won't be able to shrink them any more.
p207
aVThat'll be the end of Moore's Law, but it won't be the end of
p208
aVthe exponential growth of computing, because chips are flat.
p209
aVWe live in a three-dimensional world; we might as well use the third dimension.
p210
aVWe will go into the third dimension
p211
aVand there's been tremendous progress, just in the last few years,
p212
aVof getting three-dimensional, self-organizing molecular circuits to work.
p213
aVWe'll have those ready well before Moore's Law runs out of steam.
p214
aVSupercomputers \u2014 same thing.
p215
aVProcessor performance on Intel chips,
p216
aVthe average price of a transistor \u2014
p217
aV1968, you could buy one transistor for a dollar.
p218
aVYou could buy 10 million in 2002.
p219
aa(lp220
VIt's pretty remarkable how smooth
p221
aVan exponential process that is.
p222
aVI mean, you'd think this is the result of some tabletop experiment,
p223
aVbut this is the result of worldwide chaotic behavior \u2014
p224
aVcountries accusing each other of dumping products,
p225
aVIPOs, bankruptcies, marketing programs.
p226
aVYou would think it would be a very erratic process,
p227
aVand you have a very smooth
p228
aVoutcome of this chaotic process.
p229
aVJust as we can't predict
p230
aVwhat one molecule in a gas will do \u2014
p231
aVit's hopeless to predict a single molecule \u2014
p232
aVyet we can predict the properties of the whole gas,
p233
aVusing thermodynamics, very accurately.
p234
aVIt's the same thing here. We can't predict any particular project,
p235
aVbut the result of this whole worldwide,
p236
aVchaotic, unpredictable activity of competition
p237
aVand the evolutionary process of technology is very predictable.
p238
aVAnd we can predict these trends far into the future.
p239
aVUnlike Gertrude Stein's roses,
p240
aVit's not the case that a transistor is a transistor.
p241
aVAs we make them smaller and less expensive,
p242
aVthe electrons have less distance to travel.
p243
aVThey're faster, so you've got exponential growth in the speed of transistors,
p244
aVso the cost of a cycle of one transistor
p245
aVhas been coming down with a halving rate of 1.1 years.
p246
aVYou add other forms of innovation and processor design,
p247
aVyou get a doubling of price performance of computing every one year.
p248
aa(lp249
VAnd that's basically deflation \u2014
p250
aV50 percent deflation.
p251
aVAnd it's not just computers. I mean, it's true of DNA sequencing;
p252
aVit's true of brain scanning;
p253
aVit's true of the World Wide Web. I mean, anything that we can quantify,
p254
aVwe have hundreds of different measurements
p255
aVof different, information-related measurements \u2014
p256
aVcapacity, adoption rates \u2014
p257
aVand they basically double every 12, 13, 15 months,
p258
aVdepending on what you're looking at.
p259
aVIn terms of price performance, that's a 40 to 50 percent deflation rate.
p260
aVAnd economists have actually started worrying about that.
p261
aVWe had deflation during the Depression,
p262
aVbut that was collapse of the money supply,
p263
aVcollapse of consumer confidence, a completely different phenomena.
p264
aVThis is due to greater productivity,
p265
aVbut the economist says, "But there's no way you're going to be able to keep up with that.
p266
aVIf you have 50 percent deflation, people may increase their volume
p267
aV30, 40 percent, but they won't keep up with it."
p268
aVBut what we're actually seeing is that
p269
aVwe actually more than keep up with it.
p270
aVWe've had 28 percent per year compounded growth in dollars
p271
aVin information technology over the last 50 years.
p272
aVI mean, people didn't build iPods for 10,000 dollars 10 years ago.
p273
aVAs the price performance makes new applications feasible,
p274
aVnew applications come to the market.
p275
aVAnd this is a very widespread phenomena.
p276
aVMagnetic data storage \u2014
p277
aVthat's not Moore's Law, it's shrinking magnetic spots,
p278
aVdifferent engineers, different companies, same exponential process.
p279
aa(lp280
VA key revolution is that we're understanding our own biology
p281
aVin these information terms.
p282
aVWe're understanding the software programs
p283
aVthat make our body run.
p284
aVThese were evolved in very different times \u2014
p285
aVwe'd like to actually change those programs.
p286
aVOne little software program, called the fat insulin receptor gene,
p287
aVbasically says, "Hold onto every calorie,
p288
aVbecause the next hunting season may not work out so well."
p289
aVThat was in the interests of the species tens of thousands of years ago.
p290
aVWe'd like to actually turn that program off.
p291
aVThey tried that in animals, and these mice ate ravenously
p292
aVand remained slim and got the health benefits of being slim.
p293
aVThey didn't get diabetes; they didn't get heart disease;
p294
aVthey lived 20 percent longer; they got the health benefits of caloric restriction
p295
aVwithout the restriction.
p296
aVFour or five pharmaceutical companies have noticed this,
p297
aVfelt that would be
p298
aVinteresting drug for the human market,
p299
aVand that's just one of the 30,000 genes
p300
aVthat affect our biochemistry.
p301
aa(lp302
VWe were evolved in an era where it wasn't in the interests of people
p303
aVat the age of most people at this conference, like myself,
p304
aVto live much longer, because we were using up the precious resources
p305
aVwhich were better deployed towards the children
p306
aVand those caring for them.
p307
aVSo, life \u2014 long lifespans \u2014
p308
aVlike, that is to say, much more than 30 \u2014
p309
aVweren't selected for,
p310
aVbut we are learning to actually manipulate
p311
aVand change these software programs
p312
aVthrough the biotechnology revolution.
p313
aVFor example, we can inhibit genes now with RNA interference.
p314
aVThere are exciting new forms of gene therapy
p315
aVthat overcome the problem of placing the genetic material
p316
aVin the right place on the chromosome.
p317
aVThere's actually a \u2014 for the first time now,
p318
aVsomething going to human trials, that actually cures pulmonary hypertension \u2014
p319
aVa fatal disease \u2014 using gene therapy.
p320
aVSo we'll have not just designer babies, but designer baby boomers.
p321
aVAnd this technology is also accelerating.
p322
aVIt cost 10 dollars per base pair in 1990,
p323
aVthen a penny in 2000.
p324
aVIt's now under a 10th of a cent.
p325
aVThe amount of genetic data \u2014
p326
aVbasically this shows that smooth exponential growth
p327
aVdoubled every year,
p328
aVenabling the genome project to be completed.
p329
aa(lp330
VAnother major revolution: the communications revolution.
p331
aVThe price performance, bandwidth, capacity of communications measured many different ways;
p332
aVwired, wireless is growing exponentially.
p333
aVThe Internet has been doubling in power and continues to,
p334
aVmeasured many different ways.
p335
aVThis is based on the number of hosts.
p336
aa(lp337
VMiniaturization \u2014 we're shrinking the size of technology
p338
aVat an exponential rate,
p339
aVboth wired and wireless.
p340
aVThese are some designs from Eric Drexler's book \u2014
p341
aVwhich we're now showing are feasible
p342
aVwith super-computing simulations,
p343
aVwhere actually there are scientists building
p344
aVmolecule-scale robots.
p345
aVOne has one that actually walks with a surprisingly human-like gait,
p346
aVthat's built out of molecules.
p347
aVThere are little machines doing things in experimental bases.
p348
aVThe most exciting opportunity
p349
aVis actually to go inside the human body
p350
aVand perform therapeutic and diagnostic functions.
p351
aVAnd this is less futuristic than it may sound.
p352
aVThese things have already been done in animals.
p353
aa(lp354
VThere's one nano-engineered device that cures type 1 diabetes. It's blood cell-sized.
p355
aVThey put tens of thousands of these
p356
aVin the blood cell \u2014 they tried this in rats \u2014
p357
aVit lets insulin out in a controlled fashion,
p358
aVand actually cures type 1 diabetes.
p359
aVWhat you're watching is a design
p360
aVof a robotic red blood cell,
p361
aVand it does bring up the issue that our biology
p362
aVis actually very sub-optimal,
p363
aVeven though it's remarkable in its intricacy.
p364
aVOnce we understand its principles of operation,
p365
aVand the pace with which we are reverse-engineering biology is accelerating,
p366
aVwe can actually design these things to be
p367
aVthousands of times more capable.
p368
aVAn analysis of this respirocyte, designed by Rob Freitas,
p369
aVindicates if you replace 10 percent of your red blood cells with these robotic versions,
p370
aVyou could do an Olympic sprint for 15 minutes without taking a breath.
p371
aVYou could sit at the bottom of your pool for four hours \u2014
p372
aVso, "Honey, I'm in the pool," will take on a whole new meaning.
p373
aVIt will be interesting to see what we do in our Olympic trials.
p374
aVPresumably we'll ban them,
p375
aVbut then we'll have the specter of teenagers in their high schools gyms
p376
aVroutinely out-performing the Olympic athletes.
p377
aVFreitas has a design for a robotic white blood cell.
p378
aVThese are 2020-circa scenarios,
p379
aVbut they're not as futuristic as it may sound.
p380
aVThere are four major conferences on building blood cell-sized devices;
p381
aVthere are many experiments in animals.
p382
aVThere's actually one going into human trial,
p383
aVso this is feasible technology.
p384
aa(lp385
VIf we come back to our exponential growth of computing,
p386
aV1,000 dollars of computing is now somewhere between an insect and a mouse brain.
p387
aVIt will intersect human intelligence
p388
aVin terms of capacity in the 2020s,
p389
aVbut that'll be the hardware side of the equation.
p390
aVWhere will we get the software?
p391
aVWell, it turns out we can see inside the human brain,
p392
aVand in fact not surprisingly,
p393
aVthe spatial and temporal resolution of brain scanning is doubling every year.
p394
aVAnd with the new generation of scanning tools,
p395
aVfor the first time we can actually see
p396
aVindividual inter-neural fibers
p397
aVand see them processing and signaling in real time \u2014
p398
aVbut then the question is, OK, we can get this data now,
p399
aVbut can we understand it?
p400
aVDoug Hofstadter wonders, well, maybe our intelligence
p401
aVjust isn't great enough to understand our intelligence,
p402
aVand if we were smarter, well, then our brains would be that much more complicated,
p403
aVand we'd never catch up to it.
p404
aVIt turns out that we can understand it.
p405
aa(lp406
VThis is a block diagram of
p407
aVa model and simulation of the human auditory cortex

aVthat actually works quite well \u2014
p409
aVin applying psychoacoustic tests, gets very similar results to human auditory perception.
p410
aVThere's another simulation of the cerebellum \u2014
p411
aVthat's more than half the neurons in the brain \u2014
p412
aVagain, works very similarly to human skill formation.
p413
aVThis is at an early stage, but you can show
p414
aVwith the exponential growth of the amount of information about the brain
p415
aVand the exponential improvement
p416
aVin the resolution of brain scanning,
p417
aVwe will succeed in reverse-engineering the human brain
p418
aVby the 2020s.
p419
aVWe've already had very good models and simulation of about 15 regions
p420
aVout of the several hundred.
p421
aa(lp422
VAll of this is driving
p423
aVexponentially growing economic progress.
p424
aVWe've had productivity go from 30 dollars to 150 dollars per hour
p425
aVof labor in the last 50 years.
p426
aVE-commerce has been growing exponentially. It's now a trillion dollars.
p427
aVYou might wonder, well, wasn't there a boom and a bust?
p428
aVThat was strictly a capital-markets phenomena.
p429
aVWall Street noticed that this was a revolutionary technology, which it was,
p430
aVbut then six months later, when it hadn't revolutionized all business models,
p431
aVthey figured, well, that was wrong,
p432
aVand then we had this bust.
p433
aa(lp434
VAll right, this is a technology
p435
aVthat we put together using some of the technologies we're involved in.
p436
aVThis will be a routine feature in a cell phone.
p437
aVIt would be able to translate from one language to another.
p438
aa(lp439
VSo let me just end with a couple of scenarios.
p440
aVBy 2010 computers will disappear.
p441
aVThey'll be so small, they'll be embedded in our clothing, in our environment.
p442
aVImages will be written directly to our retina,
p443
aVproviding full-immersion virtual reality,
p444
aVaugmented real reality. We'll be interacting with virtual personalities.
p445
aa(lp446
VBut if we go to 2029, we really have the full maturity of these trends,
p447
aVand you have to appreciate how many turns of the screw
p448
aVin terms of generations of technology, which are getting faster and faster, we'll have at that point.
p449
aVI mean, we will have two-to-the-25th-power
p450
aVgreater price performance, capacity and bandwidth
p451
aVof these technologies, which is pretty phenomenal.
p452
aVIt'll be millions of times more powerful than it is today.
p453
aVWe'll have completed the reverse-engineering of the human brain,
p454
aV1,000 dollars of computing will be far more powerful
p455
aVthan the human brain in terms of basic raw capacity.
p456
aVComputers will combine
p457
aVthe subtle pan-recognition powers
p458
aVof human intelligence with ways in which machines are already superior,
p459
aVin terms of doing analytic thinking,
p460
aVremembering billions of facts accurately.
p461
aVMachines can share their knowledge very quickly.
p462
aVBut it's not just an alien invasion of intelligent machines.
p463
aVWe are going to merge with our technology.
p464
aa(lp465
VThese nano-bots I mentioned
p466
aVwill first be used for medical and health applications:
p467
aVcleaning up the environment, providing powerful fuel cells
p468
aVand widely distributed decentralized solar panels and so on in the environment.
p469
aVBut they'll also go inside our brain,
p470
aVinteract with our biological neurons.
p471
aVWe've demonstrated the key principles of being able to do this.
p472
aVSo, for example,
p473
aVfull-immersion virtual reality from within the nervous system,
p474
aVthe nano-bots shut down the signals coming from your real senses,
p475
aVreplace them with the signals that your brain would be receiving
p476
aVif you were in the virtual environment,
p477
aVand then it'll feel like you're in that virtual environment.
p478
aVYou can go there with other people, have any kind of experience
p479
aVwith anyone involving all of the senses.
p480
aV"Experience beamers," I call them, will put their whole flow of sensory experiences
p481
aVin the neurological correlates of their emotions out on the Internet.
p482
aVYou can plug in and experience what it's like to be someone else.
p483
aVBut most importantly,
p484
aVit'll be a tremendous expansion
p485
aVof human intelligence through this direct merger with our technology,
p486
aVwhich in some sense we're doing already.
p487
aVWe routinely do intellectual feats
p488
aVthat would be impossible without our technology.
p489
aVHuman life expectancy is expanding. It was 37 in 1800,
p490
aVand with this sort of biotechnology, nano-technology revolutions,
p491
aVthis will move up very rapidly
p492
aVin the years ahead.
p493
aa(lp494
VMy main message is that progress in technology
p495
aVis exponential, not linear.
p496
aVMany \u2014 even scientists \u2014 assume a linear model,
p497
aVso they'll say, "Oh, it'll be hundreds of years
p498
aVbefore we have self-replicating nano-technology assembly
p499
aVor artificial intelligence."
p500
aVIf you really look at the power of exponential growth,
p501
aVyou'll see that these things are pretty soon at hand.
p502
aVAnd information technology is increasingly encompassing
p503
aVall of our lives, from our music to our manufacturing
p504
aVto our biology to our energy to materials.
p505
aa(lp506
VWe'll be able to manufacture almost anything we need in the 2020s,
p507
aVfrom information, in very inexpensive raw materials,
p508
aVusing nano-technology.
p509
aVThese are very powerful technologies.
p510
aVThey both empower our promise and our peril.
p511
aVSo we have to have the will to apply them to the right problems.
