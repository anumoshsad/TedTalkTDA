VThis is my first trip,
p4
aVmy first foreign trip as a first lady.
p5
aVCan you believe that?
p6
aV(Applause)
p7
aVAnd while this is not my first visit to the U.K.,
p8
aVI have to say that I am glad that this is my first official visit.
p9
aVThe special relationship between the United States and the U.K.
p10
aVis based not only on the relationship between governments,
p11
aVbut the common language and the values that we share,
p12
aVand I'm reminded of that by watching you all today.
p13
aVDuring my visit I've been especially honored
p14
aVto meet some of Britain's most extraordinary women \u2014
p15
aVwomen who are paving the way for all of you.
p16
aa(lp17
VAnd I'm honored to meet you,
p18
aVthe future leaders of Great Britain and this world.
p19
aVAnd although the circumstances of our lives may seem very distant,
p20
aVwith me standing here as the First Lady of the United States of America,
p21
aVand you, just getting through school,
p22
aVI want you to know that we have very much in common.
p23
aVFor nothing in my life's path
p24
aVwould have predicted that I'd be standing here
p25
aVas the first African-American First Lady
p26
aVof the United States of America.
p27
aVThere is nothing in my story that would land me here.
p28
aVI wasn't raised with wealth or resources
p29
aVor any social standing to speak of.
p30
aVI was raised on the South Side of Chicago.
p31
aVThat's the real part of Chicago.
p32
aVAnd I was the product of a working-class community.
p33
aVMy father was a city worker all of his life,
p34
aVand my mother was a stay-at-home mom.
p35
aVAnd she stayed at home to take care of me and my older brother.
p36
aVNeither of them attended university.
p37
aVMy dad was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis
p38
aVin the prime of his life.
p39
aVBut even as it got harder for him to walk
p40
aVand get dressed in the morning \u2014
p41
aVI saw him struggle more and more \u2014
p42
aVmy father never complained about his struggle.
p43
aVHe was grateful for what he had.
p44
aVHe just woke up a little earlier and worked a little harder.
p45
aVAnd my brother and I were raised with all that you really need:
p46
aVlove, strong values
p47
aVand a belief that with a good education
p48
aVand a whole lot of hard work,
p49
aVthat there was nothing that we could not do.
p50
aa(lp51
VI am an example of what's possible
p52
aVwhen girls from the very beginning of their lives
p53
aVare loved and nurtured by the people around them.
p54
aVI was surrounded by extraordinary women in my life:
p55
aVgrandmothers, teachers, aunts, cousins, neighbors,
p56
aVwho taught me about quiet strength and dignity.
p57
aVAnd my mother, the most important role model in my life,
p58
aVwho lives with us at the White House
p59
aVand helps to care for our two little daughters,
p60
aVMalia and Sasha.
p61
aVShe's an active presence in their lives, as well as mine,
p62
aVand is instilling in them
p63
aVthe same values that she taught me and my brother:
p64
aVthings like compassion, and integrity,
p65
aVand confidence, and perseverance \u2014
p66
aVall of that wrapped up in an unconditional love
p67
aVthat only a grandmother can give.
p68
aa(lp69
VI was also fortunate enough to be cherished and encouraged
p70
aVby some strong male role models as well,
p71
aVincluding my father, my brother, uncles and grandfathers.
p72
aVThe men in my life taught me some important things, as well.
p73
aVThey taught me about what a respectful relationship
p74
aVshould look like between men and women.
p75
aVThey taught me about what a strong marriage feels like:
p76
aVthat it's built on faith and commitment
p77
aVand an admiration for each other's unique gifts.
p78
aVThey taught me about what it means
p79
aVto be a father
p80
aVand to raise a family.
p81
aVAnd not only to invest in your own home
p82
aVbut to reach out and help raise kids
p83
aVin the broader community.
p84
aa(lp85
VAnd these were the same qualities
p86
aVthat I looked for in my own husband,
p87
aVBarack Obama.
p88
aVAnd when we first met,
p89
aVone of the things that I remember is that he took me out on a date.
p90
aVAnd his date was to go with him to a community meeting.
p91
aV(Laughter)
p92
aVI know, how romantic.
p93
aV(Laughter)
p94
aVBut when we met, Barack was a community organizer.
p95
aVHe worked, helping people to find jobs
p96
aVand to try to bring resources into struggling neighborhoods.
p97
aVAs he talked to the residents in that community center,
p98
aVhe talked about two concepts.
p99
aVHe talked about "the world as it is" and "the world as it should be."
p100
aVAnd I talked about this throughout the entire campaign.
p101
aVWhat he said, that all too often,
p102
aVis that we accept the distance between those two ideas.
p103
aVAnd sometimes we settle for the world as it is,
p104
aVeven when it doesn't reflect our values and aspirations.
p105
aVBut Barack reminded us on that day,
p106
aVall of us in that room, that we all know
p107
aVwhat our world should look like.
p108
aVWe know what fairness and justice and opportunity look like.
p109
aVWe all know.
p110
aVAnd he urged the people in that meeting,
p111
aVin that community,
p112
aVto devote themselves to closing the gap
p113
aVbetween those two ideas,
p114
aVto work together to try to make the world as it is
p115
aVand the world as it should be, one and the same.
p116
aa(lp117
VAnd I think about that today because I am
p118
aVreminded and convinced that all of you in this school
p119
aVare very important parts of closing that gap.
p120
aVYou are the women who will build the world as it should be.
p121
aVYou're going to write the next chapter in history.
p122
aVNot just for yourselves, but for your generation
p123
aVand generations to come.
p124
aVAnd that's why getting a good education
p125
aVis so important.
p126
aVThat's why all of this that you're going through \u2014
p127
aVthe ups and the downs, the teachers that you love and the teachers that you don't \u2014
p128
aVwhy it's so important.
p129
aVBecause communities and countries and ultimately the world
p130
aVare only as strong as the health of their women.
p131
aVAnd that's important to keep in mind.
p132
aa(lp133
VPart of that health includes an outstanding education.
p134
aVThe difference between a struggling family and a healthy one
p135
aVis often the presence of an empowered woman
p136
aVor women at the center of that family.
p137
aVThe difference between a broken community and a thriving one
p138
aVis often the healthy respect between men and women
p139
aVwho appreciate the contributions each other makes to society.
p140
aVThe difference between a languishing nation
p141
aVand one that will flourish
p142
aVis the recognition that we need equal access to education
p143
aVfor both boys and girls.
p144
aa(lp145
VAnd this school, named after the U.K.'s first female doctor,
p146
aVand the surrounding buildings named for Mexican artist Frida Kahlo,
p147
aVMary Seacole,
p148
aVthe Jamaican nurse known as the "black Florence Nightingale,"
p149
aVand the English author, Emily Bronte,
p150
aVhonor women who fought sexism, racism and ignorance,
p151
aVto pursue their passions to feed their own souls.
p152
aVThey allowed for no obstacles.
p153
aVAs the sign said back there, "without limitations."
p154
aVThey knew no other way to live
p155
aVthan to follow their dreams.
p156
aVAnd having done so, these women
p157
aVmoved many obstacles.
p158
aVAnd they opened many new doors
p159
aVfor millions of female doctors and nurses
p160
aVand artists and authors,
p161
aVall of whom have followed them.
p162
aVAnd by getting a good education,
p163
aVyou too can control your own destiny.
p164
aa(lp165
VPlease remember that.
p166
aVIf you want to know the reason why I'm standing here,
p167
aVit's because of education.
p168
aVI never cut class. Sorry, I don't know if anybody is cutting class.
p169
aVI never did it.
p170
aVI loved getting As.
p171
aVI liked being smart.
p172
aVI liked being on time. I liked getting my work done.
p173
aVI thought being smart was cooler than anything in the world.
p174
aVAnd you too, with these same values,
p175
aVcan control your own destiny.
p176
aVYou too can pave the way.
p177
aVYou too can realize your dreams,
p178
aVand then your job is to reach back
p179
aVand to help someone just like you do the same thing.
p180
aVHistory proves that it doesn't matter
p181
aVwhether you come from a council estate
p182
aVor a country estate.
p183
aa(lp184
VYour success will be determined
p185
aVby your own fortitude,
p186
aVyour own confidence, your own individual hard work.
p187
aVThat is true. That is the reality of the world that we live in.
p188
aVYou now have control over your own destiny.
p189
aVAnd it won't be easy \u2014 that's for sure.
p190
aVBut you have everything you need.
p191
aVEverything you need to succeed,
p192
aVyou already have, right here.
p193
aa(lp194
VMy husband works in this big office.
p195
aVThey call it the Oval Office.
p196
aVIn the White House, there's the desk that he sits at \u2014
p197
aVit's called the Resolute desk.
p198
aVIt was built by the timber of Her Majesty's Ship Resolute
p199
aVand given by Queen Victoria.
p200
aVIt's an enduring symbol of the friendship between our two nations.
p201
aVAnd its name, Resolute,
p202
aVis a reminder of the strength of character that's required
p203
aVnot only to lead a country,
p204
aVbut to live a life of purpose, as well.
p205
aVAnd I hope in pursuing your dreams, you all remain resolute,
p206
aVthat you go forward without limits,
p207
aVand that you use your talents \u2014 because there are many; we've seen them;
p208
aVit's there \u2014
p209
aVthat you use them to create the world as it should be.
p210
aVBecause we are counting on you.
p211
aVWe are counting on every single one of you
p212
aVto be the very best that you can be.
p213
aVBecause the world is big.
p214
aVAnd it's full of challenges.
p215
aVAnd we need strong, smart, confident young women
p216
aVto stand up and take the reins.
p217
aa(lp218
VWe know you can do it. We love you. Thank you so much.
