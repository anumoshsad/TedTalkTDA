VI was born and raised in Dakar, Senegal,
p4
aVand through a combination of accidents and cosmic justice,
p5
aVbecame a chef in the US.
p6
aa(lp7
V(Laughter)
p8
aa(lp9
VWhen I first arrived in New York,
p10
aVI began working in these restaurants \u2014 different types of restaurants \u2014
p11
aVfrom French bistro to Italian,
p12
aVglobal ethnic to modern American.
p13
aVAt the time,
p14
aVNew York was already well-established as a food capital of the world.
p15
aVHowever ...
p16
aVwith the exception of a few West African and Ethiopian mom-and-pop eateries,
p17
aVthere was no such thing as African cuisine in the entire city.
p18
aa(lp19
VEarly in my life,
p20
aVI was influenced by Senegal's first president,
p21
aVLéopold Sédar Senghor,
p22
aVnicknamed, "the poet president,"
p23
aVwho talked about a new humanism,
p24
aVa universal civilization,
p25
aVin which all cultures would come together around a communal table as equals,
p26
aVeach bringing its own beautiful contribution to share.
p27
aVHe called it "the rendezvous of giving and receiving."
p28
aVThat concept resonated with me,
p29
aVand it has guided my career path.
p30
aa(lp31
VAfter years of working in restaurants,
p32
aVI yearned for my work to have a deeper impact
p33
aVthat would go beyond the last meal I had served.
p34
aVI wanted to give back, both to New York \u2014
p35
aVthe city that allowed me the opportunity to follow my calling \u2014
p36
aVbut also to my origins and ancestors in Senegal.
p37
aVI wanted to contribute to that universal civilization
p38
aVSenghor had described.
p39
aVBut I didn't know how to make a measurable impact
p40
aVas a cook and writer.
p41
aa(lp42
VWhile I was writing my first cookbook,
p43
aVI often traveled to different regions of Senegal for research.
p44
aVDuring one of those trips,
p45
aVin the remote, southeast region of Kédougou
p46
aVI rediscovered an ancient grain called fonio
p47
aVthat had all but disappeared from the urban Senegalese diet.
p48
aVIt turns out that fonio had been cultivated
p49
aVfor more than five thousand years
p50
aVand is probably the oldest cultivated cereal in Africa.
p51
aVOnce a popular grain on much of the continent,
p52
aVfonio was grown all the way to ancient Egypt,
p53
aVwhere archaeologists found grains inside pyramids' burial grounds.
p54
aVToday it is mostly cultivated in the western part of the Sahel region,
p55
aVfrom Senegal to Mali,
p56
aVBurkina Faso,
p57
aVTogo, Nigeria.
p58
aVThe Sahel region is that semiarid area south of the Sahara desert
p59
aVthat extends from the Atlantic in the west to the Red Sea in the east.
p60
aVI became more interested in this grain
p61
aVthat was deemed worth taking to the afterlife by early Egyptians.
p62
aa(lp63
VAs I continued my research,
p64
aVI found out that fonio was actually \u2014
p65
aVwherever it was cultivated \u2014
p66
aVthere was always some myth, or some superstition connected to it.
p67
aVThe Dogon,
p68
aVanother great culture in Mali,
p69
aVcalled it "po,"
p70
aVor, "the seed of the universe."
p71
aVIn that ancient culture's mythology,
p72
aVthe entire universe sprouted from a seed of fonio.
p73
aa(lp74
VAside from its purported mystical properties,
p75
aVfonio is a miracle grain in many aspects.
p76
aVIt is nutritious,
p77
aVparticularly rich in methionine and cysteine,
p78
aVtwo amino acids that are deficient in most other major grains:
p79
aVbarley, rice or wheat to name a few.
p80
aVIn addition,
p81
aVfonio cultivation is great for the environment.
p82
aVIt tolerates poor soil
p83
aVand needs very little water,
p84
aVsurviving where nothing else will grow.
p85
aa(lp86
VAs a chef,
p87
aVwhat first struck me was its delicate taste and its versatility.
p88
aVSimilar to couscous,
p89
aVfonio has a delicious, nutty and earthy flavor.
p90
aVIt can be turned into salad,
p91
aVserved as noodles,
p92
aVused in baking
p93
aVor simply as a substitute for any other grains in your favorite recipes.
p94
aVI am happy to share some of my fonio sushi and sweet potato sushi
p95
aVwith some of you right now.
p96
aa(lp97
V(Audience) Oh!
p98
aa(lp99
V(Applause)
p100

VAnd okra.

aa(lp103
V(Audience murmurs)
p104
aa(lp105
VIn Kédougou
p106
aVit is also nicknamed "ñamu buur,"
p107
aVwhich means "food for royalty,"
p108
aVand it's served for guests of honor.
p109
aa(lp110
VLocated at the border with Guinea and Mali,
p111
aVKédougou first strikes visitors with its stunning vistas
p112
aVand views of the Fouta Djallon Mountains.
p113
aVSadly, it is also one of the poorest regions of Senegal.
p114
aVBecause of desertification and lack of job prospects,
p115
aVmuch of Kédougou's young population has left.
p116
aVThey chose the deadly path of migration
p117
aVin search of "better" opportunities.
p118
aVOften,
p119
aVthey risk their lives trying to reach Europe.
p120
aVSome leave by crossing the Sahara desert.
p121
aVOthers end up on inadequate wooden canoes
p122
aVin desperate attempts to reach Spain.
p123
aVAccording to a recent "Guardian" article,
p124
aVby 2020 more that 60 million people from sub-Saharan Africa
p125
aVare expected to migrate
p126
aVdue to desertification.
p127
aVThis is the biggest global wave of migration since the Second World War,
p128
aVand it's only set to grow.
p129
aVSo far this year,
p130
aVmore that 2,100 migrants have lost their lives
p131
aVon their way to Europe.
p132
aVThis is the reality of Kédougou
p133
aVand of much of the Sahel today.
p134
aVScary future,
p135
aVscarce food
p136
aVand no opportunities to change their situation.
p137
aa(lp138
VIf life in your village weren't so precarious,
p139
aVif there was a way to having enough food to get by,
p140
aVor having a paying job \u2014
p141
aVif you and your sisters
p142
aVdidn't have to spend 30 percent of their waking hours
p143
aVfetching water,
p144
aVif conditions were just a little more hospitable ...
p145
aVcould the solution be right here in our soil?
p146
aVCould bringing fonio to the rest of the world
p147
aVbe the answer?
p148
aa(lp149
VAncient grains are getting more popular,
p150
aVand sales of gluten-free items are growing in the US \u2014
p151
aV16.4 percent since 2013,
p152
aVmaking it a 23.3-billion-dollar industry.
p153
aVHow could fonio partake in this market share?
p154
aa(lp155
VThere are many challenges in turning fonio into food.
p156
aVTraditional processing is laborious and time-consuming,
p157
aVespecially when compared to other grains.
p158
aVWell, thankfully, technology has evolved.
p159
aVAnd there are now machines
p160
aVthat can process fonio in a more efficient way.
p161
aVAnd as a matter of fact,
p162
aVa few years ago,
p163
aVSanoussi Diakité,
p164
aVa Senegalese engineer,
p165
aVwon a Rolex prize
p166
aVfor his invention of the first mechanized fonio processor.
p167
aVToday, such machines are making life much easier for producers
p168
aVaround the whole Sahel region.
p169
aa(lp170
VAnother challenge is the colonial mentality
p171
aVthat what comes from the west is best.
p172
aVThis tendency to look down on our own products
p173
aVand to see crops like fonio as simply "country peoples' food,"
p174
aVtherefore substandard,
p175
aVexplains why even though we don't produce wheat in Senegal traditionally,
p176
aVit is far easier to find baguettes or croissants in the streets of Dakar
p177
aVthan it is to find any fonio products.
p178
aVThis same mindset popularized the overprocessed, leftover rice debris
p179
aVknown as "broken rice,"
p180
aVwhich was imported to Senegal from Indochina
p181
aVand introduced by the colonial French.
p182
aVSoon, broken rice became a key ingredient in our national dish,
p183
aVthiéboudienne,
p184
aVreplacing our own traditional, more nutritious African rice,
p185
aVOryza glaberrima.
p186
aVIronically, the same African rice despised at home
p187
aVwas hailed abroad.
p188
aVIndeed, during the Atlantic slave trade,
p189
aVthis rice became a major crop in the Americas ...
p190
aVparticularly in the Carolinas
p191
aVwhere it was nicknamed, "Carolina gold."
p192
aa(lp193
VBut let's return to fonio.
p194
aVHow can we turn its current status of "country-people food"
p195
aVinto a world-class crop?
p196
aVLast year,
p197
aVa business partner and I secured a commitment from Whole Foods Market,
p198
aVthe US's largest natural food store chain,
p199
aVto carry fonio.
p200
aVAnd we got a large American ingredient importer
p201
aVinterested enough to send a team of executives
p202
aVto West Africa with us
p203
aVto explore the supply chain's viability.
p204
aVWe found ourselves observing manual operations
p205
aVin remote locations
p206
aVwith few controls over quality.
p207
aVSo we started focusing on processing issues.
p208
aVWe drew up a vision
p209
aVwith a beneficial and commercially sustainable supply chain for fonio,
p210
aVand we connected ourselves with organizations
p211
aVthat can help us achieve it.
p212
aa(lp213
VWalking backwards from the market, here is what it looks like.
p214
aVImagine that fonio is consumed all across the globe
p215
aVas other popular ancient grains.
p216
aVFonio touted on the levels of cereals,
p217
aVbreads,
p218
aVnutrition bars,
p219
aVcookies, pastas,
p220
aVsnacks \u2014 why not?
p221
aVIt's easier to say than quinoa.
p222
aa(lp223
V(Laughter)
p224
aa(lp225
V(Applause)
p226
aa(lp227
VTo get there,
p228
aVfonio needs to be readily available
p229
aVat a consistent quality for commercial users,
p230
aVsuch as food manufacturers and restaurant chains.
p231
aVThat's the part we're missing.
p232
aVTo make fonio available at a consistent quality
p233
aVfor commercial use,
p234
aVyou need a commercial-scale fonio mill
p235
aVthat adheres to international quality standards.
p236
aVCurrently, there is no such mill in the whole world,
p237
aVso in our vision,
p238
aVthere is an African-owned and operated fonio mill
p239
aVthat processes efficiently
p240
aVand in compliance with the requirements of multinational food companies.
p241
aVIt is very difficult for the fonio producers today
p242
aVto sell and use fonio
p243
aVunless they devote a huge amount of time and energy
p244
aVin threshing, winnowing and husking it.
p245
aVIn our vision,
p246
aVthe mill will take on those tasks,
p247
aVallowing the producers to focus on farming rather than processing.
p248
aa(lp249
VThere is untapped agricultural capacity in the Sahel,
p250
aVand all it takes is changing market conditions
p251
aVto activate that capacity.
p252
aVBy relieving fonio producers of manual operations,
p253
aVthe mill will free up their time
p254
aVand remove the production bottleneck that limits their output.
p255
aVAnd there are other benefits as well
p256
aVin using Sahel land for agriculture.
p257
aVMore benefits,
p258
aVhigher employment,
p259
aVclimate change mitigation by reversing desertification
p260
aVand greater food security.
p261
aVNice vision, right?
p262
aVWell, we are working towards getting it done.
p263
aVLast month we introduced fonio to shoppers in New York City
p264
aVand online,
p265
aVin a package that makes it attractive and desirable and accessible.
p266
aa(lp267
V(Applause)
p268
aa(lp269
VWe are talking with operators and investors in West Africa
p270
aVabout building a fonio mill.
p271
aVAnd most importantly,
p272
aVwe have teamed with an NGO called SOS SAHEL
p273
aVto recruit, train and equip smallholders in the Sahel
p274
aVto increase their fonio production.
p275
aa(lp276
VHunger levels are higher in sub-Saharan Africa
p277
aVthan any other place in the world.
p278
aVThe Sahel population is set to grow
p279
aVfrom 135 million to 340 million people.
p280
aVHowever, in that drought- and famine-prone region,
p281
aVfonio grows freely.
p282
aVThis tiny grain may provide big answers,
p283
aVreasserting its Dogon name,
p284
aV"po," the seed of the universe,
p285
aVand taking us one step closer
p286
aVto the universal civilization.
p287
aa(lp288
