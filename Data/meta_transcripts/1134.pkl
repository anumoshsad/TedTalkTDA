VSo for the past year and a half,
p4
aVmy team at Push Pop Press
p5
aVand Charlie Melcher and Melcher Media
p6
aVhave been working on creating
p7
aVthe first feature-length interactive book.
p8
aVIt's called "Our Choice"
p9
aVand the author is Al Gore.
p10
aVIt's the sequel to "An Inconvenient Truth,"
p11
aVand it explores all the solutions
p12
aVthat will solve the climate crisis.
p13
aa(lp14
VThe book starts like this. This is the cover.
p15
aVAs the globe spins,
p16
aVwe can see our location,
p17
aVand we can open the book
p18
aVand swipe through the chapters
p19
aVto browse the book.
p20
aVOr, we can scroll through the pages at the bottom.
p21
aVAnd if we wanted to zoom into a page,
p22
aVwe can just open it up.
p23
aVAnd anything you see in the book,
p24
aVyou can pick up with two fingers
p25
aVand lift off the page
p26
aVand open up.
p27
aVAnd if you want to go back
p28
aVand read the book again,
p29
aVyou just fold it back up and put it back on the page.
p30
aVAnd so this works the same way; you pick it up and pop it open.
p31
aa(lp32
V(Audio) Al Gore: I consider myself
p33
aVamong the majority
p34
aVwho look at windmills and feel
p35
aVthey're a beautiful addition to the landscape.
p36
aa(lp37
VMike Matas: And so throughout the whole book,
p38
aVAl Gore will walk you through and explain the photos.
p39
aVThis photo, you can you can even see on an interactive map.
p40
aVZoom into it and see where it was taken.
p41
aVAnd throughout the book,
p42
aVthere's over an hour of documentary footage
p43
aVand interactive animations.
p44
aVSo you can open this one.
p45
aa(lp46
V(Audio) AG: Most modern wind turbines consist of a large ...
p47
aa(lp48
VMM: It starts playing immediately.
p49
aVAnd while it's playing, we can pinch and peak back at the page,
p50
aVand the movie keeps playing.
p51
aVOr we can zoom out to the table of contents,
p52
aVand the video keeps playing.
p53
aVBut one of the coolest things in this book
p54
aVare the interactive infographics.
p55
aVThis one shows the wind potential
p56
aVall around the United States.
p57
aVBut instead of just showing us the information,
p58
aVwe can take our finger and explore,
p59
aVand see, state by state,
p60
aVexactly how much wind potential there is.
p61
aVWe can do the same for geothermal energy
p62
aVand solar power.
p63
aa(lp64
VThis is one of my favorites.
p65
aVSo this shows ...
p66
aV(Laughter)
p67
aV(Applause)
p68
aVWhen the wind is blowing,
p69
aVany excess energy coming from the windmill
p70
aVis diverted into the battery.
p71
aVAnd as the wind starts dying down,
p72
aVany excess energy will be diverted back into the house \u2014
p73
aVthe lights never go out.
p74
aVAnd this whole book, it doesn't just run on the iPad.
p75
aVIt also runs on the iPhone.
p76
aVAnd so you can start reading on your iPad in your living room
p77
aVand then pick up where you left off on the iPhone.
p78
aVAnd it works the exact same way.
p79
aVYou can pinch into any page.
p80
aVOpen it up.
p81
aa(lp82
VSo that's Push Pop Press' first title,
p83
aVAl Gore's "Our Choice."

aV(Applause)
p86
aa(lp87
VChris Anderson: That's spectacular.
p88
aVDo you want to be a publisher,
p89
aVa technology licenser?
p90
aVWhat is the business here?
p91
aVIs this something that other people can do?
p92
aa(lp93
VMM: Yeah, we're building a tool
p94
aVthat makes it really easy for publishers right now to build this content.
p95
aVSo Melcher Media's team, who's on the East coast \u2014
p96
aVand we're on the West coast, building the software \u2014
p97
aVtakes our tool
p98
aVand, every day, drags in images and text.
p99
aa(lp100
