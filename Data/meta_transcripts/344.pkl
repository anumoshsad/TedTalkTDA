VSo, a big question that we're facing now
p4
aVand have been for quite a number of years now:
p5
aVare we at risk of a nuclear attack?
p6
aVNow, there's a bigger question
p7
aVthat's probably actually more important than that,
p8
aVis the notion of permanently eliminating
p9
aVthe possibility of a nuclear attack,
p10
aVeliminating the threat altogether.
p11
aVAnd I would like to make a case to you that
p12
aVover the years since we first developed atomic weaponry,
p13
aVuntil this very moment,
p14
aVwe've actually lived in a dangerous nuclear world
p15
aVthat's characterized by two phases,
p16
aVwhich I'm going to go through with you right now.
p17
aa(lp18
VFirst of all, we started off the nuclear age in 1945.
p19
aVThe United States had developed a couple of atomic weapons
p20
aVthrough the Manhattan Project,
p21
aVand the idea was very straightforward:
p22
aVwe would use the power of the atom
p23
aVto end the atrocities and the horror
p24
aVof this unending World War II
p25
aVthat we'd been involved in in Europe and in the Pacific.
p26
aVAnd in 1945,
p27
aVwe were the only nuclear power.
p28
aVWe had a few nuclear weapons,
p29
aVtwo of which we dropped on Japan, in Hiroshima,
p30
aVa few days later in Nagasaki, in August 1945,
p31
aVkilling about 250,000 people between those two.
p32
aa(lp33
VAnd for a few years,
p34
aVwe were the only nuclear power on Earth.
p35
aVBut by 1949, the Soviet Union had decided
p36
aVit was unacceptable to have us as the only nuclear power,
p37
aVand they began to match what the United States had developed.
p38
aVAnd from 1949 to 1985
p39
aVwas an extraordinary time
p40
aVof a buildup of a nuclear arsenal
p41
aVthat no one could possibly have imagined
p42
aVback in the 1940s.
p43
aVSo by 1985 \u2014 each of those red bombs up here
p44
aVis equivalent of a thousands warheads \u2014
p45
aVthe world had
p46
aV65,000 nuclear warheads,
p47
aVand seven members of something
p48
aVthat came to be known as the "nuclear club."
p49
aa(lp50
VAnd it was an extraordinary time,
p51
aVand I am going to go through some of the mentality
p52
aVthat we \u2014 that Americans and the rest of the world were experiencing.
p53
aVBut I want to just point out to you that 95 percent
p54
aVof the nuclear weapons at any particular time
p55
aVsince 1985 \u2014 going forward, of course \u2014
p56
aVwere part of the arsenals
p57
aVof the United States and the Soviet Union.
p58
aVAfter 1985, and before the break up of the Soviet Union,
p59
aVwe began to disarm
p60
aVfrom a nuclear point of view.
p61
aVWe began to counter-proliferate,
p62
aVand we dropped the number of nuclear warheads in the world
p63
aVto about a total of 21,000.
p64
aVIt's a very difficult number to deal with,
p65
aVbecause what we've done is
p66
aVwe've quote unquote "decommissioned" some of the warheads.
p67
aVThey're still probably usable. They could be "re-commissioned,"
p68
aVbut the way they count things, which is very complicated,
p69
aVwe think we have about a third
p70
aVof the nuclear weapons we had before.
p71
aVBut we also, in that period of time,
p72
aVadded two more members to the nuclear club:
p73
aVPakistan and North Korea.
p74
aa(lp75
VSo we stand today with a still fully armed nuclear arsenal
p76
aVamong many countries around the world,
p77
aVbut a very different set of circumstances.
p78
aVSo I'm going to talk about
p79
aVa nuclear threat story in two chapters.
p80
aVChapter one is 1949 to 1991,
p81
aVwhen the Soviet Union broke up,
p82
aVand what we were dealing with, at that point and through those years,
p83
aVwas a superpowers' nuclear arms race.
p84
aVIt was characterized by
p85
aVa nation-versus-nation,
p86
aVvery fragile standoff.
p87
aVAnd basically,
p88
aVwe lived for all those years,
p89
aVand some might argue that we still do,
p90
aVin a situation of
p91
aVbeing on the brink, literally,
p92
aVof an apocalyptic, planetary calamity.
p93
aVIt's incredible that we actually lived through all that.
p94
aa(lp95
VWe were totally dependent during those years
p96
aVon this amazing acronym, which is MAD.
p97
aVIt stands for mutually assured destruction.
p98
aVSo it meant
p99
aVif you attacked us, we would attack you
p100
aVvirtually simultaneously,
p101
aVand the end result would be a destruction
p102
aVof your country and mine.
p103
aVSo the threat of my own destruction
p104
aVkept me from launching
p105
aVa nuclear attack on you. That's the way we lived.
p106
aVAnd the danger of that, of course, is that
p107
aVa misreading of a radar screen
p108
aVcould actually cause a counter-launch,
p109
aVeven though the first country had not actually launched anything.
p110
aVDuring this chapter one,
p111
aVthere was a high level of public awareness
p112
aVabout the potential of nuclear catastrophe,
p113
aVand an indelible image was implanted
p114
aVin our collective minds
p115
aVthat, in fact, a nuclear holocaust
p116
aVwould be absolutely globally destructive
p117
aVand could, in some ways, mean the end of civilization as we know it.
p118
aVSo this was chapter one.
p119
aa(lp120
VNow the odd thing is that even though
p121
aVwe knew that there would be
p122
aVthat kind of civilization obliteration,
p123
aVwe engaged in America in a series \u2014
p124
aVand in fact, in the Soviet Union \u2014
p125
aVin a series of response planning.
p126
aVIt was absolutely incredible.
p127
aVSo premise one is we'd be destroying the world,
p128
aVand then premise two is, why don't we get prepared for it?
p129
aVSo what
p130
aVwe offered ourselves
p131
aVwas a collection of things. I'm just going to go skim through a few things,
p132
aVjust to jog your memories.
p133
aVIf you're born after 1950, this is just \u2014
p134
aVconsider this entertainment, otherwise it's memory lane.
p135
aa(lp136
VThis was Bert the Turtle. (Video)
p137
aVThis was basically an attempt
p138
aVto teach our schoolchildren
p139
aVthat if we did get engaged
p140
aVin a nuclear confrontation and atomic war,
p141
aVthen we wanted our school children
p142
aVto kind of basically duck and cover.
p143
aVThat was the principle. You \u2014
p144
aVthere would be a nuclear conflagration
p145
aVabout to hit us, and if you get under your desk,
p146
aVthings would be OK.
p147
aa(lp148
V(Laughter)
p149
aa(lp150
VI didn't do all that well
p151
aVin psychiatry in medical school, but I was interested,
p152
aVand I think this was seriously delusional.
p153
aa(lp154
V(Laughter)
p155
aa(lp156
VSecondly, we told people
p157
aVto go down in their basements
p158
aVand build a fallout shelter.
p159
aVMaybe it would be a study when we weren't having an atomic war,
p160
aVor you could use it as a TV room, or, as many teenagers found out,
p161
aVa very, very safe place for a little privacy with your girlfriend.
p162
aVAnd actually \u2014 so there are multiple uses of the bomb shelters.
p163
aVOr you could buy a prefabricated bomb shelter
p164
aVthat you could simply bury in the ground.
p165
aVNow, the bomb shelters at that point \u2014
p166
aVlet's say you bought a prefab one \u2014 it would be a few hundred dollars,
p167
aVmaybe up to 500, if you got a fancy one.
p168
aVYet, what percentage of Americans
p169
aVdo you think ever had a bomb shelter in their house?
p170
aVWhat percentage lived in a house with a bomb shelter?
p171
aa(lp172
VLess than two percent. About 1.4 percent
p173
aVof the population, as far as anyone knows,
p174
aVdid anything,
p175
aVeither making a space in their basement
p176
aVor actually building a bomb shelter.
p177
aVMany buildings, public buildings, around the country \u2014
p178
aVthis is New York City \u2014 had these little civil defense signs,
p179
aVand the idea was that you would
p180
aVrun into one of these shelters and be safe
p181
aVfrom the nuclear weaponry.
p182
aVAnd one of the greatest governmental delusions
p183
aVof all time was something that happened
p184
aVin the early days of
p185
aVthe Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, as we now know,
p186
aVand are well aware of their behaviors from Katrina.
p187
aVHere is their first big public
p188
aVannouncement.
p189
aVThey would propose \u2014
p190
aVactually there were about six volumes written on this \u2014
p191
aVa crisis relocation plan
p192
aVthat was dependent upon
p193
aVthe United States having three to four days warning
p194
aVthat the Soviets were going to attack us.
p195
aVSo the goal was to evacuate the target cities.
p196
aVWe would move people out of the target cities
p197
aVinto the countryside.
p198
aa(lp199
VAnd I'm telling you, I actually testified at the Senate
p200
aVabout the absolute ludicrous idea
p201
aVthat we would actually evacuate,
p202
aVand actually have three or four days' warning.
p203
aVIt was just completely off the wall.
p204
aVTurns out that they had another idea
p205
aVbehind it, even though this was \u2014
p206
aVthey were telling the public it was to save us.
p207
aVThe idea was that we would force the Soviets
p208
aVto re-target their nuclear weapons \u2014 very expensive \u2014
p209
aVand potentially double their arsenal,
p210
aVto not only take out the original site,
p211
aVbut take out sites where people were going.
p212
aVThis was what apparently, as it turns out, was behind all this.
p213
aVIt was just really, really frightening.
p214
aa(lp215
VThe main point here is we were dealing with
p216
aVa complete disconnect from reality.
p217
aVThe civil defense programs were disconnected
p218
aVfrom the reality of what we'd see in all-out nuclear war.
p219
aVSo organizations like Physicians for Social Responsibility,
p220
aVaround 1979, started saying this a lot publicly.
p221
aVThey would do a bombing run. They'd go to your city,
p222
aVand they'd say, "Here's a map of your city.
p223
aVHere's what's going to happen if we get a nuclear hit."
p224
aVSo no possibility of medical response to,
p225
aVor meaningful preparedness for
p226
aVall-out nuclear war.
p227
aVSo we had to prevent nuclear war
p228
aVif we expected to survive.
p229
aVThis disconnect was never actually resolved.
p230
aVAnd what happened was \u2014
p231
aVwhen we get in to chapter two
p232
aVof the nuclear threat era,
p233
aVwhich started back in 1945.
p234
aa(lp235
VChapter two starts in 1991.
p236
aVWhen the Soviet Union broke up,
p237
aVwe effectively lost that adversary
p238
aVas a potential attacker of the United States, for the most part.
p239
aVIt's not completely gone. I'm going to come back to that.
p240
aVBut from 1991
p241
aVthrough the present time,
p242
aVemphasized by the attacks of 2001,
p243
aVthe idea of an all-out nuclear war
p244
aVhas diminished and the idea of a single event,
p245
aVact of nuclear terrorism
p246
aVis what we have instead.
p247
aVAlthough the scenario has changed
p248
aVvery considerably, the fact is
p249
aVthat we haven't changed our mental image
p250
aVof what a nuclear war means.
p251
aVSo I'm going to tell you what the implications of that are in just a second.
p252
aVSo, what is a nuclear terror threat?
p253
aVAnd there's four key ingredients to describing that.
p254
aa(lp255
VFirst thing is that the global nuclear weapons,
p256
aVin the stockpiles that I showed you in those original maps,
p257
aVhappen to be not uniformly secure.
p258
aVAnd it's particularly not secure
p259
aVin the former Soviet Union, now in Russia.
p260
aVThere are many, many sites where warheads are stored
p261
aVand, in fact, lots of sites where fissionable materials,
p262
aVlike highly enriched uranium and plutonium,
p263
aVare absolutely not safe.
p264
aVThey're available to be bought, stolen, whatever.
p265
aVThey're acquirable, let me put it that way.
p266
aVFrom 1993 through 2006,
p267
aVthe International Atomic Energy Agency
p268
aVdocumented 175 cases of nuclear theft,
p269
aV18 of which involved highly enriched uranium or plutonium,
p270
aVthe key ingredients to make a nuclear weapon.
p271
aVThe global stockpile of highly enriched uranium
p272
aVis about 1,300, at the low end,
p273
aVto about 2,100 metric tons.
p274
aVMore than 100 megatons of this
p275
aVis stored in particularly insecure
p276
aVRussian facilities.
p277
aVHow much of that do you think it would take
p278
aVto actually build a 10-kiloton bomb?
p279
aVWell, you need about 75 pounds of it.
p280
aa(lp281
VSo, what I'd like to show you
p282
aVis
p283
aVwhat it would take to hold 75 pounds
p284
aVof highly enriched uranium.
p285
aVThis is not a product placement. It's just \u2014
p286
aVin fact, if I was Coca Cola, I'd be pretty distressed about this \u2014
p287
aV(Laughter)
p288
aV\u2014 but
p289
aVbasically, this is it.
p290
aa(lp291
VThis is what you would need to steal or buy
p292
aVout of that 100-metric-ton stockpile
p293
aVthat's relatively insecure
p294
aVto create the type of bomb
p295
aVthat was used in Hiroshima.
p296
aVNow you might want to look at plutonium
p297
aVas another fissionable material that you might use in a bomb.
p298
aVThat \u2014 you'd need 10 to 13 pounds of plutonium.
p299
aVNow, plutonium, 10 to 13 pounds:
p300
aVthis. This is enough plutonium
p301
aVto create a Nagasaki-size atomic weapon.
p302
aVNow this situation, already I \u2014
p303
aVyou know, I don't really like thinking about this,
p304
aValthough somehow I got myself a job
p305
aVwhere I have to think about it. So
p306
aVthe point is that we're very, very insecure
p307
aVin terms of developing this material.
p308
aVThe second thing is, what about the know-how?
p309
aa(lp310
VAnd there's a lot of controversy about
p311
aVwhether terror organizations have the know-how
p312
aVto actually make a nuclear weapon.
p313
aVWell, there's a lot of know-how out there.
p314
aVThere's an unbelievable amount of know-how out there.
p315
aVThere's detailed information on how to assemble
p316
aVa nuclear weapon from parts.
p317
aVThere's books about how to build a nuclear bomb.
p318
aVThere are plans for how to create a terror farm
p319
aVwhere you could actually manufacture and develop
p320
aVall the components and assemble it.
p321
aVAll of this information is relatively available.
p322
aVIf you have an undergraduate degree in physics,
p323
aVI would suggest \u2014
p324
aValthough I don't, so maybe it's not even true \u2014
p325
aVbut something close to that would allow you,
p326
aVwith the information that's currently available,
p327
aVto actually build a nuclear weapon.
p328
aa(lp329
VThe third element of the nuclear terror threat
p330
aVis that, who would actually do such a thing?
p331
aVWell, what we're seeing now is a level of terrorism
p332
aVthat involves individuals who are highly organized.
p333
aVThey are very dedicated and committed.
p334
aVThey are stateless.
p335
aVSomebody once said, Al Qaeda
p336
aVdoes not have a return address,
p337
aVso if they attack us with a nuclear weapon,
p338
aVwhat's the response, and to whom is the response?
p339
aVAnd they're retaliation-proof.
p340
aVSince there is no real retribution possible
p341
aVthat would make any difference,
p342
aVsince there are people willing to actually give up their lives
p343
aVin order to do a lot of damage to us,
p344
aVit becomes apparent
p345
aVthat the whole notion
p346
aVof this mutually assured destruction would not work.
p347
aa(lp348
VHere is Sulaiman Abu Ghaith,
p349
aVand Sulaiman was a key lieutenant of Osama Bin Laden.
p350
aVHe wrote many, many times statements to this effect:
p351
aV"we have the right to kill four million Americans,
p352
aVtwo million of whom should be children."
p353
aVAnd we don't have to go overseas
p354
aVto find people willing to do harm, for whatever their reasons.
p355
aVMcVeigh and Nichols, and the Oklahoma City attack
p356
aVin the 1990s
p357
aVwas a good example of homegrown terrorists.
p358
aVWhat if they had gotten their hands on a nuclear weapon?
p359
aVThe fourth element
p360
aVis that the high-value U.S. targets
p361
aVare accessible, soft and plentiful.
p362
aa(lp363
VThis would be a talk for another day, but the level of the preparedness
p364
aVthat the United States has achieved
p365
aVsince 9/11 of '01
p366
aVis unbelievably inadequate.
p367
aVWhat you saw after Katrina
p368
aVis a very good indicator
p369
aVof how little prepared the United States is
p370
aVfor any kind of major attack.
p371
aVSeven million ship cargo containers
p372
aVcome into the United States every year.
p373
aVFive to seven percent only are inspected \u2014
p374
aVfive to seven percent.
p375
aa(lp376
VThis is Alexander Lebed,
p377
aVwho was a general that worked with Yeltsin,
p378
aVwho talked about, and presented to Congress,
p379
aVthis idea that the Russians had developed \u2014
p380
aVthese suitcase bombs. They were very low yield \u2014
p381
aV0.1 to one kiloton,
p382
aVHiroshima was around 13 kilotons \u2014
p383
aVbut enough to do an unbelievable amount of damage.
p384
aVAnd Lebed came to the United States
p385
aVand told us that many, many \u2014
p386
aVmore than 80 of the suitcase bombs
p387
aVwere actually not accountable.
p388
aVAnd they look like this. They're basically very simple arrangements.
p389
aVYou put the elements into a suitcase.
p390
aVIt becomes very portable.
p391
aVThe suitcase can be conveniently dropped
p392
aVin your trunk of your car.
p393
aVYou take it wherever you want to take it, and you can detonate it.
p394
aa(lp395
VYou don't want to build a suitcase bomb,
p396
aVand you happen to get one of those insecure
p397
aVnuclear warheads that exist.
p398
aVThis is the size of
p399
aVthe "Little Boy" bomb that was dropped at Hiroshima.
p400
aVIt was 9.8 feet long,
p401
aVweighed 8,800 pounds. You go down to
p402
aVyour local rent-a-truck
p403
aVand for 50 bucks or so,
p404
aVyou rent a truck that's got the right capacity,
p405
aVand you take your bomb,
p406
aVyou put it in the truck and you're ready to go.
p407
aVIt could happen. But what it would mean and who would survive?
p408
aVYou can't get an exact number for that kind of probability,
p409
aVbut what I'm trying to say is that
p410
aVwe have all the elements of that happening.
p411
aVAnybody who dismisses the thought
p412
aVof a nuclear weapon
p413
aVbeing used by a terrorist is kidding themselves.
p414
aa(lp415
VI think there's a lot of people in the intelligence community \u2014
p416
aVa lot of people who deal with this work in general
p417
aVthink it's almost inevitable, unless we do certain things
p418
aVto really try to defuse the risk,
p419
aVlike better interdiction, better prevention,
p420
aVbetter fixing, you know, better screening
p421
aVof cargo containers that are coming into the country and so forth.
p422
aVThere's a lot that can be done to make us a lot safer.
p423
aVAt this particular moment,
p424
aVwe actually could end up
p425
aVseeing a nuclear detonation in one of our cities.
p426
aVI don't think we would see an all-out nuclear war
p427
aVany time soon, although even that is not completely off the table.
p428
aVThere's still enough nuclear weapons
p429
aVin the arsenals of the superpowers
p430
aVto destroy the Earth many, many times over.
p431
aVThere are flash points in India and Pakistan,
p432
aVin the Middle East, in North Korea,
p433
aVother places where the use of nuclear weapons,
p434
aVwhile initially locally,
p435
aVcould very rapidly
p436
aVgo into a situation
p437
aVwhere we'd be facing all-out nuclear war.
p438
aVIt's very unsettling.
p439
aa(lp440
VHere we go. OK.
p441
aVI'm back in my truck, and we drove over the Brooklyn Bridge.
p442
aVWe're coming down,
p443
aVand we bring that truck
p444
aVthat you just saw
p445
aVsomewhere in here, in the Financial District.
p446
aVThis is a 10-kiloton bomb,
p447
aVslightly smaller than was used
p448
aVin Hiroshima. And I want to just conclude this
p449
aVby just giving you some information. I think \u2014
p450
aV"news you could use" kind of concept here.
p451
aVSo, first of all, this would be horrific
p452
aVbeyond anything we can possibly imagine.
p453
aVThis is the ultimate.
p454
aVAnd if you're in the half-mile radius
p455
aVof where this bomb went off,
p456
aVyou have a 90 percent chance of not making it.
p457
aVIf you're right where the bomb went off,
p458
aVyou will be vaporized. And that's \u2014
p459
aVI'm just telling you, this is not good.
p460
aa(lp461
V(Laughter)
p462
aa(lp463
VYou assume that.
p464
aVTwo-mile radius, you have a 50 percent chance
p465
aVof being killed,
p466
aVand up to about eight miles away \u2014
p467
aVnow I'm talking about killed instantly \u2014
p468
aVsomewhere between a 10 and 20 percent
p469
aVchance of getting killed.
p470
aVThe thing about this is that
p471
aVthe experience of the nuclear detonation is \u2014
p472
aVfirst of all, tens of millions of degrees Fahrenheit
p473
aVat the core here, where it goes off,
p474
aVand an extraordinary amount of energy
p475
aVin the form of heat, acute radiation
p476
aVand blast effects.
p477
aVAn enormous hurricane-like wind,
p478
aVand destruction of buildings almost totally,
p479
aVwithin this yellow circle here.
p480
aVAnd what I'm going to focus on, as I come to conclusion here,
p481
aVis that, what happens to you
p482
aVif you're in here?
p483
aVWell, if we're talking about the old days
p484
aVof an all-out nuclear attack,
p485
aVyou, up here,
p486
aVare as dead as the people here. So it was a moot point.
p487
aVMy point now, though, is that there is a lot
p488
aVthat we could do for you who are in here,
p489
aVif you've survived the initial blast.
p490
aVYou have, when the blast goes off \u2014
p491
aVand by the way, if it ever comes up, don't look at it.
p492
aa(lp493
V(Laughter)
p494
aa(lp495
VIf you look at it, you're going to be blind,
p496
aVeither temporarily or permanently.
p497
aVSo if there's any way that you can avoid,
p498
aVlike, avert your eyes, that would be a good thing.
p499
aVIf you find yourself alive, but
p500
aVyou're in the vicinity of a nuclear weapon,
p501
aVyou have \u2014 that's gone off \u2014
p502
aVyou have 10 to 20 minutes, depending on the size
p503
aVand exactly where it went off,
p504
aVto get out of the way before
p505
aVa lethal amount of radiation
p506
aVcomes straight down from the mushroom cloud that goes up.
p507
aVIn that 10 to 15 minutes, all you have to do \u2014
p508
aVand I mean this seriously \u2014
p509
aVis go about a mile
p510
aVaway from the blast.
p511
aVAnd what happens is \u2014 this is \u2014
p512
aVI'm going to show you now some fallout plumes. Within 20 minutes,
p513
aVit comes straight down. Within 24 hours,
p514
aVlethal radiation is going out with prevailing winds,
p515
aVand it's mostly in this particular direction \u2014
p516
aVit's going northeast.
p517
aa(lp518
VAnd if you're in this vicinity, you've got to get away.
p519
aVSo you're feeling the wind \u2014
p520
aVand there's tremendous wind now
p521
aVthat you're going to be feeling \u2014 and you want to go
p522
aVperpendicular to the wind
p523
aV[not upwind or downwind].
p524
aVif you are in fact able to see where the blast was in front of you.
p525
aVYou've got to get out of there.
p526
aVIf you don't get out of there, you're going to be exposed
p527
aVto lethal radiation in very short order.
p528
aVIf you can't get out of there,
p529
aVwe want you to go into a shelter and stay there.
p530
aVNow, in a shelter in an urban area means
p531
aVyou have to be either in a basement as deep as possible,
p532
aVor you have to be on a floor \u2014 on a high floor \u2014
p533
aVif it's a ground burst explosion, which it would be,
p534
aVhigher than the ninth floor. So you have to be tenth floor or higher,
p535
aVor in the basement.
p536
aVBut basically, you've got to get out of town as quickly as possible.
p537
aVAnd if you do that,
p538
aVyou actually can survive a nuclear blast.
p539
aa(lp540
VOver the next few days to a week,
p541
aVthere will be a radiation cloud,
p542
aVagain, going with the wind, and settling down
p543
aVfor another 15 or 20 miles out \u2014
p544
aVin this case, over Long Island.
p545
aVAnd if you're in the direct fallout zone here,
p546
aVyou really have to either be sheltered or you have to get out of there,
p547
aVand that's clear. But if you are sheltered,
p548
aVyou can actually survive.
p549
aVThe difference between knowing information
p550
aVof what you're going to do personally,
p551
aVand not knowing information, can save your life,
p552
aVand it could mean the difference between
p553
aV150,000 to 200,000 fatalities
p554
aVfrom something like this
p555
aVand half a million to 700,000 fatalities.
p556
aa(lp557
VSo, response planning in the twenty-first century
p558
aVis both possible and is essential.
p559
aVBut in 2008, there isn't one single American city
p560
aVthat has done effective plans
p561
aVto deal with a nuclear detonation disaster.
p562
aVPart of the problem is that
p563
aVthe emergency planners themselves, personally,
p564
aVare overwhelmed psychologically by the thought
p565
aVof nuclear catastrophe.
p566
aVThey are paralyzed.
p567
aVYou say "nuclear" to them, and they're thinking,
p568
aV"Oh my God, we're all gone. What's the point? It's futile."
p569
aVAnd we're trying to tell them, "It's not futile.
p570
aVWe can change the survival rates
p571
aVby doing some commonsensical things."
p572
aa(lp573
VSo the goal here is to minimize fatalities.
p574
aVAnd I just want to leave you with the personal points
p575
aVthat I think you might be interested in.
p576
aVThe key to surviving a nuclear blast
p577
aVis getting out,
p578
aVand not going into harm's way.
p579
aVThat's basically all we're going to be talking about here.
p580
aVAnd the farther you are away in distance,
p581
aVthe longer it is in time
p582
aVfrom the initial blast;
p583
aVand the more separation between you
p584
aVand the outside atmosphere, the better.
p585
aVSo separation \u2014 hopefully with dirt or concrete,
p586
aVor being in a basement \u2014
p587
aVdistance and time is what will save you.
p588
aa(lp589
VSo here's what you do. First of all,
p590
aVas I said, don't stare at the light flash,
p591
aVif you can. I don't know you could possibly resist doing that.
p592
aVBut let's assume, theoretically, you want to do that.
p593
aVYou want to keep your mouth open, so your eardrums
p594
aVdon't burst from the pressures.
p595
aVIf you're very close to what happened, you actually do have to duck and cover,
p596
aVlike Bert told you, Bert the Turtle.
p597
aVAnd you want to get under something so that you're not injured
p598
aVor killed by objects, if that's at all possible.
p599
aVYou want to get away from the initial fallout mushroom cloud,
p600
aVI said, in just a few minutes.
p601
aVAnd shelter and place. You want to move [only]
p602
aVcrosswind for 1.2 miles.
p603
aa(lp604
VYou know, if you're out there and you see buildings horribly destroyed
p605
aVand down in that direction,
p606
aVless destroyed here,
p607
aVthen you know that it was over there, the blast, and you're going this way,
p608
aVas long as you're going crosswise to the wind.
p609
aVOnce you're out and evacuating,
p610
aVyou want to keep as much of your skin,
p611
aVyour mouth and nose covered, as long as that covering
p612
aVdoesn't impede you moving and getting out of there.
p613
aVAnd finally, you want to get decontaminated as soon as possible.
p614
aVAnd if you're wearing clothing, you've taken off your clothing,
p615
aVyou're going to get showered down some place
p616
aVand remove the radiation that would be \u2014
p617
aVthe radioactive material that might be on you.
p618
aVAnd then you want to stay in shelter for 48 to 72 hours minimum,
p619
aVbut you're going to wait hopefully \u2014 you'll have your little wind-up,
p620
aVbattery-less radio,
p621
aVand you'll be waiting for people to tell you
p622
aVwhen it's safe to go outside. That's what you need to do.
p623
aa(lp624
VIn conclusion,
p625
aVnuclear war is less likely than before,
p626
aVbut by no means out of the question, and it's not survivable.
p627
aVNuclear terrorism is possible \u2014 it may be probable \u2014
p628
aVbut is survivable.
p629
aVAnd this is Jack Geiger, who's one of the heroes
p630
aVof the U.S. public health community.
p631
aVAnd Jack said the only way to deal
p632
aVwith nuclear anything,
p633
aVwhether it's war or terrorism,
p634
aVis abolition of nuclear weapons.
p635
aVAnd you want something to work on once you've fixed global warming,
p636
aVI urge you to think about the fact that
p637
aVwe have to do something about this
p638
aVunacceptable, inhumane
p639
aVreality of nuclear weapons
p640
aVin our world.
p641
aa(lp642
VNow, this is my favorite civil defense slide, and I \u2014
p643
aV(Laughter)
p644
aV\u2014 I don't want to be indelicate, but
p645
aVthis \u2014
p646
aVhe's no longer in office. We don't really care, OK.
p647
aVThis was sent to me by somebody
p648
aVwho is an aficionado of civil defense procedures,
p649
aVbut the fact of the matter is that
p650
aVAmerica's gone through a very hard time.
p651
aVWe've not been focused, we've not done what we had to do,
p652
aVand now we're facing the potential of

aVbad, hell on Earth.
