VHumans in the developed world
p4
aVspend more than 90 percent of their lives indoors,
p5
aVwhere they breathe in and come into contact
p6
aVwith trillions of life forms invisible to the naked eye:
p7
aVmicroorganisms.
p8
aVBuildings are complex ecosystems
p9
aVthat are an important source
p10
aVof microbes that are good for us,
p11
aVand some that are bad for us.
p12
aVWhat determines the types and distributions
p13
aVof microbes indoors?
p14
aVBuildings are colonized by airborne microbes
p15
aVthat enter through windows
p16
aVand through mechanical ventilation systems.
p17
aVAnd they are brought inside
p18
aVby humans and other creatures.
p19
aVThe fate of microbes indoors
p20
aVdepends on complex interactions
p21
aVwith humans,
p22
aVand with the human-built environment.
p23
aVAnd today, architects and biologists
p24
aVare working together
p25
aVto explore smart building design
p26
aVthat will create
p27
aVhealthy buildings for us.
p28
aa(lp29
VWe spend an extraordinary amount of time
p30
aVin buildings
p31
aVthat are extremely controlled environments,
p32
aVlike this building here \u2014
p33
aVenvironments that have mechanical ventilation systems
p34
aVthat include filtering,
p35
aVheating and air conditioning.
p36
aVGiven the amount of time that we spend indoors,
p37
aVit's important to understand
p38
aVhow this affects our health.
p39
aVAt the Biology and the Built Environment Center,
p40
aVwe carried out a study in a hospital
p41
aVwhere we sampled air
p42
aVand pulled the DNA
p43
aVout of microbes in the air.
p44
aVAnd we looked at three different types of rooms.
p45
aVWe looked at rooms that were mechanically ventilated,
p46
aVwhich are the data points in the blue.
p47
aVWe looked at rooms that were naturally ventilated,
p48
aVwhere the hospital let us turn off the mechanical ventilation
p49
aVin a wing of the building
p50
aVand pry open the windows
p51
aVthat were no longer operable,
p52
aVbut they made them operable for our study.
p53
aVAnd we also sampled the outdoor air.
p54
aa(lp55
VIf you look at the x-axis of this graph,
p56
aVyou'll see that what we commonly want to do \u2014
p57
aVwhich is keeping the outdoors out \u2014
p58
aVwe accomplished that with mechanical ventilation.
p59
aVSo if you look at the green data points,
p60
aVwhich is air that's outside,
p61
aVyou'll see that there's a large amount of microbial diversity,
p62
aVor variety of microbial types.
p63
aVBut if you look at the blue data points,
p64
aVwhich is mechanically ventilated air,
p65
aVit's not as diverse.
p66
aVBut being less diverse
p67
aVis not necessarily good for our health.
p68
aVIf you look at the y-axis of this graph,
p69
aVyou'll see that, in the mechanically ventilated air,
p70
aVyou have a higher probability
p71
aVof encountering a potential pathogen,
p72
aVor germ,
p73
aVthan if you're outdoors.
p74
aa(lp75
VSo to understand why this was the case,
p76
aVwe took our data
p77
aVand put it into an ordination diagram,
p78
aVwhich is a statistical map
p79
aVthat tells you something
p80
aVabout how related the microbial communities are
p81
aVin the different samples.
p82
aVThe data points that are closer together
p83
aVhave microbial communities that are more similar
p84
aVthan data points that are far apart.
p85
aVAnd the first things that you can see from this graph
p86
aVis, if you look at the blue data points,
p87
aVwhich are the mechanically ventilated air,
p88
aVthey're not simply a subset of the green data points,
p89
aVwhich are the outdoor air.
p90
aa(lp91
VWhat we've found is that mechanically ventilated air
p92
aVlooks like humans.
p93
aVIt has microbes on it
p94
aVthat are commonly associated with our skin
p95
aVand with our mouth, our spit.
p96
aVAnd this is because
p97
aVwe're all constantly shedding microbes.
p98
aVSo all of you right now
p99
aVare sharing your microbes with one another.
p100
aVAnd when you're outdoors,
p101
aVthat type of air has microbes
p102
aVthat are commonly associated with plant leaves and with dirt.
p103
aa(lp104
VWhy does this matter?
p105
aVIt matters because the health care industry
p106
aVis the second most energy intensive industry
p107
aVin the United States.
p108
aVHospitals use two and a half times
p109
aVthe amount of energy as office buildings.
p110
aVAnd the model that we're working with
p111
aVin hospitals,
p112
aVand also with many, many different buildings,
p113
aVis to keep the outdoors out.
p114
aVAnd this model
p115
aVmay not necessarily be the best for our health.
p116
aVAnd given the extraordinary amount
p117
aVof nosocomial infections,
p118
aVor hospital-acquired infections,
p119
aVthis is a clue that it's a good time
p120
aVto reconsider our current practices.
p121
aa(lp122
VSo just as we manage national parks,
p123
aVwhere we promote the growth of some species
p124
aVand we inhibit the growth of others,
p125
aVwe're working towards thinking about buildings
p126
aVusing an ecosystem framework
p127
aVwhere we can promote the kinds of microbes
p128
aVthat we want to have indoors.
p129
aVI've heard somebody say
p130
aVthat you're as healthy as your gut.
p131
aVAnd for this reason, many people eat probiotic yogurt
p132
aVso they can promote a healthy gut flora.
p133
aVAnd what we ultimately want to do
p134
aVis to be able to use this concept
p135
aVto promote a healthy group
p136
aVof microorganisms inside.
