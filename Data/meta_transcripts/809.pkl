VI'm standing in front of you today
p4
aVin all humility,
p5
aVwanting to share with you
p6
aVmy journey of the last six years
p7
aVin the field of service
p8
aVand education.
p9
aVAnd I'm not a trained academic.
p10
aVNeither am I a veteran social worker.
p11
aVI was 26 years in the corporate world,
p12
aVtrying to make organizations profitable.
p13
aVAnd then in 2003
p14
aVI started Parikrma Humanity Foundation
p15
aVfrom my kitchen table.
p16
aa(lp17
VThe first thing that we did was walk through the slums.
p18
aVYou know, by the way, there are two million people
p19
aVin Bangalore, who live in 800 slums.
p20
aVWe couldn't go to all the slums,
p21
aVbut we tried to cover as much as we could.
p22
aVWe walked through these slums,
p23
aVidentified houses where children would never go to school.
p24
aVWe talked to the parents,
p25
aVtried to convince them about sending their children to school.
p26
aVWe played with the children,
p27
aVand came back home really tired,
p28
aVexhausted, but with images
p29
aVof bright faces, twinkling eyes,
p30
aVand went to sleep.
p31
aa(lp32
VWe were all excited to start,
p33
aVbut the numbers hit us then:
p34
aV200 million children
p35
aVbetween four to 14 that
p36
aVshould be going to school, but do not;
p37
aV100 million children
p38
aVwho go to school but cannot read;
p39
aV125 million who cannot do basic maths.
p40
aVWe also heard that 250 billion Indian rupees
p41
aVwas dedicated for government schooling.
p42
aVNinety percent of it was spent on teachers' salary
p43
aVand administrators' salary.
p44
aVAnd yet, India has nearly
p45
aVthe highest teacher absenteeism
p46
aVin the world,
p47
aVwith one out of four teachers
p48
aVnot going to school at all the entire academic year.
p49
aa(lp50
VThose numbers were absolutely mind-boggling,
p51
aVoverwhelming, and we were constantly asked,
p52
aV"When will you start? How many schools will you start?
p53
aVHow many children will you get?
p54
aVHow are you going to scale?
p55
aVHow are you going to replicate?"
p56
aVIt was very difficult not to get scared, not to get daunted.
p57
aVBut we dug our heels
p58
aVand said, "We're not in the number game.
p59
aVWe want to take one child at a time
p60
aVand take the child right through school,
p61
aVsent to college,
p62
aVand get them prepared for better living,
p63
aVa high value job."
p64
aa(lp65
VSo, we started Parikrma.
p66
aVThe first Parikrma school
p67
aVstarted in a slum
p68
aVwhere there were 70,000 people
p69
aVliving below the poverty line.
p70
aVOur first school was
p71
aVon a rooftop of a building inside the slums,
p72
aVa second story building, the only second story building
p73
aVinside the slums.
p74
aVAnd that rooftop did not have
p75
aVany ceiling, only half a tin sheet.
p76
aVThat was our first school. One hundred sixty-five children.
p77
aVIndian academic year begins in June.
p78
aVSo, June it rains, so many a times
p79
aVall of us would be huddled under the tin roof,
p80
aVwaiting for the rain to stop.
p81
aVMy God! What a bonding exercise that was.
p82
aVAnd all of us
p83
aVthat were under that roof are still here together today.
p84
aVThen came the second school,
p85
aVthe third school, the fourth school
p86
aVand a junior college.
p87
aVIn six years now,
p88
aVwe have four schools, one junior college,
p89
aV1,100 children
p90
aVcoming from 28 slums
p91
aVand four orphanages.
p92
aV(Applause)
p93
aa(lp94
VOur dream is very simple:
p95
aVto send each of these kids, get them prepared
p96
aVto be educated
p97
aVbut also to live peacefully,
p98
aVcontented in this conflict-ridden
p99
aVchaotic globalized world.
p100
aVNow, when you talk global
p101
aVyou have to talk English.
p102
aVAnd so all our schools
p103
aVare English medium schools.
p104
aVBut they know there is this myth
p105
aVthat children from the slums
p106
aVcannot speak English well.
p107
aVNo one in their family has spoken English.
p108
aVNo one in their generation has spoken English.
p109
aVBut how wrong it is.
p110
aa(lp111
VGirl: I like adventurous books, and some of my favorites
p112
aVare Alfred Hitchcock and [unclear]
p113
aVand Hardy Boys.
p114
aVAlthough they are like
p115
aVin different contexts,
p116
aVone is magical, the other two are like investigation,
p117
aVI like those books because
p118
aVthey have something special in them.
p119
aVThe vocabulary used in those books
p120
aVand the style of writing.
p121
aVI mean like once I pick up one book
p122
aVI cannot put it down until I finish the whole book.
p123
aVEven if it takes me four and a half hours,
p124
aVor three and half hours to finish my book, I do it.
p125
aa(lp126
VBoy: I did good research and I got the information
p127
aV[on the] world's fastest cars.
p128
aVI like Ducati ZZ143,
p129
aVbecause it is the fastest,
p130
aVthe world's fastest bike,
p131
aVand I like Pulsar 220 DTSI
p132
aVbecause it is India's fastest bike. (Laughter)
p133
aa(lp134
VShukla Bose: Well, that girl that you saw,
p135
aVher father sells flowers on the roadside.
p136
aVAnd this little boy has been coming to school for five years.
p137
aVBut isn't it strange that little boys all over the world
p138
aVlove fast bikes? (Laughter)
p139
aVHe hasn't seen one, he hasn't ridden one, of course,
p140
aVbut he has done a lot of research through Google search.
p141
aVYou know, when we started with our English medium schools
p142
aVwe also decided to adopt
p143
aVthe best curriculum possible,
p144
aVthe ICSE curriculum.
p145
aVAnd again, there were people who laughed at me
p146
aVand said, "Don't be crazy
p147
aVchoosing such a tough curriculum for these students.
p148
aVThey'll never be able to cope."
p149
aVNot only do our children cope very well,
p150
aVbut they excel in it.
p151
aVYou should just come across to see
p152
aVhow well our children do.
p153
aa(lp154
VThere is also this myth that
p155
aVparents from the slums
p156
aVare not interested in their children going to school;
p157
aVthey'd much rather put them to work.
p158
aVThat's absolute hogwash.
p159
aVAll parents all over the world
p160
aVwant their children to lead a better life than themselves,
p161
aVbut they need to believe that change is possible.
p162
aa(lp163
VVideo: (Hindi)
p164
aa(lp165
VSB: We have 80 percent attendance
p166
aVfor all our parents-teachers meeting.
p167
aVSometimes it's even 100 percent,
p168
aVmuch more than many privileged schools.
p169
aVFathers have started to attend.
p170
aVIt's very interesting. When we started our school
p171
aVthe parents would give thumbprints in the attendance register.
p172
aVNow they have started writing their signature.
p173
aVThe children have taught them.
p174
aVIt's amazing how much children can teach.
p175
aa(lp176
VWe have, a few months ago,
p177
aVactually late last year,
p178
aVwe had a few mothers who came to us and said,
p179
aV"You know, we want to learn how to read and write.
p180
aVCan you teach us?" So, we started an afterschool
p181
aVfor our parents, for our mothers.
p182
aVWe had 25 mothers who came regularly
p183
aVafter school to study.
p184
aVWe want to continue with this program
p185
aVand extend it to all our other schools.
p186
aa(lp187
VNinety-eight percent of our fathers are alcoholics.
p188
aVSo, you can imagine how traumatized
p189
aVand how dysfunctional the houses are where our children come from.
p190
aVWe have to send the fathers to de-addiction labs
p191
aVand when they come back,
p192
aVmost times sober, we have to find a job for them
p193
aVso that they don't regress.
p194
aVWe have about three fathers who have been trained to cook.
p195
aVWe have taught them nutrition, hygiene.
p196
aVWe have helped them set up the kitchen
p197
aVand now they are supplying food to all our children.
p198
aVThey do a very good job because
p199
aVtheir children are eating their food,
p200
aVbut most importantly this is the first time
p201
aVthey have got respect,
p202
aVand they feel that they are doing something worthwhile.
p203
aa(lp204
VMore than 90 percent of our non-teaching staff
p205
aVare all parents and extended families.
p206
aVWe've started many programs
p207
aVjust to make sure that the child comes to school.
p208
aVVocational skill program for the older siblings
p209
aVso the younger ones are not stopped from coming to school.
p210
aa(lp211
VThere is also this myth that children from the slums
p212
aVcannot integrate with mainstream.
p213
aVTake a look at this little girl
p214
aVwho was one of the 28 children
p215
aVfrom all privileged schools,
p216
aVbest schools in the country
p217
aVthat was selected for the Duke University
p218
aVtalent identification program
p219
aVand was sent to IIM Ahmedabad.
p220
aa(lp221
VVideo: Girl: Duke IIMA Camp. Whenever we see that IIMA,
p222
aVit was such a pride for us to go to that camp.
p223
aVEverybody was very friendly,
p224
aVespecially I got a lot of friends.
p225
aVAnd I felt that my English has improved a lot
p226
aVgoing there and chatting with friends.
p227
aVThere they met children who are
p228
aVwith a different standard and
p229
aVa different mindset, a totally different society.
p230
aVI mingled with almost everyone.
p231
aVThey were very friendly.
p232
aVI had very good friends there,
p233
aVwho are from Delhi, who are from Mumbai.
p234
aVEven now we are in touch through Facebook.
p235
aa(lp236
VAfter this Ahmedabad trip
p237
aVI've been like a totally different
p238
aVmingling with people and all of those.
p239
aVBefore that I feel like I wasn't like this.
p240
aVI don't even mingle, or start speaking with someone so quickly.
p241
aVMy accent with English improved a lot.
p242
aVAnd I learned football, volleyball,
p243
aVFrisbee, lots of games.
p244
aVAnd I wouldn't want to go to Bangalore. Let me stay here.
p245
aVSuch beautiful food,
p246
aVI enjoyed it. It was so beautiful.
p247
aVI enjoyed eating food like
p248
aV[unclear] would come and ask me,
p249
aV"Yes ma'am, what you want?" It was so good to hear!
p250
aa(lp251
V(Laughter)
p252
aV(Applause)
p253
aa(lp254
VSB: This girl was working as a maid
p255
aVbefore she came to school.
p256
aVAnd today she wants to be a neurologist.
p257
aa(lp258
VOur children are doing brilliantly in sports.
p259
aVThey are really excelling.
p260
aVThere is an inter-school athletic competition
p261
aVthat is held every year
p262
aVin Bangalore, where 5,000 children participate
p263
aVfrom 140 best schools in the city.
p264
aVWe've got the best school award for three years successively.
p265
aVAnd our children are coming back home
p266
aVwith bags full of medals, with lots of admirers and friends.
p267
aVLast year there were a couple of kids
p268
aVfrom elite schools that came
p269
aVto ask for admissions in our school.
p270
aVWe also have our very own dream team.
p271
aa(lp272
VWhy is this happening? Why this confidence?
p273
aVIs it the exposure? We have professors
p274
aVfrom MIT, Berkeley, Stanford,
p275
aVIndian Institute of Science
p276
aVwho come and teach our children lots of scientific formulas,
p277
aVexperiments, much beyond the classroom.
p278
aVArt, music are considered
p279
aVtherapy and mediums of expression.
p280
aVWe also believe that
p281
aVit's the content that is more important.
p282
aVIt is not the infrastructure,
p283
aVnot the toilets, not the libraries,
p284
aVbut it is what actually happens in this school
p285
aVthat is more important.
p286
aVCreating an environment of learning,
p287
aVof inquiry, of exploration
p288
aVis what is true education.
p289
aa(lp290
VWhen we started Parikrma
p291
aVwe had no idea which direction we were taking.
p292
aVWe didn't hire McKinsey to do a business plan.
p293
aVBut we know for sure that
p294
aVwhat we want to do today is
p295
aVtake one child at a time,
p296
aVnot get bogged with numbers,
p297
aVand actually see the child complete
p298
aVthe circle of life,
p299
aVand unleash his total potential.
p300
aVWe do not believe in scale
p301
aVbecause we believe in quality,
p302
aVand scale and numbers will automatically happen.
p303
aVWe have corporates that have stood behind us,
p304
aVand we are able to, now, open more schools.
p305
aVBut we began with the idea
p306
aVof one child at a time.
p307
aa(lp308
VThis is five-year-old Parusharam.
p309
aVHe was begging
p310
aVby a bus stop a few years ago,
p311
aVgot picked up and is now in an orphanage,
p312
aVhas been coming to school for the last four and a half months.
p313
aVHe's in kindergarten.
p314
aVHe has learned how to speak English.
p315
aVWe have a model by which kids can speak English
p316
aVand understand English
p317
aVin three month's time.
p318
aVHe can tell you stories in English
p319
aVof the thirsty crow, of the crocodile
p320
aVand of the giraffe.
p321
aVAnd if you ask him what he likes to do
p322
aVhe will say, "I like sleeping.
p323
aVI like eating. I like playing."
p324
aVAnd if you ask him what he wants to do,
p325
aVhe will say, "I want to horsing."
p326
aVNow, "horsing" is going for a horse ride.
p327
aVSo, Parusharam comes to my office every day.
p328
aVHe comes for a tummy rub,
p329
aVbecause he believes that will give me luck. (Laughter)
p330
aa(lp331
VWhen I started Parikrma
p332
aVI began with a great deal of arrogance
p333
aVof transforming the world.
p334
aVBut today I have been transformed.
p335
aVI have been changed with my children.
p336
aVI've learned so much from them:
p337
aVlove, compassion, imagination
p338
aVand such creativity.
p339
aVParusharam is Parikrma
p340
aVwith a simple beginning but a long way to go.
p341
aVI promise you, Parusharam
p342
aVwill speak in the TED conference a few years from now.
p343
aVThank you.
