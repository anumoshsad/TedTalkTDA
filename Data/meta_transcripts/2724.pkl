VNo one will ever pay you what you're worth.
p4
aVNo one will ever pay you
p5
aVwhat you're worth.
p6
aVThey'll only ever pay you
p7
aVwhat they think you're worth.
p8
aVAnd you control their thinking,
p9
aVnot like this,
p10
aValthough that would be cool.
p11
aa(lp12
V(Laughter)
p13
aa(lp14
VThat would be really cool.
p15
aVInstead, like this:
p16
aVclearly defining and communicating your value are essential
p17
aVto being paid well for your excellence.
p18
aa(lp19
VAnyone here want to be paid well?
p20
aVOK, good,
p21
aVthen this talk is for everyone.
p22
aVIt's got universal applicability.
p23
aVIt's true if you're a business owner, if you're an employee,
p24
aVif you're a job seeker.
p25
aVIt's true if you're a man or a woman.
p26
aa(lp27
VNow, I approach this today through the lens of the woman business owner,
p28
aVbecause in my work I've observed that women underprice more so than men.
p29
aVThe gender wage gap is a well-traveled narrative in this country.
p30
aVAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics,
p31
aVa woman employee earns just 83 cents for every dollar a man earns.
p32
aVWhat may surprise you
p33
aVis that this trend continues even into the entrepreneurial sphere.
p34
aVA woman business owner earns just 80 cents for every dollar a man earns.
p35
aVIn my work, I've often heard women express
p36
aVthat they're uncomfortable communicating their value,
p37
aVespecially early on in business ownership.
p38
aVThey say things like,
p39
aV"I don't like to toot my own horn."
p40
aV"I'd rather let the work speak for itself."
p41
aV"I don't like to sing my own praises."
p42
aa(lp43
VI hear very different narratives in working with male business owners,
p44
aVand I think this difference is costing women 20 cents on the dollar.
p45
aa(lp46
VI'd like to tell you the story of a consulting firm
p47
aVthat helps their clients dramatically improve their profitability.
p48
aVThat company is my company.
p49
aVAfter my first year in business, I saw the profit increases
p50
aVthat my clients were realizing in working with me,
p51
aVand I realized that I needed to reevaluate my pricing.
p52
aVI was really underpriced relative to the value I was delivering.
p53
aVIt's hard for me to admit to you, because I'm a pricing consultant.
p54
aa(lp55
V(Laughter)
p56
aa(lp57
VIt's what I do.
p58
aVI help companies price for value.
p59
aVBut nonetheless, it's what I saw,
p60
aVand so I sat down to evaluate my pricing, evaluate my value,
p61
aVand I did that by asking key value questions.
p62
aVWhat are my clients' needs and how do I meet them?
p63
aVWhat is my unique skill set that makes me better qualified to serve my clients?
p64
aVWhat do I do that no one else does?
p65
aVWhat problems do I solve for clients?
p66
aVWhat value do I add?
p67
aVI answered these questions
p68
aVand defined the value that my clients get from working with me,
p69
aVcalculated their return on investment,
p70
aVand what I saw was that I needed to double my price,
p71
aVdouble it.
p72
aVNow, I confess to you, this terrified me.
p73
aVI'm supposed to be the expert in this, but I'm not cured.
p74
aVI knew the value was there.
p75
aVI was convinced the value was there,
p76
aVand I was still scared out of my wits.
p77
aVWhat if nobody would pay me that?
p78
aVWhat if clients said, "That's ridiculous.
p79
aVYou're ridiculous."
p80
aa(lp81
VWas I really worth that?
p82
aVNot my work, mind you, but me.
p83
aVWas I worth that?
p84
aVI'm the mother of two beautiful little girls who depend upon me.
p85
aVI'm a single mom.
p86
aVWhat if my business fails?
p87
aVWhat if I fail?
p88
aa(lp89
VBut I know how to take my own medicine,
p90
aVthe medicine that I prescribe to my clients.
p91
aVI had done the homework.
p92
aVI knew the value was there.
p93
aVSo when prospects came,
p94
aVI prepared the proposals with the new higher pricing
p95
aVand sent them out
p96
aVand communicated the value.
p97
aVHow's the story end?
p98
aVClients continued to hire me
p99
aVand refer me and recommend me, and I'm still here.
p100
aVAnd I share this story
p101
aVbecause doubts and fears are natural and normal.
p102
aVBut they don't define our value,
p103
aVand they shouldn't limit our earning potential.
p104
aa(lp105
VI'd like to share another story,
p106
aVabout a woman who learned to communicate her value
p107
aVand found her own voice.
p108
aVShe runs a successful web development company
p109
aVand employs several people.
p110
aVWhen she first started her firm and for several years thereafter,
p111
aVshe would say, "I have a little web design company."
p112
aVShe'd actually use those words with clients.
p113
aV"I have a little web design company."
p114
aVIn this and in many other small ways,
p115
aVshe was diminishing her company in the eyes of prospects and clients,
p116
aVand diminishing herself.
p117
aVIt was really impacting her ability to earn what she was worth.
p118
aVI believe her language and her style
p119
aVcommunicated that she didn't believe
p120
aVshe had much value to offer.
p121
aVIn her own words, she was practically giving her services away.
p122
aVAnd so she began her journey
p123
aVto take responsibility for communicating value to clients
p124
aVand changing her message.
p125
aa(lp126
VOne thing I shared with her
p127
aVis that it's so important
p128
aVto find your own voice,
p129
aVa voice that's authentic and true to you.
p130
aVDon't try to channel your sister-in-law just because she's a great salesperson
p131
aVor your neighbor who tells a great joke if that's not who you are.
p132
aVGive up this notion that it's tooting your own horn.
p133
aVMake it about the other party.
p134
aVFocus on serving and adding value, and it won't feel like bragging.
p135
aVWhat do you love about what you do?
p136
aVWhat excites you about the work that you do?
p137
aVIf you connect with that, communicating your value will come naturally.
p138
aa(lp139
VSo she embraced her natural style,
p140
aVfound her voice and changed her message.
p141
aVFor one thing, she stopped calling herself a little web design company.
p142
aVShe really found a lot of strength and power in communicating her message.
p143
aVShe's now charging three times as much for web design,
p144
aVand her business is growing.
p145
aVShe told me about a recent meeting
p146
aVwith a gruff and sometimes difficult client
p147
aVwho had called a meeting questioning progress on search engine optimization.
p148
aVShe said in the old days,
p149
aVthat would have been a really intimidating meeting for her,
p150
aVbut her mindset was different.
p151
aVShe said, she prepared the information, sat down with the client,
p152
aVsaid this isn't about me, it's not personal,
p153
aVit's about the client.
p154
aVShe took them through the data, through the numbers,
p155
aVlaid out the trends and the progress in her own voice and in her own way,
p156
aVbut very directly said, "Here's what we've done for you."
p157
aVThe client sat up and took notice, and said, "OK, I got it."
p158
aVAnd she said in describing that meeting,
p159
aV"I didn't feel scared or panicky
p160
aVor small,
p161
aVwhich is how I used to feel.
p162
aVInstead I feel like, 'OK, I got this.
p163
aVI know what I'm doing. I'm confident.'"
p164
aa(lp165
VBeing properly valued is so important.
p166
aVYou can hear in this story
p167
aVthat the implications range far beyond just finances
p168
aVinto the realm of self-respect and self-confidence.
p169
aVToday I've told two stories, one about defining our value
p170
aVand the other about communicating our value,
p171
aVand these are the two elements to realizing our full earning potential.
p172
aVThat's the equation.
p173
aVAnd if you're sitting in the audience today
p174
aVand you're not being paid what you're worth,
p175
aVI'd like to welcome you into this equation.
p176
aVJust imagine what life could be like,
p177
aVhow much more we could do,
p178
aVhow much more we could give back,
p179
aVhow much more we could plan for the future,
p180
aVhow validated and respected we would feel
p181
aVif we could earn our full potential,
p182
aVrealize our full value.
p183
aa(lp184
VNo one will ever pay you what you're worth.
p185
aVThey'll only ever pay you what they think you're worth,
p186
aVand you control their thinking.
p187
aa(lp188
VThank you.
