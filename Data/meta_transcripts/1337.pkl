VI think we have to do something
p4
aVabout a piece of the culture of medicine that has to change.
p5
aVAnd I think it starts with one physician, and that's me.
p6
aVAnd maybe I've been around long enough
p7
aVthat I can afford to give away some of my false prestige
p8
aVto be able to do that.
p9
aVBefore I actually begin the meat of my talk,
p10
aVlet's begin with a bit of baseball.
p11
aVHey, why not?
p12
aVWe're near the end, we're getting close to the World Series.
p13
aVWe all love baseball, don't we?
p14
aV(Laughter)
p15
aVBaseball is filled with some amazing statistics.
p16
aVAnd there's hundreds of them.
p17
aV"Moneyball" is about to come out, and it's all about statistics
p18
aVand using statistics to build a great baseball team.
p19
aVI'm going to focus on one stat
p20
aVthat I hope a lot of you have heard of.
p21
aVIt's called batting average.
p22
aVSo we talk about a 300, a batter who bats 300.
p23
aVThat means that ballplayer batted safely, hit safely
p24
aVthree times out of 10 at bats.
p25
aVThat means hit the ball into the outfield,
p26
aVit dropped, it didn't get caught,
p27
aVand whoever tried to throw it to first base didn't get there in time
p28
aVand the runner was safe.
p29
aVThree times out of 10.
p30
aVDo you know what they call a 300 hitter
p31
aVin Major League Baseball?
p32
aVGood, really good,
p33
aVmaybe an all-star.
p34
aVDo you know what they call
p35
aVa 400 baseball hitter?
p36
aVThat's somebody who hit, by the way,
p37
aVfour times safely out of every 10.
p38
aVLegendary \u2014
p39
aVas in Ted Williams legendary \u2014
p40
aVthe last Major League Baseball player
p41
aVto hit over 400 during a regular season.
p42
aVNow let's take this back into my world of medicine
p43
aVwhere I'm a lot more comfortable,
p44
aVor perhaps a bit less comfortable
p45
aVafter what I'm going to talk to you about.
p46
aVSuppose you have appendicitis
p47
aVand you're referred to a surgeon
p48
aVwho's batting 400 on appendectomies.
p49
aV(Laughter)
p50
aVSomehow this isn't working out, is it?
p51
aVNow suppose you live
p52
aVin a certain part of a certain remote place
p53
aVand you have a loved one
p54
aVwho has blockages in two coronary arteries
p55
aVand your family doctor refers that loved one to a cardiologist
p56
aVwho's batting 200 on angioplasties.
p57
aVBut, but, you know what?
p58
aVShe's doing a lot better this year. She's on the comeback trail.
p59
aVAnd she's hitting a 257.
p60
aVSomehow this isn't working.
p61
aVBut I'm going to ask you a question.
p62
aVWhat do you think a batting average
p63
aVfor a cardiac surgeon or a nurse practitioner
p64
aVor an orthopedic surgeon,
p65
aVan OBGYN, a paramedic
p66
aVis supposed to be?
p67
aV1,000, very good.
p68
aVNow truth of the matter is,
p69
aVnobody knows in all of medicine
p70
aVwhat a good surgeon
p71
aVor physician or paramedic
p72
aVis supposed to bat.
p73
aVWhat we do though is we send each one of them, including myself,
p74
aVout into the world
p75
aVwith the admonition, be perfect.
p76
aVNever ever, ever make a mistake,
p77
aVbut you worry about the details, about how that's going to happen.
p78
aVAnd that was the message that I absorbed
p79
aVwhen I was in med school.
p80
aVI was an obsessive compulsive student.
p81
aVIn high school, a classmate once said
p82
aVthat Brian Goldman would study for a blood test.
p83
aV(Laughter)
p84
aVAnd so I did.
p85
aVAnd I studied in my little garret
p86
aVat the nurses' residence at Toronto General Hospital,
p87
aVnot far from here.
p88
aVAnd I memorized everything.
p89
aVI memorized in my anatomy class
p90
aVthe origins and exertions of every muscle,
p91
aVevery branch of every artery that came off the aorta,
p92
aVdifferential diagnoses obscure and common.
p93
aVI even knew the differential diagnosis
p94
aVin how to classify renal tubular acidosis.
p95
aVAnd all the while,
p96
aVI was amassing more and more knowledge.
p97
aVAnd I did well, I graduated with honors,
p98
aVcum laude.
p99
aVAnd I came out of medical school
p100
aVwith the impression
p101
aVthat if I memorized everything and knew everything,
p102
aVor as much as possible,
p103
aVas close to everything as possible,
p104
aVthat it would immunize me against making mistakes.
p105
aVAnd it worked
p106
aVfor a while,
p107
aVuntil I met Mrs. Drucker.
p108
aVI was a resident at a teaching hospital here in Toronto
p109
aVwhen Mrs. Drucker was brought to the emergency department
p110
aVof the hospital where I was working.
p111
aVAt the time I was assigned to the cardiology service
p112
aVon a cardiology rotation.
p113
aVAnd it was my job,
p114
aVwhen the emergency staff called for a cardiology consult,
p115
aVto see that patient in emerg.
p116
aVand to report back to my attending.
p117
aVAnd I saw Mrs. Drucker, and she was breathless.
p118
aVAnd when I listened to her, she was making a wheezy sound.
p119
aVAnd when I listened to her chest with a stethoscope,
p120
aVI could hear crackly sounds on both sides
p121
aVthat told me that she was in congestive heart failure.
p122
aVThis is a condition in which the heart fails,
p123
aVand instead of being able to pump all the blood forward,
p124
aVsome of the blood backs up into the lung, the lungs fill up with blood,
p125
aVand that's why you have shortness of breath.
p126
aVAnd that wasn't a difficult diagnosis to make.
p127
aVI made it and I set to work treating her.
p128
aVI gave her aspirin. I gave her medications to relieve the strain on her heart.
p129
aVI gave her medications that we call diuretics, water pills,
p130
aVto get her to pee out the access fluid.
p131
aVAnd over the course of the next hour and a half or two,
p132
aVshe started to feel better.
p133
aVAnd I felt really good.
p134
aVAnd that's when I made my first mistake;
p135
aVI sent her home.
p136
aVActually, I made two more mistakes.
p137
aVI sent her home
p138
aVwithout speaking to my attending.
p139
aVI didn't pick up the phone and do what I was supposed to do,
p140
aVwhich was call my attending and run the story by him
p141
aVso he would have a chance to see her for himself.
p142
aVAnd he knew her,
p143
aVhe would have been able to furnish additional information about her.
p144
aVMaybe I did it for a good reason.
p145
aVMaybe I didn't want to be a high-maintenance resident.
p146
aVMaybe I wanted to be so successful
p147
aVand so able to take responsibility
p148
aVthat I would do so
p149
aVand I would be able to take care of my attending's patients
p150
aVwithout even having to contact him.
p151
aVThe second mistake that I made was worse.
p152
aVIn sending her home,
p153
aVI disregarded a little voice deep down inside
p154
aVthat was trying to tell me,
p155
aV"Goldman, not a good idea. Don't do this."
p156
aVIn fact, so lacking in confidence was I
p157
aVthat I actually asked the nurse
p158
aVwho was looking after Mrs. Drucker,
p159
aV"Do you think it's okay if she goes home?"
p160
aVAnd the nurse thought about it
p161
aVand said very matter-of-factly, "Yeah, I think she'll do okay."
p162
aVI can remember that like it was yesterday.
p163
aVSo I signed the discharge papers,
p164
aVand an ambulance came, paramedics came to take her home.
p165
aVAnd I went back to my work on the wards.
p166
aVAll the rest of that day,
p167
aVthat afternoon,
p168
aVI had this kind of gnawing feeling inside my stomach.
p169
aVBut I carried on with my work.
p170
aVAnd at the end of the day, I packed up to leave the hospital
p171
aVand walked to the parking lot
p172
aVto take my car and drive home
p173
aVwhen I did something that I don't usually do.
p174
aVI walked through the emergency department on my way home.
p175
aVAnd it was there that another nurse,
p176
aVnot the nurse who was looking after Mrs. Drucker before, but another nurse,
p177
aVsaid three words to me
p178
aVthat are the three words
p179
aVthat most emergency physicians I know dread.
p180
aVOthers in medicine dread them as well,
p181
aVbut there's something particular about emergency medicine
p182
aVbecause we see patients so fleetingly.
p183
aVThe three words are:
p184
aVDo you remember?
p185
aV"Do you remember that patient you sent home?"
p186
aVthe other nurse asked matter-of-factly.
p187
aV"Well she's back,"
p188
aVin just that tone of voice.
p189
aVWell she was back all right.
p190
aVShe was back and near death.
p191
aVAbout an hour after she had arrived home,
p192
aVafter I'd sent her home,
p193
aVshe collapsed and her family called 911
p194
aVand the paramedics brought her back to the emergency department
p195
aVwhere she had a blood pressure of 50,
p196
aVwhich is in severe shock.
p197
aVAnd she was barely breathing and she was blue.
p198
aVAnd the emerg. staff pulled out all the stops.
p199
aVThey gave her medications to raise her blood pressure.
p200
aVThey put her on a ventilator.
p201
aVAnd I was shocked
p202
aVand shaken to the core.
p203
aVAnd I went through this roller coaster,
p204
aVbecause after they stabilized her,
p205
aVshe went to the intensive care unit,
p206
aVand I hoped against hope that she would recover.
p207
aVAnd over the next two or three days,
p208
aVit was clear that she was never going to wake up.
p209
aVShe had irreversible brain damage.
p210
aVAnd the family gathered.
p211
aVAnd over the course of the next eight or nine days,
p212
aVthey resigned themselves to what was happening.
p213
aVAnd at about the nine day mark, they let her go \u2014
p214
aVMrs. Drucker,
p215
aVa wife, a mother
p216
aVand a grandmother.
p217
aVThey say you never forget the names
p218
aVof those who die.
p219
aVAnd that was my first time to be acquainted with that.
p220
aVOver the next few weeks,
p221
aVI beat myself up
p222
aVand I experienced for the first time
p223
aVthe unhealthy shame that exists
p224
aVin our culture of medicine \u2014
p225
aVwhere I felt alone, isolated,
p226
aVnot feeling the healthy kind of shame that you feel,
p227
aVbecause you can't talk about it with your colleagues.
p228
aVYou know that healthy kind,
p229
aVwhen you betray a secret that a best friend made you promise never to reveal
p230
aVand then you get busted
p231
aVand then your best friend confronts you
p232
aVand you have terrible discussions,
p233
aVbut at the end of it all that sick feeling guides you
p234
aVand you say, I'll never make that mistake again.
p235
aVAnd you make amends and you never make that mistake again.
p236
aVThat's the kind of shame that is a teacher.
p237
aVThe unhealthy shame I'm talking about
p238
aVis the one that makes you so sick inside.
p239
aVIt's the one that says,
p240
aVnot that what you did was bad,
p241
aVbut that you are bad.
p242
aVAnd it was what I was feeling.
p243
aVAnd it wasn't because of my attending; he was a doll.
p244
aVHe talked to the family, and I'm quite sure that he smoothed things over
p245
aVand made sure that I didn't get sued.
p246
aVAnd I kept asking myself these questions.
p247
aVWhy didn't I ask my attending? Why did I send her home?
p248
aVAnd then at my worst moments:
p249
aVWhy did I make such a stupid mistake?
p250
aVWhy did I go into medicine?
p251
aVSlowly but surely,
p252
aVit lifted.
p253
aVI began to feel a bit better.
p254
aVAnd on a cloudy day,
p255
aVthere was a crack in the clouds and the sun started to come out
p256
aVand I wondered,
p257
aVmaybe I could feel better again.
p258
aVAnd I made myself a bargain
p259
aVthat if only I redouble my efforts to be perfect
p260
aVand never make another mistake again,
p261
aVplease make the voices stop.
p262
aVAnd they did.
p263
aVAnd I went back to work.
p264
aVAnd then it happened again.
p265
aVTwo years later I was an attending in the emergency department
p266
aVat a community hospital just north of Toronto,
p267
aVand I saw a 25 year-old man with a sore throat.
p268
aVIt was busy, I was in a bit of a hurry.
p269
aVHe kept pointing here.
p270
aVI looked at his throat, it was a little bit pink.
p271
aVAnd I gave him a prescription for penicillin
p272
aVand sent him on his way.
p273
aVAnd even as he was walking out the door,
p274
aVhe was still sort of pointing to his throat.
p275
aVAnd two days later I came to do my next emergency shift,
p276
aVand that's when my chief asked to speak to me quietly in her office.
p277
aVAnd she said the three words:
p278
aVDo you remember?
p279
aV"Do you remember that patient you saw with the sore throat?"
p280
aVWell it turns out, he didn't have a strep throat.
p281
aVHe had a potentially life-threatening condition
p282
aVcalled epiglottitis.
p283
aVYou can Google it,
p284
aVbut it's an infection, not of the throat, but of the upper airway,
p285
aVand it can actually cause the airway to close.
p286
aVAnd fortunately he didn't die.
p287
aVHe was placed on intravenous antibiotics
p288
aVand he recovered after a few days.
p289
aVAnd I went through the same period of shame and recriminations
p290
aVand felt cleansed and went back to work,
p291
aVuntil it happened again and again and again.
p292
aVTwice in one emergency shift, I missed appendicitis.
p293
aVNow that takes some doing,
p294
aVespecially when you work in a hospital
p295
aVthat at the time saw but 14 people a night.
p296
aVNow in both cases, I didn't send them home
p297
aVand I don't think there was any gap in their care.
p298
aVOne I thought had a kidney stone.
p299
aVI ordered a kidney X-ray. When it turned out to be normal,
p300
aVmy colleague who was doing a reassessment of the patient
p301
aVnoticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant and called the surgeons.
p302
aVThe other one had a lot of diarrhea.
p303
aVI ordered some fluids to rehydrate him
p304
aVand asked my colleague to reassess him.
p305
aVAnd he did
p306
aVand when he noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant, called the surgeons.
p307
aVIn both cases,
p308
aVthey had their operations and they did okay.
p309
aVBut each time,
p310
aVthey were gnawing at me, eating at me.
p311
aVAnd I'd like to be able to say to you
p312
aVthat my worst mistakes only happened in the first five years of practice
p313
aVas many of my colleagues say, which is total B.S.
p314
aV(Laughter)
p315
aVSome of my doozies have been in the last five years.
p316
aVAlone, ashamed and unsupported.
p317
aVHere's the problem:
p318
aVIf I can't come clean
p319
aVand talk about my mistakes,
p320
aVif I can't find the still-small voice
p321
aVthat tells me what really happened,
p322
aVhow can I share it with my colleagues?
p323
aVHow can I teach them about what I did
p324
aVso that they don't do the same thing?
p325
aVIf I were to walk into a room \u2014
p326
aVlike right now, I have no idea what you think of me.
p327
aVWhen was the last time you heard somebody talk
p328
aVabout failure after failure after failure?
p329
aVOh yeah, you go to a cocktail party
p330
aVand you might hear about some other doctor,
p331
aVbut you're not going to hear somebody
p332
aVtalking about their own mistakes.
p333
aVIf I were to walk into a room filled with my colleages
p334
aVand ask for their support right now
p335
aVand start to tell what I've just told you right now,
p336
aVI probably wouldn't get through two of those stories
p337
aVbefore they would start to get really uncomfortable,
p338
aVsomebody would crack a joke,
p339
aVthey'd change the subject and we would move on.
p340
aVAnd in fact, if I knew and my colleagues knew
p341
aVthat one of my orthopedic colleagues took off the wrong leg in my hospital,
p342
aVbelieve me, I'd have trouble
p343
aVmaking eye contact with that person.
p344
aVThat's the system that we have.
p345
aVIt's a complete denial of mistakes.
p346
aVIt's a system
p347
aVin which there are two kinds of physicians \u2014
p348
aVthose who make mistakes
p349
aVand those who don't,
p350
aVthose who can't handle sleep deprivation and those who can,
p351
aVthose who have lousy outcomes
p352
aVand those who have great outcomes.
p353
aVAnd it's almost like an ideological reaction,
p354
aVlike the antibodies begin to attack that person.
p355
aVAnd we have this idea
p356
aVthat if we drive the people who make mistakes
p357
aVout of medicine,
p358
aVwhat will we be left with, but a safe system.
p359
aVBut there are two problems with that.
p360
aVIn my 20 years or so
p361
aVof medical broadcasting and journalism,
p362
aVI've made a personal study of medical malpractice and medical errors
p363
aVto learn everything I can,
p364
aVfrom one of the first articles I wrote for the Toronto Star
p365
aVto my show "White Coat, Black Art."
p366
aVAnd what I've learned
p367
aVis that errors are absolutely ubiquitous.
p368
aVWe work in a system
p369
aVwhere errors happen every day,
p370
aVwhere one in 10 medications
p371
aVare either the wrong medication given in hospital
p372
aVor at the wrong dosage,
p373
aVwhere hospital-acquired infections are getting more and more numerous,
p374
aVcausing havoc and death.
p375
aVIn this country,
p376
aVas many as 24,000 Canadians die
p377
aVof preventable medical errors.
p378
aVIn the United States, the Institute of Medicine pegged it at 100,000.
p379
aVIn both cases, these are gross underestimates,
p380
aVbecause we really aren't ferreting out the problem
p381
aVas we should.
p382
aVAnd here's the thing.
p383
aVIn a hospital system
p384
aVwhere medical knowledge is doubling
p385
aVevery two or three years, we can't keep up with it.
p386
aVSleep deprivation is absolutely pervasive.
p387
aVWe can't get rid of it.
p388
aVWe have our cognitive biases,
p389
aVso that I can take a perfect history on a patient with chest pain.
p390
aVNow take the same patient with chest pain,
p391
aVmake them moist and garrulous
p392
aVand put a little bit of alcohol on their breath,
p393
aVand suddenly my history is laced with contempt.
p394
aVI don't take the same history.
p395
aVI'm not a robot;
p396
aVI don't do things the same way each time.
p397
aVAnd my patients aren't cars;
p398
aVthey don't tell me their symptoms in the same way each time.
p399
aVGiven all of that, mistakes are inevitable.
p400
aVSo if you take the system, as I was taught,
p401
aVand weed out all the error-prone health professionals,
p402
aVwell there won't be anybody left.
p403
aVAnd you know that business
p404
aVabout people not wanting
p405
aVto talk about their worst cases?
p406
aVOn my show, on "White Coat, Black Art,"
p407
aVI made it a habit of saying, "Here's my worst mistake,"
p408
aVI would say to everybody
p409
aVfrom paramedics to the chief of cardiac surgery,
p410
aV"Here's my worst mistake," blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
p411
aV"What about yours?" and I would point the microphone towards them.
p412
aVAnd their pupils would dilate,
p413
aVthey would recoil,
p414
aVthen they would look down and swallow hard
p415
aVand start to tell me their stories.
p416
aVThey want to tell their stories. They want to share their stories.
p417
aVThey want to be able to say,
p418
aV"Look, don't make the same mistake I did."
p419
aVWhat they need is an environment to be able to do that.
p420
aVWhat they need is a redefined medical culture.
p421
aVAnd it starts with one physician at a time.
p422
aVThe redefined physician is human,
p423
aVknows she's human,
p424
aVaccepts it, isn't proud of making mistakes,
p425
aVbut strives to learn one thing
p426
aVfrom what happened
p427
aVthat she can teach to somebody else.
p428
aVShe shares her experience with others.
p429
aVShe's supportive when other people talk about their mistakes.
p430
aVAnd she points out other people's mistakes,
p431
aVnot in a gotcha way,
p432
aVbut in a loving, supportive way
p433
aVso that everybody can benefit.
p434
aVAnd she works in a culture of medicine
p435
aVthat acknowledges
p436
aVthat human beings run the system,
p437
aVand when human beings run the system, they will make mistakes from time to time.
p438
aVSo the system is evolving
p439
aVto create backups
p440
aVthat make it easier to detect those mistakes
p441
aVthat humans inevitably make
p442
aVand also fosters in a loving, supportive way
p443
aVplaces where everybody who is observing
p444
aVin the health care system
p445
aVcan actually point out things that could be potential mistakes
p446
