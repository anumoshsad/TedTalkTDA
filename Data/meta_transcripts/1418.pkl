VToday, I'd like to talk with you
p4
aVabout something that should be a totally uncontroversial topic.
p5
aVBut, unfortunately, it's become incredibly controversial.
p6
aa(lp7
VThis year, if you think about it,
p8
aVover a billion couples will have sex with one another.
p9
aVCouples like this one,
p10
aVand this one,
p11
aVand this one,
p12
aVand, yes,
p13
aVeven this one.
p14
aa(lp15
V(Laughter)
p16
aa(lp17
VAnd my idea is this \u2014
p18
aVall these men and women should be free to decide
p19
aVwhether they do or do not want to conceive a child.
p20
aVAnd they should be able to use one of these birth control methods
p21
aVto act on their decision.
p22
aVNow, I think you'd have a hard time
p23
aVfinding many people who disagree with this idea.
p24
aVOver one billion people use birth control without any hesitation at all.
p25
aVThey want the power to plan their own lives
p26
aVand to raise healthier, better educated and more prosperous families.
p27
aa(lp28
VBut, for an idea that is so broadly accepted in private,
p29
aVbirth control certainly generates a lot of opposition in public.
p30
aVSome people think when we talk about contraception
p31
aVthat it's code for abortion,
p32
aVwhich it's not.
p33
aVSome people \u2014 let's be honest \u2014
p34
aVthey're uncomfortable with the topic because it's about sex.
p35
aVSome people worry
p36
aVthat the real goal of family planning is to control populations.
p37
aVThese are all side issues
p38
aVthat have attached themselves to this core idea that men and women
p39
aVshould be able to decide when they want to have a child.
p40
aVAnd as a result, birth control has almost completely and totally disappeared
p41
aVfrom the global health agenda.
p42
aa(lp43
VThe victims of this paralysis are the people of sub-Saharan Africa
p44
aVand South Asia.
p45
aVHere in Germany, the proportion of people that use contraception
p46
aVis about 66 percent.
p47
aVThat's about what you'd expect.
p48
aVIn El Salvador, very similar, 66 percent.
p49
aVThailand, 64 percent.
p50
aVBut let's compare that to other places,
p51
aVlike Uttar Pradesh, one of the largest states in India.
p52
aVIn fact, if Uttar Pradesh was its own country,
p53
aVit would be the fifth largest country in the world.
p54
aVTheir contraception rate \u2014 29 percent.
p55
aVNigeria, the most populous country in Africa, 10 percent.
p56
aVChad, 2 percent.
p57
aVLet's just take one country in Africa, Senegal.
p58
aVTheir rate is about 12 percent.
p59
aa(lp60
VBut why is it so low?
p61
aVOne reason is that the most popular contraceptives are rarely available.
p62
aVWomen in Africa will tell you over and over again
p63
aVthat what they prefer today is an injectable.
p64
aVThey get it in their arm \u2014 and they go about four times a year,
p65
aVthey have to get it every three months \u2014 to get their injection.
p66
aVThe reason women like it so much in Africa is they can hide it from their husbands,
p67
aVwho sometimes want a lot of children.
p68
aVThe problem is every other time a woman goes into a clinic in Senegal,
p69
aVthat injection is stocked out.
p70
aVIt's stocked out 150 days out of the year.
p71
aVSo can you imagine the situation \u2014
p72
aVshe walks all this way to go get her injection.
p73
aVShe leaves her field, sometimes leaves her children,
p74
aVand it's not there.
p75
aVAnd she doesn't know when it's going to be available again.
p76
aVThis is the same story across the continent of Africa today.
p77
aa(lp78
VAnd so what we've created as a world has become a life-and-death crisis.
p79
aVThere are 100,000 women [per year] who say they don't want to be pregnant
p80
aVand they die in childbirth \u2014 100,000 women a year.
p81
aVThere are another 600,000 women [per year]
p82
aVwho say they didn't want to be pregnant in the first place,
p83
aVand they give birth to a baby
p84
aVand her baby dies in that first month of life.
p85
aVI know everyone wants to save these mothers and these children.
p86
aVBut somewhere along the way, we got confused by our own conversation.
p87
aVAnd we stopped trying to save these lives.
p88
aa(lp89
VSo if we're going to make progress on this issue,
p90
aVwe have to be really clear about what our agenda is.
p91
aVWe're not talking about abortion.
p92
aVWe're not talking about population control.
p93
aVWhat I'm talking about is giving women the power to save their lives,
p94
aVto save their children's lives
p95
aVand to give their families the best possible future.
p96
aa(lp97
VNow, as a world,
p98
aVthere are lots of things we have to do in the global health community
p99
aVif we want to make the world better in the future \u2014
p100
aVthings like fight diseases.
p101
aVSo many children today die of diarrhea, as you heard earlier, and pneumonia.
p102
aVThey kill literally millions of children a year.
p103
aVWe also need to help small farmers \u2014
p104
aVfarmers who plow small plots of land in Africa \u2014
p105
aVso that they can grow enough food to feed their children.
p106
aVAnd we have to make sure that children are educated around the world.
p107
aVBut one of the simplest and most transformative things we can do
p108
aVis to give everybody access to birth control methods
p109
aVthat almost all Germans have access to and all Americans, at some point,
p110
aVthey use these tools during their life.
p111
aVAnd I think as long as we're really clear about what our agenda is,
p112
aVthere's a global movement waiting to happen
p113
aVand ready to get behind this totally uncontroversial idea.
p114
aa(lp115
VWhen I grew up, I grew up in a Catholic home.
p116
aVI still consider myself a practicing Catholic.
p117
aVMy mom's great-uncle was a Jesuit priest.
p118
aVMy great-aunt was a Dominican nun.
p119
aVShe was a schoolteacher and a principal her entire life.
p120
aVIn fact, she's the one who taught me as a young girl how to read.
p121
aVI was very close to her.
p122
aVAnd I went to Catholic schools for my entire childhood
p123
aVuntil I left home to go to university.
p124
aVIn my high school, Ursuline Academy,
p125
aVthe nuns made service and social justice a high priority in the school.
p126
aVToday, in the [Gates] Foundation's work,
p127
aVI believe I'm applying the lessons that I learned in high school.
p128
aa(lp129
VSo, in the tradition of Catholic scholars,
p130
aVthe nuns also taught us to question received teachings.
p131
aVAnd one of the teachings that we girls and my peers questioned
p132
aVwas is birth control really a sin?
p133
aVBecause I think one of the reasons
p134
aVwe have this huge discomfort talking about contraception
p135
aVis this lingering concern
p136
aVthat if we separate sex from reproduction, we're going to promote promiscuity.
p137
aVAnd I think that's a reasonable question to be asked about contraception \u2014
p138
aVwhat is its impact on sexual morality?
p139
aa(lp140
VBut, like most women,
p141
aVmy decision about birth control had nothing to do with promiscuity.
p142
aVI had a plan for my future. I wanted to go to college.
p143
aVI studied really hard in college,
p144
aVand I was proud to be one of the very few female computer science graduates
p145
aVat my university.
p146
aVI wanted to have a career, so I went on to business school
p147
aVand I became one of the youngest female executives at Microsoft.
p148
aa(lp149
VI still remember, though, when I left my parents' home
p150
aVto move across the country to start this new job at Microsoft.
p151
aVThey had sacrificed a lot to give me five years of higher education.
p152
aVBut they said, as I left home \u2014
p153
aVand I literally went down the front steps, down the porch at home \u2014
p154
aVand they said,
p155
aV"Even though you've had this great education,
p156
aVif you decide to get married and have kids right away,
p157
aVthat's OK by us, too."
p158
aVThey wanted me to do the thing that would make me the very happiest.
p159
aVI was free to decide what that would be.
p160
aVIt was an amazing feeling.
p161
aa(lp162
VIn fact, I did want to have kids \u2014
p163
aVbut I wanted to have them when I was ready.
p164
aVAnd so now, Bill and I have three.
p165
aVAnd when our eldest daughter was born,
p166
aVwe weren't, I would say, exactly sure how to be great parents.
p167
aVMaybe some of you know that feeling.
p168
aVAnd so we waited a little while before we had our second child.
p169
aVAnd it's no accident that we have three children
p170
aVthat are spaced three years apart.
p171
aVNow, as a mother, what do I want the very most for my children?
p172
aVI want them to feel the way I did \u2014
p173
aVlike they can do anything they want to do in life.
p174
aVAnd so, what has struck me
p175
aVas I've travelled the last decade for the foundation around the world
p176
aVis that all women want that same thing.
p177
aa(lp178
VLast year, I was in Nairobi, in the slums, in one called Korogocho \u2014
p179
aVwhich literally means when translated, "standing shoulder to shoulder."
p180
aVAnd I spoke with this women's group that's pictured here.
p181
aVAnd the women talked very openly about their family life in the slums,
p182
aVwhat it was like.
p183
aVAnd they talked quite intimately about what they did for birth control.
p184
aVMarianne, in the center of the screen in the red sweater,
p185
aVshe summed up that entire two-hour conversation
p186
aVin a phrase that I will never forget.
p187
aVShe said, "I want to bring every good thing to this child
p188
aVbefore I have another."
p189
aVAnd I thought \u2014 that's it.
p190
aVThat's universal.
p191
aVWe all want to bring every good thing to our children.
p192
aa(lp193
VBut what's not universal is our ability to provide every good thing.
p194
aVSo many women suffer from domestic violence.
p195
aVAnd they can't even broach the subject of contraception,
p196
aVeven inside their own marriage.
p197
aVThere are many women who lack basic education.
p198
aVEven many of the women who do have knowledge and do have power
p199
aVdon't have access to contraceptives.
p200
aa(lp201
VFor 250 years, parents around the world
p202
aVhave been deciding to have smaller families.
p203
aVThis trend has been steady for a quarter of a millennium,
p204
aVacross cultures and across geographies,
p205
aVwith the glaring exception of sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.
p206
aVThe French started bringing down their family size in the mid-1700s.
p207
aVAnd over the next 150 years, this trend spread all across Europe.
p208
aVThe surprising thing to me, as I learned this history,
p209
aVwas that it spread not along socioeconomic lines but around cultural lines.
p210
aVPeople who spoke the same language made that change as a group.
p211
aVThey made the same choice for their family,
p212
aVwhether they were rich or whether they were poor.
p213
aVThe reason that trend toward smaller families spread
p214
aVwas that this whole way was driven by an idea \u2014
p215
aVthe idea that couples can exercise conscious control
p216
aVover how many children they have.
p217
aVThis is a very powerful idea.
p218
aVIt means that parents have the ability to affect the future,
p219
aVnot just accept it as it is.
p220
aa(lp221
VIn France, the average family size went down every decade
p222
aVfor 150 years in a row until it stabilized.
p223
aVIt took so long back then because the contraceptives weren't that good.
p224
aVIn Germany, this transition started in the 1880s, and it took just 50 years
p225
aVfor family size to stabilize in this country.
p226
aVAnd in Asia and Latin America, the transition started in the 1960s,
p227
aVand it happened much faster because of modern contraception.
p228
aa(lp229
VI think, as we go through this history, it's important to pause for a moment
p230
aVand to remember why this has become such a contentious issue.
p231
aVIt's because some family planning programs
p232
aVresorted to unfortunate incentives and coercive policies.
p233
aVFor instance, in the 1960s, India adopted very specific numeric targets
p234
aVand they paid women to accept having an IUD placed in their bodies.
p235
aVNow, Indian women were really smart in this situation.
p236
aVWhen they went to get an IUD inserted, they got paid six rupees.
p237
aVAnd so what did they do?
p238
aVThey waited a few hours or a few days,
p239
aVand they went to another service provider and had the IUD removed for one rupee.
p240
aVFor decades in the United States,
p241
aVAfrican-American women were sterilized without their consent.
p242
aVThe procedure was so common
p243
aVit became known as the Mississippi appendectomy \u2014
p244
aVa tragic chapter in my country's history.
p245
aVAnd as recently as the 1990s, in Peru,
p246
aVwomen from the Andes region were given anesthesia
p247
aVand they were sterilized without their knowledge.
p248
aa(lp249
VThe most startling thing about this
p250
aVis that these coercive policies weren't even needed.
p251
aVThey were carried out in places
p252
aVwhere parents already wanted to lower their family size.
p253
aVBecause in region after region, again and again,
p254
aVparents have wanted to have smaller families.
p255
aVThere's no reason to believe
p256
aVthat African women have innately different desires.
p257
aVGiven the option, they will have fewer children.
p258
aVThe question is:
p259
aVwill we invest in helping all women get what they want now?
p260
aVOr, are we going to condemn them to some century-long struggle,
p261
aVas if this was still revolutionary France
p262
aVand the best method was coitus interruptus?
p263
aa(lp264
VEmpowering parents \u2014 it doesn't need justification.
p265
aVBut here's the thing \u2014 our desire to bring every good thing to our children
p266
aVis a force for good throughout the world.
p267
aVIt's what propels societies forward.
p268
aVIn that same slum in Nairobi, I met a young businesswoman,
p269
aVand she was making backpacks out of her home.
p270
aVShe and her young kids would go to the local jeans factory
p271
aVand collect scraps of denim.
p272
aVShe'd create these backpacks and resell them.
p273
aVAnd when I talked with her, she had three children,
p274
aVand I asked her about her family.
p275
aVAnd she said she and her husband decided
p276
aVthat they wanted to stop having children after their third one.
p277
aVAnd so when I asked her why, she simply said,
p278
aV"Well, because I couldn't run my business if I had another child."
p279
aVAnd she explained the income that she was getting out of her business
p280
aVafforded her to be able to give an education to all three of her children.
p281
aVShe was incredibly optimistic about her family's future.
p282
aVThis is the same mental calculus
p283
aVthat hundreds of millions of men and women have gone through.
p284
aVAnd evidence proves that they have it exactly right.
p285
aVThey are able to give their children more opportunities
p286
aVby exercising control over when they have them.
p287
aa(lp288
VIn Bangladesh,
p289
aVthere's a district called Matlab.
p290
aVIt's where researchers have collected data on over 180,000 inhabitants since 1963.
p291
aVIn the global health community,
p292
aVwe like to say it's one of the longest pieces of research that's been running.
p293
aVWe have so many great health statistics.
p294
aVIn one of the studies, what did they do?
p295
aVHalf the villagers were chosen to get contraceptives.
p296
aVThey got education and access to contraception.
p297
aVTwenty years later, following those villages,
p298
aVwhat we learned is that they had a better quality of life than their neighbors.
p299
aVThe families were healthier.
p300
aVThe women were less likely to die in childbirth.
p301
aVTheir children were less likely to die in the first thirty days of life.
p302
aVThe children were better nourished.
p303
aVThe families were also wealthier.
p304
aVThe adult women's wages were higher.
p305
aVHouseholds had more assets \u2014 things like livestock or land or savings.
p306
aVFinally, their sons and daughters had more schooling.
p307
aVSo when you multiply these types of effects over millions of families,
p308
aVthe product can be large-scale economic development.
p309
aVPeople talk about the Asian economic miracle of the 1980s \u2014
p310
aVbut it wasn't really a miracle.
p311
aVOne of the leading causes of economic growth across that region
p312
aVwas this cultural trend towards smaller families.
p313
aa(lp314
VSweeping changes start at the individual family level \u2014
p315
aVthe family making a decision about what's best for their children.
p316
aVWhen they make that change and that decision,
p317
aVthose become sweeping regional and national trends.
p318
aVWhen families in sub-Saharan Africa are given the opportunity
p319
aVto make those decisions for themselves,
p320
aVI think it will help spark a virtuous cycle of development
p321
aVin communities across the continent.
p322
aVWe can help poor families build a better future.
p323
aVWe can insist that all people have the opportunity
p324
aVto learn about contraceptives
p325
aVand have access to the full variety of methods.
p326
aa(lp327
VI think the goal here is really clear:
p328
aVuniversal access to birth control that women want.
p329
aVAnd for that to happen, it means that both rich and poor governments alike
p330
aVmust make contraception a total priority.
p331
aVWe can do our part, in this room and globally,
p332
aVby talking about the hundreds of millions of families
p333
aVthat don't have access to contraception today
p334
aVand what it would do to change their lives if they did have access.
p335
aa(lp336
VI think if Marianne and the members of her women's group
p337
aVcan talk about this openly
p338
aVand have this discussion out amongst themselves and in public,
p339
aVwe can, too.
p340
aVAnd we need to start now.
p341
aVBecause like Marianne, we all want to bring every good thing to our children.
p342
aVAnd where is the controversy in that?
p343
aVThank you.
p344
aa(lp345
V(Applause)
p346
aa(lp347
VChris Anderson: Thank you.
p348
aVI have some questions for Melinda.
p349
aa(lp350
V(Applause ends)
p351
aa(lp352
VThank you for your courage and everything else.
p353
aa(lp354
VSo, Melinda, in the last few years
p355
aVI've heard a lot of smart people say something to the effect of,
p356
aV"We don't need to worry about the population issue anymore.
p357
aVFamily sizes are coming down naturally all over the world.
p358
aVWe're going to peak at nine or 10 billion. And that's it."
p359
aVAre they wrong?
p360
aa(lp361
VMelinda Gates: If you look at the statistics across Africa,
p362
aVthey are wrong.
p363
aVAnd I think we need to look at it, though, from a different lens.
p364
aVWe need to look at it from the ground upwards.
p365
aVI think that's one of the reasons we got ourselves in so much trouble
p366
aVon this issue of contraception.
p367
aVWe looked at it from top down
p368
aVand said we want to have different population numbers over time.
p369
aVYes, we care about the planet. Yes, we need to make the right choices.
p370
aVBut the choices have to be made at the family level.
p371
aVAnd it's only by giving people access and letting them choose what to do
p372
aVthat you get those sweeping changes that we have seen globally \u2014
p373
aVexcept for sub-Saharan Africa and those places in South Asia and Afghanistan.
p374
aa(lp375
VCA: Some people on the right in America
p376
aVand in many conservative cultures around the world
p377
aVmight say something like this:
p378
aV"It's all very well to talk about saving lives and empowering women and so on.
p379
aVBut, sex is sacred.
p380
aVWhat you're proposing is going to increase the likelihood
p381
aVthat lots of sex happens outside marriage.
p382
aVAnd that is wrong."
p383
aVWhat would you say to them?
p384
aa(lp385
VMG: I would say that sex is absolutely sacred.
p386
aVAnd it's sacred in Germany, and it's sacred in the United States,
p387
aVand it's sacred in France and so many places around the world.
p388
aVAnd the fact that 98 percent of women in my country who are sexually experienced
p389
aVsay they use birth control doesn't make sex any less sacred.
p390
aVIt just means that they're getting to make choices about their lives.
p391
aVAnd I think in that choice,
p392
aVwe're also honoring the sacredness of the family
p393
aVand the sacredness of the mother's life
p394
aVand the childrens' lives by saving their lives.
p395
aVTo me, that's incredibly sacred, too.
p396
aa(lp397
VCA: So what is your foundation doing to promote this issue?
p398
aVAnd what could people here and people listening on the web \u2014
p399
aVwhat would you like them to do?
p400
aa(lp401
VMG: I would say this \u2014 join the conversation.
p402
aVWe've listed the website up here. Join the conversation.
p403
aVTell your story about how contraception has either changed your life
p404
aVor somebody's life that you know.
p405
aVAnd say that you're for this.
p406
aVWe need a groundswell of people saying, "This makes sense.
p407
aVWe've got to give all women access \u2014 no matter where they live."
p408
aVAnd one of the things that we're going to do
p409
aVis do a large event July 11 in London,
p410
aVwith a whole host of countries, a whole host of African nations,
p411
aVto all say we're putting this back on the global health agenda.
p412
aVWe're going to commit resources to it,
p413
aVand we're going to do planning from the bottom up with governments
p414
aVto make sure that women are educated \u2014
p415
aVso that if they want the tool, they have it,
p416
aVand that they have lots of options available
p417
aVeither through their local healthcare worker
p418
aVor their local community rural clinic.
p419
aa(lp420
VCA: Melinda, I'm guessing that some of those nuns who taught you at school
p421
aVare going to see this TED Talk at some point.
p422

VMG: I know they're going to see the TED Talk
p425
aVbecause they know that I'm doing it and I plan to send it to them.
p426
aVAnd, you know, the nuns who taught me were incredibly progressive.
p427
aVI hope that they'll be very proud of me
p428
aVfor living out what they taught us about social justice and service.
p429
aVI have come to feel incredibly passionate about this issue
p430
aVbecause of what I've seen in the developing world.
p431
aVAnd for me, this topic has become very close to heart
p432
aVbecause you meet these women and they are so often voiceless.
p433
aVAnd yet they shouldn't be \u2014
p434
aVthey should have a voice, they should have access.
p435
aVAnd so I hope they'll feel
p436
aVthat I'm living out what I've learned from them
p437
aVand from the decades of work that I've already done at the foundation.

p447
aVYou heard the discussion about the journey through energy,
p448
aVor the journey through social design,
p449
aVor the journey in the coming and saying,
p450
aV"Why aren't there any women on this platform?"
p451
aVAnd I think for all of us who work on these development issues,
p452
aVyou learn by talking to other people.
p453
aVYou learn by doing. You learn by trying and making mistakes.
p454
aVAnd it's the questions you ask.
p455
aVSometimes it's the questions you ask that helps lead to the answer
p456
aVthe next person that can help you answer it.
p457
aVSo I have lots of questions for the panelists from today.
