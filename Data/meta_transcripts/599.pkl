VI have a studio in Berlin \u2014
p4
aVlet me cue on here \u2014
p5
aVwhich is down there in this snow, just last weekend.
p6
aVIn the studio we do a lot of experiments.
p7
aVI would consider the studio more like a laboratory.
p8
aVI have occasional meetings with scientists.
p9
aVAnd I have an academy, a part of the University of Fine Arts in Berlin.
p10
aVWe have an annual gathering of people,
p11
aVand that is called Life in Space.
p12
aVLife in Space is really not necessarily about
p13
aVhow we do things, but why we do things.
p14
aa(lp15
VDo you mind looking, with me, at that little cross in the center there?
p16
aVSo just keep looking. Don't mind me.
p17
aVSo you will have a yellow circle, and we will do an after-image experiment.
p18
aVWhen the circle goes away you will have another color, the complementary color.
p19
aVI am saying something. And your eyes and your brain are saying something back.
p20
aVThis whole idea of sharing, the idea of constituting reality
p21
aVby overlapping what I say and what you say \u2014
p22
aVthink of a movie.
p23
aa(lp24
VSince two years now, with some stipends from the science ministry in Berlin,
p25
aVI've been working on these films
p26
aVwhere we produce the film together.
p27
aVI don't necessarily think the film is so interesting.
p28
aVObviously this is not interesting at all in the sense of the narrative.
p29
aVBut nevertheless, what the potential is \u2014
p30
aVand just keep looking there \u2014
p31
aVwhat the potential is, obviously,
p32
aVis to kind of move the border of who is the author,
p33
aVand who is the receiver.
p34
aVWho is the consumer, if you want,
p35
aVand who has responsibility for what one sees?
p36
aVI think there is a socializing dimension
p37
aVin, kind of, moving that border.
p38
aVWho decides what reality is?
p39
aa(lp40
VThis is the Tate Modern in London.
p41
aVThe show was, in a sense, about that.
p42
aVIt was about a space in which I put half a semi-circular yellow disk.
p43
aVI also put a mirror in the ceiling, and some fog, some haze.
p44
aVAnd my idea was to make the space tangible.
p45
aVWith such a big space, the problem is
p46
aVobviously that there is a discrepancy
p47
aVbetween what your body can embrace,
p48
aVand what the space, in that sense, is.
p49
aVSo here I had the hope that by inserting some natural elements,
p50
aVif you want \u2014 some fog \u2014 I could make the space tangible.
p51
aa(lp52
VAnd what happens is that people, they start to see themselves in this space.
p53
aVSo look at this. Look at the girl.
p54
aVOf course they have to look through a bloody camera
p55
aVin a museum. Right? That's how museums are working today.
p56
aVBut look at her face there,
p57
aVas she's checking out, looking at herself in the mirror.
p58
aV"Oh! That was my foot there!"
p59
aVShe wasn't really sure whether she was seeing herself or not.
p60
aVAnd in that whole idea,
p61
aVhow do we configure the relationship between our body and the space?
p62
aVHow do we reconfigure it?
p63
aVHow do we know that being in a space makes a difference?
p64
aa(lp65
VDo you see when I said in the beginning, it's about
p66
aVwhy, rather than how?
p67
aVThe why meant really,
p68
aV"What consequences does it have when I take a step?"
p69
aV"What does it matter?"
p70
aV"Does it matter if I am in the world or not?"
p71
aV"And does it matter whether the kind of actions I take
p72
aVfilter into a sense of responsibility?"
p73
aVIs art about that?
p74
aVI would say yes. It is obviously about
p75
aVnot just about decorating the world, and making it look even better,
p76
aVor even worse, if you ask me.
p77
aa(lp78
VIt's obviously also about taking responsibility,
p79
aVlike I did here when throwing some green dye in the river
p80
aVin L.A., Stockholm, Norway and Tokyo,
p81
aVamong other places.
p82
aVThe green dye is not environmentally dangerous,
p83
aVbut it obviously looks really rather frightening.
p84
aVAnd it's on the other side also, I think, quite beautiful,
p85
aVas it somehow shows the turbulence in these kind of downtown areas,
p86
aVin these different places of the world.
p87
aa(lp88
VThe "Green river," as a kind of activist idea, not a part of an exhibition,
p89
aVit was really about showing people,
p90
aVin this city, as they walk by,
p91
aVthat space has dimensions. A space has time.
p92
aVAnd the water flows through the city with time.
p93
aVThe water has an ability to make
p94
aVthe city negotiable, tangible.
p95
aVNegotiable meaning that it makes a difference
p96
aVwhether you do something or not.
p97
aVIt makes a difference whether you say, "I'm a part of this city.
p98
aVAnd if I vote it makes a difference.
p99
aVIf I take a stand, it makes a difference."
p100
aa(lp101
VThis whole idea of a city not being a picture is,
p102
aVI think, something that art, in a sense,
p103
aValways was working with.
p104
aVThe idea that art can actually evaluate the relationship
p105
aVbetween what it means to be in a picture,
p106
aVand what it means to be in a space. What is the difference?
p107
aVThe difference between thinking and doing.
p108
aVSo these are different experiments with that. I won't go into them.
p109
aVIceland, lower right corner, my favorite place.
p110
aa(lp111
VThese kinds of experiments, they filter into architectural models.
p112
aVThese are ongoing experiments.
p113
aVOne is an experiment I did for BMW,
p114
aVan attempt to make a car.
p115
aVIt's made out of ice.
p116
aVA crystalline stackable principle in the center on the top,
p117
aVwhich I am trying to turn into a concert hall in Iceland.
p118
aVA sort of a run track, or a walk track,
p119
aVon the top of a museum in Denmark,
p120
aVwhich is made of colored glass, going all around.
p121
aVSo the movement with your legs
p122
aVwill change the color of your horizon.
p123
aVAnd two summers ago at the Hyde Park in London,
p124
aVwith the Serpentine Gallery:
p125
aVa kind of a temporal pavilion where
p126
aVmoving was the only way you could see the pavilion.
p127
aVThis summer, in New York:
p128
aVthere is one thing about falling water which is very much about
p129
aVthe time it takes for water to fall.
p130
aVIt's quite simple and fundamental.
p131
aa(lp132
VI've walked a lot in the mountains in Iceland.
p133
aVAnd as you come to a new valley,
p134
aVas you come to a new landscape, you have a certain view.
p135
aVIf you stand still, the landscape
p136
aVdoesn't necessarily tell you how big it is.
p137
aVIt doesn't really tell you what you're looking at.
p138
aVThe moment you start to move, the mountain starts to move.
p139
aVThe big mountains far away, they move less.
p140
aVThe small mountains in the foreground, they move more.
p141
aVAnd if you stop again, you wonder,
p142
aV"Is that a one-hour valley?
p143
aVOr is that a three-hour hike, or is that a whole day I'm looking at?"
p144
aa(lp145
VIf you have a waterfall in there,
p146
aVright out there at the horizon; you look at the waterfall
p147
aVand you go, "Oh, the water is falling really slowly."
p148
aVAnd you go, "My god it's really far away and it's a giant waterfall."
p149
aVIf a waterfall is falling faster,
p150
aVit's a smaller waterfall which is closer by \u2014
p151
aVbecause the speed of falling water is pretty constant everywhere.
p152
aVAnd your body somehow knows that.
p153
aVSo this means a waterfall is a way of measuring space.
p154
aa(lp155
VOf course being an iconic city like New York,
p156
aVthat has had an interest in somehow
p157
aVplaying around with the sense of space, you could say that New York
p158
aVwants to seem as big as possible.
p159
aVAdding a measurement
p160
aVto that is interesting:
p161
aVthe falling water suddenly gives you a sense
p162
aVof, "Oh, Brooklyn is exactly this much \u2014
p163
aVthe distance between Brooklyn and Manhattan, in this case
p164
aVthe lower East River is this big."
p165
aa(lp166
VSo it was not just necessarily about putting nature into the cities.
p167
aVIt was also about giving the city a sense of dimension.
p168
aVAnd why would we want to do that?
p169
aVBecause I think it makes a difference
p170
aVwhether you have a body
p171
aVthat feels a part of a space,
p172
aVrather than having a body which is just in front of a picture.
p173
aVAnd "Ha-ha, there is a picture and here is I. And what does it matter?"
p174
aVIs there a sense of consequences?
p175
aa(lp176
VSo if I have a sense of the space,
p177
aVif I feel that the space is tangible,
p178
aVif I feel there is time,
p179
aVif there is a dimension I could call time,
p180
aVI also feel that I can change the space.
p181
aVAnd suddenly it makes a difference
p182
aVin terms of making space accessible.
p183
aVOne could say this is about
p184
aVcommunity, collectivity.
p185
aVIt's about being together.
p186
aa(lp187
VHow do we create public space?
p188
aVWhat does the word "public" mean today anyway?
p189
aVSo, asked in that way,
p190
aVI think it raises great things about
p191
aVparliamentary ideas, democracy, public space,
p192
aVbeing together, being individual.
p193
aVHow do we create
p194
aVan idea which is both tolerant to individuality,
p195
aVand also to collectivity,
p196
aVwithout polarizing the two
p197
aVinto two different opposites?
p198
aVOf course the political agendas in the world
p199
aVhas been very obsessed, polarizing the two against each other
p200
aVinto different, very normative ideas.
p201
aa(lp202
VI would claim that art and culture,
p203
aVand this is why art and culture are so incredibly interesting
p204
aVin the times we're living in now,
p205
aVhave proven that one can
p206
aVcreate a kind of a space
p207
aVwhich is both sensitive to individuality
p208
aVand to collectivity.
p209
aVIt's very much about this causality, consequences.
p210
aVIt's very much about the way we link
p211
aVthinking and doing.
p212
aVSo what is between thinking and doing?
p213
aVAnd right in-between thinking and doing,
p214
aVI would say, there is experience.
p215
aVAnd experience is not just
p216
aVa kind of entertainment in a non-casual way.
p217
aVExperience is about responsibility.
p218
aVHaving an experience is taking part in the world.
p219
aVTaking part in the world is really about sharing responsibility.
p220
aVSo art, in that sense,
p221
aVI think holds an incredible relevance
p222
aVin the world in which we're moving into,
p223
aVparticularly right now.
p224
aVThat's all I have. Thank you very much.
