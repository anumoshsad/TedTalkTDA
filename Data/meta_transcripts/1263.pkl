VThe story I want to tell you about, started to me,
p4
aVin 1996 when I was studying in England.
p5
aVOne day, I was glancing through my bank statement (I didn't have much to look at)
p6
aVand I've noticed that in the upper corner there was a symbol, that I'm going to show you,
p7
aVsaying that document had been made in plain language, for me to understand it.
p8
aVThe idea interested me; I tried to find out what that was
p9
aVand I found out that there was a campaign for the simplification of language,
p10
aVwhich was the "Plain English Campaign".
p11
aVI thought it was a fabulous idea, for about  one day or two,
p12
aVand I've never thought about it since.
p13
aVWhen I came back to Portugal, for good,
p14
aVI came across with several documents - for example,  my work contract,
p15
aVthe papers I had to sign to buy a house,  the electricity bill \u2014
p16
aVa series of documents that reminded me of  that bank statement.
p17
aVNot because they were equally clear and simple,
p18
aVbut because they were the exact opposite.
p19
aVBecause I had to read everything twice or thrice,  to begin to understand what was written there.
p20
aVAnd then, that little seed that had been sown in 1996, started germinating.
p21
aVAnd one day, I found myself
p22
aVentering through my boss' office and quitting  my job to dedicate myself to this.
p23
aVAnd so, what did I find out, right off the start?
p24
aVI found out that it was a much more severe problem  than I thought.
p25
aVIt wasn't only about these documents being  complex and annoying,
p26
aVit was the fact that Portuguese people's literacy \u2014
p27
aVliteracy is the hability to understand written documents \u2014
p28
aVis extremely low. I'm going to show you a chart about Portuguese people's literacy [rate].
p29
aVYou know that about 10, 11% of people, in Portugal,
p30
aa(lp31
Vdon't know how to read nor write at all, yet.
p32
aVOver there are those who know, or say they know,  how to read and write. So, what do we have?
p33
aVWe have that group of red people in level 1,  which is the lowest in literacy [rate].
p34
aVThey are persons who are able to join letters,
p35
aVbut they can't, actually, understand.
p36
aVFor example, if a person, from that red group,  has to pick up
p37
aVthe package leaflet of a medicinal product,  to give a dose of medicine to his/her child,
p38
aVhe/she can't, can't understand the information.
p39
aV50% of the Portuguese. Then we have 30% more,  those yellow ones,
p40
aVover there, people who get by on the daily basis.
p41
aVThat is, if they don't have to read anything too new  or too different, they will manage.
p42
aVBut, for example, if they work in a factory and  a new machine arrives
p43
aVand they have to read the machine's manual  to be able to work with it, they can't do it anymore.
p44
aVAnd there they go, 80% of the Portuguese people.
p45
aVThen we have a few more that can handle documents,
p46
aVas long as they are not too complex,
p47
aVand we have 5% of the population that  can handle really complex documents.
p48
aVNow, just so you don't think this is normal,  that over there is Sweden.
p49
aVWhile we have 20% of people with the literacy  considered essential for a daily basis,
p50
aVSweden has 75%.
p51
aVAnd looking at that, what did I realize?
p52
aVI realized we live in an apartheid of information.
p53
aVI realized that there's a small minority of people  who has indeed access to information
p54
aVand can use it to their advantage and  a huge majority that can't.
p55
aVAnd because they can't, they are excluded  and they are impaired.
p56
aVLet me give you an example.
p57
aVThat one is Mr. Domingos, my building's doorkeeper. Mr. Domingos started to read at the age of 27,
p58
aVso, he falls in that yellow group that  we have seen a little while ago.
p59
aVFrom time to time, I'm arriving home and he says:
p60
aV"Miss Sandra!"; "Yes, Mr. Domingos."
p61
aV"Here is a little letter." So, the deal is: when Mr. Domingos or someone in the family or in the neighbourhood
p62
aVreceives something that they don't understand,  they come to me and I help them to translate it.
p63
aVAnd so, that time he said to me like this:
p64
aV"Oh, Miss Sandra, I'm about to throw this away,  but check it if this is important."
p65
aVIt was very important. He had been waiting,  for quite a while, to have a knee surgery
p66
aVand that was the letter of the famous surgery-bank checks. When a person is waiting for a long time,
p67
aVthey get a bank check and with that bank check  they can have that surgery in the private sector.
p68
aVIt was almost thrown away into the garbage,  Mr. Domingos' letter.
p69
aVIn that same year, I've found out,
p70
aVonly 20% of people had used these  surgery-bank checks.
p71
aVThe other 80%, I don't believe they had been cured while they were waiting.
p72
aVThey most likely did the same as Mr. Domingos:
p73
aV"Ah! What's this? I'm not understanding,  it's going to the garbage".
p74
aVThey lost the opportunity to have the surgery  they needed.
p75
aVWhat happens here? When people don't understand
p76
aVthis has severe consequences \u2014 to the individual,  but also for the country.
p77
aVWhen I don't understand which are my rights,  the benefits I can have access to,
p78
aVI can't understand my duties and I'm not  an active and participative citizen either.
p79
aVNow, maybe, you are sitting there and thinking:
p80
aV"Yeah, poor Mr. Domingos... Bad luck, isn't it?  Me?! I'm in the green ones."
p81
aV"I'm absolutely sure that I'm one of the green ones.  I was selected to come to TED! Hum?" (Laughter)
p82
aVSo the deal is: I have here some texts to read to you
p83
aVand I'm going to see what color are you  when I finish reading.
p84
aVSo, come on, this is an automobile insurance  contract. It says this:
p85
aV"Unless contrary stipulation, the decease of the ensured person, the ensured capital is provided,
p86
aVin case of predeceasing of the beneficiary relatively to the ensured person, to the heirs of the last,
p87
aVin case of the simultaneous decease of the ensured person and of the beneficiary,
p88
aVto the heirs of the last". Hum? (Laughter)
p89
aVNext, there's another one, from the medicines'  package leaflet, that says the following:
p90
aV"Warning! It may also occur erythema, edema,  vesiculation, keratolysis and urticaria."
p91
aVHum? Are you clear?
p92
aVAnd this one is really good. This one, I signed a renting contract to the new office on Friday
p93
aVand I laughed my head off.
p94
aVSo, it said: "I, as a cosigner, assume the opportune  payment of the rents,
p95
aVwaiving the benefits of the division  and prior foreclosure."
p96
aVWhen I heard "opportune payment" ["storm payment"  in Portuguese], I imagined myself bursting in there,
p97
aVslamming the door and saying: "Here's the money!!!" (Laughter)
p98
aVBut it's not! (Laughter) (Applause)
p99
aVBut it's not! (Applause)
p100
aV(Applause)
p101
aV(Applause)
p102
aVSo, it's this: when we leave our area of expertise \u2014
p103
aVand it only takes a little; there is no need to go  to the string theory or something like that,
p104
aVit only takes a little... (Laughter)
p105
aVWhat happens?
p106
aVWe get as lost as Mr. Domingos.
p107
aVAnd these documents are not written  by experts to experts,
p108
aVas the ones from the string theory.
p109
aVNo! These are documents written for me,  these are the public documents,
p110
aVthe public documents I need to understand  in my daily life,
p111
aVto govern myself, to live my life.
p112
aVThese are the renting contracts, the package leaflet  of the medicines.
p113
aVIt's all this. The electricity bills.
p114
aVThis has to be clear, so that I can understand.
p115
aVBecause, if I can't understand, what happens?
p116
aVI make mistakes, I get wrong.
p117
aVI'm going to give you an example of mistakes that  were committed, bad decisions made
p118
aVfor not being able to understand documents.
p119
aVDo you remember the subprime crisis that  took place in the United States?
p120
aVWhat happened?
p121
aVPeople signed those loans to buy houses,
p122
aVwithout truly understanding what they were signing.
p123
aVBecause if they knew what they were signing,
p124
aVthey'd know that as soon as the interest rate started to rise, the monthly payment would also increase,
p125
aVthey wouldn't be able to pay anymore and  they would end up without a house.
p126
aVSo, the rest, after that, next, everything  crumbled down and we know the rest.
p127
aVDo you think that if there was a culture of clarity  in the financial sector
p128
aVthings would have got up to where they've got?
p129
aVI don't think so. So,
p130
aVhow do you solve this problem,
p131
aVthis such big difference between the  literacy [rate] of the Portuguese,
p132
aVthat is down here, and the complexity  of the public documents,
p133
aVthose ones we need to understand in our daily lives, sorry,
p134
aVthat are up here?
p135
aVSo, the first think that comes to mind is,
p136
aV"If literacy is down here, let's make it rise" \u2014 isn't it?
p137
aVLet's educate people.
p138
aVLet's, let's... of course we will,  of course we will educate people.
p139
aVThe thing is, it's hard and it's slow.  And I don't even want to imagine
p140
aVhow many generations it will take until we are  at Sweden's level.
p141
aVBut, besides that, it's not only because it is slow.  There is another problem.
p142
aVIf the language of the documents  isn't simpler,
p143
aVwe've already seen that people, even with  a high literacy level, like you,
p144
aVif the language is hard, they don't get cleared,
p145
aVthey continue to be unable to understand these documents.
p146
aVSo, besides increasing literacy [rate], and for now,
p147
aVit's much more important to reduce  the complexity of documents
p148
aVand simplify the language.
p149
aVI'm going to show you an example.
p150
aVWhen I talk about simplifying the language.  Notice!
p151
aVOn the left side of a contract:
p152
aV"It is agreed that the insurance company, bla bla bla,  bla bla bla, bla bla..."
p153
aVThis is a before and after example. What do we mean with simplifying language?
p154
aVIt's communicating in a simple and clear way,  enabling our reader to understand it at first glance.
p155
aVWhat do you prefer? Before or after?
p156
aVThere isn't much doubt, is there?
p157
aVSo, how is this achieved? How can you make  the State and companies communicate
p158
aVwith citizens in a language they can understand  at first glance?
p159
aVThere are several ways. There are countries  that are going by the path of legislation.
p160
aVFor example, Sweden and the United States  introduced, last year, a legislation that forces
p161
aVthe State to communicate with people in  a language they can understand.
p162
aVAnd you think, "Well, that's normal.  They are countries that are a bit ahead.
p163
aV"Sweden, maybe, much more than the United States.
p164
aV"But they are countries that are a bit ahead.
p165
aV"It would be nice if in our country there was also  legislation towards that, wouldn't it be?"
p166
aVSo it would. And there is! Since 1999.
p167
aVThe Law of the Administrative Modernization  says that
p168
aVthe communication between the State and the people
p169
aVshould be simple, clear, concise, meaningful,  without acronyms, bla bla bla...
p170
aVBut the thing is: it is not applied. So, the question,
p171
aVthe path of going through legislation,  enforcing through legislation,
p172
aVworks in those countries where laws  are made to be applied.
p173
aVNow, there is another way, the way of marketing.
p174
aVHow does that work? It's like this:
p175
aVprivate companies change their language;  communicate in a clearer and simpler way,
p176
aVthey make a big fuss about it, consumers love it,
p177
aVthe sales rise, it works beautifully.
p178
aVBut it works for the private sector.
p179
aVNow, what is the third path, and to me,  the most important one?
p180
aVIt's the path of civil movements,
p181
aVthat are based in a mentality shift.
p182
aVIn countries where this really went forward \u2014
p183
aVdo you remember the English label, of the "Plain English Campaign"? \u2014
p184
aVthis is all based on a consumers' movement.
p185
aVSo, what does it take for that civic movement  to happen?
p186
aVWe need to understand two very important things:
p187
aVFirst, wanting to understand these  public documents is not a whim,
p188
aVis not an intellectual curiosity.
p189
aVIt is a necessity that I have in my daily life.
p190
aVAnd above all, it is a right, it is everyone's right.
p191
aVOn this side we have: understanding is a right.
p192
aVAnd we have to understand another thing too,
p193
aVwhich is: he who writes, has to write in order  to be understood.
p194
aVHow do we get there?
p195
aVFirst of all: we have to become demanding  consumers and citizens.
p196
aVThink it this way: next time someone  gives you a document
p197
aVthat you just simply don't understand, don't be shy,
p198
aVdon't keep quiet, pretending that you are  understanding everything.
p199
aVNo! Demand to understand. Ask.
p200
aVI know that this is not easy. Turn to the gentleman  in the little suite and say:
p201
aV"Look here, this contract, this part,  what does this mean?"
p202
aVIt's not easy, and perhaps it's even a bit  embarrassing, isn't it?
p203
aVBut it is not. It's a sign of intelligence.
p204
aVWhat do you teach your children when  they have doubts in school?
p205
aV"Don't say nothing to anyone, shut up really good  and act smart."
p206
aVNo, you don't, right? You say:
p207
aV"Look, when you don't understand, you put your hand  up in the air and ask the teacher until you are cleared."
p208
aVAnd that is exactly what we have to do,  as consumers and citizens.
p209
aVSo, next time you come across with  a document you don't understand,
p210
aVdemand to understand, put aside your pride and ask
p211
aVuntil you get completely cleared.
p212
aVThen, there's the other side, which is: "Okay, these awful documents
p213
aV"which are in circulation, they don't grow on trees.
p214
aV"Someone wrote them." Hum?
p215
aVMaybe, among this big group, some persons...
p216
aVI don't know, some lawyers, some public employees \u2014 I'm not asking you to identify yourselves,
p217
aVbut I ask you to search your own conscience.
p218
aVHow many times do you write documents  for the general public,
p219
aVfor people that don't share your language,
p220
aVand you write them in a language that  only you will understand?
p221
aVAnd you'll say: "Ah, that's because  there is a reason, here!"
p222
aVDear friends, I already heard all the reasons.
p223
aVThere are thousands of reasons. They go like these:
p224
aV"Ah, it's the house's culture"; "Oh, my boss!"
p225
aV"Oh, the judge! And what if this goes to court?"
p226
aV"What you want is to destroy language.  We have to educate people."
p227
aV"We can't lower the level"; bla, bla, bla...
p228
aVI've seen all of this. These are excuses.
p229
aVA while ago, they told us about Einstein.
p230
aVEinstein said this: "If you can't write about a subject,
p231
aVin a simple way, it's because, in fact,  you don't understand it."
p232
aVSo, if you... (Applause)
p233
aVTo Einstein... (Applause)
p234
aVTo Einstein...(Applause)
p235
aVSo \u2014 ah, ah, I don't have time! \u2014
p236
aVso, if you do know what you want to say \u2014  don't you? \u2014
p237
aVyou are aware of what you want to say,
p238
aVyou just have to do one thing: believe that it is  possible to write in a simple way.
p239
aVAnd how do you do that?
p240
aVIt's very easy. You write to your grandmother.  Hum?
p241
aVYou write to your grandmother. I'm going  to show grandma to you.
p242
aV(Laughter)
p243
aVYou write with respect and without paternalism.
p244
aVAnd you use three techniques that I'm going  to teach you. First of all:
p245
aVStart by the most important.
p246
aVGrandma has a lot to do. She is not going to read three pages to get to the main idea.
p247
aVStart by the most important.
p248
aVNext, use short sentences, because grandma,
p249
aVlike anyone of us,
p250
aVif you make very long sentences,
p251
aVshe gets to the end and she can't remember what  you said in the beginning, anymore.
p252
aVAnd lastly, the third, use plain words, those ones  that grandma knows.
p253
aVAlright? It's easy!
p254
aVBefore I leave,
p255
aVI would like to talk to you about "Clara" (Clear).  "Clara" is a project of social responsibility.
p256
aVIt has this mission: to change the way how public communication is made.
p257
aVWhat do we do?
p258
aVWe are going to launch this year  a collection of "Claro" guides,
p259
aVthat is, we are going to pick very, very,  very complex subjects and put them simple.
p260
aVWe are going to start with the  "Claro" Guide of Justice.
p261
aVI think it is an area... that comes in handy.  (Applause)
p262
aVAnd now I'm going to follow Manuel [Forjaz]'s advise.  If it's time to ask,
p263
aVwhoever wants to sponsor the  "Claro" Guide of Justice \u2014 I don't know...
p264
aVfor example, the EDP Foundation, or...ha? \u2014
p265
aVcome talk to me later.
p266
aVAnother thing we will do is to grant prizes  to the worse and best documents,
p267
aVbecause, indeed, there are people who are working to communicate in a clearer way,
p268
aVand that have to be rewarded,
p269
aVand there are lazy people that do nothing  about it and need to be humiliated.
p270
aVSo, we'll give prizes to the worst and to the best.
p271
aVI'm counting on your help. (Applause)
p272
aV(Applause)
p273
aVWe are going to launch... we are going to launch the campaign via Clara's Facebook,
p274
aVso, send your friendship request and  you'll be up to date.
p275
aVBut, lastly, above all, what does "Clara" want?
p276
aVIt wants to put two little things in your heads.
p277
aVThe first one: demand to understand. Don't be shy.
p278
aVAnd write in order to be understood.  Write to your grandma.
p279
aVAnd if you don't have a grandmother, write to  Mr. Domingos, he will like it.
p280
aVThank you. (Applause)
