VWhat does it mean to spend our time well?
p4
aVI spend a lot of my time
p5
aVthinking about how to spend my time.
p6
aVProbably too much \u2014 I probably obsess over it.
p7
aVMy friends think I do.
p8
aVBut I feel like I kind of have to, because these days,
p9
aVit feels like little bits of my time kind of slip away from me,
p10
aVand when that happens, it feels like parts of my life are slipping away.
p11
aa(lp12
VSpecifically,
p13
aVit feels like little bits of my time get slipped away
p14
aVto various things like this,
p15
aVlike technology \u2014 I check things.
p16
aVI'll give you an example.
p17
aVIf this email shows up \u2014
p18
aVhow many of you have gotten an email like this, right?
p19
aVI've been tagged in a photo.
p20
aVWhen this appears,
p21
aVI can't help but click on it right now.
p22
aVRight? Because, like, what if it's a bad photo?
p23
aVSo I have to click it right now.
p24
aVBut I'm not just going to click "See photo,"
p25
aVwhat I'm actually going to do is spend the next 20 minutes.
p26
aa(lp27
V(Laughter)
p28
aa(lp29
VBut the worst part is that I know this is what's going to happen,
p30
aVand even knowing that's what's going to happen
p31
aVdoesn't stop me from doing it again the next time.
p32
aVOr I find myself in a situation like this,
p33
aVwhere I check my email and I pull down to refresh,
p34
aVBut the thing is that 60 seconds later,
p35
aVI'll pull down to refresh again.
p36
aVWhy am I doing this?
p37
aVThis doesn't make any sense.
p38
aa(lp39
VBut I'll give you a hint why this is happening.
p40
aVWhat do you think makes more money in the United States
p41
aVthan movies, game parks and baseball combined?
p42
aVSlot machines.
p43
aVHow can slot machines make all this money
p44
aVwhen we play with such small amounts of money?
p45
aVWe play with coins.
p46
aVHow is this possible?
p47
aVWell, the thing is ...
p48
aVmy phone is a slot machine.
p49
aVEvery time I check my phone,
p50
aVI'm playing the slot machine to see,
p51
aVwhat am I going to get?
p52
aVWhat am I going to get?
p53
aVEvery time I check my email,
p54
aVI'm playing the slot machine,
p55
aVsaying, "What am I going to get?"
p56
aVEvery time I scroll a news feed,
p57
aVI'm playing the slot machine to see,
p58
aVwhat am I going to get next?
p59
aVAnd the thing is that,
p60
aVagain, knowing exactly how this works \u2014 and I'm a designer,
p61
aVI know exactly how the psychology of this works,
p62
aVI know exactly what's going on \u2014
p63
aVbut it doesn't leave me with any choice,
p64
aVI still just get sucked into it.
p65
aa(lp66
VSo what are we going to do?
p67
aVBecause it leaves us with this all-or-nothing relationship
p68
aVwith technology, right?
p69
aVYou're either on,
p70
aVand you're connected and distracted all the time,
p71
aVor you're off,
p72
aVbut then you're wondering,
p73
aVam I missing something important?
p74
aVIn other words, you're either distracted
p75
aVor you have fear of missing out.
p76
aVRight?
p77
aa(lp78
VSo we need to restore choice.
p79
aVWe want to have a relationship with technology
p80
aVthat gives us back choice about how we spend time with it,
p81
aVand we're going to need help from designers,
p82
aVbecause knowing this stuff doesn't help.
p83
aVWe're going to need design help.
p84
aVSo what would that look like?
p85
aa(lp86
VSo let's take an example that we all face:
p87
aVchat \u2014 text messaging.
p88
aVSo let's say there's two people.
p89
aVNancy's on the left and she's working on a document,
p90
aVand John's on the right.
p91
aVAnd John suddenly remembers,
p92
aV"I need to ask Nancy for that document before I forget."
p93
aVSo when he sends her that message,
p94
aVit blows away her attention.
p95
aa(lp96
VThat's what we're doing all the time, bulldozing each other's attention,
p97
aVleft and right.
p98
aVAnd there's serious cost to this,
p99
aVbecause every time we interrupt each other,
p100
aVit takes us about 23 minutes, on average,
p101
aVto refocus our attention.
p102
aVWe actually cycle through two different projects
p103
aVbefore we come back to the original thing we were doing.
p104
aVThis is Gloria Mark's research combined with Microsoft research,
p105
aVthat showed this.
p106
aVAnd her research also shows that it actually trains bad habits.
p107
aVThe more interruptions we get externally,
p108
aVit's conditioning and training us to interrupt ourselves.
p109
aVWe actually self-interrupt every three-and-a-half minutes.
p110
aa(lp111
VThis is crazy.
p112
aVSo how do we fix this?
p113
aVBecause Nancy and John are in this all-or-nothing relationship.
p114
aVNancy might want to disconnect,
p115
aVbut then she'd be worried:
p116
aVWhat if I'm missing something important?
p117
aa(lp118
VDesign can fix this problem.
p119
aVLet's say you have Nancy again on the left,
p120
aVJohn on the right.
p121
aVAnd John remembers, "I need to send Nancy that document."
p122
aVExcept this time,
p123
aVNancy can mark that she's focused.
p124
aVLet's say she drags a slider and says,
p125
aV"I want to be focused for 30 minutes,"
p126
aVso \u2014 bam \u2014 she's focused.
p127
aVNow when John wants to message her,
p128
aVhe can get the thought off of his mind \u2014
p129
aVbecause he has a need, he has this thought,
p130
aVand he needs to dump it out before he forgets.
p131
aVExcept this time,
p132
aVit holds the messages so that Nancy can still focus,
p133
aVbut John can get the thought off of his mind.
p134
aa(lp135
VBut this only works if one last thing is true,
p136
aVwhich is that Nancy needs to know that if something is truly important,
p137
aVJohn can still interrupt.
p138
aVBut instead of having constant accidental or mindless interruptions,
p139
aVwe're now only creating conscious interruptions,
p140
aa(lp141
VSo we're doing two things here.
p142
aVWe're creating a new choice for both Nancy and John,
p143
aVBut there's a second, subtle thing we're doing here, too.
p144
aVAnd it's that we're changing the question we're answering.
p145
aVInstead of the goal of chat being:
p146
aV"Let's design it so it's easy to send a message" \u2014
p147
aVthat's the goal of chat,
p148
aVit should be really easy to send a message to someone \u2014
p149
aVwe change the goal to something deeper and a human value,
p150
aVwhich is: "Let's create the highest possible quality communication
p151
aVin a relationship between two people.
p152
aVSo we upgraded the goal.
p153
aa(lp154
VNow, do designers actually care about this?
p155
aVDo we want to have conversations about what these deeper human goals are?
p156
aVWell, I'll tell you one story.
p157
aVA little over a year ago,
p158
aVI got to help organize a meeting
p159
aVbetween some of technology's leading designers and Thich Nhat Hanh.
p160
aVThich Nhat Hanh is an international spokesperson for mindfulness meditation.
p161
aVAnd it was the most amazing meeting.
p162
aVYou have to imagine \u2014 picture a room \u2014
p163
aVon one side of the room, you have a bunch of tech geeks;
p164
aVon the other side of the room,
p165
aVyou have a bunch of long brown robes, shaved heads, Buddhist monks.
p166
aVAnd the questions were about the deepest human values,
p167
aVlike what does the future of technology look like
p168
aVwhen you're designing for the deepest questions
p169
aVand the deepest human values?
p170
aVAnd our conversation centered on listening more deeply
p171
aVto what those values might be.
p172
aVHe joked in our conversation
p173
aVthat what if, instead of a spell check,
p174
aVyou had a compassion check,
p175
aVmeaning, you might highlight a word that might be accidentally abrasive \u2014
p176
aVperceived as abrasive by someone else.
p177
aa(lp178
VSo does this kind of conversation happen in the real world,
p179
aVnot just in these design meetings?
p180
aVWell, the answer is yes,
p181
aVand one of my favorites is Couchsurfing.
p182
aVIf you didn't know, Couchsurfing is a website
p183
aVthat matches people who are looking for a place to stay
p184
aVwith a free couch, from someone who's trying to offer it.
p185
aa(lp186
VSo, great service \u2014
p187
aVwhat would their design goal be?
p188
aVWhat are you designing for if you work at Couchsurfing?
p189
aVWell, you would think it's to match guests with hosts.
p190
aVRight?
p191
aVThat's a pretty good goal.
p192
aVBut that would kind of be like our goal with messaging before,
p193
aVwhere we're just trying to deliver a message.
p194
aa(lp195
VSo what's the deeper, human goal?
p196
aVWell, they set their goal
p197
aVas the need to create lasting, positive experiences and relationships
p198
aVbetween people who've never met before.
p199
aVAnd the most amazing thing about this was in 2007,
p200
aVthey introduced a way to measure this,
p201
aVwhich is incredible.
p202
aVI'll tell you how it works.
p203
aVFor every design goal you have,
p204
aVyou have to have a corresponding measurement
p205
aVto know how you're doing \u2014
p206
aVa way of measuring success.
p207
aVSo what they do is,
p208
aVlet's say you take two people who meet up,
p209
aVand they take the number of days those two people spent together,
p210
aVand then they estimate how many hours were in those days \u2014
p211
aVhow many hours did those two people spend together?
p212
aVAnd then after they spend that time together,
p213
aVthey ask both of them:
p214
aVHow positive was your experience?
p215
aVDid you have a good experience with this person that you met?
p216
aVAnd they subtract from those positive hours
p217
aVthe amount of time people spent on the website,
p218
aVbecause that's a cost to people's lives.
p219
aVWhy should we value that as success?
p220
aVAnd what you were left with
p221
aVis something they refer to as "net orchestrated conviviality,"
p222
aVor, really, just a net "Good Times" created.
p223
aVThe net hours that would have never existed, had Couchsurfing not existed.
p224
aa(lp225
VCan you imagine how inspiring it would be to come to work every day
p226
aVand measure your success
p227
aVin the actual net new contribution of hours in people's lives
p228
aVthat are positive, that would have never existed
p229
aVif you didn't do what you were about to do at work today?
p230
aVCan you imagine a whole world that worked this way?
p231
aa(lp232
VCan you imagine a social network that \u2014
p233
aVlet's say you care about cooking,
p234
aVand it measured its success in terms of cooking nights organized
p235
aVand the cooking articles that you were glad you read,
p236
aVand subtracted from that the articles you weren't glad you read
p237
aVor the time you spent scrolling that you didn't like?
p238
aVImagine a professional social network
p239
aVthat, instead of measuring its success in terms of connections created
p240
aVor messages sent,
p241
aVinstead measured its success in terms of the job offers that people got
p242
aVthat they were excited to get.
p243
aVAnd subtracted the amount of time people spent on the website.
p244
aVOr imagine dating services,
p245
aVlike maybe Tinder or something,
p246
aVwhere instead of measuring the number of swipes left and right people did,
p247
aVwhich is how they measure success today,
p248
aVinstead measured the deep, romantic, fulfilling connections people created.
p249
aVWhatever that was for them, by the way.
p250
aa(lp251
VBut can you imagine a whole world that worked this way,
p252
aVthat was helping you spend your time well?
p253
aVNow to do this you also need a new system,
p254
aVbecause you're probably thinking,
p255
aVtoday's Internet economy \u2014
p256
aVtoday's economy in general \u2014
p257
aVis measured in time spent.
p258
aVThe more users you have,
p259
aVthe more usage you have,
p260
aVthe more time people spend,
p261
aVthat's how we measure success.
p262
aa(lp263
VBut we've solved this problem before.
p264
aVWe solved it with organic,
p265
aVwhen we said we need to value things a different way.
p266
aVWe said this is a different kind of food.
p267
aVSo we can't compare it just based on price;
p268
aVthis is a different category of food.
p269
aVWe solved it with Leed Certification,
p270
aVwhere we said this is a different kind of building
p271
aVthat stood for different values of environmental sustainability.
p272
aa(lp273
VWhat if we had something like that for technology?
p274
aVWhat if we had something whose entire purpose and goal
p275
aVwas to help create net new positive contributions to human life?
p276
aVAnd what if we could value it a different way,
p277
aVso it would actually work?
p278
aVImagine you gave this different premium shelf space on app stores.
p279
aVImagine you had web browsers that helped route you
p280
aVto these kinds of design products.
p281
aVCan you imagine how exciting it would be to live and create that world?
p282
aa(lp283
VWe can create this world today.
p284
aVCompany leaders, all you have to do \u2014
p285
aVonly you can prioritize a new metric,
p286
aVwhich is your metric for net positive contribution to human life.
p287
aVAnd have an honest conversation about that.
p288
aVMaybe you're not doing so well to start with,
p289
aVbut let's start that conversation.
p290
aa(lp291
VDesigners, you can redefine success; you can redefine design.
p292
aVArguably, you have more power than many people in your organization
p293
aVto create the choices that all of us live by.
p294
aVMaybe like in medicine,
p295
aVwhere we have a Hippocratic oath
p296
aVto recognize the responsibility and this higher value
p297
aVthat we have to treat patients.
p298
aVWhat if designers had something like that,
p299
aVin terms of this new kind of design?
p300
aa(lp301
VAnd users, for all of us \u2014
p302
aVwe can demand technology that works this way.
p303
aVNow it may seem hard,
p304
aVbut McDonald's didn't have salads until the consumer demand was there.
p305
aVWalmart didn't have organic food until the consumer demand was there.
p306
aVWe have to demand this new kind of technology.
p307
aVAnd we can do that.
p308
aVAnd doing that
p309
aVwould amount to shifting from a world that's driven and run
p310
aVentirely on time spent,
p311
aVto world that's driven by time well spent.
p312
aa(lp313
VI want to live in this world,
p314
aVand I want this conversation to happen.
p315
aVLet's start that conversation now.
p316
aa(lp317
VThank you.
