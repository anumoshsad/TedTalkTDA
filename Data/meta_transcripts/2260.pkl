VI'm here to tell you about the real search for alien life.
p4
aVNot little green humanoids arriving in shiny UFOs,
p5
aValthough that would be nice.
p6
aVBut it's the search for planets orbiting stars far away.
p7
aa(lp8
VEvery star in our sky is a sun.
p9
aVAnd if our sun has planets \u2014
p10
aVMercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, etc.,
p11
aVsurely those other stars should have planets also,
p12
aVand they do.
p13
aVAnd in the last two decades,
p14
aVastronomers have found thousands of exoplanets.
p15
aa(lp16
VOur night sky is literally teeming with exoplanets.
p17
aVWe know, statistically speaking,
p18
aVthat every star has at least one planet.
p19
aVAnd in the search for planets,
p20
aVand in the future, planets that might be like Earth,
p21
aVwe're able to help address
p22
aVsome of the most amazing and mysterious questions
p23
aVthat have faced humankind for centuries.
p24
aVWhy are we here?
p25
aVWhy does our universe exist?
p26
aVHow did Earth form and evolve?
p27
aVHow and why did life originate and populate our planet?
p28
aVThe second question that we often think about is:
p29
aVAre we alone?
p30
aVIs there life out there?
p31
aVWho is out there?
p32
aVYou know, this question has been around for thousands of years,
p33
aVsince at least the time of the Greek philosophers.
p34
aVBut I'm here to tell you just how close we're getting
p35
aVto finding out the answer to this question.
p36
aVIt's the first time in human history that this really is within reach for us.
p37
aa(lp38
VNow when I think about the possibilities for life out there,
p39
aVI think of the fact that our sun is but one of many stars.
p40
aVThis is a photograph of a real galaxy,
p41
aVwe think our Milky Way looks like this galaxy.
p42
aVIt's a collection of bound stars.
p43
aVBut our [sun] is one of hundreds of billions of stars
p44
aVand our galaxy is one of upwards of hundreds of billions of galaxies.
p45
aVKnowing that small planets are very common,
p46
aVyou can just do the math.
p47
aVAnd there are just so many stars and so many planets out there,
p48
aVthat surely, there must be life somewhere out there.
p49
aVWell, the biologists get furious with me for saying that,
p50
aVbecause we have absolutely no evidence for life beyond Earth yet.
p51
aa(lp52
VWell, if we were able to look at our galaxy from the outside
p53
aVand zoom in to where our sun is,
p54
aVwe see a real map of the stars.
p55
aVAnd the highlighted stars are those with known exoplanets.
p56
aVThis is really just the tip of the iceberg.
p57
aVHere, this animation is zooming in onto our solar system.
p58
aVAnd you'll see here the planets
p59
aVas well as some spacecraft that are also orbiting our sun.
p60
aVNow if we can imagine going to the West Coast of North America,
p61
aVand looking out at the night sky,
p62
aVhere's what we'd see on a spring night.
p63
aVAnd you can see the constellations overlaid
p64
aVand again, so many stars with planets.
p65
aVThere's a special patch of the sky where we have thousands of planets.
p66
aa(lp67
VThis is where the Kepler Space Telescope focused for many years.
p68
aVLet's zoom in and look at one of the favorite exoplanets.
p69
aVThis star is called Kepler-186f.
p70
aVIt's a system of about five planets.
p71
aVAnd by the way, most of these exoplanets, we don't know too much about.
p72
aVWe know their size, and their orbit and things like that.
p73
aVBut there's a very special planet here called Kepler-186f.
p74
aVThis planet is in a zone that is not too far from the star,
p75
aVso that the temperature may be just right for life.
p76
aVHere, the artist's conception is just zooming in
p77
aVand showing you what that planet might be like.
p78
aa(lp79
VSo, many people have this romantic notion of astronomers
p80
aVgoing to the telescope on a lonely mountaintop
p81
aVand looking at the spectacular night sky through a big telescope.
p82
aVBut actually, we just work on our computers like everyone else,
p83
aVand we get our data by email or downloading from a database.
p84
aVSo instead of coming here to tell you
p85
aVabout the somewhat tedious nature of the data and data analysis
p86
aVand the complex computer models we make,
p87
aVI have a different way to try to explain to you
p88
aVsome of the things that we're thinking about exoplanets.
p89
aa(lp90
VHere's a travel poster:
p91
aV"Kepler-186f:
p92
aVWhere the grass is always redder on the other side."
p93
aVThat's because Kepler-186f orbits a red star,
p94
aVand we're just speculating that perhaps the plants there,
p95
aVif there is vegetation that does photosynthesis,
p96
aVit has different pigments and looks red.
p97
aV"Enjoy the gravity on HD 40307g,
p98
aVa Super-Earth."
p99
aVThis planet is more massive than Earth
p100
aVand has a higher surface gravity.
p101
aV"Relax on Kepler-16b,
p102
aVwhere your shadow always has company."
p103
aV(Laughter)
p104
aVWe know of a dozen planets that orbit two stars,
p105
aVand there's likely many more out there.
p106
aVIf we could visit one of those planets,
p107
aVyou literally would see two sunsets
p108
aVand have two shadows.
p109
aVSo actually, science fiction got some things right.
p110
aVTatooine from Star Wars.
p111
aVAnd I have a couple of other favorite exoplanets
p112
aVto tell you about.
p113
aVThis one is Kepler-10b,
p114
aVit's a hot, hot planet.
p115
aVIt orbits over 50 times closer to its star
p116
aVthan our Earth does to our sun.
p117
aVAnd actually, it's so hot,
p118
aVwe can't visit any of these planets, but if we could,
p119
aVwe would melt long before we got there.
p120
aVWe think the surface is hot enough to melt rock
p121
aVand has liquid lava lakes.
p122
aa(lp123
VGliese 1214b.
p124
aVThis planet, we know the mass and the size
p125
aVand it has a fairly low density.
p126
aVIt's somewhat warm.
p127
aVWe actually don't know really anything about this planet,
p128
aVbut one possibility is that it's a water world,
p129
aVlike a scaled-up version of one of Jupiter's icy moons
p130
aVthat might be 50 percent water by mass.
p131
aVAnd in this case, it would have a thick steam atmosphere
p132
aVoverlaying an ocean,
p133
aVnot of liquid water,
p134
aVbut of an exotic form of water, a superfluid \u2014
p135
aVnot quite a gas, not quite a liquid.
p136
aVAnd under that wouldn't be rock,
p137
aVbut a form of high-pressure ice,
p138
aVlike ice IX.
p139
aa(lp140
VSo out of all these planets out there,
p141
aVand the variety is just simply astonishing,
p142
aVwe mostly want to find the planets that are Goldilocks planets, we call them.
p143
aVNot too big, not too small,
p144
aVnot too hot, not too cold \u2014
p145
aVbut just right for life.
p146
aVBut to do that, we'd have to be able to look
p147
aVat the planet's atmosphere,
p148
aVbecause the atmosphere acts like a blanket trapping heat \u2014
p149
aVthe greenhouse effect.
p150
aVWe have to be able to assess the greenhouse gases
p151
aVon other planets.
p152
aVWell, science fiction got some things wrong.
p153
aVThe Star Trek Enterprise
p154
aVhad to travel vast distances at incredible speeds
p155
aVto orbit other planets
p156
aVso that First Officer Spock could analyze the atmosphere
p157
aVto see if the planet was habitable
p158
aVor if there were lifeforms there.
p159
aa(lp160
VWell, we don't need to travel at warp speeds
p161
aVto see other planet atmospheres,
p162
aValthough I don't want to dissuade any budding engineers
p163
aVfrom figuring out how to do that.
p164
aVWe actually can and do study planet atmospheres
p165
aVfrom here, from Earth orbit.
p166
aVThis is a picture, a photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope
p167
aVtaken by the shuttle Atlantis as it was departing
p168
aVafter the last human space flight to Hubble.
p169
aVThey installed a new camera, actually,
p170
aVthat we use for exoplanet atmospheres.
p171
aVAnd so far, we've been able to study dozens of exoplanet atmospheres,
p172
aVabout six of them in great detail.
p173
aVBut those are not small planets like Earth.
p174
aVThey're big, hot planets that are easy to see.
p175
aVWe're not ready,
p176
aVwe don't have the right technology yet to study small exoplanets.
p177
aVBut nevertheless,
p178
aVI wanted to try to explain to you how we study exoplanet atmospheres.
p179
aa(lp180
VI want you to imagine, for a moment, a rainbow.
p181
aVAnd if we could look at this rainbow closely,
p182
aVwe would see that some dark lines are missing.
p183
aVAnd here's our sun,
p184
aVthe white light of our sun split up,
p185
aVnot by raindrops, but by a spectrograph.
p186
aVAnd you can see all these dark, vertical lines.
p187
aVSome are very narrow, some are wide,
p188
aVsome are shaded at the edges.
p189
aVAnd this is actually how astronomers have studied objects in the heavens,
p190
aVliterally, for over a century.
p191
aVSo here, each different atom and molecule
p192
aVhas a special set of lines,
p193
aVa fingerprint, if you will.
p194
aVAnd that's how we study exoplanet atmospheres.
p195
aVAnd I'll just never forget when I started working
p196
aVon exoplanet atmospheres 20 years ago,
p197
aVhow many people told me,
p198
aV"This will never happen.
p199
aVWe'll never be able to study them. Why are you bothering?"
p200
aVAnd that's why I'm pleased to tell you about all the atmospheres studied now,
p201
aVand this is really a field of its own.
p202
aVSo when it comes to other planets, other Earths,
p203
aVin the future when we can observe them,
p204
aVwhat kind of gases would we be looking for?
p205
aVWell, you know, our own Earth has oxygen in the atmosphere
p206
aVto 20 percent by volume.
p207
aVThat's a lot of oxygen.
p208
aVBut without plants and photosynthetic life,
p209
aVthere would be no oxygen,
p210
aVvirtually no oxygen in our atmosphere.
p211
aVSo oxygen is here because of life.
p212
aVAnd our goal then is to look for gases in other planet atmospheres,
p213
aVgases that don't belong,
p214
aVthat we might be able to attribute to life.
p215
aVBut which molecules should we search for?
p216
aVI actually told you how diverse exoplanets are.
p217
aVWe expect that to continue in the future
p218
aVwhen we find other Earths.
p219
aa(lp220
VAnd that's one of the main things I'm working on now,
p221
aVI have a theory about this.
p222
aVIt reminds me that nearly every day,
p223
aVI receive an email or emails
p224
aVfrom someone with a crazy theory about physics of gravity
p225
aVor cosmology or some such.
p226
aVSo, please don't email me one of your crazy theories.
p227
aV(Laughter)
p228
aVWell, I had my own crazy theory.
p229
aVBut, who does the MIT professor go to?
p230
aVWell, I emailed a Nobel Laureate in Physiology or Medicine
p231
aVand he said, "Sure, come and talk to me."
p232
aVSo I brought my two biochemistry friends
p233
aVand we went to talk to him about our crazy theory.
p234
aVAnd that theory was that life produces all small molecules,
p235
aVso many molecules.
p236
aVLike, everything I could think of, but not being a chemist.
p237
aVThink about it:
p238
aVcarbon dioxide, carbon monoxide,
p239
aVmolecular hydrogen, molecular nitrogen,
p240
aVmethane, methyl chloride \u2014
p241
aVso many gases.
p242
aVThey also exist for other reasons,
p243
aVbut just life even produces ozone.
p244
aVSo we go to talk to him about this,
p245
aVand immediately, he shot down the theory.
p246
aVHe found an example that didn't exist.
p247
aVSo, we went back to the drawing board
p248
aVand we think we have found something very interesting in another field.
p249
aa(lp250
VBut back to exoplanets,
p251
aVthe point is that life produces so many different types of gases,
p252
aVliterally thousands of gases.
p253
aVAnd so what we're doing now is just trying to figure out
p254
aVon which types of exoplanets,
p255
aVwhich gases could be attributed to life.
p256
aVAnd so when it comes time when we find gases
p257
aVin exoplanet atmospheres
p258
aVthat we won't know if they're being produced
p259
aVby intelligent aliens or by trees,
p260
aVor a swamp,
p261
aVor even just by simple, single-celled microbial life.
p262
aa(lp263
VSo working on the models
p264
aVand thinking about biochemistry,
p265
aVit's all well and good.
p266
aVBut a really big challenge ahead of us is: how?
p267
aVHow are we going to find these planets?
p268
aVThere are actually many ways to find planets,
p269
aVseveral different ways.
p270
aVBut the one that I'm most focused on is how can we open a gateway
p271
aVso that in the future,
p272
aVwe can find hundreds of Earths.
p273
aVWe have a real shot at finding signs of life.
p274
aVAnd actually, I just finished leading a two-year project
p275
aVin this very special phase
p276
aVof a concept we call the starshade.
p277
aVAnd the starshade is a very specially shaped screen
p278
aVand the goal is to fly that starshade
p279
aVso it blocks out the light of a star
p280
aVso that the telescope can see the planets directly.
p281
aVHere, you can see myself and two team members
p282
aVholding up one small part of the starshade.
p283
aVIt's shaped like a giant flower,
p284
aVand this is one of the prototype petals.
p285
aVThe concept is that a starshade and telescope could launch together,
p286
aVwith the petals unfurling from the stowed position.
p287
aVThe central truss would expand,
p288
aVwith the petals snapping into place.
p289
aVNow, this has to be made very precisely,
p290
aVliterally, the petals to microns
p291
aVand they have to deploy to millimeters.
p292
aVAnd this whole structure would have to fly
p293
aVtens of thousands of kilometers away from the telescope.
p294
aVIt's about tens of meters in diameter.
p295
aVAnd the goal is to block out the starlight to incredible precision
p296
aVso that we'd be able to see the planets directly.
p297
aVAnd it has to be a very special shape,
p298
aVbecause of the physics of defraction.
p299
aVNow this is a real project that we worked on,
p300
aVliterally, you would not believe how hard.
p301
aVJust so you believe it's not just in movie format,
p302
aVhere's a real photograph
p303
aVof a second-generation starshade deployment test bed in the lab.
p304
aVAnd in this case, I just wanted you to know
p305
aVthat that central truss has heritage left over
p306
aVfrom large radio deployables in space.
p307
aa(lp308
VSo after all of that hard work
p309
aVwhere we try to think of all the crazy gases that might be out there,
p310
aVand we build the very complicated space telescopes
p311
aVthat might be out there,
p312
aVwhat are we going to find?
p313
aVWell, in the best case,
p314
aVwe will find an image of another exo-Earth.
p315
aVHere is Earth as a pale blue dot.
p316
aVAnd this is actually a real photograph of Earth
p317
aVtaken by the Voyager 1 spacecraft,
p318
aVfour billion miles away.
p319
aVAnd that red light is just scattered light in the camera optics.
p320
aa(lp321
VBut what's so awesome to consider
p322
aVis that if there are intelligent aliens
p323
aVorbiting on a planet around a star near to us
p324
aVand they build complicated space telescopes
p325
aVof the kind that we're trying to build,
p326
aVall they'll see is this pale blue dot,
p327
aVa pinprick of light.
p328
aVAnd so sometimes, when I pause to think
p329
aVabout my professional struggle and huge ambition,
p330
aVit's hard to think about that
p331
aVin contrast to the vastness of the universe.
p332
aVBut nonetheless, I am devoting the rest of my life
p333
aVto finding another Earth.
p334
aa(lp335
VAnd I can guarantee
p336
aa(lp337
Vthat in the next generation of space telescopes,
p338
aVin the second generation,
p339
aVwe will have the capability to find and identity other Earths.
p340
aVAnd the capability to split up the starlight
p341
aVso that we can look for gases
p342
aVand assess the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,
p343
aVestimate the surface temperature,
p344
aVand look for signs of life.
p345
aa(lp346
VBut there's more.
p347
aVIn this case of searching for other planets like Earth,
p348
aVwe are making a new kind of map
p349
aVof the nearby stars and of the planets orbiting them,
p350
aVincluding [planets] that actually might be inhabitable by humans.
p351
aa(lp352
VAnd so I envision that our descendants,
p353
aVhundreds of years from now,
p354
aVwill embark on an interstellar journey to other worlds.
p355
aVAnd they will look back at all of us
p356
aVas the generation who first found the Earth-like worlds.
p357
aa(lp358
VThank you.
p359
aa(lp360
V(Applause)
p361
aa(lp362
VJune Cohen: And I give you, for a question,
p363
aVRosetta Mission Manager Fred Jansen.
p364
aa(lp365
VFred Jansen: You mentioned halfway through
p366
aVthat the technology to actually look at the spectrum
p367
aVof an exoplanet like Earth is not there yet.
p368
aVWhen do you expect this will be there,
p369
aVand what's needed?
p370
aa(lp371
VActually, what we expect is what we call our next-generation Hubble telescope.
p372
aVAnd this is called the James Webb Space Telescope,
p373
aVand that will launch in 2018,
p374
aVand that's what we're going to do,
p375
aVwe're going to look at a special kind of planet
p376
aVcalled transient exoplanets,
p377
aVand that will be our first shot at studying small planets
p378
aVfor gases that might indicate the planet is habitable.
p379
aa(lp380
VJC: I'm going to ask you one follow-up question, too, Sara,
p381
aVas the generalist.
p382
aVSo I am really struck by the notion in your career
p383
aVof the opposition you faced,
p384
aVthat when you began thinking about exoplanets,
p385
aVthere was extreme skepticism in the scientific community
p386
aVthat they existed,
p387
aVand you proved them wrong.
p388
aVWhat did it take to take that on?
p389
aa(lp390
VSS: Well, the thing is that as scientists,
p391
aVwe're supposed to be skeptical,
p392
aVbecause our job to make sure that what the other person is saying
p393
aVactually makes sense or not.
p394
aVBut being a scientist,
p395
aVI think you've seen it from this session,
p396
aVit's like being an explorer.
p397
aVYou have this immense curiosity,
p398
aVthis stubbornness,
p399
aVthis sort of resolute will that you will go forward
p400
aVno matter what other people say.
p401
aa(lp402
VJC: I love that. Thank you, Sara.
