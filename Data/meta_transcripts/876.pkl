VWe live in difficult and challenging
p4
aVeconomic times, of course.
p5
aVAnd one of the first victims
p6
aVof difficult economic times,
p7
aVI think, is public spending of any kind,
p8
aVbut certainly in the firing line at the moment
p9
aVis public spending for science,
p10
aVand particularly curiosity-led science
p11
aVand exploration.
p12
aVSo I want to try and convince you in about 15 minutes
p13
aVthat that's a ridiculous
p14
aVand ludicrous thing to do.
p15
aa(lp16
VBut I think to set the scene,
p17
aVI want to show \u2014 the next slide is not my attempt
p18
aVto show the worst TED slide in the history of TED,
p19
aVbut it is a bit of a mess.
p20
aV(Laughter)
p21
aVBut actually, it's not my fault; it's from the Guardian newspaper.
p22
aVAnd it's actually a beautiful demonstration
p23
aVof how much science costs.
p24
aVBecause, if I'm going to make the case
p25
aVfor continuing to spend on curiosity-driven science and exploration,
p26
aVI should tell you how much it costs.
p27
aVSo this is a game called "spot the science budgets."
p28
aVThis is the U.K. government spend.
p29
aVYou see there, it's about 620 billion a year.
p30
aa(lp31
VThe science budget is actually \u2014
p32
aVif you look to your left, there's a purple set of blobs
p33
aVand then yellow set of blobs.
p34
aVAnd it's one of the yellow set of blobs
p35
aVaround the big yellow blob.
p36
aVIt's about 3.3 billion pounds per year
p37
aVout of 620 billion.
p38
aVThat funds everything in the U.K.
p39
aVfrom medical research, space exploration,
p40
aVwhere I work, at CERN in Geneva, particle physics,
p41
aVengineering, even arts and humanities,
p42
aVfunded from the science budget,
p43
aVwhich is that 3.3 billion, that little, tiny yellow blob
p44
aVaround the orange blob at the top left of the screen.
p45
aVSo that's what we're arguing about.
p46
aVThat percentage, by the way, is about the same
p47
aVin the U.S. and Germany and France.
p48
aVR&D in total in the economy,
p49
aVpublicly funded, is about
p50
aV0.6 percent of GDP.
p51
aVSo that's what we're arguing about.
p52
aa(lp53
VThe first thing I want to say,
p54
aVand this is straight from "Wonders of the Solar System,"
p55
aVis that our exploration of the solar system and the universe
p56
aVhas shown us that it is indescribably beautiful.
p57
aVThis is a picture that actually was sent back
p58
aVby the Cassini space probe around Saturn,
p59
aVafter we'd finished filming "Wonders of the Solar System."
p60
aVSo it isn't in the series.
p61
aVIt's of the moon Enceladus.
p62
aVSo that big sweeping, white
p63
aVsphere in the corner is Saturn,
p64
aVwhich is actually in the background of the picture.
p65
aVAnd that crescent there is the moon Enceladus,
p66
aVwhich is about as big as the British Isles.
p67
aVIt's about 500 kilometers in diameter.
p68
aVSo, tiny moon.
p69
aVWhat's fascinating and beautiful ...
p70
aVthis an unprocessed picture, by the way, I should say,
p71
aVit's black and white, straight from Saturnian orbit.
p72
aa(lp73
VWhat's beautiful is, you can probably see on the limb there
p74
aVsome faint, sort of,
p75
aVwisps of almost smoke
p76
aVrising up from the limb.
p77
aVThis is how we visualize that in "Wonders of the Solar System."
p78
aVIt's a beautiful graphic.
p79
aVWhat we found out were that those faint wisps
p80
aVare actually fountains of ice
p81
aVrising up from the surface of this tiny moon.
p82
aVThat's fascinating and beautiful in itself,
p83
aVbut we think that the mechanism
p84
aVfor powering those fountains
p85
aVrequires there to be lakes of liquid water
p86
aVbeneath the surface of this moon.
p87
aVAnd what's important about that
p88
aVis that, on our planet, on Earth,
p89
aVwherever we find liquid water,
p90
aVwe find life.
p91
aVSo, to find strong evidence
p92
aVof liquid, pools of liquid, beneath the surface of a moon
p93
aV750 million miles away from the Earth
p94
aVis really quite astounding.
p95
aVSo what we're saying, essentially,
p96
aVis maybe that's a habitat for life in the solar system.
p97
aVWell, let me just say, that was a graphic. I just want to show this picture.
p98
aVThat's one more picture of Enceladus.
p99
aVThis is when Cassini flew beneath Enceladus.
p100
aVSo it made a very low pass,
p101
aVjust a few hundred kilometers above the surface.
p102
aVAnd so this, again, a real picture of the ice fountains rising up into space,
p103
aVabsolutely beautiful.
p104
aa(lp105
VBut that's not the prime candidate for life in the solar system.
p106
aVThat's probably this place,
p107
aVwhich is a moon of Jupiter, Europa.
p108
aVAnd again, we had to fly to the Jovian system
p109
aVto get any sense that this moon, as most moons,
p110
aVwas anything other than a dead ball of rock.
p111
aVIt's actually an ice moon.
p112
aVSo what you're looking at is the surface of the moon Europa,
p113
aVwhich is a thick sheet of ice, probably a hundred kilometers thick.
p114
aVBut by measuring the way that
p115
aVEuropa interacts
p116
aVwith the magnetic field of Jupiter,
p117
aVand looking at how those cracks in the ice
p118
aVthat you can see there on that graphic move around,
p119
aVwe've inferred very strongly
p120
aVthat there's an ocean of liquid surrounding
p121
aVthe entire surface of Europa.
p122
aVSo below the ice, there's an ocean of liquid around the whole moon.
p123
aVIt could be hundreds of kilometers deep, we think.
p124
aVWe think it's saltwater, and that would mean that
p125
aVthere's more water on that moon of Jupiter
p126
aVthan there is in all the oceans of the Earth combined.
p127
aVSo that place, a little moon around Jupiter,
p128
aVis probably the prime candidate
p129
aVfor finding life on a moon
p130
aVor a body outside the Earth, that we know of.
p131
aVTremendous and beautiful discovery.
p132
aa(lp133
VOur exploration of the solar system
p134
aVhas taught us that the solar system is beautiful.
p135
aVIt may also have pointed the way to answering
p136
aVone of the most profound questions that you can possibly ask,
p137
aVwhich is: "Are we alone in the universe?"
p138
aVIs there any other use to exploration and science,
p139
aVother than just a sense of wonder?
p140
aVWell, there is.
p141
aVThis is a very famous picture
p142
aVtaken, actually, on my first Christmas Eve,
p143
aVDecember 24th, 1968,
p144
aVwhen I was about eight months old.
p145
aVIt was taken by Apollo 8
p146
aVas it went around the back of the moon.
p147
aVEarthrise from Apollo 8.
p148
aVA famous picture; many people have said that it's the picture
p149
aVthat saved 1968,
p150
aVwhich was a turbulent year \u2014
p151
aVthe student riots in Paris,
p152
aVthe height of the Vietnam War.
p153
aVThe reason many people think that about this picture,
p154
aVand Al Gore has said it many times, actually, on the stage at TED,
p155
aVis that this picture, arguably, was
p156
aVthe beginning of the environmental movement.
p157
aVBecause, for the first time,
p158
aVwe saw our world,
p159
aVnot as a solid, immovable,
p160
aVkind of indestructible place,
p161
aVbut as a very small, fragile-looking world
p162
aVjust hanging against the blackness of space.
p163
aa(lp164
VWhat's also not often said
p165
aVabout the space exploration, about the Apollo program,
p166
aVis the economic contribution it made.
p167
aVI mean while you can make arguments that it was wonderful
p168
aVand a tremendous achievement
p169
aVand delivered pictures like this,
p170
aVit cost a lot, didn't it?
p171
aVWell, actually, many studies have been done
p172
aVabout the economic effectiveness,
p173
aVthe economic impact of Apollo.
p174
aVThe biggest one was in 1975 by Chase Econometrics.
p175
aVAnd it showed that for every $1 spent on Apollo,
p176
aV14 came back into the U.S. economy.
p177
aVSo the Apollo program paid for itself
p178
aVin inspiration,
p179
aVin engineering, achievement
p180
aVand, I think, in inspiring young scientists and engineers
p181
aV14 times over.
p182
aVSo exploration can pay for itself.
p183
aa(lp184
VWhat about scientific discovery?
p185
aVWhat about driving innovation?
p186
aVWell, this looks like a picture of virtually nothing.
p187
aVWhat it is, is a picture of the spectrum
p188
aVof hydrogen.
p189
aVSee, back in the 1880s, 1890s,
p190
aVmany scientists, many observers,
p191
aVlooked at the light given off from atoms.
p192
aVAnd they saw strange pictures like this.
p193
aVWhat you're seeing when you put it through a prism
p194
aVis that you heat hydrogen up and it doesn't just glow
p195
aVlike a white light,
p196
aVit just emits light at particular colors,
p197
aVa red one, a light blue one, some dark blue ones.
p198
aVNow that led to an understanding of atomic structure
p199
aVbecause the way that's explained
p200
aVis atoms are a single nucleus
p201
aVwith electrons going around them.
p202
aVAnd the electrons can only be in particular places.
p203
aVAnd when they jump up to the next place they can be,
p204
aVand fall back down again,
p205
aVthey emit light at particular colors.
p206
aa(lp207
VAnd so the fact that atoms, when you heat them up,
p208
aVonly emit light at very specific colors,
p209
aVwas one of the key drivers
p210
aVthat led to the development of the quantum theory,
p211
aVthe theory of the structure of atoms.
p212
aVI just wanted to show this picture because this is remarkable.
p213
aVThis is actually a picture of the spectrum of the Sun.
p214
aVAnd now, this is a picture of atoms in the Sun's atmosphere
p215
aVabsorbing light.
p216
aVAnd again, they only absorb light at particular colors
p217
aVwhen electrons jump up and fall down,
p218
aVjump up and fall down.
p219
aVBut look at the number of black lines in that spectrum.
p220
aVAnd the element helium
p221
aVwas discovered just by staring at the light from the Sun
p222
aVbecause some of those black lines were found
p223
aVthat corresponded to no known element.
p224
aVAnd that's why helium's called helium.
p225
aVIt's called "helios" \u2014 helios from the Sun.
p226
aa(lp227
VNow, that sounds esoteric,
p228
aVand indeed it was an esoteric pursuit,
p229
aVbut the quantum theory quickly led
p230
aVto an understanding of the behaviors of electrons in materials
p231
aVlike silicon, for example.
p232
aVThe way that silicon behaves,
p233
aVthe fact that you can build transistors,
p234
aVis a purely quantum phenomenon.
p235
aVSo without that curiosity-driven
p236
aVunderstanding of the structure of atoms,
p237
aVwhich led to this rather esoteric theory, quantum mechanics,
p238
aVthen we wouldn't have transistors, we wouldn't have silicon chips,
p239
aVwe wouldn't have pretty much the basis
p240
aVof our modern economy.
p241
aa(lp242
VThere's one more, I think, wonderful twist to that tale.
p243
aVIn "Wonders of the Solar System,"
p244
aVwe kept emphasizing the laws of physics are universal.
p245
aVIt's one of the most incredible things about the physics
p246
aVand the understanding of nature that you get on Earth,
p247
aVis you can transport it, not only to the planets,
p248
aVbut to the most distant stars and galaxies.
p249
aVAnd one of the astonishing predictions
p250
aVof quantum mechanics,
p251
aVjust by looking at the structure of atoms \u2014
p252
aVthe same theory that describes transistors \u2014
p253
aVis that there can be no stars in the universe
p254
aVthat have reached the end of their life
p255
aVthat are bigger than, quite specifically, 1.4 times the mass of the Sun.
p256
aVThat's a limit imposed on the mass of stars.
p257
aVYou can work it out on a piece of paper in a laboratory,
p258
aVget a telescope, swing it to the sky,
p259
aVand you find that there are no dead stars
p260
aVbigger than 1.4 times the mass of the Sun.
p261
aVThat's quite an incredible prediction.
p262
aa(lp263
VWhat happens when you have a star that's right on the edge of that mass?
p264
aVWell, this is a picture of it.
p265
aVThis is the picture of a galaxy, a common "our garden" galaxy
p266
aVwith, what, 100 billion
p267
aVstars like our Sun in it.
p268
aVIt's just one of billions of galaxies in the universe.
p269
aVThere are a billion stars in the galactic core,
p270
aVwhich is why it's shining out so brightly.
p271
aVThis is about 50 million light years away,
p272
aVso one of our neighboring galaxies.
p273
aVBut that bright star there
p274
aVis actually one of the stars in the galaxy.
p275
aVSo that star is also
p276
aV50 million light years away.
p277
aVIt's part of that galaxy, and it's shining as brightly
p278
aVas the center of the galaxy
p279
aVwith a billion suns in it.
p280
aVThat's a Type Ia supernova explosion.
p281
aVNow that's an incredible phenomena,
p282
aVbecause it's a star that sits there.
p283
aVIt's called a carbon-oxygen dwarf.
p284
aVIt sits there about, say, 1.3 times the mass of the Sun.
p285
aVAnd it has a binary companion that goes around it,
p286
aVso a big star, a big ball of gas.
p287
aVAnd what it does is it sucks gas
p288
aVoff its companion star,
p289
aVuntil it gets to this limit called the Chandrasekhar limit,
p290
aVand then it explodes.
p291
aVAnd it explodes, and it shines as brightly
p292
aVas a billion suns for about two weeks,
p293
aVand releases, not only energy,
p294
aVbut a huge amount of chemical elements into the universe.
p295
aVIn fact, that one is a carbon-oxygen dwarf.
p296
aa(lp297
VNow, there was no carbon and oxygen
p298
aVin the universe at the Big Bang.
p299
aVAnd there was no carbon and oxygen in the universe
p300
aVthroughout the first generation of stars.
p301
aVIt was made in stars like that,
p302
aVlocked away and then returned to the universe
p303
aVin explosions like that
p304
aVin order to recondense into planets,
p305
aVstars, new solar systems
p306
aVand, indeed, people like us.
p307
aVI think that's a remarkable demonstration of the power
p308
aVand beauty and universality of the laws of physics,
p309
aVbecause we understand that process,
p310
aVbecause we understand
p311
aVthe structure of atoms here on Earth.
p312
aa(lp313
VThis is a beautiful quote that I found \u2014
p314
aVwe're talking about serendipity there \u2014 from Alexander Fleming:
p315
aV"When I woke up just after dawn
p316
aVon September 28, 1928,
p317
aVI certainly didn't plan to revolutionize all medicine
p318
aVby discovering the world's first antibiotic."
p319
aVNow, the explorers of the world of the atom
p320
aVdid not intend to invent the transistor.
p321
aVAnd they certainly didn't intend to
p322
aVdescribe the mechanics of supernova explosions,
p323
aVwhich eventually told us where
p324
aVthe building blocks of life
p325
aVwere synthesized in the universe.
p326
aVSo, I think science can be \u2014
p327
aVserendipity is important.
p328
aVIt can be beautiful. It can reveal quite astonishing things.
p329
aVIt can also, I think, finally
p330
aVreveal the most profound
p331
aVideas to us
p332
aVabout our place in the universe
p333
aVand really the value of our home planet.
p334
aa(lp335
VThis is a spectacular picture of our home planet.
p336
aVNow, it doesn't look like our home planet.
p337
aVIt looks like Saturn because, of course, it is.
p338
aVIt was taken by the Cassini space probe.
p339
aVBut it's a famous picture, not because of
p340
aVthe beauty and majesty of Saturn's rings,
p341
aVbut actually because of a tiny, faint blob
p342
aVjust hanging underneath one of the rings.
p343
aVAnd if I blow it up there, you see it.
p344
aVIt looks like a moon,
p345
aVbut in fact, it's a picture of Earth.
p346
aVIt was a picture of Earth captured in that frame of Saturn.
p347
aVThat's our planet from 750 million miles away.
p348
aVI think the Earth has got a strange property
p349
aVthat the farther away you get from it,
p350
aVthe more beautiful it seems.
p351
aa(lp352
VBut that is not the most distant or most famous picture of our planet.
p353
aVIt was taken by this thing, which is called the Voyager spacecraft.
p354
aVAnd that's a picture of me in front of it for scale.
p355
aVThe Voyager is a tiny machine.
p356
aVIt's currently 10 billion miles away from Earth,
p357
aVtransmitting with that dish, with the power of 20 watts,
p358
aVand we're still in contact with it.
p359
aVBut it visited Jupiter, Saturn,
p360
aVUranus and Neptune.
p361
aVAnd after it visited all four of those planets,
p362
aVCarl Sagan, who's one of my great heroes,
p363
aVhad the wonderful idea
p364
aVof turning Voyager around
p365
aVand taking a picture of every planet it had visited.
p366
aVAnd it took this picture of Earth.
p367
aVNow it's very hard to see the Earth there, it's called the "Pale Blue Dot" picture,
p368
aVbut Earth is suspended in that red shaft of light.
p369
aVThat's Earth from four billion miles away.
p370
aa(lp371
VAnd I'd like to read you what
p372
aVSagan wrote about it, just to finish,
p373
aVbecause I cannot say words as beautiful as this
p374
aVto describe what he saw
p375
aVin that picture that he had taken.
p376
aVHe said, "Consider again that dot.
p377
aVThat's here. That's home. That's us.
p378
aVOn it, everyone you love,
p379
aVeveryone you know, everyone you've ever heard of,
p380
aVevery human being who ever was

aVevery hunter and forager, every hero and coward,
p386
aVevery creator and destroyer of civilization,
p387
aVevery king and peasant, every young couple in love,
p388
aVevery mother and father, hopeful child,
p389
aVinventor and explorer,
p390
aVevery teacher of morals, every corrupt politician,
p391
aVevery superstar, every supreme leader,
p392
aVevery saint and sinner in the history of our species,
p393
aVlived there, on a mote of dust,
p394
aVsuspended in a sunbeam.
p395
aVIt's been said that astronomy's a humbling
p396
aVand character-building experience.
p397
aVThere is perhaps no better demonstration
p398
aVof the folly of human conceits
p399
aVthan this distant image of our tiny world.
p400
aVTo me, it underscores our responsibility
p401
aVto deal more kindly with one another
p402
aVand to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot,
p403
aVthe only home we've ever known."
p404
aa(lp405
VBeautiful words about
p406
aVthe power of science and exploration.
p407
aVThe argument has always been made, and it will always be made,
p408
aVthat we know enough about the universe.
p409
aVYou could have made it in the 1920s; you wouldn't have had penicillin.
p410
aVYou could have made it in the 1890s; you wouldn't have the transistor.
p411
aVAnd it's made today in these difficult economic times.
p412
aVSurely, we know enough.
p413
aVWe don't need to discover anything else about our universe.
p414
aa(lp415
VLet me leave the last words to someone
p416
aVwho's rapidly becoming a hero of mine,
p417
aVHumphrey Davy, who did his science at the turn of the 19th century.
p418
aVHe was clearly under assault all the time.
p419
aV"We know enough at the turn of the 19th century.
p420
aVJust exploit it; just build things."
p421
aVHe said this, he said, "Nothing is more fatal
p422
aVto the progress of the human mind
p423
aVthan to presume that our views of science
p424
aVare ultimate,
p425
aVthat our triumphs are complete,
p426
aVthat there are no mysteries in nature,
p427
aVand that there are no new worlds to conquer."
