VWomen represent
p4
aV50 percent of middle management
p5
aVand professional positions,
p6
aVbut the percentages of women at the top of organizations
p7
aVrepresent not even a third of that number.
p8
aVSo some people hear that statistic and they ask,
p9
aVwhy do we have so few women leaders?
p10
aVBut I look at that statistic
p11
aVand, if you, like me, believe
p12
aVthat leadership manifests at every level,
p13
aVyou would see that there's a tremendous,
p14
aVawesome resource of leaders
p15
aVwho are leading in middle management,
p16
aVwhich raises a different question:
p17
aVWhy are there so many women
p18
aVmired in the middle
p19
aVand what has to happen
p20
aVto take them to the top?
p21
aa(lp22
VSo some of you might be some of those women
p23
aVwho are in middle management
p24
aVand seeking to move up in your organization.
p25
aVWell, Tonya is a great example of one of these women.
p26
aVI met her two years ago.
p27
aVShe was a vice president in a Fortune 50 company,
p28
aVand she said to me with a sense of deep frustration,
p29
aV"I've worked really hard to improve my confidence
p30
aVand my assertiveness and develop a great brand,
p31
aVI get terrific performance evals from my boss,
p32
aVmy 360s in the organization let me know
p33
aVthat my teams love working for me,
p34
aVI've taken every management course that I can here,
p35
aVI am working with a terrific mentor,
p36
aVand yet I've been passed over
p37
aVtwice for advancement opportunities,
p38
aVeven when my manager knows
p39
aVthat I'm committed to moving up
p40
aVand even interested in an international assignment.
p41
aVI don't understand why
p42
aVI'm being passed over."
p43
aa(lp44
VSo what Tonya doesn't realize
p45
aVis that there's a missing 33 percent
p46
aVof the career success equation for women,
p47
aVand it's understanding what this missing 33 percent is
p48
aVthat's required to close the gender gap at the top.
p49
aa(lp50
VIn order to move up in organizations,
p51
aVyou have to be known for your leadership skills,
p52
aVand this would apply to any of you,
p53
aVwomen or men.
p54
aVIt means that you have to be recognized
p55
aVfor using the greatness in you
p56
aVto achieve and sustain extraordinary outcomes
p57
aVby engaging the greatness in others.
p58
aVPut in other language,
p59
aVit means you have to use your skills
p60
aVand talents and abilities
p61
aVto help the organization achieve
p62
aVits strategic financial goals
p63
aVand do that by working effectively with others
p64
aVinside of the organization and outside.
p65
aVAnd although all three of these elements
p66
aVof leadership are important,
p67
aVwhen it comes to moving up in organizations,
p68
aVthey aren't equally important.
p69
aVSo pay attention to the green box
p70
aVas I move forward.
p71
aa(lp72
VIn seeking and identifying
p73
aVemployees with high potential,
p74
aVthe potential to go to the top of organizations,
p75
aVthe skills and competencies
p76
aVthat relate to that green box
p77
aVare rated twice as heavily
p78
aVas those in the other two elements of leadership.
p79
aVThese skills and competencies
p80
aVcan be summarized as business,
p81
aVstrategic, and financial acumen.
p82
aVIn other words, this skill set has to do
p83
aVwith understanding where the organization is going,
p84
aVwhat its strategy is,
p85
aVwhat financial targets it has in place,
p86
aVand understanding your role
p87
aVin moving the organization forward.
p88
aVThis is that missing 33 percent
p89
aVof the career success equation for women,
p90
aVnot because it's missing in our capabilities
p91
aVor abilities,
p92
aVbut because it's missing in the advice
p93
aVthat we're given.
p94
aa(lp95
VHere's what I mean by that.
p96
aVFive years ago, I was asked to moderate
p97
aVa panel of executives,
p98
aVand the topic for the evening was
p99
aV"What do you look for in  high-potential employees?"
p100
aVSo think about the three elements of leadership
p101
aVas I summarize for you what they told me.
p102
aa(lp103
VThey said, "We look for people
p104
aVwho are smart and hard working and committed
p105
aVand trustworthy and resilient."
p106
aVSo which element of leadership does that relate to?
p107
aVPersonal greatness.
p108
aa(lp109
VThey said, "We look for employees
p110
aVwho are great with our customers,
p111
aVwho empower their teams,
p112
aVwho negotiate effectively,
p113
aVwho are able to manage conflict well,
p114
aVand are overall great communicators."
p115
aVWhich element of leadership does that equate to?
p116
aVEngaging the greatness in others.
p117
aa(lp118
VAnd then they pretty much stopped.
p119
aVSo I asked,
p120
aV"Well, what about people
p121
aVwho understand your business,
p122
aVwhere it's going,
p123
aVand their role in taking it there?
p124
aVAnd what about people who are able
p125
aVto scan the external environment,
p126
aVidentify risks and opportunities,
p127
aVmake strategy or make strategic recommendations?
p128
aVAnd what about people who are able
p129
aVto look at the financials of your business,
p130
aVunderstand the story that the financials tell,
p131
aVand either take appropriate action
p132
aVor make appropriate recommendations?"
p133
aa(lp134
VAnd to a man, they said,
p135
aV"That's a given."
p136
aa(lp137
VSo I turned to the audience
p138
aVof 150 women and I asked,
p139
aV"How many of you have ever been told
p140
aVthat the door-opener for career advancement
p141
aVis your business, strategic and financial acumen,
p142
aVand that all the other important stuff
p143
aVis what differentiates you in the talent pool?"
p144
aVThree women raised their hand,
p145
aVand I've asked this question of women
p146
aVall around the globe in the five years since,
p147
aVand the percentage is never much different.
p148
aa(lp149
VSo this is obvious, right?
p150
aVBut how can it be?
p151
aVWell, there are primarily three reasons
p152
aVthat there's this missing 33 percent
p153
aVin the career success advice given to women?
p154
aVWhen organizations direct women
p155
aVtoward resources
p156
aVthat focus on the conventional advice
p157
aVthat we've been hearing for over 40 years,
p158
aVthere's a notable absence of advice that relates
p159
aVto business, strategic and financial acumen.
p160
aVMuch of the advice is emphasizing
p161
aVpersonal actions that we need to take,
p162
aVlike become more assertive, become more confident,
p163
aVdevelop your personal brand,
p164
aVthings that Tonya's been working on,
p165
aVand advice about working with other people,
p166
aVthings like learn to self-promote,
p167
aVget a mentor, enhance your network,
p168
aVand virtually nothing said
p169
aVabout the importance of business, strategic
p170
aVand financial acumen.
p171
aVThis doesn't mean that this advice is unimportant.
p172
aVWhat it means is that this is advice
p173
aVthat's absolutely essential for breaking through
p174
aVfrom career start to middle management,
p175
aVbut it's not the advice
p176
aVthat gets women to break through
p177
aVfrom the middle, where we're 50 percent,
p178
aVto senior and executive positions.
p179
aVAnd this is why conventional advice to women
p180
aVin 40 years hasn't closed the gender gap at the top
p181
aVand won't close it.
p182
aa(lp183
VNow, the second reason
p184
aVrelates to Tonya's comments
p185
aVabout having had excellent performance evals,
p186
aVgreat feedback from her teams,
p187
aVand having taken every management training program
p188
aVshe can lay her hands on.
p189
aVSo you would think that she's getting
p190
aVmessages from her organization
p191
aVthrough the talent development systems
p192
aVand performance management systems
p193
aVthat let her know how important it is
p194
aVto develop business, strategic and financial acumen,
p195
aVbut here again, that green square is quite small.
p196
aVOn average,
p197
aVtalent and performance management systems
p198
aVin the organizations that I've worked with
p199
aVfocus three to one
p200
aVon the other two elements of leadership
p201
aVcompared to the importance of business,
p202
aVstrategic and financial acumen,
p203
aVwhich is why typical talent and performance systems
p204
aVhaven't closed and won't close
p205
aVthe gender gap at the top.
p206
aa(lp207
VNow, Tonya also talked about working with a mentor,
p208
aVand this is really important to talk about,
p209
aVbecause if organizations,
p210
aVtalent and performance systems
p211
aVaren't giving people in general
p212
aVinformation about the importance of
p213
aVbusiness, strategic and financial acumen,
p214
aVhow are men getting to the top?
p215
aVWell, there are primarily two ways.
p216
aVOne is because of the positions
p217
aVthey're guided into,
p218
aVand the other is because of informal mentoring
p219
aVand sponsorship.
p220
aa(lp221
VSo what's women's experience
p222
aVas it relates to mentoring?
p223
aVWell, this comment from an executive
p224
aVthat I worked with recently
p225
aVillustrates that experience.
p226
aVHe was very proud of the fact that last year,
p227
aVhe had two protégés: a man and a woman.
p228
aVAnd he said, "I helped the woman build confidence,
p229
aVI helped the man learn the business,
p230
aVand I didn't realize that I was treating them
p231
aVany differently."
p232
aVAnd he was sincere about that.
p233
aa(lp234
VSo what this illustrates is that
p235
aVas managers, whether we're women or men,
p236
aVwe have mindsets about women and men,
p237
aVabout careers in leadership,
p238
aVand these unexamined mindsets
p239
aVwon't close the gender gap at the top.
p240
aVSo how do we take this idea
p241
aVof the missing 33 percent
p242
aVand turn it into action?
p243
aVWell, for women, the answer is obvious:
p244
aVwe have to begin to focus more
p245
aVon developing and demonstrating
p246
aVthe skills we have
p247
aVthat show that we're people who understand
p248
aVour businesses, where they're headed,
p249
aVand our role in taking it there.
p250
aVThat's what enables that breakthrough
p251
aVfrom middle management
p252
aVto leadership at the top.
p253
aVBut you don't have to be a middle manager to do this.
p254
aVOne young scientist that works in a biotech firm
p255
aVused her insight about the missing 33 percent
p256
aVto weave financial impact data
p257
aVinto a project update she did
p258
aVand got tremendous positive feedback
p259
aVfrom the managers in the room.
p260
aa(lp261
VSo we don't want to put 100 percent
p262
aVof the responsibility on women's shoulders,
p263
aVnor would it be wise to do so, and here's why:
p264
aVIn order for companies to achieve
p265
aVtheir strategic financial goals,
p266
aVexecutives understand that they have to have
p267
aVeveryone pulling in the same direction.
p268
aVIn other words, the term we use in business is,
p269
aVwe have to have strategic alignment.
p270
aVAnd executives know this very well,
p271
aVand yet only 37 percent,
p272
aVaccording to a recent Conference Board report,
p273
aVbelieve that they have that
p274
aVstrategic alignment in place.
p275
aVSo for 63 percent of organizations,
p276
aVachieving their strategic financial goals
p277
aVis questionable.
p278
aVAnd if you think about what I've just shared,
p279
aVthat you have situations where at least 50 percent
p280
aVof your middle managers
p281
aVhaven't received clear messaging
p282
aVthat they have to become focused on the business,
p283
aVwhere it's headed, and their role in taking it there,
p284
aVit's not surprising that that percentage
p285
aVof executives who are confident about alignment
p286
aVis so low,
p287
aVwhich is why there are other people
p288
aVwho have a role to play in this.
p289
aVIt's important for directors on boards
p290
aVto expect from their executives
p291
aVproportional pools of women when they sit down
p292
aVonce a year for their succession discussions.
p293
aVWhy? Because if they aren't seeing that,
p294
aVit could be a red flag
p295
aVthat their organization isn't as aligned
p296
aVas it could potentially be.
p297
aVIt's important for CEOs
p298
aVto also expect these proportional pools,
p299
aVand if they hear comments like,
p300
aV"Well, she doesn't have enough business experience,"
p301
aVask the question,
p302
aV"What are we going to do about that?"
p303
aVIt's important for H.R. executives
p304
aVto make sure that the missing 33 percent
p305
aVis appropriately emphasized,
p306
aVand it's important for women and men
p307
aVwho are in management positions
p308
aVto examine the mindsets we hold
p309
aVabout women and men, about careers and success,
p310
aVto make sure we are creating a level playing field
p311
aVfor everybody.
p312
aa(lp313
VSo let me close with the latest chapter
p314
aVin Tonya's story.
p315
aVTonya emailed me two months ago,
p316
aVand she said that she had been interviewed for a new position,
p317
aVand during the interview, they probed
p318
aVabout her business acumen
p319
aVand her strategic insights into the industry,
p320
aVand she said that she was so happy to report
p321
aVthat now she has a new position
p322
aVreporting directly to the  chief information officer
p323
aVat her company.
p324
aVSo for some of you, the missing 33 percent
p325
aVis an idea for you to put into action,
p326
aVand I hope that for all of you,
p327
aVyou will see it as an idea worth spreading
p328
aVin order to help organizations be more effective,
p329
aVto help women create careers that soar,
p330
aVand to help close the gender gap at the top.
p331
