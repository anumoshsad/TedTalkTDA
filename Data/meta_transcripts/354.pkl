VA year ago, I spoke to you about a book
p4
aVthat I was just in the process of completing,
p5
aVthat has come out in the interim, and I would like to talk to you today
p6
aVabout some of the controversies that that book inspired.
p7
aVThe book is called "The Blank Slate,"
p8
aVbased on the popular idea
p9
aVthat the human mind is a blank slate,
p10
aVand that all of its structure comes from
p11
aVsocialization, culture, parenting, experience.
p12
aVThe "blank slate" was an influential idea in the 20th century.
p13
aVHere are a few quotes indicating that:
p14
aV"Man has no nature," from the historian
p15
aVJose Ortega y Gasset;
p16
aV"Man has no instincts," from the
p17
aVanthropologist Ashley Montagu;
p18
aV"The human brain is capable of a full range of behaviors
p19
aVand predisposed to none," from the late scientist Stephen Jay Gould.
p20
aa(lp21
VThere are a number of reasons to doubt that the human mind
p22
aVis a blank slate,
p23
aVand some of them just come from common sense.
p24
aVAs many people have told me over the years,
p25
aVanyone who's had more than one child
p26
aVknows that kids come into the world
p27
aVwith certain temperaments and talents;
p28
aVit doesn't all come from the outside.
p29
aVOh, and anyone who
p30
aVhas both a child and a house pet
p31
aVhas surely noticed that the child, exposed to speech,
p32
aVwill acquire a human language,
p33
aVwhereas the house pet won't,
p34
aVpresumably because of some innate different between them.
p35
aVAnd anyone who's ever been
p36
aVin a heterosexual relationship knows that
p37
aVthe minds of men and the minds of women are not indistinguishable.
p38
aVThere are also, I think,
p39
aVincreasing results from
p40
aVthe scientific study of humans
p41
aVthat, indeed, we're not born blank slates.
p42
aVOne of them, from anthropology,
p43
aVis the study of human universals.
p44
aVIf you've ever taken anthropology, you know that it's a \u2014
p45
aVkind of an occupational
p46
aVpleasure of anthropologists to show
p47
aVhow exotic other cultures can be,
p48
aVand that there are places out there where, supposedly,
p49
aVeverything is the opposite to the way it is here.
p50
aVBut if you instead
p51
aVlook at what is common to the world's cultures,
p52
aVyou find that there is an enormously rich set
p53
aVof behaviors and emotions
p54
aVand ways of construing the world
p55
aVthat can be found in all of the world's 6,000-odd cultures.
p56
aVThe anthropologist Donald Brown has tried to list them all,
p57
aVand they range from aesthetics,
p58
aVaffection and age statuses
p59
aVall the way down to weaning, weapons, weather,
p60
aVattempts to control, the color white
p61
aVand a worldview.
p62
aa(lp63
VAlso, genetics and neuroscience
p64
aVare increasingly showing that the brain
p65
aVis intricately structured.
p66
aVThis is a recent study by the neurobiologist Paul Thompson
p67
aVand his colleagues in which they \u2014
p68
aVusing MRI \u2014
p69
aVmeasured the distribution of gray matter \u2014
p70
aVthat is, the outer layer of the cortex \u2014
p71
aVin a large sample of pairs of people.
p72
aVThey coded correlations in the thickness
p73
aVof gray matter in different parts of the brain
p74
aVusing a false color scheme, in which
p75
aVno difference is coded as purple,
p76
aVand any color other than purple indicates
p77
aVa statistically significant correlation.
p78
aVWell, this is what happens when you pair people up at random.
p79
aVBy definition, two people picked at random
p80
aVcan't have correlations in the distribution
p81
aVof gray matter in the cortex.
p82
aVThis is what happens in people who share
p83
aVhalf of their DNA \u2014 fraternal twins.
p84
aVAnd as you can see, large amounts of the brain
p85
aVare not purple, showing that if one person
p86
aVhas a thicker bit of cortex
p87
aVin that region, so does his fraternal twin.
p88
aVAnd here's what happens if you
p89
aVget a pair of people who share all their DNA \u2014
p90
aVnamely, clones or identical twins.
p91
aVAnd you can see huge areas of cortex where there are
p92
aVmassive correlations in the distribution of gray matter.
p93
aa(lp94
VNow, these aren't just
p95
aVdifferences in anatomy,
p96
aVlike the shape of your ear lobes,
p97
aVbut they have consequences in thought and behavior
p98
aVthat are well illustrated in this famous cartoon by Charles Addams:
p99
aV"Separated at birth, the Mallifert twins meet accidentally."
p100
aVAs you can see, there are two inventors
p101
aVwith identical contraptions in their lap, meeting
p102
aVin the waiting room of a patent attorney.
p103
aVNow, the cartoon is not such an exaggeration, because
p104
aVstudies of identical twins who were separated at birth
p105
aVand then tested in adulthood
p106
aVshow that they have astonishing similarities.
p107
aVAnd this happens in every pair of identical twins
p108
aVseparated at birth ever studied \u2014
p109
aVbut much less so with fraternal twins separated at birth.
p110
aVMy favorite example is a pair of twins,
p111
aVone of whom was brought up
p112
aVas a Catholic in a Nazi family in Germany,
p113
aVthe other brought up in a Jewish family in Trinidad.
p114
aVWhen they walked into the lab in Minnesota,
p115
aVthey were wearing identical navy blue shirts with epaulettes;
p116
aVboth of them liked to dip buttered toast in coffee,
p117
aVboth of them kept rubber bands around their wrists,
p118
aVboth of them flushed the toilet before using it as well as after,
p119
aVand both of them liked to surprise people
p120
aVby sneezing in crowded elevators to watch them jump.
p121
aVNow \u2014
p122
aVthe story might seem to good to be true,
p123
aVbut when you administer
p124
aVbatteries of psychological tests,
p125
aVyou get the same results \u2014 namely,
p126
aVidentical twins separated at birth show
p127
aVquite astonishing similarities.
p128
aa(lp129
VNow, given both the common sense
p130
aVand scientific data
p131
aVcalling the doctrine of the blank slate into question,
p132
aVwhy should it have been such an appealing notion?
p133
aVWell, there are a number of political reasons why people have found it congenial.
p134
aVThe foremost is that if we're blank slates,
p135
aVthen, by definition, we are equal,
p136
aVbecause zero equals zero equals zero.
p137
aVBut if something is written on the slate,
p138
aVthen some people could have more of it than others,
p139
aVand according to this line of thinking, that would justify
p140
aVdiscrimination and inequality.
p141
aa(lp142
VAnother political fear of human nature
p143
aVis that if we are blank slates,
p144
aVwe can perfect mankind \u2014
p145
aVthe age-old dream of the perfectibility of our species
p146
aVthrough social engineering.
p147
aVWhereas, if we're born with certain instincts,
p148
aVthen perhaps some of them might condemn us
p149
aVto selfishness, prejudice and violence.
p150
aVWell, in the book, I argue that these are, in fact, non sequiturs.
p151
aVAnd just to make a long story short:
p152
aVfirst of all, the concept of fairness
p153
aVis not the same as the concept of sameness.
p154
aVAnd so when Thomas Jefferson wrote
p155
aVin the Declaration of Independence,
p156
aV"We hold these truths to be self-evident,
p157
aVthat all men are created equal,"
p158
aVhe did not mean "We hold these truths to be self-evident,
p159
aVthat all men are clones."
p160
aVRather, that all men are equal in terms of their rights,
p161
aVand that every person ought to be treated
p162
aVas an individual, and not prejudged
p163
aVby the statistics of particular groups
p164
aVthat they may belong to.
p165
aVAlso, even if we were born
p166
aVwith certain ignoble motives,
p167
aVthey don't automatically lead to ignoble behavior.
p168
aVThat is because the human mind
p169
aVis a complex system with many parts,
p170
aVand some of them can inhibit others.
p171
aVFor example, there's excellent reason to believe
p172
aVthat virtually all humans are born with a moral sense,
p173
aVand that we have cognitive abilities that allow us
p174
aVto profit from the lessons of history.
p175
aVSo even if people did have impulses
p176
aVtowards selfishness or greed,
p177
aVthat's not the only thing in the skull,
p178
aVand there are other parts of the mind that can counteract them.
p179
aa(lp180
VIn the book, I
p181
aVgo over controversies such as this one,
p182
aVand a number of other hot buttons,
p183
aVhot zones, Chernobyls, third rails, and so on \u2014
p184
aVincluding the arts, cloning, crime,
p185
aVfree will, education, evolution,
p186
aVgender differences, God, homosexuality,
p187
aVinfanticide, inequality, Marxism, morality,
p188
aVNazism, parenting, politics,
p189
aVrace, rape, religion, resource depletion,
p190
aVsocial engineering, technological risk and war.
p191
aVAnd needless to say, there were certain risks
p192
aVin taking on these subjects.
p193
aVWhen I wrote a first draft of the book,
p194
aVI circulated it to a number of colleagues for comments,
p195
aVand here are some of
p196
aVthe reactions that I got:
p197
aV"Better get a security camera for your house."
p198
aV"Don't expect to get any more awards, job offers
p199
aVor positions in scholarly societies."
p200
aV"Tell your publisher not to list your hometown
p201
aVin your author bio."
p202
aV"Do you have tenure?"
p203
aV(Laughter)
p204
aa(lp205
VWell, the book came out in October,
p206
aVand nothing terrible has happened.
p207
aVI \u2014 I like \u2014
p208
aVThere was indeed reason to be nervous,
p209
aVand there were moments in which I did feel nervous,
p210
aVknowing the history
p211
aVof what has happened to people
p212
aVwho've taken controversial stands
p213
aVor discovered disquieting findings
p214
aVin the behavioral sciences.
p215
aVThere are many cases, some of which I talk about in the book,
p216
aVof people who have been slandered, called Nazis,
p217
aVphysically assaulted, threatened with criminal prosecution
p218
aVfor stumbling across or arguing
p219
aVabout controversial findings.
p220
aVAnd you never know when you're going to
p221
aVcome across one of these booby traps.
p222
aVMy favorite example is a pair of psychologists
p223
aVwho did research on left-handers,
p224
aVand published some data showing that left-handers are, on average,
p225
aVmore susceptible to disease, more prone to accidents
p226
aVand have a shorter lifespan.
p227
aVIt's not clear, by the way, since then,
p228
aVwhether that is an accurate generalization,
p229
aVbut the data at the time seemed to support that.
p230
aVWell, pretty soon they were barraged
p231
aVwith enraged letters,
p232
aVdeath threats,
p233
aVban on the topic in a number of scientific journals,
p234
aVcoming from irate left-handers
p235
aVand their advocates,
p236
aVand they were literally afraid to open their mail
p237
aVbecause of the venom and vituperation
p238
aVthat they had inadvertently inspired.
p239
aa(lp240
VWell,
p241
aVthe night is young, but the book has been out
p242
aVfor half a year,
p243
aVand nothing terrible has happened.
p244
aVNone of the dire professional consequences
p245
aVhas taken place \u2014
p246
aVI haven't been
p247
aVexiled from the city of Cambridge.
p248
aVBut what I wanted to talk about
p249
aVare two of these hot buttons
p250
aVthat have aroused the strongest response
p251
aVin the 80-odd reviews
p252
aVthat The Blank Slate has received.
p253
aVI'll just put that list up for a few seconds,
p254
aVand see if you can guess which two
p255
aV\u2014 I would estimate that probably two of these topics
p256
aVinspired probably 90 percent
p257
aVof the reaction in the various reviews
p258
aVand radio interviews.
p259
aVIt's not violence and war,
p260
aVit's not race, it's not gender,
p261
aVit's not Marxism, it's not Nazism.
p262
aVThey are: the arts and parenting.
p263
aV(Laughter)
p264
aVSo let me tell you what
p265
aVaroused such irate responses,
p266
aVand I'll let you decide if whether they \u2014
p267
aVthe claims are really that outrageous.
p268
aa(lp269
VLet me start with the arts.
p270
aVI note that among the long list of human universals
p271
aVthat I presented a few slides ago
p272
aVare art.
p273
aVThere is no society ever discovered
p274
aVin the remotest corner of the world that has not had something
p275
aVthat we would consider the arts.
p276
aVVisual arts \u2014 decoration of surfaces and bodies \u2014
p277
aVappears to be a human universal.
p278
aVThe telling of stories, music,
p279
aVdance, poetry \u2014 found in all cultures,
p280
aVand many of the motifs and themes
p281
aVthat
p282
aVgive us pleasure in the arts
p283
aVcan be found in all human societies:
p284
aVa preference for symmetrical forms,
p285
aVthe use of repetition and variation,
p286
aVeven things as specific as the fact
p287
aVthat in poetry all over the world,
p288
aVyou have lines that are very close
p289
aVto three seconds long, separated by pauses.
p290
aVNow, on the other hand,
p291
aVin the second half of the 20th century,
p292
aVthe arts are frequently said to be in decline.
p293
aVAnd I have a collection,
p294
aVprobably 10 or 15 headlines, from highbrow magazines
p295
aVdeploring the fact that
p296
aVthe arts are in decline in our time.
p297
aVI'll give you a couple of representative quotes:
p298
aV"We can assert with some confidence that our own period is
p299
aVone of decline, that the standards of culture are lower
p300
aVthan they were 50 years ago, and that the evidences of this decline
p301
aVare visible in every department of human activity."
p302
aVThat's a quote from T. S. Eliot, a little more than 50 years ago.
p303
aVAnd a more recent one:
p304
aV"The possibility of sustaining high culture in our time
p305
aVis becoming increasing problematical.
p306
aVSerious book stores are losing their franchise,
p307
aVnonprofit theaters are surviving primarily
p308
aVby commercializing their repertory,
p309
aVsymphony orchestras are diluting their programs,
p310
aVpublic television is increasing its dependence
p311
aVon reruns of British sitcoms,
p312
aVclassical radio stations are dwindling,
p313
aVmuseums are resorting to blockbuster shows, dance is dying."
p314
aVThat's from Robert Brustein,
p315
aVthe famous drama critic and director,
p316
aVin The New Republic about five years ago.
p317
aa(lp318
VWell, in fact, the arts are not in decline.
p319
aVI don't think this will as a surprise to anyone in this room,
p320
aVbut by any standard
p321
aVthey have never been flourishing
p322
aVto a greater extent.
p323
aVThere are, of course, entirely new art forms
p324
aVand new media, many of which you've heard
p325
aVover these few days.
p326
aVBy any economic standard,
p327
aVthe demand for art of all forms
p328
aVis skyrocketing,
p329
aVas you can tell from the price of opera tickets,
p330
aVby the number of books sold,
p331
aVby the number of books published,
p332
aVthe number of musical titles released,
p333
aVthe number of new albums and so on.
p334
aVThe only grain of truth to this
p335
aVcomplaint that the arts are in decline
p336
aVcome from three spheres.
p337
aVOne of them is in elite art since the 1930s \u2014
p338
aVsay, the kinds of works performed
p339
aVby major symphony orchestras,
p340
aVwhere most of the repertory is before 1930,
p341
aVor the works shown in
p342
aVmajor galleries and prestigious museums.
p343
aVIn literary criticism and analysis,
p344
aVprobably 40 or 50 years ago,
p345
aVliterary critics were a kind of cultural hero;
p346
aVnow they're kind of a national joke.
p347
aVAnd the humanities and arts programs
p348
aVin the universities, which by many measures,
p349
aVindeed are in decline.
p350
aVStudents are staying away in droves,
p351
aVuniversities are disinvesting
p352
aVin the arts and humanities.
p353
aa(lp354
VWell, here's a diagnosis.
p355
aVThey didn't ask me, but by their own admission,
p356
aVthey need all the help that they can get.
p357
aVAnd I would like to suggest that it's not a coincidence
p358
aVthat this supposed decline
p359
aVin the elite arts and criticism
p360
aVoccurred in the same point in history in which
p361
aVthere was a widespread denial of human nature.
p362
aVA famous quotation can be found \u2014
p363
aVif you look on the web, you can find it in
p364
aVliterally scores
p365
aVof English core syllabuses \u2014
p366
aV"In or about December 1910,
p367
aVhuman nature changed."
p368
aVA paraphrase of a quote by Virginia Woolf,
p369
aVand there's some debate
p370
aVas to what she actually meant by that.
p371
aVBut it's very clear, looking at these syllabuses,
p372
aVthat \u2014 it's used now
p373
aVas a way of saying that all forms
p374
aVof appreciation of art
p375
aVthat were in place for centuries, or millennia,
p376
aVin the 20th century were discarded.
p377
aVThe beauty and pleasure in art \u2014
p378
aVprobably a human universal \u2014
p379
aVwere \u2014 began to be considered saccharine,
p380
aVor kitsch, or commercial.
p381
aVBarnett Newman had a famous quote that "the impulse of modern art
p382
aVis the desire to destroy beauty" \u2014
p383
aVwhich was considered bourgeois or tacky.
p384
aVAnd here's just one example.
p385
aVI mean, this is perhaps a representative example
p386
aVof the visual depiction of the female form
p387
aVin the 15th century;
p388
aVhere is a representative example
p389
aVof the depiction of the female form in the 20th century.
p390
aVAnd, as you can see, there \u2014 something has changed
p391
aVin the way the elite arts
p392
aVappeal to the senses.
p393
aa(lp394
VIndeed, in movements of modernism
p395
aVand post-modernism,
p396
aVthere was visual art without beauty,
p397
aVliterature without narrative and plot,
p398
aVpoetry without meter and rhyme,
p399
aVarchitecture and planning without ornament,
p400
aVhuman scale, green space and natural light,
p401
aVmusic without melody and rhythm,
p402
aVand criticism without clarity,
p403
aVattention to aesthetics and insight into the human condition.
p404
aV(Laughter)
p405
aVLet me give just you an example to back up that last statement.
p406
aVBut here, there \u2014 one of the most famous literary
p407
aVEnglish scholars of our time
p408
aVis the Berkeley professor,
p409
aVJudith Butler.
p410
aVAnd here is an example of
p411
aVone of her analyses:
p412
aV"The move from a structuralist account in which capital
p413
aVis understood to structure social relations
p414
aVin relatively homologous ways
p415
aVto a view of hegemony in which power relations are subject to repetition,
p416
aVconvergence and rearticulation
p417
aVbrought the question of temporality into the thinking of structure,
p418
aVand marked a shift from the form of Althusserian theory
p419
aVthat takes structural totalities as theoretical objects ..."
p420
aVWell, you get the idea.
p421
aVBy the way, this is one sentence \u2014
p422
aVyou can actually parse it.
p423
aVWell, the argument in "The Blank Slate"
p424
aVwas that elite art and criticism
p425
aVin the 20th century,
p426
aValthough not the arts in general,
p427
aVhave disdained beauty, pleasure,
p428
aVclarity, insight and style.
p429
aVPeople are staying away from elite art and criticism.
p430
aVWhat a puzzle \u2014 I wonder why.
p431
aVWell, this turned out to be probably
p432
aVthe most controversial claim in the book.
p433
aVSomeone asked me whether I stuck it in
p434
aVin order to deflect ire
p435
aVfrom discussions of gender and Nazism
p436
aVand race and so on. I won't comment on that.
p437
aVBut it certainly inspired
p438
aVan energetic reaction
p439
aVfrom many university professors.
p440
aa(lp441
VWell, the other hot button is parenting.
p442
aVAnd the starting point is the \u2014 for that discussion
p443
aVwas the fact that we have all
p444
aVbeen subject to the advice
p445
aVof the parenting industrial complex.
p446
aVNow, here is \u2014 here is a
p447
aVrepresentative quote from a besieged mother:
p448
aV"I'm overwhelmed with parenting advice.
p449
aVI'm supposed to do lots of physical activity with my kids
p450
aVso I can instill in them a physical fitness habit
p451
aVso they'll grow up to be healthy adults.
p452
aVAnd I'm supposed to do all kinds of intellectual play
p453
aVso they'll grow up smart.
p454
aVAnd there are all kinds of play \u2014 clay for finger dexterity,
p455
aVword games for reading success, large motor play,
p456
aVsmall motor play. I feel like I could devote my life
p457
aVto figuring out what to play with my kids."
p458
aVI think anyone who's recently been a parent can sympathize
p459

VWell, here's some sobering facts about parenting.
p462
aVMost studies of parenting on which this advice is based
p463
aVare useless. They're useless because they don't control
p464
aVfor heritability. They measure some correlation
p465
aVbetween what the parents do, how the children turn out
p466
aVand assume a causal relation:
p467
aVthat the parenting shaped the child.
p468
aVParents who talk a lot to their kids
p469
aVhave kids who grow up to be articulate,
p470
aVparents who spank their kids have kids who grow up
p471
aVto be violent and so on.
p472
aVAnd very few of them control for the possibility
p473
aVthat parents pass on genes for \u2014
p474
aVthat increase the chances a child will be articulate
p475
aVor violent and so on.
p476
aVUntil the studies are redone with adoptive children,
p477
aVwho provide an environment
p478
aVbut not genes to their kids,
p479
aVwe have no way of knowing whether these conclusions are valid.
p480
aa(lp481
VThe genetically controlled studies
p482
aVhave some sobering results.
p483
aVRemember the Mallifert twins:
p484
aVseparated at birth, then they meet in the patent office \u2014
p485
aVremarkably similar.
p486
aVWell, what would have happened if the Mallifert twins had grown up together?
p487
aVYou might think, well, then they'd be even more similar,
p488
aVbecause not only would they share their genes,
p489
aVbut they would also share their environment.
p490
aVThat would make them super-similar, right?
p491
aVWrong. Identical twins, or any siblings,
p492
aVwho are separated at birth are no less similar
p493
aVthan if they had grown up together.
p494
aVEverything that happens to you in a given home
p495
aVover all of those years
p496
aVappears to leave no permanent stamp
p497
aVon your personality or intellect.
p498
aVA complementary finding, from a completely different methodology,
p499
aVis that adopted siblings reared together \u2014
p500
aVthe mirror image of identical twins reared apart,
p501
aVthey share their parents, their home,
p502
aVtheir neighborhood,
p503
aVdon't share their genes \u2014 end up not similar at all.
p504
aVOK \u2014 two different bodies of research with a similar finding.
p505
aa(lp506
VWhat it suggests is that children are shaped
p507
aVnot by their parents over the long run,
p508
aVbut in part \u2014 only in part \u2014 by their genes,
p509
aVin part by their culture \u2014
p510
aVthe culture of the country at large
p511
aVand the children's own culture, namely their peer group \u2014
p512
aVas we heard from Jill Sobule earlier today,
p513
aVthat's what kids care about \u2014
p514
aVand, to a very large extent, larger than most people are prepared to acknowledge,
p515
aVby chance: chance events in the wiring of the brain in utero;
p516
aVchance events as you live your life.
p517
aa(lp518
VSo let me conclude
p519
aVwith just a remark
p520
aVto bring it back to the theme of choices.
p521
aVI think that the sciences of human nature \u2014
p522
aVbehavioral genetics, evolutionary psychology,
p523
aVneuroscience, cognitive science \u2014
p524
aVare going to, increasingly in the years to come,
p525
aVupset various dogmas,
p526
aVcareers and deeply-held political belief systems.
p527
aVAnd that presents us with a choice.
p528
aVThe choice is whether certain facts about humans,
p529
aVor topics, are to be considered taboos,
p530
aVforbidden knowledge, where we shouldn't go there
p531
aVbecause no good can come from it,
p532
aVor whether we should explore them honestly.
p533
aVI have my own
p534
aVanswer to that question,
p535
aVwhich comes from a great artist of the 19th century,
p536
aVAnton Chekhov, who said,
p537
aV"Man will become better when you show him
p538
aVwhat he is like."
p539
aVAnd I think that the argument
p540
aVcan't be put any more eloquently than that.
p541
aVThank you very much.
