VWe're 25, 26 years after
p4
aVthe advent of the Macintosh,
p5
aVwhich was an astoundingly seminal event
p6
aVin the history
p7
aVof human-machine interface
p8
aVand in computation in general.
p9
aVIt fundamentally changed the way
p10
aVthat people thought about computation,
p11
aVthought about computers,
p12
aVhow they used them and who and how many people were able to use them.
p13
aVIt was such a radical change, in fact,
p14
aVthat the early Macintosh development team
p15
aVin '82, '83, '84
p16
aVhad to write an entirely new operating system from the ground up.
p17
aVNow, this is an interesting little message,
p18
aVand it's a lesson that has since, I think,
p19
aVbeen forgotten or lost or something,
p20
aVand that is, namely, that the OS is the interface.
p21
aVThe interface is the OS.
p22
aVIt's like the land and the king (i.e. Arthur) they're inseparable, they are one.
p23
aVAnd to write a new operating system was not a capricious matter.
p24
aVIt wasn't just a matter of tuning up some graphics routines.
p25
aVThere were no graphics routines. There were no mouse drivers.
p26
aVSo it was a necessity.
p27
aa(lp28
VBut in the quarter-century since then,
p29
aVwe've seen all of the fundamental
p30
aVsupporting technologies go berserk.
p31
aVSo memory capacity and disk capacity
p32
aVhave been multiplied by something between 10,000 and a million.
p33
aVSame thing for processor speeds.
p34
aVNetworks, we didn't have networks at all
p35
aVat the time of the Macintosh's introduction,
p36
aVand that has become the single most salient aspect
p37
aVof how we live with computers.
p38
aVAnd, of course, graphics: Today
p39
aV84 dollars and 97 cents at Best Buy
p40
aVbuys you more graphics power
p41
aVthan you could have gotten for a million bucks from SGI only a decade ago.
p42
aVSo we've got that incredible ramp-up.
p43
aVThen, on the side, we've got the Web
p44
aVand, increasingly, the cloud,
p45
aVwhich is fantastic,
p46
aVbut also \u2014 in the regard in which an interface is fundamental \u2014
p47
aVkind of a distraction.
p48
aVSo we've forgotten to invent new interfaces.
p49
aVCertainly we've seen in recent years a lot of change in that regard,
p50
aVand people are starting to wake up about that.
p51
aVSo what happens next? Where do we go from there?
p52
aa(lp53
VThe problem, as we see it,
p54
aVhas to do with a single, simple word: "space,"
p55
aVor a single, simple phrase:
p56
aV"real world geometry."
p57
aVComputers and the programming languages
p58
aVthat we talk to them in, that we teach them in,
p59
aVare hideously insensate when it comes to space.
p60
aVThey don't understand real world space.
p61
aVIt's a funny thing because the rest of us occupy it quite frequently and quite well.
p62
aVThey also don't understand time, but that's a matter for a separate talk.
p63
aa(lp64
VSo what happens if you start to
p65
aVexplain space to them?
p66
aVOne thing you might get is something like the Luminous Room.
p67
aVThe Luminous Room is a system
p68
aVin which it's considered that
p69
aVinput and output spaces are co-located.
p70
aVThat's a strangely simple,
p71
aVand yet unexplored idea, right?
p72
aVWhen you use a mouse, your hand is down here on the mouse pad.
p73
aVIt's not even on the same plane as what you're talking about:
p74
aVThe pixels are up on the display.
p75
aVSo here was a room in which all the walls, floors, ceilings,
p76
aVpets, potted plants, whatever was in there,
p77
aVwere capable, not only of display but of sensing as well.
p78
aVAnd that means input and output are in the same space
p79
aVenabling stuff like this.
p80
aVThat's a digital storage in a physical container.
p81
aVThe contract is the same
p82
aVas with real word objects in real world containers.
p83
aVHas to come back out, whatever you put in.
p84
aVThis little design experiment
p85
aVthat was a small office here knew a few other tricks as well.
p86
aVIf you presented it with a chess board,
p87
aVit tried to figure out what you might mean by that.
p88
aVAnd if there was nothing for them to do,
p89
aVthe chess pieces eventually got bored
p90
aVand hopped away.
p91
aa(lp92
VThe academics who were overseeing this work
p93
aVthought that that was too frivolous,
p94
aVso we built deadly serious applications
p95
aVlike this optics prototyping workbench
p96
aVin which a toothpaste cap on a cardboard box
p97
aVbecomes a laser.
p98
aVThe beam splitters and lenses are represented by physical objects,
p99
aVand the system projects down the laser beam path.
p100
aVSo you've got an interface that has no interface.
p101
aVYou operate the world as you operate the real world,
p102
aVwhich is to say, with your hands.
p103
aVSimilarly, a digital wind tunnel with digital wind
p104
aVflowing from right to left \u2014
p105
aVnot that remarkable in a sense; we didn't invent the mathematics.
p106
aVBut if you displayed that on a CRT or flat panel display,
p107
aVit would be meaningless to hold up an arbitrary object,
p108
aVa real world object in that.
p109
aVHere, the real world merges with the simulation.
p110
aa(lp111
VAnd finally, to pull out all the stops,
p112
aVthis is a system called Urp, for urban planners,
p113
aVin which we give architects and urban planners back
p114
aVthe models that we confiscated
p115
aVwhen we insisted that they use CAD systems.
p116
aVAnd we make the machine meet them half way.
p117
aVIt projects down digital shadows, as you see here.
p118
aVAnd if you introduce tools like this inverse clock,
p119
aVthen you can control the sun's position in the sky.
p120
aVThat's 8 a.m. shadows.
p121
aVThey get a little shorter at 9 a.m.
p122
aVThere you are, swinging the sun around.
p123
aVShort shadows at noon and so forth.
p124
aVAnd we built up a series of tools like this.
p125
aVThere are inter-shadowing studies
p126
aVthat children can operate,
p127
aVeven though they don't know anything about urban planning:
p128
aVTo move a building, you simply reach out your hand and you move the building.
p129
aVA material wand makes the building
p130
aVinto a sort of Frank Gehry thing that reflects light in all directions.
p131
aVAre you blinding passers by and motorists on the freeways?
p132
aVA zoning tool connects distant structures, a building and a roadway.
p133
aVAre you going to get sued by the zoning commission? And so forth.
p134
aVNow, if these ideas seem familiar
p135
aVor perhaps even a little dated,
p136
aVthat's great; they should seem familiar.
p137
aa(lp138
VThis work is 15 years old.
p139
aVThis stuff was undertaken at MIT and the Media Lab
p140
aVunder the incredible direction of Professor Hiroshi Ishii,
p141
aVdirector of the Tangible Media Group.
p142
aVBut it was that work that was seen
p143
aVby Alex McDowell,
p144
aVone of the world's legendary production designers.
p145
aVBut Alex was preparing a little, sort of obscure, indie, arthouse film
p146
aVcalled "Minority Report" for Steven Spielberg,
p147
aVand invited us to come out from MIT
p148
aVand design the interfaces
p149
aVthat would appear in that film.
p150
aVAnd the great thing about it was
p151
aVthat Alex was so dedicated to the idea of verisimilitude,
p152
aVthe idea that the putative 2054
p153
aVthat we were painting in the film be believable,
p154
aVthat he allowed us to take on that design work
p155
aVas if it were an R&D effort.
p156
aVAnd the result is sort of
p157
aVgratifyingly perpetual.
p158
aVPeople still reference those sequences in "Minority Report"
p159
aVwhen they talk about new UI design.
p160
aVSo this led full circle, in a strange way,
p161
aVto build these ideas into what we believe
p162
aVis the necessary future of human machine interface:
p163
aVthe Spatial Operating Environment, we call it.
p164
aa(lp165
VSo here we have a bunch of stuff, some images.
p166
aVAnd, using a hand,
p167
aVwe can actually exercise six degrees of freedom,
p168
aVsix degrees of navigational control.
p169
aVAnd it's fun to fly through Mr. Beckett's eye.
p170
aVAnd you can come back out
p171
aVthrough the scary orangutan.
p172
aVAnd that's all well and good.
p173
aVLet's do something a little more difficult.
p174
aVHere, we have a whole bunch of disparate images.
p175
aVWe can fly around them.
p176
aVSo navigation is a fundamental issue.
p177
aVYou have to be able to navigate in 3D.
p178
aVMuch of what we want computers to help us with in the first place
p179
aVis inherently spatial.
p180
aVAnd the part that isn't spatial can often be spatialized
p181
aVto allow our wetware to make greater sense of it.
p182
aVNow we can distribute this stuff in many different ways.
p183
aVSo we can throw it out like that. Let's reset it.
p184
aVWe can organize it this way.
p185
aa(lp186
VAnd, of course, it's not just about navigation,
p187
aVbut about manipulation as well.
p188
aVSo if we don't like stuff,
p189
aVor we're intensely curious about
p190
aVErnst Haeckel's scientific falsifications,
p191
aVwe can pull them out like that.
p192
aVAnd then if it's time for analysis, we can pull back a little bit
p193
aVand ask for a different distribution.
p194
aVLet's just come down a bit
p195
aVand fly around.
p196
aVSo that's a different way to look at stuff.
p197
aVIf you're of a more analytical nature
p198
aVthen you might want, actually, to look at this
p199
aVas a color histogram.
p200
aVSo now we've got the stuff color-sorted,
p201
aVangle maps onto color.
p202
aVAnd now, if we want to select stuff,
p203
aV3D, space,
p204
aVthe idea that we're tracking hands in real space
p205
aVbecomes really important because we can reach in,
p206
aVnot in 2D, not in fake 2D, but in actual 3D.
p207
aVHere are some selection planes.
p208
aVAnd we'll perform this Boolean operation
p209
aVbecause we really love yellow and tapirs on green grass.
p210
aa(lp211
VSo, from there to the world of real work.
p212
aVHere's a logistics system,
p213
aVa small piece of one that we're currently building.
p214
aVThere're a lot of elements.
p215
aVAnd one thing that's very important is to combine traditional tabular data
p216
aVwith three-dimensional and geospatial information.
p217
aVSo here's a familiar place.
p218
aVAnd we'll bring this back here for a second.
p219
aVMaybe select a little bit of that.
p220
aVAnd bring out this graph.
p221
aVAnd we should, now,
p222
aVbe able to fly in here
p223
aVand have a closer look.
p224
aVThese are logistics elements
p225
aVthat are scattered across the United States.
p226
aa(lp227
VOne thing that three-dimensional interactions
p228
aVand the general idea of imbuing
p229
aVcomputation with space affords you
p230
aVis a final destruction of that unfortunate
p231
aVone-to-one pairing between human beings and computers.
p232
aVThat's the old way, that's the old mantra:
p233
aVone machine, one human, one mouse, one screen.
p234
aVWell, that doesn't really cut it anymore.
p235
aVIn the real world, we have people who collaborate;
p236
aVwe have people who have to work together,
p237
aVand we have many different displays.
p238
aVAnd we might want to look at these various images.
p239
aVWe might want to ask for some help.
p240
aa(lp241
VThe author of this new pointing device
p242
aVis sitting over there,
p243
aVso I can pull this from there to there.
p244
aVThese are unrelated machines, right?
p245
aVSo the computation is space soluble and network soluble.
p246
aVSo I'm going to leave that over there
p247
aVbecause I have a question for Paul.
p248
aVPaul is the designer of this wand, and maybe its easiest
p249
aVfor him to come over here and tell me in person what's going on.
p250
aVSo let me get some of these out of the way.
p251
aVLet's pull this apart:
p252
aVI'll go ahead and explode it.
p253
aVKevin, can you help?
p254
aVLet me see if I can help us find the circuit board.
p255
aVMind you, it's a sort of gratuitous field-stripping exercise,
p256
aVbut we do it in the lab all the time.
p257
aVAll right.
p258
aVSo collaborative work, whether it's immediately co-located
p259
aVor distant and distinct, is always important.
p260
aVAnd again, that stuff
p261
aVneeds to be undertaken in the context of space.
p262
aa(lp263
VAnd finally, I'd like to leave you with a glimpse
p264
aVthat takes us back to the world of imagery.
p265
aVThis is a system called TAMPER,
p266
aVwhich is a slightly whimsical look
p267
aVat what the future of editing
p268
aVand media manipulation systems might be.
p269
aVWe at Oblong believe that media should be
p270
aVaccessible in much more fine-grained form.
p271
aVSo we have a large number of movies
p272
aVstuck inside here.
p273
aVAnd let's just pick out a few elements.
p274
aVWe can zip through them
p275
aVas a possibility.
p276
aVWe can grab elements off the front,
p277
aVwhere upon they reanimate, come to life,
p278
aVand drag them down onto the table here.
p279
aVWe'll go over to Jacques Tati here
p280
aVand grab our blue friend
p281
aVand put him down on the table as well.
p282
aVWe may need more than one.
p283
aVAnd we probably need,
p284
aVwell, we probably need a cowboy
p285
aVto be quite honest.
p286
aV(Laughter)
p287
aVYeah, let's
p288
aVtake that one.
p289
aV(Laughter)
p290
aVYou see, cowboys and French farce people
p291
aVdon't go well together, and the system knows that.
p292
aa(lp293
VLet me leave with one final thought,
p294
aVand that is that
p295
aVone of the greatest English language writers
p296
aVof the last three decades
p297
aVsuggested that great art is always a gift.
p298
aVAnd he wasn't talking about whether the novel costs 24.95 [dollars],
p299
aVor whether you have to spring 70 million bucks
p300
aVto buy the stolen Vermeer;
p301
aVhe was talking about the circumstances of its creation
p302
aVand of its existence.
p303
aVAnd I think that it's time that we asked
p304
aVfor the same from technology.
p305
aVTechnology is capable of
p306
aVexpressing and being imbued with
p307
aVa certain generosity,
p308
aVand we need to demand that, in fact.
p309
aVFor some of this kind of technology,
p310
aVground center is
p311
aVa combination of design, which is crucially important.
p312
aVWe can't have advances in technology any longer
p313
aVunless design is integrated from the very start.
p314
aVAnd, as well, as of efficacy, agency.
p315
aVWe're, as human beings, the creatures that create,
p316
aVand we should make sure that our machines aid us in that task
p317
aVand are built in that same image.
p318
aa(lp319
VSo I will leave you with that. Thank you.
p320
aa(lp321

p322
aa(lp323
VChris Anderson: So to ask the obvious question \u2014
p324
aVactually this is from Bill Gates \u2014
p325
aVwhen? (John Underkoffler: When?)
p326
aVCA: When real? When for us, not just in a lab and on a stage?
p327
aVCan it be for every man, or is this just for corporations and movie producers?
p328
aa(lp329
VJU: No, it has to be for every human being.
p330
aVThat's our goal entirely.
p331
aVWe won't have succeeded
p332
aVunless we take that next big step.
p333
aVI mean it's been 25 years.
p334
aVCan there really be only one interface? There can't.
p335
aa(lp336
VCA: But does that mean that, at your desk or in your home,
p337
aVyou need projectors, cameras?
p338
aVYou know, how can it work?
p339
aa(lp340
VJU: No, this stuff will be built into the bezel of every display.
p341
aVIt'll be built into architecture.
p342
aVThe gloves go away in a matter of months or years.
p343
aVSo this is the inevitability about it.
p344
aa(lp345
VCA: So, in your mind, five years time,
p346
aVsomeone can buy this as part of
p347
aVa standard computer interface?
p348
aa(lp349
VJU: I think in five years time when you buy a computer,
p350
aVyou'll get this.
p351
aa(lp352
VCA: Well that's cool.
p353
aV(Applause)
p354
aVThe world has a habit of surprising us as to how these things are actually used.
p355
aVWhat do you think, what in your mind is the first killer app for this?
p356
aa(lp357
VJU: That's a good question, and we ask ourselves that every day.
p358
aVAt the moment, our early-adopter customers \u2014
p359
aVand these systems are deployed out in the real world \u2014
p360
aVdo all the big data intensive, data heavy problems with it.
p361
aVSo, whether it's logistics and supply chain management
p362
aVor natural gas and resource extraction,
p363
aVfinancial services, pharmaceuticals, bioinformatics,
p364
aVthose are the topics right now, but that's not a killer app.
p365
aVAnd I understand what you're asking.
p366
aa(lp367
VCA: C'mon, c'mon. Martial arts, games. C'mon.
p368
aV(Laughter)
p369
aVJohn, thank you for making science-fiction real.
p370
aa(lp371
