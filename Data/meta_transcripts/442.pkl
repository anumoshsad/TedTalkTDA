VI became an inventor by accident.
p4
aVI was out of the air force in 1956. No, no, that's not true:
p5
aVI went in in 1956, came out in 1959,
p6
aVwas working at the University of Washington,
p7
aVand I came up with an idea, from reading a magazine article,
p8
aVfor a new kind of a phonograph tone arm.
p9
aVNow, that was before cassette tapes, C.D.s, DVDs \u2014
p10
aVany of the cool stuff we've got now.
p11
aVAnd it was an arm that,
p12
aVinstead of hinging and pivoting as it went across the record,
p13
aVwent straight: a radial, linear tracking tone arm.
p14
aVAnd it was the hardest invention I ever made, but it got me started,
p15
aVand I got really lucky after that.
p16
aa(lp17
VAnd without giving you too much of a tirade,
p18
aVI want to talk to you about an invention I brought with me today:
p19
aVmy 44th invention. No, that's not true either.
p20
aVGolly, I'm just totally losing it.
p21
aVMy 44th patent; about the 15th invention.
p22
aVI call this hypersonic sound.
p23
aVI'm going to play it for you in a couple minutes,
p24
aVbut I want to make an analogy before I do
p25
aVto this.
p26
aVI usually show this hypersonic sound and people will say,
p27
aVThat's really cool, but what's it good for?
p28
aVAnd I say, What is the light bulb good for?
p29
aVSound, light: I'm going to draw the analogy.
p30
aVWhen Edison invented the light bulb, pretty much looked like this.
p31
aVHasn't changed that much.
p32
aVLight came out of it in every direction.
p33
aVBefore the light bulb was invented,
p34
aVpeople had figured out how to put a reflector behind it,
p35
aVfocus it a little bit;
p36
aVput lenses in front of it,
p37
aVfocus it a little bit better.
p38
aVUltimately we figured out how to make things like lasers
p39
aVthat were totally focused.
p40
aa(lp41
VNow, think about where the world would be today
p42
aVif we had the light bulb,
p43
aVbut you couldn't focus light;
p44
aVif when you turned one on it just went wherever it wanted to.
p45
aVThat's the way loudspeakers pretty much are.
p46
aVYou turn on the loudspeaker,
p47
aVand after almost 80 years of having those gadgets,
p48
aVthe sound just kind of goes where it wants.
p49
aVEven when you're standing in front of a megaphone,
p50
aVit's pretty much every direction.
p51
aVA little bit of differential, but not much.
p52
aVIf the light bulb was the way the speaker is,
p53
aVand you couldn't focus or sharpen the edges or define it,
p54
aVwe wouldn't have that, or movies in general,
p55
aVor computers, or T.V. sets,
p56
aVor C.D.s, or DVDs \u2014 and just go down the list
p57
aVof what the importance is
p58
aVof being able to focus light.
p59
aa(lp60
VNow, after almost 80 years of having sound,
p61
aVI thought it was about time that we figure out
p62
aVa way to put sound where you want to.
p63
aVI have a couple of units.
p64
aVThat guy there was made for a demo I did yesterday early in the day
p65
aVfor a big car maker in Detroit who wants to put them in a car \u2014
p66
aVsmall version, over your head \u2014
p67
aVso that you can actually get binaural sound in a car.
p68
aVWhat if I could aim sound the way I aim light?
p69
aa(lp70
VI got this waterfall I recorded in my back yard.
p71
aVNow, you're not going to hear a thing unless it hits you.
p72
aVMaybe if I hit the side wall it will bounce around the room.
p73
aV(Applause)
p74
aVThe sound is being made right next to your ears. Is that cool?
p75
aV(Applause)
p76
aVBecause I have some limited time, I'll cut it off for a second,
p77
aVand tell you about how it works and what it's good for.
p78
aa(lp79
VCourse, like light, it's great to be able to put sound
p80
aVto highlight a clothing rack, or the cornflakes, or the toothpaste,
p81
aVor a talking plaque in a movie theater lobby.
p82
aVSony's got an idea \u2014 Sony's our biggest customers right now.
p83
aVThey tried this back in the '60s
p84
aVand were too smart, and so they gave up.
p85
aVBut they want to use it \u2014 seriously.
p86
aVThere's a mix an inventor has to have.
p87
aVYou have to be kind of smart,
p88
aVand though I did not graduate from college doesn't mean I'm stupid,
p89
aVbecause you cannot be stupid and do very much in the world today.
p90
aVToo many other smart people out there. So.
p91
aVI just happened to get my education in a little different way.
p92
aVI'm not at all against education.
p93
aVI think it's wonderful; I think sometimes people,
p94
aVwhen they get educated, lose it:
p95
aVthey get so smart they're unwilling to look at things that they know better than.
p96
aVAnd we're living in a great time right now,
p97
aVbecause almost everything's being explored anew.
p98
aVI have this little slogan that I use a lot, which is:
p99
aVvirtually nothing \u2014
p100
aVand I mean this honestly \u2014
p101
aVhas been invented yet.
p102
aVWe're just starting.
p103
aVWe're just starting to really discover the laws of nature and science and physics.
p104
aVAnd this is, I hope, a little piece of it.
p105
aa(lp106
VSony's got this vision back \u2014 to get myself on track \u2014
p107
aVthat when you stand in the checkout line in the supermarket,
p108
aVyou're going to watch a new T.V. channel.
p109
aVThey know that when you watch T.V. at home,
p110
aVbecause there are so many choices
p111
aVyou can change channels, miss their commercials.
p112
aVA hundred and fifty-one million people every day stand in the line at the supermarket.
p113
aVNow, they've tried this a couple years ago and it failed,
p114
aVbecause the checker gets tired of hearing the same message
p115
aVevery 20 minutes, and reaches out, turns off the sound.
p116
aVAnd, you know, if the sound isn't there, the sale typically isn't made.
p117
aVFor instance, like, when you're on an airplane, they show the movie,
p118
aVyou get to watch it for free;
p119
aVwhen you want to hear the sound, you pay.
p120
aVAnd so ABC and Sony have devised this new thing
p121
aVwhere when you step in the line in the supermarket \u2014
p122
aVinitially it'll be Safeways. It is Safeways;
p123
aVthey're trying this in three parts of the country right now \u2014
p124
aVyou'll be watching TV.
p125
aa(lp126
VAnd hopefully they'll be sensitive
p127
aVthat they don't want to offend you with just one more outlet.
p128
aVBut what's great about it, from the tests that have been done, is,
p129
aVif you don't want to hear it,
p130
aVyou take about one step to the side and you don't hear it.
p131
aVSo, we create silence as much as we create sound.
p132
aVATMs that talk to you; nobody else hears it.
p133
aVSit in bed, two in the morning, watch TV;
p134
aVyour spouse, or someone, is next to you, asleep;
p135
aVdoesn't hear it, doesn't wake up.
p136
aVWe're also working on noise canceling things like snoring, noise from automobiles.
p137
aa(lp138
VI have been really lucky with this technology:
p139
aVall of a sudden as it is ready, the world is ready to accept it.
p140
aVThey have literally beat a path to our door.
p141
aVWe've been selling it since about last September, October,
p142
aVand it's been immensely gratifying.
p143
aVIf you're interested in what it costs \u2014 I'm not selling them today \u2014
p144
aVbut this unit, with the electronics and everything,
p145
aVif you buy one, is around a thousand bucks.
p146
aVWe expect by this time next year,
p147
aVit'll be hundreds, a few hundred bucks, to buy it.
p148
aVIt's not any more pricey than regular electronics.
p149
aa(lp150
VNow, when I played it for you, you didn't hear the thunderous bass.
p151
aVThis unit that I played goes from about 200 hertz to above the range of hearing.
p152
aVIt's actually emitting ultrasound \u2014 low-level ultrasound \u2014
p153
aVthat's about 100,000 vibrations per second.
p154
aVAnd the sound that you're hearing,
p155
aVunlike a regular speaker on which all the sound is made on the face,
p156
aVis made out in front of it, in the air.
p157
aVThe air is not linear, as we've always been taught.
p158
aVYou turn up the volume just a little bit \u2014
p159
aVI'm talking about a little over 80 decibels \u2014
p160
aVand all of a sudden the air begins to corrupt signals you propagate.
p161
aVHere's why: the speed of sound is not a constant. It's fairly slow.
p162
aVIt changes with temperature and with barometric pressure.
p163
aa(lp164
VNow, imagine, if you will, without getting too technical,
p165
aVI'm making a little sine wave here in the air.
p166
aVWell, if I turn up the amplitude too much,
p167
aVI'm having an effect on the pressure,
p168
aVwhich means during the making of that sine wave,
p169
aVthe speed at which it is propagating is shifting.
p170
aVAll of audio as we know it
p171
aVis an attempt to be more and more perfectly linear.
p172
aVLinearity means higher quality sound.
p173
aVHypersonic sound is exactly the opposite:
p174
aVit's 100 percent based on non-linearity.
p175
aVAn effect happens in the air, it's a corrupting effect of the sound \u2014
p176
aVthe ultrasound in this case \u2014 that's emitted,
p177
aVbut it's so predictable
p178
aVthat you can produce very precise audio out of that effect.
p179
aa(lp180
VNow, the question is, where's the sound made?
p181
aVInstead of being made on the face of the cone,
p182
aVit's made at literally billions of little independent points
p183
aValong this narrow column in the air,
p184
aVand so when I aim it towards you,
p185
aVwhat you hear is made right next to your ears.
p186
aVI said we can shorten the column,
p187
aVwe can spread it out to cover the couch.
p188
aVI can put it so that one ear hears one speaker,
p189
aVthe other ear hears the other. That's true binaural sound.
p190
aVWhen you listen to stereo on your home system,
p191
aVyour both ears hear both speakers.
p192
aVTurn on the left speaker sometime
p193
aVand notice you're hearing it also in your right ear.
p194
aVSo, the stage is more restricted \u2014
p195
aVthe sound stage that's supposed to spread out in front of you.
p196
aVBecause the sound is made in the air along this column,
p197
aVit does not follow the inverse square law,
p198
aVwhich says it drops off about two thirds
p199
aVevery time you double the distance:
p200
aV6dB every time you go from one meter, for instance, to two meters.
p201
aVThat means you go to a rock concert or a symphony,
p202
aVand the guy in the front row gets the same level
p203
aVas the guy in the back row, now, all of a sudden.
p204
aVIsn't that terrific?
p205
aa(lp206
VSo, we've been, as I say, very successful, very lucky,
p207
aVin having companies catch the vision of this,
p208
aVfrom cars \u2014 car makers who want to put a stereo system in the front for the kids,
p209
aVand a separate system in the back \u2014
p210
aVoh, no, the kids aren't driving today.
p211
aV(Laughter)
p212
aVI was seeing if you were listening.
p213
aVActually, I haven't had breakfast yet.
p214
aVA stereo system in the front for mom and dad,
p215
aVand maybe there's a little DVD player in the back for the kids,
p216
aVand the parents don't want to be bothered with that,
p217
aVor their rap music or whatever.
p218
aVSo, again, this idea of being able to put sound anywhere you want to
p219
aVis really starting to catch on.
p220
aVIt also works for transmitting and communicating data.
p221
aVIt also works five times better underwater.
p222
aa(lp223
VWe've got the military \u2014 have just deployed some of these into Iraq,
p224
aVwhere you can put fake troop movements
p225
aVquarter of a mile away on a hillside.
p226
aV(Laughter)
p227
aVOr you can whisper in the ear of a supposed terrorist some Biblical verse.
p228
aV(Laughter)
p229
aVI'm serious. And they have these infrared devices
p230
aVthat can look at their countenance,
p231
aVand see a fraction of a degree Kelvin in temperature shift
p232
aVfrom 100 yards away when they play this thing.
p233
aVAnd so, another way of hopefully determining who's friendly and who isn't.
p234
aVWe make a version with this which puts out 155 decibels.
p235
aVPain is 120.
p236
aVSo it allows you to go nearly a mile away and communicate with people,
p237
aVand there can be a public beach just off to the side,
p238
aVand they don't even know it's turned on.
p239
aVWe sell those to the military presently for about 70,000 dollars,
p240
aVand they're buying them as fast as we can make them.
p241
aVWe put it on a turret with a camera, so that when they shoot at you,
p242
aVyou're over there, and it's there.
p243
aa(lp244
VI have a bunch of other inventions.
p245
aVI invented a plasma antenna, to shift gears.
p246
aVLooked up at the ceiling of my office one day \u2014
p247
aVI was working on a ground-penetrating radar project \u2014
p248
aVand my physicist CEO came in and said, "We have a real problem.
p249
aVWe're using very short wavelengths.
p250
aVWe've got a problem with the antenna ringing.
p251
aVWhen you run very short wavelengths,
p252
aVlike a tuning fork the antenna resonates,
p253
aVand there's more energy coming out of the antenna
p254
aVthan there is the backscatter from the ground
p255
aVthat we're trying to analyze, taking too much processing."
p256
aVI says, "Why don't we make an antenna that only exists when you want it?
p257
aVTurn it on; turn it off.
p258
aVThat's a fluorescent tube refined."
p259
aVI just sold that for a million and a half dollars, cash.
p260
aVI took it back to the Pentagon after it got declassified,
p261
aVwhen the patent issued, and told the people back there about it,
p262
aVand they laughed, and then I took them back a demo and they bought.
p263
aV(Laughter)
p264
aa(lp265
VAny of you ever wore a Jabber headphone \u2014 the little cell headphones?
p266
aVThat's my invention. I sold that for seven million dollars.
p267
aVBig mistake: it just sold for 80 million dollars two years ago.
p268
aVI actually drew that up on a little crummy Mac computer
p269
aVin my attic at my house,
p270
aVand one of the many designs which they have now
p271
aVis still the same design I drew way back when.
p272
aa(lp273
VSo, I've been really lucky as an inventor.
p274
aVI'm the happiest guy you're ever going to meet.
p275
aVAnd my dad died before he realized anybody in the family
p276
aVwould maybe, hopefully, make something out of themselves.
p277
aVYou've been a great audience. I know I've jumped all over the place.
p278
aVI usually figure out what my talk is when I get up in front of a group.
p279
aa(lp280
VLet me give you, in the last minute,
p281
aVone more quick demo of this guy,
p282
aVfor those of you that haven't heard it.
p283
aVCan never tell if it's on.
p284
aVIf you haven't heard it, raise your hand.
p285
aVGetting it over there?
p286
aVGet the cameraman.
p287
aVYeah, there you go.
p288
aVI've got a Coke can opening that's right in your head; that's really cool.
p289
aVThank you once again.
p290
aVAppreciate it very much.
