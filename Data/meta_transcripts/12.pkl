VThank you. It's really an honor and a privilege to be here
p4
aVspending my last day as a teenager.
p5
aVToday I want to talk to you about the future, but
p6
aVfirst I'm going to tell you a bit about the past.
p7
aVMy story starts way before I was born.
p8
aVMy grandmother was on a train to Auschwitz, the death camp.
p9
aVAnd she was going along the tracks, and the tracks split.
p10
aVAnd somehow \u2014 we don't really know exactly the whole story \u2014 but
p11
aVthe train took the wrong track and went to a work camp rather than the death camp.
p12
aVMy grandmother survived and married my grandfather.
p13
aVThey were living in Hungary, and my mother was born.
p14
aVAnd when my mother was two years old,
p15
aVthe Hungarian revolution was raging, and they decided to escape Hungary.
p16
aVThey got on a boat, and yet another divergence \u2014
p17
aVthe boat was either going to Canada or to Australia.
p18
aVThey got on and didn't know where they were going, and ended up in Canada.
p19
aVSo, to make a long story short, they came to Canada.
p20
aVMy grandmother was a chemist. She worked at the Banting Institute in Toronto,
p21
aVand at 44 she died of stomach cancer. I never met my grandmother,
p22
aVbut I carry on her name \u2014 her exact name, Eva Vertes \u2014
p23
aVand I like to think I carry on her scientific passion, too.
p24
aa(lp25
VI found this passion not far from here, actually, when I was nine years old.
p26
aVMy family was on a road trip and we were in the Grand Canyon.
p27
aVAnd I had never been a reader when I was young \u2014
p28
aVmy dad had tried me with the Hardy Boys; I tried Nancy Drew;
p29
aVI tried all that \u2014 and I just didn't like reading books.
p30
aVAnd my mother bought this book when we were at the Grand Canyon
p31
aVcalled "The Hot Zone." It was all about the outbreak of the Ebola virus.
p32
aVAnd something about it just kind of drew me towards it.
p33
aVThere was this big sort of bumpy-looking virus on the cover,
p34
aVand I just wanted to read it. I picked up that book,
p35
aVand as we drove from the edge of the Grand Canyon
p36
aVto Big Sur, and to, actually, here where we are today, in Monterey,
p37
aVI read that book, and from when I was reading that book,
p38
aVI knew that I wanted to have a life in medicine.
p39
aVI wanted to be like the explorers I'd read about in the book,
p40
aVwho went into the jungles of Africa,
p41
aVwent into the research labs and just tried to figure out
p42
aVwhat this deadly virus was. So from that moment on, I read every medical book
p43
aVI could get my hands on, and I just loved it so much.
p44
aVI was a passive observer of the medical world.
p45
aa(lp46
VIt wasn't until I entered high school that I thought,
p47
aV"Maybe now, you know \u2014 being a big high school kid \u2014
p48
aVI can maybe become an active part of this big medical world."
p49
aVI was 14, and I emailed professors at the local university
p50
aVto see if maybe I could go work in their lab. And hardly anyone responded.
p51
aVBut I mean, why would they respond to a 14-year-old, anyway?
p52
aVAnd I got to go talk to one professor, Dr. Jacobs,
p53
aVwho accepted me into the lab.
p54
aVAt that time, I was really interested in neuroscience
p55
aVand wanted to do a research project in neurology \u2014
p56
aVspecifically looking at the effects of heavy metals on the developing nervous system.
p57
aVSo I started that, and worked in his lab for a year,
p58
aVand found the results that I guess you'd expect to find
p59
aVwhen you feed fruit flies heavy metals \u2014 that it really, really impaired the nervous system.
p60
aVThe spinal cord had breaks. The neurons were crossing in every which way.
p61
aVAnd from then I wanted to look not at impairment, but at prevention of impairment.
p62
aa(lp63
VSo that's what led me to Alzheimer's. I started reading about Alzheimer's
p64
aVand tried to familiarize myself with the research,
p65
aVand at the same time when I was in the \u2014
p66
aVI was reading in the medical library one day, and I read this article
p67
aVabout something called "purine derivatives."
p68
aVAnd they seemed to have cell growth-promoting properties.
p69
aVAnd being naive about the whole field, I kind of thought,
p70
aV"Oh, you have cell death in Alzheimer's
p71
aVwhich is causing the memory deficit, and then you have this compound \u2014
p72
aVpurine derivatives \u2014 that are promoting cell growth."
p73
aVAnd so I thought, "Maybe if it can promote cell growth,
p74
aVit can inhibit cell death, too."
p75
aVAnd so that's the project that I pursued for that year,
p76
aVand it's continuing now as well,
p77
aVand found that a specific purine derivative called "guanidine"
p78
aVhad inhibited the cell growth by approximately 60 percent.
p79
aVSo I presented those results at the International Science Fair,
p80
aVwhich was just one of the most amazing experiences of my life.
p81
aVAnd there I was awarded "Best in the World in Medicine,"
p82
aVwhich allowed me to get in, or at least get a foot in the door of the big medical world.
p83
aa(lp84
VAnd from then on, since I was now in this huge exciting world,
p85
aVI wanted to explore it all. I wanted it all at once, but knew I couldn't really get that.
p86
aVAnd I stumbled across something called "cancer stem cells."
p87
aVAnd this is really what I want to talk to you about today \u2014 about cancer.
p88
aVAt first when I heard of cancer stem cells,
p89
aVI didn't really know how to put the two together. I'd heard of stem cells,
p90
aVand I'd heard of them as the panacea of the future \u2014
p91
aVthe therapy of many diseases to come in the future, perhaps.
p92
aVBut I'd heard of cancer as the most feared disease of our time,
p93
aVso how did the good and bad go together?
p94
aVLast summer I worked at Stanford University, doing some research on cancer stem cells.
p95
aVAnd while I was doing this, I was reading the cancer literature,
p96
aVtrying to \u2014 again \u2014 familiarize myself with this new medical field.
p97
aVAnd it seemed that tumors actually begin from a stem cell.
p98
aVThis fascinated me. The more I read, the more I looked at cancer differently
p99
aVand almost became less fearful of it.
p100
aa(lp101
VIt seems that cancer is a direct result to injury.
p102
aVIf you smoke, you damage your lung tissue, and then lung cancer arises.
p103
aVIf you drink, you damage your liver, and then liver cancer occurs.
p104
aVAnd it was really interesting \u2014 there were articles correlating
p105
aVif you have a bone fracture, and then bone cancer arises.
p106
aVBecause what stem cells are \u2014 they're these
p107
aVphenomenal cells that really have the ability to differentiate
p108
aVinto any type of tissue.
p109
aVSo, if the body is sensing that you have damage to an organ
p110
aVand then it's initiating cancer, it's almost as if this is a repair response.
p111
aVAnd the cancer, the body is saying the lung tissue is damaged,
p112
aVwe need to repair the lung. And cancer is originating in the lung
p113
aVtrying to repair \u2014 because you have this excessive proliferation
p114
aVof these remarkable cells that really have the potential to become lung tissue.
p115
aVBut it's almost as if the body has originated this ingenious response,
p116
aVbut can't quite control it.
p117
aVIt hasn't yet become fine-tuned enough to finish what has been initiated.
p118
aVSo this really, really fascinated me.
p119
aa(lp120
VAnd I really think that we can't think about cancer \u2014
p121
aVlet alone any disease \u2014 in such black-and-white terms.
p122
aVIf we eliminate cancer the way we're trying to do now, with chemotherapy and radiation,
p123
aVwe're bombarding the body or the cancer with toxins, or with radiation, trying to kill it.
p124
aVIt's almost as if we're getting back to this starting point.
p125
aVWe're removing the cancer cells, but we're revealing the previous damage
p126
aVthat the body has tried to fix.
p127
aVShouldn't we think about manipulation, rather than elimination?
p128
aVIf somehow we can cause these cells to differentiate \u2014
p129
aVto become bone tissue, lung tissue, liver tissue,
p130
aVwhatever that cancer has been put there to do \u2014
p131
aVit would be a repair process. We'd end up better than we were before cancer.
p132
aVSo, this really changed my view of looking at cancer.
p133
aVAnd while I was reading all these articles about cancer,
p134
aVit seemed that the articles \u2014 a lot of them \u2014 focused on, you know,
p135
aVthe genetics of breast cancer, and the genesis
p136
aVand the progression of breast cancer \u2014
p137
aVtracking the cancer through the body, tracing where it is, where it goes.
p138
aa(lp139
VBut it struck me that I'd never heard of cancer of the heart,
p140
aVor cancer of any skeletal muscle for that matter.
p141
aVAnd skeletal muscle constitutes 50 percent of our body,
p142
aVor over 50 percent of our body. And so at first I kind of thought,
p143
aV"Well, maybe there's some obvious explanation
p144
aVwhy skeletal muscle doesn't get cancer \u2014 at least not that I know of."
p145
aVSo, I looked further into it, found as many articles as I could,
p146
aVand it was amazing \u2014 because it turned out that it was very rare.
p147
aVSome articles even went as far as to say that skeletal muscle tissue
p148
aVis resistant to cancer, and furthermore, not only to cancer,
p149
aVbut of metastases going to skeletal muscle.
p150
aVAnd what metastases are is when the tumor \u2014
p151
aVwhen a piece \u2014 breaks off and travels through the blood stream
p152
aVand goes to a different organ. That's what a metastasis is.
p153
aVIt's the part of cancer that is the most dangerous.
p154
aVIf cancer was localized, we could likely remove it,
p155
aVor somehow \u2014 you know, it's contained. It's very contained.
p156
aVBut once it starts moving throughout the body, that's when it becomes deadly.
p157
aVSo the fact that not only did cancer not seem to originate in skeletal muscles,
p158
aVbut cancer didn't seem to go to skeletal muscle \u2014
p159
aVthere seemed to be something here.
p160
aVSo these articles were saying, you know, "Skeletal \u2014
p161
aVmetastasis to skeletal muscle \u2014 is very rare."
p162
aVBut it was left at that. No one seemed to be asking why.
p163
aa(lp164
VSo I decided to ask why. At first \u2014 the first thing I did
p165
aVwas I emailed some professors who
p166
aVspecialized in skeletal muscle physiology, and pretty much said,
p167
aV"Hey, it seems like cancer doesn't really go to skeletal muscle.
p168
aVIs there a reason for this?" And a lot of the replies I got were that
p169
aVmuscle is terminally differentiated tissue.
p170
aVMeaning that you have muscle cells, but they're not dividing,
p171
aVso it doesn't seem like a good target for cancer to hijack.
p172
aVBut then again, this fact that the metastases
p173
aVdidn't go to skeletal muscle made that seem unlikely.
p174
aVAnd furthermore, that nervous tissue \u2014 brain \u2014 gets cancer,
p175
aVand brain cells are also terminally differentiated.
p176
aVSo I decided to ask why. And here's some of, I guess, my hypotheses
p177
aVthat I'll be starting to investigate this May at the Sylvester Cancer Institute in Miami.
p178
aVAnd I guess I'll keep investigating until I get the answers.
p179
aVBut I know that in science, once you get the answers,
p180
aVinevitably you're going to have more questions.
p181
aVSo I guess you could say that I'll probably be doing this for the rest of my life.
p182
aa(lp183
VSome of my hypotheses are that
p184
aVwhen you first think about skeletal muscle,
p185
aVthere's a lot of blood vessels going to skeletal muscle.
p186
aVAnd the first thing that makes me think is that
p187
aVblood vessels are like highways for the tumor cells.
p188
aVTumor cells can travel through the blood vessels.
p189
aVAnd you think, the more highways there are in a tissue,
p190
aVthe more likely it is to get cancer or to get metastases.
p191
aVSo first of all I thought, you know, "Wouldn't it be favorable
p192
aVto cancer getting to skeletal muscle?" And as well,
p193
aVcancer tumors require a process called angiogenesis,
p194
aVwhich is really, the tumor recruits the blood vessels to itself
p195
aVto supply itself with nutrients so it can grow.
p196
aVWithout angiogenesis, the tumor remains the size of a pinpoint and it's not harmful.
p197
aVSo angiogenesis is really a central process to the pathogenesis of cancer.
p198
aa(lp199
VAnd one article that really stood out to me
p200
aVwhen I was just reading about this, trying to figure out why cancer doesn't go to skeletal
p201
aVmuscle, was that it had reported 16 percent of micro-metastases
p202
aVto skeletal muscle upon autopsy.
p203
aV16 percent! Meaning that there were these pinpoint tumors in skeletal muscle,
p204
aVbut only .16 percent of actual metastases \u2014
p205
aVsuggesting that maybe skeletal muscle is able to control the angiogenesis,
p206
aVis able to control the tumors recruiting these blood vessels.
p207
aVWe use skeletal muscles so much. It's the one portion of our body \u2014
p208
aVour heart's always beating. We're always moving our muscles.
p209
aVIs it possible that muscle somehow intuitively knows
p210
aVthat it needs this blood supply? It needs to be constantly contracting,
p211
aVso therefore it's almost selfish. It's grabbing its blood vessels for itself.
p212
aVTherefore, when a tumor comes into skeletal muscle tissue,
p213
aVit can't get a blood supply, and can't grow.
p214
aa(lp215
VSo this suggests that maybe if there is an anti-angiogenic factor
p216
aVin skeletal muscle \u2014 or perhaps even more,
p217
aVan angiogenic routing factor, so it can actually direct where the blood vessels grow \u2014
p218
aVthis could be a potential future therapy for cancer.
p219
aVAnd another thing that's really interesting is that
p220
aVthere's this whole \u2014 the way tumors move throughout the body,
p221
aVit's a very complex system \u2014 and there's something called the chemokine network.
p222
aVAnd chemokines are essentially chemical attractants,
p223
aVand they're the stop and go signals for cancer.
p224
aVSo a tumor expresses chemokine receptors,
p225
aVand another organ \u2014 a distant organ somewhere in the body \u2014
p226
aVwill have the corresponding chemokines,
p227
aVand the tumor will see these chemokines and migrate towards it.
p228
aVIs it possible that skeletal muscle doesn't express this type of molecules?
p229
aVAnd the other really interesting thing is that
p230
aVwhen skeletal muscle \u2014 there's been several reports that when skeletal
p231
aVmuscle is injured, that's what correlates with metastases going to skeletal muscle.
p232
aa(lp233
VAnd, furthermore, when skeletal muscle is injured,
p234
aVthat's what causes chemokines \u2014 these signals saying,
p235
aV"Cancer, you can come to me," the "go signs" for the tumors \u2014
p236
aVit causes them to highly express these chemokines.
p237
aVSo, there's so much interplay here.
p238
aVI mean, there are so many possibilities
p239
aVfor why tumors don't go to skeletal muscle.
p240
aVBut it seems like by investigating, by attacking cancer,
p241
aVby searching where cancer is not, there has got to be something \u2014
p242
aVthere's got to be something \u2014 that's making this tissue resistant to tumors.
p243
aVAnd can we utilize \u2014 can we take this property,
p244
aVthis compound, this receptor, whatever it is that's controlling these
p245
aVanti-tumor properties and apply it to cancer therapy in general?
p246
aVNow, one thing that kind of ties the resistance of skeletal muscle to cancer \u2014
p247
aVto the cancer as a repair response gone out of control in the body \u2014
p248
aVis that skeletal muscle has a factor in it called "MyoD."
p249
aVAnd what MyoD essentially does is, it causes cells to differentiate
p250
aVinto muscle cells. So this compound, MyoD,
p251
aVhas been tested on a lot of different cell types and been shown to
p252
aVactually convert this variety of cell types into skeletal muscle cells.
p253
aVSo, is it possible that the tumor cells are going to the skeletal muscle tissue,
p254
aVbut once in contact inside the skeletal muscle tissue,
p255
aVMyoD acts upon these tumor cells and causes them
p256
aVto become skeletal muscle cells?
p257
aVMaybe tumor cells are being disguised as skeletal muscle cells,
p258
aVand this is why it seems as if it is so rare.
p259
aa(lp260
VIt's not harmful; it has just repaired the muscle.
p261
aVMuscle is constantly being used \u2014 constantly being damaged.
p262
aVIf every time we tore a muscle
p263
aVor every time we stretched a muscle or moved in a wrong way,
p264
aVcancer occurred \u2014 I mean, everybody would have cancer almost.
p265
aVAnd I hate to say that. But it seems as though muscle cell,
p266
aVpossibly because of all its use, has adapted
p267
aVfaster than other body tissues to respond to injury,
p268
aVto fine-tune this repair response and actually be able to finish the process
p269
aVwhich the body wants to finish. I really believe that the human body is very,
p270
aVvery smart, and we can't counteract something the body is saying to do.
p271
aa(lp272
VIt's different when a bacteria comes into the body \u2014
p273
aVthat's a foreign object \u2014 we want that out.
p274
aVBut when the body is actually initiating a process
p275
aVand we're calling it a disease, it doesn't seem as though elimination is
p276
aVthe right solution. So even to go from there, it's possible, although far-fetched,
p277
aVthat in the future we could almost think of cancer being used as a therapy.
p278
aVIf those diseases where tissues are deteriorating \u2014
p279
aVfor example Alzheimer's, where the brain, the brain cells, die
p280
aVand we need to restore new brain cells, new functional brain cells \u2014
p281
aVwhat if we could, in the future, use cancer? A tumor \u2014
p282
aVput it in the brain and cause it to differentiate into brain cells?
p283
aa(lp284
VThat's a very far-fetched idea, but I really believe that it may be possible.
p285
aVThese cells are so versatile, these cancer cells are so versatile \u2014
p286
aVwe just have to manipulate them in the right way.
p287
aVAnd again, some of these may be far-fetched, but
p288
aVI figured if there's anywhere to present far-fetched ideas, it's here at TED, so
p289
aVthank you very much.
