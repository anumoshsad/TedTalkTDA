VSo today, I would like to talk with you
p4
aVabout bionics,
p5
aVwhich is the popular term
p6
aVfor the science of replacing part of a living organism
p7
aVwith a mechatronic device, or a robot.
p8
aVIt is essentially
p9
aVthe stuff of life meets machine.
p10
aVAnd specifically, I'd like to talk with you
p11
aVabout how bionics is evolving
p12
aVfor people with arm amputations.
p13
aa(lp14
VThis is our motivation.
p15
aVArm amputation causes a huge disability.
p16
aVI mean, the functional impairment is clear.
p17
aVOur hands are amazing instruments.
p18
aVAnd when you lose one, far less both,
p19
aVit's a lot harder to do the things
p20
aVwe physically need to do.
p21
aVThere's also a huge emotional impact.
p22
aVAnd actually, I spend as much of my time in clinic
p23
aVdealing with the emotional adjustment of patients
p24
aVas with the physical disability.
p25
aVAnd finally, there's a profound social impact.
p26
aVWe talk with our hands.
p27
aVWe greet with our hands.
p28
aVAnd we interact with the physical world with our hands.
p29
aVAnd when they're missing,
p30
aVit's a barrier.
p31
aVArm amputation is usually caused by trauma,
p32
aVwith things like industrial accidents,
p33
aVmotor vehicle collisions
p34
aVor, very poignantly, war.
p35
aVThere are also some children who are born without arms,
p36
aVcalled congenital limb deficiency.
p37
aa(lp38
VUnfortunately, we don't do great
p39
aVwith upper-limb prosthetics.
p40
aVThere are two general types.
p41
aVThey're called body-powered prostheses,
p42
aVwhich were invented just after the Civil War,
p43
aVrefined in World War I and World War II.
p44
aVHere you see a patent
p45
aVfor an arm in 1912.
p46
aVIt's not a lot different
p47
aVthan the one you see on my patient.
p48
aVThey work by harnessing shoulder power.
p49
aVSo when you squish your shoulders, they pull on a bicycle cable.
p50
aVAnd that bicycle cable can open or close a hand or a hook
p51
aVor bend an elbow.
p52
aVAnd we still use them commonly,
p53
aVbecause they're very robust
p54
aVand relatively simple devices.
p55
aa(lp56
VThe state of the art
p57
aVis what we call myoelectric prostheses.
p58
aVThese are motorized devices
p59
aVthat are controlled
p60
aVby little electrical signals from your muscle.
p61
aVEvery time you contract a muscle,
p62
aVit emits a little electricity
p63
aVthat you can record with antennae or electrodes
p64
aVand use that to operate the motorized prosthesis.
p65
aVThey work pretty well
p66
aVfor people who have just lost their hand,
p67
aVbecause your hand muscles are still there.
p68
aVYou squeeze your hand, these muscles contract.
p69
aVYou open it, these muscles contract.
p70
aVSo it's intuitive, and it works pretty well.
p71
aa(lp72
VWell how about with higher levels of amputation?
p73
aVNow you've lost your arm above the elbow.
p74
aVYou're missing not only these muscles,
p75
aVbut your hand and your elbow too.
p76
aVWhat do you do?
p77
aVWell our patients have to use
p78
aVvery code-y systems
p79
aVof using just their arm muscles
p80
aVto operate robotic limbs.
p81
aVWe have robotic limbs.
p82
aVThere are several available on the market, and here you see a few.
p83
aVThey contain just a hand that will open and close,
p84
aVa wrist rotator and an elbow.
p85
aVThere's no other functions.
p86
aVIf they did, how would we tell them what to do?
p87
aa(lp88
VWe built our own arm at the Rehab Institute of Chicago
p89
aVwhere we've added some wrist flexion and shoulder joints
p90
aVto get up to six motors, or six degrees of freedom.
p91
aVAnd we've had the opportunity to work with some very advanced arms
p92
aVthat were funded by the U.S. military, using these prototypes,
p93
aVthat had up to 10 different degrees of freedom
p94
aVincluding movable hands.
p95
aVBut at the end of the day,
p96
aVhow do we tell these robotic arms what to do?
p97
aVHow do we control them?
p98
aVWell we need a neural interface,
p99
aVa way to connect to our nervous system
p100
aVor our thought processes
p101
aVso that it's intuitive, it's natural,
p102
aVlike for you and I.
p103
aa(lp104
VWell the body works by starting a motor command in your brain,
p105
aVgoing down your spinal cord,
p106
aVout the nerves and to your periphery.
p107
aVAnd your sensation's the exact opposite.
p108
aVYou touch yourself, there's a stimulus
p109
aVthat comes up those very same nerves back up to your brain.
p110
aVWhen you lose your arm, that nervous system still works.
p111
aVThose nerves can put out command signals.
p112
aVAnd if I tap the nerve ending
p113
aVon a World War II vet,
p114
aVhe'll still feel his missing hand.
p115
aVSo you might say,
p116
aVlet's go to the brain
p117
aVand put something in the brain to record signals,
p118
aVor in the end of the peripheral nerve and record them there.
p119
aVAnd these are very exciting research areas,
p120
aVbut it's really, really hard.
p121
aVYou have to put in
p122
aVhundreds of microscopic wires
p123
aVto record from little tiny individual neurons \u2014 ordinary fibers
p124
aVthat put out tiny signals
p125
aVthat are microvolts.
p126
aVAnd it's just too hard
p127
aVto use now and for my patients today.
p128
aa(lp129
VSo we developed a different approach.
p130
aVWe're using a biological amplifier
p131
aVto amplify these nerve signals \u2014 muscles.
p132
aVMuscles will amplify the nerve signals
p133
aVabout a thousand-fold,
p134
aVso that we can record them from on top of the skin,
p135
aVlike you saw earlier.
p136
aVSo our approach is something we call targeted reinnervation.
p137
aVImagine, with somebody who's lost their whole arm,
p138
aVwe still have four major nerves
p139
aVthat go down your arm.
p140
aVAnd we take the nerve away from your chest muscle
p141
aVand let these nerves grow into it.
p142
aVNow you think, "Close hand," and a little section of your chest contracts.
p143
aVYou think, "Bend elbow,"
p144
aVa different section contracts.
p145
aVAnd we can use electrodes or antennae
p146
aVto pick that up and tell the arm to move.
p147
aVThat's the idea.
p148
aa(lp149
VSo this is the first man that we tried it on.
p150
aVHis name is Jesse Sullivan.
p151
aVHe's just a saint of a man \u2014
p152
aV54-year-old lineman who touched the wrong wire
p153
aVand had both of his arms burnt so badly
p154
aVthey had to be amputated at the shoulder.
p155
aVJesse came to us at the RIC
p156
aVto be fit with these state-of-the-art devices, and here you see them.
p157
aVI'm still using that old technology
p158
aVwith a bicycle cable on his right side.
p159
aVAnd he picks which joint he wants to move with those chin switches.
p160
aVOn the left side he's got a modern motorized prosthesis
p161
aVwith those three joints,
p162
aVand he operates little pads in his shoulder
p163
aVthat he touches to make the arm go.
p164
aVAnd Jesse's a good crane operator,
p165
aVand he did okay by our standards.
p166
aa(lp167
VHe also required a revision surgery on his chest.
p168
aVAnd that gave us the opportunity
p169
aVto do targeted reinnervation.
p170
aVSo my colleague, Dr. Greg Dumanian, did the surgery.
p171
aVFirst, we cut away the nerve to his own muscle,
p172
aVthen we took the arm nerves
p173
aVand just kind of had them shift down onto his chest
p174
aVand closed him up.
p175
aVAnd after about three months,
p176
aVthe nerves grew in a little bit and we could get a twitch.
p177
aVAnd after six months, the nerves grew in well,
p178
aVand you could see strong contractions.
p179
aVAnd this is what it looks like.
p180
aVThis is what happens when Jesse thinks
p181
aVopen and close his hand,
p182
aVor bend or straighten your elbow.
p183
aVYou can see the movements on his chest,
p184
aVand those little hash marks
p185
aVare where we put our antennae, or electrodes.
p186
aVAnd I challenge anybody in the room
p187
aVto make their chest go like this.
p188
aVHis brain is thinking about his arm.
p189
aVHe has not learned how to do this with the chest.
p190
aVThere is not a learning process.
p191
aVThat's why it's intuitive.
p192
aa(lp193
VSo here's Jesse in our first little test with him.
p194
aVOn the left-hand side, you see his original prosthesis,
p195
aVand he's using those switches
p196
aVto move little blocks from one box to the other.
p197
aVHe's had that arm for about 20 months, so he's pretty good with it.
p198
aVOn the right side,
p199
aVtwo months after we fit him with his targeted reinnervation prosthesis \u2014
p200
aVwhich, by the way, is the same physical arm,
p201
aVjust programmed a little different \u2014
p202
aVyou can see that he's much faster
p203
aVand much smoother as he moves these little blocks.
p204
aVAnd we're only able to use three of the signals at this time.
p205
aa(lp206
VThen we had one of those little surprises in science.
p207
aVSo we're all motivated to get motor commands
p208
aVto drive robotic arms.
p209
aVAnd after a few months,
p210
aVyou touch Jesse on his chest,
p211
aVand he felt his missing hand.
p212
aVHis hand sensation grew into his chest again
p213
aVprobably because we had also taken away a lot of fat,
p214
aVso the skin was right down to the muscle
p215
aVand deinnervated, if you would, his skin.
p216
aVSo you touch Jesse here, he feels his thumb;
p217
aVyou touch it here, he feels his pinky.
p218
aVHe feels light touch
p219
aVdown to one gram of force.
p220
aVHe feels hot, cold, sharp, dull,
p221
aVall in his missing hand,
p222
aVor both his hand and his chest,
p223
aVbut he can attend to either.
p224
aVSo this is really exciting for us,
p225
aVbecause now we have a portal,
p226
aVa portal, or a way to potentially give back sensation,
p227
aVso that he might feel what he touches
p228
aVwith his prosthetic hand.
p229
aVImagine sensors in the hand
p230
aVcoming up and pressing on this new hand skin.
p231
aVSo it was very exciting.
p232
aa(lp233
VWe've also gone on
p234
aVwith what was initially our primary population
p235
aVof people with above-the-elbow amputations.
p236
aVAnd here we deinnervate, or cut the nerve away,
p237
aVjust from little segments of muscle
p238
aVand leave others alone
p239
aVthat give us our up-down signals
p240
aVand two others that will give us a hand open and close signal.
p241
aVThis was one of our first patients, Chris.
p242
aVYou see him with his original device
p243
aVon the left there after eight months of use,
p244
aVand on the right, it is two months.
p245
aVHe's about four or five times as fast
p246
aVwith this simple little performance metric.
p247
aa(lp248
VAll right.
p249
aVSo one of the best parts of my job
p250
aVis working with really great patients
p251
aVwho are also our research collaborators.
p252
aVAnd we're fortunate today
p253
aVto have Amanda Kitts come and join us.
p254
aVPlease welcome Amanda Kitts.
p255
aa(lp256
V(Applause)
p257
aa(lp258
VSo Amanda, would you please tell us how you lost your arm?
p259
aa(lp260
VAmanda Kitts: Sure. In 2006, I had a car accident.
p261
aVAnd I was driving home from work,
p262
aVand a truck was coming the opposite direction,
p263
aVcame over into my lane,
p264
aVran over the top of my car and his axle tore my arm off.
p265
aa(lp266
VTodd Kuiken: Okay, so after your amputation, you healed up.
p267
aVAnd you've got one of these conventional arms.
p268
aVCan you tell us how it worked?
p269
aa(lp270
VAK: Well, it was a little difficult,
p271
aVbecause all I had to work with was a bicep and a tricep.
p272
aVSo for the simple little things like picking something up,
p273
aVI would have to bend my elbow,
p274
aVand then I would have to cocontract
p275
aVto get it to change modes.
p276
aVWhen I did that,
p277
aVI had to use my bicep
p278
aVto get the hand to close,
p279
aVuse my tricep to get it to open,
p280
aVcocontract again
p281
aVto get the elbow to work again.
p282
aa(lp283
VTK: So it was a little slow?
p284
aa(lp285
VAK: A little slow, and it was just hard to work.
p286
aVYou had to concentrate a whole lot.
p287
aa(lp288
VTK: Okay, so I think about nine months later
p289
aVthat you had the targeted reinnervation surgery,
p290
aVtook six more months to have all the reinnervation.
p291
aVThen we fit her with a prosthesis.
p292
aVAnd how did that work for you?
p293
aa(lp294
VAK: It works good.
p295
aVI was able to use my elbow
p296
aVand my hand simultaneously.
p297
aVI could work them just by my thoughts.
p298
aVSo I didn't have to do any of the cocontracting and all that.
p299
aa(lp300
VTK: A little faster?
p301
aa(lp302
VAK: A little faster. And much more easy, much more natural.
p303
aa(lp304
VTK: Okay, this was my goal.
p305
aVFor 20 years, my goal was to let somebody
p306
aV[be] able to use their elbow and hand in an intuitive way
p307
aVand at the same time.
p308
aVAnd we now have over 50 patients around the world who have had this surgery,
p309
aVincluding over a dozen of our wounded warriors
p310
aVin the U.S. armed services.
p311
aVThe success rate of the nerve transfers is very high.
p312
aVIt's like 96 percent.
p313
aVBecause we're putting a big fat nerve onto a little piece of muscle.
p314
aVAnd it provides intuitive control.
p315
aVOur functional testing, those little tests,
p316
aVall show that they're a lot quicker and a lot easier.
p317
aVAnd the most important thing
p318
aVis our patients have appreciated it.
p319
aa(lp320
VSo that was all very exciting.
p321
aVBut we want to do better.
p322
aVThere's a lot of information in those nerve signals,
p323
aVand we wanted to get more.
p324
aVYou can move each finger. You can move your thumb, your wrist.
p325
aVCan we get more out of it?
p326
aVSo we did some experiments
p327
aVwhere we saturated our poor patients with zillions of electrodes
p328
aVand then had them try to do two dozen different tasks \u2014
p329
aVfrom wiggling a finger to moving a whole arm
p330
aVto reaching for something \u2014
p331
aVand recorded this data.
p332
aVAnd then we used some algorithms
p333
aVthat are a lot like speech recognition algorithms,
p334
aVcalled pattern recognition.
p335
aVSee.
p336
aa(lp337
V(Laughter)
p338
aa(lp339
VAnd here you can see, on Jesse's chest,
p340
aVwhen he just tried to do three different things,
p341
aVyou can see three different patterns.
p342
aVBut I can't put in an electrode
p343
aVand say, "Go there."
p344
aVSo we collaborated with our colleagues in University of New Brunswick,
p345
aVcame up with this algorithm control,
p346
aVwhich Amanda can now demonstrate.
p347
aa(lp348
VAK: So I have the elbow that goes up and down.
p349
aVI have the wrist rotation
p350
aVthat goes \u2014 and it can go all the way around.
p351
aVAnd I have the wrist flexion and extension.
p352
aVAnd I also have the hand closed and open.
p353
aa(lp354
VTK: Thank you, Amanda.
p355
aVNow this is a research arm,
p356
aVbut it's made out of commercial components from here down
p357
aVand a few that I've borrowed from around the world.
p358
aVIt's about seven pounds,
p359
aVwhich is probably about what my arm would weigh
p360
aVif I lost it right here.
p361
aVObviously, that's heavy for Amanda.
p362
aVAnd in fact, it feels even heavier,
p363
aVbecause it's not glued on the same.
p364
aVShe's carrying all the weight through harnesses.
p365
aa(lp366
VSo the exciting part isn't so much the mechatronics,
p367
aVbut the control.
p368
aVSo we've developed a small microcomputer
p369
aVthat is blinking somewhere behind her back
p370
aVand is operating this
p371
aVall by the way she trains it
p372
aVto use her individual muscle signals.
p373
aVSo Amanda, when you first started using this arm,
p374
aVhow long did it take to use it?
p375
aa(lp376
VAK: It took just about probably three to four hours
p377
aVto get it to train.
p378
aVI had to hook it up to a computer,
p379
aVso I couldn't just train it anywhere.
p380
aVSo if it stopped working, I just had to take it off.
p381
aVSo now it's able to train
p382
aVwith just this little piece on the back.
p383
aVI can wear it around.
p384
aVIf it stops working for some reason, I can retrain it.
p385
aVTakes about a minute.
p386
aa(lp387
VTK: So we're really excited,
p388
aVbecause now we're getting to a clinically practical device.
p389
aVAnd that's where our goal is \u2014
p390
aVto have something clinically pragmatic to wear.
p391
aVWe've also had Amanda able to use
p392
aVsome of our more advanced arms that I showed you earlier.
p393
aVHere's Amanda using an arm made by DEKA Research Corporation.
p394
aVAnd I believe Dean Kamen presented it at TED a few years ago.
p395
aVSo Amanda, you can see,
p396
aVhas really good control.
p397
aVIt's all the pattern recognition.
p398
aVAnd it now has a hand that can do different grasps.
p399
aVWhat we do is have the patient go all the way open
p400
aVand think, "What hand grasp pattern do I want?"
p401
aVIt goes into that mode,
p402
aVand then you can do up to five or six different hand grasps with this hand.
p403
aVAmanda, how many were you able to do with the DEKA arm?
p404
aa(lp405
VAK: I was able to get four.
p406
aVI had the key grip, I had a chuck grip,
p407
aVI had a power grasp
p408
aVand I had a fine pinch.
p409
aVBut my favorite one was just when the hand was open,
p410
aVbecause I work with kids,
p411
aVand so all the time you're clapping and singing,
p412
aVso I was able to do that again, which was really good.
p413
aa(lp414
VTK: That hand's not so good for clapping.
p415
aa(lp416
VAK: Can't clap with this one.
p417
aa(lp418
VTK: All right. So that's exciting
p419
aVon where we may go with the better mechatronics,
p420
aVif we make them good enough
p421
aVto put out on the market and use in a field trial.
p422
aVI want you to watch closely.
p423
aa(lp424
V(Video) Claudia: Oooooh!
p425
aa(lp426
VTK: That's Claudia,
p427
aVand that was the first time
p428
aVshe got to feel sensation through her prosthetic.
p429
aVShe had a little sensor at the end of her prosthesis
p430
aVthat then she rubbed over different surfaces,
p431
aVand she could feel different textures
p432
aVof sandpaper, different grits, ribbon cable,
p433
aVas it pushed on her reinnervated hand skin.
p434
aVShe said that when she just ran it across the table,
p435
aVit felt like her finger was rocking.
p436
aVSo that's an exciting laboratory experiment
p437
aVon how to give back, potentially, some skin sensation.
p438
aa(lp439
VBut here's another video that shows some of our challenges.
p440
aVThis is Jesse, and he's squeezing a foam toy.
p441
aVAnd the harder he squeezes \u2014 you see a little black thing in the middle
p442
aVthat's pushing on his skin proportional to how hard he squeezes.
p443
aVBut look at all the electrodes around it.
p444
aVI've got a real estate problem.
p445
aVYou're supposed to put a bunch of these things on there,
p446
aVbut our little motor's making all kinds of noise
p447
aVright next to my electrodes.
p448
aVSo we're really challenged on what we're doing there.
p449
aa(lp450
VThe future is bright.
p451
aVWe're excited about where we are and a lot of things we want to do.
p452
aVSo for example,
p453
aVone is to get rid of my real estate problem
p454
aVand get better signals.
p455
aVWe want to develop these little tiny capsules
p456
aVabout the size of a piece of risotto
p457
aVthat we can put into the muscles
p458
aVand telemeter out the EMG signals,
p459
aVso that it's not worrying about electrode contact.
p460
aVAnd we can have the real estate open
p461
aVto try more sensation feedback.
p462
aVWe want to build a better arm.
p463
aVThis arm \u2014 they're always made for the 50th percentile male \u2014
p464
aVwhich means they're too big for five-eighths of the world.
p465
aVSo rather than a super strong or super fast arm,

aVthat will have a hand that wraps around,

p491
aVAnd thankfully Dr. Annie Simon was with us
p492
