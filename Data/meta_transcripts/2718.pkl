VI'm going to be talking about statistics today.
p4
aVIf that makes you immediately feel a little bit wary, that's OK,
p5
aVthat doesn't make you some kind of crazy conspiracy theorist,
p6
aVit makes you skeptical.
p7
aVAnd when it comes to numbers, especially now, you should be skeptical.
p8
aVBut you should also be able to tell which numbers are reliable
p9
aVand which ones aren't.
p10
aVSo today I want to try to give you some tools to be able to do that.
p11
aVBut before I do,
p12
aVI just want to clarify which numbers I'm talking about here.
p13
aVI'm not talking about claims like,
p14
aV"9 out of 10 women recommend this anti-aging cream."
p15
aVI think a lot of us always roll our eyes at numbers like that.
p16
aVWhat's different now is people are questioning statistics like,
p17
aV"The US unemployment rate is five percent."
p18
aVWhat makes this claim different is it doesn't come from a private company,
p19
aVit comes from the government.
p20
aa(lp21
VAbout 4 out of 10 Americans distrust the economic data
p22
aVthat gets reported by government.
p23
aVAmong supporters of President Trump it's even higher;
p24
aVit's about 7 out of 10.
p25
aVI don't need to tell anyone here
p26
aVthat there are a lot of dividing lines in our society right now,
p27
aVand a lot of them start to make sense,
p28
aVonce you understand people's relationships with these government numbers.
p29
aVOn the one hand, there are those who say these statistics are crucial,
p30
aVthat we need them to make sense of society as a whole
p31
aVin order to move beyond emotional anecdotes
p32
aVand measure progress in an [objective] way.
p33
aVAnd then there are the others,
p34
aVwho say that these statistics are elitist,
p35
aVmaybe even rigged;
p36
aVthey don't make sense and they don't really reflect
p37
aVwhat's happening in people's everyday lives.
p38
aa(lp39
VIt kind of feels like that second group is winning the argument right now.
p40
aVWe're living in a world of alternative facts,
p41
aVwhere people don't find statistics this kind of common ground,
p42
aVthis starting point for debate.
p43
aVThis is a problem.
p44
aVThere are actually moves in the US right now
p45
aVto get rid of some government statistics altogether.
p46
aVRight now there's a bill in congress about measuring racial inequality.
p47
aVThe draft law says that government money should not be used
p48
aVto collect data on racial segregation.
p49
aVThis is a total disaster.
p50
aVIf we don't have this data,
p51
aVhow can we observe discrimination,
p52
aVlet alone fix it?
p53
aVIn other words:
p54
aVHow can a government create fair policies
p55
aVif they can't measure current levels of unfairness?
p56
aVThis isn't just about discrimination,
p57
aVit's everything \u2014 think about it.
p58
aVHow can we legislate on health care
p59
aVif we don't have good data on health or poverty?
p60
aVHow can we have public debate about immigration
p61
aVif we can't at least agree
p62
aVon how many people are entering and leaving the country?
p63
aVStatistics come from the state; that's where they got their name.
p64
aVThe point was to better measure the population
p65
aVin order to better serve it.
p66
aVSo we need these government numbers,
p67
aVbut we also have to move beyond either blindly accepting
p68
aVor blindly rejecting them.
p69
aVWe need to learn the skills to be able to spot bad statistics.
p70
aa(lp71
VI started to learn some of these
p72
aVwhen I was working in a statistical department
p73
aVthat's part of the United Nations.
p74
aVOur job was to find out how many Iraqis had been forced from their homes
p75
aVas a result of the war,
p76
aVand what they needed.
p77
aVIt was really important work, but it was also incredibly difficult.
p78
aVEvery single day, we were making decisions
p79
aVthat affected the accuracy of our numbers \u2014
p80
aVdecisions like which parts of the country we should go to,
p81
aVwho we should speak to,
p82
aVwhich questions we should ask.
p83
aVAnd I started to feel really disillusioned with our work,
p84
aVbecause we thought we were doing a really good job,
p85
aVbut the one group of people who could really tell us were the Iraqis,
p86
aVand they rarely got the chance to find our analysis, let alone question it.
p87
aVSo I started to feel really determined
p88
aVthat the one way to make numbers more accurate
p89
aVis to have as many people as possible be able to question them.
p90
aa(lp91
VSo I became a data journalist.
p92
aVMy job is finding these data sets and sharing them with the public.
p93
aVAnyone can do this, you don't have to be a geek or a nerd.
p94
aVYou can ignore those words; they're used by people
p95
aVtrying to say they're smart while pretending they're humble.
p96
aVAbsolutely anyone can do this.
p97
aa(lp98
VI want to give you guys three questions
p99
aVthat will help you be able to spot some bad statistics.
p100
aVSo, question number one is: Can you see uncertainty?
p101
aVOne of things that's really changed people's relationship with numbers,
p102
aVand even their trust in the media,
p103
aVhas been the use of political polls.
p104
aVI personally have a lot of issues with political polls
p105
aVbecause I think the role of journalists is actually to report the facts
p106
aVand not attempt to predict them,
p107
aVespecially when those predictions can actually damage democracy
p108
aVby signaling to people: don't bother to vote for that guy,
p109
aVhe doesn't have a chance.
p110
aVLet's set that aside for now and talk about the accuracy of this endeavor.
p111
aa(lp112
VBased on national elections in the UK, Italy, Israel
p113
aVand of course, the most recent US presidential election,
p114
aVusing polls to predict electoral outcomes
p115
aVis about as accurate as using the moon to predict hospital admissions.
p116
aVNo, seriously, I used actual data from an academic study to draw this.
p117
aVThere are a lot of reasons why polling has become so inaccurate.
p118
aVOur societies have become really diverse,
p119
aVwhich makes it difficult for pollsters to get a really nice representative sample
p120
aVof the population for their polls.
p121
aVPeople are really reluctant to answer their phones to pollsters,
p122
aVand also, shockingly enough, people might lie.
p123
aVBut you wouldn't necessarily know that to look at the media.
p124
aVFor one thing, the probability of a Hillary Clinton win
p125
aVwas communicated with decimal places.
p126
aVWe don't use decimal places to describe the temperature.
p127
aVHow on earth can predicting the behavior of 230 million voters in this country
p128
aVbe that precise?
p129
aVAnd then there were those sleek charts.
p130
aVSee, a lot of data visualizations will overstate certainty, and it works \u2014
p131
aVthese charts can numb our brains to criticism.
p132
aVWhen you hear a statistic, you might feel skeptical.
p133
aVAs soon as it's buried in a chart,
p134
aVit feels like some kind of objective science,
p135
aVand it's not.
p136
aa(lp137
VSo I was trying to find ways to better communicate this to people,
p138
aVto show people the uncertainty in our numbers.
p139
aVWhat I did was I started taking real data sets,
p140
aVand turning them into hand-drawn visualizations,
p141
aVso that people can see how imprecise the data is;
p142
aVso people can see that a human did this,
p143
aVa human found the data and visualized it.
p144
aVFor example, instead of finding out the probability
p145
aVof getting the flu in any given month,
p146
aVyou can see the rough distribution of flu season.
p147
aVThis is \u2014
p148
aa(lp149
V(Laughter)
p150
aa(lp151
Va bad shot to show in February.
p152
aVBut it's also more responsible data visualization,
p153
aVbecause if you were to show the exact probabilities,
p154
aVmaybe that would encourage people to get their flu jabs
p155
aVat the wrong time.
p156
aa(lp157
VThe point of these shaky lines
p158
aVis so that people remember these imprecisions,
p159
aVbut also so they don't necessarily walk away with a specific number,
p160
aVbut they can remember important facts.
p161
aVFacts like injustice and inequality leave a huge mark on our lives.
p162
aVFacts like Black Americans and Native Americans have shorter life expectancies
p163
aVthan those of other races,
p164
aVand that isn't changing anytime soon.
p165
aVFacts like prisoners in the US can be kept in solitary confinement cells
p166
aVthat are smaller than the size of an average parking space.
p167
aa(lp168
VThe point of these visualizations is also to remind people
p169
aVof some really important statistical concepts,
p170
aVconcepts like averages.
p171
aVSo let's say you hear a claim like,
p172
aV"The average swimming pool in the US contains 6.23 fecal accidents."
p173
aVThat doesn't mean every single swimming pool in the country
p174
aVcontains exactly 6.23 turds.
p175
aVSo in order to show that,
p176
aVI went back to the original data, which comes from the CDC,
p177
aVwho surveyed 47 swimming facilities.
p178
aVAnd I just spent one evening redistributing poop.
p179
aVSo you can kind of see how misleading averages can be.
p180
aa(lp181
V(Laughter)
p182
aa(lp183
VOK, so the second question that you guys should be asking yourselves
p184
aVto spot bad numbers is:
p185
aVCan I see myself in the data?
p186
aVThis question is also about averages in a way,
p187
aVbecause part of the reason why people are so frustrated
p188
aVwith these national statistics,
p189
aVis they don't really tell the story of who's winning and who's losing
p190
aVfrom national policy.
p191
aVIt's easy to understand why people are frustrated with global averages
p192
aVwhen they don't match up with their personal experiences.
p193
aVI wanted to show people the way data relates to their everyday lives.
p194
aVI started this advice column called "Dear Mona,"
p195
aVwhere people would write to me with questions and concerns
p196
aVand I'd try to answer them with data.
p197
aVPeople asked me anything.
p198
aVquestions like, "Is it normal to sleep in a separate bed to my wife?"
p199
aV"Do people regret their tattoos?"
p200
aV"What does it mean to die of natural causes?"
p201
aa(lp202
VAll of these questions are great, because they make you think
p203
aVabout ways to find and communicate these numbers.
p204
aVIf someone asks you, "How much pee is a lot of pee?"
p205
aVwhich is a question that I got asked,
p206
aVyou really want to make sure that the visualization makes sense
p207
aVto as many people as possible.
p208
aVThese numbers aren't unavailable.
p209
aVSometimes they're just buried in the appendix of an academic study.
p210
aVAnd they're certainly not inscrutable;
p211
aVif you really wanted to test these numbers on urination volume,
p212
aVyou could grab a bottle and try it for yourself.
p213
aa(lp214
V(Laughter)
p215
aa(lp216
VThe point of this isn't necessarily
p217
aVthat every single data set has to relate specifically to you.
p218
aVI'm interested in how many women were issued fines in France
p219
aVfor wearing the face veil, or the niqab,
p220
aVeven if I don't live in France or wear the face veil.
p221
aVThe point of asking where you fit in is to get as much context as possible.
p222
aVSo it's about zooming out from one data point,
p223
aVlike the unemployment rate is five percent,
p224
aVand seeing how it changes over time,
p225
aVor seeing how it changes by educational status \u2014
p226
aVthis is why your parents always wanted you to go to college \u2014
p227
aVor seeing how it varies by gender.
p228
aVNowadays, male unemployment rate is higher
p229
aVthan the female unemployment rate.
p230
aVUp until the early '80s, it was the other way around.
p231
aVThis is a story of one of the biggest changes
p232
aVthat's happened in American society,
p233
aVand it's all there in that chart, once you look beyond the averages.
p234
aVThe axes are everything;
p235
aVonce you change the scale, you can change the story.
p236
aa(lp237
VOK, so the third and final question that I want you guys to think about
p238
aVwhen you're looking at statistics is:
p239
aVHow was the data collected?
p240
aVSo far, I've only talked about the way data is communicated,
p241
aVbut the way it's collected matters just as much.
p242
aVI know this is tough,
p243
aVbecause methodologies can be opaque and actually kind of boring,
p244
aVbut there are some simple steps you can take to check this.
p245
aa(lp246
VI'll use one last example here.
p247
aVOne poll found that 41 percent of Muslims in this country support jihad,
p248
aVwhich is obviously pretty scary,
p249
aVand it was reported everywhere in 2015.
p250
aVWhen I want to check a number like that,
p251
aVI'll start off by finding the original questionnaire.
p252
aVIt turns out that journalists who reported on that statistic
p253
aVignored a question lower down on the survey
p254
aVthat asked respondents how they defined "jihad."
p255
aVAnd most of them defined it as,
p256
aV"Muslims' personal, peaceful struggle to be more religious."
p257
aVOnly 16 percent defined it as, "violent holy war against unbelievers."
p258
aVThis is the really important point:
p259
aVbased on those numbers, it's totally possible
p260
aVthat no one in the survey who defined it as violent holy war
p261
aValso said they support it.
p262
aVThose two groups might not overlap at all.
p263
aa(lp264
VIt's also worth asking how the survey was carried out.
p265
aVThis was something called an opt-in poll,
p266
aVwhich means anyone could have found it on the internet and completed it.
p267
aVThere's no way of knowing if those people even identified as Muslim.
p268
aVAnd finally, there were 600 respondents in that poll.
p269
aVThere are roughly three million Muslims in this country,
p270
aVaccording to Pew Research Center.
p271
aVThat means the poll spoke to roughly one in every 5,000 Muslims
p272
aVin this country.
p273
aa(lp274
VThis is one of the reasons
p275
aVwhy government statistics are often better than private statistics.
p276
aVA poll might speak to a couple hundred people, maybe a thousand,
p277
aVor if you're L'Oreal, trying to sell skin care products in 2005,
p278
aVthen you spoke to 48 women to claim that they work.
p279
aa(lp280
V(Laughter)
p281
aa(lp282
VPrivate companies don't have a huge interest in getting the numbers right,
p283
aVthey just need the right numbers.
p284
aVGovernment statisticians aren't like that.
p285
aVIn theory, at least, they're totally impartial,
p286
aVnot least because most of them do their jobs regardless of who's in power.
p287
aVThey're civil servants.
p288
aVAnd to do their jobs properly,
p289
aVthey don't just speak to a couple hundred people.
p290
aVThose unemployment numbers I keep on referencing
p291
aVcome from the Bureau of Labor Statistics,
p292
aVand to make their estimates,
p293
aVthey speak to over 140,000 businesses in this country.
p294
aa(lp295
VI get it, it's frustrating.
p296
aVIf you want to test a statistic that comes from a private company,
p297
aVyou can buy the face cream for you and a bunch of friends, test it out,
p298
aVif it doesn't work, you can say the numbers were wrong.
p299
aVBut how do you question government statistics?
p300
aVYou just keep checking everything.
p301
aVFind out how they collected the numbers.
p302
aVFind out if you're seeing everything on the chart you need to see.
p303
aVBut don't give up on the numbers altogether, because if you do,
p304
aVwe'll be making public policy decisions in the dark,
p305
aVusing nothing but private interests to guide us.
p306
aa(lp307
VThank you.
