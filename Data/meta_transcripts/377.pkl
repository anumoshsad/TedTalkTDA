VThis session is on natural wonders,
p4
aVand the bigger conference is on the pursuit of happiness.
p5
aVI want to try to combine them all,
p6
aVbecause to me, healing is really the ultimate natural wonder.
p7
aVYour body has a remarkable capacity to begin healing itself,
p8
aVand much more quickly than people had once realized,
p9
aVif you simply stop doing what\u2019s causing the problem.
p10
aVAnd so, really, so much of what we do in medicine and life in general
p11
aVis focused on mopping up the floor without also turning off the faucet.
p12
aa(lp13
VI love doing this work, because it really gives many people
p14
aVnew hope and new choices that they didn\u2019t have before,
p15
aVand it allows us to talk about things that \u2014 not just diet,
p16
aVbut that happiness is not \u2014
p17
aVwe're talking about the pursuit of happiness,
p18
aVbut when you really look at all the spiritual traditions,
p19
aVwhat Aldous Huxley called the "perennial wisdom,"
p20
aVwhen you get past the named and forms and rituals that really divide people,
p21
aVit\u2019s really about \u2014 our nature is to be happy;
p22
aVour nature is to be peaceful, our nature is to be healthy.
p23
aVAnd so it\u2019s not something \u2014 happiness is not something you get,
p24
aVhealth is generally not something that you get.
p25
aVBut rather all of these different practices \u2014
p26
aVyou know, the ancient swamis and rabbis and priests and monks and nuns
p27
aVdidn\u2019t develop these techniques to just manage stress
p28
aVor lower your blood pressure, unclog your arteries,
p29
aVeven though it can do all those things.
p30
aVThey\u2019re powerful tools for transformation,
p31
aVfor quieting down our mind and bodies
p32
aVto allow us to experience what it feels like to be happy,
p33
aVto be peaceful, to be joyful
p34
aVand to realize that it\u2019s not something that you pursue and get,
p35
aVbut rather it\u2019s something that you have already until you disturb it.
p36
aa(lp37
VI studied yoga for many years with a teacher named Swami Satchidananda
p38
aVand people would say, "What are you, a Hindu?" He\u2019d say, "No, I\u2019m an undo."
p39
aVAnd it\u2019s really about identifying what\u2019s causing us
p40
aVto disturb our innate health and happiness,
p41
aVand then to allow that natural healing to occur.
p42
aVTo me, that\u2019s the real natural wonder.
p43
aa(lp44
VSo, within that larger context,
p45
aVwe can talk about diet, stress management \u2014
p46
aVwhich are really these spiritual practices \u2014
p47
aVmoderate exercise, smoking cessation, support groups and community \u2014
p48
aVwhich I\u2019ll talk more about \u2014 and some vitamins and supplements.
p49
aVAnd it\u2019s not a diet.
p50
aVYou know, when most people think about the diet I recommend,
p51
aVthey think it\u2019s a really strict diet.
p52
aVFor reversing disease, that\u2019s what it takes,
p53
aVbut if you\u2019re just trying to be healthy, you have a spectrum of choices.
p54
aVAnd to the degree that you can move in a healthy direction,
p55
aVyou\u2019re going to live longer, you\u2019re going to feel better,
p56
aVyou\u2019re going to lose weight, and so on.
p57
aVAnd in our studies, what we\u2019ve been able to do
p58
aVis to use very expensive, high-tech, state-of-the-art measures
p59
aVto prove how powerful these very simple and low-tech and low-cost \u2014
p60
aVand in many ways, ancient \u2014 interventions, can be.
p61
aa(lp62
VWe first began by looking at heart disease,
p63
aVand when I began doing this work 26 or 27 years ago,
p64
aVit was thought that once you have heart disease it can only get worse.
p65
aVAnd what we found was that, instead of getting worse and worse,
p66
aVin many cases it could get better and better,
p67
aVand much more quickly than people had once realized.
p68
aa(lp69
VThis is a representative patient who at the time was 73 \u2014
p70
aVtotally needed to have a bypass, decided to do this instead.
p71
aVWe used quantitative arteriography, showing the narrowing.
p72
aVThis is one of the arteries that feed the heart, one of the main arteries,
p73
aVand you can see the narrowing here.
p74
aVA year later, it\u2019s not as clogged; normally, it goes the other direction.
p75
aVThese minor changes in blockages
p76
aVcaused a 300 percent improvement in blood flow,
p77
aVand using cardiac positron emission tomography, or "PET," scans,
p78
aVblue and black is no blood flow, orange and white is maximal.
p79
aa(lp80
VHuge differences can occur without drugs, without surgery.
p81
aVClinically, he literally couldn\u2019t walk across the street without getting severe chest pain;
p82
aVwithin a month, like most people, was pain-free, and within a year,
p83
aVclimbing more than 100 floors a day on a Stairmaster.
p84
aVThis is not unusual, and it\u2019s part of what enables people
p85
aVto maintain these kinds of changes,
p86
aVbecause it makes such a big difference in their quality of life.
p87
aVOverall, if you looked at all the arteries in all the patients,
p88
aVthey got worse and worse, from one year to five years, in the comparison group.
p89
aVThis is the natural history of heart disease,
p90
aVbut it\u2019s really not natural because we found it could get better and better,
p91
aVand much more quickly than people had once thought.
p92
aVWe also found that the more people change, the better they got.
p93
aVIt wasn\u2019t a function of how old or how sick they were \u2014
p94
aVit was mainly how much they changed,
p95
aVand the oldest patients improved as much as the young ones.
p96
aa(lp97
VI got this as a Christmas card a few years ago
p98
aVfrom two of the patients in one of our programs.
p99
aVThe younger brother is 86, the older one\u2019s 95;
p100
aVthey wanted to show me how much more flexible they were.
p101
aVAnd the following year they sent me this one, which I thought was kind of funny.
p102
aV(Laughter)
p103
aVYou just never know.
p104
aVAnd what we found was that 99 percent of the patients
p105
aVstart to reverse the progression of their heart disease.
p106
aVNow I thought, you know, if we just did good science,
p107
aVthat would change medical practice. But, that was a little naive.
p108
aVIt\u2019s important, but not enough.
p109
aVBecause we doctors do what we get paid to do,
p110
aVand we get trained to do what we get paid to do,
p111
aVso if we change insurance, then we change medical practice and medical education.
p112
aVInsurance will cover the bypass, it\u2019ll cover the angioplasty;
p113
aVit won\u2019t, until recently, cover diet and lifestyle.
p114
aa(lp115
VSo, we began through our nonprofit institute's
p116
aVtraining hospitals around the country,
p117
aVand we found that most people could avoid surgery,
p118
aVand not only was it medically effective, it was also cost effective.
p119
aVAnd the insurance companies found
p120
aVthat they began to save almost 30,000 dollars per patient,
p121
aVand Medicare is now in the middle of doing a demonstration project
p122
aVwhere they\u2019re paying for 1,800 people to go through the program
p123
aVon the sites that we train.
p124
aVThe fortuneteller says, "I give smokers a discount
p125
aVbecause there\u2019s not as much to tell." (Laughter)
p126
aVI like this slide, because it\u2019s a chance to talk about
p127
aVwhat really motivates people to change, and what doesn\u2019t.
p128
aVAnd what doesn\u2019t work is fear of dying,
p129
aVand that\u2019s what\u2019s normally used.
p130
aa(lp131
VEverybody who smokes knows it\u2019s not good for you,
p132
aVand still 30 percent of Americans smoke \u2014
p133
aV80 percent in some parts of the world. Why do people do it?
p134
aVWell, because it helps them get through the day.
p135
aVAnd I\u2019ll talk more about this, but the real epidemic
p136
aVisn\u2019t just heart disease or obesity or smoking \u2014 it\u2019s loneliness and depression.
p137
aVAs one woman said, "I\u2019ve got 20 friends in this package of cigarettes,
p138
aVand they\u2019re always there for me and nobody else is.
p139
aVYou\u2019re going to take away my 20 friends? What are you going to give me?"
p140
aVOr they eat when they get depressed,
p141
aVor they use alcohol to numb the pain,
p142
aVor they work too hard, or watch too much TV.
p143
aVThere are lots of ways we have of avoiding and numbing and bypassing pain,
p144
aVbut the point of all of this is to deal with the cause of the problem.
p145
aVAnd the pain is not the problem: it\u2019s the symptom.
p146
aVAnd telling people they\u2019re going to die is too scary to think about,
p147
aVor, they\u2019re going to get emphysema or heart attack is too scary,
p148
aVand so they don\u2019t want to think about it, so they don\u2019t.
p149
aa(lp150
VThe most effective anti-smoking ad was this one.
p151
aVYou\u2019ll notice the limp cigarette hanging out of his mouth,
p152
aVand "impotence" \u2014 the headline is, "Impotent" \u2014 it\u2019s not emphysema.
p153
aVWhat was the biggest selling drug of all time
p154
aVwhen it was introduced a few years ago?
p155
aVViagra, right? Why? Because a lot of guys need it.
p156
aVIt\u2019s not like you say, "Hey Joe, I\u2019m having erectile dysfunction, how about you?"
p157
aVAnd yet, look at the number of prescriptions that are being sold.
p158
aVIt\u2019s not so much psychological, it\u2019s vascular,
p159
aVand nicotine makes your arteries constrict.
p160
aVSo does cocaine, so does a high fat diet, so does emotional stress.
p161
aa(lp162
VSo the very behaviors that we think of as being so sexy in our culture
p163
aVare the very ones that leave so many people feeling tired,
p164
aVlethargic, depressed and impotent, and that\u2019s not much fun.
p165
aVBut when you change those behaviors, your brain gets more blood,
p166
aVyou think more clearly, you have more energy,
p167
aVyour heart gets more blood in ways I\u2019ve shown you.
p168
aVYour sexual function improves.
p169
aVAnd these things occur within hours. This is a study: a high fat meal,
p170
aVand within one or two hours blood-flow is measurably less \u2014
p171
aVand you\u2019ve all experienced this at Thanksgiving.
p172
aVWhen you eat a big fatty meal, how do you feel?
p173
aVYou feel kind of sleepy afterwards.
p174
aVOn a low-fat meal, the blood flow doesn\u2019t go down \u2014 it even goes up.
p175
aVMany of you have kids, and you know that\u2019s a big change in your lifestyle,
p176
aVand so people are not afraid to make big changes in lifestyle if they\u2019re worth it.
p177
aVAnd the paradox is that when you make big changes, you get big benefits,
p178
aVand you feel so much better so quickly.
p179
aVFor many people, those are choices worth making \u2014
p180
aVnot to live longer, but to live better.
p181
aa(lp182
VI want to talk a little bit about the obesity epidemic,
p183
aVbecause it really is a problem.
p184
aVTwo-thirds of adults are overweight or obese,
p185
aVand diabetes in kids and 30-year-olds
p186
aVhas increased 70 percent in the last 10 years. It\u2019s no joke: it\u2019s real.
p187
aVAnd just to show you this, this is from the CDC.
p188
aVThese are not election returns; these are the percentage of people who are overweight.
p189
aVAnd if you see from '85 to '86 to '87, '88, '89, '90, '91 \u2014
p190
aVyou get a new category, 15 to 20 percent; '92, '93, '94, '95, '96, '97 \u2014
p191
aVyou get a new category; '98, '99, 2000, and 2001.
p192
aVMississippi, more than 25 percent of people are overweight.
p193
aVWhy is this? Well, this is one way to lose weight that works very well ...
p194
aVbut it doesn\u2019t last, which is the problem.
p195
aa(lp196
V(Laughter)
p197
aa(lp198
VNow, there\u2019s no mystery in how you lose weight;
p199
aVyou either burn more calories by exercise or you eat fewer calories.
p200
aVNow, one way to eat fewer calories is to eat less food,
p201
aVwhich is why you can lose weight on any diet if you eat less food,
p202
aVor if you restrict entire categories of foods.
p203
aVBut the problem is, you get hungry, so it\u2019s hard to keep it off.
p204
aVThe other way is to change the type of food.
p205
aVAnd fat has nine calories per gram,
p206
aVwhereas protein and carbs only have four.
p207
aVSo, when you eat less fat, you eat fewer calories without having to eat less food.
p208
aVSo you can eat the same amount of food, but you\u2019ll be getting fewer calories
p209
aVbecause the food is less dense in calories.
p210
aVAnd it\u2019s the volume of food that affects satiety, rather than the type of food.
p211
aa(lp212
VYou know, I don\u2019t like talking about the Atkins diet, but I get asked about it every day,
p213
aVand so I just thought I\u2019d spend a few minutes on that.
p214
aVThe myth that you hear about is,
p215
aVAmericans have been told to eat less fat,
p216
aVthe percent of calories from fat is down,
p217
aVAmericans are fatter than ever, therefore fat doesn\u2019t make you fat.
p218
aVIt\u2019s a half-truth. Actually, Americans are eating more fat than ever,
p219
aVand even more carbs. And so the percentage is lower,
p220
aVthe actual amount is higher, and so the goal is to reduce both.
p221
aVDr. Atkins and I debated each other many times before he died,
p222
aVand we agreed that Americans eat too many simple carbs,
p223
aVthe "bad carbs," and these are things like \u2014
p224
aV(Laughter)
p225
aV\u2014 sugar, white flour, white rice, alcohol. And you get a double whammy:
p226
aVyou get all these calories that don\u2019t fill you up because you\u2019ve removed the fiber,
p227
aVand they get absorbed quickly so your blood sugar zooms up.
p228
aVYour pancreas makes insulin to bring it back down, which is good.
p229
aVBut insulin accelerates the conversion of calories into fat.
p230
aVSo, the goal is not to go to pork rinds and bacon and sausages \u2014
p231
aVthese are not health foods \u2014
p232
aVbut to go from "bad carbs" to what are called "good carbs."
p233
aVAnd these are things like whole foods, or unrefined carbs:
p234
aVfruits, vegetables, whole wheat flour, brown rice, in their natural forms, are rich in fiber.
p235
aVAnd the fiber fills you up before you get too many calories,
p236
aVand it slows the absorption so you don\u2019t get that rapid rise in blood sugar.
p237
aVSo, and you get all the disease-protective substances.
p238
aa(lp239
VIt\u2019s not just what you exclude from your diet,
p240
aVbut also what you include that\u2019s protective.
p241
aVJust as all carbs are not bad for you, all fats are not bad for you. There are good fats.
p242
aVAnd these are predominantly what are called the Omega-3 fatty acids.
p243
aVYou find these, for example, in fish oil.
p244
aVAnd the bad fats are things like trans-fatty acids and processed food
p245
aVand saturated fats, which we find in meat.
p246
aVIf you don\u2019t remember anything else from this talk,
p247
aVthree grams a day of fish oil can reduce your risk of a heart attack
p248
aVand sudden death by 50 to 80 percent.
p249
aVThree grams a day. They come in one-gram capsules;
p250
aVmore than that just gives you extra fat you don\u2019t need.
p251
aVIt also helps reduce the risk of the most common cancers
p252
aVlike breast, prostate and colon cancer.
p253
aVNow, the problem with the Atkins diet,
p254
aVeverybody knows people who have lost weight on it,
p255
aVbut you can lose weight on amphetamines, you know, and fen-phen.
p256
aVI mean, there are lots of ways of losing weight that aren\u2019t good for you.
p257
aVYou want to lose weight in a way that enhances your health
p258
aVrather than the one that harms it.
p259
aVAnd the problem is that it\u2019s based on this half-truth,
p260
aVwhich is that Americans eat too many simple carbs,
p261
aVso if you eat fewer simple carbs you\u2019re going to lose weight.
p262
aVYou\u2019ll lose even more weight if you go to whole foods and less fat,
p263
aVand you\u2019ll enhance your health rather than harming it.
p264
aVHe says, "I\u2019ve got some good news.
p265
aVWhile your cholesterol level has remained the same,
p266
aVthe research findings have changed."
p267
aa(lp268
V(Laughter)
p269
aa(lp270
VNow, what happens to your heart when you go on an Atkins diet?
p271
aVThe red is good at the beginning, and a year later \u2014
p272
aVthis is from a study done in a peer-reviewed journal called Angiology \u2014
p273
aVthere\u2019s more red after a year on a diet like I would recommend,
p274
aVthere\u2019s less red, less blood flow after a year on an Atkins-type diet.
p275
aVSo, yes, you can lose weight, but your heart isn\u2019t happy.
p276
aVNow, one of the studies funded by the Atkins Center
p277
aVfound that 70 percent of the people were constipated, 65 percent had bad breath,
p278
aV54 percent had headaches \u2013 this is not a healthy way to eat.
p279
aVAnd so, you might start to lose weight and start to attract people towards you,
p280
aVbut when they get too close it\u2019s going to be a problem.
p281
aa(lp282
V(Laughter)
p283
aa(lp284
VAnd more seriously, there are case reports now of 16-year-old girls
p285
aVwho died after a few weeks on the Atkins diet \u2014
p286
aVof bone disease, kidney disease, and so on.
p287
aVAnd that\u2019s how your body excretes waste, is through your breath,
p288
aVyour bowels and your perspiration.
p289
aVSo when you go on these kinds of diet, they begin to smell bad.
p290
aVSo, an optimal diet is low in fat, low in the bad carbs,
p291
aVhigh in the good carbs and enough of the good fats.
p292
aVAnd then, again, it\u2019s a spectrum:
p293
aVwhen you move in this direction, you\u2019re going to lose weight,
p294
aVyou\u2019re going to feel better and you\u2019re going to gain health.
p295
aa(lp296
VNow, there are ecological reasons for eating lower on the food chain too,
p297
aVwhether it\u2019s the deforestation of the Amazon, or making more protein available,
p298
aVto the four billion people who live on a dollar a day \u2014
p299
aVnot to mention whatever ethical concerns people have.
p300
aVSo, there are lots of reasons for eating this way that go beyond just your health.
p301
aa(lp302
VNow, we\u2019re about to publish the first study
p303
aVlooking at the effects of this program on prostate cancer,
p304
aVand, in collaboration with Sloane-Kettering and with UCSF.
p305
aVWe took 90 men who had biopsy-proven prostate cancer
p306
aVand who had elected, for reasons unrelated to the study, not to have surgery.
p307
aVWe could randomly divide them into two groups,
p308
aVand then we could have one group
p309
aVthat is a non-intervention control group to compare to,
p310
aVwhich we can\u2019t do with, say, breast cancer, because everyone gets treated.
p311
aa(lp312
VWhat we found was that, after a year,
p313
aVnone of the experimental group patients
p314
aVwho made these lifestyle changes needed treatment,
p315
aVwhereas six of the control-group patients needed surgery or radiation.
p316
aVWhen we looked at their PSA levels \u2014 which is a marker for prostate cancer \u2014
p317
aVthey got worse in the control group,
p318
aVbut they actually got better in the experimental group,
p319
aVand these differences were highly significant.
p320
aa(lp321
VAnd then I wondered: was there any relationship
p322
aVbetween how much people changed their diet and lifestyle \u2014
p323
aVwhichever group they were in \u2014 and the changes in PSA?
p324
aVAnd sure enough, we found a dose-response relationship,
p325
aVjust like we found in the arterial blockages in our cardiac studies.
p326
aVAnd in order for the PSA to go down, they had to make pretty big changes.
p327
aa(lp328
VI then wondered, well, maybe they\u2019re just changing their PSA,
p329
aVbut it\u2019s not really affecting the tumor growth.
p330
aVSo we took some of their blood serum and sent it down to UCLA;
p331
aVthey added it to a standard line of prostate tumor cells growing in tissue culture,
p332
aVand it inhibited the growth seven times more
p333
aVin the experimental group than in the control group \u2014 70 versus 9 percent.
p334
aVAnd finally, I said, I wonder if there\u2019s any relationship between
p335
aVhow much people change and how it inhibited their tumor growth,
p336
aVwhichever group they happened to be in.
p337
aVAnd this really got me excited because again,
p338
aVwe found the same pattern: the more people change,
p339
aVthe more it affected the growth of their tumors.
p340
aVAnd finally, we did MRI and MR spectroscopy scans on some of these patients,
p341
aVand the tumor activity is shown in red in this patient,
p342
aVand you can see clearly it\u2019s better a year later, along with the PSA going down.
p343
aVSo, if it\u2019s true for prostate cancer, it\u2019ll almost certainly be true for breast cancer as well.
p344
aVAnd whether or not you have conventional treatment,
p345
aVin addition, if you make these changes, it may help reduce the risk of recurrence.
p346
aa(lp347
VThe last thing I want to talk about, apropos of the issue of the pursuit of happiness,
p348
aVis that study after study have shown
p349
aVthat people who are lonely and depressed \u2014
p350
aVand depression is the other real epidemic in our culture \u2014
p351
aVare many times more likely to get sick and die prematurely,
p352
aVin part because, as we talked about, they\u2019re more likely to smoke
p353
aVand overeat and drink too much and work too hard and so on.
p354
aVBut also, through mechanisms that we don\u2019t fully understand,
p355
aVpeople who are lonely and depressed are many times \u2014
p356
aVthree to five to ten times, in some studies \u2014
p357
aVmore likely to get sick and die prematurely.
p358
aVAnd depression is treatable. We need to do something about that.

VNow, on the other hand, anything that promotes intimacy is healing.
p361
aVIt can be sexual intimacy \u2013
p362
aVI happen to think that healing energy and erotic energy
p363
aVare just different forms of the same thing.
p364
aVFriendship, altruism, compassion, service \u2013 all the perennial truths that we talked about
p365
aVthat are part of all religion and all cultures \u2014
p366
aVonce you stop trying to see the differences,
p367
aVthese are the things in our own self-interest,
p368
aVbecause they free us from our suffering and from disease.
p369
aVAnd it\u2019s in a sense the most selfish thing that we can do.
p370
aa(lp371
VJust take a look at one study. This was done by David Spiegel at Stanford.
p372
aVHe took women with metastatic breast cancer,
p373
aVrandomly divided them into two groups.
p374
aVOne group of people just met for an hour-and-a-half once a week in a support group.
p375
aVIt was a nurturing, loving environment,
p376
aVwhere they were encouraged to let down their emotional defenses
p377
aVand talk about how awful it is to have breast cancer
p378
aVwith people who understood, because they were going through it too.
p379
aVThey just met once a week for a year.
p380
aVFive years later, those women lived twice as long, and you can see that the people \u2014
p381
aVand that was the only difference between the groups.
p382
aVIt was a randomized control study published in The Lancet.
p383
aVOther studies have shown this as well.
p384
aVSo, these simple things that create intimacy are really healing,
p385
aVand even the word healing, it comes from the root "to make whole."
p386
aVThe word yoga comes from the Sanskrit,
p387
aVmeaning "union, to yoke, to bring together."
p388
aa(lp389
VAnd the last slide I want to show you is from \u2014 I was \u2014 again,
p390
aVthis swami that I studied with for so many years, and I
p391
aVdid a combined oncology and cardiology Grand Rounds
p392
aVat the University of Virginia medical school a couple of years ago.
p393
aVAnd at the end of it, somebody said,
p394
aV"Hey, Swami, what\u2019s the difference between wellness and illness?"
p395
aVAnd so he went up on the board and he wrote the word "illness,"
p396
aVand circled the first letter, and then wrote the word "wellness,"
p397
aVand circled the first two letters ...
p398
aVTo me, it\u2019s just shorthand for what we\u2019re talking about:
p399
aVthat anything that creates a sense of connection
p400
aVand community and love is really healing.
p401
aVAnd then we can enjoy our lives more fully without getting sick in the process.
p402
aVThank you. (Applause)
