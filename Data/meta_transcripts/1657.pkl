VIt was a Saturday afternoon in May,
p4
aVand I suddenly realized
p5
aVthat the next day was Mother's Day,
p6
aVand I hadn't gotten anything for my mom,
p7
aVso I started thinking about
p8
aVwhat should I get my mom for Mother's Day?
p9
aVI thought, why don't I make her
p10
aVan interactive Mother's Day card
p11
aVusing the Scratch software that I'd been developing
p12
aVwith my research group at the MIT Media Lab?
p13
aVWe developed it so that people could easily create
p14
aVtheir own interactive stories and games and animations,
p15
aVand then share their creations with one another.
p16
aVSo I thought, this would be an opportunity to use Scratch
p17
aVto make an interactive card for my mom.
p18
aa(lp19
VBefore making my own Mother's Day card,
p20
aVI thought I would take a look
p21
aVat the Scratch website.
p22
aVSo over the last several years, kids around the world
p23
aVages 8 and up, have shared their projects,
p24
aVand I thought, I wonder if, of those three million projects,
p25
aVwhether anyone else has thought to put up Mother's Day cards.
p26
aVSo in the search box I typed in
p27
aV"Mother's Day,"
p28
aVand I was surprised and delighted to see a list
p29
aVof dozens and dozens of Mother's Day cards
p30
aVthat showed up on the Scratch website,
p31
aVmany of them just in the past 24 hours
p32
aVby procrastinators just like myself.
p33
aVSo I started taking a look at them. (Music)
p34
aVI saw one of them that featured a kitten
p35
aVand her mom and wishing her mom a happy Mother's Day.
p36
aVAnd the creator very considerately
p37
aVoffered a replay for her mom.
p38
aVAnother one was an interactive project where,
p39
aVwhen you moved the mouse over the letters of "Happy Mom Day,"
p40
aVit reveals a special happy Mother's Day slogan.
p41
aV(Music) In this one, the creator told a narrative
p42
aVabout how she had Googled to find out
p43
aVwhen Mother's Day was happening.
p44
aV(Typing) And then once she found out when Mother's Day was happening,
p45
aVshe delivered a special Mother's Day greeting
p46
aVof how much she loved her mom.
p47
aa(lp48
VSo I really enjoyed looking at these projects
p49
aVand interacting with these projects.
p50
aVIn fact, I liked it so much that, instead of making my own project,
p51
aVI sent my mom links to about a dozen of these projects. (Laughter)
p52
aVAnd actually, she reacted exactly the way that I hoped that she would.
p53
aVShe wrote back to me and she said,
p54
aV"I'm so proud to have a son that created the software
p55
aVthat allowed these kids to make Mother's Day cards for their mothers."
p56
aa(lp57
VSo my mom was happy, and that made me happy,
p58
aVbut actually I was even happier for another reason.
p59
aVI was happy because these kids were using Scratch
p60
aVjust in the way that we had hoped that they would.
p61
aVAs they created their interactive Mother's Day cards,
p62
aVyou could see that they were really
p63
aVbecoming fluent with new technologies.
p64
aVWhat do I mean by fluent?
p65
aVI mean that they were able to start expressing themselves
p66
aVand to start expressing their ideas.
p67
aVWhen you become fluent with language,
p68
aVit means you can write an entry in your journal
p69
aVor tell a joke to someone or write a letter to a friend.
p70
aVAnd it's similar with new technologies.
p71
aVBy writing, be creating these interactive Mother's Day cards,
p72
aVthese kids were showing that they were really fluent
p73
aVwith new technologies.
p74
aa(lp75
VNow maybe you won't be so surprised by this,
p76
aVbecause a lot of times people feel that
p77
aVyoung people today can do all sorts of things with technology.
p78
aVI mean, all of us have heard young people referred to as "digital natives."
p79
aVBut actually I'm sort of skeptical about this term.
p80
aVI'm not so sure we should be thinking of young people as digital natives.
p81
aVWhen you really look at it, how is it that young people
p82
aVspend most of their time using new technologies?
p83
aVYou often see them in situations like this,
p84
aVor like this,
p85
aVand there's no doubt that young people
p86
aVare very comfortable and familiar browsing
p87
aVand chatting and texting and gaming.
p88
aVBut that doesn't really make you fluent.
p89
aa(lp90
VSo young people today have lots of experience
p91
aVand lots of familiarity with interacting with new technologies,
p92
aVbut a lot less so of creating with new technologies
p93
aVand expressing themselves with new technologies.
p94
aVIt's almost as if they can read
p95
aVbut not write with new technologies.
p96
aa(lp97
VAnd I'm really interested in seeing, how can we help young people become fluent
p98
aVso they can write with new technologies?
p99
aVAnd that really means that they need to be able to
p100
aVwrite their own computer programs, or code.
p101
aa(lp102
VSo, increasingly, people are starting to recognize
p103
aVthe importance of learning to code.
p104
aVYou know, in recent years, there have been
p105
aVhundreds of new organizations and websites
p106
aVthat are helping young people learn to code.
p107
aVYou look online, you'll see places like Codecademy
p108
aVand events like CoderDojo
p109
aVand sites like Girls Who Code,
p110
aVor Black Girls Code.
p111
aVIt seems that everybody is getting into the act.
p112
aVYou know, just at the beginning of this year,
p113
aVat the turn of the new year,
p114
aVNew York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg
p115
aVmade a New Year's resolution that he was going to learn
p116
aVto code in 2012.
p117
aVA few months later, the country of Estonia decided that
p118
aVall of its first graders should learn to code.
p119
aVAnd that triggered a debate in the U.K.
p120
aVabout whether all the children there should learn to code.
p121
aa(lp122
VNow, for some of you, when you hear about this,
p123
aVit might seem sort of strange about everybody learning to code.
p124
aVWhen many people think of coding, they think of it
p125
aVas something that only a very narrow sub-community
p126
aVof people are going to be doing,
p127
aVand they think of coding looking like this.
p128
aVAnd in fact, if this is what coding is like,
p129
aVit will only be a narrow sub-community of people
p130
aVwith special mathematical skills and technological background
p131
aVthat can code.
p132
aa(lp133
VBut coding doesn't have to be like this.
p134
aVLet me show you about what it's like to code in Scratch.
p135
aVSo in Scratch, to code, you just snap blocks together.
p136
aVIn this case, you take a move block,
p137
aVsnap it into a stack,
p138
aVand the stacks of blocks control the behaviors
p139
aVof the different characters in your game or your story,
p140
aVin this case controlling the big fish.
p141
aVAfter you've created your program, you can click on "share,"
p142
aVand then share your project with other people,
p143
aVso that they can use the project
p144
aVand start working on the project as well.
p145
aa(lp146
VSo, of course, making a fish game isn't the only thing
p147
aVyou can do with Scratch.
p148
aVOf the millions of projects on the Scratch website,
p149
aVthere's everything from animated stories
p150
aVto school science projects
p151
aVto anime soap operas
p152
aVto virtual construction kits
p153
aVto recreations of classic video games
p154
aVto political opinion polls
p155
aVto trigonometry tutorials
p156
aVto interactive artwork, and, yes,
p157
aVinteractive Mother's Day cards.
p158
aa(lp159
VSo I think there's so many different ways
p160
aVthat people can express themselves using this,
p161
aVto be able to take their ideas and share their ideas with the world.
p162
aVAnd it doesn't just stay on the screen.
p163
aVYou can also code to interact with the physical world around you.
p164
aVHere's an example from Hong Kong,
p165
aVwhere some kids made a game
p166
aVand then built their own physical interface device
p167
aVand had a light sensor, so the light sensor
p168
aVdetects the hole in the board,
p169
aVso as they move the physical saw,
p170
aVthe light sensor detects the hole
p171
aVand controls the virtual saw on the screen
p172
aVand saws down the tree.
p173
aa(lp174
VWe're going to continue to look at new ways
p175
aVof bringing together the physical world and the virtual world
p176
aVand connecting to the world around us.
p177
aVThis is an example from a new version of Scratch
p178
aVthat we'll be releasing in the next few months,
p179
aVand we're looking again to be able
p180
aVto push you in new directions.
p181
aVHere's an example.
p182
aVIt uses the webcam.
p183
aVAnd as I move my hand, I can pop the balloons
p184
aVor I can move the bug.
p185
aVSo it's a little bit like Microsoft Kinect,
p186
aVwhere you interact with gestures in the world.
p187
aVBut instead of just playing someone else's game,
p188
aVyou get to create the games,
p189
aVand if you see someone else's game,
p190
aVyou can just say "see inside,"
p191
aVand you can look at the stacks of blocks that control it.
p192
aVSo there's a new block that says how much video motion there is,
p193
aVand then, if there's so much video motion,
p194
aVit will then tell the balloon to pop.
p195
aa(lp196
VThe same way that this uses the camera
p197
aVto get information into Scratch,
p198
aVyou can also use the microphone.
p199
aVHere's an example of a project using the microphone.
p200
aVSo I'm going to let all of you control this game
p201
aVusing your voices.
p202
aa(lp203
V(Crickets chirping) (Shouts) (Chomping)
p204
aV(Laughter)
p205
aV(Applause)
p206
aa(lp207
VAs kids are creating projects like this,
p208
aVthey're learning to code,
p209
aVbut even more importantly, they're coding to learn.
p210
aVBecause as they learn to code,
p211
aVit enables them to learn many other things,
p212
aVopens up many new opportunities for learning.
p213
aVAgain, it's useful to make an analogy to reading and writing.
p214
aVWhen you learn to read and write, it opens up
p215
aVopportunities for you to learn so many other things.
p216
aVWhen you learn to read, you can then read to learn.
p217
aVAnd it's the same thing with coding.
p218
aVIf you learn to code, you can code to learn.
p219
aVNow some of the things you can learn are sort of obvious.
p220
aVYou learn more about how computers work.
p221
aVBut that's just where it starts.
p222
aVWhen you learn to code, it opens up for you to learn
p223
aVmany other things.
p224
aa(lp225
VLet me show you an example.
p226
aVHere's another project,
p227
aVand I saw this when I was visiting
p228
aVone of the computer clubhouses.
p229
aVThese are after-school learning centers that we helped start
p230
aVthat help young people from low-income communities
p231
aVlearn to express themselves creatively with new technologies.
p232
aVAnd when I went to one of the clubhouses a couple years ago,
p233
aVI saw a 13-year-old boy who was using our Scratch software
p234
aVto create a game somewhat like this one,
p235
aVand he was very happy with his game and proud of his game,
p236
aVbut also he wanted to do more.
p237
aVHe wanted to keep score.
p238
aVSo this was a game where the big fish eats the little fish,
p239
aVbut he wanted to keep score, so that each time
p240
aVthe big fish eats the little fish,
p241
aVthe score would go up and it would keep track,
p242
aVand he didn't know how to do that.
p243
aVSo I showed him.
p244
aVIn Scratch, you can create something called a variable.
p245
aVI'll call it score.
p246
aVAnd that creates some new blocks for you,
p247
aVand also creates a little scoreboard that keeps track of the score,
p248
aVso each time I click on "change score," it increments the score.
p249
aVSo I showed this to the clubhouse member \u2014
p250
aVlet's call him Victor \u2014 and Victor,
p251
aVwhen he saw that this block would let him increment the score,
p252
aVhe knew exactly what to do.
p253
aVHe took the block
p254
aVand he put it into the program
p255
aVexactly where the big fish eats the little fish.
p256
aVSo then, each time the big fish eats the little fish,
p257
aVhe will increment the score, and the score will go up by one.
p258
aVAnd it's in fact working.
p259
aVAnd he saw this, and he was so excited,
p260
aVhe reached his hand out to me,
p261
aVand he said, "Thank you, thank you, thank you."
p262
aVAnd what went through my mind was,
p263
aVhow often is it that teachers are thanked by their students
p264
aVfor teaching them variables? (Laughter)
p265
aVIt doesn't happen in most classrooms,
p266
aVbut that's because in most classrooms, when kids learn about variables,
p267
aVthey don't know why they're learning it.
p268
aVIt's nothing that, really, they can make use of.
p269
aVWhen you learn ideas like this in Scratch,
p270
aVyou can learn it in a way that's really meaningful and motivating for you,
p271
aVthat you can understand the reason for learning variables,
p272
aVand we see that kids learn it more deeply
p273
aVand learn it better.
p274
aVVictor had, I'm sure, been taught about variables in schools,
p275
aVbut he really didn't \u2014 he wasn't paying attention.
p276
aVNow he had a reason for learning variables.
p277
aVSo when you learn through coding, and coding to learn,
p278
aVyou're learning it in a meaningful context, and that's the best way of learning things.
p279
aa(lp280
VSo as kids like Victor are creating projects like this,
p281
aVthey're learning important concepts like variables,
p282
aVbut that's just the start.
p283
aVAs Victor worked on this project and created the scripts,
p284
aVhe was also learning about the process of design,
p285
aVhow to start with the glimmer of an idea
p286
aVand turn it into a fully-fledged, functioning project
p287
aVlike you see here.
p288
aVSo he was learning many different core principles of design,
p289
aVabout how to experiment with new ideas,
p290
aVhow to take complex ideas and break them down into simpler parts,
p291
aVhow to collaborate with other people on your projects,
p292
aVabout how to find and fix bugs when things go wrong,
p293
aVhow to keep persistent and to persevere
p294
aVin the face of frustrations when things aren't working well.
p295
aVNow those are important skills
p296
aVthat aren't just relevant for coding.
p297
aVThey're relevant for all sorts of different activities.
p298
aa(lp299
VNow, who knows if Victor is going to grow up and become
p300
aVa programmer or a professional computer scientist?
p301
aVIt's probably not so likely,
p302
aVbut regardless of what he does,
p303
aVhe'll be able to make use of these design skills that he learned.
p304
aVRegardless of whether he grows up to be a marketing manager
p305
aVor a mechanic or a community organizer,
p306
aVthat these ideas are useful for everybody.
p307
aVAgain, it's useful to think about this analogy with language.
p308
aVWhen you become fluent with reading and writing,
p309
aVit's not something that you're doing
p310
aVjust to become a professional writer.
p311
aVVery few people become professional writers.
p312
aVBut it's useful for everybody to learn how to read and write.
p313
aVAgain, the same thing with coding.
p314
aVMost people won't grow up to become professional
p315
aVcomputer scientists or programmers,
p316
aVbut those skills of thinking creatively,
p317
aVreasoning systematically, working collaboratively \u2014
p318
aVskills you develop when you code in Scratch \u2014
p319
aVare things that people can use no matter what they're doing in their work lives.
p320
aa(lp321
VAnd it's not just about your work life.
p322
aVCoding can also enable you to
p323
aVexpress your ideas and feelings in your personal life.
p324
aVLet me end with just one more example.
p325
aVSo this is an example that came from
p326
aVafter I had sent the Mother's Day cards to my mom,
p327
aVshe decided that she wanted to learn Scratch.
p328
aVSo she made this project for my birthday
p329
aVand sent me a happy birthday Scratch card.
p330
aVNow this project is not going to win any prizes for design,
p331
aVand you can rest assured that my 83-year-old mom
p332
aVis not training to become a professional programmer or computer scientist.
p333
aVBut working on this project enabled her
p334
aVto make a connection to someone that she cares about
p335
aVand enabled her to keep on learning new things
p336
aVand continuing to practice her creativity
p337
aVand developing new ways of expressing herself.
p338
aa(lp339
VSo as we take a look and we see that
p340
aVMichael Bloomberg is learning to code,
p341
aVall of the children of Estonia learn to code,
p342
aVeven my mom has learned to code,
p343
aVdon't you think it's about time that you might be
p344
aVthinking about learning to code?
p345
aVIf you're interested in giving it a try,
p346
aVI'd encourage you to go to the Scratch website.
p347
aVIt's scratch.mit.edu,
p348
aVand give a try at coding.
p349
aa(lp350
VThanks very much. (Applause)
