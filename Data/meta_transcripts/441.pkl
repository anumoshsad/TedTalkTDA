VYou know, I am so bad at tech
p4
aVthat my daughter \u2014 who is now 41 \u2014
p5
aVwhen she was five, was overheard by me
p6
aVto say to a friend of hers,
p7
aVIf it doesn't bleed when you cut it,
p8
aVmy daddy doesn't understand it.
p9
aV(Laughter)
p10
aVSo, the assignment I've been given
p11
aVmay be an insuperable obstacle for me,
p12
aVbut I'm certainly going to try.
p13
aa(lp14
VWhat have I heard
p15
aVduring these last four days?
p16
aVThis is my third visit to TED.
p17
aVOne was to TEDMED, and one, as you've heard,
p18
aVwas a regular TED two years ago.
p19
aVI've heard what I consider an extraordinary thing
p20
aVthat I've only heard a little bit in the two previous TEDs,
p21
aVand what that is is an interweaving
p22
aVand an interlarding, an intermixing,
p23
aVof a sense of social responsibility
p24
aVin so many of the talks \u2014
p25
aVglobal responsibility, in fact,
p26
aVappealing to enlightened self-interest,
p27
aVbut it goes far beyond enlightened self-interest.
p28
aVOne of the most impressive things
p29
aVabout what some, perhaps 10,
p30
aVof the speakers have been talking about
p31
aVis the realization, as you listen to them carefully, that they're not saying:
p32
aVWell, this is what we should do; this is what I would like you to do.
p33
aVIt's: This is what I have done
p34
aVbecause I'm excited by it,
p35
aVbecause it's a wonderful thing, and it's done something for me
p36
aVand, of course, it's accomplished a great deal.
p37
aVIt's the old concept, the real Greek concept,
p38
aVof philanthropy in its original sense:
p39
aVphil-anthropy, the love of humankind.
p40
aa(lp41
VAnd the only explanation I can have
p42
aVfor some of what you've been hearing in the last four days
p43
aVis that it arises, in fact, out of a form of love.
p44
aVAnd this gives me enormous hope.
p45
aVAnd hope, of course, is the topic
p46
aVthat I'm supposed to be speaking about,
p47
aVwhich I'd completely forgotten about until I arrived.
p48
aVAnd when I did, I thought,
p49
aVwell, I'd better look this word up in the dictionary.
p50
aVSo, Sarah and I \u2014 my wife \u2014 walked over to the public library,
p51
aVwhich is four blocks away, on Pacific Street, and we got the OED,
p52
aVand we looked in there, and there are 14 definitions of hope,
p53
aVnone of which really hits you
p54
aVbetween the eyes as being the appropriate one.
p55
aVAnd, of course, that makes sense,
p56
aVbecause hope is an abstract phenomenon; it's an abstract idea,
p57
aVit's not a concrete word.
p58
aa(lp59
VWell, it reminds me a little bit of surgery.
p60
aVIf there's one operation for a disease, you know it works.
p61
aVIf there are 15 operations, you know that none of them work.
p62
aVAnd that's the way it is with definitions of words.
p63
aVIf you have appendicitis, they take your appendix out, and you're cured.
p64
aVIf you've got reflux oesophagitis, there are 15 procedures,
p65
aVand Joe Schmo does it one way
p66
aVand Will Blow does it another way,
p67
aVand none of them work, and that's the way it is with this word, hope.
p68
aVThey all come down to the idea of an expectation
p69
aVof something good that is due to happen.
p70
aVAnd you know what I found out?
p71
aVThe Indo-European root of the word hope
p72
aVis a stem, K-E-U \u2014
p73
aVwe would spell it K-E-U; it's pronounced koy \u2014
p74
aVand it is the same root from which the word curve comes from.
p75
aVBut what it means in the original Indo-European
p76
aVis a change in direction, going in a different way.
p77
aa(lp78
VAnd I find that very interesting and very provocative,
p79
aVbecause what you've been hearing in the last couple of days
p80
aVis the sense of going in different directions:
p81
aVdirections that are specific and unique to problems.
p82
aVThere are different paradigms.
p83
aVYou've heard that word several times in the last four days,
p84
aVand everyone's familiar with Kuhnian paradigms.
p85
aVSo, when we think of hope now,
p86
aVwe have to think of looking in other directions
p87
aVthan we have been looking.
p88
aVThere's another \u2014 not definition, but description, of hope
p89
aVthat has always appealed to me, and it was one by Václav Havel
p90
aVin his perfectly spectacular book "Breaking the Peace,"
p91
aVin which he says that hope
p92
aVdoes not consist of the expectation that things will
p93
aVcome out exactly right,
p94
aVbut the expectation that they will make sense
p95
aVregardless of how they come out.
p96
aa(lp97
VI can't tell you how reassured I was
p98
aVby the very last sentence
p99
aVin that glorious presentation by Dean Kamen a few days ago.
p100
aVI wasn't sure I heard it right,
p101
aVso I found him in one of the inter-sessions.
p102
aVHe was talking to a very large man, but I didn't care.
p103
aVI interrupted, and I said, "Did you say this?"
p104
aVHe said, "I think so."
p105
aVSo, here's what it is: I'll repeat it.
p106
aV"The world will not be saved by the Internet."
p107
aVIt's wonderful. Do you know what the world will be saved by?
p108
aVI'll tell you. It'll be saved by the human spirit.
p109
aVAnd by the human spirit, I don't mean anything divine,
p110
aVI don't mean anything supernatural \u2014
p111
aVcertainly not coming from this skeptic.
p112
aVWhat I mean is this ability
p113
aVthat each of us has
p114
aVto be something greater than herself or himself;
p115
aVto arise out of our ordinary selves and achieve something
p116
aVthat at the beginning we thought perhaps we were not capable of.
p117
aVOn an elemental level, we have all felt
p118
aVthat spirituality at the time of childbirth.
p119
aVSome of you have felt it in laboratories;
p120
aVsome of you have felt it at the workbench.
p121
aVWe feel it at concerts.
p122
aVI've felt it in the operating room, at the bedside.
p123
aVIt is an elevation of us beyond ourselves.
p124
aVAnd I think that it's going to be, in time,
p125
aVthe elements of the human spirit that we've been hearing about
p126
aVbit by bit by bit from so many of the speakers in the last few days.
p127
aVAnd if there's anything that has permeated this room,
p128
aVit is precisely that.
p129
aa(lp130
VI'm intrigued by
p131
aVa concept that was brought to life
p132
aVin the early part of the 19th century \u2014
p133
aVactually, in the second decade of the 19th century \u2014
p134
aVby a 27-year-old poet
p135
aVwhose name was Percy Shelley.
p136
aVNow, we all think that Shelley
p137
aVobviously is the great romantic poet that he was;
p138
aVmany of us tend to forget that he wrote
p139
aVsome perfectly wonderful essays, too,
p140
aVand the most well-remembered essay
p141
aVis one called "A Defence of Poetry."
p142
aVNow, it's about five, six, seven, eight pages long,
p143
aVand it gets kind of deep and difficult after about the third page,
p144
aVbut somewhere on the second page
p145
aVhe begins talking about the notion
p146
aVthat he calls "moral imagination."
p147
aVAnd here's what he says, roughly translated:
p148
aVA man \u2014 generic man \u2014
p149
aVa man, to be greatly good,
p150
aVmust imagine clearly.
p151
aVHe must see himself and the world
p152
aVthrough the eyes of another,
p153
aVand of many others.
p154
aVSee himself and the world \u2014 not just the world, but see himself.
p155
aa(lp156
VWhat is it that is expected of us
p157
aVby the billions of people
p158
aVwho live in what Laurie Garrett the other day
p159
aVso appropriately called
p160
aVdespair and disparity?
p161
aVWhat is it that they have every right
p162
aVto ask of us?
p163
aVWhat is it that we have every right to ask of ourselves,
p164
aVout of our shared humanity and out of the human spirit?
p165
aVWell, you know precisely what it is.
p166
aVThere's a great deal of argument
p167
aVabout whether we, as the great nation that we are,
p168
aVshould be the policeman of the world,
p169
aVthe world's constabulary,
p170
aVbut there should be virtually no argument
p171
aVabout whether we should be the world's healer.
p172
aVThere has certainly been no argument about that
p173
aVin this room in the past four days.
p174
aa(lp175
VSo, if we are to be the world's healer,
p176
aVevery disadvantaged person in this world \u2014
p177
aVincluding in the United States \u2014 becomes our patient.
p178
aVEvery disadvantaged nation, and perhaps our own nation,
p179
aVbecomes our patient.
p180
aVSo, it's fun to think about the etymology of the word "patient."
p181
aVIt comes initially from the Latin patior, to endure, or to suffer.
p182
aVSo, you go back to the old Indo-European root again,
p183
aVand what do you find? The Indo-European stem is pronounced payen \u2014
p184
aVwe would spell it P-A-E-N \u2014 and, lo and behold, mirabile dictu,
p185
aVit is the same root as the word compassion comes from, P-A-E-N.
p186
aa(lp187
VSo, the lesson is very clear. The lesson is that our patient \u2014
p188
aVthe world, and the disadvantaged of the world \u2014
p189
aVthat patient deserves our compassion.
p190
aVBut beyond our compassion, and far greater than compassion,
p191
aVis our moral imagination
p192
aVand our identification with each individual
p193
aVwho lives in that world,
p194
aVnot to think of them as a huge forest,
p195
aVbut as individual trees.
p196
aVOf course, in this day and age, the trick is not to let each tree
p197
aVbe obscured by that Bush in Washington that can get \u2014
p198
aVcan get in the way.
p199
aV(Laughter)
p200
aVSo, here we are.
p201
aVWe are, should be,
p202
aVmorally committed to
p203
aVbeing the healer of the world.
p204
aVAnd we have had examples over and over and over again \u2014
p205
aVyou've just heard one in the last 15 minutes \u2014
p206
aVof people who have not only had that commitment,
p207
aVbut had the charisma, the brilliance \u2014
p208
aVand I think in this room it's easy to use the word brilliant, my God \u2014
p209
aVthe brilliance to succeed at least at the beginning
p210
aVof their quest,
p211
aVand who no doubt will continue to succeed,
p212
aVas long as more and more of us enlist ourselves in their cause.
p213
aa(lp214
VNow, if we're talking
p215
aVabout medicine,
p216
aVand we're talking about healing,
p217
aVI'd like to quote someone who hasn't been quoted.
p218
aVIt seems to me everybody in the world's been quoted here:
p219
aVPogo's been quoted;
p220
aVShakespeare's been quoted backwards, forwards, inside out.
p221
aVI would like to quote one of my own household gods.
p222
aVI suspect he never really said this,
p223
aVbecause we don't know what Hippocrates really said,
p224
aVbut we do know for sure that one of the great Greek physicians
p225
aVsaid the following,
p226
aVand it has been recorded in one of the books attributed to Hippocrates,
p227
aVand the book is called "Precepts."
p228
aVAnd I'll read you what it is.
p229
aVRemember, I have been talking about,
p230
aVessentially philanthropy:
p231
aVthe love of humankind, the individual humankind
p232
aVand the individual humankind
p233
aVthat can bring that kind of love
p234
aVtranslated into action,
p235
aVtranslated, in some cases, into enlightened self-interest.
p236
aVAnd here he is, 2,400 years ago:
p237
aV"Where there is love of humankind,
p238
aVthere is love of healing."
p239
aVWe have seen that here today
p240
aVwith the sense,
p241
aVwith the sensitivity \u2014
p242
aVand in the last three days,
p243
aVand with the power of the indomitable human spirit.
p244
