VFor the past few years,
p4
aVI've been spending my summers in the marine biological laboratory
p5
aVin Woods Hole, Massachusetts.
p6
aVAnd there, what I've been doing is essentially renting a boat.
p7
aVWhat I would like to do is ask you
p8
aVto come on a boat ride with me tonight.
p9
aa(lp10
VSo, we ride off from Eel Pond into Vineyard Sound,
p11
aVright off the coast of Martha's Vineyard,
p12
aVequipped with a drone to identify potential spots
p13
aVfrom which to peer into the Atlantic.
p14
aVEarlier, I was going to say into the depths of the Atlantic,
p15
aVbut we don't have to go too deep to reach the unknown.
p16
aVHere, barely two miles away
p17
aVfrom what is arguably the greatest marine biology lab in the world,
p18
aVwe lower a simple plankton net into the water
p19
aVand bring up to the surface
p20
aVthings that humanity rarely pays any attention to,
p21
aVand oftentimes has never seen before.
p22
aa(lp23
VHere's one of the organisms that we caught in our net.
p24
aVThis is a jellyfish.
p25
aVBut look closely,
p26
aVand living inside of this animal is another organism
p27
aVthat is very likely entirely new to science.
p28
aVA complete new species.
p29
aVOr how about this other transparent beauty
p30
aVwith a beating heart,
p31
aVasexually growing on top of its head,
p32
aVprogeny that will move on to reproduce sexually.
p33
aVLet me say that again:
p34
aVthis animal is growing asexually on top of its head,
p35
aVprogeny that is going to reproduce sexually in the next generation.
p36
aVA weird jellyfish?
p37
aVNot quite.
p38
aVThis is an ascidian.
p39
aVThis is a group of animals
p40
aVthat now we know we share extensive genomic ancestry with,
p41
aVand it is perhaps the closest invertebrate species to our own.
p42
aVMeet your cousin,
p43
aVThalia democratica.
p44
aa(lp45
V(Laughter)
p46
aa(lp47
VI'm pretty sure you didn't save a spot at your last family reunion
p48
aVfor Thalia,
p49
aVbut let me tell you,
p50
aVthese animals are profoundly related to us
p51
aVin ways that we're just beginning to understand.
p52
aVSo, next time you hear anybody derisively telling you
p53
aVthat this type of research is a simple fishing expedition,
p54
aVI hope that you'll remember the trip that we just took.
p55
aa(lp56
VToday, many of the biological sciences only see value
p57
aVin studying deeper what we already know \u2014
p58
aVin mapping already-discovered continents.
p59
aVBut some of us are much more interested in the unknown.
p60
aVWe want to discover completely new continents,
p61
aVand gaze at magnificent vistas of ignorance.
p62
aVWe crave the experience of being completely baffled
p63
aVby something we've never seen before.
p64
aVAnd yes, I agree
p65
aVthere's a lot of little ego satisfaction in being able to say,
p66
aV"Hey, I was the first one to discover that."
p67
aVBut this is not a self-aggrandizing enterprise,
p68
aVbecause in this type of discovery research,
p69
aVif you don't feel like a complete idiot most of the time,
p70
aVyou're just not sciencing hard enough.
p71
aa(lp72
V(Laughter)
p73
aa(lp74
VSo every summer I bring onto the deck of this little boat of ours
p75
aVmore and more things that we know very little about.
p76
aVI would like tonight to tell you a story about life
p77
aVthat rarely gets told in an environment like this.
p78
aVFrom the vantage point of our 21st-century biological laboratories,
p79
aVwe have begun to illuminate many mysteries of life with knowledge.
p80
aVWe sense that after centuries of scientific research,
p81
aVwe're beginning to make significant inroads
p82
aVinto understanding some of the most fundamental principles of life.
p83
aa(lp84
VOur collective optimism is reflected by the growth of biotechnology
p85
aVacross the globe,
p86
aVstriving to utilize scientific knowledge to cure human diseases.
p87
aVThings like cancer, aging, degenerative diseases;
p88
aVthese are but some of the undesirables we wish to tame.
p89
aVI often wonder:
p90
aVWhy is it that we are having so much trouble
p91
aVtrying to solve the problem of cancer?
p92
aVIs it that we're trying to solve the problem of cancer,
p93
aVand not trying to understand life?
p94
aa(lp95
VLife on this planet shares a common origin,
p96
aVand I can summarize 3.5 billion years of the history of life on this planet
p97
aVin a single slide.
p98
aVWhat you see here are representatives of all known species in our planet.
p99
aVIn this immensity of life and biodiversity,
p100
aVwe occupy a rather unremarkable position.
p101
aa(lp102
V(Laughter)
p103
aa(lp104
VHomo sapiens.
p105
aVThe last of our kind.
p106
aVAnd though I don't really want to disparage at all
p107
aVthe accomplishments of our species,
p108
aVas much as we wish it to be so and often pretend that it is,
p109
aVwe are not the measure of all things.
p110
aVWe are, however, the measurers of many things.
p111
aVWe relentlessly quantify, analyze and compare,
p112
aVand some of this is absolutely invaluable and indeed necessary.
p113
aa(lp114
VBut this emphasis today on forcing biological research to specialize
p115
aVand to produce practical outcomes
p116
aVis actually restricting our ability to interrogate life
p117
aVto unacceptably narrow confines and unsatisfying depths.
p118
aVWe are measuring an astonishingly narrow sliver of life,
p119
aVand hoping that those numbers will save all of our lives.
p120
aVHow narrow do you ask?
p121
aVWell, let me give you a number.
p122
aVThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently estimated
p123
aVthat about 95 percent of our oceans remain unexplored.
p124
aVNow let that sink in for a second.
p125
aV95 percent of our oceans remain unexplored.
p126
aVI think it's very safe to say
p127
aVthat we don't even know how much about life we do not know.
p128
aa(lp129
VSo, it's not surprising that every week in my field
p130
aVwe begin to see the addition of more and more new species
p131
aVto this amazing tree of life.
p132
aVThis one for example \u2014
p133
aVdiscovered earlier this summer,
p134
aVnew to science,
p135
aVand now occupying its lonely branch in our family tree.
p136
aVWhat is even more tragic
p137
aVis that we know about a bunch of other species of animals out there,
p138
aVbut their biology remains sorely under-studied.
p139
aa(lp140
VI'm sure some of you have heard about the fact
p141
aVthat a starfish can actually regenerate its arm after it's lost.
p142
aVBut some of you might not know
p143
aVthat the arm itself can actually regenerate a complete starfish.
p144
aVAnd there are animals out there that do truly astounding things.
p145
aVI'm almost willing to bet
p146
aVthat many of you have never heard of the flatworm, Schmidtea mediterranea.
p147
aVThis little guy right here
p148
aVdoes things that essentially just blow my mind.
p149
aVYou can grab one of these animals and cut it into 18 different fragments,
p150
aVand each and every one of those fragments will go on to regenerate
p151
aVa complete animal
p152
aVin under two weeks.
p153
aV18 heads, 18 bodies, 18 mysteries.
p154
aVFor the past decade and a half or so,
p155
aVI've been trying to figure out how these little dudes do what they do,
p156
aVand how they pull this magic trick off.
p157
aVBut like all good magicians,
p158
aVthey're not really releasing their secrets readily to me.
p159
aa(lp160
V(Laughter)
p161
aa(lp162
VSo here we are,
p163
aVafter 20 years of essentially studying these animals,
p164
aVgenome mapping, chin scratching,
p165
aVand thousands of amputations and thousands of regenerations,
p166
aVwe still don't fully understand how these animals do what they do.
p167
aVEach planarian an ocean unto itself,
p168
aVfull of unknowns.
p169
aa(lp170
VOne of the common characteristics
p171
aVof all of these animals I've been talking to you about
p172
aVis that they did not appear to have received the memo
p173
aVthat they need to behave according to the rules
p174
aVthat we have derived from a handful of randomly selected animals
p175
aVthat currently populate the vast majority
p176
aVof biomedical laboratories across the world.
p177
aVMeet our Nobel Prize winners.
p178
aVSeven species, essentially,
p179
aVthat have produced for us the brunt of our understanding
p180
aVof biological behavior today.
p181
aVThis little guy right here \u2014
p182
aVthree Nobel Prizes in 12 years.
p183
aVAnd yet, after all the attention they have garnered,
p184
aVand all the knowledge they have generated,
p185
aVas well as the lion's share of the funding,
p186
aVhere we are standing [before] the same litany of intractable problems
p187
aVand many new challenges.
p188
aVAnd that's because, unfortunately,
p189
aVthese seven animals essentially correspond
p190
aVto 0.0009 percent of all of the species that inhabit the planet.
p191
aa(lp192
VSo I'm beginning to suspect
p193
aVthat our specialization is beginning to impede our progress at best,
p194
aVand at worst, is leading us astray.
p195
aVThat's because life on this planet and its history
p196
aVis the history of rule breakers.
p197
aVLife started on the face of this planet as single-cell organisms,
p198
aVswimming for millions of years in the ocean,
p199
aVuntil one of those creatures decided,
p200
aV"I'm going to do things differently today;
p201
aVtoday I would like to invent something called multicellularity,
p202
aVand I'm going to do this."
p203
aVAnd I'm sure it wasn't a popular decision at the time \u2014
p204
aa(lp205
V(Laughter)
p206
aa(lp207
Vbut somehow, it managed to do it.
p208
aVAnd then, multicellular organisms began to populate
p209
aVall these ancestral oceans,
p210
aVand they thrived.
p211
aVAnd we have them here today.
p212
aVLand masses began to emerge from the surface of the oceans,
p213
aVand another creature thought,
p214
aV"Hey, that looks like a really nice piece of real estate.
p215
aVI'd like to move there."
p216
aV"Are you crazy?
p217
aVYou're going to desiccate out there. Nothing can live out of water."
p218
aVBut life found a way,
p219
aVand there are organisms now that live on land.
p220
aVOnce on land, they may have looked up into the sky
p221
aVand said, "It would be nice to go to the clouds,
p222
aVI'm going to fly."
p223
aV"You can't break the law of gravity, there's no way you can fly."
p224
aVAnd yet, nature has invented \u2014
p225
aVmultiple and independent times \u2014
p226
aVways to fly.
p227
aa(lp228
VI love to study these animals that break the rules,
p229
aVbecause every time they break a rule, they invent something new
p230
aVthat made it possible for us to be able to be here today.
p231
aVThese animals did not get the memo.
p232
aVThey break the rules.
p233
aVSo if we're going to study animals that break the rules,
p234
aVshouldn't how we study them also break the rules?
p235
aa(lp236
VI think we need to renew our spirit of exploration.
p237
aVRather than bring nature into our laboratories
p238
aVand interrogate it there,
p239
aVwe need to bring our science
p240
aVinto the majestic laboratory that is nature,
p241
aVand there, with our modern technological armamentarium,
p242
aVinterrogate every new form of life we find,
p243
aVand any new biological attribute that we may find.
p244
aVWe actually need to bring all of our intelligence
p245
aVto becoming stupid again \u2014
p246
aVclueless [before] the immensity of the unknown.
p247
aVBecause after all,
p248
aVscience is not really about knowledge.
p249
aVScience is about ignorance.
p250
aVThat's what we do.
p251
aa(lp252
VOnce, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry wrote,
p253
aV"If you want to build a ship,
p254
aVdon't drum up people to collect wood
p255
aVand don't assign them tasks and work,
p256
aVbut rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea ..."
p257
aVAs a scientist and a teacher,
p258
aVI like to paraphrase this to read
p259
aVthat we scientists need to teach our students
p260
aVto long for the endless immensity of the sea
p261
aVthat is our ignorance.
p262
aVWe Homo sapiens are the only species we know of
p263
aVthat is driven to scientific inquiry.
p264
aVWe, like all other species on this planet,
p265
aVare inextricably woven into the history of life on this planet.
p266
aVAnd I think I'm a little wrong when I say that life is a mystery,
p267
aVbecause I think that life is actually an open secret
p268
aVthat has been beckoning our species for millennia to understand it.
p269
aa(lp270
VSo I ask you:
p271
aVAren't we the best chance that life has to know itself?
p272
aVAnd if so,
p273
aVwhat the heck are we waiting for?
p274
aa(lp275
VThank you.
