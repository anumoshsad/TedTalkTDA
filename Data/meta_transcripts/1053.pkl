VSo I'm here to tell you that we have a problem with boys,
p4
aVand it's a serious problem with boys.
p5
aVTheir culture isn't working in schools,
p6
aVand I'm going to share with you ways
p7
aVthat we can think about overcoming that problem.
p8
aVFirst, I want to start by saying, this is a boy,
p9
aVand this is a girl,
p10
aVand this is probably stereotypically what you think of as a boy and a girl.
p11
aVIf I essentialize gender for you today, then you can dismiss what I have to say.
p12
aVSo I'm not going to do that, I'm not interested in doing that.
p13
aVThis is a different kind of boy and a different kind of girl.
p14
aVSo the point here is that not all boys exist within these rigid boundaries
p15
aVof what we think of as boys and girls,
p16
aVand not all girls exist within those rigid boundaries
p17
aVof what we think of as girls.
p18
aVBut, in fact, most boys tend to be a certain way,
p19
aVand most girls tend to be a certain way.
p20
aVAnd the point is that, for boys,
p21
aVthe way that they exist and the culture that they embrace
p22
aVisn't working well in schools now.
p23
aa(lp24
VHow do we know that?
p25
aVThe 100 girls project tells us some really nice statistics.
p26
aVFor example, for every 100 girls that are suspended from school,
p27
aVthere are 250 boys that are suspended from school.
p28
aVFor every 100 girls who are expelled from school,
p29
aVthere are 335 boys who are expelled from school.
p30
aVFor every 100 girls in special education,
p31
aVthere are 217 boys.
p32
aVFor every 100 girls with a learning disability,
p33
aVthere are 276 boys.
p34
aVFor every 100 girls with an emotional disturbance diagnosed,
p35
aVwe have 324 boys.
p36
aVAnd by the way, all of these numbers are significantly higher
p37
aVif you happen to be black,
p38
aVif you happen to be poor,
p39
aVif you happen to exist in an overcrowded school.
p40
aVAnd if you are a boy,
p41
aVyou're four times as likely to be diagnosed with ADHD \u2014
p42
aVAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.
p43
aa(lp44
VNow there is another side to this.
p45
aVAnd it is important that we recognize that women still need help in school,
p46
aVthat salaries are still significantly lower,
p47
aVeven when controlled for job types,
p48
aVand that girls have continued to struggle in math and science for years.
p49
aVThat's all true.
p50
aVNothing about that prevents us
p51
aVfrom paying attention to the literacy needs
p52
aVof our boys between ages three and 13.
p53
aVAnd so we should.
p54
aVIn fact, what we ought to do is take a page from their playbook,
p55
aVbecause the initiatives and programs that have been set in place
p56
aVfor women in science and engineering and mathematics are fantastic.
p57
aVThey've done a lot of good for girls in these situations,
p58
aVand we ought to be thinking about how we can make that happen for boys too
p59
aVin their younger years.
p60
aa(lp61
VEven in their older years,
p62
aVwhat we find is that there's still a problem.
p63
aVWhen we look at the universities,
p64
aV60 percent of baccalaureate degrees are going to women now,
p65
aVwhich is a significant shift.
p66
aVAnd in fact, university administrators are a little uncomfortable about the idea
p67
aVthat we may be getting close to 70 percent female population in universities.
p68
aVThis makes university administrators very nervous,
p69
aVbecause girls don't want to go to schools that don't have boys.
p70
aVAnd so we're starting to see
p71
aVthe establishment of men centers and men studies
p72
aVto think about how do we engage men in their experiences in the university.
p73
aVIf you talk to faculty, they may say, "Ugh. Yeah, well,
p74
aVthey're playing video games,
p75
aVand they're gambling online all night long,
p76
aVand they're playing World of Warcraft,
p77
aVand that's affecting their academic achievement."
p78
aVGuess what?
p79
aVVideo games are not the cause.
p80
aVVideo games are a symptom.
p81
aVThey were turned off a long time before they got here.
p82
aa(lp83
VSo let's talk about why they got turned off
p84
aVwhen they were between the ages of three and 13.
p85
aVThere are three reasons that I believe
p86
aVthat boys are out of sync with the culture of schools today.
p87
aVThe first is zero tolerance.
p88
aVA kindergarten teacher I know, her son donated all of his toys to her,
p89
aVand when he did, she had to go through and pull out all the little plastic guns.
p90
aVYou can't have plastic knives and swords and axes
p91
aVand all that kind of thing in a kindergarten classroom.
p92
aVWhat is it that we're afraid that this young man is going to do with this gun?
p93
aVI mean, really.
p94
aVBut here he stands as testament
p95
aVto the fact that you can't roughhouse on the playground today.
p96
aVNow I'm not advocating for bullies.
p97
aVI'm not suggesting that we need to be allowing guns and knives in the school.
p98
aVBut when we say that an Eagle Scout in a high school classroom
p99
aVwho has a locked parked car in the parking lot and a penknife in it,
p100
aVhas to be suspended from school,
p101
aVI think we may have gone a little too far with zero tolerance.
p102
aa(lp103
VAnother way that zero tolerance lives itself out
p104
aVis in the writing of boys.
p105
aVIn a lot of classrooms today,
p106
aVyou're not allowed to write about anything that's violent.
p107
aVYou're not allowed to write about anything that has to do with video games.
p108
aVThese topics are banned.
p109
aVBoy comes home from school, and he says,
p110
aV"I hate writing."
p111
aV"Why do you hate writing, son? What's wrong with writing?"
p112
aV"Now I have to write what she tells me to write."
p113
aV"OK, what is she telling you to write?"
p114
aV"Poems. I have to write poems.
p115
aVAnd little moments in my life.
p116
aVI don't want to write that stuff."
p117
aV"Well, what do you want to write?
p118
aVWhat do you want to write about?"
p119
aV"I want to write about video games. I want to write about leveling-up.
p120
aVI want to write about this really interesting world.
p121
aVI want to write about a tornado that comes into our house
p122
aVand blows all the windows out,
p123
aVand ruins all the furniture and kills everybody."
p124
aV"All right. OK."
p125
aVYou tell a teacher that, and they'll ask you, in all seriousness,
p126
aV"Should we send this child to the psychologist?"
p127
aVAnd the answer is no, he's just a boy.
p128
aVHe's just a little boy.
p129
aVIt's not OK to write these kinds of things in classrooms today.
p130
aa(lp131
VSo that's the first reason:
p132
aVZero tolerance policies and the way they're lived out.
p133
aVThe next reason that boys' cultures are out of sync with school cultures:
p134
aVthere are fewer male teachers.
p135
aVAnybody who's over 15 doesn't know what this means,
p136
aVbecause in the last 10 years,
p137
aVthe number of elementary school classroom teachers has been cut in half.
p138
aVWe went from 14 percent to seven percent.
p139
aVThat means that 93 percent of the teachers
p140
aVthat our young men get in elementary classrooms are women.
p141
aVNow what's the problem with this?
p142
aVWomen are great, yep, absolutely.
p143
aVBut male role models for boys that say it's all right to be smart \u2014
p144
aVthey've got dads, they've got pastors, they've got Cub Scout leaders,
p145
aVbut ultimately, six hours a day, five days a week
p146
aVthey're spending in a classroom,
p147
aVand most of those classrooms are not places where men exist.
p148
aVAnd so they say, I guess this really isn't a place for boys.
p149
aVThis is a place for girls.
p150
aVAnd I'm not very good at this,
p151
aVso I guess I'd better go play video games
p152
aVor get into sports, or something like that,
p153
aVbecause I obviously don't belong here.
p154
aVMen don't belong here, that's pretty obvious.
p155
aa(lp156
VSo that may be a very direct way that we see it happen.
p157
aVBut less directly, the lack of male presence in the culture \u2014
p158
aVyou've got a teachers' lounge, and they're having a conversation
p159
aVabout Joey and Johnny who beat each other up on the playground.
p160
aV"What are we going to do with these boys?"
p161
aVThe answer to that question changes
p162
aVdepending on who's sitting around that table.
p163
aVAre there men around that table?
p164
aVAre there moms who've raised boys around that table?
p165
aVYou'll see, the conversation changes
p166
aVdepending upon who's sitting around the table.
p167
aa(lp168
VThird reason that boys are out of sync with school today:
p169
aVKindergarten is the old second grade, folks.
p170
aVWe have a serious compression of the curriculum happening out there.
p171
aVWhen you're three, you better be able to write your name legibly,
p172
aVor else we'll consider it a developmental delay.
p173
aVBy the time you're in first grade,
p174
aVyou should be able to read paragraphs of text
p175
aVwith maybe a picture, maybe not, in a book of maybe 25 to 30 pages.
p176
aVIf you don't,
p177
aVwe're probably going to be putting you into a Title I special reading program.
p178
aVAnd if you ask Title I teachers, they'll tell you
p179
aVthey've got about four or five boys for every girl that's in their program,
p180
aVin the elementary grades.
p181
aa(lp182
VThe reason that this is a problem
p183
aVis because the message that boys are getting
p184
aVis, "You need to do what the teacher asks you to do all the time."
p185
aVThe teacher's salary depends on "No Child Left Behind"
p186
aVand "Race to the Top" and accountability and testing
p187
aVand all of this.
p188
aVSo she has to figure out a way to get all these boys
p189
aVthrough this curriculum \u2014 and girls.
p190
aVThis compressed curriculum is bad for all active kids.
p191
aVAnd what happens is,
p192
aVshe says, "Please, sit down, be quiet, do what you're told,
p193
aVfollow the rules, manage your time, focus, be a girl."
p194
aVThat's what she tells them.
p195
aVIndirectly, that's what she tells them.
p196
aVAnd so this is a very serious problem.
p197
aVWhere is it coming from? It's coming from us.
p198
aa(lp199
V(Laughter)
p200
aa(lp201
VWe want our babies to read when they are six months old.
p202
aVHave you seen the ads?
p203
aVWe want to live in Lake Wobegon where every child is above average ...
p204
aVbut what this does to our children is really not healthy.
p205
aVIt's not developmentally appropriate,
p206
aVand it's particularly bad for boys.
p207
aa(lp208
VSo what do we do?
p209
aVWe need to meet them where they are.
p210
aVWe need to put ourselves into boy culture.
p211
aVWe need to change the mindset of acceptance in boys
p212
aVin elementary schools.
p213
aVMore specifically, we can do some very specific things.
p214
aVWe can design better games.
p215
aVMost of the educational games that are out there today
p216
aVare really flashcards.
p217
aVThey're glorified drill and practice.
p218
aVThey don't have the depth, the rich narrative
p219
aVthat really engaging video games have,
p220
aVthat the boys are really interested in.
p221
aVSo we need to design better games.
p222
aVWe need to talk to teachers and parents and school board members and politicians.
p223
aVWe need to make sure that people see that we need more men in the classroom.
p224
aVWe need to look carefully at our zero tolerance policies.
p225
aVDo they make sense?
p226
aVWe need to think about how to uncompress this curriculum if we can,
p227
aVtrying to bring boys back into a space that is comfortable for them.
p228
aVAll of those conversations need to be happening.
p229
aa(lp230
VThere are some great examples out there of schools \u2014
p231
aVthe New York Times just talked about a school recently.
p232
aVA game designer from the New School
p233
aVput together a wonderful video gaming school.
p234
aVBut it only treats a few kids, and so this isn't very scalable.
p235
aVWe have to change the culture and the feelings
p236
aVthat politicians and school board members and parents have
p237
aVabout the way we accept and what we accept in our schools today.
p238
aVWe need to find more money for game design.
p239
aVBecause good games, really good games, cost money,
p240
aVand World of Warcraft has quite a budget.
p241
aVMost of the educational games do not.
p242
aa(lp243
VWhere we started:
p244
aVmy colleagues Mike Petner, Shawn Vashaw, myself,
p245
aVwe started by trying to look at the teachers' attitudes
p246
aVand find out how do they really feel about gaming,
p247
aVwhat do they say about it.
p248
aVAnd we discovered that they talk about the kids in their school,
p249
aVwho talk about gaming, in pretty demeaning ways.
p250
aVThey say, "Oh, yeah. They're always talking about that stuff.
p251
aVThey're talking about their little action figures
p252
aVand their little achievements or merit badges,
p253
aVor whatever it is that they get.
p254
aVAnd they're always talking about this stuff."
p255
aVAnd they say these things as if it's OK.
p256
aVBut if it were your culture, think of how that might feel.
p257
aVIt's very uncomfortable to be on the receiving end
p258
aVof that kind of language.
p259
aVThey're nervous about anything that has anything to do with violence
p260
aVbecause of the zero tolerance policies.
p261
aVThey are sure that parents and administrators
p262
aVwill never accept anything.
p263
aa(lp264
VSo we really need to think about looking at teacher attitudes
p265
aVand finding ways to change the attitudes,
p266
aVso that teachers are much more open and accepting of boy cultures
p267
aVin their classrooms.
p268
aVBecause, ultimately, if we don't,
p269
aVthen we're going to have boys who leave elementary school saying,
p270
aV"Well I guess that was just a place for girls, it wasn't for me.
p271
aVSo I've got to do gaming, or I've got to do sports."
p272
aVIf we change these things, if we pay attention to these things,
p273
aVand we reengage boys in their learning,
p274
aVthey will leave the elementary schools saying, "I'm smart."
p275
aa(lp276
