VI had requested slides,
p4
aVkind of adamantly,
p5
aVup till the \u2014 pretty much, last few days,
p6
aVbut was denied access to a slide projector.
p7
aV(Laughter)
p8
aVI actually find them a lot more emotional \u2014
p9
aV(Laughter)
p10
aV\u2014 and personal,
p11
aVand the neat thing about a slide projector
p12
aVis you can actually focus the work,
p13
aVunlike PowerPoint and some other programs.
p14
aVNow, I agree that
p15
aVyou have to \u2014 yeah, there are certain concessions
p16
aVand, you know, if you use a slide projector,
p17
aVyou're not able to have the bad type
p18
aVswing in from the back or the side, or up or down,
p19
aVbut maybe that's an O.K. trade-off,
p20
aVto trade that off for a focus.
p21
aV(Laughter)
p22
aVIt's a thought. Just a thought.
p23
aVAnd there's something nice about slides getting stuck.
p24
aVAnd the thing you really hope for
p25
aVis occasionally they burn up,
p26
aVwhich we won't see tonight. So.
p27
aa(lp28
VWith that, let's get the first slide up here.
p29
aVThis, as many of you have probably guessed,
p30
aVis a
p31
aVrecently emptied beer can in Portugal.
p32
aV(Laughter)
p33
aVThis \u2014 I had just arrived in Barcelona for the first time,
p34
aVand I thought \u2014
p35
aVyou know, fly all night, I looked up,
p36
aVand I thought, wow, how clean.
p37
aVYou come into this major airport, and they simply have a B.
p38
aVI mean, how nice is that?
p39
aVEverything's gotten simpler in design,
p40
aVand here's this mega airport,
p41
aVand God, I just \u2014 I took a picture.
p42
aVI thought, God, that is the coolest thing I've ever seen at an airport.
p43
aVTill a couple months later,
p44
aVI went back to the same airport \u2014
p45
aVsame plane, I think \u2014 and looked up,
p46
aVand it said C.
p47
aV(Laughter)
p48
aVIt was only then that I realized
p49
aVit was simply a gate that I was coming into.
p50
aV(Laughter)
p51
aa(lp52
VI'm a big believer in the emotion of design,
p53
aVand the message that's sent
p54
aVbefore somebody begins to read,
p55
aVbefore they get the rest of the information;
p56
aVwhat is the emotional response they get to the product,
p57
aVto the story, to the painting \u2014 whatever it is.
p58
aVThat area of design interests me the most,
p59
aVand I think this for me is a real clear,
p60
aVvery simplified version
p61
aVof what I'm talking about.
p62
aVThese are a couple of garage doors painted identical,
p63
aVsituated next to each other.
p64
aVSo, here's the first door. You know, you get the message.
p65
aVYou know, it's pretty clear.
p66
aVTake a look at the second door and see
p67
aVif there's any different message.
p68
aVO.K., which one would you park in front of?
p69
aV(Laughter)
p70
aVSame color, same message, same words.
p71
aVThe only thing that's different
p72
aVis the expression that the individual door-owner here put into the piece \u2014
p73
aVand, again,
p74
aVwhich is the psycho-killer here?
p75
aV(Laughter)
p76
aVYet it doesn't say that; it doesn't need to say that.
p77
aVI would probably park in front of the other one.
p78
aa(lp79
VI'm sure a lot of you are aware
p80
aVthat graphic design has gotten a lot simpler in the last
p81
aVfive years or so.
p82
aVIt's gotten so simple that it's already starting to kind of
p83
aVcome back the other way again and get a little more expressive.
p84
aVBut I was in Milan and saw this street sign,
p85
aVand was very happy to
p86
aVsee that apparently this idea of minimalism
p87
aVhas even been translated by the graffiti artist.
p88
aV(Laughter)
p89
aVAnd this graffiti artist has come along,
p90
aVmade this sign a little bit better, and then moved on.
p91
aV(Laughter)
p92
aVHe didn't overpower it like they have a tendency to do.
p93
aV(Laughter)
p94
aa(lp95
VThis is for a book by "Metropolis."
p96
aVI took some photos, and this is
p97
aVa billboard in Florida,
p98
aVand either they hadn't paid their rent,
p99
aVor they didn't want to pay their rent again on the sign,
p100
aVand the billboard people were too cheap to tear the whole sign down,
p101
aVso they just teared out sections of it.
p102
aVAnd I would argue that it's possibly more effective
p103
aVthan the original billboard in terms of getting your attention,
p104
aVgetting you to look over that way.
p105
aVAnd hopefully you don't stop and buy those awful pecan things \u2014 Stuckey's.
p106
aa(lp107
VThis is from my second book.
p108
aVThe first book is called, "The End of Print,"
p109
aVand it was done along with a film,
p110
aVworking with William Burroughs.
p111
aVAnd "The End of Print" is now in its fifth printing.
p112
aV(Laughter)
p113
aVWhen I first contacted William Burroughs about being part of it,
p114
aVhe said no; he said he didn't believe it was the end of print.
p115
aVAnd I said, well, that's fine;
p116
aVI just would love to have your input on this film and this book,
p117
aVand he finally agreed to it.
p118
aVAnd at the end of the film, he says in this great voice
p119
aVthat I can't mimic but I'll kind of try, but not really, he says,
p120
aV"I remember attending an exhibition called,
p121
aV'Photography: The End of Painting.'"
p122
aVAnd then he says, "And, of course, it wasn't at all."
p123
aVSo, apparently when photography was perfected,
p124
aVthere were people going around saying,
p125
aVthat's it: you've just ruined painting.
p126
aVPeople are just going to take pictures now.
p127
aVAnd of course, that wasn't the case.
p128
aa(lp129
VSo, this is from "2nd Sight,"
p130
aVa book I did on intuition.
p131
aVI think it's not the only ingredient in design,
p132
aVbut possibly the most important.
p133
aVIt's something everybody has.
p134
aVIt's not a matter of teaching it;
p135
aVin fact, most of the schools tend to discount intuition
p136
aVas an ingredient of your working process
p137
aVbecause they can't quantify it:
p138
aVit's very hard to teach people the four steps to intuitive design,
p139
aVbut we can teach you the four steps to a nice business card
p140
aVor a newsletter.
p141
aVSo it tends to get discounted.
p142
aVThis is a quote from Albert Einstein, who says,
p143
aV"The intellect has little to do on the road to discovery.
p144
aVThere comes a leap in consciousness \u2014
p145
aVcall it intuition or what you will \u2014
p146
aVand the solution just comes to you, and you don't know from where or why."
p147
aVSo, it's kind of like when somebody says, Who did that song?
p148
aVAnd the more you try to think about it,
p149
aVthe further the answer gets from you,
p150
aVand the minute you stop thinking about it,
p151
aVyour intuition gives you that answer, in a sense.
p152
aa(lp153
VI like this for a couple of reasons.
p154
aVIf you've had any design courses, they would teach you you can't read this.
p155
aVI think you eventually can and, more importantly, I think it's true.
p156
aV"Don't mistake legibility for communication."
p157
aVJust because something's legible doesn't means it communicates.
p158
aVMore importantly, it doesn't mean it communicates the right thing.
p159
aVSo, what is the message sent before
p160
aVsomebody actually gets into the material?
p161
aVAnd I think that's sometimes an overlooked area.
p162
aa(lp163
VThis is working with Marshall McLuhan.
p164
aVI stayed and worked with his wife and son, Eric,
p165
aVand we came up with close to 600 quotes from Marshall
p166
aVthat are just amazing in terms of being ahead of the times,
p167
aVpredicting so much of what has happened
p168
aVin the advertising, television, media world.
p169
aVAnd so this book is called "Probes." It's another word for quotes.
p170
aVAnd it's \u2014 a lot of them are never \u2014 have never been published before,
p171
aVand basically, I've interpreted the different quotes.
p172
aVSo, this was the contents page originally.
p173
aVWhen I got done it was 540 pages,
p174
aVand then the publisher, Gingko Press,
p175
aVended up cutting it down considerably:
p176
aVit's just under 400 pages now.
p177
aVBut I decided I liked this contents page \u2014
p178
aVI liked the way it looks \u2014 so I kept it.
p179
aV(Laughter)
p180
aVIt now has no relevance to the book whatsoever,
p181
aVbut it's a nice spread, I think, in there.
p182
aV(Laughter)
p183
aa(lp184
VSo, a couple spreads from the book:
p185
aVhere McLuhan says,
p186
aV"The new media are not bridges between Man and Nature; they are Nature."
p187
aV"The invention of printing did away with anonymity,
p188
aVfostering ideas of literary fame
p189
aVand the habit of considering intellectual effort as private property,"
p190
aVwhich had never been done before printing.
p191
aV"When new technologies impose themselves
p192
aVon societies long habituated to older technologies,
p193
aVanxieties of all kinds result."
p194
aV"While people are engaged in creating a totally different world,
p195
aVthey always form vivid images of the preceding world."
p196
aVI hate this stuff. It's hard to read.
p197
aV(Laughter)
p198
aV(Applause)
p199
aV"People in the electronic age have no possible environment except the globe,
p200
aVand no possible occupation except information gathering."
p201
aVThat was it. That's all he saw as the options. And not too far off.
p202
aa(lp203
VSo, this is a project for Nine Inch Nails.
p204
aVAnd I only show it because it seemed like it got all this relevancy all of a sudden,
p205
aVand it was done right after 9/11.
p206
aVAnd I had recently discovered a bomb shelter
p207
aVin the backyard of a house I had bought in LA
p208
aVthat the real estate person hadn't pointed out.
p209
aV(Laughter)
p210
aVThere was some bomb shelter built, apparently in the '60s Cuban missile crisis.
p211
aVAnd I asked the real estate guy what it was as we were walking by,
p212
aVand he goes, "It's something to do with the sewage system."
p213
aVI was, O.K.; that's fine.
p214
aVI finally went down there, and it was this old rusted circular thing,
p215
aVand two beds, and very kind of creepy and weird.
p216
aVAnd also, surprisingly, it was done in kind of a cheap metal,
p217
aVand it had completely rusted through, and water everywhere, and spiders.
p218
aVAnd I thought, you know, what were they thinking?
p219
aVYou'd think maybe cement, possibly, or something.
p220
aVBut anyway, I used this for a cover for the Nine Inch Nails DVD,
p221
aVand I've also now fixed the bomb shelter with duct tape,
p222
aVand it's ready. I think I'm ready. So.
p223
aa(lp224
VThis is an experiment, really, for a client, Quicksilver,
p225
aVwhere we were taking what was a six-shot sequence
p226
aVand trying to use print as a medium to get people to the Web.
p227
aVSo, this is a six-shot sequence.
p228
aVI've taken one shot; I cropped it a few different ways.
p229
aVAnd then the tiny line of copy says,
p230
aVIf you want to see this entire sequence \u2014
p231
aVhow this whole ride was \u2014 go to the website.
p232
aVAnd my guess is that a lot of the surf kids did go to the site
p233
aVto get this entire picture.
p234
aVGot no way of tracking it, so I could be totally wrong.
p235
aV(Laughter)
p236
aVI don't have the site. It's just the piece itself.
p237
aa(lp238
VThis is a group in New York called the Coalition for a Smoke-free Environment \u2014
p239
aVasked me to do these posters.
p240
aVThey were wild-posted around New York City.
p241
aVYou can't really \u2014 well, you can't see it at all \u2014
p242
aVbut the second line is really the more kind of payoff, in a sense.
p243
aVIt says, "If the cigarette companies can lie, then so can we." But \u2014
p244
aV(Laughter)
p245
aV(Applause)
p246
aV\u2014 but I did.
p247
aVThese were literally wild-posted all over New York one night,
p248
aVand there were definitely some heads turning,
p249
aVyou know, people smoking and, "Huh!"
p250
aV(Laughter)
p251
aVAnd it was purposely done to look fairly serious.
p252
aVIt wasn't some, you know, weird grunge type or something;
p253
aVit looked like they might be real. Anyway.
p254
aa(lp255
VPoster for Atlantic Center for the Arts, a school in Florida.
p256
aa(lp257
VThis amazes me. This is a product I just found out.
p258
aVI was in the Caribbean at Christmas,
p259
aVand I'm just blown away that in this day and age they will still sell \u2014
p260
aVnot that they will sell \u2014
p261
aVthat there is felt a need for people to lighten the color of their skin.
p262
aVThis was either an old product with new packaging,
p263
aVor a brand-new package, and I just thought,
p264
aVYikes! How's that still happening?
p265
aa(lp266
VI do a lot of workshops all over the world, really,
p267
aVand this particular assignment was
p268
aVto come up with new symbols for the restroom doors.
p269
aV(Laughter)
p270
aVI felt this was one of the more successful solutions.
p271
aVThe students actually cut them up
p272
aVand put them up around bars and restaurants that night,
p273
aVand I just always have this vision of this elderly couple going to use the restroom ...
p274
aV(Laughter)
p275
aa(lp276
VI did some work for Microsoft a few years back.
p277
aVIt was a worldwide branding campaign.
p278
aVAnd it was interesting to me \u2014
p279
aVmy background is in sociology; I had no design training,
p280
aVand sometimes people say, well, that explains it \u2014
p281
aVbut it was a very interesting experiment
p282
aVbecause there's no product that I had to sell;
p283
aVit was simply the image of Microsoft they were trying to improve.
p284
aVThey thought some people didn't like them.
p285
aV(Laughter)
p286
aVI found out that's very true,
p287
aVworking on this campaign worldwide.
p288
aa(lp289
VAnd our goal was to try to humanize them a bit,
p290
aVand what I did was add type and people to the ad,
p291
aVwhich the previous campaign had not had,
p292
aVand nobody remembered them, and nobody referenced them.
p293
aVAnd we were trying to say that,
p294
aVhey, some of these guys that work there are actually OK;
p295
aVsome of them actually have friends and family,
p296
aVand they're not all awful people.
p297
aVAnd the umbrella campaign was "Thank God it's Monday."
p298
aVSo, we tried to take this \u2014
p299
aVwhat was perceived as a negative:
p300
aVtheir over-competitiveness, their,
p301
aVyou know, long working hours \u2014
p302
aVand turn it into a positive and not run from it.
p303
aVYou know: Thank God it's Monday \u2014
p304
aVI get to go back to that little cubicle, those fake gray walls,
p305
aVand hear everybody else's conversations f
p306
aVor 10 hours and then go home.
p307
aa(lp308
VBut anyway, this is one of the ads I was most pleased with,
p309
aVbecause they were all elaborately art-directed,
p310
aVand this one I thought actually felt like the girl was looking at the computer.
p311
aVIt says, "Wonder Around." And then it's a piece of the software.
p312
aVAnd this is how the ad ran around the world.
p313
aVIn Germany, they made one small change without checking with me \u2014
p314
aVnor did they have to, because it was done through agencies \u2014
p315
aVbut see if you can tell the difference.
p316
aVThis is how the ad ran throughout the world;
p317
aVGermany made one slight change in the ad.
p318
aV(Laughter)
p319
aa(lp320
VNow, there's kind of two issues here.
p321
aVIf you're going to put a kid in the ad, pick one that looks alive.
p322
aV(Laughter)
p323
aVI just have a feeling this kid's been there for a week, you know.
p324
aVHe's just really hoping that boots up and, you know ...
p325
aV(Laughter)
p326
aVAnd then as the agency explained to me, they said,
p327
aV"Look, we don't have little green people in our country;
p328
aVwhy would we put little green people in our ads, for instance?"
p329
aVSo, I understand their logic. I totally disagree with it;
p330
aVI think it's a very small-minded approach,
p331
aVthe world is certainly much more global,
p332
aVand I certainly think the people of Germany
p333
aVcould have handled a little black girl sitting in front of a computer,
p334
aVthough we'll never know.
p335
aa(lp336
VThis is some work from Ray Gun.
p337
aVAnd the point of this magazine was to read the articles,
p338
aVlisten to the music, and try to interpret it.
p339
aVThere's no grid, there's no system, there's nothing set up in advance.
p340
aVThis is an opener for Brian Eno,
p341
aVand it's just kind of my personal interpretation of the music.
p342
aVThis is rockstars talking about teachers they had lusted after in school.
p343
aVThere's a lot of great writing in "Ray Gun."
p344
aVAnd I was fortunate to find a photograph of a teacher sitting on some books.
p345
aV(Laughter)
p346
aa(lp347
VArticle on Bryan Ferry \u2014 just really boring article \u2014
p348
aVso I set the whole article in Dingbat.
p349
aV(Laughter)
p350
aVYou could \u2014 you could highlight it; you could make it Helvetica or something:
p351
aVit is the actual article.
p352
aVI suppose you could eventually decode it,
p353
aVbut it's really not very well written; it really wouldn't be worthwhile.
p354
aV(Laughter)
p355
aa(lp356
VHaving done a lot of magazines,
p357
aVI'm very curious how big magazines handle big stories,
p358
aVand I was very curious to see how Time and Newsweek would handle 9/11.
p359
aVAnd I was basically pretty disappointed
p360
aVto see that they had
p361
aVchosen to show the photo we'd already seen a million times,
p362
aVwhich was basically the moment of impact.
p363
aVAnd People magazine, I thought,
p364
aVgot probably the best shot.
p365
aVIt's kind of horsey type, but the texture \u2014
p366
aVthe second plane not quite hitting:
p367
aVthere was something more enticing,
p368
aVif that's the right \u2014 it's not the right word \u2014
p369
aVbut in this cover than Time or Newsweek.
p370
aa(lp371
VBut when I got into this magazine,
p372
aVthere's something kind of disturbing, and this continued.
p373
aVOn the left we see people dying; we see people running for their lives.
p374
aVAnd on the right we learn that there's a new way to support your breast.
p375
aVThe coveted right-hand page was not given up to the whole issue.
p376
aVLook at the image of this lady \u2014
p377
aVwho knows what she's going through? \u2014
p378
aVand the copy says: "He knows just how to give me goosebumps."
p379
aVYeah, he jumps out of buildings. It's \u2014
p380
aVunfortunately, this one works, kind of, as a spread.
p381
aa(lp382
VAnd this continued through the entire magazine.
p383
aVIt did not let up.
p384
aVThis says: "One clean fits all." .
p385
aVThere were a lot of orphans made this day,
p386
aVand here's a dead body being brought out.
p387
aVIt just seems to me possibly even a blank page
p388
aVwould have been more appropriate.
p389
aVAnd this one I think is possibly the worst:
p390
aVtwo ladies, both facing the same way, both wearing jeans.
p391
aVOne \u2014 who knows what she's going through;
p392
aVthe other one is worried about model behavior and milk.
p393
aa(lp394
VAnd \u2014
p395
aVI gave a talk in New York a couple months after this,
p396
aVand afterwards somebody came up to me and they said that \u2014
p397
aVthey actually emailed me \u2014 and they said that they appreciated the talk,
p398
aVand when they got back to their car,
p399
aVthey found a note on their car that made them think
p400
aVmaybe New York was getting back to being New York again after this event \u2014
p401
aVit had been a few months.
p402
aVThis was what they found on their car.
p403
aV(Laughter)
p404
aVThere's very few times you'd be happy to find this on your car,
p405
aVbut it did seem to indicate that we were coming back.
p406
aa(lp407
VThis is my desktop.
p408
aVSomebody told me today there was this thing called folders,
p409
aVbut I don't know what they are.
p410
aVThese are my notes for the talk \u2014 there might be a correlation here.
p411
aVWe are wrapping up.
p412
aa(lp413
VThis I saw on the plane, flying in, for hot new products.
p414
aVI'm not sure this is an improvement, or a good idea,
p415
aVbecause, like, if you don't spend quite enough time in front of your computer,
p416
aVyou can now get a plate in the keyboard,
p417
aVso there's no more faking it \u2014
p418
aVthat you don't really sit at your desk all day and eat and work anyway.
p419
aVNow there's a plate, and it would be really, really convenient

VIf you ever doubt the power of graphic design,
p424
aVthis is a very generic sign that literally says, "Vote for Hitler." It says nothing else.
p425
aVAnd this to me is an extreme case
p426
aVof the power of emotion, of graphic design,
p427
aVeven though, in fact, was a very generic poster at the time.

VWhat's next? What's next is going to be people.
p430
aVAs we get more technically driven,
p431
aVthe importance of people becomes more than it's ever been before.
p432
aVYou have to utilize who you are in your work.
p433
aVNobody else can do that: nobody else can pull from your background,
p434
aVfrom your parents, your upbringing, your whole life experience.
p435
aVIf you allow that to happen, it's really the only way you can do some unique work,
p436
aVand you're going to enjoy the work a lot more as well.

VThis is \u2014 I like found art; hand lettering's coming back in a big way,

aVand I thought this was a great example of both.

aVThis lady's advertising for her lost pit bull.
p441
aVIt's friendly \u2014 she's underlined friendly \u2014
p442
aVthat's probably why she calls it Hercules or Hercles. She can't spell.
p443
aV(Laughter)
p444
aVBut more importantly,
p445
aVshe's willing to give you 20 bucks to go find this lost pit bull.
p446
aVAnd I'm thinking, yeah, right,
p447
aVI'll go look for a lost pit bill for 20 bucks.
p448
aVI have visions of people going down alleyways yelling out for Hercles,
p449
aVand you get charged by this thing and you go,
p450
aVoh, please be Hercles; please be the friendly one.
p451
aV(Laughter)
p452
aVI'm sure she never found the dog, because I took the sign.

VBut I was asked to give a talk at a conference in Sacramento a few years back.
p456
aVAnd the theme was courage, and they asked me to talk
p457
aVabout how courageous it is to be a graphic designer.
p458
aVAnd I remembered seeing this photograph of my father,
p459
aVwho was a test pilot, and he told me that
p460
aVwhen you signed up to become a test pilot,
p461
aVthey told you that there was a 40 to 50 percent chance
p462
aVof death on the job.
p463
aVThat's pretty high for most occupations.
p464
aV(Laughter)
p465
aVBut, you know, the government would make a plane;
p466
aVthey'd say, go see if that one flies, would you?
p467
aVSome of them did; some of them didn't.
p468
aa(lp469
VAnd I started thinking about some of these decisions I have to make
p470
aVbetween, like, serif versus san-serif.
p471
aV(Laughter)
p472
aVAnd for the most part, they're not real life-threatening.
p473
aVWhy not experiment? Why not have some fun?
p474
aVWhy not put some of yourself into the work?
p475
aVAnd when I was teaching, I used to always ask the students,
p476
aVWhat's the definition of a good job?
p477
aVAnd as teachers, after you get all the answers,
p478
aVyou like to give them the correct answer.
p479
aVAnd the best one I've heard \u2014 I'm sure some of you have heard this \u2014
p480
aVthe definition of a good job is:
p481
aVIf you could afford to \u2014 if money wasn't an issue \u2014
p482
aVwould you be doing that same work?
p483
aVAnd if you would, you've got a great job.
p484
aVAnd if you wouldn't, what the heck are you doing?
