VIn India, we have these huge families.
p4
aVI bet a lot of you all must have heard about it.
p5
aVWhich means that there are a lot of family events.
p6
aVSo as a child, my parents used to drag me to these family events.
p7
aa(lp8
VBut the one thing that I always looked forward to
p9
aVwas playing around with my cousins.
p10
aVAnd there was always this one uncle
p11
aVwho used to be there,
p12
aValways ready, jumping around with us,
p13
aVhaving games for us,
p14
aVmaking us kids have the time of our lives.
p15
aVThis man was extremely successful:
p16
aVhe was confident and powerful.
p17
aVBut then I saw this hale and hearty person deteriorate in health.
p18
aVHe was diagnosed with Parkinson's.
p19
aa(lp20
VParkinson's is a disease that causes degeneration of the nervous system,
p21
aVwhich means that this person who used to be independent
p22
aVsuddenly finds tasks like drinking coffee, because of tremors, much more difficult.
p23
aVMy uncle started using a walker to walk,
p24
aVand to take a turn,
p25
aVhe literally had to take one step at a time, like this,
p26
aVand it took forever.
p27
aVSo this person, who used to be the center of attention
p28
aVin every family gathering,
p29
aVwas suddenly hiding behind people.
p30
aVHe was hiding from the pitiful look in people's eyes.
p31
aa(lp32
VAnd he's not the only one in the world.
p33
aVEvery year, 60,000 people are newly diagnosed with Parkinson's,
p34
aVand this number is only rising.
p35
aVAs designers, we dream that our designs solve these multifaceted problems,
p36
aVone solution that solves it all,
p37
aVbut it need not always be like that.
p38
aVYou can also target simple problems
p39
aVand create small solutions for them and eventually make a big impact.
p40
aVSo my aim here was to not cure Parkinson's,
p41
aVbut to make their everyday tasks much more simple,
p42
aVand then make an impact.
p43
aa(lp44
VWell, the first thing I targeted was tremors, right?
p45
aVMy uncle told me that he had stopped drinking coffee or tea in public
p46
aVjust out of embarrassment,
p47
aVso, well, I designed the no-spill cup.
p48
aVIt works just purely on its form.
p49
aVThe curve on top deflects the liquid back inside every time they have tremors,
p50
aVand this keeps the liquid inside compared to a normal cup.
p51
aVBut the key here is that it is not tagged as a Parkinson's patient product.
p52
aVIt looks like a cup that could be used by you, me, any clumsy person,
p53
aVand that makes it much more comforting for them to use, to blend in.
p54
aVSo, well, one problem solved,
p55
aVmany more to go.
p56
aa(lp57
VAll this while, I was interviewing him,
p58
aVquestioning him,
p59
aVand then I realized that I was getting very superficial information,
p60
aVor just answers to my questions.
p61
aVBut I really needed to dig deeper to get a new perspective.
p62
aVSo I thought, well, let's observe him in his daily tasks,
p63
aVwhile he's eating, while he's watching TV.
p64
aVAnd then, when I was actually observing him walking to his dining table,
p65
aVit struck me, this man who finds it so difficult to walk on flat land,
p66
aVhow does he climb a staircase?
p67
aVBecause in India we do not have a fancy rail that takes you up a staircase
p68
aVlike in the developed countries.
p69
aVOne actually has to climb the stairs.
p70
aVSo he told me,
p71
aV"Well, let me show you how I do it."
p72
aVLet's take a look at what I saw.
p73
aa(lp74
VSo he took really long to reach this position,
p75
aVand then all this while, I'm thinking,
p76
aV"Oh my God, is he really going to do it?
p77
aVIs he really, really going to do it without his walker?"
p78
aVAnd then ...
p79
aa(lp80
V(Laughter)
p81
aa(lp82
VAnd the turns, he took them so easily.
p83
aa(lp84
VSo \u2014 shocked?
p85
aVWell, I was too.
p86
aVSo this person who could not walk on flat land
p87
aVwas suddenly a pro at climbing stairs.
p88
aa(lp89
VOn researching this, I realized that it's because it's a continuous motion.
p90
aVThere's this other man who also suffers from the same symptoms
p91
aVand uses a walker,
p92
aVbut the moment he's put on a cycle,
p93
aVall his symptoms vanish,
p94
aVbecause it is a continuous motion.
p95
aVSo the key for me was to translate this feeling of walking on a staircase
p96
aVback to flat land.
p97
aVAnd a lot of ideas were tested and tried on him,
p98
aVbut the one that finally worked was this one. Let's take a look.
p99
aa(lp100
V(Laughter)
p101
aa(lp102
V(Applause)
p103
aa(lp104
VHe walked faster, right?
p105
aa(lp106
V(Applause)
p107
aa(lp108
VI call this the staircase illusion,
p109
aVand actually when the staircase illusion abruptly ended, he froze,
p110
aVand this is called freezing of gait.
p111
aVSo it happens a lot,
p112
aVso why not have a staircase illusion flowing through all their rooms,
p113
aVmaking them feel much more confident?
p114
aVYou know, technology is not always it.
p115
aVWhat we need are human-centered solutions.
p116
aVI could have easily made it into a projection,
p117
aVor a Google Glass, or something like that.
p118
aVBut I stuck to simple print on the floor.
p119
aVThis print could be taken into hospitals
p120
aVto make them feel much more welcome.
p121
aa(lp122
VWhat I wish to do is make every Parkinson's patient
p123
aVfeel like my uncle felt that day.
p124
aVHe told me that I made him feel like his old self again.
p125
aa(lp126
V"Smart" in today's world has become synonymous to high tech,
p127
aVand the world is only getting smarter and smarter day by day.
p128
aVBut why can't smart be something that's simple and yet effective?
p129
aVAll we need is a little bit of empathy and some curiosity,
p130
aVto go out there, observe.
p131
aVBut let's not stop at that.
p132
aVLet's find these complex problems. Don't be scared of them.
p133
aVBreak them, boil them down into much smaller problems,
p134
aVand then find simple solutions for them.
p135
aVTest these solutions, fail if needed,
p136
aVbut with newer insights to make it better.
p137
aVImagine what we all could do if we all came up with simple solutions.
p138
aVWhat would the world be like if we combined all our simple solutions?
p139
aVLet's make a smarter world, but with simplicity.
p140
aa(lp141
VThank you.
