VGood afternoon, good evening, whatever.
p4
aVWe can go, jambo, guten Abend, bonsoir,
p5
aVbut we can also ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
p6
aVThat is the call that chimpanzees make
p7
aVbefore they go to sleep in the evening.
p8
aVYou hear it going from one side of the valley to the other,
p9
aVfrom one group of nests to the next.
p10
aa(lp11
VAnd I want to pick up with my talk this evening
p12
aVfrom where Zeray left off yesterday.
p13
aVHe was talking about this amazing, three-year-old Australopithecine child, Selam.
p14
aVAnd we've also been hearing about the history, the family tree, of mankind
p15
aVthrough DNA genetic profiling.
p16
aVAnd it was a paleontologist, the late Louis Leakey,
p17
aVwho actually set me on the path for studying chimpanzees.
p18
aVAnd it was pretty extraordinary, way back then.
p19
aVIt's kind of commonplace now,
p20
aVbut his argument was \u2014 because he'd been searching
p21
aVfor the fossilized remains of early humans in Africa.
p22
aVAnd you can tell an awful lot
p23
aVabout what those beings looked like from the fossils,
p24
aVfrom the shape of the muscle attachments,
p25
aVsomething about the way they lived
p26
aVfrom the various artifacts found with them.
p27
aVBut what about how they behaved? That's what he wanted to know.
p28
aVAnd of course, behavior doesn't fossilize.
p29
aVHe argued \u2014 and it's now a fairly common theory \u2014
p30
aVthat if we found behavior patterns similar or the same
p31
aVin our closest living relatives, the great apes, and humans today,
p32
aVthen maybe those behaviors were present in the ape-like,
p33
aVhuman-like ancestor some seven million years ago.
p34
aVAnd therefore, perhaps we had brought those characteristics with us
p35
aVfrom that ancient, ancient past.
p36
aa(lp37
VWell, if you look in textbooks today that deal with human evolution,
p38
aVyou very often find people speculating about how early humans
p39
aVmay have behaved, based on the behavior of chimpanzees.
p40
aVThey are more like us than any other living creature,
p41
aVand we've heard about that during this TED Conference.
p42
aVSo it remains for me to comment on the ways in which chimpanzees
p43
aVare so like us, in certain aspects of their behavior.
p44
aa(lp45
VEvery chimpanzee has his or her own personality.
p46
aVOf course, I gave them names. They can live to be 60 years or more,
p47
aValthough we think most of them probably don't make it to 60 in the wild.
p48
aVMr. Wurzel. The female has her first baby when she's 11 or 12.
p49
aVThereafter, she has one baby only every five or six years,
p50
aVa long period of childhood dependency when the child is nursing,
p51
aVsleeping with the mother at night, and riding on her back.
p52
aVAnd we believe that this long period of childhood
p53
aVis important for chimpanzees, just as it is for us, in relation to learning.
p54
aVAs the brain becomes ever more complex
p55
aVduring evolution in different forms of animals,
p56
aVso we find that learning plays an ever more important role
p57
aVin an individual's life history.
p58
aVAnd young chimpanzees spend a lot of time watching what their elders do.
p59
aVWe know now that they're capable of imitating behaviors that they see.
p60
aVAnd we believe that it's in this way
p61
aVthat the different tool-using behaviors \u2014 that have now been seen
p62
aVin all the different chimpanzee populations studied in Africa \u2014
p63
aVhow these are passed from one generation to the next,
p64
aVthrough observation, imitation and practice,
p65
aVso that we can describe these tool-using behaviors as primitive culture.
p66
aa(lp67
VChimpanzees don't have a spoken language. We've talked about that.
p68
aVThey do have a very rich repertoire of postures and gestures,
p69
aVmany of which are similar, or even identical, to ours
p70
aVand formed in the same context. Greeting chimpanzees embracing.
p71
aVThey also kiss, hold hands, pat one another on the back.
p72
aVAnd they swagger and they throw rocks.
p73
aVIn chimpanzee society, we find many, many examples of compassion,
p74
aVprecursors to love and true altruism.
p75
aVUnfortunately, they, like us, have a dark side to their nature.
p76
aVThey're capable of extreme brutality, even a kind of primitive war.
p77
aVAnd these really aggressive behaviors, for the most part,
p78
aVare directed against individuals of the neighboring social group.
p79
aVThey are very territorially aggressive.
p80
aVChimpanzees, I believe, more than any other living creature,
p81
aVhave helped us to understand that, after all, there is no sharp line
p82
aVbetween humans and the rest of the animal kingdom.
p83
aa(lp84
VIt's a very blurry line, and it's getting more blurry all the time
p85
aVas we make even more observations.
p86
aVThe study that I began in 1960 is still continuing to this day.
p87
aVAnd these chimpanzees, living their complex social lives in the wild,
p88
aVhave helped \u2014 more than anything else \u2014
p89
aVto make us realize we are part of, and not separated from,
p90
aVthe amazing animals with whom we share the planet.
p91
aVSo it's pretty sad to find that chimpanzees,
p92
aVlike so many other creatures around the world, are losing their habitats.
p93
aVThis is just one photograph from the air,
p94
aVand it shows you the forested highlands of Gombe.
p95
aVAnd it was when I flew over the whole area, about 16 years ago,
p96
aVand realized that outside the park, this forest,
p97
aVwhich in 1960 had stretched almost unbroken
p98
aValong the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika,
p99
aVwhich is where the tiny, 30-square-mile Gombe National Park lies,
p100
aVthat a question came to my mind.
p101
aV"How can we even try to save these famous chimpanzees,
p102
aVwhen the people living around the National Park are struggling to survive?"
p103
aVMore people are living there than the land could possibly support.
p104
aVThe numbers increased by refugees pouring in from Burundi
p105
aVand over the lake from Congo.
p106
aVAnd very poor people \u2014 they couldn't afford to buy food from elsewhere.
p107
aa(lp108
VThis led to a program, which we call TACARE.
p109
aVIt's a very holistic way of improving the lives
p110
aVof the people living in the villages around the park.
p111
aVIt started small with 12 villages. It's now in 24.
p112
aVThere isn't time to go into it, but it's including things like tree nurseries,
p113
aVmethods of farming most suitable to this now very degraded,
p114
aValmost desert-like land up in these mountains.
p115
aVWays of controlling, preventing soil erosion.
p116
aVWays of reclaiming overused farmland,
p117
aVso that within two years they can again be productive.
p118
aVWorking to help the villagers obtain fresh water from wells.
p119
aVPerhaps build some schoolrooms.
p120
aVMost important of all, I believe,
p121
aVis working with small groups of women,
p122
aVproviding them with opportunities for micro-credit loans.
p123
aVAnd we've got, as is the case around the world,
p124
aVabout 95 percent of all loans returned.
p125
aVEmpowering women, working with education,
p126
aVproviding scholarships for girls so they can finish secondary school,
p127
aVin the clear understanding that, all around the world,
p128
aVas women's education improves, family size drops.
p129
aVWe provide information about family planning and about HIV/AIDS.
p130
aa(lp131
VAnd as a result of this program,
p132
aVsomething's happening for conservation.
p133
aVWhat's happening for conservation is that the farmers living in these 24 villages,
p134
aVinstead of looking on us as a bunch of white people
p135
aVcoming to study a whole bunch of monkeys \u2014
p136
aVand by the way, many of the staff are now Tanzanian \u2014
p137
aVbut when we began the TACARE program,
p138
aVit was a Tanzanian team going into the villages.
p139
aVIt was a Tanzanian team talking to the villagers,
p140
aVasking what they were interested in.
p141
aVWere they interested in conservation? Absolutely not.
p142
aVThey were interested in health; they were interested in education.
p143
aVAnd as time went on, and as their situation began to improve,
p144
aVthey began to understand ever more about the need for conservation.
p145
aVThey began to understand
p146
aVthat as the upper levels of the hills were denuded of trees,
p147
aVso you've got this terrible soil erosion and mudslides.
p148
aa(lp149
VToday, we are developing what we call the Greater Gombe Ecosystem.
p150
aVThis is an area way outside the National Park,
p151
aVstretching out into all these very degraded lands.
p152
aVAnd as these villages have a better standard of life,
p153
aVthey are actually agreeing to put
p154
aVbetween 10 percent and 20 percent of their land in the highlands aside,
p155
aVso that once again, as the trees grow back,
p156
aVthe chimpanzees will have leafy corridors
p157
aVthrough which they can travel to interact \u2014
p158
aVas they must for genetic viability \u2014
p159
aVwith other remnant groups outside the National Park.
p160
aVSo TACARE is a success.
p161
aVWe're replicating it in other parts of Africa,
p162
aVaround other wilderness areas
p163
aVwhich are faced with extreme population pressure.
p164
aa(lp165
VThe problems in Africa, however, as we've been discussing
p166
aVfor the whole of these first couple of days of TED,
p167
aVare major problems.
p168
aVThere is a great deal of poverty.
p169
aVAnd when you get large numbers of people
p170
aVliving in land that is not that fertile,
p171
aVparticularly when you cut down trees,
p172
aVand you leave the soil open to the wind for erosion,
p173
aVas desperate populations cut down more and more trees,
p174
aVso that they can try and grow food for themselves and their families,
p175
aVwhat's going to happen? Something's got to give.
p176
aVAnd the other problems \u2014 in not only Africa,
p177
aVbut the rest of the developing world and, indeed, everywhere \u2014
p178
aVwhat are we doing to our planet?
p179
aVYou know, the famous scientist, E. O. Wilson
p180
aVsaid that if every person on this planet
p181
aVattains the standard of living of the average European or American,
p182
aVwe need three new planets.
p183
aVToday, they are saying four. But we don't have them. We've got one.
p184
aa(lp185
VAnd what's happened? I mean, the question here is, here we are,
p186
aVarguably the most intelligent being that's ever walked planet Earth,
p187
aVwith this extraordinary brain,
p188
aVcapable of the kind of technology
p189
aVthat is so well illustrated by these TED Conferences,
p190
aVand yet we're destroying the only home we have.
p191
aVThe indigenous people around the world,
p192
aVbefore they made a major decision,
p193
aVused to sit around and ask themselves,
p194
aV"How does this decision affect our people seven generations ahead?"
p195
aVToday, major decisions \u2014 and I'm not particularly talking about Africa here,
p196
aVbut the developed world \u2014
p197
aVmajor decisions involving millions of dollars,
p198
aVand millions of people, are often based on,
p199
aV"How will this affect the next shareholders' meeting?"
p200
aVAnd these decisions affect Africa.
p201
aa(lp202
VAs I began traveling around Africa
p203
aVtalking about the problems faced by chimpanzees and their vanishing forests,
p204
aVI realized more and more how so many of Africa's problems
p205
aVcould be laid at the door of previous colonial exploitation.
p206
aVSo I began traveling outside Africa, talking in Europe,
p207
aVtalking in the United States, going to Asia.
p208
aVAnd everywhere there were these terrible problems.
p209
aVAnd you know the kind I'm talking about. I'm talking about pollution.
p210
aVThe air that we breathe that often poisons us.
p211
aVThe earth is poisoning our foods.
p212
aVThe water \u2014 water is perhaps one of the most crucial issues
p213
aVthat we're going to face in this century \u2014
p214
aVand everywhere water is being polluted by agricultural,
p215
aVindustrial and household chemicals
p216
aVthat still are being sprayed around the world,
p217
aVseemingly with the inability to profit from past experience.
p218
aVThe mangroves are being cut down;
p219
aVthe effects of things like the tsunami get worse.
p220
aVWe've talked about the soil erosion.
p221
aVWe have the reckless burning of fossil fuels
p222
aValong with other greenhouse gasses, so called,
p223
aVleading to climate change.
p224
aVFinally, all around the world, people have begun to believe
p225
aVthat there is something going on very wrong with our climate.
p226
aa(lp227
VAll around the world climates are mixed up.
p228
aVAnd it's the poor people who are affected worse.
p229
aVIt's Africa that already is affected.
p230
aVIn many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, the droughts are so much worse.
p231
aVAnd when the rain does come, it so often leads to flooding
p232
aVand added distress, and the cycle of poverty and hunger and disease.
p233
aVAnd the numbers of people living in an area that the land cannot support,
p234
aVwho are too poor to buy food,
p235
aVwho can't move away because the whole land is degraded.
p236
aVAnd so you get desertification \u2014 creeping, creeping, creeping \u2014
p237
aVas the last of the trees are cut down.
p238
aVAnd this kind of thing is not just in Africa. It's all over the world.
p239
aa(lp240
VSo it wasn't surprising to me
p241
aVthat as I was traveling around the world
p242
aVI met so many young people who seemed to have lost hope.
p243
aVWe seem to have lost wisdom, the wisdom of the indigenous people.
p244
aVI asked a question. "Why?"
p245
aVWell, do you think there could be some kind of disconnect
p246
aVbetween this extraordinarily clever brain,
p247
aVthe kind of brain that the TED technologies exemplify,
p248
aVand the human heart? Talking about it in the non-scientific term,
p249
aVin terms of love and compassion. Is there some disconnect?
p250
aVAnd these young people, when I talk to them,
p251
aVbasically they were either depressed or apathetic,
p252
aVor bitter and angry. And they said more or less the same thing,
p253
aV"We feel this way because we feel you've compromised our future
p254
aVand there's nothing we can do about it."
p255
aa(lp256
VWe have compromised their future.
p257
aVI've got three little grandchildren, and every time I look at them
p258
aVand I think how we've harmed this beautiful planet since I was their age,
p259
aVI feel this desperation.
p260
aVAnd that led to this program we call Roots and Shoots,
p261
aVwhich began right here in Tanzania
p262
aVand has now spread to 97 countries around the world.
p263
aVIt's symbolic. Roots make a firm foundation.
p264
aVShoots seem tiny; to reach the sun they can break through a brick wall.
p265
aVSee the brick wall as all these problems we've inflicted on the planet,
p266
aVenvironmental and social. It's a message of hope.
p267
aVHundreds and thousands of young people around the world
p268
aVcan break through and can make this a better world for all living things.
p269
aVThe most important message of Roots and Shoots:
p270
aVevery single one of us makes a difference, every single day.
p271
aVWe have a choice. Every one of us in this room,
p272
aVwe have a choice as to what kind of difference we want to make.
p273
aVThe very poor have no choice. It's up to us to change things
p274
aVso that the poor have choice as well.
p275
aa(lp276
VThe Roots and Shoots groups all choose three projects.
p277
aVIt depends on how old they are, and which country,
p278
aVwhether they're in a city or rural, as to what kinds of projects.
p279
aVBut basically, we have programs now from preschool right through university,
p280
aVwith more and more adults starting their own Roots and Shoots groups.
p281
aVAnd every group chooses, between them,
p282
aVthree different kinds of project to make this a better world,
p283
aVrecognizing that all these different problems are interconnected
p284
aVand impinge on each other.
p285
aVSo one of their projects will be to help their own human community.
p286
aVAnd then, if they're able, they may raise money to help communities
p287
aVin other parts of the world.
p288
aVOne of their projects will be to help animals \u2014 not just wildlife,
p289
aVdomestic animals as well.
p290
aVAnd one of their projects will be to help the environment that we all share.
p291
aVAnd woven throughout all of this is a message
p292
aVof learning to live in peace and harmony within ourselves,
p293
aVin our families, in our communities, between nations, between cultures,
p294
aVbetween religions and between us and the natural world.
p295
aVWe need the natural world. We cannot go on destroying it at the rate we are.
p296
aVWe not do have more than this one planet.
p297
aa(lp298
VJust picking one or two of the projects right here in Africa
p299
aVthat the Roots and Shoots groups are doing,
p300
aVone or two projects only \u2014 in Tanzania, in Uganda, Kenya,
p301
aVSouth Africa, Congo-Brazzaville, Sierra Leone, Cameroon
p302
aVand other groups. And as I say, it's in 97 countries around the world.
p303
aVOf course, they're planting trees. They're growing organic vegetables.
p304
aVThey're working in the refugee camps, with chickens
p305
aVand selling the eggs for a little amount of money,
p306
aVor just using them to feed their families,
p307
aVand feeling a sense of pride and empowerment,
p308
aVbecause they're no longer helpless and depending on others
p309
aVwith their vegetables and their chickens.
p310
aVIt's being used in Uganda
p311
aVto give some psychological help to ex-child soldiers.
p312
aVDoing projects like this is bringing them out of themselves.
p313
aVOnce again, they're useful members of society.
p314
aVWe have this program in prisons as well.
p315
aVSo, there's no time for more Roots and Shoots now.
p316
aVBut \u2014 oh, they're also working on HIV/AIDS.
p317
aVThat's a very important component of Roots and Shoots,
p318
aVwith older kids talking to younger ones.
p319
aVAnd unwanted pregnancies and things like that,
p320
aVwhich young people listen to better from other youth, rather than adults.
p321
aa(lp322
VHope. That's the question I get asked as I'm going around the world:
p323
aV"Jane, you've seen so many terrible things,
p324
aVyou've seen your chimpanzees decrease in number
p325
aVfrom about one million, at the turn of the century,
p326
aVto no more than 150,000 now, and the same with so many other animals.
p327
aVForests disappearing, deserts where once there was forest.
p328
aVDo you really have hope?" Well, yes.
p329
aVYou can't come to a conference like TED and not have hope, can you?
p330
aVAnd of course, there's hope. One is this amazing human brain.
p331
aa(lp332
VAnd I mean, think of the technologies.
p333
aVAnd I've just been so thrilled, finally, to come to people talking about compost latrines.
p334
aVIt's one of my hobbyhorses.
p335
aVWe just flush all this water down the lavatory, it's terrible.
p336
aVAnd then talking about renewable energy \u2014 desperately important.
p337
aVDo we care about the planet for our children?
p338
aVHow many of us have children or grandchildren, nieces, nephews?
p339
aVDo we care about their future?
p340
aVAnd if we care about their future, we, as the elite around the world,
p341
aVwe can do something about it. We can make choices as to how we live each day.
p342
aVWhat we buy. What we wear.
p343
aVAnd choose to make these choices with the question,
p344
aVhow will this affect the environment around me?
p345
aVHow will it affect the life of my child when he or she grows up?
p346
aVOr my grandchild, or whatever it is.
p347
aVSo the human brain, coupled with the human heart,
p348
aVand we join hands around the world.
p349
aVAnd that's what TED is helping so well with, and Google who help us,
p350
aVand Esri are helping us with mapping in Gombe National Park.
p351
aVAll of these technologies we can use.
p352
aa(lp353
VNow let's link them, and it's beginning to happen, isn't it?
p354
aVYou've heard about it this afternoon. It's beginning to happen.
p355
aVThis change, this change. To see change
p356
aVthat we must have if we care about the future.
p357
aVAnd the next reason for hope \u2014 nature is amazingly resilient.
p358
aVYou can take an area that's absolutely destroyed,
p359
aVwith time and perhaps some help it can regenerate.
p360
aVAnd an example is the TACARE program.
p361
aVI told you, where a seemingly dead tree stump \u2014
p362
aVif you stop hacking them for firewood,
p363
aVwhich you don't need to because you have wood lots,
p364
aVthen in five years you can have a 30-foot tree.
p365
aVAnd animals, almost on the brink of extinction,
p366
aVcan be given a second chance. That's my next book.
p367
aVIt's inspiring. And it brings me to my last category of hope,
p368
aVand we've heard about this so much in the last two days:
p369
aVthis indomitable human spirit. This determination of people,
p370
aVthe resilience of the human spirit,
p371
aVSo that people who you would think would be battered by poverty,
p372
aVor disease, or whatever, can pull themselves up out of it,
p373
aVsometimes with a helping hand, and take their part in society,
p374
aVand take their part in changing the world.
p375
aa(lp376
VAnd just to think of one or two people out of Africa who are just really inspiring.
p377
aVWe could make a very long list,
p378
aVbut obviously Nelson Mandela, emerging from 17 years
p379
aVof hard physical labor, 23 years of imprisonment,
p380
aVwith this amazing ability to forgive, so that he could lead his nation
p381
aVout the evil regime of apartheid without a bloodbath.
p382
aVKen Saro-Wiwa, in Nigeria, who took on the giant oil companies,
p383
aVand although people around the world tried their best, was executed.
p384
aVPeople like this are so inspirational.
p385
aVPeople like this are the role models we need for young Africans.
p386
aVAnd we need some environmental role models as well,
p387
aVand I've been hearing some of them today.
p388
aVSo I'm really grateful for this opportunity to share this message
p389
aVagain, with everyone at TED.
p390
aVAnd I hope that some of us can get together and talk about some of these things,
p391
aVespecially the Roots and Shoots program.
p392
aa(lp393
VAnd just a last word on that \u2014
p394
aVthe young woman who's running this entire conference center,
p395
aVI met her today.
p396
aVShe came up so excited, with her certificate. She was [in] Roots and Shoots.
p397
