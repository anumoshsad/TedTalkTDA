VYou might think there are many things that I can't do
p4
aVbecause I cannot see.
p5
aVThat's largely true.
p6
aVActually, I just needed to have a bit of help
p7
aVto come up to the stage.
p8
aa(lp9
VBut there is also a lot that I can do.
p10
aVThis is me rock climbing for the first time.
p11
aVActually, I love sports and I can play many sports,
p12
aVlike swimming, skiing, skating, scuba diving, running and so on.
p13
aVBut there is one limitation:
p14
aVsomebody needs to help me.
p15
aVI want to be independent.
p16
aa(lp17
VI lost my sight at the age of 14 in a swimming pool accident.
p18
aVI was an active, independent teenager,
p19
aVand suddenly I became blind.
p20
aVThe hardest thing for me was losing my independence.
p21
aVThings that until then seemed simple became almost impossible to do alone.
p22
aVFor example, one of my challenges was textbooks.
p23
aVBack then, there were no personal computers,
p24
aVno Internet, no smartphones.
p25
aVSo I had to ask one of my two brothers to read me textbooks,
p26
aVand I had to create my own books in Braille.
p27
aVCan you imagine?
p28
aVOf course, my brothers were not happy about it,
p29
aVand later, I noticed they were not there whenever I needed them.
p30
aV(Laughter)
p31
aVI think they tried to stay away from me.
p32
aVI don't blame them.
p33
aVI really wanted to be freed from relying on someone.
p34
aVThat became my strong desire to ignite innovation.
p35
aa(lp36
VJump ahead to the mid-1980s.
p37
aVI got to know cutting-edge technologies
p38
aVand I thought to myself,
p39
aVhow come there is no computer technology
p40
aVto create books in Braille?
p41
aVThese amazing technologies must be able to also help people
p42
aVwith limitations like myself.
p43
aVThat's the moment my innovation journey began.
p44
aa(lp45
VI started developing digital book technologies,
p46
aVsuch as a digital Braille editor, digital Braille dictionary
p47
aVand a digital Braille library network.
p48
aVToday, every student who is visually impaired can read textbooks,
p49
aVby using personal computers and mobile devices,
p50
aVin Braille or in voice.
p51
aVThis may not surprise you,
p52
aVsince everyone now has digital books in their tablets in 2015.
p53
aVBut Braille went digital many years before digital books,
p54
aValready in the late 1980s, almost 30 years ago.
p55
aVStrong and specific needs of the blind people
p56
aVmade this opportunity to create digital books way back then.
p57
aVAnd this is actually not the first time this happened,
p58
aVbecause history shows us accessibility ignites innovation.
p59
aVThe telephone was invented while developing a communication tool
p60
aVfor hearing impaired people.
p61
aVSome keyboards were also invented to help people with disabilities.
p62
aa(lp63
VNow I'm going to give you another example from my own life.
p64
aVIn the '90s, people around me started talking about the Internet
p65
aVand web browsing.
p66
aVI remember the first time I went on the web.
p67
aVI was astonished.
p68
aVI could access newspapers at any time and every day.
p69
aVI could even search for any information by myself.
p70
aVI desperately wanted to help the blind people have access to the Internet,
p71
aVand I found ways to render the web into synthesized voice,
p72
aVwhich dramatically simplified the user interface.
p73
aa(lp74
VThis led me to develop the Home Page Reader in 1997,
p75
aVfirst in Japanese and later, translated into 11 languages.
p76
aVWhen I developed the Home Page Reader,
p77
aVI got many comments from users.
p78
aVOne that I strongly remember said,
p79
aV"For me, the Internet is a small window to the world."
p80
aa(lp81
VIt was a revolutionary moment for the blind.
p82
aVThe cyber world became accessible,
p83
aVand this technology that we created for the blind has many uses,
p84
aVway beyond what I imagined.
p85
aVIt can help drivers listen to their emails
p86
aVor it can help you listen to a recipe while cooking.
p87
aa(lp88
VToday, I am more independent,
p89
aVbut it is still not enough.
p90
aVFor example, when I approached the stage just now, I needed assistance.
p91
aVMy goal is to come up here independently.
p92
aVAnd not just here.
p93
aVMy goal is to be able to travel and do things that are simple to you.
p94
aa(lp95
VOK, now let me show you the latest technologies.
p96
aVThis is a smartphone app that we are working on.
p97
aa(lp98
V(Video) Electronic voice: 51 feet to the door, and keep straight.
p99
aa(lp100
VEV: Take the two doors to go out. The door is on your right.
p101
aa(lp102
VEV: Nick is approaching. Looks so happy.
p103
aVChieko Asakawa: Hi, Nick!
p104
aa(lp105
V(Laughter)
p106
aVCA: Where are you going? You look so happy.
p107
aa(lp108
VNick: Oh \u2014 well, my paper just got accepted.
p109
aVCA: That's great! Congratulations.
p110
aa(lp111
VNick: Thanks. Wait \u2014 how'd you know it was me, and that I look happy?
p112
aV(Chieko and Nick laugh)
p113
aa(lp114
VMan: Hi.
p115
aV(Laughter)
p116
aVCA: Oh ... hi.
p117
aa(lp118
VEV: He is not talking to you, but on his phone.
p119
aa(lp120
VEV: Potato chips.
p121
aa(lp122
VEV: Dark chocolate with almonds.
p123
aa(lp124
VEV: You gained 5 pounds since yesterday; take apple instead of chocolate.
p125
aa(lp126
V(Laughter)
p127
aa(lp128
VEV: Approaching.
p129
aa(lp130
VEV: You arrived.
p131
aa(lp132
VCA: Now ...
p133
aa(lp134
V(Applause)
p135
aa(lp136
VThank you.
p137
aa(lp138
VSo now the app navigates me
p139
aVby analyzing beacon signals and smartphone sensors
p140
aVand permits me to move around indoor and outdoor environments
p141
aVall by myself.
p142
aVBut the computer vision part that showed who is approaching,
p143
aVin which mood \u2014 we are still working on that part.
p144
aVAnd recognizing facial expressions is very important for me to be social.
p145
aa(lp146
VSo now the fusions of technologies are ready to help me
p147
aVsee the real world.
p148
aVWe call this cognitive assistance.
p149
aVIt understands our surrounding world
p150
aVand whispers to me in voice or sends a vibration to my fingers.
p151
aVCognitive assistance will augment missing or weakened abilities \u2014
p152
aVin other words, our five senses.
p153
aVThis technology is only in an early stage,
p154
aVbut eventually, I'll be able to find a classroom on campus,
p155
aVenjoy window shopping
p156
aVor find a nice restaurant while walking along a street.
p157
aVIt will be amazing if I can find you on the street before you notice me.
p158
aVIt will become my best buddy, and yours.
p159
aa(lp160
VSo, this really is a great challenge.
p161
aVIt is a challenge that needs collaboration,
p162
aVwhich is why we are creating an open community
p163
aVto accelerate research activities.
p164
aVJust this morning, we announced the open-source fundamental technologies
p165
aVyou just saw in the video.
p166
aa(lp167
VThe frontier is the real world.
p168
aVThe blind community is exploring this technical frontier
p169
aVand the pathfinder.
p170
aVI hope to work with you to explore the new era,
p171
aVand the next time that I'm on this stage,
p172
aVthrough technology and innovation,
p173
aVI will be able to walk up here
p174
aVall by myself.
p175
aa(lp176
VThank you so much.
