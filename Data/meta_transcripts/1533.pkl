VIn Oxford in the 1950s,
p4
aVthere was a fantastic doctor, who was very unusual,
p5
aVnamed Alice Stewart.
p6
aVAnd Alice was unusual partly because, of course,
p7
aVshe was a woman, which was pretty rare in the 1950s.
p8
aVAnd she was brilliant, she was one of the,
p9
aVat the time, the youngest Fellow to be elected to the Royal College of Physicians.
p10
aVShe was unusual too because she continued to work after she got married,
p11
aVafter she had kids,
p12
aVand even after she got divorced and was a single parent,
p13
aVshe continued her medical work.
p14
aa(lp15
VAnd she was unusual because she was really interested in a new science,
p16
aVthe emerging field of epidemiology,
p17
aVthe study of patterns in disease.
p18
aVBut like every scientist, she appreciated
p19
aVthat to make her mark, what she needed to do
p20
aVwas find a hard problem and solve it.
p21
aVThe hard problem that Alice chose
p22
aVwas the rising incidence of childhood cancers.
p23
aVMost disease is correlated with poverty,
p24
aVbut in the case of childhood cancers,
p25
aVthe children who were dying seemed mostly to come
p26
aVfrom affluent families.
p27
aVSo, what, she wanted to know,
p28
aVcould explain this anomaly?
p29
aa(lp30
VNow, Alice had trouble getting funding for her research.
p31
aVIn the end, she got just 1,000 pounds
p32
aVfrom the Lady Tata Memorial prize.
p33
aVAnd that meant she knew she only had one shot
p34
aVat collecting her data.
p35
aVNow, she had no idea what to look for.
p36
aVThis really was a needle in a haystack sort of search,
p37
aVso she asked everything she could think of.
p38
aVHad the children eaten boiled sweets?
p39
aVHad they consumed colored drinks?
p40
aVDid they eat fish and chips?
p41
aVDid they have indoor or outdoor plumbing?
p42
aVWhat time of life had they started school?
p43
aa(lp44
VAnd when her carbon copied questionnaire started to come back,
p45
aVone thing and one thing only jumped out
p46
aVwith the statistical clarity of a kind that
p47
aVmost scientists can only dream of.
p48
aVBy a rate of two to one,
p49
aVthe children who had died
p50
aVhad had mothers who had been X-rayed when pregnant.
p51
aVNow that finding flew in the face of conventional wisdom.
p52
aVConventional wisdom held
p53
aVthat everything was safe up to a point, a threshold.
p54
aVIt flew in the face of conventional wisdom,
p55
aVwhich was huge enthusiasm for the cool new technology
p56
aVof that age, which was the X-ray machine.
p57
aVAnd it flew in the face of doctors' idea of themselves,
p58
aVwhich was as people who helped patients,
p59
aVthey didn't harm them.
p60
aa(lp61
VNevertheless, Alice Stewart rushed to publish
p62
aVher preliminary findings in The Lancet in 1956.
p63
aVPeople got very excited, there was talk of the Nobel Prize,
p64
aVand Alice really was in a big hurry
p65
aVto try to study all the cases of childhood cancer she could find
p66
aVbefore they disappeared.
p67
aVIn fact, she need not have hurried.
p68
aVIt was fully 25 years before the British and medical \u2014
p69
aVBritish and American medical establishments
p70
aVabandoned the practice of X-raying pregnant women.
p71
aVThe data was out there, it was open, it was freely available,
p72
aVbut nobody wanted to know.
p73
aVA child a week was dying,
p74
aVbut nothing changed.
p75
aVOpenness alone can't drive change.
p76
aa(lp77
VSo for 25 years Alice Stewart had a very big fight on her hands.
p78
aVSo, how did she know that she was right?
p79
aVWell, she had a fantastic model for thinking.
p80
aVShe worked with a statistician named George Kneale,
p81
aVand George was pretty much everything that Alice wasn't.
p82
aVSo, Alice was very outgoing and sociable,
p83
aVand George was a recluse.
p84
aVAlice was very warm, very empathetic with her patients.
p85
aVGeorge frankly preferred numbers to people.
p86
aVBut he said this fantastic thing about their working relationship.
p87
aVHe said, "My job is to prove Dr. Stewart wrong."
p88
aVHe actively sought disconfirmation.
p89
aVDifferent ways of looking at her models,
p90
aVat her statistics, different ways of crunching the data
p91
aVin order to disprove her.
p92
aVHe saw his job as creating conflict around her theories.
p93
aVBecause it was only by not being able to prove
p94
aVthat she was wrong,
p95
aVthat George could give Alice the confidence she needed
p96
aVto know that she was right.
p97
aa(lp98
VIt's a fantastic model of collaboration \u2014
p99
aVthinking partners who aren't echo chambers.
p100
aVI wonder how many of us have,
p101
aVor dare to have, such collaborators.
p102
aVAlice and George were very good at conflict.
p103
aVThey saw it as thinking.
p104
aa(lp105
VSo what does that kind of constructive conflict require?
p106
aVWell, first of all, it requires that we find people
p107
aVwho are very different from ourselves.
p108
aVThat means we have to resist the neurobiological drive,
p109
aVwhich means that we really prefer people mostly like ourselves,
p110
aVand it means we have to seek out people
p111
aVwith different backgrounds, different disciplines,
p112
aVdifferent ways of thinking and different experience,
p113
aVand find ways to engage with them.
p114
aVThat requires a lot of patience and a lot of energy.
p115
aa(lp116
VAnd the more I've thought about this,
p117
aVthe more I think, really, that that's a kind of love.
p118
aVBecause you simply won't commit that kind of energy
p119
aVand time if you don't really care.
p120
aVAnd it also means that we have to be prepared to change our minds.
p121
aVAlice's daughter told me
p122
aVthat every time Alice went head-to-head with a fellow scientist,
p123
aVthey made her think and think and think again.
p124
aV"My mother," she said, "My mother didn't enjoy a fight,
p125
aVbut she was really good at them."
p126
aa(lp127
VSo it's one thing to do that in a one-to-one relationship.
p128
aVBut it strikes me that the biggest problems we face,
p129
aVmany of the biggest disasters that we've experienced,
p130
aVmostly haven't come from individuals,
p131
aVthey've come from organizations,
p132
aVsome of them bigger than countries,
p133
aVmany of them capable of affecting hundreds,
p134
aVthousands, even millions of lives.
p135
aVSo how do organizations think?
p136
aVWell, for the most part, they don't.
p137
aVAnd that isn't because they don't want to,
p138
aVit's really because they can't.
p139
aVAnd they can't because the people inside of them
p140
aVare too afraid of conflict.
p141
aa(lp142
VIn surveys of European and American executives,
p143
aVfully 85 percent of them acknowledged
p144
aVthat they had issues or concerns at work
p145
aVthat they were afraid to raise.
p146
aVAfraid of the conflict that that would provoke,
p147
aVafraid to get embroiled in arguments
p148
aVthat they did not know how to manage,
p149
aVand felt that they were bound to lose.
p150
aVEighty-five percent is a really big number.
p151
aVIt means that organizations mostly can't do
p152
aVwhat George and Alice so triumphantly did.
p153
aVThey can't think together.
p154
aVAnd it means that people like many of us,
p155
aVwho have run organizations,
p156
aVand gone out of our way to try to find the very best people we can,
p157
aVmostly fail to get the best out of them.
p158
aa(lp159
VSo how do we develop the skills that we need?
p160
aVBecause it does take skill and practice, too.
p161
aVIf we aren't going to be afraid of conflict,
p162
aVwe have to see it as thinking,
p163
aVand then we have to get really good at it.
p164
aVSo, recently, I worked with an executive named Joe,
p165
aVand Joe worked for a medical device company.
p166
aVAnd Joe was very worried about the device that he was working on.
p167
aVHe thought that it was too complicated
p168
aVand he thought that its complexity
p169
aVcreated margins of error that could really hurt people.
p170
aVHe was afraid of doing damage to the patients he was trying to help.
p171
aVBut when he looked around his organization,
p172
aVnobody else seemed to be at all worried.
p173
aVSo, he didn't really want to say anything.
p174
aVAfter all, maybe they knew something he didn't.
p175
aVMaybe he'd look stupid.
p176
aVBut he kept worrying about it,
p177
aVand he worried about it so much that he got to the point
p178
aVwhere he thought the only thing he could do
p179
aVwas leave a job he loved.
p180
aa(lp181
VIn the end, Joe and I found a way
p182
aVfor him to raise his concerns.
p183
aVAnd what happened then is what almost always
p184
aVhappens in this situation.
p185
aVIt turned out everybody had exactly the same
p186
aVquestions and doubts.
p187
aVSo now Joe had allies. They could think together.
p188
aVAnd yes, there was a lot of conflict and debate
p189
aVand argument, but that allowed everyone around the table
p190
aVto be creative, to solve the problem,
p191
aVand to change the device.
p192
aa(lp193
VJoe was what a lot of people might think of
p194
aVas a whistle-blower,
p195
aVexcept that like almost all whistle-blowers,
p196
aVhe wasn't a crank at all,
p197
aVhe was passionately devoted to the organization
p198
aVand the higher purposes that that organization served.
p199
aVBut he had been so afraid of conflict,
p200
aVuntil finally he became more afraid of the silence.
p201
aVAnd when he dared to speak,
p202
aVhe discovered much more inside himself
p203
aVand much more give in the system than he had ever imagined.
p204
aVAnd his colleagues don't think of him as a crank.
p205
aVThey think of him as a leader.
p206
aa(lp207
VSo, how do we have these conversations more easily
p208
aVand more often?
p209
aVWell, the University of Delft
p210
aVrequires that its PhD students
p211
aVhave to submit five statements that they're prepared to defend.
p212
aVIt doesn't really matter what the statements are about,
p213
aVwhat matters is that the candidates are willing and able
p214
aVto stand up to authority.
p215
aVI think it's a fantastic system,
p216
aVbut I think leaving it to PhD candidates
p217
aVis far too few people, and way too late in life.
p218
aVI think we need to be teaching these skills
p219
aVto kids and adults at every stage of their development,
p220
aVif we want to have thinking organizations
p221
aVand a thinking society.
p222
aa(lp223
VThe fact is that most of the biggest catastrophes that we've witnessed
p224
aVrarely come from information that is secret or hidden.
p225
aVIt comes from information that is freely available and out there,
p226
aVbut that we are willfully blind to,
p227
aVbecause we can't handle, don't want to handle,
p228
aVthe conflict that it provokes.
p229
aVBut when we dare to break that silence,
p230
aVor when we dare to see,
p231
aVand we create conflict,
p232
aVwe enable ourselves and the people around us
p233
aVto do our very best thinking.
p234
aa(lp235
VOpen information is fantastic,
p236
aVopen networks are essential.
p237
aVBut the truth won't set us free
p238
aVuntil we develop the skills and the habit and the talent
p239
aVand the moral courage to use it.
p240
aVOpenness isn't the end.
p241
aVIt's the beginning.
