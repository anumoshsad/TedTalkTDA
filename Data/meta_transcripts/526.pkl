VThis machine, which we all have residing in our skulls,
p4
aVreminds me of an aphorism, of a
p5
aVcomment of Woody Allen
p6
aVto ask about what is the very best thing to have within your skull.
p7
aVAnd it's this machine.
p8
aVAnd it's constructed for change. It's all about change.
p9
aVIt confers on us the ability to do things tomorrow that we can't do today,
p10
aVthings today that we couldn't do yesterday.
p11
aVAnd of course it's born stupid.
p12
aa(lp13
VThe last time you were in the presence of a baby \u2014
p14
aVthis happens to be my granddaughter, Mitra.
p15
aVIsn't she fabulous?
p16
aV(Laughter)
p17
aVBut nonetheless when she popped out
p18
aVdespite the fact that her brain had actually been progressing
p19
aVin its development for several months before
p20
aVon the basis of her experiences in the womb \u2014
p21
aVnonetheless she had very limited abilities,
p22
aVas does every infant
p23
aVat the time of normal, natural full-term birth.
p24
aVIf we were to assay her perceptual abilities, they would be crude.
p25
aVThere is no real indication that there is any real thinking going on.
p26
aVIn fact there is little evidence that there is any
p27
aVcognitive ability in a very young infant.
p28
aVInfants don't respond to much.
p29
aVThere is not really much of an indication in fact that there is a person on board.
p30
aV(Laughter)
p31
aVAnd they can only in a very primitive way, and in a very limited way
p32
aVcontrol their movements.
p33
aa(lp34
VIt would be several months before this infant
p35
aVcould do something as simple as reach out and grasp
p36
aVunder voluntary control an object and retrieve it,
p37
aVusually to the mouth.
p38
aVAnd it will be some months beforeward,
p39
aVand we see a long steady progression
p40
aVof the evolution from the first wiggles,
p41
aVto rolling over, and sitting up, and crawling,
p42
aVstanding, walking,
p43
aVbefore we get to that magical point
p44
aVin which we can motate in the world.
p45
aVAnd yet, when we look forward in the brain
p46
aVwe see really remarkable advance.
p47
aVBy this age the brain can actually store.
p48
aVIt has stored, recorded,
p49
aVcan fastly retrieve
p50
aVthe meanings of thousands,
p51
aVtens of thousands of objects,
p52
aVactions, and their relationships in the world.
p53
aVAnd those relationships can in fact be constructed in hundreds of thousands,
p54
aVpotentially millions of ways.
p55
aVBy this age the brain controls very refined perceptual abilities.
p56
aVAnd it actually has a growing repertoire of cognitive skills.
p57
aVThis brain is very much a thinking machine.
p58
aVAnd by this age there is absolutely no question
p59
aVthat this brain, it has a person on board.
p60
aVAnd in fact at this age it is substantially controlling its own self-development.
p61
aVAnd by this age we see a remarkable evolution
p62
aVin its capacity to control movement.
p63
aa(lp64
VNow movement has advanced to the point
p65
aVwhere it can actually control movement simultaneously,
p66
aVin a complex sequence, in complex ways
p67
aVas would be required for example
p68
aVfor playing a complicated game,
p69
aVlike soccer.
p70
aVNow this boy can bounce a soccer ball on his head.
p71
aVAnd where this boy comes from, Sao Paulo, Brazil,
p72
aVabout 40 percent of boys of his age have this ability.
p73
aVYou could go out into the community in Monterey,
p74
aVand you'd have difficulty finding a boy that has this ability.
p75
aVAnd if you did he'd probably be from Sao Paulo.
p76
aV(Laughter)
p77
aa(lp78
VThat's all another way of saying
p79
aVthat our individual skills and abilities
p80
aVare very much shaped by our environments.
p81
aVThat environment extends into our contemporary culture,
p82
aVthe thing our brain is challenged with.
p83
aVBecause what we've done in our personal evolutions
p84
aVis build up a large repertoire of specific skills and abilities
p85
aVthat are specific to our own individual histories.
p86
aVAnd in fact they result in a wonderful
p87
aVdifferentiation in humankind,
p88
aVin the way that, in fact, no two of us
p89
aVare quite alike.
p90
aVEvery one of us has a different set of acquired skills and abilities
p91
aVthat all derive out of the plasticity,
p92
aVthe adaptability of this really remarkable adaptive machine.
p93
aVIn an adult brain of course we've built up
p94
aVa large repertoire of mastered skills and abilities
p95
aVthat we can perform more or less automatically from memory,
p96
aVand that define us as acting, moving, thinking creatures.
p97
aa(lp98
VNow we study this,
p99
aVas the nerdy, laboratory, university-based scientists that we are,
p100
aVby engaging the brains
p101
aVof animals like rats, or monkeys,
p102
aVor of this particularly curious creature \u2014
p103
aVone of the more bizarre forms of life on earth \u2014
p104
aVto engage them in learning new skills and abilities.
p105
aVAnd we try to track the changes that occur
p106
aVas the new skill or ability is acquired.
p107
aVIn fact we do this in individuals
p108
aVof any age, in these different species \u2014
p109
aVthat is to say from infancies,
p110
aVinfancy up to adulthood and old age.
p111
aVSo we might engage a rat, for example,
p112
aVto acquire a new skill or ability
p113
aVthat might involve the rat using its paw
p114
aVto master particular manual grasp behaviors
p115
aVjust like we might examine a child
p116
aVand their ability to acquire the sub-skills,
p117
aVor the general overall skill of accomplishing something
p118
aVlike mastering the ability to read.
p119
aVOr you might look in an older individual
p120
aVwho has mastered a complex set of abilities
p121
aVthat might relate to reading musical notation
p122
aVor performing the mechanical acts of performance
p123
aVthat apply to musical performance.
p124
aa(lp125
VFrom these studies we defined two great epochs
p126
aVof the plastic history of the brain.
p127
aVThe first great epoch is commonly called the "Critical Period."
p128
aVAnd that is the period in which the brain is setting up
p129
aVin its initial form its basic processing machinery.
p130
aVThis is actually a period of dramatic change
p131
aVin which it doesn't take learning, per se, to drive
p132
aVthe initial differentiation of the machinery of the brain.
p133
aVAll it takes for example in the sound domain,
p134
aVis exposure to sound.
p135
aVAnd the brain actually is at the mercy
p136
aVof the sound environment in which it is reared.
p137
aVSo for example I can rear an animal
p138
aVin an environment in which there is meaningless dumb sound,
p139
aVa repertoire of sound that I make up,
p140
aVthat I make, just by exposure, artificially important
p141
aVto the animal and its young brain.
p142
aVAnd what I see is that the animal's brain sets up
p143
aVits initial processing of that sound
p144
aVin a form that's idealized, within the limits of its processing achievements
p145
aVto represent it in an organized and orderly way.
p146
aVThe sound doesn't have to be valuable to the animal:
p147
aVI could raise the animal in something that could be hypothetically valuable,
p148
aVlike the sounds that simulate
p149
aVthe sounds of a native language of a child.
p150
aVAnd I see the brain actually develop a processor that is specialized \u2014
p151
aVspecialized for that complex array, a repertoire of sounds.
p152
aVIt actually exaggerates their separateness of representation,
p153
aVin multi-dimensional neuronal representational terms.
p154
aa(lp155
VOr I can expose the animal to a completely meaningless and destructive sound.
p156
aVI can raise an animal under conditions
p157
aVthat would be equivalent to raising a baby
p158
aVunder a moderately loud ceiling fan,
p159
aVin the presence of continuous noise.
p160
aVAnd when I do that I actually specialize the brain
p161
aVto be a master processor for that meaningless sound.
p162
aVAnd I frustrate its ability
p163
aVto represent any meaningful sound as a consequence.
p164
aVSuch things in the early history of babies
p165
aVoccur in real babies.
p166
aVAnd they account for, for example
p167
aVthe beautiful evolution of a language-specific processor
p168
aVin every normally developing baby.
p169
aVAnd so they also account for
p170
aVdevelopment of defective processing
p171
aVin a substantial population of children
p172
aVwho are more limited, as a consequence,
p173
aVin their language abilities at an older age.
p174
aa(lp175
VNow in this early period of plasticity
p176
aVthe brain actually changes outside of a learning context.
p177
aVI don't have to be paying attention to what I hear.
p178
aVThe input doesn't really have to be meaningful.
p179
aVI don't have to be in a behavioral context.
p180
aVThis is required so the brain sets up it's processing
p181
aVso that it can act differentially,
p182
aVso that it can act selectively,
p183
aVso that the creature that wears it, that carries it,
p184
aVcan begin to operate on it in a selective way.
p185
aVIn the next great epoch of life, which applies for most of life,
p186
aVthe brain is actually refining its machinery
p187
aVas it masters a wide repertoire of skills and abilities.
p188
aVAnd in this epoch,
p189
aVwhich extends from late in the first year of life to death;
p190
aVit's actually doing this under behavioral control.
p191
aVAnd that's another way of saying
p192
aVthe brain has strategies that define
p193
aVthe significance of the input to the brain.
p194
aVAnd it's focusing on skill after skill,
p195
aVor ability after ability,
p196
aVunder specific attentional control.
p197
aVIt's a function of whether a goal in a behavior is achieved
p198
aVor whether the individual is rewarded in the behavior.
p199
aVThis is actually very powerful.
p200
aVThis lifelong capacity for plasticity, for brain change,
p201
aVis powerfully expressed.
p202
aVIt is the basis of our real differentiation,
p203
aVone individual from another.
p204
aVYou can look down in the brain of an animal
p205
aVthat's engaged in a specific skill,
p206
aVand you can witness or document this change on a variety of levels.
p207
aa(lp208
VSo here is a very simple experiment.
p209
aVIt was actually conducted about five years ago
p210
aVin collaboration with scientists from the University of Provence
p211
aVin Marseilles.
p212
aVIt's a very simple experiment where a monkey has been trained
p213
aVin a task that involves it manipulating a tool
p214
aVthat's equivalent in its difficulty
p215
aVto a child learning to manipulate or handle a spoon.
p216
aVThe monkey actually mastered the task
p217
aVin about 700 practice tries.
p218
aVSo in the beginning the monkey could not perform this task at all.
p219
aVIt had a success rate of about one in eight tries.
p220
aVThose tries were elaborate.
p221
aVEach attempt was substantially different from the other.
p222
aVBut the monkey gradually developed a strategy.
p223
aVAnd 700 or so tries later
p224
aVthe monkey is performing it flawlessly \u2014 never fails.
p225
aVHe's successful in his retrieval of food with this tool every time.
p226
aVAt this point the task is being performed
p227
aVin a beautifully stereotyped way:
p228
aVvery beautifully regulated and highly repeated, trial to trial.
p229
aa(lp230
VWe can look down in the brain of the monkey.
p231
aVAnd we see that it's distorted.
p232
aVWe can track these changes, and have tracked these changes
p233
aVin many such behaviors across time.
p234
aVAnd here we see the distortion
p235
aVreflected in the map of the skin surfaces of the hand of the monkey.
p236
aVNow this is a map, down in the surface of the brain,
p237
aVin which, in a very elaborate experiment we've reconstructed the responses,
p238
aVlocation by location,
p239
aVin a highly detailed response mapping of the responses of its neurons.
p240
aVWe see here a reconstruction of how
p241
aVthe hand is represented in the brain.
p242
aVWe've actually distorted the map by the exercise.
p243
aVAnd that is indicated in the pink. We have a couple fingertip surfaces that are larger.
p244
aVThese are the surfaces the monkey is using to manipulate the tool.
p245
aVIf we look at the selectivity of responses
p246
aVin the cortex of the monkey,
p247
aVwe see that the monkey has actually changed the filter characteristics
p248
aVwhich represents input from the skin
p249
aVof the fingertips that are engaged.
p250
aVIn other words there is still a single, simple representation of the fingertips
p251
aVin this most organized of cortical areas
p252
aVof the surface of the skin of the body.
p253
aVMonkey has like you have.
p254
aVAnd yet now it's represented in substantially finer grain.
p255
aVThe monkey is getting more detailed information from these surfaces.
p256
aVAnd that is an unknown \u2014 unsuspected, maybe, by you \u2014
p257
aVpart of acquiring the skill or ability.
p258
aa(lp259
VNow actually we've looked in several different cortical areas
p260
aVin the monkey learning this task.
p261
aVAnd each one of them changes in ways that are specific
p262
aVto the skill or ability.
p263
aVSo for example we can look to the cortical area
p264
aVthat represents input that's controlling the posture of the monkey.
p265
aVWe look in cortical areas that control specific movements,
p266
aVand the sequences of movements
p267
aVthat are required in the behavior, and so forth.
p268
aVThey are all remodeled. They all become specialized for the task at hand.
p269
aVThere are 15 or 20 cortical areas that are changed specifically
p270
aVwhen you learn a simple skill like this.
p271
aVAnd that represents in your brain, really massive change.
p272
aVIt represents the change in a reliable way
p273
aVof the responses of tens of millions,
p274
aVpossibly hundreds of millions of neurons in your brain.
p275
aVIt represents changes
p276
aVof hundreds of millions, possibly billions
p277
aVof synaptic connections in your brain.
p278
aVThis is constructed by physical change.
p279
aVAnd the level of construction that occurs is massive.
p280
aVThink about the changes that occur in the brain of a child
p281
aVthrough the course of acquiring their movement behavior abilities in general.
p282
aVOr acquiring their native language abilities.
p283
aVThe changes are massive.
p284
aa(lp285
VWhat it's all about is the selective representations
p286
aVof things that are important to the brain.
p287
aVBecause in most of the life of the brain
p288
aVthis is under control of behavioral context.
p289
aVIt's what you pay attention to.
p290
aVIt's what's rewarding to you.
p291
aVIt's what the brain regards, itself,
p292
aVas positive and important to you.
p293
aVIt's all about cortical processing
p294
aVand forebrain specialization.
p295
aVAnd that underlies your specialization.
p296
aVThat is why you, in your many skills and abilities,
p297
aVare a unique specialist:
p298
aVa specialist that's vastly different
p299
aVin your physical brain in detail
p300
aVthan the brain of an individual 100 years ago;
p301
aVenormously different in the details
p302
aVfrom the brain of the average individual 1,000 years ago.
p303
aVNow, one of the characteristics of this change process
p304
aVis that information is always related
p305
aVto other inputs or information that is occurring
p306
aVin immediate time, in context.
p307
aVAnd that's because the brain is constructing representations of things
p308
aVthat are correlated in little moments of time
p309
aVand that relate to one another in little moments of successive time.
p310
aVThe brain is recording all information
p311
aVand driving all change
p312
aVin temporal context.
p313
aVNow overwhelmingly the most powerful context
p314
aVthat's occurred in your brain is you.
p315
aVBillions of events have occurred in your history
p316
aVthat are related in time to yourself
p317
aVas the receiver,
p318
aVor yourself as the actor, yourself as the thinker,
p319
aVyourself as the mover.
p320
aVBillions of times little pieces of sensation have come in
p321
aVfrom the surface of your body
p322
aVthat are always associated with you as the receiver,
p323
aVand that result in
p324
aVthe embodiment of you.
p325
aVYou are constructed, your self is constructed
p326
aVfrom these billions of events.
p327
aVIt's constructed. It's created in your brain.
p328
aVAnd it's created in the brain via physical change.
p329
aVThis is a marvelously constructed thing
p330
aVthat results in individual form
p331
aVbecause each one of us has vastly different histories,
p332
aVand vastly different experiences,
p333
aVthat drive in to us this marvelous differentiation of self,
p334
aVof personhood.
p335
aa(lp336
VNow we've used this research
p337
aVto try to understand not just how a normal person develops,
p338
aVand elaborates their skills and abilities,
p339
aVbut also try to understand
p340
aVthe origins of impairment,
p341
aVand the origins of differences or variations
p342
aVthat might limit the capacities of a child, or an adult.
p343
aVI'm going to talk about using these strategies
p344
aVto actually design brain plasticity-based
p345
aVapproach to drive corrections in the machinery of a child
p346
aVthat increases the competence of the child
p347
aVas a language receiver and user
p348
aVand, thereafter, as a reader.
p349
aVAnd I'm going to talk about experiments that involve
p350
aVactually using this brain science,
p351
aVfirst of all to understand how it contributes to the loss of function as we age.
p352
aVAnd then, by using it in a targeted approach
p353
aVwe're going to try to differentiate
p354
aVthe machinery to recover function in old age.
p355
aa(lp356
VSo the first example I'm going to talk about
p357
aVrelates to children with learning impairments.
p358
aVWe now have a large body of literature
p359
aVthat demonstrates that the fundamental
p360
aVproblem that occurs in the majority of children
p361
aVthat have early language impairments,
p362
aVand that are going to struggle to learn to read,
p363
aVis that their language processor
p364
aVis created in a defective form.
p365
aVAnd the reason that it rises in a defective form
p366
aVis because early in the baby's brain's life
p367
aVthe machine process is noisy.
p368
aVIt's that simple.
p369
aVIt's a signal-to-noise problem. Okay?
p370
aVAnd there are a lot of things that contribute to that.
p371
aVThere are numerous inherited faults
p372
aVthat could make the machine process noisier.
p373
aVNow I might say the noise problem could also occur
p374
aVon the basis of information provided
p375
aVin the world from the ears.
p376
aa(lp377
VIf any \u2014 those of you who are older in the audience know
p378
aVthat when I was a child we understood that a child born with a cleft palate
p379
aVwas born with what we called mental retardation.
p380
aVWe knew that they were going to be slow cognitively;
p381
aVwe knew they were going to struggle to learn to develop normal language abilities;
p382
aVand we knew that they were going to struggle to learn to read.
p383
aVMost of them would be intellectual and academic failures.
p384
aVThat's disappeared. That no longer applies.
p385
aVThat inherited weakness, that inherited condition
p386
aVhas evaporated.
p387
aVWe don't hear about that anymore. Where did it go?
p388
aVWell, it was understood by a Dutch surgeon,
p389
aVabout 35 years ago,
p390
aVthat if you simply fix the problem early enough,
p391
aVwhen the brain is still in this initial plastic period
p392
aVso it can set up this machinery adequately,
p393
aVin this initial set up time in the critical period,
p394
aVnone of that happens.
p395
aVWhat are you doing by operating on the cleft palate to correct it?
p396
aVYou're basically opening up
p397
aVthe tubes that drain fluid from the middle ears,
p398
aVwhich have had them reliably full.
p399
aVEvery sound the child hears uncorrected is muffled.
p400
aVIt's degraded.
p401
aVThe child's native language is such a case is not English.
p402
aVIt's not Japanese.
p403
aVIt's muffled English. It's degraded Japanese.
p404
aVIt's crap.
p405
aVAnd the brain specializes for it.
p406
aVIt creates a representation of language crap.
p407
aVAnd then the child is stuck with it.
p408
aa(lp409
VNow the crap doesn't just happen in the ear.
p410
aVIt can also happen in the brain.
p411
aVThe brain itself can be noisy. It's commonly noisy.
p412
aVThere are many inherited faults that can make it noisier.
p413
aVAnd the native language for a child with such a brain
p414
aVis degraded.
p415
aVIt's not English. It's noisy English.
p416
aVAnd that results in defective representations of sounds of words \u2014
p417
aVnot normal \u2014 a different strategy,
p418
aVby a machine that has different time constants and different space constants.
p419
aVAnd you can look in the brain of such a child and record those time constants.
p420
aVThey are about an order of magnitude longer,
p421
aVabout 11 times longer in duration on average,
p422
aVthan in a normal child.
p423
aVSpace constants are about three times greater.
p424
aVSuch a child will have memory and cognitive deficits
p425
aVin this domain.
p426
aVOf course they will. Because as a receiver of language,
p427
aVthey are receiving it and representing it,
p428
aVand in information it's representing crap.
p429
aVAnd they are going to have poor reading skills.
p430
aVBecause reading is dependent upon the translation of word sounds
p431
aVinto this orthographic or visual
p432
aVrepresentational form.
p433
aVIf you don't have a brain representation of word sounds
p434
aVthat translation makes no sense.
p435
aVAnd you are going to have corresponding abnormal neurology.
p436
aa(lp437
VThen these children increasingly
p438
aVin evaluation after evaluation,
p439
aVin their operations in language, and their operations in reading \u2014
p440
aVwe document that abnormal neurology.
p441
aVThe point is is that you can train the brain out of this.
p442
aVA way to think about this is you can actually re-refine
p443
aVthe processing capacity of the machinery
p444
aVby changing it.
p445
aVChanging it in detail. It takes about 30 hours on the average.
p446
aVAnd we've accomplished that in about 430,000 kids today.
p447
aVActually, probably about 15,000 children are being trained as we speak.
p448
aVAnd actually when you look at the impacts, the impacts are substantial.
p449
aa(lp450
VSo here we're looking at the normal distribution.
p451
aVWhat we're most interested in is these kids on the left side of the distribution.
p452
aVThis is from about 3,000 children.
p453
aVYou can see that most of the children on the left side of the distribution
p454
aVare moving into the middle or the right.
p455
aVThis is in a broad assessment of their language abilities.
p456
aVThis is like an IQ test for language.
p457
aVThe impact in the distribution, if you trained every child
p458
aVin the United States, would be to shift the whole distribution to the right
p459
aVand narrow the distribution.
p460
aVThis is a substantially large impact.
p461
aa(lp462
VThink of a classroom of children in the language arts.
p463
aVThink of the children on the slow side of the class.
p464
aVWe have the potential to move most of those children
p465
aVto the middle or to the right side.
p466
aVIn addition to accurate language training
p467
aVit also fixes memory and cognition
p468
aVspeech fluency and speech production.
p469
aVAnd an important language dependent skill is enabled by this training \u2014
p470
aVthat is to say reading.
p471
aVAnd to a large extent it fixes the brain.
p472
aVYou can look down in the brain of a child
p473
aVin a variety of tasks that scientists have at Stanford,
p474
aVand MIT, and UCSF, and UCLA, and a number of other institutions.
p475
aVAnd children operating in various language behaviors,
p476
aVor in various reading behaviors,
p477
aVyou see for the most extent,
p478
aVfor most children, their neuronal responses,
p479
aVcomplexly abnormal before you start,
p480
aVare normalized by the training.
p481
aa(lp482
VNow you can also take the same approach
p483
aVto address problems in aging.
p484
aVWhere again the machinery is deteriorating now
p485
aVfrom competent machinery, it's going south.
p486
aVNoise is increasing in the brain.
p487
aVAnd learning modulation and control is deteriorating.
p488
aVAnd you can actually look down on the brain of such an individual
p489
aVand witness a change in the time constants and space constants
p490
aVwith which, for example, the brain is representing language again.
p491
aVJust as the brain came out of chaos at the beginning,
p492
aVit's going back into chaos in the end.
p493
aVThis results in declines in memory
p494
aVin cognition, and in postural ability and agility.
p495
aVIt turns out you can train the brain of such an individual \u2014
p496
aVthis is a small population of such individuals \u2014
p497
aVtrain equally intensively for about 30 hours.
p498
aVThese are 80- to 90-year-olds.
p499
aa(lp500
VAnd what you see are substantial improvements of their immediate memory,
p501
aVof their ability to remember things after a delay,
p502
aVof their ability to control their attention,
p503
aVtheir language abilities and visual-spatial abilities.
p504
aVThe overall neuropsychological index
p505
aVof these trained individuals in this population
p506
aVis about two standard deviations.
p507
aVThat means that if you sit at the left side of the distribution,
p508
aVand I'm looking at your neuropyschological abilities,
p509
aVthe average person has moved to the middle
p510
aVor the right side of the distribution.
p511
aVIt means that most people who are at risk for senility,
p512
aVmore or less immediately,
p513
aVare now in a protected position.
p514
aa(lp515
VMy issues are to try to get to rescuing
p516
aVolder citizens more completely and in larger numbers,
p517
aVbecause I think this can be done in this arena on a vast scale \u2014
p518
aVand the same for kids.
p519
aVMy main interest is how to elaborate this science to address other maladies.
p520
aVI'm specifically interested in things like autism,
p521
aVand cerebral palsy, these great childhood catastrophes.
p522
aVAnd in older age conditions like Parkinsonism,
p523
aVand in other acquired impairments like schizophrenia.
p524
aa(lp525
VYour issues as it relates to this science,
p526
aVis how to maintain your own high-functioning learning machine.
p527
aVAnd of course, a well-ordered life
p528
aVin which learning is a continuous part of it, is key.
p529
aVBut also in your future is brain aerobics.
p530
aVGet ready for it. It's going to be a part of every life
p531
aVnot too far in the future,
p532
aVjust like physical exercise
p533
aVis a part of every well organized life in the contemporary period.
p534
aVThe other way that we will ultimately come to consider this
p535
aVliterature and the science that is important to you
p536
aVis in a consideration of how to nurture yourself.
p537
aVNow that you know, now that science is telling us
p538
aVthat you are in charge,
p539
aVthat it's under your control,
p540
aVthat your happiness, your well-being,
p541
aVyour abilities, your capacities,
p542
aVare capable of continuous modification,
p543
aVcontinuous improvement,
p544
aVand you're the responsible agent and party.
p545
aVOf course a lot of people will ignore this advice.
p546
aVIt will be a long time before they really understand it.
p547
aV(Laughter)
p548
aVNow that's another issue and not my fault.
p549
aVOkay. Thank you.
