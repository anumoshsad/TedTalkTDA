VIn the next six minutes that you will listen to me,
p4
aVthe world will have lost three mothers
p5
aVwhile delivering their babies:
p6
aVone, because of a severe complication;
p7
aVsecond, because she will be a teenager
p8
aVand her body will not be prepared for birth;
p9
aVbut the third, only because of lack of access to basic clean tools
p10
aVat the time of childbirth.
p11
aVShe will not be alone.
p12
aVOver one million mothers and babies die every single year
p13
aVin the developing world,
p14
aVonly because of lack of access to basic cleanliness
p15
aVwhile giving birth to their babies.
p16
aa(lp17
VMy journey began on a hot summer afternoon
p18
aVin India in 2008,
p19
aVwhen after a day of meeting women and listening to their needs,
p20
aVI landed in a thatched hut with a midwife.
p21
aVAs a mother, I was very curious on how she delivered babies in her house.
p22
aVAfter a deep and engaging conversation with her
p23
aVon how she considered it a profound calling to do what she was doing,
p24
aVI asked her a parting question:
p25
aVDo you have the tools that you need to deliver the babies?
p26
aVI got to see her tool.
p27
aV"This is what I use to separate the mother and the baby," she said.
p28
aVUnsure of how to react, I held this agricultural tool in my hand in shock.
p29
aVI took a picture of this, hugged her and walked away.
p30
aVMy mind was flooded with reflections of my own infection
p31
aVthat I had to struggle with for a year past childbirth
p32
aVdespite having access to the best medical care,
p33
aVand memories of my conversation with my father,
p34
aVwho had lost his mom to childbirth,
p35
aVon how he thought his life would be so different
p36
aVif she would have been just next to him growing up.
p37
aa(lp38
VAs a product developer, I started my process of research.
p39
aVI was very excited to find that there was a product out there
p40
aVcalled the Clean Birth Kit.
p41
aVBut I just couldn't buy one for months.
p42
aVThey were only assembled based on availability of funding.
p43
aVFinally, when I got my hands on one, I was in shock again.
p44
aVI would never use these tools to deliver my baby, I thought.
p45
aVBut to confirm my instincts, I went back to the women,
p46
aVsome of whom had the experience of using this product.
p47
aa(lp48
VLo and behold, they had the same reaction and more.
p49
aVThe women said they would rather deliver on a floor
p50
aVthan on a plastic sheet that smeared blood all over.
p51
aVThey were absolutely right \u2014 it would cause more infection.
p52
aVThe thread provided was a highway to bacterial infection
p53
aVthrough the baby's umbilical cord,
p54
aVand the blade used was the kind that men used for shaving,
p55
aVand they did not want it anywhere close to them.
p56
aVThere was no incentive for anybody to redesign this product,
p57
aVbecause it was based on charity.
p58
aVThe women were never consulted in this process.
p59
aVAnd to my surprise, the need was not only in homes
p60
aVbut also in institutional settings with high-volume births.
p61
aVSituations in remote areas were even more daunting.
p62
aa(lp63
VThis had to change.
p64
aVI made this my area of focus.
p65
aVI started the design process by collecting feedback,
p66
aVdeveloping prototypes
p67
aVand engaging with various stakeholders researching global protocols.
p68
aVWith every single prototype, we went back to the women
p69
aVto ensure that we had a product for them.
p70
aVWhat I learned through this process was that these women,
p71
aVdespite their extreme poverty,
p72
aVplaced great value on their health and well-being.
p73
aVThey were absolutely not poor in mind.
p74
aVAs with all of us, they would appreciate a well-designed product
p75
aVdeveloped for their needs.
p76
aa(lp77
VAfter many iterations working with experts,
p78
aVmedical health professionals
p79
aVand the women themselves,
p80
aVI should say it was not an easy process at all,
p81
aVbut we had a simple and beautiful design.
p82
aVFor a dollar more than what the existing product was offered for,
p83
aVat three dollars, we were able to deliver "janma,"
p84
aVa clean birth kit in a purse.
p85
aVJanma, meaning "birth," contained a blood-absorbing sheet
p86
aVfor the woman to give birth on,
p87
aVa surgical scalpel, a cord clamp, a bar of soap, a pair of gloves
p88
aVand the first cloth to wipe the baby clean.
p89
aVAll this came packaged in a beautiful purse
p90
aVthat was given to the mother as a gift after all her hard work,
p91
aVthat she carried home with pride as a symbol of prosperity.
p92
aa(lp93
VOne woman reacted to this gift.
p94
aVShe said, "Is this really mine? Can I keep it?"
p95
aVThe other one said, "Will you give me a different color
p96
aVwhen I have my next baby?"
p97
aa(lp98
V(Laughter)
p99
aa(lp100
VBetter yet, a woman expressed that this was the first purse
p101
aVthat she had ever owned in her life.
p102
aVThe kit, aside from its symbolism and its simplicity,
p103
aVis designed to follow globally recommended medical protocol
p104
aVand serves as a behavior-change tool to follow steps one after the other.
p105
aVIt can not only be used in homes, but also in institutional settings.
p106
aa(lp107
VTo date, our kit has impacted over 600,000 mothers and babies
p108
aVaround the world.
p109
aVIt's a humbling experience to watch these numbers grow,
p110
aVand I cannot wait until we reach a hundred million.
p111
aa(lp112
VBut women's health issues do not end here.
p113
aVThere are thousands of simple issues that require low-cost interventions.
p114
aVWe have facts to prove that if we invest in women and girls
p115
aVand provide them with better health and well-being,
p116
aVthey will deliver healthier and wealthier and prosperous communities.
p117
aVWe have to start by bringing simplicity and dignity to women's health issues:
p118
aVfrom reducing maternal mortality, to breaking taboos,
p119
aVto empowering women to take control of their own lives.
p120
aVThis is my dream.
p121
aVBut it is not possible to achieve it without engaging men and women alike
p122
aVfrom around the world \u2014
p123
aVyes, all of you.
p124
aa(lp125
VI recently heard this lyric by Leonard Cohen:
p126
aV"Ring the bells that still can ring.
p127
aVForget your perfect offering.
p128
aVThere is a crack in everything.
p129
aVThat's how the light gets in."
p130
aa(lp131
VThis is my bit of light.
p132
aVBut we need more light.
p133
aVIn fact, we need huge spotlights placed in the world of women's health
p134
aVif we need a better tomorrow.
p135
aVWe should never forget that women are at the center of a sustainable world,
p136
aVand we do not exist without them.
p137
aa(lp138
VThank you.
