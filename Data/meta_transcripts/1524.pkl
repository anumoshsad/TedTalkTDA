VI worked on a film called "Apollo 13,"
p4
aVand when I worked on this film, I discovered something
p5
aVabout how our brains work, and how our brains work
p6
aVis that, when we're sort of infused with
p7
aVeither enthusiasm or awe or fondness or whatever,
p8
aVit changes and alters our perception of things.
p9
aVIt changes what we see. It changes what we remember.
p10
aVAnd as an experiment, because I dauntingly create
p11
aVa task for myself of recreating a Saturn V launch
p12
aVfor this particular movie, because I put it out there,
p13
aVI felt a little nervous about it, so I need to do an experiment
p14
aVand bring a group of people like this in a projection room
p15
aVand play this stock footage, and when I played this
p16
aVstock footage, I simply wanted to find out
p17
aVwhat people remembered, what was memorable about it?
p18
aVWhat should I actually try to replicate?
p19
aVWhat should I try to emulate to some degree?
p20
aa(lp21
VSo this is the footage that I was showing everybody.
p22
aVAnd what I discovered is, because of the nature
p23
aVof the footage and the fact that we're doing this film,
p24
aVthere was an emotion that was built into it
p25
aVand our collective memories of what this launch meant to us
p26
aVand all these various things.
p27
aVWhen I showed it, and I asked, immediately after
p28
aVthe screening was over, what they thought of it,
p29
aVwhat was your memorable shots, they changed them.
p30
aVThey were \u2014 had camera moves on them.
p31
aVThey had all kinds of things. Shots were combined,
p32
aVand I was just really curious, I mean, what the hell
p33
aVwere you looking at just a few minutes ago
p34
aVand how come, how'd you come up with this sort of description?
p35
aVAnd what I discovered is, what I should do is not actually
p36
aVreplicate what they saw, is replicate what they remembered.
p37
aa(lp38
VSo this is our footage of the launch, based on, basically,
p39
aVtaking notes, asking people what they thought, and then
p40
aVthe combination of all the different shots and all
p41
aVthe different things put together created their sort of
p42
aVcollective consciousness of what they remembered
p43
aVit looked like, but not what it really looked like.
p44
aVSo this is what we created for "Apollo 13."
p45
aa(lp46
V(Launch noises)
p47
aa(lp48
VSo literally what you're seeing now is the confluence
p49
aVof a bunch of different people, a bunch of different memories,
p50
aVincluding my own, of taking a little bit of liberty
p51
aVwith the subject matter.
p52
aVI basically shot everything with short lenses,
p53
aVwhich means that you're very close to the action,
p54
aVbut framed it very similarly to the long lens shots
p55
aVwhich gives you a sense of distance, so I was basically
p56
aVwas setting up something that would remind you
p57
aVof something you haven't really quite seen before. (Music)
p58
aVAnd then I'm going to show you exactly what it is
p59
aVthat you were reacting to when you were reacting to it.
p60
aa(lp61
V(Music)
p62
aa(lp63
VTom Hanks: Hello, Houston, this is Odyssey.
p64
aVIt's good to see you again. (Cheers) (Music)
p65
aa(lp66
VRob Legato: I pretend they're clapping for me.
p67
aa(lp68
V(Laughter)
p69
aa(lp70
VSo now I'm in a parking lot. Basically it's a tin can,
p71
aVand I'm basically recreating the launch with
p72
aVfire extinguishers, fire, I have wax that I threw
p73
aVin front of the lens to look like ice, and so basically
p74
aVif you believed any of the stuff that I just showed you,
p75
aVwhat you were reacting to, what you're emoting to,
p76
aVis something that's a total falsehood, and I found that
p77
aVreally kind of fascinating.
p78
aa(lp79
VAnd in this particular case, this is the climax of the movie,
p80
aVand, you know, the weight of achieving it was simply
p81
aVtake a model, throw it out of a helicopter, and shoot it.
p82
aVAnd that's simply what I did.
p83
aVThat's me shooting, and I'm a fairly mediocre operator,
p84
aVso I got that nice sense of verisimilitude, of a kind of,
p85
aVyou know, following the rocket all the way down,
p86
aVand giving that little sort of edge, I was desperately
p87
aVtrying to keep it in frame. So then I come up to the next thing.
p88
aVWe had a NASA consultant who was actually an astronaut,
p89
aVwho was actually on some of the missions, of Apollo 15,
p90
aVand he was there to basically double check my science.
p91
aVAnd, I guess somebody thought they needed to do that.
p92
aa(lp93
V(Laughter)
p94
aa(lp95
VI don't know why, but they thought they did.
p96
aa(lp97
VSo we were, he's a hero, he's an astronaut, and
p98
aVwe're all sort of excited, and, you know, I gave myself
p99
aVthe liberty of saying, you know, some of the shots I did
p100
aVdidn't really suck that bad.
p101
aVAnd so maybe, you know, we were feeling kind of a little
p102
aVgood about it, so I brought him in here, and he needed
p103
aVto really check and see what we were doing,
p104
aVand basically give us our A plus report card,
p105
aVand so I showed him some shots we were working on,
p106
aVand waiting for the reaction that you hope for,
p107
aVwhich is what I got. (Music) (Launch noises)
p108
aVSo I showed him these two shots,
p109
aVand then he basically told me what he thought.
p110
aa(lp111
V("That's wrong") (Laughter)
p112
aa(lp113
VOkay. (Laughter)
p114
aVIt's what you dream about.
p115
aa(lp116
V(Laughter)
p117
aa(lp118
VSo what I got from him is, he turned to me and said,
p119
aV"You would never, ever design a rocket like that.
p120
aVYou would never have a rocket go up
p121
aVwhile the gantry arms are going out. Can you imagine
p122
aVthe tragedy that could possibly happen with that?
p123
aVYou would never, ever design a rocket like that."
p124
aVAnd he was looking at me. It's like, Yeah, I don't know
p125
aVif you noticed, but I'm the guy out in the parking lot
p126
aVrecreating one of America's finest moments with
p127
aVfire extinguishers.
p128
aa(lp129
V(Laughter)
p130
aa(lp131
VAnd I'm not going to argue with you. You're an astronaut,
p132
aVa hero, and I'm from New Jersey, so \u2014
p133
aa(lp134
V(Laughter)
p135
aa(lp136
VI'm just going to show you some footage.
p137
aVI'm just going to show you some footage, and tell me what you think.
p138
aVAnd then I did kind of get the reaction I was hoping for.
p139
aa(lp140
VSo I showed him this, and this is actual footage
p141
aVthat he was on. This is Apollo 15. This was his mission.
p142
aVSo I showed him this, and the reaction I got was interesting.
p143
aa(lp144
V("That's wrong too.") (Laughter)
p145
aa(lp146
VSo, and what happened was, I mean, what I sort of intuned
p147
aVin that is that he remembered it differently.
p148
aVHe remembered that was a perfectly safe sort of gantry
p149
aVsystem, perfectly safe rocket launch, because he's sitting
p150
aVin a rocket that has, like, a hundred thousand pounds
p151
aVof thrust, built by the lowest bidder.
p152
aVHe was hoping it was going to work out okay.
p153
aa(lp154
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p155
aa(lp156
VSo he twisted his memory around.
p157
aa(lp158
VNow, Ron Howard ran into Buzz Aldrin, who was not
p159
aVon the movie, so he had no idea that we were faking
p160
aVany of this footage, and he just responded
p161
aVas he would respond, and I'll run this.
p162
aa(lp163
VRon Howard: Buzz Aldrin came up to me
p164
aVand said, "Hey, that launch footage, I saw some shots
p165
aVI'd never seen before. Did you guys, what vault did you find
p166
aVthat stuff in?" And I said, "Well, no vault, Buzz,
p167
aVwe generated all that from scratch."
p168
aa(lp169
VAnd he said, "Huh, that's pretty good. Can we use it?"
p170
aa(lp171
V(Explosion) ("Sure") (Laughter)
p172
aa(lp173
VRL: I think he's a great American.
p174
aa(lp175
V(Laughter)
p176
aa(lp177
VSo, "Titanic" was, if you don't know the story,
p178
aVdoesn't end well.
p179
aa(lp180
V(Laughter)
p181
aa(lp182
VJim Cameron actually photographed the real Titanic.
p183
aVSo he basically set up, or basically shattered
p184
aVthe suspension of disbelief, because what he photographed
p185
aVwas the real thing, a Mir sub going down, or actually
p186
aVtwo Mir subs going down to the real wreck,
p187
aVand he created this very haunting footage.
p188
aVIt's really beautiful, and it conjures up all these
p189
aVvarious different emotions, but he couldn't photograph
p190
aVeverything, and to tell the story,
p191
aVI had to fill in the gaps, which is now rather daunting,
p192
aVbecause now I have to recreate back to back
p193
aVwhat really happened and I had, I'm the only one
p194
aVwho could really blow it at that point.
p195
aa(lp196
VSo this is the footage he photographed,
p197
aVand it was pretty moving and pretty awe-inspiring.
p198
aVSo I'm going to just let it run, so you kind of absorb
p199
aVthis sort of thing, and I'll describe my sort of reactions
p200
aVwhen I was looking at it for the very first time.
p201
aVI got the feeling that my brain wanted to basically
p202
aVsee it come back to life.
p203
aVI automatically wanted to see this ship,
p204
aVthis magnificent ship, basically in all its glory,
p205
aVand conversely, I wanted to see it not in all its glory,
p206
aVbasically go back to what it looks like.
p207
aa(lp208
VSo I conjured up an effect that I'm later going to show you
p209
aVwhat I tried to do, which is kind of the heart of the movie,
p210
aVfor me, and so that's why I wanted to do the movie,
p211
aVthat's why I wanted to create the sort of things I created.
p212
aa(lp213
VAnd I'll show you, you know, another thing that I found
p214
aVinteresting is what we really were emoting to
p215
aVwhen you take a look at it.
p216
aVSo here's the behind the scenes, a couple of little shots here.
p217
aVSo, when you saw my footage,
p218
aVyou were seeing this: basically, a bunch of guys
p219
aVflipping a ship upside down, and the little Mir subs
p220
aVare actually about the size of small footballs,
p221
aVand shot in smoke.
p222
aVJim went three miles went down, and I went about
p223
aVthree miles away from the studio
p224
aVand photographed this in a garage.
p225
aa(lp226
VAnd so, but what you're emoting to, or what you're looking
p227
aVat, had the same feeling, the same haunting quality,
p228
aVthat Jim's footage had, so I found it so fascinating
p229
aVthat our brains sort of, once you believe something's real,
p230
aVyou transfer everything that you feel about it,
p231
aVthis quality you have, and it's totally artificial.
p232
aVIt's totally make-believe, yet it's not to you,
p233
aVand I found that that was a very interesting thing
p234
aVto explore and use, and it caused me to create the next
p235
aVeffect that I'll show you, which is
p236
aVthis sort of magic transition, and all I was really attempting
p237
aVto do is basically have the audience cue the effect,
p238
aVso it became a seamless experience for them,
p239
aVthat I wasn't showing you my sort of interpretation,
p240
aVI was showing you what you wanted to see.
p241
aVAnd the very next shot, right after this \u2014
p242
aVSo you can see what I was doing.
p243
aa(lp244
VSo basically, if there's two subs in the same shot,
p245
aVI shot it, because where's the camera coming from?
p246
aVAnd when Jim shot it, it was only one sub,
p247
aVbecause he was photographing from the other,
p248
aVand I don't remember if I did this or Jim did this.
p249
aVI'll give it to Jim, because he could use the pat on the back.
p250
aa(lp251
V(Laughter)
p252
aa(lp253
VOkay. So now the Titanic transition.
p254
aVSo this is what I was referring to where I wanted to basically
p255
aVmagically transplant from one state of the Titanic
p256
aVto the other. So I'll just play the shot once. (Music)
p257
aa(lp258
V(Music)
p259
aa(lp260
VAnd what I was hoping for is that it just melts in front of you.
p261
aa(lp262
VGloria Stuart: That was the last time Titanic ever saw daylight.
p263
aa(lp264
VRL: So, what I did is basically I had another
p265
aVscreening room experience where I was basically tracking
p266
aVwhere I was looking, or where we were looking,
p267
aVand of course you're looking at the two people on the bow
p268
aVof the ship, and then at some point,
p269
aVI'm changing the periphery of the shot,
p270
aVI'm changing, it's becoming the rusted wreck,
p271
aVand then I would run it every day, and then I would find
p272
aVexactly the moment that I stopped looking at them
p273
aVand start noticing the rest of it, and the moment
p274
aVmy eye shifted, we just marked it to the frame.
p275
aVThe moment my eye shifted, I immediately started
p276
aVto change them, so now somehow you missed
p277
aVwhere it started and where it stopped.
p278
aVAnd so I'll just show it one more time.
p279
aV(Music) And it's literally done by using what our brains
p280
aVnaturally do for us, which is, as soon as you shift
p281
aVyour attention, something changes, and then I left
p282
aVthe little scarf going, because it really wanted to be
p283
aVa ghostly shot, really wanted to feel like they were still
p284
aVon the wreck, essentially. That's where they were buried forever.
p285
aa(lp286
VOr something like that. I just made that up.
p287
aa(lp288
V(Laughter)
p289
aa(lp290
VIt was, incidentally, the last time I ever saw daylight.
p291
aVIt was a long film to work on. (Laughter)
p292
aa(lp293
VNow, "Hugo" was another interesting movie, because
p294
aVthe movie itself is about film illusions.
p295
aVIt's about how our brain is tricked into seeing a persistence
p296
aVof vision that creates a motion picture,
p297
aVand one of the things I had to do is, we \u2014
p298
aVSasha Baron Cohen is a very clever, very smart guy,
p299
aVcomedian, wanted to basically do an homage to the kind of
p300
aVthe Buster Keaton sort of slapstick things, and he wanted
p301
aVhis leg brace to get caught on a moving train.
p302
aVVery dangerous, very impossible to do, and particularly
p303
aVon our stage, because there literally is no way to actually
p304
aVmove this train, because it fits so snugly into our set.
p305
aa(lp306
VSo let me show you the scene, and then I basically
p307
aVused the trick that was identified by Sergei Eisenstein,
p308
aVwhich is, if you have a camera that's moving with a moving
p309
aVobject, what is not moving appears to be moving,
p310
aVand what is moving appears to be stopped,
p311
aVso what you're actually seeing now is the train is not
p312
aVmoving at all, and what is actually moving is the floor.
p313
aa(lp314
VSo this is the shot. That's a little video of
p315
aVwhat you're looking at there, which is our little test,
p316
aVso that's actually what you're seeing, and I thought it was
p317
aVsort of an interesting thing, because it was, part
p318
aVof the homage of the movie itself is coming up with this
p319
aVsort of genius trick which I can't take credit for.
p320
aVI'd love to but I can't, because it was invented
p321
aVlike in 1910 or something like that, is I told Marty,
p322
aVand it's kind of one of those mind things that it's
p323
aVreally hard to really get until you actually see it work,
p324
aVand I said, you know, what I was going to do, and he said,
p325
aV"So, let me see if I can get this straight. The thing with the wheels?
p326
aVThat doesn't move."
p327
aa(lp328
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p329
aa(lp330
V"And the thing without the wheels, that moves."
p331
aa(lp332
VPrecisely. (Laughter)
p333
aa(lp334
VBrings me to the next, and final \u2014
p335
aa(lp336
VMarty's not going to see this, is he? (Laughter)
p337
aVThis isn't viewed outside of \u2014 (Laughter)
p338
aa(lp339
VThe next illustration is something that, there's like
p340
aVall one shot theory. It's a very elegant way of telling a story,
p341
aVespecially if you're following somebody on a journey,
p342
aVand that journey basically tells something about
p343
aVtheir personality in a very concise way,
p344
aVand what we wanted to do based on the shot in "Goodfellas,"
p345
aVwhich is one of the great shots ever,
p346
aVa Martin Scorsese film, of basically following Henry Hill
p347
aVthrough what it feels like to be a gangster walk
p348
aVgoing through the Copacabana and being treated in a special way.
p349
aVHe was the master of his universe, and we wanted Hugo
p350
aVto feel the same way, so we created this shot.
p351
aa(lp352
V(Music)
p353
aVThat's Hugo. (Music)
p354
aVAnd we felt that if we could basically move the camera
p355
aVwith him, we would feel what it feels like to be this boy
p356
aVwho is basically the master of his universe,
p357
aVand his universe is, you know, behind the scenes
p358
aVin the bowels of this particular train station
p359
aVthat only he can actually navigate through
p360
aVand do it this way, and we had to make it feel that
p361
aVthis is his normal, everyday sort of life,
p362
aVso the idea of doing it as one shot was very important,
p363
aVand of course, in shooting in 3D, which is basically
p364
aVit's a huge camera that's hanging off of a giant stick,
p365
aVso to recreate a steadycam shot was the task,
p366
aVand make it feel kind of like what the reaction you got
p367
aVwhen you saw the "Goodfellas" shot.
p368
aa(lp369
VSo what you're now going to see is how we actually did it.
p370
aVIt's actually five separate sets shot at five different times
p371
aVwith two different boys.
p372
aVThe one on the left is where the shot ends,
p373
aVand the shot on the right is where it takes over,
p374
aVand now we switch boys, so it went from Asa Butterfield,
p375
aVwho's the star of the show, to his stand-in. (Music)
p376
aVI wouldn't say his stunt double. There's a crazy rig
p377
aVthat we built for this. (Music)
p378
aVAnd so this is, and now this is set number three
p379
aVwe're into, and then we're going to go into, basically
p380
aVthe very last moment of the shot is actually
p381
aVthe steadycam shot. Everything else was shot on cranes
p382
aVand various things like that, and it literally was done
p383
aVover five different sets, two different boys, different times,
p384
aVand it all had to feel like it was all one shot, and what was
p385
aVsort of great for me was it was probably
p386
aVthe best-reviewed shot I've ever worked on,
p387
aVand, you know, I was kind of proud of it when I was done,
p388
aVwhich is, you should never really be proud of stuff, I guess.
p389
aa(lp390
VSo I was kind of proud of it, and I went to a friend of mine,
p391
aVand said, "You know, this is, you know, kind of
p392
aVthe best-reviewed shot I've ever worked on.
p393
aVWhat do you think was the reason?"
p394
aa(lp395
VAnd he said, "Because no one knows
p396
aVyou had anything to do with it."
p397
aa(lp398
V(Laughter)
p399
aa(lp400
VSo, all I can say is, thank you,
p401
aVand that's my presentation for you. (Applause)
