VWell, Arthur C. Clarke,
p4
aVa famous science fiction writer from the 1950s,
p5
aVsaid that, "We overestimate technology in the short term,
p6
aVand we underestimate it in the long term."
p7
aVAnd I think that's some of the fear that we see
p8
aVabout jobs disappearing from artificial intelligence and robots.
p9
aVThat we're overestimating the technology in the short term.
p10
aVBut I am worried whether we're going to get the technology we need in the long term.
p11
aVBecause the demographics are really going to leave us with lots of jobs that need doing
p12
aVand that we, our society, is going to have to be built on the shoulders of steel of robots in the future.
p13
aVSo I'm scared we won't have enough robots.
p14
aVBut fear of losing jobs to technology has been around for a long time.
p15
aVBack in 1957, there was a Spencer Tracy, Katharine Hepburn movie.
p16
aVSo you know how it ended up,
p17
aVSpencer Tracy brought a computer, a mainframe computer of 1957, in
p18
aVto help the librarians.
p19
aVThe librarians in the company would do things like answer for the executives,
p20
aV"What are the names of Santa's reindeer?"
p21
aVAnd they would look that up.
p22
aVAnd this mainframe computer was going to help them with that job.
p23
aVWell of course a mainframe computer in 1957 wasn't much use for that job.
p24
aVThe librarians were afraid their jobs were going to disappear.
p25
aVBut that's not what happened in fact.
p26
aVThe number of jobs for librarians increased for a long time after 1957.
p27
aVIt wasn't until the Internet came into play,
p28
aVthe web came into play and search engines came into play
p29
aVthat the need for librarians went down.
p30
aVAnd I think everyone from 1957 totally underestimated
p31
aVthe level of technology we would all carry around in our hands and in our pockets today.
p32
aVAnd we can just ask: "What are the names of Santa's reindeer?" and be told instantly \u2014
p33
aVor anything else we want to ask.
p34
aVBy the way, the wages for librarians went up faster
p35
aVthan the wages for other jobs in the U.S. over that same time period,
p36
aVbecause librarians became partners of computers.
p37
aVComputers became tools, and they got more tools that they could use
p38
aVand become more effective during that time.
p39
aVSame thing happened in offices.
p40
aVBack in the old days, people used spreadsheets.
p41
aVSpreadsheets were spread sheets of paper,
p42
aVand they calculated by hand.
p43
aVBut here was an interesting thing that came along.
p44
aVWith the revolution around 1980 of P.C.'s,
p45
aVthe spreadsheet programs were tuned for office workers,
p46
aVnot to replace office workers,
p47
aVbut it respected office workers as being capable of being programmers.
p48
aVSo office workers became programmers of spreadsheets.
p49
aVIt increased their capabilities.
p50
aVThey no longer had to do the mundane computations,
p51
aVbut they could do something much more.
p52
aVNow today, we're starting to see robots in our lives.
p53
aVOn the left there is the PackBot from iRobot.
p54
aVWhen soldiers came across roadside bombs in Iraq and Afghanistan,
p55
aVinstead of putting on a bomb suit and going out and poking with a stick,
p56
aVas they used to do up until about 2002,
p57
aVthey now send the robot out.
p58
aVSo the robot takes over the dangerous jobs.
p59
aVOn the right are some TUGs from a company called Aethon in Pittsburgh.
p60
aVThese are in hundreds of hospitals across the U.S.
p61
aVAnd they take the dirty sheets down to the laundry.
p62
aVThey take the dirty dishes back to the kitchen.
p63
aVThey bring the medicines up from the pharmacy.
p64
aVAnd it frees up the nurses and the nurse's aides
p65
aVfrom doing that mundane work of just mechanically pushing stuff around
p66
aVto spend more time with patients.
p67
aVIn fact, robots have become sort of ubiquitous in our lives in many ways.
p68
aVBut I think when it comes to factory robots, people are sort of afraid,
p69
aVbecause factory robots are dangerous to be around.
p70
aVIn order to program them, you have to understand six-dimensional vectors and quaternions.
p71
aVAnd ordinary people can't interact with them.
p72
aVAnd I think it's the sort of technology that's gone wrong.
p73
aVIt's displaced the worker from the technology.
p74
aVAnd I think we really have to look at technologies
p75
aVthat ordinary workers can interact with.
p76
aVAnd so I want to tell you today about Baxter, which we've been talking about.
p77
aVAnd Baxter, I see, as a way \u2014 a first wave of robot
p78
aVthat ordinary people can interact with in an industrial setting.
p79
aVSo Baxter is up here.
p80
aVThis is Chris Harbert from Rethink Robotics.
p81
aVWe've got a conveyor there.
p82
aVAnd if the lighting isn't too extreme \u2014
p83
aVAh, ah! There it is. It's picked up the object off the conveyor.
p84
aVIt's going to come bring it over here and put it down.
p85
aVAnd then it'll go back, reach for another object.
p86
aVThe interesting thing is Baxter has some basic common sense.
p87
aVBy the way, what's going on with the eyes?
p88
aVThe eyes are on the screen there.
p89
aVThe eyes look ahead where the robot's going to move.
p90
aVSo a person that's interacting with the robot
p91
aVunderstands where it's going to reach and isn't surprised by its motions.
p92
aVHere Chris took the object out of its hand,
p93
aVand Baxter didn't go and try to put it down;
p94
aVit went back and realized it had to get another one.
p95
aVIt's got a little bit of basic common sense, goes and picks the objects.
p96
aVAnd Baxter's safe to interact with.
p97
aVYou wouldn't want to do this with a current industrial robot.
p98
aVBut with Baxter it doesn't hurt.
p99
aVIt feels the force, understands that Chris is there
p100
aVand doesn't push through him and hurt him.
p101
aVBut I think the most interesting thing about Baxter is the user interface.
p102
aVAnd so Chris is going to come and grab the other arm now.
p103
aVAnd when he grabs an arm, it goes into zero-force gravity-compensated mode
p104
aVand graphics come up on the screen.
p105
aVYou can see some icons on the left of the screen there for what was about its right arm.
p106
aVHe's going to put something in its hand, he's going to bring it over here,
p107
aVpress a button and let go of that thing in the hand.
p108
aVAnd the robot figures out, ah, he must mean I want to put stuff down.
p109
aVIt puts a little icon there.
p110
aVHe comes over here, and he gets the fingers to grasp together,
p111
aVand the robot infers, ah, you want an object for me to pick up.
p112
aVThat puts the green icon there.
p113
aVHe's going to map out an area of where the robot should pick up the object from.
p114
aVIt just moves it around, and the robot figures out that was an area search.
p115
aVHe didn't have to select that from a menu.
p116
aVAnd now he's going to go off and train the visual appearance of that object
p117
aVwhile we continue talking.
p118
aVSo as we continue here,
p119
aVI want to tell you about what this is like in factories.
p120
aVThese robots we're shipping every day.
p121
aVThey go to factories around the country.
p122
aVThis is Mildred.
p123
aVMildred's a factory worker in Connecticut.
p124
aVShe's worked on the line for over 20 years.
p125
aVOne hour after she saw her first industrial robot,
p126
aVshe had programmed it to do some tasks in the factory.
p127
aVShe decided she really liked robots.
p128
aVAnd it was doing the simple repetitive tasks that she had had to do beforehand.
p129
aVNow she's got the robot doing it.
p130
aVWhen we first went out to talk to people in factories
p131
aVabout how we could get robots to interact with them better,
p132
aVone of the questions we asked them was,
p133
aV"Do you want your children to work in a factory?"
p134
aVThe universal answer was "No, I want a better job than that for my children."
p135
aVAnd as a result of that, Mildred is very typical
p136
aVof today's factory workers in the U.S.
p137
aVThey're older, and they're getting older and older.
p138
aVThere aren't many young people coming into factory work.
p139
aVAnd as their tasks become more onerous on them,
p140
aVwe need to give them tools that they can collaborate with,
p141
aVso that they can be part of the solution,
p142
aVso that they can continue to work and we can continue to produce in the U.S.
p143
aVAnd so our vision is that Mildred who's the line worker
p144
aVbecomes Mildred the robot trainer.
p145
aVShe lifts her game,
p146
aVlike the office workers of the 1980s lifted their game of what they could do.
p147
aVWe're not giving them tools that they have to go and study for years and years in order to use.
p148
aVThey're tools that they can just learn how to operate in a few minutes.
p149
aVThere's two great forces that are both volitional but inevitable.
p150
aVThat's climate change and demographics.
p151
aVDemographics is really going to change our world.
p152
aVThis is the percentage of adults who are working age.
p153
aVAnd it's gone down slightly over the last 40 years.
p154
aVBut over the next 40 years, it's going to change dramatically, even in China.
p155
aVThe percentage of adults who are working age drops dramatically.
p156
aVAnd turned up the other way, the people who are retirement age goes up very, very fast,
p157
aVas the baby boomers get to retirement age.
p158
aVThat means there will be more people with fewer social security dollars
p159
aVcompeting for services.
p160
aVBut more than that, as we get older we get more frail
p161
aVand we can't do all the tasks we used to do.
p162
aVIf we look at the statistics on the ages of caregivers,
p163
aVbefore our eyes those caregivers are getting older and older.
p164
aVThat's happening statistically right now.
p165
aVAnd as the number of people who are older, above retirement age and getting older, as they increase,
p166
aVthere will be less people to take care of them.
p167
aVAnd I think we're really going to have to have robots to help us.
p168
aVAnd I don't mean robots in terms of companions.
p169
aVI mean robots doing the things that we normally do for ourselves
p170
aVbut get harder as we get older.
p171
aVGetting the groceries in from the car, up the stairs, into the kitchen.
p172
aVOr even, as we get very much older,
p173
aVdriving our cars to go visit people.
p174
aVAnd I think robotics gives people a chance to have dignity as they get older
p175
aVby having control of the robotic solution.
p176
aVSo they don't have to rely on people that are getting scarcer to help them.
p177
aVAnd so I really think that we're going to be spending more time
p178
aVwith robots like Baxter
p179
aVand working with robots like Baxter in our daily lives. And that we will \u2014
p180
aVHere, Baxter, it's good.
p181
aVAnd that we will all come to rely on robots over the next 40 years
p182
aVas part of our everyday lives.
p183
aVThanks very much.
