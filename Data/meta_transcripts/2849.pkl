VBefore I get to bulk of what I have to say,
p4
aVI feel compelled just to mention a couple of things about myself.
p5
aVI am not some mystical,
p6
aVspiritual sort of person.
p7
aVI'm a science writer.
p8
aVI studied physics in college.
p9
aVI used to be a science correspondent for NPR.
p10
aVOK, that said:
p11
aVin the course of working on a story for NPR,
p12
aVI got some advice from an astronomer
p13
aVthat challenged my outlook,
p14
aVand frankly, changed my life.
p15
aa(lp16
VYou see, the story was about an eclipse,
p17
aVa partial solar eclipse that was set to cross the country
p18
aVin May of 1994.
p19
aVAnd the astronomer \u2014 I interviewed him,
p20
aVand he explained what was going to happen and how to view it,
p21
aVbut he emphasized that, as interesting as a partial solar eclipse is,
p22
aVa much rarer total solar eclipse is completely different.
p23
aVIn a total eclipse, for all of two or three minutes,
p24
aVthe moon completely blocks the face of the sun,
p25
aVcreating what he described as the most awe-inspiring spectacle
p26
aVin all of nature.
p27
aVAnd so the advice he gave me was this:
p28
aV"Before you die," he said,
p29
aV"you owe it to yourself to experience a total solar eclipse."
p30
aa(lp31
VWell honestly, I felt a little uncomfortable
p32
aVhearing that from someone I didn't know very well;
p33
aVit felt sort of intimate.
p34
aVBut it got my attention, and so I did some research.
p35
aVNow the thing about total eclipses is,
p36
aVif you wait for one to come to you,
p37
aVyou're going to be waiting a long time.
p38
aVAny given point on earth experiences a total eclipse
p39
aVabout once every 400 years.
p40
aVBut if you're willing to travel, you don't have to wait that long.
p41
aVAnd so I learned that a few years later, in 1998,
p42
aVa total eclipse was going to cross the Caribbean.
p43
aa(lp44
VNow, a total eclipse is visible only along a narrow path,
p45
aVabout a hundred miles wide,
p46
aVand that's where the moon's shadow falls.
p47
aVIt's called the "path of totality."
p48
aVAnd in February 1998,
p49
aVthe path of totality was going to cross Aruba.
p50
aVSo I talked to my husband, and we thought: February? Aruba?
p51
aVSounded like a good idea anyway.
p52
aa(lp53
V(Laughter)
p54
aa(lp55
VSo we headed south,
p56
aVto enjoy the sun and to see what would happen
p57
aVwhen the sun briefly went away.
p58
aa(lp59
VWell, the day of the eclipse found us and many other people
p60
aVout behind the Hyatt Regency,
p61
aVon the beach,
p62
aVwaiting for the show to begin.
p63
aVAnd we wore eclipse glasses with cardboard frames
p64
aVand really dark lenses that enabled us to look at the sun safely.
p65
aVA total eclipse begins as a partial eclipse,
p66
aVas the moon very slowly makes its way in front of the sun.
p67
aVSo first it looked the sun had a little notch in its edge,
p68
aVand then that notch grew larger and larger,
p69
aVturning the sun into a crescent.
p70
aVAnd it was all very interesting, but I wouldn't say it was spectacular.
p71
aVI mean, the day remained bright.
p72
aVIf I hadn't known what was going on overhead,
p73
aVI wouldn't have noticed anything unusual.
p74
aa(lp75
VWell, about 10 minutes before the total solar eclipse was set to begin,
p76
aVweird things started to happen.
p77
aVA cool wind kicked up.
p78
aVDaylight looked odd, and shadows became very strange;
p79
aVthey looked bizarrely sharp,
p80
aVas if someone had turned up the contrast knob on the TV.
p81
aVThen I looked offshore, and I noticed running lights on boats,
p82
aVso clearly it was getting dark,
p83
aValthough I hadn't realized it.
p84
aVWell soon, it was obvious it was getting dark.
p85
aVIt felt like my eyesight was failing.
p86
aa(lp87
VAnd then all of a sudden,
p88
aVthe lights went out.
p89
aVWell, at that,
p90
aVa cheer erupted from the beach,
p91
aVand I took off my eclipse glasses,
p92
aVbecause at this point during the total eclipse,
p93
aVit was safe to look at the sun with the naked eye.
p94
aVAnd I glanced upward,
p95
aVand I was just dumbstruck.
p96
aa(lp97
VNow, consider that, at this point, I was in my mid-30s.
p98
aVI had lived on earth long enough to know what the sky looks like.
p99
aVI mean \u2014
p100
aa(lp101
V(Laughter)
p102
aa(lp103
VI'd seen blue skies and grey skies
p104
aVand starry skies and angry skies
p105
aVand pink skies at sunrise.
p106
aVBut here was a sky I had never seen.
p107
aa(lp108
VFirst, there were the colors.
p109
aVUp above, it was a deep purple-grey,
p110
aVlike twilight.
p111
aVBut on the horizon it was orange,
p112
aVlike sunset,
p113
aV360 degrees.
p114
aVAnd up above, in the twilight,
p115
aVbright stars and planets had come out.
p116
aVSo there was Jupiter
p117
aVand there was Mercury
p118
aVand there was Venus.
p119
aVThey were all in a line.
p120
aa(lp121
VAnd there, along this line,
p122
aVwas this thing,
p123
aVthis glorious, bewildering thing.
p124
aVIt looked like a wreath woven from silvery thread,
p125
aVand it just hung out there in space, shimmering.
p126
aVThat was the sun's outer atmosphere,
p127
aVthe solar corona.
p128
aVAnd pictures just don't do it justice.
p129
aVIt's not just a ring or halo around the sun;
p130
aVit's finely textured, like it's made out of strands of silk.
p131
aVAnd although it looked nothing like our sun,
p132
aVof course, I knew that's what it was.
p133
aVSo there was the sun, and there were the planets,
p134
aVand I could see how the planets revolve around the sun.
p135
aVIt's like I had left our solar system
p136
aVand was standing on some alien world,
p137
aVlooking back at creation.
p138
aa(lp139
VAnd for the first time in my life,
p140
aVI just felt viscerally connected to the universe
p141
aVin all of its immensity.
p142
aVTime stopped,
p143
aVor it just kind of felt nonexistent,
p144
aVand what I beheld with my eyes \u2014
p145
aVI didn't just see it,
p146
aVit felt like a vision.
p147
aVAnd I stood there in this nirvana
p148
aVfor all of 174 seconds \u2014 less than three minutes \u2014
p149
aVwhen all of a sudden, it was over.
p150
aVThe sun burst out,
p151
aVthe blue sky returned,
p152
aVthe stars and the planets and the corona were gone.
p153
aVThe world returned to normal.
p154
aVBut I had changed.
p155
aa(lp156
VAnd that's how I became an umbraphile \u2014
p157
aVan eclipse chaser.
p158
aa(lp159
V(Laughter)
p160
aa(lp161
VSo, this is how I spend my time and hard-earned money.
p162
aVEvery couple of years, I head off to wherever the moon's shadow will fall
p163
aVto experience another couple minutes
p164
aVof cosmic bliss,
p165
aVand to share the experience with others:
p166
aVwith friends in Australia,
p167
aVwith an entire city in Germany.
p168
aVIn 1999, in Munich, I joined hundreds of thousands
p169
aVwho filled the streets and the rooftops and cheered in unison
p170
aVas the solar corona emerged.
p171
aVAnd over time, I've become something else:
p172
aVan eclipse evangelist.
p173
aVI see it as my job
p174
aVto pay forward the advice that I received all those years ago.
p175
aVAnd so let me tell you:
p176
aVbefore you die,
p177
aVyou owe it to yourself to experience a total solar eclipse.
p178
aVIt is the ultimate experience of awe.
p179
aa(lp180
VNow, that word, "awesome," has grown so overused
p181
aVthat it's lost its original meaning.
p182
aVTrue awe, a sense of wonder and insignificance
p183
aVin the face of something enormous and grand,
p184
aVis rare in our lives.
p185
aVBut when you experience it, it's powerful.
p186
aVAwe dissolves the ego.
p187
aVIt makes us feel connected.
p188
aVIndeed, it promotes empathy and generosity.
p189
aVWell, there is nothing truly more awesome than a total solar eclipse.
p190
aa(lp191
VUnfortunately, few Americans have seen one,
p192
aVbecause it's been 38 years
p193
aVsince one last touched the continental United States
p194
aVand 99 years since one last crossed the breadth of the nation.
p195
aVBut that is about to change.
p196
aVOver the next 35 years,
p197
aVfive total solar eclipses will visit the continental United States,
p198
aVand three of them will be especially grand.
p199
aVSix weeks from now, on August 21, 2017 \u2014
p200
aa(lp201
V(Applause)
p202
aa(lp203
Vthe moon's shadow will race from Oregon to South Carolina.
p204
aVApril 8, 2024, the moon's shadow heads north from Texas to Maine.
p205
aVIn 2045, on August 12,
p206
aVthe path cuts from California to Florida.
p207
aa(lp208
VI say:
p209
aVWhat if we made these holidays?
p210
aVWhat if we \u2014
p211
aa(lp212
V(Laughter)
p213
aa(lp214
V(Applause)
p215
aa(lp216
VWhat if we all stood together,
p217
aVas many people as possible,
p218
aVin the shadow of the moon?
p219
aVJust maybe, this shared experience of awe would help heal our divisions,
p220
aVget us to treat each other just a bit more humanely.
p221
aa(lp222
VNow, admittedly, some folks consider my evangelizing a little out there;
p223
aVmy obsession, eccentric.
p224
aVI mean, why focus so much attention on something so brief?
p225
aVWhy cross the globe \u2014 or state lines, for that matter \u2014
p226
aVfor something that lasts three minutes?
p227
aVAs I said:
p228
aVI am not a spiritual person.
p229
aVI don't believe in God.
p230
aVI wish I did.
p231
aVBut when I think of my own mortality \u2014
p232
aVand I do, a lot \u2014
p233
aVwhen I think of everyone I have lost,
p234
aVmy mother in particular,
p235
aVwhat soothes me
p236
aVis that moment of awe I had in Aruba.
p237
aVI picture myself on that beach,
p238
aVlooking at that sky,
p239
aVand I remember how I felt.
p240
aVMy existence may be temporary,
p241
aVbut that's OK because, my gosh,
p242
aVlook at what I'm a part of.
p243
aa(lp244
VAnd so this is a lesson I've learned,
p245
aVand it's one that applies to life in general:
p246
aVduration of experience does not equal impact.
p247
aVOne weekend, one conversation \u2014 hell, one glance \u2014
p248
aVcan change everything.
p249
aVCherish those moments of deep connection with other people,
p250
aVwith the natural world,
p251
aVand make them a priority.
p252
aVYes, I chase eclipses.
p253
aVYou might chase something else.
p254
aVBut it's not about the 174 seconds.
p255
aVIt's about how they change
p256
aVthe years that come after.
p257
aa(lp258
VThank you.
