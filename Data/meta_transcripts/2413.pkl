VDemocracy.
p4
aVIn the West,
p5
aVwe make a colossal mistake taking it for granted.
p6
aVWe see democracy
p7
aVnot as the most fragile of flowers that it really is,
p8
aVbut we see it as part of our society's furniture.
p9
aVWe tend to think of it as an intransigent given.
p10
aVWe mistakenly believe that capitalism begets inevitably democracy.
p11
aVIt doesn't.
p12
aa(lp13
VSingapore's Lee Kuan Yew and his great imitators in Beijing
p14
aVhave demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt
p15
aVthat it is perfectly possible to have a flourishing capitalism,
p16
aVspectacular growth,
p17
aVwhile politics remains democracy-free.
p18
aVIndeed, democracy is receding in our neck of the woods,
p19
aVhere in Europe.
p20
aa(lp21
VEarlier this year, while I was representing Greece \u2014
p22
aVthe newly elected Greek government \u2014
p23
aVin the Eurogroup as its Finance Minister,
p24
aVI was told in no uncertain terms that our nation's democratic process \u2014
p25
aVour elections \u2014
p26
aVcould not be allowed to interfere
p27
aVwith economic policies that were being implemented in Greece.
p28
aVAt that moment,
p29
aVI felt that there could be no greater vindication of Lee Kuan Yew,
p30
aVor the Chinese Communist Party,
p31
aVindeed of some recalcitrant friends of mine who kept telling me
p32
aVthat democracy would be banned if it ever threatened to change anything.
p33
aa(lp34
VTonight, here, I want to present to you
p35
aVan economic case for an authentic democracy.
p36
aVI want to ask you to join me in believing again
p37
aVthat Lee Kuan Yew,
p38
aVthe Chinese Communist Party
p39
aVand indeed the Eurogroup
p40
aVare wrong in believing that we can dispense with democracy \u2014
p41
aVthat we need an authentic, boisterous democracy.
p42
aVAnd without democracy,
p43
aVour societies will be nastier,
p44
aVour future bleak
p45
aVand our great, new technologies wasted.
p46
aa(lp47
VSpeaking of waste,
p48
aVallow me to point out an interesting paradox
p49
aVthat is threatening our economies as we speak.
p50
aVI call it the twin peaks paradox.
p51
aVOne peak you understand \u2014
p52
aVyou know it, you recognize it \u2014
p53
aVis the mountain of debts that has been casting a long shadow
p54
aVover the United States, Europe, the whole world.
p55
aVWe all recognize the mountain of debts.
p56
aVBut few people discern its twin.
p57
aVA mountain of idle cash
p58
aVbelonging to rich savers and to corporations,
p59
aVtoo terrified to invest it
p60
aVinto the productive activities that can generate the incomes
p61
aVfrom which you can extinguish the mountain of debts
p62
aVand which can produce all those things that humanity desperately needs,
p63
aVlike green energy.
p64
aa(lp65
VNow let me give you two numbers.
p66
aVOver the last three months,
p67
aVin the United States, in Britain and in the Eurozone,
p68
aVwe have invested, collectively, 3.4 trillion dollars
p69
aVon all the wealth-producing goods \u2014
p70
aVthings like industrial plants, machinery,
p71
aVoffice blocks, schools,
p72
aVroads, railways, machinery, and so on and so forth.
p73
aV$3.4 trillion sounds like a lot of money
p74
aVuntil you compare it to the $5.1 trillion
p75
aVthat has been slushing around in the same countries,
p76
aVin our financial institutions,
p77
aVdoing absolutely nothing during the same period
p78
aVexcept inflating stock exchanges and bidding up house prices.
p79
aa(lp80
VSo a mountain of debt and a mountain of idle cash
p81
aVform twin peaks,  failing to cancel each other out
p82
aVthrough the normal operation of the markets.
p83
aa(lp84
VThe result is stagnant wages,
p85
aVmore than a quarter of 25- to 54-year-olds in America, in Japan and in Europe
p86
aVout of work.
p87
aVAnd consequently, low aggregate demand,
p88
aVwhich in a never-ending cycle,
p89
aVreinforces the pessimism of the investors,
p90
aVwho, fearing low demand, reproduce it by not investing \u2014
p91
aVexactly like Oedipus' father,
p92
aVwho, terrified by the prophecy of the oracle
p93
aVthat his son would grow up to kill him,
p94
aVunwittingly engineered the conditions
p95
aVthat ensured that Oedipus, his son, would kill him.
p96
aa(lp97
VThis is my quarrel with capitalism.
p98
aVIts gross wastefulness,
p99
aVall this idle cash,
p100
aVshould be energized to improve lives,
p101
aVto develop human talents,
p102
aVand indeed to finance all these technologies,
p103
aVgreen technologies,
p104
aVwhich are absolutely essential for saving planet Earth.
p105
aa(lp106
VAm I right in believing that democracy might be the answer?
p107
aVI believe so,
p108
aVbut before we move on,
p109
aVwhat do we mean by democracy?
p110
aVAristotle defined democracy
p111
aVas the constitution in which the free and the poor,
p112
aVbeing in the majority, control government.
p113
aa(lp114
VNow, of course Athenian democracy excluded too many.
p115
aVWomen, migrants and, of course, the slaves.
p116
aVBut it would be a mistake
p117
aVto dismiss the significance of ancient Athenian democracy
p118
aVon the basis of whom it excluded.
p119
aa(lp120
VWhat was more pertinent,
p121
aVand continues to be so about ancient Athenian democracy,
p122
aVwas the inclusion of the working poor,
p123
aVwho not only acquired the right to free speech,
p124
aVbut more importantly, crucially,
p125
aVthey acquired the rights to political judgments
p126
aVthat were afforded equal weight
p127
aVin the decision-making concerning matters of state.
p128
aVNow, of course, Athenian democracy didn't last long.
p129
aVLike a candle that burns brightly, it burned out quickly.
p130
aVAnd indeed,
p131
aVour liberal democracies today do not have their roots in ancient Athens.
p132
aVThey have their roots in the Magna Carta,
p133
aVin the 1688 Glorious Revolution,
p134
aVindeed in the American constitution.
p135
aVWhereas Athenian democracy was focusing on the masterless citizen
p136
aVand empowering the working poor,
p137
aVour liberal democracies are founded on the Magna Carta tradition,
p138
aVwhich was, after all, a charter for masters.
p139
aVAnd indeed, liberal democracy only surfaced when it was possible
p140
aVto separate fully the political sphere from the economic sphere,
p141
aVso as to confine the democratic process fully in the political sphere,
p142
aVleaving the economic sphere \u2014
p143
aVthe corporate world, if you want \u2014
p144
aVas a democracy-free zone.
p145
aa(lp146
VNow, in our democracies today,
p147
aVthis separation of the economic from the political sphere,
p148
aVthe moment it started happening,
p149
aVit gave rise to an inexorable, epic struggle between the two,
p150
aVwith the economic sphere colonizing the political sphere,
p151
aVeating into its power.
p152
aa(lp153
VHave you wondered why politicians are not what they used to be?
p154
aVIt's not because their DNA has degenerated.
p155
aa(lp156
V(Laughter)
p157
aa(lp158
VIt is rather because one can be in government today and not in power,
p159
aVbecause power has migrated from the political to the economic sphere,
p160
aVwhich is separate.
p161
aa(lp162
VIndeed,
p163
aVI spoke about my quarrel with capitalism.
p164
aVIf you think about it,
p165
aVit is a little bit like a population of predators,
p166
aVthat are so successful in decimating the prey that they must feed on,
p167
aVthat in the end they starve.
p168
aa(lp169
VSimilarly,
p170
aVthe economic sphere has been colonizing and cannibalizing the political sphere
p171
aVto such an extent that it is undermining itself,
p172
aVcausing economic crisis.
p173
aVCorporate power is increasing,
p174
aVpolitical goods are devaluing,
p175
aVinequality is rising,
p176
aVaggregate demand is falling
p177
aVand CEOs of corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their corporations.
p178
aa(lp179
VSo the more capitalism succeeds in taking the demos out of democracy,
p180
aVthe taller the twin peaks
p181
aVand the greater the waste of human resources
p182
aVand humanity's wealth.
p183
aa(lp184
VClearly, if this is right,
p185
aVwe must reunite the political and economic spheres
p186
aVand better do it with a demos being in control,
p187
aVlike in ancient Athens except without the slaves
p188
aVor the exclusion of women and migrants.
p189
aa(lp190
VNow, this is not an original idea.
p191
aVThe Marxist left had that idea 100 years ago
p192
aVand it didn't go very well, did it?
p193
aa(lp194
VThe lesson that we learned from the Soviet debacle
p195
aVis that only by a miracle will the working poor be reempowered,
p196
aVas they were in ancient Athens,
p197
aVwithout creating new forms of brutality and waste.
p198
aa(lp199
VBut there is a solution:
p200
aVeliminate the working poor.
p201
aVCapitalism's doing it
p202
aVby replacing low-wage workers with automata, androids, robots.
p203
aVThe problem is
p204
aVthat as long as the economic and the political spheres are separate,
p205
aVautomation makes the twin peaks taller,
p206
aVthe waste loftier
p207
aVand the social conflicts deeper,
p208
aVincluding \u2014
p209
aVsoon, I believe \u2014
p210
aVin places like China.
p211
aa(lp212
VSo we need to reconfigure,
p213
aVwe need to reunite the economic and the political spheres,
p214
aVbut we'd better do it by democratizing the reunified sphere,
p215
aVlest we end up with a surveillance-mad hyperautocracy
p216
aVthat makes The Matrix, the movie, look like a documentary.
p217
aa(lp218
V(Laughter)
p219
aa(lp220
VSo the question is not whether capitalism will survive
p221
aVthe technological innovations it is spawning.
p222
aVThe more interesting question
p223
aVis whether capitalism will be succeeded by something resembling a Matrix dystopia
p224
aVor something much closer to a Star Trek-like society,
p225
aVwhere machines serve the humans
p226
aVand the humans expend their energies exploring the universe
p227
aVand indulging in long debates about the meaning of life
p228
aVin some ancient, Athenian-like, high tech agora.
p229
aa(lp230
VI think we can afford to be optimistic.
p231
aVBut what would it take,
p232
aVwhat would it look like
p233
aVto have this Star Trek-like utopia, instead of the Matrix-like dystopia?
p234
aa(lp235
VIn practical terms,
p236
aVallow me to share just briefly,
p237
aVa couple of examples.
p238
aa(lp239
VAt the level of the enterprise,
p240
aVimagine a capital market,
p241
aVwhere you earn capital as you work,
p242
aVand where your capital follows you from one job to another,
p243
aVfrom one company to another,
p244
aVand the company \u2014
p245
aVwhichever one you happen to work at at that time \u2014
p246
aVis solely owned by those who happen to work in it at that moment.
p247
aVThen all income stems from capital, from profits,
p248
aVand the very concept of wage labor becomes obsolete.
p249
aVNo more separation between those who own but do not work in the company
p250
aVand those who work but do not own the company;
p251
aVno more tug-of-war between capital and labor;
p252
aVno great gap between investment and saving;
p253
aVindeed, no towering twin peaks.
p254
aa(lp255
VAt the level of the global political economy,
p256
aVimagine for a moment
p257
aVthat our national currencies have a free-floating exchange rate,
p258
aVwith a universal, global, digital currency,
p259
aVone that is issued by the International Monetary Fund,
p260
aVthe G-20,
p261
aVon behalf of all humanity.
p262
aVAnd imagine further
p263
aVthat all international trade is denominated in this currency \u2014
p264
aVlet's call it "the cosmos,"
p265
aVin units of cosmos \u2014
p266
aVwith every government agreeing to be paying into a common fund
p267
aVa sum of cosmos units proportional to the country's trade deficit,
p268
aVor indeed to a country's trade surplus.
p269
aVAnd imagine that that fund is utilized to invest in green technologies,
p270
aVespecially in parts of the world where investment funding is scarce.
p271
aa(lp272
VThis is not a new idea.
p273
aVIt's what, effectively, John Maynard Keynes proposed
p274
aVin 1944 at the Bretton Woods Conference.
p275
aVThe problem is
p276
aVthat back then, they didn't have the technology to implement it.
p277
aVNow we do,
p278
aVespecially in the context of a reunified political-economic sphere.
p279
aa(lp280
VThe world that I am describing to you
p281
aVis simultaneously libertarian,
p282
aVin that it prioritizes empowered individuals,
p283
aVMarxist,
p284
aVsince it will have confined to the dustbin of history
p285
aVthe division between capital and labor,
p286
aVand Keynesian,
p287
aVglobal Keynesian.
p288
aVBut above all else,
p289
aVit is a world in which we will be able to imagine an authentic democracy.
p290
aa(lp291
VWill such a world dawn?
p292
aVOr shall we descend into a Matrix-like dystopia?
p293
aVThe answer lies in the political choice that we shall be making collectively.
p294
aVIt is our choice,
p295
aVand we'd better make it democratically.
p296
aa(lp297
VThank you.
p298
aa(lp299
V(Applause)
p300
aa(lp301
VBruno Giussani: Yanis ...
p302
aVIt was you who described yourself in your bios as a libertarian Marxist.
p303
aVWhat is the relevance of Marx's analysis today?
p304
aa(lp305
VYanis Varoufakis: Well, if there was any relevance in what I just said,
p306
aVthen Marx is relevant.
p307
aVBecause the whole point of reunifying the political and economic is \u2014
p308
aVif we don't do it,
p309
aVthen technological innovation is going to create
p310
aVsuch a massive fall in aggregate demand,
p311
aa(lp312
Vwhat Larry Summers refers to as secular stagnation.
p313
aVWith this crisis migrating from one part of the world,
p314
aVas it is now,
p315
aVit will destabilize not only our democracies,
p316
aVbut even the emerging world that is not that keen on liberal democracy.
p317
aVSo if this analysis holds water, then Marx is absolutely relevant.
p318
aVBut so is Hayek,
p319
aVthat's why I'm a libertarian Marxist,
p320
aVand so is Keynes,
p321
aVso that's why I'm totally confused.
p322
aa(lp323
V(Laughter)
p324
aa(lp325
VBG: Indeed, and possibly we are too, now.
p326
aa(lp327
V(Laughter)
p328
aa(lp329
V(Applause)
p330
aa(lp331
VYV: If you are not confused, you are not thinking, OK?
p332
aa(lp333
VBG: That's a very, very Greek philosopher kind of thing to say \u2014
p334
aa(lp335
VYV: That was Einstein, actually \u2014
p336
aa(lp337
VBG: During your talk you mentioned Singapore and China,
p338
aVand last night at the speaker dinner,
p339
aVyou expressed a pretty strong opinion about how the West looks at China.
p340
aVWould you like to share that?
p341
aa(lp342
VYV: Well, there's a great degree of hypocrisy.
p343
aVIn our liberal democracies, we have a semblance of democracy.
p344
aVIt's because we have confined, as I was saying in my talk,
p345
aVdemocracy to the political sphere,
p346
aVwhile leaving the one sphere where all the action is \u2014
p347
aVthe economic sphere \u2014
p348
aVa completely democracy-free zone.
p349
aa(lp350
VIn a sense,
p351
aVif I am allowed to be provocative,
p352
aVChina today is closer to Britain in the 19th century.
p353
aVBecause remember,
p354
aVwe tend to associate liberalism with democracy \u2014
p355
aVthat's a mistake, historically.
p356
aVLiberalism, liberal, it's like John Stuart Mill.
p357
aVJohn Stuart Mill was particularly skeptical about the democratic process.
p358
aVSo what you are seeing now in China is a very similar process
p359
aVto the one that we had in Britain during the Industrial Revolution,
p360
aVespecially the transition from the first to the second.
p361
aVAnd to be castigating China
p362
aVfor doing that which the West did in the 19th century,
p363
aVsmacks of hypocrisy.
p364
aa(lp365
VBG: I am sure that many people here are wondering about your experience
p366
aVas the Finance Minister of Greece earlier this year.
p367
aa(lp368
VYV: I knew this was coming.
p369
aa(lp370
VBG: Yes.
p371
aa(lp372
VBG: Six months after,
p373
aVhow do you look back at the first half of the year?
p374
aa(lp375
VYV: Extremely exciting, from a personal point of view,
p376
aVand very disappointing,
p377
aVbecause we had an opportunity to reboot the Eurozone.
p378
aVNot just Greece, the Eurozone.
p379
aVTo move away from the complacency
p380
aVand the constant denial that there was a massive \u2014
p381
aVand there is a massive architectural fault line
p382
aVgoing through the Eurozone,
p383
aVwhich is threatening, massively, the whole of the European Union process.
p384
aa(lp385
VWe had an opportunity on the basis of the Greek program \u2014
p386
aVwhich by the way,
p387
aVwas the first program to manifest that denial \u2014
p388
aVto put it right.
p389
aVAnd, unfortunately,
p390
aVthe powers in the Eurozone,
p391
aVin the Eurogroup,
p392
aVchose to maintain denial.
p393
aa(lp394
VBut you know what happens.
p395
aVThis is the experience of the Soviet Union.
p396
aVWhen you try to keep alive
p397
aVan economic system that architecturally cannot survive,
p398
aVthrough political will and through authoritarianism,
p399
aVyou may succeed in prolonging it,
p400
aVbut when change happens
p401
aVit happens very abruptly and catastrophically.
p402
aa(lp403
VBG: What kind of change are you foreseeing?
p404
aa(lp405
VYV: Well, there's no doubt
p406
aVthat if we don't change the architecture of the Eurozone,
p407
aVthe Eurozone has no future.
p408
aa(lp409
VBG: Did you make any mistakes when you were Finance Minister?
p410
aa(lp411
VYV: Every day.
p412
aa(lp413
VBG: For example? YV: Anybody who looks back \u2014
p414
aa(lp415
V(Applause)
p416
aa(lp417
VNo, but seriously.
p418
aVIf there's any Minister of Finance, or of anything else for that matter,
p419
aVwho tells you after six months in a job,
p420
aVespecially in such a stressful situation,
p421
aVthat they have made no mistake, they're dangerous people.
p422
aVOf course I made mistakes.
p423
aa(lp424
VThe greatest mistake was to sign the application
p425
aVfor the extension of a loan agreement
p426
aVin the end of February.
p427
aVI was imagining
p428
aVthat there was a genuine interest on the side of the creditors
p429
aVto find common ground.
p430
aVAnd there wasn't.
p431
aVThey were simply interested in crushing our government,
p432
aVjust because they did not want
p433
aVto have to deal with the architectural fault lines
p434
aVthat were running through the Eurozone.
p435
aVAnd because they didn't want to admit
p436
aVthat for five years they were implementing a catastrophic program in Greece.
p437
aVWe lost one-third of our nominal GDP.
p438
aVThis is worse than the Great Depression.
p439
aVAnd no one has come clean
p440
aVfrom the troika of lenders that have been imposing this policy
p441
aVto say, "This was a colossal mistake."
p442
aa(lp443
VBG: Despite all this,
p444
aVand despite the aggressiveness of the discussion,
p445
aVyou seem to be remaining quite pro-European.
p446
aa(lp447
VYV: Absolutely.
p448
aVLook, my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone
p449
aVcomes from a person who lives and breathes Europe.
p450
aVMy greatest fear is that the Eurozone will not survive.
p451
aVBecause if it doesn't,
p452
aVthe centrifugal forces that will be unleashed
p453
aVwill be demonic,
p454
aVand they will destroy the European Union.
p455
aVAnd that will be catastrophic not just for Europe
p456
aVbut for the whole global economy.
p457
aa(lp458
VWe are probably the largest economy in the world.
p459
aVAnd if we allow ourselves
p460
aVto fall into a route of the postmodern 1930's,
p461
aVwhich seems to me to be what we are doing,
p462
aVthen that will be detrimental
p463
aVto the future of Europeans and non-Europeans alike.
p464
aa(lp465
VBG: We definitely hope you are wrong on that point.
p466
aVYanis, thank you for coming to TED.
