VSpace, the final frontier.
p4
aa(lp5
VI first heard these words when I was just six years old,
p6
aVand I was completely inspired.
p7
aVI wanted to explore strange new worlds.
p8
aVI wanted to seek out new life.
p9
aVI wanted to see everything that the universe had to offer.
p10
aVAnd those dreams, those words, they took me on a journey,
p11
aVa journey of discovery,
p12
aVthrough school, through university,
p13
aVto do a PhD and finally to become a professional astronomer.
p14
aVNow, I learned two amazing things,
p15
aVone slightly unfortunate,
p16
aVwhen I was doing my PhD.
p17
aVI learned that the reality was
p18
aVI wouldn't be piloting a starship anytime soon.
p19
aVBut I also learned that the universe is strange, wonderful and vast,
p20
aVactually too vast to be explored by spaceship.
p21
aVAnd so I turned my attention to astronomy, to using telescopes.
p22
aa(lp23
VNow, I show you before you an image of the night sky.
p24
aVYou might see it anywhere in the world.
p25
aVAnd all of these stars are part of our local galaxy, the Milky Way.
p26
aVNow, if you were to go to a darker part of the sky,
p27
aVa nice dark site, perhaps in the desert,
p28
aVyou might see the center of our Milky Way galaxy
p29
aVspread out before you, hundreds of billions of stars.
p30
aVAnd it's a very beautiful image.
p31
aVIt's colorful.
p32
aVAnd again, this is just a local corner of our universe.
p33
aVYou can see there's a sort of strange dark dust across it.
p34
aVNow, that is local dust
p35
aVthat's obscuring the light of the stars.
p36
aVBut we can do a pretty good job.
p37
aVJust with our own eyes, we can explore our little corner of the universe.
p38
aVIt's possible to do better.
p39
aVYou can use wonderful telescopes like the Hubble Space Telescope.
p40
aVNow, astronomers have put together this image.
p41
aVIt's called the Hubble Deep Field,
p42
aVand they've spent hundreds of hours observing just a tiny patch of the sky
p43
aVno larger than your thumbnail held at arm's length.
p44
aVAnd in this image
p45
aVyou can see thousands of galaxies,
p46
aVand we know that there must be hundreds of millions, billions of galaxies
p47
aVin the entire universe,
p48
aVsome like our own and some very different.
p49
aVSo you think, OK, well, I can continue this journey.
p50
aVThis is easy. I can just use a very powerful telescope
p51
aVand just look at the sky, no problem.
p52
aVIt's actually really missing out if we just do that.
p53
aVNow, that's because everything I've talked about so far
p54
aVis just using the visible spectrum, just the thing that your eyes can see,
p55
aVand that's a tiny slice,
p56
aVa tiny, tiny slice of what the universe has to offer us.
p57
aVNow, there's also two very important problems with using visible light.
p58
aVNot only are we missing out on all the other processes
p59
aVthat are emitting other kinds of light,
p60
aVbut there's two issues.
p61
aa(lp62
VNow, the first is that dust that I mentioned earlier.
p63
aVThe dust stops the visible light from getting to us.
p64
aVSo as we look deeper into the universe, we see less light.
p65
aVThe dust stops it getting to us.
p66
aVBut there's a really strange problem with using visible light
p67
aVin order to try and explore the universe.
p68
aa(lp69
VNow take a break for a minute.
p70
aVSay you're standing on a corner, a busy street corner.
p71
aVThere's cars going by.
p72
aVAn ambulance approaches.
p73
aVIt has a high-pitched siren.
p74
aa(lp75
V(Imitates a siren passing by)
p76
aa(lp77
VThe siren appeared to change in pitch
p78
aVas it moved towards and away from you.
p79
aVThe ambulance driver did not change the siren just to mess with you.
p80
aVThat was a product of your perception.
p81
aVThe sound waves, as the ambulance approached,
p82
aVwere compressed,
p83
aVand they changed higher in pitch.
p84
aVAs the ambulance receded, the sound waves were stretched,
p85
aVand they sounded lower in pitch.
p86
aVThe same thing happens with light.
p87
aVObjects moving towards us,
p88
aVtheir light waves are compressed and they appear bluer.
p89
aVObjects moving away from us,
p90
aVtheir light waves are stretched, and they appear redder.
p91
aVSo we call these effects blueshift and redshift.
p92
aa(lp93
VNow, our universe is expanding,
p94
aVso everything is moving away from everything else,
p95
aVand that means everything appears to be red.
p96
aVAnd oddly enough, as you look more deeply into the universe,
p97
aVmore distant objects are moving away further and faster,
p98
aVso they appear more red.
p99
aVSo if I come back to the Hubble Deep Field
p100
aVand we were to continue to peer deeply into the universe
p101
aVjust using the Hubble,
p102
aVas we get to a certain distance away,
p103
aVeverything becomes red,
p104
aVand that presents something of a problem.
p105
aVEventually, we get so far away
p106
aVeverything is shifted into the infrared
p107
aVand we can't see anything at all.
p108
aa(lp109
VSo there must be a way around this.
p110
aVOtherwise, I'm limited in my journey.
p111
aVI wanted to explore the whole universe,
p112
aVnot just whatever I can see, you know, before the redshift kicks in.
p113
aVThere is a technique.
p114
aVIt's called radio astronomy.
p115
aVAstronomers have been using this for decades.
p116
aVIt's a fantastic technique.
p117
aVI show you the Parkes Radio Telescope, affectionately known as "The Dish."
p118
aVYou may have seen the movie.
p119
aVAnd radio is really brilliant.
p120
aVIt allows us to peer much more deeply.
p121
aVIt doesn't get stopped by dust,
p122
aVso you can see everything in the universe,
p123
aVand redshift is less of a problem
p124
aVbecause we can build receivers that receive across a large band.
p125
aa(lp126
VSo what does Parkes see when we turn it to the center of the Milky Way?
p127
aVWe should see something fantastic, right?
p128
aVWell, we do see something interesting.
p129
aVAll that dust has gone.
p130
aVAs I mentioned, radio goes straight through dust, so not a problem.
p131
aVBut the view is very different.
p132
aVWe can see that the center of the Milky Way is aglow,
p133
aVand this isn't starlight.
p134
aVThis is a light called synchrotron radiation,
p135
aVand it's formed from electrons spiraling around cosmic magnetic fields.
p136
aVSo the plane is aglow with this light.
p137
aVAnd we can also see strange tufts coming off of it,
p138
aVand objects which don't appear to line up
p139
aVwith anything that we can see with our own eyes.
p140
aVBut it's hard to really interpret this image,
p141
aVbecause as you can see, it's very low resolution.
p142
aVRadio waves have a wavelength that's long,
p143
aVand that makes their resolution poorer.
p144
aVThis image is also black and white,
p145
aVso we don't really know what is the color of everything in here.
p146
aa(lp147
VWell, fast-forward to today.
p148
aVWe can build telescopes
p149
aVwhich can get over these problems.
p150
aVNow, I'm showing you here an image of the Murchison Radio Observatory,
p151
aVa fantastic place to build radio telescopes.
p152
aVIt's flat, it's dry,
p153
aVand most importantly, it's radio quiet:
p154
aVno mobile phones, no Wi-Fi, nothing,
p155
aVjust very, very radio quiet,
p156
aVso a perfect place to build a radio telescope.
p157
aVNow, the telescope that I've been working on for a few years
p158
aVis called the Murchison Widefield Array,
p159
aVand I'm going to show you a little time lapse of it being built.
p160
aVThis is a group of undergraduate and postgraduate students
p161
aVlocated in Perth.
p162
aVWe call them the Student Army,
p163
aVand they volunteered their time to build a radio telescope.
p164
aVThere's no course credit for this.
p165
aVAnd they're putting together these radio dipoles.
p166
aVThey just receive at low frequencies, a bit like your FM radio or your TV.
p167
aVAnd here we are deploying them across the desert.
p168
aVThe final telescope covers 10 square kilometers
p169
aVof the Western Australian desert.
p170
aVAnd the interesting thing is, there's no moving parts.
p171
aVWe just deploy these little antennas
p172
aVessentially on chicken mesh.
p173
aVIt's fairly cheap.
p174
aVCables take the signals
p175
aVfrom the antennas
p176
aVand bring them to central processing units.
p177
aVAnd it's the size of this telescope,
p178
aVthe fact that we've built it over the entire desert
p179
aVthat gives us a better resolution than Parkes.
p180
aa(lp181
VNow, eventually all those cables bring them to a unit
p182
aVwhich sends it off to a supercomputer here in Perth,
p183
aVand that's where I come in.
p184
aa(lp185
V(Sighs)
p186
aa(lp187
VRadio data.
p188
aVI have spent the last five years
p189
aVworking with very difficult, very interesting data
p190
aVthat no one had really looked at before.
p191
aVI've spent a long time calibrating it,
p192
aVrunning millions of CPU hours on supercomputers
p193
aVand really trying to understand that data.
p194
aVAnd with this telescope,
p195
aVwith this data,
p196
aVwe've performed a survey of the entire southern sky,
p197
aVthe GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA Survey,
p198
aVor GLEAM, as I call it.
p199
aVAnd I'm very excited.
p200
aVThis survey is just about to be published, but it hasn't been shown yet,
p201
aVso you are literally the first people
p202
aVto see this southern survey of the entire sky.
p203
aVSo I'm delighted to share with you some images from this survey.
p204
aa(lp205
VNow, imagine you went to the Murchison,
p206
aVyou camped out underneath the stars
p207
aVand you looked towards the south.
p208
aVYou saw the south's celestial pole,
p209
aVthe galaxy rising.
p210
aVIf I fade in the radio light,
p211
aVthis is what we observe with our survey.
p212
aVYou can see that the galactic plane is no longer dark with dust.
p213
aVIt's alight with synchrotron radiation,
p214
aVand thousands of dots are in the sky.
p215
aVOur large Magellanic Cloud, our nearest galactic neighbor,
p216
aVis orange instead of its more familiar blue-white.
p217
aa(lp218
VSo there's a lot going on in this. Let's take a closer look.
p219
aVIf we look back towards the galactic center,
p220
aVwhere we originally saw the Parkes image that I showed you earlier,
p221
aVlow resolution, black and white,
p222
aVand we fade to the GLEAM view,
p223
aVyou can see the resolution has gone up by a factor of a hundred.
p224
aVWe now have a color view of the sky,
p225
aVa technicolor view.
p226
aVNow, it's not a false color view.
p227
aVThese are real radio colors.
p228
aVWhat I've done is I've colored the lowest frequencies red
p229
aVand the highest frequencies blue,
p230
aVand the middle ones green.
p231
aVAnd that gives us this rainbow view.
p232
aVAnd this isn't just false color.
p233
aVThe colors in this image tell us about the physical processes
p234
aVgoing on in the universe.
p235
aVSo for instance, if you look along the plane of the galaxy,
p236
aVit's alight with synchrotron,
p237
aVwhich is mostly reddish orange,
p238
aVbut if we look very closely, we see little blue dots.
p239
aVNow, if we zoom in,
p240
aVthese blue dots are ionized plasma
p241
aVaround very bright stars,
p242
aVand what happens is that they block the red light,
p243
aVso they appear blue.
p244
aVAnd these can tell us about these star-forming regions
p245
aVin our galaxy.
p246
aVAnd we just see them immediately.
p247
aVWe look at the galaxy, and the color tells us that they're there.
p248
aa(lp249
VYou can see little soap bubbles,
p250
aVlittle circular images around the galactic plane,
p251
aVand these are supernova remnants.
p252
aVWhen a star explodes,
p253
aVits outer shell is cast off
p254
aVand it travels outward into space gathering up material,
p255
aVand it produces a little shell.
p256
aVIt's been a long-standing mystery to astronomers
p257
aVwhere all the supernova remnants are.
p258
aVWe know that there must be a lot of high-energy electrons in the plane
p259
aVto produce the synchrotron radiation that we see,
p260
aVand we think they're produced by supernova remnants,
p261
aVbut there don't seem to be enough.
p262
aVFortunately, GLEAM is really, really good at detecting supernova remnants,
p263
aVso we're hoping to have a new paper out on that soon.
p264
aa(lp265
VNow, that's fine.
p266
aVWe've explored our little local universe,
p267
aVbut I wanted to go deeper, I wanted to go further.
p268
aVI wanted to go beyond the Milky Way.
p269
aVWell, as it happens, we can see a very interesting object in the top right,
p270
aVand this is a local radio galaxy,
p271
aVCentaurus A.
p272
aVIf we zoom in on this,
p273
aVwe can see that there are two huge plumes going out into space.
p274
aVAnd if you look right in the center between those two plumes,
p275
aVyou'll see a galaxy just like our own.
p276
aVIt's a spiral. It has a dust lane.
p277
aVIt's a normal galaxy.
p278
aVBut these jets are only visible in the radio.
p279
aVIf we looked in the visible, we wouldn't even know they were there,
p280
aVand they're thousands of times larger than the host galaxy.
p281
aa(lp282
VWhat's going on? What's producing these jets?
p283
aVAt the center of every galaxy that we know about
p284
aVis a supermassive black hole.
p285
aVNow, black holes are invisible. That's why they're called that.
p286
aVAll you can see is the deflection of the light around them,
p287
aVand occasionally, when a star or a cloud of gas comes into their orbit,
p288
aVit is ripped apart by tidal forces,
p289
aVforming what we call an accretion disk.
p290
aVThe accretion disk glows brightly in the x-rays,
p291
aVand huge magnetic fields can launch the material into space
p292
aVat nearly the speed of light.
p293
aVSo these jets are visible in the radio
p294
aVand this is what we pick up in our survey.
p295
aa(lp296
VWell, very well, so we've seen one radio galaxy. That's nice.
p297
aVBut if you just look at the top of that image,
p298
aVyou'll see another radio galaxy.
p299
aVIt's a little bit smaller, and that's just because it's further away.
p300
aVOK. Two radio galaxies.
p301
aVWe can see this. This is fine.
p302
aVWell, what about all the other dots?
p303
aVPresumably those are just stars.
p304
aVThey're not.
p305
aVThey're all radio galaxies.
p306
aVEvery single one of the dots in this image
p307
aVis a distant galaxy,
p308
aVmillions to billions of light-years away
p309
aVwith a supermassive black hole at its center
p310
aVpushing material into space at nearly the speed of light.
p311
aVIt is mind-blowing.
p312
aVAnd this survey is even larger than what I've shown here.
p313
aVIf we zoom out to the full extent of the survey,
p314
aVyou can see I found 300,000 of these radio galaxies.
p315
aVSo it's truly an epic journey.
p316
aVWe've discovered all of these galaxies
p317
aVright back to the very first supermassive black holes.
p318
aVI'm very proud of this, and it will be published next week.
p319
aa(lp320
VNow, that's not all.
p321
aVI've explored the furthest reaches of the galaxy with this survey,
p322
aVbut there's something even more in this image.
p323
aVNow, I'll take you right back to the dawn of time.
p324
aVWhen the universe formed, it was a big bang,
p325
aVwhich left the universe as a sea of hydrogen,
p326
aVneutral hydrogen.
p327
aVAnd when the very first stars and galaxies switched on,
p328
aVthey ionized that hydrogen.
p329
aVSo the universe went from neutral to ionized.
p330
aVThat imprinted a signal all around us.
p331
aVEverywhere, it pervades us,
p332
aVlike the Force.
p333
aVNow, because that happened so long ago,
p334
aVthe signal was redshifted,
p335
aVso now that signal is at very low frequencies.
p336
aVIt's at the same frequency as my survey,
p337
aVbut it's so faint.
p338
aVIt's a billionth the size of any of the objects in my survey.
p339
aVSo our telescope may not be quite sensitive enough to pick up this signal.
p340
aVHowever, there's a new radio telescope.
p341
aVSo I can't have a starship,
p342
aVbut I can hopefully have
p343
aVone of the biggest radio telescopes in the world.
p344
aVWe're building the Square Kilometre Array, a new radio telescope,
p345
aVand it's going to be a thousand times bigger than the MWA,
p346
aVa thousand times more sensitive, and have an even better resolution.
p347
aVSo we should find tens of millions of galaxies.
p348
aVAnd perhaps, deep in that signal,
p349
aVI will get to look upon the very first stars and galaxies switching on,
p350
aVthe beginning of time itself.
