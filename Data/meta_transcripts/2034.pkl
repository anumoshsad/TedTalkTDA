VThe human voice:
p4
aVIt's the instrument we all play.
p5
aVIt's the most powerful sound in the world, probably.
p6
aVIt's the only one that can start a war or say "I love you."
p7
aVAnd yet many people have the experience
p8
aVthat when they speak, people don't listen to them.
p9
aVAnd why is that?
p10
aVHow can we speak powerfully to make change in the world?
p11
aa(lp12
VWhat I'd like to suggest,
p13
aVthere are a number of habits that we need to move away from.
p14
aVI've assembled for your pleasure here seven deadly sins of speaking.
p15
aVI'm not pretending this is an exhaustive list,
p16
aVbut these seven, I think, are pretty large habits that we can all fall into.
p17
aa(lp18
VFirst, gossip.
p19
aVSpeaking ill of somebody who's not present.
p20
aVNot a nice habit, and we know perfectly well
p21
aVthe person gossiping, five minutes later, will be gossiping about us.
p22
aa(lp23
VSecond, judging.
p24
aVWe know people who are like this in conversation,
p25
aVand it's very hard to listen to somebody
p26
aVif you know that you're being judged and found wanting at the same time.
p27
aa(lp28
VThird, negativity.
p29
aVYou can fall into this.
p30
aVMy mother, in the last years of her life, became very negative,
p31
aVand it's hard to listen.
p32
aVI remember one day, I said to her, "It's October 1 today,"
p33
aVand she said, "I know, isn't it dreadful?"
p34
aa(lp35
V(Laughter)
p36
aa(lp37
VIt's hard to listen when somebody's that negative.
p38
aa(lp39
V(Laughter)
p40
aa(lp41
VAnd another form of negativity, complaining.
p42
aVWell, this is the national art of the U.K.
p43
aVIt's our national sport.
p44
aVWe complain about the weather, sport, about politics, about everything,
p45
aVbut actually, complaining is viral misery.
p46
aVIt's not spreading sunshine and lightness in the world.
p47
aa(lp48
VExcuses.
p49
aa(lp50
VWe've all met this guy.
p51
aVMaybe we've all been this guy.
p52
aVSome people have a blamethrower.
p53
aVThey just pass it on to everybody else
p54
aVand don't take responsibility for their actions,
p55
aVand again, hard to listen to somebody who is being like that.
p56
aa(lp57
VPenultimate, the sixth of the seven,
p58
aVembroidery, exaggeration.
p59
aVIt demeans our language, actually, sometimes.
p60
aVFor example, if I see something that really is awesome,
p61
aVwhat do I call it?
p62
aa(lp63
V(Laughter)
p64
aa(lp65
VAnd then, of course, this exaggeration becomes lying,
p66
aVand we don't want to listen to people we know are lying to us.
p67
aa(lp68
VAnd finally, dogmatism.
p69
aVThe confusion of facts with opinions.
p70
aVWhen those two things get conflated,
p71
aVyou're listening into the wind.
p72
aVYou know, somebody is bombarding you with their opinions as if they were true.
p73
aVIt's difficult to listen to that.
p74
aa(lp75
VSo here they are, seven deadly sins of speaking.
p76
aVThese are things I think we need to avoid.
p77
aVBut is there a positive way to think about this?
p78
aVYes, there is.
p79
aVI'd like to suggest that there are four really powerful cornerstones, foundations,
p80
aVthat we can stand on if we want our speech
p81
aVto be powerful and to make change in the world.
p82
aVFortunately, these things spell a word.
p83
aVThe word is "hail," and it has a great definition as well.
p84
aVI'm not talking about the stuff that falls from the sky
p85
aVand hits you on the head.
p86
aVI'm talking about this definition,
p87
aVto greet or acclaim enthusiastically,
p88
aVwhich is how I think our words will be received
p89
aVif we stand on these four things.
p90
aa(lp91
VSo what do they stand for?
p92
aVSee if you can guess.
p93
aVThe H, honesty, of course,
p94
aVbeing true in what you say, being straight and clear.
p95
aVThe A is authenticity, just being yourself.
p96
aVA friend of mine described it as standing in your own truth,
p97
aVwhich I think is a lovely way to put it.
p98
aVThe I is integrity, being your word,
p99
aVactually doing what you say,
p100
aVand being somebody people can trust.
p101
aVAnd the L is love.
p102
aVI don't mean romantic love,
p103
aVbut I do mean wishing people well, for two reasons.
p104
aVFirst of all, I think absolute honesty may not be what we want.
p105
aVI mean, my goodness, you look ugly this morning.
p106
aVPerhaps that's not necessary.
p107
aVTempered with love, of course, honesty is a great thing.
p108
aVBut also, if you're really wishing somebody well,
p109
aVit's very hard to judge them at the same time.
p110
aVI'm not even sure you can do those two things simultaneously.
p111
aVSo hail.
p112
aa(lp113
VAlso, now that's what you say,
p114
aVand it's like the old song, it is what you say,
p115
aVit's also the way that you say it.
p116
aVYou have an amazing toolbox.
p117
aVThis instrument is incredible,
p118
aVand yet this is a toolbox that very few people have ever opened.
p119
aVI'd like to have a little rummage in there with you now
p120
aVand just pull a few tools out
p121
aVthat you might like to take away and play with,
p122
aVwhich will increase the power of your speaking.
p123
aa(lp124
VRegister, for example.
p125
aVNow, falsetto register may not be very useful most of the time,
p126
aVbut there's a register in between.
p127
aVI'm not going to get very technical about this
p128
aVfor any of you who are voice coaches.
p129
aVYou can locate your voice, however.
p130
aVSo if I talk up here in my nose, you can hear the difference.
p131
aVIf I go down here in my throat,
p132
aVwhich is where most of us speak from most of the time.
p133
aVBut if you want weight,
p134
aVyou need to go down here to the chest.
p135
aVYou hear the difference?
p136
aVWe vote for politicians with lower voices, it's true,
p137
aVbecause we associate depth with power
p138
aVand with authority.
p139
aVThat's register.
p140
aa(lp141
VThen we have timbre.
p142
aVIt's the way your voice feels.
p143
aVAgain, the research shows
p144
aVthat we prefer voices which are rich, smooth, warm,
p145
aVlike hot chocolate.
p146
aVWell if that's not you, that's not the end of the world,
p147
aVbecause you can train.
p148
aVGo and get a voice coach.
p149
aVAnd there are amazing things you can do
p150
aVwith breathing, with posture, and with exercises
p151
aVto improve the timbre of your voice.
p152
aa(lp153
VThen prosody. I love prosody.
p154
aVThis is the sing-song, the meta-language
p155
aVthat we use in order to impart meaning.
p156
aVIt's root one for meaning in conversation.
p157
aVPeople who speak all on one note are really quite hard to listen to
p158
aVif they don't have any prosody at all.
p159
aVThat's where the word "monotonic" comes from,
p160
aVor monotonous, monotone.
p161
aVAlso, we have repetitive prosody now coming in,
p162
aVwhere every sentence ends as if it were a question
p163
aVwhen it's actually not a question, it's a statement?
p164
aa(lp165
V(Laughter)
p166
aa(lp167
VAnd if you repeat that one,
p168
aVit's actually restricting your ability to communicate through prosody,
p169
aVwhich I think is a shame,
p170
aVso let's try and break that habit.
p171
aa(lp172
VPace.
p173
aa(lp174
VI can get very excited by saying something really quickly,
p175
aVor I can slow right down to emphasize,
p176
aVand at the end of that, of course, is our old friend silence.
p177
aVThere's nothing wrong with a bit of silence in a talk, is there?
p178
aVWe don't have to fill it with ums and ahs.
p179
aVIt can be very powerful.
p180
aa(lp181
VOf course, pitch often goes along with pace
p182
aVto indicate arousal, but you can do it just with pitch.
p183
aVWhere did you leave my keys?
p184
aV(Higher pitch) Where did you leave my keys?
p185
aVSo, slightly different meaning in those two deliveries.
p186
aa(lp187
VAnd finally, volume.
p188
aV(Loud) I can get really excited by using volume.
p189
aVSorry about that, if I startled anybody.
p190
aVOr, I can have you really pay attention by getting very quiet.
p191
aVSome people broadcast the whole time.
p192
aVTry not to do that.
p193
aVThat's called sodcasting,
p194
aa(lp195
V(Laughter)
p196
aa(lp197
VImposing your sound on people around you carelessly and inconsiderately.
p198
aVNot nice.
p199
aa(lp200
VOf course, where this all comes into play most of all
p201
aVis when you've got something really important to do.
p202
aVIt might be standing on a stage like this and giving a talk to people.
p203
aVIt might be proposing marriage,
p204
aVasking for a raise, a wedding speech.
p205
aVWhatever it is, if it's really important,
p206
aVyou owe it to yourself to look at this toolbox
p207
aVand the engine that it's going to work on,
p208
aVand no engine works well without being warmed up.
p209
aVWarm up your voice.
p210
aa(lp211
VActually, let me show you how to do that.
p212
aVWould you all like to stand up for a moment?
p213
aVI'm going to show you
p214
aVthe six vocal warm-up exercises that I do before every talk I ever do.
p215
aVAny time you're going to talk to anybody important, do these.
p216
aVFirst, arms up, deep breath in,
p217
aVand sigh out, ahhhhh, like that.
p218
aVOne more time.
p219
aVAhhhh, very good.
p220
aVNow we're going to warm up our lips,
p221
aVand we're going to go Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba,
p222
aVBa, Ba, Ba, Ba. Very good.
p223
aVAnd now, brrrrrrrrrr,
p224
aVjust like when you were a kid.
p225
aVBrrrr. Now your lips should be coming alive.
p226
aVWe're going to do the tongue next
p227
aVwith exaggerated la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.
p228
aVBeautiful. You're getting really good at this.
p229
aVAnd then, roll an R. Rrrrrrr.
p230
aVThat's like champagne for the tongue.
p231
aVFinally, and if I can only do one,
p232
aVthe pros call this the siren.
p233
aVIt's really good. It starts with "we" and goes to "aw."
p234
aVThe "we" is high, the "aw" is low.
p235
aVSo you go, weeeaawww, weeeaawww.
p236
aa(lp237
VFantastic. Give yourselves a round of applause.
p238
aVTake a seat, thank you.
p239
aa(lp240
V(Applause)
p241
aa(lp242
VNext time you speak, do those in advance.
p243
aa(lp244
VNow let me just put this in context to close.
p245
aVThis is a serious point here.
p246
aVThis is where we are now, right?
p247
aVWe speak not very well
p248
aVto people who simply aren't listening
p249
aVin an environment that's all about noise and bad acoustics.
p250
aVI have talked about that on this stage in different phases.
p251
aVWhat would the world be like
p252
aVif we were speaking powerfully
p253
aVto people who were listening consciously
p254
aVin environments which were actually fit for purpose?
p255
aVOr to make that a bit larger,
p256
aVwhat would the world be like
p257
aVif we were creating sound consciously
p258
aVand consuming sound consciously
p259
aVand designing all our environments
p260
aVconsciously for sound?
p261
aVThat would be a world that does sound beautiful,
p262
aVand one where understanding would be the norm,
p263
aVand that is an idea worth spreading.
p264
aa(lp265
VThank you.
