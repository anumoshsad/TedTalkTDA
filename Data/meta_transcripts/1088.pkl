VThere's actually a major health crisis today
p4
aVin terms of the shortage of organs.
p5
aVThe fact is that we're living longer.
p6
aVMedicine has done a much better job
p7
aVof making us live longer,
p8
aVand the problem is, as we age,
p9
aVour organs tend to fail more,
p10
aVand so currently
p11
aVthere are not enough organs to go around.
p12
aVIn fact, in the last 10 years,
p13
aVthe number of patients requiring an organ has doubled,
p14
aVwhile in the same time,
p15
aVthe actual number of transplants has barely gone up.
p16
aVSo this is now a public health crisis.
p17
aa(lp18
VSo that's where this field comes in
p19
aVthat we call the field of regenerative medicine.
p20
aVIt really involves many different areas.
p21
aVYou can use, actually, scaffolds,
p22
aVbiomaterials \u2014
p23
aVthey're like the piece of your blouse or your shirt \u2014
p24
aVbut specific materials you can actually implant in patients
p25
aVand they will do well and help you regenerate.
p26
aVOr we can use cells alone,
p27
aVeither your very own cells
p28
aVor different stem cell populations.
p29
aVOr we can use both.
p30
aVWe can use, actually, biomaterials
p31
aVand the cells together.
p32
aVAnd that's where the field is today.
p33
aa(lp34
VBut it's actually not a new field.
p35
aVInterestingly, this is a book
p36
aVthat was published back in 1938.
p37
aVIt's titled "The Culture of Organs."
p38
aVThe first author, Alexis Carrel, a Nobel Prize winner.
p39
aVHe actually devised some of the same technologies
p40
aVused today for suturing blood vessels,
p41
aVand some of the blood vessel grafts we use today
p42
aVwere actually designed by Alexis.
p43
aVBut I want you to note his co-author:
p44
aVCharles Lindbergh.
p45
aVThat's the same Charles Lindbergh
p46
aVwho actually spent the rest of his life
p47
aVworking with Alexis
p48
aVat the Rockefeller Institute in New York
p49
aVin the area of the culture of organs.
p50
aa(lp51
VSo if the field's been around for so long,
p52
aVwhy so few clinical advances?
p53
aVAnd that really has to do to many different challenges.
p54
aVBut if I were to point to three challenges,
p55
aVthe first one is actually the design of materials
p56
aVthat could go in your body
p57
aVand do well over time.
p58
aVAnd many advances now,
p59
aVwe can do that fairly readily.
p60
aVThe second challenge was cells.
p61
aVWe could not get enough of your cells to grow outside of your body.
p62
aVOver the last 20 years, we've basically tackled that.
p63
aVMany scientists can now grow many different types of cells.
p64
aVPlus we have stem cells.
p65
aVBut even now, 2011,
p66
aVthere's still certain cells that we just can't grow from the patient.
p67
aVLiver cells, nerve cells, pancreatic cells \u2014
p68
aVwe still can't grow them even today.
p69
aVAnd the third challenge is vascularity,
p70
aVthe actual supply of blood
p71
aVto allow those organs or tissues to survive
p72
aVonce we regenerate them.
p73
aa(lp74
VSo we can actually use biomaterials now.
p75
aVThis is actually a biomaterial.
p76
aVWe can weave them, knit them, or we can make them like you see here.
p77
aVThis is actually like a cotton candy machine.
p78
aVYou saw the spray going in.
p79
aVThat was like the fibers of the cotton candy
p80
aVcreating this structure, this tubularized structure,
p81
aVwhich is a biomaterial
p82
aVthat we can then use
p83
aVto help your body regenerate
p84
aVusing your very own cells to do so.
p85
aVAnd that's exactly what we did here.
p86
aa(lp87
VThis is actually a patient
p88
aVwho [was] presented with a deceased organ,
p89
aVand we then created one of these smart biomaterials,
p90
aVand then we then used that smart biomaterial
p91
aVto replace and repair
p92
aVthat patient's structure.
p93
aVWhat we did was we actually
p94
aVused the biomaterial as a bridge
p95
aVso that the cells in the organ
p96
aVcould walk on that bridge, if you will,
p97
aVand help to bridge the gap
p98
aVto regenerate that tissue.
p99
aVAnd you see that patient now six months after
p100
aVwith an X-ray showing you the regenerated tissue,
p101
aVwhich is fully regenerated
p102
aVwhen you analyze it under the microscope.
p103
aVWe can also use cells alone.
p104
aVThese are actually cells that we obtained.
p105
aVThese are stem cells that we create from specific sources,
p106
aVand we can drive them to become heart cells,
p107
aVand they start beating in culture.
p108
aVSo they know what to do.
p109
aVThe cells genetically know what to do,
p110
aVand they start beating together.
p111
aVNow today, many clinical trials
p112
aVare using different kinds of stem cells
p113
aVfor heart disease.
p114
aVSo that's actually now in patients.
p115
aa(lp116
VOr if we're going to use larger structures
p117
aVto replace larger structures,
p118
aVwe can then use the patient's own cells,
p119
aVor some cell population,
p120
aVand the biomaterials,
p121
aVthe scaffolds, together.
p122
aVSo the concept here:
p123
aVso if you do have a deceased or injured organ,
p124
aVwe take a very small piece of that tissue,
p125
aVless than half the size of a postage stamp.
p126
aVWe then tease the cells apart,
p127
aVwe grow the cells outside the body.
p128
aVWe then take a scaffold, a biomaterial \u2014
p129
aVagain, looks very much like a piece of your blouse or your shirt \u2014
p130
aVwe then shape that material,
p131
aVand we then use those cells to coat that material
p132
aVone layer at a time \u2014
p133
aVvery much like baking a layer cake, if you will.
p134
aVWe then place it in an oven-like device,
p135
aVand we're able to create that structure
p136
aVand bring it out.
p137
aVThis is actually a heart valve
p138
aVthat we've engineered,
p139
aVand you can see here, we have the structure of the heart valve
p140
aVand we've seeded that with cells,
p141
aVand then we exercise it.
p142
aVSo you see the leaflets opening and closing \u2014
p143
aVof this heart valve
p144
aVthat's currently being used experimentally
p145
aVto try to get it to further studies.
p146
aa(lp147
VAnother technology
p148
aVthat we have used in patients
p149
aVactually involves bladders.
p150
aVWe actually take a very small piece of the bladder from the patient \u2014
p151
aVless than half the size of a postage stamp.
p152
aVWe then grow the cells outside the body,
p153
aVtake the scaffold, coat the scaffold with the cells \u2014
p154
aVthe patient's own cells, two different cell types.
p155
aVWe then put it in this oven-like device.
p156
aVIt has the same conditions as the human body \u2014
p157
aV37 degrees centigrade, 95 percent oxygen.
p158
aVA few weeks later, you have your engineered organ
p159
aVthat we're able to implant back into the patient.
p160
aVFor these specific patients, we actually just suture these materials.
p161
aVWe use three-dimensional imagining analysis,
p162
aVbut we actually created these biomaterials by hand.
p163
aa(lp164
VBut we now have better ways
p165
aVto create these structures with the cells.
p166
aVWe use now some type of technologies,
p167
aVwhere for solid organs, for example,
p168
aVlike the liver,
p169
aVwhat we do is we take discard livers.
p170
aVAs you know, a lot of organs are actually discarded, not used.
p171
aVSo we can take these liver structures,
p172
aVwhich are not going to be used,
p173
aVand we then put them in a washing machine-like structure
p174
aVthat will allow the cells to be washed away.
p175
aVTwo weeks later,
p176
aVyou have something that looks like a liver.
p177
aVYou can hold it like a liver,
p178
aVbut it has no cells; it's just a skeleton of the liver.
p179
aVAnd we then can re-perfuse the liver with cells,
p180
aVpreserving the blood vessel tree.
p181
aVSo we actually perfuse first the blood vessel tree
p182
aVwith the patient's own blood vessel cells,
p183
aVand we then infiltrate the parenchyma with the liver cells.
p184
aVAnd we now have been able just to show
p185
aVthe creation of human liver tissue
p186
aVjust this past month
p187
aVusing this technology.
p188
aa(lp189
VAnother technology that we've used
p190
aVis actually that of printing.
p191
aVThis is actually a desktop inkjet printer,
p192
aVbut instead of using ink,
p193
aVwe're using cells.
p194
aVAnd you can actually see here the printhead
p195
aVgoing through and printing this structure,
p196
aVand it takes about 40 minutes to print this structure.
p197
aVAnd there's a 3D elevator
p198
aVthat then actually goes down one layer at a time
p199
aVeach time the printhead goes through.
p200
aVAnd then finally you're able to get that structure out.
p201
aVYou can pop that structure out of the printer and implant it.
p202
aVAnd this is actually a piece of bone
p203
aVthat I'm going to show you in this slide
p204
aVthat was actually created with this desktop printer
p205
aVand implanted as you see here.
p206
aVThat was all new bone that was implanted
p207
aVusing these techniques.
p208
aa(lp209
VAnother more advanced technology we're looking at right now,
p210
aVour next generation of technologies,
p211
aVare more sophisticated printers.
p212
aVThis particular printer we're designing now
p213
aVis actually one where we print right on the patient.
p214
aVSo what you see here \u2014
p215
aVI know it sounds funny,
p216
aVbut that's the way it works.
p217
aVBecause in reality, what you want to do
p218
aVis you actually want to have the patient on the bed with the wound,
p219
aVand you have a scanner,
p220
aVbasically like a flatbed scanner.
p221
aVThat's what you see here on the right side.
p222
aVYou see a scanner technology
p223
aVthat first scans the wound on the patient
p224
aVand then it comes back with the printheads
p225
aVactually printing the layers that you require
p226
aVon the patients themselves.
p227
aa(lp228
VThis is how it actually works.
p229
aVHere's the scanner going through,
p230
aVscanning the wound.
p231
aVOnce it's scanned,
p232
aVit sends information in the correct layers of cells
p233
aVwhere they need to be.
p234
aVAnd now you're going to see here
p235
aVa demo of this actually being done
p236
aVin a representative wound.
p237
aVAnd we actually do this with a gel so that you can lift the gel material.
p238
aVSo once those cells are on the patient
p239
aVthey will stick where they need to be.
p240
aVAnd this is actually new technology
p241
aVstill under development.
p242
aa(lp243
VWe're also working on more sophisticated printers.
p244
aVBecause in reality, our biggest challenge
p245
aVare the solid organs.
p246
aVI don't know if you realize this,
p247
aVbut 90 percent of the patients on the transplant list
p248
aVare actually waiting for a kidney.
p249
aVPatients are dying every day
p250
aVbecause we don't have enough of those organs to go around.
p251
aVSo this is more challenging \u2014
p252
aVlarge organ, vascular,
p253
aVa lot of blood vessel supply,
p254
aVa lot of cells present.
p255
aVSo the strategy here is \u2014
p256
aVthis is actually a CT scan, an X-ray \u2014
p257
aVand we go layer by layer,
p258
aVusing computerized morphometric imaging analysis
p259
aVand 3D reconstruction
p260
aVto get right down to those patient's own kidneys.
p261
aVWe then are able to actually image those,
p262
aVdo 360 degree rotation
p263
aVto analyze the kidney
p264
aVin its full volumetric characteristics,
p265
aVand we then are able
p266
aVto actually take this information
p267
aVand then scan this
p268
aVin a printing computerized form.
p269
aVSo we go layer by layer through the organ,
p270
aVanalyzing each layer as we go through the organ,
p271
aVand we then are able to send that information, as you see here,
p272
aVthrough the computer
p273
aVand actually design the organ
p274
aVfor the patient.
p275
aVThis actually shows the actual printer.
p276
aVAnd this actually shows that printing.
p277
aa(lp278
VIn fact, we actually have the printer right here.
p279
aVSo while we've been talking today,
p280
aVyou can actually see the printer
p281
aVback here in the back stage.
p282
aVThat's actually the actual printer right now,
p283
aVand that's been printing this kidney structure
p284
aVthat you see here.
p285
aVIt takes about seven hours to print a kidney,
p286
aVso this is about three hours into it now.
p287
aVAnd Dr. Kang's going to walk onstage right now,
p288
aVand we're actually going to show you one of these kidneys
p289
aVthat we printed a little bit earlier today.
p290
aVPut a pair of gloves here.
p291
aVThank you.
p292
aVGo backwards.
p293
aVSo, these gloves are a little bit small on me, but here it is.
p294
aVYou can actually see that kidney
p295
aVas it was printed earlier today.
p296
aa(lp297
V(Applause)
p298
aa(lp299
VHas a little bit of consistency to it.
p300
aVThis is Dr. Kang who's been working with us on this project,
p301
aVand part of our team.
p302
aVThank you, Dr. Kang. I appreciate it.
p303
aa(lp304
V(Applause)
p305
aa(lp306
VSo this is actually a new generation.
p307
aVThis is actually the printer that you see here onstage.
p308
aVAnd this is actually a new technology we're working on now.
p309
aVIn reality, we now have a long history of doing this.
p310
aVI'm going to share with you a clip
p311
aVin terms of technology we have had in patients now for a while.
p312
aa(lp313
VAnd this is actually a very brief clip \u2014
p314
aVonly about 30 seconds \u2014
p315
aVof a patient who actually received an organ.
p316
aa(lp317
V(Video) Luke Massella: I was really sick. I could barely get out of bed.
p318
aVI was missing school. It was pretty much miserable.
p319
aVI couldn't go out
p320
aVand play basketball at recess
p321
aVwithout feeling like I was going to pass out
p322
aVwhen I got back inside.
p323
aVI felt so sick.
p324
aVI was facing basically a lifetime of dialysis,
p325
aVand I don't even like to think about what my life would be like
p326
aVif I was on that.
p327
aVSo after the surgery,
p328
aVlife got a lot better for me.
p329
aVI was able to do more things.
p330
aVI was able to wrestle in high school.
p331
aVI became the captain of the team, and that was great.
p332
aVI was able to be a normal kid with my friends.
p333
aVAnd because they used my own cells to build this bladder,
p334
aVit's going to be with me.
p335
aVI've got it for life, so I'm all set.
p336
aa(lp337
V(Applause)
p338
aa(lp339
VJuan Enriquez: These experiments sometimes work,
p340
aVand it's very cool when they do.
p341
aVLuke, come up please.
p342
aa(lp343
V(Applause)
p344
aa(lp345
VSo Luke, before last night,
p346
aVwhen's the last time you saw Tony?
p347
aa(lp348
VLM: Ten years ago, when I had my surgery \u2014
p349
aVand it's really great to see him.
p350
aa(lp351
V(Laughter)
p352
aa(lp353
V(Applause)
p354
aa(lp355
VJE: And tell us a little bit about what you're doing.
p356
aa(lp357
VLM: Well right now I'm in college at the University of Connecticut.
p358
aVI'm a sophomore and studying communications, TV and mass media,
p359
aVand basically trying to live life like a normal kid,
p360
aVwhich I always wanted growing up.
p361
aVBut it was hard to do that when I was born with spina bifida
p362
aVand my kidneys and bladder weren't working.
p363
aVI went through about 16 surgeries,
p364
aVand it seemed impossible to do that
p365
aVwhen I was in kidney failure when I was 10.
p366
aVAnd this surgery came along
p367
aVand basically made me who I am today
p368
aVand saved my life.
p369
aa(lp370
V(Applause)
p371
aa(lp372
VJE: And Tony's done hundreds of these?
p373
aa(lp374
VLM: What I know from, he's working really hard in his lab
p375
aVand coming up with crazy stuff.
p376
aVI know I was one of the first 10 people to have this surgery.
p377
aVAnd when I was 10, I didn't realize how amazing it was.
p378
aVI was a little kid, and I was like,
p379
aV"Yeah. I'll have that. I'll have that surgery."
p380
aV(Laughter)
p381
aVAll I wanted to do was to get better,
p382
aVand I didn't realize how amazing it really was until now that I'm older
p383
aVand I see the amazing things that he's doing.
p384
aa(lp385
VJE: When you got this call out of the blue \u2014
p386
aVTony's really shy,
p387
aVand it took a lot of convincing
p388
aVto get somebody as modest as Tony
p389
aVto allow us to bring Luke.
p390
aVSo Luke, you go to your communications professors \u2014
p391
aVyou're majoring in communications \u2014
p392
aVand you ask them for permission to come to TED,
p393
aVwhich might have a little bit to do with communications,
p394
aVand what was their reaction?
p395
aa(lp396
VLM: Most of my professors were all for it,
p397
aVand they said, "Bring pictures
p398
aVand show me the clips online," and "I'm happy for you."
p399
aVThere were a couple that were a little stubborn,
p400
aVbut I had to talk to them.
p401
aVI pulled them aside.
p402
aa(lp403
VJE: Well, it's an honor and a privilege to meet you.
p404
aVThank you so much. (LM: Thank you so much.)
p405
aa(lp406
VJE: Thank you, Tony.
