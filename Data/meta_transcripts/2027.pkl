VPuzzles
p4
aVand magic.
p5
aVI work in what most people think
p6
aVare two distinct fields,
p7
aVbut I believe they are the same.
p8
aVI am both a magician and
p9
aVa New York Times crossword puzzle constructor,
p10
aVwhich basically means I've taken
p11
aVthe world's two nerdiest hobbies
p12
aVand combined them into one career.
p13
aVAnd I believe that magic and puzzles are the same
p14
aVbecause they both key into one of
p15
aVthe most important human drives:
p16
aVthe urge to solve.
p17
aVHuman beings are wired to solve,
p18
aVto make order out of chaos.
p19
aa(lp20
VIt's certainly true for me.
p21
aVI've been solving my whole life.
p22
aVHigh school consisted of epic Scrabble matches in the cafeteria
p23
aVand not really talking to girls,
p24
aVand then at about that time
p25
aVI started learning magic tricks
p26
aVand definitely not talking to girls.
p27
aVThere's nothing like starting a conversation with,
p28
aV"Hey, did you know that 'prestidigitation' is worth
p29
aV20 points in Scrabble?"
p30
aVBut back then, I noticed an intersection
p31
aVbetween puzzles and illusion.
p32
aVWhen you do the crossword puzzle
p33
aVor when you watch a magic show,
p34
aVyou become a solver,
p35
aVand your goal is to try to find the order in the chaos,
p36
aVthe chaos of, say, a black-and-white puzzle grid,
p37
aVa mixed-up bag of Scrabble tiles,
p38
aVor a shuffled pack of playing cards.
p39
aVAnd today, as a cruciverbalist \u2014
p40
aV23 points \u2014
p41
aVand an illusion designer, I create that chaos.
p42
aVI test your ability to solve.
p43
aa(lp44
VNow, it turns out research tells us
p45
aVthat solving is as primal as eating and sleeping.
p46
aVFrom birth, we are wired to solve.
p47
aVIn one UCLA study, newborns still in the hospital
p48
aVwere shown patterns, patterns like this:
p49
aVcircle, cross, circle, cross.
p50
aVAnd then the pattern was changed: triangle, square.
p51
aVAnd by tracking an infant's gaze,
p52
aVwe know that newborns as young as a day old
p53
aVcan notice and respond to disruptions in order.
p54
aVIt's remarkable.
p55
aVSo from infancy through old age,
p56
aVthe urge to solve unites us all,
p57
aVand I even found this photo on Instagram
p58
aVof pop star Katy Perry solving a crossword puzzle
p59
aVwith her morning coffee.
p60
aa(lp61
VLike.
p62
aV(Laughter)
p63
aa(lp64
VNow, solving exists across all cultures.
p65
aVThe American invention is the crossword puzzle,
p66
aVand this year we are celebrating
p67
aVthe 100th anniversary of the crossword puzzle,
p68
aVfirst published in The New York World.
p69
aVBut many other cultures have their signature puzzles as well.
p70
aVChina gives us tangrams,
p71
aVwhich would test solvers' abilities
p72
aVto form shapes from the jumbled pieces.
p73
aVChaos. Order.
p74
aVOrder.
p75
aVAnd order.
p76
aVThat one's my favorite, let's hear it again.
p77
aVOkay.
p78
aVAnd how about this puzzle
p79
aVinvented in 18th-century England:
p80
aVthe jigsaw puzzle.
p81
aVIs this not making order out of chaos?
p82
aa(lp83
VSo as you can see,
p84
aVwe are always solving.
p85
aVWe are always trying to decode our world.
p86
aVIt's an eternal quest.
p87
aVIt's just like the one Cervantes wrote about
p88
aVin "Don Quixote,"
p89
aVwhich by the way is the root of the word "quixotry,"
p90
aVthe highest-scoring Scrabble word of all time,
p91
aV365 points.
p92
aVBut anyway, "Don Quixote" is an important book.
p93
aVYou guys have read "Don Quixote," yes?
p94
aVI'm seeing some heads nod.
p95
aVCome on guys, really?
p96
aVWho's read "Don Quixote?" Let's do this. Raise your hands if you've read "Don Quixote."
p97
aVThere we go. Smart audience.
p98
aVWho's read "Don Quixote?" Get them up.
p99
aa(lp100
VOkay, good, because I need somebody smart here
p101
aVbecause now I'm going to demonstrate
p102
aVwith the help of one of you
p103
aVjust how deeply rooted your urge to solve is,
p104
aVjust how wired to solve all of you really are,
p105
aVso I'm going to come into the audience
p106
aVand find somebody to help me.
p107
aVLet's see.
p108
aVEverybody's looking away all of a sudden.
p109
aVCan I? Would you? What is your name? Gwen.
p110
aVI'm not a mind reader, I can see your name tag.
p111
aVCome with me, Gwen. Everyone give her  a round of applause, make her feel welcome.
p112
aVGwen, after you.
p113
aV(Applause)
p114
aa(lp115
VAre you so excited?
p116
aVDid you know that your name is worth
p117
aVeight points in Scrabble?
p118
aVOkay, stand right here, Gwen, right here.
p119
aa(lp120
VNow, Gwen, before we begin,
p121
aVI'd like to point out a piece of the puzzle,
p122
aVwhich is here in this envelope,
p123
aVand I will not go near it. Okay?
p124
aVAnd over here we have a drawing of some farm animals.
p125
aVYou can see we have an owl, we have a horse,
p126
aVa donkey, a rooster, an ox, and a sheep,
p127
aVand then here, Gwen, we have
p128
aVsome fancy art store markers,
p129
aVcolors like, can you see that word right there?
p130
aVGwen: Cobalt. David Kwong: Cobalt, yes. Cobalt.
p131
aVBut we have a silver, a red, an emerald,
p132
aVand an amber marker,
p133
aVand Gwen, you are going to color this drawing
p134
aVjust like you were five years old,
p135
aVone marker at a time.
p136
aVIt's going to be a lot of fun.
p137
aVBut I'm going to go over here.
p138
aVI don't want to see what you're doing.
p139
aVOkay, so don't start yet.
p140
aVWait for me to get over here and close my eyes.
p141
aVNow Gwen, are you ready?
p142
aa(lp143
VPick up just one marker, pick up just one marker,
p144
aVand why don't you color in the horse for me?
p145
aVColor in the horse \u2014 big, big, big scribbles,
p146
aVbroad strokes, don't worry about staying in the lines.
p147
aVAll right. Great.
p148
aVAnd why don't you take that marker and recap it
p149
aVand place it on the table for me.
p150
aVOkay, and pick up another marker out of the cup
p151
aVand take off the cap
p152
aVand color in the donkey for me, color in the donkey.
p153
aVBig scribbles.
p154
aVOkay, cool, and re-cap that marker
p155
aVand place it on the table.
p156
aVAnd pick up another marker for me
p157
aVand take off the cap. Isn't this fun?
p158
aVAnd color in the owl for me.
p159
aVColor in the owl.
p160
aVOkay, and recap that marker
p161
aVand pick up another marker out of the cup
p162
aVand color in the rooster for me, color in the rooster.
p163
aVGood, good, good, good, good.
p164
aVBig, big, big strokes. Good, good.
p165
aVPick up another marker out of the cup
p166
aVand color in the ox for me. Color in the ox.
p167
aVOkay, good.
p168
aVA lot of color on that, and recap, and place it on the table,
p169
aVand pick up another marker out of the cup.
p170
aVOh, I'm out? Okay, I'm going to turn around.
p171
aVDid I forget? Oh, I forgot my purple marker.
p172
aVThis is still going to work, though.
p173
aVI think this is still going to work, mostly.
p174
aa(lp175
VSo Gwen, I'm going to hand you this envelope.
p176
aVDon't open it yet. Do not open it yet,
p177
aVbut I am going to write down your choices
p178
aVso that everybody can see
p179
aVthe choices that you made.
p180
aVOkay, great. So we have a cobalt horse,
p181
aVamber owl,
p182
aVa silver ox,
p183
aVyes, okay, a red donkey,
p184
aVand what was the emerald color? A rooster.
p185
aVAn emerald rooster. Okay.
p186
aa(lp187
VNow for the moment of truth, Gwen,
p188
aVwe're going to take a look in that envelope.
p189
aVWhy don't you open it up and remove
p190
aVthe one piece of paper from inside
p191
aVand hand it to me,
p192
aVand we will see if it matches your choices.
p193
aVYes, I think it does.
p194
aVWe have a cobalt horse, we have a red donkey,
p195
aVwe have an amber owl, we have an emerald rooster, a silver ox,
p196
aVI forgot my purple marker so we have a blank sheep,
p197
aVbut that's a pretty amazing coincidence, don't you think?
p198
aVGwen, well done. That's beautiful. (Applause)
p199
aVI'll take that back from you.
p200
aa(lp201
VSo ladies and gentlemen, how is this possible?
p202
aVHow is this possible? Well, could it be
p203
aVthat Gwen's brain is so wired to solve
p204
aVthat she decoded hidden messages?
p205
aVWell this is the puzzle I present to you.
p206
aVCould there be order
p207
aVin the chaos that I created?
p208
aVLet's take a closer look.
p209
aVDo you recall when I showed you these puzzle pieces?
p210
aVWhat image did it ultimately become? A cobalt horse.
p211
aVThe plot thickens.
p212
aVAnd then we played a game of tangrams
p213
aVwith an emerald rooster.
p214
aVThat one's my favorite.
p215
aVAnd then we had an experiment with a silver ox.
p216
aVAnd Katy Perry drinks her morning coffee
p217
aVout of an amber owl.
p218
aVThank you, Katy, for taking that photo for me.
p219
aVOh, and there's one more, there's one more.
p220
aVI believe you colored a red donkey, Gwen.
p221
aVLadies and gentlemen, could you raise your hands
p222
aVfor me if you've read "Don Quixote?"
p223
aVWho's read "Don Quixote?" (Laughter)
p224
aVBut wait, but wait, wait, wait, wait, there's more.
p225
aVThere's more.
p226
aVGwen, I was so confident
p227
aVthat you were going to make these choices
p228
aVthat I made another prediction,
p229
aVand I put it in an even more indelible place,
p230
aVand it's right here.
p231
aVLadies and gentlemen,
p232
aVwe have today's New York Times.
p233
aVThe date is March 18th, 2014.
p234
aVMany of you in the first couple of rows
p235
aVhave it underneath your seats as well.
p236
aVReally dig. We hid them under there.
p237
aVSee if you can fish out the newspaper
p238
aVand open up to the arts section
p239
aVand you will find the crossword puzzle,
p240
aVand the crossword puzzle today
p241
aVwas written by yours truly.
p242
aVYou can see my name above the grid.
p243
aVI'm going to give this to you, Gwen, to take a look.
p244
aVAnd I will also put it up on the screen.
p245
aVNow let's take a look
p246
aVat another piece of the puzzle.
p247
aVIf you look at the first clue for 1-across,
p248
aVit starts with the letter C, for corrupt,
p249
aVand just below that we have an O, for outfielder,
p250
aVand if you keep reading the first letters of the clues down,
p251
aVyou get cobalt horse,
p252
aVamber owl, silver ox,
p253
aVred donkey, and emerald rooster.
p254
aV(Applause)
p255
aVThat's pretty cool, right?
p256
aVIt's The New York Times.
p257
aVBut wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait.
p258
aVOh, Gwen,
p259
aVdo you recall how I forgot my purple marker,
p260
aVand you were unable to color the sheep?
p261
aVWell, if you keep reading
p262
aVstarting with 25-down,
p263
aVit says,
p264
aV"Oh, by the way,
p265
aVthe sheep can be left blank."
p266
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p267
aVBut wait, wait, wait, there's one more thing,
p268
aVthere's one more thing,
p269
aVthere's one final piece of the puzzle.
p270
aVGwen, I am so grateful for your choices
p271
aVbecause if we take a look
p272
aVat the first letters of your combinations,
p273
aVwe get "C-H-A-O-S" for chaos
p274
aVand "O-R-D-E-R" for order.
p275
aVThat's chaos and order.
p276
aVWe've all made order out of chaos.
p277
aa(lp278
VSo ladies and gentlemen, the next time
p279
aVyou find yourself with a puzzle,
p280
aVwhether it's in your life or in your work,
p281
aVor maybe it's at the Sunday morning
p282
aVbreakfast table with The New York Times,
p283
aVremember, you are all wired to solve.
p284
