VWhen I was considering a career in the art world,
p4
aVI took a course in London,
p5
aVand one of my supervisors was this irascible Italian
p6
aVcalled Pietro, who drank too much,
p7
aVsmoked too much and swore much too much.
p8
aVBut he was a passionate teacher,
p9
aVand I remember one of our earlier classes with him,
p10
aVhe was projecting images on the wall,
p11
aVasking us to think about them,
p12
aVand he put up an image of a painting.
p13
aVIt was a landscape with figures, semi-dressed,
p14
aVdrinking wine. There was a nude woman
p15
aVin the lower foreground, and on the hillside in the back,
p16
aVthere was a figure of the mythological god Bacchus,
p17
aVand he said, "What is this?"
p18
aa(lp19
VAnd I \u2014 no one else did, so I put up my hand, and I said,
p20
aV"It's a Bacchanal by Titian."
p21
aa(lp22
VHe said, "It's a what?"
p23
aa(lp24
VI thought maybe I'd pronounced it wrong.
p25
aV"It's a Bacchanal by Titian."
p26
aa(lp27
VHe said, "It's a what?"
p28
aa(lp29
VI said, "It's a Bacchanal by Titian." (Laughter)
p30
aa(lp31
VHe said, "You boneless bookworm!
p32
aVIt's a fucking orgy!"
p33
aV(Laughter)
p34
aVAs I said, he swore too much.
p35
aa(lp36
VThere was an important lesson for me in that.
p37
aVPietro was suspicious of formal art training,
p38
aVart history training, because he feared
p39
aVthat it filled people up with jargon, and then they just
p40
aVclassified things rather than looking at them,
p41
aVand he wanted to remind us that all art was once contemporary,
p42
aVand he wanted us to use our eyes,
p43
aVand he was especially evangelical about this message,
p44
aVbecause he was losing his sight.
p45
aVHe wanted us to look and ask basic questions of objects.
p46
aVWhat is it? How is it made? Why was it made?
p47
aVHow is it used?
p48
aVAnd these were important lessons to me when
p49
aVI subsequently became a professional art historian.
p50
aa(lp51
VMy kind of eureka moment came a few years later,
p52
aVwhen I was studying the art of the courts of Northern Europe,
p53
aVand of course it was very much discussed in terms of
p54
aVthe paintings and the sculptures
p55
aVand the architecture of the day.
p56
aVBut as I began to read historical documents
p57
aVand contemporary descriptions,
p58
aVI found there was a kind of a missing component,
p59
aVfor everywhere I came across descriptions of tapestries.
p60
aVTapestries were ubiquitous between the Middle Ages
p61
aVand, really, well into the 18th century,
p62
aVand it was pretty apparent why.
p63
aVTapestries were portable. You could roll them up,
p64
aVsend them ahead of you, and in the time
p65
aVit took to hang them up, you could transform a cold,
p66
aVdank interior into a richly colored setting.
p67
aVTapestries effectively provided a vast canvas
p68
aVon which the patrons of the day could depict the heroes
p69
aVwith whom they wanted to be associated,
p70
aVor even themselves,
p71
aVand in addition to that, tapestries were hugely expensive.
p72
aVThey required scores of highly skilled weavers
p73
aVworking over extended periods of time
p74
aVwith very expensive materials \u2014 the wools, the silks,
p75
aVeven gold and silver thread.
p76
aVSo, all in all, in an age when the visual image
p77
aVof any kind was rare, tapestries were an incredibly potent
p78
aVform of propaganda.
p79
aa(lp80
VWell, I became a tapestry historian.
p81
aVIn due course, I ended up as a curator
p82
aVat the Metropolitan Museum, because I saw the Met
p83
aVas one of the few places where I could organize
p84
aVreally big exhibitions about the subject
p85
aVI cared so passionately about.
p86
aVAnd in about 1997, the then-director Philippe de Montebello
p87
aVgave me the go-ahead to organize an exhibition
p88
aVfor 2002. We normally have these very long lead-in times.
p89
aa(lp90
VIt wasn't straightforward. It's no longer a question
p91
aVof chucking a tapestry in the back of a car.
p92
aVThey have to be wound on huge rollers,
p93
aVshipped in oversized freighters.
p94
aVSome of them are so big we had, to get them into the museum,
p95
aVwe had to take them up the great steps at the front.
p96
aa(lp97
VWe thought very hard about how to present this
p98
aVunknown subject to a modern audience:
p99
aVthe dark colors to set off the colors that remained
p100
aVin objects that were often faded;
p101
aVthe placing of lights to bring out the silk and the gold thread;
p102
aVthe labeling.
p103
aVYou know, we live in an age where we are so used
p104
aVto television images and photographs,
p105
aVa one-hit image. These were big, complex things,
p106
aValmost like cartoons with multiple narratives.
p107
aVWe had to draw our audience in, get them to slow down,
p108
aVto explore the objects.
p109
aa(lp110
VThere was a lot of skepticism. On the opening night,
p111
aVI overheard one of the senior members of staff saying,
p112
aV"This is going to be a bomb."
p113
aVBut in reality, in the course of the coming weeks and months,
p114
aVhundreds of thousands of people came to see the show.
p115
aVThe exhibition was designed to be an experience,
p116
aVand tapestries are hard to reproduce in photographs.
p117
aVSo I want you to use your imaginations,
p118
aVthinking of these wall-high objects,
p119
aVsome of them 10 meters wide,
p120
aVdepicting lavish court scenes with courtiers and dandies
p121
aVwho would look quite at home in the pages of the fashion press today,
p122
aVthick woods with hunters crashing through the undergrowth
p123
aVin pursuit of wild boars and deer,
p124
aVviolent battles with scenes of fear and heroism.
p125
aVI remember taking my son's school class. He was eight at the time,
p126
aVand all the little boys, they kind of \u2014 you know, they were little boys,
p127
aVand then the thing that caught their attention
p128
aVwas in one of the hunting scenes there was a dog
p129
aVpooping in the foreground \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p130
aVkind of an in-your-face joke by the artist.
p131
aVAnd you can just imagine them.
p132
aVBut it brought it alive to them. I think they suddenly saw
p133
aVthat these weren't just old faded tapestries.
p134
aVThese were images of the world in the past,
p135
aVand that it was the same for our audience.
p136
aVAnd for me as a curator, I felt proud. I felt I'd shifted the needle a little.
p137
aVThrough this experience that could only be created
p138
aVin a museum, I'd opened up the eyes of my audience \u2014
p139
aVhistorians, artists, press, the general public \u2014
p140
aVto the beauty of this lost medium.
p141
aa(lp142
VA few years later, I was invited to be the director
p143
aVof the museum, and after I got over that \u2014
p144
aV"Who, me? The tapestry geek? I don't wear a tie!" \u2014
p145
aVI realized the fact: I believe passionately in that
p146
aVcurated museum experience.
p147
aVWe live in an age of ubiquitous information,
p148
aVand sort of "just add water" expertise,
p149
aVbut there's nothing that compares with the presentation
p150
aVof significant objects in a well-told narrative,
p151
aVwhat the curator does, the interpretation of a complex,
p152
aVesoteric subject, in a way that retains the integrity
p153
aVof the subject, that makes it \u2014 unpacks it
p154
aVfor a general audience.
p155
aVAnd that, to me, today, is now the challenge and the fun
p156
aVof my job, supporting the vision of my curators,
p157
aVwhether it's an exhibition of Samurai swords,
p158
aVearly Byzantine artifacts, Renaissance portraits,
p159
aVor the show we heard mentioned earlier,
p160
aVthe McQueen show, with which we enjoyed
p161
aVso much success last summer.
p162
aa(lp163
VThat was an interesting case.
p164
aVIn the late spring, early summer of 2010, shortly after
p165
aVMcQueen's suicide,
p166
aVour curator of costume, Andrew Bolton, came to see me,
p167
aVand said, "I've been thinking of doing a show on McQueen,
p168
aVand now is the moment. We have to, we have to do it fast."
p169
aa(lp170
VIt wasn't easy. McQueen had worked throughout his career
p171
aVwith a small team of designers and managers
p172
aVwho were very protective of his legacy,
p173
aVbut Andrew went to London and worked with them
p174
aVover the summer and won their confidence, and that of
p175
aVthe designers who created his amazing fashion shows,
p176
aVwhich were works of performance art in their own right,
p177
aVand we proceeded to do something at the museum,
p178
aVI think, we've never done before.
p179
aVIt wasn't just your standard installation.
p180
aVIn fact, we ripped down the galleries to recreate
p181
aVentirely different settings, a recreation of his first studio,
p182
aVa hall of mirrors,
p183
aVa curiosity box,
p184
aVa sunken ship, a burned-out interior,
p185
aVwith videos and soundtracks that ranged from
p186
aVoperatic arias to pigs fornicating.
p187
aVAnd in this extraordinary setting, the costumes
p188
aVwere like actors and actresses, or living sculptures.
p189
aVIt could have been a train wreck.
p190
aVIt could have looked like shop windows on Fifth Avenue
p191
aVat Christmas, but because of the way that Andrew
p192
aVconnected with the McQueen team, he was channeling
p193
aVthe rawness and the brilliance of McQueen,
p194
aVand the show was quite transcendant,
p195
aVand it became a phenomenon in its own right.
p196
aVBy the end of the show, we had people queuing
p197
aVfor four or five hours to get into the show,
p198
aVbut no one really complained.
p199
aVI heard over and over again, "Wow, that was worth it.
p200
aVIt was a such a visceral, emotive experience."
p201
aa(lp202
VNow, I've described two very immersive exhibitions,
p203
aVbut I also believe that collections, individual objects,
p204
aVcan also have that same power.
p205
aVThe Met was set up not as a museum of American art,
p206
aVbut of an encyclopedic museum,
p207
aVand today, 140 years later, that vision
p208
aVis as prescient as ever,
p209
aVbecause, of course, we live in a world of crisis,
p210
aVof challenge, and we're exposed to it
p211
aVthrough the 24/7 newsreels.
p212
aVIt's in our galleries that we can unpack the civilizations,
p213
aVthe cultures, that we're seeing the current manifestation of.
p214
aVWhether it's Libya, Egypt, Syria,
p215
aVit's in our galleries that we can explain
p216
aVand give greater understanding.
p217
aa(lp218
VI mean, our new Islamic galleries are a case in point,
p219
aVopened 10 years, almost to the week, after 9/11.
p220
aVI think for most Americans, knowledge of the Islamic world
p221
aVwas pretty slight before 9/11, and then it was thrust upon us
p222
aVin one of America's darkest hours,
p223
aVand the perception was through the polarization
p224
aVof that terrible event.
p225
aVNow, in our galleries, we show 14 centuries
p226
aVof the development of different Islamic cultures
p227
aVacross a vast geographic spread,
p228
aVand, again, hundreds of thousands of people have come
p229
aVto see these galleries since they opened last October.
p230
aa(lp231
VI'm often asked, "Is digital media replacing the museum?"
p232
aVand I think those numbers are a resounding rejection
p233
aVof that notion. I mean, don't get me wrong,
p234
aVI'm a huge advocate of the Web.
p235
aVIt gives us a way of reaching out to audiences
p236
aVaround the globe, but nothing replaces the authenticity
p237
aVof the object presented with passionate scholarship.
p238
aVBringing people face to face with our objects
p239
aVis a way of bringing them face to face with people
p240
aVacross time, across space, whose lives may have been
p241
aVvery different to our own, but who, like us,
p242
aVhad hopes and dreams, frustrations and achievements
p243
aVin their lives. And I think this is a process
p244
aVthat helps us better understand ourselves,
p245
aVhelps us make better decisions about where we're going.
p246
aa(lp247
VThe Great Hall at the Met is one of the great portals of the world,
p248
aVawe-inspiring, like a medieval cathedral.
p249
aVFrom there, you can walk in any direction
p250
aVto almost any culture.
p251
aVI frequently go out into the hall and the galleries
p252
aVand I watch our visitors coming in.
p253
aVSome of them are comfortable. They feel at home.
p254
aVThey know what they're looking for.
p255
aVOthers are very uneasy. It's an intimidating place.
p256
aVThey feel that the institution is elitist.
p257
aVI'm working to try and break down that sense of that elitism.
p258
aVI want to put people in a contemplative frame of mind,
p259
aVwhere they're prepared to be a little bit lost, to explore,
p260
aVto see the unfamiliar in the familiar,
p261
aVor to try the unknown.
p262
aVBecause for us, it's all about bringing them face to face
p263
aVwith great works of art,
p264
aVcapturing them at that moment of discomfort,
p265
aVwhen the inclination is kind of to reach for your iPhone,
p266
aVyour Blackberry, but to create a zone
p267
aVwhere their curiosity can expand.
p268
aVAnd whether it's in the expression of a Greek sculpture
p269
aVthat reminds you of a friend,
p270
aVor a dog pooping in the corner of a tapestry,
p271
aVor, to bring it back to my tutor Pietro,
p272
aVthose dancing figures
p273
aVwho are indeed knocking back the wine,
p274
aVand that nude figure in the left foreground.
p275
aVWow. She is a gorgeous embodiment of youthful sexuality.
p276
aVIn that moment, our scholarship can tell you
p277
aVthat this is a bacchanal,
p278
aVbut if we're doing our job right,
p279
aVand you've checked the jargon at the front door,
p280
aVtrust your instinct.
p281
aVYou know it's an orgy.
p282
aVThank you. (Applause)
