VIn the early days of Twitter, it was like a place of radical de-shaming.
p4
aVPeople would admit shameful secrets about themselves,
p5
aVand other people would say, "Oh my God, I'm exactly the same."
p6
aVVoiceless people realized that they had a voice,
p7
aVand it was powerful and eloquent.
p8
aVIf a newspaper ran some racist or homophobic column,
p9
aVwe realized we could do something about it.
p10
aVWe could get them.
p11
aVWe could hit them with a weapon that we understood but they didn't \u2014
p12
aVa social media shaming.
p13
aVAdvertisers would withdraw their advertising.
p14
aVWhen powerful people misused their privilege,
p15
aVwe were going to get them.
p16
aVThis was like the democratization of justice.
p17
aVHierarchies were being leveled out.
p18
aVWe were going to do things better.
p19
aa(lp20
VSoon after that, a disgraced pop science writer called Jonah Lehrer \u2014
p21
aVhe'd been caught plagiarizing and faking quotes,
p22
aVand he was drenched in shame and regret, he told me.
p23
aVAnd he had the opportunity
p24
aVto publicly apologize at a foundation lunch.
p25
aVThis was going to be the most important speech of his life.
p26
aVMaybe it would win him some salvation.
p27
aVHe knew before he arrived
p28
aVthat the foundation was going to be live-streaming his event,
p29
aVbut what he didn't know until he turned up,
p30
aVwas that they'd erected a giant screen Twitter feed right next to his head.
p31
aV(Laughter)
p32
aVAnother one in a monitor screen in his eye line.
p33
aa(lp34
VI don't think the foundation did this because they were monstrous.
p35
aVI think they were clueless: I think this was a unique moment
p36
aVwhen the beautiful naivety of Twitter
p37
aVwas hitting the increasingly horrific reality.
p38
aa(lp39
VAnd here were some of the Tweets that were cascading into his eye line,
p40
aVas he was trying to apologize:
p41
aa(lp42
V"Jonah Lehrer, boring us into forgiving him."
p43
aV(Laughter)
p44
aa(lp45
VAnd, "Jonah Lehrer has not proven that he is capable of feeling shame."
p46
aa(lp47
VThat one must have been written by the best psychiatrist ever,
p48
aVto know that about such a tiny figure behind a lectern.
p49
aa(lp50
VAnd, "Jonah Lehrer is just a frigging sociopath."
p51
aa(lp52
VThat last word is a very human thing to do, to dehumanize the people we hurt.
p53
aVIt's because we want to destroy people but not feel bad about it.
p54
aVImagine if this was an actual court,
p55
aVand the accused was in the dark, begging for another chance,
p56
aVand the jury was yelling out,
p57
aV"Bored! Sociopath!"
p58
aV(Laughter)
p59
aa(lp60
VYou know, when we watch courtroom dramas, we tend to identify
p61
aVwith the kindhearted defense attorney,
p62
aVbut give us the power, and we become like hanging judges.
p63
aa(lp64
VPower shifts fast.
p65
aVWe were getting Jonah because he was perceived to have misused his privilege,
p66
aVbut Jonah was on the floor then, and we were still kicking,
p67
aVand congratulating ourselves for punching up.
p68
aVAnd it began to feel weird and empty when there wasn't a powerful person
p69
aVwho had misused their privilege that we could get.
p70
aVA day without a shaming began to feel like a day
p71
aVpicking fingernails and treading water.
p72
aa(lp73
VLet me tell you a story.
p74
aVIt's about a woman called Justine Sacco.
p75
aVShe was a PR woman from New York with 170 Twitter followers,
p76
aVand she'd Tweet little acerbic jokes to them,
p77
aVlike this one on a plane from New York to London:
p78
aV[Weird German Dude: You're in first class. It's 2014. Get some deodorant."
p79
aV-Inner monologue as inhale BO. Thank god for pharmaceuticals.]
p80
aVSo Justine chuckled to herself, and pressed send, and got no replies,
p81
aVand felt that sad feeling that we all feel
p82
aVwhen the Internet doesn't congratulate us for being funny.
p83
aV(Laughter)
p84
aVBlack silence when the Internet doesn't talk back.
p85
aVAnd then she got to Heathrow, and she had a little time to spare
p86
aVbefore her final leg, so she thought up another funny little acerbic joke:
p87
aa(lp88
V[Going to Africa. Hope I don't get AIDS. Just kidding. I'm white!]
p89
aa(lp90
VAnd she chuckled to herself, pressed send, got on the plane, got no replies,
p91
aVturned off her phone, fell asleep,
p92
aVwoke up 11 hours later,
p93
aVturned on her phone while the plane was taxiing on the runway,
p94
aVand straightaway there was a message from somebody
p95
aVthat she hadn't spoken to since high school,
p96
aVthat said, "I am so sorry to see what's happening to you."
p97
aVAnd then another message from a best friend,
p98
aV"You need to call me right now.
p99
aVYou are the worldwide number one trending topic on Twitter."
p100
aV(Laughter)
p101
aa(lp102
VWhat had happened is that one of her 170 followers had sent the Tweet
p103
aVto a Gawker journalist, and he retweeted it to his 15,000 followers:
p104
aV[And now, a funny holiday joke from IAC's PR boss]
p105
aVAnd then it was like a bolt of lightning.
p106
aVA few weeks later, I talked to the Gawker journalist.
p107
aVI emailed him and asked him how it felt, and he said, "It felt delicious."
p108
aVAnd then he said, "But I'm sure she's fine."
p109
aa(lp110
VBut she wasn't fine, because while she slept,
p111
aVTwitter took control of her life and dismantled it piece by piece.
p112
aVFirst there were the philanthropists:
p113
aV[If @JustineSacco's unfortunate words ... bother you,
p114
aVjoin me in supporting @CARE's work in Africa.]
p115
aV[In light of ... disgusting, racist tweet, I'm donating to @care today]
p116
aVThen came the beyond horrified:
p117
aV[... no words for that horribly disgusting racist as fuck tweet from Justine Sacco.
p118
aVI am beyond horrified.]
p119
aa(lp120
VWas anybody on Twitter that night? A few of you.
p121
aVDid Justine's joke overwhelm your Twitter feed the way it did mine?
p122
aVIt did mine, and I thought what everybody thought that night,
p123
aVwhich was, "Wow, somebody's screwed!
p124
aVSomebody's life is about to get terrible!"
p125
aVAnd I sat up in my bed,
p126
aVand I put the pillow behind my head,
p127
aVand then I thought, I'm not entirely sure that joke was intended to be racist.
p128
aVMaybe instead of gleefully flaunting her privilege,
p129
aVshe was mocking the gleeful flaunting of privilege.
p130
aVThere's a comedy tradition of this,
p131
aVlike South Park or Colbert or Randy Newman.
p132
aVMaybe Justine Sacco's crime was not being as good at it as Randy Newman.
p133
aVIn fact, when I met Justine a couple of weeks later in a bar,
p134
aVshe was just crushed,
p135
aVand I asked her to explain the joke,
p136
aVand she said, "Living in America puts us in a bit of a bubble
p137
aVwhen it comes to what is going on in the Third World.
p138
aVI was making of fun of that bubble."
p139
aa(lp140
VYou know, another woman on Twitter that night, a New Statesman writer Helen Lewis,
p141
aVshe reviewed my book on public shaming and wrote that she Tweeted that night,
p142
aV"I'm not sure that her joke was intended to be racist,"
p143
aVand she said straightaway she got a fury of Tweets saying,
p144
aV"Well, you're just a privileged bitch, too."
p145
aVAnd so to her shame, she wrote,
p146
aVshe shut up and watched as Justine's life got torn apart.
p147
aa(lp148
VIt started to get darker:
p149
aV[Everyone go report this cunt @JustineSacco]
p150
aVThen came the calls for her to be fired.
p151
aV[Good luck with the job hunt in the new year. #GettingFired]
p152
aVThousands of people around the world
p153
aVdecided it was their duty to get her fired.
p154
aV[@JustineSacco last tweet of your career. #SorryNotSorry
p155
aVCorporations got involved, hoping to sell their products
p156
aVon the back of Justine's annihilation:
p157
aV[Next time you plan to tweet something stupid before you take off,
p158
aVmake sure you are getting on a @Gogo flight!]
p159
aV(Laughter)
p160
aa(lp161
VA lot of companies were making good money that night.
p162
aVYou know, Justine's name was normally Googled 40 times a month.
p163
aVThat month, between December the 20th and the end of December,
p164
aVher name was Googled 1,220,000 times.
p165
aVAnd one Internet economist told me that that meant that Google made
p166
aVsomewhere between 120,000 dollars and 468,000 dollars
p167
aVfrom Justine's annihilation, whereas those of us doing the actual shaming \u2014
p168
aVwe got nothing.
p169
aV(Laughter)
p170
aVWe were like unpaid shaming interns for Google.
p171
aV(Laughter)
p172
aa(lp173
VAnd then came the trolls:
p174
aV[I'm actually kind of hoping Justine Sacco gets aids? lol]
p175
aVSomebody else on that wrote,
p176
aV"Somebody HIV-positive should rape this bitch and then we'll find out
p177
aVif her skin color protects her from AIDS."
p178
aVAnd that person got a free pass.
p179
aVNobody went after that person.
p180
aVWe were all so excited about destroying Justine,
p181
aVand our shaming brains are so simple-minded,
p182
aVthat we couldn't also handle destroying somebody
p183
aVwho was inappropriately destroying Justine.
p184
aVJustine was really uniting a lot of disparate groups that night,
p185
aVfrom philanthropists to "rape the bitch."
p186
aV[@JustineSacco I hope you get fired! You demented bitch...
p187
aVJust let the world know you're planning to ride bare back while in Africa.]
p188
aa(lp189
VWomen always have it worse than men.
p190
aVWhen a man gets shamed, it's, "I'm going to get you fired."
p191
aVWhen a woman gets shamed, it's,
p192
aV"I'm going to get you fired and raped and cut out your uterus."
p193
aa(lp194
VAnd then Justine's employers got involved:
p195
aV[IAC on @JustineSacco tweet: This is an outrageous, offensive comment.
p196
aVEmployee in question currently unreachable on an intl flight.]
p197
aVAnd that's when the anger turned to excitement:
p198
aV[All I want for Christmas is to see @JustineSacco's face when her plane lands
p199
aVand she checks her inbox/voicemail. #fired]
p200
aV[Oh man, @justinesacco is going to have the most painful
p201
aVphone-turning-on moment ever when her plane lands.]
p202
aV[We are about to watch this @JustineSacco bitch get fired. In REAL time.
p203
aVBefore she even KNOWS she's getting fired.]
p204
aVWhat we had was a delightful narrative arc.
p205
aVWe knew something that Justine didn't.
p206
aVCan you think of anything less judicial than this?
p207
aVJustine was asleep on a plane and unable to explain herself,
p208
aVand her inability was a huge part of the hilarity.
p209
aVOn Twitter that night, we were like toddlers crawling towards a gun.
p210
aVSomebody worked out exactly which plane she was on, so they linked
p211
aVto a flight tracker website.
p212
aV[British Airways Flight 43 On-time - arrives in 1 hour 34 minutes]
p213
aVA hashtag began trending worldwide:
p214
aV# hasJustineLandedYet?
p215
aV[It is kinda wild to see someone self-destruct
p216
aVwithout them even being aware of it. #hasJustineLandedYet]
p217
aV[Seriously. I just want to go home to go to bed, but everyone at the bar
p218
aVis SO into #HasJustineLandedYet. Can't look away. Can't leave.]
p219
aV[#HasJustineLandedYet may be the best thing to happen to my Friday night.]
p220
aV[Is no one in Cape Town going to the airport to tweet her arrival?
p221
aVCome on, twitter! I'd like pictures]
p222
aVAnd guess what? Yes there was.
p223
aV[@JustineSacco HAS in fact landed at Cape Town international.
p224
aVAnd if you want to know what it looks like to discover
p225
aVthat you've just been torn to shreds because of a misconstrued liberal joke,
p226
aVnot by trolls, but by nice people like us,
p227
aVthis is what it looks like:
p228
aV[... She's decided to wear sunnies as a disguise.]
p229
aa(lp230
VSo why did we do it?
p231
aVI think some people were genuinely upset,
p232
aVbut I think for other people,
p233
aVit's because Twitter is basically a mutual approval machine.
p234
aVWe surround ourselves with people who feel the same way we do,
p235
aVand we approve each other,
p236
aVand that's a really good feeling.
p237
aVAnd if somebody gets in the way, we screen them out.
p238
aVAnd do you know what that's the opposite of?
p239
aVIt's the opposite of democracy.
p240
aVWe wanted to show that we cared about people dying of AIDS in Africa.
p241
aVOur desire to be seen to be compassionate is what led us to commit
p242
aVthis profoundly un-compassionate act.
p243
aVAs Meghan O'Gieblyn wrote in the Boston Review,
p244
aV"This isn't social justice. It's a cathartic alternative."
p245
aa(lp246
VFor the past three years,
p247
aVI've been going around the world meeting people like Justine Sacco \u2014
p248
aVand believe me, there's a lot of people like Justine Sacco.
p249
aVThere's more every day.
p250
aVAnd we want to think they're fine, but they're not fine.
p251
aVThe people I met were mangled.
p252
aVThey talked to me about depression,
p253
aVand anxiety and insomnia and suicidal thoughts.
p254
aVOne woman I talked to, who also told a joke that landed badly,
p255
aVshe stayed home for a year and a half.
p256
aVBefore that, she worked with adults with learning difficulties,
p257
aVand was apparently really good at her job.
p258
aa(lp259
VJustine was fired, of course, because social media demanded it.
p260
aVBut it was worse than that.
p261
aVShe was losing herself.
p262
aVShe was waking up in the middle of the night, forgetting who she was.
p263
aVShe was got because she was perceived to have misused her privilege.
p264
aVAnd of course, that's a much better thing to get people for than the things
p265
aVwe used to get people for, like having children out of wedlock.
p266
aVBut the phrase "misuse of privilege" is becoming a free pass
p267
aVto tear apart pretty much anybody we choose to.
p268
aVIt's becoming a devalued term,
p269
aVand it's making us lose our capacity for empathy
p270
aVand for distinguishing between serious and unserious transgressions.
p271
aa(lp272
VJustine had 170 Twitter followers, and so to make it work,
p273
aVshe had to be fictionalized.
p274
aVWord got around that she was the daughter the mining billionaire Desmond Sacco.
p275
aV[Let us not be fooled by #JustineSacco her father is a SA mining billionaire.
p276
aVShe's not sorry. And neither is her father.]
p277
aVI thought that was true about Justine,
p278
aVuntil I met her at a bar, and I asked her about her billionaire father,
p279
aVand she said, "My father sells carpets."
p280
aa(lp281
VAnd I think back on the early days of Twitter,
p282
aVwhen people would admit shameful secrets about themselves,
p283
aVand other people would say, "Oh my God, I'm exactly the same."
p284
aVThese days, the hunt is on for people's shameful secrets.
p285
aVYou can lead a good, ethical life,
p286
aVbut some bad phraseology in a Tweet can overwhelm it all,
p287
aVbecome a clue to your secret inner evil.
p288
aa(lp289
VMaybe there's two types of people in the world:
p290
aVthose people who favor humans over ideology,
p291
aVand those people who favor ideology over humans.
p292
aVI favor humans over ideology,
p293
aVbut right now, the ideologues are winning,
p294
aVand they're creating a stage for constant artificial high dramas
p295
aVwhere everybody's either a magnificent hero
p296
aVor a sickening villain,
p297
aVeven though we know that's not true about our fellow humans.
p298
aVWhat's true is that we are clever and stupid;
p299
aVwhat's true is that we're grey areas.
p300
aVThe great thing about social media was how it gave a voice
p301
aVto voiceless people,
p302
aVbut we're now creating a surveillance society,
p303
aVwhere the smartest way to survive is to go back to being voiceless.
p304
aa(lp305
VLet's not do that.
p306
aa(lp307
VThank you.
p308
aa(lp309
V(Applause)
p310
aa(lp311
VBruno Giussani: Thank you, Jon.
p312
aa(lp313
VJon Ronson: Thanks, Bruno.
p314
aa(lp315
VBG: Don't go away.
p316
aVWhat strikes me about Justine's story
p317
aVis also the fact that if you Google her name today,
p318
aVthis story covers the first 100 pages of Google results \u2014
p319
aVthere is nothing else about her.
p320
aVIn your book, you mention another story
p321
aVof another victim who actually got taken on by a reputation management firm,
p322
aVand by creating blogs and posting nice, innocuous stories about her love for cats
p323
aVand holidays and stuff, managed to get the story
p324
aVoff the first couple pages of Google results, but it didn't last long.
p325
aVA couple of weeks later, they started creeping back up to the top result.
p326
aVIs this a totally lost battle?
p327
aa(lp328
VJon Ronson: You know, I think the very best thing we can do,
p329
aVif you see a kind of unfair or an ambiguous shaming,
p330
aVis to speak up, because I think the worst thing that happened to Justine
p331
aVwas that nobody supported her \u2014 like, everyone was against her,
p332
aVand that is profoundly traumatizing,
p333
aVto be told by tens of thousands of people that you need to get out.
p334
aVBut if a shaming happens and there's a babble of voices, like in a democracy,
p335
aVwhere people are discussing it, I think that's much less damaging.
p336
aVSo I think that's the way forward,
p337
aVbut it's hard, because if you do stand up for somebody,
p338
aVit's incredibly unpleasant.
p339
aa(lp340
VBG: So let's talk about your experience,
p341
aVbecause you stood up by writing this book.
p342
aVBy the way, it's mandatory reading for everybody, okay?
p343
aVYou stood up because the book actually puts the spotlight on shamers.
p344
aVAnd I assume you didn't only have friendly reactions on Twitter.
p345
aa(lp346
VJR: It didn't go down that well with some people.
p347
aV(Laughter)
p348
aVI mean, you don't want to just concentrate \u2014
p349
aVbecause lots of people understood, and were really nice about the book.
p350
aVBut yeah, for 30 years I've been writing stories about abuses of power,
p351
aVand when I say the powerful people over there in the military,
p352
aVor in the pharmaceutical industry, everybody applauds me.
p353
aVAs soon as I say, "We are the powerful people abusing our power now,"
p354
aVI get people saying, "Well you must be a racist too."
p355
aa(lp356
VBG: So the other night \u2014 yesterday \u2014 we were at dinner,
p357
aVand there were two discussions going on.
p358
aVOn one side you were talking with people around the table \u2014
p359
aVand that was a nice, constructive discussion.
p360
aVOn the other, every time you turned to your phone,
p361
aVthere is this deluge of insults.
p362
aa(lp363
VJR: Yeah. This happened last night. We had like a TED dinner last night.
p364
aVWe were chatting and it was lovely and nice, and I decided to check Twitter.
p365
aVSomebody said, "You are a white supremacist."
p366
aVAnd then I went back and had a nice conversation with somebody,
p367
aVand then I went back to Twitter,
p368
aVsomebody said my very existence made the world a worse place.
p369
aVMy friend Adam Curtis says
p370
aVthat maybe the Internet is like a John Carpenter movie from the 1980s,
p371
aVwhen eventually everyone will start screaming at each other
p372
aVand shooting each other, and then eventually everybody
p373
aVwould flee to somewhere safer,
p374
aVand I'm starting to think of that as a really nice option.
p375
aa(lp376
VBG: Jon, thank you. JR: Thank you, Bruno.
