VWhen I was young, I prided myself as a nonconformist
p4
aVin the conservative U.S. state I live in, Kansas.
p5
aVI didn't follow along with the crowd.
p6
aVI wasn't afraid to try weird clothing trends or hairstyles.
p7
aVI was outspoken and extremely social.
p8
aVEven these pictures and postcards  of my London semester abroad 16 years ago
p9
aVshow that I obviously didn't care if I was perceived as weird or different.
p10
aV(Laughter)
p11
aa(lp12
VBut that same year  I was in London, 16 years ago,
p13
aVI realized something about myself that actually was somewhat unique,
p14
aVand that changed everything.
p15
aVI became the opposite of who I thought I once was.
p16
aVI stayed in my room instead of socializing.
p17
aVI stopped engaging in clubs and leadership activities.
p18
aVI didn't want to stand out in the crowd anymore.
p19
aVI told myself it was because I was growing up and maturing,
p20
aVnot that I was suddenly looking for acceptance.
p21
aVI had always assumed I was immune to needing acceptance.
p22
aVAfter all, I was a bit unconventional.
p23
aVBut I realize now
p24
aVthat the moment I realized something was different about me
p25
aVwas the exact same moment that I began conforming and hiding.
p26
aa(lp27
VHiding is a progressive habit,
p28
aVand once you start hiding,
p29
aVit becomes harder and harder to step forward and speak out.
p30
aVIn fact, even now,
p31
aVwhen I was talking to people about what this talk was about,
p32
aVI made up a cover story
p33
aVand I even hid the truth about my TED Talk.
p34
aVSo it is fitting and scary
p35
aVthat I have returned  to this city 16 years later
p36
aVand I have chosen this stage to finally stop hiding.
p37
aVWhat have I been hiding for 16 years?
p38
aVI am a lesbian.
p39
aa(lp40
V(Applause)
p41
aa(lp42
VThank you.
p43
aa(lp44
VI've struggled to say those words,
p45
aVbecause I didn't want to be defined by them.
p46
aVEvery time I would think about coming out in the past,
p47
aVI would think to myself, but I just want to be known as Morgana,
p48
aVuniquely Morgana,
p49
aVbut not "my lesbian friend Morgana," or "my gay coworker Morgana."
p50
aVJust Morgana.
p51
aa(lp52
VFor those of you from large metropolitan areas,
p53
aVthis may not seem like a big deal to you.
p54
aVIt may seem strange  that I have suppressed the truth
p55
aVand hidden this for so long.
p56
aVBut I was paralyzed by my fear of not being accepted.
p57
aVAnd I'm not alone, of course.
p58
aVA 2013 Deloitte study found that a surprisingly large number of people
p59
aVhide aspects of their identity.
p60
aVOf all the employees they surveyed,
p61
aV61 percent reported changing an aspect of their behavior or their appearance
p62
aVin order to fit in at work.
p63
aVOf all the gay, lesbian and bisexual employees,
p64
aV83 percent admitted to changing some aspects of themselves
p65
aVso they would not  appear at work "too gay."
p66
aVThe study found that even in companies
p67
aVwith diversity policies and inclusion programs,
p68
aVemployees struggle to be themselves at work
p69
aVbecause they believe  conformity is critical
p70
aVto their long-term career advancement.
p71
aVAnd while I was surprised that so many people just like me
p72
aVwaste so much energy trying to hide themselves,
p73
aVI was scared when I discovered that my silence
p74
aVhas life-or-death consequences and long-term social repercussions.
p75
aa(lp76
VTwelve years:
p77
aVthe length by which  life expectancy is shortened
p78
aVfor gay, lesbian and bisexual people in highly anti-gay communities
p79
aVcompared to accepting communities.
p80
aVTwelve years reduced life expectancy.
p81
aVWhen I read that in The Advocate  magazine this year,
p82
aVI realized I could no longer afford to keep silent.
p83
aVThe effects of personal stress and social stigmas are a deadly combination.
p84
aVThe study found that gays in anti-gay communities
p85
aVhad higher rates of heart disease, violence and suicide.
p86
aVWhat I once thought was simply a personal matter
p87
aVI realized had a ripple effect
p88
aVthat went into the workplace and out into the community
p89
aVfor every story just like mine.
p90
aVMy choice to hide and not share who I really am
p91
aVmay have inadvertently contributed to this exact same environment
p92
aVand atmosphere of discrimination.
p93
aa(lp94
VI'd always told myself there's no reason to share that I was gay,
p95
aVbut the idea that my silence has social consequences
p96
aVwas really driven home this year when I missed an opportunity
p97
aVto change the atmosphere of discrimination in my own home state of Kansas.
p98
aa(lp99
VIn February, the Kansas House of  Representatives brought up a bill for vote
p100
aVthat would have essentially allowed businesses
p101
aVto use religious freedom as a reason to deny gays services.
p102
aVA former coworker and friend of mine
p103
aVhas a father who serves in the Kansas House of Representatives.
p104
aVHe voted in favor of the bill,
p105
aVin favor of a law that would allow  businesses to not serve me.
p106
aa(lp107
VHow does my friend feel
p108
aVabout lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and questioning people?
p109
aVHow does her father feel?
p110
aVI don't know, because I was never honest  with them about who I am.
p111
aVAnd that shakes me to the core.
p112
aVWhat if I had told her my story years ago?
p113
aVCould she have told  her father my experience?
p114
aVCould I have ultimately helped change his vote?
p115
aVI will never know,
p116
aVand that made me realize I had done nothing
p117
aVto try to make a difference.
p118
aa(lp119
VHow ironic that I work in human resources,
p120
aVa profession that works to welcome,
p121
aVconnect and encourage the development of employees,
p122
aVa profession that advocates that the diversity of society
p123
aVshould be reflected in the workplace,
p124
aVand yet I have done nothing to advocate for diversity.
p125
aVWhen I came to this company one year ago,
p126
aVI thought to myself, this company  has anti-discrimination policies
p127
aVthat protect gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people.
p128
aVTheir commitment to diversity is evident through their global inclusion programs.
p129
aVWhen I walk through the doors of this company, I will finally come out.
p130
aVBut I didn't.
p131
aVInstead of taking advantage of the opportunity,
p132
aVI did nothing.
p133
aa(lp134
V(Applause)
p135
aa(lp136
VWhen I was looking through my London journal and scrapbook
p137
aVfrom my London semester abroad 16 years ago,
p138
aVI came across this modified quote from Toni Morrison's book, "Paradise."
p139
aV"There are more scary things inside than outside."
p140
aVAnd then I wrote a note to myself at the bottom:
p141
aV"Remember this."
p142
aVI'm sure I was trying to encourage myself to get out and explore London,
p143
aVbut the message I missed was the need  to start exploring and embracing myself.
p144
aVWhat I didn't realize until all these years later
p145
aVis that the biggest obstacles I will ever have to overcome
p146
aVare my own fears and insecurities.
p147
aVI believe that by facing my fears inside, I will be able to change reality outside.
p148
aVI made a choice today
p149
aVto reveal a part of myself that I have hidden for too long.
p150
aVI hope that this means I will never hide again,
p151
aVand I hope that by coming out today, I can do something to change the data
p152
aVand also to help others who feel different be more themselves and more fulfilled
p153
aVin both their professional and personal lives.
p154
aVThank you.
