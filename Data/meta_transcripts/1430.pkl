VTo most of you, this is a device
p4
aVto buy, sell, play games,
p5
aVwatch videos.
p6
aVI think it might be a lifeline.
p7
aVI think actually it might be able to save more lives

aVthan penicillin.

VTexting:
p11
aVI know I say texting and a lot of you think sexting,
p12
aVa lot of you think about the lewd photos that you see \u2014
p13
aVhopefully not your kids sending to somebody else \u2014
p14
aVor trying to translate the abbreviations
p15
aVLOL, LMAO, HMU.
p16
aVI can help you with those later.
p17
aVBut the parents in the room
p18
aVknow that texting is actually
p19
aVthe best way to communicate with your kids.
p20
aVIt might be the only way to communicate with your kids.
p21
aV(Laughter)
p22
aVThe average teenager sends 3,339 text messages a month,
p23
aVunless she's a girl, then it's closer to 4,000.
p24
aVAnd the secret is she opens every single one.
p25
aVTexting has a 100 percent open rate.
p26
aVNow the parents are really alarmed.
p27
aVIt's a 100 percent open rate
p28
aVeven if she doesn't respond to you
p29
aVwhen you ask her when she's coming home for dinner.
p30
aVI promise she read that text.
p31
aVAnd this isn't some suburban iPhone-using teen phenomenon.
p32
aVTexting actually overindexes
p33
aVfor minority and urban youth.
p34
aVI know this because at DoSomething.org,
p35
aVwhich is the largest organization
p36
aVfor teenagers and social change in America,
p37
aVabout six months ago we pivoted
p38
aVand started focusing on text messaging.
p39
aVWe're now texting out to about 200,000 kids a week
p40
aVabout doing our campaigns to make their schools more green
p41
aVor to work on homeless issues and things like that.
p42
aVWe're finding it 11 times more powerful than email.
p43
aVWe've also found an unintended consequence.
p44
aVWe've been getting text messages back like these.
p45
aV"I don't want to go to school today.
p46
aVThe boys call me faggot."
p47
aV"I was cutting, my parents found out,
p48
aVand so I stopped.
p49
aVBut I just started again an hour ago."
p50
aVOr, "He won't stop raping me.
p51
aVHe told me not to tell anyone.
p52
aVIt's my dad. Are you there?"
p53
aVThat last one's an actual text message that we received.
p54
aVAnd yeah, we're there.
p55
aVI will not forget the day we got that text message.
p56
aVAnd so it was that day that we decided
p57
aVwe needed to build a crisis text hotline.
p58
aVBecause this isn't what we do.
p59
aVWe do social change.
p60
aVKids are just sending us these text messages
p61
aVbecause texting is so familiar and comfortable to them
p62
aVand there's nowhere else to turn
p63
aVthat they're sending them to us.
p64
aVSo think about it, a text hotline; it's pretty powerful.
p65
aVIt's fast, it's pretty private.
p66
aVNo one hears you in a stall, you're just texting quietly.
p67
aVIt's real time.
p68
aVWe can help millions of teens with counseling and referrals.
p69
aVThat's great.
p70
aVBut the thing that really makes this awesome is the data.
p71
aVBecause I'm not really comfortable just helping that girl
p72
aVwith counseling and referrals.
p73
aVI want to prevent this shit from happening.
p74
aVSo think about a cop.
p75
aVThere's something in New York City.
p76
aVThe police did it. It used to be just guess work, police work.
p77
aVAnd then they started crime mapping.
p78
aVAnd so they started following and watching
p79
aVpetty thefts, summonses, all kinds of things \u2014
p80
aVcharting the future essentially.
p81
aVAnd they found things like,
p82
aVwhen you see crystal meth on the street,
p83
aVif you add police presence,
p84
aVyou can curb the otherwise inevitable spate
p85
aVof assaults and robberies that would happen.
p86
aVIn fact, the year after
p87
aVthe NYPD put CompStat in place,
p88
aVthe murder rate fell 60 percent.
p89
aVSo think about the data from a crisis text line.
p90
aVThere is no census on bullying and dating abuse
p91
aVand eating disorders and cutting and rape \u2014
p92
aVno census.
p93
aVMaybe there's some studies, some longitudinal studies,
p94
aVthat cost lots of money and took lots of time.
p95
aVOr maybe there's some anecdotal evidence.
p96
aVImagine having real time data
p97
aVon every one of those issues.
p98
aVYou could inform legislation.
p99
aVYou could inform school policy.
p100
aVYou could say to a principal,
p101
aV"You're having a problem every Thursday at three o'clock.
p102
aVWhat's going on in your school?"
p103
aVYou could see the immediate impact of legislation
p104
aVor a hateful speech that somebody gives in a school assembly
p105
aVand see what happens as a result.
p106
aVThis is really, to me,
p107
aVthe power of texting and the power of data.
p108
aVBecause while people are talking about data,
p109
aVmaking it possible for Facebook
p110
aVto mine my friend from the third grade,
p111
aVor Target to know when it's time for me to buy more diapers,
p112
aVor some dude to build a better baseball team,
p113
aVI'm actually really excited about the power of data and the power of texting
p114
aVto help that kid go to school,
p115
aVto help that girl stop cutting in the bathroom
p116
aVand absolutely to help that girl whose father's raping her.
p117
aVThank you.
p118
