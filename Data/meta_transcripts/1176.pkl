VYou know, what I do is write for children,
p4
aVand I'm probably America's
p5
aVmost widely read children's author, in fact.
p6
aVAnd I always tell people
p7
aVthat I don't want to show up looking like a scientist.
p8
aVYou can have me as a farmer, or in leathers,
p9
aVand no one has ever chose farmer.
p10
aVI'm here today to talk to you
p11
aVabout circles and epiphanies.
p12
aVAnd you know, an epiphany
p13
aVis usually something you find that you dropped someplace.
p14
aVYou've just got to go around the block
p15
aVto see it as an epiphany.
p16
aa(lp17
VThat's a painting of a circle.
p18
aVA friend of mine did that \u2014 Richard Bollingbroke.
p19
aVIt's the kind of complicated circle
p20
aVthat I'm going to tell you about.
p21
aVMy circle began back in the '60s
p22
aVin high school in Stow, Ohio
p23
aVwhere I was the class queer.
p24
aVI was the guy beaten up bloody
p25
aVevery week in the boys' room,
p26
aVuntil one teacher saved my life.
p27
aVShe saved my life by letting me go to the bathroom
p28
aVin the teachers' lounge.
p29
aVShe did it in secret.
p30
aVShe did it for three years.
p31
aVAnd I had to get out of town.
p32
aVI had a thumb, I had 85 dollars,
p33
aVand I ended up in San Francisco, California \u2014
p34
aVmet a lover \u2014
p35
aVand back in the '80s, found it necessary
p36
aVto begin work on AIDS organizations.
p37
aa(lp38
VAbout three or four years ago,
p39
aVI got a phone call in the middle of the night
p40
aVfrom that teacher, Mrs. Posten,
p41
aVwho said, "I need to see you.
p42
aVI'm disappointed
p43
aVthat we never got to know each other as adults.
p44
aVCould you please come to Ohio,
p45
aVand please bring that man
p46
aVthat I know you have found by now.
p47
aVAnd I should mention
p48
aVthat I have pancreatic cancer,
p49
aVand I'd like you to please
p50
aVbe quick about this."
p51
aa(lp52
VWell, the next day we were in Cleveland.
p53
aVWe took a look at her, we laughed, we cried,
p54
aVand we knew that she needed to be in a hospice.
p55
aVWe found her one, we got her there,
p56
aVand we took care of her
p57
aVand watched over her family,
p58
aVbecause it was necessary.
p59
aVIt's something we knew how to do.
p60
aVAnd just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult
p61
aVgot to know me,
p62
aVshe turned into a box of ashes
p63
aVand was placed in my hands.
p64
aVAnd what had happened
p65
aVwas the circle had closed,
p66
aVit had become a circle \u2014
p67
aVand that epiphany I talked about
p68
aVpresented itself.
p69
aa(lp70
VThe epiphany is
p71
aVthat death is a part of life.
p72
aVShe saved my life;
p73
aVI and my partner saved hers.
p74
aVAnd you know, that part of life needs everything
p75
aVthat the rest of life does.
p76
aVIt needs truth and beauty,
p77
aVand I'm so happy it's been mentioned so much here today.
p78
aVIt also needs \u2014
p79
aVit needs dignity,
p80
aVlove and pleasure,
p81
aVand it's our job to hand those things out.
p82
aa(lp83
VThank you.
