VI'm a believer.
p4
aVI'm a believer in global warming,
p5
aVand my record is good
p6
aVon the subject.
p7
aVBut my subject
p8
aVis national security.
p9
aVWe have to get off of oil purchased
p10
aVfrom the enemy.
p11
aVI'm talking about OPEC oil.
p12
aVAnd let me take you back
p13
aV100 years
p14
aVto 1912.
p15
aVYou're probably thinking that was my birth year.
p16
aV(Laughter)
p17
aVIt wasn't. It was 1928.
p18
aVBut go back to 1912,
p19
aV100 years ago,
p20
aVand look at that point
p21
aVwhat we, our country, was faced with.
p22
aVIt's the same energy question
p23
aVthat you're looking at today,
p24
aVbut it's different sources of fuel.
p25
aVA hundred years ago
p26
aVwe were looking at coal, of course,
p27
aVand we were looking at whale oil
p28
aVand we were looking at crude oil.
p29
aVAt that point,
p30
aVwe were looking for a fuel
p31
aVthat was cleaner,
p32
aVit was cheaper,
p33
aVand it wasn't ours though,
p34
aVit was theirs.
p35
aa(lp36
VSo at that point, 1912,
p37
aVwe selected crude oil over whale oil
p38
aVand some more coal.
p39
aVBut as we moved on
p40
aVto the period now, 100 years later,
p41
aVwe're back really
p42
aVat another decision point.
p43
aVWhat is the decision point?
p44
aVIt's what we're going to use
p45
aVin the future.
p46
aVSo from here,
p47
aVit's pretty clear to me,
p48
aVwe would prefer to have
p49
aVcleaner, cheaper,
p50
aVdomestic, ours \u2014
p51
aVand we have that, we have that \u2014
p52
aVwhich is natural gas.
p53
aa(lp54
VSo here you are,
p55
aVthat the cost of all this to the world
p56
aVis 89 million barrels of oil,
p57
aVgive or take a few barrels, every day.
p58
aVAnd the cost annually
p59
aVis three trillion dollars.
p60
aVAnd one trillion of that
p61
aVgoes to OPEC.
p62
aVThat has got to be stopped.
p63
aVNow if you look at the cost of OPEC,
p64
aVit cost seven trillion dollars \u2014
p65
aVon the Milken Institute study last year \u2014
p66
aVseven trillion dollars
p67
aVsince 1976,
p68
aVis what we paid for oil from OPEC.
p69
aVNow that includes the cost of military
p70
aVand the cost of the fuel both.
p71
aVBut it's the greatest transfer of wealth,
p72
aVfrom one group to another
p73
aVin the history of mankind.
p74
aVAnd it continues.
p75
aa(lp76
VNow when you look
p77
aVat where is the transfer of wealth,
p78
aVyou can see here
p79
aVthat we have the arrows
p80
aVgoing into the Mid-East
p81
aVand away from us.
p82
aVAnd with that,
p83
aVwe have found ourselves
p84
aVto be the world's policemen.
p85
aVWe are policing the world,
p86
aVand how are we doing that?
p87
aVI know the response to this.
p88
aVI would bet there aren't 10 percent of you in the room
p89
aVthat know how many aircraft carriers there are in the world.
p90
aVRaise your hand if you think you know.
p91
aVThere are 12.
p92
aVOne is under construction by the Chinese
p93
aVand the other 11 belong to us.
p94
aa(lp95
VWhy do we have 11 aircraft carriers?
p96
aVDo we have a corner on the market?
p97
aVAre we smarter than anybody else? I'm not sure.
p98
aVIf you look at where they're located \u2014
p99
aVand on this slide it's the red blobs on there \u2014
p100
aVthere are five that are operating in the Mid-East,
p101
aVand the rest of them are in the United States.
p102
aVThey just move back to the Mid-East and those come back.
p103
aVSo actually most of the 11 we have
p104
aVare tied up in the Mid-East.
p105
aVWhy? Why are they in the Mid-East?
p106
aVThey're there to control,
p107
aVkeep the shipping lanes open
p108
aVand make oil available.
p109
aVAnd the United States uses about 20 million barrels a day,
p110
aVwhich is about 25 percent of all the oil used
p111
aVeveryday in the world.
p112
aVAnd we're doing it with four percent of the population.
p113
aVSomehow that doesn't seem right.
p114
aVThat's not sustainable.
p115
aa(lp116
VSo where do we go from here?
p117
aVDoes that continue?
p118
aVYes, it's going to continue.
p119
aVThe slide you're looking at here
p120
aVis 1990 to 2040.
p121
aVOver that period
p122
aVyou are going to double your demand.
p123
aVAnd when you look at what we're using the oil for,
p124
aV70 percent of it
p125
aVis used for transportation fuel.
p126
aVSo when somebody says,
p127
aV"Let's go more nuclear,
p128
aVlet's go wind, let's go solar,"
p129
aVfine; I'm for anything American,
p130
aVanything American.
p131
aVBut if you're going to do anything
p132
aVabout the dependency on foreign oil,
p133
aVyou have to address transportation.
p134
aa(lp135
VSo here we are
p136
aVusing 20 million barrels a day \u2014
p137
aVproducing eight, importing 12,
p138
aVand from the 12,
p139
aVfive comes from OPEC.
p140
aVWhen you look at the biggest user and the second largest user,
p141
aVwe use 20 million barrels
p142
aVand the Chinese use 10.
p143
aVThe Chinese have a little bit better plan \u2014
p144
aVor they have a plan;
p145
aVwe have no plan.
p146
aVIn the history of America,
p147
aVwe've never had an energy plan.
p148
aVWe don't even realize the resources
p149
aVthat we have available to us.
p150
aVIf you take the last 10 years
p151
aVand bring forward,
p152
aVyou've transferred to OPEC a trillion dollars.
p153
aVIf you go forward the next 10 years
p154
aVand cap the price of oil at 100 dollars a barrel,
p155
aVyou will pay 2.2 trillion.
p156
aVThat's not sustainable either.
p157
aa(lp158
VBut the days of cheap oil are over.
p159
aVThey're over.
p160
aVThey make it very clear to you,
p161
aVthe Saudis do,
p162
aVthey have to have 94 dollars a barrel
p163
aVto make their social commitments.
p164
aVNow I had people in Washington last week told me,
p165
aVhe said, "The Saudis can produce the oil
p166
aVfor five dollars a barrel.
p167
aVThat has nothing to do with it.
p168
aVIt's what they have to pay for
p169
aVis what we are going to pay for oil."
p170
aVThere is no free market for oil.
p171
aVThe oil is priced off the margin.
p172
aVAnd the OPEC nations
p173
aVare the ones that price the oil.
p174
aa(lp175
VSo where are we headed from here?
p176
aVWe're headed to natural gas.
p177
aVNatural gas will do everything
p178
aVwe want it to do.
p179
aVIt's 130 octane fuel.
p180
aVIt's 25 percent cleaner than oil.
p181
aVIt's ours, we have an abundance of it.
p182
aVAnd it does not require a refinery.
p183
aVIt comes out of the ground at 130 octane.
p184
aVRun it through the separator and you're ready to use it.
p185
aVIt's going to be very simple for us to use.
p186
aVIt's going to be simple to accomplish this.
p187
aVYou're going to find, and I'll tell you in just a minute,
p188
aVwhat you're looking for to make it happen.
p189
aVBut here you can look at the list.
p190
aVNatural gas will fit all of those.
p191
aVIt will replace or be able to be used for that.
p192
aVIt's for power generation, transportation,
p193
aVit's peaking fuel, it's all those.
p194
aa(lp195
VDo we have enough natural gas?
p196
aVLook at the bar on the left. It's 24 trillion.
p197
aVIt's what we use a year.
p198
aVGo forward
p199
aVand the estimates that you have
p200
aVfrom the EIA and onto the industry estimates \u2014
p201
aVthe industry knows what they're talking about \u2014
p202
aVwe've got 4,000 trillion cubic feet
p203
aVof natural gas that's available to us.
p204
aVHow does that translate
p205
aVto barrels of oil equivalent?
p206
aVIt would be three times
p207
aVwhat the Saudis claim they have.
p208
aVAnd they claim they have 250 billion barrels of oil,
p209
aVwhich I do not believe.
p210
aVI think it's probably 175 billion barrels.
p211
aVBut anyway, whether they say they're right or whatever,
p212
aVwe have plenty of natural gas.
p213
aa(lp214
VSo I have tried to target
p215
aVon where we use the natural gas.
p216
aVAnd where I've targeted
p217
aVis on the heavy-duty trucks.
p218
aVThere are eight million of them.
p219
aVYou take eight million trucks \u2014
p220
aVthese are 18-wheelers \u2014
p221
aVand take them to natural gas,
p222
aVreduce carbon by 30 percent,
p223
aVit is cheaper
p224
aVand it will cut our imports
p225
aVthree million barrels.
p226
aVSo you will cut 60 percent off of OPEC
p227
aVwith eight million trucks.
p228
aVThere are 250 million vehicles in America.
p229
aa(lp230
VSo what you have
p231
aVis natural gas is the bridge fuel,
p232
aVis the way I see it.
p233
aVI don't have to worry
p234
aVabout the bridge to where at my age.
p235
aV(Laughter)
p236
aVThat's your concern.
p237
aVBut when you look at the natural gas we have
p238
aVit could very well be
p239
aVthe bridge to natural gas,
p240
aVbecause you have plenty of natural gas.
p241
aVBut as I said, I'm for anything American.
p242
aa(lp243
VNow let me take you \u2014 I've been a realist \u2014
p244
aVI went from theorist early to realist.
p245
aVI'm back to theorist again.
p246
aVIf you look at the world,
p247
aVyou have methane hydrates in the ocean
p248
aVaround every continent.
p249
aVAnd here you can see methane,
p250
aVif that's the way you're going to go,
p251
aVthat there's plenty of methane \u2014
p252
aVnatural gas is methane,
p253
aVmethane and natural gas are interchangeable \u2014
p254
aVbut if you decide
p255
aVthat you're going to use some methane \u2014
p256
aVand I'm gone, so it's up to you \u2014
p257
aVbut we do have
p258
aVplenty of methane hydrates.
p259
aa(lp260
VSo I think I've made my point
p261
aVthat we have to get on our own resources in America.
p262
aVIf we do \u2014
p263
aVit's costing us a billion dollars a day for oil.
p264
aVAnd yet, we have no energy plan.
p265
aVSo there's nothing going on
p266
aVthat impresses me
p267
aVin Washington on that plan,
p268
aVother than I'm trying to focus
p269
aVon that eight million 18-wheelers.
p270
aVIf we could do that,
p271
aVI think we would take our first step
p272
aVto an energy plan.
p273
aVIf we did, we could see
p274
aVthat our own resources are easier to use
p275
aVthan anybody can imagine.
p276
aa(lp277
VThank you.
p278
aa(lp279
V(Applause)
p280
aa(lp281
VChris Anderson: Thanks for that.
p282
aVSo from your point of view,
p283
aVyou had this great Pickens Plan
p284
aVthat was based on wind energy,
p285
aVand you abandoned it basically
p286
aVbecause the economics changed.
p287
aVWhat happened?
p288
aa(lp289
VTBP: I lost 150 million dollars.
p290
aV(Laughter)
p291
aVThat'll make you abandon something.
p292
aVNo, what happened to us, Chris,
p293
aVis that power, it's priced off the margin.
p294
aVAnd so the margin is natural gas.
p295
aVAnd at the time I went into the wind business,
p296
aVnatural gas was nine dollars.
p297
aVToday it's two dollars and forty cents.
p298
aVYou cannot do a wind deal
p299
aVunder six dollars an MCF.
p300
aa(lp301
VCA: So what happened was
p302
aVthat, through increased ability
p303
aVto use fracking technology,
p304
aVthe calculated reserves of natural gas kind of exploded
p305
aVand the price plummeted,
p306
aVwhich made wind uncompetitive.
p307
aVIn a nutshell that's what happened?
p308
aa(lp309
VTBP: That's what happened.
p310
aVWe found out that we could go to the source rock,
p311
aVwhich were the carboniferous shales in the basins.
p312
aVThe first one was Barnett Shale in Texas
p313
aVand then the Marcellus up in the Northeast
p314
aVacross New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia;
p315
aVand Haynesville in Louisiana.
p316
aVThis stuff is everywhere.
p317
aVWe are overwhelmed with natural gas.
p318
aa(lp319
VCA: And now you're a big investor in that and bringing that to market?
p320
aa(lp321
VTBP: Well you say a big investor.
p322
aVIt's my life.
p323
aVI'm a geologist, got out of school in '51,
p324
aVand I've been in the industry my entire life.
p325
aVNow I do own stocks.
p326
aVI'm not a big natural gas producer.
p327
aVSomebody the other day said
p328
aVI was the second largest natural gas producer in the United States.
p329
aVDon't I wish.
p330
aVBut no, I'm not. I own stocks.
p331
aVBut I also am in the fueling business.
p332
aa(lp333
VCA: But natural gas is a fossil fuel.
p334
aVYou burn it,
p335
aVyou release CO2.
p336
aVSo you believe in the threat of climate change.
p337
aVWhy doesn't that prospect
p338
aVconcern you?
p339
aa(lp340
VTBP: Well you're going to have to use something.
p341
aVWhat do you have to replace it?
p342
aV(Laughter)
p343
aa(lp344
VCA: No, no. The argument that it's a bridge fuel makes sense,
p345
aVbecause the amount of CO2 per unit of energy
p346
aVis lower than oil and coal, correct?
p347
aVAnd so everyone can be at least happy
p348
aVto see a shift from coal or oil to natural gas.
p349
aVBut if that's it
p350
aVand that becomes the reason
p351
aVthat renewables don't get invested in,
p352
aVthen, long-term, we're screwed anyway, right?
p353
aa(lp354
VTBP: Well I'm not ready to give up,
p355
aVbut Jim and I talked
p356
aVthere as he left,
p357
aVand I said, "How do you feel about natural gas?"
p358
aVAnd he said, "Well it's a bridge fuel, is what it is."
p359
aVAnd I said, "Bridge to what?
p360
aVWhere are we headed?"
p361
aVSee but again, I told you, I don't have to worry with that.
p362
aVYou all do.
p363
aa(lp364
VCA: But I don't think that's right, Boone.
p365
aVI think you're a person who believes in your legacy.
p366
aVYou've made the money you need.
p367
aVYou're one of the few people in a position
p368
aVto really swing the debate.
p369
aVDo you support the idea of some kind of price on carbon?
p370
aVDoes that make sense?
p371
aa(lp372
VTBP: I don't like that
p373
aVbecause it ends up the government is going to run the program.
p374
aVI can tell you it will be a failure.
p375
aVThe government is not successful
p376
aVon these things.
p377
aVThey just aren't, it's a bad deal.
p378
aVLook at Solyndra, or whatever it was.
p379
aVI mean, that was told to be a bad idea 10 times,
p380
aVthey went ahead and did it anyway.
p381
aVBut that only blew out 500 million.
p382
aVI think it's closer to a billion.
p383
aVBut Chris, I think where we're headed,
p384
aVthe long-term,
p385
aVI don't mind going back to nuclear.
p386
aVAnd I can tell you what the last page
p387
aVof the report that will take them five years to write
p388
aVwill be.
p389
aVOne, don't build a reformer on a fault.
p390
aV(Laughter)
p391
aVAnd number two,
p392
aVdo not build a reformer on the ocean.
p393
aVAnd now I think reformers are safe.
p394
aVMove them inland
p395
aVand on very stable ground
p396
aVand build the reformers.
p397
aVThere isn't anything wrong with nuke.
p398
aVYou're going to have to have energy. There is no question.
p399
aVYou can't \u2014 okay.
p400
aa(lp401
VCA: One of the questions from the audience
p402
aVis, with fracking and the natural gas process,
p403
aVwhat about the problem of methane leaking from that,
p404
aVmethane being a worse global warming gas
p405
aVthan CO2?
p406
aVIs that a concern?
p407
aa(lp408
VTBP: Fracking? What is fracking?
p409
aa(lp410
VCA: Fracking.
p411
aa(lp412
VTBP: I'm teasing.
p413
aa(lp414
V(Laughter)
p415
aa(lp416
VCA: We've got a little bit of accent incompatibility here, you know.
p417
aa(lp418
VTBP: No, let me tell you,
p419
aVI've told you what my age was.
p420
aVI got out of school in '51.
p421
aVI witnessed my first frack job
p422
aVat border Texas in 1953.
p423
aVFracking came out in '47,
p424
aVand don't believe for a minute
p425
aVwhen our president gets up there
p426
aVand says the Department of Energy 30 years ago
p427
aVdeveloped fracking.
p428
aVI don't know what in the hell he's talking about.
p429
aVI mean seriously, the Department of Energy
p430
aVdid not have anything to do with fracking.
p431
aVThe first frack job was in '47.
p432
aVI saw my first one in '53.
p433
aVI've fracked over 3,000 wells in my life.
p434
aVNever had a problem
p435
aVwith messing up an aquifer or anything else.
p436
aVNow the largest aquifer in North America
p437
aVis from Midland, Texas to the South Dakota border,
p438
aVacross eight states \u2014
p439
aVbig aquifer:
p440
aVOgallala, Triassic age.
p441
aVThere had to have been 800,000 wells fracked
p442
aVin Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas
p443
aVin that aquifer.
p444
aVThere's no problems.
p445
aVI don't understand why
p446
aVthe media is focused on Eastern Pennsylvania.
p447
aa(lp448
VCA: All right, so you don't support a carbon tax of any kind
p449
aVor a price on carbon.
p450
aVYour picture then I guess
p451
aVof how the world eventually gets off fossil fuels
p452
aVis through innovation ultimately,
p453
aVthat we'll someday make solar and nuclear cost competitive?
p454
aa(lp455
VTBP: Solar and wind, Jim and I agreed on that in 13 seconds.
p456
aVThat is, it's going to be a small part,
p457
aVbecause you can't rely on it.
p458
aa(lp459
VCA: So how does the world get off fossil fuels?
p460
aa(lp461
VTBP: How do we get there?
p462
aVWe have so much natural gas,
p463
aVa day will not come
p464
aVwhere you say, "Well let's don't use that anymore."
p465
aVYou'll keep using it. It is the cleanest of all.
p466
aVAnd if you look at California,
p467
aVthey use 2,500 buses.
p468
aVLAMTA have been on natural gas
p469
aVfor 25 years.
p470
aVThe Ft. Worth T
p471
aVhas been on it for 25 years.
p472
aVWhy? Air quality was the reason they used natural gas
p473
aVand got away from diesel.
p474
aVWhy are all the trash trucks today in Southern California
p475
aVon natural gas?
p476
aVIt's because of air quality.
p477
aVI know what you're telling me, and I'm not disagreeing with you.
p478
aVHow in the hell can we get off the natural gas at some point?
p479
aVAnd I say, that is your problem.
p480
aa(lp481
V(Laughter)
p482
aa(lp483
