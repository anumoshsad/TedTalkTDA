VI was offered a position as associate professor of medicine
p4
aVand chief of scientific visualization
p5
aVat Yale University
p6
aVin the department of medicine.
p7
aVAnd my job was to write many of the algorithms and code
p8
aVfor NASA to do virtual surgery
p9
aVin preparation for the astronauts going into deep-space flight,
p10
aVso they could be kept in robotic pods.
p11
aVOne of the fascinating things about what we were working on
p12
aVis that we were seeing, using new scanning technologies,
p13
aVthings that had never been seen before.
p14
aVNot only in disease management,
p15
aVbut also things that allowed us to see things about the body
p16
aVthat just made you marvel.
p17
aa(lp18
VI remember one of the first times we were looking at collagen.
p19
aVAnd your entire body, everything \u2014
p20
aVyour hair, skin, bone, nails \u2014
p21
aVeverything is made of collagen.
p22
aVAnd it's a kind of rope-like structure that twirls and swirls like this.
p23
aVAnd the only place that collagen changes its structure
p24
aVis in the cornea of your eye.
p25
aVIn your eye, it becomes a grid formation,
p26
aVand therefore, it becomes transparent, as opposed to opaque.
p27
aVSo perfectly organized a structure,
p28
aVit was hard not to attribute divinity to it.
p29
aVBecause we kept on seeing this in different parts of the body.
p30
aa(lp31
VOne of the opportunities I had
p32
aVwas one person was working on a really interesting
p33
aVmicromagnetic resonance imaging machine with the NIH.
p34
aVAnd what we were going to do
p35
aVwas scan a new project
p36
aVon the development of the fetus from conception to birth
p37
aVusing these new technologies.
p38
aVSo I wrote the algorithms and code,
p39
aVand he built the hardware \u2014 Paul Lauterbur \u2014
p40
aVthen went onto win the Nobel Prize for inventing the MRI.
p41
aVI got the data.
p42
aVAnd I'm going to show you a sample of the piece,
p43
aV"From Conception to Birth."

VAlexander Tsiaras: Thank you.
p101
aVBut as you can see,
p102
aVwhen you actually start working on this data,
p103
aVit's pretty spectacular.
p104
aVAnd as we kept on scanning more and more,
p105
aVworking on this project,
p106
aVlooking at these two simple cells
p107
aVthat have this unbelievable machinery that will become the magic of you.
p108
aVAnd as we kept on working on this data,
p109
aVlooking at small clusters of the body,
p110
aVthese little pieces of tissue
p111
aVthat were the trophoblasts coming off of the blastocyst,
p112
aVall of a sudden burrowing itself into the side of the uterus,
p113
aVsaying, "I'm here to stay."
p114
aVHaving conversation and communications
p115
aVwith the estrogens, the progesterones,
p116
aVsaying, "I'm here to stay, plant me,"
p117
aVbuilding this incredible trilinear fetus
p118
aVthat becomes, within 44 days, something that you can recognize,
p119
aVand then at nine weeks is really kind of a little human being.
p120
aVThe marvel of this information:
p121
aVHow do we actually have this biological mechanism
p122
aVinside our body
p123
aVto actually see this information?
p124
aa(lp125
VI'm going to show you something pretty unique.
p126
aVHere's a human heart at 25 days.
p127
aVIt's just basically two strands.
p128
aVAnd like this magnificent origami,
p129
aVcells are developing at one million cells per second at four weeks,
p130
aVas it's just folding on itself.
p131
aVWithin five weeks, you start to see the early atrium and the early ventricles.
p132
aVSix weeks, these folds are now beginning
p133
aVwith the papilla on the inside of the heart
p134
aVactually being able to pull down each one of those valves in your heart
p135
aVuntil you get a mature heart \u2014
p136
aVand then basically the development of the entire human body.
p137
aVThe magic of the mechanisms inside each genetic structure
p138
aVsaying exactly where that nerve cell should go \u2014
p139
aVthe complexity of these,
p140
aVthe mathematical models of how these things are indeed done
p141
aVare beyond human comprehension.
p142
aa(lp143
VEven though I am a mathematician,
p144
aVI look at this with marvel
p145
aVof how do these instruction sets not make these mistakes
p146
aVas they build what is us?
p147
aVIt's a mystery, it's magic, it's divinity.
p148
aVThen you start to take a look at adult life.
p149
aVTake a look at this little tuft of capillaries.
p150
aVIt's just a tiny sub-substructure, microscopic.
p151
aVBut basically by the time you're nine months and you're given birth,
p152
aVyou have almost 60,000 miles of vessels inside your body.
p153
aVAnd only one mile is visible.
p154
aV59,999 miles
p155
aVthat are basically bringing nutrients and taking waste away.
p156
aVThe complexity of building that within a single system
p157
aVis, again, beyond any comprehension or any existing mathematics today.
p158
aa(lp159
VAnd then instructions set,
p160
aVfrom the brain to every other part of the body \u2014
p161
aVlook at the complexity of the folding.
p162
aVWhere does this intelligence
p163
aVof knowing that a fold can actually hold more information,
p164
aVso as you actually watch the baby's brain grow.
p165
aVAnd this is one of the things we're doing.
p166
aVWe're launching two new studies
p167
aVof scanning babies' brains from the moment they're born.
p168
aVEvery six months until they're six years old,
p169
aVwe're going to be doing about 250 children,
p170
aVwatching exactly how the gyri and the sulci of the brains fold
p171
aVto see how this magnificent development
p172
aVactually turns into memories and the marvel that is us.
p173
aa(lp174
VAnd it's not just our own existence,
p175
aVbut how does the woman's body understand
p176
aVto have genetic structure that not only builds her own,
p177
aVbut then has the understanding
p178
aVthat allows her to become
p179
aVa walking immunological, cardiovascular system
p180
aVthat basically is a mobile system
p181
aVthat can actually nurture,
p182
aVtreat this child with a kind of marvel
p183
aVthat is beyond, again, our comprehension \u2014
p184
aVthe magic that is existence, that is us?
p185
aa(lp186
VThank you.
