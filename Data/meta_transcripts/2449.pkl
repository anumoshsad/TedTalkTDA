VThere are times when I feel really quite ashamed
p4
aVto be a European.
p5
aVIn the last year,
p6
aVmore than a million people arrived in Europe in need of our help,
p7
aVand our response, frankly, has been pathetic.
p8
aa(lp9
VThere are just so many contradictions.
p10
aVWe mourn the tragic death
p11
aVof two-year-old Alan Kurdi,
p12
aVand yet, since then, more than 200 children
p13
aVhave subsequently drowned in the Mediterranean.
p14
aVWe have international treaties
p15
aVthat recognize that refugees are a shared responsibility,
p16
aVand yet we accept that tiny Lebanon
p17
aVhosts more Syrians than the whole of Europe combined.
p18
aVWe lament the existence of human smugglers,
p19
aVand yet we make that the only viable route
p20
aVto seek asylum in Europe.
p21
aVWe have labor shortages,
p22
aVand yet we exclude people who fit our economic and demographic needs
p23
aVfrom coming to Europe.
p24
aVWe proclaim our liberal values in opposition to fundamentalist Islam,
p25
aVand yet \u2014
p26
aVwe have repressive policies
p27
aVthat detain child asylum seekers,
p28
aVthat separate children from their families,
p29
aVand that seize property from refugees.
p30
aa(lp31
VWhat are we doing?
p32
aVHow has the situation come to this,
p33
aVthat we've adopted such an inhumane response to a humanitarian crisis?
p34
aa(lp35
VI don't believe it's because people don't care,
p36
aVor at least I don't want to believe it's because people don't care.
p37
aVI believe it's because our politicians lack a vision,
p38
aVa vision for how to adapt an international refugee system
p39
aVcreated over 50 years ago
p40
aVfor a changing and globalized world.
p41
aVAnd so what I want to do is take a step back
p42
aVand ask two really fundamental questions,
p43
aVthe two questions we all need to ask.
p44
aVFirst, why is the current system not working?
p45
aVAnd second, what can we do to fix it?
p46
aa(lp47
VSo the modern refugee regime
p48
aVwas created in the aftermath of the Second World War by these guys.
p49
aVIts basic aim is to ensure
p50
aVthat when a state fails, or worse, turns against its own people,
p51
aVpeople have somewhere to go,
p52
aVto live in safety and dignity until they can go home.
p53
aVIt was created precisely for situations like the situation we see in Syria today.
p54
aVThrough an international convention signed by 147 governments,
p55
aVthe 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees,
p56
aVand an international organization, UNHCR,
p57
aVstates committed to reciprocally admit people onto their territory
p58
aVwho flee conflict and persecution.
p59
aa(lp60
VBut today, that system is failing.
p61
aVIn theory, refugees have a right to seek asylum.
p62
aVIn practice, our immigration policies block the path to safety.
p63
aVIn theory, refugees have a right to a pathway to integration,
p64
aVor return to the country they've come from.
p65
aVBut in practice, they get stuck in almost indefinite limbo.
p66
aVIn theory, refugees are a shared global responsibility.
p67
aVIn practice, geography means that countries proximate the conflict
p68
aVtake the overwhelming majority of the world's refugees.
p69
aVThe system isn't broken because the rules are wrong.
p70
aVIt's that we're not applying them adequately to a changing world,
p71
aVand that's what we need to reconsider.
p72
aa(lp73
VSo I want to explain to you a little bit about how the current system works.
p74
aVHow does the refugee regime actually work?
p75
aVBut not from a top-down institutional perspective,
p76
aVrather from the perspective of a refugee.
p77
aVSo imagine a Syrian woman.
p78
aVLet's call her Amira.
p79
aVAnd Amira to me represents many of the people I've met in the region.
p80
aVAmira, like around 25 percent of the world's refugees,
p81
aVis a woman with children,
p82
aVand she can't go home because she comes from this city
p83
aVthat you see before you, Homs,
p84
aVa once beautiful and historic city
p85
aVnow under rubble.
p86
aVAnd so Amira can't go back there.
p87
aVBut Amira also has no hope of resettlement to a third country,
p88
aVbecause that's a lottery ticket
p89
aVonly available to less than one percent of the world's refugees.
p90
aa(lp91
VSo Amira and her family
p92
aVface an almost impossible choice.
p93
aVThey have three basic options.
p94
aVThe first option is that Amira can take her family to a camp.
p95
aVIn the camp, she might get assistance,
p96
aVbut there are very few prospects for Amira and her family.
p97
aVCamps are in bleak, arid locations,
p98
aVoften in the desert.
p99
aVIn the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan,
p100
aVyou can hear the shells across the border in Syria at nighttime.
p101
aVThere's restricted economic activity.
p102
aVEducation is often of poor quality.
p103
aVAnd around the world,
p104
aVsome 80 percent of refugees who are in camps
p105
aVhave to stay for at least five years.
p106
aVIt's a miserable existence,
p107
aVand that's probably why, in reality,
p108
aVonly nine percent of Syrians choose that option.
p109
aa(lp110
VAlternatively, Amira can head to an urban area
p111
aVin a neighboring country, like Amman or Beirut.
p112
aVThat's an option that about 75 percent of Syrian refugees have taken.
p113
aVBut there, there's great difficulty as well.
p114
aVRefugees in such urban areas don't usually have the right to work.
p115
aVThey don't usually get significant access to assistance.
p116
aVAnd so when Amira and her family have used up their basic savings,
p117
aVthey're left with very little and likely to face urban destitution.
p118
aa(lp119
VSo there's a third alternative,
p120
aVand it's one that increasing numbers of Syrians are taking.
p121
aVAmira can seek some hope for her family
p122
aVby risking their lives on a dangerous and perilous journey
p123
aVto another country,
p124
aVand it's that which we're seeing in Europe today.
p125
aa(lp126
VAround the world, we present refugees with an almost impossible choice
p127
aVbetween three options:
p128
aVencampment, urban destitution and dangerous journeys.
p129
aVFor refugees, that choice is the global refugee regime today.
p130
aVBut I think it's a false choice.
p131
aVI think we can reconsider that choice.
p132
aVThe reason why we limit those options
p133
aVis because we think
p134
aVthat those are the only options that are available to refugees,
p135
aVand they're not.
p136
aVPoliticians frame the issue as a zero-sum issue,
p137
aVthat if we benefit refugees, we're imposing costs on citizens.
p138
aVWe tend to have a collective assumption
p139
aVthat refugees are an inevitable cost or burden to society.
p140
aVBut they don't have to. They can contribute.
p141
aa(lp142
VSo what I want to argue
p143
aVis there are ways in which we can expand that choice set
p144
aVand still benefit everyone else:
p145
aVthe host states and communities,
p146
aVour societies and refugees themselves.
p147
aVAnd I want to suggest four ways
p148
aVwe can transform the paradigm of how we think about refugees.
p149
aVAll four ways have one thing in common:
p150
aVthey're all ways in which we take the opportunities of globalization,
p151
aVmobility and markets,
p152
aVand update the way we think about the refugee issue.
p153
aa(lp154
VThe first one I want to think about
p155
aVis the idea of enabling environments,
p156
aVand it starts from a very basic recognition
p157
aVthat refugees are human beings like everyone else,
p158
aVbut they're just in extraordinary circumstances.
p159
aVTogether with my colleagues in Oxford,
p160
aVwe've embarked on a research project in Uganda
p161
aVlooking at the economic lives of refugees.
p162
aVWe chose Uganda not because it's representative of all host countries.
p163
aVIt's not. It's exceptional.
p164
aVUnlike most host countries around the world,
p165
aVwhat Uganda has done
p166
aVis give refugees economic opportunity.
p167
aVIt gives them the right to work. It gives them freedom of movement.
p168
aVAnd the results of that are extraordinary
p169
aVboth for refugees and the host community.
p170
aVIn the capital city, Kampala,
p171
aVwe found that 21 percent of refugees own a business that employs other people,
p172
aVand 40 percent of those employees
p173
aVare nationals of the host country.
p174
aVIn other words, refugees are making jobs
p175
aVfor citizens of the host country.
p176
aVEven in the camps, we found extraordinary examples
p177
aVof vibrant, flourishing and entrepreneurial businesses.
p178
aa(lp179
VFor example, in a settlement called Nakivale,
p180
aVwe found examples of Congolese refugees
p181
aVrunning digital music exchange businesses.
p182
aVWe found a Rwandan who runs a business that's available
p183
aVto allow the youth to play computer games
p184
aVon recycled games consoles and recycled televisions.
p185
aVAgainst the odds of extreme constraint,
p186
aVrefugees are innovating,
p187
aVand the gentleman you see before you is a Congolese guy called Demou-Kay.
p188
aVDemou-Kay arrived in the settlement with very little,
p189
aVbut he wanted to be a filmmaker.
p190
aVSo with friends and colleagues, he started a community radio station,
p191
aVhe rented a video camera,
p192
aVand he's now making films.
p193
aVHe made two documentary films
p194
aVwith and for our team,
p195
aVand he's making a successful business out of very little.
p196
aVIt's those kinds of examples
p197
aVthat should guide our response to refugees.
p198
aVRather than seeing refugees
p199
aVas inevitably dependent upon humanitarian assistance,
p200
aVwe need to provide them with opportunities for human flourishing.
p201
aa(lp202
VYes, clothes, blankets, shelter, food
p203
aVare all important in the emergency phase,
p204
aVbut we need to also look beyond that.
p205
aVWe need to provide opportunities to connectivity, electricity,
p206
aVeducation, the right to work,
p207
aVaccess to capital and banking.
p208
aVAll the ways in which we take for granted
p209
aVthat we are plugged in to the global economy
p210
aVcan and should apply to refugees.
p211
aa(lp212
VThe second idea I want to discuss is economic zones.
p213
aVUnfortunately, not every host country in the world
p214
aVtakes the approach Uganda has taken.
p215
aVMost host countries don't open up their economies to refugees
p216
aVin the same way.
p217
aVBut there are still pragmatic alternative options that we can use.
p218
aa(lp219
VLast April, I traveled to Jordan with my colleague,
p220
aVthe development economist Paul Collier,
p221
aVand we brainstormed an idea while we were there
p222
aVwith the international community and the government,
p223
aVan idea to bring jobs to Syrians
p224
aVwhile supporting Jordan's national development strategy.
p225
aVThe idea is for an economic zone,
p226
aVone in which we could potentially integrate the employment of refugees
p227
aValongside the employment of Jordanian host nationals.
p228
aVAnd just 15 minutes away from the Zaatari refugee camp,
p229
aVhome to 83,000 refugees,
p230
aVis an existing economic zone
p231
aVcalled the King Hussein Bin Talal Development Area.
p232
aVThe government has spent over a hundred million dollars
p233
aVconnecting it to the electricity grid, connecting it to the road network,
p234
aVbut it lacked two things:
p235
aVaccess to labor and inward investment.
p236
aVSo what if refugees were able to work there
p237
aVrather than being stuck in camps,
p238
aVable to support their families and develop skills through vocational training
p239
aVbefore they go back to Syria?
p240
aVWe recognized that that could benefit Jordan,
p241
aVwhose development strategy requires it to make the leap
p242
aVas a middle income country to manufacturing.
p243
aVIt could benefit refugees, but it could also contribute
p244
aVto the postconflict reconstruction of Syria
p245
aVby recognizing that we need to incubate refugees
p246
aVas the best source of eventually rebuilding Syria.
p247
aa(lp248
VWe published the idea in the journal Foreign Affairs.
p249
aVKing Abdullah has picked up on the idea.
p250
aVIt was announced at the London Syria Conference two weeks ago,
p251
aVand a pilot will begin in the summer.
p252
aa(lp253
V(Applause)
p254
aa(lp255
VThe third idea that I want to put to you
p256
aVis preference matching between states and refugees
p257
aVto lead to the kinds of happy outcomes you see here in the selfie
p258
aVfeaturing Angela Merkel and a Syrian refugee.
p259
aVWhat we rarely do is ask refugees what they want, where they want to go,
p260
aVbut I'd argue we can do that
p261
aVand still make everyone better off.
p262
aVThe economist Alvin Roth has developed the idea of matching markets,
p263
aVways in which the preference ranking of the parties shapes an eventual match.
p264
aVMy colleagues Will Jones and Alex Teytelboym
p265
aVhave explored ways in which that idea could be applied to refugees,
p266
aVto ask refugees to rank their preferred destinations,
p267
aVbut also allow states to rank the types of refugees they want
p268
aVon skills criteria or language criteria
p269
aVand allow those to match.
p270
aVNow, of course you'd need to build in quotas
p271
aVon things like diversity and vulnerability,
p272
aVbut it's a way of increasing the possibilities of matching.
p273
aVThe matching idea has been successfully used
p274
aVto match, for instance, students with university places,
p275
aVto match kidney donors with patients,
p276
aVand it underlies the kind of algorithms that exist on dating websites.
p277
aVSo why not apply that to give refugees greater choice?
p278
aa(lp279
VIt could also be used at the national level,
p280
aVwhere one of the great challenges we face
p281
aVis to persuade local communities to accept refugees.
p282
aVAnd at the moment, in my country, for instance,
p283
aVwe often send engineers to rural areas and farmers to the cities,
p284
aVwhich makes no sense at all.
p285
aVSo matching markets offer a potential way to bring those preferences together
p286
aVand listen to the needs and demands of the populations that host
p287
aVand the refugees themselves.
p288
aa(lp289
VThe fourth idea I want to put to you is of humanitarian visas.
p290
aVMuch of the tragedy and chaos we've seen in Europe
p291
aVwas entirely avoidable.
p292
aVIt stems from a fundamental contradiction in Europe's asylum policy,
p293
aVwhich is the following:
p294
aVthat in order to seek asylum in Europe,
p295
aVyou have to arrive spontaneously by embarking on those dangerous journeys
p296
aVthat I described.
p297
aVBut why should those journeys be necessary in an era of the budget airline
p298
aVand modern consular capabilities?
p299
aVThey're completely unnecessary journeys,
p300
aVand last year, they led to the deaths of over 3,000 people
p301
aVon Europe's borders and within European territory.
p302
aa(lp303
VIf refugees were simply allowed
p304
aVto travel directly and seek asylum in Europe,
p305
aVwe would avoid that,
p306
aVand there's a way of doing that
p307
aVthrough something called a humanitarian visa,
p308
aVthat allows people to collect a visa at an embassy
p309
aVor a consulate in a neighboring country
p310
aVand then simply pay their own way
p311
aVthrough a ferry or a flight to Europe.
p312
aVIt costs around a thousand euros
p313
aVto take a smuggler from Turkey to the Greek islands.
p314
aVIt costs 200 euros to take a budget airline from Bodrum to Frankfurt.
p315
aVIf we allowed refugees to do that, it would have major advantages.
p316
aVIt would save lives,
p317
aVit would undercut the entire market for smugglers,
p318
aVand it would remove the chaos we see from Europe's front line
p319
aVin areas like the Greek islands.
p320
aVIt's politics that prevents us doing that rather than a rational solution.
p321
aa(lp322
VAnd this is an idea that has been applied.
p323
aVBrazil has adopted a pioneering approach
p324
aVwhere over 2,000 Syrians have been able to get humanitarian visas,
p325
aVenter Brazil, and claim refugee status on arrival in Brazil.
p326
aVAnd in that scheme, every Syrian who has gone through it
p327
aVhas received refugee status and been recognized as a genuine refugee.
p328
aa(lp329
VThere is a historical precedent for it as well.
p330
aVBetween 1922 and 1942,
p331
aVthese Nansen passports were used as travel documents
p332
aVto allow 450,000 Assyrians, Turks and Chechens
p333
aVto travel across Europe
p334
aVand claim refugee status elsewhere in Europe.
p335
aVAnd the Nansen International Refugee Office
p336
aVreceived the Nobel Peace Prize
p337
aVin recognition of this being a viable strategy.
p338
aa(lp339
VSo all four of these ideas that I've presented you
p340
aVare ways in which we can expand Amira's choice set.
p341
aVThey're ways in which we can have greater choice for refugees
p342
aVbeyond those basic, impossible three options
p343
aVI explained to you
p344
aVand still leave others better off.
p345
aa(lp346
VIn conclusion, we really need a new vision,
p347
aVa vision that enlarges the choices of refugees
p348
aVbut recognizes that they don't have to be a burden.
p349
aVThere's nothing inevitable about refugees being a cost.
p350
aVYes, they are a humanitarian responsibility,
p351
aVbut they're human beings with skills, talents, aspirations,
p352
aVwith the ability to make contributions \u2014 if we let them.
p353
aa(lp354
VIn the new world,
p355
aVmigration is not going to go away.
p356
aVWhat we've seen in Europe will be with us for many years.
p357
aVPeople will continue to travel,
p358
aVthey'll continue to be displaced,
p359
aVand we need to find rational, realistic ways of managing this \u2014
p360
aVnot based on the old logics of humanitarian assistance,
p361
aVnot based on logics of charity,
p362
aVbut building on the opportunities
p363
aVoffered by globalization, markets and mobility.
p364
aVI'd urge you all to wake up and urge our politicians
p365
aVto wake up to this challenge.
p366
aa(lp367
VThank you very much.
