VTake a look at this picture.
p4
aVIt poses a very fascinating puzzle for us.
p5
aVThese African students are doing their homework
p6
aVunder streetlights at the airport in the capital city
p7
aVbecause they don't have any electricity at home.
p8
aVNow, I haven't met these particular students,
p9
aVbut I've met students like them.
p10
aa(lp11
VLet's just pick one \u2014 for example, the one in the green shirt.
p12
aVLet's give him a name, too: Nelson.
p13
aVI'll bet Nelson has a cellphone.
p14
aVSo here is the puzzle.
p15
aVWhy is it that Nelson has access
p16
aVto a cutting-edge technology, like the cellphone,
p17
aVbut doesn't have access to a 100-year-old technology
p18
aVfor generating electric light in the home?
p19
aa(lp20
VNow, in a word, the answer is "rules."
p21
aVBad rules can prevent the kind of win-win solution that's available
p22
aVwhen people can bring new technologies in
p23
aVand make them available to someone like Nelson.
p24
aVWhat kinds of rules?
p25
aVThe electric company in this nation
p26
aVoperates under a rule, which says that it has to sell
p27
aVelectricity at a very low, subsidized price \u2014
p28
aVin fact, a price that is so low it loses money on every unit that it sells.
p29
aVSo it has neither the resources, nor the incentives,
p30
aVto hook up many other users.
p31
aa(lp32
VThe president wanted to change this rule.
p33
aVHe's seen that it's possible to have a different set of rules,
p34
aVrules where businesses earn a small profit,
p35
aVso they have an incentive to sign up more customers.
p36
aVThat's the kind of rules that the cellphone company
p37
aVthat Nelson purchases his telephony from operates under.
p38
aVThe president has seen how those rules worked well.
p39
aVSo he tried to change the rules for pricing on electricity,
p40
aVbut ran into a firestorm of protest
p41
aVfrom businesses and consumers
p42
aVwho wanted to preserve the existing subsidized rates.
p43
aVSo he was stuck with rules that prevented him
p44
aVfrom letting the win-win solution help his country.
p45
aVAnd Nelson is stuck studying under the streetlights.
p46
aa(lp47
VThe real challenge then, is to try to figure out
p48
aVhow we can change rules.
p49
aVAre there some rules we can develop for changing rules?
p50
aVI want to argue that there is a general abstract insight
p51
aVthat we can make practical,
p52
aVwhich is that, if we can give more choices to people,
p53
aVand more choices to leaders \u2014
p54
aVwho, in many countries, are also people.
p55
aV(Laughter)
p56
aVBut, it's useful to present the opposition between these two.
p57
aVBecause the kind of choice you might want to give to a leader,
p58
aVa choice like giving the president the choice
p59
aVto raise prices on electricity,
p60
aVtakes away a choice that people in the economy want.
p61
aVThey want the choice to be able to continue consuming
p62
aVsubsidized electric power.
p63
aVSo if you give just to one side or the other,
p64
aVyou'll have tension or friction.
p65
aVBut if we can find ways to give more choices to both,
p66
aVthat will give us a set of rules
p67
aVfor changing rules that get us out of traps.
p68
aa(lp69
VNow, Nelson also has access to the Internet.
p70
aVAnd he says that if you want to see
p71
aVthe damaging effects of rules,
p72
aVthe ways that rules can keep people in the dark,
p73
aVlook at the pictures from NASA of the earth at night.
p74
aVIn particular check out Asia.
p75
aVIf you zoom in here,
p76
aVyou can see North Korea, in outline here,
p77
aVwhich is like a black hole compared to its neighbors.
p78
aVNow, you won't be surprised to learn
p79
aVthat the rules in North Korea
p80
aVkeep people there in the dark.
p81
aa(lp82
VBut it is important to recognize
p83
aVthat North Korea and South Korea
p84
aVstarted out with identical sets of rules
p85
aVin both the sense of laws and regulations,
p86
aVbut also in the deeper senses of understandings,
p87
aVnorms, culture, values and beliefs.
p88
aVWhen they separated, they made choices
p89
aVthat led to very divergent paths
p90
aVfor their sets of rules.
p91
aVSo we can change \u2014 we as humans can change the rules
p92
aVthat we use to interact with each other,
p93
aVfor better, or for worse.
p94
aa(lp95
VNow let's look at another region, the Caribbean.
p96
aVZoom in on Haiti,
p97
aVin outline here.
p98
aVHaiti is also dark,
p99
aVcompared to its neighbor here, the Dominican Republic,
p100
aVwhich has about the same number of residents.
p101
aVBoth of these countries are dark compared to Puerto Rico,
p102
aVwhich has half as many residents
p103
aVas either Haiti or the Dominican Republic.
p104
aVWhat Haiti warns us is that
p105
aVrules can be bad because governments are weak.
p106
aVIt's not just that the rules are bad because
p107
aVthe government is too strong and oppressive, as in North Korea.
p108
aVSo that if we want to create environments with good rules,
p109
aVwe can't just tear down.
p110
aVWe've got to find ways to build up, as well.
p111
aa(lp112
VNow, China dramatically demonstrates
p113
aVboth the potential and the challenges
p114
aVof working with rules.
p115
aVBack in the beginning of the data presented in this chart,
p116
aVChina was the world's high-technology leader.
p117
aVChinese had pioneered technologies like steel, printing, gunpowder.
p118
aVBut the Chinese never adopted, at least in that period,
p119
aVeffective rules for encouraging the spread of those ideas \u2014
p120
aVa profit motive that could have encouraged the spread.
p121
aVAnd they soon adopted rules which
p122
aVslowed down innovation
p123
aVand cut China off from the rest of the world.
p124
aVSo as other countries in the world innovated,
p125
aVin the sense both of developing
p126
aVnewer technologies,
p127
aVbut also developing newer rules,
p128
aVthe Chinese were cut off from those advances.
p129
aVIncome there stayed stagnant,
p130
aVas it zoomed ahead in the rest of the world.
p131
aa(lp132
VThis next chart looks at more recent data.
p133
aVIt plots income, average income in China
p134
aVas a percentage of average income in the United States.
p135
aVIn the '50s and '60s you can see that it was hovering at about three percent.
p136
aVBut then in the late '70s something changed.
p137
aVGrowth took off in China. The Chinese started catching up
p138
aVvery quickly with the United States.
p139
aa(lp140
VIf you go back to the map at night, you can get a clue
p141
aVto the process that lead to the dramatic change in rules in China.
p142
aVThe brightest spot in China,
p143
aVwhich you can see on the edge of the outline here,
p144
aVis Hong Kong.
p145
aVHong Kong was a small bit of China
p146
aVthat, for most of the 20th century,
p147
aVoperated under a very different set of rules
p148
aVthan the rest of mainland China \u2014
p149
aVrules that were copied
p150
aVfrom working market economies of the time,
p151
aVand administered by the British.
p152
aa(lp153
VIn the 1950s, Hong Kong was a place where
p154
aVmillions of people could go, from the mainland,
p155
aVto start in jobs like sewing shirts, making toys.
p156
aVBut, to get on a process of increasing income,
p157
aVincreasing skills
p158
aVled to very rapid growth there.
p159
aVHong Kong was also the model
p160
aVwhich leaders like Deng Xiaoping
p161
aVcould copy, when they decided to move
p162
aVall of the mainland towards the market model.
p163
aa(lp164
VBut Deng Xiaoping instinctively understood
p165
aVthe importance of offering choices to his people.
p166
aVSo instead of forcing everyone in China
p167
aVto shift immediately to the market model,
p168
aVthey proceeded by creating some special zones
p169
aVthat could do, in a sense, what Britain did:
p170
aVmake the opportunity to go work with the market rules
p171
aVavailable to the people who wanted to opt in there.
p172
aVSo they created four special economic zones around Hong Kong:
p173
aVzones where Chinese could come and work,
p174
aVand cities grew up very rapidly there;
p175
aValso zones where foreign firms could come in
p176
aVand make things.
p177
aa(lp178
VOne of the zones next to Hong Kong has a city called Shenzhen.
p179
aVIn that city there is a Taiwanese firm
p180
aVthat made the iPhone that many of you have,
p181
aVand they made it with labor from Chinese
p182
aVwho moved there to Shenzhen.
p183
aVSo after the four special zones,
p184
aVthere were 14 coastal cites
p185
aVthat were open in the same sense,
p186
aVand eventually demonstrated successes
p187
aVin these places that people could opt in to,
p188
aVthat they flocked to because of the advantages they offered.
p189
aVDemonstrated successes there led to a consensus for
p190
aVa move toward the market model for the entire economy.
p191
aa(lp192
VNow the Chinese example shows us several points.
p193
aVOne is: preserve choices for people.
p194
aVTwo: operate on the right scale.
p195
aVIf you try to change the rules in a village, you could do that,
p196
aVbut a village would be too small
p197
aVto get the kinds of benefits you can get if you have millions of people
p198
aVall working under good rules.
p199
aVOn the other hand, the nation is too big.
p200
aVIf you try to change the rules in the nation,
p201
aVyou can't give some people a chance
p202
aVto hold back, see how things turn out,
p203
aVand let others zoom ahead and try the new rules.
p204
aVBut cities give you this opportunity
p205
aVto create new places,
p206
aVwith new rules that people can opt in to.
p207
aVAnd they're large enough
p208
aVto get all of the benefits that we can have
p209
aVwhen millions of us work together under good rules.
p210
aa(lp211
VSo the proposal is that we
p212
aVconceive of something called a charter city.
p213
aVWe start with a charter that specifies
p214
aVall the rules required
p215
aVto attract the people who we'll need to build the city.
p216
aVWe'll need to attract the investors
p217
aVwho will build out the infrastructure \u2014
p218
aVthe power system, the roads, the port, the airport, the buildings.
p219
aVYou'll need to attract firms,
p220
aVwho will come hire the people who move there first.
p221
aVAnd you'll need to attract families,
p222
aVthe residents who will come and live there permanently,
p223
aVraise their children, get an education for their children,
p224
aVand get their first job.
p225
aa(lp226
VWith that charter, people will move there.
p227
aVThe city can be built.
p228
aVAnd we can scale this model.
p229
aVWe can go do it over and over again.
p230
aVTo make it work, we need good rules. We've already discussed that.
p231
aVThose are captured in the charter.
p232
aVWe also need the choices for people.
p233
aVThat's really built into the model
p234
aVif we allow for the possibility of building cities
p235
aVon uninhabited land.
p236
aVYou start from uninhabited territory.
p237
aVPeople can come live under the new charter,
p238
aVbut no one is forced to live under it.
p239
aVThe final thing we need are choices for leaders.
p240
aa(lp241
VAnd, to achieve the kind of choices we want for leaders
p242
aVwe need to allow for the potential for partnerships between nations:
p243
aVcases where nations work together,
p244
aVin effect, de facto,
p245
aVthe way China and Britain worked together
p246
aVto build, first a little enclave of the market model,
p247
aVand then scale it throughout China.
p248
aVIn a sense, Britain, inadvertently,
p249
aVthrough its actions in Hong Kong,
p250
aVdid more to reduce world poverty
p251
aVthan all the aid programs that we've undertaken
p252
aVin the last century.
p253
aVSo if we allow for these kind of partnerships
p254
aVto replicate this again,
p255
aVwe can get those kinds of benefits scaled throughout the world.
p256
aa(lp257
VIn some cases this will involve a delegation of responsibility,
p258
aVa delegation of control from one country to another
p259
aVto take over certain kinds of administrative responsibilities.
p260
aVNow, when I say that,
p261
aVsome of you are starting to think,
p262
aV"Well, is this just bringing back colonialism?"
p263
aVIt's not. But it's important to recognize that the kind of emotions
p264
aVthat come up when we start to think about these things,
p265
aVcan get in the way, can make us pull back,
p266
aVcan shut down our ability,
p267
aVand our interest in trying to explore new ideas.
p268
aa(lp269
VWhy is this not like colonialism?
p270
aVThe thing that was bad about colonialism,
p271
aVand the thing which is residually bad in some of our aid programs,
p272
aVis that it involved elements of
p273
aVcoercion and condescension.
p274
aVThis model is all about choices,
p275
aVboth for leaders and for the people who will live in these new places.
p276
aVAnd, choice is the antidote to coercion and condescension.
p277
aa(lp278
VSo let's talk about how this could play out in practice.
p279
aVLet's take a particular leader, Raul Castro, who is the leader of Cuba.
p280
aVIt must have occurred to Castro
p281
aVthat he has the chance to do for Cuba
p282
aVwhat Deng Xiaoping did for China,
p283
aVbut he doesn't have a Hong Kong there on the island in Cuba.
p284
aVHe does, though, have a little bit of light down in the south
p285
aVthat has a very special status.
p286
aVThere is a zone there, around Guantanamo Bay,
p287
aVwhere a treaty gives the United States
p288
aVadministrative responsibility
p289
aVfor a piece of land that's about twice the size of Manhattan.
p290
aa(lp291
VCastro goes to the prime minister of Canada
p292
aVand says, "Look, the Yankees have a terrible PR problem.
p293
aVThey want to get out.
p294
aVWhy don't you, Canada, take over?
p295
aVBuild \u2014 run a special administrative zone.
p296
aVAllow a new city to be built up there.
p297
aVAllow many people to come in.
p298
aVLet us have a Hong Kong nearby.
p299
aVSome of my citizens will move into that city as well.
p300
aVOthers will hold back. But this will be
p301
aVthe gateway that will connect
p302
aVthe modern economy and the modern world
p303
aVto my country."
p304
aa(lp305
VNow, where else might this model be tried?
p306
aVWell, Africa. I've talked with leaders in Africa.
p307
aVMany of them totally get the notion of a special zone
p308
aVthat people can opt into as a rule.
p309
aVIt's a rule for changing rules.
p310
aVIt's a way to create new rules, and let people opt-in
p311
aVwithout coercion, and the opposition that coercion can force.
p312
aVThey also totally get the idea that in some instances
p313
aVthey can make more credible promises to long-term investors \u2014
p314
aVthe kind of investors who will come build the port,
p315
aVbuild the roads, in a new city \u2014
p316
aa(lp317
Vthey can make more credible promises
p318
aVif they do it along with a partner nation.
p319
aVPerhaps even in some arrangement
p320
aVthat's a little bit like an escrow account,
p321
aVwhere you put land in the escrow account
p322
aVand the partner nation takes responsibility for it.
p323
aVThere is also lots of land in Africa
p324
aVwhere new cities could be built.
p325
aVThis is a picture I took when I was flying along the coast.
p326
aVThere are immense stretches of land like this \u2014
p327
aVland where hundreds of millions of people could live.
p328
aVNow, if we generalize this and think about
p329
aVnot just one or two charter cites, but dozens \u2014
p330
aVcities that will help create places for the
p331
aVmany hundreds of millions, perhaps billions of people
p332
aVwho will move to cities in the coming century \u2014
p333
aa(lp334
Vis there enough land for them?
p335
aVWell, throughout the world, if we look at the lights at night,
p336
aVthe one thing that's misleading is that, visually, it looks
p337
aVlike most of the world is already built out.
p338
aVSo let me show you why that's wrong.
p339
aVTake this representation of all of the land.
p340
aVTurn it into a square that stands for
p341
aVall the arable land on Earth.
p342
aVAnd let these dots represent the land that's already taken up
p343
aVby the cities that three billion people now live in.
p344
aVIf you move the dots down to the bottom of the rectangle
p345
aVyou can see that the cities for the existing three billion urban residents
p346
aVtake up only three percent of the arable land on earth.
p347
aa(lp348
VSo if we wanted to build cities for another billion people,
p349
aVthey would be dots like this.
p350
aVWe'd go from three percent of the arable land, to four percent.
p351
aVWe'd dramatically reduce the human footprint on Earth
p352
aVby building more cities that people can move to.
p353
aVAnd if these are cities governed by good rules,
p354
aVthey can be cities where people are safe from crime,
p355
aVsafe from disease and bad sanitation,
p356
aVwhere people have a chance to get a job.
p357
aVThey can get basic utilities like electricity.
p358
aVTheir kids can get an education.
p359
aa(lp360
VSo what will it take to get started
p361
aVbuilding the first charter cities,
p362
aVscaling this so we build many more?
p363
aVIt would help to have a manual.
p364
aV(Laughter)
p365
aVWhat university professors could do
p366
aVis write some details that might go into this manual.
p367
aVYou wouldn't want to let us run the cities,
p368
aVgo out and design them.
p369
aVYou wouldn't let academics out in the wild. (Laughter)
p370
aa(lp371
VBut, you could set us to work thinking about questions like,
p372
aVsuppose it isn't just Canada
p373
aVthat does the deal with Raul Castro.
p374
aVPerhaps Brazil comes in as a participant,
p375
aVand Spain as well. And perhaps Cuba wants to be
p376
aVone of the partners in a four-way joint venture.
p377
aVHow would we write the treaty to do that?
p378
aVThere is less precedent for that, but that could easily be worked out.
p379
aa(lp380
VHow would we finance this?
p381
aVTurns out Singapore and Hong Kong
p382
aVare cities that made huge gains
p383
aVon the value of the land that they owned when they got started.
p384
aVYou could use the gains on the value of the land
p385
aVto pay for things like the police, the courts,
p386
aVbut the school system and the health care system too,
p387
aVwhich make this a more attractive place to live,
p388
aVmakes this a place where people have higher incomes \u2014
p389
aVwhich, incidentally, makes the land more valuable.
p390
aVSo the incentives for the people helping to construct this zone
p391
aVand build it, and set up the basic rules,
p392
aVgo very much in the right direction.
p393
aa(lp394
VSo there are many other details like this.
p395
aVHow could we have buildings that are
p396
aVlow cost and affordable for people who work
p397
aVin a first job, assembling something like an iPhone,
p398
aVbut make those buildings energy efficient,
p399
aVand make sure that they are safe, so they don't fall down
p400
aVin an earthquake or a hurricane.
p401
aVMany technical details to be worked out,
p402
aVbut those of us who are already starting to pursue these things
p403
aVcan already tell that there is no roadblock,
p404
aVthere's no impediment, other than a failure of imagination,
p405
aVthat will keep us from delivering on
p406
aVa truly global win-win solution.
p407
aa(lp408
VLet me conclude with this picture.
p409
aVThe reason we can be so well off,
p410
aVeven though there is so many people on earth,
p411
aVis because of the power of ideas.
p412
aVWe can share ideas with other people,
p413
aVand when they discover them, they share with us.
p414
aVIt's not like scarce objects,
p415
aVwhere sharing means we each get less.
p416
aVWhen we share ideas we all get more.
p417
aVWhen we think about ideas in that way,
p418
aVwe usually think about technologies.
p419
aa(lp420
VBut there is another class of ideas:
p421
aVthe rules that govern how we interact with each other;
p422
aVrules like, let's have a tax system
p423
aVthat supports a research university
p424
aVthat gives away certain kinds of knowledge for free.
p425
aVLet's have a system where we have ownership of land
p426
aVthat is registered in a government office,
p427
aVthat people can pledge as collateral.
p428
aa(lp429
VIf we can keep innovating on our space of rules,
p430
aVand particularly innovate in the sense
p431
aVof coming up with rules for changing rules,
p432
aVso we don't get stuck with bad rules,
p433
aVthen we can keep moving progress forward
p434
aVand truly make the world a better place,
p435
aVso that people like Nelson and his friends
p436
aVdon't have to study any longer under the streetlights. Thank you.
