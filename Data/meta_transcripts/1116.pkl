VCan any of you
p4
aVremember what you wanted to be
p5
aVwhen you were 17?
p6
aVDo you know what I wanted to be?
p7
aVI wanted to be a biker chick.
p8
aV(Laughter)
p9
aVI wanted to race cars,
p10
aVand I wanted to be a cowgirl,
p11
aVand I wanted to be Mowgli from "The Jungle Book."
p12
aVBecause they were all about being free,
p13
aVthe wind in your hair \u2014 just to be free.
p14
aVAnd on my seventeenth birthday,
p15
aVmy parents, knowing how much I loved speed,
p16
aVgave me one driving lesson
p17
aVfor my seventeenth birthday.
p18
aVNot that we could have afforded I drive,
p19
aVbut to give me the dream of driving.
p20
aa(lp21
VAnd on my seventeenth birthday,
p22
aVI accompanied my little sister
p23
aVin complete innocence,
p24
aVas I always had all my life \u2014
p25
aVmy visually impaired sister \u2014
p26
aVto go to see an eye specialist.
p27
aVBecause big sisters
p28
aVare always supposed to support their little sisters.
p29
aVAnd my little sister wanted to be a pilot \u2014
p30
aVGod help her.
p31
aVSo I used to get my eyes tested
p32
aVjust for fun.
p33
aVAnd on my seventeenth birthday,
p34
aVafter my fake eye exam,
p35
aVthe eye specialist just noticed it happened to be my birthday.
p36
aVAnd he said, "So what are you going to do to celebrate?"
p37
aVAnd I took that driving lesson,
p38
aVand I said, "I'm going to learn how to drive."
p39
aVAnd then there was a silence \u2014
p40
aVone of those awful silences
p41
aVwhen you know something's wrong.
p42
aVAnd he turned to my mother,
p43
aVand he said, "You haven't told her yet?"
p44
aVOn my seventeenth birthday,
p45
aVas Janis Ian would best say,
p46
aVI learned the truth at 17.
p47
aVI am, and have been since birth,
p48
aVlegally blind.
p49
aa(lp50
VAnd you know,
p51
aVhow on earth did I get to 17
p52
aVand not know that?
p53
aVWell, if anybody says country music isn't powerful,
p54
aVlet me tell you this:
p55
aVI got there
p56
aVbecause my father's passion for Johnny Cash
p57
aVand a song, "A Boy Named Sue."
p58
aVI'm the eldest of three. I was born in 1971.
p59
aVAnd very shortly after my birth,
p60
aVmy parents found out I had a condition called ocular albinism.
p61
aVAnd what the hell does that mean to you?
p62
aVSo let me just tell you, the great part of all of this?
p63
aVI can't see this clock and I can't see the timing,
p64
aVso holy God, woohoo! (Laughter)
p65
aVI might buy some more time.
p66
aVBut more importantly, let me tell you \u2014
p67
aVI'm going to come up really close here. Don't freak out, Pat.
p68
aVHey.
p69
aVSee this hand?
p70
aVBeyond this hand is a world of Vaseline.
p71
aVEvery man in this room, even you, Steve,
p72
aVis George Clooney.
p73
aV(Laughter)
p74
aVAnd every woman, you are so beautiful.
p75
aVAnd when I want to look beautiful, I step three feet away from the mirror,
p76
aVand I don't have to see these lines etched in my face
p77
aVfrom all the squinting I've done all my life
p78
aVfrom all the dark lights.
p79
aa(lp80
VThe really strange part is
p81
aVthat, at three and a half, just before I was going to school,
p82
aVmy parents made a bizarre, unusual
p83
aVand incredibly brave decision.
p84
aVNo special needs schools.
p85
aVNo labels.
p86
aVNo limitations.
p87
aVMy ability and my potential.
p88
aVAnd they decided to tell me
p89
aVthat I could see.
p90
aVSo just like Johnny Cash's Sue,
p91
aVa boy given a girl's name,
p92
aVI would grow up and learn from experience
p93
aVhow to be tough and how to survive,
p94
aVwhen they were no longer there to protect me,
p95
aVor just take it all away.
p96
aVBut more significantly,
p97
aVthey gave me the ability
p98
aVto believe,
p99
aVtotally, to believe that I could.
p100
aVAnd so when I heard that eye specialist
p101
aVtell me all the things, a big fat "no,"
p102
aVeverybody imagines I was devastated.
p103
aVAnd don't get me wrong, because when I first heard it \u2014
p104
aVaside from the fact that I thought he was insane \u2014
p105
aVI got that thump in my chest,
p106
aVjust that "huh?"
p107
aVBut very quickly I recovered. It was like that.
p108
aVThe first thing I thought about was my mom,
p109
aVwho was crying over beside me.
p110
aVAnd I swear to God, I walked out of his office,
p111
aV"I will drive. I will drive.
p112
aVYou're mad. I'll drive. I know I can drive."
p113
aa(lp114
VAnd with the same dogged determination
p115
aVthat my father had bred into me since I was such a child \u2014
p116
aVhe taught me how to sail,
p117
aVknowing I could never see where I was going, I could never see the shore,
p118
aVand I couldn't see the sails, and I couldn't see the destination.
p119
aVBut he told me to believe
p120
aVand feel the wind in my face.
p121
aVAnd that wind in my face made me believe
p122
aVthat he was mad and I would drive.
p123
aVAnd for the next 11 years,
p124
aVI swore nobody would ever find out that I couldn't see,
p125
aVbecause I didn't want to be a failure,
p126
aVand I didn't want to be weak.
p127
aVAnd I believed I could do it.
p128
aVSo I rammed through life as only a Casey can do.
p129
aVAnd I was an archeologist, and then I broke things.
p130
aVAnd then I managed a restaurant, and then I slipped on things.
p131
aVAnd then I was a masseuse. And then I was a landscape gardener.
p132
aVAnd then I went to business school.
p133
aVAnd you know, disabled people are hugely educated.
p134
aVAnd then I went in and I got a global consulting job with Accenture.
p135
aVAnd they didn't even know.
p136
aVAnd it's extraordinary
p137
aVhow far belief can take you.
p138
aa(lp139
VIn 1999,
p140
aVtwo and a half years into that job,
p141
aVsomething happened.
p142
aVWonderfully, my eyes decided, enough.
p143
aVAnd temporarily,
p144
aVvery unexpectedly,
p145
aVthey dropped.
p146
aVAnd I'm in one of the most competitive environments in the world,
p147
aVwhere you work hard, play hard, you gotta be the best, you gotta be the best.
p148
aVAnd two years in,
p149
aVI really could see very little.
p150
aVAnd I found myself in front of an HR manager
p151
aVin 1999,
p152
aVsaying something I never imagined that I would say.
p153
aVI was 28 years old.
p154
aVI had built a persona all around what I could and couldn't do.
p155
aVAnd I simply said,
p156
aV"I'm sorry.
p157
aVI can't see, and I need help."
p158
aVAsking for help can be incredibly difficult.
p159
aVAnd you all know what it is. You don't need to have a disability to know that.
p160
aVWe all know how hard it is
p161
aVto admit weakness and failure.
p162
aVAnd it's frightening, isn't it?
p163
aVBut all that belief had fueled me so long.
p164
aa(lp165
VAnd can I tell you, operating in the sighted world when you can't see,
p166
aVit's kind of difficult \u2014 it really is.
p167
aVCan I tell you, airports are a disaster.
p168
aVOh, for the love of God.
p169
aVAnd please, any designers out there?
p170
aVOK, designers, please put up your hands, even though I can't even see you.
p171
aVI always end up in the gents' toilets.
p172
aVAnd there's nothing wrong with my sense of smell.
p173
aVBut can I just tell you,
p174
aVthe little sign for a gents' toilet or a ladies' toilet
p175
aVis determined by a triangle.
p176
aVHave you ever tried to see that
p177
aVif you have Vaseline in front of your eyes?
p178
aVIt's such a small thing, right?
p179
aVAnd you know how exhausting it can be
p180
aVto try to be perfect when you're not,
p181
aVor to be somebody that you aren't?
p182
aa(lp183
VAnd so after admitting I couldn't see to HR,
p184
aVthey sent me off to an eye specialist.
p185
aVAnd I had no idea that this man was going to change my life.
p186
aVBut before I got to him, I was so lost.
p187
aVI had no idea who I was anymore.
p188
aVAnd that eye specialist, he didn't bother testing my eyes.
p189
aVGod no, it was therapy.
p190
aVAnd he asked me several questions,
p191
aVof which many were, "Why?
p192
aVWhy are you fighting so hard
p193
aVnot to be yourself?
p194
aVAnd do you love what you do, Caroline?"
p195
aVAnd you know, when you go to a global consulting firm,
p196
aVthey put a chip in your head, and you're like,
p197
aV"I love Accenture. I love Accenture. I love my job. I love Accenture.
p198
aVI love Accenture. I love Accenture. I love my job. I love Accenture." (Laughter)
p199
aVTo leave would be failure.
p200
aVAnd he said, "Do you love it?"
p201
aVI couldn't even speak I was so choked up.
p202
aVI just was so \u2014 how do I tell him?
p203
aVAnd then he said to me, "What did you want to be when you were little?"
p204
aVNow listen, I wasn't going to say to him, "Well, I wanted to race cars and motorbikes."
p205
aVHardly appropriate at this moment in time.
p206
aVHe thought I was mad enough anyway.
p207
aVAnd as I left his office,
p208
aVhe called me back
p209
aVand he said, "I think it's time.
p210
aVI think it's time
p211
aVto stop fighting and do something different."
p212
aVAnd that door closed.
p213
aVAnd that silence just outside a doctor's office,
p214
aVthat many of us know.
p215
aVAnd my chest ached.
p216
aVAnd I had no idea where I was going. I had no idea.
p217
aVBut I did know the game was up.
p218
aa(lp219
VAnd I went home, and, because the pain in my chest ached so much,
p220
aVI thought, "I'll go out for a run."
p221
aVReally not a very sensible thing to do.
p222
aVAnd I went on a run that I know so well.
p223
aVI know this run so well, by the back of my hand.
p224
aVI always run it perfectly fine.
p225
aVI count the steps and the lampposts and all those things
p226
aVthat visually impaired people have a tendency to have a lot of meetings with.
p227
aVAnd there was a rock that I always missed.
p228
aVAnd I'd never fallen on it, never.
p229
aVAnd there I was crying away,
p230
aVand smash, bash on my rock.
p231
aVBroken, fallen over
p232
aVon this rock
p233
aVin the middle of March in 2000,
p234
aVtypical Irish weather on a Wednesday \u2014
p235
aVgray, snot, tears everywhere,
p236
aVridiculously self-pitying.
p237
aa(lp238
VAnd I was floored, and I was broken,
p239
aVand I was angry.
p240
aVAnd I didn't know what to do.
p241
aVAnd I sat there for quite some time going,
p242
aV"How am I going to get off this rock and go home?
p243
aVBecause who am I going to be?
p244
aVWhat am I going to be?"
p245
aVAnd I thought about my dad,
p246
aVand I thought, "Good God, I'm so not Sue now."
p247
aVAnd I kept thinking over and over in my mind,
p248
aVwhat had happened? Where did it go wrong? Why didn't I understand?
p249
aVAnd you know, the extraordinary part of it
p250
aVis I just simply had no answers.
p251
aVI had lost my belief.
p252
aVLook where my belief had brought me to.
p253
aVAnd now I had lost it. And now I really couldn't see.
p254
aVI was crumpled.
p255
aVAnd then I remember thinking about that eye specialist
p256
aVasking me, "What do you want to be? What do you want to be?
p257
aVWhat did you want to be when you were little? Do you love what you do?
p258
aVDo something different. What do you want to be?
p259
aVDo something different. What do you want to be?"
p260
aVAnd really slowly, slowly, slowly,
p261
aVit happened.
p262
aVAnd it did happen this way.
p263
aVAnd then the minute it came,
p264
aVit blew up in my head
p265
aVand bashed in my heart \u2014
p266
aVsomething different.
p267
aV"Well, how about Mowgli from 'The Jungle Book'?
p268
aVYou don't get more different than that."
p269
aVAnd the moment, and I mean the moment,
p270
aVthe moment that hit me,
p271
aVI swear to God,
p272
aVit was like woo hoo! You know \u2014 something to believe in.
p273
aVAnd nobody can tell me no.
p274
aVYes, you can say I can't be an archeologist.
p275
aVBut you can't tell me, no, I can't be Mowgli, because guess what?
p276
aVNobody's ever done it before, so I'm going to go do it.
p277
aVAnd it doesn't matter whether I'm a boy or a girl, I'm just going to scoot.
p278
aa(lp279
VAnd so I got off that rock, and, oh my God, did I run home.
p280
aVAnd I sprinted home, and I didn't fall, and I didn't crash.
p281
aVAnd I ran up the stairs, and there was one of my favorite books of all time,
p282
aV"Travels on My Elephant" by Mark Shand \u2014 I don't know if any of you know it.
p283
aVAnd I grabbed this book off, and I'm sitting on the couch
p284
aVgoing, "I know what I'm going to do.
p285
aVI know how to be Mowgli.
p286
aVI'm going to go across India
p287
aVon the back of an elephant.
p288
aVI'm going to be an elephant handler."
p289
aVAnd I had no idea
p290
aVhow I was going to be an elephant handler.
p291
aVFrom global management consultant to elephant handler.
p292
aVI had no idea how. I had no idea how you hire an elephant, get an elephant.
p293
aVI didn't speak Hindi. I'd never been to India. Hadn't a clue.
p294
aVBut I knew I would.
p295
aVBecause, when you make a decision at the right time and the right place,
p296
aVGod, that universe makes it happen for you.
p297
aa(lp298
VNine months later, after that day on snot rock,
p299
aVI had the only blind date in my life
p300
aVwith a seven and a half foot elephant called Kanchi.
p301
aVAnd together we would trek a thousand kilometers
p302
aVacross India.
p303
aV(Applause)
p304
aVThe most powerful thing of all,
p305
aVit's not that I didn't achieve before then. Oh my God, I did.
p306
aVBut you know, I was believing in the wrong thing.
p307
aVBecause I wasn't believing in me,
p308
aVreally me, all the bits of me \u2014
p309
aVall the bits of all of us.
p310
aVDo you know how much of us all pretend to be somebody we're not?
p311
aVAnd you know what, when you really believe in yourself and everything about you,
p312
aVit's extraordinary what happens.
p313
aa(lp314
VAnd you know what, that trip, that thousand kilometers,
p315
aVit raised enough money for 6,000 cataract eye operations.
p316
aVSix thousand people got to see because of that.
p317
aVWhen I came home off that elephant,
p318
aVdo you know what the most amazing part was?
p319
aVI chucked in my job at Accenture.
p320
aVI left, and I became a social entrepreneur,
p321
aVand I set up an organization with Mark Shand called Elephant Family,
p322
aVwhich deals with Asian elephant conservation.
p323
aVAnd I set up Kanchi,
p324
aVbecause my organization was always going to be named after my elephant,
p325
aVbecause disability is like the elephant in the room.
p326
aVAnd I wanted to make you see it in a positive way \u2014
p327
aVno charity, no pity.
p328
aVBut I wanted to work only and truly
p329
aVwith business and media leadership
p330
aVto totally reframe disability
p331
aVin a way that was exciting and possible.
p332
aVIt was extraordinary.
p333
aVThat's what I wanted to do.
p334
aVAnd I never thought about noes anymore, or not seeing,
p335
aVor any of that kind of nothing.
p336
aVIt just seemed that it was possible.
p337
aa(lp338
VAnd you know, the oddest part is,
p339
aVwhen I was on my way traveling here to TED,
p340
aVI'll be honest, I was petrified.
p341
aVAnd I speak,
p342
aVbut this is an amazing audience,
p343
aVand what am I doing here?
p344
aVBut as I was traveling here,
p345
aVyou'll be very happy to know,
p346
aVI did use my white symbol stick cane,
p347
aVbecause it's really good to skip queues in the airport.
p348
aVAnd I got my way here
p349
aVbeing happily proud that I couldn't see.
p350
aVAnd the one thing is that a really good friend of mine,
p351
aVhe texted me on the way over, knowing I was scared.
p352
aVEven though I present confident, I was scared.
p353
aVHe said, "Be you."
p354
aVAnd so here I am.
p355
aVThis is me, all of me.
p356
aa(lp357
V(Applause)
p358
aa(lp359
VAnd I have learned, you know what,
p360
aVcars and motorbikes and elephants,
p361
aVthat's not freedom.
p362
aVBeing absolutely true to yourself is freedom.
p363
aVAnd I never needed eyes to see \u2014 never.
p364
aVI simply needed vision and belief.
p365
aVAnd if you truly believe \u2014
p366
aVand I mean believe from the bottom of your heart \u2014
p367
aVyou can make change happen.
p368
aVAnd we need to make it happen,
p369
aVbecause every single one of us \u2014
p370
aVwoman, man, gay, straight,
p371
aVdisabled, perfect,
p372
aVnormal, whatever \u2014
p373
aVeveryone of us
p374
aVmust be the very best of ourselves.
p375
aVI no longer want anybody to be invisible.
p376
aVWe all have to be included.
p377
aVAnd stop with the labels, the limiting.
p378
aVLosing of labels,
p379
aVbecause we are not jam jars.
p380
aVWe are extraordinary, different, wonderful people.
p381
