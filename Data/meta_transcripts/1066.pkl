VI'm going to make an argument today
p4
aVthat may seem a little bit crazy:
p5
aVsocial media and the end of gender.
p6
aVLet me connect the dots.
p7
aVI'm going to argue today
p8
aVthat the social media applications
p9
aVthat we all know and love, or love to hate,
p10
aVare actually going to help free us
p11
aVfrom some of the absurd assumptions
p12
aVthat we have as a society about gender.
p13
aVI think that social media
p14
aVis actually going to help us dismantle
p15
aVsome of the silly and demeaning stereotypes
p16
aVthat we see in media and advertising
p17
aVabout gender.
p18
aa(lp19
VIf you hadn't noticed,
p20
aVour media climate generally provides
p21
aVa very distorted mirror
p22
aVof our lives and of our gender,
p23
aVand I think that's going to change.
p24
aVNow most media companies \u2014
p25
aVtelevision, radio, publishing, games, you name it \u2014
p26
aVthey use very rigid segmentation methods
p27
aVin order to understand their audiences.
p28
aVIt's old-school demographics.
p29
aVThey come up with these very restrictive labels to define us.
p30
aVNow the crazy thing
p31
aVis that media companies believe
p32
aVthat if you fall within a certain demographic category
p33
aVthen you are predictable in certain ways \u2014
p34
aVyou have certain taste,
p35
aVthat you like certain things.
p36
aVAnd so the bizarre result of this
p37
aVis that most of our popular culture
p38
aVis actually based on these presumptions
p39
aVabout our demographics.
p40
aa(lp41
VAge demographics:
p42
aVthe 18 to 49 demo
p43
aVhas had a huge impact
p44
aVon all mass media programming in this country
p45
aVsince the 1960s,
p46
aVwhen the baby boomers were still young.
p47
aVNow they've aged out of that demographic,
p48
aVbut it's still the case
p49
aVthat powerful ratings companies like Nielson
p50
aVdon't even take into account
p51
aVviewers of television shows over age 54.
p52
aVIn our media environment,
p53
aVit's as if they don't even exist.
p54
aVNow, if you watch "Mad Men," like I do \u2014
p55
aVit's a popular TV show in the States \u2014
p56
aVDr. Faye Miller does something called psychographics,
p57
aVwhich first came about in the 1960s,
p58
aVwhere you create these complex psychological profiles
p59
aVof consumers.
p60
aVBut psychographics really haven't had a huge impact on the media business.
p61
aVIt's really just been basic demographics.
p62
aa(lp63
VSo I'm at the Norman Lear Center at USC,
p64
aVand we've done a lot of research over the last seven, eight years
p65
aVon demographics
p66
aVand how they affect media and entertainment
p67
aVin this country and abroad.
p68
aVAnd in the last three years,
p69
aVwe've been looking specifically at social media to see what has changed,
p70
aVand we've discovered some very interesting things.
p71
aVAll the people who participate in social media networks
p72
aVbelong to the same old demographic categories
p73
aVthat media companies and advertisers
p74
aVhave used in order to understand them.
p75
aVBut those categories mean even less now
p76
aVthan they did before,
p77
aVbecause with online networking tools,
p78
aVit's much easier for us
p79
aVto escape some of our demographic boxes.
p80
aVWe're able to connect with people quite freely
p81
aVand to redefine ourselves online.
p82
aVAnd we can lie about our age online, too, pretty easily.
p83
aVWe can also connect with people
p84
aVbased on our very specific interests.
p85
aVWe don't need a media company
p86
aVto help do this for us.
p87
aa(lp88
VSo the traditional media companies, of course,
p89
aVare paying very close attention to these online communities.
p90
aVThey know this is the mass audience of the future;
p91
aVthey need to figure it out.
p92
aVBut they're having a hard time doing it
p93
aVbecause they're still trying to use demographics in order to understand them,
p94
aVbecause that's how ad rates are still determined.
p95
aVWhen they're monitoring your clickstream \u2014
p96
aVand you know they are \u2014
p97
aVthey have a really hard time
p98
aVfiguring out your age, your gender and your income.
p99
aVThey can make some educated guesses.
p100
aVBut they get a lot more information
p101
aVabout what you do online,
p102
aVwhat you like, what interests you.
p103
aVThat's easier for them to find out than who you are.
p104
aVAnd even though that's still sort of creepy,
p105
aVthere is an upside
p106
aVto having your taste monitored.
p107
aVSuddenly our taste is being respected
p108
aVin a way that it hasn't been before.
p109
aVIt had been presumed before.
p110
aa(lp111
VSo when you look online at the way people aggregate,
p112
aVthey don't aggregate
p113
aVaround age, gender and income.
p114
aVThey aggregate around the things they love,
p115
aVthe things that they like,
p116
aVand if you think about it, shared interests and values
p117
aVare a far more powerful aggregator of human beings
p118
aVthan demographic categories.
p119
aVI'd much rather know
p120
aVwhether you like "Buffy the Vampire Slayer"
p121
aVrather than how old you are.
p122
aVThat would tell me something more substantial about you.
p123
aa(lp124
VNow there's something else that we've discovered about social media
p125
aVthat's actually quite surprising.
p126
aVIt turns out that women
p127
aVare really driving the social media revolution.
p128
aVIf you look at the statistics \u2014
p129
aVthese are worldwide statistics \u2014
p130
aVin every single age category,
p131
aVwomen actually outnumber men
p132
aVin their use of social networking technologies.
p133
aVAnd then if you look at the amount of time
p134
aVthat they spend on these sites,
p135
aVthey truly dominate the social media space,
p136
aVwhich is a space that's having a huge impact
p137
aVon old media.
p138
aVThe question is: what sort of impact
p139
aVis this going to have on our culture,
p140
aVand what's it going to mean for women?
p141
aVIf the case is that social media
p142
aVis dominating old media
p143
aVand women are dominating social media,
p144
aVthen does that mean that women
p145
aVare going to take over global media?
p146
aVAre we suddenly going to see
p147
aVa lot more female characters in cartoons
p148
aVand in games and on TV shows?
p149
aVWill the next big-budget blockbuster movies
p150
aVactually be chick flicks?
p151
aVCould this be possible,
p152
aVthat suddenly our media landscape
p153
aVwill become a feminist landscape?
p154
aa(lp155
VWell, I actually don't think that's going to be the case.
p156
aVI think that media companies are going to hire a lot more women,
p157
aVbecause they realize this is important for their business,
p158
aVand I think that women
p159
aVare also going to continue to dominate
p160
aVthe social media sphere.
p161
aVBut I think women are actually going to be \u2014 ironically enough \u2014
p162
aVresponsible for driving a stake through the heart
p163
aVof cheesy genre categories
p164
aVlike the "chick flick"
p165
aVand all these other genre categories
p166
aVthat presume that certain demographic groups
p167
aVlike certain things \u2014
p168
aVthat Hispanics like certain things,
p169
aVthat young people like certain things.
p170
aVThis is far too simplistic.
p171
aVThe future entertainment media that we're going to see
p172
aVis going to be very data-driven,
p173
aVand it's going to be based on the information
p174
aVthat we ascertain from taste communities online,
p175
aVwhere women are really driving the action.
p176
aa(lp177
VSo you may be asking, well why is it important
p178
aVthat I know what entertains people?
p179
aVWhy should I know this?
p180
aVOf course, old media companies and advertisers
p181
aVneed to know this.
p182
aVBut my argument is that,
p183
aVif you want to understand the global village,
p184
aVit's probably a good idea that you figure out
p185
aVwhat they're passionate about, what amuses them,
p186
aVwhat they choose to do in their free time.
p187
aVThis is a very important thing to know about people.
p188
aVI've spent most of my professional life
p189
aVresearching media and entertainment
p190
aVand its impact on people's lives.
p191
aVAnd I do it not just because it's fun \u2014
p192
aVthough actually, it is really fun \u2014
p193
aVbut also because
p194
aVour research has shown over and over again
p195
aVthat entertainment and play
p196
aVhave a huge impact on people's lives \u2014
p197
aVfor instance, on their political beliefs
p198
aVand on their health.
p199
aVAnd so, if you have any interest in understanding the world,
p200
aVlooking at how people amuse themselves
p201
aVis a really good way to start.
p202
aa(lp203
VSo imagine a media atmosphere
p204
aVthat isn't dominated by lame stereotypes
p205
aVabout gender
p206
aVand other demographic characteristics.
p207
aVCan you even imagine what that looks like?
p208
aVI can't wait to find out what it looks like.
p209
aa(lp210
