VI want to talk to you about something
p4
aVkind of big.
p5
aVWe'll start here.
p6
aVSixty-five million years ago \u2014
p7
aa(lp8
V(Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
Vthe dinosaurs had a bad day.
p11
aa(lp12
V(Laughter)
p13
aa(lp14
VA chunk of rock six miles across,
p15
aVmoving something like 50 times the speed of a rifle bullet,
p16
aVslammed into the Earth.
p17
aVIt released its energy all at once,
p18
aVand it was an explosion that was mind-numbing.
p19
aVIf you took every nuclear weapon ever built
p20
aVat the height of the Cold War,
p21
aVlumped them together,
p22
aVand blew them up at the same time,
p23
aVthat would be one one-millionth of the energy released at that moment.
p24
aVThe dinosaurs had a really bad day.
p25
aVOK?
p26
aa(lp27
VNow, a six-mile-wide rock is very large.
p28
aVWe all live here in Boulder.
p29
aVIf you look out your window and see Longs Peak \u2014
p30
aVyou're probably familiar with it \u2014
p31
aVnow, scoop up Longs Peak and put it out in space.
p32
aVTake ... Meeker, Mt. Meeker.
p33
aVLump that in there, and put that in space as well.
p34
aVAnd Mt. Everest. And K2.
p35
aVAnd the Indian peaks.
p36
aVThen you're starting to get an idea of how much rock we're talking about, OK?
p37
aVWe know it was that big
p38
aVbecause of the impact it had and the crater it left.
p39
aVIt hit in what we now know as Yucatan, the Gulf of Mexico.
p40
aVYou can see here, there's the Yucatan Peninsula,
p41
aVif you recognize Cozumel off the east coast there.
p42
aVHere is how big of a crater was left.
p43
aVIt was huge.
p44
aa(lp45
VTo give you a sense of the scale ... there you go.
p46
aVThe scale here is 50 miles on top, a hundred kilometers on the bottom.
p47
aVThis thing was 300 kilometers across \u2014 200 miles \u2014
p48
aVan enormous crater that excavated out vast amounts of earth
p49
aVthat splashed around the globe and set fires all over the planet,
p50
aVthrew up enough dust to block out the sun.
p51
aVIt wiped out 75 percent of all species on Earth.
p52
aVNow, not all asteroids are that big.
p53
aa(lp54
VSome of them are smaller.
p55
aVHere is one that came in
p56
aVover the United States in October of 1992.
p57
aVIt came in on a Friday night.
p58
aVWhy is that important?
p59
aVBecause back then, video cameras were just starting to become popular,
p60
aVand parents would bring them to their kids' football games
p61
aVto film their kids playing football.
p62
aVAnd since this came in on a Friday,
p63
aVthey were able to get this great footage of this thing breaking up
p64
aVas it came in over West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and New Jersey
p65
aVuntil it did that
p66
aVto a car in New York.
p67
aa(lp68
V(Laughter)
p69
aa(lp70
VNow, this is not a 200-mile-wide crater,
p71
aVbut then again, you can see the rock, which is sitting right here,
p72
aVabout the size of a football,
p73
aVthat hit that car and did that damage.
p74
aVNow, this thing was probably about the size of a school bus
p75
aVwhen it first came in.
p76
aVIt broke up through atmospheric pressure,
p77
aVit crumbled, and then the pieces fell apart
p78
aVand did some damage.
p79
aVNow, you wouldn't want that falling on your foot or your head,
p80
aVbecause it would do that to it.
p81
aVThat would be bad.
p82
aVBut it won't wipe out, you know, all life on Earth, so that's fine.
p83
aa(lp84
VBut it turns out, you don't need something six miles across
p85
aVto do a lot of damage.
p86
aVThere is a median point between tiny rock and gigantic rock,
p87
aVand in fact, if any of you have ever been to near Winslow, Arizona,
p88
aVthere is a crater in the desert there that is so iconic
p89
aVthat it is actually called "Meteor Crater."
p90
aVTo give you a sense of scale, this is about a mile wide.
p91
aVIf you look up at the top, that's a parking lot,
p92
aVand those are recreational vehicles right there.
p93
aVSo it's about a mile across, 600 feet deep.
p94
aVThe object that formed this was probably about 30 to 50 yards across,
p95
aVso roughly the size of Macky Auditorium here.
p96
aVIt came in at speeds that were tremendous,
p97
aVslammed into the ground, blew up,
p98
aVand exploded with the energy of roughly a 20-megaton nuclear bomb \u2014
p99
aVa very hefty bomb.
p100
aVThis was 50,000 years ago,
p101
aVso it may have wiped out a few buffalo or antelope,
p102
aVor something like that out in the desert,
p103
aVbut it probably would not have caused global devastation.
p104
aa(lp105
VIt turns out that these things don't have to hit the ground
p106
aVto do a lot of damage.
p107
aVNow, in 1908, over Siberia, near the Tunguska region \u2014
p108
aVfor those of you who are Dan Aykroyd fans and saw "Ghostbusters,"
p109
aVwhen he talked about the greatest cross-dimensional rift
p110
aVsince the Siberia blast of 1909,
p111
aVwhere he got the date wrong, but that's OK.
p112
aa(lp113
V(Laughter)
p114
aa(lp115
VIt was 1908. That's fine. I can live with that.
p116
aa(lp117
V(Laughter)
p118
aa(lp119
VAnother rock came into the Earth's atmosphere
p120
aVand this one blew up above the ground,
p121
aVseveral miles up above the surface of the Earth.
p122
aVThe heat from the explosion set fire to the forest below it,
p123
aVand then the shock wave came down and knocked down trees
p124
aVfor hundreds of square miles.
p125
aVThis did a huge amount of damage.
p126
aVAnd again, this was a rock probably roughly the size
p127
aVof this auditorium that we're sitting in.
p128
aVIn Meteor Crater, it was made of metal,
p129
aVand metal is much tougher, so it made it to the ground.
p130
aVThe one over Tunguska was probably made of rock,
p131
aVand that's much more crumbly, so it blew up in the air.
p132
aa(lp133
VEither way, these are tremendous explosions \u2014 20 megatons.
p134
aVNow, when these things blow up,
p135
aVthey're not going to do global ecological damage.
p136
aVThey're not going to do something like the dinosaur killer did.
p137
aVThey're just not big enough.
p138
aVBut they will do global economic damage,
p139
aVbecause they don't have to hit, necessarily,
p140
aVto do this kind of damage.
p141
aVThey don't have to do global devastation.
p142
aVIf one of these things were to hit pretty much anywhere,
p143
aVit would cause a panic.
p144
aVBut if it came over a city, an important city \u2014
p145
aVnot that any city is more important than others,
p146
aVbut some of them we depend on more on the global economic basis \u2014
p147
aVthat could do a huge amount of damage to us as a civilization.
p148
aVSo, now that I've scared the crap out of you \u2014
p149
aa(lp150
V(Laughter)
p151
aa(lp152
Vwhat can we do about this?
p153
aVThis is a potential threat.
p154
aVLet me note that we have not had a giant impact like the dinosaur killer
p155
aVfor 65 million years.
p156
aVThey're very rare.
p157
aVThe smaller ones happen more often,
p158
aVbut probably on the order of a millennium,
p159
aVevery few centuries or every few thousand years.
p160
aVBut it's still something to be aware of.
p161
aVWell, what do we do about them?
p162
aVThe first thing we have to do is find them.
p163
aVThis is an image of an asteroid that passed us in 2009.
p164
aVIt's right here.
p165
aVBut you can see that it's extremely faint.
p166
aVI don't know if you can see that in the back row.
p167
aVThese are just stars.
p168
aa(lp169
VThis is a rock that was about 30 yards across,
p170
aVso roughly the size of the ones that blew up over Tunguska
p171
aVand hit Arizona 50,000 years ago.
p172
aVThese things are faint.
p173
aVThey're hard to see, and the sky is really big.
p174
aVWe have to find these things first.
p175
aVWell, the good news is, we're looking for them.
p176
aVNASA has devoted money to this;
p177
aVthe National Science Foundation and other countries
p178
aVare interested in doing this.
p179
aVWe're building telescopes that are looking for the threat.
p180
aa(lp181
VThat's a great first step. But what's the second step?
p182
aVThe second step is if we see one heading toward us, we have to stop it.
p183
aVWhat do we do?
p184
aVYou've probably heard about the asteroid Apophis.
p185
aVIf you haven't yet, you will.
p186
aVIf you've heard about the Mayan 2012 apocalypse,
p187
aVyou're going to hear about Apophis,
p188
aVbecause you're keyed in to all the doomsday networks, anyway.
p189
aa(lp190
V(Laughter)
p191
aa(lp192
VApophis is an asteroid that was discovered in 2004.
p193
aVIt's roughly 250 [meters] across, so it's pretty big \u2014
p194
aVbigger than a football stadium.
p195
aVAnd it's going to pass by the Earth in April of 2029.
p196
aVAnd it's going to pass us so close
p197
aVthat it's actually going to come underneath our weather satellites.
p198
aVThe Earth's gravity is going to bend the orbit of this thing so much
p199
aVthat if it's just right,
p200
aVif it passes through this region of space,
p201
aVthis kidney-bean-shaped region called the keyhole,
p202
aVthe Earth's gravity will bend it just enough that seven years later,
p203
aVon April 13 \u2014 which is a Friday, I'll note \u2014 in the year 2036 \u2014
p204
aa(lp205
V(Laughter)
p206
aa(lp207
Vyou can't plan that kind of stuff \u2014
p208
aa(lp209
V(Laughter)
p210
aa(lp211
VApophis is going to hit us.
p212
aVAnd it's 250 meters across, so it would do unbelievable damage.
p213
aVThe good news is that the odds of it actually passing through this keyhole
p214
aVand hitting us next go-around are one in a million, roughly \u2014
p215
aVvery, very low odds.
p216
aVSo I personally am not lying awake at night worrying about this at all.
p217
aVI don't think Apophis is a problem.
p218
aVIn fact, Apophis is a blessing in disguise,
p219
aVbecause it woke us up to the dangers of these things.
p220
aVThis thing was discovered just a few years ago
p221
aVand could hit us a few years from now.
p222
aVIt won't, but it gives us a chance to study these kinds of asteroids.
p223
aa(lp224
VWe didn't really necessarily understand these keyholes, and now we do,
p225
aVand it turns out that's really important,
p226
aVbecause how do you stop an asteroid like this?
p227
aVWell, let me ask you:
p228
aVWhat happens if you're standing in the road and a car's headed for you?
p229
aVWhat do you do?
p230
aVYou do this. Right? Move, and the car goes past you.
p231
aVBut we can't move the Earth, at least not easily,
p232
aVbut we can move a small asteroid.
p233
aa(lp234
VAnd it turns out, we've even done it.
p235
aVIn the year 2005, NASA launched a probe called Deep Impact,
p236
aVwhich slammed a piece of itself into the nucleus of a comet.
p237
aVComets are very much like asteroids.
p238
aVThe purpose wasn't to push it out of the way;
p239
aVthe purpose was to make a crater to excavate the material
p240
aVand see what was underneath the surface of this comet,
p241
aVwhich we learned quite a bit about.
p242
aVWe did move the comet a little tiny bit \u2014
p243
aVnot very much, but that wasn't the point.
p244
aVHowever, think about this:
p245
aVThis thing is orbiting the Sun at 10, 20 miles per second.
p246
aVWe shot a space probe at it and hit it, OK?
p247
aVImagine how hard that must be, and we did it.
p248
aVThat means we can do it again.
p249
aVIf we see an asteroid that's coming toward us, headed right for us,
p250
aVand we have two years to go?
p251
aVBoom! We hit it.
p252
aVYou know, if you watch the movies \u2014
p253
aa(lp254
V(Laughter)
p255
aa(lp256
Vyou might think:
p257
aVWhy don't we use a nuclear weapon?
p258
aVWell, you can try that, but the problem is timing.
p259
aVShoot a nuclear weapon at this thing,
p260
aVyou have to blow it up within a few milliseconds of tolerance,
p261
aVor else you'll miss it.
p262
aVAnd there are a lot of other problems with that; it's very hard to do.
p263
aVBut just hitting something? That's pretty easy.
p264
aVI think even NASA can do that, and proved that they can.
p265
aa(lp266
V(Laughter)
p267
aa(lp268
VThe problem is, if you hit this asteroid, you've changed the orbit,
p269
aVyou measure the orbit,
p270
aVthen you find out, oh yeah, we just pushed it into a keyhole,
p271
aVand now it's going to hit us in three years.
p272
aVWell, my opinion is: fine!
p273
aVIt's not hitting us in six months \u2014
p274
aVthat's good.
p275
aa(lp276
VNow we have three years to do something else.
p277
aVAnd you can hit it again.
p278
aVThat's kind of ham-fisted;
p279
aVyou might just push it into a third keyhole or whatever,
p280
aVso you don't do that.
p281
aVAnd this is the part \u2014
p282
aVit's the part I just love.
p283
aa(lp284
V(Laughter)
p285
aa(lp286
VAfter the big macho "Grr ... bam! We're gonna hit this thing in the face,"
p287
aVthen we bring in the velvet gloves.
p288
aa(lp289
V(Laughter)
p290
aa(lp291
VThere's a group of scientists and engineers and astronauts,
p292
aVand they call themselves The B612 Foundation.
p293
aVFor those of you who've read "The Little Prince,"
p294
aVyou understand that reference, I hope \u2014
p295
aVthe little prince lived on an asteroid called B612.
p296
aVThese are smart guys \u2014 men and women \u2014 astronauts, like I said, engineers.
p297
aVRusty Schweickart, who was an Apollo 9 astronaut, is on this.
p298
aVDan Durda, my friend who made this image,
p299
aVworks here at Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, on Walnut Street.
p300
aVHe created this image for this.
p301
aVHe's actually one of the astronomers who works for them.
p302
aVIf we see an asteroid that's going to hit the Earth
p303
aVand we have enough time,
p304
aVwe can hit it to move it into a better orbit.
p305
aa(lp306
VBut then what we do is launch a probe that has to weigh a ton or two.
p307
aVIt doesn't have to be huge \u2014 a couple of tons, not that big \u2014
p308
aVand you park it near the asteroid.
p309
aVYou don't land on it, because these things are tumbling end over end.
p310
aVIt's very hard to land on them.
p311
aVInstead you get near it.
p312
aVThe gravity of the asteroid pulls on the probe,
p313
aVand the probe has a couple of tons of mass.
p314
aVIt has a little tiny bit of gravity,
p315
aVbut it's enough that it can pull the asteroid,
p316
aVand you have your rocket set up \u2014
p317
aVyou can barely see it here, but there's rocket plumes \u2014
p318
aVand these guys are connected by their own gravity,
p319
aVand if you move the probe very slowly \u2014 very, very gently,
p320
aVyou can very easily finesse that rock into a safe orbit.
p321
aVYou can even put in orbit around the Earth where we could mine it,
p322
aValthough that's a whole other thing; I won't go into that.
p323
aa(lp324
V(Laughter)
p325
aa(lp326
VBut we'd be rich!
p327
aa(lp328
V(Laughter)
p329
aa(lp330
VSo think about this, right?
p331
aVThere are these giant rocks flying out there, and they're hitting us,
p332
aVand they're doing damage to us.
p333
aVBut we've figured out how to do this,
p334
aVand all the pieces are in place to do this.
p335
aVWe have astronomers with telescopes, looking for them.
p336
aVWe have very, very smart people,
p337
aVwho are concerned about this and figuring out how to fix the problem,
p338
aVand we have the technology to do this.
p339
aVThis probe actually can't use chemical rockets.
p340
aVChemical rockets provide too much thrust, too much push.
p341
aVThe probe would just shoot away.
p342
aa(lp343
VWe invented something called an ion drive,
p344
aVwhich is a very, very, very low-thrust engine.
p345
aVIt generates the force a piece of paper would have on your hand \u2014
p346
aVincredibly light, but it can run for months and years,
p347
aVproviding that very gentle push.
p348
aVIf anybody here is a fan of the original "Star Trek,"
p349
aVthey ran across an alien ship that had an ion drive,
p350
aVand Spock said, "They're very technically sophisticated.
p351
aVThey're a hundred years ahead of us with this drive."
p352
aVYeah, we have an ion drive now.
p353
aVWe don't have the Enterprise, but we've got an ion drive now.
p354
aa(lp355
V(Laughter)
p356
aa(lp357
V(Applause)
p358
aa(lp359
VSpock.
p360
aa(lp361
V(Laughter)
p362
aVSo ...
p363
aVThat's the difference \u2014
p364
aVthat's the difference between us and the dinosaurs.
p365
aVThis happened to them.
p366
aVIt doesn't have to happen to us.
p367
aVThe difference between the dinosaurs and us
p368
aVis that we have a space program
p369
aVand we can vote,
p370
aVand so we can change our future.
p371
aa(lp372
V(Laughter)
p373
aa(lp374
VWe have the ability to change our future.
p375
aVSixty-five million years from now,
p376
aVwe don't have to have our bones collecting dust in a museum.
p377
aVThank you very much.
