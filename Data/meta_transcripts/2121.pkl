VSo this is Anna Hazare,
p4
aVand Anna Hazare may well be the most cutting-edge
p5
aVdigital activist in the world today.
p6
aVAnd you wouldn't know it by looking at him.
p7
aVHazare is a 77-year-old Indian  anticorruption and social justice activist.
p8
aVAnd in 2011, he was running a big campaign
p9
aVto address everyday corruption in India,
p10
aVa topic that Indian elites love to ignore.
p11
aVSo as part of this campaign,
p12
aVhe was using all of the traditional tactics
p13
aVthat a good Gandhian organizer would use.
p14
aVSo he was on a hunger strike,
p15
aVand Hazare realized through his hunger
p16
aVthat actually maybe this time,
p17
aVin the 21st century,
p18
aVa hunger strike wouldn't be enough.
p19
aa(lp20
VSo he started playing around  with mobile activism.
p21
aVSo the first thing he did  is he said to people,
p22
aV"Okay, why don't you send me
p23
aVa text message if you support
p24
aVmy campaign against corruption?"
p25
aVSo he does this, he  gives people a short code,
p26
aVand about 80,000 people do it.
p27
aVOkay, that's pretty respectable.
p28
aVBut then he decides,
p29
aV"Let me tweak my tactics a little bit."
p30
aVHe says, "Why don't you leave me a missed call?"
p31
aVNow, for those of you who have lived in the global South,
p32
aVyou'll know that missed calls
p33
aVare a really critical part of global mobile culture.
p34
aVI see people nodding.
p35
aVPeople leave missed calls all the time:
p36
aVIf you're running late for a meeting
p37
aVand you just want to let them know that you're on the way,
p38
aVyou leave them a missed call.
p39
aVIf you're dating someone and  you just want to say "I miss you"
p40
aVyou leave them a missed call.
p41
aVSo a note for a dating tip here,
p42
aVin some cultures,
p43
aVif you want to please your lover,
p44
aVyou call them and hang up. (Laughter)
p45
aVSo why do people leave missed calls?
p46
aVWell, the reason of course is that
p47
aVthey're trying to avoid charges
p48
aVassociated with making calls and sending texts.
p49
aa(lp50
VSo when Hazare asked people  to leave him a missed call,
p51
aVlet's have a little guess how  many people actually did this?
p52
aVThirty-five million.
p53
aVSo this is one of the largest coordinated actions in human history.
p54
aVIt's remarkable.
p55
aVAnd this reflects the extraordinary strength  of the emerging Indian middle class
p56
aVand the power that their mobile phones bring.
p57
aVBut he used that,
p58
aVHazare ended up with this massive  CSV file of mobile phone numbers,
p59
aVand he used that to deploy
p60
aVreal people power on the ground
p61
aVto get hundreds of thousands of people out on the streets in Delhi
p62
aVto make a national point of  everyday corruption in India.
p63
aVIt's a really striking story.
p64
aa(lp65
VSo this is me when I was 12 years old.
p66
aVI hope you see the resemblance.
p67
aVAnd I was also an activist,
p68
aVand I have been an activist all my life.
p69
aVI had this really funny childhood
p70
aVwhere I traipsed around the world
p71
aVmeeting world leaders and  Noble prize winners,
p72
aVtalking about Third World debt,
p73
aVas it was then called,
p74
aVand demilitarization.
p75
aVI was a very, very serious child. (Laughter)
p76
aVAnd back then,
p77
aVin the early '90s,
p78
aVI had a very cutting-edge tech tool of my own:
p79
aVthe fax.
p80
aVAnd the fax was the  tool of my activism.
p81
aVAnd at that time, it was the best way
p82
aVto get a message to a lot of people
p83
aVall at once.
p84
aVI'll give you one example of a fax campaign that I ran.
p85
aVIt was the eve of the Gulf War
p86
aVand I organized a global campaign  to flood the hotel,
p87
aVthe Intercontinental in Geneva,
p88
aVwhere James Baker and Tariq Aziz
p89
aVwere meeting on the eve of the war,
p90
aVand I thought if I could  flood them with faxes,
p91
aVwe'll stop the war.
p92
aa(lp93
VWell, unsurprisingly,
p94
aVthat campaign was wholly unsuccessful.
p95
aVThere are lots of reasons for that,
p96
aVbut there's no doubt that  one sputtering fax machine
p97
aVin Geneva was a little bit of a bandwidth constraint
p98
aVin terms of the ability to  get a message to lots of people.
p99
aVAnd so, I went on to  discover some better tools.
p100
aVI cofounded Avaaz, which uses the  Internet to mobilize people
p101
aVand now has almost  40 million members,
p102
aVand I now run Purpose, which  is a home for these kinds of
p103
aVtechnology-powered movements.
p104
aVSo what's the moral of this story?
p105
aVIs the moral of this story,
p106
aVyou know what, the fax is kind of eclipsed by the mobile phone?
p107
aVThis is another story of  tech-determinism?
p108
aVWell, I would argue that there's  actually more to it than that.
p109
aVI'd argue that in the last 20 years,
p110
aVsomething more fundamental has changed
p111
aVthan just new tech.
p112
aVI would argue that there has been a fundamental shift
p113
aVin the balance of power
p114
aVin the world.
p115
aa(lp116
VYou ask any activist how  to understand the world,
p117
aVand they'll say, "Look at where the power is,
p118
aVwho has it, how it's shifting."
p119
aVAnd I think we all sense that  something big is happening.
p120
aa(lp121
VSo Henry Timms and I \u2014
p122
aVHenry's a fellow movement builder \u2014
p123
aVgot talking one day and  we started to think,
p124
aVhow can we make sense of this new world?
p125
aVHow can we describe it and give
p126
aVit a framework that makes it more useful?
p127
aVBecause we realized that many
p128
aVof the lessons that we were discovering in movements
p129
aVactually applied all over the world
p130
aVin many sectors of our society.
p131
aVSo I want to introduce you to this framework:
p132
aVOld power, meet new power.
p133
aVAnd I want to talk to you about what new power is today.
p134
aVNew power is the deployment
p135
aVof mass participation  and peer coordination \u2014
p136
aVthese are the two key elements \u2014
p137
aVto create change and shift outcomes.
p138
aVAnd we see new power all around us.
p139
aa(lp140
VThis is Beppe Grillo
p141
aVhe was a populist Italian blogger
p142
aVwho, with a minimal political apparatus and only some online tools,
p143
aVwon more than 25 percent of the vote
p144
aVin recent Italian elections.
p145
aVThis is Airbnb,
p146
aVwhich in just a few years
p147
aVhas radically disrupted the hotel industry
p148
aVwithout owning a single square foot of real estate.
p149
aVThis is Kickstarter,
p150
aVwhich we know has raised over a billion dollars
p151
aVfrom more than five million people.
p152
aVNow, we're familiar with all of these models.
p153
aVBut what's striking is the commonalities,
p154
aVthe structural features of  these new models
p155
aVand how they differ from old power.
p156
aa(lp157
VLet's look a little bit at this.
p158
aVOld power is held like a currency.
p159
aVNew power works like a current.
p160
aVOld power is held by a few.
p161
aVNew power isn't held by a few, it's made by many.
p162
aVOld power is all about download,
p163
aVand new power uploads.
p164
aVAnd you see a whole set of  characteristics that you can trace,
p165
aVwhether it's in media or  politics or education.
p166
aa(lp167
VSo we've talked a little bit  about what new power is.
p168
aVLet's, for a second, talk about  what new power isn't.
p169
aVNew power is not your Facebook page.
p170
aVI assure you that having a  social media strategy
p171
aVcan enable you to do just as much download
p172
aVas you used to do when you had the radio.
p173
aVJust ask Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad,
p174
aVI assure you that his Facebook page
p175
aVhas not embraced the power of participation.
p176
aVNew power is not inherently positive.
p177
aVIn fact, this isn't an normative argument that we're making,
p178
aVthere are many good things  about new power,
p179
aVbut it can produce bad outcomes.
p180
aVMore participation, more peer coordination,
p181
aVsometimes distorts outcomes
p182
aVand there are some things,
p183
aVlike things, for example,  in the medical profession
p184
aVthat we want new power  to get nowhere near.
p185
aVAnd thirdly, new power is not the inevitable victor.
p186
aVIn fact, unsurprisingly,
p187
aVas many of these new power models get to scale,
p188
aVwhat you see is this massive pushback
p189
aVfrom the forces of old power.
p190
aVJust look at this really  interesting epic struggle
p191
aVgoing on right now between  Edward Snowden and the NSA.
p192
aVYou'll note that only one of  the two people on this slide
p193
aVis currently in exile.
p194
aVAnd so, it's not at all clear
p195
aVthat new power will be  the inevitable victor.
p196
aa(lp197
VThat said, keep one thing in mind:
p198
aVWe're at the beginning of a very steep curve.
p199
aVSo you think about some of  these new power models, right?
p200
aVThese were just like someone's
p201
aVgarage idea a few years ago,
p202
aVand now they're disrupting  entire industries.
p203
aVAnd so, what's interesting about new power,
p204
aVis the way it feeds on itself.
p205
aVOnce you have an experience of new power,
p206
aVyou tend to expect and  want more of it.
p207
aVSo let's say you've used a peer-to-peer lending platform
p208
aVlike Lending Tree or Prosper,
p209
aVthen you've figured out that you don't need the bank,
p210
aVand who wants the bank, right?
p211
aVAnd so, that experience tends  to embolden you
p212
aVit tends to make you want more participation
p213
aVacross more aspects of your life.
p214
aVAnd what this gives rise to is
p215
aVa set of values.
p216
aVWe talked about the models
p217
aVthat new power has engendered \u2014
p218
aVthe Airbnbs, the Kickstarters.
p219
aVWhat about the values?
p220
aVAnd this is an early sketch
p221
aVat what new power values look like.
p222
aa(lp223
VNew power values prize transparency above all else.
p224
aVIt's almost a religious  belief in transparency,
p225
aVa belief that if you shine  a light on something,
p226
aVit will be better.
p227
aVAnd remember that in the 20th  century, this was not at all true.
p228
aVPeople thought that gentlemen should sit behind closed doors
p229
aVand make comfortable agreements.
p230
aVNew power values of informal, networked governance.
p231
aVNew power folks would never  have invented the U.N. today,
p232
aVfor better or worse.
p233
aVNew power values participation,
p234
aVand new power is all about do-it-yourself.
p235
aVIn fact, what's interesting  about new power
p236
aVis that it eschews some of  the professionalization
p237
aVand specialization that was
p238
aVall the rage in the 20th century.
p239
aa(lp240
VSo what's interesting about these
p241
aVnew power values and these new power models
p242
aVis what they mean for organizations.
p243
aVSo we've spent a bit of time thinking,
p244
aVhow can we plot organizations
p245
aVon a two-by-two where, essentially,
p246
aVwe look at new power values
p247
aVand new power models
p248
aVand see where different people sit?
p249
aVWe started with a U.S. analysis,
p250
aVand let me show you  some interesting findings.
p251
aVSo the first is Apple.
p252
aVIn this framework, we actually described Apple
p253
aVas an old power company.
p254
aVThat's because the ideology,
p255
aVthe governing ideology of Apple
p256
aVis the ideology of the perfectionist
p257
aVproduct designer in Cupertino.
p258
aVIt's absolutely about that beautiful,  perfect thing descending upon us
p259
aVin perfection.
p260
aVAnd it does not value, as a  company, transparency.
p261
aVIn fact, it's very secretive.
p262
aVNow, Apple is one of the most succesful companies in the world.
p263
aVSo this shows that you can
p264
aVstill pursue a successful  old power strategy.
p265
aVBut one can argue that there's  real vulnerabilites in that model.
p266
aVI think another interesting comparison
p267
aVis that of the Obama campaign
p268
aVversus the Obama presidency.
p269
aV(Applause)
p270
aVNow, I like President Obama,
p271
aVbut he ran with new  power at his back, right?
p272
aVAnd he said to people,
p273
aVwe are the ones we've been waiting for.
p274
aVAnd he used crowdfunding
p275
aVto power a campaign.
p276
aVBut when he got into office,
p277
aVhe governed like more or less  all the other presidents did.
p278
aVAnd this is a really interesting trend,
p279
aVis when new power gets powerful,
p280
aVwhat happens?
p281
aVSo this is a framework you  should look at
p282
aVand think about where your own organization
p283
aVsits on it.
p284
aVAnd think about where it should be
p285
aVin five or 10 years.
p286
aVSo what do you do if you're old power?
p287
aVWell, if you're there  thinking, in old power,
p288
aVthis won't happen to us.
p289
aVThen just look at the Wikipedia entry for Encyclopædia Britannica.
p290
aVLet me tell you, it's a very sad read.
p291
aa(lp292
VBut if you are old power,
p293
aVthe most important thing you  can do is to occupy yourself
p294
aVbefore others occupy you,
p295
aVbefore you are occupied.
p296
aVImagine that a group of your biggest skeptics
p297
aVare camped in the heart of your organization
p298
aVasking the toughest questions
p299
aVand they can see everything inside of your organization.
p300
aVAnd ask them, would they  like what they see
p301
aVand should our model change?
p302
aVWhat about if you're new power?
p303
aVIs new power kind of just  riding the wave to glory?
p304
aVI would argue no.
p305
aVI would argue that there are some very real challenges
p306
aVto new power in this nascent phase.
p307
aVLet's stick with the Occupy Wall Street example for a moment.
p308
aVOccupy was this incredible example  of new power,
p309
aVthe purest example of new power.
p310
aVAnd yet, it failed to consolidate.
p311
aVSo the energy that it created
p312
aVwas great for the meme phase,
p313
aVbut they were so committed to participation,
p314
aVthat they never got anything done.
p315
aVAnd in fact that model
p316
aVmeans that the challenge for new power is:
p317
aVhow do you use institutional power
p318
aVwithout being institutionalized?
p319
aa(lp320
VOne the other end of the spectra is Uber.
p321
aVUber is an amazing,
p322
aVhighly scalable new power model.
p323
aVThat network is getting denser and denser
p324
aVby the day.
p325
aVBut what's really interesting  about Uber is
p326
aVit hasn't really adopted new power values.
p327
aVThis is a real quote from  the Uber CEO recently:
p328
aVHe says, "Once we get rid of the dude  in the car" \u2014 he means drivers \u2014
p329
aV"Uber will be cheaper."
p330
aVNow, new power models live and die
p331
aVby the strength of their networks.
p332
aVBy whether the drivers and the consumers
p333
aVwho use the service actually believe in it.
p334
aVBecause they're not an exercise  of top-down perfectionism,
p335
aVthey are about the network.
p336
aVAnd so, the challenge,
p337
aVand this is why it's in no way surprising,
p338
aVis that Uber's drivers  are now unionizing.
p339
aVIt's extraordinary.
p340
aVUber's drivers are turning on Uber.
p341
aVAnd the challenge for Uber \u2014
p342
aVthis isn't an easy situation for them \u2014
p343
aVis that they are locked into a broader superstrcuture
p344
aVthat is really old power.
p345
aVThey've raised more than a billion  dollars in the capital markets.
p346
aVThose markets expect a financial return,
p347
aVand they way you get a financial return
p348
aVis by squeezing and squeezing
p349
aVyour users and your drivers
p350
aVfor more and more value
p351
aVand giving that value to your investors.
p352
aa(lp353
VSo the big question about the future  of new power, in my view, is:
p354
aVWill that old power just emerge?
p355
aVSo will new power elites just become
p356
aVold power and squeeze?
p357
aVOr will that new power base bite back?
p358
aVWill the next big Uber
p359
aVbe co-owned by Uber drivers?
p360
aVAnd I think this going  to be a very interesting
p361
aVstructural question.
p362
aa(lp363
VFinally, think about new power
p364
aVbeing more than just an
p365
aVentity that scales things
p366
aVthat make us have slightly  better consumer experiences.
p367
aVMy call to action for new power
p368
aVis to not be an island.
p369
aVWe have major structural problems in the world today
p370
aVthat could benefit enormously
p371
aVfrom the kinds of mass participation
p372
aVand peer coordination
p373
aVthat these new power players
p374
aVknow so well how to generate.
p375
aVAnd we badly need them to  turn their energies and their power
p376
aVto big, what economists might call
p377
aVpublic goods problems,
p378
aVthat are often beyond markets
p379
aVwhere investors can easily be found.
p380
aVAnd I think if we can do that,
p381
aVwe might be able to fundamentally change
p382
aVnot only human beings' sense of  their own agency and power \u2014
p383
aVbecause I think that's the most wonderful thing about new power,
p384
aVis that people feel more powerful \u2014
p385
aVbut we might also be able to change
p386
aVthe way we relate to each other
p387
aVand the way we relate to  authority and institutions.
p388
aVAnd to me, that's absolutely
p389
aVworth trying for.
p390
aVThank you very much.
