VGrowing up, I didn't always understand
p4
aVwhy my parents made me follow the rules that they did.
p5
aVLike, why did I really  have to mow the lawn?
p6
aVWhy was homework really that important?
p7
aVWhy couldn't I put jelly beans  in my oatmeal?
p8
aa(lp9
VMy childhood was abound with questions like this.
p10
aVNormal things about being a kid and realizing that sometimes,
p11
aVit was best to listen to my parents even when I didn't exactly understand why.
p12
aVAnd it's not that they didn't want me to think critically.
p13
aVTheir parenting always sought  to reconcile the tension
p14
aVbetween having my siblings and I understand the realities of the world,
p15
aVwhile ensuring that we never accepted the status quo as inevitable.
p16
aa(lp17
VI came to realize that this, in and of itself,
p18
aVwas a very purposeful form of education.
p19
aVOne of my favorite educators, Brazilian author and scholar Paulo Freire,
p20
aVspeaks quite explicitly about the need for education
p21
aVto be used as a tool for critical  awakening and shared humanity.
p22
aVIn his most famous book, "Pedagogy of the Oppressed,"
p23
aVhe states, "No one can be  authentically human
p24
aVwhile he prevents others from being so."
p25
aa(lp26
VI've been thinking a lot about this  lately, this idea of humanity,
p27
aVand specifically, who in this world is afforded the privilege
p28
aVof being perceived as fully human.
p29
aVOver the course of  the past several months,
p30
aVthe world has watched as unarmed black men, and women,
p31
aVhave had their lives taken at the hands of police and vigilante.
p32
aVThese events and all that  has transpired after them
p33
aVhave brought me back to my own childhood
p34
aVand the decisions that my parents made about raising a black boy in America
p35
aVthat growing up, I didn't always understand in the way that I do now.
p36
aa(lp37
VI think of how hard it must have been, how profoundly unfair it must have felt
p38
aVfor them to feel like they had  to strip away parts of my childhood
p39
aVjust so that I could come home at night.
p40
aa(lp41
VFor example, I think of how one night,
p42
aVwhen I was around 12 years old, on an overnight field trip to another city,
p43
aVmy friends and I bought Super Soakers
p44
aVand turned the hotel parking lot into our own water-filled battle zone.
p45
aVWe hid behind cars,
p46
aVrunning through the darkness that lay between the streetlights,
p47
aVboundless laughter ubiquitous  across the pavement.
p48
aVBut within 10 minutes,
p49
aVmy father came outside,  grabbed me by my forearm
p50
aVand led me into our room with an unfamiliar grip.
p51
aVBefore I could say anything,
p52
aVtell him how foolish he had  made me look in front of my friends,
p53
aVhe derided me for being so naive.
p54
aVLooked me in the eye,  fear consuming his face,
p55
aVand said, "Son, I'm sorry,
p56
aVbut you can't act the same  as your white friends.
p57
aVYou can't pretend to shoot guns.
p58
aVYou can't run around in the dark.
p59
aVYou can't hide behind anything other than your own teeth."
p60
aa(lp61
VI know now how scared he must have been,
p62
aVhow easily I could have fallen into the empty of the night,
p63
aVthat some man would mistake this water
p64
aVfor a good reason to wash all of this away.
p65
aa(lp66
VThese are the sorts of messages I've been inundated with my entire life:
p67
aVAlways keep your hands where they  can see them, don't move too quickly,
p68
aVtake off your hood when the sun goes down.
p69
aVMy parents raised me and my siblings in an armor of advice,
p70
aVan ocean of alarm bells so someone wouldn't steal the breath from our lungs,
p71
aVso that they wouldn't make a memory of this skin.
p72
aVSo that we could be kids,  not casket or concrete.
p73
aVAnd it's not because they thought it would make us better than anyone else
p74
aVit's simply because they wanted  to keep us alive.
p75
aa(lp76
VAll of my black friends were raised with the same message,
p77
aVthe talk, given to us  when we became old enough
p78
aVto be mistaken for a nail ready to be hammered to the ground,
p79
aVwhen people made our melanin synonymous with something to be feared.
p80
aa(lp81
VBut what does it do to a child
p82
aVto grow up knowing that you cannot simply be a child?
p83
aVThat the whims of adolescence are too dangerous for your breath,
p84
aVthat you cannot simply be curious,
p85
aVthat you are not afforded the luxury of making a mistake,
p86
aVthat someone's implicit bias
p87
aVmight be the reason you don't wake up in the morning.
p88
aa(lp89
VBut this cannot be what defines us.
p90
aVBecause we have parents who raised us to understand
p91
aVthat our bodies weren't meant for the backside of a bullet,
p92
aVbut for flying kites and jumping rope, and laughing until our stomachs burst.
p93
aVWe had teachers who taught us  how to raise our hands in class,
p94
aVand not just to signal surrender,
p95
aVand that the only thing we should give up
p96
aVis the idea that we  aren't worthy of this world.
p97
aVSo when we say that black lives matter, it's not because others don't,
p98
aVit's simply because we must affirm that we are worthy of existing without fear,
p99
aVwhen so many things tell us we are not.
p100
aVI want to live in a world where my son
p101
aVwill not be presumed guilty the moment he is born,
p102
aVwhere a toy in his hand isn't mistaken for anything other than a toy.
p103
aa(lp104
VAnd I refuse to accept that we can't build this world into something new,
p105
aVsome place where a child's name
p106
aVdoesn't have to be written  on a t-shirt, or a tombstone,
p107
aVwhere the value of someone's life
p108
aVisn't determined by anything other  than the fact that they had lungs,
p109
aVa place where every single  one of us can breathe.
