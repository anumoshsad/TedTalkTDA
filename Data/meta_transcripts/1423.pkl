VThis is Shivdutt Yadav,
p4
aVand he's from Uttar Pradesh, India.
p5
aVNow Shivdutt was visiting the local land registry office
p6
aVin Uttar Pradesh,
p7
aVand he discovered
p8
aVthat official records were listing him as dead.
p9
aVHis land was no longer registered
p10
aVin his name.
p11
aVHis brothers, Chandrabhan and Phoolchand,
p12
aVwere also listed as dead.
p13
aa(lp14
VFamily members had bribed officials
p15
aVto interrupt the hereditary transfer of land
p16
aVby having the brothers declared dead,
p17
aVallowing them to inherit
p18
aVtheir father's share of the ancestral farmland.
p19
aVBecause of this, all three brothers and their families
p20
aVhad to vacate their home.
p21
aVAccording to the Yadav family,
p22
aVthe local court has been scheduling a case review
p23
aVsince 2001,
p24
aVbut a judge has never appeared.
p25
aa(lp26
VThere are several instances in Uttar Pradesh
p27
aVof people dying
p28
aVbefore their case is given a proper review.
p29
aVShivdutt's father's death and a want for his property
p30
aVled to this corruption.
p31
aVHe was laid to rest in the Ganges River,
p32
aVwhere the dead are cremated along the banks of the river
p33
aVor tied to heavy stones and sunk in the water.
p34
aa(lp35
VPhotographing these brothers
p36
aVwas a disorienting exchange
p37
aVbecause on paper they don't exist,
p38
aVand a photograph is so often used as an evidence of life.
p39
aVYet, these men remain dead.
p40
aVThis quandary led to the title of the project,
p41
aVwhich considers in many ways
p42
aVthat we are all the living dead
p43
aVand that we in some ways represent
p44
aVghosts of the past and the future.
p45
aa(lp46
VSo this story is the first of 18 chapters
p47
aVin my new body of work titled "A Living Man Declared Dead and Other Chapters."
p48
aVAnd for this work,
p49
aVI traveled around the world over a four-year period
p50
aVresearching and recording bloodlines
p51
aVand their related stories.
p52
aVI was interested in ideas surrounding fate
p53
aVand whether our fate is determined
p54
aVby blood, chance or circumstance.
p55
aVThe subjects I documented
p56
aVranged from feuding families in Brazil
p57
aVto victims of genocide in Bosnia
p58
aVto the first woman to hijack an airplane
p59
aVand the living dead in India.
p60
aVIn each chapter, you can see the external forces
p61
aVof governance, power and territory or religion
p62
aVcolliding with the internal forces
p63
aVof psychological and physical inheritance.
p64
aa(lp65
VEach work that I make
p66
aVis comprised of three segments.
p67
aVOn the left are one or more portrait panels
p68
aVin which I systematically order
p69
aVthe members of a given bloodline.
p70
aVThis is followed by a text panel, it's designed in scroll form,
p71
aVin which I construct
p72
aVthe narrative at stake.
p73
aVAnd then on the right is what I refer to as a footnote panel.
p74
aVIt's a space that's more intuitive
p75
aVin which I present fragments of the story,
p76
aVbeginnings of other stories, photographic evidence.
p77
aVAnd it's meant to kind of reflect
p78
aVhow we engage with histories or stories on the Internet,
p79
aVin a less linear form.
p80
aVSo it's more disordered.
p81
aVAnd this disorder is in direct contrast
p82
aVto the unalterable order of a bloodline.
p83
aa(lp84
VIn my past projects I've often worked in serial form,
p85
aVdocumenting things that have
p86
aVthe appearance of being comprehensive
p87
aVthrough a determined title and a determined presentation,
p88
aVbut in fact, are fairly abstract.
p89
aVIn this project I wanted to work in the opposite direction
p90
aVand find an absolute catalog,
p91
aVsomething that I couldn't interrupt, curate or edit by choice.
p92
aVThis led me to blood.
p93
aVA bloodline is determined and ordered.
p94
aVBut the project centers
p95
aVon the collision of order and disorder \u2014
p96
aVthe order of blood butting up against the disorder
p97
aVrepresented in the often chaotic and violent stories
p98
aVthat are the subjects of my chapters.
p99
aa(lp100
VIn chapter two, I photograph the descendants of Arthur Ruppin.
p101
aVHe was sent in 1907 to Palestine
p102
aVby the Zionist organization
p103
aVto look at areas for Jewish settlement
p104
aVand acquire land for Jewish settlement.
p105
aVHe oversaw land acquisition
p106
aVon behalf of the Palestine Land Development Company
p107
aVwhose work led to the establishment
p108
aVof a Jewish state.
p109
aVThrough my research at the Zionist Archives in Jerusalem,
p110
aVI wanted to look at the early paperwork
p111
aVof the establishment of the Jewish state.
p112
aVAnd I found these maps which you see here.
p113
aVAnd these are studies
p114
aVcommissioned by the Zionist organization
p115
aVfor alternative areas for Jewish settlement.
p116
aVIn this, I was interested in the consequences
p117
aVof geography
p118
aVand imagining how the world would be different
p119
aVif Israel were in Uganda,
p120
aVwhich is what these maps demonstrate.
p121
aVThese archives in Jerusalem,
p122
aVthey maintain a card index file
p123
aVof the earliest immigrants and applicants for immigration
p124
aVto Palestine, and later Israel,
p125
aVfrom 1919 to 1965.
p126
aa(lp127
VChapter three:
p128
aVJoseph Nyamwanda Jura Ondijo
p129
aVtreated patients outside of Kisumu, Kenya
p130
aVfor AIDS, tuberculosis, infertility,
p131
aVmental illness, evil spirits.
p132
aVHe's most often paid for his services
p133
aVin cash, cows or goats.
p134
aVBut sometimes when his female patients
p135
aVcan't afford his services,
p136
aVtheir families give the women to Jura
p137
aVin exchange for medical treatment.
p138
aVAs a result of these transactions,
p139
aVJura has nine wives,
p140
aV32 children
p141
aVand 63 grandchildren.
p142
aVIn his bloodline you see the children and grandchildren here.
p143
aa(lp144
VTwo of his wives were brought to him
p145
aVsuffering from infertility
p146
aVand he cured them,
p147
aVthree for evil spirits,
p148
aVone for an asthmatic condition and severe chest pain
p149
aVand two wives Ondijo claims he took for love,
p150
aVpaying their families a total of 16 cows.
p151
aVOne wife deserted him
p152
aVand another passed away during treatment for evil spirits.
p153
aVPolygamy is widely practiced in Kenya.
p154
aVIt's common among a privileged class
p155
aVcapable of paying numerous dowries
p156
aVand keeping multiple homes.
p157
aVInstances of prominent social and political figures
p158
aVin polygamous relationships
p159
aVhas led to the perception of polygamy
p160
aVas a symbol of wealth, status and power.
p161
aa(lp162
VYou may notice in several of the chapters that I photographed
p163
aVthere are empty portraits.
p164
aVThese empty portraits represent individuals,
p165
aVliving individuals, who couldn't be present.
p166
aVAnd the reasons for their absence are given in my text panel.
p167
aVThey include dengue fever,
p168
aVimprisonment, army service,
p169
aVwomen not allowed to be photographed
p170
aVfor religious and cultural reasons.
p171
aVAnd in this particular chapter,
p172
aVit's children whose mothers
p173
aVwouldn't allow them to travel to the photographic shoot
p174
aVfor fear that their fathers would kidnap them during it.
p175
aa(lp176
VTwenty-four European rabbits
p177
aVwere brought to Australia in 1859
p178
aVby a British settler
p179
aVfor sporting purposes, for hunting.
p180
aVAnd within a hundred years,
p181
aVthat population of 24 had exploded to half a billion.
p182
aVThe European rabbit has no natural predators in Australia,
p183
aVand it competes with native wildlife
p184
aVand damages native plants
p185
aVand degrades the land.
p186
aVSince the 1950s,
p187
aVAustralia has been introducing lethal diseases
p188
aVinto the wild rabbit population
p189
aVto control growth.
p190
aVThese rabbits were bred at a government facility,
p191
aVBiosecurity Queensland,
p192
aVwhere they bred three bloodlines of rabbits
p193
aVand have infected them with a lethal disease
p194
aVand are monitoring their progress
p195
aVto see if it will effectively kill them.
p196
aVSo they're testing its virulence.
p197
aVDuring the course of this trial, all of the rabbits died,
p198
aVexcept for a few, which were euthanized.
p199
aa(lp200
VHaigh's Chocolate,
p201
aVin collaboration
p202
aVwith the Foundation for Rabbit-Free Australia,
p203
aVstopped all production of the Easter Bunny in chocolate
p204
aVand has replaced it with the Easter Bilby.
p205
aVNow this was done to counter
p206
aVthe annual celebration of rabbits
p207
aVand presumably make the public more comfortable
p208
aVwith the killing of rabbits
p209
aVand promote an animal that's native to Australia,
p210
aVand actually an animal that is threatened
p211
aVby the European rabbit.
p212
aa(lp213
VIn chapter seven, I focus on the effects
p214
aVof a genocidal act
p215
aVon one bloodline.
p216
aVSo over a two-day period,
p217
aVsix individuals from this bloodline
p218
aVwere killed in the Srebrenica massacre.
p219
aVThis is the only work
p220
aVin which I visually represent the dead.
p221
aVBut I only represent those
p222
aVthat were killed in the Srebrenica massacre,
p223
aVwhich is recorded as the largest mass murder in Europe
p224
aVsince the Second World War.
p225
aVAnd during this massacre,
p226
aV8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys
p227
aVwere systematically executed.
p228
aa(lp229
VSo when you look at a detail of this work,
p230
aVyou can see, the man on the upper-left
p231
aVis the father of the woman sitting next to him.
p232
aVHer name is Zumra.
p233
aVShe is followed by her four children,
p234
aVall of whom were killed in the Srebrenica massacre.
p235
aVFollowing those four children is Zumra's younger sister
p236
aVwho is then followed by her children
p237
aVwho were killed as well.
p238
aVDuring the time I was in Bosnia,
p239
aVthe mortal remains of Zumra's eldest son
p240
aVwere exhumed from a mass grave.
p241
aVAnd I was therefore able to photograph
p242
aVthe fully assembled remains.
p243
aVHowever, the other individuals
p244
aVare represented by these blue slides,
p245
aVwhich show tooth and bone samples
p246
aVthat were matched to DNA evidence collected from family members
p247
aVto prove they were the identities
p248
aVof those individuals.
p249
aVThey've all been given a proper burial,
p250
aVso what remains are these blue slides
p251
aVat the International Commission for Missing Persons.
p252
aa(lp253
VThese are personal effects
p254
aVdug up from a mass grave
p255
aVthat are awaiting identification from family members
p256
aVand graffiti at the Potochari battery factory,
p257
aVwhich was where the Dutch U.N. soldiers were staying,
p258
aVand also the Serbian soldiers later
p259
aVduring the times of the executions.
p260
aVThis is video footage used at the Milosevic trial,
p261
aVwhich from top to bottom
p262
aVshows a Serbian scorpion unit
p263
aVbeing blessed by an Orthodox priest
p264
aVbefore rounding up the boys and men
p265
aVand killing them.
p266
aa(lp267
VChapter 15 is more of a performance piece.
p268
aVI solicited China's State Council Information Office in 2009
p269
aVto select a multi-generational bloodline
p270
aVto represent China for this project.
p271
aVThey chose a large family from Beijing for its size,
p272
aVand they declined to give me
p273
aVany further reasoning for their choice.
p274
aVThis is one of the rare situations
p275
aVwhere I have no empty portraits.
p276
aVEveryone showed up.
p277
aVYou can also see the evolution of the one-child-only policy
p278
aVas it travels through the bloodline.
p279
aa(lp280
VPreviously known as the Department of Foreign Propaganda,
p281
aVthe State Council Information Office
p282
aVis responsible for all of China's external publicity operations.
p283
aVIt controls all foreign media and image production
p284
aVoutside of China
p285
aVfrom foreign media working within China.
p286
aVIt also monitors the Internet
p287
aVand instructs local media
p288
aVon how to handle any potentially controversial issues,
p289
aVincluding Tibet, ethnic minorities,
p290
aVHuman Rights, religion,
p291
aVdemocracy movements and terrorism.
p292
aVFor the footnote panel in this work,
p293
aVthis office instructed me
p294
aVto photograph their central television tower in Beijing.
p295
aVAnd I also photographed the gift bag they gave me
p296
aVwhen I left.
p297
aa(lp298
VThese are the descendants of Hans Frank
p299
aVwho was Hitler's personal legal advisor
p300
aVand governor general of occupied Poland.
p301
aVNow this bloodline includes numerous empty portraits,
p302
aVhighlighting a complex relationship
p303
aVto one's family history.
p304
aVThe reasons for these absences
p305
aVinclude people who declined participation.
p306
aVThere's also parents who participated
p307
aVwho wouldn't let their children participate
p308
aVbecause they thought they were too young to decide for themselves.
p309
aVAnother section of the family
p310
aVpresented their clothing, as opposed to their physical presence,
p311
aVbecause they didn't want to be identified
p312
aVwith the past that I was highlighting.
p313
aVAnd finally, another individual
p314
aVsat for me from behind
p315
aVand later rescinded his participation,
p316
aVso I had to pixelate him out so he's unrecognizable.
p317
aa(lp318
VIn the footnote panel that accompanies this work
p319
aVI photographed an official Adolph Hitler postage stamp
p320
aVand an imitation of that stamp
p321
aVproduced by British Intelligence
p322
aVwith Hans Frank's image on it.
p323
aVIt was released in Poland
p324
aVto create friction between Frank and Hitler,
p325
aVso that Hitler would imagine
p326
aVFrank was trying to usurp his power.
p327
aa(lp328
VAgain, talking about fate,
p329
aVI was interested in the stories and fate
p330
aVof particular works of art.
p331
aVThese paintings were taken by Hans Frank
p332
aVduring the time of the Third Reich.
p333
aVAnd I'm interested in the impact of their absence and presence through time.
p334
aVThey are Leonardo da Vinci's "Lady With an Ermine,"
p335
aVRembrandt's "Landscape With Good Samaritan"
p336
aVand Raphael's "Portrait of a Youth,"
p337
aVwhich has never been found.
p338
aa(lp339
VChapter 12 highlights
p340
aVpeople being born into a battle that is not of their making,
p341
aVbut becomes their own.
p342
aVSo this is the Ferraz family
p343
aVand the Novaes family.
p344
aVAnd they are in an active blood feud.
p345
aVThis feud has been going on since 1991
p346
aVin Northeast Brazil in Pernambuco,
p347
aVand it involved the deaths
p348
aVof 20 members of the families
p349
aVand 40 others associated with the feud,
p350
aVincluding hired hit men, innocent bystanders
p351
aVand friends.
p352
aVTensions between these two families date back to 1913
p353
aVwhen there was a dispute over local political power.
p354
aVBut it got violent in the last two decades
p355
aVand includes decapitation
p356
aVand the death of two mayors.
p357
aVInstalled into a protective wall
p358
aVsurrounding the suburban home of Louis Novaes,
p359
aVwho's the head of the Novaes family,
p360
aVare these turret holes,
p361
aVwhich were used for shooting and looking.
p362
aa(lp363
VBrazil's northeast state of Pernambuco
p364
aVis one of the nation's most violent regions.
p365
aVIt's rooted in a principle of retributive justice,
p366
aVor an eye for an eye,
p367
aVso retaliatory killings
p368
aVhave led to several deaths in the area.
p369
aVThis story, like many of the stories in my chapters,
p370
aVreads almost as an archetypal episode,
p371
aVlike something out of Shakespeare,
p372
aVthat's happening now and will happen again in the future.
p373
aVI'm interested in these ideas of repetition.
p374
aVSo after I returned home, I received word
p375
aVthat one member of the family
p376
aVhad been shot 30 times in the face.
p377
aa(lp378
VChapter 17
p379
aVis an exploration of the absence of a bloodline
p380
aVand the absence of a history.
p381
aVChildren at this Ukrainian orphanage
p382
aVare between the ages of six and 16.
p383
aVThis piece is ordered by age
p384
aVbecause it can't be ordered by blood.
p385
aVIn a 12-month period when I was at the orphanage,
p386
aVonly one child had been adopted.
p387
aVChildren have to leave the orphanage at age 16,
p388
aVdespite the fact that there's often nowhere for them to go.
p389
aVIt's commonly reported in Ukraine
p390
aVthat children, when leaving the orphanage
p391
aVare targeted for human trafficking,
p392
aVchild pornography and prostitution.
p393
aVMany have to turn to criminal activity for their survival,
p394
aVand high rates of suicide are recorded.
p395
aa(lp396
VThis is a boys' bedroom.
p397
aVThere's an insufficient supply of beds at the orphanage
p398
aVand not enough warm clothing.
p399
aVChildren bathe infrequently
p400
aVbecause the hot water isn't turned on until October.
p401
aVThis is a girls' bedroom.
p402
aVAnd the director listed the orphanage's most urgent needs
p403
aVas an industrial size washing machine and dryer,
p404
aVfour vacuum cleaners, two computers,
p405
aVa video projector, a copy machine,
p406
aVwinter shoes and a dentist's drill.
p407
aVThis photograph, which I took at the orphanage of one of the classrooms,
p408
aVshows a sign which I had translated when I got home.
p409
aVAnd it reads: "Those who do not know their past
p410
aVare not worthy of their future."
p411
aa(lp412
VThere are many more chapters in this project.
p413
aVThis is just an abridged rendering
p414
aVof over a thousand images.
p415
aVAnd this mass pile of images and stories
p416
aVforms an archive.
p417
aVAnd within this accumulation of images and texts,
p418
aVI'm struggling to find patterns
p419
aVand imagine that the narratives that surround the lives we lead
p420
aVare just as coded as blood itself.
p421
aVBut archives exist
p422
aVbecause there's something that can't necessarily be articulated.
p423
aVSomething is said in the gaps
p424
aVbetween all the information that's collected.
p425
aVAnd there's this relentless persistence
p426
aVof birth and death
p427
aVand an unending collection of stories in between.
p428
aVIt's almost machine-like
p429
aVthe way people are born and people die,
p430
aVand the stories keep coming and coming.
p431
aVAnd in this, I'm considering,
p432
aVis this actual accumulation
p433
aVleading to some sort of evolution,
p434
aVor are we on repeat
p435
aVover and over again?
