VWe are at a remarkable moment in time.
p4
aVWe face over the next two decades
p5
aVtwo fundamental transformations
p6
aVthat will determine whether the next 100 years
p7
aVis the best of centuries or the worst of centuries.
p8
aa(lp9
VLet me illustrate with an example.
p10
aVI first visited Beijing 25 years ago
p11
aVto teach at the People's University of China.
p12
aVChina was getting serious about market economics
p13
aVand about university education,
p14
aVso they decided to call in the foreign experts.
p15
aVLike most other people,
p16
aVI moved around Beijing by bicycle.
p17
aVApart from dodging the occasional vehicle,
p18
aVit was a safe and easy way to get around.
p19
aVCycling in Beijing now
p20
aVis a completely different prospect.
p21
aVThe roads are jammed by cars and trucks.
p22
aVThe air is dangerously polluted
p23
aVfrom the burning of coal and diesel.
p24
aVWhen I was there last in the spring,
p25
aVthere was an advisory for people of my age \u2014
p26
aVover 65 \u2014
p27
aVto stay indoors and not move much.
p28
aa(lp29
VHow did this come about?
p30
aVIt came from the way in which
p31
aVBeijing has grown as a city.
p32
aVIt's doubled over those 25 years, more than doubled,
p33
aVfrom 10 million to 20 million.
p34
aVIt's become a sprawling urban area
p35
aVdependent on dirty fuel, dirty energy,
p36
aVparticularly coal.
p37
aVChina burns half the world's coal each year,
p38
aVand that's why, it is a key reason why,
p39
aVit is the world's largest emitter
p40
aVof greenhouse gases.
p41
aVAt the same time, we have to recognize
p42
aVthat in that period China has grown remarkably.
p43
aVIt has become the world's second largest economy.
p44
aVHundreds of millions of people
p45
aVhave been lifted out of poverty.
p46
aVThat's really important.
p47
aVBut at the same time, the people of China
p48
aVare asking the question:
p49
aVWhat's the value of this growth
p50
aVif our cities are unlivable?
p51
aVThey've analyzed, diagnosed
p52
aVthat this is an unsustainable path of growth
p53
aVand development.
p54
aVChina's planning to scale back coal.
p55
aVIt's looking to build its cities in different ways.
p56
aa(lp57
VNow, the growth of China
p58
aVis part of a dramatic change, fundamental change,
p59
aVin the structure of the world economy.
p60
aVJust 25 years ago, the developing countries,
p61
aVthe poorer countries of the world,
p62
aVwere, notwithstanding being the vast majority of the people,
p63
aVthey accounted for only about a third
p64
aVof the world's output.
p65
aVNow it's more than half;
p66
aV25 years from now, it will probably be two thirds
p67
aVfrom the countries that we saw 25 years ago
p68
aVas developing.
p69
aVThat's a remarkable change.
p70
aVIt means that most countries around the world,
p71
aVrich or poor, are going to be facing
p72
aVthe two fundamental transformations
p73
aVthat I want to talk about and highlight.
p74
aa(lp75
VNow, the first of these transformations
p76
aVis the basic structural change
p77
aVof the economies and societies
p78
aVthat I've already begun to illustrate
p79
aVthrough the description of Beijing.
p80
aVFifty percent now in urban areas.
p81
aVThat's going to go to 70 percent in 2050.
p82
aVOver the next two decades, we'll see
p83
aVthe demand for energy rise by 40 percent,
p84
aVand the growth in the economy and in the population
p85
aVis putting increasing pressure on our land,
p86
aVon our water and on our forests.
p87
aa(lp88
VThis is profound structural change.
p89
aVIf we manage it in a negligent
p90
aVor a shortsighted way,
p91
aVwe will create waste, pollution, congestion,
p92
aVdestruction of land and forests.
p93
aVIf we think of those three areas that I have illustrated
p94
aVwith my numbers \u2014 cities, energy, land \u2014
p95
aVif we manage all that badly,
p96
aVthen the outlook for the lives and livelihoods
p97
aVof the people around the world
p98
aVwould be poor and damaged.
p99
aVAnd more than that,
p100
aVthe emissions of greenhouse gases would rise,
p101
aVwith immense risks to our climate.
p102
aVConcentrations of greenhouse gases
p103
aVin the atmosphere are already
p104
aVhigher than they've been for millions of years.
p105
aVIf we go on increasing those concentrations,
p106
aVwe risk temperatures over the next century or so
p107
aVthat we have not seen on this planet
p108
aVfor tens of millions of years.
p109
aVWe've been around as Homo sapiens \u2014
p110
aVthat's a rather generous definition, sapiens \u2014
p111
aVfor perhaps a quarter of a million years, a quarter of a million.
p112
aVWe risk temperatures we haven't seen
p113
aVfor tens of millions of years over a century.
p114
aVThat would transform the relationship
p115
aVbetween human beings and the planet.
p116
aVIt would lead to changing deserts,
p117
aVchanging rivers, changing patterns of hurricanes,
p118
aVchanging sea levels,
p119
aVhundreds of millions of people,
p120
aVperhaps billions of people who would have to move,
p121
aVand if we've learned anything from history,
p122
aVthat means severe and extended conflict.
p123
aa(lp124
VAnd we couldn't just turn it off.
p125
aVYou can't make a peace treaty with the planet.
p126
aVYou can't negotiate with the laws of physics.
p127
aVYou're in there. You're stuck.
p128
aVThose are the stakes we're playing for,
p129
aVand that's why we have to make this second transformation,
p130
aVthe climate transformation,
p131
aVand move to a low-carbon economy.
p132
aVNow, the first of these transformations
p133
aVis going to happen anyway.
p134
aVWe have to decide whether to do it well or badly,
p135
aVthe economic, or structural, transformation.
p136
aVBut the second of the transformations,
p137
aVthe climate transformations, we have to decide to do.
p138
aVThose two transformations face us
p139
aVin the next two decades.
p140
aVThe next two decades are decisive
p141
aVfor what we have to do.
p142
aVNow, the more I've thought about this,
p143
aVthe two transformations coming together,
p144
aVthe more I've come to realize
p145
aVthat this is an enormous opportunity.
p146
aVIt's an opportunity which we can use
p147
aVor it's an opportunity which we can lose.
p148
aVAnd let me explain through those three key areas
p149
aVthat I've identified: cities, energy and land.
p150
aVAnd let me start with cities.
p151
aVI've already described the problems of Beijing:
p152
aVpollution, congestion, waste and so on.
p153
aVSurely we recognize that in many of our cities
p154
aVaround the world.
p155
aa(lp156
VNow, with cities, like life but particularly cities,
p157
aVyou have to think ahead.
p158
aVThe cities that are going to be built \u2014
p159
aVand there are many, and many big ones \u2014
p160
aVwe have to think of how to design them
p161
aVin a compact way
p162
aVso we can save travel time  and we can save energy.
p163
aVThe cities that already are  there, well established,
p164
aVwe have to think about renewal and investment in them
p165
aVso that we can connect ourselves much better
p166
aVwithin those cities, and make it easier,
p167
aVencourage more people, to live closer to the center.
p168
aVWe've got examples building around the world
p169
aVof the kinds of ways in which we can do that.
p170
aVThe bus rapid transport system in Bogotá in Colombia
p171
aVis a very important case of how to move around
p172
aVsafely and quickly in a non-polluting way
p173
aVin a city: very frequent buses,
p174
aVstrongly protected routes, the same service, really,
p175
aVas an underground railway system,
p176
aVbut much, much cheaper
p177
aVand can be done much more quickly,
p178
aVa brilliant idea in many more cities
p179
aVaround the world that's developing.
p180
aa(lp181
VNow, some things in cities do take time.
p182
aVSome things in cities can happen much more quickly.
p183
aVTake my hometown, London.
p184
aVIn 1952, smog in London killed 4,000 people
p185
aVand badly damaged the lives of many, many more.
p186
aVAnd it happened all the time.
p187
aVFor those of you live outside London in the U.K.
p188
aVwill remember it used to be called The Smoke.
p189
aVThat's the way London was.
p190
aVBy regulating coal, within a few years
p191
aVthe problems of smog were rapidly reduced.
p192
aVI remember the smogs well.
p193
aVWhen the visibility dropped to [less] than
p194
aVa few meters,
p195
aVthey stopped the buses and I had to walk.
p196
aVThis was the 1950s.
p197
aVI had to walk home three miles from school.
p198
aVAgain, breathing was a hazardous activity.
p199
aVBut it was changed. It was changed by a decision.
p200
aVGood decisions can bring good results,
p201
aVstriking results, quickly.
p202
aa(lp203
VWe've seen more: In London, we've introduced the congestion charge,
p204
aVactually quite quickly and effectively,
p205
aVand we've seen great improvements
p206
aVin the bus system, and cleaned up the bus system.
p207
aVYou can see that the two transformations I've described,
p208
aVthe structural and the climate,
p209
aVcome very much together.
p210
aVBut we have to invest. We have to invest in our cities,
p211
aVand we have to invest wisely, and if we do,
p212
aVwe'll see cleaner cities, quieter cities, safer cities,
p213
aVmore attractive cities, more productive cities,
p214
aVand stronger community in those cities \u2014
p215
aVpublic transport, recycling, reusing,
p216
aVall sorts of things that bring communities together.
p217
aVWe can do that, but we have to think,
p218
aVwe have to invest, we have to plan.
p219
aa(lp220
VLet me turn to energy.
p221
aVNow, energy over the last 25 years
p222
aVhas increased by about 50 percent.
p223
aVEighty percent of that comes from fossil fuels.
p224
aVOver the next 20 years,
p225
aVperhaps it will increase by another 40 percent or so.
p226
aVWe have to invest strongly in energy,
p227
aVwe have to use it much more efficiently,
p228
aVand we have to make it clean.
p229
aVWe can see how to do that.
p230
aVTake the example of California.
p231
aVIt would be in the top 10 countries in the world
p232
aVif it was independent.
p233
aVI don't want to start any \u2014
p234
aV(Laughter)
p235
aVCalifornia's a big place.
p236
aV(Laughter)
p237
aVIn the next five or six years,
p238
aVthey will likely move from
p239
aVaround 20 percent in renewables \u2014
p240
aVwind, solar and so on \u2014
p241
aVto over 33 percent,
p242
aVand that would bring California back
p243
aVto greenhouse gas emissions in 2020
p244
aVto where they were in 1990,
p245
aVa period when the economy in California
p246
aVwould more or less have doubled.
p247
aVThat's a striking achievement.
p248
aVIt shows what can be done.
p249
aVNot just California \u2014 the  incoming government of India
p250
aVis planning to get solar technology
p251
aVto light up the homes
p252
aVof 400 million people
p253
aVwho don't have electricity in India.
p254
aVThey've set themselves a target of five years.
p255
aVI think they've got a good chance of doing that.
p256
aVWe'll see, but what you're seeing now
p257
aVis people moving much more quickly.
p258
aVFour hundred million, more than the population
p259
aVof the United States.
p260
aVThose are the kinds of ambitions now
p261
aVpeople are setting themselves
p262
aVin terms of rapidity of change.
p263
aVAgain, you can see
p264
aVgood decisions can bring quick results,
p265
aVand those two transformations, the economy and the structure
p266
aVand the climate and the low carbon,
p267
aVare intimately intertwined.
p268
aVDo the first one well, the structural,
p269
aVthe second one on the climate
p270
aVbecomes much easier.
p271
aa(lp272
VLook at land,
p273
aVland and particularly forests.
p274
aVForests are the hosts to valuable
p275
aVplant and animal species.
p276
aVThey hold water in the soil
p277
aVand they take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere,
p278
aVfundamental to the tackling of climate change.
p279
aVBut we're losing our forests.
p280
aVIn the last decade, we've lost a forest area
p281
aVthe size of Portugal,
p282
aVand much more has been degraded.
p283
aVBut we're already seeing
p284
aVthat we can do so much about that.
p285
aVWe can recognize the problem, but we can also
p286
aVunderstand how to tackle it.
p287
aVIn Brazil, the rate of deforestation
p288
aVhas been reduced by 70 percent
p289
aVover the last 10 years.
p290
aVHow? By involving local communities,
p291
aVinvesting in their agriculture and their economies,
p292
aVby monitoring more carefully,
p293
aVby enforcing the law more strictly.
p294
aa(lp295
VAnd it's not just stopping deforestation.
p296
aVThat's of course of first and fundamental importance,
p297
aVbut it's also regrading degraded land,
p298
aVregenerating, rehabilitating degraded land.
p299
aVI first went to Ethiopia in 1967.
p300
aVIt was desperately poor. In the following years,
p301
aVit suffered devastating famines
p302
aVand profoundly destructive social conflict.
p303
aVOver the last few years, actually more than a few,
p304
aVEthiopia has been growing much more rapidly.
p305
aVIt has ambitions to be a middle-income country
p306
aV15 years from now
p307
aVand to be carbon neutral.
p308
aVAgain, I think it's a strong ambition
p309
aVbut it is a plausible one.
p310
aVYou're seeing that commitment there.
p311
aVYou're seeing what can be done.
p312
aVEthiopia is investing in clean energy.
p313
aVIt's working in the rehabilitation of land.
p314
aVIn Humbo, in southwest Ethiopia,
p315
aVa wonderful project
p316
aVto plant trees on degraded land
p317
aVand work with local communities
p318
aVon sustainable forest management
p319
aVhas led to big increases in living standards.
p320
aa(lp321
VSo we can see, from Beijing to London,
p322
aVfrom California to India,
p323
aVfrom Brazil to Ethiopia,
p324
aVwe do understand
p325
aVhow to manage those two transformations,
p326
aVthe structural and the climate.
p327
aVWe do understand how to manage those well.
p328
aVAnd technology is changing very rapidly.
p329
aVI don't have to list all those things
p330
aVto an audience like this,
p331
aVbut you can see the electric cars,
p332
aVyou can see the batteries using new materials.
p333
aVYou can see that we can manage remotely now
p334
aVour household appliances on our mobile phones when we're away.
p335
aVYou can see better insulation.
p336
aVAnd there's much more coming.
p337
aa(lp338
VBut, and it's a big but,
p339
aVthe world as a whole
p340
aVis moving far too slowly.
p341
aVWe're not cutting emissions in the way we should.
p342
aVWe're not managing those structural transformations
p343
aVas we can.
p344
aVThe depth of understanding of the immense risks of climate change
p345
aVare not there yet.
p346
aVThe depth of understanding
p347
aVof the attractiveness of what we can do
p348
aVis not there yet.
p349
aVWe need political pressure to build.
p350
aVWe need leaders to step up.
p351
aVWe can have better growth,
p352
aVbetter climate, a better world.
p353
aVWe can make,
p354
aVby managing those two transformations well,
p355
aVthe next 100 years the best of centuries.
p356
aVIf we make a mess of it,
p357
aVwe, you and me, if we make a mess of it,
p358
aVif we don't manage those transformations properly,
p359
aVit will be, the next 100 years
p360
aVwill be the worst of centuries.
p361
aVThat's the major conclusion
p362
aVof the report on the economy and climate
p363
aVchaired by ex-President Felipe Calderón of Mexico,
p364
aVand I co-chaired that with him,
p365
aVand we handed that report yesterday
p366
aVhere in New York, in the United Nations Building
p367
aVto the Secretary-General of the U.N.,
p368
aVBan Ki-moon.
p369
aVWe know that we can do this.
p370
aa(lp371
VNow, two weeks ago,
p372
aVI became a grandfather for the fourth time.
p373
aVOur daughter \u2014
p374
aV(Baby cries) (Laughter) (Applause) \u2014
p375
aVOur daughter gave birth to Rosa here in New York
p376
aVtwo weeks ago. Here are Helen and Rosa.
p377
aV(Applause)
p378
aVTwo weeks old.
p379
aVAre we going to look our grandchildren in the eye
p380
aVand tell them that we understood the issues,
p381
aVthat we recognized the dangers and the opportunities,
p382
aVand still we failed to act?
p383
aVSurely not. Let's make the next 100 years
