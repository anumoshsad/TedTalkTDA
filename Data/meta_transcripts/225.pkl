VBy day, I'm a venture capitalist.
p4
aVOn weekends, I love rockets.
p5
aVI love photography, I love rockets.
p6
aVI'm going to talk about a hobby that can scale
p7
aVand show you photos I've taken over the years
p8
aVwith kids like these, that hopefully will grow up to love rocketry
p9
aVand eventually become a Richard Branson or Diamandis.
p10
aVMy son designed a rocket that became stable, a golf ball rocket.
p11
aVI thought it was quite an interesting experiment
p12
aVin the principles of rocket science.
p13
aVAnd it flies straight as an arrow.
p14
aa(lp15
VBaking soda and vinegar.
p16
aVNight shots are beautiful,
p17
aVpiercing the Big Dipper and the Milky Way.
p18
aV2-stage rockets with video cameras on them,
p19
aVonboard computers logging their flights, rocket gliders that fly back to Earth.
p20
aVI use RockSim to simulate flights before they go
p21
aVto see if they'll break supersonic,
p22
aVthen fly them with onboard computers to verify performance.
p23
aa(lp24
VTo launch the big stuff, you go to the middle of nowhere:
p25
aVBlack Rock Desert, where dangerous things happen.
p26
aVThe boys and the rockets get bigger.
p27
aVThey use motors used on cruise-missile boosters.
p28
aVThey rumble the belly and leave even photographers in awe,
p29
aVwatching the spectacle.
p30
aVThese rockets use experimental motors like nitrous oxide.
p31
aVThey use solid propellant most frequently.
p32
aVIt's a strange kind of love.
p33
aa(lp34
VRocketMavericks.com with my photos, if you want to learn about this,
p35
aVparticipate, be a spectator.
p36
aVWe had to call it Rocket Mavericks.
p37
aVThis one was great, went to 100,000 feet \u2014 but didn't quite.
p38
aVActually, it went 11 feet into solid clay and became a bunker-buster.
p39
aVIt had to be dug out.
p40
aa(lp41
VRockets often spiral out of control if you put too much propellant in them.
p42
aVHere was a drag race.
p43
aVAt night you can see what happened in a second;
p44
aVin daytime, we call them land sharks.
p45
aVSometimes they just explode before your eyes or come down supersonic.
p46
aa(lp47
V(Laughter)
p48
aa(lp49
VTo take this shot, I did what I often do, which is go way beyond the pads,
p50
aVwhere none of the spectators are.
p51
aVAnd if we can run the video, I'll show you what it took
p52
aVto get this DreamWorks shot.
p53
aa(lp54
V(Video) Voices: Woo-hoo! Yeah. Nice.
p55
aa(lp56
VSteve Jurvetson: They realize the computer failed, they're yelling "Deploy!"
p57
aV(Video) Man: Oh, shit.
p58
aa(lp59
VSJ: This is when they realize everything's gone haywire.
p60
aa(lp61
V(Video) Man: It's going ballistic.
p62
aa(lp63
VSJ: I'll just be quiet.
p64
aa(lp65
V(Video) Woman: No!
p66
aVCome on, come on, come on.
p67
aa(lp68
VSJ: And that's me over there, taking photos the whole way.
p69
aVThings often go wrong.
p70
aVSome people watch this because of a NASCAR-like fascination
p71
aVwith things bumping and grinding.
p72
aVBurning the parachute as it fell. That was last weekend.
p73
aVThis guy went up, went supersonic, ripped the fin can off.
p74
aVThe art sale in the sky.
p75
aVA burning metal hunk coming back.
p76
aVThese things dropped down from above all through the weekend
p77
aVof rocket launch after rocket launch.
p78
aVIt's a cadence you can't quite imagine.
p79
aVI try to capture the mishaps; it's a challenge in photography
p80
aVwhen these things take place in a fraction of a second.
p81
aa(lp82
VWhy do it? For things like this:
p83
aVGene from Alabama drives out there
p84
aVwith this rocket he's built with X-ray sensors, video cameras,
p85
aVfestooned with electronics.
p86
aVHe succeeds getting to 100,000 feet,
p87
aVleaving the atmosphere, seeing a thin blue line of space.
p88
aa(lp89
VIt is this breathtaking image \u2014 success, of course \u2014 that motivates us
p90
aVand motivates kids to follow and understand rocket science,
p91
aVunderstand the importance of physics and math
p92
aVand, in many ways, to have that awe at exploration
p93
aVof the frontiers of the unknown.
p94
aa(lp95
VThank you.
