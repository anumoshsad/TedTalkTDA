VI'm five years old, and I am very proud.
p4
aVMy father has just built the best outhouse
p5
aVin our little village in Ukraine.
p6
aVInside, it's a smelly, gaping hole in the ground,
p7
aVbut outside, it's pearly white formica
p8
aVand it literally gleams in the sun.
p9
aVThis makes me feel so proud, so important,
p10
aVthat I appoint myself the leader of my little group of friends
p11
aVand I devise missions for us.
p12
aVSo we prowl from house to house
p13
aVlooking for flies captured in spider webs
p14
aVand we set them free.
p15
aVFour years earlier, when I was one,
p16
aVafter the Chernobyl accident,
p17
aVthe rain came down black,
p18
aVand my sister's hair fell out in clumps,
p19
aVand I spent nine months in the hospital.
p20
aVThere were no visitors allowed,
p21
aVso my mother bribed a hospital worker.
p22
aVShe acquired a nurse's uniform,
p23
aVand she snuck in every night to sit by my side.
p24
aVFive years later, an unexpected silver lining.
p25
aVThanks to Chernobyl, we get asylum in the U.S.
p26
aVI am six years old, and I don't cry when we leave home
p27
aVand we come to America,
p28
aVbecause I expect it to be a place filled with rare
p29
aVand wonderful things like bananas and chocolate
p30
aVand Bazooka bubble gum,
p31
aVBazooka bubble gum with the little cartoon wrappers inside,
p32
aVBazooka that we'd get once a year in Ukraine
p33
aVand we'd have to chew one piece for an entire week.
p34
aVSo the first day we get to New York,
p35
aVmy grandmother and I find a penny
p36
aVin the floor of the homeless shelter that my family's staying in.
p37
aVOnly, we don't know that it's a homeless shelter.
p38
aVWe think that it's a hotel, a hotel with lots of rats.
p39
aVSo we find this penny kind of fossilized in the floor,
p40
aVand we think that a very wealthy man must have left it there
p41
aVbecause regular people don't just lose money.
p42
aVAnd I hold this penny in the palm of my hand,
p43
aVand it's sticky and rusty,
p44
aVbut it feels like I'm holding a fortune.
p45
aVI decide that I'm going to get my very own piece
p46
aVof Bazooka bubble gum.
p47
aVAnd in that moment, I feel like a millionaire.
p48
aVAbout a year later, I get to feel that way again
p49
aVwhen we find a bag full of stuffed animals in the trash,
p50
aVand suddenly I have more toys
p51
aVthan I've ever had in my whole life.
p52
aVAnd again, I get that feeling when we get a knock
p53
aVon the door of our apartment in Brooklyn,
p54
aVand my sister and I find a deliveryman
p55
aVwith a box of pizza that we didn't order.
p56
aVSo we take the pizza, our very first pizza,
p57
aVand we devour slice after slice
p58
aVas the deliveryman stands there and stares at us from the doorway.
p59
aVAnd he tells us to pay, but we don't speak English.
p60
aVMy mother comes out, and he asks her for money,
p61
aVbut she doesn't have enough.
p62
aVShe walks 50 blocks to and from work every day
p63
aVjust to avoid spending money on bus fare.
p64
aVThen our neighbor pops her head in,
p65
aVand she turns red with rage when she realizes
p66
aVthat those immigrants from downstairs
p67
aVhave somehow gotten their hands on her pizza.
p68
aVEveryone's upset.
p69
aVBut the pizza is delicious.
p70
aVIt doesn't hit me until years later just how little we had.
p71
aVOn our 10 year anniversary of being in the U.S.,
p72
aVwe decided to celebrate by reserving a room
p73
aVat the hotel that we first stayed in when we got to the U.S.
p74
aVThe man at the front desk laughs, and he says,
p75
aV"You can't reserve a room here. This is a homeless shelter."
p76
aVAnd we were shocked.
p77
aVMy husband Brian was also homeless as a kid.
p78
aVHis family lost everything, and at age 11,
p79
aVhe had to live in motels with his dad,
p80
aVmotels that would round up all of their food
p81
aVand keep it hostage until they were able to pay the bill.
p82
aVAnd one time, when he finally got his box
p83
aVof Frosted Flakes back, it was crawling with roaches.
p84
aVBut he did have one thing.
p85
aVHe had this shoebox that he carried with him everywhere
p86
aVcontaining nine comic books,
p87
aVtwo G.I. Joes painted to look like Spider-Man
p88
aVand five Gobots. And this was his treasure.
p89
aVThis was his own assembly of heroes
p90
aVthat kept him from drugs and gangs
p91
aVand from giving up on his dreams.
p92
aVI'm going to tell you about one more
p93
aVformerly homeless member of our family.
p94
aVThis is Scarlett.
p95
aVOnce upon a time, Scarlet was used as bait in dog fights.
p96
aVShe was tied up and thrown into the ring
p97
aVfor other dogs to attack so they'd get more aggressive before the fight.
p98
aVAnd now, these days, she eats organic food
p99
aVand she sleeps on an orthopedic bed with her name on it,
p100
aVbut when we pour water for her in her bowl,
p101
aVshe still looks up and she wags her tail in gratitude.
p102
aVSometimes Brian and I walk through the park with Scarlett,
p103
aVand she rolls through the grass,
p104
aVand we just look at her
p105
aVand then we look at each other
p106
aVand we feel gratitude.
p107
aVWe forget about all of our new middle-class frustrations
p108
aVand disappointments,
p109
aVand we feel like millionaires.
p110
aVThank you.
