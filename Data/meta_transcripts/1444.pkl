(lp2
(lp3
VSo what I want to try to do is tell a quick story
p4
aVabout a 404 page and a lesson that was learned as a result of it.
p5
aVBut to start it probably helps to have an understanding
p6
aVof what a 404 page actually is.
p7
aa(lp8
VThe 404 page is that.
p9
aVIt's that broken experience on the Web.
p10
aVIt's effectively the default page
p11
aVwhen you ask a website for something and it can't find it.
p12
aVAnd it serves you the 404 page.
p13
aVIt's inherently a feeling of being broken when you go through it.
p14
aVAnd I just want you to think a little bit about, remember for yourself,
p15
aVit's annoying when you hit this thing.
p16
aVBecause it's the feeling of a broken relationship.
p17
aa(lp18
VAnd that's where it's actually also interesting to think about,
p19
aVwhere does 404 come from?
p20
aVIt's from a family of errors actually \u2014
p21
aVa whole set of relationship errors,
p22
aVwhich, when I started digging into them,
p23
aVit looks almost like a checklist for a sex therapist or a couples counselor.
p24
aVYou sort of get down there to the bottom and things get really dicey.
p25
aa(lp26
V(Laughter)
p27
aa(lp28
VYes.
p29
aa(lp30
VBut these things are everywhere.
p31
aVThey're on sites big, they're on sites small.
p32
aVThis is a global experience.
p33
aa(lp34
VWhat a 404 page tells you
p35
aVis that you fell through the cracks.
p36
aVAnd that's not a good experience
p37
aVwhen you're used to experiences like this.
p38
aVYou can get on your Kinect
p39
aVand you can have unicorns dancing
p40
aVand rainbows spraying out of your mobile phone.
p41
aVA 404 page is not what you're looking for.
p42
aVYou get that, and it's like a slap in the face.
p43
aVTrying to think about how a 404 felt,
p44
aVand it would be like if you went to Starbucks
p45
aVand there's the guy behind the counter
p46
aVand you're over there and there's no skim milk.
p47
aVAnd you say, "Hey, could you bring the skim milk?"
p48
aVAnd they walk out from behind the counter and they've got no pants on.
p49
aVAnd you're like, "Oh, I didn't want to see that."
p50
aVThat's the 404 feeling.
p51
aa(lp52
V(Laughter)
p53
aa(lp54
VI mean, I've heard about that.
p55
aa(lp56
VSo where this comes into play and why this is important
p57
aVis I head up a technology incubator,
p58
aVand we had eight startups sitting around there.
p59
aVAnd those startups are focused on what they are, not what they're not,
p60
aVuntil one day Athletepath,
p61
aVwhich is a website that focuses on services for extreme athletes,
p62
aVfound this video.
p63
aa(lp64
V(Video) Guy: Joey!
p65
aa(lp66
VCrowd: Whoa!
p67
aa(lp68
VRenny Gleeson: You just ... no, he's not okay.
p69
aVThey took that video and they embedded it in their 404 page
p70
aVand it was like a light bulb went off for everybody in the place.
p71
aVBecause finally there was a page
p72
aVthat actually felt like what it felt like to hit a 404.
p73
aa(lp74
V(Laughter)
p75
aa(lp76
V(Applause)
p77
aa(lp78
VSo this turned into a contest.
p79
aVDailypath that offers inspiration
p80
aVput inspiration on their 404 page.
p81
aVStayhound, which helps you find pet sitters through your social network,
p82
aVcommiserated with your pet.
p83
aVEach one of them found this.
p84
aVIt turned into a 24-hour contest.
p85
aVAt 4:04 the next day, we gave out $404 in cash.
p86
aVAnd what they learned
p87
aVwas that those little things, done right, actually matter,
p88
aVand that well-designed moments can build brands.
p89
aVSo you take a look out in the real world,
p90
aVand the fun thing is you can actually hack these yourself.
p91
aVYou can type in an URL and put in a 404 and these will pop.
p92
aVThis is one that commiserates with you.
p93
aVThis is one that blames you.
p94
aVThis is one that I loved.
p95
aVThis is an error page,
p96
aVbut what if this error page was also an opportunity?
p97
aa(lp98
VSo it was a moment in time
p99
aVwhere all of these startups had to sit and think
p100
aVand got really excited about what they could be.
p101
aVBecause back to the whole relationship issue,
p102
aVwhat they figured out through this exercise
p103
aVwas that a simple mistake can tell me what you're not,
p104
aVor it can remind me of why I should love you.
p105
aa(lp106
VThank you.
