VHi. I'm going to ask you to raise your arms and wave back,
p4
aVjust the way I am \u2014 kind of a royal wave.
p5
aVYou can mimic what you can see.
p6
aVYou can program the hundreds of muscles in your arm.
p7
aVSoon, you'll be able to look inside your brain and program,
p8
aVcontrol the hundreds of brain areas that you see there.
p9
aVI'm going to tell you about that technology.
p10
aa(lp11
VPeople have wanted to look inside the human mind,
p12
aVthe human brain, for thousands of years.
p13
aVWell, coming out of the research labs just now, for our generation, is the possibility to do that.
p14
aVPeople envision this as being very difficult.
p15
aVYou had to take a spaceship, shrink it down, inject it into the bloodstream.
p16
aVIt was terribly dangerous. (Laughter)
p17
aVYou could be attacked by white blood cells in the arteries.
p18
aVBut now, we have a real technology to do this.
p19
aa(lp20
VWe're going to fly into my colleague Peter's brain.
p21
aVWe're going to do it non-invasively using MRI.
p22
aVWe don't have to inject anything. We don't need radiation.
p23
aVWe will be able to fly into the anatomy of Peter's brain \u2014 literally, fly into his body \u2014
p24
aVbut more importantly, we can look into his mind.
p25
aVWhen Peter moves his arm, that yellow spot you see there
p26
aVis the interface to the functioning of Peter's mind taking place.
p27
aVNow you've seen before that with electrodes you can control robotic arms,
p28
aVthat brain imaging and scanners can show you the insides of brains.
p29
aVWhat's new is that that process has typically taken days or months of analysis.
p30
aVWe've collapsed that through technology to milliseconds,
p31
aVand that allows us to let Peter to look at his brain in real time as he's inside the scanner.
p32
aVHe can look at these 65,000 points of activation per second.
p33
aVIf he can see this pattern in his own brain, he can learn how to control it.
p34
aa(lp35
VThere have been three ways to try to impact the brain:
p36
aVthe therapist's couch, pills and the knife.
p37
aVThis is a fourth alternative that you are soon going to have.
p38
aVWe all know that as we form thoughts, they form deep channels in our minds and in our brains.
p39
aVChronic pain is an example. If you burn yourself, you pull your hand away.
p40
aVBut if you're still in pain in six months' or six years' time,
p41
aVit's because these circuits are producing pain that's no longer helping you.
p42
aVIf we can look at the activation in the brain that's producing the pain,
p43
aVwe can form 3D models and watch in real time the brain process information,
p44
aVand then we can select the areas that produce the pain.
p45
aVSo put your arms back up and flex your bicep.
p46
aa(lp47
VNow imagine that you will soon be able to look inside your brain
p48
aVand select brain areas to do that same thing.
p49
aVWhat you're seeing here is, we've selected the pathways in the brain of a chronic pain patient.
p50
aVThis may shock you, but we're literally reading this person's brain in real time.
p51
aVThey're watching their own brain activation,
p52
aVand they're controlling the pathway that produces their pain.
p53
aVThey're learning to flex this system that releases their own endogenous opiates.
p54
aVAs they do it, in the upper left is a display
p55
aVthat's yoked to their brain activation of their own pain being controlled.
p56
aVWhen they control their brain, they can control their pain.
p57
aVThis is an investigational technology,
p58
aVbut, in clinical trials, we're seeing a 44 to 64 percent decrease in chronic pain patients.
p59
aa(lp60
VThis is not "The Matrix." You can only do this to yourself. You take control.
p61
aVI've seen inside my brain. You will too, soon.
p62
aVWhen you do, what do you want to control?
p63
aVYou will be able to look at all the aspects that make you yourself, all your experiences.
p64
aVThese are some of the areas we're working on today that I don't have time to go into in detail.
p65
aVBut I want to leave with you the big question.
p66
aVWe are the first generation that's going to be able to enter into,
p67
aVusing this technology, the human mind and brain.
p68
aVWhere will we take it?
