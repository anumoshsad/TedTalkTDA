VThe Internet, the Web as we know it,
p4
aVthe kind of Web \u2014 the things we're all talking about \u2014
p5
aVis already less than 5,000 days old.
p6
aVSo all of the things that we've seen come about,
p7
aVstarting, say, with satellite images of the whole Earth,
p8
aVwhich we couldn't even imagine happening before,
p9
aVall these things rolling into our lives,
p10
aVjust this abundance of things that are right before us,
p11
aVsitting in front of our laptop, or our desktop.
p12
aVThis kind of cornucopia of stuff
p13
aVjust coming and never ending is amazing, and we're not amazed.
p14
aVIt's really amazing that all this stuff is here.
p15
aV(Laughter)
p16
aVIt's in 5,000 days, all this stuff has come.
p17
aVAnd I know that 10 years ago,
p18
aVif I had told you that this was all coming,
p19
aVyou would have said that that's impossible.
p20
aVThere's simply no economic model that that would be possible.
p21
aVAnd if I told you it was all coming for free,
p22
aVyou would say, this is simply \u2014 you're dreaming.
p23
aVYou're a Californian utopian. You're a wild-eyed optimist.
p24
aVAnd yet it's here.
p25
aa(lp26
VThe other thing that we know about it was that 10 years ago,
p27
aVas I looked at what even Wired was talking about,
p28
aVwe thought it was going to be TV, but better.
p29
aVThat was the model. That was what everybody was suggesting
p30
aVwas going to be coming.
p31
aVAnd it turns out that that's not what it was.
p32
aVFirst of all, it was impossible, and it's not what it was.
p33
aVAnd so one of the things that I think we're learning \u2014
p34
aVif you think about, like, Wikipedia,
p35
aVit's something that was simply impossible.
p36
aVIt's impossible in theory, but possible in practice.
p37
aVAnd if you take all these things that are impossible,
p38
aVI think one of the things that we're learning from this era,
p39
aVfrom this last decade, is that we have to get good at believing in the impossible,
p40
aVbecause we're unprepared for it.
p41
aa(lp42
VSo, I'm curious about what's going to happen in the next 5,000 days.
p43
aVBut if that's happened in the last 5,000 days,
p44
aVwhat's going to happen in the next 5,000 days?
p45
aVSo, I have a kind of a simple story,
p46
aVand it suggests that what we want to think about is this thing that we're making,
p47
aVthis thing that has happened in 5,000 days \u2014
p48
aVthat's all these computers, all these handhelds,
p49
aVall these cell phones, all these laptops, all these servers \u2014
p50
aVbasically what we're getting out of all these connections
p51
aVis we're getting one machine.
p52
aVIf there is only one machine, and our little handhelds and devices
p53
aVare actually just little windows into those machines,
p54
aVbut that we're basically constructing a single, global machine.
p55
aa(lp56
VAnd so I began to think about that.
p57
aVAnd it turned out that this machine happens to be
p58
aVthe most reliable machine that we've ever made.
p59
aVIt has not crashed; it's running uninterrupted.
p60
aVAnd there's almost no other machine that we've ever made
p61
aVthat runs the number of hours, the number of days.
p62
aV5,000 days without interruption \u2014 that's just unbelievable.
p63
aVAnd of course, the Internet is longer than just 5,000 days;
p64
aVthe Web is only 5,000 days.
p65
aVSo, I was trying to basically make measurements.
p66
aVWhat are the dimensions of this machine?
p67
aVAnd I started off by calculating how many billions of clicks there are
p68
aVall around the globe on all the computers.
p69
aVAnd there is a 100 billion clicks per day.
p70
aVAnd there's 55 trillion links between all the Web pages of the world.
p71
aa(lp72
VAnd so I began thinking more about other kinds of dimensions,
p73
aVand I made a quick list. Was it Chris Jordan, the photographer,
p74
aVtalking about numbers being so large that they're meaningless?
p75
aVWell, here's a list of them. They're hard to tell,
p76
aVbut there's one billion PC chips on the Internet,
p77
aVif you count all the chips in all the computers on the Internet.
p78
aVThere's two million emails per second.
p79
aVSo it's a very big number.
p80
aVIt's just a huge machine,
p81
aVand it uses five percent of the global electricity on the planet.
p82
aVSo here's the specifications,
p83
aVjust as if you were to make up a spec sheet for it:
p84
aV170 quadrillion transistors, 55 trillion links,
p85
aVemails running at two megahertz itself,
p86
aV31 kilohertz text messaging,
p87
aV246 exabyte storage. That's a big disk.
p88
aVThat's a lot of storage, memory. Nine exabyte RAM.
p89
aVAnd the total traffic on this
p90
aVis running at seven terabytes per second.
p91
aVBrewster was saying the Library of Congress is about twenty terabytes.
p92
aVSo every second, half of the Library of Congress
p93
aVis swooshing around in this machine. It's a big machine.
p94
aa(lp95
VSo I did something else. I figured out 100 billion clicks per day,
p96
aV55 trillion links is almost the same
p97
aVas the number of synapses in your brain.
p98
aVA quadrillion transistors is almost the same
p99
aVas the number of neurons in your brain.
p100
aVSo to a first approximation, we have these things \u2014
p101
aVtwenty petahertz synapse firings.
p102
aVOf course, the memory is really huge.
p103
aVBut to a first approximation, the size of this machine is the size \u2014
p104
aVand its complexity, kind of \u2014 to your brain.
p105
aVBecause in fact, that's how your brain works \u2014 in kind of the same way that the Web works.
p106
aVHowever, your brain isn't doubling every two years.
p107
aVSo if we say this machine right now that we've made
p108
aVis about one HB, one human brain,
p109
aVif we look at the rate that this is increasing,
p110
aV30 years from now, there'll be six billion HBs.
p111
aVSo by the year 2040, the total processing of this machine
p112
aVwill exceed a total processing power of humanity,
p113
aa(lp114
Vin raw bits and stuff. And this is, I think, where
p115
aVRay Kurzweil and others get this little chart saying that we're going to cross.
p116
aVSo, what about that? Well, here's a couple of things.
p117
aVI have three kind of general things
p118
aVI would like to say, three consequences of this.
p119
aVFirst, that basically what this machine is doing is embodying.
p120
aVWe're giving it a body. And that's what we're going to do
p121
aVin the next 5,000 days \u2014 we're going to give this machine a body.
p122
aVAnd the second thing is, we're going to restructure its architecture.
p123
aVAnd thirdly, we're going to become completely codependent upon it.
p124
aa(lp125
VSo let me go through those three things.
p126
aVFirst of all, we have all these things in our hands.
p127
aVWe think they're all separate devices,
p128
aVbut in fact, every screen in the world
p129
aVis looking into the one machine.
p130
aVThese are all basically portals into that one machine.
p131
aVThe second thing is that \u2014 some people call this the cloud,
p132
aVand you're kind of touching the cloud with this.
p133
aVAnd so in some ways, all you really need is a cloudbook.
p134
aVAnd the cloudbook doesn't have any storage.
p135
aVIt's wireless. It's always connected.
p136
aVThere's many things about it. It becomes very simple,
p137
aVand basically what you're doing is you're just touching the machine,
p138
aVyou're touching the cloud and you're going to compute that way.
p139
aVSo the machine is computing.
p140
aa(lp141
VAnd in some ways, it's sort of back
p142
aVto the kind of old idea of centralized computing.
p143
aVBut everything, all the cameras, and the microphones,
p144
aVand the sensors in cars
p145
aVand everything is connected to this machine.
p146
aVAnd everything will go through the Web.
p147
aVAnd we're seeing that already with, say, phones.
p148
aVRight now, phones don't go through the Web,
p149
aVbut they are beginning to, and they will.
p150
aVAnd if you imagine what, say, just as an example, what Google Labs has
p151
aVin terms of experiments with Google Docs, Google Spreadsheets, blah, blah, blah \u2014
p152
aVall these things are going to become Web based.
p153
aVThey're going through the machine.
p154
aVAnd I am suggesting that every bit will be owned by the Web.
p155
aVRight now, it's not. If you do spreadsheets and things at work,
p156
aVa Word document, they aren't on the Web,
p157
aVbut they are going to be. They're going to be part of this machine.
p158
aVThey're going to speak the Web language.
p159
aVThey're going to talk to the machine.
p160
aVThe Web, in some sense, is kind of like a black hole
p161
aVthat's sucking up everything into it.
p162
aVAnd so every thing will be part of the Web.
p163
aVSo every item, every artifact that we make, will have embedded in it
p164
aVsome little sliver of Web-ness and connection,
p165
aVand it will be part of this machine,
p166
aVso that our environment \u2014 kind of in that ubiquitous computing sense \u2014
p167
aVour environment becomes the Web. Everything is connected.
p168
aa(lp169
VNow, with RFIDs and other things \u2014 whatever technology it is,
p170
aVit doesn't really matter. The point is that everything
p171
aVwill have embedded in it some sensor connecting it to the machine,
p172
aVand so we have, basically, an Internet of things.
p173
aVSo you begin to think of a shoe as a chip with heels,
p174
aVand a car as a chip with wheels,
p175
aVbecause basically most of the cost of manufacturing cars
p176
aVis the embedded intelligence and electronics in it, and not the materials.
p177
aVA lot of people think about the new economy
p178
aVas something that was going to be a disembodied,
p179
aValternative, virtual existence,
p180
aVand that we would have the old economy of atoms.
p181
aVBut in fact, what the new economy really is
p182
aVis the marriage of those two, where we embed the information,
p183
aVand the digital nature of things into the material world.
p184
aVThat's what we're looking forward to. That is where we're going \u2014
p185
aVthis union, this convergence of the atomic and the digital.
p186
aa(lp187
VAnd so one of the consequences of that, I believe,
p188
aVis that where we have this sort of spectrum of media right now \u2014
p189
aVTV, film, video \u2014 that basically becomes one media platform.
p190
aVAnd while there's many differences in some senses,
p191
aVthey will share more and more in common with each other.
p192
aVSo that the laws of media, such as the fact that copies have no value,
p193
aVthe value's in the uncopiable things,
p194
aVthe immediacy, the authentication, the personalization.
p195
aVThe media wants to be liquid.
p196
aVThe reason why things are free is so that you can manipulate them,
p197
aVnot so that they are "free" as in "beer," but "free" as in "freedom."
p198
aVAnd the network effects rule,
p199
aVmeaning that the more you have, the more you get.
p200
aVThe first fax machine \u2014 the person who bought the first fax machine
p201
aVwas an idiot, because there was nobody to fax to.
p202
aVBut here she became an evangelist, recruiting others
p203
aVto get the fax machines because it made their purchase more valuable.
p204
aVThose are the effects that we're going to see.
p205
aVAttention is the currency.
p206
aa(lp207
VSo those laws are going to kind of spread throughout all media.
p208
aVAnd the other thing about this embodiment
p209
aVis that there's kind of what I call the McLuhan reversal.
p210
aVMcLuhan was saying, "Machines are the extensions of the human senses."
p211
aVAnd I'm saying, "Humans are now going to be
p212
aVthe extended senses of the machine," in a certain sense.
p213
aVSo we have a trillion eyes, and ears, and touches,
p214
aVthrough all our digital photographs and cameras.
p215
aVAnd we see that in things like Flickr,
p216
aVor Photosynth, this program from Microsoft
p217
aVthat will allow you to assemble a view of a touristy place
p218
aVfrom the thousands of tourist snapshots of it.
p219
aVIn a certain sense, the machine is seeing through the pixels of individual cameras.
p220
aa(lp221
VNow, the second thing that I want to talk about was this idea of restructuring,
p222
aVthat what the Web is doing is restructuring.
p223
aVAnd I have to warn you, that what we'll talk about is \u2014
p224
aVI'm going to give my explanation of a term you're hearing, which is a "semantic Web."
p225
aa(lp226
VSo first of all, the first stage that we've seen
p227
aVof the Internet was that it was going to link computers.
p228
aVAnd that's what we called the Net; that was the Internet of nets.
p229
aVAnd we saw that, where you have all the computers of the world.
p230
aVAnd if you remember, it was a kind of green screen with cursors,
p231
aVand there was really not much to do, and if you wanted to connect it,
p232
aVyou connected it from one computer to another computer.
p233
aVAnd what you had to do was \u2014 if you wanted to participate in this,
p234
aVyou had to share packets of information.
p235
aVSo you were forwarding on. You didn't have control.
p236
aVIt wasn't like a telephone system where you had control of a line:
p237
aVyou had to share packets.
p238
aa(lp239
VThe second stage that we're in now is the idea of linking pages.
p240
aVSo in the old one, if I wanted to go on to an airline Web page,
p241
aVI went from my computer, to an FTP site, to another airline computer.
p242
aVNow we have pages \u2014 the unit has been resolved into pages,
p243
aVso one page links to another page.
p244
aVAnd if I want to go in to book a flight,
p245
aVI go into the airline's flight page, the website of the airline,
p246
aVand I'm linking to that page.
p247
aVAnd what we're sharing were links, so you had to be kind of open with links.
p248
aVYou couldn't deny \u2014 if someone wanted to link to you,
p249
aVyou couldn't stop them. You had to participate in this idea
p250
aVof opening up your pages to be linked by anybody.
p251
aVSo that's what we were doing.
p252
aa(lp253
VWe're now entering to the third stage, which is what I'm talking about,
p254
aVand that is where we link the data.
p255
aVSo, I don't know what the name of this thing is.
p256
aVI'm calling it the one machine. But we're linking data.
p257
aVSo we're going from machine to machine,
p258
aVfrom page to page, and now data to data.
p259
aVSo the difference is, is that rather than linking from page to page,
p260
aVwe're actually going to link from one idea on a page
p261
aVto another idea, rather than to the other page.
p262
aVSo every idea is basically being supported \u2014
p263
aVor every item, or every noun \u2014 is being supported by the entire Web.
p264
aVIt's being resolved at the level of items, or ideas, or words, if you want.
p265
aVSo besides physically coming out again into this idea
p266
aVthat it's not just virtual, it's actually going out to things.
p267
aVSo something will resolve down to the information
p268
aVabout a particular person, so every person will have a unique ID.
p269
aVEvery person, every item will have a something
p270
aVthat will be very specific, and will link
p271
aVto a specific representation of that idea or item.
p272
aVSo now, in this new one, when I link to it,
p273
aVI would link to my particular flight, my particular seat.
p274
aVAnd so, giving an example of this thing,
p275
aVI live in Pacifica, rather than \u2014 right now Pacifica
p276
aVis just sort of a name on the Web somewhere.
p277
aVThe Web doesn't know that that is actually a town,
p278
aVand that it's a specific town that I live in,
p279
aVbut that's what we're going to be talking about.
p280
aVIt's going to link directly to \u2014
p281
aVit will know, the Web will be able to read itself
p282
aVand know that that actually is a place,
p283
aVand that whenever it sees that word, "Pacifica,"
p284
aVit knows that it actually has a place,
p285
aVlatitude, longitude, a certain population.
p286
aa(lp287
VSo here are some of the technical terms, all three-letter things,
p288
aVthat you'll see a lot more of.
p289
aVAll these things are about enabling this idea of linking to the data.
p290
aVSo I'll give you one kind of an example.
p291
aVThere's like a billion social sites on the Web.
p292
aVEach time you go into there, you have to tell it again who you are
p293
aVand all your friends are.
p294
aVWhy should you be doing that? You should just do that once,
p295
aVand it should know who all your friends are.
p296
aVSo that's what you want, is all your friends are identified,
p297
aVand you should just carry these relationships around.
p298
aVAll this data about you should just be conveyed,
p299
aVand you should do it once and that's all that should happen.
p300
aVAnd you should have all the networks
p301
aVof all the relationships between those pieces of data.
p302
aVThat's what we're moving into \u2014 where it sort of knows these things down to that level.
p303
aVA semantic Web, Web 3.0, giant global graph \u2014
p304
aVwe're kind of trying out what we want to call this thing.
p305
aVBut what's it's doing is sharing data.
p306
aVSo you have to be open to having your data shared, which is a much bigger step
p307
aVthan just sharing your Web page, or your computer.
p308
aVAnd all these things that are going to be on this
p309
aVare not just pages, they are things.
p310
aVEverything we've described, every artifact or place,
p311
aVwill be a specific representation,
p312
aVwill have a specific character that can be linked to directly.
p313
aVSo we have this database of things.
p314
aVAnd so there's actually a fourth thing that we have not get to,
p315
aVthat we won't see in the next 10 years, or 5,000 days,
p316
aVbut I think that's where we're going to. And as the Internet of things \u2014
p317
aVwhere I'm linking directly to the particular things of my seat on the plane \u2014
p318
aVthat that physical thing becomes part of the Web.
p319
aVAnd so we are in the middle of this thing
p320
aVthat's completely linked, down to every object
p321
aVin the little sliver of a connection that it has.
p322
aa(lp323
VSo, the last thing I want to talk about is this idea
p324
aVthat we're going to be codependent.
p325
aVIt's always going to be there, and the closer it is, the better.
p326
aVIf you allow Google to, it will tell you your search history.
p327
aVAnd I found out by looking at it
p328
aVthat I search most at 11 o'clock in the morning.
p329
aVSo I am open, and being transparent to that.
p330
aVAnd I think total personalization in this new world will require total transparency.
p331
aVThat is going to be the price.
p332
aVIf you want to have total personalization,
p333
aVyou have to be totally transparent.
p334
aVGoogle. I can't remember my phone number, I'll just ask Google.
p335
aVWe're so dependent on this that I have now gotten to the point
p336
aVwhere I don't even try to remember things \u2014
p337
aVI'll just Google it. It's easier to do that.
p338
aVAnd we kind of object at first, saying, "Oh, that's awful."
p339
aVBut if we think about the dependency that we have on this other technology,
p340
aVcalled the alphabet, and writing,
p341
aVwe're totally dependent on it, and it's transformed culture.
p342
aVWe cannot imagine ourselves without the alphabet and writing.
p343
aVAnd so in the same way, we're going to not imagine ourselves
p344
aVwithout this other machine being there.
p345
aVAnd what is happening with this is
p346
aVsome kind of AI, but it's not the AI in conscious AI,
p347
aVas being an expert, Larry Page told me
p348
aVthat that's what they're trying to do,
p349
aVand that's what they're trying to do.
p350
aVBut when six billion humans are Googling,
p351
aVwho's searching who? It goes both ways.
p352
aVSo we are the Web, that's what this thing is.
p353
aVWe are going to be the machine.
p354
aVSo the next 5,000 days, it's not going to be the Web and only better.
p355
aVJust like it wasn't TV and only better.
p356
aVThe next 5,000 days, it's not just going to be the Web
p357
aVbut only better \u2014 it's going to be something different.
p358
aVAnd I think it's going to be smarter.
p359
aVIt'll have an intelligence in there, that's not, again, conscious.
p360
aVBut it'll anticipate what we're doing, in a good sense.
p361
aVSecondly, it's become much more personalized.
p362
aVIt will know us, and that's good.
p363
aVAnd again, the price of that will be transparency.
p364
aVAnd thirdly, it's going to become more ubiquitous
p365
aVin terms of filling your entire environment, and we will be in the middle of it.
p366
aVAnd all these devices will be portals into that.
p367
aa(lp368
VSo the single idea that I wanted to leave with you
p369
aVis that we have to begin to think about this as not just "the Web, only better,"
p370
aVbut a new kind of stage in this development.
p371
aVIt looks more global. If you take this whole thing,
p372
aVit is a very big machine, very reliable machine,
p373
aVmore reliable than its parts.
p374
aVBut we can also think about it as kind of a large organism.
p375
aVSo we might respond to it more as if this was a whole system,
p376
aVmore as if this wasn't a large organism
p377
aVthat we are going to be interacting with. It's a "One."
p378
aVAnd I don't know what else to call it, than the One.
p379
aVWe'll have a better word for it.
