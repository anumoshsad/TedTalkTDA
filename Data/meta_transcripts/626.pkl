VI'm a creative technologist
p4
aVand the focus of my work is on public installations.
p5
aVOne of my driving passions
p6
aVis this idea of exploring nature,
p7
aVand trying to find hidden data within nature.
p8
aVIt seems to me that there is
p9
aVthis latent potential everywhere, all around us.
p10
aVEverything gives out some kind of data,
p11
aVwhether it's sound or smell or vibration.
p12
aVThrough my work, I've been
p13
aVtrying to find ways to harness and unveil this.
p14
aVAnd so this basically led me to
p15
aVa subject called cymatics.
p16
aVNow, cymatics is the process of visualizing sound
p17
aVby basically vibrating a medium such as sand or water,
p18
aVas you can see there.
p19
aa(lp20
VSo, if we have a quick look at the history of cymatics
p21
aVbeginning with the observations of resonance,
p22
aVby Da Vinci, Galileo, the English scientist Robert Hook
p23
aVand then Ernest Chladni.
p24
aVHe created an experiment using a metal plate,
p25
aVcovering it with sand and then bowing it
p26
aVto create the Chladni patterns that you see here on the right.
p27
aa(lp28
VMoving on from this, the next person to explore this field
p29
aVwas a gentleman called Hans Jenny in the 1970s.
p30
aVHe actually coined the term cymatics.
p31
aVThen bringing us into the present day
p32
aVis a fellow collaborator of mine
p33
aVand cymatics expert, John Stewart Reed.
p34
aVHe's kindly recreated for us
p35
aVthe Chladni experiment.
p36
aVWhat we can see here is
p37
aVthe metal sheet, this time connected to a sound driver
p38
aVand being fed by a frequency generator.
p39
aVAs the frequencies increase,
p40
aVso do the complexities of the patterns that appear on the plate.
p41
aVAs you can see with your own eyes.
p42
aV(Applause)
p43
aa(lp44
VSo, what excites me about cymatics?
p45
aVWell, for me cymatics is an almost magical tool.
p46
aVIt's like a looking glass into a hidden world.
p47
aVThrough the numerous ways that we can apply cymatics,
p48
aVwe can actually start to unveil the substance of things not seen.
p49
aVDevices like the cymascope, which you can see here,
p50
aVhave been used to scientifically observe cymatic patterns.
p51
aVAnd the list of scientific applications is growing every day.
p52
aa(lp53
VFor example, in oceanography,
p54
aVa lexicon of dolphin language is actually being created
p55
aVby basically visualizing the sonar beams that the dolphins emit.
p56
aVAnd hopefully in the future we'll be able to gain some deeper understanding
p57
aVof how they communicate.
p58
aVWe can also use cymatics for healing and education.
p59
aVThis is an installation developed with school children,
p60
aVwhere their hands are tracked. It allows them
p61
aVto control and position cymatic patterns
p62
aVand the reflections that are caused by them.
p63
aVWe can also use cymatics as a beautiful natural art form.
p64
aa(lp65
VThis image here is created from a snippet
p66
aVof Beethoven's Ninth Symphony playing through a cymatic device.
p67
aVSo it kind of flips things on its head a little bit.
p68
aVThis is Pink Floyd's "Machine"
p69
aVplaying in real time through the cymascope.
p70
aVWe can also use cymatics as a looking glass into nature.
p71
aVAnd we can actually recreate the archetypal forms of nature.
p72
aVSo, for example, here on the left we can see a snowflake as it would appear in nature.
p73
aVThen on the right we can see a cymatically created snowflake.
p74
aVAnd here is a starfish and a cymatic starfish.
p75
aVAnd there is thousands of these.
p76
aa(lp77
VSo what does this all mean?
p78
aVWell, there is still a lot to explore
p79
aVin its early days. And there's not many people working in this field.
p80
aVBut consider for a moment that sound does have form.
p81
aVWe've seen that it can affect matter and cause form within matter.
p82
aVThen sort of take a leap and think about the universe forming.
p83
aVAnd think about the immense sound of the universe forming.
p84
aVAnd if we kind of ponder on that, then perhaps
p85
aVcymatics had an influence on the formation of the universe itself.
p86
aa(lp87
VAnd here is some eye candy for you, from a range of
p88
aVDIY scientists and artists
p89
aVfrom all over the globe.
p90
aVCymatics is accessible to everybody.
p91
aVI want to urge everybody here to
p92
aVapply your passion, your knowledge
p93
aVand your skills to areas like cymatics.
p94
aVI think collectively we can build a global community.
p95
aVWe can inspire each other.
p96
aVAnd we can evolve this exploration
p97
aVof the substance of things not seen. Thank you.
