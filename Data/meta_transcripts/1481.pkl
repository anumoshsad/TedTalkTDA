VThose of you who have seen the film "Moneyball,"
p4
aVor have read the book by Michael Lewis,
p5
aVwill be familiar with the story of Billy Beane.
p6
aVBilly was supposed to be a tremendous ballplayer; all the scouts told him so.
p7
aVThey told his parents that
p8
aVthey predicted that he was going to be a star.
p9
aa(lp10
VBut what actually happened when he signed the contract \u2014 and by the way, he didn't
p11
aVwant to sign that contract, he wanted to go to college \u2014
p12
aVwhich is what my mother, who actually does love me,
p13
aVsaid that I should do too, and I did \u2014
p14
aVwell, he didn't do very well. He struggled mightily.
p15
aVHe got traded a couple of times, he ended up in the Minors for most of his career,
p16
aVand he actually ended up in management. He ended up as a General Manager of the
p17
aVOakland A's.
p18
aa(lp19
VNow for many of you in this room, ending up in management, which is also what I've done,
p20
aVis seen as a success.
p21
aVI can assure you that for a kid trying to make it in the Bigs,
p22
aVgoing into management ain't no success story. It's a failure.
p23
aa(lp24
VAnd what I want to talk to you about today, and share with you, is that our
p25
aVhealthcare system, our medical system, is just as bad at predicting
p26
aVwhat happens to people in it \u2014 patients, others \u2014
p27
aVas those scouts were at predicting what would happen to Billy Beane.
p28
aVAnd yet, every day
p29
aVthousands of people in this country
p30
aVare diagnosed with preconditions.
p31
aa(lp32
VWe hear about pre-hypertension, we hear about pre-dementia,
p33
aVwe hear about pre-anxiety, and I'm pretty sure that I diagnosed myself with
p34
aVthat in the green room.
p35
aa(lp36
VWe also refer to subclinical conditions.
p37
aVThere's subclinical atherosclerosis, subclinical hardening of the arteries,
p38
aVobviously linked to heart attacks, potentially.
p39
aVOne of my favorites is called subclinical acne.
p40
aVIf you look up subclinical acne, you may find a website, which I did,
p41
aVwhich says that this is the easiest type of acne to treat.
p42
aVYou don't have the pustules or the redness and inflammation.
p43
aVMaybe that's because you don't actually have acne.
p44
aa(lp45
VI have a name for all of these conditions, it's another precondition:
p46
aVI call them preposterous.
p47
aVIn baseball, the game follows the pre-game.
p48
aVSeason follows the pre-season.
p49
aVBut with a lot of these conditions, that actually isn't the case, or at least it isn't the
p50
aVcase all the time. It's as if there's a rain delay, every single time in many cases.
p51
aa(lp52
VWe have pre-cancerous lesions,
p53
aVwhich often don't turn into cancer.
p54
aVAnd yet,
p55
aVif you take, for example, subclinical osteoporosis, a bone thinning disease,
p56
aVthe precondition,
p57
aVotherwise known as osteopenia,
p58
aVyou would have to treat 270 women for three years
p59
aVin order to prevent one broken bone.
p60
aVThat's an awful lot of women
p61
aVwhen you multiply by the number of women who were diagnosed
p62
aVwith this osteopenia.
p63
aa(lp64
VAnd so is it any wonder,
p65
aVgiven all of the costs and the side effects
p66
aVof the drugs that we're using to treat these preconditions, that every year
p67
aVwe're spending more than two trillion dollars on healthcare and yet
p68
aV100,000 people a year \u2014 and that's a conservative estimate \u2014 are dying
p69
aVnot because of the conditions they have,
p70
aVbut because of the treatments that we're giving them and the complications of those treatments?
p71
aa(lp72
VWe've medicalized everything
p73
aVin this country.
p74
aVWomen in the audience, I have some
p75
aVpretty bad news that you already know,
p76
aVand that's that every aspect of your life
p77
aa(lp78
Vhas been medicalized.
p79
aVStrike one is when you hit puberty.
p80
aVYou now have something that happens to you once a month that has been medicalized.
p81
aVIt's a condition;
p82
aVit has to be treated. Strike two
p83
aVis if you get pregnant.
p84
aVThat's been medicalized as well.
p85
aVYou have to have a high-tech experience
p86
aVof pregnancy, otherwise something might go wrong.
p87
aa(lp88
VStrike three is menopause.
p89
aVWe all know what happened when millions of women were given hormone replacement therapy
p90
aVfor menopausal symptoms
p91
aVfor decades until all of a sudden we realized, because a study came out, a big one,
p92
aVNIH-funded.
p93
aVIt said,
p94
aVactually, a lot of that hormone replacement therapy may be doing more harm than good
p95
aVfor many of those women.
p96
aa(lp97
VJust in case,
p98
aVI don't want to leave the men out \u2014
p99
aVI am one, after all \u2014
p100
aVI have really bad news for all of you in this room,
p101
aVand for everyone
p102
aVlistening and watching elsewhere:
p103
aVYou all have
p104
aVa universally fatal condition.
p105
aVSo, just take a moment.
p106
aVIt's called pre-death.
p107
aVEvery single one of you has it, because you have the risk factor for it,
p108
aVwhich is being alive.
p109
aa(lp110
VBut I have some good news for you, because
p111
aVI'm a journalist, I like to end things in a happy way or a forward-thinking way.
p112
aVAnd that good news is that if you can survive to the end of my talk, which
p113
aVwe'll see if that happens for everyone,
p114
aVyou will be a pre-vivor.
p115
aa(lp116
VI made up pre-death.
p117
aVIf I used someone else's pre-death, I apologize,
p118
aVI think I made it up.
p119
aVI didn't make up pre-vivor.
p120
aVPre-vivor is what a particular cancer advocacy group would like everyone who
p121
aVjust has a risk factor,
p122
aVbut hasn't actually had that cancer,
p123
aVto call themselves.
p124
aVYou are a pre-vivor.
p125
aa(lp126
VWe've had HBO here this morning. I'm wondering if Mark Burnett is anywhere in the
p127
aVaudience, I'd like to suggest
p128
aVa reality TV show called "Pre-vivor."
p129
aVIf you develop a disease, you're off the island.
p130
aa(lp131
VBut the problem is, we have a system
p132
aVthat is completely \u2014
p133
aVbasically promoted this.
p134
aVWe've selected, at every point in this system,
p135
aVto do what we do, and to give everyone a precondition and then eventually
p136
aVa condition, in some cases.
p137
aVStart with the doctor-patient relationship. Doctors, most of them,
p138
aVare in a fee-for-service system. They are basically incentivized to do more \u2014
p139
aVprocedures, tests,
p140
aVprescribe medications.
p141
aa(lp142
VPatients come to them,
p143
aVthey want to do something. We're Americans, we can't just stand
p144
aVthere, we have to do something. And so they want a drug.
p145
aVThey want a treatment. They want to be told, this is what you have and this is how
p146
aVyou treat it. If the doctor doesn't give you that,
p147
aVyou go somewhere else.
p148
aVThat's not very good for doctors' business.
p149
aVOr even worse,
p150
aVif you are diagnosed with something eventually, and the doctor didn't order that test,
p151
aVyou get sued.
p152
aa(lp153
VWe have pharmaceutical companies that are constantly trying to expand
p154
aVthe indications, expand the number of people who are eligible for a given treatment,
p155
aVbecause that obviously helps their bottom line. We have advocacy groups,
p156
aVlike the one that's come up with pre-vivor,
p157
aVwho want to make more and more people feel they are at risk, or might have a condition,
p158
aVso that they can raise more funds
p159
aVand raise visibility, et cetera.
p160
aa(lp161
VBut this isn't actually,
p162
aVdespite what journalists typically do, this isn't actually about blaming
p163
aVparticular players.
p164
aVWe are all responsible.
p165
aVI'm responsible.
p166
aVI actually root for the Yankees, I mean talk about
p167
aVrooting for the worst possible
p168
aVoffender when it comes to doing everything you can do.
p169
aVThank you.
p170
aVBut everyone is responsible.
p171
aa(lp172
VI went to medical school,
p173
aVand I didn't have a course called How to Think Skeptically,
p174
aVor How Not to Order Tests.
p175
aVWe have this system
p176
aVwhere that's what you do.
p177
aVAnd it actually took being a journalist
p178
aVto understand all these incentives. You know, economists like to say,
p179
aVthere are no bad people,
p180
aVthere are just bad incentives.
p181
aa(lp182
VAnd that's actually true.
p183
aVBecause what we've created is a sort of Field of Dreams, when it comes to medical technology.
p184
aVSo when you put another MRI in every corner, you put a robot
p185
aVin every hospital saying that everyone has to have robotic surgery.
p186
aVWell, we've created a system where if you build it, they will come.
p187
aVBut you can actually perversely
p188
aVtell people to come, convince them
p189
aVthat they have to come.
p190
aa(lp191
VIt was when I became a journalist that I really realized how I was part of this problem,
p192
aVand how we all are part of this problem.
p193
aVI was medicalizing every risk factor, I was writing stories, commissioning stories,
p194
aVevery day, that were trying to,
p195
aVnot necessarily make people worried, although that was what often happened.
p196
aa(lp197
VBut, you know, there are ways out.
p198
aVI saw my own internist last week,
p199
aVand he said to me,
p200
aV"You know," and he told me something that
p201
aVeveryone in this audience could have told me for free,
p202
aVbut I paid him for the privilege, which is that
p203
aVI need to lose some weight.
p204
aVWell, he's right. I've had honest-to-goodness high blood pressure
p205
aVfor a dozen years now, same
p206
aVage my father got it,
p207
aVand it's a real disease. It's not pre-hypertension, it's actual
p208
aVhypertension, high blood pressure.
p209
aa(lp210
VWell, he's right,
p211
aVbut he didn't say to me,
p212
aVwell, you have pre-obesity or
p213
aVyou have pre-diabetes, or anything like that. He didn't say,
p214
aVbetter start taking this Statin, you need to lower your cholesterol.
p215
aVNo, he said, "Go out and lose some weight. Come back and see me in a bit,
p216
aVor just give me a call and let me know how you're doing."
p217
aa(lp218
VSo that's, to me,
p219
aVa way forward.
p220
aVBilly Beane, by the way, learned the same thing.
p221
aVHe learned,
p222
aVfrom watching this kid who he eventually hired, who was really successful for him,
p223
aVthat it wasn't swinging for the fences, it wasn't swinging at every pitch
p224
aVlike the sluggers do, which is what all the expensive teams like the Yankees like to \u2014
p225
aVthey like to pick up those guys.
p226
aVThis kid told him, you know, you gotta watch the guys, and you gotta go out and find
p227
aVthe guys who like to walk,
p228
aVbecause getting on base by a walk
p229
aVis just as good, and in our healthcare system
p230
aVwe need to figure out,
p231
aVis that really a good pitch
p232
aVor should we let it go by and not swing at everything?
p233
aVThanks.
