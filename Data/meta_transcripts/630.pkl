VToday I'm going to talk to you about the problem of other minds.
p4
aVAnd the problem I'm going to talk about
p5
aVis not the familiar one from philosophy,
p6
aVwhich is, "How can we know
p7
aVwhether other people have minds?"
p8
aVThat is, maybe you have a mind,
p9
aVand everyone else is just a really convincing robot.
p10
aVSo that's a problem in philosophy,
p11
aVbut for today's purposes I'm going to assume
p12
aVthat many people in this audience have a mind,
p13
aVand that I don't have to worry about this.
p14
aa(lp15
VThere is a second problem that is maybe even more familiar to us
p16
aVas parents and teachers and spouses
p17
aVand novelists,
p18
aVwhich is, "Why is it so hard
p19
aVto know what somebody else wants or believes?"
p20
aVOr perhaps, more relevantly,
p21
aV"Why is it so hard to change what somebody else wants or believes?"
p22
aa(lp23
VI think novelists put this best.
p24
aVLike Philip Roth, who said,
p25
aV"And yet, what are we to do about this terribly significant business
p26
aVof other people?
p27
aVSo ill equipped are we all,
p28
aVto envision one another's interior workings
p29
aVand invisible aims."
p30
aVSo as a teacher and as a spouse,
p31
aVthis is, of course, a problem I confront every day.
p32
aVBut as a scientist, I'm interested in a different problem of other minds,
p33
aVand that is the one I'm going to introduce to you today.
p34
aVAnd that problem is, "How is it so easy
p35
aVto know other minds?"
p36
aa(lp37
VSo to start with an illustration,
p38
aVyou need almost no information,
p39
aVone snapshot of a stranger,
p40
aVto guess what this woman is thinking,
p41
aVor what this man is.
p42
aVAnd put another way, the crux of the problem is
p43
aVthe machine that we use for thinking about other minds,
p44
aVour brain, is made up of pieces, brain cells,
p45
aVthat we share with all other animals, with monkeys
p46
aVand mice and even sea slugs.
p47
aVAnd yet, you put them together in a particular network,
p48
aVand what you get is the capacity to write Romeo and Juliet.
p49
aVOr to say, as Alan Greenspan did,
p50
aV"I know you think you understand what you thought I said,
p51
aVbut I'm not sure you realize that what you heard
p52
aVis not what I meant."
p53
aV(Laughter)
p54
aa(lp55
VSo, the job of my field of cognitive neuroscience
p56
aVis to stand with these ideas,
p57
aVone in each hand.
p58
aVAnd to try to understand how you can put together
p59
aVsimple units, simple messages over space and time, in a network,
p60
aVand get this amazing human capacity to think about minds.
p61
aVSo I'm going to tell you three things about this today.
p62
aVObviously the whole project here is huge.
p63
aVAnd I'm going to tell you just our first few steps
p64
aVabout the discovery of a special brain region
p65
aVfor thinking about other people's thoughts.
p66
aVSome observations on the slow development of this system
p67
aVas we learn how to do this difficult job.
p68
aVAnd then finally, to show that some of the differences
p69
aVbetween people, in how we judge others,
p70
aVcan be explained by differences in this brain system.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo first, the first thing I want to tell you is that
p73
aVthere is a brain region in the human brain, in your brains,
p74
aVwhose job it is to think about other people's thoughts.
p75
aVThis is a picture of it.
p76
aVIt's called the Right Temporo-Parietal Junction.
p77
aVIt's above and behind your right ear.
p78
aVAnd this is the brain region you used when you saw the pictures I showed you,
p79
aVor when you read Romeo and Juliet
p80
aVor when you tried to understand Alan Greenspan.
p81
aVAnd you don't use it for solving any other kinds of logical problems.
p82
aVSo this brain region is called the Right TPJ.
p83
aVAnd this picture shows the average activation
p84
aVin a group of what we call typical human adults.
p85
aVThey're MIT undergraduates.
p86
aV(Laughter)
p87
aa(lp88
VThe second thing I want to say about this brain system
p89
aVis that although we human adults
p90
aVare really good at understanding other minds,
p91
aVwe weren't always that way.
p92
aVIt takes children a long time to break into the system.
p93
aVI'm going to show you a little bit of that long, extended process.
p94
aVThe first thing I'm going to show you is a change between age three and five,
p95
aVas kids learn to understand
p96
aVthat somebody else can have beliefs that are different from their own.
p97
aVSo I'm going to show you a five-year-old
p98
aVwho is getting a standard kind of puzzle
p99
aVthat we call the false belief task.
p100
aa(lp101
VRebecca Saxe (Video): This is the first pirate. His name is Ivan.
p102
aVAnd you know what pirates really like?
p103
aa(lp104
VChild: What? RS: Pirates really like cheese sandwiches.
p105
aa(lp106
VChild: Cheese? I love cheese!
p107
aa(lp108
VRS: Yeah. So Ivan has this cheese sandwich,
p109
aVand he says, "Yum yum yum yum yum!
p110
aVI really love cheese sandwiches."
p111
aVAnd Ivan puts his sandwich over here, on top of the pirate chest.
p112
aVAnd Ivan says, "You know what? I need a drink with my lunch."
p113
aVAnd so Ivan goes to get a drink.
p114
aVAnd while Ivan is away
p115
aVthe wind comes,
p116
aVand it blows the sandwich down onto the grass.
p117
aVAnd now, here comes the other pirate.
p118
aVThis pirate is called Joshua.
p119
aVAnd Joshua also really loves cheese sandwiches.
p120
aVSo Joshua has a cheese sandwich and he says,
p121
aV"Yum yum yum yum yum! I love cheese sandwiches."
p122
aVAnd he puts his cheese sandwich over here on top of the pirate chest.
p123
aa(lp124
VChild: So, that one is his.
p125
aa(lp126
VRS: That one is Joshua's. That's right.
p127
aa(lp128
VChild: And then his went on the ground.
p129
aa(lp130
VRS: That's exactly right.
p131
aa(lp132
VChild: So he won't know which one is his.
p133
aa(lp134
VRS: Oh. So now Joshua goes off to get a drink.
p135
aVIvan comes back and he says, "I want my cheese sandwich."
p136
aVSo which one do you think Ivan is going to take?
p137
aa(lp138
VChild: I think he is going to take that one.
p139
aa(lp140
VRS: Yeah, you think he's going to take that one? All right. Let's see.
p141
aVOh yeah, you were right. He took that one.
p142
aa(lp143
VSo that's a five-year-old who clearly understands
p144
aVthat other people can have false beliefs
p145
aVand what the consequences are for their actions.
p146
aVNow I'm going to show you a three-year-old
p147
aVwho got the same puzzle.
p148
aa(lp149
VRS: And Ivan says, "I want my cheese sandwich."
p150
aVWhich sandwich is he going to take?
p151
aVDo you think he's going to take that one? Let's see what happens.
p152
aVLet's see what he does. Here comes Ivan.
p153
aVAnd he says, "I want my cheese sandwich."
p154
aVAnd he takes this one.
p155
aVUh-oh. Why did he take that one?
p156
aa(lp157
VChild: His was on the grass.
p158
aa(lp159
VSo the three-year-old does two things differently.
p160
aVFirst, he predicts Ivan will take the sandwich
p161
aVthat's really his.
p162
aVAnd second, when he sees Ivan taking the sandwich where he left his,
p163
aVwhere we would say he's taking that one because he thinks it's his,
p164
aVthe three-year-old comes up with another explanation:
p165
aVHe's not taking his own sandwich because he doesn't want it,
p166
aVbecause now it's dirty, on the ground.
p167
aVSo that's why he's taking the other sandwich.
p168
aVNow of course, development doesn't end at five.
p169
aVAnd we can see the continuation of this process
p170
aVof learning to think about other people's thoughts
p171
aVby upping the ante
p172
aVand asking children now, not for an action prediction,
p173
aVbut for a moral judgment.
p174
aVSo first I'm going to show you the three-year-old again.
p175
aa(lp176
VRS.: So is Ivan being mean and naughty for taking Joshua's sandwich?
p177
aa(lp178
VChild: Yeah.
p179
aa(lp180
VRS: Should Ivan get in trouble for taking Joshua's sandwich?
p181
aa(lp182
VChild: Yeah.
p183
aa(lp184
VSo it's maybe not surprising he thinks it was mean of Ivan
p185
aVto take Joshua's sandwich,
p186
aVsince he thinks Ivan only took Joshua's sandwich
p187
aVto avoid having to eat his own dirty sandwich.
p188
aVBut now I'm going to show you the five-year-old.
p189
aVRemember the five-year-old completely understood
p190
aVwhy Ivan took Joshua's sandwich.
p191
aa(lp192
VRS: Was Ivan being mean and naughty
p193
aVfor taking Joshua's sandwich?
p194
aa(lp195
VChild: Um, yeah.
p196
aa(lp197
VAnd so, it is not until age seven
p198
aVthat we get what looks more like an adult response.
p199
aa(lp200
VRS: Should Ivan get in trouble for taking Joshua's sandwich?
p201
aa(lp202
VChild: No, because the wind should get in trouble.
p203
aa(lp204
VHe says the wind should get in trouble
p205
aVfor switching the sandwiches.
p206
aV(Laughter)
p207
aa(lp208
VAnd now what we've started to do in my lab
p209
aVis to put children into the brain scanner
p210
aVand ask what's going on in their brain
p211
aVas they develop this ability to think about other people's thoughts.
p212
aVSo the first thing is that in children we see this same brain region, the Right TPJ,
p213
aVbeing used while children are thinking about other people.
p214
aVBut it's not quite like the adult brain.
p215
aa(lp216
VSo whereas in the adults, as I told you,
p217
aVthis brain region is almost completely specialized \u2014
p218
aVit does almost nothing else except for thinking about other people's thoughts \u2014
p219
aVin children it's much less so,
p220
aVwhen they are age five to eight,
p221
aVthe age range of the children I just showed you.
p222
aVAnd actually if we even look at eight to 11-year-olds,
p223
aVgetting into early adolescence,
p224
aVthey still don't have quite an adult-like brain region.
p225
aVAnd so, what we can see is that over the course of childhood
p226
aVand even into adolescence,
p227
aVboth the cognitive system,
p228
aVour mind's ability to think about other minds,
p229
aVand the brain system that supports it
p230
aVare continuing, slowly, to develop.
p231
aa(lp232
VBut of course, as you're probably aware,
p233
aVeven in adulthood,
p234
aVpeople differ from one another in how good they are
p235
aVat thinking of other minds, how often they do it
p236
aVand how accurately.
p237
aVAnd so what we wanted to know was, could differences among adults
p238
aVin how they think about other people's thoughts
p239
aVbe explained in terms of differences in this brain region?
p240
aVSo, the first thing that we did is we gave adults a version
p241
aVof the pirate problem that we gave to the kids.
p242
aVAnd I'm going to give that to you now.
p243
aa(lp244
VSo Grace and her friend are on a tour of a chemical factory,
p245
aVand they take a break for coffee.
p246
aVAnd Grace's friend asks for some sugar in her coffee.
p247
aVGrace goes to make the coffee
p248
aVand finds by the coffee a pot
p249
aVcontaining a white powder, which is sugar.
p250
aVBut the powder is labeled "Deadly Poison,"
p251
aVso Grace thinks that the powder is a deadly poison.
p252
aVAnd she puts it in her friend's coffee.
p253
aVAnd her friend drinks the coffee, and is fine.
p254
aa(lp255
VHow many people think it was morally permissible
p256
aVfor Grace to put the powder in the coffee?
p257
aVOkay. Good. (Laughter)
p258
aVSo we ask people, how much should Grace be blamed
p259
aVin this case, which we call a failed attempt to harm?
p260
aa(lp261
VAnd we can compare that to another case,
p262
aVwhere everything in the real world is the same.
p263
aVThe powder is still sugar, but what's different is what Grace thinks.
p264
aVNow she thinks the powder is sugar.
p265
aVAnd perhaps unsurprisingly, if Grace thinks the powder is sugar
p266
aVand puts it in her friend's coffee,
p267
aVpeople say she deserves no blame at all.
p268
aVWhereas if she thinks the powder was poison, even though it's really sugar,
p269
aVnow people say she deserves a lot of blame,
p270
aVeven though what happened in the real world was exactly the same.
p271
aa(lp272
VAnd in fact, they say she deserves more blame
p273
aVin this case, the failed attempt to harm,
p274
aVthan in another case,
p275
aVwhich we call an accident.
p276
aVWhere Grace thought the powder was sugar,
p277
aVbecause it was labeled "sugar" and by the coffee machine,
p278
aVbut actually the powder was poison.
p279
aVSo even though when the powder was poison,
p280
aVthe friend drank the coffee and died,
p281
aVpeople say Grace deserves less blame in that case,
p282
aVwhen she innocently thought it was sugar,
p283
aVthan in the other case, where she thought it was poison
p284
aVand no harm occurred.
p285
aa(lp286
VPeople, though, disagree a little bit
p287
aVabout exactly how much blame Grace should get
p288
aVin the accident case.
p289
aVSome people think she should deserve more blame,
p290
aVand other people less.
p291
aVAnd what I'm going to show you is what happened when we look inside
p292
aVthe brains of people while they're making that judgment.
p293
aVSo what I'm showing you, from left to right,
p294
aVis how much activity there was in this brain region,
p295
aVand from top to bottom, how much blame
p296
aVpeople said that Grace deserved.
p297
aa(lp298
VAnd what you can see is, on the left
p299
aVwhen there was very little activity in this brain region,
p300
aVpeople paid little attention to her innocent belief
p301
aVand said she deserved a lot of blame for the accident.
p302
aVWhereas on the right, where there was a lot of activity,
p303
aVpeople paid a lot more attention to her innocent belief,
p304
aVand said she deserved a lot less blame
p305
aVfor causing the accident.
p306
aa(lp307
VSo that's good, but of course
p308
aVwhat we'd rather is have a way to interfere
p309
aVwith function in this brain region,
p310
aVand see if we could change people's moral judgment.
p311
aVAnd we do have such a tool.
p312
aVIt's called Trans-Cranial Magnetic Stimulation,
p313
aVor TMS.
p314
aVThis is a tool that lets us pass a magnetic pulse
p315
aVthrough somebody's skull, into a small region of their brain,
p316
aVand temporarily disorganize the function of the neurons in that region.
p317
aa(lp318
VSo I'm going to show you a demo of this.
p319
aVFirst, I'm going to show you that this is a magnetic pulse.
p320
aVI'm going to show you what happens when you put a quarter on the machine.
p321
aVWhen you hear clicks, we're turning the machine on.
p322
aVSo now I'm going to apply that same pulse to my brain,
p323
aVto the part of my brain that controls my hand.
p324
aVSo there is no physical force, just a magnetic pulse.
p325
aa(lp326
VWoman (Video): Ready, Rebecca? RS: Yes.
p327
aa(lp328
VOkay, so it causes a small involuntary contraction in my hand
p329
aVby putting a magnetic pulse in my brain.
p330
aVAnd we can use that same pulse,
p331
aVnow applied to the RTPJ,
p332
aVto ask if we can change people's moral judgments.
p333
aVSo these are the judgments I showed you before, people's normal moral judgments.
p334
aVAnd then we can apply TMS to the RTPJ
p335
aVand ask how people's judgments change.
p336
aVAnd the first thing is, people can still do this task overall.
p337
aa(lp338
VSo their judgments of the case when everything was fine
p339
aVremain the same. They say she deserves no blame.
p340
aVBut in the case of a failed attempt to harm,
p341
aVwhere Grace thought that it was poison, although it was really sugar,
p342
aVpeople now say it was more okay, she deserves less blame
p343
aVfor putting the powder in the coffee.
p344
aa(lp345
VAnd in the case of the accident, where she thought that it was sugar,
p346
aVbut it was really poison and so she caused a death,
p347
aVpeople say that it was less okay, she deserves more blame.
p348
aVSo what I've told you today is that
p349
aVpeople come, actually, especially well equipped
p350
aVto think about other people's thoughts.
p351
aa(lp352
VWe have a special brain system
p353
aVthat lets us think about what other people are thinking.
p354
aVThis system takes a long time to develop,
p355
aVslowly throughout the course of childhood and into early adolescence.
p356
aVAnd even in adulthood, differences in this brain region
p357
aVcan explain differences among adults
p358
aVin how we think about and judge other people.
p359
aa(lp360
VBut I want to give the last word back to the novelists,
p361
aVand to Philip Roth, who ended by saying,
p362
aV"The fact remains that getting people right
p363
aVis not what living is all about anyway.
p364
aVIt's getting them wrong that is living.
p365
aVGetting them wrong and wrong and wrong,
p366
aVand then on careful reconsideration,
p367
aVgetting them wrong again."
p368
aVThank you.
p369
aV(Applause)
p370
aa(lp371
VChris Anderson: So, I have a question. When you start talking about using
p372
aVmagnetic pulses to change people's moral judgments,
p373
aVthat sounds alarming.
p374
aV(Laughter)
p375
aVPlease tell me that you're not taking phone calls from the Pentagon, say.
p376
aa(lp377
VRS: I'm not.
p378
aVI mean, they're calling, but I'm not taking the call.
p379
aV(Laughter)
p380
aa(lp381
VCA: They really are calling?
p382
aVSo then seriously,
p383
aVyou must lie awake at night sometimes
p384
aVwondering where this work leads.
p385
aVI mean, you're clearly an incredible human being,
p386
aVbut someone could take this knowledge
p387
aVand in some future
p388
aVnot-torture chamber,
p389
aVdo acts that people here might be worried about.
p390
aa(lp391
VRS: Yeah, we worry about this.
p392
aVSo, there's a couple of things to say about TMS.
p393
aVOne is that you can't be TMSed without knowing it.
p394
aVSo it's not a surreptitious technology.
p395
aVIt's quite hard, actually, to get those very small changes.
p396
aVThe changes I showed you are impressive to me
p397
aVbecause of what they tell us about the function of the brain,
p398
aVbut they're small on the scale
p399
aVof the moral judgments that we actually make.
p400
aa(lp401
VAnd what we changed was not people's
p402
aVmoral judgments when they're deciding what to do,
p403
aVwhen they're making action choices.
p404
aVWe changed their ability to judge other people's actions.
p405
aVAnd so, I think of what I'm doing not so much as
p406
aVstudying the defendant in a criminal trial,
p407
aVbut studying the jury.
p408
aa(lp409
VCA: Is your work going to lead to any recommendations
p410
aVin education, to perhaps bring up
p411
aVa generation of kids able to make fairer moral judgments?
p412
aa(lp413
VRS: That's one of the idealistic hopes.
p414
aVThe whole research program here of studying
p415
aVthe distinctive parts of the human brain is brand new.
p416
aVUntil recently, what we knew about the brain
p417
aVwere the things that any other animal's brain could do too,
p418
aVso we could study it in animal models.
p419
aVWe knew how brains see, and how they control the body
p420
aVand how they hear and sense.
p421
aVAnd the whole project of understanding
p422
aVhow brains do the uniquely human things \u2014
p423
aVlearn language and abstract concepts,
p424
aVand thinking about other people's thoughts \u2014 that's brand new.
p425
aVAnd we don't know yet what the implications will be
p426
aVof understanding it.
p427
aa(lp428
VCA: So I've got one last question. There is this thing called
p429
aVthe hard problem of consciousness,
p430
aVthat puzzles a lot of people.
p431
aVThe notion that you can understand
p432
aVwhy a brain works, perhaps.
p433
aVBut why does anyone have to feel anything?
p434
aVWhy does it seem to require these beings who sense things
p435
aVfor us to operate?
p436
aVYou're a brilliant young neuroscientist.
p437
aVI mean, what chances do you think there are
p438
aVthat at some time in your career,
p439
aVsomeone, you or someone else,
p440
aVis going to come up with some paradigm shift
p441
aVin understanding what seems an impossible problem?
p442
aa(lp443
VRS: I hope they do. And I think they probably won't.
p444
aa(lp445
VCA: Why?
p446
aa(lp447
VRS: It's not called the hard problem of consciousness for nothing.
p448
aV(Laughter)
p449
aa(lp450
VCA: That's a great answer. Rebecca Saxe, thank you very much. That was fantastic.
