VSo, stepping down out of the bus,
p4
aVI headed back to the corner
p5
aVto head west en route to a braille training session.
p6
aVIt was the winter of 2009,
p7
aVand I had been blind for about a year.
p8
aVThings were going pretty well.
p9
aVSafely reaching the other side,
p10
aVI turned to the left,
p11
aVpushed the auto-button for the audible pedestrian signal,
p12
aVand waited my turn.
p13
aVAs it went off, I took off
p14
aVand safely got to the other side.
p15
aVStepping onto the sidewalk,
p16
aVI then heard the sound of a steel chair
p17
aVslide across the concrete sidewalk in front of me.
p18
aVI know there's a cafe on the corner,
p19
aVand they have chairs out in front,
p20
aVso I just adjusted to the left
p21
aVto get closer to the street.
p22
aVAs I did, so slid the chair.
p23
aVI just figured I'd made a mistake,
p24
aVand went back to the right,
p25
aVand so slid the chair in perfect synchronicity.
p26
aVNow I was getting a little anxious.
p27
aVI went back to the left,
p28
aVand so slid the chair,
p29
aVblocking my path of travel.
p30
aVNow, I was officially freaking out.
p31
aVSo I yelled,
p32
aV"Who the hell's out there? What's going on?"
p33
aVJust then, over my shout,
p34
aVI heard something else, a familiar rattle.
p35
aVIt sounded familiar,
p36
aVand I quickly considered another possibility,
p37
aVand I reached out with my left hand,
p38
aVas my fingers brushed against something fuzzy,
p39
aVand I came across an ear,
p40
aVthe ear of a dog, perhaps a golden retriever.
p41
aVIts leash had been tied to the chair
p42
aVas her master went in for coffee,
p43
aVand she was just persistent in her efforts
p44
aVto greet me, perhaps get a scratch behind the ear.
p45
aVWho knows, maybe she was volunteering for service.
p46
aV(Laughter)
p47
aa(lp48
VBut that little story is really about
p49
aVthe fears and misconceptions that come along
p50
aVwith the idea of moving through the city
p51
aVwithout sight,
p52
aVseemingly oblivious to the environment
p53
aVand the people around you.
p54
aa(lp55
VSo let me step back and set the stage a little bit.
p56
aVOn St. Patrick's Day of 2008,
p57
aVI reported to the hospital for surgery
p58
aVto remove a brain tumor.
p59
aVThe surgery was successful.
p60
aVTwo days later, my sight started to fail.
p61
aVOn the third day, it was gone.
p62
aa(lp63
VImmediately, I was struck by an incredible sense
p64
aVof fear, of confusion, of vulnerability,
p65
aVlike anybody would.
p66
aVBut as I had time to stop and think,
p67
aVI actually started to realize
p68
aVI had a lot to be grateful for.
p69
aVIn particular, I thought about my dad,
p70
aVwho had passed away from complications
p71
aVfrom brain surgery.
p72
aVHe was 36. I was seven at the time.
p73
aVSo although I had every reason
p74
aVto be fearful of what was ahead,
p75
aVand had no clue quite what was going to happen,
p76
aVI was alive.
p77
aVMy son still had his dad.
p78
aVAnd besides, it's not like I was the first person
p79
aVever to lose their sight.
p80
aVI knew there had to be all sorts of systems
p81
aVand techniques and training to have
p82
aVto live a full and meaningful, active life
p83
aVwithout sight.
p84
aa(lp85
VSo by the time I was discharged from the hospital
p86
aVa few days later, I left with a mission,
p87
aVa mission to get out and get the best training
p88
aVas quickly as I could and get on to rebuilding my life.
p89
aVWithin six months, I had returned to work.
p90
aVMy training had started.
p91
aVI even started riding a tandem bike
p92
aVwith my old cycling buddies,
p93
aVand was commuting to work on my own,
p94
aVwalking through town and taking the bus.
p95
aVIt was a lot of hard work.
p96
aa(lp97
VBut what I didn't anticipate
p98
aVthrough that rapid transition
p99
aVwas the incredible experience of the juxtaposition
p100
aVof my sighted experience up against my unsighted experience
p101
aVof the same places and the same people
p102
aVwithin such a short period of time.
p103
aa(lp104
VFrom that came a lot of insights,
p105
aVor outsights, as I called them,
p106
aVthings that I learned since losing my sight.
p107
aVThese outsights ranged from the trival
p108
aVto the profound,
p109
aVfrom the mundane to the humorous.
p110
aVAs an architect, that stark juxtaposition
p111
aVof my sighted and unsighted experience
p112
aVof the same places and the same cities
p113
aVwithin such a short period of time
p114
aVhas given me all sorts of wonderful outsights
p115
aVof the city itself.
p116
aVParamount amongst those
p117
aVwas the realization that, actually,
p118
aVcities are fantastic places for the blind.
p119
aVAnd then I was also surprised
p120
aVby the city's propensity for kindness and care
p121
aVas opposed to indifference or worse.
p122
aVAnd then I started to realize that
p123
aVit seemed like the blind seemed to have
p124
aVa positive influence on the city itself.
p125
aVThat was a little curious to me.
p126
aa(lp127
VLet me step back and take a look
p128
aVat why the city is so good for the blind.
p129
aVInherent with the training for recovery from sight loss
p130
aVis learning to rely on all your non-visual senses,
p131
aVthings that you would otherwise maybe ignore.
p132
aVIt's like a whole new world of sensory information
p133
aVopens up to you.
p134
aVI was really struck by the symphony
p135
aVof subtle sounds all around me in the city
p136
aVthat you can hear and work with
p137
aVto understand where you are,
p138
aVhow you need to move, and where you need to go.
p139
aVSimilarly, just through the grip of the cane,
p140
aVyou can feel contrasting textures in the floor below,
p141
aVand over time you build a pattern of where you are
p142
aVand where you're headed.
p143
aVSimilarly, just the sun warming one side of your face
p144
aVor the wind at your neck
p145
aVgives you clues about your alignment
p146
aVand your progression through a block
p147
aVand your movement through time and space.
p148
aVBut also, the sense of smell.
p149
aVSome districts and cities have their own smell,
p150
aVas do places and things around you,
p151
aVand if you're lucky, you can even follow your nose
p152
aVto that new bakery that you've been looking for.
p153
aa(lp154
VAll this really surprised me,
p155
aVbecause I started to realize that
p156
aVmy unsighted experienced
p157
aVwas so far more multi-sensory
p158
aVthan my sighted experience ever was.
p159
aVWhat struck me also was how much the city
p160
aVwas changing around me.
p161
aVWhen you're sighted,
p162
aVeverybody kind of sticks to themselves,
p163
aVyou mind your own business.
p164
aVLose your sight, though,
p165
aVand it's a whole other story.
p166
aVAnd I don't know who's watching who,
p167
aVbut I have a suspicion that a lot of people are watching me.
p168
aVAnd I'm not paranoid, but everywhere I go,
p169
aVI'm getting all sorts of advice:
p170
aVGo here, move there, watch out for this.
p171
aVA lot of the information is good.
p172
aVSome of it's helpful. A lot of it's kind of reversed.
p173
aVYou've got to figure out what they actually meant.
p174
aVSome of it's kind of wrong and not helpful.
p175
aVBut it's all good in the grand scheme of things.
p176
aa(lp177
VBut one time I was in Oakland
p178
aVwalking along Broadway, and came to a corner.
p179
aVI was waiting for an audible pedestrian signal,
p180
aVand as it went off, I was just about to step out into the street,
p181
aVwhen all of a sudden, my right hand
p182
aVwas just gripped by this guy,
p183
aVand he yanked my arm and pulled me out into the crosswalk
p184
aVand was dragging me out across the street,
p185
aVspeaking to me in Mandarin.
p186
aV(Laughter)
p187
aVIt's like, there was no escape from this man's death grip,
p188
aVbut he got me safely there.
p189
aVWhat could I do?
p190
aVBut believe me, there are more polite ways
p191
aVto offer assistance.
p192
aVWe don't know you're there,
p193
aVso it's kind of nice to say "Hello" first.
p194
aV"Would you like some help?"
p195
aa(lp196
VBut while in Oakland, I've really been struck by
p197
aVhow much the city of Oakland changed
p198
aVas I lost my sight.
p199
aVI liked it sighted. It was fine.
p200
aVIt's a perfectly great city.
p201
aVBut once I lost my sight
p202
aVand was walking along Broadway,
p203
aVI was blessed every block of the way.
p204
aa(lp205
V"Bless you, man."
p206
aa(lp207
V"Go for it, brother."
p208
aa(lp209
V"God bless you."
p210
aa(lp211
VI didn't get that sighted.
p212
aV(Laughter)
p213
aVAnd even without sight, I don't get that in San Francisco.
p214
aVAnd I know it bothers some of my blind friends,
p215
aVit's not just me.
p216
aVOften it's thought that
p217
aVthat's an emotion that comes up out of pity.
p218
aVI tend to think that it comes out of our shared humanity,
p219
aVout of our togetherness, and I think it's pretty cool.
p220
aVIn fact, if I'm feeling down,
p221
aVI just go to Broadway in downtown Oakland,
p222
aVI go for a walk, and I feel better like that,
p223
aVin no time at all.
p224
aa(lp225
VBut also that it illustrates how
p226
aVdisability and blindness
p227
aVsort of cuts across ethnic, social,
p228
aVracial, economic lines.
p229
aVDisability is an equal-opportunity provider.
p230
aVEverybody's welcome.
p231
aVIn fact, I've heard it said in the disability community
p232
aVthat there are really only two types of people:
p233
aVThere are those with disabilities,
p234
aVand there are those that haven't quite found theirs yet.
p235
aVIt's a different way of thinking about it,
p236
aVbut I think it's kind of beautiful,
p237
aVbecause it is certainly far more inclusive
p238
aVthan the us-versus-them
p239
aVor the abled-versus-the-disabled,
p240
aVand it's a lot more honest and respectful
p241
aVof the fragility of life.
p242
aa(lp243
VSo my final takeaway for you is
p244
aVthat not only is the city good for the blind,
p245
aVbut the city needs us.
p246
aVAnd I'm so sure of that that
p247
aVI want to propose to you today
p248
aVthat the blind be taken as the prototypical city dwellers
p249
aVwhen imagining new and wonderful cities,
p250
aVand not the people that are thought about
p251
aVafter the mold has already been cast.
p252
aVIt's too late then.
p253
aVSo if you design a city with the blind in mind,
p254
aVyou'll have a rich, walkable network of sidewalks
p255
aVwith a dense array of options and choices
p256
aVall available at the street level.
p257
aVIf you design a city with the blind in mind,
p258
aVsidewalks will be predictable and will be generous.
p259
aVThe space between buildings will be well-balanced
p260
aVbetween people and cars.
p261
aVIn fact, cars, who needs them?
p262
aVIf you're blind, you don't drive. (Laughter)
p263
aVThey don't like it when you drive. (Laughter)
p264
aVIf you design a city with the blind in mind,
p265
aVyou design a city with a robust,
p266
aVaccessible, well-connected mass transit system
p267
aVthat connects all parts of the city
p268
aVand the region all around.
p269
aVIf you design a city with the blind in mind,
p270
aVthere'll be jobs, lots of jobs.
p271
aVBlind people want to work too.
p272
aVThey want to earn a living.
p273
aa(lp274
VSo, in designing a city for the blind,
p275
aVI hope you start to realize
p276
aVthat it actually would be a more inclusive,
p277
aVa more equitable, a more just city for all.
p278
aVAnd based on my prior sighted experience,
p279
aVit sounds like a pretty cool city,
p280
aVwhether you're blind, whether you have a disability,
p281
aVor you haven't quite found yours yet.
p282
aa(lp283
VSo thank you.
