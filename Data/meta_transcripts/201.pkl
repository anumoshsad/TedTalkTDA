VSo I thought, "I will talk about death."
p4
aVSeemed to be the passion today.
p5
aVActually, it's not about death.
p6
aVIt's inevitable, terrible, but really what I want to talk about is,
p7
aVI'm just fascinated by the legacy people leave when they die.
p8
aVThat's what I want to talk about.

VSo Art Buchwald left his legacy of humor with a video
p11
aVthat appeared soon after he died, saying,
p12
aV"Hi! I'm Art Buchwald, and I just died."
p13
aVAnd Mike, who I met at Galapagos, a trip which I won at TED,
p14
aVis leaving notes on cyberspace where he is chronicling
p15
aVhis journey through cancer.
p16
aVAnd my father left me a legacy of his handwriting
p17
aVthrough letters and a notebook.
p18
aVIn the last two years of his life, when he was sick,
p19
aVhe filled a notebook with his thoughts about me.
p20
aVHe wrote about my strengths, weaknesses,
p21
aVand gentle suggestions for improvement,
p22
aVquoting specific incidents, and held a mirror to my life.
p23
aa(lp24
VAfter he died, I realized that no one writes to me anymore.
p25
aVHandwriting is a disappearing art.
p26
aVI'm all for email and thinking while typing,
p27
aVbut why give up old habits for new?
p28
aVWhy can't we have letter writing and email exchange in our lives?
p29
aVThere are times when I want to trade all those years
p30
aVthat I was too busy to sit with my dad and chat with him,
p31
aVand trade all those years for one hug.
p32
aVBut too late.
p33
aVBut that's when I take out his letters and I read them,
p34
aVand the paper that touched his hand is in mine,
p35
aVand I feel connected to him.
p36
aa(lp37
VSo maybe we all need to leave our children
p38
aVwith a value legacy, and not a financial one.
p39
aVA value for things with a personal touch \u2014
p40
aVan autographed book, a soul-searching letter.
p41
aVIf a fraction of this powerful TED audience
p42
aVcould be inspired to buy a beautiful paper \u2014
p43
aVJohn, it'll be a recycled one \u2014 and write a beautiful letter
p44
aVto someone they love, we actually may start a revolution
p45
aVwhere our children may go to penmanship classes.
p46
aa(lp47
VSo what do I plan to leave for my son?
p48
aVI collect autographed books, and those of you authors
p49
aVin the audience know I hound you for them \u2014
p50
aVand CDs too, Tracy.
p51
aVI plan to publish my own notebook.
p52
aVAs I witnessed my father's body being swallowed by fire,
p53
aVI sat by his funeral pyre and wrote.
p54
aVI have no idea how I'm going to do it,
p55
aVbut I am committed to compiling his thoughts and mine
p56
aVinto a book, and leave that published book for my son.
p57
aa(lp58
VI'd like to end with a few verses of what I wrote
p59
aVat my father's cremation.
p60
aVAnd those linguists, please pardon the grammar,
p61
aVbecause I've not looked at it in the last 10 years.
p62
aVI took it out for the first time to come here.
p63
aV"Picture in a frame, ashes in a bottle,
p64
aVboundless energy confined in the bottle,
p65
aVforcing me to deal with reality,
p66
aVforcing me to deal with being grown up.
p67
aVI hear you and I know that you would want me to be strong,
p68
aVbut right now, I am being sucked down, surrounded
p69
aVand suffocated by these raging emotional waters,
p70
aVcraving to cleanse my soul, trying to emerge
p71
aVon a firm footing one more time, to keep on fighting and flourishing
p72
aVjust as you taught me.
p73
aVYour encouraging whispers in my whirlpool of despair,
p74
aVholding me and heaving me to shores of sanity,
p75
aVto live again and to love again."
p76
aVThank you.
