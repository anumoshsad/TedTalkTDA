VEarly visions of wireless power
p4
aVactually were thought of by Nikola Tesla
p5
aVbasically about 100 years ago.
p6
aVThe thought that
p7
aVyou wouldn't want to transfer electric power wirelessly,
p8
aVno one ever thought of that.
p9
aVThey thought, "Who would use it if you didn't?"
p10
aVAnd so, in fact, he actually set about
p11
aVdoing a variety of things.
p12
aVBuilt the Tesla coil. This tower was built
p13
aVon Long Island back at the beginning of the 1900s.
p14
aVAnd the idea was, it was supposed to be able to transfer power
p15
aVanywhere on Earth.
p16
aVWe'll never know if this stuff worked. Actually, I think the
p17
aVFederal Bureau of Investigation
p18
aVtook it down for security purposes,
p19
aVsometime in the early 1900s.
p20
aa(lp21
VBut the one thing that did come out of electricity
p22
aVis that we love this stuff so much.
p23
aVI mean, think about how much we love this.
p24
aVIf you just walk outside, there are trillions of dollars
p25
aVthat have been invested in infrastructure around the world,
p26
aVputting up wires to get power from where it's created
p27
aVto where it's used.
p28
aVThe other thing is, we love batteries.
p29
aVAnd for those of us that have an environmental element to us,
p30
aVthere is something like 40 billion
p31
aVdisposable batteries built every year
p32
aVfor power that, generally speaking,
p33
aVis used within a few inches or a few feet
p34
aVof where there is very inexpensive power.
p35
aa(lp36
VSo, before I got here,
p37
aVI thought, "You know, I am from North America.
p38
aVWe do have a little bit of a reputation in the United States."
p39
aVSo I thought I'd better look it up first.
p40
aVSo definition number six is the North American
p41
aVdefinition of the word "suck."
p42
aVWires suck, they really do.
p43
aVThink about it. Whether that's you in that picture
p44
aVor something under your desk.
p45
aVThe other thing is, batteries suck too.
p46
aVAnd they really, really do.
p47
aVDo you ever wonder what happens to this stuff?
p48
aV40 billion of these things built.
p49
aVThis is what happens.
p50
aVThey fall apart, they disintegrate,
p51
aVand they end up here.
p52
aa(lp53
VSo when you talk about expensive power,
p54
aVthe cost per kilowatt-hour
p55
aVto supply battery power to something
p56
aVis on the order of two to three hundred pounds.
p57
aVThink about that.
p58
aVThe most expensive grid power in the world
p59
aVis thousandths of that.
p60
aVSo fortunately, one of the other definitions
p61
aVof "suck" that was in there, it does create a vacuum.
p62
aVAnd nature really does abhor a vacuum.
p63
aa(lp64
VWhat happened back a few years ago
p65
aVwas a group of theoretical physicists at MIT
p66
aVactually came up with this concept of transferring power over distance.
p67
aVBasically they were able to light a 60 watt light bulb
p68
aVat a distance of about two meters.
p69
aVIt got about 50 percent of the efficiency \u2014
p70
aVby the way, that's still a couple thousand times
p71
aVmore efficient than a battery would be, to do the same thing.
p72
aVBut were able to light that,
p73
aVand do it very successfully.
p74
aVThis was actually the experiment. So you can see
p75
aVthe coils were somewhat larger.
p76
aVThe light bulb was a fairly simple task, from their standpoint.
p77
aa(lp78
VThis all came from a professor
p79
aVwaking up at night to the third night in a row
p80
aVthat his wife's cellphone was beeping
p81
aVbecause it was running out of battery power.
p82
aVAnd he was thinking, "With all the electricity that's out there in the walls,
p83
aVwhy couldn't some of that just come into the phone so I could get some sleep?"
p84
aVAnd he actually came up with this concept
p85
aVof resonant energy transfer.
p86
aVBut inside a standard transformer are two coils of wire.
p87
aVAnd those two coils of wire are really, really close to each other,
p88
aVand actually do transfer power
p89
aVmagnetically and wirelessly, only over a very short distance.
p90
aa(lp91
VWhat Dr. Soljacic figured out how to do
p92
aVwas separate the coils in a transformer
p93
aVto a greater distance than the size of those transformers
p94
aVusing this technology, which is not dissimilar
p95
aVfrom the way an opera singer shatters a glass on the other side of the room.
p96
aVIt's a resonant phenomenon
p97
aVfor which he actually received a MacArthur Fellowship Award,
p98
aVwhich is nicknamed the Genius Award,
p99
aVlast September, for his discovery.
p100
aa(lp101
VSo how does it work?
p102
aVImagine a coil. For those of you that are engineers,
p103
aVthere's a capacitor attached to it too.
p104
aVAnd if you can cause that coil to resonate,
p105
aVwhat will happen is it will pulse
p106
aVat alternating current frequencies \u2014
p107
aVat a fairly high frequency, by the way.
p108
aVAnd if you can bring another device
p109
aVclose enough to the source,
p110
aVthat will only work at exactly that frequency,
p111
aVyou can actually get them to do what's called strongly couple,
p112
aVand transfer magnetic energy between them.
p113
aVAnd then what you do is, you start out with electricity,
p114
aVturn it into magnetic field, take that magnetic field,
p115
aVturn it back into electricity,
p116
aVand then you can use it.
p117
aa(lp118
VNumber one question I get asked.
p119
aVI mean, people are worried about cellphones being safe.
p120
aVYou know. What about safety?
p121
aVThe first thing is this is not a "radiative" technology.
p122
aVIt doesn't radiate.
p123
aVThere aren't electric fields here. It's a magnetic field.
p124
aVIt stays within either what we call the source,
p125
aVor within the device.
p126
aVAnd actually, the magnetic fields we're using
p127
aVare basically about the same as the Earth's magnetic field.
p128
aVWe live in a magnetic field.
p129
aa(lp130
VAnd the other thing that's pretty cool about the technology is
p131
aVthat it only transfers energy to things that work at exactly the same frequency.
p132
aVAnd it's virtually impossible in nature to make that happen.
p133
aVThen finally we have governmental bodies everywhere
p134
aVthat will regulate everything we do.
p135
aVThey've pretty much set field exposure limits,
p136
aVwhich all of the things in the stuff I'll show you today
p137
aVsort of sit underneath those guidelines.
p138
aa(lp139
VMobile electronics.
p140
aVHome electronics.
p141
aVThose cords under your desk, I bet everybody here
p142
aVhas something that looks like that or those batteries.
p143
aVThere are industrial applications.
p144
aVAnd then finally, electric vehicles.
p145
aVThese electric cars are beautiful.
p146
aVBut who is going to want to plug them in?
p147
aVImagine driving into your garage \u2014 we've built a system to do this \u2014
p148
aVyou drive into your garage, and the car charges itself,
p149
aVbecause there is a mat on the floor that's plugged into the wall.
p150
aVAnd it actually causes your car to charge safely and efficiently.
p151
aVThen there's all kinds of other applications. Implanted medical devices,
p152
aVwhere people don't have to die of infections anymore
p153
aVif you can seal the thing up.
p154
aVCredit cards, robot vacuum cleaners.
p155
aa(lp156
VSo what I'd like to do is take a couple minutes
p157
aVand show you, actually, how it works.
p158
aVAnd what I'm going to do is to show you pretty much what's here.
p159
aVYou've got a coil.
p160
aVThat coil is connected to an R.F. amplifier
p161
aVthat creates a high-frequency oscillating magnetic field.
p162
aVWe put one on the back of the television set.
p163
aVBy the way, I do make it look a little bit easier than it is.
p164
aVThere's lots of electronics and secret sauce
p165
aVand all kinds of intellectual property that go into it.
p166
aVBut then what's going to happen is, it will create a field.
p167
aVIt will cause one to get created
p168
aVon the other side.
p169
aa(lp170
VAnd if the demo gods are willing,
p171
aVin about 10 seconds or so we should see it.
p172
aVThe 10 seconds actually are because we \u2014
p173
aVI don't know if any of you have ever thought about plugging a T.V. in
p174
aVwhen you use just a cord.
p175
aVGenerally, you have to go over and hit the button. So I thought
p176
aVwe put a little computer in it that has to wake up
p177
aVto tell it to do that.
p178
aVSo, I'll plug that in.
p179
aVIt creates a magnetic field here.
p180
aVIt causes one to be created out here.
p181
aVAnd as I said, in sort of about 10 seconds
p182
aVwe should start to see ...
p183
aa(lp184
VThis is a commercially \u2014
p185
aV(Applause)
p186
aVavailable color television set.
p187
aVImagine, you get one of these things. You want to hang them on the wall.
p188
aVHow many people want to hang them on the wall?
p189
aVThink about it. You don't want those ugly cords coming down.
p190
aVImagine if you can get rid of it.
p191
aa(lp192
VThe other thing I wanted to talk about was safety.
p193
aVSo, there is nothing going on. I'm okay.
p194
aVAnd I'll do it again, just for safety's sake.
p195
aVAlmost immediately, though, people ask,
p196
aV"How small can you make this? Can you make this small enough?"
p197
aVBecause remember Dr. Soljacic's original idea
p198
aVwas his wife's cellphone beeping.
p199
aa(lp200
VSo, I wanted to show you something.
p201
aVWe're an equal opportunity designer of this sort of thing.
p202
aVThis a Google G1.
p203
aVYou know, it's the latest thing that's come out.
p204
aVIt runs the Android operating system.
p205
aVI think I heard somebody talk about that before.
p206
aVIt's odd. It has a battery.
p207
aVIt also has coiled electronics
p208
aVthat WiTricity has put into the back of it.
p209
aVAnd if I can get the camera \u2014
p210
aVokay, great \u2014
p211
aVyou'll see, as I get sort of close...
p212
aVyou're looking at a cellphone powered completely wirelessly.
p213
aV(Applause)
p214
aa(lp215
VAnd I know some of you are Apple aficionados.
p216
aVSo, you know they don't make it easy at Apple to get inside their phones.
p217
aVSo we put a little sleeve on the back,
p218
aVbut we should be able to get this guy to wake up too.
p219
aVAnd those of you that have an iPhone recognize the green center.
p220
aV(Applause)
p221
aa(lp222
VAnd Nokia as well.
p223
aVYou'll see that what we did there is put a little thing in the back, to do that,
p224
aVand it probably beeps, actually, as it goes on as well.
p225
aVBut they typically use it to light up the screen.
p226
aVSo, imagine these things could go ... they could go in your ceiling.
p227
aVThey could go in the floor. They could go, actually, underneath your desktop.
p228
aVSo that when you walk in or you come in from home,
p229
aVif you carry a purse, it works in your purse.
p230
aVYou never have to worry about plugging these things in again.
p231
aVAnd think of what that would do for you.
p232
aa(lp233
VSo I think in closing,
p234
aVsort of in the immortal visions of The New Yorker magazine,
p235
aVI thought I'd put up one more slide.
p236
aVAnd for those of you who can't read it, it says,
p237
aV"It does appear to be some kind of wireless technology."
p238
aVSo, thank you very much.
