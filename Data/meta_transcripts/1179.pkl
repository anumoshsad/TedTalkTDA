VMy name is Emiliano Salinas
p4
aVand I'm going to talk about the role
p5
aVwe members of society play
p6
aVin the violent atmosphere
p7
aVthis country is living in right now.
p8
aVI was born in 1976.
p9
aVI grew up in a traditional Mexican family.
p10
aVAs a child, I had a pretty normal life:
p11
aVI would go to school, play with my friends and cousins.
p12
aVBut then my father became President of Mexico
p13
aVand my life changed.
p14
aa(lp15
VWhat I'm about to say,
p16
aVat least some of what I'm about to say,
p17
aVwill cause controversy.
p18
aVFirstly, because I'm the one who's going to say it.
p19
aVAnd secondly, because what I'm going to say is true,
p20
aVand it will make a lot of people nervous
p21
aVbecause it's something we don't want to hear.
p22
aVBut it's imperative that we listen
p23
aVbecause it's undeniable and definitive.
p24
aVIt will also make members of
p25
aVcriminal organizations nervous
p26
aVfor the same reasons.
p27
aVI'm going to talk about the role
p28
aVwe members of society play
p29
aVin this phenomenon,
p30
aVand about four different response levels
p31
aVwe citizens have against violence.
p32
aVI know many will find it difficult to separate the fact
p33
aVthat I'm Carlos Salinas de Gortari's son
p34
aVfrom the fact that I'm a citizen
p35
aVconcerned about the country's current situation.
p36
aVDon't worry.
p37
aVIt's not necessary for understanding
p38
aVthe importance of what I'm going to say.
p39
aa(lp40
VI think we have a problem in Mexico.
p41
aVWe have a big problem.
p42
aVI think there's consensus on this.
p43
aVNo one argues \u2014
p44
aVwe all agree there's a problem.
p45
aVWhat we don't agree on
p46
aVis what the problem actually is.
p47
aVIs it the Zetas? The drug traffickers? The government?
p48
aVCorruption? Poverty? Or is it something else?
p49
aVI think none of these is the problem.
p50
aVI don't mean they don't deserve attention.
p51
aVBut we won't be able to take care of any of those things
p52
aVif we don't solve the real problem
p53
aVwe have in Mexico first.
p54
aa(lp55
VThe real problem we have is
p56
aVmost of us Mexicans, we believe we are victims
p57
aVof our circumstances.
p58
aVWe are a country of victims.
p59
aVHistorically, we've always acted as victims
p60
aVof something or somebody.
p61
aVWe were victims of the Spaniards.
p62
aVThen we were victims of the French.
p63
aVThen we were victims of Don Porfirio.
p64
aVThen we were victims of the PRI.
p65
aVEven of Salinas.
p66
aVAnd of El Peje.
p67
aVAnd now of the Zetas and the traffickers and the criminals and the kidnappers ...
p68
aVHold on! Wait a minute!
p69
aVWhat if none of these things is the problem?
p70
aVThe problem is not the things we feel victims of.
p71
aVThe problem is that we play the role of victims.
p72
aVWe need to open our eyes and see that we are not victims.
p73
aVIf only we stopped feeling like victims,
p74
aVif we stopped acting as victims,
p75
aVour country would change so much!
p76
aa(lp77
VI'm going to talk about how to go from a society
p78
aVthat acts as a victim of circumstances
p79
aVto a responsible, involved society
p80
aVthat takes the future of its country in its own hands.
p81
aVI'm going to talk about four different levels
p82
aVof civil response against violence,
p83
aVfrom weakest
p84
aVto strongest.
p85
aVThe first level, the weakest level of civil response against violence,
p86
aVis denial and apathy.
p87
aVToday, much of Mexican society is in denial
p88
aVof the situation we're going through.
p89
aVWe want to go on with our daily life
p90
aVeven though we are not living under normal circumstances.
p91
aVDaily life in our country is,
p92
aVto say the least,
p93
aVunder extraordinary, exceptional circumstances.
p94
aVIt's like someone who has a serious illness
p95
aVand pretends it's the flu
p96
aVand it will just go away.
p97
aVWe want to pretend that Mexico has the flu.
p98
aVBut it doesn't.
p99
aVMexico has cancer.
p100
aVAnd if we don't do something about it,
p101
aVthe cancer will end up killing it.
p102
aa(lp103
VWe need to move Mexican society
p104
aVfrom denial and apathy
p105
aVto the next level of citizen response,
p106
aVwhich is, effectively, recognition.
p107
aVAnd that recognition will sow fear \u2014
p108
aVrecognizing the seriousness of the situation.
p109
aVBut, fear is better than apathy
p110
aVbecause fear makes us do something.
p111
aVMany people in Mexico
p112
aVare afraid today.
p113
aVWe're very afraid.
p114
aVAnd we're acting out of that fear.
p115
aVAnd let me tell you what the problem is
p116
aVwith acting out of fear \u2014
p117
aVand this is the second level of civil response:
p118
aVfear.
p119
aa(lp120
VLet's think about Mexican streets:
p121
aVthey're unsafe because of violence,
p122
aVso people stay at home.
p123
aVDoes that make streets more or less safe?
p124
aVLess safe!
p125
aVSo streets become more desolate and unsafe,
p126
aVso we stay home more \u2014
p127
aVwhich makes streets even more desolate and unsafe,
p128
aVand we stay home even more.
p129
aVThis vicious circle ends up with the whole population
p130
aVstuck inside their houses, scared to death \u2014
p131
aVeven more afraid than when we were out on the streets.
p132
aVWe need to confront this fear.
p133
aVWe need to move Mexican society,
p134
aVthe members of society who are at this level,
p135
aVto the next level, which is action.
p136
aa(lp137
VWe need to face our fears and take back our streets,
p138
aVour cities, our neighborhoods.
p139
aVFor many people, acting involves courage.
p140
aVWe go from fear to courage.
p141
aVThey say, "I can't take it anymore.
p142
aVLet's do something about it."
p143
aVRecently \u2014
p144
aVthis is a sensitive figure \u2014
p145
aV35 public lynchings have been recorded
p146
aVso far in 2010
p147
aVin Mexico.
p148
aVUsually it's one or two a year.
p149
aVNow we're experiencing one every week.
p150
aVThis shows that society is desperate
p151
aVand it's taking the law into its own hands.
p152
aVUnfortunately, violent action \u2014
p153
aVthough action is better than no action \u2014
p154
aVbut taking part in it
p155
aVonly disguises violence.
p156
aVIf I'm violent with you
p157
aVand you respond with violence,
p158
aVyou become part of the violence
p159
aVand you just disguise my violence.
p160
aa(lp161
VSo civil action
p162
aVis vital,
p163
aVbut it's also vital to take people
p164
aVwho are at the level of courage
p165
aVand violent action
p166
aVto the next level,
p167
aVwhich is non-violent action.
p168
aVIt's pacific, coordinated civil action,
p169
aVwhich doesn't mean passive action.
p170
aVIt means it's determined and effective,
p171
aVbut not violent.
p172
aVThere are examples of this kind of action in Mexico.
p173
aVTwo years ago, in Galena City, Chihuahua,
p174
aVa member of the community was kidnapped,
p175
aVEric Le Barón.
p176
aVHis brothers, Benjamín and Julián,
p177
aVgot together with the rest of the community
p178
aVto think of the best course of action:
p179
aVto pay the ransom,
p180
aVto take up arms and go after the kidnappers
p181
aVor to ask the government for help.
p182
aa(lp183
VIn the end, Benjamín and Julián decided
p184
aVthe best thing they could do
p185
aVwas to organize the community and act together.
p186
aVSo what did they do?
p187
aVThey mobilized the whole community of Le Barón
p188
aVto go to Chihuahua,
p189
aVwhere they organized a sit-in
p190
aVin the central park of the city.
p191
aVThey sent a message to the kidnappers:
p192
aV"If you want your ransom come and get it.
p193
aVWe'll be waiting for you right here."
p194
aVThey stayed there.
p195
aVSeven days later, Eric was set free
p196
aVand was able to return home.
p197
aVThis is an example of what an organized society can do,
p198
aVa society that acts.
p199
aa(lp200
VOf course, criminals can respond.
p201
aVAnd in this case, they did.
p202
aVOn July 7th, 2009,
p203
aVBenjamín Le Barón was murdered.
p204
aVBut Julián Le Barón keeps working
p205
aVand he has been mobilizing communities in Chihuahua
p206
aVfor over a year.
p207
aVAnd for over a year he has known that a price has been put on his head.
p208
aVBut he keeps fighting.
p209
aVHe keeps organizing.
p210
aVHe keeps mobilizing.
p211
aVThese heroic acts are present all over the country.
p212
aVWith a thousand Juliáns working together,
p213
aVMexico would be a very different country.
p214
aVAnd they're out there!
p215
aVThey just have to raise their hands.
p216
aVI was born in Mexico, I grew up in Mexico
p217
aVand along the way, I learned to love Mexico.
p218
aVI think anyone who has stepped foot on this land \u2014
p219
aVnot to mention all Mexican people \u2014
p220
aVwill agree that it's not difficult
p221
aVto love Mexico.
p222
aa(lp223
VI've traveled a lot
p224
aVand nowhere else have I found the passion Mexicans have.
p225
aVThat devotion we feel
p226
aVfor the national football team.
p227
aVThat devotion we show
p228
aVin helping victims of disasters,
p229
aVsuch as the earthquake in 1985
p230
aVor this year's floods.
p231
aVThe passion with which we've been singing the national anthem
p232
aVsince we were kids.
p233
aVWhen we thought Masiosare
p234
aVwas the strange enemy,
p235
aVand we sang, with a childlike heart,
p236
aV"a soldier in each son."
p237
aVI think the biggest insult,
p238
aVthe worst way you can offend a Mexican
p239
aVis to insult their mother.
p240
aVA mother is the most sacred thing in life.
p241
aVMexico is our mother and today she cries out for her children.
p242
aVWe are going through the darkest moment
p243
aVin our recent history.
p244
aVOur mother, Mexico, is being violated before our very eyes.
p245
aVWhat are we going to do?
p246
aVMasiosare, the strange enemy, is here.
p247
aVWhere is the soldier in each son?
p248
aa(lp249
VMahatma Gandhi,
p250
aVone of the greatest civil fighters of all time, said,
p251
aV"Be the change you wish to see in the world."
p252
aVToday in Mexico we're asking for Gandhis.
p253
aVWe need Gandhis.
p254
aVWe need men and women who love Mexico
p255
aVand who are willing to take action.
p256
aVThis is a call for every true Mexican
p257
aVto join this initiative.
p258
aVThis is a call
p259
aVso that every single thing we love about Mexico \u2014
p260
aVthe festivals, the markets,
p261
aVthe restaurants, the cantinas,
p262
aVthe tequila, the mariachis, the serenades,
p263
aVthe posadas, El Grito, the Day of the Dead,
p264
aVSan Miguel, the joy, the passion for life,
p265
aVthe fight and everything it means to be Mexican \u2014
p266
aVdoesn't disappear from this world.
p267
aa(lp268
VWe're facing a very powerful opponent.
p269
aVBut we are many more.
p270
aVThey can take a man's life.
p271
aVAnyone can kill me,
p272
aVor you, or you.
p273
aVBut no one can kill
p274
aVthe spirit of true Mexicans.
p275
aVThe battle is won,
p276
aVbut we still have to fight it.
p277
aV2000 years ago, the Roman poet Juvenal
p278
aVsaid something that today echoes
p279
aVin the heart of every true Mexican.
p280
aVHe said, "Count it the greatest sin
p281
aVto prefer life to honor,
p282
aVand for the sake of living
p283
aVto lose what makes life worth living."
p284
aVThank you.
