VHello, everybody.
p4
aVI brought with me today a baby diaper.
p5
aVYou'll see why in a second.
p6
aVBaby diapers have interesting properties.
p7
aVThey can swell enormously when you add water to them,
p8
aVan experiment done by millions of kids every day.
p9
aa(lp10
V(Laughter)
p11
aa(lp12
VBut the reason why
p13
aVis that they're designed in a very clever way.
p14
aVThey're made out of a thing called a swellable material.
p15
aVIt's a special kind of material that, when you add water,
p16
aVit will swell up enormously,
p17
aVmaybe a thousand times in volume.
p18
aVAnd this is a very useful, industrial kind of polymer.
p19
aVBut what we're trying to do in my group at MIT
p20
aVis to figure out if we can do something similar to the brain.
p21
aVCan we make it bigger,
p22
aVbig enough that you can peer inside
p23
aVand see all the tiny building blocks, the biomolecules,
p24
aVhow they're organized in three dimensions,
p25
aVthe structure, the ground truth structure of the brain, if you will?
p26
aVIf we could get that,
p27
aVmaybe we could have a better understanding of how the brain is organized
p28
aVto yield thoughts and emotions
p29
aVand actions and sensations.
p30
aVMaybe we could try to pinpoint the exact changes in the brain
p31
aVthat result in diseases,
p32
aVdiseases like Alzheimer's and epilepsy and Parkinson's,
p33
aVfor which there are few treatments, much less cures,
p34
aVand for which, very often, we don't know the cause or the origins
p35
aVand what's really causing them to occur.
p36
aVNow, our group at MIT
p37
aVis trying to take a different point of view
p38
aVfrom the way neuroscience has been done over the last hundred years.
p39
aVWe're designers. We're inventors.
p40
aVWe're trying to figure out how to build technologies
p41
aVthat let us look at and repair the brain.
p42
aVAnd the reason is,
p43
aVthe brain is incredibly, incredibly complicated.
p44
aa(lp45
VSo what we've learned over the first century of neuroscience
p46
aVis that the brain is a very complicated network,
p47
aVmade out of very specialized cells called neurons
p48
aVwith very complex geometries,
p49
aVand electrical currents will flow through these complexly shaped neurons.
p50
aVFurthermore, neurons are connected in networks.
p51
aVThey're connected by little junctions called synapses that exchange chemicals
p52
aVand allow the neurons to talk to each other.
p53
aVThe density of the brain is incredible.
p54
aVIn a cubic millimeter of your brain,
p55
aVthere are about 100,000 of these neurons
p56
aVand maybe a billion of those connections.
p57
aVBut it's worse.
p58
aVSo, if you could zoom in to a neuron,
p59
aVand, of course, this is just our artist's rendition of it.
p60
aVWhat you would see are thousands and thousands of kinds of biomolecules,
p61
aVlittle nanoscale machines organized in complex, 3D patterns,
p62
aVand together they mediate those electrical pulses,
p63
aVthose chemical exchanges that allow neurons to work together
p64
aVto generate things like thoughts and feelings and so forth.
p65
aa(lp66
VNow, we don't know how the neurons in the brain are organized
p67
aVto form networks,
p68
aVand we don't know how the biomolecules are organized
p69
aVwithin neurons
p70
aVto form these complex, organized machines.
p71
aVIf we really want to understand this,
p72
aVwe're going to need new technologies.
p73
aVBut if we could get such maps,
p74
aVif we could look at the organization of molecules and neurons
p75
aVand neurons and networks,
p76
aVmaybe we could really understand how the brain conducts information
p77
aVfrom sensory regions,
p78
aVmixes it with emotion and feeling,
p79
aVand generates our decisions and actions.
p80
aVMaybe we could pinpoint the exact set of molecular changes that occur
p81
aVin a brain disorder.
p82
aVAnd once we know how those molecules have changed,
p83
aVwhether they've increased in number or changed in pattern,
p84
aVwe could use those as targets for new drugs,
p85
aVfor new ways of delivering energy into the brain
p86
aVin order to repair the brain computations that are afflicted
p87
aVin patients who suffer from brain disorders.
p88
aa(lp89
VWe've all seen lots of different technologies over the last century
p90
aVto try to confront this.
p91
aVI think we've all seen brain scans
p92
aVtaken using MRI machines.
p93
aVThese, of course, have the great power that they are noninvasive,
p94
aVthey can be used on living human subjects.
p95
aVBut also, they're spatially crude.
p96
aVEach of these blobs that you see, or voxels, as they're called,
p97
aVcan contain millions and millions of neurons.
p98
aVSo it's not at the level of resolution
p99
aVwhere it can pinpoint the molecular changes that occur
p100
aVor the changes in the wiring of these networks
p101
aVthat contributes to our ability to be conscious and powerful beings.
p102
aa(lp103
VAt the other extreme, you have microscopes.
p104
aVMicroscopes, of course, will use light to look at little tiny things.
p105
aVFor centuries, they've been used to look at things like bacteria.
p106
aVFor neuroscience,
p107
aVmicroscopes are actually how neurons were discovered in the first place,
p108
aVabout 130 years ago.
p109
aVBut light is fundamentally limited.
p110
aVYou can't see individual molecules with a regular old microscope.
p111
aVYou can't look at these tiny connections.
p112
aVSo if we want to make our ability to see the brain more powerful,
p113
aVto get down to the ground truth structure,
p114
aVwe're going to need to have even better technologies.
p115
aa(lp116
VMy group, a couple years ago, started thinking:
p117
aVWhy don't we do the opposite?
p118
aVIf it's so darn complicated to zoom in to the brain,
p119
aVwhy can't we make the brain bigger?
p120
aVIt initially started
p121
aVwith two grad students in my group, Fei Chen and Paul Tillberg.
p122
aVNow many others in my group are helping with this process.
p123
aVWe decided to try to figure out if we could take polymers,
p124
aVlike the stuff in the baby diaper,
p125
aVand install it physically within the brain.
p126
aVIf we could do it just right, and you add water,
p127
aVyou can potentially blow the brain up
p128
aVto where you could distinguish those tiny biomolecules from each other.
p129
aVYou would see those connections and get maps of the brain.
p130
aVThis could potentially be quite dramatic.
p131
aa(lp132
VWe brought a little demo here.
p133
aVWe got some purified baby diaper material.
p134
aVIt's much easier just to buy it off the Internet
p135
aVthan to extract the few grains that actually occur in these diapers.
p136
aVI'm going to put just one teaspoon here
p137
aVof this purified polymer.
p138
aVAnd here we have some water.
p139
aVWhat we're going to do
p140
aVis see if this teaspoon of the baby diaper material
p141
aVcan increase in size.
p142
aVYou're going to see it increase in volume by about a thousandfold
p143
aVbefore your very eyes.
p144
aVI could pour much more of this in there,
p145
aVbut I think you've got the idea
p146
aVthat this is a very, very interesting molecule,
p147
aVand if can use it in the right way,
p148
aVwe might be able to really zoom in on the brain
p149
aVin a way that you can't do with past technologies.
p150
aa(lp151
VOK. So a little bit of chemistry now.
p152
aVWhat's going on in the baby diaper polymer?
p153
aVIf you could zoom in,
p154
aVit might look something like what you see on the screen.
p155
aVPolymers are chains of atoms arranged in long, thin lines.
p156
aVThe chains are very tiny,
p157
aVabout the width of a biomolecule,
p158
aVand these polymers are really dense.
p159
aVThey're separated by distances
p160
aVthat are around the size of a biomolecule.
p161
aVThis is very good
p162
aVbecause we could potentially move everything apart in the brain.
p163
aVIf we add water, what will happen is,
p164
aVthis swellable material is going to absorb the water,
p165
aVthe polymer chains will move apart from each other,
p166
aVand the entire material is going to become bigger.
p167
aVAnd because these chains are so tiny
p168
aVand spaced by biomolecular distances,
p169
aVwe could potentially blow up the brain
p170
aVand make it big enough to see.
p171
aa(lp172
VHere's the mystery, then:
p173
aVHow do we actually make these polymer chains inside the brain
p174
aVso we can move all the biomolecules apart?
p175
aVIf we could do that,
p176
aVmaybe we could get ground truth maps of the brain.
p177
aVWe could look at the wiring.
p178
aVWe can peer inside and see the molecules within.
p179
aVTo explain this, we made some animations
p180
aVwhere we actually look at, in these artist renderings,
p181
aVwhat biomolecules might look like and how we might separate them.
p182
aVStep one: what we'd have to do, first of all,
p183
aVis attach every biomolecule, shown in brown here,
p184
aVto a little anchor, a little handle.
p185
aVWe need to pull the molecules of the brain apart from each other,
p186
aVand to do that, we need to have a little handle
p187
aVthat allows those polymers to bind to them
p188
aVand to exert their force.
p189
aa(lp190
VNow, if you just take baby diaper polymer and dump it on the brain,
p191
aVobviously, it's going to sit there on top.
p192
aVSo we need to find a way to make the polymers inside.
p193
aVAnd this is where we're really lucky.
p194
aVIt turns out, you can get the building blocks,
p195
aVmonomers, as they're called,
p196
aVand if you let them go into the brain
p197
aVand then trigger the chemical reactions,
p198
aVyou can get them to form those long chains,
p199
aVright there inside the brain tissue.
p200
aVThey're going to wind their way around biomolecules
p201
aVand between biomolecules,
p202
aVforming those complex webs
p203
aVthat will allow you, eventually, to pull apart the molecules
p204
aVfrom each other.
p205
aVAnd every time one of those little handles is around,
p206
aVthe polymer will bind to the handle, and that's exactly what we need
p207
aVin order to pull the molecules apart from each other.
p208
aa(lp209
VAll right, the moment of truth.
p210
aVWe have to treat this specimen
p211
aVwith a chemical to kind of loosen up all the molecules from each other,
p212
aVand then, when we add water,
p213
aVthat swellable material is going to start absorbing the water,
p214
aVthe polymer chains will move apart,
p215
aVbut now, the biomolecules will come along for the ride.
p216
aVAnd much like drawing a picture on a balloon,
p217
aVand then you blow up the balloon,
p218
aVthe image is the same,
p219
aVbut the ink particles have moved away from each other.
p220
aVAnd that's what we've been able to do now, but in three dimensions.
p221
aa(lp222
VThere's one last trick.
p223
aVAs you can see here,
p224
aVwe've color-coded all the biomolecules brown.
p225
aVThat's because they all kind of look the same.
p226
aVBiomolecules are made out of the same atoms,
p227
aVbut just in different orders.
p228
aVSo we need one last thing
p229
aVin order to make them visible.
p230
aVWe have to bring in little tags,
p231
aVwith glowing dyes that will distinguish them.
p232
aVSo one kind of biomolecule might get a blue color.
p233
aVAnother kind of biomolecule might get a red color.
p234
aVAnd so forth.
p235
aVAnd that's the final step.
p236
aVNow we can look at something like a brain
p237
aVand look at the individual molecules,
p238
aVbecause we've moved them far apart enough from each other
p239
aVthat we can tell them apart.
p240
aa(lp241
VSo the hope here is that we can make the invisible visible.
p242
aVWe can turn things that might seem small and obscure
p243
aVand blow them up
p244
aVuntil they're like constellations of information about life.
p245
aVHere's an actual video of what it might look like.
p246
aVWe have here a little brain in a dish \u2014
p247
aVa little piece of a brain, actually.
p248
aVWe've infused the polymer in,
p249
aVand now we're adding water.
p250
aVWhat you'll see is that, right before your eyes \u2014
p251
aVthis video is sped up about sixtyfold \u2014
p252
aVthis little piece of brain tissue is going to grow.
p253
aVIt can increase by a hundredfold or even more in volume.
p254
aVAnd the cool part is, because those polymers are so tiny,
p255
aVwe're separating biomolecules evenly from each other.
p256
aVIt's a smooth expansion.
p257
aVWe're not losing the configuration of the information.
p258
aVWe're just making it easier to see.
p259
aa(lp260
VSo now we can take actual brain circuitry \u2014
p261
aVhere's a piece of the brain involved with, for example, memory \u2014
p262
aVand we can zoom in.
p263
aVWe can start to actually look at how circuits are configured.
p264
aVMaybe someday we could read out a memory.
p265
aVMaybe we could actually look at how circuits are configured
p266
aVto process emotions,
p267
aVhow the actual wiring of our brain is organized
p268
aVin order to make us who we are.
p269
aVAnd of course, we can pinpoint, hopefully,
p270
aVthe actual problems in the brain at a molecular level.
p271
aVWhat if we could actually look into cells in the brain
p272
aVand figure out, wow, here are the 17 molecules that have altered
p273
aVin this brain tissue that has been undergoing epilepsy
p274
aVor changing in Parkinson's disease
p275
aVor otherwise being altered?
p276
aVIf we get that systematic list of things that are going wrong,
p277
aVthose become our therapeutic targets.
p278
aVWe can build drugs that bind those.
p279
aVWe can maybe aim energy at different parts of the brain
p280
aVin order to help people with Parkinson's or epilepsy
p281
aVor other conditions that affect over a billion people
p282
aVaround the world.
p283
aa(lp284
VNow, something interesting has been happening.
p285
aVIt turns out that throughout biomedicine,
p286
aVthere are other problems that expansion might help with.
p287
aVThis is an actual biopsy from a human breast cancer patient.
p288
aVIt turns out that if you look at cancers,
p289
aVif you look at the immune system,
p290
aVif you look at aging, if you look at development \u2014
p291
aVall these processes are involving large-scale biological systems.
p292
aVBut of course, the problems begin with those little nanoscale molecules,
p293
aVthe machines that make the cells and the organs in our body tick.
p294
aVSo what we're trying to do now is to figure out
p295
aVif we can actually use this technology to map the building blocks of life
p296
aVin a wide variety of diseases.
p297
aVCan we actually pinpoint the molecular changes in a tumor
p298
aVso that we can actually go after it in a smart way
p299
aVand deliver drugs that might wipe out exactly the cells that we want to?
p300
aa(lp301
VYou know, a lot of medicine is very high risk.
p302
aVSometimes, it's even guesswork.
p303
aVMy hope is we can actually turn what might be a high-risk moon shot
p304
aVinto something that's more reliable.
p305
aVIf you think about the original moon shot,
p306
aVwhere they actually landed on the moon,
p307
aVit was based on solid science.
p308
aVWe understood gravity;
p309
aVwe understood aerodynamics.
p310
aVWe knew how to build rockets.
p311
aVThe science risk was under control.
p312
aVIt was still a great, great feat of engineering.
p313
aVBut in medicine, we don't necessarily have all the laws.
p314
aVDo we have all the laws that are analogous to gravity,
p315
aVthat are analogous to aerodynamics?
p316
aVI would argue that with technologies
p317
aVlike the kinds I'm talking about today,
p318
aVmaybe we can actually derive those.
p319
aVWe can map the patterns that occur in living systems,
p320
aVand figure out how to overcome the diseases that plague us.
p321
aa(lp322
VYou know, my wife and I have two young kids,
p323
aVand one of my hopes as a bioengineer is to make life better for them
p324
aVthan it currently is for us.
p325
aVAnd my hope is, if we can turn biology and medicine
p326
aVfrom these high-risk endeavors that are governed by chance and luck,
p327
aVand make them things that we win by skill and hard work,
p328
aVthen that would be a great advance.
p329
