VHans Rosling: I'm going to ask you
p4
aVthree multiple choice questions.
p5
aVUse this device. Use this device to answer.
p6
aVThe first question is, how did the number
p7
aVof deaths per year
p8
aVfrom natural disaster,
p9
aVhow did that change during the last century?
p10
aVDid it more than double,
p11
aVdid it remain about the same in the world as a whole,
p12
aVor did it decrease to less than half?
p13
aVPlease answer A, B or C.
p14
aVI see lots of answers. This is much faster than I do it at universities.
p15
aVThey are so slow. They keep thinking, thinking, thinking.
p16
aVOh, very, very good.
p17
aa(lp18
VAnd we go to the next question.
p19
aVSo how long did women 30 years old
p20
aVin the world go to school:
p21
aVseven years, five years or three years?
p22
aVA, B or C? Please answer.
p23
aa(lp24
VAnd we go to the next question.
p25
aVIn the last 20 years, how did the percentage
p26
aVof people in the world
p27
aVwho live in extreme poverty change?
p28
aVExtreme poverty \u2014 not having  enough food for the day.
p29
aVDid it almost double,
p30
aVdid it remain more or less the same,
p31
aVor did it halve?
p32
aVA, B or C?
p33
aa(lp34
VNow, answers.
p35
aVYou see,
p36
aVdeaths from natural disasters in the world,
p37
aVyou can see it from this graph here,
p38
aVfrom 1900 to 2000.
p39
aVIn 1900, there was about half a million people
p40
aVwho died every year from natural disasters:
p41
aVfloods, earthquakes, volcanic  eruption, whatever, droughts.
p42
aVAnd then, how did that change?
p43
aa(lp44
VGapminder asked the public in Sweden.
p45
aVThis is how they answered.
p46
aVThe Swedish public answered like this:
p47
aVFifty percent thought it had doubled,
p48
aV38 percent said it's more or less the same,
p49
aV12 said it had halved.
p50
aVThis is the best data from the disaster researchers,
p51
aVand it goes up and down,
p52
aVand it goes to the Second World War,
p53
aVand after that it starts to fall and it keeps falling
p54
aVand it's down to much less than half.
p55
aVThe world has been much, much more capable
p56
aVas the decades go by
p57
aVto protect people from this, you know.
p58
aVSo only 12 percent of the Swedes know this.
p59
aa(lp60
VSo I went to the zoo and I asked the chimps.
p61
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p62
aVThe chimps don't watch the evening news,
p63
aVso the chimps,
p64
aVthey choose by random, so the Swedes answer worse than random.
p65
aVNow how did you do?
p66
aVThat's you.
p67
aVYou were beaten by the chimps.
p68
aV(Laughter)
p69
aVBut it was close.
p70
aVYou were three times better than the Swedes,
p71
aVbut that's not enough.
p72
aVYou shouldn't compare yourself to Swedes.
p73
aVYou must have higher ambitions in the world.
p74
aa(lp75
VLet's look at the next answer here: women in school.
p76
aVHere, you can see men went eight years.
p77
aVHow long did women go to school?
p78
aVWell, we asked the Swedes like this,
p79
aVand that gives you a hint, doesn't it?
p80
aVThe right answer is probably the one
p81
aVthe fewest Swedes picked, isn't it?
p82
aV(Laughter)
p83
aVLet's see, let's see. Here we come.
p84
aVYes, yes, yes, women have almost caught up.
p85
aVThis is the U.S. public.
p86
aVAnd this is you. Here you come.
p87
aVOoh.
p88
aVWell, congratulations, you're twice as good as the Swedes,
p89
aVbut you don't need me \u2014
p90
aa(lp91
VSo how come? I think it's like this,
p92
aVthat everyone is aware that there are countries
p93
aVand there are areas
p94
aVwhere girls have great difficulties.
p95
aVThey are stopped when they go to school,
p96
aVand it's disgusting.
p97
aVBut in the majority of the world,
p98
aVwhere most people in the world live,
p99
aVmost countries, girls today go to school
p100
aVas long as boys, more or less.
p101
aVThat doesn't mean that gender equity is achieved,
p102
aVnot at all.
p103
aVThey still are confined to terrible, terrible limitations,
p104
aVbut schooling is there in the world today.
p105
aVNow, we miss the majority.
p106
aVWhen you answer, you answer according to the worst places,
p107
aVand there you are right, but you miss the majority.
p108
aa(lp109
VWhat about poverty?
p110
aVWell, it's very clear that poverty here
p111
aVwas almost halved,
p112
aVand in U.S., when we asked the public,
p113
aVonly five percent got it right.
p114
aVAnd you?
p115
aVAh, you almost made it to the chimps.
p116
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p117
aVThat little, just a few of you!
p118
aVThere must be preconceived ideas, you know.
p119
aVAnd many in the rich countries,
p120
aVthey think that oh, we can never end extreme poverty.
p121
aVOf course they think so,
p122
aVbecause they don't even know what has happened.
p123
aVThe first thing to think about the future
p124
aVis to know about the present.
p125
aa(lp126
VThese questions were a few of the first ones
p127
aVin the pilot phase of the Ignorance Project
p128
aVin Gapminder Foundation that we run,
p129
aVand it was started, this project, last year
p130
aVby my boss, and also my son, Ola Rosling. (Laughter)
p131
aVHe's cofounder and director,
p132
aVand he wanted, Ola told me
p133
aVwe have to be more systematic
p134
aVwhen we fight devastating ignorance.
p135
aVSo already the pilots reveal this,
p136
aVthat so many in the public score worse than random,
p137
aVso we have to think about preconceived ideas,
p138
aVand one of the main preconceived ideas
p139
aVis about world income distribution.
p140
aa(lp141
VLook here. This is how it was in 1975.
p142
aVIt's the number of people on each income,
p143
aVfrom one dollar a day \u2014
p144
aV(Applause)
p145
aVSee, there was one hump here,
p146
aVaround one dollar a day,
p147
aVand then there was one hump here
p148
aVsomewhere between 10 and 100 dollars.
p149
aVThe world was two groups.
p150
aVIt was a camel world, like a camel with two humps,
p151
aVthe poor ones and the rich ones,
p152
aVand there were fewer in between.
p153
aa(lp154
VBut look how this has changed:
p155
aVAs I go forward, what has changed,
p156
aVthe world population has grown,
p157
aVand the humps start to merge.
p158
aVThe lower humps merged with the upper hump,
p159
aVand the camel dies and we have a dromedary world
p160
aVwith one hump only.
p161
aVThe percent in poverty has decreased.
p162
aVStill it's appalling
p163
aVthat so many remain in extreme poverty.
p164
aVWe still have this group, almost a billion, over there,
p165
aVbut that can be ended now.
p166
aa(lp167
VThe challenge we have now
p168
aVis to get away from that, understand where the majority is,
p169
aVand that is very clearly shown in this question.
p170
aVWe asked, what is the percentage of the world's
p171
aVone-year-old children who have got those
p172
aVbasic vaccines against measles and other things
p173
aVthat we have had for many years:
p174
aV20, 50 or 80 percent?
p175
aVNow, this is what the U.S. public and the Swedish answered.
p176
aVLook at the Swedish result:
p177
aVyou know what the right answer is.
p178
aV(Laughter)
p179
aVWho the heck is a professor of global health in that country?
p180
aVWell, it's me. It's me.
p181
aV(Laughter)
p182
aVIt's very difficult, this. It's very difficult.
p183
aV(Applause)
p184
aa(lp185
VHowever, Ola's approach
p186
aVto really measure what we know made headlines,
p187
aVand CNN published these results on their web
p188
aVand they had the questions there, millions answered,
p189
aVand I think there were about 2,000 comments,
p190
aVand this was one of the comments.
p191
aV"I bet no member of the media passed the test," he said.
p192
aa(lp193
VSo Ola told me, "Take these devices.
p194
aVYou are invited to media conferences.
p195
aVGive it to them and measure what the media know."
p196
aVAnd ladies and gentlemen,
p197
aVfor the first time, the informal results
p198
aVfrom a conference with U.S. media.
p199
aVAnd then, lately, from the European Union media.
p200
aV(Laughter)
p201
aVYou see, the problem is not that people
p202
aVdon't read and listen to the media.
p203
aVThe problem is that the media doesn't know themselves.
p204
aa(lp205
VWhat shall we do about this, Ola?
p206
aVDo we have any ideas?
p207
aV(Applause)
p208
aa(lp209
VOla Rosling: Yes, I have an idea, but first,
p210
aVI'm so sorry that you were beaten by the chimps.
p211
aVFortunately, I will be able to comfort you
p212
aVby showing why it was not your fault, actually.
p213
aVThen, I will equip you with some tricks
p214
aVfor beating the chimps in the future.
p215
aVThat's basically what I will do.
p216
aa(lp217
VBut first, let's look at why are we so ignorant,
p218
aVand it all starts in this place.
p219
aVIt's Hudiksvall. It's a city in northern Sweden.
p220
aVIt's a neighborhood where I grew up,
p221
aVand it's a neighborhood with a large problem.
p222
aVActually, it has exactly the same problem
p223
aVwhich existed in all the neighborhoods
p224
aVwhere you grew up as well.
p225
aVIt was not representative. Okay?
p226
aVIt gave me a very biased view
p227
aVof how life is on this planet.
p228
aVSo this is the first piece of the ignorance puzzle.
p229
aVWe have a personal bias.
p230
aa(lp231
VWe have all different experiences
p232
aVfrom communities and people we meet,
p233
aVand on top of this, we start school,
p234
aVand we add the next problem.
p235
aVWell, I like schools,
p236
aVbut teachers tend to teach outdated worldviews,
p237
aVbecause they learned something when they went to school,
p238
aVand now they describe this world to the students
p239
aVwithout any bad intentions,
p240
aVand those books, of course, that are printed
p241
aVare outdated in a world that changes.
p242
aVAnd there is really no practice
p243
aVto keep the teaching material up to date.
p244
aVSo that's what we are focusing on.
p245
aVSo we have these outdated facts
p246
aVadded on top of our personal bias.
p247
aa(lp248
VWhat happens next is news, okay?
p249
aVAn excellent journalist knows how to pick
p250
aVthe story that will make headlines,
p251
aVand people will read it because it's sensational.
p252
aVUnusual events are more interesting, no?
p253
aVAnd they are exaggerated,
p254
aVand especially things we're afraid of.
p255
aVA shark attack on a Swedish person
p256
aVwill get headlines for weeks in Sweden.
p257
aa(lp258
VSo these three skewed sources of information
p259
aVwere really hard to get away from.
p260
aVThey kind of bombard us
p261
aVand equip our mind with a lot of strange ideas,
p262
aVand on top of it we put the very thing
p263
aVthat makes us humans, our human intuition.
p264
aVIt was good in evolution.
p265
aVIt helped us generalize
p266
aVand jump to conclusions very, very fast.
p267
aVIt helped us exaggerate what we were afraid of,
p268
aVand we seek causality where there is none,
p269
aVand we then get an illusion of confidence
p270
aVwhere we believe that we are the best car drivers,
p271
aVabove the average.
p272
aVEverybody answered that question,
p273
aV"Yeah, I drive cars better."
p274
aa(lp275
VOkay, this was good evolutionarily,
p276
aVbut now when it comes to the worldview,
p277
aVit is the exact reason why it's upside down.
p278
aVThe trends that are increasing are instead falling,
p279
aVand the other way around,
p280
aVand in this case, the chimps use our intuition against us,
p281
aVand it becomes our weakness instead of our strength.
p282
aVIt was supposed to be our strength, wasn't it?
p283
aa(lp284
VSo how do we solve such problems?
p285
aVFirst, we need to measure it,
p286
aVand then we need to cure it.
p287
aVSo by measuring it we can understand
p288
aVwhat is the pattern of ignorance.
p289
aVWe started the pilot last year,
p290
aVand now we're pretty sure that we will encounter
p291
aVa lot of ignorance across the whole world,
p292
aVand the idea is really to
p293
aVscale it up to all domains
p294
aVor dimensions of global development,
p295
aVsuch as climate, endangered species, human rights,
p296
aVgender equality, energy, finance.
p297
aVAll different sectors have facts,
p298
aVand there are organizations trying to spread
p299
aVawareness about these facts.
p300
aVSo I've started actually contacting some of them,
p301
aVlike WWF and Amnesty International and UNICEF,
p302
aVand asking them, what are your favorite facts
p303
aVwhich you think the public doesn't know?
p304
aa(lp305
VOkay, I gather those facts.
p306
aVImagine a long list with, say, 250 facts.
p307
aVAnd then we poll the public
p308
aVand see where they score worst.
p309
aVSo we get a shorter list
p310
aVwith the terrible results,
p311
aVlike some few examples from Hans,
p312
aVand we have no problem finding these kinds
p313
aVof terrible results.
p314
aVOkay, this little shortlist, what are we going to do with it?
p315
aVWell, we turn it into a knowledge certificate,
p316
aVa global knowledge certificate,
p317
aVwhich you can use, if you're a large organization,
p318
aVa school, a university, or maybe a news agency,
p319
aVto certify yourself as globally knowledgeable.
p320
aVBasically meaning, we don't hire people
p321
aVwho score like chimpanzees.
p322
aVOf course you shouldn't.
p323
aVSo maybe 10 years from now,
p324
aVif this project succeeds,
p325
aVyou will be sitting in an interview
p326
aVhaving to fill out this crazy global knowledge.
p327
aa(lp328
VSo now we come to the practical tricks.
p329
aVHow are you going to succeed?
p330
aVThere is, of course, one way,
p331
aVwhich is to sit down late nights
p332
aVand learn all the facts by heart
p333
aVby reading all these reports.
p334
aVThat will never happen, actually.
p335
aVNot even Hans thinks that's going to happen.
p336
aVPeople don't have that time.
p337
aVPeople like shortcuts, and here are the shortcuts.
p338
aVWe need to turn our intuition into strength again.
p339
aVWe need to be able to generalize.
p340
aVSo now I'm going to show you some tricks
p341
aVwhere the misconceptions are turned around
p342
aVinto rules of thumb.
p343
aa(lp344
VLet's start with the first misconception.
p345
aVThis is very widespread.
p346
aVEverything is getting worse.
p347
aVYou heard it. You thought it yourself.
p348
aVThe other way to think is, most things improve.
p349
aVSo you're sitting with a question in front of you
p350
aVand you're unsure. You should guess "improve."
p351
aVOkay? Don't go for the worse.
p352
aVThat will help you score better on our tests.
p353
aV(Applause)
p354
aVThat was the first one.
p355
aa(lp356
VThere are rich and poor
p357
aVand the gap is increasing.
p358
aVIt's a terrible inequality.
p359
aVYeah, it's an unequal world,
p360
aVbut when you look at the data, it's one hump.
p361
aVOkay? If you feel unsure,
p362
aVgo for "the most people are in the middle."
p363
aVThat's going to help you get the answer right.
p364
aa(lp365
VNow, the next preconceived idea is
p366
aVfirst countries and people need to be very, very rich
p367
aVto get the social development
p368
aVlike girls in school and be ready for natural disasters.
p369
aVNo, no, no. That's wrong.
p370
aVLook: that huge hump in the middle
p371
aValready have girls in school.
p372
aVSo if you are unsure, go for the
p373
aV"the majority already have this,"
p374
aVlike electricity and girls in school, these kinds of things.
p375
aVThey're only rules of thumb,
p376
aVso of course they don't apply to everything,
p377
aVbut this is how you can generalize.
p378
aa(lp379
VLet's look at the last one.
p380
aVIf something, yes, this is a good one,
p381
aVsharks are dangerous.
p382
aVNo \u2014 well, yes, but they are not so important
p383
aVin the global statistics, that is what I'm saying.
p384
aVI actually, I'm very afraid of sharks.
p385
aVSo as soon as I see a question about things I'm afraid of,
p386
aVwhich might be earthquakes, other religions,
p387
aVmaybe I'm afraid of terrorists or sharks,
p388
aVanything that makes me feel,
p389
aVassume you're going to exaggerate the problem.
p390
aVThat's a rule of thumb.
p391
aVOf course there are dangerous  things that are also great.
p392
aVSharks kill very, very few. That's how you should think.
p393
aa(lp394
VWith these four rules of thumb,
p395
aVyou could probably answer better than the chimps,
p396
aVbecause the chimps cannot do this.
p397
aVThey cannot generalize these kinds of rules.
p398
aVAnd hopefully we can turn your world around
p399
aVand we're going to beat the chimps. Okay?
p400
aV(Applause)
p401
aVThat's a systematic approach.
p402
aa(lp403
VNow the question, is this important?
p404
aVYeah, it's important to understand poverty,
p405
aVextreme poverty and how to fight it,
p406
aVand how to bring girls in school.
p407
aVWhen we realize that actually it's succeeding, we can understand it.
p408
aVBut is it important for everyone else
p409
aVwho cares about the rich end of this scale?
p410
aVI would say yes, extremely important,
p411
aVfor the same reason.
p412
aVIf you have a fact-based worldview of today,
p413
aVyou might have a chance to understand
p414
aVwhat's coming next in the future.
p415
aa(lp416
VWe're going back to these two humps in 1975.
p417
aVThat's when I was born,
p418
aVand I selected the West.
p419
aVThat's the current EU countries and North America.
p420
aVLet's now see how the rest and the West compares
p421
aVin terms of how rich you are.
p422
aVThese are the people who can afford
p423
aVto fly abroad with an airplane for a vacation.
p424
aVIn 1975, only 30 percent of them lived
p425
aVoutside EU and North America.
p426
aVBut this has changed, okay?
p427
aVSo first, let's look at the change up till today, 2014.
p428
aVToday it's 50/50.
p429
aVThe Western domination is over, as of today.
p430
aVThat's nice. So what's going to happen next?
p431
aVDo you see the big hump? Did you see how it moved?
p432
aVI did a little experiment. I went to the IMF, International Monetary Fund, website.
p433
aVThey have a forecast for the next  five years of GDP per capita.
p434
aVSo I can use that to go five years into the future,
p435
aVassuming the income inequality  of each country is the same.
p436
aVI did that, but I went even further.
p437
aVI used those five years for the next 20 years
p438
aVwith the same speed, just as an  experiment what might actually happen.
p439
aVLet's move into the future.
p440
aVIn 2020, it's 57 percent in the rest.
p441
aVIn 2025, 63 percent.
p442
aV2030, 68. And in 2035, the West is  outnumbered in the rich consumer market.
p443
aVThese are just projections of  GDP per capita into the future.
p444
aVSeventy-three percent of the rich consumers
p445
aVare going to live outside North America and Europe.
p446
aVSo yes, I think it's a good idea for  a company to use this certificate
p447
aVto make sure to make fact- based decisions in the future.
p448
aa(lp449
