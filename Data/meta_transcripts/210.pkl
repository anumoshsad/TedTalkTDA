VI'm a contemporary artist and I show in art galleries and museums.
p4
aVI show a number of photographs and films,
p5
aVbut I also make television programs, books and some advertising,
p6
aVall with the same concept.
p7
aVAnd it's about our fixation with celebrity and celebrity culture,
p8
aVand the importance of the image:
p9
aVcelebrity is born of photography.
p10
aa(lp11
VI'm going to start with how I started with this concept seven years ago,
p12
aVwhen Princess Diana died.
p13
aVThere was a sort of a standstill in Britain
p14
aVthe moment of her death,
p15
aVand people decided to mourn her death in a sort of mass way.
p16
aVI was fascinated by this phenomenon,
p17
aVso I wondered:
p18
aVcould one erase the image of Diana, actually quite crudely and physically?
p19
aVSo, I got a gun and started to shoot at the image of Diana,
p20
aVbut I couldn't erase this from my memory
p21
aVand certainly it was not being erased from the public psyche.
p22
aVMomentum was being built.
p23
aVThe press wrote about her death in rather, I felt, pornographic ways \u2014
p24
aVlike, "Which bit of artery left which bit of body?"
p25
aVand "How did she die in the back of the car?" \u2014
p26
aVand I was intrigued by this sort of mass voyeurism,
p27
aVso I made these rather gory images.
p28
aa(lp29
VI then went on wondering whether I could actually replace her image,
p30
aVso I got a look-alike of Diana
p31
aVand posed her in the right positions and angles
p32
aVand created something that was in, or existed in, the public imagination.
p33
aVSo people were wondering: was she going to marry Dodi?
p34
aVWas she in love with him?
p35
aVWas she pregnant? Did she want his baby?
p36
aVWas she pregnant when she died?
p37
aVSo I created this image of Diana, Dodi and their imaginary mixed-race child
p38
aVand this image came out, which caused a huge public outcry at the time.
p39
aa(lp40
VI then went on to make more comments on the media and press imagery,
p41
aVso I started making reference to media imagery \u2014
p42
aVmade it grainy, shot through doorways and so on and so forth \u2014
p43
aVto titillate the public or the viewer further
p44
aVin terms of trying to make the viewer more aware of their own voyeurism.
p45
aVSo, this is an image of Diana looking at Camilla kissing her husband,
p46
aVand this was a sequence of images.
p47
aVAnd this gets shown in art galleries like this, as a sequence.
p48
aVAnd similarly with the Di-Dodian baby imagery \u2014
p49
aVthis is another art gallery installation.
p50
aa(lp51
VI'm particularly interested in how you can't rely on your own perception.
p52
aVThis is Jane Smith and Jo Bloggs, for instance,
p53
aVbut you think it's Camilla and the Queen,
p54
aVand I'm fascinated how what you think is real isn't necessarily real.
p55
aVAnd the camera can lie,
p56
aVand it makes it very, very easy
p57
aVwith the mass bombardment of imagery to tell untruths.
p58
aVSo, I continued to work on this project of how photography seduces us
p59
aVand is more interesting to look at than the actual real subject matter.
p60
aVAnd at the same time, it removes us from the real subject matter,
p61
aa(lp62
Vand this acts as a sort of titillating thing.
p63
aVSo, the photograph becomes this teaser and incites desire and voyeurism;
p64
aVwhat you can't have, you want more.
p65
aVIn the photograph, the real subject doesn't exist
p66
aVso it makes you want that person more.
p67
aVAnd that is the way, I think, that celebrity magazines work now:
p68
aVthe more pictures you see of these celebrities,
p69
aVthe more you feel you know them,
p70
aVbut you don't know them
p71
aVand you want to know them further.
p72
aa(lp73
VOf course, the Queen goes to her stud often to watch her horses ...
p74
aVwatch her horses. (Laughter).
p75
aVAnd then I was sort of making imagery.
p76
aVIn England there's an expression: "you can't imagine the Queen on the loo."
p77
aVSo I'm trying to penetrate that.
p78
aVWell, here is the image.
p79
aa(lp80
VAll this imagery was creating a lot of fuss
p81
aVand I was cited as a disgusting artist. The press were writing about this,
p82
aVgiving full pages about how terrible this was.
p83
aVWhich I found very interesting that it was going full cycle:
p84
aVI was making comments about the press
p85
aVand about how we know facts and information only by media \u2014
p86
aVbecause we don't know the real people;
p87
aVvery few of us know the real people \u2014
p88
aVbut it was going back into the press
p89
aVand they were publicizing, effectively, my filthy work.
p90
aVSo, these are broadsheets, tabloids, debates were being had all about this work,
p91
aVfilms were being banned before people had actually had the look at the work,
p92
aVpoliticians were getting involved \u2014
p93
aVall sorts of things \u2014 great headlines.
p94
aa(lp95
VThen suddenly, it started to get on front pages.
p96
aVI was being asked and paid to do front covers.
p97
aVSuddenly I was becoming sort of acceptable,
p98
aVwhich I found also fascinating.
p99
aVHow one moment \u2014 it was disgusting \u2014
p100
aVjournalists would lie to me to get a story or a photograph of me,
p101
aVsaying my work was wonderful,
p102
aVand the next minute there were terrible headlines about me.
p103
aVBut then this changed suddenly.
p104
aa(lp105
VI then started to work for magazines and newspapers.
p106
aVThis was, for example, an image that went into Tatler.
p107
aVThis was another newspaper image.
p108
aVIt was an April fool actually, and to this day some people think it's real.
p109
aVI was sitting next to someone at dinner the other day,
p110
aVand they were saying there's this great image of the Queen
p111
aVsitting outside William Hill.
p112
aVThey thought it was real.
p113
aa(lp114
VI was exploring, at the time, the hyperbole of icons \u2014
p115
aVand Diana and Marilyn \u2014 and the importance of celebrity in our lives.
p116
aVHow they wheedle their way into the collective psyche
p117
aVwithout us even knowing,
p118
aVand how that should happen.
p119
aVI explored with actually dressing up as the celebrities myself.
p120
aVThere's me as Diana \u2014
p121
aVI look like the mass murderer Myra Hindley, I think, in this one. (Laughter).
p122
aVAnd me as the Queen.
p123
aVI then continued on to make a whole body of work about Marilyn \u2014
p124
aVthe biggest icon of all \u2014
p125
aVand trying to titillate by shooting through doorways and shutters and so on and so forth,
p126
aVand only showing certain angles to create a reality that, obviously,
p127
aVis completely constructed.
p128
aVThis is the look-alike, so the crafting elements of this is completely enormous.
p129
aVShe looks nothing like Marilyn,
p130
aVbut by the time we've made her up and put wigs and makeup on,
p131
aVshe looks exactly like Marilyn,
p132
aVto the extent that her husband couldn't recognize her \u2014
p133
aVor recognize this look-alike \u2014 in these photographs,
p134
aVwhich I find quite interesting.
p135
aVSo, all this work is getting shown in art galleries.
p136
aVThen I made a book.
p137
aVI was also making a TV series for the BBC at the time.
p138
aVStills from the TV series went into this book.
p139
aa(lp140
VBut there was a real legal problem because it looks real,
p141
aVbut how do you get over that?
p142
aVBecause obviously it's making a comment about our culture right now:
p143
aVthat we can't tell what's real.
p144
aVHow do we know when we're looking at something whether it's real or not?
p145
aVSo, from my point of view, it's important to publish it,
p146
aVbut at the same time it does cause a confusion \u2014
p147
aVintentional on my behalf,
p148
aVbut problematic for any outlet that I'm working with.
p149
aVSo a big disclaimer is put on everything that I do,
p150
aVand I made narratives about all the European or Brit celebrities
p151
aVand comments about our public figures.
p152
aVYou know, what does Tony Blair get up to in private with his fashion guru?
p153
aVAnd also dealing with the perceptions that are put about
p154
aVBin Laden, Saddam Hussein, the links that were put about pre-Iraq war.
p155
aVAnd what is going to happen to the monarchy?
p156
aVBecause obviously the British public,
p157
aVI think, would prefer William to Charles on the throne.
p158
aa(lp159
VAnd it's that wish, or that desire, that I suppose I'm dealing with in my work.
p160
aVI'm not really interested in the celebrity themselves.
p161
aVI'm interested in the perception of the celebrity.
p162
aVAnd with some look-alikes, they are so good
p163
aVyou don't know whether they're real or not.
p164
aa(lp165
VI did an advertising campaign for Schweppes, which is Coca-Cola,
p166
aVand so that was very interesting in terms of the legalities.
p167
aVIt's highly commercial.
p168
aVBut it was a difficulty for me \u2014 because this is my artwork;
p169
aVshould I do advertising? \u2014 at the time.
p170
aVSo I made sure the work was not compromised in any way
p171
aVand that the integrity of the work remained the same.
p172
aVBut the meanings changed in the sense that with the logo on,
p173
aVyou're closing all the lines of interpretation down to selling a product
p174
aVand that's all you're doing.
p175
aVWhen you take the logo off, you're opening up the interpretations
p176
aVand making the work inconclusive,
p177
aVopposed to conclusive when you are advertising.
p178
aa(lp179
VThis image is quite interesting, actually,
p180
aVbecause I think we made it three years ago.
p181
aVAnd it's Camilla in her wedding dress, which, again,
p182
aVnearly got re-used now, recently prior to her wedding.
p183
aVTony Blair and Cherie. And again, the legalities \u2014 we had to be very careful.
p184
aVIt's obviously a very big commercial company, and so this little,
p185
aV"Shh \u2014 it's not really them,"
p186
aVwas put on the side of the imagery.
p187
aVAnd Margaret Thatcher visiting Jeffery Archer in jail.
p188
aa(lp189
VI then was asked by Selfridges to do a series of windows for them,
p190
aVso I built a sauna bath in one of their windows and created little scenes \u2014
p191
aVlive scenes with look-alikes inside the windows,
p192
aVand the windows were all steamed up.
p193
aVSo, it's Tony Blair reading and practicing his speech;
p194
aVI've got them doing yoga inside there with Carole Caplin;
p195
aVSven making out with Ulrika Jonsson, who he was having an affair with at that time.
p196
aVThis was a huge success for them
p197
aVbecause the imagery got shown in the press the day after
p198
aVin every single newspaper, broadsheets and tabloids.
p199
aVIt was a bit of a road stopper, which was problematic
p200
aVbecause the police kept on trying to clear away the crowds,
p201
aVbut huge fun \u2014 it was great for me to do a performance.
p202
aVAlso, people were taking photographs of this,
p203
aVso it was being texted around the world extremely quickly, all this imagery.
p204
aVAnd the press were interviewing, and I was signing my book. (Laughter).
p205
aa(lp206
VFurther imagery. I'm making a new book now with Taschen
p207
aVthat I'm working on really for a sort of global market \u2014
p208
aVmy previous book was only for the U.K. market \u2014
p209
aVthat I suppose it could be called humorous.
p210
aVI suppose I come from a sort of non-humorous background
p211
aVwith serious intent,
p212
aVand then suddenly my work is funny.
p213
aVAnd I think it doesn't really matter that my work is considered humorous, in a way;
p214
aVI think it's a way in for me to deal with the importance of imagery
p215
aVand how we read all our information through imagery.
p216
aVIt's an extremely fast way of getting information.
p217
aVIt's extremely difficult if it's constructed correctly,
p218
aVand there are techniques of constructing iconic imagery.
p219
aa(lp220
VThis image, for example, is sort of spot-on
p221
aVbecause it exactly sums up what Elton may be doing in private,
p222
aVand also what might be happening with Saddam Hussein, and George Bush
p223
aVreading the Koran upside-down.
p224
aVFor example, George Bush target practice \u2014
p225
aVshooting at Bin Laden and Michael Moore.
p226
aVAnd then you change the photograph he's shooting at,
p227
aVand it suddenly becomes rather grim and maybe less accessible. (Laughter).
p228
aVTony Blair being used as a mounting block,
p229
aVand Rumsfeld and Bush laughing with some Abu Ghraib photos behind,
p230
aVand the seriousness, or the intellect, of Bush.
p231
aVAnd also, commenting on the behind the scenes \u2014
p232
aVwell, as we know now \u2014 what goes on in prisons.
p233
aVAnd in fact, George Bush and Tony Blair
p234
aVare having great fun during all of this.
p235
aa(lp236
VAnd really commenting, you know,
p237
aVbased on the perception we have of the celebrities.
p238
aVWhat Jack Nicholson might be up to in his celebrity life,
p239
aVand the fact that he tried to ... he had a bit of road rage
p240
aVand golf-clubbed a driver the other day.
p241
aVI mean, it's extremely difficult to find these look-alikes,
p242
aVso I'm constantly going up to people in the street
p243
aVand trying to ask people to come
p244
aVand be in one of my photographs or films.
p245
aVAnd sometimes asking the real celebrity,
p246
aVmistaking them for someone who just looks like the real person,
p247
aVwhich is highly embarrassing. (Laughter).
p248
aa(lp249
VI've also been working with The Guardian on a topical basis \u2014
p250
aVa page a week in their newspaper \u2014
p251
aVwhich has been very interesting, working topically.
p252
aVSo, Jamie Oliver and school dinners;
p253
aVBush and Blair having difficulty getting alongside Muslim culture;
p254
aVthe whole of the hunting issue,
p255
aVand the royal family refusing to stop hunting;
p256
aVand the tsunami issues; and obviously Harry;
p257
aVBlair's views on Gordon Brown, which I find very interesting;
p258
aVCondi and Bush.
p259
aVThis image I've decided to show having a reservation about it.
p260
aVI made it a year ago. And just how meanings change,
p261
aVand there were a terrible thing that has happened,
p262
aVbut the fear is lurking around in our minds prior to that.
p263
aVThat's why this image was made one year ago,
p264
aVand what it means today.
p265
aVSo, I'll leave you with these clips to have a look. (Music)
