VMy big idea is a very, very small idea
p4
aVthat can unlock billions of big ideas
p5
aVthat are at the moment dormant inside us.
p6
aVAnd my little idea that will do that is sleep.

VThis is a room of type A women.
p13
aVThis is a room of sleep-deprived women.
p14
aVAnd I learned the hard way the value of sleep.
p15
aVTwo-and-a-half years ago, I fainted from exhaustion.
p16
aVI hit my head on my desk.
p17
aVI broke my cheekbone, I got five stitches on my right eye.
p18
aVAnd I began the journey of rediscovering the value of sleep.
p19
aVAnd in the course of that, I studied,
p20
aVI met with medical doctors, scientists,
p21
aVand I'm here to tell you
p22
aVthat the way to a more productive, more inspired, more joyful life
p23
aVis getting enough sleep.
p24
aa(lp25
V(Applause)
p26
aa(lp27
VAnd we women are going to lead the way
p28
aVin this new revolution, this new feminist issue.
p29
aVWe are literally going to sleep our way to the top \u2014 literally \u2014
p30
aa(lp31
V(Laughter)
p32
aa(lp33
V(Applause)
p34
aa(lp35
Vbecause unfortunately, for men,
p36
aVsleep deprivation has become a virility symbol.
p37
aVI was recently having dinner with a guy
p38
aVwho bragged that he had only gotten four hours sleep the night before.
p39
aVAnd I felt like saying to him \u2014 but I didn't say \u2014
p40
aVI felt like saying, "You know what? if you had gotten five,
p41
aVthis dinner would have been a lot more interesting."
p42
aa(lp43
V(Laughter)
p44
aa(lp45
VThere is now a kind of sleep deprivation one-upmanship.
p46
aVEspecially here in Washington, if you try to make a breakfast date,
p47
aVand you say, "How about eight o'clock?"
p48
aVthey're likely to tell you, "Eight o'clock is too late for me,
p49
aVbut that's OK, I can get a game of tennis in
p50
aVand do a few conference calls and meet you at eight."
p51
aVAnd they think that means they are so incredibly busy and productive,
p52
aVbut the truth is, they're not,
p53
aVbecause we, at the moment,
p54
aVhave had brilliant leaders in business, in finance, in politics,
p55
aVmaking terrible decisions.
p56
aVSo a high IQ does not mean that you're a good leader,
p57
aVbecause the essence of leadership is being able to see the iceberg
p58
aVbefore it hits the Titanic.
p59
aa(lp60
V(Laughter)
p61
aa(lp62
VAnd we've had far too many icebergs hitting our Titanics.
p63
aVIn fact, I have a feeling
p64
aVthat if Lehman Brothers was Lehman Brothers and Sisters,
p65
aVthey might still be around.
p66
aa(lp67
V(Laughter)
p68
aa(lp69
V(Applause)
p70
aa(lp71
VWhile all the brothers were busy just being hyper-connected 24/7,
p72
aVmaybe a sister would have noticed the iceberg,
p73
aVbecause she would have woken up
p74
aVfrom a seven-and-a-half- or eight-hour sleep,
p75
aVand have been able to see the big picture.
p76
aa(lp77
VSo as we are facing all the multiple crises
p78
aVin our world at the moment,
p79
aVwhat is good for us on a personal level,
p80
aVwhat's going to bring more joy, gratitude, effectiveness in our lives
p81
aVand be the best for our own careers,
p82
aVis also what is best for the world.
p83
aVSo I urge you to shut your eyes,
p84
aVand discover the great ideas that lie inside us;
p85
aVto shut your engines and discover the power of sleep.
p86
aa(lp87
VThank you.
