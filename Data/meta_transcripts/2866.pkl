VFrom the families who are fighting to maintain funding for public schools,
p14
aVthe tens of thousands of people who joined Occupy Wall Street
p15
aVor marched with Black Lives Matter
p16
aVto protest police brutality against African Americans,
p17
aVfamilies that join rallies,
p18
aVpro-life and pro-choice,
p19
aVthose of us who are afraid
p20
aVthat our friends and neighbors are going to be deported
p21
aVor that they'll be added to lists
p22
aVbecause they are Muslim,
p23
aVpeople who advocate for gun rights and for gun control
p24
aVand the millions of people who joined the women's marches
p25
aVall across the country this last January.
p26
aa(lp27
V(Applause)
p28
aa(lp29
VWe are all activists now,
p30
aVand that means that we all have something to worry about from surveillance.
p31
aVSurveillance means government collection and use
p32
aVof private and sensitive data about us.
p33
aVAnd surveillance is essential
p34
aVto law enforcement and to national security.
p35
aVBut the history of surveillance
p36
aVis one that includes surveillance abuses
p37
aVwhere this sensitive information has been used against people
p38
aVbecause of their race,
p39
aVtheir national origin,
p40
aVtheir sexual orientation,
p41
aVand in particular, because of their activism,
p42
aVtheir political beliefs.
p43
aa(lp44
VAbout 53 years ago,
p45
aVDr. Martin Luther King Jr. gave his "I have a dream" speech
p46
aVon the Mall in Washington.
p47
aVAnd today the ideas behind this speech of racial equality and tolerance
p48
aVare so noncontroversial
p49
aVthat my daughters study the speech in third grade.
p50
aVBut at the time,
p51
aVDr. King was extremely controversial.
p52
aVThe legendary and notorious FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover believed,
p53
aVor wanted to believe,
p54
aVthat the Civil Rights Movement was a Soviet communist plot
p55
aVintended to destabilize the American government.
p56
aVAnd so Hoover had his agents put bugs in Dr. King's hotel rooms,
p57
aVand those bugs picked up conversations between civil rights leaders
p58
aVtalking about the strategies and tactics of the Civil Rights Movement.
p59
aVThey also picked up sounds of Dr. King
p60
aVhaving sex with women who were not his wife,
p61
aVand J. Edgar Hoover saw the opportunity here
p62
aVto discredit and undermine the Civil Rights Movement.
p63
aVThe FBI sent a package of these recordings
p64
aValong with a handwritten note to Dr. King,
p65
aVand a draft of this note was found in FBI archives years later,
p66
aVand the letter said,
p67
aV"You are no clergyman and you know it.
p68
aVKing, like all frauds, your end is approaching."
p69
aVThe letter even seemed to encourage Dr. King to commit suicide,
p70
aVsaying, "King, there is only one thing left for you to do.
p71
aVYou know what it is.
p72
aVYou better take it before your filthy, abnormal, fraudulent self
p73
aVis bared to the nation."
p74
aa(lp75
VBut the important thing is,
p76
aVDr. King was not abnormal.
p77
aVEvery one of us has something that we want to hide from somebody.
p78
aVAnd even more important,
p79
aVJ. Edgar Hoover wasn't abnormal either.
p80
aVThe history of surveillance abuses
p81
aVis not the history of one bad, megalomaniacal man.
p82
aVThroughout his decades at the FBI,
p83
aVJ. Edgar Hoover enjoyed the support of the presidents that he served,
p84
aVDemocratic and Republican alike.
p85
aVAfter all, it was John F. Kennedy and his brother Robert Kennedy
p86
aVwho knew about and approved the surveillance of Dr. King.
p87
aVHoover ran a program called COINTELPRO for 15 years
p88
aVwhich was designed to spy on and undermine civic groups
p89
aVthat were devoted to things like civil rights,
p90
aVthe Women's Rights Movement,
p91
aVand peace groups and anti-war movements.
p92
aVAnd the surveillance didn't stop there.
p93
aVLyndon Baines Johnson,
p94
aVduring the election campaign,
p95
aVhad the campaign airplane of his rival Barry Goldwater bugged
p96
aVas part of his effort to win that election.
p97
aVAnd then, of course, there was Watergate.
p98
aVBurglars were caught
p99
aVbreaking into the Democratic National Committee headquarters
p100
aVat the Watergate Hotel,
p101
aVthe Nixon administration was involved in covering up the burglary,
p102
aVand eventually Nixon had to step down as president.
p103
aVCOINTELPRO and Watergate were a wake-up call for Americans.
p104
aVSurveillance was out of control
p105
aVand it was being used to squelch political challengers.
p106
aVAnd so Americans rose to the occasion
p107
aVand what we did was we reformed surveillance law.
p108
aVAnd the primary tool we used to reform surveillance law
p109
aVwas to require a search warrant
p110
aVfor the government to be able to get access to our phone calls and our letters.
p111
aVNow, the reason why a search warrant is important
p112
aVis because it interposes a judge
p113
aVin the relationship between investigators and the citizens,
p114
aVand that judge's job is to make sure
p115
aVthat there's good cause for the surveillance,
p116
aVthat the surveillance is targeted at the right people,
p117
aVand that the information that's collected
p118
aVis going to be used for legitimate government purposes
p119
aVand not for discriminatory ones.
p120
aVThis was our system,
p121
aVand what this means is
p122
aVthat President Obama did not wiretap Trump Tower.
p123
aVThe system is set up to prevent something like that from happening
p124
aVwithout a judge being involved.
p125
aa(lp126
VBut what happens when we're not talking about phone calls or letters anymore?
p127
aVToday, we have technology
p128
aVthat makes it cheap and easy for the government to collect information
p129
aVon ordinary everyday people.
p130
aVYour phone call records
p131
aVcan reveal whether you have an addiction,
p132
aVwhat your religion is,
p133
aVwhat charities you donate to,
p134
aVwhat political candidate you support.
p135
aVAnd yet, our government collected, dragnet-style,
p136
aVAmericans' calling records for years.
p137
aVIn 2012, the Republican National Convention
p138
aVhighlighted a new technology it was planning to use,
p139
aVfacial recognition,
p140
aVto identify people who were going to be in the crowd
p141
aVwho might be activists or troublemakers
p142
aVand to stop them ahead of time.
p143
aVToday, over 50 percent of American adults
p144
aVhave their faceprint in a government database.
p145
aVThe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives
p146
aVconcocted a plan
p147
aVto find out what Americans were going to gun shows
p148
aVby using license plate detectors
p149
aVto scan the license plates of cars
p150
aVthat were in the parking lots of these events.
p151
aVToday, we believe that over 70 percent of police departments
p152
aVhave automatic license plate detection technology
p153
aVthat they're using to track people's cars as they drive through town.
p154
aVAnd all of this information,
p155
aVthe license plates, the faceprints,
p156
aVthe phone records,
p157
aVyour address books, your buddy lists,
p158
aVthe photos that you upload to Dropbox or Google Photos,
p159
aVand sometimes even your chats and your emails
p160
aVare not protected by a warrant requirement.
p161
aVSo what that means is we have all of this information on regular people
p162
aVthat's newly available at very low expense.
p163
aVIt is the golden age for surveillance.
p164
aa(lp165
VNow, every parent is going to understand what this means.
p166
aVWhen you have a little baby
p167
aVand the baby's young,
p168
aVthat child is not able to climb out of its crib.
p169
aVBut eventually your little girl gets older
p170
aVand she's able to climb out of the crib,
p171
aVbut you tell her, "Don't climb out of the crib. OK?"
p172
aVAnd every parent knows what's going to happen.
p173
aVSome of those babies are going to climb out of the crib.
p174
aVRight? That's the difference between ability and permission.
p175
aVWell, the same thing is true with the government today.
p176
aVIt used to be that our government didn't have the ability
p177
aVto do widespread, massive surveillance on hundreds of millions of Americans
p178
aVand then abuse that information.
p179
aVBut now our government has grown up,
p180
aVand we have that technology today.
p181
aVThe government has the ability,
p182
aVand that means the law is more important than ever before.
p183
aVThe law is supposed to say
p184
aVwhen the government has permission to do it,
p185
aVand it's supposed to ensure that there's some kind of ramification.
p186
aVWe notice when those laws are broken
p187
aVand there's some of kind of ramification or punishment.
p188
aVThe law is more important than ever because we are now living in a world
p189
aVwhere only rules are stopping the government
p190
aVfrom abusing this information.
p191
aa(lp192
VBut the law has fallen down on the job.
p193
aVParticularly since September 11 the law has fallen down on the job,
p194
aVand we do not have the rules in place that we need.
p195
aVAnd we are seeing the ramifications of that.
p196
aVSo fusion centers are these joint task forces
p197
aVbetween local, state and federal government
p198
aVthat are meant to ferret out domestic terrorism.
p199
aVAnd what we've seen is fusion center reports
p200
aVthat say that you might be dangerous
p201
aVif you voted for a third-party candidate,
p202
aVor you own a "Don't Tread On Me" flag,
p203
aVor you watched movies that are anti-tax.
p204
aVThese same fusion centers have spied on Muslim community groups' reading lists
p205
aVand on Quakers who are resisting military recruiting in high schools.
p206
aVThe Internal Revenue Service has disproportionately audited
p207
aVgroups that have "Tea Party" or "Patriot" in their name.
p208
aVAnd now customs and border patrol
p209
aVis stopping people as they come into the country
p210
aVand demanding our social networking passwords
p211
aVwhich will allow them to see who our friends are,
p212
aVwhat we say
p213
aVand even to impersonate us online.
p214
aa(lp215
VNow, civil libertarians like myself
p216
aVhave been trying to draw people's attention to these things
p217
aVand fighting against them for years.
p218
aVThis was a huge problem during the Obama administration,
p219
aVbut now the problem is worse.
p220
aVWhen the New York Police Department
p221
aVspies on Muslims
p222
aVor a police department uses license plate detectors
p223
aVto find out where the officers' spouses are
p224
aVor those sorts of things,
p225
aVthat is extremely dangerous.
p226
aVBut when a president repurposes the power
p227
aVof federal surveillance and the federal government
p228
aVto retaliate against political opposition,
p229
aVthat is a tyranny.
p230
aVAnd so we are all activists now,
p231
aVand we all have something to fear from surveillance.
p232
aVBut just like in the time of Dr. Martin Luther King,
p233
aVwe can reform the way things are.
p234
aa(lp235
VFirst of all, use encryption.
p236
aVEncryption protects your information
p237
aVfrom being inexpensively and opportunistically collected.
p238
aVIt rolls back the golden age for surveillance.
p239
aa(lp240
VSecond, support surveillance reform.
p241
aVDid you know that if you have a friend
p242
aVwho works for the French or German governments
p243
aVor for an international human rights group
p244
aVor for a global oil company
p245
aVthat your friend is a valid foreign intelligence target?
p246
aVAnd what that means is that when you have conversations with that friend,
p247
aVthe US government may be collecting that information.
p248
aVAnd when that information is collected,
p249
aVeven though it's conversations with Americans,
p250
aVit can then be funneled to the FBI
p251
aVwhere the FBI is allowed to search through it
p252
aVwithout getting a warrant,
p253
aVwithout probable cause,
p254
aVlooking for information about Americans
p255
aVand whatever crimes we may have committed
p256
aVwith no need to document any kind of suspicion.
p257
aVThe law that allows some of this to happen
p258
aVis called Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act,
p259
aVand we have a great opportunity this year,
p260
aVbecause Section 702 is going to expire at the end of 2017,
p261
aVwhich means that Congress's inertia is on our side
p262
aVif we want reform.
p263
aVAnd we can pressure our representatives
p264
aVto actually implement important reforms to this law
p265
aVand protect our data from this redirection and misuse.
p266
aa(lp267
VAnd finally, one of the reasons why things have gotten so out of control
p268
aVis because so much of what happens with surveillance \u2014
p269
aVthe technology, the enabling rules and the policies
p270
aVthat are either there or not there to protect us \u2014
p271
aVare secret or classified.
p272
aVWe need transparency, and we need to know as Americans
p273
aVwhat the government is doing in our name
p274
aVso that the surveillance that takes place and the use of that information
p275
aVis democratically accounted for.
p276
aa(lp277
VWe are all activists now,
p278
aVwhich means that we all have something to worry about from surveillance.
p279
aVBut like in the time of Dr. Martin Luther King,
p280
aVthere is stuff that we can do about it.
p281
aVSo please join me, and let's get to work.
p282
aa(lp283
VThank you.
