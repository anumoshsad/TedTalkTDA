VThe narrative of a rising Africa is being challenged.
p4
aa(lp5
VAbout 10 years ago, I spoke about an Africa,
p6
aVan Africa of hope and opportunity,
p7
aVan Africa of entrepreneurs,
p8
aVan Africa very different from the Africa that you normally hear about
p9
aVof death, poverty and disease.
p10
aVAnd that what I spoke about,
p11
aVbecame part of what is known now as the narrative of the rising Africa.
p12
aa(lp13
VI want to tell you two stories about this rising Africa.
p14
aVThe first has to do with Rwanda,
p15
aVa country that has gone through many trials and tribulations.
p16
aVAnd Rwanda has decided to become the technology hub, or a technology hub
p17
aVon the continent.
p18
aVIt's a country with mountainous and hilly terrain,
p19
aVa little bit like here,
p20
aVso it's very difficult to deliver services to people.
p21
aVSo what has Rwanda said?
p22
aVIn order to save lives, it's going to try using drones
p23
aVto deliver lifesaving drugs, vaccines and blood
p24
aVto people in hard-to-reach places
p25
aVin partnership with a company called Zipline,
p26
aVwith UPS, and also with the Gavi, a global vaccine alliance.
p27
aVIn doing this, it will save lives.
p28
aVThis is part of the type of innovation we want to see in the rising Africa.
p29
aa(lp30
VThe second story has to do with something
p31
aVthat I'm sure most of you have seen or will remember.
p32
aVVery often, countries in Africa suffer drought and floods,
p33
aVand it's getting more frequent because of climate change effects.
p34
aVWhen this happens, they normally wait for international appeals to raise money.
p35
aVYou see pictures of children with flies on their faces,
p36
aVcarcasses of dead animals and so on.
p37
aVNow these countries, 32 countries, came together
p38
aVunder the auspices of the African Union
p39
aVand decided to form an organization called the African Risk Capacity.
p40
aVWhat does it do?
p41
aVIt's a weather-based insurance agency,
p42
aVand what these countries do is to pay insurance each year,
p43
aVabout 3 million dollars a year of their own resources,
p44
aVso that in the event they have a difficult drought situation or flood,
p45
aVthis money will be paid out to them,
p46
aVwhich they can then use to take care of their populations,
p47
aVinstead of waiting for aid to come.
p48
aVThe African Risk Capacity last year paid 26 million dollars
p49
aVto Mauritania, Senegal and Niger.
p50
aVThis enabled them to take care of 1.3 million people affected by drought.
p51
aVThey were able to restore livelihoods,
p52
aVbuy fodder for cattle, feed children in school
p53
aVand in short keep the populations home instead of migrating out of the area.
p54
aa(lp55
VSo these are the kinds of stories
p56
aVof an Africa ready to take responsibility for itself,
p57
aVand to look for solutions for its own problems.
p58
aVBut that narrative is being challenged now
p59
aVbecause the continent has not been doing well in the last two years.
p60
aVIt had been growing at five percent per annum
p61
aVfor the last one and a half decades,
p62
aVbut this year's forecast was three percent. Why?
p63
aVIn an uncertain global environment, commodity prices have fallen.
p64
aVMany of the economies are still commodity driven,
p65
aVand therefore their performance has slipped.
p66
aVAnd now the issue of Brexit doesn't make it any easier.
p67
aVI never knew that the Brexit could happen
p68
aVand that it could be one of the things that would cause global uncertainty
p69
aVsuch as we have.
p70
aa(lp71
VSo now we've got this situation,
p72
aVand I think it's time to take stock
p73
aVand to say what were the things that the African countries did right?
p74
aVWhat did they do wrong?
p75
aVHow do we build on all of this and learn lessons
p76
aVso that we can keep Africa rising?
p77
aa(lp78
VSo let me talk about six things that I think we did right.
p79
aVThe first is managing our economies better.
p80
aVThe '80s and '90s were the lost decades, when Africa was not doing well,
p81
aVand some of you will remember an "Economist" cover
p82
aVthat said, "The Lost Continent."
p83
aVBut in the 2000s, policymakers learned
p84
aVthat they needed to manage the macroeconomic environment better,
p85
aVto ensure stability,
p86
aVkeep inflation low in single digits,
p87
aVkeep their fiscal deficits low, below three percent of GDP,
p88
aVgive investors, both domestic and foreign,
p89
aVsome stability so they'll have confidence to invest in these economies.
p90
aVSo that was number one.
p91
aa(lp92
VTwo, debt.
p93
aVIn 1994, the debt-to-GDP ratio of African countries was 130 percent,
p94
aVand they didn't have fiscal space.
p95
aVThey couldn't use their resources to invest in their development
p96
aVbecause they were paying debt.
p97
aVThere may be some of you in this room who worked to support African countries
p98
aVto get debt relief.
p99
aVSo private creditors, multilaterals and bilaterals came together
p100
aVand decided to do the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative
p101
aVand give debt relief.
p102
aVSo this debt relief in 2005
p103
aVmade the debt-to-GDP ratio fall down to about 30 percent,
p104
aVand there was enough resources to try and reinvest.
p105
aa(lp106
VThe third thing was loss-making enterprises.
p107
aVGovernments were involved in business
p108
aVwhich they had no business being in.
p109
aVAnd they were running businesses, they were making losses.
p110
aVSo some of these enterprises were restructured,
p111
aVcommercialized, privatized or closed,
p112
aVand they became less of a burden on government.
p113
aa(lp114
VThe fourth thing was a very interesting thing.
p115
aVThe telecoms revolution came,
p116
aVand African countries jumped on it.
p117
aVIn 2000, we had 11 million phone lines.
p118
aVToday, we have about 687 million mobile lines on the continent.
p119
aVAnd this has enabled us
p120
aVto go, move forward with some mobile technology
p121
aVwhere Africa is actually leading.
p122
aVIn Kenya, the development of mobile money \u2014
p123
aVM-Pesa, which all of you have heard about \u2014
p124
aVit took some time for the world to notice that Africa was ahead
p125
aVin this particular technology.
p126
aVAnd this mobile money is also providing a platform
p127
aVfor access to alternative energy.
p128
aVYou know, people who can now pay for solar
p129
aVthe same way they pay for cards for their telephone.
p130
aVSo this was a very good development, something that went right.
p131
aa(lp132
VWe also invested more in education and health, not enough,
p133
aVbut there were some improvements.
p134
aV250 million children were immunized in the last one and a half decades.
p135
aa(lp136
VThe other thing was that conflicts decreased.
p137
aVThere were many conflicts on the continent.
p138
aVMany of you are aware of that.
p139
aVBut they came down, and our leaders even managed to dampen some coups.
p140
aVNew types of conflicts have emerged, and I'll refer to those later.
p141
aa(lp142
VSo based on all this, there's also some differentiation on the continent
p143
aVthat I want you to know about,
p144
aVbecause even as the doom and gloom is here,
p145
aVthere are some countries \u2014 Côte d'Ivoire, Kenya, Ethiopia,
p146
aVTanzania and Senegal are performing relatively well at the moment.
p147
aa(lp148
VBut what did we do wrong?
p149
aVLet me mention eight things.
p150
aVYou have to have more things wrong than right.
p151
aa(lp152
V(Laughter)
p153
aa(lp154
VSo there are eight things we did wrong.
p155
aVThe first was that even though we grew, we didn't create enough jobs.
p156
aVWe didn't create jobs for our youth.
p157
aVYouth unemployment on the continent is about 15 percent,
p158
aVand underemployment is a serious problem.
p159
aa(lp160
VThe second thing that we did is that the quality of growth was not good enough.
p161
aVEven those jobs we created were low-productivity jobs,
p162
aVso we moved people from low-productivity agriculture
p163
aVto low-productivity commerce and working in the informal sector
p164
aVin the urban areas.
p165
aa(lp166
VThe third thing is that inequality increased.
p167
aVSo we created more billionaires.
p168
aV50 billionaires worth 96 billion dollars
p169
aVown more wealth than the bottom 75 million people on the continent.
p170
aa(lp171
VPoverty,
p172
aVthe proportion of people in poverty \u2014 that's the fourth thing \u2014 did decrease,
p173
aVbut the absolute numbers did not because of population growth.
p174
aVAnd population growth is something
p175
aVthat we don't have enough of a dialogue about on the continent.
p176
aVAnd I think we will need to get a handle on it,
p177
aVparticularly how we educate girls.
p178
aVThat is the road to really working on this particular issue.
p179
aa(lp180
VThe fifth thing is that we didn't invest enough in infrastructure.
p181
aVWe had investment from the Chinese.
p182
aVThat helped some countries, but it's not enough.
p183
aVThe consumption of electricity in Africa on the continent
p184
aVin Sub-Saharan Africa is equivalent to Spain.
p185
aVThe total consumption is equivalent to that of Spain.
p186
aVSo many people are living in the dark,
p187
aVand as the President of the African Development Bank said recently,
p188
aVAfrica cannot develop in the dark.
p189
aa(lp190
VThe other thing we have not done
p191
aVis that our economies retain the same structure
p192
aVthat we've had for decades.
p193
aVSo even though we've been growing,
p194
aVthe structure of the economies has not changed very much.
p195
aVWe are still exporting commodities,
p196
aVand exporting commodities is what? It's exporting jobs.
p197
aVOur manufacturing value-added is only 11 percent.
p198
aVWe are not creating enough decent manufacturing jobs for our youth,
p199
aVand trade among ourselves is low.
p200
aVOnly about 12 percent of our trade is among ourselves.
p201
aVSo that's another serious problem.
p202
aa(lp203
VThen governance.
p204
aVGovernance is a serious issue.
p205
aVWe have weak institutions,
p206
aVand sometimes nonexistent institutions, and I think this gives way for corruption.
p207
aVCorruption is an issue that we have not yet gotten a good enough handle on,
p208
aVand we have to fight tooth and nail,
p209
aVthat and increased transparency in the way we manage our economies
p210
aVand the way we manage our finances.
p211
aa(lp212
VWe also need to be wary of new conflicts,
p213
aVnew types of conflicts,
p214
aVsuch as we have with Boko Haram in my country, Nigeria,
p215
aVand with Al-Shabaab in Kenya.
p216
aVWe need to partner with international partners,
p217
aVdeveloped countries, to fight this together.
p218
aVOtherwise, we create a new reality
p219
aVwhich is not the type we want for a rising Africa.
p220
aa(lp221
VAnd finally, the issue of education.
p222
aVOur education systems in many countries are broken.
p223
aVWe are not creating the types of skills needed for the future.
p224
aVSo we have to find a way to educate better.
p225
aVSo those are the things that we are not doing right.
p226
aa(lp227
VNow, where do we go from there?
p228
aVI believe that the way forward is to learn to manage success.
p229
aVVery often, when people succeed or countries succeed,
p230
aVthey forget what made them succeed.
p231
aVLearning what you're successful at,
p232
aVmanaging it and keeping it is vital for us.
p233
aVSo all those things I said we did right,
p234
aVwe have to learn to do it right again, keep doing it right.
p235
aVManaging the economy while creating stability is vital,
p236
aVgetting prices right, and policy consistency.
p237
aVVery often, we are not consistent.
p238
aVOne regime goes out, another comes in
p239
aVand they throw away even the functioning policies that were there before.
p240
aVWhat does this do?
p241
aVIt creates uncertainty for people, for households,
p242
aVuncertainties for business.
p243
aVThey don't know whether and how to invest.
p244
aa(lp245
VDebt: we must manage the success we had in reducing our debt,
p246
aVbut now countries are back to borrowing again,
p247
aVand we see our debt-to-GDP ratio beginning to creep up,
p248
aVand in certain countries,
p249
aVdebt is becoming a problem, so we have to avoid that.
p250
aVSo managing success.
p251
aa(lp252
VThe next thing is focusing with a laser beam
p253
aVon those things we did not do well.
p254
aVFirst and foremost is infrastructure.
p255
aVYes, most countries now recognize they have to invest in this,
p256
aVand they are trying to do the best they can to do that.
p257
aVWe must.
p258
aVThe most important thing is power.
p259
aVYou cannot develop in the dark.
p260
aa(lp261
VAnd then governance and corruption:
p262
aVwe have to fight.
p263
aVWe have to make our countries transparent.
p264
aVAnd above all, we have to engage our young people.
p265
aVWe have genius in our young people.
p266
aVI see it every day.
p267
aVIt's what makes me wake up in the morning and feel ready to go.
p268
aVWe have to unleash the genius of our young people,
p269
aVget out of their way, support them to create and innovate
p270
aVand lead the way.
p271
aVAnd I know that they will lead us in the right direction.
p272
aa(lp273
VAnd our women, and our girls:
p274
aVwe have to recognize that girls and women are a gift.
p275
aVThey have strength,
p276
aVand we have to unleash that strength
p277
aVso that they can contribute to the continent.
p278
aa(lp279
VI strongly believe that when we do all of these things,
p280
aVwe find that the rising Africa narrative
p281
aVis not a fluke.
p282
aVIt's a trend.
p283
aVIt's a trend, and if we continue, if we unleash our youth,
p284
aVif we unleash our women,
p285
aVwe may step backwards sometimes,
p286
aVwe may even step sideways,
p287
aVbut the trend is clear.
p288
aVAfrica will continue to rise.
p289
aa(lp290
VAnd I tell you businesspeople in the audience,
p291
aVinvestment in Africa is not for today, is not for tomorrow,
p292
aVit's not a short-term thing, it's a longer term thing.
p293
aVBut if you are not invested in Africa,
p294
aVthen you will be missing
p295
aVone of the most important emerging opportunities in the world.
p296
aa(lp297
VThank you.
p298
aa(lp299
V(Applause)
p300
aa(lp301
VKelly Stoetzel: So you mentioned corruption in your talk,
p302
aVand you're known, well-known as a strong anticorruption fighter.
p303
aVBut that's had consequences.
p304
aVPeople have fought back, and your mother was kidnapped.
p305
aVHow have you been handling this?
p306
aVNgozi Okonjo-Iweala: It's been very difficult.
p307
aVThank you for mentioning the issue of the kidnap of my mother.
p308
aVIt's a very difficult subject.
p309
aVBut what it means is that when you fight corruption,
p310
aVwhen you touch the pockets of people who are stealing money,
p311
aVthey don't just keep quiet.
p312
aVThey fight back, and the issue for you is when they try to intimidate you,
p313
aVdo you give up, or do you fight on?
p314
aVDo you find a way to stay on and fight back?
p315
aVAnd the answer that I had with the teams I worked with
p316
aVis we have to fight on.
p317
aVWe have to create those institutions.
p318
aVWe have to find ways to stop these people
p319
aVfrom taking away the heritage of the future.
p320
aVAnd so that's what we did.
p321
aVAnd even out of government, we continued to make that point.
p322
aVIn our countries, nobody, nobody is going to fight corruption
p323
aVfor us but us.
p324
aVAnd therefore, that comes with consequences,
p325
aVand we just have to do the best we can.
p326
aVBut I thank you and thank TED for giving us a voice
p327
aVto say to those people, you will not win,
p328
aVand we will not be intimidated.
p329
aa(lp330
VThank you.

V(Applause)
