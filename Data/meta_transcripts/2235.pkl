VWell, you know, sometimes
p4
aVthe most important things come in the smallest packages.
p5
aVI am going to try to convince you, in the 15 minutes I have,
p6
aVthat microbes have a lot to say about questions such as,
p7
aV"Are we alone?"
p8
aVand they can tell us more about not only life in our solar system
p9
aVbut also maybe beyond,
p10
aVand this is why I am tracking them down in the most impossible places on Earth,
p11
aVin extreme environments where conditions
p12
aVare really pushing them to the brink of survival.
p13
aVActually, sometimes me too, when I'm trying to follow them too close.
p14
aVBut here's the thing:
p15
aVWe are the only advanced civilization in the solar system,
p16
aVbut that doesn't mean that there is no microbial life nearby.
p17
aVIn fact, the planets and moons you see here
p18
aVcould host life \u2014 all of them \u2014 and we know that,
p19
aVand it's a strong possibility.
p20
aVAnd if we were going to find life on those moons and planets,
p21
aVthen we would answer questions such as,
p22
aVare we alone in the solar system?
p23
aVWhere are we coming from?
p24
aVDo we have family in the neighborhood?
p25
aVIs there life beyond our solar system?
p26
aa(lp27
VAnd we can ask all those questions because there has been a revolution
p28
aVin our understanding of what a habitable planet is,
p29
aVand today, a habitable planet is a planet
p30
aVthat has a zone where water can stay stable,
p31
aVbut to me this is a horizontal definition of habitability,
p32
aVbecause it involves a distance to a star,
p33
aVbut there is another dimension to habitability,
p34
aVand this is a vertical dimension.
p35
aVThink of it as
p36
aVconditions in the subsurface of a planet where you are very far away from a sun,
p37
aVbut you still have water, energy, nutrients,
p38
aVwhich for some of them means food,
p39
aVand a protection.
p40
aVAnd when you look at the Earth,
p41
aVvery far away from any sunlight, deep in the ocean,
p42
aVyou have life thriving
p43
aVand it uses only chemistry for life processes.
p44
aa(lp45
VSo when you think of it  at that point, all walls collapse.
p46
aVYou have no limitations, basically.
p47
aVAnd if you have been looking at the headlines lately,
p48
aVthen you will see that we have discovered a subsurface ocean
p49
aVon Europa, on Ganymede, on Enceladus, on Titan,
p50
aVand now we are finding a geyser and hot springs on Enceladus,
p51
aVOur solar system is turning into a giant spa.
p52
aVFor anybody who has gone to a spa knows how much microbes like that, right?
p53
aV(Laughter)
p54
aa(lp55
VSo at that point, think also about Mars.
p56
aVThere is no life possible at the surface of Mars today,
p57
aVbut it might still be hiding underground.
p58
aa(lp59
VSo, we have been making progress in our understanding of habitability,
p60
aVbut we also have been making progress in our understanding
p61
aVof what the signatures of life are on Earth.
p62
aVAnd you can have what we call organic molecules,
p63
aVand these are the bricks of life,
p64
aVand you can have fossils,
p65
aVand you can minerals, biominerals,
p66
aVwhich is due to the reaction between bacteria and rocks,
p67
aVand of course you can have gases in the atmosphere.
p68
aVAnd when you look at those tiny green algae
p69
aVon the right of the slide here,
p70
aVthey are the direct descendants of those who have been pumping oxygen
p71
aVa billion years ago in the atmosphere of the Earth.
p72
aVWhen they did that, they poisoned 90 percent of the life
p73
aVat the surface of the Earth,
p74
aVbut they are the reason why you are breathing this air today.
p75
aa(lp76
VBut as much as our understanding grows of all of these things,
p77
aVthere is one question we still cannot answer,
p78
aVand this is, where are we coming from?
p79
aVAnd you know, it's getting worse,
p80
aVbecause we won't be able to find the physical evidence
p81
aVof where we are coming from on this planet,
p82
aVand the reason being is that anything that is older than four billion years is gone.
p83
aVAll record is gone,
p84
aVerased by plate tectonics and erosion.
p85
aVThis is what I call the Earth's biological horizon.
p86
aVBeyond this horizon we don't know where we are coming from.
p87
aa(lp88
VSo is everything lost? Well, maybe not.
p89
aVAnd we might be able to find evidence of our own origin
p90
aVin the most unlikely place, and this place in Mars.
p91
aa(lp92
VHow is this possible?
p93
aVWell clearly at the beginning of the solar system,
p94
aVMars and the Earth were bombarded by giant asteroids and comets,
p95
aVand there were ejecta from these impacts all over the place.
p96
aVEarth and Mars kept throwing rocks at each other for a very long time.
p97
aVPieces of rocks landed on the Earth.
p98
aVPieces of the Earth landed on Mars.
p99
aVSo clearly, those two planets may have been seeded by the same material.
p100
aVSo yeah, maybe Granddady is sitting there on the surface and waiting for us.
p101
aVBut that also means that we can go to Mars and try to find traces of our own origin.
p102
aVMars may hold that secret for us.
p103
aVThis is why Mars is so special to us.
p104
aa(lp105
VBut for that to happen,
p106
aVMars needed to be habitable at the time when conditions were right.
p107
aVSo was Mars habitable?
p108
aVWe have a number of missions telling us exactly the same thing today.
p109
aVAt the time when life appeared on the Earth,
p110
aVMars did have an ocean, it had volcanoes, it had lakes,
p111
aVand it had deltas like the beautiful picture you see here.
p112
aVThis picture was sent by the Curiosity  rover only a few weeks ago.
p113
aVIt shows the remnants of a delta, and this picture tells us something:
p114
aVwater was abundant
p115
aVand stayed founting at the surface for a very long time.
p116
aVThis is good news for life.
p117
aVLife chemistry takes a long time to actually happen.
p118
aa(lp119
VSo this is extremely good news,
p120
aVbut does that mean that if we go there, life will be easy to find on Mars?
p121
aVNot necessarily.
p122
aa(lp123
VHere's what happened:
p124
aVAt the time when life exploded at the surface of the Earth,
p125
aVthen everything went south for Mars,
p126
aVliterally.
p127
aVThe atmosphere was stripped away by solar winds,
p128
aVMars lost its magnetosphere,
p129
aVand then cosmic rays and U.V. bombarded the surface
p130
aVand water escaped to space and went underground.
p131
aVSo if we want to be able to understand,
p132
aVif we want to be able to find those traces of the signatures of life
p133
aVat the surface of Mars, if they are there,
p134
aVwe need to understand what was the impact of each of these events
p135
aVon the preservation of its record.
p136
aVOnly then will we be able to know where those signatures are hiding,
p137
aVand only then will we be able to send our rover to the right places
p138
aVwhere we can sample those rocks that may be telling us something
p139
aVreally important about who we are,
p140
aVor, if not, maybe telling us that somewhere, independently,
p141
aVlife has appeared on another planet.
p142
aa(lp143
VSo to do that, it's easy.
p144
aVYou only need to go back 3.5 billion years ago
p145
aVin the past of a planet.
p146
aVWe just need a time machine.
p147
aa(lp148
VEasy, right?
p149
aVWell, actually, it is.
p150
aVLook around you \u2014 that's planet Earth.
p151
aVThis is our time machine.
p152
aVGeologists are using it to go back in the past of our own planet.
p153
aVI am using it a little bit differently.
p154
aVI use planet Earth to go in very extreme environments
p155
aVwhere conditions were similar to those of Mars
p156
aVat the time when the climate changed,
p157
aVand there I'm trying  to understand what happened.
p158
aVWhat are the signatures of life?
p159
aVWhat is left? How are we going to find it?
p160
aVSo for one moment now I'm going to take you with me
p161
aVon a trip into that time machine.
p162
aa(lp163
VAnd now, what you see here, we are at 4,500 meters in the Andes,
p164
aVbut in fact we are less than a billion years after the Earth and Mars formed.
p165
aVThe Earth and Mars will have looked pretty much exactly like that \u2014
p166
aVvolcanoes everywhere, evaporating lakes everywhere,
p167
aVminerals, hot springs,
p168
aVand then you see those mounds on the shore of those lakes?
p169
aVThose are built by the descendants of the first organisms
p170
aVthat gave us the first fossil on Earth.
p171
aa(lp172
VBut if we want to understand what's  going on, we need to go a little further.
p173
aVAnd the other thing about those sites
p174
aVis that exactly like on Mars three and a half billion years ago,
p175
aVthe climate is changing very fast, and water and ice are disappearing.
p176
aVBut we need to go back to that time when everything changed on Mars,
p177
aVand to do that, we need to go higher.
p178
aVWhy is that?
p179
aVBecause when you go higher,
p180
aVthe atmosphere is getting thinner, it's getting more unstable,
p181
aVthe temperature is getting cooler, and you have a lot more U.V. radiation.
p182
aVBasically,
p183
aVyou are getting to those conditions on Mars when everything changed.
p184
aa(lp185
VSo I was not promising anything about a leisurely trip on the time machine.
p186
aVYou are not going to be sitting in that time machine.
p187
aVYou have to haul 1,000 pounds of equipment to the summit
p188
aVof this 20,000-foot volcano in the Andes here.
p189
aVThat's about 6,000 meters.
p190
aVAnd you also have to sleep on 42-degree slopes
p191
aVand really hope that there won't be any earthquake that night.
p192
aVBut when we get to the summit, we actually find the lake we came for.
p193
aVAt this altitude, this lake is experiencing exactly the same conditions
p194
aVas those on Mars three and a half billion years ago.
p195
aVAnd now we have to change our voyage
p196
aVinto an inner voyage inside that lake,
p197
aVand to do that, we have to remove our mountain gear
p198
aVand actually don suits and go for it.
p199
aVBut at the time we enter that lake, at the very moment we enter that lake,
p200
aVwe are stepping back
p201
aVthree and a half billion years in the past of another planet,
p202
aVand then we are going to get the answer came for.
p203
aVLife is everywhere, absolutely everywhere.
p204
aVEverything you see in this picture is a living organism.
p205
aVMaybe not so the diver, but everything else.
p206
aVBut this picture is very deceiving.
p207
aVLife is abundant in those lakes,
p208
aVbut like in many places on Earth  right now and due to climate change,
p209
aVthere is a huge loss in biodiversity.
p210
aVIn the samples that we took back home,
p211
aV36 percent of the bacteria in those lakes were composed of three species,
p212
aVand those three species are the ones that have survived so far.
p213
aa(lp214
VHere's another lake, right next to the first one.
p215
aVThe red color you see here is not due to minerals.
p216
aVIt's actually due to the presence of a tiny algae.
p217
aVIn this region, the U.V. radiation is really nasty.
p218
aVAnywhere on Earth, 11 is considered to be extreme.
p219
aVDuring U.V. storms there, the U.V. Index reaches 43.
p220
aVSPF 30 is not going to do anything  to you over there,
p221
aVand the water is so transparent in those lakes
p222
aVthat the algae has nowhere to hide, really,
p223
aVand so they are developing their own sunscreen,
p224
aVand this is the red color you see.
p225
aVBut they can adapt only so far,
p226
aVand then when all the water is gone from the surface,
p227
aVmicrobes have only one solution left:
p228
aVThey go underground.
p229
aVAnd those microbes, the rocks you see in that slide here,
p230
aVwell, they are actually living inside rocks
p231
aVand they are using the protection of the translucence of the rocks
p232
aVto get the good part of the U.V.
p233
aVand discard the part that could actually damage their DNA.
p234
aVAnd this is why we are taking our rover
p235
aVto train them to search  for life on Mars in these areas,
p236
aVbecause if there was life on Mars three and a half billion years ago,
p237
aVit had to use the same strategy to actually protect itself.
p238
aVNow, it is pretty obvious
p239
aVthat going to extreme environments is helping us very much
p240
aVfor the exploration of Mars  and to prepare missions.
p241
aVSo far, it has helped us to understand the geology of Mars.
p242
aVIt has helped to understand the past climate of Mars and its evolution,
p243
aVbut also its habitability potential.
p244
aVOur most recent rover on Mars has discovered traces of organics.
p245
aVYeah, there are organics at the surface of Mars.
p246
aVAnd it also discovered traces of methane.
p247
aVAnd we don't know yet if the methane in question
p248
aVis really from geology or biology.
p249
aVRegardless, what we know is that because of the discovery,
p250
aVthe hypothesis that there is still life present on Mars today
p251
aVremains a viable one.
p252
aa(lp253
VSo by now, I think I have convinced you that Mars is very special to us,
p254
aVbut it would be a mistake to think that Mars is the only place
p255
aVin the solar system that is interesting to find potential microbial life.
p256
aVAnd the reason is because Mars and the Earth
p257
aVcould have a common root to their tree of life,
p258
aVbut when you go beyond Mars, it's not that easy.
p259
aVCelestial mechanics  is not making it so easy
p260
aVfor an exchange of material between planets,
p261
aVand so if we were to discover life on those planets,
p262
aVit would be different from us.
p263
aVIt would be a different type of life.
p264
aVBut in the end, it might be just us,
p265
aVit might be us and Mars,
p266
aVor it can be many trees of life in the solar system.
p267
aVI don't know the answer yet, but I can tell you something:
p268
aVNo matter what the result is, no matter what that magic number is,
p269
aVit is going to give us a standard
p270
aVby which we are going to be able  to measure the life potential,
p271
aVabundance and diversity beyond our own solar system.
p272
aVAnd this can be achieved by our generation.
p273
aVThis can be our legacy, but only if we dare to explore.
p274
aa(lp275
VNow, finally,
p276
aVif somebody tells you that looking  for alien microbes is not cool
p277
aVbecause you cannot have a philosophical conversation with them,
p278
aVlet me show you why and how you can tell them they're wrong.
p279
aVWell, organic material is going to tell you
p280
aVabout environment, about complexity and about diversity.
p281
aVDNA, or any information carrier, is going to tell you about adaptation,
p282
aVabout evolution, about survival, about planetary changes
p283
aVand about the transfer of information.
p284
aVAll together, they are telling us
p285
aVwhat started as a microbial pathway,
p286
aVand why what started as a microbial pathway
p287
aVsometimes ends up as a civilization
p288
aVor sometimes ends up as a dead end.
p289
aa(lp290
VLook at the solar system, and look at the Earth.
p291
aVOn Earth, there are many intelligent species,
p292
aVbut only one has achieved technology.
p293
aVRight here in the journey of our own solar system,
p294
aVthere is a very, very powerful message
p295
aVthat says here's how we should look  for alien life, small and big.
p296
aVSo yeah, microbes are talking and we are listening,
p297
aVand they are taking us,
p298
aVone planet at a time and one moon at a time,
p299
aVtowards their big brothers out there.
p300
aVAnd they are telling us about diversity,
p301
aVthey are telling us about abundance of life,
p302
aVand they are telling us how this life has survived thus far
p303
aVto reach civilization,
p304
aVintelligence, technology and, indeed, philosophy.
