VRecently I visited Beloit, Wisconsin.
p4
aVAnd I was there to honor a great 20th century explorer,
p5
aVRoy Chapman Andrews.
p6
aVDuring his time at the American Museum of Natural History,
p7
aVAndrews led a range of expeditions to uncharted regions,
p8
aVlike here in the Gobi Desert.
p9
aVHe was quite a figure.
p10
aVHe was later, it's said, the basis of the Indiana Jones character.
p11
aa(lp12
VAnd when I was in Beloit, Wisconsin,
p13
aVI gave a public lecture to a group of middle school students.
p14
aVAnd I'm here to tell you,
p15
aVif there's anything more intimidating than talking here at TED,
p16
aVit'll be trying to hold the attention
p17
aVof a group of a thousand 12-year-olds for a 45-minute lecture.
p18
aVDon't try that one.
p19
aa(lp20
VAt the end of the lecture they asked a number of questions,
p21
aVbut there was one that's really stuck with me since then.
p22
aVThere was a young girl who stood up,
p23
aVand she asked the question:
p24
aV"Where should we explore?"
p25
aa(lp26
VI think there's a sense that many of us have
p27
aVthat the great age of exploration on Earth is over,
p28
aVthat for the next generation
p29
aVthey're going to have to go to outer space or the deepest oceans
p30
aVin order to find something significant to explore.
p31
aVBut is that really the case?
p32
aVIs there really nowhere significant for us to explore
p33
aVleft here on Earth?
p34
aa(lp35
VIt sort of made me think back
p36
aVto one of my favorite explorers in the history of biology.
p37
aVThis is an explorer of the unseen world, Martinus Beijerinck.
p38
aVSo Beijerinck set out to discover the cause
p39
aVof tobacco mosaic disease.
p40
aVWhat he did is he took the infected juice from tobacco plants
p41
aVand he would filter it through smaller and smaller filters.
p42
aVAnd he reached the point
p43
aVwhere he felt that there must be something out there
p44
aVthat was smaller than the smallest forms of life that were ever known \u2014
p45
aVbacteria, at the time.
p46
aVHe came up with a name for his mystery agent.
p47
aVHe called it the virus \u2014
p48
aVLatin for "poison."
p49
aVAnd in uncovering viruses,
p50
aVBeijerinck really opened this entirely new world for us.
p51
aa(lp52
VWe now know that viruses make up the majority
p53
aVof the genetic information on our planet,
p54
aVmore than the genetic information
p55
aVof all other forms of life combined.
p56
aVAnd obviously there's been tremendous practical applications
p57
aVassociated with this world \u2014
p58
aVthings like the eradication of smallpox,
p59
aVthe advent of a vaccine against cervical cancer,
p60
aVwhich we now know is mostly caused by human papillomavirus.
p61
aa(lp62
VAnd Beijerinck's discovery,
p63
aVthis was not something that occurred 500 years ago.
p64
aVIt was a little over 100 years ago
p65
aVthat Beijerinck discovered viruses.
p66
aVSo basically we had automobiles,
p67
aVbut we were unaware of the forms of life
p68
aVthat make up most of the genetic information on our planet.
p69
aa(lp70
VWe now have these amazing tools
p71
aVto allow us to explore the unseen world \u2014
p72
aVthings like deep sequencing,
p73
aVwhich allow us to do much more than just skim the surface
p74
aVand look at individual genomes from a particular species,
p75
aVbut to look at entire metagenomes,
p76
aVthe communities of teeming microorganisms in, on and around us
p77
aVand to document all of the genetic information in these species.
p78
aVWe can apply these techniques
p79
aVto things from soil to skin and everything in between.
p80
aa(lp81
VIn my organization we now do this on a regular basis
p82
aVto identify the causes of outbreaks
p83
aVthat are unclear exactly what causes them.
p84
aa(lp85
VAnd just to give you a sense of how this works,
p86
aVimagine that we took a nasal swab from every single one of you.
p87
aVAnd this is something we commonly do
p88
aVto look for respiratory viruses like influenza.
p89
aVThe first thing we would see
p90
aVis a tremendous amount of genetic information.
p91
aVAnd if we started looking into that genetic information,
p92
aVwe'd see a number of usual suspects out there \u2014
p93
aVof course, a lot of human genetic information,
p94
aVbut also bacterial and viral information,
p95
aVmostly from things that are completely harmless within your nose.
p96
aVBut we'd also see something very, very surprising.
p97
aVAs we started to look at this information,
p98
aVwe would see that about 20 percent of the genetic information in your nose
p99
aVdoesn't match anything that we've ever seen before \u2014
p100
aVno plant, animal, fungus, virus or bacteria.
p101
aVBasically we have no clue what this is.
p102
aa(lp103
VAnd for the small group of us who actually study this kind of data,
p104
aVa few of us have actually begun to call this information
p105
aVbiological dark matter.
p106
aVWe know it's not anything that we've seen before;
p107
aVit's sort of the equivalent of an uncharted continent
p108
aVright within our own genetic information.
p109
aVAnd there's a lot of it.
p110
aVIf you think 20 percent of genetic information in your nose is a lot
p111
aVof biological dark matter,
p112
aVif we looked at your gut,
p113
aVup to 40 or 50 percent of that information is biological dark matter.
p114
aVAnd even in the relatively sterile blood,
p115
aVaround one to two percent of this information is dark matter \u2014
p116
aVcan't be classified, can't be typed or matched with anything we've seen before.
p117
aa(lp118
VAt first we thought that perhaps this was artifact.
p119
aVThese deep sequencing tools are relatively new.
p120
aVBut as they become more and more accurate,
p121
aVwe've determined that this information is a form of life,
p122
aVor at least some of it is a form of life.
p123
aVAnd while the hypotheses for explaining the existence of biological dark matter
p124
aVare really only in their infancy,
p125
aVthere's a very, very exciting possibility that exists:
p126
aVthat buried in this life, in this genetic information,
p127
aVare signatures of as of yet unidentified life.
p128
aVThat as we explore these strings of A's, T's, C's and G's,
p129
aVwe may uncover a completely new class of life
p130
aVthat, like Beijerinck, will fundamentally change
p131
aVthe way that we think about the nature of biology.
p132
aVThat perhaps will allow us to identify the cause of a cancer that afflicts us
p133
aVor identify the source of an outbreak that we aren't familiar with
p134
aVor perhaps create a new tool in molecular biology.
p135
aa(lp136
VI'm pleased to announce that,
p137
aValong with colleagues at Stanford and Caltech and UCSF,
p138
aVwe're currently starting an initiative
p139
aVto explore biological dark matter for the existence of new forms of life.
p140
aa(lp141
VA little over a hundred years ago,
p142
aVpeople were unaware of viruses,
p143
aVthe forms of life that make up most of the genetic information on our planet.
p144
aVA hundred years from now, people may marvel
p145
aVthat we were perhaps completely unaware of a new class of life
p146
aVthat literally was right under our noses.
p147
aa(lp148
VIt's true, we may have charted all the continents on the planet
p149
aVand we may have discovered all the mammals that are out there,
p150
aVbut that doesn't mean that there's nothing left to explore on Earth.
p151
aVBeijerinck and his kind
p152
aVprovide an important lesson for the next generation of explorers \u2014
p153
aVpeople like that young girl from Beloit, Wisconsin.
p154
aVAnd I think if we phrase that lesson, it's something like this:
p155
aVDon't assume that what we currently think is out there is the full story.
p156
aVGo after the dark matter in whatever field you choose to explore.
p157
aVThere are unknowns all around us
p158
aVand they're just waiting to be discovered.
p159
