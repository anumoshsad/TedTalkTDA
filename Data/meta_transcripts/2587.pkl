VWhy bother?
p4
aVThe game is rigged.
p5
aVMy vote won't count.
p6
aVThe choices are terrible.
p7
aVVoting is for suckers.
p8
aa(lp9
VPerhaps you've thought some of these things.
p10
aVPerhaps you've even said them.
p11
aVAnd if so, you wouldn't be alone, and you wouldn't be entirely wrong.
p12
aVThe game of public policy today is rigged in many ways.
p13
aVHow else would more than half of federal tax breaks
p14
aVflow up to the wealthiest five percent of Americans?
p15
aVAnd our choices indeed are often terrible.
p16
aVFor many people across the political spectrum,
p17
aVExhibit A is the 2016 presidential election.
p18
aVBut in any year, you can look up and down the ballot
p19
aVand find plenty to be uninspired about.
p20
aa(lp21
VBut in spite of all this, I still believe voting matters.
p22
aVAnd crazy as it may sound,
p23
aVI believe we can revive the joy of voting.
p24
aVToday, I want to talk about how we can do that, and why.
p25
aa(lp26
VThere used to be a time in American history when voting was fun,
p27
aVwhen it was much more than just a grim duty to show up at the polls.
p28
aVThat time is called "most of American history."
p29
aa(lp30
V(Laughter)
p31
aa(lp32
VFrom the Revolution to the Civil Rights Era,
p33
aVthe United States had a vibrant,
p34
aVrobustly participatory and raucous culture of voting.
p35
aVIt was street theater, open-air debates, fasting and feasting and toasting,
p36
aVparades and bonfires.
p37
aVDuring the 19th century, immigrants and urban political machines
p38
aVhelped fuel this culture of voting.
p39
aVThat culture grew with each successive wave of new voters.
p40
aVDuring Reconstruction, when new African-American voters,
p41
aVnew African-American citizens,
p42
aVbegan to exercise their power,
p43
aVthey celebrated in jubilee parades
p44
aVthat connected emancipation with their newfound right to vote.
p45
aVA few decades later, the suffragettes
p46
aVbrought a spirit of theatricality to their fight,
p47
aVmarching together in white dresses as they claimed the franchise.
p48
aVAnd the Civil Rights Movement,
p49
aVwhich sought to redeem the promise of equal citizenship
p50
aVthat had been betrayed by Jim Crow,
p51
aVput voting right at the center.
p52
aVFrom Freedom Summer to the march in Selma,
p53
aVthat generation of activists knew that voting matters,
p54
aVand they knew that spectacle and the performance of power
p55
aVis key to actually claiming power.
p56
aa(lp57
VBut it's been over a half century since Selma and the Voting Rights Act,
p58
aVand in the decades since,
p59
aVthis face-to-face culture of voting
p60
aVhas just about disappeared.
p61
aVIt's been killed by television
p62
aVand then the internet.
p63
aVThe couch has replaced the commons.
p64
aVScreens have made citizens into spectators.
p65
aVAnd while it's nice to share political memes on social media,
p66
aVthat's a rather quiet kind of citizenship.
p67
aVIt's what the sociologist Sherry Turkle calls "being alone together."
p68
aa(lp69
VWhat we need today
p70
aVis an electoral culture that is about being together together,
p71
aVin person,
p72
aVin loud and passionate ways,
p73
aVso that instead of being "eat your vegetables" or "do you duty,"
p74
aVvoting can feel more like "join the club"
p75
aVor, better yet, "join the party."
p76
aa(lp77
VImagine if we had, across the country right now,
p78
aVin local places but nationwide,
p79
aVa concerted effort to revive a face-to-face set of ways
p80
aVto engage and electioneer:
p81
aVoutdoor shows in which candidates and their causes are mocked
p82
aVand praised in broad satirical style;
p83
aVsoapbox speeches by citizens;
p84
aVpublic debates held inside pubs;
p85
aVstreets filled with political art and handmade posters and murals;
p86
aVbattle of the band concerts in which competing performers rep their candidates.
p87
aVNow, all of this may sound a little bit 18th century to you,
p88
aVbut in fact, it doesn't have to be any more 18th century
p89
aVthan, say, Broadway's "Hamilton,"
p90
aVwhich is to say vibrantly contemporary.
p91
aa(lp92
VAnd the fact is that all around the world,
p93
aVtoday, millions of people are voting like this.
p94
aVIn India, elections are colorful, communal affairs.
p95
aVIn Brazil, election day is a festive, carnival-type atmosphere.
p96
aVIn Taiwan and Hong Kong, there is a spectacle,
p97
aVeye-popping, eye-grabbing spectacle
p98
aVto the street theater of elections.
p99
aa(lp100
VYou might ask, well, here in America, who has time for this?
p101
aVAnd I would tell you
p102
aVthat the average American watches five hours of television a day.
p103
aVYou might ask, who has the motivation?
p104
aVAnd I'll tell you,
p105
aVany citizen who wants to be seen and heard
p106
aVnot as a prop, not as a talking point,
p107
aVbut as a participant, as a creator.
p108
aa(lp109
VWell, how do we make this happen?
p110
aVSimply by making it happen.
p111
aa(lp112
VThat's why a group of colleagues and I
p113
aVlaunched a new project called "The Joy of Voting."
p114
aVIn four cities across the United States \u2014
p115
aVPhiladelphia, Miami,
p116
aVAkron, Ohio, and Wichita, Kansas \u2014
p117
aVwe've gathered together artists and activists,
p118
aVeducators, political folks, neighbors, everyday citizens
p119
aVto come together and create projects
p120
aVthat can foster this culture of voting in a local way.
p121
aa(lp122
VIn Miami, that means all-night parties with hot DJs
p123
aVwhere the only way to get in is to show that you're registered to vote.
p124
aVIn Akron, it means political plays
p125
aVbeing performed in the bed of a flatbed truck
p126
aVthat moves from neighborhood to neighborhood.
p127
aVIn Philadelphia,
p128
aVit's a voting-themed scavenger hunt all throughout colonial old town.
p129
aVAnd in Wichita, it's making mixtapes and live graffiti art
p130
aVin the North End to get out the vote.
p131
aVThere are 20 of these projects,
p132
aVand they are remarkable in their beauty and their diversity,
p133
aVand they are changing people.
p134
aVLet me tell you about a couple of them.
p135
aa(lp136
VIn Miami, we've commissioned and artist,
p137
aVa young artist named Atomico,
p138
aVto create some vivid and vibrant images for a new series of "I voted" stickers.
p139
aVBut the thing is, Atomico had never voted.
p140
aVHe wasn't even registered.
p141
aVSo as he got to work on creating this artwork for these stickers,
p142
aVhe also began to get over his sense of intimidation about politics.
p143
aVHe got himself registered,
p144
aVand then he got educated about the upcoming primary election,
p145
aVand on election day he was out there not just passing out stickers,
p146
aVbut chatting up voters and encouraging people to vote,
p147
aVand talking about the election with passersby.
p148
aa(lp149
VIn Akron, a theater company called the Wandering Aesthetics
p150
aVhas been putting on these pickup truck plays.
p151
aVAnd to do so, they put out an open call to the public
p152
aVasking for speeches, monologues, dialogues, poems,
p153
aVsnippets of anything that could be read aloud
p154
aVand woven into a performance.
p155
aVThey got dozens of submissions.
p156
aVOne of them was a poem
p157
aVwritten by nine students in an ESL class,
p158
aVall of them Hispanic migrant workers
p159
aVfrom nearby Hartville, Ohio.
p160
aVI want to read to you from this poem.
p161
aVIt's called "The Joy of Voting."
p162
aa(lp163
V"I would like to vote for the first time
p164
aVbecause things are changing for Hispanics.
p165
aVI used to be afraid of ghosts.
p166
aVNow I am afraid of people.
p167
aVThere's more violence and racism.
p168
aVVoting can change this.
p169
aVThe border wall is nothing.
p170
aVIt's just a wall.
p171
aVThe wall of shame is something.
p172
aVIt's very important to vote
p173
aVso we can break down this wall of shame.
p174
aVI have passion in my heart.
p175
aVVoting gives me a voice and power.
p176
aVI can stand up and do something."
p177
aa(lp178
V"The Joy of Voting" project isn't just about joy.
p179
aVIt's about this passion.
p180
aVIt's about feeling and belief,
p181
aVand it isn't just our organization's work.
p182
aVAll across this country right now,
p183
aVimmigrants, young people, veterans, people of all different backgrounds
p184
aVare coming together to create this kind of passionate, joyful activity
p185
aVaround elections,
p186
aVin red and blue states, in urban and rural communities,
p187
aVpeople of every political background.
p188
aVWhat they have in common is simply this:
p189
aVtheir work is rooted in place.
p190
aa(lp191
VBecause remember, all citizenship is local.
p192
aVWhen politics becomes just a presidential election,
p193
aVwe yell and we scream at our screens, and then we collapse, exhausted.
p194
aVBut when politics is about us
p195
aVand our neighbors and other people in our community
p196
aVcoming together to create experiences of collective voice and imagination,
p197
aVthen we begin to remember that this stuff matters.
p198
aVWe begin to remember that this is the stuff of self-government.
p199
aa(lp200
VWhich brings me back to where I began.
p201
aVWhy bother?
p202
aVThere's one way to answer this question.
p203
aVVoting matters because it is a self-fulfilling act of belief.
p204
aVIt feeds the spirit of mutual interest that makes any society thrive.
p205
aVWhen we vote, even if it is in anger,
p206
aVwe are part of a collective, creative leap of faith.
p207
aVVoting helps us generate the very power that we wish we had.
p208
aa(lp209
VIt's no accident that democracy and theater
p210
aVemerged around the same time in ancient Athens.
p211
aVBoth of them yank the individual out of the enclosure of her private self.
p212
aVBoth of them create great public experiences of shared ritual.
p213
aVBoth of them bring the imagination to life
p214
aVin ways that remind us that all of our bonds in the end
p215
aVare imagined, and can be reimagined.
p216
aa(lp217
VThis moment right now,
p218
aVwhen we think about the meaning of imagination,
p219
aVis so fundamentally important,
p220
aVand our ability to take that spirit
p221
aVand to take that sense
p222
aVthat there is something greater out there,
p223
aVis not just a matter of technical expertise.
p224
aVIt's not just a matter of making the time or having the know-how.
p225
aVIt is a matter of spirit.
p226
aa(lp227
VBut let me give you an answer to this question, "Why bother?"
p228
aVthat is maybe a little less spiritual and a bit more pointed.
p229
aVWhy bother voting?
p230
aVBecause there is no such thing as not voting.
p231
aVNot voting is voting,
p232
aVfor everything that you may detest and oppose.
p233
aVNot voting can be dressed up
p234
aVas an act of principled, passive resistance,
p235
aVbut in fact not voting
p236
aVis actively handing power over
p237
aVto those whose interests are counter to your own,
p238
aVand those who would be very glad to take advantage of your absence.
p239
aVNot voting is for suckers.
p240
aa(lp241
VImagine where this country would be
p242
aVif all the folks who in 2010 created the Tea Party
p243
aVhad decided that, you know, politics is too messy,
p244
aVvoting is too complicated.
p245
aVThere is no possibility of our votes adding up to anything.
p246
aVThey didn't preemptively silence themselves.
p247
aVThey showed up,
p248
aVand in the course of showing up, they changed American politics.
p249
aVImagine if all of the followers of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders
p250
aVhad decided not to upend the political status quo
p251
aVand blow apart the frame of the previously possible
p252
aVin American politics.
p253
aVThey did that by voting.
p254
aa(lp255
VWe live in a time right now,
p256
aVdivided, often very dark,
p257
aVwhere across the left and the right, there's a lot of talk of revolution
p258
aVand the need for revolution to disrupt everyday democracy.
p259
aVWell, here's the thing:
p260
aVeveryday democracy already gives us a playbook for revolution.
p261
aVIn the 2012 presidential election,
p262
aVyoung voters, Latino voters,
p263
aVAsian-American voters, low-income voters,
p264
aVall showed up at less than 50 percent.
p265
aVIn the 2014 midterm elections, turnout was 36 percent,
p266
aVwhich was a 70-year low.
p267
aVAnd in your average local election,
p268
aVturnout hovers somewhere around 20 percent.
p269
aa(lp270
VI invite you to imagine 100 percent.
p271
aVPicture 100 percent.
p272
aVMobilize 100 percent,
p273
aVand overnight, we get revolution.
p274
aVOvernight, the policy priorities of this country change dramatically,
p275
aVand every level of government becomes radically more responsive
p276
aVto all the people.
p277
aVWhat would it take to mobilize 100 percent?
p278
aVWell, we do have to push back against efforts afoot
p279
aVall across the country right now
p280
aVto make voting harder.
p281
aVBut at the same time,
p282
aVwe have to actively create a positive culture of voting
p283
aVthat people want to belong to,
p284
aVbe part of, and experience together.
p285
aVWe have to make purpose.
p286
aVWe have to make joy.
p287
aa(lp288
VSo yes, let's have that revolution,
p289
aVa revolution of spirit, of ideas,
p290
aVof policy and participation,
p291
aVa revolution against cynicism,
p292
aVa revolution against the self-fulfilling sense of powerlessness.
p293
aVLet's vote this revolution into existence,
p294
aVand while we're at it,
p295
aVlet's have some fun.
p296
aa(lp297
VThank you very much.
