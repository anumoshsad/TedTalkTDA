V"Why?"
p4
aV"Why?" is a question
p5
aVthat parents ask me all the time.
p6
aV"Why did my child develop autism?"
p7
aVAs a pediatrician, as a geneticist, as a researcher,
p8
aVwe try and address that question.
p9
aa(lp10
VBut autism is not a single condition.
p11
aVIt's actually a spectrum of disorders,
p12
aVa spectrum that ranges, for instance,
p13
aVfrom Justin, a 13-year-old boy
p14
aVwho's not verbal, who can't speak,
p15
aVwho communicates by using an iPad
p16
aVto touch pictures to communicate
p17
aVhis thoughts and his concerns,
p18
aVa little boy who, when he gets upset,
p19
aVwill start rocking,
p20
aVand eventually, when he's disturbed enough,
p21
aVwill bang his head to the point
p22
aVthat he can actually cut it open and require stitches.
p23
aVThat same diagnosis of autism, though,
p24
aValso applies to Gabriel,
p25
aVanother 13-year-old boy
p26
aVwho has quite a different set of challenges.
p27
aVHe's actually quite remarkably gifted in mathematics.
p28
aVHe can multiple three numbers by three numbers
p29
aVin his head with ease,
p30
aVyet when it comes to trying to have a conversation,
p31
aVhe has great difficulty.
p32
aVHe doesn't make eye contact.
p33
aVHe has difficulty starting a conversation,
p34
aVfeels awkward,
p35
aVand when he gets nervous,
p36
aVhe actually shuts down.
p37
aVYet both of these boys
p38
aVhave the same diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder.
p39
aa(lp40
VOne of the things that concerns us
p41
aVis whether or not there really is
p42
aVan epidemic of autism.
p43
aVThese days, one in 88 children
p44
aVwill be diagnosed with autism,
p45
aVand the question is,
p46
aVwhy does this graph look this way?
p47
aVHas that number been increasing
p48
aVdramatically over time?
p49
aVOr is it because we have now started labeling
p50
aVindividuals with autism,
p51
aVsimply giving them a diagnosis
p52
aVwhen they were still present there before
p53
aVyet simply didn't have that label?
p54
aVAnd in fact, in the late 1980s, the early 1990s,
p55
aVlegislation was passed
p56
aVthat actually provided individuals with autism
p57
aVwith resources, with access to educational materials
p58
aVthat would help them.
p59
aVWith that increased awareness, more parents,
p60
aVmore pediatricians, more educators
p61
aVlearned to recognize the features of autism.
p62
aVAs a result of that, more individuals were diagnosed
p63
aVand got access to the resources they needed.
p64
aVIn addition, we've changed our definition over time,
p65
aVso in fact we've widened the definition of autism,
p66
aVand that accounts for some of
p67
aVthe increased prevalence that we see.
p68
aa(lp69
VThe next question everyone wonders is,
p70
aVwhat caused autism?
p71
aVAnd a common misconception
p72
aVis that vaccines cause autism.
p73
aVBut let me be very clear:
p74
aVVaccines do not cause autism.
p75
aV(Applause)
p76
aVIn fact, the original research study
p77
aVthat suggested that was the case
p78
aVwas completely fraudulent.
p79
aVIt was actually retracted from the journal Lancet,
p80
aVin which it was published,
p81
aVand that author, a physician,
p82
aVhad his medical license taken away from him.
p83
aV(Applause)
p84
aVThe Institute of Medicine,
p85
aVThe Centers for Disease Control,
p86
aVhave repeatedly investigated this
p87
aVand there is no credible evidence
p88
aVthat vaccines cause autism.
p89
aVFurthermore,
p90
aVone of the ingredients in vaccines,
p91
aVsomething called thimerosal,
p92
aVwas thought to be what the cause of autism was.
p93
aVThat was actually removed from vaccines
p94
aVin the year 1992,
p95
aVand you can see that it really did not have an effect
p96
aVin what happened with the prevalence of autism.
p97
aVSo again, there is no evidence
p98
aVthat this is the answer.
p99
aVSo the question remains, what does cause autism?
p100
aa(lp101
VIn fact, there's probably not one single answer.
p102
aVJust as autism is a spectrum,
p103
aVthere's a spectrum of etiologies,
p104
aVa spectrum of causes.
p105
aVBased on epidemiological data,
p106
aVwe know that one of the causes,
p107
aVor one of the associations, I should say,
p108
aVis advanced paternal age,
p109
aVthat is, increasing age of the father
p110
aVat the time of conception.
p111
aVIn addition, another vulnerable
p112
aVand critical period in terms of development
p113
aVis when the mother is pregnant.
p114
aVDuring that period, while the fetal brain is developing,
p115
aVwe know that exposure to certain agents
p116
aVcan actually increase the risk of autism.
p117
aVIn particular, there's a medication, valproic acid,
p118
aVwhich mothers with epilepsy sometimes take,
p119
aVwe know can increase that risk of autism.
p120
aVIn addition, there can be some infectious agents
p121
aVthat can also cause autism.
p122
aa(lp123
VAnd one of the things I'm going to spend
p124
aVa lot of time focusing on
p125
aVare the genes that can cause autism.
p126
aVI'm focusing on this not because genes
p127
aVare the only cause of autism,
p128
aVbut it's a cause of autism
p129
aVthat we can readily define
p130
aVand be able to better understand the biology
p131
aVand understand better how the brain works
p132
aVso that we can come up with strategies
p133
aVto be able to intervene.
p134
aVOne of the genetic factors that we don't understand,
p135
aVhowever, is the difference that we see
p136
aVin terms of males and females.
p137
aVMales are affected four to one compared to females
p138
aVwith autism,
p139
aVand we really don't understand what that cause is.
p140
aa(lp141
VOne of the ways that we can understand
p142
aVthat genetics is a factor
p143
aVis by looking at something called
p144
aVthe concordance rate.
p145
aVIn other words, if one sibling has autism,
p146
aVwhat's the probability
p147
aVthat another sibling in that family will have autism?
p148
aVAnd we can look in particular
p149
aVat three types of siblings:
p150
aVidentical twins,
p151
aVtwins that actually share 100 percent
p152
aVof their genetic information
p153
aVand shared the same intrauterine environment,
p154
aVversus fraternal twins,
p155
aVtwins that actually share 50 percent
p156
aVof their genetic information,
p157
aVversus regular siblings,
p158
aVbrother-sister, sister-sister,
p159
aValso sharing 50 percent of their genetic information,
p160
aVyet not sharing the same intrauterine environment.
p161
aVAnd when you look at those concordance ratios,
p162
aVone of the striking things that you will see
p163
aVis that in identical twins,
p164
aVthat concordance rate is 77 percent.
p165
aVRemarkably, though,
p166
aVit's not 100 percent.
p167
aVIt is not that genes account for all of the risk for autism,
p168
aVbut yet they account for a lot of that risk,
p169
aVbecause when you look at fraternal twins,
p170
aVthat concordance rate is only 31 percent.
p171
aVOn the other hand, there is a difference
p172
aVbetween those fraternal twins and the siblings,
p173
aVsuggesting that there are common exposures
p174
aVfor those fraternal twins
p175
aVthat may not be shared as commonly
p176
aVwith siblings alone.
p177
aa(lp178
VSo this provides some of the data
p179
aVthat autism is genetic.
p180
aVWell, how genetic is it?
p181
aVWhen we compare it to other conditions
p182
aVthat we're familiar with,
p183
aVthings like cancer, heart disease, diabetes,
p184
aVin fact, genetics plays a much larger role in autism
p185
aVthan it does in any of these other conditions.
p186
aVBut with this, that doesn't tell us what the genes are.
p187
aVIt doesn't even tell us in any one child,
p188
aVis it one gene
p189
aVor potentially a combination of genes?
p190
aVAnd so in fact, in some individuals with autism,
p191
aVit is genetic!
p192
aVThat is, that it is one single,
p193
aVpowerful, deterministic gene
p194
aVthat causes the autism.
p195
aVHowever, in other individuals,
p196
aVit's genetic, that is,
p197
aVthat it's actually a combination of genes
p198
aVin part with the developmental process
p199
aVthat ultimately determines that risk for autism.
p200
aVWe don't know in any one person, necessarily,
p201
aVwhich of those two answers it is
p202
aVuntil we start digging deeper.
p203
aa(lp204
VSo the question becomes,
p205
aVhow can we start to identify
p206
aVwhat exactly those genes are.
p207
aVAnd let me pose something
p208
aVthat might not be intuitive.
p209
aVIn certain individuals,
p210
aVthey can have autism
p211
aVfor a reason that is genetic
p212
aVbut yet not because of autism running in the family.
p213
aVAnd the reason is because in certain individuals,
p214
aVthey can actually have genetic changes or mutations
p215
aVthat are not passed down from the mother
p216
aVor from the father,
p217
aVbut actually start brand new in them,
p218
aVmutations that are present
p219
aVin the egg or the sperm
p220
aVat the time of conception
p221
aVbut have not been passed down
p222
aVgeneration through generation within the family.
p223
aVAnd we can actually use that strategy
p224
aVto now understand and to identify
p225
aVthose genes causing autism in those individuals.
p226
aVSo in fact, at the Simons Foundation,
p227
aVwe took 2,600 individuals
p228
aVthat had no family history of autism,
p229
aVand we took that child and their mother and father
p230
aVand used them to try and understand
p231
aVwhat were those genes
p232
aVcausing autism in those cases?
p233
aVTo do that, we actually had to comprehensively
p234
aVbe able to look at all that genetic information
p235
aVand determine what those differences were
p236
aVbetween the mother, the father and the child.
p237
aVIn doing so, I apologize,
p238
aVI'm going to use an outdated analogy
p239
aVof encyclopedias rather than Wikipedia,
p240
aVbut I'm going to do so to try and help make the point
p241
aVthat as we did this inventory,
p242
aVwe needed to be able to look at
p243
aVmassive amounts of information.
p244
aVOur genetic information is organized
p245
aVinto a set of 46 volumes,
p246
aVand when we did that, we had to be able to account
p247
aVfor each of those 46 volumes,
p248
aVbecause in some cases with autism,
p249
aVthere's actually a single volume that's missing.
p250
aVWe had to get more granular than that, though,
p251
aVand so we had to start opening those books,
p252
aVand in some cases, the genetic change
p253
aVwas more subtle.
p254
aVIt might have been a single paragraph that was missing,
p255
aVor yet, even more subtle than that,
p256
aVa single letter,
p257
aVone out of three billion letters
p258
aVthat was changed, that was altered,
p259
aVyet had profound effects
p260
aVin terms of how the brain functions
p261
aVand affects behavior.
p262
aVIn doing this within these families,
p263
aVwe were able to account for approximately
p264
aV25 percent of the individuals
p265
aVand determine that there was a single
p266
aVpowerful genetic factor
p267
aVthat caused autism within those families.
p268
aVOn the other hand, there's 75 percent
p269
aVthat we still haven't figured out.
p270
aa(lp271
VAs we did this, though,
p272
aVit was really quite humbling,
p273
aVbecause we realized that there was not simply
p274
aVone gene for autism.
p275
aVIn fact, the current estimates are
p276
aVthat there are 200 to 400 different genes
p277
aVthat can cause autism.
p278
aVAnd that explains, in part,
p279
aVwhy we see such a broad spectrum
p280
aVin terms of its effects.
p281
aVAlthough there are that many genes,
p282
aVthere is some method to the madness.
p283
aVIt's not simply random
p284
aV200, 400 different genes,
p285
aVbut in fact they fit together.
p286
aVThey fit together in a pathway.
p287
aVThey fit together in a network
p288
aVthat's starting to make sense now
p289
aVin terms of how the brain functions.
p290
aVWe're starting to have a bottom-up approach
p291
aVwhere we're identifying those genes,
p292
aVthose proteins, those molecules,
p293
aVunderstanding how they interact together
p294
aVto make that neuron work,
p295
aVunderstanding how those neurons interact together
p296
aVto make circuits work,
p297
aVand understand how those circuits work
p298
aVto now control behavior,
p299
aVand understand that both in individuals with autism
p300
aVas well as individuals who have normal cognition.
p301
aVBut early diagnosis is a key for us.
p302
aVBeing able to make that diagnosis
p303
aVof someone who's susceptible
p304
aVat a time in a window
p305
aVwhere we have the ability to transform,
p306
aVto be able to impact
p307
aVthat growing, developing brain is critical.
p308
aVAnd so folks like Ami Klin have developed methods
p309
aVto be able to take infants, small babies,
p310
aVand be able to use biomarkers,
p311
aVin this case eye contact and eye tracking,
p312
aVto identify an infant at risk.
p313
aVThis particular infant, you can see,
p314
aVmaking very good eye contact with this woman
p315
aVas she's singing "Itsy, Bitsy Spider,"
p316
aVin fact is not going to develop autism.
p317
aVThis baby we know is going to be in the clear.
p318
aVOn the other hand, this other baby
p319
aVis going to go on to develop autism.
p320
aVIn this particular child, you can see,
p321
aVit's not making good eye contact.
p322
aVInstead of the eyes focusing in
p323
aVand having that social connection,
p324
aVlooking at the mouth, looking at the nose,
p325
aVlooking off in another direction,
p326
aVbut not again socially connecting,
p327
aVand being able to do this on a very large scale,
p328
aVscreen infants, screen children for autism,
p329
aVthrough something very robust, very reliable,
p330
aVis going to be very helpful to us in terms of being
p331
aVable to intervene at an early stage
p332
aVwhen we can have the greatest impact.
p333
aa(lp334
VHow are we going to intervene?
p335
aVIt's probably going to be a combination of factors.
p336
aVIn part, in some individuals,
p337
aVwe're going to try and use medications.
p338
aVAnd so in fact, identifying the genes for autism
p339
aVis important for us
p340
aVto identify drug targets,
p341
aVto identify things that we might be able to impact
p342
aVand can be certain that that's really
p343
aVwhat we need to do in autism.
p344
aVBut that's not going to be the only answer.
p345
aVBeyond just drugs, we're going to use educational strategies.
p346
aVIndividuals with autism,
p347
aVsome of them are wired a little bit differently.
p348
aVThey learn in a different way.
p349
aVThey absorb their surroundings in a different way,
p350
aVand we need to be able to educate them
p351
aVin a way that serves them best.
p352
aVBeyond that, there are a lot of individuals
p353
aVin this room who have great ideas
p354
aVin terms of new technologies we can use,
p355
aVeverything from devices we can use to train the brain
p356
aVto be able to make it more efficient
p357
aVand to compensate for areas in which
p358
aVit has a little bit of trouble,
p359
aVto even things like Google Glass.
p360
aVYou could imagine, for instance, Gabriel,
p361
aVwith his social awkwardness,
p362
aVmight be able to wear Google Glass
p363
aVwith an earpiece in his ear,
p364
aVand have a coach be able to help him,
p365
aVbe able to help think about conversations,
p366
aVconversation-starters,
p367
aVbeing able to even perhaps one day
p368
aVinvite a girl out on a date.
p369
aa(lp370
VAll of these new technologies
p371
aVjust offer tremendous opportunities
p372
aVfor us to be able to impact
p373
aVthe individuals with autism,
p374
aVbut yet we have a long way to go.
p375
aVAs much as we know,
p376
aVthere is so much more that we don't know,
p377
aVand so I invite all of you
p378
aVto be able to help us think about
p379
aVhow to do this better,
p380
aVto use as a community our collective wisdom
p381
aVto be able to make a difference,
p382
aVand in particular,
p383
aVfor the individuals in families with autism,
p384
aVI invite you to join the interactive autism network,
p385
aVto be part of the solution to this,
p386
aVbecause it's going to take really a lot of us
p387
aVto think about what's important,
p388
aVwhat's going to be a meaningful difference.
p389
aVAs we think about something
p390
aVthat's potentially a solution,
p391
aVhow well does it work?
p392
aVIs it something that's really going to make a difference
p393
aVin your lives, as an individual,
p394
aVas a family with autism?
p395
aVWe're going to need individuals of all ages,
p396
aVfrom the young to the old,
p397
aVand with all different shapes and sizes
p398
aVof the autism spectrum disorder
p399
aVto make sure that we can have an impact.
p400
aVSo I invite all of you to join the mission
p401
aVand to help to be able to make the lives
p402
aVof individuals with autism
p403
aVso much better and so much richer.
