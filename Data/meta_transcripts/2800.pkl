VThe best Christmas my children ever had
p4
aVwas also the worst Christmas my husband and I ever had.
p5
aVElizabeth, age seven,
p6
aVand her brother, Ian, age five,
p7
aVcouldn't imagine why they were getting everything they wanted for Christmas.
p8
aVThe reason Santa was so generous
p9
aVwas because of something my husband Pat and I knew
p10
aVand the kids couldn't comprehend.
p11
aVSomething that we had just learned, and it terrified us.
p12
aa(lp13
VThis was 1994
p14
aVand the story actually starts a few years earlier.
p15
aVFor a couple of years I had noticed a rash on the sides of Elizabeth's neck
p16
aVthat looked like prickly heat.
p17
aVFor those same years, my father and brother both died of cancer,
p18
aVand I was probably overanxious about illness.
p19
aVThe doctors assured us there was nothing wrong
p20
aVand I shouldn't worry,
p21
aVbut I wasn't so sure.
p22
aVAnd so without a referral, and paying out-of-pocket,
p23
aVI took Elizabeth to a dermatologist.
p24
aVShe was probably just allergic to something,
p25
aVbut why did it appear just on the sides of her neck, this rash?
p26
aa(lp27
VSo it's two days before Christmas,
p28
aV1994,
p29
aVand the dermatologist takes a quick look at her neck and says,
p30
aV"She has pseudoxanthoma elasticum."
p31
aVAnd then he shuts off the lights and looks in her eyes.
p32
aVIt turns out, by chance,
p33
aVthis dermatologist also trained in ophthalmology.
p34
aVOur lucky day.
p35
aVI am sick to my stomach.
p36
aV"Oma?"
p37
aVOma's like melanoma, lymphoma \u2014
p38
aVcancer.
p39
aV"Why are you looking in her eyes for a skin rash?"
p40
aVI scream and make no sound.
p41
aa(lp42
VSo there it is.
p43
aVElizabeth has pseudoxanthoma elasticum,
p44
aVPXE for short.
p45
aVQuestions mix with fear
p46
aVand erupt like bile in my throat.
p47
aVWhy are you looking in her eyes?
p48
aVWhat do you know about this? How do you know for sure?
p49
aVWhat is the prognosis?
p50
aVMy training in pastoral counseling did not prepare me for this.
p51
aa(lp52
VDr. Bercovitch tells us everything he knows about PXE.
p53
aVIt's a rare genetic disorder,
p54
aVit's systemic,
p55
aVit's a slowly progressing, premature aging disease.
p56
aVIt causes loose wrinkly skin in the flexor areas.
p57
aVIt causes legal blindness,
p58
aVlike macular degeneration,
p59
aVand a host of cardiovascular problems.
p60
aVLittle is known about this disease,
p61
aVand some people die in their 30s,
p62
aVsay some of the reports at the time.
p63
aVHe then just glances at our son and says,
p64
aV"He has it, too."
p65
aVWe want to flee back to the land of normal.
p66
aa(lp67
VTwo days after Christmas,
p68
aVresearchers come from a university in Boston,
p69
aVand they take blood from us and our children
p70
aVfor a research project focused on finding the gene.
p71
aVA few days later,
p72
aVresearchers come from a medical center in New York
p73
aVand say they want blood, too.
p74
aV"These are children.
p75
aVThey're five and seven years old.
p76
aVDon't make them face the needle twice.
p77
aVGo and get your share from the other researchers."
p78
aVThey laugh, incredulous.
p79
aV"Share?"
p80
aVIt is then that we learn that there is little sharing in biomedical research.
p81
aa(lp82
VThis moment, more than any other,
p83
aVlit a fire beneath my husband Pat and me.
p84
aVPat and I went to a medical school library
p85
aVand we copied every article we could find on PXE.
p86
aVWe didn't understand a thing.
p87
aVWe bought medical dictionaries and scientific textbooks
p88
aVand read everything we could get our hands on.
p89
aVAnd though we still didn't understand,
p90
aVwe could see patterns,
p91
aVand it became quickly apparent within a month
p92
aVthat there was no systematic effort to understand PXE.
p93
aa(lp94
VIn addition,
p95
aVthe lack of sharing that we experienced was pervasive.
p96
aVResearchers competed with each other
p97
aVbecause the ecosystem was designed to reward competition
p98
aVrather than to alleviate suffering.
p99
aVWe realized that we would have to do work on this condition ourselves
p100
aVto find solutions for ourselves and others like us.
p101
aVBut we faced two major barriers.
p102
aVThe first one:
p103
aVPat and I have no science background.
p104
aVAt the time, he's the manager of a construction company,
p105
aVand I'm a former college chaplain stay-at-home mom \u2014
p106
aVhardly the backgrounds to take the research world by storm.
p107
aVThe second barrier:
p108
aVresearchers don't share.
p109
aVPeople told us you can't herd cats.
p110
aVWell, yes you can if you move their food.
p111
aa(lp112
V(Laughter)
p113
aa(lp114
V(Applause)
p115
aa(lp116
VDNA and clinical data is the food.
p117
aVSo we would collect blood and medical histories,
p118
aVand require that all scientists using these resources
p119
aVwould share results with each other and with the people who donated.
p120
aa(lp121
VWell before the internet was in common use,
p122
aVPat and I established PXE International,
p123
aVa nonprofit dedicated to initiating research and conducting it on PXE
p124
aVand also supporting individuals with the disease.
p125
aVUsing traditional media,
p126
aVwe garnered around 100-150 people around the world
p127
aVwho we asked,
p128
aVwould you give us your blood, your tissue, your medical histories,
p129
aVyour medical records?
p130
aVAnd we brought all of that together.
p131
aa(lp132
VWe quickly learned that this shared resource was not going to be enough.
p133
aVAnd so we decided we had to do hardcore bench science \u2014
p134
aVhardcore research.
p135
aVSo we borrowed bench space at a lab at Harvard.
p136
aVA wonderful neighbor came a couple times a week
p137
aVand sat with the kids from 8pm to 2am
p138
aVwhile Pat and I extracted DNA,
p139
aVran and scored gels
p140
aVand searched for the gene.
p141
aVGenerous postdocs tutored us as we went along.
p142
aVWithin a few years, we found the gene.
p143
aVWe patented it so that it would be freely available.
p144
aVWe created a diagnostic test.
p145
aVWe put together a research consortium.
p146
aVWe held research meetings and opened a center of excellence.
p147
aVWe found more than 4,000 people around the world who had PXE,
p148
aVand held patient meetings
p149
aVand did clinical trials and studies.
p150
aa(lp151
VThrough all this,
p152
aVwe lived with fear.
p153
aVFear of the disease breathing down our neck
p154
aVwhile the clock ticked.
p155
aVFear of researchers,
p156
aVso well credentialed and positioned in a world made for them.
p157
aVFear that we were making the wrong choices.
p158
aVFear that the naysayers were right
p159
aVand the cats would simply find a new food.
p160
aVBut greater than all these fears was our drive to make a difference
p161
aVfor our kids and for all those we had met along the way.
p162
aVAnd very quickly,
p163
aVwe also realized what we were doing for one disease,
p164
aVwe should do for all diseases.
p165
aa(lp166
VWe joined with, and I eventually led,
p167
aVGenetic Alliance \u2014
p168
aVa network of health advocacy,
p169
aVpatient advocacy,
p170
aVresearch and health organizations.
p171
aVWe built scalable and extensible resources,
p172
aVlike biobanks and registries and directories of support
p173
aVfor all diseases.
p174
aVAnd as I learned about all those diseases and all those disease communities,
p175
aVI realized that there were two secrets in health care
p176
aVthat were impacting me greatly.
p177
aVThe first:
p178
aVthere are no ready answers for people like my kids
p179
aVor all the people I was working with,
p180
aVwhether common or rare conditions.
p181
aVAnd the second secret:
p182
aVthe answers lie in all of us together,
p183
aVdonating our data,
p184
aVour biological samples
p185
aVand ultimately ourselves.
p186
aa(lp187
VThere is a small groundswell of individuals
p188
aVwho are working to change this.
p189
aVCitizen scientists, activists, hacks
p190
aVwho are using crowdsourcing, do-it-yourself science
p191
aVare changing the game.
p192
aVEven President Obama and Vice President Biden
p193
aVare evangelists for the idea
p194
aVthat people should be partners in research.
p195
aVThis is a founding principle of our organization.
p196
aVSure, it's really hard
p197
aVto discover and develop interventions and therapies.
p198
aVThe science is hard,
p199
aVthe regulatory regime is difficult.
p200
aVThere are a lot of stakeholders with lots of interests
p201
aVand misaligned incentives like publishing, promotion and tenure.
p202
aVI don't fault scientists for following this path,
p203
aVbut I challenge them and us to do this differently.
p204
aVTo recognize that people are at the center.
p205
aa(lp206
VGenetic Alliance has experimented
p207
aVin what it will take to transform these crusty systems.
p208
aVOur goal is to work without boundaries.
p209
aVThat sounds abstract, but for us it's quite practical.
p210
aVWhen we're frustrated that entities won't share data \u2014
p211
aVdata that comes from people who gave their energy, their time, their blood
p212
aVand even their tears \u2014
p213
aVwe need to stop and ask,
p214
aV"How is it true that we could share, but we aren't?"
p215
aVWe're part of this system, too.
p216
aVHow do we make it so that people can share ideas freely?
p217
aVSo that people can take risks and move closer to one another?
p218
aa(lp219
VThis leads to a dissolving of us versus them,
p220
aVnot only for organizations but also for individuals.
p221
aVIf I'm going to ask organizations or individuals
p222
aVto strive for these standards,
p223
aVthen I too need to explore my own being and my practices.
p224
aVIf I'm going to ask clinicians and researchers and administrators
p225
aVto take risks,
p226
aVthen I, Sharon, need to take risks as well.
p227
aVI need to face my personal fears.
p228
aVMy fear of not having enough impact.
p229
aVMy fear of not leading well.
p230
aVMy fear of not being enough.
p231
aa(lp232
VJust before they entered their teens, our kids stopped us in our tracks
p233
aVand said, "You have to stop worrying about making a difference,
p234
aVmaking an impact,
p235
aVand instead, like us, learn to live with disease
p236
aVrather than fight it."
p237
aVI have to ask,
p238
aVwhere does all my fear come from?
p239
aVThe kids' declaration shines a spotlight on that fear.
p240
aVIt arises from a bedrock of love.
p241
aVI love Elizabeth and Ian.
p242
aVI love people with PXE.
p243
aVI love people with any disease.
p244
aVI love people.
p245
aVSome of my colleagues have discovered that it is not death we fear,
p246
aVit is the enormity of our loving.
p247
aVThis expansive love opens me to great pain
p248
aVas I face loss.
p249
aa(lp250
VAs I discover my fear,
p251
aVI discover that I
p252
aVand all those around me
p253
aVhave boundless capacity for love.
p254
aVAnd I also discover
p255
aVas I move into this fear,
p256
aVthat I can learn many new things
p257
aVand find paths
p258
aVto things like practical solutions
p259
aVas well as the core of healing and health.
p260
aa(lp261
VI don't fear fear the way I used to.
p262
aVIn fact lately, with enormous support from all my fellow journeyers,
p263
aVI notice that it's not a warning the way it used to be.
p264
aVI notice that instead,
p265
aVit's an invitation to go forward
p266
aVbecause in it lies love and the path to greater love.
p267
aVIf I turn with gentle curiosity toward that fear,
p268
aVI find enormous wealth within myself and others
p269
aVand the ability to step into challenges that I never thought I could.
p270
aa(lp271
VMy kids are ahead of me on that path still.
p272
aVAt ages 29 and 27,
p273
aVthey declare they are happy and healthy
p274
aVdespite having manifestations of PXE in their skin and eyes and arteries.
p275
aVAnd so I invite you, us, we,
p276
aVto turn toward our fear;
p277
aVto embrace the things that scare us
p278
aVand find the love at the center.
p279
aVWe'll not only find ourselves there
p280
aVbut we'll also be able to step into the shoes of those we fear
p281
aVand those who fear us.
p282
aVIf we breathe into that fear
p283
aVand are vulnerable with the systems and people who challenge us,
p284
aVour power as changemakers grows exponentially.
p285
aVAnd when we realize
p286
aVthat working on our inner life is working on our outer life
p287
aVand outer work is inner work,
p288
aVwe get down to what is real
p289
aVand shit gets done.
p290
aa(lp291
V(Laughter)
p292
aa(lp293
VThere is no limit to what we can accomplish together.
p294
aa(lp295
VThank you.
