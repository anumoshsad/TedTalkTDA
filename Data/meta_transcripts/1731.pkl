p6
aa(lp7
VAll right, all right.
p8
aVSo more than just explosions,
p9
aVchemistry is everywhere.
p10
aVHave you ever found yourself at a restaurant spacing out
p11
aVjust doing this over and over?
p12
aVSome people nodding yes.
p13
aVRecently, I showed this to my students,
p14
aVand I just asked them to try and explain why it happened.
p15
aVThe questions and conversations that followed
p16
aVwere fascinating.
p17
aVCheck out this video that Maddie
p18
aVfrom my period three class sent me that evening.
p19
aa(lp20
V(Clang) (Laughs)
p21
aa(lp22
VNow obviously, as Maddie's chemistry teacher,
p23
aVI love that she went home and continued to geek out
p24
aVabout this kind of ridiculous demonstration
p25
aVthat we did in class.
p26
aVBut what fascinated me more is that Maddie's curiosity
p27
aVtook her to a new level.
p28
aVIf you look inside that beaker,
p29
aVyou might see a candle.
p30
aVMaddie's using temperature to extend this phenomenon
p31
aVto a new scenario.
p32
aa(lp33
VYou know, questions and curiosity like Maddie's
p34
aVare magnets that draw us towards our teachers,
p35
aVand they transcend all technology
p36
aVor buzzwords in education.
p37
aVBut if we place these technologies before student inquiry,
p38
aVwe can be robbing ourselves
p39
aVof our greatest tool as teachers: our students' questions.
p40
aVFor example, flipping a boring lecture from the classroom
p41
aVto the screen of a mobile device
p42
aVmight save instructional time,
p43
aVbut if it is the focus of our students' experience,
p44
aVit's the same dehumanizing chatter
p45
aVjust wrapped up in fancy clothing.
p46
aVBut if instead we have the guts
p47
aVto confuse our students, perplex them,
p48
aVand evoke real questions,
p49
aVthrough those questions, we as teachers have information
p50
aVthat we can use to tailor robust
p51
aVand informed methods of blended instruction.
p52
aa(lp53
VSo, 21st-century lingo jargon mumbo jumbo aside,
p54
aVthe truth is, I've been teaching for 13 years now,
p55
aVand it took a life-threatening situation
p56
aVto snap me out of 10 years of pseudo-teaching
p57
aVand help me realize that student questions
p58
aVare the seeds of real learning,
p59
aVnot some scripted curriculum
p60
aVthat gave them tidbits of random information.
p61
aa(lp62
VIn May of 2010, at 35 years old,
p63
aVwith a two-year-old at home and my second child on the way,
p64
aVI was diagnosed with a large aneurysm
p65
aVat the base of my thoracic aorta.
p66
aVThis led to open-heart surgery. This is the actual real email
p67
aVfrom my doctor right there.
p68
aVNow, when I got this, I was \u2014 press Caps Lock \u2014
p69
aVabsolutely freaked out, okay?
p70
aVBut I found surprising moments of comfort
p71
aVin the confidence that my surgeon embodied.
p72
aVWhere did this guy get this confidence, the audacity of it?
p73
aa(lp74
VSo when I asked him, he told me three things.
p75
aVHe said first, his curiosity drove him
p76
aVto ask hard questions about the procedure,
p77
aVabout what worked and what didn't work.
p78
aVSecond, he embraced, and didn't fear,
p79
aVthe messy process of trial and error,
p80
aVthe inevitable process of trial and error.
p81
aVAnd third, through intense reflection,
p82
aVhe gathered the information that he needed
p83
aVto design and revise the procedure,
p84
aVand then, with a steady hand, he saved my life.
p85
aa(lp86
VNow I absorbed a lot from these words of wisdom,
p87
aVand before I went back into the classroom that fall,
p88
aVI wrote down three rules of my own
p89
aVthat I bring to my lesson planning still today.
p90
aVRule number one: Curiosity comes first.
p91
aVQuestions can be windows to great instruction,
p92
aVbut not the other way around.
p93
aVRule number two: Embrace the mess.
p94
aVWe're all teachers. We know learning is ugly.
p95
aVAnd just because the scientific method is allocated
p96
aVto page five of section 1.2 of chapter one
p97
aVof the one that we all skip, okay,
p98
aVtrial and error can still be an informal part
p99
aVof what we do every single day
p100
aVat Sacred Heart Cathedral in room 206.
p101
aVAnd rule number three: Practice reflection.
p102
aVWhat we do is important. It deserves our care,
p103
aVbut it also deserves our revision.
p104
aVCan we be the surgeons of our classrooms?
p105
aVAs if what we are doing one day will save lives.
p106
aVOur students our worth it.
p107
aVAnd each case is different.
p108
aa(lp109
V(Explosion)
p110
aa(lp111
VAll right. Sorry.
p112
aVThe chemistry teacher in me just needed to get that
p113
aVout of my system before we move on.
p114
aa(lp115
VSo these are my daughters.
p116
aVOn the right we have little Emmalou \u2014 Southern family.
p117
aVAnd, on the left, Riley.
p118
aVNow Riley's going to be a big girl in a couple weeks here.
p119
aVShe's going to be four years old,
p120
aVand anyone who knows a four-year-old
p121
aVknows that they love to ask, "Why?"
p122
aVYeah. Why.
p123
aVI could teach this kid anything
p124
aVbecause she is curious about everything.
p125
aVWe all were at that age.
p126
aVBut the challenge is really for Riley's future teachers,
p127
aVthe ones she has yet to meet.
p128
aVHow will they grow this curiosity?
p129
aa(lp130
VYou see, I would argue that Riley is a metaphor for all kids,
p131
aVand I think dropping out of school comes in many different forms \u2014
p132
aVto the senior who's checked out before the year's even begun
p133
aVor that empty desk in the back of an urban middle school's classroom.
p134
aVBut if we as educators leave behind
p135
aVthis simple role as disseminators of content
p136
aVand embrace a new paradigm
p137
aVas cultivators of curiosity and inquiry,
p138
aVwe just might bring a little bit more meaning
p139
aVto their school day, and spark their imagination.
p140
aa(lp141
