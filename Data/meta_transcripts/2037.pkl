VWhen we think about prejudice and bias,
p4
aVwe tend to think about stupid and evil people
p5
aVdoing stupid and evil things.
p6
aVAnd this idea is nicely summarized
p7
aVby the British critic William Hazlitt,
p8
aVwho wrote, "Prejudice is the child of ignorance."
p9
aVI want to try to convince you here
p10
aVthat this is mistaken.
p11
aVI want to try to convince you
p12
aVthat prejudice and bias
p13
aVare natural, they're often rational,
p14
aVand they're often even moral,
p15
aVand I think that once we understand this,
p16
aVwe're in a better position to make sense of them
p17
aVwhen they go wrong,
p18
aVwhen they have horrible consequences,
p19
aVand we're in a better position to know what to do
p20
aVwhen this happens.
p21
aa(lp22
VSo, start with stereotypes. You look at me,
p23
aVyou know my name, you know certain facts about me,
p24
aVand you could make certain judgments.
p25
aVYou could make guesses about my ethnicity,
p26
aVmy political affiliation, my religious beliefs.
p27
aVAnd the thing is, these judgments tend to be accurate.
p28
aVWe're very good at this sort of thing.
p29
aVAnd we're very good at this sort of thing
p30
aVbecause our ability to stereotype people
p31
aVis not some sort of arbitrary quirk of the mind,
p32
aVbut rather it's a specific instance
p33
aVof a more general process,
p34
aVwhich is that we have experience
p35
aVwith things and people in the world
p36
aVthat fall into categories,
p37
aVand we can use our experience to make generalizations
p38
aVabout novel instances of these categories.
p39
aVSo everybody here has a lot of experience
p40
aVwith chairs and apples and dogs,
p41
aVand based on this, you could see
p42
aVunfamiliar examples and you could guess,
p43
aVyou could sit on the chair,
p44
aVyou could eat the apple, the dog will bark.
p45
aVNow we might be wrong.
p46
aVThe chair could collapse if you sit on it,
p47
aVthe apple might be poison, the dog might not bark,
p48
aVand in fact, this is my dog Tessie, who doesn't bark.
p49
aVBut for the most part, we're good at this.
p50
aVFor the most part, we make good guesses
p51
aVboth in the social domain and the non-social domain,
p52
aVand if we weren't able to do so,
p53
aVif we weren't able to make guesses about new instances that we encounter,
p54
aVwe wouldn't survive.
p55
aVAnd in fact, Hazlitt later on in his wonderful essay
p56
aVconcedes this.
p57
aVHe writes, "Without the aid of prejudice and custom,
p58
aVI should not be able to find my way my across the room;
p59
aVnor know how to conduct myself in any circumstances,
p60
aVnor what to feel in any relation of life."
p61
aVOr take bias.
p62
aVNow sometimes, we break the world up into
p63
aVus versus them, into in-group versus out-group,
p64
aVand sometimes when we do this,
p65
aVwe know we're doing something wrong,
p66
aVand we're kind of ashamed of it.
p67
aVBut other times we're proud of it.
p68
aVWe openly acknowledge it.
p69
aVAnd my favorite example of this
p70
aVis a question that came from the audience
p71
aVin a Republican debate prior to the last election.
p72
aa(lp73
V(Video) Anderson Cooper: Gets to your question,
p74
aVthe question in the hall, on foreign aid? Yes, ma'am.
p75
aa(lp76
VWoman: The American people are suffering
p77
aVin our country right now.
p78
aVWhy do we continue to send foreign aid
p79
aVto other countries
p80
aVwhen we need all the help we can get for ourselves?
p81
aa(lp82
VAC: Governor Perry, what about that?
p83
aa(lp84
V(Applause)
p85
aVRick Perry: Absolutely, I think it's\u2014
p86
aa(lp87
VPaul Bloom: Each of the people onstage
p88
aVagreed with the premise of her question,
p89
aVwhich is as Americans, we should care more
p90
aVabout Americans than about other people.
p91
aVAnd in fact, in general, people are often swayed
p92
aVby feelings of solidarity, loyalty, pride, patriotism,
p93
aVtowards their country or towards their ethnic group.
p94
aVRegardless of your politics, many people feel proud to be American,
p95
aVand they favor Americans over other countries.
p96
aVResidents of other countries feel the same about their nation,
p97
aVand we feel the same about our ethnicities.
p98
aa(lp99
VNow some of you may reject this.
p100
aVSome of you may be so cosmopolitan
p101
aVthat you think that ethnicity and nationality
p102
aVshould hold no moral sway.
p103
aVBut even you sophisticates accept
p104
aVthat there should be some pull
p105
aVtowards the in-group in the domain of friends and family,
p106
aVof people you're close to,
p107
aVand so even you make a distinction
p108
aVbetween us versus them.
p109
aa(lp110
VNow, this distinction is natural enough
p111
aVand often moral enough, but it can go awry,
p112
aVand this was part of the research
p113
aVof the great social psychologist Henri Tajfel.
p114
aVTajfel was born in Poland in 1919.
p115
aVHe left to go to university in France,
p116
aVbecause as a Jew, he couldn't go to university in Poland,
p117
aVand then he enlisted in the French military
p118
aVin World War II.
p119
aVHe was captured and ended up
p120
aVin a prisoner of war camp,
p121
aVand it was a terrifying time for him,
p122
aVbecause if it was discovered that he was a Jew,
p123
aVhe could have been moved to a concentration camp,
p124
aVwhere he most likely would not have survived.
p125
aVAnd in fact, when the war ended and he was released,
p126
aVmost of his friends and family were dead.
p127
aVHe got involved in different pursuits.
p128
aVHe helped out the war orphans.
p129
aVBut he had a long-lasting interest
p130
aVin the science of prejudice,
p131
aVand so when a prestigious British scholarship
p132
aVon stereotypes opened up, he applied for it,
p133
aVand he won it,
p134
aVand then he began this amazing career.
p135
aVAnd what started his career is an insight
p136
aVthat the way most people were thinking
p137
aVabout the Holocaust was wrong.
p138
aVMany people, most people at the time,
p139
aVviewed the Holocaust as sort of representing
p140
aVsome tragic flaw on the part of the Germans,
p141
aVsome genetic taint, some authoritarian personality.
p142
aVAnd Tajfel rejected this.
p143
aVTajfel said what we see in the Holocaust
p144
aVis just an exaggeration
p145
aVof normal psychological processes
p146
aVthat exist in every one of us.
p147
aVAnd to explore this, he did a series of classic studies
p148
aVwith British adolescents.
p149
aVAnd in one of his studies, what he did was he asked
p150
aVthe British adolescents all sorts of questions,
p151
aVand then based on their answers, he said,
p152
aV"I've looked at your answers, and based on the answers,
p153
aVI have determined that you are either" \u2014
p154
aVhe told half of them \u2014
p155
aV"a Kandinsky lover, you love the work of Kandinsky,
p156
aVor a Klee lover, you love the work of Klee."
p157
aVIt was entirely bogus.
p158
aVTheir answers had nothing to do with Kandinsky or Klee.
p159
aVThey probably hadn't heard of the artists.
p160
aVHe just arbitrarily divided them up.
p161
aVBut what he found was, these categories mattered,
p162
aVso when he later gave the subjects money,
p163
aVthey would prefer to give the money
p164
aVto members of their own group
p165
aVthan members of the other group.
p166
aVWorse, they were actually most interested
p167
aVin establishing a difference
p168
aVbetween their group and other groups,
p169
aVso they would give up money for their own group
p170
aVif by doing so they could give the other group even less.
p171
aa(lp172
VThis bias seems to show up very early.
p173
aVSo my colleague and wife, Karen Wynn, at Yale
p174
aVhas done a series of studies with babies
p175
aVwhere she exposes babies to puppets,
p176
aVand the puppets have certain food preferences.
p177
aVSo one of the puppets might like green beans.
p178
aVThe other puppet might like graham crackers.
p179
aVThey test the babies own food preferences,
p180
aVand babies typically prefer the graham crackers.
p181
aVBut the question is, does this matter to babies
p182
aVin how they treat the puppets? And it matters a lot.
p183
aVThey tend to prefer the puppet
p184
aVwho has the same food tastes that they have,
p185
aVand worse, they actually prefer puppets
p186
aVwho punish the puppet with the different food taste.
p187
aV(Laughter)
p188
aa(lp189
VWe see this sort of in-group, out-group psychology all the time.
p190
aVWe see it in political clashes
p191
aVwithin groups with different ideologies.
p192
aVWe see it in its extreme in cases of war,
p193
aVwhere the out-group isn't merely given less,
p194
aVbut dehumanized,
p195
aVas in the Nazi perspective of Jews
p196
aVas vermin or lice,
p197
aVor the American perspective of Japanese as rats.
p198
aa(lp199
VStereotypes can also go awry.
p200
aVSo often they're rational and useful,
p201
aVbut sometimes they're irrational,
p202
aVthey give the wrong answers,
p203
aVand other times
p204
aVthey lead to plainly immoral consequences.
p205
aVAnd the case that's been most studied
p206
aVis the case of race.
p207
aVThere was a fascinating study
p208
aVprior to the 2008 election
p209
aVwhere social psychologists looked at the extent
p210
aVto which the candidates were associated with America,
p211
aVas in an unconscious association with the American flag.
p212
aVAnd in one of their studies they compared
p213
aVObama and McCain, and they found McCain
p214
aVis thought of as more American than Obama,
p215
aVand to some extent, people aren't  that surprised by hearing that.
p216
aVMcCain is a celebrated war hero,
p217
aVand many people would explicitly say
p218
aVhe has more of an American story than Obama.
p219
aVBut they also compared Obama
p220
aVto British Prime Minister Tony Blair,
p221
aVand they found that Blair was also thought of
p222
aVas more American than Obama,
p223
aVeven though subjects explicitly understood
p224
aVthat he's not American at all.
p225
aVBut they were responding, of course,
p226
aVto the color of his skin.
p227
aa(lp228
VThese stereotypes and biases
p229
aVhave real-world consequences,
p230
aVboth subtle and very important.
p231
aVIn one recent study, researchers
p232
aVput ads on eBay for the sale of baseball cards.
p233
aVSome of them were held by white hands,
p234
aVothers by black hands.
p235
aVThey were the same baseball cards.
p236
aVThe ones held by black hands
p237
aVgot substantially smaller bids
p238
aVthan the ones held by white hands.
p239
aVIn research done at Stanford,
p240
aVpsychologists explored the case of people
p241
aVsentenced for the murder of a white person.
p242
aVIt turns out, holding everything else constant,
p243
aVyou are considerably more likely to be executed
p244
aVif you look like the man on the right
p245
aVthan the man on the left,
p246
aVand this is in large part because
p247
aVthe man on the right looks more prototypically black,
p248
aVmore prototypically African-American,
p249
aVand this apparently influences people's decisions
p250
aVover what to do about him.
p251
aa(lp252
VSo now that we know about this,
p253
aVhow do we combat it?
p254
aVAnd there are different avenues.
p255
aVOne avenue is to appeal
p256
aVto people's emotional responses,
p257
aVto appeal to people's empathy,
p258
aVand we often do that through stories.
p259
aVSo if you are a liberal parent
p260
aVand you want to encourage your children
p261
aVto believe in the merits of nontraditional families,
p262
aVyou might give them a book like this. ["Heather Has Two Mommies"]
p263
aVIf you are conservative and have a different attitude,
p264
aVyou might give them a book like this.
p265
aV(Laughter) ["Help! Mom! There Are Liberals under My Bed!"]
p266
aVBut in general, stories can turn
p267
aVanonymous strangers into people who matter,
p268
aVand the idea that we care about people
p269
aVwhen we focus on them as individuals
p270
aVis an idea which has shown up across history.
p271
aVSo Stalin apocryphally said,
p272
aV"A single death is a tragedy,
p273
aVa million deaths is a statistic,"
p274
aVand Mother Teresa said,
p275
aV"If I look at the mass, I will never act.
p276
aVIf I look at the one, I will."
p277
aVPsychologists have explored this.
p278
aVFor instance, in one study,
p279
aVpeople were given a list of facts about a crisis,
p280
aVand it was seen how much they would donate
p281
aVto solve this crisis,
p282
aVand another group was given no facts at all
p283
aVbut they were told of an individual
p284
aVand given a name and given a face,
p285
aVand it turns out that they gave far more.
p286
aVNone of this I think is a secret
p287
aVto the people who are engaged in charity work.
p288
aVPeople don't tend to deluge people
p289
aVwith facts and statistics.
p290
aVRather, you show them faces,
p291
aVyou show them people.
p292
aVIt's possible that by extending our sympathies
p293
aVto an individual, they can spread
p294
aVto the group that the individual belongs to.
p295
aa(lp296
VThis is Harriet Beecher Stowe.
p297
aVThe story, perhaps apocryphal,
p298
aVis that President Lincoln invited her
p299
aVto the White House in the middle of the Civil War
p300
aVand said to her,
p301
aV"So you're the little lady who started this great war."
p302
aVAnd he was talking about "Uncle Tom's Cabin."
p303
aV"Uncle Tom's Cabin" is not a great book of philosophy
p304
aVor of theology or perhaps not even literature,
p305
aVbut it does a great job
p306
aVof getting people to put themselves in the shoes
p307
aVof people they wouldn't otherwise be in the shoes of,
p308
aVput themselves in the shoes of slaves.
p309
aVAnd that could well have been a catalyst
p310
aVfor great social change.
p311
aa(lp312
VMore recently, looking at America
p313
aVin the last several decades,
p314
aVthere's some reason to believe that shows like "The Cosby Show"
p315
aVradically changed American attitudes towards African-Americans,
p316
aVwhile shows like "Will and Grace" and "Modern Family"
p317
aVchanged American attitudes
p318
aVtowards gay men and women.
p319
aVI don't think it's an exaggeration to say
p320
aVthat the major catalyst in America for moral change
p321
aVhas been a situation comedy.
p322
aa(lp323
VBut it's not all emotions,
p324
aVand I want to end by appealing
p325
aVto the power of reason.
p326
aVAt some point in his wonderful book
p327
aV"The Better Angels of Our Nature,"
p328
aVSteven Pinker says,
p329
aVthe Old Testament says love thy neighbor,
p330
aVand the New Testament says love thy enemy,
p331
aVbut I don't love either one of them, not really,
p332
aVbut I don't want to kill them.
p333
aVI know I have obligations to them,
p334
aVbut my moral feelings to them, my moral beliefs
p335
aVabout how I should behave towards them,
p336
aVaren't grounded in love.
p337
aVWhat they're grounded in is the understanding of human rights,
p338
aVa belief that their life is as valuable to them
p339
aVas my life is to me,
p340
aVand to support this, he tells a story
p341
aVby the great philosopher Adam Smith,
p342
aVand I want to tell this story too,
p343
aVthough I'm going to modify it a little bit
p344
aVfor modern times.
p345
aa(lp346
VSo Adam Smith starts by asking you to imagine
p347
aVthe death of thousands of people,
p348
aVand imagine that the thousands of people
p349
aVare in a country you are not familiar with.
p350
aVIt could be China or India or a country in Africa.
p351
aVAnd Smith says, how would you respond?
p352
aVAnd you would say, well that's too bad,
p353
aVand you'd go on to the rest of your life.
p354
aVIf you were to open up The New York Times online or something,
p355
aVand discover this, and in fact this happens to us all the time,
p356
aVwe go about our lives.
p357
aVBut imagine instead, Smith says,
p358
aVyou were to learn that tomorrow
p359
aVyou were to have your little finger chopped off.
p360
aVSmith says, that would matter a lot.
p361
aVYou would not sleep that night
p362
aVwondering about that.
p363
aVSo this raises the question:
p364
aVWould you sacrifice thousands of lives
p365
aVto save your little finger?
p366
aVNow answer this in the privacy of your own head,
p367
aVbut Smith says, absolutely not,
p368
aVwhat a horrid thought.
p369
aVAnd so this raises the question,
p370
aVand so, as Smith puts it,
p371
aV"When our passive feelings are almost always
p372
aVso sordid and so selfish,
p373
aVhow comes it that our active principles
p374
aVshould often be so generous and so noble?"
p375
aVAnd Smith's answer is, "It is reason,
p376
aVprinciple, conscience.
p377
aV[This] calls to us,
p378
aVwith a voice capable of astonishing the most presumptuous of our passions,
p379
aVthat we are but one of the multitude,
p380
aVin no respect better than any other in it."
p381
aa(lp382
VAnd this last part is what is often described
p383
aVas the principle of impartiality.
p384
aVAnd this principle of impartiality manifests itself
p385
aVin all of the world's religions,
p386
aVin all of the different versions of the golden rule,
p387
aVand in all of the world's moral philosophies,
p388
aVwhich differ in many ways
p389
aVbut share the presupposition that we should judge morality
p390
aVfrom sort of an impartial point of view.
p391
aa(lp392
VThe best articulation of this view
p393
aVis actually, for me, it's not from a theologian or from a philosopher,
p394
aVbut from Humphrey Bogart
p395
aVat the end of "Casablanca."
p396
aVSo, spoiler alert, he's telling his lover
p397
aVthat they have to separate
p398
aVfor the more general good,
p399
aVand he says to her, and I won't do the accent,
p400
aVbut he says to her, "It doesn't take much to see
p401
aVthat the problems of three little people
p402
aVdon't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world."
p403
aa(lp404
VOur reason could cause us to override our passions.
p405
aVOur reason could motivate us
p406
aVto extend our empathy,
p407
aVcould motivate us to write a book like "Uncle Tom's Cabin,"
p408
aVor read a book like "Uncle Tom's Cabin,"
p409
aVand our reason can motivate us to create
p410
aVcustoms and taboos and laws
p411
aVthat will constrain us
p412
aVfrom acting upon our impulses
p413
aVwhen, as rational beings, we feel
p414
aVwe should be constrained.
p415
aVThis is what a constitution is.
p416
aVA constitution is something which was set up in the past
p417
aVthat applies now in the present,
p418
aVand what it says is,
p419
aVno matter how much we might to reelect
p420
aVa popular president for a third term,
p421
aVno matter how much white Americans might choose
p422
aVto feel that they want to reinstate the institution of slavery, we can't.
p423
aVWe have bound ourselves.
p424
aa(lp425
VAnd we bind ourselves in other ways as well.
p426
aVWe know that when it comes to choosing somebody
p427
aVfor a job, for an award,
p428
aVwe are strongly biased by their race,
p429
aVwe are biased by their gender,
p430
aVwe are biased by how attractive they are,
p431
aVand sometimes we might say, "Well fine, that's the way it should be."
p432
aVBut other times we say, "This is wrong."
p433
aVAnd so to combat this,
p434
aVwe don't just try harder,
p435
aVbut rather what we do is we set up situations
p436
aVwhere these other sources of information can't bias us,
p437
aVwhich is why many orchestras
p438
aVaudition musicians behind screens,
p439
aVso the only information they have
p440
aVis the information they believe should matter.
p441
aVI think prejudice and bias
p442
aVillustrate a fundamental duality of human nature.
p443
aVWe have gut feelings, instincts, emotions,
p444
aVand they affect our judgments and our actions
p445
aVfor good and for evil,
p446
aVbut we are also capable of rational deliberation
p447
aVand intelligent planning,
p448
aVand we can use these to, in some cases,
p449
aVaccelerate and nourish our emotions,
p450
aVand in other cases staunch them.
p451
aVAnd it's in this way
p452
aVthat reason helps us create a better world.
