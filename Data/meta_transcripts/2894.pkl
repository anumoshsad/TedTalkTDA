VI want us to start by thinking about this device,
p4
aVthe phone that's very likely in your pockets right now.
p5
aVOver 40 percent of Americans  check their phones
p6
aVwithin five minutes of waking up every morning.
p7
aVAnd then they look at it another 50 times during the day.
p8
aVGrownups consider this device to be a necessity.
p9
aa(lp10
VBut now I want you to imagine it in the hands of a three-year-old,
p11
aVand as a society, we get anxious.
p12
aVParents are very worried
p13
aVthat this device is going to stunt their children's social growth;
p14
aVthat it's going to keep them from getting up and moving;
p15
aVthat somehow,
p16
aVthis is going to disrupt childhood.
p17
aVSo, I want to challenge this attitude.
p18
aVI can envision a future
p19
aVwhere we would be excited to see a preschooler interacting with a screen.
p20
aVThese screens can get kids up and moving even more.
p21
aVThey have the power to tell us more about what a child is learning
p22
aVthan a standardized test can.
p23
aVAnd here's the really crazy thought:
p24
aVI believe that these screens have the power
p25
aVto prompt more real-life conversations
p26
aVbetween kids and their parents.
p27
aa(lp28
VNow, I was perhaps an unlikely champion for this cause.
p29
aVI studied children's literature
p30
aVbecause I was going to work with kids and books.
p31
aVBut about 20 years ago,
p32
aVI had an experience that shifted my focus.
p33
aVI was helping lead a research study about preschoolers and websites.
p34
aVAnd I walked in and was assigned a three-year-old named Maria.
p35
aVMaria had actually never seen a computer before.
p36
aVSo the first thing I had to do was teach her how to use the mouse,
p37
aVand when I opened up the screen, she moved it across the screen,
p38
aVand she stopped on a character named X the Owl.
p39
aVAnd when she did that,
p40
aVthe owl lifted his wing and waved at her.
p41
aVMaria dropped the mouse, pushed back from the table, leaped up
p42
aVand started waving frantically back at him.
p43
aVHer connection to that character
p44
aVwas visceral.
p45
aVThis wasn't a passive screen experience.
p46
aVThis was a human experience.
p47
aVAnd it was exactly appropriate for a three-year-old.
p48
aa(lp49
VI've now worked at PBS Kids for more than 15 years,
p50
aVand my work there is focused on harnessing the power of technology
p51
aVas a positive in children's lives.
p52
aVI believe that as a society, we're missing a big opportunity.
p53
aVWe're letting our fear and our skepticism
p54
aVabout these devices
p55
aVhold us back from realizing their potential
p56
aVin our children's lives.
p57
aa(lp58
VFear about kids and technology is nothing new;
p59
aVwe've been here before.
p60
aVOver 50 years ago, the debate was raging about the newly dominant media:
p61
aVthe television.
p62
aVThat box in the living room?
p63
aVIt might be separating kids from one another.
p64
aVIt might keep them away from the outside world.
p65
aVBut this is the moment when Fred Rogers,
p66
aVthe long-running host of "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood,"
p67
aVchallenged society to look at television as a tool,
p68
aVa tool that could promote emotional growth.
p69
aVHere's what he did:
p70
aVhe looked out from the screen, and he held a conversation,
p71
aVas if he were speaking to each child individually
p72
aVabout feelings.
p73
aVAnd then he would pause
p74
aVand let them think about them.
p75
aVYou can see his influence across the media landscape today,
p76
aVbut at the time, this was revolutionary.
p77
aVHe shifted the way we looked at television in the lives of children.
p78
aa(lp79
VToday it's not just one box.
p80
aVKids are surrounded by devices.
p81
aVAnd I'm also a parent \u2014 I understand this feeling of anxiety.
p82
aVBut I want us to look at three common fears
p83
aVthat parents have,
p84
aVand see if we can shift our focus
p85
aVto the opportunity that's in each of them.
p86
aa(lp87
VSo.
p88
aVFear number one:
p89
aV"Screens are passive.
p90
aVThis is going to keep our kids from getting up and moving."
p91
aVChris Kratt and Martin Kratt are zoologist brothers
p92
aVwho host a show about animals called "Wild Kratts."
p93
aVAnd they approached the PBS team to say,
p94
aV"Can we do something with those cameras
p95
aVthat are built into every device now?
p96
aVCould those cameras capture a very natural kid play pattern \u2014
p97
aVpretending to be animals?"
p98
aa(lp99
VSo we started with bats.
p100
aVAnd when kids came in to play this game,
p101
aVthey loved seeing themselves on-screen with wings.
p102
aVBut my favorite part of this,
p103
aVwhen the game was over and we turned off the screens?
p104
aVThe kids kept being bats.
p105
aVThey kept flying around the room,
p106
aVthey kept veering left and right to catch mosquitoes.
p107
aVAnd they remembered things.
p108
aVThey remembered that bats fly at night.
p109
aVAnd they remembered that when bats sleep,
p110
aVthey hang upside down and fold their wings in.
p111
aVThis game definitely got kids up and moving.
p112
aVBut also, now when kids go outside,
p113
aVdo they look at a bird and think,
p114
aV"How does a bird fly differently than I flew
p115
aVwhen I was a bat?"
p116
aVThe digital technology prompted embodied learning
p117
aVthat kids can now take out into the world.
p118
aa(lp119
VFear number two:
p120
aV"Playing games on these screens is just a waste of time.
p121
aVIt's going to distract children from their education."
p122
aVGame developers know
p123
aVthat you can learn a lot about a player's skill
p124
aVby looking at the back-end data:
p125
aVWhere did a player pause?
p126
aVWhere did they make a few mistakes before they found the right answer?
p127
aVMy team wanted to take that tool set and apply it to academic learning.
p128
aa(lp129
VOur producer in Boston, WGBH,
p130
aVcreated a series of Curious George games
p131
aVfocused on math.
p132
aVAnd researchers came in and had 80 preschoolers play these games.
p133
aVThey then gave all 80 of those preschoolers
p134
aVa standardized math test.
p135
aVWe could see early on
p136
aVthat these games were actually helping kids
p137
aVunderstand some key skills.
p138
aVBut our partners at UCLA wanted us to dig deeper.
p139
aVThey focus on data analysis and student assessment.
p140
aVAnd they wanted to take that back-end game-play data
p141
aVand see if they could use it to predict a child's math scores.
p142
aVSo they made a neural net \u2014 they essentially trained the computer
p143
aVto use this data,
p144
aVand here are the results.
p145
aVThis is a subset of the children's standardized math scores.
p146
aVAnd this
p147
aVis the computer's prediction of each child's score,
p148
aVbased on playing some Curious George games.
p149
aVThe prediction is astonishingly accurate,
p150
aVespecially considering the fact that these games weren't built
p151
aVfor assessment.
p152
aVThe team that did this study believes that games like these
p153
aVcan teach us more about a child's cognitive learning
p154
aVthan a standardized test can.
p155
aVWhat if games could reduce testing time in the classroom?
p156
aVWhat if they could reduce testing anxiety?
p157
aVHow could they give teachers snapshots of insight
p158
aVto help them better focus their individualized learning?
p159
aa(lp160
VSo the third fear I want to address
p161
aVis the one that I think is often the biggest.
p162
aVAnd that's this:
p163
aV"These screens are isolating me from my child."
p164
aVLet's play out a scenario.
p165
aVLet's say that you are a parent,
p166
aVand you need 25 minutes of uninterrupted time
p167
aVto get dinner ready.
p168
aVAnd in order to do that, you hand a tablet to your three-year-old.
p169
aVNow, this is a moment where you probably feel very guilty
p170
aVabout what you just did.
p171
aa(lp172
VBut now imagine this:
p173
aVTwenty minutes later, you receive a text message.
p174
aVon that cell phone that's always within arm's reach.
p175
aVAnd it says: "Alex just matched five rhyming words.
p176
aVAsk him to play this game with you.
p177
aVCan you think of a word that rhymes with 'cat'?
p178
aVOr how about 'ball'?"
p179
aVIn our studies, when parents receive simple tips like these,
p180
aVthey felt empowered.
p181
aVThey were so excited
p182
aVto play these games at the dinner table with their kids.
p183
aVAnd the kids loved it, too.
p184
aVNot only did it feel like magic that their parents knew
p185
aVwhat they had been playing,
p186
aVkids love to play games with their parents.
p187
aVJust the act of talking to kids about their media
p188
aVcan be incredibly powerful.
p189
aa(lp190
VLast summer, Texas Tech University published a study
p191
aVthat the show "Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood" could promote
p192
aVthe development of empathy among children.
p193
aVBut there was a really important catch to this study:
p194
aVthe greatest benefit was only when parents talked to kids
p195
aVabout what they watched.
p196
aVNeither just watching
p197
aVnor just talking about it was enough;
p198
aVit was the combination that was key.
p199
aVSo when I read this study,
p200
aVI started thinking about
p201
aVhow rarely parents of preschoolers actually talk to kids about the content
p202
aVof what they're playing and what they're watching.
p203
aa(lp204
VAnd so I decided to try it with my four-year-old.
p205
aVI said,
p206
aV"Were you playing a car game earlier today?"
p207
aVAnd Benjamin perked up and said,
p208
aV"Yes! And did you see that I made my car out of a pickle?
p209
aVIt was really hard to open the trunk."
p210
aa(lp211
V(Laughter)
p212
aa(lp213
VThis hilarious conversation about what was fun in the game
p214
aVand what could have been better
p215
aVcontinued all the way to school that morning.
p216
aa(lp217
VI'm not here to suggest to you that all digital media is great for kids.
p218
aVThere are legitimate reasons for us to be concerned
p219
aVabout the current state of children's content
p220
aVon these screens.
p221
aVAnd it's right for us to be thinking about balance:
p222
aVWhere do screens fit against all the other things
p223
aVthat a child needs to do to learn and to grow?
p224
aVBut when we fixate on our fears about it,
p225
aVwe forget a really major point,
p226
aVand that is, that kids are living in the same world that we live in,
p227
aVthe world where the grownups check their phones
p228
aVmore than 50 times a day.
p229
aa(lp230
VScreens are a part of children's lives.
p231
aVAnd if we pretend that they aren't,
p232
aVor if we get overwhelmed by our fear,
p233
aVkids are never going to learn how and why to use them.
p234
aVWhat if we start raising our expectations
p235
aVfor this media?
p236
aVWhat if we start talking to kids regularly
p237
aVabout the content on these screens?
p238
aVWhat if we start looking for the positive impacts
p239
aVthat this technology can have in our children's lives?
p240
aVThat's when the potential of these tools can become a reality.
p241
aa(lp242
