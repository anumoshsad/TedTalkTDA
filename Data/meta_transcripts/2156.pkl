VThe power of yet.
p4
aa(lp5
VI heard about a high school in Chicago
p6
aVwhere students had to pass a certain number of courses to graduate,
p7
aVand if they didn't pass a course, they got the grade "Not Yet."
p8
aVAnd I thought that was fantastic,
p9
aVbecause if you get a failing grade, you think, I'm nothing, I'm nowhere.
p10
aVBut if you get the grade "Not Yet",
p11
aVyou understand that you're on a learning curve.
p12
aVIt gives you a path into the future.
p13
aa(lp14
V"Not Yet" also gave me insight
p15
aVinto a critical event early in my career,
p16
aVa real turning point.
p17
aVI wanted to see
p18
aVhow children coped with challenge and difficulty,
p19
aVso I gave 10-year-olds
p20
aVproblems that were slightly too hard for them.
p21
aVSome of them reacted in a shockingly positive way.
p22
aVThey said things like, "I love a challenge,"
p23
aVor, "You know, I was hoping this would be informative."
p24
aVThey understood that their abilities could be developed.
p25
aVThey had what I call a growth mindset.
p26
aVBut other students felt it was tragic, catastrophic.
p27
aVFrom their more fixed mindset perspective,
p28
aVtheir intelligence had been up for judgment,
p29
aVand they failed.
p30
aVInstead of luxuriating in the power of yet,
p31
aVthey were gripped in the tyranny of now.
p32
aa(lp33
VSo what do they do next?
p34
aVI'll tell you what they do next.
p35
aVIn one study, they told us they would probably cheat the next time
p36
aVinstead of studying more if they failed a test.
p37
aVIn another study, after a failure,
p38
aVthey looked for someone who did worse than they did
p39
aVso they could feel really good about themselves.
p40
aVAnd in study after study, they have run from difficulty.
p41
aVScientists measured the electrical activity from the brain
p42
aVas students confronted an error.
p43
aVOn the left, you see the fixed-mindset students.
p44
aVThere's hardly any activity.
p45
aVThey run from the error.
p46
aVThey don't engage with it.
p47
aVBut on the right, you have the students with the growth mindset,
p48
aVthe idea that abilities can be developed.
p49
aVThey engage deeply.
p50
aVTheir brain is on fire with yet.
p51
aVThey engage deeply.
p52
aVThey process the error.
p53
aVThey learn from it and they correct it.
p54
aa(lp55
VHow are we raising our children?
p56
aVAre we raising them for now instead of yet?
p57
aVAre we raising kids who are obsessed with getting As?
p58
aVAre we raising kids who don't know how to dream big dreams?
p59
aVTheir biggest goal is getting the next A, or the next test score?
p60
aVAnd are they carrying this need for constant validation with them
p61
aVinto their future lives?
p62
aVMaybe, because employers are coming to me and saying,
p63
aV"We have already raised a generation
p64
aVof young workers who can't get through the day
p65
aVwithout an award."
p66
aa(lp67
VSo what can we do?
p68
aVHow can we build that bridge to yet?
p69
aa(lp70
VHere are some things we can do.
p71
aVFirst of all, we can praise wisely,
p72
aVnot praising intelligence or talent.
p73
aVThat has failed.
p74
aVDon't do that anymore.
p75
aVBut praising the process that kids engage in,
p76
aVtheir effort, their strategies, their focus, their perseverance,
p77
aVtheir improvement.
p78
aVThis process praise creates kids who are hardy and resilient.
p79
aa(lp80
VThere are other ways to reward yet.
p81
aVWe recently teamed up with game scientists
p82
aVfrom the University of Washington
p83
aVto create a new online math game that rewarded yet.
p84
aVIn this game, students were rewarded for effort, strategy and progress.
p85
aVThe usual math game
p86
aVrewards you for getting answers right, right now,
p87
aVbut this game rewarded process.
p88
aVAnd we got more effort,
p89
aVmore strategies,
p90
aVmore engagement over longer periods of time,
p91
aVand more perseverance when they hit really, really hard problems.
p92
aa(lp93
VJust the words "yet" or "not yet," we're finding,
p94
aVgive kids greater confidence,
p95
aVgive them a path into the future that creates greater persistence.
p96
aVAnd we can actually change students' mindsets.
p97
aVIn one study, we taught them
p98
aVthat every time they push out of their comfort zone
p99
aVto learn something new and difficult,
p100
aVthe neurons in their brain can form new, stronger connections,
p101
aVand over time, they can get smarter.
p102
aa(lp103
VLook what happened: In this study,
p104
aVstudents who were not taught this growth mindset
p105
aVcontinued to show declining grades over this difficult school transition,
p106
aVbut those who were taught this lesson showed a sharp rebound in their grades.
p107
aVWe have shown this now, this kind of improvement,
p108
aVwith thousands and thousands of kids, especially struggling students.
p109
aa(lp110
VSo let's talk about equality.
p111
aVIn our country, there are groups of students
p112
aVwho chronically underperform,
p113
aVfor example, children in inner cities,
p114
aVor children on Native American reservations.
p115
aVAnd they've done so poorly for so long
p116
aVthat many people think it's inevitable.
p117
aVBut when educators create growth mindset classrooms
p118
aVsteeped in yet,
p119
aVequality happens.
p120
aVAnd here are just a few examples.
p121
aVIn one year, a kindergarten class in Harlem, New York
p122
aVscored in the 95th percentile
p123
aVon the national achievement test.
p124
aVMany of those kids could not hold a pencil
p125
aVwhen they arrived at school.
p126
aVIn one year,
p127
aVfourth-grade students in the South Bronx, way behind,
p128
aVbecame the number one fourth-grade class in the state of New York
p129
aVon the state math test.
p130
aVIn a year, to a year and a half,
p131
aVNative American students in a school on a reservation
p132
aVwent from the bottom of their district to the top,
p133
aVand that district included affluent sections of Seattle.
p134
aVSo the Native kids outdid the Microsoft kids.
p135
aa(lp136
VThis happened because the meaning of effort and difficulty were transformed.
p137
aVBefore, effort and difficulty
p138
aVmade them feel dumb, made them feel like giving up,
p139
aVbut now, effort and difficulty,
p140
aVthat's when their neurons are making new connections,
p141
aVstronger connections.
p142
aVThat's when they're getting smarter.
p143
aa(lp144
VI received a letter recently from a 13-year-old boy.
p145
aVHe said, "Dear Professor Dweck,
p146
aVI appreciate that your writing is based on solid scientific research,
p147
aVand that's why I decided to put it into practice.
p148
aVI put more effort into my schoolwork,
p149
aVinto my relationship with my family,
p150
aVand into my relationship with kids at school,
p151
aVand I experienced great improvement in all of those areas.
p152
aVI now realize I've wasted most of my life."
p153
aa(lp154
VLet's not waste any more lives,
p155
aVbecause once we know
p156
aVthat abilities are capable of such growth,
p157
aVit becomes a basic human right for children, all children,
p158
aVto live in places that create that growth,
p159
aVto live in places filled with "yet".
p160
aa(lp161
