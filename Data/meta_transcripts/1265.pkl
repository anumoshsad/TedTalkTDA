VHi. Today, I'm going to take you through glimpses
p4
aVof about eight of my projects,
p5
aVdone in collaboration with Danish artist Soren Pors.
p6
aVWe call ourselves Pors and Rao,
p7
aVand we live and work in India.
p8
aa(lp9
VI'd like to begin with my very first object,
p10
aVwhich I call "The Uncle Phone."
p11
aVAnd it was inspired by my uncle's peculiar habit
p12
aVof constantly asking me to do things for him,
p13
aValmost like I were an extension of his body \u2014
p14
aVto turn on the lights or to bring him a glass of water,
p15
aVa pack of cigarettes.
p16
aVAnd as I grew up, it became worse and worse,
p17
aVAnd I started to think of it as a form of control.
p18
aVBut of course, I could never say anything,
p19
aVbecause the uncle is a respected figure
p20
aVin the Indian family.
p21
aVAnd the situation that irked me and mystified me the most
p22
aVwas his use of a landline telephone.
p23
aVHe would hold on to the receiver and expect me to dial a number for him.
p24
aVAnd so as a response and as a gift to my uncle,
p25
aVI made him "The Uncle Phone."
p26
aVIt's so long that it requires two people to use it.
p27
aVIt's exactly the way my uncle uses a phone that's designed for one person.
p28
aa(lp29
VBut the problem is that, when I left home and went to college,
p30
aVI started missing his commands.
p31
aVAnd so I made him a golden typewriter
p32
aVthrough which he could dispense his commands
p33
aVto nephews and nieces around the world as an email.
p34
aVSo what he had to do was take a piece of paper, roll it into the carriage,
p35
aVtype his email or command and pull the paper out.
p36
aVThis device would automatically send the intended person
p37
aVthe letter as an email.
p38
aVSo here you can see, we embedded a lot of electronics
p39
aVthat understands all of the mechanical actions
p40
aVand converts it to digital.
p41
aVSo my uncle is only dealing with a mechanical interface.
p42
aVAnd of course, the object had to be very grand and have a sense of ritualism,
p43
aVthe way my uncle likes it.
p44
aa(lp45
VThe next work is a sound-sensitive installation
p46
aVthat we affectionately call "The Pygmies."
p47
aVAnd we wanted to work with a notion of being
p48
aVsurrounded by a tribe of very shy, sensitive and sweet creatures.
p49
aVSo how it works is we have these panels, which we have on the wall,
p50
aVand behind them, we have these little creatures which hide.
p51
aVAnd as soon as it's silent, they sort of creep out.
p52
aVAnd if it's even more silent, they stretch their necks out.
p53
aVAnd at the slightest sound, they hide back again.
p54
aa(lp55
VSo we had these panels on three walls of a room.
p56
aVAnd we had over 500 of these little pygmies hiding behind them.
p57
aVSo this is how it works.
p58
aVThis is a video prototype.
p59
aVSo when it's quiet, it's sort of coming out from behind the panels.
p60
aVAnd they hear like humans do, or real creatures do.
p61
aVSo they get immune to sounds that scare them after awhile.
p62
aVAnd they don't react to background sounds.
p63
aVYou'll hear a train in moment that they don't react to.
p64
aV(Noise)
p65
aVBut they react to foreground sounds. You'll hear that in a second.
p66
aV(Whistling)
p67
aVSo we worked very hard
p68
aVto make them as lifelike as possible.
p69
aVSo each pygmy has its own behavior, psyche,
p70
aVmood swings, personalities and so on.
p71
aVSo this is a very early prototype.
p72
aVOf course, it got much better after that.
p73
aVAnd we made them react to people,
p74
aVbut we found that people were being quite playful and childlike with them.
p75
aa(lp76
VThis is a video installation called "The Missing Person."
p77
aVAnd we were quite intrigued
p78
aVwith playing with the notion of invisibility.
p79
aVHow would it be possible to experience a sense of invisibility?
p80
aVSo we worked with a company
p81
aVthat specializes in camera surveillance,
p82
aVand we asked them to develop a piece of software with us,
p83
aVusing a camera
p84
aVthat could look at people in the room, track them
p85
aVand replace one person with the background, rendering them invisible.
p86
aa(lp87
VSo I'm just going to show you a very early prototype.
p88
aVOn the right side you can see my colleague Soren,
p89
aVwho's actually in the space.
p90
aVAnd on the left side, you'll see the processed video
p91
aVwhere the camera has made him invisible.
p92
aVSoren enters the room. Pop! He goes invisible.
p93
aVAnd you can see that the camera is tracking him and erasing.
p94
aVIt's a very early video,
p95
aVso we haven't yet dealt with the overlap and all of that,
p96
aVbut that got refined pretty soon, later.
p97
aVSo how we used it was in a room where we had a camera looking into the space,
p98
aVand we had one monitor, one on each wall.
p99
aVAnd as people walked into the room,
p100
aVthey would see themselves in the monitor, except with one difference:
p101
aVone person was constantly invisible
p102
aVwherever they moved in the room.
p103
aa(lp104
VSo this is a work called "The Sun Shadow."
p105
aVAnd it was almost like a sheet of paper,
p106
aVlike a cutout of a childlike drawing
p107
aVof an oil spill or a sun.
p108
aVAnd from the front, this object appeared to be very strong and robust,
p109
aVand from the side, it almost seemed very weak.
p110
aVSo people would walking into the room and they'd almost ignore it,
p111
aVthinking it was some crap laying around.
p112
aVBut as soon as they passed by,
p113
aVit would start to climb up the wall in jerky fashion.
p114
aVAnd it would get exhausted, and it would collapse every time.
p115
aa(lp116
V(Laughter)
p117
aa(lp118
VSo this work
p119
aVis a caricature of an upside-down man.
p120
aVHis head is so heavy, full of heavy thoughts,
p121
aVthat it's sort of fallen into his hat,
p122
aVand his body's grown out of him almost like a plant.
p123
aVWell what he does is he moves around
p124
aVin a very drunken fashion on his head
p125
aVin a very unpredictable and extremely slow movement.
p126
aVAnd it's kind of constrained by that circle.
p127
aVBecause if that circle weren't there, and the floor was very even,
p128
aVit would start to wander about in the space.
p129
aVAnd there's no wires.
p130
aVSo I'll just show you an instance \u2014
p131
aVso when people enter the room, it activates this object.
p132
aVAnd it very slowly, over a few minutes,
p133
aVsort of painfully goes up,
p134
aVand then it gains momentum
p135
aVand it looks like it's almost about to fall.
p136
aVAnd this is an important moment,
p137
aVbecause we wanted to instill in the viewer
p138
aVan instinct to almost go and help, or save the subject.
p139
aVBut it doesn't really need it,
p140
aVbecause it, again, sort of manages to pull itself up.
p141
aa(lp142
VSo this work was a real technical challenge for us,
p143
aVand we worked very hard, like most of our works, over years
p144
aVto get the mechanics right and the equilibrium and the dynamics.
p145
aVAnd it was very important for us
p146
aVto establish the exact moment that it would fall,
p147
aVbecause if we made it in a way that it would topple over,
p148
aVthen it would damage itself,
p149
aVand if it didn't fall enough, it wouldn't instill that fatalism,
p150
aVor that sense of wanting to go and help it.
p151
aVSo I'm going to show you a very quick video
p152
aVwhere we are doing a test scenario \u2014 it's much faster.
p153
aVThat's my colleague. He's let it go.
p154
aVNow he's getting nervous, so he's going to go catch it.
p155
aVBut he doesn't need to,
p156
aVbecause it manages to lift itself up on its own.
p157
aa(lp158
VSo this is a work that we were very intrigued with,
p159
aVworking with the aesthetic of fur
p160
aVembedded with thousands of tiny different sizes
p161
aVof fiber optics, which twinkle like the night sky.
p162
aVAnd it's at the scale of the night sky.
p163
aVSo we wrapped this around a blob-like form,
p164
aVwhich is in the shape of a teddy bear,
p165
aVwhich was hanging from the ceiling.
p166
aVAnd the idea was to sort of contrast
p167
aVsomething very cold and distant and abstract like the universe
p168
aVinto the familiar form of a teddy bear,
p169
aVwhich is very comforting and intimate.
p170
aVAnd the idea was that at some point
p171
aVyou would stop looking at the form of a teddy bear
p172
aVand you would almost perceive it to be a hole in the space,
p173
aVand as if you were looking out into the twinkling night sky.
p174
aa(lp175
VSo this is the last work, and a work in progress,
p176
aVand it's called "Space Filler."
p177
aVWell imagine a small cube that's about this big
p178
aVstanding in front of you in the middle of the room,
p179
aVand as you approached it, it tried to intimidate you
p180
aVby growing into a cube
p181
aVthat's twice its height and [eight] times its volume.
p182
aVAnd so this object is constantly expanding and contracting
p183
aVto create a dynamic with people moving around it \u2014
p184
aValmost like it were trying
p185
aVto conceal a secret within its seams or something.
p186
aa(lp187
VSo we work with a lot of technology,
p188
aVbut we don't really love technology,
p189
aVbecause it gives us a lot of pain in our work over years and years.
p190
aVBut we use it because we're interested
p191
aVin the way that it can help us
p192
aVto express the emotions and behavioral patterns
p193
aVin these creatures that we create.
p194
aVAnd once a creature pops into our minds,
p195
aVit's almost like the process of creation
p196
aVis to discover the way this creature really wants to exist
p197
aVand what form it wants to take and what way it wants to move.
