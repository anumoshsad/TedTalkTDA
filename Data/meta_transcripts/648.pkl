VI have a very difficult task.
p4
aVI'm a spectroscopist.
p5
aVI have to talk about astronomy without showing you
p6
aVany single image of nebulae or galaxies, etc.
p7
aVbecause my job is spectroscopy.
p8
aVI never deal with images.
p9
aVBut I'll try to convince you
p10
aVthat spectroscopy is actually something which can
p11
aVchange this world.
p12
aVSpectroscopy can probably answer the question,
p13
aV"Is there anybody out there?"
p14
aVAre we alone? SETI.
p15
aVIt's not very fun to do spectroscopy.
p16
aa(lp17
VOne of my colleagues in Bulgaria,
p18
aVNevena Markova, spent about 20 years
p19
aVstudying these profiles.
p20
aVAnd she published 42 articles
p21
aVjust dedicated to the subject.
p22
aVCan you imagine? Day and night, thinking,
p23
aVobserving, the same star for 20 years
p24
aVis incredible.
p25
aVBut we are crazy. We do these things.
p26
aV(Laughter)
p27
aa(lp28
VAnd I'm not that far.
p29
aVI spent about eight months working on these profiles.
p30
aVBecause I've noticed
p31
aVa very small symmetry
p32
aVin the profile of one of the planet host stars.
p33
aVAnd I thought, well maybe there is Lithium-6 in this star,
p34
aVwhich is an indication that this star
p35
aVhas swallowed a planet.
p36
aVBecause apparently you can't have this fragile isotope
p37
aVof Lithium-6 in the atmospheres of sun-like stars.
p38
aVBut you have it in planets and asteroids.
p39
aVSo if you engulf planet or large number of asteroids,
p40
aVyou will have this Lithium-6 isotope
p41
aVin the spectrum of the star.
p42
aVSo I invested more than eight months
p43
aVjust studying the profile of this star.
p44
aa(lp45
VAnd actually it's amazing,
p46
aVbecause I got phone calls from many reporters asking,
p47
aV"Have you actually seen the planet going into a star?"
p48
aVBecause they thought that if you are having a telescope,
p49
aVyou are an astronomer so what you are doing
p50
aVis actually looking in a telescope.
p51
aVAnd you might have seen the planet going into a star.
p52
aVAnd I was saying, "No, excuse me.
p53
aVWhat I see is this one."
p54
aV(Laughter)
p55
aVIt's just incredible. Because nobody understood really.
p56
aVI bet that there were very few people
p57
aVwho really understood what I'm talking about.
p58
aVBecause this is the indication that the planet went into the star.
p59
aVIt's amazing.
p60
aa(lp61
VThe power of spectroscopy
p62
aVwas actually realized
p63
aVby Pink Floyd already in 1973.
p64
aV(Laughter)
p65
aVBecause they actually said that
p66
aVyou can get any color you like
p67
aVin a spectrum.
p68
aVAnd all you need is time and money
p69
aVto make your spectrograph.
p70
aVThis is the number one high resolution,
p71
aVmost precise spectrograph on this planet, called HARPS,
p72
aVwhich is actually used to detect
p73
aVextrasolar planets and sound waves
p74
aVin the atmospheres of stars.
p75
aa(lp76
VHow we get spectra?
p77
aVI'm sure most of you know from school physics
p78
aVthat it's basically splitting a white light
p79
aVinto colors.
p80
aVAnd if you have a liquid hot mass,
p81
aVit will produce something which we call a continuous spectrum.
p82
aVA hot gas is producing emission lines only,
p83
aVno continuum.
p84
aVAnd if you place a cool gas in front of a
p85
aVhot source,
p86
aVyou will see certain patterns
p87
aVwhich we call absorption lines.
p88
aVWhich is used actually to identify chemical elements
p89
aVin a cool matter,
p90
aVwhich is absorbing exactly at those frequencies.
p91
aa(lp92
VNow, what we can do with the spectra?
p93
aVWe can actually study line-of-sight velocities
p94
aVof cosmic objects.
p95
aVAnd we can also study chemical composition
p96
aVand physical parameters of stars,
p97
aVgalaxies, nebulae.
p98
aVA star is the most simple object.
p99
aVIn the core, we have thermonuclear reactions going on,
p100
aVcreating chemical elements.
p101
aVAnd we have a cool atmosphere.
p102
aVIt's cool for me.
p103
aVCool in my terms is three or four or five thousand degrees.
p104
aVMy colleagues in infra-red astronomy
p105
aVcall minus 200 Kelvin is cool for them.
p106
aVBut you know, everything is relative.
p107
aVSo for me 5,000 degrees is pretty cool.
p108
aV(Laughter)
p109
aa(lp110
VThis is the spectrum of the Sun \u2014
p111
aV24,000 spectral lines,
p112
aVand about 15 percent of these lines is not yet identified.
p113
aVIt is amazing. So we are in the 21st century,
p114
aVand we still cannot properly understand
p115
aVthe spectrum of the sun.
p116
aVSometimes we have to deal with
p117
aVjust one tiny, weak spectral line
p118
aVto measure the composition of that chemical element in the atmosphere.
p119
aVFor instance, you see the spectral line of the gold
p120
aVis the only spectral line in the spectrum of the Sun.
p121
aVAnd we use this weak feature
p122
aVto measure the composition
p123
aVof gold in the atmosphere of the Sun.
p124
aa(lp125
VAnd now this is a work in progress.
p126
aVWe have been dealing with a similarly very weak feature,
p127
aVwhich belongs to osmium.
p128
aVIt's a heavy element produced in thermonuclear
p129
aVexplosions of supernovae.
p130
aVIt's the only place where you can produce, actually, osmium.
p131
aVJust comparing the composition of osmium
p132
aVin one of the planet host stars,
p133
aVwe want to understand why there is so much
p134
aVof this element.
p135
aVPerhaps we even think that maybe
p136
aVsupernova explosions trigger formations of planets and stars.
p137
aVIt can be an indication.
p138
aa(lp139
VThe other day, my colleague from Berkeley,
p140
aVGibor Basri, emailed me
p141
aVa very interesting spectrum,
p142
aVasking me, "Can you have a look at this?"
p143
aVAnd I couldn't sleep, next two weeks,
p144
aVwhen I saw the huge amount of oxygen
p145
aVand other elements in the spectrum of the stars.
p146
aVI knew that there is nothing like that observed in the galaxy.
p147
aVIt was incredible. The only conclusion we could make from this
p148
aVis clear evidence that there was a supernova explosion
p149
aVin this system, which polluted the atmosphere
p150
aVof this star.
p151
aVAnd later a black hole was formed
p152
aVin a binary system,
p153
aVwhich is still there with a mass of about
p154
aVfive solar masses.
p155
aVThis was considered as first evidence that actually black holes
p156
aVcome from supernovae explosions.
p157
aa(lp158
VMy colleagues, comparing composition of chemical elements
p159
aVin different galactic stars,
p160
aVactually discovered alien stars in our galaxy.
p161
aVIt's amazing that you can go so far
p162
aVsimply studying the chemical composition of stars.
p163
aVThey actually said that one of the stars you see in the spectra
p164
aVis an alien. It comes from a different galaxy.
p165
aVThere is interaction of galaxies. We know this.
p166
aVAnd sometimes they just capture stars.
p167
aa(lp168
VYou've heard about solar flares.
p169
aVWe were very surprised to discover
p170
aVa super flare,
p171
aVa flare which is thousands of millions of times
p172
aVmore powerful than those we see in the Sun.
p173
aVIn one of the binary stars in our galaxy
p174
aVcalled FH Leo,
p175
aVwe discovered the super flare.
p176
aVAnd later we went to study the spectral stars
p177
aVto see is there anything strange with these objects.
p178
aVAnd we found that everything is normal.
p179
aVThese stars are normal like the Sun. Age, everything was normal.
p180
aVSo this is a mystery.
p181
aVIt's one of the mysteries we still have, super flares.
p182
aVAnd there are six or seven similar cases
p183
aVreported in the literature.
p184
aa(lp185
VNow to go ahead with this,
p186
aVwe really need to understand chemical evolution of the universe.
p187
aVIt's very complicated. I don't really want you to
p188
aVtry to understand what is here.
p189
aV(Laughter)
p190
aVBut it's to show you how complicated is the whole story
p191
aVof the production of chemical elements.
p192
aVYou have two channels \u2014
p193
aVthe massive stars and low-mass stars \u2014
p194
aVproducing and recycling matter and chemical elements in the universe.
p195
aVAnd doing this for 14 billion years,
p196
aVwe end up with this picture,
p197
aVwhich is a very important graph,
p198
aVshowing relative abundances of chemical elements
p199
aVin sun-like stars
p200
aVand in the interstellar medium.
p201
aa(lp202
VSo which means that it's really impossible
p203
aVto find an object where you find about 10 times more sulfur than silicon,
p204
aVfive times more calcium than oxygen. It's just impossible.
p205
aVAnd if you find one, I will say that
p206
aVthis is something related to SETI,
p207
aVbecause naturally you can't do it.
p208
aVDoppler Effect is something very important
p209
aVfrom fundamental physics.
p210
aVAnd this is related to the change of the frequency
p211
aVof a moving source.
p212
aVThe Doppler Effect is used to discover extrasolar planets.
p213
aa(lp214
VThe precision which we need
p215
aVto discover a Jupiter-like planet
p216
aVaround a sun-like star
p217
aVis something like 28.4 meters per second.
p218
aVAnd we need nine centimeters per second
p219
aVto detect an Earth-like planet.
p220
aVThis can be done with the future spectrographs.
p221
aVI, myself, I'm actually involved in the team
p222
aVwhich is developing a CODEX,
p223
aVhigh resolution, future generation spectrograph
p224
aVfor the 42 meter E-ELT telescope.
p225
aVAnd this is going to be an instrument
p226
aVto detect Earth-like planets
p227
aVaround sun-like stars.
p228
aVIt is an amazing tool called astroseismology
p229
aVwhere we can detect sound waves
p230
aVin the atmospheres of stars.
p231
aa(lp232
VThis is the sound of an Alpha Cen.
p233
aVWe can detect sound waves
p234
aVin the atmospheres of sun-like stars.
p235
aVThose waves have frequencies
p236
aVin infrasound domain, the sound actually nobody knows, domain.
p237
aVComing back to the most important question,
p238
aV"Is there anybody out there?"
p239
aVThis is closely related
p240
aVto tectonic and volcanic activity of planets.
p241
aVConnection between life
p242
aVand radioactive nuclei
p243
aVis straightforward.
p244
aVNo life without tectonic activity,
p245
aVwithout volcanic activity.
p246
aVAnd we know very well that geothermal energy
p247
aVis mostly produced by decay of uranium, thorium, and potassium.
p248
aa(lp249
VHow to measure, if we have planets
p250
aVwhere the amount of those elements is small,
p251
aVso those planets are tectonically dead,
p252
aVthere cannot be life.
p253
aVIf there is too much uranium or potassium or thorium,
p254
aVprobably, again, there would be no life.
p255
aVBecause can you imagine everything boiling?
p256
aVIt's too much energy on a planet.
p257
aVNow, we have been measuring abundance
p258
aVof thorium in one of the stars with extrasolar planets.
p259
aVIt's exactly the same game. A very tiny feature.
p260
aa(lp261
VWe are actually trying to measure this profile
p262
aVand to detect thorium.
p263
aVIt's very tough. It's very tough.
p264
aVAnd you have to, first you have to convince yourself.
p265
aVThen you have to convince your colleagues.
p266
aVAnd then you have to convince the whole world
p267
aVthat you have actually detected something like this
p268
aVin the atmosphere of an extrasolar planet
p269
aVhost star somewhere in 100 parsec away from here.
p270
aVIt's really difficult.
p271
aVBut if you want to know about a life on extrasolar planets,
p272
aVyou have to do this job.
p273
aVBecause you have to know how much of radioactive element you have
p274
aVin those systems.
p275
aa(lp276
VThe one way to discover about aliens
p277
aVis to tune your radio telescope and listen to the signals.
p278
aVIf you receive something interesting,
p279
aVwell that's what SETI does actually,
p280
aVwhat SETI has been doing for many years.
p281
aVI think the most promising way
p282
aVis to go for biomarkers.
p283
aVYou can see the spectrum of the Earth, this Earthshine spectrum,
p284
aVand that is a very clear signal.
p285
aVThe slope which is coming, which we call a Red Edge,
p286
aVis a detection of vegetated area.
p287
aVIt's amazing that we can detect vegetation
p288
aVfrom a spectrum.
p289
aVNow imagine doing this test
p290
aVfor other planets.
p291
aa(lp292
VNow very recently, very recently,
p293
aVI'm talking about last six, seven, eight months,
p294
aVwater, methane, carbon dioxide
p295
aVhave been detected in the spectrum
p296
aVof a planet outside the solar system.
p297
aVIt's amazing. So this is the power of spectroscopy.
p298
aVYou can actually go and detect
p299
aVand study a chemical composition of planets
p300
aVfar, far, far from solar system.
p301
aVWe have to detect oxygen or ozone
p302
aVto make sure that we have all necessary conditions
p303
aVto have life.
p304
aa(lp305
VCosmic miracles are something
p306
aVwhich can be related to SETI.
p307
aVNow imagine an object, amazing object,
p308
aVor something which we cannot explain
p309
aVwhen we just stand up and say,
p310
aV"Look, we give up. Physics doesn't work."
p311
aVSo it's something which you can always refer to SETI and say,
p312
aV"Well, somebody must be doing this, somehow."
p313
aa(lp314
VAnd with the known physics etc,
p315
aVit's something actually which has been pointed out
p316
aVby Frank Drake,
p317
aVmany years ago, and Shklovsky.
p318
aVIf you see, in the spectrum of a planet host star,
p319
aVif you see strange chemical elements,
p320
aVit can be a signal from a civilization
p321
aVwhich is there and they want to signal about it.
p322
aVThey want to actually signal their presence
p323
aVthrough these spectral lines,
p324
aVin the spectrum of a star, in different ways.
p325
aa(lp326
VThere can be different ways doing this.
p327
aVOne is, for instance, technetium
p328
aVis a radioactive element
p329
aVwith a decay time of 4.2 million years.
p330
aVIf you suddenly observe technetium
p331
aVin a sun-like star,
p332
aVyou can be sure that somebody has put this
p333
aVelement in the atmosphere,
p334
aVbecause in a natural way it is impossible to do this.
p335
aVNow we are reviewing the spectra of about
p336
aV300 stars with extrasolar planets.
p337
aVAnd we are doing this job since 2000
p338
aVand it's a very heavy project.
p339
aVWe have been working very hard.
p340
aVAnd we have some interesting cases,
p341
aVcandidates, so on, things which we can't really explain.
p342
aVAnd I hope in the near future
p343
aVwe can confirm this.
p344
aa(lp345
VSo the main question: "Are we alone?"
p346
aVI think it will not come from UFOs.
p347
aVIt will not come from radio signals.
p348
aVI think it will come from a spectrum like this.
p349
aVIt is the spectrum of a planet like Earth,
p350
aVshowing a presence of nitrogen dioxide,
p351
aVas a clear signal of life,
p352
aVand oxygen and ozone.
p353
aVIf, one day, and I think it will be
p354
aVwithin 15 years from now, or 20 years.
p355
aVIf we discover a spectrum like this
p356
aVwe can be sure that there is life on that planet.
p357
aVIn about five years we will discover
p358
aVplanets like Earth, around sun-like stars,
p359
aVthe same distance as the Earth from the Sun.
p360
aVIt will take about five years.
p361
aVAnd then we will need another 10, 15 years
p362
aVwith space projects
p363
aVto get the spectra of Earth-like planets like the one I showed you.
p364
aVAnd if we see the nitrogen dioxide
p365
aVand oxygen,
p366
aVI think we have the perfect E.T.
p367
aVThank you very much.
