VI normally teach courses on
p4
aVhow to rebuild states after war.
p5
aVBut today I've got a personal story to share with you.
p6
aVThis is a picture of my family,
p7
aVmy four siblings \u2014 my mom and I \u2014 taken in 1977.
p8
aVAnd we're actually Cambodians.
p9
aVAnd this picture is taken in Vietnam.
p10
aVSo how did a Cambodian family end up in Vietnam in 1977?
p11
aVWell to explain that, I've got a short video clip
p12
aVto explain the Khmer Rouge regime
p13
aVduring 1975 and 1979.
p14
aa(lp15
VVideo: April 17th, 1975.
p16
aVThe communist Khmer Rouge
p17
aVenters Phnom Penh to liberate their people
p18
aVfrom the encroaching conflict in Vietnam,
p19
aVand American bombing campaigns.
p20
aVLed by peasant-born Pol Pot,
p21
aVthe Khmer Rouge evacuates people to the countryside
p22
aVin order to create a rural communist utopia,
p23
aVmuch like Mao Tse-tung's Cultural Revolution in China.
p24
aVThe Khmer Rouge closes the doors to the outside world.
p25
aVBut after four years the grim truth seeps out.
p26
aVIn a country of only seven million people,
p27
aVone and a half million were murdered by their own leaders,
p28
aVtheir bodies piled in the mass graves of the killing fields.
p29
aa(lp30
VSophal Ear: So, notwithstanding the 1970s narration,
p31
aVon April 17th 1975
p32
aVwe lived in Phnom Penh.
p33
aVAnd my parents were told by the Khmer Rouge
p34
aVto evacuate the city because of impending American bombing for three days.
p35
aVAnd here is a picture of the Khmer Rouge.
p36
aVThey were young soldiers, typically child soldiers.
p37
aVAnd this is very normal now, of modern day conflict,
p38
aVbecause they're easy to bring into wars.
p39
aa(lp40
VThe reason that they gave about American bombing wasn't all that far off.
p41
aVI mean, from 1965 to 1973 there were
p42
aVmore munitions that fell on Cambodia
p43
aVthan in all of World War II Japan,
p44
aVincluding the two nuclear bombs
p45
aVof August 1945.
p46
aVThe Khmer Rouge didn't believe in money.
p47
aVSo the equivalent of the Federal Reserve Bank
p48
aVin Cambodia was bombed.
p49
aVBut not just that, they actually banned money.
p50
aVI think it's the only precedent in which
p51
aVmoney has ever been stopped from being used.
p52
aVAnd we know money is the root of all evil,
p53
aVbut it didn't actually stop evil from happening in Cambodia, in fact.
p54
aa(lp55
VMy family was moved from Phnom Penh to Pursat province.
p56
aVThis is a picture of what Pursat looks like.
p57
aVIt's actually a very pretty area of Cambodia,
p58
aVwhere rice growing takes place.
p59
aVAnd in fact they were forced to work the fields.
p60
aVSo my father and mother ended up in
p61
aVa sort of concentration camp, labor camp.
p62
aa(lp63
VAnd it was at that time that my mother got word
p64
aVfrom the commune chief
p65
aVthat the Vietnamese were actually asking
p66
aVfor their citizens to go back to Vietnam.
p67
aVAnd she spoke some Vietnamese,
p68
aVas a child having grown up with Vietnamese friends.
p69
aVAnd she decided, despite the advice of her neighbors,
p70
aVthat she would take the chance
p71
aVand claim to be Vietnamese
p72
aVso that we could have a chance to survive,
p73
aVbecause at this point they're forcing everybody to work.
p74
aVAnd they're giving about \u2014
p75
aVin a modern-day, caloric-restriction diet, I guess \u2014
p76
aVthey're giving porridge, with a few grains of rice.
p77
aa(lp78
VAnd at about this time actually
p79
aVmy father got very sick.
p80
aVAnd he didn't speak Vietnamese.
p81
aVSo he died actually, in January 1976.
p82
aVAnd it made it possible, in fact,
p83
aVfor us to take on this plan.
p84
aVSo the Khmer Rouge took us
p85
aVfrom a place called Pursat to Kaoh Tiev,
p86
aVwhich is across from the border from Vietnam.
p87
aVAnd there they had a detention camp
p88
aVwhere alleged Vietnamese would be tested, language tested.
p89
aa(lp90
VAnd my mother's Vietnamese was so bad
p91
aVthat to make our story more credible,
p92
aVshe'd given all the boys and girls new Vietnamese names.
p93
aVBut she'd given the boys girls' names,
p94
aVand the girls boys' names.
p95
aVAnd it wasn't until she met a Vietnamese lady
p96
aVwho told her this, and then tutored her for two days intensively,
p97
aVthat she was able to go into her exam
p98
aVand \u2014 you know, this was a moment of truth.
p99
aVIf she fails, we're all headed to the gallows;
p100
aVif she passes, we can leave to Vietnam.
p101
aVAnd she actually, of course \u2014 I'm here, she passes.
p102
aVAnd we end up in Hong Ngu on the Vietnamese side.
p103
aVAnd then onwards to Chau Doc.
p104
aVAnd this is a picture of Hong Ngu, Vietnam today.
p105
aVA pretty idyllic place on the Mekong Delta.
p106
aVBut for us it meant freedom.
p107
aVAnd freedom from persecution from the Khmer Rouge.
p108
aa(lp109
VLast year, the Khmer Rouge Tribunal,
p110
aVwhich the U.N. is helping Cambodia take on,
p111
aVstarted, and I decided that as a matter of record
p112
aVI should file a Civil Complaint
p113
aVwith the Tribunal about my father's passing away.
p114
aVAnd I got word last month
p115
aVthat the complaint was officially accepted by the Khmer Rouge Tribunal.
p116
aVAnd it's for me a matter of justice for history, and accountability for the future,
p117
aVbecause Cambodia remains a pretty lawless place, at times.
p118
aa(lp119
VFive years ago my mother and I went back to Chau Doc.
p120
aVAnd she was able to return to a place
p121
aVthat for her meant freedom, but also fear,
p122
aVbecause we had just come out of Cambodia.
p123
aVI'm happy, actually, today, to present her.
p124
aVShe's here today with us in the audience.
p125
aVThank you mother.
