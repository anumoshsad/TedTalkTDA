p9
aVWhy?
p10
aa(lp11
VA natural biological process
p12
aVthat every girl and woman goes through every month
p13
aVfor about half of her life.
p14
aVA phenomenon that is so significant
p15
aVthat the survival and propagation of our species depends on it.
p16
aVYet we consider it a taboo.
p17
aVWe feel awkward and shameful talking about it.
p18
aa(lp19
VWhen I got my first periods,
p20
aVI was told to keep it a secret from others \u2014
p21
aVeven from my father and brother.
p22
aVLater when this chapter appeared in our textbooks,
p23
aVour biology teacher skipped the subject.
p24
aa(lp25
V(Laughter)
p26
aa(lp27
VYou know what I learned from it?
p28
aVI learned that it is really shameful to talk about it.
p29
aVI learned to be ashamed of my body.
p30
aVI learned to stay unaware of periods
p31
aVin order to stay decent.
p32
aa(lp33
VResearch in various parts of India
p34
aVshows that three out of every 10 girls are not aware of menstruation
p35
aVat the time of their first periods.
p36
aVAnd in some parts of Rajasthan
p37
aVthis number is as high as nine out of 10 girls being unaware of it.
p38
aVYou'd be surprised to know
p39
aVthat most of the girls that I have spoken to,
p40
aVwho did not know about periods at the time of their first menstruation
p41
aVthought that they have got blood cancer
p42
aVand they're going to die soon.
p43
aa(lp44
VMenstrual hygiene is a very important risk factor
p45
aVfor reproductive tract infections.
p46
aVBut in India, only 12 percent of girls and women
p47
aVhave access to hygienic ways of managing their periods.
p48
aVIf you do the math,
p49
aV88 percent of girls and women use unhygienic ways to manage their periods.
p50
aa(lp51
VI was one of them.
p52
aVI grew up in a small town called Garhwa, in Jharkhand,
p53
aVwhere even buying a sanitary napkin is considered shameful.
p54
aVSo when I started getting my periods,
p55
aVI began with using rags.
p56
aVAfter every use I would wash and reuse them.
p57
aVBut to store them,
p58
aVI would hide and keep it in a dark, damp place
p59
aVso that nobody finds out that I'm menstruating.
p60
aVDue to repeated washing the rags would become coarse,
p61
aVand I would often get rashes and infections using them.
p62
aa(lp63
VI wore these already for five years until I moved out of that town.
p64
aVAnother issue that periods brought in my life
p65
aVthose of the social restrictions
p66
aVthat are imposed upon our girls and women when they're on their periods.
p67
aVI think you all must be aware of it,
p68
aVbut I'll still list it for the few who don't.
p69
aa(lp70
VI was not allowed to touch or eat pickles.
p71
aVI was not allowed to sit on the sofa or some other family member's bed.
p72
aVI had to wash my bed sheet after every period,
p73
aVeven if it was not stained.
p74
aVI was considered impure
p75
aVand forbidden from worshipping or touching any object of religious importance.
p76
aVYou'll find signposts outside temples
p77
aVdenying the entry of menstruating girls and women.
p78
aa(lp79
VIronically,
p80
aVmost of the time it is the older woman
p81
aVwho imposes such restrictions on younger girls in a family.
p82
aVAfter all, they have grown up accepting such restrictions as norms.
p83
aVAnd in the absence of any intervention,
p84
aVit is the myth and misconception
p85
aVthat propagate from generation to generation.
p86
aa(lp87
VDuring my years of work in this field,
p88
aVI have even come across stories
p89
aVwhere girls have to eat and wash their dishes separately.
p90
aVThey're not allowed to take baths during periods,
p91
aVand in some households they are even secluded from other family members.
p92
aVAbout 85 percent of girls and women in India
p93
aVwould follow one or more restrictive customs on their periods every month.
p94
aVCan you imagine what this does
p95
aVto the self-esteem and self-confidence of a young girl?
p96
aVThe psychological trauma that this inflicts,
p97
aVaffecting her personality,
p98
aVher academic performance
p99
aVand every single aspect of growing up during her early formative years?
p100
aa(lp101
VI religiously followed all these restrictive customs for 13 years,
p102
aVuntil a discussion with my partner, Tuhin,
p103
aVchanged my perception about menstruation forever.
p104
aVIn 2009, Tuhin and I were pursuing our postgraduation in design.
p105
aVWe fell in love with each other
p106
aVand I was at ease discussing periods with him.
p107
aVTuhin knew little about periods.
p108
aa(lp109
V(Laughter)
p110
aa(lp111
VHe was astonished to know that girls get painful cramps
p112
aVand we bleed every month.
p113
aa(lp114
V(Laughter)
p115
aa(lp116
VYeah.
p117
aVHe was completely shocked to know
p118
aVabout the restrictions that are imposed upon menstruating girls and women
p119
aVby their own families and their society.
p120
aVIn order to help me with my cramps,
p121
aVhe would go on the Internet and learn more about menstruation.
p122
aVWhen he shared his findings with me,
p123
aVI realized how little I knew about menstruation myself.
p124
aVAnd many of my beliefs actually turned out to be myths.
p125
aa(lp126
VThat's when we wondered:
p127
aVif we, being so well educated,
p128
aVwere so ill-informed about menstruation,
p129
aVthere would be millions of girls out there who would be ill-informed, too.
p130
aVTo study \u2014
p131
aVto understand the problem better,
p132
aVI undertook a year-long research to study the lack of awareness about menstruation
p133
aVand the root cause behind it.
p134
aa(lp135
VWhile it is generally believed
p136
aVthat menstrual unawareness and misconception is a rural phenomenon,
p137
aVduring my research,
p138
aVI found that it is as much an urban phenomenon as well.
p139
aVAnd it exists with the educated urban class, also.
p140
aVWhile talking to many parents and teachers,
p141
aVI found that many of them actually wanted to educate girls about periods
p142
aVbefore they have started getting their menstrual cycle.
p143
aVAnd \u2014
p144
aVbut they lacked the proper means themselves.
p145
aVAnd since it is a taboo,
p146
aVthey feel inhibition and shameful in talking about it.
p147
aa(lp148
VGirls nowadays get their periods in classes six and seven,
p149
aVbut our educational curriculum
p150
aVteaches girls about periods only in standard eight and nine.
p151
aVAnd since it is a taboo,
p152
aVteachers still skip the subject altogether.
p153
aa(lp154
VSo school does not teach girls about periods,
p155
aVparents don't talk about it.
p156
aVWhere do the girls go?
p157
aVTwo decades ago and now \u2014
p158
aVnothing has changed.
p159
aVI shared these finding with Tuhin and we wondered:
p160
aVWhat if we could create something
p161
aVthat would help girls understand about menstruation on their own \u2014
p162
aVsomething that would help parents and teachers
p163
aVtalk about periods comfortably to young girls?
p164
aa(lp165
VDuring my research,
p166
aVI was collecting a lot of stories.
p167
aVThese were stories of experiences of girls during their periods.
p168
aVThese stories would make girls curious and interested
p169
aVin talking about menstruation in their close circle.
p170
aVThat's what we wanted.
p171
aVWe wanted something that would make the girls curious
p172
aVand drive them to learn about it.
p173
aVWe wanted to use these stories to teach girls about periods.
p174
aa(lp175
VSo we decided to create a comic book,
p176
aVwhere the cartoon characters would enact these stories
p177
aVand educate girls about menstruation in a fun and engaging way.
p178
aVTo represent girls in their different phases of puberty,
p179
aVwe have three characters.
p180
aVPinki, who has not gotten her period yet,
p181
aVJiya who gets her period during the narrative of the book
p182
aVand Mira who has already been getting her period.
p183
aVThere is a fourth character, Priya Didi.
p184
aVThrough her, girls come to know about the various aspects of growing up
p185
aVand menstrual hygiene management.
p186
aa(lp187
VWhile making the book, we took great care
p188
aVthat none of the illustrations were objectionable in any way
p189
aVand that it is culturally sensitive.
p190
aVDuring our prototype testing, we found that the girls loved the book.
p191
aVThey were keen on reading it
p192
aVand knowing more and more about periods on their own.
p193
aVParents and teachers were comfortable in talking about periods
p194
aVto young girls using the book,
p195
aVand sometimes even boys were interested in reading it.
p196
aa(lp197
V(Laughter)
p198
aa(lp199
V(Applause)
p200
aa(lp201
VThe comic book helped in creating an environment
p202
aVwhere menstruation ceased to be a taboo.
p203
aVMany of the volunteers took this prototype themselves to educate girls
p204
aVand take menstrual awareness workshops in five different states in India.
p205
aVAnd one of the volunteers took this prototype to educate young monks
p206
aVand took it to this monastery in Ladakh.
p207
aa(lp208
VWe made the final version of the book, called "Menstrupedia Comic"
p209
aVand launched in September last year.
p210
aVAnd so far,
p211
aVmore than 4,000 girls have been educated by using the book in India and \u2014
p212
aa(lp213
V(Applause)
p214
aa(lp215
VThank you.
p216
aa(lp217
V(Applause)
p218
aa(lp219
VAnd 10 different countries.
p220
aVWe are constantly translating the book into different languages
p221
aVand collaborating with local organizations
p222
aVto make this book available in different countries.
p223
aa(lp224
V15 schools in different parts of India
p225
aVhave made this book a part of their school curriculum
p226
aVto teach girls about menstruation.
p227
aa(lp228
V(Applause)
p229
aa(lp230
VI am amazed to see how volunteers,
p231
aVindividuals, parents, teachers, school principals,
p232
aVhave come together
p233
aVand taken this menstrual awareness drive to their own communities,
p234
aVhave made sure that the girls learn about periods at the right age
p235
aVand helped in breaking this taboo.
p236
aa(lp237
VI dream of a future where menstruation is not a curse,
p238
aVnot a disease,
p239
aVbut a welcoming change in a girl's life.
p240
aVAnd I would \u2014
p241
aa(lp242
V(Applause)
p243
aa(lp244
VAnd I would like to end this
p245
aVwith a small request to all the parents here.
p246
aa(lp247
VDear parents,
p248
aVif you would be ashamed of periods,
p249
aVyour daughters would be, too.
p250
aVSo please be period positive.
p251
aa(lp252
V(Laughter)
p253
aa(lp254
VThank you.
