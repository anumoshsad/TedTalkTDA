VHow many people here have heard of PMS?
p4
aVEverybody, right?
p5
aVEveryone knows that women go a little crazy
p6
aVright before they get their period,
p7
aVthat the menstrual cycle throws them onto an inevitable hormonal roller coaster
p8
aVof irrationality and irritability.
p9
aVThere's a general assumption
p10
aVthat fluctuations in reproductive hormones cause extreme emotions
p11
aVand that the great majority of women are affected by this.
p12
aVWell, I am here to tell you that scientific evidence says
p13
aVneither of those assumptions is true.
p14
aVI'm here to give you  the good news about PMS.
p15
aa(lp16
VBut first, let's take a look at how firmly the idea of PMS
p17
aVis entrenched in American culture.
p18
aVIf you examine newspaper or magazine articles,
p19
aVyou'll see how widely assumed it is that everyone gets PMS.
p20
aVIn an article in the magazine Redbook titled "You: PMS Free,"
p21
aVreaders were informed that between 80  to 90 percent of women suffer from PMS.
p22
aVL.A. Muscle magazine warned its readers
p23
aVthat 40 to 50 percent of women suffer from PMS,
p24
aVand that it plays a major role in women's mental and physical health,
p25
aVand a couple of years ago, even the Wall Street Journal
p26
aVran an article on calcium as a treatment for PMS,
p27
aVasking its female readers,
p28
aV"Do you turn into a witch every month?"
p29
aa(lp30
VFrom all these articles, you would think there must be a mountain of research
p31
aVverifying the widespread nature of PMS.
p32
aVHowever, after five decades of research,
p33
aVthere's no strong consensus on the definition, the cause,
p34
aVthe treatment, or even  the existence of PMS.
p35
aVAs most commonly defined by psychologists,
p36
aVPMS involves negative behavioral, cognitive and physical symptoms
p37
aVfrom the time of ovulation to menstruation.
p38
aVBut here's where it gets tricky.
p39
aVOver 150 different symptoms have been used to diagnose PMS,
p40
aVand here are just a few of those.
p41
aa(lp42
VNow, I want to be clear here.
p43
aVI'm not saying women don't get some of these symptoms.
p44
aVWhat I'm saying is that getting some of these symptoms
p45
aVdoesn't amount to a mental disorder,
p46
aVand when psychologists come up with a disorder
p47
aVthat's so vaguely defined,
p48
aVthe label eventually becomes meaningless.
p49
aVWith a list of symptoms this long and wide,
p50
aVI could have PMS, you could have PMS,
p51
aVthe guy in the third row here could have PMS,
p52
aVmy dog could have PMS. (Laughter)
p53
aVSome researchers said you had to have five symptoms.
p54
aVSome said three.
p55
aVOther researchers said that symptoms were only meaningful
p56
aVif they were highly disturbing to you,
p57
aVbut others said minor symptoms were just as important.
p58
aVFor many years, because there was no standardization
p59
aVin the definition of PMS,
p60
aVwhen psychologists tried to report prevalence rates,
p61
aVtheir estimates ranged from five percent of women
p62
aVto 97 percent of women,
p63
aVso at the same time almost no one and almost everyone had PMS.
p64
aa(lp65
VOverall, the weaknesses in the methods of research on PMS have been considerable.
p66
aVFirst, many studies asked women to report their symptoms retrospectively,
p67
aVlooking to the past and relying on memory,
p68
aVwhich is known to inflate reporting of PMS
p69
aVcompared to what's called prospective reporting,
p70
aVwhich involves keeping a daily log of symptoms
p71
aVfor at least two months in a row.
p72
aVMany studies also exclusively focused on white, middle-class women,
p73
aVwhich makes it problematic to apply study findings to all women.
p74
aVWe know there's a strong cultural component to the belief in PMS
p75
aVbecause it's nearly unheard of outside of Western nations.
p76
aVThird, many studies failed to use control groups.
p77
aVIf we want to understand the specific characteristics
p78
aVof women who have PMS,
p79
aVwe need to be able to compare them to women who don't have PMS.
p80
aVAnd finally, many different types of questionnaires were used
p81
aVto diagnose PMS, focusing on different symptoms,
p82
aVsymptom duration and severity.
p83
aVTo do reliable research on any condition,
p84
aVscientists must agree on the specific characteristics
p85
aVthat make up that condition
p86
aVso they're all talking about the same thing,
p87
aVand with PMS, this has not been the case.
p88
aa(lp89
VHowever, in 1994,
p90
aVthe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
p91
aVknown as the DSM, thankfully \u2014
p92
aVit's also the manual for mental health professionals \u2014
p93
aVthey redefined PMS as PMDD,
p94
aVPremenstrual Dysphoric Disorder.
p95
aVAnd dysphoria refers to a feeling of agitation or unease.
p96
aVAnd according to these new DSM guidelines,
p97
aVin most menstrual cycles in the last year,
p98
aVat least five of 11 possible symptoms
p99
aVmust appear in the week before menstruation starts;
p100
aVthe symptoms must improve once menstruation has begun;
p101
aVand the symptoms must be absent the week after menstruation has ended.
p102
aVOne of these symptoms must come from this list of four:
p103
aVmarked mood swings, irritability, anxiety, or depression.
p104
aVThe other symptoms could come from the first slide
p105
aVor from those on the second slide,
p106
aVincluding symptoms like feeling out of control
p107
aVand changes in sleep or appetite.
p108
aVThe DSM also required now that the symptoms
p109
aVshould be associated with clinically significant distress \u2014
p110
aVthere should be some kind of disturbance in work
p111
aVor school or social relationships \u2014
p112
aVand that symptoms and symptom severity should now be documented
p113
aVby keeping a daily log for at least two cycles in a row.
p114
aVAnd finally, the DSM required that the emotional disturbance
p115
aVshould be more than simply an exacerbation of an already existing disorder.
p116
aVSo scientifically speaking, this is an improvement.
p117
aVWe now have a limited number of symptoms,
p118
aVand a high impact on functioning that's required,
p119
aVand the reporting and timing of symptoms have both become very specific.
p120
aVWell, using this criteria
p121
aVand looking at most recent studies,
p122
aVwe see that on average,
p123
aVthree to eight percent of women suffer from PMDD.
p124
aVNot all women, not most women,
p125
aVnot the majority of women, not even a lot of women:
p126
aVthree to eight percent.
p127
aVFor everyone else, variables like stressful events or happy occasions
p128
aVor even day of the week
p129
aVare more powerful predictors of mood than time of the month,
p130
aVand this is the information the scientific community has had
p131
aVsince the 1990s.
p132
aVIn 2002, my colleagues and I published an article
p133
aVdescribing the PMS and PMDD research,
p134
aVand several similar articles have appeared in psychology journals.
p135
aVThe questions is, why hasn't this information trickled down to the public?
p136
aVWhy do these myths persist?
p137
aa(lp138
VWell, certainly the onslaught of messages that women receive
p139
aVfrom books, TV, movies, the Internet, that everyone gets PMS
p140
aVgo a long way in convincing them it must be true.
p141
aVResearch tells us that the more a woman believes that everyone gets PMS,
p142
aVthe more likely she is to erroneously report that she has it.
p143
aVLet me tell you what I mean by "erroneously."
p144
aVYou might ask her, "Do you have PMS?"
p145
aVand she says yes,
p146
aVbut then, when you have her  keep a daily log
p147
aVof psychological symptoms for two months,
p148
aVno correlation is found between her symptoms
p149
aVand time of the month.
p150
aa(lp151
VAnother reason for the persistence of the PMS myth
p152
aVhas to do with the narrow boundaries of the feminine role.
p153
aVFeminist psychologists like Joan Chrisler
p154
aVhave suggested that taking on the label of PMS
p155
aVallows women to express emotions that would otherwise be considered unladylike.
p156
aVThe near universal definition of a good woman
p157
aVis one who is happy, loving, caring for others,
p158
aVand taking great satisfaction from that role.
p159
aVWell, PMS has become a permission slip to be angry, complain, be irritated,
p160
aVwithout losing the title of good woman.
p161
aVWe know that the variables in a woman's environment
p162
aVare much more likely to cause her to be angry than her hormones,
p163
aVbut when she attributes anger to hormones,
p164
aVshe's absolved of responsibility or criticism.
p165
aV"Oh, that's not who she is. It's out of her control."
p166
aVAnd while this can be a useful tool, it serves to invalidate women's emotions.
p167
aVWhen people respond to a woman's anger
p168
aVwith the thought, "Oh, it's just that time of the month,"
p169
aVher ability to be taken seriously or effect change is severely limited.
p170
aa(lp171
VSo who else benefits from the myth of PMS?
p172
aVWell, I can tell you that treating PMS
p173
aVhas become a profitable,  thriving industry.
p174
aVAmazon.com currently offers over 1,900 books on PMS treatment.
p175
aVA quick Google search will bring up a cornucopia
p176
aVof clinics, workshops and seminars.
p177
aVReputable Internet sources of medical information
p178
aVlike WebMD or the Mayo Clinic list PMS as a known disorder.
p179
aVIt's not a known disorder, but they list it.
p180
aVAnd they also list the medications that physicians have prescribed to treat it,
p181
aVlike anti-depressants or hormones.
p182
aVInterestingly, though, both websites say that the success of medication
p183
aVin treating PMS symptoms vary from woman to woman.
p184
aVWell, that doesn't make sense.
p185
aVIf you've got a distinct disorder with a distinct cause,
p186
aVwhich PMS is supposed to be,
p187
aVthen the treatment should bring improvement for a great number of women.
p188
aVThis has not been the case with these treatments,
p189
aVand FDA regulations say that for a drug to be deemed effective,
p190
aVa large portion of the target population
p191
aVshould see clinically significant improvement.
p192
aVSo we have not had that at all with these so-called treatments.
p193
aVHowever, the financial gain of perpetuating the myth
p194
aVthat PMS is a common mental disorder
p195
aVand is treatable is quite substantial.
p196
aVWhen women are prescribed drugs like anti-depressants or hormones,
p197
aVmedical protocol requires that they have physician follow-up every three months.
p198
aVThat's a lot of doctor visits.
p199
aVPharmaceutical companies reap untold profits
p200
aVwhen women are convinced they should take a prescribed medication
p201
aVfor all of their child-bearing lives.
p202
aVOver-the-counter drugs like Midol
p203
aVeven claim to treat PMS symptoms like tension and irritability,
p204
aVeven though they only contain a diuretic, a pain reliever
p205
aVand caffeine.
p206
aVNow, far be it from me to argue with the magical powers of caffeine,
p207
aVbut I don't think reducing tension is one of them.
p208
aVSince 2002, Midol has marketed a Teen Midol to adolescents.
p209
aVThey are aiming at young girls early,
p210
aVto convince them that everyone gets PMS and that it will make you a monster,
p211
aVbut wait, there's something you can do about it:
p212
aVTake Midol and you will be a human being again.
p213
aVIn 2013, Midol took in 48 million dollars in sales revenue.
p214
aa(lp215
VSo while perpetuating the myth of PMS has been lucrative for some,
p216
aVit comes with some serious adverse consequences for women.
p217
aVFirst, it contributes to the medicalization
p218
aVof women's reproductive health.
p219
aVThe medical field has a long history of conceptualizing
p220
aVwomen's reproductive processes as illnesses that require treatment,
p221
aVand this has come at many costs, including excessive Cesarean deliveries,
p222
aVhysterectomies and prescribed hormone treatments
p223
aVthat have harmed rather than enhanced women's health.
p224
aVSecond, the PMS myth also contributes to the stereotype of women
p225
aVas irrational and overemotional.
p226
aVWhen the menstrual cycle is described as a hormonal roller coaster
p227
aVthat turns women into angry beasts,
p228
aVit becomes easy to question  the competence of all women.
p229
aVWomen have made tremendous strides in the workforce,
p230
aVbut still there's a minuscule number of women at the highest echelons
p231
aVof fields like government or business,
p232
aVand when we think about who makes for a good CEO or senator,
p233
aVsomeone who has qualities like  rationality, steadiness, competence
p234
aVcome to mind,
p235
aVand in our culture, that sounds more like a man than a woman,
p236
aVand the PMS myth contributes to that.
p237
aa(lp238
VPsychologists know that the moods of men and women
p239
aVare more similar than different.
p240
aVOne study followed men and women for four to six months
p241
aVand found that the number of mood swings they experienced
p242
aVand the severity of those mood swings were no different.
p243
aVAnd finally, the PMS myth keeps women from dealing
p244
aVwith the actual issues causing them emotional upset.
p245
aVIndividual issues like quality of relationship or work conditions
p246
aVor societal issues like racism or sexism or the daily grind of poverty
p247
aVare all strongly related to daily mood.
p248
aVSweeping emotions under the rug of PMS
p249
aVkeeps women from understanding the source of their negative emotions,
p250
aVbut it also takes away the opportunity to take any action to change them.
p251
aa(lp252
VSo the good news about PMS
p253
aVis that while some women get some symptoms because of the menstrual cycle,
p254
aVthe great majority don't get a mental disorder.
p255
aVThey go to work or school, take care of their families,
p256
aVand function at a normal level.
p257
aVWe know the emotions and moods of men and women
p258
aVare more similar than different,
p259
aVso let's walk away from the tired old PMS myth of women as witches
p260
aVand embrace the reality of high emotional and professional functioning
p261
aVthe great majority of women live every day.
