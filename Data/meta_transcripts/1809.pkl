VHi. I am an architect.
p4
aVI am the only architect in the world
p5
aVmaking buildings out of paper like this cardboard tube,
p6
aVand this exhibition is the first one I did
p7
aVusing paper tubes.
p8
aV1986, much, much longer before people started talking
p9
aVabout ecological issues and environmental issues,
p10
aVI just started testing the paper tube
p11
aVin order to use this as a building structure.
p12
aVIt's very complicated to test the new material for the building,
p13
aVbut this is much stronger than I expected,
p14
aVand also it's very easy to waterproof,
p15
aVand also, because it's industrial material,
p16
aVit's also possible to fireproof.
p17
aa(lp18
VThen I built the temporary structure, 1990.
p19
aVThis is the first temporary building made out of paper.
p20
aVThere are 330 tubes, diameter 55 [centimeters],
p21
aVthere are only 12 tubes with a diameter
p22
aVof 120 centimeters, or four feet, wide.
p23
aVAs you see it in the photo, inside is the toilet.
p24
aVIn case you're finished with toilet paper,
p25
aVyou can tear off the inside of the wall. (Laughter)
p26
aVSo it's very useful.
p27
aa(lp28
VYear 2000, there was a big expo in Germany.
p29
aVI was asked to design the building,
p30
aVbecause the theme of the expo was environmental issues.
p31
aVSo I was chosen to build the pavilion out of paper tubes,
p32
aVrecyclable paper.
p33
aVMy goal of the design is not when it's completed.
p34
aVMy goal was when the building was demolished,
p35
aVbecause each country makes a lot of pavilions
p36
aVbut after half a year, we create a lot of industrial waste,
p37
aVso my building has to be reused or recycled.
p38
aVAfter, the building was recycled.
p39
aVSo that was the goal of my design.
p40
aa(lp41
VThen I was very lucky to win the competition
p42
aVto build the second Pompidou Center in France
p43
aVin the city of Metz.
p44
aVBecause I was so poor,
p45
aVI wanted to rent an office in Paris,
p46
aVbut I couldn't afford it,
p47
aVso I decided to bring my students to Paris
p48
aVto build our office on top of the Pompidou Center in Paris
p49
aVby ourselves.
p50
aVSo we brought the paper tubes and the wooden joints
p51
aVto complete the 35-meter-long office.
p52
aVWe stayed there for six years without paying any rent.
p53
aa(lp54
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p55
aa(lp56
VThank you. I had one big problem.
p57
aVBecause we were part of the exhibition,
p58
aVeven if my friend wanted to see me, they had to buy a ticket to see me.
p59
aVThat was the problem.
p60
aa(lp61
VThen I completed the Pompidou Center in Metz.
p62
aVIt's a very popular museum now,
p63
aVand I created a big monument for the government.
p64
aa(lp65
VBut then I was very disappointed
p66
aVat my profession as an architect,
p67
aVbecause we are not helping, we are not working for society,
p68
aVbut we are working for privileged people,
p69
aVrich people, government, developers.
p70
aVThey have money and power.
p71
aVThose are invisible.
p72
aVSo they hire us to visualize their power and money
p73
aVby making monumental architecture.
p74
aVThat is our profession, even historically it's the same,
p75
aVeven now we are doing the same.
p76
aVSo I was very disappointed that we are not working for society,
p77
aVeven though there are so many people
p78
aVwho lost their houses by natural disasters.
p79
aVBut I must say they are no longer natural disasters.
p80
aVFor example, earthquakes never kill people,
p81
aVbut collapse of the buildings kill people.
p82
aVThat's the responsibility of architects.
p83
aVThen people need some temporary housing,
p84
aVbut there are no architects working there
p85
aVbecause we are too busy working for privileged people.
p86
aVSo I thought, even as architects,
p87
aVwe can be involved in the reconstruction of temporary housing.
p88
aVWe can make it better.
p89
aVSo that is why I started working in disaster areas.
p90
aa(lp91
V1994, there was a big disaster in Rwanda, Africa.
p92
aVTwo tribes, Hutu and Tutsi, fought each other.
p93
aVOver two million people became refugees.
p94
aVBut I was so surprised to see the shelter, refugee camp
p95
aVorganized by the U.N.
p96
aVThey're so poor, and they are freezing
p97
aVwith blankets during the rainy season,
p98
aVIn the shelters built by the U.N.,
p99
aVthey were just providing a plastic sheet,
p100
aVand the refugees had to cut the trees, and just like this.
p101
aVBut over two million people cut trees.
p102
aVIt just became big, heavy deforestation
p103
aVand an environmental problem.
p104
aVThat is why they started providing aluminum pipes, aluminum barracks.
p105
aVVery expensive, they throw them out for money,
p106
aVthen cutting trees again.
p107
aVSo I proposed my idea to improve the situation
p108
aVusing these recycled paper tubes
p109
aVbecause this is so cheap and also so strong,
p110
aVbut my budget is only 50 U.S. dollars per unit.
p111
aVWe built 50 units to do that as a monitoring test
p112
aVfor the durability and moisture and termites, so on.
p113
aa(lp114
VAnd then, year afterward, 1995, in Kobe, Japan,
p115
aVwe had a big earthquake.
p116
aVNearly 7,000 people were killed,
p117
aVand the city like this Nagata district,
p118
aVall the city was burned in a fire after the earthquake.
p119
aVAnd also I found out there's many Vietnamese refugees
p120
aVsuffering and gathering at a Catholic church \u2014
p121
aVall the building was totally destroyed.
p122
aa(lp123
VSo I went there and also I proposed to the priests,
p124
aV"Why don't we rebuild the church out of paper tubes?"
p125
aa(lp126
VAnd he said, "Oh God, are you crazy?
p127
aVAfter a fire, what are you proposing?"
p128
aa(lp129
VSo he never trusted me, but I didn't give up.
p130
aVI started commuting to Kobe,
p131
aVand I met the society of Vietnamese people.
p132
aVThey were living like this with very poor plastic sheets
p133
aVin the park.
p134
aVSo I proposed to rebuild. I raised \u2014 did fundraising.
p135
aVI made a paper tube shelter for them,
p136
aVand in order to make it easy to be built by students
p137
aVand also easy to demolish,
p138
aVI used beer crates as a foundation.
p139
aVI asked the Kirin beer company to propose,
p140
aVbecause at that time, the Asahi beer company
p141
aVmade their plastic beer crates red,
p142
aVwhich doesn't go with the color of the paper tubes.
p143
aVThe color coordination is very important.
p144
aVAnd also I still remember, we were expecting
p145
aVto have a beer inside the plastic beer crate,
p146
aVbut it came empty. (Laughter)
p147
aVSo I remember it was so disappointing.
p148
aVSo during the summer with my students,
p149
aVwe built over 50 units of the shelters.
p150
aa(lp151
VFinally the priest, finally he trusted me to rebuild.
p152
aVHe said, "As long as you collect money by yourself,
p153
aVbring your students to build, you can do it."
p154
aa(lp155
VSo we spent five weeks rebuilding the church.
p156
aVIt was meant to stay there for three years,
p157
aVbut actually it stayed there 10 years because people loved it.
p158
aVThen, in Taiwan, they had a big earthquake,
p159
aVand we proposed to donate this church,
p160
aVso we dismantled them,
p161
aVwe sent them over to be built by volunteer people.
p162
aVIt stayed there in Taiwan as a permanent church even now.
p163
aVSo this building became a permanent building.
p164
aa(lp165
VThen I wonder, what is a permanent and what is a temporary building?
p166
aVEven a building made in paper
p167
aVcan be permanent as long as people love it.
p168
aVEven a concrete building can be very temporary
p169
aVif that is made to make money.
p170
aa(lp171
VIn 1999, in Turkey, the big earthquake,
p172
aVI went there to use the local material to build a shelter.
p173
aV2001, in West India, I built also a shelter.
p174
aVIn 2004, in Sri Lanka, after the Sumatra earthquake
p175
aVand tsunami, I rebuilt Islamic fishermen's villages.
p176
aa(lp177
VAnd in 2008, in Chengdu, Sichuan area in China,
p178
aVnearly 70,000 people were killed,
p179
aVand also especially many of the schools were destroyed
p180
aVbecause of the corruption between the authority and the contractor.
p181
aVI was asked to rebuild the temporary church.
p182
aVI brought my Japanese students to work with the Chinese students.
p183
aVIn one month, we completed nine classrooms,
p184
aVover 500 square meters.
p185
aVIt's still used, even after the current earthquake in China.
p186
aa(lp187
VIn 2009, in Italy, L'Aquila, also they had a big earthquake.
p188
aVAnd this is a very interesting photo:
p189
aVformer Prime Minister Berlusconi
p190
aVand Japanese former former former former Prime Minister Mr. Aso \u2014
p191
aVyou know, because we have to change the prime minister ever year.
p192
aVAnd they are very kind, affording my model.
p193
aVI proposed a big rebuilding, a temporary music hall,
p194
aVbecause L'Aquila is very famous for music
p195
aVand all the concert halls were destroyed,
p196
aVso musicians were moving out.
p197
aa(lp198
VSo I proposed to the mayor,
p199
aVI'd like to rebuild the temporary auditorium.
p200
aVHe said, "As long as you bring your money, you can do it."
p201
aVAnd I was very lucky.
p202
aVMr. Berlusconi brought G8 summit,
p203
aVand our former prime minister came,
p204
aVso they helped us to collect money,
p205
aVand I got half a million euros from the Japanese government
p206
aVto rebuild this temporary auditorium.
p207
aa(lp208
VYear 2010 in Haiti, there was a big earthquake,
p209
aVbut it's impossible to fly over,
p210
aVso I went to Santo Domingo, next-door country,
p211
aVto drive six hours to get to Haiti
p212
aVwith the local students in Santo Domingo
p213
aVto build 50 units of shelter out of local paper tubes.
p214
aa(lp215
VThis is what happened in Japan two years ago, in northern Japan.
p216
aVAfter the earthquake and tsunami,
p217
aVpeople had to be evacuated in a big room like a gymnasium.
p218
aVBut look at this. There's no privacy.
p219
aVPeople suffer mentally and physically.
p220
aVSo we went there to build partitions
p221
aVwith all the student volunteers with paper tubes,
p222
aVjust a very simple shelter out of the tube frame and the curtain.
p223
aVHowever, some of the facility authority
p224
aVdoesn't want us to do it, because, they said,
p225
aVsimply, it's become more difficult to control them.
p226
aVBut it's really necessary to do it.
p227
aa(lp228
VThey don't have enough flat area to build
p229
aVstandard government single-story housing like this one.
p230
aVLook at this. Even civil government is doing
p231
aVsuch poor construction of the temporary housing,
p232
aVso dense and so messy because there is no storage, nothing, water is leaking,
p233
aVso I thought, we have to make multi-story building
p234
aVbecause there's no land and also it's not very comfortable.
p235
aa(lp236
VSo I proposed to the mayor while I was making partitions.
p237
aVFinally I met a very nice mayor in Onagawa village
p238
aVin Miyagi.
p239
aVHe asked me to build three-story housing on baseball [fields].
p240
aVI used the shipping container
p241
aVand also the students helped us to make
p242
aVall the building furniture
p243
aVto make them comfortable,
p244
aVwithin the budget of the government
p245
aVbut also the area of the house is exactly the same,
p246
aVbut much more comfortable.
p247
aVMany of the people want to stay here forever.
p248
aVI was very happy to hear that.
p249
aa(lp250
VNow I am working in New Zealand, Christchurch.
p251
aVAbout 20 days before the Japanese earthquake happened,
p252
aValso they had a big earthquake,
p253
aVand many Japanese students were also killed,
p254
aVand the most important cathedral of the city,
p255
aVthe symbol of Christchurch, was totally destroyed.
p256
aVAnd I was asked to come to rebuild the temporary cathedral.
p257
aa(lp258
VSo this is under construction.
p259
aVAnd I'd like to keep building monuments
p260
aVthat are beloved by people.
p261
aa(lp262
VThank you very much.
p263
aa(lp264
V(Applause)
p265
aa(lp266
VThank you. (Applause)
p267
aa(lp268
VThank you very much. (Applause)
