VWhen I was in my 20s,
p4
aVI saw my very first psychotherapy client.
p5
aVI was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology at Berkeley.
p6
aVShe was a 26-year-old woman named Alex.
p7
aa(lp8
VNow Alex walked into her first session wearing jeans and a big slouchy top,
p9
aVand she dropped onto the couch in my office
p10
aVand kicked off her flats
p11
aVand told me she was there to talk about guy problems.
p12
aVNow when I heard this, I was so relieved.
p13
aVMy classmate got an arsonist for her first client.
p14
aa(lp15
V(Laughter)
p16
aa(lp17
VAnd I got a twentysomething who wanted to talk about boys.
p18
aVThis I thought I could handle.
p19
aVBut I didn't handle it.
p20
aVWith the funny stories that Alex would bring to session,
p21
aVit was easy for me just to nod my head
p22
aVwhile we kicked the can down the road.
p23
aV"Thirty's the new 20," Alex would say,
p24
aVand as far as I could tell, she was right.
p25
aVWork happened later, marriage happened later,
p26
aVkids happened later, even death happened later.
p27
aVTwentysomethings like Alex and I had nothing but time.
p28
aa(lp29
VBut before long, my supervisor pushed me to push Alex about her love life.
p30
aVI pushed back.
p31
aVI said, "Sure, she's dating down,
p32
aVshe's sleeping with a knucklehead,
p33
aVbut it's not like she's going to marry the guy."
p34
aVAnd then my supervisor said,
p35
aV"Not yet, but she might marry the next one.
p36
aVBesides, the best time to work on Alex's marriage
p37
aVis before she has one."
p38
aa(lp39
VThat's what psychologists call an "Aha!" moment.
p40
aVThat was the moment I realized, 30 is not the new 20.
p41
aVYes, people settle down later than they used to,
p42
aVbut that didn't make Alex's 20s a developmental downtime.
p43
aVThat made Alex's 20s a developmental sweet spot,
p44
aVand we were sitting there, blowing it.
p45
aVThat was when I realized that this sort of benign neglect
p46
aVwas a real problem, and it had real consequences,
p47
aVnot just for Alex and her love life
p48
aVbut for the careers and the families and the futures
p49
aVof twentysomethings everywhere.
p50
aa(lp51
VThere are 50 million twentysomethings in the United States right now.
p52
aVWe're talking about 15 percent of the population,
p53
aVor 100 percent if you consider
p54
aVthat no one's getting through adulthood without going through their 20s first.
p55
aa(lp56
V(Laughter)
p57
aa(lp58
VRaise your hand if you're in your 20s.
p59
aVI really want to see some twentysomethings here.
p60
aVOh, yay! You are all awesome.
p61
aVIf you work with twentysomethings, you love a twentysomething,
p62
aVyou're losing sleep over twentysomethings, I want to see \u2014
p63
aVOkay. Awesome, twentysomethings really matter.
p64
aa(lp65
VSo, I specialize in twentysomethings because I believe
p66
aVthat every single one of those 50 million twentysomethings
p67
aVdeserves to know what psychologists,
p68
aVsociologists, neurologists and fertility specialists
p69
aValready know:
p70
aVthat claiming your 20s is one of the simplest,
p71
aVyet most transformative, things you can do
p72
aVfor work, for love, for your happiness,
p73
aVmaybe even for the world.
p74
aa(lp75
VThis is not my opinion.
p76
aVThese are the facts.
p77
aVWe know that 80 percent of life's most defining moments
p78
aVtake place by age 35.
p79
aVThat means that eight out of 10
p80
aVof the decisions and experiences and "Aha!" moments
p81
aVthat make your life what it is
p82
aVwill have happened by your mid-30s.
p83
aVPeople who are over 40, don't panic.
p84
aVThis crowd is going to be fine, I think.
p85
aVWe know that the first 10 years of a career
p86
aVhas an exponential impact on how much money you're going to earn.
p87
aVWe know that more than half of Americans
p88
aVare married or are living with or dating their future partner by 30.
p89
aVWe know that the brain caps off
p90
aVits second and last growth spurt in your 20s
p91
aVas it rewires itself for adulthood,
p92
aVwhich means that whatever it is you want to change about yourself,
p93
aVnow is the time to change it.
p94
aVWe know that personality changes more during your 20s
p95
aVthan at any other time in life,
p96
aVand we know that female fertility peaks at age 28,
p97
aVand things get tricky after age 35.
p98
aVSo your 20s are the time to educate yourself
p99
aVabout your body and your options.
p100
aa(lp101
VSo when we think about child development,
p102
aVwe all know that the first five years are a critical period
p103
aVfor language and attachment in the brain.
p104
aVIt's a time when your ordinary, day-to-day life
p105
aVhas an inordinate impact on who you will become.
p106
aVBut what we hear less about is that there's such a thing
p107
aVas adult development,
p108
aVand our 20s are that critical period of adult development.
p109
aa(lp110
VBut this isn't what twentysomethings are hearing.
p111
aVNewspapers talk about the changing timetable of adulthood.
p112
aVResearchers call the 20s an extended adolescence.
p113
aVJournalists coin silly nicknames for twentysomethings
p114
aVlike "twixters" and "kidults."
p115
aa(lp116
V(Laughing) It's true!
p117
aa(lp118
VAs a culture, we have trivialized
p119
aVwhat is actually the defining decade of adulthood.
p120
aa(lp121
VLeonard Bernstein said that to achieve great things,
p122
aVyou need a plan and not quite enough time.
p123
aa(lp124
V(Laughing) Isn't that true?
p125
aa(lp126
VSo what do you think happens
p127
aVwhen you pat a twentysomething on the head and you say,
p128
aV"You have 10 extra years to start your life"?
p129
aVNothing happens.
p130
aVYou have robbed that person of his urgency and ambition,
p131
aVand absolutely nothing happens.
p132
aa(lp133
VAnd then every day, smart, interesting twentysomethings
p134
aVlike you or like your sons and daughters
p135
aVcome into my office and say things like this:
p136
aV"I know my boyfriend's no good for me,
p137
aVbut this relationship doesn't count. I'm just killing time."
p138
aVOr they say, "Everybody says as long as I get started
p139
aVon a career by the time I'm 30, I'll be fine."
p140
aa(lp141
VBut then it starts to sound like this:
p142
aV"My 20s are almost over, and I have nothing to show for myself.
p143
aVI had a better résumé the day after I graduated from college."
p144
aVAnd then it starts to sound like this:
p145
aV"Dating in my 20s was like musical chairs.
p146
aVEverybody was running around and having fun,
p147
aVbut then sometime around 30 it was like the music turned off
p148
aVand everybody started sitting down.
p149
aVI didn't want to be the only one left standing up,
p150
aVso sometimes I think I married my husband
p151
aVbecause he was the closest chair to me at 30."
p152
aa(lp153
VWhere are the twentysomethings here?
p154
aVDo not do that.
p155
aa(lp156
V(Laughter)
p157
aa(lp158
VOkay, now that sounds a little flip, but make no mistake,
p159
aVthe stakes are very high.
p160
aVWhen a lot has been pushed to your 30s,
p161
aVthere is enormous thirtysomething pressure
p162
aVto jump-start a career, pick a city, partner up,
p163
aVand have two or three kids in a much shorter period of time.
p164
aVMany of these things are incompatible,
p165
aVand as research is just starting to show,
p166
aVsimply harder and more stressful to do all at once in our 30s.
p167
aa(lp168
VThe post-millennial midlife crisis isn't buying a red sports car.
p169
aVIt's realizing you can't have that career you now want.
p170
aVIt's realizing you can't have that child you now want,
p171
aVor you can't give your child a sibling.
p172
aVToo many thirtysomethings and fortysomethings
p173
aVlook at themselves, and at me, sitting across the room,
p174
aVand say about their 20s,
p175
aV"What was I doing? What was I thinking?"
p176
aVI want to change what twentysomethings are doing and thinking.
p177
aa(lp178
VHere's a story about how that can go.
p179
aVIt's a story about a woman named Emma.
p180
aVAt 25, Emma came to my office
p181
aVbecause she was, in her words, having an identity crisis.
p182
aVShe said she thought she might like to work in art or entertainment,
p183
aVbut she hadn't decided yet,
p184
aVso she'd spent the last few years waiting tables instead.
p185
aVBecause it was cheaper, she lived with a boyfriend
p186
aVwho displayed his temper more than his ambition.
p187
aVAnd as hard as her 20s were,
p188
aVher early life had been even harder.
p189
aVShe often cried in our sessions,
p190
aVbut then would collect herself by saying,
p191
aV"You can't pick your family, but you can pick your friends."
p192
aa(lp193
VWell one day, Emma comes in and she hangs her head in her lap,
p194
aVand she sobbed for most of the hour.
p195
aVShe'd just bought a new address book,
p196
aVand she'd spent the morning filling in her many contacts,
p197
aVbut then she'd been left staring at that empty blank
p198
aVthat comes after the words
p199
aV"In case of emergency, please call ..."
p200
aVShe was nearly hysterical when she looked at me and said,
p201
aV"Who's going to be there for me if I get in a car wreck?
p202
aVWho's going to take care of me if I have cancer?"
p203
aa(lp204
VNow in that moment, it took everything I had
p205
aVnot to say, "I will."
p206
aVBut what Emma needed wasn't some therapist who really, really cared.
p207
aVEmma needed a better life, and I knew this was her chance.
p208
aVI had learned too much since I first worked with Alex
p209
aVto just sit there while Emma's defining decade
p210
aVwent parading by.
p211
aa(lp212
VSo over the next weeks and months,
p213
aVI told Emma three things
p214
aVthat every twentysomething, male or female,
p215
aVdeserves to hear.
p216
aa(lp217
VFirst, I told Emma to forget about having an identity crisis
p218
aVand get some identity capital.
p219
aVBy "get identity capital,"
p220
aVI mean do something that adds value to who you are.
p221
aVDo something that's an investment
p222
aVin who you might want to be next.
p223
aVI didn't know the future of Emma's career,
p224
aVand no one knows the future of work,
p225
aVbut I do know this:
p226
aVIdentity capital begets identity capital.
p227
aVSo now is the time for that cross-country job,
p228
aVthat internship, that startup you want to try.
p229
aVI'm not discounting twentysomething exploration here,
p230
aVbut I am discounting exploration that's not supposed to count,
p231
aVwhich, by the way, is not exploration.
p232
aVThat's procrastination.
p233
aVI told Emma to explore work and make it count.
p234
aa(lp235
VSecond, I told Emma that the urban tribe is overrated.
p236
aVBest friends are great for giving rides to the airport,
p237
aVbut twentysomethings who huddle together with like-minded peers
p238
aVlimit who they know,
p239
aVwhat they know, how they think,
p240
aVhow they speak, and where they work.
p241
aVThat new piece of capital, that new person to date
p242
aValmost always comes from outside the inner circle.
p243
aVNew things come from what are called our weak ties,
p244
aVour friends of friends of friends.
p245
aVSo yes, half of twentysomethings are un- or under-employed.
p246
aVBut half aren't,
p247
aVand weak ties are how you get yourself into that group.
p248
aVHalf of new jobs are never posted,
p249
aVso reaching out to your neighbor's boss is how you get that unposted job.
p250
aVIt's not cheating. It's the science of how information spreads.
p251
aa(lp252
VLast but not least, Emma believed
p253
aVthat you can't pick your family, but you can pick your friends.
p254
aVNow this was true for her growing up,
p255
aVbut as a twentysomething, soon Emma would pick her family
p256
aVwhen she partnered with someone and created a family of her own.
p257
aVI told Emma the time to start picking your family is now.
p258
aa(lp259
VNow you may be thinking that 30 is actually a better time to settle down
p260
aVthan 20, or even 25,
p261
aVand I agree with you.
p262
aVBut grabbing whoever you're living with or sleeping with
p263
aVwhen everyone on Facebook starts walking down the aisle
p264
aVis not progress.
p265
aVThe best time to work on your marriage is before you have one,
p266
aVand that means being as intentional with love
p267
aVas you are with work.
p268
aVPicking your family is about consciously choosing
p269
aVwho and what you want
p270
aVrather than just making it work or killing time
p271
aVwith whoever happens to be choosing you.
p272
aa(lp273
VSo what happened to Emma?
p274
aVWell, we went through that address book,
p275
aVand she found an old roommate's cousin
p276
aVwho worked at an art museum in another state.
p277
aVThat weak tie helped her get a job there.
p278
aVThat job offer gave her the reason to leave that live-in boyfriend.
p279
aVNow, five years later, she's a special events planner for museums.
p280
aVShe's married to a man she mindfully chose.
p281
aVShe loves her new career, she loves her new family,
p282
aVand she sent me a card that said,
p283
aV"Now the emergency contact blanks
p284
aVdon't seem big enough."
p285
aa(lp286
VNow Emma's story made that sound easy,
p287
aVbut that's what I love about working with twentysomethings.
p288
aVThey are so easy to help.
p289
aVTwentysomethings are like airplanes just leaving LAX,
p290
aVbound for somewhere west.
p291
aVRight after takeoff, a slight change in course
p292
aVis the difference between landing in Alaska or Fiji.
p293
aVLikewise, at 21 or 25 or even 29,
p294
aVone good conversation, one good break,
p295
aVone good TED Talk, can have an enormous effect
p296
aVacross years and even generations to come.
p297
aa(lp298
VSo here's an idea worth spreading
p299
aVto every twentysomething you know.
p300
aVIt's as simple as what I learned to say to Alex.
p301
aVIt's what I now have the privilege
p302
aVof saying to twentysomethings like Emma every single day:
p303
aVThirty is not the new 20, so claim your adulthood,
p304
aVget some identity capital, use your weak ties,
p305
aVpick your family.
p306
aVDon't be defined by what you didn't know
p307
aVor didn't do.
p308
aVYou're deciding your life right now.
p309
aa(lp310
VThank you.
