VSo I started working
p4
aVwith refugees because I wanted
p5
aVto make a difference,
p6
aVand making a difference starts
p7
aVwith telling their stories.
p8
aVSo when I meet refugees,
p9
aVI always ask them questions.
p10
aVWho bombed your house?
p11
aVWho killed your son?
p12
aVDid the rest of your family make it out alive?
p13
aVHow are you coping
p14
aVin your life in exile?
p15
aVBut there's one question that always seems to me
p16
aVto be most revealing, and that is:
p17
aVWhat did you take?
p18
aVWhat was that most important thing
p19
aVthat you had to take with you
p20
aVwhen the bombs were exploding in your town,
p21
aVand the armed gangs were approaching your house?
p22
aa(lp23
VA Syrian refugee boy I know
p24
aVtold me that he didn't hesitate
p25
aVwhen his life was in imminent danger.
p26
aVHe took his high school diploma,
p27
aVand later he told me why.
p28
aVHe said, "I took my high school diploma
p29
aVbecause my life depended on it."
p30
aVAnd he would risk his life to get that diploma.
p31
aVOn his way to school, he would dodge snipers.
p32
aVHis classroom sometimes shook
p33
aVwith the sound of bombs and shelling,
p34
aVand his mother told me,
p35
aV"Every day, I would say to him every morning,
p36
aV'Honey, please don't go to school.'"
p37
aVAnd when he insisted, she said,
p38
aV"I would hug him as if it were for the last time."
p39
aVBut he said to his mother,
p40
aV"We're all afraid,
p41
aVbut our determination to graduate
p42
aVis stronger than our fear."
p43
aa(lp44
VBut one day, the family got terrible news.
p45
aVHany's aunt, his uncle and his cousin
p46
aVwere murdered in their homes for refusing
p47
aVto leave their house.
p48
aVTheir throats were slit.
p49
aVIt was time to flee.
p50
aa(lp51
VThey left that day, right away, in their car,
p52
aVHany hidden in the back because they were facing
p53
aVcheckpoints of menacing soldiers.
p54
aVAnd they would cross the border into Lebanon,
p55
aVwhere they would find peace.
p56
aVBut they would begin a life of grueling hardship
p57
aVand monotony.
p58
aVThey had no choice but to build a shack
p59
aVon the side of a muddy field,
p60
aVand this is Hany's brother Ashraf,
p61
aVwho plays outside.
p62
aa(lp63
VAnd that day, they joined
p64
aVthe biggest population of refugees in the world,
p65
aVin a country, Lebanon, that is tiny.
p66
aVIt only has four million citizens,
p67
aVand there are one million Syrian refugees living there.
p68
aVThere's not a town, a city or a village
p69
aVthat is not host to Syrian refugees.
p70
aVThis is generosity and humanity
p71
aVthat is remarkable.
p72
aVThink about it this way, proportionately.
p73
aVIt would be as if
p74
aVthe entire population of Germany,
p75
aV80 million people,
p76
aVwould flee to the United States in just three years.
p77
aVHalf of the entire population of Syria
p78
aVis now uprooted,
p79
aVmost of them inside the country.
p80
aVSix and a half million people
p81
aVhave fled for their lives.
p82
aVOver and well over three million people
p83
aVhave crossed the borders
p84
aVand have found sanctuary in the neighboring countries,
p85
aVand only a small proportion, as you see,
p86
aVhave moved on to Europe.
p87
aVWhat I find most worrying
p88
aVis that half of all Syrian refugees are children.
p89
aVI took this picture of this little girl.
p90
aVIt was just two hours after she had arrived
p91
aVafter a long trek from Syria into Jordan.
p92
aa(lp93
VAnd most troubling of all
p94
aVis that only 20 percent of  Syrian refugee children
p95
aVare in school in Lebanon.
p96
aVAnd yet, Syrian refugee children,
p97
aVall refugee children tell us
p98
aVeducation is the most important thing in their lives.
p99
aVWhy? Because it allows them to think of their future
p100
aVrather than the nightmare of their past.
p101
aVIt allows them to think of hope rather than hatred.
p102
aa(lp103
VI'm reminded of a recent visit I took
p104
aVto a Syrian refugee camp in northern Iraq,
p105
aVand I met this girl,
p106
aVand I thought, "She's beautiful,"
p107
aVand I went up to her and asked her,
p108
aV"Can I take your picture?"
p109
aVAnd she said yes,
p110
aVbut she refused to smile.
p111
aVI think she couldn't,
p112
aVbecause I think she must realize that she represents
p113
aVa lost generation of Syrian refugee children,
p114
aVa generation isolated and frustrated.
p115
aVAnd yet, look at what they fled:
p116
aVutter destruction,
p117
aVbuildings, industries, schools, roads, homes.
p118
aVHany's home was also destroyed.
p119
aVThis will need to be rebuilt
p120
aVby architects, by engineers, by electricians.
p121
aVCommunities will need teachers and lawyers
p122
aVand politicians interested in reconciliation
p123
aVand not revenge.
p124
aVShouldn't this be rebuilt
p125
aVby the people with the largest stake,
p126
aVthe societies in exile, the refugees?
p127
aa(lp128
VRefugees have a lot of time
p129
aVto prepare for their return.
p130
aVYou might imagine that being a refugee
p131
aVis just a temporary state.
p132
aVWell far from it.
p133
aVWith wars going on and on,
p134
aVthe average time a refugee will spend in exile
p135
aVis 17 years.
p136
aVHany was into his second year in limbo
p137
aVwhen I went to visit him recently,
p138
aVand we conducted our entire conversation in English,
p139
aVwhich he confessed to me he learned
p140
aVfrom reading all of Dan Brown's novels
p141
aVand from listening to American rap.
p142
aVWe also spent some nice moments of laughter
p143
aVand fun with his beloved brother Ashraf.
p144
aVBut I'll never forget what he told me
p145
aVwhen we ended our conversation that day.
p146
aVHe said to me,
p147
aV"If I am not a student, I am nothing."
p148
aa(lp149
VHany is one of 50 million people
p150
aVuprooted in this world today.
p151
aVNever since World War II
p152
aVhave so many people been forcibly displaced.
p153
aVSo while we're making sweeping progress
p154
aVin human health,
p155
aVin technology, in education and design,
p156
aVwe are doing dangerously little
p157
aVto help the victims
p158
aVand we are doing far too little
p159
aVto stop and prevent
p160
aVthe wars that are driving them from their homes.
p161
aa(lp162
VAnd there are more and more victims.
p163
aVEvery day, on average,
p164
aVby the end of this day,
p165
aV32,000 people will be forcibly displaced
p166
aVfrom their homes \u2014
p167
aV32,000 people.
p168
aVThey flee across borders like this one.
p169
aVWe captured this on the Syrian border to Jordan,
p170
aVand this is a typical day.
p171
aVOr they flee on unseaworthy and overcrowded boats,
p172
aVrisking their lives in this case
p173
aVjust to reach safety in Europe.
p174
aVThis Syrian young man
p175
aVsurvived one of these boats that capsized \u2014
p176
aVmost of the people drowned \u2014
p177
aVand he told us,
p178
aV"Syrians are just looking for a quiet place
p179
aVwhere nobody hurts you,
p180
aVwhere nobody humiliates you,
p181
aVand where nobody kills you."
p182
aVWell, I think that should be the minimum.
p183
aVHow about a place of healing,
p184
aVof learning,
p185
aVand even opportunity?
p186
aVAmericans and Europeans
p187
aVhave the impression that proportionally
p188
aVhuge numbers of refugees are coming
p189
aVto their country,
p190
aVbut the reality is
p191
aVthat 86 percent, the vast majority of refugees,
p192
aVare living in the developing world,
p193
aVin countries struggling with their own insecurity,
p194
aVwith their own issues of helping their own populations
p195
aVand poverty.
p196
aVSo wealthy countries in the world should recognize
p197
aVthe humanity and the generosity of the countries
p198
aVthat are hosting so many refugees.
p199
aVAnd all countries should make sure that no one
p200
aVfleeing war and persecution
p201
aVarrives at a closed border.
p202
aa(lp203
V(Applause)
p204
aa(lp205
VThank you.
p206
aa(lp207
VBut there is something more that we can do
p208
aVthan just simply helping refugees survive.
p209
aVWe can help them thrive.
p210
aVWe should think of refugee camps and communities
p211
aVas more than just temporary population centers
p212
aVwhere people languish
p213
aVwaiting for the war to end.
p214
aVRather, as centers of excellence,
p215
aVwhere refugees can triumph over their trauma
p216
aVand train for the day that they can go home
p217
aVas agents of positive change
p218
aVand social transformation.
p219
aa(lp220
VIt makes so much sense,
p221
aVbut I'm reminded of the terrible war in Somalia
p222
aVthat has been raging on for 22 years.
p223
aVAnd imagine living in this camp.
p224
aVI visited this camp.
p225
aVIt's in Djibouti, neighboring Somalia,
p226
aVand it was so remote
p227
aVthat we had to take a helicopter to fly there.
p228
aVIt was dusty and it was terribly hot.
p229
aVAnd we went to visit a school
p230
aVand started talking to the children,
p231
aVand then I saw this girl across the room
p232
aVwho looked to me to be the same age
p233
aVas my own daughter, and I went up and talked to her.
p234
aVAnd I asked her the questions
p235
aVthat grown-ups ask kids,
p236
aVlike, "What is your favorite subject?"
p237
aVand, "What do you want to be when you grow up?"
p238
aVAnd this is when her face turned blank,
p239
aVand she said to me,
p240
aV"I have no future.
p241
aVMy schooling days are over."
p242
aVAnd I thought, there must be some misunderstanding,
p243
aVso I turned to my colleague
p244
aVand she confirmed to me
p245
aVthere is no funding for secondary education
p246
aVin this camp.
p247
aVAnd how I wished at that moment
p248
aVthat I could say to her,
p249
aV"We will build you a school."
p250
aVAnd I also thought, what a waste.
p251
aVShe should be and she is
p252
aVthe future of Somalia.
p253
aa(lp254
VA boy named Jacob Atem
p255
aVhad a different chance, but not before he experienced
p256
aVterribly tragedy.
p257
aVHe watched \u2014 this is in Sudan \u2014
p258
aVas his village \u2014 he was only seven years old \u2014
p259
aVburned to the ground, and he learned
p260
aVthat his mother and his father
p261
aVand his entire family
p262
aVwere killed that day.
p263
aVOnly his cousin survived, and the two of them
p264
aVwalked for seven months \u2014
p265
aVthis is boys like him \u2014
p266
aVchased and pursued by wild animals and armed gangs,
p267
aVand they finally made it to refugee camps
p268
aVwhere they found safety,
p269
aVand he would spend the next seven years
p270
aVin Kenya in a refugee camp.
p271
aa(lp272
VBut his life changed
p273
aVwhen he got the chance to be resettled
p274
aVto the United States,
p275
aVand he found love in a foster family
p276
aVand he was able to go to school,
p277
aVand he wanted me to share with you
p278
aVthis proud moment
p279
aVwhen he graduated from university.
p280
aa(lp281
V(Applause)
p282
aa(lp283
VI spoke to him on Skype the other day,
p284
aVand he was in his new university in Florida
p285
aVpursuing his Ph.D. in public health,
p286
aVand he proudly told me how he was able to raise
p287
aVenough funds from the American public
p288
aVto establish a health clinic back in his village
p289
aVback home.
p290
aa(lp291
VSo I want to take you back to Hany.
p292
aVWhen I told him I was going to have the chance
p293
aVto speak to you here on the TED stage,
p294
aVhe allowed me to read you a poem
p295
aVthat he sent in an email to me.
p296
aa(lp297
VHe wrote:
p298
aV"I miss myself,
p299
aVmy friends,
p300
aVtimes of reading novels or writing poems,
p301
aVbirds and tea in the morning.
p302
aVMy room, my books, myself,
p303
aVand everything that was making me smile.
p304
aVOh, oh, I had so many dreams
p305
aVthat were about to be realized."
p306
aa(lp307
VSo here is my point:
p308
aVNot investing in refugees
p309
aVis a huge missed opportunity.
p310
aVLeave them abandoned,
p311
aVand they risk exploitation and abuse,
p312
aVand leave them unskilled and uneducated,
p313
aVand delay by years the return
p314
aVto peace and prosperity in their countries.
p315
aVI believe how we treat the uprooted
p316
aVwill shape the future of our world.
p317
aVThe victims of war can hold the keys
p318
aVto lasting peace,
p319
aVand it's the refugees
p320
aVwho can stop the cycle of violence.
p321
aa(lp322
VHany is at a tipping point.
p323
aVWe would love to help him go to university
p324
aVand to become an engineer,
p325
aVbut our funds are prioritized for the basics in life:
p326
aVtents and blankets and mattresses and kitchen sets,
p327
aVfood rations and a bit of medicine.
p328
aVUniversity is a luxury.
p329
aVBut leave him to languish in this muddy field,
p330
aVand he will become a member
p331
aVof a lost generation.
p332
aVHany's story is a tragedy,
p333
aVbut it doesn't have to end that way.
p334
aa(lp335
VThank you.
