VIn the movie "Interstellar,"
p4
aVwe get an up-close look at a supermassive black hole.
p5
aVSet against a backdrop of bright gas,
p6
aVthe black hole's massive gravitational pull
p7
aVbends light into a ring.
p8
aVHowever, this isn't a real photograph,
p9
aVbut a computer graphic rendering \u2014
p10
aVan artistic interpretation of what a black hole might look like.
p11
aa(lp12
VA hundred years ago,
p13
aVAlbert Einstein first published his theory of general relativity.
p14
aVIn the years since then,
p15
aVscientists have provided a lot of evidence in support of it.
p16
aVBut one thing predicted from this theory, black holes,
p17
aVstill have not been directly observed.
p18
aVAlthough we have some idea as to what a black hole might look like,
p19
aVwe've never actually taken a picture of one before.
p20
aVHowever, you might be surprised to know that that may soon change.
p21
aVWe may be seeing our first picture of a black hole in the next couple years.
p22
aVGetting this first picture will come down to an international team of scientists,
p23
aVan Earth-sized telescope
p24
aVand an algorithm that puts together the final picture.
p25
aVAlthough I won't be able to show you a real picture of a black hole today,
p26
aVI'd like to give you a brief glimpse into the effort involved
p27
aVin getting that first picture.
p28
aa(lp29
VMy name is Katie Bouman,
p30
aVand I'm a PhD student at MIT.
p31
aVI do research in a computer science lab
p32
aVthat works on making computers see through images and video.
p33
aVBut although I'm not an astronomer,
p34
aVtoday I'd like to show you
p35
aVhow I've been able to contribute to this exciting project.
p36
aa(lp37
VIf you go out past the bright city lights tonight,
p38
aVyou may just be lucky enough to see a stunning view
p39
aVof the Milky Way Galaxy.
p40
aVAnd if you could zoom past millions of stars,
p41
aV26,000 light-years toward the heart of the spiraling Milky Way,
p42
aVwe'd eventually reach a cluster of stars right at the center.
p43
aVPeering past all the galactic dust with infrared telescopes,
p44
aVastronomers have watched these stars for over 16 years.
p45
aVBut it's what they don't see that is the most spectacular.
p46
aVThese stars seem to orbit an invisible object.
p47
aVBy tracking the paths of these stars,
p48
aVastronomers have concluded
p49
aVthat the only thing small and heavy enough to cause this motion
p50
aVis a supermassive black hole \u2014
p51
aVan object so dense that it sucks up anything that ventures too close \u2014
p52
aVeven light.
p53
aa(lp54
VBut what happens if we were to zoom in even further?
p55
aVIs it possible to see something that, by definition, is impossible to see?
p56
aVWell, it turns out that if we were to zoom in at radio wavelengths,
p57
aVwe'd expect to see a ring of light
p58
aVcaused by the gravitational lensing of hot plasma
p59
aVzipping around the black hole.
p60
aVIn other words,
p61
aVthe black hole casts a shadow on this backdrop of bright material,
p62
aVcarving out a sphere of darkness.
p63
aVThis bright ring reveals the black hole's event horizon,
p64
aVwhere the gravitational pull becomes so great
p65
aVthat not even light can escape.
p66
aVEinstein's equations predict the size and shape of this ring,
p67
aVso taking a picture of it wouldn't only be really cool,
p68
aVit would also help to verify that these equations hold
p69
aVin the extreme conditions around the black hole.
p70
aa(lp71
VHowever, this black hole is so far away from us,
p72
aVthat from Earth, this ring appears incredibly small \u2014
p73
aVthe same size to us as an orange on the surface of the moon.
p74
aVThat makes taking a picture of it extremely difficult.
p75
aVWhy is that?
p76
aVWell, it all comes down to a simple equation.
p77
aVDue to a phenomenon called diffraction,
p78
aVthere are fundamental limits
p79
aVto the smallest objects that we can possibly see.
p80
aVThis governing equation says that in order to see smaller and smaller,
p81
aVwe need to make our telescope bigger and bigger.
p82
aVBut even with the most powerful optical telescopes here on Earth,
p83
aVwe can't even get close to the resolution necessary
p84
aVto image on the surface of the moon.
p85
aVIn fact, here I show one of the highest resolution images ever taken
p86
aVof the moon from Earth.
p87
aVIt contains roughly 13,000 pixels,
p88
aVand yet each pixel would contain over 1.5 million oranges.
p89
aa(lp90
VSo how big of a telescope do we need
p91
aVin order to see an orange on the surface of the moon
p92
aVand, by extension, our black hole?
p93
aVWell, it turns out that by crunching the numbers,
p94
aVyou can easily calculate that we would need a telescope
p95
aVthe size of the entire Earth.
p96
aa(lp97
V(Laughter)
p98
aa(lp99
VIf we could build this Earth-sized telescope,
p100
aVwe could just start to make out that distinctive ring of light
p101
aVindicative of the black hole's event horizon.
p102
aVAlthough this picture wouldn't contain all the detail we see
p103
aVin computer graphic renderings,
p104
aVit would allow us to safely get our first glimpse
p105
aVof the immediate environment around a black hole.
p106
aa(lp107
VHowever, as you can imagine,
p108
aVbuilding a single-dish telescope the size of the Earth is impossible.
p109
aVBut in the famous words of Mick Jagger,
p110
aV"You can't always get what you want,
p111
aVbut if you try sometimes, you just might find
p112
aVyou get what you need."
p113
aVAnd by connecting telescopes from around the world,
p114
aVan international collaboration called the Event Horizon Telescope
p115
aVis creating a computational telescope the size of the Earth,
p116
aVcapable of resolving structure
p117
aVon the scale of a black hole's event horizon.
p118
aVThis network of telescopes is scheduled to take its very first picture
p119
aVof a black hole next year.
p120
aVEach telescope in the worldwide network works together.
p121
aVLinked through the precise timing of atomic clocks,
p122
aVteams of researchers at each of the sights freeze light
p123
aVby collecting thousands of terabytes of data.
p124
aVThis data is then processed in a lab right here in Massachusetts.
p125
aa(lp126
VSo how does this even work?
p127
aVRemember if we want to see the black hole in the center of our galaxy,
p128
aVwe need to build this impossibly large Earth-sized telescope?
p129
aVFor just a second, let's pretend we could build
p130
aVa telescope the size of the Earth.
p131
aVThis would be a little bit like turning the Earth
p132
aVinto a giant spinning disco ball.
p133
aVEach individual mirror would collect light
p134
aVthat we could then combine together to make a picture.
p135
aVHowever, now let's say we remove most of those mirrors
p136
aVso only a few remained.
p137
aVWe could still try to combine this information together,
p138
aVbut now there are a lot of holes.
p139
aVThese remaining mirrors represent the locations where we have telescopes.
p140
aVThis is an incredibly small number of measurements to make a picture from.
p141
aVBut although we only collect light at a few telescope locations,
p142
aVas the Earth rotates, we get to see other new measurements.
p143
aVIn other words, as the disco ball spins, those mirrors change locations
p144
aVand we get to observe different parts of the image.
p145
aVThe imaging algorithms we develop fill in the missing gaps of the disco ball
p146
aVin order to reconstruct the underlying black hole image.
p147
aVIf we had telescopes located everywhere on the globe \u2014
p148
aVin other words, the entire disco ball \u2014
p149
aVthis would be trivial.
p150
aVHowever, we only see a few samples, and for that reason,
p151
aVthere are an infinite number of possible images
p152
aVthat are perfectly consistent with our telescope measurements.
p153
aVHowever, not all images are created equal.
p154
aVSome of those images look more like what we think of as images than others.
p155
aVAnd so, my role in helping to take the first image of a black hole
p156
aVis to design algorithms that find the most reasonable image
p157
aVthat also fits the telescope measurements.
p158
aa(lp159
VJust as a forensic sketch artist uses limited descriptions
p160
aVto piece together a picture using their knowledge of face structure,
p161
aVthe imaging algorithms I develop use our limited telescope data
p162
aVto guide us to a picture that also looks like stuff in our universe.
p163
aVUsing these algorithms, we're able to piece together pictures
p164
aVfrom this sparse, noisy data.
p165
aVSo here I show a sample reconstruction done using simulated data,
p166
aVwhen we pretend to point our telescopes
p167
aVto the black hole in the center of our galaxy.
p168
aVAlthough this is just a simulation, reconstruction such as this give us hope
p169
aVthat we'll soon be able to reliably take the first image of a black hole
p170
aVand from it, determine the size of its ring.
p171
aVAlthough I'd love to go on about all the details of this algorithm,
p172
aVluckily for you, I don't have the time.
p173
aa(lp174
VBut I'd still like to give you a brief idea
p175
aVof how we define what our universe looks like,
p176
aVand how we use this to reconstruct and verify our results.
p177
aVSince there are an infinite number of possible images
p178
aVthat perfectly explain our telescope measurements,
p179
aVwe have to choose between them in some way.
p180
aVWe do this by ranking the images
p181
aVbased upon how likely they are to be the black hole image,
p182
aVand then choosing the one that's most likely.
p183
aa(lp184
VSo what do I mean by this exactly?
p185
aVLet's say we were trying to make a model
p186
aVthat told us how likely an image were to appear on Facebook.
p187
aVWe'd probably want the model to say
p188
aVit's pretty unlikely that someone would post this noise image on the left,
p189
aVand pretty likely that someone would post a selfie
p190
aVlike this one on the right.
p191
aVThe image in the middle is blurry,
p192
aVso even though it's more likely we'd see it on Facebook
p193
aVcompared to the noise image,
p194
aVit's probably less likely we'd see it compared to the selfie.
p195
aa(lp196
VBut when it comes to images from the black hole,
p197
aVwe're posed with a real conundrum: we've never seen a black hole before.
p198
aVIn that case, what is a likely black hole image,
p199
aVand what should we assume about the structure of black holes?
p200
aVWe could try to use images from simulations we've done,
p201
aVlike the image of the black hole from "Interstellar,"
p202
aVbut if we did this, it could cause some serious problems.
p203
aVWhat would happen if Einstein's theories didn't hold?
p204
aVWe'd still want to reconstruct an accurate picture of what was going on.
p205
aVIf we bake Einstein's equations too much into our algorithms,
p206
aVwe'll just end up seeing what we expect to see.
p207
aVIn other words, we want to leave the option open
p208
aVfor there being a giant elephant at the center of our galaxy.
p209
aa(lp210
V(Laughter)
p211
aa(lp212
VDifferent types of images have very distinct features.
p213
aVWe can easily tell the difference between black hole simulation images
p214
aVand images we take every day here on Earth.
p215
aVWe need a way to tell our algorithms what images look like
p216
aVwithout imposing one type of image's features too much.
p217
aVOne way we can try to get around this
p218
aVis by imposing the features of different kinds of images
p219
aVand seeing how the type of image we assume affects our reconstructions.
p220
aVIf all images' types produce a very similar-looking image,
p221
aVthen we can start to become more confident
p222
aVthat the image assumptions we're making are not biasing this picture that much.
p223
aa(lp224
VThis is a little bit like giving the same description
p225
aVto three different sketch artists from all around the world.
p226
aVIf they all produce a very similar-looking face,
p227
aVthen we can start to become confident
p228
aVthat they're not imposing their own cultural biases on the drawings.
p229
aVOne way we can try to impose different image features
p230
aVis by using pieces of existing images.
p231
aVSo we take a large collection of images,
p232
aVand we break them down into their little image patches.
p233
aVWe then can treat each image patch a little bit like pieces of a puzzle.
p234
aVAnd we use commonly seen puzzle pieces to piece together an image
p235
aVthat also fits our telescope measurements.
p236
aa(lp237
VDifferent types of images have very distinctive sets of puzzle pieces.
p238
aVSo what happens when we take the same data
p239
aVbut we use different sets of puzzle pieces to reconstruct the image?
p240
aVLet's first start with black hole image simulation puzzle pieces.
p241
aVOK, this looks reasonable.
p242
aVThis looks like what we expect a black hole to look like.
p243
aVBut did we just get it
p244
aVbecause we just fed it little pieces of black hole simulation images?
p245
aVLet's try another set of puzzle pieces
p246
aVfrom astronomical, non-black hole objects.
p247
aVOK, we get a similar-looking image.
p248
aVAnd then how about pieces from everyday images,
p249
aVlike the images you take with your own personal camera?
p250
aVGreat, we see the same image.
p251
aVWhen we get the same image from all different sets of puzzle pieces,
p252
aVthen we can start to become more confident
p253
aVthat the image assumptions we're making
p254
aVaren't biasing the final image we get too much.
p255
aa(lp256
VAnother thing we can do is take the same set of puzzle pieces,
p257
aVsuch as the ones derived from everyday images,
p258
aVand use them to reconstruct many different kinds of source images.
p259
aVSo in our simulations,
p260
aVwe pretend a black hole looks like astronomical non-black hole objects,
p261
aVas well as everyday images like the elephant in the center of our galaxy.
p262
aVWhen the results of our algorithms on the bottom look very similar
p263
aVto the simulation's truth image on top,
p264
aVthen we can start to become more confident in our algorithms.
p265
aVAnd I really want to emphasize here
p266
aVthat all of these pictures were created
p267
aVby piecing together little pieces of everyday photographs,
p268
aVlike you'd take with your own personal camera.
p269
aVSo an image of a black hole we've never seen before
p270
aVmay eventually be created by piecing together pictures we see all the time
p271
aVof people, buildings, trees, cats and dogs.
p272
aVImaging ideas like this will make it possible for us
p273
aVto take our very first pictures of a black hole,
p274
aVand hopefully, verify those famous theories
p275
aVon which scientists rely on a daily basis.
p276
aa(lp277
VBut of course, getting imaging ideas like this working
p278
aVwould never have been possible without the amazing team of researchers
p279
aVthat I have the privilege to work with.
p280
aVIt still amazes me
p281
aVthat although I began this project with no background in astrophysics,
p282
aVwhat we have achieved through this unique collaboration
p283
aVcould result in the very first images of a black hole.
p284
aVBut big projects like the Event Horizon Telescope
p285
aVare successful due to all the interdisciplinary expertise
p286
aVdifferent people bring to the table.
p287
aVWe're a melting pot of astronomers,
p288
aVphysicists, mathematicians and engineers.
p289
aVThis is what will make it soon possible
p290
aVto achieve something once thought impossible.
p291
aa(lp292
VI'd like to encourage all of you to go out
p293
aVand help push the boundaries of science,
p294
aVeven if it may at first seem as mysterious to you as a black hole.
p295
aa(lp296
VThank you.
