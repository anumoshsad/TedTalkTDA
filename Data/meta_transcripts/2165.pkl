VLet's go south.
p4
aVAll of you are actually going south.
p5
aVThis is the direction of south, this way,
p6
aVand if you go 8,000 kilometers out of the back of this room,
p7
aVyou will come to as far south as you can go anywhere on Earth,
p8
aVthe Pole itself.
p9
aa(lp10
VNow, I am not an explorer.
p11
aVI'm not an environmentalist.
p12
aVI'm actually just a survivor,
p13
aVand these photographs that I'm showing you here are dangerous.
p14
aVThey are the ice melt of the South and North Poles.
p15
aVAnd ladies and gentlemen,
p16
aVwe need to listen to what these places are telling us,
p17
aVand if we don't, we will end up with our own survival situation
p18
aVhere on planet Earth.
p19
aa(lp20
VI have faced head-on these places,
p21
aVand to walk across a melting ocean of ice
p22
aVis without doubt the most frightening thing
p23
aVthat's ever happened to me.
p24
aa(lp25
VAntarctica is such a hopeful place.
p26
aVIt is protected by  the Antarctic Treaty, signed in 1959.
p27
aVIn 1991, a 50-year agreement was entered into
p28
aVthat stops any exploitation in Antarctica,
p29
aVand this agreement could be altered,
p30
aVchanged, modified, or even abandoned
p31
aVstarting in the year 2041.
p32
aVLadies and gentlemen,
p33
aVpeople already far up north from here in the Arctic
p34
aVare already taking advantage
p35
aVof this ice melt,
p36
aVtaking out resources from areas already that have been covered in ice
p37
aVfor the last 10, 20, 30,000,
p38
aV100,000 years.
p39
aVCan they not join the dots
p40
aVand think, "Why is the ice actually melting?"
p41
aa(lp42
VThis is such an amazing place,
p43
aVthe Antarctic, and I have worked hard
p44
aVfor the last 23 years on this mission
p45
aVto make sure that what's happening up here in the North
p46
aVdoes never happen,  cannot happen in the South.
p47
aa(lp48
VWhere did this all begin?
p49
aVIt began for me at the age of 11.
p50
aVCheck out that haircut.  It's a bit odd. (Laughter)
p51
aVAnd at the age of 11,  I was inspired by the real explorers
p52
aVto want to try to be the first to walk to both Poles.
p53
aVI found it incredibly inspiring
p54
aVthat the idea of becoming a polar traveler
p55
aVwent down pretty well with girls  at parties when I was at university.
p56
aVThat was a bit more inspiring.
p57
aVAnd after years, seven years of fundraising,
p58
aVseven years of being told no,
p59
aVseven years of being told by my family to seek counseling
p60
aVand psychiatric help,
p61
aVeventually three of us found ourselves marching to the South Geographic Pole
p62
aVon the longest unassisted march ever made anywhere on Earth in history.
p63
aVIn this photograph, we are standing in an area
p64
aVthe size of the United States of America,
p65
aVand we're on our own.
p66
aVWe have no radio  communications, no backup.
p67
aVBeneath our feet, 90 percent of all the world's ice,
p68
aV70 percent of all the world's fresh water.
p69
aVWe're standing on it.
p70
aVThis is the power of Antarctica.
p71
aa(lp72
VOn this journey, we faced the danger of crevasses,
p73
aVintense cold,
p74
aVso cold that sweat turns to ice inside your clothing,
p75
aVyour teeth can crack,
p76
aVwater can freeze in your eyes.
p77
aVLet's just say it's a bit chilly. (Laughter)
p78
aVAnd after 70 desperate days, we arrive at the South Pole.
p79
aVWe had done it.
p80
aVBut something happened to me on that 70-day journey in 1986
p81
aVthat brought me here, and it hurt.
p82
aVMy eyes changed color in 70 days through damage.
p83
aVOur faces blistered out.
p84
aVThe skin ripped off and we wondered why.
p85
aVAnd when we got home, we were told by NASA
p86
aVthat a hole in the ozone had been discovered
p87
aVabove the South Pole,
p88
aVand we'd walked underneath it the same year it had been discovered.
p89
aVUltraviolet rays down, hit the ice, bounced back, fried out the eyes,
p90
aVripped off our faces.
p91
aVIt was a bit of a shock \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p92
aVand it started me thinking.
p93
aa(lp94
VIn 1989, we now head north.
p95
aVSixty days, every step away from the safety of land
p96
aVacross a frozen ocean.
p97
aVIt was desperately cold again.
p98
aVHere's me coming in from washing naked at -60 Celsius.
p99
aVAnd if anybody ever says to you, "I am cold" \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p100
aVif they look like this,  they are cold, definitely.
p101
aV(Applause)
p102
aa(lp103
VAnd 1,000 kilometers away from the safety of land,
p104
aVdisaster strikes.
p105
aVThe Arctic Ocean melts beneath our feet four months before it ever had in history,
p106
aVand we're 1,000 kilometers from safety.
p107
aVThe ice is crashing around us, grinding, and I'm thinking, "Are we going to die?"
p108
aVBut something clicked in my head on this day,
p109
aVas I realized we, as a world, are in a survival situation,
p110
aVand that feeling has never gone away for 25 long years.
p111
aVBack then, we had to march or die.
p112
aVAnd we're not some TV survivor program.
p113
aVWhen things go wrong for us, it's life or death,
p114
aVand our brave African-American Daryl,
p115
aVwho would become the first American to walk to the North Pole,
p116
aVhis heel dropped off  from frostbite 200 klicks out.
p117
aVHe must keep going, he does,
p118
aVand after 60 days on the ice, we stood at the North Pole.
p119
aVWe had done it.
p120
aVYes, I became the first person in history stupid enough to walk to both Poles,
p121
aVbut it was our success.
p122
aa(lp123
VAnd sadly, on return home,
p124
aVit was not all fun.
p125
aVI became very low.
p126
aVTo succeed at something is often harder than actually making it happen.
p127
aVI was empty, lonely, financially destroyed.
p128
aVI was without hope,
p129
aVbut hope came in the form of the great Jacques Cousteau,
p130
aVand he inspired me to take on  the 2041 mission.
p131
aVBeing Jacques, he gave me clear instructions:
p132
aVEngage the world leaders, talk to industry and business,
p133
aVand above all, Rob, inspire young people,
p134
aVbecause they will choose the future of the preservation of Antarctica.
p135
aa(lp136
VFor the world leaders, we've been to every world Earth Summit,
p137
aVall three of them, with our brave yacht, 2041,
p138
aVtwice to Rio, once in '92, once in 2012,
p139
aVand for the Earth Summit in Johannesburg,
p140
aVwe made the longest overland voyage ever made with a yacht,
p141
aV13,000 kilometers around the whole of Southern Africa
p142
aVdoing our best to inspire over a million young people in person
p143
aVabout 2041 and about their environment.
p144
aa(lp145
VFor the last 11 years, we have taken over 1,000 people,
p146
aVpeople from industry and business, women and men from companies,
p147
aVstudents from all over the world, down to Antarctica,
p148
aVand during those missions, we've managed to pull out
p149
aVover 1,500 tons of twisted metal left in Antarctica.
p150
aVThat took eight years, and I'm so proud of it
p151
aVbecause we recycled all of it  back here in South America.
p152
aVI have been inspired ever since I could walk
p153
aVto recycle by my mum.
p154
aVHere she is, and my mum \u2014
p155
aV(Applause) \u2014
p156
aVmy mum is still recycling,
p157
aVand as she is in her 100th year, isn't that fantastic?
p158
aV(Applause)
p159
aVAnd when \u2014 I love my mum.
p160
aV(Laughter)
p161
aVBut when Mum was born,
p162
aVthe population of our planet was only 1.8 billion people,
p163
aVand talking in terms of billions,
p164
aVwe have taken young people from industry and business
p165
aVfrom India, from China.
p166
aVThese are game-changing nations, and will be hugely important
p167
aVin the decision about the preservation of the Antarctic.
p168
aVUnbelievably, we've engaged and inspired women to come from the Middle East,
p169
aVoften for the first time they've  represented their nations in Antarctica.
p170
aVFantastic people, so inspired.
p171
aVTo look after Antarctica,
p172
aVyou've got to first engage people with this extraordinary place,
p173
aVform a relationship, form a bond,
p174
aVform some love.
p175
aVIt is such a privilege to go to Antarctica,
p176
aVI can't tell you.
p177
aVI feel so lucky,
p178
aVand I've been 35 times in my life,
p179
aVand all those people who come with us return home as great champions,
p180
aVnot only for Antarctica,
p181
aVbut for local issues back in their own nations.
p182
aa(lp183
VLet's go back to where we began: the ice melt of the North and South Poles.
p184
aVAnd it's not good news.
p185
aVNASA informed us six months ago
p186
aVthat the Western Antarctic Ice Shelf is now disintegrating.
p187
aVHuge areas of ice \u2014
p188
aVlook how big Antarctica is even compared to here \u2014
p189
aVHuge areas of ice  are breaking off from Antarctica,
p190
aVthe size of small nations.
p191
aVAnd NASA have calculated that the sea level will rise,
p192
aVit is definite,
p193
aVby one meter in the next 100 years,
p194
aVthe same time that my mum has been on planet Earth.
p195
aVIt's going to happen,
p196
aVand I've realized that  the preservation of Antarctica
p197
aVand our survival here on Earth are linked.
p198
aVAnd there is a very simple solution.
p199
aVIf we are using more renewable energy in the real world,
p200
aVif we are being more efficient with the energy here,
p201
aVrunning our energy mix in a cleaner way,
p202
aVthere will be no financial reason to go and exploit Antarctica.
p203
aVIt won't make financial sense,
p204
aVand if we manage our energy better, we also may be able to slow down,
p205
aVmaybe even stop,
p206
aVthis great ice melt that threatens us.
p207
aa(lp208
VIt's a big challenge, and what is our response to it?
p209
aVWe've got to go back one last time,
p210
aVand at the end of next year,
p211
aVwe will go back to the South Geographic Pole,
p212
aVwhere we arrived 30 years ago on foot,
p213
aVand retrace our steps of 1,600 kilometers,
p214
aVbut this time only using renewable energy to survive.
p215
aVWe will walk across those icecaps, which far down below are melting,
p216
aVhopefully inspiring some solutions on that issue.
p217
aa(lp218
VThis is my son, Barney.
p219
aVHe is coming with me.
p220
aVHe is committed to walking side by side with his father,
p221
aVand what he will do is to translate these messages
p222
aVand inspire these messages to the minds of future young leaders.
p223
aVI'm extremely proud of him.
p224
aVGood on him, Barney.
p225
aa(lp226
VLadies and gentlemen,  a survivor \u2014 and I'm good \u2014
p227
aVa survivor sees a problem and doesn't go, "Whatever."
p228
aVA survivor sees a problem and deals with that problem
p229
aVbefore it becomes a threat.
p230
aVWe have 27 years to preserve the Antarctic.
p231
aVWe all own it.
p232
aVWe all have responsibility.
p233
aVThe fact that nobody owns it  maybe means that we can succeed.
p234
aVAntarctica is a moral line in the snow,
p235
aVand on one side of that line we should fight,
p236
aVfight hard for this one beautiful, pristine place left alone on Earth.
p237
aVI know it's possible.
p238
aVWe are going to do it.
p239
aVAnd I'll leave you with these words from Goethe.
p240
aVI've tried to live by them.
p241
aa(lp242
V"If you can do, or dream you can,
p243
aVbegin it now,
p244
aVfor boldness has genius, power and magic in it."
p245
aa(lp246
VGood luck to you all.
p247
