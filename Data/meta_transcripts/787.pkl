VI have a vision for each one of you,
p4
aVand the vision I have for you
p5
aVis that when you wake up in the morning,
p6
aVyour blood is singing at the thought of being who you are
p7
aVand doing what you do;
p8
aVthat as you go through the day,
p9
aVyou can literally sink to your knees in gratitude
p10
aVat the tremendous good fortune that's been bestowed on you;
p11
aVthat as you go through the day,
p12
aVyou become radiantly alive several times.
p13
aVAnd if your life isn't like that,
p14
aVI'd like to humbly suggest that you're wasting your life.
p15
aVA life is too short to be wasted.
p16
aa(lp17
VSo what I propose to do in the next 17 minutes \u2014
p18
aVI've used up one minute already \u2014
p19
aVis to give you a set of powerful tools
p20
aVwhich can get you started on being there.
p21
aVIs that of interest to you?
p22
aa(lp23
VAudience: Yes.
p24
aa(lp25
VSrikumar Rao: OK.
p26
aa(lp27
VThis is a conference on happiness,
p28
aVbut even if it wasn't a conference on happiness,
p29
aVwould it be right if I said that in some way, shape, fashion or form,
p30
aVyou're devoting your entire life
p31
aVto being happy?
p32
aVEverything you do \u2014 your job, family, children, relationships, whatever \u2014
p33
aVis a quest for happiness.
p34
aVCorrect?
p35
aa(lp36
VI'd like you to think about the following:
p37
aVWhat do you have to get
p38
aVin order to be happy?
p39
aVWe're just going to spend a minute on this.
p40
aVWhat do you have to get in order to be happy?
p41
aa(lp42
VAnybody, quick?
p43
aa(lp44
VWhen I conduct this experiment, a bunch of stuff comes up:
p45
aVvast wealth, trophy spouse, good health, lots of travel, time, etc, etc, etc.
p46
aVRight now, if you were to think about it,
p47
aVyou probably have a list of, "Here's what I need to get
p48
aVin order to be happy."
p49
aVI would like you to consider this:
p50
aVanything that you can get \u2014
p51
aVlet me repeat that \u2014 anything you can get, you can un-get.
p52
aVIs that correct?
p53
aVSo, vast wealth can make you happy. Vast wealth can disappear tomorrow.
p54
aVA number of people in the financial sector have discovered this already.
p55
aVSo whatever you get that can make you happy
p56
aVcan go away.
p57
aVWhere does that leave you?
p58
aVNot a very nice place, right?
p59
aa(lp60
VI have a different proposition to suggest to you.
p61
aVWhat I have to suggest to you
p62
aVis that there is nothing that you have to get, do or be
p63
aVin order to be happy.
p64
aVLet me repeat that:
p65
aVthere is nothing that you have to get, do or be in order to be happy.
p66
aVIn fact, happiness is your innate nature.
p67
aVIt is hardwired into you. It is part of your DNA.
p68
aVYou cannot not be happy.
p69
aa(lp70
VNow, all of you are very polite,
p71
aVand in some of the other forums I speak in, such as top business schools,
p72
aVthey're not so polite.
p73
aVAnd invariably, somebody articulates what many of you are thinking,
p74
aVwhich is: "If happiness is my innate nature,
p75
aVhow come I am not experiencing it?
p76
aVHow come I am experiencing my life sucks?"
p77
aa(lp78
V(Laughter)
p79
aa(lp80
VAnd the answer to that is actually very simple.
p81
aVYou have spent your entire life
p82
aVlearning to be unhappy.
p83
aVLet me repeat that: you have spent your entire life learning to be unhappy.
p84
aVAnd the way we learn to be unhappy
p85
aVis by buying into a particular mental model.
p86
aa(lp87
VA mental model is a notion we have that this is the way the world works.
p88
aVAll of us have mental models, we've got dozens of mental models.
p89
aVWe've got mental models on how to find a job,
p90
aVhow to get ahead at work, how to pick a restaurant to eat at,
p91
aVhow to have a movie to go to ... dozens of them.
p92
aVThe problem isn't that we have mental models.
p93
aVThe problem is that we don't know that we have mental models.
p94
aVWe think this is the way the world works.
p95
aVAnd the more we invest in a mental model,
p96
aVthe more it appears that this, in fact, is the way the world works.
p97
aVBut it isn't: it's just a mental model,
p98
aVand the mental model we have that we buy into so strongly
p99
aVis that we have to get something so we can do something
p100
aVso we can be something.
p101
aVLike, we have to get a great deal of money so we can travel to exotic places
p102
aVso we can be happy.
p103
aVWe have to be in a relationship so we can have great sex
p104
aVso we can be happy.
p105
aa(lp106
VAll of this is a variation of the if-then model.
p107
aVAnd the if-then model is:
p108
aVif this happens,
p109
aVthen we will be happy.
p110
aVIf I were to get a better job, if I were to get more money,
p111
aVif my boss would have a heart attack,
p112
aVif only I was married, if only my wife would leave me \u2014
p113
aa(lp114
V(Laughter)
p115
aa(lp116
Vif only I had children,
p117
aVif my children would grow up and go to college ...
p118
aVIt doesn't matter what it is.
p119
aVThe whole notion is if this happens,
p120
aVthen I will be happy.
p121
aa(lp122
VAnd right now, the only thing that's different
p123
aVbetween the persons in this audience
p124
aVis what is the particular "if" that you are focusing on?
p125
aVAnd the only thing that's different
p126
aVbetween you now and where you were 10 years ago
p127
aVis what is the particular "if" that you were focusing on?
p128
aVThink about your life 10 years ago.
p129
aVSpend a minute doing that.
p130
aVTen years ago, if you remember clearly,
p131
aVthere were certain things you wanted.
p132
aVIs that correct?
p133
aVOdds are pretty good
p134
aVthat many of those things you wanted 10 years ago you now have.
p135
aVIs that correct?
p136
aVWhere has that left you?
p137
aVIn exactly the same place, right?
p138
aa(lp139
VWhat we don't realize is the model itself is flawed.
p140
aVThe if-then model \u2014 "If this happens I will be happy" \u2014
p141
aVthe model itself is flawed.
p142
aVBut instead of recognizing that it is the model itself that's flawed,
p143
aVwhat we do is spend enormous amounts of time
p144
aVchanging the "if."
p145
aV"Oh, well, I thought if I became CEO it would help,
p146
aVbut now I realize it's not that I want to become a CEO.
p147
aVI want to become the billionaire CEO,
p148
aVand then I will be happy."
p149
aVYou've got your own variation on that.
p150
aVBut it's the model itself that's flawed, not what you put on the "if" side
p151
aVof the equation.
p152
aVI can demonstrate that to you.
p153
aa(lp154
VCan any of you recall a time
p155
aVwhen you were confronted with a scene of such spectacular beauty
p156
aVthat it took you outside of yourself into a place of great serenity?
p157
aVMaybe a rainbow, a mountain range,
p158
aVa valley, the sea.
p159
aVAnd if you remember that \u2014 raise your hands if you could.
p160
aVVirtually all of you could, right?
p161
aVHave you ever wondered why that happened?
p162
aVThe reason that happened is that somehow,
p163
aVfor some reason,
p164
aVat that instant,
p165
aVyou accepted the universe exactly as it was.
p166
aVYou didn't say,
p167
aV"That's a beautiful rainbow, but it's kind of off to the left,
p168
aVand if I could move it 200 yards to the right,
p169
aVit would be ever so much more beautiful."
p170
aa(lp171
V(Laughter)
p172
aa(lp173
VYou didn't say, "That's a beautiful valley,
p174
aVbut the tree in the foreground has too many crooked branches.
p175
aVSo if you gave me a chainsaw and 20 minutes,
p176
aVI'd make it ever so much better."
p177
aa(lp178
VOh no, the rainbow off-center
p179
aVwas just fine.
p180
aVThe tree with its crooked branches
p181
aVwas just fine.
p182
aVAnd the moment you accepted the universe just as it was,
p183
aVyour habitual-wanting self dropped away,
p184
aVand the happiness which is your innate nature surfaced,
p185
aVand you felt it.
p186
aVAnd I know you felt it because now,
p187
aVeven now after all those years,
p188
aVyou can still remember it.
p189
aa(lp190
VThe problem is that your life right now,
p191
aVwith all of the problems that you have \u2014
p192
aVmore precisely, all of the problems that you think you have \u2014
p193
aVis equally perfect.
p194
aVBut you do not accept it.
p195
aVIn fact, you're spending all your time
p196
aVstriving with might and main to make it different.
p197
aVYou are not accepting it.
p198
aVAnd when you're not accepting it,
p199
aVyou're buying into the if-then model:
p200
aVif this happens, then I will be happy.
p201
aVAnd it's the model itself that is flawed.
p202
aa(lp203
VSo let me show you how you can get out of that,
p204
aVor at least you can begin the steps towards getting out of that.
p205
aVI'd like to share with you that action.
p206
aVWe all live our lives because we want to achieve something, correct?
p207
aVYou know, we are here and we want to have something.
p208
aVAlex wants to have a successful conference.
p209
aVYou know, many of you want to have great programs for your companies
p210
aVthat are very successful.
p211
aVYou want to progress, have more money, all of that, is that correct?
p212
aVEach of those is an outcome; you would like something to happen.
p213
aa(lp214
VNow, I'd like you to think about the following:
p215
aVactions are within your control,
p216
aVnot entirely, but to a large extent.
p217
aVThe outcome is completely out of your control.
p218
aVOK?
p219
aVActions are within your control.
p220
aVThe outcome is completely outside your control.
p221
aa(lp222
VHave any of you recognized that when you have a goal
p223
aVand you start to work towards it,
p224
aVsome of the time you don't achieve your goal,
p225
aVand some of the time what you get
p226
aVis the exact opposite of what you wanted?
p227
aVHas that happened to any of you?
p228
aa(lp229
VLike there was a friend of mine who said, "Gee, you know,
p230
aVI have not been paying a lot of attention to my wife,
p231
aVand this has to change."
p232
aVSo the next time we went on a business trip,
p233
aVhe bought a very expensive dress for her.
p234
aVAnd this was his way of showing, you know, I care for you,
p235
aVand nice things would happen.
p236
aVAnd when he presented the gift to his wife, her immediate reaction was,
p237
aV"After 20 years of marriage, you don't know my size?"
p238
aa(lp239
V(Laughter)
p240
aa(lp241
V"And furthermore, don't you know I never wear this kind of thing?"
p242
aVAnd the next thing you know, he had a full-blown marital spat.
p243
aVHas that happened to any of you?
p244
aVYou've taken action for a particular outcome
p245
aVand the outcome you got was the exact opposite
p246
aVof what you wanted?
p247
aVHappens all the time.
p248
aa(lp249
VWell, we live in a world where what we think of,
p250
aVwhat we invest in,
p251
aVis the outcome.
p252
aVWe define our life in the following way:
p253
aVhere I am, here is where I want to go,
p254
aVthese are the steps I have to take in order to get from where I am
p255
aVto where I want to go,
p256
aVand if I succeed, life is wonderful.
p257
aVAnd if I don't, then I have failed,
p258
aVlife is no good, life sucks.
p259
aVTrue? False?
p260
aVThat is how we live.
p261
aVWe invest in the outcome,
p262
aVand as I've just pointed out,
p263
aVthe outcome is frequently different from what we would like,
p264
aVand sometimes the diametric opposite of what we would like.
p265
aVYou invest in the outcome and you are guaranteed to have
p266
aVmore than your share of frustration, angst
p267
aVand all the rest of the stuff that makes life suck.
p268
aa(lp269
VThere is an alternative.
p270
aVAnd the alternative is that you do not invest in the outcome,
p271
aVyou invest in the process.
p272
aVAnd the best way to describe that is a quote by John Wooden.
p273
aVI don't know how many of you are familiar with John Wooden.
p274
aVHe's very well-known in the United States
p275
aVand certainly among basketball fans.
p276
aVHe's the only person ever to make the basketball Hall of Fame
p277
aVboth as a player and as a coach.
p278
aVAnd what he told his entering team \u2014
p279
aVhe led UCLA to an unprecedented number of victories and finals in the NCAA \u2014
p280
aVand what he used to tell any new team is he never spoke about winning.
p281
aVHe always said, "When it's over and you look in the mirror,
p282
aVdid you do the best that you were capable of?
p283
aVAnd if you did the best that you were capable of,
p284
aVthe score doesn't matter.
p285
aVBut I would suspect that if you did the best that you were capable of,
p286
aVyou will find the score to your liking."
p287
aVThat is investing in a process.
p288
aa(lp289
VWhat we do is the exact opposite.
p290
aVWe invest in the outcome.
p291
aVThis is what I want \u2014 oh, I want it so desperately,
p292
aVbecause if I get it I will be happy.
p293
aVAnd you try with might and main, to do whatever you can,
p294
aVbut you are always focusing on, "This is the outcome."
p295
aVNow, focusing on the outcome is fine.
p296
aVIt gives you direction.
p297
aVInvesting in the outcome means
p298
aVthat you make the achievement of a particular outcome
p299
aVdependent for your well-being.
p300
aVAnd that is a surefire recipe for failure.
p301
aa(lp302
VWhat you can do is something else.
p303
aVYou can invest in the process.
p304
aVThat is, once you have determined, here is where I am,
p305
aVhere is where I want to be, and that's fine,
p306
aVyou focus on the outcome only to the extent that it gives you direction,
p307
aVand then you invest yourself completely in the process.
p308
aVYou say, here are the steps you want to take,
p309
aVand you put everything into it.
p310
aVAnd if you succeed, wonderful.
p311
aVAnd if you don't succeed,
p312
aVstill wonderful,
p313
aVbecause now you have a new starting point, and from that new starting point,
p314
aVyou select another outcome and keep going.
p315
aVAnd when you do that, you will find that every day is a blast.
p316
aa(lp317
VLet me give you an example.
p318
aVAnd if you have children \u2014 raise your hands if you have children.
p319
aVHave you ever seen a small child learn to walk?
p320
aVWhat happens, and this happens typically between 11 and 13 months,
p321
aVis the child gets up and she sees everybody walking,
p322
aVshe wants to walk, she gets up, she falls down, she starts crying
p323
aVand momma runs up and comforts her, kisses the place, makes it well.
p324
aVShe tries again, falls down, mommy runs up again.
p325
aVAfter some time, mommy feels tired and no longer runs up
p326
aVand the child stops crying,
p327
aVand then she gets up, takes a step
p328
aVand doesn't fall down, and then she takes another,
p329
aVand a beautiful smile comes on her face.
p330
aVAnd very soon, generally within 24 hours, she's walking all over the place,
p331
aVupsetting your living room arrangements.
p332
aVAnd you know you've gone to a new stage of parenting.
p333
aVRight?
p334
aa(lp335
VNow, imagine what would happen
p336
aVif each time the child fell,
p337
aVshe would say, "Oh my God, I failed again.
p338
aVI'm never going to learn to walk."
p339
aVAnd you have to get counseling for her
p340
aVto help her deal with feelings of inadequacy
p341
aVand not being able to achieve and fail yet again.
p342
aVHow long do you think it would take her to learn to walk if you had to do that,
p343
aVif every three times she fell down, you had to get a counselor
p344
aVto counsel her and so on?
p345
aVSounds funny, doesn't it?
p346
aVBut that is exactly what we're doing.
p347
aVWhat the child is doing is focusing on the process.
p348
aVShe's investing in the process,
p349
aVnot in the outcome.
p350
aa(lp351
VWhat we do is the exact opposite.
p352
aVAs we grow up, we lose the ability to invest in the process,
p353
aVwe start investing in the outcome.
p354
aVBy definition the outcome is outside of our control,
p355
aVand if that's where we spend all of our emotional energy,
p356
aVwe are going to get drained as we do.
p357
aa(lp358
VBut if, on the other hand, we said,
p359
aV"Here is the outcome, I am going to invest in the process
p360
aVand give it every single bit I could,"
p361
aVevery day is a blast,
p362
aVand you're well on your way to achieving the vision that I outlined to you.
p363
aa(lp364
VThe question that I get all the time, is people say, "Professor Rao,
p365
aVbut nothing makes me passionate."
p366
aVSo I say, "OK, what would?"
p367
aVAnd they invariably come up with, you know, here is a list of things.
p368
aVHere's my job and here's how much it pays,
p369
aVthis is the kind of person my boss is,
p370
aVthe kind of people my colleagues are,
p371
aVand here's how my customers are, here's how much I travel,
p372
aVhere's how big my office is, how deep the carpeting is,
p373
aVhow many windows I have \u2014
p374
aVa bunch of parameters.
p375
aa(lp376
VAnd what I tell them is what I want to share with you,
p377
aVbecause all of that stuff \u2014 first of all, it doesn't exist.
p378
aVBut second, even if it did and you were plugged into it,
p379
aVit would not take more than six months
p380
aVfor you to be the same sorry, miserable self there as you are now,
p381
aVbecause passion exists inside you.
p382
aVIt does not exist in the job.
p383
aVAnd if you don't find a way to ignite it within you
p384
aVright where you are,
p385
aVyou are not going to find it outside.
p386
aVBut if you do find a way to ignite it where you are,
p387
aVthen you will find that the external world
p388
aVrearranges itself
p389
aVto accommodate the new person that you are becoming.
p390
aVAnd as you do that, you will find that miracles happen on a regular basis.
p391
aVPersons come up whom you're delighted to meet.
p392
aVNew people enter your life.
p393
aVIt's just a breeze,
p394
aVbecause all you do in your life is you take journeys.
p395
aa(lp396
VYou came here to this conference; you went on a journey.
p397
aVYou hang around the water cooler,
p398
aVtalking about how terrible your place of work is;
p399
aVyou went on a journey.
p400
aVYou watch "Desperate Housewives," you go on a journey.
p401
aVYou go on a journey
p402
aVwhere 40-something women are having affairs with 19-something gardeners
p403
aVwhile the husbands are playing around with models.
p404
aVAll you do is go on journeys.
p405
aVThere's nothing wrong with that, but just ask yourself,
p406
aV"Is this a journey I want to take?
p407
aVDoes this take me to a place I want to spend time?"
p408
aa(lp409
VAnd if you start doing that,
p410
aVyou will find that your life changes.
p411
aVThe kind of people you meet, the things you talk about,
p412
aVthe movies you go to, the books you read \u2014
p413
aVeverything changes.
p414
aVAnd you begin all of that
p415
aVby focusing on the process.
p416
aa(lp417
VInvest in the process, not in the outcome.
p418
aa(lp419
VThank you.
