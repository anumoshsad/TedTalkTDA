VGood evening.
p4
aVMy journey to this stage
p5
aVbegan when I came to America
p6
aVat the age of 17.
p7
aVYou see, I'm one of the 84 million Americans
p8
aVwho are immigrants
p9
aVor children of immigrants.
p10
aVEach of us has a dream when we come here,
p11
aVa dream that usually has to be rewritten
p12
aVand always has to be repurposed.
p13
aVI was one of the lucky ones.
p14
aVMy revised dream led me to the work I do today:
p15
aVtraining immigrants to run for public office
p16
aVand leading a movement for inclusive democracy.
p17
aa(lp18
VBut I don't want you to think it was a cakewalk,
p19
aVthat America opened its arms wide and welcomed me.
p20
aVIt's still not doing that.
p21
aVAnd I've learned a few lessons along the way
p22
aVthat I wanted to share with you,
p23
aVbecause I think that together
p24
aVwe can make American democracy
p25
aVbetter and stronger.
p26
aa(lp27
VI was born in India,
p28
aVthe world's largest democracy,
p29
aVand when I was four,
p30
aVmy family moved to Belize,
p31
aVthe world's smallest democracy perhaps.
p32
aVAnd at the age of 17,
p33
aVI moved to the United States,
p34
aVthe world's greatest democracy.
p35
aVI came because I wanted to study English literature.
p36
aVYou see, as a child, I buried my nose in books,
p37
aVand I thought, why not make a living doing that as an adult?
p38
aVBut after I graduated from college
p39
aVand got a graduate degree,
p40
aVI found myself moving from one less ideal job to another.
p41
aVMaybe it was the optimism that I had about America
p42
aVthat made me take a while to understand
p43
aVthat things were not going to change.
p44
aVThe door that I thought was open
p45
aVwas actually just slightly ajar \u2014
p46
aVthis door of America
p47
aVthat would open wide if you had the right name,
p48
aVthe right skin color,
p49
aVthe right networks,
p50
aVbut could just slam in your face
p51
aVif you had the wrong religion,
p52
aVthe wrong immigration status,
p53
aVthe wrong skin color.
p54
aVAnd I just couldn't accept that.
p55
aa(lp56
VSo I started a career as a social entrepreneur,
p57
aVstarting an organization for young people like myself \u2014
p58
aVI was young at the time that I started it \u2014
p59
aVwho traced their heritage to the Indian subcontinent.
p60
aVIn that work, I became and advocate for South Asians and other immigrants.
p61
aVI lobbied members of Congress on policy issues.
p62
aVI volunteered on election day to do exit polling.
p63
aVBut I couldn't vote, and I couldn't run for office.
p64
aVSo in 2000, when it was announced
p65
aVthat the citizenship application fee was going to more than double
p66
aVfrom 95 dollars to 225 dollars,
p67
aVI decided it was time to apply before I could no longer afford it.
p68
aVI filled out a long application,
p69
aVanswering questions about my current and my past affiliations.
p70
aVAnd once the application was submitted,
p71
aVthere were fingerprints to be taken,
p72
aVa test to study for,
p73
aVendless hours of waiting in line.
p74
aVYou might call it extreme vetting.
p75
aVAnd then in December of 2000,
p76
aVI joined hundreds of other immigrants
p77
aVin a hall in Brooklyn
p78
aVwhere we pledged our loyalty
p79
aVto a country that we had long considered home.
p80
aVMy journey from international student to American citizen took 16 years,
p81
aVa short timeline when you compare it to other immigrant stories.
p82
aa(lp83
VAnd soon after I had taken that formal step
p84
aVto becoming an American,
p85
aVthe attacks of September 11, 2001,
p86
aVchanged the immigration landscape for decades to come.
p87
aVMy city, New York City,
p88
aVwas reeling and healing,
p89
aVand in the midst of it,
p90
aVwe were in an election cycle.
p91
aa(lp92
VTwo things happened
p93
aVas we coped with loss and recovery in New York City.
p94
aVVoters elected Michael Bloomberg mayor of New York City.
p95
aVWe also adopted by ballot referendum
p96
aVthe Office of Immigrant Affairs for the City of New York.
p97
aVFive months after that election,
p98
aVthe newly elected mayor
p99
aVappointed me the first Commissioner of Immigrant Affairs
p100
aVfor this newly established office.
p101
aa(lp102
VI want you to come back to that time.
p103
aVI was a young immigrant woman from Belize.
p104
aVI had basically floundered in various jobs in America
p105
aVbefore I started a community-based organization
p106
aVin a church basement in Queens.
p107
aVThe attacks of September 11 sent shock waves through my community.
p108
aVPeople who were members of my family, young people I had worked with,
p109
aVwere experiencing harassment
p110
aVat schools, at workplaces and in airports.
p111
aVAnd now I was going to represent their concerns
p112
aVin government.
p113
aVNo job felt more perfect for me.
p114
aa(lp115
VAnd here are two things I learned when I became Commissioner.
p116
aVFirst, well-meaning New Yorkers
p117
aVwho were in city government holding government positions
p118
aVhad no idea how scared immigrants were
p119
aVof law enforcement.
p120
aVMost of us don't really know the difference, do we,
p121
aVbetween a sheriff and local police and the FBI.
p122
aVAnd most of us, when we see someone in uniform
p123
aVgoing through our neighborhoods
p124
aVfeel curiosity, if not concern.
p125
aVSo if you're an undocumented parent,
p126
aVevery day when you say goodbye to your child,
p127
aVsend them off to school and go to work,
p128
aVyou don't know what the chances are
p129
aVthat you're going to see them at the end of the day.
p130
aVBecause a raid at your workplace,
p131
aVa chance encounter with local police
p132
aVcould change the course of your life forever.
p133
aa(lp134
VThe second thing I learned is that when people like me,
p135
aVwho understood that fear,
p136
aVwho had learned a new language, who had navigated new systems,
p137
aVwhen people like us were sitting at the table,
p138
aVwe advocated for our communities' needs in a way that no one else could or would.
p139
aVI understood what that feeling of fear was like.
p140
aVPeople in my family were experiencing it.
p141
aVYoung people I had worked with were being harassed,
p142
aVnot just by classmates,
p143
aVbut also by their teachers.
p144
aVMy husband, then boyfriend,
p145
aVthought twice before he put a backpack on or grew a beard
p146
aVbecause he traveled so much.
p147
aa(lp148
VWhat I learned in 2001 was that my vote mattered
p149
aVbut that my voice and vantage point also mattered.
p150
aVAnd it's these three things \u2014
p151
aVimmigrants' votes, voices and vantage points \u2014
p152
aVthat I think can help make our democracy stronger.
p153
aVWe actually have the power
p154
aVto change the outcome of elections,
p155
aVto introduce new issues into the policy debate
p156
aVand to change the face of the pale, male, stale leadership
p157
aVthat we have in our country today.
p158
aa(lp159
VSo how do we do that?
p160
aVWell, let's talk first about votes.
p161
aVIt will come as no surprise to you
p162
aVthat the majority of voters in America are white.
p163
aVBut it might surprise you to know
p164
aVthat one in three voters are black, Latino or Asian.
p165
aVBut here's the thing:
p166
aVit doesn't just matter who can vote, it matters who does vote.
p167
aVSo in 2012, half of the Latino and Asian-American voters
p168
aVdid not vote.
p169
aa(lp170
VAnd these votes matter not just in presidential elections.
p171
aVThey matter in local and state elections.
p172
aVIn 2015, Lan Diep,
p173
aVthe eldest son of political refugees from Vietnam,
p174
aVran for a seat in the San Jose City Council.
p175
aVHe lost that election by 13 votes.
p176
aVThis year, he dusted off those campaign shoes
p177
aVand went back to run for that seat,
p178
aVand this time he won, by 12 votes.
p179
aVEvery one of our votes matters.
p180
aa(lp181
VAnd when people like Lan are sitting at the policy table,
p182
aVthey can make a difference.
p183
aVWe need those voices.
p184
aVWe need those voices
p185
aVin part because American leadership
p186
aVdoes not look like America's residents.
p187
aVThere are over 500,000 local and state offices in America.
p188
aVFewer than 2 percent of those offices are held by Asian-Americans or Latinos,
p189
aVthe two largest immigrant groups in our country.
p190
aVIn the city of Yakima, Washington,
p191
aVwhere 49 percent of the population is Latino,
p192
aVthere has never been a Latino on the city council until this year.
p193
aVThree newly elected Latinas joined the Yakima City Council in 2016.
p194
aVOne of them is Carmen Méndez.
p195
aVShe is a first-generation college student.
p196
aVShe grew up partly in Colima, Mexico,
p197
aVand partly in Yakima, Washington.
p198
aVShe's a single mother, a community advocate.
p199
aVHer voice on the Yakima City Council
p200
aVis advocating on behalf of the Latino community
p201
aVand of all Yakima residents.
p202
aVAnd she's a role model for her daughter
p203
aVand other Latinas.
p204
aa(lp205
VBut the third most untapped resource in American democracy
p206
aVis the vantage point that immigrants bring.
p207
aVWe have fought to be here.
p208
aVWe have come for economic and educational opportunity.
p209
aVWe have come for political and religious freedom.
p210
aVWe have come in the pursuit of love.
p211
aVThat dedication,
p212
aVthat commitment to America
p213
aVwe also bring to public service.
p214
aVPeople like Athena Salman,
p215
aVwho just last week won the primary
p216
aVfor a seat in the Arizona State House.
p217
aVAthena's father grew up in the West Bank
p218
aVand moved to Chicago,
p219
aVwhere he met her mother.
p220
aVHer mother is part Italian,
p221
aVpart Mexican and part German.
p222
aVTogether they moved to Arizona and built a life.
p223
aVAthena, when she gets to the statehouse,
p224
aVis going to fight for things like education funding
p225
aVthat will help give families like hers a leg up
p226
aVso they can achieve the financial stability
p227
aVthat we all are looking for.
p228
aa(lp229
VImmigrants' votes, voices and vantage points
p230
aVare what we all need to work to include in American democracy.
p231
aVIt's not just my work. It's also yours.
p232
aVAnd it's not going to be easy.
p233
aVWe never know
p234
aVwhat putting a new factor into an equation will do.
p235
aVAnd it's a little scary.
p236
aVYou're scared that I'm going to take away your place at the table,
p237
aVand I'm scared that I'm never going to get a place at the table.
p238
aVAnd we're all scared
p239
aVthat we're going to lose this country that we know and love.
p240
aVI'm scared you're going to take it away from me,
p241
aVand you're scared I'm going to take it away from you.
p242
aa(lp243
VLook, it's been a rough election year,
p244
aVa reminder that people with my immigration history
p245
aVcould be removed at the whim of a leader.
p246
aVBut I have fought to be in this country
p247
aVand I continue to do so every day.
p248
aVSo my optimism never wavers,
p249
aVbecause I know that there are millions of immigrants just like me,
p250
aVin front of me, behind me and all around me.
p251
aVIt's our country, too.
p252
aa(lp253
VThank you.
