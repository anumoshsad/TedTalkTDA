VThe universe
p4
aVis really big.
p5
aVWe live in a galaxy, the Milky Way Galaxy.
p6
aVThere are about a hundred billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy.
p7
aVAnd if you take a camera
p8
aVand you point it at a random part of the sky,
p9
aVand you just keep the shutter open,
p10
aVas long as your camera is attached to the Hubble Space Telescope,
p11
aVit will see something like this.
p12
aVEvery one of these little blobs
p13
aVis a galaxy roughly the size of our Milky Way \u2014
p14
aVa hundred billion stars in each of those blobs.
p15
aVThere are approximately a hundred billion galaxies
p16
aVin the observable universe.
p17
aV100 billion is the only number you need to know.
p18
aVThe age of the universe, between now and the Big Bang,
p19
aVis a hundred billion in dog years.
p20
aV(Laughter)
p21
aVWhich tells you something about our place in the universe.
p22
aa(lp23
VOne thing you can do with a picture like this is simply admire it.
p24
aVIt's extremely beautiful.
p25
aVI've often wondered, what is the evolutionary pressure
p26
aVthat made our ancestors in the Veldt adapt and evolve
p27
aVto really enjoy pictures of galaxies
p28
aVwhen they didn't have any.
p29
aVBut we would also like to understand it.
p30
aVAs a cosmologist, I want to ask, why is the universe like this?
p31
aVOne big clue we have is that the universe is changing with time.
p32
aVIf you looked at one of these galaxies and measured its velocity,
p33
aVit would be moving away from you.
p34
aVAnd if you look at a galaxy even farther away,
p35
aVit would be moving away faster.
p36
aVSo we say the universe is expanding.
p37
aa(lp38
VWhat that means, of course, is that, in the past,
p39
aVthings were closer together.
p40
aVIn the past, the universe was more dense,
p41
aVand it was also hotter.
p42
aVIf you squeeze things together, the temperature goes up.
p43
aVThat kind of makes sense to us.
p44
aVThe thing that doesn't make sense to us as much
p45
aVis that the universe, at early times, near the Big Bang,
p46
aVwas also very, very smooth.
p47
aVYou might think that that's not a surprise.
p48
aVThe air in this room is very smooth.
p49
aVYou might say, "Well, maybe things just smoothed themselves out."
p50
aVBut the conditions near the Big Bang are very, very different
p51
aVthan the conditions of the air in this room.
p52
aVIn particular, things were a lot denser.
p53
aVThe gravitational pull of things
p54
aVwas a lot stronger near the Big Bang.
p55
aa(lp56
VWhat you have to think about
p57
aVis we have a universe with a hundred billion galaxies,
p58
aVa hundred billion stars each.
p59
aVAt early times, those hundred billion galaxies
p60
aVwere squeezed into a region about this big \u2014
p61
aVliterally \u2014 at early times.
p62
aVAnd you have to imagine doing that squeezing
p63
aVwithout any imperfections,
p64
aVwithout any little spots
p65
aVwhere there were a few more atoms than somewhere else.
p66
aVBecause if there had been, they would have collapsed under the gravitational pull
p67
aVinto a huge black hole.
p68
aVKeeping the universe very, very smooth at early times
p69
aVis not easy; it's a delicate arrangement.
p70
aVIt's a clue
p71
aVthat the early universe is not chosen randomly.
p72
aVThere is something that made it that way.
p73
aVWe would like to know what.
p74
aa(lp75
VSo part of our understanding of this was given to us by Ludwig Boltzmann,
p76
aVan Austrian physicist in the 19th century.
p77
aVAnd Boltzmann's contribution was that he helped us understand entropy.
p78
aVYou've heard of entropy.
p79
aVIt's the randomness, the disorder, the chaoticness of some systems.
p80
aVBoltzmann gave us a formula \u2014
p81
aVengraved on his tombstone now \u2014
p82
aVthat really quantifies what entropy is.
p83
aVAnd it's basically just saying
p84
aVthat entropy is the number of ways
p85
aVwe can rearrange the constituents of a system so that you don't notice,
p86
aVso that macroscopically it looks the same.
p87
aVIf you have the air in this room,
p88
aVyou don't notice each individual atom.
p89
aVA low entropy configuration
p90
aVis one in which there's only a few arrangements that look that way.
p91
aVA high entropy arrangement
p92
aVis one that there are many arrangements that look that way.
p93
aVThis is a crucially important insight
p94
aVbecause it helps us explain
p95
aVthe second law of thermodynamics \u2014
p96
aVthe law that says that entropy increases in the universe,
p97
aVor in some isolated bit of the universe.
p98
aa(lp99
VThe reason why entropy increases
p100
aVis simply because there are many more ways
p101
aVto be high entropy than to be low entropy.
p102
aVThat's a wonderful insight,
p103
aVbut it leaves something out.
p104
aVThis insight that entropy increases, by the way,
p105
aVis what's behind what we call the arrow of time,
p106
aVthe difference between the past and the future.
p107
aVEvery difference that there is
p108
aVbetween the past and the future
p109
aVis because entropy is increasing \u2014
p110
aVthe fact that you can remember the past, but not the future.
p111
aVThe fact that you are born, and then you live, and then you die,
p112
aValways in that order,
p113
aVthat's because entropy is increasing.
p114
aVBoltzmann explained that if you start with low entropy,
p115
aVit's very natural for it to increase
p116
aVbecause there's more ways to be high entropy.
p117
aVWhat he didn't explain
p118
aVwas why the entropy was ever low in the first place.
p119
aa(lp120
VThe fact that the entropy of the universe was low
p121
aVwas a reflection of the fact
p122
aVthat the early universe was very, very smooth.
p123
aVWe'd like to understand that.
p124
aVThat's our job as cosmologists.
p125
aVUnfortunately, it's actually not a problem
p126
aVthat we've been giving enough attention to.
p127
aVIt's not one of the first things people would say,
p128
aVif you asked a modern cosmologist,
p129
aV"What are the problems we're trying to address?"
p130
aVOne of the people who did understand that this was a problem
p131
aVwas Richard Feynman.
p132
aV50 years ago, he gave a series of a bunch of different lectures.
p133
aVHe gave the popular lectures
p134
aVthat became "The Character of Physical Law."
p135
aVHe gave lectures to Caltech undergrads
p136
aVthat became "The Feynman Lectures on Physics."
p137
aVHe gave lectures to Caltech graduate students
p138
aVthat became "The Feynman Lectures on Gravitation."
p139
aVIn every one of these books, every one of these sets of lectures,
p140
aVhe emphasized this puzzle:
p141
aVWhy did the early universe have such a small entropy?
p142
aa(lp143
VSo he says \u2014 I'm not going to do the accent \u2014
p144
aVhe says, "For some reason, the universe, at one time,
p145
aVhad a very low entropy for its energy content,
p146
aVand since then the entropy has increased.
p147
aVThe arrow of time cannot be completely understood
p148
aVuntil the mystery of the beginnings of the history of the universe
p149
aVare reduced still further
p150
aVfrom speculation to understanding."
p151
aVSo that's our job.
p152
aVWe want to know \u2014 this is 50 years ago, "Surely," you're thinking,
p153
aV"we've figured it out by now."
p154
aVIt's not true that we've figured it out by now.
p155
aa(lp156
VThe reason the problem has gotten worse,
p157
aVrather than better,
p158
aVis because in 1998
p159
aVwe learned something crucial about the universe that we didn't know before.
p160
aVWe learned that it's accelerating.
p161
aVThe universe is not only expanding.
p162
aVIf you look at the galaxy, it's moving away.
p163
aVIf you come back a billion years later and look at it again,
p164
aVit will be moving away faster.
p165
aVIndividual galaxies are speeding away from us faster and faster
p166
aVso we say the universe is accelerating.
p167
aVUnlike the low entropy of the early universe,
p168
aVeven though we don't know the answer for this,
p169
aVwe at least have a good theory that can explain it,
p170
aVif that theory is right,
p171
aVand that's the theory of dark energy.
p172
aVIt's just the idea that empty space itself has energy.
p173
aa(lp174
VIn every little cubic centimeter of space,
p175
aVwhether or not there's stuff,
p176
aVwhether or not there's particles, matter, radiation or whatever,
p177
aVthere's still energy, even in the space itself.
p178
aVAnd this energy, according to Einstein,
p179
aVexerts a push on the universe.
p180
aVIt is a perpetual impulse
p181
aVthat pushes galaxies apart from each other.
p182
aVBecause dark energy, unlike matter or radiation,
p183
aVdoes not dilute away as the universe expands.
p184
aVThe amount of energy in each cubic centimeter
p185
aVremains the same,
p186
aVeven as the universe gets bigger and bigger.
p187
aVThis has crucial implications
p188
aVfor what the universe is going to do in the future.
p189
aVFor one thing, the universe will expand forever.
p190
aa(lp191
VBack when I was your age,
p192
aVwe didn't know what the universe was going to do.
p193
aVSome people thought that the universe would recollapse in the future.
p194
aVEinstein was fond of this idea.
p195
aVBut if there's dark energy, and the dark energy does not go away,
p196
aVthe universe is just going to keep expanding forever and ever and ever.
p197
aV14 billion years in the past,
p198
aV100 billion dog years,
p199
aVbut an infinite number of years into the future.
p200
aVMeanwhile, for all intents and purposes,
p201
aVspace looks finite to us.
p202
aVSpace may be finite or infinite,
p203
aVbut because the universe is accelerating,
p204
aVthere are parts of it we cannot see
p205
aVand never will see.
p206
aVThere's a finite region of space that we have access to,
p207
aVsurrounded by a horizon.
p208
aVSo even though time goes on forever,
p209
aVspace is limited to us.
p210
aVFinally, empty space has a temperature.
p211
aa(lp212
VIn the 1970s, Stephen Hawking told us
p213
aVthat a black hole, even though you think it's black,
p214
aVit actually emits radiation
p215
aVwhen you take into account quantum mechanics.
p216
aVThe curvature of space-time around the black hole
p217
aVbrings to life the quantum mechanical fluctuation,
p218
aVand the black hole radiates.
p219
aVA precisely similar calculation by Hawking and Gary Gibbons
p220
aVshowed that if you have dark energy in empty space,
p221
aVthen the whole universe radiates.
p222
aVThe energy of empty space
p223
aVbrings to life quantum fluctuations.
p224
aVAnd so even though the universe will last forever,
p225
aVand ordinary matter and radiation will dilute away,
p226
aVthere will always be some radiation,
p227
aVsome thermal fluctuations,
p228
aVeven in empty space.
p229
aVSo what this means
p230
aVis that the universe is like a box of gas
p231
aVthat lasts forever.
p232
aVWell what is the implication of that?
p233
aa(lp234
VThat implication was studied by Boltzmann back in the 19th century.
p235
aVHe said, well, entropy increases
p236
aVbecause there are many, many more ways
p237
aVfor the universe to be high entropy, rather than low entropy.
p238
aVBut that's a probabilistic statement.
p239
aVIt will probably increase,
p240
aVand the probability is enormously huge.
p241
aVIt's not something you have to worry about \u2014
p242
aVthe air in this room all gathering over one part of the room and suffocating us.
p243
aVIt's very, very unlikely.
p244
aVExcept if they locked the doors
p245
aVand kept us here literally forever,
p246
aVthat would happen.
p247
aVEverything that is allowed,
p248
aVevery configuration that is allowed to be obtained by the molecules in this room,
p249
aVwould eventually be obtained.
p250
aa(lp251
VSo Boltzmann says, look, you could start with a universe
p252
aVthat was in thermal equilibrium.
p253
aVHe didn't know about the Big Bang. He didn't know about the expansion of the universe.
p254
aVHe thought that space and time were explained by Isaac Newton \u2014
p255
aVthey were absolute; they just stuck there forever.
p256
aVSo his idea of a natural universe
p257
aVwas one in which the air molecules were just spread out evenly everywhere \u2014
p258
aVthe everything molecules.
p259
aVBut if you're Boltzmann, you know that if you wait long enough,
p260
aVthe random fluctuations of those molecules
p261
aVwill occasionally bring them
p262
aVinto lower entropy configurations.
p263
aVAnd then, of course, in the natural course of things,
p264
aVthey will expand back.
p265
aVSo it's not that entropy must always increase \u2014
p266
aVyou can get fluctuations into lower entropy,
p267
aVmore organized situations.
p268
aa(lp269
VWell if that's true,
p270
aVBoltzmann then goes onto invent
p271
aVtwo very modern-sounding ideas \u2014
p272
aVthe multiverse and the anthropic principle.
p273
aVHe says, the problem with thermal equilibrium
p274
aVis that we can't live there.
p275
aVRemember, life itself depends on the arrow of time.
p276
aVWe would not be able to process information,
p277
aVmetabolize, walk and talk,
p278
aVif we lived in thermal equilibrium.
p279
aVSo if you imagine a very, very big universe,
p280
aVan infinitely big universe,
p281
aVwith randomly bumping into each other particles,
p282
aVthere will occasionally be small fluctuations in the lower entropy states,
p283
aVand then they relax back.
p284
aVBut there will also be large fluctuations.
p285
aVOccasionally, you will make a planet
p286
aVor a star or a galaxy
p287
aVor a hundred billion galaxies.
p288
aVSo Boltzmann says,
p289
aVwe will only live in the part of the multiverse,
p290
aVin the part of this infinitely big set of fluctuating particles,
p291
aVwhere life is possible.
p292
aVThat's the region where entropy is low.
p293
aVMaybe our universe is just one of those things
p294
aVthat happens from time to time.
p295
aa(lp296
VNow your homework assignment
p297
aVis to really think about this, to contemplate what it means.
p298
aVCarl Sagan once famously said
p299
aVthat "in order to make an apple pie,
p300
aVyou must first invent the universe."
p301
aVBut he was not right.
p302
aVIn Boltzmann's scenario, if you want to make an apple pie,
p303
aVyou just wait for the random motion of atoms
p304
aVto make you an apple pie.
p305
aVThat will happen much more frequently
p306
aVthan the random motions of atoms
p307
aVmaking you an apple orchard
p308
aVand some sugar and an oven,
p309
aVand then making you an apple pie.
p310
aVSo this scenario makes predictions.
p311
aVAnd the predictions are
p312
aVthat the fluctuations that make us are minimal.
p313
aVEven if you imagine that this room we are in now
p314
aVexists and is real and here we are,
p315
aVand we have, not only our memories,
p316
aVbut our impression that outside there's something
p317
aVcalled Caltech and the United States and the Milky Way Galaxy,
p318
aVit's much easier for all those impressions to randomly fluctuate into your brain
p319
aVthan for them actually to randomly fluctuate
p320
aVinto Caltech, the United States and the galaxy.
p321
aa(lp322
VThe good news is that,
p323
aVtherefore, this scenario does not work; it is not right.
p324
aVThis scenario predicts that we should be a minimal fluctuation.
p325
aVEven if you left our galaxy out,
p326
aVyou would not get a hundred billion other galaxies.
p327
aVAnd Feynman also understood this.
p328
aVFeynman says, "From the hypothesis that the world is a fluctuation,
p329
aVall the predictions are that
p330
aVif we look at a part of the world we've never seen before,
p331
aVwe will find it mixed up, and not like the piece we've just looked at \u2014
p332
aVhigh entropy.
p333
aVIf our order were due to a fluctuation,
p334
aVwe would not expect order anywhere but where we have just noticed it.
p335
aVWe therefore conclude the universe is not a fluctuation."
p336
aVSo that's good. The question is then what is the right answer?
p337
aVIf the universe is not a fluctuation,
p338
aVwhy did the early universe have a low entropy?
p339
aVAnd I would love to tell you the answer, but I'm running out of time.
p340
aa(lp341
V(Laughter)
p342
aa(lp343
VHere is the universe that we tell you about,
p344
aVversus the universe that really exists.
p345
aVI just showed you this picture.
p346
aVThe universe is expanding for the last 10 billion years or so.
p347
aVIt's cooling off.
p348
aVBut we now know enough about the future of the universe
p349
aVto say a lot more.
p350
aVIf the dark energy remains around,
p351
aVthe stars around us will use up their nuclear fuel, they will stop burning.
p352
aVThey will fall into black holes.
p353
aVWe will live in a universe
p354
aVwith nothing in it but black holes.
p355
aVThat universe will last 10 to the 100 years \u2014
p356
aVa lot longer than our little universe has lived.
p357
aVThe future is much longer than the past.
p358
aVBut even black holes don't last forever.
p359
aVThey will evaporate,
p360
aVand we will be left with nothing but empty space.
p361
aVThat empty space lasts essentially forever.
p362
aVHowever, you notice, since empty space gives off radiation,
p363
aVthere's actually thermal fluctuations,
p364
aVand it cycles around
p365
aVall the different possible combinations
p366
aVof the degrees of freedom that exist in empty space.
p367
aVSo even though the universe lasts forever,
p368
aVthere's only a finite number of things
p369
aVthat can possibly happen in the universe.
p370
aVThey all happen over a period of time
p371
aVequal to 10 to the 10 to the 120 years.
p372
aa(lp373
VSo here's two questions for you.
p374
aVNumber one: If the universe lasts for 10 to the 10 to the 120 years,
p375
aVwhy are we born
p376
aVin the first 14 billion years of it,
p377
aVin the warm, comfortable afterglow of the Big Bang?
p378
aVWhy aren't we in empty space?
p379
aVYou might say, "Well there's nothing there to be living,"
p380
aVbut that's not right.
p381
aVYou could be a random fluctuation out of the nothingness.
p382
aVWhy aren't you?
p383
aVMore homework assignment for you.
p384
aa(lp385
VSo like I said, I don't actually know the answer.
p386
aVI'm going to give you my favorite scenario.
p387
aVEither it's just like that. There is no explanation.
p388
aVThis is a brute fact about the universe
p389
aVthat you should learn to accept and stop asking questions.
p390
aVOr maybe the Big Bang
p391
aVis not the beginning of the universe.
p392
aVAn egg, an unbroken egg, is a low entropy configuration,
p393
aVand yet, when we open our refrigerator,
p394
aVwe do not go, "Hah, how surprising to find
p395
aVthis low entropy configuration in our refrigerator."
p396
aVThat's because an egg is not a closed system;
p397
aVit comes out of a chicken.
p398
aVMaybe the universe comes out of a universal chicken.
p399
aVMaybe there is something that naturally,
p400
aVthrough the growth of the laws of physics,
p401
aVgives rise to universe like ours
p402
aVin low entropy configurations.
p403
aVIf that's true, it would happen more than once;
p404
aVwe would be part of a much bigger multiverse.
p405
aVThat's my favorite scenario.
p406
aa(lp407
VSo the organizers asked me to end with a bold speculation.
p408
aVMy bold speculation
p409
aVis that I will be absolutely vindicated by history.
p410
aVAnd 50 years from now,
p411
aVall of my current wild ideas will be accepted as truths
p412
aVby the scientific and external communities.
p413
aVWe will all believe that our little universe
p414
aVis just a small part of a much larger multiverse.
p415
aVAnd even better, we will understand what happened at the Big Bang
p416
aVin terms of a theory
p417
aVthat we will be able to compare to observations.
p418
aVThis is a prediction. I might be wrong.
p419
aVBut we've been thinking as a human race
p420
aVabout what the universe was like,
p421
aVwhy it came to be in the way it did for many, many years.
p422
aVIt's exciting to think we may finally know the answer someday.
