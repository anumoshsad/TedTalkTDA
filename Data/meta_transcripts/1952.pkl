VChris Anderson: We had Edward Snowden here
p4
aVa couple days ago,
p5
aVand this is response time.
p6
aVAnd several of you have written to me
p7
aVwith questions to ask our guest here from the NSA.
p8
aVSo Richard Ledgett is the 15th deputy director
p9
aVof the National Security Agency,
p10
aVand he's a senior civilian officer there,
p11
aVacts as its chief operating officer,
p12
aVguiding strategies, setting internal policies,
p13
aVand serving as the principal advisor to the director.
p14
aVAnd all being well,
p15
aVwelcome, Rick Ledgett, to TED.
p16
aV(Applause)
p17
aa(lp18
VRichard Ledgett: I'm really thankful for the opportunity to talk to folks here.
p19
aVI look forward to the conversation,
p20
aVso thanks for arranging for that.
p21
aa(lp22
VCA: Thank you, Rick.
p23
aVWe appreciate you joining us.
p24
aVIt's certainly quite a strong statement
p25
aVthat the NSA is willing to reach out
p26
aVand show a more open face here.
p27
aVYou saw, I think,
p28
aVthe talk and interview that Edward Snowden
p29
aVgave here a couple days ago.
p30
aVWhat did you make of it?
p31
aVRL: So I think it was interesting.
p32
aVWe didn't realize that he  was going to show up there,
p33
aVso kudos to you guys for arranging
p34
aVa nice surprise like that.
p35
aVI think that, like a lot of the things
p36
aVthat have come out since Mr. Snowden
p37
aVstarted disclosing classified information,
p38
aVthere were some kernels of truth in there,
p39
aVbut a lot of extrapolations and half-truths in there,
p40
aVand I'm interested in helping to address those.
p41
aVI think this is a really important conversation
p42
aVthat we're having in the United States
p43
aVand internationally,
p44
aVand I think it is important and of import,
p45
aVand so given that, we need to have that be
p46
aVa fact-based conversation,
p47
aVand we want to help make that happen.
p48
aa(lp49
VCA: So the question that a lot  of people have here is,
p50
aVwhat do you make of Snowden's motivations
p51
aVfor doing what he did,
p52
aVand did he have an alternative way that he could have gone?
p53
aa(lp54
VRL: He absolutely did
p55
aVhave alternative ways that he could have gone,
p56
aVand I actually think that characterizing him
p57
aVas a whistleblower
p58
aVactually hurts legitimate whistleblowing activities.
p59
aVSo what if somebody who works in the NSA \u2014
p60
aVand there are over 35,000 people who do.
p61
aVThey're all great citizens.
p62
aVThey're just like your husbands, fathers, sisters,
p63
aVbrothers, neighbors, nephews, friends and relatives,
p64
aVall of whom are interested in doing the right thing
p65
aVfor their country
p66
aVand for our allies internationally,
p67
aVand so there are a variety of venues to address
p68
aVif folks have a concern.
p69
aVFirst off, there's their supervisor,
p70
aVand up through the supervisory chain
p71
aVwithin their organization.
p72
aVIf folks aren't comfortable with that,
p73
aVthere are a number of inspectors general.
p74
aVIn the case of Mr. Snowden, he had the option
p75
aVof the NSA inspector general,
p76
aVthe Navy inspector general,
p77
aVthe Pacific Command inspector general,
p78
aVthe Department of Defense inspector general,
p79
aVand the intelligence community inspector general,
p80
aVany of whom would have both kept his concerns in classified channels
p81
aVand been happy to address them.
p82
aV(CA and RL speaking at once)
p83
aVHe had the option to go to congressional committees,
p84
aVand there are mechanisms to do that that are in place,
p85
aVand so he didn't do any of those things.
p86
aa(lp87
VCA: Now, you had said that
p88
aVEd Snowden had other avenues
p89
aVfor raising his concerns.
p90
aVThe comeback on that is a couple of things:
p91
aVone, that he certainly believes that as a contractor,
p92
aVthe avenues that would have been available to him as an employee weren't available,
p93
aVtwo, there's a track record of other whistleblowers,
p94
aVlike [Thomas Andrews Drake] being treated
p95
aVpretty harshly, by some views,
p96
aVand thirdly, what he was taking on
p97
aVwas not one specific flaw that he'd discovered,
p98
aVbut programs that had been approved
p99
aVby all three branches of government.
p100
aVI mean, in that circumstance,
p101
aVcouldn't you argue that what he did
p102
aVwas reasonable?
p103
aa(lp104
VRL: No, I don't agree with that.
p105
aVI think that the \u2014
p106
aVsorry, I'm getting feedback
p107
aVthrough the microphone there \u2014
p108
aVthe actions that he took were inappropriate
p109
aVbecause of the fact that  he put people's lives at risk,
p110
aVbasically, in the long run,
p111
aVand I know there's been a lot of talk
p112
aVin public by Mr. Snowden and some of the journalists
p113
aVthat say that the things that have been disclosed
p114
aVhave not put national security and people at risk,
p115
aVand that is categorically not true.
p116
aVThey actually do.
p117
aVI think there's also an amazing arrogance
p118
aVto the idea that he knows better than
p119
aVthe framers of the Constitution
p120
aVin how the government should  be designed and work
p121
aVfor separation of powers
p122
aVand the fact that the executive  and the legislative branch
p123
aVhave to work together and they have checks and balances on each other,
p124
aVand then the judicial branch,
p125
aVwhich oversees the entire process.
p126
aVI think that's extremely arrogant on his part.
p127
aa(lp128
VCA: Can you give a specific example
p129
aVof how he put people's lives at risk?
p130
aa(lp131
VRL: Yeah, sure.
p132
aVSo the things that he's disclosed,
p133
aVthe capabilities,
p134
aVand the NSA is a capabilities-based organization,
p135
aVso when we have foreign intelligence targets,
p136
aVlegitimate things of interest \u2014
p137
aVlike, terrorists is the iconic example,
p138
aVbut it includes things like human traffickers,
p139
aVdrug traffickers,
p140
aVpeople who are trying to build advanced weaponry, nuclear weapons,
p141
aVand build delivery systems for those,
p142
aVand nation-states who might be executing aggression against their immediate neighbors,
p143
aVwhich you may have some visibility
p144
aVinto some of that that's going on right now,
p145
aVthe capabilities are applied
p146
aVin very discrete and measured and controlled ways.
p147
aVSo the unconstrained disclosure  of those capabilities
p148
aVmeans that as adversaries see them
p149
aVand recognize, "Hey, I might be vulnerable to this,"
p150
aVthey move away from that,
p151
aVand we have seen targets in terrorism,
p152
aVin the nation-state area,
p153
aVin smugglers of various types, and other folks
p154
aVwho have, because of the disclosures,
p155
aVmoved away from our ability
p156
aVto have insight into what they're doing.
p157
aVThe net effect of that is that our people
p158
aVwho are overseas in dangerous places,
p159
aVwhether they're diplomats or military,
p160
aVand our allies who are in similar situations,
p161
aVare at greater risk because we don't see
p162
aVthe threats that are coming their way.
p163
aa(lp164
VCA: So that's a general response saying that
p165
aVbecause of his revelations,
p166
aVaccess that you had to certain types of information
p167
aVhas been shut down, has been closed down.
p168
aVBut the concern is that the nature of that access
p169
aVwas not necessarily legitimate in the first place.
p170
aVI mean, describe to us this Bullrun program
p171
aVwhere it's alleged that the NSA
p172
aVspecifically weakened security
p173
aVin order to get the type of  access that you've spoken of.
p174
aa(lp175
VRL: So there are, when our
p176
aVlegitimate foreign intelligence targets of the type that I described before,
p177
aVuse the global telecommunications system
p178
aVas their communications methodology,
p179
aVand they do, because it's a great system,
p180
aVit's the most complex system ever devised by man,
p181
aVand it is a wonder,
p182
aVand lots of folks in the room there
p183
aVare responsible for the creation
p184
aVand enhancement of that,
p185
aVand it's just a wonderful thing.
p186
aVBut it's also used by people who are
p187
aVworking against us and our allies.
p188
aVAnd so if I'm going to pursue them,
p189
aVI need to have the capability
p190
aVto go after them,
p191
aVand again, the controls are in
p192
aVhow I apply that capability,
p193
aVnot that I have the capability itself.
p194
aVOtherwise, if we could make it so that
p195
aVall the bad guys used one corner of the Internet,
p196
aVwe could have a domain, badguy.com.
p197
aVThat would be awesome,
p198
aVand we could just concentrate all our efforts there.
p199
aVThat's not how it works.
p200
aVThey're trying to hide
p201
aVfrom the government's ability
p202
aVto isolate and interdict their actions,
p203
aVand so we have to swim in that same space.
p204
aVBut I will tell you this.
p205
aVSo NSA has two missions.
p206
aVOne is the Signals Intelligence mission
p207
aVthat we've unfortunately read so much about in the press.
p208
aVThe other one is the Information Assurance mission,
p209
aVwhich is to protect the national security systems of the United States,
p210
aVand by that, that's things like
p211
aVthe communications that the president uses,
p212
aVthe communications that control our nuclear weapons,
p213
aVthe communications that our military uses around the world,
p214
aVand the communications that we use with our allies,
p215
aVand that some of our allies themselves use.
p216
aVAnd so we make recommendations on standards to use,
p217
aVand we use those same standards,
p218
aVand so we are invested
p219
aVin making sure that those communications
p220
aVare secure for their intended purposes.
p221
aa(lp222
VCA: But it sounds like what you're saying is that
p223
aVwhen it comes to the Internet at large,
p224
aVany strategy is fair game
p225
aVif it improves America's safety.
p226
aVAnd I think this is partly where there is such
p227
aVa divide of opinion,
p228
aVthat there's a lot of people in this room
p229
aVand around the world
p230
aVwho think very differently about the Internet.
p231
aVThey think of it as a momentous
p232
aVinvention of humanity,
p233
aVkind of on a par with the Gutenberg press, for example.
p234
aVIt's the bringer of knowledge to all.
p235
aVIt's the connector of all.
p236
aVAnd it's viewed in those sort of idealistic terms.
p237
aVAnd from that lens,
p238
aVwhat the NSA has done is equivalent to
p239
aVthe authorities back in Germany
p240
aVinserting some device into every printing press
p241
aVthat would reveal which books people bought
p242
aVand what they read.
p243
aVCan you understand that from that viewpoint,
p244
aVit feels outrageous?
p245
aa(lp246
VRL: I do understand that, and I actually share the view of the utility of the Internet,
p247
aVand I would argue it's bigger than the Internet.
p248
aVIt is a global telecommunications system.
p249
aVThe Internet is a big chunk of  that, but there is a lot more.
p250
aVAnd I think that people have legitimate concerns
p251
aVabout the balance between transparency and secrecy.
p252
aVThat's sort of been couched as a balance
p253
aVbetween privacy and national security.
p254
aVI don't think that's the right framing.
p255
aVI think it really is transparency and secrecy.
p256
aVAnd so that's the national and international conversation that we're having,
p257
aVand we want to participate in that, and want
p258
aVpeople to participate in it in an informed way.
p259
aVSo there are things,
p260
aVlet me talk there a little bit more,
p261
aVthere are things that we need to be transparent about:
p262
aVour authorities, our processes,
p263
aVour oversight, who we are.
p264
aVWe, NSA, have not done a good job of that,
p265
aVand I think that's part of the reason
p266
aVthat this has been so revelational
p267
aVand so sensational in the media.
p268
aVNobody knew who we were. We were the No Such Agency, the Never Say Anything.
p269
aVThere's takeoffs of our logo
p270
aVof an eagle with headphones on around it.
p271
aVAnd so that's the public characterization.
p272
aVAnd so we need to be more transparent about those things.
p273
aVWhat we don't need to be transparent about,
p274
aVbecause it's bad for the U.S.,
p275
aVit's bad for all those other countries that we work with
p276
aVand that we help provide information
p277
aVthat helps them secure themselves
p278
aVand their people,
p279
aVit's bad to expose operations and capabilities
p280
aVin a way that allows the people that we're all working against,
p281
aVthe generally recognized bad guys,
p282
aVto counter those.
p283
aa(lp284
VCA: But isn't it also bad to deal
p285
aVa kind of body blow to the American companies
p286
aVthat have essentially given the world
p287
aVmost of the Internet services that matter?
p288
aVRL: It is. It's really the companies are
p289
aVin a tough position, as are we,
p290
aVbecause the companies,
p291
aVwe compel them to provide information,
p292
aVjust like every other nation in the world does.
p293
aVEvery industrialized nation in the world
p294
aVhas a lawful intercept program
p295
aVwhere they are requiring companies
p296
aVto provide them with information
p297
aVthat they need for their security,
p298
aVand the companies that are involved
p299
aVhave complied with those programs
p300
aVin the same way that they have to do
p301
aVwhen they're operating in Russia or the U.K.
p302
aVor China or India or France,
p303
aVany country that you choose to name.
p304
aVAnd so the fact that these revelations
p305
aVhave been broadly characterized as
p306
aV"you can't trust company A because
p307
aVyour privacy is suspect with them"
p308
aVis actually only accurate in the sense that
p309
aVit's accurate with every other company in the world
p310
aVthat deals with any of those countries in the world.
p311
aVAnd so it's being picked up by people
p312
aVas a marketing advantage,
p313
aVand it's being marketed that  way by several countries,
p314
aVincluding some of our allied countries,
p315
aVwhere they are saying,
p316
aV"Hey, you can't trust the U.S.,
p317
aVbut you can trust our telecom company,
p318
aVbecause we're safe."
p319
aVAnd they're actually using that to counter
p320
aVthe very large technological edge
p321
aVthat U.S. companies have
p322
aVin areas like the cloud and Internet-based technologies.
p323
aa(lp324
VCA: You're sitting there with the American flag,
p325
aVand the American Constitution guarantees
p326
aVfreedom from unreasonable search and seizure.
p327
aVHow do you characterize
p328
aVthe American citizen's right to privacy?
p329
aVIs there such a right?
p330
aa(lp331
VRL: Yeah, of course there is.
p332
aVAnd we devote an inordinate amount of time and pressure,
p333
aVinordinate and appropriate, actually I should say,
p334
aVamount of time and effort in order to ensure
p335
aVthat we protect that privacy.
p336
aVand beyond that, the privacy of citizens
p337
aVaround the world, it's not just Americans.
p338
aVSeveral things come into play here.
p339
aVFirst, we're all in the same network.
p340
aVMy communications,
p341
aVI'm a user of a particular Internet email service
p342
aVthat is the number one email service of choice
p343
aVby terrorists around the world, number one.
p344
aVSo I'm there right beside them in email space
p345
aVin the Internet.
p346
aVAnd so we need to be able to pick that apart
p347
aVand find the information that's relevant.
p348
aVIn doing so, we're going to necessarily encounter
p349
aVAmericans and innocent foreign citizens
p350
aVwho are just going about their business,
p351
aVand so we have procedures in place that shreds that out,
p352
aVthat says, when you find that,
p353
aVnot if you find it, when you find it, because you're certain to find it,
p354
aVhere's how you protect that.
p355
aVThese are called minimization procedures.
p356
aVThey're approved by the attorney general
p357
aVand constitutionally based.
p358
aVAnd so we protect those.
p359
aVAnd then, for people, citizens of the world
p360
aVwho are going about their lawful business
p361
aVon a day-to-day basis,
p362
aVthe president on his January 17 speech,
p363
aVlaid out some additional protections
p364
aVthat we are providing to them.
p365
aVSo I think absolutely,
p366
aVfolks do have a right to privacy,
p367
aVand that we work very hard to make sure
p368
aVthat that right to privacy is protected.
p369
aa(lp370
VCA: What about foreigners using
p371
aVAmerican companies' Internet services?
p372
aVDo they have any privacy rights?
p373
aa(lp374
VRL: They do. They do, in the sense of,
p375
aVthe only way that we are able to compel
p376
aVone of those companies to provide us information
p377
aVis when it falls into one of three categories:
p378
aVWe can identify that this particular person,
p379
aVidentified by a selector of some kind,
p380
aVis associated with counterterrorist
p381
aVor proliferation or other foreign intelligence target.
p382
aa(lp383
VCA: Much has been made of the fact that
p384
aVa lot of the information that you've obtained
p385
aVthrough these programs is essentially metadata.
p386
aVIt's not necessarily the actual words
p387
aVthat someone has written in an email
p388
aVor given on a phone call.
p389
aVIt's who they wrote to and when, and so forth.
p390
aVBut it's been argued,
p391
aVand someone here in the audience has talked
p392
aVto a former NSA analyst who said
p393
aVmetadata is actually much more invasive
p394
aVthan the core data,
p395
aVbecause in the core data
p396
aVyou present yourself as you want to be presented.
p397
aVWith metadata, who knows what the conclusions are
p398
aVthat are drawn?
p399
aVIs there anything to that?
p400
aa(lp401
VRL: I don't really understand that argument.
p402
aVI think that metadata's important for a couple of reasons.
p403
aVMetadata is the information that lets you
p404
aVfind connections that people are trying to hide.
p405
aVSo when a terrorist is corresponding
p406
aVwith somebody else who's not known to us
p407
aVbut is engaged in doing or supporting terrorist activity,
p408
aVor someone who's violating international sanctions
p409
aVby providing nuclear weapons-related material
p410
aVto a country like Iran or North Korea,
p411
aVis trying to hide that activity because it's illicit activity.
p412
aVWhat metadata lets you do is connect that.
p413
aVThe alternative to that
p414
aVis one that's much less efficient
p415
aVand much more invasive of privacy,
p416
aVwhich is gigantic amounts of content collection.
p417
aVSo metadata, in that sense,
p418
aVactually is privacy-enhancing.
p419
aVAnd we don't, contrary to some of the stuff
p420
aVthat's been printed,
p421
aVwe don't sit there and grind out
p422
aVmetadata profiles of average people.
p423
aVIf you're not connected
p424
aVto one of those valid intelligence targets,
p425
aVyou are not of interest to us.
p426
aa(lp427
VCA: So in terms of the threats
p428
aVthat face America overall,
p429
aVwhere would you place terrorism?
p430
aa(lp431
VRL: I think terrorism is still number one.
p432
aVI think that we have never been in a time
p433
aVwhere there are more places
p434
aVwhere things are going badly
p435
aVand forming the petri dish in which terrorists
p436
aVtake advantage of the lack of governance.
p437
aVAn old boss of mine, Tom Fargo, Admiral Fargo,
p438
aVused to describe it as arcs of instability.
p439
aVAnd so you have a lot of those arcs of instability
p440
aVin the world right now,
p441
aVin places like Syria, where there's a civil war
p442
aVgoing on and you have massive numbers,
p443
aVthousands and thousands of foreign fighters
p444
aVwho are coming into Syria
p445
aVto learn how to be terrorists
p446
aVand practice that activity,
p447
aVand lots of those people are Westerners
p448
aVwho hold passports to European countries
p449
aVor in some cases the United States,
p450
aVand so they are basically learning how
p451
aVto do jihad and have expressed intent
p452
aVto go out and do that later on
p453
aVin their home countries.
p454
aVYou've got places like Iraq,
p455
aVwhich is suffering from a high level of sectarian violence,
p456
aVagain a breeding ground for terrorism.
p457
aVAnd you have the activity in the Horn of Africa
p458
aVand the Sahel area of Africa.
p459
aVAgain, lots of weak governance
p460
aVwhich forms a breeding ground for terrorist activity.
p461
aVSo I think it's very serious. I think it's number one.
p462
aVI think number two is cyber threat.
p463
aVI think cyber is a threat in three ways:
p464
aVOne way, and probably the most common way
p465
aVthat people have heard about it,
p466
aVis due to the theft of intellectual property,
p467
aVso basically, foreign countries going in,
p468
aVstealing companies' secrets,
p469
aVand then providing that information
p470
aVto state-owned enterprises
p471
aVor companies connected to the government
p472
aVto help them leapfrog technology
p473
aVor to gain business intelligence
p474
aVthat's then used to win contracts overseas.
p475
aVThat is a hugely costly set of activities that's going on right now.
p476
aVSeveral nation-states are doing it.
p477
aVSecond is the denial-of-service attacks.
p478
aVYou're probably aware that there have been
p479
aVa spate of those directed against
p480
aVthe U.S. financial sector since 2012.
p481
aVAgain, that's a nation-state who is executing those attacks,
p482
aVand they're doing that
p483
aVas a semi-anonymous way of reprisal.
p484
aVAnd the last one is destructive attacks,
p485
aVand those are the ones that concern me the most.
p486
aVThose are on the rise.
p487
aVYou have the attack against Saudi Aramco in 2012,
p488
aVAugust of 2012.
p489
aVIt took down about 35,000 of their computers
p490
aVwith a Wiper-style virus.
p491
aVYou had a follow-on a week later
p492
aVto a Qatari company.
p493
aVYou had March of 2013,
p494
aVyou had a South Korean attack
p495
aVthat was attributed in the press to North Korea
p496
aVthat took out thousands of computers.
p497
aVThose are on the rise,
p498
aVand we see people expressing interest
p499
aVin those capabilities
p500
aVand a desire to employ them.
p501
aa(lp502
VCA: Okay, so a couple of things here,
p503
aVbecause this is really the core of this, almost.
p504
aVI mean, first of all,
p505
aVa lot of people who look at risk
p506
aVand look at the numbers
p507
aVdon't understand this belief that terrorism
p508
aVis still the number one threat.
p509
aVApart from September 11,
p510
aVI think the numbers are that in the last 30 or 40 years
p511
aVabout 500 Americans have died from terrorism,
p512
aVmostly from homegrown terrorists.
p513
aVThe chance in the last few years
p514
aVof being killed by terrorism
p515
aVis far less than the chance of being killed by lightning.
p516
aVI guess you would say that a single nuclear incident
p517
aVor bioterrorism act or something like that
p518
aVwould change those numbers.
p519
aVWould that be the point of view?
p520
aa(lp521
VRL: Well, I'd say two things.
p522
aVOne is, the reason that there hasn't been
p523
aVa major attack in the United States since 9/11,
p524
aVthat is not an accident.
p525
aVThat's a lot of hard work that we have done,
p526
aVthat other folks
p527
aVin the intelligence community have done,
p528
aVthat the military has done,
p529
aVand that our allies around the globe have done.
p530
aVYou've heard the numbers about
p531
aVthe tip of the iceberg in terms
p532
aVof numbers of terrorist attacks that NSA programs
p533
aVcontributed to stopping was 54,
p534
aV25 of those in Europe,
p535
aVand of those 25,
p536
aV18 of them occurred in three countries,
p537
aVsome of which are our allies,
p538
aVand some of which are beating the heck out of us
p539
aVover the NSA programs, by the way.
p540
aVSo that's not an accident that those things happen.
p541
aVThat's hard work. That's us finding intelligence
p542
aVon terrorist activities
p543
aVand interdicting them through one way or another,
p544
aVthrough law enforcement,
p545
aVthrough cooperative activities with other countries
p546
aVand sometimes through military action.
p547
aVThe other thing I would say is that
p548
aVyour idea of nuclear or chem-bio-threat
p549
aVis not at all far-fetched
p550
aVand in fact there are a number of groups
p551
aVwho have for several years expressed interest
p552
aVand desire in obtaining those capabilities
p553
aVand work towards that.
p554
aa(lp555
VCA: It's also been said that,
p556
aVof those 54 alleged incidents,
p557
aVthat as few as zero of them
p558
aVwere actually anything to do
p559
aVwith these controversial programs
p560
aVthat Mr. Snowden revealed,
p561
aVthat it was basically through other forms of intelligence,
p562
aVthat you're looking for a needle in a haystack,
p563
aVand the effects of these programs,
p564
aVthese controversial programs,
p565
aVis just to add hay to the stack,
p566
aVnot to really find the needle.
p567
aVThe needle was found by other methods.
p568
aVIsn't there something to that?
p569
aa(lp570
VRL: No, there's actually two programs
p571
aVthat are typically implicated in that discussion.
p572
aVOne is the section 215 program,
p573
aVthe U.S. telephony metadata program,
p574
aVand the other one is
p575
aVpopularly called the PRISM program,
p576
aVand it's actually section 702  of the FISA Amendment Act.
p577
aVBut the 215 program
p578
aVis only relevant to threats
p579
aVthat are directed against the United States,
p580
aVand there have been a dozen threats
p581
aVwhere that was implicated.
p582
aVNow what you'll see people say publicly
p583
aVis there is no "but for" case,
p584
aVand so there is no case where, but for that,
p585
aVthe threat would have happened.
p586
aVBut that actually indicates a lack of understanding
p587
aVof how terrorist investigations actually work.
p588
aVYou think about on television,
p589
aVyou watch a murder mystery.
p590
aVWhat do you start with? You start with a body,
p591
aVand then they work their way from there to solve the crime.
p592
aVWe're actually starting well before that,
p593
aVhopefully before there are any bodies,
p594
aVand we're trying to build the case for
p595
aVwho the people are, what they're trying to do,
p596
aVand that involves massive amounts of information.
p597
aVThink of it is as mosaic,
p598
aVand it's hard to say that any one piece of a mosaic
p599
aVwas necessary to building the mosaic,
p600
aVbut to build the complete picture,
p601
aVyou need to have all the pieces of information.
p602
aVOn the other, the non-U.S.-related threats out of those 54,
p603
aVthe other 42 of them,
p604
aVthe PRISM program was hugely relevant to that,
p605
aVand in fact was material in contributing
p606
aVto stopping those attacks.
p607
aa(lp608
VCA: Snowden said two days ago
p609
aVthat terrorism has always been
p610
aVwhat is called in the intelligence world
p611
aV"a cover for action,"
p612
aVthat it's something that,
p613
aVbecause it invokes such a powerful
p614
aVemotional response in people,
p615
aVit allows the initiation of these programs
p616
aVto achieve powers that an organization like yours
p617
aVcouldn't otherwise have.
p618
aVIs there any internal debate about that?
p619
aa(lp620
VRL: Yeah.
p621
aVI mean, we debate these things all the time,
p622
aVand there is discussion that goes on
p623
aVin the executive branch
p624
aVand within NSA itself
p625
aVand the intelligence community about
p626
aVwhat's right, what's proportionate,
p627
aVwhat's the correct thing to do.
p628
aVAnd it's important to note that the programs
p629
aVthat we're talking about
p630
aVwere all authorized by two different presidents,
p631
aVtwo different political parties,
p632
aVby Congress twice,
p633
aVand by federal judges 16 different times,
p634
aVand so this is not NSA running off
p635
aVand doing its own thing.
p636
aVThis is a legitimate activity
p637
aVof the United States foreign government
p638
aVthat was agreed to by all the branches
p639
aVof the United States government,
p640
aVand President Madison would have been proud.
p641
aa(lp642
VCA: And yet, when congressmen discovered
p643
aVwhat was actually being done  with that authorization,
p644
aVmany of them were completely shocked.
p645
aVOr do you think that is not a legitimate reaction,
p646
aVthat it's only because it's now come out publicly,
p647
aVthat they really knew exactly what you were doing
p648
aVwith the powers they had granted you?
p649
aa(lp650
VRL: Congress is a big body.
p651
aVThere's 535 of them,
p652
aVand they change out frequently,
p653
aVin the case of the House, every two years,
p654
aVand I think that the NSA provided
p655
aVall the relevant information to our oversight committees,
p656
aVand then the dissemination of that information
p657
aVby the oversight committees throughout Congress
p658
aVis something that they manage.
p659
aVI think I would say that Congress members
p660
aVhad the opportunity to make themselves aware,
p661
aVand in fact a significant number of them,
p662
aVthe ones who are assigned oversight responsibility,
p663
aVdid have the ability to do that.
p664
aVAnd you've actually had the chairs of those committees say that in public.
p665
aVCA: Now, you mentioned the  threat of cyberattacks,
p666
aVand I don't think anyone in this room would disagree
p667
aVthat that is a huge concern,
p668
aVbut do you accept that there's a tradeoff
p669
aVbetween offensive and defensive strategies,
p670
aVand that it's possible that the very measures taken
p671
aVto, "weaken encryption,"
p672
aVand allow yourself to find the bad guys,
p673
aVmight also open the door to forms of cyberattack?
p674
aa(lp675
VRL: So I think two things.
p676
aVOne is, you said weaken encryption. I didn't.
p677
aVAnd the other one is that
p678
aVthe NSA has both of those missions,
p679
aVand we are heavily biased towards defense,
p680
aVand, actually, the vulnerabilities that we find
p681
aVin the overwhelming majority of cases,
p682
aVwe disclose to the people who are responsible
p683
aVfor manufacturing or developing those products.
p684
aVWe have a great track record of that,
p685
aVand we're actually working on a proposal right now
p686
aVto be transparent and to publish transparency reports
p687
aVin the same way that the Internet companies
p688
aVare being allowed to publish transparency reports for them.
p689
aVWe want to be more transparent about that.
p690
aVSo again, we eat our own dog food.
p691
aVWe use the standards, we use the products
p692
aVthat we recommend,
p693
aVand so it's in our interest
p694
aVto keep our communications protected
p695
aVin the same way that other people's need to be.
p696
aa(lp697
VCA: Edward Snowden,
p698
aVwhen, after his talk, was wandering the halls here
p699
aVin the bot,
p700
aVand I heard him say to a couple of people,
p701
aVthey asked him about what he thought
p702
aVof the NSA overall,
p703
aVand he was very complimentary about the people
p704
aVwho work with you,
p705
aVsaid that it's a really
p706
aVimpassioned group of employees
p707
aVwho are seeking to do the right thing,
p708
aVand that the problems have come from
p709
aVjust some badly conceived policies.
p710
aVHe came over certainly very reasonably and calmly.
p711
aVHe didn't come over like a crazy man.
p712
aVWould you accept that at least,
p713
aVeven if you disagree with how he did it,
p714
aVthat he has opened a debate that matters?
p715
aa(lp716
VRL: So I think that the discussion
p717
aVis an important one to have.
p718
aVI do not like the way that he did it.
p719
aVI think there were a number of other ways
p720
aVthat he could have done that
p721
aVthat would have not endangered our people
p722
aVand the people of other nations
p723
aVthrough losing visibility
p724
aVinto what our adversaries are doing.
p725
aVBut I do think it's an important conversation.
p726
aa(lp727
VCA: It's been reported that there's
p728
aValmost a difference of opinion
p729
aVwith you and your colleagues
p730
aVover any scenario in which
p731
aVhe might be offered an amnesty deal.
p732
aVI think your boss, General Keith Alexander,
p733
aVhas said that that would be a terrible example
p734
aVfor others;
p735
aVyou can't negotiate with someone
p736
aVwho's broken the law in that way.
p737
aVBut you've been quoted as saying that,
p738
aVif Snowden could prove that he was surrendering
p739
aVall undisclosed documents,
p740
aVthat a deal maybe should be considered.
p741
aVDo you still think that?
p742
aa(lp743
VRL: Yeah, so actually,
p744
aVthis is my favorite thing about that "60 Minutes" interview
p745
aVwas all the misquotes that came from that.
p746
aVWhat I actually said, in  response to a question about,
p747
aVwould you entertain any discussions
p748
aVof mitigating action against Snowden,
p749
aVI said, yeah, it's worth a conversation.
p750
aVThis is something that the attorney general
p751
aVof the United States and the president also
p752
aVactually have both talked about this,
p753
aVand I defer to the attorney general,
p754
aVbecause this is his lane.
p755
aVBut there is a strong tradition
p756
aVin American jurisprudence
p757
aVof having discussions with people
p758
aVwho have been charged with crimes in order to,
p759
aVif it benefits the government,
p760
aVto get something out of that,
p761
aVthat there's always room for that kind of discussion.
p762
aVSo I'm not presupposing any outcome,
p763
aVbut there is always room for discussion.
p764
aa(lp765
VCA: To a lay person it seems like
p766
aVhe has certain things to offer the U.S.,
p767
aVthe government, you, others,
p768
aVin terms of putting things right
p769
aVand helping figure out a smarter policy,
p770
aVa smarter way forward for the future.
p771
aVDo you see, has that kind of possibility
p772
aVbeen entertained at all?
p773
aVRL: So that's out of my lane.
p774
aVThat's not an NSA thing.
p775
aVThat would be a Department of Justice
p776
aVsort of discussion.
p777
aVI'll defer to them.
p778
aa(lp779
VCA: Rick, when Ed Snowden ended his talk,
p780
aVI offered him the chance to share an idea worth spreading.
p781
aVWhat would be your idea worth spreading
p782
aVfor this group?
p783
aa(lp784
VRL: So I think, learn the facts.
p785
aVThis is a really important conversation,
p786
aVand it impacts, it's not just NSA,
p787
aVit's not just the government,
p788
aVit's you, it's the Internet companies.
p789
aVThe issue of privacy and personal data
p790
aVis much bigger than just the government,
p791
aVand so learn the facts.
p792
aVDon't rely on headlines,
p793
aVdon't rely on sound bites,
p794
aVdon't rely on one-sided conversations.
p795
aVSo that's the idea, I think, worth spreading.
p796
aVWe have a sign, a badge tab,
p797
aVwe wear badges at work with lanyards,
p798
aVand if I could make a plug,
p799
aVmy badge lanyard at work says, "Dallas Cowboys."
p800
aVGo Dallas.
p801
aVI've just alienated half the audience, I know.
p802
aVSo the lanyard that our people
p803
aVwho work in the organization
p804
aVthat does our crypto-analytic work
p805
aVhave a tab that says, "Look at the data."
p806
aVSo that's the idea worth spreading.
p807
aVLook at the data.
p808
aa(lp809
VCA: Rick, it took a certain amount of courage,
p810
aVI think, actually, to come and speak openly
p811
aVto this group.
p812
aVIt's not something the NSA has done a lot of in the past,
p813
aVand plus the technology has been challenging.
p814
aVWe truly appreciate you doing that
p815
aVand sharing in this very important conversation.
p816
aVThank you so much.
p817
