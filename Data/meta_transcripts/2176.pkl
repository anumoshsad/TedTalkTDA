VSo recently, we heard a lot about how social media helps empower protest,
p4
aVand that's true,
p5
aVbut after more than a decade
p6
aVof studying and participating in multiple social movements,
p7
aVI've come to realize
p8
aVthat the way technology empowers social movements
p9
aVcan also paradoxically help weaken them.
p10
aVThis is not inevitable, but overcoming it requires diving deep
p11
aVinto what makes success possible over the long term.
p12
aVAnd the lessons apply in multiple domains.
p13
aa(lp14
VNow, take Turkey's Gezi Park protests, July 2013,
p15
aVwhich I went back to study in the field.
p16
aVTwitter was key to its organizing.
p17
aVIt was everywhere in the park \u2014 well, along with a lot of tear gas.
p18
aVIt wasn't all high tech.
p19
aVBut the people in Turkey had already gotten used to the power of Twitter
p20
aVbecause of an unfortunate incident about a year before
p21
aVwhen military jets had bombed and killed
p22
aV34 Kurdish smugglers near the border region,
p23
aVand Turkish media completely censored this news.
p24
aVEditors sat in their newsrooms
p25
aVand waited for the government to tell them what to do.
p26
aVOne frustrated journalist could not take this anymore.
p27
aVHe purchased his own plane ticket,
p28
aVand went to the village where this had occurred.
p29
aVAnd he was confronted by this scene:
p30
aVa line of coffins coming down a hill, relatives wailing.
p31
aVHe later he told me how overwhelmed he felt,
p32
aVand didn't know what to do,
p33
aVso he took out his phone,
p34
aVlike any one of us might,
p35
aVand snapped that picture and tweeted it out.
p36
aVAnd voila, that picture went viral
p37
aVand broke the censorship and forced mass media to cover it.
p38
aa(lp39
VSo when, a year later, Turkey's Gezi protests happened,
p40
aVit started as a protest about a park being razed,
p41
aVbut became an anti-authoritarian protest.
p42
aVIt wasn't surprising that media also censored it,
p43
aVbut it got a little ridiculous at times.
p44
aVWhen things were so intense,
p45
aVwhen CNN International was broadcasting live from Istanbul,
p46
aVCNN Turkey instead was broadcasting a documentary on penguins.
p47
aVNow, I love penguin documentaries, but that wasn't the news of the day.
p48
aVAn angry viewer put his two screens together and snapped that picture,
p49
aVand that one too went viral,
p50
aVand since then, people call Turkish media the penguin media. (Laughter)
p51
aa(lp52
VBut this time, people knew what to do.
p53
aVThey just took out their phones and looked for actual news.
p54
aVBetter, they knew to go to the park and take pictures and participate
p55
aVand share it more on social media.
p56
aVDigital connectivity was used for everything from food to donations.
p57
aVEverything was organized partially with the help of these new technologies.
p58
aa(lp59
VAnd using Internet to mobilize and publicize protests
p60
aVactually goes back a long way.
p61
aVRemember the Zapatistas,
p62
aVthe peasant uprising in the southern Chiapas region of Mexico
p63
aVled by the masked, pipe-smoking, charismatic Subcomandante Marcos?
p64
aVThat was probably the first movement
p65
aVthat got global attention thanks to the Internet.
p66
aVOr consider Seattle '99,
p67
aVwhen a multinational grassroots effort brought global attention
p68
aVto what was then an obscure organization, the World Trade Organization,
p69
aVby also utilizing these digital technologies to help them organize.
p70
aVAnd more recently, movement after movement
p71
aVhas shaken country after country:
p72
aVthe Arab uprisings from Bahrain to Tunisia to Egypt and more;
p73
aVindignados in Spain, Italy, Greece; the Gezi Park protests;
p74
aVTaiwan; Euromaidan in Ukraine; Hong Kong.
p75
aVAnd think of more recent initiatives, like the #BringBackOurGirls hashtags.
p76
aVNowadays, a network of tweets can unleash a global awareness campaign.
p77
aVA Facebook page can become the hub of a massive mobilization.
p78
aVAmazing.
p79
aa(lp80
VBut think of the moments I just mentioned.
p81
aVThe achievements they were able to have, their outcomes,
p82
aVare not really proportional to the size and energy they inspired.
p83
aVThe hopes they rightfully raised are not really matched
p84
aVby what they were able to have as a result in the end.
p85
aVAnd this raises a question:
p86
aVAs digital technology makes things easier for movements,
p87
aVwhy haven't successful outcomes become more likely as well?
p88
aVIn embracing digital platforms for activism and politics,
p89
aVare we overlooking some of the benefits of doing things the hard way?
p90
aVNow, I believe so.
p91
aVI believe that the rule of thumb is:
p92
aVEasier to mobilize does not always mean easier to achieve gains.
p93
aa(lp94
VNow, to be clear,
p95
aVtechnology does empower in multiple ways.
p96
aVIt's very powerful.
p97
aVIn Turkey, I watched four young college students
p98
aVorganize a countrywide citizen journalism network called 140Journos
p99
aVthat became the central hub for uncensored news in the country.
p100
aVIn Egypt, I saw another four young people use digital connectivity
p101
aVto organize the supplies and logistics for 10 field hospitals,
p102
aVvery large operations,
p103
aVduring massive clashes near Tahrir Square in 2011.
p104
aVAnd I asked the founder of this effort, called Tahrir Supplies,
p105
aVhow long it took him to go from when he had the idea to when he got started.
p106
aV"Five minutes," he said. Five minutes.
p107
aVAnd he had no training or background in logistics.
p108
aVOr think of the Occupy movement which rocked the world in 2011.
p109
aVIt started with a single email
p110
aVfrom a magazine, Adbusters, to 90,000 subscribers in its list.
p111
aVAbout two months after that first email,
p112
aVthere were in the United States 600 ongoing occupations and protests.
p113
aVLess than one month after the first physical occupation in Zuccotti Park,
p114
aVa global protest was held in about 82 countries, 950 cities.
p115
aVIt was one of the largest global protests ever organized.
p116
aa(lp117
VNow, compare that to what the Civil Rights Movement had to do in 1955 Alabama
p118
aVto protest the racially segregated bus system, which they wanted to boycott.
p119
aVThey'd been preparing for many years
p120
aVand decided it was time to swing into action
p121
aVafter Rosa Parks was arrested.
p122
aVBut how do you get the word out \u2014
p123
aVtomorrow we're going to start the boycott \u2014
p124
aVwhen you don't have Facebook, texting, Twitter, none of that?
p125
aVSo they had to mimeograph 52,000 leaflets
p126
aVby sneaking into a university duplicating room
p127
aVand working all night, secretly.
p128
aVThey then used the 68 African-American organizations
p129
aVthat criss-crossed the city to distribute those leaflets by hand.
p130
aVAnd the logistical tasks were daunting, because these were poor people.
p131
aVThey had to get to work, boycott or no,
p132
aVso a massive carpool was organized,
p133
aVagain by meeting.
p134
aVNo texting, no Twitter, no Facebook.
p135
aVThey had to meet almost all the time to keep this carpool going.
p136
aa(lp137
VToday, it would be so much easier.
p138
aVWe could create a database, available rides and what rides you need,
p139
aVhave the database coordinate, and use texting.
p140
aVWe wouldn't have to meet all that much.
p141
aVBut again, consider this:
p142
aVthe Civil Rights Movement in the United States
p143
aVnavigated a minefield of political dangers,
p144
aVfaced repression and overcame, won major policy concessions,
p145
aVnavigated and innovated through risks.
p146
aVIn contrast, three years after Occupy sparked
p147
aVthat global conversation about inequality,
p148
aVthe policies that fueled it are still in place.
p149
aVEurope was also rocked by anti-austerity protests,
p150
aVbut the continent didn't shift its direction.
p151
aVIn embracing these technologies,
p152
aVare we overlooking some of the benefits of slow and sustained?
p153
aVTo understand this,
p154
aVI went back to Turkey about a year after the Gezi protests
p155
aVand I interviewed a range of people,
p156
aVfrom activists to politicians,
p157
aVfrom both the ruling party and the opposition party and movements.
p158
aVI found that the Gezi protesters were despairing.
p159
aVThey were frustrated,
p160
aVand they had achieved much less than what they had hoped for.
p161
aVThis echoed what I'd been hearing around the world
p162
aVfrom many other protesters that I'm in touch with.
p163
aVAnd I've come to realize that part of the problem
p164
aVis that today's protests have become a bit like climbing Mt. Everest
p165
aVwith the help of 60 Sherpas,
p166
aVand the Internet is our Sherpa.
p167
aVWhat we're doing is taking the fast routes
p168
aVand not replacing the benefits of the slower work.
p169
aVBecause, you see,
p170
aVthe kind of work that went into organizing
p171
aVall those daunting, tedious logistical tasks
p172
aVdid not just take care of those tasks,
p173
aVthey also created the kind of organization that could think together collectively
p174
aVand make hard decisions together,
p175
aVcreate consensus and innovate, and maybe even more crucially,
p176
aVkeep going together through differences.
p177
aVSo when you see this March on Washington in 1963,
p178
aVwhen you look at that picture,
p179
aVwhere this is the march where Martin Luther King gave his famous
p180
aV"I have a dream" speech, 1963,
p181
aVyou don't just see a march and you don't just hear a powerful speech,
p182
aVyou also see the painstaking, long-term work that can put on that march.
p183
aVAnd if you're in power,
p184
aVyou realize you have to take the capacity signaled by that march,
p185
aVnot just the march, but the capacity signaled by that march, seriously.
p186
aVIn contrast, when you look at Occupy's global marches
p187
aVthat were organized in two weeks,
p188
aVyou see a lot of discontent,
p189
aVbut you don't necessarily see teeth that can bite over the long term.
p190
aVAnd crucially, the Civil Rights Movement innovated tactically
p191
aVfrom boycotts to lunch counter sit-ins to pickets to marches to freedom rides.
p192
aVToday's movements scale up very quickly without the organizational base
p193
aVthat can see them through the challenges.
p194
aVThey feel a little like startups that got very big
p195
aVwithout knowing what to do next,
p196
aVand they rarely manage to shift tactically
p197
aVbecause they don't have the depth of capacity
p198
aVto weather such transitions.
p199
aa(lp200
VNow, I want to be clear: The magic is not in the mimeograph.
p201
aVIt's in that capacity to work together, think together collectively,
p202
aVwhich can only be built over time with a lot of work.
p203
aVTo understand all this,
p204
aVI interviewed a top official from the ruling party in Turkey,
p205
aVand I ask him, "How do you do it?"
p206
aVThey too use digital technology extensively, so that's not it.
p207
aVSo what's the secret?
p208
aVWell, he told me.
p209
aVHe said the key is he never took sugar with his tea.
p210
aVI said, what has that got to do with anything?
p211
aVWell, he said, his party starts getting ready for the next election
p212
aVthe day after the last one,
p213
aVand he spends all day every day meeting with voters in their homes,
p214
aVin their wedding parties, circumcision ceremonies,
p215
aVand then he meets with his colleagues to compare notes.
p216
aVWith that many meetings every day, with tea offered at every one of them,
p217
aVwhich he could not refuse, because that would be rude,
p218
aVhe could not take even one cube of sugar per cup of tea,
p219
aVbecause that would be many kilos of sugar, he can't even calculate how many kilos,
p220
aVand at that point I realized why he was speaking so fast.
p221
aVWe had met in the afternoon, and he was already way over-caffeinated.
p222
aVBut his party won two major elections
p223
aVwithin a year of the Gezi protests with comfortable margins.
p224
aVTo be sure, governments have different resources to bring to the table.
p225
aVIt's not the same game, but the differences are instructive.
p226
aVAnd like all such stories, this is not a story just of technology.
p227
aVIt's what technology allows us to do converging with what we want to do.
p228
aVToday's social movements want to operate informally.
p229
aVThey do not want institutional leadership.
p230
aVThey want to stay out of politics because they fear corruption and cooptation.
p231
aVThey have a point.
p232
aVModern representative democracies are being strangled in many countries
p233
aVby powerful interests.
p234
aVBut operating this way makes it hard for them
p235
aVto sustain over the long term and exert leverage over the system,
p236
aVwhich leads to frustrated protesters dropping out,
p237
aVand even more corrupt politics.
p238
aVAnd politics and democracy without an effective challenge hobbles,
p239
aVbecause the causes that have inspired the modern recent movements are crucial.
p240
aVClimate change is barreling towards us.
p241
aVInequality is stifling human growth and potential and economies.
p242
aVAuthoritarianism is choking many countries.
p243
aVWe need movements to be more effective.
p244
aa(lp245
VNow, some people have argued that the problem is
p246
aVtoday's movements are not formed of people who take as many risks as before,
p247
aVand that is not true.
p248
aVFrom Gezi to Tahrir to elsewhere,
p249
aVI've seen people put their lives and livelihoods on the line.
p250
aVIt's also not true, as Malcolm Gladwell claimed,
p251
aVthat today's protesters form weaker virtual ties.
p252
aVNo, they come to these protests, just like before,
p253
aVwith their friends, existing networks,
p254
aVand sometimes they do make new friends for life.
p255
aVI still see the friends that I made
p256
aVin those Zapatista-convened global protests more than a decade ago,
p257
aVand the bonds between strangers are not worthless.
p258
aVWhen I got tear-gassed in Gezi,
p259
aVpeople I didn't know helped me and one another instead of running away.
p260
aVIn Tahrir, I saw people, protesters,
p261
aVworking really hard to keep each other safe and protected.
p262
aVAnd digital awareness-raising is great,
p263
aVbecause changing minds is the bedrock of changing politics.
p264
aVBut movements today have to move beyond participation at great scale very fast
p265
aVand figure out how to think together collectively,
p266
aVdevelop strong policy proposals, create consensus,
p267
aVfigure out the political steps and relate them to leverage,
p268
aVbecause all these good intentions and bravery and sacrifice by itself
p269
aVare not going to be enough.
p270
aa(lp271
VAnd there are many efforts.
p272
aVIn New Zealand, a group of young people are developing a platform called Loomio
p273
aVfor participatory decision making at scale.
p274
aVIn Turkey, 140Journos are holding hack-a-thons
p275
aVso that they support communities as well as citizen journalism.
p276
aVIn Argentina, an open-source platform called DemocracyOS
p277
aVis bringing participation to parliaments and political parties.
p278
aVThese are all great, and we need more,
p279
aVbut the answer won't just be better online decision-making,
p280
aVbecause to update democracy, we are going to need to innovate at every level,
p281
aVfrom the organizational to the political to the social.
p282
aVBecause to succeed over the long term,
p283
aVsometimes you do need tea without sugar
p284
aValong with your Twitter.
p285
aVThank you.
