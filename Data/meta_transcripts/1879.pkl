VWhat is so special about the human brain?
p4
aVWhy is it that we study other animals
p5
aVinstead of them studying us?
p6
aVWhat does a human brain have or do
p7
aVthat no other brain does?
p8
aVWhen I became interested in these questions about 10 years ago,
p9
aVscientists thought they knew what different brains were made of.
p10
aVThough it was based on very little evidence,
p11
aVmany scientists thought that all mammalian brains,
p12
aVincluding the human brain,
p13
aVwere made in the same way,
p14
aVwith a number of neurons that was always
p15
aVproportional to the size of the brain.
p16
aVThis means that two brains of the same size,
p17
aVlike these two, with a respectable 400 grams,
p18
aVshould have similar numbers of neurons.
p19
aVNow, if neurons are the functional
p20
aVinformation processing units of the brain,
p21
aVthen the owners of these two brains
p22
aVshould have similar cognitive abilities.
p23
aVAnd yet, one is a chimp,
p24
aVand the other is a cow.
p25
aVNow maybe cows have a really rich
p26
aVinternal mental life and are so smart
p27
aVthat they choose not to let us realize it,
p28
aVbut we eat them.
p29
aVI think most people will agree
p30
aVthat chimps are capable of much more complex,
p31
aVelaborate and flexible behaviors than cows are.
p32
aVSo this is a first indication that the
p33
aV"all brains are made the same way" scenario
p34
aVis not quite right.
p35
aa(lp36
VBut let's play along.
p37
aVIf all brains were made the same way
p38
aVand you were to compare animals with brains of different sizes,
p39
aVlarger brains should always have more neurons
p40
aVthan smaller brains, and the larger the brain,
p41
aVthe more cognitively able its owner should be.
p42
aVSo the largest brain around should also be
p43
aVthe most cognitively able.
p44
aVAnd here comes the bad news:
p45
aVOur brain, not the largest one around.
p46
aVIt seems quite vexing.
p47
aVOur brain weighs between 1.2 and 1.5 kilos,
p48
aVbut elephant brains weigh between four and five kilos,
p49
aVand whale brains can weigh up to nine kilos,
p50
aVwhich is why scientists used to resort to saying
p51
aVthat our brain must be special
p52
aVto explain our cognitive abilities.
p53
aVIt must be really extraordinary,
p54
aVan exception to the rule.
p55
aVTheirs may be bigger, but ours is better,
p56
aVand it could be better, for example,
p57
aVin that it seems larger than it should be,
p58
aVwith a much larger cerebral cortex than we should have
p59
aVfor the size of our bodies.
p60
aVSo that would give us extra cortex
p61
aVto do more interesting things than just operating the body.
p62
aVThat's because the size of the brain
p63
aVusually follows the size of the body.
p64
aVSo the main reason for saying that
p65
aVour brain is larger than it should be
p66
aVactually comes from comparing ourselves
p67
aVto great apes.
p68
aVGorillas can be two to three times larger than we are,
p69
aVso their brains should also be larger than ours,
p70
aVbut instead it's the other way around.
p71
aVOur brain is three times larger than a gorilla brain.
p72
aa(lp73
VThe human brain also seems special
p74
aVin the amount of energy that it uses.
p75
aVAlthough it weighs only two percent of the body,
p76
aVit alone uses 25 percent of all the energy
p77
aVthat your body requires to run per day.
p78
aVThat's 500 calories out of a total of 2,000 calories,
p79
aVjust to keep your brain working.
p80
aa(lp81
VSo the human brain is larger than it should be,
p82
aVit uses much more energy than it should,
p83
aVso it's special.
p84
aVAnd this is where the story started to bother me.
p85
aVIn biology, we look for rules
p86
aVthat apply to all animals and to life in general,
p87
aVso why should the rules of evolution
p88
aVapply to everybody else but not to us?
p89
aVMaybe the problem was with the basic assumption
p90
aVthat all brains are made in the same way.
p91
aVMaybe two brains of a similar size
p92
aVcan actually be made of very different numbers of neurons.
p93
aVMaybe a very large brain
p94
aVdoes not necessarily have more neurons
p95
aVthan a more modest-sized brain.
p96
aVMaybe the human brain  actually has the most neurons
p97
aVof any brain, regardless of its size,
p98
aVespecially in the cerebral cortex.
p99
aVSo this to me became
p100
aVthe important question to answer:
p101
aVhow many neurons does the human brain have,
p102
aVand how does that compare to other animals?
p103
aa(lp104
VNow, you may have heard or read somewhere
p105
aVthat we have 100 billion neurons,
p106
aVso 10 years ago, I asked my colleagues
p107
aVif they knew where this number came from.
p108
aVBut nobody did.
p109
aVI've been digging through the literature
p110
aVfor the original reference for that number,
p111
aVand I could never find it.
p112
aVIt seems that nobody had actually ever counted
p113
aVthe number of neurons in the human brain,
p114
aVor in any other brain for that matter.
p115
aa(lp116
VSo I came up with my own way to count cells in the brain,
p117
aVand it essentially consists of
p118
aVdissolving that brain into soup.
p119
aVIt works like this:
p120
aVYou take a brain, or parts of that brain,
p121
aVand you dissolve it in detergent,
p122
aVwhich destroys the cell membranes
p123
aVbut keeps the cell nuclei intact,
p124
aVso you end up with a suspension of free nuclei
p125
aVthat looks like this,
p126
aVlike a clear soup.
p127
aVThis soup contains all the nuclei
p128
aVthat once were a mouse brain.
p129
aVNow, the beauty of a soup is that because it is soup,
p130
aVyou can agitate it and make those nuclei
p131
aVbe distributed homogeneously in the liquid,
p132
aVso that now by looking under the microscope
p133
aVat just four or five samples of this homogeneous solution,
p134
aVyou can count nuclei, and therefore tell
p135
aVhow many cells that brain had.
p136
aVIt's simple, it's straightforward,
p137
aVand it's really fast.
p138
aVSo we've used that method to count neurons
p139
aVin dozens of different species so far,
p140
aVand it turns out that all brains
p141
aVare not made the same way.
p142
aVTake rodents and primates, for instance:
p143
aVIn larger rodent brains, the average size
p144
aVof the neuron increases,
p145
aVso the brain inflates very rapidly
p146
aVand gains size much faster than it gains neurons.
p147
aVBut primate brains gain neurons
p148
aVwithout the average neuron becoming any larger,
p149
aVwhich is a very economical way
p150
aVto add neurons to your brain.
p151
aVThe result is that a primate brain
p152
aVwill always have more neurons than a rodent brain of the same size,
p153
aVand the larger the brain,
p154
aVthe larger this difference will be.
p155
aVWell, what about our brain then?
p156
aVWe found that we have, on average,
p157
aV86 billion neurons,
p158
aV16 billion of which are in the cerebral cortex,
p159
aVand if you consider that the cerebral cortex
p160
aVis the seat of functions like
p161
aVawareness and logical and abstract reasoning,
p162
aVand that 16 billion is the most neurons
p163
aVthat any cortex has,
p164
aVI think this is the simplest explanation
p165
aVfor our remarkable cognitive abilities.
p166
aVBut just as important is what the 86 billion neurons mean.
p167
aVBecause we found that the relationship
p168
aVbetween the size of the brain and its number of neurons
p169
aVcould be described mathematically,
p170
aVwe could calculate what a human brain
p171
aVwould look like if it was made like a rodent brain.
p172
aVSo, a rodent brain with 86 billion neurons
p173
aVwould weigh 36 kilos.
p174
aVThat's not possible.
p175
aVA brain that huge would be crushed
p176
aVby its own weight,
p177
aVand this impossible brain would go
p178
aVin the body of 89 tons.
p179
aVI don't think it looks like us.
p180
aa(lp181
VSo this brings us to a very important conclusion already,
p182
aVwhich is that we are not rodents.
p183
aVThe human brain is not a large rat brain.
p184
aVCompared to a rat, we might seem special, yes,
p185
aVbut that's not a fair comparison to make,
p186
aVgiven that we know that we are not rodents.
p187
aVWe are primates,
p188
aVso the correct comparison is to other primates.
p189
aVAnd there, if you do the math,
p190
aVyou find that a generic primate
p191
aVwith 86 billion neurons
p192
aVwould have a brain of about 1.2 kilos,
p193
aVwhich seems just right,
p194
aVin a body of some 66 kilos,
p195
aVwhich in my case is exactly right,
p196
aVwhich brings us to a very unsurprising
p197
aVbut still incredibly important conclusion:
p198
aVI am a primate.
p199
aVAnd all of you are primates.
p200
aa(lp201
VAnd so was Darwin.
p202
aVI love to think that Darwin would have really appreciated this.
p203
aVHis brain, like ours,
p204
aVwas made in the image of other primate brains.
p205
aa(lp206
VSo the human brain may be remarkable, yes,
p207
aVbut it is not special in its number of neurons.
p208
aVIt is just a large primate brain.
p209
aVI think that's a very humbling and sobering thought
p210
aVthat should remind us of our place in nature.
p211
aa(lp212
VWhy does it cost so much energy, then?
p213
aVWell, other people have figured out
p214
aVhow much energy the human brain
p215
aVand that of other species costs,
p216
aVand now that we knew how many neurons
p217
aVeach brain was made of, we could do the math.
p218
aVAnd it turns out that both human
p219
aVand other brains cost about the same,
p220
aVan average of six calories  per billion neurons per day.
p221
aVSo the total energetic cost of a brain
p222
aVis a simple, linear function
p223
aVof its number of neurons,
p224
aVand it turns out that the human brain
p225
aVcosts just as much energy as you would expect.
p226
aVSo the reason why the human brain
p227
aVcosts so much energy is simply because
p228
aVit has a huge number of neurons,
p229
aVand because we are primates
p230
aVwith many more neurons for a given body size
p231
aVthan any other animal,
p232
aVthe relative cost of our brain is large,
p233
aVbut just because we're primates, not because we're special.
p234
aa(lp235
VLast question, then:
p236
aVhow did we come by this remarkable number of neurons,
p237
aVand in particular, if great apes
p238
aVare larger than we are,
p239
aVwhy don't they have a larger brain  than we do, with more neurons?
p240
aVWhen we realized how much expensive it is
p241
aVto have a lot of neurons in the brain, I figured,
p242
aVmaybe there's a simple reason.
p243
aVThey just can't afford the energy
p244
aVfor both a large body  and a large number of neurons.
p245
aVSo we did the math.
p246
aVWe calculated on the one hand
p247
aVhow much energy a primate gets per day
p248
aVfrom eating raw foods,
p249
aVand on the other hand, how much energy
p250
aVa body of a certain size costs
p251
aVand how much energy a brain of a certain number of neurons costs,
p252
aVand we looked for the combinations
p253
aVof body size and number of brain neurons
p254
aVthat a primate could afford
p255
aVif it ate a certain number of hours per day.
p256
aa(lp257
VAnd what we found is that
p258
aVbecause neurons are so expensive,
p259
aVthere is a tradeoff between body size and number of neurons.
p260
aVSo a primate that eats eight hours per day
p261
aVcan afford at most 53 billion neurons,
p262
aVbut then its body cannot be any bigger
p263
aVthan 25 kilos.
p264
aVTo weigh any more than that,
p265
aVit has to give up neurons.
p266
aVSo it's either a large body
p267
aVor a large number of neurons.
p268
aVWhen you eat like a primate,
p269
aVyou can't afford both.
p270
aa(lp271
VOne way out of this metabolic limitation
p272
aVwould be to spend even more hours per day eating,
p273
aVbut that gets dangerous,
p274
aVand past a certain point, it's just not possible.
p275
aVGorillas and orangutans, for instance,
p276
aVafford about 30 billion neurons
p277
aVby spending eight and a half hours per day eating,
p278
aVand that seems to be about as much as they can do.
p279
aVNine hours of feeding per day
p280
aVseems to be the practical limit for a primate.
p281
aa(lp282
VWhat about us?
p283
aVWith our 86 billion neurons
p284
aVand 60 to 70 kilos of body mass,
p285
aVwe should have to spend over nine hours
p286
aVper day every single day feeding,
p287
aVwhich is just not feasible.
p288
aVIf we ate like a primate,
p289
aVwe should not be here.
p290
aa(lp291
VHow did we get here, then?
p292
aVWell, if our brain costs just as much energy
p293
aVas it should, and if we can't spend
p294
aVevery waking hour of the day feeding,
p295
aVthen the only alternative, really,
p296
aVis to somehow get more energy
p297
aVout of the same foods.
p298
aVAnd remarkably, that matches exactly
p299
aVwhat our ancestors are believed to have invented
p300
aVone and a half million years ago,
p301
aVwhen they invented cooking.
p302
aVTo cook is to use fire
p303
aVto pre-digest foods outside of your body.
p304
aVCooked foods are softer, so they're easier to chew
p305
aVand to turn completely into mush in your mouth,
p306
aVso that allows them to be completely digested
p307
aVand absorbed in your gut,
p308
aVwhich makes them yield much more energy in much less time.
p309
aVSo cooking frees time for us to do
p310
aVmuch more interesting things with our day
p311
aVand with our neurons
p312
aVthan just thinking about food,
p313
aVlooking for food, and gobbling down food
p314
aVall day long.
p315
aa(lp316
VSo because of cooking, what once was
p317
aVa major liability, this large,
p318
aVdangerously expensive brain with a lot of neurons,
p319
aVcould now become a major asset,
p320
aVnow that we could both afford  the energy for a lot of neurons
p321
aVand the time to do interesting things with them.
p322
aVSo I think this explains why the human brain
p323
aVgrew to become so large so fast in evolution,
p324
aVall of the while remaining just a primate brain.
p325
aVWith this large brain now affordable by cooking,
p326
aVwe went rapidly from raw foods to culture,
p327
aVagriculture, civilization, grocery stores,
p328
aVelectricity, refrigerators,
p329
aVall of those things that nowadays
p330
aVallow us to get all the energy we need
p331
aVfor the whole day in a single sitting
p332
aVat your favorite fast food joint.
p333
aVSo what once was a solution
p334
aVnow became the problem,
p335
aVand ironically, we look for the solution in raw food.
p336
aa(lp337
VSo what is the human advantage?
p338
aVWhat is it that we have
p339
aVthat no other animal has?
p340
aVMy answer is that we have the largest number
p341
aVof neurons in the cerebral cortex,
p342
aVand I think that's the simplest explanation
p343
aVfor our remarkable cognitive abilities.
p344
aVAnd what is it that we do that no other animal does,
p345
aVand which I believe was fundamental
p346
aVto allow us to reach that large,
p347
aVlargest number of neurons in the cortex?
p348
aVIn two words, we cook.
p349
aVNo other animal cooks its food. Only humans do.
p350
aVAnd I think that's how we got to become human.
p351
aa(lp352
VStudying the human brain changed  the way I think about food.
p353
aVI now look at my kitchen,
p354
aVand I bow to it,
p355
aVand I thank my ancestors for coming up
p356
aVwith the invention that probably made us humans.
p357
aVThank you very much.
