VHere are two reasons companies fail:
p4
aVthey only do more of the same,
p5
aVor they only do what's new.
p6
aa(lp7
VTo me the real, real solution to quality growth
p8
aVis figuring out the balance between two activities:
p9
aVexploration and exploitation.
p10
aVBoth are necessary,
p11
aVbut it can be too much of a good thing.
p12
aa(lp13
VConsider Facit.
p14
aVI'm actually old enough to remember them.
p15
aVFacit was a fantastic company.
p16
aVThey were born deep in the Swedish forest,
p17
aVand they made the best mechanical calculators in the world.
p18
aVEverybody used them.
p19
aVAnd what did Facit do when the electronic calculator came along?
p20
aVThey continued doing exactly the same.
p21
aVIn six months, they went from maximum revenue ...
p22
aVand they were gone.
p23
aVGone.
p24
aa(lp25
VTo me, the irony about the Facit story
p26
aVis hearing about the Facit engineers,
p27
aVwho had bought cheap, small electronic calculators in Japan
p28
aVthat they used to double-check their calculators.
p29
aa(lp30
V(Laughter)
p31
aa(lp32
VFacit did too much exploitation.
p33
aVBut exploration can go wild, too.
p34
aa(lp35
VA few years back,
p36
aVI worked closely alongside a European biotech company.
p37
aVLet's call them OncoSearch.
p38
aVThe company was brilliant.
p39
aVThey had applications that promised to diagnose, even cure,
p40
aVcertain forms of blood cancer.
p41
aVEvery day was about creating something new.
p42
aVThey were extremely innovative,
p43
aVand the mantra was, "When we only get it right,"
p44
aVor even, "We want it perfect."
p45
aVThe sad thing is,
p46
aVbefore they became perfect \u2014
p47
aVeven good enough \u2014
p48
aVthey became obsolete.
p49
aVOncoSearch did too much exploration.
p50
aa(lp51
VI first heard about exploration and exploitation about 15 years ago,
p52
aVwhen I worked as a visiting scholar at Stanford University.
p53
aVThe founder of the idea is Jim March.
p54
aVAnd to me the power of the idea is its practicality.
p55
aa(lp56
VExploration.
p57
aVExploration is about coming up with what's new.
p58
aVIt's about search,
p59
aVit's about discovery,
p60
aVit's about new products,
p61
aVit's about new innovations.
p62
aVIt's about changing our frontiers.
p63
aVOur heroes are people who have done exploration:
p64
aVMadame Curie,
p65
aVPicasso,
p66
aVNeil Armstrong,
p67
aVSir Edmund Hillary, etc.
p68
aVI come from Norway;
p69
aVall our heroes are explorers, and they deserve to be.
p70
aVWe all know that exploration is risky.
p71
aVWe don't know the answers,
p72
aVwe don't know if we're going to find them,
p73
aVand we know that the risks are high.
p74
aa(lp75
VExploitation is the opposite.
p76
aVExploitation is taking the knowledge we have
p77
aVand making good, better.
p78
aVExploitation is about making our trains run on time.
p79
aVIt's about making good products faster and cheaper.
p80
aVExploitation is not risky \u2014
p81
aVin the short term.
p82
aVBut if we only exploit,
p83
aVit's very risky in the long term.
p84
aVAnd I think we all have memories of the famous pop groups
p85
aVwho keep singing the same songs again and again,
p86
aVuntil they become obsolete or even pathetic.
p87
aVThat's the risk of exploitation.
p88
aa(lp89
VSo if we take a long-term perspective, we explore.
p90
aVIf we take a short-term perspective, we exploit.
p91
aVSmall children, they explore all day.
p92
aVAll day it's about exploration.
p93
aVAs we grow older,
p94
aVwe explore less because we have more knowledge to exploit on.
p95
aVThe same goes for companies.
p96
aVCompanies become, by nature, less innovative
p97
aVas they become more competent.
p98
aa(lp99
VAnd this is, of course, a big worry to CEOs.
p100
aVAnd I hear very often questions phrased in different ways.
p101
aVFor example,
p102
aV"How can I both effectively run and reinvent my company?"
p103
aVOr, "How can I make sure
p104
aVthat our company changes before we become obsolete
p105
aVor are hit by a crisis?"
p106
aVSo, doing one well is difficult.
p107
aVDoing both well as the same time is art \u2014
p108
aVpushing both exploration and exploitation.
p109
aa(lp110
VSo one thing we've found
p111
aVis only about two percent of companies are able to effectively explore
p112
aVand exploit at the same time, in parallel.
p113
aVBut when they do,
p114
aVthe payoffs are huge.
p115
aVSo we have lots of great examples.
p116
aVWe have Nestlé creating Nespresso,
p117
aVwe have Lego going into animated films,
p118
aVToyota creating the hybrids,
p119
aVUnilever pushing into sustainability \u2014
p120
aVthere are lots of examples, and the benefits are huge.
p121
aa(lp122
VWhy is balancing so difficult?
p123
aVI think it's difficult because there are so many traps
p124
aVthat keep us where we are.
p125
aVSo I'll talk about two, but there are many.
p126
aa(lp127
VSo let's talk about the perpetual search trap.
p128
aVWe discover something,
p129
aVbut we don't have the patience or the persistence
p130
aVto get at it and make it work.
p131
aVSo instead of staying with it, we create something new.
p132
aVBut the same goes for that,
p133
aVthen we're in the vicious circle
p134
aVof actually coming up with ideas but being frustrated.
p135
aVOncoSearch was a good example.
p136
aVA famous example is, of course, Xerox.
p137
aVBut we don't only see this in companies.
p138
aVWe see this in the public sector as well.
p139
aVWe all know that any kind of effective reform of education,
p140
aVresearch, health care, even defense,
p141
aVtakes 10, 15, maybe 20 years to work.
p142
aVBut still, we change much more often.
p143
aVWe really don't give them the chance.
p144
aa(lp145
VAnother trap is the success trap.
p146
aVFacit fell into the success trap.
p147
aVThey literally held the future in their hands,
p148
aVbut they couldn't see it.
p149
aVThey were simply so good at making what they loved doing,
p150
aVthat they wouldn't change.
p151
aVWe are like that, too.
p152
aVWhen we know something well, it's difficult to change.
p153
aVBill Gates has said:
p154
aV"Success is a lousy teacher.
p155
aVIt seduces us into thinking we cannot fail."
p156
aVThat's the challenge with success.
p157
aa(lp158
VSo I think there are some lessons, and I think they apply to us.
p159
aVAnd they apply to our companies.
p160
aVThe first lesson is: get ahead of the crisis.
p161
aVAnd any company that's able to innovate
p162
aVis actually able to also buy an insurance in the future.
p163
aVNetflix \u2014 they could so easily have been content
p164
aVwith earlier generations of distribution,
p165
aVbut they always \u2014 and I think they will always \u2014
p166
aVkeep pushing for the next battle.
p167
aVI see other companies that say,
p168
aV"I'll win the next innovation cycle, whatever it takes."
p169
aa(lp170
VSecond one: think in multiple time scales.
p171
aVI'll share a chart with you,
p172
aVand I think it's a wonderful one.
p173
aVAny company we look at,
p174
aVtaking a one-year perspective
p175
aVand looking at the valuation of the company,
p176
aVinnovation typically accounts for only about 30 percent.
p177
aVSo when we think one year,
p178
aVinnovation isn't really that important.
p179
aVMove ahead, take a 10-year perspective on the same company \u2014
p180
aVsuddenly, innovation and ability to renew account for 70 percent.
p181
aVBut companies can't choose.
p182
aVThey need to fund the journey and lead the long term.
p183
aa(lp184
VThird:
p185
aVinvite talent.
p186
aVI don't think it's possible for any of us
p187
aVto be able to balance exploration and exploitation by ourselves.
p188
aVI think it's a team sport.
p189
aVI think we need to allow challenging.
p190
aVI think the mark of a great company is being open to be challenged,
p191
aVand the mark of a good corporate board is to constructively challenge.
p192
aVI think that's also what good parenting is about.
p193
aa(lp194
VLast one: be skeptical of success.
p195
aVMaybe it's useful to think back at the old triumph marches in Rome,
p196
aVwhen the generals, after a big victory,
p197
aVwere given their celebration.
p198
aVRiding into Rome on the carriage,
p199
aVthey always had a companion whispering in their ear,
p200
aV"Remember, you're only human."
p201
aa(lp202
VSo I hope I made the point:
p203
aVbalancing exploration and exploitation
p204
aVhas a huge payoff.
p205
aVBut it's difficult, and we need to be conscious.
p206
aa(lp207
VI want to just point out two questions that I think are useful.
p208
aVFirst question is, looking at your own company:
p209
aVIn which areas do you see that the company is at the risk
p210
aVof falling into success traps,
p211
aVof just going on autopilot?
p212
aVAnd what can you do to challenge?
p213
aa(lp214
VSecond question is:
p215
aVWhen did I explore something new last,
p216
aVand what kind of effect did it have on me?
p217
aVIs that something I should do more of?
p218
aVIn my case, yes.
p219
aa(lp220
VSo let me leave you with this.
p221
aVWhether you're an explorer by nature
p222
aVor whether you tend to exploit what you already know,
p223
aVdon't forget: the beauty is in the balance.
p224
aa(lp225
VThank you.
