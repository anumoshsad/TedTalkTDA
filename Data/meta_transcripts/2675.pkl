VOne summer afternoon in 2013,
p4
aVDC police detained, questioned and searched a man
p5
aVwho appeared suspicious and potentially dangerous.
p6
aVThis wasn't what I was wearing the day of the detention, to be fair,
p7
aVbut I have a picture of that as well.
p8
aVI know it's very frightening \u2014 try to remain calm.
p9
aa(lp10
V(Laughter)
p11
aa(lp12
VAt this time, I was interning
p13
aVat the Public Defender Service in Washington DC,
p14
aVand I was visiting a police station for work.
p15
aVI was on my way out,
p16
aVand before I could make it to my car,
p17
aVtwo police cars pulled up to block my exit,
p18
aVand an officer approached me from behind.
p19
aVHe told me to stop, take my backpack off
p20
aVand put my hands on the police car parked next to us.
p21
aVAbout a dozen officers then gathered near us.
p22
aVAll of them had handguns,
p23
aVsome had assault rifles.
p24
aVThey rifled through my backpack.
p25
aVThey patted me down.
p26
aVThey took pictures of me spread on the police car,
p27
aVand they laughed.
p28
aa(lp29
VAnd as all this was happening \u2014
p30
aVas I was on the police car trying to ignore the shaking in my legs,
p31
aVtrying to think clearly about what I should do \u2014
p32
aVsomething stuck out to me as odd.
p33
aVWhen I look at myself in this photo,
p34
aVif I were to describe myself,
p35
aVI think I'd say something like,
p36
aV"19-year-old Indian male, bright T-shirt, wearing glasses."
p37
aVBut they weren't including any of these details.
p38
aVInto their police radios as they described me,
p39
aVthey kept saying, "Middle Eastern male with a backpack.
p40
aVMiddle Eastern male with a backpack."
p41
aVAnd this description carried on into their police reports.
p42
aVI never expected to be described by my own government in these terms:
p43
aV"lurking,"
p44
aV"nefarious,"
p45
aV"terrorist."
p46
aVAnd the detention dragged on like this.
p47
aa(lp48
VThey sent dogs trained to smell explosives to sweep the area I'd been in.
p49
aVThey called the federal government to see if I was on any watch lists.
p50
aVThey sent a couple of detectives to cross-examine me on why,
p51
aVif I claimed I had nothing to hide,
p52
aVI wouldn't consent to a search of my car.
p53
aVAnd I could see they weren't happy with me,
p54
aVbut I felt I had no way of knowing what they'd want to do next.
p55
aVAt one point, the officer who patted me down
p56
aVscanned the side of the police station to see where the security camera was
p57
aVto see how much of this was being recorded.
p58
aVAnd when he did that,
p59
aVit really sank in how completely I was at their mercy.
p60
aa(lp61
VI think we're all normalized from a young age
p62
aVto the idea of police officers and arrests and handcuffs,
p63
aVso it's easy to forget how demeaning and coercive a thing it is
p64
aVto seize control over another person's body.
p65
aVI know it sounds like the point of my story
p66
aVis how badly treated I was because of my race \u2014
p67
aVand yes, I don't think I would've been detained if I were white.
p68
aVBut actually, what I have in mind today is something else.
p69
aVWhat I have in mind is how much worse things might've been
p70
aVif I weren't affluent.
p71
aVI mean, they thought I might be trying to plant an explosive,
p72
aVand they investigated that possibility for an hour and a half,
p73
aVbut I was never put in handcuffs,
p74
aVI was never taken to a jail cell.
p75
aVI think if I were from one of Washington DC's poor communities of color,
p76
aVand they thought I was endangering officers' lives,
p77
aVthings might've ended differently.
p78
aVAnd in fact, in our system, I think it's better to be an affluent person
p79
aVsuspected of trying to blow up a police station
p80
aVthan it is to be a poor person
p81
aVwho's suspected of much, much less than this.
p82
aa(lp83
VI want to give you an example from my current work.
p84
aVRight now, I'm working at a civil rights organization in DC,
p85
aVcalled Equal Justice Under Law.
p86
aVLet me start by asking you all a question.
p87
aVHow many of you have ever gotten a parking ticket in your life?
p88
aVRaise your hand.
p89
aVYeah. So have I.
p90
aVAnd when I had to pay it,
p91
aVit felt annoying and it felt bad,
p92
aVbut I paid it and I moved on.
p93
aVI'm guessing most of you have paid your tickets as well.
p94
aVBut what would happen if you couldn't afford the amount on the ticket
p95
aVand your family doesn't have the money either, what happens then?
p96
aa(lp97
VWell, one thing that's not supposed to happen under the law is,
p98
aVyou're not supposed to be arrested and jailed
p99
aVsimply because you can't afford to pay.
p100
aVThat's illegal under federal law.
p101
aVBut that's what local governments across the country are doing
p102
aVto people who are poor.
p103
aVAnd so many of our lawsuits at Equal Justice Under Law
p104
aVtarget these modern-day debtors' prisons.
p105
aa(lp106
VOne of our cases is against Ferguson, Missouri.
p107
aVAnd I know when I say Ferguson,
p108
aVmany of you will think of police violence.
p109
aVBut today I want to talk about a different aspect
p110
aVof the relationship between their police force and their citizens.
p111
aVFerguson was issuing an average of over two arrest warrants,
p112
aVper person, per year,
p113
aVmostly for unpaid debt to the courts.
p114
aVWhen I imagine what that would feel like if, every time I left my house,
p115
aVthere was a chance a police officer would run my license plate,
p116
aVsee a warrant for unpaid debt,
p117
aVseize my body they way the did in DC
p118
aVand then take me to a jail cell,
p119
aVI feel a little sick.
p120
aa(lp121
VI've met many of the people in Ferguson who have experienced this,
p122
aVand I've heard some of their stories.
p123
aVIn Ferguson's jail,
p124
aVin each small cell, there's a bunk bed and a toilet,
p125
aVbut they'd pack four people into each cell.
p126
aVSo there'd be two people on the bunks and two people on the floor,
p127
aVone with nowhere to go except right next to the filthy toilet,
p128
aVwhich was never cleaned.
p129
aVIn fact, the whole cell was never cleaned,
p130
aVso the floor and the walls were lined with blood and mucus.
p131
aVNo water to drink,
p132
aVexcept coming out of a spigot connected to the toilet.
p133
aVThe water looked and tasted dirty,
p134
aVthere was never enough food,
p135
aVnever any showers,
p136
aVwomen menstruating without any hygiene products,
p137
aVno medical attention whatsoever.
p138
aVWhen I asked a woman about medical attention,
p139
aVshe laughed, and she said, "Oh, no, no.
p140
aVThe only attention you get from the guards in there is sexual."
p141
aa(lp142
VSo, they'd take the debtors to this place and they'd say,
p143
aV"We're not letting you leave until you make a payment on your debt."
p144
aVAnd if you could \u2014 if you could call a family member
p145
aVwho could somehow come up with some money,
p146
aVthen maybe you were out.
p147
aVIf it was enough money, you were out.
p148
aVBut if it wasn't, you'd stay there for days or weeks,
p149
aVand every day the guards would come down to the cells
p150
aVand haggle with the debtors about the price of release that day.
p151
aVYou'd stay until, at some point, the jail would be booked to capacity,
p152
aVand they'd want to book someone new in.
p153
aVAnd at that point, they'd think,
p154
aV"OK, it's unlikely this person can come up with the money,
p155
aVit's more likely this new person will."
p156
aVYou're out, they're in, and the machine kept moving like that.
p157
aa(lp158
VI met a man who,
p159
aVnine years ago, was arrested for panhandling in a Walgreens.
p160
aVHe couldn't afford his fines and his court fees from that case.
p161
aVWhen he was young he survived a house fire,
p162
aVonly because he jumped out of the third-story window to escape.
p163
aVBut that fall left him with damage to his brain
p164
aVand several parts of this body, including his leg.
p165
aVSo he can't work,
p166
aVand he relies on social security payments to survive.
p167
aVWhen I met him in his apartment,
p168
aVhe had nothing of value there \u2014 not even food in his fridge.
p169
aVHe's chronically hungry.
p170
aVHe had nothing of value in his apartment except a small piece of cardboard
p171
aVon which he'd written the names of his children.
p172
aVHe cherished this a lot. He was happy to show it to me.
p173
aVBut he can't pay his fines and fees because he has nothing to give.
p174
aVIn the last nine years, he's been arrested 13 times,
p175
aVand jailed for a total of 130 days on that panhandling case.
p176
aVOne of those stretches lasted 45 days.
p177
aVJust imagine spending from right now until sometime in June
p178
aVin the place that I described to you a few moments ago.
p179
aa(lp180
VHe told me about all the suicide attempts he's seen in Ferguson's jail;
p181
aVabout the time a man found a way to hang himself
p182
aVout of reach of the other inmates,
p183
aVso all they could do was yell and yell and yell,
p184
aVtrying to get the guards' attention
p185
aVso they could come down and cut him down.
p186
aVAnd he told me that it took the guards over five minutes to respond,
p187
aVand when they came, the man was unconscious.
p188
aVSo they called the paramedics and the paramedics went to the cell.
p189
aVThey said, "He'll be OK,"
p190
aVso they just left him there on the floor.
p191
aVI heard many stories like this and they shouldn't have surprised me,
p192
aVbecause suicide is the single leading cause of death in our local jails.
p193
aVThis is related to the lack of mental health care in our jails.
p194
aa(lp195
VI met a woman, single mother of three, making seven dollars an hour.
p196
aVShe relies on food stamps to feed herself and her children.
p197
aVAbout a decade ago,
p198
aVshe got a couple of traffic tickets and a minor theft charge,
p199
aVand she can't afford her fines and fees on those cases.
p200
aVSince then, she's been jailed about 10 times on those cases,
p201
aVbut she has schizophrenia and bipolar disorder,
p202
aVand she needs medication every day.
p203
aVShe doesn't have access to those medications in Ferguson's jail,
p204
aVbecause no one has access to their medications.
p205
aVShe told me about what it was like to spend two weeks in a cage,
p206
aVhallucinating people and shadows and hearing voices,
p207
aVbegging for the medication that would make it all stop,
p208
aVonly to be ignored.
p209
aVAnd this isn't anomalous, either:
p210
aVthirty percent of women in our local jails have serious mental health needs
p211
aVjust like hers,
p212
aVbut only one in six receives any mental health care while in jail.
p213
aa(lp214
VAnd so, I heard all these stories about this grotesque dungeon
p215
aVthat Ferguson was operating for its debtors,
p216
aVand when it came time for me to actually see it
p217
aVand to go visit Ferguson's jail,
p218
aVI'm not sure what I was expecting to see,
p219
aVbut I wasn't expecting this.
p220
aVIt's an ordinary government building.
p221
aVIt could be a post office or a school.
p222
aVIt reminded me that these illegal extortion schemes
p223
aVaren't being run somewhere in the shadows,
p224
aVthey're being run out in the open by our public officials.
p225
aVThey're a matter of public policy.
p226
aVAnd this reminded me that poverty jailing in general,
p227
aVeven outside the debtors' prison context,
p228
aVplays a very visible and central role in our justice system.
p229
aa(lp230
VWhat I have in mind is our policy of bail.
p231
aVIn our system, whether you're detained or free,
p232
aVpending trial is not a matter of how dangerous you are
p233
aVor how much of a flight risk you pose.
p234
aVIt's a matter of whether you can afford to post your bail amount.
p235
aVSo Bill Cosby, whose bail was set at a million dollars,
p236
aVimmediately writes the check, and doesn't spend a second in a jail cell.
p237
aVBut Sandra Bland, who died in jail,
p238
aVwas only there because her family was unable to come up with 500 dollars.
p239
aVIn fact, there are half a million Sandra Blands across the country \u2014
p240
aV500,000 people who are in jail right now,
p241
aVonly because they can't afford their bail amount.
p242
aa(lp243
VWe're told that our jails are places for criminals,
p244
aVbut statistically that's not the case:
p245
aVthree out of every five people in jail right now are there pretrial.
p246
aVThey haven't been convicted of any crime;
p247
aVthey haven't pled guilty to any offense.
p248
aVRight here in San Francisco,
p249
aV85 percent of the inmates in our jail in San Francisco
p250
aVare pretrial detainees.
p251
aVThis means San Francisco is spending something like 80 million dollars
p252
aVevery year
p253
aVto fund pretrial detention.
p254
aa(lp255
VMany of these people who are in jail only because they can't post bail
p256
aVare facing allegations so minor
p257
aVthat the amount of time it would take for them to sit waiting for trial
p258
aVis longer than the sentence they would receive if convicted,
p259
aVwhich means they're guaranteed to get out faster
p260
aVif they just plead guilty.
p261
aVSo now the choice is:
p262
aVShould I stay here in this horrible place,
p263
aVaway from my family and my dependents,
p264
aValmost guaranteed to lose my job,
p265
aVand then fight the charges?
p266
aVOr should I just plead guilty to whatever the prosecutor wants and get out?
p267
aVAnd at this point, they're pretrial detainees, not criminals.
p268
aVBut once they take that plea deal, we'll call them criminals,
p269
aVeven though an affluent person would never have been in this situation,
p270
aVbecause an affluent person would have simply been bailed out.
p271
aa(lp272
VAt this point you might be wondering,
p273
aV"This guy's in the inspiration section, what is he doing \u2014
p274
aa(lp275
V(Laughter)
p276
aa(lp277
V"This is extremely depressing. I want my money back."
p278
aa(lp279
V(Laughter)
p280
aa(lp281
VBut in actuality,
p282
aVI find talking about jailing much less depressing than the alternative,
p283
aVbecause I think if we don't talk about these issues
p284
aVand collectively change how we think about jailing,
p285
aVat the end of all of our lives,
p286
aVwe'll still have jails full of poor people who don't belong there.
p287
aVThat really is depressing to me.
p288
aVBut what's exciting to me is the thought that these stories can move us
p289
aVto think about jailing in different terms.
p290
aVNot in sterile policy terms like "mass incarceration,"
p291
aVor "sentencing of nonviolent offenders,"
p292
aVbut in human terms.
p293
aa(lp294
VWhen we put a human being in a cage for days or weeks or months
p295
aVor even years,
p296
aVwhat are we doing to that person's mind and body?
p297
aVUnder what conditions are we really willing to do that?
p298
aVAnd so if starting with a few hundred of us in this room,
p299
aVwe can commit to thinking about jailing in this different light,
p300
aVthen we can undo that normalization I was referring to earlier.
p301
aa(lp302
VIf I leave you with anything today, I hope it's with the thought
p303
aVthat if we want anything to fundamentally change \u2014
p304
aVnot just to reform our policies on bail and fines and fees \u2014
p305
aVbut also to make sure that whatever new policies replace those
p306
aVdon't punish the poor and the marginalized in their own new way.
p307
aVIf we want that kind of change,
p308
aVthen this shift in thinking is required of each of us.
p309
aa(lp310
VThank you.
