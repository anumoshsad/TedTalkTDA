VHow many of you have been to Oklahoma City?
p4
aa(lp5
VRaise your hand. Yeah?
p6
aa(lp7
VHow many of you have not been to Oklahoma City
p8
aVand have no idea who I am? (Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
VMost of you. Let me give you a little bit of background.
p11
aa(lp12
VOklahoma City started in the most
p13
aVunique way imaginable.
p14
aVBack on a spring day in 1889,
p15
aVthe federal government held what they called
p16
aVa land run.
p17
aVThey literally lined up the settlers
p18
aValong an imaginary line,
p19
aVand they fired off a gun,
p20
aVand the settlers roared across the countryside
p21
aVand put down a stake,
p22
aVand wherever they put down that stake,
p23
aVthat was their new home.
p24
aVAnd at the end of the very first day,
p25
aVthe population of Oklahoma City
p26
aVhad gone from zero to 10,000,
p27
aVand our planning department
p28
aVis still paying for that.
p29
aVThe citizens got together on that first day
p30
aVand elected a mayor.
p31
aVAnd then they shot him.
p32
aV(Laughter)
p33
aVThat's not really all that funny
p34
aV\u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p35
aVbut it allows me to see what type of audience
p36
aVI'm dealing with, so I appreciate the feedback.
p37
aa(lp38
VThe 20th century was fairly kind to Oklahoma City.
p39
aVOur economy was based on commodities,
p40
aVso the price of cotton or the price of wheat,
p41
aVand ultimately the price of oil and natural gas.
p42
aVAnd along the way, we became a city
p43
aVof innovation.
p44
aVThe shopping cart was invented in Oklahoma City.
p45
aV(Applause)
p46
aVThe parking meter, invented in Oklahoma City.
p47
aVYou're welcome.
p48
aa(lp49
VHaving an economy, though,
p50
aVthat relates to commodities can give you some ups and some downs,
p51
aVand that was certainly the case in Oklahoma City's history.
p52
aVIn the 1970s, when it appeared
p53
aVthat the price of energy would never retreat,
p54
aVour economy was soaring,
p55
aVand then in the early 1980s, it cratered quickly.
p56
aVThe price of energy dropped.
p57
aVOur banks began to fail.
p58
aVBefore the end of the decade,
p59
aV100 banks had failed in the state of Oklahoma.
p60
aVThere was no bailout on the horizon.
p61
aVOur banking industry, our oil and gas industry,
p62
aVour commercial real estate industry,
p63
aVwere all at the bottom of the economic scale.
p64
aVYoung people were leaving Oklahoma City in droves
p65
aVfor Washington and Dallas and Houston and New York and Tokyo,
p66
aVanywhere where they could  find a job that measured up
p67
aVto their educational attainment,
p68
aVbecause in Oklahoma City, the good jobs just weren't there.
p69
aa(lp70
VBut along at the end of the '80s
p71
aVcame an enterprising businessman
p72
aVwho became mayor named Ron Norick.
p73
aVRon Norick eventually figured out
p74
aVthat the secret to economic development
p75
aVwasn't incentivizing companies up front,
p76
aVit was about creating a place where businesses wanted to locate,
p77
aVand so he pushed an initiative called MAPS
p78
aVthat basically was a penny-on-the-dollar sales tax
p79
aVto build a bunch of stuff.
p80
aVIt built a new sports arena,
p81
aVa new canal downtown,
p82
aVit fixed up our performing arts center,
p83
aVa new baseball stadium downtown,
p84
aVa lot of things to improve the quality of life.
p85
aVAnd the economy indeed seemed to start
p86
aVshowing some signs of life.
p87
aa(lp88
VThe next mayor came along.
p89
aVHe started MAPS for Kids,
p90
aVrebuilt the entire inner city school system,
p91
aVall 75 buildings either built anew or refurbished.
p92
aa(lp93
VAnd then, in 2004,
p94
aVin this rare collective lack of judgment
p95
aVbordering on civil disobedience,
p96
aVthe citizens elected me mayor.
p97
aa(lp98
VNow the city I inherited
p99
aVwas just on the verge
p100
aVof coming out of its slumbering economy,
p101
aVand for the very first time,
p102
aVwe started showing up on the lists.
p103
aVNow you know the lists I'm talking about.
p104
aVThe media and the Internet
p105
aVlove to rank cities.
p106
aVAnd in Oklahoma City,
p107
aVwe'd never really been on lists before.
p108
aVSo I thought it was kind of cool
p109
aVwhen they came out with these positive lists and we were on there.
p110
aVWe weren't anywhere close to the top,
p111
aVbut we were on the list, we were somebody.
p112
aVBest city to get a job,
p113
aVbest city to start a business,
p114
aVbest downtown \u2014
p115
aVOklahoma City.
p116
aa(lp117
VAnd then came the list
p118
aVof the most obese cities in the country.
p119
aVAnd there we were.
p120
aa(lp121
VNow I like to point out that we were on that list
p122
aVwith a lot of really cool places.
p123
aV(Laughter)
p124
aVDallas and Houston and New Orleans
p125
aVand Atlanta and Miami.
p126
aVYou know, these are cities that, typically,
p127
aVyou're not embarrassed to be associated with.
p128
aVBut nonetheless, I didn't like being on the list.
p129
aa(lp130
VAnd about that time, I got on the scales.
p131
aVAnd I weighed 220 pounds.
p132
aVAnd then I went to this website
p133
aVsponsored by the federal government,
p134
aVand I typed in my height, I typed in my weight,
p135
aVand I pushed Enter,
p136
aVand it came back and said "obese."
p137
aa(lp138
VI thought, "What a stupid website."
p139
aV(Laughter)
p140
aV"I'm not obese. I would know if I was obese."
p141
aa(lp142
VAnd then I started getting honest with myself
p143
aVabout what had become my lifelong struggle with obesity,
p144
aVand I noticed this pattern,
p145
aVthat I was gaining about two or three pounds a year,
p146
aVand then about every 10 years, I'd drop 20 or 30 pounds.
p147
aVAnd then I'd do it again.
p148
aVAnd I had this huge closet full of clothes,
p149
aVand I could only wear a third of it at any one time,
p150
aVand only I knew which part of the closet I could wear.
p151
aVBut it all seemed fairly normal, going through it.
p152
aa(lp153
VWell, I finally decided I needed to lose weight,
p154
aVand I knew I could because I'd done it so many times before,
p155
aVso I simply stopped eating as much.
p156
aVI had always exercised.
p157
aVThat really wasn't the part of the equation
p158
aVthat I needed to work on.
p159
aVBut I had been eating 3,000 calories a day,
p160
aVand I cut it to 2,000 calories a day,
p161
aVand the weight came off. I lost about a pound a week
p162
aVfor about 40 weeks.
p163
aa(lp164
VAlong the way, though,
p165
aVI started examining my city,
p166
aVits culture, its infrastructure,
p167
aVtrying to figure out why our specific city
p168
aVseemed to have a problem with obesity.
p169
aVAnd I came to the conclusion
p170
aVthat we had built an incredible quality of life
p171
aVif you happen to be a car.
p172
aV(Laughter)
p173
aVBut if you happen to be a person,
p174
aVyou are combatting the car seemingly at every turn.
p175
aVOur city is very spread out.
p176
aVWe have a great intersection of highways,
p177
aVI mean, literally no traffic congestion in Oklahoma City to speak of.
p178
aVAnd so people live far, far away.
p179
aVOur city limits are enormous, 620 square miles,
p180
aVbut 15 miles is less than 15 minutes.
p181
aVYou literally can get a speeding ticket
p182
aVduring rush hour in Oklahoma City.
p183
aVAnd as a result, people tend to spread out.
p184
aVLand's cheap.
p185
aVWe had also not required developers
p186
aVto build sidewalks on new developments  for a long, long time.
p187
aVWe had fixed that, but it had been relatively recently,
p188
aVand there were literally 100,000
p189
aVor more homes into our inventory
p190
aVin neighborhoods that had  virtually no level of walkability.
p191
aa(lp192
VAnd as I tried to examine
p193
aVhow we might deal with obesity,
p194
aVand was taking all of these elements into my mind,
p195
aVI decided that the first thing we need to do
p196
aVwas have a conversation.
p197
aVYou see, in Oklahoma City,
p198
aVwe weren't talking about obesity.
p199
aVAnd so, on New Year's Eve of 2007,
p200
aVI went to the zoo,
p201
aVand I stood in front of the elephants,
p202
aVand I said, "This city is going on a diet,
p203
aVand we're going to lose a million pounds."
p204
aa(lp205
VWell, that's when all hell broke loose.
p206
aa(lp207
V(Laughter)
p208
aa(lp209
VThe national media
p210
aVgravitated toward this story immediately,
p211
aVand they really could have  gone with it one of two ways.
p212
aVThey could have said,
p213
aV"This city is so fat
p214
aVthat the mayor had to put them on a diet."
p215
aVBut fortunately, the consensus was,
p216
aV"Look, this is a problem in a lot of places.
p217
aVThis is a city that's wanting to do something about it."
p218
aVAnd so they started helping us
p219
aVdrive traffic to the website.
p220
aVNow, the web address was
p221
aVthiscityisgoingonadiet.com.
p222
aVAnd I appeared on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show"
p223
aVone weekday morning to talk about the initiative,
p224
aVand on that day, 150,000 visits
p225
aVwere placed to our website.
p226
aVPeople were signing up,
p227
aVand so the pounds started to add up,
p228
aVand the conversation that I thought
p229
aVwas so important to have was starting to take place.
p230
aVIt was taking place inside the homes,
p231
aVmothers and fathers talking about it with their kids.
p232
aVIt was taking place in churches.
p233
aVChurches were starting their own running groups
p234
aVand their own support groups
p235
aVfor people who were dealing with obesity.
p236
aVSuddenly, it was a topic worth discussing at schools
p237
aVand in the workplace.
p238
aVAnd the large companies, they typically have
p239
aVwonderful wellness programs,
p240
aVbut the medium-sized companies
p241
aVthat typically fall between the cracks on issues like this,
p242
aVthey started to get engaged and used our program
p243
aVas a model for their own employees
p244
aVto try and have contests to see
p245
aVwho might be able to deal with their obesity situation
p246
aVin a way that could be proactively beneficial to others.
p247
aa(lp248
VAnd then came the next stage of the equation.
p249
aVIt was time to push what I called MAPS 3.
p250
aVNow MAPS 3, like the other two programs,
p251
aVhad had an economic development motive behind it,
p252
aVbut along with the traditional economic development tasks
p253
aVlike building a new convention center,
p254
aVwe added some health-related infrastructure
p255
aVto the process.
p256
aVWe added a new central park, 70 acres in size,
p257
aVto be right downtown in Oklahoma City.
p258
aVWe're building a downtown streetcar
p259
aVto try and help the walkability formula
p260
aVfor people who choose to live in the inner city
p261
aVand help us create the density there.
p262
aVWe're building senior health and wellness centers
p263
aVthroughout the community.
p264
aVWe put some investments on the river
p265
aVthat had originally been invested upon
p266
aVin the original MAPS,
p267
aVand now we are currently in the final stages
p268
aVof developing the finest venue in the world
p269
aVfor the sports of canoe, kayak and rowing.
p270
aVWe hosted the Olympic trials last spring.
p271
aVWe have Olympic-caliber events coming to Oklahoma City,
p272
aVand athletes from all over the world moving in,
p273
aValong with inner city programs
p274
aVto get kids more engaged in these types of recreational activities
p275
aVthat are a little bit nontraditional.
p276
aVWe also, with another initiative that was passed,
p277
aVare building hundreds of miles of new sidewalks
p278
aVthroughout the metro area.
p279
aVWe're even going back into some
p280
aVinner city situations
p281
aVwhere we had built neighborhoods
p282
aVand we had built schools
p283
aVbut we had not connected the two.
p284
aVWe had built libraries and we had built neighborhoods,
p285
aVbut we had never really connected the two
p286
aVwith any sort of walkability.
p287
aVThrough yet another funding source,
p288
aVwe're redesigning all of our inner city streets
p289
aVto be more pedestrian-friendly.
p290
aVOur streets were really wide,
p291
aVand you'd push the button to allow you to walk across,
p292
aVand you had to run in order to get there in time.
p293
aVBut now we've narrowed the streets,
p294
aVhighly landscaped them, making them more pedestrian-friendly,
p295
aVreally a redesign, rethinking the way
p296
aVwe build our infrastructure,
p297
aVdesigning a city around people and not cars.
p298
aVWe're completing our bicycle trail master plan.
p299
aVWe'll have over 100 miles
p300
aVwhen we're through building it out.
p301
aa(lp302
VAnd so you see this culture starting to shift
p303
aVin Oklahoma City.
p304
aVAnd lo and behold, the demographic changes
p305
aVthat are coming with it are very inspiring.
p306
aVHighly educated twentysomethings
p307
aVare moving to Oklahoma City from all over the region
p308
aVand, indeed, even from further away, in California.
p309
aa(lp310
VWhen we reached a million pounds,
p311
aVin January of 2012,
p312
aVI flew to New York with some our participants
p313
aVwho had lost over 100 pounds,
p314
aVwhose lives had been changed,
p315
aVand we appeared on the Rachael Ray show,
p316
aVand then that afternoon, I did a round of media in New York
p317
aVpushing the same messages
p318
aVthat you're accustomed to hearing about obesity and the dangers of it.
p319
aVAnd I went into the lobby of Men's Fitness magazine,
p320
aVthe same magazine that had put us on that list
p321
aVfive years before.
p322
aVAnd as I'm sitting in the lobby waiting to talk to the reporter,
p323
aVI notice there's a magazine copy
p324
aVof the current issue right there on the table,
p325
aVand I pick it up, and I look at the headline
p326
aVacross the top, and it says,
p327
aV"America's Fattest Cities: Do You Live in One?"
p328
aVWell, I knew I did,
p329
aVso I picked up the magazine
p330
aVand I began to look,
p331
aVand we weren't on it.
p332
aa(lp333
V(Applause)
p334
aa(lp335
VThen I looked on the list of fittest cities,
p336
aVand we were on that list.
p337
aVWe were on the list as the 22nd fittest city in the United States.
p338
aVOur state health statistics are doing better.
p339
aVGranted, we have a long way to go.
p340
aVHealth is still not something
p341
aVthat we should be proud of in Oklahoma City,
p342
aVbut we seem to have turned the cultural shift
p343
aVof making health a greater priority.
p344
aVAnd we love the idea of the demographics
p345
aVof highly educated twentysomethings,
p346
aVpeople with choices, choosing Oklahoma City
p347
aVin large numbers.
p348
aVWe have the lowest unemployment in the United States,
p349
aVprobably the strongest economy in the United States.
p350
aVAnd if you're like me, at some point
p351
aVin your educational career,
p352
aVyou were asked to read a book called
p353
aV"The Grapes of Wrath."
p354
aVOklahomans leaving for California
p355
aVin large numbers for a better future.
p356
aVWhen we look at the demographic shifts
p357
aVof people coming from the west,
p358
aVit appears that what we're seeing now
p359
aVis the wrath of grapes.
p360
aV(Laughter)
p361
aV(Applause)
p362
aVThe grandchildren are coming home.
p363
aa(lp364
VYou've been a great audience and very attentive.
p365
aVThank you very much for having me here.
