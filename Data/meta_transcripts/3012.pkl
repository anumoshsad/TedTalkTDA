VChis Anderson: Christiane, great to have you here.
p4
aVSo you've had this amazing viewpoint,
p5
aVand perhaps it's fair to say that in the last few years,
p6
aVthere have been some alarming developments that you're seeing.
p7
aVWhat's alarmed you most?
p8
aa(lp9
VChristiane Amanpour: Well, just listening to the earlier speakers,
p10
aVI can frame it in what they've been saying:
p11
aVclimate change, for instance \u2014 cities, the threat to our environment
p12
aVand our lives.
p13
aVIt basically also boils down to understanding the truth
p14
aVand to be able to get to the truth of what we're talking about
p15
aVin order to really be able to solve it.
p16
aVSo if 99.9 percent of the science on climate
p17
aVis empirical, scientific evidence,
p18
aVbut it's competing almost equally with a handful of deniers,
p19
aVthat is not the truth;
p20
aVthat is the epitome of fake news.
p21
aVAnd so for me, the last few years \u2014 certainly this last year \u2014
p22
aVhas crystallized the notion of fake news in a way that's truly alarming
p23
aVand not just some slogan to be thrown around.
p24
aVBecause when you can't distinguish between the truth and fake news,
p25
aVyou have a very much more difficult time trying to solve
p26
aVsome of the great issues that we face.
p27
aa(lp28
VCA: Well, you've been involved in this question of,
p29
aVwhat is balance, what is truth, what is impartiality,
p30
aVfor a long time.
p31
aVYou were on the front lines reporting the Balkan Wars 25 years ago.
p32
aVAnd back then, you famously said,
p33
aVby calling out human right abuses,
p34
aVyou said, "Look, there are some situations one simply cannot be neutral about,
p35
aVbecause when you're neutral,
p36
aVyou are an accomplice."
p37
aVSo, do you feel that today's journalists aren't heeding that advice
p38
aVabout balance?
p39
aa(lp40
VCA: Well, look, I think for journalists, objectivity is the golden rule.
p41
aVBut I think sometimes we don't understand what objectivity means.
p42
aVAnd I actually learned this very, very young in my career,
p43
aVwhich was during the Balkan Wars.
p44
aVI was young then.
p45
aVIt was about 25 years ago.
p46
aVAnd what we faced was the wholesale violation, not just of human rights,
p47
aVbut all the way to ethnic cleansing and genocide,
p48
aVand that has been adjudicated in the highest war crimes court
p49
aVin the world.
p50
aVSo, we know what we were seeing.
p51
aVTrying to tell the world what we were seeing
p52
aVbrought us accusations of bias,
p53
aVof siding with one side,
p54
aVof not seeing the whole side,
p55
aVand just, you know, trying to tell one story.
p56
aVI particularly and personally was accused of siding with,
p57
aVfor instance, the citizens of Sarajevo \u2014
p58
aV"siding with the Muslims,"
p59
aVbecause they were the minority who were being attacked
p60
aVby Christians on the Serb side
p61
aVin this area.
p62
aVAnd it worried me.
p63
aVIt worried me that I was being accused of this.
p64
aVI thought maybe I was wrong,
p65
aVmaybe I'd forgotten what objectivity was.
p66
aa(lp67
VBut then I started to understand that what people wanted
p68
aVwas actually not to do anything \u2014
p69
aVnot to step in,
p70
aVnot to change the situation,
p71
aVnot to find a solution.
p72
aVAnd so, their fake news at that time,
p73
aVtheir lie at that time \u2014
p74
aVincluding our government's, our democratically elected government's,
p75
aVwith values and principles of human rights \u2014
p76
aVtheir lie was to say that all sides are equally guilty,
p77
aVthat this has been centuries of ethnic hatred,
p78
aVwhereas we knew that wasn't true,
p79
aVthat one side had decided to kill, slaughter and ethnically cleanse
p80
aVanother side.
p81
aVSo that is where, for me,
p82
aVI understood that objectivity means giving all sides an equal hearing
p83
aVand talking to all sides,
p84
aVbut not treating all sides equally,
p85
aVnot creating a forced moral equivalence or a factual equivalence.
p86
aVAnd when you come up against that crisis point
p87
aVin situations of grave violations of international and humanitarian law,
p88
aVif you don't understand what you're seeing,
p89
aVif you don't understand the truth
p90
aVand if you get trapped in the fake news paradigm,
p91
aVthen you are an accomplice.
p92
aVAnd I refuse to be an accomplice to genocide.
p93
aa(lp94
V(Applause)
p95
aa(lp96
VCH: So there have always been these propaganda battles,
p97
aVand you were courageous in taking the stand you took back then.
p98
aVToday, there's a whole new way, though,
p99
aVin which news seems to be becoming fake.
p100
aVHow would you characterize that?
p101
aa(lp102
VCA: Well, look \u2014 I am really alarmed.
p103
aVAnd everywhere I look,
p104
aVyou know, we're buffeted by it.
p105
aVObviously, when the leader of the free world,
p106
aVwhen the most powerful person in the entire world,
p107
aVwhich is the president of the United States \u2014
p108
aVthis is the most important, most powerful country in the whole world,
p109
aVeconomically, militarily, politically in every which way \u2014
p110
aVand it seeks to, obviously, promote its values and power around the world.
p111
aVSo we journalists, who only seek the truth \u2014
p112
aVI mean, that is our mission \u2014
p113
aVwe go around the world looking for the truth
p114
aVin order to be everybody's eyes and ears,
p115
aVpeople who can't go out in various parts of the world
p116
aVto figure out what's going on about things that are vitally important
p117
aVto everybody's health and security.
p118
aVSo when you have a major world leader accusing you of fake news,
p119
aVit has an exponential ripple effect.
p120
aVAnd what it does is, it starts to chip away
p121
aVat not just our credibility,
p122
aVbut at people's minds \u2014
p123
aVpeople who look at us, and maybe they're thinking,
p124
aV"Well, if the president of the United States says that,
p125
aVmaybe somewhere there's a truth in there."
p126
aa(lp127
VCH: Presidents have always been critical of the media \u2014
p128
aa(lp129
VCA: Not in this way.
p130
aa(lp131
VCH: So, to what extent \u2014
p132
aa(lp133
V(Laughter)
p134
aa(lp135
V(Applause)
p136
aa(lp137
VCH: I mean, someone a couple years ago looking at the avalanche of information
p138
aVpouring through Twitter and Facebook and so forth,
p139
aVmight have said,
p140
aV"Look, our democracies are healthier than they've ever been.
p141
aVThere's more news than ever.
p142
aVOf course presidents will say what they'll say,
p143
aVbut everyone else can say what they will say.
p144
aVWhat's not to like? How is there an extra danger?"
p145
aa(lp146
VCA: So, I wish that was true.
p147
aVI wish that the proliferation of platforms upon which we get our information
p148
aVmeant that there was a proliferation of truth and transparency
p149
aVand depth and accuracy.
p150
aVBut I think the opposite has happened.
p151
aVYou know, I'm a little bit of a Luddite,
p152
aVI will confess.
p153
aVEven when we started to talk about the information superhighway,
p154
aVwhich was a long time ago,
p155
aVbefore social media, Twitter and all the rest of it,
p156
aVI was actually really afraid
p157
aVthat that would put people into certain lanes and tunnels
p158
aVand have them just focusing on areas of their own interest
p159
aVinstead of seeing the broad picture.
p160
aVAnd I'm afraid to say that with algorithms, with logarithms,
p161
aVwith whatever the "-ithms" are
p162
aVthat direct us into all these particular channels of information,
p163
aVthat seems to be happening right now.
p164
aVI mean, people have written about this phenomenon.
p165
aVPeople have said that yes, the internet came,
p166
aVits promise was to exponentially explode our access to more democracy,
p167
aVmore information,
p168
aVless bias,
p169
aVmore varied information.
p170
aVAnd, in fact, the opposite has happened.
p171
aVAnd so that, for me, is incredibly dangerous.
p172
aVAnd again, when you are the president of this country and you say things,
p173
aVit also gives leaders in other undemocratic countries the cover
p174
aVto affront us even worse,
p175
aVand to really whack us \u2014 and their own journalists \u2014
p176
aVwith this bludgeon of fake news.
p177
aa(lp178
VCH: To what extent is what happened, though,
p179
aVin part, just an unintended consequence,
p180
aVthat the traditional media that you worked in
p181
aVhad this curation-mediation role,
p182
aVwhere certain norms were observed,
p183
aVcertain stories would be rejected because they weren't credible,
p184
aVbut now that the standard for publication and for amplification
p185
aVis just interest, attention, excitement, click,
p186
aV"Did it get clicked on?"
p187
aV"Send it out there!"
p188
aVand that's what's \u2014 is that part of what's caused the problem?
p189
aa(lp190
VCA: I think it's a big problem, and we saw this in the election of 2016,
p191
aVwhere the idea of "clickbait" was very sexy and very attractive,
p192
aVand so all these fake news sites and fake news items
p193
aVwere not just haphazardly and by happenstance being put out there,
p194
aVthere's been a whole industry in the creation of fake news
p195
aVin parts of Eastern Europe, wherever,
p196
aVand you know, it's planted in real space and in cyberspace.
p197
aVSo I think that, also,
p198
aVthe ability of our technology to proliferate this stuff
p199
aVat the speed of sound or light, just about \u2014
p200
aVwe've never faced that before.
p201
aVAnd we've never faced such a massive amount of information
p202
aVwhich is not curated
p203
aVby those whose profession leads them to abide by the truth,
p204
aVto fact-check
p205
aVand to maintain a code of conduct and a code of professional ethics.
p206
aa(lp207
VCH: Many people here may know people who work at Facebook
p208
aVor Twitter and Google and so on.
p209
aVThey all seem like great people with good intention \u2014
p210
aVlet's assume that.
p211
aVIf you could speak with the leaders of those companies,
p212
aVwhat would you say to them?
p213
aa(lp214
VCA: Well, you know what \u2014
p215
aVI'm sure they are incredibly well-intentioned,
p216
aVand they certainly developed an unbelievable, game-changing system,
p217
aVwhere everybody's connected on this thing called Facebook.
p218
aVAnd they've created a massive economy for themselves
p219
aVand an amazing amount of income.
p220
aVI would just say,
p221
aV"Guys, you know, it's time to wake up and smell the coffee
p222
aVand look at what's happening to us right now."
p223
aVMark Zuckerberg wants to create a global community.
p224
aVI want to know: What is that global community going to look like?
p225
aVI want to know where the codes of conduct actually are.
p226
aVMark Zuckerberg said \u2014
p227
aVand I don't blame him, he probably believed this \u2014
p228
aVthat it was crazy to think
p229
aVthat the Russians or anybody else could be tinkering and messing around
p230
aVwith this avenue.
p231
aVAnd what have we just learned in the last few weeks?
p232
aVThat, actually, there has been a major problem in that regard,
p233
aVand now they're having to investigate it and figure it out.
p234
aVYes, they're trying to do what they can now
p235
aVto prevent the rise of fake news,
p236
aVbut, you know,
p237
aVit went pretty unrestricted for a long, long time.
p238
aVSo I guess I would say, you know,
p239
aVyou guys are brilliant at technology;
p240
aVlet's figure out another algorithm.
p241
aVCan we not?
p242
aa(lp243
VCH: An algorithm that includes journalistic investigation \u2014
p244
aa(lp245
VCA: I don't really know how they do it, but somehow, you know \u2014
p246
aVfilter out the crap!
p247
aa(lp248
V(Laughter)
p249
aa(lp250
VAnd not just the unintentional \u2014
p251
aa(lp252
V(Applause)
p253
aa(lp254
Vbut the deliberate lies that are planted
p255
aVby people who've been doing this as a matter of warfare
p256
aVfor decades.
p257
aVThe Soviets, the Russians \u2014
p258
aVthey are the masters of war by other means, of hybrid warfare.
p259
aVAnd this is a \u2014
p260
aVthis is what they've decided to do.
p261
aVIt worked in the United States,
p262
aVit didn't work in France,
p263
aVit hasn't worked in Germany.
p264
aVDuring the elections there, where they've tried to interfere,
p265
aVthe president of France right now, Emmanuel Macron,
p266
aVtook a very tough stand and confronted it head on,
p267
aVas did Angela Merkel.
p268
aa(lp269
VCH: There's some hope to be had from some of this, isn't there?
p270
aVThat the world learns.
p271
aVWe get fooled once,
p272
aVmaybe we get fooled again,
p273
aVbut maybe not the third time.
p274
aVIs that true?
p275
aa(lp276
VCA: I mean, let's hope.
p277
aVBut I think in this regard that so much of it is also about technology,
p278
aVthat the technology has to also be given some kind of moral compass.
p279
aVI know I'm talking nonsense, but you know what I mean.
p280
aa(lp281
VCH: We need a filter-the-crap algorithm with a moral compass \u2014
p282
aa(lp283
VCA: There you go.
p284
aa(lp285
VCH: I think that's good.
p286
aa(lp287
VCA: No \u2014 "moral technology."
p288
aVWe all have moral compasses \u2014 moral technology.
p289
aa(lp290
VCH: I think that's a great challenge. CA: You know what I mean.
p291
aa(lp292
VCH: Talk just a minute about leadership.
p293
aVYou've had a chance to speak with so many people across the world.
p294
aVI think for some of us \u2014
p295
aVI speak for myself, I don't know if others feel this \u2014
p296
aVthere's kind of been a disappointment of:
p297
aVWhere are the leaders?
p298
aVSo many of us have been disappointed \u2014
p299
aVAung San Suu Kyi, what's happened recently,
p300
aVit's like, "No! Another one bites the dust."
p301
aVYou know, it's heartbreaking.
p302
aa(lp303
V(Laughter)
p304
aa(lp305
VWho have you met
p306
aVwho you have been impressed by, inspired by?
p307
aa(lp308
VCA: Well, you talk about the world in crisis,
p309
aVwhich is absolutely true,
p310
aVand those of us who spend our whole lives immersed in this crisis \u2014
p311
aVI mean, we're all on the verge of a nervous breakdown.
p312
aVSo it's pretty stressful right now.
p313
aVAnd you're right \u2014
p314
aVthere is this perceived and actual vacuum of leadership,
p315
aVand it's not me saying it, I ask all these \u2014
p316
aVwhoever I'm talking to, I ask about leadership.
p317
aVI was speaking to the outgoing president of Liberia today,
p318
aV[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf,]
p319
aVwho \u2014
p320
aa(lp321
V(Applause)
p322
aa(lp323
Vin three weeks' time,
p324
aVwill be one of the very rare heads of an African country
p325
aVwho actually abides by the constitution
p326
aVand gives up power after her prescribed term.
p327
aVShe has said she wants to do that as a lesson.
p328
aVBut when I asked her about leadership,
p329
aVand I gave a quick-fire round of certain names,
p330
aVI presented her with the name of the new French president,
p331
aVEmmanuel Macron.
p332
aVAnd she said \u2014
p333
aVI said, "So what do you think when I say his name?"
p334
aVAnd she said,
p335
aV"Shaping up potentially to be
p336
aVa leader to fill our current leadership vacuum."
p337
aVI thought that was really interesting.
p338
aVYesterday, I happened to have an interview with him.
p339
aVI'm very proud to say,
p340
aVI got his first international interview. It was great. It was yesterday.
p341
aVAnd I was really impressed.
p342
aVI don't know whether I should be saying that in an open forum,
p343
aVbut I was really impressed.
p344
aa(lp345
V(Laughter)
p346
aa(lp347
VAnd it could be just because it was his first interview,
p348
aVbut \u2014 I asked questions, and you know what?
p349
aVHe answered them!
p350
aa(lp351
V(Laughter)
p352
aa(lp353
V(Applause)
p354
aa(lp355
VThere was no spin,
p356
aVthere was no wiggle and waggle,
p357
aVthere was no spend-five-minutes- to-come-back-to-the-point.
p358
aVI didn't have to keep interrupting,
p359
aVwhich I've become rather renowned for doing,
p360
aVbecause I want people to answer the question.
p361
aVAnd he answered me,
p362
aVand it was pretty interesting.
p363
aVAnd he said \u2014
p364
aa(lp365
VCH: Tell me what he said.
p366
aa(lp367
VCA: No, no, you go ahead.
p368
aa(lp369
VCH: You're the interrupter, I'm the listener.
p370
aa(lp371
VCA: No, no, go ahead.
p372
aa(lp373
VCH: What'd he say?
p374
aa(lp375
VCA: OK. You've talked about nationalism and tribalism here today.
p376
aVI asked him, "How did you have the guts to confront the prevailing winds
p377
aVof anti-globalization, nationalism, populism
p378
aVwhen you can see what happened in Brexit,
p379
aVwhen you could see what happened in the United States
p380
aVand what might have happened in many European elections
p381
aVat the beginning of 2017?"
p382
aVAnd he said,
p383
aV"For me, nationalism means war.
p384
aVWe have seen it before,
p385
aVwe have lived through it before on my continent,
p386
aVand I am very clear about that."
p387
aVSo he was not going to, just for political expediency,
p388
aVembrace the, kind of, lowest common denominator
p389
aVthat had been embraced in other political elections.
p390
aVAnd he stood against Marine Le Pen, who is a very dangerous woman.
p391
aa(lp392
VCH: Last question for you, Christiane.
p393
aVTell us about ideas worth spreading.
p394
aVIf you could plant one idea into the minds of everyone here,
p395
aVwhat would that be?
p396
aa(lp397
VCA: I would say really be careful where you get your information from;
p398
aVreally take responsibility for what you read, listen to and watch;
p399
aVmake sure that you go to the trusted brands to get your main information,
p400
aVno matter whether you have a wide, eclectic intake,
p401
aVreally stick with the brand names that you know,
p402
aVbecause in this world right now, at this moment right now,
p403
aVour crises, our challenges, our problems are so severe,
p404
aVthat unless we are all engaged as global citizens
p405
aVwho appreciate the truth,
p406
aVwho understand science, empirical evidence and facts,
p407
aVthen we are just simply going to be wandering along
p408
aVto a potential catastrophe.
p409
aa(lp410
VSo I would say, the truth,
p411
aVand then I would come back to Emmanuel Macron
p412
aVand talk about love.
p413
aVI would say that there's not enough love going around.
p414
aVAnd I asked him to tell me about love.
p415
aVI said, "You know, your marriage is the subject of global obsession."
p416
aa(lp417
V(Laughter)
p418
aa(lp419
V"Can you tell me about love?
p420
aVWhat does it mean to you?"
p421
aVI've never asked a president or an elected leader about love.
p422
aVI thought I'd try it.
p423
aVAnd he said \u2014 you know, he actually answered it.
p424
aVAnd he said, "I love my wife, she is part of me,
p425
aVwe've been together for decades."
p426
aVBut here's where it really counted,
p427
aVwhat really stuck with me.
p428
aVHe said,
p429
aV"It is so important for me to have somebody at home
p430
aVwho tells me the truth."
p431
aa(lp432
VSo you see, I brought it home. It's all about the truth.
p433
aa(lp434
V(Laughter)
p435
aa(lp436
VCH: So there you go. Truth and love. Ideas worth spreading.
p437
aa(lp438
VChristiane Amanpour, thank you so much. That was great.
p439
aa(lp440
V(Applause)

aa(lp442
