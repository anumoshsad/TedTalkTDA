VI am failing as a woman,
p4
aVI am failing as a feminist.
p5
aa(lp6
VI have passionate opinions about gender equality,
p7
aVbut I worry that to freely accept the label of "feminist,"
p8
aVwould not be fair to good feminists.
p9
aa(lp10
VI'm a feminist, but I'm a rather bad one.
p11
aVOh, so I call myself a Bad Feminist.
p12
aVOr at least, I wrote an essay,
p13
aVand then I wrote a book called "Bad Feminist,"
p14
aVand then in interviews, people started calling me The Bad Feminist.
p15
aV(Laughter)
p16
aa(lp17
VSo, what started as a bit of an inside joke with myself
p18
aVand a willful provocation,
p19
aVhas become a thing.
p20
aa(lp21
VLet me take a step back.
p22
aVWhen I was younger,
p23
aVmostly in my teens and 20s,
p24
aVI had strange ideas about feminists
p25
aVas hairy, angry, man-hating, sex-hating women \u2014
p26
aVas if those are bad things.
p27
aV(Laughter)
p28
aVThese days, I look at how women are treated the world over,
p29
aVand anger, in particular, seems like a perfectly reasonable response.
p30
aa(lp31
VBut back then,
p32
aVI worried about the tone people used
p33
aVwhen suggesting I might be a feminist.
p34
aVThe feminist label was an accusation,
p35
aVit was an "F" word, and not a nice one.
p36
aVI was labeled a woman who doesn't play by the rules,
p37
aVwho expects too much,
p38
aVwho thinks far too highly of myself,
p39
aVby daring to believe I'm equal \u2014 (Coughs) \u2014 superior to a man.
p40
aVYou don't want to be that rebel woman,
p41
aVuntil you realize that you very much are that woman,
p42
aVand cannot imagine being anyone else.
p43
aa(lp44
VAs I got older, I began to accept
p45
aVthat I am, indeed, a feminist, and a proud one.
p46
aVI hold certain truths to be self-evident:
p47
aVWomen are equal to men.
p48
aVWe deserve equal pay for equal work.
p49
aVWe have the right to move through the world as we choose,
p50
aVfree from harassment or violence.
p51
aVWe have the right to easy, affordable access to birth control,
p52
aVand reproductive services.
p53
aVWe have the right to make choices about our bodies,
p54
aVfree from legislative oversight or evangelical doctrine.
p55
aVWe have the right to respect.
p56
aa(lp57
VThere's more.
p58
aVWhen we talk about the needs of women,
p59
aVwe have to consider the other identities we inhabit.
p60
aVWe are not just women.
p61
aVWe are people with different bodies,
p62
aVgender expressions, faiths, sexualities,
p63
aVclass backgrounds, abilities, and so much more.
p64
aVWe need to take into account
p65
aVthese differences and how they affect us,
p66
aVas much as we account for what we have in common.
p67
aVWithout this kind of inclusion, our feminism is nothing.
p68
aa(lp69
VI hold these truths to be self-evident, but let me be clear:
p70
aVI'm a mess.
p71
aVI am full of contradictions.
p72
aVThere are many ways in which I'm doing feminism wrong.
p73
aa(lp74
VI have another confession.
p75
aVWhen I drive to work, I listen to thuggish rap at a very loud volume.
p76
aV(Laughter)
p77
aVEven though the lyrics are degrading to women \u2014
p78
aVthese lyrics offend me to my core \u2014
p79
aVthe classic Yin Yang Twins song "Salt Shaker" \u2014
p80
aVit is amazing.
p81
aV(Laughter)
p82
aV"Make it work with your wet t-shirt.
p83
aVBitch, you gotta shake it 'til your camel starts to hurt!"
p84
aV(Laughter)
p85
aVThink about it.
p86
aV(Laughter)
p87
aVPoetry, right?
p88
aVI am utterly mortified by my music choices.
p89
aV(Laughter)
p90
aa(lp91
VI firmly believe in man work,
p92
aVwhich is anything I don't want to do, including \u2014
p93
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p94
aVall domestic tasks,
p95
aVbut also: bug killing, trash removal, lawn care and vehicle maintenance.
p96
aVI want no part of any of that.
p97
aV(Laughter)
p98
aVPink is my favorite color.
p99
aVI enjoy fashion magazines and pretty things.
p100
aVI watch "The Bachelor" and romantic comedies,
p101
aVand I have absurd fantasies about fairy tales coming true.
p102
aa(lp103
VSome of my transgressions are more flagrant.
p104
aVIf a woman wants to take her husband's name,
p105
aVthat is her choice, and it is not my place to judge.
p106
aVIf a woman chooses to stay home to raise her children,
p107
aVI embrace that choice, too.
p108
aVThe problem is not that she makes herself economically vulnerable in that choice;
p109
aVthe problem is that our society is set up
p110
aVto make women economically vulnerable when they choose.
p111
aVLet's deal with that.
p112
aV(Applause)
p113
aa(lp114
VI reject the mainstream feminism
p115
aVthat has historically ignored or deflected the needs
p116
aVof women of color, working-class women, queer women and transgender women,
p117
aVin favor of supporting white, middle- and upper-class straight women.
p118
aVListen, if that's good feminism \u2014 I am a very bad feminist.
p119
aV(Laughter)
p120
aa(lp121
VThere is also this:
p122
aVAs a feminist, I feel a lot of pressure.
p123
aVWe have this tendency to put visible feminists on a pedestal.
p124
aVWe expect them to pose perfectly.
p125
aVWhen they disappoint us,
p126
aVwe gleefully knock them from the very pedestal we put them on.
p127
aVLike I said, I am a mess \u2014
p128
aVconsider me knocked off that pedestal
p129
aVbefore you ever try to put me up there.
p130
aV(Laughter)
p131
aa(lp132
VToo many women,
p133
aVparticularly groundbreaking women and industry leaders,
p134
aVare afraid to be labeled as feminists.
p135
aVThey're afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I am a feminist,"
p136
aVfor fear of what that label means,
p137
aVfor fear of being unable to live up to unrealistic expectations.
p138
aa(lp139
VTake, for example, Beyoncé, or as I call her, The Goddess.
p140
aV(Laughter)
p141
aVShe has emerged, in recent years, as a visible feminist.
p142
aVAt the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards,
p143
aVshe performed in front of the word "feminist" 10 feet high.
p144
aVIt was a glorious spectacle to see
p145
aVthis pop star openly embracing feminism
p146
aVand letting young women and men know
p147
aVthat being a feminist is something to celebrate.
p148
aVAs the moment faded, cultural critics began endlessly debating
p149
aVwhether or not Beyoncé was, indeed, a feminist.
p150
aVThey graded her feminism,
p151
aVinstead of simply taking a grown, accomplished woman at her word.
p152
aV(Laughter)
p153
aV(Applause)
p154
aa(lp155
VWe demand perfection from feminists,
p156
aVbecause we are still fighting for so much,
p157
aVwe want so much,
p158
aVwe need so damn much.
p159
aa(lp160
VWe go far beyond reasonable, constructive criticism,
p161
aVto dissecting any given woman's feminism,
p162
aVtearing it apart until there's nothing left.
p163
aVWe do not need to do that.
p164
aVBad feminism \u2014 or really, more inclusive feminism \u2014 is a starting point.
p165
aa(lp166
VBut what happens next?
p167
aVWe go from acknowledging our imperfections to accountability,
p168
aVor walking the walk, and being a little bit brave.
p169
aVIf I listen to degrading music,
p170
aVI am creating a demand for which artists are more than happy
p171
aVto contribute a limitless supply.
p172
aVThese artists are not going to change
p173
aVhow they talk about women in their songs
p174
aVuntil we demand that change by affecting their bottom line.
p175
aVCertainly, it is difficult.
p176
aVWhy must it be so catchy?
p177
aV(Laughter)
p178
aVIt's hard to make the better choice,
p179
aVand it is so easy to justify a lesser one.
p180
aVBut \u2014
p181
aVwhen I justify bad choices,
p182
aVI make it harder for women to achieve equality,
p183
aVthe equality that we all deserve,
p184
aVand I need to own that.
p185
aa(lp186
VI think of my nieces, ages three and four.
p187
aVThey are gorgeous and headstrong, brilliant girls,
p188
aVwho are a whole lot of brave.
p189
aVI want them to thrive in a world where they are valued
p190
aVfor the powerful creatures they are.
p191
aVI think of them,
p192
aVand suddenly, the better choice becomes far easier to make.
p193
aa(lp194
VWe can all make better choices.
p195
aVWe can change the channel when a television show
p196
aVtreats sexual violence against women like sport,
p197
aVGame of Thrones.
p198
aVWe can change the radio station
p199
aVwhen we hear songs that treat women as nothing.
p200
aVWe can spend our box office dollars elsewhere
p201
aVwhen movies don't treat women
p202
aVas anything more than decorative objects.
p203
aVWe can stop supporting professional sports
p204
aVwhere the athletes treat  their partners like punching bags.
p205
aV(Applause)
p206
aa(lp207
VIn other ways, men \u2014 and especially straight white men \u2014
p208
aVcan say, "No, I will not publish with your magazine,
p209
aVor participate in your project, or otherwise work with you,
p210
aVuntil you include a fair number of women,
p211
aVboth as participants and decision makers.
p212
aVI won't work with you until your publication,
p213
aVor your organization, is more inclusive of all kinds of difference."
p214
aa(lp215
VThose of us who are underrepresented
p216
aVand invited to participate in such projects,
p217
aVcan also decline to be included
p218
aVuntil more of us are invited through the glass ceiling,
p219
aVand we are tokens no more.
p220
aa(lp221
VWithout these efforts,
p222
aVwithout taking these stands,
p223
aVour accomplishments are going to mean very little.
p224
aVWe can commit these small acts of bravery
p225
aVand hope that our choices trickle upward to the people in power \u2014
p226
aVeditors, movie and music producers,
p227
aVCEOs, lawmakers \u2014
p228
aVthe people who can make bigger, braver choices
p229
aVto create lasting, meaningful change.
p230
aa(lp231
VWe can also boldly claim our feminism \u2014
p232
aVgood, bad, or anywhere in between.
p233
aVThe last line of my book "Bad Feminist" says,
p234
aV"I would rather be a bad feminist than no feminist at all."
p235
aVThis is true for so many reasons,
p236
aVbut first and foremost, I say this because once upon a time,
p237
aVmy voice was stolen from me,
p238
aVand feminism helped me to get my voice back.
p239
aa(lp240
VThere was an incident.
p241
aVI call it an incident so I can carry the burden of what happened.
p242
aVSome boys broke me,
p243
aVwhen I was so young, I did not know
p244
aVwhat boys can do to break a girl.
p245
aVThey treated me like I was nothing.
p246
aVI began to believe I was nothing.
p247
aVThey stole my voice, and in the after,
p248
aVI did not dare to believe
p249
aVthat anything I might say could matter.
p250
aa(lp251
VBut \u2014
p252
aVI had writing.
p253
aVAnd there, I wrote myself back together.
p254
aVI wrote myself toward a stronger version of myself.
p255
aVI read the words of women
p256
aVwho might understand a story like mine,
p257
aVand women who looked like me,
p258
aVand understood what it was like to move through the world with brown skin.
p259
aVI read the words of women who showed me I was not nothing.
p260
aVI learned to write like them,
p261
aVand then I learned to write as myself.
p262
aVI found my voice again,
p263
aVand I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond measure.
p264
aa(lp265
VThrough writing and feminism,
p266
aVI also found that if I was a little bit brave,
p267
aVanother woman might hear me and see me and recognize
p268
aVthat none of us are the nothing the world tries to tell us we are.
p269
aa(lp270
VIn one hand,
p271
aVI hold the power to accomplish anything.
p272
aVAnd in my other,
p273
aVI hold the humbling reality that I am just one woman.
p274
aa(lp275
VI am a bad feminist,
p276
aVI am a good woman,
p277
aVI am trying to become better in how I think,
p278
aVand what I say, and what I do,
p279
aVwithout abandoning everything that makes me human.
p280
aVI hope that we can all do the same.
p281
aVI hope that we can all be a little bit brave,
p282
aVwhen we most need such bravery.
