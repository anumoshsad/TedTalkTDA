VAn article in the Yale Alumni Magazine
p4
aVtold the story of Clyde Murphy,
p5
aVa black man who was a member of the Class of 1970.
p6
aVClyde was a success story.
p7
aVAfter Yale and a law degree from Columbia,
p8
aVClyde spent the next 30 years
p9
aVas one of America's top civil rights lawyers.
p10
aVHe was also a great husband and father.
p11
aVBut despite his success,
p12
aVpersonally and professionally,
p13
aVClyde's story had a sad ending.
p14
aa(lp15
VIn 2010,
p16
aVat the age of 62,
p17
aVClyde died from a blood clot in his lung.
p18
aVClyde's experience was not unique.
p19
aVMany of his black classmates from Yale
p20
aValso died young.
p21
aVIn fact, the magazine article indicated
p22
aVthat 41 years after graduation from Yale,
p23
aVthe black members of the Class of 1970
p24
aVhad a death rate that was three times higher
p25
aVthan that of the average class member.
p26
aVIt's stunning.
p27
aa(lp28
VAmerica has recently awakened
p29
aVto a steady drumbeat
p30
aVof unarmed black men being shot by the police.
p31
aVWhat is even a bigger story
p32
aVis that every seven minutes,
p33
aVa black person dies prematurely in the United States.
p34
aVThat is over 200 black people
p35
aVdie every single day
p36
aVwho would not die if the health of blacks and whites were equal.
p37
aa(lp38
VFor the last 25 years,
p39
aVI have been on a mission
p40
aVto understand why does race
p41
aVmatter so profoundly for health.
p42
aVWhen I started my career,
p43
aVmany believed that it was simply about racial differences
p44
aVin income and education.
p45
aVI discovered that while economic status matters for health,
p46
aVthere is more to the story.
p47
aVSo for example, if we look at life expectancy at age 25,
p48
aVat age 25 there's a five-year gap between blacks and whites.
p49
aVAnd the gap by education for both whites and blacks
p50
aVis even larger than the racial gap.
p51
aVAt the same time, at every level of education,
p52
aVwhites live longer than blacks.
p53
aVSo whites who are high school dropouts
p54
aVlive 3.4 years longer than their black counterparts,
p55
aVand the gap is even larger
p56
aVamong college graduates.
p57
aVMost surprising of all,
p58
aVwhites who have graduated from high school
p59
aVlive longer than blacks with a college degree
p60
aVor more education.
p61
aa(lp62
VSo why does race matter so profoundly for health?
p63
aVWhat else is it beyond education and income
p64
aVthat might matter?
p65
aa(lp66
VIn the early 1990s,
p67
aVI was asked to review a new book
p68
aVon the health of black America.
p69
aVI was struck that almost every single one
p70
aVof its 25 chapters
p71
aVsaid that racism
p72
aVwas a factor that was hurting the health of blacks.
p73
aVAll of these researchers
p74
aVwere stating that racism was a factor adversely impacting blacks,
p75
aVbut they provided no evidence.
p76
aVFor me, that was not good enough.
p77
aa(lp78
VA few months later,
p79
aVI was speaking at a conference in Washington, DC,
p80
aVand I said that one of the priorities for research
p81
aVwas to document the ways in which racism affected health.
p82
aVA white gentleman stood in the audience
p83
aVand said that while he agreed with me that racism was important,
p84
aVwe could never measure racism.
p85
aV"We measure self-esteem," I said.
p86
aV"There's no reason
p87
aVwhy we can't measure racism if we put our minds to it."
p88
aa(lp89
VAnd so I put my mind to it
p90
aVand developed three scales.
p91
aVThe first one captured major experiences of discrimination,
p92
aVlike being unfairly fired or being unfairly stopped by the police.
p93
aVBut discrimination also occurs in more minor and subtle experiences,
p94
aVand so my second scale, called the Everyday Discrimination Scale,
p95
aVcaptures nine items
p96
aVthat captures experiences
p97
aVlike you're treated with less courtesy than others,
p98
aVyou receive poorer service than others in restaurants or stores,
p99
aVor people act as if they're afraid of you.
p100
aVThis scale captures
p101
aVways in which the dignity and the respect
p102
aVof people who society does not value
p103
aVis chipped away on a daily basis.
p104
aa(lp105
VResearch has found
p106
aVthat higher levels of discrimination
p107
aVare associated with an elevated risk of a broad range of diseases
p108
aVfrom blood pressure to abdominal obesity
p109
aVto breast cancer to heart disease
p110
aVand even premature mortality.
p111
aVStrikingly, some of the effects are observed at a very young age.
p112
aVFor example, a study of black teens
p113
aVfound that those who reported higher levels of discrimination as teenagers
p114
aVhad higher levels of stress hormones,
p115
aVof blood pressure
p116
aVand of weight at age 20.
p117
aVHowever,
p118
aVthe stress of discrimination
p119
aVis only one aspect.
p120
aa(lp121
VDiscrimination and racism
p122
aValso matters in other profound ways for health.
p123
aVFor example, there's discrimination in medical care.
p124
aVIn 1999, the National Academy of Medicine
p125
aVasked me to serve on a committee
p126
aVthat found, concluded based on the scientific evidence,
p127
aVthat blacks and other minorities
p128
aVreceive poorer quality care than whites.
p129
aVThis was true for all kinds of medical treatment,
p130
aVfrom the most simple
p131
aVto the most technologically sophisticated.
p132
aVOne explanation for this pattern
p133
aVwas a phenomenon that's called "implicit bias"
p134
aVor "unconscious discrimination."
p135
aVResearch for decades by social psychologists
p136
aVindicates that if you hold a negative stereotype
p137
aVabout a group in your subconscious mind
p138
aVand you meet someone from that group,
p139
aVyou will discriminate against that person.
p140
aVYou will treat them differently.
p141
aVIt's an unconscious process. It's an automatic process.
p142
aVIt is a subtle process, but it's normal
p143
aVand it occurs even among the most well-intentioned individuals.
p144
aa(lp145
VBut the deeper that I delved
p146
aVinto the health impact of racism,
p147
aVthe more insidious the effects became.
p148
aVThere is institutional discrimination,
p149
aVwhich refers to discrimination
p150
aVthat exists in the processes of social institutions.
p151
aVResidential segregation by race,
p152
aVwhich has led to blacks and whites living in very different neighborhood contexts,
p153
aVis a classic example of institutional racism.
p154
aVOne of America's best-kept secrets
p155
aVis how residential segregation
p156
aVis the secret source
p157
aVthat creates racial inequality in the United States.
p158
aVIn America, where you live
p159
aVdetermines your access to opportunities
p160
aVin education, in employment,
p161
aVin housing and even in access to medical care.
p162
aVOne study of the 171 largest cities in the United States
p163
aVconcluded that there is not even one city
p164
aVwhere whites live under equal conditions to blacks,
p165
aVand that the worst urban contexts in which whites reside
p166
aVis considerably better than the average context of black communities.
p167
aVAnother study found
p168
aVthat if you could eliminate statistically
p169
aVresidential segregation,
p170
aVyou would completely erase black-white differences in income,
p171
aVeducation and unemployment,
p172
aVand reduce black-white differences in single motherhood
p173
aVby two thirds,
p174
aVall of that driven by segregation.
p175
aVI have also learned
p176
aVhow the negative stereotypes
p177
aVand images of blacks in our culture
p178
aVliterally create and sustain
p179
aVboth institutional and individual discrimination.
p180
aa(lp181
VA group of researchers have put together a database
p182
aVthat contains the books,
p183
aVmagazines and articles
p184
aVthat an average college-educated American would read over their lifetime.
p185
aVIt allows us to look within this database
p186
aVand see how Americans have seen words paired together
p187
aVas they grow up in their society.
p188
aVSo when the word "black" appears in American culture,
p189
aVwhat co-occurs with it?
p190
aV"Poor,"
p191
aV"violent,"
p192
aV"religious,"
p193
aV"lazy,"
p194
aV"cheerful,"
p195
aV"dangerous."
p196
aVWhen "white" occurs,
p197
aVthe frequently co-occurring words
p198
aVare "wealthy,"
p199
aV"progressive,"
p200
aV"conventional,"
p201
aV"stubborn,"
p202
aV"successful,"
p203
aV"educated."
p204
aVSo when a police officer
p205
aVoverreacts when he sees an unarmed black male
p206
aVand perceives him to be violent and dangerous,
p207
aVwe are not necessarily dealing with an inherently bad cop.
p208
aVWe may be simply viewing
p209
aVa normal American
p210
aVwho is reflecting what he has been exposed to
p211
aVas a result of being raised
p212
aVin this society.
p213
aa(lp214
VFrom my own experience,
p215
aVI believe that your race
p216
aVdoes not have to be a determinant of your destiny.
p217
aVI migrated to the United States
p218
aVfrom the Caribbean island of Saint Lucia
p219
aVin the late 1970s
p220
aVin pursuit of higher education,
p221
aVand in the last 40 years,
p222
aVI have done well.
p223
aVI have had a supportive family,
p224
aVI have worked hard,
p225
aVI have done well.
p226
aVBut it took more for me to be successful.
p227
aVI received a minority fellowship from the University of Michigan.
p228
aVYes. I am an affirmative action baby.
p229
aVWithout affirmative action,
p230
aVI would not be here.
p231
aa(lp232
VBut in the last 40 years,
p233
aVblack America has been less successful than I have.
p234
aVIn 1978, black households in the United States
p235
aVearned 59 cents for every dollar of income whites earned.
p236
aVIn 2015,
p237
aVblack families still earn 59 cents
p238
aVfor every dollar of income that white families receive,
p239
aVand the racial gaps in wealth are even more stunning.
p240
aVFor every dollar of wealth that whites have,
p241
aVblack families have six pennies and Latinos have seven pennies.
p242
aa(lp243
VThe fact is,
p244
aVracism
p245
aVis producing a truly rigged system
p246
aVthat is systematically disadvantaging some racial groups in the United States.
p247
aVTo paraphrase Plato,
p248
aVthere is nothing so unfair
p249
aVas the equal treatment of unequal people.
p250
aVAnd that's why I am committed
p251
aVto working to dismantle racism.
p252
aa(lp253
VI deeply appreciate the fact
p254
aVthat I am standing on the shoulders
p255
aVof those who have sacrificed even their lives to open the doors
p256
aVthat I have walked through.
p257
aVI want to ensure that those doors remain open
p258
aVand that everyone can walk through those doors.
p259
aVRobert Kennedy said,
p260
aV"Each time a man" \u2014 or woman, I would add \u2014
p261
aV"stands up for an ideal
p262
aVor acts to improve the lot of others
p263
aVor strikes out against injustice,
p264
aVhe sends forth a tiny ripple of hope,
p265
aVand those ripples can build a current
p266
aVthat can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance."
p267
aa(lp268
VI am optimistic today
p269
aVbecause all across America,
p270
aVI have seen ripples of hope.
p271
aVThe Boston Medical Center
p272
aVhas added lawyers to the medical team
p273
aVso that physicians can improve the health of their patients
p274
aVbecause the lawyers are addressing the nonmedical needs their patients have.
p275
aVLoma Linda University has built a gateway college
p276
aVin nearby San Bernardino
p277
aVso that in addition to delivering medical care,
p278
aVthey can provide job skills
p279
aVand job training
p280
aVto a predominantly minority, low-income community members
p281
aVso that they will have the skills they need to get a decent job.
p282
aVIn Chapel Hill, North Carolina,
p283
aVthe Abecedarian Project has figured out
p284
aVhow to ensure that they have lowered the risks for heart disease
p285
aVfor blacks in their mid-30s
p286
aVby providing high-quality day care
p287
aVfrom birth to age five.
p288
aVIn after-school centers across the United States,
p289
aVWintley Phipps and the US Dream Academy
p290
aVis breaking the cycle of incarceration
p291
aVby providing high-quality academic enrichment and mentoring
p292
aVto the children of prisoners
p293
aVand children who have fallen behind in school.
p294
aVIn Huntsville, Alabama,
p295
aVOakwood University,
p296
aVa historically black institution,
p297
aVis showing how we can improve the health of black adults
p298
aVby including a health evaluation
p299
aVas a part of freshman orientation
p300
aVand giving those students the tools they need
p301
aVto make healthy choices
p302
aVand providing them annually a health transcript
p303
aVso they can monitor their progress.
p304
aVAnd in Atlanta, Georgia,
p305
aVPurpose Built Communities has dismantled the negative effects of segregation
p306
aVby transforming a crime-ridden,
p307
aVdrug-infested public housing project
p308
aVinto an oasis of mixed-income housing,
p309
aVof academic performance,
p310
aVof great community wellness
p311
aVand of full employment.
p312
aVAnd finally,
p313
aVthere is the Devine solution.
p314
aVProfessor Patricia Devine
p315
aVof the University of Wisconsin
p316
aVhas shown us how we can attack
p317
aVour hidden biases head on
p318
aVand effectively reduce them.
p319
aVEach one of us
p320
aVcan be a ripple of hope.
p321
aa(lp322
VThis work will not always be easy,
p323
aVbut former Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall
p324
aVhas told us, "We must dissent.
p325
aVWe must dissent from the indifference.
p326
aVWe must dissent from the apathy.
p327
aVWe must dissent from the hatred and from the mistrust.
p328
aVWe must dissent
p329
aVbecause America can do better,
p330
aVbecause America has no choice but to do better."
p331
