VI have a confession to make.
p4
aVAs a scientist and engineer, I've focused on efficiency for many years.
p5
aVBut efficiency can be a cult,
p6
aVand today I'd like to tell you about a journey
p7
aVthat moved me out of the cult and back to a far richer reality.
p8
aa(lp9
VA few years ago, after finishing my Ph.D.  in London, I moved to Boston.
p10
aVI lived in Boston and worked in Cambridge.
p11
aVI bought a racing bicycle that summer,
p12
aVand I bicycled every day to work.
p13
aVTo find my way, I used my phone.
p14
aVIt sent me over Mass. Ave., Massachusetts Avenue,
p15
aVthe shortest route from Boston to Cambridge.
p16
aVBut after a month
p17
aVthat I was cycling every day on the car-packed Mass. Ave.,
p18
aVI took a different route one day.
p19
aVI'm not entirely sure why I took a different route that day, a detour.
p20
aVI just remember a feeling of surprise;
p21
aVsurprise at finding a street with no cars,
p22
aVas opposed to the nearby Mass. Ave. full of cars;
p23
aVsurprise at finding a street  draped by leaves and surrounded by trees.
p24
aVBut after the feeling  of surprise, I felt shame.
p25
aVHow could I have been so blind?
p26
aVFor an entire month,
p27
aVI was so trapped in my mobile app
p28
aVthat a journey to work became one thing only:
p29
aVthe shortest path.
p30
aVIn this single journey, there was no thought
p31
aVof enjoying the road,
p32
aVno pleasure in connecting with nature,
p33
aVno possibility of looking people in the eyes.
p34
aVAnd why?
p35
aVBecause I was saving a minute out of my commute.
p36
aa(lp37
VNow let me ask you: Am I alone here?
p38
aVHow many of you have never used a mapping app for finding directions?
p39
aVMost of you, if not all, have.
p40
aVAnd don't get me wrong \u2014 mapping apps are the greatest game-changer
p41
aVfor encouraging people to explore the city.
p42
aVYou take your phone out and you know immediately where to go.
p43
aVHowever, the app also assumes
p44
aVthere are only a handful of directions to the destination.
p45
aVIt has the power to make those handful of directions
p46
aVthe definitive direction to that destination.
p47
aa(lp48
VAfter that experience, I changed.
p49
aVI changed my research from traditional data-mining
p50
aVto understanding how people experience the city.
p51
aVI used computer science tools
p52
aVto replicate social science experiments at scale, at web scale.
p53
aVI became captivated by the beauty and genius
p54
aVof traditional social science experiments
p55
aVdone by Jane Jacobs, Stanley Milgram, Kevin Lynch.
p56
aVThe result of that research has been the creation of new maps,
p57
aVmaps where you don't only find the shortest path, the blue one,
p58
aVbut also the most enjoyable path,
p59
aVthe red one.
p60
aVHow was that possible?
p61
aa(lp62
VEinstein once said,
p63
aV"Logic will get you from A to B.
p64
aVImagination will take you everywhere."
p65
aVSo with a bit of imagination,
p66
aVwe needed to understand
p67
aVwhich parts of the city people find beautiful.
p68
aVAt the University of Cambridge, with colleagues,
p69
aVwe thought about this simple experiment.
p70
aVIf I were to show you these two urban scenes,
p71
aVand I were to ask you which one is more beautiful,
p72
aVwhich one would you say?
p73
aVDon't be shy.
p74
aVWho says A? Who says B?
p75
aVBrilliant.
p76
aVBased on that idea,
p77
aVwe built a crowdsourcing platform,
p78
aVa web game.
p79
aVPlayers are shown pairs of urban scenes,
p80
aVand they're asked to choose which one  is more beautiful, quiet and happy.
p81
aVBased on thousands of user votes,
p82
aVthen we are able to see where consensus emerges.
p83
aVWe are able to see which are the urban scenes
p84
aVthat make people happy.
p85
aa(lp86
VAfter that work, I joined Yahoo Labs,
p87
aVand I teamed up with Luca and Rossano,
p88
aVand together, we aggregated those winning locations in London
p89
aVto build a new map of the city,
p90
aVa cartography weighted for human emotions.
p91
aVOn this cartography, you're not only able to see and connect
p92
aVfrom point A to point B  the shortest segments,
p93
aVbut you're also able to see the happy segment,
p94
aVthe beautiful path, the quiet path.
p95
aVIn tests, participants found the happy, the beautiful, the quiet path
p96
aVfar more enjoyable than the shortest one,
p97
aVand that just by adding a few minutes to travel time.
p98
aVParticipants also love to attach memories to places.
p99
aVShared memories \u2014 that's where the old BBC building was;
p100
aVand personal memories \u2014 that's where I gave my first kiss.
p101
aVThey also recalled how some paths smelled and sounded.
p102
aVSo what if we had a mapping tool
p103
aVthat would return the most enjoyable routes
p104
aVbased not only on aesthetics
p105
aVbut also based on smell, sound,  and memories?
p106
aVThat's where our research is going right now.
p107
aVMore generally, my research,
p108
aVwhat it tries to do is avoid the danger of the single path,
p109
aVto avoid robbing people of fully experiencing the city in which they live.
p110
aVWalk the path through the park, not through the car park,
p111
aVand you have an entirely different path.
p112
aVWalk the path full of people you love
p113
aVand not full of cars,
p114
aVand you have an entirely different path.
p115
aVIt's that simple.
p116
aa(lp117
VI would like to end with this thought:
p118
aVdo you remember "The Truman Show?"
p119
aVIt's a media satire in which a real person
p120
aVdoesn't know he's living in a fabricated world.
p121
aVPerhaps we live in a world fabricated for efficiency.
p122
aVLook at some of your daily habits,
p123
aVand as Truman did in the movie, escape the fabricated world.
p124
aVWhy?
p125
aVWell, if you think that adventure is dangerous, try routine. It's deadly.
p126
aa(lp127
VThank you.
