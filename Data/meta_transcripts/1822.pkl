VThis is our life with bees,
p4
aVand this is our life without bees.
p5
aVBees are the most important pollinators
p6
aVof our fruits and vegetables and flowers
p7
aVand crops like alfalfa hay that feed our farm animals.
p8
aVMore than one third of the world's crop production
p9
aVis dependent on bee pollination.
p10
aa(lp11
VBut the ironic thing is that bees are not out there
p12
aVpollinating our food intentionally.
p13
aVThey're out there because they need to eat.
p14
aVBees get all of the protein they need in their diet
p15
aVfrom pollen
p16
aVand all of the carbohydrates they need from nectar.
p17
aVThey're flower-feeders,
p18
aVand as they move from flower to flower,
p19
aVbasically on a shopping trip at the local floral mart,
p20
aVthey end up providing this valuable pollination service.
p21
aVIn parts of the world where there are no bees,
p22
aVor where they plant varieties that are not attractive to bees,
p23
aVpeople are paid to do the business of pollination by hand.
p24
aVThese people are moving pollen from flower to flower
p25
aVwith a paintbrush.
p26
aVNow this business of hand pollination
p27
aVis actually not that uncommon.
p28
aVTomato growers often pollinate their tomato flowers
p29
aVwith a hand-held vibrator.
p30
aVNow this one's the tomato tickler. (Laughter)
p31
aVNow this is because the pollen within a tomato flower
p32
aVis held very securely within
p33
aVthe male part of the flower, the anther,
p34
aVand the only way to release this pollen is to vibrate it.
p35
aVSo bumblebees are one of the few kinds of bees in the world
p36
aVthat are able to hold onto the flower and vibrate it,
p37
aVand they do this by shaking their flight muscles
p38
aVat a frequency similar to the musical note C.
p39
aVSo they vibrate the flower, they sonicate it,
p40
aVand that releases the pollen in this efficient swoosh,
p41
aVand the pollen gathers all over the fuzzy bee's body,
p42
aVand she takes it home as food.
p43
aVTomato growers now put bumblebee colonies
p44
aVinside the greenhouse to pollinate the tomatoes
p45
aVbecause they get much more efficient pollination
p46
aVwhen it's done naturally
p47
aVand they get better quality tomatoes.
p48
aa(lp49
VSo there's other, maybe more personal reasons,
p50
aVto care about bees.
p51
aVThere's over 20,000 species of bees in the world,
p52
aVand they're absolutely gorgeous.
p53
aVThese bees spend the majority of their life cycle
p54
aVhidden in the ground or within a hollow stem
p55
aVand very few of these beautiful species
p56
aVhave evolved highly social behavior like honeybees.
p57
aa(lp58
VNow honeybees tend to be the charismatic representative
p59
aVfor the other 19,900-plus species
p60
aVbecause there's something about honeybees
p61
aVthat draws people into their world.
p62
aVHumans have been drawn to honeybees
p63
aVsince early recorded history,
p64
aVmostly to harvest their honey,
p65
aVwhich is an amazing natural sweetener.
p66
aa(lp67
VI got drawn into the honeybee world
p68
aVcompletely by a fluke.
p69
aVI was 18 years old and bored,
p70
aVand I picked up a book in the library on bees
p71
aVand I spent the night reading it.
p72
aVI had never thought about insects
p73
aVliving in complex societies.
p74
aVIt was like the best of science fiction come true.
p75
aVAnd even stranger, there were these people,
p76
aVthese beekeepers, that loved their bees like they were family,
p77
aVand when I put down the book, I knew I had to see this for myself.
p78
aVSo I went to work for a commercial beekeeper,
p79
aVa family that owned 2,000 hives of bees in New Mexico.
p80
aVAnd I was permanently hooked.
p81
aa(lp82
VHoneybees can be considered a super-organism,
p83
aVwhere the colony is the organism
p84
aVand it's comprised of 40,000 to 50,000
p85
aVindividual bee organisms.
p86
aVNow this society has no central authority.
p87
aVNobody's in charge.
p88
aVSo how they come to collective decisions,
p89
aVand how they allocate their tasks and divide their labor,
p90
aVhow they communicate where the flowers are,
p91
aVall of their collective social behaviors are mindblowing.
p92
aVMy personal favorite, and one that I've studied for many years,
p93
aVis their system of healthcare.
p94
aVSo bees have social healthcare.
p95
aVSo in my lab, we study how bees keep themselves healthy.
p96
aVFor example, we study hygiene,
p97
aVwhere some bees are able to locate and weed out
p98
aVsick individuals from the nest, from the colony,
p99
aVand it keeps the colony healthy.
p100
aVAnd more recently, we've been studying resins
p101
aVthat bees collect from plants.
p102
aVSo bees fly to some plants and they scrape
p103
aVthese very, very sticky resins off the leaves,
p104
aVand they take them back to the nest
p105
aVwhere they cement them into the nest architecture
p106
aVwhere we call it propolis.
p107
aVWe've found that propolis is a natural disinfectant.
p108
aVIt's a natural antibiotic.
p109
aVIt kills off bacteria and molds and other germs
p110
aVwithin the colony,
p111
aVand so it bolsters the colony health and their social immunity.
p112
aVHumans have known about the power of propolis
p113
aVsince biblical times.
p114
aVWe've been harvesting propolis out of bee colonies
p115
aVfor human medicine,
p116
aVbut we didn't know how good it was for the bees.
p117
aVSo honeybees have these remarkable natural defenses
p118
aVthat have kept them healthy and thriving
p119
aVfor over 50 million years.
p120
aa(lp121
VSo seven years ago, when honeybee colonies
p122
aVwere reported to be dying en masse,
p123
aVfirst in the United States,
p124
aVit was clear that there was something really, really wrong.
p125
aVIn our collective conscience, in a really primal way,
p126
aVwe know we can't afford to lose bees.
p127
aVSo what's going on?
p128
aVBees are dying from multiple and interacting causes,
p129
aVand I'll go through each of these.
p130
aVThe bottom line is,
p131
aVbees dying reflects a flowerless landscape
p132
aVand a dysfunctional food system.
p133
aa(lp134
VNow we have the best data on honeybees,
p135
aVso I'll use them as an example.
p136
aVIn the United States, bees in fact have been
p137
aVin decline since World War II.
p138
aVWe have half the number of managed hives
p139
aVin the United States now compared to 1945.
p140
aVWe're down to about two million hives of bees, we think.
p141
aVAnd the reason is, after World War II,
p142
aVwe changed our farming practices.
p143
aVWe stopped planting cover crops.
p144
aVWe stopped planting clover and alfalfa,
p145
aVwhich are natural fertilizers that fix nitrogen in the soil,
p146
aVand instead we started using synthetic fertilizers.
p147
aVClover and alfalfa are highly nutritious food plants for bees.
p148
aVAnd after World War II, we started using herbicides
p149
aVto kill off the weeds in our farms.
p150
aVMany of these weeds are flowering plants
p151
aVthat bees require for their survival.
p152
aVAnd we started growing larger and larger crop monocultures.
p153
aVNow we talk about food deserts,
p154
aVplaces in our cities, neighborhoods that have no grocery stores.
p155
aVThe very farms that used to sustain bees
p156
aVare now agricultural food deserts,
p157
aVdominated by one or two plant species
p158
aVlike corn and soybeans.
p159
aVSince World War II, we have been systematically
p160
aVeliminating many of the flowering plants
p161
aVthat bees need for their survival.
p162
aVAnd these monocultures extend even to crops
p163
aVthat are good for bees, like almonds.
p164
aVFifty years ago, beekeepers would take a few colonies,
p165
aVhives of bees into the almond orchards, for pollination,
p166
aVand also because the pollen in an almond blossom
p167
aVis really high in protein. It's really good for bees.
p168
aVNow, the scale of almond monoculture
p169
aVdemands that most of our nation's bees,
p170
aVover 1.5 million hives of bees,
p171
aVbe transported across the nation
p172
aVto pollinate this one crop.
p173
aVAnd they're trucked in in semi-loads,
p174
aVand they must be trucked out,
p175
aVbecause after bloom, the almond orchards
p176
aVare a vast and flowerless landscape.
p177
aa(lp178
VBees have been dying over the last 50 years,
p179
aVand we're planting more crops that need them.
p180
aVThere has been a 300 percent increase in crop production
p181
aVthat requires bee pollination.
p182
aa(lp183
VAnd then there's pesticides.
p184
aVAfter World War II, we started using pesticides
p185
aVon a large scale, and this became necessary
p186
aVbecause of the monocultures that put out a feast
p187
aVfor crop pests.
p188
aVRecently, researchers from Penn State University
p189
aVhave started looking at the pesticide residue
p190
aVin the loads of pollen that bees carry home as food,
p191
aVand they've found that every batch of pollen
p192
aVthat a honeybee collects
p193
aVhas at least six detectable pesticides in it,
p194
aVand this includes every class of insecticides,
p195
aVherbicides, fungicides,
p196
aVand even inert and unlabeled ingredients
p197
aVthat are part of the pesticide formulation
p198
aVthat can be more toxic than the active ingredient.
p199
aVThis small bee is holding up a large mirror.
p200
aVHow much is it going to take to contaminate humans?
p201
aa(lp202
VOne of these class of insecticides,
p203
aVthe neonicontinoids,
p204
aVis making headlines around the world right now.
p205
aVYou've probably heard about it.
p206
aVThis is a new class of insecticides.
p207
aVIt moves through the plant so that a crop pest,
p208
aVa leaf-eating insect,
p209
aVwould take a bite of the plant
p210
aVand get a lethal dose and die.
p211
aVIf one of these neonics, we call them,
p212
aVis applied in a high concentration,
p213
aVsuch as in this ground application,
p214
aVenough of the compound moves through the plant
p215
aVand gets into the pollen and the nectar,
p216
aVwhere a bee can consume, in this case,
p217
aVa high dose of this neurotoxin
p218
aVthat makes the bee twitch and die.
p219
aVIn most agricultural settings, on most of our farms,
p220
aVit's only the seed that's coated with the insecticide,
p221
aVand so a smaller concentration moves through the plant
p222
aVand gets into the pollen and nectar,
p223
aVand if a bee consumes this lower dose,
p224
aVeither nothing happens
p225
aVor the bee becomes intoxicated and disoriented
p226
aVand she may not find her way home.
p227
aVAnd on top of everything else, bees have
p228
aVtheir own set of diseases and parasites.
p229
aVPublic enemy number one for bees is this thing.
p230
aVIt's called varroa destructor.
p231
aVIt's aptly named.
p232
aVIt's this big, blood-sucking parasite
p233
aVthat compromises the bee's immune system
p234
aVand circulates viruses.
p235
aa(lp236
VLet me put this all together for you.
p237
aVI don't know what it feels like to a bee
p238
aVto have a big, bloodsucking parasite running around on it,
p239
aVand I don't know what it feels like to a bee to have a virus,
p240
aVbut I do know what it feels like when I have a virus, the flu,
p241
aVand I know how difficult it is for me to get
p242
aVto the grocery store to get good nutrition.
p243
aVBut what if I lived in a food desert?
p244
aVAnd what if I had to travel a long distance
p245
aVto get to the grocery store,
p246
aVand I finally got my weak body out there
p247
aVand I consumed, in my food,
p248
aVenough of a pesticide, a neurotoxin,
p249
aVthat I couldn't find my way home?
p250
aVAnd this is what we mean by multiple
p251
aVand interacting causes of death.
p252
aa(lp253
VAnd it's not just our honeybees.
p254
aVAll of our beautiful wild species of bees
p255
aVare at risk, including those tomato-pollinating bumblebees.
p256
aVThese bees are providing backup for our honeybees.
p257
aVThey're providing the pollination insurance
p258
aValongside our honeybees.
p259
aVWe need all of our bees.
p260
aa(lp261
VSo what are we going to do?
p262
aVWhat are we going to do about this big bee bummer
p263
aVthat we've created?
p264
aVIt turns out, it's hopeful. It's hopeful.
p265
aVEvery one of you out there can help bees
p266
aVin two very direct and easy ways.
p267
aVPlant bee-friendly flowers,
p268
aVand don't contaminate these flowers,
p269
aVthis bee food, with pesticides.
p270
aVSo go online and search for flowers
p271
aVthat are native to your area and plant them.
p272
aVPlant them in a pot on your doorstep.
p273
aVPlant them in your front yard, in your lawns,
p274
aVin your boulevards.
p275
aVCampaign to have them planted in public gardens,
p276
aVcommunity spaces, meadows.
p277
aVSet aside farmland.
p278
aVWe need a beautiful diversity of flowers
p279
aVthat blooms over the entire growing season,
p280
aVfrom spring to fall.
p281
aVWe need roadsides seeded in flowers for our bees,
p282
aVbut also for migrating butterflies and birds
p283
aVand other wildlife.
p284
aVAnd we need to think carefully about putting back in
p285
aVcover crops to nourish our soil
p286
aVand nourish our bees.
p287
aVAnd we need to diversify our farms.
p288
aVWe need to plant flowering crop borders and hedge rows
p289
aVto disrupt the agricultural food desert
p290
aVand begin to correct the dysfunctional food system
p291
aVthat we've created.
p292
aa(lp293
VSo maybe it seems like a really small countermeasure
p294
aVto a big, huge problem \u2014 just go plant flowers \u2014
p295
aVbut when bees have access to good nutrition,
p296
aVwe have access to good nutrition
p297
aVthrough their pollination services.
p298
aVAnd when bees have access to good nutrition,
p299
aVthey're better able to engage their own natural defenses,
p300
aVtheir healthcare,
p301
aVthat they have relied on for millions of years.
p302
aVSo the beauty of helping bees this way, for me,
p303
aVis that every one of us needs to behave
p304
aVa little bit more like a bee society, an insect society,
p305
aVwhere each of our individual actions
p306
aVcan contribute to a grand solution,
p307
aVan emergent property,
p308
aVthat's much greater than the mere sum
p309
aVof our individual actions.
p310
aVSo let the small act of planting flowers
p311
aVand keeping them free of pesticides
p312
aVbe the driver of large-scale change.
p313
aa(lp314
VOn behalf of the bees, thank you.
p315
aa(lp316
V(Applause)
p317
aa(lp318
VChris Anderson: Thank you. Just a quick question.
p319
aVThe latest numbers on the die-off of bees,
p320
aVis there any sign of things bottoming out?
p321
aVWhat's your hope/depression level on this?
p322
aa(lp323
VMaria Spivak: Yeah.
p324
aVAt least in the United States,
p325
aVan average of 30 percent of all bee hives
p326
aVare lost every winter.
p327
aVAbout 20 years ago,
p328
aVwe were at a 15-percent loss.
p329
aVSo it's getting precarious.
p330
aa(lp331
VCA: That's not 30 percent a year, that's \u2014 MS: Yes, thirty percent a year.
p332
aa(lp333
VCA: Thirty percent a year. MS: But then beekeepers are able to divide their colonies
p334
aVand so they can maintain the same number,
p335
aVthey can recuperate some of their loss.
p336
aa(lp337
VWe're kind of at a tipping point.
p338
aVWe can't really afford to lose that many more.
p339
aVWe need to be really appreciative
p340
aVof all the beekeepers out there. Plant flowers.
p341
aa(lp342
VCA: Thank you.
