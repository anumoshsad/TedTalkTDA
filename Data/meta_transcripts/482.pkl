VI was speaking to a group of about 300 kids,
p4
aVages six to eight, at a children's museum,
p5
aVand I brought with me a bag full of legs,
p6
aVsimilar to the kinds of things you see up here,
p7
aVand had them laid out on a table for the kids.
p8
aVAnd, from my experience, you know, kids are naturally curious
p9
aVabout what they don't know, or don't understand,
p10
aVor is foreign to them.
p11
aVThey only learn to be frightened of those differences
p12
aVwhen an adult influences them to behave that way,
p13
aVand maybe censors that natural curiosity,
p14
aVor you know, reins in the question-asking
p15
aVin the hopes of them being polite little kids.
p16
aVSo I just pictured a first grade teacher out in the lobby
p17
aVwith these unruly kids, saying, "Now, whatever you do,
p18
aVdon't stare at her legs."
p19
aa(lp20
VBut, of course, that's the point.
p21
aVThat's why I was there, I wanted to invite them to look and explore.
p22
aVSo I made a deal with the adults
p23
aVthat the kids could come in without any adults for two minutes
p24
aVon their own.
p25
aVThe doors open, the kids descend on this table of legs,
p26
aVand they are poking and prodding, and they're wiggling toes,
p27
aVand they're trying to put their full weight on the sprinting leg
p28
aVto see what happens with that.
p29
aVAnd I said, "Kids, really quickly \u2014
p30
aVI woke up this morning, I decided I wanted to be able to jump over a house \u2014
p31
aVnothing too big, two or three stories \u2014
p32
aVbut, if you could think of any animal, any superhero, any cartoon character,
p33
aVanything you can dream up right now,
p34
aVwhat kind of legs would you build me?"
p35
aa(lp36
VAnd immediately a voice shouted, "Kangaroo!"
p37
aV"No, no, no! Should be a frog!"
p38
aV"No. It should be Go Go Gadget!"
p39
aV"No, no, no! It should be the Incredibles."
p40
aVAnd other things that I don't \u2014 aren't familiar with.
p41
aVAnd then, one eight-year-old said,
p42
aV"Hey, why wouldn't you want to fly too?"
p43
aVAnd the whole room, including me, was like, "Yeah."
p44
aV(Laughter)
p45
aVAnd just like that, I went from being a woman
p46
aVthat these kids would have been trained to see as "disabled"
p47
aVto somebody that had potential that their bodies didn't have yet.
p48
aVSomebody that might even be super-abled.
p49
aVInteresting.
p50
aa(lp51
VSo some of you actually saw me at TED, 11 years ago.
p52
aVAnd there's been a lot of talk about how life-changing this conference is
p53
aVfor both speakers and attendees, and I am no exception.
p54
aVTED literally was the launch pad to the next decade of my life's exploration.
p55
aVAt the time, the legs I presented were groundbreaking in prosthetics.
p56
aVI had woven carbon fiber sprinting legs
p57
aVmodeled after the hind leg of a cheetah,
p58
aVwhich you may have seen on stage yesterday.
p59
aVAnd also these very life-like, intrinsically painted silicone legs.
p60
aa(lp61
VSo at the time, it was my opportunity to put a call out
p62
aVto innovators outside the traditional medical prosthetic community
p63
aVto come bring their talent to the science and to the art
p64
aVof building legs.
p65
aVSo that we can stop compartmentalizing form, function and aesthetic,
p66
aVand assigning them different values.
p67
aVWell, lucky for me, a lot of people answered that call.
p68
aVAnd the journey started, funny enough, with a TED conference attendee \u2014
p69
aVChee Pearlman, who hopefully is in the audience somewhere today.
p70
aVShe was the editor then of a magazine called ID,
p71
aVand she gave me a cover story.
p72
aa(lp73
VThis started an incredible journey.
p74
aVCurious encounters were happening to me at the time;
p75
aVI'd been accepting numerous invitations to speak
p76
aVon the design of the cheetah legs around the world.
p77
aVAnd people would come up to me after the conference, after my talk,
p78
aVmen and women.
p79
aVAnd the conversation would go something like this,
p80
aV"You know Aimee, you're very attractive.
p81
aVYou don't look disabled."
p82
aV(Laughter)
p83
aVI thought, "Well, that's amazing,
p84
aVbecause I don't feel disabled."
p85
aVAnd it really opened my eyes to this conversation
p86
aVthat could be explored, about beauty.
p87
aVWhat does a beautiful woman have to look like?
p88
aVWhat is a sexy body?
p89
aVAnd interestingly, from an identity standpoint,
p90
aVwhat does it mean to have a disability?
p91
aVI mean, people \u2014 Pamela Anderson has more prosthetic in her body than I do.
p92
aVNobody calls her disabled.
p93
aV(Laughter)
p94
aa(lp95
VSo this magazine, through the hands of graphic designer Peter Saville,
p96
aVwent to fashion designer Alexander McQueen, and photographer Nick Knight,
p97
aVwho were also interested in exploring that conversation.
p98
aVSo, three months after TED I found myself on a plane
p99
aVto London, doing my first fashion shoot,
p100
aVwhich resulted in this cover \u2014
p101
aV"Fashion-able"?
p102
aVThree months after that, I did my first runway show for Alexander McQueen
p103
aVon a pair of hand-carved wooden legs made from solid ash.
p104
aVNobody knew \u2014 everyone thought they were wooden boots.
p105
aVActually, I have them on stage with me:
p106
aVgrapevines, magnolias \u2014 truly stunning.
p107
aVPoetry matters.
p108
aVPoetry is what elevates the banal and neglected object
p109
aVto a realm of art.
p110
aVIt can transform the thing that might have made people fearful
p111
aVinto something that invites them to look,
p112
aVand look a little longer,
p113
aVand maybe even understand.
p114
aa(lp115
VI learned this firsthand with my next adventure.
p116
aVThe artist Matthew Barney, in his film opus called the "The Cremaster Cycle."
p117
aVThis is where it really hit home for me \u2014
p118
aVthat my legs could be wearable sculpture.
p119
aVAnd even at this point, I started to move away from the need to replicate human-ness
p120
aVas the only aesthetic ideal.
p121
aVSo we made what people lovingly referred to as glass legs
p122
aVeven though they're actually optically clear polyurethane,
p123
aVa.k.a. bowling ball material.
p124
aVHeavy!
p125
aVThen we made these legs that are cast in soil
p126
aVwith a potato root system growing in them, and beetroots out the top,
p127
aVand a very lovely brass toe.
p128
aVThat's a good close-up of that one.
p129
aVThen another character was a half-woman, half-cheetah \u2014
p130
aVa little homage to my life as an athlete.
p131
aV14 hours of prosthetic make-up
p132
aVto get into a creature that had articulated paws,
p133
aVclaws and a tail that whipped around,
p134
aVlike a gecko.
p135
aV(Laughter)
p136
aVAnd then another pair of legs we collaborated on were these \u2014
p137
aVlook like jellyfish legs,
p138
aValso polyurethane.
p139
aVAnd the only purpose that these legs can serve,
p140
aVoutside the context of the film,
p141
aVis to provoke the senses and ignite the imagination.
p142
aVSo whimsy matters.
p143
aa(lp144
VToday, I have over a dozen pair of prosthetic legs
p145
aVthat various people have made for me,
p146
aVand with them I have different negotiations of the terrain under my feet,
p147
aVand I can change my height \u2014
p148
aVI have a variable of five different heights.
p149
aV(Laughter)
p150
aVToday, I'm 6'1".
p151
aVAnd I had these legs made a little over a year ago
p152
aVat Dorset Orthopedic in England
p153
aVand when I brought them home to Manhattan,
p154
aVmy first night out on the town, I went to a very fancy party.
p155
aVAnd a girl was there who has known me for years
p156
aVat my normal 5'8".
p157
aVHer mouth dropped open when she saw me,
p158
aVand she went, "But you're so tall!"
p159
aVAnd I said, "I know. Isn't it fun?"
p160
aVI mean, it's a little bit like wearing stilts on stilts,
p161
aVbut I have an entirely new relationship to door jams
p162
aVthat I never expected I would ever have.
p163
aVAnd I was having fun with it.
p164
aVAnd she looked at me,
p165
aVand she said, "But, Aimee, that's not fair."
p166
aV(Laughter)
p167
aV(Applause)
p168
aVAnd the incredible thing was she really meant it.
p169
aVIt's not fair that you can change your height,
p170
aVas you want it.
p171
aa(lp172
VAnd that's when I knew \u2014
p173
aVthat's when I knew that the conversation with society
p174
aVhas changed profoundly
p175
aVin this last decade.
p176
aVIt is no longer a conversation about overcoming deficiency.
p177
aVIt's a conversation about augmentation.
p178
aVIt's a conversation about potential.
p179
aVA prosthetic limb doesn't represent the need to replace loss anymore.
p180
aVIt can stand as a symbol that the wearer
p181
aVhas the power to create whatever it is that they want to create
p182
aVin that space.
p183
aVSo people that society once considered to be disabled
p184
aVcan now become the architects of their own identities
p185
aVand indeed continue to change those identities
p186
aVby designing their bodies
p187
aVfrom a place of empowerment.
p188
aVAnd what is exciting to me so much right now
p189
aVis that by combining cutting-edge technology \u2014
p190
aVrobotics, bionics \u2014
p191
aVwith the age-old poetry,
p192
aVwe are moving closer to understanding our collective humanity.
p193
aVI think that if we want to discover the full potential
p194
aVin our humanity,
p195
aVwe need to celebrate those heartbreaking strengths
p196
aVand those glorious disabilities that we all have.
p197
aVI think of Shakespeare's Shylock:
p198
aV"If you prick us, do we not bleed,
p199
aVand if you tickle us, do we not laugh?"
p200
aVIt is our humanity,
p201
aVand all the potential within it,
p202
aVthat makes us beautiful.
p203
aVThank you.
