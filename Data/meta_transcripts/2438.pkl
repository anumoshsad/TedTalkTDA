VSo a while ago, I tried an experiment.
p4
aVFor one year, I would say yes to all the things that scared me.
p5
aVAnything that made me nervous, took me out of my comfort zone,
p6
aVI forced myself to say yes to.
p7
aVDid I want to speak in public?
p8
aVNo, but yes.
p9
aVDid I want to be on live TV?
p10
aVNo, but yes.
p11
aVDid I want to try acting?
p12
aVNo, no, no, but yes, yes, yes.
p13
aa(lp14
VAnd a crazy thing happened:
p15
aVthe very act of doing the thing that scared me
p16
aVundid the fear,
p17
aVmade it not scary.
p18
aVMy fear of public speaking, my social anxiety, poof, gone.
p19
aVIt's amazing, the power of one word.
p20
aV"Yes" changed my life.
p21
aV"Yes" changed me.
p22
aVBut there was one particular yes
p23
aVthat affected my life in the most profound way,
p24
aVin a way I never imagined,
p25
aVand it started with a question from my toddler.
p26
aa(lp27
VI have these three amazing daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson,
p28
aVand Emerson is a toddler who inexplicably refers to everyone as "honey."
p29
aVas though she's a Southern waitress.
p30
aa(lp31
V(Laughter)
p32
aa(lp33
V"Honey, I'm gonna need some milk for my sippy cup."
p34
aa(lp35
V(Laughter)
p36
aa(lp37
VThe Southern waitress asked me to play with her one evening
p38
aVwhen I was on my way somewhere, and I said, "Yes."
p39
aVAnd that yes was the beginning of a new way of life for my family.
p40
aVI made a vow that from now on,
p41
aVevery time one of my children asks me to play,
p42
aVno matter what I'm doing or where I'm going,
p43
aVI say yes, every single time.
p44
aVAlmost. I'm not perfect at it, but I try hard to practice it.
p45
aVAnd it's had a magical effect on me,
p46
aVon my children, on our family.
p47
aVBut it's also had a stunning side effect,
p48
aVand it wasn't until recently that I fully understood it,
p49
aVthat I understood that saying yes to playing with my children
p50
aVlikely saved my career.
p51
aa(lp52
VSee, I have what most people would call a dream job.
p53
aVI'm a writer. I imagine. I make stuff up for a living.
p54
aVDream job.
p55
aVNo.
p56
aVI'm a titan.
p57
aVDream job.
p58
aVI create television. I executive produce television.
p59
aVI make television, a great deal of television.
p60
aVIn one way or another, this TV season,
p61
aVI'm responsible for bringing about 70 hours of programming to the world.
p62
aVFour television programs, 70 hours of TV \u2014
p63
aa(lp64
V(Applause)
p65
aa(lp66
VThree shows in production at a time, sometimes four.
p67
aVEach show creates hundreds of jobs that didn't exist before.
p68
aVThe budget for one episode of network television
p69
aVcan be anywhere from three to six million dollars.
p70
aVLet's just say five.
p71
aVA new episode made every nine days times four shows,
p72
aVso every nine days that's 20 million dollars worth of television,
p73
aVfour television programs, 70 hours of TV,
p74
aVthree shows in production at a time, sometimes four,
p75
aV16 episodes going on at all times:
p76
aV24 episodes of "Grey's," 21 episodes of "Scandal,"
p77
aV15 episodes of "How To Get Away With Murder,"
p78
aV10 episodes of "The Catch," that's 70 hours of TV,
p79
aVthat's 350 million dollars for a season.
p80
aVIn America, my television shows
p81
aVare back to back to back on Thursday night.
p82
aVAround the world, my shows air in 256 territories in 67 languages
p83
aVfor an audience of 30 million people.
p84
aVMy brain is global,
p85
aVand 45 hours of that 70 hours of TV are shows I personally created
p86
aVand not just produced, so on top of everything else,
p87
aVI need to find time, real quiet, creative time,
p88
aVto gather my fans around the campfire
p89
aVand tell my stories.
p90
aVFour television programs, 70 hours of TV,
p91
aVthree shows in production at a time,
p92
aVsometimes four, 350 million dollars, campfires burning all over the world.
p93
aVYou know who else is doing that?
p94
aVNobody, so like I said, I'm a titan.
p95
aVDream job.
p96
aa(lp97
V(Applause)
p98
aa(lp99
VNow, I don't tell you this to impress you.
p100
aVI tell you this because I know what you think of when you hear the word "writer."
p101
aVI tell you this so that all of you out there who work so hard,
p102
aVwhether you run a company or a country or a classroom
p103
aVor a store or a home,
p104
aVtake me seriously when I talk about working,
p105
aVso you'll get that I don't peck at a computer and imagine all day,
p106
aVso you'll hear me when I say
p107
aVthat I understand that a dream job is not about dreaming.
p108
aVIt's all job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat, no tears.
p109
aVI work a lot, very hard, and I love it.
p110
aa(lp111
VWhen I'm hard at work, when I'm deep in it,
p112
aVthere is no other feeling.
p113
aVFor me, my work is at all times building a nation out of thin air.
p114
aVIt is manning the troops. It is painting a canvas.
p115
aVIt is hitting every high note. It is running a marathon.
p116
aVIt is being Beyoncé.
p117
aVAnd it is all of those things at the same time.
p118
aVI love working.
p119
aVIt is creative and mechanical and exhausting and exhilarating
p120
aVand hilarious and disturbing and clinical and maternal
p121
aVand cruel and judicious,
p122
aVand what makes it all so good is the hum.
p123
aVThere is some kind of shift inside me when the work gets good.
p124
aVA hum begins in my brain,
p125
aVand it grows and it grows and that hum sounds like the open road,
p126
aVand I could drive it forever.
p127
aVAnd a lot of people, when I try to explain the hum,
p128
aVthey assume that I'm talking about the writing,
p129
aVthat my writing brings me joy.
p130
aVAnd don't get me wrong, it does.
p131
aVBut the hum \u2014
p132
aVit wasn't until I started making television
p133
aVthat I started working, working and making
p134
aVand building and creating and collaborating,
p135
aVthat I discovered this thing, this buzz, this rush, this hum.
p136
aVThe hum is more than writing.
p137
aVThe hum is action and activity. The hum is a drug.
p138
aVThe hum is music. The hum is light and air.
p139
aVThe hum is God's whisper right in my ear.
p140
aVAnd when you have a hum like that,
p141
aVyou can't help but strive for greatness.
p142
aVThat feeling, you can't help but strive for greatness at any cost.
p143
aVThat's called the hum.
p144
aVOr, maybe it's called being a workaholic.
p145
aa(lp146
V(Laughter)
p147
aa(lp148
VMaybe it's called genius.
p149
aVMaybe it's called ego.
p150
aVMaybe it's just fear of failure.
p151
aVI don't know.
p152
aVI just know that I'm not built for failure,
p153
aVand I just know that I love the hum.
p154
aVI just know that I want to tell you I'm a titan,
p155
aVand I know that I don't want to question it.
p156
aa(lp157
VBut here's the thing:
p158
aVthe more successful I become,
p159
aVthe more shows, the more episodes, the more barriers broken,
p160
aVthe more work there is to do,
p161
aVthe more balls in the air,
p162
aVthe more eyes on me, the more history stares,
p163
aVthe more expectations there are.
p164
aVThe more I work to be successful,
p165
aVthe more I need to work.
p166
aVAnd what did I say about work?
p167
aVI love working, right?
p168
aVThe nation I'm building, the marathon I'm running,
p169
aVthe troops, the canvas, the high note, the hum,
p170
aVthe hum, the hum.
p171
aVI like that hum. I love that hum.
p172
aVI need that hum. I am that hum.
p173
aVAm I nothing but that hum?
p174
aa(lp175
VAnd then the hum stopped.
p176
aVOverworked, overused,
p177
aVoverdone, burned out.
p178
aVThe hum stopped.
p179
aa(lp180
VNow, my three daughters are used to the truth
p181
aVthat their mother is a single working titan.
p182
aVHarper tells people,
p183
aV"My mom won't be there, but you can text my nanny."
p184
aVAnd Emerson says, "Honey, I'm wanting to go to ShondaLand."
p185
aVThey're children of a titan.
p186
aVThey're baby titans.
p187
aVThey were 12, 3, and 1 when the hum stopped.
p188
aVThe hum of the engine died.
p189
aVI stopped loving work. I couldn't restart the engine.
p190
aVThe hum would not come back.
p191
aVMy hum was broken.
p192
aVI was doing the same things I always did, all the same titan work,
p193
aV15-hour days, working straight through the weekends,
p194
aVno regrets, never surrender, a titan never sleeps, a titan never quits,
p195
aVfull hearts, clear eyes, yada, whatever.
p196
aVBut there was no hum.
p197
aVInside me was silence.
p198
aVFour television programs, 70 hours of TV, three shows in production at a time,
p199
aVsometimes four.
p200
aVFour television programs, 70 hours of TV, three shows in production at a time ...
p201
aVI was the perfect titan.
p202
aVI was a titan you could take home to your mother.
p203
aVAll the colors were the same, and I was no longer having any fun.
p204
aVAnd it was my life.
p205
aVIt was all I did.
p206
aVI was the hum, and the hum was me.
p207
aVSo what do you do when the thing you do,
p208
aVthe work you love, starts to taste like dust?
p209
aa(lp210
VNow, I know somebody's out there thinking,
p211
aV"Cry me a river, stupid writer titan lady."
p212
aa(lp213
V(Laughter)
p214
aa(lp215
VBut you know, you do,
p216
aVif you make, if you work, if you love what you do,
p217
aVbeing a teacher, being a banker, being a mother, being a painter,
p218
aVbeing Bill Gates,
p219
aVif you simply love another person and that gives you the hum,
p220
aVif you know the hum,
p221
aVif you know what the hum feels like, if you have been to the hum,
p222
aVwhen the hum stops, who are you?
p223
aVWhat are you?
p224
aVWhat am I?
p225
aVAm I still a titan?
p226
aVIf the song of my heart ceases to play, can I survive in the silence?
p227
aa(lp228
VAnd then my Southern waitress toddler asks me a question.
p229
aVI'm on my way out the door, I'm late, and she says,
p230
aV"Momma, wanna play?"
p231
aa(lp232
VAnd I'm just about to say no, when I realize two things.
p233
aVOne, I'm supposed to say yes to everything,
p234
aVand two, my Southern waitress didn't call me "honey."
p235
aVShe's not calling everyone "honey" anymore.
p236
aVWhen did that happen?
p237
aVI'm missing it, being a titan and mourning my hum,
p238
aVand here she is changing right before my eyes.
p239
aVAnd so she says, "Momma, wanna play?"
p240
aVAnd I say, "Yes."
p241
aVThere's nothing special about it.
p242
aVWe play, and we're joined by her sisters,
p243
aVand there's a lot of laughing,
p244
aVand I give a dramatic reading from the book Everybody Poops.
p245
aVNothing out of the ordinary.
p246
aa(lp247
V(Laughter)
p248
aa(lp249
VAnd yet, it is extraordinary,
p250
aVbecause in my pain and my panic,
p251
aVin the homelessness of my humlessness,
p252
aVI have nothing to do but pay attention.
p253
aVI focus.
p254
aVI am still.
p255
aVThe nation I'm building, the marathon I'm running,
p256
aVthe troops, the canvas, the high note does not exist.
p257
aVAll that exists are sticky fingers
p258
aVand gooey kisses and tiny voices and crayons
p259
aVand that song about letting go
p260
aVof whatever it is that Frozen girl needs to let go of.
p261
aa(lp262
V(Laughter)
p263
aa(lp264
VIt's all peace and simplicity.
p265
aVThe air is so rare in this place for me that I can barely breathe.
p266
aVI can barely believe I'm breathing.
p267
aVPlay is the opposite of work.
p268
aVAnd I am happy.
p269
aVSomething in me loosens.
p270
aVA door in my brain swings open,
p271
aVand a rush of energy comes.
p272
aVAnd it's not instantaneous, but it happens, it does happen.
p273
aVI feel it.
p274
aVA hum creeps back.
p275
aVNot at full volume, barely there,
p276
aVit's quiet, and I have to stay very still to hear it, but it is there.
p277
aVNot the hum, but a hum.
p278
aa(lp279
VAnd now I feel like I know a very magical secret.
p280
aVWell, let's not get carried away.
p281
aVIt's just love. That's all it is.
p282
aVNo magic. No secret. It's just love.
p283
aVIt's just something we forgot.
p284
aVThe hum, the work hum, the hum of the titan,
p285
aVthat's just a replacement.
p286
aVIf I have to ask you who I am,
p287
aVif I have to tell you who I am,
p288
aVif I describe myself in terms of shows
p289
aVand hours of television and how globally badass my brain is,
p290
aVI have forgotten what the real hum is.
p291
aVThe hum is not power and the hum is not work-specific.
p292
aVThe hum is joy-specific.
p293
aVThe real hum is love-specific.
p294
aVThe hum is the electricity that comes from being excited by life.
p295
aVThe real hum is confidence and peace.
p296
aVThe real hum ignores the stare of history,
p297
aVand the balls in the air, and the expectation, and the pressure.
p298
aVThe real hum is singular and original.
p299
aVThe real hum is God's whisper in my ear,
p300
aVbut maybe God was whispering the wrong words,
p301
aVbecause which one of the gods was telling me I was the titan?
p302
aa(lp303
VIt's just love.
p304
aVWe could all use a little more love,
p305
aVa lot more love.
p306
aVAny time my child asks me to play,
p307
aVI will say yes.
p308
aVI make it a firm rule for one reason,
p309
aVto give myself permission,
p310
aVto free me from all of my workaholic guilt.
p311
aVIt's a law, so I don't have a choice,
p312
aVand I don't have a choice,
p313
aVnot if I want to feel the hum.
p314
aa(lp315
VI wish it were that easy,
p316
aVbut I'm not good at playing.
p317
aVI don't like it.
p318
aVI'm not interested in doing it the way I'm interested in doing work.
p319
aVThe truth is incredibly humbling and humiliating to face.
p320
aVI don't like playing.
p321
aVI work all the time because I like working.
p322
aVI like working more than I like being at home.
p323
aVFacing that fact is incredibly difficult to handle,
p324
aVbecause what kind of person likes working more than being at home?
p325
aa(lp326
VWell, me.
p327
aVI mean, let's be honest, I call myself a titan.
p328
aVI've got issues.
p329
aa(lp330
V(Laughter)
p331
aa(lp332
VAnd one of those issues isn't that I am too relaxed.
p333
aa(lp334
V(Laughter)
p335
aa(lp336
VWe run around the yard, up and back and up and back.
p337
aVWe have 30-second dance parties.
p338
aVWe sing show tunes. We play with balls.
p339
aVI blow bubbles and they pop them.
p340
aVAnd I feel stiff and delirious and confused most of the time.
p341
aVI itch for my cell phone always.
p342
aVBut it is OK.
p343
aVMy tiny humans show me how to live and the hum of the universe fills me up.
p344
aVI play and I play until I begin to wonder
p345
aVwhy we ever stop playing in the first place.
p346
aa(lp347
VYou can do it too,
p348
aVsay yes every time your child asks you to play.
p349
aVAre you thinking that maybe I'm an idiot in diamond shoes?
p350
aVYou're right, but you can still do this.
p351
aVYou have time.
p352
aVYou know why? Because you're not Rihanna and you're not a Muppet.
p353
aVYour child does not think you're that interesting.
p354
aa(lp355
V(Laughter)
p356
aa(lp357
VYou only need 15 minutes.
p358
aVMy two- and four-year-old only ever want to play with me
p359
aVfor about 15 minutes or so
p360
aVbefore they think to themselves they want to do something else.
p361
aVIt's an amazing 15 minutes, but it's 15 minutes.
p362
aVIf I'm not a ladybug or a piece of candy, I'm invisible after 15 minutes.
p363
aa(lp364
V(Laughter)
p365
aa(lp366
VAnd my 13-year-old, if I can get a 13-year-old to talk to me for 15 minutes
p367
aVI'm Parent of the Year.
p368
aa(lp369
V(Laughter)
p370
aa(lp371
V15 minutes is all you need.
p372
aVI can totally pull off 15 minutes of uninterrupted time on my worst day.
p373
aVUninterrupted is the key.
p374
aVNo cell phone, no laundry, no anything.
p375
aVYou have a busy life. You have to get dinner on the table.
p376
aVYou have to force them to bathe. But you can do 15 minutes.
p377
aVMy kids are my happy place, they're my world,
p378
aVbut it doesn't have to be your kids,
p379
aVthe fuel that feeds your hum,
p380
aVthe place where life feels more good than not good.
p381
aVIt's not about playing with your kids,
p382
aVit's about joy.
p383
aVIt's about playing in general.
p384
aVGive yourself the 15 minutes.
p385
aVFind what makes you feel good.
p386
aVJust figure it out and play in that arena.
p387
aa(lp388
VI'm not perfect at it. In fact, I fail as often as I succeed,
p389
aVseeing friends, reading books, staring into space.
p390
aV"Wanna play?" starts to become shorthand for indulging myself
p391
aVin ways I'd given up on right around the time I got my first TV show,
p392
aVright around the time I became a titan-in-training,
p393
aVright around the time I started competing with myself for ways unknown.
p394
aV15 minutes? What could be wrong with giving myself my full attention
p395
aVfor 15 minutes?
p396
aVTurns out, nothing.
p397
aVThe very act of not working has made it possible for the hum to return,
p398
aVas if the hum's engine could only refuel while I was away.
p399
aVWork doesn't work without play.
p400
aa(lp401
VIt takes a little time, but after a few months,
p402
aVone day the floodgates open
p403
aVand there's a rush, and I find myself standing in my office
p404
aVfilled with an unfamiliar melody, full on groove inside me,
p405
aVand around me, and it sends me spinning with ideas,
p406
aVand the humming road is open, and I can drive it and drive it,
p407
aVand I love working again.
p408
aVBut now, I like that hum, but I don't love that hum.
p409
aVI don't need that hum.
p410
aVI am not that hum. That hum is not me,
p411
aVnot anymore.
p412
aVI am bubbles and sticky fingers and dinners with friends.
p413
aVI am that hum.
p414
aVLife's hum.
p415
aVLove's hum.
p416
aVWork's hum is still a piece of me, it is just no longer all of me,
p417
aVand I am so grateful.
p418
aVAnd I don't give a crap about being a titan,
p419
aVbecause I have never once seen a titan play Red Rover, Red Rover.
p420
aa(lp421
VI said yes to less work and more play, and somehow I still run my world.
p422
aVMy brain is still global. My campfires still burn.
p423
aVThe more I play, the happier I am, and the happier my kids are.
p424
aVThe more I play, the more I feel like a good mother.
p425
aVThe more I play, the freer my mind becomes.
p426
aVThe more I play, the better I work.
p427
aVThe more I play, the more I feel the hum,
p428
aVthe nation I'm building, the marathon I'm running,
p429
aVthe troops, the canvas, the high note, the hum, the hum,
p430
aVthe other hum, the real hum,
p431
aVlife's hum.
p432
aVThe more I feel that hum,
p433
aVthe more this strange, quivering, uncocooned,
p434
aVawkward, brand new,
p435
aValive non-titan feels like me.
p436
aVThe more I feel that hum, the more I know who I am.
p437
aVI'm a writer, I make stuff up, I imagine.
p438
aVThat part of the job, that's living the dream.
p439
aVThat's the dream of the job.
p440
aVBecause a dream job should be a little bit dreamy.
p441
aa(lp442
VI said yes to less work and more play.
p443
aVTitans need not apply.
p444
aa(lp445
VWanna play?
p446
aa(lp447
VThank you.
p448
