VI'm the weekly tech critic for the New York Times.
p4
aVI review gadgets and stuff.
p5
aVAnd mostly what good dads should be doing this time of year
p6
aVis nestling with their kids and decorating the Christmas tree.
p7
aVWhat I'm mostly doing this year
p8
aVis going on cable TV and answering the same question:
p9
aV"What are the tech trends for next year?"
p10
aVAnd I'm like, "Didn't we just go through this last year?"
p11
aa(lp12
VBut I'm going to pick the one that interests me most, and that is the
p13
aVcompleted marriage of the cell phone and the Internet.
p14
aVYou know, I found that volcano on Google Images,
p15
aVnot realizing how much it makes me look like the cover of Dianetics.
p16
aa(lp17
V(Laughter)
p18
aa(lp19
VAnyway, this all started a few years ago,
p20
aVwhen they started carrying your voice over the Internet rather than over a phone line,
p21
aVand we've come a long way since that.
p22
aVBut that was interesting in itself. This is companies like Vonage.
p23
aVBasically you take an ordinary telephone, you plug it into this little box
p24
aVthat they give you and the box plugs into your cable modem.
p25
aVNow, it works just like a regular phone.
p26
aVSo you can pick up the phone, you hear a dial tone,
p27
aVbut its just a fake-out. It's a WAV file of a dial tone,
p28
aVjust to reassure you that the world hasn't ended.
p29
aVIt could be anything. It could be salsa music
p30
aVor a comedy routine \u2014 it doesn't matter.
p31
aVThe little box has your phone number.
p32
aVSo that's really cool \u2014 you can take it to London or Siberia,
p33
aVand your next door neighbor can dial your home number and your phone will ring,
p34
aVbecause it's got everything in the box.
p35
aVThey've got every feature known to man in there,
p36
aVbecause adding a new feature is just software.
p37
aa(lp38
VAnd as a result of Voice Over IP \u2014
p39
aVI hate that term \u2014 Voice Over Internet \u2014
p40
aVland-line home-phone service has gone down 30 percent in the last three years.
p41
aVI mean, no self-respecting college kid has home phone service anymore.
p42
aVThis is what college kids are more likely to have. It's the most popular
p43
aVVOIP service in the world: It's Skype.
p44
aVIt's a free program you download for your Mac or PC,
p45
aVand you make free phone calls anywhere in the world
p46
aVThe downside is that you have to wear a headset like a nerd.
p47
aVIt's not your phone \u2014 it's your computer.
p48
aVBut nonetheless, if you're a college kid and you have no money,
p49
aVbelieve me, this is better than trying to use your cell phone.
p50
aa(lp51
VIt's really cute seeing middle-aged people
p52
aVlike me, try out Skype for the first time,
p53
aVwhich is usually when their kid goes away for a semester abroad.
p54
aVThey don't want to pay the international fees,
p55
aVso they're like, "Timmy! Is that you?"
p56
aa(lp57
V(Laughter)
p58
aa(lp59
VIt's really cute.
p60
aVBut I \u2014 at least it was when I did it \u2014
p61
aa(lp62
V(Laughter)
p63
aa(lp64
VI think where VOIP is really going to get interesting
p65
aVis when they start putting it on cell phones.
p66
aVImagine if you had an ordinary cell phone,
p67
aVand any time you were in a wireless hotspot \u2014
p68
aVfree calls anywhere in the world,
p69
aVnever pay the cellular company a nickel.
p70
aVIt'd be really, really cool \u2014 and yet,
p71
aVeven though the technology for this has been available
p72
aVfor five years, incredibly,
p73
aVthe number of standard cell phones
p74
aVoffered by US carriers with free VOIP
p75
aVis zero!
p76
aVI can't figure out why!
p77
aa(lp78
V(Laughter)
p79
aa(lp80
VActually, I need to update that. There's one now.
p81
aVAnd it's so interesting that I thought I would tell you about it.
p82
aVIt comes from T-Mobile.
p83
aVAnd I am not paid by T-Mobile.
p84
aVI'm not plugging T-Mobile.
p85
aVThe New York Times has very rigid policies about that.
p86
aVEver since that Jayson Blair jerk ruined it for all of us.
p87
aa(lp88
V(Laughter)
p89
aa(lp90
VBasically, the reason you haven't heard about this program
p91
aVis because it was introduced last year
p92
aVon June 29.
p93
aVDoes anyone remember what else happened on June 29 last year?
p94
aVIt was the iPhone. The iPhone came out that day.
p95
aVI'm like, can you imagine being the
p96
aVT-Mobile PR lady? You know?
p97
aa(lp98
V"Hi, we have an announcement to \u2014 WAH!!!"
p99
aa(lp100
V(Laughter)
p101
aa(lp102
VBut it's actually really, really cool. You have a choice of phones,
p103
aVand we're not talking smartphones \u2014
p104
aVordinary phones, including a Blackberry, that have Wi-Fi.
p105
aVThe deal is, any time you're in a Wi-Fi hotspot,
p106
aVall your calls are free.
p107
aVAnd when you're out of the hotspot, you're on the regular cellular network.
p108
aVYou're thinking, "Well, how often am I in a hotspot?"
p109
aVThe answer is, "All the time!"
p110
aVBecause they give you
p111
aVa regular wireless router that works with the phone,
p112
aVfor your house.
p113
aVWhich is really ingenious, because we all know that
p114
aVT-Mobile is the most pathetic carrier.
p115
aVThey have coverage like the size of my thumbnail.
p116
aV(Laughter)
p117
aVBut it's a hundred million dollars to put up one of those towers. Right?
p118
aVThey don't have that kind of money. Instead they give each of us
p119
aVa seven-dollar-and-95-cent box. They're like a stealth tower installation program.
p120
aVWe're putting it in our homes for them!
p121
aa(lp122
VAnyway, they have Wi-Fi phones in Europe.
p123
aVBut the thing that T-Mobile did that nobody's done before
p124
aVis, when you're on a call an you move from Wi-Fi into cellular range,
p125
aVthe call is handed off in mid-syllable,
p126
aVseamlessly. I'll show you the advanced technologies
p127
aVwe use at the New York Times to test this gear.
p128
aVThis is me with a camcorder on a phone
p129
aVgoing like this.
p130
aa(lp131
V(Laughter)
p132
aa(lp133
VAs I walk out of the house from my Wi-Fi hotspot
p134
aVinto the cellular network on a call with my wife \u2014
p135
aVlook at the upper left. That's the Wi-Fi signal.
p136
aa(lp137
V(Video): Jennifer Pogue: Hello?
p138
aa(lp139
VDavid Pogue: Hi babes, it's me.
p140
aa(lp141
VJP: Oh, hi darling, how are you?
p142
aa(lp143
VDP: You're on Wi-Fi. How does it sound?
p144
aa(lp145
VJP: Oh, it sounds pretty good.
p146
aa(lp147
VNow, I'm leaving the house. DP: I'm going for a walk \u2014 do you mind?
p148
aa(lp149
VJP: No not at all. I'm having a great day with the kids.
p150
aa(lp151
VDP: What are you guys doing?
p152
aa(lp153
VRight there!
p154
aVIt just changed to the cellular tower in mid-call.
p155
aVI don't know why my wife says I never listen to her. I don't get that.
p156
aa(lp157
V(Laughter)
p158
aa(lp159
VThe bottom line is that the boundaries,
p160
aVbecause of the Internet plus cell phone, are melting.
p161
aVThe cool thing about the T-Mobile phones
p162
aVis that although switching technologies is very advanced,
p163
aVthe billing technology has not caught up.
p164
aVSo what I mean is that you can start a call
p165
aVin your house in the Wi-Fi hotspot,
p166
aVyou can get in your car and talk until the battery's dead \u2014
p167
aVwhich would be like 10 minutes \u2014
p168
aa(lp169
V(Laughter)
p170
aa(lp171
VAnd the call will continue to be free.
p172
aVBecause they don't, they haven't \u2014
p173
aVwell, no, wait! Not so fast.
p174
aVIt also works the other way.
p175
aVSo if you start a call on your cellular network
p176
aVand you come home, you keep being billed.
p177
aVWhich is why most people with this service
p178
aVget into the habit of saying,
p179
aV"Hey, I just got home. Can I call you right back?"
p180
aVNow you get it.
p181
aVIt's also true that if you use one of these phones overseas,
p182
aVit doesn't know what Internet hotspot you're in.
p183
aVOn the Internet nobody knows you're a dog,
p184
aVright? Nobody knows you're in Pakistan.
p185
aVYou can make free unlimited calls
p186
aVhome to the US with these phones. So, very, very interesting.
p187
aa(lp188
VThis is another favorite of mine.
p189
aVDoes anyone here have a working cell phone
p190
aVthat's on, with coverage, who can make a call right now without a lot of fussing?
p191
aVOK. Would you call me please right now? [Phone number given.]
p192
aVAnd don't you all call me at three a.m. asking me to fix your printer.
p193
aa(lp194
V(Laughter)
p195
aa(lp196
VI have two cell phones, so this going to be very odd, if it works.
p197
aVI should know not to do technology demos
p198
aVin front of an audience. It's just, like, absurd.
p199
aVThis one is going off. And \u2014 oh, I have the ringer off. Tsh! Great.
p200
aVAnyway, this one is also going off. So they're both ringing at the same time.
p201
aVExcuse me one second.
p202
aVHello?
p203
aVOh. Where are you calling from?
p204
aVNo, no just kidding. There he is. Thank you very much for doing that.
p205
aVI didn't even know it was you \u2014 I was looking at this guy.
p206
aVOh great! Yeah. Yeah you can all stop calling now!
p207
aa(lp208
V(Laughter)
p209
aa(lp210
VAll right! We've made the point.
p211
aVAll right. Ringer off. Everyone wants in on the action.
p212
aa(lp213
V(Laughter)
p214
aa(lp215
VSo this is Grand Central at work \u2014 it's a \u2014
p216
aVoh, for gods sake!
p217
aa(lp218
V(Laughter)
p219
aa(lp220
VI have your numbers now!
p221
aa(lp222
V(Laughter)
p223
aa(lp224
VYou will pay.
p225
aa(lp226
VGrand Central is this really brilliant idea
p227
aVwhere they give you a new phone number,
p228
aVand then at that point one phone number rings all your phones at once.
p229
aVYour home phone, your work phone, your cell phone, your yacht phone
p230
aV(this is the EG crowd).
p231
aa(lp232
V(Laughter)
p233
aa(lp234
VThe beauty of that is you never miss a call.
p235
aVI know a lot of you are like,
p236
aV"Ooh, I don't want to be reached at any hour."
p237
aVBut the beauty is it's all going through the internet,
p238
aVso you get all of these really cool features \u2014
p239
aVlike you can say, I want these people to be able to call me only during these hours.
p240
aVAnd I want these people to hear this greeting,
p241
aV"Hi boss, I'm out making us both some money. Leave a message."
p242
aVAnd then your wife calls, and, "Hi honey, leave me a message."
p243
aVVery, very customizable.
p244
aVGoogle bought it, and they've been working on it for a year.
p245
aVThey're supposed to come out with it very shortly in a public method.
p246
aa(lp247
VBy the way, this is something that really bothers me.
p248
aVI don't know if you realize this. When you call 411 on your cell phone,
p249
aVthey charge you two bucks.
p250
aVDid you know that? It's an outrage.
p251
aVI actually got a photograph of the Verizon employee right there.
p252
aVI'm going to tell you how to avoid that now.
p253
aVWhat you're going to use is Google Cellular.
p254
aVIt's totally free \u2014 there's not even ads.
p255
aVIf you know how to send a text message, you can get the same information for free.
p256
aVI'm about to change your life. So here's me doing it.
p257
aVYou send a text message to the word "Google,"
p258
aVwhich turns out to be 46645.
p259
aVLeave off the last "e" for savings.
p260
aa(lp261
VAnyway, so lets say you need a drugstore near Chicago.
p262
aVYou type "pharmacy Chicago," or the zip code.
p263
aVYou hit send, and in five seconds,
p264
aVthey will send you back the two closest drugstores,
p265
aVcomplete with name address and phone number.
p266
aVHere it comes.
p267
aVAnd it's already written down \u2014 so, like, if you're driving,
p268
aVyou don't have to do one of these things, "Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh."
p269
aa(lp270
VIt works with weather, too.
p271
aVYou can say "Weather," and the name of the city you're going to travel to.
p272
aVAnd then in five seconds, they send you back
p273
aVthe complete weather forecast for that town.
p274
aVShortly I'll tell you why I was in Milan.
p275
aVHere we go. And those are just the beginning.
p276
aVThese are all the different things that you can text to Google and they will \u2014
p277
aVyeah! You're all trying to write this down.
p278
aVThat's cute. I do have an email address. You can just ask me.
p279
aVIt's absolutely phenomenal. The only downside
p280
aVis that it requires you to know how to text \u2014
p281
aVsend a text message. Nobody over 40 knows how to do that.
p282
aa(lp283
VSo I'm going to teach you something even better.
p284
aVThis is called Google Info.
p285
aVThey've just launched this voice-activated version of the same thing.
p286
aVIt's speech recognition like you've never heard before.
p287
aVSo lets say I'm in Monterey,
p288
aVand I want what?
p289
aVI want to find what? Bagels. OK.
p290
aa(lp291
VGoogle: Say the business and the city and state.
p292
aa(lp293
VDP: Bagels, Monterey, California.
p294
aVI got the Chinese line.
p295
aa(lp296
V(Laughter)
p297
aa(lp298
VGoogle: Bagels, Monterey, California.
p299
aVTop eight results: Number one,
p300
aVBagel Bakery on El Dorado Street.
p301
aVTo select number one, you can press one or say "number one."
p302
aVNumber two: Bagel Bakery, commissary department.
p303
aa(lp304
VNumber Two. Number Two. Two.
p305
aa(lp306
V(Laughter)
p307
aa(lp308
VWhy do I listen to people in the audience?
p309
aVWell anyway \u2014 oh! Here we go!
p310
aa(lp311
VGoogle: ... commissary department on McClellan Avenue, Monterey.
p312
aVI'll connect you, or say "details," or "go back."
p313
aa(lp314
VDP: He's connecting me! He doesn't even tell me the phone number.
p315
aVHe's just connecting me directly. It's like having a personal valet.
p316
aa(lp317
VGoogle: Hold on.
p318
aa(lp319
V(Laughter)
p320
aa(lp321
VDP: Hi, could I have 400 with a schmear?
p322
aVNo, no, no \u2014 just kidding, no no.
p323
aVSo anyway, you never even find out the number.
p324
aVIt's just so amazing.
p325
aVAnd it has incredible, incredible accuracy.
p326
aVThis is even more amazing. Put this in your speed dial.
p327
aVThis you can ask by voice any question.
p328
aVWho won the 1958 World Series?
p329
aVWhat's the recipe for a certain cocktail?
p330
aVIt's absolutely amazing \u2014 and they text you back the answer.
p331
aVI tried this this morning just to make sure it's still alive.
p332
aV"Which actors have played James Bond?"
p333
aVThey text me back this: "Sean Connery,
p334
aVGeorge Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan, Daniel Craig."
p335
aVRight! And then I was trying to pretend I was like a Valley girl.
p336
aVI'm like, "What's the word that means you know, like,
p337
aVwhen the sun, the moon and the earth are, like, all in a line?"
p338
aVJust to see how the recognition was.
p339
aVThey texted me back, "It's called a syzygy."
p340
aVWhich I knew, because it's the word that won me the Ohio spelling bee in 1976.
p341
aa(lp342
VYou know, there's a lot of people wondering, "How on earth are they going to
p343
aVmake money doing this?" And the answer is: look at the last line.
p344
aVThey put this teeny-weeny little ad, about 10 characters long.
p345
aVAnd a lot of people also want to know, "How does it work?
p346
aVHow can it be so good? It's as though there is a human being
p347
aVon the other end of the line."
p348
aVBecause there is one!
p349
aVThey have 10,000 people
p350
aVwho are being paid 20 cents per answer.
p351
aVAs you can imagine, it's college kids and old people.
p352
aVThat's who can afford to do that.
p353
aVBut it's a human being on the line. And it's gotten me out of so many
p354
aVtough positions like, "When's the last flight out of Chicago?"
p355
aVYou know. It's just absolutely amazing.
p356
aa(lp357
VAnother thing that really bothers me about cell phones today \u2014
p358
aVthis is probably my biggest pet peeve in all of technology.
p359
aVWhen I call to leave you a message,
p360
aVI get 15 seconds of instructions
p361
aVfrom a third-grade teacher on Ambien!
p362
aa(lp363
V(Laughter)
p364
aa(lp365
V"To page this person ... "
p366
aVPage? What is this, 1975?
p367
aVNobody has pagers anymore.
p368
aV"You may begin speaking at the tone.
p369
aVWhen you have finished recording,
p370
aVyou may hang up." No!
p371
aa(lp372
V(Laughter)
p373
aa(lp374
VAnd then it gets worse:
p375
aVwhen I call to retrieve my messages,
p376
aVfirst of all: "You have 87 messages.
p377
aVTo listen to your messages ... "
p378
aVWhy else am I calling?
p379
aa(lp380
V(Laughter)
p381
aa(lp382
VOf course I want to listen to the messages!
p383
aa(lp384
V(Laughter)
p385
aa(lp386
VOh! You all have cell phones too.
p387
aVSo last year I went to Milan, Italy,
p388
aVand I got to speak to an audience
p389
aVof cellular executives from 200 countries around the world.
p390
aVAnd I said as a joke \u2014 as a joke, I said,
p391
aV"I did the math. Verizon has 70 million customers.
p392
aVIf you check your voicemail twice a day,
p393
aVthat's 100 million dollars a year.
p394
aVI bet you guys are doing this just to run up our airtime, aren't you?"
p395
aVNo chuckle. They're like this \u2014
p396
aa(lp397
V(Laughter)
p398
aa(lp399
VWhere is the outrage, people? Rise up!
p400
aa(lp401
V(Laughter)
p402
aa(lp403
VSorry. I'm not bitter.
p404
aa(lp405
V(Laughter)
p406
aa(lp407
VSo now I'm going to tell you how to get out of that.
p408
aVThere are these services that transcribe
p409
aVyour voicemail into text.
p410
aVAnd they send it either to your email
p411
aVor as text messages to your phone.
p412
aVIt is a life-changer.
p413
aVAnd by the way, they don't always get the words right,
p414
aVbecause it's over the phone and all that.
p415
aVSo they attach the audio file at the bottom of the email
p416
aVso you can listen to double-check.
p417
aVThe services are called things like Spinvox,
p418
aVPhonetag \u2014 this is the one I use \u2014
p419
aVCallwave. A lot of people say, "How are they doing this?
p420
aVI don't really want people listening in to my calls."
p421
aVThe executives at these companies told me,
p422
aV"Well we use a proprietary B-to-B, best-of-breed, peer-to-peer soluti \u2014 " you know.
p423
aVI think basically it's like these guys in India with headsets, you know, listening in.
p424
aa(lp425
VThe reason I think that is that
p426
aVon the first day I tried one of these services,
p427
aVI got two voicemail messages. One was from a guy named Michael Stevenson,
p428
aVwhich shouldn't be that hard to transcribe, and it was misspelled.
p429
aVThe other was from my video producer at the Times, whose name is Vijaiy Singh,
p430
aVwith the silent 'h'. Nailed that one.
p431
aa(lp432
V(Laughter)
p433
aa(lp434
VSo you be the judge.
p435
aa(lp436
V(Laughter)
p437
aa(lp438
VAnyway, this service, Callwave, promises
p439
aVthat it's all software \u2014 nobody is listening to your messages.
p440
aVAnd they also promise that they're going to transcribe only the gist
p441
aVof your messages.
p442
aa(lp443
V(Laughter)
p444
aa(lp445
VSo I thought I'd see how that goes.
p446
aVThis is me testing it out.
p447
aa(lp448
V(Video): Hello, this is Michael.
p449
aVHope you're doing well. I'm fine here. Everything's good.
p450
aVHey, I was walking along the street and the sky was blue.
p451
aVAnd your daughter broke her leg at soccer practice.
p452
aVI'm going to have a sandwich for lunch.
p453
aVShe's in room \u2014 emergency room 53W.
p454
aVOK, talk to you later \u2014 bye.
p455
aa(lp456
V(Laughter)
p457
aa(lp458
VI love my job.
p459
aa(lp460
V(Laughter)
p461
aa(lp462
VSo a couple minutes later, this I got by email.
p463
aVIt's a very good transcription. But a couple minutes after that,
p464
aVI got the text message version. Now remember,
p465
aVa text message can only be 160 characters long.
p466
aVSo it had better be the gist of the gist, right?
p467
aVI'm not kidding you. The message said,
p468
aa(lp469
V"Was walking along the street" and "sky was blue" and "emergency"!
p470
aa(lp471
V(Laughter)
p472
aa(lp473
VWhat the f \u2014 ?
p474
aa(lp475
V(Laughter)
p476
aa(lp477
VWell I guess that was the gist.
p478
aa(lp479
V(Laughter)
p480
aa(lp481
VAnd lastly, I just have to talk about this one.
p482
aVThis is my favorite of all time. It's called Popularitydialer.com.
p483
aVBasically, you're going to go on some
p484
aViffy date, or a potentially bad meeting.
p485
aVSo you go and you type in your phone number,
p486
aVand at the exact minute where you want to be called \u2014
p487
aa(lp488
V(Laughter)
p489
aa(lp490
VAnd at that moment your phone will ring.
p491
aVAnd you're like, "I'm sorry. I've got to take this."
p492
aVThe really beautiful thing is,
p493
aVyou know how when somebody's sitting next to you, sometimes they can sort of
p494
aVhear a little bit of the caller.
p495
aVSo they give you a choice
p496
aVof what you want to hear on the other end.
p497
aVHere's the girlfriend.
p498
aa(lp499
VPhone: Hey you, what's going on?
p500
aa(lp501
VDP: I'm kinda, like, giving a talk right now.
p502
aa(lp503
VPhone: Well, that's good.
p504
aa(lp505
VDP: What are you doing?
p506
aa(lp507
VPhone: I was just wondering what you were up to.
p508
aa(lp509
VDP: Right, I can't really talk right now.
p510
aVThis is the \u2014 I love this \u2014 the boss call.
p511
aa(lp512
VPhone: Hey, this is Mr. Johnson calling from the office.
p513
aa(lp514
VDP: Oh, hi, sir.
p515
aa(lp516
VPhone: Did you complete that thing about a month ago? That photocopier training?
p517
aa(lp518
VDP: Oh \u2014 sorry I forgot.
p519
aa(lp520
VPhone: Yeah, well so when was the last time you used the photocopier?
p521
aa(lp522
VDP: It was like three weeks ago.
p523
aa(lp524
VPhone: Well, I don't know if you heard, you might have heard from Lenny, but \u2014
p525
aa(lp526
V(Laughter)
p527
aa(lp528
VI think the biggest change when Internet met phone
p529
aVwas with the iPhone.
p530
aVNot my finest moment in New York Times journalism.
p531
aVIt was when in the fall of 2006,
p532
aVI explained why Apple would never do a cell phone.
p533
aa(lp534
V(Laughter)
p535
aa(lp536
VI looked like a moron. However, my logic was good,
p537
aVbecause \u2014 I don't know if you realize this, but \u2014 until the iPhone came along,
p538
aVthe carriers \u2014 Verizon, AT&T, Cingular \u2014
p539
aVheld veto power over every aspect
p540
aVof every design of every phone.
p541
aVI know the people who worked on the Treo.
p542
aVThey went around to these carriers and said,
p543
aa(lp544
V"Look at these cool features." And Verizon is like, "Hmm, no.
p545
aVI don't think so."
p546
aVIt was not very conducive to innovation.
p547
aVWhat I didn't anticipate was that Steve Jobs
p548
aVwent around and said, "Tell you what \u2014 I'll give you a five-year exclusive
p549
aVif you'll let me design this phone in peace \u2014
p550
aVand you won't even see it till it's done."
p551
aVActually, even so, he was turned down by Verizon and others.
p552
aVFinally Cingular said OK.
p553
aa(lp554
VI'm going to talk about the effect of the iPhone.
p555
aVPlease don't corner me at the party tonight
p556
aVand go, "What are you? An Apple fan boy?"
p557
aV- you know. I'm not.
p558
aVYou can see what I said about it. It's a flawed masterpiece.
p559
aVIt's got bad things and good things. Lets all acknowledge that right now.
p560
aa(lp561
VBut it did change a few things. The first thing it changed
p562
aVwas that all those carriers saw
p563
aVthat they sold 10 million of these things in a year.
p564
aVAnd they said, "Oh my gosh, maybe we've been doing it wrong.
p565
aVMaybe we should let phone designers design the phones."
p566
aa(lp567
V(Applause)
p568
aa(lp569
VAnother thing was that it let 10 million people,
p570
aVfor the first time, experience being online all the time.
p571
aVNot using these 60-dollar-a-month
p572
aVcellular cards for their laptops.
p573
aVI don't understand why we're not there yet.
p574
aVWhen I'm an old man, I'm going to tell my grandchildren,
p575
aV"When I was your age, if I wanted to check my email,
p576
aVI used to drive around town looking for a coffee shop. I did!"
p577
aa(lp578
V(Laughter)
p579
aa(lp580
V"We had wireless base stations that could
p581
aVbroadcast \u2014 yay, about 150 feet across."
p582
aa(lp583
V(Laughter)
p584
aa(lp585
VIt's absurd. We have power outlets
p586
aVin every room of every building. We have running water.
p587
aVWhat's the problem?
p588
aVAnyway \u2014 but this teaches people what it's like.
p589
aVYou have to go to YouTube
p590
aVand type in "iPhone Shuffle."
p591
aVThis guy did a mock video of one
p592
aVthat's one inch square, like the real iPod Shuffle.
p593
aVIt's like, "It only has one button.
p594
aVTouch it and it dials a number at random."
p595
aa(lp596
V(Laughter)
p597
aa(lp598
V"Who the hell is this?"
p599
aa(lp600
V(Laughter)
p601
aa(lp602
VBut the other thing it did
p603
aVis it opened up this idea of an app store.
p604
aVIt downloads right to the phone.
p605
aVAnd you can use the tilt sensor
p606
aVto steer this car using this game.
p607
aVThese programs can use all the components
p608
aVof the iPhone \u2014 the touch screen.
p609
aVThis is the Etch-A-Sketch program \u2014 the theme of EG 2008.
p610
aVYou know how you erase it?
p611
aVOf course. You shake it.
p612
aVRight, of course. We shake it to erase, like this.
p613
aa(lp614
VThey have 10,000 of these programs.
p615
aVThis is the translator program. They have every language in the world.
p616
aVYou type in what you want, and it gives you the translation.
p617
aVThis is amazing. This is Midomi.
p618
aVA song is running through your head \u2014
p619
aVyou sing it into the thing:
p620
aVdo do do do do, da da da da da da, da dum ...
p621
aVOK, you tap, "Done" and it will find out the song and play it for you.
p622
aVI know. It's insane, right?
p623
aa(lp624
VThis is Pandora. Free Internet radio. Not just free Internet radio \u2014
p625
aVyou type in a band or a song name.
p626
aVIt will immediately play you that song or that band.
p627
aVIt has a thumbs-up and a thumbs-down.
p628
aVYou say if you like this song or not.
p629
aVIf you like it, it tries another song on you
p630
aVfrom a different band, with the same instrumentation, vocals,
p631
aVtheme and tempo.
p632
aVIf you like that one, or don't like it,
p633
aVyou do thumbs-up and thumbs-down. Over time it tailors the songs
p634
aVso that it completely stops playing bad songs.
p635
aVIt eventually only plays songs you like.
p636
aa(lp637
VThis is Urbanspoon. You're in a city. It knows from GPS where you're standing.
p638
aVYou want to find a place to eat. You shake it.
p639
aVIt proposes a restaurant.
p640
aVIt gives you the price, and the location and ratings.
p641
aVVideo: I'm not going all the way to Flushing.
p642
aVAnyway, just amazing, amazing things.
p643
aVOf course, its not just about the iPhone.
p644
aa(lp645
VThe iPhone broke the dyke, the wall.
p646
aVBut now it's everybody else. So Google has done their own Android operating system
p647
aVthat will soon be on handsets \u2014 phones from 34 companies.
p648
aVTouch screen \u2014 very, very nice.
p649
aVAlso with its own app store, where you can download programs.
p650
aa(lp651
VThis is amazing. In the wake of all this,
p652
aVVerizon, the most calcified, corporate,
p653
aVconservative carrier of all,
p654
aVsaid, "You can use any phone you want on our network."
p655
aVI love the Wired headline:
p656
aVPigs Fly, Hell Freezes Over
p657
aVand Verizon Opens Up Its Network \u2014 No. Really.
p658
aa(lp659
VSo everything is changing. We've entered
p660
aVa new world of innovation, where the cell phone becomes your laptop,
p661
aVcustomized the way you want it.
p662
aVEvery cell phone is unique. There is software that you can add on.
p663
aVCan I do one more one-minute song? Thank you.
p664
aa(lp665
V(Applause)
p666
aa(lp667
VJust to round it up \u2014 this is the new Apple Power Music Stand.
p668
aVIt's only three pounds,
p669
aVor 12 if you install Microsoft Office.
p670
aa(lp671
V(Laughter)
p672
aa(lp673
VSorry, that was mean.
p674
aVThis is a song I did for the New York Times website as a music video.
p675
aVLadies and gentlemen, for seven blissful hours
p676
aVit was the number one video on YouTube.
p677
aV(To the tune of "My Way")
p678
aa(lp679
VAnd now the end is near.
p680
aVI'm sick to death
p681
aVof this old cell phone.
p682
aVBad sound, the signal's weak,
p683
aVthe software stinks.
p684
aVA made-in-Hell phone.
p685
aVI've heard there's something new \u2014
p686
aVa million times more rad than my phone.
p687
aVI too will join the cult.
p688
aVI want an iPhone.
p689
aVConcerns \u2014 I have a few. It's got some flaws;
p690
aVwe may just face it.
p691
aVNo keys, no memory card,
p692
aVthe battery's sealed \u2014
p693
aVyou can't replace it.
p694
aVBut God, this thing is sweet.
p695
aVA multitouch, iPod, Wi-Fi phone.
p696
aVYou had me from, "Hello."
p697
aVI want an iPhone.
p698
aVI want to touch its precious screen.
p699
aVI want to wipe the smudges clean.
p700
aVI want my friends to look and drool.
p701
aVI want to say, "Look \u2014 now I'm cool"
p702
aVI stood in line and I'll get mine.
p703
aVI want an iPhone.
p704
aVFor what is a man?
p705
aVWhat has he got? If not iPhone,
p706
aVthen he's got squat.
p707
aVIt's all the things a phone should be.
p708
aVWho cares if it's AT&T?
p709
aVI took a stand, paid half a grand!
p710
aVAnd I got an iPhone!
p711
aa(lp712
V(Applause)
p713
aa(lp714
VThank you. Thank you very much.
