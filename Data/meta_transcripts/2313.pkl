VWhat do you do when you have a headache?
p4
aVYou swallow an aspirin.
p5
aVBut for this pill to get to your head, where the pain is,
p6
aVit goes through your stomach, intestines and various other organs first.
p7
aa(lp8
VSwallowing pills is the most effective and painless way of delivering
p9
aVany medication in the body.
p10
aVThe downside, though, is that swallowing any medication leads to its dilution.
p11
aVAnd this is a big problem, particularly in HIV patients.
p12
aVWhen they take their anti-HIV drugs,
p13
aVthese drugs are good for lowering the virus in the blood,
p14
aVand increasing the CD4 cell counts.
p15
aVBut they are also notorious for their adverse side effects,
p16
aVbut mostly bad, because they get diluted by the time they get to the blood,
p17
aVand worse, by the time they get to the sites
p18
aVwhere it matters most: within the HIV viral reservoirs.
p19
aVThese areas in the body \u2014 such as the lymph nodes,
p20
aVthe nervous system, as well as the lungs \u2014
p21
aVwhere the virus is sleeping,
p22
aVand will not readily get delivered in the blood
p23
aVof patients that are under consistent anti-HIV drugs therapy.
p24
aVHowever, upon discontinuation of therapy,
p25
aVthe virus can awake and infect new cells in the blood.
p26
aa(lp27
VNow, all this is a big problem in treating HIV with the current drug treatment,
p28
aVwhich is a life-long treatment that must be swallowed by patients.
p29
aVOne day, I sat and thought,
p30
aV"Can we deliver anti-HIV directly within its reservoir sites,
p31
aVwithout the risk of drug dilution?"
p32
aVAs a laser scientist, the answer was just before my eyes:
p33
aVLasers, of course.
p34
aVIf they can be used for dentistry,
p35
aVfor diabetic wound-healing and surgery,
p36
aVthey can be used for anything imaginable,
p37
aVincluding transporting drugs into cells.
p38
aa(lp39
VAs a matter of fact, we are currently using laser pulses
p40
aVto poke or drill extremely tiny holes,
p41
aVwhich open and close almost immediately in HIV-infected cells,
p42
aVin order to deliver drugs within them.
p43
aV"How is that possible?" you may ask.
p44
aVWell, we shine a very powerful but super-tiny laser beam
p45
aVonto the membrane of HIV-infected cells
p46
aVwhile these cells are immersed in liquid containing the drug.
p47
aVThe laser pierces the cell, while the cell swallows the drug
p48
aVin a matter of microseconds.
p49
aVBefore you even know it,
p50
aVthe induced hole becomes immediately repaired.
p51
aa(lp52
VNow, we are currently testing this technology in test tubes
p53
aVor in Petri dishes,
p54
aVbut the goal is to get this technology in the human body,
p55
aVapply it in the human body.
p56
aV"How is that possible?" you may ask.
p57
aVWell, the answer is: through a three-headed device.
p58
aVUsing the first head, which is our laser,
p59
aVwe will make an incision in the site of infection.
p60
aVUsing the second head, which is a camera,
p61
aVwe meander to the site of infection.
p62
aVFinally, using a third head, which is a drug-spreading sprinkler,
p63
aVwe deliver the drugs directly at the site of infection,
p64
aVwhile the laser is again used to poke those cells open.
p65
aa(lp66
VWell, this might not seem like much right now.
p67
aVBut one day, if successful, this technology can lead
p68
aVto complete eradication of HIV in the body.
p69
aVYes. A cure for HIV.
p70
aVThis is every HIV researcher's dream \u2014
p71
aVin our case, a cure lead by lasers.
p72
aa(lp73
VThank you.
