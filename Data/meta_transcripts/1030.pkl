(lp3
VIt sure used to be a lot easier to be from Iceland,
p4
aVbecause until a couple of years ago,
p5
aVpeople knew hardly anything about us,
p6
aVand I could basically come out here
p7
aVand say only good things about us.
p8
aVBut in the last couple of years
p9
aVwe've become infamous for a couple of things.
p10
aVFirst, of course, the economic meltdown.
p11
aVIt actually got so bad
p12
aVthat somebody put our country up for sale on eBay.
p13
aV(Laughter)
p14
aVNinety-nine pence was the starting price
p15
aVand no reserve.
p16
aVThen there was the volcano
p17
aVthat interrupted the travel plans
p18
aVof almost all of you and many of your friends,
p19
aVincluding President Obama.
p20
aVBy the way, the pronunciation
p21
aVis "Eyjafjallajokull."
p22
aVNone of your media got it right.
p23
aa(lp24
V(Laughter)
p25
aa(lp26
VBut I'm not here to share these stories
p27
aVabout these two things exactly.
p28
aVI'm here to tell you the story of Audur Capital,
p29
aVwhich is a financial firm founded by me
p30
aVand Kristin \u2014 who you see in the picture \u2014
p31
aVin the spring of 2007,
p32
aVjust over a year before the economic collapse hit.
p33
aVWhy would two women
p34
aVwho were enjoying successful careers in investment banking
p35
aVin the corporate sector
p36
aVleave to found a financial services firm?
p37
aVWell let it suffice to say
p38
aVthat we felt a bit overwhelmed
p39
aVwith testosterone.
p40
aVAnd I'm not here to say
p41
aVthat men are to blame for the crisis
p42
aVand what happened in my country.
p43
aVBut I can surely tell you that in my country,
p44
aVmuch like on Wall Street and the city of London and elsewhere,
p45
aVmen were at the helm
p46
aVof the game of the financial sector,
p47
aVand that kind of lack of diversity
p48
aVand sameness
p49
aVleads to disastrous problems.
p50
aa(lp51
V(Applause)
p52
aa(lp53
VSo we decided, a bit fed-up with this world
p54
aVand also with the strong feeling in our stomach
p55
aVthat this wasn't sustainable,
p56
aVto found a financial services firm
p57
aVbased on our values,
p58
aVand we decided to incorporate feminine values
p59
aVinto the world of finance.
p60
aVRaised quite a few eyebrows in Iceland.
p61
aVWe weren't known
p62
aVas the typical "women" women
p63
aVin Iceland up until then.
p64
aVSo it was almost like coming out of the closet
p65
aVto actually talk about the fact that we were women
p66
aVand that we believed that we had a set of values
p67
aVand a way of doing business
p68
aVthat would be more sustainable
p69
aVthan what we had experienced until then.
p70
aVAnd we got a great group of people to join us \u2014
p71
aVprincipled people with great skills,
p72
aVand investors with a vision
p73
aVand values to match ours.
p74
aVAnd together we got through the eye of the financial storm in Iceland
p75
aVwithout taking any direct losses to our equity
p76
aVor to the funds of our clients.
p77
aVAnd although I want to thank
p78
aVthe talented people of our company
p79
aVforemost for that \u2014
p80
aVand also there's a factor of luck and timing \u2014
p81
aVwe are absolutely convinced
p82
aVthat we did this because of our values.
p83
aa(lp84
VSo let me share with you our values.
p85
aVWe believe in risk awareness.
p86
aVWhat does that mean?
p87
aVWe believe that you should always understand the risks that you're taking,
p88
aVand we will not invest
p89
aVin things we don't understand.
p90
aVNot a complicated thing.
p91
aVBut in 2007,
p92
aVat the height of the sub-prime
p93
aVand all the complicated financial structures,
p94
aVit was quite opposite
p95
aVto the reckless risk-taking behaviors
p96
aVthat we saw on the market.
p97
aVWe also believe in straight-talking,
p98
aVtelling it as it is,
p99
aVusing simple language that people understand,
p100
aVtelling people about the downsides
p101
aVas well as the potential upsides,
p102
aVand even telling the bad news that no one wants to utter,
p103
aVlike our lack of belief in the sustainability
p104
aVof the Icelandic financial sector
p105
aVthat already we had
p106
aVmonths before the collapse hit us.
p107
aVAnd, although we do work in the financial sector,
p108
aVwhere Excel is king,
p109
aVwe believe in emotional capital.
p110
aVAnd we believe
p111
aVthat doing emotional due diligence
p112
aVis just as important
p113
aVas doing financial due diligence.
p114
aVIt is actually people
p115
aVthat make money and lose money,
p116
aVnot Excel spreadsheets.
p117
aa(lp118
V(Applause)
p119
aa(lp120
VLast, but not least,
p121
aVwe believe in profit with principles.
p122
aVWe care how we make our profit.
p123
aVSo while we want to make economic profit for ourselves and our customers,
p124
aVwe are willing to do it with a long-term view,
p125
aVand we like to have a wider definition of profits
p126
aVthan just the economic profit in the next quarter.
p127
aVSo we like to see profits,
p128
aVplus positive social
p129
aVand environmental benefits, when we invest.
p130
aa(lp131
VBut it wasn't just about the values,
p132
aValthough we are convinced that they matter.
p133
aVIt was also about a business opportunity.
p134
aVIt's the female trend, and it's the sustainability trend,
p135
aVthat are going to create
p136
aVsome of the most interesting investment opportunities
p137
aVin the years to come.
p138
aVThe whole thing about the female trend
p139
aVis not about women being better than men;
p140
aVit is actually about
p141
aVwomen being different from men,
p142
aVbringing different values and different ways to the table.
p143
aVSo what do you get? You get better decision-making,
p144
aVand you get less herd behavior,
p145
aVand both of those things hit your bottom line
p146
aVwith very positive results.
p147
aa(lp148
VBut one has to wonder,
p149
aVnow that we've had this financial sector collapse upon us in Iceland \u2014
p150
aVand by the way, Europe looks pretty bad right now,
p151
aVand many would say that you in America
p152
aVare heading for some more trouble as well.
p153
aVNow that we've had all that happen,
p154
aVand we have all this data out there
p155
aVtelling us that it's much better to have diversity
p156
aVaround the decision-making tables,
p157
aVwill we see business and finance change?
p158
aVWill government change?
p159
aa(lp160
VWell I'll give you my straight talk about this.
p161
aVI have days that I believe,
p162
aVbut I have days that I'm full of doubt.
p163
aVHave you seen the incredible urge out there
p164
aVto rebuild the very things that failed us?
p165
aV(Applause)
p166
aVEinstein said
p167
aVthat this was the definition of insanity \u2014
p168
aVto do the same things
p169
aVover and over again,
p170
aVhoping for a different outcome.
p171
aVSo I guess the world is insane,
p172
aVbecause I see entirely too much
p173
aVof doing the same things over and over again,
p174
aVhoping that this time it's not going to collapse upon us.
p175
aVI want to see more revolutionary thinking,
p176
aVand I remain hopeful.
p177
aVLike TED, I believe in people.
p178
aVAnd I know that consumers
p179
aVare becoming more conscious,
p180
aVand they are going to start voting with their wallets,
p181
aVand they are going to change the face
p182
aVof business and finance from the outside,
p183
aVif they don't do it from the inside.
p184
aa(lp185
VBut I'm more of the revolutionary,
p186
aVand I should be; I'm from Iceland.
p187
aVWe have a long history
p188
aVof strong, courageous, independent women,
p189
aVever since the Viking age.
p190
aVAnd I want to tell you when
p191
aVI first realized that women matter to the economy
p192
aVand to the society,
p193
aVI was seven \u2014 it happened to be my mother's birthday \u2014
p194
aVOctober 24, 1975.
p195
aVWomen in Iceland took the day off.
p196
aVFrom work or from home, they took the day off,
p197
aVand nothing worked in Iceland.
p198
aV(Laughter)
p199
aVThey marched into the center of Reykjavik,
p200
aVand they put women's issues onto the agenda.
p201
aVAnd some say this was the start of a global movement.
p202
aVFor me it was the start of a long journey,
p203
aVbut I decided that day to matter.
p204
aVFive years later,
p205
aVIceland elected Vigdis Finnbogadottir as their president \u2014
p206
aVfirst female to become head of state,
p207
aVsingle mom,
p208
aVa breast cancer survivor
p209
aVwho had had one of her breasts removed.
p210
aVAnd at one of the campaign sessions,
p211
aVshe had one of her male contenders
p212
aVallude to the fact that she couldn't become president \u2014
p213
aVshe was a woman, and even half a woman.
p214
aVThat night she won the election,
p215
aVbecause she came back \u2014
p216
aVnot just because of his crappy behavior \u2014
p217
aVbut she came back and said,
p218
aV"Well, I'm actually not going to breastfeed the Icelandic nation;
p219
aVI'm going to lead it."
p220
aa(lp221
V(Applause)
p222
aa(lp223
VSo I've had incredibly many
p224
aVwomen role models
p225
aVthat have influenced who I am and where I am today.
p226
aVBut in spite of that,
p227
aVI went through the first 10 or 15 years of my career
p228
aVmostly in denial of being a woman.
p229
aVStarted in corporate America,
p230
aVand I was absolutely convinced
p231
aVthat it was just about the individual,
p232
aVthat women and men would have just the same opportunities.
p233
aVBut I've come to conclude lately
p234
aVthat it isn't like that.
p235
aVWe are not the same,
p236
aVand it's great. Because of our differences,
p237
aVwe create and sustain life.
p238
aVSo we should embrace our difference and aim for challenge.
p239
aa(lp240
VThe final thought I want to leave with you
p241
aVis that I'm fed up with this tyranny
p242
aVof either/or choices in life \u2014
p243
aVeither it's men or it's women.
p244
aVWe need to start embracing the beauty of balance.
p245
aVSo let's move away
p246
aVfrom thinking about business here and philanthropy there,
p247
aVand let's start thinking about
p248
aVdoing good business.
p249
aVThat's how we change the world. That's the only sustainable future.
p250
aa(lp251
VThank you.
