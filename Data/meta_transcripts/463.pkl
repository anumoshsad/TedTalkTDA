VThere's a great big elephant in the room called the economy.
p4
aVSo let's start talking about that.
p5
aVI wanted to give you a current picture of the economy.
p6
aVThat's what I have behind myself.
p7
aa(lp8
V(Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
VBut of course what we have to remember is this.
p11
aVAnd what you have to think about is,
p12
aVwhen you're dancing in the flames, what's next?
p13
aVSo what I'm going to try to do in the next 17 and a half minutes
p14
aVis I'm going to talk first about the flames \u2014
p15
aVwhere we are in the economy \u2014
p16
aVand then I'm going to take three trends
p17
aVthat have taken place at TED over the last 25 years
p18
aVand that will take place in this conference
p19
aVand I will try and bring them together.
p20
aVAnd I will try and give you a sense of what the ultimate reboot looks like.
p21
aVThose three trends are
p22
aVthe ability to engineer cells,
p23
aVthe ability to engineer tissues,
p24
aVand robots.
p25
aVAnd somehow it will all make sense.
p26
aa(lp27
VBut anyway, let's start with the economy.
p28
aVThere's a couple of really big problems that are still sitting there.
p29
aVOne is leverage.
p30
aVAnd the problem with leverage is
p31
aVit makes the U.S. financial system look like this.
p32
aa(lp33
V(Laughter)
p34
aa(lp35
VSo, a normal commercial bank has nine to 10 times leverage.
p36
aVThat means for every dollar you deposit, it loans out about nine or 10.
p37
aVA normal investment bank is not a deposit bank,
p38
aVit's an investment bank;
p39
aVit has 15 to 20 times.
p40
aVIt turns out that B of A in September had 32 times.
p41
aVAnd your friendly Citibank had 47 times.
p42
aVOops.
p43
aVThat means every bad loan goes bad 47 times over.
p44
aVAnd that, of course, is the reason why all of you
p45
aVare making such generous and wonderful donations
p46
aVto these nice folks.
p47
aVAnd as you think about that,
p48
aVyou've got to wonder: so what do banks have in store for you now?
p49
aV(Laughter)
p50
aVIt ain't pretty.
p51
aa(lp52
VThe government, meanwhile, has been acting like Santa Claus.
p53
aVWe all love Santa Claus, right?
p54
aVBut the problem with Santa Clause is,
p55
aVif you look at the mandatory spending of what these folks have been doing
p56
aVand promising folks,
p57
aVit turned out that in 1967, 38 percent was mandatory spending
p58
aVon what we call "entitlements."
p59
aVAnd then by 2007 it was 68 percent.
p60
aVAnd we weren't supposed to run into 100 percent until about 2030.
p61
aVExcept we've been so busy giving away a trillion here, a trillion there,
p62
aVthat we've brought that date of reckoning forward
p63
aVto about 2017.
p64
aVAnd we thought we were going to be able to lay these debts off on our kids,
p65
aVbut, guess what?
p66
aVWe're going to start to pay them.
p67
aVAnd the problem with this stuff is, now that the bill's come due,
p68
aVit turns out Santa isn't quite as cute when it's summertime.
p69
aVRight?
p70
aa(lp71
V(Laughter)
p72
aa(lp73
VHere's some advice from one of the largest investors in the United States.
p74
aVThis guy runs the China Investment Corporation.
p75
aVHe is the main buyer of U.S. Treasury bonds.
p76
aVAnd he gave an interview in December.
p77
aVHere's his first bit of advice.
p78
aVAnd here's his second bit of advice.
p79
aVAnd, by the way,
p80
aVthe Chinese Prime Minister reiterated this at Davos last Sunday.
p81
aVThis stuff is getting serious enough
p82
aVthat if we don't start paying attention to the deficit,
p83
aVwe're going to end up losing the dollar.
p84
aVAnd then all bets are off.
p85
aa(lp86
VLet me show you what it looks like.
p87
aVI think I can safely say
p88
aVthat I'm the only trillionaire in this room.
p89
aVThis is an actual bill.
p90
aVAnd it's 10 triliion dollars.
p91
aVThe only problem with this bill is it's not really worth very much.
p92
aVThat was eight bucks last week, four bucks this week,
p93
aVa buck next week.
p94
aVAnd that's what happens to currencies when you don't stand behind them.
p95
aVSo the next time somebody as cute as this shows up on your doorstep,
p96
aVand sometimes this creature's called Chrysler and sometimes Ford and sometimes ... whatever you want \u2014
p97
aVyou've just got to say no.
p98
aVAnd you've got to start banishing a word that's called "entitlement."
p99
aVAnd the reason we have to do that in the short term
p100
aVis because we have just run out of cash.
p101
aa(lp102
VIf you look at the federal budget, this is what it looks like.
p103
aVThe orange slice is what's discretionary.
p104
aVEverything else is mandated.
p105
aVIt makes no difference if we cut out the bridges to Alaska in the overall scheme of things.
p106
aVSo what we have to start thinking about doing
p107
aVis capping our medical spending
p108
aVbecause that's a monster that's simply going to eat the entire budget.
p109
aVWe've got to start thinking about asking people
p110
aVto retire a little bit later.
p111
aVIf you're 60 to 65 you retire on time.
p112
aVYour 401(k) just got nailed.
p113
aVIf you're 50 to 60 we want you to work two years more.
p114
aVIf you're under 50 we want you to work four more years.
p115
aVThe reason why that's reasonable is,
p116
aVwhen your grandparents were given Social Security,
p117
aVthey got it at 65 and were expected to check out at 68.
p118
aVSixty-eight is young today.
p119
aVWe've also got to cut the military about three percent a year.
p120
aa(lp121
VWe've got to limit other mandatory spending.
p122
aVWe've got to quit borrowing as much,
p123
aVbecause otherwise the interest is going to eat that whole pie.
p124
aVAnd we've got to end up with a smaller government.
p125
aVAnd if we don't start changing this trend line,
p126
aVwe are going to lose the dollar
p127
aVand start to look like Iceland.
p128
aVI got what you're thinking.
p129
aVThis is going to happen when hell freezes over.
p130
aVBut let me remind you this December it did snow in Vegas.
p131
aa(lp132
V(Laughter)
p133
aa(lp134
VHere's what happens if you don't address this stuff.
p135
aVSo, Japan had a fiscal real estate crisis
p136
aVback in the late '80s.
p137
aVAnd its 225 largest companies today
p138
aVare worth one quarter of what they were 18 years ago.
p139
aVWe don't fix this now,
p140
aVhow would you like to see a Dow 3,500 in 2026?
p141
aVBecause that's the consequence of not dealing with this stuff.
p142
aVAnd unless you want this person
p143
aVto not just become the CFO of Florida, but the United States,
p144
aVwe'd better deal with this stuff.
p145
aVThat's the short term. That's the flame part.
p146
aVThat's the financial crisis.
p147
aa(lp148
VNow, right behind the financial crisis there's a second and bigger wave
p149
aVthat we need to talk about.
p150
aVThat wave is much larger, much more powerful,
p151
aVand that's of course the wave of technology.
p152
aVAnd what's really important in this stuff is,
p153
aVas we cut, we also have to grow.
p154
aVAmong other things, because startup companies
p155
aVare .02 percent of U.S. GDP investmentm
p156
aVand they're about 17.8 percent of output.
p157
aVIt's groups like that in this room that generate the future of the U.S. economy.
p158
aVAnd that's what we've got to keep growing.
p159
aVWe don't have to keep growing these bridges to nowhere.
p160
aVSo let's bring a romance novelist into this conversation.
p161
aVAnd that's where these three trends come together.
p162
aVThat's where the ability to engineer microbes,
p163
aVthe ability to engineer tissues,
p164
aVand the ability to engineer robots
p165
aVbegin to lead to a reboot.
p166
aVAnd let me recap some of the stuff you've seen.
p167
aa(lp168
VCraig Venter showed up last year
p169
aVand showed you the first fully programmable cell that acts like hardware
p170
aVwhere you can insert DNA and have it boot up as a different species.
p171
aVIn parallel, the folks at MIT
p172
aVhave been building a standard registry of biological parts.
p173
aVSo think of it as a Radio Shack for biology.
p174
aVYou can go out and get your proteins, your RNA, your DNA, whatever.
p175
aVAnd start building stuff.
p176
aVIn 2006 they brought together high school students and college students
p177
aVand started to build these little odd creatures.
p178
aVThey just happened to be alive instead of circuit boards.
p179
aa(lp180
VHere was one of the first things they built.
p181
aVSo, cells have this cycle.
p182
aVFirst they don't grow.
p183
aVThen they grow exponentially.
p184
aVThen they stop growing.
p185
aVGraduate students wanted a way of telling which stage they were in.
p186
aVSo they engineered these cells
p187
aVso that when they're growing in the exponential phase,
p188
aVthey would smell like wintergreen.
p189
aVAnd when they stopped growing they would smell like bananas.
p190
aVAnd you could tell very easily when your experiment was working
p191
aVand wasn't, and where it was in the phase.
p192
aa(lp193
VThis got a bit more complicated two years later.
p194
aVTwenty-one countries came together. Dozens of teams.
p195
aVThey started competing.
p196
aVThe team from Rice University started to engineer the substance in red wine
p197
aVthat makes red wine good for you
p198
aVinto beer.
p199
aVSo you take resveratrol and you put it into beer.
p200
aVOf course, one of the judges is wandering by, and he goes,
p201
aV"Wow! Cancer-fighting beer! There is a God."
p202
aa(lp203
V(Laughter)
p204
aa(lp205
VThe team from Taiwan was a little bit more ambitious.
p206
aVThey tried to engineer bacterias in such a way
p207
aVthat they would act as your kidneys.
p208
aVFour years ago, I showed you this picture.
p209
aVAnd people oohed and ahhed,
p210
aVbecause Cliff Tabin had been able to grow an extra wing on a chicken.
p211
aVAnd that was very cool stuff back then.
p212
aVBut now moving from bacterial engineering to tissue engineering,
p213
aVlet me show you what's happened in that period of time.
p214
aa(lp215
VTwo years ago, you saw this creature.
p216
aVAn almost-extinct animal from Xochimilco, Mexico
p217
aVcalled an axolotl
p218
aVthat can re-generate its limbs.
p219
aVYou can freeze half its heart. It regrows.
p220
aVYou can freeze half the brain. It regrows.
p221
aVIt's almost like leaving Congress.
p222
aV(Laughter)
p223
aVBut now, you don't have to have the animal itself to regenerate,
p224
aVbecause you can build cloned mice molars in Petri dishes.
p225
aVAnd, of course if you can build mice molars in Petri dishes,
p226
aVyou can grow human molars in Petri dishes.
p227
aVThis should not surprise you, right?
p228
aVI mean, you're born with no teeth.
p229
aVYou give away all your teeth to the tooth fairy.
p230
aVYou re-grow a set of teeth.
p231
aVBut then if you lose one of those second set of teeth, they don't regrow,
p232
aVunless, if you're a lawyer.
p233
aa(lp234
V(Laughter)
p235
aa(lp236
VBut, of course, for most of us,
p237
aVwe know how to grow teeth, and therefore we can take adult stem teeth,
p238
aVput them on a biodegradable mold, re-grow a tooth,
p239
aVand simply implant it.
p240
aVAnd we can do it with other things.
p241
aVSo, a Spanish woman who was dying of T.B. had a donor trachea,
p242
aVthey took all the cells off the trachea,
p243
aVthey spraypainted her stem cells onto that cartilage.
p244
aVShe regrew her own trachea,
p245
aVand 72 hours later it was implanted.
p246
aVShe's now running around with her kids.
p247
aVThis is going on in Tony Atala's lab in Wake Forest
p248
aVwhere he is re-growing ears for injured soldiers,
p249
aVand he's also re-growing bladders.
p250
aVSo there are now nine women walking around Boston
p251
aVwith re-grown bladders,
p252
aVwhich is much more pleasant than walking around with a whole bunch of plastic bags
p253
aVfor the rest of your life.
p254
aa(lp255
VThis is kind of getting boring, right?
p256
aVI mean, you understand where this story's going.
p257
aVBut, I mean it gets more interesting.
p258
aVLast year, this group was able to take all the cells off a heart,
p259
aVleaving just the cartilage.
p260
aVThen, they sprayed stem cells onto that heart, from a mouse.
p261
aVThose stem cells self-organized, and that heart started to beat.
p262
aVLife happens.
p263
aa(lp264
VThis may be one of the ultimate papers.
p265
aVThis was done in Japan and in the U.S., published at the same time,
p266
aVand it rebooted skin cells into stem cells, last year.
p267
aVThat meant that you can take the stuff right here,
p268
aVand turn it into almost anything in your body.
p269
aVAnd this is becoming common, it's moving very quickly,
p270
aVit's moving in a whole series of places.
p271
aa(lp272
VThird trend: robots.
p273
aVThose of us of a certain age grew up expecting that by now
p274
aVwe would have Rosie the Robot from "The Jetsons" in our house.
p275
aVAnd all we've got is a Roomba.
p276
aV(Laughter)
p277
aVWe also thought we'd have this robot to warn us of danger.
p278
aVDidn't happen.
p279
aVAnd these were robots engineered for a flat world, right?
p280
aVSo, Rosie runs around on skates
p281
aVand the other one ran on flat threads.
p282
aVIf you don't have a flat world, that's not good,
p283
aVwhich is why the robot's we're designing today are a little different.
p284
aa(lp285
VThis is Boston Dynamics' "BigDog."
p286
aVAnd this is about as close as you can get to a physical Turing test.
p287
aVO.K., so let me remind you, a Turing test is where you've got a wall,
p288
aVyou're talking to somebody on the other side of the wall,
p289
aVand when you don't know if that thing is human or animal \u2014
p290
aVthat's when computers have reached human intelligence.
p291
aVThis is not an intelligence Turing rest,
p292
aVbut this is as close as you can get to a physical Turing test.
p293
aVAnd this stuff is moving very quickly,
p294
aVand by the way, that thing can carry about 350 pounds of weight.
p295
aVThese are not the only interesting robots.
p296
aVYou've also got flies, the size of flies,
p297
aVthat are being made by Robert Wood at Harvard.
p298
aVYou've got Stickybots that are being made at Stanford.
p299
aVAnd as you bring these things together,
p300
aVas you bring cells, biological tissue engineering and mechanics together,
p301
aVyou begin to get some really odd questions.
p302
aa(lp303
VIn the last Olympics, this gentleman,
p304
aVwho had several world records in the Special Olympics,
p305
aVtried to run in the normal Olympics.
p306
aVThe only issue with Oscar Pistorius
p307
aVis he was born without bones in the lower part of his legs.
p308
aVHe came within about a second of qualifying.
p309
aVHe sued to be allowed to run,
p310
aVand he won the suit,
p311
aVbut didn't qualify by time.
p312
aVNext Olympics, you can bet that Oscar, or one of Oscar's successors,
p313
aVis going to make the time.
p314
aVAnd two or three Olympics after that, they are going to be unbeatable.
p315
aa(lp316
VAnd as you bring these trends together, and as you think of what it means
p317
aVto take people who are profoundly deaf, who can now begin to hear \u2014
p318
aVI mean, remember the evolution of hearing aids, right?
p319
aVI mean, your grandparents had these great big cones,
p320
aVand then your parents had these odd boxes
p321
aVthat would squawk at odd times during dinner,
p322
aVand now we have these little buds that nobody sees.
p323
aVAnd now you have cochlear implants
p324
aVthat go into people's heads and allow the deaf to begin to hear.
p325
aVNow, they can't hear as well as you and I can.
p326
aVBut, in 10 or 15 machine generations they will,
p327
aVand these are machine generations, not human generations.
p328
aVAnd about two or three years after they can hear as well as you and I can,
p329
aVthey'll be able to hear maybe how bats sing, or how whales talk,
p330
aVor how dogs talk, and other types of tonal scales.
p331
aVThey'll be able to focus their hearing,
p332
aVthey'll be able to increase the sensitivity, decrease the sensitivity,
p333
aVdo a series of things that we can't do.
p334
aa(lp335
VAnd the same thing is happening in eyes.
p336
aVThis is a group in Germany that's beginning to engineer eyes
p337
aVso that people who are blind can begin to see light and dark.
p338
aVVery primitive.
p339
aVAnd then they'll be able to see shape.
p340
aVAnd then they'll be able to see color, and then they'll be able to see in definition,
p341
aVand one day, they'll see as well as you and I can.
p342
aVAnd a couple of years after that, they'll be able to see in ultraviolet,
p343
aVthey'll be able to see in infrared, they'll be able to focus their eyes,
p344
aVthey'll be able to come into a microfocus.
p345
aVThey'll do stuff you and I can't do.
p346
aVAll of these things are coming together,
p347
aVand it's a particularly important thing to understand,
p348
aVas we worry about the flames of the present,
p349
aVto keep an eye on the future.
p350
aa(lp351
VAnd, of course, the future is looking back 200 years,
p352
aVbecause next week is the 200th anniversary of Darwin's birth.
p353
aVAnd it's the 150th anniversary of the publication of "The Origin of Species."
p354
aVAnd Darwin, of course, argued that evolution is a natural state.
p355
aVIt is a natural state in everything that is alive, including hominids.
p356
aVThere have actually been 22 species of hominids
p357
aVthat have been around, have evolved, have wandered in different places,
p358
aVhave gone extinct.
p359
aVIt is common for hominids to evolve.
p360
aVAnd that's the reason why, as you look at the hominid fossil record,
p361
aVerectus, and heidelbergensis, and floresiensis, and Neanderthals,
p362
aVand Homo sapiens, all overlap.
p363
aVThe common state of affairs is to have overlapping versions of hominids,
p364
aVnot one.
p365
aa(lp366
VAnd as you think of the implications of that,
p367
aVhere's a brief history of the universe.
p368
aVThe universe was created 13.7 billion years ago,
p369
aVand then you created all the stars, and all the planets,
p370
aVand all the galaxies, and all the Milky Ways.
p371
aVAnd then you created Earth about 4.5 billion years ago,
p372
aVand then you got life about four billion years ago,
p373
aVand then you got hominids about 0.006 billion years ago,
p374
aVand then you got our version of hominids about 0.0015 billion years ago.
p375
aVTa-dah!
p376
aVMaybe the reason for thr creation of the universe,
p377
aVand all the galaxies, and all the planets, and all the energy,
p378
aVand all the dark energy, and all the rest of stuff
p379
aVis to create what's in this room.
p380
aVMaybe not.
p381
aVThat would be a mildly arrogant viewpoint.
p382
aV(Laughter)
p383
aVSo, if that's not the purpose of the universe, then what's next?
p384
aV(Laughter)
p385
aa(lp386
VI think what we're going to see is we're going to see a different species of hominid.
p387
aVI think we're going to move from a Homo sapiens into a Homo evolutis.
p388
aVAnd I think this isn't 1,000 years out.
p389
aVI think most of us are going to glance at it,
p390
aVand our grandchildren are going to begin to live it.
p391
aVAnd a Homo evolutis brings together these three trends
p392
aVinto a hominid that takes direct and deliberate control
p393
aVover the evolution of his species, her species and other species.
p394
aVAnd that, of course, would be the ultimate reboot.
p395
