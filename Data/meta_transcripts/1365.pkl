VGabriel García Márquez is one of my favorite writers,
p4
aVfor his storytelling,
p5
aVbut even more, I think,
p6
aVfor the beauty and precision of his prose.
p7
aVAnd whether it's the opening line from "One Hundred Years of Solitude"
p8
aVor the fantastical stream of consciousness
p9
aVin "Autumn of the Patriarch,"
p10
aVwhere the words rush by,
p11
aVpage after page of unpunctuated imagery
p12
aVsweeping the reader along
p13
aVlike some wild river
p14
aVtwisting through a primal South American jungle,
p15
aVreading Márquez is a visceral experience.
p16
aVWhich struck me as particularly remarkable
p17
aVduring one session with the novel
p18
aVwhen I realized that I was being swept along
p19
aVon this remarkable, vivid journey
p20
aVin translation.
p21
aa(lp22
VNow I was a comparative literature major in college,
p23
aVwhich is like an English major,
p24
aVonly instead of being stuck studying Chaucer for three months,
p25
aVwe got to read great literature in translation
p26
aVfrom around the world.
p27
aVAnd as great as these books were,
p28
aVyou could always tell
p29
aVthat you were getting close to the full effect.
p30
aVBut not so with Márquez
p31
aVwho once praised his translator's versions
p32
aVas being better than his own,
p33
aVwhich is an astonishing compliment.
p34
aa(lp35
VSo when I heard that the translator, Gregory Rabassa,
p36
aVhad written his own book on the subject,
p37
aVI couldn't wait to read it.
p38
aVIt's called apropos of the Italian adage
p39
aVthat I lifted from his forward,
p40
aV"If This Be Treason."
p41
aVAnd it's a charming read.
p42
aVIt's highly recommended for anyone who's interested
p43
aVin the translator's art.
p44
aVBut the reason that I mention it
p45
aVis that early on, Rabassa offers
p46
aVthis elegantly simple insight:
p47
aV"Every act of communication
p48
aVis an act of translation."
p49
aa(lp50
VNow maybe that's been obvious to all of you for a long time,
p51
aVbut for me,
p52
aVas often as I'd encountered
p53
aVthat exact difficulty on a daily basis,
p54
aVI had never seen the inherent challenge of communication
p55
aVin so crystalline a light.
p56
aVEver since I can remember
p57
aVthinking consciously about such things,
p58
aVcommunication has been my central passion.
p59
aVEven as a child,
p60
aVI remember thinking that what I really wanted most in life
p61
aVwas to be able to understand everything
p62
aVand then to communicate it to everyone else.
p63
aVSo no ego problems.
p64
aVIt's funny, my wife, Daisy,
p65
aVwhose family is littered with schizophrenics \u2014
p66
aVand I mean littered with them \u2014
p67
aVonce said to me, "Chris, I already have a brother who thinks he's God.
p68
aVI don't need a husband who wants to be."
p69
aa(lp70
V(Laughter)
p71
aa(lp72
VAnyway, as I plunged through my 20s
p73
aVever more aware of how unobtainable
p74
aVthe first part of my childhood ambition was,
p75
aVit was that second part,
p76
aVbeing able to successfully communicate to others
p77
aVwhatever knowledge I was gaining,
p78
aVwhere the futility of my quest really set in.
p79
aVTime after time,
p80
aVwhenever I set out to share some great truth
p81
aVwith a soon-to-be grateful recipient,
p82
aVit had the opposite effect.
p83
aVInterestingly, when your opening line of communication is,
p84
aV"Hey, listen up,
p85
aVbecause I'm about to drop some serious knowledge on you,"
p86
aVit's amazing how quickly you'll discover
p87
aVboth ice and the firing squad.
p88
aa(lp89
VFinally, after about 10 years
p90
aVof alienating friends and strangers alike,
p91
aVI finally got it,
p92
aVa new personal truth all my own,
p93
aVthat if I was going to ever communicate well with other people
p94
aVthe ideas that I was gaining,
p95
aVI'd better find a different way of going about it.
p96
aVAnd that's when I discovered comedy.
p97
aa(lp98
VNow comedy travels along a distinct wavelength
p99
aVfrom other forms of language.
p100
aVIf I had to place it on an arbitrary spectrum,
p101
aVI'd say it falls somewhere
p102
aVbetween poetry and lies.
p103
aVAnd I'm not talking about all comedy here,
p104
aVbecause, clearly, there's plenty of humor
p105
aVthat colors safely within the lines of what we already think and feel.
p106
aVWhat I want to talk about
p107
aVis the unique ability that the best comedy and satire has
p108
aVat circumventing our ingrained perspectives \u2014
p109
aVcomedy as the philosopher's stone.
p110
aVIt takes the base metal of our conventional wisdom
p111
aVand transforms it through ridicule
p112
aVinto a different way of seeing
p113
aVand ultimately being in the world.
p114
aVBecause that's what I take
p115
aVfrom the theme of this conference: Gained in Translation.
p116
aVThat it's about communication
p117
aVthat doesn't just produce greater understanding
p118
aVwithin the individual,
p119
aVbut leads to real change.
p120
aVWhich in my experience means communication
p121
aVthat manages to speak to and expand
p122
aVour concept of self-interest.
p123
aVNow I'm big on speaking to people's self-interest
p124
aVbecause we're all wired for that.
p125
aVIt's part of our survival package,
p126
aVand that's why it's become so important for us,
p127
aVand that's why we're always listening at that level.
p128
aVAnd also because that's where,
p129
aVin terms of our own self-interest,
p130
aVwe finally begin to grasp
p131
aVour ability to respond, our responsibility
p132
aVto the rest of the world.
p133
aa(lp134
VNow as to what I mean by the best comedy and satire,
p135
aVI mean work that comes first and foremost
p136
aVfrom a place of honesty and integrity.
p137
aVNow if you think back
p138
aVon Tina Fey's impersonations on Saturday Night Live
p139
aVof the newly nominated vice presidential candidate
p140
aVSarah Palin,
p141
aVthey were devastating.
p142
aVFey demonstrated far more effectively than any political pundit
p143
aVthe candidate's fundamental lack of seriousness,
p144
aVcementing an impression
p145
aVthat the majority of the American public still holds today.
p146
aVAnd the key detail of this
p147
aVis that Fey's scripts weren't written by her
p148
aVand they weren't written by the SNL writers.
p149
aVThey were lifted verbatim
p150
aVfrom Palin's own remarks.
p151
aV(Laughter)
p152
aVHere was a Palin impersonator
p153
aVquoting Palin word for word.
p154
aVNow that's honesty and integrity,
p155
aVand it's also why Fey's performances
p156
aVleft such a lasting impression.
p157
aa(lp158
VOn the other side of the political spectrum,
p159
aVthe first time that I heard Rush Limbaugh
p160
aVrefer to presidential hopeful John Edwards as the Breck girl
p161
aVI knew that he'd made a direct hit.
p162
aVNow it's not often that I'm going to associate
p163
aVthe words honesty and integrity with Limbaugh,
p164
aVbut it's really hard to argue with that punchline.
p165
aVThe description perfectly captured
p166
aVEdwards' personal vanity.
p167
aVAnd guess what?
p168
aVThat ended up being the exact personality trait
p169
aVthat was at the core of the scandal that ended his political career.
p170
aa(lp171
VNow The Daily Show with John Stewart
p172
aVis by far the most \u2014
p173
aV(Applause)
p174
aV(Laughter)
p175
aVit's by far the most well-documented example
p176
aVof the effectiveness of this kind of comedy.
p177
aVSurvey after survey,
p178
aVfrom Pew Research to the Annenberg Center for Public Policy,
p179
aVhas found that Daily Show viewers are better informed about current events
p180
aVthan the viewers of all major network and cable news shows.
p181
aa(lp182
V(Applause)
p183
aa(lp184
VNow whether this says more
p185
aVabout the conflict between integrity and profitability
p186
aVof corporate journalism
p187
aVthan it does about the attentiveness of Stewart's viewers,
p188
aVthe larger point remains
p189
aVthat Stewart's material
p190
aVis always grounded in a commitment to the facts \u2014
p191
aVnot because his intent is to inform. It's not.
p192
aVHis intent is to be funny.
p193
aVIt just so happens that Stewart's brand of funny
p194
aVdoesn't work unless the facts are true.
p195
aVAnd the result is great comedy
p196
aVthat's also an information delivery system
p197
aVthat scores markedly higher in both credibility and retention
p198
aVthan the professional news media.
p199
aVNow this is doubly ironic
p200
aVwhen you consider that what gives comedy its edge
p201
aVat reaching around people's walls
p202
aVis the way that it uses deliberate misdirection.
p203
aa(lp204
VA great piece of comedy is a verbal magic trick,
p205
aVwhere you think it's going over here
p206
aVand then all of a sudden you're transported over here.
p207
aVAnd there's this mental delight
p208
aVthat's followed by the physical response of laughter,
p209
aVwhich, not coincidentally,
p210
aVreleases endorphins in the brain.
p211
aVAnd just like that, you've been seduced
p212
aVinto a different way of looking at something
p213
aVbecause the endorphins have brought down your defenses.
p214
aVThis is the exact opposite
p215
aVof the way that anger and fear and panic,
p216
aVall of the flight-or-fight responses, operate.
p217
aVFlight-or-fight releases adrenalin,
p218
aVwhich throws our walls up sky-high.
p219
aVAnd the comedy comes along,
p220
aVdealing with a lot of the same areas
p221
aVwhere our defenses are the strongest \u2014
p222
aVrace, religion, politics, sexuality \u2014
p223
aVonly by approaching them through humor instead of adrenalin,
p224
aVwe get endorphins
p225
aVand the alchemy of laughter turns our walls into windows,
p226
aVrevealing a fresh and unexpected point of view.
p227
aa(lp228
VNow let me give you an example from my act.
p229
aVI have some material
p230
aVabout the so-called radical gay agenda,
p231
aVwhich starts off by asking,
p232
aVhow radical is the gay agenda?
p233
aVBecause from what I can tell, the three things gay Americans seem to want most
p234
aVare to join the military, get married and start a family.
p235
aV(Laughter)
p236
aVThree things I've tried to avoid my entire life.
p237
aV(Laughter)
p238
aVHave at it you radical bastards. The field is yours.
p239
aa(lp240
V(Laughter)
p241
aa(lp242
VAnd that's followed by these lines
p243
aVabout gay adoption:
p244
aVWhat is the problem with gay adoption?
p245
aVWhy is this remotely controversial?
p246
aVIf you have a baby and you think that baby's gay,
p247
aVyou should be allowed to put it up for adoption.
p248
aV(Laughter)
p249
aVYou have given birth to an abomination.
p250
aVRemove it from your household.
p251
aVNow by taking the biblical epithet "abomination"
p252
aVand attaching it to the ultimate image of innocence, a baby,
p253
aVthis joke short circuits the emotional wiring
p254
aVbehind the debate
p255
aVand it leaves the audience with the opportunity, through their laughter,
p256
aVto question its validity.
p257
aa(lp258
VMisdirection isn't the only trick
p259
aVthat comedy has up its sleeve.
p260
aVEconomy of language
p261
aVis another real strong suit of great comedy.
p262
aVThere are few phrases
p263
aVthat pack a more concentrated dose of subject and symbol
p264
aVthan the perfect punchline.
p265
aVBill Hicks \u2014 and if you don't know his work,
p266
aVyou should really Google him \u2014
p267
aVHicks had a routine
p268
aVabout getting into one of those childhood bragging contests on the playground,
p269
aVwhere finally the other kid says to him,
p270
aV"Huh? Well my dad can beat up your dad,"
p271
aVto which Hicks replies,
p272
aV"Really? How soon?"
p273
aV(Laughter)
p274
aVThat's an entire childhood
p275
aVin three words.
p276
aV(Laughter)
p277
aVNot to mention what it reveals
p278
aVabout the adult who's speaking them.
p279
aa(lp280
VAnd one last powerful attribute
p281
aVthat comedy has as communication
p282
aVis that it's inherently viral.
p283
aVPeople can't wait
p284
aVto pass along that new great joke.
p285
aVAnd this isn't some new phenomenon of our wired world.
p286
aVComedy has been crossing country
p287
aVwith remarkable speed
p288
aVway before the Internet, social media,
p289
aVeven cable TV.
p290
aVBack in 1980
p291
aVwhen comedian Richard Pryor accidentally set himself on fire
p292
aVduring a freebasing accident,
p293
aVI was in Los Angeles the day after it happened
p294
aVand then I was in Washington D.C. two days after that.
p295
aVAnd I heard the exact same punchline on both coasts \u2014
p296
aVsomething about the Ignited Negro College Fund.
p297
aVClearly, it didn't come out of a Tonight Show monologue.
p298
aVAnd my guess here \u2014 and I have no research on this \u2014
p299
aVis that if you really were to look back at it and if you could research it,
p300
aVyou'd find out that comedy
p301
aVis the second oldest viral profession.
p302
aVFirst there were drums
p303
aVand then knock-knock jokes.
p304
aa(lp305
V(Laughter)
p306
aa(lp307
VBut it's when you put all of these elements together \u2014
p308
aVwhen you get the viral appeal of a great joke
p309
aVwith a powerful punchline
p310
aVthat's crafted from honesty and integrity,
p311
aVit can have a real world impact
p312
aVat changing a conversation.
p313
aVNow I have a close friend, Joel Pett,
p314
aVwho's the editorial cartoonist
p315
aVfor the Lexington Herald-Leader.
p316
aVAnd he used to be the USA Today Monday morning guy.
p317
aVI was visiting with Joel
p318
aVthe weekend before the Copenhagen conference on climate change opened
p319
aVin December of 2009.
p320
aVAnd Joel was explaining to me
p321
aVthat, because USA Today
p322
aVwas one of America's four papers of record,
p323
aVit would be scanned by virtually everyone in attendance at the conference,
p324
aVwhich meant that, if he hit it out of the park with his cartoon
p325
aVon Monday, the opening day of the conference,
p326
aVit could get passed around
p327
aVat the highest level among actual decision-makers.
p328
aa(lp329
VSo we started talking about climate change.
p330
aVAnd it turned out that Joel and I
p331
aVwere both bothered by the same thing,
p332
aVwhich was how so much of the debate
p333
aVwas still focused on the science
p334
aVand how complete it was or wasn't,
p335
aVwhich, to both of us,
p336
aVseems somewhat intentionally off point.
p337
aVBecause first of all, there's this false premise
p338
aVthat such a thing as complete science exists.
p339
aVNow Governor Perry of my newly-adopted state of Texas
p340
aVwas pushing this same line this past summer
p341
aVat the beginning of his oops-fated campaign
p342
aVfor the Republican presidential nomination,
p343
aVproclaiming over and over that the science wasn't complete
p344
aVat the same time that 250
p345
aVout of 254 counties in the state of Texas
p346
aVwere on fire.
p347
aVAnd Perry's policy solution
p348
aVwas to ask the people of Texas
p349
aVto pray for rain.
p350
aVPersonally, I was praying for four more fires
p351
aVso we could finally complete the damn science.
p352
aa(lp353
V(Laughter)
p354
aa(lp355
VBut back in 2009,
p356
aVthe question Joel and I kept turning over and over
p357
aVwas why this late in the game
p358
aVso much energy was being spent talking about the science
p359
aVwhen the policies necessary to address climate change
p360
aVwere unequivocally beneficial for humanity in the long run
p361
aVregardless of the science.
p362
aVSo we tossed it back and forth until Joel came up with this.
p363
aVCartoon: "What if it's a big hoax and we create a better world for nothing?"
p364
aV(Laughter)
p365
aVYou've got to love that idea.
p366
aV(Applause)
p367
aVHow about that? How about we create a better world for nothing?
p368
aVNot for God, not for country, not for profit \u2014
p369
aVjust as a basic metric for global decision-making.
p370
aa(lp371
VAnd this cartoon hit the bull's eye.
p372
aVShortly after the conference was over,
p373
aVJoel got a request for a signed copy
p374
aVfrom the head of the EPA in Washington
p375
aVwhose wall it now hangs on.
p376
aVAnd not long after that, he got another request for a copy
p377
aVfrom the head of the EPA in California
p378
aVwho used it as part of her presentation
p379
aVat an international conference on climate change
p380
aVin Sacramento last year.
p381
aVAnd it didn't stop there.
p382
aVTo date, Joel's gotten requests from over 40 environmental groups,
p383
aVin the United States, Canada and Europe.
p384
aVAnd earlier this year,
p385
aVhe got a request from the Green Party in Australia
p386
aVwho used it in their campaign
p387
aVwhere it became part of the debate
p388
aVthat resulted in the Australian parliament
p389
aVadopting the most rigorous carbon tax regime
p390
aVof any country in the world.
p391
aV(Applause)
p392
aVThat is a lot of punch
p393
aVfor 14 words.
p394
aa(lp395
VSo my suggestion to those of you out here
p396
aVwho are seriously focused on creating a better world
p397
aVis to take a little bit of time each day
p398
aVand practice thinking funny,
p399
aVbecause you might just find the question that you've been looking for.
p400
aa(lp401
VThank you.
