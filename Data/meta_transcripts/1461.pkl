VThe great texts of the ancient world
p4
aVdon't survive to us in their original form.
p5
aVThey survive because medieval scribes copied them
p6
aVand copied them and copied them.
p7
aVAnd so it is with Archimedes,
p8
aVthe great Greek mathematician.
p9
aa(lp10
VEverything we know about Archimedes as a mathematician
p11
aVwe know about because of just three books,
p12
aVand they're called A, B and C.
p13
aVAnd A was lost by an Italian humanist in 1564.
p14
aVAnd B was last heard of in the Pope's Library
p15
aVabout a hundred miles north of Rome in Viterbo in 1311.
p16
aVNow Codex C was only discovered in 1906,
p17
aVand it landed on my desk in Baltimore
p18
aVon the 19th of January, 1999.
p19
aVAnd this is Codex C here.
p20
aa(lp21
VNow Codex C is actually buried in this book.
p22
aVIt's buried treasure.
p23
aVBecause this book is actually a prayer book.
p24
aVIt was finished by a guy called Johannes Myrones
p25
aVon the 14th of April, 1229.
p26
aVAnd to make his prayer book he used parchment.
p27
aVBut he didn't use new parchment,
p28
aVhe used parchment recycled from earlier manuscripts,
p29
aVand there were seven of them.
p30
aVAnd Archimedes Codex C was just one of those seven.
p31
aVHe took apart the Archimedes manuscript and the other seven manuscripts.
p32
aVHe erased all of their texts,
p33
aVand then he cut the sheets down in the middle,
p34
aVhe shuffled them up,
p35
aVand he rotated them 90 degrees,
p36
aVand he wrote prayers on top of these books.
p37
aVAnd essentially these seven manuscripts
p38
aVdisappeared for 700 years, and we have a prayer book.
p39
aa(lp40
VThe prayer book was discovered by this guy,
p41
aVJohan Ludvig Heiberg, in 1906.
p42
aVAnd with just a magnifying glass,
p43
aVhe transcribed as much of the text as he could.
p44
aVAnd the thing is that he found two texts in this manuscript
p45
aVthat were unique texts.
p46
aVThey weren't in A and B at all;
p47
aVthey were completely new texts by Archimedes,
p48
aVand they were called "The Method" and "The Stomachion."
p49
aVAnd it became a world famous manuscript.
p50
aa(lp51
VNow it should be clear by now
p52
aVthat this book is in bad condition.
p53
aVIt got in worse condition in the 20th century
p54
aVafter Heiberg saw it.
p55
aVForgeries were painted over it,
p56
aVand it suffered very badly from mold.
p57
aVThis book is the definition of a write-off.
p58
aVIt's the sort of book
p59
aVthat you thought would be in an institution.
p60
aVBut it's not in an institution,
p61
aVit was bought by a private owner in 1998.
p62
aa(lp63
VWhy did he buy this book?
p64
aVBecause he wanted to make that which was fragile safe.
p65
aVHe wanted to make that which was unique ubiquitous.
p66
aVHe wanted to make that which was expensive free.
p67
aVAnd he wanted to do this as a matter of principle.
p68
aVBecause not many people are really going to read Archimedes in ancient Greek,
p69
aVbut they should have the chance to do it.
p70
aa(lp71
VSo he gathered around himself the friends of Archimedes,
p72
aVand he promised to pay for all the work.
p73
aVAnd it was an expensive job,
p74
aVbut actually it wouldn't be as much as you think
p75
aVbecause these people, they didn't come from money,
p76
aVthey came from Archimedes.
p77
aVAnd they came from all sorts of different backgrounds.
p78
aVThey came from particle physics,
p79
aVthey came from classical philology,
p80
aVthey came from book conservation,
p81
aVthey came from ancient mathematics,
p82
aVthey came from data management,
p83
aVthey came from scientific imaging and program management.
p84
aVAnd they got together to work on this manuscript.
p85
aa(lp86
VThe first problem was a conservation problem.
p87
aVAnd this is the sort of thing that we had to deal with:
p88
aVThere was glue on the spine of the book.
p89
aVAnd if you look at this photograph carefully,
p90
aVthe bottom half of this is rather brown.
p91
aVAnd that glue is hide glue.
p92
aVNow if you're a conservator,
p93
aVyou can take off this glue reasonably easily.
p94
aVThe top half is Elmer's wood glue.
p95
aVIt's polyvinyl acetate emulsion
p96
aVthat doesn't dissolve in water once it's dry.
p97
aVAnd it's much tougher than the parchment that it was written on.
p98
aVAnd so before we could start imaging Archimedes,
p99
aVwe had to take this book apart.
p100
aVSo it took four years to take apart.
p101
aVAnd this is a rare action shot, ladies and gentlemen.
p102
aa(lp103
V(Laughter)
p104
aa(lp105
VAnother thing is that we had to get rid of all the wax,
p106
aVbecause this was used in the liturgical services
p107
aVof the Greek Orthodox Church
p108
aVand they'd used candle wax.
p109
aVAnd the candle wax was dirty,
p110
aVand we couldn't image through the wax.
p111
aVSo very carefully we had to mechanically scrape off all the wax.
p112
aa(lp113
VIt's hard to tell you exactly
p114
aVhow bad this condition of this book is,
p115
aVbut it came out in little bits very often.
p116
aVAnd normally in a book, you wouldn't worry about the little bits,
p117
aVbut these little bits might contain unique Archimedes text.
p118
aVSo, tiny fragments
p119
aVwe actually managed to put back in the right place.
p120
aa(lp121
VThen, having done that, we started to image the manuscript.
p122
aVAnd we imaged the manuscript
p123
aVin 14 different wavebands of light.
p124
aVBecause if you look at something in different wavebands of light,
p125
aVyou see different things.
p126
aVAnd here is an image of a page
p127
aVimaged in 14 different wavebands of light.
p128
aa(lp129
VBut none of them worked.
p130
aVSo what we did was we processed the images together,
p131
aVand we put two images into one blank screen.
p132
aVAnd here are two different images of the Archimedes manuscript.
p133
aVAnd the image on the left
p134
aVis the normal red image.
p135
aVAnd the image on the right is an ultraviolet image.
p136
aVAnd in the image on the right
p137
aVyou might be able to see some of the Archimedes writing.
p138
aVIf you merge them together into one digital canvas,
p139
aVthe parchment is bright in both images
p140
aVand it comes out bright.
p141
aVThe prayer book is dark in both images
p142
aVand it comes out dark.
p143
aVThe Archimedes text is dark in one image and bright in another.
p144
aVAnd it'll come out dark but red,
p145
aVand then you can start to read it rather clearly.
p146
aVAnd that's what it looks like.
p147
aa(lp148
VNow that's a before and after image,
p149
aVbut you don't read the image on the screen like that.
p150
aVYou zoom in and you zoom in
p151
aVand you zoom in and you zoom in,
p152
aVand you can just read it now.
p153
aa(lp154
V(Applause)
p155
aa(lp156
VIf you process the same two images in a different way,
p157
aVyou can actually get rid of the prayer book text.
p158
aVAnd this is terribly important,
p159
aVbecause the diagrams in the manuscript
p160
aVare the unique source for the diagrams
p161
aVthat Archimedes drew in the sand in the fourth century B.C.
p162
aVAnd there we are, I can give them to you.
p163
aa(lp164
VWith this kind of imaging \u2014
p165
aVthis kind of infrared, ultraviolet, invisible light imaging \u2014
p166
aVwe were never going to image through the gold ground forgeries.
p167
aVHow were we going to do that?
p168
aVWell we took the manuscript,
p169
aVand we decided to image it in X-ray fluorescence imaging.
p170
aVSo an X-ray comes in in the diagram on the left
p171
aVand it knocks out an electron from the inner shell of an atom.
p172
aVAnd that electron disappears.
p173
aVAnd as it disappears, an electron from a shell farther out
p174
aVjumps in and takes its place.
p175
aVAnd when it takes its place,
p176
aVit sheds electromagnetic radiation.
p177
aVIt sheds an X-ray.
p178
aVAnd this X-ray is specific in its wavelength
p179
aVto the atom that it hits.
p180
aa(lp181
VAnd what we wanted to get
p182
aVwas the iron.
p183
aVBecause the ink was written in iron.
p184
aVAnd if we can map
p185
aVwhere this X-ray that comes out, where it comes from,
p186
aVwe can map all the iron on the page,
p187
aVthen theoretically we can read the image.
p188
aa(lp189
VThe thing is that you need a very powerful light source to do this.
p190
aVSo we took it to the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory
p191
aVin California,
p192
aVwhich is a particle accelerator.
p193
aVElectrons go around one way,
p194
aVpositrons go around the other.
p195
aVThey meet in the middle,
p196
aVand they create subatomic particles
p197
aVlike the charm quark and the tau lepton.
p198
aVNow we weren't actually going to put Archimedes in that beam.
p199
aVBut as the electrons go round at the speed of light,
p200
aVthey shed X-rays.
p201
aVAnd this is the most powerful light source in the solar system.
p202
aVThis is called synchrotron radiation,
p203
aVand it's normally used to look at things
p204
aVlike proteins and that sort of thing.
p205
aVBut we wanted it to look at atoms, at iron atoms,
p206
aVso that we could read the page from before and after.
p207
aVAnd lo and behold, we found that we could do it.
p208
aVIt took about 17 minutes to do a single page.
p209
aa(lp210
VSo what did we discover?
p211
aVWell one of the unique texts in Archimedes
p212
aVis called "The Stomachion."
p213
aVAnd this didn't exist in Codices A and B.
p214
aVAnd we knew that it involved this square.
p215
aVAnd this is a perfect square,
p216
aVand it's divided into 14 bits.
p217
aVBut no one knew what Archimedes was doing with these 14 bits.
p218
aVAnd now we think we know.
p219
aVHe was trying to work out
p220
aVhow many ways you can recombine those 14 bits
p221
aVand still make a perfect square.
p222
aVAnyone want to guess the answer?
p223
aVIt's 17,152 divided into 536 families.
p224
aVAnd the important point about this
p225
aVis that it's the earliest study in combinatorics in mathematics.
p226
aVAnd combinatorics is a wonderful and interesting branch of mathematics.
p227
aa(lp228
VThe really astonishing thing though about this manuscript
p229
aVis that we looked at the other manuscripts
p230
aVthat the palimpsester had made,
p231
aVthe scribe had made his book out of,
p232
aVand one of them was a manuscript containing text by Hyperides.
p233
aVNow Hyperides was an Athenian orator from the fourth century B.C.
p234
aVHe was an exact contemporary of Demosthenes.
p235
aVAnd in 338 B.C. he and Demosthenes together
p236
aVdecided that they wanted to stand up
p237
aVto the military might of Philip of Macedon.
p238
aVSo Athens and Thebes went out to fight Philip of Macedon.
p239
aVThis was a bad idea,
p240
aVbecause Philip of Macedon had a son called Alexander the Great,
p241
aVand they lost the battle of Chaeronea.
p242
aa(lp243
VAlexander the Great went on to conquer the known world;
p244
aVHyperides found himself on trial for treason.
p245
aVAnd this is the speech that he gave when he was on trial \u2014
p246
aVand it's a great speech:
p247
aV"Best of all," he says, "is to win.
p248
aVBut if you can't win,
p249
aVthen you should fight for a noble cause,
p250
aVbecause then you'll be remembered.
p251
aVConsider the Spartans.
p252
aVThey won enumerable victories,
p253
aVbut no one remembers what they are
p254
aVbecause they were all fought for selfish ends.
p255
aVThe one battle that the Spartans fought that everybody remembers
p256
aVis the the battle of Thermopylae
p257
aVwhere they were butchered to a man,
p258
aVbut fought for the freedom of Greece."
p259
aVIt was such a great speech
p260
aVthat the Athenian law courts let him off.
p261
aVHe lived for another 10 years,
p262
aVthen the Macedonian faction caught up with him.
p263
aVThey cut out his tongue in mockery of his oratory,
p264
aVand no one knows what they did with his body.
p265
aVSo this is the discovery of a lost voice from antiquity,
p266
aVspeaking to us, not from the grave,
p267
aVbecause his grave doesn't exist,
p268
aVbut from the Athenian law courts.
p269
aa(lp270
VNow I should say at this point
p271
aVthat normally when you're looking
p272
aVat medieval manuscripts that have been scraped off,
p273
aVyou don't find unique texts.
p274
aVAnd to find two in one manuscript is really something.
p275
aVTo find three is completely weird.
p276
aVAnd we found three.
p277
aa(lp278
VAristotle's "Categories"
p279
aVis one of the foundational texts of Western philosophy.
p280
aVAnd we found a third century A.D. commentary on it,
p281
aVpossibly by Galen and probably by Porphyry.
p282
aa(lp283
VNow all this data that we collected,
p284
aVall the images, all the raw images,
p285
aVall the transcriptions that we made and that sort of thing
p286
aVhave been put online under a Creative Commons license
p287
aVfor anyone to use for any commercial purpose.
p288
aa(lp289
V(Applause)
p290
aa(lp291
VWhy did the owner of the manuscript do this?
p292
aVHe did this because he understands data as well as books.
p293
aVNow the thing to do with books,
p294
aVif you want to ensure their long-term utility,
p295
aVis to hide them away in closets
p296
aVand let very few people look at them.
p297
aVThe thing to do with data, if you want it to survive,
p298
aVis to let it out and have everybody have it
p299
aVwith as little control on that data as possible.
p300
aVAnd that's what he did.
p301
aa(lp302
VAnd institutions can learn from this.
p303
aVBecause institutions at the moment
p304
aVconfine their data with copyright restrictions and that sort of thing.
p305
aVAnd if you want to look at medieval manuscripts on the Web,
p306
aVat the moment you have to go to the National Library of Y's site
p307
aVor the University Library of X's site,
p308
aVwhich is about the most boring way
p309
aVin which you can deal with digital data.
p310
aVWhat you want to do is to aggregate it all together.
p311
aa(lp312
VBecause the Web of the ancient manuscripts of the future
p313
aVisn't going to be built by institutions.
p314
aVIt's going to be built by users,
p315
aVby people who get this data together,
p316
aVby people who want to aggregate all sorts of maps
p317
aVfrom wherever they come from,
p318
aVall sorts of medieval romances
p319
aVfrom wherever they come from,
p320
aVpeople who just want to curate their own glorious selection
p321
aVof beautiful things.
p322
aVAnd that is the future of the Web.
p323
aVAnd it's an attractive and beautiful future,
p324
aVif only we can make it happen.
p325
aa(lp326
VNow we at the Walters Art Museum have followed this example,
p327
aVand we have put up all our manuscripts on the Web
p328
aVfor people to enjoy \u2014
p329
aVall the raw data, all the descriptions, all the metadata.
p330
aVunder a Creative Commons license.
p331
aVNow the Walters Art Museum is a small museum
p332
aVand it has beautiful manuscripts,
p333
aVbut the data is fantastic.
p334
aVAnd the result of this
p335
aVis that if you do a Google search on images right now
p336
aVand you type in "Illuminated manuscript Koran" for example,
p337
aV24 of the 28 images you'll find come from my institution.
p338
aa(lp339
V(Applause)
p340
aa(lp341
VNow, let's think about this for a minute.
p342
aVWhat's in it for the institution?
p343
aVThere are all sorts of things that are in it for the institution.
p344
aVYou can talk about the Humanities and that sort of thing,
p345
aVbut let's talk about selfish things.
p346
aVBecause what's really in it for the institution is this:
p347
aVNow why do people go to the Louvre?
p348
aVThey go to see the Mona Lisa.
p349
aVWhy do they go to see the Mona Lisa?
p350
aVBecause they already know what she looks like.
p351
aVAnd they know what she looks like
p352
aVbecause they've seen pictures of her absolutely everywhere.
p353
aa(lp354
VNow, there is no need
p355
aVfor these restrictions at all.
p356
aVAnd I think that institutions should stand up
p357
aVand release all their data under unrestricted licenses,
p358
aVand it would be a great benefit to everybody.
p359
aVWhy don't we just let everybody have access to this data
p360
aVand curate their own collection
p361
aVof ancient knowledge and wonderful and beautiful things
p362
aVand increase the beauty and the cultural significance
p363
aVof the Internet.
