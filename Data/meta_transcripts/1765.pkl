VThis will not be a speech
p4
aVlike any one I have ever given.
p5
aVI will talk to you today about
p6
aVthe failure of leadership in global politics
p7
aVand in our globalizing economy.
p8
aVAnd I won't provide some feel-good, ready-made solutions.
p9
aVBut I will in the end urge you
p10
aVto rethink, actually take risks, and get involved
p11
aVin what I see as a global evolution
p12
aVof democracy.
p13
aa(lp14
VFailure of leadership.
p15
aVWhat is the failure of leadership today?
p16
aVAnd why is our democracy not working?
p17
aVWell, I believe that the failure of leadership is the fact
p18
aVthat we have taken you out of the process.
p19
aVSo let me, from my personal experiences,
p20
aVgive you an insight, so that you can step back
p21
aVand maybe understand why it is so difficult to cope
p22
aVwith the challenges of today and why politics
p23
aVis going down a blind alley.
p24
aa(lp25
VLet's start from the beginning.
p26
aVLet's start from democracy.
p27
aVWell, if you go back to the Ancient Greeks,
p28
aVit was a revelation, a discovery,
p29
aVthat we had the potential, together,
p30
aVto be masters of our own fate,
p31
aVto be able to examine, to learn, to imagine,
p32
aVand then to design a better life.
p33
aVAnd democracy was the political innovation
p34
aVwhich protected this freedom,
p35
aVbecause we were liberated from fear
p36
aVso that our minds in fact,
p37
aVwhether they be despots or dogmas,
p38
aVcould be the protagonists.
p39
aVDemocracy was the political innovation that allowed us
p40
aVto limit the power, whether it was of tyrants
p41
aVor of high priests,
p42
aVtheir natural tendency to maximize power and wealth.
p43
aa(lp44
VWell, I first began to understand this
p45
aVwhen I was 14 years old.
p46
aVI used to, to try to avoid homework,
p47
aVsneak down to the living room and listen to my parents
p48
aVand their friends debate heatedly.
p49
aVYou see, then Greece was
p50
aVunder control of a very powerful establishment
p51
aVwhich was strangling the country,
p52
aVand my father was heading a promising movement
p53
aVto reimagine Greece, to imagine a Greece
p54
aVwhere freedom reigned and where, maybe,
p55
aVthe people, the citizens, could actually rule their own country.
p56
aa(lp57
VI used to join him in many of the campaigns,
p58
aVand you can see me here next to him.
p59
aVI'm the younger one there, to the side.
p60
aVYou may not recognize me because
p61
aVI used to part my hair differently there.
p62
aa(lp63
V(Laughter)
p64
aa(lp65
VSo in 1967, elections were coming,
p66
aVthings were going well in the campaign,
p67
aVthe house was electric.
p68
aVWe really could sense that there was going to be
p69
aVa major progressive change in Greece.
p70
aa(lp71
VThen one night, military trucks drive up to our house.
p72
aVSoldiers storm the door.
p73
aVThey find me up on the top terrace.
p74
aVA sergeant comes up to me with a machine gun,
p75
aVputs it to my head, and says,
p76
aV"Tell me where your father is or I will kill you."
p77
aVMy father, hiding nearby, reveals himself,
p78
aVand was summarily taken to prison.
p79
aa(lp80
VWell, we survived, but democracy did not.
p81
aVSeven brutal years of dictatorship
p82
aVwhich we spent in exile.
p83
aa(lp84
VNow, today, our democracies are again
p85
aVfacing a moment of truth.
p86
aVLet me tell you a story.
p87
aVSunday evening,
p88
aVBrussels, April 2010.
p89
aVI'm sitting with my counterparts in the European Union.
p90
aVI had just been elected prime minister,
p91
aVbut I had the unhappy privilege of revealing a truth
p92
aVthat our deficit was not 6 percent,
p93
aVas had been officially reported only a few days earlier
p94
aVbefore the elections by the previous government,
p95
aVbut actually 15.6 percent.
p96
aVBut the deficit was only the symptom
p97
aVof much deeper problems that Greece was facing,
p98
aVand I had been elected on a mandate, a mission, actually,
p99
aVto tackle these problems,
p100
aVwhether it was lack of transparency
p101
aVand accountability in governance,
p102
aVor whether it was a clientelistic state
p103
aVoffering favors to the powerful \u2014 tax avoidance
p104
aVabetted and aided by a global tax evasion system,
p105
aVpolitics and media captured by special interests.
p106
aVBut despite our electoral mandate,
p107
aVthe markets mistrusted us.
p108
aVOur borrowing costs were skyrocketing,
p109
aVand we were facing possible default.
p110
aa(lp111
VSo I went to Brussels on a mission
p112
aVto make the case for a united European response,
p113
aVone that would calm the markets and give us the time
p114
aVto make the necessary reforms.
p115
aVBut time we didn't get.
p116
aVPicture yourselves around the table in Brussels.
p117
aVNegotiations are difficult, the tensions are high,
p118
aVprogress is slow, and then, 10 minutes to 2,
p119
aVa prime minister shouts out,
p120
aV"We have to finish in 10 minutes."
p121
aa(lp122
VI said, "Why? These are important decisions.
p123
aVLet's deliberate a little bit longer."
p124
aa(lp125
VAnother prime minister comes in and says,
p126
aV"No, we have to have an agreement now,
p127
aVbecause in 10 minutes,
p128
aVthe markets are opening up in Japan,
p129
aVand there will be havoc in the global economy."
p130
aa(lp131
VWe quickly came to a decision in those 10 minutes.
p132
aVThis time it was not the military,
p133
aVbut the markets, that put a gun to our collective heads.
p134
aVWhat followed were the most difficult decisions in my life,
p135
aVpainful to me, painful to my countrymen,
p136
aVimposing cuts, austerity,
p137
aVoften on those not to blame for the crisis.
p138
aVWith these sacrifices, Greece did avoid bankruptcy
p139
aVand the eurozone avoided a collapse.
p140
aa(lp141
VGreece, yes, triggered the Euro crisis,
p142
aVand some people blame me for pulling the trigger.
p143
aVBut I think today that most would agree
p144
aVthat Greece was only a symptom
p145
aVof much deeper structural problems in the eurozone,
p146
aVvulnerabilities in the wider global economic system,
p147
aVvulnerabilities of our democracies.
p148
aVOur democracies are trapped by systems too big to fail,
p149
aVor, more accurately, too big to control.
p150
aVOur democracies are weakened in the global economy
p151
aVwith players that can evade laws, evade taxes,
p152
aVevade environmental or labor standards.
p153
aVOur democracies are undermined
p154
aVby the growing inequality
p155
aVand the growing concentration of power and wealth,
p156
aVlobbies, corruption, the speed of the markets
p157
aVor simply the fact that we sometimes fear an impending disaster,
p158
aVhave constrained our democracies,
p159
aVand they have constrained our capacity
p160
aVto imagine and actually use the potential, your potential,
p161
aVin finding solutions.
p162
aa(lp163
VGreece, you see, was only a preview
p164
aVof what is in store for us all.
p165
aVI, overly optimistically, had hoped
p166
aVthat this crisis was an opportunity for Greece, for Europe,
p167
aVfor the world, to make radical democratic transformations
p168
aVin our institutions.
p169
aVInstead, I had a very humbling experience.
p170
aVIn Brussels, when we tried desperately again and again
p171
aVto find common solutions,
p172
aVI realized that not one, not one of us,
p173
aVhad ever dealt with a similar crisis.
p174
aVBut worse, we were trapped by our collective ignorance.
p175
aVWe were led by our fears.
p176
aVAnd our fears led to a blind faith
p177
aVin the orthodoxy of austerity.
p178
aVInstead of reaching out to the common
p179
aVor the collective wisdom in our societies,
p180
aVinvesting in it to find more creative solutions,
p181
aVwe reverted to political posturing.
p182
aVAnd then we were surprised when every
p183
aVad hoc new measure didn't bring an end to the crisis,
p184
aVand of course that made it very easy
p185
aVto look for a whipping boy
p186
aVfor our collective European failure,
p187
aVand of course that was Greece.
p188
aVThose profligate, idle, ouzo-swilling, Zorba-dancing Greeks,
p189
aVthey are the problem. Punish them!
p190
aVWell, a convenient but unfounded stereotype
p191
aVthat sometimes hurt even more than austerity itself.
p192
aa(lp193
VBut let me warn you, this is not just about Greece.
p194
aVThis could be the pattern
p195
aVthat leaders follow again and again
p196
aVwhen we deal with these complex, cross-border problems,
p197
aVwhether it's climate change, whether it's migration,
p198
aVwhether it's the financial system.
p199
aVThat is, abandoning our collective power
p200
aVto imagine our potential,
p201
aVfalling victims to our fears, our stereotypes, our dogmas,
p202
aVtaking our citizens out of the process
p203
aVrather than building the process around our citizens.
p204
aVAnd doing so will only test the faith
p205
aVof our citizens, of our peoples, even more
p206
aVin the democratic process.
p207
aa(lp208
VIt's no wonder that many political leaders,
p209
aVand I don't exclude myself,
p210
aVhave lost the trust of our people.
p211
aVWhen riot police have to protect parliaments,
p212
aVa scene which is increasingly common around the world,
p213
aVthen there's something deeply wrong with our democracies.
p214
aVThat's why I called for a referendum to have the Greek people
p215
aVown and decide on the terms of the rescue package.
p216
aVMy European counterparts, some of them, at least,
p217
aVsaid, "You can't do this.
p218
aVThere will be havoc in the markets again."
p219
aVI said, "We need to, before we restore confidence in the markets,
p220
aVwe need to restore confidence and trust amongst our people."
p221
aa(lp222
VSince leaving office, I have had time to reflect.
p223
aVWe have weathered the storm, in Greece and in Europe,
p224
aVbut we remain challenged.
p225
aVIf politics is the power to imagine and use our potential,
p226
aVwell then 60-percent youth unemployment in Greece,
p227
aVand in other countries, certainly is a lack of imagination
p228
aVif not a lack of compassion.
p229
aVSo far, we've thrown economics at the problem,
p230
aVactually mostly austerity,
p231
aVand certainly we could have designed alternatives,
p232
aVa different strategy, a green stimulus for green jobs,
p233
aVor mutualized debt, Eurobonds which would
p234
aVsupport countries in need from market pressures,
p235
aVthese would have been much more viable alternatives.
p236
aVYet I have come to believe that the problem is not so much
p237
aVone of economics as it is one of democracy.
p238
aa(lp239
VSo let's try something else.
p240
aVLet's see how we can bring people back to the process.
p241
aVLet's throw democracy at the problem.
p242
aVAgain, the Ancient Greeks, with all their shortcomings,
p243
aVbelieved in the wisdom of the crowd
p244
aVat their best moments. In people we trust.
p245
aVDemocracy could not work without the citizens
p246
aVdeliberating, debating, taking on public responsibilities
p247
aVfor public affairs.
p248
aVAverage citizens often were chosen for citizen juries
p249
aVto decide on critical matters of the day.
p250
aVScience, theater, research, philosophy,
p251
aVgames of the mind and the body,
p252
aVthey were daily exercises.
p253
aVActually they were an education for participation,
p254
aVfor the potential, for growing the potential of our citizens.
p255
aa(lp256
VAnd those who shunned politics, well, they were idiots.
p257
aVYou see, in Ancient Greece, in ancient Athens,
p258
aVthat term originated there.
p259
aV"Idiot" comes from the root "idio," oneself.
p260
aVA person who is self-centered, secluded, excluded,
p261
aVsomeone who doesn't participate or even examine public affairs.
p262
aVAnd participation took place in the agora, the agora having two meanings,
p263
aVboth a marketplace and a place where there was political deliberation.
p264
aVYou see, markets and politics then were one, unified,
p265
aVaccessible, transparent, because they gave power to the people.
p266
aVThey serve the demos, democracy.
p267
aVAbove government, above markets
p268
aVwas the direct rule of the people.
p269
aa(lp270
VToday we have globalized the markets
p271
aVbut we have not globalized our democratic institutions.
p272
aVSo our politicians are limited to local politics,
p273
aVwhile our citizens, even though they see a great potential,
p274
aVare prey to forces beyond their control.
p275
aa(lp276
VSo how then do we reunite the two halves of the agora?
p277
aVHow do we democratize globalization?
p278
aVAnd I'm not talking about the necessary reforms
p279
aVof the United Nations or the G20.
p280
aVI'm talking about, how do we secure the space,
p281
aVthe demos, the platform of values,
p282
aVso that we can tap into all of your potential?
p283
aa(lp284
VWell, this is exactly where I think Europe fits in.
p285
aVEurope, despite its recent failures,
p286
aVis the world's most successful cross-border peace experiment.
p287
aVSo let's see if it can't be an experiment
p288
aVin global democracy, a new kind of democracy.
p289
aVLet's see if we can't design a European agora,
p290
aVnot simply for products and services,
p291
aVbut for our citizens, where they can work together,
p292
aVdeliberate, learn from each other,
p293
aVexchange between art and cultures,
p294
aVwhere they can come up with creative solutions.
p295
aVLet's imagine that European citizens
p296
aVactually have the power to vote directly
p297
aVfor a European president,
p298
aVor citizen juries chosen by lottery
p299
aVwhich can deliberate on critical and controversial issues,
p300
aVa European-wide referendum where our citizens,
p301
aVas the lawmakers, vote on future treaties.
p302
aVAnd here's an idea:
p303
aVWhy not have the first truly European citizens
p304
aVby giving our immigrants,
p305
aVnot Greek or German or Swedish citizenship,
p306
aVbut a European citizenship?
p307
aVAnd make sure we actually empower
p308
aVthe unemployed by giving them a voucher scholarship
p309
aVwhere they can choose to study anywhere in Europe.
p310
aVWhere our common identity is democracy,
p311
aVwhere our education is through participation,
p312
aVand where participation builds trust
p313
aVand solidarity rather than exclusion and xenophobia.
p314
aVEurope of and by the people,
p315
aVa Europe, an experiment in deepening and widening
p316
aVdemocracy beyond borders.
p317
aa(lp318
VNow, some might accuse me of being naive,
p319
aVputting my faith in the power and the wisdom of the people.
p320
aVWell, after decades in politics, I am also a pragmatist.
p321
aVBelieve me, I have been,
p322
aVI am, part of today's political system,
p323
aVand I know things must change.
p324
aVWe must revive politics as the power to imagine,
p325
aVreimagine, and redesign for a better world.
p326
aa(lp327
VBut I also know that this disruptive force of change
p328
aVwon't be driven by the politics of today.
p329
aVThe revival of democratic politics
p330
aVwill come from you, and I mean all of you.
p331
aVEveryone who participates in this global exchange of ideas,
p332
aVwhether it's here in this room
p333
aVor just outside this room
p334
aVor online or locally, where everybody lives,
p335
aVeveryone who stands up to injustice and inequality,
p336
aVeverybody who stands up to those who preach
p337
aVracism rather than empathy,
p338
aVdogma rather than critical thinking,
p339
aVtechnocracy rather than democracy,
p340
aVeveryone who stands up to the unchecked power,
p341
aVwhether it's authoritarian leaders,
p342
aVplutocrats hiding their assets in tax havens,
p343
aVor powerful lobbies protecting the powerful few.
p344
aa(lp345
VIt is in their interest that all of us are idiots.
p346
aVLet's not be.
p347
aa(lp348
VThank you.
p349
aa(lp350
V(Applause)
p351
aa(lp352
VBruno Giussani: You seem to describe a political leadership
p353
aVthat is kind of unprepared
p354
aVand a prisoner of the whims of the financial markets,
p355
aVand that scene in Brussels that you describe, to me,
p356
aVas a citizen, is terrifying.
p357
aVHelp us understand how you felt after the decision.
p358
aVIt was not a good decision, clearly,
p359
aVbut how do you feel after that, not as the prime minister,
p360
aVbut as George?
p361
aa(lp362
VGeorge Papandreou: Well, obviously there were constraints
p363
aVwhich didn't allow me or others to make
p364
aVthe types of decisions we would have wanted,
p365
aVand obviously I had hoped that we would have the time
p366
aVto make the reforms which would have dealt
p367
aVwith the deficit rather than trying to cut the deficit
p368
aVwhich was the symptom of the problem.
p369
aVAnd that hurt. That hurt because that, first of all,
p370
aVhurt the younger generation, and not only,
p371
aVmany of them are demonstrating outside,
p372
aVbut I think this is one of our problems.
p373
aVWhen we face these crises, we have kept the potential,
p374
aVthe huge potential of our society out of this process,
p375
aVand we are closing in on ourselves in politics,
p376
aVand I think we need to change that, to really find
p377
aVnew participatory ways using the great capabilities
p378
aVthat now exist even in technology but not only in technology,
p379
aVthe minds that we have, and I think we can find solutions
p380
aVwhich are much better, but we have to be open.
p381
aa(lp382
VBG: You seem to suggest that the way forward
p383
aVis more Europe, and that is not to be an easy discourse
p384
aVright now in most European countries.
p385
aVIt's rather the other way \u2014 more closed borders
p386
aVand less cooperation and maybe even stepping out
p387
aVof some of the different parts of the European construction.
p388
aVHow do you reconcile that?
p389
aa(lp390
VGP: Well, I think one of the worst things that happened
p391
aVduring this crisis is that we started a blame game.
p392
aVAnd the fundamental idea of Europe is that
p393
aVwe can cooperate beyond borders,
p394
aVgo beyond our conflicts and work together.
p395
aVAnd the paradox is that, because we have this blame game,
p396
aVwe have less the potential to convince our citizens
p397
aVthat we should work together,
p398
aVwhile now is the time when we really need
p399
aVto bring our powers together.
p400
aa(lp401
VNow, more Europe for me is not simply
p402
aVgiving more power to Brussels.
p403
aVIt is actually giving more power to the citizens of Europe,
p404
aVthat is, really making Europe a project of the people.
p405
aVSo that, I think, would be a way to answer
p406
aVsome of the fears that we have in our society.
p407
aa(lp408
VBG: George, thank you for coming to TED.
p409
aa(lp410
