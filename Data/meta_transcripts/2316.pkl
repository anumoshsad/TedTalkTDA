VI'd like to introduce you to an emerging area of science,
p4
aVone that is still speculative but hugely exciting,
p5
aVand certainly one that's growing very rapidly.
p6
aVQuantum biology asks a very simple question:
p7
aVDoes quantum mechanics \u2014
p8
aVthat weird and wonderful and powerful theory
p9
aVof the subatomic world of atoms and molecules
p10
aVthat underpins so much of modern physics and chemistry \u2014
p11
aValso play a role inside the living cell?
p12
aVIn other words: Are there processes, mechanisms, phenomena
p13
aVin living organisms that can only be explained
p14
aVwith a helping hand from quantum mechanics?
p15
aVNow, quantum biology isn't new;
p16
aVit's been around since the early 1930s.
p17
aVBut it's only in the last decade or so that careful experiments \u2014
p18
aVin biochemistry labs, using spectroscopy \u2014
p19
aVhave shown very clear, firm evidence that there are certain specific mechanisms
p20
aVthat require quantum mechanics to explain them.
p21
aa(lp22
VQuantum biology brings together quantum physicists, biochemists,
p23
aVmolecular biologists \u2014 it's a very interdisciplinary field.
p24
aVI come from quantum physics, so I'm a nuclear physicist.
p25
aa(lp26
VI've spent more than three decades
p27
aVtrying to get my head around quantum mechanics.
p28
aVOne of the founders of quantum mechanics, Niels Bohr,
p29
aVsaid, If you're not astonished by it, then you haven't understood it.
p30
aVSo I sort of feel happy that I'm still astonished by it.
p31
aVThat's a good thing.
p32
aVBut it means I study the very smallest structures in the universe \u2014
p33
aVthe building blocks of reality.
p34
aVIf we think about the scale of size,
p35
aVstart with an everyday object like the tennis ball,
p36
aVand just go down orders of magnitude in size \u2014
p37
aVfrom the eye of a needle down to a cell, down to a bacterium, down to an enzyme \u2014
p38
aVyou eventually reach the nano-world.
p39
aa(lp40
VNow, nanotechnology may be a term you've heard of.
p41
aVA nanometer is a billionth of a meter.
p42
aVMy area is the atomic nucleus, which is the tiny dot inside an atom.
p43
aVIt's even smaller in scale.
p44
aVThis is the domain of quantum mechanics,
p45
aVand physicists and chemists have had a long time
p46
aVto try and get used to it.
p47
aVBiologists, on the other hand, have got off lightly, in my view.
p48
aVThey are very happy with their balls-and-sticks models of molecules.
p49
aa(lp50
V(Laughter)
p51
aa(lp52
VThe balls are the atoms, the sticks are the bonds between the atoms.
p53
aVAnd when they can't build them physically in the lab,
p54
aVnowadays, they have very powerful computers
p55
aVthat will simulate a huge molecule.
p56
aVThis is a protein made up of 100,000 atoms.
p57
aVIt doesn't really require much in the way of quantum mechanics to explain it.
p58
aVQuantum mechanics was developed in the 1920s.
p59
aVIt is a set of beautiful and powerful mathematical rules and ideas
p60
aVthat explain the world of the very small.
p61
aVAnd it's a world that's very different from our everyday world,
p62
aVmade up of trillions of atoms.
p63
aVIt's a world built on probability and chance.
p64
aVIt's a fuzzy world.
p65
aVIt's a world of phantoms,
p66
aVwhere particles can also behave like spread-out waves.
p67
aa(lp68
VIf we imagine quantum mechanics or quantum physics, then,
p69
aVas the fundamental foundation of reality itself,
p70
aVthen it's not surprising that we say
p71
aVquantum physics underpins organic chemistry.
p72
aVAfter all, it gives us the rules that tell us
p73
aVhow the atoms fit together to make organic molecules.
p74
aVOrganic chemistry, scaled up in complexity,
p75
aVgives us molecular biology, which of course leads to life itself.
p76
aVSo in a way, it's sort of not surprising.
p77
aVIt's almost trivial.
p78
aVYou say, "Well, of course life ultimately must depend of quantum mechanics."
p79
aVBut so does everything else.
p80
aVSo does all inanimate matter, made up of trillions of atoms.
p81
aa(lp82
VUltimately, there's a quantum level
p83
aVwhere we have to delve into this weirdness.
p84
aVBut in everyday life, we can forget about it.
p85
aVBecause once you put together trillions of atoms,
p86
aVthat quantum weirdness just dissolves away.
p87
aVQuantum biology isn't about this.
p88
aVQuantum biology isn't this obvious.
p89
aVOf course quantum mechanics underpins life at some molecular level.
p90
aVQuantum biology is about looking for the non-trivial \u2014
p91
aVthe counterintuitive ideas in quantum mechanics \u2014
p92
aVand to see if they do, indeed, play an important role
p93
aVin describing the processes of life.
p94
aa(lp95
VHere is my perfect example of the counterintuitiveness
p96
aVof the quantum world.
p97
aVThis is the quantum skier.
p98
aVHe seems to be intact, he seems to be perfectly healthy,
p99
aVand yet, he seems to have gone around both sides of that tree at the same time.
p100
aVWell, if you saw tracks like that
p101
aVyou'd guess it was some sort of stunt, of course.
p102
aVBut in the quantum world, this happens all the time.
p103
aVParticles can multitask, they can be in two places at once.
p104
aVThey can do more than one thing at the same time.
p105
aVParticles can behave like spread-out waves.
p106
aVIt's almost like magic.
p107
aa(lp108
VPhysicists and chemists have had nearly a century
p109
aVof trying to get used to this weirdness.
p110
aVI don't blame the biologists
p111
aVfor not having to or wanting to learn quantum mechanics.
p112
aa(lp113
VYou see, this weirdness is very delicate;
p114
aVand we physicists work very hard to maintain it in our labs.
p115
aVWe cool our system down to near absolute zero,
p116
aVwe carry out our experiments in vacuums,
p117
aVwe try and isolate it from any external disturbance.
p118
aVThat's very different from the warm, messy, noisy environment of a living cell.
p119
aVBiology itself, if you think of molecular biology,
p120
aVseems to have done very well in describing all the processes of life
p121
aVin terms of chemistry \u2014 chemical reactions.
p122
aVAnd these are reductionist, deterministic chemical reactions,
p123
aVshowing that, essentially, life is made of the same stuff as everything else,
p124
aVand if we can forget about quantum mechanics in the macro world,
p125
aVthen we should be able to forget about it in biology, as well.
p126
aa(lp127
VWell, one man begged to differ with this idea.
p128
aVErwin Schrödinger, of Schrödinger's Cat fame,
p129
aVwas an Austrian physicist.
p130
aVHe was one of the founders of quantum mechanics in the 1920s.
p131
aVIn 1944, he wrote a book called "What is Life?"
p132
aVIt was tremendously influential.
p133
aVIt influenced Francis Crick and James Watson,
p134
aVthe discoverers of the double-helix structure of DNA.
p135
aVTo paraphrase a description in the book, he says:
p136
aVAt the molecular level, living organisms have a certain order,
p137
aVa structure to them that's very different
p138
aVfrom the random thermodynamic jostling of atoms and molecules
p139
aVin inanimate matter of the same complexity.
p140
aa(lp141
VIn fact, living matter seems to behave in this order, in a structure,
p142
aVjust like inanimate matter cooled down to near absolute zero,
p143
aVwhere quantum effects play a very important role.
p144
aVThere's something special about the structure \u2014 the order \u2014
p145
aVinside a living cell.
p146
aVSo, Schrödinger speculated that maybe quantum mechanics plays a role in life.
p147
aVIt's a very speculative, far-reaching idea,
p148
aVand it didn't really go very far.
p149
aa(lp150
VBut as I mentioned at the start,
p151
aVin the last 10 years, there have been experiments emerging,
p152
aVshowing where some of these certain phenomena in biology
p153
aVdo seem to require quantum mechanics.
p154
aa(lp155
VI want to share with you just a few of the exciting ones.
p156
aVThis is one of the best-known phenomena in the quantum world,
p157
aVquantum tunneling.
p158
aVThe box on the left shows the wavelike, spread-out distribution
p159
aVof a quantum entity \u2014 a particle, like an electron,
p160
aVwhich is not a little ball bouncing off a wall.
p161
aVIt's a wave that has a certain probability of being able to permeate
p162
aVthrough a solid wall, like a phantom leaping through to the other side.
p163
aVYou can see a faint smudge of light in the right-hand box.
p164
aVQuantum tunneling suggests that a particle can hit an impenetrable barrier,
p165
aVand yet somehow, as though by magic,
p166
aVdisappear from one side and reappear on the other.
p167
aVThe nicest way of explaining it is if you want to throw a ball over a wall,
p168
aVyou have to give it enough energy to get over the top of the wall.
p169
aVIn the quantum world, you don't have to throw it over the wall,
p170
aVyou can throw it at the wall, and there's a certain non-zero probability
p171
aVthat it'll disappear on your side, and reappear on the other.
p172
aa(lp173
VThis isn't speculation, by the way.
p174
aVWe're happy \u2014 well, "happy" is not the right word \u2014
p175
aa(lp176
V(Laughter)
p177
aa(lp178
Vwe are familiar with this.
p179
aa(lp180
V(Laughter)
p181
aa(lp182
VQuantum tunneling takes place all the time;
p183
aVin fact, it's the reason our Sun shines.
p184
aVThe particles fuse together,
p185
aVand the Sun turns hydrogen into helium through quantum tunneling.
p186
aVBack in the 70s and 80s, it was discovered that quantum tunneling also takes place
p187
aVinside living cells.
p188
aVEnzymes, those workhorses of life, the catalysts of chemical reactions \u2014
p189
aVenzymes are biomolecules that speed up chemical reactions in living cells,
p190
aVby many, many orders of magnitude.
p191
aVAnd it's always been a mystery how they do this.
p192
aa(lp193
VWell, it was discovered
p194
aVthat one of the tricks that enzymes have evolved to make use of,
p195
aVis by transferring subatomic particles, like electrons and indeed protons,
p196
aVfrom one part of a molecule to another via quantum tunneling.
p197
aVIt's efficient, it's fast, it can disappear \u2014
p198
aVa proton can disappear from one place, and reappear on the other.
p199
aVEnzymes help this take place.
p200
aa(lp201
VThis is research that's been carried out back in the 80s,
p202
aVparticularly by a group in Berkeley, Judith Klinman.
p203
aVOther groups in the UK have now also confirmed
p204
aVthat enzymes really do this.
p205
aa(lp206
VResearch carried out by my group \u2014
p207
aVso as I mentioned, I'm a nuclear physicist,
p208
aVbut I've realized I've got these tools of using quantum mechanics
p209
aVin atomic nuclei, and so can apply those tools in other areas as well.
p210
aVOne question we asked
p211
aVis whether quantum tunneling plays a role in mutations in DNA.
p212
aVAgain, this is not a new idea; it goes all the way back to the early 60s.
p213
aVThe two strands of DNA, the double-helix structure,
p214
aVare held together by rungs; it's like a twisted ladder.
p215
aVAnd those rungs of the ladder are hydrogen bonds \u2014
p216
aVprotons, that act as the glue between the two strands.
p217
aVSo if you zoom in, what they're doing is holding these large molecules \u2014
p218
aVnucleotides \u2014 together.
p219
aVZoom in a bit more.
p220
aVSo, this a computer simulation.
p221
aVThe two white balls in the middle are protons,
p222
aVand you can see that it's a double hydrogen bond.
p223
aVOne prefers to sit on one side; the other, on the other side
p224
aVof the two strands of the vertical lines going down, which you can't see.
p225
aVIt can happen that these two protons can hop over.
p226
aVWatch the two white balls.
p227
aVThey can jump over to the other side.
p228
aVIf the two strands of DNA then separate, leading to the process of replication,
p229
aVand the two protons are in the wrong positions,
p230
aVthis can lead to a mutation.
p231
aa(lp232
VThis has been known for half a century.
p233
aVThe question is: How likely are they to do that,
p234
aVand if they do, how do they do it?
p235
aVDo they jump across, like the ball going over the wall?
p236
aVOr can they quantum-tunnel across, even if they don't have enough energy?
p237
aVEarly indications suggest that quantum tunneling can play a role here.
p238
aVWe still don't know yet how important it is;
p239
aVthis is still an open question.
p240
aVIt's speculative,
p241
aVbut it's one of those questions that is so important
p242
aVthat if quantum mechanics plays a role in mutations,
p243
aVsurely this must have big implications,
p244
aVto understand certain types of mutations,
p245
aVpossibly even those that lead to turning a cell cancerous.
p246
aa(lp247
VAnother example of quantum mechanics in biology is quantum coherence,
p248
aVin one of the most important processes in biology,
p249
aVphotosynthesis: plants and bacteria taking sunlight,
p250
aVand using that energy to create biomass.
p251
aVQuantum coherence is the idea of quantum entities multitasking.
p252
aVIt's the quantum skier.
p253
aVIt's an object that behaves like a wave,
p254
aVso that it doesn't just move in one direction or the other,
p255
aVbut can follow multiple pathways at the same time.
p256
aa(lp257
VSome years ago, the world of science was shocked
p258
aVwhen a paper was published showing experimental evidence
p259
aVthat quantum coherence takes place inside bacteria,
p260
aVcarrying out photosynthesis.
p261
aVThe idea is that the photon, the particle of light, the sunlight,
p262
aVthe quantum of light captured by a chlorophyll molecule,
p263
aVis then delivered to what's called the reaction center,
p264
aVwhere it can be turned into chemical energy.
p265
aVAnd in getting there, it doesn't just follow one route;
p266
aVit follows multiple pathways at once,
p267
aVto optimize the most efficient way of reaching the reaction center
p268
aVwithout dissipating as waste heat.
p269
aVQuantum coherence taking place inside a living cell.
p270
aVA remarkable idea,
p271
aVand yet evidence is growing almost weekly, with new papers coming out,
p272
aVconfirming that this does indeed take place.
p273
aa(lp274
VMy third and final example is the most beautiful, wonderful idea.
p275
aVIt's also still very speculative, but I have to share it with you.
p276
aVThe European robin migrates from Scandinavia
p277
aVdown to the Mediterranean, every autumn,
p278
aVand like a lot of other marine animals and even insects,
p279
aVthey navigate by sensing the Earth's magnetic field.
p280
aVNow, the Earth's magnetic field is very, very weak;
p281
aVit's 100 times weaker than a fridge magnet,
p282
aVand yet it affects the chemistry \u2014 somehow \u2014 within a living organism.
p283
aVThat's not in doubt \u2014 a German couple of ornithologists,
p284
aVWolfgang and Roswitha Wiltschko, in the 1970s, confirmed that indeed,
p285
aVthe robin does find its way by somehow sensing the Earth's magnetic field,
p286
aVto give it directional information \u2014 a built-in compass.
p287
aa(lp288
VThe puzzle, the mystery was: How does it do it?
p289
aVWell, the only theory in town \u2014
p290
aVwe don't know if it's the correct theory, but the only theory in town \u2014
p291
aVis that it does it via something called quantum entanglement.
p292
aVInside the robin's retina \u2014
p293
aVI kid you not \u2014 inside the robin's retina is a protein called cryptochrome,
p294
aVwhich is light-sensitive.
p295
aVWithin cryptochrome, a pair of electrons are quantum-entangled.
p296
aVNow, quantum entanglement is when two particles are far apart,
p297
aVand yet somehow remain in contact with each other.
p298
aVEven Einstein hated this idea;
p299
aVhe called it "spooky action at a distance."
p300
aa(lp301
V(Laughter)
p302
aa(lp303
VSo if Einstein doesn't like it, then we can all be uncomfortable with it.
p304
aVTwo quantum-entangled electrons within a single molecule
p305
aVdance a delicate dance
p306
aVthat is very sensitive to the direction the bird flies
p307
aVin the Earth's magnetic field.
p308
aa(lp309
VWe don't know if it's the correct explanation,
p310
aVbut wow, wouldn't it be exciting if quantum mechanics helps birds navigate?
p311
aVQuantum biology is still in it infancy.
p312
aVIt's still speculative.
p313
aVBut I believe it's built on solid science.
p314
aVI also think that in the coming decade or so,
p315
aVwe're going to start to see that actually, it pervades life \u2014
p316
aVthat life has evolved tricks that utilize the quantum world.
p317
aVWatch this space.
