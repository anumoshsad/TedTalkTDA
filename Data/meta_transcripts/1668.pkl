V"When the crisis came,
p4
aVthe serious limitations of existing economic and financial models
p5
aVimmediately became apparent."
p6
aV"There is also a strong belief, which I share,
p7
aVthat bad or oversimplistic and overconfident economics
p8
aVhelped create the crisis."
p9
aa(lp10
VNow, you've probably all heard of similar criticism
p11
aVcoming from people who are skeptical of capitalism.
p12
aVBut this is different.
p13
aVThis is coming from the heart of finance.
p14
aVThe first quote is from Jean-Claude Trichet
p15
aVwhen he was governor of the European Central Bank.
p16
aVThe second quote is from the head of the UK Financial Services Authority.
p17
aVAre these people implying
p18
aVthat we don't understand the economic systems
p19
aVthat drive our modern societies?
p20
aVIt gets worse.
p21
aV"We spend billions of dollars
p22
aVtrying to understand the origins of the universe,
p23
aVwhile we still don't understand the conditions for a stable society,
p24
aVa functioning economy, or peace."
p25
aa(lp26
VWhat's happening here? How can this be possible?
p27
aVDo we really understand more about the fabric of reality
p28
aVthan we do about the fabric which emerges from our human interactions?
p29
aVUnfortunately, the answer is yes.
p30
aVBut there's an intriguing solution
p31
aVwhich is coming from what is known as the science of complexity.
p32
aa(lp33
VTo explain what this means and what this thing is,
p34
aVplease let me quickly take a couple of steps back.
p35
aVI ended up in physics by accident.
p36
aVIt was a random encounter when I was young,
p37
aVand since then, I've often wondered about the amazing success of physics
p38
aVin describing the reality we wake up in every day.
p39
aVIn a nutshell, you can think of physics as follows.
p40
aVSo you take a chunk of reality you want to understand
p41
aVand you translate it into mathematics.
p42
aVYou encode it into equations.
p43
aVThen, predictions can be made and tested.
p44
aVWe're actually really lucky that this works,
p45
aVbecause no one really knows why the thoughts in our heads
p46
aVshould actually relate to the fundamental workings of the universe.
p47
aVDespite the success, physics has its limits.
p48
aVAs Dirk Helbing pointed out in the last quote,
p49
aVwe don't really understand the complexity that relates to us, that surrounds us.
p50
aVThis paradox is what got me interested in complex systems.
p51
aVSo these are systems which are made up
p52
aVof many interconnected or interacting parts:
p53
aVswarms of birds or fish,
p54
aVant colonies, ecosystems, brains, financial markets.
p55
aVThese are just a few examples.
p56
aa(lp57
VInterestingly, complex systems are very hard to map
p58
aVinto mathematical equations,
p59
aVso the usual physics approach doesn't really work here.
p60
aVSo what do we know about complex systems?
p61
aVWell, it turns out that what looks like complex behavior from the outside
p62
aVis actually the result of a few simple rules of interaction.
p63
aVThis means you can forget about the equations
p64
aVand just start to understand the system
p65
aVby looking at the interactions,
p66
aVso you can actually forget about the equations
p67
aVand you just start to look at the interactions.
p68
aVAnd it gets even better, because most complex systems
p69
aVhave this amazing property called emergence.
p70
aVSo this means that the system as a whole suddenly starts to show a behavior
p71
aVwhich cannot be understood or predicted
p72
aVby looking at the components of the system.
p73
aVSo the whole is literally more than the sum of its parts.
p74
aVAnd all of this also means
p75
aVthat you can forget about the individual parts of the system,
p76
aVhow complex they are.
p77
aVSo if it's a cell or a termite or a bird,
p78
aVyou just focus on the rules of interaction.
p79
aa(lp80
VAs a result, networks are ideal representations of complex systems.
p81
aVThe nodes in the network are the system's components,
p82
aVand the links are given by the interactions.
p83
aVSo what equations are for physics,
p84
aVcomplex networks are for the study of complex systems.
p85
aa(lp86
VThis approach has been very successfully applied
p87
aVto many complex systems in physics, biology,
p88
aVcomputer science, the social sciences,
p89
aVbut what about economics?
p90
aVWhere are economic networks?
p91
aVThis is a surprising and prominent gap in the literature.
p92
aVThe study we published last year, called "The Network of Global Corporate Control,"
p93
aVwas the first extensive analysis of economic networks.
p94
aVThe study went viral on the Internet
p95
aVand it attracted a lot of attention from the international media.
p96
aVThis is quite remarkable, because, again, why did no one look at this before?
p97
aVSimilar data has been around for quite some time.
p98
aa(lp99
VWhat we looked at in detail was ownership networks.
p100
aVSo here the nodes are companies, people, governments, foundations, etc.
p101
aVAnd the links represent the shareholding relations,
p102
aVso shareholder A has x percent of the shares in company B.
p103
aVAnd we also assign a value to the company given by the operating revenue.
p104
aVSo ownership networks reveal the patterns of shareholding relations.
p105
aVIn this little example, you can see a few financial institutions
p106
aVwith some of the many links highlighted.
p107
aa(lp108
VNow, you may think that no one looked at this before
p109
aVbecause ownership networks are really, really boring to study.
p110
aVWell, as ownership is related to control,
p111
aVas I shall explain later,
p112
aVlooking at ownership networks
p113
aVactually can give you answers to questions like,
p114
aVwho are the key players?
p115
aVHow are they organized? Are they isolated?
p116
aVAre they interconnected?
p117
aVAnd what is the overall distribution of control?
p118
aVIn other words, who controls the world?
p119
aVI think this is an interesting question.
p120
aa(lp121
VAnd it has implications for systemic risk.
p122
aVThis is a measure of how vulnerable a system is overall.
p123
aVA high degree of interconnectivity can be bad for stability,
p124
aVbecause then the stress can spread through the system like an epidemic.
p125
aa(lp126
VScientists have sometimes criticized economists
p127
aVwho believe ideas and concepts are more important than empirical data,
p128
aVbecause a foundational guideline in science is:
p129
aVLet the data speak. OK. Let's do that.
p130
aa(lp131
VSo we started with a database containing 13 million ownership relations from 2007.
p132
aVThis is a lot of data, and because we wanted to find out
p133
aV"who rules the world,"
p134
aVwe decided to focus on transnational corporations,
p135
aVor "TNCs," for short.
p136
aVThese are companies that operate in more than one country,
p137
aVand we found 43,000.
p138
aVIn the next step, we built the network around these companies,
p139
aVso we took all the TNCs' shareholders,
p140
aVand the shareholders' shareholders, etc.,
p141
aVall the way upstream, and we did the same downstream,
p142
aVand ended up with a network containing 600,000 nodes
p143
aVand one million links.
p144
aVThis is the TNC network which we analyzed.
p145
aa(lp146
VAnd it turns out to be structured as follows.
p147
aVSo you have a periphery and a center
p148
aVwhich contains about 75 percent of all the players,
p149
aVand in the center, there's this tiny but dominant core
p150
aVwhich is made up of highly interconnected companies.
p151
aVTo give you a better picture,
p152
aVthink about a metropolitan area.
p153
aVSo you have the suburbs and the periphery,
p154
aVyou have a center, like a financial district,
p155
aVthen the core will be something like
p156
aVthe tallest high-rise building in the center.
p157
aVAnd we already see signs of organization going on here.
p158
aV36 percent of the TNCs are in the core only,
p159
aVbut they make up 95 percent of the total operating revenue of all TNCs.
p160
aa(lp161
VOK, so now we analyzed the structure,
p162
aVso how does this relate to the control?
p163
aVWell, ownership gives voting rights to shareholders.
p164
aVThis is the normal notion of control.
p165
aVAnd there are different models
p166
aVwhich allow you to compute the control you get from ownership.
p167
aVIf you have more than 50 percent of the shares in a company,
p168
aVyou get control,
p169
aVbut usually, it depends on the relative distribution of shares.
p170
aVAnd the network really matters.
p171
aVAbout 10 years ago, Mr. Tronchetti Provera
p172
aVhad ownership and control in a small company,
p173
aVwhich had ownership and control in a bigger company.
p174
aVYou get the idea.
p175
aVThis ended up giving him control in Telecom Italia with a leverage of 26.
p176
aVSo this means that, with each euro he invested,
p177
aVhe was able to move 26 euros of market value
p178
aVthrough the chain of ownership relations.
p179
aa(lp180
VNow what we actually computed in our study was the control over the TNCs' value.
p181
aVThis allowed us to assign a degree of influence to each shareholder.
p182
aVThis is very much in the sense of Max Weber's idea of potential power,
p183
aVwhich is the probability of imposing one's own will
p184
aVdespite the opposition of others.
p185
aa(lp186
VIf you want to compute the flow in an ownership network,
p187
aVthis is what you have to do.
p188
aVIt's actually not that hard to understand.
p189
aVLet me explain by giving you this analogy.
p190
aVSo think about water flowing in pipes, where the pipes have different thickness.
p191
aVSo similarly, the control is flowing in the ownership networks
p192
aVand is accumulating at the nodes.
p193
aVSo what did we find after computing all this network control?
p194
aVWell, it turns out that the 737 top shareholders
p195
aVhave the potential to collectively control 80 percent of the TNCs' value.
p196
aVNow remember, we started out with 600,000 nodes,
p197
aVso these 737 top players make up a bit more than 0.1 percent.
p198
aVThey're mostly financial institutions in the US and the UK.
p199
aVAnd it gets even more extreme.
p200
aVThere are 146 top players in the core,
p201
aVand they together have the potential to collectively control
p202
aV40 percent of the TNCs' value.
p203
aa(lp204
VWhat should you take home from all of this?
p205
aVWell, the high degree of control you saw is very extreme by any standard.
p206
aVThe high degree of interconnectivity of the top players in the core
p207
aVcould pose a significant systemic risk to the global economy.
p208
aVAnd we could easily reproduce the TNC network
p209
aVwith a few simple rules.
p210
aVThis means that its structure is probably the result of self-organization.
p211
aVIt's an emergent property which depends on the rules of interaction in the system,
p212
aVso it's probably not the result of a top-down approach
p213
aVlike a global conspiracy.
p214
aa(lp215
VOur study "is an impression of the moon's surface.
p216
aVIt's not a street map."
p217
aVSo you should take the exact numbers in our study with a grain of salt,
p218
aVyet it "gave us a tantalizing glimpse of a brave new world of finance."
p219
aVWe hope to have opened the door for more such research in this direction,
p220
aVso the remaining unknown terrain will be charted in the future.
p221
aVAnd this is slowly starting.
p222
aVWe're seeing the emergence of long-term and highly-funded programs
p223
aVwhich aim at understanding our networked world
p224
aVfrom a complexity point of view.
p225
aVBut this journey has only just begun,
p226
aVso we will have to wait before we see the first results.
p227
aa(lp228
VNow there is still a big problem, in my opinion.
p229
aVIdeas relating to finance, economics, politics, society,
p230
aVare very often tainted by people's personal ideologies.
p231
aVI really hope that this complexity perspective
p232
aVallows for some common ground to be found.
p233
aVIt would be really great if it has the power
p234
aVto help end the gridlock created by conflicting ideas,
p235
aVwhich appears to be paralyzing our globalized world.
p236
aVReality is so complex, we need to move away from dogma.
p237
aVBut this is just my own personal ideology.
