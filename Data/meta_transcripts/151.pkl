VWell, first of all, let me thank Emeka \u2014 as a matter of fact,
p4
aVTED Global \u2014 for putting this conference together.
p5
aVThis conference is going to rank as the most important
p6
aVin the beginning of the 21st century.
p7
aVThink African governments will put together a conference like this?
p8
aVYou think the A.U. will put together a conference like this?
p9
aVEven before they do that they will ask for foreign aid.
p10
aVI would also like to pay homage and honor to the TED Fellows
p11
aVJune Arunga, James Shikwati, Andrew, and the other TED Fellows.
p12
aVI call them the Cheetah Generation.
p13
aVThe Cheetah Generation is a new breed of Africans
p14
aVwho brook no nonsense about corruption.
p15
aVThey understand what accountability and democracy is.
p16
aVThey're not going to wait for government to do things for them.
p17
aVThat's the Cheetah Generation,
p18
aVand Africa's salvation rests on the backs of these Cheetahs.
p19
aVIn contrast, of course, we have the Hippo Generation.
p20
aa(lp21
V(Laughter)
p22
aa(lp23
VThe Hippo Generation are the ruling elites.
p24
aVThey are stuck in their intellectual patch.
p25
aVComplaining about colonialism and imperialism,
p26
aVthey wouldn't move one foot.
p27
aVIf you ask them to reform the economies,
p28
aVthey're not going to reform it
p29
aVbecause they benefit from the rotten status quo.
p30
aVNow, there are a lot of Africans who are very angry,
p31
aVangry at the condition of Africa.
p32
aVNow, we're talking about a continent that is not poor.
p33
aVIt is rich in mineral resources, natural mineral resources.
p34
aVBut the mineral wealth of Africa is not being utilized
p35
aVto lift its people out of poverty.
p36
aVThat's what makes a lot of Africans very angry.
p37
aVAnd in a way, Africa is more than a tragedy, in more ways than one.
p38
aVThere's another enduring tragedy, and that tragedy is that
p39
aVthere are so many people, so many governments,
p40
aVso many organizations who want to help the people in Africa.
p41
aVThey don't understand.
p42
aVNow, we're not saying don't help Africa.
p43
aVHelping Africa is noble.
p44
aVBut helping Africa has been turned into a theater of the absurd.
p45
aVIt's like the blind leading the clueless.
p46
aa(lp47
V(Laughter)
p48
aa(lp49
VThere are certain things that we need to recognize.
p50
aVAfrica's begging-bowl leaks.
p51
aVDid you know that 40 percent of the wealth created in Africa
p52
aVis not invested here in Africa?
p53
aVIt's taken out of Africa.
p54
aVThat's what the World Bank says.
p55
aVLook at Africa's begging-bowl.
p56
aVIt leaks horribly.
p57
aVThere are people who think that we should pour more money,
p58
aVmore aid into this bowl which leaks.
p59
aVWhat are the leakages?
p60
aVCorruption alone costs Africa 148 billion dollars a year.
p61
aVYes, put that aside.
p62
aVCapital flight out of Africa, 80 billion a year.
p63
aVPut that aside.
p64
aVLet's take food imports.
p65
aVEvery year Africa spends 20 billion dollars to import food.
p66
aVJust add that up, all these leakages.
p67
aVThat's far more than the 50 billion Tony Blair wants to raise for Africa.
p68
aVNow, back in the 1960s Africa not only fed itself,
p69
aVit also exported food.
p70
aVNot anymore.
p71
aa(lp72
VWe know that something has gone fundamentally wrong.
p73
aVYou know it, I know it, but let's not waste our time
p74
aVtalking about these mistakes because we'll spend all day here.
p75
aVLet's move on, and flip over to the next chapter,
p76
aVand that's what this conference is all about \u2014 the next chapter.
p77
aVThe next chapter begins with first of all, asking ourselves
p78
aVthis fundamental question,
p79
aV"Whom do we want to help in Africa?"
p80
aVThere is the people, and then there is the government or leaders.
p81
aVNow, the previous speaker before me,
p82
aVIdris Mohammed, indicated that
p83
aVwe've had abysmal leadership in Africa.
p84
aVThat characterization, in my view, is even more charitable.
p85
aa(lp86
V(Laughter)
p87
aa(lp88
VI belong to an Internet discussion forum,
p89
aVan African Internet discussion forum,
p90
aVand I asked them, I said, "Since 1960, we've had exactly
p91
aV204 African heads of state, since 1960."
p92
aVAnd I asked them to name me just 20 good leaders,
p93
aVjust 20 good leaders \u2014
p94
aVyou may want to take this leadership challenge yourself.
p95
aVI asked them to name me just 20.
p96
aVEverybody mentioned Nelson Mandela, of course.
p97
aVKwame Nkrumah, Nyerere, Kenyatta \u2014 somebody mentioned Idi Amin.
p98
aa(lp99
V(Laughter)
p100
aa(lp101
VI let that pass.
p102
aa(lp103
V(Laughter)
p104
aa(lp105
VMy point is, they couldn't go beyond 15.
p106
aVEven if they had been able to name me 20,
p107
aVwhat does that tell you?
p108
aV20 out of 204 means that the vast majority
p109
aVof the African leaders failed their people.
p110
aVAnd if you look at them, the slate of the post-colonial leaders \u2014
p111
aVan assortment of military fufu heads,
p112
aVSwiss-bank socialists, crocodile liberators, vampire elites,
p113
aVquack revolutionaries.
p114
aa(lp115
V(Applause)
p116
aa(lp117
VNow, this leadership is a far cry from the traditional leaders
p118
aVthat Africans have known for centuries.
p119
aVThe second false premise that we make
p120
aVwhen we're trying to help Africa
p121
aVis that sometimes we think that there is something called
p122
aVa government in Africa that cares about its people,
p123
aVserves the interests of the people, and represents the people.
p124
aVThere is one particular quote \u2014 a Lesotho chief once said
p125
aVthat "Here in Lesotho, we've got two problems:
p126
aVrats and the government."
p127
aa(lp128
V(Laughter)
p129
aa(lp130
VWhat you and I understand as a government
p131
aVdoesn't exist in many African countries.
p132
aVIn fact, what we call our governments are vampire states.
p133
aVVampires because they suck
p134
aVthe economic vitality out of their people.
p135
aVGovernment is the problem in Africa.
p136
aVA vampire state is the government \u2014
p137
aV(Applause)
p138
aV\u2014 which has been hijacked by a phalanx of bandits and crooks
p139
aVwho use the instruments of state power to enrich themselves,
p140
aVtheir cronies, and tribesmen and exclude everybody else.
p141
aVThe richest people in Africa are heads-of-state and ministers,
p142
aVand quite often the chief bandit is the head-of-state himself.
p143
aVWhere do they get their money?
p144
aVBy creating wealth?
p145
aVNo.
p146
aVBy raking it off the backs of their suffering people.
p147
aVThat's not wealth creation. It's wealth redistribution.
p148
aa(lp149
VThe third fundamental issue that we have to recognize
p150
aVis that if we want to help the African people,
p151
aVwe must know where the African people are.
p152
aVTake any African economy.
p153
aVAn African economy can be broken up into three sectors.
p154
aVThere is the modern sector, there is the informal sector
p155
aVand the traditional sector.
p156
aVThe modern sector is the abode of the elites.
p157
aVIt's the seat of government.
p158
aVIn many African countries the modern sector is lost.
p159
aVIt's dysfunctional.
p160
aVIt is a meretricious fandango of imported systems,
p161
aVwhich the elites themselves don't understand.
p162
aVThat is the source of many of Africa's problems
p163
aVwhere the struggles for political power emanate
p164
aVand then spill over onto the informal and the traditional sector,
p165
aVclaiming innocent lives.
p166
aa(lp167
VNow the modern sector, of course,
p168
aVis where a lot of the development aid and resources went into.
p169
aVMore than 80 percent of Ivory Coast's development
p170
aVwent into the modern sector.
p171
aVThe other sectors, the informal and the traditional sectors,
p172
aVare where you find the majority of the African people,
p173
aVthe real people in Africa. That's where you find them.
p174
aVNow, obviously it makes common sense
p175
aVthat if you want to help the people, you go where the people are.
p176
aVBut that's not what we did.
p177
aVAs a matter of fact,
p178
aVwe neglected the informal and the traditional sectors.
p179
aVNow, traditional sector is where Africa produces its agriculture,
p180
aVwhich is one of the reasons why Africa can't feed itself,
p181
aVand that's why it must import food.
p182
aa(lp183
VAll right, you cannot develop Africa by ignoring
p184
aVthe informal and the traditional sectors.
p185
aVAnd you can't develop the informal and the traditional sectors
p186
aVwithout an operational understanding of how these two sectors work.
p187
aVThese two sectors, let me describe to you,
p188
aVhave their own indigenous institutions.
p189
aVFirst one is the political system.
p190
aVTraditionally, Africans hate governments. They hate tyranny.
p191
aVIf you look into their traditional systems,
p192
aVAfricans organize their states in two types.
p193
aVThe first one belongs to those ethnic societies
p194
aVwho believe that the state was necessarily tyrannous,
p195
aVso they didn't want to have anything to do
p196
aVwith any centralized authority.
p197
aVThese societies are the Ibo, the Somali, the Kikuyus,
p198
aVfor example. They have no chiefs.
p199
aa(lp200
VThe other ethnic groups, which did have chiefs,
p201
aVmade sure that they surrounded the chiefs
p202
aVwith councils upon councils upon councils
p203
aVto prevent them from abusing their power.
p204
aVIn Ashanti tradition, for example,
p205
aVthe chief cannot make any decision
p206
aVwithout the concurrence of the council of elders.
p207
aVWithout the council the chief can't pass any law,
p208
aVand if the chief doesn't govern according to the will of the people
p209
aVhe will be removed.
p210
aVIf not, the people will abandon the chief,
p211
aVgo somewhere else and set up a new settlement.
p212
aVAnd even if you look in ancient African empires,
p213
aVthey were all organized around one particular principle \u2014
p214
aVthe confederacy principle,
p215
aVwhich is characterized by a great deal of devolution of authority,
p216
aVdecentralization of power.
p217
aa(lp218
VNow, this is what I have described to you.
p219
aVThis is part of Africa's indigenous political heritage.
p220
aVNow, compare that to the modern systems
p221
aVthe ruling elites established on Africa.
p222
aVIt is a total far cry.
p223
aVIn the economic system in traditional Africa,
p224
aVthe means of production is privately owned.
p225
aVIt's owned by extended families.
p226
aVYou see, in the West, the basic economic and social unit
p227
aVis the individual.
p228
aVThe American will say, "I am because I am,
p229
aVand I can damn well do anything I want, anytime."
p230
aVThe accent is on the "I."
p231
aVIn Africa, the Africans say, "I am, because we are."
p232
aVThe "we" connotes community \u2014 the extended family system.
p233
aVThe extended family system pools its resources together.
p234
aa(lp235
VThey own farms. They decide what to do, what to produce.
p236
aVThey don't take any orders from their chiefs.
p237
aVThey decide what to do.
p238
aVAnd when they produce their crops, they sell the surplus
p239
aVon marketplaces.
p240
aVWhen they make a profit it is theirs to keep,
p241
aVnot for the chief to sequester it from them.
p242
aVSo, in a nutshell, what we had in traditional Africa
p243
aVwas a free-market system.
p244
aVThere were markets in Africa
p245
aVbefore the colonialists stepped foot on the continent.
p246
aVTimbuktu was one great big market town.
p247
aVKano, Salaga \u2014 they were all there.
p248
aVEven if you go to West Africa, you notice that market activity
p249
aVin West Africa has always been dominated by women.
p250
aVSo, it's quite appropriate that this section is called
p251
aVa marketplace.
p252
aVThe market is not alien to Africa.
p253
aa(lp254
VWhat Africans practiced was a different form of capitalism,
p255
aVbut then after independence, all of a sudden,
p256
aVmarkets, capitalism became a western institution,
p257
aVand the leaders said Africans were ready for socialism.
p258
aVNonsense.
p259
aVAnd even then, what kind of socialism did they practice?
p260
aVThe socialism that they practiced was a peculiar form of
p261
aVSwiss-bank socialism,
p262
aVwhich allowed the heads of states and the ministers
p263
aVto rape and plunder Africa's
p264
aVtreasuries for deposit in Switzerland.
p265
aVThat is not the kind of system Africans had known for centuries.
p266
aVWhat do we do now?
p267
aVGo back to Africa's indigenous institutions,
p268
aVand this is where we charge the Cheetahs to go into the informal sectors,
p269
aVthe traditional sectors.
p270
aVThat's where you find the African people.
p271
aa(lp272
VAnd I'd like to show you a quick little video
p273
aVabout the informal sector, about the boat-building
p274
aVthat I, myself, tried to mobilize Africans in the Diaspora
p275
aVto invest in.
p276
aVCould you please show that?
p277
aVThe men are going fishing in these small boats.
p278
aVYes, it's an enterprise.
p279
aVThis is by a local Ghanaian entrepreneur, using his own capital.
p280
aVHe's getting no assistance from the government,
p281
aVand he's building a second, bigger boat.
p282
aVA bigger boat will mean more fish will be caught and landed.
p283
aVIt means that he will be able to employ more Ghanaians.
p284
aVIt also means that he will be able to generate wealth.
p285
aVAnd then it will have what economists call
p286
aVexternal effects on a local economy.
p287
aVAll that you need to do, all that the elites need to do,
p288
aVis to move this operation into something that is enclosed
p289
aVso that the operation can be made more efficient.
p290
aa(lp291
VNow, it is not just this informal sector.
p292
aVThere is also traditional medicine.
p293
aV80 percent of Africans still rely on traditional medicine.
p294
aVThe modern healthcare sector has totally collapsed.
p295
aVNow, this is an area \u2014 I mean, there is a treasure trove of wealth
p296
aVin the traditional medicine area.
p297
aVThis is where we need to mobilize Africans,
p298
aVin the Diaspora especially, to invest in this.
p299
aVWe also need to mobilize Africans in the Diaspora,
p300
aVnot only to go into the traditional sectors,
p301
aVbut to go into agriculture and also to instigate change from within.
p302
aVWe were able to mobilize Ghanaians in the Diaspora
p303
aVto instigate change in Ghana and bring about democracy in Ghana.
p304
aVAnd I know that with the Cheetahs, we can take Africa back
p305
aVone village at a time.
p306
aVThank you very much.
