VWell this is a really extraordinary honor for me.
p4
aVI spend most of my time
p5
aVin jails, in prisons, on death row.
p6
aVI spend most of my time in very low-income communities
p7
aVin the projects and places where there's a great deal of hopelessness.
p8
aVAnd being here at TED
p9
aVand seeing the stimulation, hearing it,
p10
aVhas been very, very energizing to me.
p11
aVAnd one of the things that's emerged in my short time here
p12
aVis that TED has an identity.
p13
aVAnd you can actually say things here
p14
aVthat have impacts around the world.
p15
aVAnd sometimes when it comes through TED,
p16
aVit has meaning and power
p17
aVthat it doesn't have when it doesn't.
p18
aa(lp19
VAnd I mention that because I think identity is really important.
p20
aVAnd we've had some fantastic presentations.
p21
aVAnd I think what we've learned
p22
aVis that, if you're a teacher your words can be meaningful,
p23
aVbut if you're a compassionate teacher,
p24
aVthey can be especially meaningful.
p25
aVIf you're a doctor you can do some good things,
p26
aVbut if you're a caring doctor you can do some other things.
p27
aVAnd so I want to talk about the power of identity.
p28
aVAnd I didn't learn about this actually
p29
aVpracticing law and doing the work that I do.
p30
aVI actually learned about this from my grandmother.
p31
aa(lp32
VI grew up in a house
p33
aVthat was the traditional African-American home
p34
aVthat was dominated by a matriarch,
p35
aVand that matriarch was my grandmother.
p36
aVShe was tough, she was strong,
p37
aVshe was powerful.
p38
aVShe was the end of every argument in our family.
p39
aVShe was the beginning of a lot of arguments in our family.
p40
aVShe was the daughter of people who were actually enslaved.
p41
aVHer parents were born in slavery in Virginia in the 1840's.
p42
aVShe was born in the 1880's
p43
aVand the experience of slavery
p44
aVvery much shaped the way she saw the world.
p45
aa(lp46
VAnd my grandmother was tough, but she was also loving.
p47
aVWhen I would see her as a little boy,
p48
aVshe'd come up to me and she'd give me these hugs.
p49
aVAnd she'd squeeze me so tight I could barely breathe
p50
aVand then she'd let me go.
p51
aVAnd an hour or two later, if I saw her,
p52
aVshe'd come over to me and she'd say, "Bryan, do you still feel me hugging you?"
p53
aVAnd if I said, "No," she'd assault me again,
p54
aVand if I said, "Yes," she'd leave me alone.
p55
aVAnd she just had this quality
p56
aVthat you always wanted to be near her.
p57
aVAnd the only challenge was that she had 10 children.
p58
aVMy mom was the youngest of her 10 kids.
p59
aVAnd sometimes when I would go and spend time with her,
p60
aVit would be difficult to get her time and attention.
p61
aVMy cousins would be running around everywhere.
p62
aa(lp63
VAnd I remember, when I was about eight or nine years old,
p64
aVwaking up one morning, going into the living room,
p65
aVand all of my cousins were running around.
p66
aVAnd my grandmother was sitting across the room
p67
aVstaring at me.
p68
aVAnd at first I thought we were playing a game.
p69
aVAnd I would look at her and I'd smile,
p70
aVbut she was very serious.
p71
aVAnd after about 15 or 20 minutes of this,
p72
aVshe got up and she came across the room
p73
aVand she took me by the hand
p74
aVand she said, "Come on, Bryan. You and I are going to have a talk."
p75
aVAnd I remember this just like it happened yesterday.
p76
aVI never will forget it.
p77
aa(lp78
VShe took me out back and she said, "Bryan, I'm going to tell you something,
p79
aVbut you don't tell anybody what I tell you."
p80
aVI said, "Okay, Mama."
p81
aVShe said, "Now you make sure you don't do that." I said, "Sure."
p82
aVThen she sat me down and she looked at me
p83
aVand she said, "I want you to know
p84
aVI've been watching you."
p85
aVAnd she said, "I think you're special."
p86
aVShe said, "I think you can do anything you want to do."
p87
aVI will never forget it.
p88
aa(lp89
VAnd then she said, "I just need you to promise me three things, Bryan."
p90
aVI said, "Okay, Mama."
p91
aVShe said, "The first thing I want you to promise me
p92
aVis that you'll always love your mom."
p93
aVShe said, "That's my baby girl,
p94
aVand you have to promise me now you'll always take care of her."
p95
aVWell I adored my mom, so I said, "Yes, Mama. I'll do that."
p96
aVThen she said, "The second thing I want you to promise me
p97
aVis that you'll always do the right thing
p98
aVeven when the right thing is the hard thing."
p99
aVAnd I thought about it and I said, "Yes, Mama. I'll do that."
p100
aVThen finally she said, "The third thing I want you to promise me
p101
aVis that you'll never drink alcohol."
p102
aV(Laughter)
p103
aVWell I was nine years old, so I said, "Yes, Mama. I'll do that."
p104
aa(lp105
VI grew up in the country in the rural South,
p106
aVand I have a brother a year older than me and a sister a year younger.
p107
aVWhen I was about 14 or 15,
p108
aVone day my brother came home and he had this six-pack of beer \u2014
p109
aVI don't know where he got it \u2014
p110
aVand he grabbed me and my sister and we went out in the woods.
p111
aVAnd we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we crazily did.
p112
aVAnd he had a sip of this beer and he gave some to my sister and she had some,
p113
aVand they offered it to me.
p114
aVI said, "No, no, no. That's okay. You all go ahead. I'm not going to have any beer."
p115
aVMy brother said, "Come on. We're doing this today; you always do what we do.
p116
aVI had some, your sister had some. Have some beer."
p117
aVI said, "No, I don't feel right about that. Y'all go ahead. Y'all go ahead."
p118
aVAnd then my brother started staring at me.
p119
aVHe said, "What's wrong with you? Have some beer."
p120
aVThen he looked at me real hard and he said,
p121
aV"Oh, I hope you're not still hung up
p122
aVon that conversation Mama had with you."
p123
aV(Laughter)
p124
aVI said, "Well, what are you talking about?"
p125
aVHe said, "Oh, Mama tells all the grandkids that they're special."
p126
aV(Laughter)
p127
aVI was devastated.
p128
aa(lp129
V(Laughter)
p130
aa(lp131
VAnd I'm going to admit something to you.
p132
aVI'm going to tell you something I probably shouldn't.
p133
aVI know this might be broadcast broadly.
p134
aVBut I'm 52 years old,
p135
aVand I'm going to admit to you
p136
aVthat I've never had a drop of alcohol.
p137
aV(Applause)
p138
aVI don't say that because I think that's virtuous;
p139
aVI say that because there is power in identity.
p140
aVWhen we create the right kind of identity,
p141
aVwe can say things to the world around us
p142
aVthat they don't actually believe makes sense.
p143
aVWe can get them to do things
p144
aVthat they don't think they can do.
p145
aVWhen I thought about my grandmother,
p146
aVof course she would think all her grandkids were special.
p147
aVMy grandfather was in prison during prohibition.
p148
aVMy male uncles died of alcohol-related diseases.
p149
aVAnd these were the things she thought we needed to commit to.
p150
aa(lp151
VWell I've been trying to say something
p152
aVabout our criminal justice system.
p153
aVThis country is very different today
p154
aVthan it was 40 years ago.
p155
aVIn 1972, there were 300,000 people in jails and prisons.
p156
aVToday, there are 2.3 million.
p157
aVThe United States now has the highest rate of incarceration
p158
aVin the world.
p159
aVWe have seven million people on probation and parole.
p160
aVAnd mass incarceration, in my judgment,
p161
aVhas fundamentally changed our world.
p162
aVIn poor communities, in communities of color
p163
aVthere is this despair,
p164
aVthere is this hopelessness,
p165
aVthat is being shaped by these outcomes.
p166
aVOne out of three black men
p167
aVbetween the ages of 18 and 30
p168
aVis in jail, in prison, on probation or parole.
p169
aVIn urban communities across this country \u2014
p170
aVLos Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington \u2014
p171
aV50 to 60 percent of all young men of color are
p172
aVin jail or prison or on probation or parole.
p173
aa(lp174
VOur system isn't just being shaped
p175
aVin these ways that seem to be distorting around race,
p176
aVthey're also distorted by poverty.
p177
aVWe have a system of justice in this country
p178
aVthat treats you much better
p179
aVif you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent.
p180
aVWealth, not culpability,
p181
aVshapes outcomes.
p182
aVAnd yet, we seem to be very comfortable.
p183
aVThe politics of fear and anger
p184
aVhave made us believe
p185
aVthat these are problems that are not our problems.
p186
aVWe've been disconnected.
p187
aa(lp188
VIt's interesting to me.
p189
aVWe're looking at some very interesting developments in our work.
p190
aVMy state of Alabama, like a number of states,
p191
aVactually permanently disenfranchises you
p192
aVif you have a criminal conviction.
p193
aVRight now in Alabama
p194
aV34 percent of the black male population
p195
aVhas permanently lost the right to vote.
p196
aVWe're actually projecting in another 10 years
p197
aVthe level of disenfranchisement
p198
aVwill be as high as it's been
p199
aVsince prior to the passage of the Voting Rights Act.
p200
aVAnd there is this stunning silence.
p201
aa(lp202
VI represent children.
p203
aVA lot of my clients are very young.
p204
aVThe United States is the only country in the world
p205
aVwhere we sentence 13-year-old children
p206
aVto die in prison.
p207
aVWe have life imprisonment without parole for kids in this country.
p208
aVAnd we're actually doing some litigation.
p209
aVThe only country in the world.
p210
aa(lp211
VI represent people on death row.
p212
aVIt's interesting, this question of the death penalty.
p213
aVIn many ways, we've been taught to think
p214
aVthat the real question is,
p215
aVdo people deserve to die for the crimes they've committed?
p216
aVAnd that's a very sensible question.
p217
aVBut there's another way of thinking
p218
aVabout where we are in our identity.
p219
aVThe other way of thinking about it
p220
aVis not, do people deserve to die for the crimes they commit,
p221
aVbut do we deserve to kill?
p222
aVI mean, it's fascinating.
p223
aa(lp224
VDeath penalty in America is defined by error.
p225
aVFor every nine people who have been executed,
p226
aVwe've actually identified one innocent person
p227
aVwho's been exonerated and released from death row.
p228
aVA kind of astonishing error rate \u2014
p229
aVone out of nine people innocent.
p230
aVI mean, it's fascinating.
p231
aVIn aviation, we would never let people fly on airplanes
p232
aVif for every nine planes that took off
p233
aVone would crash.
p234
aVBut somehow we can insulate ourselves from this problem.
p235
aVIt's not our problem.
p236
aVIt's not our burden.
p237
aVIt's not our struggle.
p238
aa(lp239
VI talk a lot about these issues.
p240
aVI talk about race and this question
p241
aVof whether we deserve to kill.
p242
aVAnd it's interesting, when I teach my students about African-American history,
p243
aVI tell them about slavery.
p244
aVI tell them about terrorism,
p245
aVthe era that began at the end of reconstruction
p246
aVthat went on to World War II.
p247
aVWe don't really know very much about it.
p248
aVBut for African-Americans in this country,
p249
aVthat was an era defined by terror.
p250
aVIn many communities, people had to worry about being lynched.
p251
aVThey had to worry about being bombed.
p252
aVIt was the threat of terror that shaped their lives.
p253
aVAnd these older people come up to me now
p254
aVand they say, "Mr. Stevenson, you give talks, you make speeches,
p255
aVyou tell people to stop saying
p256
aVwe're dealing with terrorism for the first time in our nation's history
p257
aVafter 9/11."
p258
aVThey tell me to say, "No, tell them that we grew up with that."
p259
aVAnd that era of terrorism, of course,
p260
aVwas followed by segregation
p261
aVand decades of racial subordination
p262
aVand apartheid.
p263
aa(lp264
VAnd yet, we have in this country this dynamic
p265
aVwhere we really don't like to talk about our problems.
p266
aVWe don't like to talk about our history.
p267
aVAnd because of that, we really haven't understood
p268
aVwhat it's meant to do the things we've done historically.
p269
aVWe're constantly running into each other.
p270
aVWe're constantly creating tensions and conflicts.
p271
aVWe have a hard time talking about race,
p272
aVand I believe it's because we are unwilling to commit ourselves
p273
aVto a process of truth and reconciliation.
p274
aVIn South Africa, people understood
p275
aVthat we couldn't overcome apartheid
p276
aVwithout a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
p277
aVIn Rwanda, even after the genocide, there was this commitment,
p278
aVbut in this country we haven't done that.
p279
aa(lp280
VI was giving some lectures in Germany about the death penalty.
p281
aVIt was fascinating
p282
aVbecause one of the scholars stood up after the presentation
p283
aVand said, "Well you know it's deeply troubling
p284
aVto hear what you're talking about."
p285
aVHe said, "We don't have the death penalty in Germany.
p286
aVAnd of course, we can never have the death penalty in Germany."
p287
aVAnd the room got very quiet,
p288
aVand this woman said,
p289
aV"There's no way, with our history,
p290
aVwe could ever engage
p291
aVin the systematic killing of human beings.
p292
aVIt would be unconscionable for us
p293
aVto, in an intentional and deliberate way,
p294
aVset about executing people."
p295
aVAnd I thought about that.
p296
aVWhat would it feel like
p297
aVto be living in a world
p298
aVwhere the nation state of Germany was executing people,
p299
aVespecially if they were disproportionately Jewish?
p300
aVI couldn't bear it.
p301
aVIt would be unconscionable.
p302
aa(lp303
VAnd yet, in this country,
p304
aVin the states of the Old South,
p305
aVwe execute people \u2014
p306
aVwhere you're 11 times more likely to get the death penalty
p307
aVif the victim is white than if the victim is black,
p308
aV22 times more likely to get it
p309
aVif the defendant is black and the victim is white \u2014
p310
aVin the very states where there are buried in the ground
p311
aVthe bodies of people who were lynched.
p312
aVAnd yet, there is this disconnect.
p313
aa(lp314
VWell I believe that our identity is at risk.
p315
aVThat when we actually don't care
p316
aVabout these difficult things,
p317
aVthe positive and wonderful things
p318
aVare nonetheless implicated.
p319
aVWe love innovation.
p320
aVWe love technology. We love creativity.
p321
aVWe love entertainment.
p322
aVBut ultimately,
p323
aVthose realities
p324
aVare shadowed by suffering,
p325
aVabuse, degradation,
p326
aVmarginalization.
p327
aVAnd for me, it becomes necessary
p328
aVto integrate the two.
p329
aVBecause ultimately we are talking
p330
aVabout a need to be more hopeful,
p331
aVmore committed, more dedicated
p332
aVto the basic challenges of living in a complex world.
p333
aVAnd for me that means
p334
aVspending time thinking and talking
p335
aVabout the poor, the disadvantaged,
p336
aVthose who will never get to TED.
p337
aVBut thinking about them in a way
p338
aVthat is integrated in our own lives.
p339
aa(lp340
VYou know ultimately, we all have to believe things we haven't seen.
p341
aVWe do. As rational as we are, as committed to intellect as we are.
p342
aVInnovation, creativity,
p343
aVdevelopment comes
p344
aVnot from the ideas in our mind alone.
p345
aVThey come from the ideas in our mind
p346
aVthat are also fueled
p347
aVby some conviction in our heart.
p348
aVAnd it's that mind-heart connection
p349
aVthat I believe compels us
p350
aVto not just be attentive
p351
aVto all the bright and dazzly things,
p352
aVbut also the dark and difficult things.
p353
aVVaclav Havel, the great Czech leader, talked about this.
p354
aVHe said, "When we were in Eastern Europe and dealing with oppression,
p355
aVwe wanted all kinds of things,
p356
aVbut mostly what we needed was hope,
p357
aVan orientation of the spirit,
p358
aVa willingness to sometimes be in hopeless places
p359
aVand be a witness."
p360
aa(lp361
VWell that orientation of the spirit
p362
aVis very much at the core of what I believe
p363
aVeven TED communities
p364
aVhave to be engaged in.
p365
aVThere is no disconnect
p366
aVaround technology and design
p367
aVthat will allow us to be fully human
p368
aVuntil we pay attention to suffering,
p369
aVto poverty, to exclusion, to unfairness, to injustice.
p370
aVNow I will warn you
p371
aVthat this kind of identity
p372
aVis a much more challenging identity
p373
aVthan ones that don't pay attention to this.
p374
aVIt will get to you.
p375
aa(lp376
VI had the great privilege, when I was a young lawyer, of meeting Rosa Parks.
p377
aVAnd Ms. Parks used to come back to Montgomery every now and then,
p378
aVand she would get together with two of her dearest friends,
p379
aVthese older women,
p380
aVJohnnie Carr who was the organizer
p381
aVof the Montgomery bus boycott \u2014
p382
aVamazing African-American woman \u2014
p383
aVand Virginia Durr, a white woman,
p384
aVwhose husband, Clifford Durr, represented Dr. King.
p385
aVAnd these women would get together and just talk.
p386
aa(lp387
VAnd every now and then Ms. Carr would call me,
p388
aVand she'd say, "Bryan, Ms. Parks is coming to town. We're going to get together and talk.
p389
aVDo you want to come over and listen?"
p390
aVAnd I'd say, "Yes, Ma'am, I do."
p391
aVAnd she'd say, "Well what are you going to do when you get here?"
p392
aVI said, "I'm going to listen."
p393
aVAnd I'd go over there and I would, I would just listen.
p394
aVIt would be so energizing and so empowering.
p395
aa(lp396
VAnd one time I was over there listening to these women talk,
p397
aVand after a couple of hours Ms. Parks turned to me
p398
aVand she said, "Now Bryan, tell me what the Equal Justice Initiative is.
p399
aVTell me what you're trying to do."
p400
aVAnd I began giving her my rap.
p401
aVI said, "Well we're trying to challenge injustice.
p402
aVWe're trying to help people who have been wrongly convicted.
p403
aVWe're trying to confront bias and discrimination
p404
aVin the administration of criminal justice.
p405
aVWe're trying to end life without parole sentences for children.
p406
aVWe're trying to do something about the death penalty.
p407
aVWe're trying to reduce the prison population.
p408
aVWe're trying to end mass incarceration."
p409
aa(lp410
VI gave her my whole rap, and when I finished she looked at me
p411
aVand she said, "Mmm mmm mmm."
p412
aVShe said, "That's going to make you tired, tired, tired."
p413
aV(Laughter)
p414
aVAnd that's when Ms. Carr leaned forward, she put her finger in my face,
p415
aVshe said, "That's why you've got to be brave, brave, brave."
p416
aa(lp417
VAnd I actually believe that the TED community
p418
aVneeds to be more courageous.
p419
aVWe need to find ways
p420
aVto embrace these challenges,
p421
aVthese problems, the suffering.
p422
aVBecause ultimately, our humanity depends
p423
aVon everyone's humanity.
p424
aVI've learned very simple things doing the work that I do.
p425
aVIt's just taught me very simple things.
p426
aVI've come to understand and to believe
p427
aVthat each of us
p428
aVis more than the worst thing we've ever done.
p429
aVI believe that for every person on the planet.
p430
aVI think if somebody tells a lie, they're not just a liar.
p431
aVI think if somebody takes something that doesn't belong to them,
p432
aVthey're not just a thief.
p433
aVI think even if you kill someone, you're not just a killer.
p434
aVAnd because of that there's this basic human dignity
p435
aVthat must be respected by law.
p436
aVI also believe
p437
aVthat in many parts of this country,
p438
aVand certainly in many parts of this globe,
p439
aVthat the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
p440
aVI don't believe that.
p441
aVI actually think, in too many places,
p442
aVthe opposite of poverty is justice.
p443
aa(lp444
VAnd finally, I believe
p445
aVthat, despite the fact that it is so dramatic
p446
aVand so beautiful and so inspiring
p447
aVand so stimulating,
p448
aVwe will ultimately not be judged by our technology,
p449
aVwe won't be judged by our design,
p450
aVwe won't be judged by our intellect and reason.
p451
aVUltimately, you judge the character of a society,
p452
aVnot by how they treat their rich and the powerful and the privileged,
p453
aVbut by how they treat the poor,
p454
aVthe condemned, the incarcerated.
p455
aVBecause it's in that nexus
p456
aVthat we actually begin to understand truly profound things
p457
aVabout who we are.
p458
aa(lp459
VI sometimes get out of balance. I'll end with this story.
p460
aVI sometimes push too hard.
p461
aVI do get tired, as we all do.
p462
aVSometimes those ideas get ahead of our thinking
p463
aVin ways that are important.
p464
aVAnd I've been representing these kids
p465
aVwho have been sentenced to do these very harsh sentences.
p466
aVAnd I go to the jail and I see my client who's 13 and 14,
p467
aVand he's been certified to stand trial as an adult.
p468
aVI start thinking, well, how did that happen?
p469
aVHow can a judge turn you into something
p470
aVthat you're not?
p471
aVAnd the judge has certified him as an adult, but I see this kid.
p472
aa(lp473
VAnd I was up too late one night and I starting thinking,
p474
aVwell gosh, if the judge can turn you into something that you're not,
p475
aVthe judge must have magic power.
p476
aVYeah, Bryan, the judge has some magic power.
p477
aVYou should ask for some of that.
p478
aVAnd because I was up too late, wasn't thinking real straight,
p479
aVI started working on a motion.
p480
aVAnd I had a client who was 14 years old, a young, poor black kid.
p481
aVAnd I started working on this motion,
p482
aVand the head of the motion was: "Motion to try my poor,
p483
aV14-year-old black male client
p484
aVlike a privileged, white 75-year-old
p485
aVcorporate executive."
p486
aa(lp487
V(Applause)
p488
aa(lp489
VAnd I put in my motion
p490
aVthat there was prosecutorial misconduct and police misconduct and judicial misconduct.
p491
aVThere was a crazy line in there about how there's no conduct in this county,
p492
aVit's all misconduct.
p493
aVAnd the next morning, I woke up and I thought, now did I dream that crazy motion,
p494
aVor did I actually write it?
p495
aVAnd to my horror, not only had I written it,
p496
aVbut I had sent it to court.
p497
aa(lp498
V(Applause)
p499
aa(lp500
VA couple months went by,
p501
aVand I had just forgotten all about it.
p502
aVAnd I finally decided,
p503
aVoh gosh, I've got to go to the court and do this crazy case.
p504
aVAnd I got into my car
p505
aVand I was feeling really overwhelmed \u2014 overwhelmed.
p506
aVAnd I got in my car and I went to this courthouse.
p507
aVAnd I was thinking, this is going to be so difficult, so painful.
p508
aVAnd I finally got out of the car and I started walking up to the courthouse.
p509
aa(lp510
VAnd as I was walking up the steps of this courthouse,
p511
aVthere was an older black man who was the janitor in this courthouse.
p512
aVWhen this man saw me, he came over to me
p513
aVand he said, "Who are you?"
p514
aVI said, "I'm a lawyer." He said, "You're a lawyer?" I said, "Yes, sir."
p515
aVAnd this man came over to me
p516
aVand he hugged me.
p517
aVAnd he whispered in my ear.
p518
aVHe said, "I'm so proud of you."
p519
aVAnd I have to tell you,
p520
aVit was energizing.
p521
aVIt connected deeply with something in me
p522
aVabout identity,
p523
aVabout the capacity of every person to contribute
p524
aVto a community, to a perspective that is hopeful.
p525
aa(lp526
VWell I went into the courtroom.
p527
aVAnd as soon as I walked inside, the judge saw me coming in.
p528
aVHe said, "Mr. Stevenson, did you write this crazy motion?"
p529
aVI said, "Yes, sir. I did." And we started arguing.
p530
aVAnd people started coming in because they were just outraged.
p531
aVI had written these crazy things.
p532
aVAnd police officers were coming in
p533
aVand assistant prosecutors and clerk workers.
p534
aVAnd before I knew it, the courtroom was filled with people
p535
aVangry that we were talking about race,
p536
aVthat we were talking about poverty,
p537
aVthat we were talking about inequality.
p538
aa(lp539
VAnd out of the corner of my eye, I could see this janitor pacing back and forth.
p540
aVAnd he kept looking through the window, and he could hear all of this holler.
p541
aVHe kept pacing back and forth.
p542
aVAnd finally, this older black man with this very worried look on his face
p543
aVcame into the courtroom and sat down behind me,
p544
aValmost at counsel table.
p545
aVAbout 10 minutes later the judge said we would take a break.
p546
aVAnd during the break there was a deputy sheriff who was offended
p547
aVthat the janitor had come into court.
p548
aVAnd this deputy jumped up and he ran over to this older black man.
p549
aVHe said, "Jimmy, what are you doing in this courtroom?"
p550
aVAnd this older black man stood up
p551
aVand he looked at that deputy and he looked at me
p552
aVand he said, "I came into this courtroom
p553
aVto tell this young man,
p554
aVkeep your eyes on the prize, hold on."
p555
aa(lp556
VI've come to TED
p557
aVbecause I believe that many of you understand
p558
aVthat the moral arc of the universe is long,
p559
aVbut it bends toward justice.
p560
aVThat we cannot be full evolved human beings
p561
aVuntil we care about human rights and basic dignity.
p562
aVThat all of our survival
p563
aVis tied to the survival of everyone.
p564
aVThat our visions of technology and design
p565
aVand entertainment and creativity
p566
aVhave to be married with visions
p567
aVof humanity, compassion and justice.
p568
aVAnd more than anything,
p569
aVfor those of you who share that,
p570
aVI've simply come to tell you
p571
aVto keep your eyes on the prize, hold on.
p572
aa(lp573
VThank you very much.
p574
aa(lp575
V(Applause)
p576
aa(lp577
VChris Anderson: So you heard and saw
p578
aVan obvious desire by this audience, this community,
p579
aVto help you on your way and to do something on this issue.
p580
aVOther than writing a check,
p581
aVwhat could we do?
p582
aa(lp583
VBS: Well there are opportunities all around us.
p584
aVIf you live in the state of California, for example,
p585
aVthere's a referendum coming up this spring
p586
aVwhere actually there's going to be an effort
p587
aVto redirect some of the money we spend on the politics of punishment.
p588
aVFor example, here in California
p589
aVwe're going to spend one billion dollars
p590
aVon the death penalty in the next five years \u2014
p591
aVone billion dollars.
p592
aVAnd yet, 46 percent of all homicide cases
p593
aVdon't result in arrest.
p594
aV56 percent of all rape cases don't result.
p595
aVSo there's an opportunity to change that.
p596
aVAnd this referendum would propose having those dollars
p597
aVgo to law enforcement and safety.
p598
aVAnd I think that opportunity exists all around us.
p599
aa(lp600
VCA: There's been this huge decline
p601
aVin crime in America over the last three decades.
p602
aVAnd part of the narrative of that
p603
aVis sometimes that it's about increased incarceration rates.
p604
aVWhat would you say to someone who believed that?
p605
aa(lp606
VBS: Well actually the violent crime rate
p607
aVhas remained relatively stable.
p608
aVThe great increase in mass incarceration in this country
p609
aVwasn't really in violent crime categories.
p610
aVIt was this misguided war on drugs.
p611
aVThat's where the dramatic increases have come
p612
aVin our prison population.
p613
aVAnd we got carried away with the rhetoric of punishment.
p614
aVAnd so we have three strikes laws
p615
aVthat put people in prison forever
p616
aVfor stealing a bicycle, for low-level property crimes,
p617
aVrather than making them give those resources back
p618
aVto the people who they victimized.
p619
aVI believe we need to do more to help people who are victimized by crime,
p620
aVnot do less.
p621
aVAnd I think our current punishment philosophy
p622
aVdoes nothing for no one.
p623
aVAnd I think that's the orientation that we have to change.
p624
aa(lp625
V(Applause)
p626
aa(lp627
VCA: Bryan, you've struck a massive chord here.
p628
