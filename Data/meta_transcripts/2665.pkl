VSo earlier this year,
p4
aVI was informed that I would be doing a TED Talk.
p5
aVSo I was excited, then I panicked,
p6
aVthen I was excited, then I panicked,
p7
aVand in between the excitement and the panicking,
p8
aVI started to do my research,
p9
aVand my research primarily consisted of Googling how to give a great TED Talk.
p10
aa(lp11
V(Laughter)
p12
aa(lp13
VAnd interspersed with that,
p14
aVI was Googling Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.
p15
aVHow many of you know who that is?
p16
aa(lp17
V(Cheers)
p18
aa(lp19
VSo I was Googling her because I always Google her
p20
aVbecause I'm just a fan,
p21
aVbut also because she always has important and interesting things to say.
p22
aVAnd the combination of those searches
p23
aVkept leading me to her talk
p24
aVon the dangers of a single story,
p25
aVon what happens when we have a solitary lens
p26
aVthrough which to understand certain groups of people,
p27
aVand it is the perfect talk.
p28
aVIt's the talk that I would have given if I had been famous first.
p29
aa(lp30
V(Laughter)
p31
aa(lp32
VYou know, and you know, like, she's African and I'm African,
p33
aVand she's a feminist and I'm a feminist,
p34
aVand she's a storyteller and I'm a storyteller,
p35
aVso I really felt like it's my talk.
p36
aa(lp37
V(Laughter)
p38
aa(lp39
VSo I decided that I was going to learn how to code,
p40
aVand then I was going to hack the internet
p41
aVand I would take down all the copies of that talk that existed,
p42
aVand then I would memorize it,
p43
aVand then I would come here and deliver it as if it was my own speech.
p44
aVSo that plan was going really well, except the coding part,
p45
aVand then one morning a few months ago,
p46
aVI woke up
p47
aVto the news that the wife of a certain presidential candidate
p48
aVhad given a speech that \u2014
p49
aa(lp50
V(Laughter)
p51
aa(lp52
V(Applause)
p53
aa(lp54
Vthat sounded eerily like a speech given by one of my other faves,
p55
aVMichelle Obama.
p56
aa(lp57
V(Cheers)
p58
aa(lp59
VAnd so I decided that I should probably write my own TED Talk,
p60
aVand so that is what I am here to do.
p61
aVI'm here to talk about my own observations about storytelling.
p62
aVI want to talk to you about the power of stories, of course,
p63
aVbut I also want to talk about their limitations,
p64
aVparticularly for those of us who are interested in social justice.
p65
aa(lp66
VSo since Adichie gave that talk seven years ago,
p67
aVthere has been a boom in storytelling.
p68
aVStories are everywhere,
p69
aVand if there was a danger in the telling of one tired old tale,
p70
aVthen I think there has got to be lots to celebrate about the flourishing
p71
aVof so many stories and so many voices.
p72
aVStories are the antidote to bias.
p73
aVIn fact, today, if you are middle class and connected via the internet,
p74
aVyou can download stories at the touch of a button
p75
aVor the swipe of a screen.
p76
aVYou can listen to a podcast
p77
aVabout what it's like to grow up Dalit in Kolkata.
p78
aVYou can hear an indigenous man in Australia
p79
aVtalk about the trials and triumphs of raising his children in dignity
p80
aVand in pride.
p81
aVStories make us fall in love.
p82
aVThey heal rifts and they bridge divides.
p83
aVStories can even make it easier for us
p84
aVto talk about the deaths of people in our societies
p85
aVwho don't matter, because they make us care.
p86
aVRight?
p87
aa(lp88
VI'm not so sure,
p89
aVand I actually work for a place called the Centre for Stories.
p90
aVAnd my job is to help to tell stories
p91
aVthat challenge mainstream narratives about what it means to be black
p92
aVor a Muslim or a refugee or any of those other categories
p93
aVthat we talk about all the time.
p94
aVBut I come to this work
p95
aVafter a long history as a social justice activist,
p96
aVand so I'm really interested in the ways
p97
aVthat people talk about nonfiction storytelling
p98
aVas though it's about more than entertainment,
p99
aVas though it's about being a catalyst for social action.
p100
aVIt's not uncommon to hear people say
p101
aVthat stories make the world a better place.
p102
aVIncreasingly, though, I worry that even the most poignant stories,
p103
aVparticularly the stories about people who no one seems to care about,
p104
aVcan often get in the way of action towards social justice.
p105
aVNow, this is not because storytellers mean any harm.
p106
aVQuite the contrary.
p107
aVStorytellers are often do-gooders like me and, I suspect, yourselves.
p108
aVAnd the audiences of storytellers
p109
aVare often deeply compassionate and empathetic people.
p110
aVStill, good intentions can have unintended consequences,
p111
aVand so I want to propose that stories are not as magical as they seem.
p112
aVSo three \u2014 because it's always got to be three \u2014
p113
aVthree reasons why I think
p114
aVthat stories don't necessarily make the world a better place.
p115
aa(lp116
VFirstly, stories can create an illusion of solidarity.
p117
aVThere is nothing like that feel-good factor you get
p118
aVfrom listening to a fantastic story
p119
aVwhere you feel like you climbed that mountain, right,
p120
aVor that you befriended that death row inmate.
p121
aVBut you didn't.
p122
aVYou haven't done anything.
p123
aVListening is an important
p124
aVbut insufficient step towards social action.
p125
aa(lp126
VSecondly, I think often we are drawn
p127
aVtowards characters and protagonists
p128
aVwho are likable and human.
p129
aVAnd this makes sense, of course, right?
p130
aVBecause if you like someone, then you care about them.
p131
aVBut the inverse is also true.
p132
aVIf you don't like someone,
p133
aVthen you don't care about them.
p134
aVAnd if you don't care about them,
p135
aVyou don't have to see yourself as having a moral obligation
p136
aVto think about the circumstances that shaped their lives.
p137
aa(lp138
VI learned this lesson when I was 14 years old.
p139
aVI learned that actually, you don't have to like someone
p140
aVto recognize their wisdom,
p141
aVand you certainly don't have to like someone
p142
aVto take a stand by their side.
p143
aVSo my bike was stolen
p144
aVwhile I was riding it \u2014
p145
aa(lp146
V(Laughter)
p147
aa(lp148
Vwhich is possible if you're riding slowly enough, which I was.
p149
aa(lp150
V(Laughter)
p151
aa(lp152
VSo one minute I'm cutting across this field
p153
aVin the Nairobi neighborhood where I grew up,
p154
aVand it's like a very bumpy path,
p155
aVand so when you're riding a bike,
p156
aVyou don't want to be like, you know \u2014
p157
aa(lp158
V(Laughter)
p159
aa(lp160
VAnd so I'm going like this, slowly pedaling,
p161
aVand all of a sudden, I'm on the floor.
p162
aVI'm on the ground, and I look up,
p163
aVand there's this kid peddling away in the getaway vehicle,
p164
aVwhich is my bike,
p165
aVand he's about 11 or 12 years old, and I'm on the floor,
p166
aVand I'm crying because I saved a lot of money for that bike,
p167
aVand I'm crying and I stand up and I start screaming.
p168
aVInstinct steps in, and I start screaming, "Mwizi, mwizi!"
p169
aVwhich means "thief" in Swahili.
p170
aVAnd out of the woodworks, all of these people come out
p171
aVand they start to give chase.
p172
aVThis is Africa, so mob justice in action.
p173
aVRight?
p174
aVAnd I round the corner, and they've captured him,
p175
aVthey've caught him.
p176
aVThe suspect has been apprehended,
p177
aVand they make him give me my bike back,
p178
aVand they also make him apologize.
p179
aVAgain, you know, typical African justice, right?
p180
aVAnd so they make him say sorry.
p181
aVAnd so we stand there facing each other,
p182
aVand he looks at me, and he says sorry,
p183
aVbut he looks at me with this unbridled fury.
p184
aVHe is very, very angry.
p185
aVAnd it is the first time that I have been confronted with someone
p186
aVwho doesn't like me simply because of what I represent.
p187
aVHe looks at me with this look as if to say,
p188
aV"You, with your shiny skin and your bike, you're angry at me?"
p189
aa(lp190
VSo it was a hard lesson that he didn't like me,
p191
aVbut you know what, he was right.
p192
aVI was a middle-class kid living in a poor country.
p193
aVI had a bike, and he barely had food.
p194
aVSometimes, it's the messages that we don't want to hear,
p195
aVthe ones that make us want to crawl out of ourselves,
p196
aVthat we need to hear the most.
p197
aVFor every lovable storyteller who steals your heart,
p198
aVthere are hundreds more whose voices are slurred and ragged,
p199
aVwho don't get to stand up on a stage dressed in fine clothes like this.
p200
aVThere are a million angry-boy-on-a-bike stories
p201
aVand we can't afford to ignore them
p202
aVsimply because we don't like their protagonists
p203
aVor because that's not the kid that we would bring home with us
p204
aVfrom the orphanage.
p205
aa(lp206
VThe third reason that I think
p207
aVthat stories don't necessarily make the world a better place
p208
aVis that too often we are so invested in the personal narrative
p209
aVthat we forget to look at the bigger picture.
p210
aVAnd so we applaud someone
p211
aVwhen they tell us about their feelings of shame,
p212
aVbut we don't necessarily link that to oppression.
p213
aVWe nod understandingly when someone says they felt small,
p214
aVbut we don't link that to discrimination.
p215
aVThe most important stories, especially for social justice,
p216
aVare those that do both,
p217
aVthat are both personal and allow us to explore and understand the political.
p218
aa(lp219
VBut it's not just about the stories we like
p220
aVversus the stories we choose to ignore.
p221
aVIncreasingly, we are living in a society where there are larger forces at play,
p222
aVwhere stories are actually for many people beginning to replace the news.
p223
aVYeah?
p224
aVWe live in a time where we are witnessing the decline of facts,
p225
aVwhen emotions rule
p226
aVand analysis, it's kind of boring, right?
p227
aVWhere we value what we feel more than what we actually know.
p228
aVA recent report by the Pew Center on trends in America
p229
aVindicates that only 10 percent of young adults under the age of 30
p230
aV"place a lot of trust in the media."
p231
aVNow, this is significant.
p232
aVIt means that storytellers are gaining trust
p233
aVat precisely the same moment
p234
aVthat many in the media are losing the confidence in the public.
p235
aVThis is not a good thing,
p236
aVbecause while stories are important
p237
aVand they help us to have insights in many ways,
p238
aVwe need the media.
p239
aVFrom my years as a social justice activist,
p240
aVI know very well that we need credible facts from media institutions
p241
aVcombined with the powerful voices of storytellers.
p242
aVThat's what pushes the needle forward in terms of social justice.
p243
aa(lp244
VIn the final analysis, of course,
p245
aVit is justice
p246
aVthat makes the world a better place,
p247
aVnot stories. Right?
p248
aVAnd so if it is justice that we are after,
p249
aVthen I think we mustn't focus on the media or on storytellers.
p250
aVWe must focus on audiences,
p251
aVon anyone who has ever turned on a radio
p252
aVor listened to a podcast,
p253
aVand that means all of us.
p254
aa(lp255
VSo a few concluding thoughts
p256
aVon what audiences can do to make the world a better place.
p257
aVSo firstly, the world would be a better place, I think,
p258
aVif audiences were more curious and more skeptical
p259
aVand asked more questions about the social context
p260
aVthat created those stories that they love so much.
p261
aVSecondly, the world would be a better place
p262
aVif audiences recognized that storytelling is intellectual work.
p263
aVAnd I think it would be important for audiences
p264
aVto demand more buttons on their favorite websites,
p265
aVbuttons for example that say,
p266
aV"If you liked this story,
p267
aVclick here to support a cause your storyteller believes in."
p268
aVOr "click here to contribute to your storyteller's next big idea."
p269
aVOften, we are committed to the platforms,
p270
aVbut not necessarily to the storytellers themselves.
p271
aVAnd then lastly, I think that audiences can make the world a better place
p272
aVby switching off their phones,
p273
aVby stepping away from their screens
p274
aVand stepping out into the real world beyond what feels safe.
p275
aa(lp276
VAlice Walker has said,
p277
aV"Look closely at the present you are constructing.
p278
aVIt should look like the future you are dreaming."
p279
aVStorytellers can help us to dream,
p280
aVbut it's up to all of us to have a plan for justice.
p281
aa(lp282
VThank you.
