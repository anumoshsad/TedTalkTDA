VI'd like to share with you
p4
aVthe story of one of my patients called Celine.
p5
aa(lp6
VCeline is a housewife and lives in a rural district
p7
aVof Cameroon in west Central Africa.
p8
aVSix years ago, at the time of her HIV diagnosis,
p9
aVshe was recruited to participate in the clinical trial
p10
aVwhich was running in her health district at the time.
p11
aVWhen I first met Celine, a little over a year ago,
p12
aVshe had gone for 18 months
p13
aVwithout any antiretroviral therapy,
p14
aVand she was very ill.
p15
aVShe told me that she stopped coming to the clinic
p16
aVwhen the trial ended
p17
aVbecause she had no money for the bus fare
p18
aVand was too ill to walk the 35-kilometer distance.
p19
aVNow during the clinical trial,
p20
aVshe'd been given all her antiretroviral drugs free of charge,
p21
aVand her transportation costs
p22
aVhad been covered by the research funds.
p23
aVAll of these ended once the trial was completed,
p24
aVleaving Celine with no alternatives.
p25
aVShe was unable to tell me the names of the drugs
p26
aVshe'd received during the trial,
p27
aVor even what the trial had been about.
p28
aVI didn't bother to ask her what the results of the trial were
p29
aVbecause it seemed obvious to me that she would have no clue.
p30
aVYet what puzzled me most
p31
aVwas Celine had given her informed consent
p32
aVto be a part of this trial, yet she clearly did not understand
p33
aVthe implications of being a participant
p34
aVor what would happen to her once the trial had been completed.
p35
aa(lp36
VNow, I have shared this story with you as an example
p37
aVof what can happen to participants in the clinical trial
p38
aVwhen it is poorly conducted.
p39
aVMaybe this particular trial yielded exciting results.
p40
aVMaybe it even got published in a high-profile scientific journal.
p41
aVMaybe it would inform clinicians around the world
p42
aVon how to improve on the clinical management of HIV patients.
p43
aVBut it would have done so at a price
p44
aVto hundreds of patients who, like Celine,
p45
aVwere left to their own devices
p46
aVonce the research had been completed.
p47
aa(lp48
VI do not stand here today to suggest in any way
p49
aVthat conducting HIV clinical trials
p50
aVin developing countries is bad.
p51
aVOn the contrary, clinical trials are extremely useful tools,
p52
aVand are much needed to address the burden
p53
aVof disease in developing countries.
p54
aVHowever, the inequalities that exist between
p55
aVricher countries and developing countries in terms of funding
p56
aVpose a real risk for exploitation,
p57
aVespecially in the context of externally-funded research.
p58
aVSadly enough, the fact remains that
p59
aVa lot of the studies that are conducted in developing countries
p60
aVcould never be authorized in the richer countries
p61
aVwhich fund the research.
p62
aa(lp63
VI'm sure you must be asking yourselves
p64
aVwhat makes developing countries,
p65
aVespecially those in sub-Saharan Africa,
p66
aVso attractive for these HIV clinical trials?
p67
aVWell, in order for a clinical trial to generate
p68
aVvalid and widely applicable results,
p69
aVthey need to be conducted with large numbers of study participants
p70
aVand preferably on a population
p71
aVwith a high incidence of new HIV infections.
p72
aVSub-Saharan Africa largely fits this description,
p73
aVwith 22 million people living with HIV,
p74
aVan estimated 70 percent of the 30 million people
p75
aVwho are infected worldwide.
p76
aVAlso, research within the continent
p77
aVis a lot easier to conduct due to widespread poverty,
p78
aVendemic diseases and inadequate health care systems.
p79
aVA clinical trial that is considered to be
p80
aVpotentially beneficial to the population
p81
aVis more likely to be authorized,
p82
aVand in the absence of good health care systems,
p83
aValmost any offer of medical assistance
p84
aVis accepted as better than nothing.
p85
aVEven more problematic reasons include
p86
aVlower risk of litigation,
p87
aVless rigorous ethical reviews,
p88
aVand populations that are willing to participate
p89
aVin almost any study that hints at a cure.
p90
aVAs funding for HIV research
p91
aVincreases in developing countries
p92
aVand ethical review in richer countries become more strict,
p93
aVyou can see why this context becomes
p94
aVvery, very attractive.
p95
aa(lp96
VThe high prevalence of HIV drives researchers
p97
aVto conduct research that is sometimes scientifically acceptable
p98
aVbut on many levels ethically questionable.
p99
aVHow then can we ensure that, in our search for the cure,
p100
aVwe do not take an unfair advantage
p101
aVof those who are already most affected by the pandemic?
p102
aVI invite you to consider four areas I think we can focus on
p103
aVin order to improve the way in which things are done.
p104
aa(lp105
VThe first of these is informed consent.
p106
aVNow, in order for a clinical trial to be
p107
aVconsidered ethically acceptable,
p108
aVparticipants must be given the relevant information
p109
aVin a way in which they can understand,
p110
aVand must freely consent to participate in the trial.
p111
aVThis is especially important in developing countries,
p112
aVwhere a lot of participants consent to research
p113
aVbecause they believe it is the only way in which
p114
aVthey can receive medical care or other benefits.
p115
aVConsent procedures that are used in richer countries
p116
aVare often inappropriate or ineffective
p117
aVin a lot of developing countries.
p118
aVFor example, it is counterintuitive to have
p119
aVan illiterate study participant, like Celine,
p120
aVsign a lengthy consent form that they are unable to read,
p121
aVlet alone understand.
p122
aVLocal communities need to be more involved
p123
aVin establishing the criteria for recruiting participants
p124
aVin clinical trials, as well as the incentives for participation.
p125
aVThe information in these trials
p126
aVneeds to be given to the potential participants
p127
aVin linguistically and culturally acceptable formats.
p128
aa(lp129
VThe second point I would like for you to consider
p130
aVis the standard of care that is provided
p131
aVto participants within any clinical trial.
p132
aVNow, this is subject to a lot of debate and controversy.
p133
aVShould the control group in the clinical trial
p134
aVbe given the best current treatment which is available
p135
aVanywhere in the world?
p136
aVOr should they be given an alternative standard of care,
p137
aVsuch as the best current treatment available
p138
aVin the country in which the research is being conducted?
p139
aVIs it fair to evaluate a treatment regimen
p140
aVwhich may not be affordable or accessible
p141
aVto the study participants once the research has been completed?
p142
aVNow, in a situation where the best current treatment
p143
aVis inexpensive and simple to deliver,
p144
aVthe answer is straightforward.
p145
aVHowever, the best current treatment available
p146
aVanywhere in the world is often very difficult
p147
aVto provide in developing countries.
p148
aVIt is important to assess the potential risks and benefits
p149
aVof the standard of care which is to be provided
p150
aVto participants in any clinical trial,
p151
aVand establish one which is relevant for the context of the study
p152
aVand most beneficial for the participants within the study.
p153
aa(lp154
VThat brings us to the third point I want you think about:
p155
aVthe ethical review of research.
p156
aVAn effective system for reviewing the ethical suitability
p157
aVof clinical trials is primordial to safeguard participants
p158
aVwithin any clinical trial.
p159
aVUnfortunately, this is often lacking
p160
aVor inefficient in a lot of developing countries.
p161
aVLocal governments need to set up effective systems
p162
aVfor reviewing the ethical issues around the clinical trials
p163
aVwhich are authorized in different developing countries,
p164
aVand they need to do this by setting up
p165
aVethical review committees that are independent
p166
aVof the government and research sponsors.
p167
aVPublic accountability needs to be promoted
p168
aVthrough transparency and independent review
p169
aVby nongovernmental and international organizations
p170
aVas appropriate.
p171
aa(lp172
VThe final point I would like for you to consider tonight
p173
aVis what happens to participants in the clinical trial
p174
aVonce the research has been completed.
p175
aVI think it is absolutely wrong for research to begin
p176
aVin the first place without a clear plan
p177
aVfor what would happen to the participants
p178
aVonce the trial has ended.
p179
aVNow, researchers need to make every effort to ensure that
p180
aVan intervention that has been shown to be beneficial
p181
aVduring a clinical trial
p182
aVis accessible to the participants of the trial
p183
aVonce the trial has been completed.
p184
aVIn addition, they should be able to consider the possibility
p185
aVof introducing and maintaining effective treatments
p186
aVin the wider community once the trial ends.
p187
aVIf, for any reason, they feel that this might not be possible,
p188
aVthen I think they should have to ethically justify
p189
aVwhy the clinical trial should be conducted in the first place.
p190
aa(lp191
VNow, fortunately for Celine,
p192
aVour meeting did not end in my office.
p193
aVI was able to get her enrolled into a free HIV treatment program
p194
aVcloser to her home,
p195
aVand with a support group to help her cope.
p196
aVHer story has a positive ending,
p197
aVbut there are thousands of others in similar situations
p198
aVwho are much less fortunate.
p199
aa(lp200
VAlthough she may not know this,
p201
aVmy encounter with Celine has completely changed the way
p202
aVin which I view HIV clinical trials in developing countries,
p203
aVand made me even more determined to be part of the movement
p204
aVto change the way in which things are done.
p205
aa(lp206
VI believe that every single person
p207
aVlistening to me tonight can be part of that change.
p208
aVIf you are a researcher, I hold you
p209
aVto a higher standard of moral conscience,
p210
aVto remain ethical in your research,
p211
aVand not compromise human welfare in your search for answers.
p212
aVIf you work for a funding agency or pharmaceutical company,
p213
aVI challenge you to hold your employers
p214
aVto fund research that is ethically sound.
p215
aVIf you come from a developing country like myself,
p216
aVI urge you to hold your government
p217
aVto a more thorough review of the clinical trials
p218
aVwhich are authorized in your country.
p219
aVYes, there is a need for us to find a cure for HIV,
p220
aVto find an effective vaccine for malaria,
p221
aVto find a diagnostic tool that works for T.B.,
p222
aVbut I believe that we owe it to those who willingly
p223
aVand selflessly consent to participate in these clinical trials
p224
aVto do this in a humane way.
p225
aa(lp226
VThank you.
