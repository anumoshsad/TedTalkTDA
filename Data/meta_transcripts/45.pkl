VHi, everyone. I'm Sirena.
p12
aVI'm 11 years old and from Connecticut.
p13
aV(Audience cheers)

p16
aa(lp17
VWell, I'm not really sure why I'm here.

V(Laughter)
p20
aa(lp21
VI mean, what does this have to do with technology, entertainment and design?
p22
aVWell, I count my iPod, cellphone and computer as technology,
p23
aVbut this has nothing to do with that.
p24
aa(lp25
VSo I did a little research on it.
p26
aVWell, this is what I found.
p27
aVOf course, I hope I can memorize it.
p28

aa(lp31
VThe violin is made of a wood box and four metal strings.
p32
aVBy pulling a string, it vibrates and produces a sound wave,
p33
aVwhich passes through a piece of wood called a bridge,
p34
aVand goes down to the wood box and gets amplified, but ... let me think.
p35
aa(lp36
V(Laughter)
p37
aa(lp38
VPlacing your finger at different places on the fingerboard
p39
aVchanges the string length, and that changes the frequency of the sound wave.
p40
aV(Sighs) Oh, my gosh!
p41
aa(lp42
V(Laughter)
p43
aa(lp44
VOK, this is sort of technology,
p45
aVbut I can call it a 16th-century technology.
p46
aVBut actually, the most fascinating thing that I found
p47
aVwas that even the audio system or wave transmission nowadays
p48
aVare still based on the same principle of producing and projecting sound.
p49
aVIsn't that cool?
p50
aa(lp51
V(Laughter)

aa(lp53
V(Applause)
p54
aa(lp55
VDesign \u2014 I love its design.
p56
aVI remember when I was little, my mom asked me,
p57
aV"Would you like to play the violin or the piano?"
p58
aVI looked at that giant monster and said to myself \u2014
p59
aV"I am not going to lock myself on that bench the whole day!"
p60
aa(lp61
V(Laughter)
p62
aa(lp63
VThis is small and lightweight.
p64
aVI can play from standing, sitting or walking.
p65
aVAnd, you know what?
p66
aVThe best of all is that if I don't want to practice,
p67
aV(Whispering) I can hide it.
p68
aa(lp69
V(Laughter)
p70
aa(lp71
VThe violin is very beautiful.
p72
aVSome people relate it as the shape of a lady.
p73
aVBut whether you like it or not, it's been so for more than 400 years,
p74
aVunlike modern stuff [that] easily looks dated.
p75
aVBut I think it's very personal and unique that,
p76
aValthough each violin looks pretty similar,
p77
aVno two violins sound the same \u2014
p78
aVeven from the same maker or based on the same model.
p79
aa(lp80
VEntertainment \u2014 I love the entertainment.
p81
aVBut actually, the instrument itself isn't very entertaining.
p82
aVI mean, when I first got my violin and tried to play around on it,
p83
aVit was actually really bad,
p84
aVbecause it didn't sound the way I'd heard from other kids \u2014
p85
aVit was so horrible and so scratchy.
p86
aVSo, it wasn't entertaining at all.
p87
aVBut besides, my brother found this very funny:
p88
aVYuk! Yuk! Yuk!
p89
aa(lp90
V(Laughter)
p91
aa(lp92
VA few years later, I heard a joke
p93
aVabout the greatest violinist, Jascha Heifetz.
p94
aVAfter Mr. Heifetz's concert,
p95
aVa lady came over and complimented him:
p96
aV"Oh, Mr. Heifetz, your violin sounded so great tonight!"
p97
aVAnd Mr. Heifetz was a very cool person,
p98
aVso he picked up his violin and said,
p99
aV"Funny \u2014 I don't hear anything."
p100
aa(lp101
V(Laughter)
p102
aa(lp103
VNow I realize that as the musician,
p104
aVwe human beings, with our great mind, artistic heart and skill,
p105
aVcan change this 16th-century technology and a legendary design
p106
aVto a wonderful entertainment.
p107
aVNow I know why I'm here.

VAt first, I thought I was just going to be here to perform,
p116
aVbut unexpectedly, I learned and enjoyed much more.
p117
aVBut ... although some of the talks were quite up there for me.
p118
aa(lp119
V(Laughter)
p120
aa(lp121
VLike the multi-dimension stuff.
p122
aVI mean, honestly, I'd be happy enough
p123
aVif I could actually get my two dimensions correct in school.
p124
aa(lp125
V(Laughter)
p126
aa(lp127
VBut actually, the most impressive thing to me is that \u2014
p128
aVwell, actually, I would also like to say this for all children
p129
aVis to say thank you to all adults, for actually caring for us a lot,
p130
aVand to make our future world much better.
p131
aVThank you.
