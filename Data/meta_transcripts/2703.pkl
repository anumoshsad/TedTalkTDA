VI was a blue-eyed, chubby-cheeked five-year-old
p4
aVwhen I joined my family on the picket line for the first time.
p5
aVMy mom made me leave my dolls in the minivan.
p6
aVI'd stand on a street corner in the heavy Kansas humidity,
p7
aVsurrounded by a few dozen relatives,
p8
aVwith my tiny fists clutching a sign that I couldn't read yet:
p9
aV"Gays are worthy of death."
p10
aVThis was the beginning.
p11
aa(lp12
VOur protests soon became a daily occurrence
p13
aVand an international phenomenon,
p14
aVand as a member of Westboro Baptist Church,
p15
aVI became a fixture on picket lines across the country.
p16
aVThe end of my antigay picketing career
p17
aVand life as I knew it,
p18
aVcame 20 years later,
p19
aVtriggered in part by strangers on Twitter
p20
aVwho showed me the power of engaging the other.
p21
aa(lp22
VIn my home,
p23
aVlife was framed as an epic spiritual battle between good and evil.
p24
aVThe good was my church and its members,
p25
aVand the evil was everyone else.
p26
aVMy church's antics were such
p27
aVthat we were constantly at odds with the world,
p28
aVand that reinforced our otherness on a daily basis.
p29
aV"Make a difference between the unclean and the clean,"
p30
aVthe verse says,
p31
aVand so we did.
p32
aVFrom baseball games to military funerals,
p33
aVwe trekked across the country with neon protest signs in hand
p34
aVto tell others exactly how "unclean" they were
p35
aVand exactly why they were headed for damnation.
p36
aVThis was the focus of our whole lives.
p37
aVThis was the only way for me to do good in a world that sits in Satan's lap.
p38
aVAnd like the rest of my 10 siblings,
p39
aVI believed what I was taught with all my heart,
p40
aVand I pursued Westboro's agenda with a special sort of zeal.
p41
aa(lp42
VIn 2009, that zeal brought me to Twitter.
p43
aVInitially, the people I encountered on the platform
p44
aVwere just as hostile as I expected.
p45
aVThey were the digital version of the screaming hordes
p46
aVI'd been seeing at protests since I was a kid.
p47
aVBut in the midst of that digital brawl,
p48
aVa strange pattern developed.
p49
aVSomeone would arrive at my profile with the usual rage and scorn,
p50
aVI would respond with a custom mix of Bible verses, pop culture references
p51
aVand smiley faces.
p52
aVThey would be understandably confused and caught off guard,
p53
aVbut then a conversation would ensue.
p54
aVAnd it was civil \u2014
p55
aVfull of genuine curiosity on both sides.
p56
aVHow had the other come to such outrageous conclusions about the world?
p57
aa(lp58
VSometimes the conversation even bled into real life.
p59
aVPeople I'd sparred with on Twitter
p60
aVwould come out to the picket line to see me
p61
aVwhen I protested in their city.
p62
aVA man named David was one such person.
p63
aVHe ran a blog called "Jewlicious,"
p64
aVand after several months of heated but friendly arguments online,
p65
aVhe came out to see me at a picket in New Orleans.
p66
aVHe brought me a Middle Eastern dessert from Jerusalem, where he lives,
p67
aVand I brought him kosher chocolate
p68
aVand held a "God hates Jews" sign.
p69
aa(lp70
V(Laughter)
p71
aa(lp72
VThere was no confusion about our positions,
p73
aVbut the line between friend and foe was becoming blurred.
p74
aVWe'd started to see each other as human beings,
p75
aVand it changed the way we spoke to one another.
p76
aa(lp77
VIt took time,
p78
aVbut eventually these conversations planted seeds of doubt in me.
p79
aVMy friends on Twitter took the time to understand Westboro's doctrines,
p80
aVand in doing so,
p81
aVthey were able to find inconsistencies I'd missed my entire life.
p82
aVWhy did we advocate the death penalty for gays
p83
aVwhen Jesus said, "Let he who is without sin cast the first stone?"
p84
aVHow could we claim to love our neighbor
p85
aVwhile at the same time praying for God to destroy them?
p86
aVThe truth is that the care shown to me by these strangers on the internet
p87
aVwas itself a contradiction.
p88
aVIt was growing evidence
p89
aVthat people on the other side were not the demons I'd been led to believe.
p90
aa(lp91
VThese realizations were life-altering.
p92
aVOnce I saw that we were not the ultimate arbiters of divine truth
p93
aVbut flawed human beings,
p94
aVI couldn't pretend otherwise.
p95
aVI couldn't justify our actions \u2014
p96
aVespecially our cruel practice of protesting funerals
p97
aVand celebrating human tragedy.
p98
aVThese shifts in my perspective
p99
aVcontributed to a larger erosion of trust in my church,
p100
aVand eventually it made it impossible for me to stay.
p101
aa(lp102
VIn spite of overwhelming grief and terror, I left Westboro in 2012.
p103
aVIn those days just after I left,
p104
aVthe instinct to hide was almost paralyzing.
p105
aVI wanted to hide from the judgement of my family,
p106
aVwho I knew would never speak to me again \u2014
p107
aVpeople whose thoughts and opinions had meant everything to me.
p108
aVAnd I wanted to hide from the world I'd rejected for so long \u2014
p109
aVpeople who had no reason at all to give me a second chance
p110
aVafter a lifetime of antagonism.
p111
aVAnd yet, unbelievably,
p112
aVthey did.
p113
aa(lp114
VThe world had access to my past because it was all over the internet \u2014
p115
aVthousands of tweets and hundreds of interviews,
p116
aVeverything from local TV news to "The Howard Stern Show" \u2014
p117
aVbut so many embraced me with open arms anyway.
p118
aVI wrote an apology for the harm I'd caused,
p119
aVbut I also knew that an apology could never undo any of it.
p120
aVAll I could do was try to build a new life
p121
aVand find a way somehow to repair some of the damage.
p122
aVPeople had every reason to doubt my sincerity,
p123
aVbut most of them didn't.
p124
aVAnd \u2014
p125
aVgiven my history,
p126
aVit was more than I could've hoped for \u2014
p127
aVforgiveness and the benefit of the doubt.
p128
aVIt still amazes me.
p129
aa(lp130
VI spent my first year away from home
p131
aVadrift with my younger sister,
p132
aVwho had chosen to leave with me.
p133
aVWe walked into an abyss,
p134
aVbut we were shocked to find the light and a way forward
p135
aVin the same communities we'd targeted for so long.
p136
aVDavid,
p137
aVmy "Jewlicious" friend from Twitter,
p138
aVinvited us to spend time among a Jewish community in Los Angeles.
p139
aVWe slept on couches in the home of a Hasidic rabbi and his wife
p140
aVand their four kids \u2014
p141
aVthe same rabbi that I'd protested three years earlier
p142
aVwith a sign that said, "Your rabbi is a whore."
p143
aVWe spent long hours talking about theology and Judaism and life
p144
aVwhile we washed dishes in their kosher kitchen
p145
aVand chopped vegetables for dinner.
p146
aVThey treated us like family.
p147
aVThey held nothing against us,
p148
aVand again I was astonished.
p149
aa(lp150
VThat period was full of turmoil,
p151
aVbut one part I've returned to often
p152
aVis a surprising realization I had during that time \u2014
p153
aVthat it was a relief and a privilege to let go of the harsh judgments
p154
aVthat instinctively ran through my mind about nearly every person I saw.
p155
aVI realized that now I needed to learn.
p156
aVI needed to listen.
p157
aa(lp158
VThis has been at the front of my mind lately,
p159
aVbecause I can't help but see in our public discourse
p160
aVso many of the same destructive impulses that ruled my former church.
p161
aVWe celebrate tolerance and diversity more than at any other time in memory,
p162
aVand still we grow more and more divided.
p163
aVWe want good things \u2014
p164
aVjustice, equality, freedom, dignity, prosperity \u2014
p165
aVbut the path we've chosen
p166
aVlooks so much like the one I walked away from four years ago.
p167
aVWe've broken the world into us and them,
p168
aVonly emerging from our bunkers long enough
p169
aVto lob rhetorical grenades at the other camp.
p170
aVWe write off half the country as out-of-touch liberal elites
p171
aVor racist misogynist bullies.
p172
aVNo nuance, no complexity, no humanity.
p173
aVEven when someone does call for empathy and understanding for the other side,
p174
aVthe conversation nearly always devolves
p175
aVinto a debate about who deserves more empathy.
p176
aVAnd just as I learned to do,
p177
aVwe routinely refuse to acknowledge the flaws in our positions
p178
aVor the merits in our opponent's.
p179
aVCompromise is anathema.
p180
aVWe even target people on our own side when they dare to question the party line.
p181
aVThis path has brought us cruel, sniping, deepening polarization,
p182
aVand even outbreaks of violence.
p183
aVI remember this path.
p184
aVIt will not take us where we want to go.
p185
aa(lp186
VWhat gives me hope is that we can do something about this.
p187
aVThe good news is that it's simple,
p188
aVand the bad news is that it's hard.
p189
aVWe have to talk and listen to people we disagree with.
p190
aVIt's hard because we often can't fathom
p191
aVhow the other side came to their positions.
p192
aVIt's hard because righteous indignation,
p193
aVthat sense of certainty that ours is the right side,
p194
aVis so seductive.
p195
aVIt's hard because it means extending empathy and compassion
p196
aVto people who show us hostility and contempt.
p197
aVThe impulse to respond in kind is so tempting,
p198
aVbut that isn't who we want to be.
p199
aVWe can resist.
p200
aVAnd I will always be inspired to do so by those people I encountered on Twitter,
p201
aVapparent enemies who became my beloved friends.
p202
aVAnd in the case of one particularly understanding and generous guy,
p203
aVmy husband.
p204
aVThere was nothing special about the way I responded to him.
p205
aVWhat was special was their approach.
p206
aVI thought about it a lot over the past few years
p207
aVand I found four things they did differently
p208
aVthat made real conversation possible.
p209
aVThese four steps were small but powerful,
p210
aVand I do everything I can to employ them in difficult conversations today.
p211
aa(lp212
VThe first is don't assume bad intent.
p213
aVMy friends on Twitter realized
p214
aVthat even when my words were aggressive and offensive,
p215
aVI sincerely believed I was doing the right thing.
p216
aVAssuming ill motives almost instantly cuts us off
p217
aVfrom truly understanding why someone does and believes as they do.
p218
aVWe forget that they're a human being
p219
aVwith a lifetime of experience that shaped their mind,
p220
aVand we get stuck on that first wave of anger,
p221
aVand the conversation has a very hard time ever moving beyond it.
p222
aVBut when we assume good or neutral intent,
p223
aVwe give our minds a much stronger framework for dialogue.
p224
aa(lp225
VThe second is ask questions.
p226
aVWhen we engage people across ideological divides,
p227
aVasking questions helps us map the disconnect
p228
aVbetween our differing points of view.
p229
aVThat's important because we can't present effective arguments
p230
aVif we don't understand where the other side is actually coming from
p231
aVand because it gives them an opportunity to point out flaws in our positions.
p232
aVBut asking questions serves another purpose;
p233
aVit signals to someone that they're being heard.
p234
aVWhen my friends on Twitter stopped accusing
p235
aVand started asking questions,
p236
aVI almost automatically mirrored them.
p237
aVTheir questions gave me room to speak,
p238
aVbut they also gave me permission to ask them questions
p239
aVand to truly hear their responses.
p240
aVIt fundamentally changed the dynamic of our conversation.
p241
aa(lp242
VThe third is stay calm.
p243
aVThis takes practice and patience,
p244
aVbut it's powerful.
p245
aVAt Westboro, I learned not to care how my manner of speaking affected others.
p246
aVI thought my rightness justified my rudeness \u2014
p247
aVharsh tones, raised voices, insults, interruptions \u2014
p248
aVbut that strategy is ultimately counterproductive.
p249
aVDialing up the volume and the snark is natural in stressful situations,
p250
aVbut it tends to bring the conversation to an unsatisfactory, explosive end.
p251
aVWhen my husband was still just an anonymous Twitter acquaintance,
p252
aVour discussions frequently became hard and pointed,
p253
aVbut we always refused to escalate.
p254
aVInstead, he would change the subject.
p255
aVHe would tell a joke or recommend a book
p256
aVor gently excuse himself from the conversation.
p257
aVWe knew the discussion wasn't over,
p258
aVjust paused for a time to bring us back to an even keel.
p259
aVPeople often lament that digital communication makes us less civil,
p260
aVbut this is one advantage that online conversations have over in-person ones.
p261
aVWe have a buffer of time and space
p262
aVbetween us and the people whose ideas we find so frustrating.
p263
aVWe can use that buffer.
p264
aVInstead of lashing out, we can pause, breathe,
p265
aVchange the subject or walk away,
p266
aVand then come back to it when we're ready.
p267
aa(lp268
VAnd finally ...
p269
aVmake the argument.
p270
aVThis might seem obvious,
p271
aVbut one side effect of having strong beliefs
p272
aVis that we sometimes assume
p273
aVthat the value of our position is or should be obvious and self-evident,
p274
aVthat we shouldn't have to defend our positions
p275
aVbecause they're so clearly right and good
p276
aVthat if someone doesn't get it, it's their problem \u2014
p277
aVthat it's not my job to educate them.
p278
aVBut if it were that simple,
p279
aVwe would all see things the same way.
p280
aVAs kind as my friends on Twitter were,
p281
aVif they hadn't actually made their arguments,
p282
aVit would've been so much harder for me to see the world in a different way.
p283
aVWe are all a product of our upbringing,
p284
aVand our beliefs reflect our experiences.
p285
aVWe can't expect others to spontaneously change their own minds.
p286
aVIf we want change,
p287
aVwe have to make the case for it.
p288
aa(lp289
VMy friends on Twitter didn't abandon their beliefs or their principles \u2014
p290
aVonly their scorn.
p291
aVThey channeled their infinitely justifiable offense
p292
aVand came to me with pointed questions tempered with kindness and humor.
p293
aVThey approached me as a human being,
p294
aVand that was more transformative
p295
aVthan two full decades of outrage, disdain and violence.
p296
aVI know that some might not have the time or the energy or the patience
p297
aVfor extensive engagement,
p298
aVbut as difficult as it can be,
p299
aVreaching out to someone we disagree with
p300
aVis an option that is available to all of us.
p301
aVAnd I sincerely believe that we can do hard things,
p302
aVnot just for them but for us and our future.
p303
aVEscalating disgust and intractable conflict
p304
aVare not what we want for ourselves,
p305
aVor our country
p306
aVor our next generation.
p307
aa(lp308
VMy mom said something to me a few weeks before I left Westboro,
p309
aVwhen I was desperately hoping
p310
aVthere was a way I could stay with my family.
p311
aVPeople I have loved with every pulse of my heart
p312
aVsince even before I was that chubby-cheeked five-year-old,
p313
aVstanding on a picket line holding a sign I couldn't read.
p314
aVShe said, "You're just a human being,
p315
aVmy dear, sweet child."
p316
aVShe was asking me to be humble \u2014
p317
aVnot to question but to trust God and my elders.
p318
aVBut to me, she was missing the bigger picture \u2014
p319
aVthat we're all just human beings.
p320
aVThat we should be guided by that most basic fact,
p321
aVand approach one another with generosity and compassion.
p322
aa(lp323
VEach one of us contributes to the communities
p324
aVand the cultures and the societies that we make up.
p325
aVThe end of this spiral of rage and blame begins with one person
p326
aVwho refuses to indulge these destructive, seductive impulses.
p327
aVWe just have to decide that it's going to start with us.
p328
aa(lp329
VThank you.
