VWhen the Industrial Revolution started,
p4
aVthe amount of carbon sitting underneath Britain in the form of coal
p5
aVwas as big as the amount of carbon sitting under Saudi Arabia
p6
aVin the form of oil.
p7
aVThis carbon powered the Industrial Revolution,
p8
aVit put the "Great" in Great Britain,
p9
aVand led to Britain's temporary world domination.
p10
aVAnd then, in 1918, coal production in Britain peaked,
p11
aVand has declined ever since.
p12
aVIn due course, Britain started using oil and gas from the North Sea,
p13
aVand in the year 2000,
p14
aVoil and gas production from the North Sea also peaked,
p15
aVand they're now on the decline.
p16
aa(lp17
VThese observations about the finiteness
p18
aVof easily accessible, local, secure fossil fuels,
p19
aVis a motivation for saying, "Well, what's next?
p20
aVWhat is life after fossil fuels going to be like?
p21
aVShouldn't we be thinking hard about how to get off fossil fuels?"
p22
aVAnother motivation, of course, is climate change.
p23
aa(lp24
VAnd when people talk about life after fossil fuels
p25
aVand climate change action,
p26
aVI think there's a lot of fluff,
p27
aVa lot of greenwash, a lot of misleading advertising,
p28
aVand I feel a duty as a physicist to try to guide people around the claptrap
p29
aVand help people understand the actions that really make a difference,
p30
aVand to focus on ideas that do add up.
p31
aa(lp32
VLet me illustrate this
p33
aVwith what physicists call a back-of-envelope calculation.
p34
aVWe love back-of-envelope calculations.
p35
aVYou ask a question, write down some numbers,
p36
aVand get an answer.
p37
aVIt may not be very accurate, but it may make you say, "Hmm."
p38
aVSo here's a question:
p39
aVImagine if we said, "Oh yes, we can get off fossil fuels.
p40
aVWe'll use biofuels. Problem solved.
p41
aVTransport ... We don't need oil anymore."
p42
aVWell, what if we grew the biofuels for a road
p43
aVon the grass verge at the edge of the road?
p44
aVHow wide would the verge have to be for that to work out?
p45
aa(lp46
VOK, so let's put in some numbers.
p47
aVLet's have our cars go at 60 miles per hour.
p48
aVLet's say they do 30 miles per gallon.
p49
aVThat's the European average for new cars.
p50
aVLet's say the productivity of biofuel plantations
p51
aVis 1,200 liters of biofuel per hectare per year.
p52
aVThat's true of European biofuels.
p53
aVAnd let's imagine the cars are spaced 80 meters apart from each other,
p54
aVand they're perpetually going along this road.
p55
aVThe length of the road doesn't matter,
p56
aVbecause the longer the road, the more biofuel plantation.
p57
aVWhat do we do with these numbers?
p58
aVTake the first number, divide by the other three, and get eight kilometers.
p59
aVAnd that's the answer.
p60
aVThat's how wide the plantation would have to be,
p61
aVgiven these assumptions.
p62
aVAnd maybe that makes you say, "Hmm.
p63
aVMaybe this isn't going to be quite so easy."
p64
aa(lp65
VAnd it might make you think,
p66
aVperhaps there's an issue to do with areas.
p67
aVAnd in this talk, I'd like to talk about land areas, and ask:
p68
aVIs there an issue about areas?
p69
aVThe answer is going to be yes, but it depends which country you are in.
p70
aa(lp71
VSo let's start in the United Kingdom,
p72
aVsince that's where we are today.
p73
aVThe energy consumption of the United Kingdom,
p74
aVthe total energy consumption \u2014 not just transport, but everything \u2014
p75
aVI like to quantify it in lightbulbs.
p76
aVIt's as if we've all got 125 lightbulbs on all the time,
p77
aV125 kilowatt-hours per day per person
p78
aVis the energy consumption of the UK.
p79
aVSo there's 40 lightbulbs' worth for transport,
p80
aV40 lightbulbs' worth for heating,
p81
aVand 40 lightbulbs' worth for making electricity,
p82
aVand other things are relatively small,
p83
aVcompared to those three big fish.
p84
aVIt's actually a bigger footprint if we take into account
p85
aVthe embodied energy in the stuff we import into our country as well.
p86
aVAnd 90 percent of this energy, today, still comes from fossil fuels,
p87
aVand 10 percent, only, from other, greener \u2014 possibly greener \u2014 sources,
p88
aVlike nuclear power and renewables.
p89
aa(lp90
VSo.
p91
aVThat's the UK.
p92
aVThe population density of the UK is 250 people per square kilometer.
p93
aVI'm now going to show you other countries by these same two measures.
p94
aVOn the vertical axis, I'm going to show you how many lightbulbs \u2014
p95
aVwhat our energy consumption per person is.
p96
aVWe're at 125 lightbulbs per person,
p97
aVand that little blue dot there is showing you the land area
p98
aVof the United Kingdom.
p99
aVThe population density is on the horizontal axis,
p100
aVand we're 250 people per square kilometer.
p101
aVLet's add European countries in blue,
p102
aVand you can see there's quite a variety.
p103
aVI should emphasize, both of these axes are logarithmic;
p104
aVas you go from one gray bar to the next gray bar,
p105
aVyou're going up a factor of 10.
p106
aVNext, let's add Asia in red,
p107
aVthe Middle East and North Africa in green,
p108
aVsub-Saharan Africa in blue,
p109
aVblack is South America,
p110
aVpurple is Central America,
p111
aVand then in pukey-yellow, we have North America,
p112
aVAustralia and New Zealand.
p113
aVYou can see the great diversity of population densities
p114
aVand of per capita consumptions.
p115
aVCountries are different from each other.
p116
aa(lp117
VTop left, we have Canada and Australia, with enormous land areas,
p118
aVvery high per capita consumption \u2014 200 or 300 lightbulbs per person \u2014
p119
aVand very low population densities.
p120
aVTop right: Bahrain has the same energy consumption
p121
aVper person, roughly, as Canada \u2014
p122
aVover 300 lightbulbs per person,
p123
aVbut their population density is a factor of 300 times greater,
p124
aV1,000 people per square kilometer.
p125
aVBottom right: Bangladesh has the same population density as Bahrain,
p126
aVbut consumes 100 times less per person.
p127
aa(lp128
VBottom left: well, there's no one.
p129
aVBut there used to be a whole load of people.
p130
aVHere's another message from this diagram.
p131
aVI've added on little blue tails behind Sudan, Libya,
p132
aVChina, India, Bangladesh.
p133
aVThat's 15 years of progress.
p134
aVWhere were they 15 years ago, and where are they now?
p135
aVAnd the message is,
p136
aVmost countries are going to the right, and they're going up.
p137
aVUp and to the right: bigger population density
p138
aVand higher per capita consumption.
p139
aVSo, we may be off in the top right-hand corner, slightly unusual,
p140
aVthe United Kingdom accompanied by Germany,
p141
aVJapan, South Korea, the Netherlands,
p142
aVand a bunch of other slightly odd countries,
p143
aVbut many other countries are coming up and to the right to join us.
p144
aVSo we're a picture, if you like,
p145
aVof what the future energy consumption
p146
aVmight be looking like in other countries, too.
p147
aa(lp148
VI've also added in this diagram now some pink lines
p149
aVthat go down and to the right.
p150
aVThose are lines of equal power consumption per unit area,
p151
aVwhich I measure in watts per square meter.
p152
aVSo, for example, the middle line there, 0.1 watts per square meter,
p153
aVis the energy consumption per unit area of Saudi Arabia,
p154
aVNorway, Mexico in purple, and Bangladesh 15 years ago.
p155
aVHalf of the world's population lives in countries
p156
aVthat are already above that line.
p157
aVThe United Kingdom is consuming 1.25 watts per square meter.
p158
aVSo is Germany, and Japan is consuming a bit more.
p159
aa(lp160
VSo, let's now say why this is relevant.
p161
aVWhy is it relevant?
p162
aVWell, we can measure renewables in the same units
p163
aVand other forms of power production in the same units.
p164
aVRenewables is one of the leading ideas
p165
aVfor how we could get off our 90 percent fossil-fuel habit.
p166
aVSo here come some renewables.
p167
aVEnergy crops deliver half a watt per square meter
p168
aVin European climates.
p169
aVWhat does that mean?
p170
aVYou might have anticipated that result,
p171
aVgiven what I told you about the biofuel plantation a moment ago.
p172
aVWell, we consume 1.25 watts per square meter.
p173
aVWhat this means is,
p174
aVeven if you covered the whole of the United Kingdom with energy crops,
p175
aVyou couldn't match today's energy consumption.
p176
aVWind power produces a bit more \u2014 2.5 watts per square meter.
p177
aVBut that's only twice as big as 1.25 watts per square meter.
p178
aVSo that means if you wanted, literally, to produce total energy consumption
p179
aVin all forms, on average, from wind farms,
p180
aVyou need wind farms half the area of the UK.
p181
aVI've got data to back up all these assertions, by the way.
p182
aa(lp183
VNext, let's look at solar power.
p184
aVSolar panels, when you put them on a roof,
p185
aVdeliver about 20 watts per square meter in England.
p186
aVIf you really want to get a lot from solar panels,
p187
aVyou need to adopt the traditional Bavarian farming method,
p188
aVwhere you leap off the roof,
p189
aVand coat the countryside with solar panels, too.
p190
aVSolar parks, because of the gaps between the panels, deliver less.
p191
aVThey deliver about 5 watts per square meter of land area.
p192
aVAnd here's a solar park in Vermont, with real data,
p193
aVdelivering 4.2 watts per square meter.
p194
aVRemember where we are, 1.25 watts per square meter,
p195
aVwind farms 2.5, solar parks about five.
p196
aVSo whichever of those renewables you pick,
p197
aVthe message is, whatever mix of those renewables you're using,
p198
aVif you want to power the UK on them,
p199
aVyou're going to need to cover something like
p200
aV20 percent or 25 percent of the country
p201
aVwith those renewables.
p202
aVI'm not saying that's a bad idea; we just need to understand the numbers.
p203
aVI'm absolutely not anti-renewables. I love renewables.
p204
aVBut I'm also pro-arithmetic.
p205
aa(lp206
V(Laughter)
p207
aa(lp208
VConcentrating solar power in deserts delivers larger powers per unit area,
p209
aVbecause you don't have the problem of clouds.
p210
aVSo, this facility delivers 14 watts per square meter;
p211
aVthis one 10 watts per square meter;
p212
aVand this one in Spain, 5 watts per square meter.
p213
aVBeing generous to concentrating solar power,
p214
aVI think it's perfectly credible it could deliver 20 watts per square meter.
p215
aVSo that's nice.
p216
aVOf course, Britain doesn't have any deserts.
p217
aVYet.
p218
aa(lp219
V(Laughter)
p220
aa(lp221
VSo here's a summary so far:
p222
aVAll renewables, much as I love them, are diffuse.
p223
aVThey all have a small power per unit area,
p224
aVand we have to live with that fact.
p225
aVAnd that means, if you do want renewables to make a substantial difference
p226
aVfor a country like the United Kingdom
p227
aVon the scale of today's consumption,
p228
aVyou need to be imagining renewable facilities that are country-sized.
p229
aVNot the entire country,
p230
aVbut a fraction of the country, a substantial fraction.
p231
aa(lp232
VThere are other options for generating power as well,
p233
aVwhich don't involve fossil fuels.
p234
aVSo there's nuclear power, and on this ordinance survey map,
p235
aVyou can see there's a Sizewell B inside a blue square kilometer.
p236
aVThat's one gigawatt in a square kilometer,
p237
aVwhich works out to 1,000 watts per square meter.
p238
aVSo by this particular metric,
p239
aVnuclear power isn't as intrusive as renewables.
p240
aa(lp241
VOf course, other metrics matter, too,
p242
aVand nuclear power has all sorts of popularity problems.
p243
aVBut the same goes for renewables as well.
p244
aVHere's a photograph of a consultation exercise in full swing
p245
aVin the little town of Penicuik just outside Edinburgh,
p246
aVand you can see the children of Penicuik celebrating
p247
aVthe burning of the effigy of the windmill.
p248
aVSo \u2014
p249
aa(lp250
V(Laughter)
p251
aa(lp252
VPeople are anti-everything,
p253
aVand we've got to keep all the options on the table.
p254
aa(lp255
VWhat can a country like the UK do on the supply side?
p256
aVWell, the options are, I'd say, these three:
p257
aVpower renewables,
p258
aVand recognizing that they need to be close to country-sized;
p259
aVother people's renewables,
p260
aVso we could go back and talk very politely
p261
aVto the people in the top left-hand side of the diagram and say,
p262
aV"Uh, we don't want renewables in our backyard,
p263
aVbut, um, please could we put them in yours instead?"
p264
aVAnd that's a serious option.
p265
aVIt's a way for the world to handle this issue.
p266
aVSo countries like Australia, Russia, Libya, Kazakhstan,
p267
aVcould be our best friends for renewable production.
p268
aVAnd a third option is nuclear power.
p269
aVSo that's some supply-side options.
p270
aa(lp271
VIn addition to the supply levers that we can push \u2014
p272
aVand remember, we need large amounts,
p273
aVbecause at the moment, we get 90 percent of our energy from fossil fuels \u2014
p274
aVin addition to those levers,
p275
aVwe could talk about other ways of solving this issue.
p276
aVNamely, we could reduce demand, and that means reducing population \u2014
p277
aVI'm not sure how to do that \u2014
p278
aVor reducing per capita consumption.
p279
aa(lp280
VSo let's talk about three more big levers
p281
aVthat could really help on the consumption side.
p282
aVFirst, transport.
p283
aVHere are the physics principles
p284
aVthat tell you how to reduce the energy consumption of transport.
p285
aVPeople often say, "Technology can answer everything.
p286
aVWe can make vehicles that are 100 times more efficient."
p287
aVAnd that's almost true. Let me show you.
p288
aa(lp289
VThe energy consumption of this typical tank here
p290
aVis 80 kilowatt hours per hundred person kilometers.
p291
aVThat's the average European car.
p292
aVEighty kilowatt hours.
p293
aVCan we make something 100 times better
p294
aVby applying the physics principles I just listed?
p295
aVYes. Here it is. It's the bicycle.
p296
aVIt's 80 times better in energy consumption,
p297
aVand it's powered by biofuel, by Weetabix.
p298
aa(lp299
V(Laughter)
p300
aa(lp301
VAnd there are other options in between,
p302
aVbecause maybe the lady in the tank would say,
p303
aV"No, that's a lifestyle change. Don't change my lifestyle, please."
p304
aVWe could persuade her to take a train, still a lot more efficient than a car,
p305
aVbut that might be a lifestyle change.
p306
aVOr there's the EcoCAR, top-left.
p307
aVIt comfortably accommodates one teenager and it's shorter than a traffic cone,
p308
aVand it's almost as efficient as a bicycle,
p309
aVas long as you drive it at 15 miles per hour.
p310
aVIn between, perhaps some more realistic options
p311
aVon the transport lever are electric vehicles,
p312
aVso electric bikes and electric cars in the middle,
p313
aVperhaps four times as energy efficient as the standard petrol-powered tank.
p314
aa(lp315
VNext, there's the heating lever.
p316
aVHeating is a third of our energy consumption in Britain,
p317
aVand quite a lot of that is going into homes
p318
aVand other buildings,
p319
aVdoing space heating and water heating.
p320
aVSo here's a typical crappy British house.
p321
aVIt's my house, with a Ferrari out front.
p322
aa(lp323
V(Laughter)
p324
aa(lp325
VWhat can we do to it?
p326
aVWell, the laws of physics are written up there,
p327
aVwhich describe how the power consumption for heating
p328
aVis driven by the things you can control.
p329
aVThe things you can control are the temperature difference
p330
aVbetween the inside and the outside.
p331
aVThere's this remarkable technology called a thermostat:
p332
aVyou grasp it, rotate it to the left,
p333
aVand your energy consumption in the home will decrease.
p334
aVI've tried it. It works. Some people call it a lifestyle change.
p335
aa(lp336
V(Laughter)
p337
aa(lp338
VYou can also get the fluff men in to reduce the leakiness
p339
aVof your building \u2014 put fluff in the walls, fluff in the roof,
p340
aVa new front door, and so forth.
p341
aVThe sad truth is, this will save you money.
p342
aVThat's not sad, that's good.
p343
aVBut the sad truth is,
p344
aVit'll only get about 25 percent of the leakiness of your building
p345
aVif you do these things, which are good ideas.
p346
aVIf you really want to get a bit closer to Swedish building standards
p347
aVwith a crappy house like this,
p348
aVyou need to be putting external insulation on the building,
p349
aVas shown by this block of flats in London.
p350
aVYou can also deliver heat more efficiently using heat pumps,
p351
aVwhich use a smaller bit of high-grade energy like electricity
p352
aVto move heat from your garden into your house.
p353
aa(lp354
VThe third demand-side option I want to talk about,
p355
aVthe third way to reduce energy consumption is: read your meters.
p356
aVPeople talk a lot about smart meters,
p357
aVbut you can do it yourself.
p358
aVUse your own eyes and be smart.
p359
aVRead your meter, and if you're anything like me, it'll change your life.
p360
aVHere's a graph I made.
p361
aVI was writing a book about sustainable energy,
p362
aVand a friend asked me,
p363
aV"How much energy do you use at home?"
p364
aVI was embarrassed; I didn't actually know.
p365
aVAnd so I started reading the meter every week.
p366
aVThe old meter readings are shown in the top half of the graph,
p367
aVand then 2007 is shown in green at the bottom.
p368
aVThat was when I was reading the meter every week.
p369
aVAnd my life changed,
p370
aVbecause I started doing experiments and seeing what made a difference.
p371
aVMy gas consumption plummeted,
p372
aVbecause I started tinkering with the thermostat
p373
aVand the timing on the heating system,
p374
aVand I knocked more than half off my gas bills.
p375
aa(lp376
VThere's a similar story for my electricity consumption,
p377
aVwhere switching off the DVD players, the stereos,
p378
aVthe computer peripherals that were on all the time,
p379
aVand just switching them on when I needed them,
p380
aVknocked another third off my electricity bills, too.
p381
aa(lp382
VSo we need a plan that adds up.
p383
aVI've described for you six big levers.
p384
aVWe need big action,
p385
aVbecause we get 90 percent of our energy from fossil fuels,
p386
aVand so you need to push hard on most, if not all, of these levers.
p387
aVMost of these levers have popularity problems,
p388
aVand if there is a lever you don't like the use of,
p389
aVwell, please do bear in mind that means you need even stronger effort
p390
aVon the other levers.
p391
aa(lp392
VSo I'm a strong advocate of having grown-up conversations
p393
aVthat are based on numbers and facts.
p394
aVAnd I want to close with this map that just visualizes for you
p395
aVthe requirement of land and so forth
p396
aVin order to get just 16 lightbulbs per person
p397
aVfrom four of the big possible sources.
p398
aVSo, if you wanted to get 16 lightbulbs \u2014
p399
aVremember, today our total energy consumption is 125 lightbulbs' worth \u2014
p400
aVif you wanted 16 from wind,
p401
aVthis map visualizes a solution for the UK.
p402
aVIt's got 160 wind farms, each 100 square kilometers in size,
p403
aVand that would be a twentyfold increase over today's amount of wind.
p404
aa(lp405
VNuclear power: to get 16 lightbulbs per person,
p406
aVyou'd need two gigawatts at each of the purple dots on the map.
p407
aVThat's a fourfold increase over today's levels of nuclear power.
p408
aa(lp409
VBiomass: to get 16 lightbulbs per person,
p410
aVyou'd need a land area something like three and a half Wales' worth,
p411
aVeither in our country, or in someone else's country,
p412
aVpossibly Ireland, possibly somewhere else.
p413
aa(lp414
V(Laughter)
p415
aa(lp416
VAnd a fourth supply-side option:
p417
aVconcentrating solar power in other people's deserts.
p418
aVIf you wanted to get 16 lightbulbs' worth,
p419
aVthen we're talking about these eight hexagons
p420
aVdown at the bottom right.
p421
aVThe total area of those hexagons is two Greater London's worth
p422
aVof someone else's Sahara,
p423
aVand you'll need power lines all the way across Spain and France
p424
aVto bring the power from the Sahara to Surrey.
p425
aa(lp426
V(Laughter)
p427
aa(lp428
VWe need a plan that adds up.
p429
aVWe need to stop shouting and start talking.
p430
