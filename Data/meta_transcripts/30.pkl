VOnce upon a time, there was a dread disease that afflicted children.
p4
aVAnd in fact, among all the diseases that existed in this land,
p5
aVit was the worst. It killed the most children.
p6
aVAnd along came a brilliant inventor, a scientist,
p7
aVwho came up with a partial cure for that disease.
p8
aVAnd it wasn't perfect. Many children still died,
p9
aVbut it was certainly better than what they had before.
p10
aVAnd one of the good things about this cure was that it was free,
p11
aVvirtually free, and was very easy to use.
p12
aVBut the worst thing about it was that you couldn't use it
p13
aVon the youngest children, on infants, and on one-year-olds.
p14
aa(lp15
VAnd so, as a consequence, a few years later,
p16
aVanother scientist \u2014 perhaps maybe this scientist
p17
aVnot quite as brilliant as the one who had preceded him,
p18
aVbut building on the invention of the first one \u2014
p19
aVcame up with a second cure.
p20
aVAnd the beauty of the second cure for this disease
p21
aVwas that it could be used on infants and one-year-olds.
p22
aVAnd the problem with this cure was it was very expensive,
p23
aVand it was very complicated to use.
p24
aVAnd although parents tried as hard as they could to use it properly,
p25
aValmost all of them ended up using it wrong in the end.
p26
aVBut what they did, of course, since it was so complicated and expensive,
p27
aVthey only used it on the zero-year-olds and the one-year-olds.
p28
aVAnd they kept on using the existing cure that they had
p29
aVon the two-year-olds and up.
p30
aa(lp31
VAnd this went on for quite some time. People were happy.
p32
aVThey had their two cures. Until a particular mother,
p33
aVwhose child had just turned two, died of this disease.
p34
aVAnd she thought to herself, "My child just turned two,
p35
aVand until the child turned two, I had always used
p36
aVthis complicated, expensive cure, you know, this treatment.
p37
aVAnd then the child turned two, and I started using
p38
aVthe cheap and easy treatment, and I wonder" \u2014
p39
aVand she wondered, like all parents who lose children wonder \u2014
p40
aV"if there isn't something that I could have done,
p41
aVlike keep on using that complicated, expensive cure."
p42
aVAnd she told all the other people, and she said,
p43
aV"How could it possibly be that something
p44
aVthat's cheap and simple works as well as something
p45
aVthat's complicated and expensive?"
p46
aVAnd the people thought, "You know, you're right.
p47
aVIt probably is the wrong thing to do to switch
p48
aVand use the cheap and simple solution."
p49
aVAnd the government, they heard her story and the other people,
p50
aVand they said, "Yeah, you're right, we should make a law.
p51
aVWe should outlaw this cheap and simple treatment
p52
aVand not let anybody use this on their children."
p53
aVAnd the people were happy. They were satisfied.
p54
aa(lp55
VFor many years this went along, and everything was fine.
p56
aVBut then along came a lowly economist, who had children himself,
p57
aVand he used the expensive and complicated treatment.
p58
aVBut he knew about the cheap and simple one.
p59
aVAnd he thought about it, and the expensive one
p60
aVdidn't seem that great to him. So he thought,
p61
aV"I don't know anything about science, but I do know something about data,
p62
aVso maybe I should go and look at the data
p63
aVand see whether this expensive and complicated treatment
p64
aVactually works any better than the cheap and simple one."
p65
aVAnd lo and behold, when he went through the data,
p66
aVhe found that it didn't look like the expensive, complicated
p67
aVsolution was any better than the cheap one,
p68
aVat least for the children who were two and older \u2014
p69
aVthe cheap one still didn't work on the kids who were younger.
p70
aa(lp71
VAnd so, he went forth to the people and he said,
p72
aV"I've made this wonderful finding:
p73
aVit looks as if we could just use the cheap and simple solution,
p74
aVand by doing so we could save ourselves 300 million dollars a year,
p75
aVand we could spend that on our children in other ways."
p76
aVAnd the parents were very unhappy, and they said,
p77
aV"This is a terrible thing, because how can the cheap and easy thing
p78
aVbe as good as the hard thing?" And the government was very upset.
p79
aVAnd in particular, the people who made this expensive solution
p80
aVwere very upset because they thought,
p81
aV"How can we hope to compete with something that's essentially free?
p82
aVWe would lose all of our market."
p83
aVAnd people were very angry, and they called him horrible names.
p84
aVAnd he decided that maybe he should leave the country
p85
aVfor a few days, and seek out some more intelligent,
p86
aVopen-minded people in a place called Oxford,
p87
aVand come and try and tell the story at that place.
p88
aa(lp89
VAnd so, anyway, here I am. It's not a fairy tale.
p90
aVIt's a true story about the United States today,
p91
aVand the disease I'm referring to is actually
p92
aVmotor vehicle accidents for children.
p93
aVAnd the free cure is adult seatbelts, and the expensive cure \u2014
p94
aVthe 300-million-dollar-a-year cure \u2014 is child car seats.
p95
aVAnd what I'd like to talk to you about today
p96
aVis some of the evidence why I believe this to be true:
p97
aVthat for children two years old and up,
p98
aVthere really is no real benefit \u2014 proven benefit \u2014 of car seats,
p99
aVin spite of the incredible energy
p100
aVthat has been devoted toward expanding the laws
p101
aVand making it socially unacceptable
p102
aVto put your children into seatbelts. And then talk about why \u2014
p103
aVwhat is it that makes that true?
p104
aVAnd then, finally talk a little bit about a third way,
p105
aVabout another technology, which is probably better than anything we have,
p106
aVbut which \u2014 there hasn't been any enthusiasm for adoption
p107
aVprecisely because people are so enamored
p108
aVwith the current car seat solution. OK.
p109
aa(lp110
VSo, many times when you try to do research on data,
p111
aVit records complicated stories \u2014 it's hard to find in the data.
p112
aVIt doesn't turn out to be the case when you look at seatbelts versus car seats.
p113
aVSo the United States keeps a data set
p114
aVof every fatal accident that's happened since 1975.
p115
aVSo in every car crash in which at least one person dies,
p116
aVthey have information on all of the people.
p117
aVSo if you look at that data \u2014 it's right up on the National Highway
p118
aVTransportation Safety Administration's website \u2014
p119
aVyou can just look at the raw data,
p120
aVand begin to get a sense of the limited amount of evidence
p121
aVthat's in favor of car seats for children aged two and up.
p122
aVSo, here is the data. Here I have, among two- to six-year-olds \u2014
p123
aVanyone above six, basically no one uses car seats,
p124
aVso you can't compare \u2014 29.3 percent of the children who are unrestrained
p125
aVin a crash in which at least one person dies, themselves die.
p126
aVIf you put a child in a car seat, 18.2 percent of the children die.
p127
aVIf they're wearing a lap-and-shoulder belt, in this raw data,
p128
aV19.4 percent die. And interestingly, wearing a lap-only seatbelt,
p129
aV16.7 percent die. And actually, the theory tells you
p130
aVthat the lap-only seatbelt's got to be worse
p131
aVthan the lap-and-shoulder belt. And that just reminds you
p132
aVthat when you deal with raw data, there are hundreds
p133
aVof confounding variables that may be getting in the way.
p134
aa(lp135
VSo what we do in the study is \u2014 and this is just presenting
p136
aVthe same information, but turned into a figure to make it easier.
p137
aVSo the yellow bar represents car seats,
p138
aVthe orange bar lap-and-shoulder, and the red bar lap-only seatbelts.
p139
aVAnd this is all relative to unrestrained \u2014
p140
aVthe bigger the bar, the better. Okay.
p141
aVSo, this is the data I just showed, OK?
p142
aVSo the highest bar is what you're striving to beat.
p143
aVSo you can control for the basic things, like how hard the crash was,
p144
aVwhat seat the child was sitting in, etc., the age of the child.
p145
aVAnd that's that middle set of bars.
p146
aVAnd so, you can see that the lap-only seatbelts
p147
aVstart to look worse once you do that.
p148
aVAnd then finally, the last set of bars,
p149
aVwhich are really controlling for everything
p150
aVyou could possibly imagine about the crash,
p151
aV50, 75, 100 different characteristics of the crash.
p152
aa(lp153
VAnd what you find is that the car seats and the lap-and-shoulder belts,
p154
aVwhen it comes to saving lives, fatalities look exactly identical.
p155
aVAnd the standard error bands are relatively small around these estimates as well.
p156
aVAnd it's not just overall. It's very robust
p157
aVto anything you want to look at.
p158
aVOne thing that's interesting: if you look at frontal-impact crashes \u2014
p159
aVwhen the car crashes, the front hits into something \u2014
p160
aVindeed, what you see is that the car seats look a little bit better.
p161
aVAnd I think this isn't just chance.
p162
aVIn order to have the car seat approved,
p163
aVyou need to pass certain federal standards,
p164
aVall of which involve slamming your car into a direct frontal crash.
p165
aVBut when you look at other types of crashes, like rear-impact crashes,
p166
aVindeed, the car seats don't perform as well.
p167
aVAnd I think that's because they've been optimized to pass,
p168
aVas we always expect people to do,
p169
aVto optimize relative to bright-line rules
p170
aVabout how affected the car will be.
p171
aa(lp172
VAnd the other thing you might argue is,
p173
aV"Well, car seats have got a lot better over time.
p174
aVAnd so if we look at recent crashes \u2014
p175
aVthe whole data set is almost 30 years' worth of data \u2014
p176
aVyou won't see it in the recent crashes. The new car seats are far, far better."
p177
aVBut indeed, in recent crashes the lap-and-shoulder seatbelts,
p178
aVactually, are doing even better than the car seats.
p179
aVThey say, "Well, that's impossible, that can't be."
p180
aVAnd the line of argument, if you ask parents, is,
p181
aV"But car seats are so expensive and complicated,
p182
aVand they have this big tangle of latches,
p183
aVhow could they possibly not work better than seatbelts
p184
aVbecause they are so expensive and complicated?"
p185
aVIt's kind of an interesting logic,
p186
aVI think, that people use. And the other logic, they say,
p187
aV"Well, the government wouldn't have told us [to] use them
p188
aVif they weren't much better."
p189
aa(lp190
VBut what's interesting is the government telling us to use them
p191
aVis not actually based on very much.
p192
aVIt really is based on some impassioned pleas of parents
p193
aVwhose children died after they turned two,
p194
aVwhich has led to the passage of all these laws \u2014 not very much on data.
p195
aVSo you can only get so far, I think, in telling your story
p196
aVby using these abstract statistics.
p197
aVAnd so I had some friends over to dinner, and I was asking \u2014
p198
aVwe had a cookout \u2014 I was asking them what advice they might have for me
p199
aVabout proving my point. They said, "Why don't you run some crash tests?"
p200
aVAnd I said, "That's a great idea."
p201
aVSo we actually tried to commission some crash tests.
p202
aVAnd it turns out that as we called around to the independent
p203
aVcrash test companies around the country,
p204
aVnone of them wanted to do our crash test
p205
aVbecause they said, some explicitly, some not so explicitly,
p206
aV"All of our business comes from car seat manufacturers.
p207
aVWe can't risk alienating them by testing seatbelts relative to car seats."
p208
aa(lp209
VNow, eventually, one did. Under the conditions of anonymity,
p210
aVthey said they would be happy to do this test for us \u2014
p211
aVso anonymity, and 1,500 dollars per seat that we crashed.
p212
aVAnd so, we went to Buffalo, New York,
p213
aVand here is the precursor to it.
p214
aVThese are the crash test dummies,
p215
aVwaiting for their chance to take the center stage.
p216
aVAnd then, here's how the crash test works.
p217
aVHere, they don't actually crash the entire car, you know \u2014
p218
aVit's not worth ruining a whole car to do it.
p219
aVSo they just have these bench seats,
p220
aVand they strap the car seat and the seatbelt onto it.
p221
aVSo I just wanted you to look at this.
p222
aVAnd I think this gives you a good idea of why parents think
p223
aVcar seats are so great. Look at the kid in the car seat.
p224
aVDoes he not look content, ready to go,
p225
aVlike he could survive anything? And then, if you look at the kid in back,
p226
aVit looks like he's already choking before the crash even happens.
p227
aVIt's hard to believe, when you look at this, that
p228
aVthat kid in back is going to do very well when you get in a crash.
p229
aVSo this is going to be a crash
p230
aVwhere they're going to slam this thing forward into a wall
p231
aVat 30 miles an hour, and see what happens. OK?
p232
aa(lp233
VSo, let me show you what happens.
p234
aVThese are three-year-old dummies, by the way.
p235
aVSo here \u2014 this is the car seat. Now watch two things:
p236
aVwatch how the head goes forward,
p237
aVand basically hits the knees \u2014 and this is in the car seat \u2014
p238
aVand watch how the car seat flies around, in the rebound, up in the air.
p239
aVThe car seat's moving all over the place.
p240
aVBear in mind there are two things about this.
p241
aVThis is a car seat that was installed by someone
p242
aVwho has installed 1,000 car seats, who knew exactly how to do it.
p243
aVAnd also it turned out these bench seats
p244
aVare the very best way to install car seats.
p245
aVHaving a flat back makes it much easier to install them.
p246
aVAnd so this is a test that's very much rigged in favor of the car seat,
p247
aVOK? So, that kid in this crash fared very well.
p248
aa(lp249
VThe federal standards are
p250
aVthat you have to score below a 1,000
p251
aVto be an approved car seat on this crash,
p252
aVin some metric of units which are not important.
p253
aVAnd this crash would have been about a 450.
p254
aVSo this car seat was actually an above-average car seat
p255
aVfrom Consumer Reports, and did quite well.
p256
aVSo the next one. Now, this is the kid, same crash,
p257
aVwho is in the seatbelt. He hardly moves at all, actually,
p258
aVrelative to the other child. The funny thing is,
p259
aVthe cam work is terrible because they've only set it up
p260
aVto do the car seats, and so, they actually don't even have a way
p261
aVto move the camera so you can see the kid that's on the rebound.
p262
aVAnyway, it turns out that those two crashes, that actually
p263
aVthe three-year-old did slightly worse. So, he gets about a 500
p264
aVout of \u2014 you know, on this range \u2014 relative to a 400 and something.
p265
aVBut still, if you just took that data from that crash
p266
aVto the federal government, and said, "I have invented a new car seat.
p267
aVI would like you to approve it for selling,"
p268
aVthen they would say, "This is a fantastic new car seat, it works great.
p269
aVIt only got a 500, it could have gotten as high up as a 1,000."
p270
aVAnd this seatbelt would have passed with flying colors
p271
aVinto being approved as a car seat.
p272
aa(lp273
VSo, in some sense, what this is suggesting
p274
aVis that it's not just that people are setting up their car seats wrong,
p275
aVwhich is putting children at risk. It's just that, fundamentally,
p276
aVthe car seats aren't doing much.
p277
aVSo here's the crash. So these are timed at the same time,
p278
aVso you can see that it takes much longer with the car seat \u2014
p279
aVat rebound, it takes a lot longer \u2014
p280
aVbut there's just a lot less movement for child who's in the seatbelt.
p281
aVSo, I'll show you the six-year-old crashes as well.
p282
aVThe six-year-old is in a car seat, and it turns out
p283
aVthat looks terrible, but that's great. That's like a 400, OK?
p284
aVSo that kid would do fine in the crash.
p285
aVNothing about that would have been problematic to the child at all.
p286
aVAnd then here's the six-year-old in the seatbelt,
p287
aVand in fact, they get exactly within, you know,
p288
aVwithin one or two points of the same. So really, for the six-year-old,
p289
aVthe car seat did absolutely nothing whatsoever.
p290
aa(lp291
VThat's some more evidence, so in some sense \u2014
p292
aVI was criticized by a scientist, who said, "You could never publish
p293
aVa study with an n of 4," meaning those four crashes.
p294
aVSo I wrote him back and I said, "What about an n of 45,004?"
p295
aVBecause I had the other 45,000 other real-world crashes.
p296
aVAnd I just think that it's interesting that the idea
p297
aVof using real-world crashes, which is very much something
p298
aVthat economists think would be the right thing to do,
p299
aVis something that scientists don't actually, usually think \u2014
p300
aVthey would rather use a laboratory,
p301
aVa very imperfect science of looking at the dummies,
p302
aVthan actually 30 years of data of what we've seen
p303
aVwith children and with car seats.
p304
aa(lp305
VAnd so I think the answer to this puzzle
p306
aVis that there's a much better solution out there,
p307
aVthat's gotten nobody excited because everyone
p308
aVis so delighted with the way car seats are presumably working.
p309
aVAnd if you think from a design perspective,
p310
aVabout going back to square one, and say,
p311
aV"I just want to protect kids in the back seat."
p312
aVI don't there's anyone in this room who'd say,
p313
aV"Well, the right way to start would be,
p314
aVlet's make a great seat belt for adults.
p315
aVAnd then, let's make this really big contraption
p316
aVthat you have to rig up to it in this daisy chain."
p317
aVI mean, why not start \u2014 who's sitting in the back seat anyway except for kids?
p318
aVBut essentially, do something like this,
p319
aVwhich I don't know exactly how much it would cost to do,
p320
aVbut there's no reason I could see
p321
aVwhy this should be much more expensive than a regular car seat.
p322
aVIt's just actually \u2014 you see, this is folding up \u2014 it's behind the seat.
p323
aVYou've got a regular seat for adults, and then you fold it down,
p324
aVand the kid sits on top, and it's integrated.
p325
aVIt seems to me that this can't be a very expensive solution,
p326
aVand it's got to work better than what we already have.
p327
aa(lp328
VSo the question is, is there any hope for adoption of something like this,
p329
aVwhich would presumably save a lot of lives?
p330
aVAnd I think the answer, perhaps, lies in a story.
p331
aVThe answer both to why has a car seat been so successful,
p332
aVand why this may someday be adopted or not,
p333
aVlies in a story that my dad told me, relating to when he was a doctor
p334
aVin the U.S. Air Force in England. And this is a long time ago:
p335
aVyou were allowed to do things then you can't do today.
p336
aVSo, my father would have patients come in
p337
aVwho he thought were not really sick.
p338
aVAnd he had a big jar full of placebo pills that he would give them,
p339
aVand he'd say, "Come back in a week, if you still feel lousy."
p340
aVOK, and most of them would not come back,
p341
aVbut some of them would come back.
p342
aVAnd when they came back, he, still convinced they were not sick,
p343
aVhad another jar of pills. In this jar were huge horse pills.
p344
aVThey were almost impossible to swallow.
p345
aVAnd these, to me, are the analogy for the car seats.
p346
aVPeople would look at these and say, "Man, this thing is so big
p347
aVand so hard to swallow. If this doesn't make me feel better,
p348
aVyou know, what possibly could?"
p349
aa(lp350
VAnd it turned out that most people wouldn't come back,
p351
aVbecause it worked. But every once in a while,
p352
aVthere was still a patient convinced that he was sick,
p353
aVand he'd come back. And my dad had a third jar of pills.
p354
aVAnd the jar of pills he had, he said,
p355
aVwere the tiniest little pills he could find,
p356
aVso small you could barely see them.
p357
aVAnd he would say, listen, I know I gave you that huge pill,
p358
aVthat complicated, hard-to-swallow pill before,
p359
aVbut now I've got one that's so potent,
p360
aVthat is really tiny and small and almost invisible.
p361
aVIt's almost like this thing here, which you can't even see."
p362
aa(lp363
VAnd it turned out that never,
p364
aVin all the times my dad gave out this pill, the really tiny pill,
p365
aVdid anyone ever come back still complaining of sickness.
p366
aVSo, my dad always took that as evidence
p367
aVthat this little, teeny, powerful pill
p368
aVhad the ultimate placebo effect. And in some sense, if that's the right story,
p369
aVI think integrated car seats you will see, very quickly,
p370
aVbecoming something that everyone has. The other possible conclusion
p371
aVis, well, maybe after coming to my father three times,
p372
aVgetting sent home with placebos, he still felt sick,
p373
aVhe went and found another doctor.
p374
aVAnd that's completely possible. And if that's the case,
p375
aVthen I think we're stuck with conventional car seats for a long time to come.
p376
aVThank you very much.
p377

V(Audience: I just wanted to ask you, when we wear seatbelts
p381
aVwe don't necessarily wear them just to prevent loss of life,
p382
aVit's also to prevent lots of serious injury.
p383
aVYour data looks at fatalities. It doesn't look at serious injury.
p384
aVIs there any data to show that child seats
p385
aVare actually less effective, or just as effective as seatbelts
p386
aVfor serious injury? Because that would prove your case.)

VSteven Levitt: Yeah, that's a great question. In my data, and in another data set
p389
aVI've looked at for New Jersey crashes,
p390
aVI find very small differences in injury.
p391
aVSo in this data, it's statistically insignificant differences
p392
aVin injury between car seats and lap-and-shoulder belts.
p393
aVIn the New Jersey data, which is different,
p394
aVbecause it's not just fatal crashes,
p395
aVbut all crashes in New Jersey that are reported,
p396
aVit turns out that there is a 10 percent difference in injuries,
p397
aVbut generally they're the minor injuries.
p398
aVNow, what's interesting, I should say this as a disclaimer,
p399
aVthere is medical literature that is very difficult to resolve with this other data,
p400
aVwhich suggests that car seats are dramatically better.
p401

VAnd they use a completely different methodology that involves \u2014
p403
aVafter the crash occurs, they get from the insurance companies
p404
aVthe names of the people who were in the crash,
p405
aVand they call them on the phone,
p406
aVand they asked them what happened.
p407
aVAnd I really can't resolve, yet,
p408
aVand I'd like to work with these medical researchers
p409
aVto try to understand how there can be these differences,
p410
aVwhich are completely at odds with one another.
p411
aVBut it's obviously a critical question.
p412
aVThe question is even if \u2014 are there enough serious injuries
p413
aVto make these cost-effective? It's kind of tricky.
p414
aVEven if they're right, it's not so clear
p415
aVthat they're so cost-effective.
