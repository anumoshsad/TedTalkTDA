(lp3
VA few days after my husband Paul was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer,
p4
aVwe were lying in our bed at home,
p5
aVand Paul said,
p6
aV"It's going to be OK."
p7
aVAnd I remember answering back,
p8
aV"Yes.
p9
aVWe just don't know what OK means yet."
p10
aa(lp11
VPaul and I had met as first-year medical students at Yale.
p12
aVHe was smart and kind and super funny.
p13
aVHe used to keep a gorilla suit in the trunk of his car,
p14
aVand he'd say, "It's for emergencies only."
p15
aa(lp16
V(Laughter)
p17
aa(lp18
VI fell in love with Paul as I watched the care he took with his patients.
p19
aVHe stayed late talking with them,
p20
aVseeking to understand the experience of illness
p21
aVand not just its technicalities.
p22
aVHe later told me he fell in love with me
p23
aVwhen he saw me cry over an EKG of a heart that had ceased beating.
p24
aVWe didn't know it yet,
p25
aVbut even in the heady days of young love,
p26
aVwe were learning how to approach suffering together.
p27
aa(lp28
VWe got married and became doctors.
p29
aVI was working as an internist
p30
aVand Paul was finishing his training as a neurosurgeon
p31
aVwhen he started to lose weight.
p32
aVHe developed excruciating back pain and a cough that wouldn't go away.
p33
aVAnd when he was admitted to the hospital,
p34
aVa CT scan revealed tumors in Paul's lungs and in his bones.
p35
aVWe had both cared for patients with devastating diagnoses;
p36
aVnow it was our turn.
p37
aa(lp38
VWe lived with Paul's illness for 22 months.
p39
aVHe wrote a memoir about facing mortality.
p40
aVI gave birth to our daughter Cady,
p41
aVand we loved her and each other.
p42
aVWe learned directly how to struggle through really tough medical decisions.
p43
aVThe day we took Paul into the hospital for the last time
p44
aVwas the most difficult day of my life.
p45
aVWhen he turned to me at the end
p46
aVand said, "I'm ready,"
p47
aVI knew that wasn't just a brave decision.
p48
aVIt was the right one.
p49
aVPaul didn't want a ventilator and CPR.
p50
aVIn that moment,
p51
aVthe most important thing to Paul
p52
aVwas to hold our baby daughter.
p53
aVNine hours later,
p54
aVPaul died.
p55
aa(lp56
VI've always thought of myself as a caregiver \u2014
p57
aVmost physicians do \u2014
p58
aVand taking care of Paul deepened what that meant.
p59
aVWatching him reshape his identity during his illness,
p60
aVlearning to witness and accept his pain,
p61
aVtalking together through his choices \u2014
p62
aVthose experiences taught me
p63
aVthat resilience does not mean bouncing back to where you were before,
p64
aVor pretending that the hard stuff isn't hard.
p65
aVIt is so hard.
p66
aVIt's painful, messy stuff.
p67
aVBut it's the stuff.
p68
aVAnd I learned that when we approach it together,
p69
aVwe get to decide what success looks like.
p70
aa(lp71
VOne of the first things Paul said to me after his diagnosis was,
p72
aV"I want you to get remarried."
p73
aVAnd I was like, whoa, I guess we get to say anything out loud.
p74
aa(lp75
V(Laughter)
p76
aa(lp77
VIt was so shocking
p78
aVand heartbreaking ...
p79
aVand generous,
p80
aVand really comforting
p81
aVbecause it was so starkly honest,
p82
aVand that honesty turned out to be exactly what we needed.
p83
aVEarly in Paul's illness,
p84
aVwe agreed we would just keep saying things out loud.
p85
aVTasks like making a will,
p86
aVor completing our advance directives \u2014
p87
aVtasks that I had always avoided \u2014
p88
aVwere not as daunting as they once seemed.
p89
aVI realized that completing an advance directive is an act of love \u2014
p90
aVlike a wedding vow.
p91
aVA pact to take care of someone,
p92
aVcodifying the promise
p93
aVthat til death do us part,
p94
aVI will be there.
p95
aVIf needed, I will speak for you.
p96
aVI will honor your wishes.
p97
aVThat paperwork became a tangible part of our love story.
p98
aa(lp99
VAs physicians,
p100
aVPaul and I were in a good position
p101
aVto understand and even accept his diagnosis.
p102
aVWe weren't angry about it,
p103
aVluckily,
p104
aVbecause we'd seen so many patients in devastating situations,
p105
aVand we knew that death is a part of life.
p106
aVBut it's one thing to know that;
p107
aVit was a very different experience
p108
aVto actually live with the sadness and uncertainty of a serious illness.
p109
aVHuge strides are being made against lung cancer,
p110
aVbut we knew that Paul likely had months to a few years left to live.
p111
aa(lp112
VDuring that time,
p113
aVPaul wrote about his transition from doctor to patient.
p114
aVHe talked about feeling like he was suddenly at a crossroads,
p115
aVand how he would have thought he'd be able to see the path,
p116
aVthat because he treated so many patients,
p117
aVmaybe he could follow in their footsteps.
p118
aVBut he was totally disoriented.
p119
aVRather than a path,
p120
aVPaul wrote,
p121
aV"I saw instead
p122
aVonly a harsh, vacant, gleaming white desert.
p123
aVAs if a sandstorm had erased all familiarity.
p124
aVI had to face my mortality
p125
aVand try to understand what made my life worth living,
p126
aVand I needed my oncologist's help to do so."
p127
aa(lp128
VThe clinicians taking care of Paul
p129
aVgave me an even deeper appreciation for my colleagues in health care.
p130
aVWe have a tough job.
p131
aVWe're responsible for helping patients have clarity around their prognoses
p132
aVand their treatment options,
p133
aVand that's never easy, but it's especially tough
p134
aVwhen you're dealing with potentially terminal illnesses like cancer.
p135
aVSome people don't want to know how long they have left,
p136
aVothers do.
p137
aVEither way, we never have those answers.
p138
aVSometimes we substitute hope
p139
aVby emphasizing the best-case scenario.
p140
aVIn a survey of physicians,
p141
aV55 percent said they painted a rosier picture
p142
aVthan their honest opinion
p143
aVwhen describing a patient's prognosis.
p144
aVIt's an instinct born out of kindness.
p145
aVBut researchers have found
p146
aVthat when people better understand the possible outcomes of an illness,
p147
aVthey have less anxiety,
p148
aVgreater ability to plan
p149
aVand less trauma for their families.
p150
aa(lp151
VFamilies can struggle with those conversations,
p152
aVbut for us, we also found that information immensely helpful with big decisions.
p153
aVMost notably,
p154
aVwhether to have a baby.
p155
aVMonths to a few years meant Paul was not likely to see her grow up.
p156
aVBut he had a good chance of being there for her birth
p157
aVand for the beginning of her life.
p158
aVI remember asking Paul
p159
aVif he thought having to say goodbye to a child
p160
aVwould make dying even more painful.
p161
aVAnd his answer astounded me.
p162
aVHe said,
p163
aV"Wouldn't it be great if it did?"
p164
aVAnd we did it.
p165
aVNot in order to spite cancer,
p166
aVbut because we were learning
p167
aVthat living fully means accepting suffering.
p168
aa(lp169
VPaul's oncologist tailored his chemo
p170
aVso he could continue working as a neurosurgeon,
p171
aVwhich initially we thought was totally impossible.
p172
aVWhen the cancer advanced
p173
aVand Paul shifted from surgery to writing,
p174
aVhis palliative care doctor prescribed a stimulant medication
p175
aVso he could be more focused.
p176
aVThey asked Paul about his priorities and his worries.
p177
aVThey asked him what trade-offs he was willing to make.
p178
aVThose conversations are the best way to ensure
p179
aVthat your health care matches your values.
p180
aVPaul joked that it's not like that "birds and bees" talk
p181
aVyou have with your parents,
p182
aVwhere you all get it over with as quickly as possible,
p183
aVand then pretend it never happened.
p184
aVYou revisit the conversation as things change.
p185
aVYou keep saying things out loud.
p186
aVI'm forever grateful
p187
aVbecause Paul's clinicians felt
p188
aVthat their job wasn't to try to give us answers they didn't have,
p189
aVor only to try to fix things for us,
p190
aVbut to counsel Paul through painful choices ...
p191
aVwhen his body was failing but his will to live wasn't.
p192
aa(lp193
VLater, after Paul died,
p194
aVI received a dozen bouquets of flowers,
p195
aVbut I sent just one ...
p196
aVto Paul's oncologist,
p197
aVbecause she supported his goals
p198
aVand she helped him weigh his choices.
p199
aVShe knew that living means more than just staying alive.
p200
aa(lp201
VA few weeks ago, a patient came into my clinic.
p202
aVA woman dealing with a serious chronic disease.
p203
aVAnd while we were talking about her life and her health care,
p204
aVshe said, "I love my palliative care team.
p205
aVThey taught me that it's OK to say 'no'."
p206
aVYeah, I thought, of course it is.
p207
aVBut many patients don't feel that.
p208
aVCompassion and Choices did a study
p209
aVwhere they asked people about their health care preferences.
p210
aVAnd a lot of people started their answers with the words
p211
aV"Well, if I had a choice ..."
p212
aVIf I had a choice.
p213
aVAnd when I read that "if,"
p214
aVI understood better
p215
aVwhy one in four people
p216
aVreceives excessive or unwanted medical treatment,
p217
aVor watches a family member receive excessive or unwanted medical treatment.
p218
aVIt's not because doctors don't get it.
p219
aVWe do.
p220
aVWe understand the real psychological consequences
p221
aVon patients and their families.
p222
aVThe things is, we deal with them, too.
p223
aVHalf of critical care nurses and a quarter of ICU doctors
p224
aVhave considered quitting their jobs
p225
aVbecause of distress over feeling that for some of their patients,
p226
aVthey've provided care that didn't fit with the person's values.
p227
aVBut doctors can't make sure your wishes are respected
p228
aVuntil they know what they are.
p229
aa(lp230
VWould you want to be on life support if it offered any chance of longer life?
p231
aVAre you most worried about the quality of that time,
p232
aVrather than quantity?
p233
aVBoth of those choices are thoughtful and brave,
p234
aVbut for all of us, it's our choice.
p235
aVThat's true at the end of life
p236
aVand for medical care throughout our lives.
p237
aVIf you're pregnant, do you want genetic screening?
p238
aVIs a knee replacement right or not?
p239
aVDo you want to do dialysis in a clinic or at home?
p240
aVThe answer is:
p241
aVit depends.
p242
aVWhat medical care will help you live the way you want to?
p243
aVI hope you remember that question
p244
aVthe next time you face a decision in your health care.
p245
aVRemember that you always have a choice,
p246
aVand it is OK to say no to a treatment that's not right for you.
p247
aa(lp248
VThere's a poem by W.S. Merwin \u2014
p249
aVit's just two sentences long \u2014
p250
aVthat captures how I feel now.
p251
aV"Your absence has gone through me
p252
aVlike thread through a needle.
p253
aVEverything I do is stitched with its color."
p254
aVFor me that poem evokes my love for Paul,
p255
aVand a new fortitude
p256
aVthat came from loving and losing him.
p257
aa(lp258
VWhen Paul said, "It's going to be OK,"
p259
aVthat didn't mean that we could cure his illness.
p260
aVInstead, we learned to accept both joy and sadness at the same time;
p261
aVto uncover beauty and purpose
p262
aVboth despite and because we are all born
p263
aVand we all die.
p264
aVAnd for all the sadness and sleepless nights,
p265
aVit turns out there is joy.
p266
aVI leave flowers on Paul's grave
p267
aVand watch our two-year-old run around on the grass.
p268
aVI build bonfires on the beach and watch the sunset with our friends.
p269
aVExercise and mindfulness meditation have helped a lot.
p270
aVAnd someday,
p271
aVI hope I do get remarried.
p272
aa(lp273
VMost importantly, I get to watch our daughter grow.
p274
aVI've thought a lot about what I'm going to say to her
p275
aVwhen she's older.
p276
aV"Cady,
p277
aVengaging in the full range of experience \u2014
p278
aVliving and dying,
p279
aVlove and loss \u2014
p280
aVis what we get to do.
p281
aVBeing human doesn't happen despite suffering.
p282
aVIt happens within it.
p283
aVWhen we approach suffering together,
p284
aVwhen we choose not to hide from it,
p285
aVour lives don't diminish,
p286
aVthey expand."
p287
aa(lp288
VI've learned that cancer isn't always a battle.
p289
aVOr if it is,
p290
aVmaybe it's a fight for something different than we thought.
p291
aVOur job isn't to fight fate,
p292
aVbut to help each other through.
p293
aVNot as soldiers
p294
aVbut as shepherds.
p295
aVThat's how we make it OK,
p296
aVeven when it's not.
p297
aVBy saying it out loud,
p298
aVby helping each other through ...
p299
aVand a gorilla suit never hurts, either.
p300
