VI'm here to offer you a new way to think about my field,
p4
aVartificial intelligence.
p5
aVI think the purpose of AI
p6
aVis to empower humans with machine intelligence.
p7
aVAnd as machines get smarter,
p8
aVwe get smarter.
p9
aVI call this "humanistic AI" \u2014
p10
aVartificial intelligence designed to meet human needs
p11
aVby collaborating and augmenting people.
p12
aVNow, today I'm happy to see
p13
aVthat the idea of an intelligent assistant
p14
aVis mainstream.
p15
aVIt's the well-accepted metaphor for the interface between humans and AI.
p16
aVAnd the one I helped create is called Siri.
p17
aa(lp18
VYou know Siri.
p19
aVSiri is the thing that knows your intent
p20
aVand helps you do it for you,
p21
aVhelps you get things done.
p22
aVBut what you might not know is that we designed Siri
p23
aVas humanistic AI,
p24
aVto augment people with a conversational interface
p25
aVthat made it possible for them to use mobile computing,
p26
aVregardless of who they were and their abilities.
p27
aa(lp28
VNow for most of us,
p29
aVthe impact of this technology
p30
aVis to make things a little bit easier to use.
p31
aVBut for my friend Daniel,
p32
aVthe impact of the AI in these systems is a life changer.
p33
aVYou see, Daniel is a really social guy,
p34
aVand he's blind and quadriplegic,
p35
aVwhich makes it hard to use those devices that we all take for granted.
p36
aVThe last time I was at his house, his brother said,
p37
aV"Hang on a second, Daniel's not ready.
p38
aVHe's on the phone with a woman he met online."
p39
aVI'm like, "That's cool, how'd he do it?"
p40
aVWell, Daniel uses Siri to manage his own social life \u2014
p41
aVhis email, text and phone \u2014
p42
aVwithout depending on his caregivers.
p43
aVThis is kind of interesting, right?
p44
aVThe irony here is great.
p45
aVHere's the man whose relationship with AI
p46
aVhelps him have relationships with genuine human beings.
p47
aVAnd this is humanistic AI.
p48
aa(lp49
VAnother example with life-changing consequences
p50
aVis diagnosing cancer.
p51
aVWhen a doctor suspects cancer,
p52
aVthey take a sample and send it to a pathologist,
p53
aVwho looks at it under a microscope.
p54
aVNow, pathologists look at hundreds of slides
p55
aVand millions of cells every day.
p56
aVSo to support this task,
p57
aVsome researchers made an AI classifier.
p58
aVNow, the classifier says, "Is this cancer or is this not cancer?"
p59
aVlooking at the pictures.
p60
aVThe classifier was pretty good,
p61
aVbut not as good as the person,
p62
aVwho got it right most of the time.
p63
aa(lp64
VBut when they combine the ability of the machine and the human together,
p65
aVaccuracy went to 99.5 percent.
p66
aVAdding that AI to a partnership eliminated 85 percent of the errors
p67
aVthat the human pathologist would have made working alone.
p68
aVThat's a lot of cancer that would have otherwise gone untreated.
p69
aVNow, for the curious, it turns out
p70
aVthat the human was better at rejecting false positives,
p71
aVand the machine was better at recognizing those hard-to-spot cases.
p72
aVBut the lesson here isn't about which agent is better
p73
aVat this image-classification task.
p74
aVThose things are changing every day.
p75
aVThe lesson here
p76
aVis that by combining the abilities of the human and machine,
p77
aVit created a partnership that had superhuman performance.
p78
aVAnd that is humanistic AI.
p79
aa(lp80
VNow let's look at another example
p81
aVwith turbocharging performance.
p82
aVThis is design.
p83
aVNow, let's say you're an engineer.
p84
aVYou want to design a new frame for a drone.
p85
aVYou get out your favorite software tools, CAD tools,
p86
aVand you enter the form and the materials, and then you analyze performance.
p87
aVThat gives you one design.
p88
aVIf you give those same tools to an AI,
p89
aVit can generate thousands of designs.
p90
aa(lp91
VThis video by Autodesk is amazing.
p92
aVThis is real stuff.
p93
aVSo this transforms how we do design.
p94
aVThe human engineer now
p95
aVsays what the design should achieve,
p96
aVand the machine says,
p97
aV"Here's the possibilities."
p98
aVNow in her job, the engineer's job
p99
aVis to pick the one that best meets the goals of the design,
p100
aVwhich she knows as a human better than anyone else,
p101
aVusing human judgment and expertise.
p102
aVIn this case, the winning form
p103
aVlooks kind of like something nature would have designed,
p104
aVminus a few million years of evolution
p105
aVand all that unnecessary fur.
p106
aa(lp107
VNow let's see where this idea of humanistic AI might lead us
p108
aVif we follow it into the speculative beyond.
p109
aVWhat's a kind of augmentation that we would all like to have?
p110
aVWell, how about cognitive enhancement?
p111
aVInstead of asking,
p112
aV"How smart can we make our machines?"
p113
aVlet's ask
p114
aV"How smart can our machines make us?"
p115
aVI mean, take memory for example.
p116
aVMemory is the foundation of human intelligence.
p117
aVBut human memory is famously flawed.
p118
aVWe're great at telling stories,
p119
aVbut not getting the details right.
p120
aVAnd our memories \u2014 they decay over time.
p121
aVI mean, like, where did the '60s go, and can I go there, too?
p122
aa(lp123
V(Laughter)
p124
aa(lp125
VBut what if you could have a memory that was as good as computer memory,
p126
aVand was about your life?
p127
aVWhat if you could remember every person you ever met,
p128
aVhow to pronounce their name,
p129
aVtheir family details, their favorite sports,
p130
aVthe last conversation you had with them?
p131
aVIf you had this memory all your life,
p132
aVyou could have the AI look at all the interactions
p133
aVyou had with people over time
p134
aVand help you reflect on the long arc of your relationships.
p135
aVWhat if you could have the AI read everything you've ever read
p136
aVand listen to every song you've ever heard?
p137
aVFrom the tiniest clue, it could help you retrieve
p138
aVanything you've ever seen or heard before.
p139
aVImagine what that would do for the ability to make new connections
p140
aVand form new ideas.
p141
aa(lp142
VAnd what about our bodies?
p143
aVWhat if we could remember the consequences of every food we eat,
p144
aVevery pill we take,
p145
aVevery all-nighter we pull?
p146
aVWe could do our own science on our own data
p147
aVabout what makes us feel good and stay healthy.
p148
aVAnd imagine how this could revolutionize
p149
aVthe way we manage allergies and chronic disease.
p150
aa(lp151
VI believe that AI will make personal memory enhancement a reality.
p152
aVI can't say when or what form factors are involved,
p153
aVbut I think it's inevitable,
p154
aVbecause the very things that make AI successful today \u2014
p155
aVthe availability of comprehensive data
p156
aVand the ability for machines to make sense of that data \u2014
p157
aVcan be applied to the data of our lives.
p158
aVAnd those data are here today, available for all of us,
p159
aVbecause we lead digitally mediated lives,
p160
aVin mobile and online.
p161
aa(lp162
VIn my view, a personal memory is a private memory.
p163
aVWe get to choose what is and is not recalled and retained.
p164
aVIt's absolutely essential that this be kept very secure.
p165
aa(lp166
VNow for most of us,
p167
aVthe impact of augmented personal memory
p168
aVwill be a more improved mental gain,
p169
aVmaybe, hopefully, a bit more social grace.
p170
aVBut for the millions who suffer from Alzheimer's and dementia,
p171
aVthe difference that augmented memory could make
p172
aVis a difference between a life of isolation
p173
aVand a life of dignity and connection.
p174
aa(lp175
VWe are in the middle of a renaissance in artificial intelligence right now.
p176
aVI mean, in just the past few years,
p177
aVwe're beginning to see solutions to AI problems
p178
aVthat we have struggled with literally for decades:
p179
aVspeech understanding, text understanding,
p180
aVimage understanding.
p181
aVWe have a choice in how we use this powerful technology.
p182
aVWe can choose to use AI to automate and compete with us,
p183
aVor we can use AI to augment and collaborate with us,
p184
aVto overcome our cognitive limitations
p185
aVand to help us do what we want to do,
p186
aVonly better.
p187
aVAnd as we discover new ways to give machines intelligence,
p188
aVwe can distribute that intelligence
p189
aVto all of the AI assistants in the world,
p190
aVand therefore to every person, regardless of circumstance.
p191
aVAnd that is why,
p192
aVevery time a machine gets smarter,
p193
aVwe get smarter.
p194
aa(lp195
VThat is an AI worth spreading.
p196
aa(lp197
VThank you.
