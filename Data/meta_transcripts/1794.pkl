VI'm going to talk about consciousness.
p4
aVWhy consciousness?
p5
aVWell, it's a curiously neglected subject,
p6
aVboth in our scientific and our philosophical culture.
p7
aVNow why is that curious?
p8
aVWell, it is the most important aspect of our lives
p9
aVfor a very simple, logical reason,
p10
aVnamely, it's a necessary condition on anything
p11
aVbeing important in our lives that we're conscious.
p12
aVYou care about science, philosophy, music, art, whatever \u2014
p13
aVit's no good if you're a zombie or in a coma, right?
p14
aVSo consciousness is number one.
p15
aVThe second reason is that when people do
p16
aVget interested in it, as I think they should,
p17
aVthey tend to say the most appalling things.
p18
aVAnd then, even when they're not saying appalling things
p19
aVand they're really trying to do serious research,
p20
aVwell, it's been slow. Progress has been slow.
p21
aVWhen I first got interested in this, I thought, well,
p22
aVit's a straightforward problem in biology.
p23
aVLet's get these brain stabbers to get busy and figure out
p24
aVhow it works in the brain.
p25
aVSo I went over to UCSF and I talked to all
p26
aVthe heavy-duty neurobiologists there,
p27
aVand they showed some impatience,
p28
aVas scientists often do when you ask them embarrassing questions.
p29
aVBut the thing that struck me is, one guy said in exasperation,
p30
aVa very famous neurobiologist, he said, "Look,
p31
aVin my discipline it's okay to be interested in consciousness,
p32
aVbut get tenure first. Get tenure first."
p33
aVNow I've been working on this for a long time.
p34
aVI think now you might actually get tenure
p35
aVby working on consciousness.
p36
aVIf so, that's a real step forward.
p37
aVOkay, now why then is this curious reluctance
p38
aVand curious hostility to consciousness?
p39
aVWell, I think it's a combination of two features
p40
aVof our intellectual culture
p41
aVthat like to think they're opposing each other
p42
aVbut in fact they share a common set of assumptions.
p43
aVOne feature is the tradition of religious dualism:
p44
aVConsciousness is not a part of the physical world.
p45
aVIt's a part of the spiritual world.
p46
aVIt belongs to the soul,
p47
aVand the soul is not a part of the physical world.
p48
aVThat's the tradition of God, the soul and immortality.
p49
aVThere's another tradition that thinks it's opposed to this
p50
aVbut accepts the worst assumption.
p51
aVThat tradition thinks that we are heavy-duty scientific materialists:
p52
aVConsciousness is not a part of the physical world.
p53
aVEither it doesn't exist at all, or it's something else,
p54
aVa computer program or some damn fool thing,
p55
aVbut in any case it's not part of science.
p56
aVAnd I used to get in an argument that really gave me a stomachache.
p57
aVHere's how it went.
p58
aVScience is objective, consciousness is subjective,
p59
aVtherefore there cannot be a science of consciousness.
p60
aVOkay, so these twin traditions are paralyzing us.
p61
aVIt's very hard to get out of these twin traditions.
p62
aVAnd I have only one real message in this lecture,
p63
aVand that is, consciousness is a biological phenomenon
p64
aVlike photosynthesis, digestion, mitosis \u2014
p65
aVyou know all the biological phenomena \u2014 and once you accept that,
p66
aVmost, though not all, of the hard problems
p67
aVabout consciousness simply evaporate.
p68
aVAnd I'm going to go through some of them.
p69
aVOkay, now I promised you to tell you some
p70
aVof the outrageous things said about consciousness.
p71
aVOne: Consciousness does not exist.
p72
aVIt's an illusion, like sunsets.
p73
aVScience has shown sunsets and rainbows are illusions.
p74
aVSo consciousness is an illusion.
p75
aVTwo: Well, maybe it exists, but it's really something else.
p76
aVIt's a computer program running in the brain.
p77
aVThree: No, the only thing that exists is really behavior.
p78
aVIt's embarrassing how influential behaviorism was,
p79
aVbut I'll get back to that.
p80
aVAnd four: Maybe consciousness exists,
p81
aVbut it can't make any difference to the world.
p82
aVHow could spirituality move anything?
p83
aVNow, whenever somebody tells me that, I think,
p84
aVyou want to see spirituality move something?
p85
aVWatch. I decide consciously to raise my arm,
p86
aVand the damn thing goes up. (Laughter)
p87
aVFurthermore, notice this:
p88
aVWe do not say, "Well, it's a bit like the weather in Geneva.
p89
aVSome days it goes up and some days it doesn't go up."
p90
aVNo. It goes up whenever I damn well want it to.
p91
aVOkay. I'm going to tell you how that's possible.
p92
aVNow, I haven't yet given you a definition.
p93
aVYou can't do this if you don't give a definition.
p94
aVPeople always say consciousness is very hard to define.
p95
aVI think it's rather easy to define
p96
aVif you're not trying to give a scientific definition.
p97
aVWe're not ready for a scientific definition,
p98
aVbut here's a common-sense definition.
p99
aVConsciousness consists of all those states of feeling
p100
aVor sentience or awareness.
p101
aVIt begins in the morning when you wake up from a dreamless sleep,
p102
aVand it goes on all day until you fall asleep
p103
aVor die or otherwise become unconscious.
p104
aVDreams are a form of consciousness on this definition.
p105
aVNow, that's the common-sense definition. That's our target.
p106
aVIf you're not talking about that, you're not talking about consciousness.
p107
aVBut they think, "Well, if that's it, that's an awful problem.
p108
aVHow can such a thing exist as part of the real world?"
p109
aVAnd this, if you've ever had a philosophy course,
p110
aVthis is known as the famous mind-body problem.
p111
aVI think that has a simple solution too. I'm going to give it to you.
p112
aVAnd here it is: All of our conscious states, without exception,
p113
aVare caused by lower-level neurobiological processes in the brain,
p114
aVand they are realized in the brain
p115
aVas higher-level or system features.
p116
aVIt's about as mysterious as the liquidity of water.
p117
aVRight? The liquidity is not an extra juice squirted out
p118
aVby the H2O molecules.
p119
aVIt's a condition that the system is in.
p120
aVAnd just as the jar full of water can go from liquid to solid
p121
aVdepending on the behavior of the molecules,
p122
aVso your brain can go from a state of being conscious
p123
aVto a state of being unconscious,
p124
aVdepending on the behavior of the molecules.
p125
aVThe famous mind-body problem is that simple.
p126
aVAll right? But now we get into some harder questions.
p127
aVLet's specify the exact features of consciousness,
p128
aVso that we can then answer those four objections
p129
aVthat I made to it.
p130
aVWell, the first feature is, it's real and irreducible.
p131
aVYou can't get rid of it.
p132
aVYou see, the distinction between reality and illusion
p133
aVis the distinction between how things
p134
aVconsciously seem to us and how they really are.
p135
aVIt consciously seems like there's \u2014
p136
aVI like the French "arc-en-ciel" \u2014
p137
aVit seems like there's an arch in the sky,
p138
aVor it seems like the sun is setting over the mountains.
p139
aVIt consciously seems to us, but that's not really happening.
p140
aVBut for that distinction between
p141
aVhow things consciously seem and how they really are,
p142
aVyou can't make that distinction for the very existence of consciousness,
p143
aVbecause where the very existence of consciousness is concerned,
p144
aVif it consciously seems to you that you are conscious,
p145
aVyou are conscious.
p146
aVI mean, if a bunch of experts come to me and say,
p147
aV"We are heavy-duty neurobiologists and we've done a study
p148
aVof you, Searle, and we're convinced you are not conscious,
p149
aVyou are a very cleverly constructed robot,"
p150
aVI don't think, "Well, maybe these guys are right, you know?"
p151
aVI don't think that for a moment, because, I mean,
p152
aVDescartes may have made a lot of mistakes, but he was right about this.
p153
aVYou cannot doubt the existence of your own consciousness.
p154
aVOkay, that's the first feature of consciousness.
p155
aVIt's real and irreducible.
p156
aVYou cannot get rid of it by showing that it's an illusion
p157
aVin a way that you can with other standard illusions.
p158
aVOkay, the second feature is this one
p159
aVthat has been such a source of trouble to us,
p160
aVand that is, all of our conscious states
p161
aVhave this qualitative character to them.
p162
aVThere's something that it feels like to drink beer
p163
aVwhich is not what it feels like to do your income tax
p164
aVor listen to music, and this qualitative feel
p165
aVautomatically generates a third feature,
p166
aVnamely, conscious states are by definition subjective
p167
aVin the sense that they only exist as experienced
p168
aVby some human or animal subject,
p169
aVsome self that experiences them.
p170
aVMaybe we'll be able to build a conscious machine.
p171
aVSince we don't know how our brains do it,
p172
aVwe're not in a position, so far, to build a conscious machine.
p173
aVOkay. Another feature of consciousness
p174
aVis that it comes in unified conscious fields.
p175
aVSo I don't just have the sight of the people in front of me
p176
aVand the sound of my voice and the weight of my shoes
p177
aVagainst the floor, but they occur to me
p178
aVas part of one single great conscious field
p179
aVthat stretches forward and backward.
p180
aVThat is the key to understanding
p181
aVthe enormous power of consciousness.
p182
aVAnd we have not been able to do that in a robot.
p183
aVThe disappointment of robotics derives from the fact
p184
aVthat we don't know how to make a conscious robot,
p185
aVso we don't have a machine that can do this kind of thing.
p186
aVOkay, the next feature of consciousness,
p187
aVafter this marvelous unified conscious field,
p188
aVis that it functions causally in our behavior.
p189
aVI gave you a scientific demonstration by raising my hand,
p190
aVbut how is that possible?
p191
aVHow can it be that this thought in my brain
p192
aVcan move material objects?
p193
aVWell, I'll tell you the answer.
p194
aVI mean, we don't know the detailed answer,
p195
aVbut we know the basic part of the answer, and that is,
p196
aVthere is a sequence of neuron firings,
p197
aVand they terminate where the acetylcholine
p198
aVis secreted at the axon end-plates of the motor neurons.
p199
aVSorry to use philosophical terminology here,
p200
aVbut when it's secreted at the axon end-plates of the motor neurons,
p201
aVa whole lot of wonderful things happen in the ion channels
p202
aVand the damned arm goes up.
p203
aVNow, think of what I told you.
p204
aVOne and the same event,
p205
aVmy conscious decision to raise my arm
p206
aVhas a level of description where it has all of these
p207
aVtouchy-feely spiritual qualities.
p208
aVIt's a thought in my brain, but at the same time,
p209
aVit's busy secreting acetylcholine
p210
aVand doing all sorts of other things
p211
aVas it makes its way from the motor cortex
p212
aVdown through the nerve fibers in the arm.
p213
aVNow, what that tells us is that our traditional vocabularies
p214
aVfor discussing these issues are totally obsolete.
p215
aVOne and the same event has a level of description
p216
aVwhere it's neurobiological, and another level of description
p217
aVwhere it's mental, and that's a single event,
p218
aVand that's how nature works. That's how it's possible
p219
aVfor consciousness to function causally.
p220
aVOkay, now with that in mind,
p221
aVwith going through these various features of consciousness,
p222
aVlet's go back and answer some of those early objections.
p223
aVWell, the first one I said was, consciousness doesn't exist,
p224
aVit's an illusion. Well, I've already answered that.
p225
aVI don't think we need to worry about that.
p226
aVBut the second one had an incredible influence,
p227
aVand may still be around, and that is,
p228
aV"Well, if consciousness exists, it's really something else.
p229
aVIt's really a digital computer program running in your brain
p230
aVand that's what we need to do to create consciousness
p231
aVis get the right program.
p232
aVYeah, forget about the hardware. Any hardware will do
p233
aVprovided it's rich enough and stable enough to carry the program."
p234
aVNow, we know that that's wrong.
p235
aVI mean, anybody who's thought about computers at all
p236
aVcan see that that's wrong, because computation
p237
aVis defined as symbol manipulation,
p238
aVusually thought of as zeros as ones, but any symbols will do.
p239
aVYou get an algorithm that you can program
p240
aVin a binary code, and that's the defining trait
p241
aVof the computer program.
p242
aVBut we know that that's purely syntactical. That's symbolic.
p243
aVWe know that actual human consciousness has something more than that.
p244
aVIt's got a content in addition to the syntax.
p245
aVIt's got a semantics.
p246
aVNow that argument, I made that argument 30 \u2014
p247
aVoh my God, I don't want to think about it \u2014
p248
aVmore than 30 years ago,
p249
aVbut there's a deeper argument implicit in what I've told you,
p250
aVand I want to tell you that argument briefly, and that is,
p251
aVconsciousness creates an observer-independent reality.
p252
aVIt creates a reality of money, property, government,
p253
aVmarriage, CERN conferences,
p254
aVcocktail parties and summer vacations,
p255
aVand all of those are creations of consciousness.
p256
aVTheir existence is observer-relative.
p257
aVIt's only relative to conscious agents that a piece of paper
p258
aVis money or that a bunch of buildings is a university.
p259
aVNow, ask yourself about computation.
p260
aVIs that absolute, like force and mass and gravitational attraction?
p261
aVOr is it observer-relative?
p262
aVWell, some computations are intrinsic.
p263
aVI add two plus two to get four.
p264
aVThat's going on no matter what anybody thinks.
p265
aVBut when I haul out my pocket calculator
p266
aVand do the calculation, the only intrinsic phenomenon
p267
aVis the electronic circuit and its behavior.
p268
aVThat's the only absolute phenomenon.
p269
aVAll the rest is interpreted by us.
p270
aVComputation only exists relative to consciousness.
p271
aVEither a conscious agent is carrying out the computation,
p272
aVor he's got a piece of machinery that admits of a computational interpretation.
p273
aVNow that doesn't mean computation is arbitrary.
p274
aVI spent a lot of money on this hardware.
p275
aVBut we have this persistent confusion
p276
aVbetween objectivity and subjectivity as features of reality
p277
aVand objectivity and subjectivity as features of claims.
p278
aVAnd the bottom line of this part of my talk is this:
p279
aVYou can have a completely objective science,
p280
aVa science where you make objectively true claims,
p281
aVabout a domain whose existence is subjective,
p282
aVwhose existence is in the human brain
p283
aVconsisting of subjective states of sentience
p284
aVor feeling or awareness.
p285
aVSo the objection that you can't have an objective science of consciousness
p286
aVbecause it's subjective and science is objective, that's a pun.
p287
aVThat's a bad pun on objectivity and subjectivity.
p288
aVYou can make objective claims
p289
aVabout a domain that is subjective in its mode of existence,
p290
aVand indeed that's what neurologists do.
p291
aVI mean, you have patients that actually suffer pains,
p292
aVand you try to get an objective science of that.
p293
aVOkay, I promised to refute all these guys,
p294
aVand I don't have an awful lot of time left,
p295
aVbut let me refute a couple more of them.
p296
aVI said that behaviorism ought to be
p297
aVone of the great embarrassments of our intellectual culture,
p298
aVbecause it's refuted the moment you think about it.
p299
aVYour mental states are identical with your behavior?
p300
aVWell, think about the distinction between feeling a pain
p301
aVand engaging in pain behavior.
p302
aVI won't demonstrate pain behavior, but I can tell you
p303
aVI'm not having any pains right now.
p304
aVSo it's an obvious mistake. Why did they make the mistake?
p305
aVThe mistake was \u2014 and you can go back and read
p306
aVthe literature on this, you can see this over and over \u2014
p307
aVthey think if you accept the irreducible existence
p308
aVof consciousness, you're giving up on science.
p309
aVYou're giving up on 300 years of human progress
p310
aVand human hope and all the rest of it.
p311
aVAnd the message I want to leave you with is,
p312
aVconsciousness has to become accepted
p313
aVas a genuine biological phenomenon,
p314
aVas much subject to scientific analysis
p315
aVas any other phenomenon in biology,
p316
aVor, for that matter, the rest of science.
p317
aVThank you very much.
