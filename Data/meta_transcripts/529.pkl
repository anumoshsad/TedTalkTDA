VSo the first question is, why do we need to
p4
aVeven worry about a pandemic threat?
p5
aVWhat is it that we're concerned about?
p6
aVWhen I say "we," I'm at the Council on Foreign Relations.
p7
aVWe're concerned in the national security community,
p8
aVand of course in the biology community and the public health community.
p9
aVWhile globalization has increased travel,
p10
aVit's made it necessary that everybody be everywhere,
p11
aVall the time, all over the world.
p12
aVAnd that means that your microbial hitchhikers are moving with you.
p13
aVSo a plague outbreak in Surat, India
p14
aVbecomes not an obscure event, but a globalized event \u2014
p15
aVa globalized concern that has changed the risk equation.
p16
aVKatrina showed us
p17
aVthat we cannot completely depend on government
p18
aVto have readiness in hand, to be capable of handling things.
p19
aVIndeed, an outbreak would be multiple Katrinas at once.
p20
aa(lp21
VOur big concern at the moment is a virus called H5N1 flu \u2014
p22
aVsome of you call it bird flu \u2014
p23
aVwhich first emerged in southern China, in the mid-1990s,
p24
aVbut we didn't know about it until 1997.
p25
aVAt the end of last Christmas only 13 countries had seen H5N1.
p26
aVBut we're now up to 55 countries in the world,
p27
aVhave had this virus emerge,
p28
aVin either birds, or people or both.
p29
aVIn the bird outbreaks we now can see
p30
aVthat pretty much the whole world has seen this virus
p31
aVexcept the Americas.
p32
aVAnd I'll get into why we've so far been spared in a moment.
p33
aa(lp34
VIn domestic birds, especially chickens,
p35
aVit's 100 percent lethal.
p36
aVIt's one of the most lethal things we've seen
p37
aVin circulation in the world
p38
aVin any recent centuries.
p39
aVAnd we've dealt with it by killing off lots and lots and lots of chickens,
p40
aVand unfortunately often not reimbursing the peasant farmers
p41
aVwith the result that there's cover-up.
p42
aVIt's also carried on migration patterns
p43
aVof wild migratory aquatic birds.
p44
aVThere has been this centralized event
p45
aVin a place called Lake Chenghai, China.
p46
aVTwo years ago the migrating birds
p47
aVhad a multiple event
p48
aVwhere thousands died because of a mutation occurring
p49
aVin the virus,
p50
aVwhich made the species range broaden dramatically.
p51
aVSo that birds going to Siberia, to Europe, and to Africa
p52
aVcarried the virus, which had not previously been possible.
p53
aa(lp54
VWe're now seeing outbreaks in human populations \u2014
p55
aVso far, fortunately, small events,
p56
aVtiny outbreaks, occasional clusters.
p57
aVThe virus has mutated dramatically in the last two years
p58
aVto form two distinct families, if you will,
p59
aVof the H5N1 viral tree
p60
aVwith branches in them,
p61
aVand with different attributes that are worrying.
p62
aVSo what's concerning us? Well, first of all,
p63
aVat no time in history have we succeeded in making
p64
aVin a timely fashion, a specific vaccine
p65
aVfor more than 260 million people.
p66
aVIt's not going to do us very much good in a global pandemic.
p67
aVYou've heard about the vaccine we're stockpiling.
p68
aVBut nobody believes it will actually be particularly effective
p69
aVif we have a real outbreak.
p70
aa(lp71
VSo one thought is:
p72
aVafter 9/11, when the airports closed,
p73
aVour flu season was delayed by two weeks.
p74
aVSo the thought is, hey, maybe what we should do is just
p75
aVimmediately \u2014 we hear there is H5N1 spreading from human to human,
p76
aVthe virus has mutated to be a human-to-human transmitter \u2014
p77
aVlet's shut down the airports.
p78
aVHowever, huge supercomputer analyses,
p79
aVdone of the likely effectiveness of this,
p80
aVshow that it won't buy us much time at all.
p81
aVAnd of course it will be hugely disruptive in preparation plans.
p82
aVFor example, all masks are made in China.
p83
aVHow do you get them mobilized around the world
p84
aVif you've shut all the airports down?
p85
aVHow do you get the vaccines moved around the world
p86
aVand the drugs moved, and whatever may or not be available that would work.
p87
aVSo it turns out that shutting down the airports is counterproductive.
p88
aa(lp89
VWe're worried because this virus, unlike any other flu
p90
aVwe've ever studied, can be transmitted by eating raw meat
p91
aVof the infected animals.
p92
aVWe've seen transmission to wild cats and domestic cats,
p93
aVand now also domestic pet dogs.
p94
aVAnd in experimental feedings to rodents and ferrets,
p95
aVwe found that the animals exhibit symptoms never seen with flu:
p96
aVseizures, central nervous system disorders, partial paralysis.
p97
aVThis is not your normal garden-variety flu.
p98
aVIt mimics what we now understand
p99
aVabout reconstructing the 1918 flu virus,
p100
aVthe last great pandemic,
p101
aVin that it also jumped directly from birds to people.
p102
aVWe had evolution over time,
p103
aVand this unbelievable mortality rate in human beings:
p104
aV55 percent of people who have become infected
p105
aVwith H5N1 have, in fact, succumbed.
p106
aVAnd we don't have a huge number of people
p107
aVwho got infected and never developed disease.
p108
aa(lp109
VIn experimental feeding in monkeys
p110
aVyou can see that it actually downregulates
p111
aVa specific immune system modulator.
p112
aVThe result is that what kills you
p113
aVis not the virus directly, but your own immune system overreacting, saying,
p114
aV"Whatever this is so foreign I'm going berserk."
p115
aVThe result: most of the deaths
p116
aVhave been in people under 30 years of age,
p117
aVrobustly healthy young adults.
p118
aVWe have seen human-to-human transmission
p119
aVin at least three clusters \u2014
p120
aVfortunately involving very intimate contact,
p121
aVstill not putting the world at large at any kind of risk.
p122
aa(lp123
VAlright, so I've got you nervous.
p124
aVNow you probably assume, well the governments are going to do something.
p125
aVAnd we have spent a lot of money.
p126
aVMost of the spending in the Bush administration
p127
aVhas actually been more related to the anthrax results
p128
aVand bio-terrorism threat.
p129
aVBut a lot of money has been thrown out at the local level and at the federal level
p130
aVto look at infectious diseases.
p131
aVEnd result: only 15 states
p132
aVhave been certified to be able to do mass distribution
p133
aVof vaccine and drugs in a pandemic.
p134
aVHalf the states would run out of hospital beds
p135
aVin the first week, maybe two weeks.
p136
aVAnd 40 states already have an acute nursing shortage.
p137
aVAdd on pandemic threat, you're in big trouble.
p138
aa(lp139
VSo what have people been doing with this money?
p140
aVExercises, drills, all over the world.
p141
aVLet's pretend there's a pandemic.
p142
aVLet's everybody run around and play your role.
p143
aVMain result is that there is tremendous confusion.
p144
aVMost of these people don't actually know what their job will be.
p145
aVAnd the bottom line, major thing that has come through
p146
aVin every single drill: nobody knows who's in charge.
p147
aVNobody knows the chain of command.
p148
aVIf it were Los Angeles, is it the mayor, the governor,
p149
aVthe President of the United States, the head of Homeland Security?
p150
aVIn fact, the federal government says it's a guy called
p151
aVthe Principle Federal Officer,
p152
aVwho happens to be with TSA.
p153
aa(lp154
VThe government says
p155
aVthe federal responsibility will basically be
p156
aVabout trying to keep the virus out, which we all know is impossible,
p157
aVand then to mitigate the impact
p158
aVprimarily on our economy.
p159
aVThe rest is up to your local community.
p160
aVEverything is about your town, where you live.
p161
aVWell how good a city council you have,
p162
aVhow good a mayor you have \u2014 that's who's going to be in charge.
p163
aVMost local facilities would all be competing
p164
aVto try and get their hands on their piece
p165
aVof the federal stockpile of a drug called Tamiflu,
p166
aVwhich may or may not be helpful \u2014 I'll get into that \u2014
p167
aVof available vaccines, and any other treatments,
p168
aVand masks, and anything that's been stockpiled.
p169
aVAnd you'll have massive competition.
p170
aVNow we did purchase a vaccine, you've probably all heard about it,
p171
aVmade by Sanofi-Aventis.
p172
aVUnfortunately it's made against the current form of H5N1.
p173
aVWe know the virus will mutate. It will be a different virus.
p174
aVThe vaccine will probably be useless.
p175
aVSo here's where the decisions come in.
p176
aa(lp177
VYou're the mayor of your local town.
p178
aVLet's see, should we order that all pets be kept indoors?
p179
aVGermany did that when H5N1 appeared in Germany last year,
p180
aVin order to minimize the spread
p181
aVbetween households by household cats, dogs and so on.
p182
aVWhat do we do when we don't have any containment rooms
p183
aVwith reverse air that will allow the healthcare workers
p184
aVto take care of patients?
p185
aVThese are in Hong Kong; we have nothing like that here.
p186
aVWhat about quarantine?
p187
aVDuring the SARS epidemic in Beijing quarantine did seem to help.
p188
aVWe have no uniform policies
p189
aVregarding quarantine across the United States.
p190
aVAnd some states have differential policies, county by county.
p191
aVBut what about the no-brainer things? Should we close all the schools?
p192
aVWell then what about all the workers? They won't go to work
p193
aVif their kids aren't in school.
p194
aVEncouraging telecommuting? What works?
p195
aa(lp196
VWell the British government did a model of telecommuting.
p197
aVSix weeks they had all people in the banking industry
p198
aVpretend a pandemic was underway.
p199
aVWhat they found was, the core functions \u2014
p200
aVyou know you still sort of had banks,
p201
aVbut you couldn't get people to put money in the ATM machines.
p202
aVNobody was processing the credit cards.
p203
aVYour insurance payments didn't go through.
p204
aVAnd basically the economy would be in a disaster state of affairs.
p205
aVAnd that's just office workers, bankers.
p206
aa(lp207
VWe don't know how important hand washing is for flu \u2014
p208
aVshocking. One assumes it's a good idea to wash your hands a lot.
p209
aVBut actually in scientific community there is great debate
p210
aVabout what percentage of flu transmission between people
p211
aVis from sneezing and coughing
p212
aVand what percentage is on your hands.
p213
aVThe Institute of Medicine tried to look at the masking question.
p214
aVCan we figure out a way, since we know we won't have enough masks
p215
aVbecause we don't make them in America anymore,
p216
aVthey're all made in China \u2014
p217
aVdo we need N95? A state-of-the-art, top-of-the-line,
p218
aVmust-be-fitted-to-your-face mask?
p219
aVOr can we get away with some different kinds of masks?
p220
aVIn the SARS epidemic, we learned in Hong Kong
p221
aVthat most of transmission was because
p222
aVpeople were removing their masks improperly.
p223
aVAnd their hand got contaminated with the outside of the mask,
p224
aVand then they rubbed their nose. Bingo! They got SARS.
p225
aVIt wasn't flying microbes.
p226
aVIf you go online right now, you'll get so much phony-baloney information.
p227
aVYou'll end up buying \u2014 this is called an N95 mask. Ridiculous.
p228
aVWe don't actually have a standard
p229
aVfor what should be the protective gear for the first responders,
p230
aVthe people who will actually be there on the front lines.
p231
aa(lp232
VAnd Tamiflu. You've probably heard of this drug,
p233
aVmade by Hoffmann-La Roche, patented drug.
p234
aVThere is some indication
p235
aVthat it may buy you some time in the midst of an outbreak.
p236
aVShould you take Tamiflu for a long period of time,
p237
aVwell, one of the side effects is suicidal ideations.
p238
aVA public health survey analyzed the effect
p239
aVthat large-scale Tamiflu use would have,
p240
aVactually shows it counteractive
p241
aVto public health measures, making matters worse.
p242
aVAnd here is the other interesting thing:
p243
aVwhen a human being ingests Tamiflu, only 20 percent
p244
aVis metabolized appropriately
p245
aVto be an active compound in the human being.
p246
aVThe rest turns into a stable compound,
p247
aVwhich survives filtration into the water systems,
p248
aVthereby exposing the very aquatic birds that would carry flu
p249
aVand providing them a chance
p250
aVto breed resistant strains.
p251
aVAnd we now have seen Tamiflu-resistant strains
p252
aVin both Vietnam in person-to-person transmission,
p253
aVand in Egypt in person-to-person transmission.
p254
aVSo I personally think that our life expectancy
p255
aVfor Tamiflu as an effective drug
p256
aVis very limited \u2014 very limited indeed.
p257
aa(lp258
VNevertheless most of the governments
p259
aVhave based their whole flu policies
p260
aVon building stockpiles of Tamiflu.
p261
aVRussia has actually stockpiled enough
p262
aVfor 95 percent of all Russians.
p263
aVWe've stockpiled enough for 30 percent.
p264
aVWhen I say enough, that's two weeks worth.
p265
aVAnd then you're on your own because
p266
aVthe pandemic is going to last for 18 to 24 months.
p267
aVSome of the poorer countries
p268
aVthat have had the most experience with H5N1 have built up stockpiles;
p269
aVthey're already expired. They are already out of date.
p270
aVWhat do we know from 1918,
p271
aVthe last great pandemic?
p272
aVThe federal government abdicated most responsibility.
p273
aVAnd so we ended up with this wild patchwork of regulations
p274
aVall over America.
p275
aVEvery city, county, state did their own thing.
p276
aVAnd the rules
p277
aVand the belief systems were wildly disparate.
p278
aVIn some cases all schools, all churches,
p279
aVall public venues were closed.
p280
aa(lp281
VThe pandemic circulated three times in 18 months
p282
aVin the absence of commercial air travel.
p283
aVThe second wave was the mutated, super-killer wave.
p284
aVAnd in the first wave we had enough healthcare workers.
p285
aVBut by the time the second wave hit
p286
aVit took such a toll among the healthcare workers
p287
aVthat we lost most of our doctors and nurses that were on the front lines.
p288
aVOverall we lost 700,000 people.
p289
aVThe virus was 100 percent lethal to pregnant women
p290
aVand we don't actually know why.
p291
aVMost of the death toll was 15 to 40 year-olds \u2014
p292
aVrobustly healthy young adults.
p293
aVIt was likened to the plague.
p294
aVWe don't actually know how many people died.
p295
aVThe low-ball estimate is 35 million.
p296
aVThis was based on European and North American data.
p297
aa(lp298
VA new study by Chris Murray at Harvard
p299
aVshows that if you look at the databases that were kept
p300
aVby the Brits in India,
p301
aVthere was a 31-fold greater death rate among the Indians.
p302
aVSo there is a strong belief that in places of poverty
p303
aVthe death toll was far higher.
p304
aVAnd that a more likely toll
p305
aVis somewhere in the neighborhood of 80 to 100 million people
p306
aVbefore we had commercial air travel.
p307
aVSo are we ready?
p308
aVAs a nation, no we're not.
p309
aVAnd I think even those in the leadership
p310
aVwould say that is the case,
p311
aVthat we still have a long ways to go.
p312
aa(lp313
VSo what does that mean for you? Well the first thing is,
p314
aVI wouldn't start building up personal stockpiles of anything \u2014
p315
aVfor yourself, your family, or your employees \u2014
p316
aVunless you've really done your homework.
p317
aVWhat mask works, what mask doesn't work.
p318
aVHow many masks do you need?
p319
aVThe Institute of Medicine study felt that
p320
aVyou could not recycle masks.
p321
aVWell if you think it's going to last 18 months,
p322
aVare you going to buy 18 months worth of masks
p323
aVfor every single person in your family?
p324
aa(lp325
VWe don't know \u2014 again with Tamiflu,
p326
aVthe number one side effect of Tamiflu is
p327
aVflu-like symptoms.
p328
aVSo then how can you tell
p329
aVwho in your family has the flu
p330
aVif everybody is taking Tamiflu?
p331
aVIf you expand that out to think of a whole community,
p332
aVor all your employees in your company,
p333
aVyou begin to realize how limited
p334
aVthe Tamiflu option might be.
p335
aVEverybody has come up to me and said,
p336
aVwell I'll stockpile water or, I'll stockpile food, or what have you.
p337
aVBut really? Do you really have a place
p338
aVto stockpile 18 months worth of food? Twenty-four months worth of food?
p339
aVDo you want to view the pandemic threat
p340
aVthe way back in the 1950s
p341
aVpeople viewed the civil defense issue,
p342
aVand build your own little bomb shelter for pandemic flu?
p343
aVI don't think that's rational.
p344
aa(lp345
VI think it's about having to be prepared
p346
aVas communities, not as individuals \u2014
p347
aVbeing prepared as nation,
p348
aVbeing prepared as state, being prepared as town.
p349
aVAnd right now most of the preparedness
p350
aVis deeply flawed.
p351
aVAnd I hope I've convinced you of that,
p352
aVwhich means that the real job is go out and
p353
aVsay to your local leaders,
p354
aVand your national leaders,
p355
aV"Why haven't you solved these problems?
p356
aVWhy are you still thinking that
p357
aVthe lessons of Katrina do not apply to flu?"
p358
aVAnd put the pressure where the pressure needs to be put.
p359
aVBut I guess the other thing to add is,
p360
aVif you do have employees, and you do have a company,
p361
aVI think you have certain responsibilities
p362
aVto demonstrate that you are thinking ahead for them,
p363
aVand you are trying to plan.
p364
aVAt a minimum the British banking plan showed that
p365
aVtelecommuting can be helpful.
p366
aVIt probably does reduce exposure
p367
aVbecause people are not coming into the office and coughing on each other,
p368
aVor touching common objects
p369
aVand sharing things via their hands.
p370
aVBut can you sustain your company that way?
p371
aVWell if you have a dot-com, maybe you can.
p372
aVOtherwise you're in trouble.
p373
aVHappy to take your questions.
p374
aV(Applause)
p375
aa(lp376
VAudience member: What factors determine the duration of a pandemic?
p377
aa(lp378
VLaurie Garret: What factors determine the duration of a pandemic, we don't really know.
p379
aVI could give you a bunch of flip, this, that, and the other.
p380
aVBut I would say that honestly we don't know.
p381
aVClearly the bottom line is
p382
aVthe virus eventually attenuates,
p383
aVand ceases to be a lethal virus to humanity,
p384
aVand finds other hosts.
p385
aVBut we don't really know how and why that happens.
p386
aVIt's a very complicated ecology.
p387
aa(lp388
VAudience member: What kind of triggers are you looking for?
p389
aVYou know way more than any of us.
p390
aVTo say ahh, if this happens then we are going to have a pandemic?
p391
aa(lp392
VLG: The moment that you see any evidence
p393
aVof serious human-to-human to transmission.
p394
aVNot just intimately between family members
p395
aVwho took care of an ailing sister or brother,
p396
aVbut a community infected \u2014
p397
aVspread within a school,
p398
aVspread within a dormitory, something of that nature.
p399
aVThen I think that there is universal agreement
p400
aVnow, at WHO all the way down:
p401
aVSend out the alert.
p402
aa(lp403
VAudience member: Some research has indicated that statins can be helpful.
p404
aVCan you talk about that?
p405
aa(lp406
VLG: Yeah. There is some evidence that taking Lipitor
p407
aVand other common statins for cholesterol control
p408
aVmay decrease your vulnerability
p409
aVto influenza.
p410
aVBut we do not completely understand why.
p411
aVThe mechanism isn't clear.
p412
aVAnd I don't know that there is any way
p413
aVresponsibly for someone to start
p414
aVmedicating their children
p415
aVwith their personal supply of Lipitor or something of that nature.
p416
aVWe have absolutely no idea what that would do.
p417
aVYou might be causing some very dangerous outcomes
p418
aVin your children, doing such a thing.
p419
aa(lp420
VAudience member: How far along are we in being able to determine
p421
aVwhether someone is actually carrying, whether somebody has this
p422
aVbefore the symptoms are full-blown?
p423
aa(lp424
VLG: Right. So I have for a long time said
p425
aVthat what we really needed was a rapid diagnostic.
p426
aVAnd our Centers for Disease Control
p427
aVhas labeled a test they developed
p428
aVa rapid diagnostic.
p429
aVIt takes 24 hours in a very highly developed laboratory,
p430
aVin highly skilled hands.
p431
aVI'm thinking dipstick.
p432
aVYou could do it to your own kid. It changes color.
p433
aVIt tells you if you have H5N1.
p434
aVIn terms of where we are in science
p435
aVwith DNA identification capacities and so on,
p436
aVit's not that far off.

aVBut we're not there. And there hasn't been the kind of investment to get us there.

VAudience member: In the 1918 flu I understand that
p440
aVthey theorized that there was some attenuation
p441
aVof the virus when it made the leap into humans.
p442
aVIs that likely, do you think, here?
p443
aVI mean 100 percent death rate
p444
aVis pretty severe.
p445
aa(lp446
VLG: Um yeah. So we don't actually know
p447
aVwhat the lethality was
p448
aVof the 1918 strain to wild birds
p449
aVbefore it jumped from birds to humans.
p450
aVIt's curious that there is no evidence
p451
aVof mass die-offs of chickens
p452
aVor household birds across America
p453
aVbefore the human pandemic happened.
p454
aVThat may be because those events
p455
aVwere occurring on the other side of the world
p456
aVwhere nobody was paying attention.
p457
aVBut the virus clearly
p458
aVwent through one round around the world
p459
aVin a mild enough form
p460
aVthat the British army in World War I
p461
aVactually certified that it was not a threat
p462
aVand would not affect the outcome of the war.
p463
aVAnd after circulating around the world
p464
aVcame back in a form that was tremendously lethal.
p465
aVWhat percentage of infected people were killed by it?
p466
aVAgain we don't really know for sure.
p467
aVIt's clear that if you were malnourished to begin with,
p468
aVyou had a weakened immune system,
p469
aVyou lived in poverty in India or Africa,
p470
aVyour likelihood of dying was far greater.
p471
aVBut we don't really know.
p472
aa(lp473
VAudience member: One of the things I've heard is that
p474
aVthe real death cause when you get a flu is the associated pneumonia,
p475
aVand that a pneumonia vaccine
p476
aVmay offer you 50 percent better chance of survival.
p477
aa(lp478
VLG: For a long time, researchers in emerging diseases
p479
aVwere kind of dismissive of the pandemic flu threat
p480
aVon the grounds that
p481
aVback in 1918 they didn't have antibiotics.
p482
aVAnd that most people who die of regular flu \u2014
p483
aVwhich in regular flu years
p484
aVis about 360,000 people worldwide,
p485
aVmost of them senior citizens \u2014
p486
aVand they die not of the flu but because the flu gives an assault to their immune system.
p487
aVAnd along comes pneumococcus
p488
aVor another bacteria, streptococcus
p489
aVand boom, they get a bacterial pneumonia.
p490
aVBut it turns out that in 1918 that was not the case at all.
p491
aVAnd so far in the H5N1 cases in people,
p492
aVsimilarly bacterial infection
p493
aVhas not been an issue at all.
p494
aVIt's this absolutely phenomenal disruption of the immune system
p495
aVthat is the key to why people die of this virus.
p496
aa(lp497
VAnd I would just add
p498
aVwe saw the same thing with SARS.
p499
aVSo what's going on here is your body says,
p500
aVyour immune system sends out all its sentinels and says,
p501
aV"I don't know what the heck this is.
p502
aVWe've never seen anything even remotely like this before."
p503
aVIt won't do any good to bring in the sharpshooters
p504
aVbecause those antibodies aren't here.
p505
aVAnd it won't do any good to bring in the tanks and the artillery
p506
aVbecause those T-cells don't recognize it either.
p507
aVSo we're going to have to go all-out thermonuclear response,
p508
aVstimulate the total cytokine cascade.
p509
aVThe whole immune system swarms into the lungs.
p510
aVAnd yes they die, drowning in their own fluids, of pneumonia.
p511
aVBut it's not bacterial pneumonia.
p512
aVAnd it's not a pneumonia that would respond to a vaccine.
p513
aVAnd I think my time is up. I thank you all for your attention.
