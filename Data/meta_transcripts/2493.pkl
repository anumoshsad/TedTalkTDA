VDesign is a slippery and elusive phenomenon,
p4
aVwhich has meant different things at different times.
p5
aVBut all truly inspiring design projects have one thing in common:
p6
aVthey began with a dream.
p7
aVAnd the bolder the dream,
p8
aVthe greater the design feat that will be required to achieve it.
p9
aVAnd this is why the greatest designers are almost always
p10
aVthe biggest dreamers and rebels and renegades.
p11
aa(lp12
VThis has been the case throughout history,
p13
aVall the way back to the year 300 BC,
p14
aVwhen a 13-year-old became the king
p15
aVof a remote, very poor and very small Asian country.
p16
aVHe dreamt of acquiring land, riches and power
p17
aVthrough military conquest.
p18
aVAnd his design skills \u2014
p19
aVimprobable though it sounds \u2014
p20
aVwould be essential in enabling him to do so.
p21
aa(lp22
VAt the time,
p23
aVall weapons were made by hand to different specifications.
p24
aVSo if an archer ran out of arrows during a battle,
p25
aVthey wouldn't necessarily be able to fire another archer's arrows
p26
aVfrom their bow.
p27
aVThis of course meant that they would be less effective in combat
p28
aVand very vulnerable, too.
p29
aVYing solved this problem
p30
aVby insisting that all bows and arrows were designed identically,
p31
aVso they were interchangeable.
p32
aVAnd he did the same for daggers, axes, spears, shields
p33
aVand every other form of weaponry.
p34
aVHis formidably equipped army won batter after battle,
p35
aVand within 15 years,
p36
aVhis tiny kingdom had succeeded in conquering
p37
aVall its larger, richer, more powerful neighbors,
p38
aVto found the mighty Chinese Empire.
p39
aa(lp40
VNow, no one, of course,
p41
aVwould have thought of describing Ying Zheng as a designer at the time \u2014
p42
aVwhy would they?
p43
aVAnd yet he used design unknowingly and instinctively
p44
aVbut with tremendous ingenuity
p45
aVto achieve his ends.
p46
aVAnd so did another equally improbable, accidental designer,
p47
aVwho was also not above using violence to get what he wanted.
p48
aVThis was Edward Teach, better known as the British pirate, Blackbeard.
p49
aa(lp50
VThis was the golden age of piracy,
p51
aVwhere pirates like Teach were terrorizing the high seas.
p52
aVColonial trade was flourishing,
p53
aVand piracy was highly profitable.
p54
aVAnd the smarter pirates like him realized that to maximize their spoils,
p55
aVthey needed to attack their enemies so brutally
p56
aVthat they would surrender on sight.
p57
aVSo in other words,
p58
aVthey could take the ships without wasting ammunition,
p59
aVor incurring casualties.
p60
aa(lp61
VSo Edward Teach redesigned himself as Blackbeard
p62
aVby playing the part of a merciless brute.
p63
aVHe wore heavy jackets and big hats to accentuate his height.
p64
aVHe grew the bushy black beard that obscured his face.
p65
aVHe slung braces of pistols on either shoulder.
p66
aVHe even attached matches to the brim of his hat and set them alight,
p67
aVso they sizzled menacingly whenever his ship was poised to attack.
p68
aVAnd like many pirates of that era,
p69
aVhe flew a flag that bore the macabre symbols
p70
aVof a human skull and a pair of crossed bones,
p71
aVbecause those motifs had signified death in so many cultures for centuries,
p72
aVthat their meaning was instantly recognizable,
p73
aVeven in the lawless, illiterate world of the high seas:
p74
aVsurrender or you'll suffer.
p75
aVSo of course, all his sensible victims surrendered on sight.
p76
aa(lp77
VPut like that,
p78
aVit's easy to see why Edward Teach and his fellow pirates
p79
aVcould be seen as pioneers of modern communications design,
p80
aVand why their deadly symbol \u2014
p81
aa(lp82
V(Laughter)
p83
aa(lp84
Vthere's more \u2014
p85
aVwhy their deadly symbol of the skull and crossbones
p86
aVwas a precursor of today's logos,
p87
aVrather like the big red letters standing behind me,
p88
aVbut of course with a different message.
p89
aa(lp90
V(Laughter)
p91
aa(lp92
VYet design was also used to nobler ends
p93
aVby an equally brilliant and equally improbable designer,
p94
aVthe 19th-century British nurse, Florence Nightingale.
p95
aVHer mission was to provide decent healthcare for everyone.
p96
aVNightingale was born into a rather grand, very wealthy British family,
p97
aVwho were horrified when she volunteered to work in military hospitals
p98
aVduring the Crimean War.
p99
aVOnce there, she swiftly realized
p100
aVthat more patients were dying of infections that they caught there,
p101
aVin the filthy, fetid wards,
p102
aVthan they were of battle wounds.
p103
aVSo she campaigned for cleaner, lighter, airier clinics
p104
aVto be designed and built.
p105
aa(lp106
VBack in Britain,
p107
aVshe mounted another campaign,
p108
aVthis time for civilian hospitals,
p109
aVand insisted that the same design principles were applied to them.
p110
aVThe Nightingale ward, as it is called,
p111
aVdominated hospital design for decades to come,
p112
aVand elements of it are still used today.
p113
aVBut by then,
p114
aVdesign was seen as a tool of the Industrial Age.
p115
aVIt was formalized and professionalized,
p116
aVbut it was restricted to specific roles
p117
aVand generally applied in pursuit of commercial goals
p118
aVrather than being used intuitively,
p119
aVas Florence Nightingale, Blackbeard and Ying Zheng had done.
p120
aa(lp121
VBy the 20th century,
p122
aVthis commercial ethos was so powerful,
p123
aVthat any designers who deviated from it
p124
aVrisked being seen as cranks or subversives.
p125
aa(lp126
VNow among them is one of my great design heroes,
p127
aVthe brilliant László Moholy-Nagy.
p128
aVHe was the Hungarian artist and designer
p129
aVwhose experiments with the impact of technology on daily life
p130
aVwere so powerful
p131
aVthat they still influence the design of the digital images
p132
aVwe see on our phone and computer screens.
p133
aVHe radicalized the Bauhaus Design School in 1920s Germany,
p134
aVand yet some of his former colleagues shunned him
p135
aVwhen he struggled to open a new Bauhaus in Chicago years later.
p136
aVMoholy's ideas were as bold and incisive as ever,
p137
aVbut his approach to design was too experimental,
p138
aVas was his insistence on seeing it, as he put it,
p139
aVas an attitude, not a profession to be in tune with the times.
p140
aa(lp141
VAnd sadly, the same applied
p142
aVto another design maverick: Richard Buckminster Fuller.
p143
aVHe was yet another brilliant design visionary
p144
aVand design activist,
p145
aVwho was completely committed to designing a sustainable society
p146
aVin such a forward-thinking way
p147
aVthat he started talking about the importance of environmentalism
p148
aVin design in the 1920s.
p149
aVNow he, despite his efforts,
p150
aVwas routinely mocked as a crank by many in the design establishment,
p151
aVand admittedly,
p152
aVsome of his experiments failed,
p153
aVlike the flying car that never got off the ground.
p154
aVAnd yet, the geodesic dome,
p155
aVhis design formula to build an emergency shelter
p156
aVfrom scraps of wood, metal, plastic,
p157
aVbits of tree, old blankets, plastic sheeting \u2014
p158
aVjust about anything that's available at the time \u2014
p159
aVis one of the greatest feats of humanitarian design,
p160
aVand has provided sorely needed refuge
p161
aVto many, many people in desperate circumstances
p162
aVever since.
p163
aa(lp164
VNow, it was the courage and verve of radical designers
p165
aVlike Bucky and Moholy
p166
aVthat drew me to design.
p167
aVI began my career as a news journalist and foreign correspondent.
p168
aVI wrote about politics, economics and corporate affairs,
p169
aVand I could have chosen to specialize in any of those fields.
p170
aVBut I picked design,
p171
aVbecause I believe it's one of the most powerful tools at our disposal
p172
aVto improve our quality of life.
p173
aa(lp174
VThank you, fellow TED design buffs.
p175
aa(lp176
V(Applause)
p177
aa(lp178
VAnd greatly as I admire the achievements of professional designers,
p179
aVwhich have been extraordinary and immense,
p180
aVI also believe
p181
aVthat design benefits hugely from the originality,
p182
aVthe lateral thinking
p183
aVand the resourcefulness of its rebels and renegades.
p184
aVAnd we're living at a remarkable moment in design,
p185
aVbecause this is a time when the two camps are coming closer together.
p186
aVBecause even very basic advances in digital technology
p187
aVhave enabled them to operate increasingly independently,
p188
aVin or out of a commercial context,
p189
aVto pursue ever more ambitious and eclectic objectives.
p190
aa(lp191
VSo in theory,
p192
aVbasic platforms like crowdfunding, cloud computing, social media
p193
aVare giving greater freedom to professional designers
p194
aVand giving more resources for the improvisational ones,
p195
aVand hopefully,
p196
aVa more receptive response to their ideas.
p197
aa(lp198
VNow, some of my favorite examples of this are in Africa,
p199
aVwhere a new generation of designers
p200
aVare developing incredible Internet of Things technologies
p201
aVto fulfill Florence Nightingale's dream of improving healthcare
p202
aVin countries where more people now have access to cell phones
p203
aVthan to clean, running water.
p204
aa(lp205
VAnd among them is Arthur Zang.
p206
aVHe's a young, Cameroonian design engineer
p207
aVwho has a adapted a tablet computer into the Cardiopad,
p208
aVa mobile heart-monitoring device.
p209
aVIt can be used to monitor the hearts of patients in remote, rural areas.
p210
aVThe data is then sent on a cellular network
p211
aVto well-equipped hospitals hundreds of miles away
p212
aVfor analysis.
p213
aVAnd if any problems are spotted by the specialists there,
p214
aVa suitable course of treatment is recommended.
p215
aVAnd this of course saves many patients
p216
aVfrom making long, arduous, expensive and often pointless journeys
p217
aVto those hospitals,
p218
aVand makes it much, much likelier
p219
aVthat their hearts will actually be checked.
p220
aa(lp221
VArthur Zang started working on the Cardiopad eight years ago,
p222
aVin his final year at university.
p223
aVBut he failed to persuade any conventional sources
p224
aVto give him investment to get the project off the ground.
p225
aVHe posted the idea on Facebook,
p226
aVwhere a Cameroonian government official saw it
p227
aVand managed to secure a government grant for him.
p228
aVHe's now developing not only the Cardiopad,
p229
aVbut other mobile medical devices to treat different conditions.
p230
aa(lp231
VAnd he isn't alone,
p232
aVbecause there are many other inspiring and enterprising designers
p233
aVwho are also pursuing extraordinary projects of their own.
p234
aVAnd I'm going to finish by looking at just a few of them.
p235
aVOne is Peek Vision.
p236
aVThis is a group of doctors and designers in Kenya,
p237
aVwho've developed an Internet of Things technology of their own,
p238
aVas a portable eye examination kit.
p239
aVThen there's Gabriel Maher,
p240
aVwho is developing a new design language
p241
aVto enable us to articulate the subtleties of our changing gender identities,
p242
aVwithout recourse to traditional stereotypes.
p243
aa(lp244
VAll of these designers and many more are pursuing their dreams,
p245
aVby the making the most of their newfound freedom,
p246
aVwith the discipline of professional designers
p247
aVand the resourcefulness of rebels and renegades.
p248
aVAnd we all stand to benefit.
p249
aa(lp250
VThank you.
