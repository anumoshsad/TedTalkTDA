VWhat I'd like to talk about is really the biggest problems in the world.
p4
aVI'm not going to talk about "The Skeptical Environmentalist" \u2014
p5
aVprobably that's also a good choice.
p6
aV(Laughter)
p7
aa(lp8
VBut I am going talk about: what are the big problems in the world?
p9
aVAnd I must say, before I go on, I should ask every one of you
p10
aVto try and get out pen and paper
p11
aVbecause I'm actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that.
p12
aVSo get out your pen and paper.
p13
aVBottom line is, there is a lot of problems out there in the world.
p14
aVI'm just going to list some of them.
p15
aVThere are 800 million people starving.
p16
aVThere's a billion people without clean drinking water.
p17
aVTwo billion people without sanitation.
p18
aVThere are several million people dying of HIV and AIDS.
p19
aVThe lists go on and on.
p20
aVThere's two billions of people who will be severely affected by climate change \u2014 so on.
p21
aVThere are many, many problems out there.
p22
aa(lp23
VIn an ideal world, we would solve them all, but we don't.
p24
aVWe don't actually solve all problems.
p25
aVAnd if we do not, the question I think we need to ask ourselves \u2014
p26
aVand that's why it's on the economy session \u2014 is to say,
p27
aVif we don't do all things, we really have to start asking ourselves,
p28
aVwhich ones should we solve first?
p29
aVAnd that's the question I'd like to ask you.
p30
aVIf we had say, 50 billion dollars over the next four years to spend
p31
aVto do good in this world, where should we spend it?
p32
aVWe identified 10 of the biggest challenges in the world,
p33
aVand I will just briefly read them:
p34
aVclimate change, communicable diseases, conflicts, education,
p35
aVfinancial instability, governance and corruption,
p36
aVmalnutrition and hunger, population migration,
p37
aVsanitation and water, and subsidies and trade barriers.
p38
aVWe believe that these in many ways
p39
aVencompass the biggest problems in the world.
p40
aVThe obvious question would be to ask,
p41
aVwhat do you think are the biggest things?
p42
aVWhere should we start on solving these problems?
p43
aVBut that's a wrong problem to ask.
p44
aVThat was actually the problem that was asked in Davos in January.
p45
aa(lp46
VBut of course, there's a problem in asking people to focus on problems.
p47
aVBecause we can't solve problems.
p48
aVSurely the biggest problem we have in the world is that we all die.
p49
aVBut we don't have a technology to solve that, right?
p50
aVSo the point is not to prioritize problems,
p51
aVbut the point is to prioritize solutions to problems.
p52
aVAnd that would be \u2014 of course that gets a little more complicated.
p53
aVTo climate change that would be like Kyoto.
p54
aVTo communicable diseases, it might be health clinics or mosquito nets.
p55
aVTo conflicts, it would be U.N.'s peacekeeping forces, and so on.
p56
aVThe point that I would like to ask you to try to do,
p57
aVis just in 30 seconds \u2014 and I know this is in a sense
p58
aVan impossible task \u2014 write down what you think
p59
aVis probably some of the top priorities.
p60
aVAnd also \u2014 and that's, of course, where economics gets evil \u2014
p61
aVto put down what are the things we should not do, first.
p62
aVWhat should be at the bottom of the list?
p63
aVPlease, just take 30 seconds, perhaps talk to your neighbor,
p64
aVand just figure out what should be the top priorities
p65
aVand the bottom priorities of the solutions that we have
p66
aVto the world's biggest issues.
p67
aa(lp68
VThe amazing part of this process \u2014 and of course, I mean,
p69
aVI would love to \u2014 I only have 18 minutes,
p70
aVI've already given you quite a substantial amount of my time, right?
p71
aVI'd love to go into, and get you to think about this process,
p72
aVand that's actually what we did.
p73
aVAnd I also strongly encourage you,
p74
aVand I'm sure we'll also have these discussions afterwards,
p75
aVto think about, how do we actually prioritize?
p76
aVOf course, you have to ask yourself,
p77
aVwhy on Earth was such a list never done before?
p78
aVAnd one reason is that prioritization is incredibly uncomfortable.
p79
aVNobody wants to do this.
p80
aVOf course, every organization would love to be on the top of such a list.
p81
aVBut every organization would also hate to be not on the top of the list.
p82
aVAnd since there are many more not-number-one spots on the list
p83
aVthan there is number ones, it makes perfect sense
p84
aVnot to want to do such a list.
p85
aVWe've had the U.N. for almost 60 years,
p86
aVyet we've never actually made a fundamental list
p87
aVof all the big things that we can do in the world,
p88
aVand said, which of them should we do first?
p89
aVSo it doesn't mean that we are not prioritizing \u2014
p90
aVany decision is a prioritization, so of course we are still prioritizing,
p91
aVif only implicitly \u2014 and that's unlikely to be as good
p92
aVas if we actually did the prioritization,
p93
aVand went in and talked about it.
p94
aa(lp95
VSo what I'm proposing is really to say that we have,
p96
aVfor a very long time, had a situation when we've had a menu of choices.
p97
aVThere are many, many things we can do out there,
p98
aVbut we've not had the prices, nor the sizes.
p99
aVWe have not had an idea.
p100
aVImagine going into a restaurant and getting this big menu card,
p101
aVbut you have no idea what the price is.
p102
aVYou know, you have a pizza; you've no idea what the price is.
p103
aVIt could be at one dollar; it could be 1,000 dollars.
p104
aVIt could be a family-size pizza;
p105
aVit could be a very individual-size pizza, right?
p106
aVWe'd like to know these things.
p107
aa(lp108
VAnd that is what the Copenhagen Consensus is really trying to do \u2014
p109
aVto try to put prices on these issues.
p110
aVAnd so basically, this has been the Copenhagen Consensus' process.
p111
aVWe got 30 of the world's best economists, three in each area.
p112
aVSo we have three of world's top economists write about climate change.
p113
aVWhat can we do? What will be the cost
p114
aVand what will be the benefit of that?
p115
aVLikewise in communicable diseases.
p116
aVThree of the world's top experts saying, what can we do?
p117
aVWhat would be the price?
p118
aVWhat should we do about it, and what will be the outcome?
p119
aVAnd so on.
p120
aa(lp121
VThen we had some of the world's top economists,
p122
aVeight of the world's top economists, including three Nobel Laureates,
p123
aVmeet in Copenhagen in May 2004.
p124
aVWe called them the "dream team."
p125
aVThe Cambridge University prefects decided to call them
p126
aVthe Real Madrid of economics.
p127
aVThat works very well in Europe, but it doesn't really work over here.
p128
aVAnd what they basically did was come out with a prioritized list.
p129
aVAnd then you ask, why economists?
p130
aVAnd of course, I'm very happy you asked that question \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p131
aVbecause that's a very good question.
p132
aVThe point is, of course, if you want to know about malaria,
p133
aVyou ask a malaria expert.
p134
aVIf you want to know about climate, you ask a climatologist.
p135
aVBut if you want to know which of the two you should deal with first,
p136
aVyou can't ask either of them, because that's not what they do.
p137
aVThat is what economists do.
p138
aVThey prioritize.
p139
aVThey make that in some ways disgusting task of saying, which one should we do first,
p140
aVand which one should we do afterwards?
p141
aa(lp142
VSo this is the list, and this is the one I'd like to share with you.
p143
aVOf course, you can also see it on the website,
p144
aVand we'll also talk about it more, I'm sure, as the day goes on.
p145
aVThey basically came up with a list where they said
p146
aVthere were bad projects \u2014 basically, projects
p147
aVwhere if you invest a dollar, you get less than a dollar back.
p148
aVThen there's fair projects, good projects and very good projects.
p149
aVAnd of course, it's the very good projects we should start doing.
p150
aVI'm going to go from backwards
p151
aVso that we end up with the best projects.
p152
aa(lp153
VThese were the bad projects.
p154
aVAs you might see the bottom of the list was climate change.
p155
aVThis offends a lot of people, and that's probably one of the things
p156
aVwhere people will say I shouldn't come back, either.
p157
aVAnd I'd like to talk about that, because that's really curious.
p158
aVWhy is it it came up?
p159
aVAnd I'll actually also try to get back to this
p160
aVbecause it's probably one of the things
p161
aVthat we'll disagree with on the list that you wrote down.
p162
aa(lp163
VThe reason why they came up with saying that Kyoto \u2014
p164
aVor doing something more than Kyoto \u2014 is a bad deal
p165
aVis simply because it's very inefficient.
p166
aVIt's not saying that global warming is not happening.
p167
aVIt's not saying that it's not a big problem.
p168
aVBut it's saying that what we can do about it
p169
aVis very little, at a very high cost.
p170
aVWhat they basically show us, the average of all macroeconomic models,
p171
aVis that Kyoto, if everyone agreed, would cost about 150 billion dollars a year.
p172
aVThat's a substantial amount of money.
p173
aVThat's two to three times the global development aid
p174
aVthat we give the Third World every year.
p175
aVYet it would do very little good.
p176
aVAll models show it will postpone warming for about six years in 2100.
p177
aVSo the guy in Bangladesh who gets a flood in 2100 can wait until 2106.
p178
aVWhich is a little good, but not very much good.
p179
aVSo the idea here really is to say, well, we've spent a lot of money doing a little good.
p180
aa(lp181
VAnd just to give you a sense of reference,
p182
aVthe U.N. actually estimate that for half that amount,
p183
aVfor about 75 billion dollars a year,
p184
aVwe could solve all major basic problems in the world.
p185
aVWe could give clean drinking water, sanitation, basic healthcare
p186
aVand education to every single human being on the planet.
p187
aVSo we have to ask ourselves, do we want to spend twice the amount
p188
aVon doing very little good?
p189
aVOr half the amount on doing an amazing amount of good?
p190
aVAnd that is really why it becomes a bad project.
p191
aVIt's not to say that if we had all the money in the world, we wouldn't want to do it.
p192
aVBut it's to say, when we don't, it's just simply not our first priority.
p193
aa(lp194
VThe fair projects \u2014 notice I'm not going to comment on all these \u2014
p195
aVbut communicable diseases, scale of basic health services \u2014 just made it,
p196
aVsimply because, yes, scale of basic health services is a great thing.
p197
aVIt would do a lot of good, but it's also very, very costly.
p198
aVAgain, what it tells us is suddenly
p199
aVwe start thinking about both sides of the equation.
p200
aVIf you look at the good projects, a lot of sanitation and water projects came in.
p201
aVAgain, sanitation and water is incredibly important,
p202
aVbut it also costs a lot of infrastructure.
p203
aVSo I'd like to show you the top four priorities
p204
aVwhich should be at least the first ones that we deal with
p205
aVwhen we talk about how we should deal with the problems in the world.
p206
aa(lp207
VThe fourth best problem is malaria \u2014 dealing with malaria.
p208
aVThe incidence of malaria is about a couple of [million] people get infected every year.
p209
aVIt might even cost up towards a percentage point of GDP
p210
aVevery year for affected nations.
p211
aVIf we invested about 13 billion dollars over the next four years,
p212
aVwe could bring that incidence down to half.
p213
aVWe could avoid about 500,000 people dying,
p214
aVbut perhaps more importantly, we could avoid about a [million] people
p215
aVgetting infected every year.
p216
aVWe would significantly increase their ability
p217
aVto deal with many of the other problems that they have to deal with \u2014
p218
aVof course, in the long run, also to deal with global warming.
p219
aa(lp220
VThis third best one was free trade.
p221
aVBasically, the model showed that if we could get free trade,
p222
aVand especially cut subsidies in the U.S. and Europe,
p223
aVwe could basically enliven the global economy
p224
aVto an astounding number of about 2,400 billion dollars a year,
p225
aVhalf of which would accrue to the Third World.
p226
aVAgain, the point is to say that we could actually pull
p227
aVtwo to three hundred million people out of poverty,
p228
aVvery radically fast, in about two to five years.
p229
aVThat would be the third best thing we could do.
p230
aa(lp231
VThe second best thing would be to focus on malnutrition.
p232
aVNot just malnutrition in general, but there's a very cheap way
p233
aVof dealing with malnutrition, namely, the lack of micronutrients.
p234
aVBasically, about half of the world's population is lacking in
p235
aViron, zinc, iodine and vitamin A.
p236
aVIf we invest about 12 billion dollars,
p237
aVwe could make a severe inroad into that problem.
p238
aVThat would be the second best investment that we could do.
p239
aa(lp240
VAnd the very best project would be to focus on HIV/AIDS.
p241
aVBasically, if we invest 27 billion dollars over the next eight years,
p242
aVwe could avoid 28 new million cases of HIV/AIDS.
p243
aVAgain, what this does and what it focuses on is saying
p244
aVthere are two very different ways that we can deal with HIV/AIDS.
p245
aVOne is treatment; the other one is prevention.
p246
aVAnd again, in an ideal world, we would do both.
p247
aVBut in a world where we don't do either, or don't do it very well,
p248
aVwe have to at least ask ourselves where should we invest first.
p249
aVAnd treatment is much, much more expensive than prevention.
p250
aVSo basically, what this focuses on is saying, we can do a lot more
p251
aVby investing in prevention.
p252
aVBasically for the amount of money that we spend,
p253
aVwe can do X amount of good in treatment,
p254
aVand 10 times as much good in prevention.
p255
aVSo again, what we focus on is prevention rather than treatment,
p256
aVat first rate.
p257
aa(lp258
VWhat this really does is that it makes us think about our priorities.
p259
aVI'd like to have you look at your priority list and say,
p260
aVdid you get it right?
p261
aVOr did you get close to what we came up with here?
p262
aVWell, of course, one of the things is climate change again.
p263
aVI find a lot of people find it very, very unlikely that we should do that.
p264
aa(lp265
VWe should also do climate change,
p266
aVif for no other reason, simply because it's such a big problem.
p267
aVBut of course, we don't do all problems.
p268
aVThere are many problems out there in the world.
p269
aVAnd what I want to make sure of is, if we actually focus on problems,
p270
aVthat we focus on the right ones.
p271
aVThe ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good.
p272
aVAnd I think, actually \u2014 Thomas Schelling,
p273
aVone of the participants in the dream team, he put it very, very well.
p274
aVOne of things that people forget, is that in 100 years,
p275
aVwhen we're talking about most of the climate change impacts will be,
p276
aVpeople will be much, much richer.
p277
aVEven the most pessimistic impact scenarios of the U.N.
p278
aVestimate that the average person in the developing world in 2100
p279
aVwill be about as rich as we are today.
p280
aVMuch more likely, they will be two to four times richer than we are.
p281
aVAnd of course, we'll be even richer than that.
p282
aa(lp283
VBut the point is to say, when we talk about saving people,
p284
aVor helping people in Bangladesh in 2100,
p285
aVwe're not talking about a poor Bangladeshi.
p286
aVWe're actually talking about a fairly rich Dutch guy.
p287
aVAnd so the real point, of course, is to say,
p288
aVdo we want to spend a lot of money helping a little,
p289
aV100 years from now, a fairly rich Dutch guy?
p290
aVOr do we want to help real poor people, right now, in Bangladesh,
p291
aVwho really need the help, and whom we can help very, very cheaply?
p292
aVOr as Schelling put it, imagine if you were a rich \u2014 as you will be \u2014
p293
aVa rich Chinese, a rich Bolivian, a rich Congolese, in 2100,
p294
aVthinking back on 2005, and saying, "How odd that they cared so much
p295
aVabout helping me a little bit through climate change,
p296
aVand cared so fairly little about helping my grandfather
p297
aVand my great grandfather, whom they could have helped so much more,
p298
aVand who needed the help so much more?"
p299
aa(lp300
VSo I think that really does tell us why it is
p301
aVwe need to get our priorities straight.
p302
aVEven if it doesn't accord to the typical way we see this problem.
p303
aVOf course, that's mainly because climate change has good pictures.
p304
aVWe have, you know, "The Day After Tomorrow" \u2014 it looks great, right?
p305
aVIt's a good film in the sense that
p306
aVI certainly want to see it, right, but don't expect Emmerich
p307
aVto cast Brad Pitt in his next movie
p308
aVdigging latrines in Tanzania or something. (Laughter)
p309
aVIt just doesn't make for as much of a movie.
p310
aVSo in many ways, I think of the Copenhagen Consensus
p311
aVand the whole discussion of priorities
p312
aVas a defense for boring problems.
p313
aVTo make sure that we realize it's not about making us feel good.
p314
aVIt's not about making things that have the most media attention,
p315
aVbut it's about making places where we can actually do the most good.
p316
aa(lp317
VThe other objections, I think, that are important to say,
p318
aVis that I'm somehow \u2014 or we are somehow \u2014 positing a false choice.
p319
aVOf course, we should do all things,
p320
aVin an ideal world \u2014 I would certainly agree.
p321
aVI think we should do all things, but we don't.
p322
aVIn 1970, the developed world decided we were going to spend
p323
aVtwice as much as we did, right now, than in 1970, on the developing world.
p324
aVSince then our aid has halved.
p325
aVSo it doesn't look like we're actually on the path
p326
aVof suddenly solving all big problems.
p327
aa(lp328
VLikewise, people are also saying, but what about the Iraq war?
p329
aVYou know, we spend 100 billion dollars \u2014
p330
aVwhy don't we spend that on doing good in the world?
p331
aVI'm all for that.
p332
aVIf any one of you guys can talk Bush into doing that, that's fine.
p333
aVBut the point, of course, is still to say,
p334
aVif you get another 100 billion dollars,
p335
aVwe still want to spend that in the best possible way, don't we?
p336
aVSo the real issue here is to get ourselves back
p337
aVand think about what are the right priorities.
p338
aVI should just mention briefly, is this really the right list that we got out?
p339
aVYou know, when you ask the world's best economists,
p340
aVyou inevitably end up asking old, white American men.
p341
aVAnd they're not necessarily, you know,
p342
aVgreat ways of looking at the entire world.
p343
aa(lp344
VSo we actually invited 80 young people from all over the world
p345
aVto come and solve the same problem.
p346
aVThe only two requirements were that they were studying at the university,
p347
aVand they spoke English.
p348
aVThe majority of them were, first, from developing countries.
p349
aVThey had all the same material but they could go vastly
p350
aVoutside the scope of discussion, and they certainly did,
p351
aVto come up with their own lists.
p352
aVAnd the surprising thing was that the list was very similar \u2014
p353
aVwith malnutrition and diseases at the top
p354
aVand climate change at the bottom.
p355
aVWe've done this many other times.
p356
aVThere's been many other seminars and university students, and different things.
p357
aVThey all come out with very much the same list.
p358
aVAnd that gives me great hope, really, in saying that I do believe
p359
aVthat there is a path ahead to get us to start thinking about priorities,
p360
aVand saying, what is the important thing in the world?
p361
aVOf course, in an ideal world, again we'd love to do everything.
p362
aVBut if we don't do it, then we can start thinking about where should we start?
p363
aa(lp364
VI see the Copenhagen Consensus as a process.
p365
aVWe did it in 2004,
p366
aVand we hope to assemble many more people,
p367
aVgetting much better information for 2008, 2012.
p368
aVMap out the right path for the world \u2014
p369
aVbut also to start thinking about political triage.
p370
aVTo start thinking about saying, "Let's do
p371
aVnot the things where we can do very little at a very high cost,
p372
aVnot the things that we don't know how to do,
p373
aVbut let's do the great things where we can do an enormous
p374
aVamount of good, at very low cost, right now."
p375
aa(lp376
VAt the end of the day, you can disagree
p377
aVwith the discussion of how we actually prioritize these,
p378
aVbut we have to be honest and frank about saying,
p379
aVif there's some things we do, there are other things we don't do.
p380
aVIf we worry too much about some things,
p381
aVwe end by not worrying about other things.
p382
aVSo I hope this will help us make better priorities,
p383
aVand think about how we better work for the world.
p384
aVThank you.
