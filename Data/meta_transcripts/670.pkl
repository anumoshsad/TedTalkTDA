VOn the 30th of May, 1832,
p4
aVa gunshot was heard
p5
aVringing out across the 13th arrondissement in Paris.
p6
aV(Gunshot)
p7
aVA peasant, who was walking to market that morning,
p8
aVran towards where the gunshot had come from,
p9
aVand found a young man writhing in agony on the floor,
p10
aVclearly shot by a dueling wound.
p11
aVThe young man's name was Evariste Galois.
p12
aVHe was a well-known revolutionary in Paris at the time.
p13
aVGalois was taken to the local hospital
p14
aVwhere he died the next day in the arms of his brother.
p15
aVAnd the last words he said to his brother were,
p16
aV"Don't cry for me, Alfred.
p17
aVI need all the courage I can muster
p18
aVto die at the age of 20."
p19
aa(lp20
VIt wasn't, in fact, revolutionary politics
p21
aVfor which Galois was famous.
p22
aVBut a few years earlier, while still at school,
p23
aVhe'd actually cracked one of the big mathematical
p24
aVproblems at the time.
p25
aVAnd he wrote to the academicians in Paris,
p26
aVtrying to explain his theory.
p27
aVBut the academicians couldn't understand anything that he wrote.
p28
aV(Laughter)
p29
aVThis is how he wrote most of his mathematics.
p30
aa(lp31
VSo, the night before that duel, he realized
p32
aVthis possibly is his last chance
p33
aVto try and explain his great breakthrough.
p34
aVSo he stayed up the whole night, writing away,
p35
aVtrying to explain his ideas.
p36
aVAnd as the dawn came up and he went to meet his destiny,
p37
aVhe left this pile of papers on the table for the next generation.
p38
aVMaybe the fact that he stayed up all night doing mathematics
p39
aVwas the fact that he was such a bad shot that morning and got killed.
p40
aa(lp41
VBut contained inside those documents
p42
aVwas a new language, a language to understand
p43
aVone of the most fundamental concepts
p44
aVof science \u2014 namely symmetry.
p45
aVNow, symmetry is almost nature's language.
p46
aVIt helps us to understand so many
p47
aVdifferent bits of the scientific world.
p48
aVFor example, molecular structure.
p49
aVWhat crystals are possible,
p50
aVwe can understand through the mathematics of symmetry.
p51
aa(lp52
VIn microbiology you really don't want to get a symmetrical object,
p53
aVbecause they are generally rather nasty.
p54
aVThe swine flu virus, at the moment, is a symmetrical object.
p55
aVAnd it uses the efficiency of symmetry
p56
aVto be able to propagate itself so well.
p57
aVBut on a larger scale of biology, actually symmetry is very important,
p58
aVbecause it actually communicates genetic information.
p59
aa(lp60
VI've taken two pictures here and I've made them artificially symmetrical.
p61
aVAnd if I ask you which of these you find more beautiful,
p62
aVyou're probably drawn to the lower two.
p63
aVBecause it is hard to make symmetry.
p64
aVAnd if you can make yourself symmetrical, you're sending out a sign
p65
aVthat you've got good genes, you've got a good upbringing
p66
aVand therefore you'll make a good mate.
p67
aVSo symmetry is a language which can help to communicate
p68
aVgenetic information.
p69
aa(lp70
VSymmetry can also help us to explain
p71
aVwhat's happening in the Large Hadron Collider in CERN.
p72
aVOr what's not happening in the Large Hadron Collider in CERN.
p73
aVTo be able to make predictions about the fundamental particles
p74
aVwe might see there,
p75
aVit seems that they are all facets of some strange symmetrical shape
p76
aVin a higher dimensional space.
p77
aa(lp78
VAnd I think Galileo summed up, very nicely,
p79
aVthe power of mathematics
p80
aVto understand the scientific world around us.
p81
aVHe wrote, "The universe cannot be read
p82
aVuntil we have learnt the language
p83
aVand become familiar with the characters in which it is written.
p84
aVIt is written in mathematical language,
p85
aVand the letters are triangles, circles and other geometric figures,
p86
aVwithout which means it is humanly impossible
p87
aVto comprehend a single word."
p88
aa(lp89
VBut it's not just scientists who are interested in symmetry.
p90
aVArtists too love to play around with symmetry.
p91
aVThey also have a slightly more ambiguous relationship with it.
p92
aVHere is Thomas Mann talking about symmetry in "The Magic Mountain."
p93
aVHe has a character describing the snowflake,
p94
aVand he says he "shuddered at its perfect precision,
p95
aVfound it deathly, the very marrow of death."
p96
aa(lp97
VBut what artists like to do is to set up expectations
p98
aVof symmetry and then break them.
p99
aVAnd a beautiful example of this
p100
aVI found, actually, when I visited a colleague of mine
p101
aVin Japan, Professor Kurokawa.
p102
aVAnd he took me up to the temples in Nikko.
p103
aVAnd just after this photo was taken we walked up the stairs.
p104
aVAnd the gateway you see behind
p105
aVhas eight columns, with beautiful symmetrical designs on them.
p106
aVSeven of them are exactly the same,
p107
aVand the eighth one is turned upside down.
p108
aa(lp109
VAnd I said to Professor Kurokawa,
p110
aV"Wow, the architects must have really been kicking themselves
p111
aVwhen they realized that they'd made a mistake and put this one upside down."
p112
aVAnd he said, "No, no, no. It was a very deliberate act."
p113
aVAnd he referred me to this lovely quote from the Japanese
p114
aV"Essays in Idleness" from the 14th century,
p115
aVin which the essayist wrote, "In everything,
p116
aVuniformity is undesirable.
p117
aVLeaving something incomplete makes it interesting,
p118
aVand gives one the feeling that there is room for growth."
p119
aVEven when building the Imperial Palace,
p120
aVthey always leave one place unfinished.
p121
aa(lp122
VBut if I had to choose one building in the world
p123
aVto be cast out on a desert island, to live the rest of my life,
p124
aVbeing an addict of symmetry, I would probably choose the Alhambra in Granada.
p125
aVThis is a palace celebrating symmetry.
p126
aVRecently I took my family \u2014
p127
aVwe do these rather kind of nerdy mathematical trips, which my family love.
p128
aVThis is my son Tamer. You can see
p129
aVhe's really enjoying our mathematical trip to the Alhambra.
p130
aVBut I wanted to try and enrich him.
p131
aVI think one of the problems about school mathematics
p132
aVis it doesn't look at how mathematics is embedded
p133
aVin the world we live in.
p134
aVSo, I wanted to open his eyes up to
p135
aVhow much symmetry is running through the Alhambra.
p136
aa(lp137
VYou see it already. Immediately you go in,
p138
aVthe reflective symmetry in the water.
p139
aVBut it's on the walls where all the exciting things are happening.
p140
aVThe Moorish artists were denied the possibility
p141
aVto draw things with souls.
p142
aVSo they explored a more geometric art.
p143
aVAnd so what is symmetry?
p144
aVThe Alhambra somehow asks all of these questions.
p145
aVWhat is symmetry? When [there] are two of these walls,
p146
aVdo they have the same symmetries?
p147
aVCan we say whether they discovered
p148
aVall of the symmetries in the Alhambra?
p149
aa(lp150
VAnd it was Galois who produced a language
p151
aVto be able to answer some of these questions.
p152
aVFor Galois, symmetry \u2014 unlike for Thomas Mann,
p153
aVwhich was something still and deathly \u2014
p154
aVfor Galois, symmetry was all about motion.
p155
aVWhat can you do to a symmetrical object,
p156
aVmove it in some way, so it looks the same
p157
aVas before you moved it?
p158
aVI like to describe it as the magic trick moves.
p159
aVWhat can you do to something? You close your eyes.
p160
aVI do something, put it back down again.
p161
aVIt looks like it did before it started.
p162
aa(lp163
VSo, for example, the walls in the Alhambra \u2014
p164
aVI can take all of these tiles, and fix them at the yellow place,
p165
aVrotate them by 90 degrees,
p166
aVput them all back down again and they fit perfectly down there.
p167
aVAnd if you open your eyes again, you wouldn't know that they'd moved.
p168
aVBut it's the motion that really characterizes the symmetry
p169
aVinside the Alhambra.
p170
aVBut it's also about producing a language to describe this.
p171
aVAnd the power of mathematics is often
p172
aVto change one thing into another, to change geometry into language.
p173
aa(lp174
VSo I'm going to take you through, perhaps push you a little bit mathematically \u2014
p175
aVso brace yourselves \u2014
p176
aVpush you a little bit to understand how this language works,
p177
aVwhich enables us to capture what is symmetry.
p178
aVSo, let's take these two symmetrical objects here.
p179
aVLet's take the twisted six-pointed starfish.
p180
aVWhat can I do to the starfish which makes it look the same?
p181
aVWell, there I rotated it by a sixth of a turn,
p182
aVand still it looks like it did before I started.
p183
aVI could rotate it by a third of a turn,
p184
aVor a half a turn,
p185
aVor put it back down on its image, or two thirds of a turn.
p186
aVAnd a fifth symmetry, I can rotate it by five sixths of a turn.
p187
aVAnd those are things that I can do to the symmetrical object
p188
aVthat make it look like it did before I started.
p189
aa(lp190
VNow, for Galois, there was actually a sixth symmetry.
p191
aVCan anybody think what else I could do to this
p192
aVwhich would leave it like I did before I started?
p193
aVI can't flip it because I've put a little twist on it, haven't I?
p194
aVIt's got no reflective symmetry.
p195
aVBut what I could do is just leave it where it is,
p196
aVpick it up, and put it down again.
p197
aVAnd for Galois this was like the zeroth symmetry.
p198
aVActually, the invention of the number zero
p199
aVwas a very modern concept, seventh century A.D., by the Indians.
p200
aVIt seems mad to talk about nothing.
p201
aVAnd this is the same idea. This is a symmetrical \u2014
p202
aVso everything has symmetry, where you just leave it where it is.
p203
aa(lp204
VSo, this object has six symmetries.
p205
aVAnd what about the triangle?
p206
aVWell, I can rotate by a third of a turn clockwise
p207
aVor a third of a turn anticlockwise.
p208
aVBut now this has some reflectional symmetry.
p209
aVI can reflect it in the line through X,
p210
aVor the line through Y,
p211
aVor the line through Z.
p212
aVFive symmetries and then of course the zeroth symmetry
p213
aVwhere I just pick it up and leave it where it is.
p214
aVSo both of these objects have six symmetries.
p215
aVNow, I'm a great believer that mathematics is not a spectator sport,
p216
aVand you have to do some mathematics
p217
aVin order to really understand it.
p218
aa(lp219
VSo here is a little question for you.
p220
aVAnd I'm going to give a prize at the end of my talk
p221
aVfor the person who gets closest to the answer.
p222
aVThe Rubik's Cube.
p223
aVHow many symmetries does a Rubik's Cube have?
p224
aVHow many things can I do to this object
p225
aVand put it down so it still looks like a cube?
p226
aVOkay? So I want you to think about that problem as we go on,
p227
aVand count how many symmetries there are.
p228
aVAnd there will be a prize for the person who gets closest at the end.
p229
aa(lp230
VBut let's go back down to symmetries that I got for these two objects.
p231
aVWhat Galois realized: it isn't just the individual symmetries,
p232
aVbut how they interact with each other
p233
aVwhich really characterizes the symmetry of an object.
p234
aVIf I do one magic trick move followed by another,
p235
aVthe combination is a third magic trick move.
p236
aVAnd here we see Galois starting to develop
p237
aVa language to see the substance
p238
aVof the things unseen, the sort of abstract idea
p239
aVof the symmetry underlying this physical object.
p240
aVFor example, what if I turn the starfish
p241
aVby a sixth of a turn,
p242
aVand then a third of a turn?
p243
aa(lp244
VSo I've given names. The capital letters, A, B, C, D, E, F,
p245
aVare the names for the rotations.
p246
aVB, for example, rotates the little yellow dot
p247
aVto the B on the starfish. And so on.
p248
aVSo what if I do B, which is a sixth of a turn,
p249
aVfollowed by C, which is a third of a turn?
p250
aVWell let's do that. A sixth of a turn,
p251
aVfollowed by a third of a turn,
p252
aVthe combined effect is as if I had just rotated it by half a turn in one go.
p253
aVSo the little table here records
p254
aVhow the algebra of these symmetries work.
p255
aVI do one followed by another, the answer is
p256
aVit's rotation D, half a turn.
p257
aVWhat I if I did it in the other order? Would it make any difference?
p258
aVLet's see. Let's do the third of the turn first, and then the sixth of a turn.
p259
aVOf course, it doesn't make any difference.
p260
aVIt still ends up at half a turn.
p261
aa(lp262
VAnd there is some symmetry here in the way the symmetries interact with each other.
p263
aVBut this is completely different to the symmetries of the triangle.
p264
aVLet's see what happens if we do two symmetries
p265
aVwith the triangle, one after the other.
p266
aVLet's do a rotation by a third of a turn anticlockwise,
p267
aVand reflect in the line through X.
p268
aVWell, the combined effect is as if I had just done the reflection in the line through Z
p269
aVto start with.
p270
aVNow, let's do it in a different order.
p271
aVLet's do the reflection in X first,
p272
aVfollowed by the rotation by a third of a turn anticlockwise.
p273
aVThe combined effect, the triangle ends up somewhere completely different.
p274
aVIt's as if it was reflected in the line through Y.
p275
aa(lp276
VNow it matters what order you do the operations in.
p277
aVAnd this enables us to distinguish
p278
aVwhy the symmetries of these objects \u2014
p279
aVthey both have six symmetries. So why shouldn't we say
p280
aVthey have the same symmetries?
p281
aVBut the way the symmetries interact
p282
aVenable us \u2014 we've now got a language
p283
aVto distinguish why these symmetries are fundamentally different.
p284
aVAnd you can try this when you go down to the pub, later on.
p285
aVTake a beer mat and rotate it by a quarter of a turn,
p286
aVthen flip it. And then do it in the other order,
p287
aVand the picture will be facing in the opposite direction.
p288
aa(lp289
VNow, Galois produced some laws for how these tables \u2014 how symmetries interact.
p290
aVIt's almost like little Sudoku tables.
p291
aVYou don't see any symmetry twice
p292
aVin any row or column.
p293
aVAnd, using those rules, he was able to say
p294
aVthat there are in fact only two objects
p295
aVwith six symmetries.
p296
aVAnd they'll be the same as the symmetries of the triangle,
p297
aVor the symmetries of the six-pointed starfish.
p298
aVI think this is an amazing development.
p299
aVIt's almost like the concept of number being developed for symmetry.
p300
aVIn the front here, I've got one, two, three people
p301
aVsitting on one, two, three chairs.
p302
aVThe people and the chairs are very different,
p303
aVbut the number, the abstract idea of the number, is the same.
p304
aa(lp305
VAnd we can see this now: we go back to the walls in the Alhambra.
p306
aVHere are two very different walls,
p307
aVvery different geometric pictures.
p308
aVBut, using the language of Galois,
p309
aVwe can understand that the underlying abstract symmetries of these things
p310
aVare actually the same.
p311
aVFor example, let's take this beautiful wall
p312
aVwith the triangles with a little twist on them.
p313
aVYou can rotate them by a sixth of a turn
p314
aVif you ignore the colors. We're not matching up the colors.
p315
aVBut the shapes match up if I rotate by a sixth of a turn
p316
aVaround the point where all the triangles meet.
p317
aVWhat about the center of a triangle? I can rotate
p318
aVby a third of a turn around the center of the triangle,
p319
aVand everything matches up.
p320
aVAnd then there is an interesting place halfway along an edge,
p321
aVwhere I can rotate by 180 degrees.
p322
aVAnd all the tiles match up again.
p323
aVSo rotate along halfway along the edge, and they all match up.
p324
aa(lp325
VNow, let's move to the very different-looking wall in the Alhambra.
p326
aVAnd we find the same symmetries here, and the same interaction.
p327
aVSo, there was a sixth of a turn. A third of a turn where the Z pieces meet.
p328
aVAnd the half a turn is halfway between the six pointed stars.
p329
aVAnd although these walls look very different,
p330
aVGalois has produced a language to say
p331
aVthat in fact the symmetries underlying these are exactly the same.
p332
aVAnd it's a symmetry we call 6-3-2.
p333
aa(lp334
VHere is another example in the Alhambra.
p335
aVThis is a wall, a ceiling, and a floor.
p336
aVThey all look very different. But this language allows us to say
p337
aVthat they are representations of the same symmetrical abstract object,
p338
aVwhich we call 4-4-2. Nothing to do with football,
p339
aVbut because of the fact that there are two places where you can rotate
p340
aVby a quarter of a turn, and one by half a turn.
p341
aa(lp342
VNow, this power of the language is even more,
p343
aVbecause Galois can say,
p344
aV"Did the Moorish artists discover all of the possible symmetries
p345
aVon the walls in the Alhambra?"
p346
aVAnd it turns out they almost did.
p347
aVYou can prove, using Galois' language,
p348
aVthere are actually only 17
p349
aVdifferent symmetries that you can do in the walls in the Alhambra.
p350
aVAnd they, if you try to produce a different wall with this 18th one,
p351
aVit will have to have the same symmetries as one of these 17.
p352
aa(lp353
VBut these are things that we can see.
p354
aVAnd the power of Galois' mathematical language
p355
aVis it also allows us to create
p356
aVsymmetrical objects in the unseen world,
p357
aVbeyond the two-dimensional, three-dimensional,
p358
aVall the way through to the four- or five- or infinite-dimensional space.
p359
aVAnd that's where I work. I create
p360
aVmathematical objects, symmetrical objects,
p361
aVusing Galois' language,
p362
aVin very high dimensional spaces.
p363
aVSo I think it's a great example of things unseen,
p364
aVwhich the power of mathematical language allows you to create.
p365
aa(lp366
VSo, like Galois, I stayed up all last night
p367
aVcreating a new mathematical symmetrical object for you,
p368
aVand I've got a picture of it here.
p369
aVWell, unfortunately it isn't really a picture. If I could have my board
p370
aVat the side here, great, excellent.
p371
aVHere we are. Unfortunately, I can't show you
p372
aVa picture of this symmetrical object.
p373
aVBut here is the language which describes
p374
aVhow the symmetries interact.
p375
aa(lp376
VNow, this new symmetrical object
p377
aVdoes not have a name yet.
p378
aVNow, people like getting their names on things,
p379
aVon craters on the moon
p380
aVor new species of animals.
p381
aVSo I'm going to give you the chance to get your name on a new symmetrical object
p382
aVwhich hasn't been named before.
p383
aVAnd this thing \u2014 species die away,
p384
aVand moons kind of get hit by meteors and explode \u2014
p385
aVbut this mathematical object will live forever.
p386
aVIt will make you immortal.
p387
aVIn order to win this symmetrical object,
p388
aVwhat you have to do is to answer the question I asked you at the beginning.
p389
aVHow many symmetries does a Rubik's Cube have?
p390
aa(lp391
VOkay, I'm going to sort you out.
p392
aVRather than you all shouting out, I want you to count how many digits there are
p393
aVin that number. Okay?
p394
aVIf you've got it as a factorial, you've got to expand the factorials.
p395
aVOkay, now if you want to play,
p396
aVI want you to stand up, okay?
p397
aVIf you think you've got an estimate for how many digits,
p398
aVright \u2014 we've already got one competitor here.
p399
aVIf you all stay down he wins it automatically.
p400
aVOkay. Excellent. So we've got four here, five, six.
p401
aVGreat. Excellent. That should get us going. All right.
p402
aa(lp403
VAnybody with five or less digits, you've got to sit down,
p404
aVbecause you've underestimated.
p405
aVFive or less digits. So, if you're in the tens of thousands you've got to sit down.
p406
aV60 digits or more, you've got to sit down.
p407
aVYou've overestimated.
p408
aV20 digits or less, sit down.
p409
aVHow many digits are there in your number?
p410
aVTwo? So you should have sat down earlier.
p411
aV(Laughter)
p412
aVLet's have the other ones, who sat down during the 20, up again. Okay?
p413
aVIf I told you 20 or less, stand up.
p414
aVBecause this one. I think there were a few here.
p415
aVThe people who just last sat down.
p416
aa(lp417
VOkay, how many digits do you have in your number?
p418
aV(Laughs)
p419
aV21. Okay good. How many do you have in yours?
p420
aV18. So it goes to this lady here.
p421
aV21 is the closest.
p422
aVIt actually has \u2014 the number of symmetries in the Rubik's cube
p423
aVhas 25 digits.
p424
aVSo now I need to name this object.
p425
aVSo, what is your name?
p426
aVI need your surname. Symmetrical objects generally \u2014
p427
