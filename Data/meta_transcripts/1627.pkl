VIn 2002, a group of treatment activists met
p4
aVto discuss the early development of the airplane.
p5
aVThe Wright Brothers, in the beginning of the last century,
p6
aVhad for the first time managed
p7
aVto make one of those devices fly.
p8
aVThey also had taken out numerous patents
p9
aVon essential parts of the airplane.
p10
aVThey were not the only ones.
p11
aVThat was common practice in the industry,
p12
aVand those who held patents on airplanes
p13
aVwere defending them fiercely
p14
aVand suing competitors left and right.
p15
aa(lp16
VThis actually wasn't so great for the development of the aviation industry,
p17
aVand this was at a time that in particular the U.S. government
p18
aVwas interested in ramping up
p19
aVthe production of military airplanes.
p20
aVSo there was a bit of a conflict there.
p21
aVThe U.S. government decided to take action,
p22
aVand forced those patent holders
p23
aVto make their patents available to share with others
p24
aVto enable the production of airplanes.
p25
aa(lp26
VSo what has this
p27
aVgot to do with this?
p28
aa(lp29
VIn 2002, Nelson Otwoma, a Kenyan social scientist,
p30
aVdiscovered he had HIV and needed access to treatment.
p31
aVHe was told that a cure did not exist.
p32
aVAIDS, he heard, was lethal,
p33
aVand treatment was not offered. This was at a time
p34
aVthat treatment actually existed in rich countries.
p35
aVAIDS had become a chronic disease.
p36
aVPeople in our countries here in Europe, in North America,
p37
aVwere living with HIV, healthy lives.
p38
aVNot so for Nelson. He wasn't rich enough,
p39
aVand not so for his three-year-old son, who he discovered a year later
p40
aValso had HIV.
p41
aa(lp42
VNelson decided to become a treatment activist
p43
aVand join up with other groups.
p44
aVIn 2002, they were facing a different battle.
p45
aVPrices for ARVs, the drugs needed to treat HIV,
p46
aVcost about 12,000 [dollars] per patient per year.
p47
aVThe patents on those drugs were held
p48
aVby a number of Western pharmaceutical companies
p49
aVthat were not necessarily willing
p50
aVto make those patents available.
p51
aVWhen you have a patent, you can exclude
p52
aVanyone else from making, from producing or making
p53
aVlow-cost versions, for example,
p54
aVavailable of those medications.
p55
aVClearly this led to patent wars breaking out
p56
aVall over the globe.
p57
aa(lp58
VLuckily, those patents did not exist everywhere.
p59
aVThere were countries that did not recognize
p60
aVpharmaceutical product patents, such as India,
p61
aVand Indian pharmaceutical companies
p62
aVstarted to produce so-called generic versions,
p63
aVlow-cost copies of antiretroviral medicines,
p64
aVand make them available in the developing world,
p65
aVand within a year the price had come down
p66
aVfrom 10,000 dollars per patient per year
p67
aVto 350 dollars per patient per year,
p68
aVand today that same triple pill cocktail
p69
aVis available for 60 dollars per patient per year,
p70
aVand of course that started to have an enormous effect
p71
aVon the number of people who could afford access
p72
aVto those medicines.
p73
aVTreatment programs became possible,
p74
aVfunding became available, and the number of people
p75
aVon antiretroviral drugs started to increase very rapidly.
p76
aa(lp77
VToday, eight million people
p78
aVhave access to antiretroviral drugs.
p79
aVThirty-four million are infected with HIV.
p80
aVNever has this number been so high,
p81
aVbut actually this is good news,
p82
aVbecause what it means is people stop dying.
p83
aVPeople who have access to these drugs stop dying.
p84
aVAnd there's something else.
p85
aVThey also stop passing on the virus.
p86
aVThis is fairly recent science that has shown that.
p87
aVWhat that means is we have the tools
p88
aVto break the back of this epidemic.
p89
aa(lp90
VSo what's the problem?
p91
aVWell, things have changed.
p92
aVFirst of all, the rules have changed.
p93
aVToday, all countries are obliged to provide
p94
aVpatents for pharmaceuticals that last at least 20 years.
p95
aVThis is as a result of the intellectual property rules
p96
aVof the World Trade Organization.
p97
aVSo what India did is no longer possible.
p98
aVSecond, the practice of patent-holding companies have changed.
p99
aVHere you see the patent practices
p100
aVbefore the World Trade Organization's rules, before '95,
p101
aVbefore antiretroviral drugs.
p102
aVThis is what you see today,
p103
aVand this is in developing countries, so what that means is,
p104
aVunless we do something deliberate
p105
aVand unless we do something now,
p106
aVwe will very soon be faced with another drug price crisis,
p107
aVbecause new drugs are developed,
p108
aVnew drugs go to market, but these medicines are patented
p109
aVin a much wider range of countries.
p110
aVSo unless we act, unless we do something today,
p111
aVwe will soon be faced [with] what some have termed
p112
aVthe treatment time bomb.
p113
aa(lp114
VIt isn't only the number of drugs that are patented.
p115
aVThere's something else that can really scare
p116
aVgeneric manufacturers away.
p117
aVThis shows you a patent landscape.
p118
aVThis is the landscape of one medicine.
p119
aVSo you can imagine that if you are a generic company
p120
aVabout to decide whether to invest
p121
aVin the development of this product, unless you know
p122
aVthat the licenses to these patents
p123
aVare actually going to be available,
p124
aVyou will probably choose to do something else.
p125
aVAgain, deliberate action is needed.
p126
aa(lp127
VSo surely
p128
aVif a patent pool could be established
p129
aVto ramp up the production of military airplanes,
p130
aVwe should be able to do something similar
p131
aVto tackle the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
p132
aa(lp133
VAnd we did.
p134
aVIn 2010, UNITAID established the Medicines Patent Pool
p135
aVfor HIV.
p136
aVAnd this is how it works:
p137
aVPatent holders, inventors
p138
aVthat develop new medicines
p139
aVpatent those inventions,
p140
aVbut make those patents available
p141
aVto the Medicines Patent Pool. The Medicines Patent Pool
p142
aVthen license those out to whoever needs access to those patents.
p143
aVThat can be generic manufacturers.
p144
aVIt can also be not-for-profit drug development agencies,
p145
aVfor example.
p146
aVThose manufacturers can then sell those medicines
p147
aVat much lower cost to people who need access to them,
p148
aVto treatment programs that need access to them.
p149
aVThey pay royalties over the sales to the patent holders,
p150
aVso they are remunerated for sharing their intellectual property.
p151
aa(lp152
VThere is one key difference
p153
aVwith the airplane patent pool.
p154
aVThe Medicines Patent Pool is a voluntary mechanism.
p155
aVThe airplane patent holders were not left a choice
p156
aVwhether they'd license their patents or not.
p157
aVThey were forced to do so.
p158
aVThat is something that the Medicines Patent Pool cannot do.
p159
aVIt relies on the willingness of pharmaceutical companies
p160
aVto license their patents and make them available
p161
aVfor others to use.
p162
aa(lp163
VToday, Nelson Otwoma is healthy.
p164
aVHe has access to antiretroviral drugs.
p165
aVHis son will soon be 14 years old.
p166
aVNelson is a member of the expert advisory group
p167
aVof the Medicines Patent Pool,
p168
aVand he told me not so long ago,
p169
aV"Ellen, we rely in Kenya and in many other countries
p170
aVon the Medicines Patent Pool to make sure
p171
aVthat new medicines also become available to us,
p172
aVthat new medicines, without delay, become available to us."
p173
aa(lp174
VAnd this is no longer fantasy.
p175
aVAlready, I'll give you an example.
p176
aVIn August of this year, the United States drug agency
p177
aVapproved a new four-in-one AIDS medication.
p178
aVThe company, Gilead, that holds the patents,
p179
aVhas licensed the intellectual property to the Medicines Patent Pool.
p180
aVThe pool is already working today, two months later,
p181
aVwith generic manufacturers to make sure that this product
p182
aVcan go to market at low cost
p183
aVwhere and when it is needed. This is unprecedented.
p184
aVThis has never been done before.
p185
aVThe rule is about a 10-year delay for a new product
p186
aVto go to market in developing countries, if at all.
p187
aVThis has never been seen before.
p188
aVNelson's expectations are very high,
p189
aVand quite rightly so. He and his son will need access
p190
aVto the next generation of antiretrovirals
p191
aVand the next, throughout their lifetime,
p192
aVso that he and many others in Kenya and other countries
p193
aVcan continue to live healthy, active lives.
p194
aa(lp195
VNow we count on the willingness of drug companies
p196
aVto make that happen. We count on those companies
p197
aVthat understand that it is in the interest, not only in the interest
p198
aVof the global good, but also in their own interest,
p199
aVto move from conflict to collaboration,
p200
aVand through the Medicines Patent Pool they can make that happen.
p201
aVThey can also choose not to do that,
p202
aVbut those that go down that road may end up
p203
aVin a similar situation the Wright brothers ended up with
p204
aVearly last century, facing forcible measures
p205
aVby government. So they'd better jump now.
p206
aVThank you. (Applause)
