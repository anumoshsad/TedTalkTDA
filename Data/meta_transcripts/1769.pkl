VThe idea of eliminating poverty is a great goal.
p4
aVI don't think anyone in this room would disagree.
p5
aVWhat worries me is when politicians with money
p6
aVand charismatic rock stars \u2014
p7
aa(lp8
V(Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
Vuse the words,
p11
aV" ... it all just sounds so, so simple."
p12
aa(lp13
VNow, I've got no bucket of money today
p14
aVand I've got no policy to release,
p15
aVand I certainly haven't got a guitar.
p16
aVI'll leave that to others.
p17
aVBut I do have an idea,
p18
aVand that idea is called Housing for Health.
p19
aa(lp20
VHousing for Health works with poor people.
p21
aVIt works in the places where they live,
p22
aVand the work is done to improve their health.
p23
aVOver the last 28 years,
p24
aVthis tough, grinding, dirty work
p25
aVhas been done by literally thousands of people around Australia
p26
aVand, more recently, overseas,
p27
aVand their work has proven
p28
aVthat focused design can improve even the poorest living environments.
p29
aVIt can improve health
p30
aVand it can play a part in reducing, if not eliminating, poverty.
p31
aa(lp32
VI'm going to start where the story began \u2014
p33
aV1985, in Central Australia.
p34
aVA man called Yami Lester, an Aboriginal man,
p35
aVwas running a health service.
p36
aVEighty percent of what walked in the door, in terms of illness,
p37
aVwas infectious disease \u2014
p38
aVthird world, developing world infectious disease,
p39
aVcaused by a poor living environment.
p40
aa(lp41
VYami assembled a team in Alice Springs.
p42
aVHe got a medical doctor.
p43
aVHe got an environmental health guy.
p44
aVAnd he hand-selected a team of local Aboriginal people
p45
aVto work on this project.
p46
aVYami told us at that first meeting,
p47
aV"There's no money," \u2014 always a good start \u2014
p48
aV" ... no money, you have six months,
p49
aVand I want you to start on a project \u2014" which, in his language,
p50
aVhe called "Uwankara Palyanku Kanyintjaku,"
p51
aVwhich, translated, is "a plan to stop people getting sick" \u2014
p52
aVa profound brief.
p53
aVThat was our task.
p54
aa(lp55
VFirst step, the medical doctor went away for about six months.
p56
aVAnd he worked on what were to become these nine health goals \u2014
p57
aVwhat were we aiming at?
p58
aVAfter six months of work, he came to my office
p59
aVand presented me with those nine words on a piece of paper.
p60
aa(lp61
V[The 9 Healthy Living Practices: Washing, clothes, wastewater, nutrition, crowding,
p62
aVanimals, dust, temperature, injury]
p63
aa(lp64
VI was very unimpressed. Big ideas need big words,
p65
aVand preferably a lot of them.
p66
aVThis didn't fit the bill.
p67
aVWhat I didn't see and what you can't see
p68
aVwas that he'd assembled thousands of pages
p69
aVof local, national and international health research
p70
aVthat filled out the picture as to why these were the health targets.
p71
aa(lp72
VThe pictures that came a bit later had a very simple reason.
p73
aVThe Aboriginal people who were our bosses and the senior people
p74
aVwere most commonly illiterate,
p75
aVso the story had to be told in pictures
p76
aVof what these goals were.
p77
aVWe worked with the community,
p78
aVnot telling them what was going to happen
p79
aVin a language they didn't understand.
p80
aa(lp81
VSo we had the goals and each one of these goals \u2014
p82
aVand I won't go through them all \u2014
p83
aVputs at the center the person and their health issue,
p84
aVand it then connects them
p85
aVto the bits of the physical environment that are actually needed
p86
aVto keep their health good.
p87
aVAnd the highest priority, you see on the screen,
p88
aVis washing people once a day, particularly children.
p89
aa(lp90
VAnd I hope most of you are thinking,
p91
aV"What? That sounds simple."
p92
aa(lp93
VNow, I'm going to ask you all a very personal question.
p94
aVThis morning before you came,
p95
aVwho could have had a wash using a shower?
p96
aVI'm not going to ask if you had a shower, because I'm too polite.
p97
aVThat's it.
p98
aa(lp99
V(Laughter)
p100
aa(lp101
VAll right, I think it's fair to say
p102
aVmost people here could have had a shower this morning.
p103
aa(lp104
VI'm going to ask you to do some more work.
p105
aVI want you all to select one of the houses
p106
aVof the 25 houses you see on the screen.
p107
aVI want you to select one of them and note the position of that house
p108
aVand keep that in your head.
p109
aVHave you all got a house?
p110
aVI'm going to ask you to live there for a few months,
p111
aVso make sure you've got it right.
p112
aVIt's in the northwest of Western Australia, very pleasant place.
p113
aa(lp114
VOK. Let's see if your shower in that house is working.
p115
aVI hear some "Aw!" and I hear some "Ah!"
p116
aa(lp117
VIf you get a green tick, your shower's working.
p118
aVYou and your kids are fine.
p119
aVIf you get a red cross,
p120
aVwell, I've looked carefully around the room
p121
aVand it's not going to make much difference to this crew.
p122
aVWhy? Because you're all too old.
p123
aVI know that's going to come as a shock to some of you, but you are.
p124
aVAnd before you get offended and leave,
p125
aVI've got to say that being too old,
p126
aVin this case, means that pretty much everyone in the room, I think,
p127
aVis over five years of age.
p128
aa(lp129
VWe're really concerned with kids naught to five.
p130
aVAnd why?
p131
aVWashing is the antidote to the sort of bugs,
p132
aVthe common infectious diseases of the eyes, the ears,
p133
aVthe chest and the skin
p134
aVthat, if they occur in the first five years of life,
p135
aVpermanently damage those organs.
p136
aVThey leave a lifelong remnant.
p137
aVThat means that by the age of five,
p138
aVyou can't see as well for the rest of your life.
p139
aVYou can't hear as well for the rest of your life.
p140
aVYou can't breathe as well.
p141
aVYou've lost a third of your lung capacity by the age of five.
p142
aVAnd even skin infection,
p143
aVwhich we originally thought wasn't that big a problem,
p144
aVmild skin infections naught to five give you
p145
aVa greatly increased chance of renal failure,
p146
aVneeding dialysis at age 40.
p147
aVThis is a big deal, so the ticks and crosses on the screen
p148
aVare actually critical for young kids.
p149
aa(lp150
VThose ticks and crosses represent the 7,800 houses
p151
aVwe've looked at nationally around Australia,
p152
aVthe same proportion.
p153
aVWhat you see on the screen \u2014
p154
aV35 percent of those not-so-famous houses
p155
aVlived in by 50,000 indigenous people \u2014
p156
aV35 percent had a working shower.
p157
aVTen percent of those same 7,800 houses had safe electrical systems.
p158
aVAnd 58 percent of those houses had a working toilet.
p159
aVThese are by a simple, standard test.
p160
aVIn the case of the shower:
p161
aVdoes it have hot and cold water, two taps that work,
p162
aVa shower rose to get water onto your head or onto your body,
p163
aVand a drain that takes the water away?
p164
aVNot well-designed, not beautiful, not elegant \u2014
p165
aVjust that they function.
p166
aVAnd the same tests for the electrical system
p167
aVand the toilets.
p168
aa(lp169
VHousing for Health projects aren't about measuring failure \u2014
p170
aVthey're actually about improving houses.
p171
aVWe start on day one of every project.
p172
aVWe've learned \u2014 we don't make promises, we don't do reports.
p173
aVWe arrive in the morning with tools, tons of equipment, trades,
p174
aVand we train up a local team on the first day to start work.
p175
aVBy the evening of the first day,
p176
aVa few houses in that community are better than when we started in the morning.
p177
aa(lp178
VThat work continues for six to 12 months,
p179
aVuntil all the houses are improved
p180
aVand we've spent our budget of 7,500 dollars total per house.
p181
aVThat's our average budget.
p182
aVAt the end of six months to a year, we test every house again.
p183
aVIt's very easy to spend money.
p184
aVIt's very difficult to improve
p185
aVthe function of all those parts of the house.
p186
aVAnd for a whole house, the nine healthy living practices,
p187
aVwe test, check and fix 250 items in every house.
p188
aa(lp189
VAnd these are the results we can get with our 7,500 dollars.
p190
aVWe can get showers up to 86 percent working,
p191
aVwe can get electrical systems up to 77 percent working
p192
aVand we can get 90 percent of toilets working
p193
aVin those 7,500 houses.
p194
aV(Applause)
p195
aa(lp196
VThank you.
p197
aa(lp198
V(Applause)
p199
aa(lp200
VThe teams do a great job, and that's their work.
p201
aa(lp202
VI think there's an obvious question
p203
aVthat I hope you're thinking about.
p204
aVWhy do we have to do this work?
p205
aVWhy are the houses in such poor condition?
p206
aVSeventy percent of the work we do is due to lack of routine maintenance \u2014
p207
aVthe sort of things that happen in all our houses.
p208
aVThings wear out, should have been done by state government or local government,
p209
aVsimply not done, the house doesn't work.
p210
aVTwenty-one percent of the things we fix are due to faulty construction \u2014
p211
aVliterally things that are built upside down and back to front.
p212
aVThey don't work, we have to fix them.
p213
aa(lp214
VAnd if you've lived in Australia in the last 30 years, the final cause \u2014
p215
aVyou will have heard always that indigenous people trash houses.
p216
aVIt's one of the almost rock-solid pieces of evidence
p217
aVwhich I've never seen evidence for,
p218
aVthat's always reeled out as "That's the problem with indigenous housing."
p219
aVWell, nine percent of what we spend is damage,
p220
aVmisuse or abuse of any sort.
p221
aVWe argue strongly that the people living in the house
p222
aVare simply not the problem.
p223
aVAnd we'll go a lot further than that;
p224
aVthe people living in the house are actually a major part of the solution.
p225
aVSeventy-five percent of our national team in Australia \u2014
p226
aVover 75 at the minute \u2014
p227
aVare actually local, indigenous people from the communities we work in.
p228
aVThey do all aspects of the work.
p229
aa(lp230
V(Applause)
p231
aa(lp232
VIn 2010, for example, there were 831,
p233
aVall over Australia, and the Torres Strait Islands,
p234
aVall states, working to improve the houses where they and their families live,
p235
aVand that's an important thing.
p236
aa(lp237
VOur work's always had a focus on health.
p238
aVThat's the key.
p239
aVThe developing world bug, trachoma, causes blindness.
p240
aVIt's a developing-world illness,
p241
aVand yet, the picture you see behind
p242
aVis in an Aboriginal community in the late 1990s,
p243
aVwhere 95 percent of school-aged kids had active trachoma
p244
aVin their eyes, doing damage.
p245
aa(lp246
VOK, what do we do?
p247
aVWell, first thing we do, we get showers working.
p248
aVWhy? Because that flushes the bug out.
p249
aVWe put washing facilities in the school as well,
p250
aVso kids can wash their faces many times during the day.
p251
aVWe wash the bug out.
p252
aa(lp253
VSecond, the eye doctors tell us that dust scours the eye
p254
aVand lets the bug in quick.
p255
aVSo what do we do?
p256
aVWe call up the doctor of dust, and there is such a person.
p257
aVHe was loaned to us by a mining company.
p258
aVHe controls dust on mining company sites.
p259
aVAnd he came out and, within a day,
p260
aVit worked out that most dust in this community
p261
aVwas within a meter of the ground, the wind-driven dust \u2014
p262
aVso he suggested making mounds to catch the dust
p263
aVbefore it went into the house area and affected the eyes of kids.
p264
aVSo we used dirt to stop dust.
p265
aVWe did it. He provided us dust monitors.
p266
aVWe tested and we reduced the dust.
p267
aa(lp268
VThen we wanted to get rid of the bug generally.
p269
aVSo how do we do that?
p270
aVWell, we call up the doctor of flies \u2014 and, yes, there is a doctor of flies.
p271
aVAs our Aboriginal mate said,
p272
aV"You white fellows ought to get out more."
p273
aa(lp274
V(Laughter)
p275
aa(lp276
VAnd the doctor of flies very quickly determined
p277
aVthat there was one fly that carried the bug.
p278
aVHe could give school kids in this community
p279
aVthe beautiful fly trap you see above in the slide.
p280
aVThey could trap the flies, send them to him in Perth.
p281
aVWhen the bug was in the gut,
p282
aVhe'd send back by return post some dung beetles.
p283
aVThe dung beetles ate the camel dung,
p284
aVthe flies died through lack of food,
p285
aVand trachoma dropped.
p286
aVAnd over the year, trachoma dropped radically in this place, and stayed low.
p287
aVWe changed the environment, not just treated the eyes.
p288
aVAnd finally, you get a good eye.
p289
aa(lp290
VAll these small health gains
p291
aVand small pieces of the puzzle make a big difference.
p292
aVThe New South Wales Department of Health,
p293
aVthat radical organization,
p294
aVdid an independent trial over three years
p295
aVto look at 10 years of the work we've been doing
p296
aVin these sorts of projects in New South Wales.
p297
aVAnd they found a 40 percent reduction in hospital admissions
p298
aVfor the illnesses that you could attribute to the poor environment \u2014
p299
aVa 40 percent reduction.
p300
aa(lp301
V(Applause)
p302
aa(lp303
VJust to show that the principles we've used in Australia
p304
aVcan be used in other places,
p305
aVI'm just going to go to one other place, and that's Nepal.
p306
aVAnd what a beautiful place to go.
p307
aVWe were asked by a small village of 600 people
p308
aVto go in and make toilets where none existed.
p309
aVHealth was poor.
p310
aVWe went in with no grand plan,
p311
aVno grand promises of a great program,
p312
aVjust the offer to build two toilets for two families.
p313
aVIt was during the design of the first toilet
p314
aVthat I went for lunch,
p315
aVinvited by the family into their main room of the house.
p316
aVIt was choking with smoke.
p317
aVPeople were cooking on their only fuel source, green timber.
p318
aVThe smoke coming off that timber is choking,
p319
aVand in an enclosed house, you simply can't breathe.
p320
aVLater we found the leading cause of illness and death
p321
aVin this particular region is through respiratory failure.
p322
aa(lp323
VSo all of a sudden, we had two problems.
p324
aVWe were there originally to look at toilets
p325
aVand get human waste off the ground, that's fine.
p326
aVBut all of a sudden now there was a second problem:
p327
aVHow do we actually get the smoke down?
p328
aVSo two problems, and design should be about more than one thing.
p329
aVSolution: Take human waste, take animal waste,
p330
aVput it into a chamber, out of that, extract biogas,
p331
aVmethane gas.
p332
aVThe gas gives three to four hours cooking a day \u2014
p333
aVclean, smokeless and free for the family.
p334
aa(lp335
V(Applause)
p336
aa(lp337
VI put it to you: is this eliminating poverty?
p338
aVAnd the answer from the Nepali team who's working at the minute would say,
p339
aVdon't be ridiculous \u2014
p340
aVwe have three million more toilets to build
p341
aVbefore we can even make a stab at that claim.
p342
aVAnd I don't pretend anything else.
p343
aa(lp344
VBut as we all sit here today,
p345
aVthere are now over 100 toilets built
p346
aVin this village and a couple nearby.
p347
aVWell over 1,000 people use those toilets.
p348
aVYami Lama, he's a young boy.
p349
aVHe's got significantly less gut infection because he's now got toilets,
p350
aVand there isn't human waste on the ground.
p351
aVKanji Maya, she's a mother, and a proud one.
p352
aVShe's probably right now cooking lunch for her family
p353
aVon biogas, smokeless fuel.
p354
aVHer lungs have got better,
p355
aVand they'll get better as time increases,
p356
aVbecause she's not cooking in the same smoke.
p357
aVSurya takes the waste out of the biogas chamber
p358
aVwhen it's shed the gas, he puts it on his crops.
p359
aVHe's trebled his crop income,
p360
aVmore food for the family and more money for the family.
p361
aVAnd finally Bishnu, the leader of the team,
p362
aVhas now understood that not only have we built toilets,
p363
aVwe've also built a team,
p364
aVand that team is now working in two villages
p365
aVwhere they're training up the next two villages
p366
aVto keep the work expanding.
p367
aVAnd that, to me, is the key.
p368
aa(lp369
V(Applause)
p370
aa(lp371
VPeople are not the problem.
p372
aVWe've never found that.
p373
aVThe problem: poor living environment,
p374
aVpoor housing and the bugs that do people harm.
p375
aVNone of those are limited by geography, by skin color or by religion.
p376
aVNone of them.
p377
aVThe common link between all the work we've had to do
p378
aVis one thing, and that's poverty.
p379
aa(lp380
VNelson Mandela said, in the mid-2000s, not too far from here,
p381
aVhe said that like slavery and apartheid, "Poverty is not natural.
p382
aVIt is man-made and can be overcome and eradicated
p383
aVby the actions of human beings."
p384
aVI want to end by saying
p385
aVit's been the actions of thousands of ordinary human beings
p386
aVdoing \u2014 I think \u2014 extraordinary work,
p387
aVthat have actually improved health,
p388
aVand, maybe only in a small way, reduced poverty.
p389
