VI'm a storyteller.
p4
aVThat's what I do in life \u2014 telling stories,
p5
aVwriting novels \u2014
p6
aVand today I would like to tell you a few stories
p7
aVabout the art of storytelling
p8
aVand also some supernatural creatures
p9
aVcalled the djinni.
p10
aVBut before I go there, please allow me to share with you
p11
aVglimpses of my personal story.
p12
aVI will do so with the help of words, of course,
p13
aVbut also a geometrical shape, the circle,
p14
aVso throughout my talk,
p15
aVyou will come across several circles.
p16
aa(lp17
VI was born in Strasbourg, France
p18
aVto Turkish parents.
p19
aVShortly after, my parents got separated,
p20
aVand I came to Turkey with my mom.
p21
aVFrom then on, I was raised
p22
aVas a single child by a single mother.
p23
aVNow in the early 1970s, in Ankara,
p24
aVthat was a bit unusual.
p25
aVOur neighborhood was full of large families,
p26
aVwhere fathers were the heads of households,
p27
aVso I grew up seeing my mother as a divorcee
p28
aVin a patriarchal environment.
p29
aVIn fact, I grew up observing
p30
aVtwo different kinds of womanhood.
p31
aVOn the one hand was my mother,
p32
aVa well-educated, secular, modern, westernized, Turkish woman.
p33
aVOn the other hand was my grandmother,
p34
aVwho also took care of me
p35
aVand was more spiritual, less educated
p36
aVand definitely less rational.
p37
aVThis was a woman who read coffee grounds to see the future
p38
aVand melted lead into mysterious shapes
p39
aVto fend off the evil eye.
p40
aa(lp41
VMany people visited my grandmother,
p42
aVpeople with severe acne on their faces
p43
aVor warts on their hands.
p44
aVEach time, my grandmother would utter some words in Arabic,
p45
aVtake a red apple and stab it
p46
aVwith as many rose thorns
p47
aVas the number of warts she wanted to remove.
p48
aVThen one by one, she would
p49
aVencircle these thorns with dark ink.
p50
aVA week later, the patient would come back
p51
aVfor a follow-up examination.
p52
aVNow, I'm aware that I should not be saying such things
p53
aVin front of an audience of scholars and scientists,
p54
aVbut the truth is, of all the people
p55
aVwho visited my grandmother for their skin conditions,
p56
aVI did not see anyone go back
p57
aVunhappy or unhealed.
p58
aVI asked her how she did this. Was it the power of praying?
p59
aVIn response she said, "Yes, praying is effective,
p60
aVbut also beware of the power of circles."
p61
aa(lp62
VFrom her, I learned, amongst many other things,
p63
aVone very precious lesson \u2014
p64
aVthat if you want to destroy something in this life,
p65
aVbe it an acne, a blemish
p66
aVor the human soul,
p67
aVall you need to do is to surround it with thick walls.
p68
aVIt will dry up inside.
p69
aVNow we all live in some kind of a social and cultural circle.
p70
aVWe all do.
p71
aVWe're born into a certain family, nation, class.
p72
aVBut if we have no connection whatsoever
p73
aVwith the worlds beyond the one we take for granted,
p74
aVthen we too run the risk
p75
aVof drying up inside.
p76
aVOur imagination might shrink;
p77
aVour hearts might dwindle,
p78
aVand our humanness might wither
p79
aVif we stay for too long
p80
aVinside our cultural cocoons.
p81
aVOur friends, neighbors, colleagues, family \u2014
p82
aVif all the people in our inner circle resemble us,
p83
aVit means we are surrounded
p84
aVwith our mirror image.
p85
aa(lp86
VNow one other thing women like my grandma do in Turkey
p87
aVis to cover mirrors with velvet
p88
aVor to hang them on the walls with their backs facing out.
p89
aVIt's an old Eastern tradition
p90
aVbased on the knowledge that it's not healthy
p91
aVfor a human being to spend too much time
p92
aVstaring at his own reflection.
p93
aVIronically, [living in] communities of the like-minded
p94
aVis one of the greatest dangers
p95
aVof today's globalized world.
p96
aVAnd it's happening everywhere,
p97
aVamong liberals and conservatives,
p98
aVagnostics and believers, the rich and the poor,
p99
aVEast and West alike.
p100
aVWe tend to form clusters
p101
aVbased on similarity,
p102
aVand then we produce stereotypes
p103
aVabout other clusters of people.
p104
aVIn my opinion, one way of transcending
p105
aVthese cultural ghettos
p106
aVis through the art of storytelling.
p107
aVStories cannot demolish frontiers,
p108
aVbut they can punch holes in our mental walls.
p109
aVAnd through those holes, we can get a glimpse of the other,
p110
aVand sometimes even like what we see.
p111
aa(lp112
VI started writing fiction at the age of eight.
p113
aVMy mother came home one day with a turquoise notebook
p114
aVand asked me if I'd be interested in keeping a personal journal.
p115
aVIn retrospect, I think she was slightly worried
p116
aVabout my sanity.
p117
aVI was constantly telling stories at home, which was good,
p118
aVexcept I told this to imaginary friends around me,
p119
aVwhich was not so good.
p120
aVI was an introverted child,
p121
aVto the point of communicating with colored crayons
p122
aVand apologizing to objects
p123
aVwhen I bumped into them,
p124
aVso my mother thought it might do me good
p125
aVto write down my day-to-day experiences
p126
aVand emotions.
p127
aVWhat she didn't know was that I thought my life was terribly boring,
p128
aVand the last thing I wanted to do
p129
aVwas to write about myself.
p130
aVInstead, I began to write about people other than me
p131
aVand things that never really happened.
p132
aVAnd thus began my life-long passion
p133
aVfor writing fiction.
p134
aVSo from the very beginning, fiction for me
p135
aVwas less of an autobiographical manifestation
p136
aVthan a transcendental journey
p137
aVinto other lives, other possibilities.
p138
aVAnd please bear with me:
p139
aVI'll draw a circle and come back to this point.
p140
aa(lp141
VNow one other thing happened around this same time.
p142
aVMy mother became a diplomat.
p143
aVSo from this small, superstitious,
p144
aVmiddle-class neighborhood of my grandmother,
p145
aVI was zoomed into this
p146
aVposh, international school [in Madrid],
p147
aVwhere I was the only Turk.
p148
aVIt was here that I had my first encounter
p149
aVwith what I call the "representative foreigner."
p150
aVIn our classroom, there were children from all nationalities,
p151
aVyet this diversity did not necessarily lead
p152
aVto a cosmopolitan, egalitarian
p153
aVclassroom democracy.
p154
aVInstead, it generated an atmosphere
p155
aVin which each child was seen \u2014
p156
aVnot as an individual on his own,
p157
aVbut as the representative of something larger.
p158
aVWe were like a miniature United Nations, which was fun,
p159
aVexcept whenever something negative,
p160
aVwith regards to a nation
p161
aVor a religion, took place.
p162
aVThe child who represented it was mocked,
p163
aVridiculed and bullied endlessly.
p164
aVAnd I should know, because during the time I attended that school,
p165
aVa military takeover happened in my country,
p166
aVa gunman of my nationality nearly killed the Pope,
p167
aVand Turkey got zero points in [the] Eurovision Song Contest.
p168
aV(Laughter)
p169
aa(lp170
VI skipped school often and dreamed of becoming a sailor
p171
aVduring those days.
p172
aVI also had my first taste
p173
aVof cultural stereotypes there.
p174
aVThe other children asked me about the movie
p175
aV"Midnight Express," which I had not seen;
p176
aVthey inquired how many cigarettes a day I smoked,
p177
aVbecause they thought all Turks were heavy smokers,
p178
aVand they wondered at what age
p179
aVI would start covering my hair.
p180
aVI came to learn that these were
p181
aVthe three main stereotypes about my country:
p182
aVpolitics, cigarettes
p183
aVand the veil.
p184
aVAfter Spain, we went to Jordan, Germany
p185
aVand Ankara again.
p186
aVEverywhere I went, I felt like
p187
aVmy imagination was the only suitcase
p188
aVI could take with me.
p189
aVStories gave me a sense of center,
p190
aVcontinuity and coherence,
p191
aVthe three big Cs that I otherwise lacked.
p192
aa(lp193
VIn my mid-twenties, I moved to Istanbul,
p194
aVthe city I adore.
p195
aVI lived in a very vibrant, diverse neighborhood
p196
aVwhere I wrote several of my novels.
p197
aVI was in Istanbul when the earthquake hit
p198
aVin 1999.
p199
aVWhen I ran out of the building at three in the morning,
p200
aVI saw something that stopped me in my tracks.
p201
aVThere was the local grocer there \u2014
p202
aVa grumpy, old man who didn't sell alcohol
p203
aVand didn't speak to marginals.
p204
aVHe was sitting next to a transvestite
p205
aVwith a long black wig
p206
aVand mascara running down her cheeks.
p207
aVI watched the man open a pack of cigarettes
p208
aVwith trembling hands
p209
aVand offer one to her,
p210
aVand that is the image of the night of the earthquake
p211
aVin my mind today \u2014
p212
aVa conservative grocer and a crying transvestite
p213
aVsmoking together on the sidewalk.
p214
aVIn the face of death and destruction,
p215
aVour mundane differences evaporated,
p216
aVand we all became one
p217
aVeven if for a few hours.
p218
aVBut I've always believed that stories, too, have a similar effect on us.
p219
aVI'm not saying that fiction has the magnitude of an earthquake,
p220
aVbut when we are reading a good novel,
p221
aVwe leave our small, cozy apartments behind,
p222
aVgo out into the night alone
p223
aVand start getting to know people we had never met before
p224
aVand perhaps had even been biased against.
p225
aa(lp226
VShortly after, I went
p227
aVto a women's college in Boston, then Michigan.
p228
aVI experienced this, not so much as a geographical shift,
p229
aVas a linguistic one.
p230
aVI started writing fiction in English.
p231
aVI'm not an immigrant, refugee or exile \u2014
p232
aVthey ask me why I do this \u2014
p233
aVbut the commute between languages
p234
aVgives me the chance to recreate myself.
p235
aVI love writing in Turkish,
p236
aVwhich to me is very poetic and very emotional,
p237
aVand I love writing in English, which to me
p238
aVis very mathematical and cerebral.
p239
aVSo I feel connected to each language in a different way.
p240
aVFor me, like millions of other people
p241
aVaround the world today,
p242
aVEnglish is an acquired language.
p243
aVWhen you're a latecomer to a language,
p244
aVwhat happens is you live there
p245
aVwith a continuous
p246
aVand perpetual frustration.
p247
aVAs latecomers, we always want to say more, you know,
p248
aVcrack better jokes, say better things,
p249
aVbut we end up saying less
p250
aVbecause there's a gap between the mind and the tongue.
p251
aVAnd that gap is very intimidating.
p252
aVBut if we manage not to be frightened by it,
p253
aVit's also stimulating.
p254
aVAnd this is what I discovered in Boston \u2014
p255
aVthat frustration was very stimulating.
p256
aa(lp257
VAt this stage, my grandmother,
p258
aVwho had been watching the course of my life
p259
aVwith increasing anxiety,
p260
aVstarted to include in her daily prayers
p261
aVthat I urgently get married
p262
aVso that I could settle down once and for all.
p263
aVAnd because God loves her, I did get married.
p264
aV(Laughter)
p265
aVBut instead of settling down,
p266
aVI went to Arizona.
p267
aVAnd since my husband is in Istanbul,
p268
aVI started commuting between Arizona and Istanbul \u2014
p269
aVthe two places on the surface of earth
p270
aVthat couldn't be more different.
p271
aVI guess one part of me has always been a nomad,
p272
aVphysically and spiritually.
p273
aVStories accompany me,
p274
aVkeeping my pieces and memories together,
p275
aVlike an existential glue.
p276
aa(lp277
VYet as much as I love stories,
p278
aVrecently, I've also begun to think
p279
aVthat they lose their magic
p280
aVif and when a story is seen as more than a story.
p281
aVAnd this is a subject that I would love
p282
aVto think about together.
p283
aVWhen my first novel written in English came out in America,
p284
aVI heard an interesting remark from a literary critic.
p285
aV"I liked your book," he said, "but I wish you had written it differently."
p286
aV(Laughter)
p287
aVI asked him what he meant by that.
p288
aVHe said, "Well, look at it. There's so many
p289
aVSpanish, American, Hispanic characters in it,
p290
aVbut there's only one Turkish character and it's a man."
p291
aVNow the novel took place on a university campus in Boston,
p292
aVso to me, it was normal
p293
aVthat there be more international characters in it
p294
aVthan Turkish characters,
p295
aVbut I understood what my critic was looking for.
p296
aVAnd I also understood that I
p297
aVwould keep disappointing him.
p298
aVHe wanted to see the manifestation of my identity.
p299
aVHe was looking for a Turkish woman in the book
p300
aVbecause I happened to be one.
p301
aa(lp302
VWe often talk about how stories change the world,
p303
aVbut we should also see how the world of identity politics
p304
aVaffects the way stories
p305
aVare being circulated,
p306
aVread and reviewed.
p307
aVMany authors feel this pressure,
p308
aVbut non-Western authors feel it more heavily.
p309
aVIf you're a woman writer from the Muslim world, like me,
p310
aVthen you are expected to write
p311
aVthe stories of Muslim women
p312
aVand, preferably, the unhappy stories
p313
aVof unhappy Muslim women.
p314
aVYou're expected to write
p315
aVinformative, poignant and characteristic stories
p316
aVand leave the experimental and avant-garde
p317
aVto your Western colleagues.
p318
aVWhat I experienced as a child in that school in Madrid
p319
aVis happening in the literary world today.
p320
aVWriters are not seen
p321
aVas creative individuals on their own,
p322
aVbut as the representatives
p323
aVof their respective cultures:
p324
aVa few authors from China, a few from Turkey,
p325
aVa few from Nigeria.
p326
aVWe're all thought to have something very distinctive,
p327
aVif not peculiar.
p328
aa(lp329
VThe writer and commuter James Baldwin
p330
aVgave an interview in 1984
p331
aVin which he was repeatedly asked about his homosexuality.
p332
aVWhen the interviewer tried to pigeonhole him
p333
aVas a gay writer,
p334
aVBaldwin stopped and said,
p335
aV"But don't you see? There's nothing in me
p336
aVthat is not in everybody else,
p337
aVand nothing in everybody else
p338
aVthat is not in me."
p339
aVWhen identity politics tries to put labels on us,
p340
aVit is our freedom of imagination that is in danger.
p341
aVThere's a fuzzy category called
p342
aVmulticultural literature
p343
aVin which all authors from outside the Western world
p344
aVare lumped together.
p345
aVI never forget my first multicultural reading,
p346
aVin Harvard Square about 10 years ago.
p347
aVWe were three writers, one from the Philippines,
p348
aVone Turkish and one Indonesian \u2014
p349
aVlike a joke, you know.
p350
aV(Laughter)
p351
aVAnd the reason why we were brought together
p352
aVwas not because we shared an artistic style
p353
aVor a literary taste.
p354
aVIt was only because of our passports.
p355
aVMulticultural writers are expected to tell real stories,
p356
aVnot so much the imaginary.
p357
aVA function is attributed to fiction.
p358
aVIn this way, not only the writers themselves,
p359
aVbut also their fictional characters
p360
aVbecome the representatives of something larger.
p361
aa(lp362
VBut I must quickly add
p363
aVthat this tendency to see a story
p364
aVas more than a story
p365
aVdoes not solely come from the West.
p366
aVIt comes from everywhere.
p367
aVAnd I experienced this firsthand
p368
aVwhen I was put on trial in 2005
p369
aVfor the words my fictional characters uttered in a novel.
p370
aVI had intended to write
p371
aVa constructive, multi-layered novel
p372
aVabout an Armenian and a Turkish family
p373
aVthrough the eyes of women.
p374
aVMy micro story became a macro issue
p375
aVwhen I was prosecuted.
p376
aVSome people criticized, others praised me
p377
aVfor writing about the Turkish-Armenian conflict.
p378
aVBut there were times when I wanted to remind both sides
p379
aVthat this was fiction.
p380
aVIt was just a story.
p381
aVAnd when I say, "just a story,"
p382
aVI'm not trying to belittle my work.
p383
aVI want to love and celebrate fiction
p384
aVfor what it is,
p385
aVnot as a means to an end.
p386
aa(lp387
VWriters are entitled to their political opinions,
p388
aVand there are good political novels out there,
p389
aVbut the language of fiction
p390
aVis not the language of daily politics.
p391
aVChekhov said,
p392
aV"The solution to a problem
p393
aVand the correct way of posing the question
p394
aVare two completely separate things.
p395
aVAnd only the latter is an artist's responsibility."
p396
aVIdentity politics divides us. Fiction connects.
p397
aVOne is interested in sweeping generalizations.
p398
aVThe other, in nuances.
p399
aVOne draws boundaries.
p400
aVThe other recognizes no frontiers.
p401
aVIdentity politics is made of solid bricks.
p402
aVFiction is flowing water.
p403
aa(lp404
VIn the Ottoman times, there were itinerant storytellers called "meddah."
p405
aVThey would go to coffee houses,
p406
aVwhere they would tell a story in front of an audience,
p407
aVoften improvising.
p408
aVWith each new person in the story,
p409
aVthe meddah would change his voice,
p410
aVimpersonating that character.
p411
aVEverybody could go and listen, you know \u2014
p412
aVordinary people, even the sultan, Muslims and non-Muslims.
p413
aVStories cut across all boundaries,
p414
aVlike "The Tales of Nasreddin Hodja,"
p415
aVwhich were very popular throughout the Middle East,
p416
aVNorth Africa, the Balkans and Asia.
p417
aVToday, stories continue
p418
aVto transcend borders.
p419
aVWhen Palestinian and Israeli politicians talk,
p420
aVthey usually don't listen to each other,
p421
aVbut a Palestinian reader
p422
aVstill reads a novel by a Jewish author,
p423
aVand vice versa, connecting and empathizing
p424
aVwith the narrator.
p425
aVLiterature has to take us beyond.
p426
aVIf it cannot take us there,
p427
aVit is not good literature.
p428
aa(lp429
VBooks have saved the introverted,
p430
aVtimid child that I was \u2014 that I once was.
p431
aVBut I'm also aware of the danger
p432
aVof fetishizing them.
p433
aVWhen the poet and mystic, Rumi,
p434
aVmet his spiritual companion, Shams of Tabriz,
p435
aVone of the first things the latter did
p436
aVwas to toss Rumi's books into water
p437
aVand watch the letters dissolve.
p438
aVThe Sufis say, "Knowledge that takes you not beyond yourself
p439
aVis far worse than ignorance."
p440
aVThe problem with today's cultural ghettos
p441
aVis not lack of knowledge \u2014
p442
aVwe know a lot about each other, or so we think \u2014
p443
aVbut knowledge that takes us not beyond ourselves:
p444
aVit makes us elitist,
p445
aVdistant and disconnected.
p446
aVThere's a metaphor which I love:
p447
aVliving like a drawing compass.
p448
aVAs you know, one leg of the compass is static, rooted in a place.
p449
aVMeanwhile, the other leg
p450
aVdraws a wide circle, constantly moving.
p451
aVLike that, my fiction as well.
p452
aVOne part of it is rooted in Istanbul,
p453
aVwith strong Turkish roots,
p454
aVbut the other part travels the world,
p455
aVconnecting to different cultures.
p456
aVIn that sense, I like to think of my fiction
p457
aVas both local and universal,
p458
aVboth from here and everywhere.
p459
aa(lp460
VNow those of you who have been to Istanbul
p461
aVhave probably seen Topkapi Palace,
p462
aVwhich was the residence of Ottoman sultans
p463
aVfor more than 400 years.
p464
aVIn the palace, just outside the quarters
p465
aVof the favorite concubines,
p466
aVthere's an area called The Gathering Place of the Djinn.
p467
aVIt's between buildings.
p468
aVI'm intrigued by this concept.
p469
aVWe usually distrust those areas
p470
aVthat fall in between things.
p471
aVWe see them as the domain
p472
aVof supernatural creatures like the djinn,
p473
aVwho are made of smokeless fire
p474
aVand are the symbol of elusiveness.
p475
aVBut my point is perhaps
p476
aVthat elusive space
p477
aVis what writers and artists need most.
p478
aVWhen I write fiction
p479
aVI cherish elusiveness and changeability.
p480

p491
aV"The white fathers taught us to say,
p492
aV'I think, therefore I am.'"

aV"Come, let us be friends for once;
p516
aVlet us make life easy on us;
