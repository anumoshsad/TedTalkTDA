VAcross Europe and Central Asia,
p4
aVapproximately one million children live in large
p5
aVresidential institutions, usually known as orphanages.
p6
aVMost people imagine orphanages as a benign environment
p7
aVthat care for children.
p8
aVOthers know more about the living conditions there,
p9
aVbut still think they're a necessary evil.
p10
aVAfter all, where else would we put all of those children
p11
aVwho don't have any parents?
p12
aa(lp13
VBut 60 years of research has demonstrated
p14
aVthat separating children from their families
p15
aVand placing them in large institutions
p16
aVseriously harms their health and development,
p17
aVand this is particularly true for young babies.
p18
aVAs we know, babies are born
p19
aVwithout their full muscle development,
p20
aVand that includes the brain.
p21
aVDuring the first three years of life, the brain grows
p22
aVto its full size, with most of that growth taking place
p23
aVin the first six months. The brain develops
p24
aVin response to experience and to stimulation.
p25
aVEvery time a young baby learns something new \u2014
p26
aVto focus its eyes,
p27
aVto mimic a movement or a facial expression,
p28
aVto pick something up, to form a word or to sit up \u2014
p29
aVnew synaptic connections are being built in the brain.
p30
aVNew parents are astonished by the rapidity of this learning.
p31
aVThey are quite rightly amazed and delighted by their children's cleverness.
p32
aVThey communicate their delight to their children,
p33
aVwho respond with smiles,
p34
aVand a desire to achieve more and to learn more.
p35
aVThis forming of the powerful attachment between child and parent
p36
aVprovides the building blocks for physical, social,
p37
aVlanguage, cognitive and psychomotor development.
p38
aVIt is the model for all future relationships with friends,
p39
aVwith partners and with their own children.
p40
aVIt happens so naturally in most families
p41
aVthat we don't even notice it. Most of us are unaware
p42
aVof its importance to human development and, by extension,
p43
aVto the development of a healthy society.
p44
aVAnd it's only when it goes wrong that we start to realize
p45
aVthe importance of families to children.
p46
aa(lp47
VIn August, 1993, I had my first opportunity to witness
p48
aVon a massive scale the impact on children
p49
aVof institutionalization and the absence of parenting.
p50
aVThose of us who remember the newspaper reports
p51
aVthat came out of Romania after the 1989 revolution
p52
aVwill recall the horrors of the conditions in some of those institutions.
p53
aVI was asked to help the director of a large institution to
p54
aVhelp prevent the separation of children from their families.
p55
aVHousing 550 babies, this was Ceausescu's show orphanage,
p56
aVand so I'd been told the conditions were much better.
p57
aVHaving worked with lots of young children, I expected
p58
aVthe institution to be a riot of noise,
p59
aVbut it was as silent as a convent.
p60
aVIt was hard to believe there were any children there at all,
p61
aVyet the director showed me into room after room,
p62
aVeach containing row upon row of cots,
p63
aVin each of which lay a child staring into space.
p64
aVIn a room of 40 newborns, not one of them was crying.
p65
aVYet I could see soiled nappies, and I could see
p66
aVthat some of the children were distressed,
p67
aVbut the only noise was a low, continuous moan.
p68
aVThe head nurse told me proudly,
p69
aV"You see, our children are very well-behaved."
p70
aVOver the next few days, I began to realize
p71
aVthat this quietness was not exceptional.
p72
aVThe newly admitted babies would cry for the first few hours,
p73
aVbut their demands were not met, and so eventually
p74
aVthey learned not to bother. Within a few days,
p75
aVthey were listless, lethargic, and staring into space
p76
aVlike all the others.
p77
aa(lp78
VOver the years, many people and news reports
p79
aVhave blamed the personnel in the institutions
p80
aVfor the harm caused to the children, but often, one member
p81
aVof staff is caring for 10, 20, and even 40 children.
p82
aVHence they have no option but to implement a regimented program.
p83
aVThe children must be woken at 7 and fed at 7:30.
p84
aVAt 8, their nappies must be changed, so a staff member
p85
aVmay have only 30 minutes to feed 10 or 20 children.
p86
aVIf a child soils its nappy at 8:30, he will have to wait
p87
aVseveral hours before it can be changed again.
p88
aVThe child's daily contact with another human being
p89
aVis reduced to a few hurried minutes of feeding and changing,
p90
aVand otherwise their only stimulation is the ceiling,
p91
aVthe walls or the bars of their cots.
p92
aa(lp93
VSince my first visit to Ceausescu's institution,
p94
aVI've seen hundreds of such places across 18 countries,
p95
aVfrom the Czech Republic to Sudan.
p96
aVAcross all of these diverse lands and cultures,
p97
aVthe institutions, and the child's journey through them,
p98
aVis depressingly similar.
p99
aVLack of stimulation often leads to self-stimulating behaviors
p100
aVlike hand-flapping, rocking back and forth,
p101
aVor aggression, and in some institutions, psychiatric drugs
p102
aVare used to control the behavior of these children,
p103
aVwhilst in others, children are tied up to prevent them
p104
aVfrom harming themselves or others.
p105
aVThese children are quickly labeled as having disabilities
p106
aVand transferred to another institution for children with disabilities.
p107
aVMost of these children will never leave the institution again.
p108
aVFor those without disabilities, at age three,
p109
aVthey're transferred to another institution, and at age seven,
p110
aVto yet another. Segregated according to age and gender,
p111
aVthey are arbitrarily separated from their siblings,
p112
aVoften without even a chance to say goodbye.
p113
aVThere's rarely enough to eat. They are often hungry.
p114
aVThe older children bully the little ones. They learn to
p115
aVsurvive. They learn to defend themselves, or they go under.
p116
aa(lp117
VWhen they leave the institution, they find it really difficult
p118
aVto cope and to integrate into society.
p119
aVIn Moldova, young women raised in institutions
p120
aVare 10 times more likely to be trafficked than their peers,
p121
aVand a Russian study found that two years after leaving institutions,
p122
aVyoung adults, 20 percent of them had a criminal record,
p123
aV14 percent were involved in prostitution,
p124
aVand 10 percent had taken their own lives.
p125
aa(lp126
VBut why are there so many orphans in Europe
p127
aVwhen there hasn't been a great deal of war or disaster in recent years?
p128
aVIn fact, more than 95 percent of these children have living parents,
p129
aVand societies tend to blame these parents
p130
aVfor abandoning these children, but research shows that
p131
aVmost parents want their children, and that the primary drivers
p132
aVbehind institutionalization
p133
aVare poverty, disability and ethnicity.
p134
aVMany countries have not developed inclusive schools,
p135
aVand so even children with a very mild disability
p136
aVare sent away to a residential special school,
p137
aVat age six or seven.
p138
aVThe institution may be hundreds of miles away from the family home.
p139
aVIf the family's poor, they find it difficult to visit,
p140
aVand gradually the relationship breaks down.
p141
aVBehind each of the million children in institutions,
p142
aVthere is usually a story of parents who are desperate
p143
aVand feel they've run out of options, like Natalia in Moldova,
p144
aVwho only had enough money to feed her baby,
p145
aVand so had to send her older son to the institution;
p146
aVor Desi, in Bulgaria, who looked after her four children
p147
aVat home until her husband died,
p148
aVbut then she had to go out to work full time,
p149
aVand with no support, felt she had no option
p150
aVbut to place a child with disabilities in an institution;
p151
aVor the countless young girls too terrified to tell their parents
p152
aVthey're pregnant, who leave their babies in a hospital;
p153
aVor the new parents, the young couple who have
p154
aVjust found out that their firstborn child has a disability,
p155
aVand instead of being provided with positive messages
p156
aVabout their child's potential, are told by the doctors,
p157
aV"Forget her, leave her in the institution,
p158
aVgo home and make a healthy one."
p159
aa(lp160
VThis state of affairs is neither necessary nor is it inevitable.
p161
aVEvery child has the right to a family, deserves
p162
aVand needs a family, and children are amazingly resilient.
p163
aVWe find that if we get them out of institutions and into loving
p164
aVfamilies early on, they recover their developmental delays,
p165
aVand go on to lead normal, happy lives.
p166
aVIt's also much cheaper to provide support to families
p167
aVthan it is to provide institutions.
p168
aVOne study suggests that a family support service
p169
aVcosts 10 percent of an institutional placement,
p170
aVwhilst good quality foster care
p171
aVcosts usually about 30 percent.
p172
aVIf we spend less on these children but on the right services,
p173
aVwe can take the savings and reinvest them in high quality
p174
aVresidential care for those few children with extremely complex needs.
p175
aa(lp176
VAcross Europe, a movement is growing to shift the focus
p177
aVand transfer the resources from large institutions
p178
aVthat provide poor quality care to community-based services
p179
aVthat protect children from harm and allow them to develop
p180
aVto their full potential. When I first started to work in Romania
p181
aVnearly 20 years ago, there were 200,000 children living
p182
aVin institutions, and more entering every day.
p183
aVNow, there are less than 10,000, and
p184
aVfamily support services are provided across the country.
p185
aVIn Moldova, despite extreme poverty and the terrible effects
p186
aVof the global financial crisis, the numbers of children
p187
aVin institutions has reduced by more than 50 percent
p188
aVin the last five years, and the resources are being
p189
aVredistributed to family support services and inclusive schools.
p190
aVMany countries have developed national action plans for change.
p191
aVThe European Commission and other major donors
p192
aVare finding ways to divert money from institutions
p193
aVtowards family support, empowering communities
p194
aVto look after their own children.
p195
aa(lp196
VBut there is still much to be done to end the systematic
p197
aVinstitutionalization of children.
p198
aVAwareness-raising is required at every level of society.
p199
aVPeople need to know the harm that institutions cause to children,
p200
aVand the better alternatives that exist.
p201
aVIf we know people who are planning to support orphanages,
p202
aVwe should convince them to support family services instead.
p203
aa(lp204
VTogether, this is the one form of child abuse
p205
aVthat we could eradicate in our lifetime.
