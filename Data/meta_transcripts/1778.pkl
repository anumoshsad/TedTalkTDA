VGood morning.
p4
aVMy name is Eric Li, and I was born here.
p5
aVBut no, I wasn't born there.
p6
aVThis was where I was born:
p7
aVShanghai, at the height of the Cultural Revolution.
p8
aVMy grandmother tells me that she heard
p9
aVthe sound of gunfire along with my first cries.
p10
aVWhen I was growing up, I was told a story
p11
aVthat explained all I ever needed to know about humanity.
p12
aVIt went like this.
p13
aVAll human societies develop in linear progression,
p14
aVbeginning with primitive society, then slave society,
p15
aVfeudalism, capitalism, socialism,
p16
aVand finally, guess where we end up?
p17
aVCommunism!
p18
aVSooner or later, all of humanity,
p19
aVregardless of culture, language, nationality,
p20
aVwill arrive at this final stage
p21
aVof political and social development.
p22
aVThe entire world's peoples will be unified
p23
aVin this paradise on Earth
p24
aVand live happily ever after.
p25
aVBut before we get there, we're engaged
p26
aVin a struggle between good and evil,
p27
aVthe good of socialism against the evil of capitalism,
p28
aVand the good shall triumph.
p29
aVThat, of course, was the meta-narrative
p30
aVdistilled from the theories of Karl Marx.
p31
aVAnd the Chinese bought it.
p32
aVWe were taught that grand story day in and day out.
p33
aVIt became part of us, and we believed in it.
p34
aVThe story was a bestseller.
p35
aVAbout one third of the entire world's population
p36
aVlived under that meta-narrative.
p37
aVThen, the world changed overnight.
p38
aVAs for me, disillusioned by the failed religion of my youth,
p39
aVI went to America and became a Berkeley hippie.
p40
aV(Laughter)
p41
aVNow, as I was coming of age, something else happened.
p42
aVAs if one big story wasn't enough,
p43
aVI was told another one.
p44
aVThis one was just as grand.
p45
aVIt also claims that all human societies
p46
aVdevelop in a linear progression towards a singular end.
p47
aVThis one went as follows:
p48
aVAll societies, regardless of culture,
p49
aVbe it Christian, Muslim, Confucian,
p50
aVmust progress from traditional societies
p51
aVin which groups are the basic units
p52
aVto modern societies in which atomized individuals
p53
aVare the sovereign units,
p54
aVand all these individuals are, by definition, rational,
p55
aVand they all want one thing:
p56
aVthe vote.
p57
aVBecause they are all rational, once given the vote,
p58
aVthey produce good government
p59
aVand live happily ever after.
p60
aVParadise on Earth, again.
p61
aVSooner or later, electoral democracy will be
p62
aVthe only political system for all countries and all peoples,
p63
aVwith a free market to make them all rich.
p64
aVBut before we get there, we're engaged in a struggle
p65
aVbetween good and evil.
p66
aV(Laughter)
p67
aVThe good belongs to those who are democracies
p68
aVand are charged with a mission of spreading it
p69
aVaround the globe, sometimes by force,
p70
aVagainst the evil of those who do not hold elections.
p71
aV(Video) George H.W. Bush: A new world order...
p72
aV(Video) George W. Bush:... ending tyranny in our world...
p73
aV(Video) Barack Obama:... a single standard for all
p74
aVwho would hold power.
p75
aVEric X. Li: Now \u2014
p76
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p77
aVThis story also became a bestseller.
p78
aVAccording to Freedom House,
p79
aVthe number of democracies went from 45 in 1970
p80
aVto 115 in 2010.
p81
aVIn the last 20 years, Western elites tirelessly
p82
aVtrotted around the globe selling this prospectus:
p83
aVMultiple parties fight for political power
p84
aVand everyone voting on them
p85
aVis the only path to salvation
p86
aVto the long-suffering developing world.
p87
aVThose who buy the prospectus are destined for success.
p88
aVThose who do not are doomed to fail.
p89
aVBut this time, the Chinese didn't buy it.
p90
aVFool me once...
p91
aV(Laughter)
p92
aVThe rest is history.
p93
aVIn just 30 years, China went from
p94
aVone of the poorest agricultural countries in the world
p95
aVto its second-largest economy.
p96
aVSix hundred fifty million people
p97
aVwere lifted out of poverty.
p98
aVEighty percent of the entire world's poverty alleviation
p99
aVduring that period happened in China.
p100
aVIn other words, all the new and old democracies
p101
aVput together amounted to a mere fraction
p102
aVof what a single, one-party state did without voting.
p103
aVSee, I grew up on this stuff: food stamps.
p104
aVMeat was rationed to a few hundred grams
p105
aVper person per month at one point.
p106
aVNeedless to say, I ate all my grandmother's portions.
p107
aVSo I asked myself, what's wrong with this picture?
p108
aVHere I am in my hometown,
p109
aVmy business growing leaps and bounds.
p110
aVEntrepreneurs are starting companies every day.
p111
aVMiddle class is expanding in speed and scale
p112
aVunprecedented in human history.
p113
aVYet, according to the grand story,
p114
aVnone of this should be happening.
p115
aVSo I went and did the only thing I could. I studied it.
p116
aVYes, China is a one-party state
p117
aVrun by the Chinese Communist Party, the Party,
p118
aVand they don't hold elections.
p119
aVThree assumptions are made
p120
aVby the dominant political theories of our time.
p121
aVSuch a system is operationally rigid,
p122
aVpolitically closed, and morally illegitimate.
p123
aVWell, the assumptions are wrong.
p124
aVThe opposites are true.
p125
aVAdaptability, meritocracy, and legitimacy
p126
aVare the three defining characteristics
p127
aVof China's one-party system.
p128
aVNow, most political scientists will tell us
p129
aVthat a one-party system is inherently incapable
p130
aVof self-correction.
p131
aVIt won't last long because it cannot adapt.
p132
aVNow here are the facts.
p133
aVIn 64 years of running the largest country in the world,
p134
aVthe range of the Party's policies has been wider
p135
aVthan any other country in recent memory,
p136
aVfrom radical land collectivization to the Great Leap Forward,
p137
aVthen privatization of farmland,
p138
aVthen the Cultural Revolution,
p139
aVthen Deng Xiaoping's market reform,
p140
aVthen successor Jiang Zemin took the giant political step
p141
aVof opening up Party membership to private businesspeople,
p142
aVsomething unimaginable during Mao's rule.
p143
aVSo the Party self-corrects in rather dramatic fashions.
p144
aVInstitutionally, new rules get enacted
p145
aVto correct previous dysfunctions.
p146
aVFor example, term limits.
p147
aVPolitical leaders used to retain their positions for life,
p148
aVand they used that to accumulate power
p149
aVand perpetuate their rules.
p150
aVMao was the father of modern China,
p151
aVyet his prolonged rule led to disastrous mistakes.
p152
aVSo the Party instituted term limits
p153
aVwith mandatory retirement age of 68 to 70.
p154
aVOne thing we often hear is,
p155
aV"Political reforms have lagged far behind economic reforms,"
p156
aVand "China is in dire need of political reform."
p157
aVBut this claim is a rhetorical trap
p158
aVhidden behind a political bias.
p159
aVSee, some have decided a priori
p160
aVwhat kinds of changes they want to see,
p161
aVand only such changes can be called political reform.
p162
aVThe truth is, political reforms have never stopped.
p163
aVCompared with 30 years ago, 20 years, even 10 years ago,
p164
aVevery aspect of Chinese society,
p165
aVhow the country is governed,
p166
aVfrom the most local level to the highest center,
p167
aVare unrecognizable today.
p168
aVNow such changes are simply not possible
p169
aVwithout political reforms of the most fundamental kind.
p170
aVNow I would venture to suggest the Party
p171
aVis the world's leading expert in political reform.
p172
aVThe second assumption is that in a one-party state,
p173
aVpower gets concentrated in the hands of the few,
p174
aVand bad governance and corruption follow.
p175
aVIndeed, corruption is a big problem,
p176
aVbut let's first look at the larger context.
p177
aVNow, this may be counterintuitive to you.
p178
aVThe Party happens to be one of the most meritocratic
p179
aVpolitical institutions in the world today.
p180
aVChina's highest ruling body, the Politburo, has 25 members.
p181
aVIn the most recent one, only five of them
p182
aVcame from a background of privilege, so-called princelings.
p183
aVThe other 20, including the president and the premier,
p184
aVcame from entirely ordinary backgrounds.
p185
aVIn the larger central committee of 300 or more,
p186
aVthe percentage of those who were born
p187
aVinto power and wealth was even smaller.
p188
aVThe vast majority of senior Chinese leaders
p189
aVworked and competed their way to the top.
p190
aVCompare that with the ruling elites
p191
aVin both developed and developing countries,
p192
aVI think you'll find the Party being near the top
p193
aVin upward mobility.
p194
aVThe question then is, how could that be possible
p195
aVin a system run by one party?
p196
aVNow we come to a powerful political institution,
p197
aVlittle-known to Westerners:
p198
aVthe Party's Organization Department.
p199
aVThe department functions like a giant
p200
aVhuman resource engine that would be the envy
p201
aVof even some of the most successful corporations.
p202
aVIt operates a rotating pyramid
p203
aVmade up of three components:
p204
aVcivil service, state-owned enterprises,
p205
aVand social organizations like a university
p206
aVor a community program.
p207
aVThey form separate yet integrated career paths
p208
aVfor Chinese officials.
p209
aVThey recruit college grads into entry-level positions
p210
aVin all three tracks, and they start from the bottom,
p211
aVcalled "keyuan" [clerk].
p212
aVThen they could get promoted
p213
aVthrough four increasingly elite ranks:
p214
aVfuke [deputy section manager], ke [section manager], fuchu [deputy division manager], and chu [division manger].
p215
aVNow these are not moves from "Karate Kid," okay?
p216
aVIt's serious business.
p217
aVThe range of positions is wide,
p218
aVfrom running health care in a village
p219
aVto foreign investment in a city district
p220
aVto manager in a company.
p221
aVOnce a year, the department reviews their performance.
p222
aVThey interview their superiors, their peers,
p223
aVtheir subordinates. They vet their personal conduct.
p224
aVThey conduct public opinion surveys.
p225
aVThen they promote the winners.
p226
aVThroughout their careers, these cadres
p227
aVcan move through and out of all three tracks.
p228
aVOver time, the good ones move beyond the four base levels
p229
aVto the fuju [deputy bureau chief] and ju [bureau chief] levels.
p230
aVThere, they enter high officialdom.
p231
aVBy that point, a typical assignment will be
p232
aVto manage a district with a population in the millions
p233
aVor a company with hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue.
p234
aVJust to show you how competitive the system is,
p235
aVin 2012, there were 900,000 fuke and ke levels,
p236
aV600,000 fuchu and chu levels,
p237
aVand only 40,000 fuju and ju levels.
p238
aVAfter the ju levels,
p239
aVthe best few move further up several more ranks,
p240
aVand eventually make it to the Central Committee.
p241
aVThe process takes two to three decades.
p242
aVDoes patronage play a role? Yes, of course.
p243
aVBut merit remains the fundamental driver.
p244
aVIn essence, the Organization Department runs
p245
aVa modernized version of China's centuries-old
p246
aVmentoring system.
p247
aVChina's new president, Xi Jinping,
p248
aVis the son of a former leader, which is very unusual,
p249
aVfirst of his kind to make the top job.
p250
aVEven for him, the career took 30 years.
p251
aVHe started as a village manager,
p252
aVand by the time he entered the Politburo,
p253
aVhe had managed areas with a total population
p254
aVof 150 million people
p255
aVand combined GDPs of 1.5 trillion U.S. dollars.
p256
aVNow, please don't get me wrong, okay?
p257
aVThis is not a put-down of anyone. It's just a statement of fact.
p258
aVGeorge W. Bush, remember him?
p259
aVThis is not a put-down.
p260
aV(Laughter)
p261
aVBefore becoming governor of Texas,
p262
aVor Barack Obama before running for president,
p263
aVcould not make even a small county manager
p264
aVin China's system.
p265
aVWinston Churchill once said that democracy
p266
aVis a terrible system except for all the rest.
p267
aVWell, apparently he hadn't heard of the Organization Department.
p268
aVNow, Westerners always assume that
p269
aVmulti-party election with universal suffrage
p270
aVis the only source of political legitimacy.
p271
aVI was asked once, "The Party wasn't voted in by election.
p272
aVWhere is the source of legitimacy?"
p273
aVI said, "How about competency?"
p274
aVWe all know the facts.
p275
aVIn 1949, when the Party took power,
p276
aVChina was mired in civil wars, dismembered by foreign aggression,
p277
aVaverage life expectancy at that time, 41 years old.
p278
aVToday, it's the second largest economy in the world,
p279
aVan industrial powerhouse, and its people live
p280
aVin increasing prosperity.
p281
aVPew Research polls Chinese public attitudes,
p282
aVand here are the numbers in recent years.
p283
aVSatisfaction with the direction of the country: 85 percent.
p284
aVThose who think they're better off than five years ago:
p285
aV70 percent.
p286
aVThose who expect the future to be better:
p287
aVa whopping 82 percent.
p288
aVFinancial Times polls global youth attitudes,
p289
aVand these numbers, brand new, just came from last week.
p290
aVNinety-three percent of China's Generation Y
p291
aVare optimistic about their country's future.
p292
aVNow, if this is not legitimacy, I'm not sure what is.
p293
aVIn contrast, most electoral democracies around the world
p294
aVare suffering from dismal performance.
p295
aVI don't need to elaborate for this audience
p296
aVhow dysfunctional it is, from Washington to European capitals.
p297
aVWith a few exceptions, the vast number
p298
aVof developing countries that have adopted electoral regimes
p299
aVare still suffering from poverty and civil strife.
p300
aVGovernments get elected, and then they fall
p301
aVbelow 50 percent approval in a few months
p302
aVand stay there and get worse until the next election.
p303
aVDemocracy is becoming a perpetual cycle
p304
aVof elect and regret.
p305
aVAt this rate, I'm afraid it is democracy,
p306
aVnot China's one-party system, that is in danger
p307
aVof losing legitimacy.
p308
aVNow, I don't want to create the misimpression
p309
aVthat China's hunky-dory, on the way
p310
aVto some kind of superpowerdom.
p311
aVThe country faces enormous challenges.
p312
aVThe social and economic problems that come
p313
aVwith wrenching change like this are mind-boggling.
p314
aVPollution is one. Food safety. Population issues.
p315
aVOn the political front, the worst problem is corruption.
p316
aVCorruption is widespread and undermines the system
p317
aVand its moral legitimacy.
p318
aVBut most analysts misdiagnose the disease.
p319
aVThey say that corruption is the result of the one-party system,
p320
aVand therefore, in order to cure it,
p321
aVyou have to do away with the entire system.
p322
aVBut a more careful look would tell us otherwise.
p323
aVTransparency International ranks China
p324
aVbetween 70 and 80 in recent years among 170 countries,
p325
aVand it's been moving up.
p326
aVIndia, the largest democracy in the world,
p327
aV94 and dropping.
p328
aVFor the hundred or so countries that are ranked below China,
p329
aVmore than half of them are electoral democracies.
p330
aVSo if election is the panacea for corruption,
p331
aVhow come these countries can't fix it?
p332
aVNow, I'm a venture capitalist. I make bets.
p333
aVIt wouldn't be fair to end this talk without
p334
aVputting myself on the line and making some predictions.
p335
aVSo here they are.
p336
aVIn the next 10 years, China will surpass the U.S.
p337
aVand become the largest economy in the world.
p338
aVIncome per capita will be near the top
p339
aVof all developing countries.
p340
aVCorruption will be curbed, but not eliminated,
p341
aVand China will move up 10 to 20 notches
p342
aVto above 60 in T.I. ranking.
p343
aVEconomic reform will accelerate, political reform will continue,
p344
aVand the one-party system will hold firm.
p345
aVWe live in the dusk of an era.
p346
aVMeta-narratives that make universal claims
p347
aVfailed us in the 20th century
p348
aVand are failing us in the 21st.
p349
aVMeta-narrative is the cancer
p350
aVthat is killing democracy from the inside.
p351
aVNow, I want to clarify something.
p352
aVI'm not here to make an indictment of democracy.
p353
aVOn the contrary, I think democracy contributed
p354
aVto the rise of the West and the creation of the modern world.
p355
aVIt is the universal claim that many Western elites
p356
aVare making about their political system, the hubris,
p357
aVthat is at the heart of the West's current ills.
p358
aVIf they would spend just a little less time
p359
aVon trying to force their way onto others,
p360
aVand a little bit more on political reform at home,
p361
aVthey might give their democracy a better chance.
p362
aVChina's political model will never supplant
p363
aVelectoral democracy, because unlike the latter,
p364
aVit doesn't pretend to be universal.
p365
aVIt cannot be exported. But that is the point precisely.
p366
aVThe significance of China's example
p367
aVis not that it provides an alternative,
p368
aVbut the demonstration that alternatives exist.
p369
aVLet us draw to a close this era of meta-narratives.
p370
aVCommunism and democracy may both be laudable ideals,
p371
aVbut the era of their dogmatic universalism is over.
p372
aVLet us stop telling people and our children
p373
aVthere's only one way to govern ourselves
p374
aVand a singular future towards which
p375
aVall societies must evolve.
p376
aVIt is wrong. It is irresponsible.
p377
aVAnd worst of all, it is boring.
p378
aVLet universality make way for plurality.
p379
aVPerhaps a more interesting age is upon us.
p380
aVAre we brave enough to welcome it?
p381
aVThank you.
p382
aV(Applause)
p383
aVThank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks.
p384
aVBruno Giussani: Eric, stay with me for a couple of minutes,
p385
aVbecause I want to ask you a couple of questions.
p386
aVI think many here, and in general in Western countries,
p387
aVwould agree with your statement about analysis
p388
aVof democratic systems becoming dysfunctional,
p389
aVbut at the same time, many would kind of find
p390
aVunsettling the thought that there is an unelected
p391
aVauthority that, without any form of oversight or consultation,
p392
aVdecides what the national interest is.
p393
aVWhat is the mechanism in the Chinese model
p394
aVthat allows people to say, actually,
p395
aVthe national interest as you defined it is wrong?
p396
aVEXL: You know, Frank Fukuyama, the political scientist,
p397
aVcalled the Chinese system "responsive authoritarianism."
p398
aVIt's not exactly right, but I think it comes close.
p399
aVSo I know the largest public opinion survey company
p400
aVin China, okay?
p401
aVDo you know who their biggest client is?
p402
aVThe Chinese government.
p403
aVNot just from the central government,
p404
aVthe city government, the provincial government,
p405
aVto the most local neighborhood districts.
p406
aVThey conduct surveys all the time.
p407
aVAre you happy with the garbage collection?
p408
aVAre you happy with the general direction of the country?
p409
aVSo there is, in China, there is a different kind of mechanism
p410
aVto be responsive to the demands and the thinking of the people.
p411
aVMy point is, I think we should get unstuck
p412
aVfrom the thinking that there's only one political system \u2014
p413
aVelection, election, election \u2014
p414
aVthat could make it responsive.
p415
aVI'm not sure, actually, elections produce
p416
aVresponsive government anymore in the world.
p417
aV(Applause)
p418
aVBG: Many seem to agree.
p419
aVOne of the features of a democratic system
p420
aVis a space for civil society to express itself.
p421
aVAnd you have shown figures about the support
p422
aVthat the government and the authorities have in China.
p423
aVBut then you've just mentioned other elements
p424
aVlike, you know, big challenges, and there are, of course,
p425
aVa lot of other data that go in a different direction:
p426
aVtens of thousands of unrests and protests
p427
aVand environmental protests, etc.
p428
aVSo you seem to suggest the Chinese model
p429
aVdoesn't have a space outside of the Party
p430
aVfor civil society to express itself.
p431
aVEXL: There's a vibrant civil society in China,
p432
aVwhether it's environment or what-have-you.
p433
aVBut it's different. You wouldn't recognize it.
p434
aVBecause, by Western definitions, a so-called civil society
p435
aVhas to be separate or even in opposition
p436
aVto the political system,
p437
aVbut that concept is alien for Chinese culture.
p438
aVFor thousands of years, you have civil society,
p439
aVyet they are consistent and coherent
p440
aVand part of a political order, and I think
p441
aVit's a big cultural difference.
