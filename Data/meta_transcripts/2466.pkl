VWhen I was seven years old,
p4
aVsome well-meaning adult asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up.
p5
aVProudly, I said: "An artist."
p6
aV"No, you don't," he said,
p7
aV"You can't make a living being an artist!"
p8
aa(lp9
VMy little seven-year-old Picasso dreams were crushed.
p10
aVBut I gathered myself,
p11
aVwent off in search of a new dream,
p12
aVeventually settling on being a scientist,
p13
aVperhaps something like the next Albert Einstein.
p14
aa(lp15
V(Laughter)
p16
aa(lp17
VI have always loved math and science,
p18
aVlater, coding.
p19
aVAnd so I decided to study computer programming in college.
p20
aVIn my junior year,
p21
aVmy computer graphics professor showed us these wonderful short films.
p22
aVIt was the first computer animation any of us had ever seen.
p23
aVI watched these films in wonder, transfixed,
p24
aVfireworks going off in my head,
p25
aVthinking, "That is what I want to do with my life."
p26
aVThe idea that all the math, science and code I had been learning
p27
aVcould come together to create these worlds and characters
p28
aVand stories I connected with,
p29
aVwas pure magic for me.
p30
aa(lp31
VJust two years later, I started working
p32
aVat the place that made those films, Pixar Animation Studios.
p33
aVIt was here I learned how we actually execute those films.
p34
aVTo create our movies,
p35
aVwe create a three-dimensional world inside the computer.
p36
aVWe start with a point that makes a line that makes a face
p37
aVthat creates characters,
p38
aVor trees and rocks that eventually become a forest.
p39
aVAnd because it's a three-dimensional world,
p40
aVwe can move a camera around inside that world.
p41
aVI was fascinated by all of it.
p42
aVBut then I got my first taste of lighting.
p43
aa(lp44
VLighting in practice is placing lights inside this three-dimensional world.
p45
aVI actually have icons of lights I move around in there.
p46
aVHere you can see I've added a light,
p47
aVI'm turning on the rough version of lighting in our software,
p48
aVturn on shadows
p49
aVand placing the light.
p50
aVAs I place a light,
p51
aVI think about what it might look like in real life,
p52
aVbut balance that out with what we need artistically and for the story.
p53
aVSo it might look like this at first,
p54
aVbut as we adjust this and move that
p55
aVin weeks of work,
p56
aVin rough form it might look like this,
p57
aVand in final form, like this.
p58
aa(lp59
VThere's this moment in lighting that made me fall utterly in love with it.
p60
aVIt's where we go from this
p61
aVto this.
p62
aVIt's the moment where all the pieces come together,
p63
aVand suddenly the world comes to life
p64
aVas if it's an actual place that exists.
p65
aVThis moment never gets old,
p66
aVespecially for that little seven-year-old girl that wanted to be an artist.
p67
aa(lp68
VAs I learned to light,
p69
aVI learned about using light to help tell story,
p70
aVto set the time of day,
p71
aVto create the mood,
p72
aVto guide the audience's eye,
p73
aVhow to make a character look appealing
p74
aVor stand out in a busy set.
p75
aa(lp76
VDid you see WALL-E?
p77
aa(lp78
V(Laughter)
p79
aa(lp80
VThere he is.
p81
aa(lp82
VAs you can see,
p83
aVwe can create any world that we want inside the computer.
p84
aVWe can make a world with monsters,
p85
aVwith robots that fall in love,
p86
aVwe can even make pigs fly.
p87
aa(lp88
V(Laughter)
p89
aa(lp90
VWhile this is an incredible thing,
p91
aVthis untethered artistic freedom,
p92
aVit can create chaos.
p93
aVIt can create unbelievable worlds,
p94
aVunbelievable movement,
p95
aVthings that are jarring to the audience.
p96
aa(lp97
VSo to combat this, we tether ourselves with science.
p98
aVWe use science and the world we know
p99
aVas a backbone,
p100
aVto ground ourselves in something relatable and recognizable.
p101
aV"Finding Nemo" is an excellent example of this.
p102
aVA major portion of the movie takes place underwater.
p103
aVBut how do you make it look underwater?
p104
aa(lp105
VIn early research and development,
p106
aVwe took a clip of underwater footage and recreated it in the computer.
p107
aVThen we broke it back down
p108
aVto see which elements make up that underwater look.
p109
aVOne of the most critical elements
p110
aVwas how the light travels through the water.
p111
aVSo we coded up a light that mimics this physics \u2014
p112
aVfirst, the visibility of the water,
p113
aVand then what happens with the color.
p114
aVObjects close to the eye have their full, rich colors.
p115
aVAs light travels deeper into the water,
p116
aVwe lose the red wavelengths,
p117
aVthen the green wavelengths,
p118
aVleaving us with blue at the far depths.
p119
aa(lp120
VIn this clip you can see two other important elements.
p121
aVThe first is the surge and swell,
p122
aVor the invisible underwater current
p123
aVthat pushes the bits of particulate around in the water.
p124
aVThe second is the caustics.
p125
aVThese are the ribbons of light,
p126
aVlike you might see on the bottom of a pool,
p127
aVthat are created when the sun bends through the crests
p128
aVof the ripples and waves on the ocean's surface.
p129
aVHere we have the fog beams.
p130
aVThese give us color depth cues,
p131
aVbut also tells which direction is up
p132
aVin shots where we don't see the water surface.
p133
aVThe other really cool thing you can see here
p134
aVis that we lit that particulate only with the caustics,
p135
aVso that as it goes in and out of those ribbons of light,
p136
aVit appears and disappears,
p137
aVlending a subtle, magical sparkle to the underwater.
p138
aa(lp139
VYou can see how we're using the science \u2014
p140
aVthe physics of water, light and movement \u2014
p141
aVto tether that artistic freedom.
p142
aVBut we are not beholden to it.
p143
aVWe considered each of these elements
p144
aVand which ones had to be scientifically accurate
p145
aVand which ones we could push and pull to suit the story and the mood.
p146
aa(lp147
VWe realized early on that color was one we had some leeway with.
p148
aVSo here's a traditionally colored underwater scene.
p149
aVBut here, we can take Sydney Harbor and push it fairly green
p150
aVto suit the sad mood of what's happening.
p151
aVIn this scene, it's really important we see deep into the underwater,
p152
aVso we understand what the East Australian Current is,
p153
aVthat the turtles are diving into and going on this roller coaster ride.
p154
aVSo we pushed the visibility of the water
p155
aVwell past anything you would ever see in real life.
p156
aVBecause in the end,
p157
aVwe are not trying to recreate the scientifically correct real world,
p158
aVwe're trying to create a believable world,
p159
aVone the audience can immerse themselves in to experience the story.
p160
aa(lp161
VWe use science to create something wonderful.
p162
aVWe use story and artistic touch to get us to a place of wonder.
p163
aVThis guy, WALL-E, is a great example of that.
p164
aVHe finds beauty in the simplest things.
p165
aVBut when he came in to lighting, we knew we had a big problem.
p166
aVWe got so geeked-out on making WALL-E this convincing robot,
p167
aVthat we made his binoculars practically optically perfect.
p168
aa(lp169
V(Laughter)
p170
aa(lp171
VHis binoculars are one of the most critical acting devices he has.
p172
aVHe doesn't have a face or even traditional dialogue, for that matter.
p173
aVSo the animators were heavily dependent on the binoculars
p174
aVto sell his acting and emotions.
p175
aa(lp176
VWe started lighting and we realized
p177
aVthe triple lenses inside his binoculars were a mess of reflections.
p178
aVHe was starting to look glassy-eyed.
p179
aa(lp180
V(Laughter)
p181
aa(lp182
VNow, glassy-eyed is a fundamentally awful thing
p183
aVwhen you are trying to convince an audience
p184
aVthat a robot has a personality and he's capable of falling in love.
p185
aVSo we went to work on these optically perfect binoculars,
p186
aVtrying to find a solution that would maintain his true robot materials
p187
aVbut solve this reflection problem.
p188
aa(lp189
VSo we started with the lenses.
p190
aVHere's the flat-front lens,
p191
aVwe have a concave lens
p192
aVand a convex lens.
p193
aVAnd here you see all three together,
p194
aVshowing us all these reflections.
p195
aVWe tried turning them down,
p196
aVwe tried blocking them,
p197
aVnothing was working.
p198
aVYou can see here,
p199
aVsometimes we needed something specific reflected in his eyes \u2014
p200
aVusually Eve.
p201
aVSo we couldn't just use some faked abstract image on the lenses.
p202
aVSo here we have Eve on the first lens,
p203
aVwe put Eve on the second lens,
p204
aVit's not working.
p205
aVWe turn it down,
p206
aVit's still not working.
p207
aa(lp208
VAnd then we have our eureka moment.
p209
aVWe add a light to WALL-E that accidentally leaks into his eyes.
p210
aVYou can see it light up these gray aperture blades.
p211
aVSuddenly, those aperture blades are poking through that reflection
p212
aVthe way nothing else has.
p213
aVNow we recognize WALL-E as having an eye.
p214
aVAs humans we have the white of our eye,
p215
aVthe colored iris
p216
aVand the black pupil.
p217
aVNow WALL-E has the black of an eye,
p218
aVthe gray aperture blades
p219
aVand the black pupil.
p220
aVSuddenly, WALL-E feels like he has a soul,
p221
aVlike there's a character with emotion inside.
p222
aVLater in the movie towards the end,
p223
aVWALL-E loses his personality,
p224
aVessentially going dead.
p225
aVThis is the perfect time to bring back that glassy-eyed look.
p226
aVIn the next scene, WALL-E comes back to life.
p227
aVWe bring that light back to bring the aperture blades back,
p228
aVand he returns to that sweet, soulful robot we've come to love.
p229
aa(lp230
V(Video) WALL-E: Eva?
p231
aa(lp232
VDanielle Feinberg: There's a beauty in these unexpected moments \u2014
p233
aVwhen you find the key to unlocking a robot's soul,
p234
aVthe moment when you discover what you want to do with your life.
p235
aVThe jellyfish in "Finding Nemo" was one of those moments for me.
p236
aa(lp237
VThere are scenes in every movie that struggle to come together.
p238
aVThis was one of those scenes.
p239
aVThe director had a vision for this scene
p240
aVbased on some wonderful footage of jellyfish in the South Pacific.
p241
aVAs we went along,
p242
aVwe were floundering.
p243
aVThe reviews with the director
p244
aVturned from the normal look-and-feel conversation
p245
aVinto more and more questions about numbers and percentages.
p246
aVMaybe because unlike normal,
p247
aVwe were basing it on something in real life,
p248
aVor maybe just because we had lost our way.
p249
aVBut it had become about using our brain without our eyes,
p250
aVthe science without the art.
p251
aVThat scientific tether was strangling the scene.
p252
aa(lp253
VBut even through all the frustrations,
p254
aVI still believed it could be beautiful.
p255
aVSo when it came in to lighting,
p256
aVI dug in.
p257
aVAs I worked to balance the blues and the pinks,
p258
aVthe caustics dancing on the jellyfish bells,
p259
aVthe undulating fog beams,
p260
aVsomething promising began to appear.
p261
aVI came in one morning and checked the previous night's work.
p262
aVAnd I got excited.
p263
aVAnd then I showed it to the lighting director
p264
aVand she got excited.
p265
aVSoon, I was showing to the director in a dark room full of 50 people.
p266
aa(lp267
VIn director review,
p268
aVyou hope you might get some nice words,
p269
aVthen you get some notes and fixes, generally.
p270
aVAnd then, hopefully, you get a final,
p271
aVsignaling to move on to the next stage.
p272
aVI gave my intro, and I played the jellyfish scene.
p273
aVAnd the director was silent for an uncomfortably long amount of time.
p274
aVJust long enough for me to think,
p275
aV"Oh no, this is doomed."
p276
aVAnd then he started clapping.
p277
aVAnd then the production designer started clapping.
p278
aVAnd then the whole room was clapping.
p279
aVThis is the moment that I live for in lighting.
p280
aVThe moment where it all comes together
p281
aVand we get a world that we can believe in.
p282
aa(lp283
VWe use math, science and code to create these amazing worlds.
p284
aVWe use storytelling and art to bring them to life.
p285
aVIt's this interweaving of art and science
p286
aVthat elevates the world to a place of wonder,
p287
aVa place with soul,
p288
aVa place we can believe in,
p289
aVa place where the things you imagine can become real \u2014
p290
aVand a world where a girl suddenly realizes
p291
aVnot only is she a scientist,
p292
aVbut also an artist.
p293
