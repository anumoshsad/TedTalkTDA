VTwo months ago, my kids and I huddled around a cell phone
p4
aVwatching the live stream of the Game Awards,
p5
aVone of the video game industry's biggest nights.
p6
aVThey announced the nominees for the Game for Impact,
p7
aVan award that's given to a thought-provoking video game
p8
aVwith a profound prosocial message or meaning.
p9
aVThey opened the envelope
p10
aVand they read the title of our video game.
p11
aVAn award ...
p12
aVfor impact.
p13
aVIt was almost funny, actually,
p14
aVbecause I always thought that winning an award like that
p15
aVwould have this huge impact on my life,
p16
aVbut I found that the opposite is true.
p17
aa(lp18
VThe big nights,
p19
aVthe accomplishments \u2014
p20
aVthey fade.
p21
aVBut the hardest nights of my life have stuck with me,
p22
aVimpacting who I am
p23
aVand what I do.
p24
aa(lp25
VIn 2010, my third son, Joel, was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive brain tumor.
p26
aVAnd before that year was finished,
p27
aVdoctors sat my husband and I down
p28
aVand let us know that his tumor had returned
p29
aVdespite the most aggressive chemotherapy and radiation that they could offer him.
p30
aVOn that terrible night,
p31
aVafter learning that Joel had perhaps four months to live,
p32
aVI cuddled up with my two older sons in bed \u2014
p33
aVthey were five and three at the time \u2014
p34
aVand I never really knew how much they understood,
p35
aVso I started telling them a bedtime story.
p36
aVI told them about this very brave knight named Joel
p37
aVand his adventure fighting a terrible dragon called cancer.
p38
aVEvery night, I told them more of the story,
p39
aVbut I never let the story end.
p40
aVI was just building up a context that they could understand
p41
aVand hoping that our prayers would be answered
p42
aVand I would never have to tell them that that knight,
p43
aVwho had fought so bravely,
p44
aVwas done fighting
p45
aVand could rest now, forever.
p46
aa(lp47
VFortunately, I never did have to finish that bedtime story.
p48
aVMy children outgrew it.
p49
aVJoel responded better than anyone expected to palliative treatment,
p50
aVand so instead of months,
p51
aVwe spent years learning how to love our dying child with all of our hearts.
p52
aVLearning to recognize that shameful feeling
p53
aVof holding back just a little love
p54
aVto try to spare ourselves just a little pain
p55
aVsomewhere further down the road.
p56
aVWe pushed past that self-preservation
p57
aVbecause Joel was worth loving even if that love could crush us.
p58
aVAnd that lesson of intense vulnerability has changed me ...
p59
aVmore than any award ever could.
p60
aa(lp61
VWe started living like Joel could live,
p62
aVand we began developing a video game called "That Dragon, Cancer."
p63
aVIt was the story of Joel.
p64
aVIt was the story of hope in the shadow of death.
p65
aVIt was the story of faith
p66
aVand doubt,
p67
aVand the realization that a wrestle with doubt is a part of faith \u2014
p68
aVmaybe the biggest part of it.
p69
aVIt was a story that began as a miracle
p70
aVand ended as a memorial.

aa(lp96
VWhen you play "That Dragon, Cancer,"
p97
aVyou're transformed into a witness of Joel's life,
p98
aVexploring an emotional landscape,
p99
aVclicking to discover more of what we as a family felt and experienced.
p100
aVIt feels a little bit like analyzing interactive poetry
p101
aVbecause every game mechanic is a metaphor,
p102
aVand so the more the player asks themselves
p103
aVwhat we as designers were trying to express and why,
p104
aVthe richer the experience becomes.
p105
aa(lp106
VWe took that vulnerability that Joel taught us,
p107
aVand we encoded the game with it.
p108
aVPlayers expect their video games to offer them branching narrative
p109
aVso that every decision that they make feels important
p110
aVand can change the outcome of the game.
p111
aVWe subverted that principle of game design,
p112
aVcollapsing the choices in on the player
p113
aVso that they discover for themselves
p114
aVthat there is nothing that they can do that will change the outcome for Joel.
p115
aVAnd they feel that discovery as deeply and desperately as we felt it
p116
aVon nights when we held Joel in our arms praying for hours,
p117
aVstubbornly holding out hope for a grace that we could not create for ourselves.
p118
aa(lp119
VWe'd all prefer to win,
p120
aVbut when you discover that you can't win,
p121
aVwhat do you value instead?
p122
aa(lp123
VI never planned to write video games,
p124
aVbut these moments that really change our lives,
p125
aVthey often come as the result of our hardship \u2014 and not our glory.
p126
aVWhen we thought that Joel could live,
p127
aVI left the game designing to my husband.
p128
aVI chimed in here and there
p129
aVwith a scene or two and some suggestions.
p130
aVBut after the night that Joel died,
p131
aVthe passion,
p132
aVthe possibility of sharing Joel's life through our video game \u2014
p133
aVit was something that I couldn't resist.
p134
aVI started writing more,
p135
aVI sat in on our team's design meetings,
p136
aVI added more ideas and I helped direct scenes.
p137
aVAnd I discovered that creating a video game is telling a story,
p138
aVbut with an entirely new vocabulary.
p139
aVAll the same elements of imagination and symbolism are there,
p140
aVbut they're just partnered with player agency
p141
aVand system responsiveness.
p142
aVIt's challenging work.
p143
aVI have to think in a totally new way to do it,
p144
aVbut I love it.
p145
aVAnd I wouldn't have known that without Joel.
p146
aa(lp147
VMaybe you're a little surprised
p148
aVby our choice to share our story of terminal cancer through a video game.
p149
aVPerhaps you're even thinking like so many people before you:
p150
aVcancer is not a game.
p151
aVWell, tell that to any pediatric cancer parent
p152
aVthat's ever taken an exam glove and blown it up into a balloon,
p153
aVor transformed a syringe into a rocket ship,
p154
aVor let their child ride their IV pole through the hospital halls
p155
aVlike it was a race car.
p156
aVBecause when you have children,
p157
aVeverything is a game.
p158
aVAnd when your young child experiences something traumatic,
p159
aVyou work even harder to make sure that their life feels like a game
p160
aVbecause children naturally explore their worlds through play.
p161
aVWhile cancer can steal many things from a family,
p162
aVit shouldn't steal play.
p163
aa(lp164
VIf you're listening to me and you're trying to imagine this family
p165
aVthat revolves entirely around a dying child,
p166
aVand you can't imagine joy as part of that picture,
p167
aVthen we were right to share our story with you,
p168
aVbecause that season of our life was hard.
p169
aVUnspeakably hard at times,
p170
aVbut it was also pure hope,
p171
aVdeep love
p172
aVand joy like I have never experienced since.
p173
aVOur video game was our attempt to share that world
p174
aVwith people who hadn't experienced it before,
p175
aVbecause we never could imagine that world until it became ours.
p176
aa(lp177
VWe made a video game that's hard to play.
p178
aVIt will never be a blockbuster.
p179
aVPeople have to prepare themselves to invest emotionally
p180
aVin a story that they know will break their hearts.
p181
aVBut when our hearts break,
p182
aVthey heal a little differently.
p183
aVMy broken heart has been healing with a new and a deeper compassion \u2014
p184
aVa desire to sit with people in their pain,
p185
aVto hear their stories and try to help tell them
p186
aVso that they know that they're seen.
p187
aa(lp188
VOn the night when "That Dragon, Cancer" won the Game for Impact Award,
p189
aVwe cheered,
p190
aVwe smiled and we talked about Joel
p191
aVand the impact he had on our life \u2014
p192
aVon all of those hard and hopeful nights that we shared with him
p193
aVwhen he changed our hearts
p194
aVand taught us so much more about life and love and faith and purpose.
p195
aVThat award will never mean as much to me as even a single photograph of my son,
p196
aVbut it does represent all of the people who his life has impacted,
p197
aVpeople I'll never meet.
p198
aVThey write me emails sometimes.
p199
aVThey tell me that they miss Joel, even though they never met him.
p200
aVThey describe the tears that they've shed for my son,
p201
aVand it makes my burden of grief just a little bit lighter
p202
aVknowing that it's shared with a 10-year-old
p203
aVwatching a YouTube playthrough,
p204
aVor a doctor playing on his airplane with a smartphone,
p205
aVor a professor introducing Joel to her first-year philosophy students.
p206
aa(lp207
VWe made a video game that's hard to play.
p208
aVBut that feels just right to me,
p209
aVbecause the hardest moments of our lives
p210
aVchange us more than any goal we could ever accomplish.
p211
aVTragedy has shifted my heart
p212
aVmore than any dream I could ever see come true.
