VGood afternoon.
p4
aVI am not a farmer.
p5
aa(lp6
V(Laughter)
p7
aa(lp8
VI'm not. I'm a parent, I'm a resident and I'm a teacher.
p9
aVAnd this is my world.
p10
aVAnd along the way I've started noticing \u2014
p11
aVI'm on my third generation of kids \u2014
p12
aVthat they're getting bigger.
p13
aVThey're getting sicker.
p14
aVIn addition to these complexities,
p15
aVI just learned that 70 percent of the kids that I see
p16
aVwho are labeled learning disabled would not have been
p17
aVhad they had proper prenatal nutrition.
p18
aa(lp19
VThe realities of my community are simple. They look like this.
p20
aVKids should not have to grow up and look at things like this.
p21
aVAnd as jobs continue to leave my community,
p22
aVand energy continues to come in, be exported in,
p23
aVit's no wonder that really some people refer to the South Bronx as a desert.
p24
aVBut I'm the oldest sixth grader you'll ever meet,
p25
aVso I get up every day with this tremendous amount of enthusiasm
p26
aVthat I'm hoping to share with you all today.
p27
aVAnd with that note, I come to you with this belief
p28
aVthat kids should not have to leave their communities
p29
aVto live, learn and earn in a better one.
p30
aa(lp31
VSo I'm here to tell you a story about me
p32
aVand this wall that I met outside, which I'm now bringing inside.
p33
aVAnd it starts with three people.
p34
aVThe crazy teacher \u2014 that's me on the left,
p35
aVI dress up pretty, thank you, my wife, I love you for getting a good suit \u2014
p36
aVmy passionate borough president
p37
aVand a guy named George Irwin from Green Living Technologies
p38
aVwho helped me with my class
p39
aVand helped me get involved with this patented technology.
p40
aVBut it all starts with seeds in classrooms,
p41
aVin my place, which looks like this.
p42
aVAnd I'm here today hoping that my reach will exceed my grasp.
p43
aVAnd that's really what this is all about.
p44
aa(lp45
VAnd it starts with incredible kids like this,
p46
aVwho come early and stay late.
p47
aVAll of my kids are either IEP or ELL learners,
p48
aVmost come with a lot of handicaps,
p49
aVmost are homeless and many are in foster care.
p50
aVAlmost all of my kids live below poverty.
p51
aVBut with those seeds, from day one, we are growing in my classroom,
p52
aVand this is what it looks like in my classroom.
p53
aVAnd you see how attentive these kids are to these seeds.
p54
aVAnd then you notice that those seeds become farms across the Bronx that look like this.
p55
aa(lp56
VBut again, I am not a farmer. I'm a teacher.
p57
aVAnd I don't like weeding, and I don't like back-breaking labor.
p58
aVSo I wanted to figure out how I could get this kind of success
p59
aVinto something small, like this,
p60
aVand bring it into my classroom so that handicapped kids could do it,
p61
aVkids who didn't want to be outside could do it,
p62
aVand everyone could have access.
p63
aVSo I called George Irwin, and what do you know?
p64
aVHe came to my class and we built an indoor edible wall.
p65
aVAnd what we do is we partner it with authentic learning experiences,
p66
aVprivate-based learning.
p67
aVAnd lo and behold, we gave birth to
p68
aVthe first edible wall in New York City.
p69
aa(lp70
VSo if you're hungry, get up and eat.
p71
aVYou can do it right now. My kids play cow all the time.
p72
aVOkay? But we were just getting started,
p73
aVthe kids loved the technology,
p74
aVso we called up George and we said, "We gotta learn more!"
p75
aVNow, Mayor Bloomberg, thank you very much, we no longer need work permits,
p76
aVwhich comes with slices and bonded contractors \u2014 we're available for you \u2014
p77
aa(lp78
VWe decided to go to Boston.
p79
aVAnd my kids, from the poorest congressional district in America,
p80
aVbecame the first to install a green wall,
p81
aVdesigned by a computer, with real-live learning tools,
p82
aV21 stories up \u2014 if you're going to go visit it,
p83
aVit's on top of the John Hancock building.
p84
aVBut closer to home, we started installing these walls in schools
p85
aVthat look like this with lighting like that,
p86
aVreal LED stuff, 21st-century technology.
p87
aVAnd what do you know? We made 21st century money,
p88
aVand that was groundbreaking. Wow!
p89
aa(lp90
VThis is my harvest, people.
p91
aVAnd what do you do with this food? You cook it!
p92
aVAnd those are my heirloom students making heirloom sauce,
p93
aVwith plastic forks, and we get it into the cafeteria,
p94
aVand we grow stuff and we feed our teachers.
p95
aVAnd that is the youngest nationally certified
p96
aVworkforce in America with our Bronx Borough President.
p97
aa(lp98
VAnd what'd we do then? Well, I met nice people like you,
p99
aVand they invited us to the Hamptons.
p100
aVSo I call this "from South Bronx to Southampton."
p101
aVAnd we started putting in roofs that look like this,
p102
aVand we came in from destitute neighborhoods
p103
aVto start building landscape like this, wow! People noticed.
p104
aVAnd so we got invited back this past summer,
p105
aVand we actually moved into the Hamptons,
p106
aVpayed 3,500 dollars a week for a house, and we learned how to surf.
p107
aVAnd when you can do stuff like this \u2014
p108
aVThese are my kids putting in this technology,
p109
aVand when you can build a roof that looks like that
p110
aVon a house that looks like that
p111
aVwith sedum that looks like this,
p112
aVthis is the new green graffiti.
p113
aa(lp114
VSo, you may wonder what does a wall like this
p115
aVreally do for kids, besides changing landscapes and mindsets?
p116
aVOkay, I'm going to tell you what it does.
p117
aVIt gets me to meet incredible contractors like this,
p118
aVJim Ellenberger from Ellenberger Services.
p119
aVAnd this is where it becomes true triple bottom line.
p120
aVBecause Jim realized that these kids, my future farmers,
p121
aVreally had the skills he needed to build affordable housing
p122
aVfor New Yorkers, right in their own neighborhood.
p123
aVAnd this is what my kids are doing, making living wage.
p124
aa(lp125
VNow, if you're like me, you live in a building, there are seven guys
p126
aVout of work looking to manage a million dollars.
p127
aVI don't have it. But if you need a toilet fixed
p128
aVor, you know, some shelving, I gotta wait six months
p129
aVfor an appointment with someone who drives a much nicer car than me.
p130
aVThat's the beauty of this economy.
p131
aVBut my kids are now licensed and bonded in trade.
p132
aVAnd that's my first student to open up, the first in his family to have a bank account.
p133
aVThis immigrant student is the first one in his family to use an ATM.
p134
aVAnd this is the true triple bottom line,
p135
aVbecause we can take neighborhoods that were abandoned and destitute
p136
aVand turn them into something like this with interiors like this.
p137
aa(lp138
VWow! People noticed. And notice they did.
p139
aVSo CNN called, and we were delighted to have them come to our farmer's market.
p140
aVAnd then when Rockefeller Center said, NBC,
p141
aVcould you put this thing up on the walls? We were delighted.
p142
aVBut this, I show you, when kids from the poorest congressional district in America
p143
aVcan build a 30-foot by 15-foot wall,
p144
aVdesign it, plant it and install it in the heart of New York City,
p145
aVthat's a true "sí se puede" moment.
p146
aVReally scholastic, if you ask me.
p147
aa(lp148
VBut this is not a Getty image.
p149
aVThat's a picture I took of my Bronx Borough President,
p150
aVaddressing my kids in his house, not the jailhouse,
p151
aVmaking them feel a part of it.
p152
aVThat's our State Senator Gustavo Rivera and Bob Bieder,
p153
aVcoming to my classroom to make my kids feel important.
p154
aVAnd when the Bronx Borough President shows up
p155
aVand the State Senator comes to our class,
p156
aVbelieve you me, the Bronx can change attitudes now.
p157
aVWe are poised, ready, willing and able
p158
aVto export our talent and diversity in ways we've never even imagined.
p159
aVAnd when the local senator gets on the scale in public
p160
aVand says he's got to lose weight, so do I!
p161
aVAnd I tell you what, I'm doing it and so are the kids.
p162
aa(lp163
VOkay? And then celebrities started.
p164
aVProduce Pete can't believe what we grow.
p165
aVLorna Sass came and donated books.
p166
aVOkay? We're feeding seniors.
p167
aVAnd when we realized that we were growing for food justice in the South Bronx,
p168
aVso did the international community.
p169
aVAnd my kids in the South Bronx were repped in
p170
aVthe first international green roof conference.
p171
aVAnd that's just great.
p172
aa(lp173
VExcept what about locally?
p174
aVWell, we met this woman, Avis Richards, with the Ground Up Campaign.
p175
aVUnbelievable! Through her, my kids,
p176
aVthe most disenfranchised and marginalized,
p177
aVwere able to roll out 100 gardens to New York City public schools.
p178
aVThat's triple bottom line! Okay?
p179
aa(lp180
VA year ago today, I was invited to the New York Academy of Medicine.
p181
aVI thought this concept of designing a strong and healthy New York
p182
aVmade sense, especially when the resources were free.
p183
aVSo thank you all and I love them.
p184
aVThey introduced me to the New York City Strategic Alliance for Health,
p185
aVagain, free resources, don't waste them.
p186
aVAnd what do you know? Six months later,
p187
aVmy school and my kids were awarded the first ever
p188
aVhigh school award of excellence for creating a healthy school environment.
p189
aVThe greenest class in New York City.
p190
aVBut more importantly is my kids learned to get,
p191
aVthey learned to give.
p192
aVAnd we took the money that we made from our farmer's market,
p193
aVand started buying gifts for the homeless
p194
aVand for needy around the world.
p195
aVSo we started giving back.
p196
aVAnd that's when I realized that the greening of America
p197
aVstarts first with the pockets, then with the heart
p198
aVand then with the mind.
p199
aa(lp200
VSo we were onto something, and we're still onto something.
p201
aVAnd thank God Trinity Wall Street noticed,
p202
aVbecause they gave us the birth of Green Bronx Machine.
p203
aVWe're 3,000 strong right now.
p204
aVAnd what does it really do?
p205
aVIt teaches kids to re-vision their communities,
p206
aVso when they grow up in places like this, they can imagine it like this.
p207
aVAnd my kids, trained and certified \u2014
p208
aVMa, you get the tax abatement. Thank you, Mayor Bloomberg \u2014
p209
aVcan take communities that look like this and convert them into things that look like that,
p210
aVand that to me, people, is another true "sí se puede" moment.
p211
aa(lp212
VNow, how does it start? It starts in schools.
p213
aVNo more little Knicks and little Nets.
p214
aVGroup by broccoli, group by your favorite vegetable,
p215
aVsomething you can aspire to.
p216
aVOkay? And these are my future farmers of America,
p217
aVgrowing up in Brook Park on 141st Street,
p218
aVthe most migrant community in America.
p219
aVWhen tenacious little ones learn how to garden like this,
p220
aVit's no wonder we get fruit like that.
p221
aVAnd I love it! And so do they.
p222
aVAnd we're building teepees in neighborhoods that were burning down.
p223
aVAnd that's a true "sí se puede" moment.
p224
aVAnd again, Brook Park feeds hundreds of people
p225
aVwithout a food stamp or a fingerprint.
p226
aVThe poorest congressional district in America,
p227
aVthe most migratory community in America, we can do this.
p228
aVBissel Gardens is cranking out food in epic proportions,
p229
aVmoving kids into an economy they never imagined.
p230
aa(lp231
VNow, somewhere over the rainbow, my friends,
p232
aVis the South Bronx of America. And we're doing it.
p233
aVHow does it start? Well, look at Jose's attention to detail.
p234
aVThank God Omar knows that carrots come from the ground,
p235
aVand not aisle 9 at the supermarket
p236
aVor through a bullet-proof window or through a piece of styrofoam.
p237
aVAnd when Henry knows that green is good, so do I.
p238
aVAnd when you expand their palates, you expand their vocabulary.
p239
aVAnd most importantly, when you put big kids together with little kids,
p240
aVyou get the big fat white guy out of the middle, which is cool,
p241
aVand you create this kind of accountability amongst peers, which is incredible.
p242
aa(lp243
VGod, I'm going to run out of time, so I've gotta keep it moving.
p244
aVBut this is my weekly paycheck for kids; that's our green graffiti.
p245
aVThis is what we're doing.
p246
aVAnd behold the glory and bounty that is Bronx County.
p247
aVNothing thrills me more than to see kids pollinating plants instead of each other.
p248
aVI gotta tell you, I'm a protective parent.
p249
aVBut those kids are the kids who are now putting
p250
aVpumpkin patches on top of trains.
p251
aVWe're also designing coin ponds for the rich and affluent.
p252
aVWe're also becoming children of the corn,
p253
aVcreating farms in the middle of Fordham Road for awareness
p254
aVand window bottles out of garbage.
p255
aa(lp256
VNow I don't expect every kid to be a farmer,
p257
aVbut I expect you to read about it, write about it, blog about it, offer outstanding customer service.
p258
aVI expect them to be engaged, and man, are they!
p259
aVSo that's my incredible classroom, that's the food.
p260
aVWhere does it go? Zero miles to plate, right down into the cafeteria.
p261
aVOr more importantly, to local shelters,
p262
aVwhere most of our kids are getting one to two meals a day.
p263
aVAnd we're stepping it up.
p264
aVNo Air Jordans were ever ruined on my farm.
p265
aVAnd in his day, a million dollar gardens and incredible installations.
p266
aa(lp267
VLet me tell you something, people.
p268
aVThis is a beautiful moment.
p269
aVBlack field, brown field, toxic waste field, battlefield \u2014
p270
aVwe're proving in the Bronx that you can grow anywhere, on cement.
p271
aVAnd we take orders for flowers. I'm putting the bake sale to shame.
p272
aVWe take orders now. I'm booking for the spring.
p273
aVAnd these were all grown from seeds. We're learning everything.
p274
aVAnd again, when you can take kids from backgrounds as diverse
p275
aVas this to do something as special as this,
p276
aVwe're really creating a moment.
p277
aa(lp278
VNow, you may ask about these kids.
p279
aVForty percent attendance to 93 percent attendance.
p280
aVAll start overage and under-credit.
p281
aVThey are now, my first cohort is all in college, earning a living wage.
p282
aVThe rest are scheduled to graduate this June.
p283
aVHappy kids, happy families, happy colleagues.
p284
aVAmazed people. The glory and bounty that is Bronx County.
p285
aa(lp286
VLet's talk about mint. Where is my mint?
p287
aVI grow seven kinds of mint in my class.
p288
aVMojitos, anybody? I'll be at Telepan later.
p289
aVBut, understand this is my intellectual Viagra.
p290
aVLadies and gentlemen, I gotta move quick, but understand this:
p291
aVThe borough that gave us baggy pants and funky fresh beats
p292
aVis becoming home to the organic ones.
p293
aVMy green [unclear] 25,000 pounds of vegetables,
p294
aVI'm growing organic citizens, engaged kids.
p295
aVSo help us go from this to this.
p296
aVSelf-sustaining entities, 18 months return on investment,
p297
aVplus we're paying people living wage and health benefits,
p298
aVwhile feeding people for pennies on the dollar.
p299
aa(lp300
VMartin Luther King said that people need to be uplifted with dignity.
p301
aVSo here in New York, I urge you, my fellow Americans,
p302
aVto help us make America great again.
p303
aVIt's simple. Share your passion.
p304
aVIt's real easy. Go see these two videos, please.
p305
aVOne got us invited to the White House, one's a recent incarnation.
p306
aa(lp307
VAnd most importantly, get the biggest bully out of schools.
p308
aVThis has got to go tomorrow.
p309
aVPeople, you can all do that.
p310
aVKeep kids out of stores that look like this.
p311
aVMake them a healthy plate,
p312
aVespecially if you can pick it off the wall in your own classroom \u2014 delicioso!
p313
aVModel good behavior. Get them to a green cart.
p314
aVBig kids love strawberries and bananas.
p315
aVTeach them entrepreneurship. Thank God for GrowNYC.
p316
aVLet them cook. Great lunch today, let them do culinary things.
p317
aVBut most importantly, just love them.
p318
aVNothing works like unconditional love.
p319
aa(lp320
VSo, my good friend Kermit said it's not easy being green.
p321
aVIt's not. I come from a place where kids can buy
p322
aV35 flavors of blunt wrap at any day of the moment,
p323
aVwhere ice cream freezers are filled with slushy malt liquor.
p324
aVOkay? My dear friend Majora Carter once told me,
p325
aVwe have everything to gain and nothing to lose.
p326
aVSo here, and at a time when we've gone from
p327
aVthe audacity to hope to hope for some audacity,
p328
aVI urge you to do something.
p329
aVI urge you to do something.
p330
aa(lp331
VRight now, we're all tadpoles,
p332
aVbut I urge you to become a big frog and take that big, green leap.
p333
aVI don't care if you're on the left, on the right, up the middle, wherever.
p334
aVJoin me. Use \u2014 I've got a lot of energy. Help me use it.
p335
aVWe can do something here.
p336
aVAnd along the way, please take time to smell the flowers,
p337
aVespecially if you and your students grew them.
p338
aa(lp339
VI'm Steve Ritz, this is Green Bronx Machine.
p340
aVI've got to say thank you to my wife and family, for my kids,
p341
aVthank you for coming every day, and for my colleagues,
p342
aVbelieving and supporting me.
p343
aVWe are growing our way into a new economy.
p344
aVThank you, God bless you and enjoy the day. I'm Steve Ritz.
p345
aa(lp346
VSí se puede!
