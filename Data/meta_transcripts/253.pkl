VThis is the Large Hadron Collider.
p4
aVIt's 27 kilometers in circumference.
p5
aVIt's the biggest scientific experiment ever attempted.
p6
aVOver 10,000 physicists and engineers
p7
aVfrom 85 countries around the world
p8
aVhave come together over several decades
p9
aVto build this machine.
p10
aVWhat we do is we accelerate protons \u2014
p11
aVso, hydrogen nuclei \u2014
p12
aVaround 99.999999
p13
aVpercent the speed of light.
p14
aVRight? At that speed, they go around
p15
aVthat 27 kilometers 11,000 times a second.
p16
aVAnd we collide them with another beam of protons
p17
aVgoing in the opposite direction.
p18
aVWe collide them inside giant detectors.
p19
aa(lp20
VThey're essentially digital cameras.
p21
aVAnd this is the one that I work on, ATLAS.
p22
aVYou get some sense of the size \u2014
p23
aVyou can just see these EU standard-size
p24
aVpeople underneath.
p25
aa(lp26
V(Laughter)
p27
aa(lp28
VYou get some sense of the size: 44 meters wide,
p29
aV22 meters in diameter, 7,000 tons.
p30
aVAnd we re-create the conditions that were present
p31
aVless than a billionth of a second after the universe began
p32
aVup to 600 million times a second
p33
aVinside that detector \u2014 immense numbers.
p34
aVAnd if you see those metal bits there \u2014
p35
aVthose are huge magnets that bend
p36
aVelectrically charged particles,
p37
aVso it can measure how fast they're traveling.
p38
aVThis is a picture about a year ago.
p39
aVThose magnets are in there.
p40
aVAnd, again, a EU standard-size, real person,
p41
aVso you get some sense of the scale.
p42
aVAnd it's in there that those mini-Big Bangs will be created,
p43
aVsometime in the summer this year.
p44
aa(lp45
VAnd actually, this morning, I got an email
p46
aVsaying that we've just finished, today,
p47
aVbuilding the last piece of ATLAS.
p48
aVSo as of today, it's finished. I'd like to say
p49
aVthat I planned that for TED,
p50
aVbut I didn't. So it's been completed as of today.
p51
aa(lp52
V(Applause)
p53
aa(lp54
VYeah, it's a wonderful achievement.
p55
aVSo, you might be asking, "Why?
p56
aVWhy create the conditions that were present
p57
aVless than a billionth of a second after the universe began?"
p58
aVWell, particle physicists are nothing if not ambitious.
p59
aVAnd the aim of particle physics is to understand
p60
aVwhat everything's made of, and how everything sticks together.
p61
aVAnd by everything I mean, of course,
p62
aVme and you, the Earth, the Sun,
p63
aVthe 100 billion suns in our galaxy
p64
aVand the 100 billion galaxies
p65
aVin the observable universe.
p66
aVAbsolutely everything.
p67
aa(lp68
VNow you might say, "Well, OK, but why not just look at it?
p69
aVYou know? If you want to know what I'm made of, let's look at me."
p70
aVWell, we found that as you look back in time,
p71
aVthe universe gets hotter and hotter,
p72
aVdenser and denser, and simpler and simpler.
p73
aVNow, there's no real reason I'm aware of for that,
p74
aVbut that seems to be the case.
p75
aVSo, way back in the early times of the universe,
p76
aVwe believe it was very simple and understandable.
p77
aVAll this complexity, all the way to these wonderful things \u2014
p78
aVhuman brains \u2014 are a property of an old
p79
aVand cold and complicated universe.
p80
aVBack at the start, in the first billionth of a second,
p81
aVwe believe, or we've observed, it was very simple.
p82
aa(lp83
VIt's almost like ...
p84
aVimagine a snowflake in your hand,
p85
aVand you look at it, and it's an incredibly complicated,
p86
aVbeautiful object. But as you heat it up,
p87
aVit'll melt into a pool of water,
p88
aVand you would be able to see that, actually, it was just made
p89
aVof H20, water.
p90
aVSo it's in that same sense that we look back in time
p91
aVto understand what the universe is made of.
p92
aVAnd, as of today, it's made of these things.
p93
aVJust 12 particles of matter,
p94
aVstuck together by four forces of nature.
p95
aVThe quarks, these pink things, are the things that make up protons and neutrons
p96
aVthat make up the atomic nuclei in your body.
p97
aVThe electron \u2014 the thing that goes around
p98
aVthe atomic nucleus \u2014
p99
aVheld around in orbit, by the way, by the electromagnetic force
p100
aVthat's carried by this thing, the photon.
p101
aVThe quarks are stuck together by other things called gluons.
p102
aa(lp103
VAnd these guys, here, they're the weak nuclear force,
p104
aVprobably the least familiar.
p105
aVBut, without it, the sun wouldn't shine.
p106
aVAnd when the sun shines, you get copious quantities
p107
aVof these things, called neutrinos, pouring out.
p108
aVActually, if you just look at your thumbnail \u2014
p109
aVabout a square centimeter \u2014
p110
aVthere are something like 60 billion neutrinos per second
p111
aVfrom the sun, passing
p112
aVthrough every square centimeter of your body.
p113
aVBut you don't feel them, because the weak force
p114
aVis correctly named \u2014
p115
aVvery short range and very weak,
p116
aVso they just fly through you.
p117
aa(lp118
VAnd these particles have been discovered
p119
aVover the last century, pretty much.
p120
aVThe first one, the electron, was discovered in 1897,
p121
aVand the last one, this thing called the tau neutrino,
p122
aVin the year 2000. Actually just \u2014
p123
aVI was going to say, just up the road in Chicago. I know it's a big country,
p124
aVAmerica, isn't it?
p125
aVJust up the road.
p126
aVRelative to the universe, it's just up the road.
p127
aa(lp128
V(Laughter)
p129
aa(lp130
VSo, this thing was discovered in the year 2000,
p131
aVso it's a relatively recent picture.
p132
aVOne of the wonderful things, actually, I find,
p133
aVis that we've discovered any of them, when you realize how tiny they are.
p134
aVYou know, they're a step in size
p135
aVfrom the entire observable universe.
p136
aVSo, 100 billion galaxies,
p137
aV13.7 billion light years away \u2014
p138
aVa step in size from that to Monterey, actually,
p139
aVis about the same as from Monterey to these things.
p140
aVAbsolutely, exquisitely minute,
p141
aVand yet we've discovered pretty much the full set.
p142
aa(lp143
VSo, one of my most illustrious forebears
p144
aVat Manchester University, Ernest Rutherford,
p145
aVdiscoverer of the atomic nucleus,
p146
aVonce said, "All science is either physics
p147
aVor stamp collecting."
p148
aVNow, I don't think he meant to insult
p149
aVthe rest of science,
p150
aValthough he was from New Zealand, so it's possible.
p151
aa(lp152
V(Laughter)
p153
aa(lp154
VBut what he meant was that what we've done, really,
p155
aVis stamp collect there.
p156
aVOK, we've discovered the particles,
p157
aVbut unless you understand the underlying
p158
aVreason for that pattern \u2014 you know, why it's built the way it is \u2014
p159
aVreally you've done stamp collecting. You haven't done science.
p160
aVFortunately, we have
p161
aVprobably one of the greatest scientific achievements of the twentieth century
p162
aVthat underpins that pattern.
p163
aVIt's the Newton's laws, if you want,
p164
aVof particle physics.
p165
aVIt's called the standard model \u2014 beautifully simple mathematical equation.
p166
aVYou could stick it on the front of a T-shirt,
p167
aVwhich is always the sign of elegance.
p168
aVThis is it.
p169
aa(lp170
V(Laughter)
p171
aa(lp172
VI've been a little disingenuous, because I've expanded it out
p173
aVin all its gory detail.
p174
aVThis equation, though, allows you to calculate everything \u2014
p175
aVother than gravity \u2014 that happens in the universe.
p176
aVSo, you want to know why the sky is blue, why atomic nuclei stick together \u2014
p177
aVin principle, you've got a big enough computer \u2014
p178
aVwhy DNA is the shape it is.
p179
aVIn principle, you should be able to calculate it from that equation.
p180
aa(lp181
VBut there's a problem.
p182
aVCan anyone see what it is?
p183
aVA bottle of champagne for anyone that tells me.
p184
aVI'll make it easier, actually, by blowing one of the lines up.
p185
aVBasically, each of these terms
p186
aVrefers to some of the particles.
p187
aVSo those Ws there refer to the Ws, and how they stick together.
p188
aVThese carriers of the weak force, the Zs, the same.
p189
aVBut there's an extra symbol in this equation: H.
p190
aVRight, H.
p191
aVH stands for Higgs particle.
p192
aVHiggs particles have not been discovered.
p193
aVBut they're necessary: they're necessary
p194
aVto make that mathematics work.
p195
aVSo all the exquisitely detailed calculations we can do
p196
aVwith that wonderful equation
p197
aVwouldn't be possible without an extra bit.
p198
aVSo it's a prediction:
p199
aVa prediction of a new particle.
p200
aa(lp201
VWhat does it do?
p202
aVWell, we had a long time to come up with good analogies.
p203
aVAnd back in the 1980s, when we wanted the money
p204
aVfor the LHC from the U.K. government,
p205
aVMargaret Thatcher, at the time, said,
p206
aV"If you guys can explain, in language
p207
aVa politician can understand,
p208
aVwhat the hell it is that you're doing, you can have the money.
p209
aVI want to know what this Higgs particle does."
p210
aVAnd we came up with this analogy, and it seemed to work.
p211
aVWell, what the Higgs does is, it gives mass to the fundamental particles.
p212
aVAnd the picture is that the whole universe \u2014
p213
aVand that doesn't mean just space, it means me as well, and inside you \u2014
p214
aVthe whole universe is full of something called a Higgs field.
p215
aVHiggs particles, if you will.
p216
aa(lp217
VThe analogy is that these people in a room
p218
aVare the Higgs particles.
p219
aVNow when a particle moves through the universe,
p220
aVit can interact with these Higgs particles.
p221
aVBut imagine someone who's not very popular moves through the room.
p222
aVThen everyone ignores them. They can just pass through the room very quickly,
p223
aVessentially at the speed of light. They're massless.
p224
aVAnd imagine someone incredibly important
p225
aVand popular and intelligent
p226
aVwalks into the room.
p227
aVThey're surrounded by people, and their passage through the room is impeded.
p228
aVIt's almost like they get heavy. They get massive.
p229
aVAnd that's exactly the way the Higgs mechanism works.
p230
aVThe picture is that the electrons and the quarks
p231
aVin your body and in the universe that we see around us
p232
aVare heavy, in a sense, and massive,
p233
aVbecause they're surrounded by Higgs particles.
p234
aVThey're interacting with the Higgs field.
p235
aa(lp236
VIf that picture's true,
p237
aVthen we have to discover those Higgs particles at the LHC.
p238
aVIf it's not true \u2014 because it's quite a convoluted mechanism,
p239
aValthough it's the simplest we've been able to think of \u2014
p240
aVthen whatever does the job of the Higgs particles
p241
aVwe know have to turn up
p242
aVat the LHC.
p243
aVSo, that's one of the prime reasons we built this giant machine.
p244
aVI'm glad you recognize Margaret Thatcher.
p245
aVActually, I thought about making it more culturally relevant, but \u2014
p246
aV(Laughter)
p247
aVanyway.
p248
aVSo that's one thing.
p249
aVThat's essentially a guarantee of what the LHC will find.
p250
aa(lp251
VThere are many other things. You've heard
p252
aVmany of the big problems in particle physics.
p253
aVOne of them you heard about: dark matter, dark energy.
p254
aVThere's another issue,
p255
aVwhich is that the forces in nature \u2014 it's quite beautiful, actually \u2014
p256
aVseem, as you go back in time,
p257
aVthey seem to change in strength.
p258
aVWell, they do change in strength.
p259
aVSo, the electromagnetic force, the force that holds us together,
p260
aVgets stronger as you go to higher temperatures.
p261
aVThe strong force, the strong nuclear force, which sticks nuclei together,
p262
aVgets weaker. And what you see is the standard model \u2014
p263
aVyou can calculate how these change \u2014 is the forces,
p264
aVthe three forces, other than gravity,
p265
aValmost seem to come together at one point.
p266
aVIt's almost as if there was one beautiful
p267
aVkind of super-force, back at the beginning of time.
p268
aVBut they just miss.
p269
aa(lp270
VNow there's a theory called super-symmetry,
p271
aVwhich doubles the number of particles in the standard model,
p272
aVwhich, at first sight, doesn't sound like a simplification.
p273
aVBut actually, with this theory,
p274
aVwe find that the forces of nature
p275
aVdo seem to unify together, back at the Big Bang \u2014
p276
aVabsolutely beautiful prophecy. The model wasn't built to do that,
p277
aVbut it seems to do it.
p278
aVAlso, those super-symmetric particles
p279
aVare very strong candidates for the dark matter.
p280
aVSo a very compelling theory
p281
aVthat's really mainstream physics.
p282
aVAnd if I was to put money on it, I would put money on \u2014
p283
aVin a very unscientific way \u2014 that
p284
aVthat these things would also crop up at the LHC.
p285
aVMany other things that the LHC could discover.
p286
aa(lp287
VBut in the last few minutes, I just want to give you
p288
aVa different perspective
p289
aVof what I think \u2014 what particle physics
p290
aVreally means to me \u2014 particle physics and cosmology.
p291
aVAnd that's that I think it's given us a wonderful
p292
aVnarrative \u2014 almost a creation story,
p293
aVif you'd like \u2014 about the universe,
p294
aVfrom modern science over the last few decades.
p295
aVAnd I'd say that it deserves,
p296
aVin the spirit of Wade Davis' talk,
p297
aVto be at least put up there with these wonderful creation stories
p298
aVof the peoples of the high Andes and the frozen north.
p299
aVThis is a creation story, I think, equally as wonderful.
p300
aa(lp301
VThe story goes like this: we know that
p302
aVthe universe began 13.7 billion years ago,
p303
aVin an immensely hot, dense state,
p304
aVmuch smaller than a single atom.
p305
aVIt began to expand about
p306
aVa million, billion, billion, billion billionth
p307
aVof a second \u2014 I think I got that right \u2014 after the Big Bang.
p308
aVGravity separated away from the other forces.
p309
aVThe universe then underwent
p310
aVan exponential expansion called inflation.
p311
aVIn about the first billionth of a second or so,
p312
aVthe Higgs field kicked in, and the quarks
p313
aVand the gluons and the electrons
p314
aVthat make us up got mass.
p315
aVThe universe continued to expand and cool.
p316
aVAfter about a few minutes,
p317
aVthere was hydrogen and helium in the universe. That's all.
p318
aVThe universe was about 75 percent hydrogen,
p319
aV25 percent helium. It still is today.
p320
aa(lp321
VIt continued to expand
p322
aVabout 300 million years.
p323
aVThen light began to travel through the universe.
p324
aVIt was big enough to be transparent to light,
p325
aVand that's what we see in the cosmic microwave background
p326
aVthat George Smoot described
p327
aVas looking at the face of God.
p328
aVAfter about 400 million years, the first stars formed,
p329
aVand that hydrogen, that helium, then began to cook
p330
aVinto the heavier elements.
p331
aVSo the elements of life \u2014
p332
aVcarbon, and oxygen and iron,
p333
aVall the elements that we need to make us up \u2014
p334
aVwere cooked in those first generations of stars,
p335
aVwhich then ran out of fuel, exploded,
p336
aVthrew those elements back into the universe.
p337
aVThey then re-collapsed into another generation
p338
aVof stars and planets.
p339
aa(lp340
VAnd on some of those planets, the oxygen, which had been created
p341
aVin that first generation of stars, could fuse with hydrogen
p342
aVto form water, liquid water on the surface.
p343
aVOn at least one, and maybe only one of those planets,
p344
aVprimitive life evolved,
p345
aVwhich evolved over millions of years into
p346
aVthings that walked upright and left footprints
p347
aVabout three and a half million years ago in the mud flats of Tanzania,
p348
aVand eventually
p349
aVleft a footprint on another world.
p350
aVAnd built this civilization,
p351
aVthis wonderful picture,
p352
aVthat turned the darkness into light,
p353
aVand you can see the civilization from space.
p354
aVAs one of my great heroes, Carl Sagan, said,
p355
aVthese are the things \u2014 and actually, not only these,
p356
aVbut I was looking around \u2014 these are the things,
p357
aVlike Saturn V rockets, and Sputnik,
p358
aVand DNA, and literature and science \u2014
p359
aVthese are the things that hydrogen atoms do
p360
aVwhen given 13.7 billion years.
p361
aa(lp362
VAbsolutely remarkable.
p363
aVAnd, the laws of physics. Right?
p364
aVSo, the right laws of physics \u2014
p365
aVthey're beautifully balanced.
p366
aVIf the weak force had been a little bit different,
p367
aVthen carbon and oxygen wouldn't be stable
p368
aVinside the hearts of stars,
p369
aVand there would be none of that in the universe.
p370
aVAnd I think that's
p371
aVa wonderful and significant story.
p372
aV50 years ago, I couldn't have told that story,
p373
aVbecause we didn't know it.
p374
aVIt makes me really feel that
p375
aVthat civilization \u2014
p376
aVwhich, as I say, if you believe
p377
aVthe scientific creation story,
p378
aVhas emerged purely as a result of the laws of physics,
p379
aVand a few hydrogen atoms \u2014
p380
aVthen I think, to me anyway,
p381
aVit makes me feel incredibly valuable.
p382
aa(lp383
VSo that's the LHC.
p384
aVThe LHC is certainly, when it turns on in summer,
p385
aVgoing to write the next chapter of that book.
p386
aVAnd I'm certainly looking forward with
p387
aVimmense excitement to it being turned on.
p388
aVThanks.
