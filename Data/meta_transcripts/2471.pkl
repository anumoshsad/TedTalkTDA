VSo there are lands few and far between on Earth itself
p4
aVthat are hospitable to humans by any measure,
p5
aVbut survive we have.
p6
aVOur primitive ancestors, when they found their homes and livelihood endangered,
p7
aVthey dared to make their way into unfamiliar territories
p8
aVin search of better opportunities.
p9
aVAnd as the descendants of these explorers,
p10
aVwe have their nomadic blood coursing through our own veins.
p11
aVBut at the same time,
p12
aVdistracted by our bread and circuses
p13
aVand embroiled in the wars that we have waged on each other,
p14
aVit seems that we have forgotten this desire to explore.
p15
aVWe, as a species, we're evolved uniquely
p16
aVfor Earth, on Earth, and by Earth,
p17
aVand so content are we with our living conditions
p18
aVthat we have grown complacent and just too busy
p19
aVto notice that its resources are finite,
p20
aVand that our Sun's life is also finite.
p21
aVWhile Mars and all the movies made in its name
p22
aVhave reinvigorated the ethos for space travel,
p23
aVfew of us seem to truly realize that our species' fragile constitution
p24
aVis woefully unprepared for long duration journeys into space.
p25
aa(lp26
VLet us take a trek to your local national forest
p27
aVfor a quick reality check.
p28
aVSo just a quick show of hands here:
p29
aVhow many of you think you would be able to survive in this lush wilderness
p30
aVfor a few days?
p31
aVWell, that's a lot of you.
p32
aVHow about a few weeks?
p33
aVThat's a decent amount.
p34
aVHow about a few months?
p35
aVThat's pretty good too.
p36
aVNow, let us imagine that this local national forest
p37
aVexperiences an eternal winter.
p38
aVSame questions: how many of you think you would be able to survive for a few days?
p39
aVThat's quite a lot.
p40
aVHow about a few weeks?
p41
aVSo for a fun twist, let us imagine that the only source of water available
p42
aVis trapped as frozen blocks miles below the surface.
p43
aVSoil nutrients are so minimal that no vegetation can be found,
p44
aVand of course hardly any atmosphere exists to speak of.
p45
aa(lp46
VSuch examples are only a few of the many challenges we would face
p47
aVon a planet like Mars.
p48
aVSo how do we steel ourselves for voyages whose destinations are so far removed
p49
aVfrom a tropical vacation?
p50
aVWill we continuously ship supplies from Planet Earth?
p51
aVBuild space elevators, or impossible miles of transport belts
p52
aVthat tether your planet of choice to our home planet?
p53
aVAnd how do we grow things like food that grew up on Earth like us?
p54
aa(lp55
VBut I'm getting ahead of myself.
p56
aVIn our species' journey to find a new home under a new sun,
p57
aVwe are more likely than not going to be spending much time
p58
aVin the journey itself,
p59
aVin space,
p60
aVon a ship, a hermetic flying can,
p61
aVpossibly for many generations.
p62
aa(lp63
VThe longest continuous amount of time that any human has spent in space
p64
aVis in the vicinity of 12 to 14 months.
p65
aVFrom astronauts' experiences in space,
p66
aVwe know that spending time in a microgravity environment
p67
aVmeans bone loss, muscle atrophy, cardiovascular problems,
p68
aVamong many other complications
p69
aVthat range for the physiological to the psychological.
p70
aVAnd what about macrogravity,
p71
aVor any other variation in gravitational pull
p72
aVof the planet that we find ourselves on?
p73
aa(lp74
VIn short, our cosmic voyages will be fraught with dangers
p75
aVboth known and unknown.
p76
aVSo far we've been looking to this new piece of mechanical technology
p77
aVor that great next generation robot
p78
aVas part of a lineup to ensure our species safe passage in space.
p79
aVWonderful as they are, I believe the time has come
p80
aVfor us to complement these bulky electronic giants
p81
aVwith what nature has already invented:
p82
aVthe microbe,
p83
aVa single-celled organism that is itself a self-generating, self-replenishing,
p84
aVliving machine.
p85
aVIt requires fairly little to maintain,
p86
aVoffers much flexibility in design
p87
aVand only asks to be carried in a single plastic tube.
p88
aa(lp89
VThe field of study that has enabled us to utilize the capabilities of the microbe
p90
aVis known as synthetic biology.
p91
aVIt comes from molecular biology, which has given us antibiotics, vaccines
p92
aVand better ways to observe the physiological nuances
p93
aVof the human body.
p94
aVUsing the tools of synthetic biology,
p95
aVwe can now edit the genes of nearly any organism,
p96
aVmicroscopic or not,
p97
aVwith incredible speed and fidelity.
p98
aVGiven the limitations of our man-made machines,
p99
aVsynthetic biology will be a means for us to engineer not only our food,
p100
aVour fuel and our environment,
p101
aVbut also ourselves
p102
aVto compensate for our physical inadequacies
p103
aVand to ensure our survival in space.
p104
aa(lp105
VTo give you an example
p106
aVof how we can use synthetic biology for space exploration,
p107
aVlet us return to the Mars environment.
p108
aVThe Martian soil composition is similar to that of Hawaiian volcanic ash,
p109
aVwith trace amounts of organic material.
p110
aVLet's say, hypothetically,
p111
aVwhat if martian soil could actually support plant growth
p112
aVwithout using Earth-derived nutrients?
p113
aVThe first question we should probably ask is,
p114
aVhow would we make our plants cold-tolerant?
p115
aVBecause, on average, the temperature on Mars
p116
aVis a very uninviting negative 60 degrees centigrade.
p117
aVThe next question we should ask is,
p118
aVhow do we make our plants drought-tolerant?
p119
aVConsidering that most of the water that forms as frost
p120
aVevaporates more quickly than I can say the word "evaporate."
p121
aVWell, it turns out we've already done things like this.
p122
aVBy borrowing genes for anti-freeze protein from fish
p123
aVand genes for drought tolerance from other plants like rice
p124
aVand then stitching them into the plants that need them,
p125
aVwe now have plants that can tolerate most droughts and freezes.
p126
aVThey're known on Earth as GMOs,
p127
aVor genetically modified organisms,
p128
aVand we rely on them to feed all the mouths of human civilization.
p129
aVNature does stuff like this already,
p130
aVwithout our help.
p131
aVWe have simply found more precise ways to do it.
p132
aa(lp133
VSo why would we want to change the genetic makeup of plants for space?
p134
aVWell, to not do so would mean needing to engineer
p135
aVendless acres of land on an entirely new planet
p136
aVby releasing trillions of gallons of atmospheric gasses
p137
aVand then constructing a giant glass dome to contain it all.
p138
aVIt's an unrealistic engineering enterprise
p139
aVthat quickly becomes a high-cost cargo transport mission.
p140
aVOne of the best ways to ensure
p141
aVthat we will have the food supplies and the air that we need
p142
aVis to bring with us organisms that have been engineered
p143
aVto adapt to new and harsh environments.
p144
aVIn essence, using engineered organisms to help us terraform a planet
p145
aVboth in the short and long term.
p146
aVThese organisms can then also be engineered to make medicine or fuel.
p147
aa(lp148
VSo we can use synthetic biology to bring highly engineered plants with us,
p149
aVbut what else can we do?
p150
aVWell, I mentioned earlier that we, as a species,
p151
aVwere evolved uniquely for planet Earth.
p152
aVThat fact has not changed much in the last five minutes
p153
aVthat you were sitting here and I was standing there.
p154
aVAnd so, if we were to dump any of us on Mars right this minute,
p155
aVeven given ample food, water, air
p156
aVand a suit,
p157
aVwe are likely to experience very unpleasant health problems
p158
aVfrom the amount of ionizing radiation that bombards the surface
p159
aVof planets like Mars that have little or nonexistent atmosphere.
p160
aVUnless we plan to stay holed up underground
p161
aVfor the duration of our stay on every new planet,
p162
aVwe must find better ways of protecting ourselves
p163
aVwithout needing to resort to wearing a suit of armor
p164
aVthat weighs something equal to your own body weight,
p165
aVor needing to hide behind a wall of lead.
p166
aa(lp167
VSo let us appeal to nature for inspiration.
p168
aVAmong the plethora of life here on Earth,
p169
aVthere's a subset of organisms known as extremophiles,
p170
aVor lovers of extreme living conditions,
p171
aVif you'll remember from high school biology.
p172
aVAnd among these organisms is a bacterium by the name of Deinococcus radiodurans.
p173
aVIt is known to be able to withstand cold, dehydration, vacuum, acid,
p174
aVand, most notably, radiation.
p175
aVWhile its radiation tolerance mechanisms are known,
p176
aVwe have yet to adapt the relevant genes to mammals.
p177
aVTo do so is not particularly easy.
p178
aVThere are many facets that go into its radiation tolerance,
p179
aVand it's not as simple as transferring one gene.
p180
aVBut given a little bit of human ingenuity
p181
aVand a little bit of time,
p182
aVI think to do so is not very hard either.
p183
aVEven if we borrow just a fraction of its ability to tolerate radiation,
p184
aVit would be infinitely better than what we already have,
p185
aVwhich is just the melanin in our skin.
p186
aVUsing the tools of synthetic biology,
p187
aVwe can harness Deinococcus radiodurans' ability
p188
aVto thrive under otherwise very lethal doses of radiation.
p189
aVAs difficult as it is to see,
p190
aVhomo sapiens, that is humans,
p191
aVevolves every day,
p192
aVand still continues to evolve.
p193
aVThousands of years of human evolution
p194
aVhas not only given us humans like Tibetans,
p195
aVwho can thrive in low-oxygen conditions,
p196
aVbut also Argentinians, who can ingest and metabolize arsenic,
p197
aVthe chemical element that can kill the average human being.
p198
aVEvery day, the human body evolves by accidental mutations
p199
aVthat equally accidentally allow certain humans
p200
aVto persevere in dismal situations.
p201
aa(lp202
VBut, and this is a big but,
p203
aVsuch evolution requires two things that we may not always have,
p204
aVor be able to afford,
p205
aVand they are death and time.
p206
aVIn our species' struggle to find our place in the universe,
p207
aVwe may not always have the time necessary
p208
aVfor the natural evolution of extra functions
p209
aVfor survival on non-Earth planets.
p210
aVWe're living in what E.O. Wilson has termed the age of gene circumvention,
p211
aVduring which we remedy our genetic defects like cystic fibrosis or muscular dystrophy
p212
aVwith temporary external supplements.
p213
aVBut with every passing day,
p214
aVwe approach the age of volitional evolution,
p215
aVa time during which we as a species
p216
aVwill have the capacity to decide for ourselves our own genetic destiny.
p217
aVAugmenting the human body with new abilities
p218
aVis no longer a question of how,
p219
aVbut of when.
p220
aa(lp221
VUsing synthetic biology
p222
aVto change the genetic makeup of any living organisms,
p223
aVespecially our own,
p224
aVis not without its moral and ethical quandaries.
p225
aVWill engineering ourselves make us less human?
p226
aVBut then again, what is humanity
p227
aVbut star stuff that happens to be conscious?
p228
aVWhere should human genius direct itself?
p229
aVSurely it is a bit of a waste to sit back and marvel at it.
p230
aVHow do we use our knowledge
p231
aVto protect ourselves from the external dangers
p232
aVand then protect ourselves from ourselves?
p233
aa(lp234
VI pose these questions
p235
aVnot to engender the fear of science
p236
aVbut to bring to light the many possibilities
p237
aVthat science has afforded and continues to afford us.
p238
aVWe must coalesce as humans to discuss and embrace the solutions
p239
aVnot only with caution
p240
aVbut also with courage.
p241
aa(lp242
VMars is a destination,
p243
aVbut it will not be our last.
p244
aVOur true final frontier is the line we must cross
p245
aVin deciding what we can and should make of our species' improbable intelligence.
p246
aa(lp247
VSpace is cold, brutal and unforgiving.
p248
aVOur path to the stars will be rife with trials
p249
aVthat will bring us to question not only who we are
p250
aVbut where we will be going.
p251
aVThe answers will lie in our choice to use or abandon the technology
p252
aVthat we have gleaned from life itself,
p253
aVand it will define us for the remainder of our term in this universe.
