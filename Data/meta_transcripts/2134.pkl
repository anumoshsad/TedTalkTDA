VOn January 4, 1934,
p4
aVa young man delivered a report
p5
aVto the United States Congress
p6
aVthat 80 years on,
p7
aVstill shapes the lives of everyone in this room today,
p8
aVstill shapes the lives of everyone on this planet.
p9
aVThat young man wasn't a politician,
p10
aVhe wasn't a businessman,
p11
aVa civil rights activist
p12
aVor a faith leader.
p13
aVHe was that most unlikely of heroes,
p14
aVan economist.
p15
aVHis name was Simon Kuznets
p16
aVand the report that  he delivered was called
p17
aV"National Income, 1929-1932."
p18
aa(lp19
VNow, you might think
p20
aVthis is a rather dry and dull report.
p21
aVAnd you're absolutely right.
p22
aVIt's dry as a bone.
p23
aVBut this report is the foundation
p24
aVof how, today, we judge the  success of countries:
p25
aVwhat we know best as Gross Domestic Product,
p26
aVGDP.
p27
aa(lp28
VGDP has defined and shaped our lives
p29
aVfor the last 80 years.
p30
aVAnd today I want to talk about
p31
aVa different way to measure the success of countries,
p32
aVa different way to define  and shape our lives
p33
aVfor the next 80 years.
p34
aa(lp35
VBut first, we have to understand
p36
aVhow GDP came to dominate our lives.
p37
aVKuznets' report was delivered
p38
aVat a moment of crisis.
p39
aVThe U.S. economy was plummeting
p40
aVinto the Great Depression
p41
aVand policy makers were  struggling to respond.
p42
aVStruggling because they didn't know what was going on.
p43
aVThey didn't have data and statistics.
p44
aVSo what Kuznet's report gave them
p45
aVwas reliable data on what  the U.S. economy
p46
aVwas producing,
p47
aVupdated year by year.
p48
aVAnd armed with this information,
p49
aVpolicy makers were, eventually,
p50
aVable to find a way out  of the slump.
p51
aVAnd because Kuznets' invention
p52
aVwas found to be so useful,
p53
aVit spread around the world.
p54
aVAnd now today, every country
p55
aVproduces GDP statistics.
p56
aa(lp57
VBut, in that first report,
p58
aVKuznets himself delivered a warning.
p59
aVIt's in the introductory chapter.
p60
aVOn page seven he says,
p61
aV"The welfare of a nation can, therefore,
p62
aVscarcely be inferred
p63
aVfrom a measurement of  national income
p64
aVas defined above."
p65
aVIt's not the greatest sound  bite in the world,
p66
aVand it's dressed up in the cautious  language of the economist.
p67
aVBut his message was clear:
p68
aVGDP is a tool
p69
aVto help us measure economic performance.
p70
aVIt's not a measure of our well-being.
p71
aVAnd it shouldn't be a guide  to all decision making.
p72
aa(lp73
VBut we have ignored Kuznets' warning.
p74
aVWe live in a world where
p75
aVGDP is the benchmark of success
p76
aVin a global economy.
p77
aVOur politicians boast when GDP goes up.
p78
aVMarkets move
p79
aVand trillions of dollars of capital
p80
aVmove around the world
p81
aVbased on which countries are going up
p82
aVand which countries  are going down,
p83
aVall measured in GDP.
p84
aVOur societies have become
p85
aVengines to create more GDP.
p86
aa(lp87
VBut we know that GDP is flawed.
p88
aVIt ignores the environment.
p89
aVIt counts bombs and prisons as progress.
p90
aVIt can't count happiness or community.
p91
aVAnd it has nothing to say  about fairness or justice.
p92
aVIs it any surprise that our world,
p93
aVmarching to the drumbeat of GDP,
p94
aVis teetering on the brink of environmental disaster
p95
aVand filled with anger and conflict?
p96
aa(lp97
VWe need a better way to measure our societies,
p98
aVa measure based on the real  things that matter to real people.
p99
aVDo I have enough to eat?
p100
aVCan I read and write?
p101
aVAm I safe?
p102
aVDo I have rights?
p103
aVDo I live in a society where I'm not discriminated against?
p104
aVIs my future and the future of my children  prevented from environmental destruction?
p105
aVThese are questions that GDP
p106
aVdoes not and cannot answer.
p107
aa(lp108
VThere have, of course,
p109
aVbeen efforts in the past
p110
aVto move beyond GDP.
p111
aVBut I believe that we're living
p112
aVin a moment when we
p113
aVare ready for a measurement revolution.
p114
aVWe're ready because we've seen,
p115
aVin the financial crisis of 2008,
p116
aVhow our fetish for economic growth
p117
aVled us so far astray.
p118
aVWe've seen, in the Arab Spring,
p119
aVhow countries like Tunisia
p120
aVwere supposedly economic superstars,
p121
aVbut they were societies
p122
aVthat were seething with discontentment.
p123
aVWe're ready, because today we have the technology
p124
aVto gather and analyze data
p125
aVin ways that would have been unimaginable to Kuznets.
p126
aa(lp127
VToday, I'd like to introduce you  to the Social Progress Index.
p128
aVIt's a measure of the  well-being of society,
p129
aVcompletely separate from GDP.
p130
aVIt's a whole new way of looking at the world.
p131
aVThe Social Progress Index
p132
aVbegins by defining what it
p133
aVmeans to be a good society
p134
aVbased around three dimensions.
p135
aVThe first is, does everyone have the basic needs for survival:
p136
aVfood, water, shelter, safety?
p137
aVSecondly, does everyone have
p138
aVaccess to the building blocks  to improve their lives:
p139
aVeducation, information, health and sustainable environment?
p140
aVAnd then third, does every  individual have access
p141
aVto a chance to pursue their goals
p142
aVand dreams and ambitions
p143
aVfree from obstacles?
p144
aVDo they have rights,
p145
aVfreedom of choice,
p146
aVfreedom from discrimination
p147
aVand access to the the world's most advanced knowledge?
p148
aVTogether, these 12 components
p149
aVform the Social Progress framework.
p150
aVAnd for each of these 12 components,
p151
aVwe have indicators to measure  how countries are performing.
p152
aVNot indicators of effort or intention,
p153
aVbut real achievement.
p154
aVWe don't measure how much a country spends on healthcare,
p155
aVwe measure the length and  quality of people's lives.
p156
aVWe don't measure whether governments pass laws against discrimination,
p157
aVwe measure whether people  experience discrimination.
p158
aa(lp159
VBut what you want to know
p160
aVis who's top, don't you? (Laughter)
p161
aVI knew that, I knew that, I knew that.
p162
aVOkay, I'm going to show you.
p163
aVI'm going to show you on this chart.
p164
aVSo here we are,
p165
aVwhat I've done here is put on the  vertical axis social progress.
p166
aVHigher is better.
p167
aVAnd then, just for comparison,
p168
aVjust for fun,
p169
aVon the horizontal axis is GDP per capita.
p170
aVFurther to the right is more.
p171
aVSo the country in the world
p172
aVwith the highest social progress,
p173
aVthe number one country on social progress
p174
aVis New Zealand.
p175
aV(Applause)
p176
aVWell done! Never been; must go.
p177
aV(Laughter)
p178
aVThe country with the least social progress,
p179
aVI'm sorry to say, is Chad.
p180
aVI've never been; maybe next year.
p181
aV(Laughter)
p182
aVOr maybe the year after.
p183
aa(lp184
VNow, I know what you're thinking.
p185
aVYou're thinking, "Aha,
p186
aVbut New Zealand has a higher GDP
p187
aVthan Chad!"
p188
aVIt's a good point, well made.
p189
aVBut let me show you
p190
aVtwo other countries.
p191
aVHere's the United States \u2014
p192
aVconsiderably richer than New Zealand,
p193
aVbut with a lower level of social progress.
p194
aVAnd then here's Senegal \u2014
p195
aVit's got a higher level of  social progress than Chad,
p196
aVbut the same level of GDP.
p197
aVSo what's going on? Well, look.
p198
aVLet me bring in the rest of  the countries of the world,
p199
aVthe 132 we've been able to measure,
p200
aVeach one represented by a dot.
p201
aVThere we go. Lots of dots.
p202
aVNow, obviously I can't do all of them,
p203
aVso a few highlights for you:
p204
aVThe highest ranked G7 country is Canada.
p205
aVMy country, the United Kingdom,
p206
aVis sort of middling, sort of dull,
p207
aVbut who cares \u2014
p208
aVat least we beat the French.
p209
aV(Laughter)
p210
aVAnd then looking at the  emerging economies,
p211
aVtop of the BRICS,  pleased to say, is Brazil.
p212
aV(Applause)
p213
aVCome on, cheer!
p214
aVGo, Brazil!
p215
aVBeating South Africa,
p216
aVthen Russia,
p217
aVthen China
p218
aVand then India.
p219
aVTucked away on the right-hand side,
p220
aVyou will see a dot of a  country with a lot of GDP
p221
aVbut not a huge amount  of social progress \u2014
p222
aVthat's Kuwait.
p223
aVJust above Brazil
p224
aVis a social progress superpower \u2014
p225
aVthat's Costa Rica.
p226
aVIt's got a level of social progress the same  as some Western European countries,
p227
aVwith a much lower GDP.
p228
aa(lp229
VNow, my slide is getting  a little cluttered
p230
aVand I'd like to step back a bit.
p231
aVSo let me take away these countries,
p232
aVand then pop in the regression line.
p233
aVSo this shows the average relationship
p234
aVbetween GDP and social progress.
p235
aVThe first thing to notice,
p236
aVis that there's lots of noise
p237
aVaround the trend line.
p238
aVAnd what this shows,
p239
aVwhat this empirically demonstrates,
p240
aVis that GDP is not destiny.
p241
aVAt every level of GDP per capita,
p242
aVthere are opportunities for more social progress,
p243
aVrisks of less.
p244
aVThe second thing to notice
p245
aVis that for poor countries,
p246
aVthe curve is really steep.
p247
aVSo what this tells us is that
p248
aVif poor countries can get
p249
aVa little bit of extra GDP,
p250
aVand if they reinvest that
p251
aVin doctors, nurses, water supplies,
p252
aVsanitation, etc.,
p253
aVthere's a lot of social progress bang
p254
aVfor your GDP buck.
p255
aVAnd that's good news, and that's what  we've seen over the last 20, 30 years,
p256
aVwith a lot of people lifted out of poverty
p257
aVby economic growth and good policies
p258
aVin poorer countries.
p259
aa(lp260
VBut go on a bit further up the curve,
p261
aVand then we see it flattening out.
p262
aVEach extra dollar of GDP
p263
aVis buying less and less social progress.
p264
aVAnd with more and more of the world's population
p265
aVliving on this part of the curve,
p266
aVit means GDP is becoming
p267
aVless and less useful
p268
aVas a guide to our development.
p269
aVI'll show you an example of Brazil.
p270
aa(lp271
VHere's Brazil:
p272
aVsocial progress of about 70 out of 100,
p273
aVGDP per capita about  14,000 dollars a year.
p274
aVAnd look, Brazil's above the line.
p275
aVBrazil is doing a reasonably good job
p276
aVof turning GDP into social progress.
p277
aVBut where does Brazil go next?
p278
aVLet's say that Brazil
p279
aVadopts a bold economic plan
p280
aVto double GDP in the next decade.
p281
aVBut that is only half a plan.
p282
aVIt's less than half a plan,
p283
aVbecause where does Brazil want to go on social progress?
p284
aVBrazil, it's possible
p285
aVto increase your growth,
p286
aVincrease your GDP,
p287
aVwhile stagnating or going backwards
p288
aVon social progress.
p289
aVWe don't want Brazil
p290
aVto become like Russia.
p291
aVWhat you really want is for Brazil
p292
aVto get ever more efficient at creating  social progress from its GDP,
p293
aVso it becomes more like New Zealand.
p294
aVAnd what that means is that
p295
aVBrazil needs to prioritize social progress
p296
aVin its development plan
p297
aVand see that it's not just growth alone,
p298
aVit's growth with social progress.
p299
aVAnd that's what the Social  Progress Index does:
p300
aVIt reframes the debate about development,
p301
aVnot just about GDP alone,
p302
aVbut inclusive, sustainable growth
p303
aVthat brings real improvements  in people's lives.
p304
aVAnd it's not just about countries.
p305
aa(lp306
VEarlier this year,
p307
aVwith our friends from the Imazon  nonprofit here in Brazil,
p308
aVwe launched the first subnational  Social Progress Index.
p309
aVWe did it for the Amazon region.
p310
aVIt's an area the size of  Europe, 24 million people,
p311
aVone of the most deprived  parts of the country.
p312
aVAnd here are the results,
p313
aVand this is broken down
p314
aVinto nearly 800 different municipalities.
p315
aVAnd with this detailed information
p316
aVabout the real quality of life
p317
aVin this part of the country,
p318
aVImazon and other partners
p319
aVfrom government,  business and civil society
p320
aVcan work together to construct
p321
aVa development plan
p322
aVthat will help really improve people's lives,
p323
aVwhile protecting that  precious global asset
p324
aVthat is the Amazon Rainforest.
p325
aVAnd this is just the beginning,
p326
aVYou can create a Social Progress Index
p327
aVfor any state, region,  city or municipality.
p328
aVWe all know and love TEDx;
p329
aVthis is Social Pogress-x.
p330
aVThis is a tool for anyone to come and use.
p331
aa(lp332
VContrary to the way we  sometimes talk about it,
p333
aVGDP was not handed down from  God on tablets of stone. (Laughter)
p334
aVIt's a measurement tool invented in the 20th century
p335
aVto address the challenges of the 20th century.
p336
aVIn the 21st century,
p337
aVwe face new challenges:
p338
aVaging, obesity, climate change, and so on.
p339
aVTo face those challenges,
p340
aVwe need new tools of measurement,
p341
aVnew ways of valuing progress.
p342
aa(lp343
VImagine if we could measure
p344
aVwhat nonprofits, charities,
p345
aVvolunteers, civil society organizations
p346
aVreally contribute to our society.
p347
aVImagine if businesses competed
p348
aVnot just on the basis of their economic contribution,
p349
aVbut on their contribution  to social progress.
p350
aVImagine if we could hold  politicians to account
p351
aVfor really improving people's lives.
p352
aVImagine if we could work together \u2014
p353
aVgovernment, business,  civil society, me, you \u2014
p354
aVand make this century the  century of social progress.
p355
aVThank you.
