VI would like to tell you about the most embarrassing thing
p4
aVthat has ever happened to me in my years of working as a palliative care physician.
p5
aVThis happened a couple of years ago.
p6
aVI was asked as a consultant to see a woman in her 70s \u2014
p7
aVretired English professor who had pancreatic cancer.
p8
aVI was asked to see her because she had pain, nausea, vomiting ...
p9
aVWhen I went to see her, we talked about those symptoms
p10
aVand in the course of that consultation,
p11
aVshe asked me whether I thought that medical marijuana might help her.
p12
aVI thought back to everything
p13
aVthat I had learned in medical school about medical marijuana,
p14
aVwhich didn't take very long because I had learned absolutely nothing.
p15
aVAnd so I told her that as far as I knew,
p16
aVmedical marijuana had no benefits whatsoever.
p17
aVAnd she smiled and nodded and reached into the handbag next to the bed,
p18
aVand pulled out a stack of about a dozen randomized controlled trials
p19
aVshowing that medical marijuana has benefits
p20
aVfor symptoms like nausea and pain and anxiety.
p21
aVShe handed me those articles and said,
p22
aV"Maybe you should read these before offering an opinion ...
p23
aVdoctor."
p24
aa(lp25
V(Laughter)
p26
aa(lp27
VSo I did.
p28
aVThat night I read all of those articles and found a bunch more.
p29
aVWhen I came to see her the next morning,
p30
aVI had to admit that it looks like there is some evidence
p31
aVthat marijuana can offer medical benefits
p32
aVand I suggested that if she really was interested,
p33
aVshe should try it.
p34
aVYou know what she said?
p35
aVThis 73-year-old, retired English professor?
p36
aVShe said, "I did try it about six months ago.
p37
aVIt was amazing.
p38
aVI've been using it every day since.
p39
aVIt's the best drug I've discovered.
p40
aVI don't know why it took me 73 years to discover this stuff. It's amazing."
p41
aa(lp42
V(Laughter)
p43
aa(lp44
VThat was the moment at which I realized
p45
aVI needed to learn something about medical marijuana
p46
aVbecause what I was prepared for in medical school
p47
aVbore no relationship to reality.
p48
aa(lp49
VSo I started reading more articles, I started talking to researchers,
p50
aVI started talking to doctors,
p51
aVand most importantly, I started listening to patients.
p52
aVI ended up writing a book based on those conversations,
p53
aVand that book really revolved around three surprises \u2014
p54
aVsurprises to me, anyway.
p55
aVOne I already alluded to \u2014
p56
aVthat there really are some benefits to medical marijuana.
p57
aVThose benefits may not be as huge or as stunning
p58
aVas some of the most avid proponents of medical marijuana
p59
aVwould have us believe,
p60
aVbut they are real.
p61
aVSurprise number two:
p62
aVmedical marijuana does have some risks.
p63
aVThose risks may not be as huge and as scary
p64
aVas some of the opponents of medical marijuana would have us believe,
p65
aVbut they are real risks, nonetheless.
p66
aVBut it was the third surprise that was most ...
p67
aVsurprising.
p68
aVAnd that is that a lot of the patients I talked with
p69
aVwho've turned to medical marijuana for help,
p70
aVweren't turning to medical marijuana because of its benefits
p71
aVor the balance of risks and benefits,
p72
aVor because they thought it was a wonder drug,
p73
aVbut because it gave them control over their illness.
p74
aVIt let them manage their health
p75
aVin a way that was productive and efficient
p76
aVand effective and comfortable for them.
p77
aa(lp78
VTo show you what I mean, let me tell you about another patient.
p79
aVRobin was in her early 40s when I met her.
p80
aVShe looked though like she was in her late 60s.
p81
aVShe had suffered from rheumatoid arthritis for the last 20 years,
p82
aVher hands were gnarled by arthritis,
p83
aVher spine was crooked,
p84
aVshe had to rely on a wheelchair to get around.
p85
aVShe looked weak and frail,
p86
aVand I guess physically she probably was,
p87
aVbut emotionally, cognitively, psychologically,
p88
aVshe was among the toughest people I've ever met.
p89
aVAnd when I sat down next to her
p90
aVin a medical marijuana dispensary in Northern California
p91
aVto ask her about why she turned to medical marijuana,
p92
aVwhat it did for her and how it helped her,
p93
aVshe started out by telling me things
p94
aVthat I had heard from many patients before.
p95
aVIt helped with her anxiety;
p96
aVit helped with her pain;
p97
aVwhen her pain was better, she slept better.
p98
aVAnd I'd heard all that before.
p99
aVBut then she said something that I'd never heard before,
p100
aVand that is that it gave her control over her life
p101
aVand over her health.
p102
aVShe could use it when she wanted,
p103
aVin the way that she wanted,
p104
aVat the dose and frequency that worked for her.
p105
aVAnd if it didn't work for her, then she could make changes.
p106
aVEverything was up to her.
p107
aVThe most important thing she said
p108
aVwas she didn't need anybody else's permission \u2014
p109
aVnot a clinic appointment, not a doctor's prescription,
p110
aVnot a pharmacist's order.
p111
aVIt was all up to her.
p112
aVShe was in control.
p113
aa(lp114
VAnd if that seems like a little thing for somebody with chronic illness,
p115
aVit's not \u2014 not at all.
p116
aVWhen we face a chronic serious illness,
p117
aVwhether it's rheumatoid arthritis or lupus or cancer or diabetes,
p118
aVor cirrhosis,
p119
aVwe lose control.
p120
aVAnd note what I said: "when," not "if."
p121
aVAll of us at some point in our lives will face a chronic serious illness
p122
aVthat causes us to lose control.
p123
aVWe'll see our function decline, some of us will see our cognition decline,
p124
aVwe'll be no longer able to care for ourselves,
p125
aVto do the things that we want to do.
p126
aVOur bodies will betray us,
p127
aVand in that process, we'll lose control.
p128
aVAnd that's scary.
p129
aVNot just scary \u2014 that's frightening,
p130
aVit's terrifying.
p131
aVWhen I talk to my patients, my palliative care patients,
p132
aVmany of whom are facing illnesses that will end their lives,
p133
aVthey have a lot of be frightened of \u2014
p134
aVpain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, fatigue,
p135
aVtheir impending mortality.
p136
aVBut what scares them more than anything else
p137
aVis this possibility that at some point,
p138
aVtomorrow or a month from now,
p139
aVthey're going to lose control of their health,
p140
aVof their lives,
p141
aVof their healthcare,
p142
aVand they're going to become dependent on others,
p143
aVand that's terrifying.
p144
aa(lp145
VSo it's no wonder really that patients like Robin,
p146
aVwho I just told you about,
p147
aVwho I met in that clinic,
p148
aVturn to medical marijuana
p149
aVto try to claw back some semblance of control.
p150
aVHow do they do it though?
p151
aVHow do these medical marijuana dispensaries \u2014
p152
aVlike the one where I met Robin \u2014
p153
aVhow do they give patients like Robin back the sort of control that they need?
p154
aVAnd how do they do it
p155
aVin a way that mainstream medical hospitals and clinics,
p156
aVat least for Robin, weren't able to?
p157
aVWhat's their secret?
p158
aVSo I decided to find out.
p159
aa(lp160
VI went to a seedy clinic in Venice Beach in California
p161
aVand got a recommendation
p162
aVthat would allow me to be a medical marijuana patient.
p163
aVI got a letter of recommendation that would let me buy medical marijuana.
p164
aVI got that recommendation illegally,
p165
aVbecause I'm not a resident of California \u2014
p166
aVI should note that.
p167
aVI should also note, for the record,
p168
aVthat I never used that letter of recommendation to make a purchase,
p169
aVand to all of you DEA agents out there \u2014
p170
aa(lp171
V(Laughter)
p172
aa(lp173
Vlove the work that you're doing,
p174
aVkeep it up.
p175
aa(lp176
V(Laughter)
p177
aa(lp178
VEven though it didn't let me make a purchase though,
p179
aVthat letter was priceless because it let me be a patient.
p180
aVIt let me experience what patients like Robin experience
p181
aVwhen they go to a medical marijuana dispensary.
p182
aVAnd what I experienced \u2014
p183
aVwhat they experience every day,
p184
aVhundreds of thousands of people like Robin \u2014
p185
aVwas really amazing.
p186
aVI walked into the clinic,
p187
aVand from the moment that I entered many of these clinics and dispensaries,
p188
aVI felt like that dispensary, that clinic,
p189
aVwas there for me.
p190
aVThere were questions at the outset about who I am,
p191
aVwhat kind of work I do,
p192
aVwhat my goals are in looking for a medical marijuana prescription,
p193
aVor product,
p194
aVwhat my goals are, what my preferences are,
p195
aVwhat my hopes are,
p196
aVhow do I think, how do I hope this might help me,
p197
aVwhat am I afraid of.
p198
aVThese are the sorts of questions
p199
aVthat patients like Robin get asked all the time.
p200
aVThese are the sorts of questions that make me confident
p201
aVthat the person I'm talking with really has my best interests at heart
p202
aVand wants to get to know me.
p203
aa(lp204
VThe second thing I learned in those clinics
p205
aVis the availability of education.
p206
aVEducation from the folks behind the counter,
p207
aVbut also education from folks in the waiting room.
p208
aVPeople I met were more than happy, as I was sitting next to them \u2014
p209
aVpeople like Robin \u2014
p210
aVto tell me about who they are, why they use medical marijuana,
p211
aVwhat helps them, how it helps them,
p212
aVand to give me advice and suggestions.
p213
aVThose waiting rooms really are a hive of interaction, advice and support.
p214
aa(lp215
VAnd third, the folks behind the counter.
p216
aVI was amazed at how willing those people were
p217
aVto spend sometimes an hour or more talking me through the nuances
p218
aVof this strain versus that strain,
p219
aVsmoking versus vaporizing,
p220
aVedibles versus tinctures \u2014
p221
aVall, remember, without me making any purchase whatsoever.
p222
aVThink about the last time you went to any hospital or clinic
p223
aVand the last time anybody spent an hour explaining those sorts of things to you.
p224
aVThe fact that patients like Robin are going to these clinics,
p225
aVare going to these dispensaries
p226
aVand getting that sort of personalized attention
p227
aVand education and service,
p228
aVreally should be a wake-up call to the healthcare system.
p229
aVPeople like Robin are turning away from mainstream medicine,
p230
aVturning to medical marijuana dispensaries
p231
aVbecause those dispensaries are giving them what they need.
p232
aa(lp233
VIf that's a wake-up call to the medical establishment,
p234
aVit's a wake-up call that many of my colleagues are either not hearing
p235
aVor not wanting to hear.
p236
aVWhen I talk to my colleagues, physicians in particular,
p237
aVabout medical marijuana,
p238
aVthey say, "Oh, we need more evidence.
p239
aVWe need more research into benefits, we need more evidence about risks."
p240
aVAnd you know what? They're right.
p241
aVThey're absolutely right.
p242
aVWe do need much more evidence about the benefits of medical marijuana.
p243
aVWe also need to ask the federal government to reschedule marijuana to Schedule II,
p244
aVor to deschedule it entirely to make that research possible.
p245
aVWe also need more research into medical marijuana's risks.
p246
aVMedical marijuana's risks \u2014
p247
aVwe know a lot about the risks of recreational use,
p248
aVwe know next to nothing about the risks of medical marijuana.
p249
aVSo we absolutely do need research,
p250
aVbut to say that we need research
p251
aVand not that we need to make any changes now
p252
aVis to miss the point entirely.
p253
aVPeople like Robin aren't seeking out medical marijuana
p254
aVbecause they think it's a wonder drug,
p255
aVor because they think it's entirely risk-free.
p256
aVThey seek it out because the context in which it's delivered and administered
p257
aVand used,
p258
aVgives them the sort of control they need over their lives.
p259
aVAnd that's a wake-up call we really need to pay attention to.
p260
aa(lp261
VThe good news though is that there are lessons we can learn today
p262
aVfrom those medical marijuana dispensaries.
p263
aVAnd those are lessons we really should learn.
p264
aVThese are often small, mom-and-pop operations
p265
aVrun by people with no medical training.
p266
aVAnd while it's embarrassing to think
p267
aVthat many of these clinics and dispensaries are providing services
p268
aVand support and meeting patients' needs
p269
aVin ways that billion-dollar healthcare systems aren't \u2014
p270
aVwe should be embarrassed by that \u2014
p271
aVbut we can also learn from that.
p272
aVAnd there are probably three lessons at least
p273
aVthat we can learn from those small dispensaries.
p274
aa(lp275
VOne: we need to find ways to give patients more control
p276
aVin small but important ways.
p277
aVHow to interact with healthcare providers,
p278
aVwhen to interact with healthcare providers,
p279
aVhow to use medications in ways that work for them.
p280
aVIn my own practice,
p281
aVI've gotten much more creative and flexible
p282
aVin supporting my patients in using drugs safely
p283
aVto manage their symptoms \u2014
p284
aVwith the emphasis on safely.
p285
aVMany of the drugs I prescribe are drugs like opioids or benzodiazepines
p286
aVwhich can be dangerous if overused.
p287
aVBut here's the point.
p288
aVThey can be dangerous if they're overused,
p289
aVbut they can also be ineffective if they're not used in a way
p290
aVthat's consistent with what patients want and need.
p291
aVSo that flexibility, if it's delivered safely,
p292
aVcan be extraordinarily valuable for patients and their families.
p293
aVThat's number one.
p294
aa(lp295
VNumber two: education.
p296
aVHuge opportunities
p297
aVto learn from some of the tricks of those medical marijuana dispensaries
p298
aVto provide more education
p299
aVthat doesn't require a lot of physician time necessarily,
p300
aVor any physician time,
p301
aVbut opportunities to learn about what medications we're using
p302
aVand why,
p303
aVprognoses, trajectories of illness,
p304
aVand most importantly,
p305
aVopportunities for patients to learn from each other.
p306
aVHow can we replicate what goes on
p307
aVin those clinic and medical dispensary waiting rooms?
p308
aVHow patients learn from each other, how people share with each other.
p309
aa(lp310
VAnd last but not least,
p311
aVputting patients first the way those medical marijuana dispensaries do,
p312
aVmaking patients feel legitimately like what they want,
p313
aVwhat they need,
p314
aVis why, as healthcare providers,
p315
aVwe're here.
p316
aVAsking patients about their hopes, their fears, their goals and preferences.
p317
aVAs a palliative care provider,
p318
aVI ask all my patients what they're hoping for and what they're afraid of.
p319
aVBut here's the thing.
p320
aVPatients shouldn't have to wait until they're chronically seriously ill,
p321
aVoften near the end of life,
p322
aVthey shouldn't have to wait until they're seeing a physician like me
p323
aVbefore somebody asks them,
p324
aV"What are you hoping for?"
p325
aV"What are you afraid of?"
p326
aVThat should be baked into the way that healthcare is delivered.
p327
aa(lp328
VWe can do this \u2014
p329
aVwe really can.
p330
aVMedical marijuana dispensaries and clinics all across the country
p331
aVare figuring this out.
p332
aVThey're figuring this out
p333
aVin ways that larger, more mainstream health systems are years behind.
p334
aVBut we can learn from them,
p335
aVand we have to learn from them.
p336
aVAll we have to do is swallow our pride \u2014
p337
aVput aside the thought for a minute
p338
aVthat because we have lots of letters after our name,
p339
aVbecause we're experts,
p340
aVbecause we're chief medical officers of a large healthcare system,
p341
aVwe know all there is to know about how to meet patients' needs.
p342
aa(lp343
VWe need to swallow our pride.
p344
aVWe need to go visit a few medical marijuana dispensaries.
p345
aVWe need to figure out what they're doing.
p346
aVWe need to figure out why so many patients like Robin
p347
aVare leaving our mainstream medical clinics
p348
aVand going to these medical marijuana dispensaries instead.
p349
aVWe need to figure out what their tricks are,
p350
aVwhat their tools are,
p351
aVand we need to learn from them.
p352
aVIf we do,
p353
aVand I think we can, and I absolutely think we have to,
p354
aVwe can guarantee all of our patients will have a much better experience.
p355
aa(lp356
