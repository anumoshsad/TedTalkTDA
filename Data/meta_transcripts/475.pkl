VI was walking in the market one day with my wife,
p4
aVand somebody stuck a cage in my face.
p5
aVAnd in between those slits
p6
aVwere the saddest eyes I've ever seen.
p7
aVThere was a very sick orangutan baby, my first encounter.
p8
aVThat evening I came back to the market in the dark
p9
aVand I heard "uhh, uhh,"
p10
aVand sure enough I found a dying orangutan baby on a garbage heap.
p11
aVOf course, the cage was salvaged.
p12
aVI took up the little baby,
p13
aVmassaged her, forced her to drink
p14
aVuntil she finally started breathing normally.
p15
aa(lp16
VThis is Uce.
p17
aVShe's now living in the jungle of Sungai Wain,
p18
aVand this is Matahari, her second son,
p19
aVwhich, by the way, is also the son of the second orangutan I rescued, Dodoy.
p20
aVThat changed my life quite dramatically,
p21
aVand as of today, I have almost 1,000 babies in my two centers.
p22
aa(lp23
V(Applause)
p24
aa(lp25
VNo. No. No. Wrong.
p26
aVIt's horrible. It's a proof of our failing to save them in the wild.
p27
aVIt's not good.
p28
aVThis is merely proof of everyone failing to do the right thing.
p29
aVHaving more than all the orangutans in all the zoos in the world together,
p30
aVjust now like victims for every baby,
p31
aVsix have disappeared from the forest.
p32
aa(lp33
VThe deforestation, especially for oil palm,
p34
aVto provide biofuel for Western countries
p35
aVis what's causing these problems.
p36
aVAnd those are the peat swamp forests on 20 meters of peat,
p37
aVthe largest accumulation of organic material in the world.
p38
aVWhen you open this for growing oil palms
p39
aVyou're creating CO2 volcanoes
p40
aVthat are emitting so much CO2
p41
aVthat my country is now the third largest emitter of greenhouse gasses in the world,
p42
aVafter China and the United States.
p43
aVAnd we don't have any industry at all \u2014
p44
aVit's only because of this deforestation.
p45
aa(lp46
VAnd these are horrible images.
p47
aVI'm not going to talk too long about it,
p48
aVbut there are so many of the family of Uce,
p49
aVwhich are not so fortunate to live out there in the forest,
p50
aVthat still have to go through that process.
p51
aVAnd I don't know anymore where to put them.
p52
aVSo I decided that I had to come up with a solution for her
p53
aVbut also a solution
p54
aVthat will benefit the people that are trying to exploit those forests,
p55
aVto get their hands on the last timber
p56
aVand that are causing, in that way,
p57
aVthe loss of habitat and all those victims.
p58
aa(lp59
VSo I created the place Samboja Lestari,
p60
aVand the idea was,
p61
aVif I can do this on the worst possible place that I can think of
p62
aVwhere there is really nothing left,
p63
aVno one will have an excuse to say, "Yeah, but ..."
p64
aVNo. Everyone should be able to follow this.
p65
aa(lp66
VSo we're in East Borneo. This is the place where I started.
p67
aVAs you can see there's only yellow terrain.
p68
aVThere's nothing left \u2014 just a bit of grass there.
p69
aVIn 2002 we had about 50 percent of the people jobless there.
p70
aVThere was a huge amount of crime.
p71
aVPeople spent so much of their money on health issues and drinking water.
p72
aVThere was no agricultural productivity left.
p73
aVThis was the poorest district in the whole province
p74
aVand it was a total extinction of wildlife.
p75
aVThis was like a biological desert.
p76
aVWhen I stood there in the grass, it's hot \u2014 not even the sound of insects \u2014
p77
aVjust this waving grass.
p78
aa(lp79
VStill, four years later we have created jobs for about 3,000 people.
p80
aVThe climate has changed. I will show you:
p81
aVno more flooding, no more fires.
p82
aVIt's no longer the poorest district,
p83
aVand there is a huge development of biodiversity.
p84
aVWe've got over 1,000 species. We have 137 bird species as of today.
p85
aVWe have 30 species of reptiles.
p86
aa(lp87
VSo what happened here? We created a huge economic failure in this forest.
p88
aVSo basically the whole process of destruction
p89
aVhad gone a bit slower than what is happening now with the oil palm.
p90
aVBut we saw the same thing.
p91
aVWe had slash and burn agriculture;
p92
aVpeople cannot afford the fertilizer,
p93
aVso they burn the trees and have the minerals available there;
p94
aVthe fires become more frequent,
p95
aVand after a while you're stuck with an area of land
p96
aVwhere there is no fertility left.
p97
aVThere are no trees left.
p98
aVStill, in this place, in this grassland
p99
aVwhere you can see our very first office there on that hill,
p100
aVfour years later, there is this one green blop on the Earth's surface ...
p101
aa(lp102
V(Applause)
p103
aa(lp104
VAnd there are all these animals, and all these people happy,
p105
aVand there's this economic value.
p106
aa(lp107
VSo how's this possible?
p108
aVIt was quite simple. If you'll look at the steps:
p109
aVwe bought the land, we dealt with the fire,
p110
aVand then only, we started doing the reforestation
p111
aVby combining agriculture with forestry.
p112
aVOnly then we set up the infrastructure and management and the monetary.
p113
aVBut we made sure that in every step of the way
p114
aVthe local people were going to be fully involved
p115
aVso that no outside forces would be able to interfere with that.
p116
aVThe people would become the defenders of that forest.
p117
aVSo we do the "people, profit, planet" principles,
p118
aVbut we do it in addition
p119
aVto a sure legal status \u2014
p120
aVbecause if the forest belongs to the state,
p121
aVpeople say, "It belongs to me, it belongs to everyone."
p122
aVAnd then we apply all these other principles
p123
aVlike transparency, professional management, measurable results,
p124
aVscalability, [unclear], etc.
p125
aa(lp126
VWhat we did was we formulated recipes \u2014
p127
aVhow to go from a starting situation where you have nothing
p128
aVto a target situation.
p129
aVYou formulate a recipe based upon the factors you can control,
p130
aVwhether it be the skills or the fertilizer or the plant choice.
p131
aVAnd then you look at the outputs and you start measuring what comes out.
p132
aVNow in this recipe you also have the cost.
p133
aVYou also know how much labor is needed.
p134
aVIf you can drop this recipe on the map
p135
aVon a sandy soil, on a clay soil,
p136
aVon a steep slope, on flat soil,
p137
aVyou put those different recipes; if you combine them,
p138
aVout of that comes a business plan,
p139
aVcomes a work plan, and you can optimize it
p140
aVfor the amount of labor you have available or for the amount of fertilizer you have,
p141
aVand you can do it.
p142
aa(lp143
VThis is how it looks like in practice. We have this grass we want to get rid of.
p144
aVIt exudes [unclear]-like compounds from the roots.
p145
aVThe acacia trees are of a very low value
p146
aVbut we need them to restore the micro-climate, to protect the soil
p147
aVand to shake out the grasses.
p148
aVAnd after eight years they might actually yield some timber \u2014
p149
aVthat is, if you can preserve it in the right way,
p150
aVwhich we can do with bamboo peels.
p151
aVIt's an old temple-building technique from Japan
p152
aVbut bamboo is very fire-susceptible.
p153
aVSo if we would plant that in the beginning
p154
aVwe would have a very high risk of losing everything again.
p155
aVSo we plant it later, along the waterways
p156
aVto filter the water, provide the raw products
p157
aVjust in time for when the timber becomes available.
p158
aa(lp159
VSo the idea is: how to integrate these flows
p160
aVin space, over time and with the limited means you have.
p161
aVSo we plant the trees, we plant these pineapples
p162
aVand beans and ginger in between, to reduce the competition for the trees,
p163
aVthe crop fertilizer. Organic material is useful for the agricultural crops,
p164
aVfor the people, but also helps the trees. The farmers have free land,
p165
aVthe system yields early income, the orangutans get healthy food
p166
aVand we can speed up ecosystem regeneration
p167
aVwhile even saving some money.
p168
aa(lp169
VSo beautiful. What a theory.
p170
aa(lp171
VBut is it really that easy?
p172
aVNot really, because if you looked at what happened in 1998,
p173
aVthe fire started.
p174
aVThis is an area of about 50 million hectares.
p175
aVJanuary.
p176
aVFebruary.
p177
aVMarch.
p178
aVApril.
p179
aVMay.
p180
aVWe lost 5.5 million hectares in just a matter of a few months.
p181
aVThis is because we have 10,000 of those underground fires
p182
aVthat you also have in Pennsylvania here in the United States.
p183
aVAnd once the soil gets dried, you're in a dry season \u2014 you get cracks,
p184
aVoxygen goes in, flames come out and the problem starts all over again.
p185
aa(lp186
VSo how to break that cycle?
p187
aVFire is the biggest problem.
p188
aVThis is what it looked like for three months.
p189
aVFor three months, the automatic lights outside did not go off
p190
aVbecause it was that dark.
p191
aVWe lost all the crops. No children gained weight for over a year;
p192
aVthey lost 12 IQ points. It was a disaster
p193
aVfor orangutans and people.
p194
aVSo these fires are really the first things to work on.
p195
aVThat was why I put it as a single point up there.
p196
aVAnd you need the local people for that because these grasslands,
p197
aVonce they start burning ... It goes through it like a windstorm
p198
aVand you lose again the last bit of ash and nutrients
p199
aVto the first rainfall \u2014 going to the sea
p200
aVkilling off the coral reefs there.
p201
aa(lp202
VSo you have to do it with the local people.
p203
aVThat is the short-term solution but you also need a long-term solution.
p204
aVSo what we did is, we created
p205
aVa ring of sugar palms around the area.
p206
aVThese sugar palms turn out to be fire-resistant \u2014
p207
aValso flood-resistant, by the way \u2014
p208
aVand they provide a lot of income for local people.
p209
aa(lp210
VThis is what it looks like:
p211
aVthe people have to tap them twice a day \u2014 just a millimeter slice \u2014
p212
aVand the only thing you harvest is sugar water,
p213
aVcarbon dioxide, rain fall and a little bit of sunshine.
p214
aVIn principle, you make those trees into
p215
aVbiological photovoltaic cells.
p216
aVAnd you can create so much energy from this \u2014
p217
aVthey produce three times more energy per hectare per year,
p218
aVbecause you can tap them on a daily basis.
p219
aVYou don't need to harvest [unclear]
p220
aVor any other of the crops.
p221
aa(lp222
VSo this is the combination where we have all this genetic potential in the tropics,
p223
aVwhich is still unexploited, and doing it in combination with technology.
p224
aVBut also your legal side needs to be in very good order.
p225
aVSo we bought that land,
p226
aVand here is where we started our project \u2014
p227
aVin the middle of nowhere.
p228
aVAnd if you zoom in a bit you can see that all of this area
p229
aVis divided into strips that go over different types of soil,
p230
aVand we were actually monitoring,
p231
aVmeasuring every single tree in these 2,000 hectares, 5,000 acres.
p232
aVAnd this forest is quite different.
p233
aa(lp234
VWhat I really did was I just followed nature,
p235
aVand nature doesn't know monocultures,
p236
aVbut a natural forest is multilayered.
p237
aVThat means that both in the ground and above the ground
p238
aVit can make better use of the available light,
p239
aVit can store more carbon in the system, it can provide more functions.
p240
aVBut, it's more complicated. It's not that simple, and you have to work with the people.
p241
aa(lp242
VSo, just like nature,
p243
aVwe also grow fast planting trees and underneath that,
p244
aVwe grow the slower growing, primary-grain forest trees of a very high diversity
p245
aVthat can optimally use that light. Then,
p246
aVwhat is just as important: get the right fungi in there
p247
aVthat will grow into those leaves, bring back the nutrients
p248
aVto the roots of the trees that have just dropped that leaf within 24 hours.
p249
aVAnd they become like nutrient pumps.
p250
aVYou need the bacteria to fix nitrogen,
p251
aVand without those microorganisms, you won't have any performance at all.
p252
aa(lp253
VAnd then we started planting \u2014 only 1,000 trees a day.
p254
aVWe could have planted many, many more, but we didn't want to
p255
aVbecause we wanted to keep the number of jobs stable.
p256
aVWe didn't want to lose the people
p257
aVthat are going to work in that plantation.
p258
aVAnd we do a lot of work here.
p259
aVWe use indicator plants to look at what soil types,
p260
aVor what vegetables will grow, or what trees will grow here.
p261
aVAnd we have monitored every single one of those trees from space.
p262
aa(lp263
VThis is what it looks like in reality;
p264
aVyou have this irregular ring around it,
p265
aVwith strips of 100 meters wide, with sugar palms
p266
aVthat can provide income for 648 families.
p267
aVIt's only a small part of the area.
p268
aa(lp269
VThe nursery, in here, is quite different.
p270
aVIf you look at the number of tree species we have in Europe, for instance,
p271
aVfrom the Urals up to England, you know how many?
p272
aV165.
p273
aVIn this nursery, we're going to grow 10 times more than the number of species.
p274
aVCan you imagine?
p275
aVYou do need to know what you are working with,
p276
aVbut it's that diversity which makes it work.
p277
aVThat you can go from this zero situation,
p278
aVby planting the vegetables and the trees, or directly, the trees
p279
aVin the lines in that grass there,
p280
aVputting up the buffer zone, producing your compost,
p281
aVand then making sure that at every stage of that up growing forest
p282
aVthere are crops that can be used.
p283
aVIn the beginning, maybe pineapples and beans and corn;
p284
aVin the second phase, there will be bananas and papayas;
p285
aVlater on, there will be chocolate and chilies.
p286
aVAnd then slowly, the trees start taking over,
p287
aVbringing in produce from the fruits, from the timber, from the fuel wood.
p288
aVAnd finally, the sugar palm forest takes over
p289
aVand provides the people with permanent income.
p290
aa(lp291
VOn the top left, underneath those green stripes,
p292
aVyou see some white dots \u2014 those are actually individual pineapple plants
p293
aVthat you can see from space.
p294
aVAnd in that area we started growing some acacia trees
p295
aVthat you just saw before.
p296
aVSo this is after one year.
p297
aVAnd this is after two years.
p298
aVAnd that's green. If you look from the tower \u2014
p299
aVthis is when we start attacking the grass.
p300
aVWe plant in the seedlings
p301
aVmixed with the bananas, the papayas, all the crops for the local people,
p302
aVbut the trees are growing up fast in between as well.
p303
aVAnd three years later, 137 species of birds are living here.
p304
aa(lp305
V(Applause)
p306
aa(lp307
VSo we lowered air temperature three to five degrees Celsius.
p308
aVAir humidity is up 10 percent.
p309
aVCloud cover \u2014 I'm going to show it to you \u2014 is up.
p310
aVRainfall is up.
p311
aVAnd all these species and income.
p312
aa(lp313
VThis ecolodge that I built here,
p314
aVthree years before, was an empty, yellow field.
p315
aVThis transponder that we operate with the European Space Agency \u2014
p316
aVit gives us the benefit that every satellite that comes over to calibrate itself
p317
aVis taking a picture.
p318
aVThose pictures we use to analyze how much carbon, how the forest is developing,
p319
aVand we can monitor every tree using satellite images through our cooperation.
p320
aVWe can use these data now
p321
aVto provide other regions with recipes and the same technology.
p322
aVWe actually have it already with Google Earth.
p323
aVIf you would use a little bit of your technology to put tracking devices in trucks,
p324
aVand use Google Earth in combination with that,
p325
aVyou could directly tell what palm oil has been sustainably produced,
p326
aVwhich company is stealing the timber,
p327
aVand you could save so much more carbon
p328
aVthan with any measure of saving energy here.
p329
aa(lp330
VSo this is the Samboja Lestari area.
p331
aVYou measure how the trees grow back,
p332
aVbut you can also measure the biodiversity coming back.
p333
aVAnd biodiversity is an indicator of how much water can be balanced,
p334
aVhow many medicines can be kept here.
p335
aVAnd finally I made it into the rain machine
p336
aVbecause this forest is now creating its own rain.
p337
aVThis nearby city of Balikpapan has a big problem with water;
p338
aVit's 80 percent surrounded by seawater,
p339
aVand we have now a lot of intrusion there.
p340
aVNow we looked at the clouds above this forest;
p341
aVwe looked at the reforestation area, the semi-open area and the open area.
p342
aa(lp343
VAnd look at these images.
p344
aVI'll just run them very quickly through.
p345
aVIn the tropics, raindrops are not formed from ice crystals,
p346
aVwhich is the case in the temperate zones,
p347
aVyou need the trees with [unclear], chemicals that come out of the leaves of the trees
p348
aVthat initiate the raindrops.
p349
aVSo you create a cool place where clouds can accumulate,
p350
aVand you have the trees to initiate the rain.
p351
aVAnd look, there's now 11.2 percent more clouds \u2014
p352
aValready, after three years.
p353
aVIf you look at rainfall, it was already up 20 percent at that time.
p354
aVLet's look at the next year,
p355
aVand you can see that that trend is continuing.
p356
aVWhere at first we had a small cap of higher rainfall,
p357
aVthat cap is now widening and getting higher.
p358
aVAnd if we look at the rainfall pattern
p359
aVabove Samboja Lestari, it used to be the driest place,
p360
aVbut now you see consistently see a peak of rain forming there.
p361
aVSo you can actually change the climate.
p362
aVWhen there are trade winds of course the effect disappears,
p363
aVbut afterwards, as soon as the wind stabilizes,
p364
aVyou see again that the rainfall peaks come back above this area.
p365
aa(lp366
VSo to say it is hopeless is not the right thing to do,
p367
aVbecause we actually can make that difference
p368
aVif you integrate the various technologies.
p369
aVAnd it's nice to have the science, but it still depends mostly upon the people,
p370
aVon your education.
p371
aVWe have our farmer schools.
p372
aVBut the real success of course, is our band \u2014
p373
aVbecause if a baby is born, we will play, so everyone's our family
p374
aVand you don't make trouble with your family.
p375
aa(lp376
VThis is how it looks.
p377
aVWe have this road going around the area,
p378
aVwhich brings the people electricity and water from our own area.
p379
aVWe have the zone with the sugar palms,
p380
aVand then we have this fence with very thorny palms
p381
aVto keep the orangutans \u2014 that we provide with a place to live in the middle \u2014
p382
aVand the people apart.
p383
aVAnd inside, we have this area for reforestation
p384
aVas a gene bank to keep all that material alive,
p385
aVbecause for the last 12 years
p386
aVnot a single seedling of the tropical hardwood trees has grown up
p387
aVbecause the climatic triggers have disappeared.
p388
aVAll the seeds get eaten.
p389
aa(lp390
VSo now we do the monitoring on the inside \u2014
p391
aVfrom towers, satellites, ultralights.
p392
aVEach of the families that have sold their land now get a piece of land back.
p393
aVAnd it has two nice fences of tropical hardwood trees \u2014
p394
aVyou have the shade trees planted in year one,
p395
aVthen you underplanted with the sugar palms,
p396
aVand you plant this thorny fence.
p397
aVAnd after a few years, you can remove some of those shade trees.
p398
aVThe people get that acacia timber which we have preserved with the bamboo peel,
p399
aVand they can build a house, they have some fuel wood to cook with.
p400
aVAnd they can start producing from the trees as many as they like.
p401
aVThey have enough income for three families.
p402
aVBut whatever you do in that program, it has to be fully supported by the people,
p403
aVmeaning that you also have to adjust it to the local, cultural values.
p404
aVThere is no simple one recipe for one place.
p405
aa(lp406
VYou also have to make sure that it is very difficult to corrupt \u2014
p407
aVthat it's transparent.
p408
aVLike here, in Samboja Lestari,
p409
aVwe divide that ring in groups of 20 families.
p410
aVIf one member trespasses the agreement,
p411
aVand does cut down trees,
p412
aVthe other 19 members have to decide what's going to happen to him.
p413
aVIf the group doesn't take action,
p414
aVthe other 33 groups have to decide what is going to happen to the group
p415
aVthat doesn't comply with those great deals that we are offering them.
p416
aa(lp417
VIn North Sulawesi it is the cooperative \u2014
p418
aVthey have a democratic culture there,
p419
aVso there you can use the local justice system to protect your system.
p420
aVIn summary, if you look at it, in year one the people can sell their land
p421
aVto get income, but they get jobs back in the construction and the reforestation,
p422
