VI worked as a war reporter for 15 years
p4
aVbefore I realized that I really had a problem.
p5
aVThere was something really wrong with me.
p6
aa(lp7
VThis was about a year before 9/11, and America wasn't at war yet.
p8
aVWe weren't talking about PTSD.
p9
aVWe were not yet talking about the effect of trauma and war
p10
aVon the human psyche.
p11
aVI'd been in Afghanistan for a couple of months
p12
aVwith the Northern Alliance as they were fighting the Taliban.
p13
aVAnd at that point the Taliban had an air force,
p14
aVthey had fighter planes, they had tanks, they had artillery,
p15
aVand we really got hammered pretty badly a couple of times.
p16
aVWe saw some very ugly things.
p17
aVBut I didn't really think it affected me.
p18
aVI didn't think much about it.
p19
aa(lp20
VI came home to New York, where I live.
p21
aVThen one day I went down into the subway,
p22
aVand for the first time in my life,
p23
aVI knew real fear.
p24
aVI had a massive panic attack.
p25
aVI was way more scared than I had ever been in Afghanistan.
p26
aVEverything I was looking at seemed like it was going to kill me,
p27
aVbut I couldn't explain why.
p28
aVThe trains were going too fast.
p29
aVThere were too many people.
p30
aVThe lights were too bright.
p31
aVEverything was too loud, everything was moving too quickly.
p32
aVI backed up against a support column and just waited for it.
p33
aVWhen I couldn't take it any longer, I ran out of the subway station
p34
aVand walked wherever I was going.
p35
aa(lp36
VLater, I found out that what I had was short-term PTSD:
p37
aVpost-traumatic stress disorder.
p38
aVWe evolved as animals, as primates, to survive periods of danger,
p39
aVand if your life has been in danger,
p40
aVyou want to react to unfamiliar noises.
p41
aVYou want to sleep lightly, wake up easily.
p42
aVYou want to have nightmares and flashbacks
p43
aVof the thing that could kill you.
p44
aVYou want to be angry because it makes you predisposed to fight,
p45
aVor depressed, because it keeps you out of circulation a little bit.
p46
aVKeeps you safe.
p47
aVIt's not very pleasant, but it's better than getting eaten.
p48
aa(lp49
VMost people recover from that pretty quickly.
p50
aVIt takes a few weeks, a few months.
p51
aVI kept having panic attacks, but they eventually went away.
p52
aVI had no idea it was connected to the war that I'd seen.
p53
aVI just thought I was going crazy,
p54
aVand then I thought, well, now I'm not going crazy anymore.
p55
aa(lp56
VAbout 20 percent of people, however,
p57
aVwind up with chronic, long-term PTSD.
p58
aVThey are not adapted to temporary danger.
p59
aVThey are maladapted for everyday life,
p60
aVunless they get help.
p61
aVWe know that the people who are vulnerable to long-term PTSD
p62
aVare people who were abused as children,
p63
aVwho suffered trauma as children,
p64
aVpeople who have low education levels,
p65
aVpeople who have psychiatric disorders in their family.
p66
aVIf you served in Vietnam
p67
aVand your brother is schizophrenic,
p68
aVyou're way more likely to get long-term PTSD from Vietnam.
p69
aa(lp70
VSo I started to study this as a journalist,
p71
aVand I realized that there was something really strange going on.
p72
aVThe numbers seemed to be going in the wrong direction.
p73
aVEvery war that we have fought as a country,
p74
aVstarting with the Civil War,
p75
aVthe intensity of the combat has gone down.
p76
aVAs a result, the casualty rates have gone down.
p77
aVBut disability rates have gone up.
p78
aVThey should be going in the same direction,
p79
aVbut they're going in different directions.
p80
aa(lp81
VThe recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have produced, thank God,
p82
aVa casualty rate about one third of what it was in Vietnam.
p83
aVBut they've also created \u2014
p84
aVthey've also produced three times the disability rates.
p85
aVAround 10 percent of the US military is actively engaged in combat,
p86
aV10 percent or under.
p87
aVThey're shooting at people, killing people,
p88
aVgetting shot at, seeing their friends get killed.
p89
aVIt's incredibly traumatic.
p90
aVBut it's only about 10 percent of our military.
p91
aVBut about half of our military has filed
p92
aVfor some kind of PTSD compensation from the government.
p93
aa(lp94
VAnd suicide doesn't even fit into this in a very logical way.
p95
aVWe've all heard the tragic statistic of 22 vets a day, on average,
p96
aVin this country, killing themselves.
p97
aVMost people don't realize
p98
aVthat the majority of those suicides are veterans of the Vietnam War,
p99
aVthat generation,
p100
aVand their decision to take their own lives actually might not be related
p101
aVto the war they fought 50 years earlier.
p102
aVIn fact, there's no statistical connection between combat and suicide.
p103
aVIf you're in the military and you're in a lot of combat,
p104
aVyou're no more likely to kill yourself than if you weren't.
p105
aVIn fact, one study found
p106
aVthat if you deploy to Iraq or Afghanistan,
p107
aVyou're actually slightly less likely to commit suicide later.
p108
aa(lp109
VI studied anthropology in college.
p110
aVI did my fieldwork on the Navajo reservation.
p111
aVI wrote a thesis on Navajo long-distance runners.
p112
aVAnd recently, while I was researching PTSD,
p113
aVI had this thought.
p114
aVI thought back to the work I did when I was young,
p115
aVand I thought, I bet the Navajo, the Apache, the Comanche \u2014
p116
aVI mean, these are very warlike nations \u2014
p117
aVI bet they weren't getting PTSD like we do.
p118
aVWhen their warriors came back from fighting the US military
p119
aVor fighting each other,
p120
aVI bet they pretty much just slipped right back into tribal life.
p121
aa(lp122
VAnd maybe what determines
p123
aVthe rate of long-term PTSD
p124
aVisn't what happened out there,
p125
aVbut the kind of society you come back to.
p126
aVAnd maybe if you come back to a close, cohesive, tribal society,
p127
aVyou can get over trauma pretty quickly.
p128
aVAnd if you come back to an alienating, modern society,
p129
aVyou might remain traumatized your entire life.
p130
aVIn other words, maybe the problem isn't them, the vets;
p131
aVmaybe the problem is us.
p132
aa(lp133
VCertainly, modern society is hard on the human psyche
p134
aVby every metric that we have.
p135
aVAs wealth goes up in a society,
p136
aVthe suicide rate goes up instead of down.
p137
aVIf you live in modern society,
p138
aVyou're up to eight times more likely
p139
aVto suffer from depression in your lifetime
p140
aVthan if you live in a poor, agrarian society.
p141
aVModern society has probably produced the highest rates of suicide
p142
aVand depression and anxiety and loneliness and child abuse
p143
aVever in human history.
p144
aVI saw one study
p145
aVthat compared women in Nigeria,
p146
aVone of the most chaotic and violent and corrupt
p147
aVand poorest countries in Africa,
p148
aVto women in North America.
p149
aVAnd the highest rates of depression were urban women in North America.
p150
aVThat was also the wealthiest group.
p151
aa(lp152
VSo let's go back to the US military.
p153
aVTen percent are in combat.
p154
aVAround 50 percent have filed for PTSD compensation.
p155
aVSo about 40 percent of veterans really were not traumatized overseas
p156
aVbut have come home to discover they are dangerously alienated
p157
aVand depressed.
p158
aVSo what is happening with them?
p159
aVWhat's going on with those people,
p160
aVthe phantom 40 percent that are troubled but don't understand why?
p161
aa(lp162
VMaybe it's this:
p163
aVmaybe they had an experience of sort of tribal closeness
p164
aVin their unit when they were overseas.
p165
aVThey were eating together, sleeping together,
p166
aVdoing tasks and missions together.
p167
aVThey were trusting each other with their lives.
p168
aVAnd then they come home
p169
aVand they have to give all that up
p170
aVand they're coming back to a society, a modern society,
p171
aVwhich is hard on people who weren't even in the military.
p172
aVIt's just hard on everybody.
p173
aa(lp174
VAnd we keep focusing on trauma, PTSD.
p175
aVBut for a lot of these people,
p176
aVmaybe it's not trauma.
p177
aVI mean, certainly, soldiers are traumatized
p178
aVand the ones who are have to be treated for that.
p179
aVBut a lot of them \u2014
p180
aVmaybe what's bothering them is actually a kind of alienation.
p181
aVI mean, maybe we just have the wrong word for some of it,
p182
aVand just changing our language, our understanding,
p183
aVwould help a little bit.
p184
aV"Post-deployment alienation disorder."
p185
aVMaybe even just calling it that for some of these people
p186
aVwould allow them to stop imagining
p187
aVtrying to imagine a trauma that didn't really happen
p188
aVin order to explain a feeling that really is happening.
p189
aVAnd in fact, it's an extremely dangerous feeling.
p190
aVThat alienation and depression can lead to suicide.
p191
aVThese people are in danger.
p192
aVIt's very important to understand why.
p193
aa(lp194
VThe Israeli military has a PTSD rate of around one percent.
p195
aVThe theory is that everyone in Israel is supposed to serve in the military.
p196
aVWhen soldiers come back from the front line,
p197
aVthey're not going from a military environment to a civilian environment.
p198
aVThey're coming back to a community where everyone understands
p199
aVabout the military.
p200
aVEveryone's been in it or is going to be in it.
p201
aVEveryone understands the situation they're all in.
p202
aVIt's as if they're all in one big tribe.
p203
aa(lp204
VWe know that if you take a lab rat
p205
aVand traumatize it and put it in a cage by itself,
p206
aVyou can maintain its trauma symptoms almost indefinitely.
p207
aVAnd if you take that same lab rat and put it in a cage with other rats,
p208
aVafter a couple of weeks, it's pretty much OK.
p209
aa(lp210
VAfter 9/11,
p211
aVthe murder rate in New York City went down by 40 percent.
p212
aVThe suicide rate went down.
p213
aVThe violent crime rate in New York went down after 9/11.
p214
aVEven combat veterans of previous wars who suffered from PTSD
p215
aVsaid that their symptoms went down after 9/11 happened.
p216
aVThe reason is that if you traumatize an entire society,
p217
aVwe don't fall apart and turn on one another.
p218
aVWe come together. We unify.
p219
aVBasically, we tribalize,
p220
aVand that process of unifying feels so good and is so good for us,
p221
aVthat it even helps people
p222
aVwho are struggling with mental health issues.
p223
aVDuring the blitz in London,
p224
aVadmissions to psychiatric wards went down during the bombings.
p225
aa(lp226
VFor a while, that was the kind of country
p227
aVthat American soldiers came back to \u2014 a unified country.
p228
aVWe were sticking together.
p229
aVWe were trying to understand the threat against us.
p230
aVWe were trying to help ourselves and the world.
p231
aVBut that's changed.
p232
aVNow, American soldiers,
p233
aVAmerican veterans are coming back to a country that is so bitterly divided
p234
aVthat the two political parties are literally accusing each other
p235
aVof treason, of being an enemy of the state,
p236
aVof trying to undermine the security and the welfare of their own country.
p237
aVThe gap between rich and poor is the biggest it's ever been.
p238
aVIt's just getting worse.
p239
aVRace relations are terrible.
p240
aVThere are demonstrations and even riots in the streets
p241
aVbecause of racial injustice.
p242
aVAnd veterans know that any tribe that treated itself that way \u2014 in fact,
p243
aVany platoon that treated itself that way \u2014 would never survive.
p244
aVWe've gotten used to it.
p245
aVVeterans have gone away and are coming back
p246
aVand seeing their own country with fresh eyes.
p247
aVAnd they see what's going on.
p248
aVThis is the country they fought for.
p249
aVNo wonder they're depressed.
p250
aVNo wonder they're scared.
p251
aa(lp252
VSometimes, we ask ourselves if we can save the vets.
p253
aVI think the real question is if we can save ourselves.
p254
aVIf we can,
p255
aVI think the vets are going to be fine.
p256
aVIt's time for this country to unite,
p257
aVif only to help the men and women who fought to protect us.
p258
