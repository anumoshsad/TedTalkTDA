VThe day I left home for the first time
p4
aVto go to university was a bright day
p5
aVbrimming with hope and optimism.
p6
aVI'd done well at school. Expectations for me were high,
p7
aVand I gleefully entered the student life
p8
aVof lectures, parties and traffic cone theft.
p9
aVNow appearances, of course, can be deceptive,
p10
aVand to an extent, this feisty, energetic persona
p11
aVof lecture-going and traffic cone stealing was a veneer,
p12
aValbeit a very well-crafted and convincing one.
p13
aVUnderneath, I was actually deeply unhappy, insecure
p14
aVand fundamentally frightened \u2014
p15
aVfrightened of other people, of the future, of failure
p16
aVand of the emptiness that I felt was within me.
p17
aVBut I was skilled at hiding it, and from the outside
p18
aVappeared to be someone with everything to hope for
p19
aVand aspire to.
p20
aVThis fantasy of invulnerability was so complete
p21
aVthat I even deceived myself,
p22
aVand as the first semester ended and the second began,
p23
aVthere was no way that anyone could have predicted
p24
aVwhat was just about to happen.
p25
aVI was leaving a seminar when it started,
p26
aVhumming to myself, fumbling with my bag
p27
aVjust as I'd done a hundred times before,
p28
aVwhen suddenly I heard a voice calmly observe,
p29
aV"She is leaving the room."
p30
aVI looked around, and there was no one there,
p31
aVbut the clarity and decisiveness of the comment
p32
aVwas unmistakable.
p33
aVShaken, I left my books on the stairs and hurried home,
p34
aVand there it was again.
p35
aV"She is opening the door."
p36
aVThis was the beginning. The voice had arrived.
p37
aVAnd the voice persisted,
p38
aVdays and then weeks of it, on and on,
p39
aVnarrating everything I did in the third person.
p40
aV"She is going to the library."
p41
aV"She is going to a lecture."
p42
aVIt was neutral, impassive and even, after a while,
p43
aVstrangely companionate and reassuring,
p44
aValthough I did notice that its calm exterior sometimes slipped
p45
aVand that it occasionally mirrored my own unexpressed emotion.
p46
aVSo, for example, if I was angry and had to hide it,
p47
aVwhich I often did, being very adept at concealing how I really felt,
p48
aVthen the voice would sound frustrated.
p49
aVOtherwise, it was neither sinister nor disturbing,
p50
aValthough even at that point it was clear
p51
aVthat it had something to communicate to me
p52
aVabout my emotions, particularly emotions
p53
aVwhich were remote and inaccessible.
p54
aVNow it was then that I made a fatal mistake,
p55
aVin that I told a friend about the voice, and she was horrified.
p56
aVA subtle conditioning process had begun,
p57
aVthe implication that normal people don't hear voices
p58
aVand the fact that I did meant that something was very seriously wrong.
p59
aVSuch fear and mistrust was infectious.
p60
aVSuddenly the voice didn't seem quite so benign anymore,
p61
aVand when she insisted that I seek medical attention,
p62
aVI duly complied, and which proved to be
p63
aVmistake number two.
p64
aVI spent some time telling the college G.P.
p65
aVabout what I perceived to be the real problem:
p66
aVanxiety, low self-worth, fears about the future,
p67
aVand was met with bored indifference
p68
aVuntil I mentioned the voice,
p69
aVupon which he dropped his pen, swung round
p70
aVand began to question me with a show of real interest.
p71
aVAnd to be fair, I was desperate for interest and help,
p72
aVand I began to tell him about my strange commentator.
p73
aVAnd I always wish, at this point, the voice had said,
p74
aV"She is digging her own grave."
p75
aVI was referred to a psychiatrist, who likewise
p76
aVtook a grim view of the voice's presence,
p77
aVsubsequently interpreting everything I said
p78
aVthrough a lens of latent insanity.
p79
aVFor example, I was part of a student TV station
p80
aVthat broadcast news bulletins around the campus,
p81
aVand during an appointment which was running very late,
p82
aVI said, "I'm sorry, doctor, I've got to go.
p83
aVI'm reading the news at six."
p84
aVNow it's down on my medical records that Eleanor
p85
aVhas delusions that she's a television news broadcaster.
p86
aVIt was at this point that events began
p87
aVto rapidly overtake me.
p88
aVA hospital admission followed, the first of many,
p89
aVa diagnosis of schizophrenia came next,
p90
aVand then, worst of all, a toxic, tormenting sense
p91
aVof hopelessness, humiliation and despair
p92
aVabout myself and my prospects.
p93
aVBut having been encouraged to see the voice
p94
aVnot as an experience but as a symptom,
p95
aVmy fear and resistance towards it intensified.
p96
aVNow essentially, this represented taking
p97
aVan aggressive stance towards my own mind,
p98
aVa kind of psychic civil war,
p99
aVand in turn this caused the number of voices to increase
p100
aVand grow progressively hostile and menacing.
p101
aVHelplessly and hopelessly, I began to retreat
p102
aVinto this nightmarish inner world
p103
aVin which the voices were destined to become
p104
aVboth my persecutors and my only perceived companions.
p105
aVThey told me, for example, that if I proved myself worthy
p106
aVof their help, then they could change my life
p107
aVback to how it had been,
p108
aVand a series of increasingly bizarre tasks was set,
p109
aVa kind of labor of Hercules.
p110
aVIt started off quite small, for example,
p111
aVpull out three strands of hair,
p112
aVbut gradually it grew more extreme,
p113
aVculminating in commands to harm myself,
p114
aVand a particularly dramatic instruction:
p115
aV"You see that tutor over there?
p116
aVYou see that glass of water?
p117
aVWell, you have to go over and pour it over him in front of the other students."
p118
aVWhich I actually did, and which needless to say
p119
aVdid not endear me to the faculty.
p120
aVIn effect, a vicious cycle of fear, avoidance,
p121
aVmistrust and misunderstanding had been established,
p122
aVand this was a battle in which I felt powerless
p123
aVand incapable of establishing any kind of peace or reconciliation.
p124
aVTwo years later, and the deterioration was dramatic.
p125
aVBy now, I had the whole frenzied repertoire:
p126
aVterrifying voices, grotesque visions,
p127
aVbizarre, intractable delusions.
p128
aVMy mental health status had been a catalyst
p129
aVfor discrimination, verbal abuse,
p130
aVand physical and sexual assault,
p131
aVand I'd been told by my psychiatrist,
p132
aV"Eleanor, you'd be better off with cancer,
p133
aVbecause cancer is easier to cure than schizophrenia."
p134
aVI'd been diagnosed, drugged and discarded,
p135
aVand was by now so tormented by the voices
p136
aVthat I attempted to drill a hole in my head
p137
aVin order to get them out.
p138
aVNow looking back on the wreckage and despair of those years,
p139
aVit seems to me now as if someone died in that place,
p140
aVand yet, someone else was saved.
p141
aVA broken and haunted person began that journey,
p142
aVbut the person who emerged was a survivor
p143
aVand would ultimately grow into the person
p144
aVI was destined to be.
p145
aVMany people have harmed me in my life,
p146
aVand I remember them all,
p147
aVbut the memories grow pale and faint
p148
aVin comparison with the people who've helped me.
p149
aVThe fellow survivors, the fellow voice-hearers,
p150
aVthe comrades and collaborators;
p151
aVthe mother who never gave up on me,
p152
aVwho knew that one day I would come back to her
p153
aVand was willing to wait for me for as long as it took;
p154
aVthe doctor who only worked with me for a brief time
p155
aVbut who reinforced his belief that recovery
p156
aVwas not only possible but inevitable,
p157
aVand during a devastating period of relapse
p158
aVtold my terrified family, "Don't give up hope.
p159
aVI believe that Eleanor can get through this.
p160
aVSometimes, you know, it snows as late as May,
p161
aVbut summer always comes eventually."
p162
aVFourteen minutes is not enough time
p163
aVto fully credit those good and generous people
p164
aVwho fought with me and for me
p165
aVand who waited to welcome me back
p166
aVfrom that agonized, lonely place.
p167
aVBut together, they forged a blend of courage,
p168
aVcreativity, integrity, and an unshakeable belief
p169
aVthat my shattered self could become healed and whole.
p170
aVI used to say that these people saved me,
p171
aVbut what I now know is they did something
p172
aVeven more important in that they empowered me
p173
aVto save myself,
p174
aVand crucially, they helped me to understand something
p175
aVwhich I'd always suspected:
p176
aVthat my voices were a meaningful response
p177
aVto traumatic life events, particularly childhood events,
p178
aVand as such were not my enemies
p179
aVbut a source of insight into solvable emotional problems.
p180
aVNow, at first, this was very difficult to believe,
p181
aVnot least because the voices appeared so hostile
p182
aVand menacing, so in this respect, a vital first step
p183
aVwas learning to separate out a metaphorical meaning
p184
aVfrom what I'd previously interpreted to be a literal truth.
p185
aVSo for example, voices which threatened to attack my home
p186
aVI learned to interpret as my own sense of fear
p187
aVand insecurity in the world, rather than an actual, objective danger.
p188
aVNow at first, I would have believed them.
p189
aVI remember, for example, sitting up one night
p190
aVon guard outside my parents' room to protect them
p191
aVfrom what I thought was a genuine threat from the voices.
p192
aVBecause I'd had such a bad problem with self-injury
p193
aVthat most of the cutlery in the house had been hidden,
p194
aVso I ended up arming myself with a plastic fork,
p195
aVkind of like picnic ware, and sort of sat outside the room
p196
aVclutching it and waiting to spring into action should anything happen.
p197
aVIt was like, "Don't mess with me.
p198
aVI've got a plastic fork, don't you know?"
p199
aVStrategic.
p200
aVBut a later response, and much more useful,
p201
aVwould be to try and deconstruct the message behind the words,
p202
aVso when the voices warned me not to leave the house,
p203
aVthen I would thank them for drawing my attention
p204
aVto how unsafe I felt \u2014
p205
aVbecause if I was aware of it, then I could do something positive about it \u2014
p206
aVbut go on to reassure both them and myself
p207
aVthat we were safe and didn't need to feel frightened anymore.
p208
aVI would set boundaries for the voices,
p209
aVand try to interact with them in a way that was assertive
p210
aVyet respectful, establishing a slow process
p211
aVof communication and collaboration
p212
aVin which we could learn to work together and support one another.
p213
aVThroughout all of this, what I would ultimately realize
p214
aVwas that each voice was closely related
p215
aVto aspects of myself, and that each of them
p216
aVcarried overwhelming emotions that I'd never had
p217
aVan opportunity to process or resolve,
p218
aVmemories of sexual trauma and abuse,
p219
aVof anger, shame, guilt, low self-worth.
p220
aVThe voices took the place of this pain
p221
aVand gave words to it,
p222
aVand possibly one of the greatest revelations
p223
aVwas when I realized that the most hostile and aggressive voices
p224
aVactually represented the parts of me
p225
aVthat had been hurt most profoundly,
p226
aVand as such, it was these voices
p227
aVthat needed to be shown the greatest compassion and care.
p228
aVIt was armed with this knowledge that ultimately
p229
aVI would gather together my shattered self,
p230
aVeach fragment represented by a different voice,
p231
aVgradually withdraw from all my medication,
p232
aVand return to psychiatry, only this time from the other side.
p233
aVTen years after the voice first came, I finally graduated,
p234
aVthis time with the highest degree in psychology
p235
aVthe university had ever given, and one year later,
p236
aVthe highest masters, which shall we say
p237
aVisn't bad for a madwoman.
p238
aVIn fact, one of the voices actually dictated the answers
p239
aVduring the exam, which technically possibly counts as cheating.
p240
aV(Laughter)
p241
aVAnd to be honest, sometimes I quite enjoyed their attention as well.
p242
aVAs Oscar Wilde has said, the only thing worse
p243
aVthan being talked about is not being talked about.
p244
aVIt also makes you very good at eavesdropping,
p245
aVbecause you can listen to two conversations simultaneously.
p246
aVSo it's not all bad.
p247
aVI worked in mental health services,
p248
aVI spoke at conferences,
p249
aVI published book chapters and academic articles,
p250
aVand I argued, and continue to do so,
p251
aVthe relevance of the following concept:
p252
aVthat an important question in psychiatry
p253
aVshouldn't be what's wrong with you
p254
aVbut rather what's happened to you.
p255
aVAnd all the while, I listened to my voices,
p256
aVwith whom I'd finally learned to live with peace and respect
p257
aVand which in turn reflected a growing sense
p258
aVof compassion, acceptance and respect towards myself.
p259
aVAnd I remember the most moving and extraordinary moment
p260
aVwhen supporting another young woman who was terrorized by her voices,
p261
aVand becoming fully aware, for the very first time,
p262
aVthat I no longer felt that way myself
p263
aVbut was finally able to help someone else who was.
p264
aVI'm now very proud to be a part of Intervoice,
p265
aVthe organizational body of the International Hearing Voices Movement,
p266
aVan initiative inspired by the work of Professor Marius Romme
p267
aVand Dr. Sandra Escher,
p268
aVwhich locates voice hearing as a survival strategy,
p269
aVa sane reaction to insane circumstances,
p270
aVnot as an aberrant symptom of schizophrenia to be endured,
p271
aVbut a complex, significant and meaningful experience
p272
aVto be explored.
p273
aVTogether, we envisage and enact a society
p274
aVthat understands and respects voice hearing,
p275
aVsupports the needs of individuals who hear voices,
p276
aVand which values them as full citizens.
p277
aVThis type of society is not only possible,
p278
aVit's already on its way.
p279
aVTo paraphrase Chavez, once social change begins,
p280
aVit cannot be reversed.
p281
aVYou cannot humiliate the person who feels pride.
p282
aVYou cannot oppress the people
p283
aVwho are not afraid anymore.
p284
aVFor me, the achievements of the Hearing Voices Movement
p285
aVare a reminder that empathy, fellowship,
p286
aVjustice and respect are more than words;
p287
aVthey are convictions and beliefs,
p288
aVand that beliefs can change the world.
p289
aVIn the last 20 years, the Hearing Voices Movement
p290
aVhas established hearing voices networks
p291
aVin 26 countries across five continents,
p292
aVworking together to promote dignity, solidarity
p293
aVand empowerment for individuals in mental distress,
p294
aVto create a new language and practice of hope,
p295
aVwhich, at its very center, lies an unshakable belief
p296
aVin the power of the individual.
p297
aVAs Peter Levine has said, the human animal
p298
aVis a unique being
p299
aVendowed with an instinctual capacity to heal
p300
aVand the intellectual spirit to harness this innate capacity.
p301
aVIn this respect, for members of society,
p302
aVthere is no greater honor or privilege
p303
aVthan facilitating that process of healing for someone,
p304
aVto bear witness, to reach out a hand,
p305
aVto share the burden of someone's suffering,
p306
aVand to hold the hope for their recovery.
p307
aVAnd likewise, for survivors of distress and adversity,
p308
aVthat we remember we don't have to live our lives
p309
aVforever defined by the damaging things that have happened to us.
p310
aVWe are unique. We are irreplaceable.
p311
aVWhat lies within us can never be truly colonized,
p312
aVcontorted, or taken away.
p313
aVThe light never goes out.
p314
aVAs a very wonderful doctor once said to me,
p315
aV"Don't tell me what other people have told you about yourself.
p316
aVTell me about you."
p317
aVThank you.
