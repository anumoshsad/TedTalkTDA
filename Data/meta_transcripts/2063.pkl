VThese are simple objects:
p4
aVclocks, keys, combs, glasses.
p5
aVThey are the things the victims of genocide in Bosnia
p6
aVcarried with them on their final journey.
p7
aVWe are all familiar with these mundane,
p8
aVeveryday objects.
p9
aVThe fact that some of the victims carried
p10
aVpersonal items such as toothpaste and a toothbrush
p11
aVis a clear sign they had no idea
p12
aVwhat was about to happen to them.
p13
aVUsually, they were told that they were going to be
p14
aVexchanged for prisoners of war.
p15
aa(lp16
VThese items have been recovered
p17
aVfrom numerous mass graves across my homeland,
p18
aVand as we speak, forensics are exhuming bodies
p19
aVfrom newly discovered mass graves,
p20
aV20 years after the war.
p21
aVAnd it is quite possibly the largest ever discovered.
p22
aVDuring the four years of conflict
p23
aVthat devastated the Bosnian nation in the early '90s,
p24
aVapproximately 30,000 citizens, mainly civilians,
p25
aVwent missing, presumed killed,
p26
aVand another 100,000 were killed
p27
aVduring combat operations.
p28
aVMost of them were killed
p29
aVeither in the early days of the war
p30
aVor towards the end of the hostilities,
p31
aVwhen U.N. safe zones like Srebrenica
p32
aVfell into the hands of the Serb army.
p33
aa(lp34
VThe international criminal tribunal
p35
aVdelivered a number of sentences
p36
aVfor crimes against humanity and genocide.
p37
aVGenocide is a systematic and deliberate
p38
aVdestruction of a racial, political, religious
p39
aVor ethnic group.
p40
aVAs much as genocide is about killing.
p41
aVIt is also about destroying their property,
p42
aVtheir cultural heritage,
p43
aVand ultimately the very notion that they ever existed.
p44
aVGenocide is not only about the killing;
p45
aVit is about the denied identity.
p46
aVThere are always traces \u2014
p47
aVno such thing as a perfect crime.
p48
aVThere are always remnants of the perished ones
p49
aVthat are more durable than their fragile bodies
p50
aVand our selective and fading memory of them.
p51
aa(lp52
VThese items are recovered
p53
aVfrom numerous mass graves,
p54
aVand the main goal of this collection of the items
p55
aVis a unique process
p56
aVof identifying those who disappeared in the killings,
p57
aVthe first act of genocide on European soil
p58
aVsince the Holocaust.
p59
aVNot a single body should remain undiscovered
p60
aVor unidentified.
p61
aVOnce recovered,
p62
aVthese items that the victims carried with them
p63
aVon their way to execution
p64
aVare carefully cleaned, analyzed,
p65
aVcatalogued and stored.
p66
aVThousands of artifacts are packed in white plastic bags
p67
aVjust like the ones you see on CSI.
p68
aVThese objects are used as a forensic tool
p69
aVin visual identification of the victims,
p70
aVbut they are also used as very valuable forensic evidence
p71
aVin the ongoing war crimes trials.
p72
aVSurvivors are occasionally called
p73
aVto try to identify these items physically,
p74
aVbut physical browsing is extremely difficult,
p75
aVan ineffective and painful process.
p76
aVOnce the forensics and doctors and lawyers
p77
aVare done with these objects,
p78
aVthey become orphans of the narrative.
p79
aVMany of them get destroyed, believe it or not,
p80
aVor they get simply shelved,
p81
aVout of sight and out of mind.
p82
aa(lp83
VI decided a few years ago
p84
aVto photograph every single exhumed item
p85
aVin order to create a visual archive
p86
aVthat survivors could easily browse.
p87
aVAs a storyteller, I like to give back to the community.
p88
aVI like to move beyond raising awareness.
p89
aVAnd in this case, someone may
p90
aVrecognize these items
p91
aVor at least their photographs will remain
p92
aVas a permanent, unbiased and accurate reminder
p93
aVof what happened.
p94
aVPhotography is about empathy,
p95
aVand the familiarity of these items guarantee empathy.
p96
aVIn this case, I am merely a tool,
p97
aVa forensic, if you like,
p98
aVand the result is a photography that is as close
p99
aVas possible of being a document.
p100
aa(lp101
VOnce all the missing persons are identified,
p102
aVonly decaying bodies in their graves
p103
aVand these everyday items will remain.
p104
aVIn all their simplicity,
p105
aVthese items are the last testament
p106
aVto the identity of the victims,
p107
aVthe last permanent reminder
p108
aVthat these people ever existed.
