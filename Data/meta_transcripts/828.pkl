VFirst of all, I'm a geek.
p4
aVI'm an organic food-eating,
p5
aVcarbon footprint-minimizing, robotic surgery geek.
p6
aVAnd I really want to build green,
p7
aVbut I'm very suspicious
p8
aVof all of these well-meaning articles,
p9
aVpeople long on moral authority
p10
aVand short on data,
p11
aVtelling me how to do these kinds of things.
p12
aVAnd so I have to figure this out for myself.
p13
aVFor example: Is this evil?
p14
aVI have dropped a blob of organic yogurt
p15
aVfrom happy self-actualized local cows
p16
aVon my counter top,
p17
aVand I grab a paper towel and I want to wipe it up.
p18
aVBut can I use a paper towel? (Laughter)
p19
aa(lp20
VThe answer to this can be found in embodied energy.
p21
aVThis is the amount of energy that goes into
p22
aVany paper towel or embodied water,
p23
aVand every time I use a paper towel,
p24
aVI am using this much
p25
aVvirtual energy and water.
p26
aVWipe it up, throw it away.
p27
aVNow, if I compare that to a cotton towel
p28
aVthat I can use a thousand times,
p29
aVI don't have a whole lot of embodied energy
p30
aVuntil I wash that yogurty towel.
p31
aVThis is now operating energy.
p32
aVSo if I throw my towel in the washing machine,
p33
aVI've now put energy and water
p34
aVback into that towel ...
p35
aVunless I use a front-loading, high-efficiency washing machine, (Laughter)
p36
aVand then it looks a little bit better.
p37
aVBut what about a recycled paper towel
p38
aVthat comes in those little half sheets?
p39
aVWell, now a paper towel looks better.
p40
aVScrew the paper towels. Let's go to a sponge.
p41
aVI wipe it up with a sponge, and I put it under the running water,
p42
aVand I have a lot less energy and a lot more water.
p43
aVUnless you're like me and you leave the handle
p44
aVin the position of hot even when you turn it on,
p45
aVand then you start to use more energy.
p46
aVOr worse, you let it run until it's warm
p47
aVto rinse out your towel.
p48
aVAnd now all bets are off.
p49
aa(lp50
V(Laughter)
p51
aa(lp52
VSo what this says is that
p53
aVsometimes the things that you least expect \u2014
p54
aVthe position in which you put the handle \u2014
p55
aVhave a bigger effect than any of those other things
p56
aVthat you were trying to optimize.
p57
aVNow imagine someone as twisted as me
p58
aVtrying to build a house.
p59
aV(Laughter)
p60
aVThat's what my husband and I are doing right now.
p61
aVAnd so, we wanted to know, how green could we be?
p62
aVAnd there's a thousand and one articles out there
p63
aVtelling us how to make all these green trade-offs.
p64
aVAnd they are just as suspect
p65
aVin telling us to optimize these little things around the edges
p66
aVand missing the elephant in the living room.
p67
aVNow, the average house
p68
aVhas about 300 megawatt hours
p69
aVof embodied energy in it;
p70
aVthis is the energy it takes to make it \u2014
p71
aVmillions and millions of paper towels.
p72
aa(lp73
VWe wanted to know how much better we could do.
p74
aVAnd so, like many people,
p75
aVwe start with a house on a lot,
p76
aVand I'm going to show you a typical construction on the top
p77
aVand what we're doing on the bottom.
p78
aVSo first, we demolish it.
p79
aVIt takes some energy, but if you deconstruct it \u2014
p80
aVyou take it all apart, you use the bits \u2014
p81
aVyou can get some of that energy back.
p82
aVWe then dug a big hole
p83
aVto put in a rainwater catchment tank
p84
aVto take our yard water independent.
p85
aVAnd then we poured a big foundation
p86
aVfor passive solar.
p87
aVNow, you can reduce the embodied energy
p88
aVby about 25 percent
p89
aVby using high fly ash concrete.
p90
aVWe then put in framing.
p91
aVAnd so this is framing \u2014 lumber,
p92
aVcomposite materials \u2014
p93
aVand it's kind of hard to get the embodied energy out of that,
p94
aVbut it can be a sustainable resource
p95
aVif you use FSC-certified lumber.
p96
aa(lp97
VWe then go on to
p98
aVthe first thing that was very surprising.
p99
aVIf we put aluminum windows in this house,
p100
aVwe would double the energy use right there.
p101
aVNow, PVC is a little bit better,
p102
aVbut still not as good as the wood that we chose.
p103
aVWe then put in plumbing,
p104
aVelectrical and HVAC,
p105
aVand insulate.
p106
aVNow, spray foam is an excellent insulator \u2014 it fills in all the cracks \u2014
p107
aVbut it is pretty high embodied energy,
p108
aVand, sprayed-in cellulose or blue jeans
p109
aVis a much lower energy alternative to that.
p110
aVWe also used straw bale
p111
aVinfill for our library,
p112
aVwhich has zero embodied energy.
p113
aVWhen it comes time to sheetrock,
p114
aVif you use EcoRock it's about a quarter
p115
aVof the embodied energy of standard sheetrock.
p116
aa(lp117
VAnd then you get to the finishes,
p118
aVthe subject of all of those "go green" articles,
p119
aVand on the scale of a house
p120
aVthey almost make no difference at all.
p121
aVAnd yet, all the press is focused on that.
p122
aVExcept for flooring.
p123
aVIf you put carpeting in your house,
p124
aVit's about a tenth of the embodied energy of the entire house,
p125
aVunless you use concrete or wood
p126
aVfor a much lower embodied energy.
p127
aVSo now we add in the final construction energy, we add it all up,
p128
aVand we've built a house for less than half
p129
aVof the typical embodied energy for building a house like this.
p130
aa(lp131
VBut before we pat ourselves
p132
aVtoo much on the back,
p133
aVwe have poured 151 megawatt hours
p134
aVof energy into constructing this house
p135
aVwhen there was a house there before.
p136
aVAnd so the question is:
p137
aVHow could we make that back?
p138
aVAnd so if I run my new energy-efficient house forward,
p139
aVcompared with the old, non-energy-efficient house,
p140
aVwe make it back in about six years.
p141
aVNow, I probably would have upgraded the old house
p142
aVto be more energy-efficient,
p143
aVand in that case,
p144
aVit would take me more about 20 years to break even.
p145
aVNow, if I hadn't paid attention to embodied energy,
p146
aVit would have taken us
p147
aVover 50 years to break even
p148
aVcompared to the upgraded house.
p149
aVSo what does this mean?
p150
aVOn the scale of my portion of the house,
p151
aVthis is equivalent to about
p152
aVas much as I drive in a year,
p153
aVit's about five times as much
p154
aVas if I went entirely vegetarian.
p155
aVBut my elephant in the living room flies.
p156
aVClearly, I need to walk home from TED.
p157
aVBut all the calculations
p158
aVfor embodied energy are on the blog.
p159
aa(lp160
VAnd, remember, it's sometimes the things that you are not expecting
p161
aVto be the biggest changes that are.
