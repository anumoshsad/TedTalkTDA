VIn Kenya, 1984 is known
p4
aVas the year of the cup,
p5
aVor the goro goro.
p6
aVThe goro goro is a cup used to measure
p7
aVtwo kilograms of maize flower on the market,
p8
aVand the maize flower is used to make ugali,
p9
aVa polenta-like cake that is eaten together with vegetables.
p10
aVBoth the maize and the vegetables are grown
p11
aVon most Kenyan farms,
p12
aVwhich means that most families can feed themselves
p13
aVfrom their own farm.
p14
aVOne goro goro can feed three meals
p15
aVfor an average family,
p16
aVand in 1984, the whole harvest
p17
aVcould fit in one goro goro.
p18
aVIt was and still is one of the worst droughts
p19
aVin living memory.
p20
aVNow today, I insure farmers against droughts
p21
aVlike those in the year of the cup,
p22
aVor to be more specific, I insure the rains.
p23
aa(lp24
VI come from a family of missionaries
p25
aVwho built hospitals in Indonesia,
p26
aVand my father built a psychiatric hospital
p27
aVin Tanzania.
p28
aVThis is me, age five, in front of that hospital.
p29
aVI don't think they thought I'd grow up
p30
aVto sell insurance. (Laughter)
p31
aVSo let me tell you how that happened.
p32
aa(lp33
VIn 2008, I was working
p34
aVfor the Ministry of Agriculture of Rwanda,
p35
aVand my boss had just been promoted
p36
aVto become the minister.
p37
aVShe launched an ambitious plan
p38
aVto start a green revolution in her country,
p39
aVand before we knew it, we were importing
p40
aVtons of fertilizer and seed
p41
aVand telling farmers how to apply that fertilizer
p42
aVand plant.
p43
aVA couple of weeks later,
p44
aVthe International Monetary Fund visited us,
p45
aVand asked my minister,
p46
aV"Minister, it's great that you want to help farmers
p47
aVreach food security, but what if it doesn't rain?"
p48
aVMy minister answered proudly
p49
aVand somewhat defiantly,
p50
aV"I am going to pray for rain."
p51
aVThat ended the discussion.
p52
aVOn the way back to the ministry in the car,
p53
aVshe turned around to me and said,
p54
aV"Rose, you've always been interested in finance.
p55
aVGo find us some insurance."
p56
aa(lp57
VIt's been six years since,
p58
aVand last year I was fortunate enough
p59
aVto be part of a team that insured
p60
aVover 185,000 farmers in Kenya and Rwanda
p61
aVagainst drought.
p62
aVThey owned an average of half an acre
p63
aVand paid on average two Euros in premium.
p64
aVIt's microinsurance.
p65
aa(lp66
VNow, traditional insurance doesn't work
p67
aVwith two to three Euros of premium,
p68
aVbecause traditional insurance relies on farm visits.
p69
aVA farmer here in Germany would be visited
p70
aVfor the start of the season, halfway through,
p71
aVand at the end, and again if there was a loss,
p72
aVto estimate the damages.
p73
aVFor a small-scale farmer in the middle of Africa,
p74
aVthe maths of doing those visits
p75
aVsimply don't add up.
p76
aVSo instead, we rely on technology and data.
p77
aVThis satellite measures
p78
aVwhether there were clouds or not,
p79
aVbecause think about it:
p80
aVIf there are clouds, then you might have some rain,
p81
aVbut if there are no clouds,
p82
aVthen it's actually impossible for it to rain.
p83
aVThese images show the onset of the rains
p84
aVthis season in Kenya.
p85
aVYou see that around March 6,
p86
aVthe clouds move in and then disappear,
p87
aVand then around the March 11,
p88
aVthe clouds really move in.
p89
aVThat, and those clouds,
p90
aVwere the onset of the rains this year.
p91
aVThis satellite covers the whole of Africa
p92
aVand goes back as far as 1984,
p93
aVand that's important, because if you know
p94
aVhow many times a place has had a drought
p95
aVin the last 30 years,
p96
aVyou can make a pretty good estimate
p97
aVwhat the chances are of drought in the future,
p98
aVand that means that you can put a price tag
p99
aVon the risk of drought.
p100
aa(lp101
VThe data alone isn't enough.
p102
aVWe devise agronomic algorithms
p103
aVwhich tell us how much rainfall a crop needs and when.
p104
aVFor example, for maize at planting,
p105
aVyou need to have two days of rain
p106
aVfor farmers to plant,
p107
aVand then it needs to rain once every two weeks
p108
aVfor the crop to properly germinate.
p109
aVAfter that, you need rain every three weeks
p110
aVfor the crop to form its leaves,
p111
aVwhereas at flowering, you need it to rain more frequently,
p112
aVabout once every 10 days for the crop to form its cob.
p113
aVAt the end of the season,
p114
aVyou actually don't want it to rain,
p115
aVbecause rains then can damage the crop.
p116
aa(lp117
VDevising such a cover is difficult,
p118
aVbut it turned out the real challenge
p119
aVwas selling insurance.
p120
aVWe set ourselves a modest target
p121
aVof 500 farmers insured after our first season.
p122
aVAfter a couple of months' intense marketing,
p123
aVwe had signed up the grand total
p124
aVof 185 farmers.
p125
aVI was disappointed and confounded.
p126
aVEverybody kept telling me that farmers
p127
aVwanted insurance,
p128
aVbut our prime customers simply weren't buying.
p129
aVThey were waiting to see what would happen,
p130
aVdidn't trust insurance companies,
p131
aVor thought, "I've managed for so many years.
p132
aVWhy would I buy insurance now?"
p133
aa(lp134
VNow many of you know microcredit,
p135
aVthe method of providing small loans to poor people
p136
aVpioneered by Muhammad Yunus,
p137
aVwho won the Nobel Peace Prize
p138
aVfor his work with the Grameen Bank.
p139
aVTurns out, selling microcredit
p140
aVisn't the same as selling insurance.
p141
aVFor credit, a farmer needs to earn the trust of a bank,
p142
aVand if it succeeds, the bank will advance him money.
p143
aVThat's an attractive proposition.
p144
aVFor insurance, the farmer needs to trust
p145
aVthe insurance company, and needs
p146
aVto advance the insurance company money.
p147
aVIt's a very different value proposition.
p148
aVAnd so the uptick of insurance has been slow,
p149
aVwith so far only 4.4 percent of Africans
p150
aVtaking up insurance in 2012,
p151
aVand half of that number is in one country,
p152
aVSouth Africa.
p153
aa(lp154
VWe tried for some years
p155
aVselling insurance directly to farmers,
p156
aVwith very high marketing cost
p157
aVand very limited success.
p158
aVThen we realized that there were many organizations
p159
aVworking with farmers:
p160
aVseed companies, microfinance institutions,
p161
aVmobile phone companies,
p162
aVgovernment agencies.
p163
aVThey were all providing loans to farmers,
p164
aVand often, just before they'd finalize the loan,
p165
aVthe farmer would say,
p166
aV"But what if it doesn't rain?
p167
aVHow do you expect me to repay my loan?"
p168
aVMany of these organizations
p169
aVwere taking on the risk themselves,
p170
aVsimply hoping that that year,
p171
aVthe worst wouldn't happen.
p172
aVMost of the organizations, however,
p173
aVwere limiting their growth in agriculture.
p174
aVThey couldn't take on this kind of risk.
p175
aVThese organizations became our customers,
p176
aVand when combining credit and insurance,
p177
aVinteresting things can happen.
p178
aVLet me tell you one more story.
p179
aa(lp180
VAt the start of February 2012 in western Kenya,
p181
aVthe rains started, and they started early,
p182
aVand when rains start early, farmers are encouraged,
p183
aVbecause it usually means that the season is going to be good.
p184
aVSo they took out loans and planted.
p185
aVFor the next three weeks,
p186
aVthere wasn't a single drop of rain,
p187
aVand the crops that had germinated so well
p188
aVshriveled and died.
p189
aVWe'd insured the loans of a microfinance institution
p190
aVthat had provided those loans
p191
aVto about 6,000 farmers in that area,
p192
aVand we called them up and said,
p193
aV"Look, we know about the drought.
p194
aVWe've got you.
p195
aVWe'll give you 200,000 Euros at the end of the season."
p196
aVThey said, "Wow, that's great,
p197
aVbut that'll be late.
p198
aVCould you give us the money now?
p199
aVThen these farmers can still replant
p200
aVand can get a harvest this season."
p201
aVSo we convinced our insurance partners,
p202
aVand later that April, these farmers replanted.
p203
aVWe took the idea of replanting to a seed company
p204
aVand convinced them to price the cost of insurance
p205
aVinto every bag of seed,
p206
aVand in every bag, we packed a card
p207
aVthat had a number on it,
p208
aVand when the farmers would open the card,
p209
aVthey'd text in that number,
p210
aVand that number would actually help us
p211
aVto locate the farmer
p212
aVand allocate them to a satellite pixel.
p213
aVA satellite would then measure the rainfall
p214
aVfor the next three weeks,
p215
aVand if it didn't rain,
p216
aVwe'd replace their seed.
p217
aa(lp218
VOne of the first \u2014
p219
aV(Applause) \u2014 Hold on, I'm not there!
p220
aa(lp221
VOne of the first beneficiaries of this replanting guarantee
p222
aVwas Bosco Mwinyi.
p223
aVWe visited his farm later that August,
p224
aVand I wish I could show you the smile on his face
p225
aVwhen he showed us his harvest,
p226
aVbecause it warmed my heart
p227
aVand it made me realize why selling insurance
p228
aVcan be a good thing.
p229
aVBut you know, he insisted
p230
aVthat we get his whole harvest in the picture,
p231
aVso we had to zoom out a lot.
p232
aVInsurance secured his harvest that season,
p233
aVand I believe that today,
p234
aVwe have all the tools to enable African farmers
p235
aVto take control of their own destiny.
p236
aVNo more years of the cup.
p237
aVInstead, I am looking forward to, at least somehow,
p238
aVthe year of the insurance,
p239
aVor the year of the great harvest.
p240
