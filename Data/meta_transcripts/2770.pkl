VGayle King: Have a seat, Serena Williams,
p4
aVor should we say, have a seat, mom.
p5
aa(lp6
V(Cheers)
p7
aa(lp8
VSo no doubt, you guys are like me.
p9
aVYou saw the release of Serena
p10
aVin that great yellow bathing suit last week
p11
aVand when I saw it, all I could think of was,
p12
aV"Gosh, why couldn't she have waited til we sat onstage for TED?"
p13
aVI was very selfish, I know.
p14
aVSo I asked you about that picture,
p15
aVand you said nobody was supposed to see that picture.
p16
aVWhat do you mean?
p17
aa(lp18
VSerena Williams: Well, actually, it was an accident.
p19
aVI was on vacation, just taking some time for myself,
p20
aVand I have this thing where I've been checking my status
p21
aVand taking pictures every week to see how far along I'm going \u2014
p22
aa(lp23
VGK: And sharing it with friends, maybe?
p24
aa(lp25
VSW: No, actually I have just been saving it,
p26
aVand I didn't really tell a lot of people,
p27
aVto be quite honest,
p28
aVand I'd been saving it,
p29
aVand you know how social media is, you press the wrong button and \u2014
p30
aa(lp31
V(Laughter)
p32
aa(lp33
VGK: And there it was.
p34
aa(lp35
VSW: So 30 minutes later \u2014 my phone doesn't ring that much \u2014
p36
aVand 30 minutes later, I missed like four calls,
p37
aVand I'm like, that's weird,
p38
aVand then I picked it up and I was like, oh no.
p39
aVBut it was a good moment.
p40
aVI was gonna wait literally just five or six more days \u2014 that's OK.
p41
aa(lp42
VGK: I know, because it was weird, Serena, because it only said 20 weeks,
p43
aVso it's not like there was a whole lot of information on it.
p44
aa(lp45
VSW: Exactly, so that's what I've been doing all this time.
p46
aVI've been just tracking it.
p47
aV18, 19 \u2014 every week I'd just take a picture and save it,
p48
aVand I've been so good about it,
p49
aVand this was the one time that I slipped.
p50
aa(lp51
VGK: There you go. Well, congratulations.
p52
aa(lp53
VSW: Yes, thank you.
p54
aa(lp55
VGK: It really is OK. When you heard the news,
p56
aVwere you excited? Were you afraid? Were you worried?
p57
aVThat you were pregnant, I mean.
p58
aa(lp59
VSW: So I heard it two days before the beginning of the Australian Open,
p60
aVwhich is one of the biggest grand slams.
p61
aa(lp62
VGK: You found out two days before?
p63
aa(lp64
VSW: Yeah, so it was two days before, and I knew.
p65
aVI was nervous.
p66
aVI wasn't quite sure what to think,
p67
aVbut I just knew that at that moment
p68
aVit was really important for me to just focus right there
p69
aVat the Australian Open,
p70
aVand I was definitely not sure what to do.
p71
aVI was like, can I play?
p72
aVI know it's very dangerous, maybe, sometimes in the first 12 weeks or so,
p73
aVso I had a lot of questions.
p74
aa(lp75
VGK: But not only did you play, Ms. Williams, you won.
p76
aa(lp77
V(Cheers)
p78
aa(lp79
VSW: Yeah.
p80
aVMay I just say, 23 grand slams to you.
p81
aa(lp82
VSW: Thank you.
p83
aa(lp84
V(Applause)
p85
aa(lp86
VGK: While pregnant!
p87
aa(lp88
VSW: Well, I was looking for another handicap, so ... no.
p89
aa(lp90
VGK: Did you play differently that game, knowing you were pregnant?
p91
aa(lp92
VSW: I did. It wasn't very easy.
p93
aVYou hear all these stories about people when they're pregnant,
p94
aVthey get sick and they get tired.
p95
aa(lp96
VGK: Have you had morning sickness?
p97
aa(lp98
VSW: No, I've been so fortunate and so I haven't.
p99
aVBut they get really tired and they get really stressed out,
p100
aVand I had to really take all that energy,
p101
aVput it in a paper bag, so to say,
p102
aVand throw it away,
p103
aVbecause I really felt like I didn't have time
p104
aVto deal with any extra emotions, any extra anything,
p105
aVbecause pregnant or not, no one knew,
p106
aVand I was supposed to win that tournament
p107
aVas I am every tournament that I show up.
p108
aVI am expected to win,
p109
aVand if I don't win, it's actually much bigger news.
p110
aa(lp111
VGK: Yeah, when you don't win, that's a big story.
p112
aa(lp113
VSW: Yes, so for me, I had to really take anything negative
p114
aVand any emotions that I was feeling at that point
p115
aVand kind of just bottle them up
p116
aVand really figure out what the next step for me to do was.
p117
aa(lp118
VGK: You have a lot of support. You have a lot of love.
p119
aVEven when I was coming here, people stopped me at the airport.
p120
aVI was saying to the flight attendant, the pilot, "Guess where I'm going?"
p121
aVThey said, "Oh my God, we're so glad she's pregnant."
p122
aVBut then you always have these cranky Yankees.
p123
aVOn the way over here, somebody was telling me about Ilie Nastase,
p124
aVwho said some very unkind, inappropriate, dare I say racial things.
p125
aVYou have responded to him.
p126
aVI'm not even going to dignify what he said,
p127
aVbut you responded. Why did you respond?
p128
aa(lp129
VSW: Well, I think there are very inappropriate comments,
p130
aVand not only that, I've been really supportive of my peers
p131
aVand the people that I've worked with.
p132
aVI've been a pro for almost 20 years,
p133
aVand so for me, it's really important to hold women up,
p134
aVand it's something that these young women,
p135
aVthey'll come to the locker room, they'll want to take pictures with me,
p136
aVand for me, it's just like,
p137
aVI want to be able to be a good leader and a good example for them.
p138
aVSo not only \u2014
p139
aa(lp140
V(Applause)
p141
aa(lp142
VNot only did he have rude things to say about me and my peers,
p143
aVI felt it was important for us to stand up for each other
p144
aVand to stand up for myself.
p145
aVAnd at that point it was really important for me to say,
p146
aVlike, I'm not afraid, I'm not going anywhere,
p147
aVbut this is inappropriate,
p148
aVand there's time and there's a place for everything.
p149
aVAnd that really wasn't the time and the place.
p150
aa(lp151
VGK: We cut the part where you said you're not going anywhere,
p152
aVbecause you'll be 36 in September. Baby's coming, 36.
p153
aVAnd your coach said age is always important,
p154
aVbut in tennis it's very important,
p155
aVbut he has no doubt that you're coming back.
p156
aVHave you thought, am I coming back?
p157
aVWill I take some time off?
p158
aVI know the women on the tour are saying,
p159
aV"How long does it take to have a baby? Two years will she be gone?"
p160
aVWhat are you thinking?
p161
aa(lp162
VSW: Well, I'm always trying to defy the odds, you know,
p163
aVso for me everything is really mental.
p164
aVI definitely plan on coming back. I'm not done yet.
p165
aVI'm really inspired by my sister.
p166
aVShe's a year older than me, and that's something that \u2014
p167
aVif she's still playing, I know I can play.
p168
aa(lp169
V(Laughter)
p170
aa(lp171
VAnd there's so many \u2014 Roger Federer, he's a little bit older than me
p172
aVand he's still winning everything, so I'm like, I know I can do that too.
p173
aVSo that's been so inspiring to me, especially recently,
p174
aVand I know that it's something I want to do.
p175
aVAnd my story is definitely not over yet.
p176
aVI was talking to my coach about it,
p177
aVand we were talking about how this is just a new part of my life,
p178
aVand my baby's going to be in the stands
p179
aVand hopefully cheering for me, not crying too much.
p180
aa(lp181
VGK: No, you wrote a beautiful letter to your baby yesterday
p182
aVthat you said \u2014 from the oldest mommy to the youngest one,
p183
aVto the oldest, to the youngest, I can't wait for you to get here.
p184
aVA lot of people feel that.
p185
aVI saw you about a year ago, because I think about your life, Serena.
p186
aVYou've had three life-changing things in a six-month time:
p187
aVpregnant, huge win, fell in love.
p188
aVAnd when I saw you last year,
p189
aVI was saying, "How's your love life? Da da da."
p190
aVYou said, "I met a guy. He's a nerdy, kinda geeky guy.
p191
aVYou won't know who he is."
p192
aVI said, "What's his name?"
p193
aa(lp194
VSW: I remember talking to you about that, yes.
p195
aa(lp196
VGK: And you said, "Alexis Ohanian." I said, "I know him!" He's awesome.
p197
aVBut I would never put you with a nerdy geek,
p198
aVand you said, you neither.
p199
aa(lp200
VSW: I'm going to be honest with you, I didn't either,
p201
aVbut it's been the best thing for me.
p202
aa(lp203
VGK: The best thing why?
p204
aVDoes that look like a nerdy geek?
p205
aVLook at the shirt.
p206
aa(lp207
V(Laughter)
p208
aa(lp209
VNo, he's a very nice guy.
p210
aa(lp211
VSW: You can tell he's into technology.
p212
aa(lp213
VGK: He's a very, very nice guy.
p214
aVI like him very much.
p215
aVSo how did he succeed when others have failed?
p216
aVHow was he the one that you knew, this is the one for me?
p217
aa(lp218
VSW: Well, I'm not going to say that,
p219
aVbut ...
p220
aa(lp221
V(Laughter)
p222
aa(lp223
VGK: Say it, Serena, say it!
p224
aa(lp225
VSW: Well ...
p226
aa(lp227
V(Laughter)
p228
aa(lp229
VYes.
p230
aa(lp231
V(Applause)
p232
aa(lp233
VGK: But you know what I mean.
p234
aa(lp235
VSW: He is very loving and he's very kind, and my mom says he's very considerate,
p236
aVand when she said that to me,
p237
aVI was like, you know, he really is,
p238
aVand it's the little things that really make a huge difference in life.
p239
aa(lp240
VGK: Like?
p241
aa(lp242
VSW: Something simple.
p243
aVMy fashion company, we have a show every year,
p244
aVso in our show last year, I was running around like crazy,
p245
aVbecause I do everything for the show,
p246
aVand everything for it,
p247
aVso I was running around like crazy,
p248
aVand he, it was a simple gesture of this shirt that he had,
p249
aVand he just wanted to make sure that I had the same one,
p250
aVand it was \u2014 it's a weird story.
p251
aVIt was better in person, I promise.
p252
aa(lp253
VGK: Was it a wonderful proposal?
p254
aVOr was it a Beyoncé song?
p255
aV"If you like it then you ought to put a ring on it"?
p256
aVWere you feeling pressure to get married?
p257
aVDid you know it was coming?
p258
aa(lp259
VSW: Yeah, I actually never felt pressure to get married
p260
aVand I can't say I'm the marrying type of person.
p261
aVI really love my life.
p262
aVI love my freedom.
p263
aVI heard that kind of changes.
p264
aVBut I love everything that I do,
p265
aVand I love my career,
p266
aVand I always felt like I didn't want anything to interfere with that.
p267
aVI've actually been so career-oriented
p268
aVand in fact, when he proposed,
p269
aVI was almost angry.
p270
aVNot almost. I was angry,
p271
aVbecause it was right in the middle of my training season,
p272
aVand I said, "I gotta win the Australian Open.
p273
aVI can't fly to Rome."
p274
aVBecause he wanted to take me to Rome,
p275
aVand I said, "I can't. I gotta win."
p276
aVBut that's how focused I was.
p277
aa(lp278
VGK: This is a girl that says, "No, I can't go to Rome." OK.
p279
aa(lp280
VSW: But I was really focused on reaching my goals
p281
aVand I knew at that point there was one player that I wanted to pass.
p282
aVI wanted to pass Steffi Graf's record,
p283
aVand that really meant a lot to me,
p284
aVand when I put my mind to something,
p285
aVI really am determined to reach it
p286
aVno matter what.
p287
aa(lp288
VGK: You know, you said that for you \u2014
p289
aVI've heard you say that winning is addictive to you.
p290
aa(lp291
VSW: It is.
p292
aa(lp293
VGK: What do you mean?
p294
aa(lp295
VSW: I feel like winning for me is superaddictive.
p296
aVI feel like once you experience it,
p297
aVyou always want to get that feeling again,
p298
aVand when I won my first championship, I was only 17 years old,
p299
aVbut I never forgot that feeling,
p300
aVand I feel like every time I win one,
p301
aVI want to reach that feeling of your first championship.
p302
aVThere's really no feeling in the world like that.
p303
aVAnd it's like, all these years of training
p304
aVand being a little kid and playing,
p305
aVand then winning is a wonderful experience.
p306
aVSo for me I've always felt like I loved that feeling,
p307
aVand obviously I don't like the feeling of losing. I feel like \u2014
p308
aa(lp309
VGK: No, in fact, people close to you say you're a very bad loser.
p310
aa(lp311
VSW: I'm not the best loser.
p312
aa(lp313
VGK: That you're very, very, very bad.
p314
aVListen, no athlete, no champion likes to lose.
p315
aVI get that.
p316
aVBut they say when it comes to losing, you are very, very, very bad at it.
p317
aa(lp318
V(Laughter)
p319
aa(lp320
VSW: I'm number one at losing too, so you know, that's all I can say.
p321
aa(lp322
V(Laughter)
p323
aa(lp324
V(Applause)
p325
aa(lp326
VGK: I'm always curious about the dynamic between you and Venus,
p327
aVbecause everybody that knows you and has followed the story
p328
aVknows that you two are very close,
p329
aVand you always bring your A game in whatever you do,
p330
aVbut I often wonder, when you're playing her,
p331
aVdo you bring your A- game because you want to do something for her
p332
aVor do you bring your A++ game because you want to crush her.
p333
aVIs it harder for you playing her or easier?
p334
aa(lp335
VSW: Well, playing Venus is like playing myself,
p336
aVbecause we grew up playing each other, we grew up practicing together.
p337
aVAnd it was something that has been difficult,
p338
aVbecause she's my toughest opponent.
p339
aVShe's tall, she's fast,
p340
aVshe hits hard like me, she serves like me.
p341
aVIt's really like playing a wall.
p342
aa(lp343
VGK: She knows you.
p344
aa(lp345
VSW: She knows where I'm hitting the ball before I hit it,
p346
aVso it's something that is not very easy,
p347
aVbut it's really about, when I go out there,
p348
aVI really have to shut down my mind and I have to say to myself,
p349
aV"You know what?
p350
aVI'm just playing a great player, but today I have to be better.
p351
aVI don't care who it is, if it's my sister or it's my friend,
p352
aVtoday is the day I have to show up and I have to be better
p353
aVand I have to want it more than anyone else at this moment
p354
aVanywhere on this world."
p355
aa(lp356
VGK: So never on the court do you fall back for Venus?
p357
aVBecause, you know, it was always Venus and Serena.
p358
aa(lp359
VSW: Yes.
p360
aa(lp361
VGK: And now baby sister has surpassed older sister.
p362
aVDo you feel guilt about that?
p363
aVDo you feel joy in that?
p364
aVIs that a difficult position for you?
p365
aa(lp366
VSW: I don't feel anything in there.
p367
aVIn my life, it still and forever is always going to be Venus and Serena.
p368
aVShe's really love of my life, she's my best friend,
p369
aVshe's my soul mate.
p370
aVI mean \u2014
p371
aVThere's pictures of her pushing me,
p372
aVreally low-quality pictures or else I would have shared them,
p373
aVof her pushing me in a stroller on a tennis court,
p374
aVand she always took care of me.
p375
aVI used to spend all of my allowance money on the ice cream truck and stuff,
p376
aVand she would take her money and give it to me at school
p377
aVand make sure I had something to eat and she would go without,
p378
aVand that's the kind of person she actually is
p379
aVsince I've always known her.
p380
aVSo we always have this incredible respect for each other
p381
aVand this incredible love,
p382
aVand I think it's important for people to realize you can be successful
p383
aVbut you can still have a wonderful relationship.
p384
aVOn the court we are mortal enemies,
p385
aVbut the second we shake hands, we are best friends again.
p386
aVAnd if I lose, it might be a day later for me,
p387
aVbut for Venus \u2014
p388
aa(lp389
V(Laughter)
p390
aa(lp391
VGK: There's never a time on the court where you hit the ball
p392
aVand say, "That's for seventh grade when you did the blah blah blah"?
p393
aVYou never have any moment like that?
p394
aa(lp395
VSW: I feel like she should have those moments,
p396
aVbecause she's never done anything bad to me,
p397
aVbut I'm the youngest. I'm the younger sister.
p398
aa(lp399
VGK: Serena, she's never done anything bad to you? Really?
p400
aVI have three sisters. I can think of some stuff I've done bad.
p401
aa(lp402
VSW: Unless she brainwashed me to forget them.
p403
aa(lp404
VGK: No, but the love you have for her I know is very pure. I know that.
p405
aa(lp406
VSW: Yes. GK: I know that.
p407
aa(lp408
VSW: We were always brought up to be superclose,
p409
aVand we are incredibly close.
p410
aVNot only her.
p411
aVI have three other sisters as well, and we were always so close.
p412
aa(lp413
VGK: So before a big match, the two of you don't get together
p414
aVand say, look, we're going to go out there and \u2014 there's nothing?
p415
aa(lp416
VSW: Well, it's funny. Before the Australian Open,
p417
aVwe were in the locker room together,
p418
aVand I always pick on her, so I pulled out my camera while she was changing.
p419
aVI started taking pictures of her, which is totally inappropriate,
p420
aVbut she was so mad at me.
p421
aVShe's like, "Serena, stop!" And I was just laughing at her.
p422
aVBut that's the kind of relationship that we have, and like I said,
p423
aVthe second we step on the court,
p424
aVit was like, we were definitely mortal enemies,
p425
aVbut the second we stepped off, and moments before, we're just \u2014
p426
aVIt is what it is, because at the end of the day,
p427
aVshe'll always be my sister.
p428
aVI'm not going to play Australia in \u2014
p429
aVWell, who knows, I've been playing forever,
p430
aVbut I don't think I'll be playing in 50 years, say?
p431
aVLet's be safe and say 50 years.
p432
aa(lp433
VGK: I don't know, Serena. There's never been anybody like you.
p434
aVWhen you think about it, never been anybody
p435
aVwho has intersected gender and race the way you have,
p436
aVthe dominance that you have and the scrutiny that you have.
p437
aVAnd when you were growing up, did you say, "I want to be like that"?
p438
aVBecause now little girls are looking at you
p439
aVsaying, "I want to be like that."
p440
aVWho was the "I want to be like that" for you?
p441
aa(lp442
VSW: Well, it's interesting, and I'm glad you brought that up.
p443
aVFor me, when I grew up, I always wanted to be the best,
p444
aVand I said, if you want to be the best, you've got to emulate the best.
p445
aVSo when I started to go on tour when I was really young,
p446
aVI would see Steffi Graf, I would see Monica Seles,
p447
aVand I would even see Pete Sampras,
p448
aVand I would see what they did,
p449
aVand I noticed that Steffi and Monica
p450
aVdidn't really talk to a lot of the other players,
p451
aVand they kind of were on their own,
p452
aVand they were just so focused
p453
aVand I would see Pete Sampras, the technique that he did,
p454
aVand I was like, "I want to do that."
p455
aVSo I did that, and I felt that to be the best,
p456
aVand if you want to be the best,
p457
aVyou have to hang around people
p458
aVand you have to look at people that are the best,
p459
aVbecause you're not going to be the best
p460
aVif you're looking at someone that's not at the top level.
p461
aa(lp462
VGK: People say nobody works as hard as you.
p463
aa(lp464
VSW: I'm a very hard worker. GK: That's what I heard.
p465
aa(lp466
VSW: People say, "Oh, she's talented, she's athletic."
p467
aVActually, I wasn't. I was really small for my age.
p468
aVI grew up when I got older,
p469
aVand I had to work really hard,
p470
aVand I think one of the reasons why I fight so hard and I work so hard
p471
aVis because I was really, really, really small.
p472
aa(lp473
VGK: Yeah.
p474
aVYou are no longer small.
p475
aa(lp476
VSW: No, I'm fully grown now.
p477
aVBut I was small when I was really young for whatever reason.
p478
aVI think Venus maybe ate all the Wheaties.
p479
aa(lp480
VGK: You know, the other thing people talk about is your body.
p481
aVYour body brings men and women to their knees.
p482
aVAnd I mean in a good way.
p483
aVA lot has been made about your body.
p484
aVIt's a work of art, it's masculine, it's glorious,
p485
aVthere's never been anything like it.
p486
aVDid you have body issues when you were growing up?
p487
aVHave you always been comfortable with your body?
p488
aa(lp489
VSW: It's interesting, because when you're a teenage female
p490
aVgrowing up in the public eye,
p491
aVit is a lot of scrutiny that you face,
p492
aVand as any female that's a teenager,
p493
aVI definitely was not comfortable in my body.
p494
aVI didn't like it.
p495
aVI didn't understand why I had muscles.
p496
aVAnd I stopped lifting weights.
p497
aVI was like, I'm not going to do this.
p498
aVBut then after I won the US Open,
p499
aVI realized that my body helped me reach goals that I wanted to reach,
p500
aVand I wanted to be happy with it,
p501
aVand I was so appreciative of it.
p502
aVI'm always healthy.
p503
aVI'm really fortunate and superblessed,
p504
aVand I felt like not only am I happy with my body,
p505
aVbut I want other people and other young girls
p506
aVthat have experienced what I've experienced
p507
aVto be happy with themselves.
p508
aVSo whatever people say \u2014
p509
aVmasculine, whatever, too much, too little \u2014
p510
aVI'm OK with it as long as I love myself.
p511
aa(lp512
V(Applause)
p513
aa(lp514
VGK: I know you learn a lot from winning,
p515
aVbut what have you learned from losing?
p516
aa(lp517
VSW: I hate to lose, but I think losing has brought me here today.
p518
aVThe only reason I am who I am is because of my losses,
p519
aVand some of them are extremely painful,
p520
aVbut I wouldn't take any of them away,
p521
aVbecause every time I lose,
p522
aVit takes a really long time for me to lose again
p523
aVbecause I learn so much from it.
p524
aVAnd I encourage everyone that I talk to \u2014
p525
aVI'm like, listen, if you lose or if something happens \u2014
p526
aVnot in sports \u2014 in business or in school \u2014
p527
aVlearn from it.
p528
aVDon't live in the past, live in the present,
p529
aVand don't make the same mistakes in the future.
p530
aVThat's something that I always try to live by.
p531
aa(lp532
VGK: Now you're planning a wedding
p533
aVand I want to know, is it a destination wedding
p534
aVin the Catskills or Poconos or are you going to do it in Florida?
p535
aVWhat are you thinking?
p536
aVBig or small?
p537
aa(lp538
VSW: We're thinking medium size. We don't want to do too big,
p539
aVbut then we're like, OK, we can't say no to this person, this person.
p540
aVSo we're thinking medium size and we're just thinking \u2014
p541
aVMy personality is a lot of fun. Hopefully you can see that today.
p542
aVI'm not too serious.
p543
aa(lp544
VGK: And you like to dance.
p545
aVAnd the next chapter for Serena Williams is what?
p546
aa(lp547
VSW: Oh, next for me.
p548
aVObviously I'm going to have a baby
p549
aVand I'm going to stay fit and kind of come back and play tennis
p550
aVand keep working on my fashion line.
p551
aVThat'll be really fun.
p552
aa(lp553
VGK: Do you know if it's a boy or girl?
p554
aa(lp555
VSW: I don't. I have a feeling of one or the other.
p556
aVIt's a 50-50 chance, but I have a feeling.
p557
aa(lp558
VGK: Gayle is a unisex name.
p559
aVWhatever you and Alexis decide, we are cheering you on!
p560
aa(lp561
VSW: Thank you for that. GK: You're welcome.
p562
aVWe are cheering you on, Serena Williams. SW: Thank you so much.
