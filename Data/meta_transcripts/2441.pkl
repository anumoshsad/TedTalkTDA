VI was excited to be a part of the "Dream" theme,
p4
aVand then I found out I'm leading off the "Nightmare?" section of it.
p5
aa(lp6
V(Laughter)
p7
aa(lp8
VAnd certainly there are things about the climate crisis that qualify.
p9
aVAnd I have some bad news,
p10
aVbut I have a lot more good news.
p11
aVI'm going to propose three questions
p12
aVand the answer to the first one
p13
aVnecessarily involves a little bad news.
p14
aVBut \u2014 hang on, because the answers to the second and third questions
p15
aVreally are very positive.
p16
aa(lp17
VSo the first question is, "Do we really have to change?"
p18
aVAnd of course, the Apollo Mission, among other things
p19
aVchanged the environmental movement,
p20
aVreally launched the modern environmental movement.
p21
aV18 months after this Earthrise picture was first seen on earth,
p22
aVthe first Earth Day was organized.
p23
aVAnd we learned a lot about ourselves
p24
aVlooking back at our planet from space.
p25
aVAnd one of the things that we learned
p26
aVconfirmed what the scientists have long told us.
p27
aVOne of the most essential facts
p28
aVabout the climate crisis has to do with the sky.
p29
aVAs this picture illustrates,
p30
aVthe sky is not the vast and limitless expanse
p31
aVthat appears when we look up from the ground.
p32
aVIt is a very thin shell of atmosphere
p33
aVsurrounding the planet.
p34
aVThat right now is the open sewer for our industrial civilization
p35
aVas it's currently organized.
p36
aVWe are spewing 110 million tons
p37
aVof heat-trapping global warming pollution into it every 24 hours,
p38
aVfree of charge, go ahead.
p39
aa(lp40
VAnd there are many sources of the greenhouse gases,
p41
aVI'm certainly not going to go through them all.
p42
aVI'm going to focus on the main one,
p43
aVbut agriculture is involved, diet is involved, population is involved.
p44
aVManagement of forests, transportation,
p45
aVthe oceans, the melting of the permafrost.
p46
aVBut I'm going to focus on the heart of the problem,
p47
aVwhich is the fact that we still rely on dirty, carbon-based fuels
p48
aVfor 85 percent of all the energy that our world burns every year.
p49
aVAnd you can see from this image that after World War II,
p50
aVthe emission rates started really accelerating.
p51
aVAnd the accumulated amount of man-made, global warming pollution
p52
aVthat is up in the atmosphere now
p53
aVtraps as much extra heat energy as would be released
p54
aVby 400,000 Hiroshima-class atomic bombs exploding
p55
aVevery 24 hours, 365 days a year.
p56
aVFact-checked over and over again,
p57
aVconservative, it's the truth.
p58
aVNow it's a big planet, but \u2014
p59
aa(lp60
V(Explosion sound)
p61
aa(lp62
Vthat is a lot of energy,
p63
aVparticularly when you multiply it 400,000 times per day.
p64
aVAnd all that extra heat energy
p65
aVis heating up the atmosphere, the whole earth system.
p66
aa(lp67
VLet's look at the atmosphere.
p68
aVThis is a depiction
p69
aVof what we used to think of as the normal distribution of temperatures.
p70
aVThe white represents normal temperature days;
p71
aV1951-1980 are arbitrarily chosen.
p72
aVThe blue are cooler than average days,
p73
aVthe red are warmer than average days.
p74
aVBut the entire curve has moved to the right in the 1980s.
p75
aVAnd you'll see in the lower right-hand corner
p76
aVthe appearance of statistically significant numbers
p77
aVof extremely hot days.
p78
aVIn the 90s, the curve shifted further.
p79
aVAnd in the last 10 years, you see the extremely hot days
p80
aVare now more numerous than the cooler than average days.
p81
aVIn fact, they are 150 times more common on the surface of the earth
p82
aVthan they were just 30 years ago.
p83
aa(lp84
VSo we're having record-breaking temperatures.
p85
aVFourteen of the 15 of the hottest years ever measured with instruments
p86
aVhave been in this young century.
p87
aVThe hottest of all was last year.
p88
aVLast month was the 371st month in a row
p89
aVwarmer than the 20th-century average.
p90
aVAnd for the first time, not only the warmest January,
p91
aVbut for the first time, it was more than two degrees Fahrenheit warmer
p92
aVthan the average.
p93
aVThese higher temperatures are having an effect on animals,
p94
aVplants, people, ecosystems.
p95
aa(lp96
VBut on a global basis, 93 percent of all the extra heat energy
p97
aVis trapped in the oceans.
p98
aVAnd the scientists can measure the heat buildup
p99
aVmuch more precisely now
p100
aVat all depths: deep, mid-ocean,
p101
aVthe first few hundred meters.
p102
aVAnd this, too, is accelerating.
p103
aVIt goes back more than a century.
p104
aVAnd more than half of the increase has been in the last 19 years.
p105
aVThis has consequences.
p106
aa(lp107
VThe first order of consequence:
p108
aVthe ocean-based storms get stronger.
p109
aVSuper Typhoon Haiyan went over areas of the Pacific
p110
aVfive and a half degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal
p111
aVbefore it slammed into Tacloban,
p112
aVas the most destructive storm ever to make landfall.
p113
aVPope Francis, who has made such a difference to this whole issue,
p114
aVvisited Tacloban right after that.
p115
aVSuperstorm Sandy went over areas of the Atlantic
p116
aVnine degrees warmer than normal
p117
aVbefore slamming into New York and New Jersey.
p118
aVThe second order of consequences are affecting all of us right now.
p119
aVThe warmer oceans are evaporating much more water vapor into the skies.
p120
aVAverage humidity worldwide has gone up four percent.
p121
aVAnd it creates these atmospheric rivers.
p122
aVThe Brazilian scientists call them "flying rivers."
p123
aVAnd they funnel all of that extra water vapor over the land
p124
aVwhere storm conditions trigger these massive record-breaking downpours.
p125
aVThis is from Montana.
p126
aVTake a look at this storm last August.
p127
aVAs it moves over Tucson, Arizona.
p128
aVIt literally splashes off the city.
p129
aVThese downpours are really unusual.
p130
aa(lp131
VLast July in Houston, Texas,
p132
aVit rained for two days, 162 billion gallons.
p133
aVThat represents more than two days of the full flow of Niagara Falls
p134
aVin the middle of the city,
p135
aVwhich was, of course, paralyzed.
p136
aVThese record downpours are creating historic floods and mudslides.
p137
aa(lp138
VThis one is from Chile last year.
p139
aVAnd you'll see that warehouse going by.
p140
aVThere are oil tankers cars going by.
p141
aVThis is from Spain last September,
p142
aVyou could call this the running of the cars and trucks, I guess.
p143
aVEvery night on the TV news now is like a nature hike
p144
aVthrough the Book of Revelation.
p145
aa(lp146
V(Laughter)
p147
aa(lp148
VI mean, really.
p149
aa(lp150
VThe insurance industry has certainly noticed,
p151
aVthe losses have been mounting up.
p152
aVThey're not under any illusions about what's happening.
p153
aVAnd the causality requires a moment of discussion.
p154
aVWe're used to thinking of linear cause and linear effect \u2014
p155
aVone cause, one effect.
p156
aVThis is systemic causation.
p157
aVAs the great Kevin Trenberth says,
p158
aV"All storms are different now.
p159
aVThere's so much extra energy in the atmosphere,
p160
aVthere's so much extra water vapor.
p161
aVEvery storm is different now."
p162
aVSo, the same extra heat pulls the soil moisture out of the ground
p163
aVand causes these deeper, longer, more pervasive droughts
p164
aVand many of them are underway right now.
p165
aa(lp166
VIt dries out the vegetation
p167
aVand causes more fires in the western part of North America.
p168
aVThere's certainly been evidence of that, a lot of them.
p169
aa(lp170
VMore lightning,
p171
aVas the heat energy builds up, there's a considerable amount
p172
aVof additional lightning also.
p173
aa(lp174
VThese climate-related disasters also have geopolitical consequences
p175
aVand create instability.
p176
aVThe climate-related historic drought that started in Syria in 2006
p177
aVdestroyed 60 percent of the farms in Syria,
p178
aVkilled 80 percent of the livestock,
p179
aVand drove 1.5 million climate refugees into the cities of Syria,
p180
aVwhere they collided with another 1.5 million refugees
p181
aVfrom the Iraq War.
p182
aVAnd along with other factors, that opened the gates of Hell
p183
aVthat people are trying to close now.
p184
aVThe US Defense Department has long warned
p185
aVof consequences from the climate crisis,
p186
aVincluding refugees, food and water shortages
p187
aVand pandemic disease.
p188
aa(lp189
VRight now we're seeing microbial diseases from the tropics spread
p190
aVto the higher latitudes;
p191
aVthe transportation revolution has had a lot to do with this.
p192
aVBut the changing conditions change the latitudes and the areas
p193
aVwhere these microbial diseases can become endemic
p194
aVand change the range of the vectors, like mosquitoes and ticks that carry them.
p195
aVThe Zika epidemic now \u2014
p196
aVwe're better positioned in North America
p197
aVbecause it's still a little too cool and we have a better public health system.
p198
aVBut when women in some regions of South and Central America
p199
aVare advised not to get pregnant for two years \u2014
p200
aVthat's something new, that ought to get our attention.
p201
aVThe Lancet, one of the two greatest medical journals in the world,
p202
aVlast summer labeled this a medical emergency now.
p203
aVAnd there are many factors because of it.
p204
aa(lp205
VThis is also connected to the extinction crisis.
p206
aVWe're in danger of losing 50 percent of all the living species on earth
p207
aVby the end of this century.
p208
aVAnd already, land-based plants and animals
p209
aVare now moving towards the poles
p210
aVat an average rate of 15 feet per day.
p211
aa(lp212
VSpeaking of the North Pole,
p213
aVlast December 29, the same storm that caused historic flooding
p214
aVin the American Midwest,
p215
aVraised temperatures at the North Pole
p216
aV50 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal,
p217
aVcausing the thawing of the North Pole
p218
aVin the middle of the long, dark, winter, polar night.
p219
aVAnd when the land-based ice of the Arctic melts,
p220
aVit raises sea level.
p221
aa(lp222
VPaul Nicklen's beautiful photograph from Svalbard illustrates this.
p223
aVIt's more dangerous coming off Greenland
p224
aVand particularly, Antarctica.
p225
aVThe 10 largest risk cities for sea-level rise by population
p226
aVare mostly in South and Southeast Asia.
p227
aVWhen you measure it by assets at risk, number one is Miami:
p228
aVthree and a half trillion dollars at risk.
p229
aVNumber three: New York and Newark.
p230
aVI was in Miami last fall during the supermoon,
p231
aVone of the highest high-tide days.
p232
aVAnd there were fish from the ocean swimming in some of the streets
p233
aVof Miami Beach and Fort Lauderdale
p234
aVand Del Rey.
p235
aVAnd this happens regularly during the highest-tide tides now.
p236
aVNot with rain \u2014 they call it "sunny-day flooding."
p237
aVIt comes up through the storm sewers.
p238
aVAnd the Mayor of Miami speaks for many when he says
p239
aVit is long past time this can be viewed through a partisan lens.
p240
aVThis is a crisis that's getting worse day by day.
p241
aVWe have to move beyond partisanship.
p242
aa(lp243
VAnd I want to take a moment to honor these House Republicans \u2014
p244
aa(lp245
V(Applause)
p246
aa(lp247
Vwho had the courage last fall
p248
aVto step out and take a political risk,
p249
aVby telling the truth about the climate crisis.
p250
aa(lp251
VSo the cost of the climate crisis is mounting up,
p252
aVthere are many of these aspects I haven't even mentioned.
p253
aVIt's an enormous burden.
p254
aVI'll mention just one more,
p255
aVbecause the World Economic Forum last month in Davos,
p256
aVafter their annual survey of 750 economists,
p257
aVsaid the climate crisis is now the number one risk
p258
aVto the global economy.
p259
aVSo you get central bankers
p260
aVlike Mark Carney, the head of the UK Central Bank,
p261
aVsaying the vast majority of the carbon reserves are unburnable.
p262
aVSubprime carbon.
p263
aVI'm not going to remind you what happened with subprime mortgages,
p264
aVbut it's the same thing.
p265
aVIf you look at all of the carbon fuels that were burned
p266
aVsince the beginning of the industrial revolution,
p267
aVthis is the quantity burned in the last 16 years.
p268
aVHere are all the ones that are proven and left on the books,
p269
aV28 trillion dollars.
p270
aVThe International Energy Agency says only this amount can be burned.
p271
aVSo the rest, 22 trillion dollars \u2014
p272
aVunburnable.
p273
aVRisk to the global economy.
p274
aVThat's why divestment movement makes practical sense
p275
aVand is not just a moral imperative.
p276
aa(lp277
VSo the answer to the first question, "Must we change?"
p278
aVis yes, we have to change.
p279
aVSecond question, "Can we change?"
p280
aVThis is the exciting news!
p281
aVThe best projections in the world 16 years ago
p282
aVwere that by 2010, the world would be able to install
p283
aV30 gigawatts of wind capacity.
p284
aVWe beat that mark by 14 and a half times over.
p285
aVWe see an exponential curve for wind installations now.
p286
aVWe see the cost coming down dramatically.
p287
aVSome countries \u2014 take Germany, an industrial powerhouse
p288
aVwith a climate not that different from Vancouver's, by the way \u2014
p289
aVone day last December,
p290
aVgot 81 percent of all its energy from renewable resources,
p291
aVmainly solar and wind.
p292
aVA lot of countries are getting more than half on an average basis.
p293
aa(lp294
VMore good news:
p295
aVenergy storage, from batteries particularly,
p296
aVis now beginning to take off
p297
aVbecause the cost has been coming down very dramatically
p298
aVto solve the intermittency problem.
p299
aVWith solar, the news is even more exciting!
p300
aVThe best projections 14 years ago were that we would install
p301
aVone gigawatt per year by 2010.
p302
aVWhen 2010 came around, we beat that mark by 17 times over.
p303
aVLast year, we beat it by 58 times over.
p304
aVThis year, we're on track to beat it 68 times over.
p305
aa(lp306
VWe're going to win this.
p307
aVWe are going to prevail.
p308
aVThe exponential curve on solar is even steeper and more dramatic.
p309
aVWhen I came to this stage 10 years ago,
p310
aVthis is where it was.
p311
aVWe have seen a revolutionary breakthrough
p312
aVin the emergence of these exponential curves.
p313
aa(lp314
V(Applause)
p315
aa(lp316
VAnd the cost has come down 10 percent per year
p317
aVfor 30 years.
p318
aVAnd it's continuing to come down.
p319
aa(lp320
VNow, the business community has certainly noticed this,
p321
aVbecause it's crossing the grid parity point.
p322
aVCheaper solar penetration rates are beginning to rise.
p323
aVGrid parity is understood as that line, that threshold,
p324
aVbelow which renewable electricity is cheaper than electricity
p325
aVfrom burning fossil fuels.
p326
aVThat threshold is a little bit like the difference
p327
aVbetween 32 degrees Fahrenheit and 33 degrees Fahrenheit,
p328
aVor zero and one Celsius.
p329
aVIt's a difference of more than one degree,
p330
aVit's the difference between ice and water.
p331
aVAnd it's the difference between markets that are frozen up,
p332
aVand liquid flows of capital into new opportunities for investment.
p333
aVThis is the biggest new business opportunity
p334
aVin the history of the world,
p335
aVand two-thirds of it is in the private sector.
p336
aVWe are seeing an explosion of new investment.
p337
aVStarting in 2010, investments globally in renewable electricity generation
p338
aVsurpassed fossils.
p339
aVThe gap has been growing ever since.
p340
aVThe projections for the future are even more dramatic,
p341
aVeven though fossil energy is now still subsidized
p342
aVat a rate 40 times larger than renewables.
p343
aVAnd by the way, if you add the projections for nuclear on here,
p344
aVparticularly if you assume that the work many are doing
p345
aVto try to break through to safer and more acceptable,
p346
aVmore affordable forms of nuclear,
p347
aVthis could change even more dramatically.
p348
aa(lp349
VSo is there any precedent for such a rapid adoption
p350
aVof a new technology?
p351
aVWell, there are many, but let's look at cell phones.
p352
aVIn 1980, AT&T, then Ma Bell,
p353
aVcommissioned McKinsey to do a global market survey
p354
aVof those clunky new mobile phones that appeared then.
p355
aV"How many can we sell by the year 2000?" they asked.
p356
aVMcKinsey came back and said, "900,000."
p357
aVAnd sure enough, when the year 2000 arrived,
p358
aVthey did sell 900,000 \u2014 in the first three days.
p359
aVAnd for the balance of the year, they sold 120 times more.
p360
aVAnd now there are more cell connections than there are people in the world.
p361
aa(lp362
VSo, why were they not only wrong, but way wrong?
p363
aVI've asked that question myself, "Why?"
p364
aa(lp365
V(Laughter)
p366
aa(lp367
VAnd I think the answer is in three parts.
p368
aVFirst, the cost came down much faster than anybody expected,
p369
aVeven as the quality went up.
p370
aVAnd low-income countries, places that did not have a landline grid \u2014
p371
aVthey leap-frogged to the new technology.
p372
aVThe big expansion has been in the developing counties.
p373
aVSo what about the electricity grids in the developing world?
p374
aVWell, not so hot.
p375
aVAnd in many areas, they don't exist.
p376
aVThere are more people without any electricity at all in India
p377
aVthan the entire population of the United States of America.
p378
aVSo now we're getting this:
p379
aVsolar panels on grass huts
p380
aVand new business models that make it affordable.
p381
aVMuhammad Yunus financed this one in Bangladesh with micro-credit.
p382
aVThis is a village market.
p383
aVBangladesh is now the fastest-deploying country in the world:
p384
aVtwo systems per minute on average, night and day.
p385
aVAnd we have all we need:
p386
aVenough energy from the Sun comes to the earth
p387
aVevery hour to supply the full world's energy needs for an entire year.
p388
aVIt's actually a little bit less than an hour.
p389
aVSo the answer to the second question, "Can we change?"
p390
aVis clearly "Yes."
p391
aVAnd it's an ever-firmer "yes."
p392
aa(lp393
VLast question, "Will we change?"
p394
aVParis really was a breakthrough,
p395
aVsome of the provisions are binding
p396
aVand the regular reviews will matter a lot.
p397
aVBut nations aren't waiting, they're going ahead.
p398
aVChina has already announced that starting next year,
p399
aVthey're adopting a nationwide cap and trade system.
p400
aVThey will likely link up with the European Union.
p401
aVThe United States has already been changing.
p402
aVAll of these coal plants were proposed
p403
aVin the next 10 years and canceled.
p404
aVAll of these existing coal plants were retired.
p405
aVAll of these coal plants have had their retirement announced.
p406
aVAll of them \u2014 canceled.
p407
aVWe are moving forward.
p408
aVLast year \u2014 if you look at all of the investment
p409
aVin new electricity generation in the United States,
p410
aValmost three-quarters was from renewable energy,
p411
aVmostly wind and solar.
p412
aa(lp413
VWe are solving this crisis.
p414
aVThe only question is: how long will it take to get there?
p415
aVSo, it matters that a lot of people are organizing
p416
aVto insist on this change.
p417
aVAlmost 400,000 people marched in New York City
p418
aVbefore the UN special session on this.
p419
aVMany thousands, tens of thousands,
p420
aVmarched in cities around the world.
p421
aVAnd so, I am extremely optimistic.
p422
aVAs I said before, we are going to win this.
p423
aa(lp424
VI'll finish with this story.
p425
aVWhen I was 13 years old,
p426
aVI heard that proposal by President Kennedy
p427
aVto land a person on the Moon and bring him back safely
p428
aVin 10 years.
p429
aVAnd I heard adults of that day and time say,
p430
aV"That's reckless, expensive, may well fail."
p431
aVBut eight years and two months later,
p432
aVin the moment that Neil Armstrong set foot on the Moon,
p433
aVthere was great cheer that went up in NASA's mission control in Houston.
p434
aVHere's a little-known fact about that:
p435
aVthe average age of the systems engineers,
p436
aVthe controllers in the room that day, was 26,
p437
aVwhich means, among other things,
p438
aVtheir age, when they heard that challenge, was 18.
p439
aa(lp440
VWe now have a moral challenge
p441
aVthat is in the tradition of others that we have faced.
p442
aVOne of the greatest poets of the last century in the US,
p443
aVWallace Stevens,
p444
aVwrote a line that has stayed with me:
p445
aV"After the final 'no,' there comes a 'yes,'
p446
aVand on that 'yes', the future world depends."
p447
aVWhen the abolitionists started their movement,
p448
aVthey met with no after no after no.
p449
aVAnd then came a yes.
p450
aVThe Women's Suffrage and Women's Rights Movement
p451
aVmet endless no's, until finally, there was a yes.
p452
aVThe Civil Rights Movement, the movement against apartheid,
p453
aVand more recently, the movement for gay and lesbian rights
p454
aVhere in the United States and elsewhere.
p455
aVAfter the final "no" comes a "yes."
p456
aa(lp457
VWhen any great moral challenge is ultimately resolved
p458
aVinto a binary choice between what is right and what is wrong,
p459
aVthe outcome is fore-ordained because of who we are as human beings.
p460
aVNinety-nine percent of us, that is where we are now
p461
aVand it is why we're going to win this.
p462
aVWe have everything we need.
p463
aVSome still doubt that we have the will to act,
p464
aVbut I say the will to act is itself a renewable resource.
p465
aa(lp466
VThank you very much.
p467
aa(lp468
V(Applause)
p469
aa(lp470
VChris Anderson: You've got this incredible combination of skills.
p471
aVYou've got this scientist mind that can understand
p472
aVthe full range of issues,
p473
aVand the ability to turn it into the most vivid language.
p474
aVNo one else can do that, that's why you led this thing.
p475
aVIt was amazing to see it 10 years ago, it was amazing to see it now.
p476
aa(lp477
VAl Gore: Well, you're nice to say that, Chris.
p478
aVBut honestly, I have a lot of really good friends
p479
aVin the scientific community who are incredibly patient
p480
aVand who will sit there and explain this stuff to me
p481
aVover and over and over again
p482
aVuntil I can get it into simple enough language
p483
aVthat I can understand it.
p484
aVAnd that's the key to trying to communicate.
p485
aa(lp486
VCA: So, your talk. First part: terrifying,
p487
aVsecond part: incredibly hopeful.
p488
aVHow do we know that all those graphs, all that progress, is enough
p489
aVto solve what you showed in the first part?
p490
aa(lp491
VAG: I think that the crossing \u2014
p492
aVyou know, I've only been in the business world for 15 years.
p493
aVBut one of the things I've learned is that apparently it matters
p494
aVif a new product or service is more expensive
p495
aVthan the incumbent, or cheaper than.
p496
aVTurns out, it makes a difference if it's cheaper than.
p497
aa(lp498
V(Laughter)
p499
aa(lp500
VAnd when it crosses that line,
p501
aVthen a lot of things really change.
p502
aVWe are regularly surprised by these developments.
p503
aVThe late Rudi Dornbusch, the great economist said,
p504
aV"Things take longer to happen then you think they will,
p505
aVand then they happen much faster than you thought they could."
p506
aVI really think that's where we are.
p507
aVSome people are using the phrase "The Solar Singularity" now,
p508
aVmeaning when it gets below the grid parity,
p509
aVunsubsidized in most places,
p510
aVthen it's the default choice.
p511
aa(lp512
VNow, in one of the presentations yesterday, the jitney thing,
p513
aVthere is an effort to use regulations to slow this down.
p514
aVAnd I just don't think it's going to work.
p515
aa(lp516
VThere's a woman in Atlanta, Debbie Dooley,
p517
aVwho's the Chairman of the Atlanta Tea Party.
p518
aVThey enlisted her in this effort to put a tax
p519
aVon solar panels and regulations.
p520
aVAnd she had just put solar panels on her roof
p521
aVand she didn't understand the request.
p522
aa(lp523
V(Laughter)
p524
aa(lp525
VAnd so she went and formed an alliance with the Sierra Club
p526
aVand they formed a new organization called the Green Tea Party.
p527
aa(lp528
V(Laughter)
p529
aa(lp530
V(Applause)
p531
aa(lp532
VAnd they defeated the proposal.
p533
aVSo, finally, the answer to your question is,
p534
aVthis sounds a little corny and maybe it's a cliché,
p535
aVbut 10 years ago \u2014 and Christiana referred to this \u2014
p536
aVthere are people in this audience who played an incredibly significant role
p537
aVin generating those exponential curves.
p538
aVAnd it didn't work out economically for some of them,
p539
aVbut it kick-started this global revolution.
p540
aVAnd what people in this audience do now
p541
aVwith the knowledge that we are going to win this.
p542
aVBut it matters a lot how fast we win it.
p543
aa(lp544
VCA: Al Gore, that was incredibly powerful.
p545
aVIf this turns out to be the year,
p546
aVthat the partisan thing changes,
p547
aVas you said, it's no longer a partisan issue,
p548
aVbut you bring along people from the other side together,
p549
aVbacked by science, backed by these kinds of investment opportunities,
p550
aVbacked by reason that you win the day \u2014
p551
aVboy, that's really exciting.
p552
aa(lp553
VThank you so much.
p554
aa(lp555
VAG: Thank you so much for bringing me back to TED.
