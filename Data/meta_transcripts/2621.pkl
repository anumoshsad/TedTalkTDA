VI feel incredibly lucky
p4
aVto be from a country
p5
aVthat's generally considered to be the best place in the world
p6
aVto be a woman.
p7
aa(lp8
VIn 1975, when I was seven years old,
p9
aVwomen in Iceland went on a strike.
p10
aVThey did no work that day,
p11
aVwhether they held professional jobs
p12
aVor had the work of the home.
p13
aVThey marched into the center of Reykjavík \u2014
p14
aV90 percent of women participated \u2014
p15
aVand peacefully and in solidarity
p16
aVasked for equality.
p17
aVNothing worked in Iceland that day,
p18
aVbecause nothing works when women are not at work.
p19
aa(lp20
V(Applause)
p21
aa(lp22
VFive years later, Icelanders had the courage
p23
aVto be the first country in the world
p24
aVto democratically elect a woman as their president.
p25
aVI will never forget this day,
p26
aVthat President Vigdís, as we know her by her first name,
p27
aVstepped out on the balcony of her own home,
p28
aVa single mom with her daughter by her side as she had won.
p29
aa(lp30
V(Applause)
p31
aa(lp32
VThis woman was an incredible role model
p33
aVfor me and everyone growing up at that time,
p34
aVincluding boys.
p35
aVShe frequently shares the story of how a young boy approached her
p36
aVafter a couple of terms in office
p37
aVand asked, "Can boys really grow up to be president?"
p38
aa(lp39
V(Laughter)
p40
aa(lp41
VRole models really matter,
p42
aVbut even with such strong role models
p43
aVwho I am so grateful for,
p44
aVwhen I was encouraged to run for president,
p45
aVmy first reaction was, "Who am I to run for president?
p46
aVWho am I to be president?"
p47
aa(lp48
VIt turns out that women
p49
aVare less likely to consider running than men.
p50
aVSo a study done in the US in 2011
p51
aVshowed that 62 percent of men had considered running for office,
p52
aVbut 45 percent of women.
p53
aVThat's gap of 16 percentage points,
p54
aVand it's the same gap that existed a decade earlier.
p55
aVAnd it really is a shame,
p56
aVbecause I am so convinced that the world is in real need for women leaders
p57
aVand more principle-based leadership
p58
aVin general.
p59
aa(lp60
VSo my decision to run
p61
aVultimately came down to the fact
p62
aVthat I felt
p63
aVthat I had to do my bit,
p64
aVeven if I had no political experience,
p65
aVto step up and try to be part of creating the world
p66
aVthat will make sense and be sustainable
p67
aVfor our kids,
p68
aVand a world where we truly allow both our boys and girls
p69
aVto be all they can be.
p70
aa(lp71
VAnd it was the journey of my life.
p72
aVIt was amazing.
p73
aVThe journey started with potentially as many as 20 candidates.
p74
aVIt boiled down to nine candidates qualifying,
p75
aVand ultimately the race came down to four of us,
p76
aVthree men and me.
p77
aa(lp78
V(Applause)
p79
aa(lp80
VBut that's not all the drama yet.
p81
aVYou may think you have drama in the US,
p82
aVbut I can \u2014
p83
aa(lp84
V(Laughter)
p85
aa(lp86
VI can assure you we had our own drama in Iceland.
p87
aVSo our sitting president of 20 years
p88
aVannounced initially that he was not going to run,
p89
aVwhich is probably what gave rise
p90
aVto so many candidates considering running.
p91
aVThen later he changed his mind
p92
aVwhen our prime minister resigned
p93
aVfollowing the infamous Panama Papers
p94
aVthat implicated him and his family.
p95
aVAnd there was a popular protest in Iceland,
p96
aVso the sitting president thought they needed a trusted leader.
p97
aVA few days later, relations to his wife and her family's companies
p98
aVwere also discovered in the Panama Papers,
p99
aVand so he withdrew from the race again.
p100
aVBefore doing so, he said he was doing that
p101
aVbecause now there were two qualified men
p102
aVwho he felt could fill his shoes running for office.
p103
aa(lp104
VSo on May 9, 45 days before election day,
p105
aVit was not looking too good for me.
p106
aVI did not even make the graph in the newspaper.
p107
aVThe polls had me at 1 percent,
p108
aVbut that was still the highest
p109
aVthat any woman announcing her candidacy had earned.
p110
aVSo it would be an understatement to say that I had to work extremely hard
p111
aVto get my seat at the table
p112
aVand access to television,
p113
aVbecause the network decided that they would only include
p114
aVthose with 2.5 percent or more in the polls
p115
aVin the first TV debate.
p116
aVI found out on the afternoon of the first TV debate
p117
aVthat I would participate along with the three men,
p118
aVand I found out on live TV
p119
aVthat I came in at exactly 2.5 percent on the day of the first TV debate.
p120
aa(lp121
V(Applause)
p122
aa(lp123
VSo, challenges.
p124
aVThe foremost challenges I had to face and overcome on this journey
p125
aVhad to do with media, muscle and money.
p126
aVLet's start with media.
p127
aVThere are those who say gender doesn't matter
p128
aVwhen it comes to media and politics.
p129
aVI can't say that I agree.
p130
aVIt proved harder for me to both get access and airtime in media.
p131
aVAs a matter of fact, the leading candidate appeared in broadcast media
p132
aV87 times in the months leading up to the elections,
p133
aVwhereas I appeared 31 times.
p134
aVAnd I am not saying media is doing this consciously.
p135
aVI think largely this has to do with unconscious bias,
p136
aVbecause in media, much like everywhere else,
p137
aVwe have both conscious and unconscious bias,
p138
aVand we need to have the courage to talk about it if we want to change it.
p139
aa(lp140
VWhen I finally got access to TV,
p141
aVthe first question I got was, "Are you going to quit?"
p142
aVAnd that was a hard one.
p143
aVBut of course, with 1 percent to 2.5 percent in the polls,
p144
aVmaybe it's understandable.
p145
aVBut media really matters, and every time I appeared on TV,
p146
aVwe saw and experienced a rise in the polls,
p147
aVso I know firsthand how much this matters
p148
aVand why we have to talk about it.
p149
aVI was the only one out of the final four candidates
p150
aVthat never got a front page interview.
p151
aVI was sometimes left out of the questions asked of all other candidates
p152
aVand out of coverage about the elections.
p153
aVSo I did face this,
p154
aVbut I will say this to compliment the Icelandic media.
p155
aVI got few if any comments about my hair and pantsuit.
p156
aa(lp157
V(Applause)
p158
aa(lp159
VSo kudos to them.
p160
aVBut there is another experience that's very important.
p161
aVI ran as an independent candidate,
p162
aVnot with any political party or muscle behind me.
p163
aVThat lack of experience
p164
aVand lack of access to resources
p165
aVprobably came at a cost to our campaign,
p166
aVbut it also allowed us to innovate and do politics differently.
p167
aVWe ran a positive campaign,
p168
aVand we probably changed the tone of the election for others by doing that.
p169
aVIt may be the reason why I had less airtime on TV,
p170
aVbecause I wanted to show other contenders respect.
p171
aa(lp172
VWhen access to media proved to be so difficult,
p173
aVwe ran our own media.
p174
aVI ran live Facebook sessions
p175
aVwhere I took questions from voters on anything and responded on the spot.
p176
aVAnd we put all the questions I got and all the answers on an open Facebook
p177
aVbecause we thought transparency is important
p178
aVif you want to establish trust.
p179
aVAnd when reaching young voters proved to be challenging,
p180
aVI became a Snapchatter.
p181
aVI got young people to teach me how to do that,
p182
aVand I used every filter on Snapchat during the last part of the campaign.
p183
aVAnd I actually had to use a lot of humor and humility, as I was very bad at it.
p184
aVBut we grew the following amongst young people by doing that.
p185
aVSo it's possible to run a different type of campaign.
p186
aa(lp187
VBut unfortunately, one cannot talk about politics without mentioning money.
p188
aVI am sad that it is that way, but it's true,
p189
aVand we had less financial resources than the other candidates.
p190
aVThis probably was partly due to the fact
p191
aVthat I think I had a harder time asking for financial support.
p192
aVAnd maybe I also had the ambition to do more with less.
p193
aVSome would call that very womanly of me.
p194
aa(lp195
VBut even with one third the media, one third the financial resources,
p196
aVand only an entrepreneurial team, but an amazing team,
p197
aVwe managed to surprise everyone on election night,
p198
aVwhen the first numbers came in.
p199
aVI surprised myself, as you may see in that photo.
p200
aa(lp201
V(Laughter)
p202
aa(lp203
VSo the first numbers,
p204
aVI came in neck to neck to the leading candidate.
p205
aa(lp206
V(Cheers)
p207
aa(lp208
VWell, too early, because I didn't quite pull that,
p209
aVbut I came in second,
p210
aVand we went a long way from the one percent,
p211
aVwith nearly a third of the vote,
p212
aVand we beat the polls by an unprecedented margin,
p213
aVor 10 percentage points above what the last poll came in at.
p214
aa(lp215
VSome people call me the real winner of the election because of this,
p216
aVand there are many people who encouraged me to run again.
p217
aVBut what really makes me proud
p218
aVis to know that I earned
p219
aVproportionately higher percentage support from the young people,
p220
aVand a lot of people encouraged my daughter to run in 2040.
p221
aa(lp222
V(Applause)
p223
aa(lp224
VShe is 13,
p225
aVand she had never been on TV before.
p226
aVAnd on election day, I observed her on TV repeatedly,
p227
aVand she was smart, she was self-confident,
p228
aVshe was sincere, and she was supportive of her mother.
p229
aVThis was probably the highlight of my campaign.
p230
aa(lp231
V(Applause)
p232
aa(lp233
VBut there was another one.
p234
aVThese are preschool girls out on a walk,
p235
aVand they found a poster of me on a bus stop,
p236
aVand they saw the need to kiss it.
p237
aa(lp238
VAudience: Aw!
p239
aa(lp240
VThis picture was really enough of a win for me.
p241
aVWhat we see, we can be.
p242
aVSo screw fear and challenges.
p243
aa(lp244
V(Applause)
p245
aa(lp246
VIt matters that women run,
p247
aVand it's time for women to run for office,
p248
aVbe it the office of the CEO or the office of the president.
p249
aVI also managed to put an impression on your very own "New Yorker."
p250
aVI earned a new title, "A living emoji of sincerity."
p251
aa(lp252
V(Cheers)
p253
aa(lp254
VIt is possibly my proudest title yet,
p255
aVand the reason is that women too often get penalized
p256
aVfor using what I call their emotional capital,
p257
aVbut I know from experience that we become so good
p258
aVwhen we do just that.
p259
aa(lp260
V(Applause)
p261
aa(lp262
VAnd we need more of that.
p263
aa(lp264
VWe celebrated as if we had won on election night,
p265
aVbecause that's how we felt.
p266
aVSo you don't necessarily have to reach that office.
p267
aVYou just have to go for it,
p268
aVand you, your family, your friends, everyone working with you,
p269
aVif you do it well, you will grow beyond anything you will experience before.
p270
aa(lp271
VSo we had a good time,
p272
aVand I learned a lot on this journey,
p273
aVprobably more lessons than I can share here
p274
aVin the time we have today.
p275
aVBut rest assured, it was hard work.
p276
aVI lost a lot of sleep during those months.
p277
aVIt took resilience and perseverance to not quit,
p278
aVbut I learned something that I knew before on the one percent day,
p279
aVand that is that you can only be good
p280
aVwhen you are truly, authentically listening to your own voice
p281
aVand working in alignment with that.
p282
aVAs a good sister of mine sometimes says,
p283
aVyou may cheat on your intuition,
p284
aVbut your intuition never cheats on you.
p285
aa(lp286
VI think it's also very important, and you all know this,
p287
aVthat on any journey you go on,
p288
aVit's the team you take along.
p289
aVIt's having people around you who share your values, your vision,
p290
aVbut are different in every other way.
p291
aVThat's the formula for success for me,
p292
aVand I am blessed with an amazing husband,
p293
aVhere today,
p294
aVan incredible family \u2014
p295
aa(lp296
V(Applause)
p297
aa(lp298
Vand great friends,
p299
aVand we came together as entrepreneurs in the political arena,
p300
aVand pulled something off that everyone said would be impossible.
p301
aVAs a matter of fact, the leading PR expert told me
p302
aVbefore I made my decision
p303
aVthat I would do well to get seven percent.
p304
aVI appreciated his perspective, because he was probably right,
p305
aVand he was basing it on valuable experience.
p306
aVBut on the one percent day,
p307
aVI decided here to show him that he was wrong.
p308
aa(lp309
VIt's very important to mention this, because I did lose a lot of sleep,
p310
aVand I worked hard, and so did the people with me.
p311
aVWe can never go the distance if we forget to take care of ourselves.
p312
aVAnd it's two things that I think are very important in that,
p313
aVin surrounding yourself with people and practices that nourish you,
p314
aVbut it's equally important, maybe even more important,
p315
aVto have the courage to get rid of people and practices
p316
aVthat take away your energy,
p317
aVincluding the wonderful bloggers and commentators.
p318
aVI took a lot of support from others in doing this,
p319
aVand I made the decision to go high when others went low,
p320
aVand that's partly how I kept my energy going throughout all of this.
p321
aVAnd when I lost my energy for a moment \u2014
p322
aVand I did from time to time, it wasn't easy \u2014
p323
aVI went back to why I decided to run,
p324
aVand how I had decided to run my own race.
p325
aa(lp326
VI called it a 4G campaign,
p327
aVthe G's representing the Icelandic words.
p328
aVAnd the first one is called "Gagn."
p329
aVI ran to do good,
p330
aVto be of service,
p331
aVand I wanted servant leadership
p332
aVto be at the center of how I worked and everybody else in the campaign.
p333
aVSecond one is "Gleði," or joy.
p334
aVI decided to enjoy the journey.
p335
aVThere was a lot to be taken out of the journey,
p336
aVno matter if the destination was reached or not.
p337
aVAnd I tried my utmost to inspire others to do so as well.
p338
aVThird is "Gagnsæi."
p339
aVI was open to any questions.
p340
aVI kept no secrets,
p341
aVand it was all open, on Facebook and websites.
p342
aVBecause I think if you're choosing your president,
p343
aVyou deserve answers to your questions.
p344
aVLast but not least,
p345
aVI don't need to explain that in this room,
p346
aVwe ran on the principle of Girlpower.
p347
aa(lp348
V(Cheers)
p349
aa(lp350
VI am incredibly glad
p351
aVthat I had the courage to run,
p352
aVto risk failure but receive success
p353
aVon so many levels.
p354
aVI can't tell you that it was easy,
p355
aVbut I can tell you,
p356
aVand I think my entire team will agree with me,
p357
aVthat it was worth it.
p358
aa(lp359
VThank you.
p360
aa(lp361
V(Applause)
p362
aa(lp363
VThank you.
p364
aVThank you.
p365
aa(lp366
V(Applause)
p367
aa(lp368
VPat Mitchell: I'm not letting you go yet.
p369
aa(lp370
VHalla Tómasdóttir: What a great crowd.
p371
aa(lp372
VPM: I can't let you go without saying
p373
aVthat probably everybody in the room is ready to move to Iceland
p374
aVand vote for you.
p375
aVBut of course we probably can't vote there,
p376
aVbut one thing we can get from Iceland
p377
aVand have always gotten is inspiration.
p378
aVI mean, I'm old enough to remember 1975
p379
aVwhen all the Icelandic women walked out,
p380
aVand that really was a very big factor in launching the women's movement.
p381
aVYou made a reference to it earlier. I'd love to bring the picture back up
p382
aVand just have us remember what it was like when a country came to a standstill.
p383
aVAnd then what you may not know
p384
aVbecause our American media did not report it,
p385
aVthe Icelandic women walked out again on Monday. Right?
p386
aa(lp387
VHT: Yes, they did. PM: Can you tell us about that?
p388
aa(lp389
VHT: Yes, so 41 years after the original strike,
p390
aVwe may be the best place in the world to be a woman,
p391
aVbut our work isn't done.
p392
aVSo at 2:38pm on Monday,
p393
aVwomen in Iceland left work,
p394
aVbecause that's when they had earned their day's salary.
p395
aa(lp396
V(Applause)
p397
aa(lp398
VWhat's really cool about this
p399
aVis that young women and men participated
p400
aVin greater numbers than before,
p401
aVbecause it is time that we close the pay gap.
p402
aa(lp403
VPM: So I'm not going to ask Halla to commit right now
p404
aVto what she's doing next,
p405
aVbut I will say that you'd have a very large volunteer army
p406
aVshould you decide to do that again.
p407
aVThank you Halla.
p408
aa(lp409
