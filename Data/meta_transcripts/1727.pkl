VWell, I have a big announcement to make today,
p4
aVand I'm really excited about this.
p5
aVAnd this may be a little bit of a surprise
p6
aVto many of you who know my research
p7
aVand what I've done well.
p8
aVI've really tried to solve some big problems:
p9
aVcounterterrorism, nuclear terrorism,
p10
aVand health care and diagnosing and treating cancer,
p11
aVbut I started thinking about all these problems,
p12
aVand I realized that the really biggest problem we face,
p13
aVwhat all these other problems come down to,
p14
aVis energy, is electricity, the flow of electrons.
p15
aVAnd I decided that I was going to set out
p16
aVto try to solve this problem.
p17
aa(lp18
VAnd this probably is not what you're expecting.
p19
aVYou're probably expecting me to come up here
p20
aVand talk about fusion,
p21
aVbecause that's what I've done most of my life.
p22
aVBut this is actually a talk about, okay \u2014
p23
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p24
aVbut this is actually a talk about fission.
p25
aVIt's about perfecting something old,
p26
aVand bringing something old into the 21st century.
p27
aa(lp28
VLet's talk a little bit about how nuclear fission works.
p29
aVIn a nuclear power plant, you have
p30
aVa big pot of water that's under high pressure,
p31
aVand you have some fuel rods,
p32
aVand these fuel rods are encased in zirconium,
p33
aVand they're little pellets of uranium dioxide fuel,
p34
aVand a fission reaction is controlled and maintained at a proper level,
p35
aVand that reaction heats up water,
p36
aVthe water turns to steam, steam turns the turbine,
p37
aVand you produce electricity from it.
p38
aVThis is the same way we've been producing electricity,
p39
aVthe steam turbine idea, for 100 years,
p40
aVand nuclear was a really big advancement
p41
aVin a way to heat the water,
p42
aVbut you still boil water and that turns to steam and turns the turbine.
p43
aa(lp44
VAnd I thought, you know, is this the best way to do it?
p45
aVIs fission kind of played out,
p46
aVor is there something left to innovate here?
p47
aVAnd I realized that I had hit upon something
p48
aVthat I think has this huge potential to change the world.
p49
aVAnd this is what it is.
p50
aa(lp51
VThis is a small modular reactor.
p52
aVSo it's not as big as the reactor you see in the diagram here.
p53
aVThis is between 50 and 100 megawatts.
p54
aVBut that's a ton of power.
p55
aVThat's between, say at an average use,
p56
aVthat's maybe 25,000 to 100,000 homes could run off that.
p57
aVNow the really interesting thing about these reactors
p58
aVis they're built in a factory.
p59
aVSo they're modular reactors that are built
p60
aVessentially on an assembly line,
p61
aVand they're trucked anywhere in the world,
p62
aVyou plop them down, and they produce electricity.
p63
aVThis region right here is the reactor.
p64
aa(lp65
VAnd this is buried below ground, which is really important.
p66
aVFor someone who's done a lot of counterterrorism work,
p67
aVI can't extol to you
p68
aVhow great having something buried below the ground is
p69
aVfor proliferation and security concerns.
p70
aa(lp71
VAnd inside this reactor is a molten salt,
p72
aVso anybody who's a fan of thorium,
p73
aVthey're going to be really excited about this,
p74
aVbecause these reactors happen to be really good
p75
aVat breeding and burning the thorium fuel cycle,
p76
aVuranium-233.
p77
aa(lp78
VBut I'm not really concerned about the fuel.
p79
aVYou can run these off \u2014 they're really hungry,
p80
aVthey really like down-blended weapons pits,
p81
aVso that's highly enriched uranium and weapons-grade plutonium
p82
aVthat's been down-blended.
p83
aVIt's made into a grade where it's not usable for a nuclear weapon,
p84
aVbut they love this stuff.
p85
aVAnd we have a lot of it sitting around,
p86
aVbecause this is a big problem.
p87
aVYou know, in the Cold War, we built up this huge arsenal
p88
aVof nuclear weapons, and that was great,
p89
aVand we don't need them anymore,
p90
aVand what are we doing with all the waste, essentially?
p91
aVWhat are we doing with all the pits of those nuclear weapons?
p92
aVWell, we're securing them, and it would be great
p93
aVif we could burn them, eat them up,
p94
aVand this reactor loves this stuff.
p95
aa(lp96
VSo it's a molten salt reactor. It has a core,
p97
aVand it has a heat exchanger from the hot salt,
p98
aVthe radioactive salt, to a cold salt which isn't radioactive.
p99
aVIt's still thermally hot but it's not radioactive.
p100
aVAnd then that's a heat exchanger
p101
aVto what makes this design really, really interesting,
p102
aVand that's a heat exchanger to a gas.
p103
aVSo going back to what I was saying before about all power
p104
aVbeing produced \u2014 well, other than photovoltaic \u2014
p105
aVbeing produced by this boiling of steam and turning a turbine,
p106
aVthat's actually not that efficient, and in fact,
p107
aVin a nuclear power plant like this,
p108
aVit's only roughly 30 to 35 percent efficient.
p109
aVThat's how much thermal energy the reactor's putting out
p110
aVto how much electricity it's producing.
p111
aVAnd the reason the efficiencies are so low is these reactors
p112
aVoperate at pretty low temperature.
p113
aVThey operate anywhere from, you know,
p114
aVmaybe 200 to 300 degrees Celsius.
p115
aVAnd these reactors run at 600 to 700 degrees Celsius,
p116
aVwhich means the higher the temperature you go to,
p117
aVthermodynamics tells you that you will have higher efficiencies.
p118
aVAnd this reactor doesn't use water. It uses gas,
p119
aVso supercritical CO2 or helium,
p120
aVand that goes into a turbine,
p121
aVand this is called the Brayton cycle.
p122
aVThis is the thermodynamic cycle that produces electricity,
p123
aVand this makes this almost 50 percent efficient,
p124
aVbetween 45 and 50 percent efficiency.
p125
aVAnd I'm really excited about this,
p126
aVbecause it's a very compact core.
p127
aVMolten salt reactors are very compact by nature,
p128
aVbut what's also great is you get a lot more electricity out
p129
aVfor how much uranium you're fissioning,
p130
aVnot to mention the fact that these burn up.
p131
aVTheir burn-up is much higher.
p132
aVSo for a given amount of fuel you put in the reactor,
p133
aVa lot more of it's being used.
p134
aa(lp135
VAnd the problem with a traditional nuclear power plant like this
p136
aVis, you've got these rods that are clad in zirconium,
p137
aVand inside them are uranium dioxide fuel pellets.
p138
aVWell, uranium dioxide's a ceramic,
p139
aVand ceramic doesn't like releasing what's inside of it.
p140
aVSo you have what's called the xenon pit,
p141
aVand so some of these fission products love neutrons.
p142
aVThey love the neutrons that are going on
p143
aVand helping this reaction take place.
p144
aVAnd they eat them up, which means that, combined with
p145
aVthe fact that the cladding doesn't last very long,
p146
aVyou can only run one of these reactors
p147
aVfor roughly, say, 18 months without refueling it.
p148
aVSo these reactors run for 30 years without refueling,
p149
aVwhich is, in my opinion, very, very amazing,
p150
aVbecause it means it's a sealed system.
p151
aVNo refueling means you can seal them up
p152
aVand they're not going to be a proliferation risk,
p153
aVand they're not going to have
p154
aVeither nuclear material or radiological material
p155
aVproliferated from their cores.
p156
aa(lp157
VBut let's go back to safety, because everybody
p158
aVafter Fukushima had to reassess the safety of nuclear,
p159
aVand one of the things when I set out to design a power reactor
p160
aVwas it had to be passively and intrinsically safe,
p161
aVand I'm really excited about this reactor
p162
aVfor essentially two reasons.
p163
aVOne, it doesn't operate at high pressure.
p164
aVSo traditional reactors like a pressurized water reactor
p165
aVor boiling water reactor, they're very, very hot water
p166
aVat very high pressures, and this means, essentially,
p167
aVin the event of an accident, if you had any kind of breach
p168
aVof this stainless steel pressure vessel,
p169
aVthe coolant would leave the core.
p170
aVThese reactors operate at essentially atmospheric pressure,
p171
aVso there's no inclination for the fission products
p172
aVto leave the reactor in the event of an accident.
p173
aVAlso, they operate at high temperatures,
p174
aVand the fuel is molten, so they can't melt down,
p175
aVbut in the event that the reactor ever went out of tolerances,
p176
aVor you lost off-site power in the case
p177
aVof something like Fukushima, there's a dump tank.
p178
aVBecause your fuel is liquid, and it's combined with your coolant,
p179
aVyou could actually just drain the core
p180
aVinto what's called a sub-critical setting,
p181
aVbasically a tank underneath the reactor
p182
aVthat has some neutrons absorbers.
p183
aVAnd this is really important, because the reaction stops.
p184
aVIn this kind of reactor, you can't do that.
p185
aVThe fuel, like I said, is ceramic inside zirconium fuel rods,
p186
aVand in the event of an accident in one of these type of reactors,
p187
aVFukushima and Three Mile Island \u2014
p188
aVlooking back at Three Mile Island, we didn't really see this for a while \u2014
p189
aVbut these zirconium claddings on these fuel rods,
p190
aVwhat happens is, when they see high pressure water,
p191
aVsteam, in an oxidizing environment,
p192
aVthey'll actually produce hydrogen,
p193
aVand that hydrogen has this explosive capability
p194
aVto release fission products.
p195
aVSo the core of this reactor, since it's not under pressure
p196
aVand it doesn't have this chemical reactivity,
p197
aVmeans that there's no inclination for the fission products
p198
aVto leave this reactor.
p199
aVSo even in the event of an accident,
p200
aVyeah, the reactor may be toast, which is, you know,
p201
aVsorry for the power company,
p202
aVbut we're not going to contaminate large quantities of land.
p203
aVSo I really think that in the, say,
p204
aV20 years it's going to take us to get fusion
p205
aVand make fusion a reality,
p206
aVthis could be the source of energy
p207
aVthat provides carbon-free electricity.
p208
aVCarbon-free electricity.
p209
aa(lp210
VAnd it's an amazing technology because
p211
aVnot only does it combat climate change,
p212
aVbut it's an innovation.
p213
aVIt's a way to bring power to the developing world,
p214
aVbecause it's produced in a factory and it's cheap.
p215
aVYou can put them anywhere in the world you want to.
p216
aa(lp217
VAnd maybe something else.
p218
aVAs a kid, I was obsessed with space.
p219
aVWell, I was obsessed with nuclear science too, to a point,
p220
aVbut before that I was obsessed with space,
p221
aVand I was really excited about, you know,
p222
aVbeing an astronaut and designing rockets,
p223
aVwhich was something that was always exciting to me.
p224
aVBut I think I get to come back to this,
p225
aVbecause imagine having a compact reactor in a rocket
p226
aVthat produces 50 to 100 megawatts.
p227
aVThat is the rocket designer's dream.
p228
aVThat's someone who is designing a habitat on another planet's dream.
p229
aVNot only do you have 50 to 100 megawatts
p230
aVto power whatever you want to provide propulsion to get you there,
p231
aVbut you have power once you get there.
p232
aVYou know, rocket designers who use solar panels
p233
aVor fuel cells, I mean a few watts or kilowatts \u2014
p234
aVwow, that's a lot of power.
p235
aVI mean, now we're talking about 100 megawatts.
p236
aVThat's a ton of power.
p237
aVThat could power a Martian community.
p238
aVThat could power a rocket there.
p239
aVAnd so I hope that
p240
aVmaybe I'll have an opportunity to kind of explore
p241
aVmy rocketry passion at the same time that I explore my nuclear passion.
p242
aa(lp243
VAnd people say, "Oh, well, you've launched this thing,
p244
aVand it's radioactive, into space, and what about accidents?"
p245
aVBut we launch plutonium batteries all the time.
p246
aVEverybody was really excited about Curiosity,
p247
aVand that had this big plutonium battery on board
p248
aVthat has plutonium-238,
p249
aVwhich actually has a higher specific activity
p250
aVthan the low-enriched uranium fuel of these molten salt reactors,
p251
aVwhich means that the effects would be negligible,
p252
aVbecause you launch it cold,
p253
aVand when it gets into space is where you actually activate this reactor.
p254
aa(lp255
VSo I'm really excited.
p256
aVI think that I've designed this reactor here
p257
aVthat can be an innovative source of energy,
p258
aVprovide power for all kinds of neat scientific applications,
p259
aVand I'm really prepared to do this.
p260
aVI graduated high school in May, and \u2014
p261
aV(Laughter) (Applause) \u2014
p262
aVI graduated high school in May,
p263
aVand I decided that I was going to start up a company
p264
aVto commercialize these technologies that I've developed,
p265
aVthese revolutionary detectors for scanning cargo containers
p266
aVand these systems to produce medical isotopes,
p267
aVbut I want to do this, and I've slowly been building up
p268
aVa team of some of the most incredible people
p269
aVI've ever had the chance to work with,
p270
aVand I'm really prepared to make this a reality.
p271
aVAnd I think, I think, that looking at the technology,
p272
aVthis will be cheaper than or the same price as natural gas,
p273
aVand you don't have to refuel it for 30 years,
p274
aVwhich is an advantage for the developing world.
p275
aa(lp276
VAnd I'll just say one more maybe philosophical thing
p277
aVto end with, which is weird for a scientist.
p278
aVBut I think there's something really poetic
p279
aVabout using nuclear power to propel us to the stars,
p280
aVbecause the stars are giant fusion reactors.
p281
aVThey're giant nuclear cauldrons in the sky.
p282
aVThe energy that I'm able to talk to you today,
p283
aVwhile it was converted to chemical energy in my food,
p284
aVoriginally came from a nuclear reaction,
p285
aVand so there's something poetic about, in my opinion,
p286
aVperfecting nuclear fission
p287
aVand using it as a future source of innovative energy.
p288
aa(lp289
VSo thank you guys.
