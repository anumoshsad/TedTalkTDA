VI'm going to talk about a technology that we're developing at Oxford now,
p4
aVthat we think is going to change the way that
p5
aVcomputer games and Hollywood movies are being made.
p6
aVThat technology is simulating humans.
p7
aVIt's simulated humans with a simulated body
p8
aVand a simulated nervous system to control that body.
p9
aVNow, before I talk more about that technology,
p10
aVlet's have a quick look at what human characters look like
p11
aVat the moment in computer games.
p12
aVThis is a clip from a game called "Grand Theft Auto 3."
p13
aVWe already saw that briefly yesterday.
p14
aVAnd what you can see is \u2014 it is actually a very good game.
p15
aVIt's one of the most successful games of all time.
p16
aVBut what you'll see is that all the animations in this game are very repetitive.
p17
aVThey pretty much look the same.
p18
aVI've made him run into a wall here, over and over again.
p19
aVAnd you can see he looks always the same.
p20
aVThe reason for that is that these characters
p21
aVare actually not real characters.
p22
aVThey are a graphical visualization of a character.
p23
aa(lp24
VTo produce these animations, an animator at a studio has to anticipate
p25
aVwhat's going to happen in the actual game,
p26
aVand then has to animate that particular sequence.
p27
aVSo, he or she sits down, animates it, and tries to anticipate what's going to happen,
p28
aVand then these particular animations are just played back
p29
aVat appropriate times in the computer game.
p30
aVNow, the result of that is that you can't have real interactivity.
p31
aVAll you have is animations that are played back
p32
aVat more or less the appropriate times.
p33
aVIt also means that games aren't really going to be as surprising as they could be,
p34
aVbecause you only get out of it, at least in terms of the character,
p35
aVwhat you actually put into it.
p36
aVThere's no real emergence there.
p37
aa(lp38
VAnd thirdly, as I said, most of the animations are very repetitive because of that.
p39
aVNow, the only way to get around that
p40
aVis to actually simulate the human body
p41
aVand to simulate that bit of the nervous system of the brain that controls that body.
p42
aVAnd maybe, if I could have you for a quick demonstration
p43
aVto show what the difference is \u2014
p44
aVbecause, I mean, it's very, very trivial.
p45
aVIf I push Chris a bit, like this, for example, he'll react to it.
p46
aVIf I push him from a different angle, he'll react to it differently,
p47
aVand that's because he has a physical body,
p48
aVand because he has the motor skills to control that body.
p49
aVIt's a very trivial thing.
p50
aVIt's not something you get in computer games at the moment, at all.
p51
aVThank you very much. Chris Anderson: That's it?
p52
aa(lp53
VTorsten Reil: That's it, yes.
p54
aVSo, that's what we're trying to simulate \u2014
p55
aVnot Chris specifically, I should say, but humans in general.
p56
aVNow, we started working on this a while ago at Oxford University,
p57
aVand we tried to start very simply.
p58
aVWhat we tried to do was teach a stick figure how to walk.
p59
aVThat stick figure is physically stimulated. You can see it here on the screen.
p60
aVSo, it's subject to gravity, has joints, etc.
p61
aVIf you just run the simulation, it will just collapse, like this.
p62
aVThe tricky bit is now to put an AI controller in it
p63
aVthat actually makes it work.
p64
aVAnd for that, we use the neural network, which we based on
p65
aVthat part of the nervous system that we have in our spine
p66
aVthat controls walking in humans.
p67
aVIt's called the central pattern generator.
p68
aVSo, we simulated that as well, and then the really tricky bit
p69
aVis to teach that network how to walk.
p70
aVFor that we used artificial evolution \u2014 genetic algorithms.
p71
aa(lp72
VWe heard about those already yesterday,
p73
aVand I suppose that most of you are familiar with that already.
p74
aVBut, just briefly, the concept is that
p75
aVyou create a large number of different individuals \u2014
p76
aVneural networks, in this case \u2014
p77
aVall of which are random at the beginning.
p78
aVYou hook these up \u2014 in this case, to the virtual muscles
p79
aVof that two-legged creature here \u2014
p80
aVand hope that it does something interesting.
p81
aVAt the beginning, they're all going to be very boring.
p82
aVMost of them won't move at all,
p83
aVbut some of them might make a tiny step.
p84
aVThose are then selected by the algorithm,
p85
aVreproduced with mutation and recombinations to introduce sex as well.
p86
aVAnd you repeat that process over and over again,
p87
aVuntil you have something that walks \u2014
p88
aVin this case, in a straight line, like this.
p89
aVSo that was the idea behind this.
p90
aVWhen we started this, I set up the simulation one evening.
p91
aVIt took about three to four hours to run the simulation.
p92
aVI got up the next morning, went to the computer and looked at the results,
p93
aVand was hoping for something that walked in a straight line,
p94
aVlike I've just demonstrated,
p95
aVand this is what I got instead.
p96
aa(lp97
V(Laughter)
p98
aa(lp99
VSo, it was back to the drawing board for us.
p100
aVWe did get it to work eventually,
p101
aVafter tweaking a bit here and there.
p102
aVAnd this is an example of a successful evolutionary run.
p103
aVSo, what you'll see in a moment is a very simple biped
p104
aVthat's learning how to walk using artificial evolution.
p105
aVAt the beginning, it can't walk at all,
p106
aVbut it will get better and better over time.
p107
aVSo, this is the one that can't walk at all.
p108
aa(lp109
V(Laughter)
p110
aa(lp111
VNow, after five generations of applying evolutionary process,
p112
aVthe genetic algorithm is getting a tiny bit better.
p113
aa(lp114
V(Laughter)
p115
aa(lp116
VGeneration 10 and it'll take a few steps more \u2014
p117
aVstill not quite there.
p118
aVBut now, after generation 20, it actually walks in a straight line without falling over.
p119
aVThat was the real breakthrough for us.
p120
aVIt was, academically, quite a challenging project,
p121
aVand once we had reached that stage, we were quite confident
p122
aVthat we could try and do other things as well with this approach \u2014
p123
aVactually simulating the body
p124
aVand simulating that part of the nervous system that controls it.
p125
aVNow, at this stage, it also became clear that this could be very exciting
p126
aVfor things like computer games or online worlds.
p127
aVWhat you see here is the character standing there,
p128
aVand there's an obstacle that we put in its way.
p129
aVAnd what you see is, it's going to fall over the obstacle.
p130
aVNow, the interesting bit is, if I move the obstacle a tiny bit to the right,
p131
aVwhich is what I'm doing now, here,
p132
aVit will fall over it in a completely different way.
p133
aVAnd again, if you move the obstacle a tiny bit, it'll again fall differently.
p134
aa(lp135
V(Laughter)
p136
aa(lp137
VNow, what you see, by the way, at the top there,
p138
aVare some of the neural activations being fed into the virtual muscles.
p139
aVOkay. That's the video. Thanks.
p140
aVNow, this might look kind of trivial, but it's actually very important
p141
aVbecause this is not something you get at the moment
p142
aVin any interactive or any virtual worlds.
p143
aVNow, at this stage, we decided to start a company and move this further,
p144
aVbecause obviously this was just a very simple, blocky biped.
p145
aVWhat we really wanted was a full human body.
p146
aVSo we started the company.
p147
aVWe hired a team of physicists, software engineers and biologists
p148
aVto work on this, and the first thing we had to work on
p149
aVwas to create the human body, basically.
p150
aVIt's got to be relatively fast, so you can run it on a normal machine,
p151
aVbut it's got to be accurate enough, so it looks good enough, basically.
p152
aa(lp153
VSo we put quite a bit of biomechanical knowledge into this thing,
p154
aVand tried to make it as realistic as possible.
p155
aVWhat you see here on the screen right now
p156
aVis a very simple visualization of that body.
p157
aVI should add that it's very simple to add things like hair, clothes, etc.,
p158
aVbut what we've done here is use a very simple visualization,
p159
aVso you can concentrate on the movement.
p160
aVNow, what I'm going to do right now, in a moment,
p161
aVis just push this character a tiny bit and we'll see what happens.
p162
aVNothing really interesting, basically.
p163
aVIt falls over, but it falls over like a rag doll, basically.
p164
aVThe reason for that is that there's no intelligence in it.
p165
aVIt becomes interesting when you put artificial intelligence into it.
p166
aVSo, this character now has motor skills in the upper body \u2014
p167
aVnothing in the legs yet, in this particular one.
p168
aVBut what it will do \u2014 I'm going to push it again.
p169
aVIt will realize autonomously that it's being pushed.
p170
aVIt's going to stick out its hands.
p171
aVIt's going to turn around into the fall, and try and catch the fall.
p172
aVSo that's what you see here.
p173
aa(lp174
VNow, it gets really interesting
p175
aVif you then add the AI for the lower part of the body as well.
p176
aVSo here, we've got the same character.
p177
aVI'm going to push it a bit harder now,
p178
aVharder than I just pushed Chris.
p179
aVBut what you'll see is \u2014 it's going to receive a push now from the left.
p180
aVWhat you see is it takes steps backwards,
p181
aVit tries to counter-balance,
p182
aVit tries to look at the place where it thinks it's going to land.
p183
aVI'll show you this again.
p184
aVAnd then, finally hits the floor.
p185
aVNow, this becomes really exciting
p186
aVwhen you push that character in different directions, again, just as I've done.
p187
aVThat's something that you cannot do right now.
p188
aVAt the moment, you only have empty computer graphics in games.
p189
aVWhat this is now is a real simulation. That's what I want to show you now.
p190
aa(lp191
VSo, here's the same character with the same behavior I've just shown you,
p192
aVbut now I'm just going to push it from different directions.
p193
aVFirst, starting with a push from the right.
p194
aVThis is all slow motion, by the way, so we can see what's going on.
p195
aVNow, the angle will have changed a tiny bit,
p196
aVso you can see that the reaction is different.
p197
aVAgain, a push, now this time from the front.
p198
aVAnd you see it falls differently.
p199
aVAnd now from the left \u2014
p200
aVand it falls differently.
p201
aVThat was really exciting for us to see that.
p202
aVThat was the first time we've seen that.
p203
aVThis is the first time the public sees this as well,
p204
aVbecause we have been in stealth mode.
p205
aVI haven't shown this to anybody yet.
p206
aVNow, just a fun thing:
p207
aVwhat happens if you put that character \u2014
p208
aVthis is now a wooden version of it, but it's got the same AI in it \u2014
p209
aVbut if you put that character on a slippery surface, like ice.
p210
aVWe just did that for a laugh, just to see what happens.
p211
aa(lp212
V(Laughter)
p213
aa(lp214
VAnd this is what happens.
p215
aa(lp216
V(Laughter)
p217
aa(lp218
V(Applause)
p219
aa(lp220
VIt's nothing we had to do about this.
p221
aVWe just took this character that I just talked about,
p222
aVput it on a slippery surface, and this is what you get out of it.
p223
aVAnd that's a really fascinating thing about this approach.
p224
aVNow, when we went to film studios and games developers
p225
aVand showed them that technology, we got a very good response.
p226
aVAnd what they said was, the first thing they need immediately is virtual stuntmen.
p227
aVBecause stunts are obviously very dangerous, they're very expensive,
p228
aVand there are a lot of stunt scenes that you cannot do, obviously,
p229
aVbecause you can't really allow the stuntman to be seriously hurt.
p230
aVSo, they wanted to have a digital version of a stuntman
p231
aVand that's what we've been working on for the past few months.
p232
aVAnd that's our first product that we're going to release in a couple of weeks.
p233
aVSo, here are just a few very simple scenes of the guy just being kicked.
p234
aVThat's what people want. That's what we're giving them.
p235
aa(lp236
V(Laughter)
p237
aa(lp238
VYou can see, it's always reacting.
p239
aVThis is not a dead body. This is a body who basically, in this particular case,
p240
aVfeels the force and tries to protect its head.
p241
aVOnly, I think it's quite a big blow again.
p242
aVYou feel kind of sorry for that thing,
p243
aVand we've seen it so many times now that
p244
aVwe don't really care any more.
p245
aa(lp246
V(Laughter)
p247
aa(lp248
VThere are much worse videos than this, by the way, which I have taken out, but ...
p249
aVNow, here's another one.
p250
aVWhat people wanted as a behavior was to have an explosion,
p251
aVa strong force applied to the character,
p252
aVand have the character react to it in midair.
p253
aVSo that you don't have a character that looks limp,
p254
aVbut actually a character that you can use in an action film straight away,
p255
aVthat looks kind of alive in midair as well.
p256
aVSo this character is going to be hit by a force,
p257
aVit's going to realize it's in the air,
p258
aVand it's going to try and, well,
p259
aVstick out its arm in the direction where it's landing.
p260
aVThat's one angle; here's another angle.
p261
aVWe now think that the realism we're achieving with this
p262
aVis good enough to be used in films.
p263
aa(lp264
VAnd let's just have a look at a slightly different visualization.
p265
aVThis is something I just got last night
p266
aVfrom an animation studio in London, who are using our software
p267
aVand experimenting with it right now.
p268
aVSo this is exactly the same behavior that you saw,
p269
aVbut in a slightly better rendered version.
p270
aVSo if you look at the character carefully,
p271
aVyou see there are lots of body movements going on,
p272
aVnone of which you have to animate like in the old days.
p273
aVAnimators had to actually animate them.
p274
aVThis is all happening automatically in the simulation.
p275
aVThis is a slightly different angle,
p276
aVand again a slow motion version of this.
p277
aVThis is incredibly quick. This is happening in real time.
p278
aVYou can run this simulation in real time, in front of your eyes,
p279
aVchange it, if you want to, and you get the animation straight out of it.
p280
aVAt the moment, doing something like this by hand
p281
aVwould take you probably a couple of days.
p282
aa(lp283
VThis is another behavior they requested.
p284
aVI'm not quite sure why, but we've done it anyway.
p285
aVIt's a very simple behavior that shows you the power of this approach.
p286
aVIn this case, the character's hands
p287
aVare fixed to a particular point in space,
p288
aVand all we've told the character to do is to struggle.
p289
aVAnd it looks organic. It looks realistic.
p290
aVYou feel kind of sorry for the guy.
p291
aVIt's even worse \u2014 and that is another video I just got last night \u2014
p292
aVif you render that a bit more realistically.
p293
aa(lp294
VNow, I'm showing this to you just to show you
p295
aVhow organic it actually can feel, how realistic it can look.
p296
aVAnd this is all a physical simulation of the body,
p297
aVusing AI to drive virtual muscles in that body.
p298
aVNow, one thing which we did for a laugh was
p299
aVto create a slightly more complex stunt scene,
p300
aVand one of the most famous stunts is the one where James Bond
p301
aVjumps off a dam in Switzerland and then is caught by a bungee.
p302
aVGot a very short clip here.
p303
aa(lp304
VYes, you can just about see it here.
p305
aVIn this case, they were using a real stunt man. It was a very dangerous stunt.
p306
aVIt was just voted, I think in the Sunday Times, as one of the most impressive stunts.
p307
aVNow, we've just tried and \u2014 looked at our character and asked ourselves,
p308
aV"Can we do that ourselves as well?"
p309
aVCan we use the physical simulation of the character,
p310
aVuse artificial intelligence,
p311
aVput that artificial intelligence into the character,
p312
aVdrive virtual muscles, simulate the way he jumps off the dam,
p313
aVand then skydive afterwards,
p314
aVand have him caught by a bungee afterwards?
p315
aVWe did that. It took about altogether just two hours,
p316
aVpretty much, to create the simulation.
p317
aVAnd that's what it looks like, here.
p318
aVNow, this could do with a bit more work. It's still very early stages,
p319
aVand we pretty much just did this for a laugh,
p320
aVjust to see what we'd get out of it.
p321
aVBut what we found over the past few months
p322
aVis that this approach \u2014 that we're pretty much standard upon \u2014
p323
aVis incredibly powerful.
p324
aVWe are ourselves surprised what you actually get out of the simulations.
p325
aVThere's very often very surprising behavior that you didn't predict before.
p326
aa(lp327
VThere's so many things we can do with this right now.
p328
aVThe first thing, as I said, is going to be virtual stuntmen.
p329
aVSeveral studios are using this software now to produce virtual stuntmen,
p330
aVand they're going to hit the screen quite soon, actually,
p331
aVfor some major productions.
p332
aVThe second thing is video games.
p333
aVWith this technology, video games will look different and they will feel very different.
p334
aVFor the first time, you'll have actors that really feel very interactive,
p335
aVthat have real bodies that really react.
p336
aVI think that's going to be incredibly exciting.
p337
aVProbably starting with sports games,
p338
aVwhich are going to become much more interactive.
p339
aVBut I particularly am really excited
p340
aVabout using this technology in online worlds,
p341
aVlike there, for example, that Tom Melcher has shown us.
p342
aVThe degree of interactivity you're going to get
p343
aVis totally different, I think, from what you're getting right now.
p344
aa(lp345
VA third thing we are looking at and very interested in is simulation.
p346
aVWe've been approached by several simulation companies,
p347
aVbut one project we're particularly excited about, which we're starting next month,
p348
aVis to use our technology \u2014 and in particular, the walking technology \u2014
p349
aVto help aid surgeons who work on children with cerebral palsy,
p350
aVto predict the outcome of operations on these children.
p351
aVAs you probably know,
p352
aVit's very difficult to predict what the outcome of an operation is
p353
aVif you try and correct the gait.
p354
aa(lp355
VThe classic quote is, I think, it's unpredictable at best,
p356
aVis what people think right now, is the outcome.
p357
aVNow, what we want to do with our software is allow our surgeons to have a tool.
p358
aVWe're going to simulate the gait of a particular child
p359
aVand the surgeon can then work on that simulation
p360
aVand try out different ways to improve that gait,
p361
aVbefore he actually commits to an actual surgery.
p362
aVThat's one project we're particularly excited about,
p363
aVand that's going to start next month.
p364
aVJust finally, this is only just the beginning.
p365
aVWe can only do several behaviors right now.
p366
aVThe AI isn't good enough to simulate a full human body.
p367
aVThe body yes, but not all the motor skills that we have.
p368
aVAnd, I think, we're only there if we can have something like ballet dancing.
p369
aVRight now, we don't have that
p370
aVbut I'm very sure that we will be able to do that at some stage.
p371
aa(lp372
VWe do have one unintentional dancer actually,
p373
aVthe last thing I'm going to show you.
p374
aVThis was an AI contour that was produced and evolved \u2014
p375
aVhalf-evolved, I should say \u2014 to produce balance, basically.
p376
aVSo, you kick the guy and the guy's supposed to counter-balance.
p377
aVThat's what we thought was going to come out of this.
p378
aVBut this is what emerged out of it, in the end.
p379
aa(lp380
V(Music)
p381
aa(lp382
VBizarrely, this thing doesn't have a head. I'm not quite sure why.
p383
aVSo, this was not something we actually put in there.
p384
aVHe just started to create that dance himself.
p385
aVHe's actually a better dancer than I am, I have to say.
p386
aVAnd what you see after a while \u2014
p387
aVI think he even goes into a climax right at the end.
p388
aVAnd I think \u2014 there you go.
p389
aa(lp390
V(Laughter)
p391
aa(lp392
VSo, that all happened automatically. We didn't put that in there.
p393
aVThat's just the simulation creating this itself, basically.
p394
aVSo it's just \u2014
p395
aa(lp396
V(Applause)
p397
aa(lp398
VThanks.
p399
aVNot quite John Travolta yet, but we're working on that as well,
p400
aVso thanks very much for your time.
p401
aVThanks.
