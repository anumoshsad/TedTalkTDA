VLet me tell you a story.
p4
aa(lp5
VIt's my first year as a new high school science teacher,
p6
aVand I'm so eager.
p7
aVI'm so excited, I'm pouring myself into my lesson plans.
p8
aVBut I'm slowly coming to this horrifying realization
p9
aVthat my students just might not be learning anything.
p10
aa(lp11
VThis happens one day:
p12
aVI'd just assigned my class to read this textbook chapter
p13
aVabout my favorite subject in all of biology:
p14
aVviruses and how they attack.
p15
aVAnd so I'm so excited to discuss this with them,
p16
aVand I come in and I say, "Can somebody please explain
p17
aVthe main ideas and why this is so cool?"
p18
aa(lp19
VThere's silence.
p20
aVFinally, my favorite student, she looks me straight in the eye,
p21
aVand she says, "The reading sucked."
p22
aVAnd then she clarified. She said, "You know what,
p23
aVI don't mean that it sucks. It means that I didn't understand a word of it.
p24
aVIt's boring. Um, who cares, and it sucks."
p25
aa(lp26
VThese sympathetic smiles
p27
aVspread all throughout the room now,
p28
aVand I realize that all of my other students are in the same boat,
p29
aVthat maybe they took notes or they memorized definitions from the textbook,
p30
aVbut not one of them really understood the main ideas.
p31
aVNot one of them can tell me why this stuff is so cool,
p32
aVwhy it's so important.
p33
aa(lp34
VI'm totally clueless.
p35
aVI have no idea what to do next.
p36
aVSo the only thing I can think of is say,
p37
aV"Listen. Let me tell you a story.
p38
aVThe main characters in the story are bacteria and viruses.
p39
aVThese guys are blown up a couple million times.
p40
aVThe real bacteria and viruses are so small
p41
aVwe can't see them without a microscope,
p42
aVand you guys might know bacteria and viruses
p43
aVbecause they both make us sick.
p44
aVBut what a lot of people don't know is that viruses
p45
aVcan also make bacteria sick."
p46
aa(lp47
VNow, the story that I start telling my kids,
p48
aVit starts out like a horror story.
p49
aVOnce upon a time there's this happy little bacterium.
p50
aVDon't get too attached to him.
p51
aVMaybe he's floating around in your stomach
p52
aVor in some spoiled food somewhere,
p53
aVand all of a sudden he starts to not feel so good.
p54
aVMaybe he ate something bad for lunch,
p55
aVand then things get really horrible,
p56
aVas his skin rips apart, and he sees a virus
p57
aVcoming out from his insides.
p58
aVAnd then it gets horrible
p59
aVwhen he bursts open and an army of viruses
p60
aVfloods out from his insides.
p61
aVIf \u2014 Ouch is right! \u2014
p62
aVIf you see this, and you're a bacterium,
p63
aVthis is like your worst nightmare.
p64
aVBut if you're a virus and you see this,
p65
aVyou cross those little legs of yours and you think,
p66
aV"We rock."
p67
aVBecause it took a lot of crafty work to infect this bacterium.
p68
aVHere's what had to happen.
p69
aVA virus grabbed onto a bacterium
p70
aVand it slipped its DNA into it.
p71
aVThe next thing is, that virus DNA made stuff
p72
aVthat chopped up the bacteria DNA.
p73
aVAnd now that we've gotten rid of the bacteria DNA,
p74
aVthe virus DNA takes control of the cell
p75
aVand it tells it to start making more viruses.
p76
aVBecause, you see, DNA is like a blueprint
p77
aVthat tells living things what to make.
p78
aVSo this is kind of like going into a car factory
p79
aVand replacing the blueprints with blueprints for killer robots.
p80
aVThe workers still come the next day, they do their job,
p81
aVbut they're following different instructions.
p82
aVSo replacing the bacteria DNA with virus DNA
p83
aVturns the bacteria into a factory for making viruses \u2014
p84
aVthat is, until it's so filled with viruses that it bursts.
p85
aVBut that's not the only way that viruses infect bacteria.
p86
aVSome are much more crafty.
p87
aVWhen a secret agent virus infects a bacterium,
p88
aVthey do a little espionage.
p89
aVHere, this cloaked, secret agent virus is slipping his DNA into the bacterial cell,
p90
aVbut here's the kicker: It doesn't do anything harmful \u2014 not at first.
p91
aVInstead, it silently slips into the bacteria's own DNA,
p92
aVand it just stays there like a terrorist sleeper cell,
p93
aVwaiting for instructions.
p94
aVAnd what's interesting about this is now whenever this bacteria has babies,
p95
aVthe babies also have the virus DNA in them.
p96
aVSo now we have a whole extended bacteria family,
p97
aVfilled with virus sleeper cells.
p98
aVThey're just happily living together until a signal happens
p99
aVand \u2014 BAM! \u2014 all of the DNA pops out.
p100
aVIt takes control of these cells, turns them into virus-making factories,
p101
aVand they all burst,
p102
aVa huge, extended bacteria family,
p103
aVall dying with viruses spilling out of their guts,
p104
aVthe viruses taking over the bacterium.
p105
aVSo now you understand how viruses can attack cells.
p106
aVThere are two ways: On the left is what we call the lytic way,
p107
aVwhere the viruses go right in and take over the cells.
p108
aVOn the [right] is the lysogenic way
p109
aVthat uses secret agent viruses.
p110
aa(lp111
VSo this stuff is not that hard, right?
p112
aVAnd now all of you understand it.
p113
aVBut if you've graduated from high school,
p114
aVI can almost guarantee you've seen this information before.
p115
aVBut I bet it was presented in a way
p116
aVthat it didn't exactly stick in your mind.
p117
aa(lp118
VSo when my students were first learning this,
p119
aVwhy did they hate it so much?
p120
aVWell, there were a couple of reasons.
p121
aa(lp122
VFirst of all, I can guarantee you that their textbooks
p123
aVdidn't have secret agent viruses, and they didn't have horror stories.
p124
aVYou know, in the communication of science
p125
aVthere is this obsession with seriousness.
p126
aVIt kills me. I'm not kidding.
p127
aVI used to work for an educational publisher,
p128
aVand as a writer, I was always told never to use stories
p129
aVor fun, engaging language,
p130
aVbecause then my work might not be viewed
p131
aVas "serious" and "scientific."
p132
aVRight? I mean, because God forbid somebody have fun
p133
aVwhen they're learning science.
p134
aVSo we have this field of science that's all about slime,
p135
aVand color changes. Check this out.
p136
aVAnd then we have, of course, as any good scientist has to have,
p137
aVexplosions!
p138
aVBut if a textbook seems too much fun,
p139
aVit's somehow unscientific.
p140
aa(lp141
VNow another problem was that
p142
aVthe language in their textbook was truly incomprehensible.
p143
aVIf we want to summarize that story that I told you earlier,
p144
aVwe could start by saying something like,
p145
aV"These viruses make copies of themselves
p146
aVby slipping their DNA into a bacterium."
p147
aVThe way this showed up in the textbook, it looked like this:
p148
aV"Bacteriophage replication is initiated
p149
aVthrough the introduction of viral nucleic acid
p150
aVinto a bacterium."
p151
aVThat's great, perfect for 13-year-olds.
p152
aa(lp153
VBut here's the thing. There are plenty of people
p154
aVin science education who would look at this and say there's no way
p155
aVthat we could ever give that to students,
p156
aVbecause it contains some language that isn't completely accurate.
p157
aVFor example, I told you that viruses have DNA.
p158
aVWell, a very tiny fraction of them don't.
p159
aVThey have something called RNA instead.
p160
aVSo a professional science writer would circle that
p161
aVand say, "That has to go.
p162
aVWe have to change it to something much more technical."
p163
aVAnd after a team of professional science editors
p164
aVwent over this really simple explanation,
p165
aVthey'd find fault with almost every word I've used,
p166
aVand they'd have to change anything that wasn't serious enough,
p167
aVand they'd have to change everything
p168
aVthat wasn't 100 percent perfect.
p169
aVThen it would be accurate,
p170
aVbut it would be completely impossible to understand.
p171
aVThis is horrifying.
p172
aa(lp173
VYou know, I keep talking about this idea
p174
aVof telling a story,
p175
aVand it's like science communication has taken on this idea
p176
aVof what I call the tyranny of precision,
p177
aVwhere you can't just tell a story.
p178
aVIt's like science has become that horrible storyteller
p179
aVthat we all know, who gives us all the details nobody cares about,
p180
aVwhere you're like, "Oh, I met my friend for lunch the other day,
p181
aVand she was wearing these ugly jeans.
p182
aVI mean, they weren't really jeans, they were more kind of, like, leggings,
p183
aVbut, like, I guess they're actually kind of more like jeggings,
p184
aVlike, but I think \u2014 " and you're just like, "Oh my God.
p185
aVWhat is the point?"
p186
aVOr even worse, science education is becoming
p187
aVlike that guy who always says, "Actually."
p188
aVRight? You want to be like, "Oh, dude,
p189
aVwe had to get up in the middle of the night
p190
aVand drive a hundred miles in total darkness."
p191
aVAnd that guy's like, "Actually, it was 87.3 miles."
p192
aVAnd you're like, "Actually, shut up!
p193
aVI'm just trying to tell a story."
p194
aa(lp195
VBecause good storytelling is all about emotional connection.
p196
aVWe have to convince our audience
p197
aVthat what we're talking about matters.
p198
aVBut just as important is knowing
p199
aVwhich details we should leave out
p200
aVso that the main point still comes across.
p201
aVI'm reminded of what the architect Mies van der Rohe said,
p202
aVand I paraphrase, when he said that sometimes
p203
aVyou have to lie in order to tell the truth.
p204
aVI think this sentiment is particularly relevant
p205
aVto science education.
p206
aa(lp207
VNow, finally,
p208
aVI am often so disappointed
p209
aVwhen people think that I'm advocating
p210
aVa dumbing down of science.
p211
aVThat's not true at all.
p212
aVI'm currently a Ph.D. student at MIT,
p213
aVand I absolutely understand the importance of detailed,
p214
aVspecific scientific communication between experts,
p215
aVbut not when we're trying to teach 13-year-olds.
p216
aVIf a young learner thinks that all viruses have DNA,
p217
aVthat's not going to ruin their chances of success in science.
p218
aVBut if a young learner can't understand anything in science
p219
aVand learns to hate it because it all sounds like this,
p220
aVthat will ruin their chances of success.
p221
aa(lp222
VThis needs to stop,
p223
aVand I wish that the change could come from the institutions
p224
aVat the top that are perpetuating these problems,
p225
aVand I beg them, I beseech them to just stop it.
p226
aVBut I think that's unlikely.
p227
aVSo we are so lucky that we have resources
p228
aVlike the Internet, where we can circumvent these institutions
p229
aVfrom the bottom up.
p230
aVThere's a growing number of online resources
p231
aVthat are dedicated to just explaining science
p232
aVin simple, understandable ways.
p233
aVI dream of a Wikipedia-like website that would explain
p234
aVany scientific concept you can think of
p235
aVin simple language any middle schooler can understand.
p236
aVAnd I myself spend most of my free time
p237
aVmaking these science videos that I put on YouTube.
p238
aVI explain chemical equilibrium using analogies
p239
aVto awkward middle school dances,
p240
aVand I talk about fuel cells with stories
p241
aVabout boys and girls at a summer camp.
p242
aVThe feedback that I get is sometimes misspelled
p243
aVand it's often written in LOLcats,
p244
aVbut nonetheless
p245
aVit's so appreciative, so thankful
p246
aVthat I know this is the right way
p247
aVwe should be communicating science.
p248
aa(lp249
VThere's still so much work left to be done, though,
p250
aVand if you're involved with science in any way
p251
aVI urge you to join me.
p252
aVPick up a camera, start to write a blog, whatever,
p253
aVbut leave out the seriousness, leave out the jargon.
p254
aVMake me laugh. Make me care.
p255
aVLeave out those annoying details that nobody cares about
p256
aVand just get to the point.
p257
aVHow should you start?
p258
aVWhy don't you say, "Listen, let me tell you a story"?
p259
aa(lp260
VThank you.
