VWhen I opened Mott Hall Bridges Academy in 2010,
p4
aVmy goal was simple:
p5
aVopen a school to close a prison.
p6
aVNow to some, this was an audacious goal,
p7
aVbecause our school is located in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn \u2014
p8
aVone of the most underserved and violent neighborhoods
p9
aVin all of New York City.
p10
aVLike many urban schools with high poverty rates,
p11
aVwe face numerous challenges,
p12
aVlike finding teachers who can empathize
p13
aVwith the complexities of a disadvantaged community,
p14
aVlack of funding for technology,
p15
aVlow parental involvement
p16
aVand neighborhood gangs that recruit children as early as fourth grade.
p17
aa(lp18
VSo here I was,
p19
aVthe founding principal of a middle school that was a district public school,
p20
aVand I only had 45 kids to start.
p21
aVThirty percent of them had special needs.
p22
aVEighty-six percent of them were below grade level
p23
aVin English and in math.
p24
aVAnd 100 percent were living below the poverty level.
p25
aa(lp26
VIf our children are not in our classrooms,
p27
aVhow will they learn?
p28
aVAnd if they're not learning,
p29
aVwhere would they end up?
p30
aa(lp31
VIt was evident when I would ask my 13-year-old,
p32
aV"Young man,
p33
aVwhere do you see yourself in five years?"
p34
aa(lp35
VAnd his response:
p36
aV"I don't know if I'm gonna live that long."
p37
aa(lp38
VOr to have a young woman say to me
p39
aVthat she had a lifelong goal of working in a fast-food restaurant.
p40
aVTo me, this was unacceptable.
p41
aVIt was also evident that they had no idea
p42
aVthat there was a landscape of opportunity
p43
aVthat existed beyond their neighborhood.
p44
aa(lp45
VWe call our students "scholars," because they're lifelong learners.
p46
aVAnd the skills that they learn today
p47
aVwill prepare them for college and career readiness.
p48
aVI chose the royal colors of purple and black,
p49
aVbecause I want them to be reminded that they are descendants of greatness,
p50
aVand that through education,
p51
aVthey are future engineers,
p52
aVscientists,
p53
aVentrepreneurs
p54
aVand even leaders who can and will take over this world.
p55
aVTo date,
p56
aVwe have had three graduating classes,
p57
aVat a 98 \u2014
p58
aa(lp59
V(Applause)
p60
aa(lp61
VAt a 98-percent graduation rate.
p62
aVThis is nearly 200 children,
p63
aVwho are now going to some of the most competitive high schools
p64
aVin New York City.
p65
aa(lp66
V(Applause)
p67
aa(lp68
VIt was a cold day in January
p69
aVwhen my scholar, Vidal Chastanet, met Brandon Stanton,
p70
aVthe founder of the popular blog "Humans of New York."
p71
aVBrandon shared the story of a young man from Brownsville
p72
aVwho had witnessed violence firsthand,
p73
aVby witnessing a man being thrown off of a roof.
p74
aVYet he can still be influenced by a principal
p75
aVwho had opened up a school that believes in all children.
p76
aVVidal embodies the story of so many of our underprivileged children
p77
aVwho are struggling to survive,
p78
aVwhich is why we must make education a priority.
p79
aa(lp80
VBrandon's post created a global sensation
p81
aVthat touched the lives of millions.
p82
aVThis resulted in 1.4 million dollars being raised
p83
aVfor our scholars to attend field trips to colleges and universities,
p84
aVSummer STEAM programs,
p85
aVas well as college scholarships.
p86
aVYou need to understand
p87
aVthat when 200 young people from Brownsville visited Harvard,
p88
aVthey now understood
p89
aVthat a college of their choice was a real possibility.
p90
aVAnd the impossibilities that had been imposed upon them
p91
aVby a disadvantaged community
p92
aVwere replaced by hope and purpose.
p93
aa(lp94
VThe revolution in education is happening in our schools,
p95
aVwith adults who provide love,
p96
aVstructure,
p97
aVsupport
p98
aVand knowledge.
p99
aVThese are the things that inspire children.
p100
aVBut it is not an easy task.
p101
aVAnd there are high demands
p102
aVwithin an education system that is not perfect.
p103
aa(lp104
VBut I have a dynamic group of educators
p105
aVwho collaborate as a team to determine what is the best curriculum.
p106
aVThey take time beyond their school day,
p107
aVand come in on weekends
p108
aVand even use their own money to often provide resources
p109
aVwhen we do not have it.
p110
aVAnd as the principal,
p111
aVI have to inspect what I expect.
p112
aa(lp113
VSo I show up in classes
p114
aVand I conduct observations to give feedback,
p115
aVbecause I want my teachers to be just as successful
p116
aVas the name Mott Hall Bridges Academy.
p117
aVAnd I give them access to me every single day,
p118
aVwhich is why they all have my personal cell number,
p119
aVincluding my scholars and those who graduated \u2014
p120
aVwhich is probably why I get phone calls and text messages
p121
aVat three o'clock in the morning.
p122
aa(lp123
V(Laughter)
p124
aa(lp125
VBut we are all connected to succeed,
p126
aVand good leaders do this.
p127
aVTomorrow's future is sitting in our classrooms.
p128
aVAnd they are our responsibility.
p129
aVThat means everyone in here,
p130
aVand those who are watching the screen.
p131
aVWe must believe in their brilliance,
p132
aVand remind them by teaching them
p133
aVthat there indeed is power in education.
p134
aa(lp135
VThank you.
