VTwenty-five years ago, scientists at CERN created the World Wide Web.
p4
aVSince then, the Internet has transformed  the way we communicate,
p5
aVthe way we do business, and even the way we live.
p6
aVIn many ways,
p7
aVthe ideas that gave birth to Google, Facebook, Twitter, and so many others,
p8
aVhave now really transformed our lives,
p9
aVand this has brought us many real benefits such as a more connected society.
p10
aVHowever, there are also some downsides to this.
p11
aVToday, the average person has an astounding amount
p12
aVof personal information online,
p13
aVand we add to this online information every single time we post on Facebook,
p14
aVeach time we search on Google,
p15
aVand each time we send an email.
p16
aa(lp17
VNow, many of us probably think,
p18
aVwell, one email, there's nothing in there, right?
p19
aVBut if you consider a year's worth of emails,
p20
aVor maybe even a lifetime of email,
p21
aVcollectively, this tells a lot.
p22
aVIt tells where we have been, who we have met,
p23
aVand in many ways, even what we're thinking about.
p24
aVAnd the more scary part about this is our data now lasts forever,
p25
aVso your data can and will outlive you.
p26
aVWhat has happened is that we've largely lost control over our data
p27
aVand also our privacy.
p28
aa(lp29
VSo this year, as the web turns 25,
p30
aVit's very important for us to take a moment
p31
aVand think about the implications of this.
p32
aVWe have to really think.
p33
aVWe've lost privacy, yes,
p34
aVbut actually what we've also lost is the idea of privacy itself.
p35
aVIf you think about it,
p36
aVmost of us here today probably remember  what life was like before the Internet,
p37
aVbut today, there's a new generation
p38
aVthat is being taught from a very young age to share everything online,
p39
aVand this is a generation that is not  going to remember when data was private.
p40
aVSo we keep going down this road, 20 years from now,
p41
aVthe word 'privacy' is going to have a completely different meaning
p42
aVfrom what it means to you and I.
p43
aa(lp44
VSo, it's time for us  to take a moment and think,
p45
aVis there anything we can do about this?
p46
aVAnd I believe there is.
p47
aa(lp48
VLet's take a look at one of the most widely used forms of communication
p49
aVin the world today: email.
p50
aVBefore the invention of email, we largely communicated using letters,
p51
aVand the process was quite simple.
p52
aVYou would first start by writing your message on a piece of paper,
p53
aVthen you would place it into a sealed envelope,
p54
aVand from there, you would go ahead and send it
p55
aVafter you put a stamp and address on it.
p56
aVUnfortunately, today,
p57
aVwhen we actually send an email, we're not sending a letter.
p58
aVWhat you are sending, in many ways, is actually a postcard,
p59
aVand it's a postcard in the sense that everybody that sees it
p60
aVfrom the time it leaves your computer to when it gets to the recipient
p61
aVcan actually read the entire contents.
p62
aa(lp63
VSo, the solution to this has been known for some time,
p64
aVand there's many attempts to do it.
p65
aVThe most basic solution is to use encryption,
p66
aVand the idea is quite simple.
p67
aVFirst, you encrypt the connection
p68
aVbetween your computer and the email server.
p69
aVThen, you also encrypt the data as it sits on the server itself.
p70
aVBut there's a problem with this,
p71
aVand that is, the email servers also hold the encryption keys,
p72
aVso now you have a really big lock with a key placed right next to it.
p73
aVBut not only that, any government could lawfully ask for
p74
aVand get the key to your data,
p75
aVand this is all without you being aware of it.
p76
aa(lp77
VSo the way we fix this problem is actually relatively easy, in principle:
p78
aVYou give everybody their own keys,
p79
aVand then you make sure the server doesn't actually have the keys.
p80
aVThis seems like common sense, right?
p81
aVSo the question that comes up is, why hasn't this been done yet?
p82
aa(lp83
VWell, if we really think about it,
p84
aVwe see that the business model of the Internet today
p85
aVreally isn't compatible with privacy.
p86
aVJust take a look at some of the biggest names on the web,
p87
aVand you see that advertising plays a huge role.
p88
aVIn fact, this year alone, advertising is 137 billion dollars,
p89
aVand to optimize the ads that are shown to us,
p90
aVcompanies have to know everything about us.
p91
aVThey need to know where we live,
p92
aVhow old we are, what we like, what we don't like,
p93
aVand anything else they can get their hands on.
p94
aVAnd if you think about it,
p95
aVthe best way to get this information is really just to invade our privacy.
p96
aVSo these companies aren't going to give us our privacy.
p97
aVIf we want to have privacy online,
p98
aVwhat we have to do is we've got to go out and get it ourselves.
p99
aa(lp100
VFor many years, when it came to email,
p101
aVthe only solution was something known as PGP,
p102
aVwhich was quite complicated and only accessible to the tech-savvy.
p103
aVHere's a diagram that basically shows
p104
aVthe process for encrypting and decrypting messages.
p105
aVSo needless to say, this is not a solution for everybody,
p106
aVand this actually is part of the problem,
p107
aVbecause if you think about communication,
p108
aVby definition, it involves having someone to communicate with.
p109
aVSo while PGP does a great job of what it's designed to do,
p110
aVfor the people out there who can't understand how to use it,
p111
aVthe option to communicate privately simply does not exist.
p112
aVAnd this is a problem that we need to solve.
p113
aVSo if we want to have privacy online,
p114
aVthe only way we can succeed is if we get the whole world on board,
p115
aVand this is only possible if we bring down the barrier to entry.
p116
aVI think this is actually the key challenge that lies in the tech community.
p117
aVWhat we really have to do is work and make privacy more accessible.
p118
aa(lp119
VSo last summer, when the Edward Snowden story came out,
p120
aVseveral colleagues and I decided to see if we could make this happen.
p121
aVAt that time, we were working at the European Organization for Nuclear Research
p122
aVat the world's largest particle collider, which collides protons, by the way.
p123
aVWe were all scientists, so we used our scientific creativity
p124
aVand came up with a very creative name for our project:
p125
aVProtonMail. (Laughter)
p126
aVMany startups these days actually begin in people's garages
p127
aVor people's basements.
p128
aVWe were a bit different.
p129
aVWe started out at the CERN cafeteria,
p130
aVwhich actually is great, because look,
p131
aVyou have all the food and water you could ever want.
p132
aVBut even better than this is that every day
p133
aVbetween 12 p.m. and 2 p.m., free of charge,
p134
aVthe CERN cafeteria comes with several thousand scientists and engineers,
p135
aVand these guys basically know the answers to everything.
p136
aVSo it was in this environment that we began working.
p137
aVWhat we actually want to do is we want to take your email
p138
aVand turn it into something that looks more like this,
p139
aVbut more importantly, we want to do it in a way
p140
aVthat you can't even tell that it's happened.
p141
aVSo to do this, we actually need a combination of technology
p142
aVand also design.
p143
aa(lp144
VSo how do we go about doing something like this?
p145
aVWell, it's probably a good idea not to put the keys on the server.
p146
aVSo what we do is we generate encryption keys on your computer,
p147
aVand we don't generate a single key, but actually a pair of keys,
p148
aVso there's an RSA private key and an RSA public key,
p149
aVand these keys are mathematically connected.
p150
aa(lp151
VSo let's have a look and see how this works
p152
aVwhen multiple people communicate.
p153
aVSo here we have Bob and Alice, who want to communicate privately.
p154
aVSo the key challenge is to take Bob's message
p155
aVand to get it to Alice in such a way that the server cannot read that message.
p156
aVSo what we have to do is we have to encrypt it
p157
aVbefore it even leaves Bob's computer,
p158
aVand one of the tricks is, we encrypt it using the public key from Alice.
p159
aVNow this encrypted data is sent through the server to Alice,
p160
aVand because the message was encrypted using Alice's public key,
p161
aVthe only key that can now decrypt it is a private key that belongs to Alice,
p162
aVand it turns out Alice is the only person that actually has this key.
p163
aVSo we've now accomplished the objective,
p164
aVwhich is to get the message from Bob to Alice
p165
aVwithout the server being able to read what's going on.
p166
aa(lp167
VActually, what I've shown here is a highly simplified picture.
p168
aVThe reality is much more complex
p169
aVand it requires a lot of software that looks a bit like this.
p170
aVAnd that's actually the key design challenge:
p171
aVHow do we take all this complexity, all this software,
p172
aVand implement it in a way that the user cannot see it.
p173
aVI think with ProtonMail, we have gotten pretty close to doing this.
p174
aa(lp175
VSo let's see how it works in practice.
p176
aVHere, we've got Bob and Alice again,
p177
aVwho also want to communicate securely.
p178
aVThey simply create accounts on ProtonMail,
p179
aVwhich is quite simple and takes a few moments,
p180
aVand all the key encryption and generation
p181
aVis happening automatically in the background
p182
aVas Bob is creating his account.
p183
aVOnce his account is created, he just clicks "compose,"
p184
aVand now he can write his email like he does today.
p185
aVSo he fills in his information,
p186
aVand then after that,  all he has to do is click "send,"
p187
aVand just like that, without understanding cryptography,
p188
aVand without doing anything different from how he writes email today,
p189
aVBob has just sent an encrypted message.
p190
aa(lp191
VWhat we have here is really just the first step,
p192
aVbut it shows that with improving technology,
p193
aVprivacy doesn't have to be difficult, it doesn't have to be disruptive.
p194
aVIf we change the goal from maximizing  ad revenue to protecting data,
p195
aVwe can actually make it accessible.
p196
aVNow, I know a question on everybody's minds is,
p197
aVokay, protecting privacy, this is a great goal,
p198
aVbut can you actually do this
p199
aVwithout the tons of money that advertisements give you?
p200
aVAnd I think the answer is actually yes,
p201
aVbecause today, we've reached a point
p202
aVwhere people around the world really understand how important privacy is,
p203
aVand when you have that, anything is possible.
p204
aVEarlier this year,
p205
aVProtonMail actually had so many users  that we ran out of resources,
p206
aVand when this happened, our community of users got together
p207
aVand donated half a million dollars.
p208
aVSo this is just an example of what can happen
p209
aVwhen you bring the community together towards a common goal.
p210
aVWe can also leverage the world.
p211
aVRight now,
p212
aVwe have a quarter of a million people that have signed up for ProtonMail,
p213
aVand these people come from everywhere,
p214
aVand this really shows that privacy
p215
aVis not just an American or a European issue,
p216
aVit's a global issue that impacts all of us.
p217
aVIt's something that we really have to pay attention to going forward.
p218
aa(lp219
VSo what do we have to do to solve this problem?
p220
aVWell, first of all,
p221
aVwe need to support a different business model for the Internet,
p222
aVone that does not rely entirely on advertisements
p223
aVfor revenue and for growth.
p224
aVWe actually need to build a new Internet
p225
aVwhere our privacy and our ability  to control our data is first and foremost.
p226
aVBut even more importantly,
p227
aVwe have to build an Internet  where privacy is no longer just an option
p228
aVbut is also the default.
p229
aa(lp230
VWe have done the first step with ProtonMail,
p231
aVbut this is really just the first step in a very, very long journey.
p232
aVThe good news I can share with you guys today,
p233
aVthe exciting news, is that we're not traveling alone.
p234
aVThe movement to protect people's privacy and freedom online
p235
aVis really gaining momentum,
p236
aVand today, there are dozens of projects from all around the world
p237
aVwho are working together to improve our privacy.
p238
aVThese projects protect things from our chat to voice communications,
p239
aValso our file storage, our online search,
p240
aVour online browsing, and many other things.
p241
aVAnd these projects are not backed by billions of dollars in advertising,
p242
aVbut they've found support really from the people,
p243
aVfrom private individuals like you and I from all over the world.
p244
aa(lp245
VThis really matters, because ultimately,
p246
aVprivacy depends on each and every one of us,
p247
aVand we have to protect it now because our online data
p248
aVis more than just a collection of ones and zeros.
p249
aVIt's actually a lot more than that.
p250
aVIt's our lives, our personal stories,
p251
aVour friends, our families,
p252
aVand in many ways, also our hopes and our aspirations.
p253
aVWe need to spend time now to really protect our right
p254
aVto share this only with people that we want to share this with,
p255
aVbecause without this, we simply can't have a free society.
p256
aVSo now's the time for us to collectively stand up and say,
p257
aVyes, we do want to live in a world with online privacy,
p258
aVand yes, we can work together to turn this vision into a reality.
p259
