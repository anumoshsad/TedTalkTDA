VHi, I'm an engineer
p4
aVand I make robots.
p5
aVNow, of course you all know what a robot is, right?
p6
aVIf you don't, you'd probably go to Google,
p7
aVand you'd ask Google what a robot is.
p8
aVSo let's do that.
p9
aVWe'll go to Google and this is what we get.
p10
aVNow, you can see here there are lots of different types of robots,
p11
aVbut they're predominantly humanoid in structure.
p12
aVAnd they look pretty conventional
p13
aVbecause they've got plastic, they've got metal,
p14
aVthey've got motors and gears and so on.
p15
aVSome of them look quite friendly,
p16
aVand you could go up and you could hug them.
p17
aVSome of them not so friendly,
p18
aVthey look like they're straight out of "Terminator,"
p19
aVin fact they may well be straight out of "Terminator."
p20
aVYou can do lots of really cool things with these robots \u2014
p21
aVyou can do really exciting stuff.
p22
aa(lp23
VBut I'd like to look at different kinds of robots \u2014
p24
aVI want to make different kinds of robots.
p25
aVAnd I take inspiration from the things that don't look like us,
p26
aVbut look like these.
p27
aVSo these are natural biological organisms
p28
aVand they do some really cool things that we can't,
p29
aVand current robots can't either.
p30
aVThey do all sorts of great things like moving around on the floor;
p31
aVthey go into our gardens and they eat our crops;
p32
aVthey climb trees;
p33
aVthey go in water, they come out of water;
p34
aVthey trap insects and digest them.
p35
aVSo they do really interesting things.
p36
aVThey live, they breathe, they die,
p37
aVthey eat things from the environment.
p38
aVOur current robots don't really do that.
p39
aVNow, wouldn't it be great
p40
aVif you could use some of those characteristics in future robots
p41
aVso that you could solve some really interesting problems?
p42
aVI'm going to look at a couple of problems now in the environment
p43
aVwhere we can use the skills and the technologies
p44
aVderived from these animals
p45
aVand from the plants,
p46
aVand we can use them to solve those problems.
p47
aa(lp48
VLet's have a look at two environmental problems.
p49
aVThey're both of our making \u2014
p50
aVthis is man interacting with the environment
p51
aVand doing some rather unpleasant things.
p52
aVThe first one is to do with the pressure of population.
p53
aVSuch is the pressure of population around the world
p54
aVthat agriculture and farming is required to produce more and more crops.
p55
aVNow, to do that,
p56
aVfarmers put more and more chemicals onto the land.
p57
aVThey put on fertilizers, nitrates, pesticides \u2014
p58
aVall sorts of things that encourage the growth of the crops,
p59
aVbut there are some negative impacts.
p60
aVOne of the negative impacts is if you put lots of fertilizer on the land,
p61
aVnot all of it goes into the crops.
p62
aVLots of it stays in the soil,
p63
aVand then when it rains,
p64
aVthese chemicals go into the water table.
p65
aVAnd in the water table,
p66
aVthen they go into streams, into lakes, into rivers
p67
aVand into the sea.
p68
aVNow, if you put all of these chemicals, these nitrates,
p69
aVinto those kinds of environments,
p70
aVthere are organisms in those environments that will be affected by that \u2014
p71
aValgae, for example.
p72
aVAlgae loves nitrates, it loves fertilizer,
p73
aVso it will take in all these chemicals,
p74
aVand if the conditions are right, it will mass produce.
p75
aVIt will produce masses and masses of new algae.
p76
aVThat's called a bloom.
p77
aVThe trouble is that when algae reproduces like this,
p78
aVit starves the water of oxygen.
p79
aVAs soon as you do that,
p80
aVthe other organisms in the water can't survive.
p81
aVSo, what do we do?
p82
aVWe try to produce a robot that will eat the algae,
p83
aVconsume it and make it safe.
p84
aa(lp85
VSo that's the first problem.
p86
aVThe second problem is also of our making,
p87
aVand it's to do with oil pollution.
p88
aVNow, oil comes out of the engines that we use,
p89
aVthe boats that we use.
p90
aVSometimes tankers flush their oil tanks into the sea,
p91
aVso oil is released into the sea that way.
p92
aVWouldn't it be nice if we could treat that in some way
p93
aVusing robots that could eat the pollution the oil fields have produced?
p94
aVSo that's what we do.
p95
aVWe make robots that will eat pollution.
p96
aa(lp97
VTo actually make the robot,
p98
aVwe take inspiration from two organisms.
p99
aVOn the right there you see the basking shark.
p100
aVThe basking shark is a massive shark.
p101
aVIt's noncarnivorous, so you can swim with it,
p102
aVas you can see.
p103
aVAnd the basking shark opens its mouth,
p104
aVand it swims through the water, collecting plankton.
p105
aVAs it does that, it digests the food,
p106
aVand then it uses that energy in its body to keep moving.
p107
aVSo, could we make a robot like that \u2014
p108
aVlike the basking shark that chugs through the water
p109
aVand eats up pollution?
p110
aVWell, let's see if we can do that.
p111
aVBut also, we take the inspiration from other organisms.
p112
aVI've got a picture here of a water boatman,
p113
aVand the water boatman is really cute.
p114
aVWhen it's swimming in the water,
p115
aVit uses its paddle-like legs to push itself forward.
p116
aa(lp117
VSo we take those two organisms
p118
aVand we combine them together to make a new kind of robot.
p119
aVIn fact, because we're using the water boatman as inspiration,
p120
aVand our robot sits on top of the water,
p121
aVand it rows,
p122
aVwe call it the "Row-bot."
p123
aVSo a Row-bot is a robot that rows.
p124
aVOK. So what does it look like?
p125
aVHere's some pictures of the Row-bot,
p126
aVand you'll see,
p127
aVit doesn't look anything like the robots we saw right at the beginning.
p128
aVGoogle is wrong; robots don't look like that,
p129
aVthey look like this.
p130
aa(lp131
VSo I've got the Row-bot here.
p132
aVI'll just hold it up for you.
p133
aVIt gives you a sense of the scale,
p134
aVand it doesn't look anything like the others.
p135
aVOK, so it's made out of plastic,
p136
aVand we'll have a look now at the components
p137
aVthat make up the Row-bot \u2014
p138
aVwhat makes it really special.
p139
aa(lp140
VThe Row-bot is made up of three parts,
p141
aVand those three parts are really like the parts of any organism.
p142
aVIt's got a brain,
p143
aVit's got a body
p144
aVand it's got a stomach.
p145
aVIt needs the stomach to create the energy.
p146
aVAny Row-bot will have those three components,
p147
aVand any organism will have those three components,
p148
aVso let's go through them one at a time.
p149
aVIt has a body,
p150
aVand its body is made out of plastic,
p151
aVand it sits on top of the water.
p152
aVAnd it's got flippers on the side here \u2014
p153
aVpaddles that help it move,
p154
aVjust like the water boatman.
p155
aVIt's got a plastic body,
p156
aVbut it's got a soft rubber mouth here,
p157
aVand a mouth here \u2014 it's got two mouths.
p158
aVWhy does it have two mouths?
p159
aVOne is to let the food go in
p160
aVand the other is to let the food go out.
p161
aVSo you can see really it's got a mouth and a derriere,
p162
aVor a \u2014
p163
aa(lp164
V(Laughter)
p165
aa(lp166
Vsomething where the stuff comes out,
p167
aVwhich is just like a real organism.
p168
aVSo it's starting to look like that basking shark.
p169
aVSo that's the body.
p170
aa(lp171
VThe second component might be the stomach.
p172
aVWe need to get the energy into the robot and we need to treat the pollution,
p173
aVso the pollution goes in,
p174
aVand it will do something.
p175
aVIt's got a cell in the middle here called a microbial fuel cell.
p176
aVI'll put this down, and I'll lift up the fuel cell.
p177
aVHere. So instead of having batteries,
p178
aVinstead of having a conventional power system,
p179
aVit's got one of these.
p180
aVThis is its stomach.
p181
aVAnd it really is a stomach
p182
aVbecause you can put energy in this side in the form of pollution,
p183
aVand it creates electricity.
p184
aa(lp185
VSo what is it?
p186
aVIt's called a microbial fuel cell.
p187
aVIt's a little bit like a chemical fuel cell,
p188
aVwhich you might have come across in school,
p189
aVor you might've seen in the news.
p190
aVChemical fuel cells take hydrogen and oxygen,
p191
aVand they can combine them together and you get electricity.
p192
aVThat's well-established technology; it was in the Apollo space missions.
p193
aVThat's from 40, 50 years ago.
p194
aVThis is slightly newer.
p195
aVThis is a microbial fuel cell.
p196
aVIt's the same principle:
p197
aVit's got oxygen on one side,
p198
aVbut instead of having hydrogen on the other,
p199
aVit's got some soup,
p200
aVand inside that soup there are living microbes.
p201
aVNow, if you take some organic material \u2014
p202
aVcould be some waste products, some food,
p203
aVmaybe a bit of your sandwich \u2014
p204
aVyou put it in there, the microbes will eat that food,
p205
aVand they will turn it into electricity.
p206
aVNot only that, but if you select the right kind of microbes,
p207
aVyou can use the microbial fuel cell to treat some of the pollution.
p208
aVIf you choose the right microbes,
p209
aVthe microbes will eat the algae.
p210
aVIf you use other kinds of microbes,
p211
aVthey will eat petroleum spirits and crude oil.
p212
aVSo you can see how this stomach could be used
p213
aVto not only treat the pollution
p214
aVbut also to generate electricity from the pollution.
p215
aVSo the robot will move through the environment,
p216
aVtaking food into its stomach,
p217
aVdigest the food, create electricity,
p218
aVuse that electricity to move through the environment
p219
aVand keep doing this.
p220
aa(lp221
VOK, so let's see what happens when we run the Row-bot \u2014
p222
aVwhen it does some rowing.
p223
aVHere we've got a couple of videos,
p224
aVthe first thing you'll see \u2014 hopefully you can see here
p225
aVis the mouth open.
p226
aVThe front mouth and the bottom mouth open,
p227
aVand it will stay opened enough,
p228
aVthen the robot will start to row forward.
p229
aVIt moves through the water
p230
aVso that food goes in as the waste products go out.
p231
aVOnce it's moved enough,
p232
aVit stops and then it closes the mouth \u2014
p233
aVslowly closes the mouths \u2014
p234
aVand then it will sit there,
p235
aVand it will digest the food.
p236
aa(lp237
VOf course these microbial fuel cells,
p238
aVthey contain microbes.
p239
aVWhat you really want is lots of energy
p240
aVcoming out of those microbes as quickly as possible.
p241
aVBut we can't force the microbes
p242
aVand they generate a small amount of electricity per second.
p243
aVThey generate milliwatts, or microwatts.
p244
aVLet's put that into context.
p245
aVYour mobile phone for example,
p246
aVone of these modern ones,
p247
aVif you use it, it takes about one watt.
p248
aVSo that's a thousand or a million times as much energy that that uses
p249
aVcompared to the microbial fuel cell.
p250
aVHow can we cope with that?
p251
aVWell, when the Row-bot has done its digestion,
p252
aVwhen it's taken the food in,
p253
aVit will sit there and it will wait until it has consumed all that food.
p254
aVThat could take some hours, it could take some days.
p255
aVA typical cycle for the Row-bot looks like this:
p256
aVyou open your mouth,
p257
aVyou move,
p258
aVyou close your mouth
p259
aVand you sit there for a while waiting.
p260
aVOnce you digest your food,
p261
aVthen you can go about doing the same thing again.
p262
aVBut you know what, that looks like a real organism, doesn't it?
p263
aVIt looks like the kind of thing we do.
p264
aVSaturday night, we go out, open our mouths,
p265
aVfill our stomachs,
p266
aVsit in front of the telly and digest.
p267
aVWhen we've had enough, we do the same thing again.
p268
aa(lp269
VOK, if we're lucky with this cycle,
p270
aVat the end of the cycle we'll have enough energy left over
p271
aVfor us to be able to do something else.
p272
aVWe could send a message, for example.
p273
aVWe could send a message saying,
p274
aV"This is how much pollution I've eaten recently,"
p275
aVor, "This is the kind of stuff that I've encountered,"
p276
aVor, "This is where I am."
p277
aVThat ability to send a message saying, "This is where I am,"
p278
aVis really, really important.
p279
aVIf you think about the oil slicks that we saw before,
p280
aVor those massive algal blooms,
p281
aVwhat you really want to do is put your Row-bot out there,
p282
aVand it eats up all of those pollutions,
p283
aVand then you have to go collect them.
p284
aVWhy?
p285
aVBecause these Row-bots at the moment,
p286
aVthis Row-bot I've got here,
p287
aVit contains motors, it contains wires,
p288
aVit contains components which themselves are not biodegradable.
p289
aVCurrent Row-bots contain things like toxic batteries.
p290
aVYou can't leave those in the environment,
p291
aVso you need to track them,
p292
aVand then when they've finished their job of work,
p293
aVyou need to collect them.
p294
aVThat limits the number of Row-bots you can use.
p295
aVIf, on the other hand,
p296
aVyou have robot a little bit like a biological organism,
p297
aVwhen it comes to the end of its life,
p298
aVit dies and it degrades to nothing.
p299
aa(lp300
VSo wouldn't it be nice if these robots,
p301
aVinstead of being like this, made out of plastic,
p302
aVwere made out of other materials,
p303
aVwhich when you throw them out there,
p304
aVthey biodegrade to nothing?
p305
aVThat changes the way in which we use robots.
p306
aVInstead of putting 10 or 100 out into the environment,
p307
aVhaving to track them,
p308
aVand then when they die,
p309
aVcollect them,
p310
aVyou could put a thousand,
p311
aVa million, a billion robots into the environment.
p312
aVJust spread them around.
p313
aVYou know that at the end of their lives, they're going to degrade to nothing.
p314
aVYou don't need to worry about them.
p315
aVSo that changes the way in which you think about robots
p316
aVand the way you deploy them.
p317
aa(lp318
VThen the question is: Can you do this?
p319
aVWell, yes, we have shown that you can do this.
p320
aVYou can make robots which are biodegradable.
p321
aVWhat's really interesting is you can use household materials
p322
aVto make these biodegradable robots.
p323
aVI'll show you some; you might be surprised.
p324
aVYou can make a robot out of jelly.
p325
aVInstead of having a motor, which we have at the moment,
p326
aVyou can make things called artificial muscles.
p327
aVArtificial muscles are smart materials,
p328
aVyou apply electricity to them,
p329
aVand they contract, or they bend or they twist.
p330
aVThey look like real muscles.
p331
aVSo instead of having a motor, you have these artificial muscles.
p332
aVAnd you can make artificial muscles out of jelly.
p333
aVIf you take some jelly and some salts,
p334
aVand do a bit of jiggery-pokery,
p335
aVyou can make an artificial muscle.
p336
aa(lp337
VWe've also shown you can make the microbial fuel cell's stomach
p338
aVout of paper.
p339
aVSo you could make the whole robot out of biodegradable materials.
p340
aVYou throw them out there, and they degrade to nothing.
p341
aa(lp342
VWell, this is really, really exciting.
p343
aVIt's going to totally change the way in which we think about robots,
p344
aVbut also it allows you to be really creative
p345
aVin the way in which you think about what you can do with these robots.
p346
aVI'll give you an example.
p347
aVIf you can use jelly to make a robot \u2014
p348
aVnow, we eat jelly, right?
p349
aVSo, why not make something like this?
p350
aVA robot gummy bear.
p351
aVHere, I've got some I prepared earlier.
p352
aVThere we go. I've got a packet \u2014
p353
aVand I've got a lemon-flavored one.
p354
aVI'll take this gummy bear \u2014 he's not robotic, OK?
p355
aVWe have to pretend.
p356
aVAnd what you do with one of these is you put it in your mouth \u2014
p357
aVthe lemon's quite nice.
p358
aVTry not to chew it too much, it's a robot, it may not like it.
p359
aVAnd then you swallow it.
p360
aVAnd then it goes into your stomach.
p361
aVAnd when it's inside your stomach, it moves, it thinks, it twists, it bends,
p362
aVit does something.
p363
aVIt could go further down into your intestines,
p364
aVfind out whether you've got some ulcer or cancer,
p365
aVmaybe do an injection, something like that.
p366
aVYou know that once it's done its job of work,
p367
aVit could be consumed by your stomach,
p368
aVor if you don't want that,
p369
aVit could go straight through you,
p370
aVinto the toilet,
p371
aVand be degraded safely in the environment.
p372
aVSo this changes the way, again, in which we think about robots.
p373
aa(lp374
VSo, we started off looking at robots that would eat pollution,
p375
aVand then we're looking at robots which we can eat.
p376
aVI hope this gives you some idea
p377
aVof the kinds of things we can do with future robots.
p378
aa(lp379
VThank you very much for your attention.
