VDo you remember these glow-in-the-dark little stars
p4
aVwhich you had on the ceiling when you were a boy or a girl?
p5
aVYes?
p6
aVIt is light.
p7
aVIt is pure light.
p8
aVI think I stared at them way too long
p9
aVwhen I was a five-year-old, you know?
p10
aVIt's so beautiful:
p11
aVno energy bill, no maintenance.
p12
aVIt is there.
p13
aa(lp14
VSo two years ago, we went back to the lab,
p15
aVmaking it more durable, more light-emitting,
p16
aVwith the experts.
p17
aVAnd at the same time, we got a request from this guy \u2014
p18
aVVan Gogh, the famous Van Gogh Foundation \u2014
p19
aVwho wanted to celebrate his 125th anniversary in the Netherlands.
p20
aVAnd they came to me and asked,
p21
aV"Can you make a place where he feels more alive again
p22
aVin the Netherlands?"
p23
aVAnd I liked that question a lot,
p24
aVso in way,
p25
aVwe sort of started to connect these two different worlds.
p26
aVThis is how my brain works,
p27
aVby the way.
p28
aa(lp29
V(Laughter)
p30
aa(lp31
VI would love to keep on doing this for an hour,
p32
aVbut OK \u2014
p33
aa(lp34
V(Laughter)
p35
aa(lp36
VAnd this is the result that we made:
p37
aVa bicycle path which charges at daytime via the sun
p38
aVand glows at night, up to eight hours.
p39
aa(lp40
V(Applause)
p41
aa(lp42
VThank you.
p43
aa(lp44
V... hinting towards a future which should be energy friendly
p45
aVand linking up the local grounds
p46
aVas Van Gogh literally walked and lived there in 1883.
p47
aVAnd you can go there every night for free, no ticket needed.
p48
aVPeople experience the beauty of cycling through the starry night,
p49
aVthinking about green energy and safety.
p50
aa(lp51
VI want to create places where people feel connected again.
p52
aVAnd it was somehow great to make these projects happen
p53
aVwith the industry, with the infrastructure companies.
p54
aVSo when these sheikhs of Qatar started to call:
p55
aV"How much for 10 kilometers?"
p56
aa(lp57
V(Laughter)
p58
aa(lp59
VYeah, really, that's a weird call you're going to get.
p60
aVBut it's fascinating
p61
aVthat this is not just a sort of one-off, nice-to-have special.
p62
aVI think this kind of creative thinking, these kinds of connections \u2014
p63
aVit's the new economy.
p64
aa(lp65
VThe World Economic Forum, the think tank in Geneva,
p66
aVdid an interview with a lot of smart people
p67
aVall around the world,
p68
aVasking, "What are the top 10 skills you and I need to become successful?"
p69
aVAnd what is interesting, what you see here:
p70
aVit's not about money
p71
aVor being really good in C++,
p72
aValthough these are great skills to have, I have to admit.
p73
aVBut look at number three, creativity;
p74
aVnumber two, critical thinking;
p75
aVnumber one, complex problem-solving \u2014
p76
aVall the things a robot or a computer is really bad at.
p77
aVAnd this makes me very optimistic, very hopeful for the new world,
p78
aVthat as we will live in this hyper-technological world,
p79
aVour human skills \u2014
p80
aVour desire for empathy,
p81
aVour desire for curiosity,
p82
aVour desire for beauty \u2014
p83
aVwill be more appreciated again,
p84
aVand we will live in a world where creativity is our true capital.
p85
aa(lp86
VAnd a creative process like that \u2014
p87
aVI don't know how it works for you,
p88
aVbut in my brain, it always starts with a question:
p89
aVWhy?
p90
aVWhy does a jellyfish emit light?
p91
aVOr a firefly?
p92
aVOr why do be accept pollution?
p93
aVThis is from my room in Beijing three years ago.
p94
aVLeft image is a good day \u2014 Saturday.
p95
aVI can see the cars and the people, the birds;
p96
aVlife is OK in a dense urban city.
p97
aVAnd on the right image \u2014
p98
aVholy moly.
p99
aVPollution \u2014 complete layers.
p100
aVI couldn't even see the other side of the city.
p101
aVAnd this image made me really sad.
p102
aVThis is not the bright future we envision here at TED \u2014
p103
aVthis is the horror.
p104
aVWe live five to six years shorter;
p105
aVchildren have lung cancer when they're six years old.
p106
aVAnd so in a weird, beautiful way,
p107
aVI, at that moment, became inspired by Beijing smog.
p108
aa(lp109
VAnd the governments all around the world are fighting their war on smog,
p110
aVbut I wanted to make something within the now.
p111
aVSo we decided to build the largest smog vacuum cleaner
p112
aVin the world.
p113
aVIt sucks up polluted air, cleans it
p114
aVand then releases it.
p115
aVAnd we built the first one.
p116
aVSo it sucks up 30,000 cubic meters per hour,
p117
aVcleans it on the nano level \u2014 the PM2.5, PM10 particles \u2014
p118
aVusing very little electricity,
p119
aVand then releases the clean air,
p120
aVso we have parks, playgrounds, which are 55 to 75 percent more clean
p121
aVthan the rest of the city.
p122
aa(lp123
V(Applause)
p124
aa(lp125
VYes!
p126
aa(lp127
V(Applause)
p128
aa(lp129
VAnd every month or so,
p130
aVit opens like a spaceship \u2014
p131
aVlike a Marilyn Monroe with the \u2014 well, you know what.
p132
aVAnyway.
p133
aa(lp134
V(Laughter)
p135
aa(lp136
VSo this ...
p137
aVthis is the stuff we are capturing.
p138
aVThis is Beijing smog.
p139
aVThis is in our lungs right now.
p140
aVIf you live next to a highway, it's the same as 17 cigarettes per day.
p141
aVAre we insane?
p142
aVWhen did we say yes to that?
p143
aVAnd we had buckets of this disgusting material
p144
aVin our studio,
p145
aVand on a Monday morning, we were discussing, we were like,
p146
aV"Shit, what should we do with it? Should we throw it away?"
p147
aVLike, "Help!"
p148
aVAnd then we realized: no, no, no, no, no \u2014
p149
aVwaste should not exist.
p150
aVWaste for the one should be food for the other.
p151
aVSo, here, maybe show it around.
p152
aVDo not put this in your coffee.
p153
aa(lp154
V(Laughter)
p155
aa(lp156
VAnd we realized that 42 percent is made out of carbon,
p157
aVand carbon, of course, under high pressure,
p158
aVyou get ...
p159
aVdiamonds.
p160
aVSo, inspired by that, we compress it for 30 minutes \u2014
p161
aa(lp162
V(Cracking sound)
p163
aa(lp164
Vand make smog-free rings.
p165
aa(lp166
V(Laughter)
p167
aa(lp168
VAnd so by sharing \u2014 yeah, really!
p169
aVAnd so by sharing a ring,
p170
aVyou donate 1,000 cubic meters of clean air
p171
aVto the city the tower is in.
p172
aa(lp173
V(Applause)
p174
aa(lp175
VI have one here \u2014
p176
aa(lp177
V(Applause)
p178
aa(lp179
VA little floating cube.
p180
aVI will give one to you.
p181
aVI'm not going to propose, don't worry.
p182
aa(lp183
V(Laughter)
p184
aa(lp185
VAre we good?
p186
aVYou can show it around.
p187
aa(lp188
VAnd we put this online \u2014 Kickstarter campaign, crowdfunding.
p189
aVAnd people started to preorder it,
p190
aVbut more importantly, they started to prepay it.
p191
aVSo the finance we made with the jewelry helped us to realize,
p192
aVto build the first tower.
p193
aVAnd that's powerful.
p194
aVSo the waste the activator, it was the enabler.
p195
aVAlso, the feedback from the community \u2014
p196
aVthis is a wedding couple from India,
p197
aVwhere he proposed to her with the smog-free ring
p198
aVas a sign of true beauty,
p199
aVas a sign of hope.
p200
aVAnd she said yes.
p201
aa(lp202
V(Laughter)
p203
aa(lp204
VI love this image so much for a lot of different reasons.
p205
aa(lp206
V(Laughter)
p207
aa(lp208
VAnd right now, the project is touring through China,
p209
aVactually with the support of China's central government.
p210
aVSo the first goal is to create local clean-air parks,
p211
aVand that works already quite well \u2014
p212
aV55, 75 percent more clean.
p213
aVAnd at the same time,
p214
aVwe team up with the NGOs,
p215
aVwith the governors,
p216
aVwith the students,
p217
aVwith the tech people,
p218
aVto say, "Hey, what do we need to do to make a whole city smog-free?"
p219
aVIt's about the dream of clean air.
p220
aVWe do workshops. New ideas pop up.
p221
aVThese are smog-free bicycles which \u2014 I'm Dutch, yes? \u2014
p222
aVI have this "bicycle DNA" inside of me somewhere.
p223
aVAnd so it sucks up polluted air,
p224
aVit cleans it and releases it,
p225
aVin the fight against the car,
p226
aVin the celebration of the bicycle.
p227
aa(lp228
VAnd so right now, we're working on a sort of "package deal," so to speak,
p229
aVwhere we say, "Smog-free towers, smog-free rings."
p230
aVWe go to the mayors or the governors of this world,
p231
aVand say, "We can guarantee a short-term reduction of pollution
p232
aVbetween 20 and 40 percent.
p233
aVPlease sign here right now."
p234
aVYes?
p235
aa(lp236
V(Applause)
p237
aa(lp238
VThank you.
p239
aa(lp240
V(Applause)
p241
aa(lp242
VSo it's all about connecting new technology with creative thinking.
p243
aVAnd if you start thinking about that,
p244
aVthere is so much you can imagine,
p245
aVso much more you can do.
p246
aVWe worked on dance floors which produce electricity
p247
aVwhen you dance on them.
p248
aVWe did the design for that \u2014 2008.
p249
aVSo it moves eight or nine millimeters,
p250
aVproduces 25 watts.
p251
aVThe electricity that we generate is used for the lighting or the DJ booth.
p252
aVSo some of the sustainability is about doing more,
p253
aVnot about doing less.
p254
aa(lp255
VBut also on a larger scale,
p256
aVthe Netherlands, where I'm from, we live below sea level.
p257
aVSo because of these beauties \u2014
p258
aVthe Afsluitdijk: 32 kilometers, built by hand in 1932 \u2014
p259
aVwe live with the water,
p260
aVwe fight with the water,
p261
aVwe try to find harmony,
p262
aVbut sometimes we forget.
p263
aVAnd therefore, we made "Waterlicht,"
p264
aVa combination of LEDs and lenses,
p265
aVwhich show how high the water level would be \u2014
p266
aVglobal change \u2014
p267
aVif we stop.
p268
aVIf, today, we all go home and we say,
p269
aV"Oh, whatever, somebody else will do it for us,"
p270
aVor we'll wait for government or whomever.
p271
aVYou know, we're not going to do that.
p272
aVIt goes wrong.
p273
aVAnd we placed this in public spaces all around the world.
p274
aVThousands of people showed up.
p275
aa(lp276
V(Applause)
p277
aa(lp278
VThank you.
p279
aVYou're too nice, you're too nice. That's not good for a designer.
p280
aa(lp281
VSo thousands of people showed up,
p282
aVand some, actually, were scared.
p283
aVAnd they left; they experienced the floods in 1953.
p284
aVAnd others were mesmerized.
p285
aVCan we make floating cities?
p286
aVCan we generate electricity from the change in tides?
p287
aVSo I think it's so important to make experiences \u2014
p288
aVcollective experiences \u2014
p289
aVwhere people feel connected with a vision, with a future
p290
aVand trigger what is possible.
p291
aa(lp292
VAt the same time,
p293
aVyou know, these kinds of things \u2014 they're not easy, yes?
p294
aVIt's a struggle.
p295
aVAnd what I experienced in my life
p296
aVis that a lot of people say they want innovation,
p297
aVand they want the next and the new, the future.
p298
aVBut the moment you present a new idea,
p299
aVthere's this weird tendency to reply to every new idea
p300
aVstarting with two words.
p301
aVWhich are?
p302
aa(lp303
V(Audience guesses)
p304
aa(lp305
VNo, not "How much?" It's more annoying.
p306
aa(lp307
V(Laughter)
p308
aa(lp309
VWhat is it, guys?
p310
aVOr you're really blessed people? That's really good.
p311
aa(lp312
V"Yes, but." Very good.
p313
aV"Yes, but: it's too expensive, it's too cheap, it's too fast, it's too slow,
p314
aVit's too beautiful, it's too ugly, it cannot be done, it already exists."
p315
aVI heard everything about the same project
p316
aVin the same week.
p317
aVAnd I got really, really annoyed.
p318
aVI got a bit of gray hair, started to dress in black like a true architect.
p319
aa(lp320
V(Laughter)
p321
aa(lp322
VAnd one morning I woke up and I said, "Daan, stop.
p323
aVThis is dragging you down.
p324
aVYou have to do something with this.
p325
aVYou have to use it as an ingredient, as a component."
p326
aVAnd so we decided to build,
p327
aVto realize the famous "Yes, but" chair.
p328
aa(lp329
V(Laughter)
p330
aa(lp331
VAnd this is an existing chair by Friso Kramer, a Dutch design.
p332
aVBut we gave it a little "update,"
p333
aVa little "hack," so to speak.
p334
aVWe placed a little voice-recognition element right here.
p335
aVSo the moment you sit on that chair,
p336
aVand you say those two horrible,
p337
aVcreative-destructive, annoying little words \u2014
p338
aa(lp339
V(Laughter)
p340
aa(lp341
Vyou get a short \u2014
p342
aa(lp343
V(Laughter)
p344
aa(lp345
Vbut pretty intense
p346
aVlittle shock on the back side of your bottom.
p347
aa(lp348
V(Laughter)
p349
aa(lp350
V(Applause)
p351
aa(lp352
VAnd \u2014
p353
aa(lp354
V(Applause)
p355
aa(lp356
Vand that works; yeah, that works.
p357
aVSome clients have left us, they got really mad.
p358
aVFortunately, the good ones have stayed.
p359
aVAnd, of course, we also apply it to ourselves.
p360
aa(lp361
VBut ladies and gentlemen, let's not be afraid.
p362
aVLet's be curious, yes?
p363
aVAnd, you know, walking through TED in these days
p364
aVand hearing the other speakers
p365
aVand feeling the energy of the crowd,
p366
aVI was remembering this quote of the Canadian author, Marshall McLuhan,
p367
aVwho once famously said,
p368
aV"On spacecraft earth,
p369
aVthere are no passengers.
p370
aVWe are all crew."
p371
aVAnd I think this so beautiful.
p372
aVThis is so beautiful!
p373
aVWe're not just consumers; we're makers:
p374
aVwe make decisions,
p375
aVwe make new inventions,
p376
aVwe make new dreams.
p377
aVAnd I think
p378
aVif we start implementing that kind of thinking even more
p379
aVwithin today,
p380
aVthere's still a whole new world to be explored.
p381
aa(lp382
VAll right, thank you.
p383
aa(lp384
V(Applause)
p385
aa(lp386
VThank you.
