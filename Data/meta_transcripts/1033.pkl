VWe are now going through an amazing and unprecedented moment
p4
aVwhere the power dynamics between men and women
p5
aVare shifting very rapidly,
p6
aVand in many of the places where it counts the most,
p7
aVwomen are, in fact, taking control of everything.
p8
aVIn my mother's day, she didn't go to college.
p9
aVNot a lot of women did.
p10
aVAnd now, for every two men who get a college degree,
p11
aVthree women will do the same.
p12
aVWomen, for the first time this year,
p13
aVbecame the majority of the American workforce.
p14
aVAnd they're starting to dominate lots of professions \u2014
p15
aVdoctors, lawyers,
p16
aVbankers, accountants.
p17
aVOver 50 percent of managers are women these days,
p18
aVand in the 15 professions
p19
aVprojected to grow the most in the next decade,
p20
aVall but two of them are dominated by women.
p21
aVSo the global economy is becoming a place
p22
aVwhere women are more successful than men,
p23
aVbelieve it or not,
p24
aVand these economic changes
p25
aVare starting to rapidly affect our culture \u2014
p26
aVwhat our romantic comedies look like,
p27
aVwhat our marriages look like,
p28
aVwhat our dating lives look like,
p29
aVand our new set of superheroes.
p30
aa(lp31
VFor a long time, this is the image of American manhood that dominated \u2014
p32
aVtough, rugged,
p33
aVin control of his own environment.
p34
aVA few years ago, the Marlboro Man was retired
p35
aVand replaced by this
p36
aVmuch less impressive specimen,
p37
aVwho is a parody of American manhood,
p38
aVand that's what we have in our commercials today.
p39
aVThe phrase "first-born son"
p40
aVis so deeply ingrained in our consciousness
p41
aVthat this statistic alone shocked me.
p42
aVIn American fertility clinics,
p43
aV75 percent of couples
p44
aVare requesting girls and not boys.
p45
aVAnd in places where you wouldn't think,
p46
aVsuch as South Korea, India and China,
p47
aVthe very strict patriarchal societies
p48
aVare starting to break down a little,
p49
aVand families are no longer
p50
aVstrongly preferring first-born sons.
p51
aa(lp52
VIf you think about this, if you just open your eyes to this possibility
p53
aVand start to connect the dots,
p54
aVyou can see the evidence everywhere.
p55
aVYou can see it in college graduation patterns,
p56
aVin job projections,
p57
aVin our marriage statistics,
p58
aVyou can see it in the Icelandic elections, which you'll hear about later,
p59
aVand you can see it on South Korean surveys on son preference,
p60
aVthat something amazing and unprecedented
p61
aVis happening with women.
p62
aVCertainly this is not the first time that we've had great progress with women.
p63
aVThe '20s and the '60s also come to mind.
p64
aVBut the difference is that, back then,
p65
aVit was driven by a very passionate feminist movement
p66
aVthat was trying to project its own desires,
p67
aVwhereas this time, it's not about passion,
p68
aVand it's not about any kind of movement.
p69
aVThis is really just about the facts
p70
aVof this economic moment that we live in.
p71
aVThe 200,000-year period
p72
aVin which men have been top dog
p73
aVis truly coming to an end, believe it or not,
p74
aVand that's why I talk about the "end of men."
p75
aa(lp76
VNow all you men out there,
p77
aVthis is not the moment where you tune out or throw some tomatoes,
p78
aVbecause the point is that this
p79
aVis happening to all of us.
p80
aVI myself have a husband and a father
p81
aVand two sons whom I dearly love.
p82
aVAnd this is why I like to talk about this,
p83
aVbecause if we don't acknowledge it,
p84
aVthen the transition will be pretty painful.
p85
aVBut if we do take account of it,
p86
aVthen I think it will go much more smoothly.
p87
aVI first started thinking about this about a year and a half ago.
p88
aVI was reading headlines about the recession just like anyone else,
p89
aVand I started to notice a distinct pattern \u2014
p90
aVthat the recession was affecting men
p91
aVmuch more deeply than it was affecting women.
p92
aVAnd I remembered back to about 10 years ago
p93
aVwhen I read a book by Susan Faludi
p94
aVcalled "Stiffed: The Betrayal of the American Man,"
p95
aVin which she described how hard the recession had hit men,
p96
aVand I started to think about
p97
aVwhether it had gotten worse this time around in this recession.
p98
aVAnd I realized that two things were different this time around.
p99
aVThe first was that
p100
aVthese were no longer just temporary hits
p101
aVthat the recession was giving men \u2014
p102
aVthat this was reflecting a deeper
p103
aVunderlying shift in our global economy.
p104
aVAnd second, that the story was no longer
p105
aVjust about the crisis of men,
p106
aVbut it was also about what was happening to women.
p107
aa(lp108
VAnd now look at this second set of slides.
p109
aVThese are headlines about what's been going on with women in the next few years.
p110
aVThese are things we never could have imagined a few years ago.
p111
aVWomen, a majority of the workplace.
p112
aVAnd labor statistics: women take up most managerial jobs.
p113
aVThis second set of headlines \u2014
p114
aVyou can see that families and marriages are starting to shift.
p115
aVAnd look at that last headline \u2014
p116
aVyoung women earning more than young men.
p117
aVThat particular headline comes to me from a market research firm.
p118
aVThey were basically asked by one of their clients
p119
aVwho was going to buy houses in that neighborhood in the future.
p120
aVAnd they expected that it would be young families,
p121
aVor young men, just like it had always been.
p122
aVBut in fact, they found something very surprising.
p123
aVIt was young, single women
p124
aVwho were the major purchasers of houses in the neighborhood.
p125
aVAnd so they decided, because they were intrigued by this finding,
p126
aVto do a nationwide survey.
p127
aVSo they spread out all the census data,
p128
aVand what they found, the guy described to me as a shocker,
p129
aVwhich is that in 1,997
p130
aVout of 2,000 communities,
p131
aVwomen, young women,
p132
aVwere making more money than young men.
p133
aVSo here you have a generation of young women
p134
aVwho grow up thinking of themselves
p135
aVas being more powerful earners
p136
aVthan the young men around them.
p137
aa(lp138
VNow, I've just laid out the picture for you,
p139
aVbut I still haven't explained to you why this is happening.
p140
aVAnd in a moment, I'm going to show you a graph,
p141
aVand what you'll see on this graph \u2014
p142
aVit begins in 1973,
p143
aVjust before women start flooding the workforce,
p144
aVand it brings us up to our current day.
p145
aVAnd basically what you'll see
p146
aVis what economists talk about
p147
aVas the polarization of the economy.
p148
aVNow what does that mean?
p149
aVIt means that the economy is dividing into high-skill, high-wage jobs
p150
aVand low-skill, low-wage jobs \u2014
p151
aVand that the middle, the middle-skill jobs,
p152
aVand the middle-earning jobs, are starting to drop out of the economy.
p153
aVThis has been going on for 40 years now.
p154
aVBut this process is affecting men
p155
aVvery differently than it's affecting women.
p156
aVYou'll see the women in red, and you'll see the men in blue.
p157
aVYou'll watch them both drop out of the middle class,
p158
aVbut see what happens to women and see what happens to men.
p159
aVThere we go.
p160
aVSo watch that. You see them both drop out of the middle class.
p161
aVWatch what happens to the women. Watch what happens to the men.
p162
aVThe men sort of stagnate there,
p163
aVwhile the women zoom up in those high-skill jobs.
p164
aVSo what's that about?
p165
aVIt looks like women got some power boost on a video game,
p166
aVor like they snuck in some secret serum into their birth-control pills
p167
aVthat lets them shoot up high.
p168
aVBut of course, it's not about that.
p169
aa(lp170
VWhat it's about is that the economy has changed a lot.
p171
aVWe used to have a manufacturing economy,
p172
aVwhich was about building goods and products,
p173
aVand now we have a service economy
p174
aVand an information and creative economy.
p175
aVThose two economies require very different skills,
p176
aVand as it happens, women have been much better
p177
aVat acquiring the new set of skills than men have been.
p178
aVIt used to be that you were
p179
aVa guy who went to high school
p180
aVwho didn't have a college degree,
p181
aVbut you had a specific set of skills,
p182
aVand with the help of a union,
p183
aVyou could make yourself a pretty good middle-class life.
p184
aVBut that really isn't true anymore.
p185
aVThis new economy is pretty indifferent
p186
aVto size and strength,
p187
aVwhich is what's helped men along all these years.
p188
aVWhat the economy requires now
p189
aVis a whole different set of skills.
p190
aVYou basically need intelligence,
p191
aVyou need an ability to sit still and focus,
p192
aVto communicate openly,
p193
aVto be able to listen to people
p194
aVand to operate in a workplace that is much more fluid than it used to be,
p195
aVand those are things that women do extremely well,
p196
aVas we're seeing.
p197
aa(lp198
VIf you look at management theory these days,
p199
aVit used to be that our ideal leader
p200
aVsounded something like General Patton, right?
p201
aVYou would be issuing orders from above.
p202
aVYou would be very hierarchical.
p203
aVYou would tell everyone below you what to do.
p204
aVBut that's not what an ideal leader is like now.
p205
aVIf you read management books now,
p206
aVa leader is somebody who can foster creativity,
p207
aVwho can get his \u2014 get the employees \u2014 see, I still say "his" \u2014
p208
aVwho can get the employees to talk to each other,
p209
aVwho can basically build teams and get them to be creative.
p210
aVAnd those are all things that women do very well.
p211
aa(lp212
VAnd then on top of that, that's created a kind of cascading effect.
p213
aVWomen enter the workplace at the top,
p214
aVand then at the working class,
p215
aVall the new jobs that are created
p216
aVare the kinds of jobs that wives used to do for free at home.
p217
aVSo that's childcare,
p218
aVelder care and food preparation.
p219
aVSo those are all the jobs that are growing,
p220
aVand those are jobs that women tend to do.
p221
aVNow one day it might be
p222
aVthat mothers will hire an out-of-work,
p223
aVmiddle-aged, former steelworker guy
p224
aVto watch their children at home,
p225
aVand that would be good for the men, but that hasn't quite happened yet.
p226
aa(lp227
VTo see what's going to happen, you can't just look at the workforce that is now,
p228
aVyou have to look at our future workforce.
p229
aVAnd here the story is fairly simple.
p230
aVWomen are getting college degrees
p231
aVat a faster rate than men.
p232
aVWhy? This is a real mystery.
p233
aVPeople have asked men, why don't they just go back to college,
p234
aVto community college, say, and retool themselves,
p235
aVlearn a new set of skills?
p236
aVWell it turns out that they're just very uncomfortable doing that.
p237
aVThey're used to thinking of themselves as providers,
p238
aVand they can't seem to build the social networks
p239
aVthat allow them to get through college.
p240
aVSo for some reason
p241
aVmen just don't end up going back to college.
p242
aVAnd what's even more disturbing
p243
aVis what's happening with younger boys.
p244
aVThere's been about a decade of research
p245
aVabout what people are calling the "boy crisis."
p246
aVNow the boy crisis is this idea
p247
aVthat very young boys, for whatever reason,
p248
aVare doing worse in school than very young girls,
p249
aVand people have theories about that.
p250
aVIs it because we have an excessively verbal curriculum,
p251
aVand little girls are better at that than little boys?
p252
aVOr that we require kids to sit still too much,
p253
aVand so boys initially feel like failures?
p254
aVAnd some people say it's because,
p255
aVin 9th grade, boys start dropping out of school.
p256
aVBecause I'm writing a book about all this, I'm still looking into it,
p257
aVso I don't have the answer.
p258
aVBut in the mean time, I'm going to call on the worldwide education expert,
p259
aVwho's my 10-year-old daughter, Noa,
p260
aVto talk to you about
p261
aVwhy the boys in her class do worse.
p262
aa(lp263
V(Video) Noa: The girls are obviously smarter.
p264
aVI mean they have much larger vocabulary.
p265
aVThey learn much faster.
p266
aVThey are more controlled.
p267
aVOn the board today for losing recess tomorrow, only boys.
p268
aa(lp269
VHanna Rosin: And why is that?
p270
aa(lp271
VNoa: Why? They were just not listening to the class
p272
aVwhile the girls sat there very nicely.
p273
aa(lp274
VHR: So there you go.
p275
aVThis whole thesis really came home to me
p276
aVwhen I went to visit a college in Kansas City \u2014
p277
aVworking-class college.
p278
aVCertainly, when I was in college, I had certain expectations about my life \u2014
p279
aVthat my husband and I would both work,
p280
aVand that we would equally raise the children.
p281
aVBut these college girls
p282
aVhad a completely different view of their future.
p283
aVBasically, the way they said it to me is
p284
aVthat they would be working 18 hours a day,
p285
aVthat their husband would maybe have a job,
p286
aVbut that mostly he would be at home taking care of the kiddies.
p287
aVAnd this was kind of a shocker to me.
p288
aVAnd then here's my favorite quote from one of the girls:
p289
aV"Men are the new ball and chain."
p290
aa(lp291
V(Laughter)
p292
aa(lp293
VNow you laugh,
p294
aVbut that quote has kind of a sting to it, right?
p295
aVAnd I think the reason it has a sting
p296
aVis because thousands of years of history
p297
aVdon't reverse themselves
p298
aVwithout a lot of pain,
p299
aVand that's why I talk about
p300
aVus all going through this together.
p301
aVThe night after I talked to these college girls,
p302
aVI also went to a men's group in Kansas,
p303
aVand these were exactly the kind of victims of the manufacturing economy
p304
aVwhich I spoke to you about earlier.
p305
aVThey were men who had been contractors,
p306
aVor they had been building houses
p307
aVand they had lost their jobs after the housing boom,
p308
aVand they were in this group because they were failing to pay their child support.
p309
aVAnd the instructor was up there in the class
p310
aVexplaining to them all the ways
p311
aVin which they had lost their identity in this new age.
p312
aVHe was telling them they no longer had any moral authority,
p313
aVthat nobody needed them for emotional support anymore,
p314
aVand they were not really the providers.
p315
aVSo who were they?
p316
aVAnd this was very disheartening for them.
p317
aVAnd what he did was he wrote down on the board
p318
aV"$85,000,"
p319
aVand he said, "That's her salary,"
p320
aVand then he wrote down "$12,000."
p321
aV"That's your salary.
p322
aVSo who's the man now?" he asked them.
p323
aV"Who's the damn man?
p324
aVShe's the man now."
p325
aVAnd that really sent a shudder through the room.
p326
aVAnd that's part of the reason I like to talk about this,
p327
aVbecause I think it can be pretty painful,
p328
aVand we really have to work through it.
p329
aa(lp330
VAnd the other reason it's kind of urgent
p331
aVis because it's not just happening in the U.S.
p332
aVIt's happening all over the world.
p333
aVIn India, poor women are learning English
p334
aVfaster than their male counterparts
p335
aVin order to staff the new call centers
p336
aVthat are growing in India.
p337
aVIn China, a lot of the opening up of private entrepreneurship
p338
aVis happening because women are starting businesses,
p339
aVsmall businesses, faster than men.
p340
aVAnd here's my favorite example, which is in South Korea.
p341
aVOver several decades,
p342
aVSouth Korea built one of the most patriarchal societies we know about.
p343
aVThey basically enshrined the second-class status of women
p344
aVin the civil code.
p345
aVAnd if women failed to birth male children,
p346
aVthey were basically treated like domestic servants.
p347
aVAnd sometimes family would pray to the spirits to kill off a girl child
p348
aVso they could have a male child.
p349
aVBut over the '70s and '80s,
p350
aVthe South Korea government decided they wanted to rapidly industrialize,
p351
aVand so what they did was,
p352
aVthey started to push women into the workforce.
p353
aVNow they've been asking a question since 1985:
p354
aV"How strongly do you prefer a first-born son?"
p355
aVAnd now look at the chart.
p356
aVThat's from 1985 to 2003.
p357
aVHow much do you prefer a first-born son?
p358
aa(lp359
VSo you can see that these economic changes
p360
aVreally do have a strong effect on our culture.
p361
aVNow because we haven't fully processed this information,
p362
aVit's kind of coming back to us in our pop culture
p363
aVin these kind of weird and exaggerated ways,
p364
aVwhere you can see that the stereotypes are changing.
p365
aVAnd so we have on the male side
p366
aVwhat one of my colleagues likes to call the "omega males" popping up,
p367
aVwho are the males who are romantically challenged losers
p368
aVwho can't find a job.
p369
aVAnd they come up in lots of different forms.
p370
aVSo we have the perpetual adolescent.
p371
aVWe have the charmless misanthrope.
p372
aVThen we have our Bud Light guy
p373
aVwho's the happy couch potato.
p374
aVAnd then here's a shocker: even America's most sexiest man alive,
p375
aVthe sexiest man alive
p376
aVgets romantically played these days in a movie.
p377
aVAnd then on the female side, you have the opposite,
p378
aVin which you have these crazy superhero women.
p379
aVYou've got Lady Gaga.
p380
aVYou've got our new James Bond, who's Angelina Jolie.
p381
aVAnd it's not just for the young, right?
p382
aVEven Helen Mirren can hold a gun these days.
p383
aVAnd so it feels like we have to move from this place
p384
aVwhere we've got these uber-exaggerated images
p385
aVinto something that feels a little more normal.
p386
aa(lp387
VSo for a long time in the economic sphere,
p388
aVwe've lived with the term "glass ceiling."
p389
aVNow I've never really liked this term.
p390
aVFor one thing, it puts men and women
p391
aVin a really antagonistic relationship with one another,
p392
aVbecause the men are these devious tricksters up there
p393
aVwho've put up this glass ceiling.
p394
aVAnd we're always below the glass ceiling, the women.
p395
aVAnd we have a lot of skill and experience,
p396
aVbut it's a trick, so how are you supposed to prepare
p397
aVto get through that glass ceiling?
p398
aVAnd also, "shattering the glass ceiling" is a terrible phrase.
p399
aVWhat crazy person
p400
aVwould pop their head through a glass ceiling?
p401
aa(lp402
VSo the image that I like to think of,
p403
aVinstead of glass ceiling,
p404
aVis the high bridge.
p405
aVIt's definitely terrifying to stand at the foot of a high bridge,
p406
aVbut it's also pretty exhilarating,
p407
aVbecause it's beautiful up there,
p408
aVand you're looking out on a beautiful view.
p409
aVAnd the great thing is there's no trick like with the glass ceiling.
p410
aVThere's no man or woman standing in the middle
p411
aVabout to cut the cables.
p412
aVThere's no hole in the middle that you're going to fall through.
p413
aVAnd the great thing is that you can take anyone along with you.
p414
aVYou can bring your husband along.
p415
aVYou can bring your friends, or your colleagues,
p416
aVor your babysitter to walk along with you.
p417
aVAnd husbands can drag their wives across, if their wives don't feel ready.
p418
aVBut the point about the high bridge
p419
aVis that you have to have the confidence
p420
aVto know that you deserve to be on that bridge,
p421
aVthat you have all the skills and experience you need
p422
aVin order to walk across the high bridge,
p423
aVbut you just have to make the decision
p424
aVto take the first step and do it.
p425
