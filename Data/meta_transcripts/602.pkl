VI'm a neuroscientist, a professor at the University of California.
p4
aVAnd over the past 35 years,
p5
aVI've studied behavior
p6
aVon the basis of everything from genes
p7
aVthrough neurotransmitters, dopamine, things like that,
p8
aVall the way through circuit analysis.
p9
aVSo that's what I normally do.
p10
aVBut then, for some reason,
p11
aVI got into something else, just recently.
p12
aVAnd it all grew out of one of my colleagues asking me
p13
aVto analyze a bunch of brains
p14
aVof psychopathic killers.
p15
aa(lp16
VAnd so this would be the typical talk I would give.
p17
aVAnd the question is, "How do you end up with a psychopathic killer?"
p18
aVWhat I mean by psychopathic killer
p19
aVare these people, these types of people.
p20
aVAnd so some of the brains that I've studied
p21
aVare people you know about.
p22
aVWhen I get the brains I don't know what I'm looking at.
p23
aVIt's blind experiments. They also gave me normal people and everything.
p24
aa(lp25
VSo I've looked at about 70 of these.
p26
aVAnd what came up was a number of pieces of data.
p27
aVSo we look at these sorts of things theoretically,
p28
aVon the basis of genetics,
p29
aVand brain damage, and interaction with environment,
p30
aVand exactly how that machine works.
p31
aVSo we're interested in exactly where in the brain,
p32
aVand what's the most important part of the brain.
p33
aVSo we've been looking at this:
p34
aVthe interaction of genes,
p35
aVwhat's called epigenetic effects,
p36
aVbrain damage, and environment,
p37
aVand how these are tied together.
p38
aVAnd how you end up with a psychopath, and a killer,
p39
aVdepends on exactly when the damage occurs.
p40
aVIt's really a very precisely timed thing.
p41
aVYou get different kinds of psychopaths.
p42
aa(lp43
VSo we're going along with this. And here's, just to give you the pattern.
p44
aVThe pattern is that those people, every one of them I looked at,
p45
aVwho was a murderer, and was a serial killer,
p46
aVhad damage to their orbital cortex,
p47
aVwhich is right above the eyes, the orbits,
p48
aVand also the interior part of the temporal lobe.
p49
aVSo there is the pattern that every one of them had,
p50
aVbut they all were a little different too.
p51
aVThey had other sorts of brain damage.
p52
aVA key thing is that
p53
aVthe major violence genes,
p54
aVit's called the MAO-A gene.
p55
aa(lp56
VAnd there is a variant of this gene that is in the normal population.
p57
aVSome of you have this. And it's sex-linked.
p58
aVIt's on the X chromosome. And so in this way
p59
aVyou can only get it from your mother.
p60
aVAnd in fact this is probably why mostly men, boys,
p61
aVare psychopathic killers,
p62
aVor are very aggressive.
p63
aVBecause a daughter can get one X from the father,
p64
aVone X from the mother, it's kind of diluted out.
p65
aVBut for a son, he can only get
p66
aVthe X chromosome from his mother.
p67
aa(lp68
VSo this is how it's passed from mother to son.
p69
aVAnd it has to do with too much brain serotonin during development,
p70
aVwhich is kind of interesting because serotonin
p71
aVis supposed to make you calm and relaxed.
p72
aVBut if you have this gene, in utero
p73
aVyour brain is bathed in this,
p74
aVso your whole brain becomes insensitive to serotonin,
p75
aVso it doesn't work later on in life.
p76
aa(lp77
VAnd I'd given this one talk in Israel,
p78
aVjust this past year.
p79
aVAnd it does have some consequences.
p80
aVTheoretically what this means
p81
aVis that in order to express this gene,
p82
aVin a violent way,
p83
aVvery early on, before puberty,
p84
aVyou have to be involved in something that is really traumatic \u2014
p85
aVnot a little stress, not being spanked or something,
p86
aVbut really seeing violence,
p87
aVor being involved in it, in 3D.
p88
aVRight? That's how the mirror neuron system works.
p89
aa(lp90
VAnd so, if you have that gene,
p91
aVand you see a lot of violence
p92
aVin a certain situation,
p93
aVthis is the recipe for disaster, absolute disaster.
p94
aVAnd what I think might happen in these areas of the world,
p95
aVwhere we have constant violence,
p96
aVyou end up having generations of kids
p97
aVthat are seeing all this violence.
p98
aVAnd if I was a young girl, somewhere in a violent area,
p99
aVyou know, a 14 year old, and I want to find a mate,
p100
aVI'd find some tough guy, right, to protect me.
p101
aVWell what the problem is this tends to concentrate these genes.
p102
aVAnd now the boys and the girls get them.
p103
aVSo I think after several generations,
p104
aVand here is the idea, we really have a tinderbox.
p105
aa(lp106
VSo that was the idea.
p107
aVBut then my mother said to me, "I hear you've been going around talking
p108
aVabout psychopathic killers.
p109
aVAnd you're talking as if you come from a normal family."
p110
aVI said, "What the hell are you talking about?"
p111
aVShe then told me about our own family tree.
p112
aVNow she blamed this on my father's side, of course.
p113
aVThis was one of these cases, because she has no violence in her background,
p114
aVbut my father did.
p115
aa(lp116
VWell she said, "There is good news and bad news.
p117
aVOne of your cousins is Ezra Cornell, founder of Cornell university.
p118
aVBut the bad news is that your cousin is also Lizzie Borden.
p119
aa(lp120
VNow I said, "Okay, so what? We have Lizzie."
p121
aa(lp122
VShe goes, "No it gets worse, read this book."
p123
aa(lp124
VAnd here is this "Killed Strangely," and it's this historical book.
p125
aVAnd the first murder
p126
aVof a mother by a son
p127
aVwas my great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather.
p128
aVOkay, so that's the first case of matricide.
p129
aVAnd that book is very interesting. Because it's about witch trials,
p130
aVand how people thought back then.
p131
aa(lp132
VBut it doesn't stop there.
p133
aVThere were seven more men, on my father's side,
p134
aVstarting then, Cornells, that were all murderers.
p135
aVOkay, now this gives one a little pause.
p136
aV(Laughter)
p137
aVBecause my father himself,
p138
aVand my three uncles, in World War II,
p139
aVwere all conscientious objectors, all pussycats.
p140
aVBut every once in a while, like Lizzie Borden, like three times a century,
p141
aVand we're kind of due.
p142
aV(Laughter)
p143
aa(lp144
VSo the moral of the story is:
p145
aVpeople in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.
p146
aVBut more likely is this.
p147
aV(Laughter)
p148
aVAnd we had to take action. Now our kids found out about it.
p149
aVAnd they all seemed to be OK.
p150
aVBut our grandkids are going to be kind of concerned here.
p151
aVSo what we've done is I've started to do PET scans
p152
aVof everybody in the family.
p153
aV(Laughter)
p154
aVWe started to do PET scans, EEGs and genetic analysis
p155
aVto see where the bad news is.
p156
aVNow the only person \u2014 it turns out
p157
aVone son and one daughter, siblings,
p158
aVdidn't get along and their patterns are exactly the same.
p159
aVThey have the same brain, and the same EEG.
p160
aVAnd now they are close as can be.
p161
aVBut there's gonna be bad news somewhere.
p162
aVAnd we don't know where it's going to pop up.
p163
aVSo that's my talk.
