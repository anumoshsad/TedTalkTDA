VThe Kraken, a beast so terrifying
p4
aVit was said to devour men and ships and whales,
p5
aVand so enormous it could be mistaken for an island.
p6
aVIn assessing the merits of such tales,
p7
aVit's probably wise to keep in mind that old sailor's saw
p8
aVthat the only difference between a fairytale and a sea story
p9
aVis a fairytale begins, "Once upon a time,"
p10
aVand a sea story begins, "This ain't no shit." (Laughter)
p11
aa(lp12
VEvery fish that gets away
p13
aVgrows with every telling of the tale.
p14
aVNevertheless, there are giants in the ocean,
p15
aVand we now have video proof,
p16
aVas those of you that saw the Discovery Channel documentary are no doubt aware.
p17
aa(lp18
VI was one of the three scientists on this expedition
p19
aVthat took place last summer off Japan.
p20
aVI'm the short one.
p21
aVThe other two are Dr. Tsunemi Kubodera and Dr. Steve O'Shea.
p22
aa(lp23
VI owe my participation in this now-historic event
p24
aVto TED.
p25
aVIn 2010, there was a TED event called Mission Blue
p26
aVheld aboard the Lindblad Explorer in the Galapagos
p27
aVas part of the fulfillment of Sylvia Earle's TED wish.
p28
aVI spoke about a new way of exploring the ocean,
p29
aVone that focuses on attracting animals instead of scaring them away.
p30
aVMike deGruy was also invited,
p31
aVand he spoke with great passion about his love of the ocean,
p32
aVand he also talked to me about applying my approach
p33
aVto something he's been involved with for a very long time,
p34
aVwhich is the hunt for the giant squid.
p35
aVIt was Mike that got me invited to the squid summit,
p36
aVa gathering of squid experts at the Discovery Channel
p37
aVthat summer during Shark Week. (Laughter)
p38
aa(lp39
VI gave a talk on unobtrusive viewing
p40
aVand optical luring of deep sea squid
p41
aVin which I emphasized the importance
p42
aVof using quiet, unobtrusive platforms for exploration.
p43
aVThis came out of hundreds of dives I have made,
p44
aVfarting around in the dark
p45
aVusing these platforms,
p46
aVand my impression that I saw more animals
p47
aVworking from the submersible
p48
aVthan I did with either of the remote-operated vehicles.
p49
aVBut that could just be because the submersible has a wider field of view.
p50
aVBut I also felt like I saw more animals
p51
aVworking with the Tiburon than the Ventana,
p52
aVtwo vehicles with the same field of view
p53
aVbut different propulsion systems.
p54
aa(lp55
VSo my suspicion was that it might have something to do with the amount of noise they make.
p56
aVSo I set up a hydrophone on the bottom of the ocean,
p57
aVand I had each of these fly by at the same speed and distance
p58
aVand recorded the sound they made.
p59
aVThe Johnson Sea-Link \u2014 (whirring noise) \u2014
p60
aVwhich you can probably just barely hear here,
p61
aVuses electric thrusters \u2014 very, very quiet.
p62
aVThe Tiburon also uses electric powered thrusters.
p63
aVIt's also pretty quiet, but a bit noisier. (Louder whirring noise)
p64
aVBut most deep-diving ROVs these days use hydraulics
p65
aVand they sound like the Ventana. (Loud beeping noise)
p66
aVI think that's got to be scaring a lot of animals away.
p67
aa(lp68
VSo for the deep sea squid hunt,
p69
aVI proposed using an optical lure
p70
aVattached to a camera platform
p71
aVwith no thrusters, no motors,
p72
aVjust a battery-powered camera,
p73
aVand the only illumination coming from red light
p74
aVthat's invisible to most deep-sea animals
p75
aVthat are adapted to see primarily blue.
p76
aVThat's visible to our eye,
p77
aVbut it's the equivalent of infrared in the deep sea.
p78
aVSo this camera platform, which we called the Medusa,
p79
aVcould just be thrown off the back of the ship,
p80
aVattached to a float at the surface with over 2,000 feet of line,
p81
aVit would just float around passively carried by the currents,
p82
aVand the only light visible to the animals in the deep
p83
aVwould be the blue light of the optical lure,
p84
aVwhich we called the electronic jellyfish, or e-jelly,
p85
aVbecause it was designed to imitate
p86
aVthe bioluminescent display
p87
aVof the common deep sea jellyfish Atolla.
p88
aa(lp89
VNow, this pinwheel of light that the Atolla produces
p90
aVis known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm
p91
aVand is a form of defense.
p92
aVThe reason that the electronic jellyfish worked as a lure
p93
aVis not because giant squid eat jellyfish,
p94
aVbut it's because this jellyfish only resorts to producing this light
p95
aVwhen it's being chewed on by a predator
p96
aVand its only hope for escape
p97
aVmay be to attract the attention of a larger predator
p98
aVthat will attack its attacker
p99
aVand thereby afford it an opportunity for escape.
p100
aVIt's a scream for help, a last-ditch attempt for escape,
p101
aVand a common form of defense in the deep sea.
p102
aa(lp103
VThe approach worked.
p104
aVWhereas all previous expeditions had failed to garner
p105
aVa single video glimpse of the giant,
p106
aVwe managed six, and the first triggered wild excitement.
p107
aa(lp108
VEdith Widder (on video): Oh my God. Oh my God! Are you kidding me?Other scientists: Oh ho ho! That's just hanging there.
p109
aa(lp110
VEW: It was like it was teasing us, doing a kind of fan dance \u2014
p111
aVnow you see me, now you don't \u2014
p112
aVand we had four such teasing appearances,
p113
aVand then on the fifth, it came in and totally wowed us.
p114
aa(lp115
V(Music) Narrator: (Speaking in Japanese)
p116
aa(lp117
VScientists: Ooh. Bang! Oh my God! Whoa!
p118
aa(lp119
V(Applause)
p120
aa(lp121
VEW: The full monty.
p122
aa(lp123
VWhat really wowed me about that
p124
aVwas the way it came in up over the e-jelly
p125
aVand then attacked the enormous thing next to it,
p126
aVwhich I think it mistook for the predator on the e-jelly.
p127
aa(lp128
VBut even more incredible was the footage shot
p129
aVfrom the Triton submersible.
p130
aVWhat was not mentioned in the Discovery documentary
p131
aVwas that the bait squid that Dr. Kubodera used,
p132
aVa one-meter long diamondback squid
p133
aVhad a light attached to it, a squid jig
p134
aVof the type that longline fishermen use,
p135
aVand I think it was this light
p136
aVthat brought the giant in.
p137
aa(lp138
VNow, what you're seeing
p139
aVis the intensified camera's view under red light,
p140
aVand that's all Dr. Kubodera could see when the giant comes in here.
p141
aVAnd then he got so excited,
p142
aVhe turned on his flashlight because he wanted to see better,
p143
aVand the giant didn't run away,
p144
aVso he risked turning on the white lights on the submersible,
p145
aVbringing a creature of legend
p146
aVfrom the misty history into high-resolution video.
p147
aVIt was absolutely breathtaking,
p148
aVand had this animal had its feeding tentacles intact
p149
aVand fully extended,
p150
aVit would have been as tall as a two-story house.
p151
aa(lp152
VHow could something that big
p153
aVlive in our ocean and yet remain unfilmed until now?
p154
aVWe've only explored about five percent of our ocean.
p155
aVThere are great discoveries yet to be made down there,
p156
aVfantastic creatures representing millions of years of evolution
p157
aVand possibly bioactive compounds
p158
aVthat could benefit us in ways that we can't even yet imagine.
p159
aVYet we have spent only a tiny fraction
p160
aVof the money on ocean exploration
p161
aVthat we've spent on space exploration.
p162
aVWe need a NASA-like organization for ocean exploration,
p163
aVbecause we need to be exploring and protecting
p164
aVour life support systems here on Earth.
p165
aa(lp166
VWe need \u2014 thank you. (Applause)
p167
aa(lp168
VExploration is the engine that drives innovation.
p169
aVInnovation drives economic growth.
p170
aVSo let's all go exploring,
p171
aVbut let's do it in a way that doesn't scare the animals away,
p172
aVor, as Mike deGruy once said,
p173
aV"If you want to get away from it all
p174
aVand see something you've never seen,
p175
aVor have an excellent chance of seeing something that no one's ever seen,
p176
aVget in a sub."
p177
aVHe should have been with us for this adventure.
p178
aVWe miss him.
