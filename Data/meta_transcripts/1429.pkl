VIt's a great honor to be here.
p4
aVIt's a great honor to be here talking about cities,
p5
aVtalking about the future of cities.
p6
aVIt's great to be here as a mayor.
p7
aVI really do believe that mayors have the political position
p8
aVto really change people's lives.
p9
aVThat's the place to be.
p10
aVAnd it's great to be here as the mayor of Rio.
p11
aVRio's a beautiful city,
p12
aVa vibrant place, special place.
p13
aVActually, you're looking at a guy
p14
aVwho has the best job in the world.
p15
aVAnd I really wanted to share with you
p16
aVa very special moment of my life
p17
aVand the history of the city of Rio.
p18
aa(lp19
V(Video) Announcer: And now, ladies and gentlemen,
p20
aVthe envelope containing the result.
p21
aVJacques Rogge: I have the honor to announce
p22
aVthat the games of the 31st Olympiad
p23
aVare awarded to the city of Rio de Janeiro.
p24
aV(Cheering)
p25
aa(lp26
VEP: Okay, that's very touching, very emotional,
p27
aVbut it was not easy to get there.
p28
aVActually it was a very hard challenge.
p29
aVWe had to beat the European monarchy.
p30
aVThis is Juan Carlos, king of Spain.
p31
aVWe had to beat the powerful Japanese with all of their technology.
p32
aVWe had to beat the most powerful man in the world
p33
aVdefending his own city.
p34
aVSo it was not easy at all.
p35
aVAnd actually this last guy here said a phrase a few years ago
p36
aVthat I think fits perfectly to the situation
p37
aVof Rio winning the Olympic bid.
p38
aVWe really showed that, yes, we can.
p39
aa(lp40
VAnd really, this is the reason I came here tonight.
p41
aVI came here tonight to tell you
p42
aVthat things can be done,
p43
aVthat you don't have always to be rich or powerful
p44
aVto get things on the way,
p45
aVthat cities are a great challenge.
p46
aVIt's a difficult task to deal with cities.
p47
aVBut with some original ways
p48
aVof getting things done,
p49
aVwith some basic commandments,
p50
aVyou can really get cities
p51
aVto be a great, great place to live.
p52
aVI want you all to imagine Rio.
p53
aVYou probably think about a city full of energy,
p54
aVa vibrant city full of green.
p55
aVAnd nobody showed that better
p56
aVthan Carlos Saldanha in last year's "Rio."
p57
aa(lp58
V(Music)
p59
aV(Video) Bird: This is incredible.
p60
aV(Music)
p61
aa(lp62
VEP: Okay, some parts of Rio are pretty much like that,
p63
aVbut it's not like that everywhere.
p64
aVWe're like every big city in the world.
p65
aVWe've got lots of people,
p66
aVpollution, cars, concrete, lots of concrete.
p67
aVThese pictures I'm showing here,
p68
aVthey are some pictures from Madureira.
p69
aVIt's like the heart of the suburb in Rio.
p70
aVAnd I want to use an example of Rio
p71
aVthat we're doing in Madureira, in this region,
p72
aVto see what we should think as our first commandment.
p73
aa(lp74
VSo every time you see a concrete jungle like that,
p75
aVwhat you've got to do is find open spaces.
p76
aVIf you don't have open spaces,
p77
aVyou've got to go there and open spaces.
p78
aVSo go inside these open spaces
p79
aVand make it that people can get inside
p80
aVand use those spaces.
p81
aVThis is going to be the third largest park in Rio
p82
aVby June this year.
p83
aVIt's going to be a place where people can meet,
p84
aVwhere you can put nature.
p85
aVThe temperature's going to drop two, three degrees centigrade.
p86
aVSo the first commandment
p87
aVI want to leave you tonight
p88
aVis, a city of the future
p89
aVhas to be environmentally friendly.
p90
aVEvery time you think of a city,
p91
aVyou've got to think green.
p92
aVYou've got to think green and green.
p93
aa(lp94
VSo moving to our second commandment that I wanted to show you.
p95
aVLet's think that cities are made of people,
p96
aVlots of people together.
p97
aVcities are packed with people.
p98
aVSo how do you move these people around?
p99
aVWhen you have 3.5 billion people living in cities \u2014
p100
aVby 2050, it's going to be 6 billion people.
p101
aVSo every time you think about moving these people around,
p102
aVyou think about high-capacity transportation.
p103
aVBut there is a problem.
p104
aVHigh-capacity transportation means
p105
aVspending lots and lots of money.
p106
aa(lp107
VSo what I'm going to show here
p108
aVis something that was already presented in TED
p109
aVby the former mayor of Curitiba
p110
aVwho created that, a city in Brazil, Jaime Lerner.
p111
aVAnd it's something that we're doing, again, lots in Rio.
p112
aVIt's the BRT, the Bus Rapid Transit.
p113
aVSo you get a bus. It's a simple bus that everybody knows.
p114
aVYou transform it inside as a train car.
p115
aVYou use separate lanes, dedicated lanes.
p116
aVThe contractors, they don't like that.
p117
aVYou don't have to dig deep down underground.
p118
aVYou can build nice stations.
p119
aVThis is actually a station that we're doing in Rio.
p120
aVAgain, you don't have to dig deep down underground
p121
aVto make a station like that.
p122
aVThis station has the same comfort, the same features
p123
aVas a subway station.
p124
aVA kilometer of this costs a tenth of a subway.
p125
aVSo spending much less money and doing it much faster,
p126
aVyou can really change the way people move.
p127
aa(lp128
VThis is a map of Rio.
p129
aVAll the lines, the colored lines you see there,
p130
aVit's our high-capacity transportation network.
p131
aVIn this present time today,
p132
aVwe only carry 18 percent of our population
p133
aVin high-capacity transportation.
p134
aVWith the BRTs we're doing,
p135
aVagain, the cheapest and fastest way,
p136
aVwe're going to move to 63 percent of the population
p137
aVbeing carried by high-capacity transportation.
p138
aa(lp139
VSo remember what I said:
p140
aVYou don't always have to be rich or powerful
p141
aVto get things done.
p142
aVYou can find original ways to get things done.
p143
aVSo the second commandment I want to leave you tonight
p144
aVis, a city of the future
p145
aVhas to deal with mobility and integration
p146
aVof its people.
p147
aa(lp148
VMoving to the third commandment.
p149
aVAnd this is the most controversial one.
p150
aVIt has to do with the favelas, the slums \u2014
p151
aVwhatever you call it, there are different names all over the world.
p152
aVBut the point we want to make here tonight
p153
aVis, favelas are not always a problem.
p154
aVI mean, favelas can sometimes
p155
aVreally be a solution,
p156
aVif you deal with them,
p157
aVif you put public policy inside the favelas.
p158
aVLet me just show a map of Rio again.
p159
aVRio has 6.3 million inhabitants \u2014
p160
aVMore than 20 percent, 1.4 million, live in the favelas.
p161
aVAll these red parts are favelas.
p162
aVSo you see, they are spread all over the city.
p163
aVThis is a typical view of a favela in Rio.
p164
aVYou see the contrast between the rich and poor.
p165
aa(lp166
VSo I want to make two points here tonight about favelas.
p167
aVThe first one is,
p168
aVyou can change from what I call a [vicious] circle
p169
aVto a virtual circle.
p170
aVBut what you've got to do to get that
p171
aVis you've got to go inside the favelas,
p172
aVbring in the basic services \u2014
p173
aVmainly education and health \u2014 with high quality.
p174
aVI'm going to give a fast example here.
p175
aVThis was an old building in a favela in Rio \u2014
p176
aV[unclear favela name] \u2014
p177
aVthat we just transformed into a primary school,
p178
aVwith high quality.
p179
aVThis is primary assistance in health
p180
aVthat we built inside a favela,
p181
aVagain, with high quality.
p182
aVWe call it a family clinic.
p183
aVSo the first point is bring basic services
p184
aVinside the favelas
p185
aVwith high quality.
p186
aa(lp187
VThe second point I want to make about the favelas
p188
aVis, you've got to open spaces in the favela.
p189
aVBring infrastructure
p190
aVto the favelas, to the slums, wherever you are.
p191
aVRio has the aim, by 2020,
p192
aVto have all its favelas completely urbanized.
p193
aVAnother example, this was completely packed with houses,
p194
aVand then we built this, what we call, a knowledge square.
p195
aVThis is a place with high technology
p196
aVwhere the kids that live in a poor house next to this place
p197
aVcan go inside and have access to all technology.
p198
aVWe even built a theater there \u2014 3D movie.
p199
aVAnd this is the kind of change you can get for that.
p200
aVAnd by the end of the day you get something better than a TED Prize,
p201
aVwhich is this great laugh
p202
aVfrom a kid that lives in the favela.
p203
aVSo the third commandment I want to leave here tonight
p204
aVis, a city of the future
p205
aVhas to be socially integrated.
p206
aVYou cannot deal with a city
p207
aVif it's not socially integrated.
p208
aa(lp209
VBut moving to our fourth commandment,
p210
aVI really wouldn't be here tonight.
p211
aVBetween November and May, Rio's completely packed.
p212
aVWe just had last week Carnivale.
p213
aVIt was great. It was lots of fun.
p214
aVWe have New Year's Eve.
p215
aVThere's like two million people on Copacabana Beach.
p216
aVWe have problems.
p217
aVWe fight floods, tropical rains at this time of the year.
p218
aVYou can imagine how people get happy with me
p219
aVwatching these kinds of scenes.
p220
aVWe have problems with the tropical rains.
p221
aVAlmost every year
p222
aVwe have these landslides, which are terrible.
p223
aa(lp224
VBut the reason I could come here
p225
aVis because of that.
p226
aVThis was something we did with IBM
p227
aVthat's a little bit more than a year old.
p228
aVIt's what we call the Operations Center of Rio.
p229
aVAnd I wanted to show that I can govern my city, using technology,
p230
aVfrom here, from Long Beach,
p231
aVso I got here last night and I know everything.
p232
aVWe're going to speak now to the Operations Center.
p233
aVThis is Osorio,
p234
aVhe's our secretary of urban affairs.
p235
aVSo Osorio, good to be there with you.
p236
aVI've already told the people
p237
aVthat we have tropical rain this time of year.
p238
aVSo how's the weather in Rio now?
p239
aa(lp240
VOsorio: The weather is fine. We have fair weather today.
p241
aVLet me get you our weather satellite radar.
p242
aVYou see just a little bit of moisture around the city.
p243
aVAbsolutely no problem in the city in terms of weather,
p244
aVtoday and in the next few days.
p245
aa(lp246
VEP: Okay, how's the traffic?
p247
aVWe, at this time of year, get lots of traffic jams.
p248
aVPeople get mad at the mayor. So how's the traffic tonight?
p249
aa(lp250
VOsario: Well traffic tonight is fine.
p251
aVLet me get you one of our 8,000 buses.
p252
aVA live transmission in downtown Rio for you, Mr. Mayor.
p253
aVYou see, the streets are clear.
p254
aVNow it's 11:00 pm in Rio.
p255
aVNothing of concern in terms of traffic.
p256
aVI'll get to you now the incidents of the day.
p257
aVWe had heavy traffic early in the morning
p258
aVand in the rush hour in the afternoon,
p259
aVbut nothing of big concern.
p260
aVWe are below average
p261
aVin terms of traffic incidents in the city.
p262
aa(lp263
VEP: Okay, so you're showing now some public services.
p264
aVThese are the cars.
p265
aa(lp266
VOsorio: Absolutely, Mr. Mayor.
p267
aVLet me get you the fleet of our waste collection trucks.
p268
aVThis is live transmission.
p269
aVWe have GPS's in all of our trucks.
p270
aVAnd you can see them working
p271
aVin all parts of the city.
p272
aVWaste collection on time.
p273
aVPublic services working well.
p274
aa(lp275
VEP: Okay, Osorio, thank you very much.
p276
aVIt was great to have you here.
p277
aVWe're going to move so that I can make a conclusion.
p278
aV(Applause)
p279
aVOkay, so no files, this place, no paperwork,
p280
aVno distance, 24/7 working.
p281
aVSo the fourth commandment I want to share with you here tonight
p282
aVis, a city of the future
p283
aVhas to use technology to be present.
p284
aVI don't need to be there anymore to know and to administrate the city.
p285
aa(lp286
VBut everything that I said here tonight, or the commandments,
p287
aVare means, are ways,
p288
aVfor us to govern cities \u2014
p289
aVinvest in infrastructure, invest in the green,
p290
aVopen parks, open spaces,
p291
aVintegrate socially, use technology.
p292
aVBut at the end of the day, when we talk about cities,
p293
aVwe talk about a gathering of people.
p294
aVAnd we cannot see that as a problem.
p295
aVThat is fantastic.
p296
aVIf there's 3.5 billion now,
p297
aVit's going to be six billion then it's going to be 10 billion.
p298
aVThat is great, that means we're going to have
p299
aV10 billion minds working together,
p300
aV10 billion talents together.
p301
aa(lp302
VSo a city of the future,
p303
aVI really do believe
p304
aVthat it's a city that cares about its citizens,
p305
aVintegrates socially its citizens.
p306
aVA city of the future is a city that can never let anyone out
p307
aVof this great party, which are cities.
p308
aa(lp309
VThank you very much.
