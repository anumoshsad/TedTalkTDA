VWhen I was nine years old,
p4
aVmy mom asked me what I would want my house to look like,
p5
aVand I drew this fairy mushroom.
p6
aVAnd then she actually built it.
p7
aV(Laughter)
p8
aa(lp9
VI don't think I realized this was so unusual at the time,
p10
aVand maybe I still haven't,
p11
aVbecause I'm still designing houses.
p12
aVThis is a six-story bespoke home on the island of Bali.
p13
aVIt's built almost entirely from bamboo.
p14
aVThe living room overlooks the valley from the fourth floor.
p15
aVYou enter the house by a bridge.
p16
aVIt can get hot in the tropics,
p17
aVso we make big curving roofs to catch the breezes.
p18
aVBut some rooms have tall windows to keep the air conditioning in
p19
aVand the bugs out.
p20
aVThis room we left open.
p21
aVWe made an air-conditioned, tented bed.
p22
aVAnd one client wanted a TV room in the corner of her living room.
p23
aVBoxing off an area with tall walls just didn't feel right,
p24
aVso instead, we made this giant woven pod.
p25
aa(lp26
VNow, we do have all the necessary luxuries, like bathrooms.
p27
aVThis one is a basket in the corner of the living room,
p28
aVand I've got tell you, some people actually hesitate to use it.
p29
aVWe have not quite figured out our acoustic insulation.
p30
aV(Laughter)
p31
aVSo there are lots of things that we're still working on,
p32
aVbut one thing I have learned
p33
aVis that bamboo will treat you well if you use it right.
p34
aa(lp35
VIt's actually a wild grass.
p36
aVIt grows on otherwise unproductive land \u2014
p37
aVdeep ravines, mountainsides.
p38
aVIt lives off of rainwater, spring water, sunlight,
p39
aVand of the 1,450 species of bamboo that grow across the world,
p40
aVwe use just seven of them.
p41
aa(lp42
VThat's my dad.
p43
aVHe's the one who got me building with bamboo,
p44
aVand he is standing in a clump
p45
aVof Dendrocalamus asper niger that he planted just seven years ago.
p46
aVEach year, it sends up a new generation of shoots.
p47
aVThat shoot, we watched it grow a meter in three days just last week,
p48
aVso we're talking about sustainable timber in three years.
p49
aa(lp50
VNow, we harvest from hundreds of family-owned clumps.
p51
aVBetung, as we call it, it's really long,
p52
aVup to 18 meters of usable length.
p53
aVTry getting that truck down the mountain.
p54
aVAnd it's strong: it has the tensile strength of steel,
p55
aVthe compressive strength of concrete.
p56
aVSlam four tons straight down on a pole,
p57
aVand it can take it.
p58
aVBecause it's hollow, it's lightweight,
p59
aVlight enough to be lifted by just a few men,
p60
aVor, apparently, one woman.
p61
aa(lp62
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p63
aa(lp64
VAnd when my father built Green School in Bali,
p65
aVhe chose bamboo for all of the buildings on campus,
p66
aVbecause he saw it as a promise.
p67
aVIt's a promise to the kids.
p68
aVIt's one sustainable material that they will not run out of.
p69
aVAnd when I first saw these structures under construction about six years ago,
p70
aVI just thought, this makes perfect sense.
p71
aVIt is growing all around us.
p72
aVIt's strong. It's elegant.
p73
aVIt's earthquake-resistant.
p74
aVWhy hasn't this happened sooner, and what can we do with it next?
p75
aa(lp76
VSo along with some of the original builders of Green School,
p77
aVI founded Ibuku.
p78
aVIbu means "mother," and ku means "mine," so it represents my Mother Earth,
p79
aVand at Ibuku, we are a team of artisans, architects and designers,
p80
aVand what we're doing together is creating a new way of building.
p81
aVOver the past five years together,
p82
aVwe have built over 50 unique structures, most of them in Bali.
p83
aVNine of them are at Green Village \u2014
p84
aVyou've just seen inside some of these homes \u2014
p85
aVand we fill them with bespoke furniture,
p86
aVwe surround them with veggie gardens,
p87
aVwe would love to invite you all to come visit someday.
p88
aVAnd while you're there, you can also see Green School \u2014
p89
aVwe keep building classrooms there each year \u2014
p90
aVas well as an updated fairy mushroom house.
p91
aa(lp92
VWe're also working on a little house for export.
p93
aVThis is a traditional Sumbanese home that we replicated,
p94
aVright down to the details and textiles.
p95
aVA restaurant with an open-air kitchen.
p96
aVIt looks a lot like a kitchen, right?
p97
aVAnd a bridge that spans 22 meters across a river.
p98
aa(lp99
VNow, what we're doing, it's not entirely new.
p100
aVFrom little huts to elaborate bridges like this one in Java,
p101
aVbamboo has been in use across the tropical regions of the world
p102
aVfor literally tens of thousands of years.
p103
aVThere are islands and even continents that were first reached by bamboo rafts.
p104
aVBut until recently,
p105
aVit was almost impossible to reliably protect bamboo from insects,
p106
aVand so, just about everything that was ever built out of bamboo is gone.
p107
aVUnprotected bamboo weathers.
p108
aVUntreated bamboo gets eaten to dust.
p109
aVAnd so that's why most people, especially in Asia,
p110
aVthink that you couldn't be poor enough or rural enough to actually want
p111
aVto live in a bamboo house.
p112
aa(lp113
VAnd so we thought,
p114
aVwhat will it take to change their minds,
p115
aVto convince people that bamboo is worth building with,
p116
aVmuch less worth aspiring to?
p117
aa(lp118
VFirst, we needed safe treatment solutions.
p119
aVBorax is a natural salt.
p120
aVIt turns bamboo into a viable building material.
p121
aVTreat it properly, design it carefully,
p122
aVand a bamboo structure can last a lifetime.
p123
aa(lp124
VSecond, build something extraordinary out of it.
p125
aVInspire people.
p126
aVFortunately,
p127
aVBalinese culture fosters craftsmanship.
p128
aVIt values the artisan.
p129
aVSo combine those with the adventurous outliers
p130
aVfrom new generations of locally trained architects
p131
aVand designers and engineers,
p132
aVand always remember that you are designing
p133
aVfor curving, tapering, hollow poles.
p134
aVNo two poles alike, no straight lines,
p135
aVno two-by-fours here.
p136
aVThe tried-and-true, well-crafted formulas and vocabulary of architecture
p137
aVdo not apply here.
p138
aVWe have had to invent our own rules.
p139
aVWe ask the bamboo what it's good at, what it wants to become,
p140
aVand what it says is: respect it, design for its strengths,
p141
aVprotect it from water, and to make the most of its curves.
p142
aa(lp143
VSo we design in real 3D,
p144
aVmaking scale structural models
p145
aVout of the same material that we'll later use to build the house.
p146
aVAnd bamboo model-making, it's an art,
p147
aVas well as some hardcore engineering.
p148
aa(lp149
VSo that's the blueprint of the house.
p150
aa(lp151
V(Laughter)
p152
aa(lp153
VAnd we bring it to site,
p154
aVand with tiny rulers, we measure each pole,
p155
aVand consider each curve, and we choose a piece of bamboo from the pile
p156
aVto replicate that house on site.
p157
aa(lp158
VWhen it comes down to the details, we consider everything.
p159
aVWhy are doors so often rectangular?
p160
aVWhy not round?
p161
aVHow could you make a door better?
p162
aVWell, its hinges battle with gravity,
p163
aVand gravity will always win in the end,
p164
aVso why not have it pivot on the center
p165
aVwhere it can stay balanced?
p166
aVAnd while you're at it, why not doors shaped like teardrops?
p167
aa(lp168
VTo reap the selective benefits and work within the constraints
p169
aVof this material,
p170
aVwe have really had to push ourselves,
p171
aVand within that constraint, we have found space for something new.
p172
aVIt's a challenge: how do you make a ceiling
p173
aVif you don't have any flat boards to work with?
p174
aVLet me tell you, sometimes I dream of sheet rock and plywood.
p175
aV(Laughter)
p176
aVBut if what you've got is skilled craftsmen
p177
aVand itsy bitsy little splits,
p178
aVweave that ceiling together,
p179
aVstretch a canvas over it, lacquer it.
p180
aVHow do you design durable kitchen countertops
p181
aVthat do justice to this curving structure you've just built?
p182
aVSlice up a boulder like a loaf of bread,
p183
aVhand-carve each to fit the other,
p184
aVleave the crusts on,
p185
aVand what we're doing, it is almost entirely handmade.
p186
aVThe structural connections of our buildings
p187
aVare reinforced by steel joints, but we use a lot of hand-whittled bamboo pins.
p188
aVThere are thousands of pins in each floor.
p189
aVThis floor is made of glossy and durable bamboo skin.
p190
aVYou can feel the texture under bare feet.
p191
aa(lp192
VAnd the floor that you walk on,
p193
aVcan it affect the way that you walk?
p194
aVCan it change the footprint that you'll ultimately leave on the world?
p195
aVI remember being nine years old
p196
aVand feeling wonder,
p197
aVand possibility,
p198
aVand a little bit of idealism.
p199
aVAnd we've got a really long way to go,
p200
aVthere's a lot left to learn,
p201
aVbut one thing I know is that with creativity and commitment,
p202
aVyou can create beauty and comfort
p203
aVand safety and even luxury
p204
aVout of a material that will grow back.
p205
