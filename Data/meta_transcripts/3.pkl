VA public, Dewey long ago observed,
p4
aVis constituted through discussion and debate.
p5
aVIf we are to call the tyranny of assumptions into question,
p6
aVand avoid doxa, the realm of the unquestioned,
p7
aVthen we must be willing to subject our own assumptions
p8
aVto debate and discussion.
p9
aVIt is in this spirit that I join into a discussion
p10
aVof one of the critical issues of our time,
p11
aVnamely, how to mobilize different forms of capital
p12
aVfor the project of state building.
p13
aa(lp14
VTo put the assumptions very clearly:
p15
aVcapitalism, after 150 years, has become acceptable,
p16
aVand so has democracy.
p17
aVIf we looked in the world of 1945
p18
aVand looked at the map of capitalist economies and democratic polities,
p19
aVthey were the rare exception, not the norm.
p20
aVThe question now, however,
p21
aVis both about which form of capitalism
p22
aVand which type of democratic participation.
p23
aVBut we must acknowledge
p24
aVthat this moment has brought about
p25
aVa rare consensus of assumptions.
p26
aVAnd that provides the ground
p27
aVfor a type of action,
p28
aVbecause consensus of each moment
p29
aVallows us to act.
p30
aVAnd it is necessary, no matter how fragile
p31
aVor how provisional our consensus,
p32
aVto be able to move forward.
p33
aa(lp34
VBut the majority of the world
p35
aVneither benefits from capitalism
p36
aVnor from democratic systems.
p37
aVMost of the globe
p38
aVexperiences the state as repressive,
p39
aVas an organization that is concerned
p40
aVabout denial of rights,
p41
aVabout denial of justice,
p42
aVrather than provision of it.
p43
aVAnd in terms of experience of capitalism,
p44
aVthere are two aspects
p45
aVthat the rest of the globe experiences.
p46
aVFirst, extractive industry.
p47
aVBlood diamonds, smuggled emeralds,
p48
aVtimber,
p49
aVthat is cut right from under the poorest.
p50
aVSecond is technical assistance.
p51
aVAnd technical assistance might shock you,
p52
aVbut it's the worst form
p53
aVof \u2014 today \u2014 of the ugly face
p54
aVof the developed world to the developing countries.
p55
aVTens of billions of dollars
p56
aVare supposedly spent on building capacity
p57
aVwith people who are paid up to 1,500 dollars a day,
p58
aVwho are incapable
p59
aVof thinking creatively,
p60
aVor organically.
p61
aa(lp62
VNext assumption \u2014
p63
aVand of course the events of July 7,
p64
aVI express my deep sympathy, and before that, September 11 \u2014
p65
aVhave reminded us
p66
aVwe do not live in three different worlds.
p67
aVWe live in one world.
p68
aVBut that's easily said.
p69
aVBut we are not dealing with the implications
p70
aVof the one world that we are living in.
p71
aVAnd that is that if we want to have one world,
p72
aVthis one world cannot be based
p73
aVon huge pockets of exclusion,
p74
aVand then inclusion for some.
p75
aVWe must now finally come
p76
aVto think about the premises
p77
aVof a truly global world,
p78
aVin relationship to the regime of rights
p79
aVand responsibilities and accountabilities
p80
aVthat are truly global in scope.
p81
aVOtherwise we will be missing
p82
aVthis open moment in history,
p83
aVwhere we have a consensus
p84
aVon both the form of politics
p85
aVand the form of economics.
p86
aa(lp87
VWhat is one of these organizations to pick?
p88
aVWe have three critical terms:
p89
aVeconomy,
p90
aVcivil society
p91
aVand the state.
p92
aVI will not deal with those first two, except to say
p93
aVthat uncritical transfer of assumptions,
p94
aVfrom one context to another,
p95
aVcan only make for disaster.
p96
aVEconomics
p97
aVtaught in most of the elite universities
p98
aVare practically useless in my context.
p99
aVMy country is dominated
p100
aVby drug economy and a mafia.
p101
aVTextbook economics does not work in my context,
p102
aVand I have very few recommendations from anybody
p103
aVas to how to put together a legal economy.
p104
aVThe poverty of our knowledge
p105
aVmust become the first basis
p106
aVof moving forward,
p107
aVand not imposition of the framework
p108
aVthat works on the basis of mathematical modeling,
p109
aVfor which I have enormous respect.
p110
aVMy colleagues at Johns Hopkins were among the best.
p111
aa(lp112
VSecond,
p113
aVinstead of debating endlessly
p114
aVabout what is the structure of the state,
p115
aVwhy don't we simplify
p116
aVand say, what are a series of functions
p117
aVthat the state in the 21st century must perform?
p118
aVClare Lockhart and I are writing a book on this;
p119
aVwe hope to share that much widely with \u2014
p120
aVand third is that we could actually construct an index
p121
aVto measure comparatively
p122
aVhow well these functions that we would agree on
p123
aVare being performed in different places.
p124
aa(lp125
VSo what are these functions?
p126
aVWe propose 10.
p127
aVAnd it's legitimate monopoly of means of violence,
p128
aVadministrative control, management of public finances,
p129
aVinvestment in human capital, provision of citizenship rights,
p130
aVprovision of infrastructure,
p131
aVmanagement of the tangible and intangible assets of the state
p132
aVthrough regulation, creation of the market,
p133
aVinternational agreements, including public borrowing,
p134
aVand then, most importantly, rule of law.
p135
aa(lp136
VI won't elaborate.
p137
aVI hope the questions will give me an opportunity.
p138
aVThis is a feasible goal,
p139
aVbasically because, contrary to widespread assumption,
p140
aVI would argue that we know how to do this.
p141
aVWho would have imagined that Germany
p142
aVwould be either united or democratic today,
p143
aVif you looked at it from the perspective of Oxford of 1943?
p144
aVBut people at Oxford prepared for a democratic Germany
p145
aVand engaged in planning.
p146
aVAnd there are lots of other examples.
p147
aa(lp148
VNow in order to do this \u2014 and this brings this group \u2014
p149
aVwe have to rethink the notion of capital.
p150
aVThe least important form of capital, in this project,
p151
aVis financial capital \u2014 money.
p152
aVMoney is not capital in most of the developing countries.
p153
aVIt's just cash.
p154
aVBecause it lacks the institutional,
p155
aVorganizational, managerial forms
p156
aVto turn it into capital.
p157
aVAnd what is required
p158
aVis a combination of physical capital,
p159
aVinstitutional capital, human capital \u2014
p160
aVand security, of course, is critical,
p161
aVbut so is information.
p162
aa(lp163
VNow, the issue that should concern us here \u2014
p164
aVand that's the challenge
p165
aVthat I would like to pose to this group \u2014
p166
aVis again, it takes 16 years
p167
aVin your countries
p168
aVto produce somebody with a B.S. degree.
p169
aVIt takes 20 years
p170
aVto produce somebody with a Ph.D.
p171
aVThe first challenge is to rethink,
p172
aVfundamentally,
p173
aVthe issue of the time.
p174
aVDo we need to repeat
p175
aVthe modalities that we have inherited?
p176
aVOur educational systems are inherited from the 19th century.
p177
aVWhat is it that we need to do fundamentally
p178
aVto re-engage in a project,
p179
aVthat capital formation is rapid?
p180
aVThe absolute majority of the world's population
p181
aVare below 20,
p182
aVand they are growing larger and faster.
p183
aVThey need different ways
p184
aVof being approached,
p185
aVdifferent ways of being enfranchised,
p186
aVdifferent ways of being skilled.
p187
aVAnd that's the first thing.
p188
aa(lp189
VSecond is, you're problem solvers,
p190
aVbut you're not engaging your global responsibility.
p191
aVYou've stayed away
p192
aVfrom the problems of corruption.
p193
aVYou only want clean environments in which to function.
p194
aVBut if you don't think through the problems of corruption,
p195
aVwho will?
p196
aVYou stay away from design for development.
p197
aVYou're great designers,
p198
aVbut your designs are selfish.
p199
aVIt's for your own immediate use.
p200
aVThe world in which I operate
p201
aVoperates with designs
p202
aVregarding roads, or dams,
p203
aVor provision of electricity
p204
aVthat have not been revisited in 60 years.
p205
aVThis is not right. It requires thinking.
p206
aa(lp207
VBut, particularly, what we need
p208
aVmore than anything else from this group
p209
aVis your imagination
p210
aVto be brought to bear on problems
p211
aVthe way a meme is supposed to work.
p212
aVAs the work on paradigms, long time ago showed \u2014
p213
aVThomas Kuhn's work \u2014
p214
aVit's in the intersection of ideas
p215
aVthat new developments \u2014
p216
aVtrue breakthroughs \u2014 occur.
p217
aVAnd I hope that this group
p218
aVwould be able to deal with the issue of state and development
p219
aVand the empowerment of the majority of the world's poor,
p220
aVthrough this means.
p221
aVThank you.
p222
aV(Applause)
p223
aa(lp224
VChris Anderson: So, Ashraf, until recently,
p225
aVyou were the finance minister of Afghanistan,
p226
aVa country right at the middle
p227
aVof much of the world's agenda.
p228
aVIs the country gonna make it?
p229
aVWill democracy flourish? What scares you most?
p230
aa(lp231
VAshraf Ghani: What scares me most is \u2014 is you,
p232
aVlack of your engagement.
p233
aV(Laughter)
p234
aVYou asked me. You know I always give the unconventional answer.
p235
aVNo. But seriously,
p236
aVthe issue of Afghanistan
p237
aVfirst has to be seen as,
p238
aVat least, a 10- to 20-year perspective.
p239
aVToday the world of globalization
p240
aVis on speed.
p241
aVTime has been compressed.
p242
aVAnd space does not exist for most people.
p243
aVBut in my world \u2014
p244
aVyou know, when I went back to Afghanistan after 23 years,
p245
aVspace had expanded.
p246
aVEvery conceivable form of infrastructure had broken down.
p247
aVI rode \u2014 traveled \u2014
p248
aVtravel between two cities that used to take three hours
p249
aVnow took 12.
p250
aVSo the first is when the scale is that,
p251
aVwe need to recognize
p252
aVthat just the simple things that are infrastructure \u2014
p253
aVit takes six years to deliver infrastructure.
p254
aVIn our world.
p255
aVAny meaningful sort of thing.
p256
aVBut the modality of attention,
p257
aVor what is happening today, what's happening tomorrow.
p258
aa(lp259
VSecond is,
p260
aVwhen a country has been subjected
p261
aVto one of the most immense, brutal forms of exercise of power \u2014
p262
aVwe had the Red Army
p263
aVfor 10 continuous years,
p264
aV110,000 strong,
p265
aVliterally terrorizing.
p266
aVThe sky:
p267
aVevery Afghan
p268
aVsees the sky as a source of fear.
p269
aVWe were bombed
p270
aVpractically out of existence.
p271
aVThen, tens of thousands of people were trained in terrorism \u2014
p272
aVfrom all sides.
p273
aVThe United States, Great Britain, joined for instance,
p274
aVEgyptian intelligence service
p275
aVto train thousands of people
p276
aVin resistance and urban terrorism.
p277
aVHow to turn a bicycle
p278
aVinto an instrument of terror.
p279
aVHow to turn a donkey, a carthorse, anything.
p280
aVAnd the Russians, equally.
p281
aVSo, when violence erupts
p282
aVin a country like Afghanistan,
p283
aVit's because of that legacy.
p284
aVBut we have to understand
p285
aVthat we've been incredibly lucky.
p286
aVI mean, I really can't believe how lucky I am here,
p287
aVstanding in front of you, speaking.
p288
aVWhen I joined as finance minister,
p289
aVI thought that the chances of my living more than three years
p290
aVwould not be more than five percent.
p291
aVThose were the risks. They were worth it.
p292
aa(lp293
VI think we can make it,
p294
aVand the reason we can make it
p295
aVis because of the people.
p296
aVYou see, because, I mean \u2014 I give you one statistic.
p297
aV91 percent of the men in Afghanistan,
p298
aV86 percent of the women,
p299
aVlisten to at least three radio stations a day.
p300
aVIn terms of their discourse,
p301
aVin terms of their sophistication of knowledge of the world,
p302
aVI think that I would dare say,
p303
aVthey're much more sophisticated
p304
aVthan rural Americans with college degrees
p305
aVand the bulk of Europeans \u2014
p306
aVbecause the world matters to them.
p307
aVAnd what is their predominant concern?
p308
aVAbandonment.
p309
aVAfghans have become deeply internationalist.
p310
aa(lp311
VYou know, when I went back in December of 2001,
p312
aVI had absolutely no desire to work with the Afghan government
p313
aVbecause I'd lived as a nationalist.
p314
aVAnd I told them \u2014 my people, with the Americans here \u2014
p315
aVseparate.
p316
aVYes, I have an advisory position with the U.N.
p317
aVI went through 10 Afghan provinces very rapidly.
p318
aVAnd everybody was telling me it was a different world.
p319
aVYou know, they engage.
p320
aVThey see engagement, global engagement,
p321
aVas absolutely necessary to the future of the ordinary people.
p322
aVAnd the thing that the ordinary Afghan is most concerned with is \u2014
p323
aVClare Lockhart is here,
p324
aVso I'll recite a discussion she had
p325
aVwith an illiterate woman in Northern Afghanistan.
p326
aVAnd that woman said she didn't care
p327
aVwhether she had food on her table.
p328
aVWhat she worried about was whether there was a plan for the future,
p329
aVwhere her children could really have a different life.
p330
aVThat gives me hope.
p331
aVCA: How is Afghanistan
p332
aVgoing to provide alternative income
p333
aVto the many people
p334
aVwho are making their living off the drugs trade?
p335
aa(lp336
VAG: Certainly. Well, the first is,
p337
aVinstead of sending a billion dollars
p338
aVon drug eradication
p339
aVand paying it to a couple of security companies,
p340
aVthey should give this hundred billion dollars
p341
aVto 50
p342
aVof the most critically innovative companies in the world
p343
aVto ask them to create one million jobs.
p344
aVThe key to the drug eradication is jobs.
p345
aVLook, there's a very little known fact:
p346
aVcountries that have a legal average income per capita of 1,000 dollars
p347
aVdon't produce drugs.
p348
aa(lp349
VSecond, textile.
p350
aVTrade is the key, not aid.
p351
aVThe U.S. and Europe
p352
aVshould give us a zero percent tariff.
p353
aVThe textile industry is incredibly mobile.
p354
aVIf you want us to be able to compete with China and to attract investment,
p355
aVwe could probably attract
p356
aVfour to six billion dollars
p357
aVquite easily in the textile sector,
p358
aVif there was zero tariffs \u2014
p359
aVwould create the type of job.
p360
aVCotton does not compete with opium;
p361
aVa t-shirt does.
p362
aVAnd we need to understand, it's the value chain.
p363
aVLook, the ordinary Afghan is sick and tired
p364
aVof hearing about microcredit.
p365
aVIt is important,
p366
aVbut what the ordinary women and men who engage in micro-production want
p367
aVis global access.
p368
aVThey don't want to sell to the charity bazaars
p369
aVthat are only for foreigners \u2014
p370
aVand the same bloody shirt
p371
aVembroidered time and again.
p372
aVWhat we want is a partnership
p373
aVwith the Italian design firms.
p374
aVYeah, we have the best embroiderers in the world!
p375
aVWhy can't we do what was done with northern Italy?
p376
aVWith the Put Out system?
p377
aVSo I think economically,
p378
aVthe critical issue really is to now think through.
p379
aa(lp380
VAnd what I will say here is that aid doesn't work.
p381
aVYou know, the aid system is broken.
p382
aVThe aid system does not have the knowledge,
p383
aVthe vision, the ability.
p384
aVI'm all for it; after all, I raised a lot of it.
p385
aVYeah, to be exact, you know,
p386
aVI managed to persuade the world that
p387
aVthey had to give my country 27.5 billion.
p388
aVThey didn't want to give us the money.
p389
aa(lp390
VCA: And it still didn't work?
p391
aa(lp392
VAG: No. It's not that it didn't work.
p393
aVIt's that a dollar of private investment,
p394
aVin my judgment,
p395
aVis equal at least to 20 dollars of aid,
p396
aVin terms of the dynamic that it generates.
p397
aVSecond is that one dollar of aid could be 10 cents;
p398
aVit could be 20 cents;
p399
aVor it could be four dollars.
p400
aVIt depends on what form it comes,
p401
aVwhat degrees of conditionalities are attached to it.
p402
aVYou know, the aid system, at first, was designed to benefit
p403
aVentrepreneurs of the developed countries,
p404
aVnot to generate growth in the poor countries.
p405
aVAnd this is, again, one of those assumptions \u2014
p406
aVthe way car seats are an assumption
p407
aVthat we've inherited in governments, and doors.
p408
aVYou would think that the US government
p409
aVwould not think that American firms needed subsidizing
p410
aVto function in developing countries, provide advice,
p411
aVbut they do.
p412
aVThere's an entire weight of history
p413
aVvis-a-vis aid
p414
aVthat now needs to be reexamined.
p415
aVIf the goal is to build states
p416
aVthat can credibly take care of themselves \u2014
p417
aVand I'm putting that proposition equally;
p418
aVyou know I'm very harsh on my counterparts \u2014
p419
aVaid must end
p420
aVin each country in a definable period.
p421
aVAnd every year there must be progress
p422
aVon mobilization of domestic revenue
p423
aVand generation of the economy.
