VI have a friend in Portugal
p4
aVwhose grandfather built a vehicle out of a bicycle
p5
aVand a washing machine so he could transport his family.
p6
aVHe did it because he couldn't afford a car,
p7
aVbut also because he knew how to build one.
p8
aVThere was a time when we understood how things worked
p9
aVand how they were made, so we could build and repair them,
p10
aVor at the very least
p11
aVmake informed decisions about what to buy.
p12
aVMany of these do-it-yourself practices
p13
aVwere lost in the second half of the 20th century.
p14
aVBut now, the maker community and the open-source model
p15
aVare bringing this kind of knowledge about how things work
p16
aVand what they're made of back into our lives,
p17
aVand I believe we need to take them to the next level,
p18
aVto the components things are made of.
p19
aa(lp20
VFor the most part, we still know
p21
aVwhat traditional materials like paper and textiles are made of
p22
aVand how they are produced.
p23
aVBut now we have these amazing, futuristic composites \u2014
p24
aVplastics that change shape,
p25
aVpaints that conduct electricity,
p26
aVpigments that change color, fabrics that light up.
p27
aVLet me show you some examples.
p28
aa(lp29
VSo conductive ink allows us to paint circuits
p30
aVinstead of using the traditional
p31
aVprinted circuit boards or wires.
p32
aVIn the case of this little example I'm holding,
p33
aVwe used it to create a touch sensor that reacts to my skin
p34
aVby turning on this little light.
p35
aVConductive ink has been used by artists,
p36
aVbut recent developments indicate that we will soon be able
p37
aVto use it in laser printers and pens.
p38
aVAnd this is a sheet of acrylic infused
p39
aVwith colorless light-diffusing particles.
p40
aVWhat this means is that, while regular acrylic
p41
aVonly diffuses light around the edges,
p42
aVthis one illuminates across the entire surface
p43
aVwhen I turn on the lights around it.
p44
aVTwo of the known applications for this material
p45
aVinclude interior design and multi-touch systems.
p46
aVAnd thermochromic pigments
p47
aVchange color at a given temperature.
p48
aVSo I'm going to place this on a hot plate
p49
aVthat is set to a temperature only slightly higher than ambient
p50
aVand you can see what happens.
p51
aVSo one of the principle applications for this material
p52
aVis, amongst other things, in baby bottles,
p53
aVso it indicates when the contents are cool enough to drink.
p54
aa(lp55
VSo these are just a few of what are commonly known
p56
aVas smart materials.
p57
aVIn a few years, they will be in many of the objects
p58
aVand technologies we use on a daily basis.
p59
aVWe may not yet have the flying cars science fiction promised us,
p60
aVbut we can have walls that change color
p61
aVdepending on temperature,
p62
aVkeyboards that roll up,
p63
aVand windows that become opaque at the flick of a switch.
p64
aa(lp65
VSo I'm a social scientist by training,
p66
aVso why am I here today talking about smart materials?
p67
aVWell first of all, because I am a maker.
p68
aVI'm curious about how things work
p69
aVand how they are made,
p70
aVbut also because I believe we should have a deeper understanding
p71
aVof the components that make up our world,
p72
aVand right now, we don't know enough about
p73
aVthese high-tech composites our future will be made of.
p74
aVSmart materials are hard to obtain in small quantities.
p75
aVThere's barely any information available on how to use them,
p76
aVand very little is said about how they are produced.
p77
aVSo for now, they exist mostly in this realm
p78
aVof trade secrets and patents
p79
aVonly universities and corporations have access to.
p80
aa(lp81
VSo a little over three years ago, Kirsty Boyle and I
p82
aVstarted a project we called Open Materials.
p83
aVIt's a website where we,
p84
aVand anyone else who wants to join us,
p85
aVshare experiments, publish information,
p86
aVencourage others to contribute whenever they can,
p87
aVand aggregate resources such as research papers
p88
aVand tutorials by other makers like ourselves.
p89
aVWe would like it to become a large,
p90
aVcollectively generated database
p91
aVof do-it-yourself information on smart materials.
p92
aa(lp93
VBut why should we care
p94
aVhow smart materials work and what they are made of?
p95
aVFirst of all, because we can't shape what we don't understand,
p96
aVand what we don't understand and use
p97
aVends up shaping us.
p98
aVThe objects we use, the clothes we wear,
p99
aVthe houses we live in, all have a profound impact
p100
aVon our behavior, health and quality of life.
p101
aVSo if we are to live in a world made of smart materials,
p102
aVwe should know and understand them.
p103
aVSecondly, and just as important,
p104
aVinnovation has always been fueled by tinkerers.
p105
aVSo many times, amateurs, not experts,
p106
aVhave been the inventors and improvers
p107
aVof things ranging from mountain bikes
p108
aVto semiconductors, personal computers,
p109
aVairplanes.
p110
aa(lp111
VThe biggest challenge is that material science is complex
p112
aVand requires expensive equipment.
p113
aVBut that's not always the case.
p114
aVTwo scientists at University of Illinois understood this
p115
aVwhen they published a paper on a simpler method
p116
aVfor making conductive ink.
p117
aVJordan Bunker, who had had
p118
aVno experience with chemistry until then,
p119
aVread this paper and reproduced the experiment
p120
aVat his maker space using only off-the-shelf substances
p121
aVand tools.
p122
aVHe used a toaster oven,
p123
aVand he even made his own vortex mixer,
p124
aVbased on a tutorial by another scientist/maker.
p125
aVJordan then published his results online,
p126
aVincluding all the things he had tried and didn't work,
p127
aVso others could study and reproduce it.
p128
aVSo Jordan's main form of innovation
p129
aVwas to take an experiment created in a well-equipped lab
p130
aVat the university
p131
aVand recreate it in a garage in Chicago
p132
aVusing only cheap materials and tools he made himself.
p133
aVAnd now that he published this work,
p134
aVothers can pick up where he left
p135
aVand devise even simpler processes and improvements.
p136
aa(lp137
VAnother example I'd like to mention
p138
aVis Hannah Perner-Wilson's Kit-of-No-Parts.
p139
aVHer project's goal is to highlight
p140
aVthe expressive qualities of materials
p141
aVwhile focusing on the creativity and skills of the builder.
p142
aVElectronics kits are very powerful
p143
aVin that they teach us how things work,
p144
aVbut the constraints inherent in their design
p145
aVinfluence the way we learn.
p146
aVSo Hannah's approach, on the other hand,
p147
aVis to formulate a series of techniques
p148
aVfor creating unusual objects
p149
aVthat free us from pre-designed constraints
p150
aVby teaching us about the materials themselves.
p151
aVSo amongst Hannah's many impressive experiments,
p152
aVthis is one of my favorites.
p153
aV["Paper speakers"]
p154
aVWhat we're seeing here is just a piece of paper
p155
aVwith some copper tape on it connected to an mp3 player
p156
aVand a magnet.
p157
aV(Music: "Happy Together")
p158
aVSo based on the research by Marcelo Coelho from MIT,
p159
aVHannah created a series of paper speakers
p160
aVout of a wide range of materials
p161
aVfrom simple copper tape to conductive fabric and ink.
p162
aVJust like Jordan and so many other makers,
p163
aVHannah published her recipes
p164
aVand allows anyone to copy and reproduce them.
p165
aa(lp166
VBut paper electronics is one of the most promising branches
p167
aVof material science
p168
aVin that it allows us to create cheaper and flexible electronics.
p169
aVSo Hannah's artisanal work,
p170
aVand the fact that she shared her findings,
p171
aVopens the doors to a series of new possibilities
p172
aVthat are both aesthetically appealing and innovative.
p173
aa(lp174
VSo the interesting thing about makers
p175
aVis that we create out of passion and curiosity,
p176
aVand we are not afraid to fail.
p177
aVWe often tackle problems from unconventional angles,
p178
aVand, in the process, end up discovering alternatives
p179
aVor even better ways to do things.
p180
aVSo the more people experiment with materials,
p181
aVthe more researchers are willing to share their research,
p182
aVand manufacturers their knowledge,
p183
aVthe better chances we have to create technologies
p184
aVthat truly serve us all.
p185
aa(lp186
VSo I feel a bit as Ted Nelson must have
p187
aVwhen, in the early 1970s, he wrote,
p188
aV"You must understand computers now."
p189
aVBack then, computers were these large mainframes
p190
aVonly scientists cared about,
p191
aVand no one dreamed of even having one at home.
p192
aVSo it's a little strange that I'm standing here and saying,
p193
aV"You must understand smart materials now."
p194
aVJust keep in mind that acquiring preemptive knowledge
p195
aVabout emerging technologies
p196
aVis the best way to ensure that we have a say
p197
aVin the making of our future.
p198
