VOkay, so
p4
aV90 percent of my photographic process
p5
aVis, in fact, not photographic.
p6
aVIt involves a campaign of letter writing,
p7
aVresearch and phone calls
p8
aVto access my subjects,
p9
aVwhich can range from Hamas leaders in Gaza
p10
aVto a hibernating black bear in its cave
p11
aVin West Virginia.
p12
aVAnd oddly, the most notable
p13
aVletter of rejection I ever received
p14
aVcame from Walt Disney World,
p15
aVa seemingly innocuous site.
p16
aa(lp17
VAnd it read \u2014 I'm just going to read a key sentence:
p18
aV"Especially during these violent times,
p19
aVI personally believe
p20
aVthat the magical spell cast upon guests who visit our theme parks
p21
aVis particularly important to protect
p22
aVand helps to provide them with an important fantasy
p23
aVthey can escape to."
p24
aa(lp25
VPhotography threatens fantasy.
p26
aVThey didn't want to let my camera in
p27
aVbecause it confronts constructed realities, myths and beliefs,
p28
aVand provides what appears to be
p29
aVevidence of a truth.
p30
aVBut there are multiple truths attached to every image,
p31
aVdepending on the creator's intention, the viewer
p32
aVand the context in which it is presented.
p33
aa(lp34
VOver a five year period following September 11th,
p35
aVwhen the American media and government were seeking
p36
aVhidden and unknown sites
p37
aVbeyond its borders,
p38
aVmost notably weapons of mass destruction,
p39
aVI chose to look inward at that which was integral
p40
aVto America's foundation,
p41
aVmythology and daily functioning.
p42
aVI wanted to confront the boundaries of the citizen,
p43
aVself-imposed and real,
p44
aVand confront the divide between privileged
p45
aVand public access to knowledge.
p46
aa(lp47
VIt was a critical moment in American history
p48
aVand global history
p49
aVwhere one felt they didn't have access to accurate information.
p50
aVAnd I wanted to see the center with my own eyes,
p51
aVbut what I came away with is a photograph.
p52
aVAnd it's just another place from which to observe,
p53
aVand the understanding that
p54
aVthere are no absolute, all-knowing insiders.
p55
aVAnd the outsider can never really reach the core.
p56
aa(lp57
VI'm going to run through some of the photographs in this series.
p58
aVIt's titled, "An American Index
p59
aVof the Hidden and Unfamiliar,"
p60
aVand it's comprised of nearly 70 images.
p61
aVIn this context I'll just show you a few.
p62
aVThis is a nuclear waste storage and encapsulation facility
p63
aVat Hanford site in Washington State,
p64
aVwhere there are over 1,900
p65
aVstainless steel capsules containing nuclear waste
p66
aVsubmerged in water.
p67
aVA human standing in front of an unprotected capsule would die instantly.
p68
aVAnd I found one section amongst all of these
p69
aVthat actually resembled the outline
p70
aVof the United States of America,
p71
aVwhich you can see here.
p72
aa(lp73
VAnd a big part of the work that is
p74
aVsort of absent in this context is text.
p75
aVSo I create these two poles.
p76
aVEvery image is accompanied with a very detailed factual text.
p77
aVAnd what I'm most interested in
p78
aVis the invisible space between a text
p79
aVand its accompanying image,
p80
aVand how the image is transformed by the text
p81
aVand the text by the image.
p82
aVSo, at best, the image is meant to float away
p83
aVinto abstraction and multiple truths and fantasy.
p84
aVAnd then the text functions as this cruel anchor
p85
aVthat kind of nails it to the ground.
p86
aVBut in this context I'm just going to read
p87
aVan abridged version of those texts.
p88
aa(lp89
VThis is a cryopreservation unit,
p90
aVand it holds the bodies of the wife and mother
p91
aVof cryonics pioneer Robert Ettinger,
p92
aVwho hoped to be awoken one day to extended life
p93
aVin good health, with advancements in science and technology,
p94
aVall for the cost of 35 thousand dollars, for forever.
p95
aa(lp96
VThis is a 21-year-old Palestinian woman
p97
aVundergoing hymenoplasty.
p98
aVHymenoplasty is a surgical procedure which restores the virginal state,
p99
aVallowing her to adhere to certain cultural expectations
p100
aVregarding virginity and marriage.
p101
aVSo it essentially reconstructs a ruptured hymen,
p102
aVallowing her to bleed upon having sexual intercourse,
p103
aVto simulate the loss of virginity.
p104
aa(lp105
VThis is a jury simulation deliberation room,
p106
aVand you can see beyond that two-way mirror
p107
aVjury advisers standing in a room behind the mirror.
p108
aVAnd they observe deliberations
p109
aVafter mock trial proceedings
p110
aVso that they can better advise their clients how to adjust their trial strategy
p111
aVto have the outcome that they're hoping for.
p112
aVThis process costs 60,000 dollars.
p113
aa(lp114
VThis is a U.S. Customs and Border Protection room,
p115
aVa contraband room, at John F. Kennedy International Airport.
p116
aVOn that table you can see 48 hours' worth
p117
aVof seized goods from passengers entering in to the United States.
p118
aVThere is a pig's head and African cane rats.
p119
aVAnd part of my photographic work
p120
aVis I'm not just documenting what's there.
p121
aVI do take certain liberties and intervene.
p122
aVAnd in this I really wanted it to resemble
p123
aVan early still-life painting,
p124
aVso I spent some time with the smells and items.
p125
aa(lp126
VThis is the exhibited art on the walls of the CIA
p127
aVin Langley, Virginia, their original headquarters building.
p128
aVAnd the CIA has had a long history
p129
aVwith both covert and public cultural diplomacy efforts.
p130
aVAnd it's speculated that some of their interest in the arts
p131
aVwas designed to counter Soviet communism
p132
aVand promote what it considered to be pro-American
p133
aVthoughts and aesthetics.
p134
aVAnd one of the art forms that elicited the interest of the agency,
p135
aVand had thus come under question, is abstract expressionism.
p136
aa(lp137
VThis is the Forensic Anthropology Research Facility,
p138
aVand on a six acre plot
p139
aVthere are approximately 75 cadavers at any given time
p140
aVthat are being studied by forensic anthropologists
p141
aVand researchers who are interested in monitoring
p142
aVa rate of corpse decomposition.
p143
aVAnd in this particular photograph the body of a young boy
p144
aVhas been used to reenact a crime scene.
p145
aa(lp146
VThis is the only federally funded site
p147
aVwhere it is legal to cultivate cannabis
p148
aVfor scientific research in the United States.
p149
aVIt's a research crop marijuana grow room.
p150
aa(lp151
VAnd part of the work that I hope for
p152
aVis that there is a sort of disorienting entropy
p153
aVwhere you can't find any discernible formula in how these things \u2014
p154
aVthey sort of awkwardly jump from government to science
p155
aVto religion to security \u2014
p156
aVand you can't completely understand
p157
aVhow information is being distributed.
p158
aa(lp159
VThese are transatlantic submarine communication cables
p160
aVthat travel across the floor of the Atlantic Ocean,
p161
aVconnecting North America to Europe.
p162
aVThey carry over 60 million simultaneous voice conversations,
p163
aVand in a lot of the government and technology sites
p164
aVthere was just this very apparent vulnerability.
p165
aVThis one is almost humorous because it feels like I could
p166
aVjust snip all of that conversation in one easy cut.
p167
aVBut stuff did feel like it could have been taken
p168
aV30 or 40 years ago, like it was locked in the Cold War era
p169
aVand hadn't necessarily progressed.
p170
aa(lp171
VThis is a Braille edition of Playboy magazine.
p172
aV(Laughter)
p173
aVAnd this is ... a division of the Library of Congress
p174
aVproduces a free national library service
p175
aVfor the blind and visually impaired,
p176
aVand the publications they choose to publish
p177
aVare based on reader popularity.
p178
aVAnd Playboy is always in the top few.
p179
aV(Laughter)
p180
aVBut you'd be surprised, they don't do the photographs. It's just the text.
p181
aV(Laughter)
p182
aa(lp183
VThis is an avian quarantine facility
p184
aVwhere all imported birds coming into America
p185
aVare required to undergo a 30-day quarantine,
p186
aVwhere they are tested for diseases
p187
aVincluding Exotic Newcastle Disease
p188
aVand Avian Influenza.
p189
aVThis film shows
p190
aVthe testing of a new explosive fill on a warhead.
p191
aVAnd the Air Armament Center
p192
aVat Eglin Air Force Base in Florida
p193
aVis responsible for the deployment and testing
p194
aVof all air-delivered weaponry
p195
aVcoming from the United States.
p196
aVAnd the film was shot on 72 millimeter, government-issue film.
p197
aVAnd that red dot is a marking on the government-issue film.
p198
aa(lp199
VAll living white tigers in North America
p200
aVare the result of selective inbreeding \u2014
p201
aVthat would be mother to son,
p202
aVfather to daughter, sister to brother \u2014
p203
aVto allow for the genetic conditions
p204
aVthat create a salable white tiger.
p205
aVMeaning white fur, ice blue eyes, a pink nose.
p206
aVAnd the majority of these white tigers
p207
aVare not born in a salable state
p208
aVand are killed at birth.
p209
aVIt's a very violent process that is little known.
p210
aVAnd the white tiger is obviously celebrated in several forms of entertainment.
p211
aVKenny was born. He actually made it to adulthood.
p212
aVHe has since passed away,
p213
aVbut was mentally retarded
p214
aVand suffers from severe bone abnormalities.
p215
aa(lp216
VThis, on a lighter note, is at
p217
aVGeorge Lucas' personal archive.
p218
aVThis is the Death Star.
p219
aVAnd it's shown here in its true orientation.
p220
aVIn the context of "Star Wars: Return of the Jedi,"
p221
aVits mirror image is presented.
p222
aVThey flip the negative.
p223
aVAnd you can see the photoetched brass detailing,
p224
aVand the painted acrylic facade.
p225
aVIn the context of the film,
p226
aVthis is a deep-space battle station of the Galactic Empire,
p227
aVcapable of annihilating planets and civilizations,
p228
aVand in reality it measures about four feet by two feet.
p229
aV(Laughter)
p230
aa(lp231
VThis is at Fort Campbell in Kentucky.
p232
aVIt's a Military Operations on Urbanized Terrain site.
p233
aVEssentially they've simulated a city
p234
aVfor urban combat,
p235
aVand this is one of the structures that exists in that city.
p236
aVIt's called the World Church of God.
p237
aVIt's supposed to be a generic site of worship.
p238
aVAnd after I took this photograph,
p239
aVthey constructed a wall around the World Church of God
p240
aVto mimic the set-up of mosques in Afghanistan or Iraq.
p241
aVAnd I worked with Mehta Vihar
p242
aVwho creates virtual simulations for the army
p243
aVfor tactical practice.
p244
aVAnd we put that wall around the World Church of God,
p245
aVand also used the characters and vehicles and explosions
p246
aVthat are offered in the video games for the army.
p247
aVAnd I put them into my photograph.
p248
aa(lp249
VThis is live HIV virus
p250
aVat Harvard Medical School, who is working with the U.S. Government
p251
aVto develop sterilizing immunity.
p252
aa(lp253
VAnd Alhurra is a U.S. Government- sponsored
p254
aVArabic language television network
p255
aVthat distributes news and information to over 22 countries in the Arab world.
p256
aVIt runs 24 hours a day, commercial free.
p257
aVHowever, it's illegal to broadcast Alhurra within the United States.
p258
aVAnd in 2004, they developed a channel called Alhurra Iraq,
p259
aVwhich specifically deals with events occurring in Iraq
p260
aVand is broadcast to Iraq.
p261
aa(lp262
VNow I'm going to move on to another project I did.
p263
aVIt's titled "The Innocents."
p264
aVAnd for the men in these photographs,
p265
aVphotography had been used to create a fantasy.
p266
aVContradicting its function as evidence of a truth,
p267
aVin these instances it furthered the fabrication of a lie.
p268
aVI traveled across the United States
p269
aVphotographing men and women who had been wrongfully convicted
p270
aVof crimes they did not commit, violent crimes.
p271
aa(lp272
VI investigate photography's ability to blur truth and fiction,
p273
aVand its influence on memory,
p274
aVwhich can lead to severe, even lethal consequences.
p275
aVFor the men in these photographs,
p276
aVthe primary cause of their wrongful conviction
p277
aVwas mistaken identification.
p278
aVA victim or eyewitness identifies
p279
aVa suspected perpetrator
p280
aVthrough law enforcement's use of images.
p281
aVBut through exposure to composite sketches,
p282
aVPolaroids, mug shots and line-ups,
p283
aVeyewitness testimony can change.
p284
aa(lp285
VI'll give you an example from a case.
p286
aVA woman was raped and presented with a series of photographs
p287
aVfrom which to identify her attacker.
p288
aVShe saw some similarities in one of the photographs,
p289
aVbut couldn't quite make a positive identification.
p290
aVDays later, she is presented with another photo array
p291
aVof all new photographs,
p292
aVexcept that one photograph that she had some draw to
p293
aVfrom the earlier array is repeated in the second array.
p294
aVAnd a positive identification is made
p295
aVbecause the photograph replaced the memory,
p296
aVif there ever was an actual memory.
p297
aa(lp298
VPhotography offered the criminal justice system
p299
aVa tool that transformed innocent citizens into criminals,
p300
aVand the criminal justice system failed to recognize the limitations
p301
aVof relying on photographic identifications.
p302
aa(lp303
VFrederick Daye, who is photographed at his alibi location,
p304
aVwhere 13 witnesses placed him at the time of the crime.
p305
aVHe was convicted by an all-white jury
p306
aVof rape, kidnapping and vehicle theft.
p307
aVAnd he served 10 years of a life sentence.
p308
aVNow DNA exonerated Frederick
p309
aVand it also implicated another man
p310
aVwho was serving time in prison.
p311
aVBut the victim refused to press charges
p312
aVbecause she claimed that law enforcement
p313
aVhad permanently altered her memory through the use of Frederick's photograph.
p314
aa(lp315
VCharles Fain was convicted of kidnapping, rape and murder
p316
aVof a young girl walking to school.
p317
aVHe served 18 years of a death sentence.
p318
aVI photographed him at the scene of the crime
p319
aVat the Snake River in Idaho.
p320
aVAnd I photographed all of the wrongfully convicted
p321
aVat sites that came to particular significance
p322
aVin the history of their wrongful conviction.
p323
aVThe scene of arrest, the scene of misidentification,
p324
aVthe alibi location.
p325
aVAnd here, the scene of the crime, it's this place
p326
aVto which he's never been, but changed his life forever.
p327
aVSo photographing there, I was hoping to highlight
p328
aVthe tenuous relationship between truth and fiction,
p329
aVin both his life and in photography.
p330
aa(lp331
VCalvin Washington was convicted of capital murder.
p332
aVHe served 13 years of a life sentence in Waco, Texas.
p333
aa(lp334
VLarry Mayes, I photographed at the scene of arrest,
p335
aVwhere he hid between two mattresses in Gary, Indiana,
p336
aVin this very room to hide from the police.
p337
aVHe ended up serving 18 and a half years
p338
aVof an 80 year sentence for rape and robbery.
p339
aVThe victim failed to identify Larry
p340
aVin two live lineups
p341
aVand then made a positive identification, days later,
p342
aVfrom a photo array.
p343
aa(lp344
VLarry Youngblood served eight years of a 10 and half year sentence
p345
aVin Arizona for the abduction and repeated sodomizing
p346
aVof a 10 year old boy at a carnival.
p347
aVHe is photographed at his alibi location.
p348
aa(lp349
VRon Williamson. Ron was convicted of the rape and murder
p350
aVof a barmaid at a club,
p351
aVand served 11 years of a death sentence.
p352
aVI photographed Ron at a baseball field
p353
aVbecause he had been drafted to the Oakland A's
p354
aVto play professional baseball just before his conviction.
p355
aVAnd the state's key witness in Ron's case
p356
aVwas, in the end, the actual perpetrator.
p357
aa(lp358
VRonald Jones served eight years of a death sentence
p359
aVfor rape and murder of a 28-year-old woman.
p360
aVI photographed him at the scene of arrest in Chicago.
p361
aa(lp362
VWilliam Gregory was convicted of rape and burglary.
p363
aVHe served seven years of a 70 year sentence in Kentucky.
p364
aa(lp365
VTimothy Durham, who I photographed at his alibi location
p366
aVwhere 11 witnesses placed him at the time of the crime,
p367
aVwas convicted of 3.5 years
p368
aVof a 3220 year sentence,
p369
aVfor several charges of rape and robbery.
p370
aVHe had been misidentified by an 11-year-old victim.
p371
aa(lp372
VTroy Webb is photographed here at the scene of the crime in Virginia.
p373
aVHe was convicted of rape, kidnapping and robbery,
p374
aVand served seven years of a 47 year sentence.
p375
aVTroy's picture was in a photo array
p376
aVthat the victim tentatively had some draw toward,
p377
aVbut said he looked too old.
p378
aVThe police went and found a photograph of Troy Webb
p379
aVfrom four years earlier,
p380
aVwhich they entered into a photo array days later,
p381
aVand he was positively identified.
p382
aa(lp383
VNow I'm going to leave you with a self portrait.
p384
aVAnd it reiterates that distortion is a constant,
p385
aVand our eyes are easily deceived.
p386
aVThat's it. Thank you.
