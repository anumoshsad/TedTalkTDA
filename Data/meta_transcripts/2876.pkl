VCaitlin Quattromani: The election of 2016 felt different.
p4
aVPolitical conversations with our family and friends
p5
aVuncovered a level of polarization
p6
aVthat many of us had not previously experienced.
p7
aVPeople who we always thought were reasonable and intelligent
p8
aVseemed like strangers.
p9
aVWe said to ourselves, "How could you think that?
p10
aVI thought you were smart."
p11
aa(lp12
VLauran Arledge: Caitlin and I met in the summer of 2011,
p13
aVand we bonded around being working moms
p14
aVand trying to keep our very energetic boys busy.
p15
aVAnd we soon found out we had almost everything in common.
p16
aVFrom our love of Colorado to our love of sushi,
p17
aVthere wasn't much we didn't agree on.
p18
aVWe also discovered that we share a deep love of this country
p19
aVand feel a responsibility to be politically active.
p20
aVBut no one's perfect \u2014
p21
aa(lp22
V(Laughter)
p23
aVand I soon found out two disappointing things about Caitlin.
p24
aVFirst, she hates camping.
p25
aa(lp26
VCQ: I think camping is the worst.
p27
aa(lp28
VLA: So there would not be any joint camping trips in our future.
p29
aVThe second thing is that she's politically active all right \u2014
p30
aVas a conservative.
p31
aa(lp32
VCQ: I may hate camping, but I love politics.
p33
aVI listen to conservative talk radio just about every day,
p34
aVand I've volunteered for a few different conservative political campaigns.
p35
aa(lp36
VLA: And I'd say I'm a little to the left,
p37
aVlike all the way to the left.
p38
aa(lp39
V(Laughter)
p40
aa(lp41
VI've always been interested in politics.
p42
aVI was a political science major,
p43
aVand I worked as a community organizer and on a congressional campaign.
p44
aa(lp45
VCQ: So as Lauran and I were getting to know each other,
p46
aVit was right in the middle of that 2012 presidential campaign,
p47
aVand most of our early political conversations
p48
aVwere really just based in jokes and pranks.
p49
aVSo as an example, I would change Lauran's computer screen saver
p50
aVto a picture of Mitt Romney,
p51
aVor she would put an Obama campaign magnet on the back of my car.
p52
aa(lp53
V(Laughter)
p54
aa(lp55
VLA: Car, not minivan.
p56
aa(lp57
VCQ: But over time, those conversations grew more serious
p58
aVand really became a core of our friendship.
p59
aVAnd somewhere along the line,
p60
aVwe decided we didn't want to have any topic be off limits for discussion,
p61
aVeven if those topics pushed us way outside of our friendship comfort zone.
p62
aa(lp63
VLA: And so to most of us,
p64
aVpolitical conversations are a zero-sum game.
p65
aVThere's a winner and there's a loser.
p66
aVWe go for the attack and we spot a weakness in someone's argument.
p67
aVAnd here's the important part:
p68
aVwe tend to take every comment or opinion that's expressed
p69
aVas a personal affront to our own values and beliefs.
p70
aVBut what if changed the way we think about these conversations?
p71
aVWhat if, in these heated moments,
p72
aVwe chose dialogue over debate?
p73
aVWhen we engage in dialogue, we flip the script.
p74
aVWe replace our ego and our desire to win
p75
aVwith curiosity, empathy
p76
aVand a desire to learn.
p77
aVInstead of coming from a place of judgment,
p78
aVwe are genuinely interested in the other person's experiences,
p79
aVtheir values and their concerns.
p80
aa(lp81
VCQ: You make it sound so simple, Lauran.
p82
aVBut getting to that place of true dialogue is hard,
p83
aVespecially when we're talking about politics.
p84
aVIt is so easy to get emotionally fired up
p85
aVabout issues that we're passionate about,
p86
aVand we can let our ego get in the way of truly hearing
p87
aVthe other person's perspective.
p88
aVAnd in this crazy political climate we're in right now,
p89
aVunfortunately, we're seeing an extreme result
p90
aVof those heated political conversations,
p91
aVto the point where people are willing to walk away from their relationships.
p92
aVIn fact, Rasmussen released a poll earlier this year
p93
aVthat said 40 percent of people reported that the 2016 election
p94
aVnegatively impacted a personal relationship,
p95
aVand the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience tells us
p96
aVthat people tend to feel their way to their beliefs
p97
aVrather than using reasoning,
p98
aVand that when reason and emotion collide,
p99
aVit's emotion that invariably wins.
p100
aVSo no wonder it's hard to talk about these issues.
p101
aa(lp102
VLA: And look, we're just two regular friends
p103
aVwho happen to think very differently
p104
aVabout politics and the role that government should play in our lives.
p105
aVAnd I know we were all taught not to talk about politics
p106
aVbecause it's not polite,
p107
aVbut we need to be able to talk about it,
p108
aVbecause it's important to us and it's a part of who we are.
p109
aa(lp110
VCQ: We have chosen to avoid political debate
p111
aVand instead engage in dialogue
p112
aVin order to maintain what we fondly call
p113
aVour bipartisan friendship.
p114
aa(lp115
V(Laughter)
p116
aa(lp117
VLA: And this election and all of the craziness that has followed
p118
aVhas given us several opportunities to practice this skill.
p119
aa(lp120
V(Laughter)
p121
aa(lp122
VLet's start with January and the Women's March.
p123
aVAt this point, you can probably guess which one of us participated.
p124
aa(lp125
V(Laughter)
p126
aa(lp127
VCQ: Oh, the Women's March.
p128
aVI was annoyed and irritated that entire day,
p129
aVreally because of two things.
p130
aVNumber one, the name "Women's March."
p131
aVAs a conservative woman,
p132
aVthe march's platform of issues didn't represent me,
p133
aVand that's OK,
p134
aVbut hearing it talked about as this demonstration of sisterhood
p135
aVand solidarity for all women
p136
aVdidn't ring true for me.
p137
aVThe other piece was the timing of the event,
p138
aVthe fact that it was the day after the presidential inauguration.
p139
aVIt felt like we weren't even giving the new administration
p140
aVto actually do anything, good or bad,
p141
aVbefore people felt the need to demonstrate against it.
p142
aa(lp143
VLA: And under normal circumstances, I would agree with Caitlin.
p144
aVI think an administration does deserve the benefit of the doubt.
p145
aVBut in this case, I was marching to show my concern
p146
aVthat a man with such a poor track record with women and other groups
p147
aVhad been elected as president.
p148
aVI had to be part of the collective voice
p149
aVthat wanted to send a clear message to the new president
p150
aVthat we did not accept or condone
p151
aVhis behavior or rhetoric during the election.
p152
aa(lp153
VCQ: So I'm already feeling kind of aggravated,
p154
aVand then I see this Facebook from Lauran pop up in my social media feed.
p155
aa(lp156
V(Laughter)
p157
aa(lp158
VSeeing Lauran's sons at the march and holding signs
p159
aVtook it to a new level for me, and not in a good way,
p160
aVbecause I know these boys,
p161
aVI love these boys,
p162
aVand I didn't feel they were old enough
p163
aVto understand what the march stood for.
p164
aVI didn't understand why Lauran would choose
p165
aVto have them participate in that way,
p166
aVand I assumed it wasn't a choice that the boys made for themselves.
p167
aVBut I also know Lauran.
p168
aVYou're an incredible mom
p169
aVwho would never exploit your boys in any way,
p170
aVso I had to stop and check myself.
p171
aVI had a decision to make.
p172
aVI could take the easy way out
p173
aVand just choose not to say anything to her,
p174
aVand instead just kind of simmer in my frustration,
p175
aVor I could ask her to learn more about her motivations.
p176
aa(lp177
VLA: And I shared with Caitlin
p178
aVthat we actually started talking about the March
p179
aVweeks before we participated.
p180
aVAnd my boys were curious as to why the event was being organized,
p181
aVand this led to some very interesting family conversations.
p182
aVWe talked about how in this country, we have the right and the privilege
p183
aVto demonstrate against something we don't agree with,
p184
aVand my husband shared with them why he thought it was so important
p185
aVthat men joined the Women's March.
p186
aVBut the most significant reason we marched as a family
p187
aVis that it was a way for us to honor my parents' legacy.
p188
aVThey spent their careers
p189
aVworking to defend the rights of some of our most vulnerable citizens,
p190
aVand they passed these values down to me and my brother,
p191
aVand we want to do the same with our sons.
p192
aa(lp193
VCQ: After talking to Lauran,
p194
aVI really understood not only why she felt it was so important to march,
p195
aVbut why she had her boys with her.
p196
aVAnd frankly, my assumptions were wrong.
p197
aVIt was the boys who wanted to march
p198
aVafter they talked about the issues as a family.
p199
aa(lp200
VBut what's most important about this example
p201
aVis to think about the alternative.
p202
aVHad Lauran and I not talked about it,
p203
aVI would have been annoyed with her,
p204
aVand it could have resulted in an undercurrent of disrespect
p205
aVin our friendship.
p206
aVBut by asking Lauran questions, it allowed us to use dialogue
p207
aVto get to a place of true understanding.
p208
aVNow, to be clear,
p209
aVour conversation didn't really change my mind about how I felt about the March,
p210
aVbut it absolutely changed my thinking around why she brought her boys with her.
p211
aVAnd for both of us, that dialogue allowed us to understand
p212
aVeach other's perspective about the Women's March
p213
aVeven though we disagreed.
p214
aa(lp215
VLA: The second topic that challenged our ability to engage in dialogue
p216
aVwas around my need to understand
p217
aVhow Caitlin could vote for Trump.
p218
aa(lp219
V(Laughter)
p220
aa(lp221
VCaitlin is a successful professional woman
p222
aVwho is deeply caring and compassionate,
p223
aVand the Caitlin I know
p224
aVwould never excuse any man from talking about women
p225
aVthe way that Trump did during the campaign.
p226
aVIt was hard for me to reconcile these two things in my mind.
p227
aVHow could you overlook the things that were said?
p228
aa(lp229
VCQ: So I'm guessing I may not be the only one here that thought
p230
aVwe didn't have the best choices for the presidential election last year.
p231
aa(lp232
V(Laughter)
p233
aa(lp234
VThe Republican candidate who I did support didn't make it out of the primary,
p235
aVso when it came time to vote, I had a decision to make.
p236
aVAnd you're right, there were some terrible things
p237
aVthat came out during the Trump campaign,
p238
aVso much so that I almost decided to just abstain
p239
aVrather than voting for president,
p240
aVsomething I had never even considered doing before.
p241
aVBut ultimately, I did vote for Donald Trump,
p242
aVand for me it was really a vote for party over person,
p243
aVespecially recognizing how important that presidential pick is
p244
aVon influencing our judicial branch.
p245
aVBut I shared with Lauran it was a decision I really wrestled with,
p246
aVand not one that I made lightly.
p247
aa(lp248
VLA: And so after our conversation, I was struck by a few things.
p249
aVFirst, I had fallen victim to my own confirmation bias.
p250
aVBecause of my strong feelings about Trump,
p251
aVI had given all Trump voters the same attributes,
p252
aVand none of them forgiving.
p253
aa(lp254
V(Laughter)
p255
aVBut knowing Caitlin, I started to ask questions.
p256
aVWhat were Trump voters really concerned about?
p257
aVUnder all the divisive language, what was really going on?
p258
aVWhat could we learn about ourselves and our country
p259
aVfrom this unlikely event?
p260
aVI also learned that we shared a deep disappointment in this election,
p261
aVand that we have growing concerns about our two-party political system.
p262
aa(lp263
VBut the most important thing about this conversation
p264
aVis that it happened at all.
p265
aVWithout an open and honest dialogue between the two of us,
p266
aVthis election would have been the elephant in the room
p267
aVfor the next four years, pun intended.
p268
aa(lp269
V(Laughter)
p270
aa(lp271
VCQ: So, look \u2014
p272
aa(lp273
V(Applause)
p274
aa(lp275
VSo, look \u2014 we know it takes work to get past the difficult,
p276
aVfrustrating and sometimes emotional parts
p277
aVof having discussions about issues like the Women's March
p278
aVor why your friend may have voted for a candidate that you can't stand.
p279
aVBut we need to have these conversations.
p280
aVOur ability to move past political debate
p281
aVinto true dialogue
p282
aVis a critical skill we should all be focused on right now,
p283
aVespecially with the people that we care about the most.
p284
aa(lp285
VLA: And it's not just as adults that we need to bottle this behavior.
p286
aVIt's critical that we do it for our children as well.
p287
aVMy sons were inundated with this election.
p288
aVWe were listening to the news in the morning,
p289
aVand they were having conversations with their friends at school.
p290
aVI was concerned that they were picking up so much polarizing misinformation,
p291
aVand they were growing really fearful of a Trump presidency.
p292
aVThen one day, after the election, I was taking my sons to school,
p293
aVand my younger son, completely out of the blue,
p294
aVsaid, "Mom, we don't know anybody who voted for Trump, right?"
p295
aa(lp296
V(Laughter)
p297
aa(lp298
VAnd I paused and I took a deep breath.
p299
aV"Yes, we do."
p300
aa(lp301
V(Laughter)
p302
aa(lp303
V"The Quattromanis."
p304
aVAnd his response was so great.
p305
aVHe kind of got this confused look on his face, and he said ...
p306
aV"But we love them."
p307
aa(lp308
V(Laughter)
p309
aa(lp310
VAnd I answered, "Yes, we do."
p311
aa(lp312
V(Laughter)
p313
aa(lp314
VAnd then he said, "Why would they vote for him?"
p315
aVAnd I remember stopping and thinking
p316
aVthat it was really important how I answered this question.
p317
aVSomehow, I had to honor our own family values
p318
aVand show respect for our friends.
p319
aVSo I finally said,
p320
aV"They think that's the right direction for this country."
p321
aVAnd before I had even gotten the whole sentence out,
p322
aVhe had moved on to the soccer game he was going to play at recess.
p323
aa(lp324
VCQ: So life with boys.
p325
aa(lp326
V(Laughter)
p327
aa(lp328
VSo what Lauran and I have discovered through our bipartisan friendship
p329
aVis the possibility that lives in dialogue.
p330
aVWe have chosen to be genuinely curious
p331
aVabout each other's ideas and perspectives
p332
aVand to be willing to listen to one another even when we disagree.
p333
aVAnd by putting aside our ego and our preconceived ideas,
p334
aVwe've opened ourselves up to limitless learning.
p335
aVAnd perhaps most importantly for our relationship,
p336
aVwe have made the commitment to each other
p337
aVthat our friendship is way more important
p338
aVthan either of us being right or winning a conversation about politics.
p339
aVSo today, we're asking you to have a conversation.
p340
aVTalk to someone outside of your political party
p341
aVwho might challenge your thinking.
p342
aVMake an effort to engage with someone
p343
aVwith whom you might typically avoid a political conversation.
p344
aVBut remember, the goal isn't to win,
p345
aVthe goal is to listen and to understand
p346
aVand to be open to learning something new.
p347
aa(lp348
VLA: So let's go back to election night.
p349
aVAs the polls were closing
p350
aVand it became clear that Trump was going to be our new president,
p351
aVI was devastated.
p352
aVI was sad, I was confused,
p353
aVand I'll be honest \u2014 I was angry.
p354
aVAnd then just before midnight,
p355
aVI received this text message from Caitlin.
p356
aa(lp357
V[I know this is a hard night for you guys.
p358
aVWe are thinking of you. Love you.]
p359
aa(lp360
VAnd where there so easy could have been weeks or months of awkwardness
p361
aVand unspoken hostility, there was this \u2014
p362
aVan offering of empathy rooted in friendship.
p363
aVAnd I knew, in that moment, that we would make it through this.
p364
aa(lp365
VCQ: So we must find a way to engage in meaningful conversations
p366
aVthat are going to move us forward as a nation,
p367
aVand we can no longer wait
p368
aVfor our elected officials to elevate our national discourse.
p369
aa(lp370
VLA: The challenges ahead are going to require all of us
p371
aVto participate in a deeper and more meaningful way ...
p372
aVand it starts with each one of us
p373
aVbuilding connection through dialogue \u2014
p374
aVin our relationships, our communities
p375
aVand as a country.
p376
aa(lp377
VThank you.
