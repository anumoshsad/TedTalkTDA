VThe language I'm speaking right now
p4
aVis on its way to becoming the world's universal language,
p5
aVfor better or for worse.
p6
aVLet's face it,
p7
aVit's the language of the internet,
p8
aVit's the language of finance,
p9
aVit's the language of air traffic control,
p10
aVof popular music,
p11
aVdiplomacy \u2014
p12
aVEnglish is everywhere.
p13
aa(lp14
VNow, Mandarin Chinese is spoken by more people,
p15
aVbut more Chinese people are learning English
p16
aVthan English speakers are learning Chinese.
p17
aVLast I heard,
p18
aVthere are two dozen universities in China right now
p19
aVteaching all in English.
p20
aVEnglish is taking over.
p21
aa(lp22
VAnd in addition to that,
p23
aVit's been predicted that at the end of the century
p24
aValmost all of the languages that exist now \u2014
p25
aVthere are about 6,000 \u2014
p26
aVwill no longer be spoken.
p27
aVThere will only be some hundreds left.
p28
aVAnd on top of that,
p29
aVit's at the point where instant translation of live speech
p30
aVis not only possible, but it gets better every year.
p31
aa(lp32
VThe reason I'm reciting those things to you
p33
aVis because I can tell that we're getting to the point
p34
aVwhere a question is going to start being asked,
p35
aVwhich is: Why should we learn foreign languages \u2014
p36
aVother than if English happens to be foreign to one?
p37
aVWhy bother to learn another one when it's getting to the point
p38
aVwhere almost everybody in the world will be able to communicate in one?
p39
aa(lp40
VI think there are a lot of reasons,
p41
aVbut I first want to address
p42
aVthe one that you're probably most likely to have heard of,
p43
aVbecause actually it's more dangerous than you might think.
p44
aVAnd that is the idea
p45
aVthat a language channels your thoughts,
p46
aVthat the vocabulary and the grammar of different languages
p47
aVgives everybody a different kind of acid trip,
p48
aVso to speak.
p49
aVThat is a marvelously enticing idea,
p50
aVbut it's kind of fraught.
p51
aa(lp52
VSo it's not that it's untrue completely.
p53
aVSo for example, in French and Spanish
p54
aVthe word for table is, for some reason, marked as feminine.
p55
aVSo, "la table," "la mesa," you just have to deal with it.
p56
aVIt has been shown
p57
aVthat if you are a speaker of one of those languages
p58
aVand you happen to be asked
p59
aVhow you would imagine a table talking,
p60
aVthen much more often than could possibly be an accident,
p61
aVa French or a Spanish speaker
p62
aVsays that the table would talk with a high and feminine voice.
p63
aVSo if you're French or Spanish, to you, a table is kind of a girl,
p64
aVas opposed to if you are an English speaker.
p65
aa(lp66
VIt's hard not to love data like that,
p67
aVand many people will tell you that that means
p68
aVthat there's a worldview that you have if you speak one of those languages.
p69
aVBut you have to watch out,
p70
aVbecause imagine if somebody put us under the microscope,
p71
aVthe us being those of us who speak English natively.
p72
aVWhat is the worldview from English?
p73
aa(lp74
VSo for example, let's take an English speaker.
p75
aVUp on the screen, that is Bono.
p76
aVHe speaks English.
p77
aVI presume he has a worldview.
p78
aVNow, that is Donald Trump.
p79
aVIn his way,
p80
aVhe speaks English as well.
p81
aa(lp82
V(Laughter)
p83
aa(lp84
VAnd here is Ms. Kardashian,
p85
aVand she is an English speaker, too.
p86
aVSo here are three speakers of the English language.
p87
aVWhat worldview do those three people have in common?
p88
aVWhat worldview is shaped through the English language that unites them?
p89
aVIt's a highly fraught concept.
p90
aVAnd so gradual consensus is becoming that language can shape thought,
p91
aVbut it tends to be in rather darling, obscure psychological flutters.
p92
aVIt's not a matter of giving you a different pair of glasses on the world.
p93
aa(lp94
VNow, if that's the case,
p95
aVthen why learn languages?
p96
aVIf it isn't going to change the way you think,
p97
aVwhat would the other reasons be?
p98
aVThere are some.
p99
aVOne of them is that if you want to imbibe a culture,
p100
aVif you want to drink it in, if you want to become part of it,
p101
aVthen whether or not the language channels the culture \u2014
p102
aVand that seems doubtful \u2014
p103
aVif you want to imbibe the culture,
p104
aVyou have to control to some degree
p105
aVthe language that the culture happens to be conducted in.
p106
aVThere's no other way.
p107
aa(lp108
VThere's an interesting illustration of this.
p109
aVI have to go slightly obscure, but really you should seek it out.
p110
aVThere's a movie by the Canadian film director Denys Arcand \u2014
p111
aVread out in English on the page, "Dennis Ar-cand,"
p112
aVif you want to look him up.
p113
aVHe did a film called "Jesus of Montreal."
p114
aVAnd many of the characters
p115
aVare vibrant, funny, passionate, interesting French-Canadian,
p116
aVFrench-speaking women.
p117
aVThere's one scene closest to the end,
p118
aVwhere they have to take a friend to an Anglophone hospital.
p119
aVIn the hospital, they have to speak English.
p120
aVNow, they speak English but it's not their native language,
p121
aVthey'd rather not speak English.
p122
aVAnd they speak it more slowly,
p123
aVthey have accents, they're not idiomatic.
p124
aVSuddenly these characters that you've fallen in love with
p125
aVbecome husks of themselves, they're shadows of themselves.
p126
aa(lp127
VTo go into a culture
p128
aVand to only ever process people through that kind of skrim curtain
p129
aVis to never truly get the culture.
p130
aVAnd so to the extent that hundreds of languages will be left,
p131
aVone reason to learn them
p132
aVis because they are tickets to being able to participate
p133
aVin the culture of the people who speak them,
p134
aVjust by virtue of the fact that it is their code.
p135
aVSo that's one reason.
p136
aa(lp137
VSecond reason:
p138
aVit's been shown
p139
aVthat if you speak two languages, dementia is less likely to set in,
p140
aVand that you are probably a better multitasker.
p141
aVAnd these are factors that set in early,
p142
aVand so that ought to give you some sense
p143
aVof when to give junior or juniorette lessons in another language.
p144
aVBilingualism is healthy.
p145
aa(lp146
VAnd then, third \u2014
p147
aVlanguages are just an awful lot of fun.
p148
aVMuch more fun than we're often told.
p149
aVSo for example, Arabic: "kataba," he wrote,
p150
aV"yaktubu," he writes, she writes.
p151
aV"Uktub," write, in the imperative.
p152
aVWhat do those things have in common?
p153
aVAll those things have in common
p154
aVthe consonants sitting in the middle like pillars.
p155
aVThey stay still,
p156
aVand the vowels dance around the consonants.
p157
aVWho wouldn't want to roll that around in their mouths?
p158
aVYou can get that from Hebrew,
p159
aVyou can get that from Ethiopia's main language, Amharic.
p160
aVThat's fun.
p161
aa(lp162
VOr languages have different word orders.
p163
aVLearning how to speak with different word order
p164
aVis like driving on the different side of a street if you go to certain country,
p165
aVor the feeling that you get when you put Witch Hazel around your eyes
p166
aVand you feel the tingle.
p167
aVA language can do that to you.
p168
aa(lp169
VSo for example,
p170
aV"The Cat in the Hat Comes Back,"
p171
aVa book that I'm sure we all often return to,
p172
aVlike "Moby Dick."
p173
aVOne phrase in it is, "Do you know where I found him?
p174
aVDo you know where he was? He was eating cake in the tub,
p175
aVYes he was!"
p176
aVFine. Now, if you learn that in Mandarin Chinese,
p177
aVthen you have to master,
p178
aV"You can know, I did where him find?
p179
aVHe was tub inside gorging cake,
p180
aVNo mistake gorging chewing!"
p181
aVThat just feels good.
p182
aVImagine being able to do that for years and years at a time.
p183
aa(lp184
VOr, have you ever learned any Cambodian?
p185
aVMe either, but if I did,
p186
aVI would get to roll around in my mouth not some baker's dozen of vowels
p187
aVlike English has,
p188
aVbut a good 30 different vowels
p189
aVscooching and oozing around in the Cambodian mouth
p190
aVlike bees in a hive.
p191
aVThat is what a language can get you.
p192
aa(lp193
VAnd more to the point,
p194
aVwe live in an era when it's never been easier to teach yourself another language.
p195
aVIt used to be that you had to go to a classroom,
p196
aVand there would be some diligent teacher \u2014
p197
aVsome genius teacher in there \u2014
p198
aVbut that person was only in there at certain times
p199
aVand you had to go then,
p200
aVand then was not most times.
p201
aVYou had to go to class.
p202
aVIf you didn't have that, you had something called a record.
p203
aVI cut my teeth on those.
p204
aVThere was only so much data on a record,
p205
aVor a cassette,
p206
aVor even that antique object known as a CD.
p207
aVOther than that you had books that didn't work,
p208
aVthat's just the way it was.
p209
aa(lp210
VToday you can lay down \u2014
p211
aVlie on your living room floor,
p212
aVsipping bourbon,
p213
aVand teach yourself any language that you want to
p214
aVwith wonderful sets such as Rosetta Stone.
p215
aVI highly recommend the lesser known Glossika as well.
p216
aVYou can do it any time,
p217
aVtherefore you can do it more and better.
p218
aVYou can give yourself your morning pleasures in various languages.
p219
aVI take some "Dilbert" in various languages every single morning;
p220
aVit can increase your skills.
p221
aVCouldn't have done it 20 years ago
p222
aVwhen the idea of having any language you wanted
p223
aVin your pocket,
p224
aVcoming from your phone,
p225
aVwould have sounded like science fiction to very sophisticated people.
p226
aa(lp227
VSo I highly recommend
p228
aVthat you teach yourself languages other than the one that I'm speaking,
p229
aVbecause there's never been a better time to do it.
p230
aVIt's an awful lot of fun.
p231
aVIt won't change your mind,
p232
aVbut it will most certainly blow your mind.
p233
aa(lp234
VThank you very much.
