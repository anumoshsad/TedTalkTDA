VSo, can we dare to be optimistic?
p4
aVWell, the thesis of "The Bottom Billion"
p5
aVis that a billion people have been stuck living
p6
aVin economies that have been stagnant for 40 years,
p7
aVand hence diverging from the rest of mankind.
p8
aVAnd so, the real question to pose is not, "Can we be optimistic?"
p9
aVIt's, "How can we give credible hope to that billion people?"
p10
aVThat, to my mind, is the fundamental challenge now of development.
p11
aa(lp12
VWhat I'm going to offer you is a recipe,
p13
aVa combination of the two forces that changed the world for good,
p14
aVwhich is the alliance of compassion and enlightened self-interest.
p15
aVCompassion, because a billion people are living in societies
p16
aVthat have not offered credible hope.
p17
aVThat is a human tragedy.
p18
aVEnlightened self-interest, because if that economic divergence
p19
aVcontinues for another 40 years,
p20
aVcombined with social integration globally,
p21
aVit will build a nightmare for our children.
p22
aVWe need compassion to get ourselves started,
p23
aVand enlightened self-interest to get ourselves serious.
p24
aVThat's the alliance that changes the world.
p25
aa(lp26
VSo, what does it mean to get serious about providing hope for the bottom billion?
p27
aVWhat can we actually do?
p28
aVWell, a good guide is to think,
p29
aV"What did we do last time the rich world got serious
p30
aVabout developing another region of the world?"
p31
aVThat gives us, it turns out, quite a good clue,
p32
aVexcept you have to go back quite a long time.
p33
aVThe last time the rich world got serious
p34
aVabout developing another region was in the late 1940s.
p35
aVThe rich world was you, America,
p36
aVand the region that needed to be developed was my world, Europe.
p37
aVThat was post-War Europe.
p38
aa(lp39
VWhy did America get serious?
p40
aVIt wasn't just compassion for Europe, though there was that.
p41
aVIt was that you knew you had to,
p42
aVbecause, in the late 1940s, country after country in Central Europe
p43
aVwas falling into the Soviet bloc, and so you knew you'd no choice.
p44
aVEurope had to be dragged into economic development.
p45
aa(lp46
VSo, what did you do, last time you got serious?
p47
aVWell, yes, you had a big aid program. Thank you very much.
p48
aVThat was Marshall aid: we need to do it again. Aid is part of the solution.
p49
aVBut what else did you do?
p50
aVWell, you tore up your trade policy, and totally reversed it.
p51
aVBefore the war, America had been highly protectionist.
p52
aVAfter the war, you opened your markets to Europe,
p53
aVyou dragged Europe into the then-global economy, which was your economy,
p54
aVand you institutionalized that trade liberalization
p55
aVthrough founding the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
p56
aVSo, total reversal of trade policy.
p57
aa(lp58
VDid you do anything else?
p59
aVYes, you totally reversed your security policy.
p60
aVBefore the war, your security policy had been isolationist.
p61
aVAfter the war, you tear that up, you put 100,000 troops in Europe
p62
aVfor over 40 years.
p63
aVSo, total reversal of security policy. Anything else?
p64
aVYes, you tear up the "Eleventh Commandment" \u2014
p65
aVnational sovereignty.
p66
aVBefore the war, you treated national sovereignty as so sacrosanct
p67
aVthat you weren't even willing to join the League of Nations.
p68
aVAfter the war, you found the United Nations,
p69
aVyou found the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,
p70
aVyou found the IMF, you encouraged Europe to create the European Community \u2014
p71
aVall systems for mutual government support.
p72
aVThat is still the waterfront of effective policies:
p73
aVaid, trade, security, governments.
p74
aVOf course, the details of policy are going to be different,
p75
aVbecause the challenge is different.
p76
aVIt's not rebuilding Europe, it's reversing the divergence
p77
aVfor the bottom billion, so that they actually catch up.
p78
aVIs that easier or harder?
p79
aVWe need to be at least as serious as we were then.
p80
aa(lp81
VNow, today I'm going to take just one of those four.
p82
aVI'm going to take the one that sounds the weakest,
p83
aVthe one that's just motherhood and apple pie \u2014
p84
aVgovernments, mutual systems of support for governments \u2014
p85
aVand I'm going to show you one idea
p86
aVin how we could do something to strengthen governance,
p87
aVand I'm going to show you that that is enormously important now.
p88
aVThe opportunity we're going to look to
p89
aVis a genuine basis for optimism about the bottom billion,
p90
aVand that is the commodity booms.
p91
aVThe commodity booms are pumping unprecedented amounts of money
p92
aVinto many, though not all, of the countries of the bottom billion.
p93
aVPartly, they're pumping money in because commodity prices are high,
p94
aVbut it's not just that. There's also a range of new discoveries.
p95
aVUganda has just discovered oil, in about the most disastrous location on Earth;
p96
aVGhana has discovered oil;
p97
aVGuinea has got a huge new exploitation of iron ore coming out of the ground.
p98
aVSo, a mass of new discoveries.
p99
aVBetween them, these new revenue flows dwarf aid.
p100
aVJust to give you one example:
p101
aVAngola alone is getting 50 billion dollars a year in oil revenue.
p102
aVThe entire aid flows to the 60 countries of the bottom billion last year were 34 billion.
p103
aVSo, the flow of resources from the commodity booms
p104
aVto the bottom billion are without precedent.
p105
aVSo there's the optimism.
p106
aa(lp107
VThe question is, how is it going to help their development?
p108
aVIt's a huge opportunity for transformational development.
p109
aVWill it be taken?
p110
aVSo, here comes a bit of science, and this is a bit of science I've done
p111
aVsince "The Bottom Billion," so it's new.
p112
aVI've looked to see what is the relationship between
p113
aVhigher commodity prices of exports,
p114
aVand the growth of commodity-exporting countries.
p115
aVAnd I've looked globally, I've taken all the countries in the world
p116
aVfor the last 40 years,
p117
aVand looked to see what the relationship is.
p118
aVAnd the short run \u2014 say, the first five to seven years \u2014 is just great.
p119
aVIn fact, it's hunky dory: everything goes up.
p120
aVYou get more money because your terms of trade have improved,
p121
aVbut also that drives up output across the board.
p122
aVSo GDP goes up a lot \u2014 fantastic! That's the short run.
p123
aVAnd how about the long run?
p124
aVCome back 15 years later.
p125
aVWell, the short run, it's hunky dory,
p126
aVbut the long run, it's humpty dumpty.
p127
aVYou go up in the short run, but then most societies
p128
aVhistorically have ended up worse than if they'd had no booms at all.
p129
aVThat is not a forecast about how commodity prices go;
p130
aVit's a forecast of the consequences, the long-term consequences,
p131
aVfor growth of an increase in prices.
p132
aa(lp133
VSo, what goes wrong? Why is there this "resource curse," as it's called?
p134
aVAnd again, I've looked at that, and it turns out
p135
aVthat the critical issue is the level of governance,
p136
aVthe initial level of economic governance,
p137
aVwhen the resource booms accrue.
p138
aVIn fact, if you've got good enough governance,
p139
aVthere is no resource boom.
p140
aVYou go up in the short term, and then you go up even more in the long term.
p141
aVThat's Norway, the richest country in Europe. It's Australia. It's Canada.
p142
aVThe resource curse is entirely confined to countries
p143
aVbelow a threshold of governance.
p144
aVThey still go up in the short run.
p145
aVThat's what we're seeing across the bottom billion at the moment.
p146
aVThe best growth rates they've had \u2014 ever.
p147
aVAnd the question is whether the short run will persist.
p148
aVAnd with bad governance historically, over the last 40 years, it hasn't.
p149
aVIt's countries like Nigeria, which are worse off than if they'd never had oil.
p150
aa(lp151
VSo, there's a threshold level above which you go up in the long term,
p152
aVand below which you go down.
p153
aVJust to benchmark that threshold,
p154
aVit's about the governance level of Portugal in the mid 1980s.
p155
aVSo, the question is, are the bottom billion above or below that threshold?
p156
aVNow, there's one big change since the commodity booms of the 1970s,
p157
aVand that is the spread of democracy.
p158
aVSo I thought, well, maybe that is the thing
p159
aVwhich has transformed governance in the bottom billion.
p160
aVMaybe we can be more optimistic because of the spread of democracy.
p161
aVSo, I looked. Democracy does have significant effects \u2014
p162
aVand unfortunately, they're adverse.
p163
aVDemocracies make even more of a mess of these resource booms than autocracies.
p164
aa(lp165
VAt that stage I just wanted to abandon the research, but \u2014
p166
aV(Laughter)
p167
aV\u2014 it turns out that democracy is a little bit more complicated than that.
p168
aVBecause there are two distinct aspects of democracy:
p169
aVthere's electoral competition, which determines how you acquire power,
p170
aVand there are checks and balances, which determine how you use power.
p171
aVIt turns out that electoral competition is the thing
p172
aVthat's doing the damage with democracy,
p173
aVwhereas strong checks and balances make resource booms good.
p174
aVAnd so, what the countries of the bottom billion need
p175
aVis very strong checks and balances.
p176
aVThey haven't got them.
p177
aVThey got instant democracy in the 1990s:
p178
aVelections without checks and balances.
p179
aa(lp180
VHow can we help improve governance and introduce checks and balances?
p181
aVIn all the societies of the bottom billion,
p182
aVthere are intense struggles to do just that.
p183
aVThe simple proposal is that we should have some international standards,
p184
aVwhich will be voluntary, but which would spell out the key decision points
p185
aVthat need to be taken in order
p186
aVto harness these resource revenues.
p187
aVWe know these international standards work
p188
aVbecause we've already got one.
p189
aVIt's called the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.
p190
aVThat is the very simple idea that governments should report
p191
aVto their citizens what revenues they have.
p192
aVNo sooner was it proposed
p193
aVthan reformers in Nigeria adopted it, pushed it and published the revenues in the paper.
p194
aVNigerian newspapers circulations spiked.
p195
aVPeople wanted to know what their government was getting
p196
aVin terms of revenue.
p197
aa(lp198
VSo, we know it works. What would the content be of these international standards?
p199
aVI can't go through all of them, but I'll give you an example.
p200
aVThe first is how to take the resources out of the ground \u2014
p201
aVthe economic processes, taking the resources out of the ground
p202
aVand putting assets on top of the ground.
p203
aVAnd the first step in that is selling the rights to resource extraction.
p204
aVYou know how rights to resource extraction are being sold at the moment,
p205
aVhow they've been sold over the last 40 years?
p206
aVA company flies in, does a deal with a minister.
p207
aVAnd that's great for the company,
p208
aVand it's quite often great for the minister \u2014
p209
aV(Laughter)
p210
aV\u2014 and it's not great for their country.
p211
aVThere's a very simple institutional technology
p212
aVwhich can transform that,
p213
aVand it's called verified auctions.
p214
aVThe public agency with the greatest expertise on Earth
p215
aVis of course the treasury \u2014 that is, the British Treasury.
p216
aVAnd the British Treasury decided that it would sell the rights
p217
aVto third-generation mobile phones
p218
aVby working out what those rights were worth.
p219
aVThey worked out they were worth two billion pounds.
p220
aVJust in time, a set of economists got there and said,
p221
aV"Why not try an auction? It'll reveal the value."
p222
aVIt went for 20 billion pounds through auction.
p223
aVIf the British Treasury can be out by a factor of 10,
p224
aVthink what the ministry of finance in Sierra Leone is going to be like.
p225
aV(Laughter)
p226
aVWhen I put that to the President of Sierra Leone,
p227
aVthe next day he asked the World Bank to send him a team
p228
aVto give expertise on how to conduct auctions.
p229
aa(lp230
VThere are five such decision points;
p231
aVeach one needs an international standard.
p232
aVIf we could do it, we would change the world.
p233
aVWe would be helping the reformers in these societies,
p234
aVwho are struggling for change.
p235
aVThat's our modest role. We cannot change these societies,
p236
aVbut we can help the people in these societies
p237
aVwho are struggling and usually failing,
p238
aVbecause the odds are so stacked against them.
p239
aVAnd yet, we've not got these rules.
p240
aVIf you think about it, the cost of promulgating international rules
p241
aVis zilch \u2014 nothing.
p242
aVWhy on Earth are they not there?
p243
aVI realized that the reason they're not there
p244
aVis that until we have a critical mass of informed citizens in our own societies,
p245
aVpoliticians will get away with gestures.
p246
aVThat unless we have an informed society,
p247
aVwhat politicians do, especially in relation to Africa, is gestures:
p248
aVthings that look good, but don't work.
p249
aVAnd so I realized we had to go through the business
p250
aVof building an informed citizenry.
p251
aa(lp252
VThat's why I broke all the professional rules of conduct for an economist,
p253
aVand I wrote an economics book that you could read on a beach.
p254
aV(Laughter).
p255
aVHowever, I have to say, the process of communication
p256
aVdoes not come naturally to me.
p257
aVThis is why I'm on this stage, but it's alarming.
p258
aVI grew up in a culture of self-effacement.
p259
aVMy wife showed me a blog comment on one of my last talks,
p260
aVand the blog comment said, "Collier is not charismatic \u2014
p261
aV(Laughter)
p262
aV\u2014 but his arguments are compelling."
p263
aV(Laughter)
p264
aV(Applause)
p265
aVIf you agree with that sentiment,
p266
aVand if you agree that we need a critical mass of informed citizenry,
p267
aVyou will realize that I need you.
p268
aVPlease, become ambassadors.
p269
aVThank you.
