VI'm going to talk about two stories today.
p4
aVOne is how we need to use market-based pricing to affect demand
p5
aVand use wireless technologies to dramatically reduce our emissions
p6
aVin the transportation sector.
p7
aVAnd the other is that there is an incredible opportunity
p8
aVif we choose the right wireless technologies;
p9
aVhow we can generate a new engine for economic growth
p10
aVand dramatically reduce C02 in the other sectors.
p11
aa(lp12
VI'm really scared.
p13
aVWe need to reduce C02 emissions in ten to fifteen years by 80 percent
p14
aVin order to avert catastrophic effects.
p15
aVAnd I am astounded that I'm standing here to tell you that.
p16
aVWhat are catastrophic effects? A three degree centigrade climate change rise
p17
aVthat will result in 50 percent species extinction.
p18
aVIt's not a movie. This is real life.
p19
aVAnd I'm really worried, because when people talk about cars
p20
aV\u2014 which I know something about \u2014
p21
aVthe press and politicians and people in this room are all thinking,
p22
aV"Let's use fuel-efficient cars."
p23
aVIf we started today, 10 years from now, at the end of this window of opportunity,
p24
aVthose fuel-efficient cars will reduce our fossil fuel needs by four percent.
p25
aVThat is not enough.
p26
aa(lp27
VBut now I'll talk about some more pleasant things.
p28
aVHere are some ways that we can make some dramatic changes.
p29
aVSo, Zipcar is a company that I founded seven years ago,
p30
aVbut it's an example of something called car sharing.
p31
aVWhat Zipcar does is we park cars throughout dense urban areas
p32
aVfor members to reserve, by the hour and by the day, instead of using their own car.
p33
aVHow does it feel to be a person using a Zipcar?
p34
aVIt means that I pay only for what I need.
p35
aVAll those hours when a car is sitting idle, I'm not paying for it.
p36
aVIt means that I can choose a car exactly for that particular trip.
p37
aVSo, here's a woman that reserved MiniMia, and she had her day.
p38
aVI can take a BMW when I'm seeing clients.
p39
aVI can drive my Toyota Element when I'm going to go on that surfing trip.
p40
aa(lp41
VAnd the other remarkable thing is it's, I think, the highest status of car ownership.
p42
aVNot only do I have a fleet of cars available to me in seven cities around the world
p43
aVthat I can have at my beck and call,
p44
aVbut heaven forbid I would ever maintain
p45
aVor deal with the repair or have anything to do with it.
p46
aVIt's like the car that you always wanted that your mom said that you couldn't have.
p47
aVI get all the good stuff and none of the bad.
p48
aa(lp49
VSo, what is the social result of this?
p50
aVThe social result is that today's Zipcar has 100,000 members
p51
aVdriving 3,000 cars parked in 3,000 parking spaces.
p52
aVInstead of driving 12,000 miles a year, which is what the average city dweller does,
p53
aVthey drive 500 miles a year. Are they happy?
p54
aVThe company has been doubling in size ever since I founded it, or greater.
p55
aVPeople adore the company. And it's better,
p56
aVyou know? They like it.
p57
aVSo, how is it that people went from the 12,000 miles a year to 500 miles?
p58
aVIt's because they said, "It's eight to 10 dollars an hour and 65 dollars a day.
p59
aVIf I'm going to go buy some ice cream,
p60
aVdo I really want to spend eight dollars to go buy the ice cream? Or maybe I'll do without.
p61
aVMaybe I would have bought the ice cream when I did some other errand."
p62
aVSo, people really respond very quickly to it, to prices.
p63
aa(lp64
VAnd the last point I want to make is Zipcar would never be possible without technology.
p65
aVIt required that it was completely trivial: that it takes 30 seconds
p66
aVto reserve a car, go get it, drive it.
p67
aVAnd for me, as a service provider,
p68
aVI would never be able to provide you a car for an hour
p69
aVif the transaction cost was anything.
p70
aVSo, without these wireless technologies, this, as a concept, could never happen.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo, here's another example. This company is GoLoco \u2014
p73
aVI'm launching it in about three weeks \u2014
p74
aVand I hope to do for ridesharing what I did for car sharing.
p75
aVThis will apply to people across all of America.
p76
aVToday, 75 percent of the trips are single-occupancy vehicles,
p77
aVyet 12 percent of trips to work are currently carpool.
p78
aVAnd I think that we can apply social networks and online payment systems
p79
aVto completely change how people feel about ridesharing
p80
aVand make that trip much more efficient.
p81
aa(lp82
VAnd so when I think about the future,
p83
aVpeople will be thinking that sharing the ride with someone
p84
aVis this incredibly great social event out of their day.
p85
aVYou know, how did you get to TED? You went with other TEDsters.
p86
aVHow fabulous. Why would you ever want to go by yourself in your own car?
p87
aVHow did you go food shopping? You went with your neighbor, what a great social time.
p88
aVYou know it's going to really transform how we feel about travel,
p89
aVand it will also, I think, enhance our freedom of mobility.
p90
aVWhere can I go today and who can I do it with?
p91
aVThose are the types of things that you will look at and feel.
p92
aa(lp93
VAnd the social benefits:
p94
aVthe rate of single-occupancy vehicles is, I told you, 75 percent;
p95
aVI think we can get that down to 50 percent.
p96
aVThe demand for parking, of course, is down, congestion and the CO2 emissions.
p97
aVOne last piece about this, of course, is that it's enabled by wireless technologies.
p98
aVAnd it's the cost of driving that's making people want to be able to do this.
p99
aVThe average American spends 19 percent of their income on their car,
p100
aVand there's a pressure for them to reduce that cost, yet they have no outlet today.
p101
aa(lp102
VSo, the last example of this is congestion pricing, very famously done in London.
p103
aVIt's when you charge a premium for people to drive on congested roads.
p104
aVIn London, the day they turned the congestion pricing on,
p105
aVthere was a 25 percent decrease in congestion overnight,
p106
aVand that's persisted for the four years in which they've been doing congestion pricing.
p107
aVAnd again, do people like the outcome?
p108
aVKen Livingstone was reelected.
p109
aVSo again, we can see that price plays an enormous role in people's willingness
p110
aVto reduce their driving behavior.
p111
aVWe've tripled the miles that we drive since 1970 and doubled them since 1982.
p112
aVThere's a huge slack in that system;
p113
aVwith the right pricing we can undo that.
p114
aa(lp115
VCongestion pricing is being discussed in every major city around the world
p116
aVand is, again, wirelessly enabled.
p117
aVYou weren't going to put tollbooths around the city of London
p118
aVand open and shut those gates.
p119
aVAnd what congestion pricing is is that it's a technology trial and a psychological trial
p120
aVfor something called road pricing.
p121
aVAnd road pricing is where we're all going to have to go,
p122
aVbecause today we pay for our maintenance
p123
aVand wear and tear on our cars with gas taxes.
p124
aVAnd as we get our cars more fuel-efficient,
p125
aVthat's going to be reducing the amount of revenue that you get off of those gas taxes,
p126
aVso we need to charge people by the mile that they drive.
p127
aVWhatever happens with congestion pricing and those technologies
p128
aVwill be happening with road pricing.
p129
aa(lp130
VWhy do we travel too much?
p131
aVCar travel is underpriced and therefore we over-consumed.
p132
aVWe need to put this better market feedback.
p133
aVAnd if we have it, you'll decide how many miles to drive,
p134
aVwhat mode of travel, where to live and work.
p135
aVAnd wireless technologies make this real-time loop possible.
p136
aa(lp137
VSo, I want to move now to the second part of my story,
p138
aVwhich is: when are we going to start doing
p139
aVthis congestion pricing? Road pricing is coming.
p140
aVWhen are we going to do it? Are we going to wait
p141
aV10 to 15 years for this to happen
p142
aVor are we going to finally have this political will to make it happen in the next two years?
p143
aVBecause I'm going to say, that is going to be the tool that's going to turn our usage overnight.
p144
aa(lp145
VAnd what kind of wireless technology are we going to use?
p146
aVThis is my big vision.
p147
aVThere is a tool that can help us bridge the digital divide,
p148
aVrespond to emergencies, get traffic moving,
p149
aVprovide a new engine for economic growth
p150
aVand dramatically reduce CO2 emissions in every sector.
p151
aVAnd this is a moment from "The Graduate." Do you remember this moment?
p152
aVYou guys are going to be the handsome young guy
p153
aVand I'm going to be the wise businessman.
p154
aV"I want to say one word to you, just one word."
p155
aV"Yes, sir?" "Are you listening?" "Yes I am."
p156
aV"Ad-hoc peer-to-peer self-configuring wireless networks."
p157
aV(Laughter)
p158
aVThese are also called mesh networks.
p159
aVAnd in a mesh, every device contributes to and expands the network,
p160
aVand I think you might have heard a little bit about it before.
p161
aa(lp162
VI'm going to give you some examples.
p163
aVYou'll be hearing later today from Alan Kay.
p164
aVThese laptops, when a child opens them up,
p165
aVthey communicate with every single child in the classroom,
p166
aVwithin that school, within that village.
p167
aVAnd what is the cost of that communication system?
p168
aVZero dollars a month.
p169
aVHere's another example: in New Orleans,
p170
aVvideo cameras were mesh-enabled
p171
aVso that they could monitor crime in the downtown French Quarter.
p172
aVWhen the hurricane happened,
p173
aVthe only communication system standing was the mesh network.
p174
aVVolunteers flew in, added a whole bunch of devices,
p175
aVand for the next 12 months,
p176
aVmesh networks were the only wireless that was happening in New Orleans.
p177
aa(lp178
VAnother example is in Portsmouth, U.K.
p179
aVThey mesh-enabled 300 buses and they speak to these smart terminals.
p180
aVYou can look at the terminal
p181
aVand be able to see precisely where your bus is on the street
p182
aVand when it's coming, and you can buy your tickets in real time.
p183
aVAgain, all mesh-enabled. Monthly communication cost: zero.
p184
aVSo, the beauty of mesh networks:
p185
aVyou can have these very low-cost devices.
p186
aVZero ongoing communication costs. Highly scalable;
p187
aVyou can just keep adding them, and as in Katrina,
p188
aVyou can keep subtracting them \u2014 as long as there's some, we can still communicate.
p189
aVThey're resilient; their redundancy is built into this fabulous decentralized design.
p190
aa(lp191
VWhat are the incredible weaknesses?
p192
aVThere isn't anybody in Washington lobbying to make it happen \u2014
p193
aVor in those municipalities, to build out their cities with these wireless networks \u2014
p194
aVbecause there's zero ongoing communications cost.
p195
aVSo, the examples that I gave you are these islands of mesh networks,
p196
aVand networks are interesting only as they are big.
p197
aa(lp198
VHow do we create a big network?
p199
aVAre you guys ready again \u2014 "The Graduate"?
p200
aVThis time you will still play the handsome young thing, but I'll be the sexy woman.
p201
aVThese are the next two lines in the movie.
p202
aV"Where did you do it?" "In his car."
p203
aVSo you know, when you stick this idea ... (Laughter)
p204
aVwhere would we expect me, Robin Chase, to be thinking
p205
aVis imagine if we put a mesh-network device
p206
aVin every single car across America.
p207
aVWe could have a coast-to-coast, free wireless communication system.
p208
aVI guess I just want you to think about that.
p209
aa(lp210
VAnd why is this going to happen? Because we're going to do congestion pricing,
p211
aVwe are going to do road tolls,
p212
aVgas taxes are going to become road pricing.
p213
aVThese things are going to happen.
p214
aVWhat's the wireless technology we're going to use?
p215
aVMaybe we should use a good one. When are we going to do it?
p216
aVMaybe we shouldn't wait for the 10 or 15 years for this to happen.
p217
aVWe should pull it forward.
p218
aa(lp219
VSo, I'd like us to launch the wireless Internet interstate wireless mesh system,
p220
aVand require that this network be accessible to everyone, with open standards.
p221
aVRight now in the transportation sector, we're creating these wireless devices \u2014
p222
aVI guess you guys might have Fast Pass here or Easy Lane \u2014
p223
aVthat are single-purpose devices in these closed networks.
p224
aVWhat is the point?
p225
aVWe're transferring just a few little data bits
p226
aVwhen we're doing road controlling, road pricing.
p227
aVWe have this incredible excess capacity.
p228
aVSo, we can provide the lowest-cost means of going wireless coast-to-coast,
p229
aVwe can have resilient nationwide communication systems,
p230
aVwe have a new tool for creating efficiencies in all sectors.
p231
aVImagine what happens when the cost of getting information
p232
aVfrom anywhere to anywhere is close to zero.
p233
aVWhat you can do with that tool: we can create an economic engine.
p234
aVInformation should be free, and access to information should be free,
p235
aVand we should be charging people for carbon.
p236
aa(lp237
VI think this is a more powerful tool than the Interstate Highway Act,
p238
aVand I think this is as important and world changing
p239
aVto our economy as electrification.
p240
aVAnd if I had my druthers,
p241
aVwe would have an open-source version in addition to open standards.
p242
aVAnd this open-source version means that
p243
aVit could be \u2014 if we did a brilliant job of it \u2014
p244
aVit could be used around the world very quickly.
p245
aVSo, going back to one of my earlier thoughts.
p246
aVImagine if every one of these buses in Lagos was part of the mesh network.
p247
aVWhen I went this morning to Larry Brilliant's TEDTalk prize
p248
aV\u2014 his fabulous networks \u2014
p249
aVimagine if there was an open-source
p250
aVmesh communications device that can be put into those networks,
p251
aVto make all that happen.
p252
aVAnd we can be doing it if we could just get over the fact that
p253
aVthis little slice of things is going to be for free.
p254
aVWe could make billions of dollars on top of it,
p255
aVbut this one particular slice of communications needs to be open source.
p256
aa(lp257
VSo, let's take control of this nightmare:
p258
aVimplement a gas tax immediately;
p259
aVtransition across the nation to road-tolling with this wireless mesh;
p260
aVrequire that the mesh be open to all, with open standards;
p261
aVand, of course, use mesh networks.
p262
aVThank you. (Applause)
