VWelcome. If I could have the first slide, please?
p4
aVContrary to calculations made by some engineers, bees can fly,
p5
aVdolphins can swim, and geckos can even climb
p6
aVup the smoothest surfaces. Now, what I want to do, in the short time I have,
p7
aVis to try to allow each of you to experience
p8
aVthe thrill of revealing nature's design.
p9
aVI get to do this all the time, and it's just incredible.
p10
aVI want to try to share just a little bit of that with you in this presentation.
p11
aVThe challenge of looking at nature's designs \u2014
p12
aVand I'll tell you the way that we perceive it, and the way we've used it.
p13
aVThe challenge, of course, is to answer this question:
p14
aVwhat permits this extraordinary performance of animals
p15
aVthat allows them basically to go anywhere?
p16
aVAnd if we could figure that out, how can we implement those designs?
p17
aa(lp18
VWell, many biologists will tell engineers, and others,
p19
aVorganisms have millions of years to get it right;
p20
aVthey're spectacular; they can do everything wonderfully well.
p21
aVSo, the answer is bio-mimicry: just copy nature directly.
p22
aVWe know from working on animals that the truth is
p23
aVthat's exactly what you don't want to do \u2014 because evolution works
p24
aVon the just-good-enough principle, not on a perfecting principle.
p25
aVAnd the constraints in building any organism, when you look at it,
p26
aVare really severe. Natural technologies have incredible constraints.
p27
aVThink about it. If you were an engineer and I told you
p28
aVthat you had to build an automobile, but it had to start off to be this big,
p29
aVthen it had to grow to be full size and had to work every step along the way.
p30
aVOr think about the fact that if you build an automobile, I'll tell you that you also \u2014 inside it \u2014
p31
aVhave to put a factory that allows you to make another automobile.
p32
aa(lp33
V(Laughter)
p34
aa(lp35
VAnd you can absolutely never, absolutely never, because of history
p36
aVand the inherited plan, start with a clean slate.
p37
aVSo, organisms have this important history.
p38
aVReally evolution works more like a tinkerer than an engineer.
p39
aVAnd this is really important when you begin to look at animals.
p40
aVInstead, we believe you need to be inspired by biology.
p41
aVYou need to discover the general principles of nature,
p42
aVand then use these analogies when they're advantageous.
p43
aVThis is a real challenge to do this, because animals,
p44
aVwhen you start to really look inside them \u2014 how they work \u2014
p45
aVappear hopelessly complex. There's no detailed history
p46
aVof the design plans, you can't go look it up anywhere.
p47
aVThey have way too many motions for their joints, too many muscles.
p48
aVEven the simplest animal we think of, something like an insect,
p49
aVand they have more neurons and connections than you can imagine.
p50
aa(lp51
VHow can you make sense of this? Well, we believed \u2014
p52
aVand we hypothesized \u2014 that one way animals could work simply,
p53
aVis if the control of their movements
p54
aVtended to be built into their bodies themselves.
p55
aVWhat we discovered was that two-, four-, six- and eight-legged animals
p56
aVall produce the same forces on the ground when they move.
p57
aVThey all work like this kangaroo, they bounce.
p58
aVAnd they can be modeled by a spring-mass system that we call the spring mass system
p59
aVbecause we're biomechanists. It's actually a pogo stick.
p60
aVThey all produce the pattern of a pogo stick. How is that true?
p61
aVWell, a human, one of your legs works like two legs of a trotting dog,
p62
aVor works like three legs, together as one, of a trotting insect,
p63
aVor four legs as one of a trotting crab.
p64
aVAnd then they alternate in their propulsion,
p65
aVbut the patterns are all the same. Almost every organism we've looked at this way
p66
aV\u2014 you'll see next week, I'll give you a hint,
p67
aVthere'll be an article coming out that says that really big things
p68
aVlike T. rex probably couldn't do this, but you'll see that next week.
p69
aa(lp70
VNow, what's interesting is the animals, then \u2014 we said \u2014 bounce along
p71
aVthe vertical plane this way, and in our collaborations with Pixar,
p72
aVin "A Bug's Life," we discussed the
p73
aVbipedal nature of the characters of the ants.
p74
aVAnd we told them, of course, they move in another plane as well.
p75
aVAnd they asked us this question. They say, "Why model
p76
aVjust in the sagittal plane or the vertical plane,
p77
aVwhen you're telling us these animals are moving
p78
aVin the horizontal plane?" This is a good question.
p79
aVNobody in biology ever modeled it this way.
p80
aVWe took their advice and we modeled the animals moving
p81
aVin the horizontal plane as well. We took their three legs,
p82
aVwe collapsed them down as one.
p83
aVWe got some of the best mathematicians in the world
p84
aVfrom Princeton to work on this problem.
p85
aVAnd we were able to create a model
p86
aVwhere animals are not only bouncing up and down,
p87
aVbut they're also bouncing side to side at the same time.
p88
aVAnd many organisms fit this kind of pattern.
p89
aVNow, why is this important to have this model?
p90
aVBecause it's very interesting. When you take this model
p91
aVand you perturb it, you give it a push,
p92
aVas it bumps into something, it self-stabilizes, with no brain
p93
aVor no reflexes, just by the structure alone.
p94
aVIt's a beautiful model. Let's look at the mathematics.
p95
aa(lp96
V(Laughter)
p97
aa(lp98
VThat's enough!
p99
aa(lp100
V(Laughter)
p101
aa(lp102
VThe animals, when you look at them running,
p103
aVappear to be self-stabilizing like this,
p104
aVusing basically springy legs. That is, the legs can do
p105
aVcomputations on their own; the control algorithms, in a sense,
p106
aVare embedded in the form of the animal itself.
p107
aVWhy haven't we been more inspired by nature and these kinds of discoveries?
p108
aVWell, I would argue that human technologies are really different from
p109
aVnatural technologies, at least they have been so far.
p110
aVThink about the typical kind of robot that you see.
p111
aVHuman technologies have tended to be large, flat,
p112
aVwith right angles, stiff, made of metal. They have rolling devices
p113
aVand axles. There are very few motors, very few sensors.
p114
aVWhereas nature tends to be small, and curved,
p115
aVand it bends and twists, and has legs instead, and appendages,
p116
aVand has many muscles and many, many sensors.
p117
aVSo it's a very different design. However, what's changing,
p118
aVwhat's really exciting \u2014 and I'll show you some of that next \u2014
p119
aVis that as human technology takes on more of the characteristics
p120
aVof nature, then nature really can become a much more useful teacher.
p121
aa(lp122
VAnd here's one example that's really exciting.
p123
aVThis is a collaboration we have with Stanford.
p124
aVAnd they developed this new technique, called Shape Deposition Manufacturing.
p125
aVIt's a technique where they can mix materials together and mold any shape
p126
aVthat they like, and put in the material properties.
p127
aVThey can embed sensors and actuators right in the form itself.
p128
aVFor example, here's a leg: the clear part is stiff,
p129
aVthe white part is compliant, and you don't need any axles there or anything.
p130
aVIt just bends by itself beautifully.
p131
aVSo, you can put those properties in. It inspired them to show off
p132
aVthis design by producing a little robot they named Sprawl.
p133
aVOur work has also inspired another robot, a biologically inspired bouncing robot,
p134
aVfrom the University of Michigan and McGill
p135
aVnamed RHex, for robot hexapod, and this one's autonomous.
p136
aVLet's go to the video, and let me show you some of these animals moving
p137
aVand then some of the simple robots
p138
aVthat have been inspired by our discoveries.
p139
aVHere's what some of you did this morning, although you did it outside,
p140
aVnot on a treadmill.
p141
aVHere's what we do.
p142
aa(lp143
V(Laughter)
p144
aa(lp145
VThis is a death's head cockroach. This is an American cockroach
p146
aVyou think you don't have in your kitchen.
p147
aVThis is an eight-legged scorpion, six-legged ant, forty-four-legged centipede.
p148
aVNow, I said all these animals are sort of working like pogo sticks \u2014
p149
aVthey're bouncing along as they move. And you can see that
p150
aVin this ghost crab, from the beaches of Panama and North Carolina.
p151
aVIt goes up to four meters per second when it runs.
p152
aVIt actually leaps into the air, and has aerial phases
p153
aVwhen it does it, like a horse, and you'll see it's bouncing here.
p154
aVWhat we discovered is whether you look at the leg of a human
p155
aVlike Richard, or a cockroach, or a crab, or a kangaroo,
p156
aVthe relative leg stiffness of that spring is the same for everything we've seen so far.
p157
aVNow, what good are springy legs then? What can they do?
p158
aVWell, we wanted to see if they allowed the animals
p159
aVto have greater stability and maneuverability.
p160
aVSo, we built a terrain that had obstacles three times the hip height
p161
aVof the animals that we're looking at.
p162
aVAnd we were certain they couldn't do this. And here's what they did.
p163
aVThe animal ran over it and it didn't even slow down!
p164
aVIt didn't decrease its preferred speed at all.
p165
aVWe couldn't believe that it could do this. It said to us
p166
aVthat if you could build a robot with very simple, springy legs,
p167
aVyou could make it as maneuverable as any that's ever been built.
p168
aa(lp169
VHere's the first example of that. This is the Stanford
p170
aVShape Deposition Manufactured robot, named Sprawl.
p171
aVIt has six legs \u2014 there are the tuned, springy legs.
p172
aVIt moves in a gait that an insect uses, and here it is
p173
aVgoing on the treadmill. Now, what's important about this robot,
p174
aVcompared to other robots, is that it can't see anything,
p175
aVit can't feel anything, it doesn't have a brain, yet it can maneuver
p176
aVover these obstacles without any difficulty whatsoever.
p177
aVIt's this technique of building the properties into the form.
p178
aVThis is a graduate student. This is what he's doing to his thesis project \u2014
p179
aVvery robust, if a graduate student
p180
aVdoes that to his thesis project.
p181
aa(lp182
V(Laughter)
p183
aa(lp184
VThis is from McGill and University of Michigan. This is the RHex,
p185
aVmaking its first outing in a demo.
p186
aa(lp187
V(Laughter)
p188
aa(lp189
VSame principle: it only has six moving parts,
p190
aVsix motors, but it has springy, tuned legs. It moves in the gait of the insect.
p191
aVIt has the middle leg moving in synchrony with the front,
p192
aVand the hind leg on the other side. Sort of an alternating tripod,
p193
aVand they can negotiate obstacles just like the animal.
p194
aa(lp195
V(Laughter)
p196
aa(lp197
V(Voice: Oh my God.)
p198
aa(lp199
V(Applause)
p200
aa(lp201
VRobert Full: It'll go on different surfaces \u2014 here's sand \u2014
p202
aValthough we haven't perfected the feet yet, but I'll talk about that later.
p203
aVHere's RHex entering the woods.
p204
aa(lp205
V(Laughter)
p206
aa(lp207
VAgain, this robot can't see anything, it can't feel anything,
p208
aVit has no brain. It's just working with a tuned mechanical system,
p209
aVwith very simple parts, but inspired from the fundamental dynamics of the animal.
p210
aV(Voice: Ah, I love him, Bob.) RF: Here's it going down a pathway.
p211
aVI presented this to the jet propulsion lab at NASA, and they said
p212
aVthat they had no ability to go down craters to look for ice,
p213
aVand life, ultimately, on Mars. And he said \u2014
p214
aVespecially with legged-robots, because they're way too complicated.
p215
aVNothing can do that. And I talk next. I showed them this video
p216
aVwith the simple design of RHex here. And just to convince them
p217
aVwe should go to Mars in 2011, I tinted the video orange
p218
aVjust to give them the sense of being on Mars.
p219
aa(lp220
V(Laughter)
p221
aa(lp222
V(Applause)
p223
aa(lp224
VAnother reason why animals have extraordinary performance,
p225
aVand can go anywhere, is because they have an effective interaction
p226
aVwith the environment. The animal I'm going to show you,
p227
aVthat we studied to look at this, is the gecko.
p228
aVWe have one here and notice its position. It's holding on.
p229
aVNow I'm going to challenge you. I'm going show you a video.
p230
aVOne of the animals is going to be running on the level,
p231
aVand the other one's going to be running up a wall. Which one's which?
p232
aVThey're going at a meter a second. How many think the one on the left
p233
aVis running up the wall?
p234
aa(lp235
V(Applause)
p236
aa(lp237
VOkay. The point is it's really hard to tell, isn't it? It's incredible,
p238
aVwe looked at students do this and they couldn't tell.
p239
aVThey can run up a wall at a meter a second, 15 steps per second,
p240
aVand they look like they're running on the level. How do they do this?
p241
aVIt's just phenomenal. The one on the right was going up the hill.
p242
aVHow do they do this? They have bizarre toes. They have toes
p243
aVthat uncurl like party favors when you blow them out,
p244
aVand then peel off the surface, like tape.
p245
aVLike if we had a piece of tape now, we'd peel it this way.
p246
aVThey do this with their toes. It's bizarre! This peeling inspired
p247
aViRobot \u2014 that we work with \u2014 to build Mecho-Geckos.
p248
aVHere's a legged version and a tractor version, or a bulldozer version.
p249
aVLet's see some of the geckos move with some video,
p250
aVand then I'll show you a little bit of a clip of the robots.
p251
aVHere's the gecko running up a vertical surface. There it goes,
p252
aVin real time. There it goes again. Obviously, we have to slow this down a little bit.
p253
aa(lp254
VYou can't use regular cameras.
p255
aVYou have to take 1,000 pictures per second to see this.
p256
aVAnd here's some video at 1,000 frames per second.
p257
aVNow, I want you to look at the animal's back.
p258
aVDo you see how much it's bending like that? We can't figure that out \u2014
p259
aVthat's an unsolved mystery. We don't know how it works.
p260
aVIf you have a son or a daughter that wants to come to Berkeley,
p261
aVcome to my lab and we'll figure this out. Okay, send them to Berkeley
p262
aVbecause that's the next thing I want to do. Here's the gecko mill.
p263
aa(lp264
V(Laughter)
p265
aa(lp266
VIt's a see-through treadmill with a see-through treadmill belt,
p267
aVso we can watch the animal's feet, and videotape them
p268
aVthrough the treadmill belt, to see how they move.
p269
aVHere's the animal that we have here, running on a vertical surface.
p270
aVPick a foot and try to watch a toe, and see if you can see what the animal's doing.
p271
aVSee it uncurl and then peel these toes.
p272
aVIt can do this in 14 milliseconds. It's unbelievable.
p273
aVHere are the robots that they inspire, the Mecho-Geckos from iRobot.
p274
aVFirst we'll see the animals toes peeling \u2014 look at that.
p275
aVAnd here's the peeling action of the Mecho-Gecko.
p276
aVIt uses a pressure-sensitive adhesive to do it.
p277
aVPeeling in the animal. Peeling in the Mecho-Gecko \u2014
p278
aVthat allows them climb autonomously. Can go on the flat surface,
p279
aVtransition to a wall, and then go onto a ceiling.
p280
aVThere's the bulldozer version. Now, it doesn't use pressure-sensitive glue.
p281
aVThe animal does not use that.
p282
aVBut that's what we're limited to, at the moment.
p283
aa(lp284
VWhat does the animal do? The animal has weird toes.
p285
aVAnd if you look at the toes, they have these little leaves there,
p286
aVand if you blow them up and zoom in, you'll see
p287
aVthat's there's little striations in these leaves.
p288
aVAnd if you zoom in 270 times, you'll see it looks like a rug.
p289
aVAnd if you blow that up, and zoom in 900 times,
p290
aVyou see there are hairs there, tiny hairs. And if you look carefully,
p291
aVthose tiny hairs have striations. And if you zoom in on those 30,000 times,
p292
aVyou'll see each hair has split ends.
p293
aVAnd if you blow those up, they have these little structures on the end.
p294
aVThe smallest branch of the hairs looks like spatulae,
p295
aVand an animal like that has one billion of these nano-size split ends,
p296
aVto get very close to the surface. In fact, there's the diameter of your hair \u2014
p297
aVa gecko has two million of these, and each hair has 100 to 1,000 split ends.
p298
aVThink of the contact of that that's possible.
p299
aa(lp300
VWe were fortunate to work with another group
p301
aVat Stanford that built us a special manned sensor,
p302
aVthat we were able to measure the force of an individual hair.
p303
aVHere's an individual hair with a little split end there.
p304
aVWhen we measured the forces, they were enormous.
p305
aVThey were so large that a patch of hairs about this size \u2014
p306
aVthe gecko's foot could support the weight of a small child,
p307
aVabout 40 pounds, easily. Now, how do they do it?
p308
aVWe've recently discovered this. Do they do it by friction?
p309
aVNo, force is too low. Do they do it by electrostatics?
p310
aVNo, you can change the charge \u2014 they still hold on.
p311
aVDo they do it by interlocking? That's kind of a like a Velcro-like thing.
p312
aVNo, you can put them on molecular smooth surfaces \u2014 they don't do it.
p313
aVHow about suction? They stick on in a vacuum.
p314
aVHow about wet adhesion? Or capillary adhesion?
p315
aVThey don't have any glue, and they even stick under water just fine.
p316
aVIf you put their foot under water, they grab on.
p317
aVHow do they do it then? Believe it or not, they grab on
p318
aVby intermolecular forces, by Van der Waals forces.
p319
aa(lp320
VYou know, you probably had this a long time ago in chemistry,
p321
aVwhere you had these two atoms, they're close together,
p322
aVand the electrons are moving around. That tiny force is sufficient
p323
aVto allow them to do that because it's added up so many times
p324
aVwith these small structures.
p325
aVWhat we're doing is, we're taking that inspiration of the hairs,
p326
aVand with another colleague at Berkeley, we're manufacturing them.
p327
aVAnd just recently we've made a breakthrough, where we now believe
p328
aVwe're going to be able to create the first synthetic, self-cleaning,
p329
aVdry adhesive. Many companies are interested in this.
p330
aa(lp331
V(Laughter)
p332
aa(lp333
VWe also presented to Nike even.
p334
aa(lp335
V(Laughter)
p336
aa(lp337
V(Applause)
p338
aa(lp339
VWe'll see where this goes. We were so excited about this
p340
aVthat we realized that that small-size scale \u2014
p341
aVand where everything gets sticky, and gravity doesn't matter anymore \u2014
p342
aVwe needed to look at ants and their feet, because
p343
aVone of my other colleagues at Berkeley has built a six-millimeter silicone
p344
aVrobot with legs. But it gets stuck. It doesn't move very well.
p345
aVBut the ants do, and we'll figure out why, so that ultimately
p346
aVwe'll make this move. And imagine: you're going to be able
p347
aVto have swarms of these six-millimeter robots available to run around.
p348
aVWhere's this going? I think you can see it already.
p349
aa(lp350
VClearly, the Internet is already having eyes and ears,
p351
aVyou have web cams and so forth. But it's going to also have legs and hands.
p352
aVYou're going to be able to do programmable
p353
aVwork through these kinds of robots, so that you can run,
p354
aVfly and swim anywhere. We saw David Kelly is at the beginning of that with his fish.
p355
aVSo, in conclusion, I think the message is clear.
p356
aVIf you need a message, if nature's not enough, if you care about
p357
aVsearch and rescue, or mine clearance, or medicine,
p358
aVor the various things we're working on, we must preserve
p359
aVnature's designs, otherwise these secrets will be lost forever.
p360
aVThank you.
