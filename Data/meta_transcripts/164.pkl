VThis is a picture of Maurice Druon,
p4
aVthe Honorary Perpetual Secretary of L'Academie francaise,
p5
aVthe French Academy.
p6
aVHe is splendidly attired in his 68,000-dollar uniform,
p7
aVbefitting the role of the French Academy
p8
aVas legislating the
p9
aVcorrect usage in French
p10
aVand perpetuating the language.
p11
aVThe French Academy has two main tasks:
p12
aVit compiles a dictionary of official French.
p13
aVThey're now working on their ninth edition,
p14
aVwhich they began in 1930, and they've reached the letter P.
p15
aVThey also legislate on correct usage,
p16
aVsuch as the proper term for what the French call "email,"
p17
aVwhich ought to be "courriel."
p18
aVThe World Wide Web, the French are told,
p19
aVought to be referred to as
p20
aV"la toile d'araignee mondiale" \u2014 the Global Spider Web \u2014
p21
aVrecommendations that the French gaily ignore.
p22
aa(lp23
VNow, this is one model of how language comes to be:
p24
aVnamely, it's legislated by an academy.
p25
aVBut anyone who looks at language realizes
p26
aVthat this is a rather silly conceit,
p27
aVthat language, rather, emerges from human minds interacting from one another.
p28
aVAnd this is visible in the unstoppable change in language \u2014
p29
aVthe fact that by the time the Academy finishes their dictionary,
p30
aVit will already be well out of date.
p31
aa(lp32
VWe see it in the
p33
aVconstant appearance of slang and jargon,
p34
aVof the historical change in languages,
p35
aVin divergence of dialects
p36
aVand the formation of new languages.
p37
aVSo language is not so much a creator or shaper of human nature,
p38
aVso much as a window onto human nature.
p39
aVIn a book that I'm currently working on,
p40
aVI hope to use language to shed light on
p41
aVa number of aspects of human nature,
p42
aVincluding the cognitive machinery
p43
aVwith which humans conceptualize the world
p44
aVand the relationship types that govern human interaction.
p45
aVAnd I'm going to say a few words about each one this morning.
p46
aa(lp47
VLet me start off with a technical problem in language
p48
aVthat I've worried about for quite some time \u2014
p49
aVand indulge me
p50
aVin my passion for verbs and how they're used.
p51
aVThe problem is, which verbs go in which constructions?
p52
aVThe verb is the chassis of the sentence.
p53
aVIt's the framework onto which the other parts are bolted.
p54
aa(lp55
VLet me give you a quick reminder
p56
aVof something that you've long forgotten.
p57
aVAn intransitive verb, such as "dine," for example,
p58
aVcan't take a direct object.
p59
aVYou have to say, "Sam dined," not, "Sam dined the pizza."
p60
aVA transitive verb mandates
p61
aVthat there has to be an object there:
p62
aV"Sam devoured the pizza." You can't just say, "Sam devoured."
p63
aVThere are dozens or scores of verbs of this type,
p64
aVeach of which shapes its sentence.
p65
aVSo, a problem in explaining how children learn language,
p66
aVa problem in teaching language to adults so that they don't make grammatical errors,
p67
aVand a problem in programming computers to use language is
p68
aVwhich verbs go in which constructions.
p69
aa(lp70
VFor example, the dative construction in English.
p71
aVYou can say, "Give a muffin to a mouse," the prepositional dative.
p72
aVOr, "Give a mouse a muffin," the double-object dative.
p73
aV"Promise anything to her," "Promise her anything," and so on.
p74
aVHundreds of verbs can go both ways.
p75
aVSo a tempting generalization for a child,
p76
aVfor an adult, for a computer
p77
aVis that any verb that can appear in the construction,
p78
aV"subject-verb-thing-to-a-recipient"
p79
aVcan also be expressed as "subject-verb-recipient-thing."
p80
aVA handy thing to have,
p81
aVbecause language is infinite,
p82
aVand you can't just parrot back the sentences that you've heard.
p83
aVYou've got to extract generalizations
p84
aVso you can produce and understand new sentences.
p85
aVThis would be an example of how to do that.
p86
aa(lp87
VUnfortunately, there appear to be idiosyncratic exceptions.
p88
aVYou can say, "Biff drove the car to Chicago,"
p89
aVbut not, "Biff drove Chicago the car."
p90
aVYou can say, "Sal gave Jason a headache,"
p91
aVbut it's a bit odd to say, "Sal gave a headache to Jason."
p92
aVThe solution is that these constructions, despite initial appearance,
p93
aVare not synonymous,
p94
aVthat when you crank up the microscope
p95
aVon human cognition, you see that there's a subtle difference
p96
aVin meaning between them.
p97
aVSo, "give the X to the Y,"
p98
aVthat construction corresponds to the thought
p99
aV"cause X to go to Y." Whereas "give the Y the X"
p100
aVcorresponds to the thought "cause Y to have X."
p101
aa(lp102
VNow, many events can be subject to either construal,
p103
aVkind of like the classic figure-ground reversal illusions,
p104
aVin which you can either pay attention
p105
aVto the particular object,
p106
aVin which case the space around it recedes from attention,
p107
aVor you can see the faces in the empty space,
p108
aVin which case the object recedes out of consciousness.
p109
aVHow are these construals reflected in language?
p110
aVWell, in both cases, the thing that is construed as being affected
p111
aVis expressed as the direct object,
p112
aVthe noun after the verb.
p113
aVSo, when you think of the event as causing the muffin to go somewhere \u2014
p114
aVwhere you're doing something to the muffin \u2014
p115
aVyou say, "Give the muffin to the mouse."
p116
aVWhen you construe it as "cause the mouse to have something,"
p117
aVyou're doing something to the mouse,
p118
aVand therefore you express it as, "Give the mouse the muffin."
p119
aa(lp120
VSo which verbs go in which construction \u2014
p121
aVthe problem with which I began \u2014
p122
aVdepends on whether the verb specifies a kind of motion
p123
aVor a kind of possession change.
p124
aVTo give something involves both causing something to go
p125
aVand causing someone to have.
p126
aVTo drive the car only causes something to go,
p127
aVbecause Chicago's not the kind of thing that can possess something.
p128
aVOnly humans can possess things.
p129
aVAnd to give someone a headache causes them to have the headache,
p130
aVbut it's not as if you're taking the headache out of your head
p131
aVand causing it to go to the other person,
p132
aVand implanting it in them.
p133
aVYou may just be loud or obnoxious,
p134
aVor some other way causing them to have the headache.
p135
aVSo, that's
p136
aVan example of the kind of thing that I do in my day job.
p137
aa(lp138
VSo why should anyone care?
p139
aVWell, there are a number of interesting conclusions, I think,
p140
aVfrom this and many similar kinds of analyses
p141
aVof hundreds of English verbs.
p142
aVFirst, there's a level of fine-grained conceptual structure,
p143
aVwhich we automatically and unconsciously compute
p144
aVevery time we produce or utter a sentence, that governs our use of language.
p145
aVYou can think of this as the language of thought, or "mentalese."
p146
aa(lp147
VIt seems to be based on a fixed set of concepts,
p148
aVwhich govern dozens of constructions and thousands of verbs \u2014
p149
aVnot only in English, but in all other languages \u2014
p150
aVfundamental concepts such as space,
p151
aVtime, causation and human intention,
p152
aVsuch as, what is the means and what is the ends?
p153
aVThese are reminiscent of the kinds of categories
p154
aVthat Immanuel Kant argued
p155
aVare the basic framework for human thought,
p156
aVand it's interesting that our unconscious use of language
p157
aVseems to reflect these Kantian categories.
p158
aVDoesn't care about perceptual qualities,
p159
aVsuch as color, texture, weight and speed,
p160
aVwhich virtually never differentiate
p161
aVthe use of verbs in different constructions.
p162
aa(lp163
VAn additional twist is that all of the constructions in English
p164
aVare used not only literally,
p165
aVbut in a quasi-metaphorical way.
p166
aVFor example, this construction, the dative,
p167
aVis used not only to transfer things,
p168
aVbut also for the metaphorical transfer of ideas,
p169
aVas when we say, "She told a story to me"
p170
aVor "told me a story,"
p171
aV"Max taught Spanish to the students" or "taught the students Spanish."
p172
aVIt's exactly the same construction,
p173
aVbut no muffins, no mice, nothing moving at all.
p174
aVIt evokes the container metaphor of communication,
p175
aVin which we conceive of ideas as objects,
p176
aVsentences as containers,
p177
aVand communication as a kind of sending.
p178
aVAs when we say we "gather" our ideas, to "put" them "into" words,
p179
aVand if our words aren't "empty" or "hollow,"
p180
aVwe might get these ideas "across" to a listener,
p181
aVwho can "unpack" our words to "extract" their "content."
p182
aa(lp183
VAnd indeed, this kind of verbiage is not the exception, but the rule.
p184
aVIt's very hard to find any example of abstract language
p185
aVthat is not based on some concrete metaphor.
p186
aVFor example, you can use the verb "go"
p187
aVand the prepositions "to" and "from"
p188
aVin a literal, spatial sense.
p189
aV"The messenger went from Paris to Istanbul."
p190
aVYou can also say, "Biff went from sick to well."
p191
aVHe needn't go anywhere. He could have been in bed the whole time,
p192
aVbut it's as if his health is a point in state space
p193
aVthat you conceptualize as moving.
p194
aVOr, "The meeting went from three to four,"
p195
aVin which we conceive of time as stretched along a line.
p196
aVLikewise, we use "force" to indicate
p197
aVnot only physical force,
p198
aVas in, "Rose forced the door to open,"
p199
aVbut also interpersonal force,
p200
aVas in, "Rose forced Sadie to go," not necessarily by manhandling her,
p201
aVbut by issuing a threat.
p202
aVOr, "Rose forced herself to go,"
p203
aVas if there were two entities inside Rose's head,
p204
aVengaged in a tug of a war.
p205
aa(lp206
VSecond conclusion is that the ability to conceive
p207
aVof a given event in two different ways,
p208
aVsuch as "cause something to go to someone"
p209
aVand "causing someone to have something,"
p210
aVI think is a fundamental feature of human thought,
p211
aVand it's the basis for much human argumentation,
p212
aVin which people don't differ so much on the facts
p213
aVas on how they ought to be construed.
p214
aVJust to give you a few examples:
p215
aV"ending a pregnancy" versus "killing a fetus;"
p216
aV"a ball of cells" versus "an unborn child;"
p217
aV"invading Iraq" versus "liberating Iraq;"
p218
aV"redistributing wealth" versus "confiscating earnings."
p219
aVAnd I think the biggest picture of all
p220
aVwould take seriously the fact
p221
aVthat so much of our verbiage about abstract events
p222
aVis based on a concrete metaphor
p223
aVand see human intelligence itself
p224
aVas consisting of a repertoire of concepts \u2014
p225
aVsuch as objects, space, time, causation and intention \u2014
p226
aVwhich are useful in a social, knowledge-intensive species,
p227
aVwhose evolution you can well imagine,
p228
aVand a process of metaphorical abstraction
p229
aVthat allows us to bleach these concepts
p230
aVof their original conceptual content \u2014
p231
aVspace, time and force \u2014
p232
aVand apply them to new abstract domains,
p233
aVtherefore allowing a species that evolved
p234
aVto deal with rocks and tools and animals,
p235
aVto conceptualize mathematics, physics, law
p236
aVand other abstract domains.
p237
aa(lp238
VWell, I said I'd talk about two windows on human nature \u2014
p239
aVthe cognitive machinery with which we conceptualize the world,
p240
aVand now I'm going to say a few words about the relationship types
p241
aVthat govern human social interaction,
p242
aVagain, as reflected in language.
p243
aVAnd I'll start out with a puzzle, the puzzle of indirect speech acts.
p244
aVNow, I'm sure most of you have seen the movie "Fargo."
p245
aVAnd you might remember the scene in which
p246
aVthe kidnapper is pulled over by a police officer,
p247
aVis asked to show his driver's license
p248
aVand holds his wallet out
p249
aVwith a 50-dollar bill extending
p250
aVat a slight angle out of the wallet.
p251
aVAnd he says, "I was just thinking
p252
aVthat maybe we could take care of it here in Fargo,"
p253
aVwhich everyone, including the audience,
p254
aVinterprets as a veiled bribe.
p255
aVThis kind of indirect speech is rampant in language.
p256
aVFor example, in polite requests,
p257
aVif someone says, "If you could pass the guacamole,
p258
aVthat would be awesome,"
p259
aVwe know exactly what he means,
p260
aVeven though that's a rather bizarre
p261
aVconcept being expressed.
p262
aa(lp263
V(Laughter)
p264
aa(lp265
V"Would you like to come up and see my etchings?"
p266
aVI think most people
p267
aVunderstand the intent behind that.
p268
aVAnd likewise, if someone says,
p269
aV"Nice store you've got there. It would be a real shame if something happened to it" \u2014
p270
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p271
aVwe understand that as a veiled threat,
p272
aVrather than a musing of hypothetical possibilities.
p273
aVSo the puzzle is, why are bribes,
p274
aVpolite requests, solicitations and threats so often veiled?
p275
aVNo one's fooled.
p276
aVBoth parties know exactly what the speaker means,
p277
aVand the speaker knows the listener knows
p278
aVthat the speaker knows that the listener knows, etc., etc.
p279
aVSo what's going on?
p280
aa(lp281
VI think the key idea is that language
p282
aVis a way of negotiating relationships,
p283
aVand human relationships fall into a number of types.
p284
aVThere's an influential taxonomy by the anthropologist Alan Fiske,
p285
aVin which relationships can be categorized, more or less,
p286
aVinto communality, which works on the principle
p287
aV"what's mine is thine, what's thine is mine,"
p288
aVthe kind of mindset that operates within a family, for example;
p289
aVdominance, whose principle is "don't mess with me;"
p290
aVreciprocity, "you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours;"
p291
aVand sexuality, in the immortal words of Cole Porter, "Let's do it."
p292
aa(lp293
VNow, relationship types can be negotiated.
p294
aVEven though there are default situations
p295
aVin which one of these mindsets can be applied,
p296
aVthey can be stretched and extended.
p297
aVFor example, communality applies most naturally
p298
aVwithin family or friends,
p299
aVbut it can be used to try to transfer
p300
aVthe mentality of sharing
p301
aVto groups that ordinarily would not be disposed to exercise it.
p302
aVFor example, in brotherhoods, fraternal organizations,
p303
aVsororities, locutions like "the family of man,"
p304
aVyou try to get people who are not related
p305
aVto use the relationship type that would ordinarily
p306
aVbe appropriate to close kin.
p307
aa(lp308
VNow, mismatches \u2014 when one person assumes one relationship type,
p309
aVand another assumes a different one \u2014 can be awkward.
p310
aVIf you went over and you helped yourself
p311
aVto a shrimp off your boss' plate,
p312
aVfor example, that would be an awkward situation.
p313
aVOr if a dinner guest after the meal
p314
aVpulled out his wallet and offered to pay you for the meal,
p315
aVthat would be rather awkward as well.
p316
aVIn less blatant cases,
p317
aVthere's still a kind of negotiation that often goes on.
p318
aVIn the workplace, for example,
p319
aVthere's often a tension over whether an employee
p320
aVcan socialize with the boss,
p321
aVor refer to him or her
p322
aVon a first-name basis.
p323
aVIf two friends have a
p324
aVreciprocal transaction, like selling a car,
p325
aVit's well known that this can be a source
p326
aVof tension or awkwardness.
p327
aVIn dating, the transition
p328
aVfrom friendship to sex
p329
aVcan lead to, notoriously, various forms of awkwardness,
p330
aVand as can sex in the workplace,
p331
aVin which we call the conflict between a
p332
aVdominant and a sexual relationship "sexual harassment."
p333
aa(lp334
VWell, what does this have to do with language?
p335
aVWell, language, as a social interaction,
p336
aVhas to satisfy two conditions.
p337
aVYou have to convey the actual content \u2014
p338
aVhere we get back to the container metaphor.
p339
aVYou want to express the bribe, the command, the promise,
p340
aVthe solicitation and so on,
p341
aVbut you also have to negotiate
p342
aVand maintain the kind of relationship
p343
aVyou have with the other person.
p344
aVThe solution, I think, is that we use language at two levels:
p345
aVthe literal form signals
p346
aVthe safest relationship with the listener,
p347
aVwhereas the implicated content \u2014
p348
aVthe reading between the lines that we count on the listener to perform \u2014
p349
aVallows the listener to derive the interpretation
p350
aVwhich is most relevant in context,
p351
aVwhich possibly initiates a changed relationship.
p352
aa(lp353
VThe simplest example of this is in the polite request.
p354
aVIf you express your request as a conditional \u2014
p355
aV"if you could open the window, that would be great" \u2014
p356
aVeven though the content is an imperative,
p357
aVthe fact that you're not using the imperative voice
p358
aVmeans that you're not acting as if you're in a relationship of dominance,
p359
aVwhere you could presuppose the compliance of the other person.
p360
aVOn the other hand, you want the damn guacamole.
p361
aVBy expressing it as an if-then statement,
p362
aVyou can get the message across
p363
aVwithout appearing to boss another person around.
p364
aa(lp365
VAnd in a more subtle way, I think, this works
p366
aVfor all of the veiled speech acts
p367
aVinvolving plausible deniability:
p368
aVthe bribes, threats, propositions,
p369
aVsolicitations and so on.
p370
aVOne way of thinking about it is to imagine what it would be like
p371
aVif language \u2014 where it could only be used literally.
p372
aVAnd you can think of it in terms of a
p373
aVgame-theoretic payoff matrix.
p374
aVPut yourself in the position of the
p375
aVkidnapper wanting to bribe the officer.
p376
aVThere's a high stakes
p377
aVin the two possibilities
p378
aVof having a dishonest officer or an honest officer.
p379
aVIf you don't bribe the officer,
p380
aVthen you will get a traffic ticket \u2014
p381
aVor, as is the case of "Fargo," worse \u2014
p382
aVwhether the honest officer
p383
aVis honest or dishonest.
p384
aVNothing ventured, nothing gained.
p385
aVIn that case, the consequences are rather severe.
p386
aVOn the other hand, if you extend the bribe,
p387
aVif the officer is dishonest,
p388
aVyou get a huge payoff of going free.
p389
aVIf the officer is honest, you get a huge penalty
p390
aVof being arrested for bribery.
p391
aVSo this is a rather fraught situation.
p392
aa(lp393
VOn the other hand, with indirect language,
p394
aVif you issue a veiled bribe,
p395
aVthen the dishonest officer
p396
aVcould interpret it as a bribe,
p397
aVin which case you get the payoff of going free.
p398
aVThe honest officer can't hold you to it as being a bribe,
p399
aVand therefore, you get the nuisance of the traffic ticket.
p400
aVSo you get the best of both worlds.
p401
aVAnd a similar analysis, I think,
p402
aVcan apply to the potential awkwardness
p403
aVof a sexual solicitation,
p404
aVand other cases where plausible deniability is an asset.
p405
aVI think this affirms
p406
aVsomething that's long been known by diplomats \u2014
p407
aVnamely, that the vagueness of language,
p408
aVfar from being a bug or an imperfection,
p409
aVactually might be a feature of language,
p410
aVone that we use to our advantage in social interactions.
p411
aa(lp412
VSo to sum up: language is a collective human creation,
p413
aVreflecting human nature,
p414
aVhow we conceptualize reality,
p415
aVhow we relate to one another.
p416
aVAnd then by analyzing the various quirks and complexities of language,
p417
aVI think we can get a window onto what makes us tick.
p418
aVThank you very much.
