VWe humans are becoming an urban species,
p4
aVso cities, they are our natural habitat.
p5
aVThat is where we live.
p6
aVIn 2014, over 54 percent
p7
aVof the world population
p8
aVwas living in cities,
p9
aVand I can bet you
p10
aVthat so many of these people have thought
p11
aVof how they would do things differently,
p12
aVlike if I only had the tools
p13
aVto change things in my city,
p14
aVwhat would I do?
p15
aVWhat would my dream city be like?
p16
aVAnd these tools,
p17
aVthis is just what we gave them.
p18
aVTwo years ago, my team and I,
p19
aVwe released a game,
p20
aV"Cities: Skylines."
p21
aVIt is a game about building cities.
p22
aa(lp23
VSo I have always been interested in cities as systems.
p24
aVIt's something that I find immensely interesting.
p25
aVBut what I didn't understand
p26
aVwas that I am not alone in this.
p27
aVPeople love cities.
p28
aVThey are interested. They have ideas.
p29
aVThe game was an instant hit.
p30
aVSo far, over three and a half million people have played it.
p31
aa(lp32
VAnd it's not just about playing.
p33
aVWe also have really awesome sharing systems.
p34
aVSo people play, they create cities
p35
aVand then they are sharing these creations,
p36
aVshowing off what they have made.
p37
aVAnd what I will show you
p38
aVis some of these cities
p39
aVcreated by the players.
p40
aa(lp41
VSo the game is about self-expression,
p42
aVcreativity,
p43
aVnot just overcoming the challenges posed by the simulation.
p44
aVIt is about showing what your cities look like.
p45
aa(lp46
VSo I have a couple of videos.
p47
aVThese are from YouTube.
p48
aVAnd these are some of the most interesting city designs I have seen.
p49
aVSo they are all different,
p50
aVand I hope you like all of these.
p51
aa(lp52
VThis one is called The Netherlands.
p53
aVIt's by Silvarret.
p54
aVAnd when you start the game,
p55
aVyou have an empty piece of land.
p56
aVThis land, it can be based on the real world,
p57
aVit can be hand-crafted in the map editor,
p58
aVor you can, of course, download a city made by someone else
p59
aVand play in that.
p60
aVBut what Silvarret has done here
p61
aVis that what he wanted to make
p62
aVwas not a real city.
p63
aVThis is a fantasy city,
p64
aVeven though it looks real.
p65
aVSo what he wanted to do was a fantasy city that could be in the Netherlands.
p66
aVSo he kind of investigated
p67
aVwhat are the characteristics of cities in the Netherlands
p68
aVand combined a couple of those,
p69
aVand this is what he created.
p70
aVSo it is a city,
p71
aVbut it is not a real city,
p72
aVbut it could be.
p73
aVIt looks just like the Netherlands.
p74
aVSo the places are really densely populated.
p75
aVSo what you need is highways, trains,
p76
aVanything connecting these small town centers together.
p77
aVLots of people, lots of moving,
p78
aVso transportation is the key here.
p79
aa(lp80
VBut then let's go even more on the fantasy side.
p81
aVLet's go into the future.
p82
aVThis is one of my personal favorites.
p83
aVThese city designs are what I love the most.
p84
aVSo this is a tiered city by Conflictnerd,
p85
aVand the basic idea is that you have concentric circle routes.
p86
aVSo the city is a big circle
p87
aVwith tinier circles inside.
p88
aVAnd the thing is that you put all of the services in the center,
p89
aVand then people actually live on the outer ring,
p90
aVbecause there is less traffic, less noise, less pollution,
p91
aVso that is where you want to live.
p92
aVBut the services are still really close by.
p93
aVThey are in the center.
p94
aVAnd this is the soul of the game.
p95
aVThe player has to understand
p96
aVwhat are the wishes, what are the needs
p97
aVof the tiny people living in the cities.
p98
aVSo you need to know where you should put the things.
p99
aVLike, it's not enough to have a hospital.
p100
aVIt needs to be accessible.
p101
aVCitizens need to reach the hospital.
p102
aVAnd this is one way to do it.
p103
aVSo maybe this is something that we might be seeing someday.
p104
aa(lp105
VAnd then even more into the future.
p106
aVAstergea by Yuttho.
p107
aVSo Yuttho does YouTube videos and plays the game.
p108
aVWhat he did here was actually a 12-point series
p109
aVof creating this city.
p110
aVSo what he does is he plays the game,
p111
aVhe records it
p112
aVand he explains as he's going what he's doing and why.
p113
aVAnd as a part of this series,
p114
aVhe actually did an interview with an actual urban planner
p115
aVcalled Jeff Speck.
p116
aVAnd Speck is an expert on the concept of walkability.
p117
aVThe basic idea is that if you want your citizens to walk,
p118
aVwhich is kind of beneficial,
p119
aVyou actually need to have walking as a reasonable means of transportation.
p120
aVIt should be a good way to reach places.
p121
aVSo what Yuttho did was that he explained this concept,
p122
aVhe had Speck explain it, too,
p123
aVand then he applied it to the city that he was building.
p124
aVSo what we are seeing is Yuttho's vision of the future:
p125
aVlots of public transportation, walkways, plazas,
p126
aVconnecting high-rise buildings.
p127
aVMaybe this is what the future might look like.
p128
aVAnd the game system works really well for this.
p129
aa(lp130
VWe are seeing some real-world uses to this game.
p131
aVSo we know that some urban planners are using it as a sketching tool,
p132
aVso while the simulation is not completely realistic,
p133
aVit is realistic enough that if something works in the game,
p134
aVit is highly likely that it will also work in the real world,
p135
aVso that you can actually try out things,
p136
aVsee if this intersection might fit this kind of a situation.
p137
aVIf we build a new road, would it help?
p138
aVAnd this is what you can do with this game.
p139
aa(lp140
VThere was one really interesting contest held
p141
aVby the Finnish city of Hämeenlinna.
p142
aVSo what they did was that they had a new area
p143
aVthat they wanted to develop in the city.
p144
aVThey made a map with the existing city,
p145
aVthey left empty the area that they would want to develop
p146
aVand shared this map.
p147
aVSo anyone could download the map,
p148
aVplay the game, build the area
p149
aVand submit their creations to the city council.
p150
aVSo they have not yet built anything,
p151
aVbut it might just be that they use one of these plans
p152
aVmade with the game
p153
aVto actually build the real city.
p154
aa(lp155
VAnd these videos that I have shown you,
p156
aVthese are the people who are coming up with new kinds of solutions.
p157
aVWe know that cities are growing.
p158
aVThey're getting bigger as we go,
p159
aVand the percentage of population living in cities is projected to rise.
p160
aVSo we need the solutions
p161
aVand these people, playing the game,
p162
aVthey are trying out different kinds of solutions.
p163
aVThey might have something that is really important.
p164
aVSo what we are seeing here is dream cities that might be real one day.
p165
aVSo it might be
p166
aVthat this is not just a game.
p167
aVIt might be a way
p168
aVto decide our own fate.
p169
aa(lp170
