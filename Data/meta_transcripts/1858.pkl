VI was about 10 years old
p4
aVon a camping trip with my dad
p5
aVin the Adirondack Mountains, a wilderness area
p6
aVin the northern part of New York State.
p7
aVIt was a beautiful day.
p8
aVThe forest was sparkling.
p9
aVThe sun made the leaves glow like stained glass,
p10
aVand if it weren't for the path we were following,
p11
aVwe could almost pretend we were
p12
aVthe first human beings to ever walk that land.
p13
aa(lp14
VWe got to our campsite.
p15
aVIt was a lean-to on a bluff
p16
aVlooking over a crystal, beautiful lake,
p17
aVwhen I discovered a horror.
p18
aVBehind the lean-to was a dump,
p19
aVmaybe 40 feet square
p20
aVwith rotting apple cores
p21
aVand balled-up aluminum foil,
p22
aVand a dead sneaker.
p23
aVAnd I was astonished,
p24
aVI was very angry, and I was deeply confused.
p25
aVThe campers who were too lazy
p26
aVto take out what they had brought in,
p27
aVwho did they think would clean up after them?
p28
aa(lp29
VThat question stayed with me,
p30
aVand it simplified a little.
p31
aVWho cleans up after us?
p32
aVHowever you configure
p33
aVor wherever you place the us,
p34
aVwho cleans up after us in Istanbul?
p35
aVWho cleans up after us in Rio
p36
aVor in Paris or in London?
p37
aVHere in New York,
p38
aVthe Department of Sanitation cleans up after us,
p39
aVto the tune of 11,000 tons of garbage
p40
aVand 2,000 tons of recyclables every day.
p41
aVI wanted to get to know them as individuals.
p42
aVI wanted to understand who takes the job.
p43
aVWhat's it like to wear the uniform
p44
aVand bear that burden?
p45
aa(lp46
VSo I started a research project with them.
p47
aVI rode in the trucks and walked the routes
p48
aVand interviewed people in offices and facilities
p49
aVall over the city,
p50
aVand I learned a lot,
p51
aVbut I was still an outsider.
p52
aVI needed to go deeper.
p53
aa(lp54
VSo I took the job as a sanitation worker.
p55
aVI didn't just ride in the trucks now. I drove the trucks.
p56
aVAnd I operated the mechanical brooms and I plowed the snow.
p57
aVIt was a remarkable privilege
p58
aVand an amazing education.
p59
aa(lp60
VEveryone asks about the smell.
p61
aVIt's there, but it's not as prevalent as you think,
p62
aVand on days when it is really bad,
p63
aVyou get used to it rather quickly.
p64
aVThe weight takes a long time to get used to.
p65
aVI knew people who were several years on the job
p66
aVwhose bodies were still adjusting to the burden
p67
aVof bearing on your body
p68
aVtons of trash every week.
p69
aa(lp70
VThen there's the danger.
p71
aVAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics,
p72
aVsanitation work is one of the 10 most dangerous
p73
aVoccupations in the country,
p74
aVand I learned why.
p75
aVYou're in and out of traffic all day,
p76
aVand it's zooming around you.
p77
aVIt just wants to get past you, so it's often
p78
aVthe motorist is not paying attention.
p79
aVThat's really bad for the worker.
p80
aVAnd then the garbage itself is full of hazards
p81
aVthat often fly back out of the truck
p82
aVand do terrible harm.
p83
aa(lp84
VI also learned about the relentlessness of trash.
p85
aVWhen you step off the curb
p86
aVand you see a city from behind a truck,
p87
aVyou come to understand that trash
p88
aVis like a force of nature unto itself.
p89
aVIt never stops coming.
p90
aVIt's also like a form of respiration or circulation.
p91
aVIt must always be in motion.
p92
aa(lp93
VAnd then there's the stigma.
p94
aVYou put on the uniform, and you become invisible
p95
aVuntil someone is upset with you for whatever reason
p96
aVlike you've blocked traffic with your truck,
p97
aVor you're taking a break too close to their home,
p98
aVor you're drinking coffee in their diner,
p99
aVand they will come and scorn you,
p100
aVand tell you that they don't want you anywhere near them.
p101
aVI find the stigma especially ironic,
p102
aVbecause I strongly believe that sanitation workers
p103
aVare the most important labor force
p104
aVon the streets of the city, for three reasons.
p105
aVThey are the first guardians of public health.
p106
aVIf they're not taking away trash
p107
aVefficiently and effectively every day,
p108
aVit starts to spill out of its containments,
p109
aVand the dangers inherent to it threaten us
p110
aVin very real ways.
p111
aVDiseases we've had in check for decades and centuries
p112
aVburst forth again and start to harm us.
p113
aVThe economy needs them.
p114
aVIf we can't throw out the old stuff,
p115
aVwe have no room for the new stuff,
p116
aVso then the engines of the economy
p117
aVstart to sputter when consumption is compromised.
p118
aVI'm not advocating capitalism, I'm just pointing out their relationship.
p119
aVAnd then there's what I call
p120
aVour average, necessary quotidian velocity.
p121
aVBy that I simply mean
p122
aVhow fast we're used to moving
p123
aVin the contemporary day and age.
p124
aVWe usually don't care for, repair, clean, carry around
p125
aVour coffee cup, our shopping bag,
p126
aVour bottle of water.
p127
aVWe use them, we throw them out, we forget about them,
p128
aVbecause we know there's a workforce
p129
aVon the other side that's going to take it all away.
p130
aa(lp131
VSo I want to suggest today a couple of ways
p132
aVto think about sanitation that will perhaps help
p133
aVameliorate the stigma
p134
aVand bring them into this conversation
p135
aVof how to craft a city that is sustainable and humane.
p136
aVTheir work, I think, is kind of liturgical.
p137
aVThey're on the streets every day, rhythmically.
p138
aVThey wear a uniform in many cities.
p139
aVYou know when to expect them.
p140
aVAnd their work lets us do our work.
p141
aVThey are almost a form of reassurance.
p142
aVThe flow that they maintain
p143
aVkeeps us safe from ourselves,
p144
aVfrom our own dross, our cast-offs,
p145
aVand that flow must be maintained always
p146
aVno matter what.
p147
aa(lp148
VOn the day after September 11 in 2001,
p149
aVI heard the growl of a sanitation truck on the street,
p150
aVand I grabbed my infant son and I ran downstairs
p151
aVand there was a man doing his paper recycling route
p152
aVlike he did every Wednesday.
p153
aVAnd I tried to thank him for doing his work
p154
aVon that day of all days,
p155
aVbut I started to cry.
p156
aVAnd he looked at me,
p157
aVand he just nodded, and he said,
p158
aV"We're going to be okay.
p159
aVWe're going to be okay."
p160
aVIt was a little while later that I started
p161
aVmy research with sanitation,
p162
aVand I met that man again.
p163
aVHis name is Paulie, and we worked together many times,
p164
aVand we became good friends.
p165
aa(lp166
VI want to believe that Paulie was right.
p167
aVWe are going to be okay.
p168
aVBut in our effort to reconfigure
p169
aVhow we as a species exist on this planet,
p170
aVwe must include and take account of
p171
aVall the costs, including the very real human cost
p172
aVof the labor.
p173
aVAnd we also would be well informed
p174
aVto reach out to the people who do that work
p175
aVand get their expertise
p176
aVon how do we think about,
p177
aVhow do we create systems around sustainability
p178
aVthat perhaps take us from curbside recycling,
p179
aVwhich is a remarkable success across 40 years,
p180
aVacross the United States and countries around the world,
p181
aVand lift us up to a broader horizon
p182
aVwhere we're looking at other forms of waste
p183
aVthat could be lessened
p184
aVfrom manufacturing and industrial sources.
p185
aVMunicipal waste, what we think of when we talk about garbage,
p186
aVaccounts for three percent of the nation's waste stream.
p187
aVIt's a remarkable statistic.
p188
aa(lp189
VSo in the flow of your days,
p190
aVin the flow of your lives,
p191
aVnext time you see someone whose job is
p192
aVto clean up after you,
p193
aVtake a moment to acknowledge them.
p194
aVTake a moment to say thank you.
