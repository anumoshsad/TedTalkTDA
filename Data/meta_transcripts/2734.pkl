VThe school of architecture that I studied at some 30 years ago
p4
aVhappened to be across the street from the wonderful art gallery
p5
aVdesigned by the great architect Louis Kahn.
p6
aVI love the building, and I used to visit it quite often.
p7
aVOne day,
p8
aVI saw the security guard run his hand across the concrete wall.
p9
aVAnd it was the way he did it,
p10
aVthe expression on his face \u2014
p11
aVsomething touched me.
p12
aVI could see that the security guard was moved by the building
p13
aVand that architecture has that capacity
p14
aVto move you.
p15
aVI could see it, and I remember thinking,
p16
aV"Wow. How does architecture do that?"
p17
aa(lp18
VAt school, I was learning to design,
p19
aVbut here \u2014 here was a reaction of the heart.
p20
aVAnd it touched me to the core.
p21
aa(lp22
VYou know, you aspire for beauty,
p23
aVfor sensuousness, for atmosphere, the emotional response.
p24
aVThat's the realm of the ineffable
p25
aVand the immeasurable.
p26
aVAnd that's what you live for:
p27
aVa chance to try.
p28
aa(lp29
VSo in 2003, there was an open call for designs
p30
aVfor the Bahá'í Temple for South America.
p31
aVThis was the first temple in all of South America.
p32
aVIt's a continental temple,
p33
aVa hugely important milestone for the Bahá'í community,
p34
aVbecause this would be the last of the continental temples
p35
aVand would open the door for national and local temples to be built
p36
aVaround the world.
p37
aa(lp38
VAnd the brief was deceptively simple
p39
aVand unique in the annals of religion:
p40
aVa circular room, nine sides, nine entrances, nine paths,
p41
aVallowing you to come to the temple from all directions,
p42
aVnine symbolizing completeness,
p43
aVperfection.
p44
aVNo pulpit, no sermons,
p45
aVas there are no clergy in the Bahá'í faith.
p46
aVAnd in a world which is putting up walls,
p47
aVthe design needed to express in form
p48
aVthe very opposite.
p49
aVIt had to be open, welcoming
p50
aVto people of all faiths, walks of life, backgrounds,
p51
aVor no faith at all;
p52
aVa new form of sacred space
p53
aVwith no pattern
p54
aVor models to draw from.
p55
aVIt was like designing one of the first churches for Christianity
p56
aVor one of the first mosques for Islam.
p57
aa(lp58
VSo we live in a secular world.
p59
aVHow do you design sacred space today?
p60
aVAnd how do you even define what's sacred today?
p61
aa(lp62
VI stumbled across this beautiful quote from the Bahá'í writings,
p63
aVand it speaks to prayer.
p64
aVIt says that if you reach out in prayer,
p65
aVand if your prayer is answered \u2014 which is already very interesting \u2014
p66
aVthat the pillars of your heart will become ashine.
p67
aa(lp68
VAnd I loved this idea of the inner and the outer,
p69
aVlike when you see someone and you say, "That person is radiant."
p70
aVAnd I was thinking, "My gosh, how could we make something
p71
aVarchitectural out of that,
p72
aVwhere you create a building
p73
aVand it becomes alive with light?
p74
aVLike alabaster, if you kiss it with light, it becomes alive.
p75
aVAnd I drew this sketch,
p76
aVsomething with two layers, translucent
p77
aVwith structure in between capturing light.
p78
aVMaybe a pure form, a single form of emanation
p79
aVthat you could imagine
p80
aVwould be all dome
p81
aVand everything we kept making was looking too much like an egg.
p82
aa(lp83
V(Laughter)
p84
aa(lp85
VA blob.
p86
aa(lp87
VSo you search.
p88
aVYou all know this crazy search, letting the process take you,
p89
aVand you live for the surprises.
p90
aVAnd I remember quite by accident
p91
aVI saw this little video of a plant moving in light,
p92
aVand it made me think of movement,
p93
aVreach,
p94
aVthis idea that the temple could have reach,
p95
aVlike this reach for the divine.
p96
aVYou can imagine also
p97
aVthat movement within a circle could mean movement and stillness,
p98
aVlike the cosmos,
p99
aVsomething you see in many places.
p100
aa(lp101
V(Laughter)
p102
aa(lp103
VBut rotation was not enough,
p104
aVbecause we needed a form.
p105
aVIn the Bahá'í writings, it talks about
p106
aVthe temples being as perfect as is humanly possible,
p107
aVand we kept thinking, well, what is perfection?
p108
aVAnd I remember I stumbled into this image of this Japanese basket
p109
aVand thinking our Western notions of perfection need to be challenged,
p110
aVthat this wonderful silhouette of this basket, this wonkiness,
p111
aVand that it has the kind of dimple of what you might imagine a shoulder
p112
aVor the cheekbone,
p113
aVand that kind of organic form.
p114
aVAnd so we drew and made models,
p115
aVthese lines that merge at the top,
p116
aVsoft lines,
p117
aVwhich became like drapery
p118
aVand translucent veils and folding,
p119
aVand the idea of not only folding but torquing \u2014
p120
aVyou remember the plant and the way it was reaching.
p121
aVAnd this started to become an interesting form,
p122
aVcarving the base, making the entrances.
p123
aa(lp124
VAnd then we ended up with this.
p125
aVThis is this temple with two layers,
p126
aVnine luminous veils,
p127
aVembodied light,
p128
aVsoft-flowing lines
p129
aVlike luminescent drapery.
p130
aV180 submissions were received from 80 countries,
p131
aVand this was selected.
p132
aa(lp133
VSo we went to the next stage of how to build it.
p134
aVWe had submitted alabaster.
p135
aVBut alabaster was too soft,
p136
aVand we were experimenting, many experiments with materials,
p137
aVtrying to think how we could have this kind of shimmer,
p138
aVand we ended up with borosilicate.
p139
aVAnd borosilicate glass, as you know, is very strong,
p140
aVand if you break borosilicate rods just so and melt them
p141
aVat just the right temperature,
p142
aVwe ended up with this new material,
p143
aVthis new cast glass which took us about two years to make.
p144
aVAnd it had this quality that we loved,
p145
aVthis idea of the embodied light,
p146
aVbut on the inside, we wanted something with a soft light,
p147
aVlike the inner lining of a jacket.
p148
aVOn the outside you have protection, but on the inside you touch it.
p149
aVSo we found this tiny vein in a huge quarry in Portugal
p150
aVwith this beautiful stone,
p151
aVwhich the owner had kept for seven generations in his family,
p152
aVwaiting for the right project, if you can believe it.
p153
aVLook at this material, it's beautiful.
p154
aVAnd the way it lights up; it has that translucent quality.
p155
aa(lp156
VSo here you see the structure.
p157
aVIt lets the light through.
p158
aVAnd looking down,
p159
aVthe nine wings are bound,
p160
aVstructurally but symbolically strong,
p161
aVa great symbol of unity:
p162
aVpure geometry, a perfect circle,
p163
aV30 meters in section and in plan,
p164
aVperfectly symmetrical,
p165
aVlike the idea of sacredness and geometry.
p166
aVAnd here you see the building going up,
p167
aV2,000 steel nodes,
p168
aV9,000 pieces of steel,
p169
aV7,800 stone pieces,
p170
aV10,000 cast glass pieces, all individual shapes,
p171
aVthe entire superstructure all described,
p172
aVengineered, fabricated with aerospace technology,
p173
aVprefabricated machine to machine,
p174
aVrobotically,
p175
aVa huge team effort, you can imagine,
p176
aVof literally hundreds,
p177
aVand within three percent of our $30 million budget
p178
aVset in 2006.
p179
aa(lp180
V(Applause)
p181
aa(lp182
VNine wings bound together
p183
aVforming a nine-pointed star,
p184
aVand the star shape moving in space,
p185
aVtracking the sun.
p186
aa(lp187
VSo here it is.
p188
aa(lp189
VAudience: Wow!
p190
aa(lp191
V(Applause)
p192
aa(lp193
VHopefully, a befitting response to that beautiful quote,
p194
aV"a prayer answered,"
p195
aVopen in all directions,
p196
aVcapturing the blue light of dawn,
p197
aVtent-like white light of day,
p198
aVthe gold light of the afternoon,
p199
aVand of course, at night, the reversal:
p200
aVsensuous,
p201
aVcatching the light in all kinds of mysterious ways.
p202
aa(lp203
VAnd the site: it's interesting; 14 years ago when we made the submission,
p204
aVwe showed the temple set against the Andes.
p205
aVWe didn't have the Andes as our site,
p206
aVbut after nine years, that's exactly where we ended up,
p207
aVthe lines of the temple set against nothing but pure nature,
p208
aVand you turn around and you get nothing but the city below you,
p209
aVand inside, a view in all directions,
p210
aVradiating gardens
p211
aVfrom each of the alcoves,
p212
aVradiating paths.
p213
aa(lp214
VLast October, the opening ceremonies \u2014
p215
aVa beautiful, sacred event,
p216
aV5,000 people from 80 countries,
p217
aVa continuous river of visitors,
p218
aVindigenous people from all over South America,
p219
aVsome who had never left their villages.
p220
aVAnd of course, that this temple belongs to people,
p221
aVthe collective, of many cultures and walks of life,
p222
aVmany beliefs,
p223
aVand for me, what's most important is what it feels like on the inside;
p224
aVthat it feel intimate,
p225
aVsacred,
p226
aVand that everyone is welcome.
p227
aVAnd if even a few who come
p228
aVhave the same reaction as that security guard,
p229
aVthen it truly would be their temple.
p230
aVAnd I would love that.
p231
aa(lp232
