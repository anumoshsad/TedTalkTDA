V(Video) Nicholas Negroponte:  Can we switch to the video disc,
p4
aVwhich is in play mode?
p5
aa(lp6
VI'm really interested in how you put people and computers together.
p7
aVWe will be using the TV screens or their equivalents
p8
aVfor electronic books of the future.
p9
aV(Music, crosstalk)
p10
aVVery interested in touch-sensitive displays,
p11
aVhigh-tech, high-touch, not having to pick up your fingers to use them.
p12
aVThere is another way where computers
p13
aVtouch people: wearing, physically wearing.
p14
aVSuddenly on September 11th,
p15
aVthe world got bigger.
p16
aa(lp17
VNN: Thank you. (Applause)
p18
aa(lp19
VThank you.
p20
aa(lp21
VWhen I was asked to do this,
p22
aVI was also asked to look at all 14 TED Talks
p23
aVthat I had given,
p24
aVchronologically.
p25
aVThe first one was actually two hours.
p26
aVThe second one was an hour,
p27
aVand then they became half hours,
p28
aVand all I noticed was my bald spot getting bigger.
p29
aV(Laughter)
p30
aVImagine seeing your life, 30 years of it, go by,
p31
aVand it was, to say the least,
p32
aVfor me, quite a shocking experience.
p33
aVSo what I'm going to do in my time
p34
aVis try and share with you what happened
p35
aVduring the 30 years,
p36
aVand then also make a prediction,
p37
aVand then tell you a little bit
p38
aVabout what I'm doing next.
p39
aVAnd I put on a slide
p40
aVwhere TED 1 happened in my life.
p41
aVAnd it's rather important
p42
aVbecause I had done 15 years of research before it,
p43
aVso I had a backlog, so it was easy.
p44
aVIt's not that I was Fidel Castro
p45
aVand I could talk for two hours,
p46
aVor Bucky Fuller.
p47
aVI had 15 years of stuff,
p48
aVand the Media Lab was about to start.
p49
aVSo that was easy.
p50
aa(lp51
VBut there are a couple of things
p52
aVabout that period
p53
aVand about what happened that are
p54
aVreally quite important.
p55
aVOne is that
p56
aVit was a period when computers
p57
aVweren't yet for people.
p58
aVAnd the other thing that sort of happened
p59
aVduring that time is that
p60
aVwe were considered sissy computer scientists.
p61
aVWe weren't considered the real thing.
p62
aVSo what I'm going to show you is, in retrospect,
p63
aVa lot more interesting and a lot more accepted
p64
aVthan it was at the time.
p65
aa(lp66
VSo I'm going to characterize the years
p67
aVand I'm even going to go back
p68
aVto some very early work of mine,
p69
aVand this was the kind of stuff I was doing in the '60s:
p70
aVvery direct manipulation,
p71
aVvery influenced as I studied architecture
p72
aVby the architect Moshe Safdie,
p73
aVand you can see that we even built robotic things
p74
aVthat could build habitat-like structures.
p75
aVAnd this for me was
p76
aVnot yet the Media Lab,
p77
aVbut was the beginning of what I'll call
p78
aVsensory computing,
p79
aVand I pick fingers
p80
aVpartly because everybody thought it was ridiculous.
p81
aVPapers were published
p82
aVabout how stupid it was to use fingers.
p83
aVThree reasons: One was they were low-resolution.
p84
aVThe other is your hand would occlude
p85
aVwhat you wanted to see,
p86
aVand the third, which was the winner,
p87
aVwas that your fingers would get the screen dirty,
p88
aVand hence, fingers would never be
p89
aVa device that you'd use.
p90
aVAnd this was a device we built in the '70s,
p91
aVwhich has never even been picked up.
p92
aVIt's not just touch sensitive,
p93
aVit's pressure sensitive.
p94
aa(lp95
V(Video) Voice: Put a yellow circle there.
p96
aa(lp97
VNN: Later work, and again this was before TED 1 \u2014
p98
aa(lp99
V(Video) Voice: Move that west of the diamond.
p100
aVCreate a large green circle there.
p101
aVMan: Aw, shit.
p102
aa(lp103
VNN: \u2014 was to sort of do interface concurrently,
p104
aVso when you talked and you pointed
p105
aVand you had, if you will,
p106
aVmultiple channels.
p107
aa(lp108
VEntebbe happened.
p109
aV1976, Air France was hijacked,
p110
aVtaken to Entebbe,
p111
aVand the Israelis not only did an extraordinary rescue,
p112
aVthey did it partly because they had practiced
p113
aVon a physical model of the airport,
p114
aVbecause they had built the airport,
p115
aVso they built a model in the desert,
p116
aVand when they arrived at Entebbe,
p117
aVthey knew where to go because they had actually been there.
p118
aVThe U.S. government asked some of us, '76,
p119
aVif we could replicate that computationally,
p120
aVand of course somebody like myself says yes.
p121
aVImmediately, you get a contract,
p122
aVDepartment of Defense,
p123
aVand we built this truck and this rig.
p124
aVWe did sort of a simulation,
p125
aVbecause you had video discs,
p126
aVand again, this is '76.
p127
aVAnd then many years later,
p128
aVyou get this truck,
p129
aVand so you have Google Maps.
p130
aa(lp131
VStill people thought,
p132
aVno, that was not serious computer science,
p133
aVand it was a man named Jerry Wiesner,
p134
aVwho happened to be the president of MIT,
p135
aVwho did think it was computer science.
p136
aVAnd one of the keys for anybody
p137
aVwho wants to start something in life:
p138
aVMake sure your president is part of it.
p139
aVSo when I was doing the Media Lab,
p140
aVit was like having a gorilla in the front seat.
p141
aVIf you were stopped for speeding
p142
aVand the officer looked in the window
p143
aVand saw who was in the passenger seat,
p144
aVthen, "Oh, continue on, sir."
p145
aVAnd so we were able,
p146
aVand this is a cute, actually, device, parenthetically.
p147
aVThis was a lenticular photograph of Jerry Wiesner
p148
aVwhere the only thing that changed in the photograph
p149
aVwere the lips.
p150
aVSo when you oscillated that little piece
p151
aVof lenticular sheet with his photograph,
p152
aVit would be in lip sync
p153
aVwith zero bandwidth.
p154
aVIt was a zero-bandwidth teleconferencing system
p155
aVat the time.
p156
aa(lp157
VSo this was the Media Lab's \u2014
p158
aVthis is what we said we'd do,
p159
aVthat the world of computers, publishing,
p160
aVand so on would come together.
p161
aVAgain, not generally accepted,
p162
aVbut very much part of TED in the early days.
p163
aVAnd this is really where we were headed.
p164
aVAnd that created the Media Lab.
p165
aVOne of the things about age
p166
aVis that I can tell you with great confidence,
p167
aVI've been to the future.
p168
aVI've been there, actually, many times.
p169
aVAnd the reason I say that is,
p170
aVhow many times in my life have I said,
p171
aV"Oh, in 10 years, this will happen,"
p172
aVand then 10 years comes.
p173
aVAnd then you say, "Oh, in five years, this will happen."
p174
aVAnd then five years comes.
p175
aVSo I say this a little bit with having felt
p176
aVthat I'd been there a number of times,
p177
aVand one of the things that is most quoted
p178
aVthat I've ever said
p179
aVis that computing is not about computers,
p180
aVand that didn't quite get enough traction,
p181
aVand then it started to.
p182
aVIt started to because people caught on
p183
aVthat the medium wasn't the message.
p184
aVAnd the reason I show this car
p185
aVin actually a rather ugly slide
p186
aVis just again to tell you the kind of story
p187
aVthat characterized a little bit of my life.
p188
aVThis is a student of mine
p189
aVwho had done a Ph.D. called "Backseat Driver."
p190
aVIt was in the early days of GPS,
p191
aVthe car knew where it was,
p192
aVand it would give audio instructions
p193
aVto the driver, when to turn right,  when to turn left and so on.
p194
aVTurns out, there are a lot of things
p195
aVin those instructions that back in that period
p196
aVwere pretty challenging,
p197
aVlike what does it mean, take the next right?
p198
aVWell, if you're coming up on a street,
p199
aVthe next right's probably the one after,
p200
aVand there are lots of issues,
p201
aVand the student did a wonderful thesis,
p202
aVand the MIT patent office said "Don't patent it.
p203
aVIt'll never be accepted.
p204
aVThe liabilities are too large.
p205
aVThere will be insurance issues.
p206
aVDon't patent it."
p207
aVSo we didn't,
p208
aVbut it shows you how people, again, at times,
p209
aVdon't really look at what's happening.
p210
aa(lp211
VSome work, and I'll just go through these very quickly,
p212
aVa lot of sensory stuff.
p213
aVYou might recognize a young Yo-Yo Ma
p214
aVand tracking his body for playing
p215
aVthe cello or the hypercello.
p216
aVThese fellows literally walked  around like that at the time.
p217
aVIt's now a little bit more discreet
p218
aVand more commonplace.
p219
aa(lp220
VAnd then there are at least three heroes
p221
aVI want to quickly mention.
p222
aVMarvin Minsky, who taught me a lot
p223
aVabout common sense,
p224
aVand I will talk briefly about Muriel Cooper,
p225
aVwho was very important to Ricky Wurman
p226
aVand to TED, and in fact, when she got onstage,
p227
aVshe said, the first thing she said was,
p228
aV"I introduced Ricky to Nicky."
p229
aVAnd nobody calls me Nicky
p230
aVand nobody calls Richard Ricky,
p231
aVso nobody knew who she was talking about.
p232
aVAnd then, of course, Seymour Papert,
p233
aVwho is the person who said,
p234
aV"You can't think about thinking
p235
aVunless you think about thinking about something."
p236
aVAnd that's actually \u2014 you can unpack that later.
p237
aVIt's a pretty profound statement.
p238
aa(lp239
VI'm showing some slides
p240
aVthat were from TED 2,
p241
aVa little silly as slides, perhaps.
p242
aVThen I felt television really was about displays.
p243
aVAgain, now we're past TED 1,
p244
aVbut just around the time of TED 2,
p245
aVand what I'd like to mention here is,
p246
aVeven though you could imagine
p247
aVintelligence in the device,
p248
aVI look today at some of the work
p249
aVbeing done about the Internet of Things,
p250
aVand I think it's kind of tragically pathetic,
p251
aVbecause what has happened is people take
p252
aVthe oven panel and put it on your cell phone,
p253
aVor the door key onto your cell phone,
p254
aVjust taking it and bringing it to you,
p255
aVand in fact that's actually what you don't want.
p256
aVYou want to put a chicken in the oven,
p257
aVand the oven says, "Aha, it's a chicken,"
p258
aVand it cooks the chicken.
p259
aV"Oh, it's cooking the chicken for Nicholas,
p260
aVand he likes it this way and that way."
p261
aVSo the intelligence, instead of being in the device,
p262
aVwe have started today
p263
aVto move it back onto the cell phone
p264
aVor closer to the user,
p265
aVnot a particularly enlightened view
p266
aVof the Internet of Things.
p267
aVTelevision, again, television what I said today,
p268
aVthat was back in 1990,
p269
aVand the television of tomorrow
p270
aVwould look something like that.
p271
aVAgain, people, but they laughed cynically,
p272
aVthey didn't laugh with much appreciation.
p273
aa(lp274
VTelecommunications in the 1990s,
p275
aVGeorge Gilder decided that he would call this diagram
p276
aVthe Negroponte switch.
p277
aVI'm probably much less famous than George,
p278
aVso when he called it the Negroponte switch, it stuck,
p279
aVbut the idea of things that came in the ground
p280
aVwould go in the air and stuff in the air
p281
aVwould go into the ground
p282
aVhas played itself out.
p283
aVThat is the original slide from that year,
p284
aVand it has worked in lockstep obedience.
p285
aa(lp286
VWe started Wired magazine.
p287
aVSome people, I remember we shared
p288
aVthe reception desk periodically,
p289
aVand some parent called up irate that his son
p290
aVhad given up Sports Illustrated
p291
aVto subscribe for Wired,
p292
aVand he said, "Are you some porno magazine or something?"
p293
aVand couldn't understand why his son
p294
aVwould be interested in Wired, at any rate.
p295
aa(lp296
VI will go through this a little quicker.
p297
aVThis is my favorite, 1995,
p298
aVback page of Newsweek magazine.
p299
aVOkay. Read it. (Laughter)
p300
aa(lp301
V["Nicholas Negroponte, director of the MIT Media Lab, predicts that we'll soon buy books and newspapers straight over the Internet. Uh, sure." \u2014Clifford Stoll, Newsweek, 1995]
p302
aa(lp303
VYou must admit that gives you,
p304
aVat least it gives me pleasure
p305
aVwhen somebody says how dead wrong you are.
p306
aa(lp307
V"Being Digital" came out.
p308
aVFor me, it gave me an opportunity
p309
aVto be more in the trade press
p310
aVand get this out to the public,
p311
aVand it also allowed us to build the new Media Lab,
p312
aVwhich if you haven't been to, visit,
p313
aVbecause it's a beautiful piece of architecture
p314
aVaside from being a wonderful place to work.
p315
aVSo these are the things we were saying in those TEDs.
p316
aa(lp317
V[Today, multimedia is a desktop or living room experience, because the apparatus is so clunky. This will change dramatically with small, bright, thin, high-resolution displays. \u2014 1995]
p318
aa(lp319
VWe came to them.
p320
aVI looked forward to it every year.
p321
aVIt was the party that Ricky Wurman never had
p322
aVin the sense that he invited many of his old friends,
p323
aVincluding myself.
p324
aa(lp325
VAnd then something for me changed
p326
aVpretty profoundly.
p327
aVI became more involved with computers and learning
p328
aVand influenced by Seymour,
p329
aVbut particularly looking at learning
p330
aVas something that is best approximated
p331
aVby computer programming.
p332
aVWhen you write a computer program,
p333
aVyou've got to not just list things out
p334
aVand sort of take an algorithm
p335
aVand translate it into a set of instructions,
p336
aVbut when there's a bug, and all programs have bugs,
p337
aVyou've got to de-bug it.
p338
aVYou've got to go in, change it,
p339
aVand then re-execute,
p340
aVand you iterate,
p341
aVand that iteration is really
p342
aVa very, very good approximation of learning.
p343
aa(lp344
VSo that led to my own work with Seymour
p345
aVin places like Cambodia
p346
aVand the starting of One Laptop per Child.
p347
aVEnough TED Talks on One Laptop per Child,
p348
aVso I'll go through it very fast,
p349
aVbut it did give us the chance
p350
aVto do something at a relatively large scale
p351
aVin the area of learning, development and computing.
p352
aVVery few people know that One Laptop per Child
p353
aVwas a $1 billion project,
p354
aVand it was, at least over the seven years I ran it,
p355
aVbut even more important, the World Bank
p356
aVcontributed zero, USAID zero.
p357
aVIt was mostly the countries using their own treasuries,
p358
aVwhich is very interesting,
p359
aVat least to me it was very interesting
p360
aVin terms of what I plan to do next.
p361
aVSo these are the various places it happened.
p362
aa(lp363
VI then tried an experiment,
p364
aVand the experiment happened in Ethiopia.
p365
aVAnd here's the experiment.
p366
aVThe experiment is,
p367
aVcan learning happen where there are no schools.
p368
aVAnd we dropped off tablets
p369
aVwith no instructions
p370
aVand let the children figure it out.
p371
aVAnd in a short period of time,
p372
aVthey not only
p373
aVturned them on and were using 50 apps per child
p374
aVwithin five days,
p375
aVthey were singing "ABC" songs within two weeks,
p376
aVbut they hacked Android within six months.
p377
aVAnd so that seemed sufficiently interesting.
p378
aVThis is perhaps the best picture I have.
p379
aVThe kid on your right
p380
aVhas sort of nominated himself as teacher.
p381
aVLook at the kid on the left, and so on.
p382
aVThere are no adults involved in this at all.
p383
aVSo I said, well can we do this
p384
aVat a larger scale?
p385
aVAnd what is it that's missing?
p386
aVThe kids are giving a press conference at this point,
p387
aVand sort of writing in the dirt.
p388
aVAnd the answer is, what is missing?
p389
aVAnd I'm going to skip over my prediction, actually,
p390
aVbecause I'm running out of time,
p391
aVand here's the question, is what's going to happen?
p392
aa(lp393
VI think the challenge
p394
aVis to connect the last billion people,
p395
aVand connecting the last billion
p396
aVis very different than connecting the next billion,
p397
aVand the reason it's different
p398
aVis that the next billion
p399
aVare sort of low-hanging fruit,
p400
aVbut the last billion are rural.
p401
aVBeing rural and being poor
p402
aVare very different.
p403
aVPoverty tends to be created by our society,
p404
aVand the people in that community are not poor
p405
aVin the same way at all.
p406
aVThey may be primitive,
p407
aVbut the way to approach it and to connect them,
p408
aVthe history of One Laptop per Child,
p409
aVand the experiment in Ethiopia,
p410
aVlead me to believe that we can in fact
p411
aVdo this in a very short period of time.
p412
aa(lp413
VAnd so my plan,
p414
aVand unfortunately I haven't been able
p415
aVto get my partners at this point
p416
aVto let me announce them,
p417
aVbut is to do this with a stationary satellite.
p418
aVThere are many reasons
p419
aVthat stationary satellites aren't the best things,
p420
aVbut there are a lot of reasons why they are,
p421
aVand for two billion dollars,
p422
aVyou can connect a lot more than 100 million people,
p423
aVbut the reason I picked two,
p424
aVand I will leave this as my last slide,
p425
aVis two billion dollars
p426
aVis what we were spending
p427
aVin Afghanistan
p428
aVevery week.
p429
aVSo surely if we can connect
p430
aVAfrica and the last billion people
p431
aVfor numbers like that,
p432
aVwe should be doing it.
p433
aa(lp434
VThank you very much.
p435
aa(lp436
V(Applause)
p437
aa(lp438
VChris Anderson: Stay up there. Stay up there.
p439
aa(lp440
VNN: You're going to give me extra time?
p441
aa(lp442
VCA: No. That was wickedly clever, wickedly clever.
p443
aVYou gamed it beautifully.
p444
aVNicholas, what is your prediction?
p445
aV(Laughter)
p446
aa(lp447
VNN: Thank you for asking.
p448
aVI'll tell you what my prediction is,
p449
aVand my prediction, and this is a prediction,
p450
aVbecause it'll be 30 years. I won't be here.
p451
aVBut one of the things about learning how to read,
p452
aVwe have been doing a lot of consuming
p453
aVof information going through our eyes,
p454
aVand so that may be a very inefficient channel.
p455
aVSo my prediction is that we are  going to ingest information
p456
aVYou're going to swallow a pill and know English.
p457
aVYou're going to swallow a pill and know Shakespeare.
p458
aVAnd the way to do it is through the bloodstream.
p459
aVSo once it's in your bloodstream,
p460
aVit basically goes through it and gets into the brain,
p461
aVand when it knows that it's in the brain
p462
aVin the different pieces,
p463
aVit deposits it in the right places.
p464
aVSo it's ingesting.
p465
aa(lp466
VCA: Have you been hanging out with Ray Kurzweil by any chance?
p467
aa(lp468
VNN: No, but I've been hanging around with Ed Boyden
p469
aVand hanging around with one of the speakers
p470
aVwho is here, Hugh Herr,
p471
aVand there are a number of people.
p472
aVThis isn't quite as far-fetched,
p473
aVso 30 years from now.
p474
aa(lp475
VCA: We will check it out.
p476
aVWe're going to be back and we're going to play this clip 30 years from now,
p477
aVand then all eat the red pill.
p478
aa(lp479
VWell thank you for that.
p480
aa(lp481
VNicholas Negroponte.
p482
aa(lp483
