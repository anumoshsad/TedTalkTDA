VTell your daughters of this year,
p4
aVhow we woke needing coffee
p5
aVbut discovered instead cadavers strewn about our morning papers,
p6
aVwaterlogged facsimiles of our sisters, spouses, small children.
p7
aVSay to your baby of this year when she asks, as she certainly should,
p8
aVtell her it was too late coming.
p9
aVAdmit even in the year we leased freedom, we didn't own it outright.
p10
aVThere were still laws for every way we used our privates
p11
aVwhile they pawed at the soft folds of us,
p12
aVgrabbed with no concern for consent,
p13
aVno laws made for the men that enforced them.
p14
aVWe were trained to dodge,
p15
aVto wait, to cower and cover,
p16
aVto wait more, still, wait.
p17
aVWe were told to be silent.
p18
aa(lp19
VBut speak to your girls of this wartime,
p20
aVa year preceded by a score of the same,
p21
aVso as in two decades before,
p22
aVwe wiped our eyes,
p23
aVlaced caskets with flags,
p24
aVevacuated the crime scene of the club,
p25
aVcaterwauled in the street,
p26
aVlaid our bodies on the concrete against the outlines of our fallen,
p27
aVcried, "Of course we mattered,"
p28
aVchanted for our disappeared.
p29
aVThe women wept this year.
p30
aVThey did.
p31
aa(lp32
VIn the same year, we were ready.
p33
aVThe year we lost our inhibition and moved with courageous abandon
p34
aVwas also the year we stared down barrels,
p35
aVsang of cranes in skies, ducked and parried,
p36
aVcaught gold in hijab, collected death threats,
p37
aVknew ourselves as patriots,
p38
aVsaid, "We're 35 now, time we settled down and found a running mate,"
p39
aVmade road maps for infant joy, shamed nothing but fear,
p40
aVcalled ourselves fat and meant, of course,
p41
aVimpeccable.
p42
aa(lp43
VThis year, we were women,
p44
aVnot brides or trinkets,
p45
aVnot an off-brand gender,
p46
aVnot a concession, but women.
p47
aa(lp48
VInstruct your babies.
p49
aVRemind them that the year has passed to be docile or small.
p50
aVSome of us said for the first time that we were women,
p51
aVtook this oath of solidarity seriously.
p52
aVSome of us bore children and some of us did not,
p53
aVand none of us questioned whether that made us real
p54
aVor appropriate or true.
p55
aa(lp56
VWhen she asks you of this year,
p57
aVyour daughter, whether your offspring or heir to your triumph,
p58
aVfrom her comforted side of history teetering towards woman,
p59
aVshe will wonder and ask voraciously,
p60
aVthough she cannot fathom your sacrifice,
p61
aVshe will hold your estimation of it holy,
p62
aVcuriously probing, "Where were you?
p63
aVDid you fight? Were you fearful or fearsome?
p64
aVWhat colored the walls of your regret?
p65
aVWhat did you do for women in the year it was time?
p66
aVThis path you made for me, which bones had to break?
p67
aVDid you do enough, and are you OK, momma?
p68
aVAnd are you a hero?"
p69
aVShe will ask the difficult questions.
p70
aa(lp71
VShe will not care about the arc of your brow,
p72
aVthe weight of your clutch.
p73
aVShe will not ask of your mentions.
p74
aVYour daughter, for whom you have already carried so much, wants to know
p75
aVwhat you brought, what gift, what light did you keep from extinction?
p76
aVWhen they came for victims in the night,
p77
aVdid you sleep through it or were you roused?
p78
aVWhat was the cost of staying woke?
p79
aVWhat, in the year we said time's up, what did you do with your privilege?
p80
aVDid you sup on others' squalor?
p81
aVDid you look away or directly into the flame?
p82
aVDid you know your skill or treat it like a liability?
p83
aVWere you fooled by the epithets of "nasty" or "less than"?
p84
aVDid you teach with an open heart or a clenched fist?
p85
aVWhere were you?
p86
aa(lp87
VTell her the truth. Make it your life.
p88
aVConfirm it. Say, "Daughter, I stood there
p89
aVwith the moment drawn on my face like a dagger,
p90
aVand flung it back at itself,
p91
aVslicing space for you."
p92
aVTell her the truth, how you lived in spite of crooked odds.
p93
aVTell her you were brave,
p94
aVand always, always in the company of courage,
p95
aVmostly the days when you just had yourself.
p96
aVTell her she was born as you were,
p97
aVas your mothers before, and the sisters beside them,
p98
aVin the age of legends, like always.
p99
aa(lp100
VTell her she was born just in time,
p101
aVjust in time
p102
aVto lead.
