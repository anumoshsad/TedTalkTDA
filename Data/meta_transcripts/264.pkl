VThe first question is this.
p4
aVOur country has two exploration programs.
p5
aVOne is NASA, with a mission to explore the great beyond,
p6
aVto explore the heavens, which we all want to go to if we're lucky.
p7
aVAnd you can see we have Sputnik, and we have Saturn,
p8
aVand we have other manifestations of space exploration.
p9
aVWell, there's also another program,
p10
aVin another agency within our government, in ocean exploration.
p11
aVIt's in NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
p12
aVAnd my question is this: "why are we ignoring the oceans?"
p13
aVHere's the reason, or not the reason, but here's why I ask that question.
p14
aVIf you compare NASA's annual budget to explore the heavens,
p15
aVthat one-year budget would fund NOAA's budget
p16
aVto explore the oceans for 1,600 years.
p17
aVWhy? Why are we looking up? Is it because it's heaven?
p18
aVAnd hell is down here? Is it a cultural issue?
p19
aVWhy are people afraid of the ocean?
p20
aVOr do they just assume the ocean is just a dark, gloomy place
p21
aVthat has nothing to offer?
p22
aa(lp23
VI'm going to take you on a 16-minute trip on 72 percent of the planet, so buckle up.
p24
aVOK. And what we're going to do
p25
aVis we're going to immerse ourselves in my world.
p26
aVAnd what I'm going to try \u2014 I hope I make the following points.
p27
aVI'm going to make it right now in case I forget.
p28
aVEverything I'm going to present to you
p29
aVwas not in my textbooks when I went to school.
p30
aVAnd most of all, it was not even in my college textbooks.
p31
aVI'm a geophysicist, and all my Earth science books when I was a student \u2014
p32
aVI had to give the wrong answer to get an A.
p33
aVWe used to ridicule continental drift. It was something we laughed at.
p34
aVWe learned of Marshall Kay's geosynclinal cycle, which is a bunch of crap.
p35
aVIn today's context, it was a bunch of crap,
p36
aVbut it was the law of geology, vertical tectonics.
p37
aVAll the things we're going to walk through
p38
aVin our explorations and discoveries of the oceans
p39
aVwere mostly discoveries made by accident.
p40
aVMostly discoveries made by accident.
p41
aVWe were looking for something and found something else.
p42
aVAnd everything we're going to talk about
p43
aVrepresents a one tenth of one percent glimpse, because that's all we've seen.
p44
aa(lp45
VI have a characterization.
p46
aVThis is a characterization of what it would look like if you could remove the water.
p47
aVIt gives you the false impression it's a map.
p48
aVIt is not a map.
p49
aVIn fact, I have another version at my office
p50
aVand I ask people, "Why are there mountains here, on this area here,
p51
aVbut there are none over here?" And they go, "Well, gee,
p52
aVI don't know," saying,
p53
aV"Is it a fracture zone? Is it a hot spot?"
p54
aVNo, no, that's the only place a ship's been.
p55
aVMost of the southern hemisphere is unexplored.
p56
aVWe had more exploration ships down there
p57
aVduring Captain Cook's time than now. It's amazing.
p58
aVAll right. So we're going to immerse ourselves
p59
aVin the 72 percent of the planet because, you know,
p60
aVit's really naive to think that the Easter Bunny
p61
aVput all the resources on the continents.
p62
aa(lp63
V(Laughter)
p64
aa(lp65
VYou know, it's just ludicrous.
p66
aVWe are always, constantly playing the zero sum game.
p67
aVYou know, we're going to do this, we're going to take it away from something else.
p68
aVI believe in just enriching the economy.
p69
aVAnd we're leaving so much on the table, 72 percent of the planet.
p70
aVAnd as I will point out later in the presentation,
p71
aV50 percent of the United States of America lies beneath the sea.
p72
aV50 percent of our country that we own, have all legal jurisdiction,
p73
aVhave all rights to do whatever we want, lies beneath the sea
p74
aVand we have better maps of Mars than that 50 percent.
p75
aVWhy? OK. Now, I began my explorations the hard way.
p76
aVBack then \u2014 actually my first expedition
p77
aVwas when I was 17 years old. It was 49 years ago.
p78
aVDo the math, I'm 66. And I went out to sea on a Scripps ship
p79
aVand we almost got sunk by a giant rogue wave,
p80
aVand I was too young to be \u2014 you know, I thought it was great!
p81
aVI was a body surfer and I thought, "Wow, that was an incredible wave!"
p82
aVAnd we almost sank the ship, but I became enraptured
p83
aVwith mounting expeditions. And over the last 49 years,
p84
aVI've done about 120, 121 \u2014 I keep doing them \u2014 expeditions.
p85
aa(lp86
VBut in the early days, the only way I could get to the bottom
p87
aVwas to crawl into a submarine, a very small submarine,
p88
aVand go down to the bottom.
p89
aVI dove in a whole series of different deep diving submersibles.
p90
aVAlvin and Sea Cliff and Cyana,
p91
aVand all the major deep submersibles we have, which are about eight.
p92
aVIn fact, on a good day, we might have four or five human beings
p93
aVat the average depth of the Earth \u2014
p94
aVmaybe four or five human beings out of whatever billions we've got going.
p95
aVAnd so it's very difficult to get there, if you do it physically.
p96
aVBut I was enraptured, and in my graduate years
p97
aVwas the dawn of plate tectonics. And we realized
p98
aVthat the greatest mountain range on Earth lies beneath the sea.
p99
aa(lp100
VThe mid-ocean ridge runs around like the seam on a baseball.
p101
aVThis is on a Mercator projection.
p102
aVBut if you were to put it on an equal area projection,
p103
aVyou'd see that the mid-ocean ridge covers 23 percent
p104
aVof the Earth's total surface area.
p105
aVAlmost a quarter of our planet is a single mountain range
p106
aVand we didn't enter it until after Neil Armstrong
p107
aVand Buzz Aldrin went to the moon.
p108
aVSo we went to the moon, played golf up there,
p109
aVbefore we went to the largest feature on our own planet.
p110
aVAnd our interest in this mountain range, as Earth scientists in those days,
p111
aVwas not only because of its tremendous size, dominating the planet,
p112
aVbut the role it plays in the genesis of the Earth's outer skin.
p113
aVBecause it's along the axis of the mid-ocean ridge
p114
aVwhere the great crustal plates are separating.
p115
aVAnd like a living organism, you tear it open,
p116
aVit bleeds its molten blood, rises up to heal that wound
p117
aVfrom the asthenosphere, hardens, forms new tissue and moves laterally.
p118
aa(lp119
VBut no one had actually gone down
p120
aVinto the actual site of the boundary of creation as we call it \u2014
p121
aVinto the Rift Valley \u2014 until a group of seven of us
p122
aVcrawled in our little submarines in the summer of 1973, 1974
p123
aVand were the first human beings to enter the Great Rift Valley.
p124
aVWe went down into the Rift Valley.
p125
aVThis is all accurate except for one thing \u2014 it's pitch black.
p126
aVIt's absolutely pitch black, because
p127
aVphotons cannot reach the average depth of the ocean,
p128
aVwhich is 12,000 feet. In the Rift Valley, it's 9,000 feet.
p129
aVMost of our planet does not feel the warmth of the sun.
p130
aVMost of our planet is in eternal darkness.
p131
aVAnd for that reason, you do not have photosynthesis in the deep sea.
p132
aVAnd with the absence of photosynthesis
p133
aVyou have no plant life, and as a result,
p134
aVyou have very little animal life living in this underworld.
p135
aVOr so we thought. And so in our initial explorations,
p136
aVwe were totally focused on exploring the boundary of creation,
p137
aVlooking at the volcanic features running along that entire 42,000 miles.
p138
aVRunning along this entire 42,000 miles
p139
aVare tens of thousands of active volcanoes.
p140
aVTens of thousands of active volcanoes.
p141
aVThere are more active volcanoes beneath the sea
p142
aVthan on land by two orders of magnitude.
p143
aVSo, it's a phenomenally active region,
p144
aVit's not just a dark, boring place. It's a very alive place.
p145
aVAnd it's then being ripped open.
p146
aa(lp147
VBut we were dealing with a particular scientific issue back then.
p148
aVWe couldn't understand why you had a mountain under tension.
p149
aVIn plate tectonic theory, we knew that if you had plates collide,
p150
aVit made sense: they would crush into one another,
p151
aVyou would thicken the crust, you'd uplift it.
p152
aVThat's why you get, you know, you get seashells up on Mount Everest.
p153
aVIt's not a flood, it was pushed up there.
p154
aVWe understood mountains under compression,
p155
aVbut we could not understand why we had a mountain under tension.
p156
aVIt should not be. Until one of my colleagues said,
p157
aV"It looks to me like a thermal blister, and the mid-ocean ridge
p158
aVmust be a cooling curve." We said, "Let's go find out."
p159
aVWe punched a bunch of heat probes. Everything made sense,
p160
aVexcept, at the axis, there was missing heat. It was missing heat.
p161
aVIt was hot. It wasn't hot enough.
p162
aVSo, we came up with multiple hypotheses:
p163
aVthere's little green people down there taking it;
p164
aVthere's all sorts of things going on.
p165
aVBut the only logical [explanation] was that there were hot springs.
p166
aVSo, there must be underwater hot springs.
p167
aa(lp168
VWe mounted an expedition to look for the missing heat.
p169
aVAnd so we went along this mountain range, in an area along Galapagos Rift,
p170
aVand did we find the missing heat.
p171
aVIt was amazing. These giant chimneys, huge giant chimneys.
p172
aVWe went up to them with our submersible.
p173
aVWe wanted to get a temperature probe, we stuck it in there,
p174
aVlooked at it \u2014 it pegged off scale.
p175
aVThe pilot made this great observation: "That's hot."
p176
aa(lp177
V(Laughter)
p178
aa(lp179
VAnd then we realized our probe was made out of the same stuff \u2014
p180
aVit could have melted. But it turns out the exiting temperature
p181
aVwas 650 degrees F, hot enough to melt lead.
p182
aVThis is what a real one looks like, on the Juan de Fuca Ridge.
p183
aVWhat you're looking at is an incredible pipe organ
p184
aVof chemicals coming out of the ocean.
p185
aVEverything you see in this picture is commercial grade:
p186
aVcopper, lead, silver, zinc and gold.
p187
aVSo the Easter Bunny has put things in the ocean floor,
p188
aVand you have massive heavy metal deposits
p189
aVthat we're making in this mountain range.
p190
aVWe're making huge discoveries of large commercial-grade ore
p191
aValong this mountain range, but it was dwarfed by what we discovered.
p192
aVWe discovered a profusion of life,
p193
aVin a world that it should not exist [in]. Giant tube worms, 10 feet tall.
p194
aVI remember having to use vodka \u2014 my own vodka \u2014 to pickle it
p195
aVbecause we don't carry formaldehyde.
p196
aVWe went and found these incredible clam beds
p197
aVsitting on the barren rock. Large clams,
p198
aVand when we opened them, they didn't look like a clam.
p199
aVAnd when we cut them open, they didn't have the anatomy of a clam.
p200
aVNo mouth, no gut, no digestive system.
p201
aVTheir bodies had been totally taken over
p202
aVby another organism, a bacterium, that had figured out
p203
aVhow to replicate photosynthesis in the dark,
p204
aVthrough a process we now call chemosynthesis.
p205
aVNone of it in our textbooks. None of this in our textbooks.
p206
aVWe did not know about this life system.
p207
aVWe were not predicting it.
p208
aVWe stumbled on it, looking for some missing heat.
p209
aa(lp210
VSo, we wanted to accelerate this process.
p211
aVWe wanted to get away from this silly trip, up and down on a submarine:
p212
aVaverage depth of the ocean, 12,000 feet;
p213
aVtwo and half hours to get to work in the morning;
p214
aVtwo and half hours to get to home. Five hour commute to work.
p215
aVThree hours of bottom time, average distance traveled \u2014 one mile.
p216
aa(lp217
V(Laughter)
p218
aa(lp219
VOn a 42,000 mile mountain range. Great job security, but not the way to go.
p220
aVSo, I began designing a new technology of telepresence,
p221
aVusing robotic systems to replicate myself,
p222
aVso I wouldn't have to cycle my vehicle system.
p223
aVWe began to introduce that in our explorations,
p224
aVand we continued to make phenomenal discoveries
p225
aVwith our new robotic technologies. Again, looking for something else,
p226
aVmoving from one part of the mid-ocean ridge to another.
p227
aVThe scientists were off watch and they came across incredible life forms.
p228
aVThey came across new creatures they had not seen before.
p229
aVBut more importantly, they discovered
p230
aVedifices down there that they did not understand.
p231
aVThat did not make sense. They were not above a magma chamber.
p232
aVThey shouldn't be there. And we called it Lost City.
p233
aa(lp234
VAnd Lost City was characterized by these incredible limestone formations
p235
aVand upside down pools. Look at that.
p236
aVHow do you do that? That's water upside down.
p237
aVWe went in underneath and tapped it, and we found that it had the pH of Drano.
p238
aVThe pH of 11, and yet it had chemosynthetic bacteria living in it
p239
aVand at this extreme environment.
p240
aVAnd the hydrothermal vents were in an acidic environment.
p241
aVAll the way at the other end, in an alkaline environment,
p242
aVat a pH of 11, life existed.
p243
aVSo life was much more creative than we had ever thought.
p244
aVAgain, discovered by accident. Just two years ago
p245
aVworking off Santorini, where people are sunning themselves on the beach,
p246
aVunbeknownst to them in the caldera nearby,
p247
aVwe found phenomenal hydrothermal vent systems
p248
aVand more life systems.
p249
aVThis was two miles from where people go to sunbathe,
p250
aVand they were oblivious to the existence of this system.
p251
aVAgain, you know, we stop at the water's edge.
p252
aa(lp253
VRecently, diving off \u2014 in the Gulf of Mexico, finding pools of water,
p254
aVthis time not upside down, right side up.
p255
aVBingo. You'd think you're in air, until a fish swims by.
p256
aVYou're looking at brine pools formed by salt diapirs.
p257
aVNear that was methane. I've never seen volcanoes of methane.
p258
aVInstead of belching out lava, they were belching out
p259
aVbig, big bubbles of methane. And they were creating these volcanoes,
p260
aVand there were flows, not of lava,
p261
aVbut of the mud coming out of the Earth but driven by \u2014
p262
aVI've never seen this before.
p263
aa(lp264
VMoving on, there's more than just natural history beneath the sea \u2014
p265
aVhuman history. Our discoveries of the Titanic.
p266
aVThe realization that the deep sea is the largest museum on Earth.
p267
aVIt contains more history than all of the museums on land combined.
p268
aVAnd yet we're only now penetrating it.
p269
aVFinding the state of preservation.
p270
aVWe found the Bismarck in 16,000 feet. We then found the Yorktown.
p271
aVPeople always ask, "Did you find the right ship?"
p272
aVIt said Yorktown on the stern.
p273
aa(lp274
V(Laughter)
p275
aa(lp276
VMore recently, finding ancient history.
p277
aVHow many ancient mariners have had a bad day? The number's a million.
p278
aVWe've been discovering these along ancient trade routes,
p279
aVwhere they're not supposed to be.
p280
aVThis shipwreck sank 100 years before the birth of Christ.
p281
aVThis one sank carrying a prefabricated, Home Depot Roman temple.
p282
aVAnd then here's one that sank at the time of Homer, at 750 B.C.
p283
aVMore recently, into the Black Sea, where we're exploring.
p284
aVBecause there's no oxygen there, it's the largest reservoir
p285
aVof hydrogen sulfide on Earth. Shipwrecks are perfectly preserved.
p286
aVAll their organics are perfectly preserved. We begin to excavate them.
p287
aVWe expect to start hauling out the bodies in perfect condition with their DNA.
p288
aVLook at the state of preservation \u2014
p289
aVstill the ad mark of a carpenter. Look at the state of those artifacts.
p290
aVYou still see the beeswax dripping. When they dropped, they sealed it.
p291
aVThis ship sank 1,500 years ago.
p292
aa(lp293
VFortunately, we've been able to convince Congress.
p294
aVWe begin to go on the Hill and lobby.
p295
aVAnd we stole recently a ship from the United States Navy.
p296
aVThe Okeanos Explorer on its mission.
p297
aVIts mission is as good as you could get.
p298
aVIts mission is to go where no one has gone before on planet Earth.
p299
aVAnd I was looking at it yesterday, it's up in Seattle. OK.
p300
aa(lp301
V(Applause)
p302
aa(lp303
VIt comes online this summer,
p304
aVand it begins its journey of exploration.
p305
aVBut we have no idea what we're going find when we go out there with our technology.
p306
aVBut certainly, it's going to be going to the unknown America.
p307
aVThis is that part of the United States that lies beneath the sea.
p308
aVWe own all of that blue and yet,
p309
aVlike I say, particularly the western territorial trust,
p310
aVwe don't have maps of them. We don't have maps of them.
p311
aVWe have maps of Venus, but not of the western territorial trust.
p312
aVThe way we're going to run this \u2014 we have no idea what we're going to discover.
p313
aVWe have no idea what we're going to discover.
p314
aVWe're going to discover an ancient shipwreck, a Phoenician off Brazil,
p315
aVor a new rock formation, a new life.
p316
aVSo, we're going to run it like an emergency hospital.
p317
aa(lp318
VWe're going to connect our command center,
p319
aVvia a high-bandwidth satellite link to a building we're building
p320
aVat the University of Rhode Island, called the Interspace Center.
p321
aVAnd within that, we're going to run it just like you run a nuclear submarine,
p322
aVblue-gold team, switching them off and on, running 24 hours a day.
p323
aVA discovery is made, that discovery is instantly seen
p324
aVin the command center a second later.
p325
aVBut then it's connected through Internet too \u2014
p326
aVthe new Internet highway that makes Internet one
p327
aVlook like a dirt road on the information highway \u2014
p328
aVwith 10 gigabits of bandwidth.
p329
aVWe'll go into areas we have no knowledge of.
p330
aVIt's a big blank sheet on our planet. We'll map it within hours,
p331
aVhave the maps disseminated out to the major universities.
p332
aVIt turns out that 90 percent of all the oceanographic intellect
p333
aVin this country are at 12 universities. They're all on I-2.
p334
aVWe can then build a command center.
p335
aVThis is a remote center at the University of Washington.
p336
aVShe's talking to the pilot. She's 5,000 miles away, but she's assumed command.
p337
aa(lp338
VBut the beauty of this, too, is we can then disseminate it to children.
p339
aVWe can disseminate.
p340
aVThey can follow this expedition. I've started a program \u2014
p341
aVwhere are you Jim? Jim Young who helped me start a program
p342
aVcalled the Jason Project. More recently, we've started a program
p343
aVwith the Boys and Girls Clubs of America,
p344
aVso that we can use exploration,
p345
aVand the excitement of live exploration, to motivate them and excite them
p346
aVand then give them what they're already ready for.
p347
aVI would not let an adult drive my robot.
p348
aVYou don't have enough gaming experience.
p349
aVBut I will let a kid with no license take over control of my vehicle system.
p350
aa(lp351
V(Applause)
p352
aa(lp353
VBecause we want to create \u2014
p354
aVwe want to create the classroom of tomorrow.
p355
aVWe have stiff competition and we need to motivate and it's all being done.
p356
aVYou win or lose an engineer or a scientist by eighth grade.
p357
aVThe game is not over \u2014 it's over by the eighth grade, it's not beginning.
p358
aVWe need to be not only proud of our universities.
p359
aVWe need to be proud of our middle schools.
p360
aVAnd when we have the best middle schools in the world,
p361
aVwe'll have the best kids pumped out of that system, let me tell you.
p362
aVBecause this is what we want. This is what we want.
p363
aVThis is a young lady, not watching a football game,
p364
aVnot watching a basketball game.
p365
aVWatching exploration live from thousands of miles away,
p366
aVand it's just dawning on her what she's seeing.
p367
aVAnd when you get a jaw drop, you can inform.
p368
aVYou can put so much information into that mind, it's in full [receiving] mode.
p369
aa(lp370
V(Applause)
p371
aa(lp372
VThis, I hope, will be a future engineer
p373
aVor a future scientist in the battle for truth.
p374
aVAnd my final question, my final question \u2014
p375
aVwhy are we not looking at moving out onto the sea?
p376
aVWhy do we have programs to build habitation on Mars,
p377
aVand we have programs to look at colonizing the moon,
p378
aVbut we do not have a program looking at how we colonize our own planet?
p379
aVAnd the technology is at hand.
p380
