VI am a PhD student.
p4
aVAnd that means I have a question:
p5
aVHow can we make digital content graspable?
p6
aVBecause you see, on the one hand, there is the digital world
p7
aVand no question, many things are happening there right now.
p8
aVAnd for us humans, it's not quite material, it's not really there \u2014
p9
aVit's virtual.
p10
aVOn the other hand,
p11
aVwe're humans, we live in a physical world.
p12
aVIt's rich, it tastes good, it feels good, it smells good.
p13
aVSo the question is:
p14
aVHow do we get the stuff over from the digital into the physical?
p15
aVThat's my question.
p16
aa(lp17
VIf you look at the iPhone with its touch
p18
aVand the Wii with its bodily activity,
p19
aVyou can see the tendency; it's getting physical.
p20
aVThe question is: What's next?
p21
aVNow, I have three options that I would like to show you.
p22
aa(lp23
VThe first one is mass.
p24
aVAs humans, we are sensitive to where an object in our hand is heavy.
p25
aVSo could we use that in mobile phones?
p26
aVLet me show you the weight-shifting mobile.
p27
aVIt is a mobile phone-shaped box
p28
aVthat has an iron weight inside, which we can move around,
p29
aVand you can feel where it's heavy.
p30
aVWe shift the gravitational center of it.
p31
aVFor example, we can augment digital content with physical mass.
p32
aVSo you move around the content on the display,
p33
aVbut you can also feel where it is just from the weight of the device.
p34
aa(lp35
VAnother thing it's good for is navigation.
p36
aVIt can guide you around in a city.
p37
aVIt can tell you by its weight,
p38
aV"OK, move right. Walk ahead. Make a left here."
p39
aVAnd the good thing about that is,
p40
aVyou don't have to look at the device all the time;
p41
aVyou have your eyes free to see the city.
p42
aa(lp43
VNow, mass is the first thing \u2014
p44
aVthe second thing, that's shape.
p45
aVWe're also sensitive to the shape of objects we have in our hands.
p46
aVSo if I download an e-book and it has 20 pages \u2014
p47
aVwell, they could be thin, right?
p48
aVBut if it has 500 pages, I want to feel that "Harry Potter" \u2014
p49
aVit's thick.
p50
aa(lp51
V(Laughter)
p52
aa(lp53
VSo let me show you the shape-changing mobile.
p54
aVAgain, it's a mobile phone-shaped box,
p55
aVand this one can change its shape.
p56
aVWe can play with the shape itself.
p57
aVFor example, it can be thin in your pocket,
p58
aVwhich we of course want it to be.
p59
aVBut then if you hold it in your hand, it can lean towards you, be thick.
p60
aVIt's like tapered to the downside.
p61
aVIf you change the grasp, it can adjust to that.
p62
aVIt's also useful if you want to put it down on your nightstand
p63
aVto watch a movie or use as an alarm clock.
p64
aVIt stands.
p65
aVIt's fairly simple.
p66
aa(lp67
VAnother thing is,
p68
aVsometimes we watch things on a mobile phone
p69
aVthat are bigger than the phone itself.
p70
aVIn that case \u2014 like here, there's an app
p71
aVthat's bigger than the phone's screen \u2014
p72
aVthe shape of the phone could tell you,
p73
aV"OK, off the screen, right here, there is more content.
p74
aVYou can't see it, but it's there."
p75
aVAnd you can feel it, because it's thicker at that edge.
p76
aa(lp77
VThe shape is the second thing.
p78
aVThe third thing operates on a different level.
p79
aVAs humans, we are social, we are empathic,
p80
aVand that's great.
p81
aVWouldn't that be a way to make mobile phones more intuitive?
p82
aVThink of a hamster in the pocket.
p83
aVWell, I can feel it, it's doing all right. I don't have to check it.
p84
aa(lp85
V(Laughter)
p86
aa(lp87
VLet me show you the living mobile phone.
p88
aVSo, once again, a mobile phone-shaped box.
p89
aVBut this one, it has a breath and a heartbeat,
p90
aVand it feels very organic.
p91
aa(lp92
V(Laughter)
p93
aa(lp94
VAnd you can tell, it's relaxed right now.
p95
aVOh, now \u2014 missed call, a new call,
p96
aVnew girlfriend, maybe \u2014 very exciting.
p97
aa(lp98
V(Laughter)
p99
aa(lp100
VHow do we calm it down?
p101
aVYou give it a pat behind the ears,
p102
aVand everything is all right again.
p103
aVThat's very intuitive, and that's what we want.
p104
aVSo what we have seen are three ways to make the digital graspable for us.
p105
aVAnd I think making it physical is a good way to do that.
p106
aVWhat's behind that is a postulation,
p107
aVnamely, not that humans should get much more technical in the future;
p108
aVrather than that, technology, a bit more human.
