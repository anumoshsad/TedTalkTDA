VJohn Hockenberry: It's great to be here with you, Tom.
p4
aVAnd I want to start with a question
p5
aVthat has just been consuming me
p6
aVsince I first became familiar with your work.
p7
aVIn you work there's always this kind of hybrid quality
p8
aVof a natural force
p9
aVin some sort of interplay with creative force.
p10
aVAre they ever in equilibrium
p11
aVin the way that you see your work?
p12
aa(lp13
VTom Shannon: Yeah, the subject matter that I'm looking for,
p14
aVit's usually to solve a question.
p15
aVI had the question popped into my head:
p16
aVWhat does the cone that connects the sun and the Earth look like
p17
aVif you could connect the two spheres?
p18
aVAnd in proportion, what would the size of the sphere
p19
aVand the length, and what would the taper be to the Earth?
p20
aVAnd so I went about and made that sculpture,
p21
aVturning it out of solid bronze.
p22
aVAnd I did one that was about 35 feet long.
p23
aVThe sun end was about four inches in diameter,
p24
aVand then it tapered over about 35 feet
p25
aVto about a millimeter at the Earth end.
p26
aVAnd so for me, it was really exciting
p27
aVjust to see what it looks like
p28
aVif you could step outside and into a larger context,
p29
aVas though you were an astronaut,
p30
aVand see these two things as an object,
p31
aVbecause they are so intimately bound,
p32
aVand one is meaningless without the other.
p33
aa(lp34
VJH: Is there a relief
p35
aVin playing with these forces?
p36
aVAnd I'm wondering how much of a sense of discovery there is
p37
aVin playing with these forces.
p38
aa(lp39
VTS: Well, like the magnetically levitated objects \u2014
p40
aVlike that silver one there,
p41
aVthat was the result
p42
aVof hundreds of experiments with magnets,
p43
aVtrying to find a way to make something float
p44
aVwith the least possible connection to the ground.
p45
aVSo I got it down to just one tether
p46
aVto be able to support that.
p47
aa(lp48
VJH: Now is this electromagnetic here, or are these static?
p49
aa(lp50
VTS: Those are permanent magnets, yeah.
p51
aa(lp52
VJH: Because if the power went out, there would just be a big noise.
p53
aa(lp54
VTS: Yeah.
p55
aVIt's really unsatisfactory having plug-in art.
p56
aa(lp57
VJH: I agree.
p58
aa(lp59
VTS: The magnetic works
p60
aVare a combination of gravity and magnetism,
p61
aVso it's a kind of mixture of these ambient forces
p62
aVthat influence everything.
p63
aVThe sun has a tremendous field
p64
aVthat extends way beyond the planets
p65
aVand the Earth's magnetic field protects us from the sun.
p66
aVSo there's this huge
p67
aVinvisible shape structures
p68
aVthat magnetism takes in the universe.
p69
aVBut with the pendulum,
p70
aVit allows me to manifest
p71
aVthese invisible forces
p72
aVthat are holding the magnets up.
p73
aVMy sculptures
p74
aVare normally very simplified.
p75
aVI try to refine them down
p76
aVto very simple forms.
p77
aVBut the paintings become very complex,
p78
aVbecause I think the fields
p79
aVthat are supporting them,
p80
aVthey're billowing, and they're interpenetrating,
p81
aVand they're interference patterns.
p82
aa(lp83
VJH: And they're non-deterministic.
p84
aVI mean, you don't know necessarily where you're headed when you begin,
p85
aVeven though the forces can be calculated.
p86
aVSo the evolution of this \u2014
p87
aVI gather this isn't your first pendulum.
p88
aa(lp89
VTS: No. (JH: No.)
p90
aa(lp91
VTS: The first one I did was in the late 70's,
p92
aVand I just had a simple cone
p93
aVwith a spigot at the bottom of it.
p94
aVI threw it into an orbit,
p95
aVand it only had one color,
p96
aVand when it got to the center, the paint kept running out,
p97
aVso I had to run in there,
p98
aVdidn't have any control over the spigot remotely.
p99
aVSo that told me right away: I need a remote control device.
p100
aVBut then I started dreaming of having six colors.
p101
aVI sort of think about it as the DNA \u2014
p102
aVthese colors, the red, blue, yellow,
p103
aVthe primary colors and white and black.
p104
aVAnd if you put them together in different combinations \u2014
p105
aVjust like printing in a sense,
p106
aVlike how a magazine color is printed \u2014
p107
aVand put them under certain forces,
p108
aVwhich is orbiting them
p109
aVor passing them back and forth
p110
aVor drawing with them,
p111
aVthese amazing things started appearing.
p112
aa(lp113
VJH: It looks like we're loaded for bear here.
p114
aa(lp115
VTS: Yeah, well let's put a couple of canvases.
p116
aVI'll ask a couple of my sons
p117
aVto set up the canvases here.
p118
aVI want to just say \u2014
p119
aVso this is Jack, Nick and Louie.
p120
aa(lp121
VJH: Thanks guys.
p122
aa(lp123
VTS: So here are the \u2014
p124
aa(lp125
VJH: All right, I'll get out of the way here.
p126
aa(lp127
VTS: I'm just going to throw this into an orbit
p128
aVand see if I can paint everybody's shoes in the front.
p129
aa(lp130
V(Laughter)
p131
aa(lp132
VJH: Whoa. That is ...
p133
aVooh, nice.
p134
aa(lp135
VTS: So something like this.
p136
aVI'm doing this as a demo,
p137
aVand it's more playful,
p138
aVbut inevitably,
p139
aVall of this can be used.
p140
aVI can redeem this painting,
p141
aVjust continuing on,
p142
aVdoing layers upon layers.
p143
aVAnd I keep it around for a couple of weeks,
p144
aVand I'm contemplating it,
p145
aVand I'll do another session with it
p146
aVand bring it up to another level,
p147
aVwhere all of this
p148
aVbecomes the background, the depth of it.
p149
aa(lp150
VJH: That's fantastic.
p151
aVSo the valves at the bottom of those tubes there
p152
aVare like radio-controlled airplane valves.
p153
aa(lp154
VTS: Yes, they're servos with cams
p155
aVthat pinch these rubber tubes.
p156
aVAnd they can pinch them very tight and stop it,
p157
aVor you can have them wide open.
p158
aVAnd all of the colors
p159
aVcome out one central port
p160
aVat the bottom.
p161
aVYou can always be changing colors, put aluminum paint,
p162
aVor I could put anything into this.
p163
aVIt could be tomato sauce,
p164
aVor anything could be dispensed \u2014
p165
aVsand, powders or anything like that.
p166
aa(lp167
VJH: So many forces there.
p168
aVYou've got gravity, you've got the centrifugal force,
p169
aVyou've got the fluid dynamics.
p170
aVEach of these beautiful paintings,
p171
aVare they images in and of themselves,
p172
aVor are they records
p173
aVof a physical event
p174
aVcalled the pendulum approaching the canvas?
p175
aa(lp176
VTS: Well, this painting here,
p177
aVI wanted to do something very simple,
p178
aVa simple, iconic image
p179
aVof two ripples interfering.
p180
aVSo the one on the right was done first,
p181
aVand then the one on the left
p182
aVwas done over it.
p183
aVAnd then I left gaps
p184
aVso you could see the one that was done before.
p185
aVAnd then when I did the second one,
p186
aVit really disturbed the piece \u2014
p187
aVthese big blue lines
p188
aVcrashing through the center of it \u2014
p189
aVand so it created a kind of tension and an overlap.
p190
aVThere are lines in front of the one on the right,
p191
aVand there are lines behind the one on the left,
p192
aVand so it takes it into different planes.
p193
aVWhat it's also about,
p194
aVjust the little events,
p195
aVthe events of the interpenetration of \u2014
p196
aa(lp197
VJH: Two stars, or \u2014
p198
aa(lp199
VTS: Two things that happened \u2014
p200
aVthere's an interference pattern, and then a third thing happens.
p201
aVThere are shapes that come about
p202
aVjust by the marriage
p203
aVof two events that are happening,
p204
aVand I'm very interested in that.
p205
aVLike the occurrence of moire patterns.
p206
aVLike this green one,
p207
aVthis is a painting I did about 10 years ago,
p208
aVbut it has some \u2014
p209
aVsee, in the upper third \u2014
p210
aVthere are these moires and interference patterns
p211
aVthat are radio kind of imagery.
p212
aVAnd that's something that in painting
p213
aVI've never seen done.
p214
aVI've never seen a representation
p215
aVof a kind of radio interference patterns,
p216
aVwhich are so ubiquitous
p217
aVand such an important part of our lives.
p218
aa(lp219
VJH: Is that a literal part of the image,
p220
aVor is my eye making that interference pattern \u2014
p221
aVis my eye completing that interference pattern?
p222
aa(lp223
VTS: It is the paint actually,
p224
aVmakes it real.
p225
aVIt's really manifested there.
p226
aVIf I throw a very concentric circle,
p227
aVor concentric ellipse,
p228
aVit just dutifully makes
p229
aVthese evenly spaced lines,
p230
aVwhich get closer and closer together,
p231
aVwhich describes how gravity works.
p232
aVThere's something very appealing
p233
aVabout the exactitude of science
p234
aVthat I really enjoy.
p235
aVAnd I love the shapes that I see
p236
aVin scientific observations
p237
aVand apparatus,
p238
aVespecially astronomical forms
p239
aVand the idea of the vastness of it,
p240
aVthe scale,
p241
aVis very interesting to me.
p242
aa(lp243
VMy focus in recent years
p244
aVhas kind of shifted more toward biology.
p245
aVSome of these paintings, when you look at them very close,
p246
aVodd things appear
p247
aVthat really look like horses or birds
p248
aVor crocodiles, elephants.
p249
aVThere are lots of things that appear.
p250
aVWhen you look into it, it's sort of like looking at cloud patterns,
p251
aVbut sometimes they're very modeled and highly rendered.
p252
aVAnd then there are all these forms
p253
aVthat we don't know what they are,
p254
aVbut they're equally well-resolved
p255
aVand complex.
p256
aVSo I think, conceivably, those could be predictive.
p257
aVBecause since it has the ability
p258
aVto make forms
p259
aVthat look like forms that we're familiar with
p260
aVin biology,
p261
aVit's also making other forms that we're not familiar with.
p262
aVAnd maybe it's the kind of forms
p263
aVwe'll discover underneath the surface of Mars,
p264
aVwhere there are probably lakes
p265
aVwith fish swimming under the surface.
p266
aa(lp267
VJH: Oh, let's hope so. Oh, my God, let's.
p268
aVOh, please, yes. Oh, I'm so there.
p269
aVYou know, it seems
p270
aVat this stage in your life,
p271
aVyou also very personally
p272
aVare in this state of confrontation
p273
aVwith a sort of dissonant \u2014
p274
aVI suppose it's an electromagnetic force
p275
aVthat somehow governs your Parkinson's
p276
aVand this creative force
p277
aVthat is both the artist
p278
aVwho is in the here and now
p279
aVand this sort of arc of your whole life.
p280
aVIs that relevant to your work?
p281
aa(lp282
VTS: As it turns out,
p283
aVthis device kind of comes in handy,
p284
aVbecause I don't have to have
p285
aVthe fine motor skills to do,
p286
aVthat I can operate slides,
p287
aVwhich is more of a mental process.
p288
aVI'm looking at it and making decisions:
p289
aVIt needs more red, it needs more blue,
p290
aVit needs a different shape.
p291
aVAnd so I make these creative decisions
p292
aVand can execute them
p293
aVin a much, much simpler way.
p294
aVI mean, I've got the symptoms.
p295
aVI guess Parkinson's kind of creeps up over the years,
p296
aVbut at a certain point you start seeing the symptoms.
p297
aVIn my case,
p298
aVmy left hand has a significant tremor
p299
aVand my left leg also.
p300
aVI'm left-handed, and so I draw.
p301
aVAll my creations
p302
aVreally start on small drawings,
p303
aVwhich I have thousands of,
p304
aVand it's my way of just thinking.
p305
aVI draw with a simple pencil,
p306
aVand at first, the Parkinson's
p307
aVwas really upsetting,
p308
aVbecause I couldn't get the pencil to stand still.
p309
aa(lp310
VJH: So you're not a gatekeeper for these forces.
p311
aVYou don't think of yourself as the master of these forces.
p312
aVYou think of yourself as the servant.
p313
aa(lp314
VTS: Nature is \u2014 well, it's a godsend.
p315
aVIt just has so much in it.
p316
aVAnd I think nature
p317
aVwants to express itself
p318
aVin the sense that we are nature,
p319
aVhumans are of the universe.
p320
aVThe universe is in our mind,
p321
aVand our minds are in the universe.
p322
aVAnd we are expressions
p323
aVof the universe, basically.
p324
aVAs humans,
p325
aVultimately being part of the universe,
p326
aVwe're kind of the spokespeople
p327
aVor the observer part
p328
aVof the constituency
p329
aVof the universe.
p330
aVAnd to interface with it,
p331
aVwith a device that lets these forces
p332
aVthat are everywhere
p333
aVact and show what they can do,
p334
aVgiving them pigment and paint just like an artist,
p335
aVit's a good ally.
p336
aVIt's a terrific studio assistant.
p337
aa(lp338
VJH: Well, I love the idea
p339
aVthat somewhere within this idea
p340
aVof fine motion and control
p341
aVwith the traditional skills
p342
aVthat you have with your hand,
p343
aVsome sort of more elemental force gets revealed,
p344
aVand that's the beauty here.
p345
aVTom, thank you so much. It's been really, really great.
p346
aa(lp347
