VGood morning.
p4
aVMy name is David Rose.
p5
aVI am a serial entrepreneur turned serial investor.
p6
aVAnd by the use of pitching PowerPoints to VCs,
p7
aVI have personally raised tens of millions of dollars
p8
aVfrom VCs through PowerPoint pitches.
p9
aVAnd turning to the other side of the equation,
p10
aVI've personally supervised the investment of tens of millions of dollars
p11
aVinto companies who have pitched me with PowerPoint presentations.
p12
aVSo I think it's safe to say
p13
aVI know a little bit about the process of pitching.
p14
aa(lp15
VSo, the very first question you've got to figure out is:
p16
aVWhat is the single most important thing that a VC is looking for
p17
aVwhen you come to them pitching your new business idea?
p18
aVThere are obviously all kinds of things \u2014
p19
aVbusiness models and financials and markets and this and that.
p20
aVOverall, of all the things that you have to do,
p21
aVwhat is the single most important thing
p22
aVthe VC is going to be investing in?
p23
aVSomebody? What?
p24
aa(lp25
VAudience: People!
p26
aa(lp27
VDavid Rose: People! You! That's it \u2014 you are the person.
p28
aVTherefore, the entire purpose of a VC pitch is to convince them
p29
aVthat you are the entrepreneur in whom they are going to invest their money
p30
aVand make a lot of money in return.
p31
aa(lp32
VNow, how do you do this?
p33
aVYou can't just walk up and say,
p34
aV"Hi, I'm a really good guy, good girl, and you should invest in me." Right?
p35
aVSo in the course of your VC pitch \u2014 you have a very few minutes;
p36
aVmost VC pitches, angel pitches, are about 15 minutes,
p37
aVmost should be less than half an hour \u2014
p38
aVpeople's attention span, after 18 minutes, begins to drop off.
p39
aVTests have shown.
p40
aVSo in that 18 or 10 or five minutes,
p41
aVyou have to convey a whole bunch of different characteristics,
p42
aVabout 10 different characteristics,
p43
aVwhile you're standing up there.
p44
aVWhat's the single most important thing you've got to convey? What?
p45
aa(lp46
VAudience: Integrity.
p47
aa(lp48
VDR: Boy, oh boy, oh boy!
p49
aVThat's a straight line, look at that!
p50
aVAnd I didn't even prompt him.
p51
aVRight, integrity. The key thing.
p52
aVI would much rather invest in, take a chance on,
p53
aVsomebody who I know is straight than where there's any possible question
p54
aVof who are they looking out for, and what's going on.
p55
aVSo the most important thing is integrity.
p56
aVWhat's the second most important thing?
p57
aVLet's see if you can get this one.
p58
aa(lp59
VAudience: Self-confidence.
p60
aa(lp61
VDR: Close enough. Passion.
p62
aVRight? Entrepreneurs, by definition, are people who are leaving something else,
p63
aVstarting a new world, creating and putting their lifeblood into this thing.
p64
aVYou've got to convey passion.
p65
aVIf you're not passionate,
p66
aVwhy should anyone else be, or put money into your company
p67
aVif you're not passionate about it?
p68
aVIntegrity, passion: the most important things.
p69
aa(lp70
VThen there's a whole panoply of other things you've got to wrap up
p71
aVin this package you're presenting to a VC.
p72
aVExperience: you've got to be able to say,
p73
aV"Hey, you know, I've done this before."
p74
aV"Done this before" is starting an enterprise, creating value,
p75
aVand taking something from beginning to end.
p76
aVThat's why VCs love to fund serial entrepreneurs \u2014
p77
aVeven if you didn't do it right the first time,
p78
aVyou've learned the lessons, which puts you in good stead the next time.
p79
aa(lp80
VAlong with the experience of starting an enterprise or running something \u2014
p81
aVdoesn't have to be a business,
p82
aVit can be an organization in a school, a not-for-profit.
p83
aVBut experience in creating an organization.
p84
aa(lp85
VNext: knowledge.
p86
aVIf you tell me
p87
aVyou're going to be the developer of the map of the human genome,
p88
aVyou better know what a human genome is; I want you to have expertise.
p89
aVI don't want somebody who says,
p90
aV"I've got a great idea in a business I know nothing about.
p91
aVI don't know who the players are, what the market is like."
p92
aVYou've got to know your market, your area.
p93
aa(lp94
VAnd you have to have the skills that it takes
p95
aVto get a company going.
p96
aVThose skills include everything from technical skills
p97
aVif it's a technology business,
p98
aVto marketing and sales and management and so on.
p99
aVBut, you know, not everybody has all these skills.
p100
aVVery few people have the full set of skills it takes to run a company.
p101
aa(lp102
VWhat else do you require? Well, leadership.
p103
aVYou've got to be able to convince us that you either have developed a team
p104
aVthat has all those factors in it, or else you can.
p105
aVAnd you have the charisma and the management style
p106
aVand the ability to get people to follow your lead,
p107
aVto inspire them, to motivate them to be part of your team.
p108
aa(lp109
VHaving done all that,
p110
aVwhat else do I want to know as a VC?
p111
aVI want to know that you have commitment.
p112
aVThat you are going to be here to the end.
p113
aVI want you to say \u2014 or I want you to convey \u2014
p114
aVthat you are going to die if you have to, with your very last breath,
p115
aVyour fingernails scratching as they draw you out.
p116
aVYou'll keep my money alive and make more from it.
p117
aVI don't want someone who'll cut and run at the first opportunity.
p118
aVBad things happen.
p119
aVThere's never been a venture-funded company where bad things didn't happen.
p120
aVSo know that you're committed to the very end.
p121
aa(lp122
VYou've got to have vision to see where this is going.
p123
aVI don't want another "me too" product.
p124
aVI want somebody who can change the world out there.
p125
aVBut on top of that, I need realism,
p126
aVBecause while changing the world is great, it doesn't always happen.
p127
aVAnd before you get to change the world,
p128
aVbad things are going to take place;
p129
aVyou have to deal with that.
p130
aVAnd you have to have rational projections.
p131
aa(lp132
VFinally, you're asking for my money \u2014
p133
aVnot just because it's my money, but because it's me.
p134
aVYou need to be coachable.
p135
aVI need to know you have the ability to listen.
p136
aVWe've had a lot of experience.
p137
aVPeople who are VCs or angels investing in you have had experience,
p138
aVand they'd like to know that you want to hear that experience.
p139
aa(lp140
VSo how do you convey these 10 things in 10 minutes without saying them?
p141
aVYou can't say, "I've got integrity, invest in me!"
p142
aVYou've got to do a whole pitch that conveys this without conveying it.
p143
aVThink about your pitch as a timeline.
p144
aVIt starts off, you walk in the door.
p145
aVThey know nothing whatsoever about you.
p146
aVYou can take them on an emotional \u2014 all pitches, all sales presentations,
p147
aVare emotional at some level.
p148
aVYou can go up, you can go down, right?
p149
aVAnd it goes from beginning to end.
p150
aa(lp151
VYou walk in, the first thing you've got to do,
p152
aVthe overall arc of your presentation, it's got to start like a rocket.
p153
aVYou've got maybe 10 seconds \u2014
p154
aVbetween 10 and 30 seconds, depending on how long the pitch is \u2014
p155
aVto get their attention.
p156
aVIn my case, I've invested.
p157
aVI've gotten millions of dollars from PowerPoint pitches.
p158
aV"I've invested millions." That should get you right there.
p159
aVThis can be a fact or something counterintuitive.
p160
aVIt can be a story or an experience.
p161
aVBut you've got to grab their emotional attention, focused on you,
p162
aVwithin that first few seconds.
p163
aVAnd then from there, you've got to take them
p164
aVon a very solid, steady, upward path, right from beginning to end.
p165
aVEverything has to reinforce this.
p166
aa(lp167
VAnd you've got to get better and better and better,
p168
aVrevving up to the very end,
p169
aVthen you've got to \u2014 boom! \u2014
p170
aVknock them out of the park.
p171
aVYou want to get them to such an emotional high
p172
aVthey're ready to write you a check, throw money at you,
p173
aVbefore you leave.
p174
aa(lp175
VHow do you do that?
p176
aVFirst of all, logical progression.
p177
aVAny time you go backwards, any time you skip a step \u2014
p178
aVimagine walking up a staircase where some of the treads are missing,
p179
aVor the heights are different.
p180
aVYou stop, you need to figure out a nice, logical progression.
p181
aVStart with what the market is: Why are you going to do X, Y or Z?
p182
aVAnd then you've got to tell me how you're going to do it,
p183
aVand what you're going to do.
p184
aVAnd it's got to flow from beginning to end.
p185
aa(lp186
VYou've got to let me know there are touchstones,
p187
aVto tie in to the rest of the world out there.
p188
aVFor example, reference companies I've heard of,
p189
aVor basic items in your business.
p190
aVI want to know about things that I can relate to:
p191
aVvalidators, or anything that tells me somebody else has approved this,
p192
aVor there's outside validation.
p193
aVIt can be sales; it can be you got an award for something;
p194
aVit can be people have done it before;
p195
aVit can be your beta tests are going great, whatever.
p196
aVI want to know validation \u2014 not just what you're telling me,
p197
aVbut that somebody or something else out there
p198
aVsays this makes sense.
p199
aVAnd then, I'm looking for the upside; I need a believable upside.
p200
aVThat's two parts; it's got to be upside and believable.
p201
aVThe upside means if you tell me that five years out,
p202
aVyou're making a million dollars a year, that's not really upside.
p203
aVTelling me you'll be making a billion dollars a year \u2014
p204
aVthat's not believable.
p205
aVSo it's got to be both.
p206
aa(lp207
VOn the other hand are things that take the emotional level down.
p208
aVYou have to recover from those.
p209
aVFor example, anything that I know is not true.
p210
aV"We have no competition. Nobody makes a widget like this."
p211
aVOdds are I know somebody who's made a widget,
p212
aVand the minute you tell me that,
p213
aVI discount half of what you're saying from then on.
p214
aVAnything I don't understand,
p215
aVwhere I have to make the leap myself, in my own head,
p216
aVwill stop the flow of the presentation.
p217
aVSo you've got to take me through like a sixth-grader \u2014
p218
aVdub, dub, dub \u2014 but without patronizing me.
p219
aVAnd it's a very tricky path.
p220
aVBut if you can do it, it works really well.
p221
aa(lp222
VAnything that's inconsistent within your concept \u2014
p223
aVif you tell me sales of X, Y or Z are 10 million dollars,
p224
aVfive slides later, they're five million dollars ...
p225
aVOne may have been gross sales, one may have been net sales,
p226
aVbut I want to know that all the numbers make sense together.
p227
aa(lp228
VAnd then, finally: anything that's an error or a typo,
p229
aVor a stupid mistake or a line that's in the wrong place \u2014
p230
aVthat shows me that if you can't do a presentation, how can you run a company?
p231
aVSo this all feeds in together.
p232
aa(lp233
VThe best way to do this is to look at our betters,
p234
aVpeople who have done this before.
p235
aVLet's look at the most successful technology executive in the business,
p236
aVand see how a presentation goes.
p237
aVBill Gates's PowerPoint presentation over here.
p238
aVHere's Gates doing a thing for Windows.
p239
aVIs this how to do a PowerPoint presentation? What do you think?
p240
aVNo. Who do you think we should look at as our role model?
p241
aa(lp242
VOh, isn't that funny! There's another great one over here.
p243
aVOK, Steve Jobs.
p244
aVYou want absolute \u2014 this is the Zen of presentation, right?
p245
aVHere he is, one little guy, black jeans and stuff,
p246
aVon a totally empty stage.
p247
aVWhat are you focusing on?
p248
aVYou're focusing on him! This is Steve Jobs.
p249
aa(lp250
VSo are these wonderful long bullet points, whole list of things good?
p251
aVNo, they're not. The long bullet points are bad.
p252
aVWhat's good? Short. Short bullet points.
p253
aVBut you know what? Even better than short bullet points are no bullet points.
p254
aVJust give me the headline.
p255
aVAnd you know what?
p256
aVHow many bullet points does Steve Jobs use?
p257
aVBasically, none.
p258
aVWhat do you do?
p259
aVBest of all, images. Just a simple image.
p260
aVI look at the image; a picture's worth a thousand words.
p261
aVYou look at the image and you've got the whole thing.
p262
aVThen you come back to me; you're focused on me, why I'm such a great guy,
p263
aVwhy you want to invest, why this all makes sense.
p264
aa(lp265
VThat said, we only have a very short time,
p266
aVso let's run through the things to include in your presentation.
p267
aVFirst of all, none of these big, long-titled slides
p268
aVwith blah, blah, I'm presenting to so-and-so on X date.
p269
aVI know the day, I know who I am \u2014 I don't need all that.
p270
aVJust give me your company logo.
p271
aVI look at the logo, and it ties it to my brain.
p272
aVThen I come back to you. I'm focused on you, OK?
p273
aVYou give me your quick, 15-second or 30-second intro, grab my attention.
p274
aVThen you give me a quick business overview.
p275
aVThis is not a five-minute pitch. This is, you know, two sentences.
p276
aV"We build widgets for the X, Y, Z market."
p277
aVOr, "We sell services to help do X." You know, whatever.
p278
aVAnd that is like the picture on the outside of a jigsaw puzzle box.
p279
aVThat lets me know the context.
p280
aVIt gives me the armature for the whole thing you'll be going through;
p281
aVit lets me put everything in relation to what you've told me.
p282
aa(lp283
VThen you've got to walk me through, show me who your management team is.
p284
aVI want to know the size of the market. Why is this market worth getting at?
p285
aVI want to know your product, that's very important.
p286
aVNow, this is not a product pitch or sales pitch.
p287
aVI don't want to know all the ins and outs, just what the heck is it?
p288
aVIf it's a website, show me a screenshot of your website.
p289
aVDon't do a live demo. Never do a live demo.
p290
aVDo a canned demo, or something that lets me know
p291
aVwhy people are going to buy whatever it is.
p292
aa(lp293
VNow that I know what you're selling,
p294
aVtell me how you make money on it.
p295
aVFor every X you sell, you get Y, or services of Z.
p296
aVI want to know what the business model is on a per-unit basis,
p297
aVor for the actual product you're selling.
p298
aVI want to know who you're selling to in terms of customers
p299
aVand if you have any special relationships that will help you,
p300
aVwhether it's a distribution relationship or a producing partner.
p301
aVAgain, validation.
p302
aVThis helps to say you're bigger than just one little thing over here.
p303
aa(lp304
VBut everybody has competition.
p305
aVThere's never been a company with no competition,
p306
aVeven if the competition is the old way of doing something.
p307
aVI want to know exactly what your competition is,
p308
aVand that will help me judge how you fit into the whole operation.
p309
aVI want to know how you're special.
p310
aa(lp311
VI know what your competition does \u2014
p312
aVhow are you going to prevent them from eating your lunch?
p313
aVAll this ties into the financial overview.
p314
aVAnd you can't do a VC pitch without giving me your financials.
p315
aVI want to know a year or two back, or as long as you've been in existence.
p316
aVAnd I want to know four or five years forward.
p317
aVFive is a bit much. Probably four.
p318
aa(lp319
VAnd I want to know how that business model, on a product basis,
p320
aVwill translate into a company model: How many widgets will you sell?
p321
aVYou make X amount per widget. I want to know what the driver is.
p322
aVWe'll have 1,000 customers this year and 10,000 the next,
p323
aVour revenues will do this and that.
p324
aVThat gives me the whole picture for the next several years
p325
aVinto which I'm investing.
p326
aVAnd I want to know how the money from me will help you get there.
p327
aVYou're going to open an offshore plant in China,
p328
aVyou're going to spend it all on sales and marketing,
p329
aVyou're going to go to Tahiti, whatever.
p330
aa(lp331
VBut then comes the ask, where you tell me how much you want.
p332
aVYou're looking for 5 million \u2014 at what valuation?
p333
aVTwo million? 100,000?
p334
aVWhat's the money in so far? Who invested?
p335
aVI hope you invested \u2014 if you can't invest in your own thing, why should I?
p336
aVSo I like to know if you have friends and family,
p337
aVor angel investors, or more VCs before.
p338
aVWhat's the capital structure up until this point?
p339
aVFinally, having done all that, you've now told me the whole thing,
p340
aVso now you bring it back to that conclusion.
p341
aVThis is that rocket going up.
p342
aVHopefully everything has been positive.
p343
aVAnd everything you say clicks, it all makes sense.
p344
aVAnd I'm thinking, "This is really great!"
p345
aa(lp346
VThen you take me back to just your logo on the screen.
p347
aVAnd I look at the logo \u2014 OK, good.
p348
aVNow I come back to you. Nothing else to look at, right?
p349
aVNow you've got to wrap it up to give me the final \u2014 boom! \u2014
p350
aVthe final pitch that's going to send me into space.
p351
aVNow, in the process of doing this,
p352
aVhow do you remember the sequences and do it?
p353
aVYou've noticed I'm not looking at the screen, right?
p354
aVThe screen is in front of me,
p355
aVso I couldn't even see if I wanted to.
p356
aa(lp357
VSo how do I know what's going on?
p358
aVWell, I have a laptop in front of me.
p359
aVYou're looking at me and at this.
p360
aVWhat am I looking at?
p361
aVYou think that I'm looking at that?
p362
aVNo, I'm looking, actually,
p363
aVat a special version of PowerPoint over here,
p364
aVwhich shows me the slides ahead and behind, my notes,
p365
aVso I can see what's going on.
p366
aVPowerPoint has this built into every copy of it that's shipped.
p367
aVIf you use Apple's Keynote, it's got an even better version.
p368
aVThere's another program called Ovation you can get from Adobe
p369
aVthat they bought last summer,
p370
aVwhich helps you run the timers and lets you figure out what's going on.
p371
aa(lp372
VSo, here's my wrap-up to take you to the moon, right?
p373
aVI usually do a Top 10, but we don't have time,
p374
aVso: David's Top Five Presentation Tips.
p375
aVNumber five: always use presenter mode,
p376
aVor Ovation, or presenter tools.
p377
aVIt lets you know exactly where you're going,
p378
aVhelps you pace yourself, gives you a timer, the whole bit.
p379
aa(lp380
VNumber four: always use remote control.
p381
aVHave you seen me touch the computer? No. Why not?
p382
aVBecause I'm using remote control. Always use remote control.
p383
aa(lp384
VNumber three: the handouts you give are not your presentation.
p385
aVIf you follow my suggestions,
p386
aVyou'll have a very spare, Zen-like presentation,
p387
aVwhich is great to convey who you are and get people emotionally involved,
p388
aVbut not good as a handout.
p389
aVYou want a handout that gives more information; it has to stand without you.
p390
aa(lp391
VNumber two: don't read your speech. Can you imagine?
p392
aa(lp393
V(Reading) "You should invest in my company ... "
p394
aa(lp395
VIt doesn't work.
p396
aVAnd the number one presentation tip: never, ever look at the screen.
p397
aVYou're making a connection with your audience,
p398
aVand you always want a one-on-one connection.
p399
aVThe screen should come up behind you
p400
aVand supplement what you're doing, instead of replace you.
p401
aVAnd that is how to pitch to a VC.
