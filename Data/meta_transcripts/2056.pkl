VAs a kid I always loved information
p4
aVthat I could get from data
p5
aVand the stories that could be told with numbers.
p6
aVI remember, growing up, I'd be frustrated at
p7
aVhow my own parents would lie to me using numbers.
p8
aV"Talithia, if I've told you once  I've told you a thousand times."
p9
aVNo dad, you've only told me 17 times
p10
aVand twice it wasn't my fault. (Laughter)
p11
aa(lp12
VI think that is one of the reasons I got a Ph.D. in statistics.
p13
aVI always wanted to know,
p14
aVwhat are people trying to hide with numbers?
p15
aVAs a statistician,
p16
aVI want people to show me the data
p17
aVso I can decide for myself.
p18
aVDonald and I were pregnant with our third child
p19
aVand we were at about 41 and a half weeks,
p20
aVwhat some of you may refer to as being overdue.
p21
aVStatisticians, we call that
p22
aVbeing within the 95 percent confidence interval.
p23
aV(Laughter)
p24
aVAnd at this point in the process
p25
aVwe had to come in every couple of days
p26
aVto do a stress test on the baby,
p27
aVand this is just routine,
p28
aVit tests whether or not the baby  is feeling any type of undue stress.
p29
aVAnd you are rarely, if ever, seen by your actual doctor,
p30
aVjust whoever happens to be  working at the hospital that day.
p31
aVSo we go in for a stress test and after 20 minutes
p32
aVthe doctor comes out and he says,
p33
aV"Your baby is under stress, we need to induce you."
p34
aVNow, as a statistician, what's my response?
p35
aVShow me the data!
p36
aVSo then he proceeds to tell us
p37
aVthe baby's heart rate trace went from 18 minutes,
p38
aVthe baby's heart rate was in the normal zone
p39
aVand for two minutes it was in what appeared to be
p40
aVmy heart rate zone and I said,
p41
aV"Is it possible that maybe this was my heart rate?
p42
aVI was moving around a little bit,
p43
aVit's hard to lay still on your back,
p44
aV41 weeks pregnant for 20 minutes.
p45
aVMaybe it was shifting around."
p46
aVHe said, "Well, we don't want to take any chances."
p47
aVI said okay.
p48
aVI said, "What if I was at 36 weeks
p49
aVwith this same data?
p50
aVWould your decision be to induce?"
p51
aV"Well, no, I would wait until you were at least
p52
aV38 weeks, but you are almost 42,
p53
aVthere is no reason to leave that baby inside,
p54
aVlet's get you a room."
p55
aVI said, "Well, why don't we just do it again?
p56
aVWe can collect more data.
p57
aVI can try to be really still for 20 minutes.
p58
aVWe can average the two and see
p59
aVwhat that means. (Laughter)
p60
aVAnd he goes,
p61
aV"Ma'am, I just don't want you to have a miscarriage."
p62
aVThat makes three of us.
p63
aVAnd then he says,
p64
aV"Your chances of having a miscarriage double
p65
aVwhen you go past your due date. Let's get you a room."
p66
aVWow. So now as a statistician, what's my response?
p67
aVShow me the data!
p68
aVDude, you're talking chances,
p69
aVI do chances all day long, tell me all about chances.
p70
aVLet's talk chances. (Laughter)
p71
aVLet's talk chances.
p72
aa(lp73
VSo I say, "Okay, great.
p74
aVDo I go from a 30-percent  chance to a 60-percent chance?
p75
aVWhere are we here with this miscarriage thing?
p76
aVAnd he goes, "Not quite, but it doubles,
p77
aVand we really just want what's best for the baby."
p78
aVUndaunted, I try a different angle.
p79
aVI said, "Okay, out of 1,000 full-term pregnant women,
p80
aVhow many of them are going to miscarry
p81
aVjust before their due date?
p82
aVAnd then he looks at me and looks at Donald,
p83
aVand he goes, about one in 1,000.
p84
aVI said, "Okay, so of those 1,000 women, how many
p85
aVare going to miscarry just after their due date?"
p86
aa(lp87
V"About two." (Laughter)
p88
aVI said, "Okay, so you are telling me that my chances
p89
aVgo from a 0.1-percent chance
p90
aVto a 0.2-percent chance."
p91
aa(lp92
VOkay, so at this point the data is not convincing us
p93
aVthat we need to be induced,
p94
aVand so then we proceed to have a conversation
p95
aVabout how inductions lead to a higher rate
p96
aVof Cesarean sections, and if at all  possible we'd like to avoid that.
p97
aVAnd then I said,
p98
aV"And I really don't think my due date is accurate."
p99
aV(Laughter)
p100
aVAnd so this really stunned him
p101
aVand he looked sort of puzzled
p102
aVand I said, "You may not know this,
p103
aVbut pregnancy due dates are calculated
p104
aVassuming that you have a standard 28-day cycle,
p105
aVand my cycle ranges \u2014
p106
aVsometimes it's 27, sometimes it's up to 38 \u2014
p107
aVand I have been collecting the data to prove it.
p108
aV(Laughter)
p109
aVAnd so we ended up leaving the hospital  that day without being induced.
p110
aVWe actually had to sign a waiver  to walk out of the hospital.
p111
aVAnd I'm not advocating that you not listen to your doctors,
p112
aVbecause even with our first child,
p113
aVwe were induced at 38 weeks; cervical fluid was low.
p114
aVI'm not anti-medical intervention.
p115
aVBut why were confident to leave that day?
p116
aVWell, we had data that told a different story.
p117
aVWe had been collecting data for six years.
p118
aVI had this temperature data,
p119
aVand it told a different story.
p120
aVIn fact, we could probably pretty  accurately estimate conception.
p121
aVYeah, that's a story you want to tell
p122
aVat your kid's wedding reception. (Laughter)
p123
aVI remember like it was yesterday.
p124
aVMy temperature was a sizzling 97.8 degrees
p125
aVas I stared into your father's eyes. (Laughter)
p126
aVOh, yeah. Twenty-two more years, we're telling that story.
p127
aVBut we were confident to leave  because we had been collecting data.
p128
aVNow, what does that data look like?
p129
aVHere's a standard chart
p130
aVof a woman's waking body temperature
p131
aVduring the course of a cycle.
p132
aVSo from the beginning of the menstrual cycle
p133
aVtill the beginning of the next.
p134
aVYou'll see that the temperature is not random.
p135
aVClearly there is a low pattern
p136
aVat the beginning of her cycle
p137
aVand then you see this jump and then a higher
p138
aVset of temperatures at the end of her cycle.
p139
aVSo what's happening here?
p140
aVWhat is that data telling you?
p141
aVWell, ladies, at the beginning of our cycle,
p142
aVthe hormone estrogen is dominant and that estrogen
p143
aVcauses a suppression of your body temperature.
p144
aVAnd at ovulation, your body releases an egg
p145
aVand progesterone takes over, pro-gestation.
p146
aVAnd so your body heats up in anticipation
p147
aVof housing this new little fertilized egg.
p148
aVSo why this temperature jump?
p149
aVWell, think about when a bird sits on her eggs.
p150
aVWhy is she sitting on them?
p151
aVShe wants to keep them warm,
p152
aVprotect them and keep them warm.
p153
aVLadies, this is exactly what our bodies do every month,
p154
aVthey heat up in anticipation
p155
aVof keeping a new little life warm.
p156
aVAnd if nothing happens, if you are not pregnant,
p157
aVthen estrogen takes back over and  that cycle starts all over again.
p158
aVBut if you do get pregnant, sometimes you
p159
aVactually see another shift in your temperatures
p160
aVand it stays elevated for those whole nine months.
p161
aVThat's why you see those pregnant  women just sweating and hot,
p162
aVbecause their temperatures are high.
p163
aVHere's a chart that we had about three or four years ago.
p164
aVWe were really very excited about this chart.
p165
aVYou'll see the low temperature level
p166
aVand then a shift and for about five days,
p167
aVthat's about the time it takes for the egg to travel
p168
aVdown the fallopian tube and implant,
p169
aVand then you see those temperatures  start to go up a little bit.
p170
aVAnd in fact, we had a second temperature shift,
p171
aVconfirmed with a pregnancy test  that were indeed pregnant
p172
aVwith our first child, very exciting.
p173
aVUntil a couple of days later
p174
aVI saw some spotting and then I noticed heavy blood flow,
p175
aVand we had in fact had an early stage miscarriage.
p176
aVHad I not been taking my temperature
p177
aVI really would have just thought  my period was late that month,
p178
aVbut we actually had data to show
p179
aVthat we had miscarried this baby,
p180
aVand even though this data revealed a really
p181
aVunfortunate event in our lives,
p182
aVit was information that we could then take to our doctor.
p183
aVSo if there was a fertility issue or some problem,
p184
aVI had data to show:
p185
aVLook, we got pregnant, our temperature shifted,
p186
aVwe somehow lost this baby.
p187
aVWhat is it that we can do to help prevent this problem?
p188
aVAnd it's not just about temperatures
p189
aVand it's not just about fertility;
p190
aVwe can use data about our bodies to tell us a lot of things.
p191
aa(lp192
VFor instance, did you know that taking  your temperature can tell you a lot
p193
aVabout the condition of your thyroid?
p194
aVSo, your thyroid works a lot like  the thermostat in your house.
p195
aVThere is an optimal temperature  that you want in your house;
p196
aVyou set your thermostat.
p197
aVWhen it gets too cold in the house, your thermostat kicks in
p198
aVand says, "Hey, we need to blow some heat around."
p199
aVOr if it gets too hot, your thermostat
p200
aVregisters, "Turn the A.C. on. Cool us off."
p201
aVThat's exactly how your thyroid works in your body.
p202
aVYour thyroid tries to keep an optimal temperature
p203
aVfor your body.
p204
aVIf it gets too cold, your thyroid  says, "Hey, we need to heat up."
p205
aVIf it gets too hot, your thyroid cools you down.
p206
aVBut what happens when your  thyroid is not functioning well?
p207
aVWhen it doesn't function, then it shows up
p208
aVin your body temperatures,
p209
aVthey tend to be lower than normal or very erratic.
p210
aVAnd so by collecting this data
p211
aVyou can find out information about your thyroid.
p212
aa(lp213
VNow, what is it, if you had a thyroid  problem and you went to the doctor,
p214
aVyour doctor would actually test the amount of
p215
aVthyroid stimulating hormone in your blood.
p216
aVFine. But the problem with that test is
p217
aVit doesn't tell you how active the hormone is in your body.
p218
aVSo you might have a lot of hormone present,
p219
aVbut it might not be actively working to regulate
p220
aVyour body temperature.
p221
aVSo just by collecting your temperature every day,
p222
aVyou get information about the condition of your thyroid.
p223
aVSo, what if you don't want to take  your temperature every day?
p224
aVI advocate that you do,
p225
aVbut there are tons of other things you could take.
p226
aVYou could take your blood pressure,  you could take your weight \u2014
p227
aVyeah, who's excited about
p228
aVtaking their weight every day? (Laughter)
p229
aa(lp230
VEarly on in our marriage, Donald had a stuffy nose
p231
aVand he had been taking a slew of medications
p232
aVto try to relieve his stuffy nose, to no avail.
p233
aVAnd so, that night he comes and  he wakes me up and he says,
p234
aV"Honey, I can't breath out of my nose."
p235
aVAnd I roll over and I look, and I said,  "Well, can you breath out of your mouth?"
p236
aV(Laughter)
p237
aVAnd he goes, "Yes, but I can't breath out of my nose!"
p238
aVAnd so like any good wife, I rush him
p239
aVto the emergency room
p240
aVat 2 o'clock in the morning.
p241
aVAnd the whole time I'm driving and I'm thinking,
p242
aVyou can't die on me now.
p243
aVWe just got married,
p244
aVpeople will think I killed you! (Laughter)
p245
aVAnd so, we get to the emergency  room, and the nurse sees us,
p246
aVand he can't breath out of his nose, and so
p247
aVshe brings us to the back and the doctor says,
p248
aV"What seems to be the problem?" and  he goes, "I can't breath out of my nose."
p249
aVAnd he said, "You can't breath out of your nose?
p250
aVNo, but he can breath out of his mouth. (Laughter)
p251
aVHe takes a step back and he looks at both of us
p252
aVand he says "Sir, I think I know the problem.
p253
aVYou're having a heart attack.
p254
aVI'm going to order an EKG and a CAT scan
p255
aVfor you immediately."
p256
aVAnd we are thinking,
p257
aVno, no, no. It's not a heart attack. He can breathe,
p258
aVjust out of his mouth. No, no, no, no, no.
p259
aVAnd so we go back and forth with this doctor
p260
aVbecause we think this is the incorrect diagnosis,
p261
aVand he's like, "No really, it'll be fine, just calm down."
p262
aVAnd I'm thinking, how do you calm down?  But I don't think he's having a heart attack.
p263
aVAnd so fortunately for us, this  doctor was at the end of the shift.
p264
aVSo this new doctor comes in, he sees us clearly
p265
aVdistraught, with a husband who can't breath
p266
aVout of his nose. (Laughter)
p267
aVAnd he starts asking us questions.
p268
aVHe says, "Well, do you two exercise?"
p269
aVWe ride our bikes, we go to the gym occasionally.
p270
aV(Laughter)
p271
aVWe move around.
p272
aVAnd he says, "What were you doing  just before you came here?"
p273
aVI'm thinking, I was sleeping, honestly.
p274
aVBut okay, what was Donald doing just before?
p275
aVSo Donald goes into this slew  of medications he was taking.
p276
aVHe lists, "I took this decongestant  and then I took this nasal spray,"
p277
aVand then all of a sudden a lightbulb goes off and he says,
p278
aV"Oh! You should never mix this  decongestant with this nasal spray.
p279
aVClogs you up every time. Here, take this one instead."
p280
aVHe gives us a prescription.
p281
aVWe're looking at each other, and I looked at the doctor,
p282
aVand I said, "Why is it that it seems like you
p283
aVwere able to accurately diagnose his condition,
p284
aVbut this previous doctor wanted to order
p285
aVan EKG and a CAT scan?"
p286
aVAnd he looks at us and says,
p287
aV"Well, when a 350-pound man walks in the  emergency room and says he can't breath,
p288
aVyou assume he's having a heart attack
p289
aVand you ask questions later."
p290
aVNow, emergency room doctors are  trained to make decisions quickly,
p291
aVbut not always accurately.
p292
aVAnd so had we had some information
p293
aVabout our heart health to share with him,
p294
aVmaybe we would have gotten a  better diagnosis the first time.
p295
aa(lp296
VI want you to consider the following chart,
p297
aVof systolic blood pressure measurements
p298
aVfrom October 2010 to July 2012.
p299
aVYou'll see that these measurements start
p300
aVin the prehypertension/hypertension zone,
p301
aVbut over about the course of a year and a half
p302
aVthey move into the normal zone.
p303
aVThis is about the heart rate of a healthy 16-year-old.
p304
aVWhat story is this data telling you?
p305
aVObviously it's the data from someone
p306
aVwho's made a drastic transformation,
p307
aVand fortunately for us, that person  happens to be here today.
p308
aVSo that 350-pound guy that walked  into the emergency room with me
p309
aVis now an even sexier and healthier
p310
aV225-pound guy, and that's his blood pressure trace.
p311
aVSo over the course of that year and a half
p312
aVDonald's eating changed
p313
aVand our exercise regimen changed,
p314
aVand his heart rate responded,
p315
aVhis blood pressure responded to that change
p316
aVthat he made in his body.
p317
aa(lp318
VSo what's the take-home message
p319
aVthat I want you to leave with today?
p320
aVBy taking ownership of your data just like we've done,
p321
aVjust by taking this daily measurements about yourself,
p322
aVyou become the expert on your body.
p323
aVYou become the authority.
p324
aVIt's not hard to do.
p325
aVYou don't have to have a Ph.D. in statistics
p326
aVto be an expert in yourself.
p327
aVYou don't have to have a medical degree
p328
aVto be your body's expert.
p329
aVMedical doctors, they're experts on the population,
p330
aVbut you are the expert on yourself.
p331
aVAnd so when two of you come together,
p332
aVwhen two experts come together,
p333
aVthe two of you are able to make a better decision
p334
aVthan just your doctor alone.
p335
aVNow that you understand the power of information
p336
aVthat you can get through personal data collection,
p337
aVI'd like you all to stand and raise your right hand.
p338
aV(Laughter)
p339
aVYes, get it up.
p340
aVI challenge you to take ownership of your data.
p341
aVAnd today, I hereby confer upon you
p342
aVa TEDx associate's degree in elementary statistics
p343
aVwith a concentration in time-dependent data analysis
p344
aVwith all the rights and privileges appertaining thereto.
p345
aVAnd so the next time you are in your doctor's office,
p346
aVas newly inducted statisticians,
p347
aVwhat should always be your response?
p348
aVAudience: Show me the data!  Talithia Williams: I can't hear you!
p349
aVAudience: Show me the data!
p350
