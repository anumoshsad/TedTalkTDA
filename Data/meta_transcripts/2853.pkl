VIt's Christmas Eve, 1968.
p4
aVThe Apollo 8 spacecraft has successfully completed
p5
aVits first three orbits around the moon.
p6
aVLaunched from Cape Canaveral three days before,
p7
aVthis is the first time
p8
aVthat humans have ever traveled beyond low Earth orbit.
p9
aVOn the vessel's fourth pass,
p10
aVthe Earth slowly comes into view
p11
aVand reveals itself above the Moon's horizon.
p12
aVAstronaut Bill Anders frantically asks his crewmates where their camera is,
p13
aVgrabs the Hasselblad, points it towards the window,
p14
aVpresses the shutter,
p15
aVand takes one of the most important photographs of all time:
p16
aV"Earthrise."
p17
aa(lp18
VWhen the crew was safely home a few days later,
p19
aVthey were asked about the mission.
p20
aVAnders famously replied,
p21
aV"We went to the moon,
p22
aVbut we actually discovered Earth."
p23
aa(lp24
VWhat did he and his fellow crewmates feel
p25
aVin this incredible moment?
p26
aVIn a study released just this past year,
p27
aVa team of researchers at the University of Pennsylvania
p28
aVexamined the testimonies of hundreds of astronauts
p29
aVwho had the opportunity to view the Earth from space.
p30
aVTheir analysis uncovered three common feelings:
p31
aVfirst, a greater appreciation for Earth's beauty;
p32
aVsecond, an increased sense of connection to all other living beings;
p33
aVand third, an unexpected, often overwhelming sense of emotion.
p34
aVThe researchers believe that seeing the Earth from a great distance
p35
aVprovokes someone to develop new cognitive frameworks
p36
aVto understand what they are seeing.
p37
aVThey believe these astronauts were forever changed
p38
aVby this new view,
p39
aVthis new perspective,
p40
aVthis new visual truth.
p41
aVThis feeling is commonly referred to as the "overview effect."
p42
aa(lp43
VOnly 558 people have ever been to outer space.
p44
aV558 people had the opportunity
p45
aVto gaze down in awe,
p46
aVto wonder at our planet
p47
aVfloating in an infinite sea of darkness.
p48
aVBut what if that number were bigger?
p49
aa(lp50
VThree years ago, I set off on my own mission:
p51
aVto see if I could bring this feeling of overwhelming scale and beauty
p52
aVto many more people
p53
aVjust by using one small computer
p54
aVin my small New York City apartment.
p55
aVIt was then, in 2013, that I launched "Daily Overview."
p56
aVEvery day, I have used satellite imagery
p57
aVto create one expansive overhead view of our planet.
p58
aVMore than 1,000 of these images have been created thus far,
p59
aVand more than 600,000 people
p60
aVtune in for this daily dose of perspectives.
p61
aVI create the imagery by curating photos from the massive archive
p62
aVof a satellite company called Digital Globe.
p63
aVThey operate a constellation of five satellites,
p64
aVeach roughly the size of an ambulance,
p65
aVthat is constantly taking pictures of the Earth
p66
aVas they orbit at 28,000 kilometers per hour.
p67
aa(lp68
VNow, what does this mean?
p69
aVEach of these satellites is equipped with a camera
p70
aVthat has a focal length of 16 meters,
p71
aVso that's roughly 290 times greater
p72
aVthan a DSLR camera equipped with a standard 55 millimeter lens.
p73
aVSo if were able to attach one of their satellites
p74
aVto the roof of this theater in Oxford,
p75
aVwe could take a picture of a football,
p76
aVclearly, on the pitch at the stadium in Amsterdam.
p77
aVThat's 450 kilometers away.
p78
aVThat's incredibly powerful technology.
p79
aVAnd I decided at the beginning of this project
p80
aVthat I would use that incredible technology
p81
aVto focus on the places
p82
aVwhere humans have impacted the planet.
p83
aa(lp84
VAs a species, we dig and scrape the Earth for resources,
p85
aVwe produce energy,
p86
aVwe raise animals and cultivate crops for food,
p87
aVwe build cities, we move around,
p88
aVwe create waste.
p89
aVAnd in the process of doing all of these things,
p90
aVwe shape landscapes and seascapes
p91
aVand cityscapes with increasing control and impunity.
p92
aVSo with that in mind,
p93
aVI would like to share a few of my overviews with you now.
p94
aa(lp95
VHere we see cargo ships and oil tankers
p96
aVwaiting outside the entry to the port of Singapore.
p97
aVThis facility is the second-busiest in the world by terms of total tonnage,
p98
aVaccounting for one-fifth of the world's shipping containers
p99
aVand one half of the annual supply
p100
aVof crude oil.
p101
aa(lp102
VIf you look closely at this overview, you'll see a lot of little specks.
p103
aVThose are actually cows at a feedlot
p104
aVin Summerfield, Texas, in the United States.
p105
aVSo once cows reach a particular weight,
p106
aVroughly 300 kilograms,
p107
aVthey are moved here and placed on a specialized diet.
p108
aVOver the next three to four months, the cows gain an additional 180 kilograms
p109
aVbefore they are shipped off to slaughter.
p110
aVYou're also probably wondering about this glowing pool at the top there.
p111
aVThat gets its color from a unique combination of manure, chemicals
p112
aVand a particular type of algae that grows in the stagnant water.
p113
aa(lp114
VThis is the Mount Whaleback iron ore mine
p115
aVin the Pilbara region of Western Australia,
p116
aVa beautiful yet scary scar on the face of the Earth.
p117
aVOf the world's mined iron ore,
p118
aV98 percent is used to make steel
p119
aVand is therefore a major component in the construction of buildings,
p120
aVautomobiles or appliances such as your dishwasher or refrigerator.
p121
aa(lp122
VThis is a solar concentrator in Seville, Spain.
p123
aVSo this facility contains 2,650 mirrors
p124
aVwhich are arrayed in concentric circles around an 140-meter-tall tower
p125
aVat its center.
p126
aVAt the top of the tower,
p127
aVthere is a capsule of molten salt
p128
aVthat gets heated by the beams of light reflected upwards
p129
aVfrom the mirrors below.
p130
aVFrom there, the salt circulates to a storage tank underground,
p131
aVwhere it produces steam,
p132
aVwhich spins turbines
p133
aVand generates enough electricity to power 70,000 homes
p134
aVand offsets 30,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions every year.
p135
aa(lp136
VThis overview shows deforestation in Santa Cruz, Bolivia
p137
aVimmediately adjacent to untouched tracts of rainforest.
p138
aVDeforestation in the country has primarily been driven
p139
aVby the expansion of mechanized agriculture
p140
aVand cattle ranching,
p141
aVso as the country tries to meet the demand of its growing population
p142
aVand feed them,
p143
aVthe sacrificial destruction of its rainforest
p144
aVhas taken place to do so.
p145
aVIt is estimated that the country lost 4.5 million acres of rainforest
p146
aVin one decade alone
p147
aVfrom 2000 until 2010.
p148
aa(lp149
VThis is the Eixample district in Barcelona, Spain.
p150
aVSo the overview perspective can be incredibly helpful
p151
aVto help us understand how cities function
p152
aVand how we can devise smarter solutions for urban planning,
p153
aVand this will become only more relevant
p154
aVas it is expected that 4.9 billion people will live in cities around the world
p155
aVby the year 2030.
p156
aVThis area of Barcelona is characterized by its strict grid pattern,
p157
aVapartments with communal courtyards
p158
aVand these octagonal intersections
p159
aVwhich allow for more sunlight, better ventilation
p160
aVand additional parking at street level.
p161
aa(lp162
VAnd here we see that grid pattern but under much different circumstances.
p163
aVThis is the Dadaab Refugee Camp in northern Kenya,
p164
aVthe largest such facility of its kind in the world.
p165
aVTo cope with the influx of refugees who are fleeing Somalia,
p166
aVwhere there is famine and conflict,
p167
aVthe UN has built this area gridded out at left
p168
aVcalled the LFO extension
p169
aVto house more and more refugees
p170
aVwho are arriving and occupying these white dots,
p171
aVwhich are actually tents
p172
aVwhich will slowly fill up the area over time.
p173
aa(lp174
VSo if you have one of these overviews,
p175
aVyou have a moment in time.
p176
aVIf we have two overviews, however,
p177
aVwe are able to tell stories about changes in time.
p178
aVI call that feature of the project "Juxtapose,"
p179
aVand we'll share a few examples of it with you now.
p180
aa(lp181
VSo the tulip fields in Netherlands bloom every year in April.
p182
aVSo we take an image captured in March a few weeks before
p183
aVand contrast it to one taken a few weeks later.
p184
aVWe're able to watch the flowers bloom in this magnificent cascade of color.
p185
aVIt is estimated that the Dutch produce 4.3 billion tulip bulbs every year.
p186
aa(lp187
VIn 2015, two dams collapsed
p188
aVat an iron ore mine in southeastern Brazil,
p189
aVcausing one of the worst environmental disasters
p190
aVin the history of the country.
p191
aVIt is estimated that 62 million cubic meters of waste
p192
aVwere released when the dams broke,
p193
aVdestroying numerous villages in the process,
p194
aVincluding Bento Rodrigues, seen here before ...
p195
aVand after the flood.
p196
aVUltimately, 19 people were killed in this disaster.
p197
aVHalf a million people did not have access to clean drinking water
p198
aVfor an extended period of time,
p199
aVand the waste soon entered into the Doce River,
p200
aVextended for 650 kilometers
p201
aVall the way into the sea,
p202
aVkilling unknowable amounts of plant and animal life along the way.
p203
aa(lp204
VAnd lastly, here is a story related to the crisis in Syria,
p205
aVa conflict which has claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people
p206
aVand displaced millions.
p207
aVSo this patch of desert is seen in Mafraq, Jordan in 2011,
p208
aVthe year the conflict started,
p209
aVand when we compare it to an image captured just this year in 2017,
p210
aVwe see the construction of the Zaatari refugee camp.
p211
aa(lp212
VSo just as the astronauts of Apollo 8
p213
aVwatched the Earth rising above the lunar landscape for the first time,
p214
aVthere is no way that you could have imagined
p215
aVwhat the places I just showed you look like from outer space.
p216
aVAnd while you may enjoy the aesthetics of an image,
p217
aVonce you learn exactly what it is you're seeing,
p218
aVyou may struggle with the fact that you still like it.
p219
aVAnd that's the tension I want to create with my work,
p220
aVbecause I believe it is that contemplation,
p221
aVthat internal dialogue
p222
aVthat will lead to greater interest in our planet
p223
aVand more awareness of what we're doing to it.
p224
aa(lp225
VI believe that viewing the Earth from the overview perspective
p226
aVis more important now than ever before.
p227
aVThrough the incredible technology of these high-flying cameras,
p228
aVwe can see, monitor and expose
p229
aVthe unprecedented impact that we are having.
p230
aVAnd whether we are scientists
p231
aVor engineers or policymakers
p232
aVor investors or artists,
p233
aVif we can adopt a more expansive perspective,
p234
aVembrace the truth of what is going on
p235
aVand contemplate the long-term health of our planet,
p236
aVwe will create a better
p237
aVand safer and smarter future
p238
aVfor our one and only home.
p239
aa(lp240
