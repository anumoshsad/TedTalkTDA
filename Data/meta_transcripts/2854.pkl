VWhy do people deliberately destroy cultural heritage?
p4
aVBy doing so,
p5
aVdo they believe they're erasing our history?
p6
aVOur cultural memory?
p7
aVIt's true that we are losing cultural heritage to erosion
p8
aVand natural disasters,
p9
aVbut this is something that is simply difficult to avoid.
p10
aVI'm here to show you today how we can use pictures \u2014
p11
aVyour pictures \u2014
p12
aVto reclaim the history that is being lost
p13
aVusing innovative technology
p14
aVand the effort of volunteers.
p15
aa(lp16
VIn the early 20th century,
p17
aVarchaeologists discovered hundreds of statues and artifacts
p18
aVat the ancient city of Hatra,
p19
aVin northern Iraq.
p20
aVStatues like this one were found in fragments,
p21
aVsome of them missing their heads or arms,
p22
aVyet the clothing that they are wearing
p23
aVand their pose
p24
aVcan still tell us their story.
p25
aVFor example,
p26
aVwe believe that by wearing a knee-length tunic
p27
aVand open bare feet,
p28
aVthis was representative of a priest.
p29
aVHowever, with a closer look at this particular piece,
p30
aVwe can see that this tunic being worn was elaborately decorated,
p31
aVwhich has led many researchers to believe
p32
aVthis was actually a statue of a king performing his religious functions.
p33
aa(lp34
VWhen the Mosul Cultural Museum opened in 1952 in northern Iraq,
p35
aVthis statue, as well as others,
p36
aVwere placed there to preserve them for future generations.
p37
aVFollowing the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003,
p38
aVa few statues and artifacts were relocated to Baghdad,
p39
aVbut this statue remained.
p40
aVThen in February of last year, a video was released,
p41
aVand it instantly went viral.
p42
aVMaybe some of you remember seeing it.
p43
aVHere's a short clip.
p44
aa(lp45
V(Video) (Singing in Arabic)
p46
aa(lp47
V(Singing ends)
p48
aa(lp49
VNot a very pleasant sight, right?
p50
aVDid you notice anything familiar in the video?
p51
aVThere it is.
p52
aVThere is that very statue,
p53
aVas it was toppled over,
p54
aVbreaking into pieces.
p55
aa(lp56
VWhen Matthew Vincent and I saw this video,
p57
aVwe were shocked.
p58
aVSince we are archaeologists using innovative technology
p59
aVfor digital preservation,
p60
aVan idea sprung to mind.
p61
aVMaybe we can crowdsource the images that were taken of these artifacts
p62
aVbefore they were destroyed,
p63
aVto create digital reconstructions.
p64
aVIf we can do that,
p65
aVmaybe we can put them into a virtual museum
p66
aVto tell that story.
p67
aVAnd so two weeks after we saw this video,
p68
aVwe started the project called Project Mosul.
p69
aa(lp70
VRemember the pictures of the statue I showed you before?
p71
aVThis is actually the crowdsourced reconstruction of it
p72
aVbefore it was destroyed.
p73
aVNow, many of you may be wondering,
p74
aVhow exactly does this work?
p75
aVWell, the key to this technology is called photogrammetry,
p76
aVand it was invented here, in Germany.
p77
aVIt is the technology that allows us to use two-dimensional images
p78
aVtaken of the same object from different angles
p79
aVto create a 3D model.
p80
aVI know you may be thinking this sounds like magic \u2014 but it's not.
p81
aVLet me show you how it works.
p82
aVHere are two crowdsourced images of the same statue.
p83
aVWhat the computer can do
p84
aVis it can detect similar features between the photographs \u2014
p85
aVsimilar features of the object.
p86
aVThen, by using multiple photos,
p87
aVin this case, it can begin to reconstruct the object in 3D.
p88
aVIn this case,
p89
aVyou have the position of the cameras when each image was taken,
p90
aVshown in blue.
p91
aa(lp92
VNow, this is a partial reconstruction, I admit,
p93
aVbut why would I say partial?
p94
aVWell, simply because the statue was positioned against a wall.
p95
aVWe don't have photographs taken of it from the back.
p96
aVIf I wanted to complete a full digital reconstruction of this statue,
p97
aVI would need a proper camera,
p98
aVtripods, proper lighting,
p99
aVbut we simply can't do that with crowdsourced images.
p100
aVThink about it:
p101
aVHow many of you, when you visit a museum,
p102
aVtake photographs of all parts of the statue,
p103
aVeven the back side of it?
p104
aVWell, maybe if some of you find Michelangelo's David interesting,
p105
aVI guess \u2014
p106
aa(lp107
V(Laughter)
p108
aa(lp109
VBut the thing is,
p110
aVif we can find more images of this object,
p111
aVwe can improve the 3D model.
p112
aa(lp113
VWhen we started the project,
p114
aVwe started it with the Mosul Museum in mind.
p115
aVWe figured we may get a few images,
p116
aVsome people interested,
p117
aVmake one or two virtual reconstructions,
p118
aVbut we had no idea that we had sparked something that would grow so quickly.
p119
aVBefore we knew it,
p120
aVwe realized it was obvious:
p121
aVwe could apply this same idea to lost heritage anywhere.
p122
aVAnd so, we decided to change the name of the project to Rekrei.
p123
aVThen, in the summer of last year,
p124
aV"The Economist" magazine's media lab reached out to us.
p125
aVThey asked us,
p126
aV"Hey, would you like us to build a virtual museum
p127
aVto put the reconstructions back inside,
p128
aVto tell the story?"
p129
aVCan you imagine us saying no?
p130
aVOf course not.
p131
aVWe said yes!
p132
aVWe were so excited.
p133
aVThis was exactly the initial dream of that project.
p134
aVAnd so now,
p135
aVany of you can experience RecoVR Mosul on your phone,
p136
aVusing Google Cardboard
p137
aVor a tablet or even YouTube 360.
p138
aa(lp139
VHere is a screenshot from the virtual museum.
p140
aVAnd there it is ...
p141
aVthe partial reconstruction of the statue,
p142
aVas well as the Lion of Mosul,
p143
aVthe first reconstruction completed by our project.
p144
aVAlthough the video doesn't explicitly show the Lion of Mosul being destroyed,
p145
aVwe have many other examples of large artifacts being destroyed
p146
aVthat were simply too large to have been stolen.
p147
aVFor example,
p148
aVthe Gate of Nimrud in northern Iraq.
p149
aVThis is a digital reconstruction from before,
p150
aVand this is actually during the destruction.
p151
aVOr the Lion of Al-L\u0101t, in Palmyra, Syria:
p152
aVbefore ...
p153
aVand after.
p154
aa(lp155
VAlthough virtual reconstructions are primarily the main focus
p156
aVof our project,
p157
aVsome people have been asking the question:
p158
aVCan we print them in 3D?
p159
aVWe believe 3D printing doesn't offer a straightforward solution
p160
aVto lost heritage.
p161
aVOnce an object is destroyed,
p162
aVit's gone.
p163
aVBut 3D printing does offer an addition to tell that story.
p164
aVFor example, I can show you here ...
p165
aVThere is the statue from Hatra
p166
aVand the Lion of Mosul.
p167
aa(lp168
V(Applause)
p169
aa(lp170
VThank you.
p171
aa(lp172
VNow, if you look closely,
p173
aVyou'll notice that there are some parts that have been printed in color,
p174
aVand some parts that are in white or gray.
p175
aVThis part was added simply to hold the statues up.
p176
aVThis works the same way if you visit a museum,
p177
aVand a statue is found in fragments;
p178
aVit's put together for the people to see it.
p179
aVThis makes sense, right?
p180
aVHowever, we're much more interested
p181
aVin what virtual reality has to offer for lost heritage.
p182
aa(lp183
VHere is an example of one of the tower tombs
p184
aVthat was destroyed in Palmyra.
p185
aVUsing Sketchfab's online viewer,
p186
aVwe can show that we have reconstructed three parts of the exterior of the tomb,
p187
aVbut we also have photos of the inside,
p188
aVso we're beginning to create a reconstruction of the wall
p189
aVand the ceiling.
p190
aVArchaeologists worked there for many, many years,
p191
aVso we also have architectural drawing plans of this lost heritage.
p192
aa(lp193
VUnfortunately, we are not only losing cultural heritage to areas of conflict
p194
aVand at war \u2014
p195
aVwe're also losing it to natural disasters.
p196
aVThis is a 3D model of Durbar Square in Kathmandu,
p197
aVbefore the earthquake that occurred last April ...
p198
aVand this is after.
p199
aVYou may be thinking,
p200
aVyou didn't create these 3D models with only tourist photographs,
p201
aVand that's true.
p202
aVBut what this represents
p203
aVis the ability for large, public organizations and private industry
p204
aVto come together for initiatives like ours.
p205
aa(lp206
VAnd so one of the major challenges of our project, really,
p207
aVis to find photographs that were taken before something happens, right?
p208
aVWell, the internet is basically a database with millions of images, right?
p209
aVExactly.
p210
aVSo we have begun to develop a tool
p211
aVthat allows us to extract images from websites like Flickr,
p212
aVbased on their geotags,
p213
aVto complete reconstructions.
p214
aa(lp215
VBecause we're not only losing cultural heritage to natural disasters and in war,
p216
aVbut we're also losing it to something else.
p217
aVAny idea, just looking at these two pictures?
p218
aVMaybe it's a little difficult to remember,
p219
aVbut only a few weeks ago,
p220
aVthis was the example of human destruction by human stupidity.
p221
aVBecause a tourist in Lisbon wanted to climb onto this statue
p222
aVand take a selfie with it \u2014
p223
aa(lp224
V(Laughter)
p225
aa(lp226
Vand pulled it down with him.
p227
aVSo we're already finding photographs
p228
aVto complete a digital reconstruction of this.
p229
aa(lp230
VWe need to remember
p231
aVthat the destruction of cultural heritage isn't a recent phenomenon.
p232
aVIn the 16th century,
p233
aVEuropean priests and explorers burned thousands of Maya books in the Americas,
p234
aVof which we only have a handful left.
p235
aVFast-forward to 2001,
p236
aVwhen the Taliban blew up the Bamiyan Buddhas in Afghanistan.
p237
aa(lp238
VYou see,
p239
aVcultural heritage is about our shared global history.
p240
aVIt helps us connect with our ancestors and their stories,
p241
aVbut we're losing pieces of it every day to natural disasters
p242
aVand in areas of conflict.
p243
aVOf course, the loss of human life is the most heartbreaking loss ...
p244
aVbut cultural heritage offers us a way to preserve the memory of the people
p245
aVfor future generations.
p246
aVWe need your help to reclaim the history that is being lost.
p247
aVWill you join us?
