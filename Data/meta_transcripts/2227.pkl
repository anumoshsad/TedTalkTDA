VWe're at a tipping point in human history,
p4
aVa species poised between gaining the stars and losing the planet we call home.
p5
aa(lp6
VEven in just the past few years, we've greatly expanded
p7
aVour knowledge of how Earth fits within the context of our universe.
p8
aVNASA's Kepler mission has discovered
p9
aVthousands of potential planets around other stars,
p10
aVindicating that Earth is but one of billions of planets in our galaxy.
p11
aVKepler is a space telescope
p12
aVthat measures the subtle dimming of stars as planets pass in front of them,
p13
aVblocking just a little bit of that light from reaching us.
p14
aVKepler's data reveals planets' sizes
p15
aVas well as their distance from their parent star.
p16
aVTogether, this helps us understand whether these planets are small and rocky,
p17
aVlike the terrestrial planets in our own Solar System,
p18
aVand also how much light they receive from their parent sun.
p19
aVIn turn, this provides clues as to whether these planets that we discover
p20
aVmight be habitable or not.
p21
aa(lp22
VUnfortunately, at the same time as we're discovering this treasure trove
p23
aVof potentially habitable worlds,
p24
aVour own planet is sagging under the weight of humanity.
p25
aV2014 was the hottest year on record.
p26
aVGlaciers and sea ice that have been with us for millennia
p27
aVare now disappearing in a matter of decades.
p28
aVThese planetary-scale environmental  changes that we have set in motion
p29
aVare rapidly outpacing our ability to alter their course.
p30
aa(lp31
VBut I'm not a climate scientist, I'm an astronomer.
p32
aVI study planetary habitability as influenced by stars
p33
aVwith the hopes of finding the places in the universe
p34
aVwhere we might discover life beyond our own planet.
p35
aVYou could say that I look for choice alien real estate.
p36
aa(lp37
VNow, as somebody who is deeply embedded in the search for life in the universe,
p38
aVI can tell you that the more you look for planets like Earth,
p39
aVthe more you appreciate our own planet itself.
p40
aVEach one of these new worlds invites a comparison
p41
aVbetween the newly discovered planet and the planets we know best:
p42
aVthose of our own Solar System.
p43
aa(lp44
VConsider our neighbor, Mars.
p45
aVMars is small and rocky, and though it's a bit far from the Sun,
p46
aVit might be considered a potentially habitable world
p47
aVif found by a mission like Kepler.
p48
aVIndeed, it's possible that Mars was habitable in the past,
p49
aVand in part, this is why we study Mars so much.
p50
aVOur rovers, like Curiosity, crawl across its surface,
p51
aVscratching for clues as to the origins of life as we know it.
p52
aVOrbiters like the MAVEN mission sample the Martian atmosphere,
p53
aVtrying to understand how Mars might have lost its past habitability.
p54
aVPrivate spaceflight companies now offer not just a short trip to near space
p55
aVbut the tantalizing possibility of living our lives on Mars.
p56
aa(lp57
VBut though these Martian vistas
p58
aVresemble the deserts of our own home world,
p59
aVplaces that are tied in our imagination to ideas about pioneering and frontiers,
p60
aVcompared to Earth
p61
aVMars is a pretty terrible place to live.
p62
aVConsider the extent to which we have not colonized
p63
aVthe deserts of our own planet,
p64
aVplaces that are lush by comparison with Mars.
p65
aVEven in the driest, highest places on Earth,
p66
aVthe air is sweet and thick with oxygen
p67
aVexhaled from thousands of miles away by our rainforests.
p68
aa(lp69
VI worry \u2014 I worry that this excitement about colonizing Mars and other planets
p70
aVcarries with it a long, dark shadow:
p71
aVthe implication and belief by some
p72
aVthat Mars will be there to save us from the self-inflicted destruction
p73
aVof the only truly habitable planet we know of, the Earth.
p74
aVAs much as I love interplanetary exploration,
p75
aVI deeply disagree with this idea.
p76
aVThere are many excellent reasons to go to Mars,
p77
aVbut for anyone to tell you that Mars will be there to back up humanity
p78
aVis like the captain of the Titanic telling you that the real party
p79
aVis happening later on the lifeboats.
p80
aV(Laughter)
p81
aV(Applause)
p82
aa(lp83
VThank you.
p84
aa(lp85
VBut the goals of interplanetary exploration and planetary preservation
p86
aVare not opposed to one another.
p87
aVNo, they're in fact two sides of the same goal:
p88
aVto understand, preserve and improve life into the future.
p89
aVThe extreme environments of our own world are alien vistas.
p90
aVThey're just closer to home.
p91
aVIf we can understand how to create and maintain habitable spaces
p92
aVout of hostile, inhospitable spaces here on Earth,
p93
aVperhaps we can meet the needs of both preserving our own environment
p94
aVand moving beyond it.
p95
aa(lp96
VI leave you with a final thought experiment:
p97
aVFermi's paradox.
p98
aVMany years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi asked that, given the fact
p99
aVthat our universe has been around for a very long time
p100
aVand we expect that there are many planets within it,
p101
aVwe should have found evidence for alien life by now.
p102
aVSo where are they?
p103
aVWell, one possible solution to Fermi's paradox
p104
aVis that, as civilizations become technologically advanced enough
p105
aVto consider living amongst the stars,
p106
aVthey lose sight of how important it is
p107
aVto safeguard the home worlds that fostered that advancement to begin with.
p108
aVIt is hubris to believe that interplanetary colonization alone
p109
aVwill save us from ourselves,
p110
aVbut planetary preservation and interplanetary exploration
p111
aVcan work together.
p112
aa(lp113
VIf we truly believe in our ability
p114
aVto bend the hostile environments of Mars for human habitation,
p115
aVthen we should be able to surmount the far easier task of preserving
p116
aVthe habitability of the Earth.
p117
