VYou know, cadaver dissection
p4
aVis the traditional way of learning human anatomy.
p5
aVFor students, it's quite an experience,
p6
aVbut for a school, it could be very difficult
p7
aVor expensive to maintain.
p8
aVSo we learned the majority of anatomic classes taught,
p9
aVthey do not have a cadaver dissection lab.
p10
aVMaybe those reasons, or depending on where you are,
p11
aVcadavers may not be easily available.
p12
aa(lp13
VSo to address this, we developed
p14
aVwith a Dr. Brown in Stanford: virtual dissection table.
p15
aVSo we call this Anatomage Table.
p16
aVSo with this Anatomage Table,
p17
aVstudents can experience
p18
aVthe dissection without a human cadaver.
p19
aVAnd the table form is important,
p20
aVand since it's touch-interactive,
p21
aVjust like the way they do dissections in the lab,
p22
aVor furthermore just the way a surgeon operates on a patient
p23
aVyou can literally interact with your table.
p24
aVOur digital body is one-to-one life size,
p25
aVso this is exactly the way
p26
aVstudents will see the real anatomy.
p27
aa(lp28
VI'm going to
p29
aVdo some demonstrations.
p30
aVAs you can see,
p31
aVI use my finger to interact with my digital body.
p32
aVI'm going to do some cuts.
p33
aVI can cut any way I want to, so I cut right here.
p34
aVThen it's going to show inside.
p35
aVAnd I can change my cut
p36
aVto see different parts.
p37
aVMaybe I can cut there,
p38
aVsee the brain,
p39
aVand I can change my cut.
p40
aVYou can see some internal organs.
p41
aVSo we call this
p42
aVthe slicer mode.
p43
aVOK, I'm going to do another cut.
p44
aVRight there.
p45
aVThis shows a lot of internal structures.
p46
aVSo if I want to see the back side,
p47
aVI can flip
p48
aVand see from behind.
p49
aVLike this.
p50
aVSo if these images are
p51
aVuncomfortable to you or disturbing to you,
p52
aVthat means we did the right job.
p53
aVSo our doctors said
p54
aVthese are eye candies.
p55
aa(lp56
VSo instead of just butchering the body,
p57
aVI'd like to do more clinically meaningful dissections.
p58
aVWhat I'm going to do is
p59
aVI'm going to peel off all the skin, muscles and bones,
p60
aVjust to see a few internal organs.
p61
aVRight here.
p62
aVLet's say I'm going to cut
p63
aVthe liver right here.
p64
aVOK.
p65
aVLet's say I'm interested in looking at the heart.
p66
aVI'm going to do some surgery here.
p67
aVI'm going to cut some veins, arteries.
p68
aVOops! ...
p69
aa(lp70
VYou don't want to hear "oops" in real surgery.
p71
aV(Laughter)
p72
aVBut fortunately, our digital man has "undo."
p73
aV(Laughter)
p74
aVOkay.
p75
aa(lp76
VAll right then.
p77
aVLet me zoom in.
p78
aVI'm going to make a cut right there.
p79
aVAnd then you can see the inside of the heart.
p80
aVYou can see the atrium and the ventricles,
p81
aVhow blood flows to our arteries and veins.
p82
aVJust like this,
p83
aVstudents can isolate anybody
p84
aVand dissect any way you want to.
p85
aVIt doesn't have to be always dissection.
p86
aVSince it's digital, we can do reverse dissection.
p87
aVSo let me show you,
p88
aVI'm going to start with the skeletal structure,
p89
aVand I can add a few internal organs.
p90
aVYep.
p91
aVMaybe I can add quickly this way.
p92
aVAnd I can build muscles
p93
aVgradually,
p94
aVjust like that.
p95
aVWe can see tendons and muscles.
p96
aVWish I could build my muscle this fast.
p97
aV(Laughter)
p98
aVAnd this is another way to learn anatomy.
p99
aa(lp100
VAnother thing I can show you is,
p101
aVmore often than not,
p102
aVdoctors get to meet patients
p103
aVin X-ray form.
p104
aVSo,
p105
aVAnatomage Table shows
p106
aVexactly how the anatomy will appear in X-ray.
p107
aVYou can also interact with your X-ray,
p108
aVand also if you want,
p109
aVyou can compare
p110
aVwith how anatomy would appear
p111
aVin X-ray, too.
p112
aVSo when you are done,
p113
aVjust bring back the body
p114
aVand then it's ready for another session.
p115
aVIt looks like our table
p116
aValso can transform gender, too.
p117
aVIt's a female now.
p118
aa(lp119
VSo this is Anatomage Table. Thank you.
