VHello, TEDWomen, what's up.
p4
aa(lp5
V(Cheering)
p6
aa(lp7
VNot good enough.
p8
aVHello, TEDWomen, what is up?
p9
aa(lp10
V(Loud cheering)
p11
aa(lp12
VMy name is Maysoon Zayid,
p13
aVand I am not drunk,
p14
aVbut the doctor who delivered me was.
p15
aVHe cut my mom six different times
p16
aVin six different directions,
p17
aVsuffocating poor little me in the process.
p18
aVAs a result, I have cerebral palsy,
p19
aVwhich means I shake all the time.
p20
aVLook.
p21
aVIt's exhausting.
p22
aVI'm like Shakira, Shakira meets Muhammad Ali.
p23
aa(lp24
V(Laughter)
p25
aa(lp26
VCP is not genetic.
p27
aVIt's not a birth defect. You can't catch it.
p28
aVNo one put a curse on my mother's uterus,
p29
aVand I didn't get it because my parents are first cousins,
p30
aVwhich they are.
p31
aa(lp32
V(Laughter)
p33
aa(lp34
VIt only happens from accidents,
p35
aVlike what happened to me on my birth day.
p36
aa(lp37
VNow, I must warn you,
p38
aVI'm not inspirational.
p39
aa(lp40
V(Laughter)
p41
aa(lp42
VAnd I don't want anyone in this room to feel bad for me,
p43
aVbecause at some point in your life,
p44
aVyou have dreamt of being disabled.
p45
aVCome on a journey with me.
p46
aVIt's Christmas Eve, you're at the mall,
p47
aVyou're driving around in circles looking for parking,
p48
aVand what do you see?
p49
aVSixteen empty handicapped spaces.
p50
aa(lp51
V(Laughter)
p52
aa(lp53
VAnd you're like, "God, can't I just be a little disabled?"
p54
aa(lp55
V(Laughter)
p56
aa(lp57
VAlso, I've got to tell you,
p58
aVI've got 99 problems, and palsy is just one.
p59
aa(lp60
V(Laughter)
p61
aa(lp62
VIf there was an Oppression Olympics,
p63
aVI would win the gold medal.
p64
aVI'm Palestinian, Muslim,
p65
aVI'm female, I'm disabled,
p66
aVand I live in New Jersey.
p67
aa(lp68
V(Laughter)
p69
aa(lp70
V(Applause)
p71
aa(lp72
VIf you don't feel better about yourself, maybe you should.
p73
aa(lp74
V(Laughter)
p75
aa(lp76
VCliffside Park, New Jersey is my hometown.
p77
aVI have always loved the fact
p78
aVthat my hood and my affliction share the same initials.
p79
aVI also love the fact
p80
aVthat if I wanted to walk from my house to New York City, I could.
p81
aa(lp82
VA lot of people with CP don't walk,
p83
aVbut my parents didn't believe in "can't."
p84
aVMy father's mantra was,
p85
aV"You can do it, yes you can can."
p86
aa(lp87
V(Laughter)
p88
aVSo, if my three older sisters were mopping,
p89
aVI was mopping.
p90
aVIf my three older sisters went to public school,
p91
aVmy parents would sue the school system
p92
aVand guarantee that I went too,
p93
aVand if we didn't all get A's,
p94
aVwe all got my mother's slipper.
p95
aa(lp96
V(Laughter)
p97
aa(lp98
VMy father taught me how to walk when I was five years old
p99
aVby placing my heels on his feet
p100
aVand just walking.
p101
aVAnother tactic that he used
p102
aVis he would dangle a dollar bill in front of me
p103
aVand have me chase it.
p104
aa(lp105
V(Laughter)
p106
aa(lp107
VMy inner stripper was very strong.
p108
aa(lp109
V(Laughter)
p110
aa(lp111
VYeah.
p112
aVNo, by the first day of kindergarten,
p113
aVI was walking like a champ
p114
aVwho had been punched one too many times.
p115
aa(lp116
V(Laughter)
p117
aa(lp118
VGrowing up, there were only six Arabs in my town,
p119
aVand they were all my family.
p120
aa(lp121
V(Laughter)
p122
aa(lp123
VNow there are 20 Arabs in town,
p124
aVand they are still all my family.
p125
aa(lp126
V(Laughter)
p127
aa(lp128
VI don't think anyone even noticed we weren't Italian.
p129
aa(lp130
V(Laughter)
p131
aa(lp132
V(Applause)
p133
aa(lp134
VThis was before 9/11
p135
aVand before politicians thought it was appropriate
p136
aVto use "I hate Muslims" as a campaign slogan.
p137
aVThe people that I grew up with had no problem with my faith.
p138
aVThey did, however, seem very concerned
p139
aVthat I would starve to death during Ramadan.
p140
aVI would explain to them that I have enough fat
p141
aVto live off of for three whole months,
p142
aVso fasting from sunrise to sunset is a piece of cake.
p143
aa(lp144
V(Laughter)
p145
aa(lp146
VI have tap-danced on Broadway.
p147
aVYeah, on Broadway. It's crazy.
p148
aa(lp149
V(Applause)
p150
aa(lp151
VMy parents couldn't afford physical therapy,
p152
aVso they sent me to dancing school.
p153
aVI learned how to dance in heels,
p154
aVwhich means I can walk in heels.
p155
aVAnd I'm from Jersey,
p156
aVand we are really concerned with being chic,
p157
aVso if my friends wore heels, so did I.
p158
aa(lp159
VAnd when my friends went and spent their summer vacations
p160
aVon the Jersey Shore, I did not.
p161
aVI spent my summers in a war zone,
p162
aVbecause my parents were afraid
p163
aVthat if we didn't go back to Palestine every single summer,
p164
aVwe'd grow up to be Madonna.
p165
aa(lp166
V(Laughter)
p167
aa(lp168
VSummer vacations often consisted of my father trying to heal me,
p169
aVso I drank deer's milk,
p170
aVI had hot cups on my back,
p171
aVI was dunked in the Dead Sea,
p172
aVand I remember the water burning my eyes
p173
aVand thinking, "It's working! It's working!"
p174
aa(lp175
V(Laughter)
p176
aa(lp177
VBut one miracle cure we did find was yoga.
p178
aVI have to tell you, it's very boring,
p179
aVbut before I did yoga,
p180
aVI was a stand-up comedian who can't stand up.
p181
aVAnd now I can stand on my head.
p182
aVMy parents reinforced this notion
p183
aVthat I could do anything,
p184
aVthat no dream was impossible,
p185
aVand my dream was to be
p186
aVon the daytime soap opera "General Hospital."
p187
aa(lp188
V(Laughter)
p189
aa(lp190
VI went to college during affirmative action
p191
aVand got a sweet scholarship to ASU,
p192
aVArizona State University,
p193
aVbecause I fit every single quota.
p194
aa(lp195
V(Laughter)
p196
aa(lp197
VI was like the pet lemur of the theater department.
p198
aVEverybody loved me.
p199
aVI did all the less-than-intelligent kids' homework,
p200
aVI got A's in all of my classes,
p201
aVA's in all of their classes.
p202
aa(lp203
V(Laughter)
p204
aa(lp205
VEvery time I did a scene from "The Glass Menagerie,"
p206
aVmy professors would weep.
p207
aVBut I never got cast.
p208
aVFinally, my senior year,
p209
aVASU decided to do a show called "They Dance Real Slow in Jackson."
p210
aVIt's a play about a girl with CP.
p211
aVI was a girl with CP.
p212
aVSo I start shouting from the rooftops,
p213
aV"I'm finally going to get a part!
p214
aVI have cerebral palsy!
p215
aVFree at last! Free at last!
p216
aVThank God almighty, I'm free at last!"
p217
aVI didn't get the part.
p218
aa(lp219
V(Laughter)
p220
aa(lp221
VSherry Brown got the part.
p222
aVI went racing to the head of the theater department
p223
aVcrying hysterically, like someone shot my cat,
p224
aVto ask her why,
p225
aVand she said it was because they didn't think I could do the stunts.
p226
aVI said, "Excuse me, if I can't do the stunts,
p227
aVneither can the character."
p228
aa(lp229
V(Laughter)
p230
aa(lp231
V(Applause)
p232
aa(lp233
VThis was a part that I was literally born to play
p234
aVthey gave it to a non-palsy actress.
p235
aVCollege was imitating life.
p236
aVHollywood has a sordid history
p237
aVof casting able-bodied actors to play disabled onscreen.
p238
aa(lp239
VUpon graduating, I moved back home,
p240
aVand my first acting gig was as an extra on a daytime soap opera.
p241
aVMy dream was coming true.
p242
aVAnd I knew that I would be promoted
p243
aVfrom "Diner Diner" to "Wacky Best Friend" in no time.
p244
aa(lp245
V(Laughter)
p246
aa(lp247
VBut instead, I remained a glorified piece of furniture
p248
aVthat you could only recognize from the back of my head,
p249
aVand it became clear to me
p250
aVthat casting directors
p251
aVdidn't hire fluffy, ethnic, disabled actors.
p252
aVThey only hired perfect people.
p253
aVBut there were exceptions to the rule.
p254
aVI grew up watching Whoopi Goldberg,
p255
aVRoseanne Barr, Ellen,
p256
aVand all of these women had one thing in common:
p257
aVthey were comedians.
p258
aVSo I became a comic.
p259
aa(lp260
V(Laughter)
p261
aa(lp262
V(Applause)
p263
aa(lp264
VMy first gig was driving famous comics
p265
aVfrom New York City to shows in New Jersey,
p266
aVand I'll never forget the face of the first comic I ever drove
p267
aVwhen he realized that he was speeding down the New Jersey Turnpike
p268
aVwith a chick with CP driving him.
p269
aa(lp270
V(Laughter)
p271
aa(lp272
VI've performed in clubs all over America,
p273
aVand I've also performed in Arabic in the Middle East,
p274
aVuncensored and uncovered.
p275
aa(lp276
V(Laughter)
p277
aa(lp278
VSome people say I'm the first stand-up comic in the Arab world.
p279
aVI never like to claim first,
p280
aVbut I do know that they never heard
p281
aVthat nasty little rumor that women aren't funny,
p282
aVand they find us hysterical.
p283
aa(lp284
V(Laughter)
p285
aa(lp286
VIn 2003, my brother from another mother and father
p287
aVDean Obeidallah and I started
p288
aVthe New York Arab-American Comedy Festival,
p289
aVnow in its 10th year.
p290
aVOur goal was to change the negative image of Arab-Americans in media,
p291
aVwhile also reminding casting directors
p292
aVthat South Asian and Arab are not synonymous.
p293
aa(lp294
V(Laughter)
p295
aa(lp296
VMainstreaming Arabs was much, much easier
p297
aVthan conquering the challenge against the stigma against disability.
p298
aa(lp299
VMy big break came in 2010.
p300
aVI was invited to be a guest on the cable news show
p301
aV"Countdown with Keith Olbermann."
p302
aVI walked in looking like I was going to the prom,
p303
aVand they shuffle me into a studio
p304
aVand seat me on a spinning, rolling chair.
p305
aa(lp306
V(Laughter)
p307
aa(lp308
VSo I looked at the stage manager
p309
aVand I'm like, "Excuse me, can I have another chair?"
p310
aVAnd she looked at me and she went,
p311
aV"Five, four, three, two ..."
p312
aVAnd we were live, right?
p313
aVSo I had to grip onto the anchor's desk
p314
aVso that I wouldn't roll off the screen during the segment,
p315
aVand when the interview was over, I was livid.
p316
aVI had finally gotten my chance and I blew it,
p317
aVand I knew I would never get invited back.
p318
aVBut not only did Mr. Olbermann invite me back,
p319
aVhe made me a full-time contributor,
p320
aVand he taped down my chair.
p321
aa(lp322
V(Laughter)
p323
aa(lp324
V(Applause)
p325
aa(lp326
VOne fun fact I learned while on the air with Keith Olbermann
p327
aVwas that humans on the Internet are scumbags.
p328
aa(lp329
V(Laughter)
p330
aVPeople say children are cruel,
p331
aVbut I was never made fun of as a child or an adult.
p332
aVSuddenly, my disability on the world wide web is fair game.
p333
aVI would look at clips online and see comments like,
p334
aV"Yo, why's she tweakin'?"
p335
aV"Yo, is she retarded?"
p336
aVAnd my favorite, "Poor Gumby-mouth terrorist.
p337
aVWhat does she suffer from?
p338
aVWe should really pray for her."
p339
aVOne commenter even suggested that I add my disability to my credits:
p340
aVscreenwriter, comedian, palsy.
p341
aa(lp342
VDisability is as visual as race.
p343
aVIf a wheelchair user can't play Beyoncé,
p344
aVthen Beyoncé can't play a wheelchair user.
p345
aVThe disabled are the largest \u2014
p346
aVYeah, clap for that, man. Come on.
p347
aa(lp348
V(Applause)
p349
aa(lp350
VPeople with disabilities are the largest minority in the world,
p351
aVand we are the most underrepresented in entertainment.
p352
aa(lp353
VThe doctors said that I wouldn't walk,
p354
aVbut I am here in front of you.
p355
aVHowever, if I grew up with social media,
p356
aVI don't think I would be.
p357
aVI hope that together,
p358
aVwe can create more positive images
p359
aVof disability in the media and in everyday life.
p360
aVPerhaps if there were more positive images,
p361
aVit would foster less hate on the Internet.
p362
aVOr maybe not.
p363
aVMaybe it still takes a village to teach our children well.
p364
aa(lp365
VMy crooked journey has taken me to some very spectacular places.
p366
aVI got to walk the red carpet
p367
aVflanked by soap diva Susan Lucci
p368
aVand the iconic Loreen Arbus.
p369
aVI got to act in a movie with Adam Sandler
p370
aVand work with my idol, the amazing Dave Matthews.
p371
aVI toured the world as a headliner on Arabs Gone Wild.
p372
aVI was a delegate representing the great state of New Jersey
p373
aVat the 2008 DNC.
p374
aVAnd I founded Maysoon's Kids,
p375
aVa charity that hopes to give Palestinian refugee children
p376
aVa sliver of the chance my parents gave me.
p377
aVBut the one moment that stands out the most
p378
aVwas when I got \u2014 before this moment \u2014
p379
aa(lp380
V(Laughter)
p381
aa(lp382
V(Applause)
p383
aa(lp384
VBut the one moment that stands out the most
p385
aVwas when I got to perform
p386
aVfor the man who floats like a butterfly
p387
aVand stings like a bee,
p388
aVhas Parkinson's and shakes just like me,
p389
aVMuhammad Ali.
p390
aa(lp391
V(Applause)
p392
aa(lp393
V(Applause ends)
p394
aa(lp395
VIt was the only time that my father ever saw me perform live,
p396
aVand I dedicate this talk to his memory.
p397
aa(lp398
V(Arabic) Allah yerhamak yaba.
p399
aa(lp400
V(English) My name is Maysoon Zayid,
p401
aVand if I can can, you can can.
