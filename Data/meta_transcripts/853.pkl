VWe invent.
p4
aVMy company invents
p5
aVall kinds of new technology
p6
aVin lots of different areas.
p7
aVAnd we do that for a couple of reasons.
p8
aVWe invent for fun \u2014
p9
aVinvention is a lot of fun to do \u2014
p10
aVand we also invent for profit.
p11
aVThe two are related because
p12
aVthe profit actually takes long enough that if it isn't fun,
p13
aVyou wouldn't have the time to do it.
p14
aVSo we do this
p15
aVfun and profit-oriented inventing
p16
aVfor most of what we do,
p17
aVbut we also have a program where we invent for humanity \u2014
p18
aVwhere we take some of our best inventors,
p19
aVand we say, "Are there problems
p20
aVwhere we have a good idea for solving a problem the world has?" \u2014
p21
aVand to solve it in the way we try to solve problems,
p22
aVwhich is with dramatic, crazy,
p23
aVout-of-the-box solutions.
p24
aVBill Gates is one of those smartest guys of ours
p25
aVthat work on these problems
p26
aVand he also funds this work, so thank you.
p27
aVSo I'm going to briefly discuss
p28
aVa couple of problems that we have
p29
aVand a couple of problems where
p30
aVwe've got some solutions underway.
p31
aa(lp32
VVaccination is one of the
p33
aVkey techniques in public health,
p34
aVa fantastic thing.
p35
aVBut in the developing world a lot of vaccines
p36
aVspoil before they're administered,
p37
aVand that's because they need to be kept cold.
p38
aVAlmost all vaccines need to be kept at refrigerator temperatures.
p39
aVThey go bad very quickly if you don't,
p40
aVand if you don't have stable power grid, this doesn't happen,
p41
aVso kids die.
p42
aVIt's not just the loss of the vaccine that matters;
p43
aVit's the fact that those kids don't get vaccinated.
p44
aVThis is one of the ways that
p45
aVvaccines are carried:
p46
aVThese are Styrofoam chests. These are being carried by people,
p47
aVbut they're also put on the backs of pickup trucks.
p48
aVWe've got a different solution.
p49
aVNow, one of these Styrofoam chests
p50
aVwill last for about four hours with ice in it.
p51
aa(lp52
VAnd we thought, well, that's not really good enough.
p53
aVSo we made this thing.
p54
aVThis lasts six months with no power;
p55
aVabsolutely zero power,
p56
aVbecause it loses less
p57
aVthan a half a watt.
p58
aVNow, this is our second generations prototype.
p59
aVThe third generation prototype is, right now,
p60
aVin Uganda being tested.
p61
aVNow, the reason we were able to come up with this
p62
aVis two key ideas:
p63
aVOne is that this is similar to a cryogenic Dewar,
p64
aVsomething you'd keep liquid nitrogen or liquid helium in.
p65
aVThey have incredible insulation,
p66
aVso let's put some incredible insulation here.
p67
aVThe other idea is kind of interesting,
p68
aVwhich is, you can't reach inside anymore.
p69
aVBecause if you open it up and reach inside,
p70
aVyou'd let the heat in, the game would be over.
p71
aVSo the inside of this thing actually looks like a Coke machine.
p72
aVIt vends out little individual vials.
p73
aVSo a simple idea,
p74
aVwhich we hope is going to change the way vaccines are distributed
p75
aVin Africa and around the world.
p76
aa(lp77
VWe'll move on to malaria.
p78
aVMalaria is one of the great public health problems.
p79
aVEsther Duflo talked a little bit about this.
p80
aVTwo hundred million people a year.
p81
aVEvery 43 seconds a child in Africa dies;
p82
aV27 will die during my talk.
p83
aVAnd there's no way for us here in this country
p84
aVto grasp really what that means to the people involved.
p85
aVAnother comment of Esther's
p86
aVwas that we react when there's
p87
aVa tragedy like Haiti,
p88
aVbut that tragedy is ongoing.
p89
aVSo what can we do about it?
p90
aVWell, there are a lot of things people have tried
p91
aVfor many years for solving malaria.
p92
aVYou can spray; the problem is there are environmental issues.
p93
aVYou can try to treat people and create awareness.
p94
aVThat's great, except the places that have malaria really bad,
p95
aVthey don't have health care systems.
p96
aVA vaccine would be a terrific thing,
p97
aVonly they don't work yet.
p98
aVPeople have tried for a long time. There are a couple of interesting candidates.
p99
aVIt's a very difficult thing to make a vaccine for.
p100
aVYou can distribute bed nets,
p101
aVand bed nets are very effective if you use them.
p102
aVYou don't always use them for that. People fish with them.
p103
aVThey don't always get to everyone.
p104
aVAnd bed nets
p105
aVhave an effect on the epidemic,
p106
aVbut you're never going to make it extinct with bed nets.
p107
aa(lp108
VNow, malaria is
p109
aVan incredibly complicated disease.
p110
aVWe could spend hours going over this.
p111
aVIt's got this sort of soap opera-like lifestyle;
p112
aVthey have sex, they burrow into your liver,
p113
aVthey tunnel into your blood cells ...
p114
aVit's an incredibly complicated disease,
p115
aVbut that's actually one of the things we find interesting about it
p116
aVand why we work on malaria:
p117
aVThere's a lot of potential ways in.
p118
aVOne of those ways might be better diagnosis.
p119
aVSo we hope this year
p120
aVto prototype each of these devices.
p121
aVOne does an automatic malaria diagnosis
p122
aVin the same way that a diabetic's glucose meter works:
p123
aVYou take a drop of blood,
p124
aVyou put it in there and it automatically tells you.
p125
aVToday, you need to do a complicated laboratory procedure,
p126
aVcreate a bunch of microscope slides
p127
aVand have a trained person examine it.
p128
aa(lp129
VThe other thing is, you know,
p130
aVit would be even better if you didn't have to draw the blood.
p131
aVAnd if you look through the eye,
p132
aVor you look at the vessels on the white of the eye,
p133
aVin fact, you may be able to do this
p134
aVdirectly, without drawing any blood at all,
p135
aVor through your nail beds.
p136
aVBecause if you actually look through your fingernails, you can see blood vessels,
p137
aVand once you see blood vessels, we think we can see the malaria.
p138
aVWe can see it because of this molecule
p139
aVcalled hemozoin.
p140
aVIt's produced by the malaria parasite
p141
aVand it's a very interesting crystalline substance.
p142
aVInteresting, anyway, if you're a solid-state physicist.
p143
aVThere's a lot of cool stuff we can do with it.
p144
aa(lp145
VThis is our femtosecond laser lab.
p146
aVSo this creates pulses of light
p147
aVthat last a femtosecond.
p148
aVThat's really, really, really short.
p149
aVThis is a pulse of light that's
p150
aVonly about one wavelength of light long,
p151
aVso it's a whole bunch of photons
p152
aVall coming and hitting simultaneously.
p153
aVIt creates a very high peak power
p154
aVand it lets you do all kinds of interesting things;
p155
aVin particular, it lets you find hemozoin.
p156
aVSo here's an image of red blood cells,
p157
aVand now we can actually map
p158
aVwhere the hemozoin and where the malaria parasites are
p159
aVinside those red blood cells.
p160
aVAnd using both this technique
p161
aVand other optical techniques,
p162
aVwe think we can make those diagnostics.
p163
aVWe also have another hemozoin-oriented
p164
aVtherapy for malaria:
p165
aVa way, in acute cases, to actually
p166
aVtake the malaria parasite and filter it out of the blood system.
p167
aVSort of like doing dialysis,
p168
aVbut for relieving the parasite load.
p169
aa(lp170
VThis is our thousand-core supercomputer.
p171
aVWe're kind of software guys,
p172
aVand so nearly any problem that you pose,
p173
aVwe like to try to solve with some software.
p174
aVOne of the problems that you have if you're trying to eradicate malaria
p175
aVor reduce it
p176
aVis you don't know what's the most effective thing to do.
p177
aVOkay, we heard about bed nets earlier.
p178
aVYou spend a certain amount per bed net.
p179
aVOr you could spray.
p180
aVYou can give drug administration.
p181
aVThere's all these different interventions
p182
aVbut they have different kinds of effectiveness.
p183
aVHow can you tell?
p184
aVSo we've created, using our supercomputer,
p185
aVthe world's best computer model of malaria,
p186
aVwhich we'll show you now.
p187
aa(lp188
VWe picked Madagascar.
p189
aVWe have every road,
p190
aVevery village,
p191
aVevery, almost, square inch of Madagascar.
p192
aVWe have all of the precipitation data
p193
aVand the temperature data.
p194
aVThat's very important because the humidity and precipitation
p195
aVtell you whether you've got
p196
aVstanding pools of water for the mosquitoes to breed.
p197
aVSo that sets the stage on which you do this.
p198
aVYou then have to introduce the mosquitoes,
p199
aVand you have to model that
p200
aVand how they come and go.
p201
aVUltimately, it gives you this.
p202
aVThis is malaria spreading
p203
aVacross Madagascar.
p204
aVAnd this is this latter part of the rainy season.
p205
aVWe're going to the dry season now.
p206
aVIt nearly goes away in the dry season,
p207
aVbecause there's no place for the mosquitoes to breed.
p208
aVAnd then, of course, the next year it comes roaring back.
p209
aVBy doing these kinds of simulations,
p210
aVwe want to eradicate or control malaria
p211
aVthousands of times in software
p212
aVbefore we actually have to do it in real life;
p213
aVto be able to simulate both the economic trade-offs \u2014
p214
aVhow many bed nets versus how much spraying? \u2014
p215
aVor the social trade-offs \u2014
p216
aVwhat happens if unrest breaks out?
p217
aa(lp218
VWe also try to study our foe.
p219
aVThis is a high-speed camera view
p220
aVof a mosquito.
p221
aVAnd, in a moment,
p222
aVwe're going to see a view of the airflow.
p223
aVHere, we're trying to visualize the airflow
p224
aVaround the wings of the mosquito
p225
aVwith little particles we're illuminating with a laser.
p226
aVBy understanding how mosquitoes fly,
p227
aVwe hope to understand how to make them not fly.
p228
aVNow, one of the ways you can make them not fly
p229
aVis with DDT.
p230
aVThis is a real ad.
p231
aVThis is one of those things you just can't make up.
p232
aVOnce upon a time, this was the primary technique,
p233
aVand, in fact, many countries got rid of malaria through DDT.
p234
aVThe United States did.
p235
aVIn 1935, there were 150,000 cases a year
p236
aVof malaria in the United States,
p237
aVbut DDT and a massive public health effort
p238
aVmanaged to squelch it.
p239
aa(lp240
VSo we thought,
p241
aV"Well, we've done all these things that are focused on the Plasmodium,
p242
aVthe parasite involved.
p243
aVWhat can we do to the mosquito?
p244
aVWell, let's try to kill it with consumer electronics."
p245
aVNow, that sounds silly,
p246
aVbut each of these devices
p247
aVhas something interesting in it that maybe you could use.
p248
aVYour Blu-ray player has
p249
aVa very cheap blue laser.
p250
aVYour laser printer has a mirror galvanometer
p251
aVthat's used to steer a laser beam very accurately;
p252
aVthat's what makes those little dots on the page.
p253
aVAnd, of course, there's signal processing
p254
aVand digital cameras.
p255
aVSo what if we could put all that together
p256
aVto shoot them out of the sky with lasers?
p257
aa(lp258
V(Laughter)
p259
aa(lp260
V(Applause)
p261
aa(lp262
VNow, in our company, this is what we call
p263
aV"the pinky-suck moment."
p264
aa(lp265
V(Laughter)
p266
aa(lp267
VWhat if we could do that?
p268
aVNow, just suspend disbelief for a moment,
p269
aVand let's think of what could happen
p270
aVif we could do that.
p271
aVWell, we could protect very high-value targets like clinics.
p272
aVClinics are full of people that have malaria.
p273
aVThey're sick, and so they're less able to defend themselves from the mosquitoes.
p274
aVYou really want to protect them.
p275
aVOf course, if you do that,
p276
aVyou could also protect your backyard.
p277
aVAnd farmers could protect their crops
p278
aVthat they want to sell to Whole Foods
p279
aVbecause our photons
p280
aVare 100 percent organic. (Laughter)
p281
aVThey're completely natural.
p282
aa(lp283
VNow, it actually gets better than this.
p284
aVYou could, if you're really smart,
p285
aVyou could shine a nonlethal laser on the bug
p286
aVbefore you zap it,
p287
aVand you could listen to the wing beat frequency
p288
aVand you could measure the size.
p289
aVAnd then you could decide:
p290
aV"Is this an insect I want to kill,
p291
aVor an insect I don't want to kill?"
p292
aVMoore's law made computing cheap;
p293
aVso cheap we can weigh
p294
aVthe life of an individual insect
p295
aVand decide thumbs up
p296
aVor thumbs down. (Laughter)
p297
aVNow, it turns out we only kill the female mosquitoes.
p298
aVThey're the only ones that are dangerous.
p299
aVMosquitoes only drink blood
p300
aVto lay eggs.
p301
aVMosquitoes actually live ... their day-to-day nutrition
p302
aVcomes from nectar, from flowers \u2014
p303
aVin fact, in the lab, we feed ours raisins \u2014
p304
aVbut the female needs the blood meal.
p305
aVSo, this sounds really crazy, right?
p306
aVWould you like to see it?
p307
aa(lp308
VAudience: Yeah!
p309
aa(lp310
VNathan Myhrvold: Okay, so our legal department prepared a disclaimer,
p311
aVand here it is.
p312
aV(Laughter)
p313
aVNow, after thinking about this a little bit
p314
aVwe thought, you know, it probably would be simpler
p315
aVto do this with a nonlethal laser.
p316
aVSo, Eric Johanson, who built the device,
p317
aVactually, with parts from eBay;
p318
aVand Pablos Holman over here,
p319
aVhe's got mosquitoes in the tank.
p320
aVWe have the device over here.
p321
aVAnd we're going to show you,
p322
aVinstead of the kill laser,
p323
aVwhich will be a very brief, instantaneous pulse,
p324
aVwe're going to have a green laser pointer
p325
aVthat's going to stay on the mosquito for, actually, quite a long period of time;
p326
aVotherwise, you can't see it very well.
p327
aVTake it away Eric.
p328
aa(lp329
VEric Johanson: What we have here
p330
aVis a tank on the other side of the stage.
p331
aVAnd we have ... this computer screen
p332
aVcan actually see the mosquitoes as they fly around.
p333
aVAnd Pablos, if he stirs up our mosquitoes a little bit
p334
aVwe can see them flying around.
p335
aVNow, that's a fairly straightforward image processing routine,
p336
aVand let me show you how it works.
p337
aVHere you can see that the insects are being tracked
p338
aVas they're flying around,
p339
aVwhich is kind of fun.
p340
aVNext we can actually light them up with a laser. (Laughter)
p341
aVNow, this is a low powered laser,
p342
aVand we can actually pick up a wing-beat frequency.
p343
aVSo you may be able to hear some mosquitoes flying around.
p344
aa(lp345
VNM: That's a mosquito wing beat you're hearing.
p346
aa(lp347
VEJ: Finally, let's see what this looks like.
p348
aVThere you can see mosquitoes as they fly around, being lit up.
p349
aVThis is slowed way down
p350
aVso that you have an opportunity to see what's happening.
p351
aVHere we have it running at high-speed mode.
p352
aVSo this system that was built for TED is here to illustrate
p353
aVthat it is technically possible to actually deploy a system like this,
p354
aVand we're looking very hard at how to make it
p355
aVhighly cost-effective to use in places like Africa and other parts of the world.
p356
aa(lp357
V(Applause)
p358
aa(lp359
VNM: So it wouldn't be any fun to show you that
p360
aVwithout showing you what actually happens when we hit 'em.
p361
aV(Laughter)
p362
aV(Laughter)
p363
aVThis is very satisfying.
p364
aV(Laughter)
p365
aVThis is one of the first ones we did.
p366
aVThe energy's a little bit high here.
p367
aV(Laughter)
p368
aVWe'll loop around here in just a second, and you'll see another one.
p369
aVHere's another one. Bang.
p370
aVAn interesting thing is, we kill them all the time;
p371
aVwe've never actually gotten the wings to shut off in midair.
p372
aVThe wing motor is very resilient.
p373
aVI mean, here we're blowing wings off
p374
aVbut the wing motor keeps all the way down.
p375
aa(lp376
VSo, that's what I have. Thanks very much.
p377
aa(lp378
