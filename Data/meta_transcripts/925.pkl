VI am a marine toxicologist,
p4
aVand I've been very, very concerned about the Gulf,
p5
aVparticularly about the massive applications
p6
aVof the toxic dispersants,
p7
aVthe Corexits.
p8
aVI've been working on ocean pollution
p9
aVfor quite a long time \u2014
p10
aVthe impacts on marine life and particularly the impacts
p11
aVon marine mammals.
p12
aVAs it turns out, marine mammals
p13
aVare at the top of this food chain
p14
aVthat we're pouring millions of tons
p15
aVof toxic substances into
p16
aVevery year.
p17
aVAnd they are showing the signs of this.
p18
aVI'm sorry to have a sad slide like this,
p19
aVbut not everything is all that happy,
p20
aVespecially in my work.
p21
aVThey are loaded
p22
aVwith toxic chemicals in their body,
p23
aVhundreds of compounds,
p24
aVall kinds of compounds \u2014 it's staggering.
p25
aVAnd they're dying off rather regularly,
p26
aVtens of thousands around the world.
p27
aVIt's predicted they may go extinct \u2014
p28
aVabout a third of them \u2014
p29
aVwithin about 30 years.
p30
aa(lp31
VSo my project is along the Northwest Atlantic.
p32
aVIt's called Seals as Sentinels.
p33
aVWe're tracking pollution
p34
aVat the top of the food web, in marine mammals and fish.
p35
aVIt's a region-wide,
p36
aVeco-toxicological investigation.
p37
aVWe're looking at a lot of compounds,
p38
aVbut recently been quite interested in
p39
aVthe flame retardants, the brominated flame retardants
p40
aVthat are in many, many things
p41
aVthat we use in our everyday life,
p42
aVfrom the cushions in the chairs
p43
aVwe're all sitting on
p44
aVto the plastic casings of our computers,
p45
aVour television sets and so on.
p46
aVSo we are tracking
p47
aVhow do these things get from
p48
aVthe products into the ocean,
p49
aVwhich is the final sink for them.
p50
aVAnd there's quite a complicated pathway for that
p51
aVbecause, as these products age,
p52
aVthey get concentrated in dust,
p53
aVand then they also get thrown out, so they go to the landfills.
p54
aVThey wind up in waste water treatment plants.
p55
aVAs you all know, we throw out billions
p56
aVof computers and TVs every year.
p57
aVAnd those go to e-waste dumps.
p58
aVAnd all that gets into surface waters,
p59
aVeventually reaching the ocean, the final sink.
p60
aVSo, in our study,
p61
aVwe did find quite high levels, as we expected,
p62
aVof these flame retardants in the harbor seals' bodies.
p63
aVAnd we reported this.
p64
aVIt led to a ban of this neuro-toxic flame retardant
p65
aVcalled Deca in Maine, where I am based,
p66
aVand also then a phase-out,
p67
aVU.S.-wide, at the end of last year.
p68
aVBut we said, well, on the bright side,
p69
aVour harbor seals at least will not be
p70
aVbursting into flame anytime soon.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo then I got really curious,
p73
aVmyself, as a toxicologist,
p74
aVand I donated some blood to my lab
p75
aVand said, "Okay, let's do it."
p76
aVWell, we detected 113 different compounds
p77
aVin my blood.
p78
aVAnd I must say, if any of you would have this done,
p79
aVyou'd probably find a similar profile,
p80
aVor cocktail, as they call it.
p81
aVBut I was the recipient
p82
aVof a lot of flame retardant material for some reason.
p83
aVAnd just to point out the levels \u2014
p84
aVAmericans have 10 to 40 times higher
p85
aVlevels of these compounds in our bodies
p86
aVthan the Europeans.
p87
aVWhy? Because we are flame-retarding everything,
p88
aVand we have weak regulations
p89
aVfor toxic chemicals.
p90
aVBut lo and behold, I'm one of the high-end individuals.
p91
aVLucky me.
p92
aVBut then I thought,
p93
aVwell, in case of a fire, I might be the last one to ignite.
p94
aa(lp95
V(Laughter)
p96
aa(lp97
VSo anyway, here's the problem \u2014
p98
aVand it is a problem that we're looking at in the Gulf today \u2014
p99
aVwe're not regulating chemicals in this country properly.
p100
aVWe're hardly regulating them at all.
p101
aVAnd we're letting industry run the show.
p102
aVAnd Jackie Savitz spoke this morning
p103
aVabout Big Oil
p104
aVand the propaganda
p105
aVand how we're all brainwashed
p106
aVwith their, you know, lies and so forth.
p107
aVWell, Big Chemical
p108
aVis what we're dealing with here.
p109
aVAnd they're allowed to keep trade secrets,
p110
aVso they don't even give the ingredients out.
p111
aVPlus they don't give health and safety data,
p112
aVso, consequently, they cannot be regulated
p113
aVbefore they go to market.
p114
aVSo it's a case of innocent until proven guilty.
p115
aVThe burden of proof is not on the producer.
p116
aa(lp117
VSo I then was invited to go
p118
aVto the Gulf in May.
p119
aVI went down there on
p120
aVa preliminary investigation
p121
aVto look into dispersants
p122
aVand how they're going into the water column and so forth.
p123
aVAnd I was told that I was
p124
aVthe only toxicologist to date
p125
aVwho was dumb enough to get into the water,
p126
aVbut I did.
p127
aVAnd we dove in the slick
p128
aVwithout even HazMat gear.
p129
aVAnd I did get sick.
p130
aVI got a ferocious sore throat two days later.
p131
aVI felt like my throat was on fire.
p132
aVBut it did pass.
p133
aVAnd what I did see in the water as we went down,
p134
aVwhat really shocked me \u2014 and it's haunted me ever since \u2014
p135
aVbecause I could see the droplets of oil dispersing.
p136
aVAnd as you go down, they're catching all kinds of plankton,
p137
aVbumping into,
p138
aVyou know, little wisps of life
p139
aVthat are the food for the planktivores,
p140
aVthe herring kind of fish.
p141
aVAnd you could just see the web of death
p142
aVas you go down in the water column.
p143
aa(lp144
VWell, you know, we got into this
p145
aVin the beginning
p146
aVas a trade-off, they say,
p147
aVbetween the wetlands versus the ocean depth.
p148
aVAnd I didn't agree with that
p149
aVdecision at the time; I still don't.
p150
aVThe decision was to protect the marshes.
p151
aVWhen the oil gets into the marshes, you can't get it out.
p152
aVAnd as you know, there's been a very weak response,
p153
aVup until recently,
p154
aVto actually collect the oil.
p155
aVIt's gotten much more aggressive.
p156
aVThis is an Exxon slide showing what happens,
p157
aVthe scenario and the trade-off.
p158
aVSo this shows oil on the surface.
p159
aVYou can see it getting up into the mangrove,
p160
aVbut it is not harming the corals
p161
aVor the sea grass, right.
p162
aVSo here we have the other scenario.
p163
aVIf you disperse, the sea grass and the corals
p164
aVare getting hit pretty hard,
p165
aVbut you're saving the mangrove.
p166
aVSo this, to me, is like going to the eye doctor, okay?
p167
aVIs it better with one or two?
p168
aa(lp169
V(Laughter)
p170
aa(lp171
VThe problem is that we have
p172
aVreleased so darn much of this stuff,
p173
aVwe're climbing up to two million gallons
p174
aVvery quickly.
p175
aVAnd then there's the problem of the plumes.
p176
aVWhat plumes?
p177
aVIt turns out there are plumes.
p178
aVIndependent researchers found that.
p179
aVAnd then there's the looming,
p180
aVmessy problem of human health,
p181
aVreported human health effects.
p182
aVAnd actually, one of our federal officials
p183
aVsaid that it was probably heat stress. So ...
p184
aVHaving been in that water
p185
aVjust for the short time I was there,
p186
aVI can tell you, it is not heat stress.
p187
aVThere are volumes of volatile
p188
aVpetroleum fumes coming off that water,
p189
aVplus the Corexit,
p190
aVwhich has solvent in it.
p191
aVSo it is not at all rational.
p192
aa(lp193
VSo what do we have? The BP show is going on.
p194
aVOur officials complained about Corexit,
p195
aVwhich is the most toxic
p196
aVline of dispersants.
p197
aVBut heck, they're still using it,
p198
aVand they used the most toxic one, the 9527,
p199
aVuntil they ran out of supplies.
p200
aVNow they're on 9500.
p201
aV9527 had 2-butoxyethanol in it
p202
aVthat causes internal bleeding.
p203
aVWe know that from the Exxon Valdez spill, by the way.
p204
aVSo what we're doing, we're putting compounds
p205
aVwith petroleum solvents onto a petroleum spill.
p206
aVDoes this make sense?
p207
aVSo this is the way it works.
p208
aVAnd I want to show you this cute little thing that happens here.
p209
aVIt's a micelle.
p210
aVMicelles form around the oil.
p211
aVAnd what happens first
p212
aVis the solvents break into the oil,
p213
aVthe lipid membrane,
p214
aVthey let the surfactants in there.
p215
aVThe surfactants \u2014 which are like things
p216
aVwe use on fast food wrappers \u2014
p217
aVthey grab around the droplets of oil,
p218
aVand they make little, tiny droplets
p219
aVwith nice, little
p220
aVsurfactant edges to them.
p221
aVThe thing to remember about the micelles \u2014
p222
aVthese little floating
p223
aVglobules of toxin \u2014
p224
aVis they are there to deliver.
p225
aVThey're like the FedEx guys.
p226
aVAnd if you're a fish,
p227
aVand you haven't gotten your glob in the morning,
p228
aVyou're going to get it in the afternoon,
p229
aVbecause they've got your number.
p230
aa(lp231
VSo from a toxicology perspective,
p232
aVthis is really awful
p233
aVbecause Corexit and the dispersed oil
p234
aVare much more toxic together
p235
aVthan either alone.
p236
aVAnd usually the exposure
p237
aVis a combined exposure.
p238
aVThe dispersants \u2014 as I was saying \u2014
p239
aVtheir job is to break down
p240
aVthe lipid membrane.
p241
aVThe solvents in them do that very efficiently.
p242
aVSo they break down
p243
aVlipid membranes in our body,
p244
aVstarting with cells of the skin,
p245
aVthe cells of organs.
p246
aVSo it actually hastens
p247
aVoil getting into the body
p248
aVeasily and readily.
p249
aVOil contains hundreds of hydrocarbon compounds
p250
aVand other compounds
p251
aVthat are toxic to every organ in the body.
p252
aVAnd so with the dispersants combined,
p253
aVyou have this very synergistic
p254
aVcombined toxicity.
p255
aVCorexit also contains petroleum solvents
p256
aVand many other toxic compounds.
p257
aVAnd I'm part of a chat group,
p258
aVwhich is a national group
p259
aVof toxicologists and chemists
p260
aVthat are, you know, basically
p261
aVturning cartwheels trying to figure out what's in this stuff,
p262
aVand what is it doing and what are the interactions
p263
aVof these chemicals, most of which we don't know,
p264
aVand what are their byproducts,
p265
aVwhich are usually more toxic than the parent compound.
p266
aVSo we did find that Corexit 9500
p267
aVcontains heavy metals, arsenic and chromium \u2014
p268
aVarsenic at high enough levels
p269
aVto have cancer-causing effects.
p270
aa(lp271
VSo this is what we have to look at,
p272
aVthese, you know, ridiculous safety data sheets,
p273
aVwhich have nothing on them much.
p274
aVAnd now they were forced to release the ultimate list
p275
aVof everything that's in Corexit.
p276
aVAnd guess what,
p277
aVtons of stuff is missing.
p278
aVDerivatives, derivatives, these are whole big groups
p279
aVof many, many compounds, these sorbitans.
p280
aVAnd then you get down to the petroleum distillates,
p281
aVwhich are the solvents,
p282
aVhundreds of them.
p283
aVThey are not identified. And why?
p284
aVTrade secrets again.
p285
aVBP's running the show,
p286
aVand the Nalco company, this is all they have to do.
p287
aVSo far these ingredients have not been released,
p288
aVand toxicologists are actually going nuts
p289
aVbecause we cannot predict with certainty
p290
aVwhat the interactions
p291
aVand toxic results are going to be.
p292
aa(lp293
VBut we do have quite a lot at risk
p294
aVdown there, as we all know,
p295
aVthe 33 wildlife refuges,
p296
aVso much wildlife
p297
aVand fish and diversity.
p298
aVSo we know from previous spills.
p299
aVAnd then part of this is just
p300
aVpart of my bad dreams.
p301
aVAnd I appreciate being able
p302
aVto vent some of my
p303
aVanguish upon you.
p304
aVWhat we do know is that the corals are going to get hit hard.
p305
aVAnd this is a study that was done
p306
aVon the Australian coast,
p307
aVthe coast of Tasmania.
p308
aVCorals are, you know, the home to
p309
aVabout a quarter of all marine species.
p310
aVAnd with the Corexit
p311
aVand the oil,
p312
aVthere's zero percent fertilization.
p313
aVWith oil alone, there's 98 percent fertilization.
p314
aVSo they're a very sensitive species
p315
aVto this combo.
p316
aa(lp317
VHere's another group.
p318
aVI could see myself easily in the water column.
p319
aVThe plankton and the plankton eaters,
p320
aVyou know, these are the little herring fish
p321
aVthat go through the water column with their mouths open,
p322
aVfeeding indiscriminately
p323
aVand just lapping up
p324
aVthis brown pudding of toxic stuff.
p325
aVAnd we do know from other studies
p326
aVthat this is a highly toxic mixture.
p327
aVSee the oil and Corexit is causing death
p328
aVat a much, much lower dose
p329
aVthan oil alone.
p330
aVThat's probably as far as what we do know
p331
aVabout toxic effects.
p332
aVBut my bad dreams go like this.
p333
aVThe piscivorous fish,
p334
aVthe cobia, grouper, amberjacks, those big fish,
p335
aValso the tuna and sharks,
p336
aVare going to hit by this.
p337
aVAnd the gills are quite sensitive.
p338
aVThe respiratory system is very sensitive.
p339
aVThink about it with
p340
aVthe Corexit hitting the membranes,
p341
aVand it will clog up the gills,
p342
aVand then these animals are going to be
p343
aVgetting something like what you call
p344
aVchemical pneumonia,
p345
aVtrying to aspirate the compounds.
p346
aVIt also will cause internal bleeding
p347
aVupon ingestion.
p348
aVI'm very worried about the air-breathing mammals because I study them,
p349
aVbut also, the way their going to be exposed
p350
aVis every time they come to the surface to take a breath,
p351
aVthey're going to inhale these volatile fumes.
p352
aVAnd what does happen with that eventually
p353
aVis pneumonia sets in
p354
aVand liver, kidney, brain damage.
p355
aVThe Corexit
p356
aVis transporting the oil
p357
aVinto every membrane
p358
aVand every system of the body.
p359
aVAnd you're having
p360
aVa lot of different unpleasant effects,
p361
aVbut burns to the eyes and mouth,
p362
aVskin ulcers, lesions.
p363
aVAnd I think, personally,
p364
aVthat we have not begun to see
p365
aVthe impacts of this spill
p366
aVon the wildlife of the Gulf.
p367
aa(lp368
VWe started hypothesizing:
p369
aVwhat do we know?
p370
aVwhat do with think would be a trophic cascade?
p371
aVwhich means that somebody gets wiped out,
p372
aVand then everything above
p373
aVthat's eating those guys will crash.
p374
aVSo our thought was \u2014
p375
aVthis is a simple thinking process, but ...
p376
aVobviously the plankton, the planktivores,
p377
aVand that's about as far as we got.
p378
aVAnd then it turns out we're not very good at figuring this stuff out.
p379
aVThis is what the Exxon Valdez scientists thought would happen,
p380
aVthis trophic cascade
p381
aVwhere you lose the kelp and the herring
p382
aVand other fishes and going up.
p383
aVThey thought that eventually the killer whale
p384
aVwould be at the top of this cascade.
p385
aVAnd then here's what really happened,
p386
aVmuch more complicated, much more specific.
p387
aVActually the kelp
p388
aVand the barnacles that attach to the rock
p389
aVwere decimated by the combination
p390
aVof Corexit and the oil.
p391
aVThey were replaced by invasive species,
p392
aVwhich had less holding power to the rock.
p393
aVStorms came along.
p394
aVThey ripped out of the rock.
p395
aVAnd this was the entire food web for the sea ducks.
p396
aVAnd as you know, we lost about 300,000 sea ducks
p397
aVfrom the Exxon Valdez spill,
p398
aVand they haven't come back.
p399
aa(lp400
VSo we are launching
p401
aVan independent study.
p402
aVAnd by independent, I do not mean alone;
p403
aVI mean independent in the sense
p404
aVof not tied to
p405
aVthe kind of crime-scene secrecy
p406
aVthat's going on in the Gulf now.
p407
aVBut we are actually going to be assessing toxic impacts,
p408
aVbut we need lots and lots of partners
p409
aVto do this intelligently.
p410
aVWe have some of the partners lined up.
p411
aVAnd Dave Gallo signed on.
p412
aVSylvia's in here.
p413
aVAnd we hope that some of you will help us.
p414
aVMy question to you is: why shouldn't we know?
p415
aVDon't we have the right to know?
p416
aVSurely we have the right to learn
p417
aVwhat loss we are going through in the Gulf.
p418
aVAnd my wish would be \u2014
p419
aVfor the gulf prize \u2014 would be
p420
aVthat we have the truth.
p421
aVWhatever it is, please let us have the truth.
p422
aVAnd to get there,
p423
aVwe need to do the assessment.
p424
aa(lp425
VSo I appreciate being here. Thank you.
