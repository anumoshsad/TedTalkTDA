VI write about food. I write about cooking.
p4
aVI take it quite seriously,
p5
aVbut I'm here to talk about something
p6
aVthat's become very important to me in the last year or two.
p7
aVIt is about food, but it's not about cooking, per se.
p8
aVI'm going to start with this picture of a beautiful cow.
p9
aVI'm not a vegetarian \u2014 this is the old Nixon line, right?
p10
aVBut I still think that this \u2014
p11
aV(Laughter)
p12
aV\u2014 may be this year's version of this.
p13
aa(lp14
VNow, that is only a little bit hyperbolic.
p15
aVAnd why do I say it?
p16
aVBecause only once before has the fate of individual people
p17
aVand the fate of all of humanity
p18
aVbeen so intertwined.
p19
aVThere was the bomb, and there's now.
p20
aVAnd where we go from here is going to determine
p21
aVnot only the quality and the length of our individual lives,
p22
aVbut whether, if we could see the Earth a century from now,
p23
aVwe'd recognize it.
p24
aVIt's a holocaust of a different kind,
p25
aVand hiding under our desks isn't going to help.
p26
aVStart with the notion that global warming
p27
aVis not only real, but dangerous.
p28
aVSince every scientist in the world now believes this,
p29
aVand even President Bush has seen the light, or pretends to,
p30
aVwe can take this is a given.
p31
aa(lp32
VThen hear this, please.
p33
aVAfter energy production, livestock is the second-highest contributor
p34
aVto atmosphere-altering gases.
p35
aVNearly one-fifth of all greenhouse gas
p36
aVis generated by livestock production \u2014
p37
aVmore than transportation.
p38
aVNow, you can make all the jokes you want about cow farts,
p39
aVbut methane is 20 times more poisonous than CO2,
p40
aVand it's not just methane.
p41
aVLivestock is also one of the biggest culprits in land degradation,
p42
aVair and water pollution, water shortages and loss of biodiversity.
p43
aVThere's more.
p44
aVLike half the antibiotics in this country
p45
aVare not administered to people, but to animals.
p46
aVBut lists like this become kind of numbing, so let me just say this:
p47
aVif you're a progressive,
p48
aVif you're driving a Prius, or you're shopping green,
p49
aVor you're looking for organic,
p50
aVyou should probably be a semi-vegetarian.
p51
aVNow, I'm no more anti-cattle than I am anti-atom,
p52
aVbut it's all in the way we use these things.
p53
aVThere's another piece of the puzzle,
p54
aVwhich Ann Cooper talked about beautifully yesterday,
p55
aVand one you already know.
p56
aa(lp57
VThere's no question, none, that so-called lifestyle diseases \u2014
p58
aVdiabetes, heart disease, stroke, some cancers \u2014
p59
aVare diseases that are far more prevalent here
p60
aVthan anywhere in the rest of the world.
p61
aVAnd that's the direct result of eating a Western diet.
p62
aVOur demand for meat, dairy and refined carbohydrates \u2014
p63
aVthe world consumes one billion cans or bottles of Coke a day \u2014
p64
aVour demand for these things, not our need, our want,
p65
aVdrives us to consume way more calories than are good for us.
p66
aVAnd those calories are in foods that cause, not prevent, disease.
p67
aVNow global warming was unforeseen.
p68
aVWe didn't know that pollution did more than cause bad visibility.
p69
aVMaybe a few lung diseases here and there,
p70
aVbut, you know, that's not such a big deal.
p71
aVThe current health crisis, however,
p72
aVis a little more the work of the evil empire.
p73
aVWe were told, we were assured,
p74
aVthat the more meat and dairy and poultry we ate,
p75
aVthe healthier we'd be.
p76
aa(lp77
VNo. Overconsumption of animals, and of course, junk food,
p78
aVis the problem, along with our paltry consumption of plants.
p79
aVNow, there's no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here,
p80
aVbut the evidence is that plants \u2014 and I want to make this clear \u2014
p81
aVit's not the ingredients in plants, it's the plants.
p82
aVIt's not the beta-carotene, it's the carrot.
p83
aVThe evidence is very clear that plants promote health.
p84
aVThis evidence is overwhelming at this point.
p85
aVYou eat more plants, you eat less other stuff, you live longer.
p86
aVNot bad.
p87
aVBut back to animals and junk food.
p88
aVWhat do they have in common?
p89
aVOne: we don't need either of them for health.
p90
aVWe don't need animal products,
p91
aVand we certainly don't need white bread or Coke.
p92
aVTwo: both have been marketed heavily,
p93
aVcreating unnatural demand.
p94
aVWe're not born craving Whoppers or Skittles.
p95
aVThree: their production has been supported by government agencies
p96
aVat the expense of a more health- and Earth-friendly diet.
p97
aa(lp98
VNow, let's imagine a parallel.
p99
aVLet's pretend that our government supported an oil-based economy,
p100
aVwhile discouraging more sustainable forms of energy,
p101
aVknowing all the while that the result would be
p102
aVpollution, war and rising costs.
p103
aVIncredible, isn't it?
p104
aVYet they do that.
p105
aVAnd they do this here. It's the same deal.
p106
aVThe sad thing is, when it comes to diet,
p107
aVis that even when well-intentioned Feds
p108
aVtry to do right by us, they fail.
p109
aVEither they're outvoted by puppets of agribusiness,
p110
aVor they are puppets of agribusiness.
p111
aVSo, when the USDA finally acknowledged
p112
aVthat it was plants, rather than animals, that made people healthy,
p113
aVthey encouraged us, via their overly simplistic food pyramid,
p114
aVto eat five servings of fruits and vegetables a day,
p115
aValong with more carbs.
p116
aVWhat they didn't tell us is that some carbs are better than others,
p117
aVand that plants and whole grains
p118
aVshould be supplanting eating junk food.
p119
aVBut industry lobbyists would never let that happen.
p120
aVAnd guess what?
p121
aVHalf the people who developed the food pyramid
p122
aVhave ties to agribusiness.
p123
aVSo, instead of substituting plants for animals,
p124
aVour swollen appetites simply became larger,
p125
aVand the most dangerous aspects of them remained unchanged.
p126
aVSo-called low-fat diets, so-called low-carb diets \u2014
p127
aVthese are not solutions.
p128
aa(lp129
VBut with lots of intelligent people
p130
aVfocusing on whether food is organic or local,
p131
aVor whether we're being nice to animals,
p132
aVthe most important issues just aren't being addressed.
p133
aVNow, don't get me wrong.
p134
aVI like animals,
p135
aVand I don't think it's just fine to industrialize their production
p136
aVand to churn them out like they were wrenches.
p137
aVBut there's no way to treat animals well,
p138
aVwhen you're killing 10 billion of them a year.
p139
aVThat's our number. 10 billion.
p140
aVIf you strung all of them \u2014
p141
aVchickens, cows, pigs and lambs \u2014 to the moon,
p142
aVthey'd go there and back five times, there and back.
p143
aVNow, my math's a little shaky, but this is pretty good,
p144
aVand it depends whether a pig is four feet long or five feet long,
p145
aVbut you get the idea.
p146
aVThat's just the United States.
p147
aVAnd with our hyper-consumption of those animals
p148
aVproducing greenhouse gases and heart disease,
p149
aVkindness might just be a bit of a red herring.
p150
aVLet's get the numbers of the animals we're killing for eating down,
p151
aVand then we'll worry about being nice to the ones that are left.
p152
aa(lp153
VAnother red herring might be exemplified by the word "locavore,"
p154
aVwhich was just named word of the year by the New Oxford American Dictionary.
p155
aVSeriously.
p156
aVAnd locavore, for those of you who don't know,
p157
aVis someone who eats only locally grown food \u2014
p158
aVwhich is fine if you live in California,
p159
aVbut for the rest of us it's a bit of a sad joke.
p160
aVBetween the official story \u2014 the food pyramid \u2014
p161
aVand the hip locavore vision,
p162
aVyou have two versions of how to improve our eating.
p163
aV(Laughter).
p164
aa(lp165
VThey both get it wrong, though.
p166
aVThe first at least is populist, and the second is elitist.
p167
aVHow we got to this place is the history of food in the United States.
p168
aVAnd I'm going to go through that,
p169
aVat least the last hundred years or so, very quickly right now.
p170
aVA hundred years ago, guess what?
p171
aVEveryone was a locavore: even New York had pig farms nearby,
p172
aVand shipping food all over the place was a ridiculous notion.
p173
aVEvery family had a cook, usually a mom.
p174
aVAnd those moms bought and prepared food.
p175
aVIt was like your romantic vision of Europe.
p176
aVMargarine didn't exist.
p177
aVIn fact, when margarine was invented,
p178
aVseveral states passed laws declaring that it had to be dyed pink,
p179
aVso we'd all know that it was a fake.
p180
aVThere was no snack food, and until the '20s,
p181
aVuntil Clarence Birdseye came along, there was no frozen food.
p182
aVThere were no restaurant chains.
p183
aVThere were neighborhood restaurants run by local people,
p184
aVbut none of them would think to open another one.
p185
aVEating ethnic was unheard of unless you were ethnic.
p186
aVAnd fancy food was entirely French.
p187
aVAs an aside, those of you who remember
p188
aVDan Aykroyd in the 1970s doing Julia Child imitations
p189
aVcan see where he got the idea of stabbing himself from this fabulous slide.
p190
aV(Laughter)
p191
aa(lp192
VBack in those days, before even Julia,
p193
aVback in those days, there was no philosophy of food.
p194
aVYou just ate.
p195
aVYou didn't claim to be anything.
p196
aVThere was no marketing. There were no national brands.
p197
aVVitamins had not been invented.
p198
aVThere were no health claims, at least not federally sanctioned ones.
p199
aVFats, carbs, proteins \u2014 they weren't bad or good, they were food.
p200
aVYou ate food.
p201
aVHardly anything contained more than one ingredient,
p202
aVbecause it was an ingredient.
p203
aVThe cornflake hadn't been invented.
p204
aV(Laughter)
p205
aVThe Pop-Tart, the Pringle, Cheez Whiz, none of that stuff.
p206
aVGoldfish swam.
p207
aV(Laughter)
p208
aVIt's hard to imagine. People grew food, and they ate food.
p209
aVAnd again, everyone ate local.
p210
aVIn New York, an orange was a common Christmas present,
p211
aVbecause it came all the way from Florida.
p212
aVFrom the '30s on, road systems expanded,
p213
aVtrucks took the place of railroads,
p214
aVfresh food began to travel more.
p215
aVOranges became common in New York.
p216
aVThe South and West became agricultural hubs,
p217
aVand in other parts of the country, suburbs took over farmland.
p218
aVThe effects of this are well known. They are everywhere.
p219
aVAnd the death of family farms is part of this puzzle,
p220
aVas is almost everything
p221
aVfrom the demise of the real community
p222
aVto the challenge of finding a good tomato, even in summer.
p223
aVEventually, California produced too much food to ship fresh,
p224
aVso it became critical to market canned and frozen foods.
p225
aVThus arrived convenience.
p226
aVIt was sold to proto-feminist housewives
p227
aVas a way to cut down on housework.
p228
aa(lp229
VNow, I know everybody over the age of, like 45 \u2014
p230
aVtheir mouths are watering at this point.
p231
aV(Laughter)
p232
aV(Applause)
p233
aVIf we had a slide of Salisbury steak, even more so, right?
p234
aV(Laughter)
p235
aVBut this may have cut down on housework,
p236
aVbut it cut down on the variety of food we ate as well.
p237
aVMany of us grew up never eating a fresh vegetable
p238
aVexcept the occasional raw carrot or maybe an odd lettuce salad.
p239
aVI, for one \u2014 and I'm not kidding \u2014
p240
aVdidn't eat real spinach or broccoli till I was 19.
p241
aVWho needed it though? Meat was everywhere.
p242
aVWhat could be easier, more filling or healthier for your family
p243
aVthan broiling a steak?
p244
aVBut by then cattle were already raised unnaturally.
p245
aVRather than spending their lives eating grass,
p246
aVfor which their stomachs were designed,
p247
aVthey were forced to eat soy and corn.
p248
aVThey have trouble digesting those grains, of course,
p249
aVbut that wasn't a problem for producers.
p250
aVNew drugs kept them healthy.
p251
aVWell, they kept them alive.
p252
aVHealthy was another story.
p253
aa(lp254
VThanks to farm subsidies,
p255
aVthe fine collaboration between agribusiness and Congress,
p256
aVsoy, corn and cattle became king.
p257
aVAnd chicken soon joined them on the throne.
p258
aVIt was during this period that the cycle of
p259
aVdietary and planetary destruction began,
p260
aVthe thing we're only realizing just now.
p261
aVListen to this,
p262
aVbetween 1950 and 2000, the world's population doubled.
p263
aVMeat consumption increased five-fold.
p264
aVNow, someone had to eat all that stuff, so we got fast food.
p265
aVAnd this took care of the situation resoundingly.
p266
aVHome cooking remained the norm, but its quality was down the tubes.
p267
aVThere were fewer meals with home-cooked breads, desserts and soups,
p268
aVbecause all of them could be bought at any store.
p269
aVNot that they were any good, but they were there.
p270
aVMost moms cooked like mine:
p271
aVa piece of broiled meat, a quickly made salad with bottled dressing,
p272
aVcanned soup, canned fruit salad.
p273
aVMaybe baked or mashed potatoes,
p274
aVor perhaps the stupidest food ever, Minute Rice.
p275
aVFor dessert, store-bought ice cream or cookies.
p276
aVMy mom is not here, so I can say this now.
p277
aVThis kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself.
p278
aV(Laughter)
p279
aa(lp280
VIt wasn't all bad.
p281
aVBy the '70s, forward-thinking people
p282
aVbegan to recognize the value of local ingredients.
p283
aVWe tended gardens, we became interested in organic food,
p284
aVwe knew or we were vegetarians.
p285
aVWe weren't all hippies, either.
p286
aVSome of us were eating in good restaurants and learning how to cook well.
p287
aVMeanwhile, food production had become industrial. Industrial.
p288
aVPerhaps because it was being produced rationally,
p289
aVas if it were plastic,
p290
aVfood gained magical or poisonous powers, or both.
p291
aVMany people became fat-phobic.
p292
aVOthers worshiped broccoli, as if it were God-like.
p293
aVBut mostly they didn't eat broccoli.
p294
aVInstead they were sold on yogurt,
p295
aVyogurt being almost as good as broccoli.
p296
aVExcept, in reality, the way the industry sold yogurt
p297
aVwas to convert it to something much more akin to ice cream.
p298
aVSimilarly, let's look at a granola bar.
p299
aVYou think that that might be healthy food,
p300
aVbut in fact, if you look at the ingredient list,
p301
aVit's closer in form to a Snickers than it is to oatmeal.
p302
aVSadly, it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma,
p303
aVif not actually killed \u2014
p304
aVthe beginning of the heyday of value-added food,
p305
aVwhich contained as many soy and corn products
p306
aVas could be crammed into it.
p307
aa(lp308
VThink of the frozen chicken nugget.
p309
aVThe chicken is fed corn, and then its meat is ground up,
p310
aVand mixed with more corn products to add bulk and binder,
p311
aVand then it's fried in corn oil.
p312
aVAll you do is nuke it. What could be better?
p313
aVAnd zapped horribly, pathetically.
p314
aVBy the '70s, home cooking was in such a sad state
p315
aVthat the high fat and spice contents of foods
p316
aVlike McNuggets and Hot Pockets \u2014
p317
aVand we all have our favorites, actually \u2014
p318
aVmade this stuff more appealing than the bland things
p319
aVthat people were serving at home.
p320
aVAt the same time, masses of women were entering the workforce,
p321
aVand cooking simply wasn't important enough
p322
aVfor men to share the burden.
p323
aVSo now, you've got your pizza nights, you've got your microwave nights,
p324
aVyou've got your grazing nights,
p325
aVyou've got your fend-for-yourself nights and so on.
p326
aa(lp327
VLeading the way \u2014 what's leading the way?
p328
aVMeat, junk food, cheese:
p329
aVthe very stuff that will kill you.
p330
aVSo, now we clamor for organic food.
p331
aVThat's good.
p332
aVAnd as evidence that things can actually change,
p333
aVyou can now find organic food in supermarkets,
p334
aVand even in fast-food outlets.
p335
aVBut organic food isn't the answer either,
p336
aVat least not the way it's currently defined.
p337
aVLet me pose you a question.
p338
aVCan farm-raised salmon be organic,
p339
aVwhen its feed has nothing to do with its natural diet,
p340
aVeven if the feed itself is supposedly organic, and the fish themselves
p341
aVare packed tightly in pens, swimming in their own filth?
p342
aVAnd if that salmon's from Chile, and it's killed down there
p343
aVand then flown 5,000 miles, whatever,
p344
aVdumping how much carbon into the atmosphere?
p345
aVI don't know.
p346
aVPacked in Styrofoam, of course,
p347
aVbefore landing somewhere in the United States,
p348
aVand then being trucked a few hundred more miles.
p349
aVThis may be organic in letter, but it's surely not organic in spirit.
p350
aVNow here is where we all meet.
p351
aVThe locavores, the organivores, the vegetarians,
p352
aVthe vegans, the gourmets
p353
aVand those of us who are just plain interested in good food.
p354
aVEven though we've come to this from different points,
p355
aVwe all have to act on our knowledge
p356
aVto change the way that everyone thinks about food.
p357
aa(lp358
VWe need to start acting.
p359
aVAnd this is not only an issue of social justice, as Ann Cooper said \u2014
p360
aVand, of course, she's completely right \u2014
p361
aVbut it's also one of global survival.
p362
aVWhich bring me full circle and points directly to the core issue,
p363
aVthe overproduction and overconsumption of meat and junk food.
p364
aVAs I said, 18 percent of greenhouse gases
p365
aVare attributed to livestock production.
p366
aVHow much livestock do you need to produce this?
p367
aV70 percent of the agricultural land on Earth,
p368
aV30 percent of the Earth's land surface is directly or indirectly devoted
p369
aVto raising the animals we'll eat.
p370
aVAnd this amount is predicted to double in the next 40 years or so.
p371
aa(lp372
VAnd if the numbers coming in from China
p373
aVare anything like what they look like now,
p374
aVit's not going to be 40 years.
p375
aVThere is no good reason for eating as much meat as we do.
p376
aVAnd I say this as a man who has eaten a fair share of corned beef in his life.
p377
aVThe most common argument is that we need nutrients \u2014
p378
aVeven though we eat, on average, twice as much protein
p379
aVas even the industry-obsessed USDA recommends.
p380
aVBut listen: experts who are serious about disease reduction
p381
aVrecommend that adults eat just over half a pound of meat per week.
p382
aa(lp383
VWhat do you think we eat per day? Half a pound.
p384
aVBut don't we need meat to be big and strong?
p385
aVIsn't meat eating essential to health?
p386
aVWon't a diet heavy in fruit and vegetables
p387
aVturn us into godless, sissy, liberals?
p388
aV(Laughter)
p389
aVSome of us might think that would be a good thing.
p390
aVBut, no, even if we were all steroid-filled football players,
p391
aVthe answer is no.
p392
aVIn fact, there's no diet on Earth that meets
p393
aVbasic nutritional needs that won't promote growth,
p394
aVand many will make you much healthier than ours does.
p395
aVWe don't eat animal products for sufficient nutrition,
p396
aVwe eat them to have an odd form of malnutrition, and it's killing us.
p397
aVTo suggest that in the interests of personal and human health
p398
aVAmericans eat 50 percent less meat \u2014
p399
aVit's not enough of a cut, but it's a start.
p400
aa(lp401
VIt would seem absurd, but that's exactly what should happen,
p402
aVand what progressive people, forward-thinking people
p403
aVshould be doing and advocating,
p404
aValong with the corresponding increase in the consumption of plants.
p405
aVI've been writing about food more or less omnivorously \u2014
p406
aVone might say indiscriminately \u2014 for about 30 years.
p407
aVDuring that time, I've eaten
p408
aVand recommended eating just about everything.
p409
aVI'll never stop eating animals, I'm sure,
p410
aVbut I do think that for the benefit of everyone,
p411
aVthe time has come to stop raising them industrially
p412
aVand stop eating them thoughtlessly.
p413
aa(lp414
VAnn Cooper's right.
p415
aVThe USDA is not our ally here.
p416
aVWe have to take matters into our own hands,
p417
aVnot only by advocating for a better diet for everyone \u2014
p418
aVand that's the hard part \u2014 but by improving our own.
p419
aVAnd that happens to be quite easy.
p420
