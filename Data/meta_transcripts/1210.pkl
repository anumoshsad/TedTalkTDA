VPlanetary systems outside our own
p4
aVare like distant cities whose lights we can see twinkling,
p5
aVbut whose streets we can't walk.
p6
aVBy studying those twinkling lights though,
p7
aVwe can learn about how stars and planets interact
p8
aVto form their own ecosystem
p9
aVand make habitats that are amenable to life.
p10
aa(lp11
VIn this image of the Tokyo skyline,
p12
aVI've hidden data
p13
aVfrom the newest planet-hunting space telescope on the block,
p14
aVthe Kepler Mission.
p15
aVCan you see it?
p16
aVThere we go.
p17
aVThis is just a tiny part of the sky the Kepler stares at,
p18
aVwhere it searches for planets
p19
aVby measuring the light from over 150,000 stars,
p20
aVall at once, every half hour,
p21
aVand very precisely.
p22
aa(lp23
VAnd what we're looking for
p24
aVis the tiny dimming of light
p25
aVthat is caused by a planet passing in front of one of these stars
p26
aVand blocking some of that starlight from getting to us.
p27
aVIn just over two years of operations,
p28
aVwe've found over 1,200
p29
aVpotential new planetary systems around other stars.
p30
aVTo give you some perspective,
p31
aVin the previous two decades of searching,
p32
aVwe had only known about 400
p33
aVprior to Kepler.
p34
aa(lp35
VWhen we see these little dips in the light,
p36
aVwe can determine a number of things.
p37
aVFor one thing, we can determine that there's a planet there,
p38
aVbut also how big that planet is
p39
aVand how far it is away from its parent star.
p40
aVThat distance is really important
p41
aVbecause it tells us
p42
aVhow much light the planet receives overall.
p43
aVAnd that distance and knowing that amount of light is important
p44
aVbecause it's a little like you or I sitting around a campfire:
p45
aVYou want to be close enough to the campfire so that you're warm,
p46
aVbut not so close
p47
aVthat you're too toasty and you get burned.
p48
aa(lp49
VHowever, there's more to know about your parent star
p50
aVthan just how much light you receive overall.
p51
aVAnd I'll tell you why.
p52
aVThis is our star. This is our Sun.
p53
aVIt's shown here in visible light.
p54
aVThat's the light that you can see with your own human eyes.
p55
aVYou'll notice that it looks pretty much
p56
aVlike the iconic yellow ball \u2014
p57
aVthat Sun that we all draw when we're children.
p58
aVBut you'll notice something else,
p59
aVand that's that the face of the Sun
p60
aVhas freckles.
p61
aVThese freckles are called sunspots,
p62
aVand they are just one of the manifestations
p63
aVof the Sun's magnetic field.
p64
aVThey also cause the light from the star to vary.
p65
aVAnd we can measure this
p66
aVvery, very precisely with Kepler and trace their effects.
p67
aa(lp68
VHowever, these are just the tip of the iceberg.
p69
aVIf we had UV eyes or X-ray eyes,
p70
aVwe would really see
p71
aVthe dynamic and dramatic effects
p72
aVof our Sun's magnetic activity \u2014
p73
aVthe kind of thing that happens on other stars as well.
p74
aVJust think, even when it's cloudy outside,
p75
aVthese kind of events are happening
p76
aVin the sky above you all the time.
p77
aVSo when we want to learn whether a planet is habitable,
p78
aVwhether it might be amenable to life,
p79
aVwe want to know not only how much total light it receives
p80
aVand how warm it is,
p81
aVbut we want to know about its space weather \u2014
p82
aVthis high-energy radiation,
p83
aVthe UV and the X-rays
p84
aVthat are created by its star
p85
aVand that bathe it in this bath of high-energy radiation.
p86
aa(lp87
VAnd so, we can't really look
p88
aVat planets around other stars
p89
aVin the same kind of detail
p90
aVthat we can look at planets in our own solar system.
p91
aVI'm showing here Venus, Earth and Mars \u2014
p92
aVthree planets in our own solar system that are roughly the same size,
p93
aVbut only one of which
p94
aVis really a good place to live.
p95
aVBut what we can do in the meantime
p96
aVis measure the light from our stars
p97
aVand learn about this relationship
p98
aVbetween the planets and their parent stars
p99
aVto suss out clues
p100
aVabout which planets might be good places
p101
aVto look for life in the universe.
p102
aa(lp103
VKepler won't find a planet
p104
aVaround every single star it looks at.
p105
aVBut really, every measurement it makes
p106
aVis precious,
p107
aVbecause it's teaching us about the relationship
p108
aVbetween stars and planets,
p109
aVand how it's really the starlight
p110
aVthat sets the stage
p111
aVfor the formation of life in the universe.
p112
aVWhile it's Kepler the telescope, the instrument that stares,
p113
aVit's we, life, who are searching.
