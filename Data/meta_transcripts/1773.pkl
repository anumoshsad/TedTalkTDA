VIn the northwest corner of the United States,
p4
aVright up near the Canadian border,
p5
aVthere's a little town called Libby, Montana,
p6
aVand it's surrounded by pine trees and lakes
p7
aVand just amazing wildlife
p8
aVand these enormous trees that scream up into the sky.
p9
aVAnd in there is a little town called Libby,
p10
aVwhich I visited, which feels kind of lonely,
p11
aVa little isolated.
p12
aVAnd in Libby, Montana, there's a rather unusual woman
p13
aVnamed Gayla Benefield.
p14
aVShe always felt a little bit of an outsider,
p15
aValthough she's been there almost all her life,
p16
aVa woman of Russian extraction.
p17
aVShe told me when she went to school,
p18
aVshe was the only girl who ever chose
p19
aVto do mechanical drawing.
p20
aVLater in life, she got a job going house to house
p21
aVreading utility meters \u2014 gas meters, electricity meters.
p22
aVAnd she was doing the work in the middle of the day,
p23
aVand one thing particularly caught her notice, which was,
p24
aVin the middle of the day she met a lot of men
p25
aVwho were at home, middle aged, late middle aged,
p26
aVand a lot of them seemed to be on oxygen tanks.
p27
aVIt struck her as strange.
p28
aVThen, a few years later, her father died at the age of 59,
p29
aVfive days before he was due to receive his pension.
p30
aVHe'd been a miner.
p31
aVShe thought he must just have been worn out by the work.
p32
aVBut then a few years later, her mother died,
p33
aVand that seemed stranger still,
p34
aVbecause her mother came from a long line of people
p35
aVwho just seemed to live forever.
p36
aVIn fact, Gayla's uncle is still alive to this day,
p37
aVand learning how to waltz.
p38
aVIt didn't make sense that Gayla's mother
p39
aVshould die so young.
p40
aVIt was an anomaly, and she kept puzzling over anomalies.
p41
aVAnd as she did, other ones came to mind.
p42
aVShe remembered, for example,
p43
aVwhen her mother had broken a leg and went into the hospital,
p44
aVand she had a lot of x-rays,
p45
aVand two of them were leg x-rays, which made sense,
p46
aVbut six of them were chest x-rays, which didn't.
p47
aVShe puzzled and puzzled over every piece
p48
aVof her life and her parents' life,
p49
aVtrying to understand what she was seeing.
p50
aVShe thought about her town.
p51
aVThe town had a vermiculite mine in it.
p52
aVVermiculite was used for soil conditioners,
p53
aVto make plants grow faster and better.
p54
aVVermiculite was used to insulate lofts,
p55
aVhuge amounts of it put under the roof
p56
aVto keep houses warm during the long Montana winters.
p57
aVVermiculite was in the playground.
p58
aVIt was in the football ground.
p59
aVIt was in the skating rink.
p60
aVWhat she didn't learn until she started working this problem
p61
aVis vermiculite is a very toxic form of asbestos.
p62
aVWhen she figured out the puzzle,
p63
aVshe started telling everyone she could
p64
aVwhat had happened, what had been done to her parents
p65
aVand to the people that she saw on oxygen tanks
p66
aVat home in the afternoons.
p67
aVBut she was really amazed.
p68
aVShe thought, when everybody knows, they'll want to do something,
p69
aVbut actually nobody wanted to know.
p70
aVIn fact, she became so annoying
p71
aVas she kept insisting on telling this story
p72
aVto her neighbors, to her friends, to other people in the community,
p73
aVthat eventually a bunch of them got together
p74
aVand they made a bumper sticker,
p75
aVwhich they proudly displayed on their cars, which said,
p76
aV"Yes, I'm from Libby, Montana,
p77
aVand no, I don't have asbestosis."
p78
aVBut Gayla didn't stop. She kept doing research.
p79
aVThe advent of the Internet definitely helped her.
p80
aVShe talked to anybody she could.
p81
aVShe argued and argued, and finally she struck lucky
p82
aVwhen a researcher came through town
p83
aVstudying the history of mines in the area,
p84
aVand she told him her story, and at first, of course,
p85
aVlike everyone, he didn't believe her,
p86
aVbut he went back to Seattle and he did his own research
p87
aVand he realized that she was right.
p88
aVSo now she had an ally.
p89
aVNevertheless, people still didn't want to know.
p90
aVThey said things like, "Well, if it were really dangerous,
p91
aVsomeone would have told us."
p92
aV"If that's really why everyone was dying,
p93
aVthe doctors would have told us."
p94
aVSome of the guys used to very heavy jobs said,
p95
aV"I don't want to be a victim.
p96
aVI can't possibly be a victim, and anyway,
p97
aVevery industry has its accidents."
p98
aVBut still Gayla went on, and finally she succeeded
p99
aVin getting a federal agency to come to town
p100
aVand to screen the inhabitants of the town \u2014
p101
aV15,000 people \u2014 and what they discovered
p102
aVwas that the town had a mortality rate
p103
aV80 times higher than anywhere in the United States.
p104
aVThat was in 2002, and even at that moment,
p105
aVno one raised their hand to say, "Gayla,
p106
aVlook in the playground where your grandchildren are playing.
p107
aVIt's lined with vermiculite."
p108
aVThis wasn't ignorance.
p109
aVIt was willful blindness.
p110
aVWillful blindness is a legal concept which means,
p111
aVif there's information that you could know and you should know
p112
aVbut you somehow manage not to know,
p113
aVthe law deems that you're willfully blind.
p114
aVYou have chosen not to know.
p115
aVThere's a lot of willful blindness around these days.
p116
aVYou can see willful blindness in banks,
p117
aVwhen thousands of people sold mortgages to people
p118
aVwho couldn't afford them.
p119
aVYou could see them in banks
p120
aVwhen interest rates were manipulated
p121
aVand everyone around knew what was going on,
p122
aVbut everyone studiously ignored it.
p123
aVYou can see willful blindness in the Catholic Church,
p124
aVwhere decades of child abuse went ignored.
p125
aVYou could see willful blindness
p126
aVin the run-up to the Iraq War.
p127
aVWillful blindness exists on epic scales like those,
p128
aVand it also exists on very small scales,
p129
aVin people's families, in people's homes and communities,
p130
aVand particularly in organizations and institutions.
p131
aVCompanies that have been studied for willful blindness
p132
aVcan be asked questions like,
p133
aV"Are there issues at work
p134
aVthat people are afraid to raise?"
p135
aVAnd when academics have done studies like this
p136
aVof corporations in the United States,
p137
aVwhat they find is 85 percent of people say yes.
p138
aVEighty-five percent of people know there's a problem,
p139
aVbut they won't say anything.
p140
aVAnd when I duplicated the research in Europe,
p141
aVasking all the same questions,
p142
aVI found exactly the same number.
p143
aVEighty-five percent. That's a lot of silence.
p144
aVIt's a lot of blindness.
p145
aVAnd what's really interesting is that when I go to companies in Switzerland,
p146
aVthey tell me, "This is a uniquely Swiss problem."
p147
aVAnd when I go to Germany, they say, "Oh yes, this is the German disease."
p148
aVAnd when I go to companies in England, they say,
p149
aV"Oh, yeah, the British are really bad at this."
p150
aVAnd the truth is, this is a human problem.
p151
aVWe're all, under certain circumstances, willfully blind.
p152
aVWhat the research shows is that some people are blind
p153
aVout of fear. They're afraid of retaliation.
p154
aVAnd some people are blind because they think, well,
p155
aVseeing anything is just futile.
p156
aVNothing's ever going to change.
p157
aVIf we make a protest, if we protest against the Iraq War,
p158
aVnothing changes, so why bother?
p159
aVBetter not to see this stuff at all.
p160
aVAnd the recurrent theme that I encounter all the time
p161
aVis people say, "Well, you know,
p162
aVthe people who do see, they're whistleblowers,
p163
aVand we all know what happens to them."
p164
aVSo there's this profound mythology around whistleblowers
p165
aVwhich says, first of all, they're all crazy.
p166
aVBut what I've found going around the world
p167
aVand talking to whistleblowers is, actually,
p168
aVthey're very loyal and quite often very conservative people.
p169
aVThey're hugely dedicated to the institutions that they work for,
p170
aVand the reason that they speak up,
p171
aVthe reason they insist on seeing,
p172
aVis because they care so much about the institution
p173
aVand want to keep it healthy.
p174
aVAnd the other thing that people often say
p175
aVabout whistleblowers is, "Well, there's no point,
p176
aVbecause you see what happens to them.
p177
aVThey are crushed.
p178
aVNobody would want to go through something like that."
p179
aVAnd yet, when I talk to whistleblowers,
p180
aVthe recurrent tone that I hear is pride.
p181
aVI think of Joe Darby.
p182
aVWe all remember the photographs of Abu Ghraib,
p183
aVwhich so shocked the world and showed the kind of war
p184
aVthat was being fought in Iraq.
p185
aVBut I wonder who remembers Joe Darby,
p186
aVthe very obedient, good soldier
p187
aVwho found those photographs and handed them in.
p188
aVAnd he said, "You know, I'm not the kind of guy
p189
aVto rat people out, but some things just cross the line.
p190
aVIgnorance is bliss, they say,
p191
aVbut you can't put up with things like this."
p192
aVI talked to Steve Bolsin, a British doctor,
p193
aVwho fought for five years to draw attention
p194
aVto a dangerous surgeon who was killing babies.
p195
aVAnd I asked him why he did it, and he said,
p196
aV"Well, it was really my daughter who prompted me to do it.
p197
aVShe came up to me one night, and she just said,
p198
aV'Dad, you can't let the kids die.'"
p199
aVOr I think of Cynthia Thomas,
p200
aVa really loyal army daughter and army wife,
p201
aVwho, as she saw her friends and relations
p202
aVcoming back from the Iraq War, was so shocked
p203
aVby their mental condition
p204
aVand the refusal of the military to recognize and acknowledge
p205
aVpost-traumatic stress syndrome
p206
aVthat she set up a cafe in the middle of a military town
p207
aVto give them legal, psychological and medical assistance.
p208
aVAnd she said to me, she said, "You know, Margaret,
p209
aVI always used to say I didn't know what I wanted to be
p210
aVwhen I grow up.
p211
aVBut I've found myself in this cause,
p212
aVand I'll never be the same."
p213
aVWe all enjoy so many freedoms today,
p214
aVhard-won freedoms:
p215
aVthe freedom to write and publish without fear of censorship,
p216
aVa freedom that wasn't here the last time I came to Hungary;
p217
aVa freedom to vote, which women in particular
p218
aVhad to fight so hard for;
p219
aVthe freedom for people of different ethnicities and cultures
p220
aVand sexual orientation to live the way that they want.
p221
aVBut freedom doesn't exist if you don't use it,
p222
aVand what whistleblowers do,
p223
aVand what people like Gayla Benefield do
p224
aVis they use the freedom that they have.
p225
aVAnd what they're very prepared to do is recognize
p226
aVthat yes, this is going to be an argument,
p227
aVand yes I'm going to have a lot of rows
p228
aVwith my neighbors and my colleagues and my friends,
p229
aVbut I'm going to become very good at this conflict.
p230
aVI'm going to take on the naysayers,
p231
aVbecause they'll make my argument better and stronger.
p232
aVI can collaborate with my opponents
p233
aVto become better at what I do.
p234
aVThese are people of immense persistence,
p235
aVincredible patience, and an absolute determination
p236
aVnot to be blind and not to be silent.
p237
aVWhen I went to Libby, Montana,
p238
aVI visited the asbestosis clinic
p239
aVthat Gayla Benefield brought into being,
p240
aVa place where at first some of the people
p241
aVwho wanted help and needed medical attention
p242
aVwent in the back door
p243
aVbecause they didn't want to acknowledge
p244
aVthat she'd been right.
p245
aVI sat in a diner, and I watched
p246
aVas trucks drove up and down the highway,
p247
aVcarting away the earth out of gardens
p248
aVand replacing it with fresh, uncontaminated soil.
p249
aVI took my 12-year-old daughter with me,
p250
aVbecause I really wanted her to meet Gayla.
p251
aVAnd she said, "Why? What's the big deal?"
p252
aVI said, "She's not a movie star,
p253
aVand she's not a celebrity, and she's not an expert,
p254
aVand Gayla's the first person who'd say
p255
aVshe's not a saint.
p256
aVThe really important thing about Gayla
p257
aVis she is ordinary.
p258
aVShe's like you, and she's like me.
p259
aVShe had freedom, and she was ready to use it."
p260
aVThank you very much.
