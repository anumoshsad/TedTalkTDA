VThree years ago, I was standing about a hundred yards
p4
aVfrom Chernobyl nuclear reactor number four.
p5
aVMy Geiger counter dosimeter, which measures radiation,
p6
aVwas going berserk,
p7
aVand the closer I got, the more frenetic it became,
p8
aVand frantic. My God.
p9
aa(lp10
VI was there covering the 25th anniversary
p11
aVof the world's worst nuclear accident,
p12
aVas you can see by the look on my face,
p13
aVreluctantly so, but with good reason,
p14
aVbecause the nuclear fire that burned for 11 days
p15
aVback in 1986 released 400 times as much radiation
p16
aVas the bomb dropped on Hiroshima,
p17
aVand the sarcophagus, which is the covering
p18
aVover reactor number four,
p19
aVwhich was hastily built 27 years ago,
p20
aVnow sits cracked and rusted
p21
aVand leaking radiation.
p22
aa(lp23
VSo I was filming.
p24
aVI just wanted to get the job done
p25
aVand get out of there fast.
p26
aVBut then, I looked into the distance,
p27
aVand I saw some smoke coming from a farmhouse,
p28
aVand I'm thinking, who could be living here?
p29
aVI mean, after all, Chernobyl's soil, water and air,
p30
aVare among the most highly contaminated on Earth,
p31
aVand the reactor sits at the the center of
p32
aVa tightly regulated exclusion zone, or dead zone,
p33
aVand it's a nuclear police state, complete with border guards.
p34
aVYou have to have dosimeter at all times, clicking away,
p35
aVyou have to have a government minder,
p36
aVand there's draconian radiation rules
p37
aVand constant contamination monitoring.
p38
aVThe point being, no human being
p39
aVshould be living anywhere near the dead zone.
p40
aVBut they are.
p41
aa(lp42
VIt turns out an unlikely community
p43
aVof some 200 people are living inside the zone.
p44
aVThey're called self-settlers.
p45
aVAnd almost all of them are women,
p46
aVthe men having shorter lifespans
p47
aVin part due to overuse of alcohol, cigarettes,
p48
aVif not radiation.
p49
aVHundreds of thousands of people were evacuated
p50
aVat the time of the accident,
p51
aVbut not everybody accepted that fate.
p52
aVThe women in the zone, now in their 70s and 80s,
p53
aVare the last survivors of a group who defied authorities
p54
aVand, it would seem, common sense,
p55
aVand returned to their ancestral homes inside the zone.
p56
aVThey did so illegally.
p57
aVAs one woman put it to a soldier
p58
aVwho was trying to evacuate her for a second time,
p59
aV"Shoot me and dig the grave.
p60
aVOtherwise, I'm going home."
p61
aa(lp62
VNow why would they return to such deadly soil?
p63
aVI mean, were they unaware of the risks
p64
aVor crazy enough to ignore them, or both?
p65
aVThe thing is, they see their lives
p66
aVand the risks they run decidedly differently.
p67
aa(lp68
VNow around Chernobyl, there are scattered ghost villages,
p69
aVeerily silent, strangely charming, bucolic,
p70
aVtotally contaminated.
p71
aVMany were bulldozed under at the time of the accident,
p72
aVbut a few are left like this,
p73
aVkind of silent vestiges to the tragedy.
p74
aVOthers have a few residents in them,
p75
aVone or two "babushkas," or "babas,"
p76
aVwhich are the Russian and Ukrainian words for grandmother.
p77
aVAnother village might have six or seven residents.
p78
aVSo this is the strange demographic of the zone \u2014
p79
aVisolated alone together.
p80
aa(lp81
VAnd when I made my way to that piping chimney
p82
aVI'd seen in the distance,
p83
aVI saw Hanna Zavorotnya, and I met her.
p84
aVShe's the self-declared mayor of Kapavati village,
p85
aVpopulation eight.
p86
aV(Laughter)
p87
aVAnd she said to me, when I asked her the obvious,
p88
aV"Radiation doesn't scare me. Starvation does."
p89
aa(lp90
VAnd you have to remember, these women have
p91
aVsurvived the worst atrocities of the 20th century.
p92
aVStalin's enforced famines of the 1930s, the Holodomor,
p93
aVkilled millions of Ukrainians,
p94
aVand they faced the Nazis in the '40s,
p95
aVwho came through slashing, burning, raping,
p96
aVand in fact many of these women
p97
aVwere shipped to Germany as forced labor.
p98
aVSo when a couple decades into Soviet rule,
p99
aVChernobyl happened,
p100
aVthey were unwilling to flee in the face of an enemy
p101
aVthat was invisible.
p102
aVSo they returned to their villages
p103
aVand are told they're going to get sick and die soon,
p104
aVbut five happy years, their logic goes,
p105
aVis better than 10 stuck in a high rise
p106
aVon the outskirts of Kiev,
p107
aVseparated from the graves of their mothers
p108
aVand fathers and babies,
p109
aVthe whisper of stork wings on a spring afternoon.
p110
aVFor them, environmental contamination
p111
aVmay not be the worst sort of devastation.
p112
aVIt turns out this holds true
p113
aVfor other species as well.
p114
aVWild boar, lynx, moose, they've all returned
p115
aVto the region in force,
p116
aVthe very real, very negative effects of radiation
p117
aVbeing trumped by the upside of a mass exodus
p118
aVof humans.
p119
aVThe dead zone, it turns out, is full of life.
p120
aa(lp121
VAnd there is a kind of heroic resilience,
p122
aVa kind of plain-spoken pragmatism to those
p123
aVwho start their day at 5 a.m.
p124
aVpulling water from a well
p125
aVand end it at midnight
p126
aVpoised to beat a bucket with a stick
p127
aVand scare off wild boar that might mess with their potatoes,
p128
aVtheir only company a bit of homemade moonshine vodka.
p129
aVAnd there's a patina of simple defiance among them.
p130
aV"They told us our legs would hurt, and they do. So what?"
p131
aVI mean, what about their health?
p132
aVThe benefits of hardy, physical living,
p133
aVbut an environment made toxic
p134
aVby a complicated, little-understood enemy, radiation.
p135
aVIt's incredibly difficult to parse.
p136
aVHealth studies from the region
p137
aVare conflicting and fraught.
p138
aVThe World Health Organization
p139
aVputs the number of Chernobyl-related deaths
p140
aVat 4,000, eventually.
p141
aVGreenpeace and other organizations
p142
aVput that number in the tens of thousands.
p143
aVNow everybody agrees that thyroid cancers
p144
aVare sky high, and that Chernobyl evacuees
p145
aVsuffer the trauma of relocated peoples everywhere:
p146
aVhigher levels of anxiety, depression, alcoholism,
p147
aVunemployment and, importantly,
p148
aVdisrupted social networks.
p149
aa(lp150
VNow, like many of you,
p151
aVI have moved maybe 20, 25 times in my life.
p152
aVHome is a transient concept.
p153
aVI have a deeper connection to my laptop
p154
aVthan any bit of soil.
p155
aVSo it's hard for us to understand, but home
p156
aVis the entire cosmos of the rural babushka,
p157
aVand connection to the land is palpable.
p158
aVAnd perhaps because these Ukrainian women
p159
aVwere schooled under the Soviets
p160
aVand versed in the Russian poets,
p161
aVaphorisms about these ideas
p162
aVslip from their mouths all the time.
p163
aa(lp164
V"If you leave, you die."
p165
aa(lp166
V"Those who left are worse off now.
p167
aVThey are dying of sadness."
p168
aa(lp169
V"Motherland is motherland. I will never leave."
p170
aa(lp171
VWhat sounds like faith, soft faith,
p172
aVmay actually be fact,
p173
aVbecause the surprising truth \u2014
p174
aVI mean, there are no studies, but the truth seems to be
p175
aVthat these women who returned to their homes
p176
aVand have lived on some of the most radioactive land
p177
aVon Earth for the last 27 years,
p178
aVhave actually outlived their counterparts
p179
aVwho accepted relocation,
p180
aVby some estimates up to 10 years.
p181
aa(lp182
VHow could this be?
p183
aVHere's a theory: Could it be
p184
aVthat those ties to ancestral soil,
p185
aVthe soft variables reflected in their aphorisms,
p186
aVactually affect longevity?
p187
aVThe power of motherland
p188
aVso fundamental to that part of the world
p189
aVseems palliative.
p190
aVHome and community are forces
p191
aVthat rival even radiation.
p192
aa(lp193
VNow radiation or not,
p194
aVthese women are at the end of their lives.
p195
aVIn the next decade, the zone's human residents will be gone,
p196
aVand it will revert to a wild, radioactive place,
p197
aVfull only of animals and occasionally
p198
aVdaring, flummoxed scientists.
p199
aVBut the spirit and existence of the babushkas,
p200
aVwhose numbers have been halved
p201
aVin the three years I've known them,
p202
aVwill leave us with powerful new templates
p203
aVto think about and grapple with,
p204
aVabout the relative nature of risk,
p205
aVabout transformative connections to home,
p206
aVand about the magnificent tonic
p207
aVof personal agency and self-determination.
