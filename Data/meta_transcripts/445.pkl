VHow can we investigate
p4
aVthis flora of viruses that surround us, and aid medicine?
p5
aVHow can we turn our cumulative knowledge of virology
p6
aVinto a simple, hand-held, single diagnostic assay?
p7
aVI want to turn everything we know right now about detecting viruses
p8
aVand the spectrum of viruses that are out there
p9
aVinto, let's say, a small chip.
p10
aa(lp11
VWhen we started thinking about this project \u2014
p12
aVhow we would make a single diagnostic assay
p13
aVto screen for all pathogens simultaneously \u2014
p14
aVwell, there's some problems with this idea.
p15
aVFirst of all, viruses are pretty complex,
p16
aVbut they're also evolving very fast.
p17
aVThis is a picornavirus.
p18
aVPicornaviruses \u2014 these are things that include
p19
aVthe common cold and polio, things like this.
p20
aVYou're looking at the outside shell of the virus,
p21
aVand the yellow color here are those parts of the virus
p22
aVthat are evolving very, very fast,
p23
aVand the blue parts are not evolving very fast.
p24
aVWhen people think about making pan-viral detection reagents,
p25
aVusually it's the fast-evolving problem that's an issue,
p26
aVbecause how can we detect things if they're always changing?
p27
aVBut evolution is a balance:
p28
aVwhere you have fast change, you also have ultra-conservation \u2014
p29
aVthings that almost never change.
p30
aa(lp31
VAnd so we looked into this a little more carefully,
p32
aVand I'm going to show you data now.
p33
aVThis is just some stuff you can do on the computer from the desktop.
p34
aVI took a bunch of these small picornaviruses,
p35
aVlike the common cold, like polio and so on,
p36
aVand I just broke them down into small segments.
p37
aVAnd so took this first example, which is called coxsackievirus,
p38
aVand just break it into small windows.
p39
aVAnd I'm coloring these small windows blue
p40
aVif another virus shares an identical sequence in its genome
p41
aVto that virus.
p42
aVThese sequences right up here \u2014
p43
aVwhich don't even code for protein, by the way \u2014
p44
aVare almost absolutely identical across all of these,
p45
aVso I could use this sequence as a marker
p46
aVto detect a wide spectrum of viruses,
p47
aVwithout having to make something individual.
p48
aVNow, over here there's great diversity:
p49
aVthat's where things are evolving fast.
p50
aVDown here you can see slower evolution: less diversity.
p51
aa(lp52
VNow, by the time we get out here to, let's say,
p53
aVacute bee paralysis virus \u2014
p54
aVprobably a bad one to have if you're a bee \u2014-
p55
aVthis virus shares almost no similarity to coxsackievirus,
p56
aVbut I can guarantee you that the sequences that are most conserved
p57
aVamong these viruses on the right-hand of the screen
p58
aVare in identical regions right up here.
p59
aVAnd so we can encapsulate these regions of ultra-conservation
p60
aVthrough evolution \u2014 how these viruses evolved \u2014
p61
aVby just choosing DNA elements or RNA elements
p62
aVin these regions to represent on our chip as detection reagents.
p63
aa(lp64
VOK, so that's what we did, but how are we going to do that?
p65
aVWell, for a long time, since I was in graduate school,
p66
aVI've been messing around making DNA chips \u2014
p67
aVthat is, printing DNA on glass.
p68
aVAnd that's what you see here:
p69
aVThese little salt spots are just DNA tacked onto glass,
p70
aVand so I can put thousands of these on our glass chip
p71
aVand use them as a detection reagent.
p72
aVWe took our chip over to Hewlett-Packard
p73
aVand used their atomic force microscope on one of these spots,
p74
aVand this is what you see:
p75
aVyou can actually see the strands of DNA lying flat on the glass here.
p76
aVSo, what we're doing is just printing DNA on glass \u2014
p77
aVlittle flat things \u2014 and these are going to be markers for pathogens.
p78
aVOK, I make little robots in lab to make these chips,
p79
aVand I'm really big on disseminating technology.
p80
aVIf you've got enough money to buy just a Camry,
p81
aVyou can build one of these too,
p82
aVand so we put a deep how-to guide on the Web, totally free,
p83
aVwith basically order-off-the-shelf parts.
p84
aVYou can build a DNA array machine in your garage.
p85
aVHere's the section on the all-important emergency stop switch.
p86
aV(Laughter)
p87
aVEvery important machine's got to have a big red button.
p88
aVBut really, it's pretty robust.
p89
aVYou can actually be making DNA chips in your garage
p90
aVand decoding some genetic programs pretty rapidly. It's a lot of fun.
p91
aV(Laughter)
p92
aa(lp93
VAnd so what we did \u2014 and this is a really cool project \u2014
p94
aVwe just started by making a respiratory virus chip.
p95
aVI talked about that \u2014
p96
aVyou know, that situation where you go into the clinic
p97
aVand you don't get diagnosed?
p98
aVWell, we just put basically all the human respiratory viruses
p99
aVon one chip, and we threw in herpes virus for good measure \u2014
p100
aVI mean, why not?
p101
aVThe first thing you do as a scientist is,
p102
aVyou make sure stuff works.
p103
aVAnd so what we did is, we take tissue culture cells
p104
aVand infect them with various viruses,
p105
aVand we take the stuff and fluorescently label the nucleic acid,
p106
aVthe genetic material that comes out of these tissue culture cells \u2014
p107
aVmostly viral stuff \u2014 and stick it on the array to see where it sticks.
p108
aVNow, if the DNA sequences match, they'll stick together,
p109
aVand so we can look at spots.
p110
aVAnd if spots light up, we know there's a certain virus in there.
p111
aa(lp112
VThat's what one of these chips really looks like,
p113
aVand these red spots are, in fact, signals coming from the virus.
p114
aVAnd each spot represents a different family of virus
p115
aVor species of virus.
p116
aVAnd so, that's a hard way to look at things,
p117
aVso I'm just going to encode things as a little barcode,
p118
aVgrouped by family, so you can see the results in a very intuitive way.
p119
aVWhat we did is, we took tissue culture cells
p120
aVand infected them with adenovirus,
p121
aVand you can see this little yellow barcode next to adenovirus.
p122
aVAnd, likewise, we infected them with parainfluenza-3 \u2014
p123
aVthat's a paramyxovirus \u2014 and you see a little barcode here.
p124
aVAnd then we did respiratory syncytial virus.
p125
aVThat's the scourge of daycare centers everywhere \u2014
p126
aVit's like boogeremia, basically.
p127
aV(Laughter)
p128
aVYou can see that this barcode is the same family,
p129
aVbut it's distinct from parainfluenza-3,
p130
aVwhich gives you a very bad cold.
p131
aVAnd so we're getting unique signatures, a fingerprint for each virus.
p132
aVPolio and rhino: they're in the same family, very close to each other.
p133
aVRhino's the common cold, and you all know what polio is,
p134
aVand you can see that these signatures are distinct.
p135
aVAnd Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus
p136
aVgives a nice signature down here.
p137
aVAnd so it is not any one stripe or something
p138
aVthat tells me I have a virus of a particular type here;
p139
aVit's the barcode that in bulk represents the whole thing.
p140
aa(lp141
VAll right, I can see a rhinovirus \u2014
p142
aVand here's the blow-up of the rhinovirus's little barcode \u2014
p143
aVbut what about different rhinoviruses?
p144
aVHow do I know which rhinovirus I have?
p145
aVThere're 102 known variants of the common cold,
p146
aVand there're only 102 because people got bored collecting them:
p147
aVthere are just new ones every year.
p148
aVAnd so, here are four different rhinoviruses,
p149
aVand you can see, even with your eye,
p150
aVwithout any fancy computer pattern-matching
p151
aVrecognition software algorithms,
p152
aVthat you can distinguish each one of these barcodes from each other.
p153
aa(lp154
VNow, this is kind of a cheap shot,
p155
aVbecause I know what the genetic sequence of all these rhinoviruses is,
p156
aVand I in fact designed the chip
p157
aVexpressly to be able to tell them apart,
p158
aVbut what about rhinoviruses that have never seen a genetic sequencer?
p159
aVWe don't know what the sequence is; just pull them out of the field.
p160
aVSo, here are four rhinoviruses
p161
aVwe never knew anything about \u2014
p162
aVno one's ever sequenced them \u2014 and you can also see
p163
aVthat you get unique and distinguishable patterns.
p164
aVYou can imagine building up some library, whether real or virtual,
p165
aVof fingerprints of essentially every virus.
p166
aVBut that's, again, shooting fish in a barrel, you know, right?
p167
aVYou have tissue culture cells. There are a ton of viruses.
p168
aVWhat about real people?
p169
aVYou can't control real people, as you probably know.
p170
aVYou have no idea what someone's going to cough into a cup,
p171
aVand it's probably really complex, right?
p172
aVIt could have lots of bacteria, it could have more than one virus,
p173
aVand it certainly has host genetic material.
p174
aVSo how do we deal with this?
p175
aVAnd how do we do the positive control here?
p176
aa(lp177
VWell, it's pretty simple.
p178
aVThat's me, getting a nasal lavage.
p179
aVAnd the idea is, let's experimentally inoculate people with virus.
p180
aVThis is all IRB-approved, by the way; they got paid.
p181
aVAnd basically we experimentally inoculate people
p182
aVwith the common cold virus.
p183
aVOr, even better, let's just take people
p184
aVright out of the emergency room \u2014
p185
aVundefined, community-acquired respiratory tract infections.
p186
aVYou have no idea what walks in through the door.
p187
aVSo, let's start off with the positive control first,
p188
aVwhere we know the person was healthy.
p189
aVThey got a shot of virus up the nose,
p190
aVlet's see what happens.
p191
aa(lp192
VDay zero: nothing happening.
p193
aVThey're healthy; they're clean \u2014 it's amazing.
p194
aVActually, we thought the nasal tract might be full of viruses
p195
aVeven when you're walking around healthy.
p196
aVIt's pretty clean. If you're healthy, you're pretty healthy.
p197
aVDay two: we get a very robust rhinovirus pattern,
p198
aVand it's very similar to what we get in the lab
p199
aVdoing our tissue culture experiment.
p200
aVSo that's great, but again, cheap shot, right?
p201
aVWe put a ton of virus up this guy's nose. So \u2014
p202
aV(Laughter)
p203
aV\u2014 I mean, we wanted it to work. He really had a cold.
p204
aVSo, how about the people who walk in off the street?
p205
aa(lp206
VHere are two individuals represented by their anonymous ID codes.
p207
aVThey both have rhinoviruses; we've never seen this pattern in lab.
p208
aVWe sequenced part of their viruses;
p209
aVthey're new rhinoviruses no one's actually even seen.
p210
aVRemember, our evolutionary-conserved sequences
p211
aVwe're using on this array allow us to detect
p212
aVeven novel or uncharacterized viruses,
p213
aVbecause we pick what is conserved throughout evolution.
p214
aVHere's another guy. You can play the diagnosis game yourself here.
p215
aVThese different blocks represent
p216
aVthe different viruses in this paramyxovirus family,
p217
aVso you can kind of go down the blocks
p218
aVand see where the signal is.
p219
aVWell, doesn't have canine distemper; that's probably good.
p220
aV(Laughter)
p221
aVBut by the time you get to block nine,
p222
aVyou see that respiratory syncytial virus.
p223
aVMaybe they have kids. And then you can see, also,
p224
aVthe family member that's related: RSVB is showing up here.
p225
aVSo, that's great.
p226
aVHere's another individual, sampled on two separate days \u2014
p227
aVrepeat visits to the clinic.
p228
aVThis individual has parainfluenza-1,
p229
aVand you can see that there's a little stripe over here
p230
aVfor Sendai virus: that's mouse parainfluenza.
p231
aVThe genetic relationships are very close there. That's a lot of fun.
p232
aa(lp233
VSo, we built out the chip.
p234
aVWe made a chip that has every known virus ever discovered on it.
p235
aVWhy not? Every plant virus, every insect virus, every marine virus.
p236
aVEverything that we could get out of GenBank \u2014
p237
aVthat is, the national repository of sequences.
p238
aVNow we're using this chip. And what are we using it for?
p239
aVWell, first of all, when you have a big chip like this,
p240
aVyou need a little bit more informatics,
p241
aVso we designed the system to do automatic diagnosis.
p242
aVAnd the idea is that we simply have virtual patterns,
p243
aVbecause we're never going to get samples of every virus \u2014
p244
aVit would be virtually impossible. But we can get virtual patterns,
p245
aVand compare them to our observed result \u2014
p246
aVwhich is a very complex mixture \u2014 and come up with some sort of score
p247
aVof how likely it is this is a rhinovirus or something.
p248
aVAnd this is what this looks like.
p249
aVIf, for example, you used a cell culture
p250
aVthat's chronically infected with papilloma,
p251
aVyou get a little computer readout here,
p252
aVand our algorithm says it's probably papilloma type 18.
p253
aVAnd that is, in fact, what these particular cell cultures
p254
aVare chronically infected with.
p255
aa(lp256
VSo let's do something a little bit harder.
p257
aVWe put the beeper in the clinic.
p258
aVWhen somebody shows up, and the hospital doesn't know what to do
p259
aVbecause they can't diagnose it, they call us.
p260
aVThat's the idea, and we're setting this up in the Bay Area.
p261
aVAnd so, this case report happened three weeks ago.
p262
aVWe have a 28-year-old healthy woman, no travel history,
p263
aV[unclear], doesn't smoke, doesn't drink.
p264
aV10-day history of fevers, night sweats, bloody sputum \u2014
p265
aVshe's coughing up blood \u2014 muscle pain.
p266
aVShe went to the clinic, and they gave her antibiotics
p267
aVand then sent her home.
p268
aVShe came back after ten days of fever, right? Still has the fever,
p269
aVand she's hypoxic \u2014 she doesn't have much oxygen in her lungs.
p270
aVThey did a CT scan.
p271
aVA normal lung is all sort of dark and black here.
p272
aVAll this white stuff \u2014 it's not good.
p273
aVThis sort of tree and bud formation indicates there's inflammation;
p274
aVthere's likely to be infection.
p275
aVOK. So, the patient was treated then
p276
aVwith a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic and doxycycline,
p277
aVand on day three, it didn't help: she had progressed to acute failure.
p278
aVThey had to intubate her, so they put a tube down her throat
p279
aVand they began to mechanically ventilate her.
p280
aVShe could no longer breathe for herself.
p281
aVWhat to do next? Don't know.
p282
aVSwitch antibiotics: so they switched to another antibiotic,
p283
aVTamiflu.
p284
aVIt's not clear why they thought she had the flu,
p285
aVbut they switched to Tamiflu.
p286
aa(lp287
VAnd on day six, they basically threw in the towel.
p288
aVYou do an open lung biopsy when you've got no other options.
p289
aVThere's an eight percent mortality rate with just doing this procedure,
p290
aVand so basically \u2014 and what do they learn from it?
p291
aVYou're looking at her open lung biopsy.
p292
aVAnd I'm no pathologist, but you can't tell much from this.
p293
aVAll you can tell is, there's a lot of swelling: bronchiolitis.
p294
aVIt was "unrevealing": that's the pathologist's report.
p295
aVAnd so, what did they test her for?
p296
aVThey have their own tests, of course,
p297
aVand so they tested her for over 70 different assays,
p298
aVfor every sort of bacteria and fungus and viral assay
p299
aVyou can buy off the shelf:
p300
aVSARS, metapneumovirus, HIV, RSV \u2014 all these.
p301
aVEverything came back negative, over 100,000 dollars worth of tests.
p302
aVI mean, they went to the max for this woman.
p303
aa(lp304
VAnd basically on hospital day eight, that's when they called us.
p305
aVThey gave us endotracheal aspirate \u2014
p306
aVyou know, a little fluid from the throat,
p307
aVfrom this tube that they got down there \u2014 and they gave us this.
p308
aVWe put it on the chip; what do we see? Well, we saw parainfluenza-4.
p309
aVWell, what the hell's parainfluenza-4?
p310
aVNo one tests for parainfluenza-4. No one cares about it.
p311
aVIn fact, it's not even really sequenced that much.
p312
aVThere's just a little bit of it sequenced.
p313
aVThere's almost no epidemiology or studies on it.
p314
aVNo one would even consider it,
p315
aVbecause no one had a clue that it could cause respiratory failure.
p316
aVAnd why is that? Just lore. There's no data \u2014
p317
aVno data to support whether it causes severe or mild disease.
p318
aVClearly, we have a case of a healthy person that's going down.
p319
aa(lp320
VOK, that's one case report.
p321
aVI'm going to tell you one last thing in the last two minutes
p322
aVthat's unpublished \u2014 it's going to come out tomorrow \u2014
p323
aVand it's an interesting case of how you might use this chip
p324
aVto find something new and open a new door.
p325
aVProstate cancer. I don't need to give you many statistics
p326
aVabout prostate cancer. Most of you already know it:
p327
aVthird leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S.
p328
aVLots of risk factors,
p329
aVbut there is a genetic predisposition to prostate cancer.
p330
aVFor maybe about 10 percent of prostate cancer,
p331
aVthere are folks that are predisposed to it.
p332
aVAnd the first gene that was mapped in association studies
p333
aVfor this, early-onset prostate cancer, was this gene called RNASEL.
p334
aVWhat is that? It's an antiviral defense enzyme.
p335
aVSo, we're sitting around and thinking,
p336
aV"Why would men who have the mutation \u2014
p337
aVa defect in an antiviral defense system \u2014 get prostate cancer?
p338
aVIt doesn't make sense \u2014 unless, maybe, there's a virus?"
p339
aa(lp340
VSo, we put tumors \u2014- and now we have over 100 tumors \u2014 on our array.
p341
aVAnd we know who's got defects in RNASEL and who doesn't.
p342
aVAnd I'm showing you the signal from the chip here,
p343
aVand I'm showing you for the block of retroviral oligos.
p344
aVAnd what I'm telling you here from the signal, is
p345
aVthat men who have a mutation in this antiviral defense enzyme,
p346
aVand have a tumor, often have \u2014 40 percent of the time \u2014
p347
aVa signature which reveals a new retrovirus.
p348
aVOK, that's pretty wild. What is it?
p349
aVSo, we clone the whole virus.
p350
aVFirst of all, I'll tell you that a little automated prediction told us
p351
aVit was very similar to a mouse virus.
p352
aVBut that doesn't tell us too much,
p353
aVso we actually clone the whole thing.
p354
aVAnd the viral genome I'm showing you right here?
p355
aVIt's a classic gamma retrovirus, but it's totally new;
p356
aVno one's ever seen it before.
p357
aVIts closest relative is, in fact, from mice,
p358
aVand so we would call this a xenotropic retrovirus,
p359
aVbecause it's infecting a species other than mice.
p360
aVAnd this is a little phylogenetic tree
p361
aVto see how it's related to other viruses.
p362
aVWe've done it for many patients now,
p363
aVand we can say that they're all independent infections.
p364
aVThey all have the same virus,
p365
aVbut they're different enough that there's reason to believe
p366
aVthat they've been independently acquired.
p367
aVIs it really in the tissue? And I'll end up with this: yes.
p368
aVWe take slices of these biopsies of tumor tissue
p369
aVand use material to actually locate the virus,
p370
aVand we find cells here with viral particles in them.
p371
aVThese guys really do have this virus.
p372
aa(lp373
VDoes this virus cause prostate cancer?
p374
aVNothing I'm saying here implies causality. I don't know.
p375
aVIs it a link to oncogenesis? I don't know.
p376
aVIs it the case that these guys are just more susceptible to viruses?
p377
aVCould be. And it might have nothing to do with cancer.
p378
aVBut now it's a door.
p379
aVWe have a strong association between the presence of this virus
p380
aVand a genetic mutation that's been linked to cancer.
p381
aVThat's where we're at.
p382
aVSo, it opens up more questions than it answers, I'm afraid,
p383
aVbut that's what, you know, science is really good at.
p384
aVThis was all done by folks in the lab \u2014
p385
aVI cannot take credit for most of this.
p386
aVThis is a collaboration between myself and Don.
p387
aVThis is the guy who started the project in my lab,
p388
aVand this is the guy who's been doing prostate stuff.
