VSo when I was eight years old,
p4
aVa new girl came to join the class,
p5
aVand she was so impressive,
p6
aVas the new girl always seems to be.
p7
aVShe had vast quantities of very shiny hair
p8
aVand a cute little pencil case,
p9
aVsuper strong on state capitals,
p10
aVjust a great speller.
p11
aVAnd I just curdled with jealousy that year,
p12
aVuntil I hatched my devious plan.
p13
aVSo one day I stayed a little late after school,
p14
aVa little too late, and I lurked in the girls' bathroom.
p15
aVWhen the coast was clear, I emerged,
p16
aVcrept into the classroom,
p17
aVand took from my teacher's desk the grade book.
p18
aVAnd then I did it.
p19
aVI fiddled with my rival's grades,
p20
aVjust a little, just demoted some of those A's.
p21
aVAll of those A's. (Laughter)
p22
aVAnd I got ready to return the book to the drawer,
p23
aVwhen hang on, some of my other classmates
p24
aVhad appallingly good grades too.
p25
aVSo, in a frenzy,
p26
aVI corrected everybody's marks,
p27
aVnot imaginatively.
p28
aVI gave everybody a row of D's
p29
aVand I gave myself a row of A's,
p30
aVjust because I was there, you know, might as well.
p31
aa(lp32
VAnd I am still baffled by my behavior.
p33
aVI don't understand where the idea came from.
p34
aVI don't understand why I felt so great doing it.
p35
aVI felt great.
p36
aVI don't understand why I was never caught.
p37
aVI mean, it should have been so blatantly obvious.
p38
aVI was never caught.
p39
aVBut most of all, I am baffled by,
p40
aVwhy did it bother me so much
p41
aVthat this little girl, this tiny little girl,
p42
aVwas so good at spelling?
p43
aVJealousy baffles me.
p44
aVIt's so mysterious, and it's so pervasive.
p45
aVWe know babies suffer from jealousy.
p46
aVWe know primates do. Bluebirds are actually very prone.
p47
aVWe know that jealousy is the number one cause
p48
aVof spousal murder in the United States.
p49
aVAnd yet, I have never read a study
p50
aVthat can parse to me its loneliness
p51
aVor its longevity or its grim thrill.
p52
aVFor that, we have to go to fiction,
p53
aVbecause the novel is the lab
p54
aVthat has studied jealousy
p55
aVin every possible configuration.
p56
aVIn fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say
p57
aVthat if we didn't have jealousy,
p58
aVwould we even have literature?
p59
aVWell no faithless Helen, no "Odyssey."
p60
aVNo jealous king, no "Arabian Nights."
p61
aVNo Shakespeare.
p62
aVThere goes high school reading lists,
p63
aVbecause we're losing "Sound and the Fury,"
p64
aVwe're losing "Gatsby," "Sun Also Rises,"
p65
aVwe're losing "Madame Bovary," "Anna K."
p66
aVNo jealousy, no Proust. And now, I mean,
p67
aVI know it's fashionable to say that Proust
p68
aVhas the answers to everything,
p69
aVbut in the case of jealousy,
p70
aVhe kind of does.
p71
aVThis year is the centennial of his masterpiece, "In Search of Lost Time,"
p72
aVand it's the most exhaustive study of sexual jealousy
p73
aVand just regular competitiveness, my brand,
p74
aVthat we can hope to have. (Laughter)
p75
aVAnd we think about Proust, we think
p76
aVabout the sentimental bits, right?
p77
aVWe think about a little boy trying to get to sleep.
p78
aVWe think about a madeleine moistened in lavender tea.
p79
aVWe forget how harsh his vision was.
p80
aVWe forget how pitiless he is.
p81
aVI mean, these are books that Virginia Woolf said
p82
aVwere tough as cat gut.
p83
aVI don't know what cat gut is,
p84
aVbut let's assume it's formidable.
p85
aa(lp86
VLet's look at why they go so well together,
p87
aVthe novel and jealousy, jealousy and Proust.
p88
aVIs it something as obvious as that jealousy,
p89
aVwhich boils down into person, desire, impediment,
p90
aVis such a solid narrative foundation?
p91
aVI don't know. I think it cuts very close to the bone,
p92
aVbecause let's think about what happens
p93
aVwhen we feel jealous.
p94
aVWhen we feel jealous, we tell ourselves a story.
p95
aVWe tell ourselves a story about other people's lives,
p96
aVand these stories make us feel terrible
p97
aVbecause they're designed to make us feel terrible.
p98
aVAs the teller of the tale and the audience,
p99
aVwe know just what details to include,
p100
aVto dig that knife in. Right?
p101
aVJealousy makes us all amateur novelists,
p102
aVand this is something Proust understood.
p103
aa(lp104
VIn the first volume, Swann's Way,
p105
aVthe series of books,
p106
aVSwann, one of the main characters,
p107
aVis thinking very fondly of his mistress
p108
aVand how great she is in bed,
p109
aVand suddenly, in the course of a few sentences,
p110
aVand these are Proustian sentences,
p111
aVso they're long as rivers,
p112
aVbut in the course of a few sentences,
p113
aVhe suddenly recoils and he realizes,
p114
aV"Hang on, everything I love about this woman,
p115
aVsomebody else would love about this woman.
p116
aVEverything that she does that gives me pleasure
p117
aVcould be giving somebody else pleasure,
p118
aVmaybe right about now."
p119
aVAnd this is the story he starts to tell himself,
p120
aVand from then on, Proust writes that
p121
aVevery fresh charm Swann detects in his mistress,
p122
aVhe adds to his "collection of instruments
p123
aVin his private torture chamber."
p124
aa(lp125
VNow Swann and Proust, we have to admit,
p126
aVwere notoriously jealous.
p127
aVYou know, Proust's boyfriends would have to leave
p128
aVthe country if they wanted to break up with him.
p129
aVBut you don't have to be that jealous
p130
aVto concede that it's hard work. Right?
p131
aVJealousy is exhausting.
p132
aVIt's a hungry emotion. It must be fed.
p133
aa(lp134
VAnd what does jealousy like?
p135
aVJealousy likes information.
p136
aVJealousy likes details.
p137
aVJealousy likes the vast quantities of shiny hair,
p138
aVthe cute little pencil case.
p139
aVJealousy likes photos.
p140
aVThat's why Instagram is such a hit. (Laughter)
p141
aVProust actually links the language of scholarship and jealousy.
p142
aVWhen Swann is in his jealous throes,
p143
aVand suddenly he's listening at doorways
p144
aVand bribing his mistress' servants,
p145
aVhe defends these behaviors.
p146
aVHe says, "You know, look, I know you think this is repugnant,
p147
aVbut it is no different
p148
aVfrom interpreting an ancient text
p149
aVor looking at a monument."
p150
aVHe says, "They are scientific investigations
p151
aVwith real intellectual value."
p152
aVProust is trying to show us that jealousy
p153
aVfeels intolerable and makes us look absurd,
p154
aVbut it is, at its crux, a quest for knowledge,
p155
aVa quest for truth, painful truth,
p156
aVand actually, where Proust is concerned,
p157
aVthe more painful the truth, the better.
p158
aVGrief, humiliation, loss:
p159
aVThese were the avenues to wisdom for Proust.
p160
aVHe says, "A woman whom we need,
p161
aVwho makes us suffer, elicits from us
p162
aVa gamut of feelings far more profound and vital
p163
aVthan a man of genius who interests us."
p164
aVIs he telling us to just go and find cruel women?
p165
aVNo. I think he's trying to say
p166
aVthat jealousy reveals us to ourselves.
p167
aVAnd does any other emotion crack us open
p168
aVin this particular way?
p169
aVDoes any other emotion reveal to us
p170
aVour aggression and our hideous ambition
p171
aVand our entitlement?
p172
aVDoes any other emotion teach us to look
p173
aVwith such peculiar intensity?
p174
aa(lp175
VFreud would write about this later.
p176
aVOne day, Freud was visited
p177
aVby this very anxious young man who was consumed
p178
aVwith the thought of his wife cheating on him.
p179
aVAnd Freud says, it's something strange about this guy,
p180
aVbecause he's not looking at what his wife is doing.
p181
aVBecause she's blameless; everybody knows it.
p182
aVThe poor creature is just
p183
aVunder suspicion for no cause.
p184
aVBut he's looking for things that his wife is doing
p185
aVwithout noticing, unintentional behaviors.
p186
aVIs she smiling too brightly here,
p187
aVor did she accidentally brush up against a man there?
p188
aV[Freud] says that the man is becoming
p189
aVthe custodian of his wife's unconscious.
p190
aa(lp191
VThe novel is very good on this point.
p192
aVThe novel is very good at describing how jealousy
p193
aVtrains us to look with intensity but not accuracy.
p194
aVIn fact, the more intensely jealous we are,
p195
aVthe more we become residents of fantasy.
p196
aVAnd this is why, I think, jealousy doesn't
p197
aVjust provoke us to do violent things
p198
aVor illegal things.
p199
aVJealousy prompts us to behave in ways
p200
aVthat are wildly inventive.
p201
aVNow I'm thinking of myself at eight, I concede,
p202
aVbut I'm also thinking of this story I heard on the news.
p203
aVA 52-year-old Michigan woman was caught
p204
aVcreating a fake Facebook account
p205
aVfrom which she sent vile, hideous messages
p206
aVto herself for a year.
p207
aVFor a year. A year.
p208
aVAnd she was trying to frame
p209
aVher ex-boyfriend's new girlfriend,
p210
aVand I have to confess when I heard this,
p211
aVI just reacted with admiration.
p212
aV(Laughter)
p213
aVBecause, I mean, let's be real.
p214
aVWhat immense, if misplaced, creativity. Right?
p215
aVThis is something from a novel.
p216
aVThis is something from a Patricia Highsmith novel.
p217
aa(lp218
VNow Highsmith is a particular favorite of mine.
p219
aVShe is the very brilliant and bizarre woman of American letters.
p220
aVShe's the author of "Strangers on a Train"
p221
aVand "The Talented Mr. Ripley,"
p222
aVbooks that are all about how jealousy,
p223
aVit muddles our minds,
p224
aVand once we're in the sphere, in that realm of jealousy,
p225
aVthe membrane between what is and what could be
p226
aVcan be pierced in an instant.
p227
aVTake Tom Ripley, her most famous character.
p228
aVNow, Tom Ripley goes from wanting you
p229
aVor wanting what you have
p230
aVto being you and having what you once had,
p231
aVand you're under the floorboards,
p232
aVhe's answering to your name,
p233
aVhe's wearing your rings,
p234
aVemptying your bank account.
p235
aVThat's one way to go.
p236
aa(lp237
VBut what do we do? We can't go the Tom Ripley route.
p238
aVI can't give the world D's,
p239
aVas much as I would really like to, some days.
p240
aVAnd it's a pity, because we live in envious times.
p241
aVWe live in jealous times.
p242
aVI mean, we're all good citizens of social media,
p243
aVaren't we, where the currency is envy?
p244
aa(lp245
VDoes the novel show us a way out? I'm not sure.
p246
aVSo let's do what characters always do when they're not sure,
p247
aVwhen they are in possession of a mystery.
p248
aVLet's go to 221B Baker Street
p249
aVand ask for Sherlock Holmes.
p250
aVWhen people think of Holmes,
p251
aVthey think of his nemesis being Professor Moriarty,
p252
aVright, this criminal mastermind.
p253
aVBut I've always preferred [Inspector] Lestrade,
p254
aVwho is the rat-faced head of Scotland Yard
p255
aVwho needs Holmes desperately,
p256
aVneeds Holmes' genius, but resents him.
p257
aVOh, it's so familiar to me.
p258
aVSo Lestrade needs his help, resents him,
p259
aVand sort of seethes with bitterness over the course of the mysteries.
p260
aVBut as they work together, something starts to change,
p261
aVand finally in "The Adventure of the Six Napoleons,"
p262
aVonce Holmes comes in, dazzles everybody with his solution,
p263
aVLestrade turns to Holmes and he says,
p264
aV"We're not jealous of you, Mr. Holmes.
p265
aVWe're proud of you."
p266
aVAnd he says that there's not a man at Scotland Yard
p267
aVwho wouldn't want to shake Sherlock Holmes' hand.
p268
aa(lp269
VIt's one of the few times we see Holmes moved
p270
aVin the mysteries, and I find it very moving,
p271
aVthis little scene, but it's also mysterious, right?
p272
aVIt seems to treat jealousy
p273
aVas a problem of geometry, not emotion.
p274
aVYou know, one minute Holmes is on the other side from Lestrade.
p275
aVThe next minute they're on the same side.
p276
aVSuddenly, Lestrade is letting himself
p277
aVadmire this mind that he's resented.
p278
aVCould it be so simple though?
p279
aVWhat if jealousy really is a matter of geometry,
p280
aVjust a matter of where we allow ourselves to stand
p281
aVin relation to another?
p282
aVWell, maybe then we wouldn't have to resent
p283
aVsomebody's excellence.
p284
aVWe could align ourselves with it.
p285
aa(lp286
VBut I like contingency plans.
p287
aVSo while we wait for that to happen,
p288
aVlet us remember that we have fiction for consolation.
p289
aVFiction alone demystifies jealousy.
p290
aVFiction alone domesticates it,
p291
aVinvites it to the table.
p292
aVAnd look who it gathers:
p293
aVsweet Lestrade, terrifying Tom Ripley,
p294
aVcrazy Swann, Marcel Proust himself.
p295
aVWe are in excellent company.
p296
aVThank you.
