VI am known best for human-powered flight,
p4
aVbut that was just one thing that got me going
p5
aVin the sort of things that I'm working in now.
p6
aVAs a youngster, I was very interested in model airplanes,
p7
aVornithopters, autogyros, helicopters, gliders, power planes,
p8
aVindoor models, outdoor models, everything,
p9
aVwhich I just thought was a lot of fun,
p10
aVand wondered why most other people didn't share my same enthusiasm with them.
p11
aVAnd then, navy pilot training, and, after college,
p12
aVI got into sailplane flying, power plane flying,
p13
aVand considered the sailplanes as a sort of hobby and fun,
p14
aVbut got tangled up with some great professor types,
p15
aVwho convinced me and everybody else in the field
p16
aVthat this was a good way to get into really deep science.
p17
aa(lp18
VWhile this was all going on, I was in the field of weather modification,
p19
aValthough getting a Ph.D. in aeronautics.
p20
aVThe weather modification subject was getting started,
p21
aVand as a graduate student,
p22
aVI could go around to the various talks that were being given,
p23
aVon a hitchhiker ride to the East Coast,
p24
aVand so on. And everybody would talk to me,
p25
aVbut all the professionals in the field hated each other,
p26
aVand they wouldn't communicate. And as a result,
p27
aVI got the absolutely unique background in that field,
p28
aVand started a company, which did more research
p29
aVin weather modification than anybody,
p30
aVand there are a lot of things that I just can't go into.
p31
aVBut then, 1971 started AeroVironment, with no employees \u2014
p32
aVthen one or two, three,
p33
aVand sort of fumbled along on trying to get interesting projects.
p34
aVWe had AirDynamisis,
p35
aVwho, like I, did not want to work for aerospace companies
p36
aVon some big, many year project,
p37
aVand so we did our small projects, and the company slowly grew.
p38
aa(lp39
VThe thing that is exciting was, in 1976,
p40
aVI suddenly got interested in the human-powered airplane
p41
aVbecause I'd made a made a loan to a friend of 100,000 dollars,
p42
aVor I guaranteed the money at the bank.
p43
aVHe needed them \u2014 he needed the money for starting a company.
p44
aVThe company did not succeed, and he couldn't pay the money back,
p45
aVand I was the guarantor of the note. So, I had a $100,000 debt,
p46
aVand I noticed that the Kramer prize for human-powered flight,
p47
aVwhich had then been around for \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p48
aV17 years at the time, was 50,000 pounds,
p49
aVwhich, at the exchange rate, was just about 100,000 dollars.
p50
aa(lp51
VSo suddenly, I was interested in human-powered flight \u2014
p52
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p53
aVand did not \u2014 the way I approached it, first,
p54
aVthinking about ways to make the planes,
p55
aVwas just like they'd been doing in England, and not succeeding,
p56
aVand I gave it up. I figured, nah, there isn't any simple, easy way.
p57
aVBut then, got off on a vacation trip, and was studying bird flight,
p58
aVjust for the fun of it,
p59
aVand you can watch a bird soaring around in circles,
p60
aVand measure the time, and estimate the bank angle,
p61
aVand immediately, figure out its speed,
p62
aVand the turning radius, and so on,
p63
aVwhich I could do in the car, as we're driving along on a vacation trip \u2014
p64
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p65
aVwith my three sons, young sons, helping me,
p66
aVbut ridiculing the whole thing very much.
p67
aa(lp68
VBut that began thinking about how birds went around,
p69
aVand then how airplanes would, how hang gliders would fly,
p70
aVand then other planes,
p71
aVand the idea of the Gossamer-Condor-type airplane quickly emerged,
p72
aVwas so logical, one should have thought of it in the first place,
p73
aVbut one didn't. And it was just, keep the weight down \u2014
p74
aV70 pounds was all it weighed \u2014 but let the size swell up, like a hang glider,
p75
aVbut three times the span, three times the cord.
p76
aVYou're down to a third of the speed, a third of the power,
p77
aVand a good bicyclist can put out that power, and that worked,
p78
aVand we won the prize a year later.
p79
aa(lp80
VWe didn't \u2014 a lot of flying, a lot of experiments, a lot of things that didn't work,
p81
aVand ones that did work, and the plane kept getting a little better, a little better.
p82
aVGot a good pilot, Brian Allen, to operate it,
p83
aVand finally, succeeded. But unfortunately,
p84
aVabout 65,000 dollars was spent on the project.
p85
aa(lp86
V(Laughter)
p87
aa(lp88
VAnd there was only about 30 to help retire the debt.
p89
aVBut fortunately, Henry Kramer, who put up the prize for \u2014
p90
aVthat was a one-mile flight \u2014 put up a new prize
p91
aVfor flying the English Channel, 21 miles.
p92
aVAnd he thought it would take another 18 years for somebody to win that.
p93
aVWe realized that if you just cleaned up our Gossamer Condor a little bit,
p94
aVthe power to fly would be decreased a little bit,
p95
aVand if you decrease the power required a little,
p96
aVthe pilot can fly a much longer period of time.
p97
aVAnd Brian Allen was able, in a miraculous flight,
p98
aVto get the Gossamer Albatross across the English Channel,
p99
aVand we won the 100,000-pound, 200,000-dollar prize for that.
p100
aVAnd when all expenses were paid, the debt was handled, and everything was fine.
p101
aVIt turned out that giving the planes to the museum
p102
aVwas worth much more than the debt,
p103
aVso for five years, six years, I only had to pay one third income tax.
p104
aVSo, there were good economic reasons for the project, but \u2014
p105
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p106
aa(lp107
Vthat's not, well, the project was done entirely for economic reasons,
p108
aVand we have not been involved in any human-powered flight since then \u2014
p109
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p110
aVbecause the prizes are all over.
p111
aV(Laughter)
p112
aVBut that sure started me thinking about various things,
p113
aVand immediately, we began making a solar-powered plane
p114
aVbecause we felt solar power was going to be so important
p115
aVfor the country and the world,
p116
aVwe didn't want the small funding in the government to be decreased,
p117
aVwhich is what the government was trying to do with it.
p118
aVAnd we thought a solar-powered plane wouldn't really make sense,
p119
aVbut you could do it and it would get a lot of publicity for solar power
p120
aVand maybe help that field.
p121
aVAnd that project continued, did succeed,
p122
aVand we then got into other projects in aviation
p123
aVand mechanical things and ground devices.
p124
aa(lp125
VBut while this was going on,
p126
aVin 1982, I got a prize from the Lindbergh Foundation \u2014
p127
aVtheir annual prize \u2014
p128
aVand I had to prepare a paper on it,
p129
aVwhich collected all my varied thoughts
p130
aVand varied interests over the years.
p131
aVThis was the one chance that I had to focus on what I, really, was after,
p132
aVand what was important. And to my surprise,
p133
aVI realized the importance of environmental issues,
p134
aVwhich Charles Lindbergh devoted the last third of his life to,
p135
aVand preparing that paper did me a lot of good.
p136
aVI thought back about if I was a space traveler,
p137
aVand came and visited Earth every 5,000 years.
p138
aVAnd for a few thousand visits, I would see the same thing every time,
p139
aVthe little differences in the Earth.
p140
aa(lp141
VBut this last time, just coming round, right now,
p142
aVsuddenly, there'd be huge changes in the environment,
p143
aVin the concentration of people,
p144
aVand it was just unbelievable, the amount of \u2014 all the change in it.
p145
aVI wanted to \u2014 well, one of the biggest changes is, 200 years ago,
p146
aVwe began using coal from underground, which has a lot of pollution,
p147
aVand 100 years ago, began getting gasoline from underground,
p148
aVwith a lot of pollution. And gasoline consumption, or production,
p149
aVwill reach its limit in about ten years, and then go down,
p150
aVand we wonder what's going to happen with transportation.
p151
aa(lp152
VI wanted to show the slide \u2014
p153
aVthis slide, I think, is the most important one any of you will see, ever, because \u2014
p154
aV(Laughter)
p155
aV(Applause) \u2014
p156
aVit shows nature versus humans, and goes from 1850 to 2050.
p157
aVAnd so, the year 2000, you see there.
p158
aVAnd this is the weight of all air and land vertebrates.
p159
aVHumans and muskrats and giraffes and birds and so on, are \u2014
p160
aVthe red line goes up. That's the humans and livestock and pets portion.
p161
aVThe green line goes down. That's the wild nature portion.
p162
aVHumans, livestock and pets are, now, 98 percent of the total world's mass
p163
aVof vertebrates on land and air.
p164
aVAnd you don't know what the future will hold,
p165
aVbut it's not going to get a lower percentage.
p166
aVTen thousand years ago, the humans and livestock and pets
p167
aVwere not even one tenth of one percent
p168
aVand wouldn't even have been visible on such a curve.
p169
aVNow they are 98 percent, and it, I think, shows human domination of the Earth.
p170
aa(lp171
VI give a talk to some remarkable high school students each summer,
p172
aVand ask them, after they've asked me questions,
p173
aVand I give them a talk and so on. Then I ask them questions.
p174
aVWhat's the population of the Earth?
p175
aVWhat's the population of the Earth going to be
p176
aVwhen you're the age of your parents?
p177
aVWhich I'd never, really \u2014 they had never, really, thought about
p178
aVbut, now, they think about it.
p179
aVAnd then, what population of the Earth would be an equilibrium
p180
aVthat could continue on, and be for 2050, 2100, 2150?
p181
aVAnd they form little groups, all fighting with each other,
p182
aVand when I leave, two hours later,
p183
aVmost of them are saying about 2 billion people,
p184
aVand they don't have any clue about how to get down to 2 billion,
p185
aVnor do I, but I think they're right and this is a serious problem.
p186
aa(lp187
VRachel Carson was thinking of these, and came out with "Silent Spring," way back.
p188
aV"Solar Manifesto" by Hermann Scheer, in Germany,
p189
aVclaims all energy on Earth can be derived, for every country,
p190
aVfrom solar energy and water, and so on.
p191
aVYou don't need to dig down for these chemicals,
p192
aVand we can do things much more efficiently.
p193
aVLet's have the next slide.
p194
aVSo this just summarizes it. "Over billions of years,
p195
aVon a unique sphere, chance has painted a thin covering of life \u2014
p196
aVcomplex and probable, wonderful and fragile.
p197
aa(lp198
VSuddenly, we humans, a recently arrived species,
p199
aVno longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature,
p200
aVhave grown in population, technology and intelligence
p201
aVto a position of terrible power. We, now, wield the paintbrush."
p202
aVWe're in charge. It's frightening.
p203
aVAnd I do a painting every 20 or 25 years. This is the last one.
p204
aV(Laughter)
p205
aVAnd [it] shows the Earth in a time flag: on the right,
p206
aVin trilobites and dinosaurs and so on;
p207
aVand over the triangle, we now get to civilization and TV
p208
aVand traffic jams and so on.
p209
aVI have no idea of what comes next,
p210
aVso I just used robotic and natural cockroaches as the future,
p211
aVas a little warning.
p212
aVAnd two weeks after this drawing was done,
p213
aVwe actually had our first project contract, at AeroVironment,
p214
aVon robotic cockroaches, which was very frightening to me.
p215
aa(lp216
V(Laughter)
p217
aV(Paper rustling)
p218
aa(lp219
VWell, that'll be all the slides.
p220
aVAs time went on, we stopped our environmental programs.
p221
aVWe focused more on the really serious energy problems
p222
aVof the future, and we produced products for the company.
p223
aVAnd we developed the impact car that General Motors made,
p224
aVthe EV1, out of \u2014
p225
aVand got the Air Resources Board to have the regulations
p226
aVthat stimulated the electric cars, but they've since come apart.
p227
aVAnd we've done a lot of things, small drone airplanes and so on.
p228
aVI have a Helios. We have the first video.
p229
aa(lp230
V(Video) Narrator: With a wingspan of 247 feet, this makes her larger than a Boeing 747.
p231
aa(lp232
V(Music)
p233
aa(lp234
VHer designers' attention to detail and her construction
p235
aVgives Helios' structure the flexibility and strength
p236
aVto deal with the turbulence encountered in the atmosphere.
p237
aVThis enables her to easily ride through the air currents
p238
aVas if she's sliding along on the ocean waves.
p239
aa(lp240
VPaul MacCready: The wings could touch together on top and not break. We think.
p241
aa(lp242
V(Laughter)
p243
aa(lp244
VNarrator: And Helios now begins the process of turning her back to the sun,
p245
aVto maximize the power from her solar array.
p246
aa(lp247
V(Music)
p248
aVAs the sky gets darker, and the outside air temperatures drop
p249
aVbelow minus 100 degrees Fahrenheit,
p250
aVthe most environmentally hostile segment of Helios's journey
p251
aVhas gone by without notice,
p252
aVexcept for being recorded by specially designed data acquisition systems
p253
aVand their associated sensors.
p254
aVApproaching a peak radar altitude of 96,863 feet,
p255
aVat 4:12 p.m., Helios is standing on top of 98 percent of the Earth's atmosphere.
p256
aVThis is more than 10,000 feet higher
p257
aVthan the previous world's altitude record held by the SR-71 Blackbird.
p258
aa(lp259
V(Applause)
p260
aa(lp261
VPM: That plane has many purposes, but it's aimed for communications,
p262
aVand it can fly so slowly that it'll just stay up at 65,000 feet.
p263
aVEventually, it will be able to have to stay up day, night, day, night,
p264
aVfor six months at a time, acting like the synchronous satellite,
p265
aVbut only ten miles above the Earth.
p266
aVLet's have the next video. This shows the other end of the spectrum.
p267
aa(lp268
V(Video) Narrator: A tiny airplane, the AV Pointer serves for surveillance.
p269
aVIn effect a pair of roving eyeglasses,
p270
aVa cutting-edge example of where miniaturization can lead
p271
aVif the operator is remote from the vehicle.
p272
aVIt is convenient to carry, assemble, and launch by hand.
p273
aVBattery-powered, it is silent and rarely noticed.
p274
aVIt sends high-resolution video pictures back to the operator.
p275
aVWith on-board GPS, it can navigate autonomously,
p276
aVand it is rugged enough to self-land without damage.
p277
aa(lp278
VPM: Okay, and let's have the next.
p279
aa(lp280
V(Applause)
p281
aa(lp282
VThat plane is widely used by the military, now, in all their operations.
p283
aVLet's have the next video.
p284
aa(lp285
V(Video) (Music)
p286
aa(lp287
VAlan Alda: He's got it, he's got it, he's got it on his head.
p288
aa(lp289
V(Music)
p290
aa(lp291
VWe're going to end our visit with Paul MacCready's flying circus
p292
aVby meeting his son, Tyler, who, with his two brothers,
p293
aVhelped build the Gossamer Condor, 25 years ago.
p294
aa(lp295
VTyler MacCready: You can chase it, like this, for hours.
p296
aa(lp297
VAA: When they got bored with their father's project,
p298
aVthey invented an extraordinary little plane of their own.
p299
aa(lp300
VTM: And I can control it by putting the lift on one side of the wing, or on the other.
p301
aa(lp302
VAA: They called it their Walkalong Glider.
p303
aa(lp304
V(Music)
p305
aa(lp306
VI've never seen anything like that.
p307
aVHow old were you when you invented that?
p308
aa(lp309
VTM: Oh, 10, 11. (AA: Oh my God.)
p310
aa(lp311
VTM: 12, something like that. (AA: That's amazing.)
p312
aa(lp313
VPM: And Tyler's here to show you the Walkalong.
p314
aa(lp315
V(Applause)
p316
aa(lp317
VTM: All right. You all got a couple of these in your gift bags,
p318
aVand one of the first things,
p319
aVthe production version seemed to dive a little bit,
p320
aVand so I would just suggest you bend the wing tips up a little bit
p321
aVbefore you try flying it.
p322
aVI'll give you a demonstration of how it works.
p323
aVThe idea is that it soars on the lift over your body, like a seagull soaring on a cliff.
p324
aVAs the wind comes up, it has to go over the cliff, so
p325
aVas you walk through the air, it goes around your body, some has to go over you.
p326
aVAnd so you just keep the glider positioned in that up current.
p327
aVThe launch is the difficult part: you've got to hold it high up, over your head,
p328
aVand you start walking forward, and just let go of it, and you can control it like that.
p329
aa(lp330
V(Laughter)
p331
aa(lp332
VAnd then also, like it said in the video,
p333
aVyou can turn it left or right
p334
aVjust by putting the lift under one wing or another.
p335
aVSo I can do it \u2014 oops, that was going to be a right turn.
p336
aa(lp337
V(Laughter)
p338
aa(lp339
VOkay, this one will be a left turn.
p340
aVHere, but \u2014
p341
aV(Applause) \u2014
p342
aVanyway.
p343
aV(Applause)
p344
aVAnd that's it, so you can just control it, wherever you want,
p345
aVand it's just hours of fun. And these are no longer in production,
p346
aVso you have real collector's items.
p347
aa(lp348
V(Laughter)
p349
aa(lp350
VAnd this, we just wanted to show you \u2014
p351
aVif we can get the video running on this, yeah \u2014
p352
aVjust an example of a little video surveillance.
p353
aa(lp354
V(Laughter)
p355
aa(lp356
VThis was flying around in the party last night, and \u2014
p357
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p358
aVyou can see how it just can fly around,
p359
aVand you can spy on anybody you want.
p360
aa(lp361
V(Laughter)
p362
aa(lp363
VAnd that's it. I was going to bring an airplane,
p364
aVbut I was worried about hitting people in here,
p365
aVso I thought this would be a little bit more gentle.
p366
aVAnd that's it, yeah, just a few inventions.
p367
aV(Applause)
p368
aVAll right.
