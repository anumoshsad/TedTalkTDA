VPeople have been using media to talk about sex for a long time.
p4
aVLove letters, phone sex, racy Polaroids.
p5
aVThere's even a story of a girl who eloped with a man that she met over the telegraph
p6
aVin 1886.
p7
aVToday we have sexting, and I am a sexting expert.
p8
aVNot an expert sexter.
p9
aVThough, I do know what this means \u2014 I think you do too.
p10
aa(lp11
V[it's a penis]
p12
aa(lp13
V(Laughter)
p14
aa(lp15
VI have been studying sexting since the media attention to it began in 2008.
p16
aVI wrote a book on the moral panic about sexting.
p17
aVAnd here's what I found:
p18
aVmost people are worrying about the wrong thing.
p19
aVThey're trying to just prevent sexting from happening entirely.
p20
aVBut let me ask you this:
p21
aVAs long as it's completely consensual, what's the problem with sexting?
p22
aVPeople are into all sorts of things that you may not be into,
p23
aVlike blue cheese or cilantro.
p24
aa(lp25
V(Laughter)
p26
aa(lp27
VSexting is certainly risky, like anything that's fun,
p28
aVbut as long as you're not sending an image to someone who doesn't want to receive it,
p29
aVthere's no harm.
p30
aVWhat I do think is a serious problem
p31
aVis when people share private images of others
p32
aVwithout their permission.
p33
aVAnd instead of worrying about sexting,
p34
aVwhat I think we need to do is think a lot more about digital privacy.
p35
aa(lp36
VThe key is consent.
p37
aVRight now most people are thinking about sexting
p38
aVwithout really thinking about consent at all.
p39
aVDid you know that we currently criminalize teen sexting?
p40
aVIt can be a crime because it counts as child pornography,
p41
aVif there's an image of someone under 18,
p42
aVand it doesn't even matter
p43
aVif they took that image of themselves and shared it willingly.
p44
aVSo we end up with this bizarre legal situation
p45
aVwhere two 17-year-olds can legally have sex in most US states
p46
aVbut they can't photograph it.
p47
aVSome states have also tried passing sexting misdemeanor laws
p48
aVbut these laws repeat the same problem
p49
aVbecause they still make consensual sexting illegal.
p50
aVIt doesn't make sense
p51
aVto try to ban all sexting to try to address privacy violations.
p52
aVThis is kind of like saying,
p53
aVlet's solve the problem of date rape by just making dating completely illegal.
p54
aVMost teens don't get arrested for sexting, but can you guess who does?
p55
aVIt's often teens who are disliked by their partner's parents.
p56
aVAnd this can be because of class bias, racism or homophobia.
p57
aVMost prosecutors are, of course, smart enough
p58
aVnot to use child pornography charges against teenagers, but some do.
p59
aa(lp60
VAccording to researchers at the University of New Hampshire
p61
aVseven percent of all child pornography possession arrests are teens,
p62
aVsexting consensually with other teens.
p63
aVChild pornography is a serious crime,
p64
aVbut it's just not the same thing as teen sexting.
p65
aVParents and educators are also responding to sexting
p66
aVwithout really thinking too much about consent.
p67
aVTheir message to teens is often: just don't do it.
p68
aa(lp69
VAnd I totally get it \u2014 there are serious legal risks
p70
aVand of course, that potential for privacy violations.
p71
aVAnd when you were a teen,
p72
aVI'm sure you did exactly as you were told, right?
p73
aa(lp74
VYou're probably thinking, my kid would never sext.
p75
aVAnd that's true, your little angel may not be sexting
p76
aVbecause only 33 percent
p77
aVof 16- and 17-year-olds are sexting.
p78
aVBut, sorry, by the time they're older, odds are they will be sexting.
p79
aVEvery study I've seen puts the rate above 50 percent for 18- to 24-year-olds.
p80
aVAnd most of the time, nothing goes wrong.
p81
aVPeople ask me all the time things like, isn't sexting just so dangerous, though?
p82
aVIt's like you wouldn't leave your wallet on a park bench
p83
aVand you expect it's going to get stolen if you do that, right?
p84
aVHere's how I think about it:
p85
aVsexting is like leaving your wallet at your boyfriend's house.
p86
aVIf you come back the next day
p87
aVand all the money is just gone,
p88
aVyou really need to dump that guy.
p89
aV(Laughter)
p90
aVSo instead of criminalizing sexting
p91
aVto try to prevent these privacy violations,
p92
aVinstead we need to make consent central
p93
aVto how we think about the circulation of our private information.
p94
aa(lp95
VEvery new media technology raises privacy concerns.
p96
aVIn fact, in the US the very first major debates about privacy
p97
aVwere in response to technologies that were relatively new at the time.
p98
aVIn the late 1800s, people were worried about cameras,
p99
aVwhich were just suddenly more portable than ever before,
p100
aVand newspaper gossip columns.
p101
aVThey were worried that the camera would capture information about them,
p102
aVtake it out of context and widely disseminate it.
p103
aVDoes this sound familiar?
p104
aVIt's exactly what we're worrying about now with social media and drone cameras,
p105
aVand, of course, sexting.
p106
aVAnd these fears about technology,
p107
aVthey make sense
p108
aVbecause technologies can amplify and bring out
p109
aVour worst qualities and behaviors.
p110
aVBut there are solutions.
p111
aVAnd we've been here before with a dangerous new technology.
p112
aa(lp113
VIn 1908, Ford introduced the Model T car.
p114
aVTraffic fatality rates were rising.
p115
aVIt was a serious problem \u2014 it looks so safe, right?
p116
aVOur first response was to try to change drivers' behavior,
p117
aVso we developed speed limits and enforced them through fines.
p118
aVBut over the following decades,
p119
aVwe started to realize the technology of the car itself is not just neutral.
p120
aVWe could design the car to make it safer.
p121
aVSo in the 1920s, we got shatter-resistant windshields.
p122
aVIn the 1950s, seat belts.
p123
aVAnd in the 1990s, airbags.
p124
aVAll three of these areas:
p125
aVlaws, individuals and industry came together over time
p126
aVto help solve the problem that a new technology causes.
p127
aVAnd we can do the same thing with digital privacy.
p128
aVOf course, it comes back to consent.
p129
aVHere's the idea.
p130
aVBefore anyone can distribute your private information,
p131
aVthey should have to get your permission.
p132
aVThis idea of affirmative consent comes from anti-rape activists
p133
aVwho tell us that we need consent for every sexual act.
p134
aVAnd we have really high standards for consent in a lot of other areas.
p135
aa(lp136
VThink about having surgery.
p137
aVYour doctor has to make sure
p138
aVthat you are meaningfully and knowingly consenting to that medical procedure.
p139
aVThis is not the type of consent like with an iTunes Terms of Service
p140
aVwhere you just scroll to the bottom and you're like, agree, agree, whatever.
p141
aa(lp142
V(Laughter)
p143
aa(lp144
VIf we think more about consent, we can have better privacy laws.
p145
aVRight now, we just don't have that many protections.
p146
aVIf your ex-husband or your ex-wife is a terrible person,
p147
aVthey can take your nude photos and upload them to a porn site.
p148
aVIt can be really hard to get those images taken down.
p149
aVAnd in a lot of states,
p150
aVyou're actually better off if you took the images of yourself
p151
aVbecause then you can file a copyright claim.
p152
aa(lp153
V(Laughter)
p154
aa(lp155
VRight now, if someone violates your privacy,
p156
aVwhether that's an individual or a company or the NSA,
p157
aVyou can try filing a lawsuit,
p158
aVthough you may not be successful
p159
aVbecause many courts assume that digital privacy is just impossible.
p160
aVSo they're not willing to punish anyone for violating it.
p161
aVI still hear people asking me all the time,
p162
aVisn't a digital image somehow blurring the line between public and private
p163
aVbecause it's digital, right?
p164
aVNo! No!
p165
aVEverything digital is not just automatically public.
p166
aVThat doesn't make any sense.
p167
aa(lp168
VAs NYU legal scholar Helen Nissenbaum tells us,
p169
aVwe have laws and policies and norms
p170
aVthat protect all kinds of information that's private,
p171
aVand it doesn't make a difference if it's digital or not.
p172
aVAll of your health records are digitized
p173
aVbut your doctor can't just share them with anyone.
p174
aVAll of your financial information is held in digital databases,
p175
aVbut your credit card company can't just post your purchase history online.
p176
aVBetter laws could help address privacy violations after they happen,
p177
aVbut one of the easiest things we can all do is make personal changes
p178
aVto help protect each other's privacy.
p179
aVWe're always told that privacy
p180
aVis our own, sole, individual responsibility.
p181
aVWe're told, constantly monitor and update your privacy settings.
p182
aVWe're told, never share anything you wouldn't want the entire world to see.
p183
aVThis doesn't make sense.
p184
aVDigital media are social environments
p185
aVand we share things with people we trust all day, every day.
p186
aa(lp187
VAs Princeton researcher Janet Vertesi argues,
p188
aVour data and our privacy, they're not just personal,
p189
aVthey're actually interpersonal.
p190
aVAnd so one thing you can do that's really easy
p191
aVis just start asking for permission before you share anyone else's information.
p192
aVIf you want to post a photo of someone online, ask for permission.
p193
aVIf you want to forward an email thread,
p194
aVask for permission.
p195
aVAnd if you want to share someone's nude selfie,
p196
aVobviously, ask for permission.
p197
aa(lp198
VThese individual changes can really help us protect each other's privacy,
p199
aVbut we need technology companies on board as well.
p200
aVThese companies have very little incentive to help protect our privacy
p201
aVbecause their business models depend on us sharing everything
p202
aVwith as many people as possible.
p203
aVRight now, if I send you an image,
p204
aVyou can forward that to anyone that you want.
p205
aVBut what if I got to decide if that image was forwardable or not?
p206
aVThis would tell you, you don't have my permission to send this image out.
p207
aVWe do this kind of thing all the time to protect copyright.
p208
aVIf you buy an e-book, you can't just send it out to as many people as you want.
p209
aVSo why not try this with mobile phones?
p210
aVWhat you can do is we can demand that tech companies add these protections
p211
aVto our devices and our platforms as the default.
p212
aVAfter all, you can choose the color of your car,
p213
aVbut the airbags are always standard.
p214
aa(lp215
VIf we don't think more about digital privacy and consent,
p216
aVthere can be serious consequences.
p217
aVThere was a teenager from Ohio \u2014
p218
aVlet's call her Jennifer, for the sake of her privacy.
p219
aVShe shared nude photos of herself with her high school boyfriend,
p220
aVthinking she could trust him.
p221
aVUnfortunately, he betrayed her
p222
aVand sent her photos around the entire school.
p223
aVJennifer was embarrassed and humiliated,
p224
aVbut instead of being compassionate, her classmates harassed her.
p225
aVThey called her a slut and a whore
p226
aVand they made her life miserable.
p227
aVJennifer started missing school and her grades dropped.
p228
aVUltimately, Jennifer decided to end her own life.
p229
aa(lp230
VJennifer did nothing wrong.
p231
aVAll she did was share a nude photo
p232
aVwith someone she thought that she could trust.
p233
aVAnd yet our laws tell her
p234
aVthat she committed a horrible crime equivalent to child pornography.
p235
aVOur gender norms tell her
p236
aVthat by producing this nude image of herself,
p237
aVshe somehow did the most horrible, shameful thing.
p238
aVAnd when we assume that privacy is impossible in digital media,
p239
aVwe completely write off and excuse her boyfriend's bad, bad behavior.
p240
aVPeople are still saying all the time to victims of privacy violations,
p241
aV"What were you thinking?
p242
aVYou should have never sent that image."
p243
aa(lp244
VIf you're trying to figure out what to say instead, try this.
p245
aVImagine you've run into your friend who broke their leg skiing.
p246
aVThey took a risk to do something fun, and it didn't end well.
p247
aVBut you're probably not going to be the jerk who says,
p248
aV"Well, I guess you shouldn't have gone skiing then."
p249
aVIf we think more about consent,
p250
aVwe can see that victims of privacy violations
p251
aVdeserve our compassion,
p252
aVnot criminalization, shaming, harassment or punishment.
p253
aVWe can support victims, and we can prevent some privacy violations
p254
aVby making these legal, individual and technological changes.
p255
aVBecause the problem is not sexting, the issue is digital privacy.
p256
aVAnd one solution is consent.
p257
aa(lp258
VSo the next time a victim of a privacy violation comes up to you,
p259
aVinstead of blaming them, let's do this instead:
p260
aVlet's shift our ideas about digital privacy,
p261
aVand let's respond with compassion.
p262
aa(lp263
VThank you.
