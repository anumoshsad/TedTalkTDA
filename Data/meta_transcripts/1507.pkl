VSomething happened in the early morning hours
p4
aVof May 2nd, 2000, that had a profound effect
p5
aVon the way our society operates.
p6
aVIronically, hardly anyone noticed at the time.
p7
aVThe change was silent, imperceptible,
p8
aVunless you knew exactly what to look for.
p9
aVOn that morning, U.S. President Bill Clinton
p10
aVordered that a special switch be thrown
p11
aVin the orbiting satellites of the Global Positioning System.
p12
aVInstantaneously, every civilian GPS receiver
p13
aVaround the globe went from errors the size of a football field
p14
aVto errors the size of a small room.
p15
aa(lp16
VIt's hard to overstate the effect that this change
p17
aVin accuracy has had on us.
p18
aVBefore this switch was thrown, we didn't have
p19
aVin-car navigation systems giving turn-by-turn
p20
aVdirections, because back then, GPS couldn't tell you
p21
aVwhat block you were on, let alone what street.
p22
aa(lp23
VFor geolocation, accuracy matters,
p24
aVand things have only improved over the last 10 years.
p25
aVWith more base stations, more ground stations,
p26
aVbetter receivers and better algorithms,
p27
aVGPS can now not only tell you what street you are on,
p28
aVbut what part of the street.
p29
aa(lp30
VThis level of accuracy
p31
aVhas unleashed a firestorm of innovation.
p32
aVIn fact, many of you navigated here today
p33
aVwith the help of your TomTom or your smartphone.
p34
aVPaper maps are becoming obsolete.
p35
aa(lp36
VBut we now stand on the verge of another revolution
p37
aVin geolocation accuracy.
p38
aVWhat if I told you that the two-meter positioning
p39
aVthat our current cell phones and our TomToms give us
p40
aVis pathetic compared to what we could be getting?
p41
aVFor some time now, it's been known that if you pay attention
p42
aVto the carrier phase of the GPS signal,
p43
aVand if you have an Internet connection,
p44
aVthen you can go from meter level to centimeter level,
p45
aVeven millimeter-level positioning.
p46
aa(lp47
VSo why don't we have this capability on our phones?
p48
aVOnly, I believe, for a lack of imagination.
p49
aVManufacturers haven't built this carrier phase technique
p50
aVinto their cheap GPS chips
p51
aVbecause they're not sure what the general public would do
p52
aVwith geolocation so accurate that you could pinpoint
p53
aVthe wrinkles in the palm of your hand.
p54
aVBut you and I and other innovators,
p55
aVwe can see the potential in this next leap in accuracy.
p56
aVImagine, for example, an augmented reality app
p57
aVthat overlays a virtual world to millimeter-level precision
p58
aVon top of the physical world.
p59
aVI could build for you a structure up here in 3D,
p60
aVmillimeter accurate, that only you could see,
p61
aVor my friends at home.
p62
aa(lp63
VSo this level of positioning, this is what we're looking for,
p64
aVand I believe that, within the next few years, I predict,
p65
aVthat this kind of hyper-precise, carrier phase-based positioning
p66
aVwill become cheap and ubiquitous,
p67
aVand the consequences will be fantastic.
p68
aa(lp69
VThe Holy Grail, of course, is the GPS dot.
p70
aVDo you remember the movie "The Da Vinci Code?"
p71
aVHere's Professor Langdon examining a GPS dot,
p72
aVwhich his accomplice tells him is a tracking device
p73
aVaccurate within two feet anywhere on the globe,
p74
aVbut we know that in the world of nonfiction,
p75
aVthe GPS dot is impossible, right?
p76
aVFor one thing, GPS doesn't work indoors,
p77
aVand for another, they don't make devices quite this small,
p78
aVespecially when those devices have to relay
p79
aVtheir measurements back over a network.
p80
aa(lp81
VWell, these objections were perfectly reasonable
p82
aVa few years ago, but things have changed.
p83
aVThere's been a strong trend toward miniaturization,
p84
aVbetter sensitivity, so much so that, a few years ago,
p85
aVa GPS tracking device looked like this clunky box
p86
aVto the left of the keys.
p87
aVCompare that with the device released just months ago
p88
aVthat's now packaged into something the size of a key fob,
p89
aVand if you take a look at the state of the art
p90
aVfor a complete GPS receiver, which is only a centimeter
p91
aVon a side and more sensitive than ever,
p92
aVyou realize that the GPS dot will soon move
p93
aVfrom fiction to nonfiction.
p94
aa(lp95
VImagine what we could do with a world full of GPS dots.
p96
aVIt's not just that you'll never lose your wallet or your keys
p97
aVanymore, or your child when you're at Disneyland.
p98
aVYou'll buy GPS dots in bulk, and you'll stick them on
p99
aVeverything you own worth more than a few tens of dollars.
p100
aa(lp101
VI couldn't find my shoes one recent morning,
p102
aVand, as usual, had to ask my wife if she had seen them.
p103
aVBut I shouldn't have to bother my wife with that kind of triviality.
p104
aVI should be able to ask my house where my shoes are.
p105
aV(Laughter)
p106
aa(lp107
VThose of you who have made the switch to Gmail,
p108
aVremember how refreshing it was to go from
p109
aVorganizing all of your email to simply searching it.
p110
aVThe GPS dot will do the same for our possessions.
p111
aa(lp112
VNow, of course, there is a flip side to the GPS dot.
p113
aVI was in my office some months back
p114
aVand got a telephone call.
p115
aVThe woman on the other end of the line, we'll call her Carol,
p116
aVwas panicked.
p117
aVApparently, an ex-boyfriend of Carol's from California
p118
aVhad found her in Texas and was following her around.
p119
aVSo you might ask at this point why she's calling you.
p120
aVWell, so did I.
p121
aVBut it turned out there was a technical twist to Carol's case.
p122
aVEvery time her ex-boyfriend would show up,
p123
aVat the most improbable times and the most improbable locations,
p124
aVhe was carrying an open laptop,
p125
aVand over time Carol realized that he had planted
p126
aVa GPS tracking device on her car,
p127
aVso she was calling me for help to disable it.
p128
aa(lp129
V"Well, you should go to a good mechanic
p130
aVand have him look at your car," I said.
p131
aa(lp132
V"I already have," she told me.
p133
aV"He didn't see anything obvious,
p134
aVand he said he'd have to take the car apart piece by piece."
p135
aa(lp136
V"Well then, you'd better go to the police," I said.
p137
aa(lp138
V"I already have," she replied.
p139
aV"They're not sure this rises to the level of harassment,
p140
aVand they're not set up technically to find the device."
p141
aa(lp142
V"Okay, what about the FBI?"
p143
aa(lp144
V"I've talked to them too, and same story."
p145
aa(lp146
VWe then talked about her coming to my lab
p147
aVand us performing a radio sweep of her car,
p148
aVbut I wasn't even sure that would work,
p149
aVgiven that some of these devices are configured
p150
aVto only transmit when they're inside safe zones
p151
aVor when the car is moving.
p152
aa(lp153
VSo, there we were.
p154
aVCarol isn't the first, and certainly won't be the last,
p155
aVto find herself in this kind of fearsome environment,
p156
aVworrisome situation caused by GPS tracking.
p157
aa(lp158
VIn fact, as I looked into her case,
p159
aVI discovered to my surprise that it's not clearly illegal
p160
aVfor you or me to put a tracking device on someone else's car.
p161
aVThe Supreme Court ruled last month that a policeman
p162
aVhas to get a warrant if he wants to do prolonged tracking,
p163
aVbut the law isn't clear about civilians doing this to one another,
p164
aVso it's not just Big Brother we have to worry about,
p165
aVbut Big Neighbor. (Laughter)
p166
aa(lp167
VThere is one alternative that Carol could have taken,
p168
aVvery effective. It's called the Wave Bubble.
p169
aVIt's an open-source GPS jammer,
p170
aVdeveloped by Limor Fried,
p171
aVa graduate student at MIT, and Limor calls it
p172
aV"a tool for reclaiming our personal space."
p173
aVWith a flip of the switch you create a bubble around you
p174
aVwithin which GPS signals can't reside.
p175
aVThey get drowned out by the bubble.
p176
aVAnd Limor designed this, in part, because, like Carol,
p177
aVshe felt threatened by GPS tracking.
p178
aVThen she posted her design to the web,
p179
aVand if you don't have time to build your own,
p180
aVyou can buy one.
p181
aVChinese manufacturers now sell thousands
p182
aVof nearly identical devices on the Internet.
p183
aa(lp184
VSo you might be thinking, the Wave Bubble sounds great.
p185
aVI should have one. Might come in handy if somebody ever puts a tracking device on my car.
p186
aVBut you should be aware that its use is very much illegal
p187
aVin the United States.
p188
aVAnd why is that?
p189
aVWell, because it's not a bubble at all.
p190
aVIts jamming signals don't stop at the edge
p191
aVof your personal space or at the edge of your car.
p192
aVThey go on to jam innocent GPS receivers for miles around you. (Laughter)
p193
aa(lp194
VNow, if you're Carol or Limor,
p195
aVor someone who feels threatened by GPS tracking,
p196
aVit might not feel wrong to turn on a Wave Bubble,
p197
aVbut in fact, the results can be disastrous.
p198
aVImagine, for example, you're the captain of a cruise ship
p199
aVtrying to make your way through a thick fog
p200
aVand some passenger in the back turns on a Wave Bubble.
p201
aVAll of a sudden your GPS readout goes blank,
p202
aVand now it's just you and the fog
p203
aVand whatever you can pull off the radar system
p204
aVif you remember how to work it.
p205
aVThey \u2014 in fact, they don't update or upkeep lighthouses
p206
aVanymore, and LORAN, the only backup to GPS,
p207
aVwas discontinued last year.
p208
aa(lp209
VOur modern society has a special relationship with GPS.
p210
aVWe're almost blindly reliant on it.
p211
aVIt's built deeply into our systems and infrastructure.
p212
aVSome call it "the invisible utility."
p213
aVSo, turning on a Wave Bubble might not just cause inconvenience.
p214
aVIt might be deadly.
p215
aa(lp216
VBut as it turns out, for purposes of protecting your privacy
p217
aVat the expense of general GPS reliability,
p218
aVthere's something even more potent
p219
aVand more subversive than a Wave Bubble,
p220
aVand that is a GPS spoofer.
p221
aa(lp222
VThe idea behind the GPS spoofer is simple.
p223
aVInstead of jamming the GPS signals, you fake them.
p224
aVYou imitate them, and if you do it right, the device
p225
aVyou're attacking doesn't even know it's being spoofed.
p226
aa(lp227
VSo let me show you how this works.
p228
aVIn any GPS receiver, there's a peak inside
p229
aVthat corresponds to the authentic signals.
p230
aVThese three red dots represent the tracking points
p231
aVthat try to keep themselves centered on that peak.
p232
aVBut if you send in a fake GPS signal,
p233
aVanother peak pops up, and if you can get these two peaks
p234
aVperfectly aligned, the tracking points can't tell the difference,
p235
aVand they get hijacked by the stronger counterfeit signal,
p236
aVwith the authentic peak getting forced off.
p237
aVAt this point, the game is over.
p238
aVThe fake signals now completely control this GPS receiver.
p239
aa(lp240
VSo is this really possible?
p241
aVCan someone really manipulate
p242
aVthe timing and positioning of a GPS receiver
p243
aVjust like that, with a spoofer?
p244
aVWell, the short answer is yes.
p245
aVThe key is that civil GPS signals
p246
aVare completely open.
p247
aVThey have no encryption. They have no authentication.
p248
aVThey're wide open, vulnerable to a kind of spoofing attack.
p249
aVEven so, up until very recently,
p250
aVnobody worried about GPS spoofers.
p251
aVPeople figured that it would be too complex
p252
aVor too expensive for some hacker to build one.
p253
aa(lp254
VBut I, and a friend of mine from graduate school,
p255
aVwe didn't see it that way.
p256
aVWe knew it wasn't going to be so hard,
p257
aVand we wanted to be the first to build one
p258
aVso we could get out in front of the problem
p259
aVand help protect against GPS spoofing.
p260
aVI remember vividly the week it all came together.
p261
aVWe built it at my home, which means that
p262
aVI got a little extra help from my three-year-old son Ramon.
p263
aVHere's Ramon \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p264
aVlooking for a little attention from Dad that week.
p265
aVAt first, the spoofer was just a jumble of cables
p266
aVand computers, though we eventually got it packaged
p267
aVinto a small box.
p268
aa(lp269
VNow, the Dr. Frankenstein moment,
p270
aVwhen the spoofer finally came alive
p271
aVand I glimpsed its awful potential,
p272
aVcame late one night when I tested the spoofer
p273
aVagainst my iPhone.
p274
aVLet me show you some actual footage from that
p275
aVvery first experiment.
p276
aVI had come to completely trust this little blue dot
p277
aVand its reassuring blue halo.
p278
aVThey seemed to speak to me.
p279
aVThey'd say, "Here you are. Here you are." (Laughter)
p280
aVAnd "you can trust us."
p281
aVSo something felt very wrong about the world.
p282
aVIt was a sense, almost, of betrayal,
p283
aVwhen this little blue dot started at my house,
p284
aVand went running off toward the north
p285
aVleaving me behind. I wasn't moving.
p286
aVWhat I then saw in this little moving blue dot
p287
aVwas the potential for chaos.
p288
aVI saw airplanes and ships veering off course, with the captain
p289
aVlearning only too late that something was wrong.
p290
aVI saw the GPS-derived timing
p291
aVof the New York Stock Exchange
p292
aVbeing manipulated by hackers.
p293
aVYou can scarcely imagine the kind of havoc
p294
aVyou could cause if you knew what you were doing
p295
aVwith a GPS spoofer.
p296
aa(lp297
VThere is, though, one redeeming feature
p298
aVof the GPS spoofer.
p299
aVIt's the ultimate weapon against an invasion of GPS dots.
p300
aVImagine, for example, you're being tracked.
p301
aVWell, you can play the tracker for a fool,
p302
aVpretending to be at work when you're really on vacation.
p303
aVOr, if you're Carol, you could lure your ex-boyfriend
p304
aVinto some empty parking lot
p305
aVwhere the police are waiting for him.
p306
aa(lp307
VSo I'm fascinated by this conflict, a looming conflict,
p308
aVbetween privacy on the one hand
p309
aVand the need for a clean radio spectrum on the other.
p310
aVWe simply cannot tolerate GPS jammers and spoofers,
p311
aVand yet, given the lack of effective legal means
p312
aVfor protecting our privacy from the GPS dot,
p313
aVcan you really blame people for wanting to turn them on,
p314
aVfor wanting to use them?
p315
aa(lp316
VI hold out hope that we'll be able to reconcile
p317
aVthis conflict with some sort of,
p318
aVsome yet uninvented technology.
p319
aVBut meanwhile, grab some popcorn,
p320
aVbecause things are going to get interesting.
p321
aa(lp322
VWithin the next few years,
p323
aVmany of you will be the proud owner of a GPS dot.
p324
aVMaybe you'll have a whole bag full of them.
p325
aVYou'll never lose track of your things again.
p326
aVThe GPS dot will fundamentally reorder your life.
p327
aVBut will you be able to resist the temptation
p328
aVto track your fellow man?
p329
aVOr will you be able to resist the temptation
p330
aVto turn on a GPS spoofer or a Wave Bubble
p331
aVto protect your own privacy?
p332
aa(lp333
VSo, as usual, what we see just beyond the horizon
p334
aVis full of promise and peril.
p335
aVIt'll be fascinating to see how this all turns out.
