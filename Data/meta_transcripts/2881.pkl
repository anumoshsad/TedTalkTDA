VWhat stands between Africa's current prostrate condition
p4
aVand a future of prosperity and abundance for its long-suffering populations?
p5
aVOne word:
p6
aVknowledge.
p7
aVIf Africa is to become a continent that offers the best life for humans,
p8
aVit must become a knowledge society
p9
aVimmediately.
p10
aVThis is what I have called "Africa's knowledge imperative."
p11
aa(lp12
VOur universities must reduce emphasis on producing manpower
p13
aVfor running our civil society,
p14
aVour economy
p15
aVand our political institutions.
p16
aVThey should be dedicated mainly to knowledge production.
p17
aVWhat sense is there in producing civil engineers
p18
aVwho are not supported by soil scientists and geologists,
p19
aVwho make it their business to create knowledge about our soil
p20
aVand our rocks?
p21
aVWhat use is there in producing lawyers
p22
aVwithout juries who produce knowledge
p23
aVof the underlying philosophical foundations of the legal system?
p24
aVWe must seek knowledge.
p25
aVWe must approach the matter of knowledge
p26
aVwith a maniacal commitment,
p27
aVwithout let or hindrance.
p28
aa(lp29
VThough we must seek knowledge to solve problems we know of,
p30
aVwe must also seek knowledge
p31
aVwhen there is no problem in view \u2014
p32
aVespecially when there is no problem in view.
p33
aVWe must seek to know as much of what there is to know of all things,
p34
aVlimited only by the insufficiency of our human nature,
p35
aVand not only when the need arises.
p36
aVThose who do not seek knowledge when it is not needed
p37
aVwill not have it when they must have it.
p38
aa(lp39
VThe biggest crisis in Africa today is the crisis of knowledge:
p40
aVhow to produce it,
p41
aVhow to manage it,
p42
aVand how to deploy it effectively.
p43
aVFor instance, Africa does not have a water crisis.
p44
aVIt has a knowledge crisis regarding its water,
p45
aVwhere and what types it is,
p46
aVhow it can be tapped and made available where and when needed to all and sundry.
p47
aVHow does a continent that is home
p48
aVto some of the largest bodies of water in the world \u2014
p49
aVthe Nile,
p50
aVthe Niger,
p51
aVthe Congo,
p52
aVthe Zambezi
p53
aVand the Orange Rivers \u2014
p54
aVbe said to have a water crisis,
p55
aVincluding in countries
p56
aVwhere those rivers are?
p57
aVAnd that is only surface water.
p58
aa(lp59
VWhile we wrongly dissipate our energies fighting the wrong crises,
p60
aVall those who invest in knowledge about us
p61
aVare busy figuring out how to pipe water from Libya's aquifers
p62
aVto quench Europe's thirst.
p63
aVSuch is our knowledge of our water resources
p64
aVthat many of our countries have given up
p65
aVon making potable water a routine presence
p66
aVin the lives of Africans,
p67
aVrich or poor,
p68
aVhigh and low,
p69
aVrural and urban.
p70
aVWe eagerly accept what the merchants of misery
p71
aVand the global African Studies safari professoriat
p72
aVand their aid-addled,
p73
aVautonomy-fearing African minions
p74
aVin government, universities and civil society
p75
aVtell us regarding how nature has been to stinting towards Africa
p76
aVwhen it comes to the distribution of water resources in the world.
p77
aVWe are content to run our cities and rural dwellings alike
p78
aVon boreholes.
p79
aVHow does one run metropolises on boreholes and wells?
p80
aa(lp81
VDoes Africa have a food crisis?
p82
aVAgain, the answer is no.
p83
aVIt is yet another knowledge crisis regarding Africa's agricultural resources,
p84
aVwhat and where they are,
p85
aVand how they can be best managed to make Africans live more lives
p86
aVthat are worth living.
p87
aVOtherwise, how does one explain the fact
p88
aVthat geography puts the source of the River Nile in Ethiopia,
p89
aVand its people cannot have water for their lives?
p90
aVAnd the same geography puts California in the desert,
p91
aVbut it is a breadbasket.
p92
aa(lp93
VThe difference, obviously, is not geography.
p94
aVIt is knowledge.
p95
aVColorado's aquifers
p96
aVgrow California's pistachios.
p97
aVWhy can't Libya's aquifers
p98
aVgrow sorghum in northern Nigeria?
p99
aVWhy does Nigeria not aspire
p100
aVto feed the world,
p101
aVnot just itself?
p102
aVIf Africa's land is so poor, as we are often told,
p103
aVwhy are outsiders,
p104
aVfrom the United Arab Emirates all the way to South Korea,
p105
aVbuying up vast acreages of our land,
p106
aVto grow food, no less,
p107
aVto feed their people
p108
aVin lands that are truly more geographically stinting?
p109
aVThe new landowners are not planning to import new topsoil
p110
aVto make their African acquisitions more arable.
p111
aVAgain, a singular instance of knowledge deficiency.
p112
aa(lp113
VIn the 19th century,
p114
aVour predecessors,
p115
aVjust years removed from the ravages of slavery and the slave trade,
p116
aVwere exploring the Niger and Congo Rivers
p117
aVwith a view to turning Africa's resources to the advantage of its people
p118
aVand to the rest of humanity,
p119
aVand their 20th-century successors were dreaming of harnessing
p120
aVthe powers of the River Congo
p121
aVto light up the whole continent.
p122
aVNow only buccaneer capitalists from Europe
p123
aVare scheming of doing the same,
p124
aVbut for exports to Europe and South Africa.
p125
aVAnd they are even suggesting
p126
aVthat Congolese may not benefit from this scheme,
p127
aVbecause, according to them, Congolese communities are too small
p128
aVto make providing them with electricity
p129
aVa viable concern.
p130
aa(lp131
VThe solution?
p132
aVAfrica must become a knowledge society,
p133
aVa defining characteristic of the modern age.
p134
aVWe neither are, nor are we on the path to becoming,
p135
aVa knowledge society.
p136
aa(lp137
VThings have not always been this way
p138
aVwhen it comes to knowledge production and Africa.
p139
aVIn antiquity, the world went to Africa for intellectual enrichment.
p140
aVThere were celebrated centers of learning,
p141
aVattracting questers from all parts of the then-known world,
p142
aVseeking knowledge about that world.
p143
aVWhat happened then has implications for our present.
p144
aVFor example,
p145
aVhow Roman Africa managed the relationship between settlers and natives
p146
aVbetween the second and fourth centuries of our era
p147
aVmight have something to teach us when it comes to confronting
p148
aVnot-too-dissimilar problems at the present time.
p149
aVBut how many classics departments do we have in our universities?
p150
aVBecause we do not invest in knowledge,
p151
aVpeople come to Africa now
p152
aVnot as a place of intellectual enrichment,
p153
aVbut as a place where they sate their thirst for exotica.
p154
aa(lp155
VYet for the last half-millennium,
p156
aVAfrica has been hemorrhaging and exporting knowledge
p157
aVto the rest of the world.
p158
aVRegardless of the popular description of it as a trade in bodies,
p159
aVthe European trans-Atlantic slave trade and slavery
p160
aVwas one of the most radical and longest programs
p161
aVof African brains export in history.
p162
aVAmerican slave owners may have pretended that Africans were mere brutes,
p163
aVbeasts of burden,
p164
aValmost as inert and dumb as other farm implements
p165
aVthey classified them with in their ledgers.
p166
aVAnd that's what they did.
p167
aa(lp168
VThe enslaved Africans, on the other hand,
p169
aVknew their were embodiments of knowledge.
p170
aVThey were smiths, they were poets,
p171
aVthey were political counselors, they were princes and princesses,
p172
aVthey were mythologists, they were herbologists,
p173
aVthey were chefs.
p174
aVThe list is endless.
p175
aVThey, to take a single example,
p176
aVbrought the knowledge of rice cultivation
p177
aVto the American South.
p178
aVThey created some of the most original civilizational elements
p179
aVfor which the United States is now celebrated.
p180
aVThey deployed their knowledge, for the most part,
p181
aVwithout compensation.
p182
aa(lp183
VFor the last half-millennium, beginning with the slave trade,
p184
aVAfrica has been exporting brains
p185
aVwhile simultaneously breaking the chains of knowledge transmission
p186
aVon the continent itself,
p187
aVwith dire consequences for the systems of knowledge production in Africa.
p188
aVSuccessive generations are cut off from the intellectual production
p189
aVof their predecessors.
p190
aVWe keep producing for external markets
p191
aVwhile beggaring our own internal needs.
p192
aVAt present,
p193
aVmuch of the best knowledge about Africa
p194
aVis neither produced nor housed there,
p195
aVeven when it is produced by Africans.
p196
aVBecause we are dominated by immediate needs
p197
aVand relevant solutions when it comes to what we should know,
p198
aVwe are happy to hand over to others
p199
aVthe responsibility to produce knowledge,
p200
aVincluding knowledge about, of and for us,
p201
aVand to do so far away from us.
p202
aVWe are ever eager to consume knowledge
p203
aVand have but a mere portion of it
p204
aVwithout any anxiety about ownership and location.
p205
aVAfrican universities are now all too content
p206
aVto have e-connections with libraries elsewhere,
p207
aVhaving given up ambitions on building libraries
p208
aVto which the world would come for intellectual edification.
p209
aVControl over who decides what should be stocked on our shelves
p210
aVand how access to collections should be determined
p211
aVare made to rest on our trust in our partners' good faith
p212
aVthat they will not abandon us down the road.
p213
aa(lp214
VThis must change.
p215
aVAfrica must become a place of knowledge again.
p216
aVKnowledge production actually expands the economy.
p217
aVTake archaeological digs, for instance,
p218
aVand their impact on tourism.
p219
aVOur desires to unearth our antiquity,
p220
aVespecially those remote times of which we have no written records,
p221
aVrequires investment in archaeology and related disciplines,
p222
aVe.g., paleoanthropology.
p223
aVYet, although it is our past we seek to know,
p224
aVby sheer serendipity,
p225
aVarchaeology may shed light on the global human experience
p226
aVand yield economic payoffs
p227
aVthat were no part of the original reasons for digging.
p228
aa(lp229
VWe must find a way to make knowledge and its production sexy and rewarding;
p230
aVrewarding, not in the crass sense of moneymaking
p231
aVbut in terms of making it worthwhile to indulge in the pursuit of knowledge,
p232
aVsupport the existence
p233
aVof knowledge-producing groups and intellectuals,
p234
aVensuring that the continent
p235
aVbecomes the immediate locus of knowledge production,
p236
aVdistribution and consumption,
p237
aVand that instead of having its depositories
p238
aVbeyond Africa's boundaries,
p239
aVpeople once more come from the rest of the world,
p240
aVeven if in virtual space, to learn from us.
p241
aVAll this we do as custodians on behalf of common humanity.
p242
aa(lp243
VCreating a knowledge society in Africa,
p244
aVfor me, would be one way to celebrate and simultaneously enhance diversity
p245
aVby infinitely enriching it with material and additional artifacts \u2014
p246
aVartifacts that we furnish
p247
aVby our strivings
p248
aVin the knowledge field.
