VDo you think the world is going to be a better place next year?
p4
aVIn the next decade?
p5
aVCan we end hunger,
p6
aVachieve gender equality,
p7
aVhalt climate change,
p8
aVall in the next 15 years?
p9
aa(lp10
VWell, according to the governments of the world, yes we can.
p11
aVIn the last few days, the leaders of the world,
p12
aVmeeting at the UN in New York,
p13
aVagreed a new set of Global Goals
p14
aVfor the development of the world to 2030.
p15
aVAnd here they are:
p16
aVthese goals are the product of a massive consultation exercise.
p17
aVThe Global Goals are who we, humanity, want to be.
p18
aa(lp19
VNow that's the plan, but can we get there?
p20
aVCan this vision for a better world really be achieved?
p21
aVWell, I'm here today because we've run the numbers,
p22
aVand the answer, shockingly,
p23
aVis that maybe we actually can.
p24
aVBut not with business as usual.
p25
aa(lp26
VNow, the idea that the world is going to get a better place
p27
aVmay seem a little fanciful.
p28
aVWatch the news every day and the world seems to be going backwards, not forwards.
p29
aVAnd let's be frank:
p30
aVit's pretty easy to be skeptical about grand announcements
p31
aVcoming out of the UN.
p32
aa(lp33
VBut please, I invite you to suspend your disbelief for just a moment.
p34
aVBecause back in 2001,
p35
aVthe UN agreed another set of goals, the Millennium Development Goals.
p36
aVAnd the flagship target there was to halve the proportion of people
p37
aVliving in poverty by 2015.
p38
aVThe target was to take from a baseline of 1990,
p39
aVwhen 36 percent of the world's population lived in poverty,
p40
aVto get to 18 percent poverty this year.
p41
aa(lp42
VDid we hit this target?
p43
aVWell, no, we didn't.
p44
aVWe exceeded it.
p45
aVThis year, global poverty is going to fall to 12 percent.
p46
aVNow, that's still not good enough,
p47
aVand the world does still have plenty of problems.
p48
aVBut the pessimists and doomsayers who say that the world can't get better
p49
aVare simply wrong.
p50
aa(lp51
VSo how did we achieve this success?
p52
aVWell, a lot of it was because of economic growth.
p53
aVSome of the biggest reductions in poverty were in countries such as China and India,
p54
aVwhich have seen rapid economic growth in recent years.
p55
aVSo can we pull off the same trick again?
p56
aVCan economic growth get us to the Global Goals?
p57
aVWell, to answer that question,
p58
aVwe need to benchmark where the world is today against the Global Goals
p59
aVand figure out how far we have to travel.
p60
aa(lp61
VBut that ain't easy,
p62
aVbecause the Global Goals aren't just ambitious,
p63
aVthey're also pretty complicated.
p64
aVOver 17 goals, there are then 169 targets
p65
aVand literally hundreds of indicators.
p66
aVAlso, while some of the goals are pretty specific \u2014
p67
aVend hunger \u2014
p68
aVothers are a lot vaguer \u2014
p69
aVpromote peaceful and tolerant societies.
p70
aa(lp71
VSo to help us with this benchmarking,
p72
aVI'm going to use a tool called the Social Progress Index.
p73
aVWhat this does is measures all the stuff the Global Goals are trying to achieve,
p74
aVbut sums it up into a single number that we can use as our benchmark
p75
aVand track progress over time.
p76
aa(lp77
VThe Social Progress Index basically asks three fundamental questions
p78
aVabout a society.
p79
aVFirst of all, does everyone have the basic needs of survival:
p80
aVfood, water, shelter, safety?
p81
aVSecondly, does everyone have the building blocks of a better life:
p82
aVeducation, information, health and a sustainable environment?
p83
aVAnd does everyone have the opportunity to improve their lives,
p84
aVthrough rights, freedom of choice, freedom from discrimination,
p85
aVand access to the world's most advanced knowledge?
p86
aa(lp87
VThe Social Progress Index sums all this together using 52 indicators
p88
aVto create an aggregate score on a scale of 0 to 100.
p89
aVAnd what we find is that there's a wide diversity of performance
p90
aVin the world today.
p91
aVThe highest performing country, Norway, scores 88.
p92
aVThe lowest performing country, Central African Republic, scores 31.
p93
aVAnd we can add up all the countries together,
p94
aVweighting for the different population sizes,
p95
aVand that global score is 61.
p96
aVIn concrete terms,
p97
aVthat means that the average human being is living on a level of social progress
p98
aVabout the same of Cuba or Kazakhstan today.
p99
aa(lp100
VThat's where we are today: 61 out of 100.
p101
aVWhat do we have to get to to achieve the Global Goals?
p102
aa(lp103
VNow, the Global Goals are certainly ambitious,
p104
aVbut they're not about turning the world into Norway in just 15 years.
p105
aVSo having looked at the numbers, my estimate is that a score of 75
p106
aVwould not only be a giant leap forward in human well-being,
p107
aVit would also count as hitting the Global Goals target.
p108
aVSo there's our target, 75 out of 100.
p109
aVCan we get there?
p110
aa(lp111
VWell, the Social Progress Index can help us calculate this,
p112
aVbecause as you might have noticed,
p113
aVthere are no economic indicators in there;
p114
aVthere's no GDP or economic growth in the Social Progress Index model.
p115
aVAnd what that lets us do is understand the relationship
p116
aVbetween economic growth and social progress.
p117
aa(lp118
VLet me show you on this chart.
p119
aVSo here on the vertical axis, I've put social progress,
p120
aVthe stuff the Global Goals are trying to achieve.
p121
aVHigher is better.
p122
aVAnd then on the horizontal axis, is GDP per capita.
p123
aVFurther to the right means richer.
p124
aVAnd in there, I'm now going to put all the countries of the world,
p125
aVeach one represented by a dot,
p126
aVand on top of that I'm going to put the regression line
p127
aVthat shows the average relationship.
p128
aVAnd what this tells us is that as we get richer,
p129
aVsocial progress does tend to improve.
p130
aVHowever, as we get richer, each extra dollar of GDP
p131
aVis buying us less and less social progress.
p132
aVAnd now we can use this information to start building our forecast.
p133
aVSo here is the world in 2015.
p134
aVWe have a social progress score of 61
p135
aVand a GDP per capita of $14,000.
p136
aVAnd the place we're trying to get to, remember, is 75, that Global Goals target.
p137
aVSo here we are today, $14,000 per capita GDP.
p138
aVHow rich are we going to be in 2030?
p139
aVThat's what we need to know next.
p140
aVWell, the best forecast we can find comes from the US Department of Agriculture,
p141
aVwhich forecasts 3.1 percent average global economic growth
p142
aVover the next 15 years,
p143
aVwhich means that in 2030, if they're right,
p144
aVper capita GDP will be about $23,000.
p145
aVSo now the question is: if we get that much richer,
p146
aVhow much social progress are we going to get?
p147
aVWell, we asked a team of economists at Deloitte
p148
aVwho checked and crunched the numbers,
p149
aVand they came back and said, well, look: if the world's average wealth goes
p150
aVfrom $14,000 a year to $23,000 a year,
p151
aVsocial progress is going to increase
p152
aVfrom 61 to 62.4.
p153
aa(lp154
V(Laughter)
p155
aa(lp156
VJust 62.4. Just a tiny increase.
p157
aa(lp158
VNow this seems a bit strange.
p159
aVEconomic growth seems to have really helped
p160
aVin the fight against poverty,
p161
aVbut it doesn't seem to be having much impact
p162
aVon trying to get to the Global Goals.
p163
aVSo what's going on?
p164
aVWell, I think there are two things.
p165
aVThe first is that in a way, we're the victims of our own success.
p166
aVWe've used up the easy wins from economic growth,
p167
aVand now we're moving on to harder problems.
p168
aVAnd also, we know that economic growth comes with costs as well as benefits.
p169
aVThere are costs to the environment, costs from new health problems like obesity.
p170
aa(lp171
VSo that's the bad news.
p172
aVWe're not going to get to the Global Goals just by getting richer.
p173
aa(lp174
VSo are the pessimists right?
p175
aa(lp176
VWell, maybe not.
p177
aVBecause the Social Progress Index also has some very good news.
p178
aVLet me take you back to that regression line.
p179
aVSo this is the average relationship between GDP and social progress,
p180
aVand this is what our last forecast was based on.
p181
aVBut as you saw already,
p182
aVthere is actually lots of noise around this trend line.
p183
aa(lp184
VWhat that tells us, quite simply,
p185
aVis that GDP is not destiny.
p186
aVWe have countries that are underperforming
p187
aVon social progress, relative to their wealth.
p188
aVRussia has lots of natural resource wealth,
p189
aVbut lots of social problems.
p190
aVChina has boomed economically,
p191
aVbut hasn't made much headway on human rights or environmental issues.
p192
aVIndia has a space program and millions of people without toilets.
p193
aVNow, on the other hand, we have countries that are overperforming
p194
aVon social progress relative to their GDP.
p195
aVCosta Rica has prioritized education, health and environmental sustainability,
p196
aVand as a result, it's achieving a very high level of social progress,
p197
aVdespite only having a rather modest GDP.
p198
aVAnd Costa Rica's not alone.
p199
aVFrom poor countries like Rwanda to richer countries like New Zealand,
p200
aVwe see that it's possible to get lots of social progress,
p201
aVeven if your GDP is not so great.
p202
aa(lp203
VAnd that's really important, because it tells us two things.
p204
aVFirst of all, it tells us that we already in the world have the solutions
p205
aVto many of the problems that the Global Goals are trying to solve.
p206
aVIt also tells us that we're not slaves to GDP.
p207
aVOur choices matter: if we prioritize the well-being of people,
p208
aVthen we can make a lot more progress than our GDP might expect.
p209
aa(lp210
VHow much? Enough to get us to the Global Goals?
p211
aVWell, let's look at some numbers.
p212
aVWhat we know already: the world today is scoring 61 on social progress,
p213
aVand the place we want to get to is 75.
p214
aVIf we rely on economic growth alone,
p215
aVwe're going to get to 62.4.
p216
aVSo let's assume now that we can get the countries that are currently
p217
aVunderperforming on social progress \u2014 the Russia, China, Indias \u2014
p218
aVjust up to the average.
p219
aVHow much social progress does that get us?
p220
aVWell, that takes us to 65.
p221
aVIt's a bit better, but still quite a long way to go.
p222
aVSo let's get a little bit more optimistic and say,
p223
aVwhat if every country gets a little bit better
p224
aVat turning its wealth into well-being?
p225
aVWell then, we get to 67.
p226
aVAnd now let's be even bolder still.
p227
aVWhat if every country in the world chose to be like Costa Rica
p228
aVin prioritizing human well-being,
p229
aVusing its wealth for the well-being of its citizens?
p230
aVWell then, we get to nearly 73, very close to the Global Goals.
p231
aa(lp232
VCan we achieve the Global Goals?
p233
aVCertainly not with business as usual.
p234
aVEven a flood tide of economic growth is not going to get us there,
p235
aVif it just raises the mega-yachts and the super-wealthy
p236
aVand leaves the rest behind.
p237
aVIf we're going to achieve the Global Goals we have to do things differently.
p238
aVWe have to prioritize social progress, and really scale solutions
p239
aVaround the world.
p240
aVI believe the Global Goals are a historic opportunity,
p241
aVbecause the world's leaders have promised to deliver them.
p242
aVLet's not dismiss the goals or slide into pessimism;
p243
aVlet's hold them to that promise.
p244
aVAnd we need to hold them to that promise by holding them accountable,
p245
aVtracking their progress all the way through the next 15 years.
p246
aa(lp247
VAnd I want to finish by showing you
p248
aVa way to do that, called the People's Report Card.
p249
aVThe People's Report Card brings together all this data into a simple framework
p250
aVthat we'll all be familiar with from our school days,
p251
aVto hold them to account.
p252
aVIt grades our performance on the Global Goals
p253
aVon a scale from F to A,
p254
aVwhere F is humanity at its worst, and A is humanity at its best.
p255
aVOur world today is scoring a C-.
p256
aVThe Global Goals are all about getting to an A,
p257
aVand that's why we're going to be updating the People's Report Card annually,
p258
aVfor the world and for all the countries of the world,
p259
aVso we can hold our leaders to account
p260
aVto achieve this target and fulfill this promise.
p261
aVBecause getting to the Global Goals will only happen if we do things differently,
p262
aVif our leaders do things differently,
p263
aVand for that to happen, that needs us to demand it.
p264
aa(lp265
VSo let's reject business as usual.
p266
aVLet's demand a different path.
p267
aVLet's choose the world that we want.
p268
aa(lp269
VThank you.
p270
aa(lp271
V(Applause)
p272
aa(lp273
VBruno Giussani: Thank you, Michael.
p274
aVMichael, just one question: the Millennium Development Goals
p275
aVestablished 15 years ago,
p276
aVthey were kind of applying to every country
p277
aVbut it turned out to be really a scorecard for emerging countries.
p278
aVNow the new Global Goals are explicitly universal.
p279
aVThey ask for every country to show action and to show progress.
p280
aVHow can I, as a private citizen, use the report card
p281
aVto create pressure for action?
p282
aa(lp283
VMichael Green: This is a really important point; it's a big shift in priorities \u2014
p284
aVit's no longer about poor countries and just poverty.
p285
aVIt's about every country.
p286
aVAnd every country is going to have challenges in getting to the Global Goals.
p287
aVEven, I'm sorry to say, Bruno, Switzerland has got to work to do.
p288
aVAnd so that's why we're going to produce these report cards in 2016
p289
aVfor every country in the world.
p290
aVThen we can really see, how are we doing?
p291
aVAnd it's not going to be rich countries scoring straight A's.
p292
aVAnd that, then, I think, is to provide a point of focus
p293
aVfor people to start demanding action and start demanding progress.
p294
aa(lp295
VBG: Thank you very much.
