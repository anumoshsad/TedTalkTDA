VSo that's Johnny Depp, of course.
p4
aVAnd that's Johnny Depp's shoulder.
p5
aVAnd that's Johnny Depp's famous shoulder tattoo.
p6
aVSome of you might know that, in 1990,
p7
aVDepp got engaged to Winona Ryder,
p8
aVand he had tattooed on his right shoulder
p9
aV"Winona forever."
p10
aVAnd then three years later \u2014
p11
aVwhich in fairness, kind of is forever by Hollywood standards \u2014
p12
aVthey broke up,
p13
aVand Johnny went and got a little bit of repair work done.
p14
aVAnd now his shoulder says, "Wino forever."
p15
aa(lp16
V(Laughter)
p17
aa(lp18
VSo like Johnny Depp,
p19
aVand like 25 percent of Americans
p20
aVbetween the ages of 16 and 50,
p21
aVI have a tattoo.
p22
aVI first started thinking about getting it in my mid-20s,
p23
aVbut I deliberately waited a really long time.
p24
aVBecause we all know people
p25
aVwho have gotten tattoos when they were 17
p26
aVor 19 or 23
p27
aVand regretted it by the time they were 30.
p28
aVThat didn't happen to me.
p29
aVI got my tattoo when I was 29,
p30
aVand I regretted it instantly.
p31
aVAnd by "regretted it,"
p32
aVI mean that I stepped outside of the tattoo place \u2014
p33
aVthis is just a couple miles from here
p34
aVdown on the Lower East Side \u2014
p35
aVand I had a massive emotional meltdown in broad daylight
p36
aVon the corner of East Broadway and Canal Street.
p37
aV(Laughter)
p38
aVWhich is a great place to do it because nobody cares.
p39
aV(Laughter)
p40
aVAnd then I went home that night, and I had an even larger emotional meltdown,
p41
aVwhich I'll say more about in a minute.
p42
aa(lp43
VAnd this was all actually quite shocking to me,
p44
aVbecause prior to this moment,
p45
aVI had prided myself
p46
aVon having absolutely no regrets.
p47
aVI made a lot of mistakes
p48
aVand dumb decisions, of course.
p49
aVI do that hourly.
p50
aVBut I had always felt like, look, you know,
p51
aVI made the best choice I could make
p52
aVgiven who I was then,
p53
aVgiven the information I had on hand.
p54
aVI learned a lesson from it.
p55
aVIt somehow got me to where I am in life right now.
p56
aVAnd okay, I wouldn't change it.
p57
aVIn other words, I had drunk our great cultural Kool-Aid about regret,
p58
aVwhich is that lamenting things that occurred in the past
p59
aVis an absolute waste of time,
p60
aVthat we should always look forward and not backward,
p61
aVand that one of the noblest and best things we can do
p62
aVis strive to live a life free of regrets.
p63
aa(lp64
VThis idea is nicely captured by this quote:
p65
aV"Things without all remedy
p66
aVshould be without regard;
p67
aVwhat's done is done."
p68
aVAnd it seems like kind of an admirable philosophy at first \u2014
p69
aVsomething we might all agree to sign onto ...
p70
aVuntil I tell you who said it.
p71
aVRight, so this is Lady MacBeth
p72
aVbasically telling her husband to stop being such a wuss
p73
aVfor feeling bad about murdering people.
p74
aVAnd as it happens, Shakespeare was onto something here,
p75
aVas he generally was.
p76
aVBecause the inability to experience regret
p77
aVis actually one of the diagnostic characteristics
p78
aVof sociopaths.
p79
aVIt's also, by the way, a characteristic of certain kinds of brain damage.
p80
aVSo people who have damage
p81
aVto their orbital frontal cortex
p82
aVseem to be unable to feel regret
p83
aVin the face of even obviously very poor decisions.
p84
aVSo if, in fact, you want to live a life free of regret,
p85
aVthere is an option open to you.
p86
aVIt's called a lobotomy.
p87
aVBut if you want to be fully functional
p88
aVand fully human
p89
aVand fully humane,
p90
aVI think you need to learn to live, not without regret, but with it.
p91
aa(lp92
VSo let's start off by defining some terms.
p93
aVWhat is regret?
p94
aVRegret is the emotion we experience
p95
aVwhen we think that our present situation
p96
aVcould be better or happier
p97
aVif we had done something different in the past.
p98
aVSo in other words, regret requires two things.
p99
aVIt requires, first of all, agency \u2014 we had to make a decision in the first place.
p100
aVAnd second of all, it requires imagination.
p101
aVWe need to be able to imagine going back and making a different choice,
p102
aVand then we need to be able to kind of spool this imaginary record forward
p103
aVand imagine how things would be playing out in our present.
p104
aVAnd in fact, the more we have of either of these things \u2014
p105
aVthe more agency and the more imagination
p106
aVwith respect to a given regret,
p107
aVthe more acute that regret will be.
p108
aa(lp109
VSo let's say for instance
p110
aVthat you're on your way to your best friend's wedding
p111
aVand you're trying to get to the airport and you're stuck in terrible traffic,
p112
aVand you finally arrive at your gate
p113
aVand you've missed your flight.
p114
aVYou're going to experience more regret in that situation
p115
aVif you missed your flight by three minutes
p116
aVthan if you missed it by 20.
p117
aVWhy?
p118
aVWell because, if you miss your flight by three minutes,
p119
aVit is painfully easy to imagine
p120
aVthat you could have made different decisions
p121
aVthat would have led to a better outcome.
p122
aV"I should have taken the bridge and not the tunnel.
p123
aVI should have gone through that yellow light."
p124
aVThese are the classic conditions that create regret.
p125
aVWe feel regret when we think we are responsible
p126
aVfor a decision that came out badly,
p127
aVbut almost came out well.
p128
aa(lp129
VNow within that framework,
p130
aVwe can obviously experience regret about a lot of different things.
p131
aVThis session today is about behavioral economics.
p132
aVAnd most of what we know about regret
p133
aVcomes to us out of that domain.
p134
aVWe have a vast body of literature
p135
aVon consumer and financial decisions
p136
aVand the regrets associated with them \u2014
p137
aVbuyer's remorse, basically.
p138
aVBut then finally, it occurred to some researchers to step back
p139
aVand say, well okay, but overall,
p140
aVwhat do we regret most in life?
p141
aVHere's what the answers turn out to look like.
p142
aa(lp143
VSo top six regrets \u2014
p144
aVthe things we regret most in life:
p145
aVNumber one by far, education.
p146
aV33 percent of all of our regrets
p147
aVpertain to decisions we made about education.
p148
aVWe wish we'd gotten more of it.
p149
aVWe wish we'd taken better advantage of the education that we did have.
p150
aVWe wish we'd chosen to study a different topic.
p151
aVOthers very high on our list of regrets
p152
aVinclude career, romance, parenting,
p153
aVvarious decisions and choices about our sense of self
p154
aVand how we spend our leisure time \u2014
p155
aVor actually more specifically,
p156
aVhow we fail to spend our leisure time.
p157
aVThe remaining regrets
p158
aVpertain to these things:
p159
aVfinance, family issues unrelated to romance or parenting,
p160
aVhealth, friends,
p161
aVspirituality and community.
p162
aa(lp163
VSo in other words, we know most of what we know about regret
p164
aVby the study of finance.
p165
aVBut it turns out, when you look overall at what people regret in life,
p166
aVyou know what, our financial decisions don't even rank.
p167
aVThey account for less than three percent of our total regrets.
p168
aVSo if you're sitting there stressing
p169
aVabout large cap versus small cap,
p170
aVor company A versus company B,
p171
aVor should you buy the Subaru or the Prius,
p172
aVyou know what, let it go.
p173
aVOdds are, you're not going to care in five years.
p174
aa(lp175
VBut for these things that we actually do really care about
p176
aVand do experience profound regret around,
p177
aVwhat does that experience feel like?
p178
aVWe all know the short answer.
p179
aVIt feels terrible. Regret feels awful.
p180
aVBut it turns out that regret feels awful
p181
aVin four very specific and consistent ways.
p182
aVSo the first consistent component of regret
p183
aVis basically denial.
p184
aVWhen I went home that night after getting my tattoo,
p185
aVI basically stayed up all night.
p186
aVAnd for the first several hours,
p187
aVthere was exactly one thought in my head.
p188
aVAnd the thought was,
p189
aV"Make it go away!"
p190
aVThis is an unbelievably primitive emotional response.
p191
aVI mean, it's right up there with, "I want my mommy!"
p192
aVWe're not trying to solve the problem.
p193
aVWe're not trying to understand how the problem came about.
p194
aVWe just want it to vanish.
p195
aa(lp196
VThe second characteristic component of regret
p197
aVis a sense of bewilderment.
p198
aVSo the other thing I thought about there in my bedroom that night
p199
aVwas, "How could I have done that?
p200
aVWhat was I thinking?"
p201
aVThis real sense of alienation
p202
aVfrom the part of us that made a decision we regret.
p203
aVWe can't identify with that part.
p204
aVWe don't understand that part.
p205
aVAnd we certainly don't have any empathy for that part \u2014
p206
aVwhich explains the third consistent component of regret,
p207
aVwhich is an intense desire to punish ourselves.
p208
aVThat's why, in the face of our regret,
p209
aVthe thing we consistently say is, "I could have kicked myself."
p210
aVThe fourth component here
p211
aVis that regret is what psychologists call perseverative.
p212
aVTo perseverate means to focus obsessively and repeatedly
p213
aVon the exact same thing.
p214
aVNow the effect of perseveration
p215
aVis to basically take these first three components of regret
p216
aVand put them on an infinite loop.
p217
aVSo it's not that I sat there in my bedroom that night,
p218
aVthinking, "Make it go away."
p219
aVIt's that I sat there and I thought,
p220
aV"Make it go away. Make it go away.
p221
aVMake it go away. Make it go away."
p222
aVSo if you look at the psychological literature,
p223
aVthese are the four consistent defining components of regret.
p224
aa(lp225
VBut I want to suggest that there's also a fifth one.
p226
aVAnd I think of this
p227
aVas a kind of existential wake-up call.
p228
aVThat night in my apartment,
p229
aVafter I got done kicking myself and so forth,
p230
aVI lay in bed for a long time,
p231
aVand I thought about skin grafts.
p232
aVAnd then I thought about how,
p233
aVmuch as travel insurance doesn't cover acts of God,
p234
aVprobably my health insurance did not cover acts of idiocy.
p235
aVIn point of fact, no insurance covers acts of idiocy.
p236
aVThe whole point of acts of idiocy
p237
aVis that they leave you totally uninsured;
p238
aVthey leave you exposed to the world
p239
aVand exposed to your own vulnerability and fallibility
p240
aVin face of, frankly, a fairly indifferent universe.
p241
aa(lp242
VThis is obviously an incredibly painful experience.
p243
aVAnd I think it's particularly painful for us now in the West
p244
aVin the grips of what I sometimes think of
p245
aVas a Control-Z culture \u2014
p246
aVControl-Z like the computer command,
p247
aVundo.
p248
aVWe're incredibly used to not having to face
p249
aVlife's hard realities, in a certain sense.
p250
aVWe think we can throw money at the problem
p251
aVor throw technology at the problem \u2014
p252
aVwe can undo and unfriend
p253
aVand unfollow.
p254
aVAnd the problem is that there are certain things that happen in life
p255
aVthat we desperately want to change
p256
aVand we cannot.
p257
aVSometimes instead of Control-Z,
p258
aVwe actually have zero control.
p259
aVAnd for those of us who are control freaks and perfectionists \u2014
p260
aVand I know where of I speak \u2014
p261
aVthis is really hard,
p262
aVbecause we want to do everything ourselves and we want to do it right.
p263
aa(lp264
VNow there is a case to be made
p265
aVthat control freaks and perfectionists should not get tattoos,
p266
aVand I'm going to return to that point in a few minutes.
p267
aVBut first I want to say
p268
aVthat the intensity and persistence
p269
aVwith which we experience these emotional components of regret
p270
aVis obviously going to vary
p271
aVdepending on the specific thing that we're feeling regretful about.
p272
aVSo for instance, here's one of my favorite
p273
aVautomatic generators of regret in modern life.
p274
aV(Laughter)
p275
aVText: Relpy to all.
p276
aVAnd the amazing thing
p277
aVabout this really insidious technological innovation
p278
aVis that even just with this one thing,
p279
aVwe can experience a huge range of regret.
p280
aVYou can accidentally hit "reply all" to an email
p281
aVand torpedo a relationship.
p282
aVOr you can just have an incredibly embarrassing day at work.
p283
aVOr you can have your last day at work.
p284
aa(lp285
VAnd this doesn't even touch
p286
aVon the really profound regrets of a life.
p287
aVBecause of course, sometimes we do make decisions
p288
aVthat have irrevocable and terrible consequences,
p289
aVeither for our own or for other people's
p290
aVhealth and happiness and livelihoods,
p291
aVand in the very worst case scenario, even their lives.
p292
aVNow obviously, those kinds of regrets
p293
aVare incredibly piercing and enduring.
p294
aVI mean, even the stupid "reply all" regrets
p295
aVcan leave us in a fit of excruciating agony for days.
p296
aa(lp297
VSo how are we supposed to live with this?
p298
aVI want to suggest that there's three things
p299
aVthat help us to make our peace with regret.
p300
aVAnd the first of these
p301
aVis to take some comfort in its universality.
p302
aVIf you Google regret and tattoo,
p303
aVyou will get 11.5 million hits.
p304
aV(Laughter)
p305
aVThe FDA estimates
p306
aVthat of all the Americans who have tattoos,
p307
aV17 percent of us regret getting them.
p308
aVThat is Johnny Depp and me
p309
aVand our seven million friends.
p310
aVAnd that's just regret about tattoos.
p311
aVWe are all in this together.
p312
aa(lp313
VThe second way that we can help make our peace with regret
p314
aVis to laugh at ourselves.
p315
aVNow in my case, this really wasn't a problem,
p316
aVbecause it's actually very easy to laugh at yourself
p317
aVwhen you're 29 years old and you want your mommy
p318
aVbecause you don't like your new tattoo.
p319
aVBut it might seem like a kind of cruel or glib suggestion
p320
aVwhen it comes to these more profound regrets.
p321
aVI don't think that's the case though.
p322
aVAll of us who've experienced regret
p323
aVthat contains real pain and real grief
p324
aVunderstand that humor and even black humor
p325
aVplays a crucial role in helping us survive.
p326
aVIt connects the poles of our lives back together,
p327
aVthe positive and the negative,
p328
aVand it sends a little current of life back into us.
p329
aa(lp330
VThe third way that I think we can help make our peace with regret
p331
aVis through the passage of time,
p332
aVwhich, as we know, heals all wounds \u2014
p333
aVexcept for tattoos, which are permanent.
p334
aVSo it's been several years
p335
aVsince I got my own tattoo.
p336
aVAnd do you guys just want to see it?
p337
aVAll right.
p338
aVActually, you know what, I should warn you,
p339
aVyou're going to be disappointed.
p340
aVBecause it's actually not that hideous.
p341
aVI didn't tattoo Marilyn Manson's face
p342
aVon some indiscreet part of myself or something.
p343
aVWhen other people see my tattoo,
p344
aVfor the most part they like how it looks.
p345
aVIt's just that I don't like how it looks.
p346
aVAnd as I said earlier, I'm a perfectionist.
p347
aVBut I'll let you see it anyway.
p348
aa(lp349
VThis is my tattoo.
p350
aVI can guess what some of you are thinking.
p351
aVSo let me reassure you about something.
p352
aVSome of your own regrets
p353
aVare also not as ugly as you think they are.
p354
aVI got this tattoo
p355
aVbecause I spent most of my 20s
p356
aVliving outside the country and traveling.
p357
aVAnd when I came and settled in New York afterward,
p358
aVI was worried that I would forget
p359
aVsome of the most important lessons that I learned during that time.
p360
aVSpecifically the two things I learned about myself
p361
aVthat I most didn't want to forget
p362
aVwas how important it felt to keep exploring
p363
aVand, simultaneously, how important it is
p364
aVto somehow keep an eye on your own true north.
p365
aVAnd what I loved about this image of the compass
p366
aVwas that I felt like it encapsulated both of these ideas
p367
aVin one simple image.
p368
aVAnd I thought it might serve as a kind of permanent mnemonic device.
p369
aa(lp370
VWell it did.
p371
aVBut it turns out, it doesn't remind me of the thing I thought it would;
p372
aVit reminds me constantly of something else instead.
p373
aVIt actually reminds me
p374
aVof the most important lesson regret can teach us,
p375
aVwhich is also one of the most important lessons life teaches us.
p376
aVAnd ironically, I think it's probably the single most important thing
p377
aVI possibly could have tattooed onto my body \u2014
p378
aVpartly as a writer,
p379
aVbut also just as a human being.
p380
aVHere's the thing,
p381
aVif we have goals
p382
aVand dreams,
p383
aVand we want to do our best,
p384
aVand if we love people
p385
aVand we don't want to hurt them or lose them,
p386
aVwe should feel pain when things go wrong.
p387
aVThe point isn't to live without any regrets.
p388
aVThe point is to not hate ourselves for having them.
p389
aa(lp390
VThe lesson that I ultimately learned from my tattoo
p391
aVand that I want to leave you with today
p392
aVis this:
p393
aVWe need to learn to love
p394
aVthe flawed, imperfect things
p395
aVthat we create
p396
aVand to forgive ourselves for creating them.
p397
aVRegret doesn't remind us that we did badly.
p398
aVIt reminds us that we know we can do better.
p399
