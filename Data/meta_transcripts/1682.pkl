aa(lp7
VSo, I didn't always make my living from music.
p8
aVFor about the five years after graduating
p9
aVfrom an upstanding liberal arts university,
p10
aVthis was my day job.
p11
aa(lp12
V(Laughter)
p13
aa(lp14
VI was a self-employed living statue called the Eight-Foot Bride,
p15
aVand I love telling people I did this for a job,
p16
aVbecause everybody always wants to know,
p17
aVwho are these freaks in real life.
p18
aa(lp19
V(Laughter)
p20
aa(lp21
VHello.
p22
aa(lp23
VI painted myself white one day, stood on a box,
p24
aVput a hat or a can at my feet,
p25
aVand when someone came by and dropped in money,
p26
aVI handed them a flower \u2014
p27
aVand some intense eye contact.
p28
aVAnd if they didn't take the flower,
p29
aVI threw in a gesture of sadness and longing \u2014
p30
aVas they walked away.
p31
aa(lp32
V(Laughter)
p33
aa(lp34
VSo I had the most profound encounters with people,
p35
aVespecially lonely people
p36
aVwho looked like they hadn't talked to anyone in weeks,
p37
aVand we would get this beautiful moment of prolonged eye contact
p38
aVbeing allowed in a city street,
p39
aVand we would sort of fall in love a little bit.
p40
aVAnd my eyes would say \u2014
p41
aV"Thank you.
p42
aVI see you."
p43
aVAnd their eyes would say \u2014
p44
aV"Nobody ever sees me.
p45
aVThank you."
p46
aa(lp47
VI would get harassed sometimes.
p48
aVPeople would yell at me from their cars.
p49
aV"Get a job!"
p50
aV(Laughing) And I'd be, like,
p51
aV"This is my job."
p52
aVBut it hurt, because it made me fear
p53
aVthat I was somehow doing something un-joblike
p54
aVand unfair, shameful.
p55
aVI had no idea how perfect a real education I was getting
p56
aVfor the music business on this box.
p57
aVAnd for the economists out there,
p58
aVyou may be interested to know I actually made a pretty predictable income,
p59
aVwhich was shocking to me, given I had no regular customers,
p60
aVbut pretty much 60 bucks on a Tuesday, 90 bucks on a Friday.
p61
aVIt was consistent.
p62
aa(lp63
VAnd meanwhile, I was touring locally and playing in nightclubs
p64
aVwith my band, the Dresden Dolls.
p65
aVThis was me on piano, a genius drummer.
p66
aVI wrote the songs, and eventually
p67
aVwe started making enough money that I could quit being a statue,
p68
aVand as we started touring,
p69
aVI really didn't want to lose this sense
p70
aVof direct connection with people, because I loved it.
p71
aVSo after all of our shows, we would sign autographs
p72
aVand hug fans and hang out and talk to people,
p73
aVand we made an art out of asking people to help us and join us,
p74
aVand I would track down local musicians and artists
p75
aVand they would set up outside of our shows,
p76
aVand they would pass the hat,
p77
aVand then they would come in and join us onstage,
p78
aVso we had this rotating smorgasbord of weird, random circus guests.
p79
aa(lp80
VAnd then Twitter came along,
p81
aVand made things even more magic,
p82
aVbecause I could ask instantly for anything anywhere.
p83
aVSo I would need a piano to practice on,
p84
aVand an hour later I would be at a fan's house.
p85
aVThis is in London.
p86
aVPeople would bring home-cooked food to us
p87
aVall over the world backstage and feed us and eat with us.
p88
aVThis is in Seattle.
p89
aVFans who worked in museums and stores
p90
aVand any kind of public space would wave their hands
p91
aVif I would decide to do a last-minute, spontaneous, free gig.
p92
aVThis is a library in Auckland.
p93
aVOn Saturday I tweeted for this crate and hat,
p94
aVbecause I did not want to schlep them from the East Coast,
p95
aVand they showed up care of this dude, Chris, from Newport Beach,
p96
aVwho says hello.
p97
aVI once tweeted, "Where in Melbourne can I buy a neti pot?"
p98
aVAnd a nurse from a hospital drove one
p99
aVright at that moment to the cafe I was in,
p100
aVand I bought her a smoothie
p101
aVand we sat there talking about nursing and death.
p102
aa(lp103
VAnd I love this kind of random closeness,
p104
aVwhich is lucky, because I do a lot of couchsurfing.
p105
aVIn mansions where everyone in my crew gets their own room
p106
aVbut there's no wireless,
p107
aVand in punk squats,
p108
aVeveryone on the floor in one room with no toilets
p109
aVbut with wireless, clearly making it the better option.
p110
aa(lp111
V(Laughter)
p112
aa(lp113
VMy crew once pulled our van up to a really poor Miami neighborhood
p114
aVand we found out that our couchsurfing host for the night
p115
aVwas an 18-year-old girl, still living at home,
p116
aVand her family were all undocumented immigrants from Honduras.
p117
aVAnd that night, her whole family
p118
aVtook the couches and she slept together with her mom
p119
aVso that we could take their beds.
p120
aVAnd I lay there thinking,
p121
aVthese people have so little.
p122
aVIs this fair?
p123
aVAnd in the morning,
p124
aVher mom taught us how to try to make tortillas
p125
aVand wanted to give me a Bible,
p126
aVand she took me aside and she said to me in her broken English,
p127
aV"Your music has helped my daughter so much.
p128
aVThank you for staying here. We're all so grateful."
p129
aVAnd I thought, this is fair.
p130
aVThis is this.
p131
aa(lp132
VA couple of months later, I was in Manhattan,
p133
aVand I tweeted for a crash pad, and at midnight,
p134
aVI'm on the Lower East Side,
p135
aVand it occurs to me I've never actually done this alone.
p136
aVI've always been with my band or my crew.
p137
aVIs this what stupid people do?
p138
aa(lp139
V(Laughter)
p140
aa(lp141
VIs this how stupid people die?
p142
aVAnd before I can change my mind, the door busts open.
p143
aVShe's an artist.
p144
aVHe's a financial blogger for Reuters,
p145
aVand they're pouring me a glass of red wine
p146
aVand offering me a bath,
p147
aVand I have had thousands of nights like that and like that.
p148
aa(lp149
VSo I couchsurf a lot. I also crowdsurf a lot.
p150
aVI maintain couchsurfing and crowdsurfing
p151
aVare basically the same thing.
p152
aVYou're falling into the audience
p153
aVand you're trusting each other.
p154
aVI once asked an opening band of mine
p155
aVif they wanted to go out into the crowd and pass the hat
p156
aVto get some extra money, something that I did a lot.
p157
aVAnd as usual, the band was psyched,
p158
aVbut there was this one guy in the band
p159
aVwho told me he just couldn't bring himself to go out there.
p160
aVIt felt too much like begging to stand there with the hat.
p161
aVAnd I recognized his fear
p162
aVof "Is this fair?"
p163
aVand "Get a job."
p164
aa(lp165
VAnd meanwhile, my band is becoming bigger and bigger.
p166
aVWe sign with a major label.
p167
aVAnd our music is a cross between punk and cabaret.
p168
aVIt's not for everybody.
p169
aVWell, maybe it's for you.
p170
aa(lp171
V(Laughter)
p172
aa(lp173
VWe sign, and there's all this hype leading up to our next record.
p174
aVAnd it comes out and it sells about 25,000 copies
p175
aVin the first few weeks,
p176
aVand the label considers this a failure.
p177
aa(lp178
VI was like, "25,000, isn't that a lot?"
p179
aa(lp180
VThey said, "No, the sales are going down.
p181
aVIt's a failure."
p182
aVAnd they walk off.
p183
aa(lp184
VRight at this same time, I'm signing and hugging after a gig,
p185
aVand a guy comes up to me
p186
aVand hands me a $10 bill,
p187
aVand he says,
p188
aV"I'm sorry, I burned your CD from a friend."
p189
aa(lp190
V(Laughter)
p191
aa(lp192
V"But I read your blog, I know you hate your label.
p193
aVI just want you to have this money."
p194
aa(lp195
VAnd this starts happening all the time.
p196
aVI become the hat after my own gigs,
p197
aVbut I have to physically stand there and take the help from people,
p198
aVand unlike the guy in the opening band,
p199
aVI've actually had a lot of practice standing there.
p200
aVThank you.
p201
aa(lp202
VAnd this is the moment I decide
p203
aVI'm just going to give away my music for free
p204
aVonline whenever possible,
p205
aVso it's like Metallica over here, Napster, bad;
p206
aVAmanda Palmer over here,
p207
aVand I'm going to encourage torrenting, downloading, sharing,
p208
aVbut I'm going to ask for help,
p209
aVbecause I saw it work on the street.
p210
aVSo I fought my way off my label, and for my next project
p211
aVwith my new band, the Grand Theft Orchestra,
p212
aVI turned to crowdfunding.
p213
aVAnd I fell into those thousands of connections that I'd made,
p214
aVand I asked my crowd to catch me.
p215
aVAnd the goal was 100,000 dollars.
p216
aVMy fans backed me at nearly 1.2 million,
p217
aVwhich was the biggest music crowdfunding project to date.
p218
aa(lp219
V(Applause)
p220
aa(lp221
VAnd you can see how many people it is.
p222
aVIt's about 25,000 people.
p223
aa(lp224
VAnd the media asked,
p225
aV"Amanda, the music business is tanking and you encourage piracy.
p226
aVHow did you make all these people pay for music?"
p227
aVAnd the real answer is, I didn't make them.
p228
aVI asked them.
p229
aVAnd through the very act of asking people,
p230
aVI'd connected with them,
p231
aVand when you connect with them, people want to help you.
p232
aVIt's kind of counterintuitive for a lot of artists.
p233
aVThey don't want to ask for things.
p234
aVBut it's not easy.
p235
aVIt's not easy to ask.
p236
aVAnd a lot of artists have a problem with this.
p237
aVAsking makes you vulnerable.
p238
aa(lp239
VAnd I got a lot of criticism online,
p240
aVafter my Kickstarter went big,
p241
aVfor continuing my crazy crowdsourcing practices,
p242
aVspecifically for asking musicians
p243
aVwho are fans if they wanted to join us on stage
p244
aVfor a few songs in exchange for love and tickets and beer,
p245
aVand this was a doctored image that went up of me on a website.
p246
aVAnd this hurt in a really familiar way.
p247
aVAnd people saying,
p248
aV"You're not allowed anymore to ask for that kind of help,"
p249
aVreally reminded me of the people in their cars yelling, "Get a job."
p250
aVBecause they weren't with us on the sidewalk,
p251
aVand they couldn't see the exchange
p252
aVthat was happening between me and my crowd,
p253
aVan exchange that was very fair to us but alien to them.
p254
aa(lp255
VSo this is slightly not safe for work.
p256
aVThis is my Kickstarter backer party in Berlin.
p257
aVAt the end of the night, I stripped and let everyone draw on me.
p258
aVNow let me tell you, if you want to experience
p259
aVthe visceral feeling of trusting strangers \u2014
p260
aa(lp261
V(Laughter)
p262
aa(lp263
VI recommend this,
p264
aVespecially if those strangers are drunk German people.
p265
aa(lp266
V(Laughter)
p267
aa(lp268
VThis was a ninja master-level fan connection,
p269
aVbecause what I was really saying here was,
p270
aVI trust you this much.
p271
aVShould I?
p272
aVShow me.
p273
aa(lp274
VFor most of human history,
p275
aVmusicians, artists, they've been part of the community.
p276
aVConnectors and openers, not untouchable stars.
p277
aVCelebrity is about a lot of people loving you from a distance,
p278
aVbut the Internet
p279
aVand the content that we're freely able to share on it
p280
aVare taking us back.
p281
aVIt's about a few people loving you up close
p282
aVand about those people being enough.
p283
aVSo a lot of people are confused by the idea
p284
aVof no hard sticker price.
p285
aVThey see it as an unpredictable risk, but the things I've done,
p286
aVthe Kickstarter, the street, the doorbell,
p287
aVI don't see these things as risk.
p288
aVI see them as trust.
p289
aVNow, the online tools
p290
aVto make the exchange as easy and as instinctive as the street,
p291
aVthey're getting there.
p292
aVBut the perfect tools aren't going to help us
p293
aVif we can't face each other
p294
aVand give and receive fearlessly,
p295
aVbut, more important \u2014
p296
aVto ask without shame.
p297
aa(lp298
VMy music career has been spent
p299
aVtrying to encounter people on the Internet the way I could on the box.
p300
aVSo blogging and tweeting not just about my tour dates
p301
aVand my new video but about our work and our art
p302
aVand our fears and our hangovers,
p303
aVour mistakes,
p304
aVand we see each other.
p305
aVAnd I think when we really see each other,
p306
aVwe want to help each other.
p307
aa(lp308
VI think people have been obsessed with the wrong question,
p309
aVwhich is, "How do we make people pay for music?"
p310
aVWhat if we started asking,
p311
aV"How do we let people pay for music?"
p312
aa(lp313
VThank you.
