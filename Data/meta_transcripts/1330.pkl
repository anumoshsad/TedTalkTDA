VDo you know how many choices you make
p4
aVin a typical day?
p5
aVDo you know how many choices you make
p6
aVin typical week?
p7
aVI recently did a survey
p8
aVwith over 2,000 Americans,
p9
aVand the average number of choices
p10
aVthat the typical American reports making
p11
aVis about 70 in a typical day.
p12
aVThere was also recently a study done with CEOs
p13
aVin which they followed CEOs around for a whole week.
p14
aVAnd these scientists simply documented all the various tasks
p15
aVthat these CEOs engaged in
p16
aVand how much time they spent engaging
p17
aVin making decisions related to these tasks.
p18
aVAnd they found that the average CEO
p19
aVengaged in about 139 tasks in a week.
p20
aVEach task was made up of many, many, many sub-choices of course.
p21
aV50 percent of their decisions
p22
aVwere made in nine minutes or less.
p23
aVOnly about 12 percent of the decisions
p24
aVdid they make an hour or more of their time.
p25
aVThink about your own choices.
p26
aVDo you know how many choices
p27
aVmake it into your nine minute category
p28
aVversus your one hour category?
p29
aVHow well do you think you're doing
p30
aVat managing those choices?
p31
aa(lp32
VToday I want to talk
p33
aVabout one of the biggest modern day choosing problems that we have,
p34
aVwhich is the choice overload problem.
p35
aVI want to talk about the problem
p36
aVand some potential solutions.
p37
aVNow as I talk about this problem,
p38
aVI'm going to have some questions for you
p39
aVand I'm going to want to know your answers.
p40
aVSo when I ask you a question,
p41
aVsince I'm blind,
p42
aVonly raise your hand if you want to burn off some calories.
p43
aV(Laughter)
p44
aVOtherwise, when I ask you a question,
p45
aVand if your answer is yes,
p46
aVI'd like you to clap your hands.
p47
aVSo for my first question for you today:
p48
aVAre you guys ready to hear about the choice overload problem?
p49
aV(Applause)
p50
aVThank you.
p51
aa(lp52
VSo when I was a graduate student at Stanford University,
p53
aVI used to go to this very, very upscale grocery store;
p54
aVat least at that time it was truly upscale.
p55
aVIt was a store called Draeger's.
p56
aVNow this store, it was almost like going to an amusement park.
p57
aVThey had 250 different kinds of mustards and vinegars
p58
aVand over 500 different kinds
p59
aVof fruits and vegetables
p60
aVand more than two dozen different kinds of bottled water \u2014
p61
aVand this was during a time when we actually used to drink tap water.
p62
aVI used to love going to this store,
p63
aVbut on one occasion I asked myself,
p64
aVwell how come you never buy anything?
p65
aVHere's their olive oil aisle.
p66
aVThey had over 75 different kinds of olive oil,
p67
aVincluding those that were in a locked case
p68
aVthat came from thousand-year-old olive trees.
p69
aa(lp70
VSo I one day decided to pay a visit to the manager,
p71
aVand I asked the manager,
p72
aV"Is this model of offering people all this choice really working?"
p73
aVAnd he pointed to the busloads of tourists
p74
aVthat would show up everyday,
p75
aVwith cameras ready usually.
p76
aVWe decided to do a little experiment,
p77
aVand we picked jam for our experiment.
p78
aVHere's their jam aisle.
p79
aVThey had 348 different kinds of jam.
p80
aVWe set up a little tasting booth
p81
aVright near the entrance of the store.
p82
aVWe there put out six different flavors of jam
p83
aVor 24 different flavors of jam,
p84
aVand we looked at two things:
p85
aVFirst, in which case
p86
aVwere people more likely to stop, sample some jam?
p87
aVMore people stopped when there were 24, about 60 percent,
p88
aVthan when there were six,
p89
aVabout 40 percent.
p90
aVThe next thing we looked at
p91
aVis in which case were people more likely
p92
aVto buy a jar of jam.
p93
aVNow we see the opposite effect.
p94
aVOf the people who stopped when there were 24,
p95
aVonly three percent of them actually bought a jar of jam.
p96
aVOf the people who stopped when there were six,
p97
aVwell now we saw that 30 percent of them
p98
aVactually bought a jar of jam.
p99
aVNow if you do the math,
p100
aVpeople were at least six times more likely to buy a jar of jam
p101
aVif they encountered six
p102
aVthan if they encountered 24.
p103
aa(lp104
VNow choosing not to buy a jar of jam
p105
aVis probably good for us \u2014
p106
aVat least it's good for our waistlines \u2014
p107
aVbut it turns out that this choice overload problem affects us
p108
aVeven in very consequential decisions.
p109
aVWe choose not to choose,
p110
aVeven when it goes against our best self-interests.
p111
aVSo now for the topic of today: financial savings.
p112
aVNow I'm going to describe to you a study I did
p113
aVwith Gur Huberman, Emir Kamenica, Wei Jang
p114
aVwhere we looked at the retirement savings decisions
p115
aVof nearly a million Americans
p116
aVfrom about 650 plans
p117
aVall in the U.S.
p118
aVAnd what we looked at
p119
aVwas whether the number of fund offerings
p120
aVavailable in a retirement savings plan,
p121
aVthe 401(k) plan,
p122
aVdoes that affect people's likelihood
p123
aVto save more for tomorrow.
p124
aVAnd what we found
p125
aVwas that indeed there was a correlation.
p126
aVSo in these plans, we had about 657 plans
p127
aVthat ranged from offering people
p128
aVanywhere from two to 59 different fund offerings.
p129
aVAnd what we found was that,
p130
aVthe more funds offered,
p131
aVindeed, there was less participation rate.
p132
aa(lp133
VSo if you look at the extremes,
p134
aVthose plans that offered you two funds,
p135
aVparticipation rates were around in the mid-70s \u2014
p136
aVstill not as high as we want it to be.
p137
aVIn those plans that offered nearly 60 funds,
p138
aVparticipation rates have now dropped
p139
aVto about the 60th percentile.
p140
aVNow it turns out
p141
aVthat even if you do choose to participate
p142
aVwhen there are more choices present,
p143
aVeven then, it has negative consequences.
p144
aVSo for those people who did choose to participate,
p145
aVthe more choices available,
p146
aVthe more likely people were
p147
aVto completely avoid stocks or equity funds.
p148
aVThe more choices available,
p149
aVthe more likely they were
p150
aVto put all their money in pure money market accounts.
p151
aVNow neither of these extreme decisions
p152
aVare the kinds of decisions
p153
aVthat any of us would recommend for people
p154
aVwhen you're considering their future financial well-being.
p155
aa(lp156
VWell, over the past decade,
p157
aVwe have observed three main negative consequences
p158
aVto offering people more and more choices.
p159
aVThey're more likely to delay choosing \u2014
p160
aVprocrastinate even when it goes against their best self-interest.
p161
aVThey're more likely to make worse choices \u2014
p162
aVworse financial choices, medical choices.
p163
aVThey're more likely to choose things that make them less satisfied,
p164
aVeven when they do objectively better.
p165
aVThe main reason for this
p166
aVis because, we might enjoy gazing at those giant walls
p167
aVof mayonnaises, mustards, vinegars, jams,
p168
aVbut we can't actually do the math of comparing and contrasting
p169
aVand actually picking from that stunning display.
p170
aVSo what I want to propose to you today
p171
aVare four simple techniques \u2014
p172
aVtechniques that we have tested in one way or another
p173
aVin different research venues \u2014
p174
aVthat you can easily apply
p175
aVin your businesses.
p176
aa(lp177
VThe first: Cut.
p178
aVYou've heard it said before,
p179
aVbut it's never been more true than today,
p180
aVthat less is more.
p181
aVPeople are always upset when I say, "Cut."
p182
aVThey're always worried they're going to lose shelf space.
p183
aVBut in fact, what we're seeing more and more
p184
aVis that if you are willing to cut,
p185
aVget rid of those extraneous redundant options,
p186
aVwell there's an increase in sales,
p187
aVthere's a lowering of costs,
p188
aVthere is an improvement of the choosing experience.
p189
aVWhen Proctor & Gamble
p190
aVwent from 26 different kinds of Head & Shoulders to 15,
p191
aVthey saw an increase in sales by 10 percent.
p192
aVWhen the Golden Cat Corporation
p193
aVgot rid of their 10 worst-selling cat litter products,
p194
aVthey saw an increase in profits
p195
aVby 87 percent \u2014
p196
aVa function of both increase in sales
p197
aVand lowering of costs.
p198
aVYou know, the average grocery store today
p199
aVoffers you 45,000 products.
p200
aVThe typical Walmart today offers you 100,000 products.
p201
aVBut the ninth largest retailer,
p202
aVthe ninth biggest retailer in the world today
p203
aVis Aldi,
p204
aVand it offers you only 1,400 products \u2014
p205
aVone kind of canned tomato sauce.
p206
aa(lp207
VNow in the financial savings world,
p208
aVI think one of the best examples that has recently come out
p209
aVon how to best manage the choice offerings
p210
aVhas actually been something that David Laibson was heavily involved in designing,
p211
aVwhich was the program that they have at Harvard.
p212
aVEvery single Harvard employee
p213
aVis now automatically enrolled
p214
aVin a lifecycle fund.
p215
aVFor those people who actually want to choose,
p216
aVthey're given 20 funds,
p217
aVnot 300 or more funds.
p218
aVYou know, often, people say,
p219
aV"I don't know how to cut.
p220
aVThey're all important choices."
p221
aVAnd the first thing I do is I ask the employees,
p222
aV"Tell me how these choices are different from one another.
p223
aVAnd if your employees can't tell them apart,
p224
aVneither can your consumers."
p225
aa(lp226
VNow before we started our session this afternoon,
p227
aVI had a chat with Gary.
p228
aVAnd Gary said that he would be willing
p229
aVto offer people in this audience
p230
aVan all-expenses-paid free vacation
p231
aVto the most beautiful road in the world.
p232
aVHere's a description of the road.
p233
aVAnd I'd like you to read it.
p234
aVAnd now I'll give you a few seconds to read it
p235
aVand then I want you to clap your hands
p236
aVif you're ready to take Gary up on his offer.
p237
aV(Light clapping)
p238
aVOkay. Anybody who's ready to take him up on his offer.
p239
aVIs that all?
p240
aVAll right, let me show you some more about this.
p241
aV(Laughter)
p242
aVYou guys knew there was a trick, didn't you.
p243
aV(Honk)
p244
aVNow who's ready to go on this trip.
p245
aV(Applause)
p246
aV(Laughter)
p247
aVI think I might have actually heard more hands.
p248
aa(lp249
VAll right.
p250
aVNow in fact,
p251
aVyou had objectively more information
p252
aVthe first time around than the second time around,
p253
aVbut I would venture to guess
p254
aVthat you felt that it was more real the second time around.
p255
aVBecause the pictures made it feel
p256
aVmore real to you.
p257
aVWhich brings me to the second technique
p258
aVfor handling the choice overload problem,
p259
aVwhich is concretization.
p260
aVThat in order for people to understand
p261
aVthe differences between the choices,
p262
aVthey have to be able to understand
p263
aVthe consequences associated with each choice,
p264
aVand that the consequences need to be felt
p265
aVin a vivid sort of way, in a very concrete way.
p266
aVWhy do people spend an average of 15 to 30 percent more
p267
aVwhen they use an ATM card or a credit card
p268
aVas opposed to cash?
p269
aVBecause it doesn't feel like real money.
p270
aVAnd it turns out
p271
aVthat making it feel more concrete
p272
aVcan actually be a very positive tool
p273
aVto use in getting people to save more.
p274
aa(lp275
VSo a study that I did with Shlomo Benartzi
p276
aVand Alessandro Previtero,
p277
aVwe did a study with people at ING \u2014
p278
aVemployees that are all working at ING \u2014
p279
aVand now these people were all in a session
p280
aVwhere they're doing enrollment for their 401(k) plan.
p281
aVAnd during that session,
p282
aVwe kept the session exactly the way it used to be,
p283
aVbut we added one little thing.
p284
aVThe one little thing we added
p285
aVwas we asked people
p286
aVto just think about all the positive things that would happen in your life
p287
aVif you saved more.
p288
aVBy doing that simple thing,
p289
aVthere was an increase in enrollment by 20 percent
p290
aVand there was an increase in the amount of people willing to save
p291
aVor the amount that they were willing to put down into their savings account
p292
aVby four percent.
p293
aa(lp294
VThe third technique: Categorization.
p295
aVWe can handle more categories
p296
aVthan we can handle choices.
p297
aVSo for example,
p298
aVhere's a study we did in a magazine aisle.
p299
aVIt turns out that in Wegmans grocery stores
p300
aVup and down the northeast corridor,
p301
aVthe magazine aisles range anywhere
p302
aVfrom 331 different kinds of magazines
p303
aVall the way up to 664.
p304
aVBut you know what?
p305
aVIf I show you 600 magazines
p306
aVand I divide them up into 10 categories,
p307
aVversus I show you 400 magazines
p308
aVand divide them up into 20 categories,
p309
aVyou believe that I have given you
p310
aVmore choice and a better choosing experience
p311
aVif I gave you the 400
p312
aVthan if I gave you the 600.
p313
aVBecause the categories tell me how to tell them apart.
p314
aa(lp315
VHere are two different jewelry displays.
p316
aVOne is called "Jazz" and the other one is called "Swing."
p317
aVIf you think the display on the left is Swing
p318
aVand the display on the right is Jazz,
p319
aVclap your hands.
p320
aV(Light Clapping)
p321
aVOkay, there's some.
p322
aVIf you think the one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is Swing,
p323
aVclap your hands.
p324
aVOkay, a bit more.
p325
aVNow it turns out you're right.
p326
aVThe one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is Swing,
p327
aVbut you know what?
p328
aVThis is a highly useless categorization scheme.
p329
aV(Laughter)
p330
aVThe categories need to say something
p331
aVto the chooser, not the choice-maker.
p332
aVAnd you often see that problem
p333
aVwhen it comes down to those long lists of all these funds.
p334
aVWho are they actually supposed to be informing?
p335
aa(lp336
VMy fourth technique: Condition for complexity.
p337
aVIt turns out we can actually
p338
aVhandle a lot more information than we think we can,
p339
aVwe've just got to take it a little easier.
p340
aVWe have to gradually increase the complexity.
p341
aVI'm going to show you one example of what I'm talking about.
p342
aVLet's take a very, very complicated decision:
p343
aVbuying a car.
p344
aVHere's a German car manufacturer
p345
aVthat gives you the opportunity to completely custom make your car.
p346
aVYou've got to make 60 different decisions,
p347
aVcompletely make up your car.
p348
aVNow these decisions vary
p349
aVin the number of choices that they offer per decision.
p350
aVCar colors, exterior car colors \u2014
p351
aVI've got 56 choices.
p352
aVEngines, gearshift \u2014 four choices.
p353
aVSo now what I'm going to do
p354
aVis I'm going to vary the order in which these decisions appear.
p355
aVSo half of the customers
p356
aVare going to go from high choice, 56 car colors,
p357
aVto low choice, four gearshifts.
p358
aVThe other half of the customers
p359
aVare going to go from low choice, four gearshifts,
p360
aVto 56 car colors, high choice.
p361
aa(lp362
VWhat am I going to look at?
p363
aVHow engaged you are.
p364
aVIf you keep hitting the default button per decision,
p365
aVthat means you're getting overwhelmed,
p366
aVthat means I'm losing you.
p367
aVWhat you find
p368
aVis the people who go from high choice to low choice,
p369
aVthey're hitting that default button over and over and over again.
p370
aVWe're losing them.
p371
aVThey go from low choice to high choice,
p372
aVthey're hanging in there.
p373
aVIt's the same information. It's the same number of choices.
p374
aVThe only thing that I have done
p375
aVis I have varied the order
p376
aVin which that information is presented.
p377
aVIf I start you off easy,
p378
aVI learn how to choose.
p379
aVEven though choosing gearshift
p380
aVdoesn't tell me anything about my preferences for interior decor,
p381
aVit still prepares me for how to choose.
p382
aVIt also gets me excited about this big product that I'm putting together,
p383
aVso I'm more willing to be motivated
p384
aVto be engaged.
p385
aa(lp386
VSo let me recap.
p387
aVI have talked about four techniques
p388
aVfor mitigating the problem of choice overload \u2014
p389
aVcut \u2014 get rid of the extraneous alternatives;
p390
aVconcretize \u2014 make it real;
p391
aVcategorize \u2014 we can handle more categories, less choices;
p392
aVcondition for complexity.
p393
aVAll of these techniques that I'm describing to you today
p394
aVare designed to help you manage your choices \u2014
p395
aVbetter for you, you can use them on yourself,
p396
aVbetter for the people that you are serving.
p397
aVBecause I believe that the key
p398
aVto getting the most from choice
p399
aVis to be choosy about choosing.
p400
aVAnd the more we're able to be choosy about choosing
p401
aVthe better we will be able
p402
aVto practice the art of choosing.
p403
aa(lp404
