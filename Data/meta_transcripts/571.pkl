VLet me share with you today an original discovery.
p4
aVBut I want to tell it to you the way it really happened \u2014
p5
aVnot the way I present it in a scientific meeting,
p6
aVor the way you'd read it in a scientific paper.
p7
aVIt's a story about beyond biomimetics,
p8
aVto something I'm calling biomutualism.
p9
aVI define that as an association between biology and another discipline,
p10
aVwhere each discipline reciprocally advances the other,
p11
aVbut where the collective discoveries that emerge are beyond any single field.
p12
aVNow, in terms of biomimetics,
p13
aVas human technologies take on more of the characteristics of nature,
p14
aVnature becomes a much more useful teacher.
p15
aVEngineering can be inspired by biology
p16
aVby using its principles and analogies when they're advantageous,
p17
aVbut then integrating that with the best human engineering,
p18
aVultimately to make something actually better than nature.
p19
aa(lp20
VNow, being a biologist, I was very curious about this.
p21
aVThese are gecko toes.
p22
aVAnd we wondered how they use these bizarre toes
p23
aVto climb up a wall so quickly.
p24
aVWe discovered it. And what we found was
p25
aVthat they have leaf-like structures on their toes,
p26
aVwith millions of tiny hairs that look like a rug,
p27
aVand each of those hairs has the worst case of split-ends possible:
p28
aVabout 100 to 1000 split ends that are nano-size.
p29
aVAnd the individual has 2 billion of these nano-size split ends.
p30
aVThey don't stick by Velcro or suction or glue.
p31
aVThey actually stick by intermolecular forces alone,
p32
aVvan der Waals forces.
p33
aVAnd I'm really pleased to report to you today
p34
aVthat the first synthetic self-cleaning, dry adhesive has been made.
p35
aVFrom the simplest version in nature, one branch,
p36
aVmy engineering collaborator, Ron Fearing, at Berkeley,
p37
aVhad made the first synthetic version.
p38
aVAnd so has my other incredible collaborator,
p39
aVMark Cutkosky, at Stanford \u2014
p40
aVhe made much larger hairs than the gecko,
p41
aVbut used the same general principles.
p42
aa(lp43
VAnd here is its first test.
p44
aV(Laughter)
p45
aVThat's Kellar Autumn, my former Ph.D. student,
p46
aVprofessor now at Lewis and Clark,
p47
aVliterally giving his first-born child up for this test.
p48
aV(Laughter)
p49
aa(lp50
VMore recently, this happened.
p51
aa(lp52
VMan: This the first time someone has actually climbed with it.
p53
aa(lp54
VNarrator: Lynn Verinsky, a professional climber,
p55
aVwho appeared to be brimming with confidence.
p56
aa(lp57
VLynn Verinsky: Honestly, it's going to be perfectly safe. It will be perfectly safe.
p58
aa(lp59
VMan: How do you know?
p60
aa(lp61
VLynn Verinsky: Because of liability insurance. (Laughter)
p62
aa(lp63
VNarrator: With a mattress below and attached to a safety rope,
p64
aVLynn began her 60-foot ascent.
p65
aVLynn made it to the top in a perfect pairing
p66
aVof Hollywood and science.
p67
aa(lp68
VMan: So you're the first human being to officially emulate a gecko.
p69
aa(lp70
VLynn Verinsky: Ha! Wow. And what a privilege that has been.
p71
aa(lp72
VRobert Full: That's what she did on rough surfaces.
p73
aVBut she actually used these on smooth surfaces \u2014
p74
aVtwo of them \u2014 to climb up, and pull herself up.
p75
aVAnd you can try this in the lobby,
p76
aVand look at the gecko-inspired material.
p77
aVNow the problem with the robots doing this
p78
aVis that they can't get unstuck,
p79
aVwith the material.
p80
aVThis is the gecko's solution. They actually peel their toes away
p81
aVfrom the surface, at high rates,
p82
aVas they run up the wall.
p83
aa(lp84
VWell I'm really excited today to show you
p85
aVthe newest version of a robot, Stickybot,
p86
aVusing a new hierarchical dry adhesive.
p87
aVHere is the actual robot.
p88
aVAnd here is what it does.
p89
aVAnd if you look,
p90
aVyou can see that it uses
p91
aVthe toe peeling,
p92
aVjust like the gecko does.
p93
aVIf we can show some of the video, you can see it climbing up the wall.
p94
aV(Applause)
p95
aVThere it is.
p96
aVAnd now it can go on other surfaces because of the new adhesive
p97
aVthat the Stanford group was able to do
p98
aVin designing this incredible robot.
p99
aV(Applause)
p100
aa(lp101
VOh. One thing I want to point out is, look at Stickybot.
p102
aVYou see something on it. It's not just to look like a gecko.
p103
aVIt has a tail. And just when you think you've figured out nature,
p104
aVthis kind of thing happens.
p105
aVThe engineers told us, for the climbing robots,
p106
aVthat, if they don't have a tail,
p107
aVthey fall off the wall.
p108
aVSo what they did was they asked us
p109
aVan important question.
p110
aVThey said, "Well, it kind of looks like a tail."
p111
aVEven though we put a passive bar there.
p112
aV"Do animals use their tails when they climb up walls?"
p113
aVWhat they were doing was returning the favor,
p114
aVby giving us a hypothesis to test,
p115
aVin biology, that we wouldn't have thought of.
p116
aa(lp117
VSo of course, in reality, we were then panicked,
p118
aVbeing the biologists, and we should know this already.
p119
aVWe said, "Well, what do tails do?"
p120
aVWell we know that tails store fat, for example.
p121
aVWe know that you can grab onto things with them.
p122
aVAnd perhaps it is most well known
p123
aVthat they provide static balance.
p124
aV(Laughter)
p125
aVIt can also act as a counterbalance.
p126
aVSo watch this kangaroo.
p127
aVSee that tail? That's incredible!
p128
aVMarc Raibert built a Uniroo hopping robot.
p129
aVAnd it was unstable without its tail.
p130
aVNow mostly tails limit maneuverability,
p131
aVlike this human inside this dinosaur suit.
p132
aV(Laughter)
p133
aVMy colleagues actually went on to test this limitation,
p134
aVby increasing the moment of inertia of a student, so they had a tail,
p135
aVand running them through and obstacle course,
p136
aVand found a decrement in performance,
p137
aVlike you'd predict.
p138
aV(Laughter)
p139
aVBut of course, this is a passive tail.
p140
aVAnd you can also have active tails.
p141
aa(lp142
VAnd when I went back to research this, I realized
p143
aVthat one of the great TED moments in the past,
p144
aVfrom Nathan,
p145
aVwe've talked about an active tail.
p146
aa(lp147
VVideo: Myhrvold thinks tail-cracking dinosaurs
p148
aVwere interested in love, not war.
p149
aa(lp150
VRobert Full: He talked about the tail being a whip for communication.
p151
aVIt can also be used in defense.
p152
aVPretty powerful.
p153
aVSo we then went back and looked at the animal.
p154
aVAnd we ran it up a surface.
p155
aVBut this time what we did is we put a slippery patch
p156
aVthat you see in yellow there.
p157
aVAnd watch on the right what the animal is doing with its tail
p158
aVwhen it slips. This is slowed down 10 times.
p159
aVSo here is normal speed.
p160
aVAnd watch it now slip,
p161
aVand see what it does with its tail.
p162
aVIt has an active tail that functions as a fifth leg,
p163
aVand it contributes to stability.
p164
aVIf you make it slip a huge amount, this is what we discovered.
p165
aVThis is incredible.
p166
aVThe engineers had a really good idea.
p167
aa(lp168
VAnd then of course we wondered,
p169
aVokay, they have an active tail, but let's picture them.
p170
aVThey're climbing up a wall, or a tree.
p171
aVAnd they get to the top and let's say there's some leaves there.
p172
aVAnd what would happen if they climbed on the underside of that leaf,
p173
aVand there was some wind, or we shook it?
p174
aVAnd we did that experiment, that you see here.
p175
aV(Applause)
p176
aVAnd this is what we discovered.
p177
aVNow that's real time. You can't see anything.
p178
aVBut there it is slowed down.
p179
aa(lp180
VWhat we discovered was the world's fastest air-righting response.
p181
aVFor those of you who remember your physics, that's a zero-angular-momentum
p182
aVrighting response. But it's like a cat.
p183
aVYou know, cats falling. Cats do this. They twist their bodies.
p184
aVBut geckos do it better.
p185
aVAnd they do it with their tail.
p186
aVSo they do it with this active tail as they swing around.
p187
aVAnd then they always land in the sort of superman skydiving posture.
p188
aVOkay, now we wondered, if we were right,
p189
aVwe should be able to test this in a physical model, in a robot.
p190
aa(lp191
VSo for TED we actually built a robot,
p192
aVover there, a prototype, with the tail.
p193
aVAnd we're going to attempt the first air-righting response
p194
aVin a tail, with a robot.
p195
aVIf we could have the lights on it.
p196
aVOkay, there it goes.
p197
aVAnd show the video.
p198
aVThere it is.
p199
aVAnd it works just like it does in the animal.
p200
aVSo all you need is a swing of the tail to right yourself.
p201
aV(Applause)
p202
aa(lp203
VNow, of course, we were normally frightened
p204
aVbecause the animal has no gliding adaptations,
p205
aVso we thought, "Oh that's okay. We'll put it in a vertical wind tunnel.
p206
aVWe'll blow the air up, we'll give it a landing target, a tree trunk,
p207
aVjust outside the plexi-glass enclosure, and see what it does.
p208
aV(Laughter)
p209
aVSo we did. And here is what it does.
p210
aVSo the wind is coming from the bottom. This is slowed down 10 times.
p211
aVIt does an equilibrium glide. Highly controlled.
p212
aVThis is sort of incredible. But actually it's quite beautiful,
p213
aVwhen you take a picture of it.
p214
aVAnd it's better than that, it \u2014 just in the slide \u2014 maneuvers in mid-air.
p215
aVAnd the way it does it, is it takes its tail
p216
aVand it swings it one way to yaw left, and it swings its other way to yaw right.
p217
aVSo we can maneuver this way.
p218
aVAnd then \u2014 we had to film this several times to believe this \u2014
p219
aVit also does this. Watch this.
p220
aVIt oscillates its tail up and down like a dolphin.
p221
aVIt can actually swim through the air.
p222
aVBut watch its front legs. Can you see what they are doing?
p223
aVWhat does that mean for the origin of flapping flight?
p224
aVMaybe it's evolved from coming down from trees,
p225
aVand trying to control a glide.
p226
aVStay tuned for that.
p227
aV(Laughter)
p228
aa(lp229
VSo then we wondered, "Can they actually maneuver with this?"
p230
aVSo there is the landing target. Could they steer towards it
p231
aVwith these capabilities? Here it is in the wind tunnel.
p232
aVAnd it certainly looks like it.
p233
aVYou can see it even better from down on top.
p234
aVWatch the animal.
p235
aVDefinitely moving towards the landing target.
p236
aVWatch the whip of its tail as it does it. Look at that.
p237
aVIt's unbelievable.
p238
aa(lp239
VSo now we were really confused,
p240
aVbecause there are no reports of it gliding.
p241
aVSo we went, "Oh my god, we have to go to the field,
p242
aVand see if it actually does this."
p243
aVCompletely opposite of the way you'd see it on a nature film, of course.
p244
aVWe wondered, "Do they actually glide in nature?"
p245
aVWell we went to the forests of Singapore and Southeast Asia.
p246
aVAnd the next video you see is the first time we've showed this.
p247
aa(lp248
VThis is the actual video \u2014 not staged, a real research video \u2014
p249
aVof animal gliding down. There is a red trajectory line.
p250
aVLook at the end to see the animal.
p251
aVBut then as it gets closer to the tree,
p252
aVlook at the close-up. And see if you can see it land.
p253
aVSo there it comes down. There is a gecko at the end of that trajectory line.
p254
aVYou see it there? There? Watch it come down.
p255
aVNow watch up there and you can see the landing. Did you see it hit?
p256
aVIt actually uses its tail too,
p257
aVjust like we saw in the lab.
p258
aa(lp259
VSo now we can continue this mutualism
p260
aVby suggesting that they can make an active tail.
p261
aVAnd here is the first active tail, in the robot,
p262
aVmade by Boston Dynamics.
p263
aVSo to conclude, I think we need to build biomutualisms, like I showed,
p264
aVthat will increase the pace of basic discovery in their application.
p265
aVTo do this though, we need to redesign education in a major way,
p266
aVto balance depth with interdisciplinary communication,
p267
aVand explicitly train people how to contribute to, and benefit from other disciplines.
p268
aVAnd of course you need the organisms and the environment to do it.
p269
aVThat is, whether you care about security, search and rescue or health,
p270
aVwe must preserve nature's designs,
p271
aVotherwise these secrets will be lost forever.
p272
aVAnd from what I heard from our new president,
p273
aVI'm very optimistic. Thank you.
