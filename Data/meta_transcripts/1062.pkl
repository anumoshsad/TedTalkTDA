VMy story actually began when I was four years old
p4
aVand my family moved to a new neighborhood
p5
aVin our hometown of Savannah, Georgia.
p6
aVAnd this was the 1960s
p7
aVwhen actually all the streets in this neighborhood
p8
aVwere named after Confederate war generals.
p9
aVWe lived on Robert E. Lee Boulevard.
p10
aVAnd when I was five,
p11
aVmy parents gave me an orange Schwinn Sting-Ray bicycle.
p12
aVIt had a swooping banana seat and those ape hanger handlebars
p13
aVthat made the rider look like an orangutan.
p14
aVThat's why they were called ape hangers.
p15
aVThey were actually modeled on hotrod motorcycles of the 1960s,
p16
aVwhich I'm sure my mom didn't know.
p17
aVAnd one day I was exploring this cul-de-sac
p18
aVhidden away a few streets away.
p19
aVAnd I came back,
p20
aVand I wanted to turn around and get back to that street more quickly,
p21
aVso I decided to turn around in this big street
p22
aVthat intersected our neighborhood,
p23
aVand wham! I was hit by a passing sedan.
p24
aVMy mangled body flew in one direction,
p25
aVmy mangled bike flew in the other.
p26
aVAnd I lay on the pavement stretching over that yellow line,
p27
aVand one of my neighbors came running over.
p28
aV"Andy, Andy, how are you doing?" she said, using the name of my older brother.
p29
aV(Laughter)
p30
aV"I'm Bruce," I said, and promptly passed out.
p31
aa(lp32
VI broke my left femur that day \u2014
p33
aVit's the largest bone in your body \u2014
p34
aVand spent the next two months in a body cast
p35
aVthat went from my chin to the tip of my toe
p36
aVto my right knee,
p37
aVand a steel bar went from my right knee
p38
aVto my left ankle.
p39
aVAnd for the next 38 years,
p40
aVthat accident was the only medically interesting thing
p41
aVthat ever happened to me.
p42
aVIn fact, I made a living by walking.
p43
aVI traveled around the world, entered different cultures,
p44
aVwrote a series of books about my travels,
p45
aVincluding "Walking the Bible."
p46
aVI hosted a television show by that name
p47
aVon PBS.
p48
aVI was, for all the world, the "walking guy."
p49
aVUntil, in May 2008,
p50
aVa routine visit to my doctor
p51
aVand a routine blood test
p52
aVproduced evidence in the form of an alkaline phosphatase number
p53
aVthat something might be wrong with my bones.
p54
aVAnd my doctor, on a whim, sent me to get a full-body bone scan,
p55
aVwhich showed that there was some growth in my left leg.
p56
aVThat sent me to an X-ray, then to an MRI.
p57
aVAnd one afternoon, I got a call from my doctor.
p58
aV"The tumor in your leg
p59
aVis not consistent with a benign tumor."
p60
aVI stopped walking,
p61
aVand it took my mind a second to convert that double negative
p62
aVinto a much more horrifying negative.
p63
aVI have cancer.
p64
aVAnd to think that the tumor was in the same bone,
p65
aVin the same place in my body
p66
aVas the accident 38 years earlier \u2014
p67
aVit seemed like too much of a coincidence.
p68
aa(lp69
VSo that afternoon, I went back to my house,
p70
aVand my three year-old identical twin daughters, Eden and Tybee Feiler,
p71
aVcame running to meet me.
p72
aVThey'd just turned three,
p73
aVand they were into all things pink and purple.
p74
aVIn fact, we called them Pinkalicious and Purplicious \u2014
p75
aValthough I must say, our favorite nickname
p76
aVoccurred on their birthday, April 15th.
p77
aVWhen they were born at 6:14 and 6:46
p78
aVon April 15, 2005,
p79
aVour otherwise grim, humorless doctor looked at his watch,
p80
aVand was like, "Hmm, April 15th \u2014 tax day.
p81
aVEarly filer and late filer."
p82
aV(Laughter)
p83
aVThe next day I came to see him. I was like, "Doctor, that was a really good joke."
p84
aVAnd he was like, "You're the writer, kid."
p85
aVAnyway \u2014 so they had just turned three,
p86
aVand they came and they were doing this dance they had just made up
p87
aVwhere they were twirling faster and faster until they tumbled to the ground,
p88
aVlaughing with all the glee in the world.
p89
aVI crumbled.
p90
aVI kept imagining all the walks I might not take with them,
p91
aVthe art projects I might not mess up,
p92
aVthe boyfriends I might not scowl at,
p93
aVthe aisles I might not walk down.
p94
aVWould they wonder who I was, I thought.
p95
aVWould they yearn for my approval,
p96
aVmy love, my voice?
p97
aa(lp98
VA few days later, I woke with an idea
p99
aVof how I might give them that voice.
p100
aVI would reach out to six men
p101
aVfrom all parts of my life
p102
aVand ask them to be present
p103
aVin the passages of my daughters' lives.
p104
aV"I believe my girls will have plenty of opportunities in their lives,"
p105
aVI wrote these men.
p106
aV"They'll have loving families and welcoming homes,
p107
aVbut they may not have me.
p108
aVThey may not have their dad.
p109
aVWill you help be their dad?"
p110
aVAnd I said to myself
p111
aVI would call this group of men "the Council of Dads."
p112
aa(lp113
VNow as soon as I had this idea,
p114
aVI decided I wouldn't tell my wife. Okay.
p115
aVShe's a very upbeat,
p116
aVnaturally excited person.
p117
aVThere's this idea in this culture \u2014 I don't have to tell you \u2014
p118
aVthat you sort of "happy" your way through a problem.
p119
aVWe should focus on the positive.
p120
aVMy wife, as I said, she grew up outside of Boston.
p121
aVShe's got a big smile. She's got a big personality.
p122
aVShe's got big hair \u2014
p123
aValthough, she told me recently, I can't say she has big hair,
p124
aVbecause if I say she has big hair,
p125
aVpeople will think she's from Texas.
p126
aVAnd it's apparently okay to marry a boy from Georgia,
p127
aVbut not to have hair from Texas.
p128
aVAnd actually, in her defense, if she were here right now,
p129
aVshe would point out that, when we got married in Georgia,
p130
aVthere were three questions
p131
aVon the marriage certificate license,
p132
aVthe third of which was, "Are you related?"
p133
aV(Laughter)
p134
aVI said, "Look, in Georgia at least we want to know.
p135
aVIn Arkansas they don't even ask."
p136
aVWhat I didn't tell her is, if she said, "Yes," you could jump.
p137
aVYou don't need the 30-day waiting period.
p138
aVBecause you don't need the get-to-know-you session at that point.
p139
aa(lp140
VSo I wasn't going to tell her about this idea,
p141
aVbut the next day I couldn't control myself, I told her.
p142
aVAnd she loved the idea,
p143
aVbut she quickly started rejecting my nominees.
p144
aVShe was like, "Well, I love him, but I would never ask him for advice."
p145
aVSo it turned out that starting a council of dads
p146
aVwas a very efficient way to find out
p147
aVwhat my wife really thought of my friends.
p148
aa(lp149
V(Laughter)
p150
aa(lp151
VSo we decided that we needed a set of rules,
p152
aVand we came up with a number.
p153
aVAnd the first one was no family, only friends.
p154
aVWe thought our family would already be there.
p155
aVSecond, men only.
p156
aVWe were trying to fill the dad-space in the girls' lives.
p157
aVAnd then third, sort of a dad for every side.
p158
aVWe kind of went through my personality
p159
aVand tried to get a dad who represented each different thing.
p160
aVSo what happened was I wrote a letter to each of these men.
p161
aVAnd rather than send it,
p162
aVI decided to read it to them in person.
p163
aVLinda, my wife, joked that it was like having six different marriage proposals.
p164
aVI sort of friend-married each of these guys.
p165
aa(lp166
VAnd the first of these guys was Jeff Schumlin.
p167
aVNow Jeff led this trip I took to Europe
p168
aVwhen I graduated from high school in the early 1980s.
p169
aVAnd on that first day we were in this youth hostel in a castle.
p170
aVAnd I snuck out behind,
p171
aVand there was a moat, a fence and a field of cows.
p172
aVAnd Jeff came up beside me and said,
p173
aV"So, have you ever been cow tipping?"
p174
aVI was like, "Cow tipping?
p175
aVHe was like, "Yeah. Cows sleep standing up.
p176
aVSo if you approach them from behind, down wind,
p177
aVyou can push them over and they go thud in the mud."
p178
aVSo before I had a chance to determine whether this was right or not,
p179
aVwe had jumped the moat, we had climbed the fence,
p180
aVwe were tiptoeing through the dung
p181
aVand approaching some poor, dozing cow.
p182
aa(lp183
VSo a few weeks after my diagnosis,
p184
aVwe went up to Vermont,
p185
aVand I decided to put Jeff as the first person in the Council of Dads.
p186
aVAnd we went to this apple orchard, and I read him this letter.
p187
aV"Will you help be their dad?"
p188
aVAnd I got to the end \u2014 he was crying and I was crying \u2014
p189
aVand then he looked at me, and he said, "Yes."
p190
aVI was like, "Yes?"
p191
aVI kind of had forgotten there was a question at the heart of my letter.
p192
aVAnd frankly, although I keep getting asked this,
p193
aVit never occurred to me that anybody would turn me down
p194
aVunder the circumstances.
p195
aVAnd then I asked him a question, which I ended up asking to all the dads
p196
aVand ended up really encouraging me to write this story down in a book.
p197
aVAnd that was, "What's the one piece of advice
p198
aVyou would give to my girls?"
p199
aa(lp200
VAnd Jeff's advice was,
p201
aV"Be a traveller, not a tourist.
p202
aVGet off the bus. Seek out what's different.
p203
aVApproach the cow."
p204
aV"So it's 10 years from now," I said,
p205
aV"and my daughters are about to take their first trip abroad, and I'm not here.
p206
aVWhat would you tell them?"
p207
aVHe said, "I would approach this journey
p208
aVas a young child might approach a mud puddle.
p209
aVYou can bend over and look at your reflection in the mirror
p210
aVand maybe run your finger and make a small ripple,
p211
aVor you can jump in and thrash around
p212
aVand see what it feels like, what it smells like."
p213
aVAnd as he talked he had that glint in his eye
p214
aVthat I first saw back in Holland \u2014
p215
aVthe glint that says, "Let's go cow tipping,"
p216
aVeven though we never did tip the cow,
p217
aVeven though no one tips the cow,
p218
aVeven though cows don't sleep standing up.
p219
aVHe said, "I want to see you back here girls, at the end of this experience,
p220
aVcovered in mud."
p221
aa(lp222
VTwo weeks after my diagnosis, a biopsy confirmed
p223
aVI had a seven-inch osteosarcoma
p224
aVin my left femur.
p225
aVSix hundred Americans a year get an osteosarcoma.
p226
aVEighty-five percent are under 21.
p227
aVOnly a hundred adults a year
p228
aVget one of these diseases.
p229
aVTwenty years ago, doctors would have cut off my leg and hoped,
p230
aVand there was a 15 percent survival rate.
p231
aVAnd then in the 1980's, they determined
p232
aVthat one particular cocktail of chemo could be effective,
p233
aVand within weeks I had started that regimen.
p234
aVAnd since we are in a medical room,
p235
aVI went through four and a half months of chemo.
p236
aVActually I had Cisplatin, Doxorubicin
p237
aVand very high-dose Methotrexate.
p238
aa(lp239
VAnd then I had a 15-hour surgery
p240
aVin which my surgeon, Dr. John Healey
p241
aVat Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital in New York,
p242
aVtook out my left femur
p243
aVand replaced it with titanium.
p244
aVAnd if you did see the Sanjay special,
p245
aVyou saw these enormous screws
p246
aVthat they screwed into my pelvis.
p247
aVThen he took my fibula from my calf,
p248
aVcut it out and then relocated it to my thigh,
p249
aVwhere it now lives.
p250
aVAnd what he actually did was he de-vascularized it from my calf
p251
aVand re-vascularized it in my thigh
p252
aVand then connected it
p253
aVto the good parts of my knee and my hip.
p254
aVAnd then he took out a third of my quadriceps muscle.
p255
aVThis is a surgery so rare
p256
aVonly two human beings have survived it before me.
p257
aVAnd my reward for surviving it
p258
aVwas to go back for four more months of chemo.
p259
aVIt was, as we said in my house,
p260
aVa lost year.
p261
aa(lp262
VBecause in those opening weeks, we all had nightmares.
p263
aVAnd one night I had a nightmare that I was walking through my house,
p264
aVsat at my desk and saw photographs of someone else's children
p265
aVsitting on my desk.
p266
aVAnd I remember a particular one night that, when you told that story of \u2014
p267
aVI don't know where you are Dr. Nuland \u2014
p268
aVof William Sloane Coffin \u2014
p269
aVit made me think of it.
p270
aVBecause I was in the hospital after, I think it was my fourth round of chemo
p271
aVwhen my numbers went to zero, and I had basically no immune system.
p272
aVAnd they put me in an infectious disease ward at the hospital.
p273
aVAnd anybody who came to see me had to cover themselves in a mask
p274
aVand cover all of the extraneous parts of their body.
p275
aVAnd one night I got a call from my mother-in-law
p276
aVthat my daughters, at that time three and a half,
p277
aVwere missing me and feeling my absence.
p278
aVAnd I hung up the phone,
p279
aVand I put my face in my hands,
p280
aVand I screamed this silent scream.
p281
aVAnd what you said, Dr. Nuland \u2014 I don't know where you are \u2014
p282
aVmade me think of this today.
p283
aVBecause the thought that came to my mind
p284
aVwas that the feeling that I had
p285
aVwas like a primal scream.
p286
aa(lp287
VAnd what was so striking \u2014
p288
aVand one of the messages I want to leave you here with today \u2014
p289
aVis the experience.
p290
aVAs I became less and less human \u2014
p291
aVand at this moment in my life, I was probably 30 pounds less than I am right now.
p292
aVOf course, I had no hair and no immune system.
p293
aVThey were actually putting blood inside my body.
p294
aVAt that moment I was less and less human,
p295
aVI was also, at the same time,
p296
aVmaybe the most human I've ever been.
p297
aVAnd what was so striking about that time
p298
aVwas, instead of repulsing people,
p299
aVI was actually proving to be a magnet for people.
p300
aVPeople were incredibly drawn.
p301
aVWhen my wife and I had kids, we thought it would be all-hands-on-deck.
p302
aVInstead, it was everybody running the other way.
p303
aVAnd when I had cancer, we thought it'd be everybody running the other way.
p304
aVInstead, it was all-hands-on-deck.
p305
aVAnd when people came to me,
p306
aVrather than being incredibly turned off by what they saw \u2014
p307
aVI was like a living ghost \u2014
p308
aVthey were incredibly moved
p309
aVto talk about what was going on in their own lives.
p310
aa(lp311
VCancer, I found, is a passport to intimacy.
p312
aVIt is an invitation, maybe even a mandate,
p313
aVto enter the most vital arenas of human life,
p314
aVthe most sensitive and the most frightening,
p315
aVthe ones that we never want to go to,
p316
aVbut when we do go there,
p317
aVwe feel incredibly transformed when we do.
p318
aVAnd this also happened to my girls as they began to see,
p319
aVand, we thought, maybe became an ounce more compassionate.
p320
aVOne day, my daughter Tybee,
p321
aVTybee came to me, and she said, "I have so much love for you in my body, daddy,
p322
aVI can't stop giving you hugs and kisses.
p323
aVAnd when I have no more love left, I just drink milk,
p324
aVbecause that's where love comes from."
p325
aV(Laughter)
p326
aVAnd one night my daughter Eden came to me.
p327
aVAnd as I lifted my leg out of bed,
p328
aVshe reached for my crutches and handed them to me.
p329
aVIn fact, if I cling to one memory of this year,
p330
aVit would be walking down a darkened hallway
p331
aVwith five spongy fingers
p332
aVgrasping the handle underneath my hand.
p333
aVI didn't need the crutch anymore,
p334
aVI was walking on air.
p335
aa(lp336
VAnd one of the profound things that happened
p337
aVwas this act of actually connecting to all these people.
p338
aVAnd it made me think \u2014 and I'll just note for the record \u2014
p339
aVone word that I've only heard once actually
p340
aVwas when we were all doing Tony Robbins yoga yesterday \u2014
p341
aVthe one word that has not been mentioned in this seminar actually
p342
aVis the word "friend."
p343
aVAnd yet from everything we've been talking about \u2014
p344
aVcompliance, or addiction, or weight loss \u2014
p345
aVwe now know that community is important,
p346
aVand yet it's one thing we don't actually bring in.
p347
aVAnd there was something incredibly profound
p348
aVabout sitting down with my closest friends
p349
aVand telling them what they meant to me.
p350
aVAnd one of the things that I learned is that over time,
p351
aVparticularly men, who used to be non-communicative,
p352
aVare becoming more and more communicative.
p353
aVAnd that particularly happened \u2014 there was one in my life \u2014
p354
aVis this Council of Dads
p355
aVthat Linda said, what we were talking about,
p356
aVit's like what the moms talk about at school drop-off.
p357
aa(lp358
VAnd no one captures this modern manhood to me
p359
aVmore than David Black.
p360
aVNow David is my literary agent.
p361
aVHe's about five-foot three and a half on a good day,
p362
aVstanding fully upright in cowboy boots.
p363
aVAnd on kind of the manly-male front, he answers the phone \u2014
p364
aVI can say this I guess because you've done it here \u2014
p365
aVhe answers the phone, "Yo, motherfucker."
p366
aVHe gives boring speeches about obscure bottles of wine,
p367
aVand on his 50th birthday he bought a convertible sports car \u2014
p368
aValthough, like a lot of men, he's impatient; he bought it on his 49th.
p369
aVBut like a lot of modern men, he hugs, he bakes,
p370
aVhe leaves work early to coach Little League.
p371
aVSomeone asked me if he cried when I asked him to be in the council of dads.
p372
aVI was like, "David cries when you invite him to take a walk."
p373
aV(Laughter)
p374
aVBut he's a literary agent,
p375
aVwhich means he's a broker of dreams in a world where most dreams don't come true.
p376
aVAnd this is what we wanted him to capture \u2014
p377
aVwhat it means to have setbacks and then aspirations.
p378
aVAnd I said, "What's the most valuable thing you can give to a dreamer?"
p379
aVAnd he said, "A belief in themselves."
p380
aV"But when I came to see you," I said, "I didn't believe in myself.
p381
aVI was at a wall."
p382
aVHe said, "I don't see the wall," and I'm telling you the same,
p383
aVDon't see the wall.
p384
aVYou may encounter one from time to time,
p385
aVbut you've got to find a way to get over it, around it, or through it.
p386
aVBut whatever you do, don't succumb to it.
p387
aVDon't give in to the wall.
p388
aa(lp389
VMy home is not far from the Brooklyn Bridge,
p390
aVand during the year and a half I was on crutches,
p391
aVit became a sort of symbol to me.
p392
aVSo one day near the end of my journey,
p393
aVI said, "Come on girls, let's take a walk across the Brooklyn Bridge."
p394
aVWe set out on crutches.
p395
aVI was on crutches, my wife was next to me,
p396
aVmy girls were doing these rockstar poses up ahead.
p397
aVAnd because walking was one of the first things I lost,
p398
aVI spent most of that year
p399
aVthinking about this most elemental of human acts.
p400
aVWalking upright, we are told,
p401
aVis the threshold of what made us human.
p402
aVAnd yet, for the four million years humans have been walking upright,
p403
aVthe act is essentially unchanged.
p404
aVAs my physical therapist likes to say,
p405
aV"Every step is a tragedy waiting to happen."
p406
aVYou nearly fall with one leg,
p407
aVthen you catch yourself with the other.
p408
aVAnd the biggest consequence of walking on crutches \u2014
p409
aVas I did for a year and a half \u2014
p410
aVis that you walk slower.
p411
aVYou hurry,
p412
aVyou get where you're going, but you get there alone.
p413
aVYou go slow, you get where you're going,
p414
aVbut you get there with this community
p415
aVyou built along the way.
p416
aa(lp417
VAt the risk of admission, I was never nicer
p418
aVthan the year I was on crutches.
p419
aV200 years ago,
p420
aVa new type of pedestrian appeared in Paris.
p421
aVHe was called a "flaneur," one who wanders the arcades.
p422
aVAnd it was the custom of those flaneurs
p423
aVto show they were men of leisure
p424
aVby taking turtles for walks
p425
aVand letting the reptile set the pace.
p426
aVAnd I just love this ode to slow moving.
p427
aVAnd it's become my own motto for my girls.
p428
aVTake a walk with a turtle.
p429
aVBehold the world in pause.
p430
aVAnd this idea of pausing
p431
aVmay be the single biggest lesson I took from my journey.
p432
aa(lp433
VThere's a quote from Moses
p434
aVon the side of the Liberty Bell,
p435
aVand it comes from a passage in the book of Leviticus,
p436
aVthat every seven years you should let the land lay fallow.
p437
aVAnd every seven sets of seven years,
p438
aVthe land gets an extra year of rest
p439
aVduring which time all families are reunited
p440
aVand people surrounded with the ones they love.
p441
aVThat 50th year is called the jubilee year,
p442
aVand it's the origin of that term.
p443
aVAnd though I'm shy of 50,
p444
aVit captures my own experience.
p445
aVMy lost year was my jubilee year.
p446
aVBy laying fallow,
p447
aVI planted the seeds for a healthier future
p448
aVand was reunited with the ones I love.
p449
aa(lp450
VCome the one year anniversary of my journey,
p451
aVI went to see my surgeon, Dr. John Healey \u2014
p452
aVand by the way, Healey, great name for a doctor.
p453
aVHe's the president of the International Society of Limb Salvage,
p454
aVwhich is the least euphemistic term I've ever heard.
p455
aVAnd I said, "Dr. Healey, if my daughters come to you one day
p456
aVand say, 'What should I learn from my daddy's story?'
p457
aVwhat would you tell them?"
p458
aVHe said, "I would tell them what I know,
p459
aVand that is everybody dies,
p460
aVbut not everybody lives.
p461
aVI want you to live."
p462
aa(lp463
VI wrote a letter to my girls
p464
aVthat appears at the end of my book, "The Council of Dads,"
p465
aVand I listed these lessons,
p466
aVa few of which you've heard here today:
p467
aVApproach the cow, pack your flipflops,
p468
aVdon't see the wall,
p469
aVlive the questions,
p470
aVharvest miracles.
p471
aVAs I looked at this list \u2014 to me it was sort of like a psalm book of living \u2014
p472
aVI realized, we may have done it for our girls,
p473
aVbut it really changed us.
p474
aVAnd that is, the secret of the Council of Dads,
p475
aVis that my wife and I did this
p476
aVin an attempt to help our daughters,
p477
aVbut it really changed us.
p478
aa(lp479
VSo I stand here today
p480
aVas you see now, walking without crutches or a cane.
p481
aVAnd last week I had my 18-month scans.
p482
aVAnd as you all know,
p483
aVanybody with cancer has to get follow-up scans.
p484
aVIn my case it's quarterly.
p485
aVAnd all the collective minds in this room, I dare say,
p486
aVcan never find a solution for scan-xiety.
p487
aVAs I was going there, I was wondering, what would I say
p488
aVdepending on what happened here.
p489
aVI got good news that day,
p490
aVand I stand here today cancer-free,
p491
aVwalking without aid
p492
aVand hobbling forward.
p493
aa(lp494
VAnd I just want to mention briefly in passing \u2014 I'm past my time limit \u2014
p495
aVbut I just want to briefly mention in passing
p496
aVthat one of the nice things that can come out of a conference like this
p497
aVis, at a similar meeting,
p498
aVback in the spring,
p499
aVAnne Wojcicki heard about our story
p500
aVand very quickly \u2014 in a span of three weeks \u2014
p501
aVput the full resources of 23andMe,
p502
aVand we announced an initiative in July
p503
aVto get to decode the genome
p504
aVof anybody, a living person
p505
aVwith a heart tissue, bone sarcoma.
p506
aVAnd she told me last night, in the three months since we've done it,
p507
aVwe've gotten 300 people who've contributed to this program.
p508
aVAnd the epidemiologists here will tell you,
p509
aVthat's half the number of people who get the disease
p510
aVin one year in the United States.
p511
aVSo if you go to 23andMe,
p512
aVor if you go to councilofdads.com, you can click on a link.
p513
aVAnd we encourage anybody to join this effort.
p514
aa(lp515
VBut I'll just close what I've been talking about
p516
aVby leaving you with this message:
p517
aVMay you find an excuse to reach out to some long-lost pal,
p518
aVor to that college roommate,
p519
aVor to some person you may have turned away from.
p520
aVMay you find a mud puddle to jump in someplace,
p521
aVor find a way to get over, around, or through any wall
p522
aVthat stands between you and one of your dreams.
p523
aVAnd every now and then,
p524
aVfind a friend, find a turtle,
p525
aVand take a long, slow walk.
p526
aa(lp527
VThank you very much.
