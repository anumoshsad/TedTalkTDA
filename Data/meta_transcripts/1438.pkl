VFour years ago today, exactly, actually,
p4
aVI started a fashion blog called Style Rookie.
p5
aVLast September of 2011, I started an online magazine
p6
aVfor teenage girls called Rookiemag.com.
p7
aVMy name's Tavi Gevinson, and
p8
aVthe title of my talk is "Still Figuring It Out,"
p9
aVand the MS Paint quality of my slides
p10
aVwas a total creative decision in keeping with today's theme,
p11
aVand has nothing to do with my inability
p12
aVto use PowerPoint. (Laughter)
p13
aa(lp14
VSo I edit this site for teenage girls. I'm a feminist.
p15
aVI am kind of a pop culture nerd, and I think a lot about
p16
aVwhat makes a strong female character,
p17
aVand, you know, movies and TV shows,
p18
aVthese things have influence. My own website.
p19
aVSo I think the question of what makes a strong female
p20
aVcharacter often goes misinterpreted,
p21
aVand instead we get these two-dimensional superwomen
p22
aVwho maybe have one quality that's played up a lot,
p23
aVlike a Catwoman type,
p24
aVor she plays her sexuality up a lot,
p25
aVand it's seen as power.
p26
aVBut they're not strong characters who happen to be female.
p27
aVThey're completely flat,
p28
aVand they're basically cardboard characters.
p29
aVThe problem with this is that then
p30
aVpeople expect women to be that easy to understand,
p31
aVand women are mad at themselves
p32
aVfor not being that simple,
p33
aVwhen, in actuality, women are complicated,
p34
aVwomen are multifaceted \u2014 not because women are crazy,
p35
aVbut because people are crazy,
p36
aVand women happen to be people. (Laughter)
p37
aa(lp38
VSo the flaws are the key.
p39
aVI'm not the first person to say this.
p40
aVWhat makes a strong female character
p41
aVis a character who has weaknesses, who has flaws,
p42
aVwho is maybe not immediately likable,
p43
aVbut eventually relatable.
p44
aa(lp45
VI don't like to acknowledge a problem
p46
aVwithout also acknowledging those who work to fix it,
p47
aVso just wanted to acknowledge shows like "Mad Men,"
p48
aVmovies like "Bridesmaids," whose female characters
p49
aVor protagonists are complex, multifaceted.
p50
aVLena Dunham, who's on here, her show on HBO
p51
aVthat premiers next month, "Girls,"
p52
aVshe said she wanted to start it because she felt that
p53
aVevery woman she knew was just a bundle of contradictions,
p54
aVand that feels accurate for all people,
p55
aVbut you don't see women represented like that as much.
p56
aVCongrats, guys. (Laughs)
p57
aa(lp58
VBut I don't feel that \u2014 I still feel that there are some types
p59
aVof women who are not represented that way,
p60
aVand one group that we'll focus on today are teens,
p61
aVbecause I think teenagers are especially contradictory
p62
aVand still figuring it out,
p63
aVand in the '90s there was "Freaks and Geeks"
p64
aVand "My So-Called Life," and their characters,
p65
aVLindsay Weir and Angela Chase,
p66
aVI mean, the whole premise of the shows
p67
aVwere just them trying to figure themselves out, basically,
p68
aVbut those shows only lasted a season each,
p69
aVand I haven't really seen anything like that on TV since.
p70
aa(lp71
VSo this is a scientific diagram of my brain \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p72
aVaround the time when I was,
p73
aVwhen I started watching those TV shows.
p74
aVI was ending middle school, starting high school \u2014
p75
aVI'm a sophomore now \u2014
p76
aVand I was trying to reconcile
p77
aVall of these differences that you're told you can't be
p78
aVwhen you're growing up as a girl.
p79
aVYou can't be smart and pretty.
p80
aVYou can't be a feminist who's also interested in fashion.
p81
aVYou can't care about clothes if it's not for the sake
p82
aVof what other people, usually men, will think of you.
p83
aa(lp84
VSo I was trying to figure all that out,
p85
aVand I felt a little confused,
p86
aVand I said so on my blog,
p87
aVand I said that I wanted to start
p88
aVa website for teenage girls
p89
aVthat was not this kind of one-dimensional
p90
aVstrong character empowerment thing
p91
aVbecause I think one thing that can be very alienating
p92
aVabout a misconception of feminism is that
p93
aVgirls then think that to be a feminist, they have to live up to
p94
aVbeing perfectly consistent in your beliefs,
p95
aVnever being insecure, never having doubts,
p96
aVhaving all of the answers. And this is not true,
p97
aVand, actually, reconciling all the contradictions I was feeling
p98
aVbecame easier once I understood that feminism
p99
aVwas not a rulebook but a discussion,
p100
aVa conversation, a process,
p101
aVand this is a spread from a zine that I made last year
p102
aVwhen I \u2014 I mean, I think I've let myself go a bit
p103
aVon the illustration front since.
p104
aVBut, yeah.
p105
aa(lp106
VSo I said on my blog that I wanted to start this publication
p107
aVfor teenage girls and ask people to submit
p108
aVtheir writing, their photography, whatever,
p109
aVto be a member of our staff.
p110
aVI got about 3,000 emails.
p111
aVMy editorial director and I went through them and
p112
aVput together a staff of people,
p113
aVand we launched last September.
p114
aVAnd this is an excerpt from my first editor's letter,
p115
aVwhere I say that Rookie, we don't have all the answers,
p116
aVwe're still figuring it out too, but the point is not to
p117
aVgive girls the answers, and not even give them permission
p118
aVto find the answers themselves,
p119
aVbut hopefully inspire them to understand that
p120
aVthey can give themselves that permission,
p121
aVthey can ask their own questions, find their own answers,
p122
aVall of that, and Rookie, I think we've been trying to make it
p123
aVa nice place for all of that to be figured out.
p124
aa(lp125
VSo I'm not saying, "Be like us,"
p126
aVand "We're perfect role models," because we're not,
p127
aVbut we just want to help represent girls
p128
aVin a way that shows those different dimensions.
p129
aVI mean, we have articles called
p130
aV"On Taking Yourself Seriously: How to Not Care What People Think of You,"
p131
aVbut we also have articles like,
p132
aVoops \u2014 I'm figuring it out!
p133
aVHa ha. (Laughter)
p134
aVIf you use that, you can get away with anything.
p135
aVWe also have articles called
p136
aV"How to Look Like You Weren't Just Crying in Less than Five Minutes."
p137
aa(lp138
VSo all of that being said, I still really appreciate
p139
aVthose characters in movies and
p140
aVarticles like that on our site,
p141
aVthat aren't just about being totally powerful,
p142
aVmaybe finding your acceptance with yourself
p143
aVand self-esteem and your flaws and how you accept those.
p144
aa(lp145
VSo what I you to take away from my talk,
p146
aVthe lesson of all of this, is to just be Stevie Nicks.
p147
aVLike, that's all you have to do. (Laughter)
p148
aVBecause my favorite thing about her,
p149
aVother than, like, everything, is that
p150
aVshe is very \u2014 has always been
p151
aVunapologetically present on stage,
p152
aVand unapologetic about her flaws
p153
aVand about reconciling all of her contradictory feelings
p154
aVand she makes you listen to them and think about them,
p155
aVand yeah, so please be Stevie Nicks.
p156
aVThank you. (Applause)
