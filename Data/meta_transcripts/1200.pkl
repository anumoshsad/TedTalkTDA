VWe are losing our listening.
p4
aVWe spend roughly 60 percent of our communication time listening,
p5
aVbut we're not very good at it.
p6
aVWe retain just 25 percent of what we hear.
p7
aVNow \u2014 not you, not this talk,
p8
aVbut that is generally true.
p9
aa(lp10
V(Laughter)
p11
aa(lp12
VLet's define listening as making meaning from sound.
p13
aVIt's a mental process,
p14
aVand it's a process of extraction.
p15
aa(lp16
VWe use some pretty cool techniques to do this.
p17
aVOne of them is pattern recognition.
p18
aV(Crowd noises) So in a cocktail party like this,
p19
aVif I say, "David, Sara, pay attention" \u2014 some of you just sat up.
p20
aVWe recognize patterns to distinguish noise from signal,
p21
aVand especially our name.
p22
aVDifferencing is another technique we use.
p23
aVIf I left this pink noise on for more than a couple of minutes,
p24
aV(Pink noise) you would literally cease to hear it.
p25
aVWe listen to differences; we discount sounds that remain the same.
p26
aa(lp27
VAnd then there is a whole range of filters.
p28
aVThese filters take us from all sound
p29
aVdown to what we pay attention to.
p30
aVMost people are entirely unconscious of these filters.
p31
aVBut they actually create our reality in a way,
p32
aVbecause they tell us what we're paying attention to right now.
p33
aVI'll give you one example of that.
p34
aVIntention is very important in sound, in listening.
p35
aVWhen I married my wife,
p36
aVI promised her I would listen to her every day
p37
aVas if for the first time.
p38
aVNow that's something I fall short of on a daily basis.
p39
aa(lp40
V(Laughter)
p41
aa(lp42
VBut it's a great intention to have in a relationship.
p43
aa(lp44
V(Laughter)
p45
aa(lp46
VBut that's not all.
p47
aVSound places us in space and in time.
p48
aVIf you close your eyes right now in this room,
p49
aVyou're aware of the size of the room
p50
aVfrom the reverberation and the bouncing of the sound off the surfaces;
p51
aVyou're aware of how many people are around you,
p52
aVbecause of the micro-noises you're receiving.
p53
aVAnd sound places us in time as well,
p54
aVbecause sound always has time embedded in it.
p55
aVIn fact, I would suggest that our listening is the main way
p56
aVthat we experience the flow of time
p57
aVfrom past to future.
p58
aVSo, "Sonority is time and meaning" \u2014 a great quote.
p59
aa(lp60
VI said at the beginning, we're losing our listening.
p61
aVWhy did I say that?
p62
aVWell, there are a lot of reasons for this.
p63
aVFirst of all, we invented ways of recording \u2014
p64
aVfirst writing, then audio recording and now video recording as well.
p65
aVThe premium on accurate and careful listening has simply disappeared.
p66
aVSecondly, the world is now so noisy,
p67
aV(Noise) with this cacophony going on visually and auditorily,
p68
aVit's just hard to listen;
p69
aVit's tiring to listen.
p70
aVMany people take refuge in headphones,
p71
aVbut they turn big, public spaces like this,
p72
aVshared soundscapes,
p73
aVinto millions of tiny, little personal sound bubbles.
p74
aVIn this scenario, nobody's listening to anybody.
p75
aa(lp76
VWe're becoming impatient.
p77
aVWe don't want oratory anymore; we want sound bites.
p78
aVAnd the art of conversation is being replaced \u2014 dangerously, I think \u2014
p79
aVby personal broadcasting.
p80
aVI don't know how much listening there is in this conversation,
p81
aVwhich is sadly very common, especially in the UK.
p82
aVWe're becoming desensitized.
p83
aVOur media have to scream at us with these kinds of headlines
p84
aVin order to get our attention.
p85
aVAnd that means it's harder for us to pay attention
p86
aVto the quiet, the subtle, the understated.
p87
aa(lp88
VThis is a serious problem that we're losing our listening.
p89
aVThis is not trivial,
p90
aVbecause listening is our access to understanding.
p91
aVConscious listening always creates understanding,
p92
aVand only without conscious listening
p93
aVcan these things happen.
p94
aVA world where we don't listen to each other at all
p95
aVis a very scary place indeed.
p96
aVSo I'd like to share with you five simple exercises,
p97
aVtools you can take away with you,
p98
aVto improve your own conscious listening.
p99
aVWould you like that?
p100
aa(lp101
VAudience: Yes!
p102
aa(lp103
VGood. The first one is silence.
p104
aVJust three minutes a day of silence is a wonderful exercise
p105
aVto reset your ears and to recalibrate,
p106
aVso that you can hear the quiet again.
p107
aVIf you can't get absolute silence,
p108
aVgo for quiet, that's absolutely fine.
p109
aa(lp110
VSecond, I call this "the mixer."
p111
aV(Noise) So even if you're in a noisy environment like this \u2014
p112
aVand we all spend a lot of time in places like this \u2014
p113
aVlisten in the coffee bar to how many channels of sound can I hear?
p114
aVHow many individual channels in that mix am I listening to?
p115
aVYou can do it in a beautiful place as well, like in a lake.
p116
aVHow many birds am I hearing?
p117
aVWhere are they? Where are those ripples?
p118
aVIt's a great exercise for improving the quality of your listening.
p119
aa(lp120
VThird, this exercise I call "savoring," and this is a beautiful exercise.
p121
aVIt's about enjoying mundane sounds.
p122
aVThis, for example, is my tumble dryer.
p123
aa(lp124
V(Dryer)
p125
aa(lp126
VIt's a waltz \u2014 one, two, three; one, two, three; one, two, three.
p127
aVI love it!
p128
aVOr just try this one on for size.
p129
aa(lp130
V(Coffee grinder)
p131
aa(lp132
VWow!
p133
aVSo, mundane sounds can be really interesting \u2014
p134
aVif you pay attention.
p135
aVI call that the "hidden choir" \u2014 it's around us all the time.
p136
aa(lp137
VThe next exercise is probably the most important of all of these,
p138
aVif you just take one thing away.
p139
aVThis is listening positions \u2014
p140
aVthe idea that you can move your listening position
p141
aVto what's appropriate to what you're listening to.
p142
aVThis is playing with those filters.
p143
aVRemember I gave you those filters?
p144
aVIt's starting to play with them as levers,
p145
aVto get conscious about them and to move to different places.
p146
aVThese are just some of the listening positions,
p147
aVor scales of listening positions, that you can use.
p148
aVThere are many.
p149
aVHave fun with that. It's very exciting.
p150
aa(lp151
VAnd finally, an acronym.
p152
aVYou can use this in listening, in communication.
p153
aVIf you're in any one of those roles \u2014
p154
aVand I think that probably is everybody who's listening to this talk \u2014
p155
aVthe acronym is RASA,
p156
aVwhich is the Sanskrit word for "juice" or "essence."
p157
aVAnd RASA stands for "Receive," which means pay attention to the person;
p158
aV"Appreciate," making little noises like "hmm," "oh," "OK";
p159
aV"Summarize" \u2014 the word "so" is very important in communication;
p160
aVand "Ask," ask questions afterwards.
p161
aa(lp162
VNow sound is my passion, it's my life.
p163
aVI wrote a whole book about it. So I live to listen.
p164
aVThat's too much to ask for most people.
p165
aVBut I believe that every human being needs to listen consciously
p166
aVin order to live fully \u2014
p167
aVconnected in space and in time to the physical world around us,
p168
aVconnected in understanding to each other,
p169
aVnot to mention spiritually connected,
p170
aVbecause every spiritual path I know of has listening and contemplation
p171
aVat its heart.
p172
aa(lp173
VThat's why we need to teach listening in our schools as a skill.
p174
aVWhy is it not taught? It's crazy.
p175
aVAnd if we can teach listening in our schools,
p176
aVwe can take our listening off that slippery slope
p177
aVto that dangerous, scary world that I talked about,
p178
aVand move it to a place where everybody is consciously listening all the time,
p179
aVor at least capable of doing it.
p180
aa(lp181
VNow, I don't know how to do that,
p182
aVbut this is TED,
p183
aVand I think the TED community is capable of anything.
p184
aVSo I invite you to connect with me, connect with each other,
p185
aVtake this mission out.
p186
aVAnd let's get listening taught in schools,
p187
aVand transform the world in one generation
p188
aVto a conscious, listening world \u2014 a world of connection,
p189
aVa world of understanding
p190
aVand a world of peace.
p191
aa(lp192
VThank you for listening to me today.
