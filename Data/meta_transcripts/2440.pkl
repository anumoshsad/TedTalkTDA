VWhat started as a platform for hobbyists
p4
aVis poised to become a multibillion-dollar industry.
p5
aVInspection, environmental monitoring, photography and film and journalism:
p6
aVthese are some of the potential applications for commercial drones,
p7
aVand their enablers are the capabilities being developed
p8
aVat research facilities around the world.
p9
aa(lp10
VFor example, before aerial package delivery
p11
aVentered our social consciousness,
p12
aVan autonomous fleet of flying machines built a six-meter-tall tower
p13
aVcomposed of 1,500 bricks
p14
aVin front of a live audience at the FRAC Centre in France,
p15
aVand several years ago, they started to fly with ropes.
p16
aVBy tethering flying machines,
p17
aVthey can achieve high speeds and accelerations in very tight spaces.
p18
aVThey can also autonomously build tensile structures.
p19
aVSkills learned include how to carry loads,
p20
aVhow to cope with disturbances,
p21
aVand in general, how to interact with the physical world.
p22
aa(lp23
VToday we want to show you some new projects that we've been working on.
p24
aVTheir aim is to push the boundary of what can be achieved
p25
aVwith autonomous flight.
p26
aa(lp27
VNow, for a system to function autonomously,
p28
aVit must collectively know the location of its mobile objects in space.
p29
aVBack at our lab at ETH Zurich,
p30
aVwe often use external cameras to locate objects,
p31
aVwhich then allows us to focus our efforts
p32
aVon the rapid development of highly dynamic tasks.
p33
aVFor the demos you will see today, however,
p34
aVwe will use new localization technology developed by Verity Studios,
p35
aVa spin-off from our lab.
p36
aVThere are no external cameras.
p37
aVEach flying machine uses onboard sensors to determine its location in space
p38
aVand onboard computation to determine what its actions should be.
p39
aVThe only external commands are high-level ones
p40
aVsuch as "take off" and "land."
p41
aa(lp42
VThis is a so-called tail-sitter.
p43
aVIt's an aircraft that tries to have its cake and eat it.
p44
aVLike other fixed-wing aircraft, it is efficient in forward flight,
p45
aVmuch more so than helicopters and variations thereof.
p46
aVUnlike most other fixed-wing aircraft, however,
p47
aVit is capable of hovering,
p48
aVwhich has huge advantages for takeoff, landing
p49
aVand general versatility.
p50
aVThere is no free lunch, unfortunately.
p51
aVOne of the limitations with tail-sitters
p52
aVis that they're susceptible to disturbances such as wind gusts.
p53
aVWe're developing new control architectures and algorithms
p54
aVthat address this limitation.
p55
aVThe idea is for the aircraft to recover
p56
aVno matter what state it finds itself in,
p57
aVand through practice, improve its performance over time.
p58
aa(lp59
V(Applause)
p60
aa(lp61
VOK.
p62
aa(lp63
VWhen doing research,
p64
aVwe often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions
p65
aVthat try to get at the heart of a matter.
p66
aVFor example, one such question would be,
p67
aVwhat is the minimum number of moving parts needed for controlled flight?
p68
aVNow, there are practical reasons
p69
aVwhy you may want to know the answer to such a question.
p70
aVHelicopters, for example,
p71
aVare affectionately known as machines with a thousand moving parts
p72
aVall conspiring to do you bodily harm.
p73
aVIt turns out that decades ago,
p74
aVskilled pilots were able to fly remote-controlled aircraft
p75
aVthat had only two moving parts:
p76
aVa propeller and a tail rudder.
p77
aVWe recently discovered that it could be done with just one.
p78
aa(lp79
VThis is the monospinner,
p80
aVthe world's mechanically simplest controllable flying machine,
p81
aVinvented just a few months ago.
p82
aVIt has only one moving part, a propeller.
p83
aVIt has no flaps, no hinges, no ailerons,
p84
aVno other actuators, no other control surfaces,
p85
aVjust a simple propeller.
p86
aVEven though it's mechanically simple,
p87
aVthere's a lot going on in its little electronic brain
p88
aVto allow it to fly in a stable fashion and to move anywhere it wants in space.
p89
aVEven so, it doesn't yet have
p90
aVthe sophisticated algorithms of the tail-sitter,
p91
aVwhich means that in order to get it to fly,
p92
aVI have to throw it just right.
p93
aVAnd because the probability of me throwing it just right is very low,
p94
aVgiven everybody watching me,
p95
aVwhat we're going to do instead
p96
aVis show you a video that we shot last night.

p101
aa(lp102
VIf the monospinner is an exercise in frugality,
p103
aVthis machine here, the omnicopter, with its eight propellers,
p104
aVis an exercise in excess.
p105
aVWhat can you do with all this surplus?
p106
aVThe thing to notice is that it is highly symmetric.
p107
aVAs a result, it is ambivalent to orientation.
p108
aVThis gives it an extraordinary capability.
p109
aVIt can move anywhere it wants in space
p110
aVirrespective of where it is facing
p111
aVand even of how it is rotating.
p112
aVIt has its own complexities,
p113
aVmainly having to do with the interacting flows
p114
aVfrom its eight propellers.
p115
aVSome of this can be modeled, while the rest can be learned on the fly.
p116
aVLet's take a look.
p117
aa(lp118
V(Applause)
p119
aa(lp120
VIf flying machines are going to enter part of our daily lives,
p121
aVthey will need to become extremely safe and reliable.
p122
aVThis machine over here
p123
aVis actually two separate two-propeller flying machines.
p124
aVThis one wants to spin clockwise.
p125
aVThis other one wants to spin counterclockwise.
p126
aVWhen you put them together,
p127
aVthey behave like one high-performance quadrocopter.
p128
aVIf anything goes wrong, however \u2014
p129
aVa motor fails, a propeller fails, electronics, even a battery pack \u2014
p130
aVthe machine can still fly, albeit in a degraded fashion.
p131
aVWe're going to demonstrate this to you now by disabling one of its halves.
p132
aa(lp133
V(Applause)
p134
aa(lp135
VThis last demonstration
p136
aVis an exploration of synthetic swarms.
p137
aVThe large number of autonomous, coordinated entities
p138
aVoffers a new palette for aesthetic expression.
p139
aVWe've taken commercially available micro quadcopters,
p140
aVeach weighing less than a slice of bread, by the way,
p141
aVand outfitted them with our localization technology
p142
aVand custom algorithms.
p143
aVBecause each unit knows where it is in space
p144
aVand is self-controlled,
p145
aVthere is really no limit to their number.

VHopefully, these demonstrations will motivate you to dream up
p154
aVnew revolutionary roles for flying machines.
p155
aVThat ultrasafe one over there for example
p156
aVhas aspirations to become a flying lampshade on Broadway.
p157
aa(lp158
V(Laughter)
p159
aa(lp160
VThe reality is that it is difficult to predict
p161
aVthe impact of nascent technology.
p162
aVAnd for folks like us, the real reward is the journey and the act of creation.
p163
aVIt's a continual reminder
p164
aVof how wonderful and magical the universe we live in is,
p165
aVthat it allows creative, clever creatures
p166
aVto sculpt it in such spectacular ways.
p167
aVThe fact that this technology
p168
aVhas such huge commercial and economic potential
p169
aVis just icing on the cake.
