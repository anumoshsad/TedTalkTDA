VI'd like to talk today about the two biggest social trends
p4
aVin the coming century,
p5
aVand perhaps in the next 10,000 years.
p6
aVBut I want to start with my work on romantic love,
p7
aVbecause that's my most recent work.
p8
aVWhat I and my colleagues did was put 32 people, who were madly in love,
p9
aVinto a functional MRI brain scanner.
p10
aV17 who were madly in love and their love was accepted;
p11
aVand 15 who were madly in love and they had just been dumped.
p12
aVAnd so I want to tell you about that first,
p13
aVand then go on into where I think love is going.
p14
aa(lp15
V(Laughter)
p16
aa(lp17
V"What 'tis to love?" Shakespeare said.
p18
aVI think our ancestors \u2014
p19
aVI think human beings have been wondering about this question
p20
aVsince they sat around their campfires
p21
aVor lay and watched the stars a million years ago.
p22
aVI started out by trying to figure out what romantic love was
p23
aVby looking at the last 45 years of the psychological research
p24
aVand as it turns out,
p25
aVthere's a very specific group of things that happen when you fall in love.
p26
aVThe first thing that happens is,
p27
aVa person begins to take on what I call, "special meaning."
p28
aVAs a truck driver once said to me,
p29
aV"The world had a new center, and that center was Mary Anne."
p30
aa(lp31
VGeorge Bernard Shaw said it differently.
p32
aV"Love consists of overestimating the differences
p33
aVbetween one woman and another."
p34
aVAnd indeed, that's what we do.
p35
aa(lp36
V(Laughter)
p37
aa(lp38
VAnd then you just focus on this person.
p39
aVYou can list what you don't like about them,
p40
aVbut then you sweep that aside and focus on what you do.
p41
aVAs Chaucer said, "Love is blind."
p42
aa(lp43
VIn trying to understand romantic love,
p44
aVI decided I would read poetry from all over the world,
p45
aVand I just want to give you one very short poem
p46
aVfrom eighth-century China,
p47
aVbecause it's an almost perfect example
p48
aVof a man who is focused totally on a particular woman.
p49
aVIt's a little bit like when you are madly in love with somebody
p50
aVand you walk into a parking lot \u2014
p51
aVtheir car is different from every other car in the parking lot.
p52
aVTheir wine glass at dinner
p53
aVis different from every other wine glass at the dinner party.
p54
aVAnd in this case, a man got hooked on a bamboo sleeping mat.
p55
aa(lp56
VAnd it goes like this.
p57
aVIt's by a guy called Yuan Zhen.
p58
aV"I cannot bear to put away the bamboo sleeping mat.
p59
aVThe night I brought you home, I watched you roll it out."
p60
aVHe became hooked on a sleeping mat,
p61
aVprobably because of elevated activity of dopamine in his brain,
p62
aVjust like with you and me.
p63
aa(lp64
VBut anyway, not only does this person take on special meaning,
p65
aVyou focus your attention on them.
p66
aVYou aggrandize them.
p67
aVBut you have intense energy.
p68
aVAs one Polynesian said, "I felt like jumping in the sky."
p69
aVYou're up all night. You're walking till dawn.
p70
aVYou feel intense elation when things are going well;
p71
aVmood swings into horrible despair when things are going poorly.
p72
aVReal dependence on this person.
p73
aVAs one businessman in New York said to me,
p74
aV"Anything she liked, I liked."
p75
aVSimple. Romantic love is very simple.
p76
aa(lp77
VYou become extremely sexually possessive.
p78
aVYou know, if you're just sleeping with somebody casually,
p79
aVyou don't really care if they're sleeping with somebody else.
p80
aVBut the moment you fall in love,
p81
aVyou become extremely sexually possessive of them.
p82
aVI think there's a Darwinian purpose to this.
p83
aVThe whole point of this is to pull two people together
p84
aVstrongly enough to begin to rear babies as a team.
p85
aa(lp86
VBut the main characteristics of romantic love are craving:
p87
aVan intense craving to be with a particular person,
p88
aVnot just sexually, but emotionally.
p89
aVIt would be nice to go to bed with them,
p90
aVbut you want them to call you on the telephone, to invite you out, etc.,
p91
aVto tell you that they love you.
p92
aVThe other main characteristic is motivation.
p93
aVThe motor in the brain begins to crank, and you want this person.
p94
aa(lp95
VAnd last but not least, it is an obsession.
p96
aVBefore I put these people in the MRI machine,
p97
aVI would ask them all kinds of questions.
p98
aVBut my most important question was always the same.
p99
aVIt was: "What percentage of the day and night do you think about this person?"
p100
aVAnd indeed, they would say,
p101
aV"All day. All night.
p102
aVI can never stop thinking about him or her."
p103
aa(lp104
VAnd then, the very last question \u2014
p105
aVI would always have to work myself up to this question,
p106
aVbecause I'm not a psychologist.
p107
aVI don't work with people in any kind of traumatic situation.
p108
aVMy final question was always the same.
p109
aVI would say, "Would you die for him or her?"
p110
aVAnd, indeed, these people would say "Yes!"
p111
aVas if I had asked them to pass the salt.
p112
aVI was just staggered by it.
p113
aa(lp114
VSo we scanned their brains,
p115
aVlooking at a photograph of their sweetheart
p116
aVand looking at a neutral photograph,
p117
aVwith a distraction task in between.
p118
aVSo we could look at the same brain when it was in that heightened state
p119
aVand when it was in a resting state.
p120
aVAnd we found activity in a lot of brain regions.
p121
aVIn fact, one of the most important was a brain region
p122
aVthat becomes active when you feel the rush of cocaine.
p123
aVAnd indeed, that's exactly what happens.
p124
aa(lp125
VI began to realize that romantic love is not an emotion.
p126
aVIn fact, I had always thought it was a series of emotions,
p127
aVfrom very high to very low.
p128
aVBut actually, it's a drive.
p129
aVIt comes from the motor of the mind,
p130
aVthe wanting part of the mind, the craving part of the mind.
p131
aVThe kind of part of the mind
p132
aVwhen you're reaching for that piece of chocolate,
p133
aVwhen you want to win that promotion at work.
p134
aVThe motor of the brain.
p135
aVIt's a drive.
p136
aa(lp137
VAnd in fact, I think it's more powerful than the sex drive.
p138
aVYou know, if you ask somebody to go to bed with you,
p139
aVand they say, "No, thank you,"
p140
aVyou certainly don't kill yourself or slip into a clinical depression.
p141
aVBut certainly, around the world,
p142
aVpeople who are rejected in love will kill for it.
p143
aVPeople live for love.
p144
aVThey kill for love.
p145
aVThey die for love.
p146
aVThey have songs, poems, novels,
p147
aVsculptures, paintings, myths, legends.
p148
aVIn over 175 societies,
p149
aVpeople have left their evidence of this powerful brain system.
p150
aVI have come to think
p151
aVit's one of the most powerful brain systems on Earth
p152
aVfor both great joy and great sorrow.
p153
aa(lp154
VAnd I've also come to think
p155
aVthat it's one of three basically different brain systems
p156
aVthat evolved from mating and reproduction.
p157
aVOne is the sex drive: the craving for sexual gratification.
p158
aVW.H. Auden called it an "intolerable neural itch,"
p159
aVand indeed, that's what it is.
p160
aVIt keeps bothering you a little bit, like being hungry.
p161
aVThe second of these three brain systems is romantic love:
p162
aVthat elation, obsession of early love.
p163
aVAnd the third brain system is attachment:
p164
aVthat sense of calm and security you can feel for a long-term partner.
p165
aa(lp166
VAnd I think that the sex drive evolved to get you out there,
p167
aVlooking for a whole range of partners.
p168
aVYou can feel it when you're just driving along in your car.
p169
aVIt can be focused on nobody.
p170
aVI think romantic love evolved to enable you to focus your mating energy
p171
aVon just one individual at a time,
p172
aVthereby conserving mating time and energy.
p173
aVAnd I think that attachment, the third brain system,
p174
aVevolved to enable you to tolerate this human being
p175
aVat least long enough to raise a child together as a team.
p176
aVSo with that preamble,
p177
aVI want to go into discussing the two most profound social trends.
p178
aVOne of the last 10,000 years
p179
aVand the other, certainly of the last 25 years,
p180
aVthat are going to have an impact on these three different brain systems:
p181
aVlust, romantic love and deep attachment to a partner.
p182
aa(lp183
VThe first is women working, moving into the workforce.
p184
aVI've looked at 130 societies
p185
aVthrough the demographic yearbooks of the United Nations.
p186
aVEverywhere in the world, 129 out of 130 of them,
p187
aVwomen are not only moving into the job market \u2014
p188
aVsometimes very, very slowly, but they are moving into the job market \u2014
p189
aVand they are very slowly closing that gap between men and women
p190
aVin terms of economic power, health and education.
p191
aVIt's very slow.
p192
aa(lp193
VFor every trend on this planet, there's a counter-trend.
p194
aVWe all know of them, but nevertheless \u2014
p195
aVthe Arabs say, "The dogs may bark, but the caravan moves on."
p196
aVAnd, indeed, that caravan is moving on.
p197
aVWomen are moving back into the job market.
p198
aVAnd I say back into the job market, because this is not new.
p199
aVFor millions of years, on the grasslands of Africa,
p200
aVwomen commuted to work to gather their vegetables.
p201
aVThey came home with 60 to 80 percent of the evening meal.
p202
aVThe double income family was the standard.
p203
aVAnd women were regarded as just as economically,
p204
aVsocially and sexually powerful as men.
p205
aVIn short, we're really moving forward to the past.
p206
aa(lp207
VThen, women's worst invention was the plow.
p208
aVWith the beginning of plow agriculture, men's roles became extremely powerful.
p209
aVWomen lost their ancient jobs as collectors,
p210
aVbut then with the industrial revolution and the post-industrial revolution
p211
aVthey're moving back into the job market.
p212
aVIn short, they are acquiring the status that they had a million years ago,
p213
aV10,000 years ago, 100,000 years ago.
p214
aVWe are seeing now one of the most remarkable traditions
p215
aVin the history of the human animal.
p216
aVAnd it's going to have an impact.
p217
aa(lp218
VI generally give a whole lecture
p219
aVon the impact of women on the business community.
p220
aVI'll say just a couple of things, and then go on to sex and love.
p221
aVThere's a lot of gender differences;
p222
aVanybody who thinks men and women are alike
p223
aVsimply never had a boy and a girl child.
p224
aVI don't know why they want to think that men and women are alike.
p225
aVThere's much we have in common,
p226
aVbut there's a whole lot that we do not have in common.
p227
aa(lp228
VWe are \u2014 in the words of Ted Hughes,
p229
aV"I think that we are like two feet. We need each other to get ahead."
p230
aVBut we did not evolve to have the same brain.
p231
aVAnd we're finding more and more gender differences in the brain.
p232
aVI'll only just use a couple and then move on to sex and love.
p233
aVOne of them is women's verbal ability.
p234
aVWomen can talk.
p235
aa(lp236
VWomen's ability to find the right word rapidly, basic articulation
p237
aVgoes up in the middle of the menstrual cycle,
p238
aVwhen estrogen levels peak.
p239
aVBut even at menstruation, they're better than the average man.
p240
aVWomen can talk.
p241
aVThey've been doing it for a million years; words were women's tools.
p242
aVThey held that baby in front of their face,
p243
aVcajoling it, reprimanding it, educating it with words.
p244
aVAnd, indeed, they're becoming a very powerful force.
p245
aa(lp246
VEven in places like India and Japan,
p247
aVwhere women are not moving rapidly into the regular job market,
p248
aVthey're moving into journalism.
p249
aVAnd I think that the television is like the global campfire.
p250
aVWe sit around it and it shapes our minds.
p251
aVAlmost always, when I'm on TV, the producer who calls me,
p252
aVwho negotiates what we're going to say,
p253
aVis a woman.
p254
aVIn fact, Solzhenitsyn once said,
p255
aV"To have a great writer is to have another government."
p256
aa(lp257
VToday 54 percent of people who are writers in America are women.
p258
aVIt's one of many, many characteristics that women have
p259
aVthat they will bring into the job market.
p260
aVThey've got incredible people skills, negotiating skills.
p261
aVThey're highly imaginative.
p262
aVWe now know the brain circuitry of imagination, of long-term planning.
p263
aVThey tend to be web thinkers.
p264
aVBecause the female parts of the brain are better connected,
p265
aVthey tend to collect more pieces of data when they think,
p266
aVput them into more complex patterns, see more options and outcomes.
p267
aVThey tend to be contextual, holistic thinkers,
p268
aVwhat I call web thinkers.
p269
aa(lp270
VMen tend to \u2014 and these are averages \u2014
p271
aVtend to get rid of what they regard as extraneous,
p272
aVfocus on what they do,
p273
aVand move in a more step-by-step thinking pattern.
p274
aVThey're both perfectly good ways of thinking.
p275
aVWe need both of them to get ahead.
p276
aVIn fact, there's many more male geniuses in the world.
p277
aVAnd there's also many more male idiots in the world.
p278
aa(lp279
V(Laughter)
p280
aa(lp281
VWhen the male brain works well, it works extremely well.
p282
aVAnd what I really think that we're doing is,
p283
aVwe're moving towards a collaborative society,
p284
aVa society in which the talents of both men and women
p285
aVare becoming understood and valued and employed.
p286
aa(lp287
VBut in fact, women moving into the job market
p288
aVis having a huge impact on sex and romance and family life.
p289
aVForemost, women are starting to express their sexuality.
p290
aVI'm always astonished when people come to me and say,
p291
aV"Why is it that men are so adulterous?"
p292
aV"Why do you think more men are adulterous than women?"
p293
aV"Well, men are more adulterous!"
p294
aVAnd I say, "Who do you think these men are sleeping with?"
p295
aa(lp296
V(Laughter)
p297
aa(lp298
VAnd \u2014 basic math!
p299
aa(lp300
VAnyway.
p301
aVIn the Western world,
p302
aVwomen start sooner at sex, have more partners,
p303
aVexpress less remorse for the partners that they do,
p304
aVmarry later, have fewer children,
p305
aVleave bad marriages in order to get good ones.
p306
aVWe are seeing the rise of female sexual expression.
p307
aVAnd, indeed, once again we're moving forward to the kind of sexual expression
p308
aVthat we probably saw on the grasslands of Africa a million years ago,
p309
aVbecause this is the kind of sexual expression that we see
p310
aVin hunting and gathering societies today.
p311
aa(lp312
VWe're also returning to an ancient form of marriage equality.
p313
aVThey're now saying that the 21st century
p314
aVis going to be the century of what they call the "symmetrical marriage,"
p315
aVor the "pure marriage," or the "companionate marriage."
p316
aVThis is a marriage between equals,
p317
aVmoving forward to a pattern
p318
aVthat is highly compatible with the ancient human spirit.
p319
aa(lp320
VWe're also seeing a rise of romantic love.
p321
aV91 percent of American women and 86 percent of American men
p322
aVwould not marry somebody who had every single quality
p323
aVthey were looking for in a partner,
p324
aVif they were not in love with that person.
p325
aVPeople around the world, in a study of 37 societies,
p326
aVwant to be in love with the person that they marry.
p327
aVIndeed, arranged marriages are on their way off this braid of human life.
p328
aa(lp329
VI even think that marriages might even become more stable
p330
aVbecause of the second great world trend.
p331
aVThe first one being women moving into the job market,
p332
aVthe second one being the aging world population.
p333
aVThey're now saying that in America,
p334
aVthat middle age should be regarded as up to age 85.
p335
aVBecause in that highest age category of 76 to 85,
p336
aVas much as 40 percent of people have nothing really wrong with them.
p337
aVSo we're seeing there's a real extension of middle age.
p338
aa(lp339
VFor one of my books, I looked at divorce data in 58 societies.
p340
aVAnd as it turns out, the older you get, the less likely you are to divorce.
p341
aVSo the divorce rate right now is stable in America,
p342
aVand it's actually beginning to decline.
p343
aVIt may decline some more.
p344
aVI would even say that with Viagra,
p345
aVestrogen replacement, hip replacements
p346
aVand the incredibly interesting women
p347
aV\u2014 women have never been as interesting as they are now.
p348
aVNot at any time on this planet have women been so educated,
p349
aVso interesting, so capable.
p350
aVAnd so I honestly think that if there really was ever a time in human evolution
p351
aVwhen we have the opportunity to make good marriages, that time is now.
p352
aa(lp353
VHowever, there's always kinds of complications in this.
p354
aVThese three brain systems \u2014 lust, romantic love and attachment \u2014
p355
aVdon't always go together.
p356
aVThey can go together, by the way.
p357
aVThat's why casual sex isn't so casual.
p358
aVWith orgasm you get a spike of dopamine.
p359
aVDopamine's associated with romantic love,
p360
aVand you can just fall in love with somebody
p361
aVwho you're just having casual sex with.
p362
aVWith orgasm, then you get a real rush of oxytocin and vasopressin \u2014
p363
aVthose are associated with attachment.
p364
aVThis is why you can feel such a sense of cosmic union with somebody
p365
aVafter you've made love to them.
p366
aa(lp367
VBut these three brain systems: lust, romantic love and attachment,
p368
aVaren't always connected to each other.
p369
aVYou can feel deep attachment to a long-term partner
p370
aVwhile you feel intense romantic love for somebody else,
p371
aVwhile you feel the sex drive for people unrelated to these other partners.
p372
aVIn short, we're capable of loving more than one person at a time.
p373
aVIn fact, you can lie in bed at night
p374
aVand swing from deep feelings of attachment for one person
p375
aVto deep feelings of romantic love for somebody else.
p376
aVIt's as if there's a committee meeting going on in your head
p377
aVas you are trying to decide what to do.
p378
aVSo I don't think, honestly,
p379
aVwe're an animal that was built to be happy;
p380
aVwe are an animal that was built to reproduce.
p381
aVI think the happiness we find, we make.
p382
aVAnd I think, however,
p383
aVwe can make good relationships with each other.
p384
aa(lp385
VSo I want to conclude with two things.
p386
aVI want to conclude with a worry,
p387
aVand with a wonderful story.
p388
aVThe worry is about antidepressants.
p389
aVOver 100 million prescriptions of antidepressants
p390
aVare written every year in the United States.
p391
aVAnd these drugs are going generic.
p392
aVThey are seeping around the world.
p393
aVI know one girl who's been on these antidepressants,
p394
aVSSRIs, serotonin-enhancing antidepressants \u2014 since she was 13.
p395
aVShe's 23. She's been on them ever since she was 13.
p396
aa(lp397
VI've got nothing against people who take them short term,
p398
aVwhen they're going through something horrible.
p399
aVThey want to commit suicide or kill somebody else.
p400
aVI would recommend it.
p401
aVBut more and more people in the United States
p402
aVare taking them long term.
p403
aVAnd indeed, what these drugs do is raise levels of serotonin.
p404
aVAnd by raising levels of serotonin, you suppress the dopamine circuit.
p405
aVEverybody knows that.
p406
aVDopamine is associated with romantic love.
p407
aVNot only do they suppress the dopamine circuit,
p408
aVbut they kill the sex drive.
p409
aVAnd when you kill the sex drive, you kill orgasm.
p410
aVAnd when you kill orgasm,
p411
aVyou kill that flood of drugs associated with attachment.
p412
aVThe things are connected in the brain.
p413
aVAnd when you tamper with one brain system,
p414
aVyou're going to tamper with another.
p415
aVI'm just simply saying that a world without love is a deadly place.
p416
aa(lp417
VSo now \u2014
p418
aa(lp419
V(Applause)
p420
aa(lp421
VThank you.
p422
aa(lp423
VI want to end with a story.
p424
aVAnd then, just a comment.
p425
aVI've been studying romantic love and sex and attachment for 30 years.
p426
aVI'm an identical twin; I am interested in why we're all alike.
p427
aVWhy you and I are alike, why the Iraqis and the Japanese
p428
aVand the Australian Aborigines and the people of the Amazon River
p429
aVare all alike.
p430
aVAnd about a year ago,
p431
aVan Internet dating service, Match.com, came to me
p432
aVand asked me if I would design a new dating site for them.
p433
aVI said, "I don't know anything about personality. You know?
p434
aVI don't know. Do you think you've got the right person?"
p435
aVThey said, "Yes."
p436
aVIt got me thinking about why it is that you fall in love
p437
aVwith one person rather than another.
p438
aa(lp439
VThat's my current project; it will be my next book.
p440
aVThere's all kinds of reasons
p441
aVthat you fall in love with one person rather than another.
p442
aVTiming is important. Proximity is important.
p443
aVMystery is important.
p444
aVYou fall in love with somebody who's somewhat mysterious,
p445
aVin part because mystery elevates dopamine in the brain,
p446
aVprobably pushes you over that threshold to fall in love.
p447
aVYou fall in love with somebody
p448
aVwho fits within what I call your "love map,"
p449
aVan unconscious list of traits
p450
aVthat you build in childhood as you grow up.
p451
aVAnd I also think that you gravitate to certain people,
p452
aVactually, with somewhat complementary brain systems.
p453
aVAnd that's what I'm now contributing to this.
p454
aa(lp455
VBut I want to tell you a story, to illustrate.
p456
aVI've been carrying on here about the biology of love.
p457
aVI wanted to show you a little bit about the culture of it, too,
p458
aVthe magic of it.
p459
aVIt's a story that was told to me
p460
aVby somebody who had heard it just from one \u2014
p461
aVprobably a true story.
p462
aVIt was a graduate student \u2014 I'm at Rutgers and my two colleagues \u2014
p463
aVArt Aron is at SUNY Stony Brook.
p464
aVThat's where we put our people in the MRI machine.
p465
aa(lp466
VAnd this graduate student was madly in love with another graduate student,
p467
aVand she was not in love with him.
p468
aVAnd they were all at a conference in Beijing.
p469
aVAnd he knew from our work
p470
aVthat if you go and do something very novel with somebody,
p471
aVyou can drive up the dopamine in the brain,
p472
aVand perhaps trigger this brain system for romantic love.
p473
aa(lp474
V(Laughter)
p475
aa(lp476
VSo he decided he'd put science to work.
p477
aVAnd he invited this girl to go off on a rickshaw ride with him.
p478
aa(lp479
VAnd sure enough \u2014 I've never been in one,
p480
aVbut apparently they go all around the buses and the trucks
p481
aVand it's crazy and it's noisy and it's exciting.
p482
aVHe figured that this would drive up the dopamine,
p483
aVand she'd fall in love with him.
p484
aVSo off they go and she's squealing and squeezing him
p485
aVand laughing and having a wonderful time.
p486
aVAn hour later they get down off of the rickshaw,
p487
aVand she throws her hands up and she says,
p488
aV"Wasn't that wonderful?"
p489
aVAnd, "Wasn't that rickshaw driver handsome!"
p490
aa(lp491
V(Laughter)
p492
aa(lp493
V(Applause)
p494
aa(lp495
VThere's magic to love!
p496
aa(lp497
V(Applause)
p498
aa(lp499
VBut I will end by saying that millions of years ago,
p500
aVwe evolved three basic drives:
p501
aVthe sex drive, romantic love
p502
aVand attachment to a long-term partner.
p503
aVThese circuits are deeply embedded in the human brain.
p504
aVThey're going to survive as long as our species survives
p505
aVon what Shakespeare called "this mortal coil."
