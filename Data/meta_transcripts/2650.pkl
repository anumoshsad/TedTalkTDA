VLet me ask you all a question.
p4
aVHow much weapons-grade nuclear material do you think it would take
p5
aVto level a city the size of San Francisco?
p6
aVHow many of you think it would be an amount
p7
aVabout the size of this suitcase?
p8
aVOK. And how about this minibus?
p9
aa(lp10
VAll right.
p11
aVWell actually, under the right circumstances,
p12
aVan amount of highly enriched uranium about the size of your morning latte
p13
aVwould be enough to kill 100,000 people
p14
aVinstantly.
p15
aVHundreds of thousands of others would become horribly ill,
p16
aVand parts of the city would be uninhabitable for years,
p17
aVif not for decades.
p18
aa(lp19
VBut you can forget that nuclear latte,
p20
aVbecause today's nuclear weapons are hundreds of times more powerful
p21
aVeven than those we dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
p22
aVAnd even a limited nuclear war involving, say, tens of nuclear weapons,
p23
aVcould lead to the end of all life on the planet.
p24
aa(lp25
VSo it's really important that you know
p26
aVthat right now we have over 15,000 nuclear weapons
p27
aVin the hands of nine nations.
p28
aVAnd if you live in a city or near a military facility,
p29
aVone is likely pointed right at you.
p30
aVIn fact, if you live in any of the rural areas
p31
aVwhere nuclear weapons are stored globally,
p32
aVone is likely pointed at you.
p33
aVAbout 1,800 of these weapons are on high alert,
p34
aVwhich means they can be launched within 15 minutes
p35
aVof a presidential command.
p36
aa(lp37
VSo I know this is a bummer of an issue,
p38
aVand maybe you have that \u2014 what was it? \u2014 psychic fatigue
p39
aVthat we heard about a little bit earlier.
p40
aVSo I'm going to switch gears for just a second,
p41
aVand I'm going to talk about my imaginary friend,
p42
aVwho I like to think of as Jasmine,
p43
aVjust for a moment.
p44
aa(lp45
VJasmine, at the age of 25,
p46
aVis part of a generation that is more politically and socially engaged
p47
aVthan anything we've seen in 50 years.
p48
aVShe and her friends think of themselves
p49
aVas change agents and leaders and activists.
p50
aVI think of them as Generation Possible.
p51
aVThey regularly protest about the issues they care about,
p52
aVbut nuclear weapons are not one of them, which makes sense,
p53
aVbecause Jasmine was born in 1991, at the end of the Cold War.
p54
aVSo she didn't grow up hearing a lot about nuclear weapons.
p55
aVShe never had to duck and cover under her desk at school.
p56
aVFor Jasmine, a fallout shelter is an app in the Android store.
p57
aVNuclear weapons help win games.
p58
aVAnd that is really a shame,
p59
aVbecause right now, we need Generation Possible
p60
aVto help us make some really important decisions about nuclear weapons.
p61
aa(lp62
VFor instance, will we further reduce our nuclear arsenals globally,
p63
aVor will we spend billions,
p64
aVmaybe a trillion dollars,
p65
aVto modernize them so they last throughout the 21st century,
p66
aVso that by the time Jasmine is my age, she's talking to her children
p67
aVand maybe even her grandchildren
p68
aVabout the threat of nuclear holocaust?
p69
aVAnd if you're paying any attention at all to cyberthreats,
p70
aVor, for instance, if you've read about the Stuxnet virus
p71
aVor, for God's sake, if you've ever had an email account or a Yahoo account
p72
aVor a phone hacked,
p73
aVyou can imagine the whole new world of hurt that could be triggered
p74
aVby modernization in a period of cyberwarfare.
p75
aa(lp76
VNow, if you're paying attention to the money,
p77
aVa trillion dollars could go a long way
p78
aVto feeding and educating and employing people,
p79
aVall of which could reduce the threat of nuclear war to begin with.
p80
aVSo \u2014
p81
aa(lp82
V(Applause)
p83
aa(lp84
VThis is really crucial right now,
p85
aVbecause nuclear weapons \u2014 they're vulnerable.
p86
aVWe have solid evidence
p87
aVthat terrorists are trying to get ahold of them.
p88
aVJust this last spring,
p89
aVwhen four retirees and two taxi drivers were arrested
p90
aVin the Republic of Georgia
p91
aVfor trying to sell nuclear materials for 200 million dollars,
p92
aVthey demonstrated that the black market for this stuff is alive and well.
p93
aVAnd it's really important,
p94
aVbecause there have been dozens of accidents
p95
aVinvolving nuclear weapons,
p96
aVand I bet most of us have never heard anything about them.
p97
aa(lp98
VJust here in the United States,
p99
aVwe've dropped nuclear weapons on the Carolinas twice.
p100
aVIn one case, one of the bombs,
p101
aVwhich fell out of an Air Force plane,
p102
aVdidn't detonate
p103
aVbecause the nuclear core was stored somewhere else on the plane.
p104
aVIn another case, the weapon did arm when it hit the ground,
p105
aVand five of the switches designed to keep it from detonating failed.
p106
aVLuckily, the sixth one didn't.
p107
aVBut if that's not enough to get your attention,
p108
aVthere was the 1995 Black Brant incident.
p109
aVThat's when Russian radar technicians saw
p110
aVwhat they thought was a US nuclear missile
p111
aVstreaking towards Russian airspace.
p112
aVIt later turned out to be a Norwegian rocket
p113
aVcollecting data about the northern lights.
p114
aVBut at that time,
p115
aVRussian President Boris Yeltsin came within five minutes
p116
aVof launching a full-scale retaliatory nuclear attack
p117
aVagainst the United States.
p118
aa(lp119
VSo, most of the world's nuclear nations
p120
aVhave committed to getting rid of these weapons of mass destruction.
p121
aVBut consider this:
p122
aVthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,
p123
aVwhich is the most widely adopted arms control treaty in history
p124
aVwith 190 signatories,
p125
aVsets no specific date by which the world's nuclear-armed nations
p126
aVwill get rid of their nuclear weapons.
p127
aa(lp128
VNow, when John F. Kennedy sent a man to the moon
p129
aVand decided to bring him back, or decided to do both those things,
p130
aVhe didn't say, "Hey, whenever you guys get to it."
p131
aVHe gave us a deadline.
p132
aVHe gave us a challenge
p133
aVthat would have been incredible just a few years earlier.
p134
aVAnd with that challenge,
p135
aVhe inspired scientists and marketers,
p136
aVastronauts and schoolteachers.
p137
aVHe gave us a vision.
p138
aVBut along with that vision,
p139
aVhe also tried to give us \u2014 and most people don't know this, either \u2014
p140
aVhe tried to give us a partner
p141
aVin the form of our fiercest Cold War rival, the Soviet Union.
p142
aVBecause part of Kennedy's vision for the Apollo program
p143
aVwas that it be a cooperation, not a competition, with the Soviets.
p144
aVAnd apparently, Nikita Khrushchev, the Soviet Premier, agreed.
p145
aVBut before that cooperation could be realized,
p146
aVKennedy was assassinated,
p147
aVand that part of the vision was deferred.
p148
aa(lp149
VBut the promise of joint innovation between these two nuclear superpowers
p150
aVwasn't totally extinguished.
p151
aVBecause in 1991, which is the year that Jasmine was born
p152
aVand the Soviet Union fell,
p153
aVthese two nations engaged in a project
p154
aVthat genuinely does seem incredible today
p155
aVin the truest sense of that word,
p156
aVwhich is that the US sent cash to the Russians when they needed it most,
p157
aVto secure loose nuclear materials
p158
aVand to employ out-of-work nuclear scientists.
p159
aVThey worked alongside American scientists to convert weapons-grade uranium
p160
aVinto the type of fuel that can be used for nuclear power instead.
p161
aVThey called it, "Megatons to Megawatts."
p162
aVSo the result is that for over 20 years,
p163
aVour two nations had a program
p164
aVthat meant that one in 10 lightbulbs in the United States
p165
aVwas essentially fueled by former Russian warheads.
p166
aa(lp167
VSo, together these two nations did something truly audacious.
p168
aVBut the good news is, the global community has the chance
p169
aVto do something just as audacious today.
p170
aVTo get rid of nuclear weapons
p171
aVand to end the supply of the materials required to produce them,
p172
aVsome experts tell me would take 30 years.
p173
aVIt would take a renaissance of sorts,
p174
aVthe kinds of innovation that, for better or worse,
p175
aVunderpinned both the Manhattan Project, which gave rise to nuclear weapons,
p176
aVand the Megatons to Megawatts program.
p177
aVIt would take design constraints.
p178
aVThese are fundamental to creativity,
p179
aVthings like a platform for international collaboration;
p180
aVa date certain, which is a forcing mechanism;
p181
aVand a positive vision that inspires action.
p182
aVIt would take us to 2045.
p183
aa(lp184
VNow, 2045 happens to be the 100th anniversary
p185
aVof the birth of nuclear weapons in the New Mexico desert.
p186
aVBut it's also an important date for another reason.
p187
aVIt's predicted to be the advent of the singularity,
p188
aVa new moment in human development,
p189
aVwhere the lines between artificial intelligence and human intelligence blur,
p190
aVwhere computing and consciousness become almost indistinguishable
p191
aVand advanced technologies help us solve the 21st century's greatest problems:
p192
aVhunger, energy, poverty,
p193
aVushering in an era of abundance.
p194
aVAnd we all get to go to space
p195
aVon our way to becoming a multi-planetary species.
p196
aa(lp197
VNow, the people who really believe this vision are the first to say
p198
aVthey don't yet know precisely how we're going to get there.
p199
aVBut the values behind their vision
p200
aVand the willingness to ask "How might we?"
p201
aVhave inspired a generation of innovators.
p202
aVThey're working backward from the outcomes they want,
p203
aVusing the creative problem-solving methods of collaborative design.
p204
aVThey're busting through obstacles.
p205
aVThey're redefining what we all consider possible.
p206
aa(lp207
VBut here's the thing:
p208
aVthat vision of abundance isn't compatible
p209
aVwith a world that still relies on a 20th-century nuclear doctrine
p210
aVcalled "mutually assured destruction."
p211
aVIt has to be about building the foundations for the 22nd century.
p212
aVIt has to be about strategies for mutually assured prosperity
p213
aVor, at the very least, mutually assured survival.
p214
aa(lp215
VNow, every day, I get to meet people who are real pioneers
p216
aVin the field of nuclear threats.
p217
aVAs you can see, many of them are young women,
p218
aVand they're doing fiercely interesting stuff,
p219
aVlike Mareena Robinson Snowden here, who is developing new ways,
p220
aVbetter ways, to detect nuclear warheads,
p221
aVwhich will help us overcome a critical hurdle
p222
aVto international disarmament.
p223
aVOr Melissa Hanham, who is using satellite imaging
p224
aVto make sense of what's going on around far-flung nuclear sites.
p225
aVOr we have Beatrice Fihn in Europe,
p226
aVwho has been campaigning to make nuclear weapons illegal
p227
aVin international courts of law,
p228
aVand just won a big victory at the UN last week.
p229
aa(lp230
V(Applause)
p231
aa(lp232
VAnd yet,
p233
aVand yet,
p234
aVwith all of our talk in this culture about moon shots,
p235
aVtoo few members of Generation Possible and those of us who mentor them
p236
aVare taking on nuclear weapons.
p237
aVIt's as if there's a taboo.
p238
aVBut I remember something Kennedy said that has really stuck with me,
p239
aVand that is something to the effect
p240
aVthat humans can be as big as the solutions
p241
aVto all the problems we've created.
p242
aVNo problem of human destiny, he said,
p243
aVis beyond human beings.
p244
aVI believe that.
p245
aVAnd I bet a lot of you here believe that, too.
p246
aVAnd I know Generation Possible believes it.
p247
aa(lp248
VSo it's time to commit to a date.
p249
aVLet's end the nuclear weapons chapter
p250
aVon the 100th anniversary of its inception.
p251
aVAfter all, by 2045, we will have held billions of people hostage
p252
aVto the threat of nuclear annihilation.
p253
aVSurely, 100 years will have been enough.
p254
aVSurely, a century of economic development
p255
aVand the development of military strategy
p256
aVwill have given us better ways to manage global conflict.
p257
aVSurely, if ever there was a global moon shot worth supporting,
p258
aVthis is it.
p259
aa(lp260
VNow, in the face of real threats \u2014
p261
aVfor instance, North Korea's recent nuclear weapons tests,
p262
aVwhich fly in the face of sanctions \u2014
p263
aVreasonable people disagree
p264
aVabout whether we should maintain some number of nuclear weapons
p265
aVto deter aggression.
p266
aVBut the question is: What's the magic number?
p267
aVIs it a thousand?
p268
aVIs it a hundred? Ten?
p269
aVAnd then we have to ask:
p270
aVWho should be responsible for them?
p271
aVI think we can agree, however,
p272
aVthat having 15,000 of them represents a greater global threat
p273
aVto Jasmine's generation than a promise.
p274
aa(lp275
VSo it's time we make a promise
p276
aVof a world in which we've broken the stranglehold
p277
aVthat nuclear weapons have on our imaginations;
p278
aVin which we invest in the creative solutions
p279
aVthat come from working backward from the future we desperately want,
p280
aVrather than plodding forward from a present
p281
aVthat brings all of the mental models and biases of the past with it.
p282
aVIt's time we pledge our resources as leaders across the spectrum
p283
aVto work on this old problem in new ways,
p284
aVto ask, "How might we?"
p285
aVHow might we make good on a promise
p286
aVof greater security for Jasmine's generation
p287
aVin a world beyond nuclear weapons?
p288
aVI truly hope you will join us.
p289
aa(lp290
