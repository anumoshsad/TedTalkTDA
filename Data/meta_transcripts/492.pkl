VIf you're at all like me,
p4
aVthis is what you do with the sunny summer weekends in San Francisco:
p5
aVyou build experimental kite-powered hydrofoils
p6
aVcapable of more than 30 knots.
p7
aVAnd you realize that there is incredible power in the wind,
p8
aVand it can do amazing things.
p9
aVAnd one day, a vessel not unlike this
p10
aVwill probably break the world speed record.
p11
aa(lp12
VBut kites aren't just toys like this.
p13
aVKites: I'm going to give you a brief history,
p14
aVand tell you about the magnificent future
p15
aVof every child's favorite plaything.
p16
aVSo, kites are more than a thousand years old,
p17
aVand the Chinese used them for military applications,
p18
aVand even for lifting men.
p19
aVSo they knew at that stage they could carry large weights.
p20
aVI'm not sure why there is a hole in this particular man.
p21
aa(lp22
V(Laughter)
p23
aa(lp24
VIn 1827, a fellow called George Pocock
p25
aVactually pioneered the use of kites for towing buggies
p26
aVin races against horse carriages across the English countryside.
p27
aVThen of course, at the dawn of aviation,
p28
aVall of the great inventors of the time \u2014
p29
aVlike Hargreaves, like Langley,
p30
aVeven Alexander Graham Bell, inventor of the telephone, who was flying this kite \u2014
p31
aVwere doing so in the pursuit of aviation.
p32
aa(lp33
VThen these two fellows came along,
p34
aVand they were flying kites to develop the control systems
p35
aVthat would ultimately enable powered human flight.
p36
aVSo this is of course Orville and Wilbur Wright,
p37
aVand the Wright Flyer.
p38
aVAnd their experiments with kites led to this
p39
aVmomentous occasion, where we powered up and took off for the
p40
aVfirst-ever 12-second human flight.
p41
aVAnd that was fantastic for the future of commercial aviation.
p42
aa(lp43
VBut unfortunately, it relegated kites once again to be considered children's toys.
p44
aVThat was until the 1970s, where we had the last energy crisis.
p45
aVAnd a fabulous man called Miles Loyd
p46
aVwho lives on the outskirts of San Francisco,
p47
aVwrote this seminal paper that was completely ignored
p48
aVin the Journal of Energy
p49
aVabout how to use basically an airplane on a piece of string
p50
aVto generate enormous amounts of electricity.
p51
aVThe real key observation he made is that
p52
aVa free-flying wing can sweep through more sky and generate more power
p53
aVin a unit of time than a fixed-wing turbine.
p54
aa(lp55
VSo turbines grew. And they can now span up to three hundred feet at the hub height,
p56
aVbut they can't really go a lot higher,
p57
aVand more height is where the more wind is, and more power \u2014
p58
aVas much as twice as much.
p59
aa(lp60
VSo cut to now. We still have an energy crisis,
p61
aVand now we have a climate crisis as well. You know,
p62
aVso humans generate about 12 trillion watts,
p63
aVor 12 terawatts, from fossil fuels.
p64
aVAnd Al Gore has spoken to why we need to hit one of these targets,
p65
aVand in reality what that means is in the next 30 to 40 years,
p66
aVwe have to make 10 trillion watts or more of new clean energy somehow.
p67
aVWind is the second-largest renewable resource after solar:
p68
aV3600 terawatts, more than enough to supply humanity 200 times over.
p69
aVThe majority of it is in the higher altitudes, above 300 feet,
p70
aVwhere we don't have a technology as yet to get there.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo this is the dawn of the new age of kites.
p73
aVThis is our test site on Maui, flying across the sky.
p74
aVI'm now going to show you
p75
aVthe first autonomous generation of power
p76
aVby every child's favorite plaything.
p77
aVAs you can tell, you need to be a robot to fly this thing for thousands of hours.
p78
aVIt makes you a little nauseous.
p79
aVAnd here we're actually generating about 10 kilowatts \u2014
p80
aVso, enough to power probably five United States households \u2014
p81
aVwith a kite not much larger than this piano.
p82
aVAnd the real significant thing here
p83
aVis we're developing the control systems,
p84
aVas did the Wright brothers, that would enable sustained, long-duration flight.
p85
aVAnd it doesn't hurt to do it in a location like this either.
p86
aa(lp87
VSo this is the equivalent for a kite flier of peeing in the snow \u2014
p88
aVthat's tracing your name in the sky.
p89
aa(lp90
VAnd this is where we're actually going.
p91
aVSo we're beyond the 12-second steps.
p92
aVAnd we're working towards megawatt-scale machines
p93
aVthat fly at 2000 feet and generate tons of clean electricity.
p94
aa(lp95
VSo you ask, how big are those machines?
p96
aVWell, this paper plane would be maybe a \u2014 oop!
p97
aVThat would be enough to power your cell phone.
p98
aVYour Cessna would be 230 killowatts.
p99
aVIf you'd loan me your Gulfstream, I'll rip its wings off and generate you a megawatt.
p100
aVIf you give me a 747, I'll make six megawatts,
p101
aVwhich is more than the largest wind turbines today.
p102
aVAnd the Spruce Goose would be a 15-megawatt wing.
p103
aa(lp104
VSo that is audacious, you say. I agree.
p105
aVBut audacious is what has happened many times before in history.
p106
aVThis is a refrigerator factory,
p107
aVchurning out airplanes for World War II.
p108
aVPrior to World War II, they were making 1000 planes a year.
p109
aVBy 1945, they were making 100,000.
p110
aVWith this factory and 100,000 planes a year,
p111
aVwe could make all of America's electricity in about 10 years.
p112
aa(lp113
VSo really this is a story about the audacious plans of young people
p114
aVwith these dreams. There are many of us.
p115
aVI am lucky enough to work with 30 of them.
p116
aVAnd I think we need to support all of the dreams
p117
aVof the kids out there doing these crazy things.
p118
aVThank you.
