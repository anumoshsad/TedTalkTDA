VHi. I'm Kevin Allocca, I'm the trends manager at YouTube,
p4
aVand I professionally watch YouTube videos.
p5
aVIt's true.
p6
aVSo we're going to talk a little bit today about how videos go viral
p7
aVand then why that even matters.
p8
aVWe all want to be stars \u2014
p9
aVcelebrities, singers, comedians \u2014
p10
aVand when I was younger, that seemed so very, very hard to do.
p11
aVBut now Web video has made it
p12
aVso that any of us or any of the creative things that we do
p13
aVcan become completely famous
p14
aVin a part of our world's culture.
p15
aVAny one of you could be famous on the Internet
p16
aVby next Saturday.
p17
aVBut there are over 48 hours of video uploaded to YouTube
p18
aVevery minute.
p19
aVAnd of that, only a tiny percentage
p20
aVever goes viral and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment.
p21
aVSo how does it happen?
p22
aVThree things:
p23
aVtastemakers, communities of participation
p24
aVand unexpectedness.
p25
aVAll right, let's go.
p26
aa(lp27
V(Video) Bear Vasquez: Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
p28
aVOh, my God!
p29
aVWooo!
p30
aVOhhhhh, wowwww!
p31
aa(lp32
VKA: Last year, Bear Vasquez posted this video
p33
aVthat he had shot outside his home in Yosemite National Park.
p34
aVIn 2010, it was viewed 23 million times.
p35
aV(Laughter)
p36
aVThis is a chart of what it looked like
p37
aVwhen it first became popular last summer.
p38
aVBut he didn't actually set out to make a viral video, Bear.
p39
aVHe just wanted to share a rainbow.
p40
aVBecause that's what you do when your name is Yosemite Mountain Bear.
p41
aV(Laughter)
p42
aVAnd he had posted lots of nature videos in fact.
p43
aVAnd this video had actually been posted
p44
aVall the way back in January.
p45
aVSo what happened here?
p46
aVJimmy Kimmel actually.
p47
aVJimmy Kimmel posted this tweet
p48
aVthat would eventually propel the video to be as popular as it would become.
p49
aVBecause tastemakers like Jimmy Kimmel
p50
aVintroduce us to new and interesting things
p51
aVand bring them to a larger audience.
p52
aa(lp53
V(Video) Rebecca Black: \u266b It's Friday, Friday. Gotta get down on Friday. \u266b
p54
aV\u266b Everybody's looking forward to the weekend, weekend. \u266b
p55
aV\u266b Friday, Friday. Gettin' down on Friday. \u266b
p56
aa(lp57
VKA: So you didn't think that we could actually have this conversation
p58
aVwithout talking about this video I hope.
p59
aVRebecca Black's "Friday" is one of the most popular videos of the year.
p60
aVIt's been seen nearly 200 million times this year.
p61
aVThis is a chart of what it looked like.
p62
aVAnd similar to "Double Rainbow,"
p63
aVit seems to have just sprouted up out of nowhere.
p64
aa(lp65
VSo what happened on this day?
p66
aVWell it was a Friday, this is true.
p67
aVAnd if you're wondering about those other spikes, those are also Fridays.
p68
aV(Laughter)
p69
aVBut what about this day,
p70
aVthis one particular Friday?
p71
aVWell Tosh.0 picked it up, a lot of blogs starting writing about.
p72
aVMichael J. Nelson from Mystery Science Theater
p73
aVwas one of the first people to post a joke about the video on Twitter.
p74
aVBut what's important is that an individual or a group of tastemakers
p75
aVtook a point of view
p76
aVand they shared that with a larger audience, accelerating the process.
p77
aa(lp78
VAnd so then this community formed
p79
aVof people who shared this big inside joke
p80
aVand they started talking about it and doing things with it.
p81
aVAnd now there are 10,000 parodies of "Friday" on YouTube.
p82
aVEven in the first seven days,
p83
aVthere was one parody for every other day of the week.
p84
aV(Laughter)
p85
aVUnlike the one-way entertainment of the 20th century,
p86
aVthis community participation
p87
aVis how we become a part of the phenomenon \u2014
p88
aVeither by spreading it or by doing something new with it.
p89
aa(lp90
V(Music)
p91
aa(lp92
VSo "Nyan Cat" is a looped animation
p93
aVwith looped music.
p94
aVIt's this, just like this.
p95
aVIt's been viewed nearly 50 million times this year.
p96
aVAnd if you think that that is weird,
p97
aVyou should know that there is a three-hour version of this
p98
aVthat's been viewed four million times.
p99
aV(Laughter)
p100
aVEven cats were watching this video.
p101
aV(Laughter)
p102
aVCats were watching other cats watch this video.
p103
aa(lp104
V(Laughter)
p105
aa(lp106
VBut what's important here
p107
aVis the creativity that it inspired
p108
aVamongst this techie, geeky Internet culture.
p109
aVThere were remixes.
p110
aV(Laughter)
p111
aVSomeone made an old timey version.
p112
aV(Laughter)
p113
aVAnd then it went international.
p114
aV(Laughter)
p115
aVAn entire remix community sprouted up
p116
aVthat brought it from being just a stupid joke
p117
aVto something that we can all actually be a part of.
p118
aVBecause we don't just enjoy now,
p119
aVwe participate.
p120
aa(lp121
VAnd who could have predicted any of this?
p122
aVWho could have predicted "Double Rainbow" or Rebecca Black
p123
aVor "Nyan Cat?"
p124
aVWhat scripts could you have written
p125
aVthat would have contained this in it?
p126
aVIn a world where over two days of video
p127
aVget uploaded every minute,
p128
aVonly that which is truly unique and unexpected
p129
aVcan stand out in the way that these things have.
p130
aVWhen a friend of mine told me that I needed to see this great video
p131
aVabout a guy protesting bicycle fines in New York City,
p132
aVI admit I wasn't very interested.
p133
aa(lp134
V(Video) Casey Niestat: So I got a ticket for not riding in the bike lane,
p135
aVbut often there are obstructions
p136
aVthat keep you from properly riding in the bike lane.
p137
aa(lp138
V(Laughter)
p139
aa(lp140
VKA: By being totally surprising and humorous,
p141
aVCasey Niestat got his funny idea and point
p142
aVseen five million times.
p143
aVAnd so this approach holds
p144
aVfor anything new that we do creatively.
p145
aVAnd so it all brings us
p146
aVto one big question ...
p147
aa(lp148
V(Video) Bear Vasquez: What does this mean?
p149
aVOhhhh.
p150
aV(Laughter)
p151
aa(lp152
VKA: What does it mean?
p153
aVTastemakers, creative participating communities,
p154
aVcomplete unexpectedness,
p155
aVthese are characteristics of a new kind of media and a new kind of culture
p156
aVwhere anyone has access
p157
aVand the audience defines the popularity.
p158
aVI mean, as mentioned earlier,
p159
aVone of the biggest stars in the world right now, Justin Bieber,
p160
aVgot his start on YouTube.
p161
aVNo one has to green-light your idea.
p162
aVAnd we all now feel some ownership
p163
aVin our own pop culture.
p164
aVAnd these are not characteristics of old media,
p165
aVand they're barely true of the media of today,
p166
aVbut they will define the entertainment of the future.
p167
aa(lp168
VThank you.
