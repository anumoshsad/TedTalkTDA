VThis is a talk about sugar and cancer.
p4
aVI became interested in sugar when I was in college.
p5
aVNot this kind of sugar.
p6
aVIt was the sugar that our biology professors taught us about
p7
aVin the context of the coating of your cells.
p8
aVMaybe you didn't know that your cells are coated with sugar.
p9
aVAnd I didn't know that, either,
p10
aVuntil I took these courses in college,
p11
aVbut back then \u2014
p12
aVand this was in, let's just call it the 1980s \u2014
p13
aVpeople didn't know much about why our cells are coated with sugar.
p14
aVAnd when I dug through my notes, what I noticed I had written down
p15
aVis that the sugar coating on our cells is like the sugar coating
p16
aVon a peanut M and M.
p17
aVAnd people thought the sugar coating on our cells
p18
aVwas like a protective coating
p19
aVthat somehow made our cells stronger or tougher.
p20
aa(lp21
VBut we now know, many decades later,
p22
aVthat it's much more complicated than that,
p23
aVand that the sugars on our cells are actually very complex.
p24
aVAnd if you could shrink yourself down to a little miniature airplane
p25
aVand fly right along the surface of your cells,
p26
aVit might look something like this \u2014
p27
aVwith geographical features.
p28
aVAnd now, the complex sugars are these trees and bushes \u2014
p29
aVweeping willows that are swaying in the wind
p30
aVand moving with the waves.
p31
aVAnd when I started thinking about all these complex sugars
p32
aVthat are like this foliage on our cells,
p33
aVit became one of the most interesting problems that I encountered
p34
aVas a biologist and also as a chemist.
p35
aVAnd so now we tend to think about the sugars
p36
aVthat are populating the surface of our cells
p37
aVas a language.
p38
aVThey have a lot of information stored in their complex structures.
p39
aa(lp40
VBut what are they trying to tell us?
p41
aVI can tell you that we do know some information
p42
aVthat comes from these sugars,
p43
aVand it's turned out already to be incredibly important
p44
aVin the world of medicine.
p45
aa(lp46
VFor example, one thing your sugars are telling us
p47
aVis your blood type.
p48
aVSo your blood cells, your red blood cells, are coated with sugars,
p49
aVand the chemical structures of those sugars determine your blood type.
p50
aVSo for example, I know that I am blood type O.
p51
aVHow many people are also blood type O?
p52
aVPut your hands up.
p53
aVIt's a pretty common one,
p54
aVso when so few hands go up, either you're not paying attention
p55
aVor you don't know your blood type, and both of those are bad.
p56
aa(lp57
V(Laughter)
p58
aa(lp59
VBut for those of you who share the blood type O with me,
p60
aVwhat this means is that we have this chemical structure
p61
aVon the surface of our blood cells:
p62
aVthree simple sugars linked together to make a more complex sugar.
p63
aVAnd that, by definition, is blood type O.
p64
aa(lp65
VNow, how many people are blood type A?
p66
aVRight here.
p67
aVThat means you have an enzyme in your cells
p68
aVthat adds one more building block,
p69
aVthat red sugar,
p70
aVto build a more complex structure.
p71
aVAnd how many people are blood type B?
p72
aVQuite a few.
p73
aVYou have a slightly different enzyme than the A people,
p74
aVso you build a slightly different structure,
p75
aVand those of you that are AB
p76
aVhave the enzyme from your mother, the other enzyme from your father,
p77
aVand now you make both of these structures in roughly equal proportions.
p78
aVAnd when this was figured out,
p79
aVwhich is now back in the previous century,
p80
aVthis enabled one of the most important medical procedures in the world,
p81
aVwhich, of course, is the blood transfusion.
p82
aVAnd by knowing what your blood type is,
p83
aVwe can make sure, if you ever need a transfusion,
p84
aVthat your donor has the same blood type,
p85
aVso that your body doesn't see foreign sugars,
p86
aVwhich it wouldn't like and would certainly reject.
p87
aa(lp88
VWhat else are the sugars on the surface of your cells trying to tell us?
p89
aVWell, those sugars might be telling us that you have cancer.
p90
aVSo a few decades ago,
p91
aVcorrelations began to emerge from the analysis of tumor tissue.
p92
aVAnd the typical scenario is a patient would have a tumor detected,
p93
aVand the tissue would be removed in a biopsy procedure
p94
aVand then sent down to a pathology lab
p95
aVwhere that tissue would be analyzed to look for chemical changes
p96
aVthat might inform the oncologist about the best course of treatment.
p97
aVAnd what was discovered from studies like that
p98
aVis that the sugars have changed
p99
aVwhen the cell transforms from being healthy to being sick.
p100
aVAnd those correlations have come up again and again and again.
p101
aVBut a big question in the field has been: Why?
p102
aVWhy do cancers have different sugars? What's the importance of that?
p103
aVWhy does it happen, and what can we do about it if it does turn out
p104
aVto be related to the disease process?
p105
aa(lp106
VSo, one of the changes that we study
p107
aVis an increase in the density of a particular sugar
p108
aVthat's called sialic acid.
p109
aVAnd I think this is going to be one of the most important sugars
p110
aVof our times,
p111
aVso I would encourage everybody to get familiar with this word.
p112
aVSialic acid is not the kind of sugar that we eat.
p113
aVThose are different sugars.
p114
aVThis is a kind of sugar that is actually found
p115
aVat certain levels on all of the cells in your body.
p116
aVIt's actually quite common on your cells.
p117
aVBut for some reason,
p118
aVcancer cells, at least in a successful, progressive disease,
p119
aVtend to have more sialic acid
p120
aVthan a normal, healthy cell would have.
p121
aVAnd why?
p122
aVWhat does that mean?
p123
aVWell, what we've learned
p124
aVis that it has to do with your immune system.
p125
aa(lp126
VSo let me tell you a little bit about the importance of your immune system
p127
aVin cancer.
p128
aVAnd this is something that's, I think, in the news a lot these days.
p129
aVYou know, people are starting to become familiar with the term
p130
aV"cancer immune therapy."
p131
aVAnd some of you might even know people
p132
aVwho are benefiting from these very new ways of treating cancer.
p133
aVWhat we now know is that your immune cells,
p134
aVwhich are the white blood cells coursing through your bloodstream,
p135
aVprotect you on a daily basis from things gone bad \u2014
p136
aVincluding cancer.
p137
aVAnd so in this picture,
p138
aVthose little green balls are your immune cells,
p139
aVand that big pink cell is a cancer cell.
p140
aVAnd these immune cells go around and taste all the cells in your body.
p141
aVThat's their job.
p142
aVAnd most of the time, the cells taste OK.
p143
aa(lp144
VBut once in a while, a cell might taste bad.
p145
aVHopefully, that's the cancer cell,
p146
aVand when those immune cells get the bad taste,
p147
aVthey launch an all-out strike and kill those cells.
p148
aVSo we know that.
p149
aVWe also know that if you can potentiate that tasting,
p150
aVif you can encourage those immune cells to actually take a big old bite
p151
aVout of a cancer cell,
p152
aVyou get a better job protecting yourself from cancer every day
p153
aVand maybe even curing a cancer.
p154
aVAnd there are now a couple of drugs out there in the market
p155
aVthat are used to treat cancer patients
p156
aVthat act exactly by this process.
p157
aVThey activate the immune system
p158
aVso that the immune system can be more vigorous
p159
aVin protecting us from cancer.
p160
aa(lp161
VIn fact, one of those drugs
p162
aVmay well have spared President Jimmy Carter's life.
p163
aVDo you remember, President Carter had malignant melanoma
p164
aVthat had metastasized to his brain,
p165
aVand that diagnosis is one that is usually accompanied by numbers
p166
aVlike "months to live."
p167
aVBut he was treated with one of these new immune-stimulating drugs,
p168
aVand now his melanoma appears to be in remission,
p169
aVwhich is remarkable,
p170
aVconsidering the situation only a few years ago.
p171
aVIn fact, it's so remarkable
p172
aVthat provocative statements like this one:
p173
aV"Cancer is having a penicillin moment," people are saying,
p174
aVwith these new immune therapy drugs.
p175
aVI mean, that's an incredibly bold thing to say about a disease
p176
aVwhich we've been fighting for a long time
p177
aVand mostly losing the battle with.
p178
aVSo this is very exciting.
p179
aa(lp180
VNow what does this have to do with sugars?
p181
aVWell, I'll tell you what we've learned.
p182
aVWhen an immune cell snuggles up against a cancer cell to take a taste,
p183
aVit's looking for signs of disease,
p184
aVand if it finds those signs,
p185
aVthe cell gets activated and it launches a missile strike and kills the cell.
p186
aVBut if that cancer cell has a dense forest of that sugar, sialic acid,
p187
aVwell, it starts to taste pretty good.
p188
aVAnd there's a protein on immune cells that grabs the sialic acid,
p189
aVand if that protein gets held at that synapse
p190
aVbetween the immune cell and the cancer cell,
p191
aVit puts that immune cell to sleep.
p192
aVThe sialic acids are telling the immune cell,
p193
aV"Hey, this cell's all right. Nothing to see here, move along.
p194
aVLook somewhere else."
p195
aVSo in other words,
p196
aVas long as our cells are wearing a thick coat of sialic acid,
p197
aVthey look fabulous, right?
p198
aVIt's amazing.
p199
aVAnd what if you could strip off that coat
p200
aVand take that sugar away?
p201
aVWell, your immune system
p202
aVmight be able to see that cancer cell for what it really is:
p203
aVsomething that needs to be destroyed.
p204
aa(lp205
VAnd so this is what we're doing in my lab.
p206
aVWe're developing new medicines
p207
aVthat are basically cell-surface lawnmowers \u2014
p208
aVmolecules that go down to the surface of these cancer cells
p209
aVand just cut off those sialic acids,
p210
aVso that the immune system can reach its full potential
p211
aVin eliminating those cancer cells from our body.
p212
aa(lp213
VSo in closing,
p214
aVlet me just remind you again:
p215
aVyour cells are coated with sugars.
p216
aVThe sugars are telling cells around that cell
p217
aVwhether the cell is good or bad.
p218
aVAnd that's important,
p219
aVbecause our immune system needs to leave the good cells alone.
p220
aVOtherwise, we'd have autoimmune diseases.
p221
aVBut once in a while, cancers get the ability
p222
aVto express these new sugars.
p223
aVAnd now that we understand
p224
aVhow those sugars mesmerize the immune system,
p225
aVwe can come up with new medicines to wake up those immune cells,
p226
aVtell them, "Ignore the sugars, eat the cell
p227
aVand have a delicious snack, on cancer."
p228
