VSo I tried to do a small good thing for my wife.
p4
aVIt makes me to stand here,
p5
aVthe fame, the money I got out of it.
p6
aVSo what I did, I'd gone back to my early marriage days.
p7
aVWhat you did in the early marriage days,
p8
aVyou tried to impress your wife. I did the same.
p9
aVOn that occasion, I found my wife
p10
aVcarrying something like this.
p11
aVI saw. "What is that?" I asked.
p12
aVMy wife replied, "None of your business."
p13
aVThen, being her husband, I ran behind her
p14
aVand saw she had a nasty rag cloth.
p15
aVI don't even use that cloth to clean my two-wheeler.
p16
aVThen I understood this \u2014 adapting that unhygienic method
p17
aVto manage her period days.
p18
aa(lp19
VThen I immediately asked her, why are you [using] that unhygienic method?
p20
aVShe replied, I also know about [sanitary pads],
p21
aVbut myself and my sisters, if they start using that,
p22
aVwe have to cut our family milk budget.
p23
aVThen I was shocked. What is the connection between
p24
aVusing a sanitary pad and a milk budget?
p25
aVAnd it's called affordability.
p26
aVI tried to impress my new wife by offering her a packet of sanitary pads.
p27
aVI went to a local shop, I tried to buy her a sanitary pad packet.
p28
aVThat fellow looks left and right,
p29
aVand spreads a newspaper, rolls it into the newspaper,
p30
aVgives it to me like a banned item, something like that.
p31
aVI don't know why. I did not ask for a condom.
p32
aVThen I took that pad. I want to see that. What is inside it?
p33
aa(lp34
VThe very first time, at the age of 29,
p35
aVthat day I am touching the sanitary pad, first ever.
p36
aVI must know: How many of the guys here have touched a sanitary pad?
p37
aVThey are not going to touch that, because it's not your matter.
p38
aVThen I thought to myself, white substance, made of cotton \u2014
p39
aVoh my God, that guy is just using a penny value of raw material \u2014
p40
aVinside they are selling for pounds, dollars.
p41
aVWhy not make a local sanitary pad for my new wife?
p42
aVThat's how all this started, but after making a sanitary pad,
p43
aVwhere can I check it?
p44
aVIt's not like I can just check it in the lab.
p45
aVI need a woman volunteer. Where can I get one in India?
p46
aVEven in Bangalore you won't get [one], in India.
p47
aVSo only problem: the only available victim is my wife.
p48
aa(lp49
VThen I made a sanitary pad and handed it to Shanti \u2014 my wife's name is Shanti.
p50
aV"Close your eyes. Whatever I give,
p51
aVit will be not a diamond pendant
p52
aVnot a diamond ring, even a chocolate,
p53
aVI will give you a surprise with a lot of tinsel paper rolled up with it.
p54
aVClose your eyes."
p55
aVBecause I tried to make it intimate.
p56
aVBecause it's an arranged marriage, not a love marriage.
p57
aV(Laughter)
p58
aVSo one day she said, openly, I'm not going to support this research.
p59
aVThen other victims, they got into my sisters.
p60
aVBut even sisters, wives, they're not ready to support in the research.
p61
aVThat's why I am always jealous with the saints in India.
p62
aVThey are having a lot of women volunteers around them.
p63
aVWhy I am not getting [any]?
p64
aVYou know, without them even calling, they'll get a lot of women volunteers.
p65
aVThen I used, tried to use the medical college girls.
p66
aVThey also refused. Finally, I decide,
p67
aVuse sanitary pad myself.
p68
aVNow I am having a title like
p69
aVthe first man to set foot on the moon.
p70
aVArmstrong. Then Tenzing [and] Hillary, in Everest,
p71
aVlike that Muruganantham is the first man
p72
aVwore a sanitary pad across the globe.
p73
aa(lp74
VI wore a sanitary pad. I filled animal blood in a football bottle,
p75
aVI tied it up here, there is a tube going into my panties,
p76
aVwhile I'm walking, while I'm cycling, I made a press,
p77
aVdoses of blood will go there.
p78
aVThat makes me bow down to any woman in front of me
p79
aVto give full respect. That five days I'll never forget \u2014
p80
aVthe messy days, the lousy days, that wetness.
p81
aVMy God, it's unbelievable.
p82
aa(lp83
VBut here the problem is, one company is making napkin
p84
aVout of cotton. It is working well.
p85
aVBut I am also trying to make sanitary pad with the good cotton. It's not working.
p86
aVThat makes me to want to refuse to continue this research and research and research.
p87
aVYou need first funds.
p88
aVNot only financial crises, but because of the sanitary pad research,
p89
aVI come through all sorts of problems, including
p90
aVa divorce notice from my wife.
p91
aVWhy is this? I used medical college girls.
p92
aVShe suspects I am using as a trump card
p93
aVto run behind medical college girls.
p94
aVFinally, I came to know it is a special cellulose
p95
aVderived from a pinewood, but even after that,
p96
aVyou need a multimillion-dollar plant like this
p97
aVto process that material. Again, a stop-up.
p98
aVThen I spend another four years to create my own
p99
aVmachine tools, a simple machine tool like this.
p100
aVIn this machine, any rural woman can apply the same
p101
aVraw materials that they are processing in the multinational plant,
p102
aVanyone can make a world-class napkin at your dining hall.
p103
aVThat is my invention.
p104
aa(lp105
VSo after that, what I did,
p106
aVusually if anyone got a patent or an invention,
p107
aVimmediately you want to make, convert into this.
p108
aVI never did this. I dropped it just like this,
p109
aVbecause you do this, if anyone runs after money,
p110
aVtheir life will not [have] any beauty. It is boredom.
p111
aVA lot of people making a lot of money, billion,
p112
aVbillions of dollars accumulating.
p113
aVWhy are they coming for, finally, for philanthropy?
p114
aVWhy the need for accumulating money, then doing philanthropy?
p115
aVWhat if one decided to start philanthropy from the day one?
p116
aVThat's why I am giving this machine
p117
aVonly in rural India, for rural women, because in India,
p118
aV[you'll be] surprised, only two percent of women
p119
aVare using sanitary pads. The rest, they're using a rag cloth,
p120
aVa leaf, husk, [saw] dust, everything except sanitary pads.
p121
aVIt is the same in the 21st century. That's why I am going
p122
aVto decide to give this machine only for poor women across India.
p123
aVSo far, 630 installations happened in 23 states
p124
aVin six other countries.
p125
aa(lp126
VNow I'm on my seventh year sustaining against
p127
aVmultinational, transnational giants \u2014 makes all MBA students a question mark.
p128
aVA school dropout from Coimbatore, how he is able to sustaining?
p129
aVThat makes me a visiting professor and guest lecturer in all IIMs.
p130
aV(Applause)
p131
aVPlay video one.
p132
aa(lp133
V(Video) Arunachalam Muruganantham: The thing I saw in my wife's hand, "Why are you using that nasty cloth?"
p134
aVShe replied immediately, "I know about napkins, but if I start
p135
aVusing napkins, then we have to cut our family milk budget."
p136
aVWhy not make myself a low-cost napkin?
p137
aVSo I decided I'm going to sell this new machine
p138
aVonly for Women Self Help Groups.
p139
aVThat is my idea.
p140
aa(lp141
VAM: And previously, you need a multimillion investment
p142
aVfor machine and all. Now, any rural woman can.
p143
aVThey are performing puja.
p144
aV(Video): (Singing)
p145
aVYou just think, competing giants,
p146
aVeven from Harvard, Oxford, is difficult.
p147
aVI make a rural woman to compete with multinationals.
p148
aVI'm sustaining on seventh year.
p149
aVAlready 600 installations. What is my mission?
p150
aVI'm going to make India
p151
aV[into] a 100-percent-sanitary-napkin-using country in my lifetime.
p152
aVIn this way I'm going to provide not less than a million
p153
aVrural employment that I'm going to create.
p154
aVThat's why I'm not running after this bloody money.
p155
aVI'm doing something serious.
p156
aVIf you chase a girl, the girl won't like you.
p157
aVDo your job simply, the girl will chase you.
p158
aVLike that, I never chased Mahalakshmi.
p159
aVMahalakshmi is chasing me, I am keeping in the back pocket.
p160
aVNot in front pocket. I'm a back pocket man.
p161
aVThat's all. A school dropout saw your problem in the society
p162
aVof not using sanitary pad.
p163
aVI am becoming a solution provider. I'm very happy.
p164
aVI don't want to make this as a corporate entity.
p165
aVI want to make this as a local sanitary pad movement
p166
aVacross the globe. That's why I put all the details
p167
aVon public domain like an open software.
p168
aVNow 110 countries are accessing it. Okay?
p169
aVSo I classify the people into three:
p170
aVuneducated, little educated, surplus educated.
p171
aVLittle educated, done this. Surplus educated,
p172
aVwhat are you going to do for the society?
p173
aa(lp174
VThank you very much. Bye!
