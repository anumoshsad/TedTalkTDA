VEvery day, I listen to harrowing stories of people fleeing for their lives,
p4
aVacross dangerous borders and unfriendly seas.
p5
aVBut there's one story that keeps me awake at night,
p6
aVand it's about Doaa.
p7
aa(lp8
VA Syrian refugee, 19 years old,
p9
aVshe was living a grinding existence in Egypt working day wages.
p10
aVHer dad was constantly thinking of his thriving business back in Syria
p11
aVthat had been blown to pieces by a bomb.
p12
aVAnd the war that drove them there was still raging in its fourth year.
p13
aVAnd the community that once welcomed them there
p14
aVhad become weary of them.
p15
aVAnd one day, men on motorcycles tried to kidnap her.
p16
aVOnce an aspiring student thinking only of her future,
p17
aVnow she was scared all the time.
p18
aa(lp19
VBut she was also full of hope,
p20
aVbecause she was in love with a fellow Syrian refugee named Bassem.
p21
aVBassem was also struggling in Egypt, and he said to Doaa,
p22
aV"Let's go to Europe; seek asylum, safety.
p23
aVI will work, you can study \u2014 the promise of a new life."
p24
aVAnd he asked her father for her hand in marriage.
p25
aa(lp26
VBut they knew to get to Europe they had to risk their lives,
p27
aVtraveling across the Mediterranean Sea,
p28
aVputting their hands in smugglers', notorious for their cruelty.
p29
aVAnd Doaa was terrified of the water.
p30
aVShe always had been. She never learned to swim.
p31
aa(lp32
VIt was August that year, and already 2,000 people had died
p33
aVtrying to cross the Mediterranean,
p34
aVbut Doaa knew of a friend who had made it all the way to Northern Europe,
p35
aVand she thought, "Maybe we can, too."
p36
aVSo she asked her parents if they could go,
p37
aVand after a painful discussion, they consented,
p38
aVand Bassem paid his entire life savings \u2014 2,500 dollars each \u2014
p39
aVto the smugglers.
p40
aa(lp41
VIt was a Saturday morning when the call came,
p42
aVand they were taken by bus to a beach, hundreds of people on the beach.
p43
aVThey were taken then by small boats onto an old fishing boat,
p44
aV500 of them crammed onto that boat,
p45
aV300 below, [200] above.
p46
aVThere were Syrians, Palestinians, Africans, Muslims and Christians,
p47
aV100 children, including Sandra \u2014 little Sandra, six years old \u2014
p48
aVand Masa, 18 months.
p49
aVThere were families on that boat, crammed together shoulder to shoulder,
p50
aVfeet to feet.
p51
aVDoaa was sitting with her legs crammed up to her chest,
p52
aVBassem holding her hand.
p53
aa(lp54
VDay two on the water, they were sick with worry
p55
aVand sick to their stomachs from the rough sea.
p56
aa(lp57
VDay three, Doaa had a premonition.
p58
aVAnd she said to Bassem, "I fear we're not going to make it.
p59
aVI fear the boat is going to sink."
p60
aVAnd Bassem said to her, "Please be patient.
p61
aVWe will make it to Sweden, we will get married
p62
aVand we will have a future."
p63
aa(lp64
VDay four, the passengers were getting agitated.
p65
aVThey asked the captain, "When will we get there?"
p66
aVHe told them to shut up, and he insulted them.
p67
aVHe said, "In 16 hours we will reach the shores of Italy."
p68
aVThey were weak and weary.
p69
aVSoon they saw a boat approach \u2014 a smaller boat, 10 men on board,
p70
aVwho started shouting at them, hurling insults,
p71
aVthrowing sticks, asking them to all disembark
p72
aVand get on this smaller, more unseaworthy boat.
p73
aVThe parents were terrified for their children,
p74
aVand they collectively refused to disembark.
p75
aVSo the boat sped away in anger,
p76
aVand a half an hour later, came back
p77
aVand started deliberately ramming a hole in the side of Doaa's boat,
p78
aVjust below where she and Bassem were sitting.
p79
aVAnd she heard how they yelled,
p80
aV"Let the fish eat your flesh!"
p81
aVAnd they started laughing as the boat capsized and sank.
p82
aa(lp83
VThe 300 people below deck were doomed.
p84
aVDoaa was holding on to the side of the boat as it sank,
p85
aVand watched in horror as a small child was cut to pieces by the propeller.
p86
aVBassem said to her, "Please let go,
p87
aVor you'll be swept in and the propeller will kill you, too."
p88
aVAnd remember \u2014 she can't swim.
p89
aVBut she let go and she started moving her arms and her legs,
p90
aVthinking, "This is swimming."
p91
aVAnd miraculously, Bassem found a life ring.
p92
aVIt was one of those child's rings
p93
aVthat they use to play in swimming pools and on calm seas.
p94
aVAnd Doaa climbed onto the ring,
p95
aVher arms and her legs dangling by the side.
p96
aVBassem was a good swimmer,
p97
aVso he held her hand and tread water.
p98
aVAround them there were corpses.
p99
aVAround 100 people survived initially,
p100
aVand they started coming together in groups, praying for rescue.
p101
aVBut when a day went by and no one came,
p102
aVsome people gave up hope,
p103
aVand Doaa and Bassem watched
p104
aVas men in the distance took their life vests off and sank into the water.
p105
aa(lp106
VOne man approached them with a small baby perched on his shoulder,
p107
aVnine months old \u2014 Malek.
p108
aVHe was holding onto a gas canister to stay afloat, and he said to them,
p109
aV"I fear I am not going to survive.
p110
aVI'm too weak. I don't have the courage anymore."
p111
aVAnd he handed little Malek over to Bassem and to Doaa,
p112
aVand they perched her onto the life ring.
p113
aVSo now they were three, Doaa, Bassem and little Malek.
p114
aa(lp115
VAnd let me take a pause in this story right here
p116
aVand ask the question:
p117
aVwhy do refugees like Doaa take these kinds of risks?
p118
aVMillions of refugees are living in exile, in limbo.
p119
aVThey're living in countries [fleeing] from a war that has been raging
p120
aVfor four years.
p121
aVEven if they wanted to return, they can't.
p122
aVTheir homes, their businesses,
p123
aVtheir towns and their cities have been completely destroyed.
p124
aVThis is a UNESCO World Heritage City,
p125
aVHoms, in Syria.
p126
aVSo people continue to flee into neighboring countries,
p127
aVand we build refugee camps for them in the desert.
p128
aVHundreds of thousands of people live in camps like these,
p129
aVand thousands and thousands more, millions, live in towns and cities.
p130
aVAnd the communities,
p131
aVthe neighboring countries that once welcomed them
p132
aVwith open arms and hearts
p133
aVare overwhelmed.
p134
aVThere are simply not enough schools, water systems, sanitation.
p135
aVEven rich European countries could never handle such an influx
p136
aVwithout massive investment.
p137
aVThe Syria war has driven almost four million people over the borders,
p138
aVbut over seven million people are on the run inside the country.
p139
aVThat means that over half the Syrian population
p140
aVhas been forced to flee.
p141
aVBack to those neighboring countries hosting so many.
p142
aVThey feel that the richer world has done too little to support them.
p143
aVAnd days have turned into months, months into years.
p144
aVA refugee's stay is supposed to be temporary.
p145
aa(lp146
VBack to Doaa and Bassem in the water.
p147
aVIt was their second day, and Bassem was getting very weak.
p148
aVAnd now it was Doaa's turn to say to Bassem,
p149
aV"My love, please hold on to hope, to our future. We will make it."
p150
aVAnd he said to her,
p151
aV"I'm sorry, my love, that I put you in this situation.
p152
aVI have never loved anyone as much as I love you."
p153
aVAnd he released himself into the water,
p154
aVand Doaa watched as the love of her life drowned before her eyes.
p155
aa(lp156
VLater that day,
p157
aVa mother came up to Doaa with her small 18-month-old daughter, Masa.
p158
aVThis was the little girl I showed you in the picture earlier,
p159
aVwith the life vests.
p160
aVHer older sister Sandra had just drowned,
p161
aVand her mother knew she had to do everything in her power
p162
aVto save her daughter.
p163
aVAnd she said to Doaa, "Please take this child.
p164
aVLet her be part of you. I will not survive."
p165
aVAnd then she went away and drowned.
p166
aa(lp167
VSo Doaa, the 19-year-old refugee who was terrified of the water,
p168
aVwho couldn't swim,
p169
aVfound herself in charge of two little baby kids.
p170
aVAnd they were thirsty and they were hungry and they were agitated,
p171
aVand she tried her best to amuse them,
p172
aVto sing to them, to say words to them from the Quran.
p173
aVAround them, the bodies were bloating and turning black.
p174
aVThe sun was blazing during the day.
p175
aVAt night, there was a cold moon and fog.
p176
aVIt was very frightening.
p177
aVOn the fourth day in the water, this is how Doaa probably looked
p178
aVon the ring with her two children.
p179
aa(lp180
VA woman came on the fourth day and approached her
p181
aVand asked her to take another child \u2014
p182
aVa little boy, just four years old.
p183
aVWhen Doaa took the little boy and the mother drowned,
p184
aVshe said to the sobbing child,
p185
aV"She just went away to find you water and food."
p186
aVBut his heart soon stopped,
p187
aVand Doaa had to release the little boy into the water.
p188
aa(lp189
VLater that day,
p190
aVshe looked up into the sky with hope,
p191
aVbecause she saw two planes crossing in the sky.
p192
aVAnd she waved her arms, hoping they would see her,
p193
aVbut the planes were soon gone.
p194
aa(lp195
VBut that afternoon, as the sun was going down,
p196
aVshe saw a boat, a merchant vessel.
p197
aVAnd she said, "Please, God, let them rescue me."
p198
aVShe waved her arms and she felt like she shouted for about two hours.
p199
aVAnd it had become dark, but finally the searchlights found her
p200
aVand they extended a rope,
p201
aVastonished to see a woman clutching onto two babies.
p202
aa(lp203
VThey pulled them onto the boat, they got oxygen and blankets,
p204
aVand a Greek helicopter came to pick them up
p205
aVand take them to the island of Crete.
p206
aa(lp207
VBut Doaa looked down and asked, "What of Malek?"
p208
aVAnd they told her the little baby did not survive \u2014
p209
aVshe drew her last breath in the boat's clinic.
p210
aVBut Doaa was sure that as they had been pulled up onto the rescue boat,
p211
aVthat little baby girl had been smiling.
p212
aa(lp213
VOnly 11 people survived that wreck, of the 500.
p214
aVThere was never an international investigation into what happened.
p215
aVThere were some media reports about mass murder at sea,
p216
aVa terrible tragedy,
p217
aVbut that was only for one day.
p218
aVAnd then the news cycle moved on.
p219
aa(lp220
VMeanwhile, in a pediatric hospital on Crete,
p221
aVlittle Masa was on the edge of death.
p222
aVShe was really dehydrated. Her kidneys were failing.
p223
aVHer glucose levels were dangerously low.
p224
aVThe doctors did everything in their medical power to save them,
p225
aVand the Greek nurses never left her side,
p226
aVholding her, hugging her, singing her words.
p227
aVMy colleagues also visited and said pretty words to her in Arabic.
p228
aVAmazingly, little Masa survived.
p229
aa(lp230
VAnd soon the Greek press started reporting about the miracle baby,
p231
aVwho had survived four days in the water without food or anything to drink,
p232
aVand offers to adopt her came from all over the country.
p233
aa(lp234
VAnd meanwhile, Doaa was in another hospital on Crete,
p235
aVthin, dehydrated.
p236
aVAn Egyptian family took her into their home as soon as she was released.
p237
aVAnd soon word went around about Doaa's survival,
p238
aVand a phone number was published on Facebook.
p239
aVMessages started coming in.
p240
aa(lp241
V"Doaa, do you know what happened to my brother?
p242
aVMy sister? My parents? My friends? Do you know if they survived?"
p243
aa(lp244
VOne of those messages said,
p245
aV"I believe you saved my little niece, Masa."
p246
aVAnd it had this photo.
p247
aVThis was from Masa's uncle,
p248
aVa Syrian refugee who had made it to Sweden with his family
p249
aVand also Masa's older sister.
p250
aVSoon, we hope, Masa will be reunited with him in Sweden,
p251
aVand until then, she's being cared for in a beautiful orphanage in Athens.
p252
aa(lp253
VAnd Doaa? Well, word went around about her survival, too.
p254
aVAnd the media wrote about this slight woman,
p255
aVand couldn't imagine how she could survive all this time
p256
aVunder such conditions in that sea,
p257
aVand still save another life.
p258
aVThe Academy of Athens, one of Greece's most prestigious institutions,
p259
aVgave her an award of bravery,
p260
aVand she deserves all that praise,
p261
aVand she deserves a second chance.
p262
aVBut she wants to still go to Sweden.
p263
aVShe wants to reunite with her family there.
p264
aVShe wants to bring her mother and her father and her younger siblings
p265
aVaway from Egypt there as well,
p266
aVand I believe she will succeed.
p267
aVShe wants to become a lawyer or a politician
p268
aVor something that can help fight injustice.
p269
aVShe is an extraordinary survivor.
p270
aa(lp271
VBut I have to ask:
p272
aVwhat if she didn't have to take that risk?
p273
aVWhy did she have to go through all that?
p274
aVWhy wasn't there a legal way for her to study in Europe?
p275
aVWhy couldn't Masa have taken an airplane to Sweden?
p276
aVWhy couldn't Bassem have found work?
p277
aVWhy is there no massive resettlement program for Syrian refugees,
p278
aVthe victims of the worst war of our times?
p279
aVThe world did this for the Vietnamese in the 1970s. Why not now?
p280
aVWhy is there so little investment in the neighboring countries
p281
aVhosting so many refugees?
p282
aVAnd why, the root question,
p283
aVis so little being done to stop the wars, the persecution
p284
aVand the poverty that is driving so many people
p285
aVto the shores of Europe?
p286
aVUntil these issues are resolved,
p287
aVpeople will continue to take to the seas
p288
aVand to seek safety and asylum.
p289
aa(lp290
VAnd what happens next?
p291
aVWell, that is largely Europe's choice.
p292
aVAnd I understand the public fears.
p293
aVPeople are worried about their security, their economies, the changes of culture.
p294
aVBut is that more important than saving human lives?
p295
aVBecause there is something fundamental here
p296
aVthat I think overrides the rest,
p297
aVand it is about our common humanity.
p298
aVNo person fleeing war or persecution
p299
aVshould have to die crossing a sea to reach safety.
p300
aa(lp301
V(Applause)
p302
aa(lp303
VOne thing is for sure,
p304
aVthat no refugee would be on those dangerous boats
p305
aVif they could thrive where they are.
p306
aVAnd no migrant would take that dangerous journey
p307
aVif they had enough food for themselves and their children.
p308
aVAnd no one would put their life savings
p309
aVin the hands of those notorious smugglers
p310
aVif there was a legal way to migrate.
p311
aa(lp312
VSo on behalf of little Masa
p313
aVand on behalf of Doaa
p314
aVand of Bassem
p315
aVand of those 500 people who drowned with them,
p316
aVcan we make sure that they did not die in vain?
p317
aVCould we be inspired by what happened,
p318
aVand take a stand for a world in which every life matters?
p319
aa(lp320
VThank you.
