VIn the year 1919,
p4
aVa virtually unknown German mathematician, named Theodor Kaluza
p5
aVsuggested a very bold and, in some ways, a very bizarre idea.
p6
aVHe proposed that our universe
p7
aVmight actually have more than the three dimensions
p8
aVthat we are all aware of.
p9
aVThat is in addition to left, right, back, forth and up, down,
p10
aVKaluza proposed that there might be additional dimensions of space
p11
aVthat for some reason we don't yet see.
p12
aVNow, when someone makes a bold and bizarre idea,
p13
aVsometimes that's all it is \u2014 bold and bizarre,
p14
aVbut it has nothing to do with the world around us.
p15
aVThis particular idea, however \u2014
p16
aValthough we don't yet know whether it's right or wrong,
p17
aVand at the end I'll discuss experiments which, in the next few years,
p18
aVmay tell us whether it's right or wrong \u2014
p19
aVthis idea has had a major impact on physics in the last century
p20
aVand continues to inform a lot of cutting-edge research.
p21
aa(lp22
VSo, I'd like to tell you something about the story of these extra dimensions.
p23
aVSo where do we go?
p24
aVTo begin we need a little bit of back story. Go to 1907.
p25
aVThis is a year when Einstein is basking in the glow
p26
aVof having discovered the special theory of relativity
p27
aVand decides to take on a new project,
p28
aVto try to understand fully the grand, pervasive force of gravity.
p29
aVAnd in that moment, there are many people around
p30
aVwho thought that that project had already been resolved.
p31
aVNewton had given the world a theory of gravity in the late 1600s
p32
aVthat works well, describes the motion of planets,
p33
aVthe motion of the moon and so forth,
p34
aVthe motion of apocryphal of apples falling from trees,
p35
aVhitting people on the head.
p36
aVAll of that could be described using Newton's work.
p37
aa(lp38
VBut Einstein realized that Newton had left something out of the story,
p39
aVbecause even Newton had written
p40
aVthat although he understood how to calculate the effect of gravity,
p41
aVhe'd been unable to figure out how it really works.
p42
aVHow is it that the Sun, 93 million miles away,
p43
aV[that] somehow it affects the motion of the Earth?
p44
aVHow does the Sun reach out across empty inert space and exert influence?
p45
aVAnd that is a task to which Einstein set himself \u2014
p46
aVto figure out how gravity works.
p47
aVAnd let me show you what it is that he found.
p48
aVSo Einstein found
p49
aVthat the medium that transmits gravity is space itself.
p50
aVThe idea goes like this:
p51
aVimagine space is a substrate of all there is.
p52
aa(lp53
VEinstein said space is nice and flat, if there's no matter present.
p54
aVBut if there is matter in the environment, such as the Sun,
p55
aVit causes the fabric of space to warp, to curve.
p56
aVAnd that communicates the force of gravity.
p57
aVEven the Earth warps space around it.
p58
aVNow look at the Moon.
p59
aVThe Moon is kept in orbit, according to these ideas,
p60
aVbecause it rolls along a valley in the curved environment
p61
aVthat the Sun and the Moon and the Earth can all create by virtue of their presence.
p62
aVWe go to a full-frame view of this.
p63
aVThe Earth itself is kept in orbit
p64
aVbecause it rolls along a valley in the environment that's curved
p65
aVbecause of the Sun's presence.
p66
aVThat is this new idea about how gravity actually works.
p67
aa(lp68
VNow, this idea was tested in 1919 through astronomical observations.
p69
aVIt really works. It describes the data.
p70
aVAnd this gained Einstein prominence around the world.
p71
aVAnd that is what got Kaluza thinking.
p72
aVHe, like Einstein, was in search of what we call a unified theory.
p73
aVThat's one theory
p74
aVthat might be able to describe all of nature's forces from one set of ideas,
p75
aVone set of principles, one master equation, if you will.
p76
aVSo Kaluza said to himself,
p77
aVEinstein has been able to describe gravity
p78
aVin terms of warps and curves in space \u2014
p79
aVin fact, space and time, to be more precise.
p80
aVMaybe I can play the same game with the other known force,
p81
aVwhich was, at that time, known as the electromagnetic force \u2014
p82
aVwe know of others today, but at that time
p83
aVthat was the only other one people were thinking about.
p84
aVYou know, the force responsible for electricity
p85
aVand magnetic attraction and so forth.
p86
aa(lp87
VSo Kaluza says, maybe I can play the same game
p88
aVand describe electromagnetic force in terms of warps and curves.
p89
aVThat raised a question: warps and curves in what?
p90
aVEinstein had already used up space and time,
p91
aVwarps and curves, to describe gravity.
p92
aVThere didn't seem to be anything else to warp or curve.
p93
aVSo Kaluza said, well, maybe there are more dimensions of space.
p94
aVHe said, if I want to describe one more force,
p95
aVmaybe I need one more dimension.
p96
aVSo he imagined that the world had four dimensions of space, not three,
p97
aVand imagined that electromagnetism was warps and curves
p98
aVin that fourth dimension. Now here's the thing:
p99
aVwhen he wrote down the equations describing warps and curves
p100
aVin a universe with four space dimensions, not three,
p101
aVhe found the old equations that Einstein had already derived in three dimensions \u2014
p102
aVthose were for gravity \u2014
p103
aVbut he found one more equation because of the one more dimension.
p104
aVAnd when he looked at that equation,
p105
aVit was none other than the equation
p106
aVthat scientists had long known to describe the electromagnetic force.
p107
aVAmazing \u2014 it just popped out.
p108
aVHe was so excited by this realization
p109
aVthat he ran around his house screaming, "Victory!" \u2014
p110
aVthat he had found the unified theory.
p111
aa(lp112
VNow clearly, Kaluza was a man who took theory very seriously.
p113
aVHe, in fact \u2014
p114
aVthere is a story that when he wanted to learn how to swim,
p115
aVhe read a book, a treatise on swimming \u2014
p116
aV(Laughter)
p117
aV\u2014 then dove into the ocean.
p118
aVThis is a man who would risk his life on theory.
p119
aVNow, but for those of us who are a little bit more practically minded,
p120
aVtwo questions immediately arise from his observation.
p121
aVNumber one: if there are more dimensions in space, where are they?
p122
aVWe don't seem to see them.
p123
aVAnd number two: does this theory really work in detail,
p124
aVwhen you try to apply it to the world around us?
p125
aVNow, the first question was answered in 1926
p126
aVby a fellow named Oskar Klein.
p127
aVHe suggested that dimensions might come in two varieties \u2014
p128
aVthere might be big, easy-to-see dimensions,
p129
aVbut there might also be tiny, curled-up dimensions,
p130
aVcurled up so small, even though they're all around us,
p131
aVthat we don't see them.
p132
aa(lp133
VLet me show you that one visually.
p134
aVSo, imagine you're looking at something
p135
aVlike a cable supporting a traffic light.
p136
aVIt's in Manhattan. You're in Central Park \u2014 it's kind of irrelevant \u2014
p137
aVbut the cable looks one-dimensional from a distant viewpoint,
p138
aVbut you and I all know that it does have some thickness.
p139
aVIt's very hard to see it, though, from far away.
p140
aVBut if we zoom in and take the perspective of, say,
p141
aVa little ant walking around \u2014
p142
aVlittle ants are so small that they can access all of the dimensions \u2014
p143
aVthe long dimension,
p144
aVbut also this clockwise, counter-clockwise direction.
p145
aVAnd I hope you appreciate this.
p146
aVIt took so long to get these ants to do this.
p147
aa(lp148
V(Laughter)
p149
aa(lp150
VBut this illustrates the fact that dimensions can be of two sorts:
p151
aVbig and small. And the idea that maybe the big dimensions around us
p152
aVare the ones that we can easily see,
p153
aVbut there might be additional dimensions curled up,
p154
aVsort of like the circular part of that cable,
p155
aVso small that they have so far remained invisible.
p156
aVLet me show you what that would look like.
p157
aVSo, if we take a look, say, at space itself \u2014
p158
aVI can only show, of course, two dimensions on a screen.
p159
aVSome of you guys will fix that one day,
p160
aVbut anything that's not flat on a screen is a new dimension,
p161
aVgoes smaller, smaller, smaller,
p162
aVand way down in the microscopic depths of space itself,
p163
aVthis is the idea,
p164
aVyou could have additional curled up dimensions \u2014
p165
aa(lp166
Vhere is a little shape of a circle \u2014 so small that we don't see them.
p167
aVBut if you were a little ultra microscopic ant walking around,
p168
aVyou could walk in the big dimensions that we all know about \u2014
p169
aVthat's like the grid part \u2014
p170
aVbut you could also access the tiny curled-up dimension
p171
aVthat's so small that we can't see it with the naked eye
p172
aVor even with any of our most refined equipment.
p173
aVBut deeply tucked into the fabric of space itself,
p174
aVthe idea is there could be more dimensions, as we see there.
p175
aVNow that's an explanation
p176
aVabout how the universe could have more dimensions than the ones that we see.
p177
aVBut what about the second question that I asked:
p178
aVdoes the theory actually work
p179
aVwhen you try to apply it to the real world?
p180
aa(lp181
VWell, it turns out that Einstein and Kaluza and many others
p182
aVworked on trying to refine this framework
p183
aVand apply it to the physics of the universe
p184
aVas was understood at the time, and, in detail, it didn't work.
p185
aVIn detail, for instance,
p186
aVthey couldn't get the mass of the electron
p187
aVto work out correctly in this theory.
p188
aVSo many people worked on it, but by the '40s, certainly by the '50s,
p189
aVthis strange but very compelling idea
p190
aVof how to unify the laws of physics had gone away.
p191
aVUntil something wonderful happened in our age.
p192
aVIn our era, a new approach to unify the laws of physics
p193
aVis being pursued by physicists such as myself,
p194
aVmany others around the world,
p195
aVit's called superstring theory, as you were indicating.
p196
aVAnd the wonderful thing is that superstring theory
p197
aVhas nothing to do at first sight with this idea of extra dimensions,
p198
aVbut when we study superstring theory,
p199
aVwe find that it resurrects the idea in a sparkling, new form.
p200
aa(lp201
VSo, let me just tell you how that goes.
p202
aVSuperstring theory \u2014 what is it?
p203
aVWell, it's a theory that tries to answer the question:
p204
aVwhat are the basic, fundamental, indivisible, uncuttable constituents
p205
aVmaking up everything in the world around us?
p206
aVThe idea is like this.
p207
aVSo, imagine we look at a familiar object, just a candle in a holder,
p208
aVand imagine that we want to figure out what it is made of.
p209
aVSo we go on a journey deep inside the object and examine the constituents.
p210
aVSo deep inside \u2014 we all know, you go sufficiently far down, you have atoms.
p211
aVWe also all know that atoms are not the end of the story.
p212
aVThey have little electrons that swarm around a central nucleus
p213
aVwith neutrons and protons.
p214
aVEven the neutrons and protons have smaller particles inside of them known as quarks.
p215
aVThat is where conventional ideas stop.
p216
aa(lp217
VHere is the new idea of string theory.
p218
aVDeep inside any of these particles, there is something else.
p219
aVThis something else is this dancing filament of energy.
p220
aVIt looks like a vibrating string \u2014
p221
aVthat's where the idea, string theory comes from.
p222
aVAnd just like the vibrating strings that you just saw in a cello
p223
aVcan vibrate in different patterns,
p224
aVthese can also vibrate in different patterns.
p225
aVThey don't produce different musical notes.
p226
aVRather, they produce the different particles making up the world around us.
p227
aVSo if these ideas are correct,
p228
aVthis is what the ultra-microscopic landscape of the universe looks like.
p229
aVIt's built up of a huge number
p230
aVof these little tiny filaments of vibrating energy,
p231
aVvibrating in different frequencies.
p232
aVThe different frequencies produce the different particles.
p233
aVThe different particles are responsible
p234
aVfor all the richness in the world around us.
p235
aa(lp236
VAnd there you see unification,
p237
aVbecause matter particles, electrons and quarks,
p238
aVradiation particles, photons, gravitons, are all built up from one entity.
p239
aVSo matter and the forces of nature all are put together
p240
aVunder the rubric of vibrating strings.
p241
aVAnd that's what we mean by a unified theory.
p242
aVNow here is the catch.
p243
aVWhen you study the mathematics of string theory,
p244
aVyou find that it doesn't work
p245
aVin a universe that just has three dimensions of space.
p246
aVIt doesn't work in a universe with four dimensions of space, nor five, nor six.
p247
aVFinally, you can study the equations, and show that it works
p248
aVonly in a universe that has 10 dimensions of space
p249
aVand one dimension of time.
p250
aVIt leads us right back to this idea of Kaluza and Klein \u2014
p251
aVthat our world, when appropriately described,
p252
aVhas more dimensions than the ones that we see.
p253
aa(lp254
VNow you might think about that and say, well,
p255
aVOK, you know, if you have extra dimensions, and they're really tightly curled up,
p256
aVyeah, perhaps we won't see them, if they're small enough.
p257
aVBut if there's a little tiny civilization of green people walking around down there,
p258
aVand you make them small enough, and we won't see them either. That is true.
p259
aVOne of the other predictions of string theory \u2014
p260
aVno, that's not one of the other predictions of string theory.
p261
aa(lp262
V(Laughter)
p263
aa(lp264
VBut it raises the question:
p265
aVare we just trying to hide away these extra dimensions,
p266
aVor do they tell us something about the world?
p267
aVIn the remaining time, I'd like to tell you two features of them.
p268
aVFirst is, many of us believe that these extra dimensions
p269
aVhold the answer to what perhaps is the deepest question
p270
aVin theoretical physics, theoretical science.
p271
aVAnd that question is this: when we look around the world,
p272
aVas scientists have done for the last hundred years,
p273
aVthere appear to be about 20 numbers that really describe our universe.
p274
aVThese are numbers like the mass of the particles,
p275
aVlike electrons and quarks, the strength of gravity,
p276
aVthe strength of the electromagnetic force \u2014
p277
aVa list of about 20 numbers
p278
aVthat have been measured with incredible precision,
p279
aVbut nobody has an explanation
p280
aVfor why the numbers have the particular values that they do.
p281
aa(lp282
VNow, does string theory offer an answer?
p283
aVNot yet.
p284
aVBut we believe the answer for why those numbers have the values they do
p285
aVmay rely on the form of the extra dimensions.
p286
aVAnd the wonderful thing is, if those numbers
p287
aVhad any other values than the known ones,
p288
aVthe universe, as we know it, wouldn't exist.
p289
aVThis is a deep question.
p290
aVWhy are those numbers so finely tuned
p291
aVto allow stars to shine and planets to form,
p292
aVwhen we recognize that if you fiddle with those numbers \u2014
p293
aVif I had 20 dials up here
p294
aVand I let you come up and fiddle with those numbers,
p295
aValmost any fiddling makes the universe disappear.
p296
aVSo can we explain those 20 numbers?
p297
aVAnd string theory suggests that those 20 numbers
p298
aVhave to do with the extra dimensions.
p299
aVLet me show you how.
p300
aVSo when we talk about the extra dimensions in string theory,
p301
aVit's not one extra dimension,
p302
aVas in the older ideas of Kaluza and Klein.
p303
aVThis is what string theory says about the extra dimensions.
p304
aVThey have a very rich, intertwined geometry.
p305
aa(lp306
VThis is an example of something known as a Calabi-Yau shape \u2014
p307
aVname isn't all that important.
p308
aVBut, as you can see,
p309
aVthe extra dimensions fold in on themselves
p310
aVand intertwine in a very interesting shape, interesting structure.
p311
aVAnd the idea is that if this is what the extra dimensions look like,
p312
aVthen the microscopic landscape of our universe all around us
p313
aVwould look like this on the tiniest of scales.
p314
aVWhen you swing your hand,
p315
aVyou'd be moving around these extra dimensions over and over again,
p316
aVbut they're so small that we wouldn't know it.
p317
aVSo what is the physical implication, though, relevant to those 20 numbers?
p318
aa(lp319
VConsider this. If you look at the instrument, a French horn,
p320
aVnotice that the vibrations of the airstreams
p321
aVare affected by the shape of the instrument.
p322
aVNow in string theory,
p323
aVall the numbers are reflections of the way strings can vibrate.
p324
aVSo just as those airstreams
p325
aVare affected by the twists and turns in the instrument,
p326
aVstrings themselves will be affected
p327
aVby the vibrational patterns in the geometry within which they are moving.
p328
aVSo let me bring some strings into the story.
p329
aVAnd if you watch these little fellows vibrating around \u2014
p330
aVthey'll be there in a second \u2014 right there,
p331
aVnotice that they way they vibrate is affected
p332
aVby the geometry of the extra dimensions.
p333
aa(lp334
VSo, if we knew exactly what the extra dimensions look like \u2014
p335
aVwe don't yet, but if we did \u2014
p336
aVwe should be able to calculate the allowed notes,
p337
aVthe allowed vibrational patterns.
p338
aVAnd if we could calculate the allowed vibrational patterns,
p339
aVwe should be able to calculate those 20 numbers.
p340
aVAnd if the answer that we get from our calculations
p341
aVagrees with the values of those numbers
p342
aVthat have been determined
p343
aVthrough detailed and precise experimentation,
p344
aVthis in many ways would be the first fundamental explanation
p345
aVfor why the structure of the universe is the way it is.
p346
aVNow, the second issue that I want to finish up with is:
p347
aVhow might we test for these extra dimensions more directly?
p348
aVIs this just an interesting mathematical structure
p349
aVthat might be able to explain
p350
aVsome previously unexplained features of the world,
p351
aVor can we actually test for these extra dimensions?
p352
aVAnd we think \u2014 and this is, I think, very exciting \u2014
p353
aVthat in the next five years or so we may be able to test
p354
aVfor the existence of these extra dimensions.
p355
aa(lp356
VHere's how it goes. In CERN, Geneva, Switzerland,
p357
aVa machine is being built called the Large Hadron Collider.
p358
aVIt's a machine that will send particles around a tunnel,
p359
aVopposite directions, near the speed of light.
p360
aVEvery so often those particles will be aimed at each other,
p361
aVso there's a head-on collision.
p362
aVThe hope is that if the collision has enough energy,
p363
aVit may eject some of the debris from the collision
p364
aVfrom our dimensions, forcing it to enter into the other dimensions.
p365
aVHow would we know it?
p366
aVWell, we'll measure the amount of energy after the collision,
p367
aVcompare it to the amount of energy before,
p368
aVand if there's less energy after the collision than before,
p369
aVthis will be evidence that the energy has drifted away.
p370
aVAnd if it drifts away in the right pattern that we can calculate,
p371
aVthis will be evidence that the extra dimensions are there.
p372
aa(lp373
VLet me show you that idea visually.
p374
aVSo, imagine we have a certain kind of particle called a graviton \u2014
p375
aVthat's the kind of debris we expect to be ejected out,
p376
aVif the extra dimensions are real.
p377
aVBut here's how the experiment will go.
p378
aVYou take these particles. You slam them together.
p379
aVYou slam them together, and if we are right,
p380
aVsome of the energy of that collision
p381
aVwill go into debris that flies off into these extra dimensions.
p382
aVSo this is the kind of experiment
p383
aVthat we'll be looking at in the next five, seven to 10 years or so.
p384
aVAnd if this experiment bears fruit,
p385
aVif we see that kind of particle ejected
p386
aVby noticing that there's less energy in our dimensions
p387
aVthan when we began,
p388
aVthis will show that the extra dimensions are real.
p389
aa(lp390
VAnd to me this is a really remarkable story,
p391
aVand a remarkable opportunity. Going back to Newton with absolute space \u2014
p392
aVdidn't provide anything but an arena, a stage
p393
aVin which the events of the universe take place.
p394
aVEinstein comes along and says,
p395
aVwell, space and time can warp and curve \u2014 that's what gravity is.
p396
aVAnd now string theory comes along and says,
p397
aVyes, gravity, quantum mechanics, electromagnetism,
p398
aVall together in one package,
p399
aVbut only if the universe has more dimensions than the ones that we see.
p400
aVAnd this is an experiment that may test for them in our lifetime.
p401
aVAmazing possibility.
p402
aVThank you very much.
