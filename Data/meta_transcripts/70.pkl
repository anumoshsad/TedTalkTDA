VThis is really a two-hour presentation I give to high school students,
p4
aVcut down to three minutes.
p5
aVAnd it all started one day on a plane, on my way to TED,
p6
aVseven years ago.
p7
aVAnd in the seat next to me was a high school student, a teenager,
p8
aVand she came from a really poor family.
p9
aVAnd she wanted to make something of her life,
p10
aVand she asked me a simple little question.
p11
aVShe said, "What leads to success?"
p12
aVAnd I felt really badly,
p13
aVbecause I couldn't give her a good answer.
p14
aa(lp15
VSo I get off the plane, and I come to TED.
p16
aVAnd I think, jeez, I'm in the middle of a room of successful people!
p17
aVSo why don't I ask them what helped them succeed,
p18
aVand pass it on to kids?
p19
aVSo here we are, seven years, 500 interviews later,
p20
aVand I'm going to tell you what really leads to success
p21
aVand makes TEDsters tick.
p22
aa(lp23
VAnd the first thing is passion.
p24
aVFreeman Thomas says, "I'm driven by my passion."
p25
aVTEDsters do it for love; they don't do it for money.
p26
aa(lp27
VCarol Coletta says, "I would pay someone to do what I do."
p28
aVAnd the interesting thing is:
p29
aVif you do it for love, the money comes anyway.
p30
aa(lp31
VWork! Rupert Murdoch said to me, "It's all hard work.
p32
aVNothing comes easily. But I have a lot of fun."
p33
aVDid he say fun? Rupert? Yes!
p34
aa(lp35
V(Laughter)
p36
aa(lp37
VTEDsters do have fun working. And they work hard.
p38
aVI figured, they're not workaholics. They're workafrolics.
p39
aa(lp40
V(Laughter)
p41
aa(lp42
VGood!
p43
aa(lp44
V(Applause)
p45
aa(lp46
VAlex Garden says, "To be successful, put your nose down in something
p47
aVand get damn good at it."
p48
aVThere's no magic; it's practice, practice, practice.
p49
aa(lp50
VAnd it's focus.
p51
aVNorman Jewison said to me,
p52
aV"I think it all has to do with focusing yourself on one thing."
p53
aa(lp54
VAnd push!
p55
aVDavid Gallo says, "Push yourself.
p56
aVPhysically, mentally, you've got to push, push, push."
p57
aVYou've got to push through shyness and self-doubt.
p58
aa(lp59
VGoldie Hawn says, "I always had self-doubts.
p60
aVI wasn't good enough; I wasn't smart enough.
p61
aVI didn't think I'd make it."
p62
aa(lp63
VNow it's not always easy to push yourself,
p64
aVand that's why they invented mothers.
p65
aa(lp66
V(Laughter)
p67
aa(lp68
V(Applause)
p69
aVFrank Gehry said to me,
p70
aV"My mother pushed me."
p71
aa(lp72
V(Laughter)
p73
aa(lp74
VServe!
p75
aVSherwin Nuland says, "It was a privilege to serve as a doctor."
p76
aa(lp77
VA lot of kids want to be millionaires.
p78
aVThe first thing I say is:
p79
aV"OK, well you can't serve yourself;
p80
aVyou've got to serve others something of value.
p81
aVBecause that's the way people really get rich."
p82
aa(lp83
VIdeas!
p84
aVTEDster Bill Gates says, "I had an idea:
p85
aVfounding the first micro-computer software company."
p86
aVI'd say it was a pretty good idea.
p87
aVAnd there's no magic to creativity in coming up with ideas \u2014
p88
aVit's just doing some very simple things.
p89
aVAnd I give lots of evidence.
p90
aa(lp91
VPersist!
p92
aVJoe Kraus says,
p93
aV"Persistence is the number one reason for our success."
p94
aVYou've got to persist through failure. You've got to persist through crap!
p95
aVWhich of course means "Criticism, Rejection, Assholes and Pressure."
p96
aa(lp97
V(Laughter)
p98
aa(lp99
VSo, the answer to this question is simple:
p100
aVPay 4,000 bucks and come to TED.
p101
aa(lp102
V(Laughter)
p103
aa(lp104
VOr failing that, do the eight things \u2014 and trust me,
p105
aVthese are the big eight things that lead to success.
p106
aa(lp107
VThank you TEDsters for all your interviews!
