VOK, first, some introductions.
p4
aVMy mom, Jennie, took this picture.
p5
aVThat's my dad, Frank, in the middle.
p6
aVAnd on his left, my sisters:
p7
aVMary Catherine, Judith Ann, Theresa Marie.
p8
aVJohn Patrick's sitting on his lap and Kevin Michael's on his right.
p9
aVAnd in the pale-blue windbreaker,
p10
aVSusan Diane. Me.
p11
aVI loved growing up in a big family.
p12
aVAnd one of my favorite things was picking names.
p13
aVBut by the time child number seven came along,
p14
aVwe had nearly run out of middle names.
p15
aVIt was a long deliberation
p16
aVbefore we finally settled on Jennifer Bridget.
p17
aVEvery parent in this audience
p18
aVknows the joy and excitement
p19
aVof picking a new baby's name.
p20
aVAnd I was excited and thrilled
p21
aVto help my mom in that special ceremonial moment.
p22
aa(lp23
VBut it's not like that everywhere.
p24
aVI travel a lot and I see a lot.
p25
aVBut it took me by surprise to learn
p26
aVin an area of Ethiopia,
p27
aVparents delay picking the names for their new babies
p28
aVby a month or more.
p29
aVWhy delay?
p30
aVWhy not take advantage of this special ceremonial time?
p31
aVWell, they delay because they're afraid.
p32
aVThey're afraid their baby will die.
p33
aVAnd this loss might be a little more bearable without a name.
p34
aVA face without a name might help them feel
p35
aVjust a little less attached.
p36
aa(lp37
VSo here we are in one part of the world \u2014
p38
aVa time of joy, excitement, dreaming of the future of that child \u2014
p39
aVwhile in another world,
p40
aVparents are filled with dread,
p41
aVnot daring to dream of a future for their child
p42
aVbeyond a few precious weeks.
p43
aVHow can that be?
p44
aVHow can it be that 2.6 million babies
p45
aVdie around the world
p46
aVbefore they're even one month old?
p47
aV2.6 million.
p48
aVThat's the population of Vancouver.
p49
aVAnd the shocking thing is:
p50
aVWhy?
p51
aVIn too many cases, we simply don't know.
p52
aa(lp53
VNow, I remember recently seeing an updated pie chart.
p54
aVAnd the pie chart was labeled,
p55
aV"Causes of death in children under five worldwide."
p56
aVAnd there was a pretty big section of that pie chart, about 40 percent \u2014
p57
aV40 percent was labeled "neonatal."
p58
aVNow, "neonatal" is not a cause of death.
p59
aVNeonatal is simply an adjective,
p60
aVan adjective that means that the child is less than one month old.
p61
aVFor me, "neonatal" said: "We have no idea."
p62
aa(lp63
VNow, I'm a scientist. I'm a doctor.
p64
aVI want to fix things.
p65
aVBut you can't fix what you can't define.
p66
aVSo our first step in restoring the dreams of those parents
p67
aVis to answer the question:
p68
aVWhy are babies dying?
p69
aa(lp70
VSo today, I want to talk about a new approach,
p71
aVan approach that I feel
p72
aVwill not only help us know why babies are dying,
p73
aVbut is beginning to completely transform
p74
aVthe whole field of global health.
p75
aVIt's called "Precision Public Health."
p76
aa(lp77
VFor me, precision medicine comes from a very special place.
p78
aVI trained as a cancer doctor, an oncologist.
p79
aVI got into it because I wanted to help people feel better.
p80
aVBut too often my treatments made them feel worse.
p81
aVI still remember young women being driven to my clinic
p82
aVby their moms \u2014
p83
aVadults, who had to be helped into my exam room by their mothers.
p84
aVThey were so weak
p85
aVfrom the treatment I had given them.
p86
aVBut at the time, in those front lines in the war on cancer,
p87
aVwe had few tools.
p88
aVAnd the tools we did have couldn't differentiate
p89
aVbetween the cancer cells that we wanted to hit hard
p90
aVand those healthy cells that we wanted to preserve.
p91
aVAnd so the side effects that you're all very familiar with \u2014
p92
aVhair loss, being sick to your stomach,
p93
aVhaving a suppressed immune system, so infection was a constant threat \u2014
p94
aVwere always surrounding us.
p95
aa(lp96
VAnd then I moved to the biotechnology industry.
p97
aVAnd I got to work on a new approach for breast cancer patients
p98
aVthat could do a better job of telling the healthy cells
p99
aVfrom the unhealthy or cancer cells.
p100
aVIt's a drug called Herceptin.
p101
aVAnd what Herceptin allowed us to do
p102
aVis to precisely target HER2-positive breast cancer,
p103
aVat the time, the scariest form of breast cancer.
p104
aVAnd that precision let us hit hard the cancer cells,
p105
aVwhile sparing and being more gentle on the normal cells.
p106
aVA huge breakthrough.
p107
aVIt felt like a miracle,
p108
aVso much so that today,
p109
aVwe're harnessing all those tools \u2014
p110
aVbig data, consumer monitoring, gene sequencing and more \u2014
p111
aVto tackle a broad variety of diseases.
p112
aVThat's allowing us to target individuals
p113
aVwith the right remedies at the right time.
p114
aa(lp115
VPrecision medicine revolutionized cancer therapy.
p116
aVEverything changed.
p117
aVAnd I want everything to change again.
p118
aVSo I've been asking myself:
p119
aVWhy should we limit
p120
aVthis smarter, more precise, better way to tackle diseases
p121
aVto the rich world?
p122
aVNow, don't misunderstand me \u2014
p123
aVI'm not talking about bringing expensive medicines like Herceptin
p124
aVto the developing world,
p125
aValthough I'd actually kind of like that.
p126
aVWhat I am talking about
p127
aVis moving from this precise targeting for individuals
p128
aVto tackle public health problems
p129
aVin populations.
p130
aa(lp131
VNow, OK, I know probably you're thinking, "She's crazy.
p132
aVYou can't do that. That's too ambitious."
p133
aVBut here's the thing:
p134
aVwe're already doing this in a limited way,
p135
aVand it's already starting to make a big difference.
p136
aa(lp137
VSo here's what's happening.
p138
aVNow, I told you I trained as a cancer doctor.
p139
aVBut like many, many doctors who trained in San Francisco in the '80s,
p140
aVI also trained as an AIDS doctor.
p141
aVIt was a terrible time.
p142
aVAIDS was a death sentence.
p143
aVAll my patients died.
p144
aVNow, things are better,
p145
aVbut HIV/AIDS remains a terrible global challenge.
p146
aVWorldwide, about 17 million women are living with HIV.
p147
aVWe know that when these women become pregnant,
p148
aVthey can transfer the virus to their baby.
p149
aVWe also know in the absence of therapy,
p150
aVhalf those babies will not survive until the age of two.
p151
aVBut we know that antiretroviral therapy can virtually guarantee
p152
aVthat she will not transmit the virus to the baby.
p153
aVSo what do we do?
p154
aa(lp155
VWell, a one-size-fits-all approach, kind of like that blast of chemo,
p156
aVwould mean we test and treat every pregnant woman in the world.
p157
aVThat would do the job.
p158
aVBut it's just not practical.
p159
aVSo instead, we target those areas where HIV rates are the highest.
p160
aVWe know in certain countries in sub-Saharan Africa
p161
aVwe can test and treat pregnant women where rates are highest.
p162
aVThis precision approach to a public health problem
p163
aVhas cut by nearly half
p164
aVHIV transmission from mothers to baby
p165
aVin the last five years.
p166
aa(lp167
V(Applause)
p168
aa(lp169
VScreening pregnant women in certain areas in the developing world
p170
aVis a powerful example
p171
aVof how precision public health can change things on a big scale.
p172
aa(lp173
VSo ...
p174
aVHow do we do that?
p175
aVWe can do that because we know.
p176
aVWe know who to target,
p177
aVwhat to target,
p178
aVwhere to target and how to target.
p179
aVAnd that, for me, are the important  elements of precision public health:
p180
aVwho, what, where and how.
p181
aa(lp182
VBut let's go back to the 2.6 million babies
p183
aVwho die before they're one month old.
p184
aVHere's the problem: we just don't know.
p185
aVIt may seem unbelievable,
p186
aVbut the way we figure out the causes of infant mortality
p187
aVin those countries with the highest infant mortality
p188
aVis a conversation with mom.
p189
aVA health worker asks a mom who has just lost her child,
p190
aV"Was the baby vomiting? Did they have a fever?"
p191
aVAnd that conversation may take place
p192
aVas long as three months after the baby has died.
p193
aVNow, put yourself in the shoes of that mom.
p194
aVIt's a heartbreaking, excruciating conversation.
p195
aVAnd even worse \u2014 it's not that helpful,
p196
aVbecause we might know there was a fever or vomiting,
p197
aVbut we don't know why.
p198
aVSo in the absence of knowing that knowledge,
p199
aVwe cannot prevent that mom, that family,
p200
aVor other families in that community
p201
aVfrom suffering the same tragedy.
p202
aa(lp203
VBut what if we applied a precision public health approach?
p204
aVLet's say, for example,
p205
aVwe find out in certain areas of Africa
p206
aVthat babies are dying because of a bacterial infection
p207
aVtransferred from the mother to the baby,
p208
aVknown as Group B streptococcus.
p209
aVIn the absence of treatment, mom has a seven times higher chance
p210
aVthat her next baby will die.
p211
aVOnce we define the problem, we can prevent that death
p212
aVwith something as cheap and safe as penicillin.
p213
aVWe can do that because then we'll know.
p214
aVAnd that's the point:
p215
aVonce we know, we can bring the right interventions
p216
aVto the right population in the right places
p217
aVto save lives.
p218
aa(lp219
VWith this approach, and with these interventions
p220
aVand others like them,
p221
aVI have no doubt
p222
aVthat a precision public health approach
p223
aVcan help our world achieve our 15-year goal.
p224
aVAnd that would translate into a million babies' lives saved
p225
aVevery single year.
p226
aVOne million babies every single year.
p227
aa(lp228
VAnd why would we stop there?
p229
aVA much more powerful approach to public health \u2014
p230
aVimagine what might be possible.
p231
aVWhy couldn't we more effectively tackle malnutrition?
p232
aVWhy wouldn't we prevent cervical cancer in women?
p233
aVAnd why not eradicate malaria?
p234
aa(lp235
V(Applause)
p236
aa(lp237
VYes, clap for that!
p238
aa(lp239
V(Applause)
p240
aa(lp241
VSo, you know, I live in two different worlds,
p242
aVone world populated by scientists,
p243
aVand another world populated by public health professionals.
p244
aVThe promise of precision public health
p245
aVis to bring these two worlds together.
p246
aVBut you know, we all live in two worlds:
p247
aVthe rich world and the poor world.
p248
aVAnd what I'm most excited about about precision public health
p249
aVis bridging these two worlds.
p250
aVEvery day in the rich world,
p251
aVwe're bringing incredible talent and tools \u2014
p252
aVeverything at our disposal \u2014
p253
aVto precisely target diseases in ways I never imagined
p254
aVwould be possible.
p255
aVSurely, we can tap into that kind of talent and tools
p256
aVto stop babies dying in the poor world.
p257
aVIf we did,
p258
aVthen every parent would have the confidence
p259
aVto name their child the moment that child is born,
p260
aVdaring to dream that that child's life will be measured in decades,
p261
aVnot days.
p262
