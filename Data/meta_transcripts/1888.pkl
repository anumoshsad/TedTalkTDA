VI would like to show you how
p4
aVarchitecture has helped
p5
aVto change the life of my community
p6
aVand has opened opportunities to hope.
p7
aa(lp8
VI am a native of Burkina Faso.
p9
aVAccording to the World Bank, Burkina Faso
p10
aVis one of the poorest countries in the world,
p11
aVbut what does it look like
p12
aVto grow up in a place like that?
p13
aVI am an example of that.
p14
aVI was born in a little village called Gando.
p15
aVIn Gando, there was no electricity,
p16
aVno access to clean drinking water, and no school.
p17
aVBut my father wanted me
p18
aVto learn how to read and write.
p19
aVFor this reason, I had to leave my family
p20
aVwhen I was seven and to stay in a city
p21
aVfar away from my village
p22
aVwith no contact with my family.
p23
aVIn this place I sat
p24
aVin a class like that
p25
aVwith more than 150 other kids,
p26
aVand for six years.
p27
aVIn this time, it just happened to me to come to school
p28
aVto realize that my classmate died.
p29
aa(lp30
VToday, not so much has changed.
p31
aVThere is still no electricity in my village.
p32
aVPeople still are dying in Burkina Faso,
p33
aVand access to clean drinking water
p34
aVis still a big problem.
p35
aa(lp36
VI had luck. I was lucky, because this is a fact of life
p37
aVwhen you grow up in a place like that.
p38
aVBut I was lucky.
p39
aVI had a scholarship.
p40
aVI could go to Germany to study.
p41
aa(lp42
VSo now, I suppose,
p43
aVI don't need to explain to you how great a privilege
p44
aVit is for me to be standing before you today.
p45
aVFrom Gando, my home village in Burkina Faso,
p46
aVto Berlin in Germany to become an architect
p47
aVis a big, big step.
p48
aVBut what to do with this privilege?
p49
aVSince I was a student, I wanted to open up
p50
aVbetter opportunities to other kids in Gando.
p51
aVI just wanted to use my skills and build a school.
p52
aVBut how do you do it when you're still a student
p53
aVand you don't have money?
p54
aVOh yes, I started to make drawings
p55
aVand asked for money.
p56
aVFundraising was not an easy task.
p57
aVI even asked my classmates
p58
aVto spend less money on coffee and cigarettes,
p59
aVbut to sponsor my school project.
p60
aVIn real wonder, two years later,
p61
aVI was able to collect 50,000 U.S. dollars.
p62
aa(lp63
VWhen I came home to Gando
p64
aVto bring the good news,
p65
aVmy people were over the moon,
p66
aVbut when they realized
p67
aVthat I was planning to use clay,
p68
aVthey were shocked.
p69
aa(lp70
V"A clay building is not able to stand a rainy season,
p71
aVand Francis wants us to use it and build a school.
p72
aVIs this the reason why he spent so much time
p73
aVin Europe studying
p74
aVinstead of working in the field with us?"
p75
aa(lp76
VMy people build all the time with clay,
p77
aVbut they don't see any innovation with mud.
p78
aVSo I had to convince everybody.
p79
aVI started to speak with the community,
p80
aVand I could convince everybody,
p81
aVand we could start to work.
p82
aVAnd the women, the men,
p83
aVeverybody from the village,
p84
aVwas part of this building process.
p85
aVI was allowed to use even traditional techniques.
p86
aVSo clay floor for example,
p87
aVthe young men come and stand like that, beating,
p88
aVhours for hours,
p89
aVand then their mothers came,
p90
aVand they are beating in this position,
p91
aVfor hours, giving water and beating.
p92
aVAnd then the polishers come.
p93
aVThey start polishing it with a stone for hours.
p94
aVAnd then you have this result,
p95
aVvery fine, like a baby bottom.
p96
aV(Laughter)
p97
aVIt's not photoshopped. (Laughter)
p98
aVThis is the school, built with the community.
p99
aVThe walls are totally made out
p100
aVof compressed clay blocks from Gando.
p101
aVThe roof structure is made
p102
aVwith cheap steel bars
p103
aVnormally hiding inside concrete.
p104
aVAnd the classroom, the ceiling is made
p105
aVout of both of them used together.
p106
aa(lp107
VIn this school, there was a simple idea:
p108
aVto create comfort in a classroom.
p109
aVDon't forget, it can be 45 degrees in Burkina Faso,
p110
aVso with simple ventilation,
p111
aVI wanted to make the classroom
p112
aVgood for teaching and learning.
p113
aVAnd this is the project today,
p114
aV12 years old, still in best condition.
p115
aVAnd the kids, they love it.
p116
aa(lp117
VAnd for me and my community,
p118
aVthis project was a huge success.
p119
aVIt has opened up opportunities
p120
aVto do more projects in Gando.
p121
aVSo I could do a lot of projects,
p122
aVand here I am going to share with you
p123
aVonly three of them.
p124
aa(lp125
VThe first one is the school extension, of course.
p126
aVHow do you explain drawings and engineering
p127
aVto people who are neither able to read nor write?
p128
aVI started to build a prototype like that.
p129
aVThe innovation was to build a clay vault.
p130
aVSo then, I jumped on the top like that,
p131
aVwith my team, and it works.
p132
aVThe community is looking. It still works.
p133
aVSo we can build. (Laughter)
p134
aVAnd we kept building, and that is the result.
p135
aVThe kids are happy, and they love it.
p136
aVThe community is very proud. We made it.
p137
aVAnd even animals, like these donkeys,
p138
aVlove our buildings.
p139
aV(Laughter)
p140
aa(lp141
VThe next project is the library in Gando.
p142
aVAnd see now, we tried to introduce
p143
aVdifferent ideas in our buildings,
p144
aVbut we often don't have so much material.
p145
aVSomething we have in Gando are clay pots.
p146
aVWe wanted to use them to create openings.
p147
aVSo we just bring them like you can see
p148
aVto the building site.
p149
aVwe start cutting them,
p150
aVand then we place them on top of the roof
p151
aVbefore we pour the concrete,
p152
aVand you have this result.
p153
aVThe openings are letting the hot air out
p154
aVand light in.
p155
aVVery simple.
p156
aa(lp157
VMy most recent project in Gando
p158
aVis a high school project.
p159
aVI would like to share with you this.
p160
aVThe innovation in this project
p161
aVis to cast mud like you cast concrete.
p162
aVHow do you cast mud?
p163
aVWe start making a lot of mortars, like you can see,
p164
aVand when everything is ready,
p165
aVwhen you know what is the best recipe
p166
aVand the best form,
p167
aVyou start working with the community.
p168
aVAnd sometimes I can leave.
p169
aVThey will do it themselves.
p170
aVI came to speak to you like that.
p171
aa(lp172
VAnother factor in Gando is rain.
p173
aVWhen the rains come,
p174
aVwe hurry up to protect our fragile walls
p175
aVagainst the rain.
p176
aVDon't confound with Christo and Jeanne-Claude.
p177
aVIt is simply how we protect our walls.
p178
aV(Laughter)
p179
aVThe rain in Burkina comes very fast,
p180
aVand after that, you have floods
p181
aVeverywhere in the country.
p182
aVBut for us, the rain is good.
p183
aVIt brings sand and gravel to the river
p184
aVwe need to use to build.
p185
aVWe just wait for the rain to go.
p186
aVWe take the sand, we mix it with clay,
p187
aVand we keep building.
p188
aVThat is it.
p189
aa(lp190
VThe Gando project was always connected to training the people,
p191
aVbecause I just wanted, one day
p192
aVwhen I fall down and die,
p193
aVthat at least one person from Gando
p194
aVkeeps doing this work.
p195
aVBut you will be surprised. I'm still alive.
p196
aV(Laughter)
p197
aa(lp198
VAnd my people now can use their skills
p199
aVto earn money themselves.
p200
aVUsually, for a young man from Gando to earn money,
p201
aVyou have to leave the country
p202
aVto the city, sometimes leave the country
p203
aVand some never come back,
p204
aVmaking the community weaker.
p205
aVBut now they can stay in the country
p206
aVand work on different building sites
p207
aVand earn money to feed their family.
p208
aVThere's a new quality in this work.
p209
aa(lp210
VYes, you know it.
p211
aVI have won a lot of awards through this work.
p212
aVFor sure, it has opened opportunities.
p213
aVI have become myself known.
p214
aVBut the reason why I do what I do
p215
aVis my community.
p216
aa(lp217
VWhen I was a kid,
p218
aVI was going to school,
p219
aVI was coming back every holiday to Gando.
p220
aVBy the end of every holidays,
p221
aVI had to say goodbye to the community,
p222
aVgoing from one compound to another one.
p223
aVAll women in Gando will open their clothes like that
p224
aVand give me the last penny.
p225
aVIn my culture, this is a symbol of deep affection.
p226
aVAs a seven-year-old guy, I was impressed.
p227
aVI just asked my mother one day,
p228
aV"Why do all these women love me so much?"
p229
aV(Laughter)
p230
aVShe just answered,
p231
aV"They are contributing to pay for your education
p232
aVhoping that you will be successful
p233
aVand one day come back and help
p234
aVimprove the quality of life of the community."
p235
aVI hope now that I was able to make my community proud
p236
aVthrough this work,
p237
aVand I hope I was able to prove you the power
p238
aVof community,
p239
aVand to show you that architecture
p240
aVcan be inspiring for communities
p241
aVto shape their own future.
p242
aa(lp243
VMerci beaucoup. (Applause)
p244
aVThank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
p245
aVThank you. Thank you. (Applause)
