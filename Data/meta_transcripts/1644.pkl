VHello. My name is Jarrett Krosoczka,
p4
aVand I write and illustrate books for children for a living.
p5
aVSo I use my imagination as my full-time job.
p6
aVBut well before my imagination was my vocation,
p7
aVmy imagination saved my life.
p8
aa(lp9
VWhen I was a kid, I loved to draw,
p10
aVand the most talented artist I knew
p11
aVwas my mother,
p12
aVbut my mother was addicted to heroin.
p13
aVAnd when your parent is a drug addict,
p14
aVit's kind of like Charlie Brown trying to kick the football,
p15
aVbecause as much as you want to love on that person,
p16
aVas much as you want to receive love from that person,
p17
aVevery time you open your heart, you end up on your back.
p18
aVSo throughout my childhood, my mother was incarcerated
p19
aVand I didn't have my father because
p20
aVI didn't even learn his first name until I was in the sixth grade.
p21
aVBut I had my grandparents,
p22
aVmy maternal grandparents Joseph and Shirley,
p23
aVwho adopted me just before my third birthday
p24
aVand took me in as their own,
p25
aVafter they had already raised five children.
p26
aVSo two people who grew up in the Great Depression,
p27
aVthere in the very, very early '80s took on a new kid.
p28
aVI was the Cousin Oliver of the sitcom
p29
aVof the Krosoczka family,
p30
aVthe new kid who came out of nowhere.
p31
aa(lp32
VAnd I would like to say that life was totally easy with them.
p33
aVThey each smoked two packs a day, each, nonfiltered,
p34
aVand by the time I was six,
p35
aVI could order a Southern Comfort Manhattan,
p36
aVdry with a twist, rocks on the side,
p37
aVthe ice on the side so you could fit more liquor in the drink.
p38
aa(lp39
VBut they loved the hell out of me. They loved me so much.
p40
aVAnd they supported my creative efforts,
p41
aVbecause my grandfather was a self-made man.
p42
aVHe ran and worked in a factory.
p43
aVMy grandmother was a homemaker.
p44
aVBut here was this kid who loved Transformers
p45
aVand Snoopy and the Ninja Turtles,
p46
aVand the characters that I read about, I fell in love with,
p47
aVand they became my friends.
p48
aVSo my best friends in life were the characters
p49
aVI read about in books.
p50
aa(lp51
VI went to Gates Lane Elementary School in Worcester, Massachusetts,
p52
aVand I had wonderful teachers there,
p53
aVmost notably in first grade Mrs. Alisch.
p54
aVAnd I just, I can just remember the love that she offered
p55
aVus as her students.
p56
aa(lp57
VWhen I was in the third grade,
p58
aVa monumental event happened.
p59
aVAn author visited our school, Jack Gantos.
p60
aVA published author of books came to talk to us
p61
aVabout what he did for a living.
p62
aVAnd afterwards, we all went back to our classrooms
p63
aVand we drew our own renditions of his main character,
p64
aVRotten Ralph.
p65
aVAnd suddenly the author appeared in our doorway,
p66
aVand I remember him sort of sauntering down the aisles,
p67
aVgoing from kid to kid looking at the desks, not saying a word.
p68
aVBut he stopped next to my desk,
p69
aVand he tapped on my desk, and he said,
p70
aV"Nice cat." (Laughter)
p71
aVAnd he wandered away.
p72
aVTwo words that made a colossal difference in my life.
p73
aa(lp74
VWhen I was in the third grade, I wrote a book for the first time,
p75
aV"The Owl Who Thought He Was The Best Flyer." (Laughter)
p76
aVWe had to write our own Greek myth,
p77
aVour own creation story, so I wrote a story about an owl
p78
aVwho challenged Hermes to a flying race,
p79
aVand the owl cheated,
p80
aVand Hermes, being a Greek god, grew angry and bitter,
p81
aVand turned the owl into a moon,
p82
aVso the owl had to live the rest of his life as a moon
p83
aVwhile he watched his family and friends play at night.
p84
aVYeah. (Laughter)
p85
aa(lp86
VMy book had a title page.
p87
aVI was clearly worried about my intellectual property when I was eight.
p88
aV(Laughter)
p89
aVAnd it was a story that was told with words and pictures,
p90
aVexactly what I do now for a living,
p91
aVand I sometimes let the words have the stage on their own,
p92
aVand sometimes I allowed the pictures to work on their own
p93
aVto tell the story.
p94
aa(lp95
VMy favorite page is the "About the author" page.
p96
aV(Laughter)
p97
aVSo I learned to write about myself in third person
p98
aVat a young age.
p99
aa(lp100
VSo I love that last sentence: "He liked making this book."
p101
aVAnd I liked making that book because I loved using my imagination,
p102
aVand that's what writing is.
p103
aVWriting is using your imagination on paper,
p104
aVand I do get so scared because I travel to so many schools now
p105
aVand that seems like such a foreign concept to kids,
p106
aVthat writing would be using your imagination on paper,
p107
aVif they're allowed to even write now within the school hours.
p108
aVSo I loved writing so much that I'd come home from school,
p109
aVand I would take out pieces of paper,
p110
aVand I would staple them together,
p111
aVand I would fill those blank pages with words and pictures
p112
aVjust because I loved using my imagination.
p113
aa(lp114
VAnd so these characters would become my friends.
p115
aVThere was an egg, a tomato, a head of lettuce and a pumpkin,
p116
aVand they all lived in this refrigerator city,
p117
aVand in one of their adventures they went to a haunted house
p118
aVthat was filled with so many dangers
p119
aVlike an evil blender who tried to chop them up,
p120
aVan evil toaster who tried to kidnap the bread couple,
p121
aVand an evil microwave who tried to melt their friend
p122
aVwho was a stick of butter. (Laughter)
p123
aVAnd I'd make my own comics too,
p124
aVand this was another way for me to tell stories,
p125
aVthrough words and through pictures.
p126
aa(lp127
VNow when I was in sixth grade,
p128
aVthe public funding all but eliminated the arts budgets
p129
aVin the Worcester public school system.
p130
aVI went from having art once a week
p131
aVto twice a month
p132
aVto once a month to not at all.
p133
aVAnd my grandfather, he was a wise man,
p134
aVand he saw that as a problem, because he knew
p135
aVthat was, like, the one thing I had. I didn't play sports.
p136
aVI had art.
p137
aVSo he walked into my room one evening,
p138
aVand he sat on the edge of my bed,
p139
aVand he said, "Jarrett, it's up to you, but if you'd like to,
p140
aVwe'd like to send you to the classes at the Worcester Art Museum."
p141
aVAnd I was so thrilled.
p142
aVSo from sixth through 12th grade,
p143
aVonce, twice, sometimes three times a week,
p144
aVI would take classes at the art museum,
p145
aVand I was surrounded by other kids who loved to draw,
p146
aVother kids who shared a similar passion.
p147
aa(lp148
VNow my publishing career began when I designed the cover
p149
aVfor my eighth grade yearbook,
p150
aVand if you're wondering about the style of dress I put our mascot in,
p151
aVI was really into Bell Biv DeVoe and MC Hammer
p152
aVand Vanilla Ice at the time. (Laughter)
p153
aVAnd to this day, I still can do karaoke to "Ice, Ice Baby"
p154
aVwithout looking at the screen.
p155
aVDon't tempt me, because I will do it.
p156
aa(lp157
VSo I get shipped off to private school,
p158
aVK through eight, public schools, but for some reason
p159
aVmy grandfather was upset that somebody
p160
aVat the local high school had been stabbed and killed,
p161
aVso he didn't want me to go there.
p162
aVHe wanted me to go to a private school, and he gave me an option.
p163
aVYou can go to Holy Name, which is coed,
p164
aVor St. John's, which is all boys.
p165
aVVery wise man, because he knew I would,
p166
aVI felt like I was making the decision on my own,
p167
aVand he knew I wouldn't choose St. John's,
p168
aVso I went to Holy Name High School,
p169
aVwhich was a tough transition because, like I said,
p170
aVI didn't play sports,
p171
aVand it was very focused on sports,
p172
aVbut I took solace in Mr. Shilale's art room.
p173
aVAnd I just flourished here.
p174
aVI just couldn't wait to get to that classroom every day.
p175
aa(lp176
VSo how did I make friends?
p177
aVI drew funny pictures of my teachers \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p178
aVand I passed them around.
p179
aVWell, in English class, in ninth grade,
p180
aVmy friend John, who was sitting next to me,
p181
aVlaughed a little bit too hard.
p182
aVMr. Greenwood was not pleased.
p183
aV(Laughter)
p184
aVHe instantly saw that I was the cause of the commotion,
p185
aVand for the first time in my life, I was sent to the hall,
p186
aVand I thought, "Oh no, I'm doomed.
p187
aVMy grandfather's just going to kill me."
p188
aVAnd he came out to the hallway and he said,
p189
aV"Let me see the paper."
p190
aVAnd I thought, "Oh no. He thinks it's a note."
p191
aVAnd so I took this picture, and I handed it to him.
p192
aVAnd we sat in silence for that brief moment,
p193
aVand he said to me,
p194
aV"You're really talented." (Laughter)
p195
aV"You're really good. You know, the school newspaper
p196
aVneeds a new cartoonist, and you should be the cartoonist.
p197
aVJust stop drawing in my class."
p198
aa(lp199
VSo my parents never found out about it.
p200
aVI didn't get in trouble. I was introduced to Mrs. Casey,
p201
aVwho ran the school newspaper,
p202
aVand I was for three and a half years
p203
aVthe cartoonist for my school paper,
p204
aVhandling such heavy issues as,
p205
aVseniors are mean,
p206
aVfreshmen are nerds,
p207
aVthe prom bill is so expensive. I can't believe how much it costs to go to the prom.
p208
aVAnd I took the headmaster to task
p209
aVand then I also wrote an ongoing story about a boy named Wesley
p210
aVwho was unlucky in love, and I just swore up and down
p211
aVthat this wasn't about me,
p212
aVbut all these years later it was totally me.
p213
aa(lp214
VBut it was so cool because I could write these stories,
p215
aVI could come up with these ideas,
p216
aVand they'd be published in the school paper,
p217
aVand people who I didn't know could read them.
p218
aVAnd I loved that thought, of being able to share my ideas
p219
aVthrough the printed page.
p220
aa(lp221
VOn my 14th birthday, my grandfather and my grandmother
p222
aVgave me the best birthday present ever:
p223
aVa drafting table that I have worked on ever since.
p224
aVHere I am, 20 years later,
p225
aVand I still work on this table every day.
p226
aVOn the evening of my 14th birthday,
p227
aVI was given this table, and we had Chinese food.
p228
aVAnd this was my fortune:
p229
aV"You will be successful in your work."
p230
aVI taped it to the top left hand of my table,
p231
aVand as you can see, it's still there.
p232
aVNow I never really asked my grandparents for anything.
p233
aVWell, two things: Rusty, who was a great hamster
p234
aVand lived a great long life when I was in fourth grade.
p235
aV(Laughter)
p236
aVAnd a video camera.
p237
aVI just wanted a video camera.
p238
aVAnd after begging and pleading for Christmas,
p239
aVI got a second-hand video camera,
p240
aVand I instantly started making my own animations
p241
aVon my own,
p242
aVand all throughout high school I made my own animations.
p243
aVI convinced my 10th grade English teacher to allow me
p244
aVto do my book report on Stephen King's "Misery"
p245
aVas an animated short. (Laughter)
p246
aa(lp247
VAnd I kept making comics.
p248
aVI kept making comics, and at the Worcester Art Museum,
p249
aVI was given the greatest piece of advice by any educator I was ever given.
p250
aVMark Lynch, he's an amazing teacher
p251
aVand he's still a dear friend of mine,
p252
aVand I was 14 or 15,
p253
aVand I walked into his comic book class halfway through the course,
p254
aVand I was so excited, I was beaming.
p255
aVI had this book that was how to draw comics in the Marvel way,
p256
aVand it taught me how to draw superheroes,
p257
aVhow to draw a woman, how to draw muscles
p258
aVjust the way they were supposed to be
p259
aVif I were to ever draw for X-Men or Spiderman.
p260
aVAnd all the color just drained from his face,
p261
aVand he looked at me, and he said,
p262
aV"Forget everything you learned."
p263
aVAnd I didn't understand. He said, "You have a great style.
p264
aVCelebrate your own style. Don't draw the way you're being told to draw.
p265
aVDraw the way you're drawing and keep at it,
p266
aVbecause you're really good."
p267
aa(lp268
VNow when I was a teenager, I was angsty as any teenager was,
p269
aVbut after 17 years of having a mother
p270
aVwho was in and out of my life like a yo-yo
p271
aVand a father who was faceless, I was angry.
p272
aVAnd when I was 17, I met my father for the first time,
p273
aVupon which I learned I had a brother and sister I had never known about.
p274
aVAnd on the day I met my father for the first time,
p275
aVI was rejected from the Rhode Island School of Design,
p276
aVmy one and only choice for college.
p277
aa(lp278
VBut it was around this time I went to Camp Sunshine
p279
aVto volunteer a week and working with the most amazing kids,
p280
aVkids with leukemia, and this kid Eric changed my life.
p281
aVEric didn't live to see his sixth birthday,
p282
aVand Eric lives with me every day.
p283
aa(lp284
VSo after this experience, my art teacher, Mr. Shilale,
p285
aVhe brought in these picture books,
p286
aVand I thought, "Picture books for kids!"
p287
aVand I started writing books for young readers
p288
aVwhen I was a senior in high school.
p289
aVWell, I eventually got to the Rhode Island School of Design.
p290
aVI transferred to RISD as a sophomore,
p291
aVand it was there that I took every course that I could on writing,
p292
aVand it was there that I wrote a story about a giant orange slug
p293
aVwho wanted to be friends with this kid.
p294
aVThe kid had no patience for him.
p295
aVAnd I sent this book out to a dozen publishers
p296
aVand it was rejected every single time,
p297
aVbut I was also involved with the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp,
p298
aVan amazing camp for kids with all sorts of critical illnesses,
p299
aVand it's those kids at the camp that read my stories,
p300
aVand I read to them, and I saw that they responded to my work.
p301
aa(lp302
VI graduated from RISD. My grandparents were very proud,
p303
aVand I moved to Boston, and I set up shop.
p304
aVI set up a studio and I tried to get published.
p305
aVI would send out my books. I would send out hundreds of postcards
p306
aVto editors and art directors,
p307
aVbut they would go unanswered.
p308
aVAnd my grandfather would call me every week,
p309
aVand he would say, "Jarrett, how's it going? Do you have a job yet?"
p310
aVBecause he had just invested a significant amount of money
p311
aVin my college education.
p312
aVAnd I said, "Yes, I have a job. I write and illustrate children's books."
p313
aVAnd he said, "Well, who pays you for that?"
p314
aVAnd I said, "No one, no one, no one just yet.
p315
aVBut I know it's going to happen."
p316
aa(lp317
VNow, I used to work the weekends at the Hole in the Wall off-season programming
p318
aVto make some extra money as I was trying to get my feet off the ground,
p319
aVand this kid who was just this really hyper kid,
p320
aVI started calling him "Monkey Boy,"
p321
aVand I went home and wrote a book called "Good Night, Monkey Boy."
p322
aVAnd I sent out one last batch of postcards.
p323
aVAnd I received an email from an editor at Random House
p324
aVwith a subject line, "Nice work!" Exclamation point.
p325
aa(lp326
V"Dear Jarrett, I received your postcard.
p327
aVI liked your art, so I went to your website
p328
aVand I'm wondering if you ever tried writing any of your own stories,
p329
aVbecause I really like your art and it looks like there are some stories that go with them.
p330
aVPlease let me know if you're ever in New York City."
p331
aVAnd this was from an editor at Random House Children's Books.
p332
aa(lp333
VSo the next week I "happened" to be in New York.
p334
aV(Laughter)
p335
aVAnd I met with this editor,
p336
aVand I left New York for a contract for my first book,
p337
aV"Good Night, Monkey Boy,"
p338
aVwhich was published on June 12, 2001.
p339
aa(lp340
VAnd my local paper celebrated the news.
p341
aVThe local bookstore made a big deal of it.
p342
aVThey sold out of all of their books.
p343
aVMy friend described it as a wake, but happy,
p344
aVbecause everyone I ever knew was there in line to see me,
p345
aVbut I wasn't dead. I was just signing books.
p346
aVMy grandparents, they were in the middle of it.
p347
aVThey were so happy. They couldn't have been more proud.
p348
aVMrs. Alisch was there. Mr. Shilale was there. Mrs. Casey was there.
p349
aVMrs. Alisch cut in front of the line and said,
p350
aV"I taught him how to read." (Laughter)
p351
aa(lp352
VAnd then something happened that changed my life.
p353
aVI got my first piece of significant fan mail,
p354
aVwhere this kid loved Monkey Boy so much
p355
aVthat he wanted to have a Monkey Boy birthday cake.
p356
aVFor a two-year-old, that is like a tattoo. (Laughter)
p357
aVYou know? You only get one birthday per year.
p358
aVAnd for him, it's only his second.
p359
aVAnd I got this picture, and I thought,
p360
aV"This picture is going to live within his consciousness
p361
aVfor his entire life. He will forever have this photo
p362
aVin his family photo albums."
p363
aa(lp364
VSo that photo, since that moment,
p365
aVis framed in front of me while I've worked on all of my books.
p366
aa(lp367
VI have 10 picture books out.
p368
aV"Punk Farm," "Baghead," "Ollie the Purple Elephant."
p369
aVI just finished the ninth book
p370
aVin the "Lunch Lady" series, which is a graphic novel series
p371
aVabout a lunch lady who fights crime.
p372
aVI'm expecting the release of a chapter book
p373
aVcalled "Platypus Police Squad: The Frog Who Croaked."
p374
aVAnd I travel the country visiting countless schools,
p375
aVletting lots of kids know that they draw great cats.
p376
aa(lp377
VAnd I meet Bagheads.
p378
aVLunch ladies treat me really well.
p379
aVAnd I got to see my name in lights
p380
aVbecause kids put my name in lights.
p381
aVTwice now, the "Lunch Lady" series has won
p382
aVthe Children's Choice Book of the Year in the third or fourth grade category,
p383
aVand those winners were displayed
p384
aVon a jumbotron screen in Times Square.
p385
aV"Punk Farm" and "Lunch Lady" are in development to be movies,
p386
aVso I am a movie producer
p387
aVand I really do think, thanks to that video camera
p388
aVI was given in ninth grade.
p389
aVI've seen people have "Punk Farm" birthday parties,
p390
aVpeople have dressed up as "Punk Farm" for Halloween,
p391
aVa "Punk Farm" baby room,
p392
aVwhich makes me a little nervous for the child's well-being in the long term.
p393
aa(lp394
VAnd I get the most amazing fan mail,
p395
aVand I get the most amazing projects,
p396
aVand the biggest moment for me came last Halloween.
p397
aVThe doorbell rang and it was a trick-or-treater
p398
aVdressed as my character. It was so cool.
p399
aa(lp400
VNow my grandparents are no longer living,
p401
aVso to honor them, I started a scholarship at the Worcester Art Museum
p402
aVfor kids who are in difficult situations
p403
aVbut whose caretakers can't afford the classes.
p404
aVAnd it displayed the work from my first 10 years of publishing,
p405
aVand you know who was there to celebrate? Mrs. Alisch.
p406
aa(lp407
VI said, "Mrs. Alisch, how are you?"
p408
aa(lp409
VAnd she responded with, "I'm here." (Laughter)
p410
aa(lp411
VThat's true. You are alive, and that's pretty good right now.
p412
aa(lp413
VSo the biggest moment for me, though,
p414
aVmy most important job now is I am a dad myself,
p415
aVand I have two beautiful daughters,
p416
aVand my goal is to surround them by inspiration,
p417
aVby the books that are in every single room of our house
p418
aVto the murals I painted in their rooms
p419
aVto the moments for creativity where you find, in quiet times,
p420
aVby making faces on the patio
p421
aVto letting her sit in the very desk
p422
aVthat I've sat in for the past 20 years.
p423
aVThank you. (Applause)
