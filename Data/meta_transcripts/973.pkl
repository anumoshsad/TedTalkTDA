VI've been fascinated for a lifetime
p4
aVby the beauty, form and function
p5
aVof giant bluefin tuna.
p6
aVBluefin are warmblooded like us.
p7
aVThey're the largest of the tunas,
p8
aVthe second-largest fish in the sea \u2014 bony fish.
p9
aVThey actually are a fish
p10
aVthat is endothermic \u2014
p11
aVpowers through the ocean with warm muscles like a mammal.
p12
aVThat's one of our bluefin at the Monterey Bay Aquarium.
p13
aVYou can see in its shape and its streamlined design
p14
aVit's powered for ocean swimming.
p15
aVIt flies through the ocean on its pectoral fins, gets lift,
p16
aVpowers its movements
p17
aVwith a lunate tail.
p18
aVIt's actually got a naked skin for most of its body,
p19
aVso it reduces friction with the water.
p20
aVThis is what one of nature's finest machines.
p21
aa(lp22
VNow, bluefin
p23
aVwere revered by Man
p24
aVfor all of human history.
p25
aVFor 4,000 years, we fished sustainably for this animal,
p26
aVand it's evidenced
p27
aVin the art that we see
p28
aVfrom thousands of years ago.
p29
aVBluefin are in cave paintings in France.
p30
aVThey're on coins
p31
aVthat date back 3,000 years.
p32
aVThis fish was revered by humankind.
p33
aVIt was fished sustainably
p34
aVtill all of time,
p35
aVexcept for our generation.
p36
aVBluefin are pursued wherever they go \u2014
p37
aVthere is a gold rush on Earth,
p38
aVand this is a gold rush for bluefin.
p39
aVThere are traps that fish sustainably
p40
aVup until recently.
p41
aVAnd yet, the type of fishing going on today,
p42
aVwith pens, with enormous stakes,
p43
aVis really wiping bluefin
p44
aVecologically off the planet.
p45
aVNow bluefin, in general,
p46
aVgoes to one place: Japan.
p47
aVSome of you may be guilty
p48
aVof having contributed to the demise of bluefin.
p49
aVThey're delectable muscle,
p50
aVrich in fat \u2014
p51
aVabsolutely taste delicious.
p52
aVAnd that's their problem; we're eating them to death.
p53
aVNow in the Atlantic, the story is pretty simple.
p54
aVBluefin have two populations: one large, one small.
p55
aVThe North American population
p56
aVis fished at about 2,000 ton.
p57
aVThe European population and North African \u2014 the Eastern bluefin tuna \u2014
p58
aVis fished at tremendous levels:
p59
aV50,000 tons over the last decade almost every year.
p60
aa(lp61
VThe result is whether you're looking
p62
aVat the West or the Eastern bluefin population,
p63
aVthere's been tremendous decline on both sides,
p64
aVas much as 90 percent
p65
aVif you go back with your baseline
p66
aVto 1950.
p67
aVFor that, bluefin have been given a status
p68
aVequivalent to tigers, to lions,
p69
aVto certain African elephants
p70
aVand to pandas.
p71
aVThese fish have been proposed
p72
aVfor an endangered species listing in the past two months.
p73
aVThey were voted on and rejected
p74
aVjust two weeks ago,
p75
aVdespite outstanding science
p76
aVthat shows from two committees
p77
aVthis fish meets the criteria of CITES I.
p78
aVAnd if it's tunas you don't care about,
p79
aVperhaps you might be interested
p80
aVthat international long lines and pursing
p81
aVchase down tunas and bycatch animals
p82
aVsuch as leatherbacks, sharks,
p83
aVmarlin, albatross.
p84
aVThese animals and their demise
p85
aVoccurs in the tuna fisheries.
p86
aVThe challenge we face
p87
aVis that we know very little about tuna,
p88
aVand everyone in the room knows what it looks like
p89
aVwhen an African lion
p90
aVtakes down its prey.
p91
aVI doubt anyone has seen a giant bluefin feed.
p92
aVThis tuna symbolizes
p93
aVwhat's the problem for all of us in the room.
p94
aa(lp95
VIt's the 21st century, but we really have only just begun
p96
aVto really study our oceans in a deep way.
p97
aVTechnology has come of age
p98
aVthat's allowing us to see the Earth from space
p99
aVand go deep into the seas remotely.
p100
aVAnd we've got to use these technologies immediately
p101
aVto get a better understanding
p102
aVof how our ocean realm works.
p103
aVMost of us from the ship \u2014 even I \u2014
p104
aVlook out at the ocean and see this homogeneous sea.
p105
aVWe don't know where the structure is.
p106
aVWe can't tell where are the watering holes
p107
aVlike we can on an African plain.
p108
aVWe can't see the corridors,
p109
aVand we can't see what it is
p110
aVthat brings together a tuna,
p111
aVa leatherback and an albatross.
p112
aVWe're only just beginning to understand
p113
aVhow the physical oceanography
p114
aVand the biological oceanography
p115
aVcome together
p116
aVto create a seasonal force
p117
aVthat actually causes the upwelling
p118
aVthat might make a hot spot a hope spot.
p119
aVThe reasons these challenges are great
p120
aVis that technically it's difficult to go to sea.
p121
aVIt's hard to study a bluefin on its turf,
p122
aVthe entire Pacific realm.
p123
aVIt's really tough to get up close and personal with a mako shark
p124
aVand try to put a tag on it.
p125
aVAnd then imagine being Bruce Mate's team from OSU,
p126
aVgetting up close to a blue whale
p127
aVand fixing a tag on the blue whale that stays,
p128
aVan engineering challenge
p129
aVwe've yet to really overcome.
p130
aa(lp131
VSo the story of our team, a dedicated team,
p132
aVis fish and chips.
p133
aVWe basically are taking
p134
aVthe same satellite phone parts,
p135
aVor the same parts that are in your computer, chips.
p136
aVWe're putting them together in unusual ways,
p137
aVand this is taking us into the ocean realm
p138
aVlike never before.
p139
aVAnd for the first time,
p140
aVwe're able to watch the journey of a tuna beneath the ocean
p141
aVusing light and photons
p142
aVto measure sunrise and sunset.
p143
aVNow, I've been working with tunas for over 15 years.
p144
aVI have the privilege of being a partner
p145
aVwith the Monterey Bay Aquarium.
p146
aVWe've actually taken a sliver of the ocean,
p147
aVput it behind glass,
p148
aVand we together
p149
aVhave put bluefin tuna and yellowfin tuna on display.
p150
aVWhen the veil of bubbles lifts every morning,
p151
aVwe can actually see a community from the Pelagic ocean,
p152
aVone of the only places on Earth
p153
aVyou can see giant bluefin swim by.
p154
aVWe can see in their beauty of form and function,
p155
aVtheir ceaseless activity.
p156
aVThey're flying through their space, ocean space.
p157
aVAnd we can bring two million people a year
p158
aVinto contact with this fish
p159
aVand show them its beauty.
p160
aa(lp161
VBehind the scenes is a working lab at Stanford University
p162
aVpartnered with the Monterey Bay Aquarium.
p163
aVHere, for over 14 or 15 years,
p164
aVwe've actually brought in
p165
aVboth bluefin and yellowfin in captivity.
p166
aVWe'd been studying these fish,
p167
aVbut first we had to learn how to husbandry them.
p168
aVWhat do they like to eat?
p169
aVWhat is it that they're happy with?
p170
aVWe go in the tanks with the tuna \u2014 we touch their naked skin \u2014
p171
aVit's pretty amazing. It feels wonderful.
p172
aVAnd then, better yet,
p173
aVwe've got our own version of tuna whisperers,
p174
aVour own Chuck Farwell, Alex Norton,
p175
aVwho can take a big tuna
p176
aVand in one motion,
p177
aVput it into an envelope of water,
p178
aVso that we can actually work with the tuna
p179
aVand learn the techniques it takes
p180
aVto not injure this fish
p181
aVwho never sees a boundary in the open sea.
p182
aVJeff and Jason there, are scientists
p183
aVwho are going to take a tuna
p184
aVand put it in the equivalent of a treadmill, a flume.
p185
aVAnd that tuna thinks it's going to Japan, but it's staying in place.
p186
aVWe're actually measuring its oxygen consumption,
p187
aVits energy consumption.
p188
aVWe're taking this data and building better models.
p189
aVAnd when I see that tuna \u2014 this is my favorite view \u2014
p190
aVI begin to wonder:
p191
aVhow did this fish solve the longitude problem before we did?
p192
aVSo take a look at that animal.
p193
aVThat's the closest you'll probably ever get.
p194
aVNow, the activities from the lab
p195
aVhave taught us now how to go out in the open ocean.
p196
aa(lp197
VSo in a program called Tag-A-Giant
p198
aVwe've actually gone from Ireland to Canada,
p199
aVfrom Corsica to Spain.
p200
aVWe've fished with many nations around the world
p201
aVin an effort to basically
p202
aVput electronic computers
p203
aVinside giant tunas.
p204
aVWe've actually tagged 1,100 tunas.
p205
aVAnd I'm going to show you three clips,
p206
aVbecause I tagged 1,100 tunas.
p207
aVIt's a very hard process, but it's a ballet.
p208
aVWe bring the tuna out, we measure it.
p209
aVA team of fishers, captains, scientists and technicians
p210
aVwork together to keep this animal out of the ocean
p211
aVfor about four to five minutes.
p212
aVWe put water over its gills, give it oxygen.
p213
aVAnd then with a lot of effort, after tagging,
p214
aVputting in the computer,
p215
aVmaking sure the stalk is sticking out so it senses the environment,
p216
aVwe send this fish back into the sea.
p217
aVAnd when it goes, we're always happy.
p218
aVWe see a flick of the tail.
p219
aVAnd from our data that gets collected,
p220
aVwhen that tag comes back,
p221
aVbecause a fisher returns it
p222
aVfor a thousand-dollar reward,
p223
aVwe can get tracks beneath the sea
p224
aVfor up to five years now,
p225
aVon a backboned animal.
p226
aa(lp227
VNow sometimes the tunas are really large,
p228
aVsuch as this fish off Nantucket.
p229
aVBut that's about half the size
p230
aVof the biggest tuna we've ever tagged.
p231
aVIt takes a human effort,
p232
aVa team effort, to bring the fish in.
p233
aVIn this case, what we're going to do
p234
aVis put a pop-up satellite archival tag on the tuna.
p235
aVThis tag rides on the tuna,
p236
aVsenses the environment around the tuna
p237
aVand actually will come off the fish,
p238
aVdetach, float to the surface
p239
aVand send back to Earth-orbiting satellites
p240
aVposition data estimated by math on the tag,
p241
aVpressure data and temperature data.
p242
aVAnd so what we get then from the pop-up satellite tag
p243
aVis we get away from having to have a human interaction
p244
aVto recapture the tag.
p245
aVBoth the electronic tags I'm talking about are expensive.
p246
aVThese tags have been engineered
p247
aVby a variety of teams in North America.
p248
aVThey are some of our finest instruments,
p249
aVour new technology in the ocean today.
p250
aVOne community in general
p251
aVhas given more to help us than any other community.
p252
aVAnd that's the fisheries off the state of North Carolina.
p253
aVThere are two villages, Harris and Morehead City,
p254
aVevery winter for over a decade,
p255
aVheld a party called Tag-A-Giant,
p256
aVand together, fishers worked with us
p257
aVto tag 800 to 900 fish.
p258
aVIn this case, we're actually going to measure the fish.
p259
aVWe're going to do something that in recent years we've started:
p260
aVtake a mucus sample.
p261
aVWatch how shiny the skin is; you can see my reflection there.
p262
aVAnd from that mucus, we can get gene profiles,
p263
aVwe can get information on gender,
p264
aVchecking the pop-up tag one more time,
p265
aVand then it's out in the ocean.
p266
aVAnd this is my favorite.
p267
aa(lp268
VWith the help of my former postdoc, Gareth Lawson,
p269
aVthis is a gorgeous picture of a single tuna.
p270
aVThis tuna is actually moving on a numerical ocean.
p271
aVThe warm is the Gulf Stream,
p272
aVthe cold up there in the Gulf of Maine.
p273
aVThat's where the tuna wants to go \u2014 it wants to forage on schools of herring \u2014
p274
aVbut it can't get there. It's too cold.
p275
aVBut then it warms up, and the tuna pops in, gets some fish,
p276
aVmaybe comes back to home base,
p277
aVgoes in again
p278
aVand then comes back to winter down there in North Carolina
p279
aVand then on to the Bahamas.
p280
aVAnd my favorite scene, three tunas going into the Gulf of Mexico.
p281
aVThree tunas tagged.
p282
aVAstronomically, we're calculating positions.
p283
aVThey're coming together. That could be tuna sex \u2014
p284
aVand there it is.
p285
aVThat is where the tuna spawn.
p286
aVSo from data like this,
p287
aVwe're able now to put the map up,
p288
aVand in this map
p289
aVyou see thousands of positions
p290
aVgenerated by this decade and a half of tagging.
p291
aVAnd now we're showing that tunas on the western side
p292
aVgo to the eastern side.
p293
aVSo two populations of tunas \u2014
p294
aVthat is, we have a Gulf population, one that we can tag \u2014
p295
aVthey go to the Gulf of Mexico, I showed you that \u2014
p296
aVand a second population.
p297
aVLiving amongst our tunas \u2014 our North American tunas \u2014
p298
aVare European tunas that go back to the Med.
p299
aVOn the hot spots \u2014 the hope spots \u2014
p300
aVthey're mixed populations.
p301
aa(lp302
VAnd so what we've done with the science
p303
aVis we're showing the International Commission,
p304
aVbuilding new models,
p305
aVshowing them that a two-stock no-mixing model \u2014
p306
aVto this day, used to reject
p307
aVthe CITES treaty \u2014
p308
aVthat model isn't the right model.
p309
aVThis model, a model of overlap,
p310
aVis the way to move forward.
p311
aVSo we can then predict
p312
aVwhere management places should be.
p313
aVPlaces like the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean
p314
aVare places where the single species,
p315
aVthe single population, can be captured.
p316
aVThese become forthright in places we need to protect.
p317
aVThe center of the Atlantic where the mixing is,
p318
aVI could imagine a policy that lets Canada and America fish,
p319
aVbecause they manage their fisheries well,
p320
aVthey're doing a good job.
p321
aVBut in the international realm,
p322
aVwhere fishing and overfishing has really gone wild,
p323
aVthese are the places that we have to make hope spots in.
p324
aVThat's the size they have to be to protect the bluefin tuna.
p325
aa(lp326
VNow in a second project
p327
aVcalled Tagging of Pacific Pelagics,
p328
aVwe took on the planet as a team,
p329
aVthose of us in the Census of Marine Life.
p330
aVAnd, funded primarily through Sloan Foundation and others,
p331
aVwe were able to actually go in, in our project \u2014
p332
aVwe're one of 17 field programs
p333
aVand begin to take on tagging large numbers of predators,
p334
aVnot just tunas.
p335
aVSo what we've done
p336
aVis actually gone up to tag salmon shark in Alaska,
p337
aVmet salmon shark on their home territory,
p338
aVfollowed them catching salmon
p339
aVand then went in and figured out
p340
aVthat, if we take a salmon and put it on a line,
p341
aVwe can actually take up a salmon shark \u2014
p342
aVThis is the cousin of the white shark \u2014
p343
aVand very carefully \u2014
p344
aVnote, I say "very carefully," \u2014
p345
aVwe can actually keep it calm,
p346
aVput a hose in its mouth, keep it off the deck
p347
aVand then tag it with a satellite tag.
p348
aVThat satellite tag will now have your shark phone home
p349
aVand send in a message.
p350
aVAnd that shark leaping there, if you look carefully, has an antenna.
p351
aVIt's a free swimming shark with a satellite tag
p352
aVjumping after salmon,
p353
aVsending home its data.
p354
aVSalmon sharks aren't the only sharks we tag.
p355
aVBut there goes salmon sharks with this meter-level resolution
p356
aVon an ocean of temperature \u2014 warm colors are warmer.
p357
aVSalmon sharks go down
p358
aVto the tropics to pup
p359
aVand come into Monterey.
p360
aa(lp361
VNow right next door in Monterey and up at the Farallones
p362
aVare a white shark team led by Scott Anderson \u2014 there \u2014
p363
aVand Sal Jorgensen.
p364
aVThey can throw out a target \u2014
p365
aVit's a carpet shaped like a seal \u2014
p366
aVand in will come a white shark, a curious critter
p367
aVthat will come right up to our 16-ft. boat.
p368
aVIt's a several thousand-pound animal.
p369
aVAnd we'll wind in the target.
p370
aVAnd we'll place an acoustic tag
p371
aVthat says, "OMSHARK 10165,"
p372
aVor something like that, acoustically with a ping.
p373
aVAnd then we'll put on a satellite tag
p374
aVthat will give us the long-distance journeys
p375
aVwith the light-based geolocation algorithms
p376
aVsolved on the computer that's on the fish.
p377
aVSo in this case, Sal's looking at two tags there,
p378
aVand there they are: the white sharks of California
p379
aVgoing off to the white shark cafe and coming back.
p380
aVWe also tag makos with our NOAA colleagues,
p381
aVblue sharks.
p382
aVAnd now, together, what we can see
p383
aVon this ocean of color that's temperature,
p384
aVwe can see ten-day worms of makos and salmon sharks.
p385
aVWe have white sharks and blue sharks.
p386
aVFor the first time,
p387
aVan ecoscape as large as ocean-scale,
p388
aVshowing where the sharks go.
p389
aa(lp390
VThe tuna team from TOPP has done the unthinkable:
p391
aVthree teams tagged 1,700 tunas,
p392
aVbluefin, yellowfin and albacore
p393
aVall at the same time \u2014
p394
aVcarefully rehearsed tagging programs
p395
aVin which we go out, pick up juvenile tunas,
p396
aVput in the tags that actually have the sensors,
p397
aVstick out the tuna
p398
aVand then let them go.
p399
aVThey get returned, and when they get returned,
p400
aVhere on a NASA numerical ocean
p401
aVyou can see bluefin in blue
p402
aVgo across their corridor,
p403
aVreturning to the Western Pacific.
p404
aa(lp405
VOur team from UCSC has tagged elephant seals
p406
aVwith tags that are glued on their heads, that come off when they slough.
p407
aVThese elephant seals cover half an ocean,
p408
aVtake data down to 1,800 feet \u2014
p409
aVamazing data.
p410
aVAnd then there's Scott Shaffer and our shearwaters
p411
aVwearing tuna tags, light-based tags,
p412
aVthat now are going to take you from New Zealand to Monterey and back,
p413
aVjourneys of 35,000 nautical miles
p414
aVwe had never seen before.
p415
aVBut now with light-based geolocation tags that are very small,
p416
aVwe can actually see these journeys.
p417
aVSame thing with Laysan albatross
p418
aVwho travel an entire ocean
p419
aVon a trip sometimes,
p420
aVup to the same zone the tunas use.
p421
aVYou can see why they might be caught.
p422
aVThen there's George Schillinger and our leatherback team out of Playa Grande
p423
aVtagging leatherbacks
p424
aVthat go right past where we are.
p425
aVAnd Scott Benson's team
p426
aVthat showed that leatherbacks go from Indonesia
p427
aVall the way to Monterey.
p428
aVSo what we can see on this moving ocean
p429
aVis we can finally see where the predators are.
p430
aVWe can actually see how they're using ecospaces
p431
aVas large as an ocean.
p432
aa(lp433
VAnd from this information,
p434
aVwe can begin to map the hope spots.
p435
aVSo this is just three years of data right here \u2014
p436
aVand there's a decade of this data.
p437
aVWe see the pulse and the seasonal activities
p438
aVthat these animals are going on.
p439
aVSo what we're able to do with this information
p440
aVis boil it down to hot spots,
p441
aV4,000 deployments,
p442
aVa huge herculean task,
p443
aV2,000 tags
p444
aVin an area, shown here for the first time,
p445
aVoff the California coast,
p446
aVthat appears to be a gathering place.
p447
aVAnd then for sort of an encore from these animals,
p448
aVthey're helping us.
p449
aVThey're carrying instruments
p450
aVthat are actually taking data down to 2,000 meters.
p451
aVThey're taking information from our planet
p452
aVat very critical places like Antarctica and the Poles.
p453
aVThose are seals from many countries
p454
aVbeing released
p455
aVwho are sampling underneath the ice sheets
p456
aVand giving us temperature data of oceanographic quality
p457
aVon both poles.
p458
aa(lp459
VThis data, when visualized, is captivating to watch.
p460
aVWe still haven't figured out best how to visualize the data.
p461
aVAnd then, as these animals swim
p462
aVand give us the information
p463
aVthat's important to climate issues,
p464
aVwe also think it's critical
p465
aVto get this information to the public,
p466
aVto engage the public with this kind of data.
p467
aVWe did this with the Great Turtle Race \u2014
p468
aVtagged turtles, brought in four million hits.
p469
aVAnd now with Google's Oceans,
p470
aVwe can actually put a white shark in that ocean.
p471
aVAnd when we do and it swims,
p472
aVwe see this magnificent bathymetry
p473
aVthat the shark knows is there on its path
p474
aVas it goes from California to Hawaii.
p475
aVBut maybe Mission Blue
p476
aVcan fill in that ocean that we can't see.
p477
aVWe've got the capacity, NASA has the ocean.
p478
aVWe just need to put it together.
p479
aa(lp480
VSo in conclusion,
p481
aVwe know where Yellowstone is for North America;
p482
aVit's off our coast.
p483
aVWe have the technology that's shown us where it is.
p484
aVWhat we need to think about perhaps for Mission Blue
p485
aVis increasing the biologging capacity.
p486
aVHow is it that we can actually
p487
aVtake this type of activity elsewhere?
p488
aVAnd then finally \u2014 to basically get the message home \u2014
p489
aVmaybe use live links
p490
aVfrom animals such as blue whales and white sharks.
p491
aVMake killer apps, if you will.
p492
aVA lot of people are excited
p493
aVwhen sharks actually went under the Golden Gate Bridge.
p494
aVLet's connect the public to this activity right on their iPhone.
p495
aVThat way we do away with a few internet myths.
p496
aa(lp497
VSo we can save the bluefin tuna.
p498
aVWe can save the white shark.
p499
aVWe have the science and technology.
p500
aVHope is here. Yes we can.
p501
aVWe need just to apply this capacity
p502
aVfurther in the oceans.
p503
aa(lp504
VThank you.
