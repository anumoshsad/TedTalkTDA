VLast year here at TED
p4
aVI asked you to give me your data,
p5
aVto put your data on the web, on the basis
p6
aVthat if people put data onto the web \u2014
p7
aVgovernment data, scientific data, community data,
p8
aVwhatever it is \u2014 it will be used by other people
p9
aVto do wonderful things, in ways
p10
aVthat they never could have imagined.
p11
aa(lp12
VSo, today I'm back just to show you a few things,
p13
aVto show you, in fact, there is
p14
aVan open data movement afoot,
p15
aVnow, around the world.
p16
aVThe cry of "Raw data now!"
p17
aVwhich I made people make in the auditorium,
p18
aVwas heard around the world.
p19
aVSo, let's roll the video.
p20
aa(lp21
VA classic story, the first one which lots of people picked up,
p22
aVwas when in March \u2014 on March 10th in fact, soon after TED \u2014
p23
aVPaul Clarke, in the U.K. government,
p24
aVblogged, "Oh, I've just got some raw data. Here it is,
p25
aVit's about bicycle accidents."
p26
aVTwo days it took the Times Online
p27
aVto make a map, a mashable map \u2014
p28
aVwe call these things mash-ups \u2014
p29
aVa mashed-up user interface that allows you to go in there
p30
aVand have a look and find out whether your bicycle
p31
aVroute to work was affected.
p32
aa(lp33
VHere's more data, traffic survey data,
p34
aVagain, put out by the U.K. government,
p35
aVand because they put it up using the Linked Data standards,
p36
aVthen a user could just make a map,
p37
aVjust by clicking.
p38
aa(lp39
VDoes this data affect things? Well, let's get back to 2008.
p40
aVLook at Zanesville, Ohio.
p41
aVHere's a map a lawyer made. He put on it the water plant,
p42
aVand which houses are there,
p43
aVwhich houses have been connected to the water.
p44
aVAnd he got, from other data sources,
p45
aVinformation to show
p46
aVwhich houses are occupied by white people.
p47
aVWell, there was too much of a correlation, he felt,
p48
aVbetween which houses were occupied by white people
p49
aVand which houses had water, and the judge was not impressed either.
p50
aVThe judge was not impressed to the tune of 10.9 million dollars.
p51
aVThat's the power of taking one piece of data,
p52
aVanother piece of data, putting it together,
p53
aVand showing the result.
p54
aa(lp55
VLet's look at some data from the U.K. now.
p56
aVThis is U.K. government data, a completely independent site,
p57
aVWhere Does My Money Go.
p58
aVIt allows anybody to go there and burrow down.
p59
aVYou can burrow down by a particular type of spending,
p60
aVor you can go through all the different regions and compare them.
p61
aVSo, that's happening in the U.K. with U.K. government data.
p62
aa(lp63
VYes, certainly you can do it over here.
p64
aVHere's a site which allows you to look at recovery spending
p65
aVin California.
p66
aVTake an arbitrary example, Long Beach, California,
p67
aVyou can go and have a look at what recovery money they've been spending
p68
aVon different things such as energy.
p69
aa(lp70
VIn fact, this is the graph of the number of data sets
p71
aVin the repositories of data.gov,
p72
aVand data.gov.uk.
p73
aVAnd I'm delighted to see a great competition
p74
aVbetween the U.K. in blue, and the U.S. in red.
p75
aa(lp76
VHow can you use this stuff?
p77
aVWell, for example, if you have lots of data about places
p78
aVyou can take, from a postcode \u2014
p79
aVwhich is like a zip plus four \u2014
p80
aVfor a specific group of houses, you can make paper,
p81
aVprint off a paper which has got very, very
p82
aVspecific things about the bus stops,
p83
aVthe things specifically near you.
p84
aa(lp85
VOn a larger scale, this is a mash-up
p86
aVof the data which was released about the Afghan elections.
p87
aVIt allows you to set your own criteria
p88
aVfor what sort of things you want to look at.
p89
aVThe red circles are polling stations,
p90
aVselected by your criteria.
p91
aVAnd then you can select also other things on the map
p92
aVto see what other factors, like the threat level.
p93
aVSo, that was government data.
p94
aa(lp95
VI also talked about community-generated data \u2014 in fact I edited some.
p96
aVThis is the wiki map, this is the Open Street Map.
p97
aV"Terrace Theater" I actually put
p98
aVon the map because it wasn't on the map before TED last year.
p99
aVI was not the only person editing the open street map.
p100
aVEach flash on this visualization \u2014
p101
aVput together by ITO World \u2014
p102
aVshows an edit in 2009
p103
aVmade to the Open Street Map.
p104
aVLet's now spin the world during the same year.
p105
aVEvery flash is an edit. Somebody somewhere
p106
aVlooking at the Open Street Map, and realizing it could be better.
p107
aVYou can see Europe is ablaze with updates.
p108
aVSome places, perhaps not as much as they should be.
p109
aa(lp110
VHere focusing in on Haiti.
p111
aVThe map of Port au-Prince at the end
p112
aVof 2009 was not all it could be,
p113
aVnot as good as the map of California.
p114
aVFortunately, just after the earthquake,
p115
aVGeoEye, a commercial company,
p116
aVreleased satellite imagery
p117
aVwith a license, which allowed
p118
aVthe open-source community to use it.
p119
aVThis is January, in time lapse,
p120
aVof people editing ... that's the earthquake.
p121
aVAfter the earthquake, immediately,
p122
aVpeople all over the world, mappers
p123
aVwho wanted to help, and could,
p124
aVlooked at that imagery, built the map, quickly building it up.
p125
aa(lp126
VWe're focusing now on Port-au-Prince.
p127
aVThe light blue is refugee camps these volunteers had spotted from the [satellite images].
p128
aVSo, now we have, immediately, a real-time map
p129
aVshowing where there are refugee camps \u2014
p130
aVrapidly became the best map
p131
aVto use if you're doing relief work in Port-au-Prince.
p132
aVWitness the fact that it's here on this Garmin device
p133
aVbeing used by rescue team in Haiti.
p134
aa(lp135
VThere's the map showing,
p136
aVon the left-hand side,
p137
aVthat hospital \u2014 actually that's a hospital ship.
p138
aVThis is a real-time map that shows blocked roads,
p139
aVdamaged buildings, refugee camps \u2014
p140
aVit shows things that are needed [for rescue and relief work].
p141
aa(lp142
VSo, if you've been involved in that at all,
p143
aVI just wanted to say: Whatever you've been doing,
p144
aVwhether you've just been chanting, "Raw data now!"
p145
aVor you've been putting government or scientific data online,
p146
aVI just wanted to take this opportunity to say: Thank you very much,
p147
aVand we have only just started!
