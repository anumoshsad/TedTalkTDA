VHello. I would like to start my talk
p4
aVwith actually two questions, and the first one is:
p5
aVHow many people here actually eat pig meat?
p6
aVPlease raise your hand \u2014
p7
aVoh, that's a lot.
p8
aVAnd how many people have actually seen
p9
aVa live pig producing this meat?
p10
aVIn the last year?
p11
aa(lp12
VIn the Netherlands \u2014 where I come from \u2014
p13
aVyou actually never see a pig, which is really strange,
p14
aVbecause, on a population of 16 million people,
p15
aVwe have 12 million pigs.
p16
aVAnd well, of course, the Dutch can't eat all these pigs.
p17
aVThey eat about one-third, and the rest is exported
p18
aVto all kinds of countries in Europe and the rest of the world.
p19
aVA lot goes to the U.K., Germany.
p20
aa(lp21
VAnd what I was curious about \u2014
p22
aVbecause historically, the whole pig would be used up until the last bit
p23
aVso nothing would be wasted \u2014
p24
aVand I was curious to find out
p25
aVif this was actually still the case.
p26
aVAnd I spent about three years researching.
p27
aVAnd I followed this one pig
p28
aVwith number "05049,"
p29
aVall the way up until the end
p30
aVand to what products it's made of.
p31
aVAnd in these years, I met all kinds people
p32
aVlike, for instance, farmers and butchers, which seems logical.
p33
aVBut I also met aluminum mold makers,
p34
aVammunition producers
p35
aVand all kinds of people.
p36
aVAnd what was striking to me
p37
aVis that the farmers actually had no clue
p38
aVwhat was made of their pigs,
p39
aVbut the consumers \u2014 as in us \u2014
p40
aVhad also no idea
p41
aVof the pigs being in all these products.
p42
aa(lp43
VSo what I did is,
p44
aVI took all this research
p45
aVand I made it into a \u2014 well, basically it's a product catalog of this one pig,
p46
aVand it carries a duplicate of his ear tag
p47
aVon the back.
p48
aVAnd it consists of seven chapters \u2014
p49
aVthe chapters are skin, bones, meat, internal organs,
p50
aVblood, fat and miscellaneous.
p51
aV(Laughter)
p52
aVIn total,
p53
aVthey weigh 103.7 kilograms.
p54
aVAnd to show you how often you actually
p55
aVmeet part of this pig in a regular day,
p56
aVI want to show you some images of the book.
p57
aa(lp58
VYou probably start the day with a shower.
p59
aVSo, in soap, fatty acids
p60
aVmade from boiling pork bone fat
p61
aVare used as a hardening agent,
p62
aVbut also for giving it a pearl-like effect.
p63
aVThen if you look around you in the bathroom,
p64
aVyou see lots more products
p65
aVlike shampoo, conditioner,
p66
aVanti-wrinkle cream, body lotion,
p67
aVbut also toothpaste.
p68
aVThen, so, before breakfast,
p69
aVyou've already met the pig so many times.
p70
aVThen, at breakfast, the pig that I followed,
p71
aVthe hairs off the pig or proteins from the hairs off the pig
p72
aVwere used as an improver of dough.
p73
aV(Laughter)
p74
aVWell, that's what the producer says: it's "improving the dough,
p75
aVof course."
p76
aVIn low-fat butter, or actually in many low-fat products,
p77
aVwhen you take the fat out, you actually take the taste and the texture out.
p78
aVSo what they do is they put gelatin back in,
p79
aVin order to retain the texture.
p80
aa(lp81
VWell, when you're off to work, under the road or under the buildings that you see,
p82
aVthere might very well be cellular concrete,
p83
aVwhich is a very light kind of concrete
p84
aVthat's actually got proteins from bones inside
p85
aVand it's also fully reusable.
p86
aVIn the train brakes \u2014 at least in the German train brakes \u2014
p87
aVthere's this part of the brake
p88
aVthat's made of bone ash.
p89
aVAnd in cheesecake and all kinds of desserts,
p90
aVlike chocolate mousse, tiramisu, vanilla pudding,
p91
aVeverything that's cooled in the supermarket,
p92
aVthere's gelatin to make it look good.
p93
aVFine bone china \u2014 this is a real classic.
p94
aVOf course, the bone in fine-bone china
p95
aVgives it its translucency
p96
aVand also its strength,
p97
aVin order to make these really fine shapes,
p98
aVlike this deer.
p99
aa(lp100
VIn interior decorating, the pig's actually quite there.
p101
aVIt's used in paint for the texture,
p102
aVbut also for the glossiness.
p103
aVIn sandpaper, bone glue
p104
aVis actually the glue between the sand and the paper.
p105
aVAnd then in paintbrushes,
p106
aVhairs are used because, apparently, they're very suitable for making paintbrushes
p107
aVbecause of their hard-wearing nature.
p108
aa(lp109
VI was not planning on showing you any meat
p110
aVbecause, of course, half the book's meat
p111
aVand you probably all know what meats they are.
p112
aVBut I didn't want you to miss out on this one,
p113
aVbecause this, well, it's called "portion-controlled meat cuts."
p114
aVAnd this is actually sold
p115
aVin the frozen area of the supermarket.
p116
aVAnd what it is \u2014 it's actually steak.
p117
aVSo, this is sold as cow,
p118
aVbut what happens when you slaughter a cow \u2014
p119
aVat least in industrial factory farming \u2014
p120
aVthey have all these little bits of steak left
p121
aVthat they can't actually sell as steak,
p122
aVso what they do is they glue them all together
p123
aVwith fibrin from pig blood
p124
aVinto this really large sausage,
p125
aVthen freeze the sausage, cut it in little slices
p126
aVand sell those as steak again.
p127
aVAnd this also actually happens with tuna and scallops.
p128
aVSo, with the steak, you might drink a beer.
p129
aVIn the brewing process, there's lots of cloudy elements in the beer,
p130
aVso to get rid of these cloudy elements,
p131
aVwhat some companies do
p132
aVis they pour the beer through a sort of gelatin sieve
p133
aVin order to get rid of that cloudiness.
p134
aVThis actually also goes for wine as well as fruit juice.
p135
aa(lp136
VThere's actually a company in Greece
p137
aVthat produces these cigarettes
p138
aVthat actually contain hemoglobin from pigs in the filter.
p139
aVAnd according to them,
p140
aVthis creates an artificial lung in the filter.
p141
aV(Laughter)
p142
aVSo, this is actually a healthier cigarette.
p143
aV(Laughter)
p144
aVInjectable collagen \u2014 or, since the '70s, collagen from pigs \u2014
p145
aVhas been used for injecting into wrinkles.
p146
aVAnd the reason for this is that pigs are actually quite close to human beings,
p147
aVso the collagen is as well.
p148
aVWell, this must be the strangest thing I found.
p149
aVThis is a bullet coming from
p150
aVa very large ammunition company in the United States.
p151
aa(lp152
VAnd while I was making the book,
p153
aVI contacted all the producers of products
p154
aVbecause I wanted them to send me the real samples
p155
aVand the real specimens.
p156
aVSo I sent this company an email
p157
aVsaying, "Hello. I'm Christien. I'm doing this research.
p158
aVAnd can you send me a bullet?"
p159
aV(Laughter)
p160
aVAnd well, I didn't expect them to even answer my email.
p161
aVBut they answered
p162
aVand they said, "Why, thank you for your email. What an interesting story.
p163
aVAre you in anyway related to the Dutch government?"
p164
aVI thought that was really weird,
p165
aVas if the Dutch government sends emails to anyone.
p166
aa(lp167
V(Laughter)
p168
aa(lp169
VSo, the most beautiful thing I found \u2014
p170
aVat least what I think is the most beautiful \u2014 in the book, is this heart valve.
p171
aVIt's actually a very low-tech
p172
aVand very high-tech product at the same time.
p173
aVThe low-tech bit is that it's literally a pig's heart valve
p174
aVmounted in the high-tech bit,
p175
aVwhich is a memory metal casing.
p176
aVAnd what happens is this can be implanted into a human heart
p177
aVwithout open heart surgery.
p178
aVAnd once it's in the right spot,
p179
aVthey remove the outer shell,
p180
aVand the heart valve, well, it gets this shape
p181
aVand at that moment it starts beating, instantly.
p182
aVIt's really a sort of magical moment.
p183
aVSo this is actually a Dutch company,
p184
aVso I called them up, and I asked,
p185
aV"Can I borrow a heart valve from you?"
p186
aVAnd the makers of this thing were really enthusiastic.
p187
aVSo they were like, "Okay, we'll put it in a jar for you with formalin,
p188
aVand you can borrow it."
p189
aVGreat \u2014 and then I didn't hear from them for weeks,
p190
aVso I called,
p191
aVand I asked, "What's going on with the heart valve?"
p192
aVAnd they said, "Well the director of the company
p193
aVdecided not to let you borrow this heart valve,
p194
aVbecause want his product
p195
aVto be associated with pigs."
p196
aa(lp197
V(Laughter)
p198
aa(lp199
VWell, the last product from the book that I'm showing you is renewable energy \u2014
p200
aVactually, to show that my first question,
p201
aVif pigs are still used up until the last bit, was still true.
p202
aVWell it is, because everything that can't be used for anything else
p203
aVis made into a fuel
p204
aVthat can be used as renewable energy source.
p205
aa(lp206
VIn total, I found 185 products.
p207
aVAnd what they showed me
p208
aVis that, well, firstly,
p209
aVit's at least to say odd
p210
aVthat we don't treat these pigs
p211
aVas absolute kings and queens.
p212
aVAnd the second, is that we actually don't have a clue
p213
aVof what all these products that surround us are made of.
p214
aa(lp215
VAnd you might think I'm very fond of pigs,
p216
aVbut actually \u2014 well, I am a little bit \u2014
p217
aVbut I'm more fond
p218
aVof raw materials in general.
p219
aVAnd I think that, in order to take better care
p220
aVof what's behind our products \u2014
p221
aVso, the livestock, the crops, the plants,
p222
aVthe non-renewable materials,
p223
aVbut also the people that produce these products \u2014
p224
aVthe first step would actually be to know that they are there.
p225
aa(lp226
VThank you very much.
