VI was here about four years ago,
p4
aVtalking about the relationship of design and happiness.
p5
aVAt the very end of it, I showed a list under that title.
p6
aVI learned very few things in addition since
p7
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p8
aVbut made a whole number of them into projects since.
p9
aVThese are inflatable monkeys in every city in Scotland:
p10
aV"Everybody always thinks they are right."
p11
aVThey were combined in the media.
p12
aV"Drugs are fun in the beginning but become a drag later on."
p13
aVWe're doing changing media.
p14
aVThis is a projection that can see the viewer
p15
aVas the viewer walks by.
p16
aVYou can't help but actually ripping that spider web apart.
p17
aVAll of these things are pieces of graphic design.
p18
aVWe do them for our clients.
p19
aVThey are commissioned.
p20
aVI would never have the money to actually pay for the installment
p21
aVor pay for all the billboards or the production of these,
p22
aVso there's always a client attached to them.
p23
aVThese are 65,000 coat hangers in a street
p24
aVthat's lined with fashion stores.
p25
aV"Worrying solves nothing."
p26
aV"Money does not make me happy"
p27
aVappeared first as double-page spreads in a magazine.
p28
aVThe printer lost the file, didn't tell us.
p29
aVWhen the magazine \u2014 actually, when I got the subscription \u2014
p30
aVit was 12 following pages.
p31
aVIt said, "Money does does make me happy."
p32
aVAnd a friend of mine in Austria felt so sorry for me
p33
aVthat he talked the largest casino owner in Linz
p34
aVinto letting us wrap his building.
p35
aVSo this is the big pedestrian zone in Linz.
p36
aVIt just says "Money," and if you look down the side street,
p37
aVit says, "does not make me happy."
p38
aVWe had a show that just came down last week in New York.
p39
aVWe steamed up the windows permanently,
p40
aVand every hour we had a different designer come in
p41
aVand write these things that they've learned into the steam in the window.
p42
aVEverybody participated \u2014 Milton Glaser,
p43
aVMassimo Vignelli.
p44
aVSingapore was quite in discussion.
p45
aVThis is a little spot that we filmed there
p46
aVthat's to be displayed on the large JumboTrons in Singapore.
p47
aVAnd, of course, it's one that's dear to my heart,
p48
aVbecause all of these sentiments \u2014
p49
aVsome banal, some a bit more profound \u2014
p50
aVall originally had come out of my diary.
p51
aVAnd I do go often into the diary
p52
aVand check if I wanted to change something about the situation.
p53
aVIf it's \u2014 see it for a long enough time,
p54
aVI actually do something about it.
p55
aVAnd the very last one is a billboard.
p56
aVThis is our roof in New York, the roof of the studio.
p57
aVThis is newsprint plus stencils that lie on the newsprint.
p58
aVWe let that lie around in the sun.
p59
aVAs you all know, newsprint yellows significantly in the sun.
p60
aVAfter a week, we took the stencils and the leaves off,
p61
aVshipped the newsprints to Lisbon to a very sunny spot,
p62
aVso on day one the billboard said,
p63
aV"Complaining is silly. Either act or forget."
p64
aVThree days later it faded, and a week later,
p65
aVno more complaining anywhere.
p66
aV(Laughter)
p67
aVThank you so much.
p68
aV(Applause)
