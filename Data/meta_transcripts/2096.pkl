VI've been a critical care EMT for the past seven years in Suffolk County, New York.
p4
aVI've been a first responder in a number of incidents
p5
aVranging from car accidents to Hurricane Sandy.
p6
aa(lp7
VIf you are like most people, death might be
p8
aVone of your greatest fears.
p9
aVSome of us will see it coming.
p10
aVSome of us won't.
p11
aVThere is a little-known documented medical term
p12
aVcalled impending doom.
p13
aVIt's almost a symptom.
p14
aVAs a medical provider, I'm trained to respond
p15
aVto this symptom like any other,
p16
aVso when a patient having a heart attack looks at me
p17
aVand says, "I'm going to die today,"
p18
aVwe are trained to reevaluate the patient's condition.
p19
aa(lp20
VThroughout my career, I have responded
p21
aVto a number of incidents where the patient
p22
aVhad minutes left to live
p23
aVand there was nothing I could do for them.
p24
aVWith this, I was faced with a dilemma:
p25
aVDo I tell the dying that they are about to face death,
p26
aVor do I lie to them to comfort them?
p27
aVEarly in my career, I faced this dilemma
p28
aVby simply lying.
p29
aVI was afraid.
p30
aVI was afraid if I told them the truth,
p31
aVthat they would die in terror, in fear,
p32
aVjust grasping for those last moments of life.
p33
aa(lp34
VThat all changed with one incident.
p35
aVFive years ago, I responded to a motorcycle accident.
p36
aVThe rider had suffered critical, critical injuries.
p37
aVAs I assessed him, I realized that there was nothing
p38
aVthat could be done for him,
p39
aVand like so many other cases, he looked me in the eye
p40
aVand asked that question: "Am I going to die?"
p41
aVIn that moment, I decided to do something different.
p42
aVI decided to tell him the truth.
p43
aVI decided to tell him that he was going to die
p44
aVand that there was nothing I could do for him.
p45
aVHis reaction shocked me to this day.
p46
aVHe simply laid back and had a look
p47
aVof acceptance on his face.
p48
aVHe was not met with that terror or fear
p49
aVthat I thought he would be.
p50
aVHe simply laid there, and as I looked into his eyes,
p51
aVI saw inner peace and acceptance.
p52
aVFrom that moment forward, I decided
p53
aVit was not my place to comfort the dying with my lies.
p54
aVHaving responded to many cases since then
p55
aVwhere patients were in their last moments
p56
aVand there was nothing I could do for them,
p57
aVin almost every case,
p58
aVthey have all had the same reaction to the truth,
p59
aVof inner peace and acceptance.
p60
aVIn fact, there are three patterns
p61
aVI have observed in all these cases.
p62
aa(lp63
VThe first pattern always kind of shocked me.
p64
aVRegardless of religious belief or cultural background,
p65
aVthere's a need for forgiveness.
p66
aVWhether they call it sin
p67
aVor they simply say they have a regret,
p68
aVtheir guilt is universal.
p69
aVI had once cared for an elderly gentleman
p70
aVwho was having a massive heart attack.
p71
aVAs I prepared myself and my equipment
p72
aVfor his imminent cardiac arrest,
p73
aVI began to tell the patient of his imminent demise.
p74
aVHe already knew by my tone of voice and body language.
p75
aVAs I placed the defibrillator pads on his chest,
p76
aVprepping for what was going to happen,
p77
aVhe looked me in the eye and said,
p78
aV"I wish I had spent more time with my children and grandchildren
p79
aVinstead of being selfish with my time."
p80
aVFaced with imminent death,
p81
aVall he wanted was forgiveness.
p82
aa(lp83
VThe second pattern I observe
p84
aVis the need for remembrance.
p85
aVWhether it was to be remembered in my thoughts
p86
aVor their loved ones', they needed to feel
p87
aVthat they would be living on.
p88
aVThere's a need for immortality
p89
aVwithin the hearts and thoughts of their loved ones,
p90
aVmyself, my crew, or anyone around.
p91
aVCountless times, I have had a  patient look me in the eyes
p92
aVand say, "Will you remember me?"
p93
aa(lp94
VThe final pattern I observe
p95
aValways touched me the deepest, to the soul.
p96
aVThe dying need to know that their life had meaning.
p97
aVThey need to know that they did not waste their life
p98
aVon meaningless tasks.
p99
aa(lp100
VThis came to me very, very early in my career.
p101
aVI had responded to a call.
p102
aVThere was a female in her late 50s
p103
aVseverely pinned within a vehicle.
p104
aVShe had been t-boned at a high rate of speed,
p105
aVcritical, critical condition.
p106
aVAs the fire department worked to remove her from the car,
p107
aVI climbed in to begin to render care.
p108
aVAs we talked, she had said to me,
p109
aV"There was so much more I wanted to do with my life."
p110
aVShe had felt she had not left her mark on this Earth.
p111
aVAs we talked further, it would turn out
p112
aVthat she was a mother of two adopted children
p113
aVwho were both on their way to medical school.
p114
aVBecause of her, two children
p115
aVhad a chance they never would have had otherwise
p116
aVand would go on to save lives in the medical field
p117
aVas medical doctors.
p118
aVIt would end up taking 45 minutes
p119
aVto free her from the vehicle.
p120
aVHowever, she perished prior to freeing her.
p121
aa(lp122
VI believed what you saw in the movies:
p123
aVwhen you're in those last moments
p124
aVthat it's strictly terror, fear.
p125
aVI have come to realize, regardless of the circumstance,
p126
aVit's generally met with peace and acceptance,
p127
aVthat it's the littlest things, the littlest moments,
p128
aVthe littlest things you brought into the world
p129
aVthat give you peace in those final moments.
p130
aa(lp131
VThank you.
