VToday I'm going to unpack for you
p4
aVthree examples of iconic design,
p5
aVand it makes perfect sense
p6
aVthat I should be the one to do it
p7
aVbecause I have a Bachelor's degree in Literature.
p8
aV(Laughter)
p9
aVBut I'm also a famous
p10
aVminor television personality
p11
aVand an avid collector of
p12
aVDesign Within Reach catalogs,
p13
aVso I pretty much know
p14
aVeverything there is.
p15
aa(lp16
VNow, I'm sure you
p17
aVrecognize this object;
p18
aVmany of you probably saw it
p19
aVas you were landing your private zeppelins
p20
aVat Los Angeles International Airport
p21
aVover the past couple of days.
p22
aVThis is known as the Theme Building;
p23
aVthat is its name for reasons
p24
aVthat are still very murky.
p25
aVAnd it is perhaps
p26
aVthe best example we have in Los Angeles
p27
aVof ancient extraterrestrial architecture.
p28
aa(lp29
VIt was first excavated in 1961
p30
aVas they were building LAX,
p31
aValthough scientists believe that
p32
aVit dates back to the year 2000
p33
aVBefore Common Era,
p34
aVwhen it was used as
p35
aVa busy transdimensional space port
p36
aVby the ancient astronauts
p37
aVwho first colonized this planet
p38
aVand raised our species
p39
aVfrom savagery by giving us
p40
aVthe gift of written language
p41
aVand technology and
p42
aVthe gift of revolving restaurants.
p43
aa(lp44
VIt is thought to have been
p45
aVa replacement for the older space ports
p46
aVlocated, of course, at Stonehenge
p47
aVand considered to be
p48
aVquite an improvement
p49
aVdue to the uncluttered design,
p50
aVthe lack of druids hanging around all the time
p51
aVand obviously, the much better
p52
aVaccess to parking.
p53
aVWhen it was uncovered,
p54
aVit ushered in a new era
p55
aVof streamlined, archaically futuristic design
p56
aVcalled Googie,
p57
aVwhich came to be synonymous with
p58
aVthe Jet Age, a misnomer.
p59
aVAfter all, the ancient astronauts who used it
p60
aVdid not travel by jet very often,
p61
aVpreferring instead to travel by feathered serpent
p62
aVpowered by crystal skulls.
p63
aa(lp64
V(Applause)
p65
aa(lp66
V(Music)
p67
aa(lp68
VAh yes, a table.
p69
aVWe use these every day.
p70
aVAnd on top of it,
p71
aVthe juicy salif.
p72
aVThis is a design by Philippe Starck,
p73
aVwho I believe is in the audience at this very moment.
p74
aVAnd you can tell it is a Starck design
p75
aVby its precision, its playfulness,
p76
aVits innovation and
p77
aVits promise of imminent violence.
p78
aV(Laughter)
p79
aa(lp80
VIt is a design that challenges your intuition \u2014
p81
aVit is not what you think it is when you first see it.
p82
aVIt is not a fork designed
p83
aVto grab three hors d'oeuvres at a time,
p84
aVwhich would be useful out in the lobby,
p85
aVI would say.
p86
aVAnd despite its obvious
p87
aVinfluence by the ancient astronauts
p88
aVand its space agey-ness and tripodism,
p89
aVit is not something
p90
aVdesigned to attach to your brain
p91
aVand suck out your thoughts.
p92
aVIt is in fact a citrus juicer
p93
aVand when I say that,
p94
aVyou never see it as anything else again.
p95
aa(lp96
VIt is also not a monument to design,
p97
aVit is a monument to design's utility.
p98
aVYou can take it home with you,
p99
aVunlike the Theme Building,
p100
aVwhich will stay where it is forever.
p101
aVThis is affordable
p102
aVand can come home with you
p103
aVand, as such, it can sit
p104
aVon your kitchen counter \u2014
p105
aVit can't go in your drawers;
p106
aVtrust me, I found that out the hard way \u2014
p107
aVand make your kitchen counter into
p108
aVa monument to design.
p109
aVOne other thing about it,
p110
aVif you do have one at home,
p111
aVlet me tell you one of the features you may not know:
p112
aVwhen you fall asleep,
p113
aVit comes alive
p114
aVand it walks around your house
p115
aVand goes through your mail
p116
aVand watches you as you sleep.
p117
aV(Applause)
p118
aa(lp119
VOkay, what is this object?
p120
aVI have no idea. I don't know what that thing is.
p121
aVIt looks terrible. Is it a little hot plate?
p122
aVI don't get it.
p123
aVDoes anyone know? Chi?
p124
aVIt's an ... iPhone. iPhone.
p125
aVOh yes, that's right, I remember those;
p126
aVI had my whole bathroom tiles
p127
aVredone with those back in the good old days.
p128
aa(lp129
VNo, I have an iPhone. Of course I do.
p130
aVHere is my well-loved iPhone.
p131
aVI do so many things on this little device.
p132
aVI like to read books on it.
p133
aVMore than that, I like to buy books on it
p134
aVthat I never have to feel guilty about not reading
p135
aVbecause they go in here and I never look at them again
p136
aVand it's perfect.
p137
aVI use it every day to
p138
aVmeasure the weight of an ox,
p139
aVfor example.
p140
aa(lp141
VEvery now and then,
p142
aVI admit that I complete
p143
aVa phone call on it occasionally.
p144
aVAnd yet I forget about it all the time.
p145
aVThis is a design
p146
aVthat once you saw it,
p147
aVyou forgot about it.
p148
aVIt is easy to forget the gasp-inducement
p149
aVthat occurred in 2007 when you first
p150
aVtouched this thing because it became
p151
aVso quickly pervasive
p152
aVand because of how instantly
p153
aVwe adopted these gestures
p154
aVand made it an extension of our life.
p155
aVUnlike the Theme Building,
p156
aVthis is not alien technology.
p157
aVOr I should say,
p158
aVwhat it did was it took technology
p159
aVwhich, unlike people in this room,
p160
aVto many other people in the world,
p161
aVstill feels very alien,
p162
aVand made it immediately and instantly feel
p163
aVfamiliar and intimate.
p164
aa(lp165
VAnd unlike the juicy salif,
p166
aVit does not threaten
p167
aVto attach itself to your brain,
p168
aVrather, it simply
p169
aVattaches itself to your brain.
p170
aV(Laughter)
p171
aVAnd you didn't even notice it happened.
p172
aVSo there you go. My name is John Hodgman.
p173
aVI just explained design.
p174
aVThank you very much.
