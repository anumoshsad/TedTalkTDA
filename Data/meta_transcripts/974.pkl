VWe are here today
p4
aVbecause [the] United Nations
p5
aVhave defined goals
p6
aVfor the progress of countries.
p7
aVThey're called Millennium Development Goals.
p8
aVAnd the reason I really like these goals
p9
aVis that there are eight of them.
p10
aVAnd by specifying eight different goals,
p11
aVthe United Nations has said
p12
aVthat there are so many things needed
p13
aVto change in a country
p14
aVin order to get the good life for people.
p15
aVLook here \u2014 you have to end poverty,
p16
aVeducation, gender,
p17
aVchild and maternal health,
p18
aVcontrol infections, protect the environment
p19
aVand get the good global links between nations
p20
aVin every aspect
p21
aVfrom aid to trade.
p22
aa(lp23
VThere's a second reason I like these development goals,
p24
aVand that is because each and every one is measured.
p25
aVTake child mortality;
p26
aVthe aim here is to reduce child mortality
p27
aVby two-thirds,
p28
aVfrom 1990 to 2015.
p29
aVThat's a four percent reduction per year \u2014
p30
aVand this, with measuring.
p31
aVThat's what makes the difference
p32
aVbetween political talking like this
p33
aVand really going for the important thing,
p34
aVa better life for people.
p35
aVAnd what I'm so happy about with this
p36
aVis that we have already documented
p37
aVthat there are many countries
p38
aVin Asia, in the Middle East,
p39
aVin Latin America and East Europe
p40
aVthat [are] reducing with this rate.
p41
aVAnd even mighty Brazil is going down with five percent per year,
p42
aVand Turkey with seven percent per year.
p43
aVSo there's good news.
p44
aVBut then I hear people saying, "There is no progress in Africa.
p45
aVAnd there's not even statistics on Africa
p46
aVto know what is happening."
p47
aVI'll prove them wrong on both points.
p48
aa(lp49
VCome with me to the wonderful world of statistics.
p50
aVI bring you to the webpage, ChildMortality.org,
p51
aVwhere you can take deaths in children
p52
aVbelow five years of age for all countries \u2014
p53
aVit's done by U.N. specialists.
p54
aVAnd I will take Kenya as an example.
p55
aVHere you see the data.
p56
aVDon't panic \u2014 don't panic now, I'll help you through this.
p57
aVIt looks nasty, like in college
p58
aVwhen you didn't like statistics.
p59
aVBut first thing, when you see dots like this,
p60
aVyou have to ask yourself:
p61
aVfrom where do the data come?
p62
aVWhat is the origin of the data?
p63
aVIs it so that in Kenya,
p64
aVthere are doctors and other specialists
p65
aVwho write the death certificate at the death of the child
p66
aVand it's sent to the statistical office?
p67
aVNo \u2014 low-income countries like Kenya
p68
aVstill don't have that level of organization.
p69
aVIt exists, but it's not complete
p70
aVbecause so many deaths occur in the home
p71
aVwith the family,
p72
aVand it's not registered.
p73
aVWhat we rely on is not an incomplete system.
p74
aVWe have interviews, we have surveys.
p75
aVAnd this is highly professional
p76
aVfemale interviewers
p77
aVwho sit down for one hour with a woman
p78
aVand ask her about [her] birth history.
p79
aVHow many children did you have?
p80
aVAre they alive?
p81
aVIf they died, at what age and what year?
p82
aVAnd then this is done in a representative sample
p83
aVof thousands of women in the country
p84
aVand put together in what used to be called
p85
aVa demographic health survey report.
p86
aVBut these surveys are costly,
p87
aVso they can only be done [in] three- to five-year intervals.
p88
aVBut they have good quality.
p89
aVSo this is a limitation.
p90
aVAnd all these colored lines here are results;
p91
aVeach color is one survey.
p92
aVBut that's too complicated for today, so I'll simplify it for you,
p93
aVand I give you one average point for each survey.
p94
aa(lp95
VThis was 1977, 1988,
p96
aV1992, '97
p97
aVand 2002.
p98
aVAnd when the experts in the U.N.
p99
aVhave got these surveys in place in their database,
p100
aVthen they use advanced mathematical formulas
p101
aVto produce a trend line, and the trend line looks like this.
p102
aVSee here \u2014 it's the best fit they can get of this point.
p103
aVBut watch out \u2014
p104
aVthey continue the line
p105
aVbeyond the last point
p106
aVout into nothing.
p107
aVAnd they estimated that in 2008,
p108
aVKenya had per child mortality of 128.
p109
aVAnd I was sad,
p110
aVbecause we could see
p111
aVthis reversal in Kenya
p112
aVwith an increased child mortality in the 90s.
p113
aVIt was so tragic.
p114
aVBut in June, I got a mail in my inbox
p115
aVfrom Demographic Health Surveys,
p116
aVand it showed good news from Kenya.
p117
aVI was so happy.
p118
aVThis was the estimate of the new survey.
p119
aVThen it just took another three months
p120
aVfor [the] U.N. to get it into their server,
p121
aVand on Friday we got the new trend line \u2014
p122
aVit was down here.
p123
aVIsn't it nice \u2014 isn't it nice, yeah?
p124
aVI was actually, on Friday, sitting in front of my computer,
p125
aVand I saw the death rate fall
p126
aVfrom 128 to 84 just that morning.
p127
aVSo we celebrated.
p128
aa(lp129
VBut now, when you have this trend line,
p130
aVhow do we measure progress?
p131
aVI'm going into some details here,
p132
aVbecause [the] U.N. do it like this.
p133
aVThey start [in] 1990 \u2014 they measure to 2009.
p134
aVThey say, "0.9 percent, no progress."
p135
aVThat's unfair.
p136
aVAs a professor, I think I have the right to propose something differently.
p137
aVI would say, at least do this \u2014
p138
aV10 years is enough to follow the trend.
p139
aVIt's two surveys, and you can see what's happening now.
p140
aVThey have 2.4 percent.
p141
aVHad I been in the Ministry of Health in Kenya,
p142
aVI may have joined these two points.
p143
aVSo what I'm telling you
p144
aVis that we know the child mortality.
p145
aVWe have a decent trend.
p146
aVIt's coming into some tricky things then
p147
aVwhen we are measuring MDGs.
p148
aVAnd the reason here for Africa is especially important,
p149
aVbecause '90s was a bad decade,
p150
aVnot only in Kenya, but across Africa.
p151
aVThe HIV epidemic peaked.
p152
aVThere was resistance for the old malaria drugs, until we got the new drugs.
p153
aVWe got, later, the mosquito netting.
p154
aVAnd there was socio-economic problems,
p155
aVwhich are now being solved at a much better scale.
p156
aVSo look at the average here \u2014
p157
aVthis is the average for all of sub-Saharan Africa.
p158
aVAnd [the] U.N. says
p159
aVit's a reduction with 1.8 percent.
p160
aa(lp161
VNow this sounds a little theoretical,
p162
aVbut it's not so theoretical.
p163
aVYou know, these economists,
p164
aVthey love money, they want more and more of it, they want it to grow.
p165
aVSo they calculate the percent annual growth rate of [the] economy.
p166
aVWe in public health, we hate child death,
p167
aVso we want less and less and less of child deaths.
p168
aVSo we calculate the percent reduction per year,
p169
aVbut it's sort of the same percentage.
p170
aVIf your economy grows with four percent,
p171
aVyou ought to reduce child mortality four percent;
p172
aVif it's used well and people are really involved
p173
aVand can get the use of the resources in the way they want it.
p174
aVSo is this fair now to measure this over 19 years?
p175
aVAn economist would never do that.
p176
aVI have just divided it into two periods.
p177
aVIn the 90s, only 1.2 percent,
p178
aVonly 1.2 percent.
p179
aVWhereas now, second gear \u2014
p180
aVit's like Africa had first gear,
p181
aVnow they go into second gear.
p182
aVBut even this
p183
aVis not a fair representation of Africa,
p184
aVbecause it's an average,
p185
aVit's an average speed of reduction in Africa.
p186
aa(lp187
VAnd look here when I take you into my bubble graphs.
p188
aVStill here,
p189
aVchild death per 1,000 on that axis.
p190
aVHere we have [the] year.
p191
aVAnd I'm now giving you a wider picture than the MDG.
p192
aVI start 50 years ago
p193
aVwhen Africa celebrated independence in most countries.
p194
aVI give you Congo, which was high,
p195
aVGhana \u2014 lower. And Kenya \u2014 even lower.
p196
aVAnd what has happened over the years since then? Here we go.
p197
aVYou can see, with independence, literacy improved
p198
aVand vaccinations started, smallpox was eradicated,
p199
aVhygiene was improved, and things got better.
p200
aVBut then, in the '80s, watch out here.
p201
aVCongo got into civil war,
p202
aVand they leveled off here.
p203
aVGhana got very ahead, fast.
p204
aVThis was the backlash in Kenya, and Ghana bypassed,
p205
aVbut then Kenya and Ghana go down together \u2014
p206
aVstill a standstill in Congo.
p207
aVThat's where we are today.
p208
aVYou can see it doesn't make sense
p209
aVto make an average of this zero improvement
p210
aVand this very fast improvement.
p211
aVTime has come
p212
aVto stop thinking about sub-Saharan Africa as one place.
p213
aVTheir countries are so different,
p214
aVand they merit to be recognized in the same way,
p215
aVas we don't talk about Europe as one place.
p216
aVI can tell you that the economy in Greece and Sweden are very different \u2014
p217
aVeveryone knows that.
p218
aVAnd they are judged, each country, on how they are doing.
p219
aa(lp220
VSo let me show the wider picture.
p221
aVMy country, Sweden:
p222
aV1800, we were up there.
p223
aVWhat a strange personality disorder we must have,
p224
aVcounting the children so meticulously in spite of a high child death rate.
p225
aVIt's very strange. It's sort of embarrassing.
p226
aVBut we had that habit in Sweden, you know,
p227
aVthat we counted all the child deaths,
p228
aVeven if we didn't do anything about it.
p229
aVAnd then, you see, these were famine years.
p230
aVThese were bad years, and people got fed up with Sweden.
p231
aVMy ancestors moved to the United States.
p232
aVAnd eventually, soon they started to get better and better here.
p233
aVAnd here we got better education, and we got health service,
p234
aVand child mortality came down.
p235
aVWe never had a war; Sweden was in peace all this time.
p236
aVBut look, the rate of lowering
p237
aVin Sweden
p238
aVwas not fast.
p239
aVSweden achieved a low child mortality
p240
aVbecause we started early.
p241
aVWe had primary school actually
p242
aVstarted in 1842.
p243
aVAnd then you get that wonderful effect
p244
aVwhen we got female literacy
p245
aVone generation later.
p246
aVYou have to realize that the investments we do in progress
p247
aVare long-term investments.
p248
aVIt's not about just five years \u2014
p249
aVit's long-term investments.
p250
aVAnd Sweden never reached [the] Millennium Development Goal rate,
p251
aV3.1 percent when I calculated.
p252
aVSo we are off track \u2014 that's what Sweden is.
p253
aVBut you don't talk about it so much.
p254
aVWe want others to be better than we were, and indeed, others have been better.
p255
aa(lp256
VLet me show you Thailand,
p257
aVsee what a success story, Thailand from the 1960s \u2014
p258
aVhow they went down here
p259
aVand reached almost the same child mortality levels as Sweden.
p260
aVAnd I'll give you another story \u2014 Egypt,
p261
aVthe most hidden, glorious success in public health.
p262
aVEgypt was up here in 1960,
p263
aVhigher than Congo.
p264
aVThe Nile Delta was a misery for children
p265
aVwith diarrheal disease
p266
aVand malaria and a lot of problems.
p267
aVAnd then they got the Aswan Dam. They got electricity in their homes,
p268
aVthey increased education
p269
aVand they got primary health care.
p270
aVAnd down they went, you know.
p271
aVAnd they got safer water, they eradicated malaria.
p272
aVAnd isn't it a success story.
p273
aVMillennium Development Goal rates for child mortality
p274
aVis fully possible.
p275
aVAnd the good thing is
p276
aVthat Ghana today is going with the same rate
p277
aVas Egypt did at its fastest.
p278
aVKenya is now speeding up.
p279
aVHere we have a problem.
p280
aVWe have a severe problem in countries which are at a standstill.
p281
aa(lp282
VNow, let me now bring you to a wider picture,
p283
aVa wider picture of child mortality.
p284
aVI'm going to show you the relationship
p285
aVbetween child mortality on this axis here \u2014
p286
aVthis axis here is child mortality \u2014
p287
aVand here I have the family size.
p288
aVThe relationship between child mortality and family size.
p289
aVOne, two, three, four children per woman:
p290
aVsix, seven, eight children per woman.
p291
aVThis is, once again, 1960 \u2014
p292
aV50 years ago.
p293
aVEach bubble is a country \u2014
p294
aVthe color, you can see, a continent.
p295
aVThe dark blue here is sub-Saharan Africa.
p296
aVAnd the size of the bubble is the population.
p297
aVAnd these are
p298
aVthe so-called "developing" countries.
p299
aVThey had high, or very high, child mortality
p300
aVand family size, six to eight.
p301
aVAnd the ones over there,
p302
aVthey were so-called Western countries.
p303
aVThey had low child mortality
p304
aVand small families.
p305
aVWhat has happened?
p306
aVWhat I want you [to do] now is to see with your own eyes
p307
aVthe relation between fall in child mortality
p308
aVand decrease in family size.
p309
aVI just want not to have any room for doubt \u2014
p310
aVyou have to see that for yourself.
p311
aVThis is what happened. Now I start the world.
p312
aVHere we come down with the eradication of
p313
aVsmallpox, better education,
p314
aVhealth service.
p315
aVIt got down there \u2014 China comes into the Western box here.
p316
aVAnd here Brazil is in the Western Box.
p317
aVIndia is approaching. The first African countries coming into the Western box,
p318
aVand we get a lot a new neighbors.
p319
aVWelcome to a decent life.
p320
aVCome on. We want everyone down there.
p321
aVThis is the vision we have, isn't it.
p322
aVAnd look now, the first African countries here are coming in.
p323
aVThere we are today.
p324
aa(lp325
VThere is no such thing
p326
aVas a "Western world" and "developing world."
p327
aVThis is the report from [the] U.N.,
p328
aVwhich came out on Friday.
p329
aVIt's very good \u2014 "Levels and Trends in Child Mortality" \u2014
p330
aVexcept this page.
p331
aVThis page is very bad;
p332
aVit's a categorization of countries.
p333
aVIt labels "developing countries," \u2014 I can read from the list here \u2014
p334
aVdeveloping countries: Republic of Korea \u2014 South Korea.
p335
aVHuh?
p336
aVThey get Samsung, how can they be [a] developing country?
p337
aVThey have here Singapore.
p338
aVThey have the lowest child mortality in the world, Singapore.
p339
aVThey bypassed Sweden five years ago,
p340
aVand they are labeled a developing country.
p341
aVThey have here Qatar.
p342
aVIt's the richest country in the world with Al Jazeera.
p343
aVHow the heck could they be [a] developing country?
p344
aVThis is crap.
p345
aV(Applause)
p346
aVThe rest here is good \u2014 the rest is good.
p347
aa(lp348
VWe have to have a modern concept,
p349
aVwhich fits to the data.
p350
aVAnd we have to realize
p351
aVthat we are all going to into this, down to here.
p352
aVWhat is the importance now with the relations here.
p353
aVLook \u2014 even if we look in Africa \u2014
p354
aVthese are the African countries.
p355
aVYou can clearly see the relation with falling child mortality
p356
aVand decreasing family size,
p357
aVeven within Africa.
p358
aVIt's very clear that this is what happens.
p359
aVAnd a very important piece of research came out on Friday
p360
aVfrom the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle
p361
aVshowing that almost 50 percent
p362
aVof the fall in child mortality
p363
aVcan be attributed to female education.
p364
aVThat is, when we get girls in school,
p365
aVwe'll get an impact 15 to 20 years later,
p366
aVwhich is a secular trend which is very strong.
p367
aVThat's why we must have that long-term perspective,
p368
aVbut we must measure the impact
p369
aVover 10-year periods.
p370
aVIt's fully possible
p371
aVto get child mortality down in all of these countries
p372
aVand to get them down in the corner
p373
aVwhere we all would like to live together.
p374
aa(lp375
VAnd of course, lowering child mortality
p376
aVis a matter of utmost importance
p377
aVfrom humanitarian aspects.
p378
aVIt's a decent life for children,
p379
aVwe are talking about.
p380
aVBut it is also a strategic investment
p381
aVin the future of all mankind,
p382
aVbecause it's about the environment.
p383
aVWe will not be able to manage the environment
p384
aVand avoid the terrible climate crisis
p385
aVif we don't stabilize the world population.
p386
aVLet's be clear about that.
p387
aVAnd the way to do that,
p388
aVthat is to get child mortality down, get access to family planning
p389
aVand behind that drive female education.
p390
aVAnd that is fully possible. Let's do it.
p391
