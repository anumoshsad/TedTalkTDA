V(Video) Newscaster: There's a large path of destruction here in town.
p4
aV... pulling trees from the ground, shattering windows,
p5
aVtaking the roofs off of homes ...
p6
aa(lp7
VCaitria O'Neill: That was me
p8
aVin front of our house in Monson, Massachusetts last June.
p9
aVAfter an EF3 tornado ripped straight through our town
p10
aVand took parts of our roof off,
p11
aVI decided to stay in Massachusetts,
p12
aVinstead of pursuing the master's program
p13
aVI had moved my boxes home that afternoon for.
p14
aa(lp15
VMorgan O'Neill: So, on June 1, we weren't disaster experts,
p16
aVbut on June 3, we started faking it.
p17
aVThis experience changed our lives,
p18
aVand now we're trying to change the experience.
p19
aa(lp20
VCO: So, tornadoes don't happen in Massachusetts,
p21
aVand I was cleverly standing in the front yard when one came over the hill.
p22
aVAfter a lamppost flew by, my family and I sprinted into the basement.
p23
aVTrees were thrown against the house, the windows exploded.
p24
aVWhen we finally got out the back door,
p25
aVtransformers were burning in the street.
p26
aa(lp27
VMO: I was here in Boston.
p28
aVI'm a PhD student at MIT,
p29
aVand I happen to study atmospheric science.
p30
aVActually, it gets weirder \u2014
p31
aVI was in the museum of science at the time the tornado hit,
p32
aVplaying with the tornado display \u2014
p33
aa(lp34
V(Laughter)
p35
aa(lp36
Vso I missed her call.
p37
aVI get a call from Caitria, hear the news, and start tracking the radar online
p38
aVto call the family back when another supercell was forming in their area.
p39
aVI drove home late that night with batteries and ice.
p40
aVWe live across the street from a historic church
p41
aVthat had lost its very iconic steeple in the storm.
p42
aVIt had become a community gathering place overnight.
p43
aVThe town hall and the police department had also suffered direct hits,
p44
aVand so people wanting to help or needing information went to the church.
p45
aa(lp46
VCO: We walked to the church because we heard they had hot meals,
p47
aVbut when we arrived, we found problems.
p48
aVThere were a couple large, sweaty men with chainsaws
p49
aVstanding in the center of the church, but nobody knew where to send them
p50
aVbecause no one knew the extent of the damage yet.
p51
aVAs we watched, they became frustrated and left
p52
aVto go find somebody to help on their own.
p53
aa(lp54
VMO: So we started organizing. Why? It had to be done.
p55
aVWe found Pastor Bob and offered to give the response some infrastructure.
p56
aVAnd then, armed with just two laptops and one air card,
p57
aVwe built a recovery machine.
p58
aa(lp59
V(Applause)
p60
aa(lp61
VCO: That was a tornado, and everyone's heading to the church
p62
aVto drop things off and volunteer.
p63
aa(lp64
VMO: Everyone's donating clothing.
p65
aVWe should inventory the donations piling up here.
p66
aa(lp67
VCO: And we need a hotline. Can you make a Google Voice number?
p68
aa(lp69
VMO: Sure. And we need to tell people what not to bring.
p70
aVI'll make a Facebook account. Can you print flyers?
p71
aa(lp72
VCO: Yeah, but we don't even know what houses are accepting help.
p73
aVWe need to canvas and send out volunteers.
p74
aa(lp75
VMO: We need to tell people what not to bring.
p76
aVHey, there's a news truck. I'll tell them.
p77
aVCO: You got my number off the news? We don't need more freezers!
p78
aa(lp79
V(Together) MO: Insurance won't cover it? CO: Juice boxes coming in an hour?
p80
aVTogether: Someone get me Post-its!
p81
aa(lp82
V(Laughter)
p83
aa(lp84
VCO: And then the rest of the community figured out that we had answers.
p85
aa(lp86
VMO: I can donate three water heaters, but someone needs to come pick them up.
p87
aa(lp88
VCO: My car is in my living room!
p89
aa(lp90
VMO: My boyscout troop would like to rebuild 12 mailboxes.
p91
aa(lp92
VCO: My puppy is missing and insurance doesn't cover chimneys.
p93
aa(lp94
VMO: My church group of 50 would like housing and meals for a week
p95
aVwhile we repair properties.
p96
aa(lp97
VCO: You sent me to that place on Washington Street yesterday,
p98
aVand now I'm covered in poison ivy.
p99
aa(lp100
V(Laughter)
p101
aa(lp102
VSo this is what filled our days.
p103
aVWe had to learn how to answer questions quickly
p104
aVand to solve problems in a minute or less;
p105
aVotherwise, something more urgent would come up,
p106
aVand it wouldn't get done.
p107
aa(lp108
VMO: We didn't get our authority from the board of selectmen
p109
aVor the emergency management director or the United Way.
p110
aVWe just started answering questions and making decisions
p111
aVbecause someone \u2014 anyone \u2014 had to.
p112
aVAnd why not me? I'm a campaign organizer.
p113
aVI'm good at Facebook.
p114
aVAnd there's two of me.
p115
aa(lp116
V(Laughter)
p117
aa(lp118
VCO: The point is, if there's a flood or a fire or a hurricane,
p119
aVyou, or somebody like you,
p120
aVare going to step up and start organizing things.
p121
aVThe other point is that it is hard.
p122
aa(lp123
VMO: Lying on the ground after another 17-hour day,
p124
aVCaitria and I would empty our pockets
p125
aVand try to place dozens of scraps of paper into context \u2014
p126
aVall bits of information that had to be remembered and matched
p127
aVin order to help someone.
p128
aVAfter another day and a shower at the shelter,
p129
aVwe realized it shouldn't be this hard.
p130
aa(lp131
VCO: In a country like ours where we breathe Wi-Fi,
p132
aVleveraging technology for a faster recovery should be a no-brainer.
p133
aVSystems like the ones that we were creating on the fly
p134
aVcould exist ahead of time.
p135
aVAnd if some community member is in this organizing position
p136
aVin every area after every disaster,
p137
aVthese tools should exist.
p138
aa(lp139
VMO: So, we decided to build them:
p140
aVa recovery in a box, something that could be deployed after every disaster
p141
aVby any local organizer.
p142
aa(lp143
VCO: I decided to stay in the country, give up the master's in Moscow
p144
aVand to work full-time to make this happen.
p145
aVIn the course of the past year,
p146
aVwe've become experts in the field of community-powered disaster recovery.
p147
aVAnd there are three main problems that we've observed
p148
aVwith the way things work currently.
p149
aa(lp150
VMO: The tools.
p151
aa(lp152
VLarge aid organizations are exceptional at bringing massive resources to bear
p153
aVafter a disaster,
p154
aVbut they often fulfill very specific missions, and then they leave.
p155
aVThis leaves local residents to deal with the thousands of spontaneous volunteers,
p156
aVthousands of donations,
p157
aVand all with no training and no tools.
p158
aVSo they use Post-its or Excel or Facebook.
p159
aVBut none of these tools allow you to value high-priority information
p160
aVamidst all of the photos and well-wishes.
p161
aa(lp162
VCO: The timing.
p163
aVDisaster relief is essentially a backwards political campaign.
p164
aVIn a political campaign, you start with no interest
p165
aVand no capacity to turn that into action.
p166
aVYou build both gradually,
p167
aVuntil a moment of peak mobilization at the time of the election.
p168
aVIn a disaster, however, you start with all of the interest
p169
aVand none of the capacity.
p170
aVAnd you've only got about seven days
p171
aVto capture 50 percent of all of the Web searches that will ever be made
p172
aVto help your area.
p173
aVThen some sporting event happens,
p174
aVand you've got only the resources that you've collected thus far
p175
aVto meet the next five years of recovery needs.
p176
aa(lp177
VThis is the slide for Katrina.
p178
aVThis is the curve for Joplin.
p179
aVAnd this is the curve for the Dallas tornadoes in April,
p180
aVwhere we deployed software.
p181
aVThere's a gap here.
p182
aVAffected households have to wait for the insurance adjuster to visit
p183
aVbefore they can start accepting help on their properties.
p184
aVAnd you've only got about four days of interest in Dallas.
p185
aa(lp186
VMO: Data.
p187
aVData is inherently unsexy,
p188
aVbut it can jump-start an area's recovery.
p189
aVFEMA and the state will pay 85 percent of the cost
p190
aVof a federally-declared disaster,
p191
aVleaving the town to pay the last 15 percent of the bill.
p192
aVNow that expense can be huge,
p193
aVbut if the town can mobilize X amount of volunteers for Y hours,
p194
aVthe dollar value of that labor used goes toward the town's contribution.
p195
aVBut who knows that?
p196
aVNow try to imagine the sinking feeling you get
p197
aVwhen you've just sent out 2,000 volunteers and you can't prove it.
p198
aa(lp199
VCO: These are three problems with a common solution.
p200
aVIf we can get the right tools at the right time
p201
aVto the people who will inevitably step up
p202
aVand start putting their communities back together,
p203
aVwe can create new standards in disaster recovery.
p204
aa(lp205
VMO: We needed canvasing tools, donations databasing,
p206
aVneeds reporting, remote volunteer access,
p207
aVall in an easy-to-use website.
p208
aa(lp209
VCO: And we needed help.
p210
aVAlvin, our software engineer and co-founder, has built these tools.
p211
aVChris and Bill have volunteered their time to use operations and partnerships.
p212
aVAnd we've been flying into disaster areas since this past January,
p213
aVsetting up software, training residents
p214
aVand licensing the software to areas that are preparing for disasters.
p215
aa(lp216
VMO: One of our first launches was after the Dallas tornadoes
p217
aVthis past April.
p218
aVWe flew into a town that had a static, outdated website
p219
aVand a frenetic Facebook feed, trying to structure the response,
p220
aVand we launched our platform.
p221
aVAll of the interest came in the first four days,
p222
aVbut by the time they lost the news cycle,
p223
aVthat's when the needs came in,
p224
aVyet they had this massive resource of what people were able to give
p225
aVand they've been able to meet the needs of their residents.
p226
aa(lp227
VCO: So it's working, but it could be better.
p228
aVEmergency preparedness is a big deal in disaster recovery
p229
aVbecause it makes towns safer and more resilient.
p230
aVImagine if we could have these systems ready to go in a place
p231
aVbefore a disaster.
p232
aVSo that's what we're working on.
p233
aVWe're working on getting the software to places so people expect it,
p234
aVso people know how to use it
p235
aVand so it can be filled ahead of time
p236
aVwith that micro-information that drives recovery.
p237
aa(lp238
VMO: It's not rocket science.
p239
aVThese tools are obvious and people want them.
p240
aVIn our hometown, we trained a half-dozen residents
p241
aVto run these Web tools on their own,
p242
aVbecause Caitria and I live here, in Boston.
p243
aVThey took to it immediately, and now they are forces of nature.
p244
aVThere are over three volunteer groups working almost every day,
p245
aVand have been since June 1 of last year,
p246
aVto make sure these residents get what they need and get back in their homes.
p247
aVThey have hotlines and spreadsheets and data.
p248
aa(lp249
VCO: And that makes a difference.
p250
aVJune 1 this year marked the one-year anniversary of the Monson tornado,
p251
aVand our community's never been more connected or more empowered.
p252
aVWe've been able to see the same transformation in Texas and in Alabama.
p253
aVBecause it doesn't take Harvard or MIT
p254
aVto fly in and fix problems after a disaster;
p255
aVit takes a local.
p256
aVNo matter how good an aid organization is at what they do,
p257
aVthey eventually have to go home.
p258
aVBut if you give locals the tools,
p259
aVif you show them what they can do to recover,
p260
aVthey become experts.
p261
aa(lp262
V(Applause)
p263
aa(lp264
