VA few months ago,
p4
aVa 40 year-old woman came to an emergency room
p5
aVin a hospital close to where I live,
p6
aVand she was brought in confused.
p7
aVHer blood pressure was an alarming
p8
aV230 over 170.
p9
aVWithin a few minutes, she went into cardiac collapse.
p10
aVShe was resuscitated, stabilized,
p11
aVwhisked over to a CAT scan suite
p12
aVright next to the emergency room,
p13
aVbecause they were concerned about blood clots in the lung.
p14
aVAnd the CAT scan revealed
p15
aVno blood clots in the lung,
p16
aVbut it showed bilateral, visible, palpable breast masses,
p17
aVbreast tumors,
p18
aVthat had metastasized widely
p19
aVall over the body.
p20
aVAnd the real tragedy was, if you look through her records,
p21
aVshe had been seen
p22
aVin four or five other health care institutions
p23
aVin the preceding two years.
p24
aVFour or five opportunities
p25
aVto see the breast masses, touch the breast mass,
p26
aVintervene at a much earlier stage
p27
aVthan when we saw her.
p28
aa(lp29
VLadies and gentlemen,
p30
aVthat is not an unusual story.
p31
aVUnfortunately, it happens all the time.
p32
aVI joke, but I only half joke,
p33
aVthat if you come to one of our hospitals missing a limb,
p34
aVno one will believe you till they get a CAT scan, MRI
p35
aVor orthopedic consult.
p36
aVI am not a Luddite.
p37
aVI teach at Stanford.
p38
aVI'm a physician practicing with cutting-edge technology.
p39
aVBut I'd like to make the case to you
p40
aVin the next 17 minutes
p41
aVthat when we shortcut the physical exam,
p42
aVwhen we lean towards ordering tests
p43
aVinstead of talking to and examining the patient,
p44
aVwe not only overlook simple diagnoses
p45
aVthat can be diagnosed at a treatable, early stage,
p46
aVbut we're losing much more than that.
p47
aVWe're losing a ritual.
p48
aVWe're losing a ritual that I believe is transformative, transcendent,
p49
aVand is at the heart
p50
aVof the patient-physician relationship.
p51
aVThis may actually be heresy to say this at TED,
p52
aVbut I'd like to introduce you
p53
aVto the most important innovation,
p54
aVI think, in medicine
p55
aVto come in the next 10 years,
p56
aVand that is the power of the human hand \u2014
p57
aVto touch, to comfort, to diagnose
p58
aVand to bring about treatment.
p59
aa(lp60
VI'd like to introduce you first to this person
p61
aVwhose image you may or may not recognize.
p62
aVThis is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
p63
aVSince we're in Edinburgh, I'm a big fan of Conan Doyle.
p64
aVYou might not know that Conan Doyle went to medical school
p65
aVhere in Edinburgh,
p66
aVand his character, Sherlock Holmes,
p67
aVwas inspired by Sir Joseph Bell.
p68
aVJoseph Bell was an extraordinary teacher by all accounts.
p69
aVAnd Conan Doyle, writing about Bell,
p70
aVdescribed the following exchange
p71
aVbetween Bell and his students.
p72
aa(lp73
VSo picture Bell sitting in the outpatient department,
p74
aVstudents all around him,
p75
aVpatients signing up in the emergency room
p76
aVand being registered and being brought in.
p77
aVAnd a woman comes in with a child,
p78
aVand Conan Doyle describes the following exchange.
p79
aVThe woman says, "Good Morning."
p80
aVBell says, "What sort of crossing did you have
p81
aVon the ferry from Burntisland?"
p82
aVShe says, "It was good."
p83
aVAnd he says, "What did you do with the other child?"
p84
aVShe says, "I left him with my sister at Leith."
p85
aVAnd he says,
p86
aV"And did you take the shortcut down Inverleith Row
p87
aVto get here to the infirmary?"
p88
aVShe says, "I did."
p89
aVAnd he says, "Would you still be working at the linoleum factory?"
p90
aVAnd she says, "I am."
p91
aa(lp92
VAnd Bell then goes on to explain to the students.
p93
aVHe says, "You see, when she said, 'Good morning,'
p94
aVI picked up her Fife accent.
p95
aVAnd the nearest ferry crossing from Fife is from Burntisland.
p96
aVAnd so she must have taken the ferry over.
p97
aVYou notice that the coat she's carrying
p98
aVis too small for the child who is with her,
p99
aVand therefore, she started out the journey with two children,
p100
aVbut dropped one off along the way.
p101
aVYou notice the clay on the soles of her feet.
p102
aVSuch red clay is not found within a hundred miles of Edinburgh,
p103
aVexcept in the botanical gardens.
p104
aVAnd therefore, she took a short cut down Inverleith Row
p105
aVto arrive here.
p106
aVAnd finally, she has a dermatitis
p107
aVon the fingers of her right hand,
p108
aVa dermatitis that is unique
p109
aVto the linoleum factory workers in Burntisland."
p110
aVAnd when Bell actually strips the patient,
p111
aVbegins to examine the patient,
p112
aVyou can only imagine how much more he would discern.
p113
aVAnd as a teacher of medicine, as a student myself,
p114
aVI was so inspired by that story.
p115
aa(lp116
VBut you might not realize
p117
aVthat our ability to look into the body
p118
aVin this simple way, using our senses,
p119
aVis quite recent.
p120
aVThe picture I'm showing you is of Leopold Auenbrugger
p121
aVwho, in the late 1700s,
p122
aVdiscovered percussion.
p123
aVAnd the story is that Leopold Auenbrugger
p124
aVwas the son of an innkeeper.
p125
aVAnd his father used to go down into the basement
p126
aVto tap on the sides of casks of wine
p127
aVto determine how much wine was left
p128
aVand whether to reorder.
p129
aVAnd so when Auenbrugger became a physician,
p130
aVhe began to do the same thing.
p131
aVHe began to tap on the chests of his patients,
p132
aVon their abdomens.
p133
aVAnd basically everything we know about percussion,
p134
aVwhich you can think of as an ultrasound of its day \u2014
p135
aVorgan enlargement, fluid around the heart, fluid in the lungs,
p136
aVabdominal changes \u2014
p137
aVall of this he described in this wonderful manuscript
p138
aV"Inventum Novum," "New Invention,"
p139
aVwhich would have disappeared into obscurity,
p140
aVexcept for the fact that this physician, Corvisart,
p141
aVa famous French physician \u2014
p142
aVfamous only because he was physician to this gentleman \u2014
p143
aVCorvisart repopularized and reintroduced the work.
p144
aa(lp145
VAnd it was followed a year or two later
p146
aVby Laennec discovering the stethoscope.
p147
aVLaennec, it is said, was walking in the streets of Paris
p148
aVand saw two children playing with a stick.
p149
aVOne was scratching at the end of the stick,
p150
aVanother child listened at the other end.
p151
aVAnd Laennec thought this would be a wonderful way
p152
aVto listen to the chest or listen to the abdomen
p153
aVusing what he called "the cylinder."
p154
aVLater he renamed it the stethoscope.
p155
aVAnd that is how stethoscope and auscultation was born.
p156
aVSo within a few years,
p157
aVin the late 1800s, early 1900s,
p158
aVall of a sudden,
p159
aVthe barber surgeon had given way
p160
aVto the physician who was trying to make a diagnosis.
p161
aa(lp162
VIf you'll recall, prior to that time,
p163
aVno matter what ailed you, you went to see the barber surgeon
p164
aVwho wound up cupping you,
p165
aVbleeding you, purging you.
p166
aVAnd, oh yes, if you wanted,
p167
aVhe would give you a haircut \u2014 short on the sides, long in the back \u2014
p168
aVand pull your tooth while he was at it.
p169
aVHe made no attempt at diagnosis.
p170
aVIn fact, some of you might well know
p171
aVthat the barber pole, the red and white stripes,
p172
aVrepresents the blood bandages of the barber surgeon,
p173
aVand the receptacles on either end
p174
aVrepresent the pots in which the blood was collected.
p175
aVBut the arrival of auscultation and percussion
p176
aVrepresented a sea change,
p177
aVa moment when physicians were beginning to look inside the body.
p178
aa(lp179
VAnd this particular painting, I think,
p180
aVrepresents the pinnacle, the peak, of that clinical era.
p181
aVThis is a very famous painting:
p182
aV"The Doctor" by Luke Fildes.
p183
aVLuke Fildes was commissioned to paint this by Tate,
p184
aVwho then established the Tate Gallery.
p185
aVAnd Tate asked Fildes to paint a painting
p186
aVof social importance.
p187
aVAnd it's interesting that Fildes picked this topic.
p188
aVFildes' oldest son, Philip,
p189
aVdied at the age of nine on Christmas Eve
p190
aVafter a brief illness.
p191
aVAnd Fildes was so taken by the physician
p192
aVwho held vigil at the bedside for two, three nights,
p193
aVthat he decided that he would try and depict
p194
aVthe physician in our time \u2014
p195
aValmost a tribute to this physician.
p196
aVAnd hence the painting "The Doctor," a very famous painting.
p197
aVIt's been on calendars, postage stamps in many different countries.
p198
aVI've often wondered, what would Fildes have done
p199
aVhad he been asked to paint this painting
p200
aVin the modern era,
p201
aVin the year 2011?
p202
aVWould he have substituted a computer screen
p203
aVfor where he had the patient?
p204
aa(lp205
VI've gotten into some trouble in Silicon Valley
p206
aVfor saying that the patient in the bed
p207
aVhas almost become an icon
p208
aVfor the real patient who's in the computer.
p209
aVI've actually coined a term for that entity in the computer.
p210
aVI call it the iPatient.
p211
aVThe iPatient is getting wonderful care all across America.
p212
aVThe real patient often wonders,
p213
aVwhere is everyone?
p214
aVWhen are they going to come by and explain things to me?
p215
aVWho's in charge?
p216
aVThere's a real disjunction between the patient's perception
p217
aVand our own perceptions as physicians of the best medical care.
p218
aa(lp219
VI want to show you a picture
p220
aVof what rounds looked like
p221
aVwhen I was in training.
p222
aVThe focus was around the patient.
p223
aVWe went from bed to bed. The attending physician was in charge.
p224
aVToo often these days,
p225
aVrounds look very much like this,
p226
aVwhere the discussion is taking place
p227
aVin a room far away from the patient.
p228
aVThe discussion is all about images on the computer, data.
p229
aVAnd the one critical piece missing
p230
aVis that of the patient.
p231
aa(lp232
VNow I've been influenced in this thinking
p233
aVby two anecdotes that I want to share with you.
p234
aVOne had to do with a friend of mine who had a breast cancer,
p235
aVhad a small breast cancer detected \u2014
p236
aVhad her lumpectomy in the town in which I lived.
p237
aVThis is when I was in Texas.
p238
aVAnd she then spent a lot of time researching
p239
aVto find the best cancer center in the world
p240
aVto get her subsequent care.
p241
aVAnd she found the place and decided to go there, went there.
p242
aVWhich is why I was surprised a few months later
p243
aVto see her back in our own town,
p244
aVgetting her subsequent care with her private oncologist.
p245
aa(lp246
VAnd I pressed her, and I asked her,
p247
aV"Why did you come back and get your care here?"
p248
aVAnd she was reluctant to tell me.
p249
aVShe said, "The cancer center was wonderful.
p250
aVIt had a beautiful facility,
p251
aVgiant atrium, valet parking,
p252
aVa piano that played itself,
p253
aVa concierge that took you around from here to there.
p254
aVBut," she said,
p255
aV"but they did not touch my breasts."
p256
aVNow you and I could argue
p257
aVthat they probably did not need to touch her breasts.
p258
aVThey had her scanned inside out.
p259
aVThey understood her breast cancer at the molecular level;
p260
aVthey had no need to touch her breasts.
p261
aa(lp262
VBut to her, it mattered deeply.
p263
aVIt was enough for her to make the decision
p264
aVto get her subsequent care with her private oncologist
p265
aVwho, every time she went,
p266
aVexamined both breasts including the axillary tail,
p267
aVexamined her axilla carefully,
p268
aVexamined her cervical region, her inguinal region,
p269
aVdid a thorough exam.
p270
aVAnd to her, that spoke of a kind of attentiveness that she needed.
p271
aVI was very influenced by that anecdote.
p272
aa(lp273
VI was also influenced by another experience that I had,
p274
aVagain, when I was in Texas, before I moved to Stanford.
p275
aVI had a reputation
p276
aVas being interested in patients
p277
aVwith chronic fatigue.
p278
aVThis is not a reputation you would wish on your worst enemy.
p279
aVI say that because these are difficult patients.
p280
aVThey have often been rejected by their families,
p281
aVhave had bad experiences with medical care
p282
aVand they come to you fully prepared
p283
aVfor you to join the long list of people
p284
aVwho's about to disappoint them.
p285
aVAnd I learned very early on with my first patient
p286
aVthat I could not do justice
p287
aVto this very complicated patient
p288
aVwith all the records they were bringing
p289
aVin a new patient visit of 45 minutes.
p290
aVThere was just no way.
p291
aVAnd if I tried, I'd disappoint them.
p292
aa(lp293
VAnd so I hit on this method
p294
aVwhere I invited the patient
p295
aVto tell me the story for their entire first visit,
p296
aVand I tried not to interrupt them.
p297
aVWe know the average American physician
p298
aVinterrupts their patient in 14 seconds.
p299
aVAnd if I ever get to heaven,
p300
aVit will be because I held my piece for 45 minutes
p301
aVand did not interrupt my patient.
p302
aVI then scheduled the physical exam for two weeks hence,
p303
aVand when the patient came for the physical,
p304
aVI was able to do a thorough physical,
p305
aVbecause I had nothing else to do.
p306
aVI like to think that I do a thorough physical exam,
p307
aVbut because the whole visit was now about the physical,
p308
aVI could do an extraordinarily thorough exam.
p309
aa(lp310
VAnd I remember my very first patient in that series
p311
aVcontinued to tell me more history
p312
aVduring what was meant to be the physical exam visit.
p313
aVAnd I began my ritual.
p314
aVI always begin with the pulse,
p315
aVthen I examine the hands, then I look at the nail beds,
p316
aVthen I slide my hand up to the epitrochlear node,
p317
aVand I was into my ritual.
p318
aVAnd when my ritual began,
p319
aVthis very voluble patient
p320
aVbegan to quiet down.
p321
aVAnd I remember having a very eerie sense
p322
aVthat the patient and I
p323
aVhad slipped back into a primitive ritual
p324
aVin which I had a role
p325
aVand the patient had a role.
p326
aVAnd when I was done,
p327
aVthe patient said to me with some awe,
p328
aV"I have never been examined like this before."
p329
aVNow if that were true,
p330
aVit's a true condemnation of our health care system,
p331
aVbecause they had been seen in other places.
p332
aa(lp333
VI then proceeded to tell the patient,
p334
aVonce the patient was dressed,
p335
aVthe standard things that the person must have heard in other institutions,
p336
aVwhich is, "This is not in your head.
p337
aVThis is real.
p338
aVThe good news, it's not cancer, it's not tuberculosis,
p339
aVit's not coccidioidomycosis or some obscure fungal infection.
p340
aVThe bad news is we don't know exactly what's causing this,
p341
aVbut here's what you should do, here's what we should do."
p342
aVAnd I would lay out all the standard treatment options
p343
aVthat the patient had heard elsewhere.
p344
aa(lp345
VAnd I always felt
p346
aVthat if my patient gave up the quest
p347
aVfor the magic doctor, the magic treatment
p348
aVand began with me on a course towards wellness,
p349
aVit was because I had earned the right
p350
aVto tell them these things
p351
aVby virtue of the examination.
p352
aVSomething of importance had transpired in the exchange.
p353
aVI took this to my colleagues
p354
aVat Stanford in anthropology
p355
aVand told them the same story.
p356
aVAnd they immediately said to me,
p357
aV"Well you are describing a classic ritual."
p358
aVAnd they helped me understand
p359
aVthat rituals are all about transformation.
p360
aa(lp361
VWe marry, for example,
p362
aVwith great pomp and ceremony and expense
p363
aVto signal our departure
p364
aVfrom a life of solitude and misery and loneliness
p365
aVto one of eternal bliss.
p366
aVI'm not sure why you're laughing.
p367
aVThat was the original intent, was it not?
p368
aVWe signal transitions of power
p369
aVwith rituals.
p370
aVWe signal the passage of a life with rituals.
p371
aVRituals are terribly important.
p372
aVThey're all about transformation.
p373
aVWell I would submit to you
p374
aVthat the ritual
p375
aVof one individual coming to another
p376
aVand telling them things
p377
aVthat they would not tell their preacher or rabbi,
p378
aVand then, incredibly on top of that,
p379
aVdisrobing and allowing touch \u2014
p380
aVI would submit to you that that is a ritual of exceeding importance.
p381
aVAnd if you shortchange that ritual
p382
aVby not undressing the patient,
p383
aVby listening with your stethoscope on top of the nightgown,
p384
aVby not doing a complete exam,
p385
aVyou have bypassed on the opportunity
p386
aVto seal the patient-physician relationship.
p387
aa(lp388
VI am a writer,
p389
aVand I want to close by reading you a short passage that I wrote
p390
aVthat has to do very much with this scene.
p391
aVI'm an infectious disease physician,
p392
aVand in the early days of HIV, before we had our medications,
p393
aVI presided over so many scenes like this.
p394
aVI remember, every time I went to a patient's deathbed,
p395
aVwhether in the hospital or at home,
p396
aVI remember my sense of failure \u2014
p397
aVthe feeling of I don't know what I have to say;
p398
aVI don't know what I can say;
p399
aVI don't know what I'm supposed to do.
p400
aVAnd out of that sense of failure,
p401
aVI remember, I would always examine the patient.
p402
aVI would pull down the eyelids.
p403
aVI would look at the tongue.
p404
aVI would percuss the chest. I would listen to the heart.
p405
aVI would feel the abdomen.
p406
aVI remember so many patients,
p407
aVtheir names still vivid on my tongue,
p408
aVtheir faces still so clear.
p409
aVI remember so many huge, hollowed out, haunted eyes
p410
aVstaring up at me as I performed this ritual.
p411
aVAnd then the next day,
p412
aVI would come, and I would do it again.
p413
aa(lp414
VAnd I wanted to read you this one closing passage
p415
aVabout one patient.
p416
aV"I recall one patient
p417
aVwho was at that point
p418
aVno more than a skeleton
p419
aVencased in shrinking skin,
p420
aVunable to speak,
p421
aVhis mouth crusted with candida
p422
aVthat was resistant to the usual medications.
p423
aVWhen he saw me
p424
aVon what turned out to be his last hours on this earth,
p425
aVhis hands moved as if in slow motion.
p426
aVAnd as I wondered what he was up to,
p427
aVhis stick fingers made their way
p428
aVup to his pajama shirt,
p429
aVfumbling with his buttons.
p430
aVI realized that he was wanting
p431
aVto expose his wicker-basket chest to me.
p432
aVIt was an offering, an invitation.
p433
aVI did not decline.
p434
aa(lp435
VI percussed. I palpated. I listened to the chest.
p436
aVI think he surely must have known by then
p437
aVthat it was vital for me
p438
aVjust as it was necessary for him.
p439
aVNeither of us could skip this ritual,
p440
aVwhich had nothing to do with detecting rales in the lung,
p441
aVor finding the gallop rhythm of heart failure.
p442
aVNo, this ritual was about the one message
p443
aVthat physicians have needed to convey to their patients.
p444
aVAlthough, God knows, of late, in our hubris,
p445
aVwe seem to have drifted away.
p446
aVWe seem to have forgotten \u2014
p447
aVas though, with the explosion of knowledge,
p448
aVthe whole human genome mapped out at our feet,
p449
aVwe are lulled into inattention,
p450
aVforgetting that the ritual is cathartic to the physician,
p451
aVnecessary for the patient \u2014
p452
aVforgetting that the ritual has meaning
p453
aVand a singular message to convey to the patient.
p454
aa(lp455
VAnd the message, which I didn't fully understand then,
p456
aVeven as I delivered it,
p457
aVand which I understand better now is this:
p458
aVI will always, always, always be there.
p459
aVI will see you through this.
p460
aVI will never abandon you.
p461
aVI will be with you through the end."
p462
aa(lp463
VThank you very much.
p464
aa(lp465
V(Applause)
