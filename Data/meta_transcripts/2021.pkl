VSix months ago, I got an email
p4
aVfrom a man in Israel
p5
aVwho had read one of my books,
p6
aVand the email said,
p7
aV"You don't know me,
p8
aVbut I'm your 12th cousin."
p9
aVAnd it said, "I have a family tree
p10
aVwith 80,000 people on it, including you,
p11
aVKarl Marx,
p12
aVand several European aristocrats."
p13
aVNow I did not know what to make of this.
p14
aVPart of me was like, okay,
p15
aVwhen's he going to ask me to wire
p16
aV10,000 dollars to his Nigerian bank, right?
p17
aVI also thought, 80,000 relatives,
p18
aVdo I want that?
p19
aVI have enough trouble with some of the ones
p20
aVI have already.
p21
aVAnd I won't name names, but you know who you are.
p22
aVBut another part of me said, this is remarkable.
p23
aVHere I am alone in my office, but I'm not alone at all.
p24
aVI'm connected to 80,000 people around the world,
p25
aVand that's four Madison Square Gardens
p26
aVfull of cousins.
p27
aVAnd some of them are going to be great,
p28
aVand some of them are going to be irritating,
p29
aVbut they're all related to me.
p30
aa(lp31
VSo this email inspired me to dive into genealogy,
p32
aVwhich I always thought was a very staid and proper field,
p33
aVbut it turns out it's going through a fascinating
p34
aVrevolution, and a controversial one.
p35
aVPartly, this is because of DNA and genetic testing,
p36
aVbut partly, it's because of the Internet.
p37
aVThere are sites that now take
p38
aVthe Wikipedia approach to family trees,
p39
aVcollaboration and crowdsourcing,
p40
aVand what you do is,
p41
aVyou load your family tree on,
p42
aVand then these sites search
p43
aVto see if the A.J. Jacobs in your tree
p44
aVis the same as the A.J. Jacobs in another tree,
p45
aVand if it is, then you can combine,
p46
aVand then you combine and combine and combine
p47
aVuntil you get these massive,
p48
aVmega-family trees
p49
aVwith thousands of people on them,
p50
aVor even millions.
p51
aVI'm on something on Geni called
p52
aVthe world family tree,
p53
aVwhich has no less than a jaw-dropping
p54
aV75 million people.
p55
aVSo that's 75 million people connected by blood
p56
aVor marriage, sometimes both.
p57
aV(Laughter)
p58
aVIt's in all seven continents, including Antarctica.
p59
aVI'm on it. Many of you are on it,
p60
aVwhether you know it or not,
p61
aVand you can see the links.
p62
aVHere's my cousin Gwyneth Paltrow.
p63
aVShe has no idea I exist,
p64
aVbut we are officially cousins.
p65
aVWe have just 17 links between us.
p66
aa(lp67
VAnd there's my cousin Barack Obama.
p68
aV(Laughter)
p69
aVAnd he is my aunt's fifth great-aunt's husband's
p70
aVfather's wife's seventh great-nephew,
p71
aVso practically my old brother.
p72
aa(lp73
VAnd my cousin, of course,
p74
aVthe actor Kevin Bacon \u2014
p75
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p76
aVwho is my first cousin's twice removed's
p77
aVwife's niece's husband's first cousin once removed's
p78
aVniece's husband.
p79
aVSo six degrees of Kevin Bacon,
p80
aVplus or minus several degrees.
p81
aa(lp82
VNow, I'm not boasting, because all of you
p83
aVhave famous people and historical figures
p84
aVin your tree, because we are all connected,
p85
aVand 75 million may seem like a lot,
p86
aVbut in a few years, it's quite likely
p87
aVwe will have a family tree
p88
aVwith all, almost all, seven billion people on Earth.
p89
aa(lp90
VBut does it really matter?
p91
aVWhat's the importance?
p92
aVAnd I do think it is important,
p93
aVand I'll give you five reasons why, really quickly.
p94
aa(lp95
VFirst, it's got scientific value.
p96
aVThis is an unprecedented history of the human race,
p97
aVand it's giving us valuable data
p98
aVabout how diseases are inherited,
p99
aVhow people migrate,
p100
aVand there's a team of scientists at MIT right now
p101
aVstudying the world family tree.
p102
aa(lp103
VNumber two, it brings history alive.
p104
aVI found out I'm connected to Albert Einstein,
p105
aVso I told my seven-year-old son that,
p106
aVand he was totally engaged.
p107
aVNow Albert Einstein is not some dead white guy
p108
aVwith weird hair.
p109
aVHe's Uncle Albert. (Laughter)
p110
aVAnd my son wanted to know,
p111
aV"What did he say? What is E = MC squared?"
p112
aVAlso, it's not all good news.
p113
aVI found a link to Jeffrey Dahmer, the serial killer,
p114
aVbut I will say that's on my wife's side.
p115
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p116
aVSo I want to make that clear. Sorry, honey.
p117
aa(lp118
VNumber three, interconnectedness.
p119
aVWe all come from the same ancestor,
p120
aVand you don't have to believe the literal Bible version,
p121
aVbut scientists talk about Y chromosomal Adam
p122
aVand mitochondrial Eve,
p123
aVand these were about 100,000 to 300,000 years ago.
p124
aVWe all have a bit of their DNA in us.
p125
aVThey are our great-great-great-great-great-great \u2014
p126
aVcontinue that for about 7,000 times \u2014
p127
aVgrandparents,
p128
aVand so that means we literally all are
p129
aVbiological cousins as well,
p130
aVand estimates vary, but probably
p131
aVthe farthest cousin you have on Earth
p132
aVis about a 50th cousin.
p133
aVNow, it's not just ancestors we share, descendants.
p134
aVIf you have kids, and they have kids,
p135
aVlook how quickly the descendants accumulate.
p136
aVSo in 10, 12 generations,
p137
aVyou're going to have thousands of offspring,
p138
aVand millions of offspring.
p139
aa(lp140
VNumber four, a kinder world.
p141
aVNow, I know that there are family feuds.
p142
aVI have three sons, so I see how they fight.
p143
aVBut I think that there's also a human bias
p144
aVto treat your family a little better than strangers.
p145
aVI think this tree is going to be bad news for bigots,
p146
aVbecause they're going to have to realize
p147
aVthat they are cousins with thousands of people
p148
aVin whatever ethnic group they happen
p149
aVto have issues with,
p150
aVand I think you look back at history,
p151
aVand a lot of the terrible things we've done to each other
p152
aVis because one group thinks another group is sub-human,
p153
aVand you can't do that anymore.
p154
aVWe're not just part of the same species.
p155
aVWe're part of the same family.
p156
aVWe share 99.9 percent of our DNA.
p157
aa(lp158
VNow the final one is number five,
p159
aVa democratizing effect.
p160
aVSome genealogy has an elitist strain,
p161
aVlike people say, "Oh, I'm descended
p162
aVfrom Mary Queen of Scots
p163
aVand you're not, so you cannot join my country club."
p164
aVBut that's really going to be hard to do now,
p165
aVbecause everyone is related.
p166
aVI'm descended from Mary Queen of Scots \u2014
p167
aVby marriage, but still.
p168
aa(lp169
VSo it's really a fascinating time
p170
aVin the history of family,
p171
aVbecause it's changing so fast.
p172
aVThere is gay marriage and sperm donors
p173
aVand there's intermarriage on an unprecedented scale,
p174
aVand this makes some of my more conservative cousins
p175
aVa little nervous,
p176
aVbut I actually think it's a good thing.
p177
aVI think the more inclusive the idea of family is,
p178
aVthe better,
p179
aVbecause then you have more potential caretakers,
p180
aVand as my aunt's eighth cousin twice removed
p181
aVHillary Clinton says \u2014
p182
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p183
aVit takes a village.
p184
aa(lp185
VSo I have all these hundreds and thousands,
p186
aVmillions of new cousins.
p187
aVI thought, what can I do with this information?
p188
aVAnd that's when I decided,
p189
aVwhy not throw a party?
p190
aVSo that's what I'm doing.
p191
aVAnd you're all invited.
p192
aVNext year, next summer,
p193
aVI will be hosting what I hope is
p194
aVthe biggest and best family reunion in history.
p195
aV(Applause)
p196
aVThank you. I want you there.
p197
aVI want you there.
p198
aVIt's going to be at the New York Hall of Science,
p199
aVwhich is a great venue,
p200
aVbut it's also on the site of the former World's Fair,
p201
aVwhich is, I think, very appropriate,
p202
aVbecause I see this as a family reunion
p203
aVmeets a world's fair.
p204
aVThere's going to be exhibits and food, music.
p205
aVPaul McCartney is 11 steps away,
p206
aVso I'm hoping he brings his guitar.
p207
aVHe hasn't RSVP'd yet, but fingers crossed.
p208
aVAnd there is going to be a day of speakers,
p209
aVof fascinating cousins.
p210
aVIt's early, but I've already,
p211
aVI've got some lined up.
p212
aVCass Sunstein, my cousin who is perhaps
p213
aVthe most brilliant legal scholar, will be talking.
p214
aVHe was a former member of the Obama administration.
p215
aVAnd on the other side of the political spectrum,
p216
aVGeorge H.W. Bush, number 41, the father,
p217
aVhe has agreed to participate,
p218
aVand Nick Kroll, the comedian,
p219
aVand Dr. Oz, and many more to come.
p220
aVAnd, of course, the most important is that you,
p221
aVI want you guys there,
p222
aVand I invite you to go to GlobalFamilyReunion.org
p223
aVand figure out how you're on the family tree,
p224
aVbecause these are big issues, family and tribe,
p225
aVand I don't know all the answers,
p226
aVbut I have a lot of smart relatives,
p227
aVincluding you guys,
p228
aVso together, I think we can figure it out.
p229
aVOnly together can we solve these big problems.
p230
aVSo from cousin to cousin,
p231
aVI thank you. I can't wait to see you.
p232
aVGoodbye.
