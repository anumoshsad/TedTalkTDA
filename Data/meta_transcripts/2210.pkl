VI have a confession to make.
p4
aVI'm a business professor
p5
aVwhose ambition has been to help people learn to lead.
p6
aVBut recently, I've discovered
p7
aVthat what many of us think of as great leadership
p8
aVdoes not work when it comes to leading innovation.
p9
aa(lp10
VI'm an ethnographer.
p11
aVI use the methods of anthropology
p12
aVto understand the questions in which I'm interested.
p13
aVSo along with three co-conspirators,
p14
aVI spent nearly a decade observing up close and personal
p15
aVexceptional leaders of innovation.
p16
aVWe studied 16 men and women,
p17
aVlocated in seven countries across the globe,
p18
aVworking in 12 different industries.
p19
aVIn total, we spent hundreds of hours on the ground,
p20
aVon-site, watching these leaders in action.
p21
aVWe ended up with pages and pages and pages of field notes
p22
aVthat we analyzed and looked for patterns in what our leaders did.
p23
aVThe bottom line?
p24
aVIf we want to build organizations that can innovate time and again,
p25
aVwe must unlearn our conventional notions of leadership.
p26
aa(lp27
VLeading innovation is not about creating a vision,
p28
aVand inspiring others to execute it.
p29
aVBut what do we mean by innovation?
p30
aVAn innovation is anything that is both new and useful.
p31
aVIt can be a product or service.
p32
aVIt can be a process or a way of organizing.
p33
aVIt can be incremental, or it can be breakthrough.
p34
aVWe have a pretty inclusive definition.
p35
aa(lp36
VHow many of you recognize this man?
p37
aVPut your hands up.
p38
aVKeep your hands up, if you know who this is.
p39
aVHow about these familiar faces?
p40
aV(Laughter)
p41
aVFrom your show of hands,
p42
aVit looks like many of you have seen a Pixar movie,
p43
aVbut very few of you recognized Ed Catmull,
p44
aVthe founder and CEO of Pixar \u2014
p45
aVone of the companies I had the privilege of studying.
p46
aa(lp47
VMy first visit to Pixar was in 2005,
p48
aVwhen they were working on "Ratatouille,"
p49
aVthat provocative movie about a rat becoming a master chef.
p50
aVComputer-generated movies are really mainstream today,
p51
aVbut it took Ed and his colleagues nearly 20 years
p52
aVto create the first full-length C.G. movie.
p53
aVIn the 20 years hence, they've produced 14 movies.
p54
aVI was recently at Pixar, and I'm here to tell you
p55
aVthat number 15 is sure to be a winner.
p56
aa(lp57
VWhen many of us think about innovation, though,
p58
aVwe think about an Einstein having an 'Aha!' moment.
p59
aVBut we all know that's a myth.
p60
aVInnovation is not about solo genius,
p61
aVit's about collective genius.
p62
aVLet's think for a minute about what it takes to make a Pixar movie:
p63
aVNo solo genius, no flash of inspiration produces one of those movies.
p64
aVOn the contrary, it takes about 250 people four to five years,
p65
aVto make one of those movies.
p66
aa(lp67
VTo help us understand the process,
p68
aVan individual in the studio drew a version of this picture.
p69
aVHe did so reluctantly,
p70
aVbecause it suggested that the process  was a neat series of steps
p71
aVdone by discrete groups.
p72
aVEven with all those arrows, he thought it failed to really tell you
p73
aVjust how iterative, interrelated and, frankly, messy their process was.
p74
aa(lp75
VThroughout the making of a movie at Pixar, the story evolves.
p76
aVSo think about it.
p77
aVSome shots go through quickly.
p78
aVThey don't all go through in order.
p79
aVIt depends on how vexing the challenges are
p80
aVthat they come up with when they are working on a particular scene.
p81
aVSo if you think about that scene in "Up"
p82
aVwhere the boy hands the piece of chocolate to the bird,
p83
aVthat 10 seconds took one animator almost six months to perfect.
p84
aa(lp85
VThe other thing about a Pixar movie
p86
aVis that no part of the movie is considered finished
p87
aVuntil the entire movie wraps.
p88
aVPartway through one production, an animator drew a character
p89
aVwith an arched eyebrow that suggested a mischievous side.
p90
aVWhen the director saw that drawing, he thought it was great.
p91
aVIt was beautiful, but he said,
p92
aV"You've got to lose it; it doesn't fit the character."
p93
aVTwo weeks later, the director came back and said,
p94
aV"Let's put in those few seconds of film."
p95
aVBecause that animator was allowed to share
p96
aVwhat we referred to as his slice of genius,
p97
aVhe was able to help that director reconceive the character
p98
aVin a subtle but important way that really improved the story.
p99
aa(lp100
VWhat we know is, at the heart of innovation is a paradox.
p101
aVYou have to unleash the talents and passions of many people
p102
aVand you have to harness them into a work that is actually useful.
p103
aVInnovation is a journey.
p104
aVIt's a type of collaborative problem solving,
p105
aVusually among people who have different expertise
p106
aVand different points of view.
p107
aa(lp108
VInnovations rarely get created full-blown.
p109
aVAs many of you know,
p110
aVthey're the result, usually, of trial and error.
p111
aVLots of false starts, missteps and mistakes.
p112
aVInnovative work can be very exhilarating,
p113
aVbut it also can be really downright scary.
p114
aVSo when we look at why it is that Pixar is able to do what it does,
p115
aVwe have to ask ourselves, what's going on here?
p116
aa(lp117
VFor sure, history and certainly Hollywood,
p118
aVis full of star-studded teams that have failed.
p119
aVMost of those failures are attributed
p120
aVto too many stars or too many cooks, if you will, in the kitchen.
p121
aVSo why is it that Pixar, with all of its cooks,
p122
aVis able to be so successful time and time again?
p123
aVWhen we studied an Islamic Bank in Dubai,
p124
aVor a luxury brand in Korea, or a social enterprise in Africa,
p125
aVwe found that innovative organizations
p126
aVare communities that have three capabilities:
p127
aVcreative abrasion, creative agility and creative resolution.
p128
aVCreative abrasion is about being able to create a marketplace of ideas
p129
aVthrough debate and discourse.
p130
aVIn innovative organizations, they amplify differences,
p131
aVthey don't minimize them.
p132
aVCreative abrasion is not about brainstorming,
p133
aVwhere people suspend their judgment.
p134
aVNo, they know how to have very heated but constructive arguments
p135
aVto create a portfolio of alternatives.
p136
aa(lp137
VIndividuals in innovative organizations
p138
aVlearn how to inquire, they learn how to actively listen, but guess what?
p139
aVThey also learn how to advocate for their point of view.
p140
aVThey understand that innovation rarely happens
p141
aVunless you have both diversity and conflict.
p142
aVCreative agility is about being able to test and refine that portfolio of ideas
p143
aVthrough quick pursuit, reflection and adjustment.
p144
aVIt's about discovery-driven learning
p145
aVwhere you act, as opposed to plan, your way to the future.
p146
aVIt's about design thinking where you have that interesting combination
p147
aVof the scientific method and the artistic process.
p148
aVIt's about running a series of experiments, and not a series of pilots.
p149
aa(lp150
VExperiments are usually about learning.
p151
aVWhen you get a negative outcome,
p152
aVyou're still really learning something that you need to know.
p153
aVPilots are often about being right.
p154
aVWhen they don't work, someone or something is to blame.
p155
aVThe final capability is creative resolution.
p156
aVThis is about doing decision making
p157
aVin a way that you can actually combine even opposing ideas
p158
aVto reconfigure them in new combinations
p159
aVto produce a solution that is new and useful.
p160
aVWhen you look at innovative organizations, they never go along to get along.
p161
aVThey don't compromise.
p162
aVThey don't let one group or one individual dominate,
p163
aVeven if it's the boss, even if it's the expert.
p164
aVInstead, they have developed
p165
aVa rather patient and more inclusive decision making process
p166
aVthat allows for both/and solutions to arise
p167
aVand not simply either/or solutions.
p168
aVThese three capabilities are why we see
p169
aVthat Pixar is able to do what it does.
p170
aa(lp171
VLet me give you another example,
p172
aVand that example is the infrastructure group of Google.
p173
aVThe infrastructure group of Google is the group
p174
aVthat has to keep the website up and running 24/7.
p175
aVSo when Google was about to introduce Gmail and YouTube,
p176
aVthey knew that their data storage system wasn't adequate.
p177
aVThe head of the engineering group and the infrastructure group at that time
p178
aVwas a man named Bill Coughran.
p179
aVBill and his leadership team, who he referred to as his brain trust,
p180
aVhad to figure out what to do about this situation.
p181
aVThey thought about it for a while.
p182
aVInstead of creating a group to tackle this task,
p183
aVthey decided to allow groups to emerge spontaneously
p184
aVaround different alternatives.
p185
aa(lp186
VTwo groups coalesced.
p187
aVOne became known as Big Table,
p188
aVthe other became known as Build It From Scratch.
p189
aVBig Table proposed that they build on the current system.
p190
aVBuild It From Scratch proposed that it was time for a whole new system.
p191
aVSeparately, these two teams were allowed to work full-time
p192
aVon their particular approach.
p193
aVIn engineering reviews, Bill described his role as,
p194
aV"Injecting honesty into the process by driving debate."
p195
aa(lp196
VEarly on, the teams were encouraged to build prototypes so that they could
p197
aV"bump them up against reality and discover for themselves
p198
aVthe strengths and weaknesses of their particular approach."
p199
aVWhen Build It From Scratch shared their prototype with the group
p200
aVwhose beepers would have to go off in the middle of the night
p201
aVif something went wrong with the website,
p202
aVthey heard loud and clear about the limitations of their particular design.
p203
aVAs the need for a solution became more urgent
p204
aVand as the data, or the evidence, began to come in,
p205
aVit became pretty clear that the Big Table solution
p206
aVwas the right one for the moment.
p207
aVSo they selected that one.
p208
aa(lp209
VBut to make sure that they did not lose the learning
p210
aVof the Build it From Scratch team,
p211
aVBill asked two members of that team to join a new team that was emerging
p212
aVto work on the next-generation system.
p213
aVThis whole process took nearly two years,
p214
aVbut I was told that they were all working at breakneck speed.
p215
aa(lp216
VEarly in that process, one of the engineers had gone to Bill and said,
p217
aV"We're all too busy for this inefficient system
p218
aVof running parallel experiments."
p219
aVBut as the process unfolded, he began to understand
p220
aVthe wisdom of allowing talented people to play out their passions.
p221
aVHe admitted, "If you had forced us to all be on one team,
p222
aVwe might have focused on proving who was right, and winning,
p223
aVand not on learning and discovering what was the best answer for Google."
p224
aa(lp225
VWhy is it that Pixar and Google are able to innovate time and again?
p226
aVIt's because they've mastered the capabilities required for that.
p227
aVThey know how to do collaborative problem solving,
p228
aVthey know how to do discovery-driven learning
p229
aVand they know how to do integrated decision making.
p230
aa(lp231
VSome of you may be sitting there and saying to yourselves right now,
p232
aV"We don't know how to do those things in my organization.
p233
aVSo why do they know how to do those things at Pixar,
p234
aVand why do they know how to do those things at Google?"
p235
aVWhen many of the people that worked for Bill told us,
p236
aVin their opinion, that Bill was one of the finest leaders in Silicon Valley,
p237
aVwe completely agreed; the man is a genius.
p238
aa(lp239
VLeadership is the secret sauce.
p240
aVBut it's a different kind of leadership,
p241
aVnot the kind many of us think about when we think about great leadership.
p242
aVOne of the leaders I met with early on said to me,
p243
aV"Linda, I don't read books on leadership.
p244
aVAll they do is make me feel bad." (Laughter)
p245
aV"In the first chapter they say I'm supposed to create a vision.
p246
aVBut if I'm trying to do something that's truly new, I have no answers.
p247
aVI don't know what direction we're going in
p248
aVand I'm not even sure I know how to figure out how to get there."
p249
aVFor sure, there are times when visionary leadership
p250
aVis exactly what is needed.
p251
aa(lp252
VBut if we want to build organizations that can innovate time and again,
p253
aVwe must recast our understanding of what leadership is about.
p254
aVLeading innovation is about creating the space
p255
aVwhere people are willing and able to do the hard work
p256
aVof innovative problem solving.
p257
aa(lp258
VAt this point, some of you may be wondering,
p259
aV"What does that leadership really look like?"
p260
aVAt Pixar, they understand that innovation takes a village.
p261
aVThe leaders focus on building a sense of community
p262
aVand building those three capabilities.
p263
aVHow do they define leadership?
p264
aVThey say leadership is about creating a world
p265
aVto which people want to belong.
p266
aVWhat kind of world do people want to belong in at Pixar?
p267
aVA world where you're living at the frontier.
p268
aVWhat do they focus their time on?
p269
aVNot on creating a vision.
p270
aVInstead they spend their time thinking about,
p271
aV"How do we design a studio that has the sensibility of a public square
p272
aVso that people will interact?
p273
aVLet's put in a policy that anyone, no matter what their level or role,
p274
aVis allowed to give notes to the director
p275
aVabout how they feel about a particular film.
p276
aVWhat can we do to make sure
p277
aVthat all the disruptors, all the minority voices in this organization,
p278
aVspeak up and are heard?
p279
aVAnd, finally, let's bestow credit in a very generous way."
p280
aVI don't know if you've ever looked at the credits of a Pixar movie,
p281
aVbut the babies born during a production are listed there.
p282
aV(Laughter)
p283
aa(lp284
VHow did Bill think about what his role was?
p285
aVBill said, "I lead a volunteer organization.
p286
aVTalented people don't want to follow me anywhere.
p287
aVThey want to cocreate with me the future.
p288
aVMy job is to nurture the bottom-up
p289
aVand not let it degenerate into chaos."
p290
aVHow did he see his role?
p291
aV"I'm a role model, I'm a human glue,
p292
aVI'm a connector, I'm an aggregator of viewpoints.
p293
aVI'm never a dictator of viewpoints."
p294
aVAdvice about how you exercise the role?
p295
aVHire people who argue with you.
p296
aVAnd, guess what?
p297
aVSometimes it's best to be deliberately fuzzy and vague.
p298
aa(lp299
VSome of you may be wondering now,
p300
aVwhat are these people thinking?
p301
aVThey're thinking,
p302
aV"I'm not the visionary, I'm the social architect.
p303
aVI'm creating the space where people are willing and able
p304
aVto share and combine their talents and passions."
p305
aVIf some of you are worrying now that you don't work at a Pixar,
p306
aVor you don't work at a Google,
p307
aVI want to tell you there's still hope.
p308
aVWe've studied many organizations
p309
aVthat were really not organizations you'd think of
p310
aVas ones where a lot of innovation happens.
p311
aa(lp312
VWe studied a general counsel in a pharmaceutical company
p313
aVwho had to figure out how to get the outside lawyers,
p314
aV19 competitors, to collaborate and innovate.
p315
aVWe studied the head of marketing at a German automaker
p316
aVwhere, fundamentally, they believed that it was the design engineers,
p317
aVnot the marketeers, who were allowed to be innovative.
p318
aVWe also studied Vineet Nayar at HCL Technologies,
p319
aVan Indian outsourcing company.
p320
aVWhen we met Vineet,
p321
aVhis company was about, in his words, to become irrelevant.
p322
aVWe watched as he turned that company into a global dynamo of I.T. innovation.
p323
aVAt HCL technologies, like at many companies,
p324
aVthe leaders had learned to see their role as setting direction
p325
aVand making sure that no one deviated from it.
p326
aVWhat he did is tell them it was time for them
p327
aVto think about rethinking what they were supposed to do.
p328
aVBecause what was happening is that everybody was looking up
p329
aVand you weren't seeing the kind of bottom-up innovation
p330
aVwe saw at Pixar or Google.
p331
aVSo they began to work on that.
p332
aa(lp333
VThey stopped giving answers, they stopped trying to provide solutions.
p334
aVInstead, what they did is they began to see
p335
aVthe people at the bottom of the pyramid, the young sparks,
p336
aVthe people who were closest to the customers,
p337
aVas the source of innovation.
p338
aVThey began to transfer the organization's growth
p339
aVto that level.
p340
aVIn Vineet's language, this was about inverting the pyramid
p341
aVso that you could unleash the power of the many
p342
aVby loosening the stranglehold of the few,
p343
aVand increase the quality and the speed of innovation
p344
aVthat was happening every day.
p345
aa(lp346
VFor sure, Vineet and all the other leaders that we studied
p347
aVwere in fact visionaries.
p348
aVFor sure, they understood that that was not their role.
p349
aVSo I don't think it is accidental that many of you did not recognize Ed.
p350
aVBecause Ed, like Vineet, understands that our role as leaders
p351
aVis to set the stage, not perform on it.
p352
aVIf we want to invent a better future,
p353
aVand I suspect that's why many of us are here,
p354
aVthen we need to reimagine our task.
p355
aVOur task is to create the space
p356
aVwhere everybody's slices of genius
p357
aVcan be unleashed and harnessed,
p358
aVand turned into works of collective genius.
