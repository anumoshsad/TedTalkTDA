VI was born in Den Bosch,
p4
aVwhere the painter Hieronymus Bosch named himself after.
p5
aVAnd I've always been very fond of this painter
p6
aVwho lived and worked in the 15th century.
p7
aVAnd what is interesting about him in relation to morality
p8
aVis that he lived at a time where religion's influence was waning,
p9
aVand he was sort of wondering, I think,
p10
aVwhat would happen with society if there was no religion
p11
aVor if there was less religion.
p12
aVAnd so he painted this famous painting, "The Garden of Earthly Delights,"
p13
aVwhich some have interpreted as being humanity before the Fall,
p14
aVor being humanity without any Fall at all.
p15
aVAnd so it makes you wonder,
p16
aVwhat would happen if we hadn't tasted the fruit of knowledge, so to speak,
p17
aVand what kind of morality would we have.
p18
aa(lp19
VMuch later, as a student, I went to a very different garden,
p20
aVa zoological garden in Arnhem where we keep chimpanzees.
p21
aVThis is me at an early age with a baby chimpanzee.
p22
aa(lp23
V(Laughter)
p24
aa(lp25
VAnd I discovered there
p26
aVthat the chimpanzees are very power-hungry and wrote a book about it.
p27
aVAnd at that time the focus in a lot of animal research
p28
aVwas on aggression and competition.
p29
aVI painted a whole picture of the animal kingdom
p30
aVand humanity included, was that deep down we are competitors, we are aggressive,
p31
aVwe are all out for our own profit, basically.
p32
aVThis is the launch of my book.
p33
aVI'm not sure how well the chimpanzees read it,
p34
aVbut they surely seemed interested in the book.
p35
aa(lp36
V(Laughter)
p37
aa(lp38
VNow in the process of doing all this work
p39
aVon power and dominance and aggression and so on,
p40
aVI discovered that chimpanzees reconcile after fights.
p41
aVAnd so what you see here is two males who have had a fight.
p42
aVThey ended up in a tree, and one of them holds out a hand to the other.
p43
aVAnd about a second after I took the picture,
p44
aVthey came together in the fork of the tree
p45
aVand kissed and embraced each other.
p46
aa(lp47
VAnd this is very interesting
p48
aVbecause at the time, everything was about competition and aggression,
p49
aVso it wouldn't make any sense.
p50
aVThe only thing that matters is that you win or you lose.
p51
aVBut why reconcile after a fight? That doesn't make any sense.
p52
aVThis is the way bonobos do it. Bonobos do everything with sex.
p53
aVAnd so they also reconcile with sex.
p54
aVBut the principle is exactly the same.
p55
aVThe principle is that you have a valuable relationship
p56
aVthat is damaged by conflict, so you need to do something about it.
p57
aVSo my whole picture of the animal kingdom, and including humans also,
p58
aVstarted to change at that time.
p59
aa(lp60
VSo we have this image in political science, economics, the humanities,
p61
aVthe philosophy for that matter, that man is a wolf to man.
p62
aVAnd so deep down, our nature is actually nasty.
p63
aVI think it's a very unfair image for the wolf.
p64
aVThe wolf is, after all, a very cooperative animal.
p65
aVAnd that's why many of you have a dog at home,
p66
aVwhich has all these characteristics also.
p67
aVAnd it's really unfair to humanity,
p68
aVbecause humanity is actually much more cooperative and empathic
p69
aVthan given credit for.
p70
aVSo I started getting interested in those issues
p71
aVand studying that in other animals.
p72
aa(lp73
VSo these are the pillars of morality.
p74
aVIf you ask anyone, "What is morality based on?"
p75
aVthese are the two factors that always come out.
p76
aVOne is reciprocity,
p77
aVand associated with it is a sense of justice and a sense of fairness.
p78
aVAnd the other one is empathy and compassion.
p79
aVAnd human morality is more than this, but if you would remove these two pillars,
p80
aVthere would be not much remaining, I think.
p81
aVSo they're absolutely essential.
p82
aa(lp83
VSo let me give you a few examples here.
p84
aVThis is a very old video from the Yerkes Primate Center,
p85
aVwhere they trained chimpanzees to cooperate.
p86
aVSo this is already about a hundred years ago
p87
aVthat we were doing experiments on cooperation.
p88
aVWhat you have here is two young chimpanzees who have a box,
p89
aVand the box is too heavy for one chimp to pull in.
p90
aVAnd of course, there's food on the box.
p91
aVOtherwise they wouldn't be pulling so hard.
p92
aVAnd so they're bringing in the box.
p93
aVAnd you can see that they're synchronized.
p94
aVYou can see that they work together, they pull at the same moment.
p95
aVIt's already a big advance over many other animals
p96
aVwho wouldn't be able to do that.
p97
aVNow you're going to get a more interesting picture,
p98
aVbecause now one of the two chimps has been fed.
p99
aVSo one of the two is not really interested in the task anymore.
p100
aa(lp101
V(Laughter)
p102
aa(lp103
V(Laughter)
p104
aa(lp105
V(Laughter)
p106
aa(lp107
V[- and sometimes appears to convey its wishes and meanings by gestures.]
p108
aVNow look at what happens at the very end of this.
p109
aa(lp110
V(Laughter)
p111
aa(lp112
VHe takes basically everything.
p113
aa(lp114
V(Laughter)
p115
aa(lp116
VThere are two interesting parts about this.
p117
aVOne is that the chimp on the right
p118
aVhas a full understanding he needs the partner \u2014
p119
aVso a full understanding of the need for cooperation.
p120
aVThe second one is that the partner is willing to work
p121
aVeven though he's not interested in the food.
p122
aVWhy would that be?
p123
aVWell, that probably has to do with reciprocity.
p124
aVThere's actually a lot of evidence in primates and other animals
p125
aVthat they return favors.
p126
aVHe will get a return favor at some point in the future.
p127
aVAnd so that's how this all operates.
p128
aa(lp129
VWe do the same task with elephants.
p130
aVNow, it's very dangerous to work with elephants.
p131
aVAnother problem with elephants is that you cannot make an apparatus
p132
aVthat is too heavy for a single elephant.
p133
aVNow you can probably make it,
p134
aVbut it's going to be a pretty clumsy apparatus, I think.
p135
aVAnd so what we did in that case \u2014
p136
aVwe do these studies in Thailand for Josh Plotnik \u2014
p137
aVis we have an apparatus around which there is a rope, a single rope.
p138
aVAnd if you pull on this side of the rope, the rope disappears on the other side.
p139
aVSo two elephants need to pick it up at exactly the same time, and pull.
p140
aVOtherwise nothing is going to happen and the rope disappears.
p141
aa(lp142
VThe first tape you're going to see
p143
aVis two elephants who are released together arrive at the apparatus.
p144
aVThe apparatus is on the left, with food on it.
p145
aVAnd so they come together, they arrive together,
p146
aVthey pick it up together, and they pull together.
p147
aVSo it's actually fairly simple for them.
p148
aVThere they are.
p149
aVSo that's how they bring it in.
p150
aVBut now we're going to make it more difficult.
p151
aVBecause the purpose of this experiment
p152
aVis to see how well they understand cooperation.
p153
aVDo they understand that as well as the chimps, for example?
p154
aa(lp155
VWhat we do in the next step is we release one elephant before the other
p156
aVand that elephant needs to be smart enough
p157
aVto stay there and wait and not pull at the rope \u2014
p158
aVbecause if he pulls at the rope, it disappears and the whole test is over.
p159
aVNow this elephant does something illegal that we did not teach it.
p160
aVBut it shows the understanding he has,
p161
aVbecause he puts his big foot on the rope,
p162
aVstands on the rope and waits there for the other,
p163
aVand then the other is going to do all the work for him.
p164
aVSo it's what we call freeloading.
p165
aa(lp166
V(Laughter)
p167
aa(lp168
VBut it shows the intelligence that the elephants have.
p169
aVThey developed several of these alternative techniques
p170
aVthat we did not approve of, necessarily.
p171
aa(lp172
V(Laughter)
p173
aa(lp174
VSo the other elephant is now coming ...
p175
aVand is going to pull it in.
p176
aVNow look at the other; it doesn't forget to eat, of course.
p177
aa(lp178
V(Laughter)
p179
aa(lp180
VThis was the cooperation and reciprocity part.
p181
aa(lp182
VNow something on empathy.
p183
aVEmpathy is my main topic at the moment, of research.
p184
aVAnd empathy has two qualities:
p185
aVOne is the understanding part of it.
p186
aVThis is just a regular definition:
p187
aVthe ability to understand and share the feelings of another.
p188
aVAnd the emotional part.
p189
aVEmpathy has basically two channels: One is the body channel,
p190
aVIf you talk with a sad person,
p191
aVyou're going to adopt a sad expression and a sad posture,
p192
aVand before you know it, you feel sad.
p193
aVAnd that's sort of the body channel of emotional empathy,
p194
aVwhich many animals have.
p195
aVYour average dog has that also.
p196
aVThat's why people keep mammals in the home
p197
aVand not turtles or snakes or something like that,
p198
aVwho don't have that kind of empathy.
p199
aVAnd then there's a cognitive channel,
p200
aVwhich is more that you can take the perspective of somebody else.
p201
aVAnd that's more limited.
p202
aVVery few animals, I think elephants and apes, can do that kind of thing.
p203
aa(lp204
VSo synchronization,
p205
aVwhich is part of that whole empathy mechanism,
p206
aVis a very old one in the animal kingdom.
p207
aVIn humans, of course, we can study that with yawn contagion.
p208
aVHumans yawn when others yawn.
p209
aVAnd it's related to empathy.
p210
aVIt activates the same areas in the brain.
p211
aVAlso, we know that people who have a lot of yawn contagion
p212
aVare highly empathic.
p213
aVPeople who have problems with empathy, such as autistic children,
p214
aVthey don't have yawn contagion.
p215
aVSo it is connected.
p216
aa(lp217
VAnd we study that in our chimpanzees by presenting them with an animated head.
p218
aVSo that's what you see on the upper-left, an animated head that yawns.
p219
aVAnd there's a chimpanzee watching,
p220
aVan actual real chimpanzee watching a computer screen
p221
aVon which we play these animations.
p222
aa(lp223
V(Laughter)
p224
aa(lp225
VSo yawn contagion that you're probably all familiar with \u2014
p226
aVand maybe you're going to start yawning soon now \u2014
p227
aVis something that we share with other animals.
p228
aVAnd that's related to that whole body channel of synchronization
p229
aVthat underlies empathy,
p230
aVand that is universal in the mammals, basically.
p231
aa(lp232
VWe also study more complex expressions \u2014 This is consolation.
p233
aVThis is a male chimpanzee who has lost a fight and he's screaming,
p234
aVand a juvenile comes over and puts an arm around him
p235
aVand calms him down.
p236
aVThat's consolation.
p237
aVIt's very similar to human consolation.
p238
aVAnd consolation behavior \u2014
p239
aa(lp240
V(Laughter)
p241
aa(lp242
Vit's empathy driven.
p243
aVActually, the way to study empathy in human children
p244
aVis to instruct a family member to act distressed,
p245
aVand then to see what young children do.
p246
aVAnd so it is related to empathy,
p247
aVand that's the kind of expressions we look at.
p248
aa(lp249
VWe also recently published an experiment you may have heard about.
p250
aVIt's on altruism and chimpanzees,
p251
aVwhere the question is: Do chimpanzees care about the welfare of somebody else?
p252
aVAnd for decades it had been assumed that only humans can do that,
p253
aVthat only humans worry about the welfare of somebody else.
p254
aVNow we did a very simple experiment.
p255
aVWe do that on chimpanzees that live in Lawrenceville,
p256
aVin the field station of Yerkes.
p257
aVAnd so that's how they live.
p258
aVAnd we call them into a room and do experiments with them.
p259
aVIn this case, we put two chimpanzees side-by-side,
p260
aVand one has a bucket full of tokens, and the tokens have different meanings.
p261
aVOne kind of token feeds only the partner who chooses,
p262
aVthe other one feeds both of them.
p263
aa(lp264
VSo this is a study we did with Vicki Horner.
p265
aVAnd here, you have the two color tokens.
p266
aVSo they have a whole bucket full of them.
p267
aVAnd they have to pick one of the two colors.
p268
aVYou will see how that goes.
p269
aVSo if this chimp makes the selfish choice,
p270
aVwhich is the red token in this case,
p271
aVhe needs to give it to us,
p272
aVwe pick it up, we put it on a table where there's two food rewards,
p273
aVbut in this case, only the one on the right gets food.
p274
aVThe one on the left walks away because she knows already
p275
aVthat this is not a good test for her.
p276
aVThen the next one is the pro-social token.
p277
aa(lp278
VSo the one who makes the choices \u2014 that's the interesting part here \u2014
p279
aVfor the one who makes the choices, it doesn't really matter.
p280
aVSo she gives us now a pro-social token and both chimps get fed.
p281
aVSo the one who makes the choices always gets a reward.
p282
aVSo it doesn't matter whatsoever.
p283
aVAnd she should actually be choosing blindly.
p284
aVBut what we find is that they prefer the pro-social token.
p285
aVSo this is the 50 percent line, that's the random expectation.
p286
aVAnd especially if the partner draws attention to itself, they choose more.
p287
aa(lp288
VAnd if the partner puts pressure on them \u2014
p289
aVso if the partner starts spitting water and intimidating them \u2014
p290
aVthen the choices go down.
p291
aa(lp292
V(Laughter)
p293
aa(lp294
VIt's as if they're saying,
p295
aV"If you're not behaving, I'm not going to be pro-social today."
p296
aVAnd this is what happens without a partner,
p297
aVwhen there's no partner sitting there.
p298
aVSo we found that the chimpanzees do care about the well-being of somebody else \u2014
p299
aVespecially, these are other members of their own group.
p300
aa(lp301
VSo the final experiment that I want to mention to you
p302
aVis our fairness study.
p303
aVAnd so this became a very famous study.
p304
aVAnd there are now many more,
p305
aVbecause after we did this about 10 years ago,
p306
aVit became very well-known.
p307
aVAnd we did that originally with Capuchin monkeys.
p308
aVAnd I'm going to show you the first experiment that we did.
p309
aVIt has now been done with dogs and with birds
p310
aVand with chimpanzees.
p311
aVBut with Sarah Brosnan, we started out with Capuchin monkeys.
p312
aa(lp313
VSo what we did is we put two Capuchin monkeys side-by-side.
p314
aVAgain, these animals, live in a group, they know each other.
p315
aVWe take them out of the group, put them in a test chamber.
p316
aVAnd there's a very simple task that they need to do.
p317
aVAnd if you give both of them cucumber for the task,
p318
aVthe two monkeys side-by-side,
p319
aVthey're perfectly willing to do this 25 times in a row.
p320
aVSo cucumber, even though it's only really water in my opinion,
p321
aVbut cucumber is perfectly fine for them.
p322
aVNow if you give the partner grapes \u2014
p323
aVthe food preferences of my Capuchin monkeys
p324
aVcorrespond exactly with the prices in the supermarket \u2014
p325
aVand so if you give them grapes \u2014 it's a far better food \u2014
p326
aVthen you create inequity between them.
p327
aVSo that's the experiment we did.
p328
aa(lp329
VRecently, we videotaped it with new monkeys
p330
aVwho'd never done the task,
p331
aVthinking that maybe they would have a stronger reaction,
p332
aVand that turned out to be right.
p333
aVThe one on the left is the monkey who gets cucumber.
p334
aVThe one on the right is the one who gets grapes.
p335
aVThe one who gets cucumber \u2014
p336
aVnote that the first piece of cucumber is perfectly fine.
p337
aVThe first piece she eats.
p338
aVThen she sees the other one getting grape, and you will see what happens.
p339
aVSo she gives a rock to us. That's the task.
p340
aVAnd we give her a piece of cucumber and she eats it.
p341
aVThe other one needs to give a rock to us.
p342
aVAnd that's what she does.
p343
aVAnd she gets a grape ...
p344
aVand eats it.
p345
aVThe other one sees that.
p346
aVShe gives a rock to us now,
p347
aVgets, again, cucumber.
p348
aa(lp349
V(Laughter)
p350
aa(lp351
V(Laughter ends)
p352
aa(lp353
VShe tests a rock now against the wall.
p354
aVShe needs to give it to us.
p355
aVAnd she gets cucumber again.
p356
aa(lp357
V(Laughter)
p358
aa(lp359
VSo this is basically the Wall Street protest that you see here.
p360
aa(lp361
V(Laughter)
p362
aa(lp363
V(Applause)
p364
aa(lp365
VI still have two minutes left \u2014
p366
aVlet me tell you a funny story about this.
p367
aVThis study became very famous and we got a lot of comments,
p368
aVespecially anthropologists, economists, philosophers.
p369
aVThey didn't like this at all.
p370
aVBecause they had decided in their minds, I believe,
p371
aVthat fairness is a very complex issue, and that animals cannot have it.
p372
aVAnd so one philosopher even wrote us
p373
aVthat it was impossible that monkeys had a sense of fairness
p374
aVbecause fairness was invented during the French Revolution.
p375
aa(lp376
V(Laughter)
p377
aa(lp378
VAnd another one wrote a whole chapter
p379
aVsaying that he would believe it had something to do with fairness,
p380
aVif the one who got grapes would refuse the grapes.
p381
aVNow the funny thing is that Sarah Brosnan, who's been doing this with chimpanzees,
p382
aVhad a couple of combinations of chimpanzees
p383
aVwhere, indeed, the one who would get the grape
p384
aVwould refuse the grape until the other guy also got a grape.
p385
aVSo we're getting very close to the human sense of fairness.
p386
aVAnd I think philosophers need to rethink their philosophy for a while.
p387
aa(lp388
VSo let me summarize.
p389
aVI believe there's an evolved morality.
p390
aVI think morality is much more than what I've been talking about,
p391
aVbut it would be impossible without these ingredients
p392
aVthat we find in other primates,
p393
aVwhich are empathy and consolation,
p394
aVpro-social tendencies and reciprocity and a sense of fairness.
p395
aVAnd so we work on these particular issues
p396
aVto see if we can create a morality from the bottom up, so to speak,
p397
aVwithout necessarily god and religion involved,
p398
aVand to see how we can get to an evolved morality.
p399
