VMy story begins right here actually in Rajasthan
p4
aVabout two years ago.
p5
aVI was in the desert, under the starry skies
p6
aVwith the Sufi singer Mukhtiar Ali.
p7
aVAnd we were in conversation
p8
aVabout how nothing had changed
p9
aVsince the time of the ancient Indian epic "The Mahabharata."
p10
aa(lp11
VSo back in the day, when us Indians wanted to travel
p12
aVwe'd jump into a chariot and we'd zoom across the sky.
p13
aVNow we do the same with airplanes.
p14
aVBack then,
p15
aVwhen Arjuna, the great Indian warrior prince,
p16
aVwhen he was thirsty, he'd take out a bow,
p17
aVhe'd shoot it into the ground and water would come out.
p18
aVNow we do the same
p19
aVwith drills and machines.
p20
aa(lp21
VThe conclusion that we came to
p22
aVwas that magic had been replaced
p23
aVby machinery.
p24
aVAnd this made me really sad.
p25
aVI found myself becoming a little bit of a technophobe.
p26
aVI was terrified by this idea
p27
aVthat I would lose the ability
p28
aVto enjoy and appreciate the sunset
p29
aVwithout having my camera on me, without tweeting it to my friends.
p30
aVAnd it felt like technology
p31
aVshould enable magic, not kill it.
p32
aa(lp33
VWhen I was a little girl,
p34
aVmy grandfather gave me his little silver pocket watch.
p35
aVAnd this piece of 50-year-old technology
p36
aVbecame the most magical thing to me.
p37
aVIt became a gilded gateway
p38
aVinto a world full of pirates and shipwrecks
p39
aVand images in my imagination.
p40
aVSo I felt like our cellphones
p41
aVand our fancy watches and our cameras
p42
aVhad stopped us from dreaming.
p43
aVThey stopped us from being inspired.
p44
aVAnd so I jumped in, I jumped into this world of technology,
p45
aVto see how I could use it to enable magic
p46
aVas opposed to kill it.
p47
aa(lp48
VI've been illustrating books since I was 16.
p49
aVAnd so when I saw the iPad,
p50
aVI saw it as a storytelling device
p51
aVthat could connect readers all over the world.
p52
aVIt can know how we're holding it.
p53
aVIt can know where we are.
p54
aVIt brings together image and text
p55
aVand animation and sound and touch.
p56
aVStorytelling is becoming
p57
aVmore and more multi-sensorial.
p58
aVBut what are we doing with it?
p59
aa(lp60
VSo I'm actually just going to go in and launch Khoya,
p61
aVan interactive app for the iPad.
p62
aVSo it says, "Place your fingers
p63
aVupon each light."
p64
aVAnd so \u2014
p65
aV(Music)
p66
aVIt says, "This box belongs to ... "
p67
aVAnd so I type in my name.
p68
aVAnd actually I become a character in the book.
p69
aVAt various points, a little letter drops down to me \u2014
p70
aVand the iPad knows where you live because of GPS \u2014
p71
aVwhich is actually addressed to me.
p72
aVThe child in me is really excited
p73
aVby these kinds of possibilities.
p74
aa(lp75
VNow I've been talking a lot about magic.
p76
aVAnd I don't mean wizards and dragons,
p77
aVI mean the kind of childhood magic,
p78
aVthose ideas that we all harbored as children.
p79
aVThis idea of fireflies in a jar, for some reason,
p80
aVwas always really exciting to me.
p81
aVAnd so over here you need to tilt your iPad,
p82
aVtake the fireflies out.
p83
aVAnd they actually illuminate your way through the rest of the book.
p84
aa(lp85
VAnother idea that really fascinated me as a child
p86
aVwas that an entire galaxy could be contained
p87
aVwithin a single marble.
p88
aVAnd so over here,
p89
aVeach book and each world
p90
aVbecomes a little marble
p91
aVthat I drag in
p92
aVto this magical device within the device.
p93
aVAnd it opens up a map.
p94
aVAll along, all fantasy books have always had maps,
p95
aVbut these maps have been static.
p96
aVThis is a map that grows and glows
p97
aVand becomes your navigation for the rest of the book.
p98
aVIt reveals itself to you at certain points in the book as well.
p99
aVSo I'm just going to enter in.
p100
aa(lp101
VAnother thing that's actually really important to me
p102
aVis creating content that is Indian
p103
aVand yet very contemporary.
p104
aVOver here, these are the Apsaras.
p105
aVSo we've all heard about fairies and we've all heard about nymphs,
p106
aVbut how many people outside of India
p107
aVknow about their Indian counterparts, the Apsaras?
p108
aVThese poor Apsaras have been trapped inside Indra's chambers for thousands of years
p109
aVin an old and musty book.
p110
aVAnd so we're bringing them back
p111
aVin a contemporary story for children.
p112
aVAnd a story that actually deals with new issues
p113
aVlike the environmental crisis.
p114
aV(Music)
p115
aa(lp116
VSpeaking of the environmental crisis,
p117
aVI think a big problem has been in the last 10 years
p118
aVis that children have been locked inside their rooms,
p119
aVglued to their PCs, they haven't been able to get out.
p120
aVBut now with mobile technology,
p121
aVwe can actually take our children outside into the natural world
p122
aVwith their technology.
p123
aVOne of the interactions in the book
p124
aVis that you're sent off on this quest
p125
aVwhere you need to go outside,
p126
aVtake out your camera on the iPad
p127
aVand collect pictures of different natural objects.
p128
aa(lp129
VWhen I was a child, I had multiple collections
p130
aVof sticks and stones and pebbles and shells.
p131
aVAnd somehow kids don't do that anymore.
p132
aVSo in bringing back this childhood ritual,
p133
aVyou need to go out
p134
aVand, in one chapter, take a picture of a flower
p135
aVand then tag it.
p136
aVIn another chapter, you need to take a picture of a piece of bark
p137
aVand then tag that.
p138
aVAnd what happens
p139
aVis that you actually create a digital collection of photographs
p140
aVthat you can then put up online.
p141
aVA child in London puts up a picture of a fox
p142
aVand says, "Oh, I saw a fox today."
p143
aVA child in India says, "I saw a monkey today."
p144
aVAnd it creates this kind of social network
p145
aVaround a collection of digital photographs
p146
aVthat you've actually taken.
p147
aa(lp148
VIn the possibilities of linking together
p149
aVmagic, the earth and technology,
p150
aVthere are multiple possibilities.
p151
aVIn the next book, we plan on having an interaction
p152
aVwhere you take your iPad out with the video on
p153
aVand through augmented reality,
p154
aVyou see this layer of animated pixies
p155
aVappear on a houseplant that's outside your house.
p156
aVAt one point, your screen is filled up with leaves.
p157
aVAnd so you need to make the sound of wind and blow them away
p158
aVand read the rest of the book.
p159
aa(lp160
VWe're moving, we're all moving here,
p161
aVto a world where the forces of nature
p162
aVcome closer together to technology,
p163
aVand magic and technology can come closer together.
p164
aVWe're harnessing energy from the sun.
p165
aVWe're bringing our children and ourselves
p166
aVcloser to the natural world
p167
aVand that magic and joy
p168
aVand childhood love that we had
p169
aVthrough the simple medium of a story.
p170

VThank you.
