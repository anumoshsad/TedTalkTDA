VI grew up on a small farm in Missouri.
p4
aVWe lived on less than a dollar a day
p5
aVfor about 15 years.
p6
aVI got a scholarship, went to university,
p7
aVstudied international agriculture, studied anthropology,
p8
aVand decided I was going to give back.
p9
aVI was going to work with small farmers.
p10
aVI was going to help alleviate poverty.
p11
aVI was going to work on international development,
p12
aVand then I took a turn
p13
aVand ended up here.
p14
aVNow, if you get a Ph.D., and you decide not to teach,
p15
aVyou don't always end up in a place like this.
p16
aVIt's a choice. You might end up driving a taxicab.
p17
aVYou could be in New York.
p18
aVWhat I found was,
p19
aVI started working with refugees and famine victims \u2014
p20
aVsmall farmers, all, or nearly all \u2014
p21
aVwho had been dispossessed and displaced.
p22
aVNow, what I'd been trained to do
p23
aVwas methodological research on such people.
p24
aVSo I did it: I found out how many women
p25
aVhad been raped en route to these camps.
p26
aVI found out how many people had been put in jail,
p27
aVhow many family members had been killed.
p28
aVI assessed how long they were going to stay
p29
aVand how much it would take to feed them.
p30
aVAnd I got really good at predicting
p31
aVhow many body bags you would need
p32
aVfor the people who were going to die in these camps.
p33
aa(lp34
VNow this is God's work, but it's not my work.
p35
aVIt's not the work I set out to do.
p36
aVSo I was at a Grateful Dead benefit concert on the rainforests
p37
aVin 1988.
p38
aVI met a guy \u2014 the guy on the left.
p39
aVHis name was Ben.
p40
aVHe said, "What can I do to save the rainforests?"
p41
aVI said, "Well, Ben, what do you do?"
p42
aV"I make ice cream."
p43
aVSo I said, "Well, you've got to make
p44
aVa rainforest ice cream.
p45
aVAnd you've got to use nuts from the rainforests
p46
aVto show that forests are worth more as forests
p47
aVthan they are as pasture."
p48
aVHe said, "Okay."
p49
aVWithin a year,
p50
aVRainforest Crunch was on the shelves.
p51
aVIt was a great success.
p52
aVWe did our first million-dollars-worth of trade
p53
aVby buying on 30 days and selling on 21.
p54
aVThat gets your adrenaline going.
p55
aVThen we had a four and a half million-dollar line of credit
p56
aVbecause we were credit-worthy at that point.
p57
aVWe had 15 to 20, maybe 22 percent
p58
aVof the global Brazil-nut market.
p59
aVWe paid two to three times more than anybody else.
p60
aVEverybody else raised their prices to the gatherers of Brazil nuts
p61
aVbecause we would buy it otherwise.
p62
aVA great success.
p63
aV50 companies signed up, 200 products came out,
p64
aVgenerated 100 million in sales.
p65
aVIt failed.
p66
aVWhy did it fail?
p67
aVBecause the people who were gathering Brazil nuts
p68
aVweren't the same people who were cutting the forests.
p69
aVAnd the people who made money from Brazil nuts
p70
aVwere not the people who made money from cutting the forests.
p71
aVWe were attacking the wrong driver.
p72
aVWe needed to be working on beef.
p73
aVWe needed to be working on lumber.
p74
aVWe needed to be working on soy \u2014
p75
aVthings that we were not focused on.
p76
aa(lp77
VSo let's go back to Sudan.
p78
aVI often talk to refugees:
p79
aV"Why was it that the West didn't realize
p80
aVthat famines are caused by policies and politics,
p81
aVnot by weather?"
p82
aVAnd this farmer said to me, one day,
p83
aVsomething that was very profound.
p84
aVHe said, "You can't wake a person who's pretending to sleep."
p85
aa(lp86
V(Laughter)
p87
aa(lp88
VOkay. Fast forward.
p89
aVWe live on a planet.
p90
aVThere's just one of them.
p91
aVWe've got to wake up to the fact
p92
aVthat we don't have any more
p93
aVand that this is a finite planet.
p94
aVWe know the limits of the resources we have.
p95
aVWe may be able to use them differently.
p96
aVWe may have some innovative, new ideas.
p97
aVBut in general, this is what we've got.
p98
aVThere's no more of it.
p99
aVThere's a basic equation that we can't get away from.
p100
aVPopulation times consumption
p101
aVhas got to have some kind of relationship to the planet,
p102
aVand right now, it's a simple "not equal."
p103
aVOur work shows that we're living
p104
aVat about 1.3 planets.
p105
aVSince 1990,
p106
aVwe crossed the line
p107
aVof being in a sustainable relationship to the planet.
p108
aVNow we're at 1.3.
p109
aVIf we were farmers, we'd be eating our seed.
p110
aVFor bankers, we'd be living off the principal, not the interest.
p111
aVThis is where we stand today.
p112
aVA lot of people like to point
p113
aVto some place else as the cause of the problem.
p114
aVIt's always population growth.
p115
aVPopulation growth's important,
p116
aVbut it's also about how much each person consumes.
p117
aVSo when the average American
p118
aVconsumes 43 times as much
p119
aVas the average African,
p120
aVwe've got to think that consumption is an issue.
p121
aVIt's not just about population,
p122
aVand it's not just about them; it's about us.
p123
aVBut it's not just about people;
p124
aVit's about lifestyles.
p125
aVThere's very good evidence \u2014
p126
aVagain, we don't necessarily have
p127
aVa peer-reviewed methodology
p128
aVthat's bulletproof yet \u2014
p129
aVbut there's very good evidence
p130
aVthat the average cat in Europe
p131
aVhas a larger environmental footprint in its lifetime
p132
aVthan the average African.
p133
aVYou think that's not an issue going forward?
p134
aVYou think that's not a question
p135
aVas to how we should be using the Earth's resources?
p136
aa(lp137
VLet's go back and visit our equation.
p138
aVIn 2000, we had six billion people on the planet.
p139
aVThey were consuming what they were consuming \u2014
p140
aVlet's say one unit of consumption each.
p141
aVWe have six billion units of consumption.
p142
aVBy 2050,
p143
aVwe're going to have nine billion people \u2014 all the scientists agree.
p144
aVThey're all going to consume twice as much as they currently do \u2014
p145
aVscientists, again, agree \u2014
p146
aVbecause income is going to grow in developing countries
p147
aVfive times what it is today \u2014
p148
aVon global average, about [2.9].
p149
aVSo we're going to have 18 billion units of consumption.
p150
aVWho have you heard talking lately
p151
aVthat's said we have to triple production
p152
aVof goods and services?
p153
aVBut that's what the math says.
p154
aVWe're not going to be able to do that.
p155
aVWe can get productivity up.
p156
aVWe can get efficiency up.
p157
aVBut we've also got to get consumption down.
p158
aVWe need to use less
p159
aVto make more.
p160
aVAnd then we need to use less again.
p161
aVAnd then we need to consume less.
p162
aVAll of those things are part of that equation.
p163
aa(lp164
VBut it basically raises a fundamental question:
p165
aVshould consumers have a choice
p166
aVabout sustainability, about sustainable products?
p167
aVShould you be able to buy a product that's sustainable
p168
aVsitting next to one that isn't,
p169
aVor should all the products on the shelf be sustainable?
p170
aVIf they should all be sustainable on a finite planet,
p171
aVhow do you make that happen?
p172
aVThe average consumer takes 1.8 seconds in the U.S.
p173
aVOkay, so let's be generous.
p174
aVLet's say it's 3.5 seconds in Europe.
p175
aVHow do you evaluate all the scientific data
p176
aVaround a product,
p177
aVthe data that's changing on a weekly, if not a daily, basis?
p178
aVHow do you get informed?
p179
aVYou don't.
p180
aVHere's a little question.
p181
aVFrom a greenhouse gas perspective,
p182
aVis lamb produced in the U.K.
p183
aVbetter than lamb produced in New Zealand,
p184
aVfrozen and shipped to the U.K.?
p185
aVIs a bad feeder lot operation for beef
p186
aVbetter or worse than
p187
aVa bad grazing operation for beef?
p188
aVDo organic potatoes
p189
aVactually have fewer toxic chemicals
p190
aVused to produce them
p191
aVthan conventional potatoes?
p192
aVIn every single case,
p193
aVthe answer is "it depends."
p194
aVIt depends on who produced it and how,
p195
aVin every single instance.
p196
aVAnd there are many others.
p197
aVHow is a consumer going to walk through this minefield?
p198
aVThey're not.
p199
aVThey may have a lot of opinions about it,
p200
aVbut they're not going to be terribly informed.
p201
aa(lp202
VSustainability has got to be a pre-competitive issue.
p203
aVIt's got to be something we all care about.
p204
aVAnd we need collusion.
p205
aVWe need groups to work together that never have.
p206
aVWe need Cargill to work with Bunge.
p207
aVWe need Coke to work with Pepsi.
p208
aVWe need Oxford to work with Cambridge.
p209
aVWe need Greenpeace to work with WWF.
p210
aVEverybody's got to work together \u2014
p211
aVChina and the U.S.
p212
aVWe need to begin to manage this planet
p213
aVas if our life depended on it,
p214
aVbecause it does,
p215
aVit fundamentally does.
p216
aVBut we can't do everything.
p217
aVEven if we get everybody working on it,
p218
aVwe've got to be strategic.
p219
aVWe need to focus on the where,
p220
aVthe what and the who.
p221
aVSo, the where:
p222
aVWe've identified 35 places globally that we need to work.
p223
aVThese are the places that are the richest in biodiversity
p224
aVand the most important from an ecosystem function point-of-view.
p225
aVWe have to work in these places.
p226
aVWe have to save these places if we want a chance in hell
p227
aVof preserving biodiversity as we know it.
p228
aVWe looked at the threats to these places.
p229
aVThese are the 15 commodities
p230
aVthat fundamentally pose the biggest threats
p231
aVto these places
p232
aVbecause of deforestation,
p233
aVsoil loss, water use, pesticide use,
p234
aVover-fishing, etc.
p235
aa(lp236
VSo we've got 35 places,
p237
aVwe've got 15 priority commodities,
p238
aVwho do we work with
p239
aVto change the way those commodities are produced?
p240
aVAre we going to work with 6.9 billion consumers?
p241
aVLet's see, that's about 7,000 languages,
p242
aV350 major languages \u2014
p243
aVa lot of work there.
p244
aVI don't see anybody actually being able
p245
aVto do that very effectively.
p246
aVAre we going to work with 1.5 billion producers?
p247
aVAgain, a daunting task.
p248
aVThere must be a better way.
p249
aV300 to 500 companies
p250
aVcontrol 70 percent or more
p251
aVof the trade of each of the 15 commodities
p252
aVthat we've identified as the most significant.
p253
aVIf we work with those, if we change those companies
p254
aVand the way they do business,
p255
aVthen the rest will happen automatically.
p256
aVSo, we went through our 15 commodities.
p257
aVThis is nine of them.
p258
aVWe lined them up side-by-side,
p259
aVand we put the names of the companies that work
p260
aVon each of those.
p261
aVAnd if you go through the first 25 or 30 names
p262
aVof each of the commodities,
p263
aVwhat you begin to see is,
p264
aVgosh, there's Cargill here, there's Cargill there,
p265
aVthere's Cargill everywhere.
p266
aVIn fact, these names start coming up over and over again.
p267
aVSo we did the analysis again a slightly different way.
p268
aVWe said: if we take the top hundred companies,
p269
aVwhat percentage
p270
aVof all 15 commodities
p271
aVdo they touch, buy or sell?
p272
aVAnd what we found is it's 25 percent.
p273
aVSo 100 companies
p274
aVcontrol 25 percent of the trade
p275
aVof all 15 of the most significant
p276
aVcommodities on the planet.
p277
aVWe can get our arms around a hundred companies.
p278
aVA hundred companies, we can work with.
p279
aa(lp280
VWhy is 25 percent important?
p281
aVBecause if these companies demand sustainable products,
p282
aVthey'll pull 40 to 50 percent of production.
p283
aVCompanies can push producers
p284
aVfaster than consumers can.
p285
aVBy companies asking for this,
p286
aVwe can leverage production so much faster
p287
aVthan by waiting for consumers to do it.
p288
aVAfter 40 years, the global organic movement
p289
aVhas achieved 0.7 of one percent
p290
aVof global food.
p291
aVWe can't wait that long.
p292
aVWe don't have that kind of time.
p293
aVWe need change
p294
aVthat's going to accelerate.
p295
aVEven working with individual companies
p296
aVis not probably going to get us there.
p297
aVWe need to begin to work with industries.
p298
aVSo we've started roundtables
p299
aVwhere we bring together the entire value chain,
p300
aVfrom producers
p301
aVall the way to the retailers and brands.
p302
aVWe bring in civil society, we bring in NGOs,
p303
aVwe bring in researchers and scientists
p304
aVto have an informed discussion \u2014
p305
aVsometimes a battle royale \u2014
p306
aVto figure out what are the key impacts
p307
aVof these products,
p308
aVwhat is a global benchmark,
p309
aVwhat's an acceptable impact,
p310
aVand design standards around that.
p311
aVIt's not all fun and games.
p312
aa(lp313
VIn salmon aquaculture,
p314
aVwe kicked off a roundtable
p315
aValmost six years ago.
p316
aVEight entities came to the table.
p317
aVWe eventually got, I think, 60 percent
p318
aVof global production at the table
p319
aVand 25 percent of demand at the table.
p320
aVThree of the original eight entities were suing each other.
p321
aVAnd yet, next week, we launch
p322
aVglobally verified, vetted and certified
p323
aVstandards for salmon aquaculture.
p324
aVIt can happen.
p325
aa(lp326
V(Applause)
p327
aa(lp328
VSo what brings
p329
aVthe different entities to the table?
p330
aVIt's risk and demand.
p331
aVFor the big companies, it's reputational risk,
p332
aVbut more importantly,
p333
aVthey don't care what the price of commodities is.
p334
aVIf they don't have commodities, they don't have a business.
p335
aVThey care about availability,
p336
aVso the big risk for them is not having product at all.
p337
aVFor the producers,
p338
aVif a buyer wants to buy something produced a certain way,
p339
aVthat's what brings them to the table.
p340
aVSo it's the demand that brings them to the table.
p341
aVThe good news is
p342
aVwe identified a hundred companies two years ago.
p343
aVIn the last 18 months, we've signed agreements
p344
aVwith 40 of those hundred companies
p345
aVto begin to work with them on their supply chain.
p346
aVAnd in the next 18 months,
p347
aVwe will have signed up to work with another 40,
p348
aVand we think we'll get those signed as well.
p349
aVNow what we're doing is bringing the CEOs
p350
aVof these 80 companies together
p351
aVto help twist the arms of the final 20,
p352
aVto bring them to the table,
p353
aVbecause they don't like NGOs, they've never worked with NGOs,
p354
aVthey're concerned about this, they're concerned about that,
p355
aVbut we all need to be in this together.
p356
aVSo we're pulling out all the stops.
p357
aVWe're using whatever leverage we have to bring them to the table.
p358
aa(lp359
VOne company we're working with that's begun \u2014
p360
aVin baby steps, perhaps \u2014
p361
aVbut has begun this journey on sustainability is Cargill.
p362
aVThey've funded research that shows
p363
aVthat we can double global palm oil production
p364
aVwithout cutting a single tree in the next 20 years,
p365
aVand do it all in Borneo alone
p366
aVby planting on land that's already degraded.
p367
aVThe study shows that the highest net present value
p368
aVfor palm oil
p369
aVis on land that's been degraded.
p370
aVThey're also undertaking a study to look at
p371
aVall of their supplies of palm oil
p372
aVto see if they could be certified
p373
aVand what they would need to change in order to become third-party certified
p374
aVunder a credible certification program.
p375
aVWhy is Cargill important?
p376
aVBecause Cargill has 20 to 25 percent
p377
aVof global palm oil.
p378
aVIf Cargill makes a decision,
p379
aVthe entire palm oil industry moves,
p380
aVor at least 40 or 50 percent of it.
p381
aVThat's not insignificant.
p382
aVMore importantly, Cargill and one other company
p383
aVship 50 percent of the palm oil
p384
aVthat goes to China.
p385
aVWe don't have to change the way
p386
aVa single Chinese company works
p387
aVif we get Cargill to only send
p388
aVsustainable palm oil to China.
p389
aVIt's a pre-competitive issue.
p390
aVAll the palm oil going there is good.
p391
aVBuy it.
p392
aa(lp393
VMars is also on a similar journey.
p394
aVNow most people understand that Mars is a chocolate company,
p395
aVbut Mars has made sustainability pledges
p396
aVto buy only certified product for all of its seafood.
p397
aVIt turns out Mars buys more seafood than Walmart
p398
aVbecause of pet food.
p399
aVBut they're doing some really interesting things around chocolate,
p400
aVand it all comes from the fact
p401
aVthat Mars wants to be in business in the future.
p402
aVAnd what they see is that they need to
p403
aVimprove chocolate production.
p404
aVOn any given plantation,
p405
aV20 percent of the trees produce 80 percent of the crop,
p406
aVso Mars is looking at the genome,
p407
aVthey're sequencing the genome of the cocoa plant.
p408
aVThey're doing it with IBM and the USDA,
p409
aVand they're putting it in the public domain
p410
aVbecause they want everybody to have access to this data,
p411
aVbecause they want everybody to help them
p412
aVmake cocoa more productive and more sustainable.
p413
aVWhat they've realized
p414
aVis that if they can identify the traits
p415
aVon productivity and drought tolerance,
p416
aVthey can produce 320 percent as much cocoa
p417
aVon 40 percent of the land.
p418
aVThe rest of the land can be used for something else.
p419
aVIt's more with less and less again.
p420
aVThat's what the future has got to be,
p421
aVand putting it in the public domain is smart.
p422
aVThey don't want to be an I.P. company; they want to be a chocolate company,
p423
aVbut they want to be a chocolate company forever.
p424
aa(lp425
VNow, the price of food, many people complain about,
p426
aVbut in fact, the price of food is going down,
p427
aVand that's odd because in fact,
p428
aVconsumers are not paying for the true cost of food.
p429
aVIf you take a look just at water,
p430
aVwhat we see is that,
p431
aVwith four very common products,
p432
aVyou look at how much a farmer produced to make those products,
p433
aVand then you look at how much water input was put into them,
p434
aVand then you look at what the farmer was paid.
p435
aVIf you divide the amount of water
p436
aVinto what the farmer was paid,
p437
aVthe farmer didn't receive enough money
p438
aVto pay a decent price for water in any of those commodities.
p439
aVThat is an externality by definition.
p440
aVThis is the subsidy from nature.
p441
aVCoca-Cola, they've worked a lot on water,
p442
aVbut right now, they're entering into 17-year contracts
p443
aVwith growers in Turkey
p444
aVto sell juice into Europe,
p445
aVand they're doing that because they want to have a product
p446
aVthat's closer to the European market.
p447
aVBut they're not just buying the juice;
p448
aVthey're also buying the carbon in the trees
p449
aVto offset the shipment costs associated with carbon
p450
aVto get the product into Europe.
p451
aVThere's carbon that's being bought with sugar,
p452
