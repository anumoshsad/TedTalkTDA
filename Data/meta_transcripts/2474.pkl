VSeven years ago, a student came to me and asked me to invest in his company.
p4
aVHe said, "I'm working with three friends,
p5
aVand we're going to try to disrupt an industry by selling stuff online."
p6
aVAnd I said, "OK, you guys spent the whole summer on this, right?"
p7
aV"No, we all took internships just in case it doesn't work out."
p8
aV"All right, but you're going to go in full time once you graduate."
p9
aV"Not exactly. We've all lined up backup jobs."
p10
aVSix months go by,
p11
aVit's the day before the company launches,
p12
aVand there is still not a functioning website.
p13
aV"You guys realize, the entire company is a website.
p14
aVThat's literally all it is."
p15
aVSo I obviously declined to invest.
p16
aa(lp17
VAnd they ended up naming the company Warby Parker.
p18
aa(lp19
V(Laughter)
p20
aVThey sell glasses online.
p21
aVThey were recently recognized as the world's most innovative company
p22
aVand valued at over a billion dollars.
p23
aVAnd now? My wife handles our investments.
p24
aVWhy was I so wrong?
p25
aa(lp26
VTo find out, I've been studying people that I come to call "originals."
p27
aVOriginals are nonconformists,
p28
aVpeople who not only have new ideas
p29
aVbut take action to champion them.
p30
aVThey are people who stand out and speak up.
p31
aVOriginals drive creativity and change in the world.
p32
aVThey're the people you want to bet on.
p33
aVAnd they look nothing like I expected.
p34
aVI want to show you today three things I've learned
p35
aVabout recognizing originals
p36
aVand becoming a little bit more like them.
p37
aa(lp38
VSo the first reason that I passed on Warby Parker
p39
aVwas they were really slow getting off the ground.
p40
aVNow, you are all intimately familiar with the mind of a procrastinator.
p41
aVWell, I have a confession for you. I'm the opposite. I'm a precrastinator.
p42
aVYes, that's an actual term.
p43
aVYou know that panic you feel a few hours before a big deadline
p44
aVwhen you haven't done anything yet.
p45
aVI just feel that a few months ahead of time.
p46
aa(lp47
V(Laughter)
p48
aa(lp49
VSo this started early: when I was a kid, I took Nintendo games very seriously.
p50
aVI would wake up at 5am,
p51
aVstart playing and not stop until I had mastered them.
p52
aVEventually it got so out of hand that a local newspaper came
p53
aVand did a story on the dark side of Nintendo, starring me.
p54
aa(lp55
V(Laughter)
p56
aa(lp57
V(Applause)
p58
aa(lp59
VSince then, I have traded hair for teeth.
p60
aa(lp61
V(Laughter)
p62
aa(lp63
VBut this served me well in college,
p64
aVbecause I finished my senior thesis four months before the deadline.
p65
aVAnd I was proud of that, until a few years ago.
p66
aVI had a student named Jihae, who came to me and said,
p67
aV"I have my most creative ideas when I'm procrastinating."
p68
aVAnd I was like, "That's cute, where are the four papers you owe me?"
p69
aa(lp70
V(Laughter)
p71
aa(lp72
VNo, she was one of our most creative students,
p73
aVand as an organizational psychologist, this is the kind of idea that I test.
p74
aVSo I challenged her to get some data.
p75
aVShe goes into a bunch of companies.
p76
aVShe has people fill out surveys about how often they procrastinate.
p77
aVThen she gets their bosses to rate how creative and innovative they are.
p78
aVAnd sure enough, the precrastinators like me,
p79
aVwho rush in and do everything early
p80
aVare rated as less creative
p81
aVthan people who procrastinate moderately.
p82
aVSo I want to know what happens to the chronic procrastinators.
p83
aVShe was like, "I don't know. They didn't fill out my survey."
p84
aa(lp85
V(Laughter)
p86
aa(lp87
VNo, here are our results.
p88
aVYou actually do see that the people who wait until the last minute
p89
aVare so busy goofing off that they don't have any new ideas.
p90
aVAnd on the flip side, the people who race in
p91
aVare in such a frenzy of anxiety that they don't have original thoughts either.
p92
aVThere's a sweet spot where originals seem to live.
p93
aVWhy is this?
p94
aVMaybe original people just have bad work habits.
p95
aVMaybe procrastinating does not cause creativity.
p96
aa(lp97
VTo find out, we designed some experiments.
p98
aVWe asked people to generate new business ideas,
p99
aVand then we get independent readers
p100
aVto evaluate how creative and useful they are.
p101
aVAnd some of them are asked to do the task right away.
p102
aVOthers we randomly assign to procrastinate
p103
aVby dangling Minesweeper in front of them
p104
aVfor either five or 10 minutes.
p105
aVAnd sure enough, the moderate procrastinators
p106
aVare 16 percent more creative than the other two groups.
p107
aVNow, Minesweeper is awesome, but it's not the driver of the effect,
p108
aVbecause if you play the game first before you learn about the task,
p109
aVthere's no creativity boost.
p110
aVIt's only when you're told that you're going to be working on this problem,
p111
aVand then you start procrastinating,
p112
aVbut the task is still active in the back of your mind,
p113
aVthat you start to incubate.
p114
aVProcrastination gives you time to consider divergent ideas,
p115
aVto think in nonlinear ways, to make unexpected leaps.
p116
aa(lp117
VSo just as we were finishing these experiments,
p118
aVI was starting to write a book about originals,
p119
aVand I thought, "This is the perfect time to teach myself to procrastinate,
p120
aVwhile writing a chapter on procrastination."
p121
aVSo I metaprocrastinated,
p122
aVand like any self-respecting precrastinator,
p123
aVI woke up early the next morning
p124
aVand I made a to-do list with steps on how to procrastinate.
p125
aa(lp126
V(Laughter)
p127
aa(lp128
VAnd then I worked diligently
p129
aVtoward my goal of not making progress toward my goal.
p130
aVI started writing the procrastination chapter,
p131
aVand one day \u2014 I was halfway through \u2014
p132
aVI literally put it away in mid-sentence
p133
aVfor months.
p134
aVIt was agony.
p135
aVBut when I came back to it, I had all sorts of new ideas.
p136
aVAs Aaron Sorkin put it,
p137
aV"You call it procrastinating. I call it thinking."
p138
aVAnd along the way I discovered
p139
aVthat a lot of great originals in history were procrastinators.
p140
aVTake Leonardo da Vinci.
p141
aVHe toiled on and off for 16 years
p142
aVon the Mona Lisa.
p143
aVHe felt like a failure.
p144
aVHe wrote as much in his journal.
p145
aVBut some of the diversions he took in optics
p146
aVtransformed the way that he modeled light
p147
aVand made him into a much better painter.
p148
aVWhat about Martin Luther King, Jr.?
p149
aVThe night before the biggest speech of his life,
p150
aVthe March on Washington,
p151
aVhe was up past 3am, rewriting it.
p152
aVHe's sitting in the audience waiting for his turn to go onstage,
p153
aVand he is still scribbling notes and crossing out lines.
p154
aVWhen he gets onstage, 11 minutes in,
p155
aVhe leaves his prepared remarks
p156
aVto utter four words that changed the course of history:
p157
aV"I have a dream."
p158
aVThat was not in the script.
p159
aVBy delaying the task of finalizing the speech until the very last minute,
p160
aVhe left himself open to the widest range of possible ideas.
p161
aVAnd because the text wasn't set in stone,
p162
aVhe had freedom to improvise.
p163
aa(lp164
VProcrastinating is a vice when it comes to productivity,
p165
aVbut it can be a virtue for creativity.
p166
aVWhat you see with a lot of great originals
p167
aVis that they are quick to start but they're slow to finish.
p168
aVAnd this is what I missed with Warby Parker.
p169
aVWhen they were dragging their heels for six months,
p170
aVI looked at them and said,
p171
aV"You know, a lot of other companies are starting to sell glasses online."
p172
aVThey missed the first-mover advantage.
p173
aVBut what I didn't realize was they were spending all that time
p174
aVtrying to figure out how to get people
p175
aVto be comfortable ordering glasses online.
p176
aVAnd it turns out the first-mover advantage is mostly a myth.
p177
aVLook at a classic study of over 50 product categories,
p178
aVcomparing the first movers who created the market
p179
aVwith the improvers who introduced something different and better.
p180
aVWhat you see is that the first movers had a failure rate of 47 percent,
p181
aVcompared with only 8 percent for the improvers.
p182
aVLook at Facebook, waiting to build a social network
p183
aVuntil after Myspace and Friendster.
p184
aVLook at Google, waiting for years after Altavista and Yahoo.
p185
aVIt's much easier to improve on somebody else's idea
p186
aVthan it is to create something new from scratch.
p187
aVSo the lesson I learned is that to be original you don't have to be first.
p188
aVYou just have to be different and better.
p189
aa(lp190
VBut that wasn't the only reason I passed on Warby Parker.
p191
aVThey were also full of doubts.
p192
aVThey had backup plans lined up,
p193
aVand that made me doubt that they had the courage to be original,
p194
aVbecause I expected that originals would look something like this.
p195
aa(lp196
V(Laughter)
p197
aa(lp198
VNow, on the surface,
p199
aVa lot of original people look confident,
p200
aVbut behind the scenes,
p201
aVthey feel the same fear and doubt that the rest of us do.
p202
aVThey just manage it differently.
p203
aVLet me show you: this is a depiction
p204
aVof how the creative process works for most of us.
p205
aa(lp206
V(Laughter)
p207
aa(lp208
VNow, in my research, I discovered there are two different kinds of doubt.
p209
aVThere's self-doubt and idea doubt.
p210
aVSelf-doubt is paralyzing.
p211
aVIt leads you to freeze.
p212
aVBut idea doubt is energizing.
p213
aVIt motivates you to test, to experiment, to refine,
p214
aVjust like MLK did.
p215
aVAnd so the key to being original
p216
aVis just a simple thing
p217
aVof avoiding the leap from step three to step four.
p218
aVInstead of saying, "I'm crap,"
p219
aVyou say, "The first few drafts are always crap,
p220
aVand I'm just not there yet."
p221
aVSo how do you get there?
p222
aVWell, there's a clue, it turns out,
p223
aVin the Internet browser that you use.
p224
aVWe can predict your job performance and your commitment
p225
aVjust by knowing what web browser you use.
p226
aVNow, some of you are not going to like the results of this study \u2014
p227
aa(lp228
V(Laughter)
p229
aa(lp230
VBut there is good evidence that Firefox and Chrome users
p231
aVsignificantly outperform Internet Explorer and Safari users.
p232
aVYes.
p233
aa(lp234
V(Applause)
p235
aa(lp236
VThey also stay in their jobs 15 percent longer, by the way.
p237
aVWhy? It's not a technical advantage.
p238
aVThe four browser groups on average have similar typing speed
p239
aVand they also have similar levels of computer knowledge.
p240
aVIt's about how you got the browser.
p241
aVBecause if you use Internet Explorer or Safari,
p242
aVthose came preinstalled on your computer,
p243
aVand you accepted the default option that was handed to you.
p244
aVIf you wanted Firefox or Chrome, you had to doubt the default
p245
aVand ask, is there a different option out there,
p246
aVand then be a little resourceful and download a new browser.
p247
aVSo people hear about this study and they're like,
p248
aV"Great, if I want to get better at my job, I just need to upgrade my browser?"
p249
aa(lp250
V(Laughter)
p251
aa(lp252
VNo, it's about being the kind of person
p253
aVwho takes the initiative to doubt the default
p254
aVand look for a better option.
p255
aVAnd if you do that well,
p256
aVyou will open yourself up to the opposite of déjà vu.
p257
aVThere's a name for it. It's called vuja de.
p258
aa(lp259
V(Laughter)
p260
aa(lp261
VVuja de is when you look at something you've seen many times before
p262
aVand all of a sudden see it with fresh eyes.
p263
aVIt's a screenwriter who looks at a movie script
p264
aVthat can't get the green light for more than half a century.
p265
aVIn every past version, the main character has been an evil queen.
p266
aVBut Jennifer Lee starts to question whether that makes sense.
p267
aVShe rewrites the first act,
p268
aVreinvents the villain as a tortured hero
p269
aVand Frozen becomes the most successful animated movie ever.
p270
aVSo there's a simple message from this story.
p271
aVWhen you feel doubt, don't let it go.
p272
aa(lp273
V(Laughter)
p274
aa(lp275
VWhat about fear?
p276
aVOriginals feel fear, too.
p277
aVThey're afraid of failing,
p278
aVbut what sets them apart from the rest of us
p279
aVis that they're even more afraid of failing to try.
p280
aVThey know you can fail by starting a business that goes bankrupt
p281
aVor by failing to start a business at all.
p282
aVThey know that in the long run, our biggest regrets are not our actions
p283
aVbut our inactions.
p284
aVThe things we wish we could redo, if you look at the science,
p285
aVare the chances not taken.
p286
aa(lp287
VElon Musk told me recently, he didn't expect Tesla to succeed.
p288
aVHe was sure the first few SpaceX launches
p289
aVwould fail to make it to orbit, let alone get back,
p290
aVbut it was too important not to try.
p291
aVAnd for so many of us, when we have an important idea,
p292
aVwe don't bother to try.
p293
aVBut I have some good news for you.
p294
aVYou are not going to get judged on your bad ideas.
p295
aVA lot of people think they will.
p296
aVIf you look across industries
p297
aVand ask people about their biggest idea, their most important suggestion,
p298
aV85 percent of them stayed silent instead of speaking up.
p299
aVThey were afraid of embarrassing themselves, of looking stupid.
p300
aVBut guess what? Originals have lots and lots of bad ideas,
p301
aVtons of them, in fact.
p302
aVTake the guy who invented this.
p303
aVDo you care that he came up with a talking doll so creepy
p304
aVthat it scared not only kids but adults, too?
p305
aVNo. You celebrate Thomas Edison for pioneering the light bulb.
p306
aa(lp307
V(Laughter)
p308
aa(lp309
VIf you look across fields,
p310
aVthe greatest originals are the ones who fail the most,
p311
aVbecause they're the ones who try the most.
p312
aVTake classical composers, the best of the best.
p313
aVWhy do some of them get more pages in encyclopedias than others
p314
aVand also have their compositions rerecorded more times?
p315
aVOne of the best predictors
p316
aVis the sheer volume of compositions that they generate.
p317
aVThe more output you churn out, the more variety you get
p318
aVand the better your chances of stumbling on something truly original.
p319
aVEven the three icons of classical music \u2014 Bach, Beethoven, Mozart \u2014
p320
aVhad to generate hundreds and hundreds of compositions
p321
aVto come up with a much smaller number of masterpieces.
p322
aVNow, you may be wondering,
p323
aVhow did this guy become great without doing a whole lot?
p324
aVI don't know how Wagner pulled that off.
p325
aVBut for most of us, if we want to be more original,
p326
aVwe have to generate more ideas.
p327
aa(lp328
VThe Warby Parker founders, when they were trying to name their company,
p329
aVthey needed something sophisticated, unique, with no negative associations
p330
aVto build a retail brand,
p331
aVand they tested over 2,000 possibilities
p332
aVbefore they finally put together
p333
aVWarby and Parker.
p334
aVSo if you put all this together, what you see is that originals
p335
aVare not that different from the rest of us.
p336
aVThey feel fear and doubt. They procrastinate.
p337
aVThey have bad ideas.
p338
aVAnd sometimes, it's not in spite of those qualities but because of them
p339
aVthat they succeed.
p340
aa(lp341
VSo when you see those things, don't make the same mistake I did.
p342
aVDon't write them off.
p343
aVAnd when that's you, don't count yourself out either.
p344
aVKnow that being quick to start but slow to finish
p345
aVcan boost your creativity,
p346
aVthat you can motivate yourself by doubting your ideas
p347
aVand embracing the fear of failing to try,
p348
aVand that you need a lot of bad ideas in order to get a few good ones.
p349
aa(lp350
VLook, being original is not easy,
p351
aVbut I have no doubt about this:
p352
aVit's the best way to improve the world around us.
p353
aa(lp354
VThank you.
