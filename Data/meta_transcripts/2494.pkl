(lp3
VSo this is a talk about gene drives,
p4
aVbut I'm going to start by telling you a brief story.
p5
aV20 years ago, a biologist named Anthony James
p6
aVgot obsessed with the idea of making mosquitos
p7
aVthat didn't transmit malaria.
p8
aa(lp9
VIt was a great idea, and pretty much a complete failure.
p10
aVFor one thing, it turned out to be really hard
p11
aVto make a malaria-resistant mosquito.
p12
aVJames managed it, finally, just a few years ago,
p13
aVby adding some genes that make it impossible
p14
aVfor the malaria parasite to survive inside the mosquito.
p15
aa(lp16
VBut that just created another problem.
p17
aVNow that you've got a malaria-resistant mosquito,
p18
aVhow do you get it to replace all the malaria-carrying mosquitos?
p19
aVThere are a couple options,
p20
aVbut plan A was basically to breed up
p21
aVa bunch of the new genetically-engineered mosquitos
p22
aVrelease them into the wild
p23
aVand hope that they pass on their genes.
p24
aVThe problem was that you'd have to release
p25
aVliterally 10 times the number of native mosquitos to work.
p26
aVSo in a village with 10,000 mosquitos,
p27
aVyou release an extra 100,000.
p28
aVAs you might guess,
p29
aVthis was not a very popular strategy with the villagers.
p30
aa(lp31
V(Laughter)
p32
aa(lp33
VThen, last January, Anthony James got an email
p34
aVfrom a biologist named Ethan Bier.
p35
aVBier said that he and his grad student Valentino Gantz
p36
aVhad stumbled on a tool that could not only guarantee
p37
aVthat a particular genetic trait would be inherited,
p38
aVbut that it would spread incredibly quickly.
p39
aVIf they were right, it would basically solve the problem
p40
aVthat he and James had been working on for 20 years.
p41
aa(lp42
VAs a test, they engineered two mosquitos to carry the anti-malaria gene
p43
aVand also this new tool, a gene drive,
p44
aVwhich I'll explain in a minute.
p45
aVFinally, they set it up so that any mosquitos
p46
aVthat had inherited the anti-malaria gene
p47
aVwouldn't have the usual white eyes, but would instead have red eyes.
p48
aVThat was pretty much just for convenience
p49
aVso they could tell just at a glance which was which.
p50
aa(lp51
VSo they took their two anti-malarial, red-eyed mosquitos
p52
aVand put them in a box with 30 ordinary white-eyed ones,
p53
aVand let them breed.
p54
aVIn two generations, those had produced 3,800 grandchildren.
p55
aVThat is not the surprising part.
p56
aVThis is the surprising part:
p57
aVgiven that you started with just two red-eyed mosquitos
p58
aVand 30 white-eyed ones,
p59
aVyou expect mostly white-eyed descendants.
p60
aVInstead, when James opened the box,
p61
aVall 3,800 mosquitos had red eyes.
p62
aa(lp63
VWhen I asked Ethan Bier about this moment,
p64
aVhe became so excited that he was literally shouting into the phone.
p65
aVThat's because getting only red-eyed mosquitos
p66
aVviolates a rule that is the absolute cornerstone of biology,
p67
aVMendelian genetics.
p68
aVI'll keep this quick,
p69
aVbut Mendelian genetics says when a male and a female mate,
p70
aVtheir baby inherits half of its DNA from each parent.
p71
aVSo if our original mosquito was aa and our new mosquito is aB,
p72
aVwhere B is the anti-malarial gene,
p73
aVthe babies should come out in four permutations:
p74
aVaa, aB, aa, Ba.
p75
aVInstead, with the new gene drive,
p76
aVthey all came out aB.
p77
aVBiologically, that shouldn't even be possible.
p78
aa(lp79
VSo what happened?
p80
aVThe first thing that happened
p81
aVwas the arrival of a gene-editing tool known as CRISPR in 2012.
p82
aVMany of you have probably heard about CRISPR,
p83
aVso I'll just say briefly that CRISPR is a tool that allows researchers
p84
aVto edit genes very precisely, easily and quickly.
p85
aVIt does this by harnessing a mechanism that already existed in bacteria.
p86
aVBasically, there's a protein that acts like a scissors
p87
aVand cuts the DNA,
p88
aVand there's an RNA molecule that directs the scissors
p89
aVto any point on the genome you want.
p90
aVThe result is basically a word processor for genes.
p91
aVYou can take an entire gene out, put one in,
p92
aVor even edit just a single letter within a gene.
p93
aVAnd you can do it in nearly any species.
p94
aa(lp95
VOK, remember how I said that gene drives originally had two problems?
p96
aVThe first was that it was hard to engineer a mosquito
p97
aVto be malaria-resistant.
p98
aVThat's basically gone now, thanks to CRISPR.
p99
aVBut the other problem was logistical.
p100
aVHow do you get your trait to spread?
p101
aVThis is where it gets clever.
p102
aa(lp103
VA couple years ago, a biologist at Harvard named Kevin Esvelt
p104
aVwondered what would happen
p105
aVif you made it so that CRISPR inserted not only your new gene
p106
aVbut also the machinery that does the cutting and pasting.
p107
aVIn other words, what if CRISPR also copied and pasted itself.
p108
aVYou'd end up with a perpetual motion machine for gene editing.
p109
aVAnd that's exactly what happened.
p110
aVThis CRISPR gene drive that Esvelt created
p111
aVnot only guarantees that a trait will get passed on,
p112
aVbut if it's used in the germline cells,
p113
aVit will automatically copy and paste your new gene
p114
aVinto both chromosomes of every single individual.
p115
aVIt's like a global search and replace,
p116
aVor in science terms, it makes a heterozygous trait homozygous.
p117
aa(lp118
VSo, what does this mean?
p119
aVFor one thing, it means we have a very powerful,
p120
aVbut also somewhat alarming new tool.
p121
aVUp until now, the fact that gene drives didn't work very well
p122
aVwas actually kind of a relief.
p123
aVNormally when we mess around with an organism's genes,
p124
aVwe make that thing less evolutionarily fit.
p125
aVSo biologists can make all the mutant fruit flies they want
p126
aVwithout worrying about it.
p127
aVIf some escape, natural selection just takes care of them.
p128
aa(lp129
VWhat's remarkable and powerful and frightening about gene drives
p130
aVis that that will no longer be true.
p131
aVAssuming that your trait does not have a big evolutionary handicap,
p132
aVlike a mosquito that can't fly,
p133
aVthe CRISPR-based gene drive will spread the change relentlessly
p134
aVuntil it is in every single individual in the population.
p135
aVNow, it isn't easy to make a gene drive that works that well,
p136
aVbut James and Esvelt think that we can.
p137
aa(lp138
VThe good news is that this opens the door to some remarkable things.
p139
aVIf you put an anti-malarial gene drive
p140
aVin just 1 percent of Anopheles mosquitoes,
p141
aVthe species that transmits malaria,
p142
aVresearchers estimate that it would spread to the entire population in a year.
p143
aVSo in a year, you could virtually eliminate malaria.
p144
aVIn practice, we're still a few years out from being able to do that,
p145
aVbut still, a 1,000 children a day die of malaria.
p146
aVIn a year, that number could be almost zero.
p147
aVThe same goes for dengue fever, chikungunya, yellow fever.
p148
aa(lp149
VAnd it gets better.
p150
aVSay you want to get rid of an invasive species,
p151
aVlike get Asian carp out of the Great Lakes.
p152
aVAll you have to do is release a gene drive
p153
aVthat makes the fish produce only male offspring.
p154
aVIn a few generations, there'll be no females left, no more carp.
p155
aVIn theory, this means we could restore hundreds of native species
p156
aVthat have been pushed to the brink.
p157
aa(lp158
VOK, that's the good news,
p159
aVthis is the bad news.
p160
aVGene drives are so effective
p161
aVthat even an accidental release could change an entire species,
p162
aVand often very quickly.
p163
aVAnthony James took good precautions.
p164
aVHe bred his mosquitos in a bio-containment lab
p165
aVand he also used a species that's not native to the US
p166
aVso that even if some did escape,
p167
aVthey'd just die off, there'd be nothing for them to mate with.
p168
aVBut it's also true that if a dozen Asian carp with the all-male gene drive
p169
aVaccidentally got carried from the Great Lakes back to Asia,
p170
aVthey could potentially wipe out the native Asian carp population.
p171
aVAnd that's not so unlikely, given how connected our world is.
p172
aVIn fact, it's why we have an invasive species problem.
p173
aVAnd that's fish.
p174
aVThings like mosquitos and fruit flies,
p175
aVthere's literally no way to contain them.
p176
aVThey cross borders and oceans all the time.
p177
aa(lp178
VOK, the other piece of bad news
p179
aVis that a gene drive might not stay confined
p180
aVto what we call the target species.
p181
aVThat's because of gene flow,
p182
aVwhich is a fancy way of saying that neighboring species
p183
aVsometimes interbreed.
p184
aVIf that happens, it's possible a gene drive could cross over,
p185
aVlike Asian carp could infect some other kind of carp.
p186
aVThat's not so bad if your drive just promotes a trait, like eye color.
p187
aVIn fact, there's a decent chance that we'll see
p188
aVa wave of very weird fruit flies in the near future.
p189
aVBut it could be a disaster
p190
aVif your drive is deigned to eliminate the species entirely.
p191
aa(lp192
VThe last worrisome thing is that the technology to do this,
p193
aVto genetically engineer an organism and include a gene drive,
p194
aVis something that basically any lab in the world can do.
p195
aVAn undergraduate can do it.
p196
aVA talented high schooler with some equipment can do it.
p197
aa(lp198
VNow, I'm guessing that this sounds terrifying.
p199
aa(lp200
V(Laughter)
p201
aa(lp202
VInterestingly though, nearly every scientist I talk to
p203
aVseemed to think that gene drives were not actually that frightening or dangerous.
p204
aVPartly because they believe that scientists will be
p205
aVvery cautious and responsible about using them.
p206
aa(lp207
V(Laughter)
p208
aa(lp209
VSo far, that's been true.
p210
aVBut gene drives also have some actual limitations.
p211
aVSo for one thing, they work only in sexually reproducing species.
p212
aVSo thank goodness, they can't be used to engineer viruses or bacteria.
p213
aVAlso, the trait spreads only with each successive generation.
p214
aVSo changing or eliminating a population
p215
aVis practical only if that species has a fast reproductive cycle,
p216
aVlike insects or maybe small vertebrates like mice or fish.
p217
aVIn elephants or people, it would take centuries
p218
aVfor a trait to spread widely enough to matter.
p219
aa(lp220
VAlso, even with CRISPR, it's not that easy to engineer a truly devastating trait.
p221
aVSay you wanted to make a fruit fly
p222
aVthat feeds on ordinary fruit instead of rotting fruit,
p223
aVwith the aim of sabotaging American agriculture.
p224
aVFirst, you'd have to figure out
p225
aVwhich genes control what the fly wants to eat,
p226
aVwhich is already a very long and complicated project.
p227
aVThen you'd have to alter those genes to change the fly's behavior
p228
aVto whatever you'd want it to be,
p229
aVwhich is an even longer and more complicated project.
p230
aVAnd it might not even work,
p231
aVbecause the genes that control behavior are complex.
p232
aVSo if you're a terrorist and have to choose
p233
aVbetween starting a grueling basic research program
p234
aVthat will require years of meticulous lab work and still might not pan out,
p235
aVor just blowing stuff up?
p236
aVYou'll probably choose the later.
p237
aa(lp238
VThis is especially true because at least in theory,
p239
aVit should be pretty easy to build what's called a reversal drive.
p240
aVThat's one that basically overwrites the change made by the first gene drive.
p241
aVSo if you don't like the effects of a change,
p242
aVyou can just release a second drive that will cancel it out,
p243
aVat least in theory.
p244
aa(lp245
VOK, so where does this leave us?
p246
aVWe now have the ability to change entire species at will.
p247
aVShould we?
p248
aVAre we gods now?
p249
aVI'm not sure I'd say that.
p250
aVBut I would say this:
p251
aVfirst, some very smart people
p252
aVare even now debating how to regulate gene drives.
p253
aVAt the same time, some other very smart people
p254
aVare working hard to create safeguards,
p255
aVlike gene drives that self-regulate or peter out after a few generations.
p256
aVThat's great.
p257
aVBut this technology still requires a conversation.
p258
aVAnd given the nature of gene drives,
p259
aVthat conversation has to be global.
p260
aVWhat if Kenya wants to use a drive but Tanzania doesn't?
p261
aVWho decides whether to release a gene drive that can fly?
p262
aa(lp263
VI don't have the answer to that question.
p264
aVAll we can do going forward, I think,
p265
aVis talk honestly about the risks and benefits
p266
aVand take responsibility for our choices.
p267
aVBy that I mean, not just the choice to use a gene drive,
p268
aVbut also the choice not to use one.
p269
aVHumans have a tendency to assume that the safest option
p270
aVis to preserve the status quo.
p271
aVBut that's not always the case.
p272
aVGene drives have risks, and those need to be discussed,
p273
aVbut malaria exists now and kills 1,000 people a day.
p274
aVTo combat it, we spray pesticides that do grave damage to other species,
p275
aVincluding amphibians and birds.
p276
aa(lp277
VSo when you hear about gene drives in the coming months,
p278
aVand trust me, you will be hearing about them,
p279
aVremember that.
p280
aVIt can be frightening to act,
p281
aVbut sometimes, not acting is worse.
