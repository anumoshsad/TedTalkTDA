VHow can I speak in 10 minutes
p4
aVabout the bonds of women over three generations,
p5
aVabout how the astonishing strength of those bonds
p6
aVtook hold in the life of a four-year-old girl
p7
aVhuddled with her young sister, her mother and her grandmother
p8
aVfor five days and nights in a small boat in the China Sea
p9
aVmore than 30 years ago.
p10
aVBonds that took hold in the life of that small girl
p11
aVand never let go \u2014
p12
aVthat small girl now living in San Francisco
p13
aVand speaking to you today.
p14
aVThis is not a finished story.
p15
aVIt is a jigsaw puzzle still being put together.
p16
aVLet me tell you about some of the pieces.
p17
aa(lp18
VImagine the first piece: a man burning his life's work.
p19
aVHe is a poet, a playwright,
p20
aVa man whose whole life
p21
aVhad been balanced on the single hope of his country's unity and freedom.
p22
aVImagine him as the communists enter Saigon \u2014
p23
aVconfronting the fact that his life had been a complete waste.
p24
aVWords, for so long his friends, now mocked him.
p25
aVHe retreated into silence.
p26
aVHe died broken by history.
p27
aVHe is my grandfather.
p28
aVI never knew him in real life.
p29
aVBut our lives are much more than our memories.
p30
aVMy grandmother never let me forget his life.
p31
aVMy duty was not to allow it to have been in vain,
p32
aVand my lesson was to learn that, yes, history tried to crush us,
p33
aVbut we endured.
p34
aa(lp35
VThe next piece of the jigsaw is of a boat in the early dawn
p36
aVslipping silently out to sea.
p37
aVMy mother, Mai, was 18 when her father died \u2014
p38
aValready in an arranged marriage,
p39
aValready with two small girls.
p40
aVFor her, life had distilled itself into one task:
p41
aVthe escape of her family and a new life in Australia.
p42
aVIt was inconceivable to her that she would not succeed.
p43
aVSo after a four-year saga that defies fiction,
p44
aVa boat slipped out to sea disguised as a fishing vessel.
p45
aVAll the adults knew the risks.
p46
aVThe greatest fear was of pirates, rape and death.
p47
aVLike most adults on the boat,
p48
aVmy mother carried a small bottle of poison.
p49
aVIf we were captured, first my sister and I,
p50
aVthen she and my grandmother would drink.
p51
aa(lp52
VMy first memories are from the boat \u2014
p53
aVthe steady beat of the engine,
p54
aVthe bow dipping into each wave,
p55
aVthe vast and empty horizon.
p56
aVI don't remember the pirates who came many times,
p57
aVbut were bluffed by the bravado of the men on our boat,
p58
aVor the engine dying and failing to start for six hours.
p59
aVBut I do remember the lights on the oil rig off the Malaysian coast
p60
aVand the young man who collapsed and died,
p61
aVthe journey's end too much for him,
p62
aVand the first apple I tasted, given to me by the men on the rig.
p63
aVNo apple has ever tasted the same.
p64
aa(lp65
VAfter three months in a refugee camp, we landed in Melbourne.
p66
aVAnd the next piece of the jigsaw is about four women
p67
aVacross three generations shaping a new life together.
p68
aVWe settled in Footscray,
p69
aVa working-class suburb whose demographic is layers of immigrants.
p70
aVUnlike the settled middle-class suburbs, whose existence I was oblivious of,
p71
aVthere was no sense of entitlement in Footscray.
p72
aVThe smells from shop doors were from the rest of the world.
p73
aVAnd the snippets of halting English
p74
aVwere exchanged between people who had one thing in common:
p75
aVThey were starting again.
p76
aa(lp77
VMy mother worked on farms,
p78
aVthen on a car assembly line,
p79
aVworking six days, double shifts.
p80
aVSomehow, she found time to study English
p81
aVand gain IT qualifications.
p82
aVWe were poor.
p83
aVAll the dollars were allocated
p84
aVand extra tuition in English and mathematics was budgeted for
p85
aVregardless of what missed out,
p86
aVwhich was usually new clothes;
p87
aVthey were always secondhand.
p88
aVTwo pairs of stockings for school,
p89
aVeach to hide the holes in the other.
p90
aVA school uniform down to the ankles, because it had to last for six years.
p91
aVAnd there were rare but searing chants of "slit-eye"
p92
aVand the occasional graffiti:
p93
aV"Asian, go home."
p94
aVGo home to where?
p95
aVSomething stiffened inside me.
p96
aVThere was a gathering of resolve and a quiet voice saying,
p97
aV"I will bypass you."
p98
aa(lp99
VMy mother, my sister and I slept in the same bed.
p100
aVMy mother was exhausted each night,
p101
aVbut we told one another about our day
p102
aVand listened to the movements of my grandmother around the house.
p103
aVMy mother suffered from nightmares, all about the boat.
p104
aVAnd my job was to stay awake until her nightmares came
p105
aVso I could wake her.
p106
aVShe opened a computer store,
p107
aVthen studied to be a beautician and opened another business.
p108
aVAnd the women came with their stories
p109
aVabout men who could not make the transition,
p110
aVangry and inflexible,
p111
aVand troubled children caught between two worlds.
p112
aa(lp113
VGrants and sponsors were sought.
p114
aVCenters were established.
p115
aVI lived in parallel worlds.
p116
aVIn one, I was the classic Asian student,
p117
aVrelentless in the demands that I made on myself.
p118
aVIn the other, I was enmeshed in lives that were precarious,
p119
aVtragically scarred by violence, drug abuse and isolation.
p120
aVBut so many over the years were helped.
p121
aVAnd for that work, when I was a final-year law student,
p122
aVI was chosen as the Young Australian of the Year.
p123
aVAnd I was catapulted from one piece of the jigsaw to another,
p124
aVand their edges didn't fit.
p125
aa(lp126
VTan Le, anonymous Footscray resident,
p127
aVwas now Tan Le, refugee and social activist,
p128
aVinvited to speak in venues she had never heard of
p129
aVand into homes whose existence she could never have imagined.
p130
aVI didn't know the protocols.
p131
aVI didn't know how to use the cutlery.
p132
aVI didn't know how to talk about wine.
p133
aVI didn't know how to talk about anything.
p134
aVI wanted to retreat to the routines and comfort
p135
aVof life in an unsung suburb \u2014
p136
aVa grandmother, a mother and two daughters
p137
aVending each day as they had for almost 20 years,
p138
aVtelling one another the story of their day
p139
aVand falling asleep, the three of us still in the same bed.
p140
aVI told my mother I couldn't do it.
p141
aVShe reminded me that I was now the same age she had been
p142
aVwhen we boarded the boat.
p143
aV"No" had never been an option.
p144
aV"Just do it," she said,
p145
aV"and don't be what you're not."
p146
aa(lp147
VSo I spoke out on youth unemployment and education
p148
aVand the neglect of the marginalized and disenfranchised.
p149
aVAnd the more candidly I spoke, the more I was asked to speak.
p150
aVI met people from all walks of life,
p151
aVso many of them doing the thing they loved,
p152
aVliving on the frontiers of possibility.
p153
aVAnd even though I finished my degree,
p154
aVI realized I could not settle into a career in law.
p155
aVThere had to be another piece of the jigsaw.
p156
aVAnd I realized, at the same time,
p157
aVthat it is OK to be an outsider,
p158
aVa recent arrival,
p159
aVnew on the scene \u2014
p160
aVand not just OK,
p161
aVbut something to be thankful for,
p162
aVperhaps a gift from the boat.
p163
aVBecause being an insider can so easily mean collapsing the horizons,
p164
aVcan so easily mean accepting the presumptions of your province.
p165
aVI have stepped outside my comfort zone enough now
p166
aVto know that, yes, the world does fall apart,
p167
aVbut not in the way that you fear.
p168
aa(lp169
VPossibilities that would not have been allowed
p170
aVwere outrageously encouraged.
p171
aVThere was an energy there,
p172
aVan implacable optimism,
p173
aVa strange mixture of humility and daring.
p174
aVSo I followed my hunches.
p175
aVI gathered around me a small team of people
p176
aVfor whom the label "It can't be done" was an irresistible challenge.
p177
aVFor a year, we were penniless.
p178
aVAt the end of each day, I made a huge pot of soup
p179
aVwhich we all shared.
p180
aVWe worked well into each night.
p181
aVMost of our ideas were crazy,
p182
aVbut a few were brilliant,
p183
aVand we broke through.
p184
aVI made the decision to move to the US after only one trip.
p185
aVMy hunches again.
p186
aVThree months later, I had relocated, and the adventure has continued.
p187
aa(lp188
VBefore I close, though, let me tell you about my grandmother.
p189
aVShe grew up at a time when Confucianism was the social norm
p190
aVand the local mandarin was the person who mattered.
p191
aVLife hadn't changed for centuries.
p192
aVHer father died soon after she was born.
p193
aVHer mother raised her alone.
p194
aVAt 17, she became the second wife of a mandarin whose mother beat her.
p195
aVWith no support from her husband,
p196
aVshe caused a sensation by taking him to court
p197
aVand prosecuting her own case,
p198
aVand a far greater sensation when she won.
p199
aa(lp200
V(Laughter)
p201
aa(lp202
V(Applause)
p203
aa(lp204
V"It can't be done" was shown to be wrong.
p205
aa(lp206
VI was taking a shower in a hotel room in Sydney
p207
aVthe moment she died,
p208
aV600 miles away, in Melbourne.
p209
aVI looked through the shower screen and saw her standing on the other side.
p210
aVI knew she had come to say goodbye.
p211
aVMy mother phoned minutes later.
p212
aVA few days later,
p213
aVwe went to a Buddhist temple in Footscray and sat around her casket.
p214
aVWe told her stories and assured her that we were still with her.
p215
aVAt midnight, the monk came and told us he had to close the casket.
p216
aVMy mother asked us to feel her hand.
p217
aVShe asked the monk,
p218
aV"Why is it that her hand is so warm and the rest of her is so cold?"
p219
aV"Because you have been holding it since this morning," he said.
p220
aV"You have not let it go."
p221
aa(lp222
VIf there is a sinew in our family, it runs through the women.
p223
aVGiven who we were and how life had shaped us,
p224
aVwe can now see that the men that might have come into our lives
p225
aVwould have thwarted us.
p226
aVDefeat would have come too easily.
p227
aVNow I would like to have my own children, and I wonder about the boat.
p228
aVWho could ever wish it on their own?
p229
aVYet I am afraid of privilege,
p230
aVof ease,
p231
aVof entitlement.
p232
aVCan I give them a bow in their lives, dipping bravely into each wave,
p233
aVthe unperturbed and steady beat of the engine,
p234
aVthe vast horizon that guarantees nothing?
p235
aVI don't know.
p236
aVBut if I could give it
p237
aVand still see them safely through,
p238
aVI would.
