VToday I want to confess something to you,
p4
aVbut first of all I'm going to ask you a couple of questions.
p5
aVHow many people here have children?
p6
aVAnd how many of you are confident
p7
aVthat you know how to bring up your children
p8
aVin exactly the right way?
p9
aa(lp10
V(Laughter)
p11
aa(lp12
VOK, I don't see too many hands going up on that second one,
p13
aVand that's my confession, too.
p14
aVI've got three boys;
p15
aVthey're three, nine and 12.
p16
aVAnd like you, and like most parents,
p17
aVthe honest truth is I have pretty much no idea what I'm doing.
p18
aVI want them to be happy and healthy in their lives,
p19
aVbut I don't know what I'm supposed to do
p20
aVto make sure they are happy and healthy.
p21
aVThere's so many books offering all kinds of conflicting advice,
p22
aVit can be really overwhelming.
p23
aVSo I've spent most of their lives just making it up as I go along.
p24
aVHowever, something changed me a few years ago,
p25
aVwhen I came across a little secret that we have in Britain.
p26
aVIt's helped me become more confident about how I bring up my own children,
p27
aVand it's revealed a lot about how we as a society can help all children.
p28
aVI want to share that secret with you today.
p29
aa(lp30
VFor the last 70 years,
p31
aVscientists in Britain have been following thousands of children through their lives
p32
aVas part of an incredible scientific study.
p33
aVThere's nothing quite like it anywhere else in the world.
p34
aVCollecting information on thousands of children
p35
aVis a really powerful thing to do,
p36
aVbecause it means we can compare the ones who say,
p37
aVdo well at school or end up healthy or happy or wealthy as adults,
p38
aVand the ones who struggle much more,
p39
aVand then we can sift through all the information we've collected
p40
aVand try to work out why their lives turned out different.
p41
aa(lp42
VThis British study \u2014 it's actually a kind of crazy story.
p43
aVSo it all starts back in 1946,
p44
aVjust a few months after the end of the war,
p45
aVwhen scientists wanted to know
p46
aVwhat it was like for a woman to have a baby at the time.
p47
aVThey carried out this huge survey of mothers
p48
aVand ended up recording the birth of nearly every baby
p49
aVborn in England, Scotland and Wales in one week.
p50
aVThat was nearly 14,000 babies.
p51
aVThe questions they asked these women
p52
aVare very different than the ones we might ask today.
p53
aVThey sound really old-fashioned now.
p54
aVThey asked them things like,
p55
aV"During pregnancy,
p56
aVdid you get your full extra ration of a pint of milk a day?"
p57
aV"How much did you spend on smocks, corsets,
p58
aVnightdresses, knickers and brassieres?"
p59
aVAnd this is my favorite one:
p60
aV"Who looked after your husband while you were in bed with this baby?"
p61
aa(lp62
V(Laughter)
p63
aa(lp64
VNow, this wartime study actually ended up being so successful
p65
aVthat scientists did it again.
p66
aVThey recorded the births of thousands of babies born in 1958
p67
aVand thousands more in 1970.
p68
aVThey did it again in the early 1990s,
p69
aVand again at the turn of the millennium.
p70
aVAltogether, more than 70,000 children have been involved in these studies
p71
aVacross those five generations.
p72
aVThey're called the British birth cohorts,
p73
aVand scientists have gone back and recorded more information
p74
aVon all of these people every few years ever since.
p75
aVThe amount of information that's now been collected on these people
p76
aVis just completely mind-boggling.
p77
aVIt includes thousands of paper questionnaires
p78
aVand terabytes' worth of computer data.
p79
aVScientists have also built up a huge bank of tissue samples,
p80
aVwhich includes locks of hair, nail clippings, baby teeth and DNA.
p81
aVThey've even collected 9,000 placentas from some of the births,
p82
aVwhich are now pickled in plastic buckets in a secure storage warehouse.
p83
aVThis whole project has become unique \u2014
p84
aVso, no other country in the world is tracking generations of children
p85
aVin quite this detail.
p86
aVThese are some of the best-studied people on the planet,
p87
aVand the data has become incredibly valuable for scientists,
p88
aVgenerating well over 6,000 academic papers and books.
p89
aVBut today I want to focus on just one finding \u2014
p90
aVperhaps the most important discovery to come from this remarkable study.
p91
aVAnd it's also the one that spoke to me personally,
p92
aVbecause it's about how to use science to do the best for our children.
p93
aa(lp94
VSo, let's get the bad news out of the way first.
p95
aVPerhaps the biggest message from this remarkable study is this:
p96
aVdon't be born into poverty or into disadvantage,
p97
aVbecause if you are,
p98
aVyou're far more likely to walk a difficult path in life.
p99
aVMany children in this study were born into poor families
p100
aVor into working-class families that had cramped homes or other problems,
p101
aVand it's clear now that those disadvantaged children
p102
aVhave been more likely to struggle on almost every score.
p103
aVThey've been more likely to do worse at school,
p104
aVto end up with worse jobs and to earn less money.
p105
aVNow, maybe that sounds really obvious,
p106
aVbut some of the results have been really surprising,
p107
aVso children who had a tough start in life
p108
aVare also more likely to end up unhealthy as adults.
p109
aVThey're more likely to be overweight,
p110
aVto have high blood pressure,
p111
aVand then decades down the line,
p112
aVmore likely to have a failing memory, poor health and even to die earlier.
p113
aa(lp114
VNow, I talked about what happens later,
p115
aVbut some of these differences emerge at a really shockingly early age.
p116
aVIn one study,
p117
aVchildren who were growing up in poverty
p118
aVwere almost a year behind the richer children on educational tests,
p119
aVand that was by the age of just three.
p120
aVThese types of differences have been found again and again across the generations.
p121
aVIt means that our early circumstances have a profound influence
p122
aVon the way that the rest of our lives play out.
p123
aVAnd working out why that is
p124
aVis one of the most difficult questions that we face today.
p125
aa(lp126
VSo there we have it.
p127
aVThe first lesson for successful life, everyone, is this:
p128
aVchoose your parents very carefully.
p129
aa(lp130
V(Laughter)
p131
aa(lp132
VDon't be born into a poor family or into a struggling family.
p133
aVNow, I'm sure you can see the small problem here.
p134
aVWe can't choose our parents or how much they earn,
p135
aVbut this British study has also struck a real note of optimism
p136
aVby showing that not everyone who has a disadvantaged start
p137
aVends up in difficult circumstances.
p138
aVAs you know, many people have a tough start in life,
p139
aVbut they end up doing very well on some measure nevertheless,
p140
aVand this study starts to explain how.
p141
aa(lp142
VSo the second lesson is this:
p143
aVparents really matter.
p144
aVIn this study,
p145
aVchildren who had engaged, interested parents,
p146
aVones who had ambition for their future,
p147
aVwere more likely to escape from a difficult start.
p148
aVIt seems that parents and what they do are really, really important,
p149
aVespecially in the first few years of life.
p150
aa(lp151
VLet me give you an example of that.
p152
aVIn one study,
p153
aVscientists looked at about 17,000 children who were born in 1970.
p154
aVThey sifted all the mountains of data that they had collected
p155
aVto try to work out
p156
aVwhat allowed the children who'd had a difficult start in life
p157
aVto go on and do well at school nevertheless.
p158
aVIn other words, which ones beat the odds.
p159
aVThe data showed that what mattered more than anything else was parents.
p160
aVHaving engaged, interested parents in those first few years of life
p161
aVwas strongly linked to children going on to do well at school later on.
p162
aVIn fact, quite small things that parents do
p163
aVare associated with good outcomes for children.
p164
aVTalking and listening to a child,
p165
aVresponding to them warmly,
p166
aVteaching them their letters and numbers,
p167
aVtaking them on trips and visits.
p168
aVReading to children every day seems to be really important, too.
p169
aVSo in one study,
p170
aVchildren whose parents were reading to them daily when they were five
p171
aVand then showing an interest in their education at the age of 10,
p172
aVwere significantly less likely to be in poverty at the age of 30
p173
aVthan those whose parents weren't doing those things.
p174
aa(lp175
VNow, there are huge challenges with interpreting this type of science.
p176
aVThese studies show that certain things that parents do
p177
aVare correlated with good outcomes for children,
p178
aVbut we don't necessarily know those behaviors caused the good outcomes,
p179
aVor whether some other factor is getting in the way.
p180
aVFor example, we have to take genes into account,
p181
aVand that's a whole other talk in itself.
p182
aa(lp183
VBut scientists working with this British study
p184
aVare working really hard to get at causes,
p185
aVand this is one study I particularly love.
p186
aVIn this one,
p187
aVthey looked at the bedtime routines of about 10,000 children
p188
aVborn at the turn of the millennium.
p189
aVWere the children going to bed at regular times,
p190
aVor did they go to bed at different times during the week?
p191
aVThe data showed that those children who were going to bed at different times
p192
aVwere more likely to have behavioral problems,
p193
aVand then those that switched to having regular bedtimes
p194
aVoften showed an improvement in behavior,
p195
aVand that was really crucial,
p196
aVbecause it suggested it was the bedtime routines
p197
aVthat were really helping things get better for those kids.
p198
aa(lp199
VHere's another one to think about.
p200
aVIn this one,
p201
aVscientists looked at children who were reading for pleasure.
p202
aVThat means that they picked up a magazine, a picture book, a story book.
p203
aVThe data showed that children who were reading for pleasure
p204
aVat the ages of five and 10
p205
aVwere more likely to go on in school better, on average,
p206
aVon school tests later in their lives.
p207
aVAnd not just tests of reading,
p208
aVbut tests of spelling and maths as well.
p209
aVThis study tried to control for all the confounding factors,
p210
aVso it looked at children who were equally intelligent
p211
aVand from the same social-class background,
p212
aVso it seemed as if it was the reading which really helped those children
p213
aVgo on and score better on those school tests later in their lives.
p214
aa(lp215
VNow at the start,
p216
aVI said the first lesson from this study
p217
aVwas not to be born into poverty or into disadvantage,
p218
aVbecause those children tend to follow more difficult paths in their lives.
p219
aVBut then I said that parenting matters,
p220
aVand that good parenting, if you can call it that,
p221
aVhelps children beat the odds
p222
aVand overcome some of those early disadvantages.
p223
aVSo wait,
p224
aVdoes that actually mean, then, that poverty doesn't matter after all?
p225
aVYou could argue it doesn't matter if a child is born poor \u2014
p226
aVas long as their parents are good parents, they're going to do just fine.
p227
aVI don't believe that's true.
p228
aVThis study shows that poverty and parenting matter.
p229
aVAnd one study actually put figures on that,
p230
aVso it looked at children growing up in persistent poverty
p231
aVand how well they were doing at school.
p232
aVThe data showed
p233
aVthat even when their parents were doing everything right \u2014
p234
aVputting them to bed on time
p235
aVand reading to them every day and everything else \u2014
p236
aVthat only got those children so far.
p237
aVGood parenting only reduced the educational gap
p238
aVbetween the rich and poor children by about 50 percent.
p239
aVNow that means that poverty leaves a really lasting scar,
p240
aVand it means that if we really want to ensure the success and well-being
p241
aVof the next generation,
p242
aVthen tackling child poverty is an incredibly important thing to do.
p243
aa(lp244
VNow, what does all this mean for you and me?
p245
aVAre there lessons here we can all take home and use?
p246
aVAs a scientist and a journalist,
p247
aVI like to have some science to inform my parenting ...
p248
aVand I can tell you that when you're shouting at your kids
p249
aVto go to bed on time,
p250
aVit really helps to have the scientific literature on your side.
p251
aa(lp252
V(Laughter)
p253
aa(lp254
VAnd wouldn't it be great to think
p255
aVthat all we had to do to have happy, successful children
p256
aVwas to talk to them, be interested in their future,
p257
aVput them to bed on time, and give them a book to read?
p258
aVOur job would be done.
p259
aa(lp260
VNow, as you can imagine,
p261
aVthe answers aren't quite as simple as that.
p262
aVFor one thing, this study looks at what happens
p263
aVto thousands and thousands of children on average,
p264
aVbut that doesn't necessarily say what will help my child or your child
p265
aVor any individual child.
p266
aVIn the end, each of our children is going to walk their own path,
p267
aVand that's partly defined by the genes they inherit
p268
aVand of course all the experiences they have through their lives,
p269
aVincluding their interactions with us, their parents.
p270
aa(lp271
VI will tell you what I did after I learned all this.
p272
aVIt's a bit embarrassing.
p273
aVI realized I was so busy working,
p274
aVand ironically,
p275
aVlearning and writing about this incredible study of British children,
p276
aVthat there were days when I hardly even spoke to my own British children.
p277
aVSo at home, we introduced talking time,
p278
aVwhich is just 15 minutes at the end of the day
p279
aVwhen we talk and listen to the boys.
p280
aVI try better now to ask them what they did today,
p281
aVand to show that I value what they do at school.
p282
aVOf course, I make sure they always have a book to read.
p283
aVI tell them I'm ambitious for their future,
p284
aVand I think they can be happy and do great things.
p285
aVI don't know that any of that will make a difference,
p286
aVbut I'm pretty confident it won't do them any harm,
p287
aVand it might even do them some good.
p288
aa(lp289
VUltimately, if we want happy children,
p290
aVall we can do is listen to the science,
p291
aVand of course,
p292
aVlisten to our children themselves.
p293
aa(lp294
