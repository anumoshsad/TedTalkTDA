VYou've heard of your I.Q., your general intelligence,
p4
aVbut what's your Psy-Q?
p5
aVHow much do you know about what makes you tick,
p6
aVand how good are you at predicting other people's behavior
p7
aVor even your own?
p8
aVAnd how much of what you think you know about psychology is wrong?
p9
aVLet's find out by counting down the top 10 myths of psychology.
p10
aa(lp11
VYou've probably heard it said that when it comes to their psychology,
p12
aVit's almost as if men are from Mars and women are from Venus.
p13
aVBut how different are men and women really?
p14
aVTo find out, let's start by looking at something
p15
aVon which men and women really do differ
p16
aVand plotting some psychological gender differences on the same scale.
p17
aVOne thing men and women do really differ on
p18
aVis how far they can throw a ball.
p19
aVSo if we look at the data for men here,
p20
aVwe see what is called a normal distribution curve.
p21
aVA few men can throw a ball really far, and a few men not far at all,
p22
aVbut most a kind of average distance.
p23
aVAnd women share the same distribution as well,
p24
aVbut actually there's quite a big difference.
p25
aVIn fact, the average man can throw a ball further
p26
aVthan about 98 percent of all women.
p27
aVSo now let's look at what some psychological gender differences
p28
aVlook like on the same standardized scale.
p29
aVAny psychologist will tell you
p30
aVthat men are better at spatial awareness than women \u2014
p31
aVso things like map-reading,  for example \u2014 and it's true,
p32
aVbut let's have a look at the size of this difference.
p33
aVIt's tiny; the lines are so close together they almost overlap.
p34
aVIn fact, the average woman is better than 33 percent of all men,
p35
aVand of course, if that was 50 percent,
p36
aVthen the two genders would be exactly equal.
p37
aVIt's worth bearing in mind that this difference and the next one I'll show you
p38
aVare pretty much the biggest psychological gender differences
p39
aVever discovered in psychology.
p40
aVSo here's the next one.
p41
aVAny psychologist will tell you that women are better
p42
aVwith language and grammar than men.
p43
aVSo here's performance on the standardized grammar test.
p44
aVThere go the women. There go the men.
p45
aVAgain, yes, women are better on average, but the lines are so close
p46
aVthat 33 percent of men are better than the average woman,
p47
aVand again, if it was 50 percent,
p48
aVthat would represent complete gender equality.
p49
aVSo it's not really a case of Mars and Venus.
p50
aVIt's more a case of, if anything, Mars and Snickers:
p51
aVbasically the same, but one's maybe  slightly nuttier than the other.
p52
aVI won't say which.
p53
aa(lp54
VNow we've got you warmed up.
p55
aVLet's psychoanalyze you using the famous Rorschach inkblot test.
p56
aVSo you can probably see two, I dunno, two bears or two people or something.
p57
aVBut what do you think they're doing?
p58
aVPut your hand up if you think they're saying hello.
p59
aVNot many people. Okay.
p60
aVPut your hands up if you think they are high-fiving.
p61
aVOkay. What if you think they're fighting?
p62
aVOnly a few people there.
p63
aVOkay, so if you think they're saying hello or high-fiving,
p64
aVthen that means you're a friendly person.
p65
aVIf you think they're fighting,
p66
aVyou're a bit more of a  nasty, aggressive person.
p67
aVAre you a lover or a fighter, basically.
p68
aVWhat about this one?
p69
aVThis isn't really a voting one, so on  three everyone shout out what you see.
p70
aVOne, two, three. (Audience shouting)
p71
aVI heard hamster. Who said hamster?
p72
aVThat was very worrying.
p73
aVA guy there said hamster.
p74
aVWell, you should see some kind of two-legged animal here,
p75
aVand then the mirror image of them there.
p76
aVIf you didn't, then this means that you have difficulty
p77
aVprocessing complex situations where there's a lot going on.
p78
aa(lp79
VExcept, of course, it doesn't mean that at all.
p80
aVRorschach inkblot tests have basically no validity
p81
aVwhen it comes to diagnosing people's personality
p82
aVand are not used by modern-day psychologists.
p83
aVIn fact, one recent study found that when you do try
p84
aVto diagnose people's personalities using Rorschach inkblot tests,
p85
aVschizophrenia was diagnosed
p86
aVin about one sixth of apparently perfectly normal participants.
p87
aa(lp88
VSo if you didn't do that well on this,
p89
aVmaybe you are not a very visual type of person.
p90
aVSo let's do another quick quiz to find out.
p91
aVWhen making a cake, do you prefer to \u2014 so hands up for each one again \u2014
p92
aVdo you prefer to use a recipe book with pictures?
p93
aVYeah, a few people.
p94
aVHave a friend talk you through?
p95
aVOr have a go, making it up as you go along?
p96
aVQuite a few people there.
p97
aVOkay, so if you said A,
p98
aVthen this means that you are a visual learner
p99
aVand you learn best when information is presented in a visual style.
p100
aVIf you said B, it means you're an auditory learner,
p101
aVthat you learn best when information is presented to you in an auditory format.
p102
aVAnd if you said C, it means that you're a kinesthetic learner,
p103
aVthat you learn best when you get stuck in and do things with your hands.
p104
aa(lp105
VExcept, of course, as you've probably guessed,
p106
aVthat it doesn't, because the whole thing is a complete myth.
p107
aVLearning styles are made up and are  not supported by scientific evidence.
p108
aVSo we know this because in tightly controlled experimental studies,
p109
aVwhen learners are given material to learn
p110
aVeither in their preferred style or an opposite style,
p111
aVit makes no difference at all to the amount of information that they retain.
p112
aVAnd if you think about it for just a second,
p113
aVit's just obvious that this has to be true.
p114
aVIt's obvious that the best presentation format
p115
aVdepends not on you, but on what you're trying to learn.
p116
aVCould you learn to drive a car, for example,
p117
aVjust by listening to someone telling you what to do
p118
aVwith no kinesthetic experience?
p119
aVCould you solve simultaneous equations
p120
aVby talking them through in your head and without writing them down?
p121
aVCould you revise  for your architecture exams
p122
aVusing interpretive dance if you're a kinesthetic learner?
p123
aVNo. What you need to do  is match the material to be learned
p124
aVto the presentation format, not you.
p125
aa(lp126
VI know many of you are A-level students
p127
aVthat will have recently gotten your GCSE results.
p128
aVAnd if you didn't quite get what you were hoping for,
p129
aVthen you can't really blame your learning style,
p130
aVbut one thing that you might want to think about blaming is your genes.
p131
aVSo what this is all about is a recent study at University College London
p132
aVfound that 58 percent of the variation
p133
aVbetween different students and their GCSE results
p134
aVwas down to genetic factors.
p135
aVThat sounds like a very precise figure, so how can we tell?
p136
aVWell, when we want to unpack the relative contributions
p137
aVof genes and the environment,
p138
aVwhat we can do is do a twin study.
p139
aVSo identical twins share 100 percent of their environment
p140
aVand 100 percent of their genes,
p141
aVwhereas non-identical twins share 100 percent of their environment,
p142
aVbut just like any brother and sister, share only 50 percent of their genes.
p143
aVSo by comparing how similar GCSE results are in identical twins
p144
aVversus non-identical twins,
p145
aVand doing some clever math,
p146
aVwe can an idea of how much variation and performance is due to the environment
p147
aVand how much is due to genes.
p148
aVAnd it turns out that it's about 58 percent due to genes.
p149
aVSo this isn't to undermine the hard work that you and your teachers here put in.
p150
aVIf you didn't quite get the GCSE results that you were hoping for,
p151
aVthen you can always try blaming your parents, or at least their genes.
p152
aa(lp153
VOne thing that you shouldn't blame
p154
aVis being a left-brained or right-brained learner,
p155
aVbecause again, this is a myth.
p156
aVSo the myth here is that the left brain is logical,
p157
aVit's good with equations like this,
p158
aVand the right brain is more creative, so the right brain is better at music.
p159
aVBut again, this is a myth because nearly everything that you do
p160
aVinvolves nearly all parts of your brain talking together,
p161
aVeven just the most mundane thing like having a normal conversation.
p162
aVHowever, perhaps one reason why this myth has survived
p163
aVis that there is a slight grain of truth to it.
p164
aVSo a related version of the myth
p165
aVis that left-handed people are more creative than right-handed people,
p166
aVwhich kind of makes sense because your brain controls the opposite hands,
p167
aVso left-handed people,
p168
aVthe right side of the brain is slightly more active
p169
aVthan the left-hand side of the brain,
p170
aVand the idea is the right-hand side is more creative.
p171
aVNow, it isn't true per se
p172
aVthat left-handed people are more creative than right-handed people.
p173
aVWhat is true that ambidextrous people,
p174
aVor people who use both hands for different tasks,
p175
aVare more creative thinkers than one-handed people,
p176
aVbecause being ambidextrous involves
p177
aVhaving both sides of the brain talk to each other a lot,
p178
aVwhich seems to be involved in creating flexible thinking.
p179
aVThe myth of the creative left-hander
p180
aVarises from the fact that being ambidextrous
p181
aVis more common amongst  left-handers than right-handers,
p182
aVso a grain of truth in the idea of the creative left-hander,
p183
aVbut not much.
p184
aa(lp185
VA related myth that you've probably heard of
p186
aVis that we only use 10 percent of our brains.
p187
aVThis is, again, a complete myth.
p188
aVNearly everything that we do, even the most mundane thing,
p189
aVuses nearly all of our brains.
p190
aa(lp191
VThat said, it is of course true
p192
aVthat most of us don't use our brainpower quite as well as we could.
p193
aVSo what could we do to boost our brainpower?
p194
aVMaybe we could listen to a nice bit of Mozart.
p195
aVHave you heard of the idea of the Mozart effect?
p196
aVSo the idea is that listening  to Mozart makes you smarter
p197
aVand improves your  performance on I.Q. tests.
p198
aVNow again, what's interesting about this myth
p199
aVis that although it's basically a myth, there is a grain of truth to it.
p200
aVSo the original study found that
p201
aVparticipants who were played Mozart music for a few minutes
p202
aVdid better on a subsequent I.Q. test
p203
aVthan participants who simply sat in silence.
p204
aVBut a follow-up study recruited some people who liked Mozart music
p205
aVand then another group of people
p206
aVwho were fans of  the horror stories of Stephen King.
p207
aVAnd they played the people the music or the stories.
p208
aVThe people who preferred Mozart music to the stories
p209
aVgot a bigger I.Q. boost from the Mozart than the stories,
p210
aVbut the people who preferred the stories to the Mozart music
p211
aVgot a bigger I.Q. boost from listening to the Stephen King stories
p212
aVthan the Mozart music.
p213
aVSo the truth is that listening to something that you enjoy
p214
aVperks you up a bit and gives you a temporary I.Q. boost
p215
aVon a narrow range of tasks.
p216
aVThere's no suggestion that listening to Mozart,
p217
aVor indeed Stephen King stories,
p218
aVis going to make you any smarter in the long run.
p219
aa(lp220
VAnother version of the Mozart myth
p221
aVis that listening to Mozart can make you not only cleverer but healthier, too.
p222
aVUnfortunately, this doesn't seem to be true
p223
aVof someone who listened to the music of Mozart almost every day,
p224
aVMozart himself,
p225
aVwho suffered from gonorrhea, smallpox, arthritis,
p226
aVand, what most people think eventually killed him in the end, syphilis.
p227
aVThis suggests that Mozart should have bit more careful, perhaps,
p228
aVwhen choosing his sexual partners.
p229
aVBut how do we choose a partner?
p230
aa(lp231
VSo a myth that I have to say is sometimes spread a bit by sociologists
p232
aVis that our preferences in a romantic  partner are a product of our culture,
p233
aVthat they're very culturally specific.
p234
aVBut in fact, the data don't back this up.
p235
aVA famous study surveyed people from [37] different cultures across the globe,
p236
aVfrom Americans to Zulus,
p237
aVon what they look for in a partner.
p238
aVAnd in every single culture across the globe,
p239
aVmen placed more value on physical attractiveness in a partner
p240
aVthan did women,
p241
aVand in every single culture, too,
p242
aVwomen placed more importance than did men on ambition and high earning power.
p243
aVIn every culture, too,
p244
aVmen preferred women who were younger than themselves,
p245
aVan average of, I think it was 2.66 years,
p246
aVand in every culture, too,
p247
aVwomen preferred men who were older than them,
p248
aVso an average of 3.42 years,
p249
aVwhich is why we've got here "Everybody needs a Sugar Daddy."
p250
aa(lp251
VSo moving on from trying to score with a partner
p252
aVto trying to score in basketball or football or whatever your sport is.
p253
aVThe myth here is that sportsmen go through hot-hand streaks, Americans call them,
p254
aVor purple patches, we sometimes say in England,
p255
aVwhere they just can't miss, like this guy here.
p256
aVBut in fact, what happens is that if you analyze the pattern
p257
aVof hits and misses statistically,
p258
aVit turns out that it's nearly always at random.
p259
aVYour brain creates patterns from the randomness.
p260
aVIf you toss a coin,
p261
aVa streak of heads or tails is going  to come out somewhere in the randomness,
p262
aVand because the brain likes to see patterns where there are none,
p263
aVwe look at these streaks and attribute meanings to them
p264
aVand say, "Yeah he's really on form today,"
p265
aVwhereas actually you would get the same pattern
p266
aVif you were just getting hits and misses at random.
p267
aa(lp268
VSo an exception to this, however, is penalty shootouts.
p269
aVA recent study looking at penalty shootouts in football
p270
aVshows that players who represent countries
p271
aVwith a very bad record in penalty shootouts,
p272
aVlike, for example, England,
p273
aVtend to be quicker to take their shots than countries with a better record,
p274
aVand presumably as a result, they're more likely to miss.
p275
aa(lp276
VWhich raises the question
p277
aVof if there's any way that we could improve people's performance.
p278
aVAnd one thing you might think about doing
p279
aVis punishing people for their misses and seeing if that improves them.
p280
aVThis idea, the effect that punishment can improve performance,
p281
aVis what participants thought they were testing
p282
aVin Milgram's famous learning and punishment experiment
p283
aVthat you've probably heard about if you're a psychology student.
p284
aVThe story goes that participants were prepared to give
p285
aVwhat they believed to be fatal electric shocks to a fellow participant
p286
aVwhen they got a question wrong,
p287
aVjust because someone in a white coat told them to.
p288
aa(lp289
VBut this story is a myth for three reasons.
p290
aVFirstly and most crucially, the lab coat wasn't white, it was in fact grey.
p291
aVSecondly, the participants were told before the study
p292
aVand reminded any time they raised a concern,
p293
aVthat although the shocks were painful, they were not fatal
p294
aVand indeed caused no permanent damage whatsoever.
p295
aVAnd thirdly, participants didn't give the shocks
p296
aVjust because someone in the coat told them to.
p297
aVWhen they were interviewed after the study,
p298
aVall the participants said that they firmly believed
p299
aVthat the learning and punishment study served a worthy scientific purpose
p300
aVwhich would have enduring gains for science
p301
aVas opposed to the momentary nonfatal discomfort caused to the participants.
p302
aa(lp303
VOkay, so I've been talking for about 12 minutes now,
p304
aVand you've probably been  sitting there listening to me,
p305
aVanalyzing my speech patterns  and body language
p306
aVand trying to work out if you should take any notice of what I'm saying,
p307
aVwhether I'm telling the truth or whether I'm lying,
p308
aVbut if so you've probably completely failed,
p309
aVbecause although we all think we can catch a liar
p310
aVfrom their body language and speech patterns,
p311
aVhundreds of psychological tests over the years have shown
p312
aVthat all of us, including police officers and detectives,
p313
aVare basically at chance when it comes to detecting lies from body language
p314
aVand verbal patterns.
p315
aVInterestingly, there is one exception:
p316
aVTV appeals for missing relatives.
p317
aVIt's quite easy to predict when the relatives are missing
p318
aVand when the appealers have in fact murdered the relatives themselves.
p319
aVSo hoax appealers are more likely to shake their heads, to look away,
p320
aVand to make errors in their speech,
p321
aVwhereas genuine appealers are more likely
p322
aVto express hope that the person will return safely
p323
aVand to avoid brutal language.
p324
aVSo, for example, they might say "taken from us" rather than "killed."
p325
aa(lp326
VSpeaking of which, it's about time I killed this talk,
p327
aVbut before I do, I just want  to give you in 30 seconds
p328
aVthe overarching myth of psychology.
p329
aVSo the myth is that psychology is just a collection of interesting theories,
p330
aVall of which say something useful and all of which have something to offer.
p331
aVWhat I hope to have shown you in the past few minutes
p332
aVis that this isn't true.
p333
aVWhat we need to do is assess psychological theories
p334
aVby seeing what predictions they make,
p335
aVwhether that is that listening to Mozart makes you smarter,
p336
aVthat you learn better when information is presented in your preferred learning style
p337
aVor whatever it is, all of these are testable empirical predictions,
p338
aVand the only way we can make progress
p339
aVis to test these predictions against the data
p340
aVin tightly controlled experimental studies.
p341
aVAnd it's only by doing so that we can hope to discover
p342
aVwhich of these theories are well supported,
p343
aVand which, like all the ones I've told you about today, are myths.
