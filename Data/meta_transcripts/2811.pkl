V"These are the times,"
p4
aVsaid Thomas Paine,
p5
aV"that try men's souls."
p6
aVAnd they're trying ours now.
p7
aa(lp8
VThis is a fateful moment in the history of the West.
p9
aVWe've seen divisive elections and divided societies.
p10
aVWe've seen a growth of extremism
p11
aVin politics and religion,
p12
aVall of it fueled by anxiety, uncertainty and fear,
p13
aVof a world that's changing almost faster than we can bear,
p14
aVand the sure knowledge that it's going to change faster still.
p15
aVI have a friend in Washington.
p16
aVI asked him, what was it like being in America
p17
aVduring the recent presidential election?
p18
aVHe said to me, "Well,
p19
aVit was like the man
p20
aVsitting on the deck of the Titanic
p21
aVwith a glass of whiskey in his hand
p22
aVand he's saying, 'I know I asked for ice \u2014
p23
aa(lp24
V(Laughter)
p25
aa(lp26
Vbut this is ridiculous.'"
p27
aa(lp28
VSo is there something we can do,
p29
aVeach of us,
p30
aVto be able to face the future without fear?
p31
aVI think there is.
p32
aVAnd one way into it is to see
p33
aVthat perhaps the most simple way into a culture and into an age
p34
aVis to ask: What do people worship?
p35
aVPeople have worshipped so many different things \u2014
p36
aVthe sun, the stars, the storm.
p37
aVSome people worship many gods, some one, some none.
p38
aVIn the 19th and 20th centuries,
p39
aVpeople worshipped the nation,
p40
aVthe Aryan race, the communist state.
p41
aVWhat do we worship?
p42
aVI think future anthropologists
p43
aVwill take a look at the books we read
p44
aVon self-help, self-realization,
p45
aVself-esteem.
p46
aVThey'll look at the way we talk about morality
p47
aVas being true to oneself,
p48
aVthe way we talk about politics
p49
aVas a matter of individual rights,
p50
aVand they'll look at this wonderful new religious ritual we have created.
p51
aVYou know the one?
p52
aVCalled the "selfie."
p53
aVAnd I think they'll conclude that what we worship in our time
p54
aVis the self, the me, the I.
p55
aa(lp56
VAnd this is great.
p57
aVIt's liberating. It's empowering. It's wonderful.
p58
aVBut don't forget that biologically, we're social animals.
p59
aVWe've spent most of our evolutionary history
p60
aVin small groups.
p61
aVWe need those face-to-face interactions
p62
aVwhere we learn the choreography of altruism
p63
aVand where we create those spiritual goods
p64
aVlike friendship and trust and loyalty and love
p65
aVthat redeem our solitude.
p66
aVWhen we have too much of the "I" and too little of the "we,"
p67
aVwe can find ourselves vulnerable,
p68
aVfearful and alone.
p69
aVIt was no accident that Sherry Turkle of MIT
p70
aVcalled the book she wrote on the impact of social media
p71
aV"Alone Together."
p72
aa(lp73
VSo I think the simplest way of safeguarding the future "you"
p74
aVis to strengthen the future "us"
p75
aVin three dimensions:
p76
aVthe us of relationship,
p77
aVthe us of identity
p78
aVand the us of responsibility.
p79
aa(lp80
VSo let me first take the us of relationship.
p81
aVAnd here, forgive me if I get personal.
p82
aVOnce upon a time,
p83
aVa very long time ago,
p84
aVI was a 20-year-old undergraduate
p85
aVstudying philosophy.
p86
aVI was into Nietzsche and Schopenhauer and Sartre and Camus.
p87
aVI was full of ontological uncertainty
p88
aVand existential angst.
p89
aVIt was terrific.
p90
aa(lp91
V(Laughter)
p92
aa(lp93
VI was self-obsessed and thoroughly unpleasant to know,
p94
aVuntil one day I saw
p95
aVacross the courtyard
p96
aVa girl
p97
aVwho was everything that I wasn't.
p98
aVShe radiated sunshine.
p99
aVShe emanated joy.
p100
aVI found out her name was Elaine.
p101
aVWe met. We talked.
p102
aVWe married.
p103
aVAnd 47 years, three children and eight grandchildren later,
p104
aVI can safely say
p105
aVit was the best decision I ever took in my life,
p106
aVbecause it's the people not like us
p107
aVthat make us grow.
p108
aVAnd that is why I think
p109
aVwe have to do just that.
p110
aa(lp111
VThe trouble with Google filters,
p112
aVFacebook friends
p113
aVand reading the news by narrowcasting rather than broadcasting
p114
aVmeans that we're surrounded almost entirely by people like us
p115
aVwhose views, whose opinions, whose prejudices, even,
p116
aVare just like ours.
p117
aVAnd Cass Sunstein of Harvard has shown
p118
aVthat if we surround ourselves with people with the same views as us,
p119
aVwe get more extreme.
p120
aVI think we need to renew those face-to-face encounters
p121
aVwith the people not like us.
p122
aVI think we need to do that
p123
aVin order to realize that we can disagree strongly
p124
aVand yet still stay friends.
p125
aVIt's in those face-to-face encounters
p126
aVthat we discover that the people not like us
p127
aVare just people, like us.
p128
aVAnd actually, every time
p129
aVwe hold out the hand of friendship
p130
aVto somebody not like us,
p131
aVwhose class or creed or color are different from ours,
p132
aVwe heal
p133
aVone of the fractures
p134
aVof our wounded world.
p135
aVThat is the us of relationship.
p136
aa(lp137
VSecond is the us of identity.
p138
aVLet me give you a thought experiment.
p139
aVHave you been to Washington? Have you seen the memorials?
p140
aVAbsolutely fascinating.
p141
aVThere's the Lincoln Memorial:
p142
aVGettysburg Address on one side, Second Inaugural on the other.
p143
aVYou go to the Jefferson Memorial,
p144
aVscreeds of text.
p145
aVMartin Luther King Memorial,
p146
aVmore than a dozen quotes from his speeches.
p147
aVI didn't realize, in America you read memorials.
p148
aVNow go to the equivalent in London in Parliament Square
p149
aVand you will see that the monument to David Lloyd George
p150
aVcontains three words:
p151
aVDavid Lloyd George.
p152
aa(lp153
V(Laughter)
p154
aa(lp155
VNelson Mandela gets two.
p156
aVChurchill gets just one:
p157
aVChurchill.
p158
aa(lp159
V(Laughter)
p160
aa(lp161
VWhy the difference? I'll tell you why the difference.
p162
aVBecause America was from the outset a nation of wave after wave of immigrants,
p163
aVso it had to create an identity
p164
aVwhich it did by telling a story
p165
aVwhich you learned at school, you read on memorials
p166
aVand you heard repeated in presidential inaugural addresses.
p167
aVBritain until recently wasn't a nation of immigrants,
p168
aVso it could take identity for granted.
p169
aVThe trouble is now
p170
aVthat two things have happened which shouldn't have happened together.
p171
aVThe first thing is in the West we've stopped telling this story
p172
aVof who we are and why,
p173
aVeven in America.
p174
aVAnd at the same time,
p175
aVimmigration is higher than it's ever been before.
p176
aVSo when you tell a story and your identity is strong,
p177
aVyou can welcome the stranger,
p178
aVbut when you stop telling the story,
p179
aVyour identity gets weak
p180
aVand you feel threatened by the stranger.
p181
aVAnd that's bad.
p182
aa(lp183
VI tell you, Jews have been scattered and dispersed and exiled for 2,000 years.
p184
aVWe never lost our identity.
p185
aVWhy? Because at least once a year,
p186
aVon the festival of Passover,
p187
aVwe told our story and we taught it to our children
p188
aVand we ate the unleavened bread of affliction
p189
aVand tasted the bitter herbs of slavery.
p190
aVSo we never lost our identity.
p191
aVI think collectively
p192
aVwe've got to get back to telling our story,
p193
aVwho we are, where we came from,
p194
aVwhat ideals by which we live.
p195
aVAnd if that happens,
p196
aVwe will become strong enough
p197
aVto welcome the stranger and say,
p198
aV"Come and share our lives,
p199
aVshare our stories,
p200
aVshare our aspirations and dreams."
p201
aVThat is the us of identity.
p202
aa(lp203
VAnd finally, the us of responsibility.
p204
aVDo you know something?
p205
aVMy favorite phrase in all of politics,
p206
aVvery American phrase,
p207
aVis: "We the people."
p208
aVWhy "we the people?"
p209
aVBecause it says that we all share collective responsibility
p210
aVfor our collective future.
p211
aVAnd that's how things really are and should be.
p212
aa(lp213
VHave you noticed how magical thinking
p214
aVhas taken over our politics?
p215
aVSo we say, all you've got to do is elect this strong leader
p216
aVand he or she will solve all our problems for us.
p217
aVBelieve me, that is magical thinking.
p218
aVAnd then we get the extremes:
p219
aVthe far right, the far left,
p220
aVthe extreme religious and the extreme anti-religious,
p221
aVthe far right dreaming of a golden age that never was,
p222
aVthe far left dreaming of a utopia that never will be
p223
aVand the religious and anti-religious equally convinced
p224
aVthat all it takes is God or the absence of God
p225
aVto save us from ourselves.
p226
aVThat, too, is magical thinking,
p227
aVbecause the only people who will save us from ourselves
p228
aVis we the people,
p229
aVall of us together.
p230
aVAnd when we do that,
p231
aVand when we move from the politics of me
p232
aVto the politics of all of us together,
p233
aVwe rediscover those beautiful, counterintuitive truths:
p234
aVthat a nation is strong
p235
aVwhen it cares for the weak,
p236
aVthat it becomes rich
p237
aVwhen it cares for the poor,
p238
aVit becomes invulnerable when it cares about the vulnerable.
p239
aVThat is what makes great nations.
p240
aa(lp241
V(Applause)
p242
aa(lp243
VSo here is my simple suggestion.
p244
aVIt might just change your life,
p245
aVand it might just help to begin to change the world.
p246
aVDo a search and replace operation
p247
aVon the text of your mind,
p248
aVand wherever you encounter the word "self,"
p249
aVsubstitute the word "other."
p250
aVSo instead of self-help, other-help;
p251
aVinstead of self-esteem, other-esteem.
p252
aVAnd if you do that,
p253
aVyou will begin to feel the power
p254
aVof what for me is one of the most moving sentences
p255
aVin all of religious literature.
p256
aV"Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
p257
aVI will fear no evil,
p258
aVfor you are with me."
p259
aVWe can face any future without fear
p260
aVso long as we know
p261
aVwe will not face it alone.
p262
aa(lp263
VSo for the sake of the future "you,"
p264
aVtogether let us strengthen
p265
aVthe future "us."
p266
aa(lp267
VThank you.
