VBeau Lotto: So, this game is very simple.
p4
aVAll you have to do is read what you see. Right?
p5
aVSo, I'm going to count to you, so we don't all do it together.
p6
aa(lp7
VOkay, one, two, three.Audience: Can you read this?
p8
aa(lp9
VBL: Amazing. What about this one? One, two, three.Audience: You are not reading this.
p10
aa(lp11
VBL: All right. One, two, three. (Laughter)
p12
aVIf you were Portuguese, right? How about this one? One, two, three.
p13
aa(lp14
VAudience: What are you reading?
p15
aa(lp16
VBL: What are you reading? There are no words there.
p17
aVI said, read what you're seeing. Right?
p18
aVIt literally says, "Wat ar ou rea in?" (Laughter) Right?
p19
aVThat's what you should have said. Right? Why is this?
p20
aa(lp21
VIt's because perception is grounded in our experience.
p22
aVRight? The brain takes meaningless information
p23
aVand makes meaning out of it, which means we never see
p24
aVwhat's there, we never see information,
p25
aVwe only ever see what was useful to see in the past.
p26
aVAll right? Which means, when it comes to perception,
p27
aVwe're all like this frog.
p28
aV(Laughter)
p29
aVRight? It's getting information. It's generating behavior
p30
aVthat's useful. (Laughter)
p31
aV(Laughter)
p32
aa(lp33
V(Video) Man: Ow! Ow! (Laughter) (Applause)
p34
aa(lp35
VBL: And sometimes, when things don't go our way,
p36
aVwe get a little bit annoyed, right?
p37
aVBut we're talking about perception here, right?
p38
aVAnd perception underpins everything we think, we know,
p39
aVwe believe, our hopes, our dreams, the clothes we wear,
p40
aVfalling in love, everything begins with perception.
p41
aVNow if perception is grounded in our history, it means
p42
aVwe're only ever responding according to what we've done before.
p43
aVBut actually, it's a tremendous problem,
p44
aVbecause how can we ever see differently?
p45
aa(lp46
VNow, I want to tell you a story about seeing differently,
p47
aVand all new perceptions begin in the same way.
p48
aVThey begin with a question.
p49
aVThe problem with questions is they create uncertainty.
p50
aVNow, uncertainty is a very bad thing. It's evolutionarily
p51
aVa bad thing. If you're not sure that's a predator, it's too late.
p52
aVOkay? (Laughter)
p53
aVEven seasickness is a consequence of uncertainty.
p54
aVRight? If you go down below on a boat, your inner ears
p55
aVare you telling you you're moving. Your eyes, because
p56
aVit's moving in register with the boat, say I'm standing still.
p57
aVYour brain cannot deal with the uncertainty of that information, and it gets ill.
p58
aVThe question "why?" is one of the most dangerous things you can do,
p59
aVbecause it takes you into uncertainty.
p60
aVAnd yet, the irony is, the only way we can ever
p61
aVdo anything new is to step into that space.
p62
aVSo how can we ever do anything new? Well fortunately,
p63
aVevolution has given us an answer, right?
p64
aVAnd it enables us to address even the most difficult
p65
aVof questions. The best questions are the ones that create the most uncertainty.
p66
aVThey're the ones that question the things we think to be true already. Right?
p67
aVIt's easy to ask questions about how did life begin,
p68
aVor what extends beyond the universe, but to question what you think to be true already
p69
aVis really stepping into that space.
p70
aa(lp71
VSo what is evolution's answer to the problem of uncertainty?
p72
aVIt's play.
p73
aVNow play is not simply a process. Experts in play will tell you
p74
aVthat actually it's a way of being.
p75
aVPlay is one of the only human endeavors where uncertainty
p76
aVis actually celebrated. Uncertainty is what makes play fun.
p77
aVRight? It's adaptable to change. Right? It opens possibility,
p78
aVand it's cooperative. It's actually how we do our social bonding,
p79
aVand it's intrinsically motivated. What that means
p80
aVis that we play to play. Play is its own reward.
p81
aa(lp82
VNow if you look at these five ways of being,
p83
aVthese are the exact same ways of being you need
p84
aVin order to be a good scientist.
p85
aVScience is not defined by the method section of a paper.
p86
aVIt's actually a way of being, which is here, and this is true
p87
aVfor anything that is creative.
p88
aVSo if you add rules to play, you have a game.
p89
aVThat's actually what an experiment is.
p90
aa(lp91
VSo armed with these two ideas,
p92
aVthat science is a way of being and experiments are play,
p93
aVwe asked, can anyone become a scientist?
p94
aVAnd who better to ask than 25 eight- to 10-year-old children?
p95
aVBecause they're experts in play. So I took my bee arena
p96
aVdown to a small school in Devon, and the aim of this
p97
aVwas to not just get the kids to see science differently,
p98
aVbut, through the process of science, to see themselves differently. Right?
p99
aa(lp100
VThe first step was to ask a question.
p101
aa(lp102
VNow, I should say that we didn't get funding for this study
p103
aVbecause the scientists said small children couldn't make
p104
aVa useful contribution to science, and the teachers said kids couldn't do it.
p105
aVSo we did it anyway. Right? Of course.
p106
aa(lp107
VSo, here are some of the questions. I put them in small print
p108
aVso you wouldn't bother reading it. Point is that five of the questions that the kids came up with
p109
aVwere actually the basis of science publication the last five to 15 years. Right?
p110
aVSo they were asking questions that were significant
p111
aVto expert scientists.
p112
aa(lp113
VNow here, I want to share the stage with someone quite special. Right?
p114
aVShe was one of the young people who was involved in this study,
p115
aVand she's now one of the youngest published scientists
p116
aVin the world. Right? She will now, once she comes onto stage,
p117
aVwill be the youngest person to ever speak at TED. Right?
p118
aVNow, science and asking questions is about courage.
p119
aVNow she is the personification of courage, because she's
p120
aVgoing to stand up here and talk to you all.
p121
aVSo Amy, would you please come up? (Applause)
p122
aV(Applause)
p123
aVSo Amy's going to help me tell the story of what we call
p124
aVthe Blackawton Bees Project, and first she's going to tell you
p125
aVthe question that they came up with. So go ahead, Amy.
p126
aa(lp127
VAmy O'Toole: Thank you, Beau. We thought
p128
aVthat it was easy to see the link between humans and apes
p129
aVin the way that we think, because we look alike.
p130
aVBut we wondered if there's a possible link
p131
aVwith other animals. It'd be amazing if humans and bees
p132
aVthought similar, since they seem so different from us.
p133
aVSo we asked if humans and bees might solve
p134
aVcomplex problems in the same way.
p135
aVReally, we wanted to know if bees can also adapt
p136
aVthemselves to new situations using previously learned rules
p137
aVand conditions. So what if bees can think like us?
p138
aVWell, it'd be amazing, since we're talking about an insect
p139
aVwith only one million brain cells.
p140
aVBut it actually makes a lot of sense they should,
p141
aVbecause bees, like us, can recognize a good flower
p142
aVregardless of the time of day, the light, the weather,
p143
aVor from any angle they approach it from. (Applause)
p144
aa(lp145
VBL: So the next step was to design an experiment,
p146
aVwhich is a game. So the kids went off and they designed
p147
aVthis experiment, and so \u2014 well, game \u2014 and so,
p148
aVAmy, can you tell us what the game was,
p149
aVand the puzzle that you set the bees?
p150
aa(lp151
VAO: The puzzle we came up with was an if-then rule.
p152
aVWe asked the bees to learn not just to go to a certain color,
p153
aVbut to a certain color flower only
p154
aVwhen it's in a certain pattern.
p155
aVThey were only rewarded if they went to the yellow flowers
p156
aVif the yellow flowers were surrounded by the blue,
p157
aVor if the blue flowers were surrounded by the yellow.
p158
aVNow there's a number of different rules the bees can learn
p159
aVto solve this puzzle. The interesting question is, which?
p160
aVWhat was really exciting about this project was we,
p161
aVand Beau, had no idea whether it would work.
p162
aVIt was completely new, and no one had done it before,
p163
aVincluding adults. (Laughter)
p164
aa(lp165
VBL: Including the teachers, and that was really hard for the teachers.
p166
aVIt's easy for a scientist to go in and not have a clue what he's doing,
p167
aVbecause that's what we do in the lab, but for a teacher
p168
aVnot to know what's going to happen at the end of the day \u2014
p169
aVso much of the credit goes to Dave Strudwick, who was
p170
aVthe collaborator on this project. Okay?
p171
aVSo I'm not going to go through the whole details of the study
p172
aVbecause actually you can read about it, but the next step
p173
aVis observation. So here are some of the students
p174
aVdoing the observations. They're recording the data
p175
aVof where the bees fly.
p176
aa(lp177
V(Video) Dave Strudwick: So what we're going to do \u2014Student: 5C.
p178
aa(lp179
VDave Strudwick: Is she still going up here?Student: Yeah.
p180
aa(lp181
VDave Strudwick: So you keep track of each.Student: Henry, can you help me here?
p182
aa(lp183
VBL: "Can you help me, Henry?" What good scientist says that, right?
p184
aa(lp185
VStudent: There's two up there.
p186
aVAnd three in here.
p187
aa(lp188
VBL: Right? So we've got our observations. We've got our data.
p189
aVThey do the simple mathematics, averaging, etc., etc.
p190
aVAnd now we want to share. That's the next step.
p191
aVSo we're going to write this up and try to submit this
p192
aVfor publication. Right? So we have to write it up.
p193
aVSo we go, of course, to the pub. All right? (Laughter)
p194
aVThe one on the left is mine, okay? (Laughter)
p195
aa(lp196
VNow, I tell them, a paper has four different sections:
p197
aVan introduction, a methods, a results, a discussion.
p198
aVThe introduction says, what's the question and why?
p199
aVMethods, what did you do? Results, what was the observation?
p200
aVAnd the discussion is, who cares? Right?
p201
aVThat's a science paper, basically. (Laughter)
p202
aa(lp203
VSo the kids give me the words, right? I put it into a narrative,
p204
aVwhich means that this paper is written in kidspeak.
p205
aVIt's not written by me. It's written by Amy
p206
aVand the other students in the class. As a consequence,
p207
aVthis science paper begins, "Once upon a time ... " (Laughter)
p208
aVThe results section, it says: "Training phase, the puzzle ... duh duh duuuuuhhh." Right? (Laughter)
p209
aVAnd the methods, it says, "Then we put the bees
p210
aVinto the fridge (and made bee pie)," smiley face. Right? (Laughter)
p211
aVThis is a science paper. We're going to try to get it published.
p212
aVSo here's the title page. We have a number of authors there.
p213
aVAll the ones in bold are eight to 10 years old.
p214
aVThe first author is Blackawton Primary School, because
p215
aVif it were ever referenced, it would be "Blackawton et al,"
p216
aVand not one individual. So we submit it to a public access journal,
p217
aVand it says this. It said many things, but it said this.
p218
aV"I'm afraid the paper fails our initial quality control checks in several different ways." (Laughter)
p219
aVIn other words, it starts off "once upon a time,"
p220
aVthe figures are in crayon, etc. (Laughter)
p221
aa(lp222
VSo we said, we'll get it reviewed. So I sent it to Dale Purves,
p223
aVwho is at the National Academy of Science, one of the leading neuroscientists in the world,
p224
aVand he says, "This is the most original science paper I have ever read" \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p225
aV"and it certainly deserves wide exposure."
p226
aVLarry Maloney, expert in vision, says, "The paper is magnificent.
p227
aVThe work would be publishable if done by adults."
p228
aa(lp229
VSo what did we do? We send it back to the editor.
p230
aVThey say no.
p231
aVSo we asked Larry and Natalie Hempel to write
p232
aVa commentary situating the findings for scientists, right,
p233
aVputting in the references, and we submit it to Biology Letters.
p234
aVAnd there, it was reviewed by five independent referees,
p235
aVand it was published. Okay? (Applause)
p236
aV(Applause)
p237
aa(lp238
VIt took four months to do the science,
p239
aVtwo years to get it published. (Laughter)
p240
aVTypical science, actually, right? So this makes Amy and
p241
aVher friends the youngest published scientists in the world.
p242
aVWhat was the feedback like?
p243
aVWell, it was published two days before Christmas,
p244
aVdownloaded 30,000 times in the first day, right?
p245
aVIt was the Editors' Choice in Science, which is a top science magazine.
p246
aVIt's forever freely accessible by Biology Letters.
p247
aVIt's the only paper that will ever be freely accessible by this journal.
p248
aVLast year, it was the second-most downloaded paper
p249
aVby Biology Letters, and the feedback from not just scientists
p250
aVand teachers but the public as well.
p251
aVAnd I'll just read one.
p252
aa(lp253
V"I have read 'Blackawton Bees' recently. I don't have
p254
aVwords to explain exactly how I am feeling right now.
p255
aVWhat you guys have done is real, true and amazing.
p256
aVCuriosity, interest, innocence and zeal are the most basic
p257
aVand most important things to do science.
p258
aVWho else can have these qualities more than children?
p259
aVPlease congratulate your children's team from my side."
p260
aa(lp261
VSo I'd like to conclude with a physical metaphor.
p262
aVCan I do it on you? (Laughter)
p263
aVOh yeah, yeah, yeah, come on. Yeah yeah. Okay.
p264
aVNow, science is about taking risks, so this is an incredible risk, right? (Laughter)
p265
aVFor me, not for him. Right? Because we've only done this once before. (Laughter)
p266
aVAnd you like technology, right?
p267
aa(lp268
VShimon Schocken: Right, but I like myself.
p269
aa(lp270
VBL: This is the epitome of technology. Right. Okay.
p271
aVNow ... (Laughter)
p272
aVOkay. (Laughter)
p273
aa(lp274
VNow, we're going to do a little demonstration, right?
p275
aVYou have to close your eyes, and you have to point
p276
aVwhere you hear me clapping. All right?
p277
aa(lp278
V(Clapping)
p279
aa(lp280
V(Clapping)
p281
aa(lp282
VOkay, how about if everyone over there shouts. One, two, three?
p283
aa(lp284
VAudience: (Shouts)
p285
aV(Laughter)
p286
aa(lp287
V(Shouts) (Laughter)
p288
aa(lp289
VBrilliant. Now, open your eyes. We'll do it one more time.
p290
aVEveryone over there shout. (Shouts)
p291
aVWhere's the sound coming from? (Laughter) (Applause)
p292
aa(lp293
VThank you very much. (Applause)
p294
aa(lp295
VWhat's the point? The point is what science does for us.
p296
aVRight? We normally walk through life responding,
p297
aVbut if we ever want to do anything different, we have to
p298
aVstep into uncertainty. When he opened his eyes,
p299
aVhe was able to see the world in a new way.
p300
aVThat's what science offers us. It offers the possibility
p301
aVto step on uncertainty through the process of play, right?
p302
aa(lp303
VNow, true science education I think should be about
p304
aVgiving people a voice and enabling to express that voice,
p305
aVso I've asked Amy to be the last voice in this short story.
p306
aVSo, Amy?
p307
aa(lp308
VAO: This project was really exciting for me,
p309
aVbecause it brought the process of discovery to life,
p310
aVand it showed me that anyone, and I mean anyone,
p311
aVhas the potential to discover something new,
p312
aVand that a small question can lead into a big discovery.
p313
aVChanging the way a person thinks about something
p314
aVcan be easy or hard. It all depends on the way the person
p315
aVfeels about change.
p316
aVBut changing the way I thought about science was
p317
aVsurprisingly easy. Once we played the games
p318
aVand then started to think about the puzzle,
p319
aVI then realized that science isn't just a boring subject,
p320
aVand that anyone can discover something new.
p321
aVYou just need an opportunity. My opportunity came
p322
aVin the form of Beau, and the Blackawton Bee Project.
p323
aa(lp324
VThank you.BL: Thank you very much. (Applause)
