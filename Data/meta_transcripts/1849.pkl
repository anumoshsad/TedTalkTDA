aa(lp5
VYuyu Rau: Hi, I'm Hetain. I'm an artist.
p6
aVAnd this is Yuyu,
p7
aVwho is a dancer I have been working with.
p8
aVI have asked her to translate for me.
p9
aa(lp10
VHP: (In Chinese)
p11
aa(lp12
VYR: If I may, I would like to tell you
p13
aVa little bit about myself
p14
aVand my artwork.
p15
aa(lp16
VHP: (In Chinese)
p17
aa(lp18
VYR: I was born and raised near Manchester,
p19
aVin England,
p20
aVbut I'm not going to say it in English to you,
p21
aVbecause I'm trying to avoid any assumptions
p22
aVthat might be made from my northern accent.
p23
aa(lp24
V(Laughter)
p25
aa(lp26
VHP: (In Chinese)
p27
aa(lp28
VYR: The only problem with masking it
p29
aVwith Chinese Mandarin
p30
aVis I can only speak this paragraph,
p31
aVwhich I have learned by heart
p32
aVwhen I was visiting in China. (Laughter)
p33
aVSo all I can do is keep repeating it in different tones
p34
aVand hope you won't notice.
p35
aa(lp36
V(Laughter)
p37
aa(lp38
VHP: (In Chinese)
p39
aa(lp40
V(Laughter)
p41
aa(lp42
VYR: Needless to say, I would like to apologize
p43
aVto any Mandarin speakers in the audience.
p44
aa(lp45
VAs a child, I would hate being made
p46
aVto wear the Indian kurta pajama,
p47
aVbecause I didn't think it was very cool.
p48
aVIt felt a bit girly to me, like a dress,
p49
aVand it had this baggy trouser part
p50
aVyou had to tie really tight
p51
aVto avoid the embarrassment of them falling down.
p52
aVMy dad never wore it,
p53
aVso I didn't see why I had to.
p54
aVAlso, it makes me feel a bit uncomfortable,
p55
aVthat people assume I represent something
p56
aVgenuinely Indian when I wear it,
p57
aVbecause that's not how I feel.
p58
aa(lp59
VHP: (In Chinese)
p60
aa(lp61
VYR: Actually, the only way I feel comfortable
p62
aVwearing it is by pretending
p63
aVthey are the robes of a kung fu warrior
p64
aVlike Li Mu Bai from that film,
p65
aV"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."
p66
aa(lp67
V(Music)
p68
aa(lp69
VOkay.
p70
aVSo my artwork is about identity and language,
p71
aVchallenging common assumptions
p72
aVbased on how we look like or where we come from,
p73
aVgender, race, class.
p74
aVWhat makes us who we are anyway?
p75
aa(lp76
VHP: (In Chinese)
p77
aa(lp78
VYR: I used to read Spider-Man comics,
p79
aVwatch kung fu movies,
p80
aVtake philosophy lessons from Bruce Lee.
p81
aVHe would say things like \u2014
p82
aa(lp83
VHP: Empty your mind.
p84
aV(Laughter)
p85
aVBe formless, shapeless, like water.
p86
aVNow you put water into a cup.
p87
aVIt becomes the cup.
p88
aVYou put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle.
p89
aVPut it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot.
p90
aVNow, water can flow
p91
aVor it can crash.
p92
aVBe water, my friend. (Applause)
p93
aa(lp94
VYR: This year, I am 32 years old,
p95
aVthe same age Bruce Lee was when he died.
p96
aVI have been wondering recently,
p97
aVif he were alive today,
p98
aVwhat advice he would give me
p99
aVabout making this TED Talk.
p100
aa(lp101
VHP: Don't imitate my voice.
p102
aVIt offends me.
p103
aa(lp104
V(Laughter)
p105
aa(lp106
VYR: Good advice,
p107
aVbut I still think that we learn who we are
p108
aVby copying others.
p109
aVWho here hasn't imitated their childhood hero
p110
aVin the playground, or mum or father?
p111
aVI have.
p112
aa(lp113
VHP: A few years ago, in order to make this video
p114
aVfor my artwork, I shaved off all my hair
p115
aVso that I could grow it back as my father had it
p116
aVwhen he first emigrated from India
p117
aVto the U.K. in the 1960s.
p118
aVHe had a side parting and a neat mustache.
p119
aa(lp120
VAt first, it was going very well.
p121
aVI even started to get discounts in Indian shops.
p122
aa(lp123
V(Laughter)
p124
aa(lp125
VBut then very quickly,
p126
aVI started to underestimate
p127
aVmy mustache growing ability,
p128
aVand it got way too big.
p129
aVIt didn't look Indian anymore.
p130
aVInstead, people from across the road,
p131
aVthey would shout things like \u2014
p132
aa(lp133
VHP and YR: Arriba! Arriba! Ándale! Ándale!
p134
aa(lp135
V(Laughter)
p136
aa(lp137
VHP: Actually, I don't know why I am even talking like this.
p138
aVMy dad doesn't even have an Indian accent anymore.
p139
aVHe talks like this now.
p140
aa(lp141
VSo it's not just my father that I've imitated.
p142
aVA few years ago I went to China for a few months,
p143
aVand I couldn't speak Chinese,
p144
aVand this frustrated me,
p145
aVso I wrote about this and had it translated
p146
aVinto Chinese, and then I learned this by heart,
p147
aVlike music, I guess.
p148
aa(lp149
VYR: This phrase is now etched into my mind
p150
aVclearer than the pin number to my bank card,
p151
aVso I can pretend I speak Chinese fluently.
p152
aVWhen I had learned this phrase,
p153
aVI had an artist over there hear me out
p154
aVto see how accurate it sounded.
p155
aa(lp156
VI spoke the phrase, and then he laughed
p157
aVand told me, "Oh yeah, that's great,
p158
aVonly it kind of sounds like a woman."
p159
aa(lp160
VI said, "What?"
p161
aa(lp162
VHe said, "Yeah, you learned from a woman?"
p163
aa(lp164
VI said, "Yes. So?"
p165
aa(lp166
VHe then explained the tonal differences
p167
aVbetween male and female voices
p168
aVare very different and distinct, and that I had learned it very well,
p169
aVbut in a woman's voice.
p170
aa(lp171
V(Laughter)
p172
aa(lp173
V(Applause)
p174
aa(lp175
VHP: Okay. So this imitation business
p176
aVdoes come with risk.
p177
aVIt doesn't always go as you plan it,
p178
aVeven with a talented translator.
p179
aVBut I am going to stick with it,
p180
aVbecause contrary to what we might usually assume,
p181
aVimitating somebody can reveal something unique.
p182
aVSo every time I fail
p183
aVto become more like my father,
p184
aVI become more like myself.
p185
aVEvery time I fail to become Bruce Lee,
p186
aVI become more authentically me.
p187
aa(lp188
VThis is my art.
p189
aVI strive for authenticity,
p190
aVeven if it comes in a shape
p191
aVthat we might not usually expect.
p192
aVIt's only recently that I've started to understand
p193
aVthat I didn't learn to sit like this
p194
aVthrough being Indian.
p195
aVI learned this from Spider-Man.
p196
aa(lp197
V(Laughter)
p198
aa(lp199
VThank you.
