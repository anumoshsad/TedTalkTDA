VImagine you're in a bar, or a club,
p4
aVand you start talking, and after a while, the question comes up,
p5
aV"So, what do you do for work?"
p6
aVAnd since you think your job is interesting,
p7
aVyou say, "I'm a mathematician." (Laughter)
p8
aVAnd inevitably, during that conversation
p9
aVone of these two phrases come up:
p10
aVA) "I was terrible at math, but it wasn't my fault.
p11
aVIt's because the teacher was awful." (Laughter)
p12
aVOr B) "But what is math really for?"
p13
aV(Laughter)
p14
aVI'll now address Case B.
p15
aV(Laughter)
p16
aa(lp17
VWhen someone asks you what math is for, they're not asking you
p18
aVabout applications of mathematical science.
p19
aVThey're asking you,
p20
aVwhy did I have to study that bullshit I never used in my life again? (Laughter)
p21
aVThat's what they're actually asking.
p22
aVSo when mathematicians are asked what math is for,
p23
aVthey tend to fall into two groups:
p24
aV54.51 percent of mathematicians will assume an attacking position,
p25
aVand 44.77 percent of mathematicians will take a defensive position.
p26
aVThere's a strange 0.8 percent, among which I include myself.
p27
aa(lp28
VWho are the ones that attack?
p29
aVThe attacking ones are mathematicians who would tell you
p30
aVthis question makes no sense,
p31
aVbecause mathematics have a meaning all their own \u2014
p32
aVa beautiful edifice with its own logic \u2014
p33
aVand that there's no point
p34
aVin constantly searching for all possible applications.
p35
aVWhat's the use of poetry? What's the use of love?
p36
aVWhat's the use of life itself?  What kind of question is that?
p37
aV(Laughter)
p38
aVHardy, for instance, was a model of this type of attack.
p39
aa(lp40
VAnd those who stand in defense tell you,
p41
aV"Even if you don't realize it, friend, math is behind everything."
p42
aV(Laughter)
p43
aVThose guys,
p44
aVthey always bring up bridges and computers.
p45
aV"If you don't know math, your bridge will collapse."
p46
aV(Laughter)
p47
aVIt's true, computers are all about math.
p48
aVAnd now these guys have also started saying
p49
aVthat behind information security and credit cards are prime numbers.
p50
aVThese are the answers your math teacher would give you if you asked him.
p51
aVHe's one of the defensive ones.
p52
aa(lp53
VOkay, but who's right then?
p54
aVThose who say that math doesn't need to have a purpose,
p55
aVor those who say that math is behind everything we do?
p56
aVActually, both are right.
p57
aVBut remember I told you
p58
aVI belong to that strange 0.8 percent claiming something else?
p59
aVSo, go ahead, ask me what math is for.
p60
aa(lp61
VAudience: What is math for?
p62
aa(lp63
VEduardo Sáenz de Cabezón: Okay, 76.34 percent of you asked the question,
p64
aV23.41 percent didn't say anything,
p65
aVand the 0.8 percent \u2014
p66
aVI'm not sure what those guys are doing.
p67
aVWell, to my dear 76.31 percent \u2014
p68
aVit's true that math doesn't need to serve a purpose,
p69
aVit's true that it's a beautiful structure, a logical one,
p70
aVprobably one of the greatest collective efforts
p71
aVever achieved in human history.
p72
aVBut it's also true that there,
p73
aVwhere scientists and technicians are looking for mathematical theories
p74
aVthat allow them to advance,
p75
aVthey're within the structure of math, which permeates everything.
p76
aa(lp77
VIt's true that we have to go somewhat deeper,
p78
aVto see what's behind science.
p79
aVScience operates on intuition, creativity.
p80
aVMath controls intuition and tames creativity.
p81
aVAlmost everyone who hasn't heard this before
p82
aVis surprised when they hear that if you take
p83
aVa 0.1 millimeter thick sheet of paper, the size we normally use,
p84
aVand, if it were big enough, fold it 50 times,
p85
aVits thickness would extend almost the distance from the Earth to the sun.
p86
aVYour intuition tells you it's impossible.
p87
aVDo the math and you'll see it's right.
p88
aVThat's what math is for.
p89
aa(lp90
VIt's true that science, all types of science, only makes sense
p91
aVbecause it makes us better understand this beautiful world we live in.
p92
aVAnd in doing that,
p93
aVit helps us avoid the pitfalls of this painful world we live in.
p94
aVThere are sciences that help us in this way quite directly.
p95
aVOncological science, for example.
p96
aVAnd there are others we look at from afar, with envy sometimes,
p97
aVbut knowing that we are what supports them.
p98
aVAll the basic sciences support them,
p99
aVincluding math.
p100
aVAll that makes science, science is the rigor of math.
p101
aVAnd that rigor factors in because its results are eternal.
p102
aa(lp103
VYou probably said or were told at some point
p104
aVthat diamonds are forever, right?
p105
aVThat depends on your definition of forever!
p106
aVA theorem \u2014 that really is forever.
p107
aV(Laughter)
p108
aVThe Pythagorean theorem is still true
p109
aVeven though Pythagoras is dead, I assure you it's true. (Laughter)
p110
aVEven if the world collapsed
p111
aVthe Pythagorean theorem would still be true.
p112
aVWherever any two triangle sides and a good hypotenuse get together
p113
aV(Laughter)
p114
aVthe Pythagorean theorem goes all out. It works like crazy.
p115
aV(Applause)
p116
aa(lp117
VWell, we mathematicians devote ourselves to come up with theorems.
p118
aVEternal truths.
p119
aVBut it isn't always easy to know the difference between
p120
aVan eternal truth, or theorem, and a mere conjecture.
p121
aVYou need proof.
p122
aVFor example,
p123
aVlet's say I have a big, enormous, infinite field.
p124
aVI want to cover it with equal pieces, without leaving any gaps.
p125
aVI could use squares, right?
p126
aVI could use triangles. Not circles, those leave little gaps.
p127
aVWhich is the best shape to use?
p128
aVOne that covers the same surface, but has a smaller border.
p129
aVIn the year 300, Pappus of Alexandria said the best is to use hexagons,
p130
aVjust like bees do.
p131
aVBut he didn't prove it.
p132
aVThe guy said, "Hexagons, great! Let's go with hexagons!"
p133
aVHe didn't prove it, it remained a conjecture.
p134
aV"Hexagons!"
p135
aVAnd the world, as you know, split into Pappists and anti-Pappists,
p136
aVuntil 1700 years later
p137
aVwhen in 1999, Thomas Hales proved
p138
aVthat Pappus and the bees were right \u2014 the best shape to use was the hexagon.
p139
aVAnd that became a theorem, the honeycomb theorem,
p140
aVthat will be true forever and ever,
p141
aVfor longer than any diamond you may have. (Laughter)
p142
aa(lp143
VBut what happens if we go to three dimensions?
p144
aVIf I want to fill the space with equal pieces,
p145
aVwithout leaving any gaps,
p146
aVI can use cubes, right?
p147
aVNot spheres, those leave little gaps. (Laughter)
p148
aVWhat is the best shape to use?
p149
aVLord Kelvin, of the famous Kelvin degrees and all,
p150
aVsaid that the best was to use a truncated octahedron
p151
aVwhich, as you all know \u2014
p152
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p153
aVis this thing here!
p154
aV(Applause)
p155
aVCome on.
p156
aVWho doesn't have a truncated octahedron at home? (Laughter)
p157
aVEven a plastic one.
p158
aV"Honey, get the truncated octahedron, we're having guests."
p159
aVEverybody has one! (Laughter)
p160
aa(lp161
VBut Kelvin didn't prove it.
p162
aVIt remained a conjecture \u2014 Kelvin's conjecture.
p163
aVThe world, as you know, then split into Kelvinists and anti-Kelvinists
p164
aV(Laughter)
p165
aVuntil a hundred or so years later,
p166
aVsomeone found a better structure.
p167
aVWeaire and Phelan found this little thing over here \u2014
p168
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p169
aVthis structure to which they gave the very clever name
p170
aV"the Weaire-€“Phelan structure."
p171
aV(Laughter)
p172
aVIt looks like a strange object, but it isn't so strange,
p173
aVit also exists in nature.
p174
aVIt's very interesting that this structure,
p175
aVbecause of its geometric properties,
p176
aVwas used to build the Aquatics Center for the Beijing Olympic Games.
p177
aa(lp178
VThere, Michael Phelps won eight gold medals,
p179
aVand became the best swimmer of all time.
p180
aVWell, until someone better comes along, right?
p181
aVAs may happen with the Weaire-€“Phelan structure.
p182
aVIt's the best until something better shows up.
p183
aVBut be careful, because this one really stands a chance
p184
aVthat in a hundred or so years, or even if it's in 1700 years,
p185
aVthat someone proves it's the best possible shape for the job.
p186
aVIt will then become a theorem, a truth, forever and ever.
p187
aVFor longer than any diamond.
p188
aa(lp189
VSo, if you want to tell someone
p190
aVthat you will love them forever
p191
aVyou can give them a diamond.
p192
aVBut if you want to tell them that you'll love them forever and ever,
p193
aVgive them a theorem!
p194
aV(Laughter)
p195
aVBut hang on a minute!
p196
aVYou'll have to prove it,
p197
aVso your love doesn't remain
p198
aVa conjecture.
