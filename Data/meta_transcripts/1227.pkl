VErez Lieberman Aiden: Everyone knows
p4
aVthat a picture is worth a thousand words.
p5
aVBut we at Harvard
p6
aVwere wondering if this was really true.
p7
aV(Laughter)
p8
aVSo we assembled a team of experts,
p9
aVspanning Harvard, MIT,
p10
aVThe American Heritage Dictionary, The Encyclopedia Britannica
p11
aVand even our proud sponsors,
p12
aVthe Google.
p13
aVAnd we cogitated about this
p14
aVfor about four years.
p15
aVAnd we came to a startling conclusion.
p16
aVLadies and gentlemen, a picture is not worth a thousand words.
p17
aVIn fact, we found some pictures
p18
aVthat are worth 500 billion words.
p19
aa(lp20
VJean-Baptiste Michel: So how did we get to this conclusion?
p21
aVSo Erez and I were thinking about ways
p22
aVto get a big picture of human culture
p23
aVand human history: change over time.
p24
aVSo many books actually have been written over the years.
p25
aVSo we were thinking, well the best way to learn from them
p26
aVis to read all of these millions of books.
p27
aVNow of course, if there's a scale for how awesome that is,
p28
aVthat has to rank extremely, extremely high.
p29
aVNow the problem is there's an X-axis for that,
p30
aVwhich is the practical axis.
p31
aVThis is very, very low.
p32
aa(lp33
V(Applause)
p34
aa(lp35
VNow people tend to use an alternative approach,
p36
aVwhich is to take a few sources and read them very carefully.
p37
aVThis is extremely practical, but not so awesome.
p38
aVWhat you really want to do
p39
aVis to get to the awesome yet practical part of this space.
p40
aVSo it turns out there was a company across the river called Google
p41
aVwho had started a digitization project a few years back
p42
aVthat might just enable this approach.
p43
aVThey have digitized millions of books.
p44
aVSo what that means is, one could use computational methods
p45
aVto read all of the books in a click of a button.
p46
aVThat's very practical and extremely awesome.
p47
aa(lp48
VELA: Let me tell you a little bit about where books come from.
p49
aVSince time immemorial, there have been authors.
p50
aVThese authors have been striving to write books.
p51
aVAnd this became considerably easier
p52
aVwith the development of the printing press some centuries ago.
p53
aVSince then, the authors have won
p54
aVon 129 million distinct occasions,
p55
aVpublishing books.
p56
aVNow if those books are not lost to history,
p57
aVthen they are somewhere in a library,
p58
aVand many of those books have been getting retrieved from the libraries
p59
aVand digitized by Google,
p60
aVwhich has scanned 15 million books to date.
p61
aa(lp62
VNow when Google digitizes a book, they put it into a really nice format.
p63
aVNow we've got the data, plus we have metadata.
p64
aVWe have information about things like where was it published,
p65
aVwho was the author, when was it published.
p66
aVAnd what we do is go through all of those records
p67
aVand exclude everything that's not the highest quality data.
p68
aVWhat we're left with
p69
aVis a collection of five million books,
p70
aV500 billion words,
p71
aVa string of characters a thousand times longer
p72
aVthan the human genome \u2014
p73
aVa text which, when written out,
p74
aVwould stretch from here to the Moon and back
p75
aV10 times over \u2014
p76
aVa veritable shard of our cultural genome.
p77
aVOf course what we did
p78
aVwhen faced with such outrageous hyperbole ...
p79
aV(Laughter)
p80
aVwas what any self-respecting researchers
p81
aVwould have done.
p82
aVWe took a page out of XKCD,
p83
aVand we said, "Stand back.
p84
aVWe're going to try science."
p85
aa(lp86
V(Laughter)
p87
aa(lp88
VJM: Now of course, we were thinking,
p89
aVwell let's just first put the data out there
p90
aVfor people to do science to it.
p91
aVNow we're thinking, what data can we release?
p92
aVWell of course, you want to take the books
p93
aVand release the full text of these five million books.
p94
aVNow Google, and Jon Orwant in particular,
p95
aVtold us a little equation that we should learn.
p96
aVSo you have five million, that is, five million authors
p97
aVand five million plaintiffs is a massive lawsuit.
p98
aVSo, although that would be really, really awesome,
p99
aVagain, that's extremely, extremely impractical.
p100
aV(Laughter)
p101
aa(lp102
VNow again, we kind of caved in,
p103
aVand we did the very practical approach, which was a bit less awesome.
p104
aVWe said, well instead of releasing the full text,
p105
aVwe're going to release statistics about the books.
p106
aVSo take for instance "A gleam of happiness."
p107
aVIt's four words; we call that a four-gram.
p108
aVWe're going to tell you how many times a particular four-gram
p109
aVappeared in books in 1801, 1802, 1803,
p110
aVall the way up to 2008.
p111
aVThat gives us a time series
p112
aVof how frequently this particular sentence was used over time.
p113
aVWe do that for all the words and phrases that appear in those books,
p114
aVand that gives us a big table of two billion lines
p115
aVthat tell us about the way culture has been changing.
p116
aa(lp117
VELA: So those two billion lines,
p118
aVwe call them two billion n-grams.
p119
aVWhat do they tell us?
p120
aVWell the individual n-grams measure cultural trends.
p121
aVLet me give you an example.
p122
aVLet's suppose that I am thriving,
p123
aVthen tomorrow I want to tell you about how well I did.
p124
aVAnd so I might say, "Yesterday, I throve."
p125
aVAlternatively, I could say, "Yesterday, I thrived."
p126
aVWell which one should I use?
p127
aVHow to know?
p128
aa(lp129
VAs of about six months ago,
p130
aVthe state of the art in this field
p131
aVis that you would, for instance,
p132
aVgo up to the following psychologist with fabulous hair,
p133
aVand you'd say,
p134
aV"Steve, you're an expert on the irregular verbs.
p135
aVWhat should I do?"
p136
aVAnd he'd tell you, "Well most people say thrived,
p137
aVbut some people say throve."
p138
aVAnd you also knew, more or less,
p139
aVthat if you were to go back in time 200 years
p140
aVand ask the following statesman with equally fabulous hair,
p141
aV(Laughter)
p142
aV"Tom, what should I say?"
p143
aVHe'd say, "Well, in my day, most people throve,
p144
aVbut some thrived."
p145
aVSo now what I'm just going to show you is raw data.
p146
aVTwo rows from this table of two billion entries.
p147
aVWhat you're seeing is year by year frequency
p148
aVof "thrived" and "throve" over time.
p149
aVNow this is just two
p150
aVout of two billion rows.
p151
aVSo the entire data set
p152
aVis a billion times more awesome than this slide.
p153
aa(lp154
V(Laughter)
p155
aa(lp156
V(Applause)
p157
aa(lp158
VJM: Now there are many other pictures that are worth 500 billion words.
p159
aVFor instance, this one.
p160
aVIf you just take influenza,
p161
aVyou will see peaks at the time where you knew
p162
aVbig flu epidemics were killing people around the globe.
p163
aa(lp164
VELA: If you were not yet convinced,
p165
aVsea levels are rising,
p166
aVso is atmospheric CO2 and global temperature.
p167
aa(lp168
VJM: You might also want to have a look at this particular n-gram,
p169
aVand that's to tell Nietzsche that God is not dead,
p170
aValthough you might agree that he might need a better publicist.
p171
aa(lp172
V(Laughter)
p173
aa(lp174
VELA: You can get at some pretty abstract concepts with this sort of thing.
p175
aVFor instance, let me tell you the history
p176
aVof the year 1950.
p177
aVPretty much for the vast majority of history,
p178
aVno one gave a damn about 1950.
p179
aVIn 1700, in 1800, in 1900,
p180
aVno one cared.
p181
aVThrough the 30s and 40s,
p182
aVno one cared.
p183
aVSuddenly, in the mid-40s,
p184
aVthere started to be a buzz.
p185
aVPeople realized that 1950 was going to happen,
p186
aVand it could be big.
p187
aV(Laughter)
p188
aVBut nothing got people interested in 1950
p189
aVlike the year 1950.
p190
aV(Laughter)
p191
aVPeople were walking around obsessed.
p192
aVThey couldn't stop talking
p193
aVabout all the things they did in 1950,
p194
aVall the things they were planning to do in 1950,
p195
aVall the dreams of what they wanted to accomplish in 1950.
p196
aVIn fact, 1950 was so fascinating
p197
aVthat for years thereafter,
p198
aVpeople just kept talking about all the amazing things that happened,
p199
aVin '51, '52, '53.
p200
aVFinally in 1954,
p201
aVsomeone woke up and realized
p202
aVthat 1950 had gotten somewhat passé.
p203
aV(Laughter)
p204
aVAnd just like that, the bubble burst.
p205
aa(lp206
V(Laughter)
p207
aa(lp208
VAnd the story of 1950
p209
aVis the story of every year that we have on record,
p210
aVwith a little twist, because now we've got these nice charts.
p211
aVAnd because we have these nice charts, we can measure things.
p212
aVWe can say, "Well how fast does the bubble burst?"
p213
aVAnd it turns out that we can measure that very precisely.
p214
aVEquations were derived, graphs were produced,
p215
aVand the net result
p216
aVis that we find that the bubble bursts faster and faster
p217
aVwith each passing year.
p218
aVWe are losing interest in the past more rapidly.
p219
aa(lp220
VJM: Now a little piece of career advice.
p221
aVSo for those of you who seek to be famous,
p222
aVwe can learn from the 25 most famous political figures,
p223
aVauthors, actors and so on.
p224
aVSo if you want to become famous early on, you should be an actor,
p225
aVbecause then fame starts rising by the end of your 20s \u2014
p226
aVyou're still young, it's really great.
p227
aVNow if you can wait a little bit, you should be an author,
p228
aVbecause then you rise to very great heights,
p229
aVlike Mark Twain, for instance: extremely famous.
p230
aVBut if you want to reach the very top,
p231
aVyou should delay gratification
p232
aVand, of course, become a politician.
p233
aVSo here you will become famous by the end of your 50s,
p234
aVand become very, very famous afterward.
p235
aVSo scientists also tend to get famous when they're much older.
p236
aVLike for instance, biologists and physics
p237
aVtend to be almost as famous as actors.
p238
aVOne mistake you should not do is become a mathematician.
p239
aV(Laughter)
p240
aVIf you do that,
p241
aVyou might think, "Oh great. I'm going to do my best work when I'm in my 20s."
p242
aVBut guess what, nobody will really care.
p243
aa(lp244
V(Laughter)
p245
aa(lp246
VELA: There are more sobering notes
p247
aVamong the n-grams.
p248
aVFor instance, here's the trajectory of Marc Chagall,
p249
aVan artist born in 1887.
p250
aVAnd this looks like the normal trajectory of a famous person.
p251
aVHe gets more and more and more famous,
p252
aVexcept if you look in German.
p253
aVIf you look in German, you see something completely bizarre,
p254
aVsomething you pretty much never see,
p255
aVwhich is he becomes extremely famous
p256
aVand then all of a sudden plummets,
p257
aVgoing through a nadir between 1933 and 1945,
p258
aVbefore rebounding afterward.
p259
aVAnd of course, what we're seeing
p260
aVis the fact Marc Chagall was a Jewish artist
p261
aVin Nazi Germany.
p262
aa(lp263
VNow these signals
p264
aVare actually so strong
p265
aVthat we don't need to know that someone was censored.
p266
aVWe can actually figure it out
p267
aVusing really basic signal processing.
p268
aVHere's a simple way to do it.
p269
aVWell, a reasonable expectation
p270
aVis that somebody's fame in a given period of time
p271
aVshould be roughly the average of their fame before
p272
aVand their fame after.
p273
aVSo that's sort of what we expect.
p274
aVAnd we compare that to the fame that we observe.
p275
aVAnd we just divide one by the other
p276
aVto produce something we call a suppression index.
p277
aVIf the suppression index is very, very, very small,
p278
aVthen you very well might be being suppressed.
p279
aVIf it's very large, maybe you're benefiting from propaganda.
p280
aa(lp281
VJM: Now you can actually look at
p282
aVthe distribution of suppression indexes over whole populations.
p283
aVSo for instance, here \u2014
p284
aVthis suppression index is for 5,000 people
p285
aVpicked in English books where there's no known suppression \u2014
p286
aVit would be like this, basically tightly centered on one.
p287
aVWhat you expect is basically what you observe.
p288
aVThis is distribution as seen in Germany \u2014
p289
aVvery different, it's shifted to the left.
p290
aVPeople talked about it twice less as it should have been.
p291
aVBut much more importantly, the distribution is much wider.
p292
aVThere are many people who end up on the far left on this distribution
p293
aVwho are talked about 10 times fewer than they should have been.
p294
aVBut then also many people on the far right
p295
aVwho seem to benefit from propaganda.
p296
aVThis picture is the hallmark of censorship in the book record.
p297
aa(lp298
VELA: So culturomics
p299
aVis what we call this method.
p300
aVIt's kind of like genomics.
p301
aVExcept genomics is a lens on biology
p302
aVthrough the window of the sequence of bases in the human genome.
p303
aVCulturomics is similar.
p304
aVIt's the application of massive-scale data collection analysis
p305
aVto the study of human culture.
p306
aVHere, instead of through the lens of a genome,
p307
aVthrough the lens of digitized pieces of the historical record.
p308
aVThe great thing about culturomics
p309
aVis that everyone can do it.
p310
aVWhy can everyone do it?
p311
aVEveryone can do it because three guys,
p312
aVJon Orwant, Matt Gray and Will Brockman over at Google,
p313
aVsaw the prototype of the Ngram Viewer,
p314
aVand they said, "This is so fun.
p315
aVWe have to make this available for people."
p316
aVSo in two weeks flat \u2014 the two weeks before our paper came out \u2014
p317
aVthey coded up a version of the Ngram Viewer for the general public.
p318
aVAnd so you too can type in any word or phrase that you're interested in
p319
aVand see its n-gram immediately \u2014
p320
aValso browse examples of all the various books
p321
aVin which your n-gram appears.
p322
aa(lp323
VJM: Now this was used over a million times on the first day,
p324
aVand this is really the best of all the queries.
p325
aVSo people want to be their best, put their best foot forward.
p326
aVBut it turns out in the 18th century, people didn't really care about that at all.
p327
aVThey didn't want to be their best, they wanted to be their beft.
p328
aVSo what happened is, of course, this is just a mistake.
p329
aVIt's not that strove for mediocrity,
p330
aVit's just that the S used to be written differently, kind of like an F.
p331
aVNow of course, Google didn't pick this up at the time,
p332
aVso we reported this in the science article that we wrote.
p333
aVBut it turns out this is just a reminder
p334
aVthat, although this is a lot of fun,
p335
aVwhen you interpret these graphs, you have to be very careful,
p336
aVand you have to adopt the base standards in the sciences.
p337
aa(lp338
VELA: People have been using this for all kinds of fun purposes.
p339
aV(Laughter)
p340
aVActually, we're not going to have to talk,
p341
aVwe're just going to show you all the slides and remain silent.
p342
aVThis person was interested in the history of frustration.
p343
aVThere's various types of frustration.
p344
aVIf you stub your toe, that's a one A "argh."
p345
aVIf the planet Earth is annihilated by the Vogons
p346
aVto make room for an interstellar bypass,
p347
aVthat's an eight A "aaaaaaaargh."
p348
aVThis person studies all the "arghs,"
p349
aVfrom one through eight A's.
p350
aVAnd it turns out
p351
aVthat the less-frequent "arghs"
p352
aVare, of course, the ones that correspond to things that are more frustrating \u2014
p353
aVexcept, oddly, in the early 80s.
p354
aVWe think that might have something to do with Reagan.
p355
aa(lp356
V(Laughter)
p357
aa(lp358
VJM: There are many usages of this data,
p359
aVbut the bottom line is that the historical record is being digitized.
p360
aVGoogle has started to digitize 15 million books.
p361
aVThat's 12 percent of all the books that have ever been published.
p362
aVIt's a sizable chunk of human culture.
p363
aVThere's much more in culture: there's manuscripts, there newspapers,
p364
aVthere's things that are not text, like art and paintings.
p365
aVThese all happen to be on our computers,
p366
aVon computers across the world.
p367
aVAnd when that happens, that will transform the way we have
p368
aVto understand our past, our present and human culture.
p369
