VOver the past couple of days,
p4
aVas I've been preparing for my speech,
p5
aVI've become more and more nervous about what I'm going to say
p6
aVand about being on the same stage as all these fascinating people.
p7
aVBeing on the same stage as Al Gore, who was the first person I ever voted for.
p8
aVAnd \u2014
p9
aa(lp10
V(Laughter)
p11
aa(lp12
VSo I was getting pretty nervous
p13
aVand, you know, I didn't know that Chris sits on the stage,
p14
aVand that's more nerve-racking.
p15
aVBut then I started thinking about my family.
p16
aVI started thinking about my father and my grandfather
p17
aVand my great-grandfather,
p18
aVand I realized
p19
aVthat I had all of these Teds going through my bloodstream \u2014
p20
aa(lp21
V(Laughter)
p22
aa(lp23
Vthat I had to consider this "my element."
p24
aa(lp25
VSo, who am I?
p26
aVChris kind of mentioned I started a company with my husband.
p27
aVWe have about 125 people internationally.
p28
aVIf you looked in the book,
p29
aVyou saw this ...
p30
aa(lp31
V(Laughter)
p32
aa(lp33
Vwhich I really was appalled by.
p34
aa(lp35
V(Laughter)
p36
aa(lp37
VAnd because I wanted to impress you all with slides,
p38
aVsince I saw the great presentations yesterday with graphs,
p39
aVI made a graph that moves,
p40
aVand I talk about the makeup of me.
p41
aa(lp42
V(Laughter)
p43
aa(lp44
VSo, besides this freakish thing,
p45
aVthis is my science slide.
p46
aVThis is math, and this is science, this is genetics.
p47
aVThis is my grandmother, and this is where I get this mouth.
p48
aa(lp49
V(Laughter)
p50
aa(lp51
VSo \u2014
p52
aVI'm a blogger, which, probably, to a lot of you, means different things.
p53
aVYou may have heard about the Kryptonite lock brouhaha,
p54
aVwhere a blogger talked about how you hack
p55
aVor break into a Kryptonite lock using a ballpoint pen,
p56
aVand it spread all over.
p57
aVKryptonite had to adjust the lock,
p58
aVand they had to address it to avoid too many customer concerns.
p59
aVYou may have heard about Rathergate,
p60
aVwhich was basically the result of bloggers
p61
aVrealizing that the "th" in 111
p62
aVis not typeset on an old typewriter;
p63
aVit's on Word.
p64
aVBloggers exposed this,
p65
aVor they worked hard to expose this.
p66
aVYou know, blogs are scary. This is what you see.
p67
aVI see this, and I'm sure scared \u2014 I swear on stage \u2014 shitless about blogs,
p68
aVbecause this is not something that's friendly.
p69
aVBut there are blogs that are changing the way we read news
p70
aVand consume media, and these are great examples.
p71
aVThese people are reaching thousands,
p72
aVif not millions, of readers,
p73
aVand that's incredibly important.
p74
aVDuring the hurricane,
p75
aVyou had MSNBC posting about the hurricane on their blog,
p76
aVupdating it frequently.
p77
aVThis was possible because of the easy nature of blogging tools.
p78
aa(lp79
VYou have my friend,
p80
aVwho has a blog on PVRs, personal recorders.
p81
aVHe makes enough money just by running ads,
p82
aVto support his family up in Oregon.
p83
aVThat's all he does now,
p84
aVand this is something that blogs have made possible.
p85
aVAnd then you have something like this, which is Interplast.
p86
aVIt's a wonderful organization
p87
aVof people and doctors who go to developing nations
p88
aVto offer plastic surgery to those who need it.
p89
aVChildren with cleft palates get it, and they document their story.
p90
aVThis is wonderful.
p91
aVI am not that caring.
p92
aa(lp93
V(Laughter)
p94
aa(lp95
VI talk about myself.
p96
aVThat's what I am. I'm a blogger.
p97
aVI have always decided that I was going to be an expert on one thing,
p98
aVand I am an expert on this person,
p99
aVand so I write about it.
p100
aVSo, the short story about my blog:
p101
aVit started in 2001, I was 23.
p102
aVI wasn't happy with my job,
p103
aVbecause I was a designer,
p104
aVbut I wasn't being really stimulated.
p105
aVI was an English major in college.
p106
aVI didn't have any use for it, but I missed writing.
p107
aVSo, I started to write a blog
p108
aVand I started to create things like these little stories.
p109
aVThis was an illustration about my camp experience when I was 11 years old,
p110
aVand how I went to a YMCA camp, Christian camp,
p111
aVand basically by the end,
p112
aVI had made my friends hate me so much that I hid in a bunk,
p113
aVThey couldn't find me, they sent a search party,
p114
aVand I overheard people saying they wish I had killed myself \u2014
p115
aVjumped off Bible Peak.
p116
aa(lp117
VYou can laugh, this is OK.
p118
aa(lp119
V(Laughter)
p120
aa(lp121
VThis is me.
p122
aVThis is what happened to me.
p123
aVAnd when I started my blog, it was really this one goal \u2014
p124
aVI said, "I am not going to be famous to the world,
p125
aVbut I could be famous to people on the Internet."
p126
aVAnd I set a goal.
p127
aVI said, "I'm going to win an award,"
p128
aVbecause I had never won an award in my entire life.
p129
aVAnd I said, "I'm going to win the South by Southwest Weblog award."
p130
aVAnd I won it \u2014 I reached all of these people,
p131
aVand I had tens of thousands of people reading about my life every day.
p132
aa(lp133
VAnd then I wrote a post about a banjo.
p134
aVI wrote a post
p135
aVabout wanting to buy a banjo \u2014
p136
aVa $300 banjo, which is a lot of money.
p137
aVAnd I don't play instruments;
p138
aVI don't know anything about music.
p139
aVI like music, and I like banjos,
p140
aVand I think I probably heard Steve Martin playing,
p141
aVand I said, "I could do that."
p142
aVAnd I said to my husband,
p143
aV"Ben, can I buy a banjo?" And he's like, "No."
p144
aa(lp145
VAnd my husband \u2014
p146
aa(lp147
V(Laughter)
p148
aa(lp149
Vthis is my husband, who is very hot \u2014
p150
aVhe won an award for being hot.
p151
aa(lp152
V(Laughter)
p153
aa(lp154
VHe told me,
p155
aV"You cannot buy a banjo.
p156
aVYou're just like your dad," who collects instruments.
p157
aVAnd I wrote a post about how I was so mad at him,
p158
aVhe was such a tyrant \u2014 he would not let me buy this banjo.
p159
aVAnd those people who know me understood my joke \u2014
p160
aVthis is Mena, this is how I make a joke at people.
p161
aVBecause the joke in this is that this person is not a tyrant,
p162
aVthis person is so loving and so sweet
p163
aVthat he lets me dress him up
p164
aVand post pictures of him to my blog.
p165
aa(lp166
V(Laughter)
p167
aa(lp168
VAnd if he knew I was showing this right now \u2014 I put this in today \u2014
p169
aVhe would kill me.
p170
aa(lp171
VBut the thing was, my friends read it,
p172
aVand they're like, "Oh, that Mena, she wrote a post
p173
aVabout wanting a stupid thing and being stupid."
p174
aVBut I got emails from people that said,
p175
aV"Oh my God, your husband is such an asshole.
p176
aVHow much money does he spend on beer in a year?
p177
aVYou could take that money and buy your banjo.
p178
aVWhy don't you open a separate account?"
p179
aVI've been with him since I was 17, we've never had a separate bank account.
p180
aVThey said, "Separate your bank account.
p181
aVSpend your money; spend his money, that's it."
p182
aVAnd then I got people saying, "Leave him."
p183
aa(lp184
V(Laughter)
p185
aa(lp186
VI was like, "OK, what? Who are these people?
p187
aVAnd why are they reading this?"
p188
aVAnd I realized: I don't want to reach these people.
p189
aVI don't want to write for this public audience.
p190
aVAnd I started to kill my blog slowly.
p191
aVI'm like, I don't want to write this anymore.
p192
aVSlowly and slowly \u2014
p193
aa(lp194
VAnd I did tell personal stories from time to time.
p195
aVI wrote this one, and I put this up because of Einstein today.
p196
aVI'm going to get choked up, because this is my first pet,
p197
aVand she passed away two years ago.
p198
aVAnd I decided to break from, "I don't really write about my public life,"
p199
aVbecause I wanted to give her a little memorial.
p200
aVBut anyways, it's these sorts of personal stories \u2014
p201
aVYou know, you read the blogs about politics or about media,
p202
aVand gossip and all these things.
p203
aVThese are out there,
p204
aVbut it's more of the personal that interests me,
p205
aVand this is who I am.
p206
aa(lp207
VYou see Norman Rockwell, and you have art critics say,
p208
aV"Norman Rockwell is not art.
p209
aVNorman Rockwell hangs in living rooms and bathrooms,
p210
aVand this is not something to be considered high art."
p211
aVAnd I think this is one of the most important things
p212
aVto us as humans.
p213
aVThese things resonate with us,
p214
aVand, if you think about blogs, you think of high art blogs,
p215
aVthe history paintings about, you know, all the biblical stories,
p216
aVand then you have this.
p217
aVThese are the blogs that interest me: the people that just tell stories.
p218
aa(lp219
VOne story is about this baby, and his name is Odin.
p220
aVHis father was a blogger.
p221
aVAnd he was writing his blog one day,
p222
aVand his wife gave birth to her baby
p223
aVat 25 weeks.
p224
aVAnd he never expected this.
p225
aVOne day, it was normal; the next day, it was hell.
p226
aVAnd this is a one-pound baby.
p227
aVSo Odin was documented every single day.
p228
aa(lp229
VPictures were taken every day: day one, day two ...
p230
aVYou have day nine \u2014 they're talking about his apnea;
p231
aVday 39 \u2014 he gets pneumonia.
p232
aVHis baby is so small,
p233
aVand I've never encountered such a \u2014
p234
aVjust \u2014 a disturbing image, but just so heartfelt.
p235
aVAnd you're reading this as it happens,
p236
aVso on day 55, everybody reads that he's having failures:
p237
aVbreathing failures and heart failures,
p238
aVand it's slowing down, and you don't know what to expect.
p239
aa(lp240
VBut then it gets better. Day 96, he goes home.
p241
aVAnd you see this post.
p242
aVThat's not something you're going to see in a paper or magazine
p243
aVbut this is something this person feels,
p244
aVand people are excited about it \u2014 28 comments.
p245
aVThat's not a huge amount of people reading,
p246
aVbut 28 people matter.
p247
aVAnd today, he is a healthy baby,
p248
aVwho, if you read his blog \u2014
p249
aVit's snowdeal.org, his father's blog \u2014
p250
aVhe is taking pictures of him still, because he is still his son
p251
aVand he is, I think, at his age level right now
p252
aVbecause he had received such great treatment from the hospital.
p253
aa(lp254
VSo, blogs.
p255
aVSo what? You've probably heard these things before.
p256
aVWe talked about the WELL, and about all these sorts of things
p257
aVthroughout our online history.
p258
aVBut I think blogs are basically just an evolution,
p259
aVand that's where we are today.
p260
aVIt's this record of who you are, your persona.
p261
aVYou have your Google search, where you say, "What is Mena Trott?"
p262
aVAnd then you find these things and you're happy or unhappy.
p263
aVBut then you also find people's blogs,
p264
aVand those are the records of people that are writing daily \u2014
p265
aVnot necessarily about the same topic, but things that interest them.
p266
aVAnd we talk about the world flattens, being in this panel,
p267
aVand I am very optimistic \u2014 whenever I think about blogs,
p268
aVI'm like, "We've got to reach all these people."
p269
aVHundreds of millions and billions of people.
p270
aVWe're getting into China, we want to be there,
p271
aVbut there are so many people that won't have the access to write a blog.
p272
aVBut to see something like the $100 computer is amazing,
p273
aVbecause blogging software is simple.
p274
aVWe have a successful company because of timing,
p275
aVand because of perseverance, but it's simple stuff \u2014
p276
aVit's not rocket science.
p277
aVAnd so, that's an amazing thing to consider.
p278
aVSo \u2014
p279
aVthe life record of a blog is something that I find incredibly important.
p280
aa(lp281
VAnd we started with a slide of my Teds,
p282
aVand I had to add this slide,
p283
aVbecause I knew the minute I showed this, my mom \u2014
p284
aVmy mom will see this, because she does read my blog
p285
aVand she'll say, "Why wasn't there a picture of me?"
p286
aVThis is my mom.
p287
aVSo, I have all the people that I know of.
p288
aVBut this is basically the extent of the family that I know
p289
aVin terms of my direct line.
p290
aVI showed a Norman Rockwell painting before, and this one, I grew up with,
p291
aVlooking at constantly.
p292
aVI would spend hours looking at the connections,
p293
aVsaying, "Oh, the little kid up at the top has red hair;
p294
aVso does that first generation up there."
p295
aVAnd it's just these little things.
p296
aVThis is not science, but this was enough for me
p297
aVto be really interested in how we have evolved
p298
aVand how we can trace our line.
p299
aVSo that has always influenced me.
p300
aa(lp301
VI have this record, this 1910 census,
p302
aVof another Grabowski \u2014 that's my maiden name \u2014
p303
aVand there's a Theodore, because there's always a Theodore.
p304
aVThis is all I have, a couple of facts about somebody.
p305
aVI have their date of birth, their age, what they did in their household,
p306
aVif they spoke English,
p307
aVand that's it, that's all I know of these people.
p308
aVAnd it's pretty sad,
p309
aVbecause I only go back five generations, and that's it.
p310
aVI don't even know what happens on my mom's side,
p311
aVbecause she's from Cuba and I don't have that many things.
p312
aVJust doing this, I spent time in the archives \u2014
p313
aVthat's why my husband's a saint \u2014
p314
aVI spent time in the Washington archives,
p315
aVjust sitting there, looking for these things.
p316
aVNow it's online, but he sat through that.
p317
aa(lp318
VAnd so you have this record and \u2014
p319
aVThis is my great-great-grandmother.
p320
aVThis is the only picture I have.
p321
aVAnd to think of what we have the ability to do with our blogs;
p322
aVto think about the people that are on those $100 computers,
p323
aVtalking about who they are, sharing these personal stories \u2014
p324
aVthis is an amazing thing.
p325
aa(lp326
VAnother photo that has greatly influenced me,
p327
aVor a series of photos, is this project
p328
aVthat's done by an Argentinean man and his wife.
p329
aVAnd he's basically taking a picture of his family every day
p330
aVfor the past, what is '76? \u2014 20 ... Oh my God, I'm '77 \u2014 29 years?
p331
aVTwenty-nine years.
p332
aa(lp333
VThere was a joke, originally, about my graph that I left out, which is:
p334
aVYou see all this math?
p335
aVI'm just happy I was able to add it up to 100,
p336
aVbecause that's my skill set.
p337
aa(lp338
V(Laughter)
p339
aa(lp340
VSo you have these people aging,
p341
aVand now this is them today, or last year.
p342
aVAnd that's a powerful thing to have, to be able to track this.
p343
aVI wish that I would have this of my family.
p344
aVI know that one day my children will be wondering \u2014
p345
aVor my grandchildren, or my great-grandchildren,
p346
aVif I ever have children \u2014
p347
aVwhat I am going to \u2014
p348
aVwho I was.
p349
aVSo I do something that's very narcissistic \u2014
p350
aa(lp351
VI am a blogger \u2014
p352
aVthat is an amazing thing for me,
p353
aVbecause it captures a moment in time every day.
p354
aVI take a picture of myself \u2014 I've been doing this since last year \u2014
p355
aVevery single day.
p356
aVAnd, you know, it's the same picture;
p357
aVit's basically the same person.
p358
aa(lp359
VOnly a couple of people read it.
p360
aVI don't write this for this audience;
p361
aVI'm showing it now, but I would go insane if this was really public.
p362
aVAbout four people probably read it,
p363
aVand they tell me, "You haven't updated."
p364
aVI'm probably going to get people telling me I haven't updated.
p365
aVBut this is amazing, because I can go back to a day \u2014 to April 2005,
p366
aVand say, what was I doing this day?
p367
aVI look at it, I know exactly.
p368
aVIt's this visual cue that is so important to what we do.
p369
aVI put the bad pictures up too,
p370
aVbecause there are bad pictures.
p371
aa(lp372
V(Laughter)
p373
aa(lp374
VAnd I remember instantly: I am in Germany in this \u2014
p375
aVI had to go for a one-day trip.
p376
aVI was sick, and I was in a hotel room,
p377
aVand I wanted not to be there.
p378
aVAnd so you see these things, it's not just always smiling.
p379
aVNow I've kind of evolved it, so I have this look.
p380
aVIf you look at my driver's license, I have the same look,
p381
aVand it's a pretty disturbing thing,
p382
aVbut it's something that is really important.
p383
aa(lp384
VAnd the last story I really want to tell is this story,
p385
aVbecause this is probably the one that means the most to me
p386
aVin all of what I'm doing.
p387
aVI'll probably get choked up, because I tend to when I talk about this.
p388
aVSo, this woman, her name was Emma,
p389
aVand she was a blogger on our service, TypePad.
p390
aVAnd she was a beta tester, so she was there right when we opened \u2014
p391
aVyou know, there was 100 people.
p392
aVAnd she wrote about her life dealing with cancer.
p393
aVShe was writing and writing, and we all started reading it,
p394
aVbecause we had so few blogs on the service,
p395
aVwe could keep track of everyone.
p396
aa(lp397
VAnd she was writing one day,
p398
aVand then she disappeared for a little bit.
p399
aVAnd her sister came on, and she said that Emma had passed away.
p400
aVAnd all of our support staff who had talked to her were really emotional,
p401
aVand it was a very hard day at the company.
p402
aa(lp403
VAnd this was one of those instances where I realized
p404
aVhow much blogging affects our relationship,
p405
aVand flattening this sort of world.
p406
aVThat this woman is in England,
p407
aVand she lives \u2014 she lived \u2014 a life
p408
aVwhere she was talking about what she was doing.
p409
aVBut the big thing that really influenced us was,
p410
aVher sister wrote to me, and she said \u2014
p411
aVand she wrote on this blog \u2014
p412
aVthat writing her blog during the last couple of months of her life
p413
aVwas probably the best thing that had happened to her,
p414
aVand being able to talk to people and to share what was going on,
p415
aVand being able to write and receive comments.
p416
aVAnd that was amazing,
p417
aVto be able to know that we had empowered that,
p418
aVand that blogging was something that she felt comfortable doing,
p419
aVand the idea that blogging doesn't have to be scary,
p420
aVthat we don't always have to be attack of the blogs,
p421
aVthat we can be people who are open, and wanting to help and talk to people.
p422
aVThat was an amazing thing.
p423
aa(lp424
VAnd so I printed out and sent a PDF of her blog to her family,
p425
aVand they passed it out at her memorial service,
p426
aVand even in her obituary, they mentioned her blog,
p427
aVbecause it was such a big part of her life.
p428
aVAnd that's a huge thing.
p429
aa(lp430
VSo, this is her legacy,
p431
aVand I think that my call to action to all of you is:
p432
aVthink about blogs, think about what they are,
p433
aVthink about what you've thought of them,
p434
aVand then actually do it,
p435
aVbecause it's something that's really going to change our lives.
p436
aa(lp437
VSo, thank you.
p438
aa(lp439
