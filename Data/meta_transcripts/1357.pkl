VEvery year in the United States alone,
p4
aV2,077,000 couples make a legal and spiritual decision
p5
aVto spend the rest of their lives together \u2014
p6
aa(lp7
V(Laughter)
p8
aa(lp9
VAnd not to have sex with anyone else.
p10
aVEver.
p11
aVHe buys a ring, she buys a dress.
p12
aVThey go shopping for all sorts of things.
p13
aVShe takes him to Arthur Murray for ballroom-dancing lessons.
p14
aVAnd the big day comes.
p15
aVAnd they'll stand before God and family
p16
aVand some guy her dad once did business with,
p17
aVand they'll vow that nothing \u2014
p18
aVnot abject poverty,
p19
aVnot life-threatening illness,
p20
aVnot complete and utter misery \u2014
p21
aVwill ever put the tiniest damper on their eternal love and devotion.
p22
aa(lp23
V(Laughter)
p24
aa(lp25
VThese optimistic young bastards promise to honor and cherish each other
p26
aVthrough hot flashes and midlife crises
p27
aVand a cumulative 50-pound weight gain,
p28
aVuntil that far-off day, when one of them is finally able to rest in peace.
p29
aa(lp30
V(Laughter)
p31
aa(lp32
VYou know, because they can't hear the snoring anymore.
p33
aVAnd then they'll get stupid drunk
p34
aVand smash cake in each other's faces and do the Macarena.
p35
aVAnd we'll be there,
p36
aVshowering them with towels and toasters and drinking their free booze
p37
aVand throwing birdseed at them every single time ...
p38
aVeven though we know, statistically,
p39
aVhalf of them will be divorced within a decade.
p40
aa(lp41
V(Laughter)
p42
aa(lp43
VOf course, the other half won't, right?
p44
aVThey'll keep forgetting anniversaries
p45
aVand arguing about where to spend holidays
p46
aVand debating \u2014
p47
aa(lp48
V(Laughter)
p49
aa(lp50
VWhich way the toilet paper should come off of the roll.
p51
aVAnd some of them will even still be enjoying each other's company
p52
aVwhen neither of them can chew solid food anymore.
p53
aa(lp54
VAnd researchers want to know why.
p55
aVI mean, look \u2014 it doesn't take a double-blind, placebo-controlled study
p56
aVto figure out what makes a marriage not work:
p57
aVdisrespect, boredom,
p58
aVtoo much time on Facebook,
p59
aVhaving sex with other people.
p60
aVBut you can have the exact opposite of all of those things \u2014
p61
aVrespect, excitement,
p62
aVa broken Internet connection,
p63
aVmind-numbing monogamy \u2014
p64
aVand the thing still can go to hell in a handbasket.
p65
aVSo, what's going on when it doesn't?
p66
aVWhat do the folks who make it all the way to side-by-side burial plots
p67
aVhave in common?
p68
aVWhat are they doing right?
p69
aVWhat can we learn from them?
p70
aVAnd if you're still happily sleeping solo,
p71
aVwhy should you stop what you're doing and make it your life's work
p72
aVto find that one special person
p73
aVthat you can annoy for the rest of your life?
p74
aa(lp75
VWell, researchers spend billions of your tax dollars
p76
aVtrying to figure that out.
p77
aVThey stalk blissful couples
p78
aVand study their every move and mannerism.
p79
aVAnd they try to pinpoint what it is that sets them apart
p80
aVfrom their miserable neighbors and friends.
p81
aVAnd it turns out, the success stories share a few similarities,
p82
aVbeyond that they don't have sex with other people.
p83
aa(lp84
VFor instance, in the happiest marriages,
p85
aVthe wife is thinner and better-looking
p86
aVthan the husband.
p87
aa(lp88
V(Laughter)
p89
aa(lp90
VObvious. Right?
p91
aVIt's obvious that this leads to marital bliss,
p92
aVbecause women \u2014 we care a great deal about being thin and good-looking,
p93
aVwhereas men mostly care about sex,
p94
aVideally, with women who are thinner and better looking than they are.
p95
aVThe beauty of this research, though,
p96
aVis that no one is suggesting that women have to be thin to be happy.
p97
aVWe just have to be thinner than our partners.
p98
aVSo instead of all that laborious dieting and exercising,
p99
aVwe just need to wait for them to get fat \u2014
p100
aa(lp101
V(Laughter)
p102
aa(lp103
VMaybe bake a few pies.
p104
aVThis is good information to have, and it's not that complicated.
p105
aa(lp106
V(Laughter)
p107
aa(lp108
VResearch also suggests
p109
aVthat the happiest couples are the ones that focus on the positives.
p110
aVFor example: the happy wife.
p111
aVInstead of pointing out her husband's growing gut
p112
aVor suggesting he go for a run,
p113
aVshe might say,
p114
aV"Wow, honey, thank you for going out of your way
p115
aVto make me relatively thinner."
p116
aa(lp117
V(Laughter)
p118
aa(lp119
VThese are couples who can find good in any situation.
p120
aV"Yeah, it was devastating when we lost everything in that fire.
p121
aVBut it's kind of nice sleeping out here under the stars.
p122
aVAnd it's a good thing you've got all that body fat to keep us warm."
p123
aa(lp124
V(Laughter)
p125
aa(lp126
VOne of my favorite studies found
p127
aVthat the more willing a husband is to do housework,
p128
aVthe more attractive his wife will find him.
p129
aVBecause we needed a study to tell us this.
p130
aa(lp131
V(Laughter)
p132
aa(lp133
VBut here's what's going on here.
p134
aVThe more attractive she finds him, the more sex they have;
p135
aVthe more sex they have, the nicer he is to her;
p136
aVthe nicer he is to her,
p137
aVthe less she nags him about leaving wet towels on the bed,
p138
aVand ultimately, they live happily ever after.
p139
aVIn other words, men, you might want to pick it up a notch
p140
aVin the domestic department.
p141
aa(lp142
VHere's an interesting one.
p143
aVOne study found that people who smile in childhood photographs
p144
aVare less likely to get a divorce.
p145
aVThis is an actual study, and let me clarify:
p146
aVthe researchers were not looking at documented self-reports
p147
aVof childhood happiness,
p148
aVor even studying old journals.
p149
aVThe data were based entirely on whether people looked happy
p150
aVin these early pictures.
p151
aVNow, I don't know how old all of you are, but when I was a kid,
p152
aVyour parents took pictures with a special kind of camera
p153
aVthat held something called "film."
p154
aVAnd, by God, film was expensive.
p155
aVThey didn't take 300 shots of you in that rapid-fire digital video mode
p156
aVand then pick out the nicest, smiliest one for the Christmas card.
p157
aVOh, no.
p158
aVThey dressed you up, they lined you up,
p159
aVand you smiled for the fucking camera like they told you to
p160
aVor you could kiss your birthday party goodbye.
p161
aVBut still, I have a huge pile of fake happy childhood pictures
p162
aVand I'm glad they make me less likely than some people to get a divorce.
p163
aa(lp164
VSo, what else can you do to safeguard your marriage?
p165
aVDo not win an Oscar for best actress.
p166
aa(lp167
V(Laughter)
p168
aa(lp169
VI'm serious.
p170
aVBettie Davis, Joan Crawford, Halle Berry, Hilary Swank,
p171
aVSandra Bullock, Reese Witherspoon \u2014
p172
aVall of them single, soon after taking home that statue.
p173
aVThey actually call it the Oscar curse.
p174
aVIt is the marriage kiss of death and something that should be avoided.
p175
aa(lp176
VAnd it's not just successfully starring in films that's dangerous.
p177
aVIt turns out, merely watching a romantic comedy
p178
aVcauses relationship satisfaction to plummet.
p179
aa(lp180
V(Laughter)
p181
aa(lp182
VApparently, the bitter realization that maybe it could happen to us,
p183
aVbut it obviously hasn't and it probably never will,
p184
aVmakes our lives seem unbearably grim in comparison.
p185
aVAnd theoretically,
p186
aVI suppose if we opt for a film where someone gets brutally murdered
p187
aVor dies in a fiery car crash,
p188
aVwe are more likely to walk out of that theater
p189
aVfeeling like we've got it pretty good.
p190
aa(lp191
V(Laughter)
p192
aa(lp193
VDrinking alcohol, it seems, is bad for your marriage.
p194
aVYeah.
p195
aVI can't tell you anymore about that one
p196
aVbecause I stopped reading it at the headline.
p197
aVBut here's a scary one: divorce is contagious.
p198
aVThat's right, when you have a close couple friend split up,
p199
aVit increases your chances of getting a divorce by 75 percent.
p200
aVNow, I have to say, I don't get this one at all.
p201
aVMy husband and I have watched quite a few friends divide their assets
p202
aVand then struggle with being our age and single
p203
aVin an age of sexting and Viagra and eHarmony.
p204
aVAnd I'm thinking they've done more for my marriage
p205
aVthan a lifetime of therapy ever could.
p206
aa(lp207
VSo now you may be wondering: Why does anyone get married ever?
p208
aVWell, the US federal government counts more than a thousand legal benefits
p209
aVto being someone's spouse.
p210
aVA list that includes visitation rights in jail,
p211
aVbut hopefully, you'll never need that one.
p212
aVBut beyond the profound federal perks,
p213
aVmarried people make more money.
p214
aVWe're healthier, physically and emotionally.
p215
aVWe produce happier, more stable and more successful kids.
p216
aVWe have more sex than our supposedly swinging single friends,
p217
aVbelieve it or not.
p218
aVWe even live longer,
p219
aVwhich is a pretty compelling argument for marrying someone you like a lot
p220
aVin the first place.
p221
aa(lp222
V(Laughter)
p223
aa(lp224
VNow, if you're not currently experiencing the joy of the joint tax return,
p225
aVI can't tell you how to find a chore-loving person
p226
aVof the approximately ideal size and attractiveness,
p227
aVwho prefers horror movies
p228
aVand doesn't have a lot of friends hovering on the brink of divorce,
p229
aVbut I can only encourage you to try,
p230
aVbecause the benefits, as I've pointed out,
p231
aVare significant.
p232
aVThe bottom line is: whether you're in it or you're searching for it,
p233
aVI believe marriage is an institution worth pursuing and protecting.
p234
aVSo I hope you'll use the information I've given you today
p235
aVto weigh your personal strengths against your own risk factors.
p236
aa(lp237
VFor instance, in my marriage, I'd say I'm doing OK.
p238
aVOne the one hand,
p239
aVI have a husband who's annoyingly lean and incredibly handsome.
p240
aVSo I'm obviously going to need fatten him up.
p241
aVAnd like I said, we have those divorced friends
p242
aVwho may secretly or subconsciously be trying to break us up.
p243
aVSo we have to keep an eye on that.
p244
aVAnd we do like a cocktail or two.
p245
aVOn the other hand,
p246
aVI have the fake happy picture thing.
p247
aVAnd also, my husband does a lot around the house,
p248
aVand would happily never see another romantic comedy
p249
aVas long as he lives.
p250
aa(lp251
VSo I've got all those things going for me.
p252
aVBut just in case,
p253
aVI plan to work extra hard to not win an Oscar anytime soon.
p254
aVAnd for the good of your relationships,
p255
aVI would encourage you to do the same.
p256
aVI'll see you at the bar.
p257
