VIn the last couple of years,
p4
aVI have produced what I call "The Dead Mall Series,"
p5
aV32 short films and counting about dead malls.
p6
aVNow, for those of you who are not familiar with what a dead mall is,
p7
aVit's basically a shopping mall
p8
aVthat has fallen into hard times.
p9
aVSo it either has few shops and fewer shoppers,
p10
aVor it's abandoned and crumbling into ruin.
p11
aVNo sale at Penny's.
p12
aa(lp13
V(Laughter)
p14
aa(lp15
VI started producing this series
p16
aVin early 2015
p17
aVafter going through kind of a dark period in my life
p18
aVwhere I just didn't want to create films anymore.
p19
aVI put my camera away
p20
aVand I just stopped.
p21
aVSo in 2015, I decided to make a short film about the Owings Mills Mall.
p22
aVOwings Mills Mall opened in 1986.
p23
aVI should know because I was there on opening day.
p24
aVI was there with my family,
p25
aValong with every other family in Baltimore,
p26
aVand you had to drive around
p27
aVfor 45 minutes
p28
aVjust to find a parking spot.
p29
aVSo if you can imagine,
p30
aVthat's not happening at the malls today.
p31
aa(lp32
VMy first mall job that I had as a teenager
p33
aVwas at a sporting goods store called Herman's World of Sports.
p34
aVMaybe you remember.
p35
aa(lp36
V(Singing) Herman's World of Sports.
p37
aa(lp38
VYou guys remember that?
p39
aa(lp40
V(Laughter)
p41
aa(lp42
VYeah, so I worked in a lady's shoe store.
p43
aVI worked in a leather goods store,
p44
aVand I also worked in a video store,
p45
aVand not being one who was very fond of the retail arts \u2014
p46
aa(lp47
V(Laughter)
p48
aa(lp49
VI got fired from every single job.
p50
aa(lp51
V(Laughter)
p52
aa(lp53
VIn between these low-paying retail jobs,
p54
aVI did what any normal teenager did
p55
aVin the 1990s.
p56
aVI shoplifted.
p57
aVI'm just kidding.
p58
aVI hung out with my friends at the mall.
p59
aa(lp60
V(Laughter)
p61
aa(lp62
VEveryone's like, "Oh my God, what kind of talk is this?"
p63
aa(lp64
V(Laughter)
p65
aa(lp66
VHanging out at the mall could be fun, but it could be really lame, too,
p67
aVlike sharing a cigarette with a 40-year-old unemployed mall rat
p68
aVwho has put on black lipstick for the night
p69
aVwhile you're on your break from your crappy minimum wage job.
p70
aa(lp71
VAs I stand here today,
p72
aVOwings Mills has been gutted
p73
aVand it's ready for the wrecking ball.
p74
aVThe last time I was there, it was in the evening,
p75
aVand it was about three days before they closed the mall for good.
p76
aVAnd you kind of felt \u2014
p77
aVthey never announced the mall was closing,
p78
aVbut you had this sort of feeling, this ominous feeling,
p79
aVthat something big was going to happen,
p80
aVlike it was the end of the road.
p81
aVIt was a very creepy walk through the mall.
p82
aVLet me show you.
p83
aa(lp84
V(Music)
p85
aa(lp86
VSo when I started producing "The Dead Mall Series,"
p87
aVI put the videos up onto YouTube,
p88
aVand while I thought they were interesting,
p89
aVfrankly I didn't think others would share the enthusiasm
p90
aVfor such a drab and depressing topic.
p91
aVBut apparently I was wrong,
p92
aVbecause a lot of people started to comment.
p93
aVAnd at first the comments were like \u2014
p94
aVbasically like, "Oh my God, that's the mall from my childhood.
p95
aVWhat happened?"
p96
aVAnd then I would get comments from people who were like,
p97
aV"There's a dead mall in my town. You should come and film it."
p98
aVSo I started to travel around the mid-Atlantic region
p99
aVfilming these dead malls.
p100
aVSome were open.
p101
aVSome were abandoned.
p102
aVIt was kind of always hard to get into the ones that were abandoned,
p103
aVbut I somehow always found a way in.
p104
aa(lp105
V(Laughter)
p106
aa(lp107
VThe malls that are still open,
p108
aVthey always do this weird thing \u2014 like the dead malls.
p109
aVThey'll have three stores left,
p110
aVbut they try to spruce it up
p111
aVto make it appear like things are on the up-and-up.
p112
aVFor example,
p113
aVyou'll have an empty store
p114
aVand they bring the gate down.
p115
aVSo at Owings Mills, for example, they put this tarp over the gate.
p116
aVRight?
p117
aVAnd it's got a stock photo
p118
aVof a woman who is so happy
p119
aVand she's holding a blouse,
p120
aVand she's like \u2014
p121
aa(lp122
V(Laughter)
p123
aa(lp124
VAnd then there's a guy standing next to her, with, like,
p125
aVan espresso cup, and he's like \u2014
p126
aa(lp127
V(Laughter)
p128
aa(lp129
VAnd it says, "What brings you today?"
p130
aa(lp131
V(Laughter)
p132
aa(lp133
VI wanted to be scared and depressed.
p134
aVThank you.
p135
aa(lp136
VSo the comments just kept pouring in
p137
aVon the videos,
p138
aVfrom all over the country, and then all over the world.
p139
aVAnd I started to think, this could really be something,
p140
aVbut I had to get creative, because I'm like,
p141
aVhow long are people going to sit and watch me waddling through an empty mall?
p142
aa(lp143
V(Laughter)
p144
aa(lp145
VSo the original episodes I filmed with an iPhone.
p146
aVSo I'd walk through the mall with an iPhone, and, you know.
p147
aVLike that.
p148
aa(lp149
V(Laughter)
p150
aa(lp151
VAnd security \u2014 because malls, they don't like photography \u2014
p152
aVso the security would come up and be like, "Put that away," and I'm like, "OK."
p153
aVSo I had to get creative and sneaky,
p154
aVso I started using a hidden camera and different techniques
p155
aVto get the footage that I needed,
p156
aVand basically what I wanted to do
p157
aVwas make the video
p158
aVlike it was a first-person experience,
p159
aVlike you are sitting \u2014
p160
aVput your headphones on watching the screen \u2014
p161
aVit's like, you're there in the video,
p162
aVlike a video game, basically.
p163
aa(lp164
VI also started to use music,
p165
aVcollaborating with artists who create music called vaporwave.
p166
aVAnd vaporwave is a music genre
p167
aVthat emerged in the early 2010s among internet communities.
p168
aVHere's an example.
p169
aa(lp170
V(Music)
p171
aa(lp172
VThat's by an artist named Disconscious
p173
aVfrom an album he did called "Hologram Plaza."
p174
aVSo if you look that up, you can hear more of those tunes.
p175
aVVaporwave is more than an art form. It's like a movement.
p176
aVIt's nihilistic, it's angsty,
p177
aVbut it's somehow comforting.
p178
aVThe whole aesthetic is a way of dealing with things you can't do anything about,
p179
aVlike no jobs, or sitting in your parents' basement eating ramen noodles.
p180
aVVaporwave came out of this generation's desire to express their hopelessness,
p181
aVthe same way that the pre-internet generation did
p182
aVsitting around in the food court.
p183
aa(lp184
VOne of my favorite malls
p185
aVI've been to
p186
aVis in Corpus Christi, and it's called the Sunrise Mall.
p187
aVWhen I was a kid,
p188
aVmy favorite thing to do was watch movies,
p189
aVand I used to watch movies over and over and over again.
p190
aVAnd one of my favorite films was "The Legend of Billie Jean."
p191
aVNow, for those of you who have seen "The Legend of Billie Jean,"
p192
aVyou'll know that it's a great film.
p193
aVI love it.
p194
aVAnd Helen Slater and Christian Slater \u2014
p195
aVand if you didn't know, they are not related.
p196
aVMany people thought that they were brother and sister. They're not.
p197
aVBut anyway, Sunrise Mall was used in the film as a filming location.
p198
aVThe mall is exactly the same as it was in 1984.
p199
aVWe're talking 32 years later. Let me show you.
p200
aa(lp201
V(Video) Dan Bell: And here's Billie Jean running across the fountain,
p202
aVbeing chased by Hubie Pyatt's friends.
p203
aVAnd she jumps over here.
p204
aVAnd you can see the shot right here is what it looks like today.
p205
aVIt's pretty incredible.
p206
aVI mean, honestly, it's exactly the same.
p207
aVAnd there they are falling in the fountain,
p208
aVand she runs up the stairs.
p209
aVThis is a nice shot of the whole thing here.
p210
aa(lp211
VDan Bell: I love that so much.
p212
aa(lp213
V(Laughter)
p214
aa(lp215
VI always think in my head, if I owned a dead mall \u2014
p216
aVwhy don't they embrace their vintage look?
p217
aVPut in a bar,
p218
aVlike, put vegan food in the food court
p219
aVand invite millennials and hipsters
p220
aVto come and drink and eat,
p221
aVand I guarantee you within three weeks
p222
aVH&M and Levi's will be banging on the door trying to get space.
p223
aVI don't know why they don't do this,
p224
aVbut apparently,
p225
aVit's only in my mind, it goes all day.
p226
aa(lp227
V(Laughter)
p228
aa(lp229
VAnyway, in closing \u2014
p230
aa(lp231
V(Laughter)
p232
aa(lp233
VWhen they first asked me to do this talk,
p234
aVI said,
p235
aV"Do you have the right person?"
p236
aa(lp237
V(Laughter)
p238
aa(lp239
VThese talks are supposed to be kind of inspiring and \u2014
p240
aa(lp241
V(Laughter)
p242
aa(lp243
VI remembered something, though.
p244
aVI put my camera down three or four years ago,
p245
aVand it took going to these malls
p246
aVfor me to be inspired again.
p247
aVAnd to see my audience
p248
aVand people from all over the world writing me and saying,
p249
aV"God, I love your videos,"
p250
aVis incredible.
p251
aVI don't know how to even explain it,
p252
aVas an artist,
p253
aVhow fulfilling that is.
p254
aVIf you would have told me a year ago
p255
aVthat I would be standing on this stage
p256
aVtalking to all of you wonderful people,
p257
aVI would have never believed it.
p258
aVI am humbled
p259
aVand so appreciative.
p260
aa(lp261
VThank you very much.
