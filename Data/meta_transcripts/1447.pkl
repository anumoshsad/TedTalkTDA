VI'm going to talk to you about optimism \u2014
p4
aVor more precisely, the optimism bias.
p5
aVIt's a cognitive illusion
p6
aVthat we've been studying in my lab for the past few years,
p7
aVand 80 percent of us have it.
p8
aa(lp9
VIt's our tendency to overestimate
p10
aVour likelihood of experiencing good events in our lives
p11
aVand underestimate our likelihood of experiencing bad events.
p12
aVSo we underestimate our likelihood of suffering from cancer,
p13
aVbeing in a car accident.
p14
aVWe overestimate our longevity, our career prospects.
p15
aVIn short, we're more optimistic than realistic,
p16
aVbut we are oblivious to the fact.
p17
aa(lp18
VTake marriage for example.
p19
aVIn the Western world, divorce rates are about 40 percent.
p20
aVThat means that out of five married couples,
p21
aVtwo will end up splitting their assets.
p22
aVBut when you ask newlyweds about their own likelihood of divorce,
p23
aVthey estimate it at zero percent.
p24
aVAnd even divorce lawyers, who should really know better,
p25
aVhugely underestimate their own likelihood of divorce.
p26
aVSo it turns out that optimists are not less likely to divorce,
p27
aVbut they are more likely to remarry.
p28
aVIn the words of Samuel Johnson,
p29
aV"Remarriage is the triumph of hope over experience."
p30
aa(lp31
V(Laughter)
p32
aa(lp33
VSo if we're married, we're more likely to have kids.
p34
aVAnd we all think our kids will be especially talented.
p35
aVThis, by the way, is my two-year-old nephew, Guy.
p36
aVAnd I just want to make it absolutely clear
p37
aVthat he's a really bad example of the optimism bias,
p38
aVbecause he is in fact uniquely talented.
p39
aa(lp40
V(Laughter)
p41
aa(lp42
VAnd I'm not alone.
p43
aVOut of four British people, three said
p44
aVthat they were optimistic about the future of their own families.
p45
aVThat's 75 percent.
p46
aVBut only 30 percent said
p47
aVthat they thought families in general
p48
aVare doing better than a few generations ago.
p49
aa(lp50
VAnd this is a really important point,
p51
aVbecause we're optimistic about ourselves,
p52
aVwe're optimistic about our kids,
p53
aVwe're optimistic about our families,
p54
aVbut we're not so optimistic about the guy sitting next to us,
p55
aVand we're somewhat pessimistic
p56
aVabout the fate of our fellow citizens and the fate of our country.
p57
aVBut private optimism about our own personal future
p58
aVremains persistent.
p59
aVAnd it doesn't mean that we think things will magically turn out okay,
p60
aVbut rather that we have the unique ability to make it so.
p61
aa(lp62
VNow I'm a scientist, I do experiments.
p63
aVSo to show you what I mean,
p64
aVI'm going to do an experiment here with you.
p65
aVSo I'm going to give you a list of abilities and characteristics,
p66
aVand I want you to think for each of these abilities
p67
aVwhere you stand relative to the rest of the population.
p68
aa(lp69
VThe first one is getting along well with others.
p70
aVWho here believes they're at the bottom 25 percent?
p71
aVOkay, that's about 10 people out of 1,500.
p72
aVWho believes they're at the top 25 percent?
p73
aVThat's most of us here.
p74
aVOkay, now do the same for your driving ability.
p75
aVHow interesting are you?
p76
aVHow attractive are you?
p77
aVHow honest are you?
p78
aVAnd finally, how modest are you?
p79
aa(lp80
VSo most of us put ourselves above average
p81
aVon most of these abilities.
p82
aVNow this is statistically impossible.
p83
aVWe can't all be better than everyone else.
p84
aV(Laughter)
p85
aVBut if we believe we're better than the other guy,
p86
aVwell that means that we're more likely to get that promotion, to remain married,
p87
aVbecause we're more social, more interesting.
p88
aa(lp89
VAnd it's a global phenomenon.
p90
aVThe optimism bias has been observed
p91
aVin many different countries \u2014
p92
aVin Western cultures, in non-Western cultures,
p93
aVin females and males,
p94
aVin kids, in the elderly.
p95
aVIt's quite widespread.
p96
aa(lp97
VBut the question is, is it good for us?
p98
aVSo some people say no.
p99
aVSome people say the secret to happiness
p100
aVis low expectations.
p101
aVI think the logic goes something like this:
p102
aVIf we don't expect greatness,
p103
aVif we don't expect to find love and be healthy and successful,
p104
aVwell we're not going to be disappointed when these things don't happen.
p105
aVAnd if we're not disappointed when good things don't happen,
p106
aVand we're pleasantly surprised when they do,
p107
aVwe will be happy.
p108
aa(lp109
VSo it's a very good theory,
p110
aVbut it turns out to be wrong for three reasons.
p111
aVNumber one: Whatever happens, whether you succeed or you fail,
p112
aVpeople with high expectations always feel better.
p113
aVBecause how we feel when we get dumped or win employee of the month
p114
aVdepends on how we interpret that event.
p115
aa(lp116
VThe psychologists Margaret Marshall and John Brown
p117
aVstudied students with high and low expectations.
p118
aVAnd they found that when people with high expectations succeed,
p119
aVthey attribute that success to their own traits.
p120
aV"I'm a genius, therefore I got an A,
p121
aVtherefore I'll get an A again and again in the future."
p122
aVWhen they failed, it wasn't because they were dumb,
p123
aVbut because the exam just happened to be unfair.
p124
aVNext time they will do better.
p125
aVPeople with low expectations do the opposite.
p126
aVSo when they failed it was because they were dumb,
p127
aVand when they succeeded
p128
aVit was because the exam just happened to be really easy.
p129
aVNext time reality would catch up with them.
p130
aVSo they felt worse.
p131
aa(lp132
VNumber two: Regardless of the outcome,
p133
aVthe pure act of anticipation makes us happy.
p134
aVThe behavioral economist George Lowenstein
p135
aVasked students in his university
p136
aVto imagine getting a passionate kiss from a celebrity, any celebrity.
p137
aVThen he said, "How much are you willing to pay
p138
aVto get a kiss from a celebrity
p139
aVif the kiss was delivered immediately,
p140
aVin three hours, in 24 hours, in three days,
p141
aVin one year, in 10 years?
p142
aVHe found that the students were willing to pay the most
p143
aVnot to get a kiss immediately,
p144
aVbut to get a kiss in three days.
p145
aVThey were willing to pay extra in order to wait.
p146
aVNow they weren't willing to wait a year or 10 years;
p147
aVno one wants an aging celebrity.
p148
aVBut three days seemed to be the optimum amount.
p149
aa(lp150
VSo why is that?
p151
aVWell if you get the kiss now, it's over and done with.
p152
aVBut if you get the kiss in three days,
p153
aVwell that's three days of jittery anticipation, the thrill of the wait.
p154
aVThe students wanted that time
p155
aVto imagine where is it going to happen,
p156
aVhow is it going to happen.
p157
aVAnticipation made them happy.
p158
aa(lp159
VThis is, by the way, why people prefer Friday to Sunday.
p160
aVIt's a really curious fact,
p161
aVbecause Friday is a day of work and Sunday is a day of pleasure,
p162
aVso you'd assume that people will prefer Sunday,
p163
aVbut they don't.
p164
aVIt's not because they really, really like being in the office
p165
aVand they can't stand strolling in the park
p166
aVor having a lazy brunch.
p167
aVWe know that, because when you ask people
p168
aVabout their ultimate favorite day of the week,
p169
aVsurprise, surprise, Saturday comes in at first,
p170
aVthen Friday, then Sunday.
p171
aVPeople prefer Friday
p172
aVbecause Friday brings with it the anticipation of the weekend ahead,
p173
aVall the plans that you have.
p174
aVOn Sunday, the only thing you can look forward to
p175
aVis the work week.
p176
aa(lp177
VSo optimists are people who expect more kisses in their future,
p178
aVmore strolls in the park.
p179
aVAnd that anticipation enhances their wellbeing.
p180
aVIn fact, without the optimism bias,
p181
aVwe would all be slightly depressed.
p182
aVPeople with mild depression,
p183
aVthey don't have a bias when they look into the future.
p184
aVThey're actually more realistic than healthy individuals.
p185
aVBut individuals with severe depression,
p186
aVthey have a pessimistic bias.
p187
aVSo they tend to expect the future
p188
aVto be worse than it ends up being.
p189
aa(lp190
VSo optimism changes subjective reality.
p191
aVThe way we expect the world to be changes the way we see it.
p192
aVBut it also changes objective reality.
p193
aVIt acts as a self-fulfilling prophecy.
p194
aVAnd that is the third reason
p195
aVwhy lowering your expectations will not make you happy.
p196
aVControlled experiments have shown
p197
aVthat optimism is not only related to success,
p198
aVit leads to success.
p199
aVOptimism leads to success in academia and sports and politics.
p200
aVAnd maybe the most surprising benefit of optimism is health.
p201
aVIf we expect the future to be bright,
p202
aVstress and anxiety are reduced.
p203
aa(lp204
VSo all in all, optimism has lots of benefits.
p205
aVBut the question that was really confusing to me was,
p206
aVhow do we maintain optimism in the face of reality?
p207
aVAs an neuroscientist, this was especially confusing,
p208
aVbecause according to all the theories out there,
p209
aVwhen your expectations are not met, you should alter them.
p210
aVBut this is not what we find.
p211
aVWe asked people to come into our lab
p212
aVin order to try and figure out what was going on.
p213
aa(lp214
VWe asked them to estimate their likelihood
p215
aVof experiencing different terrible events in their lives.
p216
aVSo, for example, what is your likelihood of suffering from cancer?
p217
aVAnd then we told them the average likelihood
p218
aVof someone like them to suffer these misfortunes.
p219
aVSo cancer, for example, is about 30 percent.
p220
aVAnd then we asked them again,
p221
aV"How likely are you to suffer from cancer?"
p222
aa(lp223
VWhat we wanted to know was
p224
aVwhether people will take the information that we gave them
p225
aVto change their beliefs.
p226
aVAnd indeed they did \u2014
p227
aVbut mostly when the information we gave them
p228
aVwas better than what they expected.
p229
aVSo for example,
p230
aVif someone said, "My likelihood of suffering from cancer
p231
aVis about 50 percent,"
p232
aVand we said, "Hey, good news.
p233
aVThe average likelihood is only 30 percent,"
p234
aVthe next time around they would say,
p235
aV"Well maybe my likelihood is about 35 percent."
p236
aVSo they learned quickly and efficiently.
p237
aVBut if someone started off saying,
p238
aV"My average likelihood of suffering from cancer is about 10 percent,"
p239
aVand we said, "Hey, bad news.
p240
aVThe average likelihood is about 30 percent,"
p241
aVthe next time around they would say,
p242
aV"Yep. Still think it's about 11 percent."
p243
aa(lp244
V(Laughter)
p245
aa(lp246
VSo it's not that they didn't learn at all \u2014 they did \u2014
p247
aVbut much, much less than when we gave them
p248
aVpositive information about the future.
p249
aVAnd it's not that they didn't remember the numbers that we gave them;
p250
aVeveryone remembers that the average likelihood of cancer
p251
aVis about 30 percent
p252
aVand the average likelihood of divorce is about 40 percent.
p253
aVBut they didn't think that those numbers were related to them.
p254
aa(lp255
VWhat this means is that warning signs such as these
p256
aVmay only have limited impact.
p257
aVYes, smoking kills, but mostly it kills the other guy.
p258
aa(lp259
VWhat I wanted to know was
p260
aVwhat was going on inside the human brain
p261
aVthat prevented us from taking these warning signs personally.
p262
aVBut at the same time,
p263
aVwhen we hear that the housing market is hopeful,
p264
aVwe think, "Oh, my house is definitely going to double in price."
p265
aVTo try and figure that out,
p266
aVI asked the participants in the experiment
p267
aVto lie in a brain imaging scanner.
p268
aVIt looks like this.
p269
aVAnd using a method called functional MRI,
p270
aVwe were able to identify regions in the brain
p271
aVthat were responding to positive information.
p272
aa(lp273
VOne of these regions is called the left inferior frontal gyrus.
p274
aVSo if someone said, "My likelihood of suffering from cancer is 50 percent,"
p275
aVand we said, "Hey, good news.
p276
aVAverage likelihood is 30 percent,"
p277
aVthe left inferior frontal gyrus would respond fiercely.
p278
aVAnd it didn't matter if you're an extreme optimist, a mild optimist
p279
aVor slightly pessimistic,
p280
aVeveryone's left inferior frontal gyrus
p281
aVwas functioning perfectly well,
p282
aVwhether you're Barack Obama or Woody Allen.
p283
aa(lp284
VOn the other side of the brain,
p285
aVthe right inferior frontal gyrus was responding to bad news.
p286
aVAnd here's the thing: it wasn't doing a very good job.
p287
aVThe more optimistic you were,
p288
aVthe less likely this region was
p289
aVto respond to unexpected negative information.
p290
aVAnd if your brain is failing
p291
aVat integrating bad news about the future,
p292
aVyou will constantly leave your rose-tinted spectacles on.
p293
aa(lp294
VSo we wanted to know, could we change this?
p295
aVCould we alter people's optimism bias
p296
aVby interfering with the brain activity in these regions?
p297
aVAnd there's a way for us to do that.
p298
aa(lp299
VThis is my collaborator Ryota Kanai.
p300
aVAnd what he's doing is he's passing a small magnetic pulse
p301
aVthrough the skull of the participant in our study
p302
aVinto their inferior frontal gyrus.
p303
aVAnd by doing that,
p304
aVhe's interfering with the activity of this brain region
p305
aVfor about half an hour.
p306
aVAfter that everything goes back to normal, I assure you.
p307
aa(lp308
V(Laughter)
p309
aa(lp310
VSo let's see what happens.
p311
aVFirst of all, I'm going to show you
p312
aVthe average amount of bias that we see.
p313
aVSo if I was to test all of you now,
p314
aVthis is the amount that you would learn
p315
aVmore from good news relative to bad news.
p316
aVNow we interfere with the region
p317
aVthat we found to integrate negative information in this task,
p318
aVand the optimism bias grew even larger.
p319
aVWe made people more biased in the way that they process information.
p320
aVThen we interfered with the brain region
p321
aVthat we found to integrate good news in this task,
p322
aVand the optimism bias disappeared.
p323
aVWe were quite amazed by these results
p324
aVbecause we were able to eliminate
p325
aVa deep-rooted bias in humans.
p326
aa(lp327
VAnd at this point we stopped and we asked ourselves,
p328
aVwould we want to shatter the optimism illusion into tiny little bits?
p329
aVIf we could do that, would we want to take people's optimism bias away?
p330
aVWell I've already told you about all of the benefits of the optimism bias,
p331
aVwhich probably makes you want to hold onto it for dear life.
p332
aVBut there are, of course, pitfalls,
p333
aVand it would be really foolish of us to ignore them.
p334
aa(lp335
VTake for example this email I recieved
p336
aVfrom a firefighter here in California.
p337
aVHe says, "Fatality investigations for firefighters
p338
aVoften include 'We didn't think the fire was going to do that,'
p339
aVeven when all of the available information
p340
aVwas there to make safe decisions."
p341
aVThis captain is going to use our findings on the optimism bias
p342
aVto try to explain to the firefighters
p343
aVwhy they think the way they do,
p344
aVto make them acutely aware of this very optimistic bias in humans.
p345
aa(lp346
VSo unrealistic optimism can lead to risky behavior,
p347
aVto financial collapse, to faulty planning.
p348
aVThe British government, for example,
p349
aVhas acknowledged that the optimism bias
p350
aVcan make individuals more likely
p351
aVto underestimate the costs and durations of projects.
p352
aVSo they have adjusted the 2012 Olympic budget
p353
aVfor the optimism bias.
p354
aa(lp355
VMy friend who's getting married in a few weeks
p356
aVhas done the same for his wedding budget.
p357
aVAnd by the way, when I asked him about his own likelihood of divorce,
p358
aVhe said he was quite sure it was zero percent.
p359
aa(lp360
VSo what we would really like to do,
p361
aVis we would like to protect ourselves from the dangers of optimism,
p362
aVbut at the same time remain hopeful,
p363
aVbenefiting from the many fruits of optimism.
p364
aVAnd I believe there's a way for us to do that.
p365
aVThe key here really is knowledge.
p366
aVWe're not born with an innate understanding of our biases.
p367
aVThese have to be identified by scientific investigation.
p368
aVBut the good news is that becoming aware of the optimism bias
p369
aVdoes not shatter the illusion.
p370
aVIt's like visual illusions,
p371
aVin which understanding them does not make them go away.
p372
aVAnd this is good because it means
p373
aVwe should be able to strike a balance,
p374
aVto come up with plans and rules
p375
aVto protect ourselves from unrealistic optimism,
p376
aVbut at the same time remain hopeful.
p377
aa(lp378
VI think this cartoon portrays it nicely.
p379
aVBecause if you're one of these pessimistic penguins up there
p380
aVwho just does not believe they can fly,
p381
aVyou certainly never will.
p382
aVBecause to make any kind of progress,
p383
aVwe need to be able to imagine a different reality,
p384
aVand then we need to believe that that reality is possible.
p385
aVBut if you are an extreme optimistic penguin
p386
aVwho just jumps down blindly hoping for the best,
p387
aVyou might find yourself in a bit of a mess when you hit the ground.
p388
aVBut if you're an optimistic penguin
p389
aVwho believes they can fly,
p390
aVbut then adjusts a parachute to your back
p391
aVjust in case things don't work out exactly as you had planned,
p392
aVyou will soar like an eagle,
p393
aVeven if you're just a penguin.
p394
aa(lp395
VThank you.
