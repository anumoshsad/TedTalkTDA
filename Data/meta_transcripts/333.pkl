VI'm going to try and explain why it is that perhaps
p4
aVwe don't understand as much as we think we do.
p5
aVI'd like to begin with four questions.
p6
aVThis is not some sort of cultural thing for the time of year.
p7
aVThat's an in-joke, by the way.
p8
aVBut these four questions, actually,
p9
aVare ones that people who even know quite a lot about science find quite hard.
p10
aVAnd they're questions that I've asked of science television producers,
p11
aVof audiences of science educators \u2014
p12
aVso that's science teachers \u2014 and also of seven-year-olds,
p13
aVand I find that the seven-year-olds do marginally better
p14
aVthan the other audiences, which is somewhat surprising.
p15
aa(lp16
VSo the first question, and you might want to write this down,
p17
aVeither on a bit of paper, physically, or a virtual piece of paper
p18
aVin your head. And, for viewers at home, you can try this as well.
p19
aVA little seed weighs next to nothing and a tree weighs a lot, right?
p20
aVI think we agree on that. Where does the tree get the stuff that makes up this chair,
p21
aVright? Where does all this stuff come from?
p22
aV(Knocks)
p23
aa(lp24
VAnd your next question is, can you light a little torch-bulb
p25
aVwith a battery, a bulb and one piece of wire?
p26
aVAnd would you be able to, kind of, draw a \u2014 you don't have to draw
p27
aVthe diagram, but would you be able to draw the diagram,
p28
aVif you had to do it? Or would you just say,
p29
aVthat's actually not possible?
p30
aa(lp31
VThe third question is, why is it hotter in summer than in winter?
p32
aVI think we can probably agree that it is hotter in summer than in winter,
p33
aVbut why? And finally, would you be able to \u2014
p34
aVand you can sort of scribble it, if you like \u2014
p35
aVscribble a plan diagram of the solar system,
p36
aVshowing the shape of the planets' orbits?
p37
aVWould you be able to do that?
p38
aVAnd if you can, just scribble a pattern.
p39
aa(lp40
VOK. Now, children get their ideas not from teachers,
p41
aVas teachers often think, but actually from common sense,
p42
aVfrom experience of the world around them,
p43
aVfrom all the things that go on between them and their peers,
p44
aVand their carers, and their parents, and all of that. Experience.
p45
aVAnd one of the great experts in this field, of course, was, bless him,
p46
aVCardinal Wolsey. Be very careful what you get into people's heads
p47
aVbecause it's virtually impossible to shift it afterwards, right?
p48
aV(Laughter)
p49
aVI'm not quite sure how he died, actually.
p50
aVWas he beheaded in the end, or hung?
p51
aV(Laughter)
p52
aVNow, those questions, which, of course, you've got right,
p53
aVand you haven't been conferring, and so on.
p54
aVAnd I \u2014 you know, normally, I would pick people out and humiliate,
p55
aVbut maybe not in this instance.
p56
aa(lp57
VA little seed weighs a lot and, basically, all this stuff,
p58
aV99 percent of this stuff, came out of the air.
p59
aVNow, I guarantee that about 85 percent of you, or maybe it's fewer at TED,
p60
aVwill have said it comes out of the ground. And some people,
p61
aVprobably two of you, will come up and argue with me afterwards,
p62
aVand say that actually, it comes out of the ground.
p63
aVNow, if that was true, we'd have trucks going round the country,
p64
aVfilling people's gardens in with soil, it'd be a fantastic business.
p65
aVBut, actually, we don't do that.
p66
aVThe mass of this comes out of the air.
p67
aVNow, I passed all my biology exams in Britain.
p68
aVI passed them really well, but I still came out of school
p69
aVthinking that that stuff came out of the ground.
p70
aa(lp71
VSecond one: can you light a little torch-bulb with a battery bulb and one piece of wire?
p72
aVYes, you can, and I'll show you in a second how to do that.
p73
aVNow, I have some rather bad news,
p74
aVwhich is that I had a piece of video that I was about to show you,
p75
aVwhich unfortunately \u2014 the sound doesn't work in this room,
p76
aVso I'm going to describe to you, in true "Monty Python" fashion,
p77
aVwhat happens in the video. And in the video, a group of researchers
p78
aVgo to MIT on graduation day.
p79
aVWe chose MIT because, obviously, that's a very long way away
p80
aVfrom here, and you wouldn't mind too much,
p81
aVbut it sort of works the same way in Britain
p82
aVand in the West Coast of the USA.
p83
aVAnd we asked them these questions, and we asked those questions
p84
aVof science graduates, and they couldn't answer them.
p85
aVAnd so, there's a whole lot of people saying,
p86
aV"I'd be very surprised if you told me that this came out of the air.
p87
aVThat's very surprising to me." And those are science graduates.
p88
aVAnd we intercut it with, "We are the premier science university in the world,"
p89
aVbecause of British-like hubris.
p90
aV(Laughter)
p91
aVAnd when we gave graduate engineers that question,
p92
aVthey said it couldn't be done.
p93
aVAnd when we gave them a battery, and a piece of wire, and a bulb,
p94
aVand said, "Can you do it?" They couldn't do it. Right?
p95
aVAnd that's no different from Imperial College in London, by the way,
p96
aVit's not some sort of anti-American thing going on.
p97
aa(lp98
VAs if. Now, the reason this matters is we pay lots and lots of money
p99
aVfor teaching people \u2014 we might as well get it right.
p100
aVAnd there are also some societal reasons
p101
aVwhy we might want people to understand what it is that's happening
p102
aVin photosynthesis. For example, one half of the carbon equation
p103
aVis how much we emit, and the other half of the carbon equation,
p104
aVas I'm very conscious as a trustee of Kew,
p105
aVis how much things soak up, and they soak up carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.
p106
aVThat's what plants actually do for a living.
p107
aVAnd, for any Finnish people in the audience, this is a Finnish pun:
p108
aVwe are, both literally and metaphorically, skating on thin ice
p109
aVif we don't understand that kind of thing.
p110
aVNow, here's how you do the battery and the bulb.
p111
aVIt's so easy, isn't it? Of course, you all knew that.
p112
aVBut if you haven't played with a battery and a bulb,
p113
aVif you've only seen a circuit diagram,
p114
aVyou might not be able to do that, and that's one of the problems.
p115
aa(lp116
VSo, why is it hotter in summer than in winter?
p117
aVWe learn, as children, that you get closer to something that's hot,
p118
aVand it burns you. It's a very powerful bit of learning,
p119
aVand it happens pretty early on.
p120
aVBy extension, we think to ourselves, "Why it's hotter in summer than in winter
p121
aVmust be because we're closer to the Sun."
p122
aVI promise you that most of you will have got that.
p123
aVOh, you're all shaking your heads,
p124
aVbut only a few of you are shaking your heads very firmly.
p125
aVOther ones are kind of going like this. All right.
p126
aVIt's hotter in summer than in winter because the rays from the Sun
p127
aVare spread out more, right, because of the tilt of the Earth.
p128
aVAnd if you think the tilt is tilting us closer, no, it isn't.
p129
aVThe Sun is 93 million miles away, and we're tilting like this, right?
p130
aVIt makes no odds. In fact, in the Northern Hemisphere,
p131
aVwe're further from the Sun in summer,
p132
aVas it happens, but it makes no odds, the difference.
p133
aa(lp134
VOK, now, the scribble of the diagram of the solar system.
p135
aVIf you believe, as most of you probably do,
p136
aVthat it's hotter in summer than in winter because we're closer to the Sun,
p137
aVyou must have drawn an ellipse.
p138
aVRight? That would explain it, right?
p139
aVExcept, in your \u2014 you're nodding \u2014 now, in your ellipse,
p140
aVhave you thought, "Well, what happens during the night?"
p141
aVBetween Australia and here, right, they've got summer
p142
aVand we've got winter, and what \u2014
p143
aVdoes the Earth kind of rush towards the Sun at night,
p144
aVand then rush back again? I mean, it's a very strange thing going on,
p145
aVand we hold these two models in our head, of what's right and what isn't right,
p146
aVand we do that, as human beings, in all sorts of fields.
p147
aa(lp148
VSo, here's Copernicus' view of what the solar system looked like as a plan.
p149
aVThat's pretty much what you should have on your piece of paper. Right?
p150
aVAnd this is NASA's view. They're stunningly similar.
p151
aVI hope you notice the coincidence here.
p152
aVWhat would you do if you knew that people had this misconception,
p153
aVright, in their heads, of elliptical orbits
p154
aVcaused by our experiences as children?
p155
aVWhat sort of diagram would you show them of the solar system,
p156
aVto show that it's not really like that?
p157
aVYou'd show them something like this, wouldn't you?
p158
aVIt's a plan, looking down from above.
p159
aVBut, no, look what I found in the textbooks.
p160
aVThat's what you show people, right? These are from textbooks,
p161
aVfrom websites, educational websites \u2014
p162
aVand almost anything you pick up is like that.
p163
aVAnd the reason it's like that is because it's dead boring
p164
aVto have a load of concentric circles,
p165
aVwhereas that's much more exciting, to look at something at that angle,
p166
aVisn't it? Right? And by doing it at that angle,
p167
aVif you've got that misconception in your head, then that
p168
aVtwo-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional thing will be ellipses.
p169
aVSo you've \u2014 it's crap, isn't it really? As we say.
p170
aVSo, these mental models \u2014 we look for evidence that reinforces our models.
p171
aVWe do this, of course, with matters of race, and politics, and everything else,
p172
aVand we do it in science as well. So we look, just look \u2014
p173
aVand scientists do it, constantly \u2014 we look for evidence
p174
aVthat reinforces our models, and some folks are just all too able
p175
aVand willing to provide the evidence that reinforces the models.
p176
aa(lp177
VSo, being I'm in the United States, I'll have a dig at the Europeans.
p178
aVThese are examples of what I would say is bad practice in science
p179
aVteaching centers. These pictures are from La Villette in France
p180
aVand the welcome wing of the Science Museum in London.
p181
aVAnd, if you look at the, kind of the way these things are constructed,
p182
aVthere's a lot of mediation by glass, and it's very blue, and kind of professional \u2014
p183
aVin that way that, you know, Woody Allen comes up
p184
aVfrom under the sheets in that scene in "Annie Hall,"
p185
aVand said, "God, that's so professional." And that you don't \u2014
p186
aVthere's no passion in it, and it's not hands on, right,
p187
aVand, you know, pun intended. Whereas good interpretation \u2014
p188
aVI'll use an example from nearby \u2014 is San Francisco Exploratorium,
p189
aVwhere all the things that \u2014 the demonstrations, and so on,
p190
aVare made out of everyday objects that children can understand,
p191
aVit's very hands-on, and they can engage with, and experiment with.
p192
aVAnd I know that if the graduates at MIT
p193
aVand in the Imperial College in London had had the battery and the wire
p194
aVand the bit of stuff, and you know, been able to do it,
p195
aVthey would have learned how it actually works,
p196
aVrather than thinking that they follow circuit diagrams and can't do it.
p197
aVSo good interpretation is more about
p198
aVthings that are bodged and stuffed and of my world, right?
p199
aVAnd things that \u2014 where there isn't an extra barrier
p200
aVof a piece of glass or machined titanium,
p201
aVand it all looks fantastic, OK?
p202
aVAnd the Exploratorium does that really, really well.
p203
aVAnd it's amateur, but amateur in the best sense,
p204
aVin other words, the root of the word being of love and passion.
p205
aa(lp206
VSo, children are not empty vessels, OK?
p207
aVSo, as "Monty Python" would have it,
p208
aVthis is a bit Lord Privy Seal to say so,
p209
aVbut this is \u2014 children are not empty vessels.
p210
aVThey come with their own ideas and their own theories,
p211
aVand unless you work with those, then you won't be able to shift them,
p212
aVright? And I probably haven't shifted your ideas
p213
aVof how the world and universe operates, either.
p214
aVBut this applies, equally, to matters of trying to sell new technology.
p215
aVFor example, we are, in Britain, we're trying to do a digital switchover
p216
aVof the whole population into digital technology [for television].
p217
aVAnd it's one of the difficult things
p218
aVis that when people have preconceptions of how it all works,
p219
aVit's quite difficult to shift those.
p220
aVSo we're not empty vessels; the mental models that we have
p221
aVas children persist into adulthood.
p222
aVPoor teaching actually does more harm than good.
p223
aVIn this country and in Britain, magnetism is understood better
p224
aVby children before they've been to school than afterwards, OK?
p225
aVSame for gravity, two concepts, so it's \u2014 which is quite humbling,
p226
aVas a, you know, if you're a teacher, and you look before and after,
p227
aVthat's quite worrying. They do worse in tests afterwards, after the teaching.
p228
aVAnd we collude. We design tests,
p229
aVor at least in Britain, so that people pass them. Right?
p230
aVAnd governments do very well. They pat themselves on the back.
p231
aVOK? We collude, and actually if you \u2014
p232
aVif someone had designed a test for me
p233
aVwhen I was doing my biology exams,
p234
aVto really understand, to see whether I'd understood
p235
aVmore than just kind of putting starch and iodine together
p236
aVand seeing it go blue,
p237
aVand really understood that plants took their mass out of the air,
p238
aVthen I might have done better at science.
p239
aVSo the most important thing is to get people to articulate their models.
p240
aa(lp241
VYour homework is \u2014 you know, how does an aircraft's wing create lift?
p242
aVAn obvious question, and you'll have an answer now in your heads.
p243
aVAnd the second question to that then is,
p244
aVensure you've explained how it is that planes can fly upside down.
p245
aVAh ha, right. Second question is, why is the sea blue? All right?
p246
aVAnd you've all got an idea in your head of the answer.
p247
aVSo, why is it blue on cloudy days? Ah, see.
p248
aV(Laughter)
p249
aVI've always wanted to say that in this country.
p250
aV(Laughter)
p251
aVFinally, my plea to you is to allow yourselves, and your children,
p252
aVand anyone you know, to kind of fiddle with stuff,
p253
aVbecause it's by fiddling with things that you, you know,
p254
aVyou complement your other learning. It's not a replacement,
p255
aVit's just part of learning that's important.
p256
aVThank you very much.
p257
aVNow \u2014 oh, oh yeah, go on then, go on.
