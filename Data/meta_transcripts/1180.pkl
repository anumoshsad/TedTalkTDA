VI'd like to begin with a thought experiment.
p4
aVImagine that it's 4,000 years into the future.
p5
aVCivilization as we know it
p6
aVhas ceased to exist \u2014
p7
aVno books,
p8
aVno electronic devices,
p9
aVno Facebook or Twitter.
p10
aVAll knowledge of the English language and the English alphabet
p11
aVhas been lost.
p12
aVNow imagine archeologists
p13
aVdigging through the rubble of one of our cities.
p14
aVWhat might they find?
p15
aVWell perhaps some rectangular pieces of plastic
p16
aVwith strange symbols on them.
p17
aVPerhaps some circular pieces of metal.
p18
aVMaybe some cylindrical containers
p19
aVwith some symbols on them.
p20
aVAnd perhaps one archeologist becomes an instant celebrity
p21
aVwhen she discovers \u2014
p22
aVburied in the hills somewhere in North America \u2014
p23
aVmassive versions of these same symbols.
p24
aVNow let's ask ourselves,
p25
aVwhat could such artifacts say about us
p26
aVto people 4,000 years into the future?
p27
aa(lp28
VThis is no hypothetical question.
p29
aVIn fact, this is exactly the kind of question we're faced with
p30
aVwhen we try to understand the Indus Valley civilization,
p31
aVwhich existed 4,000 years ago.
p32
aVThe Indus civilization was roughly contemporaneous
p33
aVwith the much better known Egyptian and the Mesopotamian civilizations,
p34
aVbut it was actually much larger than either of these two civilizations.
p35
aVIt occupied the area
p36
aVof approximately one million square kilometers,
p37
aVcovering what is now Pakistan,
p38
aVNorthwestern India
p39
aVand parts of Afghanistan and Iran.
p40
aVGiven that it was such a vast civilization,
p41
aVyou might expect to find really powerful rulers, kings,
p42
aVand huge monuments glorifying these powerful kings.
p43
aVIn fact,
p44
aVwhat archeologists have found is none of that.
p45
aVThey've found small objects such as these.
p46
aa(lp47
VHere's an example of one of these objects.
p48
aVWell obviously this is a replica.
p49
aVBut who is this person?
p50
aVA king? A god?
p51
aVA priest?
p52
aVOr perhaps an ordinary person
p53
aVlike you or me?
p54
aVWe don't know.
p55
aVBut the Indus people also left behind artifacts with writing on them.
p56
aVWell no, not pieces of plastic,
p57
aVbut stone seals, copper tablets,
p58
aVpottery and, surprisingly,
p59
aVone large sign board,
p60
aVwhich was found buried near the gate of a city.
p61
aVNow we don't know if it says Hollywood,
p62
aVor even Bollywood for that matter.
p63
aVIn fact, we don't even know
p64
aVwhat any of these objects say,
p65
aVand that's because the Indus script is undeciphered.
p66
aVWe don't know what any of these symbols mean.
p67
aa(lp68
VThe symbols are most commonly found on seals.
p69
aVSo you see up there one such object.
p70
aVIt's the square object with the unicorn-like animal on it.
p71
aVNow that's a magnificent piece of art.
p72
aVSo how big do you think that is?
p73
aVPerhaps that big?
p74
aVOr maybe that big?
p75
aVWell let me show you.
p76
aVHere's a replica of one such seal.
p77
aVIt's only about one inch by one inch in size \u2014
p78
aVpretty tiny.
p79
aVSo what were these used for?
p80
aVWe know that these were used for stamping clay tags
p81
aVthat were attached to bundles of goods that were sent from one place to the other.
p82
aVSo you know those packing slips you get on your FedEx boxes?
p83
aVThese were used to make those kinds of packing slips.
p84
aVYou might wonder what these objects contain
p85
aVin terms of their text.
p86
aVPerhaps they're the name of the sender
p87
aVor some information about the goods
p88
aVthat are being sent from one place to the other \u2014 we don't know.
p89
aVWe need to decipher the script to answer that question.
p90
aa(lp91
VDeciphering the script
p92
aVis not just an intellectual puzzle;
p93
aVit's actually become a question
p94
aVthat's become deeply intertwined
p95
aVwith the politics and the cultural history of South Asia.
p96
aVIn fact, the script has become a battleground of sorts
p97
aVbetween three different groups of people.
p98
aVFirst, there's a group of people
p99
aVwho are very passionate in their belief
p100
aVthat the Indus script
p101
aVdoes not represent a language at all.
p102
aVThese people believe that the symbols
p103
aVare very similar to the kind of symbols you find on traffic signs
p104
aVor the emblems you find on shields.
p105
aVThere's a second group of people
p106
aVwho believe that the Indus script represents an Indo-European language.
p107
aVIf you look at a map of India today,
p108
aVyou'll see that most of the languages spoken in North India
p109
aVbelong to the Indo-European language family.
p110
aVSo some people believe that the Indus script
p111
aVrepresents an ancient Indo-European language such as Sanskrit.
p112
aa(lp113
VThere's a last group of people
p114
aVwho believe that the Indus people
p115
aVwere the ancestors of people living in South India today.
p116
aVThese people believe that the Indus script
p117
aVrepresents an ancient form
p118
aVof the Dravidian language family,
p119
aVwhich is the language family spoken in much of South India today.
p120
aVAnd the proponents of this theory
p121
aVpoint to that small pocket of Dravidian-speaking people in the North,
p122
aVactually near Afghanistan,
p123
aVand they say that perhaps, sometime in the past,
p124
aVDravidian languages were spoken all over India
p125
aVand that this suggests
p126
aVthat the Indus civilization is perhaps also Dravidian.
p127
aa(lp128
VWhich of these hypotheses can be true?
p129
aVWe don't know, but perhaps if you deciphered the script,
p130
aVyou would be able to answer this question.
p131
aVBut deciphering the script is a very challenging task.
p132
aVFirst, there's no Rosetta Stone.
p133
aVI don't mean the software;
p134
aVI mean an ancient artifact
p135
aVthat contains in the same text
p136
aVboth a known text and an unknown text.
p137
aVWe don't have such an artifact for the Indus script.
p138
aVAnd furthermore, we don't even know what language they spoke.
p139
aVAnd to make matters even worse,
p140
aVmost of the text that we have are extremely short.
p141
aVSo as I showed you, they're usually found on these seals
p142
aVthat are very, very tiny.
p143
aa(lp144
VAnd so given these formidable obstacles,
p145
aVone might wonder and worry
p146
aVwhether one will ever be able to decipher the Indus script.
p147
aVIn the rest of my talk,
p148
aVI'd like to tell you about how I learned to stop worrying
p149
aVand love the challenge posed by the Indus script.
p150
aVI've always been fascinated by the Indus script
p151
aVever since I read about it in a middle school textbook.
p152
aVAnd why was I fascinated?
p153
aVWell it's the last major undeciphered script in the ancient world.
p154
aVMy career path led me to become a computational neuroscientist,
p155
aVso in my day job,
p156
aVI create computer models of the brain
p157
aVto try to understand how the brain makes predictions,
p158
aVhow the brain makes decisions,
p159
aVhow the brain learns and so on.
p160
aa(lp161
VBut in 2007, my path crossed again with the Indus script.
p162
aVThat's when I was in India,
p163
aVand I had the wonderful opportunity
p164
aVto meet with some Indian scientists
p165
aVwho were using computer models to try to analyze the script.
p166
aVAnd so it was then that I realized
p167
aVthere was an opportunity for me to collaborate with these scientists,
p168
aVand so I jumped at that opportunity.
p169
aVAnd I'd like to describe some of the results that we have found.
p170
aVOr better yet, let's all collectively decipher.
p171
aVAre you ready?
p172
aa(lp173
VThe first thing that you need to do when you have an undeciphered script
p174
aVis try to figure out the direction of writing.
p175
aVHere are two texts that contain some symbols on them.
p176
aVCan you tell me
p177
aVif the direction of writing is right to left or left to right?
p178
aVI'll give you a couple of seconds.
p179
aVOkay. Right to left, how many? Okay.
p180
aVOkay. Left to right?
p181
aVOh, it's almost 50/50. Okay.
p182
aVThe answer is:
p183
aVif you look at the left-hand side of the two texts,
p184
aVyou'll notice that there's a cramping of signs,
p185
aVand it seems like 4,000 years ago,
p186
aVwhen the scribe was writing from right to left,
p187
aVthey ran out of space.
p188
aVAnd so they had to cram the sign.
p189
aVOne of the signs is also below the text on the top.
p190
aVThis suggests the direction of writing
p191
aVwas probably from right to left,
p192
aVand so that's one of the first things we know,
p193
aVthat directionality is a very key aspect of linguistic scripts.
p194
aVAnd the Indus script now has
p195
aVthis particular property.
p196
aa(lp197
VWhat other properties of language does the script show?
p198
aVLanguages contain patterns.
p199
aVIf I give you the letter Q
p200
aVand ask you to predict the next letter, what do you think that would be?
p201
aVMost of you said U, which is right.
p202
aVNow if I asked you to predict one more letter,
p203
aVwhat do you think that would be?
p204
aVNow there's several thoughts. There's E. It could be I. It could be A,
p205
aVbut certainly not B, C or D, right?
p206
aVThe Indus script also exhibits similar kinds of patterns.
p207
aVThere's a lot of text that start with this diamond-shaped symbol.
p208
aVAnd this in turn tends to be followed
p209
aVby this quotation marks-like symbol.
p210
aVAnd this is very similar to a Q and U example.
p211
aVThis symbol can in turn be followed
p212
aVby these fish-like symbols and some other signs,
p213
aVbut never by these other signs at the bottom.
p214
aVAnd furthermore, there's some signs
p215
aVthat really prefer the end of texts,
p216
aVsuch as this jar-shaped sign,
p217
aVand this sign, in fact, happens to be
p218
aVthe most frequently occurring sign in the script.
p219
aa(lp220
VGiven such patterns, here was our idea.
p221
aVThe idea was to use a computer
p222
aVto learn these patterns,
p223
aVand so we gave the computer the existing texts.
p224
aVAnd the computer learned a statistical model
p225
aVof which symbols tend to occur together
p226
aVand which symbols tend to follow each other.
p227
aVGiven the computer model,
p228
aVwe can test the model by essentially quizzing it.
p229
aVSo we could deliberately erase some symbols,
p230
aVand we can ask it to predict the missing symbols.
p231
aVHere are some examples.
p232
aVYou may regard this
p233
aVas perhaps the most ancient game
p234
aVof Wheel of Fortune.
p235
aa(lp236
VWhat we found
p237
aVwas that the computer was successful in 75 percent of the cases
p238
aVin predicting the correct symbol.
p239
aVIn the rest of the cases,
p240
aVtypically the second best guess or third best guess was the right answer.
p241
aVThere's also practical use
p242
aVfor this particular procedure.
p243
aVThere's a lot of these texts that are damaged.
p244
aVHere's an example of one such text.
p245
aVAnd we can use the computer model now to try to complete this text
p246
aVand make a best guess prediction.
p247
aVHere's an example of a symbol that was predicted.
p248
aVAnd this could be really useful as we try to decipher the script
p249
aVby generating more data that we can analyze.
p250
aa(lp251
VNow here's one other thing you can do with the computer model.
p252
aVSo imagine a monkey
p253
aVsitting at a keyboard.
p254
aVI think you might get a random jumble of letters that looks like this.
p255
aVSuch a random jumble of letters
p256
aVis said to have a very high entropy.
p257
aVThis is a physics and information theory term.
p258
aVBut just imagine it's a really random jumble of letters.
p259
aVHow many of you have ever spilled coffee on a keyboard?
p260
aVYou might have encountered the stuck-key problem \u2014
p261
aVso basically the same symbol being repeated over and over again.
p262
aVThis kind of a sequence is said to have a very low entropy
p263
aVbecause there's no variation at all.
p264
aVLanguage, on the other hand, has an intermediate level of entropy;
p265
aVit's neither too rigid,
p266
aVnor is it too random.
p267
aVWhat about the Indus script?
p268
aVHere's a graph that plots the entropies of a whole bunch of sequences.
p269
aVAt the very top you find the uniformly random sequence,
p270
aVwhich is a random jumble of letters \u2014
p271
aVand interestingly, we also find
p272
aVthe DNA sequence from the human genome and instrumental music.
p273
aVAnd both of these are very, very flexible,
p274
aVwhich is why you find them in the very high range.
p275
aVAt the lower end of the scale,
p276
aVyou find a rigid sequence, a sequence of all A's,
p277
aVand you also find a computer program,
p278
aVin this case in the language Fortran,
p279
aVwhich obeys really strict rules.
p280
aVLinguistic scripts
p281
aVoccupy the middle range.
p282
aa(lp283
VNow what about the Indus script?
p284
aVWe found that the Indus script
p285
aVactually falls within the range of the linguistic scripts.
p286
aVWhen this result was first published,
p287
aVit was highly controversial.
p288
aVThere were people who raised a hue and cry,
p289
aVand these people were the ones who believed
p290
aVthat the Indus script does not represent language.
p291
aVI even started to get some hate mail.
p292
aVMy students said
p293
aVthat I should really seriously consider getting some protection.
p294
aVWho'd have thought
p295
aVthat deciphering could be a dangerous profession?
p296
aVWhat does this result really show?
p297
aVIt shows that the Indus script
p298
aVshares an important property of language.
p299
aVSo, as the old saying goes,
p300
aVif it looks like a linguistic script
p301
aVand it acts like a linguistic script,
p302
aVthen perhaps we may have a linguistic script on our hands.
p303
aVWhat other evidence is there
p304
aVthat the script could actually encode language?
p305
aa(lp306
VWell linguistic scripts can actually encode multiple languages.
p307
aVSo for example, here's the same sentence written in English
p308
aVand the same sentence written in Dutch
p309
aVusing the same letters of the alphabet.
p310
aVIf you don't know Dutch and you only know English
p311
aVand I give you some words in Dutch,
p312
aVyou'll tell me that these words contain
p313
aVsome very unusual patterns.
p314
aVSome things are not right,
p315
aVand you'll say these words are probably not English words.
p316
aVThe same thing happens in the case of the Indus script.
p317
aVThe computer found several texts \u2014
p318
aVtwo of them are shown here \u2014
p319
aVthat have very unusual patterns.
p320
aVSo for example the first text:
p321
aVthere's a doubling of this jar-shaped sign.
p322
aVThis sign is the most frequently-occurring sign
p323
aVin the Indus script,
p324
aVand it's only in this text
p325
aVthat it occurs as a doubling pair.
p326
aa(lp327
VWhy is that the case?
p328
aVWe went back and looked at where these particular texts were found,
p329
aVand it turns out that they were found
p330
aVvery, very far away from the Indus Valley.
p331
aVThey were found in present day Iraq and Iran.
p332
aVAnd why were they found there?
p333
aVWhat I haven't told you is that
p334
aVthe Indus people were very, very enterprising.
p335
aVThey used to trade with people pretty far away from where they lived,
p336
aVand so in this case, they were traveling by sea
p337
aVall the way to Mesopotamia, present-day Iraq.
p338
aVAnd what seems to have happened here
p339
aVis that the Indus traders, the merchants,
p340
aVwere using this script to write a foreign language.
p341
aVIt's just like our English and Dutch example.
p342
aVAnd that would explain why we have these strange patterns
p343
aVthat are very different from the kinds of patterns you see in the text
p344
aVthat are found within the Indus Valley.
p345
aVThis suggests that the same script, the Indus script,
p346
aVcould be used to write different languages.
p347
aVThe results we have so far seem to point to the conclusion
p348
aVthat the Indus script probably does represent language.
p349
aa(lp350
VIf it does represent language,
p351
aVthen how do we read the symbols?
p352
aVThat's our next big challenge.
p353
aVSo you'll notice that many of the symbols
p354
aVlook like pictures of humans, of insects,
p355
aVof fishes, of birds.
p356
aVMost ancient scripts
p357
aVuse the rebus principle,
p358
aVwhich is, using pictures to represent words.
p359
aVSo as an example, here's a word.
p360
aVCan you write it using pictures?
p361
aVI'll give you a couple seconds.
p362
aVGot it?
p363
aVOkay. Great.
p364
aVHere's my solution.
p365
aVYou could use the picture of a bee followed by a picture of a leaf \u2014
p366
aVand that's "belief," right.
p367
aVThere could be other solutions.
p368
aVIn the case of the Indus script,
p369
aVthe problem is the reverse.
p370
aVYou have to figure out the sounds of each of these pictures
p371
aVsuch that the entire sequence makes sense.
p372
aVSo this is just like a crossword puzzle,
p373
aVexcept that this is the mother of all crossword puzzles
p374
aVbecause the stakes are so high if you solve it.
p375
aa(lp376
VMy colleagues, Iravatham Mahadevan and Asko Parpola,
p377
aVhave been making some headway on this particular problem.
p378
aVAnd I'd like to give you a quick example of Parpola's work.
p379
aVHere's a really short text.
p380
aVIt contains seven vertical strokes followed by this fish-like sign.
p381
aVAnd I want to mention that these seals were used
p382
aVfor stamping clay tags
p383
aVthat were attached to bundles of goods,
p384
aVso it's quite likely that these tags, at least some of them,
p385
aVcontain names of merchants.
p386
aVAnd it turns out that in India
p387
aVthere's a long tradition
p388
aVof names being based on horoscopes
p389
aVand star constellations present at the time of birth.
p390
aVIn Dravidian languages,
p391
aVthe word for fish is "meen"
p392
aVwhich happens to sound just like the word for star.
p393
aVAnd so seven stars
p394
aVwould stand for "elu meen,"
p395
aVwhich is the Dravidian word
p396
aVfor the Big Dipper star constellation.
p397
aVSimilarly, there's another sequence of six stars,
p398
aVand that translates to "aru meen,"
p399
aVwhich is the old Dravidian name
p400
aVfor the star constellation Pleiades.
p401
aVAnd finally, there's other combinations,
p402
aVsuch as this fish sign with something that looks like a roof on top of it.
p403
aVAnd that could be translated into "mey meen,"
p404
aVwhich is the old Dravidian name for the planet Saturn.
p405
aVSo that was pretty exciting.
p406
aVIt looks like we're getting somewhere.
p407
aa(lp408
VBut does this prove
p409
aVthat these seals contain Dravidian names
p410
aVbased on planets and star constellations?
p411
aVWell not yet.
p412
aVSo we have no way of validating
p413
aVthese particular readings,
p414
aVbut if more and more of these readings start making sense,
p415
aVand if longer and longer sequences
p416
aVappear to be correct,
p417
aVthen we know that we are on the right track.
p418
aVToday,
p419
aVwe can write a word such as TED
p420
aVin Egyptian hieroglyphics and in cuneiform script,
p421
aVbecause both of these were deciphered
p422
aVin the 19th century.
p423
aVThe decipherment of these two scripts
p424
aVenabled these civilizations to speak to us again directly.
p425
aVThe Mayans
p426
aVstarted speaking to us in the 20th century,
p427
aVbut the Indus civilization remains silent.
p428
aa(lp429
VWhy should we care?
p430
aVThe Indus civilization does not belong
p431
aVto just the South Indians or the North Indians
p432
aVor the Pakistanis;
p433
aVit belongs to all of us.
p434
aVThese are our ancestors \u2014
p435
aVyours and mine.
p436
aVThey were silenced
p437
aVby an unfortunate accident of history.
p438
aVIf we decipher the script,
p439
aVwe would enable them to speak to us again.
p440
aVWhat would they tell us?
p441
aVWhat would we find out about them? About us?
p442
aVI can't wait to find out.
p443
aa(lp444
VThank you.
