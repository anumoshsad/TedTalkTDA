VDelighted to be here
p4
aVand to talk to you about a subject dear to my heart,
p5
aVwhich is beauty.
p6
aVI do the philosophy of art, aesthetics,
p7
aVactually, for a living.
p8
aVI try to figure out intellectually,
p9
aVphilosophically, psychologically,
p10
aVwhat the experience of beauty is,
p11
aVwhat sensibly can be said about it
p12
aVand how people go off the rails in trying to understand it.
p13
aVNow this is an extremely complicated subject,
p14
aVin part because the things that we call beautiful
p15
aVare so different.
p16
aVI mean just think of the sheer variety \u2014
p17
aVa baby's face,
p18
aVBerlioz's "Harold in Italy,"
p19
aVmovies like "The Wizard of Oz"
p20
aVor the plays of Chekhov,
p21
aVa central California landscape,
p22
aVa Hokusai view of Mt. Fuji,
p23
aV"Der Rosenkavalier,"
p24
aVa stunning match-winning goal
p25
aVin a World Cup soccer match,
p26
aVVan Gogh's "Starry Night,"
p27
aVa Jane Austen novel,
p28
aVFred Astaire dancing across the screen.
p29
aVThis brief list includes human beings,
p30
aVnatural landforms,
p31
aVworks of art and skilled human actions.
p32
aVAn account that explains the presence of beauty
p33
aVin everything on this list
p34
aVis not going to be easy.
p35
aa(lp36
VI can, however, give you at least a taste
p37
aVof what I regard
p38
aVas the most powerful theory of beauty
p39
aVwe yet have.
p40
aVAnd we get it not from a philosopher of art,
p41
aVnot from a postmodern art theorist
p42
aVor a bigwig art critic.
p43
aVNo, this theory
p44
aVcomes from an expert
p45
aVon barnacles and worms and pigeon breeding,
p46
aVand you know who I mean:
p47
aVCharles Darwin.
p48
aVOf course, a lot of people think they already know
p49
aVthe proper answer to the question,
p50
aV"What is beauty?"
p51
aVIt's in the eye of the beholder.
p52
aVIt's whatever moves you personally.
p53
aVOr, as some people,
p54
aVespecially academics prefer,
p55
aVbeauty is in the culturally conditioned
p56
aVeye of the beholder.
p57
aVPeople agree that paintings or movies or music
p58
aVare beautiful
p59
aVbecause their cultures determine a uniformity of aesthetic taste.
p60
aVTaste for both natural beauty and for the arts
p61
aVtravel across cultures
p62
aVwith great ease.
p63
aVBeethoven is adored in Japan.
p64
aVPeruvians love Japanese woodblock prints.
p65
aVInca sculptures are regarded as treasures
p66
aVin British museums,
p67
aVwhile Shakespeare is translated
p68
aVinto every major language of the Earth.
p69
aVOr just think about American jazz
p70
aVor American movies \u2014
p71
aVthey go everywhere.
p72
aVThere are many differences among the arts,
p73
aVbut there are also universal,
p74
aVcross-cultural aesthetic pleasures
p75
aVand values.
p76
aa(lp77
VHow can we explain
p78
aVthis universality?
p79
aVThe best answer lies in trying to reconstruct
p80
aVa Darwinian evolutionary history
p81
aVof our artistic and aesthetic tastes.
p82
aVWe need to reverse-engineer
p83
aVour present artistic tastes and preferences
p84
aVand explain how they came
p85
aVto be engraved in our minds
p86
aVby the actions of both our prehistoric,
p87
aVlargely pleistocene environments,
p88
aVwhere we became fully human,
p89
aVbut also by the social situations
p90
aVin which we evolved.
p91
aVThis reverse engineering
p92
aVcan also enlist help
p93
aVfrom the human record
p94
aVpreserved in prehistory.
p95
aVI mean fossils, cave paintings and so forth.
p96
aVAnd it should take into account
p97
aVwhat we know of the aesthetic interests
p98
aVof isolated hunter-gatherer bands
p99
aVthat survived into the 19th and the 20th centuries.
p100
aa(lp101
VNow, I personally
p102
aVhave no doubt whatsoever
p103
aVthat the experience of beauty,
p104
aVwith its emotional intensity and pleasure,
p105
aVbelongs to our evolved human psychology.
p106
aVThe experience of beauty is one component
p107
aVin a whole series of Darwinian adaptations.
p108
aVBeauty is an adaptive effect,
p109
aVwhich we extend
p110
aVand intensify
p111
aVin the creation and enjoyment
p112
aVof works of art and entertainment.
p113
aVAs many of you will know,
p114
aVevolution operates by two main primary mechanisms.
p115
aVThe first of these is natural selection \u2014
p116
aVthat's random mutation and selective retention \u2014
p117
aValong with our basic anatomy and physiology \u2014
p118
aVthe evolution of the pancreas or the eye or the fingernails.
p119
aVNatural selection also explains
p120
aVmany basic revulsions,
p121
aVsuch as the horrid smell of rotting meat,
p122
aVor fears, such as the fear of snakes
p123
aVor standing close to the edge of a cliff.
p124
aVNatural selection also explains pleasures \u2014
p125
aVsexual pleasure,
p126
aVour liking for sweet, fat and proteins,
p127
aVwhich in turn explains a lot of popular foods,
p128
aVfrom ripe fruits through chocolate malts
p129
aVand barbecued ribs.
p130
aa(lp131
VThe other great principle of evolution
p132
aVis sexual selection,
p133
aVand it operates very differently.
p134
aVThe peacock's magnificent tail
p135
aVis the most famous example of this.
p136
aVIt did not evolve for natural survival.
p137
aVIn fact, it goes against natural survival.
p138
aVNo, the peacock's tail
p139
aVresults from the mating choices
p140
aVmade by peahens.
p141
aVIt's quite a familiar story.
p142
aVIt's women who actually push history forward.
p143
aVDarwin himself, by the way,
p144
aVhad no doubts that the peacock's tail
p145
aVwas beautiful in the eyes of the peahen.
p146
aVHe actually used that word.
p147
aVNow, keeping these ideas firmly in mind,
p148
aVwe can say that the experience of beauty
p149
aVis one of the ways that evolution has
p150
aVof arousing and sustaining
p151
aVinterest or fascination,
p152
aVeven obsession,
p153
aVin order to encourage us
p154
aVtoward making the most adaptive decisions
p155
aVfor survival and reproduction.
p156
aVBeauty is nature's way
p157
aVof acting at a distance,
p158
aVso to speak.
p159
aVI mean, you can't expect to eat
p160
aVan adaptively beneficial landscape.
p161
aVIt would hardly do to eat your baby
p162
aVor your lover.
p163
aVSo evolution's trick
p164
aVis to make them beautiful,
p165
aVto have them exert a kind of magnetism
p166
aVto give you the pleasure of simply looking at them.
p167
aa(lp168
VConsider briefly an important source of aesthetic pleasure,
p169
aVthe magnetic pull
p170
aVof beautiful landscapes.
p171
aVPeople in very different cultures
p172
aVall over the world
p173
aVtend to like a particular kind of landscape,
p174
aVa landscape that just happens to be similar
p175
aVto the pleistocene savannas where we evolved.
p176
aVThis landscape shows up today
p177
aVon calendars, on postcards,
p178
aVin the design of golf courses and public parks
p179
aVand in gold-framed pictures
p180
aVthat hang in living rooms
p181
aVfrom New York to New Zealand.
p182
aVIt's a kind of Hudson River school landscape
p183
aVfeaturing open spaces
p184
aVof low grasses
p185
aVinterspersed with copses of trees.
p186
aVThe trees, by the way, are often preferred
p187
aVif they fork near the ground,
p188
aVthat is to say, if they're trees you could scramble up
p189
aVif you were in a tight fix.
p190
aVThe landscape shows the presence
p191
aVof water directly in view,
p192
aVor evidence of water in a bluish distance,
p193
aVindications of animal or bird life
p194
aVas well as diverse greenery
p195
aVand finally \u2014 get this \u2014
p196
aVa path
p197
aVor a road,
p198
aVperhaps a riverbank or a shoreline,
p199
aVthat extends into the distance,
p200
aValmost inviting you to follow it.
p201
aVThis landscape type is regarded as beautiful,
p202
aVeven by people in countries
p203
aVthat don't have it.
p204
aVThe ideal savanna landscape
p205
aVis one of the clearest examples
p206
aVwhere human beings everywhere
p207
aVfind beauty
p208
aVin similar visual experience.
p209
aa(lp210
VBut, someone might argue,
p211
aVthat's natural beauty.
p212
aVHow about artistic beauty?
p213
aVIsn't that exhaustively cultural?
p214
aVNo, I don't think it is.
p215
aVAnd once again, I'd like to look back to prehistory
p216
aVto say something about it.
p217
aVIt is widely assumed
p218
aVthat the earliest human artworks
p219
aVare the stupendously skillful cave paintings
p220
aVthat we all know from Lascaux
p221
aVand Chauvet.
p222
aVChauvet caves
p223
aVare about 32,000 years old,
p224
aValong with a few small, realistic sculptures
p225
aVof women and animals from the same period.
p226
aVBut artistic and decorative skills
p227
aVare actually much older than that.
p228
aVBeautiful shell necklaces
p229
aVthat look like something you'd see at an arts and crafts fair,
p230
aVas well as ochre body paint,
p231
aVhave been found
p232
aVfrom around 100,000 years ago.
p233
aa(lp234
VBut the most intriguing prehistoric artifacts
p235
aVare older even than this.
p236
aVI have in mind
p237
aVthe so-called Acheulian hand axes.
p238
aVThe oldest stone tools are choppers
p239
aVfrom the Olduvai Gorge in East Africa.
p240
aVThey go back about two-and-a-half-million years.
p241
aVThese crude tools
p242
aVwere around for thousands of centuries,
p243
aVuntil around 1.4 million years ago
p244
aVwhen Homo erectus
p245
aVstarted shaping
p246
aVsingle, thin stone blades,
p247
aVsometimes rounded ovals,
p248
aVbut often in what are to our eyes
p249
aVan arresting, symmetrical pointed leaf
p250
aVor teardrop form.
p251
aVThese Acheulian hand axes \u2014
p252
aVthey're named after St. Acheul in France,
p253
aVwhere finds were made in 19th century \u2014
p254
aVhave been unearthed in their thousands,
p255
aVscattered across Asia, Europe and Africa,
p256
aValmost everywhere Homo erectus
p257
aVand Homo ergaster roamed.
p258
aVNow, the sheer numbers of these hand axes
p259
aVshows that they can't have been made
p260
aVfor butchering animals.
p261
aVAnd the plot really thickens when you realize
p262
aVthat, unlike other pleistocene tools,
p263
aVthe hand axes often exhibit
p264
aVno evidence of wear
p265
aVon their delicate blade edges.
p266
aVAnd some, in any event, are too big
p267
aVto use for butchery.
p268
aVTheir symmetry, their attractive materials
p269
aVand, above all,
p270
aVtheir meticulous workmanship
p271
aVare simply quite beautiful
p272
aVto our eyes, even today.
p273
aa(lp274
VSo what were these ancient \u2014
p275
aVI mean, they're ancient, they're foreign,
p276
aVbut they're at the same time
p277
aVsomehow familiar.
p278
aVWhat were these artifacts for?
p279
aVThe best available answer
p280
aVis that they were literally
p281
aVthe earliest known works of art,
p282
aVpractical tools transformed
p283
aVinto captivating aesthetic objects,
p284
aVcontemplated both for their elegant shape
p285
aVand their virtuoso craftsmanship.
p286
aVHand axes mark
p287
aVan evolutionary advance in human history \u2014
p288
aVtools fashioned to function
p289
aVas what Darwinians call "fitness signals" \u2014
p290
aVthat is to say, displays
p291
aVthat are performances
p292
aVlike the peacock's tail,
p293
aVexcept that, unlike hair and feathers,
p294
aVthe hand axes are consciously
p295
aVcleverly crafted.
p296
aVCompetently made hand axes
p297
aVindicated desirable personal qualities \u2014
p298
aVintelligence, fine motor control,
p299
aVplanning ability,
p300
aVconscientiousness
p301
aVand sometimes access to rare materials.
p302
aVOver tens of thousands of generations,
p303
aVsuch skills increased the status
p304
aVof those who displayed them
p305
aVand gained a reproductive advantage
p306
aVover the less capable.
p307
aVYou know, it's an old line,
p308
aVbut it has been shown to work \u2014
p309
aV"Why don't you come up to my cave, so I can show you my hand axes?"
p310
aa(lp311
V(Laughter)
p312
aa(lp313
VExcept, of course, what's interesting about this
p314
aVis that we can't be sure how that idea was conveyed,
p315
aVbecause the Homo erectus
p316
aVthat made these objects
p317
aVdid not have language.
p318
aVIt's hard to grasp,
p319
aVbut it's an incredible fact.
p320
aVThis object was made
p321
aVby a hominid ancestor,
p322
aVHomo erectus or Homo ergaster,
p323
aVbetween 50,000 and 100,000 years
p324
aVbefore language.
p325
aVStretching over a million years,
p326
aVthe hand axe tradition
p327
aVis the longest artistic tradition
p328
aVin human and proto-human history.
p329
aVBy the end of the hand axe epic, Homo sapiens \u2014
p330
aVas they were then called, finally \u2014
p331
aVwere doubtless finding new ways
p332
aVto amuse and amaze each other
p333
aVby, who knows, telling jokes,
p334
aVstorytelling, dancing, or hairstyling.
p335
aVYes, hairstyling \u2014 I insist on that.
p336
aa(lp337
VFor us moderns,
p338
aVvirtuoso technique
p339
aVis used to create imaginary worlds
p340
aVin fiction and in movies,
p341
aVto express intense emotions
p342
aVwith music, painting and dance.
p343
aVBut still,
p344
aVone fundamental trait
p345
aVof the ancestral personality persists
p346
aVin our aesthetic cravings:
p347
aVthe beauty we find
p348
aVin skilled performances.
p349
aVFrom Lascaux to the Louvre
p350
aVto Carnegie Hall,
p351
aVhuman beings
p352
aVhave a permanent innate taste
p353
aVfor virtuoso displays in the arts.
p354
aVWe find beauty
p355
aVin something done well.
p356
aa(lp357
VSo the next time you pass a jewelry shop window
p358
aVdisplaying a beautifully cut
p359
aVteardrop-shaped stone,
p360
aVdon't be so sure
p361
aVit's just your culture telling you
p362
aVthat that sparkling jewel is beautiful.
p363
aVYour distant ancestors loved that shape
p364
aVand found beauty in the skill needed to make it,
p365
aVeven before
p366
aVthey could put their love into words.
p367
aVIs beauty in the eye of the beholder?
p368
aVNo, it's deep in our minds.
p369
aVIt's a gift handed down from the intelligent skills
p370
aVand rich emotional lives
p371
aVof our most ancient ancestors.
p372
aVOur powerful reaction to images,
p373
aVto the expression of emotion in art,
p374
aVto the beauty of music, to the night sky,
p375
aVwill be with us and our descendants
p376
aVfor as long as the human race exists.
p377
aa(lp378
