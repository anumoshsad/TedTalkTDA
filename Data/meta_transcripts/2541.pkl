VHi. My name is Marwa, and I'm an architect.
p4
aVI was born and raised in Homs,
p5
aVa city in the central western part of Syria,
p6
aVand I've always lived here.
p7
aVAfter six years of war,
p8
aVHoms is now a half-destroyed city.
p9
aVMy family and I were lucky; our place is still standing.
p10
aVAlthough for two years, we were like prisoners at home.
p11
aVOutside there were demonstrations and battles and bombings and snipers.
p12
aVMy husband and I used to run an architecture studio
p13
aVin the old town main square.
p14
aVIt's gone, as is most of the old town itself.
p15
aVHalf of the city's other neighborhoods
p16
aVare now rubble.
p17
aVSince the ceasefire in late 2015,
p18
aVlarge parts of Homs have been more or less quiet.
p19
aVThe economy is completely broken, and people are still fighting.
p20
aVThe merchants who had stalls in the old city market
p21
aVnow trade out of sheds on the streets.
p22
aVUnder our apartment, there is a carpenter,
p23
aVsweetshops, a butcher, a printing house, workshops, among many more.
p24
aVI have started teaching part-time,
p25
aVand with my husband, who juggles several jobs,
p26
aVwe've opened a small bookshop.
p27
aVOther people do all sorts of jobs to get by.
p28
aa(lp29
VWhen I look at my destroyed city, of course, I ask myself:
p30
aVWhat has led to this senseless war?
p31
aVSyria was largely a place of tolerance,
p32
aVhistorically accustomed to variety,
p33
aVaccommodating a wide range of beliefs, origins, customs,
p34
aVgoods, food.
p35
aVHow did my country \u2014
p36
aVa country with communities living harmoniously together
p37
aVand comfortable in discussing their differences \u2014
p38
aVhow did it degenerate into civil war, violence, displacement
p39
aVand unprecedented sectarian hatred?
p40
aVThere were many reasons that had led to the war \u2014
p41
aVsocial, political and economic.
p42
aVThey all have played their role.
p43
aVBut I believe there is one key reason that has been overlooked
p44
aVand which is important to analyze,
p45
aVbecause from it will largely depend
p46
aVwhether we can make sure that this doesn't happen again.
p47
aVAnd that reason is architecture.
p48
aa(lp49
VArchitecture in my country has played an important role
p50
aVin creating, directing and amplifying conflict between warring factions,
p51
aVand this is probably true for other countries as well.
p52
aVThere is a sure correspondence between the architecture of a place
p53
aVand the character of the community that has settled there.
p54
aVArchitecture plays a key role in whether a community crumbles
p55
aVor comes together.
p56
aVSyrian society has long lived the coexistence
p57
aVof different traditions and backgrounds.
p58
aVSyrians have experienced the prosperity of open trade
p59
aVand sustainable communities.
p60
aVThey have enjoyed the true meaning of belonging to a place,
p61
aVand that was reflected in their built environment,
p62
aVin the mosques and churches built back-to-back,
p63
aVin the interwoven souks and public venues,
p64
aVand the proportions and sizes based on principles of humanity and harmony.
p65
aa(lp66
VThis architecture of mixity can still be read in the remains.
p67
aVThe old Islamic city in Syria was built over a multilayered past,
p68
aVintegrating with it and embracing its spirit.
p69
aVSo did its communities.
p70
aVPeople lived and worked with each other
p71
aVin a place that gave them a sense of belonging
p72
aVand made them feel at home.
p73
aVThey shared a remarkably unified existence.
p74
aa(lp75
VBut over the last century,
p76
aVgradually this delicate balance of these places has been interfered with;
p77
aVfirst, by the urban planners of the colonial period,
p78
aVwhen the French went enthusiastically about,
p79
aVtransforming what they saw as the un-modern Syrian cities.
p80
aVThey blew up city streets and relocated monuments.
p81
aVThey called them improvements,
p82
aVand they were the beginning of a long, slow unraveling.
p83
aVThe traditional urbanism and architecture of our cities
p84
aVassured identity and belonging not by separation,
p85
aVbut by intertwining.
p86
aVBut over time, the ancient became worthless, and the new, coveted.
p87
aVThe harmony of the built environment and social environment
p88
aVgot trampled over by elements of modernity \u2014
p89
aVbrutal, unfinished concrete blocks,
p90
aVneglect, aesthetic devastation,
p91
aVdivisive urbanism that zoned communities by class, creed or affluence.
p92
aa(lp93
VAnd the same was happening to the community.
p94
aVAs the shape of the built environment changed,
p95
aVso the lifestyles and sense of belonging of the communities
p96
aValso started changing.
p97
aVFrom a register of togetherness, of belonging,
p98
aVarchitecture became a way of differentiation,
p99
aVand communities started drifting apart
p100
aVfrom the very fabric that used to unite them,
p101
aVand from the soul of the place that used to represent their common existence.
p102
aa(lp103
VWhile many reasons had led to the Syrian war,
p104
aVwe shouldn't underestimate the way in which,
p105
aVby contributing to the loss  of identity and self-respect,
p106
aVurban zoning and misguided, inhumane architecture
p107
aVhave nurtured sectarian divisions and hatred.
p108
aVOver time, the united city has morphed into a city center
p109
aVwith ghettos along its circumference.
p110
aVAnd in turn, the coherent communities became distinct social groups,
p111
aValienated from each other and alienated from the place.
p112
aVFrom my point of view,
p113
aVlosing the sense of belonging to a place
p114
aVand a sense of sharing it with someone else
p115
aVhas made it a lot easier to destroy.
p116
aa(lp117
VThe clear example can be seen in the informal housing system,
p118
aVwhich used to host, before the war, over 40 percent of the population.
p119
aVYes, prior to the war, almost half of the Syrian population
p120
aVlived in slums,
p121
aVperipheral areas without proper infrastructure,
p122
aVmade of endless rows of bare block boxes
p123
aVcontaining people,
p124
aVpeople who mostly belonged to the same group,
p125
aVwhether based on religion, class, origin or all of the above.
p126
aa(lp127
VThis ghettoized urbanism proved to be a tangible precursor of war.
p128
aVConflict is much easier between pre-categorized areas \u2014
p129
aVwhere the "others" live.
p130
aVThe ties that used to bind the city together \u2014
p131
aVwhether they were social, through coherent building,
p132
aVor economic, through trade in the souk,
p133
aVor religious, through the coexistent presence \u2014
p134
aVwere all lost in the misguided and visionless modernization
p135
aVof the built environment.
p136
aa(lp137
VAllow me an aside.
p138
aVWhen I read about heterogeneous urbanism in other parts of the world,
p139
aVinvolving ethnic neighborhoods in British cities
p140
aVor around Paris or Brussels,
p141
aVI recognize the beginning of the kind of instability
p142
aVwe have witnessed so disastrously here in Syria.
p143
aa(lp144
VWe have severely destroyed cities,
p145
aVsuch as Homs, Aleppo, Daraa and many others,
p146
aVand almost half of the population of the country is now displaced.
p147
aa(lp148
VHopefully, the war will end,
p149
aVand the question that, as an architect, I have to ask, is:
p150
aVHow do we rebuild?
p151
aVWhat are the principles that we should adopt
p152
aVin order to avoid repeating the same mistakes?
p153
aVFrom my point of view, the main focus should be on creating places
p154
aVthat make their people feel they belong.
p155
aVArchitecture and planning need to recapture
p156
aVsome of the traditional values that did just that,
p157
aVcreating the conditions for coexistence and peace,
p158
aVvalues of beauty that don't exhibit ostentation,
p159
aVbut rather, approachability and ease,
p160
aVmoral values that promote generosity and acceptance,
p161
aVarchitecture that is for everyone to enjoy, not just for the elite,
p162
aVjust as used to be in the shadowed alleys of the old Islamic city,
p163
aVmixed designs that encourage a sense of community.
p164
aa(lp165
VThere is a neighborhood here in Homs that's called Baba Amr
p166
aVthat has been fully destroyed.
p167
aVAlmost two years ago, I introduced this design
p168
aVinto a UN-Habitat competition for rebuilding it.
p169
aVThe idea was to create an urban fabric inspired by a tree,
p170
aVcapable of growing and spreading organically,
p171
aVechoing the traditional bridge hanging over the old alleys,
p172
aVand incorporating apartments, private courtyards, shops,
p173
aVworkshops, places for parking and playing and leisure,
p174
aVtrees and shaded areas.
p175
aVIt's far from perfect, obviously.
p176
aVI drew it during the few hours of electricity we get.
p177
aVAnd there are many possible ways to express belonging and community
p178
aVthrough architecture.
p179
aVBut compare it with the freestanding, disconnected blocks
p180
aVproposed by the official project for rebuilding Baba Amr.
p181
aa(lp182
VArchitecture is not the axis around which all human life rotates,
p183
aVbut it has the power to suggest and even direct human activity.
p184
aVIn that sense, settlement, identity and social integration
p185
aVare all the producer and product of effective urbanism.
p186
aVThe coherent urbanism of the old Islamic city
p187
aVand of many old European towns, for instance,
p188
aVpromote integration,
p189
aVwhile rows of soulless housing or tower blocks,
p190
aVeven when they are luxurious,
p191
aVtend to promote isolation and "otherness."
p192
aVEven simple things
p193
aVlike shaded places or fruit plants or drinking water inside the city
p194
aVcan make a difference in how people feel towards the place,
p195
aVand whether they consider it a generous place that gives,
p196
aVa place that's worth keeping, contributing to,
p197
aVor whether they see it as an alienating place,
p198
aVfull of seeds of anger.
p199
aVIn order for a place to give, its architecture should be giving, too.
p200
aa(lp201
VOur built environment matters.
p202
aVThe fabric of our cities is reflected in the fabric of our souls.
p203
aVAnd whether in the shape of informal concrete slums
p204
aVor broken social housing
p205
aVor trampled old towns
p206
aVor forests of skyscrapers,
p207
aVthe contemporary urban archetypes
p208
aVthat have emerged all across the Middle East
p209
aVhave been one cause of the alienation and fragmentation of our communities.
p210
aa(lp211
VWe can learn from this.
p212
aVWe can learn how to rebuild in another way,
p213
aVhow to create an architecture that doesn't contribute only
p214
aVto the practical and economic aspects of people's lives,
p215
aVbut also to their social, spiritual and psychological needs.
p216
aVThose needs were totally overlooked in the Syrian cities before the war.
p217
aVWe need to create again cities that are shared
p218
aVby the communities that inhabit them.
p219
aVIf we do so, people will not feel the need
p220
aVto seek identities opposed to the other identities all around,
p221
aVbecause they will all feel at home.
