VI think it'll be a relief to some people and a disappointment to others
p4
aVthat I'm not going to talk about vaginas today.
p5
aVI began "The Vagina Monologues" because I was worried about vaginas.
p6
aVI'm very worried today about this notion, this world,
p7
aVthis prevailing kind of force of security.
p8
aVI see this word, hear this word, feel this word everywhere.
p9
aVReal security, security checks, security watch, security clearance.
p10
aVWhy has all this focus on security made me feel so much more insecure?
p11
aVWhat does anyone mean when they talk about real security?
p12
aVAnd why have we, as Americans particularly,
p13
aVbecome a nation that strives for security above all else?
p14
aVIn fact, I think that security is elusive. It's impossible.
p15
aVWe all die. We all get old. We all get sick. People leave us.
p16
aVPeople change us. Nothing is secure.
p17
aVAnd that's actually the good news.
p18
aa(lp19
VThis is, of course, unless your whole life is about being secure.
p20
aVI think that when that is the focus of your life,
p21
aVthese are the things that happen.
p22
aVYou can't travel very far or venture too far outside a certain circle.
p23
aVYou can't allow too many conflicting ideas into your mind at one time,
p24
aVas they might confuse you or challenge you.
p25
aVYou can't open yourself to new experiences, new people,
p26
aVnew ways of doing things \u2014 they might take you off course.
p27
aVYou can't not know who you are, so you cling to hard-matter identity.
p28
aVYou become a Christian, Muslim, Jew.
p29
aVYou're an Indian, Egyptian, Italian, American.
p30
aVYou're a heterosexual or a homosexual, or you never have sex.
p31
aVOr at least, that's what you say when you identify yourself.
p32
aVYou become part of an "us."
p33
aVIn order to be secure, you defend against "them."
p34
aVYou cling to your land because it is your secure place.
p35
aVYou must fight anyone who encroaches upon it.
p36
aVYou become your nation. You become your religion.
p37
aVYou become whatever it is that will freeze you, numb you
p38
aVand protect you from doubt or change.
p39
aVBut all this does, actually, is shut down your mind.
p40
aVIn reality, it does not really make you safer.
p41
aa(lp42
VI was in Sri Lanka, for example, three days after the tsunami,
p43
aVand I was standing on the beaches
p44
aVand it was absolutely clear that, in a matter of five minutes,
p45
aVa 30-foot wave could rise up
p46
aVand desecrate a people, a population and lives.
p47
aVAll this striving for security, in fact,
p48
aVhas made you much more insecure
p49
aVbecause now you have to watch out all the time.
p50
aVThere are people not like you \u2014 people who you now call enemies.
p51
aVYou have places you cannot go, thoughts you cannot think,
p52
aVworlds that you can no longer inhabit.
p53
aVAnd so you spend your days fighting things off, defending your territory
p54
aVand becoming more entrenched in your fundamental thinking.
p55
aVYour days become devoted to protecting yourself.
p56
aVThis becomes your mission. That is all you do.
p57
aVIdeas get shorter. They become sound bytes.
p58
aVThere are evildoers and saints, criminals and victims.
p59
aa(lp60
VThere are those who, if they're not with us, are against us.
p61
aVIt gets easier to hurt people because you do not feel what's inside them.
p62
aVIt gets easier to lock them up, force them to be naked, humiliate them,
p63
aVoccupy them, invade them and kill them,
p64
aVbecause they are only obstacles now to your security.
p65
aVIn six years, I've had the extraordinary privilege through V-Day,
p66
aVa global movement against [violence against] women,
p67
aVto travel probably to 60 countries,
p68
aVand spend a great deal of time in different portions.
p69
aVI've met women and men all over this planet,
p70
aVwho through various circumstances \u2014
p71
aVwar, poverty, racism, multiple forms of violence \u2014
p72
aVhave never known security,
p73
aVor have had their illusion of security forever devastated.
p74
aVI've spent time with women in Afghanistan under the Taliban,
p75
aVwho were essentially brutalized and censored.
p76
aVI've been in Bosnian refugee camps.
p77
aVI was with women in Pakistan
p78
aVwho have had their faces melted off with acid.
p79
aVI've been with girls all across America who were date-raped,
p80
aVor raped by their best friends when they were drugged one night.
p81
aa(lp82
VOne of the amazing things that I've discovered in my travels
p83
aVis that there is this emerging species.
p84
aVI loved when he was talking about this other world that's right next to this world.
p85
aVI've discovered these people, who, in V-Day world,
p86
aVwe call Vagina Warriors.
p87
aVThese particular people, rather than getting AK-47s,
p88
aVor weapons of mass destruction, or machetes,
p89
aVin the spirit of the warrior, have gone into the center, the heart of pain, of loss.
p90
aVThey have grieved it, they have died into it,
p91
aVand allowed and encouraged poison to turn into medicine.
p92
aVThey have used the fuel of their pain to begin to redirect that energy
p93
aVtowards another mission and another trajectory.
p94
aa(lp95
VThese warriors now devote themselves and their lives
p96
aVto making sure what happened to them doesn't happen to anyone else.
p97
aVThere are thousands if not millions of them on the planet.
p98
aVI venture there are many in this room.
p99
aVThey have a fierceness and a freedom
p100
aVthat I believe is the bedrock of a new paradigm.
p101
aVThey have broken out of the existing frame of victim and perpetrator.
p102
aVTheir own personal security is not their end goal,
p103
aVand because of that, because, rather than worrying about security,
p104
aVbecause the transformation of suffering is their end goal,
p105
aVI actually believe they are creating real safety
p106
aVand a whole new idea of security.
p107
aVI want to talk about a few of these people that I've met.
p108
aa(lp109
VTomorrow, I am going to Cairo,
p110
aVand I'm so moved that I will be with women in Cairo
p111
aVwho are V-Day women, who are opening the first safe house
p112
aVfor battered women in the Middle East.
p113
aVThat will happen because women in Cairo made a decision to stand up
p114
aVand put themselves on the line,
p115
aVand talk about the degree of violence that is happening in Egypt,
p116
aVand were willing to be attacked and criticized.
p117
aVAnd through their work over the last years,
p118
aVthis is not only happening that this house is opening,
p119
aVbut it's being supported by many factions of the society
p120
aVwho never would have supported it.
p121
aVWomen in Uganda this year,
p122
aVwho put on "The Vagina Monologues" during V-Day,
p123
aVactually evoked the wrath of the government.
p124
aa(lp125
VAnd, I love this story so much.
p126
aVThere was a cabinet meeting and a meeting of the presidents
p127
aVto talk about whether "Vaginas" could come to Uganda.
p128
aVAnd in this meeting \u2014 it went on for weeks in the press,
p129
aVtwo weeks where there was huge discussion.
p130
aVThe government finally made a decision
p131
aVthat "The Vagina Monologues" could not be performed in Uganda.
p132
aVBut the amazing news was that because they had stood up, these women,
p133
aVand because they had been willing to risk their security,
p134
aVit began a discussion that not only happened in Uganda,
p135
aVbut all of Africa.
p136
aVAs a result, this production, which had already sold out,
p137
aVevery single person in that 800-seat audience, except for 10 people,
p138
aVmade a decision to keep the money.
p139
aVThey raised 10,000 dollars on a production that never occurred.
p140
aa(lp141
VThere's a young woman named Carrie Rethlefsen in Minnesota.
p142
aVShe's a high school student.
p143
aVShe had seen "The Vagina Monologues" and she was really moved. And as a result,
p144
aVshe wore an "I heart my vagina" button to her high school in Minnesota.
p145
aa(lp146
V(Laughter)
p147
aa(lp148
VShe was basically threatened to be expelled from school.
p149
aVThey told her she couldn't love her vagina in high school,
p150
aVthat it was not a legal thing, that it was not a moral thing,
p151
aVthat it was not a good thing.
p152
aVSo she really struggled with this, what to do,
p153
aVbecause she was a senior and she was doing well in her school
p154
aVand she was threatened expulsion. So what she did is she got all her friends together \u2014
p155
aVI believe it was 100, 150 students
p156
aVall wore "I love my vagina" T-shirts,
p157
aVand the boys wore "I love her vagina" T-shirts to school.
p158
aa(lp159
V(Laughter)
p160
aa(lp161
VNow this seems like a fairly, you know, frivolous,
p162
aVbut what happened as a result of that, is that that school now
p163
aVis forming a sex education class. It's beginning to talk about sex,
p164
aVit's beginning to look at why it would be wrong
p165
aVfor a young high school girl to talk about her vagina publicly
p166
aVor to say that she loved her vagina publicly.
p167
aa(lp168
VI know I've talked about Agnes here before,
p169
aVbut I want to give you an update on Agnes.
p170
aVI met Agnes three years ago in the Rift Valley.
p171
aVWhen she was a young girl, she had been mutilated against her will.
p172
aVThat mutilation of her clitoris
p173
aVhad actually obviously impacted her life
p174
aVand changed it in a way that was devastating.
p175
aVShe made a decision not to go and get a razor or a glass shard,
p176
aVbut to devote her life to stopping that happening to other girls.
p177
aVFor eight years, she walked through the Rift Valley.
p178
aVShe had this amazing box that she carried and it had a
p179
aVtorso of a woman's body in it, a half a torso,
p180
aVand she would teach people, everywhere she went,
p181
aVwhat a healthy vagina looked like and what a mutilated vagina looked like.
p182
aVIn the years that she walked, she educated parents, mothers, fathers.
p183
aVShe saved 1,500 girls from being cut.
p184
aa(lp185
VWhen V-Day met her, we asked her how we could support her
p186
aVand she said, "Well, if you got me a Jeep,
p187
aVI could get around a lot faster." So, we bought her a Jeep.
p188
aVIn the year she had the Jeep, she saved 4,500 girls from being cut.
p189
aVSo, we said, what else could we do?
p190
aVShe said, "If you help me get money, I could open a house."
p191
aVThree years ago, Agnes opened a safe house in Africa to stop mutilation.
p192
aVWhen she began her mission eight years ago, she was reviled,
p193
aVshe was detested, she was completely slandered in her community.
p194
aVI am proud to tell you that six months ago,
p195
aVshe was elected the deputy mayor of Narok.
p196
aa(lp197
V(Applause)
p198
aa(lp199
VI think what I'm trying to say here
p200
aVis that if your end goal is security,
p201
aVand if that's all you're focusing on, what ends up happening
p202
aVis that you create not only more insecurity in other people,
p203
aVbut you make yourself far more insecure.
p204
aVReal security is contemplating death, not pretending it doesn't exist.
p205
aVNot running from loss, but entering grief, surrendering to sorrow.
p206
aVReal security is not knowing something, when you don't know it.
p207
aVReal security is hungering for connection rather than power.
p208
aVIt cannot be bought or arranged or made with bombs.
p209
aVIt is deeper, it is a process, it is acute awareness
p210
aVthat we are all utterly inter-bended,
p211
aVand one action by one being in one tiny town
p212
aVhas consequences everywhere.
p213
aVReal security is not only being able
p214
aVto tolerate mystery, complexity, ambiguity, but hungering for them
p215
aVand only trusting a situation when they are present.
p216
aa(lp217
VSomething happened when I began traveling in V-Day, eight years ago. I got lost.
p218
aVI remember being on a plane going from Kenya to South Africa,
p219
aVand I had no idea where I was.
p220
aVI didn't know where I was going, where I'd come from,
p221
aVand I panicked. I had a total anxiety attack.
p222
aVAnd then I suddenly realized that it absolutely didn't matter
p223
aVwhere I was going, or where I had come from
p224
aVbecause we are all essentially permanently displaced people.
p225
aVAll of us are refugees.
p226
aVWe come from somewhere and we are hopefully traveling all the time,
p227
aVmoving towards a new place.
p228
aVFreedom means I may not be identified as any one group,
p229
aVbut that I can visit and find myself in every group.
p230
aVIt does not mean that I don't have values or beliefs,
p231
aVbut it does mean I am not hardened around them.
p232
aVI do not use them as weapons.
p233
aVIn the shared future, it will be just that, shared.
p234
aVThe end goal will [be] becoming vulnerable,
p235
aVrealizing the place of our connection to one another,
p236
aVrather than becoming secure, in control and alone.
p237
aVThank you very much.
p238
aa(lp239
V(Applause)
p240
aa(lp241
VChris Anderson: And how are you doing? Are you exhausted?
p242
aVOn a typical day, do you wake up with hope or gloom?
p243
aVEve Ensler: You know, I think Carl Jung once said
p244
aVthat in order to survive the twentieth century,
p245
aVwe have to live with two existing thoughts, opposite thoughts, at the same time.
p246
aVAnd I think part of what I'm learning in this process
p247
aVis that one must allow oneself to feel grief.
p248
aVAnd I think as long as I keep grieving, and weeping,
p249
aVand then moving on, I'm fine.
p250
aVWhen I start to pretend that what I'm seeing isn't impacting me,
p251
aVand isn't changing my heart, then I get in trouble.
p252
aVBecause when you spend a lot of time going from place to place,
p253
aVcountry to country, and city to city,
p254
aVthe degree to which women, for example, are violated,
p255
aVand the epidemic of it, and the kind of ordinariness of it,
p256
aVis so devastating to one's soul that you have to take the time,
p257
aVor I have to take the time now, to process that.
p258
aa(lp259
VCA: There are a lot of causes out there in the world that have been talked about,
p260
aVyou know, poverty, sickness and so on. You spent eight years on this one.
p261
aVWhy this one?
p262
aVEE: I think that if you think about women,
p263
aVwomen are the primary resource of the planet. They give birth,
p264
aVwe come from them, they are mothers, they are visionaries,
p265
aVthey are the future. If you think that the U.N. now says
p266
aVthat one out of three women on the planet
p267
aVwill be raped or beaten in their lifetime,
p268
aVwe're talking about the desecration of the primary resource of the planet,
p269
aVwe're talking about the place where we come from, we're talking about parenting.
p270
aVImagine that you've been raped and you're bringing up a boy child.
p271
aVHow does it impact your ability to work, or envision a future,
p272
aVor thrive, as opposed to just survive? What I believe is
p273
aVif we could figure out how to make women safe and honor women,
p274
aVit would be parallel or equal to honoring life itself.
