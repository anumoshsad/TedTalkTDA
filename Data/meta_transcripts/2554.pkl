VI want to tell you about the future of money.
p4
aVLet's start with a story about this culture
p5
aVthat lived in Micronesia in the early 1900s, called the Yap.
p6
aVNow, I want to tell you about the Yap
p7
aVbecause their form of money is really interesting.
p8
aVThey use these limestone discs called Rai stones.
p9
aVNow, the Yap don't actually move these Rai stones around
p10
aVor exchange them the way we do with our coins,
p11
aVbecause Rai stones can get to be pretty massive.
p12
aVThe largest is about four tons and 12 feet across.
p13
aVSo the Yap just keep track of who owns part of what stone.
p14
aa(lp15
VThere's a story about these sailors
p16
aVthat were transporting a stone across the ocean
p17
aVwhen they ran into some trouble and the stone actually fell in.
p18
aVThe sailors got back to the main island
p19
aVand they told everyone what had happened.
p20
aVAnd everyone decided that, actually, yes,
p21
aVthe sailors had the stone and \u2014 why not? \u2014 it still counted.
p22
aVEven though it was at the bottom of the ocean,
p23
aVit was still part of the Yap economy.
p24
aa(lp25
VYou might think that this was just a small culture
p26
aVa hundred years ago.
p27
aVBut things like this happen in the Western world as well,
p28
aVand the Yap actually still use a form of these stones.
p29
aa(lp30
VIn 1932, the Bank of France asked the United States
p31
aVto convert their holdings from dollars into gold.
p32
aVBut it was too inconvenient to think about actually shipping
p33
aVall of that gold over to Europe.
p34
aVSo instead, someone went to where that gold was being stored
p35
aVand they just labeled it as belonging to France now.
p36
aVAnd everyone agreed that France owned the gold.
p37
aVIt's just like those Rai stones.
p38
aa(lp39
VThe point I want to make with these two examples
p40
aVis that there's nothing inherently valuable
p41
aVabout a dollar or a stone or a coin.
p42
aVThe only reason these things have any value
p43
aVis because we've all decided they should.
p44
aVAnd because we've decided that,
p45
aVthey do.
p46
aVMoney is about the exchanges and the transactions
p47
aVthat we have with each other.
p48
aVMoney isn't anything objective.
p49
aVIt's about a collective story that we tell each other about value.
p50
aVA collective fiction.
p51
aVAnd that's a really powerful concept.
p52
aa(lp53
VIn the past two decades,
p54
aVwe've begun to use digital money.
p55
aVSo I get paid via direct deposit,
p56
aVI pay my rent via bank transfer,
p57
aVI pay my taxes online.
p58
aVAnd every month,
p59
aVa small amount of money is deducted from my paycheck
p60
aVand invested in mutual funds in my retirement account.
p61
aVAll of these interactions
p62
aVare literally just changing 1's and 0's on computers.
p63
aVThere's not even anything physical, like a stone or a coin.
p64
aVDigital money makes it so that I can pay someone around the world
p65
aVin seconds.
p66
aa(lp67
VNow when this works,
p68
aVit's because there are large institutions underwriting every 1 or 0
p69
aVthat changes on a computer.
p70
aVAnd when it doesn't,
p71
aVit's often the fault of those large institutions.
p72
aVOr at least, it's up to them to fix the problem.
p73
aVAnd a lot of times, they don't.
p74
aVThere's a lot of friction in the system.
p75
aVHow long did it take the US credit card companies
p76
aVto implement chip and pin?
p77
aVHalf my credit cards still don't work in Europe.
p78
aVThat's friction.
p79
aVTransferring money across borders and across currencies
p80
aVis really expensive:
p81
aVfriction.
p82
aVAn entrepreneur in India can set up an online business in minutes,
p83
aVbut it's hard for her to get loans and to get paid:
p84
aVfriction.
p85
aVOur access to digital money and our ability to freely transact
p86
aVis being held captive by these gatekeepers.
p87
aVAnd there's a lot of impediments in the system slowing things down.
p88
aa(lp89
VThat's because digital money isn't really mine,
p90
aVit's entries in databases that belong to my bank,
p91
aVmy credit card company or my investment firm.
p92
aVAnd these companies have the right to say "no."
p93
aVIf I'm a PayPal merchant
p94
aVand PayPal wrongly flags me for fraud,
p95
aVthat's it.
p96
aVMy account gets frozen, and I can't get paid.
p97
aa(lp98
VThese institutions are standing in the way of innovation.
p99
aVHow many of you use Facebook photos, Google Photos,
p100
aVInstagram?
p101
aVMy photos are everywhere.
p102
aVThey are on my phone, they're on my laptop,
p103
aVthey're on my old phone, they're in Dropbox.
p104
aVThey're on all these different websites and services.
p105
aVAnd most of these services don't work together.
p106
aVThey don't inter-operate.
p107
aVAnd as a result,
p108
aVmy photo library is a mess.
p109
aa(lp110
VThe same thing happens
p111
aVwhen institutions control the money supply.
p112
aVA lot of these services don't inter-operate,
p113
aVand as a result, this blocks what we can do with payment.
p114
aVAnd it makes transaction costs go up.
p115
aVSo far, we've been through two phases of money.
p116
aVIn an analog world, we had to deal with these physical objects,
p117
aVand money moved at a certain speed \u2014 the speed of humans.
p118
aVIn a digital world, money can reach much farther and is much faster,
p119
aVbut we're at the mercy of these gatekeeper institutions.
p120
aVMoney only moves at the speed of banks.
p121
aa(lp122
VWe're about to enter a new phase of money.
p123
aVThe future of money is programmable.
p124
aVWhen we combine software and currency,
p125
aVmoney becomes more than just a static unit of value,
p126
aVand we don't have to rely on institutions for security.
p127
aVIn a programmable world,
p128
aVwe remove humans and institutions from the loop.
p129
aVAnd when this happens,
p130
aVwe won't even feel like we're transacting anymore.
p131
aVMoney will be directed by software,
p132
aVand it will just safely and securely flow.
p133
aa(lp134
VCryptocurrencies are the first step of this evolution.
p135
aVCryptocurrencies are digital money
p136
aVthat isn't run by any government or bank.
p137
aVIt's money designed to work in a world without intermediaries.
p138
aVBitcoin is the most ubiquitous cryptocurrency,
p139
aVbut there are hundreds of them.
p140
aVThere's Ethereum, Litecoin, Stellar, Dogecoin,
p141
aVand those are just a few of the more popular ones.
p142
aVAnd these things are real money.
p143
aVThe sushi restaurant down my street
p144
aVtakes Bitcoin.
p145
aVI have an app on my phone that I can use to buy sashimi.
p146
aVBut it's not just for small transactions.
p147
aVIn March, there was a transaction that moved around 100,000 bitcoins.
p148
aVThat's the equivalent of 40 million US dollars.
p149
aa(lp150
VCryptocurrencies are based on a special field of mathematics
p151
aVcalled cryptography.
p152
aVCryptography is the study of how to secure communication,
p153
aVand it's about two really important things:
p154
aVmasking information so it can be hidden in plain sight,
p155
aVand verifying a piece of information's source.
p156
aVCryptography underpins so many of the systems around us.
p157
aVAnd it's so powerful that at times
p158
aVthe US government has actually classified it as a weapon.
p159
aa(lp160
VDuring World War II, breaking cryptosystems like Enigma
p161
aVwas critical to decoding enemy transmissions
p162
aVand turning the tide of the war.
p163
aVToday, anyone with a modern web browser is running
p164
aVa pretty sophisticated cryptosystem.
p165
aVIt's what we use to secure our interactions on the Internet.
p166
aVIt's what makes it safe for us to type our passwords in
p167
aVand to send financial information to websites.
p168
aVSo what the banks used to give us \u2014
p169
aVtrustworthy digital money transfer \u2014
p170
aVwe can now get with a clever application of cryptography.
p171
aVAnd this means that we don't have to rely on the banks anymore
p172
aVto secure our transactions.
p173
aVWe can do it ourselves.
p174
aa(lp175
VBitcoin is based on the very same idea that the Yap used,
p176
aVthis collective global knowledge of transfers.
p177
aVIn Bitcoin, I spend by transferring Bitcoin,
p178
aVand I get paid when someone transfers Bitcoin to me.
p179
aa(lp180
VImagine that we had this magic paper.
p181
aVSo the way that this paper works is I can give you a sheet of it
p182
aVand if you write something on it,
p183
aVit will magically appear on my piece as well.
p184
aVLet's say we just give everyone this paper
p185
aVand everyone writes down the transfers that they're doing
p186
aVin the Bitcoin system.
p187
aVAll of these transfers get copied around to everyone else's pieces of paper.
p188
aVAnd I can look at mine
p189
aVand I'll have a list of all of the transfers that are happening
p190
aVin the entire Bitcoin economy.
p191
aVThis is actually what's happening with the Bitcoin blockchain,
p192
aVwhich is a list of all of the transactions in Bitcoin.
p193
aVExcept, it's not done through paper.
p194
aVIt's done through computer code,
p195
aVrunning on thousands of networked computers
p196
aVaround the world.
p197
aVAll of these computers are collectively confirming
p198
aVwho owns what Bitcoin.
p199
aVSo the Bitcoin blockchain is core to how Bitcoin works.
p200
aa(lp201
VBut where do bitcoins actually come from?
p202
aVWell, the code is designed to create new Bitcoin
p203
aVaccording to a schedule.
p204
aVAnd the way that it works is that to get those Bitcoin,
p205
aVI have to solve a puzzle \u2014 a random cryptographic puzzle.
p206
aVImagine that we had 15 dice,
p207
aVand we were throwing these dice over and over again.
p208
aVWhenever the dice come up all sixes,
p209
aVwe say that we win.
p210
aVThis is very close to what these computers are all actually doing.
p211
aVThey're trying over and over again to land on the right number.
p212
aVAnd when they do,
p213
aVwe say that they've solved the puzzle.
p214
aa(lp215
VThe computer that solves the puzzle
p216
aVpublishes its solution to the rest of the network
p217
aVand collects its reward: new bitcoins.
p218
aVAnd in the act of solving this puzzle,
p219
aVthese computers are actually helping to secure the Bitcoin blockchain
p220
aVand add to the list of transactions.
p221
aa(lp222
VThere are actually people all over the world running this software,
p223
aVand we call them Bitcoin miners.
p224
aVAnyone can become a Bitcoin miner.
p225
aVYou can go download the software right now
p226
aVand run it in your computer and try to collect some bitcoins.
p227
aVI can't say that I would recommend it,
p228
aVbecause right now, the puzzle is so hard and the network is so powerful,
p229
aVthat if I tried to mine Bitcoin on my laptop,
p230
aVI probably wouldn't see any for about two million years.
p231
aVThe miners, professional miners, use this special hardware
p232
aVthat's designed to solve the puzzle really fast.
p233
aVNow, the Bitcoin network and all of this special hardware,
p234
aVthere are estimates that the amount of energy it uses
p235
aVis equivalent to that of a small country.
p236
aVSo, the first set of cryptocurrencies
p237
aVare a little bit slow and a little bit cumbersome.
p238
aVBut the next generation is going to be so much better and so much faster.
p239
aa(lp240
VCryptocurrencies are the first step
p241
aVto a world with a global programmable money.
p242
aVAnd in a world with programmable money,
p243
aVI can pay anyone else securely
p244
aVwithout having to sign up or ask permission,
p245
aVor do a conversion or worry about my money getting stuck.
p246
aVAnd I can send money around the world.
p247
aVThis is a really amazing thing.
p248
aVIt's the idea of permission-less innovation.
p249
aVThe Internet caused an explosion of innovation,
p250
aVbecause it was built upon an open architecture.
p251
aVAnd just like the Internet changed the way we communicate,
p252
aVprogrammable money is going to change the way we pay,
p253
aVallocate and decide on value.
p254
aa(lp255
VSo what kind of world does programmable money create?
p256
aVImagine a world where I can rent out my healthcare data
p257
aVto a pharmaceutical company.
p258
aVThey can run large-scale data analysis
p259
aVand provide me with a cryptographic proof
p260
aVthat shows they're only using my data in a way that we agreed.
p261
aVAnd they can pay me for what they find out.
p262
aVInstead of signing up for streaming services
p263
aVand getting a cable bill,
p264
aVwhat if my television analyzed my watching habits
p265
aVand recommended well-priced content that fit within my budget
p266
aVthat I would enjoy?
p267
aVImagine an Internet without ads,
p268
aVbecause instead of paying with our attention when we view content,
p269
aVwe just pay.
p270
aa(lp271
VInterestingly, things like micro-payments
p272
aVare actually going to change the way security works in our world,
p273
aVbecause once we're better able to allocate value,
p274
aVpeople will use their money and their energies
p275
aVfor more constructive things.
p276
aVIf it cost a fraction of a cent to send an email,
p277
aVwould we still have spam?
p278
aa(lp279
VWe're not at this world yet,
p280
aVbut it's coming.
p281
aVRight now, it's like we're in a world that is seeing the first automobile.
p282
aVThe first cryptocurrency, like the first car,
p283
aVis slow and hard to understand and hard to use.
p284
aVDigital money, like the horse and carriage,
p285
aVworks pretty well,
p286
aVand the whole world economy is built on it.
p287
aVIf you were the first person on your block
p288
aVto get a car with an internal combustion engine,
p289
aVyour neighbors would probably think you were crazy:
p290
aV"Why would you want this large, clunky machine
p291
aVthat breaks down all the time, that lights on fire,
p292
aVand is still slower than a horse?"
p293
aVBut we all know how that story turns out.
p294
aa(lp295
VWe're entering a new era of programmable money.
p296
aVAnd it's very exciting, but it's also a little bit scary.
p297
aVCryptocurrencies can be used for illegal transactions,
p298
aVjust like cash is used for crime in the world today.
p299
aVWhen all of our transactions are online,
p300
aVwhat does that mean for surveillance \u2014 who can see what we do?
p301
aVWho's advantaged in this new world and who isn't?
p302
aVWill I have to start to pay for things that I didn't have to pay for before?
p303
aVWill we all become slaves to algorithms and utility functions?
p304
aa(lp305
VAll new technology comes with trade-offs.
p306
aVThe Internet brought us a lot of ways to waste time.
p307
aVBut it also greatly increased productivity.
p308
aVMobile phones are annoying
p309
aVbecause they make me feel like I have to stay connected to work
p310
aVall the time.
p311
aVBut they also help me stay connected to friends and family.
p312
aVThe new sharing economy is going to eliminate some jobs.
p313
aVBut it's also going to create new, flexible forms of employment.
p314
aVWith programmable money,
p315
aVwe decouple the need for large, trusted institutions
p316
aVfrom the architecture of the network.
p317
aVAnd this pushes innovation in money out to the edges, where it belongs.
p318
aVProgrammable money democratizes money.
p319
aVAnd because of this, things are going to change and unfold
p320
aVin ways that we can't even predict.
p321
