VShall I ask for a show of hands or a clapping
p4
aVof people in different generations?
p5
aVI'm interested in how many are three to 12 years old.
p6
aa(lp7
V(Laughter)
p8
aa(lp9
VNone, huh?
p10
aa(lp11
V(Laughter)
p12
aVAll right.
p13
aVI'm going to talk about dinosaurs.
p14
aVDo you remember dinosaurs when you were that age?
p15
aa(lp16
V(Applause)
p17
aa(lp18
VDinosaurs are kind of funny, you know.
p19
aa(lp20
V(Laughter)
p21
aa(lp22
VWe're going to kind of go in a different direction right now.
p23
aVI hope you all realize that.
p24
aVSo I'll just give you my message up front:
p25
aVTry not to go extinct.
p26
aa(lp27
V(Laughter)
p28
aa(lp29
VThat's it.
p30
aa(lp31
V(Laughter)
p32
aa(lp33
VPeople ask me a lot \u2014
p34
aVin fact, one of the most asked questions I get
p35
aVis, why do children like dinosaurs so much?
p36
aVWhat's the fascination?
p37
aVAnd I usually just say,
p38
aV"Well, dinosaurs were big,
p39
aVdifferent and gone."
p40
aVThey're all gone.
p41
aVWell that's not true,
p42
aVbut we'll get to the goose in a minute.
p43
aVSo that's sort of the theme:
p44
aVbig, different and gone.
p45
aVThe title of my talk:
p46
aVShape-shifting Dinosaurs:
p47
aVThe cause of a premature extinction.
p48
aa(lp49
VNow I assume that we remember dinosaurs.
p50
aVAnd there's lots of different shapes.
p51
aVLots of different kinds.
p52
aVA long time ago,
p53
aVback in the early 1900s, museums were out looking for dinosaurs.
p54
aVThey went out and gathered them up.
p55
aVAnd this is an interesting story.
p56
aVEvery museum wanted a little bigger or better one than anybody else had.
p57
aVSo if the museum in Toronto went out and collected a Tyrannosaur, a big one,
p58
aVthen the museum in Ottawa wanted a bigger one, and a better one.
p59
aVAnd that happened for all museums.
p60
aVSo everyone was out looking for all these bigger and better dinosaurs.
p61
aVAnd this was in the early 1900s.
p62
aa(lp63
VBy about 1970,
p64
aVsome scientists were sitting around and they thought, "What in the world \u2014
p65
aVLook at these dinosaurs, they're all big.
p66
aVWhere are all the little ones?"
p67
aa(lp68
V(Laughter)
p69
aa(lp70
VAnd they thought about it and they even wrote papers about it:
p71
aV"Where are the little dinosaurs?"
p72
aa(lp73
V(Laughter)
p74
aa(lp75
VWell, go to a museum, you'll see,
p76
aVsee how many baby dinosaurs there are.
p77
aVPeople assumed \u2014 and this was actually a problem \u2014
p78
aVpeople assumed that if they had little dinosaurs,
p79
aVif they had juvenile dinosaurs, they'd be easy to identify.
p80
aVYou'd have a big dinosaur and a littler dinosaur.
p81
aa(lp82
V(Laughter)
p83
aa(lp84
VBut all they had were big dinosaurs.
p85
aa(lp86
VAnd it comes down to a couple of things.
p87
aVFirst off, scientists have egos,
p88
aVand scientists like to name dinosaurs.
p89
aVThey like to name anything.
p90
aVEverybody likes to have their own animal that they named.
p91
aa(lp92
V(Laughter)
p93
aa(lp94
VAnd so every time they found something that looked a little different,
p95
aVthey named it something different.
p96
aVAnd what happened, of course,
p97
aVis we ended up with a whole bunch of different dinosaurs.
p98
aa(lp99
VIn 1975,
p100
aVa light went on in somebody's head.
p101
aVDr. Peter Dodson at the University of Pennsylvania
p102
aVactually realized that dinosaurs grew kind of like birds do,
p103
aVwhich is different than the way reptiles grow.
p104
aVAnd in fact,
p105
aVhe used the cassowary as an example.
p106
aVAnd it's kind of cool \u2014 if you look at the cassowary,
p107
aVor any of the birds that have crests on their heads,
p108
aVthey grow to about 80 percent adult size before the crest starts to grow.
p109
aVNow think about that.
p110
aVThey're basically retaining their juvenile characteristics
p111
aVvery late in what we call ontogeny.
p112
aVSo allometric cranial ontogeny is relative skull growth.
p113
aVSo you can see that if you actually found one that was 80 percent grown
p114
aVand you didn't know that it was going to grow up to a cassowary,
p115
aVyou would think they were two different animals.
p116
aa(lp117
VSo this was a problem,
p118
aVand Peter Dodson pointed this out using some duck-billed dinosaurs
p119
aVthen called Hypacrosaurus.
p120
aVAnd he showed that if you were to take a baby and an adult
p121
aVand make an average of what it should look like,
p122
aVif it grew in sort of a linear fashion,
p123
aVit would have a crest about half the size of the adult.
p124
aVBut the actual subadult at 65 percent had no crest at all.
p125
aVSo this was interesting.
p126
aVSo this is where people went astray again.
p127
aVI mean, if they'd have just taken that,
p128
aVtaken Peter Dodson's work, and gone on with that,
p129
aVthen we would have a lot less dinosaurs than we have.
p130
aVBut scientists have egos; they like to name things.
p131
aVAnd so they went on naming dinosaurs because they were different.
p132
aa(lp133
VNow we have a way of actually testing
p134
aVto see whether a dinosaur, or any animal, is a young one or an older one.
p135
aVAnd that's by actually cutting into their bones.
p136
aVBut cutting into the bones of a dinosaur is hard to do, as you can imagine,
p137
aVbecause in museums, bones are precious.
p138
aVYou go into a museum, and they take really good care of them.
p139
aVThey put them in foam, little containers.
p140
aVThey're very well taken care of.
p141
aVThey don't like it if you come in and want to saw them open and look inside.
p142
aa(lp143
V(Laughter)
p144
aa(lp145
VSo they don't normally let you do that.
p146
aa(lp147
V(Laughter)
p148
aa(lp149
VBut I have a museum and I collect dinosaurs
p150
aVand I can saw mine open.
p151
aVSo that's what I do.
p152
aa(lp153
V(Applause)
p154
aa(lp155
VSo if you cut open a little dinosaur,
p156
aVit's very spongy inside, like A.
p157
aVAnd if you cut into an older dinosaur, it's very massive.
p158
aVYou can tell it's mature bone.
p159
aVSo it's real easy to tell them apart.
p160
aVSo what I want to do is show you these.
p161
aVIn North America in the northern plains of the United States
p162
aVand the southern plains of Alberta and Saskatchewan,
p163
aVthere's this unit of rock called the Hell Creek Formation
p164
aVthat produces the last dinosaurs that lived on Earth.
p165
aVAnd there are 12 of them that everyone recognizes \u2014
p166
aVI mean the 12 primary dinosaurs that went extinct.
p167
aVAnd so we will evaluate them.
p168
aVAnd that's sort of what I've been doing.
p169
aVSo my students, my staff, we've been cutting them open.
p170
aVNow as you can imagine, cutting open a leg bone is one thing,
p171
aVbut when you go to a museum
p172
aVand say, "You don't mind if I cut open your dinosaur's skull, do you?"
p173
aVthey say, "Go away."
p174
aa(lp175
V(Laughter)
p176
aa(lp177
VSo here are 12 dinosaurs.
p178
aVAnd we want to look at these three first.
p179
aa(lp180
VSo these are dinosaurs that are called Pachycephalosaurus.
p181
aVAnd everybody knows that these three animals are related.
p182
aVAnd the assumption is that they're related like cousins or whatever.
p183
aVBut no one ever considered that they might be more closely related.
p184
aVIn other words,
p185
aVpeople looked at them and they saw the differences.
p186
aVAnd you all know that if you are going to determine
p187
aVwhether you're related to your brother or your sister,
p188
aVyou can't do it by looking at differences.
p189
aVYou can only determine relatedness by looking for similarities.
p190
aa(lp191
VSo people were looking at these
p192
aVand they were talking about how different they are.
p193
aVPachycephalosaurus has a big, thick dome on its head,
p194
aVand it's got some little bumps on the back of its head,
p195
aVand it's got a bunch of gnarly things on the end of its nose.
p196
aVAnd then Stygimoloch, another dinosaur from the same age, lived at the same time,
p197
aVhas spikes sticking out the back of its head.
p198
aVIt's got a little, tiny dome,
p199
aVand it's got a bunch of gnarly stuff on its nose.
p200
aVAnd then there's this thing called Dracorex hogwartsia.
p201
aVGuess where that came from?
p202
aVDragon.
p203
aVSo here's a dinosaur that has spikes sticking out of its head,
p204
aVno dome and gnarly stuff on its nose.
p205
aa(lp206
VNobody noticed the gnarly stuff sort of looked alike.
p207
aVBut they did look at these three
p208
aVand they said, "These are three different dinosaurs,
p209
aVand Dracorex is probably the most primitive of them.
p210
aVAnd the other one is more primitive than the other."
p211
aVIt's unclear to me how they actually sorted these three of them out.
p212
aVBut if you line them up,
p213
aVif you just take those three skulls and just line them up,
p214
aVthey line up like this.
p215
aVDracorex is the littlest one,
p216
aVStygimoloch is the middle-size one,
p217
aVPachycephalosaurus is the largest one.
p218
aVAnd one would think, that should give me a clue.
p219
aa(lp220
V(Laughter)
p221
aa(lp222
VBut it didn't give them a clue.
p223
aa(lp224
V(Laughter)
p225
aa(lp226
VBecause, well we know why.
p227
aVScientists like to name things.
p228
aa(lp229
VSo if we cut open Dracorex \u2014
p230
aVI cut open our Dracorex \u2014
p231
aVand look, it was spongy inside, really spongy inside.
p232
aVI mean, it is a juvenile and it's growing really fast.
p233
aVSo it is going to get bigger.
p234
aVIf you cut open Stygimoloch, it is doing the same thing.
p235
aVThe dome, that little dome, is growing really fast.
p236
aVIt's inflating very fast.
p237
aVWhat's interesting is the spike on the back of the Dracorex
p238
aVwas growing very fast as well.
p239
aVThe spikes on the back of the Stygimoloch are actually resorbing,
p240
aVwhich means they're getting smaller as that dome is getting bigger.
p241
aVAnd if we look at Pachycephalosaurus,
p242
aVPachycephalosaurus has a solid dome
p243
aVand its little bumps on the back of its head were also resorbing.
p244
aa(lp245
VSo just with these three dinosaurs,
p246
aVas a scientist, we can easily hypothesize
p247
aVthat it is just a growth series of the same animal.
p248
aVWhich of course means
p249
aVthat Stygimoloch and Dracorex are extinct.
p250
aa(lp251
V(Laughter)
p252
aa(lp253
VOK.
p254
aa(lp255
V(Laughter)
p256
aa(lp257
VWhich of course means we have 10 primary dinosaurs to deal with.
p258
aa(lp259
VSo a colleague of mine at Berkeley \u2014 he and I were looking at Triceratops.
p260
aVAnd before the year 2000 \u2014
p261
aVnow remember, Triceratops was first found in the 1800s \u2014
p262
aVbefore 2000, no one had ever seen a juvenile Triceratops.
p263
aVThere's a Triceratops in every museum in the world,
p264
aVbut no one had ever collected a juvenile.
p265
aVAnd we know why, right?
p266
aVBecause everybody wants to have a big one.
p267
aVSo everyone had a big one.
p268
aVSo we went out and collected a whole bunch of stuff
p269
aVand we found a whole bunch of little ones.
p270
aVThey're everywhere, they're all over the place.
p271
aVSo we have a whole bunch of them at our museum.
p272
aa(lp273
V(Laughter)
p274
aa(lp275
VAnd everybody says it's because I have a little museum.
p276
aVWhen you have a little museum, you have little dinosaurs.
p277
aa(lp278
V(Laughter)
p279
aa(lp280
VIf you look at the Triceratops,
p281
aVyou can see it's changing, it's shape-shifting.
p282
aVAs the juveniles are growing up, their horns actually curve backwards.
p283
aVAnd then as they get older, the horns grow forward.
p284
aVAnd that's pretty cool.
p285
aVIf you look along the edge of the frill,
p286
aVthey have these little triangular bones that actually grow big as triangles
p287
aVand then they flatten against the frill
p288
aVpretty much like the spikes do on the Pachycephalosaurs.
p289
aVAnd then, because the juveniles are in my collection,
p290
aVI cut them open ...
p291
aa(lp292
V(Laughter)
p293
aa(lp294
Vand look inside.
p295
aVAnd the little one is really spongy.
p296
aVAnd the middle-size one is really spongy.
p297
aVBut what was interesting was the adult Triceratops was also spongy.
p298
aVAnd this is a skull that is two meters long.
p299
aVIt's a big skull.
p300
aa(lp301
VBut there's another dinosaur that is found in this formation
p302
aVthat looks like a Triceratops, except it's bigger,
p303
aVand it's called Torosaurus.
p304
aVAnd Torosaurus, when we cut into it, has mature bone.
p305
aVBut it's got these big holes in its shield.
p306
aVAnd everybody says,
p307
aV"A Triceratops and a Torosaurus can't possibly be the same animal
p308
aVbecause one of them's bigger than the other one."
p309
aa(lp310
V(Laughter)
p311
aa(lp312
V"And it has holes in its frill."
p313
aVAnd I said, "Well do we have any juvenile Torosauruses?"
p314
aVAnd they said, "Well, no, but it has holes in its frill."
p315
aa(lp316
VSo one of my graduate students, John Scannella,
p317
aVlooked through our whole collection
p318
aVand he actually discovered that the hole starting to form in Triceratops
p319
aVand, of course it's open, in Torosaurus \u2014
p320
aVso he found the transitional ones between Triceratops and Torosaurus,
p321
aVwhich was pretty cool.
p322
aVSo now we know that Torosaurus is actually a grown-up Triceratops.
p323
aVNow when we name dinosaurs,
p324
aVwhen we name anything, the original name gets to stick
p325
aVand the second name is thrown out.
p326
aVSo Torosaurus is extinct.
p327
aVTriceratops, if you've heard the news, a lot of the newscasters got it all wrong.
p328
aVThey thought Torosaurus should be kept and Triceratops thrown out,
p329
aVbut that's not going to happen.
p330
aa(lp331
V(Laughter)
p332
aa(lp333
VAll right, so we can do this with a bunch of dinosaurs.
p334
aVI mean, here's Edmontosaurus
p335
aVand Anatotitan.
p336
aVAnatotitan: giant duck.
p337
aVIt's a giant duck-bill dinosaur.
p338
aVHere's another one.
p339
aVSo we look at the bone histology.
p340
aVThe bone histology tells us that Edmontosaurus is a juvenile,
p341
aVor at least a subadult,
p342
aVand the other one is an adult, and we have an ontogeny.
p343
aVAnd we get rid of Anatotitan.
p344
aa(lp345
VSo we can just keep doing this.
p346
aVAnd the last one is T. Rex.
p347
aVSo there's these two dinosaurs, T. Rex and Nanotyrannus.
p348
aa(lp349
V(Laughter)
p350
aa(lp351
VAgain, it makes you wonder.
p352
aa(lp353
V(Laughter)
p354
aa(lp355
VBut they had a good question.
p356
aVThey were looking at them and they said, "One's got 17 teeth,
p357
aVand the biggest one's got 12 teeth.
p358
aVAnd that doesn't make any sense at all,
p359
aVbecause we don't know of any dinosaurs that gain teeth as they get older.
p360
aVSo it must be true \u2014
p361
aVthey must be different."
p362
aVSo we cut into them.
p363
aVAnd sure enough, Nanotyrannus has juvenile bone
p364
aVand the bigger one has more mature bone.
p365
aVIt looks like it could still get bigger.
p366
aVAnd at the Museum of the Rockies where we work,
p367
aVI have four T. rexes, so I can cut a whole bunch of them.
p368
aVBut I didn't have to cut any of them really,
p369
aVbecause I just lined up their jaws
p370
aVand it turned out the biggest one had 12 teeth
p371
aVand the next smallest one had 13
p372
aVand the next smallest had 14.
p373
aVAnd of course, Nano has 17.
p374
aVAnd we just went out and looked at other people's collections
p375
aVand we found one that has sort of 15 teeth.
p376
aVSo again, real easy to say
p377
aVthat Tyrannosaurus ontogeny included Nanotyrannus,
p378
aVand therefore we can take out another dinosaur.
p379
aa(lp380
V(Laughter)
p381
aa(lp382
VSo when it comes down to our end Cretaceous,
p383
aVwe have seven left.
p384
aVAnd that's a good number.
p385
aVThat's a good number to go extinct, I think.
p386
aVNow as you can imagine,
p387
aVthis is not very popular with fourth-graders.
p388
aa(lp389
V(Laughter)
p390
aa(lp391
VFourth-graders love their dinosaurs, they memorize them.
p392
aVAnd they're not happy with this.
p393
aa(lp394
V(Laughter)
p395
aa(lp396
VThank you very much.
