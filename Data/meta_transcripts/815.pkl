VNow, I want to start with a question:
p4
aVWhen was the last time you were called "childish"?
p5
aVFor kids like me,
p6
aVbeing called childish can be a frequent occurrence.
p7
aVEvery time we make irrational demands,
p8
aVexhibit irresponsible behavior,
p9
aVor display any other signs of being normal American citizens,
p10
aVwe are called childish.
p11
aVWhich really bothers me.
p12
aVAfter all, take a look at these events:
p13
aVImperialism and colonization,
p14
aVworld wars, George W. Bush.
p15
aVAsk yourself, who's responsible? Adults.
p16
aa(lp17
VNow, what have kids done?
p18
aVWell, Anne Frank touched millions
p19
aVwith her powerful account of the Holocaust.
p20
aVRuby Bridges helped to end segregation in the United States.
p21
aVAnd, most recently,
p22
aVCharlie Simpson helped to raise 120,000 pounds for Haiti,
p23
aVon his little bike.
p24
aVSo as you can see evidenced by such examples,
p25
aVage has absolutely nothing to do with it.
p26
aVThe traits the word "childish" addresses are seen so often in adults,
p27
aVthat we should abolish this age-discriminatory word,
p28
aVwhen it comes to criticizing behavior associated with irresponsibility
p29
aVand irrational thinking.
p30
aa(lp31
V(Applause)
p32
aa(lp33
VThank you.
p34
aa(lp35
VThen again, who's to say that certain types of irrational thinking
p36
aVaren't exactly what the world needs?
p37
aVMaybe you've had grand plans before,
p38
aVbut stopped yourself, thinking,
p39
aV"That's impossible," or "That costs too much,"
p40
aVor "That won't benefit me."
p41
aVFor better or worse, we kids aren't hampered as much
p42
aVwhen it comes to thinking about reasons why not to do things.
p43
aVKids can be full of inspiring aspirations and hopeful thinking,
p44
aVlike my wish that no one went hungry,
p45
aVor that everything were free, a kind of utopia.
p46
aVHow many of you still dream like that, and believe in the possibilities?
p47
aVSometimes a knowledge of history and the past failures of Utopian ideals
p48
aVcan be a burden,
p49
aVbecause you know that if everything were free,
p50
aVthen the food stocks would become depleted and scarce and lead to chaos.
p51
aVOn the other hand, we kids still dream about perfection.
p52
aVAnd that's a good thing, because in order to make anything a reality,
p53
aVyou have to dream about it first.
p54
aa(lp55
VIn many ways, our audacity to imagine
p56
aVhelps push the boundaries of possibility.
p57
aVFor instance, the Museum of Glass in Tacoma, Washington,
p58
aVmy home state \u2014 yoohoo, Washington!
p59
aa(lp60
V(Applause)
p61
aa(lp62
Vhas a program called Kids Design Glass,
p63
aVand kids draw their own ideas for glass art.
p64
aVThe resident artist said they got some of their best ideas
p65
aVfrom the program, because kids don't think about the limitations
p66
aVof how hard it can be to blow glass into certain shapes,
p67
aVthey just think of good ideas.
p68
aVNow, when you think of glass, you might think of colorful Chihuly designs,
p69
aVor maybe Italian vases,
p70
aVbut kids challenge glass artists to go beyond that,
p71
aVinto the realm of brokenhearted snakes
p72
aVand bacon boys, who you can see has meat vision.
p73
aa(lp74
V(Laughter)
p75
aa(lp76
VNow, our inherent wisdom doesn't have to be insider's knowledge.
p77
aVKids already do a lot of learning from adults,
p78
aVand we have a lot to share.
p79
aVI think that adults should start learning from kids.
p80
aVNow, I do most of my speaking
p81
aVin front of an education crowd \u2014 teachers and students,
p82
aVand I like this analogy:
p83
aVIt shouldn't be a teacher at the head of the class,
p84
aVtelling students, "Do this, do that."
p85
aVThe students should teach their teachers.
p86
aVLearning between grown-ups and kids should be reciprocal.
p87
aVThe reality, unfortunately, is a little different,
p88
aVand it has a lot to do with trust, or a lack of it.
p89
aa(lp90
VNow, if you don't trust someone, you place restrictions on them, right?
p91
aVIf I doubt my older sister's ability to pay back the 10 percent interest
p92
aVI established on her last loan,
p93
aVI'm going to withhold her ability to get more money from me,
p94
aVuntil she pays it back.
p95
aa(lp96
V(Laughter)
p97
aa(lp98
VTrue story, by the way.
p99
aVNow, adults seem to have
p100
aVa prevalently restrictive attitude towards kids,
p101
aVfrom every "Don't do that, don't do this" in the school handbook,
p102
aVto restrictions on school Internet use.
p103
aVAs history points out, regimes become oppressive
p104
aVwhen they're fearful about keeping control.
p105
aVAnd although adults may not be quite at the level
p106
aVof totalitarian regimes,
p107
aVkids have no or very little say in making the rules,
p108
aVwhen really, the attitude should be reciprocal,
p109
aVmeaning that the adult population should learn
p110
aVand take into account the wishes of the younger population.
p111
aa(lp112
VNow, what's even worse than restriction,
p113
aVis that adults often underestimate kids' abilities.
p114
aVWe love challenges, but when expectations are low,
p115
aVtrust me, we will sink to them.
p116
aVMy own parents had anything but low expectations
p117
aVfor me and my sister.
p118
aVOkay, so they didn't tell us to become doctors or lawyers or anything like that,
p119
aVbut my dad did read to us about Aristotle and pioneer germ-fighters,
p120
aVwhen lots of other kids were hearing
p121
aV"The Wheels on the Bus Go Round and Round."
p122
aVWell, we heard that one too, but "Pioneer Germ Fighters" totally rules.
p123
aa(lp124
V(Laughter)
p125
aa(lp126
VI loved to write from the age of four, and when I was six,
p127
aVmy mom bought me my own laptop equipped with Microsoft Word.
p128
aVThank you, Bill Gates, and thank you, Ma.
p129
aVI wrote over 300 short stories on that little laptop,
p130
aVand I wanted to get published.
p131
aVInstead of just scoffing at this heresy that a kid wanted to get published,
p132
aVor saying wait until you're older,
p133
aVmy parents were really supportive.
p134
aVMany publishers were not quite so encouraging.
p135
aVOne large children's publisher ironically said
p136
aVthat they didn't work with children.
p137
aVChildren's publisher not working with children?
p138
aVI don't know, you're kind of alienating a large client there.
p139
aa(lp140
V(Laughter)
p141
aa(lp142
VOne publisher, Action Publishing, was willing to take that leap and trust me,
p143
aVand to listen to what I had to say.
p144
aVThey published my first book, "Flying Fingers," you see it here.
p145
aVAnd from there on, it's gone to speaking at hundreds of schools,
p146
aVkeynoting to thousands of educators,
p147
aVand finally, today, speaking to you.
p148
aa(lp149
VI appreciate your attention today,
p150
aVbecause to show that you truly care, you listen.
p151
aVBut there's a problem with this rosy picture
p152
aVof kids being so much better than adults.
p153
aVKids grow up and become adults just like you.
p154
aa(lp155
V(Laughter)
p156
aa(lp157
VOr just like you? Really?
p158
aVThe goal is not to turn kids into your kind of adult,
p159
aVbut rather, better adults than you have been,
p160
aVwhich may be a little challenging, considering your guys' credentials.
p161
aa(lp162
V(Laughter)
p163
aa(lp164
VBut the way progress happens,
p165
aVis because new generations and new eras
p166
aVgrow and develop and become better than the previous ones.
p167
aVIt's the reason we're not in the Dark Ages anymore.
p168
aVNo matter your position or place in life,
p169
aVit is imperative to create opportunities for children,
p170
aVso that we can grow up to blow you away.
p171
aa(lp172
V(Laughter)
p173
aa(lp174
VAdults and fellow TEDsters,
p175
aVyou need to listen and learn from kids,
p176
aVand trust us and expect more from us.
p177
aVYou must lend an ear today,
p178
aVbecause we are the leaders of tomorrow, which means
p179
aVwe're going to take care of you when you're old and senile.
p180
aVNo, just kidding.
p181
aa(lp182
V(Laughter)
p183
aa(lp184
VNo, really, we are going to be the next generation,
p185
aVthe ones who will bring this world forward.
p186
aVAnd in case you don't think that this really has meaning for you,
p187
aVremember that cloning is possible,
p188
aVand that involves going through childhood again,
p189
aVin which case you'll want to be heard, just like my generation.
p190
aVNow, the world needs opportunities for new leaders and new ideas.
p191
aVKids need opportunities to lead and succeed.
p192
aVAre you ready to make the match?
p193
aVBecause the world's problems shouldn't be the human family's heirloom.
p194
aa(lp195
VThank you.
p196
aa(lp197
V(Applause)
p198
aa(lp199
VThank you. Thank you.
