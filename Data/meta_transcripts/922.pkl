VSo let me just start with my story.
p4
aVSo I tore my knee joint meniscus cartilage
p5
aVplaying soccer in college.
p6
aVThen I went on to tear my ACL, the ligament in my knee,
p7
aVand then developed an arthritic knee.
p8
aVAnd I'm sure that many of you in this audience have that same story,
p9
aVand, by the way, I married a woman
p10
aVwho has exactly the same story.
p11
aVSo this motivated me to become an orthopedic surgeon
p12
aVand to see if I couldn't focus on solutions for those problems
p13
aVthat would keep me playing sports and not limit me.
p14
aVSo with that, let me just show you a quick video
p15
aVto get you in the mood of what we're trying to explain.
p16
aa(lp17
VNarrator: We are all aware of the risk of cancer,
p18
aVbut there's another disease
p19
aVthat's destined to affect even more of us: arthritis.
p20
aVCancer may kill you, but when you look at the numbers,
p21
aVarthritis ruins more lives.
p22
aVAssuming you live a long life, there's a 50 percent chance
p23
aVyou'll develop arthritis.
p24
aVAnd it's not just aging that causes arthritis.
p25
aVCommon injuries can lead to decades of pain,
p26
aVuntil our joints quite literally grind to a halt.
p27
aVDesperate for a solution, we've turned to engineering
p28
aVto design artificial components
p29
aVto replace our worn-out body parts,
p30
aVbut in the midst of the modern buzz
p31
aVaround the promises of a bionic body,
p32
aVshouldn't we stop and ask if there's a better, more natural way?
p33
aVLet's consider an alternative path.
p34
aVWhat if all the replacements our bodies need
p35
aValready exist in nature,
p36
aVor within our own stem cells?
p37
aVThis is the field of biologic replacements,
p38
aVwhere we replace worn-out parts with new, natural ones.
p39
aa(lp40
VKevin Stone: And so, the mission is:
p41
aVhow do I treat these things biologically?
p42
aVAnd let's talk about both what I did for my wife,
p43
aVand what I've done for hundreds of other patients.
p44
aVFirst thing for my wife,
p45
aVand the most common thing I hear from my patients,
p46
aVparticularly in the 40- to 80-year-old age group, 70-year-old age group,
p47
aVis they come in and say,
p48
aV"Hey, Doc, isn't there just a shock absorber you can put in my knee?
p49
aVI'm not ready for joint replacement."
p50
aVAnd so for her, I put in a human meniscus allograft donor
p51
aVright into that [knee] joint space.
p52
aVAnd [the allograft] replaces [the missing meniscus].
p53
aVAnd then for that unstable ligament,
p54
aVwe put in a human donor ligament
p55
aVto stabilize the knee.
p56
aVAnd then for the damaged arthritis on the surface,
p57
aVwe did a stem cell paste graft,
p58
aVwhich we designed in 1991,
p59
aVto regrow that articular cartilage surface
p60
aVand give it back a smooth surface there.
p61
aVSo here's my wife's bad knee on the left,
p62
aVand her just hiking now
p63
aVfour months later in Aspen, and doing well.
p64
aVAnd it works, not just for my wife, but certainly for other patients.
p65
aVThe girl on the video, Jen Hudak,
p66
aVjust won the Superpipe in Aspen
p67
aVjust nine months after having destroyed her knee,
p68
aVas you see in the other image \u2014
p69
aVand having a paste graft to that knee.
p70
aVAnd so we can regrow these surfaces biologically.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo with all this success,
p73
aVwhy isn't that good enough, you might ask.
p74
aVWell the reason is because there's not enough donor cycles.
p75
aVThere's not enough young, healthy people
p76
aVfalling off their motorcycle
p77
aVand donating that tissue to us.
p78
aVAnd the tissue's very expensive.
p79
aVAnd so that's not going to be a solution
p80
aVthat's going to get us global with biologic tissue.
p81
aVBut the solution is animal tissue
p82
aVbecause it's plentiful, it's cheap,
p83
aVyou can get it from young, healthy tissues,
p84
aVbut the barrier is immunology.
p85
aVAnd the specific barrier
p86
aVis a specific epitope
p87
aVcalled the galactosyl, or gal epitope.
p88
aVSo if we're going to transplant animal tissues to people,
p89
aVwe have to figure out a way to get rid of that epitope.
p90
aa(lp91
VSo my story in working with animal tissues
p92
aVstarts in 1984.
p93
aVAnd I started first
p94
aVwith cow Achilles tendon,
p95
aVwhere we would take the cow Achilles tendon,
p96
aVwhich is type-I collagen,
p97
aVstrip it of its antigens
p98
aVby degrading it with an acid and detergent wash
p99
aVand forming it into a regeneration template.
p100
aVWe would then take that regeneration template
p101
aVand insert it into the missing meniscus cartilage
p102
aVto regrow that in a patient's knee.
p103
aVWe've now done that procedure,
p104
aVand it's been done worldwide in over 4,000 cases,
p105
aVso it's an FDA-approved and worldwide-accepted way
p106
aVto regrow the meniscus.
p107
aVAnd that's great when I can degrade the tissue.
p108
aVBut what happens for your ligament when I need an intact ligament?
p109
aVI can't grind it up in a blender.
p110
aVSo in that case,
p111
aVI have to design \u2014 and we designed with Uri Galili and Tom Turek \u2014
p112
aVan enzyme wash
p113
aVto wash away, or strip,
p114
aVthose galactosyl epitopes
p115
aVwith a specific enzyme.
p116
aVAnd we call that a "gal stripping" technique.
p117
aVWhat we do is humanize the tissue.
p118
aVIt's by gal stripping that tissue
p119
aVwe humanize it (Laughter),
p120
aVand then we can put it back
p121
aVinto a patient's knee.
p122
aVAnd we've done that. Now we've taken pig ligament \u2014
p123
aVyoung, healthy, big tissue,
p124
aVput it into 10 patients in an FDA-approved trial \u2014
p125
aVand then one of our patients went on to have
p126
aVthree Canadian Masters Downhill championships \u2014
p127
aVon his "pig-lig," as he calls it. So we know it can work.
p128
aVAnd there's a wide clinical trial of this tissue now pending.
p129
aa(lp130
VSo what about the next step?
p131
aVWhat about getting to a total biologic knee replacement,
p132
aVnot just the parts?
p133
aVHow are we going to revolutionize artificial joint replacement?
p134
aVWell here's how we're going to do it.
p135
aVSo what we're going to do is take
p136
aVan articular cartilage
p137
aVfrom a young, healthy pig,
p138
aVstrip it of its antigens,
p139
aVload it with your stem cells,
p140
aVthen put it back on to that
p141
aVarthritic surface in your knee,
p142
aVtack it on there, have you heal that surface
p143
aVand then create a new biologic surface for your knee.
p144
aVSo that's our biologic approach right now.
p145
aVWe're going to rebuild your knee with the parts.
p146
aVWe're going to resurface it with a completely new surface.
p147
aa(lp148
VBut we have other advantages from the animal kingdom.
p149
aVThere's a benefit of 400 million years
p150
aVof ambulation.
p151
aVWe can harness those benefits.
p152
aVWe can use thicker, younger, better tissues
p153
aVthan you might have injured in your knee,
p154
aVor that you might have when you're 40, 50 or 60.
p155
aVWe can do it as an outpatient procedure.
p156
aVWe can strip that tissue very economically,
p157
aVand so this is how we can get biologic knee replacement
p158
aVto go global.
p159
aa(lp160
VAnd so welcome to super biologics.
p161
aVIt's not hardware.
p162
aVIt's not software.
p163
aVIt's bioware.
p164
aVIt's version 2.0 of you.
p165
aVAnd so with that, coming to a \u2014
p166
aV(Laughter)
p167
aVcoming to an operating theater near you soon, I believe.
p168
