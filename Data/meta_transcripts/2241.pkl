VI am a plant geneticist.
p4
aVI study genes that make plants resistant to disease
p5
aVand tolerant of stress.
p6
aVIn recent years,
p7
aVmillions of people around the world have come to believe
p8
aVthat there's something sinister about genetic modification.
p9
aVToday, I am going to provide a different perspective.
p10
aa(lp11
VFirst, let me introduce my husband, Raoul.
p12
aVHe's an organic farmer.
p13
aVOn his farm, he plants a variety of different crops.
p14
aVThis is one of the many ecological farming practices
p15
aVhe uses to keep his farm healthy.
p16
aVImagine some of the reactions we get:
p17
aV"Really? An organic farmer and a plant geneticist?
p18
aVCan you agree on anything?"
p19
aa(lp20
VWell, we can, and it's not difficult, because we have the same goal.
p21
aVWe want to help nourish the growing population
p22
aVwithout further destroying the environment.
p23
aVI believe this is the greatest challenge of our time.
p24
aa(lp25
VNow, genetic modification is not new;
p26
aVvirtually everything we eat has been genetically modified
p27
aVin some manner.
p28
aVLet me give you a few examples.
p29
aVOn the left is an image
p30
aVof the ancient ancestor of modern corn.
p31
aVYou see a single roll of grain that's covered in a hard case.
p32
aVUnless you have a hammer,
p33
aVteosinte isn't good for making tortillas.
p34
aVNow, take a look at the ancient ancestor of banana.
p35
aVYou can see the large seeds.
p36
aVAnd unappetizing brussel sprouts,
p37
aVand eggplant, so beautiful.
p38
aa(lp39
VNow, to create these varieties,
p40
aVbreeders have used many different genetic techniques over the years.
p41
aVSome of them are quite creative,
p42
aVlike mixing two different species together
p43
aVusing a process called grafting
p44
aVto create this variety that's half tomato and half potato.
p45
aVBreeders have also used other types of genetic techniques,
p46
aVsuch as random mutagenesis,
p47
aVwhich induces uncharacterized mutations
p48
aVinto the plants.
p49
aVThe rice in the cereal that many of us fed our babies
p50
aVwas developed using this approach.
p51
aa(lp52
VNow, today, breeders have even more options to choose from.
p53
aVSome of them are extraordinarily precise.
p54
aa(lp55
VI want to give you a couple examples from my own work.
p56
aVI work on rice, which is a staple food for more than half the world's people.
p57
aVEach year, 40 percent of the potential harvest
p58
aVis lost to pest and disease.
p59
aVFor this reason, farmers plant rice varieties
p60
aVthat carry genes for resistance.
p61
aVThis approach has been used for nearly 100 years.
p62
aVYet, when I started graduate school,
p63
aVno one knew what these genes were.
p64
aVIt wasn't until the 1990s that scientists finally uncovered
p65
aVthe genetic basis of resistance.
p66
aVIn my laboratory, we isolated a gene for immunity to a very serious
p67
aVbacterial disease in Asia and Africa.
p68
aVWe found we could engineer the gene into a conventional rice variety
p69
aVthat's normally susceptible,
p70
aVand you can see the two leaves on the bottom here
p71
aVare highly resistant to infection.
p72
aa(lp73
VNow, the same month that my laboratory published
p74
aVour discovery on the rice immunity gene,
p75
aVmy friend and colleague Dave Mackill stopped by my office.
p76
aVHe said, "Seventy million rice farmers are having trouble growing rice."
p77
aVThat's because their fields are flooded,
p78
aVand these rice farmers are living on less than two dollars a day.
p79
aVAlthough rice grows well in standing water,
p80
aVmost rice varieties will die if they're submerged
p81
aVfor more than three days.
p82
aVFlooding is expected to be increasingly problematic
p83
aVas the climate changes.
p84
aVHe told me that his graduate student Kenong Xu and himself
p85
aVwere studying an ancient variety of rice that had an amazing property.
p86
aVIt could withstand two weeks of complete submergence.
p87
aVHe asked if I would be willing to help them isolate this gene.
p88
aVI said yes \u2014 I was very excited, because I knew if we were successful,
p89
aVwe could potentially help millions of farmers grow rice
p90
aVeven when their fields were flooded.
p91
aa(lp92
VKenong spent 10 years looking for this gene.
p93
aVThen one day, he said,
p94
aV"Come look at this experiment. You've got to see it."
p95
aVI went to the greenhouse and I saw
p96
aVthat the conventional variety that was flooded for 18 days had died,
p97
aVbut the rice variety that we had genetically engineered
p98
aVwith a new gene we had discovered, called Sub1, was alive.
p99
aVKenong and I were amazed and excited
p100
aVthat a single gene could have this dramatic effect.
p101
aVBut this is just a greenhouse experiment.
p102
aVWould this work in the field?
p103
aa(lp104
VNow, I'm going to show you a four-month time lapse video
p105
aVtaken at the International Rice Research Institute.
p106
aVBreeders there developed a rice variety carrying the Sub1 gene
p107
aVusing another genetic technique called precision breeding.
p108
aVOn the left, you can see the Sub1 variety,
p109
aVand on the right is the conventional variety.
p110
aVBoth varieties do very well at first,
p111
aVbut then the field is flooded for 17 days.
p112
aVYou can see the Sub1 variety does great.
p113
aVIn fact, it produces three and a half times more grain
p114
aVthan the conventional variety.
p115
aVI love this video
p116
aVbecause it shows the power of plant genetics to help farmers.
p117
aVLast year, with the help of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,
p118
aVthree and a half million farmers grew Sub1 rice.
p119
aa(lp120
V(Applause)
p121
aa(lp122
VThank you.
p123
aa(lp124
VNow, many people don't mind genetic modification
p125
aVwhen it comes to moving rice genes around,
p126
aVrice genes in rice plants,
p127
aVor even when it comes to mixing species together
p128
aVthrough grafting or random mutagenesis.
p129
aVBut when it comes to taking genes from viruses and bacteria
p130
aVand putting them into plants,
p131
aVa lot of people say, "Yuck."
p132
aVWhy would you do that?
p133
aVThe reason is that sometimes it's the cheapest, safest,
p134
aVand most effective technology
p135
aVfor enhancing food security and advancing sustainable agriculture.
p136
aVI'm going to give you three examples.
p137
aa(lp138
VFirst, take a look at papaya. It's delicious, right?
p139
aVBut now, look at this papaya.
p140
aVThis papaya is infected with papaya ringspot virus.
p141
aVIn the 1950s, this virus nearly wiped out the entire production
p142
aVof papaya on the island of Oahu in Hawaii.
p143
aVMany people thought that the Hawaiian papaya was doomed,
p144
aVbut then, a local Hawaiian,
p145
aVa plant pathologist named Dennis Gonsalves,
p146
aVdecided to try to fight this disease using genetic engineering.
p147
aVHe took a snippet of viral DNA and he inserted it
p148
aVinto the papaya genome.
p149
aVThis is kind of like a human getting a vaccination.
p150
aVNow, take a look at his field trial.
p151
aVYou can see the genetically engineered papaya in the center.
p152
aVIt's immune to infection.
p153
aVThe conventional papaya around the outside is severely infected with the virus.
p154
aVDennis' pioneering work is credited with rescuing the papaya industry.
p155
aVToday, 20 years later, there's still no other method to control this disease.
p156
aVThere's no organic method. There's no conventional method.
p157
aVEighty percent of Hawaiian papaya is genetically engineered.
p158
aa(lp159
VNow, some of you may still feel a little queasy about viral genes in your food,
p160
aVbut consider this:
p161
aVThe genetically engineered papaya carries just a trace amount of the virus.
p162
aVIf you bite into an organic or conventional papaya
p163
aVthat is infected with the virus,
p164
aVyou will be chewing on tenfold more viral protein.
p165
aa(lp166
VNow, take a look at this pest feasting on an eggplant.
p167
aVThe brown you see is frass,
p168
aVwhat comes out the back end of the insect.
p169
aVTo control this serious pest,
p170
aVwhich can devastate the entire eggplant crop in Bangladesh,
p171
aVBangladeshi farmers spray insecticides
p172
aVtwo to three times a week,
p173
aVsometimes twice a day, when pest pressure is high.
p174
aVBut we know that some insecticides are very harmful to human health,
p175
aVespecially when farmers and their families
p176
aVcannot afford proper protection, like these children.
p177
aVIn less developed countries, it's estimated that 300,000 people
p178
aVdie every year because of insecticide misuse and exposure.
p179
aVCornell and Bangladeshi scientists decided to fight this disease
p180
aVusing a genetic technique that builds on an organic farming approach.
p181
aVOrganic farmers like my husband Raoul spray an insecticide called B.T.,
p182
aVwhich is based on a bacteria.
p183
aVThis pesticide is very specific to caterpillar pests,
p184
aVand in fact, it's nontoxic to humans, fish and birds.
p185
aVIt's less toxic than table salt.
p186
aVBut this approach does not work well in Bangladesh.
p187
aVThat's because these insecticide sprays
p188
aVare difficult to find, they're expensive,
p189
aVand they don't prevent the insect from getting inside the plants.
p190
aVIn the genetic approach, scientists cut the gene out of the bacteria
p191
aVand insert it directly into the eggplant genome.
p192
aVWill this work to reduce insecticide sprays in Bangladesh?
p193
aVDefinitely.
p194
aVLast season, farmers reported they were able to reduce their insecticide use
p195
aVby a huge amount, almost down to zero.
p196
aVThey're able to harvest and replant for the next season.
p197
aa(lp198
VNow, I've given you a couple examples of how genetic engineering can be used
p199
aVto fight pests and disease
p200
aVand to reduce the amount of insecticides.
p201
aVMy final example is an example
p202
aVwhere genetic engineering can be used to reduce malnutrition.
p203
aVIn less developed countries,
p204
aV500,000 children go blind every year because of lack of Vitamin A.
p205
aVMore than half will die.
p206
aVFor this reason, scientists supported by the Rockefeller Foundation
p207
aVgenetically engineered a golden rice
p208
aVto produce beta-carotene, which is the precursor of Vitamin A.
p209
aVThis is the same pigment that we find in carrots.
p210
aVResearchers estimate that just one cup of golden rice per day
p211
aVwill save the lives of thousands of children.
p212
aVBut golden rice is virulently opposed
p213
aVby activists who are against genetic modification.
p214
aVJust last year,
p215
aVactivists invaded and destroyed a field trial in the Philippines.
p216
aVWhen I heard about the destruction,
p217
aVI wondered if they knew that they were destroying much more
p218
aVthan a scientific research project,
p219
aVthat they were destroying medicines that children desperately needed
p220
aVto save their sight and their lives.
p221
aa(lp222
VSome of my friends and family still worry:
p223
aVHow do you know genes in the food are safe to eat?
p224
aVI explained the genetic engineering,
p225
aVthe process of moving genes between species,
p226
aVhas been used for more than 40 years
p227
aVin wines, in medicine, in plants, in cheeses.
p228
aVIn all that time, there hasn't been a single case of harm
p229
aVto human health or the environment.
p230
aVBut I say, look, I'm not asking you to believe me.
p231
aVScience is not a belief system.
p232
aVMy opinion doesn't matter.
p233
aVLet's look at the evidence.
p234
aVAfter 20 years of careful study and rigorous peer review
p235
aVby thousands of independent scientists,
p236
aVevery major scientific organization in the world has concluded
p237
aVthat the crops currently on the market are safe to eat
p238
aVand that the process of genetic engineering
p239
aVis no more risky than older methods of genetic modification.
p240
aVThese are precisely the same organizations that most of us trust
p241
aVwhen it comes to other important scientific issues
p242
aVsuch as global climate change or the safety of vaccines.
p243
aa(lp244
VRaoul and I believe that, instead of worrying about the genes in our food,
p245
aVwe must focus on how we can help children grow up healthy.
p246
aVWe must ask if farmers in rural communities can thrive,
p247
aVand if everyone can afford the food.
p248
aVWe must try to minimize environmental degradation.
p249
aVWhat scares me most about the loud arguments and misinformation
p250
aVabout plant genetics
p251
aVis that the poorest people who most need the technology
p252
aVmay be denied access because of the vague fears and prejudices
p253
aVof those who have enough to eat.
p254
aa(lp255
VWe have a huge challenge in front of us.
p256
aVLet's celebrate scientific innovation and use it.
p257
aVIt's our responsibility
p258
aVto do everything we can to help alleviate human suffering
p259
aVand safeguard the environment.
p260
aa(lp261
VThank you.
p262
aa(lp263
V(Applause)
p264
aa(lp265
VThank you.
p266
aa(lp267
VChris Anderson: Powerfully argued.
p268
aVThe people who argue against GMOs,
p269
aVas I understand it, the core piece comes from two things.
p270
aVOne, complexity and unintended consequence.
p271
aVNature is this incredibly complex machine.
p272
aVIf we put out these brand new genes that we've created,
p273
aVthat haven't been challenged by years of evolution,
p274
aVand they started mixing up with the rest of what's going on,
p275
aVcouldn't that trigger some kind of cataclysm or problem,
p276
aVespecially when you add in the commercial incentive
p277
aVthat some companies have to put them out there?
p278
aVThe fear is that those incentives
p279
aVmean that the decision is not made on purely scientific grounds,
p280
aVand even if it was, that there would be unintended consequences.
p281
aVHow do we know that there isn't a big risk of some unintended consequence?
p282
aVOften our tinkerings with nature do lead to big, unintended consequences
p283
aVand chain reactions.
p284
aa(lp285
VPamela Ronald: Okay, so on the commercial aspects,
p286
aVone thing that's really important to understand is that,
p287
aVin the developed world, farmers in the United States,
p288
aValmost all farmers, whether they're organic or conventional,
p289
aVthey buy seed produced by seed companies.
p290
aVSo there's definitely a commercial interest to sell a lot of seed,
p291
aVbut hopefully they're selling seed that the farmers want to buy.
p292
aVIt's different in the less developed world.
p293
aVFarmers there cannot afford the seed.
p294
aVThese seeds are not being sold.
p295
aVThese seeds are being distributed freely
p296
aVthrough traditional kinds of certification groups,
p297
aVso it is very important in less developed countries
p298
aVthat the seed be freely available.
p299
aa(lp300
VCA: Wouldn't some activists say that this is actually part of the conspiracy?
p301
aVThis is the heroin strategy.
p302
aVYou seed the stuff, and people have no choice
p303
aVbut to be hooked on these seeds forever?
p304
aa(lp305
VPR: There are a lot of conspiracy theories for sure, but it doesn't work that way.
p306
aVFor example, the seed that's being distributed, the flood-tolerant rice,
p307
aVthis is distributed freely
p308
aVthrough Indian and Bangladeshi seed certification agencies,
p309
aVso there's no commercial interest at all.
p310
aVThe golden rice was developed through support of the Rockefeller Foundation.
p311
aVAgain, it's being freely distributed.
p312
aVThere are no commercial profits
p313
aVin this situation.
p314
aVAnd now to address your other question about, well, mixing genes,
p315
aVaren't there some unintended consequences?
p316
aVAbsolutely \u2014 every time we do something different,
p317
aVthere's an unintended consequence,
p318
aVbut one of the points I was trying to make
p319
aVis that we've been doing kind of crazy things to our plants,
p320
aVmutagenesis using radiation or chemical mutagenesis.
p321
aVThis induces thousands of uncharacterized mutations,
p322
aVand this is even a higher risk of unintended consequence
p323
aVthan many of the modern methods.
p324
aVAnd so it's really important not to use the term GMO
p325
aVbecause it's scientifically meaningless.
p326
aVI feel it's very important to talk about a specific crop
p327
aVand a specific product, and think about the needs of the consumer.
p328
aa(lp329
VCA: So part of what's happening here is that there's a mental model
p330
aVin a lot of people that nature is nature, and it's pure and pristine,
p331
aVand to tinker with it is Frankensteinian.
p332
aVIt's making something that's pure dangerous in some way,
p333
aVand I think you're saying that that whole model
p334
aVjust misunderstands how nature is.
p335
aVNature is a much more chaotic interplay of genetic changes
p336
aVthat have been happening all the time anyway.
p337
aa(lp338
VPR: That's absolutely true, and there's no such thing as pure food.
p339
aVI mean, you could not spray eggplant with insecticides
p340
aVor not genetically engineer it, but then you'd be stuck eating frass.
p341
aVSo there's no purity there.
p342
aa(lp343
VCA: Pam Ronald, thank you.  That was powerfully argued.
p344
aVPR: Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
