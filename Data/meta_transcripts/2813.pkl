(lp3
VI'm a journalist,
p4
aVand I'm an immigrant.
p5
aVAnd these two conditions define me.
p6
aa(lp7
VI was born in Mexico,
p8
aVbut I've spent more than half my life reporting in the United States,
p9
aVa country which was itself created by immigrants.
p10
aVAs a reporter
p11
aVand as a foreigner,
p12
aVI've learned that neutrality,
p13
aVsilence
p14
aVand fear aren't the best options \u2014
p15
aVnot in journalism, nor in life.
p16
aVNeutrality
p17
aVis often an excuse that we journalists use
p18
aVto hide from our true responsibility.
p19
aVWhat is that responsibility?
p20
aVIt is to question
p21
aVand to challenge
p22
aVthose in positions of power.
p23
aVThat's what journalism is for.
p24
aa(lp25
VThat's the beauty of journalism:
p26
aVto question and challenge the powerful.
p27
aVOf course, we have the obligation to report reality as it is,
p28
aVnot how we would like it to be.
p29
aVIn that sense, I agree with the principle of objectivity:
p30
aVif a house is blue, I say that it's blue.
p31
aVIf there are a million unemployed people, I say there are a million.
p32
aVBut neutrality
p33
aVwon't necessarily lead me to the truth.
p34
aVEven if I'm unequivocally scrupulous,
p35
aVand I present both sides of a news item \u2014
p36
aVthe Democratic and the Republican,
p37
aVthe liberal and the conservative,
p38
aVthe government's and the opposition's \u2014
p39
aVin the end, I have no guarantee,
p40
aVnor are any of us guaranteed that we'll know what's true
p41
aVand what's not true.
p42
aVLife is much more complicated,
p43
aVand I believe journalism should reflect that very complexity.
p44
aa(lp45
VTo be clear: I refuse
p46
aVto be a tape recorder.
p47
aVI didn't become a journalist to be a tape recorder.
p48
aVI know what you're going to say: no one uses tape recorders nowadays.
p49
aa(lp50
V(Laughter)
p51
aa(lp52
VIn that case, I refuse to take out my cell phone
p53
aVand hit the record button
p54
aVand point it in front of me as if I were at a concert,
p55
aVlike a fan at a concert.
p56
aVThat is not true journalism.
p57
aVContrary to what many people think,
p58
aVjournalists are making value judgments all the time,
p59
aVethical and moral judgments.
p60
aVAnd we're always making decisions that are exceedingly personal
p61
aVand extraordinarily subjective.
p62
aa(lp63
VFor example:
p64
aVWhat happens if you're called to cover a dictatorship,
p65
aVlike Augusto Pinochet's regime in Chile
p66
aVor Fidel Castro's in Cuba?
p67
aVAre you going to report only what the general and commander want,
p68
aVor will you confront them?
p69
aVWhat happens if you find out that in your country
p70
aVor in the country next door,
p71
aVstudents are disappearing
p72
aVand hidden graves are appearing,
p73
aVor that millions of dollars are disappearing from the budget
p74
aVand that ex-presidents are magically now multimillionaires?
p75
aVWill you report only the official version?
p76
aVOr what happens
p77
aVif you're assigned to cover
p78
aVthe presidential elections of the primary superpower,
p79
aVand one of the candidates makes comments that are racist,
p80
aVsexist
p81
aVand xenophobic?
p82
aVThat happened to me.
p83
aVAnd I want to tell you what I did,
p84
aVbut first, let me explain where I'm coming from,
p85
aVso you can understand my reaction.
p86
aa(lp87
VI grew up in Mexico City, the oldest of five brothers,
p88
aVand our family simply couldn't afford to pay for all of our college tuition.
p89
aVSo I studied in the morning, and worked in the afternoon.
p90
aVEventually,
p91
aVI got the job I had always wanted:
p92
aVtelevision reporter.
p93
aVIt was a big opportunity.
p94
aVBut as I was working on my third story, I ended up
p95
aVcriticizing the president,
p96
aVand questioning the lack of democracy in Mexico.
p97
aVIn Mexico, from 1929 to 2000, elections were always rigged;
p98
aVthe incumbent president would hand-pick his successor.
p99
aVThat's not true democracy.
p100
aVTo me it seemed like a brilliant idea to expose the president,
p101
aVbut to my boss \u2014
p102
aa(lp103
V(Laughter)
p104
aa(lp105
VMy boss didn't think it was such a great idea.
p106
aVAt that time, the presidential office, Los Pinos, had issued a direct censor
p107
aVagainst the media.
p108
aVMy boss, who, aside from being in charge of the show I worked for,
p109
aVwas also in charge of a soccer team.
p110
aVI always suspected that he was more interested in goals
p111
aVthan in the news.
p112
aVHe censored my report.
p113
aVHe asked me to change it, I said no,
p114
aVso he put another journalist on the story
p115
aVto write what I was supposed to say.
p116
aVI did not want to be a censored journalist.
p117
aVI don't know where I found the strength,
p118
aVbut I wrote my letter of resignation.
p119
aVAnd so at 24 years of age \u2014 just 24 \u2014
p120
aVI made the most difficult and most transcendental decision of my life.
p121
aVNot only did I resign from television,
p122
aVbut I had also decided to leave my country.
p123
aa(lp124
VI sold my car, a beat-up little red Volkswagen,
p125
aVcame up with some money
p126
aVand said goodbye to my family,
p127
aVto my friends,
p128
aVto my streets,
p129
aVto my favorite haunts \u2014 to my tacos \u2014
p130
aa(lp131
V(Laughter)
p132
aa(lp133
Vand I bought a one-way ticket
p134
aVto Los Angeles, California.
p135
aVAnd so I became
p136
aVone of the 250 million immigrants that exist in the world.
p137
aa(lp138
VAsk any immigrant
p139
aVabout the first day they arrived in their new country,
p140
aVand you'll find that they remember absolutely everything,
p141
aVlike it was a movie with background music.
p142
aVIn my case, I arrived in Los Angeles, the sun was setting,
p143
aVand everything I owned \u2014
p144
aVa guitar, a suitcase and some documents \u2014
p145
aVI could carry all of it
p146
aVwith my two hands.
p147
aVThat feeling of absolute freedom,
p148
aVI haven't experienced since.
p149
aVAnd I survived with what little I had.
p150
aVI obtained a student visa; I was studying.
p151
aVI ate a lot of lettuce and bread, because that's all I had.
p152
aVFinally, in 1984,
p153
aVI landed my first job as a TV reporter in the United States.
p154
aa(lp155
VAnd the first thing I noticed was that in the US,
p156
aVmy colleagues criticized \u2014 and mercilessly \u2014
p157
aVthen president Ronald Reagan,
p158
aVand absolutely nothing happened; no one censored them.
p159
aVAnd I thought:
p160
aVI love this country.
p161
aa(lp162
V(Laughter)
p163
aa(lp164
V(Applause)
p165
aa(lp166
VAnd that's how it's been
p167
aVfor more than 30 years:
p168
aVreporting with total freedom,
p169
aVand being treated as an equal despite being an immigrant \u2014
p170
aVuntil, without warning,
p171
aVI was assigned to cover the recent US presidential election.
p172
aa(lp173
VOn June 16, 2015,
p174
aVa candidate who would eventually become the president of the United States
p175
aVsaid that Mexican immigrants
p176
aVwere criminals,
p177
aVdrug traffickers
p178
aVand rapists.
p179
aVAnd I knew
p180
aVthat he was lying.
p181
aVI knew he was wrong for one very simple reason:
p182
aVI'm a Mexican immigrant.
p183
aVAnd we're not like that.
p184
aVSo I did what any other reporter would have done:
p185
aVI wrote him a letter by hand
p186
aVrequesting an interview,
p187
aVand I sent it to his Tower in New York.
p188
aa(lp189
VThe next day
p190
aVI was at work,
p191
aVand I suddenly began to receive hundreds of calls and texts
p192
aVon my cell phone,
p193
aVsome more insulting than others.
p194
aVI didn't know what was happening until my friend came into my office
p195
aVand said, "They published your cell number online."
p196
aVThey actually did that.
p197
aVHere's the letter they sent
p198
aVwhere they gave out my number.
p199
aVDon't bother writing it down, OK? I already changed it.
p200
aa(lp201
V(Laughter)
p202
aa(lp203
VBut I learned two things.
p204
aVThe first one is that you should never, never, ever
p205
aVgive your cell number to Donald Trump.
p206
aa(lp207
V(Laughter)
p208
aa(lp209
V(Applause)
p210
aa(lp211
VThe second lesson was that I needed to stop being neutral
p212
aVat that point.
p213
aVFrom then on, my mission as a journalist changed.
p214
aVI would confront the candidate
p215
aVand show that he was wrong,
p216
aVthat what he said about immigrants in the US was not true.
p217
aa(lp218
VLet me give you some figures.
p219
aVNinety-seven percent of all undocumented people in the United States
p220
aVare good people.
p221
aVLess than three percent have committed a serious crime,
p222
aVor "felony," as they say in English.
p223
aVIn comparison, six percent of US citizens have committed a serious crime.
p224
aVThe conclusion is that undocumented immigrants behave much better
p225
aVthan US citizens.
p226
aa(lp227
VBased on that data, I made a plan.
p228
aVEight weeks after they published my cell number,
p229
aVI obtained a press pass for a press conference
p230
aVfor the candidate gaining momentum in the polls.
p231
aVI decided to confront him
p232
aVin person.
p233
aVBut ...
p234
aVthings didn't turn out exactly as I had planned; watch:
p235
aa(lp236
V[Donald Trump Press Conference Dubuque, Iowa]
p237
aa(lp238
V(Video) Jorge Ramos: Mr. Trump, I have a question about immigration.
p239
aa(lp240
VDonald Trump: Who's next? Yes, please.
p241
aa(lp242
VJR: Your immigration plan is full of empty promises.
p243
aa(lp244
VDT: Excuse me, you weren't called. Sit down. Sit down!
p245
aa(lp246
VJR: I'm a reporter; as an immigrant and as a US citizen,
p247
aVI have the right to ask a question.
p248
aa(lp249
VDT: No you don't. JR: I have the right to ask \u2014
p250
aa(lp251
VDT: Go back to Univision.
p252
aa(lp253
VJR: This is the question:
p254
aVYou cannot deport 11 million people.
p255
aVYou cannot build a 1900-mile wall.
p256
aVYou cannot deny citizenship to children in this country.
p257
aa(lp258
VDT: Sit down. JR: And with those ideas \u2014
p259
aa(lp260
VDT: You weren't called.
p261
aa(lp262
VJR: I'm a reporter and I have \u2014 Don't touch me, sir.
p263
aa(lp264
VGuard 1: Please don't disrupt. You're being disruptive.
p265
aa(lp266
VJR: I have the right to ask a question. G1: Yes, in order. In turn, sir.
p267
aa(lp268
VGuard 2: Do you have your media credential?
p269
aa(lp270
VJR: I have the right \u2014
p271
aa(lp272
VG2: Where? Let me see. JR: It's over there.
p273
aa(lp274
VMan: Whoever's coming out, stay out.
p275
aa(lp276
VG2: You've just got to wait your turn.
p277
aa(lp278
VMan: You're very rude. It's not about you.
p279
aa(lp280
VJR: It's not about you \u2014 Man: Get out of my country!
p281
aa(lp282
VMan: It's not about you.
p283
aa(lp284
VJR: I'm a US citizen, too.
p285
aa(lp286
VMan: Well ...whatever. No, Univision. It's not about you.
p287
aa(lp288
VJR: It's not about you. It's about the United States.
p289
aa(lp290
V(Applause)
p291
aa(lp292
V(Applause ends)
p293
aa(lp294
VWhenever I see that video,
p295
aVthe first thing I always think is that hate
p296
aVis contagious.
p297
aVIf you notice, after the candidate says, "Go back to Univision" \u2014 that's code;
p298
aVwhat he's telling me is, "Get out of here."
p299
aVOne member of his entourage, as if he had been given permission, said,
p300
aV"Get out of my country,"
p301
aVnot knowing that I'm also a US citizen.
p302
aa(lp303
VAfter watching this video many times,
p304
aVI also think that in order to break free from neutrality \u2014
p305
aVand for it to be a true break \u2014
p306
aVone has to lose their fear,
p307
aVand then learn how to say, "No;
p308
aVI'm not going to be quiet.
p309
aVI'm not going to sit down.
p310
aVAnd I'm not going to leave."
p311
aVThe word "no" \u2014
p312
aa(lp313
V(Applause)
p314
aa(lp315
V"no" is the most powerful word that exists in any language,
p316
aVand it always precedes any important change in our lives.
p317
aVAnd I think there's enormous dignity
p318
aVand it generates a great deal of respect
p319
aVto be able to step back
p320
aVand to push back and say,
p321
aV"No."
p322
aa(lp323
VElie Wiesel \u2014 Holocaust survivor,
p324
aVNobel Peace Prize recipient
p325
aVand who, unfortunately, we lost very recently \u2014
p326
aVsaid some very wise words:
p327
aV"We must take a side.
p328
aVNeutrality helps only the oppressor,
p329
aVnever the victim."
p330
aVAnd he's completely right.
p331
aVWe journalists are obligated to take sides in certain circumstances;
p332
aVin cases of racism,
p333
aVdiscrimination,
p334
aVcorruption,
p335
aVlying to the public,
p336
aVdictatorships and human rights,
p337
aVwe need to set aside neutrality and indifference.
p338
aa(lp339
VSpanish has a great word
p340
aVto describe the stance that journalists should take.
p341
aVThe word is  "contrapoder [anti-establishment]."
p342
aVBasically, we journalists should be on the opposite side
p343
aVfrom those in power.
p344
aVBut if you're in bed with politicians,
p345
aVif you go to the baptism or wedding of the governor's son
p346
aVor if you want to be the president's buddy,
p347
aVhow are you going to criticize them?
p348
aVWhen I'm assigned to interview a powerful or influential person,
p349
aVI always keep two things in mind:
p350
aVif I don't ask this difficult and uncomfortable question,
p351
aVno one else is going to;
p352
aVand that I'm never going to see this person again.
p353
aVSo I'm not looking to make a good impression
p354
aVor to forge a connection.
p355
aVIn the end, if I have to choose between being the president's friend
p356
aVor enemy,
p357
aVI always prefer to be their enemy.
p358
aa(lp359
VIn closing:
p360
aVI know this is a difficult time to be an immigrant and a journalist,
p361
aVbut now more than ever,
p362
aVwe need journalists who are prepared,
p363
aVat any given moment,
p364
aVto set neutrality aside.
p365
aVPersonally, I feel like I've been preparing for this moment
p366
aVmy whole life.
p367
aVWhen they censored me when I was 24,
p368
aVI learned that neutrality, fear and silence often make you an accomplice
p369
aVin crime, abuse
p370
aVand injustice.
p371
aVAnd being an accomplice to power
p372
aVis never good journalism.
p373
aa(lp374
VNow, at 59 years old,
p375
aVI only hope to have a tiny bit
p376
aVof the courage and mental clarity I had at 24,
p377
aVand that way, never again
p378
aVremain quiet.
p379
aVThank you very much.
p380
aa(lp381
