VIn my industry,
p4
aVwe believe that images can change the world.
p5
aVOkay, we're naive, we're bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.
p6
aVThe truth is that we know that the
p7
aVimages themselves don't change the world,
p8
aVbut we're also aware that, since the beginning of photography,
p9
aVimages have provoked reactions in people,
p10
aVand those reactions have caused change to happen.
p11
aa(lp12
VSo let's begin with a group of images.
p13
aVI'd be extremely surprised
p14
aVif you didn't recognize many or most of them.
p15
aVThey're best described as iconic:
p16
aVso iconic, perhaps, they're cliches.
p17
aVIn fact, they're so well-known
p18
aVthat you might even recognize them
p19
aVin a slightly or somewhat different form.
p20
aa(lp21
V(Laughter)
p22
aa(lp23
VBut I think we're looking for something more.
p24
aVWe're looking for something more.
p25
aVWe're looking for images that shine
p26
aVan uncompromising light on crucial issues,
p27
aVimages that transcend borders, that transcend religions,
p28
aVimages that provoke us
p29
aVto step up and do something \u2014
p30
aVin other words, to act.
p31
aVWell, this image you've all seen.
p32
aVIt changed our view of the physical world.
p33
aVWe had never seen our planet from this perspective before.
p34
aVMany people credit
p35
aVa lot of the birth of the environmental movement
p36
aVto our seeing the planet like this
p37
aVfor the first time \u2014
p38
aVits smallness, its fragility.
p39
aa(lp40
VForty years later, this group, more than most,
p41
aVare well aware of the destructive power
p42
aVthat our species can wield over our environment.
p43
aVAnd at last, we appear to be doing something about it.
p44
aVThis destructive power takes many different forms.
p45
aVFor example, these images taken by Brent Stirton
p46
aVin the Congo.
p47
aVThese gorillas were murdered, some would even say crucified,
p48
aVand unsurprisingly,
p49
aVthey sparked international outrage.
p50
aVMost recently,
p51
aVwe've been tragically reminded of the destructive power of nature itself
p52
aVwith the recent earthquake in Haiti.
p53
aa(lp54
VWell, I think what is far worse
p55
aVis man's destructive power over man.
p56
aVSamuel Pisar, an Auschwitz survivor, said,
p57
aVand I'll quote him,
p58
aV"The Holocaust teaches us that nature,
p59
aVeven in its cruelest moments,
p60
aVis benign in comparison with man,
p61
aVwhen he loses his moral compass and his reason."
p62
aa(lp63
VThere's another kind of crucifixion.
p64
aVThe horrifying images from Abu Ghraib
p65
aVas well as the images from Guantanamo
p66
aVhad a profound impact.
p67
aVThe publication of those images,
p68
aVas opposed to the images themselves,
p69
aVcaused a government to change its policies.
p70
aVSome would argue that it is those images
p71
aVthat did more to fuel the insurgency in Iraq
p72
aVthan virtually any other single act.
p73
aVFurthermore, those images forever removed
p74
aVthe so-called moral high ground of the occupying forces.
p75
aa(lp76
VLet's go back a little.
p77
aVIn the 1960s and 1970s,
p78
aVthe Vietnam War was basically shown
p79
aVin America's living rooms day in, day out.
p80
aVNews photos brought people face to face
p81
aVwith the victims of the war: a little girl burned by napalm,
p82
aVa student killed by the National Guard
p83
aVat Kent State University in Ohio during a protest.
p84
aVIn fact, these images became
p85
aVthe voices of protest themselves.
p86
aa(lp87
VNow, images have power
p88
aVto shed light of understanding
p89
aVon suspicion, ignorance,
p90
aVand in particular \u2014 I've given a lot of talks on this
p91
aVbut I'll just show one image \u2014
p92
aVthe issue of HIV/AIDS.
p93
aVIn the 1980s, the stigmatization of people with the disease
p94
aVwas an enormous barrier
p95
aVto even discussing or addressing it.
p96
aVA simple act, in 1987, of the most famous woman in the world,
p97
aVthe Princess of Wales, touching
p98
aVan HIV/AIDS infected baby
p99
aVdid a great deal, especially in Europe, to stop that.
p100
aVShe, better than most, knew the power of an image.
p101
aa(lp102
VSo when we are confronted by a powerful image,
p103
aVwe all have a choice:
p104
aVWe can look away, or we can address the image.
p105
aVThankfully, when these photos appeared in
p106
aVThe Guardian in 1998,
p107
aVthey put a lot of focus and attention and, in the end, a lot of money
p108
aVtowards the Sudan famine relief efforts.
p109
aVDid the images change the world?
p110
aVNo, but they had a major impact.
p111
aVImages often push us to question our core beliefs
p112
aVand our responsibilities to each other.
p113
aVWe all saw those images after Katrina,
p114
aVand I think for millions of people
p115
aVthey had a very strong impact.
p116
aVAnd I think it's very unlikely
p117
aVthat they were far from the minds of Americans
p118
aVwhen they went to vote in November 2008.
p119
aa(lp120
VUnfortunately, some very important images
p121
aVare deemed too graphic or disturbing for us to see them.
p122
aVI'll show you one photo here,
p123
aVand it's a photo by Eugene Richards of an Iraq War veteran
p124
aVfrom an extraordinary piece of work,
p125
aVwhich has never been published, called War Is Personal.
p126
aVBut images don't need to be graphic
p127
aVin order to remind us of the tragedy of war.
p128
aVJohn Moore set up this photo at Arlington Cemetery.
p129
aVAfter all the tense moments of conflict
p130
aVin all the conflict zones of the world,
p131
aVthere's one photograph from a much quieter place
p132
aVthat haunts me still, much more than the others.
p133
aa(lp134
VAnsel Adams said, and I'm going to disagree with him,
p135
aV"You don't take a photograph, you make it."
p136
aVIn my view, it's not the photographer who makes the photo,
p137
aVit's you.
p138
aVWe bring to each image
p139
aVour own values, our own belief systems,
p140
aVand as a result of that, the image resonates with us.
p141
aVMy company has 70 million images.
p142
aVI have one image in my office.
p143
aVHere it is.
p144
aVI hope that the next time you see
p145
aVan image that sparks something in you,
p146
aVyou'll better understand why,
p147
aVand I know that speaking to this audience,
p148
aVyou'll definitely do something about it.
p149
aa(lp150
VAnd thank you to all the photographers.
