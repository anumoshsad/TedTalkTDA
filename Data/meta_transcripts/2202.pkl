VAs a software developer and technologist,
p4
aVI've worked on a number of civic technology projects
p5
aVover the years.
p6
aVCivic tech is sometimes referred to as tech for good,
p7
aVusing technology to solve humanitarian problems.
p8
aa(lp9
VThis is in 2010 in Uganda,
p10
aVworking on a solution that allowed local populations
p11
aVto avoid government surveillance on their mobile phones
p12
aVfor expressing dissent.
p13
aVThat same technology was deployed later in North Africa
p14
aVfor similar purposes to help activists stay connected
p15
aVwhen governments were deliberately shutting off connectivity
p16
aVas a means of population control.
p17
aa(lp18
VBut over the years, as I have thought about these technologies
p19
aVand the things that I work on,
p20
aVa question kind of nags in the back of my mind, which is,
p21
aVwhat if we're wrong about the virtues of technology,
p22
aVand if it sometimes actively hurts
p23
aVthe communities that we're intending to help?
p24
aVThe tech industry around the world tends to operate under similar assumptions
p25
aVthat if we build great things,
p26
aVit will positively affect everyone.
p27
aVEventually, these innovations will get out and find everyone.
p28
aVBut that's not always the case.
p29
aVI like to call this blind championing of technology "trickle-down techonomics,"
p30
aVto borrow a phrase. (Laughter)
p31
aVWe tend to think that if we design things for the select few,
p32
aVeventually those technologies will reach everyone,
p33
aVand that's not always the case.
p34
aVTechnology and innovation behaves a lot like wealth and capital.
p35
aVThey tend to consolidate in the hands of the few,
p36
aVand sometimes they find their way out into the hands of the many.
p37
aa(lp38
VAnd so most of you aren't tackling oppressive regimes on the weekends,
p39
aVso I wanted to think of a few examples that might be a little bit more relatable.
p40
aa(lp41
VIn the world of wearables and smartphones and apps,
p42
aVthere's a big movement to track people's personal health
p43
aVwith applications that track the number of calories that you burn
p44
aVor whether you're sitting too much or walking enough.
p45
aVThese technologies make patient intake in medical facilities much more efficient,
p46
aVand in turn, these medical facilities
p47
aVare starting to expect these types of efficiencies.
p48
aVAs these digital tools find their way into medical rooms,
p49
aVand they become digitally ready,
p50
aVwhat happens to the digitally invisible?
p51
aVWhat does the medical experience look like
p52
aVfor someone who doesn't have the $400 phone or watch
p53
aVtracking their every movement?
p54
aVDo they now become a burden on the medical system?
p55
aVIs their experience changed?
p56
aa(lp57
VIn the world of finance, Bitcoin and crypto-currencies
p58
aVare revolutionizing the way we move money around the world,
p59
aVbut the challenge with these technologies
p60
aVis the barrier to entry is incredibly high, right?
p61
aVYou need access to the same phones, devices, connectivity,
p62
aVand even where you don't, where you can find a proxy agent,
p63
aVusually they require a certain amount of capital to participate.
p64
aVAnd so the question that I ask myself is, what happens to the last community
p65
aVusing paper notes when the rest of the world moves to digital currency?
p66
aa(lp67
VAnother example from my hometown in Philadelphia:
p68
aVI recently went to the public library there,
p69
aVand they are facing an existential crisis.
p70
aVPublic funding is dwindling,
p71
aVthey have to reduce their footprint to stay open and stay relevant,
p72
aVand so one of the ways they're going about this
p73
aVis digitizing a number of the books and moving them to the cloud.
p74
aVThis is great for most kids. Right?
p75
aVYou can check out books from home,
p76
aVyou can research on the way to school or from school,
p77
aVbut these are really two big assumptions,
p78
aVthat one, you have access at home,
p79
aVand two, that you have access to a mobile phone,
p80
aVand in Philadelphia, many kids do not.
p81
aVSo what does their education experience look like
p82
aVin the wake of a completely cloud-based library,
p83
aVwhat used to be considered such a basic part of education?
p84
aVHow do they stay competitive?
p85
aa(lp86
VA final example from across the world in East Africa:
p87
aVthere's been a huge movement to digitize land ownership rights,
p88
aVfor a number of reasons.
p89
aVMigrant communities, older generations dying off,
p90
aVand ultimately poor record-keeping
p91
aVhave led to conflicts over who owns what.
p92
aVAnd so there was a big movement to put all this information online,
p93
aVto track all the ownership of these plots of land,
p94
aVput them in the cloud, and give them to the communities.
p95
aVBut actually, the unintended consequence of this
p96
aVhas been that venture capitalists, investors, real estate developers,
p97
aVhave swooped in and they've begun buying up these plots of land
p98
aVright out from under these communities,
p99
aVbecause they have access to the technologies
p100
aVand the connectivity that makes that possible.
p101
aa(lp102
VSo that's the common thread that connects these examples,
p103
aVthe unintended consequences of the tools and the technologies that we make.
p104
aVAs engineers, as technologists,
p105
aVwe sometimes prefer efficiency over efficacy.
p106
aVWe think more about doing things than the outcomes of what we are doing.
p107
aVThis needs to change.
p108
aVWe have a responsibility to think about the outcomes of the technologies we build,
p109
aVespecially as they increasingly control the world in which we live.
p110
aVIn the late '90s,
p111
aVthere was a big push for ethics in the world of investment and banking.
p112
aVI think in 2014, we're long overdue for a similar movement
p113
aVin the area of tech and technology.
p114
aa(lp115
VSo, I just encourage you, as you are all thinking about the next big thing,
p116
aVas entrepreneurs, as CEOs, as engineers, as makers,
p117
aVthat you think about the unintended consequences
p118
aVof the things that you're building,
p119
aVbecause the real innovation is in finding ways to include everyone.
p120
