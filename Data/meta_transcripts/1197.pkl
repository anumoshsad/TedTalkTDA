VCities are the crucible of civilization.
p4
aVThey have been expanding,
p5
aVurbanization has been expanding,
p6
aVat an exponential rate in the last 200 years
p7
aVso that by the second part of this century,
p8
aVthe planet will be completely dominated
p9
aVby cities.
p10
aVCities are the origins of global warming,
p11
aVimpact on the environment,
p12
aVhealth, pollution, disease,
p13
aVfinance,
p14
aVeconomies, energy \u2014
p15
aVthey're all problems
p16
aVthat are confronted by having cities.
p17
aVThat's where all these problems come from.
p18
aVAnd the tsunami of problems that we feel we're facing
p19
aVin terms of sustainability questions
p20
aVare actually a reflection
p21
aVof the exponential increase
p22
aVin urbanization across the planet.
p23
aa(lp24
VHere's some numbers.
p25
aVTwo hundred years ago, the United States
p26
aVwas less than a few percent urbanized.
p27
aVIt's now more than 82 percent.
p28
aVThe planet has crossed the halfway mark a few years ago.
p29
aVChina's building 300 new cities
p30
aVin the next 20 years.
p31
aVNow listen to this:
p32
aVEvery week for the foreseeable future,
p33
aVuntil 2050,
p34
aVevery week more than a million people
p35
aVare being added to our cities.
p36
aVThis is going to affect everything.
p37
aVEverybody in this room, if you stay alive,
p38
aVis going to be affected
p39
aVby what's happening in cities
p40
aVin this extraordinary phenomenon.
p41
aVHowever, cities,
p42
aVdespite having this negative aspect to them,
p43
aVare also the solution.
p44
aVBecause cities are the vacuum cleaners and the magnets
p45
aVthat have sucked up creative people,
p46
aVcreating ideas, innovation,
p47
aVwealth and so on.
p48
aVSo we have this kind of dual nature.
p49
aVAnd so there's an urgent need
p50
aVfor a scientific theory of cities.
p51
aa(lp52
VNow these are my comrades in arms.
p53
aVThis work has been done with an extraordinary group of people,
p54
aVand they've done all the work,
p55
aVand I'm the great bullshitter
p56
aVthat tries to bring it all together.
p57
aa(lp58
V(Laughter)
p59
aa(lp60
VSo here's the problem: This is what we all want.
p61
aVThe 10 billion people on the planet in 2050
p62
aVwant to live in places like this,
p63
aVhaving things like this,
p64
aVdoing things like this,
p65
aVwith economies that are growing like this,
p66
aVnot realizing that entropy
p67
aVproduces things like this,
p68
aVthis, this
p69
aVand this.
p70
aVAnd the question is:
p71
aVIs that what Edinburgh and London and New York
p72
aVare going to look like in 2050,
p73
aVor is it going to be this?
p74
aVThat's the question.
p75
aVI must say, many of the indicators
p76
aVlook like this is what it's going to look like,
p77
aVbut let's talk about it.
p78
aa(lp79
VSo my provocative statement
p80
aVis that we desperately need a serious scientific theory of cities.
p81
aVAnd scientific theory means quantifiable \u2014
p82
aVrelying on underlying generic principles
p83
aVthat can be made into a predictive framework.
p84
aVThat's the quest.
p85
aVIs that conceivable?
p86
aVAre there universal laws?
p87
aVSo here's two questions
p88
aVthat I have in my head when I think about this problem.
p89
aVThe first is:
p90
aVAre cities part of biology?
p91
aVIs London a great big whale?
p92
aVIs Edinburgh a horse?
p93
aVIs Microsoft a great big anthill?
p94
aVWhat do we learn from that?
p95
aVWe use them metaphorically \u2014
p96
aVthe DNA of a company, the metabolism of a city, and so on \u2014
p97
aVis that just bullshit, metaphorical bullshit,
p98
aVor is there serious substance to it?
p99
aVAnd if that is the case,
p100
aVhow come that it's very hard to kill a city?
p101
aVYou could drop an atom bomb on a city,
p102
aVand 30 years later it's surviving.
p103
aVVery few cities fail.
p104
aVAll companies die, all companies.
p105
aVAnd if you have a serious theory, you should be able to predict
p106
aVwhen Google is going to go bust.
p107
aa(lp108
VSo is that just another version
p109
aVof this?
p110
aVWell we understand this very well.
p111
aVThat is, you ask any generic question about this \u2014
p112
aVhow many trees of a given size,
p113
aVhow many branches of a given size does a tree have,
p114
aVhow many leaves,
p115
aVwhat is the energy flowing through each branch,
p116
aVwhat is the size of the canopy,
p117
aVwhat is its growth, what is its mortality?
p118
aVWe have a mathematical framework
p119
aVbased on generic universal principles
p120
aVthat can answer those questions.
p121
aVAnd the idea is can we do the same for this?
p122
aVSo the route in is recognizing
p123
aVone of the most extraordinary things about life,
p124
aVis that it is scalable,
p125
aVit works over an extraordinary range.
p126
aVThis is just a tiny range actually:
p127
aVIt's us mammals;
p128
aVwe're one of these.
p129
aVThe same principles, the same dynamics,
p130
aVthe same organization is at work
p131
aVin all of these, including us,
p132
aVand it can scale over a range of 100 million in size.
p133
aVAnd that is one of the main reasons
p134
aVlife is so resilient and robust \u2014
p135
aVscalability.
p136
aVWe're going to discuss that in a moment more.
p137
aa(lp138
VBut you know, at a local level,
p139
aVyou scale; everybody in this room is scaled.
p140
aVThat's called growth.
p141
aVHere's how you grew.
p142
aVRat, that's a rat \u2014 could have been you.
p143
aVWe're all pretty much the same.
p144
aVAnd you see, you're very familiar with this.
p145
aVYou grow very quickly and then you stop.
p146
aVAnd that line there
p147
aVis a prediction from the same theory,
p148
aVbased on the same principles,
p149
aVthat describes that forest.
p150
aVAnd here it is for the growth of a rat,
p151
aVand those points on there are data points.
p152
aVThis is just the weight versus the age.
p153
aVAnd you see, it stops growing.
p154
aVVery, very good for biology \u2014
p155
aValso one of the reasons for its great resilience.
p156
aVVery, very bad
p157
aVfor economies and companies and cities
p158
aVin our present paradigm.
p159
aVThis is what we believe.
p160
aVThis is what our whole economy
p161
aVis thrusting upon us,
p162
aVparticularly illustrated in that left-hand corner:
p163
aVhockey sticks.
p164
aVThis is a bunch of software companies \u2014
p165
aVand what it is is their revenue versus their age \u2014
p166
aVall zooming away,
p167
aVand everybody making millions and billions of dollars.
p168
aa(lp169
VOkay, so how do we understand this?
p170
aVSo let's first talk about biology.
p171
aVThis is explicitly showing you
p172
aVhow things scale,
p173
aVand this is a truly remarkable graph.
p174
aVWhat is plotted here is metabolic rate \u2014
p175
aVhow much energy you need per day to stay alive \u2014
p176
aVversus your weight, your mass,
p177
aVfor all of us bunch of organisms.
p178
aVAnd it's plotted in this funny way by going up by factors of 10,
p179
aVotherwise you couldn't get everything on the graph.
p180
aVAnd what you see if you plot it
p181
aVin this slightly curious way
p182
aVis that everybody lies on the same line.
p183
aVDespite the fact that this is the most complex and diverse system
p184
aVin the universe,
p185
aVthere's an extraordinary simplicity
p186
aVbeing expressed by this.
p187
aVIt's particularly astonishing
p188
aVbecause each one of these organisms,
p189
aVeach subsystem, each cell type, each gene,
p190
aVhas evolved in its own unique environmental niche
p191
aVwith its own unique history.
p192
aVAnd yet, despite all of that Darwinian evolution
p193
aVand natural selection,
p194
aVthey've been constrained to lie on a line.
p195
aa(lp196
VSomething else is going on.
p197
aVBefore I talk about that,
p198
aVI've written down at the bottom there
p199
aVthe slope of this curve, this straight line.
p200
aVIt's three-quarters, roughly,
p201
aVwhich is less than one \u2014 and we call that sublinear.
p202
aVAnd here's the point of that.
p203
aVIt says that, if it were linear,
p204
aVthe steepest slope,
p205
aVthen doubling the size
p206
aVyou would require double the amount of energy.
p207
aVBut it's sublinear, and what that translates into
p208
aVis that, if you double the size of the organism,
p209
aVyou actually only need 75 percent more energy.
p210
aVSo a wonderful thing about all of biology
p211
aVis that it expresses an extraordinary economy of scale.
p212
aVThe bigger you are systematically,
p213
aVaccording to very well-defined rules,
p214
aVless energy per capita.
p215
aVNow any physiological variable you can think of,
p216
aVany life history event you can think of,
p217
aVif you plot it this way, looks like this.
p218
aVThere is an extraordinary regularity.
p219
aVSo you tell me the size of a mammal,
p220
aVI can tell you at the 90 percent level everything about it
p221
aVin terms of its physiology, life history, etc.
p222
aa(lp223
VAnd the reason for this is because of networks.
p224
aVAll of life is controlled by networks \u2014
p225
aVfrom the intracellular through the multicellular
p226
aVthrough the ecosystem level.
p227
aVAnd you're very familiar with these networks.
p228
aVThat's a little thing that lives inside an elephant.
p229
aVAnd here's the summary of what I'm saying.
p230
aVIf you take those networks,
p231
aVthis idea of networks,
p232
aVand you apply universal principles,
p233
aVmathematizable, universal principles,
p234
aVall of these scalings
p235
aVand all of these constraints follow,
p236
aVincluding the description of the forest,
p237
aVthe description of your circulatory system,
p238
aVthe description within cells.
p239
aVOne of the things I did not stress in that introduction
p240
aVwas that, systematically, the pace of life
p241
aVdecreases as you get bigger.
p242
aVHeart rates are slower; you live longer;
p243
aVdiffusion of oxygen and resources
p244
aVacross membranes is slower, etc.
p245
aa(lp246
VThe question is: Is any of this true
p247
aVfor cities and companies?
p248
aVSo is London a scaled up Birmingham,
p249
aVwhich is a scaled up Brighton, etc., etc.?
p250
aVIs New York a scaled up San Francisco,
p251
aVwhich is a scaled up Santa Fe?
p252
aVDon't know. We will discuss that.
p253
aVBut they are networks,
p254
aVand the most important network of cities
p255
aVis you.
p256
aVCities are just a physical manifestation
p257
aVof your interactions,
p258
aVour interactions,
p259
aVand the clustering and grouping of individuals.
p260
aVHere's just a symbolic picture of that.
p261
aVAnd here's scaling of cities.
p262
aVThis shows that in this very simple example,
p263
aVwhich happens to be a mundane example
p264
aVof number of petrol stations
p265
aVas a function of size \u2014
p266
aVplotted in the same way as the biology \u2014
p267
aVyou see exactly the same kind of thing.
p268
aa(lp269
VThere is a scaling.
p270
aVThat is that the number of petrol stations in the city
p271
aVis now given to you
p272
aVwhen you tell me its size.
p273
aVThe slope of that is less than linear.
p274
aVThere is an economy of scale.
p275
aVLess petrol stations per capita the bigger you are \u2014 not surprising.
p276
aVBut here's what's surprising.
p277
aVIt scales in the same way everywhere.
p278
aVThis is just European countries,
p279
aVbut you do it in Japan or China or Colombia,
p280
aValways the same
p281
aVwith the same kind of economy of scale
p282
aVto the same degree.
p283
aVAnd any infrastructure you look at \u2014
p284
aVwhether it's the length of roads, length of electrical lines \u2014
p285
aVanything you look at
p286
aVhas the same economy of scale scaling in the same way.
p287
aVIt's an integrated system
p288
aVthat has evolved despite all the planning and so on.
p289
aVBut even more surprising
p290
aVis if you look at socio-economic quantities,
p291
aVquantities that have no analog in biology,
p292
aVthat have evolved when we started forming communities
p293
aVeight to 10,000 years ago.
p294
aVThe top one is wages as a function of size
p295
aVplotted in the same way.
p296
aVAnd the bottom one is you lot \u2014
p297
aVsuper-creatives plotted in the same way.
p298
aVAnd what you see
p299
aVis a scaling phenomenon.
p300
aVBut most important in this,
p301
aVthe exponent, the analog to that three-quarters
p302
aVfor the metabolic rate,
p303
aVis bigger than one \u2014 it's about 1.15 to 1.2.
p304
aVHere it is,
p305
aVwhich says that the bigger you are
p306
aVthe more you have per capita, unlike biology \u2014
p307
aVhigher wages, more super-creative people per capita as you get bigger,
p308
aVmore patents per capita, more crime per capita.
p309
aa(lp310
VAnd we've looked at everything:
p311
aVmore AIDS cases, flu, etc.
p312
aVAnd here, they're all plotted together.
p313
aVJust to show you what we plotted,
p314
aVhere is income, GDP \u2014
p315
aVGDP of the city \u2014
p316
aVcrime and patents all on one graph.
p317
aVAnd you can see, they all follow the same line.
p318
aVAnd here's the statement.
p319
aVIf you double the size of a city from 100,000 to 200,000,
p320
aVfrom a million to two million, 10 to 20 million,
p321
aVit doesn't matter,
p322
aVthen systematically
p323
aVyou get a 15 percent increase
p324
aVin wages, wealth, number of AIDS cases,
p325
aVnumber of police,
p326
aVanything you can think of.
p327
aVIt goes up by 15 percent,
p328
aVand you have a 15 percent savings
p329
aVon the infrastructure.
p330
aVThis, no doubt, is the reason
p331
aVwhy a million people a week are gathering in cities.
p332
aVBecause they think that all those wonderful things \u2014
p333
aVlike creative people, wealth, income \u2014
p334
aVis what attracts them,
p335
aVforgetting about the ugly and the bad.
p336
aa(lp337
VWhat is the reason for this?
p338
aVWell I don't have time to tell you about all the mathematics,
p339
aVbut underlying this is the social networks,
p340
aVbecause this is a universal phenomenon.
p341
aVThis 15 percent rule
p342
aVis true
p343
aVno matter where you are on the planet \u2014
p344
aVJapan, Chile,
p345
aVPortugal, Scotland, doesn't matter.
p346
aVAlways, all the data shows it's the same,
p347
aVdespite the fact that these cities have evolved independently.
p348
aVSomething universal is going on.
p349
aVThe universality, to repeat, is us \u2014
p350
aVthat we are the city.
p351
aVAnd it is our interactions and the clustering of those interactions.
p352
aVSo there it is, I've said it again.
p353
aVSo if it is those networks and their mathematical structure,
p354
aVunlike biology, which had sublinear scaling,
p355
aVeconomies of scale,
p356
aVyou had the slowing of the pace of life
p357
aVas you get bigger.
p358
aVIf it's social networks with super-linear scaling \u2014
p359
aVmore per capita \u2014
p360
aVthen the theory says
p361
aVthat you increase the pace of life.
p362
aVThe bigger you are, life gets faster.
p363
aVOn the left is the heart rate showing biology.
p364
aVOn the right is the speed of walking
p365
aVin a bunch of European cities,
p366
aVshowing that increase.
p367
aa(lp368
VLastly, I want to talk about growth.
p369
aVThis is what we had in biology, just to repeat.
p370
aVEconomies of scale
p371
aVgave rise to this sigmoidal behavior.
p372
aVYou grow fast and then stop \u2014
p373
aVpart of our resilience.
p374
aVThat would be bad for economies and cities.
p375
aVAnd indeed, one of the wonderful things about the theory
p376
aVis that if you have super-linear scaling
p377
aVfrom wealth creation and innovation,
p378
aVthen indeed you get, from the same theory,
p379
aVa beautiful rising exponential curve \u2014 lovely.
p380
aVAnd in fact, if you compare it to data,
p381
aVit fits very well
p382
aVwith the development of cities and economies.
p383
aVBut it has a terrible catch,
p384
aVand the catch
p385
aVis that this system is destined to collapse.
p386
aVAnd it's destined to collapse for many reasons \u2014
p387
aVkind of Malthusian reasons \u2014 that you run out of resources.
p388
aVAnd how do you avoid that? Well we've done it before.
p389
aa(lp390
VWhat we do is,
p391
aVas we grow and we approach the collapse,
p392
aVa major innovation takes place
p393
aVand we start over again,
p394
aVand we start over again as we approach the next one, and so on.
p395
aVSo there's this continuous cycle of innovation
p396
aVthat is necessary
p397
aVin order to sustain growth and avoid collapse.
p398
aVThe catch, however, to this
p399
aVis that you have to innovate
p400
aVfaster and faster and faster.
p401
aVSo the image
p402
aVis that we're not only on a treadmill that's going faster,
p403
aVbut we have to change the treadmill faster and faster.
p404
aVWe have to accelerate on a continuous basis.
p405
aVAnd the question is: Can we, as socio-economic beings,
p406
aVavoid a heart attack?
p407
aa(lp408
VSo lastly, I'm going to finish up in this last minute or two
p409
aVasking about companies.
p410
aVSee companies, they scale.
p411
aVThe top one, in fact, is Walmart on the right.
p412
aVIt's the same plot.
p413
aVThis happens to be income and assets
p414
aVversus the size of the company as denoted by its number of employees.
p415
aVWe could use sales, anything you like.
p416
aVThere it is: after some little fluctuations at the beginning,
p417
aVwhen companies are innovating,
p418
aVthey scale beautifully.
p419
aVAnd we've looked at 23,000 companies
p420
aVin the United States, may I say.
p421
aVAnd I'm only showing you a little bit of this.
p422
aa(lp423
VWhat is astonishing about companies
p424
aVis that they scale sublinearly
p425
aVlike biology,
p426
aVindicating that they're dominated,
p427
aVnot by super-linear
p428
aVinnovation and ideas;
p429
aVthey become dominated
p430
aVby economies of scale.
p431
aVIn that interpretation,
p432
aVby bureaucracy and administration,
p433
aVand they do it beautifully, may I say.
p434
aVSo if you tell me the size of some company, some small company,
p435
aVI could have predicted the size of Walmart.
p436
aVIf it has this sublinear scaling,
p437
aVthe theory says
p438
aVwe should have sigmoidal growth.
p439
aVThere's Walmart. Doesn't look very sigmoidal.
p440
aVThat's what we like, hockey sticks.
p441
aVBut you notice, I've cheated,
p442
aVbecause I've only gone up to '94.
p443
aVLet's go up to 2008.
p444
aVThat red line is from the theory.
p445
aVSo if I'd have done this in 1994,
p446
aVI could have predicted what Walmart would be now.
p447
aVAnd then this is repeated
p448
aVacross the entire spectrum of companies.
p449
aVThere they are. That's 23,000 companies.
p450
aVThey all start looking like hockey sticks,
p451
aVthey all bend over,
p452
aVand they all die like you and me.
