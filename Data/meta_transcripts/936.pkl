VMy name's Seth Priebatsch. I'm the chief ninja of SCVNGR.
p4
aVI'm a proud Princeton dropout.
p5
aVAlso proud to have relocated here to Boston,
p6
aVwhere I actually grew up.
p7
aa(lp8
V(Applause) Yeah, Boston.
p9
aa(lp10
VEasy wins, I should just name the counties that we've got around here.
p11
aVI'm also fairly determined to try and build
p12
aVa game layer on top of the world.
p13
aVThis is sort of a new concept and it's really important,
p14
aVbecause while the last decade was the decade of social,
p15
aVthe decade where the framework in which we connect with other people was built,
p16
aVthis next decade will be the decade where the game framework is built,
p17
aVwhere the motivations we use to actually influence behavior
p18
aVand the framework in which that is constructed,
p19
aVis decided upon, and that's really important.
p20
aa(lp21
VI say I want to build a game layer on top of the world,
p22
aVbut that's not quite true,
p23
aVbecause it's already under construction; it's already happening.
p24
aVAnd it looks like this right now.
p25
aVIt looks like the Web did back in 1997, right?
p26
aVIt's not very good. It's cluttered.
p27
aVIt's filled with lots of different things that, in short, aren't that fun.
p28
aVThere are credit card schemes and airline mile programs,
p29
aVcoupon cards and all these loyalty schemes
p30
aVthat actually do use game dynamics and are building the game layer \u2014
p31
aVthey just suck.
p32
aVThey're not very well-designed.
p33
aa(lp34
V(Laughter)
p35
aa(lp36
VSo that's unfortunate.
p37
aVBut luckily, as my favorite action hero, Bob the Builder, says,
p38
aV"We can do better. We can build this better."
p39
aVAnd the tools, the resources that we use to build a game layer,
p40
aVare game dynamics themselves.
p41
aVAnd so the crux of this presentation is going to go through
p42
aVfour really important game dynamics,
p43
aVreally interesting things, that, if you use consciously,
p44
aVyou can use to influence behavior,
p45
aVboth for good, for bad, for in-between.
p46
aVHopefully for good.
p47
aVBut this is the important stage in which that framework will get built,
p48
aVand so we want to all be thinking about it consciously now.
p49
aa(lp50
VBefore we jump into that, there's a question of:
p51
aVWhy is this important?
p52
aVI'm making this claim
p53
aVthat there's a game layer on top of the world,
p54
aVand it's very important that we build it properly.
p55
aVThe reason it's so important is that, in the last decade,
p56
aVwhat we've seen has been building the social layer,
p57
aVhas been this framework for connections,
p58
aVand construction on that layer is over, it's finished.
p59
aVThere's still a lot to explore,
p60
aVstill a lot of people trying to figure out social
p61
aVand how we leverage this and how we use this,
p62
aVbut the framework itself is done,
p63
aVand it's called Facebook.
p64
aVAnd that's OK, right? A lot of people are very happy with Facebook.
p65
aVI like it quite a lot.
p66
aVThey've created this thing called the Open Graph,
p67
aVand they own all of our connections.
p68
aVThey own half a billion people.
p69
aVSo when you want to build on the social layer,
p70
aVthe framework has been decided; it is the Open Graph API.
p71
aVAnd if you're happy with that, fantastic.
p72
aVIf you're not, too bad. There's nothing you can do.
p73
aa(lp74
VAnd that's a real thing.
p75
aVI mean, we want to build frameworks in a way that makes it acceptable
p76
aVand makes it productive down the road.
p77
aVSo, the social layer is all about these connections.
p78
aVThe game layer is all about influence.
p79
aVIt's not about adding a social fabric to the web
p80
aVand connecting you to other people
p81
aVeverywhere you are and everywhere you go,
p82
aVit's actually about using dynamics, using forces,
p83
aVto influence the behavior of where you are, what you do there,
p84
aVhow you do it.
p85
aVThat's really, really powerful.
p86
aVAnd it's going to be more important than the social layer,
p87
aVand affect our lives more deeply and perhaps more invisibly.
p88
aVSo it's incredibly critical that at this moment,
p89
aVwhile it's just getting constructed,
p90
aVwhile the frameworks like Facebook or Open Graph
p91
aVare being created for the game-layer equivalent,
p92
aVthat we think about it very consciously,
p93
aVand that we do it in a way that is open, available,
p94
aVand can be leveraged for good.
p95
aa(lp96
VSo that's what I want to talk about for game dynamics,
p97
aVbecause construction has just begun,
p98
aVand the more consciously we can think about this,
p99
aVthe better we'll be able to use it for anything we want.
p100
aVSo like I said, the way you go through and build on the game layer
p101
aVis not with glass and steel and cement.
p102
aVAnd the resources we use are not this two-dimensional swath of land
p103
aVthat we have.
p104
aVThe resources are mindshare,
p105
aVand the tools, the raw materials, are these game dynamics.
p106
aVWith that, a couple game dynamics to talk about.
p107
aVBack at SCVNGR, we like to joke
p108
aVthat with seven game dynamics, you can get anyone to do anything.
p109
aVToday, I'm going to show you four,
p110
aVbecause I hope to have a competitive advantage at the end of this, still.
p111
aa(lp112
V(Laughter)
p113
aa(lp114
VSo the first one, it's a very simple game dynamic.
p115
aVIt's called the appointment dynamic.
p116
aVIt's a dynamic in which to succeed,
p117
aVplayers have to do something at a predefined time,
p118
aVgenerally at a predefined place.
p119
aVAnd these dynamics are a little scary sometimes,
p120
aVbecause you think, "Other people can be using forces
p121
aVthat will manipulate how I interact:
p122
aVwhat I do, where I do it, when I do it."
p123
aVThis sort of "loss of free will" that occurs in games
p124
aVcan be frightening.
p125
aVSo with each dynamic, I'm going to give three examples:
p126
aVone that shows how it's already being used in the real world,
p127
aVso you can rationalize it a bit;
p128
aVone that shows it in what we consider a conventional game \u2014
p129
aVI think everything is a game,
p130
aVbut this is more what you'd think of as a game played on a board
p131
aVor on a computer screen;
p132
aVand one of how it can be used for good,
p133
aVso you can see that these forces can be very powerful.
p134
aa(lp135
VSo the first one, the most famous appointment dynamic in the world,
p136
aVis something called, "Happy Hour."
p137
aVSo I had just recently dropped out of Princeton
p138
aVand actually ended up for the first time in a bar,
p139
aVand I saw these happy hour things all over the place.
p140
aVAnd this is simply an appointment dynamic: come here at a certain time,
p141
aVget your drinks half off.
p142
aVTo win, all you have to do is show up at the right place at the right time.
p143
aVThis game dynamic is so powerful,
p144
aVit doesn't just influence our behavior; it's influenced our entire culture.
p145
aVThat's a really scary thought,
p146
aVthat one game dynamic can change things so powerfully.
p147
aa(lp148
VIt also exists in more conventional game forms.
p149
aVI'm sure you've all heard of Farmville by now.
p150
aVIf you haven't, I recommend playing it.
p151
aVYou won't do anything else for the rest of your day.
p152
aVFarmville has more active users than Twitter.
p153
aVIt's incredibly powerful,
p154
aVand it has this dynamic where you have to return at a certain time
p155
aVto water your fake crops, or they wilt.
p156
aVAnd this is so powerful that when they tweak their stats,
p157
aVwhen they say your crops wilt
p158
aVafter eight hours, or after six hours, or after 24 hours,
p159
aVit changes the life cycle of some 70 million people during the day.
p160
aVThey will return, like clockwork, at different times.
p161
aVSo if they wanted the world to end, if they wanted productivity to stop,
p162
aVthey could make it a 30-minute cycle,
p163
aVand no one could do anything else, right?
p164
aa(lp165
V(Laughter)
p166
aa(lp167
VThat's a little scary.
p168
aVBut this could also be used for good.
p169
aVThis local company called Vitality
p170
aVhas created a product to help people take their medicine on time.
p171
aVThat's an appointment.
p172
aVIt's something that people don't do very well.
p173
aVThey have these GlowCaps which flash and email you
p174
aVand do cool things to remind you to take your medicine.
p175
aVThis isn't a game yet, but really should be.
p176
aVYou should get points for doing it on time
p177
aVand lose points for not doing it on time.
p178
aVThey should recognize they've built an appointment dynamic,
p179
aVand leverage the games.
p180
aVThen you can really achieve good in some interesting ways.
p181
aa(lp182
VWe're going to jump onto the next one.
p183
aVInfluence and status.
p184
aVThis is one of the most famous game dynamics, used all over the place.
p185
aVIt's used in your wallets, right now.
p186
aVWe all want that credit card on the far left, because it's black.
p187
aVAnd you see someone at CVS or \u2014
p188
aVnot CVS \u2014 like, Christian Dior \u2014
p189
aa(lp190
V(Laughter)
p191
aa(lp192
VI don't know. I don't have a black card; I've got a debit card.
p193
aa(lp194
V(Laughter)
p195
aa(lp196
VSo they whip it out and you see that black card, and:
p197
aV"I want that because it means they're cooler than I am,
p198
aVand I need that."
p199
aVAnd this is used in games as well.
p200
aV"Modern Warfare," one of the most successful selling games of all time.
p201
aVI'm only a level four, but I desperately want to be a level 10,
p202
aVbecause they've got that cool red badge,
p203
aVand that means that I am somehow better than everyone else.
p204
aVAnd that's very powerful to me.
p205
aVStatus is really good motivator.
p206
aa(lp207
VIt's also used in more conventional settings,
p208
aVand can be used more consciously there.
p209
aVSchool \u2014 and remember, I made it through one year,
p210
aVso I think I'm qualified to talk on school \u2014
p211
aVis a game; it's just not a terribly well-designed game.
p212
aVThere are levels. There are C. There are B. There's A.
p213
aVThere are statuses. I mean, what is valedictorian, but a status?
p214
aVIf we called valedictorian a "White Knight Paladin level 20,"
p215
aVI think people would probably work a lot harder.
p216
aa(lp217
V(Laughter)
p218
aa(lp219
V(Applause)
p220
aa(lp221
VSo school is a game,
p222
aVand there has been lots of experimentation on how we do this properly.
p223
aVBut let's use it consciously.
p224
aVWhy have games you can lose? Why go from an A to an F or a B to a C?
p225
aVThat sucks. Why not level-up?
p226
aVAt Princeton, they've actually experimented with this,
p227
aVwith quizzes where you gain experience points,
p228
aVand you level up from B to an A.
p229
aVAnd it's very powerful.
p230
aVIt can be used in interesting ways.
p231
aa(lp232
VThe third one I'll talk about is the progression dynamic,
p233
aVwhere you have to make progress, move through different steps
p234
aVin a very granular fashion.
p235
aVThis is used all over the place, including LinkedIn,
p236
aVwhere I am an unwhole individual.
p237
aVI am only 85 percent complete on LinkedIn,
p238
aVand that bothers me.
p239
aVAnd this is so deep-seated in our psyche
p240
aVthat when we're presented with a progress bar
p241
aVand presented with easy, granular steps to take
p242
aVto try and complete that progress bar, we will do it.
p243
aVWe will find a way to move that blue line
p244
aVall the way to the right edge of the screen.
p245
aa(lp246
VThis is used in conventional games as well.
p247
aVI mean, this is a Paladin level 10,
p248
aVand that's a Paladin level 20.
p249
aVAnd if you were going to fight Orcs on the fields of Mordor
p250
aVagainst the Ra's Al Ghul,
p251
aVyou'd probably want to be the bigger one, right?
p252
aVI would.
p253
aVAnd so people work very hard to level-up.
p254
aV"World of Warcraft" is one of the most successful games of all time.
p255
aVThe average player spends some six, six-and-a-half hours a day on it,
p256
aVtheir most dedicated players \u2014 it's like a full-time job, it's insane.
p257
aVAnd they have these systems where you can level-up.
p258
aVAnd that's a very powerful thing. Progression is powerful.
p259
aa(lp260
VIt can also be used in very compelling ways for good.
p261
aVOne of the things we work on at SCVNGR is:
p262
aVHow do you use games to drive traffic and business to local businesses,
p263
aVto something that is very key to the economy?
p264
aVAnd here, we have a game that people play.
p265
aVThey go places, do challenges, earn points.
p266
aVAnd we've introduced a progression dynamic into it,
p267
aVwhere, by going to the same place over and over, doing challenges,
p268
aVengaging with the business,
p269
aVyou move a green bar from the left edge of the screen to the right,
p270
aVand unlock rewards.
p271
aVThis is powerful enough that we can see it hooks people into these dynamics,
p272
aVpulls them back to the same local businesses,
p273
aVcreates loyalty, creates engagement,
p274
aVand is able to drive meaningful revenue and fun and engagement to businesses.
p275
aVThese progression dynamics are powerful and can be used in the real world.
p276
aa(lp277
VThe final one I want to talk about \u2014 and it's a great one to end on \u2014
p278
aVis this concept of communal discovery,
p279
aVa dynamic in which everyone has to work together to achieve something.
p280
aVCommunal discovery is powerful
p281
aVbecause it leverages the network that is society
p282
aVto solve problems.
p283
aVThis is used in some famous consumer web stories like Digg,
p284
aVwhich I'm sure you've all heard of.
p285
aVDigg is a communal dynamic
p286
aVto try to find and source the best news, the most interesting stories.
p287
aVAnd they made this into a game, initially.
p288
aVThey had a leader board where, if you recommended the best stories,
p289
aVyou would get points.
p290
aVAnd that really motivated people to find the best stories.
p291
aVBut it became so powerful, there was actually a cabal,
p292
aVa group of people, the top seven on the leader board,
p293
aVwho would work together to make sure they maintained that position,
p294
aVrecommending people's stories.
p295
aa(lp296
VThe game became more powerful than the goal.
p297
aVThey ended up shutting down the leader board because, while it was effective,
p298
aVit was so powerful that it stopped sourcing the best stories,
p299
aVand started having people work to maintain leadership.
p300
aVSo we have to use this one carefully.
p301
aVIt's also used in things like McDonald's Monopoly,
p302
aVwhere the game is not the Monopoly you're playing,
p303
aVbut the cottage industries that form to try and find Boardwalk.
p304
aVThere, they're just looking for a sticker that says "Boardwalk,"
p305
aVbut it can also be used to find real things.
p306
aVThis is the DARPA balloon challenge,
p307
aVwhere they hid a couple balloons all across the United States and said,
p308
aV"Use networks. Try and find these balloons fastest,
p309
aVand the winner will get $40,000."
p310
aVThe winner was a group out of MIT,
p311
aVwhere they created sort of a pyramid scheme, a network,
p312
aVwhere the first person to recommend the location of a balloon got $2,000,
p313
aVand anyone else to push that recommendation up also got a cut.
p314
aVAnd in 12 hours, they were able to find all these balloons,
p315
aVall across the country.
p316
aVReally powerful dynamic.
p317
aa(lp318
VAnd so, I've got about 20 seconds left,
p319
aVso if I'm going to leave you with anything,
p320
aVlast decade was the decade of social.
p321
aVThis next decade is the decade of games.
p322
aVWe use game dynamics to build on it. We build with mindshare.
p323
aVWe can influence behavior.
p324
aVIt's very powerful. It's very exciting.
p325
aVLet's all build it together, let's do it well and have fun playing.
