VThis is how war starts.
p4
aVOne day you're living your ordinary life,
p5
aVyou're planning to go to a party,
p6
aVyou're taking your children to school,
p7
aVyou're making a dentist appointment.
p8
aVThe next thing, the telephones go out,
p9
aVthe TVs go out, there's armed men on the street,
p10
aVthere's roadblocks.
p11
aVYour life as you know it goes into suspended animation.
p12
aVIt stops.
p13
aa(lp14
VI'm going to steal a story from a friend of mine,
p15
aVa Bosnian friend, about what happened to her,
p16
aVbecause I think it will illustrate for you exactly what it feels like.
p17
aVShe was walking to work one day in April, 1992,
p18
aVin a miniskirt and high heels. She worked in a bank.
p19
aVShe was a young mother. She was someone who liked to party.
p20
aVGreat person.
p21
aVAnd suddenly she sees a tank
p22
aVambling down the main road of Sarajevo
p23
aVknocking everything out of its path.
p24
aVShe thinks she's dreaming, but she's not.
p25
aVAnd she runs as any of us would have done
p26
aVand takes cover, and she hides behind a trash bin,
p27
aVin her high heels and her miniskirt.
p28
aVAnd as she's hiding there, she's feeling ridiculous,
p29
aVbut she's seeing this tank go by with soldiers
p30
aVand people all over the place and chaos
p31
aVand she thinks, "I feel like Alice in Wonderland
p32
aVgoing down the rabbit hole,
p33
aVdown, down, down into chaos,
p34
aVand my life will never be the same again."
p35
aa(lp36
VA few weeks later, my friend was in a crowd of people
p37
aVpushing with her infant son in her arms
p38
aVto give him to a stranger on a bus,
p39
aVwhich was one of the last buses leaving Sarajevo
p40
aVto take children out so they could be safe.
p41
aVAnd she remembers struggling with her mother to the front,
p42
aVcrowds and crowds of people, "Take my child! Take my child!"
p43
aVand passing her son to someone through a window.
p44
aVAnd she didn't see him for years.
p45
aVThe siege went on for three and a half years,
p46
aVand it was a siege without water,
p47
aVwithout power, without electricity, without heat, without food,
p48
aVin the middle of Europe, in the middle of the 20th century.
p49
aa(lp50
VI had the honor of being one of those reporters
p51
aVthat lived through that siege,
p52
aVand I say I have the honor and the privilege of being there
p53
aVbecause it's taught me everything,
p54
aVnot just about being a reporter, but about being a human being.
p55
aVI learned about compassion.
p56
aVI learned about ordinary people who could be heroes.
p57
aVI learned about sharing. I learned about camaraderie.
p58
aVMost of all, I learned about love.
p59
aVEven in the midst of terrible destruction and death and chaos,
p60
aVI learned how ordinary people could help their neighbors,
p61
aVshare food, raise their children,
p62
aVdrag someone who's being sniped at from the middle of the road
p63
aVeven though you yourself were endangering your life,
p64
aVhelping people get into taxis who were injured
p65
aVto try to take them to hospitals.
p66
aa(lp67
VI learned so much about myself.
p68
aVMartha Gellhorn, who's one of my heroes, once said,
p69
aV"You can only love one war. The rest is responsibility."
p70
aVI went on to cover many, many, many wars after that,
p71
aVso many that I lost count,
p72
aVbut there was nothing like Sarajevo.
p73
aa(lp74
VLast April, I went back to a very strange \u2014
p75
aVwhat I called a deranged high school reunion.
p76
aVWhat it was, was the 20th anniversary of the siege,
p77
aVthe beginning of the siege of Sarajevo,
p78
aVand I don't like the word "anniversary," because it sounds like a party,
p79
aVand this was not a party.
p80
aVIt was a very somber gathering of the reporters
p81
aVthat worked there during the war, humanitarian aid workers,
p82
aVand of course the brave and courageous people of Sarajevo themselves.
p83
aVAnd the thing that struck me the most,
p84
aVthat broke my heart,
p85
aVwas walking down the main street of Sarajevo,
p86
aVwhere my friend Aida saw the tank coming 20 years ago,
p87
aVand in that road were more than 12,000 red chairs,
p88
aVempty,
p89
aVand every single one of them symbolized
p90
aVa person who had died during the siege,
p91
aVjust in Sarajevo, not in all of Bosnia,
p92
aVand it stretched from one end of the city
p93
aVto a large part of it,
p94
aVand the saddest for me were the tiny little chairs
p95
aVfor the children.
p96
aa(lp97
VI now cover Syria,
p98
aVand I started reporting it because I believed that
p99
aVit needs to be done.
p100
aVI believe a story there has to be told.
p101
aVI see, again, a template of the war in Bosnia.
p102
aVAnd when I first arrived in Damascus,
p103
aVI saw this strange moment where people
p104
aVdidn't seem to believe that war was going to descend,
p105
aVand it was exactly the same in Bosnia
p106
aVand nearly every other country I've seen where war comes.
p107
aVPeople don't want to believe it's coming,
p108
aVso they don't leave, they don't leave before they can.
p109
aVThey don't get their money out.
p110
aVThey stay because you want to stay in your home.
p111
aVAnd then war and chaos descend.
p112
aa(lp113
VRwanda is a place that haunts me a lot.
p114
aVIn 1994, I briefly left Sarajevo to go report the genocide in Rwanda.
p115
aVBetween April and August, 1994,
p116
aVone million people were slaughtered.
p117
aVNow if those 12,000 chairs freaked me out
p118
aVwith the sheer number,
p119
aVI want you just for a second to think of a million people.
p120
aVAnd to give you some example, I remember
p121
aVstanding and looking down a road as far as I could see,
p122
aVat least a mile, and there were bodies piled twice my height
p123
aVof the dead.
p124
aVAnd that was just a small percentage of the dead.
p125
aVAnd there were mothers holding their children
p126
aVwho had been caught in their last death throes.
p127
aa(lp128
VSo we learn a lot from war,
p129
aVand I mention Rwanda
p130
aVbecause it is one place, like South Africa,
p131
aVwhere nearly 20 years on, there is healing.
p132
aVFifty-six percent of the parliamentarians are women,
p133
aVwhich is fantastic,
p134
aVand there's also within the national constitution now,
p135
aVyou're actually not allowed to say Hutu or Tutsi.
p136
aVYou're not allowed to identify anyone by ethnicity,
p137
aVwhich is, of course, what started the slaughter in the first place.
p138
aVAnd an aid worker friend of mine told me the most beautiful story,
p139
aVor I find it beautiful.
p140
aVThere was a group of children, mixed Hutus and Tutsis,
p141
aVand a group of women who were adopting them,
p142
aVand they lined up and one was just given to the next.
p143
aVThere was no kind of compensation for, you're a Tutsi,
p144
aVyou're a Hutu, you might have killed my mother,
p145
aVyou might have killed my father.
p146
aVThey were just brought together in this kind of reconciliation,
p147
aVand I find this remarkable.
p148
aVSo when people ask me how I continue to cover war,
p149
aVand why I continue to do it,
p150
aVthis is why.
p151
aa(lp152
VWhen I go back to Syria, next week in fact,
p153
aVwhat I see is incredibly heroic people,
p154
aVsome of them fighting for democracy,
p155
aVfor things we take for granted every single day.
p156
aVAnd that's pretty much why I do it.
p157
aa(lp158
VIn 2004, I had a little baby boy,
p159
aVand I call him my miracle child,
p160
aVbecause after seeing so much death
p161
aVand destruction and chaos and darkness in my life,
p162
aVthis ray of hope was born.
p163
aVAnd I called him Luca, which means "The bringer of light,"
p164
aVbecause he does bring light to my life.
p165
aVBut I'm talking about him because when he was four months old,
p166
aVmy foreign editor forced me to go back to Baghdad
p167
aVwhere I had been reporting all throughout the Saddam regime
p168
aVand during the fall of Baghdad and afterwards,
p169
aVand I remember getting on the plane in tears,
p170
aVcrying to be separated from my son,
p171
aVand while I was there,
p172
aVa quite famous Iraqi politician who was a friend of mine
p173
aVsaid to me, "What are you doing here?
p174
aVWhy aren't you home with Luca?"
p175
aVAnd I said, "Well, I have to see." It was 2004
p176
aVwhich was the beginning of the incredibly bloody time in Iraq,
p177
aV"I have to see, I have to see what is happening here.
p178
aVI have to report it."
p179
aVAnd he said, "Go home,
p180
aVbecause if you miss his first tooth,
p181
aVif you miss his first step, you'll never forgive yourself.
p182
aVBut there will always be another war."
p183
aa(lp184
VAnd there, sadly, will always be wars.
p185
aVAnd I am deluding myself if I think, as a journalist,
p186
aVas a reporter, as a writer,
p187
aVwhat I do can stop them. I can't.
p188
aVI'm not Kofi Annan. He can't stop a war.
p189
aVHe tried to negotiate Syria and couldn't do it.
p190
aVI'm not a U.N. conflict resolution person.
p191
aVI'm not even a humanitarian aid doctor,
p192
aVand I can't tell you the times of how helpless I've felt
p193
aVto have people dying in front of me, and I couldn't save them.
p194
aVAll I am is a witness.
p195
aVMy role is to bring a voice to people who are voiceless.
p196
aVA colleague of mine described it as to shine a light
p197
aVin the darkest corners of the world.
p198
aVAnd that's what I try to do.
p199
aVI'm not always successful,
p200
aVand sometimes it's incredibly frustrating,
p201
aVbecause you feel like you're writing into a void,
p202
aVor you feel like no one cares.
p203
aVWho cares about Syria? Who cares about Bosnia?
p204
aVWho cares about the Congo,
p205
aVthe Ivory Coast, Liberia, Sierra Leone,
p206
aVall of these strings of places that
p207
aVI will remember for the rest of my life?
p208
aVBut my métier is to bear witness
p209
aVand that is the crux, the heart of the matter,
p210
aVfor us reporters who do this.
p211
aVAnd all I can really do is hope,
p212
aVnot to policymakers or politicians,
p213
aVbecause as much as I'd like to have faith
p214
aVthat they read my words and do something,
p215
aVI don't delude myself.
p216
aa(lp217
VBut what I do hope is that if you remember anything I said
p218
aVor any of my stories tomorrow morning over breakfast,
p219
aVif you can remember the story of Sarajevo,
p220
aVor the story of Rwanda,
p221
aVthen I've done my job.
p222
aa(lp223
VThank you very much.
