VThis is a photograph
p4
aVof a man whom for many years
p5
aVI plotted to kill.
p6
aa(lp7
VThis is my father,
p8
aVClinton George "Bageye" Grant.
p9
aVHe's called Bageye because he has
p10
aVpermanent bags under his eyes.
p11
aVAs a 10-year-old, along with my siblings,
p12
aVI dreamt of scraping off the poison
p13
aVfrom fly-killer paper into his coffee,
p14
aVgrounded down glass and sprinkling it
p15
aVover his breakfast,
p16
aVloosening the carpet on the stairs
p17
aVso he would trip and break his neck.
p18
aVBut come the day, he would always
p19
aVskip that loose step,
p20
aVhe would always bow out of the house
p21
aVwithout so much as a swig of coffee
p22
aVor a bite to eat.
p23
aVAnd so for many years,
p24
aVI feared that my father would die
p25
aVbefore I had a chance to kill him.
p26
aV(Laughter)
p27
aa(lp28
VUp until our mother asked him to leave
p29
aVand not come back,
p30
aVBageye had been a terrifying ogre.
p31
aVHe teetered permanently on the verge of rage,
p32
aVrather like me, as you see.
p33
aVHe worked nights at Vauxhall Motors in Luton
p34
aVand demanded total silence throughout the house,
p35
aVso that when we came home from school
p36
aVat 3:30 in the afternoon, we would huddle
p37
aVbeside the TV, and rather like safe-crackers,
p38
aVwe would twiddle with the volume control knob
p39
aVon the TV so it was almost inaudible.
p40
aVAnd at times, when we were like this,
p41
aVso much "Shhh," so much "Shhh"
p42
aVgoing on in the house
p43
aVthat I imagined us to be like
p44
aVthe German crew of a U-boat
p45
aVcreeping along the edge of the ocean
p46
aVwhilst up above, on the surface,
p47
aVHMS Bageye patrolled
p48
aVready to drop death charges
p49
aVat the first sound of any disturbance.
p50
aa(lp51
VSo that lesson was the lesson that
p52
aV"Do not draw attention to yourself
p53
aVeither in the home or outside of the home."
p54
aVMaybe it's a migrant lesson.
p55
aVWe were to be below the radar,
p56
aVso there was no communication, really,
p57
aVbetween Bageye and us and us and Bageye,
p58
aVand the sound that we most looked forward to,
p59
aVyou know when you're a child and you want
p60
aVyour father to come home and it's all going to be happy
p61
aVand you're waiting for that sound of the door opening.
p62
aVWell the sound that we looked forward to
p63
aVwas the click of the door closing,
p64
aVwhich meant he'd gone and would not come back.
p65
aa(lp66
VSo for three decades,
p67
aVI never laid eyes on my father, nor he on me.
p68
aVWe never spoke to each other for three decades,
p69
aVand then a couple of years ago, I decided
p70
aVto turn the spotlight on him.
p71
aa(lp72
V"You are being watched.
p73
aVActually, you are.
p74
aVYou are being watched."
p75
aVThat was his mantra to us, his children.
p76
aVTime and time again he would say this to us.
p77
aVAnd this was the 1970s, it was Luton,
p78
aVwhere he worked at Vauxhall Motors,
p79
aVand he was a Jamaican.
p80
aVAnd what he meant was,
p81
aVyou as a child of a Jamaican immigrant
p82
aVare being watched
p83
aVto see which way you turn, to see whether
p84
aVyou conform to the host nation's stereotype of you,
p85
aVof being feckless, work-shy,
p86
aVdestined for a life of crime.
p87
aVYou are being watched,
p88
aVso confound their expectations of you.
p89
aVTo that end, Bageye and his friends,
p90
aVmostly Jamaican,
p91
aVexhibited a kind of Jamaican bella figura:
p92
aVTurn your best side to the world,
p93
aVshow your best face to the world.
p94
aa(lp95
VIf you have seen some of the images
p96
aVof the Caribbean people arriving
p97
aVin the '40s and '50s,
p98
aVyou might have noticed that a lot of the men
p99
aVwear trilbies.
p100
aVNow, there was no tradition of wearing trilbies in Jamaica.
p101
aVThey invented that tradition for their arrival here.
p102
aVThey wanted to project themselves in a way
p103
aVthat they wanted to be perceived,
p104
aVso that the way they looked
p105
aVand the names that they gave themselves
p106
aVdefined them.
p107
aVSo Bageye is bald and has baggy eyes.
p108
aVTidy Boots is very fussy about his footwear.
p109
aVAnxious is always anxious.
p110
aVClock has one arm longer than the other.
p111
aV(Laughter)
p112
aVAnd my all-time favorite was the guy they called Summerwear.
p113
aVWhen Summerwear came to this country
p114
aVfrom Jamaica in the early '60s, he insisted
p115
aVon wearing light summer suits,
p116
aVno matter the weather,
p117
aVand in the course of researching their lives,
p118
aVI asked my mom, "Whatever became of Summerwear?"
p119
aVAnd she said, "He caught a cold and died." (Laughter)
p120
aVBut men like Summerwear
p121
aVtaught us the importance of style.
p122
aVMaybe they exaggerated their style
p123
aVbecause they thought that they were not considered
p124
aVto be quite civilized,
p125
aVand they transferred that generational attitude
p126
aVor anxiety onto us, the next generation,
p127
aVso much so that when I was growing up,
p128
aVif ever on the television news or radio
p129
aVa report came up about a black person
p130
aVcommitting some crime \u2014
p131
aVa mugging, a murder, a burglary \u2014
p132
aVwe winced along with our parents,
p133
aVbecause they were letting the side down.
p134
aVYou did not just represent yourself.
p135
aVYou represented the group,
p136
aVand it was a terrifying thing to come to terms with,
p137
aVin a way, that maybe you were going
p138
aVto be perceived in the same light.
p139
aVSo that was what needed to be challenged.
p140
aVOur father and many of his colleagues
p141
aVexhibited a kind of transmission but not receiving.
p142
aVThey were built to transmit but not receive.
p143
aVWe were to keep quiet.
p144
aVWhen our father did speak to us,
p145
aVit was from the pulpit of his mind.
p146
aVThey clung to certainty in the belief
p147
aVthat doubt would undermine them.
p148
aVBut when I am working in my house
p149
aVand writing, after a day's writing, I rush downstairs
p150
aVand I'm very excited to talk about Marcus Garvey or Bob Marley
p151
aVand words are tripping out of my mouth like butterflies
p152
aVand I'm so excited that my children stop me,
p153
aVand they say, "Dad, nobody cares."
p154
aV(Laughter)
p155
aa(lp156
VBut they do care, actually.
p157
aVThey cross over.
p158
aVSomehow they find their way to you.
p159
aVThey shape their lives according to the narrative of your life,
p160
aVas I did with my father and my mother, perhaps,
p161
aVand maybe Bageye did with his father.
p162
aVAnd that was clearer to me
p163
aVin the course of looking at his life
p164
aVand understanding, as they say,
p165
aVthe Native Americans say,
p166
aV"Do not criticize the man until you can walk
p167
aVin his moccasins."
p168
aa(lp169
VBut in conjuring his life, it was okay
p170
aVand very straightforward to portray
p171
aVa Caribbean life in England in the 1970s
p172
aVwith bowls of plastic fruit,
p173
aVpolystyrene ceiling tiles,
p174
aVsettees permanently sheathed
p175
aVin their transparent covers that they were delivered in.
p176
aVBut what's more difficult to navigate
p177
aVis the emotional landscape
p178
aVbetween the generations,
p179
aVand the old adage that with age comes wisdom
p180
aVis not true.
p181
aVWith age comes the veneer of respectability
p182
aVand a veneer of uncomfortable truths.
p183
aa(lp184
VBut what was true was that my parents,
p185
aVmy mother, and my father went along with it,
p186
aVdid not trust the state to educate me.
p187
aVSo listen to how I sound.
p188
aVThey determined that they would send me to a private school,
p189
aVbut my father worked at Vauxhall Motors.
p190
aVIt's quite difficult to fund a private school education
p191
aVand feed his army of children.
p192
aVI remember going on to the school
p193
aVfor the entrance exam, and my father said
p194
aVto the priest \u2014 it was a Catholic school \u2014
p195
aVhe wanted a better "heducation" for the boy,
p196
aVbut also, he, my father,
p197
aVnever even managed to pass worms,
p198
aVnever mind entrance exams.
p199
aVBut in order to fund my education,
p200
aVhe was going to have to do some dodgy stuff,
p201
aVso my father would fund my education
p202
aVby trading in illicit goods from the back of his car,
p203
aVand that was made even more tricky because
p204
aVmy father, that's not his car by the way.
p205
aVMy father aspired to have a car like that,
p206
aVbut my father had a beaten-up Mini,
p207
aVand he never, being a Jamaican coming to this country,
p208
aVhe never had a driving license,
p209
aVhe never had any insurance or road tax or MOT.
p210
aVHe thought, "I know how to drive;
p211
aVwhy do I need the state's validation?"
p212
aVBut it became a little tricky when we were stopped by the police,
p213
aVand we were stopped a lot by the police,
p214
aVand I was impressed by the way
p215
aVthat my father dealt with the police.
p216
aVHe would promote the policeman immediately,
p217
aVso that P.C. Bloggs became Detective Inspector Bloggs
p218
aVin the course of the conversation
p219
aVand wave us on merrily.
p220
aVSo my father was exhibiting what we in Jamaica
p221
aVcalled "playing fool to catch wise."
p222
aVBut it lent also an idea
p223
aVthat actually he was being diminished
p224
aVor belittled by the policeman \u2014
p225
aVas a 10-year-old boy, I saw that \u2014
p226
aVbut also there was an ambivalence towards authority.
p227
aVSo on the one hand, there was
p228
aVa mocking of authority,
p229
aVbut on the other hand, there was a deference
p230
aVtowards authority,
p231
aVand these Caribbean people
p232
aVhad an overbearing obedience towards authority,
p233
aVwhich is very striking, very strange in a way,
p234
aVbecause migrants are very courageous people.
p235
aVThey leave their homes. My father and my mother
p236
aVleft Jamaica and they traveled 4,000 miles,
p237
aVand yet they were infantilized by travel.
p238
aVThey were timid,
p239
aVand somewhere along the line,
p240
aVthe natural order was reversed.
p241
aVThe children became the parents to the parent.
p242
aa(lp243
VThe Caribbean people came to this country with a five-year plan:
p244
aVthey would work, some money, and then go back,
p245
aVbut the five years became 10, the 10 became 15,
p246
aVand before you know it, you're changing the wallpaper,
p247
aVand at that point, you know you're here to stay.
p248
aVAlthough there's still the kind of temporariness
p249
aVthat our parents felt about being here,
p250
aVbut we children knew that the game was up.
p251
aVI think there was a feeling that
p252
aVthey would not be able to continue with the ideals
p253
aVof the life that they expected.
p254
aVThe reality was very much different.
p255
aVAnd also, that was true of the reality
p256
aVof trying to educate me.
p257
aVHaving started the process, my father did not continue.
p258
aVIt was left to my mother to educate me,
p259
aVand as George Lamming would say,
p260
aVit was my mother who fathered me.
p261
aa(lp262
VEven in his absence, that old mantra remained:
p263
aVYou are being watched.
p264
aVBut such ardent watchfulness can lead to anxiety,
p265
aVso much so that years later, when I was investigating
p266
aVwhy so many young black men
p267
aVwere diagnosed with schizophrenia,
p268
aVsix times more than they ought to be,
p269
aVI was not surprised to hear the psychiatrist say,
p270
aV"Black people are schooled in paranoia."
p271
aVAnd I wonder what Bageye would make of that.
p272
aa(lp273
VNow I also had a 10-year-old son,
p274
aVand turned my attention to Bageye
p275
aVand I went in search of him.
p276
aVHe was back in Luton, he was now 82,
p277
aVand I hadn't seen him for 30-odd years,
p278
aVand when he opened the door,
p279
aVI saw this tiny little man with lambent, smiling eyes,
p280
aVand he was smiling, and I'd never seen him smile.
p281
aVI was very disconcerted by that.
p282
aVBut we sat down, and he had a Caribbean friend with him,
p283
aVtalking some old time talk,
p284
aVand my father would look at me,
p285
aVand he looked at me as if I would
p286
aVmiraculously disappear as I had arisen.
p287
aVAnd he turned to his friend, and he said,
p288
aV"This boy and me have a deep, deep connection,
p289
aVdeep, deep connection."
p290
aVBut I never felt that connection.
p291
aVIf there was a pulse, it was very weak
p292
aVor hardly at all.
p293
aVAnd I almost felt in the course of that reunion
p294
aVthat I was auditioning to be my father's son.
p295
aa(lp296
VWhen the book came out,
p297
aVit had fair reviews in the national papers,
p298
aVbut the paper of choice in Luton is not The Guardian,
p299
aVit's the Luton News,
p300
aVand the Luton News ran the headline about the book,
p301
aV"The Book That May Heal a 32-Year-Old Rift."
p302
aVAnd I understood that could also represent
p303
aVthe rift between one generation and the next,
p304
aVbetween people like me and my father's generation,
p305
aVbut there's no tradition in Caribbean life
p306
aVof memoirs or biographies.
p307
aVIt was a tradition that you didn't chat about your business in public.
p308
aVBut I welcomed that title, and I thought actually, yes,
p309
aVthere is a possibility that this
p310
aVwill open up conversations that we'd never had before.
p311
aVThis will close the generation gap, perhaps.
p312
aVThis could be an instrument of repair.
p313
aVAnd I even began to feel that this book
p314
aVmay be perceived by my father
p315
aVas an act of filial devotion.
p316
aa(lp317
VPoor, deluded fool.
p318
aVBageye was stung by what he perceived to be
p319
aVthe public airing of his shortcomings.
p320
aVHe was stung by my betrayal,
p321
aVand he went to the newspapers the next day
p322
aVand demanded a right of reply,
p323
aVand he got it with the headline
p324
aV"Bageye Bites Back."
p325
aVAnd it was a coruscating account of my betrayal.
p326
aVI was no son of his.
p327
aVHe recognized in his mind that his colors
p328
aVhad been dragged through the mud, and he couldn't allow that.
p329
aVHe had to restore his dignity, and he did so,
p330
aVand initially, although I was disappointed,
p331
aVI grew to admire that stance.
p332
aVThere was still fire bubbling through his veins,
p333
aVeven though he was 82 years old.
p334
aVAnd if it meant that we would now return
p335
aVto 30 years of silence,
p336
aVmy father would say, "If it's so, then it's so."
p337
aa(lp338
VJamaicans will tell you that there's no such thing as facts,
p339
aVthere are only versions.
p340
aVWe all tell ourselves the versions of the story
p341
aVthat we can best live with.
p342
aVEach generation builds up an edifice
p343
aVwhich they are reluctant or sometimes unable
p344
aVto disassemble,
p345
aVbut in the writing, my version of the story
p346
aVbegan to change,
p347
aVand it was detached from me.
p348
aVI lost my hatred of my father.
p349
aVI did no longer want him to die or to murder him,
p350
aVand I felt free,
p351
aVmuch freer than I'd ever felt before.
p352
aVAnd I wonder whether that freedness
p353
aVcould be transferred to him.
p354
aa(lp355
VIn that initial reunion,
p356
aVI was struck by an idea that I had
p357
aVvery few photographs of myself
p358
aVas a young child.
p359
aVThis is a photograph of me,
p360
aVnine months old.
p361
aVIn the original photograph,
p362
aVI'm being held up by my father, Bageye,
p363
aVbut when my parents separated, my mother
p364
aVexcised him from all aspects of our lives.
p365
aVShe took a pair of scissors and cut  him out of every photograph,
p366
aVand for years, I told myself the truth of this photograph
p367
aVwas that you are alone,
p368
aVyou are unsupported.
p369
aVBut there's another way of looking at this photograph.
p370
aVThis is a photograph that has the potential
p371
aVfor a reunion,
p372
aVa potential to be reunited with my father,
p373
aVand in my yearning to be held up by my father,
p374
aVI held him up to the light.
p375
aa(lp376
VIn that first reunion,
p377
aVit was very awkward and tense moments,
p378
aVand to lessen the tension,
p379
aVwe decided to go for a walk.
p380
aVAnd as we walked, I was struck
p381
aVthat I had reverted to being the child
p382
aVeven though I was now towering above my father.
p383
aVI was almost a foot taller than my father.
p384
aVHe was still the big man,
p385
aVand I tried to match his step.
p386
aVAnd I realized that he was walking
p387
aVas if he was still under observation,
p388
aVbut I admired his walk.
p389
aVHe walked like a man
p390
aVon the losing side of the F.A. Cup Final
p391
aVmounting the steps to collect his condolence medal.
p392
aVThere was dignity in defeat.
p393
aa(lp394
VThank you.
