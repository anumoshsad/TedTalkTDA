VSo I'm here to explain
p4
aVwhy I'm wearing these ninja pajamas.
p5
aVAnd to do that, I'd like to talk first
p6
aVabout environmental toxins in our bodies.
p7
aVSo some of you may know
p8
aVabout the chemical Bisphenol A, BPA.
p9
aVIt's a material hardener and synthetic estrogen
p10
aVthat's found in the lining of canned foods
p11
aVand some plastics.
p12
aVSo BPA mimics the body's own hormones
p13
aVand causes neurological and reproductive problems.
p14
aVAnd it's everywhere.
p15
aVA recent study found BPA
p16
aVin 93 percent of people six and older.
p17
aVBut it's just one chemical.
p18
aVThe Center for Disease Control in the U.S.
p19
aVsays we have 219 toxic pollutants in our bodies,
p20
aVand this includes preservatives, pesticides
p21
aVand heavy metals like lead and mercury.
p22
aa(lp23
VTo me, this says three things.
p24
aVFirst, don't become a cannibal.
p25
aVSecond, we are both responsible for and the victims of
p26
aVour own pollution.
p27
aVAnd third,
p28
aVour bodies are filters and storehouses
p29
aVfor environmental toxins.
p30
aVSo what happens to all these toxins when we die?
p31
aVThe short answer is:
p32
aVThey return to the environment in one way or another,
p33
aVcontinuing the cycle of toxicity.
p34
aVBut our current funeral practices
p35
aVmake the situation much worse.
p36
aVIf you're cremated,
p37
aVall those toxins I mentioned are released into the atmosphere.
p38
aVAnd this includes 5,000 pounds of mercury
p39
aVfrom our dental fillings alone every year.
p40
aa(lp41
VAnd in a traditional American funeral,
p42
aVa dead body is covered with fillers and cosmetics
p43
aVto make it look alive.
p44
aVIt's then pumped with toxic formaldehyde
p45
aVto slow decomposition \u2014
p46
aVa practice which causes respiratory problems and cancer
p47
aVin funeral personnel.
p48
aVSo by trying to preserve our dead bodies,
p49
aVwe deny death, poison the living
p50
aVand further harm the environment.
p51
aVGreen or natural burials, which don't use embalming,
p52
aVare a step in the right direction,
p53
aVbut they don't address the existing toxins in our bodies.
p54
aVI think there's a better solution.
p55
aa(lp56
VI'm an artist,
p57
aVso I'd like to offer a modest proposal
p58
aVat the intersection
p59
aVof art, science and culture.
p60
aVThe Infinity Burial Project,
p61
aVan alternative burial system
p62
aVthat uses mushrooms
p63
aVto decompose and clean toxins in bodies.
p64
aVThe Infinity Burial Project
p65
aVbegan a few years ago with a fantasy
p66
aVto create the Infinity Mushroom \u2014
p67
aVa new hybrid mushroom
p68
aVthat would decompose bodies, clean the toxins
p69
aVand deliver nutrients to plant roots,
p70
aVleaving clean compost.
p71
aVBut I learned it's nearly impossible
p72
aVto create a new hybrid mushroom.
p73
aVI also learned
p74
aVthat some of our tastiest mushrooms
p75
aVcan clean environmental toxins in soil.
p76
aVSo I thought maybe I could train an army
p77
aVof toxin-cleaning edible mushrooms
p78
aVto eat my body.
p79
aa(lp80
VSo today, I'm collecting what I shed or slough off \u2014
p81
aVmy hair, skin and nails \u2014
p82
aVand I'm feeding these to edible mushrooms.
p83
aVAs the mushrooms grow,
p84
aVI pick the best feeders
p85
aVto become Infinity Mushrooms.
p86
aVIt's a kind of imprinting and selective breeding process
p87
aVfor the afterlife.
p88
aVSo when I die,
p89
aVthe Infinity Mushrooms will recognize my body
p90
aVand be able to eat it.
p91
aVAll right, so for some of you,
p92
aVthis may be really, really out there.
p93
aV(Laughter)
p94
aVJust a little.
p95
aa(lp96
VI realize this is not the kind of relationship
p97
aVthat we usually aspire to have with our food.
p98
aVWe want to eat, not be eaten by, our food.
p99
aVBut as I watch the mushrooms grow
p100
aVand digest my body,
p101
aVI imagine the Infinity Mushroom
p102
aVas a symbol of a new way of thinking about death
p103
aVand the relationship between my body and the environment.
p104
aVSee for me,
p105
aVcultivating the Infinity Mushroom
p106
aVis more than just scientific experimentation
p107
aVor gardening or raising a pet,
p108
aVit's a step towards accepting the fact
p109
aVthat someday I will die and decay.
p110
aVIt's also a step
p111
aVtowards taking responsibility
p112
aVfor my own burden on the planet.
p113
aa(lp114
VGrowing a mushroom is also part of a larger practice
p115
aVof cultivating decomposing organisms
p116
aVcalled decompiculture,
p117
aVa concept that was developed by an entomologist,
p118
aVTimothy Myles.
p119
aVThe Infinity Mushroom is a subset of decompiculture
p120
aVI'm calling body decompiculture and toxin remediation \u2014
p121
aVthe cultivation of organisms that decompose
p122
aVand clean toxins in bodies.
p123
aa(lp124
VAnd now about these ninja pajamas.
p125
aVOnce it's completed,
p126
aVI plan to integrate the Infinity Mushrooms into a number of objects.
p127
aVFirst, a burial suit
p128
aVinfused with mushroom spores,
p129
aVthe Mushroom Death Suit.
p130
aV(Laughter)
p131
aVI'm wearing the second prototype
p132
aVof this burial suit.
p133
aVIt's covered with a crocheted netting
p134
aVthat is embedded with mushroom spores.
p135
aVThe dendritic pattern you see
p136
aVmimics the growth of mushroom mycelia,
p137
aVwhich are the equivalent of plant roots.
p138
aa(lp139
VI'm also making a decompiculture kit,
p140
aVa cocktail of capsules
p141
aVthat contain Infinity Mushroom spores
p142
aVand other elements
p143
aVthat speed decomposition and toxin remediation.
p144
aVThese capsules are embedded in a nutrient-rich jelly,
p145
aVa kind of second skin,
p146
aVwhich dissolves quickly
p147
aVand becomes baby food for the growing mushrooms.
p148
aVSo I plan to finish the mushroom and decompiculture kit
p149
aVin the next year or two,
p150
aVand then I'd like to begin testing them,
p151
aVfirst with expired meat from the market
p152
aVand then with human subjects.
p153
aVAnd believe it or not,
p154
aVa few people have offered to donate their bodies to the project
p155
aVto be eaten by mushrooms.
p156
aa(lp157
V(Laughter)
p158
aa(lp159
VWhat I've learned from talking to these folks
p160
aVis that we share a common desire
p161
aVto understand and accept death
p162
aVand to minimize the impact of our death on the environment.
p163
aVI wanted to cultivate this perspective
p164
aVjust like the mushrooms,
p165
aVso I formed the Decompiculture Society,
p166
aVa group of people called decompinauts
p167
aVwho actively explore their postmortem options,
p168
aVseek death acceptance
p169
aVand cultivate decomposing organisms
p170
aVlike the Infinity Mushroom.
p171
aVThe Decompiculture Society shares a vision
p172
aVof a cultural shift,
p173
aVfrom our current culture of death denial and body preservation
p174
aVto one of decompiculture,
p175
aVa radical acceptance of death and decomposition.
p176
aa(lp177
VAccepting death means accepting
p178
aVthat we are physical beings
p179
aVwho are intimately connected to the environment,
p180
aVas the research on environmental toxins confirms.
p181
aVAnd the saying goes,
p182
aVwe came from dust and will return to dust.
p183
aVAnd once we understand that we're connected to the environment,
p184
aVwe see that the survival of our species
p185
aVdepends on the survival of the planet.
p186
aVI believe this is the beginning
p187
aVof true environmental responsibility.
p188
aa(lp189
VThank you.
