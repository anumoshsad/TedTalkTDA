VOK. We've heard a lot of people
p4
aVspeak at this conference
p5
aVabout the power of the human mind.
p6
aVAnd what I'd like to do today
p7
aVis give you a vivid example
p8
aVof how that power can be unleashed
p9
aVwhen someone is in a survival situation,
p10
aVhow the will to survive can bring that out in people.
p11
aVThis is an incident which occurred on Mount Everest;
p12
aVit was the worst disaster in the history of Everest.
p13
aVAnd when it occurred, I was the only doctor on the mountain.
p14
aVSo I'll take you through that
p15
aVand we'll see what it's like
p16
aVwhen someone really
p17
aVsummons the will to survive.
p18
aa(lp19
VOK, this is Mount Everest.
p20
aVIt's 29,035 feet high.
p21
aVI've been there six times: Four times I did work with National Geographic,
p22
aVmaking tectonic plate measurements;
p23
aVtwice, I went with NASA
p24
aVdoing remote sensing devices.
p25
aVIt was on my fourth trip to Everest
p26
aVthat a comet passed over the mountain. Hyakutake.
p27
aVAnd the Sherpas told us then
p28
aVthat was a very bad omen,
p29
aVand we should have listened to them.
p30
aVEverest is an extreme environment.
p31
aVThere's only one-third as much oxygen at the summit as there is at sea level.
p32
aVNear the summit, temperatures
p33
aVcan be 40 degrees below zero.
p34
aVYou can have winds 20 to 40 miles an hour.
p35
aVIt's actually a wind-chill factor
p36
aVwhich is lower than a summer day on Mars.
p37
aVI remember one time being up near the summit,
p38
aVI reached into my down jacket
p39
aVfor a drink from my water bottle,
p40
aVinside my down jacket,
p41
aVonly to discover that the water was already frozen solid.
p42
aVThat gives you an idea of just how severe
p43
aVthings are near the summit.
p44
aa(lp45
VOK, this is the route up Everest.
p46
aVIt starts at base camp, at 17,500 feet.
p47
aVCamp One, 2,000 feet higher.
p48
aVCamp Two, another 2,000 feet higher up,
p49
aVwhat's called the Western Cwm.
p50
aVCampThree is at the base of Lhotse,
p51
aVwhich is the fourth highest mountain in the world, but it's dwarfed by Everest.
p52
aVAnd then Camp Four is the highest camp;
p53
aVthat's 3,000 feet short of the summit.
p54
aVThis is a view of base camp.
p55
aVThis is pitched on a glacier at 17,500 feet.
p56
aVIt's the highest point you can bring your yaks
p57
aVbefore you have to unload.
p58
aVAnd this is what they unloaded for me:
p59
aVI had four yak loads of medical supplies,
p60
aVwhich are dumped in a tent,
p61
aVand here I am trying to arrange things.
p62
aa(lp63
VThis was our expedition.
p64
aVIt was a National Geographic expedition,
p65
aVbut it was organized by The Explorers Club.
p66
aVThere were three other expeditions on the mountain,
p67
aVan American team, a New Zealand team
p68
aVand an IMAX team.
p69
aVAnd, after actually two months of preparation,
p70
aVwe built our camps all the way up the mountain.
p71
aa(lp72
VThis is a view looking up the icefall,
p73
aVthe first 2,000 feet of the climb
p74
aVup from base camp.
p75
aVAnd here's a picture in the icefall;
p76
aVit's a waterfall, but it's frozen, but it moves very slowly,
p77
aVand it actually changes every day.
p78
aVWhen you're in it, you're like a rat in a maze;
p79
aVyou can't even see over the top.
p80
aVThis is near the top of the icefall.
p81
aVYou want to climb through at night when the ice is frozen.
p82
aVThat way, it's less likely to tumble down on you.
p83
aVThese are some climbers reaching the top of the icefall just at sun-up.
p84
aVThis is me crossing a crevasse.
p85
aVWe cross on aluminum ladders with safety ropes attached.
p86
aVThat's another crevasse.
p87
aVSome of these things are 10 stories deep or more,
p88
aVand one of my climbing friends says that
p89
aVthe reason we actually climb at night
p90
aVis because if we ever saw the bottom
p91
aVof what we're climbing over,
p92
aVwe would never do it.
p93
aa(lp94
VOkay. This is Camp One.
p95
aVIt's the first flat spot you can reach
p96
aVafter you get up to the top of the icefall.
p97
aVAnd from there we climb up to Camp Two,
p98
aVwhich is sort of the foreground.
p99
aVThese are climbers moving up the Lhotse face,
p100
aVthat mountain toward Camp Three.
p101
aVThey're on fixed ropes here.
p102
aVA fall here, if you weren't roped in,
p103
aVwould be 5,000 feet down.
p104
aVThis is a view taken from camp three.
p105
aVYou can see the Lhotse face is in profile,
p106
aVit's about a 45 degree angle. It takes two days to climb it,
p107
aVso you put the camp halfway through.
p108
aa(lp109
VIf you notice, the summit of Everest is black.
p110
aVThere's no ice over it.
p111
aVAnd that's because Everest is so high,
p112
aVit's in the jet stream,
p113
aVand winds are constantly scouring the face,
p114
aVso no snow gets to accumulate.
p115
aVWhat looks like a cloud behind the summit ridge
p116
aVis actually snow being blown off the summit.
p117
aa(lp118
VThis is on the way up from Camp Three to Camp Four,
p119
aVmoving in, up through the clouds.
p120
aVAnd this is at Camp Four.
p121
aVOnce you get to Camp Four, you have maybe 24 hours
p122
aVto decide if you're going to go for the summit or not.
p123
aVEverybody's on oxygen, your supplies are limited,
p124
aVand you either have to go up or go down,
p125
aVmake that decision very quickly.
p126
aVThis is a picture of Rob Hall.
p127
aVHe was the leader of the New Zealand team.
p128
aVThis is a radio he used later to call his wife
p129
aVthat I'll tell you about.
p130
aVThese are some climbers waiting to go to the summit.
p131
aVThey're up at Camp Four, and you can see that there's wind blowing off the summit.
p132
aVThis is not good weather to climb in,
p133
aVso the climbers are just waiting, hoping that the wind's going to die down.
p134
aVAnd, in fact, the wind does die down at night.
p135
aVIt becomes very calm, there's no wind at all.
p136
aVThis looks like a good chance to go for the summit.
p137
aVSo here are some climbers starting out for the summit
p138
aVon what's called the Triangular Face.
p139
aVIt's the first part of climb.
p140
aVIt's done in the dark, because it's actually less steep than what comes next,
p141
aVand you can gain daylight hours if you do this in the dark.
p142
aa(lp143
VSo that's what happened.
p144
aVThe climbers got on the southeast ridge.
p145
aVThis is the view looking at the southeast ridge.
p146
aVThe summit would be in the foreground.
p147
aVFrom here, it's about 1,500 feet
p148
aVup at a 30-degree angle to the summit.
p149
aVBut what happened that year was
p150
aVthe wind suddenly and unexpectedly picked up.
p151
aVA storm blew in that no one was anticipating.
p152
aVYou can see here some ferocious winds
p153
aVblowing snow way high off the summit.
p154
aVAnd there were climbers on that summit ridge.
p155
aa(lp156
VThis is a picture of me in that area
p157
aVtaken a year before,
p158
aVand you can see I've got an oxygen mask on
p159
aVwith a rebreather.
p160
aVI have an oxygen hose connected here.
p161
aVYou can see on this climber, we have two oxygen tanks in the backpack \u2014
p162
aVlittle titanium tanks, very lightweight \u2014
p163
aVand we're not carrying much else.
p164
aVThis is all you've got. You're very exposed on the summit ridge.
p165
aa(lp166
VOK, this is a view taken on the summit ridge itself.
p167
aVThis is on the way toward the summit,
p168
aVon that 1,500-foot bridge.
p169
aVAll the climbers here are climbing unroped,
p170
aVand the reason is because
p171
aVthe drop off is so sheer on either side
p172
aVthat if you were roped to somebody,
p173
aVyou'd wind up just pulling them off with you.
p174
aVSo each person climbs individually.
p175
aVAnd it's not a straight path at all,
p176
aVit's very difficult climbing,
p177
aVand there's always the risk
p178
aVof falling on either side.
p179
aVIf you fall to your left, you're going to fall
p180
aV8,000 feet into Nepal;
p181
aVif you fall to your right,
p182
aVyou're going to fall 12,000 feet into Tibet.
p183
aVSo it's probably better to fall into Tibet
p184
aVbecause you'll live longer.
p185
aV(Laughter)
p186
aVBut, either way, you fall for the rest of your life.
p187
aa(lp188
VOK. Those climbers were up near the summit,
p189
aValong that summit ridge that you see up there,
p190
aVand I was down here in Camp Three.
p191
aVMy expedition was down in Camp Three,
p192
aVwhile these guys were up there in the storm.
p193
aVThe storm was so fierce that we had to lay,
p194
aVfully dressed, fully equipped,
p195
aVlaid out on the tent floor
p196
aVto stop the tent from blowing off the mountain.
p197
aVIt was the worst winds I've ever seen.
p198
aVAnd the climbers up on the ridge
p199
aVwere that much higher, 2,000 feet higher,
p200
aVand completely exposed to the elements.
p201
aVWe were in radio contact with some of them.
p202
aa(lp203
VThis is a view taken along the summit ridge.
p204
aVRob Hall, we heard by radio,
p205
aVwas up here, at this point in the storm
p206
aVwith Doug Hansen.
p207
aVAnd we heard that Rob was OK,
p208
aVbut Doug was too weak to come down.
p209
aVHe was exhausted, and Rob was staying with him.
p210
aVWe also got some bad news in the storm
p211
aVthat Beck Weathers, another climber,
p212
aVhad collapsed in the snow and was dead.
p213
aVThere were still 18 other climbers
p214
aVthat we weren't aware of their condition.
p215
aVThey were lost. There was total confusion on the mountain;
p216
aVall the stories were confusing, most of them were conflicting.
p217
aVWe really had no idea what was going on during that storm.
p218
aVWe were just hunkered down
p219
aVin our tents at Camp Three.
p220
aa(lp221
VOur two strongest climbers, Todd Burleson and Pete Athans,
p222
aVdecided to go up to try to rescue who they could
p223
aVeven though there was a ferocious storm going.
p224
aVThey tried to radio a message to Rob Hall,
p225
aVwho was a superb climber
p226
aVstuck, sort of, with a weak climber
p227
aVup near the summit.
p228
aVI expected them to say to Rob,
p229
aV"Hold on. We're coming."
p230
aVBut in fact, what they said was,
p231
aV"Leave Doug and come down yourself.
p232
aVThere's no chance of saving him,
p233
aVand just try to save yourself at this point."
p234
aVAnd Rob got that message,
p235
aVbut his answer was,
p236
aV"We're both listening."
p237
aVTodd and Pete got up to the summit ridge, up in here,
p238
aVand it was a scene of complete chaos up there.
p239
aVBut they did what they could to stabilize the people.
p240
aVI gave them radio advice from Camp Three,
p241
aVand we sent down the climbers that could make it down
p242
aVunder their own power.
p243
aVThe ones that couldn't we just sort of decided to leave up at Camp Four.
p244
aVSo the climbers were coming down along this route.
p245
aa(lp246
VThis is taken from Camp Three, where I was.
p247
aVAnd they all came by me
p248
aVso I could take a look at them and see what I could do for them,
p249
aVwhich is really not much, because Camp Three
p250
aVis a little notch cut in the ice
p251
aVin the middle of a 45-degree angle.
p252
aVYou can barely stand outside the tent.
p253
aVIt's really cold; it's 24,000 feet.
p254
aVThe only supplies I had at that altitude
p255
aVwere two plastic bags
p256
aVwith preloaded syringes
p257
aVof painkiller and steroids.
p258
aa(lp259
VSo, as the climbers came by me,
p260
aVI sort of assessed whether or not they were in condition
p261
aVto continue on further down.
p262
aVThe ones that weren't that lucid or were not that well coordinated,
p263
aVI would give an injection of steroids
p264
aVto try to give them some period
p265
aVof lucidity and coordination
p266
aVwhere they could then work their way further down the mountain.
p267
aVIt's so awkward to work up there that sometimes
p268
aVI even gave the injections right through their clothes.
p269
aVIt was just too hard to maneuver
p270
aVany other way up there.
p271
aa(lp272
VWhile I was taking care of them,
p273
aVwe got more news about Rob Hall.
p274
aVThere was no way we could get up high enough to rescue him.
p275
aVHe called in to say that he was alone now.
p276
aVApparently, Doug had died higher up on the mountain.
p277
aVBut Rob was now too weak to come down himself,
p278
aVand with the fierce winds and up at that altitude,
p279
aVhe was just beyond rescue
p280
aVand he knew it.
p281
aVAt that point, he asked
p282
aVto be paged into his wife.
p283
aVHe was carrying a radio.
p284
aVHis wife was home in New Zealand,
p285
aVseven months pregnant with their first child,
p286
aVand Rob asked to be patched into her. That was done,
p287
aVand Rob and his wife
p288
aVhad their last conversation.
p289
aVThey picked the name for their baby.
p290
aVRob then signed off,
p291
aVand that was the last we ever heard of him.
p292
aa(lp293
VI was faced with treating a lot of critically ill patients
p294
aVat 24,000 feet,
p295
aVwhich was an impossibility.
p296
aVSo what we did was, we got the victims
p297
aVdown to 21,000 feet, where it was easier for me to treat them.
p298
aVThis was my medical kit.
p299
aVIt's a tackle box filled with medical supplies.
p300
aVThis is what I carried up the mountain.
p301
aVI had more supplies lower down,
p302
aVwhich I asked to be brought up to meet me at the lower camp.
p303
aVAnd this was scene at the lower camp.
p304
aa(lp305
VThe survivors came in one by one.
p306
aVSome of them were hypothermic,
p307
aVsome of them were frostbitten, some were both.
p308
aVWhat we did was try to warm them up as best we could,
p309
aVput oxygen on them and try to revive them,
p310
aVwhich is difficult to do at 21,000 feet,
p311
aVwhen the tent is freezing.
p312
aVThis is some severe frostbite on the feet,
p313
aVsevere frostbite on the nose.
p314
aVThis climber was snow blind.
p315
aa(lp316
VAs I was taking care of these climbers,
p317
aVwe got a startling experience.
p318
aVOut of nowhere, Beck Weathers,
p319
aVwho we had already been told was dead,
p320
aVstumbled into the tent,
p321
aVjust like a mummy, he walked into the tent.
p322
aVI expected him to be incoherent,
p323
aVbut, in fact, he walked into the tent and said to me,
p324
aV"Hi, Ken. Where should I sit?"
p325
aVAnd then he said,
p326
aV"Do you accept my health insurance?"
p327
aV(Laughter)
p328
aVHe really said that.
p329
aV(Laughter)
p330
aVSo he was completely lucid, but he was very severely frostbitten.
p331
aVYou can see his hand is completely white;
p332
aVhis face, his nose, is burned.
p333
aVFirst, it turns white, and then when it's completed necrosis,
p334
aVit turns black, and then it falls off.
p335
aVIt's the last stage, just like a scar.
p336
aa(lp337
VSo, as I was taking care of Beck,
p338
aVhe related what had been going on up there.
p339
aVHe said he had gotten lost in the storm,
p340
aVcollapsed in the snow,
p341
aVand just laid there, unable to move.
p342
aVSome climbers had come by and looked at him,
p343
aVand he heard them say, "He's dead."
p344
aVBut Beck wasn't dead; he heard that,
p345
aVbut he was completely unable to move.
p346
aVHe was in some sort of catatonic state
p347
aVwhere he could be aware of his surroundings,
p348
aVbut couldn't even blink to indicate that he was alive.
p349
aVSo the climbers passed him by,
p350
aVand Beck lay there for a day, a night
p351
aVand another day,
p352
aVin the snow.
p353
aVAnd then he said to himself,
p354
aV"I don't want to die.
p355
aVI have a family to come back to."
p356
aVAnd the thoughts of his family,
p357
aVhis kids and his wife,
p358
aVgenerated enough energy,
p359
aVenough motivation in him,
p360
aVso that he actually got up.
p361
aVAfter laying in the snow that long a time,
p362
aVhe got up and found his way back to the camp.
p363
aVAnd Beck told me that story very quietly,
p364
aVbut I was absolutely stunned by it.
p365
aVI couldn't imagine anybody laying in the snow
p366
aVthat long a time
p367
aVand then getting up.
p368
aVHe apparently reversed
p369
aVan irreversible hypothermia.
p370
aVAnd I can only try to speculate
p371
aVon how he did it.
p372
aa(lp373
VSo, what if we had Beck
p374
aVhooked up to a SPECT scan,
p375
aVsomething that could actually measure brain function?
p376
aVJust very simply, the three parts of the brain:
p377
aVthe frontal lobe, where you focus
p378
aVyour attention and concentration;
p379
aVyou have the temporal lobe,
p380
aVwhere you form images and keep memories;
p381
aVand the posterior part of your brain,
p382
aVwhich contains the cerebellum, which controls motion;
p383
aVand the brain stem,
p384
aVwhere you have your basic maintenance functions,
p385
aVlike heartbeat and respiration.
p386
aa(lp387
VSo let's take a cut through the brain here,
p388
aVand imagine that Beck
p389
aVwas hooked up to a SPECT scan.
p390
aVThis measures dynamic blood flow
p391
aVand therefore energy flow within the brain.
p392
aVSo you have the prefrontal cortex here,
p393
aVlighting up in red.
p394
aVThis is a pretty evenly distributed scan.
p395
aVYou have the middle area,
p396
aVwhere the temporal lobe might be, in here,
p397
aVand the posterior portion, where the maintenance functions are in the back.
p398
aa(lp399
VThis is a roughly normal scan,
p400
aVshowing equal distribution of energy.
p401
aVNow, you go to this one and you see how much more
p402
aVthe frontal lobes are lighting up.
p403
aVThis might be what Beck would be experiencing
p404
aVwhen he realizes he's in danger.
p405
aVHe's focusing all his attention
p406
aVon getting himself out of trouble.
p407
aVThese parts of the brain are quieting down.
p408
aVHe's not thinking about his family or anybody else at this point,
p409
aVand he's working pretty hard.
p410
aVHe's trying to get his muscles going and get out of this.
p411
aVOK, but he's losing ground here.
p412
aVHe's running out of energy.
p413
aVIt's too cold; he can't keep his metabolic fires going,
p414
aVand, you see, there's no more red here;
p415
aVhis brain is quieting down.
p416
aVHe's collapsed in the snow here. Everything is quiet,
p417
aVthere's very little red anywhere.
p418
aVBeck is powering down.
p419
aVHe's dying.
p420
aa(lp421
VYou go on to the next scan,
p422
aVbut, in Beck's case,
p423
aVyou can see that the middle part of his brain
p424
aVis beginning to light up again.
p425
aVHe's beginning to think about his family.
p426
aVHe's beginning to have images
p427
aVthat are motivating him to get up.
p428
aVHe's developing energy in this area
p429
aVthrough thought.
p430
aVAnd this is how he's going to turn thought
p431
aVback into action.
p432
aVThis part of the brain is called the anterior cingulate gyrus.
p433
aVIt's an area in which
p434
aVa lot of neuroscientists believe
p435
aVthe seat of will exists.
p436
aVThis is where people make decisions, where they develop willpower.
p437
aVAnd, you can see, there's an energy flow
p438
aVgoing from the mid portion of his brain,
p439
aVwhere he's got images of his family,
p440
aVinto this area, which is powering his will.
p441
aa(lp442
VOkay. This is getting stronger and stronger
p443
aVto the point where it's actually
p444
aVgoing to be a motivating factor.
p445
aVHe's going to develop enough energy in that area \u2014
p446
aVafter a day, a night and a day \u2014
p447
aVto actually motivate himself to get up.
p448
aVAnd you can see here,
p449
aVhe's starting to get more energy into the frontal lobe.
p450
aVHe's beginning to focus, he can concentrate now.
p451
aVHe's thinking about what he's got to do to save himself.
p452
aVSo this energy has been transmitted
p453
aVup toward the front of his brain,
p454
aVand it's getting quieter down here,
p455
aVbut he's using this energy
p456
aVto think about what he has to do to get himself going.
p457
aVAnd then, that energy is sort of spreading
p458
aVthroughout his thought areas.
p459
aVHe's not thinking about his family now, and he's getting himself motivated.
p460
aVThis is the posterior part, where his muscles are going to be moving,
p461
aVand he's going to be pacing himself.
p462
aVHis heart and lungs are going to pick up speed.
p463
aVSo this is what I can speculate might have been going on
p464
aVhad we been able to do a SPECT scan on Beck
p465
aVduring this survival epic.
p466
aa(lp467
VSo here I am taking care of Beck at 21,000 feet,
p468
aVand I felt what I was doing was completely trivial
p469
aVcompared to what he had done for himself.
p470
aVIt just shows you what the power of the mind can do.
p471
aVHe was critically ill, there were other critically ill patients;
p472
aVluckily, we were able to get a helicopter
p473
aVin to rescue these guys.
p474
aVA helicopter came in at 21,000 feet
p475
aVand carried out the highest helicopter rescue in history.
p476
aVIt was able to land on the ice, take away Beck
p477
aVand the other survivors, one by one,
p478
aVand get them off to Kathmandu in a clinic
p479
aVbefore we even got back to base camp.
p480
aa(lp481
VThis is a scene at base camp,
p482
aVat one of the camps
p483
aVwhere some of the climbers were lost.
p484
aVAnd we had a memorial service there
p485
aVa few days later.
p486
aVThese are Serphas lighting juniper branches.
p487
aVThey believe juniper smoke is holy.
p488
aVAnd the climbers stood around on the high rocks
p489
aVand spoke of the climbers who were lost
p490
aVup near the summit,
p491
aVturning to the mountain, actually, to talk to them directly.
p492
aVThere were five climbers lost here.
p493
aVThis was Scott Fischer,
p494
aVRob Hall,
p495
aVAndy Harris,
p496
aVDoug Hansen
p497
aVand Yasuko Namba.
p498
aVAnd one more climber
p499
aVshould have died that day, but didn't,
p500
aVand that's Beck Weathers.
p501
aVHe was able to survive
p502
aVbecause he was able to generate that incredible willpower,
p503
aVhe was able to use all the power of his mind
p504
aVto save himself.
p505
aa(lp506
VThese are Tibetan prayer flags.
p507
aVThese Sherpas believe that
p508
aVif you write prayers on these flags,
p509
aVthe message will be carried up to the gods,
p510
aVand that year, Beck's message was answered.
p511
aa(lp512
VThank you.
