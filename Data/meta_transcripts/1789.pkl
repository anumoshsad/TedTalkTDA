VWhere do you come from?
p4
aVIt's such a simple question,
p5
aVbut these days, of course, simple questions
p6
aVbring ever more complicated answers.
p7
aa(lp8
VPeople are always asking me where I come from,
p9
aVand they're expecting me to say India,
p10
aVand they're absolutely right insofar as 100 percent
p11
aVof my blood and ancestry does come from India.
p12
aVExcept, I've never lived one day of my life there.
p13
aVI can't speak even one word
p14
aVof its more than 22,000 dialects.
p15
aVSo I don't think I've really earned the right
p16
aVto call myself an Indian.
p17
aVAnd if "Where do you come from?"
p18
aVmeans "Where were you born and raised and educated?"
p19
aVthen I'm entirely of that funny little country
p20
aVknown as England,
p21
aVexcept I left England as soon as I completed
p22
aVmy undergraduate education,
p23
aVand all the time I was growing up,
p24
aVI was the only kid in all my classes
p25
aVwho didn't begin to look like the classic English heroes
p26
aVrepresented in our textbooks.
p27
aVAnd if "Where do you come from?"
p28
aVmeans "Where do you pay your taxes?
p29
aVWhere do you see your doctor and your dentist?"
p30
aVthen I'm very much of the United States,
p31
aVand I have been for 48 years now,
p32
aVsince I was a really small child.
p33
aVExcept, for many of those years,
p34
aVI've had to carry around this funny little pink card
p35
aVwith green lines running through my face
p36
aVidentifying me as a permanent alien.
p37
aVI do actually feel more alien the longer I live there.
p38
aa(lp39
V(Laughter)
p40
aa(lp41
VAnd if "Where do you come from?"
p42
aVmeans "Which place goes deepest inside you
p43
aVand where do you try to spend most of your time?"
p44
aVthen I'm Japanese,
p45
aVbecause I've been living as much as I can
p46
aVfor the last 25 years in Japan.
p47
aVExcept, all of those years I've been there on a tourist visa,
p48
aVand I'm fairly sure not many Japanese
p49
aVwould want to consider me one of them.
p50
aa(lp51
VAnd I say all this just to stress
p52
aVhow very old-fashioned and straightforward
p53
aVmy background is,
p54
aVbecause when I go to Hong Kong or Sydney or Vancouver,
p55
aVmost of the kids I meet
p56
aVare much more international and multi-cultured than I am.
p57
aVAnd they have one home associated with their parents,
p58
aVbut another associated with their partners,
p59
aVa third connected maybe with the place where they happen to be,
p60
aVa fourth connected with the place they dream of being,
p61
aVand many more besides.
p62
aVAnd their whole life will be spent taking pieces
p63
aVof many different places and putting them together
p64
aVinto a stained glass whole.
p65
aVHome for them is really a work in progress.
p66
aVIt's like a project on which they're constantly adding
p67
aVupgrades and improvements and corrections.
p68
aVAnd for more and more of us,
p69
aVhome has really less to do with a piece of soil
p70
aVthan, you could say, with a piece of soul.
p71
aa(lp72
VIf somebody suddenly asks me, "Where's your home?"
p73
aVI think about my sweetheart or my closest friends
p74
aVor the songs that travel with me wherever I happen to be.
p75
aVAnd I'd always felt this way,
p76
aVbut it really came home to me, as it were,
p77
aVsome years ago when I was climbing up the stairs
p78
aVin my parents' house in California,
p79
aVand I looked through the living room windows
p80
aVand I saw that we were encircled by 70-foot flames,
p81
aVone of those wildfires that regularly tear through
p82
aVthe hills of California and many other such places.
p83
aVAnd three hours later, that fire had reduced
p84
aVmy home and every last thing in it
p85
aVexcept for me to ash.
p86
aVAnd when I woke up the next morning,
p87
aVI was sleeping on a friend's floor,
p88
aVthe only thing I had in the world was a toothbrush
p89
aVI had just bought from an all-night supermarket.
p90
aVOf course, if anybody asked me then,
p91
aV"Where is your home?"
p92
aVI literally couldn't point to any physical construction.
p93
aVMy home would have to be whatever I carried around inside me.
p94
aa(lp95
VAnd in so many ways, I think this is a terrific liberation.
p96
aVBecause when my grandparents were born,
p97
aVthey pretty much had their sense of home,
p98
aVtheir sense of community, even their sense of enmity,
p99
aVassigned to them at birth,
p100
aVand didn't have much chance of stepping outside of that.
p101
aVAnd nowadays, at least some of us can choose our sense of home,
p102
aVcreate our sense of community,
p103
aVfashion our sense of self, and in so doing
p104
aVmaybe step a little beyond
p105
aVsome of the black and white divisions
p106
aVof our grandparents' age.
p107
aVNo coincidence that the president
p108
aVof the strongest nation on Earth is half-Kenyan,
p109
aVpartly raised in Indonesia,
p110
aVhas a Chinese-Canadian brother-in-law.
p111
aa(lp112
VThe number of people living in countries not their own
p113
aVnow comes to 220 million,
p114
aVand that's an almost unimaginable number,
p115
aVbut it means that if you took the whole population of Canada
p116
aVand the whole population of Australia
p117
aVand then the whole population of Australia again
p118
aVand the whole population of Canada again
p119
aVand doubled that number,
p120
aVyou would still have fewer people than belong
p121
aVto this great floating tribe.
p122
aa(lp123
VAnd the number of us who live outside
p124
aVthe old nation-state categories is increasing so quickly,
p125
aVby 64 million just in the last 12 years,
p126
aVthat soon there will be more of us than there are Americans.
p127
aVAlready, we represent the fifth-largest nation on Earth.
p128
aVAnd in fact, in Canada's largest city, Toronto,
p129
aVthe average resident today is what used to be called
p130
aVa foreigner, somebody born in a very different country.
p131
aa(lp132
VAnd I've always felt that the beauty of being surrounded by the foreign
p133
aVis that it slaps you awake.
p134
aVYou can't take anything for granted.
p135
aVTravel, for me, is a little bit like being in love,
p136
aVbecause suddenly all your senses are at the setting marked "on."
p137
aVSuddenly you're alert to the secret patterns of the world.
p138
aVThe real voyage of discovery, as Marcel Proust famously said,
p139
aVconsists not in seeing new sights,
p140
aVbut in looking with new eyes.
p141
aVAnd of course, once you have new eyes,
p142
aVeven the old sights, even your home
p143
aVbecome something different.
p144
aVMany of the people living in countries not their own
p145
aVare refugees who never wanted to leave home
p146
aVand ache to go back home.
p147
aVBut for the fortunate among us,
p148
aVI think the age of movement brings exhilarating new possibilities.
p149
aa(lp150
VCertainly when I'm traveling,
p151
aVespecially to the major cities of the world,
p152
aVthe typical person I meet today
p153
aVwill be, let's say, a half-Korean, half-German young woman
p154
aVliving in Paris.
p155
aVAnd as soon as she meets a half-Thai,
p156
aVhalf-Canadian young guy from Edinburgh,
p157
aVshe recognizes him as kin.
p158
aVShe realizes that she probably has much more in common with him
p159
aVthan with anybody entirely of Korea or entirely of Germany.
p160
aVSo they become friends. They fall in love.
p161
aVThey move to New York City.
p162
aa(lp163
V(Laughter)
p164
aa(lp165
VOr Edinburgh.
p166
aVAnd the little girl who arises out of their union
p167
aVwill of course be not Korean or German
p168
aVor French or Thai or Scotch or Canadian
p169
aVor even American, but a wonderful
p170
aVand constantly evolving mix of all those places.
p171
aVAnd potentially, everything about the way
p172
aVthat young woman dreams about the world,
p173
aVwrites about the world, thinks about the world,
p174
aVcould be something different,
p175
aVbecause it comes out of this almost unprecedented
p176
aVblend of cultures.
p177
aa(lp178
VWhere you come from now is much less important
p179
aVthan where you're going.
p180
aVMore and more of us are rooted in the future
p181
aVor the present tense as much as in the past.
p182
aVAnd home, we know, is not just the place
p183
aVwhere you happen to be born.
p184
aVIt's the place where you become yourself.
p185
aa(lp186
VAnd yet,
p187
aVthere is one great problem with movement,
p188
aVand that is that it's really hard to get your bearings
p189
aVwhen you're in midair.
p190
aVSome years ago, I noticed that I had accumulated
p191
aVone million miles on United Airlines alone.
p192
aVYou all know that crazy system,
p193
aVsix days in hell, you get the seventh day free.
p194
aa(lp195
V(Laughter)
p196
aa(lp197
VAnd I began to think that really,
p198
aVmovement was only as good as the sense of stillness
p199
aVthat you could bring to it to put it into perspective.
p200
aa(lp201
VAnd eight months after my house burned down,
p202
aVI ran into a friend who taught at a local high school,
p203
aVand he said, "I've got the perfect place for you."
p204
aV"Really?" I said. I'm always a bit skeptical
p205
aVwhen people say things like that.
p206
aV"No, honestly," he went on,
p207
aV"it's only three hours away by car,
p208
aVand it's not very expensive,
p209
aVand it's probably not like anywhere you've stayed before."
p210
aV"Hmm." I was beginning to get slightly intrigued. "What is it?"
p211
aV"Well \u2014" Here my friend hemmed and hawed \u2014
p212
aV"Well, actually it's a Catholic hermitage."
p213
aVThis was the wrong answer.
p214
aVI had spent 15 years in Anglican schools,
p215
aVso I had had enough hymnals and crosses to last me a lifetime.
p216
aVSeveral lifetimes, actually.
p217
aVBut my friend assured me that he wasn't Catholic,
p218
aVnor were most of his students,
p219
aVbut he took his classes there every spring.
p220
aVAnd as he had it, even the most restless, distractible,
p221
aVtestosterone-addled 15-year-old Californian boy
p222
aVonly had to spend three days in silence
p223
aVand something in him cooled down and cleared out.
p224
aVHe found himself.
p225
aVAnd I thought, "Anything that works for a 15-year-old boy
p226
aVought to work for me."
p227
aa(lp228
VSo I got in my car, and I drove three hours north
p229
aValong the coast,
p230
aVand the roads grew emptier and narrower,
p231
aVand then I turned onto an even narrower path,
p232
aVbarely paved, that snaked for two miles
p233
aVup to the top of a mountain.
p234
aVAnd when I got out of my car,
p235
aVthe air was pulsing.
p236
aVThe whole place was absolutely silent,
p237
aVbut the silence wasn't an absence of noise.
p238
aVIt was really a presence of a kind of energy or quickening.
p239
aVAnd at my feet was the great, still blue plate
p240
aVof the Pacific Ocean.
p241
aVAll around me were 800 acres of wild dry brush.
p242
aa(lp243
VAnd I went down to the room in which I was to be sleeping.
p244
aVSmall but eminently comfortable,
p245
aVit had a bed and a rocking chair
p246
aVand a long desk and even longer picture windows
p247
aVlooking out on a small, private, walled garden,
p248
aVand then 1,200 feet of golden pampas grass
p249
aVrunning down to the sea.
p250
aVAnd I sat down, and I began to write,
p251
aVand write, and write,
p252
aVeven though I'd gone there really to get away from my desk.
p253
aVAnd by the time I got up, four hours had passed.
p254
aVNight had fallen,
p255
aVand I went out under this great overturned saltshaker of stars,
p256
aVand I could see the tail lights of cars
p257
aVdisappearing around the headlands 12 miles to the south.
p258
aVAnd it really seemed like my concerns of the previous day
p259
aVvanishing.
p260
aVAnd the next day, when I woke up
p261
aVin the absence of telephones and TVs and laptops,
p262
aVthe days seemed to stretch for a thousand hours.
p263
aVIt was really all the freedom I know when I'm traveling,
p264
aVbut it also profoundly felt like coming home.
p265
aVAnd I'm not a religious person,
p266
aVso I didn't go to the services.
p267
aVI didn't consult the monks for guidance.
p268
aVI just took walks along the monastery road
p269
aVand sent postcards to loved ones.
p270
aVI looked at the clouds,
p271
aVand I did what is hardest of all for me to do usually,
p272
aVwhich is nothing at all.
p273
aa(lp274
VAnd I started to go back to this place,
p275
aVand I noticed that I was doing my most important work there
p276
aVinvisibly just by sitting still,
p277
aVand certainly coming to my most critical decisions
p278
aVthe way I never could when I was racing
p279
aVfrom the last email to the next appointment.
p280
aVAnd I began to think that something in me
p281
aVhad really been crying out for stillness,
p282
aVbut of course I couldn't hear it
p283
aVbecause I was running around so much.
p284
aVI was like some crazy guy who puts on a blindfold
p285
aVand then complains that he can't see a thing.
p286
aa(lp287
VAnd I thought back to that wonderful phrase
p288
aVI had learned as a boy from Seneca,
p289
aVin which he says, "That man is poor
p290
aVnot who has little but who hankers after more."
p291
aVAnd, of course, I'm not suggesting
p292
aVthat anybody here go into a monastery.
p293
aVThat's not the point.
p294
aVBut I do think it's only by stopping movement
p295
aVthat you can see where to go.
p296
aVAnd it's only by stepping out of your life and the world
p297
aVthat you can see what you most deeply care about
p298
aVand find a home.
p299
aa(lp300
VAnd I've noticed so many people now
p301
aVtake conscious measures to sit quietly for 30 minutes
p302
aVevery morning just collecting themselves
p303
aVin one corner of the room without their devices,
p304
aVor go running every evening,
p305
aVor leave their cell phones behind
p306
aVwhen they go to have a long conversation with a friend.
p307
aVMovement is a fantastic privilege,
p308
aVand it allows us to do so much that our grandparents
p309
aVcould never have dreamed of doing.
p310
aVBut movement, ultimately,
p311
aVonly has a meaning if you have a home to go back to.
p312
aa(lp313
VAnd home, in the end, is of course
p314
aVnot just the place where you sleep.
p315
aVIt's the place where you stand.
p316
aa(lp317
VThank you.
