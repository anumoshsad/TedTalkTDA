VThat's how we traveled in the year 1900.
p4
aVThat's an open buggy. It doesn't have heating.
p5
aVIt doesn't have air conditioning.
p6
aVThat horse is pulling it along
p7
aVat one percent of the speed of sound,
p8
aVand the rutted dirt road
p9
aVturns into a quagmire of mud anytime it rains.
p10
aVThat's a Boeing 707.
p11
aVOnly 60 years later, it travels
p12
aVat 80 percent of the speed of sound,
p13
aVand we don't travel any faster today
p14
aVbecause commercial supersonic air travel
p15
aVturned out to be a bust.
p16
aa(lp17
VSo I started wondering and pondering,
p18
aVcould it be that the best years of American economic growth
p19
aVare behind us?
p20
aVAnd that leads to the suggestion, maybe economic growth
p21
aVis almost over.
p22
aVSome of the reasons for this are not really very controversial.
p23
aVThere are four headwinds that are just hitting
p24
aVthe American economy in the face.
p25
aVThey're demographics, education, debt and inequality.
p26
aVThey're powerful enough to cut growth in half.
p27
aVSo we need a lot of innovation to offset this decline.
p28
aVAnd here's my theme: Because of the headwinds,
p29
aVif innovation continues to be as powerful as it has been
p30
aVin the last 150 years, growth is cut in half.
p31
aVIf innovation is less powerful,
p32
aVinvents less great, wonderful things,
p33
aVthen growth is going to be even lower than half of history.
p34
aa(lp35
VNow here's eight centuries of economic growth.
p36
aVThe vertical axis is just percent per year of growth,
p37
aVzero percent a year, one percent a year, two percent a year.
p38
aVThe white line is for the U.K., and then the U.S.
p39
aVtakes over as the leading nation in the year 1900,
p40
aVwhen the line switches to red.
p41
aVYou'll notice that, for the first four centuries,
p42
aVthere's hardly any growth at all, just 0.2 percent.
p43
aVThen growth gets better and better.
p44
aVIt maxes out in the 1930s, '40s and '50s,
p45
aVand then it starts slowing down, and here's a cautionary note.
p46
aVThat last downward notch in the red line
p47
aVis not actual data.
p48
aVThat is a forecast that I made six years ago
p49
aVthat growth would slow down to 1.3 percent.
p50
aVBut you know what the actual facts are?
p51
aVYou know what the growth in per-person income has been
p52
aVin the United States in the last six years?
p53
aVNegative.
p54
aa(lp55
VThis led to a fantasy.
p56
aVWhat if I try to fit a curved line to this historical record?
p57
aVI can make the curved line end anywhere I wanted,
p58
aVbut I decided I would end it at 0.2,
p59
aVjust like the U.K. growth for the first four centuries.
p60
aVNow the history that we've achieved is that we've grown
p61
aVat 2.0 percent per year over the whole period,
p62
aV1891 to 2007,
p63
aVand remember it's been a little bit negative since 2007.
p64
aVBut if growth slows down,
p65
aVinstead of doubling our standard of living every generation,
p66
aVAmericans in the future can't expect to be twice as well off as their parents,
p67
aVor even a quarter [more well off than] their parents.
p68
aVNow we're going to change and look at the level of per capita income.
p69
aVThe vertical axis now is thousands of dollars in today's prices.
p70
aVYou'll notice that in 1891, over on the left,
p71
aVwe were at about 5,000 dollars.
p72
aVToday we're at about 44,000 dollars of total output
p73
aVper member of the population.
p74
aVNow what if we could achieve that historic
p75
aVtwo-percent growth for the next 70 years?
p76
aVWell, it's a matter of arithmetic.
p77
aVTwo-percent growth quadruples your standard of living in 70 years.
p78
aVThat means we'd go from 44,000 to 180,000.
p79
aVWell, we're not going to do that,
p80
aVand the reason is the headwinds.
p81
aa(lp82
VThe first headwind is demographics.
p83
aVIt's a truism that your standard of living
p84
aVrises faster than productivity, rises faster than output per hour,
p85
aVif hours per person increased.
p86
aVAnd we got that gift back in the '70s and '80s
p87
aVwhen women entered the labor force.
p88
aVBut now it's turned around.
p89
aVNow hours per person are shrinking,
p90
aVfirst because of the retirement of the baby boomers,
p91
aVand second because there's been a very significant
p92
aVdropping out of the labor force of prime age adult males
p93
aVwho are in the bottom half of the educational distribution.
p94
aa(lp95
VThe next headwind is education.
p96
aVWe've got problems all over our educational system
p97
aVdespite Race to the Top.
p98
aVIn college, we've got cost inflation in higher education
p99
aVthat dwarfs cost inflation in medical care.
p100
aVWe have in higher education a trillion dollars of student debt,
p101
aVand our college completion rate
p102
aVis 15 points, 15 percentage points below Canada.
p103
aVWe have a lot of debt.
p104
aVOur economy grew from 2000 to 2007
p105
aVon the back of consumers massively overborrowing.
p106
aVConsumers paying off that debt is one of the main reasons
p107
aVwhy our economic recovery is so sluggish today.
p108
aVAnd everybody of course knows
p109
aVthat the federal government debt is growing
p110
aVas a share of GDP at a very rapid rate,
p111
aVand the only way that's going to stop is some combination
p112
aVof faster growth in taxes or slower growth in entitlements,
p113
aValso called transfer payments.
p114
aVAnd that gets us down from the 1.5,
p115
aVwhere we've reached for education, down to 1.3.
p116
aa(lp117
VAnd then we have inequality.
p118
aVOver the 15 years before the financial crisis,
p119
aVthe growth rate of the bottom 99 percent
p120
aVof the income distribution was half a point slower
p121
aVthan the averages we've been talking about before.
p122
aVAll the rest went to the top one percent.
p123
aVSo that brings us down to 0.8.
p124
aVAnd that 0.8 is the big challenge.
p125
aVAre we going to grow at 0.8?
p126
aVIf so, that's going to require that our inventions
p127
aVare as important as the ones that happened
p128
aVover the last 150 years.
p129
aVSo let's see what some of those inventions were.
p130
aa(lp131
VIf you wanted to read in 1875 at night,
p132
aVyou needed to have an oil or a gas lamp.
p133
aVThey created pollution, they created odors,
p134
aVthey were hard to control, the light was dim,
p135
aVand they were a fire hazard.
p136
aVBy 1929, electric light was everywhere.
p137
aVWe had the vertical city, the invention of the elevator.
p138
aVCentral Manhattan became possible.
p139
aVAnd then, in addition to that, at the same time,
p140
aVhand tools were replaced by massive electric tools
p141
aVand hand-powered electric tools,
p142
aVall achieved by electricity.
p143
aa(lp144
VElectricity was also very helpful in liberating women.
p145
aVWomen, back in the late 19th century,
p146
aVspent two days a week doing the laundry.
p147
aVThey did it on a scrub board.
p148
aVThen they had to hang the clothes out to dry.
p149
aVThen they had to bring them in.
p150
aVThe whole thing took two days out of the seven-day week.
p151
aVAnd then we had the electric washing machine.
p152
aVAnd by 1950, they were everywhere.
p153
aVBut the women still had to shop every day,
p154
aVbut no they didn't, because electricity
p155
aVbrought us the electric refrigerator.
p156
aa(lp157
VBack in the late 19th century, the only source of heat in most homes
p158
aVwas a big fireplace in the kitchen that was used for cooking and heating.
p159
aVThe bedrooms were cold. They were unheated.
p160
aVBut by 1929, certainly by 1950,
p161
aVwe had central heating everywhere.
p162
aa(lp163
VWhat about the internal combustion engine,
p164
aVwhich was invented in 1879?
p165
aVIn America, before the motor vehicle,
p166
aVtransportation depended entirely on the urban horse,
p167
aVwhich dropped, without restraint,
p168
aV25 to 50 pounds of manure on the streets every day
p169
aVtogether with a gallon of urine.
p170
aVThat comes out at five to 10 tons daily
p171
aVper square mile in cities.
p172
aVThose horses also ate up fully one quarter of American agricultural land.
p173
aVThat's the percentage of American agricultural land
p174
aVit took to feed the horses.
p175
aVOf course, when the motor vehicle was invented,
p176
aVand it became almost ubiquitous by 1929,
p177
aVthat agricultural land could be used for human consumption
p178
aVor for export.
p179
aVAnd here's an interesting ratio: Starting from zero in 1900,
p180
aVonly 30 years later, the ratio of motor vehicles to the number of households
p181
aVin the United States reached 90 percent in just 30 years.
p182
aa(lp183
VBack before the turn of the century,
p184
aVwomen had another problem.
p185
aVAll the water for cooking, cleaning and bathing
p186
aVhad to be carried in buckets and pails in from the outside.
p187
aVIt's a historical fact that in 1885,
p188
aVthe average North Carolina housewife
p189
aVwalked 148 miles a year carrying 35 tons of water.
p190
aVBut by 1929, cities around the country
p191
aVhad put in underground water pipes.
p192
aVThey had put in underground sewer pipes,
p193
aVand as a result, one of the great scourges of the late 19th century,
p194
aVwaterborne diseases like cholera, began to disappear.
p195
aVAnd an amazing fact for techno-optimists
p196
aVis that in the first half of the 20th century,
p197
aVthe rate of improvement of life expectancy
p198
aVwas three times faster than it was
p199
aVin the second half of the 19th century.
p200
aa(lp201
VSo it's a truism that things can't be more than 100 percent of themselves.
p202
aVAnd I'll just give you a few examples.
p203
aVWe went from one percent to 90 percent of the speed of sound.
p204
aVElectrification, central heat, ownership of motor cars,
p205
aVthey all went from zero to 100 percent.
p206
aVUrban environments make people more productive than on the farm.
p207
aVWe went from 25 percent urban to 75 percent
p208
aVby the early postwar years.
p209
aa(lp210
VWhat about the electronic revolution?
p211
aVHere's an early computer.
p212
aVIt's amazing. The mainframe computer was invented in 1942.
p213
aVBy 1960 we had telephone bills, bank statements
p214
aVwere being produced by computers.
p215
aVThe earliest cell phones, the earliest personal computers
p216
aVwere invented in the 1970s.
p217
aVThe 1980s brought us Bill Gates, DOS,
p218
aVATM machines to replace bank tellers,
p219
aVbar code scanning to cut down on labor in the retail sector.
p220
aVFast forward through the '90s,
p221
aVwe had the dotcom revolution
p222
aVand a temporary rise in productivity growth.
p223
aa(lp224
VBut I'm now going to give you an experiment.
p225
aVYou have to choose either option A or option B.
p226
aV(Laughter)
p227
aVOption A is you get to keep everything invented up till 10 years ago.
p228
aVSo you get Google, you get Amazon,
p229
aVyou get Wikipedia, and you get running water and indoor toilets.
p230
aVOr you get everything invented to yesterday,
p231
aVincluding Facebook and your iPhone,
p232
aVbut you have to give up, go out to the outhouse,
p233
aVand carry in the water.
p234
aVHurricane Sandy caused a lot of people to lose the 20th century,
p235
aVmaybe for a couple of days,
p236
aVin some cases for more than a week,
p237
aVelectricity, running water, heating, gasoline for their cars,
p238
aVand a charge for their iPhones.
p239
aa(lp240
VThe problem we face is that all these great inventions,
p241
aVwe have to match them in the future,
p242
aVand my prediction that we're not going to match them
p243
aVbrings us down from the original two-percent growth
p244
aVdown to 0.2, the fanciful curve that I drew you at the beginning.
p245
aa(lp246
VSo here we are back to the horse and buggy.
p247
aVI'd like to award an Oscar
p248
aVto the inventors of the 20th century,
p249
aVthe people from Alexander Graham Bell
p250
aVto Thomas Edison to the Wright Brothers,
p251
aVI'd like to call them all up here,
p252
aVand they're going to call back to you.
p253
aVYour challenge is, can you match what we achieved?
p254
aa(lp255
VThank you.
