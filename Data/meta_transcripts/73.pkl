VWhat I'd like to start off with is an observation,
p4
aVwhich is that if I've learned anything over the last year,
p5
aVit's that the supreme irony
p6
aVof publishing a book about slowness
p7
aVis that you have to go around promoting it really fast.
p8
aVI seem to spend most of my time these days
p9
aVzipping from city to city, studio to studio,
p10
aVinterview to interview,
p11
aVserving up the book in really tiny bite-size chunks.
p12
aVBecause everyone these days
p13
aVwants to know how to slow down,
p14
aVbut they want to know how to slow down really quickly. So ...
p15
aVso I did a spot on CNN the other day
p16
aVwhere I actually spent more time in makeup than I did talking on air.
p17
aVAnd I think that \u2014 that's not really surprising though, is it?
p18
aVBecause that's kind of the world that we live in now,
p19
aVa world stuck in fast-forward.
p20
aa(lp21
VA world obsessed with speed,
p22
aVwith doing everything faster, with cramming more and more
p23
aVinto less and less time.
p24
aVEvery moment of the day feels like
p25
aVa race against the clock.
p26
aVTo borrow a phrase from Carrie Fisher, which is
p27
aVin my bio there; I'll just toss it out again \u2014
p28
aV"These days even instant gratification takes too long." (Laughter)
p29
aVAnd
p30
aVif you think about how we to try to make things better, what do we do?
p31
aVNo, we speed them up, don't we? So we used to dial; now we speed dial.
p32
aVWe used to read; now we speed read. We used to walk; now we speed walk.
p33
aVAnd of course, we used to date and now we speed date.
p34
aVAnd even things that are by their very nature slow \u2014
p35
aVwe try and speed them up too.
p36
aVSo I was in New York recently, and I walked past a gym
p37
aVthat had an advertisement in the window for a new course, a new evening course.
p38
aVAnd it was for, you guessed it, speed yoga.
p39
aVSo this \u2014 the perfect solution for time-starved professionals
p40
aVwho want to, you know, salute the sun,
p41
aVbut only want to give over about 20 minutes to it.
p42
aVI mean, these are sort of the extreme examples,
p43
aVand they're amusing and good to laugh at.
p44
aa(lp45
VBut there's a very serious point,
p46
aVand I think that in the headlong dash of daily life,
p47
aVwe often lose sight of the damage
p48
aVthat this roadrunner form of living does to us.
p49
aVWe're so marinated in the culture of speed
p50
aVthat we almost fail to notice the toll it takes
p51
aVon every aspect of our lives \u2014
p52
aVon our health, our diet, our work,
p53
aVour relationships, the environment and our community.
p54
aVAnd sometimes it takes
p55
aVa wake-up call, doesn't it,
p56
aVto alert us to the fact that we're hurrying through our lives,
p57
aVinstead of actually living them; that we're
p58
aVliving the fast life, instead of the good life.
p59
aVAnd I think for many people, that wake-up call
p60
aVtakes the form of an illness.
p61
aVYou know, a burnout, or eventually the body says,
p62
aV"I can't take it anymore," and throws in the towel.
p63
aVOr maybe a relationship goes up in smoke
p64
aVbecause we haven't had the time, or the patience,
p65
aVor the tranquility,
p66
aVto be with the other person, to listen to them.
p67
aa(lp68
VAnd my wake-up call came when I started
p69
aVreading bedtime stories to my son,
p70
aVand I found that at the end of day,
p71
aVI would go into his room and I just couldn't slow down \u2014 you know,
p72
aVI'd be speed reading "The Cat In The Hat."
p73
aVI'd be \u2014 you know, I'd be skipping lines here,
p74
aVparagraphs there, sometimes a whole page,
p75
aVand of course, my little boy knew the book inside out, so we would quarrel.
p76
aVAnd what should have been the most relaxing, the most intimate,
p77
aVthe most tender moment of the day,
p78
aVwhen a dad sits down to read to his son,
p79
aVbecame instead this kind of gladiatorial battle of wills,
p80
aVa clash between my speed
p81
aVand his slowness.
p82
aVAnd this went on for some time,
p83
aVuntil I caught myself scanning a newspaper article
p84
aVwith timesaving tips for fast people.
p85
aVAnd one of them made reference to a series of books called
p86
aV"The One-Minute Bedtime Story."
p87
aVAnd I wince saying those words now,
p88
aVbut my first reaction at the time was very different.
p89
aVMy first reflex was to say,
p90
aV"Hallelujah \u2014 what a great idea!
p91
aVThis is exactly what I'm looking for to speed up bedtime even more."
p92
aVBut thankfully,
p93
aVa light bulb went on over my head, and my next reaction was very different,
p94
aVand I took a step back, and I thought,
p95
aV"Whoa \u2014 you know, has it really come to this?
p96
aVAm I really in such a hurry that I'm prepared
p97
aVto fob off my son with a sound byte at the end of the day?"
p98
aVAnd I put away the newspaper \u2014
p99
aVand I was getting on a plane \u2014 and I sat there,
p100
aVand I did something I hadn't done for a long time \u2014 which is I did nothing.
p101
aVI just thought, and I thought long and hard.
p102
aVAnd by the time I got off that plane, I'd decided I wanted to do something about it.
p103
aVI wanted to investigate this whole roadrunner culture,
p104
aVand what it was doing to me and to everyone else.
p105
aa(lp106
VAnd I had two questions in my head.
p107
aVThe first was, how did we get so fast?
p108
aVAnd the second is, is it possible,
p109
aVor even desirable, to slow down?
p110
aVNow, if you think about
p111
aVhow our world got so accelerated, the usual suspects rear their heads.
p112
aVYou think of, you know, urbanization,
p113
aVconsumerism, the workplace, technology.
p114
aVBut I think if you cut through
p115
aVthose forces, you get to what might be the deeper
p116
aVdriver, the nub of the question,
p117
aVwhich is how we think about time itself.
p118
aVIn other cultures, time is cyclical.
p119
aVIt's seen as moving in great,
p120
aVunhurried circles.
p121
aVIt's always renewing and refreshing itself.
p122
aVWhereas in the West, time is linear.
p123
aVIt's a finite resource;
p124
aVit's always draining away.
p125
aVYou either use it, or lose it.
p126
aV"Time is money," as Benjamin Franklin said.
p127
aVAnd I think what that does to us psychologically
p128
aVis it creates an equation.
p129
aVTime is scarce, so what do we do?
p130
aVWell \u2014 well, we speed up, don't we?
p131
aVWe try and do more and more with less and less time.
p132
aVWe turn every moment of every day
p133
aVinto a race to the finish line \u2014
p134
aVa finish line, incidentally, that we never reach,
p135
aVbut a finish line nonetheless.
p136
aVAnd I guess that the question is,
p137
aVis it possible to break free from that mindset?
p138
aVAnd thankfully, the answer is yes, because
p139
aVwhat I discovered, when I began looking around, that there is
p140
aVa global backlash against this culture that
p141
aVtells us that faster is always better, and that busier is best.
p142
aa(lp143
VRight across the world, people are doing the unthinkable:
p144
aVthey're slowing down, and finding that,
p145
aValthough conventional wisdom tells you that if you slow down, you're road kill,
p146
aVthe opposite turns out to be true:
p147
aVthat by slowing down at the right moments,
p148
aVpeople find that they do everything better.
p149
aVThey eat better; they make love better; they exercise better;
p150
aVthey work better; they live better.
p151
aVAnd, in this kind of cauldron
p152
aVof moments and places and acts of deceleration,
p153
aVlie what a lot of people now refer to as
p154
aVthe "International Slow Movement."
p155
aa(lp156
VNow if you'll permit me a small act of hypocrisy,
p157
aVI'll just give you a very quick overview of
p158
aVwhat's going on inside the Slow Movement. If you think of food,
p159
aVmany of you will have heard of the Slow Food movement.
p160
aVStarted in Italy, but has spread across the world,
p161
aVand now has 100,000 members
p162
aVin 50 countries.
p163
aVAnd it's driven by a very simple and sensible message,
p164
aVwhich is that we get more pleasure and more health
p165
aVfrom our food when we
p166
aVcultivate, cook and consume it at a reasonable pace.
p167
aVI think also the explosion of
p168
aVthe organic farming movement, and the renaissance of farmers' markets,
p169
aVare other illustrations
p170
aVof the fact that people are desperate to get away from
p171
aVeating and cooking and cultivating their food
p172
aVon an industrial timetable.
p173
aVThey want to get back to slower rhythms.
p174
aVAnd out of the Slow Food movement has grown something
p175
aVcalled the Slow Cities movement, which has started in Italy,
p176
aVbut has spread right across Europe and beyond.
p177
aVAnd in this, towns
p178
aVbegin to rethink how they organize the urban landscape,
p179
aVso that people are encouraged to slow down
p180
aVand smell the roses and connect with one another.
p181
aVSo they might curb traffic,
p182
aVor put in a park bench, or some green space.
p183
aa(lp184
VAnd in some ways, these changes add up to more than the sum of their parts,
p185
aVbecause I think when a Slow City becomes officially a Slow City,
p186
aVit's kind of like a philosophical declaration.
p187
aVIt's saying to the rest of world, and to the people in that town,
p188
aVthat we believe that in the 21st century,
p189
aVslowness has a role to play.
p190
aVIn medicine, I think a lot of people are deeply disillusioned
p191
aVwith the kind of quick-fix mentality
p192
aVyou find in conventional medicine.
p193
aVAnd millions of them around the world are turning
p194
aVto complementary and alternative forms of medicine,
p195
aVwhich tend to tap into sort of
p196
aVslower, gentler, more holistic forms of healing.
p197
aVNow, obviously the jury is out on many of these complementary therapies,
p198
aVand I personally doubt that the coffee enema
p199
aVwill ever, you know, gain mainstream approval.
p200
aVBut other treatments
p201
aVsuch as acupuncture and massage, and even just relaxation,
p202
aVclearly have some kind of benefit.
p203
aVAnd blue-chip medical colleges everywhere
p204
aVare starting to study these things to find out how they work,
p205
aVand what we might learn from them.
p206
aa(lp207
VSex. There's an awful lot of fast sex around, isn't there?
p208
aVI was coming to \u2014
p209
aVwell \u2014 no pun intended there.
p210
aVI was making my way, let's say, slowly to Oxford,
p211
aVand I went through a news agent, and I saw a magazine,
p212
aVa men's magazine, and it said on the front,
p213
aV"How to bring your partner to orgasm in 30 seconds."
p214
aVSo, you know, even sex
p215
aVis on a stopwatch these days.
p216
aVNow, you know,
p217
aVI like a quickie as much as the next person,
p218
aVbut I think that there's an awful lot to be gained
p219
aVfrom slow sex \u2014 from slowing down in the bedroom.
p220
aVYou know, you tap into that \u2014 those deeper,
p221
aVsort of, psychological, emotional, spiritual currents,
p222
aVand you get a better orgasm with the buildup.
p223
aVYou can get more bang for your buck, let's say.
p224
aVI mean, the Pointer Sisters said it most eloquently, didn't they,
p225
aVwhen they sang the praises of "a lover with a slow hand."
p226
aVNow, we all laughed at Sting
p227
aVa few years ago when he went Tantric,
p228
aVbut you fast-forward a few years, and now you find couples of all ages
p229
aVflocking to workshops, or maybe just
p230
aVon their own in their own bedrooms, finding ways
p231
aVto put on the brakes and have better sex.
p232
aVAnd of course, in Italy where \u2014 I mean, Italians always seem to know
p233
aVwhere to find their pleasure \u2014
p234
aVthey've launched an official Slow Sex movement.
p235
aa(lp236
VThe workplace.
p237
aVRight across much of the world \u2014
p238
aVNorth America being a notable exception \u2014
p239
aVworking hours have been coming down.
p240
aVAnd Europe is an example of that,
p241
aVand people finding that their quality of life improves
p242
aVas they're working less, and also
p243
aVthat their hourly productivity goes up.
p244
aVNow, clearly there are problems with
p245
aVthe 35-hour workweek in France \u2014
p246
aVtoo much, too soon, too rigid.
p247
aVBut other countries in Europe, notably the Nordic countries,
p248
aVare showing that it's possible
p249
aVto have a kick-ass economy
p250
aVwithout being a workaholic.
p251
aVAnd Norway, Sweden,
p252
aVDenmark and Finland now rank
p253
aVamong the top six most competitive nations on Earth,
p254
aVand they work the kind of hours that would make the average American
p255
aVweep with envy.
p256
aVAnd if you go beyond sort of the country level,
p257
aVdown at the micro-company level,
p258
aVmore and more companies now are realizing
p259
aVthat they need to allow their staff
p260
aVeither to work fewer hours or just to unplug \u2014
p261
aVto take a lunch break, or to go sit in a quiet room,
p262
aVto switch off their Blackberrys and laptops \u2014 you at the back \u2014
p263
aVmobile phones,
p264
aVduring the work day or on the weekend, so that they have time to recharge
p265
aVand for the brain to slide into that
p266
aVkind of creative mode of thought.
p267
aa(lp268
VIt's not just, though, these days,
p269
aVadults who overwork, though, is it? It's children, too.
p270
aVI'm 37, and my childhood ended in the mid-'80s,
p271
aVand I look at kids now, and I'm just amazed by the way they
p272
aVrace around with more homework,
p273
aVmore tutoring, more extracurriculars
p274
aVthan we would ever have conceived of a generation ago.
p275
aVAnd some of the most heartrending emails
p276
aVthat I get on my website
p277
aVare actually from adolescents
p278
aVhovering on the edge of burnout, pleading with me
p279
aVto write to their parents,
p280
aVto help them slow down, to help them get off this
p281
aVfull-throttle treadmill.
p282
aVBut thankfully, there is a backlash there in parenting as well,
p283
aVand you're finding that, you know, towns in the United States
p284
aVare now banding together and banning extracurriculars
p285
aVon a particular day of the month, so that people can,
p286
aVyou know, decompress and have some family time, and slow down.
p287
aa(lp288
VHomework is another thing. There are homework bans
p289
aVspringing up all over the developed world
p290
aVin schools which had been piling on the homework for years,
p291
aVand now they're discovering that less can be more.
p292
aVSo there was a case up in Scotland recently
p293
aVwhere a fee-paying, high-achieving private school
p294
aVbanned homework
p295
aVfor everyone under the age of 13,
p296
aVand the high-achieving parents freaked out and said,
p297
aV"What are you \u2014 you know, our kids will fall" \u2014 the headmaster said,
p298
aV"No, no, your children need to slow down at the end of the day."
p299
aVAnd just this last month, the exam results came in,
p300
aVand in math, science, marks went up 20 percent
p301
aVon average last year.
p302
aVAnd I think what's very revealing is that
p303
aVthe elite universities, who are often cited as the reason
p304
aVthat people drive their kids and hothouse them so much,
p305
aVare starting to notice the caliber of students
p306
aVcoming to them is falling. These kids have wonderful marks;
p307
aVthey have CVs jammed with extracurriculars,
p308
aVto the point that would make your eyes water.
p309
aVBut they lack spark; they lack
p310
aVthe ability to think creatively and think outside \u2014
p311
aVthey don't know how to dream. And so what these Ivy League schools,
p312
aVand Oxford and Cambridge and so on, are starting to send a message
p313
aVto parents and students that they need to put on the brakes a little bit.
p314
aVAnd in Harvard, for instance, they send out
p315
aVa letter to undergraduates \u2014 freshmen \u2014
p316
aVtelling them that they'll get more out of life, and more out of Harvard,
p317
aVif they put on the brakes, if they do less,
p318
aVbut give time to things, the time that things need,
p319
aVto enjoy them, to savor them.
p320
aVAnd even if they sometimes do nothing at all.
p321
aVAnd that letter is called \u2014 very revealing, I think \u2014
p322
aV"Slow Down!" \u2014 with an exclamation mark on the end.
p323
aa(lp324
VSo wherever you look, the message, it seems to me, is the same:
p325
aVthat less is very often more,
p326
aVthat slower is very often
p327
aVbetter. But that said, of course,
p328
aVit's not that easy to slow down, is it?
p329
aVI mean, you heard that I got a speeding ticket
p330
aVwhile I was researching my book on the benefits of slowness,
p331
aVand that's true, but that's not all of it.
p332
aVI was actually en route to a dinner
p333
aVheld by Slow Food at the time.
p334
aVAnd if that's not shaming enough, I got that ticket in Italy.
p335
aVAnd if any of you have ever driven on an Italian highway,
p336
aVyou'll have a pretty good idea of how fast I was going.
p337
aa(lp338
V(Laughter)
p339
aa(lp340
VBut why is it so hard to slow down?
p341
aVI think there are various reasons.
p342
aVOne is that speed is fun, you know, speed is sexy.
p343
aVIt's all that adrenaline rush. It's hard to give it up.
p344
aVI think there's a kind of metaphysical dimension \u2014
p345
aVthat speed becomes a way of walling ourselves off
p346
aVfrom the bigger, deeper questions.
p347
aVWe fill our head with distraction, with busyness,
p348
aVso that we don't have to ask,
p349
aVam I well? Am I happy? Are my children growing up right?
p350
aVAre politicians making good decisions on my behalf?
p351
aVAnother reason \u2014 although I think, perhaps, the most powerful reason \u2014
p352
aVwhy we find it hard to slow down is the cultural taboo
p353
aVthat we've erected against slowing down.
p354
aV"Slow" is a dirty word in our culture.
p355
aVIt's a byword for "lazy," "slacker,"
p356
aVfor being somebody who gives up.
p357
aVYou know, "he's a bit slow." It's actually synonymous
p358
aVwith being stupid.
p359
aa(lp360
VI guess what the Slow Movement \u2014 the purpose of the Slow Movement,
p361
aVor its main goal, really, is to tackle that taboo,
p362
aVand to say that yes,
p363
aVsometimes slow is not the answer,
p364
aVthat there is such a thing as "bad slow."
p365
aVYou know, I got stuck on the M25,
p366
aVwhich is a ring road around London, recently,
p367
aVand spent three-and-a-half hours there. And I can tell you,
p368
aVthat's really bad slow.
p369
aVBut the new idea,
p370
aVthe sort of revolutionary idea, of the Slow Movement,
p371
aVis that there is such a thing as "good slow," too.
p372
aVAnd good slow is, you know, taking the time
p373
aVto eat a meal with your family, with the TV switched off.
p374
aVOr taking the time to look at a problem from all angles
p375
aVin the office to make the best decision
p376
aVat work.
p377
aVOr even simply just taking the time
p378
aVto slow down
p379
aVand savor your life.
p380
aa(lp381
VNow, one of the things that I found most uplifting
p382
aVabout all of this stuff that's happened around the book
p383
aVsince it came out, is the reaction to it.
p384
aVAnd I knew that when my book on slowness came out,
p385
aVit would be welcomed by the New Age brigade,
p386
aVbut it's also been taken up, with great gusto,
p387
aVby the corporate world \u2014 you know,
p388
aVbusiness press, but also
p389
aVbig companies and leadership organizations.
p390
aVBecause people at the top of the chain, people like you, I think,
p391
aVare starting to realize that there's too much
p392
aVspeed in the system,
p393
aVthere's too much busyness, and it's time to find,
p394
aVor get back to that lost art of shifting gears.
p395
aVAnother encouraging sign, I think,
p396
aVis that it's not just in the developed world
p397
aVthat this idea's been taken up. In the developing world,
p398
aVin countries that are on the verge of making that leap
p399
aVinto first world status \u2014 China, Brazil,
p400
aVThailand, Poland, and so on \u2014
p401
aVthese countries have embraced the idea of the Slow Movement,
p402
aVmany people in them, and there's a debate going on
p403
aVin their media, on the streets.
p404
aVBecause I think they're looking at the West, and they're saying,
p405
aV"Well, we like that aspect of what you've got,
p406
aVbut we're not so sure about that."
p407
aa(lp408
VSo all of that said, is it,
p409
aVI guess, is it possible?
p410
aVThat's really the main question before us today. Is it possible
p411
aVto slow down? And
p412
aVI'm happy to be able to say to you
p413
aVthat the answer is a resounding yes.
p414
aVAnd I present myself as Exhibit A,
p415
aVa kind of reformed and rehabilitated
p416
aVspeed-aholic.
p417
aVI still love speed. You know, I live in London,
p418
aVand I work as a journalist,
p419
aVand I enjoy the buzz and the busyness,
p420
aVand the adrenaline rush that comes from both of those things.
p421
aVI play squash and ice hockey,
p422
aVtwo very fast sports, and I wouldn't give them up for the world.
p423
aVBut I've also, over the last year or so,
p424
aVgot in touch with my inner tortoise.
p425
aa(lp426
V(Laughter)
p427
aa(lp428
VAnd what that means is that
p429
aVI no longer
p430
aVoverload myself gratuitously.
p431
aVMy default mode is no longer
p432
aVto be a rush-aholic.
p433
aVI no longer hear
p434
aVtime's winged chariot drawing near,
p435
aVor at least not as much as I did before.
p436
aVI can actually hear it now, because I see my time is ticking off.
p437
aVAnd the upshot of all of that is that
p438
aVI actually feel a lot happier, healthier,
p439
aVmore productive than I ever have.
p440
aVI feel like I'm living
p441
aVmy life rather than actually just racing through it.
p442
aVAnd perhaps, the most important
p443
aVmeasure of the success of this
p444
aVis that I feel that my relationships are a lot deeper,
p445
aVricher, stronger.
p446
aa(lp447
VAnd for me, I guess, the litmus test
p448
aVfor whether this would work, and what it would mean,
p449
aVwas always going to be bedtime stories, because that's sort of where
p450
aVthe journey began. And there too the news is
p451
aVrosy. You know,
p452
aVat the end of the day, I go into my son's room.
p453
aVI don't wear a watch. I switch off my computer,
p454
aVso I can't hear the email pinging into the basket,
p455
aVand I just slow down to his pace and we read.
p456
aVAnd because children have their own tempo and internal clock,
p457
aVthey don't do quality time,
p458
aVwhere you schedule 10 minutes for them to open up to you.
p459
aVThey need you to move at their rhythm.
p460
aVI find that 10 minutes into a story, you know,
p461
aVmy son will suddenly say, "You know,
p462
aVsomething happened in the playground today that really bothered me."
p463
aVAnd we'll go off and have a conversation on that.
p464
aVAnd I now find that bedtime stories
p465
aVused to be
p466
aVa box on my to-do list, something that I dreaded,
p467
aVbecause it was so slow and I had to get through it quickly.
p468
aVIt's become my reward at the end of the day,
p469
aVsomething I really cherish.
p470
aVAnd I have a kind of Hollywood ending
p471
aVto my talk this afternoon,
p472
aVwhich goes a little bit like this:
p473
aa(lp474
Va few months ago, I was getting ready to go on
p475
aVanother book tour, and I had my bags packed.
p476
aVI was downstairs by the front door, and I was waiting for a taxi,
p477
aVand my son came down the stairs and
p478
aVhe'd made a card for me. And he was carrying it.
p479
aVHe'd gone and stapled two cards, very like these, together,
p480
aVand put a sticker of his favorite
p481
aVcharacter, Tintin, on the front.
p482
aVAnd he said to me,
p483
aVor he handed this to me, and I read it,
p484
aVand it said, "To Daddy, love Benjamin."
p485
aVAnd I thought, "Aw, that's really sweet.
p486
aVIs that a good luck on the book tour card?"
p487
aVAnd he said, "No, no, no, Daddy \u2014 this is a card
p488
aVfor being the best story reader in the world."
p489
aVAnd I thought, "Yeah, you know, this slowing down thing really does work."
p490
