VI live and work from Tokyo, Japan.
p4
aVAnd I specialize in human behavioral research,
p5
aVand applying what we learn to think about the future in different ways,
p6
aVand to design for that future.
p7
aVAnd you know, to be honest, I've been doing this for seven years,
p8
aVand I haven't got a clue what the future is going to be like.
p9
aVBut I've got a pretty good idea
p10
aVhow people will behave when they get there.
p11
aa(lp12
VThis is my office. It's out there.
p13
aVIt's not in the lab,
p14
aVand it's increasingly in places like India, China, Brazil, Africa.
p15
aVWe live on a planet \u2014 6.3 billion people.
p16
aVAbout three billion people, by the end of this year,
p17
aVwill have cellular connectivity.
p18
aVAnd it'll take about another two years to connect the next billion after that.
p19
aVAnd I mention this because,
p20
aVif we want to design for that future,
p21
aVwe need to figure out what those people are about.
p22
aVAnd that's, kind of, where I see what my job is
p23
aVand what our team's job is.
p24
aa(lp25
VOur research often starts with a very simple question.
p26
aVSo I'll give you an example. What do you carry?
p27
aVIf you think of everything in your life that you own,
p28
aVwhen you walk out that door,
p29
aVwhat do you consider to take with you?
p30
aVWhen you're looking around, what do you consider?
p31
aVOf that stuff, what do you carry?
p32
aVAnd of that stuff, what do you actually use?
p33
aa(lp34
VSo this is interesting to us,
p35
aVbecause the conscious and subconscious decision process
p36
aVimplies that the stuff that you do take with you and end up using
p37
aVhas some kind of spiritual, emotional or functional value.
p38
aVAnd to put it really bluntly, you know,
p39
aVpeople are willing to pay for stuff that has value, right?
p40
aVSo I've probably done about five years' research
p41
aVlooking at what people carry.
p42
aVI go in people's bags. I look in people's pockets, purses.
p43
aVI go in their homes. And we do this worldwide,
p44
aVand we follow them around town with video cameras.
p45
aVIt's kind of like stalking with permission.
p46
aVAnd we do all this \u2014 and to go back to the original question,
p47
aVwhat do people carry?
p48
aa(lp49
VAnd it turns out that people carry a lot of stuff.
p50
aVOK, that's fair enough.
p51
aVBut if you ask people what the three most important things that they carry are \u2014
p52
aVacross cultures and across gender and across contexts \u2014
p53
aVmost people will say keys, money
p54
aVand, if they own one, a mobile phone.
p55
aVAnd I'm not saying this is a good thing, but this is a thing, right?
p56
aVI mean, I couldn't take your phones off you if I wanted to.
p57
aVYou'd probably kick me out, or something.
p58
aVOK, it might seem like an obvious thing
p59
aVfor someone who works for a mobile phone company to ask.
p60
aVBut really, the question is, why? Right?
p61
aVSo why are these things so important in our lives?
p62
aVAnd it turns out, from our research, that it boils down to survival \u2014
p63
aVsurvival for us and survival for our loved ones.
p64
aa(lp65
VSo, keys provide an access to shelter and warmth \u2014
p66
aVtransport as well, in the U.S. increasingly.
p67
aVMoney is useful for buying food, sustenance,
p68
aVamong all its other uses.
p69
aVAnd a mobile phone, it turns out, is a great recovery tool.
p70
aVIf you prefer this kind of Maslow's hierarchy of needs,
p71
aVthose three objects are very good at supporting
p72
aVthe lowest rungs in Maslow's hierarchy of needs.
p73
aVYes, they do a whole bunch of other stuff,
p74
aVbut they're very good at this.
p75
aVAnd in particular, it's the mobile phone's ability
p76
aVto allow people to transcend space and time.
p77
aVAnd what I mean by that is, you know,
p78
aVyou can transcend space by simply making a voice call, right?
p79
aVAnd you can transcend time by sending a message at your convenience,
p80
aVand someone else can pick it up at their convenience.
p81
aVAnd this is fairly universally appreciated, it turns out,
p82
aVwhich is why we have three billion plus people who have been connected.
p83
aVAnd they value that connectivity.
p84
aa(lp85
VBut actually, you can do this kind of stuff with PCs.
p86
aVAnd you can do them with phone kiosks.
p87
aVAnd the mobile phone, in addition, is both personal \u2014
p88
aVand so it also gives you a degree of privacy \u2014 and it's convenient.
p89
aVYou don't need to ask permission from anyone,
p90
aVyou can just go ahead and do it, right?
p91
aVHowever, for these things to help us survive,
p92
aVit depends on them being carried.
p93
aVBut \u2014 and it's a pretty big but \u2014 we forget.
p94
aVWe're human, that's what we do. It's one of our features.
p95
aVI think, quite a nice feature.
p96
aVSo we forget, but we're also adaptable,
p97
aVand we adapt to situations around us pretty well.
p98
aVAnd so we have these strategies to remember,
p99
aVand one of them was mentioned yesterday.
p100
aVAnd it's, quite simply, the point of reflection.
p101
aVAnd that's that moment when you're walking out of a space,
p102
aVand you turn around, and quite often you tap your pockets.
p103
aVEven women who keep stuff in their bags tap their pockets.
p104
aVAnd you turn around, and you look back into the space,
p105
aVand some people talk aloud.
p106
aVAnd pretty much everyone does it at some point.
p107
aa(lp108
VOK, the next thing is \u2014 most of you, if you have a stable home life,
p109
aVand what I mean is that you don't travel all the time, and always in hotels,
p110
aVbut most people have what we call a center of gravity.
p111
aVAnd a center of gravity is where you keep these objects.
p112
aVAnd these things don't stay in the center of gravity,
p113
aVbut over time, they gravitate there.
p114
aVIt's where you expect to find stuff.
p115
aVAnd in fact, when you're turning around,
p116
aVand you're looking inside the house,
p117
aVand you're looking for this stuff,
p118
aVthis is where you look first, right?
p119
aVOK, so when we did this research,
p120
aVwe found the absolutely, 100 percent, guaranteed way
p121
aVto never forget anything ever, ever again.
p122
aVAnd that is, quite simply, to have nothing to remember.
p123
aV(Laughter)
p124
aa(lp125
VOK, now, that sounds like something you get on a Chinese fortune cookie, right?
p126
aVBut is, in fact, about the art of delegation.
p127
aVAnd from a design perspective,
p128
aVit's about understanding what you can delegate to technology
p129
aVand what you can delegate to other people.
p130
aVAnd it turns out, delegation \u2014 if you want it to be \u2014
p131
aVcan be the solution for pretty much everything,
p132
aVapart from things like bodily functions, going to the toilet.
p133
aVYou can't ask someone to do that on your behalf.
p134
aVAnd apart from things like entertainment,
p135
aVyou wouldn't pay for someone to go to the cinema for you and have fun on your behalf,
p136
aVor, at least, not yet.
p137
aVMaybe sometime in the future, we will.
p138
aa(lp139
VSo, let me give you an example of delegation in practice, right.
p140
aVSo this is \u2014 probably the thing I'm most passionate about
p141
aVis the research that we've been doing on illiteracy
p142
aVand how people who are illiterate communicate.
p143
aVSo, the U.N. estimated \u2014 this is 2004 figures \u2014
p144
aVthat there are almost 800 million people who can't read and write, worldwide.
p145
aVSo, we've been conducting a lot of research.
p146
aVAnd one of the things we were looking at is \u2014
p147
aVif you can't read and write,
p148
aVif you want to communicate over distances,
p149
aVyou need to be able to identify the person
p150
aVthat you want to communicate with.
p151
aVIt could be a phone number, it could be an e-mail address,
p152
aVit could be a postal address.
p153
aVSimple question: if you can't read and write,
p154
aVhow do you manage your contact information?
p155
aa(lp156
VAnd the fact is that millions of people do it.
p157
aVJust from a design perspective, we didn't really understand how they did it,
p158
aVand so that's just one small example
p159
aVof the kind of research that we were doing.
p160
aVAnd it turns out that illiterate people are masters of delegation.
p161
aVSo they delegate that part of the task process to other people,
p162
aVthe stuff that they can't do themselves.
p163
aVLet me give you another example of delegation.
p164
aVThis one's a little bit more sophisticated,
p165
aVand this is from a study that we did in Uganda
p166
aVabout how people who are sharing devices, use those devices.
p167
aVSente is a word in Uganda that means money.
p168
aVIt has a second meaning, which is to send money as airtime. OK?
p169
aa(lp170
VAnd it works like this.
p171
aVSo let's say, June, you're in a village, rural village.
p172
aVI'm in Kampala and I'm the wage earner.
p173
aVI'm sending money back, and it works like this.
p174
aVSo, in your village, there's one person in the village with a phone,
p175
aVand that's the phone kiosk operator.
p176
aVAnd it's quite likely that they'd have a quite simple mobile phone as a phone kiosk.
p177
aVSo what I do is, I buy a prepaid card like this.
p178
aVAnd instead of using that money to top up my own phone,
p179
aVI call up the local village operator.
p180
aVAnd I read out that number to them, and they use it to top up their phone.
p181
aVSo, they're topping up the value from Kampala,
p182
aVand it's now being topped up in the village.
p183
aVYou take a 10 or 20 percent commission, and then you \u2014
p184
aVthe kiosk operator takes 10 or 20 percent commission,
p185
aVand passes the rest over to you in cash.
p186
aa(lp187
VOK, there's two things I like about this.
p188
aVSo the first is, it turns anyone who has access to a mobile phone \u2014
p189
aVanyone who has a mobile phone \u2014
p190
aVessentially into an ATM machine.
p191
aVIt brings rudimentary banking services to places
p192
aVwhere there's no banking infrastructure.
p193
aVAnd even if they could have access to the banking infrastructure,
p194
aVthey wouldn't necessarily be considered viable customers,
p195
aVbecause they're not wealthy enough to have bank accounts.
p196
aVThere's a second thing I like about this.
p197
aVAnd that is that despite all the resources at my disposal,
p198
aVand despite all our kind of apparent sophistication,
p199
aVI know I could never have designed something as elegant
p200
aVand as totally in tune with the local conditions as this. OK?
p201
aa(lp202
VAnd, yes, there are things like Grameen Bank and micro-lending.
p203
aVBut the difference between this and that
p204
aVis, there's no central authority trying to control this.
p205
aVThis is just street-up innovation.
p206
aVSo, it turns out the street is a never-ending source of
p207
aVinspiration for us.
p208
aVAnd OK, if you break one of these things here, you return it to the carrier.
p209
aVThey'll give you a new one.
p210
aVThey'll probably give you three new ones, right?
p211
aVI mean, that's buy three, get one free. That kind of thing.
p212
aVIf you go on the streets of India and China, you see this kind of stuff.
p213
aVAnd this is where they take the stuff that breaks,
p214
aVand they fix it, and they put it back into circulation.
p215
aa(lp216
VThis is from a workbench in Jilin City, in China,
p217
aVand you can see people taking down a phone
p218
aVand putting it back together.
p219
aVThey reverse-engineer manuals.
p220
aVThis is a kind of hacker's manual,
p221
aVand it's written in Chinese and English.
p222
aVThey also write them in Hindi.
p223
aVYou can subscribe to these.
p224
aVThere are training institutes where they're churning out people
p225
aVfor fixing these things as well.
p226
aVBut what I like about this is,
p227
aVit boils down to someone on the street with a small, flat surface,
p228
aVa screwdriver, a toothbrush for cleaning the contact heads \u2014
p229
aVbecause they often get dust on the contact heads \u2014 and knowledge.
p230
aVAnd it's all about the social network of the knowledge, floating around.
p231
aVAnd I like this because it challenges the way that we design stuff,
p232
aVand build stuff, and potentially distribute stuff.
p233
aVIt challenges the norms.
p234
aa(lp235
VOK, for me the street just raises so many different questions.
p236
aVLike, this is Viagra that I bought from a backstreet sex shop in China.
p237
aVAnd China is a country where you get a lot of fakes.
p238
aVAnd I know what you're asking \u2014 did I test it?
p239
aVI'm not going to answer that, OK.
p240
aVBut I look at something like this, and I consider the implications
p241
aVof trust and confidence in the purchase process.
p242
aVAnd we look at this and we think, well, how does that apply,
p243
aVfor example, for the design of \u2014 the lessons from this \u2014
p244
aVapply to the design of online services, future services in these markets?
p245
aa(lp246
VThis is a pair of underpants from \u2014
p247
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p248
aVfrom Tibet.
p249
aVAnd I look at something like this, and honestly, you know,
p250
aVwhy would someone design underpants with a pocket, right?
p251
aVAnd I look at something like this and it makes me question,
p252
aVif we were to take all the functionality in things like this,
p253
aVand redistribute them around the body
p254
aVin some kind of personal area network,
p255
aVhow would we prioritize where to put stuff?
p256
aVAnd yes, this is quite trivial, but actually the lessons from this can apply to that
p257
aVkind of personal area networks.
p258
aVAnd what you see here is a couple of phone numbers
p259
aVwritten above the shack in rural Uganda.
p260
aVThis doesn't have house numbers. This has phone numbers.
p261
aVSo what does it mean when people's identity is mobile?
p262
aVWhen those extra three billion people's identity is mobile, it isn't fixed?
p263
aVYour notion of identity is out-of-date already, OK,
p264
aVfor those extra three billion people.
p265
aVThis is how it's shifting.
p266
aa(lp267
VAnd then I go to this picture here, which is the one that I started with.
p268
aVAnd this is from Delhi.
p269
aVIt's from a study we did into illiteracy,
p270
aVand it's a guy in a teashop.
p271
aVYou can see the chai being poured in the background.
p272
aVAnd he's a, you know, incredibly poor teashop worker,
p273
aVon the lowest rungs in the society.
p274
aVAnd he, somehow, has the appreciation
p275
aVof the values of Livestrong.
p276
aVAnd it's not necessarily the same values,
p277
aVbut some kind of values of Livestrong,
p278
aVto actually go out and purchase them,
p279
aVand actually display them.
p280
aa(lp281
VFor me, this kind of personifies this connected world,
p282
aVwhere everything is intertwined, and the dots are \u2014
p283
aVit's all about the dots joining together.
p284
aVOK, the title of this presentation is "Connections and Consequences,"
p285
aVand it's really a kind of summary of five years of trying to figure out
p286
aVwhat it's going to be like when everyone on the planet
p287
aVhas the ability to transcend space and time
p288
aVin a personal and convenient manner, right?
p289
aVWhen everyone's connected.
p290
aa(lp291
VAnd there are four things.
p292
aVSo, the first thing is the immediacy of ideas,
p293
aVthe speed at which ideas go around.
p294
aVAnd I know TED is about big ideas,
p295
aVbut actually, the benchmark for a big idea is changing.
p296
aVIf you want a big idea, you need to embrace everyone on the planet,
p297
aVthat's the first thing.
p298
aa(lp299
VThe second thing is the immediacy of objects.
p300
aVAnd what I mean by that is, as these become smaller,
p301
aVas the functionality that you can access through this becomes greater \u2014
p302
aVthings like banking, identity \u2014
p303
aVthese things quite simply move very quickly around the world.
p304
aVAnd so the speed of the adoption of things
p305
aVis just going to become that much more rapid,
p306
aVin a way that we just totally cannot conceive,
p307
aVwhen you get it to 6.3 billion
p308
aVand the growth in the world's population.
p309
aa(lp310
VThe next thing is that, however we design this stuff \u2014
p311
aVcarefully design this stuff \u2014
p312
aVthe street will take it, and will figure out ways to innovate,
p313
aVas long as it meets base needs \u2014
p314
aVthe ability to transcend space and time, for example.
p315
aVAnd it will innovate in ways that we cannot anticipate.
p316
aVIn ways that, despite our resources, they can do it better than us.
p317
aVThat's my feeling.
p318
aVAnd if we're smart, we'll look at this stuff that's going on,
p319
aVand we'll figure out a way to enable it to inform and infuse
p320
aVboth what we design and how we design.
p321
aa(lp322
VAnd the last thing is that \u2014 actually, the direction of the conversation.
p323
aVWith another three billion people connected,
p324
aVthey want to be part of the conversation.
p325
aVAnd I think our relevance and TED's relevance
p326
aVis really about embracing that and learning how to listen, essentially.
p327
aVAnd we need to learn how to listen.
p328
aVSo thank you very, very much.
