VHi. So, this chap here,
p4
aVhe thinks he can tell you the future.
p5
aVHis name is Nostradamus, although here the Sun have
p6
aVmade him look a little bit like Sean Connery. (Laughter)
p7
aa(lp8
VAnd like most of you, I suspect, I don't really believe
p9
aVthat people can see into the future.
p10
aVI don't believe in precognition, and every now and then,
p11
aVyou hear that somebody has been able to predict something that happened in the future,
p12
aVand that's probably because it was a fluke, and we only
p13
aVhear about the flukes and about the freaks.
p14
aVWe don't hear about all the times that people got stuff wrong.
p15
aVNow we expect that to happen with silly stories
p16
aVabout precognition, but the problem is,
p17
aVwe have exactly the same problem in academia
p18
aVand in medicine, and in this environment, it costs lives.
p19
aa(lp20
VSo firstly, thinking just about precognition, as it turns out,
p21
aVjust last year a researcher called Daryl Bem conducted
p22
aVa piece of research where he found evidence
p23
aVof precognitive powers in undergraduate students,
p24
aVand this was published in a peer-reviewed academic journal
p25
aVand most of the people who read this just said, "Okay, well,
p26
aVfair enough, but I think that's a fluke, that's a freak, because I know
p27
aVthat if I did a study where I found no evidence
p28
aVthat undergraduate students had precognitive powers,
p29
aVit probably wouldn't get published in a journal.
p30
aVAnd in fact, we know that that's true, because
p31
aVseveral different groups of research scientists tried
p32
aVto replicate the findings of this precognition study,
p33
aVand when they submitted it to the exact same journal,
p34
aVthe journal said, "No, we're not interested in publishing
p35
aVreplication. We're not interested in your negative data."
p36
aVSo this is already evidence of how, in the academic
p37
aVliterature, we will see a biased sample of the true picture
p38
aVof all of the scientific studies that have been conducted.
p39
aa(lp40
VBut it doesn't just happen in the dry academic field of psychology.
p41
aVIt also happens in, for example, cancer research.
p42
aVSo in March, 2012, just one month ago, some researchers
p43
aVreported in the journal Nature how they had tried
p44
aVto replicate 53 different basic science studies looking at
p45
aVpotential treatment targets in cancer,
p46
aVand out of those 53 studies, they were only able
p47
aVto successfully replicate six.
p48
aVForty-seven out of those 53 were unreplicable.
p49
aVAnd they say in their discussion that this is very likely
p50
aVbecause freaks get published.
p51
aVPeople will do lots and lots and lots of different studies,
p52
aVand the occasions when it works they will publish,
p53
aVand the ones where it doesn't work they won't.
p54
aVAnd their first recommendation of how to fix this problem,
p55
aVbecause it is a problem, because it sends us all down blind alleys,
p56
aVtheir first recommendation of how to fix this problem
p57
aVis to make it easier to publish negative results in science,
p58
aVand to change the incentives so that scientists are
p59
aVencouraged to post more of their negative results in public.
p60
aa(lp61
VBut it doesn't just happen in the very dry world
p62
aVof preclinical basic science cancer research.
p63
aVIt also happens in the very real, flesh and blood
p64
aVof academic medicine. So in 1980,
p65
aVsome researchers did a study on a drug called lorcainide,
p66
aVand this was an anti-arrhythmic drug,
p67
aVa drug that suppresses abnormal heart rhythms,
p68
aVand the idea was, after people have had a heart attack,
p69
aVthey're quite likely to have abnormal heart rhythms,
p70
aVso if we give them a drug that suppresses abnormal heart
p71
aVrhythms, this will increase the chances of them surviving.
p72
aVEarly on its development, they did a very small trial,
p73
aVjust under a hundred patients.
p74
aVFifty patients got lorcainide, and of those patients, 10 died.
p75
aVAnother 50 patients got a dummy placebo sugar pill
p76
aVwith no active ingredient, and only one of them died.
p77
aVSo they rightly regarded this drug as a failure,
p78
aVand its commercial development was stopped, and because
p79
aVits commercial development was stopped, this trial was never published.
p80
aa(lp81
VUnfortunately, over the course of the next five, 10 years,
p82
aVother companies had the same idea about drugs that would
p83
aVprevent arrhythmias in people who have had heart attacks.
p84
aVThese drugs were brought to market. They were prescribed
p85
aVvery widely because heart attacks are a very common thing,
p86
aVand it took so long for us to find out that these drugs
p87
aValso caused an increased rate of death
p88
aVthat before we detected that safety signal,
p89
aVover 100,000 people died unnecessarily in America
p90
aVfrom the prescription of anti-arrhythmic drugs.
p91
aa(lp92
VNow actually, in 1993,
p93
aVthe researchers who did that 1980 study, that early study,
p94
aVpublished a mea culpa, an apology to the scientific community,
p95
aVin which they said, "When we carried out our study in 1980,
p96
aVwe thought that the increased death rate that occurred
p97
aVin the lorcainide group was an effect of chance."
p98
aVThe development of lorcainide was abandoned for commercial reasons,
p99
aVand this study was never published;
p100
aVit's now a good example of publication bias.
p101
aVThat's the technical term for the phenomenon where
p102
aVunflattering data gets lost, gets unpublished, is left
p103
aVmissing in action, and they say the results described here
p104
aV"might have provided an early warning of trouble ahead."
p105
aa(lp106
VNow these are stories from basic science.
p107
aVThese are stories from 20, 30 years ago.
p108
aVThe academic publishing environment is very different now.
p109
aVThere are academic journals like "Trials," the open access journal,
p110
aVwhich will publish any trial conducted in humans
p111
aVregardless of whether it has a positive or a negative result.
p112
aVBut this problem of negative results that go missing in action
p113
aVis still very prevalent. In fact it's so prevalent
p114
aVthat it cuts to the core of evidence-based medicine.
p115
aVSo this is a drug called reboxetine, and this is a drug
p116
aVthat I myself have prescribed. It's an antidepressant.
p117
aVAnd I'm a very nerdy doctor, so I read all of the studies
p118
aVthat I could on this drug. I read the one study that was published
p119
aVthat showed that reboxetine was better than placebo,
p120
aVand I read the other three studies that were published
p121
aVthat showed that reboxetine was just as good as any other antidepressant,
p122
aVand because this patient hadn't done well on those other antidepressants,
p123
aVI thought, well, reboxetine is just as good. It's one to try.
p124
aVBut it turned out that I was misled. In fact,
p125
aVseven trials were conducted comparing reboxetine
p126
aVagainst a dummy placebo sugar pill. One of them
p127
aVwas positive and that was published, but six of them
p128
aVwere negative and they were left unpublished.
p129
aVThree trials were published comparing reboxetine
p130
aVagainst other antidepressants in which reboxetine
p131
aVwas just as good, and they were published,
p132
aVbut three times as many patients' worth of data was collected
p133
aVwhich showed that reboxetine was worse than
p134
aVthose other treatments, and those trials were not published.
p135
aVI felt misled.
p136
aa(lp137
VNow you might say, well, that's an extremely unusual example,
p138
aVand I wouldn't want to be guilty of the same kind of
p139
aVcherry-picking and selective referencing
p140
aVthat I'm accusing other people of.
p141
aVBut it turns out that this phenomenon of publication bias
p142
aVhas actually been very, very well studied.
p143
aVSo here is one example of how you approach it.
p144
aVThe classic model is, you get a bunch of studies where
p145
aVyou know that they've been conducted and completed,
p146
aVand then you go and see if they've been published anywhere
p147
aVin the academic literature. So this took all of the trials
p148
aVthat had ever been conducted on antidepressants
p149
aVthat were approved over a 15-year period by the FDA.
p150
aVThey took all of the trials which were submitted to the FDA as part of the approval package.
p151
aVSo that's not all of the trials that were ever conducted on these drugs,
p152
aVbecause we can never know if we have those,
p153
aVbut it is the ones that were conducted in order to get the marketing authorization.
p154
aVAnd then they went to see if these trials had been published
p155
aVin the peer-reviewed academic literature. And this is what they found.
p156
aVIt was pretty much a 50-50 split. Half of these trials
p157
aVwere positive, half of them were negative, in reality.
p158
aVBut when they went to look for these trials in the peer-reviewed academic literature,
p159
aVwhat they found was a very different picture.
p160
aVOnly three of the negative trials were published,
p161
aVbut all but one of the positive trials were published.
p162
aVNow if we just flick back and forth between those two,
p163
aVyou can see what a staggering difference there was
p164
aVbetween reality and what doctors, patients,
p165
aVcommissioners of health services, and academics
p166
aVwere able to see in the peer-reviewed academic literature.
p167
aVWe were misled, and this is a systematic flaw
p168
aVin the core of medicine.
p169
aa(lp170
VIn fact, there have been so many studies conducted on
p171
aVpublication bias now, over a hundred, that they've been
p172
aVcollected in a systematic review, published in 2010,
p173
aVthat took every single study on publication bias
p174
aVthat they could find.
p175
aVPublication bias affects every field of medicine.
p176
aVAbout half of all trials, on average, go missing in action,
p177
aVand we know that positive findings are around twice as likely
p178
aVto be published as negative findings.
p179
aa(lp180
VThis is a cancer at the core of evidence-based medicine.
p181
aVIf I flipped a coin 100 times but then
p182
aVwithheld the results from you from half of those tosses,
p183
aVI could make it look as if I had a coin that always came up heads.
p184
aVBut that wouldn't mean that I had a two-headed coin.
p185
aVThat would mean that I was a chancer
p186
aVand you were an idiot for letting me get away with it. (Laughter)
p187
aVBut this is exactly what we blindly tolerate
p188
aVin the whole of evidence-based medicine.
p189
aVAnd to me, this is research misconduct.
p190
aVIf I conducted one study and I withheld
p191
aVhalf of the data points from that one study,
p192
aVyou would rightly accuse me, essentially, of research fraud.
p193
aVAnd yet, for some reason, if somebody conducts
p194
aV10 studies but only publishes the five that give the result that they want,
p195
aVwe don't consider that to be research misconduct.
p196
aVAnd when that responsibility is diffused between
p197
aVa whole network of researchers, academics,
p198
aVindustry sponsors, journal editors, for some reason
p199
aVwe find it more acceptable,
p200
aVbut the effect on patients is damning.
p201
aa(lp202
VAnd this is happening right now, today.
p203
aVThis is a drug called Tamiflu. Tamiflu is a drug
p204
aVwhich governments around the world have spent billions
p205
aVand billions of dollars on stockpiling,
p206
aVand we've stockpiled Tamiflu in panic,
p207
aVin the belief that it will reduce the rate of complications of influenza.
p208
aVComplications is a medical euphemism for pneumonia
p209
aVand death. (Laughter)
p210
aVNow when the Cochrane systematic reviewers
p211
aVwere trying to collect together all of the data from all
p212
aVof the trials that had ever been conducted on whether Tamiflu actually did this or not,
p213
aVthey found that several of those trials were unpublished.
p214
aVThe results were unavailable to them.
p215
aVAnd when they started obtaining the writeups of those trials through various different means,
p216
aVthrough Freedom of Information Act requests, through
p217
aVharassing various different organizations, what they found was inconsistent.
p218
aVAnd when they tried to get a hold of the clinical study reports,
p219
aVthe 10,000-page long documents that have
p220
aVthe best possible rendition of the information,
p221
aVthey were told they weren't allowed to have them.
p222
aVAnd if you want to read the full correspondence
p223
aVand the excuses and the explanations given by the drug company,
p224
aVyou can see that written up in this week's edition
p225
aVof PLOS Medicine.
p226
aa(lp227
VAnd the most staggering thing of all of this, to me,
p228
aVis that not only is this a problem, not only do we recognize
p229
aVthat this is a problem, but we've had to suffer fake fixes.
p230
aVWe've had people pretend that this is a problem that's been fixed.
p231
aVFirst of all, we had trials registers, and everybody said,
p232
aVoh, it's okay. We'll get everyone to register their trials, they'll post the protocol,
p233
aVthey'll say what they're going to do before they do it,
p234
aVand then afterwards we'll be able to check and see if all the trials which
p235
aVhave been conducted and completed have been published.
p236
aVBut people didn't bother to use those registers.
p237
aVAnd so then the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors came along,
p238
aVand they said, oh, well, we will hold the line.
p239
aVWe won't publish any journals, we won't publish any trials,
p240
aVunless they've been registered before they began.
p241
aVBut they didn't hold the line. In 2008, a study was conducted
p242
aVwhich showed that half of all of trials published by journals
p243
aVedited by members of the ICMJE
p244
aVweren't properly registered, and a quarter of them weren't registered at all.
p245
aVAnd then finally, the FDA Amendment Act was passed
p246
aVa couple of years ago saying that everybody who conducts
p247
aVa trial must post the results of that trial within one year.
p248
aVAnd in the BMJ, in the first edition of January, 2012,
p249
aVyou can see a study which looks to see if people kept
p250
aVto that ruling, and it turns out that only one in five
p251
aVhave done so.
p252
aa(lp253
VThis is a disaster.
p254
aVWe cannot know the true effects of the medicines
p255
aVthat we prescribe if we do not have access
p256
aVto all of the information.
p257
aa(lp258
VAnd this is not a difficult problem to fix.
p259
aVWe need to force people to publish all trials
p260
aVconducted in humans, including the older trials,
p261
aVbecause the FDA Amendment Act only asks that you publish the trials conducted after 2008,
p262
aVand I don't know what world it is in which we're only
p263
aVpracticing medicine on the basis of trials that completed in the past two years.
p264
aVWe need to publish all trials in humans,
p265
aVincluding the older trials, for all drugs in current use,
p266
aVand you need to tell everyone you know
p267
aVthat this is a problem and that it has not been fixed.
p268
aVThank you very much. (Applause)
