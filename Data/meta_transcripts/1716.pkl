VWhen I was 14 years old,
p4
aVI had low self-esteem.
p5
aVI felt I was not talented at anything.
p6
aa(lp7
VOne day, I bought a yo-yo.
p8
aVWhen I tried my first trick, it looked like this:
p9
aa(lp10
V(Laughter)
p11
aa(lp12
VI couldn't even do the simplest trick,
p13
aVbut it was very natural for me,
p14
aVbecause I was not dextrous, and hated all sports.
p15
aVBut after one week of practicing,
p16
aVmy throws became more like this:
p17
aVA bit better.
p18
aVI thought, the yo-yo is something for me to be good at.
p19
aVFor the first time in my life,
p20
aVI found my passion.
p21
aVI was spending all my time practicing.
p22
aVIt took me hours and hours a day to build my skills up to the next level.
p23
aa(lp24
VAnd then, four years later, when I was 18 years old,
p25
aVI was standing onstage at the World YoYo Contest.
p26
aVAnd I won.
p27
aVI was so excited.
p28
aV"Yes, I did it! I became a hero.
p29
aVI may get many sponsors, a lot of money,
p30
aVtons of interviews, and be on TV!" I thought.
p31
aa(lp32
V(Laughter)
p33
aa(lp34
VBut after coming back to Japan,
p35
aVtotally nothing changed in my life.
p36
aa(lp37
V(Laughter)
p38
aa(lp39
VI realized society didn't value my passion.
p40
aVSo I went back to my college
p41
aVand became a typical Japanese worker as a systems engineer.
p42
aVI felt my passion, heart and soul, had left my body.
p43
aVI felt I was not alive anymore.
p44
aa(lp45
VSo I started to consider what I should do,
p46
aVand I thought, I wanted to make my performance better,
p47
aVand to show onstage how spectacular the yo-yo could be
p48
aVto change the public's image of the yo-yo.
p49
aa(lp50
VSo I quit my company
p51
aVand started a career as a professional performer.
p52
aVI started to learn classic ballet, jazz dance, acrobatics and other things
p53
aVto make my performance better.
p54
aa(lp55
VAs a result of these efforts, and the help of many others,
p56
aVit happened.
p57
aVI won the World YoYo Contest again in the artistic performance division.
p58
aVI passed an audition for Cirque Du Soleil.
p59
aVToday, I am standing on the TED stage
p60
aVwith the yo-yo in front of you.
p61
aa(lp62
V(Applause)
p63
aa(lp64
VWhat I learned from the yo-yo is,
p65
aVif I make enough effort with huge passion,
p66
aVthere is no impossible.
p67
aa(lp68
VCould you let me share my passion with you
p69
aVthrough my performance?
