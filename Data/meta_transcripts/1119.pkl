VHow often do we hear that people just don't care?
p4
aVHow many times have you been told
p5
aVthat real, substantial change isn't possible
p6
aVbecause most people are too selfish,
p7
aVtoo stupid or too lazy
p8
aVto try to make a difference in their community?
p9
aVI propose to you today that apathy as we think we know it
p10
aVdoesn't actually exist;
p11
aVbut rather, that people do care,
p12
aVbut that we live in a world that actively discourages engagement
p13
aVby constantly putting obstacles and barriers in our way.
p14
aa(lp15
VI'll give you some examples of what I mean.
p16
aVLet's start with city hall.
p17
aVYou ever see one of these before?
p18
aVThis is a newspaper ad.
p19
aVIt's a notice of a zoning application change for a new office building
p20
aVso the neighborhood knows what's happening.
p21
aVAs you can see, it's impossible to read.
p22
aVYou need to get halfway down
p23
aVto even find out which address they're talking about,
p24
aVand then further down, in tiny 10-point font,
p25
aVto find out how to actually get involved.
p26
aVImagine if the private sector advertised in the same way \u2014
p27
aVif Nike wanted to sell a pair of shoes \u2014
p28
aa(lp29
V(Laughter)
p30
aa(lp31
VAnd put an ad in the paper like that.
p32
aa(lp33
V(Applause)
p34
aa(lp35
VNow, that would never happen.
p36
aVYou'll never see an ad like that,
p37
aVbecause Nike actually wants you to buy their shoes,
p38
aVwhereas the city of Toronto clearly doesn't want you involved
p39
aVwith the planning process,
p40
aVotherwise their ads would look something like this,
p41
aVwith all the information laid out clearly.
p42
aVAs long as the city's putting out notices like this
p43
aVto try to get people engaged,
p44
aVthen of course people aren't going to be engaged.
p45
aVBut that's not apathy; that's intentional exclusion.
p46
aa(lp47
VPublic space.
p48
aa(lp49
V(Applause)
p50
aa(lp51
VThe manner in which we mistreat our public spaces
p52
aVis a huge obstacle towards any type of progressive political change,
p53
aVbecause we've essentially put a price tag on freedom of expression.
p54
aVWhoever has the most money gets the loudest voice,
p55
aVdominating the visual and mental environment.
p56
aVThe problem with this model is there are some amazing messages
p57
aVthat need to be said, that aren't profitable to say.
p58
aVSo you're never going to see them on a billboard.
p59
aa(lp60
VThe media plays an important role
p61
aVin developing our relationship with political change,
p62
aVmainly by ignoring politics and focusing on celebrities and scandals,
p63
aVbut even when they do talk about important political issues,
p64
aVthey do it in a way that I feel discourages engagement.
p65
aVI'll give you an example.
p66
aVThe "Now" magazine from last week: progressive, downtown weekly in Toronto.
p67
aVThis is the cover story.
p68
aVIt's an article about a theater performance,
p69
aVand it starts with basic information about where it is,
p70
aVin case you actually want to go and see it after you've read the article \u2014
p71
aVwhere, the time, the website.
p72
aVSame with this \u2014 it's a movie review.
p73
aVAn art review.
p74
aVA book review \u2014 where the reading is in case you want to go.
p75
aVA restaurant \u2014 you might not want to just read about it,
p76
aVmaybe you want to go there.
p77
aVSo they tell you where it is, the prices, the address, the phone number, etc.
p78
aa(lp79
VThen you get to their political articles.
p80
aVHere's a great article about an important election race that's happening.
p81
aVIt talks about the candidates, written very well,
p82
aVbut no information, no follow-up, no websites for the campaigns,
p83
aVno information about when the debates are, where the campaign offices are.
p84
aVHere's another good article,
p85
aVabout a new campaign opposing privatization of transit,
p86
aVwithout any contact information for the campaign.
p87
aVThe message seems to be
p88
aVthat the readers are most likely to want to eat, maybe read a book,
p89
aVmaybe see a movie, but not be engaged in their community.
p90
aVYou might think this is a small thing, but I think it's important,
p91
aVbecause it sets a tone
p92
aVand it reinforces the dangerous idea that politics is a spectator sport.
p93
aa(lp94
VHeroes: How do we view leadership?
p95
aVLook at these 10 movies. What do they have in common?
p96
aVAnyone?
p97
aVThey all have heroes who were chosen.
p98
aVSomeone came up to them and said, "You're the chosen one.
p99
aVThere's a prophecy. You have to save the world."
p100
aVAnd then they go off and save the world because they've been told to,
p101
aVwith a few people tagging along.
p102
aVThis helps me understand
p103
aVwhy a lot of people have trouble seeing themselves as leaders \u2014
p104
aVbecause it sends all the wrong messages about what leadership is about.
p105
aVA heroic effort is a collective effort,
p106
aVnumber one.
p107
aVNumber two, it's imperfect; it's not very glamorous,
p108
aVand doesn't suddenly start and suddenly end.
p109
aVIt's an ongoing process your whole life.
p110
aVBut most importantly, it's voluntary.
p111
aVIt's voluntary.
p112
aVAs long as we're teaching our kids
p113
aVthat heroism starts when someone scratches a mark on your forehead,
p114
aVor someone tells you you're part of a prophecy,
p115
aVthey're missing the most important characteristic of leadership,
p116
aVwhich is that it comes from within.
p117
aVIt's about following your own dreams, uninvited,
p118
aVand then working with others to make those dreams come true.
p119
aa(lp120
VPolitical parties: oh, boy.
p121
aVPolitical parties could and should be one of the basic entry points
p122
aVfor people to get engaged in politics.
p123
aVInstead, they've become, sadly,
p124
aVuninspiring and uncreative organizations
p125
aVthat rely so heavily on market research and polling and focus groups
p126
aVthat they end up all saying the same thing,
p127
aVpretty much regurgitating back to us what we already want to hear
p128
aVat the expense of putting forward bold and creative ideas.
p129
aVAnd people can smell that, and it feeds cynicism.
p130
aa(lp131
V(Applause)
p132
aa(lp133
VCharitable status.
p134
aVGroups who have charitable status in Canada aren't allowed to do advocacy.
p135
aVThis is a huge problem and a huge obstacle to change,
p136
aVbecause it means that some of the most passionate and informed voices
p137
aVare completely silenced, especially during election time.
p138
aVWhich leads us to the last one, which is: our elections.
p139
aa(lp140
VAs you may have noticed,
p141
aVour elections in Canada are a complete joke.
p142
aVWe use out-of-date systems
p143
aVthat are unfair and create random results.
p144
aVCanada's currently led by a party
p145
aVthat most Canadians didn't actually want.
p146
aVHow can we honestly and genuinely encourage more people to vote
p147
aVwhen votes don't count in Canada?
p148
aVYou add all this up together, and of course people are apathetic.
p149
aVIt's like trying to run into a brick wall.
p150
aa(lp151
VNow, I'm not trying to be negative by throwing all these obstacles out
p152
aVand explaining what's in our way.
p153
aVQuite the opposite \u2014
p154
aVI actually think people are amazing and smart and that they do care,
p155
aVbut that, as I said, we live in this environment
p156
aVwhere all these obstacles are being put in our way.
p157
aVAs long as we believe that people, our own neighbors,
p158
aVare selfish, stupid or lazy,
p159
aVthen there's no hope.
p160
aVBut we can change all those things I mentioned.
p161
aVWe can open up city hall.
p162
aVWe can reform our electoral systems.
p163
aVWe can democratize our public spaces.
p164
aa(lp165
VMy main message is:
p166
aVif we can redefine apathy,
p167
aVnot as some kind of internal syndrome,
p168
aVbut as a complex web of cultural barriers that reinforces disengagement,
p169
aVand if we can clearly define, clearly identify what those obstacles are,
p170
aVand then if we can work together collectively to dismantle those obstacles,
p171
aVthen anything is possible.
p172
aa(lp173
