VThe north coast of California has rainforests \u2014
p4
aVtemperate rainforests \u2014 where it can rain more than 100 inches a year.
p5
aVThis is the realm of the Coast Redwood tree.
p6
aVIts species name is Sequoia sempervirens.
p7
aVSequoia sempervirens is the tallest living organism on Earth.
p8
aVThe range of the species goes up to as much as 380 feet tall.
p9
aVThat's 38 stories tall.
p10
aVThese are trees that would stand out in midtown Manhattan.
p11
aVNobody knows how old the oldest living Coast Redwoods are
p12
aVbecause nobody has ever drilled into any of them
p13
aVto count their annual growth rings, and, in any case,
p14
aVthe centers of the oldest individuals appear to be hollow.
p15
aVBut it's believed that the oldest living Redwoods
p16
aVare perhaps 2,500 years old \u2014 roughly the age of the Parthenon \u2014
p17
aValthough it's also suspected that there may be individual trees
p18
aVthat are older than that.
p19
aa(lp20
VYou can see the range of the Coast Redwoods. It's here, in red.
p21
aVThe largest individuals of this species,
p22
aVthe dreadnoughts of their kind, live just on the north coast of California,
p23
aVwhere the rain is really intense.
p24
aVIn recent historic times, about 96 percent of the Coast Redwood forest
p25
aVwas cut down, especially in a series of bursts of intense liquidation logging,
p26
aVclear-cutting that took place in the 1970s through the early 1990s.
p27
aVEven so, about four percent of the primeval Redwood rainforest remains intact,
p28
aVwild and now protected \u2014 entirely protected \u2014
p29
aVin a chain of small parks strung out like pearls
p30
aValong the north coast of California, including Redwood National Park.
p31
aVBut curiously, Redwood rainforests, the fragments that we have left,
p32
aVto this day remain under-explored.
p33
aVRedwood rainforest is incredibly difficult to move through,
p34
aVand even today, individual trees are being discovered
p35
aVthat have never been seen before, including, in the summer of 2006,
p36
aVHyperion, the world's tallest tree.
p37
aa(lp38
VI'm going to do a little Gedanken experiment.
p39
aVI'm going to ask you to imagine what a Redwood really is as a living organism.
p40
aVAnd, Chris, if I could have you up here? I have a tape measure.
p41
aVIt's a kind loaner from TED.
p42
aVAnd Chris, if you could take the end of that tape measure?
p43
aVWe're going to show you what the diameter
p44
aVat breast height of a big Redwood is.
p45
aVUnfortunately, this tape isn't long enough \u2014 it's only a 25-foot tape.
p46
aVChris, could you extend your arm out that way? There we go. OK.
p47
aVAnd maybe about here, about 30 feet, is the diameter of a big Redwood.
p48
aVNow, let your imagination go upward into space.
p49
aVThink about this tree, rising upward into Redwood space, 325 feet,
p50
aV32 stories, an individual living organism articulating its forms
p51
aVupward into space over long periods of time.
p52
aa(lp53
VThe Redwood species seems to exist in another kind of time:
p54
aVnot human time, but what we might call Redwood time.
p55
aVRedwood time moves at a more stately pace than human time.
p56
aVTo us, when we look at a Redwood tree, it seems to be motionless and still,
p57
aVand yet Redwoods are constantly in motion,
p58
aVmoving upward into space, articulating themselves
p59
aVand filling Redwood space over Redwood time, over thousands of years.
p60
aVPlant this small seed, wait 2,000 years, and you get this:
p61
aVthe Lost Monarch.
p62
aVIt dwells in the Grove of Titans on the north coast,
p63
aVand was discovered in 1998.
p64
aVAnd yet, when you look at the base of a Redwood tree,
p65
aVyou're not seeing the organism.
p66
aVYou're like a mouse looking at the foot of an elephant,
p67
aVand most of the organism is overhead, unseen.
p68
aa(lp69
VI became very interested, and I wrote about a couple.
p70
aVSteve Sillett and Marie Antoine are the principal explorers
p71
aVof the Redwood forest canopy. They're world-class athletes,
p72
aVand they also are world-class forest ecology scientists.
p73
aVSteve Sillett, when he was a 19-year-old college student
p74
aVat Reed College, had heard that the Redwood forest canopy
p75
aVis considered to be a so-called Redwood desert.
p76
aVThat is to say, at that time it was believed
p77
aVthat there was nothing up there except the branches of Redwood trees.
p78
aVAnd with a friend of his, he took it upon himself to free-climb a Redwood
p79
aVwithout ropes or any equipment to see what was up there.
p80
aVHe climbed up a small tree next to this giant Redwood,
p81
aVand then he leaped through space and grabbed a branch with his hands,
p82
aVand ended up hanging, like catching a bar of a trapeze.
p83
aVAnd then, from there, he climbed directly up the bark
p84
aVuntil he got to the top of the tree.
p85
aa(lp86
VHis friend, a guy named Marwood Harris, was following behind.
p87
aVNeither one of them had noticed that there was
p88
aVa Yellow Jacket wasp's nest the size of a bowling ball
p89
aVhanging from the branch that Steve had jumped into.
p90
aVAnd when Marwood made the jump, he was covered with wasps
p91
aVstinging him in the face and eyes. He nearly let go.
p92
aVHe would have fallen to his death, being 75 feet above the ground.
p93
aVBut they made it to the top, and what they found
p94
aVwas not a Redwood desert, but a lost world \u2014
p95
aVa kind of three-dimensional labyrinth in the air, filled with unknown life.
p96
aVNow, I had been working on other topics:
p97
aVthe emergence of infectious diseases,
p98
aVwhich come out of the natural ecosystems of the Earth,
p99
aVmake a trans-species jump, and get into humans.
p100
aa(lp101
VAfter three books on this, it got to be a bit much, in a way.
p102
aVMy wife and I adore our children.
p103
aVAnd I began climbing trees with my kids as just something to do with them,
p104
aVusing the so-called arborist climbing technique,
p105
aVwith ropes. You use ropes to get yourself up into the crown of a tree.
p106
aVChildren are incredibly adept at climbing trees.
p107
aVThat's my son, Oliver.
p108
aVThey don't seem to suffer from the same fear of heights that humans do.
p109
aa(lp110
V(Laughter)
p111
aa(lp112
VIf ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny, then children
p113
aVare somewhat closer to our roots as primates in the arboreal forest.
p114
aVHumans appear to be the only primates that I know of
p115
aVthat are afraid of heights.
p116
aVAll other primates, when they're scared,
p117
aVthey run up a tree, where they feel safe.
p118
aVWe camped overnight in the trees, in tree boats.
p119
aVThis is my daughter Laura, then 15, looking out of a tree boat.
p120
aVShe's, by the way, tied in with a rope so she can't fall.
p121
aVLooking out of a tree boat in the morning and hearing birdsong
p122
aVcoming in three dimensions around us.
p123
aVWe had been visited in the night by flying squirrels,
p124
aVwho don't seem to recognize humans for what they are
p125
aVbecause they've never seen them in the canopy before.
p126
aVAnd we practiced advanced techniques like sky-walking,
p127
aVwhere you can move from tree to tree through space,
p128
aVrather like Spiderman.
p129
aVIt became a writing project.
p130
aa(lp131
VWhen Steve Sillett gets up into a big Redwood, he fires an arrow,
p132
aVwhich trails a fishing line, which gets over a branch in the tree,
p133
aVand then you ascend up a rope which has been dragged into the tree by the line.
p134
aVYou ascend 30 stories.
p135
aVThere are two people climbing this tree, Gaya,
p136
aVwhich is thought to be one of the oldest Redwoods. There they are.
p137
aVThey are only one-seventh of the way up that tree.
p138
aVYou do feel a sense of exposure.
p139
aVThere is a small person right down there on the ground.
p140
aVYou feel like you're climbing a wall of wood.
p141
aVBut then you enter the Redwood canopy,
p142
aVand it's like coming through a layer of clouds.
p143
aVAnd all of a sudden, you lose sight of the ground,
p144
aVand you also lose sight of the sky,
p145
aVand you're in a three-dimensional labyrinth in the air
p146
aVfilled with hanging gardens of ferns growing out of soil,
p147
aVwhich is populated with all kinds of small organisms.
p148
aa(lp149
VThere are epiphytes, plants that grow on trees.
p150
aVThese are huckleberry bushes.
p151
aVMany species of mosses, and then all sorts of lichens just plastering the tree.
p152
aVWhen you get near the top of the tree, you feel like you can't fall \u2014
p153
aVin fact, it's difficult to move.
p154
aVYou're worming your way through branches which are crowded
p155
aVwith living things that don't occur near the ground.
p156
aVIt's like scuba diving into a coral reef,
p157
aVexcept you're going upward instead of downward.
p158
aVAnd then the trees tend to flare out into platform-like areas at the top.
p159
aVMaria's sitting on one of them.
p160
aVThese limbs could be five to six hundred years old.
p161
aVRedwoods grow very slowly in their tops.
p162
aVThey also have a feature: thickets of huckleberry bushes
p163
aVthat grow out of the tops of Redwood trees
p164
aVthat are technically known as huckleberry afros,
p165
aVand you can sit there and snack on the berries while you're resting.
p166
aa(lp167
VRedwoods have an enormous surface area that extends upward into space
p168
aVbecause they have a propensity to do something called reiteration.
p169
aVA Redwood is a fractal. And as they put out limbs,
p170
aVthe limbs burst into small trees, copies of the Redwood.
p171
aVNow, here we see a reiteration in Chronos, one of the older Redwoods.
p172
aVThis reiteration is a huge flying buttress
p173
aVthat comes out the tree itself.
p174
aVThis buttress is less than halfway up the tree.
p175
aVAnd then it bursts into a forest of Redwoods.
p176
aVThis particular extra trunk is a meter across at the base
p177
aVand extends upward for 150 feet.
p178
aVIt's as big as any of the biggest trees east of the Mississippi River,
p179
aVand yet it's only a minor feature on Chronos.
p180
aa(lp181
VThis three-dimensional map of the crown structure of a Redwood named Iluvatar,
p182
aVmade by Steve Sillett, Marie Antoine and their colleagues, gives you an idea.
p183
aVWhat you're seeing here is a hierarchical schematic development
p184
aVof the trunks of this tree as it has elaborated itself over time into six layers of fractal,
p185
aVof trunks springing from trunks springing from trunks.
p186
aVI asked Steve to put a human being in this to give a sense of scale.
p187
aVThere's the person, right there. The person is waving to us.
p188
aVI've wanted to ask Craig Venter if it would be possible to insert
p189
aVa synthetic chromosome into a human
p190
aVso that we could reiterate ourselves if we wanted to.
p191
aVAnd if we were able to reiterate, then the fingers of our hand
p192
aVwould be people who looked like us,
p193
aVand they would have people on their hands and so on.
p194
aVAnd if we had Redwood-like biology,
p195
aVwe would have six layers of people on our hands, as it were.
p196
aVAnd it would be a lovely thing to be able to wave to someone
p197
aVand have all our reiterations wave at the same time.
p198
aa(lp199
V(Laughter)
p200
aa(lp201
VTo reiterate the point, let's go closer into Iluvatar.
p202
aVWe're looking at that yellow box.
p203
aVAnd this hallucinatory drawing shows you \u2014
p204
aVeverything you see in this drawing is Iluvatar.
p205
aVThese are millennial structures \u2014 portions of the tree
p206
aVthat are believed to be more than 1,000 years old.
p207
aVThere are four humans in this shot \u2014 one, two, three, four.
p208
aVAnd there's also something that I want to show you.
p209
aVThis is a flying buttress.
p210
aVRedwoods grow back into themselves as they expand into space,
p211
aVand this flying buttress is a limb shot out of that small trunk,
p212
aVgoing back into the main trunk and fusing with it.
p213
aVFlying buttresses, just as in a cathedral, help strengthen the crown of the tree
p214
aVand help the tree exist longer through time.
p215
aVThe scientists are doing all kinds of experiments in these trees.
p216
aVThey've wired them like patients in an ICU.
p217
aa(lp218
VThey're finding out that Redwoods can move moisture out of the air
p219
aVand down into their trunks,
p220
aVpossibly all the way into their root systems.
p221
aVThey also have the ability to put roots anywhere in the tree itself.
p222
aVIf a portion of a Redwood is rotting,
p223
aVthe Redwood will send roots into its own form
p224
aVand draw nutrients out of itself as it falls apart.
p225
aVIf we had Redwood-like biology, if we got a touch of gangrene in our arm
p226
aVthen we could just, you know,
p227
aVextract the nutrients extract the nutrients and the moisture out of it until it fell off.
p228
aVCanopy soil can occur up to a meter deep,
p229
aVhundreds of feet above the ground, and there are organisms in this soil
p230
aVthat have, as yet, no names.
p231
aa(lp232
VThis is an unnamed species of copepod. A copepod is a crustacean.
p233
aVThese copepods are a major constituent of the oceans,
p234
aVand they are a major part of the diet of grazing baleen whales.
p235
aVWhat they're doing in the Redwood forest canopy soil
p236
aVhundreds of feet above the ocean, or how they got there,
p237
aVis completely unknown.
p238
aVThere are some interesting theories
p239
aVthat, if I had time, I would tell you about.
p240
aVBut as you go and you look closer at a tree,
p241
aVwhat you see is, you see increasing complexity.
p242
aVWe're looking at the very top of Gaya, which is thought to be the oldest Redwood.
p243
aVGaya may be 3,000 to 5,000 years old,
p244
aVno one really knows, but its top has broken off
p245
aVand it's been rotting back now.
p246
aa(lp247
VThis little Japanese garden-like creation probably took 700 years
p248
aVto form in its complexity that we see right now.
p249
aVAs you look at a tree, it takes a magnifying glass to see a giant tree.
p250
aVI have to show you something unfortunately very sad
p251
aVat the conclusion of this talk.
p252
aVThe Eastern Hemlock tree has often been described as the Redwood of the East.
p253
aVAnd we're moving in a full circle now.
p254
aVIn the 1950s, a small organism appeared in Richmond, Virginia,
p255
aVcalled the Hemlock woolly adelgid.
p256
aVIt made a trans-species jump out of some other organism in Asia,
p257
aVwhere it was living on Hemlock trees in Asia.
p258
aVWhen it moved into its new host, the Eastern Hemlock tree,
p259
aVit escaped its predators, and the new tree had no resistance to it.
p260
aVThe Eastern Hemlock forest is being considered in some ways
p261
aVthe last fragments of primeval rainforest east of the Mississippi River.
p262
aa(lp263
VI hadn't even known that there were rainforests in the east,
p264
aVbut in Great Smoky Mountains National Park
p265
aVit can rain up to 100 inches of rain a year.
p266
aVAnd in the last two to three summers, these invasive organisms,
p267
aVthis kind of Ebola of the trees, as it were,
p268
aVhas swept through the primeval Hemlock forest of the east,
p269
aVand has absolutely wiped it out. I climbed there this past summer.
p270
aVThis is Great Smoky Mountains National Park,
p271
aVand the Hemlocks are dead as far as the eye can see.
p272
aVAnd what we're seeing is not just the potential death
p273
aVof the Eastern Hemlock species \u2014
p274
aVthat is to say, its extinction from nature due to this invading parasite \u2014
p275
aVbut we're also seeing the death of an incredibly complex ecosystem
p276
aVfor which these trees are merely the substrate
p277
aVfor the aerial labyrinth of the sky that exists in their crowns.
p278
aa(lp279
VIt's absolutely heartbreaking to see.
p280
aVOne of the things that is just \u2014 I almost can't conceive it \u2014
p281
aVis the idea that the national news media hasn't picked this up at all,
p282
aVand this is the devastation of one of the most important ecosystems in North America.
p283
aVWhat can the Redwoods tell us about ourselves?
p284
aVWell, I think they can tell us something about human time.
p285
aVThe flickering, transitory quality of human time
p286
aVand the brevity of human life \u2014 the necessity to love.
p287
aVBut we're different from trees, and they can also teach us
p288
aVsomething about ourselves in the differences that we have.
p289
aVWe are human, and we have the capacity to love,
p290
aVwe have the capacity to wonder, and we have a sort of
p291
aVboundless curiosity, a restless inquisitiveness
p292
aVthat so suits us as primates, I think.
p293
aa(lp294
VAnd at least for me, personally, the trees have taught me
p295
aVan entirely new way of loving my children.
p296
aVExploring with them the forest canopy
p297
aVhas been one of the most lovely things of my existence on Earth.
p298
aVAnd I think that one of the happiest things is the sense that
p299
aVwith my children I've been able to introduce them
p300
aVinto the very small circle of humans who are lucky enough,
p301
aVor possibly stupid enough, to still climb trees.
p302
aVThank you very much.
p303
aa(lp304
V(Applause)
p305
aa(lp306
VChris Anderson: I think at a previous TED,
p307
aVI think it was Nathan Myhrvold who told me that it was thought that
p308
aVbecause these trees are like, 2,000 years and older,
p309
aVon many of them there are ecosystems where there are species
p310
aVthat are not found anywhere on the Earth
p311
aVexcept on that one tree. Is that correct?
p312
aa(lp313
VRichard Preston: Yes, that is correct. I mentioned Hyperion, the world's tallest tree.
p314
aVAnd I was a member of a climbing team that made the first climb of it, in 2006.
p315
aVAnd while we were climbing Hyperion, Marie Antoine spotted
p316
aVan unknown species of golden-brown ant about halfway up the trunk.
p317
aVAnts are not known to occur in Redwood trees, curiously enough,
p318
aVand we wondered whether this ant, this species of ant,
p319
aVwas only endemic to that one tree, or possibly to that grove.
p320
aVAnd in subsequent climbs they could never find that ant again,
p321
aVand so no specimens have ever been collected.
p322
aVWe don't know what it is \u2014 we just know it's there.
p323
aa(lp324
VCA: So, you have to wonder when, you know,
p325
aVif some other species than us was recording the stories that mattered on Earth,
p326
aVyou know, our stories are about Iraq and war and politics and celebrity gossip.
p327
aVYou've just told us a different story of this tragic arms race that's happening,
p328
aVand maybe whole ecosystems gone forever.
p329
aVIt's an amazing sense of wonder you've given me,
p330
aVand a sense of just how fragile this whole thing is.
p331
aa(lp332
VRP: It is fragile, and you know, I think about emerging human diseases \u2014
p333
aVparasites that move into the human species.
p334
aVBut that's just a very small facet
p335
aVof a much greater problem of invasions of species worldwide,
p336
aVall through the ecosystems, and you know, the Earth itself \u2014
p337
aa(lp338
VCA: Partly caused by us, inadvertently.
p339
aa(lp340
VRP: Caused by humans. Caused by the movement of humans.
p341
aVYou can think of the Earth's biosphere as a palace,
p342
aVand the continents are rooms in the palace,
p343
aVand the islands are small rooms.
p344
aVBut lately, the doors of the palace have been flung open,
p345
aVand the walls are coming down.
p346
aa(lp347
VCA: Richard Preston, thank you very much, I think.
p348
aa(lp349
