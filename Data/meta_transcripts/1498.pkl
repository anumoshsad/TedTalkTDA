VI'd like to talk about my dad.
p4
aVMy dad has Alzheimer's disease.
p5
aVHe started showing the symptoms about 12 years ago,
p6
aVand he was officially diagnosed in 2005.
p7
aVNow he's really pretty sick. He needs help eating,
p8
aVhe needs help getting dressed, he doesn't really know where he is
p9
aVor when it is, and it's been really, really hard.
p10
aVMy dad was my hero and my mentor for most of my life,
p11
aVand I've spent the last decade watching him disappear.
p12
aa(lp13
VMy dad's not alone. There's about 35 million people globally living with some kind of dementia,
p14
aVand by 2030 they're expecting that to double to 70 million.
p15
aVThat's a lot of people.
p16
aVDementia scares us. The confused faces and shaky hands of people who have dementia,
p17
aVthe big numbers of people who get it, they frighten us.
p18
aVAnd because of that fear, we tend to do one of two things:
p19
aVWe go into denial: "It's not me, it has nothing to do with me, it's never going to happen to me."
p20
aVOr, we decide that we're going to prevent dementia,
p21
aVand it will never happen to us because we're going to do everything right and it won't come and get us.
p22
aVI'm looking for a third way: I'm preparing to get Alzheimer's disease.
p23
aa(lp24
VPrevention is good, and I'm doing the things that you can do to prevent Alzheimer's.
p25
aVI'm eating right, I'm exercising every day, I'm keeping my mind active,
p26
aVthat's what the research says you should do.
p27
aVBut the research also shows that there's nothing that will 100 percent protect you.
p28
aVIf the monster wants you, the monster's gonna get you.
p29
aVThat's what happened with my dad.
p30
aVMy dad was a bilingual college professor. His hobbies were chess, bridge and writing op-eds.
p31
aV(Laughter)
p32
aVHe got dementia anyway.
p33
aVIf the monster wants you, the monster's gonna get you.
p34
aVEspecially if you're me, 'cause Alzheimer's tends to run in families.
p35
aVSo I'm preparing to get Alzheimer's disease.
p36
aa(lp37
VBased on what I've learned from taking care of my father,
p38
aVand researching what it's like to live with dementia, I'm focusing on three things in my preparation:
p39
aVI'm changing what I do for fun, I'm working to build my physical strength,
p40
aVand \u2014 this is the hard one \u2014 I'm trying to become a better person.
p41
aVLet's start with the hobbies. When you get dementia, it gets harder and harder to enjoy yourself.
p42
aVYou can't sit and have long talks with your old friends, because you don't know who they are.
p43
aVIt's confusing to watch television, and often very frightening.
p44
aVAnd reading is just about impossible.
p45
aVWhen you care for someone with dementia, and you get training,
p46
aVthey train you to engage them in activities that are familiar, hands-on, open-ended.
p47
aVWith my dad, that turned out to be letting him fill out forms.
p48
aVHe was a college professor at a state school; he knows what paperwork looks like.
p49
aVHe'll sign his name on every line, he'll check all the boxes,
p50
aVhe'll put numbers in where he thinks there should be numbers.
p51
aVBut it got me thinking, what would my caregivers do with me?
p52
aVI'm my father's daughter. I read, I write, I think about global health a lot.
p53
aVWould they give me academic journals so I could scribble in the margins?
p54
aVWould they give me charts and graphs that I could color?
p55
aVSo I've been trying to learn to do things that are hands-on.
p56
aVI've always liked to draw, so I'm doing it more even though I'm really very bad at it.
p57
aVI am learning some basic origami. I can make a really great box.
p58
aV(Laughter)
p59
aVAnd I'm teaching myself to knit, which so far I can knit a blob.
p60
aa(lp61
VBut, you know, it doesn't matter if I'm actually good at it. What matters is that my hands know how to do it.
p62
aVBecause the more things that are familiar, the more things my hands know how to do,
p63
aVthe more things that I can be happy and busy doing when my brain's not running the show anymore.
p64
aVThey say that people who are engaged in activities are happier,
p65
aVeasier for their caregivers to look after, and it may even slow the progress of the disease.
p66
aVThat all seems like win to me.
p67
aVI want to be as happy as I can for as long as I can.
p68
aVA lot of people don't know that Alzheimer's actually has physical symptoms,
p69
aVas well as cognitive symptoms. You lose your sense of balance,
p70
aVyou get muscle tremors, and that tends to lead people to being less and less mobile.
p71
aVThey get scared to walk around. They get scared to move.
p72
aVSo I'm doing activities that will build my sense of balance.
p73
aVI'm doing yoga and tai chi to improve my balance, so that when I start to lose it,
p74
aVI'll still be able to be mobile.
p75
aVI'm doing weight-bearing exercise, so that I have the muscle strength
p76
aVso that when I start to wither, I have more time that I can still move around.
p77
aa(lp78
VFinally, the third thing. I'm trying to become a better person.
p79
aVMy dad was kind and loving before he had Alzheimer's, and he's kind and loving now.
p80
aVI've seen him lose his intellect, his sense of humor, his language skills,
p81
aVbut I've also seen this: He loves me, he loves my sons,
p82
aVhe loves my brother and my mom and his caregivers.
p83
aVAnd that love makes us want to be around him, even now.
p84
aVeven when it's so hard.
p85
aVWhen you take away everything that he ever learned in this world,
p86
aVhis naked heart still shines.
p87
aVI was never as kind as my dad, and I was never as loving.
p88
aVAnd what I need now is to learn to be like that.
p89
aVI need a heart so pure that if it's stripped bare by dementia, it will survive.
p90
aa(lp91
VI don't want to get Alzheimer's disease.
p92
aVWhat I want is a cure in the next 20 years, soon enough to protect me.
p93
aVBut if it comes for me, I'm going to be ready.
p94
aVThank you.
