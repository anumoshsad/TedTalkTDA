VLet's begin with a story.
p4
aVOnce upon a time \u2014
p5
aVwell actually less than two years ago \u2014
p6
aVin a kingdom not so very far away,
p7
aVthere was a man
p8
aVwho traveled many miles
p9
aVto come to work at the jewel in the kingdom's crown \u2014
p10
aVan internationally famous company.
p11
aVLet's call it Island Networks.
p12
aVNow this kingdom had many resources
p13
aVand mighty ambitions,
p14
aVbut the one thing it lacked was people.
p15
aVAnd so it invited workers from around the world
p16
aVto come and help it build the nation.
p17
aVBut in order to enter and to stay
p18
aVthese migrants had to pass a few tests.
p19
aVAnd so it was, our man presented himself
p20
aVto authorities in the kingdom,
p21
aVlooking forward to settling into his new life.
p22
aa(lp23
VBut then something unexpected happened.
p24
aVThe medical personnel who took blood samples from the man
p25
aVnever actually told him what they were testing for.
p26
aVHe wasn't offered counseling before or after the test,
p27
aVwhich is best medical practice.
p28
aVHe was never informed of the results of the test.
p29
aVAnd yet, a couple of weeks later,
p30
aVhe was picked up and taken to prison
p31
aVwhere he was subjected to a medical exam,
p32
aVincluding a full-body search
p33
aVin full view of the others in the cell.
p34
aVHe was released, but then a day or two later,
p35
aVhe was taken to the airport and he was deported.
p36
aVWhat on earth did this man do
p37
aVto merit this treatment?
p38
aVWhat was his terrible crime?
p39
aVHe was infected with HIV.
p40
aa(lp41
VNow the kingdom is one of about 50 countries
p42
aVthat imposes restrictions on the entry or stay
p43
aVof people living with HIV.
p44
aVThe kingdom argues
p45
aVthat its laws allow it to detain or deport foreigners
p46
aVwho pose a risk to the economy
p47
aVor the security or the public health
p48
aVor the morals of the state.
p49
aVBut these laws, when applied to people living with HIV,
p50
aVare a violation of international human rights agreements
p51
aVto which these countries are signatories.
p52
aVBut you know what?
p53
aVMatters of principle aside,
p54
aVpractically speaking, these laws drive HIV underground.
p55
aVPeople are less likely to come forth
p56
aVto be tested or treated or to disclose their condition,
p57
aVnone of which helps these individuals
p58
aVor the communities these laws purport to protect.
p59
aa(lp60
VToday we can prevent the transmission of HIV.
p61
aVAnd with treatment, it is a manageable condition.
p62
aVWe are very far from the days
p63
aVwhen the only practical response to dread disease
p64
aVwas to have banished the afflicted \u2014
p65
aVlike this, "The Exile of the Leper."
p66
aVSo you tell me why, in our age of science,
p67
aVwe still have laws and policies
p68
aVwhich come from an age of superstition.
p69
aa(lp70
VTime for a quick show of hands.
p71
aVWho here has been touched by HIV \u2014
p72
aVeither because you yourself have the virus
p73
aVor you have a family member or a friend or a colleague
p74
aVwho is living with HIV?
p75
aVHands up.
p76
aVWow. Wow.
p77
aVThat's a significant number of us.
p78
aa(lp79
VYou know better than anyone
p80
aVthat HIV brings out
p81
aVthe best and the worst in humanity.
p82
aVAnd the laws reflect these attitudes.
p83
aVI'm not just talking about laws on the books,
p84
aVbut laws as they are enforced on the streets
p85
aVand laws as they are decided in the courts.
p86
aVAnd I'm not just talking about laws
p87
aVas they relate to people living with HIV,
p88
aVbut people who are at greatest risk of infection \u2014
p89
aVpeople such as those who inject drugs or sex workers
p90
aVor men who have sex with men
p91
aVor transgendered persons
p92
aVor migrants or prisoners.
p93
aVAnd in many parts of the world that includes women and children
p94
aVwho are especially vulnerable.
p95
aa(lp96
VNow there are laws in many parts of the world
p97
aVwhich reflect the best of human nature.
p98
aVThese laws treat people touched by HIV
p99
aVwith compassion and acceptance.
p100
aVThese laws respect universal human rights
p101
aVand they are grounded in evidence.
p102
aVThese laws ensure that people living with HIV
p103
aVand those at greatest risk
p104
aVare protected from violence and discrimination
p105
aVand that they get access to prevention and to treatment.
p106
aVUnfortunately, these good laws
p107
aVare counter-balanced by a mass
p108
aVof really bad law \u2014
p109
aVlaw which is grounded in moral judgement
p110
aVand in fear and in misinformation,
p111
aVlaws which specifically punish people living with HIV
p112
aVor those at greatest risk.
p113
aVThese laws fly in the face of science,
p114
aVand they are grounded in prejudice
p115
aVand in ignorance and in a rewriting of tradition
p116
aVand a selective reading of religion.
p117
aa(lp118
VBut you know what? You don't have to take my word for it.
p119
aVWe're going to hear from two people
p120
aVwho are on the sharp end of the law.
p121
aVThe first is Nick Rhoades. He's an American.
p122
aVAnd he was convicted under the U.S. State of Iowa's law
p123
aVon HIV transmission and exposure \u2014
p124
aVneither of which offense he actually committed.
p125
aa(lp126
V(Video) Nick Rhoades: If something is against the law
p127
aVthen that is telling society
p128
aVthat is unacceptable, that's bad behavior.
p129
aVAnd I think the severity of that punishment
p130
aVtells you how bad you are as a person.
p131
aVYou're a class B felon,
p132
aVlifetime sex offender.
p133
aVYou are a very, very, very bad person.
p134
aVAnd you did a very, very, very bad thing.
p135
aVAnd so that's just programmed into you.
p136
aVAnd you go through the correctional system
p137
aVand everyone's telling you the same thing.
p138
aVAnd you're just like, I'm a very bad person.
p139
aa(lp140
VShereen El-Feki: It's not just a question
p141
aVof unfair or ineffective laws.
p142
aVSome countries have good laws,
p143
aVlaws which could stem the tide of HIV.
p144
aVThe problem is that these laws are flouted.
p145
aVBecause stigma gives unofficial license
p146
aVto treat people living with HIV
p147
aVor those at greatest risk
p148
aVunlike other citizens.
p149
aVAnd this is exactly what happened
p150
aVto Helma and Dongo from Namibia.
p151
aa(lp152
V(Video) Hilma: I found out
p153
aVwhen I went to the hospital for a pregnancy check-up.
p154
aVThe nurse announced that every pregnant woman
p155
aVmust also be tested for HIV that day.
p156
aVI took the test and the result showed I was positive.
p157
aVThat's the day I found out.
p158
aVThe nurse said to me, "Why should you people bcome pregnant
p159
aVwhen you know you are HIV positive?
p160
aVWhy are you pregnant when you are living positive?"
p161
aVI am sure now that is the reason they sterilized me.
p162
aVBecause I am HIV positive.
p163
aVThey didn't give the forms to me
p164
aVor explain what was in the form.
p165
aVThe nurse just came with it
p166
aValready marked where I had to sign.
p167
aVAnd with the labor pain,
p168
aVI didn't have the strength to ask them to read it to me.
p169
aVI just signed.
p170
aa(lp171
VSE: Hilma and Nick and our man in the kingdom
p172
aVare among the 34 million people living with HIV
p173
aVaccording to recent estimates.
p174
aVThey're the lucky ones
p175
aVbecause they're still alive.
p176
aVAccording to those same estimates,
p177
aVin 2010 1.8 million people died
p178
aVof AIDS related causes.
p179
aVThese are terrible and tragic figures.
p180
aVBut if we look a little more broadly into the statistics,
p181
aVwe actually see some reason for hope.
p182
aa(lp183
VLooking globally, the number of new infections of HIV is declining.
p184
aVAnd looking globally as well,
p185
aVdeaths are also starting to fall.
p186
aVThere are many reasons for these positive developments,
p187
aVbut one of the most remarkable
p188
aVis in the increase in the number of people around the world
p189
aVon anti-retroviral therapy,
p190
aVthe medicines they need to keep their HIV in check.
p191
aa(lp192
VNow there are still many problems.
p193
aVOnly about half of the people who need treatment
p194
aVare currently receiving it.
p195
aVIn some parts of the world \u2014
p196
aVlike here in the Middle East and North Africa \u2014
p197
aVnew infections are rising and so are deaths.
p198
aVAnd the money, the money we need
p199
aVfor the global response to HIV,
p200
aVthat is shrinking.
p201
aVBut for the first time
p202
aVin three decades into this epidemic
p203
aVwe have a real chance to come to grips with HIV.
p204
aVBut in order to do that
p205
aVwe need to tackle an epidemic of really bad law.
p206
aa(lp207
VIt's for this reason
p208
aVthat the Global Commission on HIV and the Law,
p209
aVof which I'm a member,
p210
aVwas established by the agencies of the United Nations \u2014
p211
aVto look at the ways that legal environments
p212
aVare affecting people living with HIV
p213
aVand those at greatest risk,
p214
aVand to recommend what should be done
p215
aVto make the law an ally, not an enemy,
p216
aVof the global response to HIV.
p217
aa(lp218
VLet me give you just one example
p219
aVof the way a legal environment
p220
aVcan make a positive difference.
p221
aVPeople who inject drugs
p222
aVare one of those groups I mentioned.
p223
aVThey're at high risk of HIV
p224
aVthrough contaminated injection equipment
p225
aVand other risk-related behaviors.
p226
aVIn fact, one in every 10 new infections of HIV
p227
aVis among people who inject drugs.
p228
aVNow drug use or possession
p229
aVis illegal in almost every country.
p230
aVBut some countries take a harder line on this than others.
p231
aa(lp232
VIn Thailand people who use drugs,
p233
aVor are merely suspected of using drugs,
p234
aVare placed in detention centers,
p235
aVlike the one you see here,
p236
aVwhere they are supposed to clean up.
p237
aVThere is absolutely no evidence
p238
aVto show that throwing people into detention
p239
aVcures their drug dependence.
p240
aVThere is, however, ample evidence
p241
aVto show that incarcerating people
p242
aVincreases their risk of HIV and other infections.
p243
aa(lp244
VWe know how to reduce HIV transmission and other risks
p245
aVin people who inject drugs.
p246
aVIt's called harm reduction,
p247
aVand it involves, among other things,
p248
aVproviding clean needles and syringes,
p249
aVoffering opioid substitution therapy
p250
aVand other evidence-based treatments
p251
aVto reduce drug dependence.
p252
aVIt involves providing information
p253
aVand education and condoms
p254
aVto reduce HIV transmission,
p255
aVand also providing HIV testing
p256
aVand counseling and treatment
p257
aVshould people become infected.
p258
aVWhere the legal environment allows for harm reduction
p259
aVthe results are striking.
p260
aa(lp261
VAustralia and Switzerland
p262
aVwere two countries which introduced harm reduction
p263
aVvery early on in their HIV epidemics,
p264
aVand they have a very low rate of HIV
p265
aVamong injecting drug users.
p266
aVThe U.S. and Malaysia
p267
aVcame to harm reduction a little later,
p268
aVand they have higher rates of HIV in these populations.
p269
aVThailand and Russia, however,
p270
aVhave resisted harm reduction
p271
aVand have stringent laws
p272
aVwhich punish drug use.
p273
aVAnd hey, surprise,
p274
aVvery high rates of HIV among people who are injecting drugs.
p275
aa(lp276
VAt the Global Commission we have studied the evidence,
p277
aVand we've heard the experiences
p278
aVof over 700 people from 140 countries.
p279
aVAnd the trend? Well the trend is clear.
p280
aVWhere you criminalize people living with HIV
p281
aVor those at greatest risk,
p282
aVyou fuel the epidemic.
p283
aVNow coming up with a vaccine for HIV
p284
aVor a cure for AIDS \u2014
p285
aVnow that's rocket science.
p286
aVBut changing the law isn't.
p287
aVAnd in fact, a number of countries are starting to make progress
p288
aVon a number of points.
p289
aVTo begin, countries need to review their legislation
p290
aVas it touches HIV and vulnerable groups.
p291
aVOn the back of those reviews,
p292
aVgovernments should repeal laws
p293
aVthat punish or discriminate against people living with HIV
p294
aVor those at greatest risk.
p295
aa(lp296
VRepealing a law isn't easy,
p297
aVand it's particularly difficult
p298
aVwhen it relates to touchy subjects like drugs and sex.
p299
aVBut there's plenty you can do while that process is underway.
p300
aVOne of the key points is to reform the police
p301
aVso that they have better practices on the ground.
p302
aVSo for example, outreach workers
p303
aVwho are distributing condoms to vulnerable populations
p304
aVare not themselves subject to police harassment
p305
aVor abuse or arbitrary arrest.
p306
aVWe can also train judges
p307
aVso that they find flexibilities in the law
p308
aVand so that they rule on the side of tolerance
p309
aVrather than prejudice.
p310
aVWe can retool prisons
p311
aVso that HIV prevention and harm reduction
p312
aVis available to prisoners.
p313
aa(lp314
VThe key to all this is reinforcing civil society.
p315
aVBecause civil society is key
p316
aVto raising awareness among vulnerable groups
p317
aVof their legal rights.
p318
aVBut awareness needs action.
p319
aVAnd so we need to ensure
p320
aVthat these people who are living with HIV
p321
aVor at greatest risk of HIV
p322
aVhave access to legal services
p323
aVand they have equal access to the courts.
p324
aVAnd also important is talking to communities
p325
aVso that we change interpretations
p326
aVof religious or customary law,
p327
aVwhich is too often used
p328
aVto justify punishment and fuel stigma.
p329
aa(lp330
VFor many of us here
p331
aVHIV is not an abstract threat.
p332
aVIt hits very close to home.
p333
aVThe law, on the other hand,
p334
aVcan seem remote, arcane, the stuff of specialists,
p335
aVbut it isn't.
p336
aVBecause for those of us who live in democracies,
p337
aVor in aspiring democracies,
p338
aVthe law begins with us.
p339
aa(lp340
VLaws that treat people living with HIV
p341
aVor those at greatest risk with respect
p342
aVstart with the way that we treat them ourselves: as equals.
p343
aVIf we are going to stop the spread of HIV in our lifetime,
p344
aVthen that is the change we need to spread.
p345
aa(lp346
