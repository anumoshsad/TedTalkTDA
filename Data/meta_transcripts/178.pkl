VIn the next 18 minutes, I'm going to take you on a journey.
p4
aVAnd it's a journey that you and I have been on for many years now,
p5
aVand it began some 50 years ago, when humans first stepped off our planet.
p6
aVAnd in those 50 years, not only did we literally, physically set foot on the moon,
p7
aVbut we have dispatched robotic spacecraft to all the planets \u2014 all eight of them \u2014
p8
aVand we have landed on asteroids, we have rendezvoused with comets,
p9
aVand, at this point in time, we have a spacecraft on its way to Pluto,
p10
aVthe body formerly known as a planet.
p11
aVAnd all of these robotic missions are part of a bigger human journey:
p12
aVa voyage to understand something, to get a sense of our cosmic place,
p13
aVto understand something of our origins, and how Earth, our planet,
p14
aVand we, living on it, came to be.
p15
aa(lp16
VAnd of all the places in the solar system that we might go to
p17
aVand search for answers to questions like this,
p18
aVthere's Saturn. And we have been to Saturn before \u2014
p19
aVwe visited Saturn in the early 1980s \u2014
p20
aVbut our investigations of Saturn have become far more in-depth in detail
p21
aVsince the Cassini spacecraft, traveling across interplanetary space
p22
aVfor seven years, glided into orbit around Saturn in the summer of 2004,
p23
aVand became at that point the farthest robotic outpost
p24
aVthat humanity had ever established around the Sun.
p25
aa(lp26
VNow, the Saturn system is a rich planetary system.
p27
aVIt offers mystery, scientific insight and obviously splendor beyond compare,
p28
aVand the investigation of this system has enormous cosmic reach.
p29
aVIn fact, just studying the rings alone, we stand to learn a lot
p30
aVabout the discs of stars and gas that we call the spiral galaxies.
p31
aVAnd here's a beautiful picture of the Andromeda Nebula,
p32
aVwhich is our closest, largest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way.
p33
aVAnd then, here's a beautiful composite of the Whirlpool Galaxy,
p34
aVtaken by the Hubble Space Telescope.
p35
aa(lp36
VSo the journey back to Saturn is really part of and is also a metaphor
p37
aVfor a much larger human voyage
p38
aVto understand the interconnectedness of everything around us,
p39
aVand also how humans fit into that picture.
p40
aVAnd it pains me that I can't tell you all that we have learned with Cassini.
p41
aVI can't show you all the beautiful pictures that we've taken
p42
aVin the last two and a half years, because I simply don't have the time.
p43
aVSo I'm going to concentrate on two of the most exciting stories
p44
aVthat have emerged out of this major exploratory expedition
p45
aVthat we are conducting around Saturn,
p46
aVand have been for the past two and a half years.
p47
aa(lp48
VSaturn is accompanied by a very large and diverse collection of moons.
p49
aVThey range in size from a few kilometers across to as big across as the U.S.
p50
aVMost of the beautiful pictures we've taken of Saturn, in fact,
p51
aVshow Saturn in accompaniment with some of its moons. Here's Saturn with Dione,
p52
aVand then, here's Saturn showing the rings edge-on,
p53
aVshowing you just how vertically thin they are, with the moon Enceladus.
p54
aVNow, two of the 47 moons that Saturn has are standouts.
p55
aa(lp56
VAnd those are Titan and Enceladus. Titan is Saturn's largest moon,
p57
aVand, until Cassini had arrived there,
p58
aVwas the largest single expanse of unexplored terrain
p59
aVthat we had remaining in our solar system.
p60
aVAnd it is a body that has long intrigued people who've watched the planets.
p61
aVIt has a very large, thick atmosphere,
p62
aVand in fact, its surface environment was believed to be
p63
aVmore like the environment we have here on the Earth,
p64
aVor at least had in the past, than any other body in the solar system.
p65
aVIts atmosphere is largely molecular nitrogen, like you are breathing here in this room,
p66
aVexcept that its atmosphere is suffused with
p67
aVsimple organic materials like methane and propane and ethane.
p68
aVAnd these molecules high up in the atmosphere of Titan
p69
aVget broken down, and their products join together to make haze particles.
p70
aVThis haze is ubiquitous. It's completely global and enveloping Titan.
p71
aVAnd that's why you cannot see down to the surface
p72
aVwith our eyes in the visible region of the spectrum.
p73
aa(lp74
VBut these haze particles, it was surmised,
p75
aVbefore we got there with Cassini, over billions and billions of years,
p76
aVgently drifted down to the surface and coated the surface
p77
aVin a thick organic sludge.
p78
aVSo like the equivalent, the Titan equivalent, of tar, or oil, or what \u2014 we didn't know what.
p79
aVBut this is what we suspected. And these molecules,
p80
aVespecially methane and ethane, can be liquids at the surface temperatures of Titan.
p81
aVAnd so it turns out that methane is to Titan what water is to the Earth.
p82
aVIt's a condensable in the atmosphere,
p83
aVand so recognizing this circumstance brought to the fore
p84
aVa whole world of bizarre possibilities. You can have methane clouds, OK,
p85
aVand above those clouds, you have this hundreds of kilometers of haze,
p86
aVwhich prevent any sunlight from getting to the surface.
p87
aVThe temperature at the surface is some 350 degrees below zero Fahrenheit.
p88
aa(lp89
VBut despite that cold, you could have rain falling down on the surface of Titan.
p90
aVAnd doing on Titan what rain does on the Earth: it carves gullies; it forms rivers
p91
aVand cataracts; it can create canyons; it can pool in large basins and craters.
p92
aVIt can wash the sludge off high mountain peaks and hills,
p93
aVdown into the lowlands. So stop and think for a minute.
p94
aVTry to imagine what the surface of Titan might look like.
p95
aVIt's dark. High noon on Titan is as dark as deep earth twilight on the Earth.
p96
aVIt's cold, it's eerie, it's misty,
p97
aVit might be raining, and you might be standing
p98
aVon the shores of Lake Michigan brimming with paint thinner. (Laughter)
p99
aa(lp100
VThat is the view that we had of the surface of Titan before we got there with Cassini,
p101
aVand I can tell you that what we have found on Titan, though it is not the same in detail,
p102
aVis every bit as fascinating as that story is.
p103
aVAnd for us, it has been like \u2014 the Cassini people \u2014
p104
aVit has been like a Jules Verne adventure come true.
p105
aVAs I said, it has a thick, extensive atmosphere.
p106
aVThis is a picture of Titan, backlit by the Sun, with the rings as a beautiful backdrop.
p107
aVAnd yet another moon there \u2014
p108
aVI don't even know which one it is. It's a very extensive atmosphere.
p109
aVWe have instruments on Cassini which can see down to the surface
p110
aVthrough this atmosphere, and my camera system is one of them.
p111
aVAnd we have taken pictures like this.
p112
aVAnd what you see is bright and dark regions, and that's about as far as it got for us.
p113
aVIt was so mystifying: we couldn't make out what we were seeing on Titan.
p114
aVWhen you look closer at this region, you start to see things
p115
aVlike sinuous channels \u2014 we didn't know. You see a few round things.
p116
aVThis, we later found out, is, in fact, a crater,
p117
aVbut there are very few craters on the surface of Titan,
p118
aVmeaning it's a very young surface.
p119
aVAnd there are features that look tectonic.
p120
aVThey look like they've been pulled apart.
p121
aVWhenever you see anything linear on a planet,
p122
aVit means there's been a fracture, like a fault.
p123
aVAnd so it's been tectonically altered.
p124
aa(lp125
VBut we couldn't make sense of our images,
p126
aVuntil, six months after we got into orbit,
p127
aVan event occurred that many have regarded
p128
aVas the highlight of Cassini's investigation of Titan.
p129
aVAnd that was the deployment of the Huygens probe,
p130
aVthe European-built Huygens probe that Cassini had carried
p131
aVfor seven years across the solar system. We deployed it to the atmosphere of Titan,
p132
aVit took two and a half hours to descend, and it landed on the surface.
p133
aVAnd I just want to emphasize how significant an event this is.
p134
aVThis is a device of human making,
p135
aVand it landed in the outer solar system for the first time in human history.
p136
aVIt is so significant that, in my mind,
p137
aVthis was an event that should have been celebrated
p138
aVwith ticker tape parades in every city across the U.S. and Europe,
p139
aVand sadly, that wasn't the case.
p140
aV(Laughter).
p141
aa(lp142
VIt was significant for another reason. This is an international mission,
p143
aVand this event was celebrated in Europe, in Germany,
p144
aVand the celebratory presentations were given in English accents,
p145
aVand American accents, and German accents, and French and Italian and Dutch accents.
p146
aVIt was a moving demonstration of what the words
p147
aV"united nations" are supposed to mean:
p148
aVa true union of nations joined together in a colossal effort for good.
p149
aVAnd, in this case, it was a massive undertaking to explore a planet,
p150
aVand to come to understand a planetary system
p151
aVthat, for all of human history, had been unreachable,
p152
aVand now humans had actually touched it.
p153
aVSo it was \u2014 I mean, I'm getting goose bumps just talking about it.
p154
aVIt was a tremendously emotional event,
p155
aVand it's something that I will personally never forget, and you shouldn't either.
p156
aV(Applause).
p157
aa(lp158
VBut anyway, the probe took measurements of the atmosphere on the way down,
p159
aVand it also took panoramic pictures.
p160
aVAnd I can't tell you what it was like to see the first pictures
p161
aVof Titan's surface from the probe. And this is what we saw.
p162
aVAnd it was a shocker, because it was everything we wanted
p163
aVthose other pictures taken from orbit to be.
p164
aVIt was an unambiguous pattern, a geological pattern.
p165
aVIt's a dendritic drainage pattern that can be formed only by the flow of liquids.
p166
aVAnd you can follow these channels
p167
aVand you can see how they all converge.
p168
aVAnd they converge into this channel here, which drains into this region.
p169
aVYou are looking at a shoreline.
p170
aVWas this a shoreline of fluids? We didn't know.
p171
aVBut this is somewhat of a shoreline.
p172
aa(lp173
VThis picture is taken at 16 kilometers.
p174
aVThis is the picture taken at eight kilometers, OK? Again, the shoreline.
p175
aVOkay, now, 16 kilometers, eight kilometers \u2014 this is roughly an airline altitude.
p176
aVIf you were going to take an airplane trip across the U.S.,
p177
aVyou would be flying at these altitudes.
p178
aVSo, this is the picture you would have at the window of Titanian Airlines
p179
aVas you fly across the surface of Titan. (Laughter)
p180
aa(lp181
VAnd then finally, the probe came to rest on the surface,
p182
aVand I'm going to show you, ladies and gentlemen,
p183
aVthe first picture ever taken from the surface of a moon in the outer solar system.
p184
aVAnd here is the horizon, OK?
p185
aVThese are probably water ice pebbles, yes?
p186
aV(Applause).
p187
aVAnd obviously, it landed in one of these flat, dark regions
p188
aVand it didn't sink out of sight. So it wasn't fluid that we landed in.
p189
aVWhat the probe came down in was basically
p190
aVthe Titan equivalent of a mud flat.
p191
aVThis is an unconsolidated ground that is suffused with liquid methane.
p192
aVAnd it's probably the case that this material
p193
aVhas washed off the highlands of Titan
p194
aVthrough these channels that we saw,
p195
aVand has drained over billions of years to fill in low-lying basins.
p196
aVAnd that is what the Huygens probe landed in.
p197
aa(lp198
VBut still, there was no sign in our images,
p199
aVor even in the Huygens' images, of any large, open bodies of fluids.
p200
aVWhere were they? It got even more puzzling when we found dunes.
p201
aVOK, so this is our movie of the equatorial region of Titan,
p202
aVshowing these dunes. These are dunes that are 100 meters tall,
p203
aVseparated by a few kilometers,
p204
aVand they go on for miles and miles and miles.
p205
aVThere's hundreds, up to a 1,000 or 1,200 miles of dunes.
p206
aVThis is the Saharan desert of Titan.
p207
aVIt's obviously a place which is very dry, or you wouldn't get dunes.
p208
aa(lp209
VSo again, it got puzzling that there were no bodies of fluid,
p210
aVuntil finally, we saw lakes in the polar regions.
p211
aVAnd there is a lake scene in the south polar region of Titan.
p212
aVIt's about the size of Lake Ontario.
p213
aVAnd then, only a week and a half ago,
p214
aVwe flew over the north pole of Titan and found, again,
p215
aVwe found a feature here the size of the Caspian Sea.
p216
aVSo it seems that the liquids, for some reason we don't understand,
p217
aVor during at least this season, are apparently at the poles of Titan.
p218
aVAnd I think you would agree that we have found Titan
p219
aVis a remarkable, mystical place. It's exotic, it's alien, but yet strangely Earth-like,
p220
aVand having Earth-like geological formations
p221
aVand a tremendous geographical diversity,
p222
aVand is a fascinating world whose only rival in the solar system
p223
aVfor complexity and richness is the Earth itself.
p224
aa(lp225
VAnd so now we go onto Enceladus. Enceladus is a small moon,
p226
aVit's about a tenth the size of Titan. And you can see it here next to England,
p227
aVjust to show you the size. This is not meant to be a threat.
p228
aV(Laughter).
p229
aVAnd Enceladus is very white, it's very bright,
p230
aVand its surface is obviously wrecked with fractures.
p231
aVIt is a very geologically active body.
p232
aVBut the mother lode of discoveries on Enceladus
p233
aVwas found at the south pole \u2014 and we're looking at the south pole here \u2014
p234
aVwhere we found this system of fractures.
p235
aVAnd they're a different color because they're a different composition.
p236
aVThey are coated. These fractures are coated with organic materials.
p237
aVMoreover, this whole, entire region, the south polar region,
p238
aVhas elevated temperatures. It's the hottest place on the planet, on the body.
p239
aVThat's as bizarre as finding that the Antarctic on the Earth is hotter than the tropics.
p240
aa(lp241
VAnd then, when we took additional pictures, we discovered
p242
aVthat from these fractures are issuing jets of fine, icy particles
p243
aVextending hundreds of miles into space.
p244
aVAnd when we color-code this image, to bring out the faint light levels,
p245
aVwe see that these jets feed a plume
p246
aVthat, in fact, we see, in other images, goes thousands of miles
p247
aVinto the space above Enceladus.
p248
aVMy team and I have examined images like this,
p249
aVand like this one, and have thought about the other results from Cassini.
p250
aVAnd we have arrived at the conclusion
p251
aVthat these jets may be erupting from pockets
p252
aVof liquid water under the surface of Enceladus.
p253
aa(lp254
VSo we have, possibly, liquid water, organic materials and excess heat.
p255
aVIn other words, we have possibly stumbled upon
p256
aVthe holy grail of modern day planetary exploration,
p257
aVor in other words, an environment that is potentially suitable for living organisms.
p258
aVAnd I don't think I need to tell you that the discovery of life
p259
aVelsewhere in our solar system,
p260
aVwhether it be on Enceladus or elsewhere,
p261
aVwould have enormous cultural and scientific implications.
p262
aVBecause if we could demonstrate that genesis had occurred
p263
aVnot once, but twice, independently, in our solar system,
p264
aVthen that means, by inference, it has occurred a staggering number of times
p265
aVthroughout the universe and its 13.7 billion year history.
p266
aa(lp267
VRight now, Earth is the only planet still that we know is teeming with life.
p268
aVIt is precious, it is unique,
p269
aVit is still, so far, the only home we've ever known.
p270
aVAnd if any of you were alert and coherent during the 1960s \u2014
p271
aVand we'd forgive you, if you weren't, OK \u2014
p272
aVyou would remember this very famous picture
p273
aVtaken by the Apollo 8 astronauts in 1968.
p274
aVIt was the first time that Earth was imaged from space,
p275
aVand it had an enormous impact on our sense of place in the universe,
p276
aVand our sense of responsibility for the protection of our own planet.
p277
aa(lp278
VWell, we on Cassini have taken an equivalent first,
p279
aVa picture that no human eye has ever seen before.
p280
aVIt is a total eclipse of the Sun, seen from the other side of Saturn.
p281
aVAnd in this impossibly beautiful picture,
p282
aVyou see the main rings backlit by the Sun,
p283
aVyou see the refracted image of the Sun
p284
aVand you see this ring created, in fact,
p285
aVby the exhalations of Enceladus.
p286
aVBut as if that weren't brilliant enough, we can spot, in this beautiful image,
p287
aVsight of our own planet,
p288
aVcradled in the arms of Saturn's rings.
p289
aa(lp290
VNow, there is something deeply moving
p291
aVabout seeing ourselves from afar,
p292
aVand capturing the sight of our little, blue-ocean planet
p293
aVin the skies of other worlds.
p294
aVAnd that, and the perspective of ourselves that we gain from that,
p295
aVmay be, in the end, the finest reward that we earn
p296
aVfrom this journey of discovery that started half a century ago.
p297
aVAnd thank you very much.
