VThe decorative use of wire in southern Africa
p4
aVdates back hundreds of years.
p5
aVBut modernization actually brought communication
p6
aVand a whole new material, in the form of telephone wire.
p7
aVRural to urban migration meant that newfound industrial materials
p8
aVstarted to replace hard-to-come-by natural grasses.
p9
aa(lp10
VSo, here you can see the change
p11
aVfrom use \u2014 starting to use contemporary materials.
p12
aVThese pieces date back from the '40s to the late '50s.
p13
aVIn the '90s, my interest and passion for transitional art forms
p14
aVled me to a new form,
p15
aVwhich came from a squatter camp outside Durban.
p16
aa(lp17
VAnd I got the opportunity to start working with this community
p18
aVat that point, and started developing, really,
p19
aVand mentoring them in terms of scale, in terms of the design.
p20
aVAnd the project soon grew from five to 50 weavers in about a year.
p21
aVSoon we had outgrown the scrap yards, what they could provide,
p22
aVso we coerced a wire manufacturer to help us,
p23
aVand not only to supply the materials on bobbins,
p24
aVbut to produce to our color specifications.
p25
aa(lp26
VAt the same time, I was thinking, well,
p27
aVthere's lots of possibility here to produce contemporary products,
p28
aVaway from the ethnic, a little bit more contemporary.
p29
aVSo I developed a whole range around \u2014 mass-produced range \u2014
p30
aVthat obviously fitted into a much higher-end decor market
p31
aVthat could be exported and also service our local market.
p32
aa(lp33
VWe started experimenting, as you can see, in terms of shapes,
p34
aVforms. The scale became very important,
p35
aVand it's become our pet project. It's successful,
p36
aVit's been running for 12 years. And we supply the Conran shops,
p37
aVand Donna Karan, and so it's kind of great.
p38
aa(lp39
VThis is our group, our main group of weavers.
p40
aVThey come on a weekly basis to Durban.
p41
aVThey all have bank accounts.
p42
aVThey've all moved back to the rural area where they came from.
p43
aVIt's a weekly turnaround of production.
p44
aVThis is the community that I originally showed you the slide of.
p45
aVAnd that's also modernized today,
p46
aVand it's supporting work for 300 weavers.
p47
aVAnd the rest says it all.
p48
aa(lp49
VThank you very much.
