VIt was an afternoon in the fall of 2005.
p4
aVI was working at the ACLU as the organization's science advisor.
p5
aVI really, really loved my job,
p6
aVbut I was having one of those days
p7
aVwhere I was feeling just a little bit discouraged.
p8
aa(lp9
VSo I wandered down the hallway to my colleague Chris Hansen's office.
p10
aVChris had been at the ACLU for more than 30 years,
p11
aVso he had deep institutional knowledge and insights.
p12
aa(lp13
VI explained to Chris that I was feeling a little bit stuck.
p14
aVI had been investigating a number of issues
p15
aVat the intersection of science and civil liberties \u2014 super interesting.
p16
aVBut I wanted the ACLU to engage these issues in a much bigger way,
p17
aVin a way that could really make a difference.
p18
aa(lp19
VSo Chris cut right to the chase, and he says,
p20
aV"Well, of all the issues you've been looking at, what are the top five?"
p21
aa(lp22
V"Well, there's genetic discrimination,
p23
aVand reproductive technologies,
p24
aVand biobanking, and ...
p25
aVoh, there's this really cool issue,
p26
aVfunctional MRI and using it for lie detection, and ...
p27
aVoh, and of course, there's gene patents."
p28
aa(lp29
V"Gene patents?"
p30
aa(lp31
V"Yes, you know, patents on human genes."
p32
aa(lp33
V"No!
p34
aVYou're telling me that the US government
p35
aVhas been issuing patents on part of the human body?
p36
aVThat can't be right."
p37
aa(lp38
VI went back to my office and sent Chris three articles.
p39
aVAnd 20 minutes later, he came bursting in my office.
p40
aV"Oh my god! You're right! Who can we sue?"
p41
aa(lp42
V(Laughter)
p43
aa(lp44
VNow Chris is a really brilliant lawyer,
p45
aVbut he knew almost nothing about patent law
p46
aVand certainly nothing about genetics.
p47
aVI knew something about genetics, but I wasn't even a lawyer,
p48
aVlet alone a patent lawyer.
p49
aVSo clearly we had a lot to learn before we could file a lawsuit.
p50
aa(lp51
VFirst, we needed to understand exactly what was patented
p52
aVwhen someone patented a gene.
p53
aVGene patents typically contain dozens of claims,
p54
aVbut the most controversial of these are to so-called "isolated DNA" \u2014
p55
aVnamely, a piece of DNA that has been removed from a cell.
p56
aa(lp57
VGene patent proponents say,
p58
aV"See? We didn't patent the gene in your body,
p59
aVwe patented an isolated gene."
p60
aVAnd that's true,
p61
aVbut the problem is that any use of the gene requires that it be isolated.
p62
aVAnd the patents weren't just to a particular gene that they isolated,
p63
aVbut on every possible version of that gene.
p64
aa(lp65
VSo what does that mean?
p66
aa(lp67
VThat means that you can't give your gene to your doctor
p68
aVand ask him or her to look at it,
p69
aVsay, to see if it has any mutations,
p70
aVwithout permission of the patent holder.
p71
aVIt also means that the patent holder has the right to stop anyone
p72
aVfrom using that gene in research or clinical testing.
p73
aVAllowing patent holders,
p74
aVoften private companies,
p75
aVto lock up stretches of the human genome was harming patients.
p76
aa(lp77
VConsider Abigail,
p78
aVa 10-year-old with long QT syndrome,
p79
aVa serious heart condition that, if left untreated,
p80
aVcan result in sudden death.
p81
aVThe company that obtained a patent on two genes associated with this condition
p82
aVdeveloped a test to diagnose the syndrome.
p83
aVBut then they went bankrupt and they never offered it.
p84
aVSo another lab tried to offer the test,
p85
aVbut the company that held the patents threatened to sue the lab
p86
aVfor patent infringement.
p87
aVSo as a result,
p88
aVfor 2 years, no test was available.
p89
aVDuring that time,
p90
aVAbigail died of undiagnosed long QT.
p91
aa(lp92
VGene patents clearly were a problem and were harming patients.
p93
aVBut was there a way we could challenge them?
p94
aa(lp95
VTurns out that the Supreme Court
p96
aVhas made clear through a long line of cases,
p97
aVthat certain things are not patent eligible.
p98
aVYou can't patent products of nature \u2014
p99
aVthe air, the water, minerals, elements of the periodic table.
p100
aVAnd you can't patent laws of nature \u2014
p101
aVthe law of gravity, E = mc2.
p102
aVThese things are just too fundamental and must remain free to all
p103
aVand reserved exclusively to none.
p104
aa(lp105
VIt seemed to us that DNA,
p106
aVthe most fundamental structure of life,
p107
aVthat codes for the production of all of our proteins,
p108
aVis both a product of nature and a law of nature,
p109
aVregardless of whether it's in our bodies
p110
aVor sitting in the bottom of a test tube.
p111
aa(lp112
VAs we delved into this issue,
p113
aVwe traveled all over the country to speak with many different experts \u2014
p114
aVscientists, medical professionals, lawyers, patent lawyers.
p115
aVMost of them agreed that we were right as a matter of policy,
p116
aVand, at least in theory, as a matter of law.
p117
aVAll of them thought
p118
aVour chances of winning a gene-patent challenge
p119
aVwere about zero.
p120
aa(lp121
VWhy is that?
p122
aVWell, the patent office had been issuing these patents
p123
aVfor more than 20 years.
p124
aVThere were literally thousands of patents on human genes.
p125
aVThe patent bar was deeply entrenched in the status quo,
p126
aVthe biotech industry had grown up around this practice,
p127
aVand legislation to ban gene patents had been introduced
p128
aVyear after year in Congress,
p129
aVand had gone absolutely nowhere.
p130
aVSo the bottom line:
p131
aVcourts just weren't going to be willing to overturn these patents.
p132
aa(lp133
VNow, neither Chris nor I were the type to shy away from a challenge,
p134
aVand hearing, "Being right just isn't enough,"
p135
aVseemed all the more reason to take on this fight.
p136
aVSo we set out to build our case.
p137
aa(lp138
VNow, patent cases tend to be: Company A sues Company B
p139
aVover some really narrow, obscure technical issue.
p140
aVWe weren't really interested in that kind of case,
p141
aVand we thought this case was much bigger than that.
p142
aVThis was about scientific freedom, medical progress,
p143
aVthe rights of patients.
p144
aVSo we decided we were going to develop a case
p145
aVthat was not like your typical patent case \u2014
p146
aVmore like a civil rights case.
p147
aa(lp148
VWe set out to identify a gene-patent holder
p149
aVthat was vigorously enforcing its patents
p150
aVand then to organize a broad coalition of plaintiffs and experts
p151
aVthat could tell the court
p152
aVabout all the ways that these patents were harming patients and innovation.
p153
aa(lp154
VWe found the prime candidate to sue in Myriad Genetics,
p155
aVa company that's based in Salt Lake City, Utah.
p156
aVMyriad held patents on two genes,
p157
aVthe BRCA1 and the BRCA2 genes.
p158
aVWomen with certain mutations along these genes
p159
aVare considered to be at a significantly increased risk
p160
aVof developing breast and ovarian cancer.
p161
aVMyriad had used its patents to maintain
p162
aVa complete monopoly on BRCA testing in the United States.
p163
aVIt had forced multiple labs that were offering BRCA testing to stop.
p164
aVIt charged a lot of money for its test \u2014
p165
aVover 3,000 dollars.
p166
aVIt had stopped sharing its clinical data
p167
aVwith the international scientific community.
p168
aVAnd perhaps worst of all,
p169
aVfor a period of several years,
p170
aVMyriad refused to update its test to include additional mutations
p171
aVthat had been identified by a team of researchers in France.
p172
aa(lp173
VIt has been estimated that during that period,
p174
aVfor several years,
p175
aVas many as 12 percent of women undergoing testing
p176
aVreceived the wrong answer \u2014
p177
aVa negative test result that should have been positive.
p178
aa(lp179
VThis is Kathleen Maxian.
p180
aVKathleen's sister Eileen developed breast cancer at age 40
p181
aVand she was tested by Myriad.
p182
aVThe test was negative.
p183
aVThe family was relieved.
p184
aVThat meant that Eileen's cancer most likely didn't run in the family,
p185
aVand that other members of her family didn't need to be tested.
p186
aVBut two years later,
p187
aVKathleen was diagnosed with advanced-stage ovarian cancer.
p188
aVIt turned out that Kathleen's sister was among the 12 percent
p189
aVwho received a false-negative test result.
p190
aVHad Eileen received the proper result,
p191
aVKathleen would have then been tested,
p192
aVand her ovarian cancer could have been prevented.
p193
aa(lp194
VOnce we settled on Myriad,
p195
aVwe then had to form a coalition of plaintiffs and experts
p196
aVthat could illuminate these problems.
p197
aVWe ended up with 20 highly committed plaintiffs:
p198
aVgenetic counselors,
p199
aVgeneticists who had received cease and desist letters,
p200
aVadvocacy organizations,
p201
aVfour major scientific organizations that collectively represented
p202
aVmore than 150,000 scientists and medical professionals,
p203
aVand individual women who either couldn't afford Myriad's test,
p204
aVor who wanted to obtain a second opinion but could not,
p205
aVas a result of the patents.
p206
aa(lp207
VOne of the major challenges we had in preparing the case
p208
aVwas figuring out how best to communicate the science.
p209
aVSo in order to argue that what Myriad did was not an invention,
p210
aVand that isolated BRCA genes were products of nature,
p211
aVwe had to explain a couple of basic concepts, like:
p212
aVWhat's a gene? What's DNA?
p213
aVHow is DNA isolated, and why isn't that an invention?
p214
aa(lp215
VWe spent hours and hours with our plaintiffs and experts,
p216
aVtrying to come up with ways of explaining these concepts
p217
aVsimply yet accurately.
p218
aVAnd we ended up relying heavily on the use of metaphors,
p219
aVlike gold.
p220
aa(lp221
VSo isolating DNA \u2014
p222
aVit's like extracting gold from a mountain
p223
aVor taking it out of a stream bed.
p224
aVYou might be able to patent the process for mining the gold,
p225
aVbut you can't patent the gold itself.
p226
aVIt might've taken a lot of hard work and effort
p227
aVto dig the gold out of the mountain;
p228
aVyou still can't patent it, it's still gold.
p229
aVAnd the gold, once it's extracted,
p230
aVcan clearly be used for all sorts of things
p231
aVthat it couldn't be used for when it was in the mountain;
p232
aVyou can make jewelry out of it for example \u2014
p233
aVstill can't patent the gold, it's still gold.
p234
aa(lp235
VSo now it's 2009, and we're ready to file our case.
p236
aVWe filed in federal court in the Southern District of New York,
p237
aVand the case was randomly assigned to Judge Robert Sweet.
p238
aVIn March 2010, Judge Sweet issued his opinion \u2014
p239
aV152 pages \u2014
p240
aVand a complete victory for our side.
p241
aa(lp242
VIn reading the opinion,
p243
aVwe could not get over how eloquently he described the science in the case.
p244
aVI mean, our brief \u2014 it was pretty good,
p245
aVbut not this good.
p246
aVHow did he develop such a deep understanding of this issue
p247
aVin such a short time?
p248
aVWe just could not comprehend how this had happened.
p249
aVSo it turned out,
p250
aVJudge Sweet's clerk working for him at the time,
p251
aVwas not just a lawyer \u2014
p252
aVhe was a scientist.
p253
aVHe was not just a scientist \u2014
p254
aVhe had a PhD in molecular biology.
p255
aa(lp256
V(Laughter)
p257
aa(lp258
VWhat an incredible stroke of luck!
p259
aa(lp260
VMyriad then appealed
p261
aVto the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
p262
aVAnd here things got really interesting.
p263
aa(lp264
VFirst, in a pivotal moment of this case,
p265
aVthe US government switched sides.
p266
aa(lp267
VSo in the district court the government submitted a brief on Myriad's side.
p268
aVBut now in direct opposition to its own patent office,
p269
aVthe US government files a brief that states that is has
p270
aVreconsidered this issue in light of the district court's opinion,
p271
aVand has concluded that isolated DNA is not patent eligible.
p272
aVThis was a really big deal,
p273
aVtotally unexpected.
p274
aa(lp275
VThe Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
p276
aVhears all patent cases,
p277
aVand it has a reputation for being very, very pro-patent.
p278
aVSo even with this remarkable development,
p279
aVwe expected to lose.
p280
aVAnd we did.
p281
aVSort of.
p282
aVEnds up split decision, 2 to 1.
p283
aVBut the two judges who ruled against us,
p284
aVdid so for completely different reasons.
p285
aVThe first one, Judge Lourie,
p286
aVmade up his own novel, biological theory \u2014
p287
aVtotally wrong.
p288
aa(lp289
V(Laughter)
p290
aa(lp291
VHe decided Myriad had created a new chemical \u2014
p292
aVmade absolutely no sense.
p293
aVMyriad didn't even argue this, so it came out of the blue.
p294
aVThe other, Judge Moore,
p295
aVsaid she basically agreed with us that isolated DNA is a product of nature.
p296
aVBut she's like, "I don't want to shake up the biotech industry."
p297
aVThe third, Judge Bryson,
p298
aVagreed with us.
p299
aa(lp300
VSo now we sought review by the Supreme Court.
p301
aVAnd when you petition the Supreme Court,
p302
aVyou have to present a question that you want the Court to answer.
p303
aVUsually these questions take the form of a super-long paragraph,
p304
aVlike a whole page long with lots and lots of clauses,
p305
aV"wherein this" and "therefore that."
p306
aVWe submitted perhaps the shortest question presented ever.
p307
aVFour words:
p308
aVAre human genes patentable?
p309
aa(lp310
VNow when Chris first asked me what I thought of these words,
p311
aVI said, "Well, I don't know.
p312
aVI think you have to say, 'Is isolated DNA patentable?'"
p313
aa(lp314
V"Nope.
p315
aVI want the justices to have the very same reaction that I had
p316
aVwhen you brought this issue to me seven years ago."
p317
aa(lp318
VWell, I certainly couldn't argue with that.
p319
aa(lp320
VThe Supreme Court only hears about one percent
p321
aVof the cases that it receives,
p322
aVand it agreed to hear ours.
p323
aVThe day of the oral argument arrives, and it was really, really exciting \u2014
p324
aVlong line of people outside,
p325
aVpeople had been standing in line since 2:30 in the morning
p326
aVto try to get into the courthouse.
p327
aVTwo breast cancer organizations,
p328
aVBreast Cancer Action and FORCE,
p329
aVhad organized a demonstration on the courthouse steps.
p330
aa(lp331
VChris and I sat quietly in the hallway,
p332
aVmoments before he was to walk in and argue
p333
aVthe most important case of his career.
p334
aVI was clearly more nervous than he was.
p335
aVBut any remaining panic subsided as I walked into the courtroom
p336
aVand looked around at a sea of friendly faces:
p337
aVour individual women clients
p338
aVwho had shared their deeply personal stories,
p339
aVthe geneticists who had taken huge chunks of time out of their busy careers
p340
aVto dedicate themselves to this fight
p341
aVand representatives from a diverse array
p342
aVof medical, patient advocacy,
p343
aVenvironmental and religious organizations,
p344
aVwho had submitted friend of the court briefs in the case.
p345
aa(lp346
VAlso in the room were three leaders of the Human Genome Project,
p347
aVincluding the co-discoverer of DNA himself,
p348
aVJames Watson,
p349
aVwho had submitted a brief to the court,
p350
aVwhere he referred to gene patenting as "lunacy."
p351
aa(lp352
V(Laughter)
p353
aa(lp354
VThe diversity of the communities represented in this room
p355
aVand the contributions each had made to make this day a reality
p356
aVspoke volumes to what was at stake.
p357
aa(lp358
VThe argument itself was riveting.
p359
aVChris argued brilliantly.
p360
aVBut for me,
p361
aVthe most thrilling aspect was watching the Supreme Court justices grapple
p362
aVwith isolated DNA,
p363
aVthrough a series of colorful analogies and feisty exchanges,
p364
aVvery much the same way as our legal team had done
p365
aVfor the past seven years.
p366
aVJustice Kagan likened isolating DNA
p367
aVto extracting a medicinal plant from the Amazon.
p368
aVJustice Roberts distinguished it from carving a baseball bat from a tree.
p369
aVAnd in one of my absolutely favorite moments,
p370
aVJustice Sotomayor proclaimed isolated DNA to be "just nature sitting there."
p371
aa(lp372
V(Laughter)
p373
aa(lp374
VWe felt pretty confident leaving the courtroom that day,
p375
aVbut I could never have anticipated the outcome:
p376
aVnine to zero.
p377
aa(lp378
V"A naturally occurring DNA segment is a product of nature,
p379
aVand not patent-eligible merely because it has been isolated.
p380
aVAnd furthermore,
p381
aVMyriad did not create anything."
p382
aa(lp383
VWithin 24 hours of the decision,
p384
aVfive labs had announced
p385
aVthat they would begin to offer testing for the BRCA genes.
p386
aVSome of them promised to offer the tests at a lower price than Myriad's.
p387
aVSome promised to provide a more comprehensive test
p388
aVthan the one Myriad was offering.
p389
aa(lp390
VBut of course the decision goes far beyond Myriad.
p391
aVIt ends a 25-year practice of allowing patents on human genes
p392
aVin the United States.
p393
aVIt clears a significant barrier to biomedical discovery and innovation.
p394
aVAnd it helps to ensure that patients like Abigail, Kathleen and Eileen
p395
aVhave access to the tests that they need.
p396
aa(lp397
VA few weeks after the court issued its decision,
p398
aVI received a small package in the mail.
p399
aVIt was from Bob Cook-Deegan,
p400
aVa professor at Duke University
p401
aVand one the very first people Chris and I went to visit
p402
aVwhen we started to consider whether to bring this case.
p403
aVI opened it up to find a small stuffed animal.
p404
aa(lp405
V(Laughter)
p406
aa(lp407
VWe took a big risk in taking this case.
p408
aVPart of what gave us the courage to take that risk
p409
aVwas knowing that we were doing the right thing.
p410
aVThe process took nearly eight years from the start to finish,
p411
aVwith many twists and turns along the way.
p412
aVA little luck certainly helped,
p413
aVbut it was the communities that we bridged,
p414
aVthe alliances that we created,
p415
aVthat made pigs fly.
p416
