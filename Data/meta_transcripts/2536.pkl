VIchthyology,
p4
aVthe study of fishes.
p5
aVIt looks like a big, boring word,
p6
aVbut it's actually quite exciting,
p7
aVbecause ichthyology is the only "ology"
p8
aVwith "YOLO" in it.
p9
aa(lp10
V(Laughter)
p11
aa(lp12
VNow, to the cool kids in the audience,
p13
aVyou already know, YOLO stands for "you only live once,"
p14
aVand because I only have one life,
p15
aVI'm going to spend it doing what I always dreamt of doing:
p16
aVseeing the hidden wonders of the world and discovering new species.
p17
aVAnd that's what I get to do.
p18
aa(lp19
VNow, in recent years, I really focused on caves for finding new species.
p20
aVAnd it turns out, there's lots of new cavefish species out there.
p21
aVYou just have to know where to look,
p22
aVand to maybe be a little thin.
p23
aa(lp24
V(Laughter)
p25
aa(lp26
VNow, cavefishes can tell me a lot about biology and geology.
p27
aVThey can tell me how the landmasses around them have changed and moved
p28
aVby being stuck in these little holes,
p29
aVand they can tell me about the evolution of sight, by being blind.
p30
aa(lp31
VNow, fish have eyes that are essentially the same as ours.
p32
aVAll vertebrates do, and each time a fish species starts to adapt
p33
aVto this dark, cold, cave environment,
p34
aVover many, many generations, they lose their eyes and their eyesight
p35
aVuntil the end up like an eyeless cavefish like this one here.
p36
aVNow, each cavefish species has evolved in a slightly different way,
p37
aVand each one has a unique geological and biological story to tell us,
p38
aVand that's why it's so exciting when we find a new species.
p39
aa(lp40
VSo this is a new species we described, from southern Indiana.
p41
aVWe named it Amblyopsis hoosieri, the Hoosier cavefish.
p42
aa(lp43
V(Laughter)
p44
aa(lp45
VIts closest relatives are cavefishes in Kentucky,
p46
aVin the Mammoth Cave system.
p47
aVAnd they start to diverge when the Ohio River split them
p48
aVa few million years ago.
p49
aVAnd in that time they developed these subtle differences
p50
aVin the genetic architecture behind their blindness.
p51
aVThere's this gene called rhodopsin that's super-critical for sight.
p52
aVWe have it, and these species have it too,
p53
aVexcept one species has lost all function in that gene,
p54
aVand the other one maintains it.
p55
aVSo this sets up this beautiful natural experiment
p56
aVwhere we can look at the genes behind our vision,
p57
aVand at the very roots of how we can see.
p58
aa(lp59
VBut the genes in these cavefishes
p60
aVcan also tell us about deep geological time,
p61
aVmaybe no more so than in this species here.
p62
aVThis is a new species we described from Madagascar
p63
aVthat we named Typhleotris mararybe.
p64
aVThat means "big sickness" in Malagasy,
p65
aVfor how sick we got trying to collect this species.
p66
aVNow, believe it or not,
p67
aVswimming around sinkholes full of dead things
p68
aVand cave full of bat poop
p69
aVisn't the smartest thing you could be doing with your life,
p70
aVbut YOLO.
p71
aa(lp72
V(Laughter)
p73
aa(lp74
VNow, I love this species despite the fact that it tried to kill us,
p75
aVand that's because this species in Madagascar,
p76
aVits closest relatives are 6,000 kilometers away,
p77
aVcavefishes in Australia.
p78
aVNow, there's no way a three-inch-long freshwater cavefish
p79
aVcan swim across the Indian Ocean,
p80
aVso what we found when we compared the DNA of these species
p81
aVis that they've been separated for more than 100 million years,
p82
aVor about the time that the southern continents were last together.
p83
aVSo in fact, these species didn't move at all.
p84
aVIt's the continents that moved them.
p85
aVAnd so they give us, through their DNA,
p86
aVthis precise model and measure
p87
aVof how to date and time these ancient geological events.
p88
aa(lp89
VNow, this species here is so new
p90
aVI'm not even allowed to tell you its name yet,
p91
aVbut I can tell you it's a new species from Mexico,
p92
aVand it's probably already extinct.
p93
aVIt's probably extinct because the only known cave system it's from
p94
aVwas destroyed when a dam was built nearby.
p95
aVUnfortunately for cavefishes,
p96
aVtheir groundwater habitat
p97
aVis also our main source of drinking water.
p98
aa(lp99
VNow, we actually don't know this species' closest relative, yet.
p100
aVIt doesn't appear to be anything else in Mexico,
p101
aVso maybe it's something in Cuba,
p102
aVor Florida, or India.
p103
aVBut whatever it is, it might tell us something new about the geology
p104
aVof the Caribbean, or the biology of how to better diagnose
p105
aVcertain types of blindness.
p106
aVBut I hope we discover this species before it goes extinct too.
p107
aa(lp108
VAnd I'm going to spend my one life
p109
aVas an ichthyologist trying to discover and save
p110
aVthese humble little blind cavefishes
p111
aVthat can tell us so much about the geology of the planet
p112
aVand the biology of how we see.
p113
aa(lp114
VThank you.
