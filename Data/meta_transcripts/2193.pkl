VI grew up with my identical twin,
p4
aVwho was an incredibly loving brother.
p5
aVNow, one thing about being a twin is,
p6
aVit makes you an expert at spotting favoritism.
p7
aVIf his cookie was even slightly bigger than my cookie,
p8
aVI had questions.
p9
aVAnd clearly, I wasn't starving.
p10
aa(lp11
V(Laughter)
p12
aa(lp13
VWhen I became a psychologist, I began to notice favoritism
p14
aVof a different kind;
p15
aVand that is, how much more we value the body than we do the mind.
p16
aVI spent nine years at university earning my doctorate in psychology,
p17
aVand I can't tell you how many people look at my business card and say,
p18
aV"Oh \u2014 a psychologist. So, not a real doctor,"
p19
aVas if it should say that on my card.

p22
aa(lp23
V(Laughter)
p24
aa(lp25
VThis favoritism we show the body over the mind \u2014
p26
aVI see it everywhere.
p27
aa(lp28
VI recently was at a friend's house,
p29
aVand their five-year-old was getting ready for bed.
p30
aVHe was standing on a stool by the sink, brushing his teeth,
p31
aVwhen he slipped and scratched his leg on the stool when he fell.
p32
aVHe cried for a minute, but then he got back up,
p33
aVgot back on the stool, and reached out for a box of Band-Aids
p34
aVto put one on his cut.
p35
aVNow, this kid could barely tie his shoelaces,
p36
aVbut he knew you have to cover a cut so it doesn't become infected,
p37
aVand you have to care for your teeth by brushing twice a day.
p38
aVWe all know how to maintain our physical health
p39
aVand how to practice dental hygiene, right?
p40
aVWe've known it since we were five years old.
p41
aVBut what do we know about maintaining our psychological health?
p42
aVWell, nothing.
p43
aVWhat do we teach our children about emotional hygiene?
p44
aVNothing.
p45
aVHow is it that we spend more time taking care of our teeth
p46
aVthan we do our minds?
p47
aVWhy is it that our physical health is so much more important to us
p48
aVthan our psychological health?
p49
aa(lp50
VWe sustain psychological injuries even more often than we do physical ones,
p51
aVinjuries like failure or rejection or loneliness.
p52
aVAnd they can also get worse if we ignore them,
p53
aVand they can impact our lives in dramatic ways.
p54
aVAnd yet, even though there are scientifically proven techniques
p55
aVwe could use to treat these kinds of psychological injuries,
p56
aVwe don't.
p57
aVIt doesn't even occur to us that we should.
p58
aV"Oh, you're feeling depressed? Just shake it off; it's all in your head."
p59
aVCan you imagine saying that to somebody with a broken leg:
p60
aV"Oh, just walk it off; it's all in your leg."
p61
aa(lp62
V(Laughter)
p63
aa(lp64
VIt is time we closed the gap
p65
aVbetween our physical and our psychological health.
p66
aVIt's time we made them more equal,
p67
aVmore like twins.
p68
aa(lp69
VSpeaking of which, my brother is also a psychologist.
p70
aVSo he's not a real doctor, either.
p71
aa(lp72
V(Laughter)
p73
aa(lp74
VWe didn't study together, though.
p75
aVIn fact, the hardest thing I've ever done in my life
p76
aVis move across the Atlantic to New York City
p77
aVto get my doctorate in psychology.
p78
aVWe were apart then for the first time in our lives,
p79
aVand the separation was brutal for both of us.
p80
aVBut while he remained among family and friends,
p81
aVI was alone in a new country.
p82
aVWe missed each other terribly,
p83
aVbut international phone calls were really expensive then,
p84
aVand we could only afford to speak for five minutes a week.
p85
aVWhen our birthday rolled around,
p86
aVit was the first we wouldn't be spending together.
p87
aVWe decided to splurge,
p88
aVand that week, we would talk for 10 minutes.
p89
aa(lp90
V(Laughter)
p91
aa(lp92
VI spent the morning pacing around my room, waiting for him to call \u2014
p93
aVand waiting ...
p94
aVand waiting.
p95
aVBut the phone didn't ring.
p96
aVGiven the time difference, I assumed,
p97
aV"OK, he's out with friends, he'll call later."
p98
aVThere were no cell phones then.
p99
aVBut he didn't.
p100
aVAnd I began to realize that after being away for over 10 months,
p101
aVhe no longer missed me the way I missed him.
p102
aVI knew he would call in the morning,
p103
aVbut that night was one of the saddest and longest nights of my life.
p104
aVI woke up the next morning.
p105
aVI glanced down at the phone,
p106
aVand I realized I had kicked it off the hook
p107
aVwhen pacing the day before.
p108
aVI stumbled out of bed,
p109
aVI put the phone back on the receiver, and it rang a second later.
p110
aVAnd it was my brother,
p111
aVand boy, was he pissed.
p112
aa(lp113
V(Laughter)
p114
aa(lp115
VIt was the saddest and longest night of his life as well.
p116
aVNow, I tried to explain what happened, but he said,
p117
aV"I don't understand.
p118
aVIf you saw I wasn't calling you,
p119
aVwhy didn't you just pick up the phone and call me?"
p120
aVHe was right.
p121
aVWhy didn't I call him?
p122
aVI didn't have an answer then.
p123
aVBut I do today,
p124
aVand it's a simple one:
p125
aVloneliness.
p126
aa(lp127
VLoneliness creates a deep psychological wound,
p128
aVone that distorts our perceptions and scrambles our thinking.
p129
aVIt makes us believe that those around us care much less than they actually do.
p130
aVIt make us really afraid to reach out,
p131
aVbecause why set yourself up for rejection and heartache
p132
aVwhen your heart is already aching more than you can stand?
p133
aVI was in the grips of real loneliness back then,
p134
aVbut I was surrounded by people all day, so it never occurred to me.
p135
aVBut loneliness is defined purely subjectively.
p136
aVIt depends solely on whether you feel emotionally or socially disconnected
p137
aVfrom those around you.
p138
aVAnd I did.
p139
aVThere is a lot of research on loneliness, and all of it is horrifying.
p140
aVLoneliness won't just make you miserable;
p141
aVit will kill you.
p142
aVI'm not kidding.
p143
aVChronic loneliness increases your likelihood of an early death
p144
aVby 14 percent.
p145
aVFourteen percent!
p146
aVLoneliness causes high blood pressure,
p147
aVhigh cholesterol.
p148
aVIt even suppress the functioning of your immune system,
p149
aVmaking you vulnerable to all kinds of illnesses and diseases.
p150
aVIn fact, scientists have concluded that taken together,
p151
aVchronic loneliness poses as significant a risk
p152
aVfor your long-term health and longevity
p153
aVas cigarette smoking.
p154
aVNow, cigarette packs come with warnings saying, "This could kill you."
p155
aVBut loneliness doesn't.
p156
aVAnd that's why it's so important
p157
aVthat we prioritize our psychological health,
p158
aVthat we practice emotional hygiene.
p159
aVBecause you can't treat a psychological wound
p160
aVif you don't even know you're injured.
p161
aVLoneliness isn't the only psychological wound
p162
aVthat distorts our perceptions and misleads us.
p163
aa(lp164
VFailure does that as well.
p165
aVI once visited a day care center,
p166
aVwhere I saw three toddlers play with identical plastic toys.
p167
aVYou had to slide the red button, and a cute doggie would pop out.
p168
aVOne little girl tried pulling the purple button, then pushing it,
p169
aVand then she just sat back and looked at the box
p170
aVwith her lower lip trembling.
p171
aVThe little boy next to her watched this happen,
p172
aVthen turned to his box and burst into tears without even touching it.
p173
aVMeanwhile, another little girl tried everything she could think of
p174
aVuntil she slid the red button,
p175
aVthe cute doggie popped out, and she squealed with delight.
p176
aVSo: three toddlers with identical plastic toys,
p177
aVbut with very different reactions to failure.
p178
aVThe first two toddlers were perfectly capable of sliding a red button.
p179
aVThe only thing that prevented them from succeeding
p180
aVwas that their mind tricked them into believing they could not.
p181
aVNow, adults get tricked this way as well, all the time.
p182
aVIn fact, we all have a default set of feelings and beliefs
p183
aVthat gets triggered whenever we encounter frustrations and setbacks.
p184
aa(lp185
VAre you aware of how your mind reacts to failure?
p186
aVYou need to be.
p187
aVBecause if your mind tries to convince you you're incapable of something,
p188
aVand you believe it,
p189
aVthen like those two toddlers, you'll begin to feel helpless
p190
aVand you'll stop trying too soon, or you won't even try at all.
p191
aVAnd then you'll be even more convinced you can't succeed.
p192
aVYou see, that's why so many people function below their actual potential.
p193
aVBecause somewhere along the way, sometimes a single failure
p194
aVconvinced them that they couldn't succeed, and they believed it.
p195
aa(lp196
VOnce we become convinced of something, it's very difficult to change our mind.
p197
aVI learned that lesson the hard way when I was a teenager with my brother.
p198
aVWe were driving with friends down a dark road at night,
p199
aVwhen a police car stopped us.
p200
aVThere had been a robbery in the area and they were looking for suspects.
p201
aVThe officer approached the car, and shined his flashlight on the driver,
p202
aVthen on my brother in the front seat,
p203
aVand then on me.
p204
aVAnd his eyes opened wide and he said,
p205
aV"Where have I seen your face before?"
p206
aa(lp207
V(Laughter)
p208
aa(lp209
VAnd I said,
p210
aV"In the front seat."
p211
aa(lp212
V(Laughter)
p213
aa(lp214
VBut that made no sense to him whatsoever,
p215
aVso now he thought I was on drugs.
p216
aa(lp217
V(Laughter)
p218
aa(lp219
VSo he drags me out of the car, he searches me,
p220
aVhe marches me over to the police car,
p221
aVand only when he verified I didn't have a police record,
p222
aVcould I show him I had a twin in the front seat.
p223
aVBut even as we were driving away,
p224
aVyou could see by the look on his face he was convinced
p225
aVthat I was getting away with something.
p226
aa(lp227
V(Laughter)
p228
aa(lp229
VOur mind is hard to change once we become convinced.
p230
aVSo it might be very natural to feel demoralized
p231
aVand defeated after you fail.
p232
aVBut you cannot allow yourself to become convinced you can't succeed.
p233
aVYou have to fight feelings of helplessness.
p234
aVYou have to gain control over the situation.
p235
aVAnd you have to break this kind of negative cycle
p236
aVbefore it begins.
p237
aa(lp238
V[Stop Emotional Bleeding]
p239
aa(lp240
VOur minds and our feelings \u2014
p241
aVthey're not the trustworthy friends we thought they were.
p242
aVThey're more like a really moody friend,
p243
aVwho can be totally supportive one minute, and really unpleasant the next.
p244
aVI once worked with this woman who, after 20 years marriage
p245
aVand an extremely ugly divorce,
p246
aVwas finally ready for her first date.
p247
aVShe had met this guy online,
p248
aVand he seemed nice and he seemed successful,
p249
aVand most importantly, he seemed really into her.
p250
aVSo she was very excited, she bought a new dress,
p251
aVand they met at an upscale New York City bar for a drink.
p252
aVTen minutes into the date, the man stands up and says,
p253
aV"I'm not interested," and walks out.
p254
aVRejection is extremely painful.
p255
aVThe woman was so hurt she couldn't move.
p256
aVAll she could do was call a friend.
p257
aVHere's what the friend said: "Well, what do you expect?
p258
aVYou have big hips, you have nothing interesting to say.
p259
aVWhy would a handsome, successful man like that
p260
aVever go out with a loser like you?"
p261
aVShocking, right, that a friend could be so cruel?
p262
aVBut it would be much less shocking
p263
aVif I told you it wasn't the friend who said that.
p264
aVIt's what the woman said to herself.
p265
aVAnd that's something we all do,
p266
aVespecially after a rejection.
p267
aVWe all start thinking of all our faults and all our shortcomings,
p268
aVwhat we wish we were, what we wish we weren't.
p269
aVWe call ourselves names.
p270
aVMaybe not as harshly, but we all do it.
p271
aVAnd it's interesting that we do,
p272
aVbecause our self-esteem is already hurting.
p273
aVWhy would we want to go and damage it even further?
p274
aVWe wouldn't make a physical injury worse on purpose.
p275
aVYou wouldn't get a cut on your arm and decide, "Oh! I know \u2014
p276
aVI'm going to take a knife and see how much deeper I can make it."
p277
aa(lp278
VBut we do that with psychological injuries all the time.
p279
aVWhy? Because of poor emotional hygiene.
p280
aVBecause we don't prioritize our psychological health.
p281
aVWe know from dozens of studies that when your self-esteem is lower,
p282
aVyou are more vulnerable to stress and to anxiety;
p283
aVthat failures and rejections hurt more,
p284
aVand it takes longer to recover from them.
p285
aVSo when you get rejected, the first thing you should be doing
p286
aVis to revive your self-esteem,
p287
aVnot join Fight Club and beat it into a pulp.
p288
aVWhen you're in emotional pain,
p289
aVtreat yourself with the same compassion
p290
aVyou would expect from a truly good friend.
p291
aa(lp292
V[Protect Your Self-Esteem]
p293
aa(lp294
VWe have to catch our unhealthy psychological habits and change them.
p295
aVAnd one of unhealthiest and most common is called rumination.
p296
aVTo ruminate means to chew over.
p297
aVIt's when your boss yells at you
p298
aVor your professor makes you feel stupid in class,
p299
aVor you have big fight with a friend
p300
aVand you just can't stop replaying the scene in your head for days,
p301
aVsometimes for weeks on end.
p302
aVNow, ruminating about upsetting events in this way can easily become a habit,
p303
aVand it's a very costly one,
p304
aVbecause by spending so much time focused on upsetting and negative thoughts,
p305
aVyou are actually putting yourself at significant risk
p306
aVfor developing clinical depression,
p307
aValcoholism,
p308
aVeating disorders,
p309
aVand even cardiovascular disease.
p310
aa(lp311
VThe problem is,
p312
aVthe urge to ruminate can feel really strong and really important,
p313
aVso it's a difficult habit to stop.
p314
aVI know this for a fact,
p315
aVbecause a little over a year ago, I developed the habit myself.
p316
aVYou see, my twin brother was diagnosed with stage 3 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
p317
aVHis cancer was extremely aggressive.
p318
aVHe had visible tumors all over his body.
p319
aVAnd he had to start a harsh course of chemotherapy.
p320
aVAnd I couldn't stop thinking about what he was going through.
p321
aVI couldn't stop thinking about how much he was suffering,
p322
aVeven though he never complained, not once.
p323
aVHe had this incredibly positive attitude.
p324
aVHis psychological health was amazing.
p325
aVI was physically healthy, but psychologically, I was a mess.
p326
aVBut I knew what to do.
p327
aVStudies tell us that even a two-minute distraction is sufficient
p328
aVto break the urge to ruminate in that moment.
p329
aVAnd so each time I had a worrying, upsetting, negative thought,
p330
aVI forced myself to concentrate on something else until the urge passed.
p331
aVAnd within one week, my whole outlook changed
p332
aVand became more positive and more hopeful.
p333
aa(lp334
V[Battle Negative Thinking]
p335
aa(lp336
VNine weeks after he started chemotherapy, my brother had a CAT scan,
p337
aVand I was by his side when he got the results.
p338
aVAll the tumors were gone.
p339
aVHe still had three more rounds of chemotherapy to go,
p340
aVbut we knew he would recover.
p341
aVThis picture was taken two weeks ago.
p342
aa(lp343
VBy taking action when you're lonely,
p344
aVby changing your responses to failure,
p345
aVby protecting your self-esteem,
p346
aVby battling negative thinking,
p347
aVyou won't just heal your psychological wounds,
p348
aVyou will build emotional resilience,
p349
aVyou will thrive.
p350
aVA hundred years ago, people began practicing personal hygiene,
p351
aVand life expectancy rates rose by over 50 percent
p352
aVin just a matter of decades.
p353
aVI believe our quality of life could rise just as dramatically
p354
aVif we all began practicing emotional hygiene.
p355
aa(lp356
VCan you imagine what the world would be like
p357
aVif everyone was psychologically healthier?
p358
aVIf there were less loneliness and less depression?
p359
aVIf people knew how to overcome failure?
p360
aVIf they felt better about themselves and more empowered?
p361
aVIf they were happier and more fulfilled?
p362
aVI can, because that's the world I want to live in.
p363
aVAnd that's the world my brother wants to live in as well.
p364
aVAnd if you just become informed and change a few simple habits, well \u2014
p365
aVthat's the world we can all live in.
